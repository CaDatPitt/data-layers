This extension layers contributes latitute and longitude coordinates as well as modern-day street addresses corresponding to events held in and around Pittsburgh that are mentioned in items within the [Communist Collection of A.E. Forbes](https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/communist-collection-ae-forbes). This data helps researchers visualize the Communist network in Pittsburgh and identify neighborhoods with greater or lesser Communist activity. This layer also includes a "Precision" field where discrepancies about locational data and ranges of confidence are mentioned; entries with no precision data are high confidence.
