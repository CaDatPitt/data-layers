This extension layer describes a subset of the fliers and pamphlets from the [Communist Collection of A.E. Forbes](https://digital.library.pitt.edu/collection/communist-collection-ae-forbes), containing information for 55 items which advertised events within the city of Pittsburgh. This data provides the ID and title of each item, creators, dates and abstracts from ULS Digital Collections, as well as the street address and latitude and longitude of each event location, with a note of the current status of the location (i.e., still standing).

#### Notes

- [`data-dictionary_elements.csv`](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/blob/master/extension-layers/communist-collection-forbes/event-location-data_stockton/data-dictionary_elements.csv): provides the name (as represented in the CSV column), display name (or label), description, acceptable values, and (sometimes) notes for each element.
