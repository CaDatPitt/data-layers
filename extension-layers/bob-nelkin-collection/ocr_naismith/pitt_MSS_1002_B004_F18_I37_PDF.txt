Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
The physicians of Erie County Express our concern about the recent firing of Dr. James McClelland, superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital.
Over the years, as professionals, we have had great respect for his capabilities, and many of our patients have members of their families as residents of that institution. Up to the present time, we are not aware of any complaints from these partents concerning the manner in which their family members are treated at Polk State School and Hospital. Almost unanimously, during the period of time since the infamous deed on the part of state officials in dismissing this fine physician was perpetrated, our patients have had only words of commendation for this physician.
We strongly abhor your actions in allowing this fine man, who has devoted his entire life to the medical profession, and, particularly, to the care of retarded citizens of the state, to be fired in the manner that it was done.
We do not believe that the stated reasons; namely, the use of large play pens in this'institution have any merit or justification since they are, in fact, a humane measure of controlling the hyperactive retarded people. In the strongest terms, we encourage you to reinstate Dr. McClelland to his former position.
Sincerely,
ERIE COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY
William D. Lamberton, M.D. President
