Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth, Secretary Department of Public Welfare Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120
Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
Cameron County Association of Retarded Children would like to take this opportunity to register their disapproval of the handling of the discharge of Dr. McClelland from Polk State School and Hospital. More complete investigation and hearing should be held, both of the conditions at Polk and Dr. McClellands responibilty for these conditions. Also we believe that Dr. McClelland should have recognition for his years of service to the school and the review of his case as an employee of the State of Pennsylvania.
We are of the opinion that if sufficient moneies were available from the Department of Public Welfare those objectionable measures would not have to have been used if proper programs could have been instituted.
Sincerely,
i
(Mrs.) Inez Jordan President

CAMERON COUNTY ASSOCIATION of RETARDED CHILDREN
