FROM: BOB NELKIN
Mrs.	(781-0265), a parent of a Mitchell Home resident called to file
her minority report to our minority report.
Basically, her son is receiving better care and is happier at Mitchell than he was at W.S.S.H.
We might complain about medical care, but when he had virus they put him in an Isolation room and prescribed drugs.
We might complain about overcrowd i ng, but it was the same way at W.S.S.H.
When Gary was at W.S.S.H. he almost had his ear bitten off by another resident — he’s been at Mitchell 2 years and she is aware of no abuse to him.
And on with similar examples — equally as valid.
She agreed that there is room for a lot of improvement.
I don’t want to shelter you from criticism — so I pass this on.
By the end of our conversation, anger was replaced by "concern”.
She said she heard a person on our team had a son who has a paper route, lives at home, etc. This person (from our team) feels there should be no residential homes.
