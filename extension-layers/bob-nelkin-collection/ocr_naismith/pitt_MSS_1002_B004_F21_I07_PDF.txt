Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth
I cannot let such actions as yours go by without comment and tell you how discussed the general public is with you. It is showing how little you know about the position you hold. Enclosed is an article you might well digest.
How can you have the interest of the Institution at Polk with such decisions? You are badly informed and have reached very poor judgment;. Would you like to take a case or two into your home and learn first hand what has to be done - no you haven’t time.
Even a lay persons such as I can understand the explanation of cages as playpens in preference to drugs and thongs. It all sounds so preposterous and unreal to go about a change in this fashion - and you a learned woman - I suppose.
Take your problems to Governor Shapp - no help there except to find jobs for the friends and neighbors. You have raised the ire of all Pennsylvania and we don’t like it or what you stand for.
Very truly,
Elise Nystrom
