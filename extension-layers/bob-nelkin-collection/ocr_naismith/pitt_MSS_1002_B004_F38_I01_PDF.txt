Dear Nick:

Thank you very much for providing me with a copy of the newly created "Policies and Procedures for the Guidance and Discipline of Residents". X see this as a very useful guide for employees at Polk.
I would like to have something like this if I were an employee at Polk. I rm sharing the pages on sexuality ’dth some ACC-PARC staff, and Planned Parenthood of Pittsburgh. I hope that they will come up with some comments.
I disagree with only one area: the use of restraint.
The use of restraint should be prohibited entirely. Although you have better defined the use of mechanical restraint^ its presence in this guide represents an endorsement by the Committee and the Achninistration.
I am interested in your long-range plans.
Lon^-range, do you intend to eliminate the use of restraint at Polk State School and Hospital?
What is your goal for the policy on use of mechanical restraints?
What is the timetable for the elimination of the use of mechanical restraint and the introduction of alternatives?

Mr. Nick D’/luisio
If you do not have a plan for the elimination of mechanical restraint, will you be developing one?
Again9 with the exception of this one area, I was impressed with the staff guide as a beginning.
Thank you very much, and I hope to hear from you soon.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin Associate Executive
