Donald Hartley, Ph.D, Superintendent
Alfredo Reyes, M.D.
Medical Director
Last week I sent you a memo requesting information and reports of the dental reviews which have taken place in Ebensburg Center. To date I have not received a reply from you and am enclosing an additional copy of that memo for your review.
In addition, I would also like the following information:
I would like to know who or what department initiated the original dental review performed in July, 1978 by Dr. Jay Resnik. I would like to know why proper channels were ignored. I was not informed this man was coming to the Center and I was not given the opportunity to review his credentials or to even be sure he was a licensed dentist in the state of Pennsylvania. I have not been presented with any documentation to prove that he or any of the other dentists examining the residents of this Center are even qualified dentists.
The Medical Staff By-Laws state the Medical Director shall be consulted prior to the appointment of any consulting physicians/dentists, etc. I was not consulted or even informed of exactly what was going on at this Center. I was not told the dentists names, presented with any credentials, told how payment would be made or anything else.
Why aren’t the unit physicians being consulted concerning any of the dental treatment. These dentists are coming on grounds and performing dental work, including extractions, on residents without even consulting the unit physicians or for that matter obtaining parental consent. It may surprise you but several of these residents are not in the best of health and even simple procedures such as tooth extractions are placing their lives in danger. I most certainly feel the unit physicians should have been consulted in these matters. I have received complaints from the physicians concerning these procedures and their complaints are certainly justified.
Also, when additional dentists were brought to the Center to validate Dr. Resnik’s charges, why was he brought in to do some of the follow-up examinations. Don’t you think it is a bit ridiculous for a man to make accusations and then be allowed to justify his own accusations without the review of any other dentists.
If the dental conditions are so bad, why were Dr. Brisini’s requests for dental eqiupment ignored in the past years. Why were the vacancies left by his dental assistant and hygienist left vacant for years. Why didn’t these problems matter when they were brought to your attention years ago.

By what authority did Dr. Resnik and the other dentists (I have not even been given their names) perform extractions. I do know for a fact that Dr. Resnik extracted teeth from a resident in Unit IV but do not by whose authority. Is he on contract as a consulting physician/dentist. Are the other dentists also on contract. I do not understand how these dentists, who are not on the staff, can go about freely treating the residents. Does this mean any physician or person pretending to be a physician can walk in off the streets and treat the residents.
Why wasn’t Dr. Brisini consulted at all concerning the treatment of the residents. No matter what your personal opinion of Dr. Brisini is, he does have over twenty years of service with the state and is more familiar with the residents than any consulting dentists in the state or country.
Allowing these dentists to treat the residents without consulting with Dr. Brisini, the Unit Physician or myself is in direct violation of the standards of this Center.
Again, neither I nor Dr. Brisini has been presented with any evidence that any of these dentists are qualified or licensed to practice in the state of Pennsylvania.
I would also like information on the qualifications and status of Dr. Balachak who (I found out through the grapevine) is visiting the institution on week-ends and examining residents, who incidentally, have already been checked by other dentists. Again, I have not been presented with any credentials for this man or consulted in any way.
Have these dentists actually been hired on our staff? Are they on contract? Are they under the supervision of Dr. Brisini? This would be the proper procedure.
The Medical Department By-Laws state these men are to be interviewed by the Medical Director; however, I have not even met these men.
As a matter of courtesy these men should all have been introduced to Dr. Brisini. Also, why did you tell Dr. Brisini he is not to perform any further tooth extractions. He told you he was willing to follow the recommendations of these dentists but you told him to perform only routine dental exams. Isn’t this a bit ridiculous as all the residents have now been examined over and over again.
I have never been consulted or informed as to what the purpose of these exams is or by whose authority these reviews are being performed.
I shall appreciate some answers to these questions as soon as possible.
