Dear Sally:
Ginnie Thornburgh shared your memo of September 17 to the ACC Board with me at the Ad Hoc Planning Committee Meeting on September 21. In the support documents entitled "closing of admissions at Western State School & Hospital", there was a section labeled "DPW fraud", in which you accused Western State School & Hospital of misuse of medical assistance funds.
Can you factually substantiate this? Do you know if there are any waivers in force that permit Western State School & Hospital to receive medical assistance funds although not in full compliance with the federal regulations? Do you know if there are medical assistance funds being paid for individuals who do not qualify under the regulations?
I'm sure that Ginnie has informed you about our meeting with Michael Lottman, U.S. Deputy Attorney General earlier this year. Mr. Lottman needs factual information to present to his management in order for him to initiate a federal Right to Treatment suit in Pennsylvania. Documented misuse of federal funds by the Department of Public Welfare at Western State School & Hospital, would be most useful. If you have the evidence, please put Ginnie in touch with me so that we might set up another meeting with Mr. Lottman.
Best wishes for a successful year,
L. Steuart Brown Pres ident
