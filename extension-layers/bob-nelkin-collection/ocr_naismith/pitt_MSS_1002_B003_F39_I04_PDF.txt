Dear r. cott:
We are at a loss to understand why several staff members approached you with a memorandum dated 2/5/73 detailing ground rules for unannounced visits. It is indeed true that a meiber of the Board of trustees is to be include and they have always had prior notice, as was the case on the May 13th visit. If no member of the Hoard is able to be present (as has been the situation on numerous occasions), the other members have made the unannounced visit without a member of the Board bein . present and no staff member had ever objected prior to this. e are wondorin what has occasioned their concern?
We shall be glad to have this
June 10 Liaison Com >itt< e meet.tn *.
included on the a :enda at the
Sincerely,
