JOINT VISITATION TEAM VISIT AND
LIAISON COMMITTEE MEETING (December 19/74
The Parents Group members who were present at the Liaison Committee Meeting held to determine the apparent cause in the deterioration of the Pood Service were a lied at some of the answers received ano would like these cues ions to be considered with the Joint Visitation Team answer, since they were not answered at the Liaisi n Committee meeting.
1)	why are fresh fruits, vegetables, and salads not served oxi a more regular basis to the residents?
Answer:	Doctors don’t want residents to get fresh
goods because it causes diarrhea.
Thor was no comment to this by the medical director who was present. May we please havo an answer.
2)	Who gave the orders re fresh fruits etc?
Answer: I refuse to say.
Is there a communication problem here?
3)	Mrs. ^ebb seemed hostile, defensive, angry. Ihis is understandable because of the death of a resident due
to strangulation. She was, however, hostile, defensive, and uncooperative at previous meetings when no death had occurred•
What does the administration feel is the reason for this employee’s attitude?
4)	->ince the medical department is raponsibl for assigning the type of tray given, Dr. Bradley was asked if she ever visits the lodges, Ginca the answer was negative, we gather "the ivory tower” syndrone still exi? s at Western and we are wondering when, if ever, the day is going to come when the Superintendent and Medical Director cun be released from the burden of treir desk jobs to
get out on the lodges, days, nights, weekends, and get a look at these problems firsthand. What is their opinion on this?
