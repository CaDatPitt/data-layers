THE SITUATION at Polk is to be pitied. The overcrowing is certainly not the fault of Dr. James McClelland the superintendent „	who was fired this past week.
The institution had done a remarkable job considering the limitations under which it has been placed.
Judging from the uproar this week most people closely connected with the institution feel that Dr. McClelland was doing the best he could.
Frankly, we don’t recall hearing any complaints.
