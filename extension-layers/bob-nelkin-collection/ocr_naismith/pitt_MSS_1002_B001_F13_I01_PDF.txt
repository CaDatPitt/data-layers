Dear Mr. Beal:
This letter is in regard to the very dire need for a Behavior Management Unit at Southwest Habilitation Center. As you know, this unit has been requested since April, 1974.
Recently, due to a behavior problem of some residents, there have been several disturbing occurrences and a breakdown in the training of our relatives. As a result, we are now forced to ask for an immediate decision on this matter. We would hope that it will not take a serious tragedy to bring this unit into being •
We believe, even with all the ’’red tape1' of government agencies, this matter is long overdue for action. We have had a promise several times that this plan was approved, but now we need more than a promise.
Our family group meets monthly, and we would like to invite you to attend our meeting on Sunday, September 12, 1976 at 3 p.m. at the Benge Building of Mayview Hospital to tell us your views on this matter. If for some reason this data is not convenient for you, please advise me as so>n as possible of an alternate date when you can meet with our group.
Enclosed is a stamped self-addressed envelope for your convenience in replying.
Very truly yours,
FAMILIES & FRIENDS OF
SOUTHWEST HABILITATION CENTER
