SUBJECT: Recent Death at Polk State School and Hospital
DATE:	May 6, 1975
Enclosed please find information gathered from Polk State School and Hospital regarding the Carl Fisher death. The information enclosed and the information obtained from my personal investigation indicate cause of death was accidental.
I still have questions regarding two issues:
1)	The definition of a ’’undetermined" cause of death. Some how it is hard for me to digest this ruling.
2)	Joe Columbatto mentioned that the State Police conducted a thorough investigation; when I inquired about Carl’s death from the staff at Hillcrest Cottage, they stated no one from the State Police Department came to question them about the incident.
