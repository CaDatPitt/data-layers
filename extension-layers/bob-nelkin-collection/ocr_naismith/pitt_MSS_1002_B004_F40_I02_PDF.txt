Dear Ginny:
This is in reply to your letter of February 10 to Mr. Norman J. Taylor concerning the 406 Court Commitments to Polk State School. As you know, this office — and the Superintendent of Polk State School — are totally opposed to court commitments to State Schools and have vigorously opposed them.
Quite honestly, in these two (2) cases^that happened nearly simultaneously, Erie County judges caught us off guard. We tried to react and even thought one commitment had been blocked.
We are endeavoring to motivate County Administrators and Base Service Units to work more closely with the courts. I might say that the problem appears to be greater in the Northwest corner than in the counties contiguous to Allegheny.
I will keep you
advised.
Commissioner of Mental Retardation
