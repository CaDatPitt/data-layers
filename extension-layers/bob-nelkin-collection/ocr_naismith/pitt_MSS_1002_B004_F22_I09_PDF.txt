Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
I was very disheartened to read in the newspapers of your discharging Dr. McClelland from his position as Superintendent of Polk State School.
It is not my intent to uphold or condemn the action of Dr. McClelland but only to relay to you the wonderful relationship that has existed between Dr. McClelland and my family over the years, concerning my brother who is confined at Polk State School.
It is not possible to relay to you the many, many times that ie became necessary to contact Dr. McClelland about problems that arose over the years concerning the welfare of my brother. Not once that I can recall did we not receive prompt and courteous if not sometimes personal attention from Dr. McClelland. It is my opinion that Dr. McClelland is an exceptional man in his filed of endeavor, a man of compassion, integrity and devotion to his work.
Perhaps you should consult some of the families of the inmates there and maybe you can understand what it was like at Polk State School before Dr. McClelland became Superintendent. Believe me, Mrs. Wohlgemuth, if you could have seen the conditions then, you would not have been able to sleep the rest of your days. The conditions then as compared to now are inconceivable if not witnessed first hand.
It would take many pages to illustrate the many accomplishments of Dr. McClelland at Polk State School these past 15 years. Nevertheless it behooves me to speak out in the good Doctor's behalf. I, therefore, most humbly request you to reconsider your decision in dismissing Dr. McClelland and take into consideration his past history and accomplishments, and not yield to pressure groups such as the P.A.R.C., but base your opinion on facts that can only be supplied by those individuals who have been exposed to actual past and present conditions at Polk.
Needless to say, I am very concerned over your action and the possible adverse effect it may have, not only on my brother but the Institution as a whole.
I would appreciate an early reply.
