Dear Norm,
As a result of a recent inspection at Polk it was revealed that the 110 electric beds which were to have been sent to Polk from Marcy have not yet arrived. Nor does anybody from Polk seem to know when (or if) they will arrive.
On three separate occasions, PARC has been told that the electric beds at Marcy were being sent to Polk.
As we are all well aware, these beds are desperately needed by Polk residents. The conditions of many of the beds and mattresses on which Polk residents sleep ranges from pathetic to outrageous. If this situation can be remedied for 110 residents, this would be, at the very least, an act of kindness. To deprive people of this necessity, on the other hand, is needless cruelty.
I earnestly hope that the transfer of these beds from Marcy to Polk is not bogged down in some morass of paperwork somewhere or that these beds have ended up in another facility!
let me know
Would you please look into this situation personally, as soon as possible what is happening?
and
Sincerely,
Marlene Burda, Chairman
PARC Residential
