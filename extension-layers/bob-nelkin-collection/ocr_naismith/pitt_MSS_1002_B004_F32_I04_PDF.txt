Dear Mrs. Calloway:
Although our association has not been totally satisfied with the quality of Polk Dispersal programs, we are pleased with the number of people who have been able to leave Polk and move to smaller facilities in the community.
We are concerned that there has been a lull in the planning for additional movements of people from Polk to the community.
1)	Do you plan additional movements of people from Polk to the community?
2)	If so, then what are your most immediate plans?
3)	How will citizens and advocates be involved in this planning?
Our association will continue to support dispersal of people from over populated institutions and to support the development of creative and more effective programs in the community.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin
Associate Executive Director
