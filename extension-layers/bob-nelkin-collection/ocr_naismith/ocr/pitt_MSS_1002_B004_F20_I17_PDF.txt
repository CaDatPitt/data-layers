Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth State Welfare Sect. Harrisburg, Pa.

Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
I want to protest most strongly the precipitent dismissal of Dr. McClelland from the Polk State School. Especially to do this without any hearing or full, investigation is unbelievable in responsible administration. I strongly urge you to have a full and fair investigation made.

I.
Sincerely yours,
C. W, Baldwd n
