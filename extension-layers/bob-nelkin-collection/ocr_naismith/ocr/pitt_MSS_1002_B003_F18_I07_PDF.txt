Mr. Robert Hiltner, Superintendent Western State School and Hospital 333 Curry Hill Road Canonsburg, Pa. 15317
Dear Bob,
At the Liaison Committee Meeting on Thursday, December 19, 1974, Mrs. Webb failed to answer questions regarding orders to change certain food procedures. She suggested that the Liaison Committee review "the record" to discover the answers which she refused to supply. That is the cause for this letter.
Mrs. Webb stated that she would like to serve fresh fruit and vegetables every day. She doesn’t serve them because certain (unnamed) individuals say fresh fruit and vegetables cause diarrhea.
Our question is, who instructed Mrs. Webb not to 8erve~~fresh fruit and vegetables because it causes diarrhea?
Mrs. Webb stated that dietary staff are now cutting french fries into little pieces. She did not understand why that was necessary and would not name the official who instructed her to serve french fries in this manner.
Our question is, who instructed Mrs. Webb and her dietary staff to cut french fries into little pieces?
Mrs. Webb said that dietary is now pulverizing oranges into orange juice because people are scared to serve orange wedges. She did not seem satisfied with this procedure, but was unwilling to tell us who ordered this.
Our question is, who instructed Mrs. Webb to pulverize oranges into orange juice rather than serving the orange wedges?

The Liaison Committee members were told that food which used to be sliced was now being diced. And food that used to be diced is now being pureed. Mrs. Webb, like other staff, was not pleased over this change, but was unwilling to inform us who instructed this change.
Our question is, who instructed Mrs. Webb to dice food that uaed to bo sliced, and to puree food that uaed to be diced?	’
Since we were unable to get the answers to these very basic questions at the December 19th meeting, it was necessary to put these questions in writing.
Sincerely,
		Robert Nelkin Associate Executive Director
