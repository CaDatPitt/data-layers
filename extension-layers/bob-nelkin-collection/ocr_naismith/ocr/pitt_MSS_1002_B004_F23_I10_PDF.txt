State Welfare chief in error at Polk .
West Middlesex, Pa.
Editor, The Herald
As parents of a resident of Polk State School and Hospital, we wish to express our concern and complete disapproval in the dismissal of Dr. J.H. McClelland as superintendent and of the critical statements made by other parties.
When statements such as those in Wednesday’s Herald edition concerning patients reach the public’s eye, the community in general tend to laud the action taken. When a person like myself reads the same statements. I feel there is injustice being done. Polk State School and Hospital ranks as one of the most proficient and well kept schools in our state under the leadership of Dr. McClelland. I have had the opportunity to visit various institutions both in Ohio and Pennsylvania and can truthfully boast the Polk State School is well ahead in innovations towards the retarded child.
We are refuting Mrs. Wohlgemuth's statement that Dr. McClelland permitted, (1) cruel, degrading and inhumane conditions and. (2) severe and chronic deficiencies with respect to proper training and orientation of professional and non-professional staff in the appropriate cases of the
mentally retarded residents of Polk.
May we take a quote from Mrs. Wohlgemuth? When asked how she would have handled the situation, she said. "I have never operated an Institution." What kind of answer is this from a state welfare representative? She keeps expounding on the overcrowded and understaffed conditions at the institution, so why not work on something that is constructive instead of dismissing Dr. McClelland? We feel this is a political move, and it’s a shame that tfye retarded person will be affected by such, with the dismissal of Dr. McClelland.
The public must be made aware of the fact that there are people in our world who are less fortunate than us and must be cared for all their lives. Polk State School exercises the very best methods in caring for these people. There is an underlying factor that has triggered this dismissal and the public should be given the total facts before any decision is made.
Mrs. Wohlgemuth, through her actions, displayed a complete lack of knowledge in the proper health, education and welfare of the 2,831 residents at Polk State School and Hospital. Also, we believe a public apology should be made by Mrs. Wohlgemuth to Dr. McClelland.
Mr. and Mrs. Erank Vellente
