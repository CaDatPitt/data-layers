Dr. Ruth Scott, Superintendent Western State School and Hospital
333 Curry Hill Road Canonsburg, Pa. 15317
Dear Dr. Scott:
ACC-PARC received a call from a concerned WSSH parent. The complaint was that the parent is not’ notified when the resident is injured. When the parent visits, neither nurse nor attendant informs , the parent of the injury.	*
What is Western State School and Hospital’s	„•
policy on the notification of parents when their son or daughter is injured?
In 1973, a committee consisting of parents and professionals, appointed by the Regional Office, composed a Bill of Rights for DPW facilities. Article I, Section F reads:
"You will be informed as soon as possible of any illness or accident that requires the service of a nurse or doctor. In the event an illness or accident occurs to your child you may have your child seen by the physician of your choice at your expense.”

We hope that this section of the Bill of Rights will be adopted as WSSH’s policy, if no similar provision exists.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin
