FROM: BOB NELKIN
RE: RIGHT TO EDUCATION IN STATE INSTITUTIONS AND INTERIM CARE FACILITIES
At a recent Harrisburg meeting, the Right to Education Masters stated: it is apparent that there has been a substantial failure on the part of both the Departments of Education and Welfare to comply with the court order with regard to this (institutional) population.
1.	The Masters ruled, concerning school-age individuals in state institutions:	Individuals up to age 21, not currently receiving a program,
shall be evaluated and placed in programs of education and training appropriate to their needs by January 2, 1973.
2.	The Masters ruled, concerning school-age Individuals in our state institutions: Children currently receiving programs shall be re-evaluated and, if needed, changed to a program appropriate to his/her needs by March I, 1973.
3.	The Masters ruled, concerning school-age children in private licensed
facilities:	It Is equally clear the court order extends to these
children. Therefore, the Secretary of Welfare and the Secretary of Education shall locate, evaluate and provide appropriate instruction for these individuals as well.
As members of the Committee know well, Right to Education has not found the state schools and hospitals. For example, at Western State the plan of the institution was to increase the teaching staff by 15 special education teachers. Although this was woefully inadequate, WSSH has not even received one of the 15 teachers.
Yet to be clarified is what constitutes appropriate education for children in institutions. Some children receive programs one hour a day, one day a week, some for 3 hours per week and others 5 hours per day for 5 days per week. No standard has yet been devised by the State authorities.
