Dear Mr. Nelkin:
In the two years that our group has been in existence, we have learned of the many difficulties that Mr. Wittman faces trying to get the government to make necessary improvements to Southwest Habilitation Center.
Recently it has been brought to our attention that a much needed third floor behavior care unit is needed for those residents that require constant supervision. As a group we have written letters to Mr. Beal, Mr. Jenkins and Mrs. Calloway expressing our desire to see this unit opened, but have received no other response than that the matter is under consideration.
It has recently come to the attention of our group that there are several residents who are posing a real problem for the workers at the center. I was informed last week about an incident where one of the residents, in a fit of anger, literally ripped a door of its hinges and where another resident started a fight and hit another tesident. We are afraid that serious physical harm may come to our relatives if these few are allowed to remain at Southwest Habilitation Center.
I am soliciting your help in possibly advising us what action our group should take to demand that either the third floor be opened to house these residents or that they be transferred someplace where they can be properly cared for.
Our next meeting will be on Sunday, August 8th at 3:00 at the Center and I am requesting that you attend. If you are unable to make the meeting, perhaps you could get in touch with me and give me some help. My home phone number is 486-2643.
Very truly yours
Joseph S. Fodi
