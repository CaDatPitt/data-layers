Dear Chuck:
In thinking over our meeting of the afternoon of March 1, it seemed to me that it would be in everyone’s interest if I would put in writing my understanding of the agreements reached in our discussion# Please let me know if your understanding differs from mine on any point o
1.	Western State School and Hospital recognizes the legitimacy of the Allegheny County Chapter’s role as an advocate for residents of WSSH and/or their parents or guardians# It was agreed, however, that WSSH must, for its protection, require a statement signed by the parent or guardian indicating that the Allegheny County Chapter has been authorized by the parent or guardian to act for them. It was also agreed that the Allegheny County Chapter would assume responsibility for obtaining the statement and seeing to it that it was in the hands of VJSSH before seeing a resident# In addition, WSSH requested (not required) that the Allegheny County Chapter encourage the parent or guardian to inform WSSH of the nature of their concern or complaint.
2.	It was agreed that in all instances, excepting cases of alleged abuse, which will be discussed below, the Allegheny County Chapter will give the Social Worker responsible for the resident reasonable notice of their intension to visit a resident. In the event that the Social Worker or his supervisor is not available, the Allegheny County Chapter may contact the Superintendent’s office.
3.	It was felt that in cases of alleged abuse of a resident the circumstances, perhaps, warrant an unannounced visit. It was agreed that if the Joint Visitation is made permanent, however, the Allegheny County Chapter will work within the Visitation Team structure. It was agreed that at the next Liaison Committee meeting (scheduled for March 27, 1973 at 6:30 p.m.) the

need for a procedure that would expedite arrangements for an unannounced visit in the case of alleged abuse would be discussed <» The March 2? meeting of the Liaison Committee has been called for the purpose of discussing the first unannounced visit and to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees and Parents Group.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Hiltner Superintendent
