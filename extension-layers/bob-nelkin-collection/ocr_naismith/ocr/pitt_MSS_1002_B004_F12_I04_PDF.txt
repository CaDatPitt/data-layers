Considering that the subject of telephone conversations this school and members of their families was pretty well explored during our telephone conversation of the morning of September 23, 1972, I have had difficulty per-suading myself that written response about it was owing. Finally, however, I have considered that you do deserve an answer as you indicated, and so here it is.
First let me say I realize full well that free access to established methods of communication between residents of a place like this and their families is a matter of much importance and concern in today's world.

Insofar as your particular situation is concerned, however, I am willing upon telephone notice from you or your secretary to me to arrange for Nancy to make a return call to you through the pay phone in our lobby with the help of one of the employes assigned to her cottage in the same manner as was done last September. I have no objection to so doing, and will be pleased to do so whenever the request is made. I trust that this solution will prove to be of satisfaction to you. It is the best that I can offer at this time.
