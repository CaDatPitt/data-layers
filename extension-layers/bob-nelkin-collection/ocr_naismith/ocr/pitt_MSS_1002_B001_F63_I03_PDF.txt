Stan Stein opened the meeting by introducing our guests and asking others to introduce themselves and the organization they represent.
City of Pittsburgh and their stand on S.B. 9^
Ray Reaves gave a summary of the work of the City Planning Department on the zoning of Community Living Facilities and the failure of the City to adapt amendments for these facilities.
Ben Hayllar stated that the City of Pittsburgh had taken a stand against S.B. 9^. He identified the following concerns: state over riding local zoning laws, delinquents, and impact of facilities in the City.
Tom Halloran, Bob Nelkin, and others responded to these areas of concern. It was explained that local zoning laws have discriminated against Community Living Facilities, that the state legislators gave the right to govern local zoning to the local municipalities, that delinquents are not covered in S.B. 9*+, and that it is to the advantage of the City to have S.B. 9^ past so that Community Living Facilities could be developed outside the City limits.
After some discussion, Mr. Hayllar stated that he believed the City would be willing to re-evaluate their position on S.B. 9^+. Stan asked that 1 or 2 representatives from the Task Force meet with those responsible in the Mayor's office to further discuss their concerns and explain the need for S.B. 9^- Mr. Hayllar advised that he would call Sue Brownlee, staff person, after talking to the appropriate people in the Mayor’s Office.
Ray Reaves then asked about specific sections of the Bill. Tom Halloran and others responded.
Strategy
After our guests from the City left, those present made a list of various supporting organizations having conferences in the Fall. They will he contacted in regards to their taking that opportunity to organize their members behind S.B. 9^ or if the meeting is with legislators, to push S.B. 9U.
We will ask Senator Nolan that the Conference Committee not report the Bill out of Conference until after the general election at which time it will be voted on by both Houses.
All organizations will be asked to push S.B. 9^ after the November general election .
