Dear Sir:
As architects and engineers and as concerned citizens* we are requesting that you use the Influence of your office to permit the use of conventional or Type 6 construction for Residential Care Facilities for retarded adults.
We think that a well built residence, duplex* or triplex would be the proper type of building for these people. We wish to stay away from the Institutional type of building and we want the residential character. By well built residence we mean masonry or even siding exterior* wood studs and joists* with plaster finish, wood stairs with plaster soffits, and conventional windows and doors.
By definition, this Is a residence for a rather special group of people. They are special only 1n that they are different from the majority. They are entitled to home like surroundings and 1t 1s our feeling that they can get this best 1n an existing residence.
Very truly yours.
Louis W. Re 14
