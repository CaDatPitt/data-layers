Dear Mr. Buchanan:
Thank you for your letter of April h, 1^75, indicating the Pennsylvania Association for Retar led Citizens’ response to the "Modular Unit Plan," submitted by Mr. Harry Herman, Superintendent of fbensubrg State School end Hospital. As you indicated, there are tvo separate issues discussed and I vill respond to both.
Upon reviewing the proposed plan, and the subsequent justification by Hr. Androv Vaveris, it is my opinion that there is no evidence of planned ’'permanence.” The proy.osal clearly states that "the overall goal of the transition services would be to gradually expose and train the students in handling situations they encounter In subsequent community class placements.” The utilization of the units in this manner la not contrary to the ultimate goal of community integration sun-ported by both the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens and this Department. The fact that 350 students presently attend classes at the Fben3burg Borough School indicates our determination to seek this integration. The proposed utilization of the Vinco Elementary School in September by an additional 150 students further emphasizes our commitment.
While the Department does not sunport the arbitrary placement of the demountable units on the grounds 01 ..very State School and Hospital, it will individually support, their development when the investigation of all other options are clearly documented re unacceptable. I concur with the State Task Force’s nogitlon that the most desirable class placement for all mentally retarded children is vithin the regular elementary or secondary” school building. I also, however, share the viewpoint of Secretary Plttenger, expressed in his memorandum of A.nril 8, 1975, to the Task Force Committee that ve cannot unilaterally exclude other options, even though they are le33 desirable. The Department of Public Welfare vill support the placement of demountable units at a State School and Kosnital when 1) all other, more acceptable community options have been investigated, determined to be

unacceptable and documented, and/or 2) in the opinion of a staff physician, it is not medically advisable for a student to attend educational classes off-grounda. In both instances, the demountable units provide a viable, temporary alternative to the ’’basement classrooms” presently characteristic in our State Schools and Hospitals.
The need to utilize the units at Ebensburg State School and Hospital has not been determined to date. I have requested Mr. Herman and Mr. Robert Vogt, the Central Regional Commissioner for Mental Retardation, to investigate the present and projected educational situation. Their recommendations and Justifications will be forwarded to me for my review. Based upon this review, I will make a decision relative to placement of the Units.
The second issue of providing educational services to those residents over 21 years of age is a major concern of this Denartment. The increasing number of residents reaching this age requires that additional educational opportunities and appropriate snace be explored and provided. This mist occur if we are to continue to meet the educational, developmental goals of the individual. I am suggesting that representatives from both the Office of Mental Retardation and the State School and Hosnital Superintendents meet, at the earliest possible tine, with renresentatives from the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens to discuss this situation. The development of a plan of action with appropriate implementation delineated, is a matter of great concern.
Thank you for your expressed concerns and please be assured that I share your desire to provide quality educational services to all of the residents of our State Schools and Hospitals.
Very truly yours,
Frank S. Beal
