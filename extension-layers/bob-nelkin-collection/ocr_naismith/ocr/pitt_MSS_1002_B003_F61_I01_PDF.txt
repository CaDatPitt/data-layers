p.m. to 8
More than a month after Mr. P^M was first placed in isolation, he was read his "rights” by Robert^^er, Ph.D., at which time Mr.	requested to see a lawyer. On July 24, 197£^a lawyer
from a^TAmerican Civil Liberties Union visited Mr. pHH and agreed on behalf of the ACLU, to represent him in hi^erforts to obtain an immediate release from his solitary confinement and to obtain a more habilitative program.
Mr. nBs medical records reveal that his eight-week isolation is at the direction of the Superintendent of Western Center.
When this situation was brought to the Superintendent’s attention, she indicated that Mr.	s status would continue unaltered
until he is transferred to a more appropriate facility.
The Legal Committee of the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the ACLU has authorized that all appropriate steps be taken to vindicate Mr.	in this egregious violation of his constitutional and
statutory rights. Although we are prepared to take legal action to resolve this matter, we presume that our goal of obtaining a more habilitative environment for Mr.	is consistent with
