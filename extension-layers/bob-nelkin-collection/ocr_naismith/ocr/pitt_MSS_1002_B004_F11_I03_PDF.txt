Dear Norman:
•Relative to our conversation in California^ attached are the Adfnission Policies and Procedures which we are attempting to initiate at Polk State School.
There are dozens of other problems related to the MH/MR Act5 but I think admission policies and procedures somehow ought to be legislated so that the institutional program becomes a relevant resource of program opportunity in the life span of those retarded who may need it. I would be most happy to work with you and anyone else in further developing this.
Best personal regards.

AHilSSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
AtT'
1. AH referrals to Polk State School are to be made through the''" MH/MR Base Service Unit.
2. Each referral must be accompanied by as much recent medical, psychological, social, educational and behavioral data as possible.	/
3* Each referral must state the problem which necessitates the Belerra^ of the retarded person from his home or community, and what behavioral, medical or social factors precipitated this request.
All alternative community resources or programs should be explored (such as foster home, group home, etc.) before requests for admission be made®
Each request for admission must be accompanied by a goal specific request for services which will fit the needs of the referred retarded individual o This request for goal specific services will then be jointly planned with Polk State School staff to determine a timetable and program to meet these goals. This timetable will also state what action or direction will be taken when the goals are accomplished (such as return home, placement in a foster home, group home, etc.).	«
All admissions will be for a specified period of time (no longer than six months) renewable until the specified goals are achieved.
6o The referral source, parents,and when practical the referred retardate must be given the opportunity to view and observe the residential unit where the retarded individual will live and the program areas in which the individual will be programmed in before any admission plan is finalized.
