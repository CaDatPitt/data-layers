Proposed Plan For Dental Service Reviews
Background:
The Department of Public Welfare and the Office of Mental .Retardation are committed to providing all of the professional and professional support services required to meet the individual needs of the mentally retarded residents of our State Centers. One such service is the provision of appropriate dental care.
In recent months, a great deal of emphasis has been directed toward the review of the dental services at two of our State Centers - Ebensburg and Cresson. These reviews, while emphasizing specific problems at these two facilities, also indicated the importance of completing similar reviews at all of the remaining State Centers.
The following discussion addresses the issues related to these expanded reviews.
Facility Priorities:
The Office of Mental Retardation is recommending a prioritization of the State Centers to be reviewed. These priorities are established primarily on the size of the facility (the largest being reviewed first), on prior ’’commitments”, (Selinsgrove has been previously indicated as the facility to be reviewed after Cresson and Ebensburg) and on the size of the dental staffs to be reviewed. Our recommended priorities are as follows:
1.	Selinsgrove Center
2.	Pennhurst Center
3.	Polk Center
4.	Hamburg Center
5.	White Haven Center
6.	Embreeville State Hospital
7.	Western Center
8.	Marcy State Hospital
9.	Laurelton Center
10.	Woodhaven Center
Time Frame For Completion:
It is believed that a period of approximately two days will be required to adequately complete dental reviews at each facility. Additionally, we feel that approximately three weeks will be required to complete the written report and to present it for review to the facility, the appropriate Regional Office and the Central Office. These time frames are primarily based on the experience of the review teams which completed the reports at Cresson and Ebensburg Centers.

With these time frames in mind, the following tentative schedule is proposed for the completion of the reviews at all of the State Centers:
Review Dates		Completion of Report/ Review of Report
Selinsgrove	March 1, 2, 1979	March 23, 1979
Pennhurst	March 29, 30, 1979	April 20, 1979
Polk	April 26, 27, 1979	May 18, 1979
1 Hamburg	May 24, 25, 1979	June 15, 1979
White Haven	June 21, 22, 1979	July 13, 1979
Embreeville	July 19, 20, 1979	August 10, 1979
Western	August 16, 17, 1979	September 7, 1979
Marcy	September 13, 14, 1979 October 5, 1979	
' Laurelton	October 11, 12, 1979	November 2, 1979
Woodhaven 1	November 8, 9, 1979	November 30, 1979 1
This schedule would allow us to complete all facility reviews by the end of this calendar year. It is, however, a schedule which will require a major time commitment of the review team members and the appropriate staff of this Department.
D. Composition of the Review Team:
There are apparently two approaches which could be pursued in developing the team or teams necessary to complete the dental reviews. The first would actively enlist the resources of the Department of Health while the second would be a team developed by the Department of Public Welfare without specific involvement of the Department of Health. To some extent, therefore, the composition of the teams and the Department primarily responsible for their formation and direction is related to the support which the Department of Health can and will supply.
In either of the above options, the teams should:
1.	Be comprised of either 3 or 4 dentists (depending on the size of the facility).
2.	Be comprised of dentists who have professional training and/or experience in providing direct dental services to developmentally disabled persons.
Some persons from Pennsylvania who would be acceptable team members are:
1.	Dr. Jay Reznik
Monaca, Pennsylvania and dentist at Western Center
2.	Dr. Mamoun Nazif
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
3.	Dr. George Bentz
University of Pittsburgh, Department of Pedodontics, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

4.	Dr. Manny Album
Jenkintown, Pennsylvania
In addition, Dr. Larry Caffee, Executive Director of the National Foundation of Dentistry for the Handicapped,, has indicated that several dentists from outside Pennsylvania are also willing to participate in dental reviews. These are:
1.	Dr. Saul Karmen
Jamaca, New York
2.	Dr. Robert Kaplan
Cherry Hill, New Jersey
3.	Dr. Lewis Kay
Haddonfield, New Jersey
4.	Dr. Joseph O'Donnell
Waltham, Massachusetts
These eight (8) dentists have the prequisite skills to perform the necessary dental reviews at the State Centers. Other dentists, not listed, may also be identified as we finalize the review plans. If the Department of Health is involved, a dentist from their Bureau of Dental Services will probably be involved as a team member as well.
E. Proposed Monitoring System:
The successful implementation of a Statewide dental review program will depend to a great extent on the Department's overall ability to monitor the reviews and to assess the resultant recommendations for further action. The following comments relate to the establishment of a suggested monitoring/review process:
1.	The selected survey team members (at least a week prior to each facility visit) should be provided with any and all pertinent background information regarding dental services. Such information should include, but not necessarily be limited to, previous review reports, staffing patterns, names of dental staff, names of key facility administrative staff and a profile of the resident population.
2.	The Department’s principle point of contact with the review team at each facility should be the appropriate Regional Commissioner of Mental Retardation . A person within the Office of Mental Retardation, however, should be designated as the overall coordinator for the reviews. This person would work cooperatively with the Regional Commissioner to see that the reviews occur on schedule.
3.	After each on-site review is completed, the team
will have three weeks in which to complete their report. At the end of this time, a meeting will be held in Harrisburg to review the report and to meet personally with the review team members. This meeting should include appropriate staff from the reviewed facility, the responsible Regional Office, the Office of Mental Retardation, as well as representation from the Secretary's Office.	\
4.	After the above meeting, staff from the facility, the Region and the Office of Mental Retardation will review each team finding. A recommendation on each item will be developed and forwarded to the Secretary for further review and approval. Each supportable recommendation will include cost estimates, if appropriate, a time frame for implementation, and
the person(s) responsible for the implementation.
If the team recommendation is not supportable, a statement as why will also be presented to the Secretary.
5.	With the Secretary's approval, the appropriate team recommendations will be implemented at each facility surveyed.
6.	Quarterly updates on all implemented recommendations will be provided to the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation by the responsible Regional Office. This status report will also list any difficulties in the implementation of any recommendation and will propose any additional action which may be necessary to provide quality dental services.
Additional Comments:
1.	Consideration should be given to the hiring of a dentist within the Office of Mental Retardation. Such a professional could assure direct monitoring of all reviews and could participate as a member of all teams.
2.	A cost of up to $300/day may be required for each dentist outside of State employment participating on the review teams. Depending on the length of the survey and the time , needed to complete the report, the cost per dentist, per survey could oe $900-$1200. A four person team could cost approximately $4800 for each survey completed. The ten surveys could cost a maximum of $48,000. A reduction in this cost could be achieved if...

a.	Some of the review team dentists are State employees
b.	The Department of Health assumes primary responsibility for the reviews and, therefore, some (if not all)
of the responsibility of the costs.
c.	Dentists on the team will accept less money.
d.	The team is comprised of three, rather than four members.
e.	The team does not complete reviews at all facilities.
3.	A decision as to the role of the Department of Health is of primary concern. Previous discussions asked them to ’’act on our behalf". Selection of team members, the schedule for reviews and payments can only be finalized when their role is determined.
4.	The comments contained in this report are those of the Office of Mental Retardation. There was not sufficient time to have any of the six sections reviewed by the Regional Offices.
