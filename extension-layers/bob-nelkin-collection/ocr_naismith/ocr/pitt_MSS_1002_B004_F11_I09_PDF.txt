Mrs. Norbert J. Welkers 5474 Fair Oaks Street Pittsburgh, Pa. 15217
Dear Mrs. Welkers:
Your reply to Mrs. Jean Dawson has been given to me for response. We are not surprised that you are distressed with the adverse publicity concerning Polk State School and Hospital. All of us who know the Institution are distressed.
Conversely, you should note that this chapter was not consulted by either the Department of Public Welfare or Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children before action was taken. You might also note that the State President, Mrs. Pat Clapp, has publicly stated that PARC did not call for the Superintendent’s resignation.
For your Information, I am enclosing a newspaper report that endeavors to put the unfortunate Polk State School and Hospital situation Into perspective.
We sincerely hope you will reconsider your decision. However, In a matter such as this, one’s conscience must dictate how they behave. In any event, we truly appreciate your previous service as a "Call of Hope" marcher.
Best personal wishes,
C. A. Peters Executive Director
