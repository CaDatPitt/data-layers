Dear Governor Shapp:
I have learned about the dismissal of Dr. James II. McClelland, Jr., as
superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital from our local newspaper and from our local Affiliate in the area of the institution. From my per* eonal knowledge about Polk State School and Hospital and our local Affi* liate*s collaboration with officials of the institution over a long period of time, we protest the autocratic manner of Dr. McClelland*s dismissal.
I urge you to make an immediate investigation into the situation which, from information thus far received, appears to be a very hasty and unfair
decision.
Sincerely yours,
Hugh W. Ransom Executive Director
HWR/dls
