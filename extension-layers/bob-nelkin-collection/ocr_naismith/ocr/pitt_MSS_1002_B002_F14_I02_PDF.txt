Dear Dr. Atwater:
Thank you for your letter of May 19, 1981.
Since your organization meets regularly with Dr. Jennifer Howse, Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation, I do not feel the need to follow your suggestions to meet regularly with PARC. However, we will be calling a meeting of interested and affected groups on zoning legislation and'will be happy to include you. In the Fall, we will be setting budget priorities for 1982-83 and will hold a meeting with interested groups as we did last year; once again, PARC will be invi ted.
May I remind you that the Department welcomes constructive citizen review of its programs and has worked with the ARCs to effect this review. We do not condone, however, unannounced citizen visitations to private providers of mental retardation services, when those visits are not welcomed by the providers. It is then that monitoring becomes trespassing.
I suggest that you contact the Office of Mental Retardation directly with regard to planning for community services. The planning requirements and review of county plans are handled by that office.
Your views on the ARC‘s support to date of the Department's effort do not coincide with mine. In fact, your views of the ARC'S activities in the Pennhurst 1itigation, of the Department's progress in developing community alternatives and of your characterization of my remarks before the appropriation committees are classic delusionary and self-serving exercises. They deserve no further comment.
P.O. Box 2675, Harrisburg. PA 17120
Elton Atwater, Ed.D.
Dr. Howse is available to work with the ARC to develop an agenda, if you feel that an occasional meeting with the ARC leadership would be helpful.
Sincerely
Helen B. O'Bannon
