PROGRAM STATEMENT
The Community Living Arrangements program was initiated in 1971-72 in order to enable mentally retarded individuals to live in a non-institutional community setting and to prepare them for independent or family living. The CLA Program provides nine different types of community based residential services as alternatives to institutionalization for the mentally retarded citizen. Several CLA’s serve specific target groups, such as children, youth, and adults. Other types are based on medical, correctional, behavioral shaping, and respite care modes.
By June 30, 1976, an estimated 3,574- persons will be served since the initiation of the CLA Program. Of this number, 2,185 will be residing in CLA settings and an additional 1,389 people will have moved from CLA’s into independent or family settings or to State Schools or Nursing Homes. (Schedule 1) Approximately 54% of the persons residing in CLA’s were previous residents of State institutions.
During the 1974-75 fiscal year, 1,950 persons were served in the CLA Program. Of this number, 1,605 were residing in CLA settings and 345 were dispersed to independent or family settings or to State Schools or Nursing Homes. For the 1975-76 fiscal year, it is estimated that 2,764 persons will be served in the CLA Program. Of this number, it is estimated that 2,185 will be residing in CLA settings at the end of FY 1975-76, and 579 persons will have been dispersed to independent or family living settings or to State Schools or Nursing Homes.
The Governor’s Recommended Budget provides for continued funding for the estimated 2,185 persons in residence in the CLA’s with an 8% cost of living increase for FY 1976-77. This projects an estimated average cost per person oi $17.88. The budget also provides for the phase-in during the year of 553 additional residents to the prog-ram.
