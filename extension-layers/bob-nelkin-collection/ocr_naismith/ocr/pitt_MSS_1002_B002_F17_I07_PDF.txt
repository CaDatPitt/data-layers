What action should the Commonwealth take In response to the April 26, 1979 Federal Court Order?
Decision needed immediately so attorneys can follow through.
The April 26th Court Order provides services to Pennhurst employees to help them find alternate employment. The Order also includes the "Projected Movement of Pennhurst Center Employees."
Issue:
Requested Action Date:
Background:
A decision is necessary if we want to appeal, stay, modify, or implement this Order.
Alternatives:
Option A:	Appeal the Order
Option B:	Appeal the Order and seek a stay
Option C:	Seek modifications of Court Order
Option D:	Take no legal action and implement Order
Discussion:
The Commonwealth is concerned for the future of Pennhurst Center’s employees who will probably lose their jobs if the Court Orders are implemented. The Commonwealth agrees that assistance should be provided to these employees.
Page 2
The Commonwealth does not agree to some of the specific elements and arrangements.
The Commonwealth agrees that the residents should be moved from Pennhurst Center to the community. The Commonwealth does not agree to the schedule of movement "projected" in this Order.
A decision to appeal (A or B) indicates that the Commonwealth is opposed to services to employees who will lose their jobs and opposed to moving residents from Pennhurst to the community.
Our real interest now is to change the Order (C) so that it’s workable. If the schedulezof movements is not possible, let’s propose an alternate schedule. Likewise, let’s propose every change that the Commonwealth wants to be made in this Court Order.
The course of "no legal action and implementation of Order" (D) should be followed if we have no major disagreements, or if there is little likelihood that we will prevail in our arguments.
Recommendat ions:
1)	(Option C) - The Commonwealth should seek to modify the April 26, 1979 Court Order so that it is possible to implement.
2)	Propose to modify as detailed on Attachment A.
Approve:

Attachment A
April 26, 1979 Court Order
Halderman v. Pennhurst
Commonwealth Proposed Changes:
1.	Page 14 — change from 115 to 52 the number of residents to be moved
by June 30, 1979.
The Court’s projection was based on DPW’s Pennhurst Dispersal Plan, which was subsequently abandoned by the Secretary on March 20, 1979. According to DPW’s current plans, 52 Pennhurst residents are scheduled to move to the community between Inarch 1st and June 30th.
2.	Reduce the "projected" rate (100 residents every three months) of movement from Pennhurst to the community.
Office of Mental Retardation projects, based on past experience, that two to ten persons can be moved into the community each month. The average movement over the last 21 months has been six persons from Pennhurst a month. (Western Region, with far less population, has moved an average of 38 persons into the community each month. Southeast Region has moved an average of 18 persons a month into CLA’s over the last two years). A compromise acceptable to the Court, plaintiffs, and defendants should be sought of between six and 33 residents moving each month.
3.	Clarify that the movement of residents (Page 14) will occur only after the previously-ordered projections and procedures (i.e. Individual Habilitation Plans, etc.) are accomplished. This will insure that the "projected movement" is a goal and not an order. This statement will clarify that this is not a wholesale "dumping" of Pennhurst residents.
4.	Delete the term "will be laid off" from Page 12. Replace with the term, "may no longer be needed."
The Federal Court should allow the Commonwealth flexibility to employ Pennhurst employees in accordance with Commonwealth needs, laws, regulations, and agreements. Since the Court’s primary interest is the welfare of Pennhurst residents, the Court should allow the Commonwealth freedom in administrative areas. Perhaps DPW might transfer employees or reduce hours, rather than lay off employees.
5.	Page 6 — A maximum amount of "state payment of education tuition and training costs" to be expended per employee and total for all employees should be stated.
Irv Rosenstein, the Director of the Office of Employee Services, set a cap for tuition payment at $45,000 per year for three years. (Figured at
Attachment A
Page 2
75 employees x $600). The individual employee is allowed one year of tuition at a maximum of $1,000 or 12 college credits. Since this set of maximums exists and is an alternative to unlimited costs of retraining, these limits should be added to the Order.
6.	Add a provision which continues and guarantees the Commonwealth's Rights as Employers. At the Court hearing on this plan, Judge Broderick said he would include such a provision. The Judge failed to include this provision. Coupled with Court-ordered continuation of current labor agreements, this provision will reduce disruption of current personnel practices.
