Bear Mrs. Wohlgemuth,
I am writing this letter as the mother of a mentally retarded child in a state school.
We had to place our child in a state school.
We were unable to manage her. We felt so helpless placing her in the state school.
It was like a nightmare, and another nightmare to live with her.
For the first time since we have placed her at the state school. 1 feel hope.
Thank you for the fantastic job you are doing.
We, think you are wonderful.
The time has come for change.
Violet
