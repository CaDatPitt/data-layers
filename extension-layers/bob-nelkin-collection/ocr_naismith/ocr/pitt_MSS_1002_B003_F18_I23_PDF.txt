Dear Norman:
Thank you for meeting with members of the Parents Droup of Western .State and with the ACC-&RC concerning the closing of admissions at western State.
As wa discussed at our meeting, «e feel that ths Department, by closing admissions, would admit to the dangerous situation that exists at western due to under-staffing and overcrowding. Such blatant disregarding of overcrowded conditions by allowing placements to continue to be made indicates to parents that the drowning of u resident and the severe recent beating of ano.her (in addition to the daily assaults made on each other and on staff) is of little or no concern to the Department. We are therefore wondering what must happen next at Western to casks Region and the Department become interested enough a serious position.
star t h e c-
the
to take
We are disappointed in your position also because it, by continuing to allow placements to be made, puts no pressure on 3»se service Units or any Department to find alternative residential facilities for wnioh there is great urgency.
lour offer to accompany the group on an unannounced visit at any time but stating in advance that it would not change your position was indeed a devastating statement. To say chit nothing that happens or nothing you nee can change your mind la beyond our comprehension. Ae ware also dismayed to learn that while private licensed facilities have standards which the Regional Office is making them live up to, stats facilities nave no standards to be met and you intend to do nothing abou t it.
?rankly, we came away from our meeting with you pretty well convinced that not even the death of a resident due to lack of staff Is ping to make the regional office offer more than a token siring of a few more aides. «e only hope tnat Secretary Wohlgemuth will care more deeply than your office appears to do so.
olacerely yours,
Harrz L. Goldber*. C. D.
