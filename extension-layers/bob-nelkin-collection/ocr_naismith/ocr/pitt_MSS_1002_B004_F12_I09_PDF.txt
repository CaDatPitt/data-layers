Dear Norm:
I am enclosing for your edification, and for whatever other use you can make of it, a poignant letter I received from one of our listeners. It seems to me the gentleman makes a good case.
The more I think of this complaint, the less reason I can find for the complete lack of...not only telephones... a complete and efficient communications center at POlk.
Dammitall, Norm, I'm getting sick and tired of this shit. The patients at Polk are not prisoners. Or are .they? Why the second-class schtick about no phones?
Ya know, the more I think about it, the more convinced I become that recipients and/or victims of all types of state aid need an ombudsman; and £ nominate you.
Kidding aside, can you relay this one off Norm Taylor and ask him to move fast on it? I think he’ll listen to you!
