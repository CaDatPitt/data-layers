HARRISBURG—The association of State Mental Hospital Physician’s has called for the reinstatement of Dr. Janies McClelland as superintendent of the Polk State School and
•	Hospital.
Meanwhile Welfare Secretary Helen Wohlgemuth issued an order banning the use of “locked cages or pens” for the incarceration of residents” at all other state institutions
•	under her control or supervision. These institutions house some 40.000 residents.
The use of five feet by five
•	feet by five feet pens at Polk led to the firing last week of Dr. McClelland. Mrs. Wohlgemuth said she first saw the pens in use at Polk during a surprise visit to the Venango County institution April 14.
The mental hospital phj’si-cians adopted a resolution supporting Dr. McCelland at a meeting here. The organization asked for a “complete impartial investigation of the case.”
THE RESOLUTION, sent to Gov. Shapp, said the charges
that Dr. McCelland permitted “cruel, degrading and inhumane conditons at Polk are defaming of his known character, his personal and professional integrity, his well documented actions in his love and care of the retarded patients, and are in fact without sub-s rance.”
The resolutfoif*1 was _______
auced by Dr. Albert G. Roodc of the Polk staff. It was passed unanimously.
In her directive to top welfare department o f f i c i a Is, Mrs. Wohlgemuth said she did not want the pens used in any institutions for which the department has operational, licensing, approval or supervisory powers.

Wohlgemuth Acted
» Too Hastily at Polk
I was disturbed by the hasty action on the part of Mrs. Wohlgemuth in dismissing Dr. James McClelland, Superin-
< tendent of Polk Institute, from ■ a post that he has held for 15 years.
There may be areas in . which the care of the patients could be improved. However,, it would seem to me that one visit by Mrs. Wohlgemuth is scarcely enough to warrant 1 such an upheaval. ; Care of the very retarded is
a very specialized procedure. 1 Might I suggest that Mrs. . Wohlgemuth spend one week ‘as an attendant in the ward , for very retarded persons before she makes such an important decision.	j
