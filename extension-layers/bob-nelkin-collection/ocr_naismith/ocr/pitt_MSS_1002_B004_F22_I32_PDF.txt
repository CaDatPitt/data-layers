Dear Governor Shapp,
APR 2 31973 You have my support in the following:	£ - , -	(C.,^
(1)	advocacy of the graduated income tax
(2)	relief for the elderly	fo.....
(3)	public assistance refora
(4)	reform in the fields of insurance, milk price control, etc.
(5)	recognition of the fact that morality cannot be legislated, and opposition to the inhumane abortion passed by the Assembly
(6)	attempts to provide education for and humane treatment of the mentally retarded.
On the other hand, I heartily disapprove of the methods employed by the Secretary of Welfare to displace Dr. James McClelland as superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital.
I do not advocate the medical model. Anyone with a claim to humanity must favor the rehabilitative model. Given tho overcrowded conditions which have existed at Polk almost since its opening, the medical model was the only way to ensure the Physical health and well-being of the residents. As a medical model, Poll: has performed well, as attested by the increased life expectancy of its population.
Regarding cruel and inhumane treatment, I an sure that "restraints" have been used more than they should be in some cases, but the PARC inspectors and Ms. Wolgemuth have failed to seriously investigate the "why" of such restraints. "Fighting" may sound relatively trivial as a reason, but I have seen the results of tho "fighting" of aggressive residents- broken bones, cuts requiring stitches, missing earlobes, etc. I have personally disengaged the hands of a young male resident who ror no apparent reason attacked another resident who is extremely passive and offered no resistance to the attempted strangulation. Volumes could be written to document the reasons for restraints and/or tranquillizers.
The charge of inhumane treatment leveled against Dr. McClelland i3 particularly abhorrent and libelous to anyone who has worked under him. He has always had an "open door" policy to the residents in his charge.He has encouraged and supported urograms for all residents. His major crime in today’s society is the result of his empathy with both retardates and their families. In trying to relieve the pressures put on such families and to protect the retardates from the indifference and/or cruelty of the community in general, he has perpetuated the need for the medical model. He doos not deserve to be labeled inhumane.
I believe that you are a decent man, sincerely trying to effect social reform. In the name of decency, please do r.ot allow the stain of these charges to stand on another decent man’s record.
Respectfully,
Barbara Watkins, Education Dept.,
