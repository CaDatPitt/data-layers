Dear Hr. Duffy:
This is in response to the third step grievance filed
by AFSCME* on behalf of a group of Chilu Care Aides at Polk State School and hospital.
The grievance alleges that Mana. en.ent has violated
Article XXXVIII of our current agreement by permitting parents to come into resident’s living area and change their children’s clothing. The Union recocriends tnat parents should not be allowed on the wards unles3 accompanied by a supervisor end should be prohibited iron cressing or unartssing their children.
The second and first step answers to this grievance
indicate that the hospital will make every effort to have a supervisor accompany parents who wish to visit the wards.
Apparently, the Union nas continued this appeal,
because it wished to restrict tne rigats of the pare: rs to visit and dress and undress their own cailureu on the grounds that this activity is a threat to the health and safety of the parents, children and/or employes of folk. The Departtiont of Public Welfare cannot agree witn sucn an assertion. It is the policy of this Departrueiit to respect the rights of employes, patients, and parents of residents. These parents’ rights include the right to visit and help care for their children, if they so desire.
We can see no violation of the contract in such a policy. Accordingly, this grievance is denied.
Sincerely your3.
