REQUEST FOR COVERAGE
EVENT:	4 Opportunity to interview Dr. Frank Menolascino, President of the National Association for Retarded Citizens.	(NARC headquarters are in Texas; Dr. Menolascino is a resident of Nebraska.)
DATE:	Friday, November 5, 1976
TIME:	Dr. Menolascino will be available for interviews fjrom 2:30 to 5:00 P.M.
PLACE:	Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic, 3811 O'Hara St., Pgh., Pa. 15261. He is speaking on the subject of "Psychiatric Challenges in the Diagnosis and Management of the Mentally Retarded" during the morning session.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:	Dr. Menolascino will receive the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital Award in recognition of his achievements and leadership in the field of mental retardation. The award will be presented next Monday, November 8.	(See enclosed clipping.) r We hope you will interview Dr. Menolascino concerning the system of community programs he developed in Nebraska. This will be a logical tie-in with the series of public meetings ACC-PARC has been sponsoring concerning community residential alternatives to institutionalization. Community programing is a priority thrust of PARC, this Chapter, and the Department of Public Welfare. Meetings were held in May and in June, with a third meeting scheduled with Secretary Frank Beal on November 20.	(See enclosed letter/meeting notice.) We believe Dr. Menolascino's comments will be valuable in comparing community programs in Nebraska with the lack of such programs in Pennsylvania and the crucial need for their development.
