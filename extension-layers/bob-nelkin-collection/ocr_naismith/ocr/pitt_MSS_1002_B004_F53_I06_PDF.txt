IOC 'Ceam
The IOC Team has commended the Program Services Department for its organization and programs. They noted that 70 out of 130 residents were on maladaptive programs md that there appears to be a decrease in maladaptive behaviors and a increase in rewards. They stated that the monthly summaries were well written.
Pay rooms
Recently, the Board of Directors gave their approval to refurnish the dayrooms. Ibis is an excellent idea, since we do not want our residents' living environmental to be "institutional" but to have a home like atmosphere. However, I am gravely concerned about the effects that it will have on our programs, since no consideration was given to the residents' programs when these ideas were formulated.
We have been given compliments and commended for our different programs and their organization. For example, on the third floor, which the majority of residents are non-ambulatory and require sensory stimulation, positioning and range of motion exercises. There are 34 residents remaining (Tuesday-Friday) on the floor to be actively programmed and 44 residents (Saturday-Monday; in the evenings). The present .plans include a water mattress, bookshelves, mats, table, chairs, living.room area, TV on the floor. Where are these residents going to be feed and programmed? Is there going to be the physical space needed to implement programs?
Presently, our third floor programs meet the programmatic and space needs of our residents. The third floor dayroom feeding program is divided into taco areas (feeding; in activity area). The Surveyors require that all staff should be involved in feeding and that residents are not to be waiting to be feed. It will be almost impossible to accomplish these goals, if the necessary physical space is not available. In order to program 34-44 residents, and to meet their needs, two structured programs have to be simultaneously be conducted with all the physical changes in the third floor dayroom, this will almost be impossible.
The scheduling of the wallpapering of the dayrooms, I can not understand, why wallpapering the third floor and the sanding of the fourth floor had to be scheduled for the same day (1/25/83), which produces alot of strain on the Program Services Department.
The survey will probably be early this year (May). Due to the physical changes in the dayrooms which no consideration was given to residents' programs, the new avograms will not have enough time to be organized and implemented for us to do well.
i s writer's concerns are being ignored and arc not being addressed. Mv concerns should not be interpreted as being uncooperative or negative; (as they often are), hut of deep concerns of problems that will occur.
Ihcrc are other avenues that can be pursued instead of going straight for
-5. jest ruction of our present organization of our residents’ programs.

program Aides Attendance Contest
The second and fourth floors have maintained a 90% or better attendance record for six Keeks! The third floor slipped one week but are back on track. This urogram appears to achieved our main objective of trying to decrease absenteeism.
Comp-Stor Program Aide Schedule
Program Aides' schedules were revised to give us maxium coverage on all the floors for three shifts and placed on the Comp-Stor.
The names of staff, days of the week, vacation, personal holidays, will be entered onto these schedules, then they will be posted. Due to unforeseen events, these schedules, will be implemented in March instead of February.
