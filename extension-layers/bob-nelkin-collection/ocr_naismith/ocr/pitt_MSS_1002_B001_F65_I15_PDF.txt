C. A. Peters, Executive Director of ACC-PARC, will serve as moderator for the panel and Norman W. Mulgrave, President of the organization will preside. Since the alleged forced drowning of Louis Novak, a mentally retarded youth from Sharpsburg, in a state supported interim care facility last August, residential services for retarded citizens have become a timely subject.
The public is invited to attend this meeting to hear first hand reports about conditions in state institutions and interim care facilities; the role of inspection teams; and the rights of parents and residents. Ample time will be allocated for questions.
