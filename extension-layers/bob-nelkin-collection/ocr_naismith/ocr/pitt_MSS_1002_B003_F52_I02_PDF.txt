Dear Secretary Beal:
Tn response to Ak. Buchanan's letter, Xe: the construction of modular units on grounds at Ebensburg State. School, T would like to clarify 4ome <?i5 Z/ie. cxp/ie44ed concerns. —	.. •
The. quote. "--intermediate classes, all be held within the. modular, unit facility" although accurately quoted certainly does not reflect our intent. T mast admit the phrasing of the last several paragraphs leads to some ambiguity of intent.
Oua future utilization of said facilities would continue to be within the transitional training concept, is oua school age residents decline and Intermediate Unit #08 becomes less involved, we would anticipate continuing Department of Public Welfare contracts for lease of off-grounds faciliti.es for the ongoing education and training of the Over 21 Population, perhaps emphasizing as the need arises more sophisticated programs in domestic skills. Eventually, the modular units could be phased out completely, serve as a preplacement vocational training area, or utilized as office. space.
Contrary to Ak. Buchanan's interpretation of my appeal, we do and can {find additional space, to accommodate the need {or community educational involvement. Currently, we have 300 young people attending the Borough School in Ebensburg. intermediate Unit #08 is in the process of leasing a well maintained building in Vinco, Pennsylvania, which is a short distance from the school. This facility wilt accommodate from 100 to 150 students dally on a 5 hour, 5 day a week basis.
Our real need' then, boils down to transitional training on grounds in order to prepare the profoundly retarded, multiply handicapped to participate in the community based programs safely and meaningfully. Tn September, we will have, between 400 to 450 students participating in community education. With the. modular units on grounds, we could effect Immediately transitional training for 80 students, as opposed to the 20 students now cramped in a leaky, poorly ventilated, poorly lighted and poorly heated area. T am well

aware the contents oft the Consent Agreement and am satisfied the Intermediate Unit #08 has explored ait seven alternatives as specified by Vr. Carroll. However, I will not pursue this avenue o^ on grounds com traction without at least the understanding ofi PARC and sanction o£ the Department.
May 1 conctu.de with my personal committment to deinstitutionalization. Our projections fior future use o& modular units are no more than speculations. Should the entire community thrust gain appreciable momentum, 1 would hope to see, not only the modular units, but also several living area units standing empty ^Ive years farom now - or put to some use serving community needs. Tn no way am I supporting the concept ofi broadening or entrenching the institutional concept. Our only aim, ambition and desire is expeditious movement o& students out o$ the institution. To accomplish this, we must plan carefully, move cLcs erectly and place electively. Mass "dumping'1 will not eliminate institutions and indeed, may well have adverse ejects on our efforts to accomplish orderly deinstitutionalization!
