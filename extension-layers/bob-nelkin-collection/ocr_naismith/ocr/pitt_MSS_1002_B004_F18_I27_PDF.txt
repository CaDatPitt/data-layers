I wish To proxesT your recent dismissal of Dr. James McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State Scnool and Hospital. Dr. McClelland has been greatly wronged by your recent action. The cnargesc you made against\V7ere completely unwarranted and unjustified-*. By your recent action, you showed a complete lack of understanding for tne situation. Dr. McClelland has served? the state of Pennsylvania devotedly for the past thirty-three years.
He has proved himself a capable administrator and physician.. Your dismissal of him was not only cruel, inhumane,, degrading and indecent, but also shows a complete ignorance ON YOUR PART in affairs pertaining to the care and treatment of the mentally retarded. Your action in this matter will have a very detre-. mept^l effect upon the residents of Polk whom you claim to serve’. By robbing them of this capable administfater, yon have stabbed them in the back! Their expressions of love towards Dr. McClelland should make it clear to you how- very, very much they want him and need him. I beg you in the name, of decency to rectify yourself in this matter by immediately reinstating Dr. McClelland and PUBLICLY APOLOGISING forydeplor-able actions in this matter*	YouR
