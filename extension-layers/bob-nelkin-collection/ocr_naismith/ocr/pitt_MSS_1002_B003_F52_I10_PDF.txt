Following is a list of immediate needs as determined by the Intermediate Unit I to provide a more appropriate educational program during the 74-75 school year. Included also are those demands being made by the Teachers through the Pennsylvania State Education Association which in many cases relate to the Department of Public Welfare.
1. Seven additional full time teacher aides must be hired to rovide coverage in all the structured classrooms.
. Eight part time teacher aides working from 11:00-2:30 are
peeded to provide additional assistance during this peak period which involves the feeding of many of the students and followup care.
3. A Physical Therapist or two part-time Physical Therapist are Reeded during the school hours to relate to the needs of many of our students.

be provided to all programming areas, that it is questionable if they meet
5.	A prompt reply by a nurse when requested by the teacher to examin a child who looks ill and if found to be ill an immediate removal from program for medical attention.
6.	A need for students to be witheld from educational programming when it has been determined that the child has a communicable disease, ie, trench mouth etc.
7.	The students with acute diarrhea are not being witheld from program or being removed from program. This greatly reduces program time when several cases exist in the same class situation.
8.	A student who previously received medication at noon is not receiving that medication presently. Thus behavioral changes have been noted in some of the students and a change back to the previous practice may be warrented.
9.	When a student becomes violent and/or destructive, being dangerous to himself or others a nurse should observe and remove from program to insure the safety of all involved.
10.	Heating problems are evident in both the units and the outlying educational program areas. There is very poor ventilation on the units and thermostatic controls are not adequate in Evergreen, etc.
11.	A need exists to utilize all available space on the units including the bedroom areas to program children.

13.	The main front closet on each of the units assigned to education for programming are needed to store educational materials and supplies.
14.	There is a definite need for all students to be ready to begin programming at the 8:30 starting time. Within one program area
on Cedar Lodge delays of two hours are not uncommon.
