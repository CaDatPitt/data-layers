PROPOSED DENTAL SERVICE INVENTORY
Introduction
The Department of Public Welfare and the Office of Mental Retardation are committed to providing all of the professional services required to meet the needs of the mentally retarded residents of State Centers. One such service is the provision of appropriate dental care.
In recent months, a great deal of emphasis has been directed toward the review of the dental services at two State Centers - Ebensburg and Cresson. These reviews, while emphasizing specific problems at these two facilities, also indicated the importance of completing similar reviews at all of the remaining State Centers. This proposal details a process to inventory dental services at each remaining State Center. Inventories will be completed during site visits conducted by an independent (not employed at the facility) dentist. These visits will be devoted primarily to completion of oral examinations on a sample of approximately 10% of each facility's population. The dentist will provide the Department a report in a format described herein which will be used to define needs for improving dental services at each facility.
Facility Priorities
The Office of Mental Retardation has established the following facility priorities for the dental inventories:
1.	Selinsgrove Center
2.	White Haven Center
3.	Hamburg Center
4.	Polk Center
5.	Woodhaven Center
6.	Western Center
7.	Pennhurst Center
8.	Marcy State Hospital
9.	’ Embreeville State Hospital
10.	Laurelton Center
Time Frame for Completion
It is believed that a period of approximately two days will be required to complete the dental inventories at each MR facility. In addition, approximately three weeks will be required to complete each written report and to prepare it for presentation for review to the facility, the Regional Office and the Central Office of Mental Retardation. These time frames are based on the experience of the review teams who completed the initial Dental Reports for Cresson and Ebensburg Centers.
With these time frames in mind, and with the understanding that the appropriate staff must have approximately one week to review the written reports, the following tentative scheduled is proposed for the inventories:
-2-
Facility	On-Site Review Dates • 1979	Completion of Report 1979	Review Meeting 1979
Seiinsgrove	March 29, 30	April 20	April 27
White Haven	April 26, 27	May 18	May 25
Hamburg	May 24, 25	June 15	June 22
Polk	June 21, 22	July 13	July 20
Woodhaven	July 19, 20	August 10	August 17
Western	August 16, 17	September 7	September 14
Pennhurst	September 13, 14	October 5	October 12
Marcy	October 11, 12	November 2	November 9
Embreeville	November 8, 9	November 30	December 7
Laurel ton	December 6, 7	December 28	January 4, 1980
This schedule would allow us to complete all facility reviews by the ned of this calendar year, with the final review meeting being held in early January, 1980.			
Personnel Completing	Inventories		
A single dentist will be utilized to complete the inventory at each State Center. This person must:
1.	Be appropriately licensed to practice dentistry in
•	•	the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
2.	Have experience in providing dental services directly to developmentally disabled persons.
3.	Be willing to accept the condition that all reviews are the property of the Department and are for their use.
This dentist would be assisted in the completion of the required oral examinations by appropriate staff from the facility reviewed and/or the staff person from the Office of Mental Retardation.
-3-
Inventory Coordination
An individual from the Department's Office of Mental Retardation shall be designated with the following inventory responsibilities:

It should be noted that is some or all of the recommendations are not supportable, this person will prepare a statement as to why that is the case prior to presentation to the Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation.
5.	.Will insure the timely compilation of quarterly updates
on the status of all recommendations by the responsible Regional Office to the Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation. This status report will list any difficulties in the implementation of any recommendation and will propose any additional action which may be necessary to provide quality dental services.
6.	Will prepare a final summary of all of the inventories completed in the MR Centers, listing all recommendations implemented and a status report of all recommendations for presentation to the Deputy Secretary for Mental Retardation by the end of January, 1980.

Projected Cost
A cost of $250 per day plus expenses will be required for the dentist completing the reviews. Allowing this cost for a two-day review plus an appropriate amount for expenses, it would indicate that each facility inventory will cost an average of $600. The ten reviews will, therefore, cost an estimated $6,000. The specific amount for each facility will depend on the amount of expenses involved in travel lodging.
The dentist will be paid by contract with the Department out of Appropriation 40 funds. It would be suggested that each facility inventoried be responsible for assuming the cost of the dentist for the reviews completed there.
