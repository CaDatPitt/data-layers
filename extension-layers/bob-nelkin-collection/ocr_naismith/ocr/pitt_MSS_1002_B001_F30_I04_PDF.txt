The Department's emphasis during the fiscal year in mental retardation programs continued to be on the expansion of services in the community to enable mentally retarded individuals to live, work, and be a part of community life.
Community Living
Arrangements (CLA)
First started in 1972, Pennsylvania’s community living arrangements program has made it possible for over 4,300 mentally retarded people to live in group homes, apartments and other residential settings. Almost half of these people were formerly residents of State Centers.
As of June 30, 1977, 2,338 individuals were living in CLA settings. Another 1,900 had moved through the program to more independent living situations in the community.
Funded in 1972 with $1.9 million of State monies, the community living arrangements program budget for 1976-77 was $15 million.
Increased emphasis was placed during the year on establishing apartments and other smaller, more home-like residential settings. The number of apartments increased by 153 over the previous year to a total 568. The number of group homes increased from 124 to 162.

GROWTH IN COMMUNITY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS PROGRAM
Attention also focused on establishing community living arrangements for persons with multiple handicaps who need extra support in order to live independently.
Family Resource Services
Assisting in providing that support both to mentally retarded people participating in the CLA program and to families with mentally retarded members living at home is the Family Resource Services (FRSI program.
Using existing (generic) services provided in the community whenever possible, the FRS program meets such needs as emergency care for the retarded family member in times of family crisis, in-home therapy, parent train
ing, homemaker services, transportation and recreational opportunities.
First initiated in 1973, Family Resource Services are provided to more than 16,000 (unduplicated services) families. Funding has increased from $392,000 to $3 million.
Early Intervention
It is during the period before birth and the first five years of life that the greatest potential exists for the prevention and amelioration of handicapping conditions. During fiscal 1976-77, over 6,000 pre-school children took part in 125 early intervention programs throughout Pennsylvania.

Vocational Rehabilitation
One of the major needs of mentally retarded persons is the opportunity for employment. During the year, 5,790 persons participated in 150 vocational rehabilitation programs including evaluation of interests and skills, occupational training, personal work adjustment training, and job placement.
Statewide standards for sheltered workshops were adopted in June and a new program of regular inspections and evaluation of work-training facilities is now underway.
Other highlights of the year include:
—The number of residents in the State’s 10 mental retardation centers continued to decline, falling to fewer than 8,000 persons by the end of the fiscal year.
With a better than one-to-one staff-resident ratio, it is more possible to provide individual assessment of needs and treatment programs for residents. Each Center is now preparing an individualized treatment plan for each resident, including a projection for possible placement in a community living setting and an estimate of supportive services needed to enable the person to live in the community.

I lie difference
—Peter P. Polloni was appointed as Deputy Secretary, effective March 28, 1977.
—Castle Creek was opened. It is a facility in Franklin offering recreational and vocational opportunities for residents of Polk Center. This program allows Polk to extend its programming for almost 150 residents from the main campus into the surrounding community.
—New regulations were promulgated further safeguarding residents’ rights and guarding against undue restraints and protecting against abuse.
—Through Project MAIN (Mobilizing Attainment of Individual Needs), more than 200 direct service staff and 500 residents have received training in the skills needed for effective community living arrangements programs. The project received recognition at the American Association on Mental Deficiencies Annual Meeting in New Orleans.
—The Fourth Annual Art Show was held in the William Penn Memorial Museum in Harrisburg in April 1977. More than 150 entries — all winners of local and regional art shows for mentally retarded citizens throughout Pennsylvania — were displayed.
