We have reviewed our Supervisor’s Daily Report and Critical Incident Report for April 15, 1975, concerning Carl Fisher who was reported ' missing on April 14 and was found deceased today.
Carl’s last contact with our personnel occurred at 12:30 P.M. on April 14 when he asked MRA I Willis Boyd if he could go for a walk in the yard outside the cottage at Hillcrest colony. Mr. Boyd instructed Carl that he may go out for a walk but not to leave the lawn area. He was last seen standing in the lawn area outside the cottage at approximately 1:00 P.M- Following the shift change at 2:00 P.M., Mr. Fred Young, MRA II, was unable to find him. Mr. Young searched for Carl in the grounds immediately surrounding the cottage as well as within the building proper and notified the Northsidg, Supervisor of Carl’s absence at 3:00 P.M. Our only other possible information to account for Carl’s leaving the area came as a result of questioning other residents. Joseph Martino, a resident of Hillcrest colony, said that Carl had left soon after dinner saying that ’’there was too much snoring at night.”
A description of Carl and the clothing which he was wearing was tiven to Security Officers by Mr. Young when they began to investigate the incident shortly after 3:00 P.M. Our Northside Supervisor notified Security immediately following Mr. Young’s report, and a number of MRA’s participated in the search party which consequently found Carl on April 15. Between 3:00 P.M. on’April 14 and 1:00 P.M. on April 15 our personnel had no further contact with the situation.
