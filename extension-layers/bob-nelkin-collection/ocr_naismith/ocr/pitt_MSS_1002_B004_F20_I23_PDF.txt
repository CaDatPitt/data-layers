Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
We were shocked, to hear of the dismissal of Dr. James McClelland. We feel that this action was unjustified, and made on face value.only. Thirty-two years of service ended, by two hours of superficial observation is incredibly absurd and unfair.
These allegedly "cruel, degrading, and inhumane conditions"	»
for which Dr. McClelland was abruptly discharged arc necessary safeguards for the welfare of the patients. Perhaps you would prefer complete restraint of the patients instead of the so-called "cages".
P.A.R. C. officials also commented on the "baggage carbs" used to transport residents through the complex. Perhaps they would recommend immobility .
Put the fact is, they didn't recommend anything. The only solution was firing Dr. McClelland. Me fail to see the rationale of this action. Sven if these alleged problems do exist, one man cannot be blamed.-.
We protest this dismissal and. feel on the part of the P.A.R.C. is inexcusable.
this blatant politicking
Sincerely,
Lois Anthony J
