In view of the circumstances surrounding Dr. McClelland’s dismissal as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital by Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth, Secretary of Public Welfare, I an compelled by reason and conscience to write to you on his behalf.
Over the past twenty years Dr, McClelland has built a solid foundation of faithful service both as a Physician and Administrator. He is a man of integrity, dedication, wisdom and strength. His guiding influence has enabled the staff at Polk to overcome many hardships created by a lack of resources arid has transcended the attitude of special interest organizations who have come to criticize but not to help him in his efforts to provide better care for the mentally retarded. To condemn Dr, McClelland, to deny him justice and dignity, kindness and compassion only expresses ironically the dismal failure of Helene Wohlgemuth and the P.A.R.C.
Dr. McClelland’s willingness to improve conditions for the residents at Polk, to implement workable and realistic programs, to create a home of love and dignity, to provide lasting and constructive change can be readily demonstrated. All one has to do is take the time to fully investigate. Yes, it is true that Polk could be a better institution for the retarded; however, is Dr, McClelland to blame for the legislature denying adequate funds that would result in better programming and care for the retarded. Someday all reasonable citizens will recognize that Dr. McClelland was not only a capable Superintendent but a father to the residents at Polk (He knew most of then by name) a friend to the employes, and most assuredly, a man of -reason and compassion.
It is for these reasons that I respectfully request that Dr. James H, 'McClelland, Jr. be reinstated as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital. As for the P.A.R.C. I can only pray, "Cod forgive them for they know not what they do."
Sincerely,
Thomas W. Snyder Eox 259 Main Street Polk, PA 163U2
