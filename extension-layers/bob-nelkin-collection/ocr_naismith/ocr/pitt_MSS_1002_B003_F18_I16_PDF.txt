Osar Chuck:
?Ze would like to reiterate to you, <md through you to *4r. Taylor and Secretary ^ohlgeuuth, sc&e of the statements which W9 rnado at a November 25th meeting* You will recall the Coroner was asked to investigate another death, thia one due to a heart attack wnich it would seem had not been properly treated* You will also recall that while the Coroner did not f^el his office should have been called in this flatter, he probably did not feal it .an entire waste of tiitv since it w^s» hare that he discovered the "secret taaia" about which he has b^en so vocally displeased*
l4e are very frankly appalled and concerned at the
Absence throughout these grave days of the Medical Director* Za ar* well aware that vacations are needed and Should not ba taaq^red with except in.- cases of extreme ciuorgency* Such an extreme esergsney existed at Western and yet the Medical Director could not be reached-' having left no forwarding telephone numbar*. Ihis seena inconsistent with a position of such authority*
ft a must also be so bold as to question th» judgsant of .J.! concerned in the fact that th a Radical Director would go on extended la-«va while a fulltima doctor w&3 on three weeks’ vacation and another doctor had'been on sick l?uva since august*
he wonder also why ■ * Medical Director- weald £o on vacation during the time when one of tha r?cst critical moving of patlsnt3 (total ears) and residents frota one lodge to another m baking place* It ’*ould sesm fro® a lay parson’s point of view that ovsry medical person on the staff would* have been nwade available on mving day and for at lsa^t a week following*
The above questions and viewpoints aro not "official rarents Group* position- nor do ws intend to discuss the sxatter at ^ur lieceisbor steeting* We feel, however, that it serits sosse serious consideration by all concerned ord w® respectfully request that soma thoui;ht be given to it by you who have ncre znowlodije and quite possibly even differs®! opinions fross otirs* 7^ tender ours for <*hat ti.ay 2*ay be worth •
sincerely yours,
