Dear Governor:
As a praticing attorney in Venango County for over 50 years, Past President of County Bar Association, Past President of Oil City Lions Club and Charter Member, I have been in close touch with many local people and the administration at Polk State School.
I believe you are already aware from the extensive publicity and many telegrams and letters you have received that the people in this are aaxcKvery much perturbed over the firing of Dr McClleland as Superintendent, and which we feel was hasty and ill-advised considering his past record, and that any undesirable conditions could have been corrected without such drastic action.
I therefor urge that both yourself and Mrs Helene Wohlgemuth give consideration to reinstating Dr McClelland pending outcome of his appeal to Civil Service Commission , which would go along ways toward quieting down apparent public disapproval .
I believe it is evidence of high principle and good statesmanship for a person or persons in authority to admit that a mistake has been made rather than to remain adamant as to reconsideration.
State Capitol Harrisburg, Pa.
