Dear Bob,
At the Liaison Committee Meeting on Thursday, December 19th, 1974, it was stated that there was a massive weight loss at Pine Lodge, Unit III during the previous month. Specifically, it was aledged "that the children on Pine Lodge, Unit III, lost an average from 6 to 11 pounds per individual.••.since November 18, 1974". Joe McKenna, Intermediate Supervisor, verified this weight loss by checking the nursing records.
I hope you will respond to these questions regarding the weight loss allegations!
1)	Did Pine Lodge, Unit III individuals lose
6 to 11 pounds during the period from November 18 to December 18, 1974?
2)	What is the reason for this weight loss?
3)	Did you, the Assistant Superintendent for Mental Retardation Services, the Director
of Medical Services, the Director of Nursing Services, or the Director of Dietary Services know of this problem prior to December 18, 1974? If not, why didn’t you know?
4)	How serious is the problem?
5)	What actions have been taken to remedy this problem?
