"We will look into areas that can’t be easily measured. We will talk with residents and staff members in efforts to find out what the problems are.
"We will ask the kind of questions nobody else is asking. We will measure the relationships between people. We will identify program strengths and weaknesses," the Secretary said.
The Department has already started a staffing review of the state mental health institutions and the new special team effort will carry that work forward as well as evaluating other types of facilities.
Last year, the Department initiated a major review of all private licensed facilities for the mentally retarded, receiving information enabling better treatment for persons in such facilities.
All Department of Public Welfare institutions including mental hospitals, institutions for the retarded, state general hospitals, youth development centers and restoration centers are being reviewed on a continuing basis throughout the year.
