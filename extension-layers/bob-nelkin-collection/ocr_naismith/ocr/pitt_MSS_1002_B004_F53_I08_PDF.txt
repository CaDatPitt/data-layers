Dear Dottie:
As a result of ARC of Allegheny County and of Pennsylvania visits to State Centers over the past several months, I would like to submit a list of A.R.C.'s recommendations for the Centers. Some of the recommendations I have previously discussed with you.
1.	Direct care staff seminars: Direct care staff/ aides who have shown creativity and ability could meet in a two day session to share' ideas on programs which they
have developed at their center. A guest facilitator could be invited.
2.	Resource Guide: Ideas on effective programs and equipment for severely handicapped clients, as well as age appropriate resources used by Center staff, should be collected by the Central Office. This could be published annually to promote an exchange of effective ideas.
3.	Use of community and other program resources:
a.	Encourage center staff visits to community programs and specialized Center programs for exchange of ideas i.e. programs for visually imparred, community workshops, etc.
b.	Encourage center use of community volunteer resources i.e. volunteers from colleges, Foster Grandparent Programs, etc.

4.	Inservice training on meals: Creative approaches should be utilized to make meal times more normalized.
A possible guest speaker could be Robert Perske.
5.	Development of handbook on suitable environments in Centers: O.M.R. could develop a handbook to be used by centers similar to the O.M.H. Handbook on Creating Therapeutic Environments in State Hospitals.
6.	Development of a unified system of program planning across state centers: A system should be developed which would make aides more aware of and able to carry out individual program plans.
Also, as we had discussed, has a decision been reached on notifying A.R.C. of serious incidents and unusual deaths at State Centers when they occur?
We look forward to meeting with you to discuss our recommendations in more detail. Please call me to arrange a meeting time which would be convenient for you.
Sincerely,
N. Karen Kelly
