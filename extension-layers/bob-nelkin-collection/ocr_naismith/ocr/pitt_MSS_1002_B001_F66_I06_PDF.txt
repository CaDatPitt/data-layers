Dear Mr. Peters:
I have received your letter of April 28 regarding the applicability of the Department of Public Welfare’s lien law as it affects parents of children residing in state schools and hospitals and interim care facilities for the mentally retarded. I have referred your letter to Deputy Attorney General Edgar Casper for consideration, and you will be hearing from my office in the near future.
Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.
Sincerely yours
J. Shane Creamer Attorney General
