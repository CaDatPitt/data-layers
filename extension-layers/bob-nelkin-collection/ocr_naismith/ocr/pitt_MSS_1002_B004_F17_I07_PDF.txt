Dear Governor Shapp:
o
I think the summary discharge of Dr. James H. McClelland of Folk State School was overwhelmingly politically motivated and a disgrace to the Commonwealth of Fennsylvania.
I do not know Dr. McClelland personally, but his reputation is beyond reproach. I find it hard to believe, that two women that have no professional training can and should have this kind of influence on hi8 career. Consequently, I am submitting this as an unsolicited objection to his treatment.
¥
Sincerely,
Roland H. Corbet, h.D.
