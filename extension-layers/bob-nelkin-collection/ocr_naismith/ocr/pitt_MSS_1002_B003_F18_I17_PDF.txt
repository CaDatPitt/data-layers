A report and questions were never sent to WSSH Because of Paul Jenkins’ tragic death that night. He choked on the food served during our inspection. The major questions on Health and Safety were raised publicly.
These notes were from a meeting with the dietician and her staff and a tour of Spruce Lodge and Beech Cottage to review the adequacy of the food service.
1)	"Three ounces of meat is normal portion - two ounces at noon, four ounces at night."
2)	"Four ounces of diced pork on a day in question."
3)	Macaroni and spaghetti served same day?
4)	Out of meat for one whole unit?
5)	Green pepper considered a vegetable?
6)	Complaints kids not getting enough from CCA and nursing.
7)	"What difference to serve two pastas in one day."
8)	"Beef noodle casserole is nutritious - has cheese in mix - nothing wrong with it."
9)	"Penn State has a service to evaluate institutional food -have not gotten a print-out yet - feel it will rate us good." (Institutional Food Research and Services Nutrition and Inventory Report)
10)	Is it possible to give individuals a choice of food - to stimulate learning "choice and independence"?
11)	"Cottages get institutional prepared food carted over."
12)	"Cottages get to keep leftovers to snack on'."
13)	Not enough porkchops in cottage for seconds - mash potatoes, and corn muffins (vegetables - not available because of delivery problem) on another day?
