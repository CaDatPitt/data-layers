Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:
The parents of the residents of polk State School are not Worried; they are angry,
What the parents, most of the employees and post of the residents want is fox’ Dr. McClelland to be reinstated and we will not really be satisfied with any other arrangement.
It is beyond me how anyone could have so much authority as to FIRE someone without an investigation. I have suggested to Governor Shapp that you be obliged to wear a straight jacket for one day and work one week in the worst division of the school before you pass judgment.
When I brought my son home for Easter, he had a cut and swollen lip and jaw and no one knew how it had happened. He is unable to tell anyone when someone hurts him and there are so many to watch, it is absolutely necessary that tl e violent ones be restrained some way and the cages sound ruch more pleasant than a roxam in which the person can’t even see the others or be near them; also better than restraining belts and jackets etc.

The real fault is with our unrealistic society that -forces existence on those poor creatures who would be better off dead, since living.
Yours
K.
