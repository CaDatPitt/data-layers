Dear Mr. Hiltner:

'Mr. Robert J. Hiltner Superintendent Western State School 333 Curry Hill Road Canonsburg, Pa. 15317
behalf of one ci
I am writing you in constituents, Mrs. Margie Burland of Pittsburgh, Pa. who has appealed to me for assistance in establishing the feasibility of admitting her son to Western State School.
In her correspondence, which I have attached for your reference, Mrs. Burland indicates that her son's name was added some time ago to the waiting list for admission. However, she fears that legal actions threatened by the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens may hinder her urgent need to place her son in light of her recent physical impairment and subsequent inability to care for him.
Accordingly, I would appreciate your advising me at my Pittsburgh District Office of her son's current status on the waiting list for admission to Western State School. Additionally, if you are aware of any efforts by the P.A.R.C. to hinder admissions, I v.'ould be interested in knowing what your,action has been toward assisting those who are seeking admission in order that I may properly respond to Mrs. Burland.	,
HJil: jmc
