THREE M3XTES OF PROCRESS AT PGLIC STATE SCHOOL & HOSPITAL
The bars arc off the windows, and the door stands open in
Cottage 1 at Polk State School. Three months after the controversial
April 17 disir.issal of the Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital, Dr. James McClelland, Polk, outwardly hasn’t changed much. Inside the large office with roll top desk, however, a flurry of activity during the past three months has generated a quiet excitement at the Institution. "I ava quite enthused with the cooperation and willingness•to develop seme
new program direction at Polk State School on the part of many staff,”
Joseph Colombatto, Acting Superintendent, said recently.
Polk, three months later, is not the same place. It never will
be. The enthusiasm which Mr. Colombatto has referred to has generated excitement for:
...Forty-six staff members who have volunteered to take part in a projected experimental program on the Polk grounds. Called a Placement Readiness program, this innovation will, allow those residents with potential for community placement an opportunity to learn and test their skills in a somewhat independent environment. Existing staff apartment housing will be used as residences for the. young women. A series of planning sessions have been held to date to develop this program.
...A committee consisting of top level staff, child care
aide staff members and residents at Polk has been
appointed to analyze and compile all rules and policies

existing at Polk, both written and unwritten. This
Policy and Rule Review Cor&uittee has been formulated
in order to develop a consistent policy for both residents and staff which is fully understood by all.
.The Cottage 1 program, initiated in late April, is now totally open. The use of confinement calls, dry scrubs and punishment techniques has been abolished. The 3taff is involved in developing individual programming for each resident, and group recreation, work, and training programs are now a part of the every day routine. Attempts are being made to provide an individual program for each resident in this cottage, with specific goals for each resident in. rind.
.A Referral and Placement Tof.v developed with County
Meat?] Heal th/lien tai Retardation programs in the 14-county area served by Polk, as well as private agencies such as the Easter Seal Society, United Cerebral
Palsy, etc., will hold meetings every Tuesday at Polk, with these county organizations, during which all referrals for services to the mentally retarded ir the area will be discussed. Each referral will be discussed and evaluated in terms of how Polk might provide services through staff evaluations, etc., in the community, and how communities might better serve the retarded in their areas.- This Referral and Placement Team, developed after a series of meetings between Mr. Colon.bat to and

Polk staff, Mil/MR Directors from eight northwestern counties, and service agencies.
...A Parent-Staff Association has been organized at
Polk State School and Hospital, by parents, with the support of the administration.
...In cooperation with the Venango County Action Program, an effort is being made to generate funding to attempt to develop a Foster Grandparent Program at Polk. The initial planning allows for 75 to 80 Foster Grandparents.
...Plans for the first Bar Mitzvah at Polk State. School and Hospital in the fall are beinp completed. Bar Mitzvah preparations are underway now for Jewish residents, "Although it does not sound very significant," C.olombatto stated, "It has a tremendous impact on attitude for the families of these residents, and for the staff that has worked with them."
...Clarion State College and Polk have developed a pilot program which will begin in August on the campus of Clarion State College. Fifteen residents from Polk and fifteen retarded residents from communities in the area will live in a dormitory on the Clarion College campus for three weeks during August. Several staff members from Polk, Clarion College staff, and graduate students from Clarion State will serve as housenarents, counsellors, and instructors during this period. This experimental program was developed,

sponsored, and funded jointly by the Venango County Mri/dLR. Office, Polk and Clarion. "We’re going to take a look at it," '-fr. Col-ombatto said. "Perhaps it can turn into a permanent program. It’s being done in other states. This pilot program can show us where we need to go in terms of program, staff and all the other ’bugs’ that need to be irone.’ out. before a good ongoing program can be developed."
Pointing to what she termed "heartening beginnings," State Secretary of Public Welfare, 'Ire. Helene Wohlgemuth outlined a goalspecific vocational training program which is in the process of being developed at Polk and will be implemented within the next two to three weeks. ’Even with the existing problems at Polk, progress in the form of programs for residents who formerly had very little in. the way of individual programmin'* is under way. A. vocational program which emphasizes the native, abilities of severely retarded persons is a beginning. The increased involvement of local covimunities is a beginning. The formulation of a parents group is a beginning. The devl.e.epment of an attitude that these residents can be stimulated, can be helped, can be worked with is a beginning, and the ending will be a more humane and socially responsible approach to the education and care of mentally retarded residents at Polk," she aaid.
Another problem at Polk, staff to patient ratio, has also been an area of constructive action. Without an increase in complement, 61 Child Care Aides have been hired, an additional ton full-time Registered •Nurses were recruited. Pediatric Residents from Childrens Hospital in
Pittsburgh have, been recruited through the Western Regional Office of
the*artment of Public Welfare to do physical examinations on Polk residents. With the assistance of a Nursing Consultant from Pittsburgh, an attempt is being made to develop better nursing coverage through the daylight and evening hours within every residential unit utilizing existing staff. By September, additional special education teachers will insure the implementation of the Right to Education at Polk. Through the cooperation of the Intermediate Unit, all residents between the ages of 5 through 21, regardless of the severity of their handicap, will receive the benefit of an educational program at the Institution geared to their specific needs.
"There are no longer cages or playpens at Polk. Tn at option
to control behavior no longer exists, so other options have to be developed, ttied. Yes, it’s hard on the staff, but this is a staff that Is willing, hard working, and cooperative. In the very near future, a program will be developed utilizing our Psychiatric Consultants. This ’Behavior Clinic’ will be developed, with the participation of staff, to provide programs and techniques specifically designed to eliminate severe negative behavior. Each resident with a severe hehavior problem will be. examined by the Psychiatric Consultants, and his problems and behavior discussed with personnel who work with the patient on the wards. This kind of ’vhat-to-do’ approach, where staff can discuss problems with an expert vhould go a long way toward eliminating the need for restraints, drugs, or isolation as an approach to a person with behavior problems,’’ said Mr. Colonbat to.
There are no more bars on the. windows of Cottage 1 at Polk. Brightly-colored red couches now brighten the day room at the cottage, and through the open doors, staff members from the education department, social service department, recreation department enter and leave with residents
