Dear Mrs. Thornburgh:
Thank you for your letter of May 7. I am sorry I have not been able to respond to your request sooner. I understand it has been clarified for you that the 23 positions were positions already available at Western State School and Hospital but were not filled. It seems the more serious problem at Western is not hiring of additional staff but to find appropriate placements for a number of residents who are now residing in that facility.
It is my understanding that the in-service training program is progressing well at Western and that the new unit will be in operation around May 27.
You did request that you have the opportunity to review with me the specific plans for the unit and the process by which the residents would be selected. Neither of these requests is appropriate to my function. The superintendent and the staff of Western have the authority and the responsibility to develop the specific plans for the unit and the process by which the residents will be selected. If you would like to discuss this matter with Dr. Scott I am sure that she will be agreeable to meet with you.
I understand from Dr. Mui grave that eight residents have been moved into the Robinson Developmental Center. I am pleased that they have become operational and look forward to having the facility become fully operational.
Please feel free to contact me at any time if there is something that I can do on behalf of the mentally retarded. Your continued interest is greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
(Mrs.) Anna Belle Calloway Deputy Secretary
