The Pennsylvania Medical Society urges you to call for a study funded through the legislature to bring together a number of now uncoordinated studies of the Mental Health/Mental Retardation Program in Pennsylvania as a step toward a single, thorough, objective evaluation of the entire situation. Our Society pledges its cooperation in such an effort.
The state administration and legislature should participate in, but not dominate, a general investigation led by a national figure with an unquestioned reputation for objectivity. As additional participants we suggest representatives of the general public, private mental health and mental retardation groups and leading professionals in the mental health/mental retardation fields.
The information currently available to us indicates that Dr. James H. McClelland, the former superintendent of Polk State Hospital, is a victim of the state’s difficulty in establishing and administering practical uniform guidelines with adequate funding in the mental health/mental retardation area. In addition, the emotionalism surrounding the dismissal of Dr. McClelland tends to obscure the real issue -- the quality of all of the care and services provided by the state

to the mentally ill and mentally retarded. The general investigation we recommend should be authorized promptly under auspices that would avoid any political stigma. Political or personality issues dare not be involved in anything so serious as assessing the quality of care and services provided to the retarded and mentally ill.
The issue is not the use of restraining enclosures for those patients whose periodic violence to themselves and to others cannot be controlled adequately by drugs. The real issue is the total quality of care the state provides and this needs to be impartially assessed and made public so that facts and not emotionalism will be the basis for action.
The general study we recommend is sorely needed and we call upon State Government to authorize it as promptly as possible. We pledge our support for such a move and our willingness to participate in it.
Sincerely yours,
Robert S. Sanford,^M.D.
President
