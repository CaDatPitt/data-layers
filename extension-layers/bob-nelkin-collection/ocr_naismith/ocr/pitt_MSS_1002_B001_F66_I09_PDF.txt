Dear Mr. Peters:
The Department of Welfare does not feel it would be the best interest of the Commonwealth to drop the claim of $35,000 which has been lodged against the estate of James Bullotta, father of Peter Bullotta.
Specifically, the attorneys for the Department of Justice recommended that the Secretary of Welfare not discharge the obligation.
In further investigation of the situation as it pertains to claims for maintenance for patients cared for in state institutions before 1969, when the Lien Law was removed, I learned that there are 829 outstanding liens remaining amounting to $3,024,700. It is my intention to have legislation prepared which would remove these obligations.
Regarding peonage in state institutions, Governor Shapp and Secretary Wohlgemuth have announced their abhorrence of this practice and have pledged to eliminate it over a three to five year period beginning in 1972-73. The first stage, for which there are 516 positions requested in the Governor's recommended budget, will allow the Department of Welfare to end peonage in institutional laundries.
Very truly yours
Thomas F. Lamb
