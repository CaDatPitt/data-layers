Dear Ed:
1
Norm Mulgrave has asked me to write. Thank you for the time you gave us on Monday, October 23. All of us feel that such frank and open conversations are extremely beneficial. Norm will attempt to get ACC Board approval for the procedure discussed for any future "Ridge Views" or "Mountaintops". Our next board meeting is on November 21.
In the meantime our investigating team, under Ginny Thornburgh and staffed by Bob Nelkin, will continue to visit facilities housing Allegheny County residents.
There are a number of other matters that require our action. It is our understanding that you will notify the appropriate county MH/MR units and PARC of the names, addresses, etc., of any residents now residing at White Haven who were transferred from Ridge View or Mountaintop. The expectation is,that plans will be made by the county units to return them to their home county or at least their home region. PARC will also be notified so they may increase the support of local Chapters to assist in the relocation of these
'children. To facilitate dispersal, we will begin preparing applications for group homes and will vigorously explore the possibility for a foster home network.
You may recall that we discussed regional inspections in great detail. We want to take this occasion to formally protest the fact that a DPW employee heads these ^regional teams and also that visits are announced. We feel these should all be surprise visits. A consumer or at least a neutral staff person should head the team.

There certainly should be a second unannounced visit by the team within 30 days of the first inspection.
We feel, as a result of the Mountaintop experience, that DPW has been remiss in providing technical assistance to interim care facilities. We would like to suggest that OMR assemble a technical assistance team of ARC and DPW staff to provide training in programming to the interim care facility. As an initial effort, there may be some value in assembling all operators of interim care facilities for such training and then sending technical assistance teams out to regions for local training. In short, OMR and ARC should anticipate deficiencies and attempt to correct them.
We look forward to meeting with you.
Best personal wishes,


C.A. Peters
