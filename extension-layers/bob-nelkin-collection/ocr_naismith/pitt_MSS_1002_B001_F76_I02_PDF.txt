CHAPTER
Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc.
April 1976	KXDl BRIGHTON ROAD Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15233 telephone;(412) 322-6008
If you are a parent or other interested person in Allegheny County who:
(1)	is concerned about the availability and the quality of educational opportunities for people who are mentally retarded, and
(2)	is interested in working for the improvement and expansion of existing educational programs for individuals who are mentally retarded ,
then you might be interested in the ACC-PARC Education Committee.
This ACC Board Committee has the responsibility to promote and monitor the educational opportunities available to mentally handicapped citizens. The rationale for this function has developed from the belief that quality education depends upon the involvement of interested people (parents and other concerned community members), outside of what we have traditionally defined as the education establishment.
Participation in this Committee will allow you to interact with other persons interested in the development of appropriate education experiences for people who are mentally retarded. You will reflect ideas, produce resolutions and develop strategies, all designed to improve the quality and the availability of education for mentally retarded individuals. Your committee involvement will include one meeting per month, but your level of activity within the sub-committee and special project groups can be governed by your interest, time and desire to participate.
Some of these activities might include: visiting existing programs; meeting with school directors, administrators, teachers and parents to discuss existing and needed services; working on inter-agency task forces concerned with education issues; reviewing laws, regulations, standards and policies that affect the education of individuals who are mentally retarded; making recommendations to the ACC-PARC Board of Directors for the development of agency policy.
Remember, as a member of the Allegheny County community, you are in many ways a consumer of the educational programs available. If you are concerned about these services, one avenue of involvement that might be of interest to you is the ACC-PARC Education Committee.
If you would like more information, or if you are interested in serving as a volunteer on this Committee, contact Bill Casile at the Chapter office.

YOUTH-PARC IN ACTION
DIAPER NEEDS
SURVEYED
The Hampton Unit of Hope Corps Council moved into action when they heard that residents from the Highland Park Center could not attend a Youth-PARC sponsored dance at the Airport Sheraton Inn because they lacked transportation. An open plea to all the students at Hampton High School brought in nickles and dimes .. whatever change the students had in their pockets that day... that amounted to the $70 needed to rent a bus. Quick thinking and the spontaneous response of many young people allowed those at Highland Park to have a Saturday night "get together" that will be long remembered.
The Western State Unit of Hope Corps Council is once again coor-dinating the Bike-Hike at Three Rivers Stadium. They will be man ning check-points from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and invite any Youth-PARC members or friends who want to join them to call Nancy Daily at 276-3868. Have fun - get involved!

ATTENTION OUTDOORSMEN (AND WOMEN)
Did you receive the recent Annual Enrollment mailing concerning the special insurance plan available from NARC? If not, or if you’ve delayed taking advantage of it, here’s an easy way to get information about this unique protection. You may call the Protection Plan administrators free on their national telephone line. Just dial 1-800-237-7771 and ask for Pat. The administrators will answer any questions you may have and send you materials explaining the plan if you wish. If you prefer to write, the address is: NARC Protection Plan, P.O.Box 18384, Tampa, Florida 33679.
The Protection Plan is special insurance protection arranged by the NARC at much lower than normal rates. It’s available only to NARC members and provides coverage up to $50,000 without a health examination. It’s designed to solve the problem of member parents’ greater need of life insurance protection for their familes.
The South Hills Area Developmental Center had a compliment right before Christmas. The children were waiting to ride the train at South Hills Village, and the woman running the train told Jo-Ann, the teacher, that it cost 15 cents a child. There was some grumbling among the adults because the children had always ridden the train free.
Finally the woman came over to explain that she was sorry but only retarded or handicapped children Could ride the train free. She looked surprised when told the children were retarded. It was almost worth paying to ride the train. Three cheers for normalization!

ACC-PARC’s Down’s Syndrome Group schedules education meetings two or three times a year to teach parents and professionals more about Down's Syndrome (formerly called '’mongolism"). For information concerning the Group's activities, call Sue Vandervort, 322-6008.
Southwest Habilitation Center is gathering items to furnish a "practice" apartment as a part of their independent living skills program. They would appreciate donations of useable kitchen appliances and utensils, household items, etc. Items may be taken directly to the Center, Bengs Building, Bridgeville, or may be brought to the ACC-PARC office, 1001 Brighton Road, North Side.
ACC staff members are enthusiastic about new summer programs for adults who are mentally retarded that will be implemented this year on a trial basis. They hope to obtain donations of camping and fishing equipment to begin the program. If it proves successful, the program will be expanded in the future and hopefully equipment could be purchased at that time. But for this year, it is hoped ACC members will respond to this appeal with their customary generosity and will donate useable camping equipment, fishing tackle, Zebbco rods and reels, bobbers, sinkers, hooks, nets, stringers, etc.
Send or deliver equipment to the ACC office, 1001 Brighton Road, North Side, or call 322-6008 .. talk to Bob Kasten or Sarah Cook.
In 1972 Sue was a staff member at Western State School and Hospital and Richard was a volunteer. And now they're married and have an 11-*$ year old son named Glenn.
Let's start the story back before Glenn knew Sue and Richard. Let's start with a boy named Bobby who was (and is) a resident of Western State. For five years, Sue and Bobby were friends and he spent weekends, holidays and summer vacations with her. During those visits, he seemed lonely and Sue wondered if she couldn't share those happy times with another resident. Bobby and Glenn were friends and last summer both boys joined Sue and Richard for their vacations.
When Sue and Richard decided they wanted a foster child to join them as a family, it was a difficult decision to make: Bobby or Glenn. But it appeared that Glenn would benefit most from a foster home setting and had more potential to develop. So, in December, Glenn moved in with Sue and began a new life in his first "real" home. He had been placed at a facility for infants and children, then transferred to Western State, and had lived in an institution all his life.
Sue and Richard are technically a "host" family since permission for Glenn to live with them was granted by Western State and a court ruling was not necessary. Glenn's parents are alive, but have maintained only minimal contact with him over the years. Limited involvement exists between Western State and Glenn. Sue and Richard receive a small Social Security Income check each month toward his room and board and clothing.


Glenn attends Pathfinder School and can continue to do so until he is 21. Then "who knows?", says Sue, "maybe a group home would be best for Glenn. We'll have to wait and see." But for right now, with Pathfinder for a school, and Sue and Richard for a family .. Glenn has learned (since December) to count to ten and is beginning to understand the numbers; some letters of the alphabet; to take a bath; to partially dress himself; to go up and down stairs; and almost write his name. His vocabulary now contains several hundred words and his speech is much clearer. His social behavior is more appropriate and he's more outgoing and friendly.
Glenn is a Down's Syndrome child, and Sue and Richard wondered what the reaction would be from their families and friends when he came to live with them. They need not have worried, because he has been welcomed as a member of both families. "Kids come to play", Sue says, "and there haven't been any neighborhood problems."
He's a real member of the community, too, attending Sunday School (with

Incidentally, literally hundreds of our members know the Sue of this story:	Sue Mussman, ACC's Camping and Recreation Coordinator. And you all
know that this isn't really a love story about Sue and Richard. It's a love story about Glenn.
PHILADELPHIA PLANS TOURS
The Philadelphia Association for Retarded Citizens- has designed a regular series of three-hour historical tours for developmentally disabled and handicapped citizens. The tours, in special audioequipped, air-conditioned vans, began April 1 and will continue throughout 1976.
For additional information, contact the Philadelphia Assn, for Retarded Citizens, 1211 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107.
Tony Orlando has been named Honorary Chairperson for the National Association for Retarded Citizens.
"My sister Rhonda was born profoundly retarded," Orlando explained. "I've always wanted to be able to help her and the rest of the six million mentally retarded people in this country and do it in a big way. My sister died in August and since then my interest has become even more important and imperative to me. Now by serving as National Chairperson for NARC, I can work with 300,000 people who have a similar interest."
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
YOU ARE
WELCOME ...
"POISON-PROOF" YOUR HOME
Did you know that in Pennsylvania mentally retarded adults are employed in more than 100 different vocations? ACC-PARC's Job Placement Counselor is responsible for the development of all job tryout sites and job placement activities for Parc-way Industries. He would welcome the opportunity to discdss possible employment opportunities for people who are mentally retarded; and cites a recent study which proved that hiring mentally retarded workers in jobs for which they are qualified is sound business practice.
For further information, call Bob George, 322-6008.
to attend a meeting of the ACC-PARC Board of Directors. Meetings are held monthly at the Chapter offices on the North Side. Call the office, 322-6008, for the date of the next meeting.
"Small children, especially when they are at the age at which they crawl and begin to walk, are fast and fearless explorers. As they busily investigate new territories, they put anything they can intc their mouths — no matter what it looks or tastes like."

Some MH/MR services are free of charge. (They are listed under question two.)

(0) How is the charge determined?
The sliding scale is based on your ability to pay as determined by the MH/MR unit.
A formula is used to determine your charge. It includes consideration for: (a) total salary, (b) number of dependents, (c) federal tax paid, (d) work expenses, (e) educational expenses, and (f) medical expenses.
The liability clerk at the MH/MR unit will determine your cost. You have a right to know how or why the determination is made.
Changes in any of the factors listed above should be shared with the liability clerk. The liability will be adjusted accordingly.
(5)	Do maximum payments reduce over a period of time?
Yes. For non-residential services, the maximum amount you can be charged is reduced.
At the end of three months, your new maximum liability is determined by dividing your previous payment by the number of dependents.
At the end of the first year of service, the maximum liability is reduced by 10% and continues to lessen by 10% each year.
Thus, consideration is granted for people who will use services over a long period of time. The longer you use services, the less you are required to pay.
(6)	Are medications included as a service if you pay maximum liability?
Yes. If you are paying maximum liability, you are eligible for medication on the MH/MR lists at no additional charge.
-3-
(7)	If your son/daughter is 18 years of age or older, how is the charge for services determined?
Once a person who is mentally retarded reaches age 18, the liability charge is based on his/her personal income.
i Until age 18, the liability charge is based on the parents' income.
This relief of financial obligation of parents resulted from the passage of Senate Bill #53, which was sponsored and supported by parents across the state.
(8)	If services are not available from the MH/MR unit, can the MH/MR unit contract with a private agency?
When it becomes necessary to provide services that are not available within that MH/MR unit, the unit can, if fiscally feasible, contract for those services. In some cases, these services (speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, etc.) may not have higher priority than other needed services•
(9)	Who should you go to if you think you are being overcharged?
Most questions about charges can be handled through the local MH/MR unit. However, you should be aware that a mechanism exists to appeal the liability. Contact PARC or the Allegheny County MH/MR office.
SUMMARY:
Some families will benefit by obtaining services from MH/MR units since the maximum cost is reduced each year. A sliding scale, according to ability to pay, is used to determine charge; and many services, including medication, can be obtained under the one fee.
