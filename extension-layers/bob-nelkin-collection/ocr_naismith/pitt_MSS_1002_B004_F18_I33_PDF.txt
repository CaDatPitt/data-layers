Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth, Secretary Department of Public Welfare Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Dear Mrs. Wohlgemuth:

Reading in the newspaper of your firing Dr. James McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital brought extreme disappointment at the shocking arbitrary act.
I first visited the Polk State School and Hospital in 1954 and have made frequent visits to the institution over the past eighteen years. For the past ten years I have had close contact with the institution.
I have always been impressed with the fine treatment the residents at Polk have received with the limited number of pro fessionals and non-professional employees and with a physical plant so embarassingly ever-crowded and out-dated. In all aspects of his work Dr. McClelland has done an excellent professional job.
Over the recent years there has been a fantastic growth in the educational programs for the residents and the in-service training program for the employees at the institution. I have been intimately associated with the growth and development of the speech, hearing, and language program at Polk. Under Dr. McClelland's direction this program has grown to be the finest program in the nation for a residential school.
Dr. McClelland has done an outstanding administrative and professional leadership job at Polk. It appears that the Secretary of Welfare should be censured for not providing adequate human and physical resources for the operation of Polk State School and Hospital.
