Dear Governor Shapp,


I was very dismayed to learn of the decision to relieve Dr. James McClelland of his duties as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital. On the occassions I visited and worked at Polk State School and Hospital conducting management training sessions, I observed the conditions of employee performance and morale remarkably high under Dr. McClelland's leadership.
In my many associations and professional endeavors with superintendents and other management personnel employed in institutions for the retarded throughout the United States, I may have met superintendents who performed as effectively as Dr. McClelland, but certainly none who performed better.
In the interest of the retarded individuals served by Dr. McClelland and his staff, I sincerely hope that the order that terminated his employment as superintendent will be rescinded.

Sincerely,
William E. Garove, Ph.D.
Associate Director
Management Training Program
