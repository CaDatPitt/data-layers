Copy of telegram sent to the Honorable Milton Shapp, Governor, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on April 23, 1973.
We wish to advise you of our shock at, and complete rejection of, the recent dismissal of Dr. James McClelland as Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital. Our office as been swamped by calls from an incensed citizenry representing this entire region, demanding his reinstatement-and the chastisement of PARC and those involved from your Department of Welfare. We would remind you then that to govern is to rule without soveriegn power with the aim of keeping a straight course and smooth operation for the good of the whole, this then dictates Dr. McClelland’s vindication which we support. Justice must prevail.
