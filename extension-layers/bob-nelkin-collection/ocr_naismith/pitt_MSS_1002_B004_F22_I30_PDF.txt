The Honorable Milton Shapp Governor of Pennsylvania State Capitol
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Dear Governor Shapp:
The news releases as to the firing of Dr. James McClelland, Superintendent of Polk State School and Hospital, are observed and unacceptable to the citizens who know him.
Dr. McClelland is a fine, dedicated, community leader. While, no doubt he was following rules and regulations set by superiors in Harrisburg, the use of the terms, "inhumane, cruel, and degrading", as stated by Mrs. Helen Wohlgemuth, Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare, as reasons for his dismissal are not deserving of Dr. McClelland's character.
Personally, and in behalf of the many citizens who have we believe a re-]S in order.
called my office, and the Chamber of Commerce, traction of the terms stated for ins dismissal
We who visit Polk State School more often tary’s two hour visit have the deepest respect tration and for the school.
tnan the Secre-for the adminis-
GM:r
Sincerely,
/S' .
olite, Mayor
_^-€c. - Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth, Secretary Department of Public Welfare
