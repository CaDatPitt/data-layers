Polk ‘drama’ a rerun of a biblical parallel
The writer of the following letter was employed at Polk State School and Hospital from 1934 to 1972, when he retired.
Polk, Pa. Editor, The Herald
The plot for the recent play staged in the “Capitol Comedy Theater" at appear to be similar play Bible. The recorded in I Kings. Chapter 21, and the striking similarity of it to the modern day drama compelled me to comment on it.
As you entered the theater you would be handed a program and the Cast of Characters would ollows:—■.
Harrisburg would a plagiarism of a recorded in the original play is
King Ahab went to bed. turned his face to the wall and refused to eat.
Looking back to the finale of the original play, the one Supreme Critic and Judge (God) does not approve of the plot and in Verses 17-22 He voices His disapproval to King Ahab and announces the end of his career. The final curtain was lowered on the career of King Ahab in I Kings 22:29-38.
In Verses 23-24, God voices His disapproval of Jezebel and announces the end of her career. The final curtain was lowered on the career of Jezebel, II Kings 9:30-37.
No further mention is made of the two false witnesses. They were not worthy of any further recognition. Of course there are the stooges, both past and present, who will be rewarded according to the importance of the roles they played.
We now await the finale of this modern version and I am sure the same Judge who looked down upon the original play will also be watching this second play, Hph 412--------_-------.

Anyone who has visited Polk, or known Dr. McClelland. would find it impossible to believe the accusations. Long before the “behavior shaping specialists." referred to by Dr. Sidney Kaplan, were in graduate school attempting to master the gobbledegook so necessary to qualify as a certified do-gooder, Dr. McClelland and his dedicated staff were dispensing what is so badly needed by his charges — love.
