Ms. Helene Wolgerauth
State Department of Welfare Harrisburg, Pa.
Dear Mg. Wolgemuth:
I want to congratulate you on the uncovering of the deplorable conditions existing at some of our state’s mental institutions.
I wish also to raise the question as to what effect on our institutions results from political appointments to the boards of directors of these institutions.. Specifically, and locally, I would like to object to the recent appointment to the trustees of Danville State Hospital of Frederick T. Trump, who is Court Recorder of the Columbia County Court and Democratic Party Chairman fol- the same county•
Mr. Trump, while no doubt well intentioned, is not professionally qualified to hold such a post. There are people in the county who have a long history of involvement with mental health, both professionally and in a volunteer capacity. I am thinking especially of the officers of the Columbia Montour Mental Health Association.
I wonder too whether a conflict of interest does not exist in such an appointment, especially since our local law enforcement and judicial officials are not known for their tolerance of those people with possible mental problems.
Having worked closely with Mr. Trump in last fall’s campaign, 1 have reasons to doubt both his sincerity and his wisdom. I do however believe that he is politically ambitious, and therefore not averse to such an honor. But, with competent and qualified people in the area, I hope that you will reconsider this appointment. Thank you.
Sincerely.yours,
