Sir;
Something has to be done about the helu at Spruce Lodge Total Care Unit at Western State School and Hospital in Canonsburg and done at ones* On the three to eleven shift, I find only two girls taking
• care of 40 total care patients and now one of the two girls (Mary is retarded and is not capable of .giving them the care that is needed* Sven though Mary a a nice person and she tries hard oh© has put a rectal thermometer in a child s mouth who can bite and does not realize the danger involved. This is sheer negligence on the part of the authorities at Western State School and Hospital and action must ba 'taken immediately.
I also see these children are back to laying on the floor or in bed all day without any attention from anyone except the little the attendants are able to .give then. There i3 trained personnel who are very good with these beautiful children, but, I suppose the new director feels it 13 wasted on the total care* Well—I disagree, and if need be I will call every open discussion program I can an;: also write a latter bo the editor of our local paper*
Your immediate attention to this crucial problem is requested.
Re spectfully,
Joy Gafforini
