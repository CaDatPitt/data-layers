Dear Mrs. Calloway;
On Tuesday, May 25, 1976, our association and state association made a joint visit to Polk State School and Hospital. During the course of the visit, we inquired whether there were any current plans to expand the Polk Dispersal Project. Polk Superintendent, Nick D’Aluisio, informed us that, currently, no DPW staff person was planning for significant transfers from Polk to the community.
We urge you to develop additional plans to relieve overcrowding at Polk and provide the transferred residents with a more humane and beneficial setting and programming. Please inform us of specifications, if you do develop additional plans.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin, Associate
Executive Director
