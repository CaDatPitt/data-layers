MEETING
DEPUTY SECRETARIES CALLOWAY AND MEYERS
AT
WESTERN STATE SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL
April 28, 1975
The terms of the agreement that stopped the strike by AFSCME were:
1)	No retribution to strikers from DPW
2)	Overall staff training
3)	Establish a separate unit for the aggressive men
staffed from the current WSSH complement
4)	Special training for the workers to work on this unit
5)	The union will assist DPW in reducing the astronomical
absentee rate at Western
6)	Communications will improve between WSSH administration
and staff
7)	Another review of the possible excess of staff in the
professional areas
Calloway - we'll get people out of the administrative offices and onto the units.
Calloway - there will be no additional staff. I let Harrisburg know that there will be need for additional staff. We did not receive an answer to date.
Meyers - we have already made our needs known (for more staff) to Harrisburg.
Calloway - I’m available in my office if you want to jointly monitor how this program is going. Give me a call.
Calloway - don't act as if you're the only advocates. I've been involved in two hospital settings (Torrence and Somerset State Hospitals) and I've been on the other side of the fence, as an advocate.
Meyers & Calloway - are opposed to use of restraints and did not agree to a locked unit.

01 Connor - who is running the show, the staff or the superintendent?
Calloway - there are ways to make staff work and there are ways not to make staff work.
Calloway - we met without the superintendent in case they (the union) wanted to talk about the administration. They did not speak about Dr. Scott in the formal meeting.
Mrs. Calloway implied that she or Harrisburg was critical of Dr. Scott.
Meyers - Ruth Scott has been appointed the Acting Superintendent, with no intention of seeking a replacement at this time. That is the DPW policy for any state school and hospital appointment.
Calloway - on the matter of communications, this place will have to improve. We opened up the lines of communication today. Part of the creditability problem was with the regional office.
Calloway - on the implementation, Scott will send me a plan this week and the staff training will begin next.
Meyers - questioned about the need for a consultant who can frequently visit Western State and the various shifts so there would be no problem getting a consultant in Pittsburgh, if we can locate one.
In attendance at the meeting, DPW - Anna Belle Calloway, Deputy Secretary, Stanley Meyers, Deputy Secretary, Larry Jenkins, Deputy Commissioner of MR, (not attending, Ruth Scott, Acting Superintendent), Jerry O'Connor, Chairman, CPLAC, Gloria Mitchell, President, Westmoreland County ARC, Steve O'Donnell, Executive Director, Westmoreland County ARC, Ellen Siciliano, ACC Board Member, Marlene Burda, Chairman, Residential Care Committee, PARC, Angela Zondus, President, WSSH Trustees, Bob Nelkin, Associate Executive Director, ACC.
The meeting went on for a couple of hours. Members of citizens' organizations strongly criticized the union and the Department of Public Welfare for coming up with a non-solution. The discussion was heated at times. The remarks quoted above are only fragments of the total discussion.
