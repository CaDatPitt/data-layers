Unannounced Visitations
I

FROM:
Dr. Harry Goldberg President, Parent'
Acting Superin Western State
On May 13, 1975 an unannounced visit was made to WSSH. Shortly after the visitation, several staff members approached me with a memorandum dated 2/5/73 which detailed the ground rules for such visits. The major concern expressed was that no member of the Board-o-f-Zru-stees-had been-included in this particular visitation group.
It is my feeling that the 2/5/73 memo ought to be reviewed at the next Liaison Committee Meeting and changes maybe suggested.
Would you like to include this on our agenda?
