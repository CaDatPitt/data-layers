Dear Governor Shapp:
I	"*■—	_ ^^---■	«
We, the members of the Franklin Junior Woman’s Club, are reaffirming our concern and position on the untimely dismissal of Dr. James H. McClelland, Jr. from Polk State School and Hospital.
Dr. McClelland has dedicated over thirty years of service to the retarded residents of the Polk State School and Hospital. Through the years his concern has been for the patients and their welfare.
Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth, Secretary of Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, in a Saturday visitation of two hours and in only three buildings, made an unjust and drastic decision. Her tour was too fast for such a vast complex as Polk State School and Hospital, and her decision was premature. To challenge Dr. McClelland’s knowledge, his experience, and his concern for patient welfare in a two hour visit is quite unbelievable!
We are appalled that you have not personally investigated such an important situation where the welfare of 2,800 retarded residents is at stake.
We request that in the.interest of the residents of Polk State School and Hospital, and for the injustice that has been done to Dr. McClelland you will immediately take action.
that Dr. McClelland’s reinstatement will
We trust be forthcoming
. 7/7
Sincerely,
hZ-Z'C c
