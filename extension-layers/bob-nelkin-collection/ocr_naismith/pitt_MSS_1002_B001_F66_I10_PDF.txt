DRAFT
From the outset, Allegheny County Chapter, Pennsylvania Association for
Retarded Children, would like to applaud KDKA for its long history of editorial
support of the mental retardation movement.
Unfortunate Iy,
requires reply.
We agree with KDKA that the real issues
in the current
mental retardation
controversies may have become obscured. The
KDKA ed itoria I

alleviate that obscurity. The station used such phrases as

House Appropriations Committee in the current fiscal year. There was no mass emotional outcry from the mental retardation movement and certainly none from an aroused citizenry. And yet, people should be involved emotionally and react
emotionally to statistics like Pennsylvania’s rank in service to the retarded.

The
issue that has been obscured, a^nd the statistics revealed, is that /
Pennsylvania does not adequately care for her mentally retarded citizens.
KDKA then said“it is "almost impossible to provide adequate care and
supervision for some of the more severely retarded patients." Difficult?
Depending on how you measure, that may be so. Impossible? ’Other states do it.'/In the litany of unsatisfactory alternatives to the Polk cages—such as straps/cha i ns, straight .jackets, excessive tranqu i I i zers little mention

alternative. The issue that has been obscured is the existing

philosphy of providing not what is best but what is cheapest!! More staff would cost money a\cl legislature has chosen to ignore the needs of retarded citizens.
Pennsylvania ranks twentieth in the nation in number of full-time staff.
The station then said, ’’The various and sundry investigations which have
been carried on may not always have been conducted on a truly professional lias is.. .we question whether the people in charge of programs are necessarily
the best equipped*to investigate themselves." ACC could not agree more.
However, the station overlooked the efforts of professionals from the
Allegheny County Mental HeaIth/MentaI Retardation Program and the Auditor
General’s office. The station might also have noted that teams of experts,
from outside Pennsylvania, have been spending extensive time at Polk State
School and Hospital. Polk, incidentaly, is the current, but certainly not
the only, facility worthy of investigation.
KDKA might have noted that Allegheny County Chapter consumer investigation and evaluation effort was recognized by the state-wide "Community Services of

In conclusion, we, too, feel the issued are obscured. But, one of the primary reasons they are obscured is because KDKA (and other TV and radio
stations) have failed to use their own investigative and reporting capacity to adequately inform the public about the issues. If truly concerned, KDKA might do for the mental retardation scandal what the "Washington Post"
did for Watergate.
