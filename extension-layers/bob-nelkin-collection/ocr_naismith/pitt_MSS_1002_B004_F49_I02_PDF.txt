Dear Harry,
I have enclosed a narrative report of our visit of December 19, 1975. The visit to Ebensburg was one of a series of on-site, unannounced visits to all State Schools in Pennsylvania which are being carried out by PARC, through the State Residential Services Committee and local ARC representatives.
The narrative report follows a format established last August by the Committee and has been applied to each visit. The narrative reflects conditions as observed during the time of the visit.

I wish to thank you and Mr. Smith for the courtesies extended to myself and Mrs. Leiden. Mr. Smith was most helpful. Your staff, too, are to be commended for their frank replies to our questions.
It was also very enlightening to be able to sit down with you and discuss many of the problem areas evident after the visit to Ebensburg. Your candor and eagerness to discuss possible solutions were appreciated.
As I told you, PARC is most anxious to bring problems to the attention of DPW, the Regional Office and the Intermediate Unit. If positive and constructive change is to come about, we would hope to be able to be a part of this change, through bringing problems to your attention and making recorranendations for their resolution. Our only goal is to improve living conditions in every facility we visit, so that residents of that facility can experience maximum growth in an atmosphere of dignity and comfort.
There is much which must be done at Ebensburg to bring about this kind of environment. I am certain that you and your staff will concur with the findings of this report. Beyond this, I am hopeful that you and your staff will work swiftly and de-ligently to bring about changes at Ebensburg which will assure the rights, the dignity, the training and education which your residents need and to which they are entitled.
It is my earnest hope that PARC can be of some assistance to you in your endeavor to bring about these improvements at Ebensburg.
Sincerely,
Marlene Burda, Chairman, PARC Residential Services Committee
