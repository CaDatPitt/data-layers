Maladaptive Behavior Programming Report to the Board of Directors
We have continued to seek independent reviews of our maldaptive behavior programming, especially with regard to aversive conditioning procedures for severe self-injurious behavior. We have also continued our survey of other treatment facilities in the state with regard to aversive conditioning procedures. State facilities do have aversive conditioning procedures in their guidelines as treatments of last resort for the types of behaviors we have treated. Aversive conditioning procedures are and have been used very infrequently, but apparently not battery shock perse. Nonetheless, it was recently cited at a National Conference on Self-Injurious Behavior given by Woodhaven Center and Temple University that I recently attended as an established, highly effective, and harmless treatment for self-abuse, though naturally a treatment of last resort. An independent review team from the Department of Health found no violations of ICF/MR regulations, as well as a personal review of these programs by Pat Gishbaugher, Acting Commissioner of the Office of Mental Retardation for the Western Region. To insure our further protection, Ms. Gishbaugher suggested, and we accepted, a review by a team of experts from Woodhaven-Temple University. That team again found no evidence that we were operating outside of ICF/MR regulations, but noted from their experience that these regulations did not adequately protect us from legal action since they represented minimal requirements and not ’’state-of-the-art” thinking about residents rights and behavior modification. In light of this feedback, and given that the aversive conditioning procedures had already brought the self-injurious behavior under control, we have discontinued both battery shock programs. We are also in the process of hiring legal consultants who specialize in this area to update our procedures to protect our resident’s rights as well as our facility.
