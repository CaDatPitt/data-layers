Dear Mr. Shapp:
This plea is respectfully submitted that you correct the gross injustice done to the patients and staff at Polk State School when Dr. J. H. McClelland was given the "hatchet" treatment.
We are parents of a Polk patient and well familiar with the situation there. Dr. McClelland; his devoted staff gained our confidence long ago, and this recent development has not diminished it a bit.
Tliere is no evidence of Integrity in Mrs. Wohlgemuth’s purpose and method of attaining her objectives. How can we, as parents of patients, have any confidence in Welfare Department" programs after seeing "alley cat tactics" used by the Director. Shame on her.
Sincer c ly,
John A. and Dorothy R.
c. Mrs. Helene Wohlgemuth
