Dear Parents/Guardian:
Your child will be placed in an educational program under the supervision of Intermediate Unit 6 effective September 1, 1973• This plpcement is the direct result of the Right to Education Consent Agreement.
At this time we want to provide you with a school calendar in order that you can plan your visits to your child and your child’s vacations around this calendar. We ask that vacations and visits occur during off-school times. For example, during established Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations or on weekends your child could be taken home for vacation. Visits will be possible after school hours and on weekends.
Of course, there may be special times when you may need to have your child home during school time. This should be the exception rather than the rule but we will try to assist you during these special times.
We look forward to your involvement with the Intermediate Unit 6 staff as they develop educational programs here at Polk State School and Hospital. It is anticipated that at some future date during the school term a Parents’ Day will be held when you will be given an opportunity to visit the school .and observe programs in operation and talk with the staff members.
Sincerely yours,
Director of Special Education
Intermediate Unit 6
