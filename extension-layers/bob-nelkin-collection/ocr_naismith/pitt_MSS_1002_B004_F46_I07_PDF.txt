Mrs. Gloria Mitchell, Parent of Ebensburg Resident
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have called this press conference today to bring to the attention of the media and through you, the public, a scandlous example of the gross physical abuse and official neglect of the dental needs of mentally retarded residents of Ebensburg and Cresson.
The pictures which provide the backdrop for this conference are neither abstract art nor hallucinations caused by drugs or pictures put together by a photogranher for effect.
These are actual pictures of the mouths--the teeth, the gums, of people. These are people much like you and I in many respects. They are mentally retarded or developmentally disabled. They are residents of a State Institution for the retarded. Primarily they are people with pressing, serious, painful, dental problems. These people are the victims of long standing bureaucratic neglect of a basic health need—clean teeth, healthy gums, repair of dental problems such as cavities, abscesses, gum disorders, decayed teeth which hurt—which need immediate treatment.
This is not a problem which is new. The neglect you see didn’t happen over night. The groups represented here have brought the lack of dental care in state institutions to the attention of the Department of Public Welfare and Officials for years. Little has been done to correct this situation.
Today you will see more. You will be given documents outlining what has been found. You will have documentation of our attempts to correct this sltuation--attempts which date back to 1975.
What you wont see are the faces of the people. You won’t feel their pain.
Today we are demanding that immediate action be taken at Ebensburg and Cresson to treat the cavities, abscesses, gum and teeth disorders of the residents of Ebensburg and Cresson State Centers. This treatment must begin not 3 months from now or
6 weeks from now, but next week. We are demanding and we want guarantees that next week, people who need dental care will, in fact, be in the offices of qualified dentists receiving this care. Beyond this, we demand that a dental investigation be conducted in every Institution for the mentally retarded by qualified dentists trained tn dentistry for handicapped people.
We want to be assured, and we want the parents of the residents of Ebensburg and Cresson to be assured that these appalling dental conditons will be cc-rrectt-d imrnediately--that their children will be taken care of--now! We want a guarantee that in 6 months, a year, two years and henceforward,qualified, trained dentists will be providing quality dental care for all of the residents of Ebensburg, Cresson end other institutions for the mentally retarded.
These demands as well as several others are attached to this statement and we expect an immediate public response from the DPW.
All of us here today pledge that until these goals are achieved we will use every means possible at our disposal, and all the resources we have to put an end to present sub-standard dental care not only at Ebensburg and Cresson but at all Centers where such cases or physical abuse exists.

Dear Frank,
Enclosed is a report by the PARC Residential Services Committee concerning a recent visit to Ebensburg State School. The conditions found at that institution were quite alarming, particularly in the areas of: programming; drug abuse; restriction of movement by residents; staff attitude toward and knowledge about residents; clothing; medical and dental care; and privacy.
In light of the serious problems outlined in the PARC report, as well as observations made in a confidential report by several visitors from out-of-state, we are hopeful that you will read the material in its entirety and advise this Association of the Department's plans for correction.
Copies of these materials have also been forwarded to Ford Thompson, Deputy Secretary of Central Region.
We look forward to hearing from you in this regard.
Sincerely,
Elsie Schmidt, President

Mr. Harry Herman, Superintendent Ebensburg State School Ebensburg, Pennsylvania 15931
Dear Harry,
I have enclosed a narrative report of our visit of December 19, 1975. The visit to Ebensburg was one of a series of on-site, unannounced visits to all State Schools in Pennsylvania which are being carried out by PARC, through the State Residential Services Committee and local ARC representatives.
The narrative report follows a format established last August by the Committee and has been applied to each visit. The narrative reflects conditions as observed during the time of the visit.
I wish to thank you and Mr. Smith for the courtesies extended to myself and Mrs. Leiden. Mr. Smith was most helpful. Your staff, too, are to be commended for their frank replies to our questions.
It was also very enlightening to be able to sit down with you and discuss many of the problem areas evident after the visit to Ebensburg. Your candor and eagerness to discuss possible solutions were appreciated.
As I told you, PARC is most anxious to bring problems to the attention of DPW, the Regional Office and the Intermediate Unit. If positive and constructive change is to come about, we would nope to be able to be a part of this change, through bringing problems to your attention and making reconanendations for their resolution. Our only goal is to impro.ve living conditions in every facility we visit, so that residents of that facility can experience maximum growth in an atmosphere of dignity and comfort.
There is much which must be done at Ebensburg to bring about this kind of environment. I am certain that you and your staff will concur with the findings of this report. Beyond this, I am hopeful that you and your staff will work swiftly and de-ligently to bring about changes at Ebensburg which will assure the rights, the dignity, the training and education which your residents need and to which they are entitled.
It is my earnest hope that PARC can be of some assistance to you in your endeavor to bring about these improvements at Ebensburg.
Si ncerely,
JL-ak-9--

ite of Visit: December 19, 1975
ime of Visit: 10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
uildings Visited: Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 I. U. areas.
• Physical Surroundings
A.	Exterior
Buildings are Mansfield-type construction. Exteriors are wel1-maintained. Proper safety conditions on walks were evident, with snow removed and walks and steps salted. x
B.	Interior
The interiors of all buildings were clean and relatively odor-free. In all buildings, the entrance hall, staff and visitors reception rooms were brightly decorated for Christmas with tree ornaments, posters, and wall hangings. This was in marked contrast to the living areas of the residents.
The "day rooms" in all four buildings were sparsely furnished, mostly with wooden benches and mats on the floor. In some areas, there were square chairs constructed of a plastic or vinyl material. While these chairs appeared to be somewhat more comfortable than wooden benches, it was evident that they were selected because of their "indestructible" qualities. They added little to the appearance of the room, and were uncomfortable to sit in. In addition, there were no drapes or curtains nor were their curtains or drapes on the windows of the bedroom areas. These are certainly necessary to insure privacy for the residents. The bedroom areas were devoid of decorations, and there is little or no personal furniture for storage of personal items.
PARC has a number of recommendations which, hopefully, can be initiated by Ebensburg to remedy the severely sterile and institutional appearance of the living areas in Buildings 3, 4, 5, and 6. It is suggested that Ebensburg contact the School of Design of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Students from Carnegie-Mellon were most helpful in working at Polk in improving the environment of many of the cottages there.
It might also be possible to purchase more comfortable chairs with residents’ personal funds. This, of course, would have to be done in conjunction with some behavior-shaping, so that residents could learn the proper care and use of such furnishings. This should certainly be a goal for residents in these areas.
In addition, the floors of the day rooms are barren and cold to the touch. Many of the residents were lying on the floors. It is recommended that some effort be made to carpet some of the day room areas. Once again, this has been done at Polk with some effectiveness. Area carpets, in standard 9x12 sizes, and bright colors lend a great deal of warmth to a large day room. Since most of the residents in these buildings are toilet trained, carpets could be used without fear of soiling. The carpeting need not be expensive, and it is hoped that some monies can be found in the Ebensburg budget for such purchases.

' TR-In addition, it was evident that the dental needs of the residents are not being met.V In every building, there was evidence of severe dental problems. Residents' teeth were \ filled with cavities and yellowed by neglect. There is great need of corrective and restorative dentistry. The Superintendent indicated that a dental hygienist had been hired. This should help somewhat, but beyond this, there exists the need for at least another full-time dentist or 2 part-time dentists. The Superintendent also indicated that there was no dental equipment for the hygienist, nor any clinic space or equipment. What about the possibility of using community services?
<

It is recommended that a dental team from the University of Pittsburgh Dental School asked to make a survey of the dental needs of the residents of Ebensburg, and that their recommendations receive top priority from the Department of Public Welfare. PARC requests that this agency be kept advised of efforts to upgrade the dental care for residents of Ebensburg, including results and recommendations of any studies conducted in this area.
In the area of personal grooming, a number of problems were observed by the team. In Unit 5, the hair of the girls and young women had been cut so short and styled so badly, that it was difficult to determine whether the residents were men or women. In instances where the hair was somewhat long or curly, it was matted, uncombed, and appeared to be dirty. There was no evidence of any effort to improve the appearance of these girls and young women through attractive hair styling. Men and boys likewise had “institutional haircuts". Many were unshaven, and their appearance was unkempt.
It was evident that the physical appearance of the residents was not a priority in any of the buildings visited. This not only denies the residents' right to dignity, it also connotes an institutional attitude toward the residents. There was little evidence of any personalized approach to improving the physical appearance of residents. This is intolerable It connotes to others that these residents are less than human--that their physical appearance "doesn* t count".
It is recommended that the Unit Managers in each of these buildings initiate a program of enhancing the physical appearance of residents. Haircuts which detract from the appearance of women should be prohibited, and beauticians who work with residents must be advised that hair will be attractively styled, not cut for convenience. A schedule for shampooing of hair, and a program of grooming skills should be devised in each area. Again, aide staff should be included in developing plans to help residents look as attractive as possible. There must be a commitment on the part of all staff to improve the appearance of residents. Certainly, this will help to enhance the resident's image of him or her self, as well as the image he or she conveys to the staff.
In yet another area, which is even more crucial, it was observed in each of the buildings . that residents appeared to be excessively drugged. In general, they were lethargic and /ery slow to respond. Many of the residents were lying on mats, sleeping, or sitting on tenches gazing blankly at the room. Very few residents reacted to the presence of visitors. I hey moved slowly, spoke very little, and appeared very tired. Considering that many of the residents did very little all day, and were described as "hyperactive", this suggested that most of the residents were being maintained on tranqui1izing drugs. This was confirmed >y several staff, and will be expanded in the section of this report dealing with medical ind dental care.
It was also noted that many residents in at least two of the buildings (4 and 5) were larked with enough scratch and other marks so as to be quite noticeable. It is unreason-ible to guess at the cause of these wounds. However, it is suggested that staff on these mits look into this problem and suggest a workable solution. Once again, this area will >e expanded upon in the section of this report which deals with programming.

We were delighted to have you visit with Mrs. Leiden on December 19, 1975. Of course, you understand, I was not overly delighted with you report. Ln all truth, I fuel there were many discrepancies in observations which will be addressed in the attached response and documentation.

I am personally grateful that PARC is anxious to take an active role in resolving the many problems institutions and administrators face. I am in complete agreement that there is much to be done at Ebensburg and I can assure you that this administration and staff is committed to bringing about- improvements in many of the areas of deficiency which you cited in your report.

I sensed an implication in your comments of disinterest and insensitivity to the needs and rights of retarded citizens at Ebensburg. I wish to assure you that this is not so. f have been struggling to reverse an entrenched philosophy at this institution for the past two and one-half years and I am seeing change. I have spent 20 years of my life serving the handicapped young people - 12 of those years have been with the mentally retarded. This has been my choice because I always felt I was innovative and could certainly help to right the many wrongs in the habilitative process for the retarded. I am still actively pursuing that course.

I trust you will carefully scrutinize the attached material and come back to visit us for
more in-depth review.

HRC ADVISORY BOARD MEETING (cont’d)
Discussion was then held on the general lack of a good comprehensive dental program, ✓staff commented that many of the residents are frightened of the dentist and will not cooperate in the procedure. Because of this soma residents are pre-medicated but this does not always Induce cooperation. Mrs. Riden commented that many of the residents would require anesthesia for dental procedures. A list has been compiled stating which residents would need anesthesia, and the institution has begun arrangements. to purchase this service from
a local dental clinic.
There was discussion on the problem of insuring that residents* teeth are not pulled when they merely need to be filled. Staff decided there is no adequate overseeing procedure, and that it would not be proper for non-professional staff to question the judgment of the dentist. Staff commented that we have had some good results in using some outside dentists. For emergency dental services residents are taken to either Altoona Hospital of Altoona Mercy Hospital emergency rooms. Mrs. Hunter asked if there is an in-service program for continued training of unit staff in dental care. Miss McHail replied that a dental hygiene consultant visits two or three times a year. In addition, annually sr.e presents in-service training to unit staff. She has also taught in some of the program areas to staff memberswho are holding oral hygiene programs. Staff agreed that it has been a difficult problem to locate a dental hygienist who will work for the state on a regular basis. Ads have been placed in various journals with no success. Dr. Burrow commented that he is in the process of trying to work out some sort of an arrangement whereby dental students from Pitt University could work with some of our residents. He is also going into negotiations with the Blair Dental Clinic to use its equipment at hours when the Clinic is not open to the public. Mrs. Hunter recommended that the efforts to recruit a dental hygienist be continued and that program staff who are involved in oral hygiene training be invited to all dental in-service programs.
Mr. Seno then reported on the status of the election of a new Human Rights Committee. Mr. Seno is assigned to the Nomination Committee. He reported that he had canvassed a great many people and had found they lack Interest in becoming members of the committee. He has less than the nine names needed for nominations to the nine-member board. Efforts will be made to recruit outside agencies and parents who might be interested in joining the committee. Mrs. Hunter commented that it would be a good idea to find out the status of the proposed guidelines set forth in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as to the composition and functions of the Human Rights Committee. She will write to the rules docket clerk to find out the current status of these proposals.
Ms. Schoeneman reported she had spoken to Ms. Just in the OT Department concerning the privacy of toileting Altoona Center residents. Ms. Just indicated that the recommendation that some of the residents use their private bathrooms for toileting is not being carried out as yet. She believes it will be quite difficult to provide this experience due to lack of staff.

Dear Mrs. Schmidt;
’’Ebensburg” Rc-ard of Trustees jumped out at me when reading about your election as President In the Pennsylvania Message.
My daughter, Lisa, has b^en at ESSH almost 10 years and my only real concern has been about seeing her teeth and gums--per-feet at admisslon--de t «- picrate so badly. Her breach odor is terrible most of the time. h^r gums bleed; the only times she has had real restorative dentistry were on the two occasions I brought her to Philadelphia, had her admitted to a private hospital (where she could be anesthetized). Even though my husband and I both lost several days from work, nnd paid th-° doctor and hospital ourselves (over Insurance) the only important involvement was how the trip unset Lisa--she was; terrified at the hospital, with strangers, and she is very strong. It was a pretty bad experience—mentally and physically—for all of us!
I have received a great deal of sympathy from State officials, and some quite constructive and active help----(Mrs. Elizabeth
Tredway; Dr. Rusynyk), and from time to time, Lisa has been helped. But it is a matter of nag, nag, nag--and I feel that this is in direct violation of her rioht to treatment. Most of the retarded look forward to eatlno", to treats, as th** bl^u-est event in their lives! To let the majority turn into toothless individuals is horrifying. 100k at their mouths, their teeth, the nevt time you’re at ESSH! Oh not the "prod" students, who comprehend, who can be told to ”slt still” in the dentist’s chair, etc. But the kids like mine.
I have a thick volume of a 9-year correspondence and can send you a copy if you like. My biggest problem seems to be a resentment by the department most Involved, an i I can’t understand why, as I only want to help and improve both that department and the condition of the residents at Ebensburg State School A- Hospital.
Very truly yours.

The purpose of thiB letter is to document our dental experience concerning our son,	. .	was admitted to the Cresson
Center in 1970. To the best of our knowledge, he had no dental work whatsoever until August of 1976 when we took him to a local dentist, who was known to have worked on retarded children.	was
v seen again by this dentist one year later and it was recommended.
to us thai We contact Dr. Negley in Huntingdon, Dr. Negley has had ' considerable experience in working with the retarded. In particular, he has set up operating facilities in the J. C. Blair Memorial Hospital • in Huntingdon. Since	was particularly hyperactive and would
not sit still in the dentist’s chair and reacted rather violently, it was \ determined that he would be admitted to the hospital, given general anesthesia, and have his dental work taken care of in this manner.

MEMO
TO:	Steve O'Donnell, Executive Director Westmoreland County Association Retarded	Citizens
FROM:	K. -- Parent of	a resident of for 13 years and 5 months	Cresson Center
DATE :	November 20, 1978	
RE:	Dental care of	
I to the	wish to submit a written statement of my Cressen Center Board of Trustees Meeting	remarks presented of March 8, 1977:
My first statement was one of concern—as a parent and as a registered nurse, regarding oral hygiene for patients and residents		
in institutions who could not provide this service for themselves.
Realizing that shortage of staff is one reason, but the resident does not need more problems added to his existing ones and good prophylactic dental treatment and care would be less costly in the end, resulting in better health and appearance for the resident.
After hearing dental-related concerns of others present, I asked to relate my personal experiences.
• i I was present, along with Social Service and Nursing Staff
members, when my daughter Lisa was examined in the Cresson Center
dental office by Dr. Sam Bricini in the late summer of 1975.
(Cresson Center dental records would reveal the exact date.)
f. ■ .	'	•	•
Lisa was tranquilized with medication prior to the exam.
'	.	’’	■	■ t
Dr. Bricini said he found a couple cavities and he would
check her again in a few months.
I envisioned the cavities worsening due to lack of brushing daily and as Lisa resists any kind of treatment, there would be more pain and consequently more difficulty in handling her.
Staff--all present, asked Dr. Bricini to at least attempt to clean and fill the cavities as she had been medicated.
I agreed with staff. He patted my shoulder saying "You worry too much. She’ll be all right." then asked for the next patient.
Needless to say, I felt pretty low after a fruitless journey of one hundred fifty-four miles (round trip).

On March 24, 1976 at 9:30 a.m. I traveled through the snow to Dr. Bricini's Johnstown office to be present for Lisa's dental appointment.
Although she had been tranquilized, she had inadvertently had breakfast, so was unable to be anaesthetized--work again was postponed.
Once again, I expressed my concern for the residents lack of preventative dental hygiene--at the same time telling staff, that was present of my gratitude for the difficult tasks they perform and acknowledged the shortage of staff persons.
Dr. Bricini replied: "You shouldn’t worry so much. There is nothing you can do for these people." (meaning residents)
He added "I'm not being paid to take care of her" (Lisa). "I wish you would take her somewhere else."
I wondered then and asked Dr. Bricini if he really liked what he was doing.
He replied "Frankly no."
On July 9, 1976 at Pittsburgh's Childrens Hospital, Lisa had a total of fourteen surfaces filled, gum treatment and a cleaning done, with anaesthesia.
On March 7, 1977 her teeth were scaled and cleaned-without anaesthesia.
On July 18, 1977, teeth were cleaned and one was filled savis anaesthesia.
Dr. Sears at Childrens Hospital asked, after looking at her mouth, why residents teeth are not cleaned--added that parents should not accept this situation.
We were told that due to inadequate dental hygiene, premature loss of teeth will occur due to peridontal disease.
Cresson Center was informed that Dr. Nazif, Director of Childrens Hospital's Dental Department would send their staff to Cresson to give Inservice training on dental hygiene to Cresson Center's Nursing Staff--in mid '77. In July '78, Dr. Nazif said he had received no response.
Lisa is unable to return to Childrens Hospital for treatment as she will soon be twenty-one years of age.
I am willing to provide dental and medical treatment for her as long as I am able but am concerned for those who are handicapped and have no one to champion for them.

May I add my sincere gratitude to all at Cresson who have helped us through the years. Institutions, like parents aren't perfect. May we all do better.
Sincerely,
