Dear Mr. Nelkin:
The following is in response to your letter of March 30, 1976:
1.	When the institution applies to be representative payee for SSI the Social Security Administration contacts the family and inquires if they wish to be named representative payee. If someone in the family wishes to be the representative payee they complete an application and
are then named representative payee over the institution.
2.	Parents are usually not contacted prior to application for SSI.
3.	There are accounting controls in the revenue and accounting offices on the funds for which the institution is the representative payee. The use of the funds is determined by the resident himself if he is capable. The staff assists those residents who are not capable to make
these decisions. If and when guardians or advocates are appointed for residents not able to make these decisions this would be more acceptable.
4.	We do not oppose a member of the family to be the representative payee if the benefits are being used in the beneficiary’s best interest.
5.	Not to my knowledge.
VISITING HOURS DAILY 9:00 to 11:00 A.M., 2:00 to 4:00 P.M.
