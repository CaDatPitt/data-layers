I have read Mr. Meador’s report concerning the dohtli of Raytion d Helman.
While the report was preliminary, I have a strong feeling that there was cross .negligence involved on someone’s part. I would like to have the case investigated in depth by someone outside of the institution.- If negligence is involved the negligent person must be disciplined to the fullest extent that the circumstances justify.

Attached for your information and action is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Frank S. Beal to Mr. Norman J. Taylor.
I share similar concern particularly with Dr. McClelland's statement that one of the attendants left a long piece of tie cloth hanging beside Raymond's bed after re-tying him. This is the piece of cloth or cord 'which was around Raymond’s neck. Please investigate this jointly and report back to us.

November 3, 1972 Mr. Vogt and I visited Polk State School and1 Hospital to investigate the death of a resident, Raymond Hellman on October 16, 1972.
Records of the deceased and the resident suspect were reviewed. Dr. McClelland then accompanied us to the dormitory where the death occurred. Mr. Wertz, the Child Care Aide, who found Mr. Hellman's body, demonstrated the exact conditions that he found the morning of October 16, 1972 at ■5:58 A.M. when he arrived to awaken the residents.
A resident was used as the victim and a sleeveless jacket that laced up the back was applied. The long restraining cotton strap was threaded through rhe laces and the resident laid down on the bed. The strap was then pulled through and one end was shorter than the other. Roth ends were then tied to the bed rails, When questioned if this is the way he was taught to apply the restraint,_Mr. Wertz replied he had not been taught. He is a new employee and has nor had the Child Care Aide Training Course as yet. .Another attendant was there and he was asked to demonstrate the way he was taught to apply the restraint and this was done satisfactorily. Mr. Martin,- the Child Care Aide who worked 10:00 P.M. to 6:30 A.M. on October 16, 1972 was then called in and asked to demonstrate how he was taught to apply the sleeveless jacket restraint. This was done satisfactorily and during conversation, Mr. Martin stated that at no time was it necessary for him to re-apply the restraint on Mr. Hellman. At 5:15 A.M. when he made the dorm check, he found Mr. Hellman standing on the left side of the bed but restraining strap was.only loose from the right side of the bed. This would have been the short end of the strap. Mr. Martin stated he put Mr. Hellman back to bed and re-tied the loose end of the restraining strap and returned downstairs. At 5:^0 A.M. he returned to awaken another resident to take him to the dispensary for a blood sugar. Nothing seemed to be awry at that time. Mr. Wertz came on duty early and went to the dorm to awaken all residents and found Raymond Hellman sitting on the floor on the left side of the bed and the end of the restraining strap wrapped '’round his neck several times. Since Mr. Martin had at no time completely re-applied the restraining strap, it was then necessary to talk with the 2:00 P.M. to 10:30 P.M. Child Care Aides, ^r. Carter was asked to demonstrate the application of the jacket and itwas oovious that he did not know how. Vihen questioned,, he too replied that he is a new

enployee and had not had the Child Care Aide Training Course. He also ' stated that Raymond Hellman had a habit of having the jacket put on when he got ready for bed but the restraining strap would be applied just before lights out and this was usually applied by another one of the residents. James Ivory.was the resident that applied the restraining strap on October 15, 1972. Mr. McVey, the other Child Care worker that was on duty October 15, 1972 when the residents were put in bed, was then •_ questioned. He stated he had gone to the quiet room at 9:00 P.M. to check Mr. Washington and returned to the dorm about 9:10 P.M. The lights were out but he did a bed check and remained in •the dorm until Mr. Martin came on duty.
c
All of the Child Care Aides were questioned as to whether they saw any excess -strap on the floor when they checked the restraints and the answer was "no". They also felt that any excess strap laying on the floor would have caught th$ir attention.
It- was also brought out that Raymond Hellman was capable of releasing the restraining strap himself as his arms'were free and had done it in the past. Raymond Hellman was also spastic and frequently he would call out in the night and ask one of the residents to help him to the bathroom. • Ona of the residents told Jr. McClelland and the police that on the night involved, James Ivory had either taken Raymond Hellman to the bathroom or had found him there and put him back to bed.
The Staff ratio the night of the unfortunate incident was:
2:00 P.M. to 10:30 P.M.----------—-----3 Aides
10:00 P.M. to 6:30 A.M.----------------1 Aide
Also one Supervisor of North Side and one'Supervisor of entire male service
Resident capacity was sixteen (16) men.’

This is in response to the report of Pat Gishbaugher concerning the above subject. Pat and Dob Vogt visited Polk State School and Hospital at ay request following receipt of a :xmorandum from Mr. Prank S. Beal requesting a re-visit. Hr. Deal was questioning the possibility of staff negligence and need for a reprimand from the Regional Office.
( If anything should be reprimanded, it is our entire lousy system; however^" I it is obvious that attendant staff is not trained or instructed on how to apply the sleeveless jacket restraint., This would raise the question as y

Unless there is sone exceptionally good reason for this, it would be better for the attendants to have a desk and telephone on the second floor.
I do not feel that the attendant who was on duty can be held at fault for negligence. It is my understanding that this attendant has since resigned his Job.
