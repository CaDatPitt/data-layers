The Honorable Thomas F. Lamb Office of the Majority Leader Main Capitol Building;] Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17120
Dear Senator Lamb:
Thank you for your letter of May 11. We are delighted that you intend to introduce legislation removing outstanding liens. Be assured that we will offer you every assistance.
You might want to consider going one step further and remove parental financial liability beyond age twenty-one. The principle is that it is unfair to financially penalize a family in perpetuity for the birth of a mentally retarded child. Several states have done this. An example of the Washington state legislation is enclosed. This has also been done in Tennessee and Colorado.
We are equally delighted that the Governor and Secretary are moving to eliminate peonage. However, the method by which this is to be done should be of some concern. For example, when the 516 laundry positions are filled, what kind of program will be provided to the students?
Why not employ these mentally disabled individuals, who obviously are good laundry workers, to fill the 516 positions? They could be housed off the grounds in community "boarding houses’* and go to work in the institution. Preferably, they would work at institutions other than the one where they lived as patients•

There’s an obvious double savings. The institutional population is reduced by SOO, saving $3,000 or $4,000 a year per patient and the individuals are given meaningful work.
Again our sincere appreciation for your interest.
Best personal wishes,
C. A. Peters Executive Director
