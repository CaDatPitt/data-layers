Dear Ms Wohlgemuth,
I am writing in protest of your recent publicity seeking and-uncalled for action in the firing of Dr. James H. McClelland as Superintendent and Administrator of the Polk State School and Hospital. As a former pastor in Franklin, Pa. and a regular visitor at the Polk State School, I was able to see first hand the accomplishments which Dr. McClelland brought abbut during the years he gave of himself at Polk. Nov; as a member of the Board of Directors of the Westmoreland County Association for Retarded Children, it grieves me deeply to see the spiteful action you have have taken against Dr. McClelland,perhaps at the instigation of our own state association officers.
It is quite plain that you have taken this unjust action, without the benefit of a hearing, in order to remove some of the criticism that has been placed on your office for past failures and neglect qf your responsibilities concerning the retarded children and adults of our state.
I urge you to reconsider your hasty action in the firing of Dr. McClelland.
sydcerely,./z.
FawL E. Fauth
