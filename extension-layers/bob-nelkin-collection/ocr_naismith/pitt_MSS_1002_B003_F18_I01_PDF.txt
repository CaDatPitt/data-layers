RE:	Runaways at WSSH
Over the past year, I have heard rumors that there have been numerous runaways from WSSH. To validate these rumors, I asked Dr. Ruth Scott, Assistant Superintendent at WSSH, to provide me with reports of these incidents. Dr. Scott has supplied the security report, which I am summarizing below:
1)	On July 6, 1974, Mark Leonard was missing from Pine Lodge for approximately two hours. Later in the month, Mark drowned in the reservoir after similarly running away.
2)	On July 19, 1974, a couple of residents were found at different times unsupervised at the dam.
3)	On July 21, 1974, another resident was missing and returned to his unit.
4)	On July 24, 1974, a Cedar resident was found frightened and naked at Pine Lodge.
5)	On July 25, 1974, a couple of residents were missing and returned by security or off duty attendants to their lodge.
6)	On July 25, 1974, a resident was found at the dam unsupervised.
August 2, 1974, another resident was
On missing and returned to his lodge.
On August 7, 1974, another resident was missing from Pine and returned to his lodge

10)	On August 12, 1974, another resident was missing for three hours.
11)	On August 14, 1974, from Beech.
12)	On August 17, 1974, found two residents
13)	On August 28, 1974, missing from Pine, him on Interstate 7
a resident was missing
a water plant operator at the dam unattended.
a resident was reported State police recovered
14)	On August 29, 1974, another resident was missing and found by security.
Apparently, we would find that similar reports of runaways if we checked security reports from other months. This is another example of our understaffed, underprogrammed condition.
