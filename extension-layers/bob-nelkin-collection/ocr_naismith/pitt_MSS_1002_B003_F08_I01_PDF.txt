Dear Mr. Hiltner:
With reference to our son, State School and Hospital, Pine
a resident at Western regarding the medical
Mark^^^l Lodge II,
management surrounding his grand mal seizures in July 1973 and this past week of December 20th to 22nd of 1973.
As responsible parents we have co-operated and given our b.est assistance to the Social Service Dept, and medical staff whenever possible for the management and care of Mark since he became a resident at WSSH. A part of this assistance was to give a conplete report of Mark’s history and our knowledge of his medical treatment prior to his admission. This history was given in writing and made available to the Social Service Dept., as well as the medical staff. In addition, special conferences were held with the Social Service and medical staff after his admission and again after the July episode of seizures to convey peritent information for the medical treatment of Mark.
After Mark’s episode of convulsive seizures in July, we inquired at various meetings with Social Service and medical staff for causes of repeated seizures. We^ were consistently getting incomplete information pertinent to Mark’s condition specifically in the area of drug usage, and the changing of drugs before a thorough analysis and evaluation was made with regards to his medical history. In addition, a severe gum condition had developed. This rnTormation was withheld from us and when we inquired inaccurate -information was given to us. After the drug program was changed, we were not imfoired that Mark was developing a pattern of seizures until he developed a grand mal seizure as a result.
It appears that the management of Mark’s treatment for his of mismanagement and
seizures' this past week is a reoccurence insufficient treatment for his condition similar to the which occured in July of this year.
Reconsidering all these past experiences we do not Mark is receiving the best medical and dental treatment is entitled to receive at WSSH.
We have received unsatisfactory answers from some of the medical staff when we inquire about the medical management given to Mark.

feel that that he
