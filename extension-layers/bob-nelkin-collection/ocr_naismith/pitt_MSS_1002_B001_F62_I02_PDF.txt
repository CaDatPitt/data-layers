Purpose of S.B. 94
In accordance with the modern trend toward the normalization of life for developmentally handicapped persons who would previously have been the victims of indiscriminate institutionalzation, small, homelike and comfortable community residential facilities appear now to offer to such persons substantial hope for happier and productive lives.
Organizations seeking to establish such residential facilities, however, have had to run a gauntlet of public protest from other residents of the various communities Involved, and the tool most often used to prevent the establishment of these much needed facilities Is tbc local zoning ordinance.
By refusing to recognize the residential nature of these facilities, also frequently called ‘’group homes,” local zoning commissions, other governmental units and Individuals have succeeded in limiting them to high density, institutional or even commercial surroundings.
The proposed bill will, If passed by the Pennsylvania legislature, purely and simply require local governments to consider group homes for eight or fewer developmentally handicapped persons to be residential uses for all zoning purposes.
At the same time, the bill will preserve the character of residential neighborhoods by preventing concentrations of facilities in any of such neighborhoods.
The bill is expansive in nature. That is, no organization in the mental health field will be limited by the bill in any manner. The bill can only open doors previously closed. It cannot close any door previously open. It is, therefore, essential that it be. passed.
The proposed bill was developed after thorough study of similar legislation in other states. All in all, it is the simplest and most straight forward bill we could devise for accomplishing its purpose. It has the prime characteristics of not requiring any financial appropriations and avoiding the need of additional bureaucracy.

REVEALS TREND Tf.U'APQS puuic acceptance of i:r persons IK CCXMUNITY
A Gallo.) Poll ccrj’.i ssioned by the President's Committee on Mental Retardation finds t'Mt most Americans express accepting attitudes toward their fellow citizens w-’O arc retarded, but some fear ard lack of confidence persists.
On the positive side, the poll found that 85*. would not object to six mildly or moderately retarded persons occupying a home on their block, and 91X would not object to having such a person employed where they work. (In the first case, the retarded persons were described as "educated to live in the general connunity," and in the second as a "trained worker.") The pell also revealed that 94 X thought that serie retarded people have to live in institutions, compared to IS who believed that all do.
On the negative side, 495 felt that most mentally retarded people are rot able to support themselves and lead independent lives, and 14X thought there is reason to fear rentally retarded people.
In testing people’s knowledge about the causes of retardation, the poll found t<>at 76'. believed that only sore forms of rental retardation are inherited, 21X didn't knew, and 35 said all forms are inherited.
In analyzing the responses, the Gallup Organization noted that the more the concept of special training is introduced, t!e more people are likely to accept retarded persons as fellow workers. Thus, while 14* think there is reason to fear mentally retarded people, only 5'1 would object to working with mildly or moderately retarded people who arc trained for the job.
It also points cut that although "it is almost universally recognized that institutionalization is not required for all mentally retarded people" only 331 think that rrost mentally retarded people are able to support themselves." The Committee has stated that most retarded adults can, with training, work in competitive employment and lead independent lives.
The Gallup Poll is part of the Committee's research for a report to the President cn the rational 'needs of mental retardation threugn the year 2020. It plans to submit the report in December 1975.
HOMES FOR RETARDED COST LESS
The cost of operating community-based living centers for the mentally retarded is declining, the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee said yesterday.
Under this program, retarded persons are taken out of mental institutions and placed in small group homes which ccme as close as possible to duplicating normal community living conditions.
I
In the 1973-74 fiscal year, the per-resident cost of operating the community living centers was $9,417. In 1975-76 this bad fallen to $7,300 per resident and is expected to total $6,300 in the 1976-77 fiscal year, the report said.
For those retarded persons housed in mental institutions, the report said, the annual per resident cost is estimated to be $10,652.
When the program began in the 1973-74 fiscal year, there were 879 persons in group homes and 10,587 persons in state mental health institutions.
But according to the report, the State Welfare Department predicts that, by the 1978-79 fiscal year, there will be 7,432 persons in group homes and 6,856 in state institutions.	■

EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY LIVING FACILITIES
Example, the Office of Mental Retardation reports that for the Mentally retarded alone, there are presently (as of August, 1977) 2,302 persons living in 125 community living settings across the state. An additional 2,201 individuals have moved from these arrangements to other living situations. Of these people, 987 graduated to fully independent living status and are nor tax payers instead of tax spenders. ' Savings to Pennsylvania taxpayers based on the $21,407.00 annual cost per institutionalized person, was $21,128,955.00.

PROPERTY VALUES
It has never been shown that real estate values drop or that panic selling occurs when a Community Living Facility is established in a given community. In fact, real estate values have increased. For example, in Allegheny County analyses of sales of residential property in neighborhoods with Community Living Facilities show such increases. Here are two examples from this report.
1.	Property "A". Was sold for $19,900 in May, 1972, before a CLF was established three doors away. In September, 1973 this same property sold for $22,295.
2.	Property "B." Was sold for $8,000 in September, 1970, before a CLF was established three doors away. In June, 1974, this same property sold for $17,000.
These examples were in different areas of the county. Further analyses of sales of all properties in the areas studied showed no panic-selling trend whatsoever.
