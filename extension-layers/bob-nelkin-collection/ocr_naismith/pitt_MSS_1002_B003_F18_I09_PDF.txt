Mr. Robert Hiltner, Superintendent western State School and Hospital 333 Curry Hill Road Canonsburg, Pa. 15317
Dear Bob,
Z am chasing an old idea called "An Hour Off*.
A year ago, at a Liaison Committee Meeting* Ginny and X proposed to you and WSSH staff an idea called •An Hour Off. The co icept of "An Hour Off* was to structure the child care aides (CCA) out of their maintenance and basic care routine for one hour per shift.
During "An Hour Off** the CCA’s supplemented by the unit social worker* recreation workers* volunteers and even possibly nurses would each lead a small group The staff member would find a quiet areas of the insti tution and organize Individual or group play for this group. One group might go to the visitor's room to listen to music* another group to the dining room to draw or paint* and another group to go on a walk. Ideally* no one would be left back on the unit during •An Hour Off".
We are still convinced that this program* "An Hour Off"* has various merits. And* we still would like to see this or a similar program instituted at Western State School and Hospital.
On a recent unannounced visit to Atk * we found that Polk has initiated a similar activity called •Activity Time". The CCA's who are programming in this time period* describe it as the most intearesting* rewarding period of the day.
If Polk can do it, it's hard to understand why Western cannot. Knowing many of the staff at Western, I am sure that if this program becomes available, it will be more sophisticated and more valuable than the current "Activity Time* at Polk.
A written response certainly isn't necessary. Xs there a possibility that this program, "An Hour Off*, can be planned at Western?
Thanks for listening.
Sincerely,
Robert Nelkin Associate Bxecutive Director
