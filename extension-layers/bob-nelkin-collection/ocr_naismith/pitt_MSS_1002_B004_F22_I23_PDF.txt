Madam Secretary:
Your recent statement to remove Dr. McClelland as Superintendent of Polk State School was without a coubt the most ignorant, irresponsible and stupid move ever made by an official of this State.
Dr. McClelland has served Polk State School for over twenty (20) years and has dedicated his life to that school and the people who reside there. To claim that he has allowed cruelty to exist in the school is totally unfounded. One visit to the school and you can make the decision to fire him!! My are’t we smart!1
Why haven’t you been there before? Why don’t you spend a week or a month with these people? Why don't you talk to the parents who have children in the school? Then you can make your decision and I'm sure it will not be the same - or is there political motivation!!
Sincerely,

Ralfch E. Silverthorn
