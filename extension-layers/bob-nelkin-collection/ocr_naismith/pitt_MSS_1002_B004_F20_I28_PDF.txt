am about the situation that you found on your recent visit to
Polk State School and hospital. It is heartening to know that

of the qualified? Imagine how long this has been going on AND made you-^re’

I’m with you 100$ on youre’ firing of the ’Br.’ Please continue yourezinterest in these areas. We must do something for thsee
