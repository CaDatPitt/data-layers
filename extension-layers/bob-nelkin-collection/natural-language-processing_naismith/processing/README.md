### Processing

This folder contains the notebook for the processing stage of the Bob Nelkin Collection. Processing involves manipulating the text into formats which may be of use to researchers and allows for greater analysis.  

The notebook contains the following sections:

1. Initial setup
2. Text cleaning
3. Tokenization
4. POS tagging and lemmatization
5. Spelling correction
6. Genre tagging
7. Wrap-up

#### Output

The output of this notebook is a pickle file of the processed dataframe called [`bob_df.pkl`](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/blob/master/extension-layers/bob-nelkin-collection/natural-language-processing_naismith/processing/bob_df.pkl). The dataframe contains the following columns:

column                     | description
:---                       | :---
id                         | unique id for each object, matching the ids found in the source-data and base-layers folders, e.g., _MSS_1002_B001_F11_I01_
title	                     | the title assigned to the object by the collection creators, e.g., _Recent Litigation Memo_
display_date               | the data the object was created, using the following format: _July 11, 1975_

depositor                  | the depositor of the object (same for all objects): _Detre Library & Archives, Heinz History Center_
collection_id              | internal collection_id number (same for all objects): _collection.341_

#### Notes  

In addition to the elements in the item level of the [CaD@Pitt Archival Collection Metadata Element Set](https://cadatpitt.github.io/documentation/data-dictionary/archival-collections.html#item-level) and data in the [Bob Nelkin Collection base layer](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/blob/master/base-layers/bob-nelkin-collection/bob-nelkin-collection_item-base-layer_archival.csv), this extension layer contributes the following elements and/or data:
- `text`
- `len`
- `tok_lem_POS_NLTK`
- `tok_lem_POS_CLAWS`
- `tok_lem_POS_NLTK_corrected`
- `misspelling_correction`
- `len_errors`
- `genre` (adds `genre` data missing in base layer)
- `genre_MODS` (adds `genre` data missing in base layer)
- `resource_type` (adds `type_of_resource` data missing in base layer)

As part of the processing, frequency data from an external corpus, [COCA](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/) (Davies, 2008-), is used. This data was accessed through a paid license.
