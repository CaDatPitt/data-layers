[Here reported: 12.822A Order (5pp.); 12,8223 Amicus Curiae Petition (10pp.); 12.822C Brief and Appendix of Amicus Curiae (40pp.).]\\nThe Department of the Public Advocate of the New Jersey Division of Mental Health Advocacy has filed an amicus brief in the New Jersey Supreme Court following the county’s appeal from an order (1) declaring an involuntary commitment order null and void for failure to hold a hearing as to mental illness. (2) establishing a procedure to be filed in future involuntary civil commitment hearings, and (3) making the appointment of independent counsel mandatory in all such hearings and providing for appointed counsel to\\nJUNE 1975\\n139\\nI u\\ni\\nI\\nI\\n\\nindigents. Amicus argues that the New Jersey Supreme Court should find that there is a constitutional as well as statutory right to counsel, and argues that counsel plays a critical role in the proceedings, and that an organized counsel service is preferable to assigned counsel because “organized counsel has proven to be more economical, more efficient, and more protective of constitutional rights than had been assigned counsel.’’ Amicus argues that since the state legislature has established the Division of Mental Health Advocacy to provide “such legal representation and medical consultation as the director deems appropriate for any indigent mental hospital admittee in any proceeding concerning the admit-tee’s admission to, retention in, or release from confinement in” a nientai institution, it is the appropriate agency to provide representation in all involuntary commitment proceedings should the court find a constitutional right to counsel.\\n/ .\\nCourt Orders State Department of Welfare to Pay the Per Diem Expenses for Severely Retarded Child Placed in a Foster Home\\n13.770.

Previously reported at 8 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 573 (Dec. 1974).)\\nIn a previous order, the court found that the only institution within the state capable of caring for a severely retarded 13-year-old girl was so grossly overcrowded and understaffed that such placement would be detrimental to the child, who had a constitutional right to treatment, and ordered the county Child Welfare Services Department and the county Mental Health/Mental Retardation Unit to cooperate in finding a foster home for the child. These departments found a suitable foster home for the child, but a disagreement arose between the county Child Services Department and the state welfare department as to who should pay the per diem costs paid to the foster parents. The court found that under the state Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act. the stat? welfare department is obligated to provide for citizens with mental disabilities and thus has the financial responsibility to meet the phvstcal needs ot the child. This includes any psychiatric and psychological work, rehabilitative training, shelter workshop services, transportation for the child to and from the location of such services, those drugs prescribed specifically for a mental disorder and general medical care, prosthetic appliances, special equipment and clothing.

Gotkin v. Miller, No. 74-2138 (2nd Cir., April 17, 1975). Appellant represented by Christopher Hansen, Mental Health Law Project, New York, N.Y. On the Brief. Bruce Ennis, New York Civil Liberties Union and Mental Health Law Project, New York, N.Y. [Here reported: 14.066A Opinion (10pp.).]\\nAppellant, a former mental patient who had contracted to write a book about her experiences, contacted three hospitals at which she had been a patient asking them to send her copies of her records so that she could verify her recollections of various incidents. The hospitals refused her request. Appellant claimed that this denial violated her first, fourth, ninth and fourteenth amendment rights. The lower court, granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment, held that former mental patients have no first amendment right to receive information contained in their hospital records; that the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures is inapplicable; that plaintiff enjoyed no right to privacy entitling her to her records for purposes of publishing a book; and that plaintiff had net been deprived of “liberty” or “property” protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\\nThe Second’ Circuit, affirming the lower court’s decision, found that existing case law regarding hospital records indicates that although patients have certain rights in their records, this right does not include an absolute property right with unrestricted access. Furthermore, New York statutory law establishes that while patients may exercise a considerable degree of control over their records, they do not have the right to demand direct access to them. As to appellant’s deprivation of liberty argument, the court found that appellant was not being stigmatized by the defendants and that no one had branded her as mentally ill or otherwise incompetent.\\nPost-Trial Brief Seeks Implementation of Minimum Treatment Standards or Closure of Ohio Mental Hospital\\n15,075.

Their brief covers all facets of patient life at the hospital, from diagnostic services to numbers and qualification of staff to payments to inmates for work performed. Plaintiffs request the court either to order the closing of the hospital or to order the implementation of the minimum treatment standards which they have discussed in the brief.\\n«■\\nCLEARINGHOUSE REVIEW\\nl.l. .\\t\\'.ti. /. a\\nDevelopmentally Disabled Residents of Intermediate Care Facilities Sue for Access to Day Care Services\\n15,190. Haney v. Parham, No. C 75-584A (N.D. Ga., filed March 28,. 1975). Plaintiffs represented by Thomas Affleck. 1706 Ellis St., Brunswick, Ga. 31530; Wayne Pressci, John Cromartie, Georgia Legal Services Programs. 15 Peachtree St., Atlanta. Ga. 30303. (404) 656-6021. [Here reported: 15.190A Complaint (17pp.).]\\nThis is a class suit tor declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of developmentally disabled individuals who reside in intermediate care facilities in Georgia and are recipients of Medicaid benefits. Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to social services, including day care sevices, and they challenge the state defendants’ policy of denying them access to and continued participation at state training centers in day care services, which are not furnisha’oie in defendants\\' intermediate care facilities, but were previously furnished through inter-agency agreement. Further, they challenge the federal defendants’ policy of denying reimbursement for individuals in need of such services not furnishable in the resident intermediate care facilities who are either seeking entry into the day care services programs or are participating currently in such services. They claim that this denial of funds violates the federal defendants’ obligations to participate financially in the services outlined in 45 C.F.R. §§222.55-60.\\nSeventh Circuit Orders Convening of Three-Judge Court to Determine Constitutionality of Portion of • the Illinois Menial Health Code Which Requires Children of Indigent Patients to Pay for Their Parents\\' Support\\n15,277. Wojcik v. Levitt. No. 74-1661 (7th Cir., April 9, 1975). Plaintiff represented by Thomas Grippando, Chicago Legal Aid Bureau, 64 E. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Ill. 60604, (312) 922-5625; Chester Lizak, 7 S. Dearborn St., Chicago, III. [Here reported: 15.277A Opinion (8pp.).]\\nPlaintiff brought this action challenging Section 12-12 of the Illinois Mental Health Code which provides that children of indigent parents who are receiving treatment from the Department of Mental Health must pay up to 550 per month for the support of such parent. He argues that the requirement that children of public assistance recipients make contributions to their parent’s support was abolished in 1967 and that to single out only the children of indigent mental patients as legally responsible relatives is a denial of equal protection. The district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint, concluding that plaintiffs attacks on the constitutionality of Section 12-12 were “obviously without merit.’’\\nThe Seventh Circuit reversed the lower court’s decision and found that plaintiffs challenge cannot be termed “wholly insubstantial” or “obviously frivolous.” Although the court stated that it did not wish to suggest that a rational explanation for the apparent discrimination does not exist, it noted that no explanation is clear upon the face of the statutes involved, and defendant\\'s counsel did not provide one. The court found that at least one of plaintiffs constitutional arguments has sufficient substance to meet the standards set forth in Gooihy v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, and that therefore,\\nthe lower court erred in not convening a three-judge cr^rt pursuant to 23 U.S.C. §2281.\\nMIGRANT LAW\\nAttorney Arrested for Consulting With Clients at Migrant Labor Camp Awarded 56,000 Damages; Court Enjoins Defendants from Denying Access to Counsel\\n6163.

Previously reported at 8 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 640 (Jan. 1975).[\\nThe court found no merit to the argument of the City of New York that, since it has closed the Manhattan House of Detention (The Tombs), the court has no power to grant relief to the plaintiffs who were originally housed there but have been relocated to the Rikers Island House of Detention for Men, or that a trial de novo must be held. It noted that the Second Circuit had affirmed its earlier decision, which not only made findings of fact as to conditions at the Tombs but also determined the standards of protection to which detainees are entitled. Further, the Second Circuit, although probably not contemplating the closing of the Tombs, stated that, given the tortuous history of the litigation, \"the district judge should not allow another trial on the merits of plaintiffs’ claim or countenance any significant delay in fashioning',\n",

As a group we have written letters to Mr. Beal, Mr. Jenkins and Mrs. Calloway expressing our desire to see this unit opened, but have received no other response than that the matter is under consideration.\\nIt has recently come to the attention of our group that there are several residents who are posing a real problem for the workers at the center. I was informed last week about an incident where one of the residents, in a fit of anger, literally ripped a door of its hinges and where another resident started a fight and hit another tesident. We are afraid that serious physical harm may come to our relatives if these few are allowed to remain at Southwest Habilitation Center.\\nI am soliciting your help in possibly advising us what action our group should take to demand that either the third floor be opened to house these residents or that they be transferred someplace where they can be properly cared for.\\nOur next meeting will be on Sunday, August 8th at 3:00 at the Center and I am requesting that you attend.

The quality of the\\nzerox copy, which I received, gave me my first indication of the type of\\nreport that I was about to read. It is, without a doubt, the most vicious\\nattack that I have witnessed on an institution and its employees and particu-\\nlarly its Superintendent. Since you, yourself, have removed the kid gloves\\nfrom this discussion, I will continue in the same vein.\\n\\nIt\\'s obvious from the beginning remarks that you make that you are mis-\\ntrustful of this institution. You challenge Dr. McClelland\\'s trustfulness\\nin regard to knowing beforehand of your visit. In the fourth paragraph of\\nyour report, you wondered if the single rooms were used as a reward or for\\nspying on the girls. I think a report, such as you made, should confine\\nitself to observations and not your own psychological.hang ups. Ybur constant\\ninnuendos betray not so much the inadequacies of this institution as they do\\nyour own. On the second page, under the title of \"Food Services\", I find\\nit incongruous that-you mentioned that the girls who were eating did not try\\nto talk to you. This is a difficult project, to talk while you are eating,\\nespecially, when no one stops to talk to you. Your concern for the welfare\\nof the retarded was nowhere in evidence on the day of your visitation. In-\\nstead, there was an attempt to avoid any conversation with the residents,\\nespecially, those with severe physical handicaps. You questioned dining\\nroom attendants as to the service that they were offering, \"to help, to watch,\\nto keep order?\" Since you raise a question, permit me to respond. Yes, the\\nemployees were there to help. They are there to watch. They are there to\\nkeep order. That is their job.\\n\\nUnder the title of \"Sunnyside\", you, again through innuendo, cast GSpwr-\\nsions about the treatment of the residents in this building. You say \"name\\nhad scratches or bruises\". Yet, in the same cottage you raised the question\\nabout \"large wooden enclosures of wooden slats placed close together and\\nabout 5 feet high\". As we explained to you at that time, these enclosures\\nwere used to confine disturbed residents, instead of placing them in a\\nstrait jacket for restraint; it was felt that it is more humane to allow iﬁcn\\nfreedom of movement and at the same time protect other residents from the\\nbruises and scratches that you have calls; attention to. These enclosures\\nwere designed by Dr. Sidney Kaplan many years ago so that the restraining\\njackets would not have to be used.\\n\\ncon\\'t.\\n\\nFRED J.

As part of my professional duties, I work with\\nthe intermediate units in which Selinsgrove, Laurelton, White Haven\\nand Polk are located. On many occasions, I have.visited all of these\\nfacilities. During these visits I was very impressed with what I saw,\\nwith the exception of Polk. It bewildered me to see such lackadaisical\\nand crude treatment of patients. I could not understand why the other\\nfacilities I visited are able to do so much more with the same types\\nof residents. Certainly there must be more to it than the newness of\\n\\nthe physical plant or the ability level of the residents.\\n\\nThe change of attitudes and actions will certainly be necessary\\nif Polk is to achieve the same high standards of the other facilities\\nwhich I have visited. Through your brave actions, this change has begun.\\n\\n,May I applaud you for your willingness to cause a turnabout in what so\\n\\noften seems to be a never-ending, self—perpetuating situation. Xou\\nwere courageous enough to take a stand and to fight to improve a most\\ninhumane treatment of those who cannot fight for themselves.\\n\\nVery truly yours,\\n\\n/3.2./%ﬂ7\\n\\nLouis G.

He is unable to tell anyone then\\nsomeone hurts him and there are so many to match,\\nit is absolutely necessary that the violent ones\\nbe restrained some way and the cages sound ruch\\nmore pleasant than a room in which the person can\\'t\\neven.see the others or be near them; also better\\nthan restraining belts and jackets etc.\\nThe real fault is§with»our unrealistic society\\nthat forces existence on those poor creatures who\\n’ q’t reall\\n\\n     \\n  \\n\\nliving. - .\\n\\' Yours very\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n.\\\\\\n” L‘ «.4c’2”’s\";3E;4e. _\\nu 5 . &.

Shapp\\nGovernor _\\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania\\nState Capitol\\n\\nHarrisburg, Pa. 17120\\n\\nDear Governor Shapp:\\n\\nWe are aware of the situation which has developed recently at Polk\\nState School,and it was discussed by our Executive Comittee yesterday.\\nWithout commenting at all about the process by which this situation was\\n\\n- handled by the Department of Public Welfare, we want to express our complete\\n\\nagreement with the view that restraints such as the pens and cages used at\\nPolk are incompatible with modern and humane treatment methods and should\\nbe forbidden at all institutions for the mentally disabled.\\n\\nThere is no evidence whatever that mentally disabled persons are more\\ninclined toward assaultive or violent behavior than are any other persons\\nor groups.\\n\\nFurthermore, we think that the use of such restraints illustrates the\\nneed for continuing public awareness and for action with respect to the\\nconditions in Pennsylvania\\'s institutions.\\n\\nStaff must be attuned to humane treatment and to the primary goal of\\nstrengthening the individual patient\\'s capacity to reenter society. A\\ncustodial or \"warehouse\" approach is not acceptable.\\n\\nPMH is categorically opposed to inhumane methods of care and to the\\nconcept of permanent institutionalization of people. We urge you to ensure\\nthat all institutional treatment be mandated to further the patient\\'s earliest\\nrelease to a community facility and to support much needed development of\\ncommunity services. ‘\\n\\nOur major efforts are toward replacement of institutions by local\\nfacilities or integrating them into comunity—based programs. So long as\\ninstitutions do exist we will not abandon our concern that humane and appropriate\\ncare be afforded those who still remain within their walls. ‘\\n\\nServing 38 Community Menial Healih Associations 0 Division, National Association for MeniaI_He»:I9h,.In_c. f\\n\\n_V V_ r. _  ,,_,__.___,__,. ., .._. »»-~-———-—v~~\\n\\nPENNSYLVANIA LVIEDICAL SOCIETY PRESIDENT\\n\\nRobert S.

Our\\nSociety pledges its cooperation in such an effort.\\n\\nThe state administration and legislature should partici-\\npate in, but not dominate, a general investigation led by a\\nnational figure with an unquestioned reputation for objectivity.\\nAs additional participants we suggest representatives of the\\ngeneral public, private mental health and mental retardation\\ngroups and leading professionals in the mental health/mental\\nretardation fields. -\\n\\nThe information currently available to us indicates\\nthat Dr. James H. Mcclelland, the former superintendent of\\nPolk State Hospital, is a victim of the state\\'s difficulty in\\nestablishing and administering practical uniform guidelines\\nwith adequate funding in the mental health/mental retardation\\narea. In addition, the emotionalism surrounding the dismissal\\nof Dr. Mcclelland tends to obscure the real issue -- the\\nquality of all of the care and services provided by the state\\n\\n(continued)\\n\\nThe Honorable Milton J. Shapp . May 8, 1973\\nGovernor of Pennsylvania Page 2\\n\\nto the mentally ill and mentally retarded. The general investi-\\ngation we recommend should be authorized promptly under auspices\\nthat would avoid any political stigma. Political or personality\\nissues dare not be involved in anything so serious as assessing\\nthe quality of care and services provided to the retarded and\\nmentally ill.\\n\\nThe issue is not the use of restraining enclosures for those\\npatients whose periodic violence to themselves and to others can-\\nnot be controlled adequately by drugs. The real issue is the\\ntotal quality of care the state provides and this needs to be\\nimpartially assessed and made public so that facts and not\\nemotionalism will be the basis for action.\\n\\nThe general study we recommend is sorely needed and we call\\nupon State Government to authorize it as promptly as possible.\\nWe pledge our support for such a move and our willingness to parti-\\ncipate in it.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nRobert S.

After working with such people, however, I came\\n\\nto the conclusion that if they were properly used such de-\\n\\nvices were far and away the most humane, for all concerned.\\n\\nIf your child was assaulted by an‘ungovernable peer in such\\n\\nan institution, you would want the ungovernable child restrained.\\nIf your child was so destructive, you would hope that he could\\nbe retrained...and filling the child full of tranquillizers,\\nisolating him entirely from others, or physically punishing him\\njust doesn\\'t retrain him properly.\\n\\nI don\\'t know Dr. Mcclelland, but it is certainly rare for both\\nstaff and patients to express such regard for the person at\\nthe top of an institution of this sort. It is a thankless\\njob, at best. I saw many idealistic programs start, and fade\\naway due to lack of money, understanding, cooperation, unity\\nof staff purpose, education, etc. This in turn made many\\nvery good people quit in despair...everyone needs to see the\\nresults of their labors in some way, and when you deal with\\nthe retarded, you do not get thanks from them, as you might\\nif you were a medical doctor who cured you of a painful ail-\\nment.\\n\\nIt was my conclusion that both restraint and retraining were\\nequally needed in such institutions; But you can get surprises.\\nIn one institution for delinquents that I worked in, an \"iso-\\nlation cell\" was kept as a \"last resort\" for inmates who failed\\nto cooperate and appreciate the relatively open program. Within\\ntwo weeks of opening the facility, we had to create two more of\\nthese cells because the boys begged to go in them to protect\\nthem from the more aggressive inmates who assaulted and raped\\nthe new boys as they arrived if they refused to \"cooperate\" and,\\n\"submit\" to their demands! So you have to really understand‘the\\nsituation before you jump to conclusions. An institution is NOT\\nlike an open society, and it never can be. \\' \\'\\n\\nWith best wishes for your success. I\\'m sure you are deeply\\ndedicated to improving a sad situation. Sincerely,\\n\\n- r’ \\'7 .\\n\\\\ ...  . —\\' . \\' -u m\\n)J/,;KL;~\\\\,¢W_WW) Ms. Dorsey de R81:WP~\\n\\n'}"
