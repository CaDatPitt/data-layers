Dear Mr. Polloni
I am sure you will recall our first meeting on November 21, 1977. On that date I met you and Mr. Carl Elser, Director, Bureau of Institutional Programs, Department of Public Welfare, et the Pittsburgh airport and drove you to Western Center for a trustees* meeting. During our trip, I described to both of you the terrible condition of the residents* mouths at Western Center. I talked about how the residents were being neglected, and therefore abused, as a result of the lack of professional . •, dental care. This fact was later confirmed by Mr. Elser at an* other meeting. While you were meeting with the board, I had the opportunity to show Mr. Elser approximately 50 slides of mouth| .of different residents at Western. These slides demonstrated lack of professional cleaning as well as the presence of T-any \:•* f decayed and broken-down teeth which, over a period of yeitrs, hod been allowed to rot in the residents’ mouths. These areas o
gross destruction clearly represented areas of chronic infecttohf?" . both past and present. It 1s not the purpose of this lettertp-. * describe the pathologic process of Infection and the effects 1V Ms oq people. I am comfortable that you are aware of the sequences of dental pain and Infection and how 1t can affect appetites, seizure disorders, and the behavior of pdf very 
*•' I also told Mr. Elser of communications I had had with Dr. Ralph Rusynyk, Olrector, Division of Institutional Pental Services, Pennsylvania Department of Health. Dr. Rusynyk had repeatedly told me of how he was aware of dental conditions in the houths of residents at other state centers which he had visited, which were by his own description, "as bad or worse" than those at Western.
