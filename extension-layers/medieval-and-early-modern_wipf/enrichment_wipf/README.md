This extension layer contributes enrichments to the [base layer](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/blob/master/base-layers/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf_item-base-layer_monograph-catalog.csv) of the [Medieval and Early Modern Facsimiles and Original Materials at the University of Pittsburgh](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/tree/master/base-layers/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf) collection. There are two datasets in this extension layer: the [medical dataset](#medical-dataset), which describes 590 of the 1,239 items in the collection, and the [nonmedical dataset](#nonmedical-dataset), which describes 520 items.

### Medical dataset
The [medical](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/tree/master/extension-layers/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf/enrichment_wipf/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf_medical_enrichment.csv) dataset includes data that standardizes or supplements values for the `publication_place`, `language`, and `publication_date` elements. Empty and pre-existing values for these three elements have been replaced with more accurate and consistent data. Data for the other 25 elements remain the same. See the [About the Data](#about-the-data) section for more information.

### Nonmedical dataset
The [nonmedical](https://github.com/CaDatPitt/data-layers/tree/master/extension-layers/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf/enrichment_wipf/medieval-and-early-modern_wipf_nonmedical_enrichment.csv) dataset includes data that standardizes or supplements values for the `language`, `geographic_coverage`, and `temporal_coverage` elements. Empty and pre-existing values for these three elements have been replaced with more accurate and consistent data. Data for the other 25 elements remain the same. See the [About the data](#about-the-data) section for more information.

### About the data
In addition to the definitions and descriptions for [item level elements](https://cadatpitt.github.io/documentation/data-dictionary/monograph-collections.html#item-level) in the [Monograph Collection Metadata Element Set](https://cadatpitt.github.io/documentation/data-dictionary/monograph-collections.html) section of the [CaD@Pitt Data Dictionary](https://cadatpitt.github.io/documentation/04-data-dictionary), this extension layer includes the following controlled vocabulary terms:

- **unknown**—used when information is unknown for items that are not compendia (i.e., one discrete object) or when information is unknown to scholars in general

- **various**—used when available metadata for items indicate that there should be multiple values but does not include specific enough information to list them exhaustively; typically used for compendia
