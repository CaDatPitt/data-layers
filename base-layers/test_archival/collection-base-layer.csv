(spusa), the communist party of the u.s. (cpusa), and the students for a democratic society (sds). founded 1901 with remnants still in existence today, spusa reached a peak membership of about 120,000 around the 1912 election when it polled 6% of the presidential vote. the party declined sharply after 1919 from a combination of government repression, a split between reformists and revolutionaries crystallized by the bolshevik revolution, and the effects of social change on their core constituencies and on the credibility of their hopes for imminent change; role of the left in modern u.s. history; sds began as the student wing of the league for industrial democracy (originally an organization of socialist college students that evolved into a social-democratic policy group of intellectuals and union functionaries). they parted company with the parent organization over vietnam and anticommunism in the early 1960s, and expanded rapidly during the 1960s as the most visible american exponents of the new left. in contrast to the old left parties, sds did not collect monthly dues or keep systematic membership records, so estimates of its membership vary widely, but at its peak in 1968-69 probably several hundred thousand people identified themselves at least loosely with sds; the left","dr. richard oestreicher, associate professor of history at the university of pittsburgh, amassed the american left ephemera collection over a 35-year period to document the history of the american left from the 1870s to the present. digital reproductions of the collection are available online","anarchism -- united states -- history -- sources; buttons (information artifacts); christian socialism -- united states -- history -- sources; communism -- united states -- history -- sources; communist party of the united states of america. -- history -- sources; labor -- united states -- history -- sources; minorities -- political activity -- united states -- sources; new left -- united states -- history -- sources; pamphlets; photographs; politics; posters; radicalism -- united states -- history -- 20th century -- sources; social action; socialism -- united states -- history -- sources; socialist labor party. -- history -- sources; socialist party (u.s.). -- history -- sources; socialist workers party. -- history -- sources; student peace union (u.s.). -- history -- sources; students for a democratic society (u.s.). -- history -- sources; utopian socialism -- united states -- history -- sources; vietnam war, 1961-1975","a.e. forbes communist collection, 1921-1972, ais.2000.07, archives & special collections, university of pittsburgh library system",uls archives & special collections,"american left ephemera collection, 1875-2015, ais.2007.11, archives & special collections, university of pittsburgh library system","the university of pittsburgh holds the property rights to the material in this collection, but the copyright may still be held by the original creator/author. researchers are therefore advised to follow the regulations set forth in the u.s. copyright code when publishing, quoting, or reproducing material from this collection without the consent of the creator/author or that go beyond what is allowed by fair use"
