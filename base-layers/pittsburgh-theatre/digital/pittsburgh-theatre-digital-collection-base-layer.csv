The collection is of particular interest because it represents an almost complete record of the George Sharp Players, by far the best and most durable of Pittsburgh's stock companies.|||The George Sharp Players enjoyed five consecutive seasons in Pittsburgh from 1927 to 1931, offering the typical stock company bill -- melodrama, light comedy, mystery, and farce. Among performers who went on to national stardom are Paul McGrath, Alexander Kirkland, Ralph Morgan, Anne Forrest, and Ann Harding. Leading lady Ann Harding, with her husband, Harry Bannister, broke away in 1928 to form a rival company, the Nixon Players, taking their name from the theatre in which they played; the company lasted only one season. The George Sharp Players performed at the Pitt Shubert until their final month in 1931 at the Pitt Alvin. Similar to other stock companies throughout the country, the George Sharp Players were forced to close because of the increasing popularity of motion pictures.|||George Sharp returned to Pittsburgh for a brief season late in 1932, to manage the Edwin Vail Players, which then changed its name to the George Sharp Players.

documenting Pittsburgh and New York performing arts history. For the most part, the materials date from before the 1870s through the early 1940s. About ninety percent of the contents of the collection relate to Pittsburgh theatre history and the remainder relating to New York City Broadway productions. Mr. Merriman had a very specific arrangement for the majority of the collection. Other than the scrapbooks being disbound and foldered, the collection has remained in that order. The materials are mounted in a series of nearly identical scrapbooks. With few exceptions, they measure 15 by 10 inches. The scrapbook's paper is still in good condition. The clippings from the 1930s and 1940s are brittle and have not held up as well as the earlier materials. The collection is arranged into seven series. The bulk of the collection is contained in the first two series: ""Lettered"" and ""Numbered"" scrapbooks. A selection of the original covers of the scrapbooks were kept and are stored in the last box of the collection.","Oliver P. Merriman, 1866-1942, was a theater enthusiast who solicited materials and compiled a comprehensive and well organized collection of over 160 scrapbooks. The vast majority of these scrapbooks documented nearly a century of the performing arts in Pittsburgh. Mr. Merriman enjoyed a long career in the real estate department of Mellon Bank. He and his wife, the former Mary Louise Vogel, lived in the East End of the city and attended many of the productions documented in these scrapbooks. Merriman befriended theatre managers to help him collect programs for the performances that he could not attend and was also able to obtain programs from productions dating back to before the Civil War. ""I collected them, but how and when and where I started I do not know. You know how you collect anything. You first throw it into a box. Bye and bye the box gets full and you realize that you are going to have to arrange the contents in some order."" (Interview with Marie M'Swigan, Pittsburgh Press, January 12, 1930)|||For about 20 years the Merriman scrapbooks were stored at the Allegheny Branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, until they were gifted to Dr. Ford E. Curtis in 1964.","Oliver P. Merriman was an avid follower of Pittsburgh theatre. He built a large scrapbook collection that documents the history of the performing arts in Pittsburgh from the 1870s through the 1930s.

Each play would be performed between three to six times. Some performances were reserved for University of Pittsburgh students and faculty only. Occasionally, they would perform matinees for area high school students. Productions were halted during World War I, in part due to Baird's enlistment in the service. Pitt Players resumed in 1919 under the direction of Reginald Johnson. Starting in the 1930s, one or two additional productions were offered during the summer. Harvey J.

When the Cap and Gown Club was disbanded in 1948, the Pitt Players began to incorporate the musical comedies that made the Cap and Gown Club so popular.

This group was officially dissolved in 1978. All Cap and Gown productions were written and produced by Pitt undergraduates and alumni. Only undergraduates made up the casts and chorus. Gene Kelly, CAS ’33, was an undergraduate member, and served as the Club’s dance director for several years after graduating. Regis Toomey, ’21, was another member who went on to a successful theatrical career. The Cap and Gown Club also produced two songs that became University standards, “Hail to Pitt” (from 1910's Here and There) and the “Pitt Victory Song” (from 1938's Pickets Please).","The University of Pittsburgh's Cap and Gown Club was an all male organization that annually wrote and produced a varsity musical comedy show.

Also included are scrapbooks documenting the activities of Irene Kaufmann Settlement, Children's Civic Theatre Society, Pittsburgh Civic Playhouse, Snatched From the Noose: A Melodrama (Fort Pitt Hotel, 1936), Pittsburgh Little Theatre, and Pittsburgh Summer Playhouse.","The Pittsburgh Playhouse, a community theatre company, was created to fill the desire for a resident theatre left behind by the collapse of commercial venues. Motion pictures impacted live theater and forced stock companies and other theatre companies to lose their grip on the Depression Era's rare entertainment dollar. Pittsburgh's stock companies, like the George Sharp Players (Shubert and Alvin Theatres, 1927-31) or the Nixon Players (Nixon Theatre) featured a diverse fare of light comedies, farce, melodramas, and mystery but still could not meet the tastes, prices, or choices available in films. The only options remaining were the large-scale touring companies (also a dwindling possibility with the conversion of the Alvin to a motion picture format in 1932), burlesque or small local ventures. Despite attempts by the Pittsburgh Civic Playhouse, Pittsburgh Summer Theatre, and other theatre groups, little opportunity existed for Pittsburgh's residents to create and produce theatre outside the university setting.|||In 1934, a group of civic leaders joined forces to form a resident community theatre -- The Pittsburgh Playhouse Association. The financial and artistic stability provided by an affluent Executive board which was complemented by an Advisory committee (including local theatre professionals), gave the new venture a strong foundation and a community impulse from which to start. The new community theatre was contributing to civic culture and developing the talents of avocational actors. The first production, Art and Mrs. Bottle, opened in a borrowed auditorium at the Frick School and rented equipment on December 10, 1934, to social fanfare and mixed reviews. Despite a lack of permanent home and financial hard times, the recipe for a long-lived institution had been established -- wealthy patrons, knowledgeable artistic guidance and popular appeal. By the second Season in 1935, a part-time Artistic Director was replaced with a full-time position and a permanent home in the Hamlet Theater on Craft Avenue was renovated and available. Despite a briefly lived (1935-37) movement away from semi-professionals toward a professional company under its first Director, Herbert Gellendre, the organization remained committed to a semi-professional, community theater under its next Director, Fred Burleigh, for the next thirty years.|||Although briefly interrupted by World War II, the Playhouse offered a varied and popular fare under Mr. Burleigh's leadership. The expanding cultural and social center was complete with a restaurant offering meals and entertainment both prior and post performances for the membership. The greatest era of growth occurred in the late 1940's with the addition of the school and children's theater. In 1947 the Playhouse began offering classes in all aspects of the theatre, formalizing the Playhouse tradition of hands-on learning. The school offered a full-time curriculum including stage techniques, radio acting, and other subjects related to theatre taught by instructors that included Edith Skinner, Shirley Jones, Sada Thompson, George Peppard, Charles Grodin, and local personalities like Helen Wayne Rauh. The second important component was the addition of a children's theatre. In 1949, Fred Burleigh approached staff member, William Leech, to organize the Playhouse Junior. Mr. Leech quickly found success with the shared use of the available acting and production talents and the development of original scripts, mostly from extant sources. Both elements reflected and enhanced the Playhouse's local reputation for quality theatre.|||The period of growth continued into the 1950's and included the addition of two theatres (Craft Avenue in 1952 and Theatre Upstairs in 1958). This growth, supported by box office sales and private donations, lead to ambitious thoughts of professionalism. Unfortunately, by the early 1960's, the recent expansions and size of the organization, as well as waning public interest caused an increasing amount of fiscal distress. The decision was made to enter into a joint venture with Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University) to help regain a somewhat tarnished reputation and fulfill the goal of creating a first rate professional theater. In 1965, William Ball formed a professional company called The American Conservatory Theater which resided at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. After a somewhat successful, albeit short, six month season, Mr. Ball and the Pittsburgh Playhouse parted company. The American Conservatory Theater A.C.T. thereafter settled in San Francisco and remains a major regional company and training ground. In order to further the goal of professionalizing the theater, the Pittsburgh Playhouse introduced John Hancock as the Director during the 1966-1967 season. The intellectual style of Mr. Hancock's theater, although of respectable quality, was met with disinterest by an audience weaned on light comedy and musical revues. Mr. Hancock quickly moved on.|||By the late 1960's the Pittsburgh Playhouse was financially strapped and still unsuccessful in meeting the goal of professionalization. Collaboration with Point Park College managed to keep the doors to the Pittsburgh Playhouse open for a few more years and during this time the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and the American Dance Ensemble were formed, but even that arrangement proved unworkable. The Executive Committee voted to disband and close the Pittsburgh Playhouse complex in 1973. The joint venture with Point Park College was unable to sustain the distressed institution, however; Point Park acquired the Pittsburgh Playhouse facilities to expand their performing arts departments. From 1974 to the 1990's, Point Park continued the Playhouse tradition of performing arts education and until recently maintained the film repertory, children's theatre and the small professional company. Due to financial constraints, Point Park College discontinued the film series and severely curtailed the children's and professional companies.","This collection consists of the records of the Pittsburgh Playhouse School of the Theater, including operational files, business records, correspondence, press clippings, photographs, negatives, scripts, programs, posters, scrapbooks, press releases, and brochures.

After graduating from high school, Edith moved to the United States and began working at the Beechwood School for Girls in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. In 1923, she graduated from the Leland Powers School for the Spoken Word in Boston. During her time there, she met Margaret Prendergast McLean, disciple of phonetician William Tilly. Consequently, she became a student of Tilly's and his assistant in 1926. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia in 1930 and 1931.|||Beginning in 1928, Margaret Hewes (Edith's sister) produced professional summer seasons at the Wharf Theatre in Provincetown, Massachusetts where Skinner coached the company. After 1930, she also instructed apprentices in a full-scale training program - one of the first models for actor-training efforts within a professional company in the United States. In 1935 Hewes turned over control of the Wharf theatre to Skinner. During her tenure as producing director the training program expanded and they produced an acclaimed revival of Ah Wilderness!, starring Sinclair Lewis.|||In 1937, Skinner joined the faculty of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While at Carnegie Institute of Technology, her teaching affected a generation of actors and their training, including William Ball and Ellis Raab. During her tenure at Carnegie Institute of Technology, she also continued her professional coaching work at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and later throughout the country as former student actors and directors required her skills.|||She served as a speech consultant for William Ball's American Conservatory Theatre in 1965, during its' one season in Pittsburgh, before it relocated to San Francisco.

In 1964 a permanent home for the company was established--the first such permanent home for a puppet theatre company in the United States. Located at 5888.5 Ellsworth Avenue in Pittsburgh’s Shadyside neighborhood, this professional puppet theater specialized in performing their own adaptations of classic and folk tales as well as their own original stories for both children and adults. They also pioneered the experimental theatre programs of Jean Cocteau, Jean Giraudoux and Moliere using rod puppets and Japanese-style bunraku figures. Having outgrown its facilities on Ellsworth Avenue, in 1977 they shifted the stage to the Carnegie Museum of Art Theater offering a full subscription season of puppet theater. The Theatre collaborated with New York-based Mabou Mines--training their actors on the use of bunraku figures; Pittsburgh’s Ironclad Agreement Theatre Co.--on the American Premiere of Gov't Owned Apples; and the Pittsburgh Public Theatre--in a 1978 production of Balyasnikov. Other noteworthy performances have included a 3-week residency at the Smithsonian Institute; selection by Theatre Association of Pennsylvania (1977 - 1981) for an annual showcase of Pennsylvania's finest professional theatre; at the Union Internationale de la Marionette Festival Mondial in France and the Three Rivers Arts Festivals.|||Among its other activities, the Lovelace Marionette Theatre Company also provided training and apprentice programs for young people, including the noted American theatre director, Peter Sellars. They developed a cultural enrichment program in 1970 for Pittsburgh Public Schools eventually expanding to 145 schools in Western Pennsylvania. Instruction has played a major role in its activities. The company developed a residency program in which students spend time in workshops learning about all aspects of puppet theater in a direct hands-on approach. Also offered were workshops for teachers to learn puppetry skills for integration into the classroom. The regular staff of LMT Co. has included David Visser, Heather Mathieson and Pamela Zarra. The creative driving force behind this venture has been its founder Margo Lovelace Visser. She studied at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), and with Cedric Head's Kingsland Marionettes, the German puppeteer--Erhard Reis, and Moscow's Central Puppet Theatre (Lovelace Puppets have been on displayed in the museum from 1966-1981) at the request of Sergei Obraztsov. She has also traveled widely exploring puppet theaters around the world and collecting masks and puppets. Her collection is presently on deposit with the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. Ms. Lovelace was an active member of the American Marionettes Council, the Union Internationale de la Marionette, a member of committees for both Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. She produced a short subject film in 1978, Museum Piece, which was nominated for an Academy Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Other awards include a bronze medal from the Union Internationale de la Marionette, a finalist in the American Film Festival and a Golden Eagle Award for another Film, The Puppet Proposition. In 1981 she was awarded the Theodore A. Hazlett Governor's Award for Excellence in the Theatre Arts.|||During the last years of the Lovelace Marionette Theatre Company an umbrella organization, The Marionette Theatre Arts Council, was formed to administer the Lovelace Theatre programs as well as providing educational opportunities and cultural enrichment through the medium of puppet theatre.

Throughout his career, he associated himself with many legendary performers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. He was born in Montreal, Canada on June 12, 1878 and moved with his family to Boston in 1893. Row attended Tufts College in Massachusetts from 1897 to 1901, majoring in English, with the intention of becoming a writer. During college, he decided instead to become an actor and applied to Boston's Castle Square Theatre Stock Company.|||Row achieved his first major production role in 1899 in Minnie Maddern Fiske's Becky Sharp. From that point forward, he was heavily involved with the theatre and performed with the Barrymores, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Otis Skinner, and in more modern productions such as Orson Welles' 1937 production of Julius Caesar, and A Streetcar Named Desire with Uta Hagen. In 1919, Row helped found the Afternoon Theatre and produced several plays, most notably Aglavaine and Selysette starring Eva Le Gallienne.|||Arthur Row's association with Sarah Bernhardt began in 1913 when he wrote an article about her for The New Age. Bernhardt enjoyed the piece and invited Row to meet her. Three years later, Bernhardt's manager William F. Connor asked Row to be the press representative for Madame Sarah's 1916-17 'Farewell' American tour. He published a great many articles about her and continued to do so after the tour was finished. He wrote a series called 'Memories of Sarah Bernhardt' for The Younger Set magazine and in the late 1940's wrote a book titled Sarah The Divine.|||Arthur Row died in 1961.|||For more detailed information about Row, consult: Personal file of Arthur Row clippings.

Barbara was sent to Paris after graduation to study voice, piano, and language for several years. Upon leaving Europe, she traveled extensively on freighters throughout the south and central Pacific, as well as Asia. In addition to her musical talents, Bogart was a prolific writer. During her life she authored many plays, poems, two unpublished novels, short stories, and a weekly series of travel articles for the Russian River News.

Anthony LoCicero and Barbara Bogart were married in San Francisco in 1942, and continued their work in The Drunkard.|||The Drunkard was a comical adaptation of the Victorian temperance melodrama, Ten Nights in a Barroom. Barbara wrote the music for this production, and also included various additions and revisions to the script. Her principal role was that of Mary Wilson, the play's heroine, while Anthony generally played the villain of the piece and also became the show's producer. The show ran in San Francisco throughout the war years and then was taken on the road throughout California and the West. It was an unqualified success breaking records in many cities for the number of weeks that it ran. Advertisers billed it as a ""3 Hour Laff Riot"", and the performers played up the melodrama, actively encouraging audience participation. Even the advertisements urged viewers to ""Hiss the Villain!"" In addition, sandwiches, snacks, and beer were often served at performances. An olio of various vaudeville and burlesque skits accompanied the main production.|||The Drunkard's popularity had dimmed by the 1960's, but Anthony remained in show business and performed frequent stints as the straight man in comedy acts. Barbara would occasionally sell tickets at whichever theatre Tony was performing, but had primarily returned to her writing.

The second series consists of twelve scrapbooks that contain newspaper clippings and photographs from the period of 1950 to 1986. Some of the newspaper clippings, photographs, and programs are duplicated in the two series. Other times there is only information on a given year or production in one of the series and not the other.","The Sherwood Forest Theatre was founded in Murrysville, Pa., in 1950. The Theatre's productions were staged in a 100-year-old barn on the property of its founders, Joseph and Alphretta DeSimone. Throughout its years, Sherwood performed small, but quality community theatre. Each season consisted of six to nine productions which were performed over the summer months and ranged from light-hearted comedies and musicals to serious drama and politically themed plays. Sherwood became a non-profit incorporation in 1958. In 1973, the daughter of the De Simones, Joy Tobin, became the producing director. She began the process of applying for and receiving state and federal funding for the theatre, which paid for staffing and production costs.|||In 1980, the Theatre's Board of Trustees created Sherwood's mission statement: ""The Sherwood Forest Theatre is a not-for-profit, incorporated community theatre committed to providing, through professional leadership: 1. Quality theatre for its audiences. 2. The opportunity for participation by all members of our community without regard to age, sex, race, or religion. 3. Additional educational experiences in theatre arts for all ages. 4. The enhancement of the cultural growth of the area population."" In the late 1980s, federal funding became more scarce as the United States slipped into a recession. The Sherwood Forest Theatre ceased operations at the end of its 1994 season due to financial difficulties.","The Sherwood Forest Theatre operated in the New Kensington/Murrysville (Pa.) community from 1950 to 1994.

Included in the collection is information on the artists that performed for and were sponsored by the foundation; files on the development, marketing, and finances of the foundation; board of trustees meeting minutes; and a large amount of materials on the Foundation's education program in New York City and also its national residency program. The Foundation's two main productions, The Song Continues annual concert and the On Wings of Song recital program, are both covered in great detail.","The Marilyn Horne Foundation (MHF) was formed in 1993 to promote the art of the vocal recital. Marilyn Horne is widely recognized as one of the greatest opera performers in history. Ms. Horne started her foundation because she grew worried that the tradition of the song recital was disappearing. The eminent opera star wanted to support young recitalists and give them the opportunity to refine their craft. She acknowledged that there still seemed to be eager audiences for song recitals in cities like New York, but at the time, Ms. Horne noted that institutions and organizations around the country that used to present song recital series regularly started dropping out of the business.|||The Marilyn Horne Foundation was one of the most influential and esteemed national nonprofits devoted exclusively to song and to gifted young vocal recitalists. The Foundation was officially launched on January 16, 1994, with a gala concert at Carnegie Hall celebrating Ms. Horne's 60th birthday. The mission statement of the Foundation was ""to encourage, support and preserve the art of the vocal recital through the presentation of recitals and related educational activities in communities across the United States.""|||The Marilyn Horne Foundation achieved this mission through the presentation of recitals, residencies, concerts, radio broadcasts, educational outreach and song commissions. In addition to performances at Carnegie Hall and the Julliard School of Music, the Foundation performed hundreds of recitals at schools, colleges, and universities across the country. The Foundation sponsored “The Song Continues,” which was a weeklong festival of master classes and recitals culminating with an annual concert.|||The Foundation selected a number of aspiring young singers to send on the road for four-day residencies in partnership with community-based concert presenters, music festivals or colleges. The singers offered recitals and visited local schools. The first two singers sponsored by the Foundation were soprano Bridgett Hooks and tenor Olafur Bjarnason. There was also a competition, held in July for students enrolled at the Music Academy for the West in Santa Barbara, California, where Marilyn Horne served as a voice program director from 1977. Two winners (a singer and pianist) were presented each season at the “Wings of Song” recital in New York.|||The Foundation also supported the “On Wings of Song” program which started in 1995 as a vocal recital series and later included radio broadcasts on WQXR. Marilyn Horne and WQXR’s Elliot Forrest co-hosted an hour that consisted of part concert, part master-class, and part reminiscence. The concerts were recorded live at Christ & Stephen’s Church in New York City. The program was eventually folded into “The Song Continues” series.|||Over the course of the fifteen year plus history of the Foundation, over 100 artists were sponsored. In July 2010, the Foundation closed and the programs of the Marilyn Horne Foundation were incorporated into the Weill Music Institute at Carnegie Hall with Marilyn Horne serving as the Artistic Advisor. Both The Song Continues, the annual festival, and the On Wings of Song vocal recital series live on to introduce and support emerging young vocalists.","The Marilyn Horne Foundation was formed in 1993 to promote the art of the vocal recital.

He received his foundational dance training at the New York Metropolitan High School of the Performing Arts (now LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts). Johnson began his professional career in 1960 as a member of the Eleo Pomare and Raymond Sawyer Dance Company. During this time, he continued his formal study of dance at a number of New York-based studios. On scholarships, Johnson studied dance composition, Hattian and Afro-Caribbean under Jean-Léon Destiné at the New Dance Group Studio, the Lector Horton Technique at the Clark Center of the Performing Arts, and the Katherine Dunham Technique under Ms. Dunham herself.|||In 1965, Johnson traveled to Paris as part of Katherine Dunham’s last professional company and took part in the French movie musical Deux Anges Sont Venus and the film adaptation of Léopold Sédar Senghor’s Chaka. Upon returning to the United States in 1966, Mr. Johnson took dance instructor positions in Washington, D.C. and New York City. In this same year he made his acting debut as the lead in Kelly Marie Berry’s dance drama, Black Happenin’. In 1967, Bob Johnson appeared in the N.Y. Shakespeare Festival original production of Hair. This was quickly followed by a dramatic role in Ed Bullins’ Off-Broadway production, Goin’ a Buffallo. Between 1968 and 1969 he returned to his dance background with stints with the Harlem Cultural Council’s Dancemobile.|||In 1969, Bob Johnson relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to serve as a dance consultant for Project Self Esteem, a collaboration between local universities and youth groups. Members of the University of Pittsburgh’s Black Studies Department took notice of Johnson in this role and offered him a position teaching both dance and drama in the department starting in the 1970-1971 school year. He accepted the post and remained in the department until his death in 1986. His courses included Afro American Dance I and II and Kuumba Theatre Workshop, later renamed Creativity Workshop. It was also in Pittsburgh where he met and married his wife, the former Stephanie Cooper.|||In 1970, Bob Johnson founded the Pittsburgh Black Theatre Dance Ensemble which aimed to shed light on the breadth of culture in the African Diaspora to bring attention to issues facing the community through dance. Johnson served as artistic director of the company for a number of years during which time he choreographed signature works such as Free Spirit Song, Ritual of Damballah, Ego Trippin’ and American Fruit with African Roots. Outside of the university and the dance company he founded, Mr. Johnson continued to work professionally as a dancer, choreographer, actor and director. During the summer months, Johnson toured nationally and internationally as a Dancer with Sun Ra and His Arkestra, performing in such places as Nigeria, Italy, France, and the Netherlands. As a choreographer, he crafted dance numbers for local productions such as the musical Liberty Avenue, and Off-Broadway Plays including Who Loves the Dancer by Rob Penny and How do you Spell Watergait by James Durrah. He continued to pursue local stage work and made his film debut in the John Russo horror film Midnight. Johnson would also go on to direct theater, notably the first staged production of August Wilson’s Jitney in 1982.|||Bob Johnson passed away due to heart failure on July 6, 1986.|||Stephanie Cooper Johnson was born November 10, 1948 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, to Samuel and Ernestine Davis Cooper.

She served as a committee member of Pittsburgh Ward 4, an officer with the University of Pittsburgh African American Alumni Council, member of the Alumnae Association, and Afro-American History Society.

Curtis Theatre Collection is its Pittsburgh theatre programs. Dr. Ford E. Curtis began teaching drama in the English department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1924. He and his wife, Harriet, were avid theatre goers, attending performances every week. After his retirement in 1961, he began to add to their personal collection of playbills and programs in the hopes of building a collection to donate to Pitt.|||In the early 1960s, Dr. Curtis even went so far as to put advertisements in Carnegie Magazine, the Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine, and programs for the Pittsburgh Playhouse. The advertisements put out a call for any and all Pittsburgh programs to be donated to him; he even listed his home address and telephone number, with the goal to build a Pittsburgh theatre history collection for the University of Pittsburgh. Large numbers of programs were also donated by the New York Public Library and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.|||The materials that Dr. Curtis amassed -- his own collection, materials donated to him, and the Curtis Collection staff's current efforts to acquire additional programs -- help to document the history of theatre and the performing arts in Pittsburgh.","The Ford E. and Harriet R.
