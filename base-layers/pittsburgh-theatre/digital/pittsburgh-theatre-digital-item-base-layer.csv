These venues are arranged alphabetically by name, then chronologically. In some instances, a performing arts group did not have a home theatre or consistent venue where they performed, such as the Civic Light Opera and the Quantum Theatre. In these instances, the programs and other materials are filed under the title of the performing arts group. With each series, the total number of document boxes is listed. The boxes are not numbered consecutively as found in other archival collections because these numbers regularly change with new donations. Typically, the collection's policy is to only keep two copies of a program, although exceptions to this include commemorative programs and programs that are autographed or contain marginalia. Where individual programs are listed for online access, the date listed is usually the start date for the production's engagement. Typically, productions would start on a Monday and the same program would be issued throughout the run of performances.
