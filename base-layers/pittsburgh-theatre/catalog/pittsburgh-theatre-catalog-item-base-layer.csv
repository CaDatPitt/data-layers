""Here is Hirschfeld on the dramatic and droll stories behind his scenes, as well as those of the Broadway stages he's covered graphically since the American theatre came of age with O'Neill and Show Boat. Here are his most famous and enduring imageslike that one of Liza Minnelli in Cabaret, or that long-striding one of Robert Preston in The Music Man, or that one of, well, the list - the distinguished line - goes on and on. He tells us at long last not only why he draws but what and how he has drawn it."" ""For those who've missed the past seventy-five years of opening nights on Broadway and would like to catch up, this is the book for them. For those who would like a pictorial summation of our time - from the early, ""hopeful"" years of Soviet Russia to the final, cynical episode of Seinfeld, this book is for them. And for those who would just like to know how and why Al Hirschfeld started putting all those NINAs into each and every one of his drawings - and why no power on earth can now grant him leave to cease and desist - this book is essential.""--BOOK JACKET.","American wit and humor, Pictorial|||Cartoonists|||Hirschfeld, Al",,United States|||n-us---,,1557833567 :,98088469,40511790,

Chapters each define a key trash topic (Sex Trash, Action Trash, Horror Trash, Race Trash, Groovy Trash, and Docu Trash), collecting the funniest, most disturbing and desperate posters from each genre; and short introductions set the tone, offer eye-opening context, and then just get out of the way to let the posters themselves run riot on the page. Thrill to unfortunate star turns, towering tidal waves, armies of killer spiders, sex-starved zombies, and explosion after glorious explosion.

Just as the forties was the decade hailed nostalgically ever since as Hollywood's golden age, it also saw the emergence of a dark new undercurrent in pop culture - the sinister world of gumshoes, gangsters, double-crossing dames, and blind alleys that comprised film noir."" ""Long before the era of the television trailer and satellite media junket, studios lured audiences to theaters with graphically bold poster art, gorgeously illustrated by classically trained artists adept at capturing the nuances of Veronica Lake's seductive glance, Humphrey Bogart's world-weary eyes, Bette Davis's icy stare, and hundreds of other stars at their best and most glamorous. All of the era's legendary stars are included in this volume: Lauren Bacall, Robert Mitchum, Barbara Stanwyck, Rita Haworth, Cary Grant, Henry Fonda, Marlene Dietrich, and more.

Arranged in roughly chronological order, it brings together movie posters from around the world, starting with Charlie Chaplin film ads and the Russian Revolutionary movie posters of the 1910s, then spanning the century to show posters publicizing hits of the 1990s, including The Silence of the Lambs, Spike Lee films, and many more. The books sections focus on renowned individual designers, directors, movies, and genres. Important poster designers such as Saul Bass, Jan Lenica, and Juan Gatti receive particular attention, as do great directors who had strong opinions about how their films should be represented. Among the latter are Alfred Hitchcock, Jean-Luc Godard, and Otto Preminger. All major film genres are represented musicals, Kung Fu movies, films noir, westerns (including so-called spaghetti westerns filmed in Italy), science fiction classics, and others. Readers are treated to examples of movie posters not only from the United States, Britain, and France, but also to previously unpublished examples from countries as diverse as Poland, China, and Cuba. For instance, fans of Orson Welles might be surprised to see the previously unpublished Italian poster advertising Citizen Kane under its Italian title, Quarto Potere (The Fourth Estate). This handsome volume will be valued by graphic designers, poster collectors, and anyone sharing the popular passion for cinema.",Film posters,,,,0764155997 :,2003102236,ocm53177743,

Bound ledger books (scrapbooks 22-34) and composition books (scrapbooks 35-39) were used for clippings of interest from magazines and newspapers. The final volume is a loose-leaf notebook presented by Eva Wasbutsky, Mr. Barth's secretary, after his death. Mr. Barth had an interest in all the performing arts. However, his focus was on theater and film, in particular Shakespeare. The final volumes are chiefly on Shakespearean productions, on stage, film, radio, and T.V. Loose souvenir programs and pamphlets were removed and integrated into the Curtis Theatre files and loose clippings not pertinent to the performing arts were discarded as were duplicate periodicals already held by the University Library System.","Stage history|||Theater|||Performing arts|||Shakespeare, William 1564-1616",,Ohio|||East Liverpool|||Pennsylvania|||Pittsburgh|||n-us-oh|||n-us-pa,,,,31151607,
