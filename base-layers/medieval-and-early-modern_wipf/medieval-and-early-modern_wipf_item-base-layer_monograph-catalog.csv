Unlike other of his works, these treatises are notably moderate in tone, taking into account different views on structure and causation in a relatively even-handed way.

He looks at the structure of the tongue and the oesophagus, and asks why mental perceptions can have physical effects on the body. Some of his questions still trouble modern scientists, although they would not accept most of his answers. The extensive Introduction and Commentary explain the medical background for non-medical specialists, and discuss the place of this treatise and of anatomy in medieval medicine down to Leonardo da Vinci. As well as being the first English translation of this important work, this is also the first comparative study of medieval translations of the same ancient text, and is based on new editions and collations of all three.

This is the first published version of these works in a modern language. After a brief summary of Galen's medical system, the author goes on to consider the origins of Galen's ideas and methods, with particular reference to the Hippocratic writings, and the question why Galen, in common with most of the ancient physicians, believed in the efficacy of the comedy. The effects of bloodletting are considered in terms of modem physiology and medicine, and the possibility is explored that it may indeed have been beneficial in the conditions prevailing in Galen's time.","Phlebotomy|||Medicine, Greek and Roman|||Bloodletting|||history|||Medicine, Traditional|||Galen|||Γαληνός 129-199 &#x03B.C@.Χ",,Italy|||Greece,,0521320852|||9780521320856,85025489,ocm12724204,

He misses the clarity and simplicity of the Hippocratic writer, his straightforward way of putting things, and finds Galen verbose, quibbling, hairsplitting at times. However, he should not let himself be discouraged, should keep reading and he will soon discover that Galen was a very great physician who has a great deal to say. Times had changed since the days of Hippocrates; almost six centuries had elapsed, generations of sophists had systematized knowledge and taught the art of disputation, and gone were the days of the democratic city states of ancient Greece. Galen wrote most of his books in imperial Rome, in the whirl of a metropolis that was the capital of the entire Western world. Galen's Hygiene is a real mine of information. It shows how highly developed and sophisticated personal hygiene had become since the days of Hippocrates and Diocles. It was not a hygiene for the masses, for the common people but was addressed to a small upper class, was written ""for Greeks and for those who, though born barbarians by nature, yet emulate the culture of the Greeks."" The Romans of noble birth in the second century A.D. were no longer the Romans of early republican days who were not afraid to handle the plough and take the sword in hand. They were landowners, politicians, administrators who lived in close connection with the imperial court. They were deeply imbued with Greek culture and had the leisure to devote much attention to their physical wellbeing. They had the time and the means to follow the precepts of Galen's hygiene""--Introduction.

This book seeks to elucidate the pathological and anatomical terminology of Latin veterinary treatises, and the general linguistic features of Pelagonius as a technical writer. Veterinary practice in antiquity cannot be related directly to that of the modern world. In antiquity a man could claim expertise in horse medicine without ever passing an examination. Owners often treated their own animals. The distinction between 'professional' and layman was thus blurred, and equally the distinction between 'scientific' terminology and layman's terminology was not as clear-cut as it is today. The first part of the book is devoted to some of the non-linguistic factors which influenced the terminology in which horse diseases and their treatment were described.","Language|||Langue|||Grammaire|||Grammar|||Veterinary medicine|||Latin language, Vulgar|||Lexicology|||Latin language|||Medical Latin|||Pelagonius|||Pelagonius (03.-03)|||Pelagonius (03.-03.)|||Ars veterinaria|||Ars veterinaria (Pelagonius)",,,,9004102817|||9789004102811,95003754,ocm32167620,

The manuscripts were buried in 168 B.C. along with their owner, a man who belonged to the local elite. The medical manuscripts reveal for the first time the breadth of medical knowledge in third and early-second century B.C. China. There is also unprecedented documentation of magic in the medical manuscripts, of the use of incantations, rituals, and charms to treat ailments and to serve other human needs."" ""Donald Harper's translation of the Mawangdui medical manuscripts is the first complete translation in any language. Based on the photographic reproduction of the manuscripts and transcription published in Chinese in Beijing in 1985, the translation is thoroughly annotated and incorporates corrections of transcription errors in the Beijing edition. In addition, Harper provides new transcriptions of three texts based on textual evidence that became available after publication of the Beijing edition. Thus, this book provides the most accurate representation of these remarkable manuscripts.""--BOOK JACKET.","Medicine, Chinese|||Manuscripts, Chinese",,China|||Mawangdui Site (China),,0710305826,96047823,,

In 1751, the Spanish Crown asserted control over the production and distribution of this medicament by establishing a royal reserve of ""fever trees"" in Quito. Through this pilot project, the Crown pursued a new vision of imperialism informed by science and invigorated through commerce. But ultimately this project failed, much like the broader imperial reforms that it represented. Drawing on extensive archival research, Matthew Crawford explains why, showing how indigenous healers, laborers, merchants, colonial officials, and creole elites contested European science and thwarted imperial reform by asserting their authority to speak for the natural world.

Galen synthesized the entirety of Greek medicine as a basis for his own doctrines and practice, which comprehensively embraced theory, practical knowledge, experiment, logic, and a deep understanding of human life and society. His treatise Hygiene, also known as ""On the Preservation of Health"" (De sanitate tuenda), was written during one of Galen's most prolific periods (170-180) and ranks among his most important and influential works, providing a comprehensive account of the practice of preventive medicine that still has relevance today. Also included in this two-volume edition are two shorter treatises on the relationship between health and wellness. Thrasybulus explores the theoretical question of whether hygiene is part of medicine or gymnastics, and in so doing delineates the interrelated roles of doctors and physical therapists.

This was not so in the eighteenth century when doctors, scientists, writers and artists formed a well-integrated educated elite and often collaborated with each other. Physicians like Erasmus Darwin doubled as poets; novelists such as Tobias Smollett were medically qualified. This close interplay of medicine and literature in the Enlightenment showed in literary ideas and expression - debates raged as to whether writing was itself therapeutic, or possibly a disease. And poets and novelists for their part drew heavily on medical language and learning for their models of human nature, of the action of the emotions and the dialectic of body and psyche."" ""Written by leading historians of medicine and eighteenth-century literary critics, Literature and Medicine During the Eighteenth Century takes up these themes, paying special attention to questions of body language and the representation of the inner life. The chapters include an analysis of dreams and the unconscious; a discussion of the medical theories concerning the prolongation of life, and the way in which novelists picked up on this theme; and the cults of invalidism and hypochondria."" ""In addition, broader-ranging social historical discussions investigate the relations between the medical colleges and Grub Street, between the emergent professional doctor and the new breed of writers, and the way medicine contributed towards informing a gendered view of the world. A major new exploration of the unity of Enlightenment culture, Literature and Medicine During the Eighteenth Century will be of interest to intellectual historians, literary scholars and medical historians alike.""--BOOK JACKET.",English literature|||History and criticism|||Literature and medicine|||History|||Medicine|||Early works to 1800|||Medicine in literature,18th century,Great Britain,,0415070821,92023538,26400037,

After an exposition of the best regimen for the traveller, Qusta mentions the different diseases which may befall him, namely, fatigue, earache, diseases of the bronchial tubes and those caused by dust. Recommended remedies are simple and compound drugs, bathing and massage. Qusta then discusses criteria to determine the quality of water, means to improve bad water, and means to quench one's thirst. In the next chapter Qusta treats the prophylaxis against vermin and the treatment of stings and bites caused by them. After a lucid exposition of spontaneous generation, Qusta concludes his treatise by discussing the occurrence of the Dracunculus medinesis and its treatment. -- Jacket.","Medicine, Arab|||Travel|||Health aspects|||Handbooks, manuals, etc|||Muslim pilgrims and pilgrimages|||History, Medieval|||Medicine, Arabic|||History of Medicine|||Qusṭā ibn Lūqā approximately 820-approximately 912",Early works to 1800,Mecca|||Saudi Arabia,,9004095411|||9789004095410,91029098,ocm24377331,

Scholarly debate has long focused on the traditional attribution of the work to the mysterious Trotula, said to have been the first female professor of medicine in eleventh- or twelfth-century Salerno, just south of Naples, then the leading center of medical learning in Europe. Yet as Monica H. Green reveals in her introduction to this first edition of the Latin text since the sixteenth century, and the first English translation of the book ever based upon a medieval form of the text, the Trotula is not a single treatise but an ensemble of three independent works, each by a different author.|||To varying degrees, these three works reflect the synthesis of indigenous practices of southern Italians with the new theories, practices, and medicinal substances coming out of the Arabic world.""--Jacket.","Gynecology|||Obstetrics|||Medicine|||History|||Women|||Health and hygiene|||Medicine, Medieval|||History, Medieval|||Women's Health|||(médecin Trotula Di Ruggiero 1050?-1097?)|||Trotula",,Salerno|||Italy|||Italien,,0812235894|||9780812235890|||0812237894|||9780812217704,00047945,ocm45102919,

The edition and translation are framed by a bio-bibliographical sketch of the author, a source-critical study of the text, a detailed description of the extant manuscripts, and various indices which make the material accessible from different angles. Jacob's treatise is significant in several ways: first, as an example for the lasting influence of the Greek medico-philosophical tradition, especially Galenism, on medieval Arabic and Jewish scholarship; second, as an authentic witness to the theoretical and practical state of Arabic medicine in the high Middle Ages; third, it illustrates the Jewish contribution to medieval Islamic science; and fourth, it contains valuable information relating to socio-cultural history in general.

The Knowing of Woman's Kind in Childing is a short fifteenth-century prose treatise which claims to be translated from Latin texts (or Latin and French) that derive ultimately from the Greek. It has a unique importance as it was written apparently by a woman, for a female audience, and on the subject of women. The text considers women's physical constitution, what makes them different from men (primarily the possession of a womb) and, in particular, the three types of problem that the womb causes. That it was written for a female audience is made explicit in the Prologue where the writer explains that he has translated this text because literate women are more likely to read English than any other language and can then pass on the information it contains to illiterate women. The text is a translation, no doubt by a man rather than a woman, but one of his ultimate sources was a text attributed to 'Trotula', in the Middle Ages believed to be the name of a midwife or gynaecologist from Salerno, who wrote extensively on women's ailments, childbirth and beauty care. Recent work shows that such a woman, probably named Trota, did exist and that she did write a gynaecological treatise, the Trotula or 'little Trota', which became closely associated with two other texts not by her. All three however became very popular and were widely disseminated under her name.""--Jacket.","Gynecology|||Obstetrics|||Women|||Health and hygiene|||Medicine, Medieval|||Labor, Obstetric|||History of Medicine|||History, Medieval|||Menstruation Disturbances|||Pregnancy Complications|||Prenatal Care|||Trotula",,,,2503510736|||9782503510736,2003418427,ocm48417837,

""Unschuld traces the history of the Su wen to its origins in the final centuries B.C.E., when numerous authors wrote short medical essays to explain the foundations of human health and illness on the basis of the newly developed vessel theory. He examines the meaning of the title and the way the work has been received throughout Chinese medical history, both before and after the eleventh century when the text as it is known today emerged. Unschuld's survey of the contents includes illuminating discussions of the yin-yang and five-agents doctrines, the perception of the human body and its organs, qi and blood, pathogenic agents, concepts of disease and diagnosis, and a variety of therapies, including the new technique of acupuncture.
