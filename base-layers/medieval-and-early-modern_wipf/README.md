**Abstract**: The present collection is comprised of 1,096 items, dating from the medieval period to the year 1800, held by the University of Pittsburgh Library System (ULS). The mediums of the collection include physical books, pamphlets, and broadsides; facsimile editions; CD-Roms; online material that requires a subscription to access; and microfilm. The collection is held across various libraries in the ULS. The collection was compiled using the ULS catalogue system, Alma, and narrowed using keyword searches and manual sorting. A portion of the collection had been previously compiled by the Frick Fine Arts library staff and undergraduate student workers, and this compilation was incorporated into the data. Data was found using keyword searches such as "Illumination of books and manuscripts," "early works to 1800," "maps," and "music."

**Scope and Content**: This collection is aimed at the researcher who wants to engage with original or facsimile sources for their work. Researchers who work in the areas of the late antique, medieval, and early modern eras will find this collection especially useful. The items in this collection skew heavily European, with English, French, and German works well represented. However, Middle Eastern, East Asian, and North American works are also represented. The collection also includes a range of genres: religious texts such as Bibles, psalters, books of hours, and liturgical works; popular works such as poetry, history, and allegory; music; and maps. Additionally, the large collection of early printed pamphlets and incunabula held by the Health Science Library System represents over half of the collection.
