The first presents a collection of Left wing agitation and propaganda publications that demonstrate representative rhetoric on positions important to the American Left during the Depression decade through World War II. Primarily in the form of broadsides, pamphlets, newsletters, and flyers, these documents detail both issues known internationally and ones unique to Pittsburgh. For a sampling of material contained within this series, please consult the online exhibit at http://images.library.pitt.edu/a/aeforbes. Series II consists of material personal to Forbes, such as his writing and correspondence. The correspondence that Forbes maintained with his family and friends in the midst of his travels prior to World War II comprise the majority of this series. The collection contains letters as early as 1922, but not until the late 1920s is the correspondence continuous. Additionally, this series contains his efforts at writing fiction (drafts of short stories, ideas for novels, and scripts for plays) and a 1939 diary detailing his thoughts on life, women and politics. While the focus of Series II is not communism or the Communist Party, documents and references to both are found throughout the series.","Communists|||Authors, American|||Forbes, A.
