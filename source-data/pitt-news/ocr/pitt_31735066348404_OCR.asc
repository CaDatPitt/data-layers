Platt Takes so Prsidency in Landslide  

  6 Board Seats Filled

- with Low Voter Turnout 

BY BILL MOORE

Larry Platt won a landslide victory ‘

‘in the Student Government presi-
dential election last night taking
744.4% of the student vote.

V Platt garnered an unnofficial 815
votes to defeat his nearest
opponent Bruce Keeler by almost
400 votes. Paul Hertneky and
Steffi Brooks followed in third and
fourth place, respectively.

Leading the Board election were
Mary Schwarz with an unnofﬁcial
757 votes, followed by Stephen
Tarnock, Tyrone Hubbard, Craig
Bluestein, Dan Stifﬂer, and Mark
Satinoff. '

Only 1,832 of the approximately
13,000 full-time undergraduates
eligible turned out to vote in the
two-day election. .

. The new SG president will assum

his one-year term of office
 following an inaugural dinner in

"early February. _

‘ Platt was obviously ‘pleased with
 victory Thursday night but
expressed disappointment at the
“low voter tumout.”

“I hope we can‘ change that for /

next year,” he said. ' I

During his campaign Platt pro-
posed 4 more involvement by, his
administration in consumer prob-
lems facing students. He said he
would work on such problems as
landlord-tenant disputes, and ad-
ministrative red,-tape in obtaining

' invoices.

He also pledges to concentrate on
increasing student‘ ﬁnancial aid,
and attempting to obtain special
student rates at Oakland busi-
nesses..

This year's election was marred
by a number of appeals by

candidates concerning rulings I

made by the SG Election Com-
mittee, although at this time the
election is expected to stand
uncontested. I
The strongest showing by voters
was in the Towers lobby where 677

"votes were cast, followed .by the

Student Union, and the Cathedral.

Platt’s nearest contender, Keeler,
took an unnofficial 418 votes for
22.8% of the total, Hertneky pulled
309 votes, and Steffi Brooks
received 229.

In the Board election, Schwarz
won with. an unnofﬁcial 757 votes

for 41.3%; Tarnock followed with;

663' votes; Hubbard with 620;

Bluestein, 604; Stiffler, S15; and

Satinoff, 477. _ 1,

Wayne. Leiss left his Shadyside -

apartment about 6:30 last night,
hopped on his motorcycle, endured
a bitterly cold ride through city
streets, and went to Pitt’s Student
Union to .cast‘ his vote in the
Student Government elections.

As "a person who could be
considered freaky in appearance by
some standards, Leiss might have
been asked if he hadn’t really just
walked in off the street ten minutes
before the polls were to close,
noticed one of the posters urging
students to do their patriotic duty,
and then voted--for kicks.

“No, I'm really serious about
voting, but;I didn't make? it to
school this afternoon to vote, and
supper held me back a little
tonight,” he said, explaining his
near-tardiness, right after pulling
the levers on machines borrowed

“Student Government is some-
thing everyone should have an
opinion about,” he edded. “I
voted against candidates who were
opposed to credit for ROTC, but I
liked the girl who wanted to turn
the bookstore into a co-op.” _

Describing himself as “somewhat
on the radical side,” Leiss, an
engineering student, said he tries
to vote in all elections. “I even
voted for Nixon in 1972, but only
after being influenced by my father
at the last minute. I swallowed his
propaganda.”

But Leiss’ actions--leaving his
warm apartment simply to go vote
in the SG elections--seems to be an‘
oddity, because he was one of only
1832 students--many of which live
much closer than Shadyside to
bother. P .

remunerated and how much this
remuneration should be.

Two earlier motions concerning
remuneration failed, one because
of its vague wording which could
-causeit to possibly be misinter-
preted. The other failed because it
required board members to put in
an eight hour day, leaving them no
time to take summer courses.

This proposal also failed because
it would immediately budget
10,000 to remuneration.

Both motions did not take into
consideration that a board member
could be a commuter and require
less remuneration than a person
living away from home the entire
summer. The proposal passed
would leave the summer of 1976 as

the earliest date for remuneration. L

In other action the Board voted to
endorse: the National Student
Conference Against Racism and
send a representative to planning
meetings and the conference.

The allocations . by-laws were
modiﬁed to improve and streamline
procedures to make the process
more efficient.

“Length of term in a bureaucratic

Porter’s appointment will give the
Black Studies department its ﬂrst
permanent head in over a year and
a half since Jack Daniel resigned
the chair in July 1973. The result
was the appointment of a series of
interim heads and the creation of a
situation often referred to as “the
Black Studies Crisis.”l '

Rosenberg named Roland Smith
permanent head in October 1974,
but a protest by 100 faculty
members, community leaders, and

ported students who favored Porter
for the position ensued, and Smith

Keeler packed away his borrowed

offered Platt a gentlemanly hand-
shake. “Good Luck! You are
gonna really need it,” Keeler told
the man who had just acquired a
year of crisis and criticism.

Platt could only tell the Pitt News
he was “happy” at first. Later he
expressed his let-down with the
poor showing by voters. “I think
that is an indication of how
students are disgusted with stu-
dent government and I hope we can
change that for next year,” he said.

Shortly after 8:10pm it was over.

The Pocketbook Revolution

‘ I
BY TOM SMITH’

How many times within the last
few weeks have we heard some
economist or government spokes-
man say that the American people
are willing to make sacriﬁces to
solve our economic problems and

* curb the energy shortage?

In his State of the Union address
President Gerald Ford even re-
ferred to the need for all of us to
tighten our belts. But, he and
everyone else has not yet realized

that it’s pretty silly to tighten belts ,

when you have lost your pants.

The current administration is in
for the shock of its very young life.
The American people are not
willing to make the sacriﬁces Ford
suggests. The proposed tax on oil
imports is an example.

This tax will be passed onto the
consumer, and even the govern-
ment, which in the past has had a
fairly fuzzy crystal ball, expects
gasoline to increase .20 per gallon.

consumption of gas so rationing
will not be necessary. E

And how does the government
seek to get public support for its
plan? Simple. It holds out the
possibility ofa tax cut.
' And guess who is to suffer the
most from ‘ the plan? Why,
naturally, we patriotic Americans
who according to the government
are prepared to make sacriﬁces.
And that translates to the average
American middle and lower .class

The President's plan is sure to
hurt that groupof Americans least
able to make sacriﬁces. The tax cut
proposed by the government will
apply to all economic classes
similarly, so the more money
earned the more money returned
via a tax cut. V

And, certainly, anyone who is able
to afforda .20 a gallon increase at
the gas pumps is not going to worry
too much about their" gas hog’s
consumption. -

Though all of us for the most part‘

_ will admit some though not much of

our driving is luxury oriented, it is
an absolutely essential part of
modern life for the majority ‘of
middle and lower class citizens.
This is especially valid in
communities where ofﬁcials. are

more concerned with petty political _
squabbles than in filling a mass ‘

transit vaccuum. Coupled with that
is the federal government’s ‘failure
to provide assistance beyond
supplementary funding of local

‘ development.

And as the oil tax is passed onto
the consumer, do we have any
reason to expect that the major oil
companies will not once again this
year as they have been doing
throughout their existence reap
such absurd proﬁts.

Perhaps, it’s time for the
government to ask corporations to
also make sacrifices. What are the
oil companies prepared to sacri-
ﬁce? However, the government
doesn’t ask the companies, whose
laborers are some of the lowest
paid plant workers in the nation, to
sacriﬁce anything. -

And what about the auto
industry? Not too long ago the auto
companies increased prices for new
models, which was met with strong
consumer resistance. Layoffs fol-.
lowed and now consumers are
being offered cash rebates to buy

' new cars.

The government , asks ‘the -A auto

' industry to design ‘autos capable of‘

delivering more mileage per gallon
of gas. Obviously, this in the best
interests of the auto industry.
Unless such an auto is developed
more Americans will be buying
cars, only when absolutely neces-
sary, and the consumer will be
more economically minded select-

ing the smaller car to the more

expensive luxury car.
Butlto get the, auto companies to
pursue a policy, which is in their

own best interests, the government

has to make .a deal with the
companies to relax emissions
standards. And who is going‘ to
suffer the most from the polluted
air. The auto company magnate

, could care less.

For years Americans have heard
from politicians that major tax
reform is needed, which is obvious
when men like Lawrence Rockefel-
ler and Ronald. Reagan legally are

not required to pay any national
taxes.

And not only are there no
immediate tax reform plans, but
government spokesmen openly
claim it would not be wise to attach
tax reform proposals to the

.administration’s economic and

energy proposals.
How long can the government
expect Americans to sacriﬁce when’

such inequities permeate the

system. The point is that it is time
others also be required to make
sacriﬁces, including corporations,
the wealthy class, and also

‘ government oﬂicials.

if the average American has to
bite the bullet, our overpaid go-'
vernment bureaucrats also should
suffer. And judging how inade-
quately they have managed the
affairs of the nation, there is not
one government employee who has
sufficient basis to protest a wage-
cut. ' — ‘
Americans are beyond losing their

shirts. And they are tired of being’

asked for more. Afterall, inﬂation
already has crippled the poor and
middle classes, who now are only
begging for equity. Few will
scream if all Americans are sharing
the burden equally.

Usually, revolutions are not the
children of ideological confronta-
tions, but, instead, they have their
origins in the pocketbook. The day

is very near when the poor and‘ '

middle classes in this country. will
be vocally and actively disgusted
with their leadership and the
system which supplies that leader-
ship. '

And if the Ford administration
continues its wayward path, the _

man who assumed ofﬁce hoping to
be recognized as the great
reconciliator will only hasten the
day of division, internal strife, and
revolt. »

Judicial System

Dear Editor, .

in response to ‘the Pittsburgh
Press story Sunday, January 19,
1975 on» “Police at Pitt May Face
Jurisdiction Legal Test," 1 would

like to note the following com-

ments.

Authority and jurisdictional boun-
daries have been tested time and-
again in cases 7 concerning Pitt
police officers in the judicial sys-
tem.

The decisions of those tests or

‘ challenges have always been ruled

in . favor of the Pitt Police in
reference to their authority and

jurisdiction. , .
in answering the question of did
Pitt‘ policement overstep their

bounds in this particular case, the
answer is unquestionably No.

If Magistrate Troiano and city
police legal advisor Arthur Gilkes
would take note of the location of
the arrest they could clearly see
that it is within the boundaries of in
and’ upon, and in the immediate
and adjacent vicinity of the Pitt’
Campus area and property. '

As to the question of Pitt police.

beingguilty of similar indiscretions
in the past, I resent the implication
of Pitt policemen even being consi-
dered guilty before Magistrate
Troiano and legal advisor Arthur
Gilkes are able to provide conclu-
sive-— proof that we have, and their
admission of only feeling that we

A have.

Troiano and Gilkes are of the
opinion that the Pitt police should

have summoned city officers rather
than act alone on this particular
arrest but that may imply that the
Pitt Police Department is a sub-
standard Police Department which
is far from being true.

The‘Pitt Police Department is a
highly professional and competent
department, and l could supply
endless proof that will attest to
that. ‘

Besides that, it is not customary
for one police department to ask
another police to do what they can
do themselves, and as any police-
man can tell you, there are many

«instances where circumstances

dictafe how you handle that parti-

-cular ‘situation.

Magistrate Troiano said he held
four of the suspects for the grand

, juryibecause there was no case law

to guide him in his ruling.

Well, as any" Magistrate should
know, according, to the Pennsyl-
vania criminal law and procedures

book, a magistrate is to rul_e,_o_n_ the
evidence presented [and not some

case law guideline.
Magistrate Troiano’s statements

.-and remarks bring to mind a

question of his competence and

fitness to sit on the magistrate’s.

 

bench, and why, after all the time
he's served on the bend does he
now wander if he‘ knows what he's

, doing.

As to Troiano’s and Gilke‘s opin-
ion to the press for the public to
read that the case against the four
would be thrown out in Criminal

Court, tells me that these two canTt '

follow guidelines when there are
guidelines to follow, especially
when even a rookie policeman
knows _ that Pre-trial prejudicial
opinions made public are not done.

Mr. Gilkes states that Pitt police-
men have clearly acted out of their
bailiwick, even out of the city. I

1 am disturbed that a police
advisor would tell a story without
telling the whole story‘.

in all of the traffic pinches “that I
am aware of, the cases involved
included hit_and run, leaving the
scene of _ an accident, assaulting
police officers with a motor vehicle
(Pitt policemen), recklessly endan-
gering the lives-of-police officers
(Pitt police officers), and innumer-
able others.

Now, I understand that sometimes
these charges are reduced at the
magistrate’s courts to minor traffic
violations, but I wonder if Magis-

    
      
      
  
   
   
   
    
  
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
  
 
  
    
  

 

   I...-.,..  I. the M...  

trate Troiano  Pittsburgh Police
advisor Arthur Gilkes would like ‘to

expain to the public how that’

happens and why it happens, and I
am sure they won’t all comeout in
the good name of justice.

I consider Magistrate Troiano and
the» City Police Advisor’s state-
ments and remarks non-profes-
sional and cheap. .:

Pitt maintains a fine Police De-
partment to serve the University
and campus community, which is
also the city of Pittsburgh, at great
expense. A

it's a shame Pitt doesn’t get credit
for all the good services it provides
for all to share. ' ’

I wonder if the city of Pittsburgh
would care to fund the expense of
providing these services.

THE CONTROVERSY

Academic credit for military

science courses was an accepted

part of the University until 1968

when the Faculty Senate's Com-

mittee on Student Affairs recom-

mended that Pitt “discontinue. or

modify” the use of academic titles

for ROTC instructors, and that the

question of academic credit he

decided by each school individu-‘
ally.

Six months later, in line with this
and after extensive

ROTC

At present, the Schools of

Pharmacy, Business, and the
Health Related Professions also
deny credit for Military Science
courses, while the Schools of
. Education, General Studies, En-
' gineering and Nursing all give
some credit for ROTC courses.

A WORD FROM
THE OPPOSITION

I A number of FAS members take

akﬁrm stand against relaxing the
present policy of “no credit’? for
ROTC courses. In general, their
arguments are much the same as
those which dominated the FAS in
1968 and led to the termination of
credit for these courses. However,
in recent weeks some of these
views seem to have been distorted. '

Apparently, whether these

courses meet some sort of vague
standards,
structors are qualiﬁed, is not and
has never been a major-issue.

member who actively opposed
credit for ROTC in 1968, made this
clear in saying “We never said the
ROTC had a Mickey Mouse
curriculum.” And he insisted that
claims like this have “lost the
ﬂavor of the real argument.”
What is the real argument? It
seems it is how a student’s freedom

is restricted by the ROTC - through _

the signing of a contract after two

years, and by regulation of the

courses and their content by
military leaders far from Pitt...in
Washington, DC.

which appeared‘ in the Point on

Pitt physics profess_or, John
Townsend was on the FAS

Committee to Study ROTC in1970‘

and is still in complete opposition
to giving credit for R0.TC courses.
He holds a view which as been
‘repeated throughout the entire
controversy. ‘

“I’m not saying the military is.
But by its very
it has /to‘ encourage
submission to authority, and it has
to be prepared to usemethods of
destruction. This doesn’t seem
consistent with the goals ‘of Liberal
Arts and Sciences.‘ Peacefully
coexist? Why not? But don’t say
the purposes of the military and
CAS are "identical. They’re in a
state of tenson.”

MILITARY PROS GIVE
THE PRO ARGUMENT

The arguments in favor of ROTC
credit are not merely a reassertion

lgﬂthe justifications ROTC brought

-.-u/"'ﬁ’f in 1968, which were conse-

quently overwhelmed by the op-
position. Certain changes in the
ROTC program, as well as in the
military's idea of the “ideal soli-
der,” have brought some new
points to light.

Colonel John Roehm Jr., visiting
professor of military science, ex-

fﬁitined some of the most important -

‘~.c-“aisons why ROTC -is requesting a

courses in the CAS. Paramount
was the‘ idea that the military
should be comprised of a cross-
section of the people.

“If we believe the military is a
required part of US society, and I
think we do, it should be represen-
tative of that society. And if we
really want the military organiza-
tion to be representative of the
nation, it must reﬂect the values of
the nation....which are developed
in Liberal Arts Institutions,”
Roehm said.

All military science instructors
have masters degrees, and the
academic quality of the courses,
Roehm said, “is such that it

 

period, if he shows causes that he
has to withdraw because of mitiga-
ting circumstances, he can. Last
year we had two people withdraw
during their senior year. But this is
the exception‘ rather than the
rule."

What about the complaint of a
threat hanging over the student
that if he doesn’t complete his
requirements, he’ll be put on active
duty? “The Secretary of the Army
does have the option to call him
into active duty, but this has never
happened to the best of my

Pitt's philosophy program.

BY FELICE NEWMAN
The Women’s Cultural Festival at
Pitt is an annual panorama of the
artistic, social and political pursuits

of women.

In the past, the festival has
brought to Pittsburgh nationally

“Let's re-evaluate the situation.
What are the reasons that the
ROTC shouldn’t be here? We’re
bending over backwards. What-
ever the academic community
wants, they'll get,” Rutherford
said.

It is apparent to the FAS that both
those in favor and those opposed to
granting cadets credit for "their
ROTC courses have sensible
points. And some faculty members
are well aware of this. As a result,
some FAS members, including
political science professor Richard
Cottam and associate professor of
history . Peter Karsten are trying to
put together an alternative to
present to FAS members when the
issues arises.

Karsten, one of the most active
faculty members seeking to pass
the “no-credit" policy in 1968, still
feels credit should not be granted
in the college, but sees another
possibility. i

“As an arm. of the government,
the ROTC is a strange being on
campus. -But I’m satisfied. they
bring into the service_more liberal
values.” The-solution, as Karsten

saw it, was to acknowledge the _four I

ROTC courses as "12 credits of
pre-professional schoolilng,”
something like engineering or
nursing.

Professor Cottam, co-author of the

' 1970 Report of FAS Committee to
Study ROTC, explained this con- .

cept of allowing ROTC to be
considered a pre-professional
school more fully. ‘

ROTC is an undergraduate profes-
sional school. Engineering isn’t
part of CAS, Pharmacy and Nurs-

ing aren't...and this (ROTC) is,

another. But I couldn't see the

, slightest argument for excluding it

entirely.”

Nor could he see.-any reason to
grant credit for these courses as
part of the CAS. “Things like
map-reading can't be classified as
Liberal Arts.” .

But to see students receiving
military training. while also getting
a liberal education, Cottam' felt,
was encoui-‘aging.. “I see as a
source of recruits more civilian-
minded people. The ones who
scare me are people coming up
from the ranks (such as OCS
graduates). Much of the problem
of the Vietnam War was that we
had" an apolitical ofﬁcer corps.”

There is one deterrent to imple-
menting such a scheme—if ap-
proved by the FAS it would still
require a revision in the entire
government military program in
order to allow the ROTC to become‘

a separate, pre-professional school ‘

at Pitt.
Although Cottarn ‘said he was not
undertaking this endeavor as a

personal mission, he thinks the _

answer lies in hard bargaining.

'-'I think the military» here at Pitt is

be glad to go along with the
proposal. “And if we have to, We’ll

ROUGH DRAFTS 3...the Pasiin Art

’ BY HARRIS LEVY
History repeats itself. The ramiﬁcations of that line aren’t conﬁned

 ‘Y to history classrooms but concern the arts as well.

Time are bad, everyone says, so they dredge up the popular culture of
supposedly happier days and present it as camp or nostalgia. They

'-‘-‘‘'''seem to forget the depression wasn't all Busby Berkeley movies and ‘
» there was a winter of ‘42 as well as a summer. ‘ V
 ' Revived interest in Marilyn Monroe has not brought her more

understanding. .-
Worksof art dealing with the past fall into two categories. Some

' artists merely try to recreate the past - since they have few ideas of’

~ 3 their own, their work emphasizes style instead of content.
, 0 , j ‘Other artists try to catch the spirit of the past, not its artifacts. The
’ ”. ﬁnest artists manage to infuse their works about the past with their

own unique vision.

The ‘Great Gatsby: substituting surface for substance.

sj ROCK: OLDIES BUT GOODIES
Oldies are an integral part of rock music. Some radio stations play
nothing but oldies and recent years have seen numerous rock revival
concerts as well as the restoration to fame of Chuck Berry, Little
Richard and the Beach Boys. -

I , The songs of the ﬁfties have been revived indiscriminately, the dross

7. as well as the authentic classics. Sha Na Na’s eclectic selection of

material seems to consider age a more important criteria than quality. ,

- Almost every major rock star has recorded some old songs: take

‘currents hits like Elton John’s “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” and

Linda Ronstadt’s “You’re No Good”. Bette Midler, Bonnie.Raitt and
Ry Cooder have become successful by interpreting old songs in new
distinctive ways. _

I Unlike, Sha Na Na, the Band doesn’t just revive old songs. On their
one album of oldies, Moondog Matinee, they performed songs similar

in spirit to their own compositions. Listen to “Share Your Love” and-

. “The Great Pretender” - both sung by Richard Manuel. Like Manuel's
own “Lonesome Suzie” and “Whispering Pines”, they're’ about
. '_ loneliness.

Earlier Band compositions like “The Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down” combine the mood of the past with rock instruments. ,

Randy Newman does this consistently. His latest album Good Old

. Boys‘ has some deliberately archaic lyrics. Newman fuses his evocation
of the_ Old South with social commentary about the present.
;‘Rednecks” takes on’ Northern hypocrisy.

MOVIES: THE PAST PICTURE SHOW , r
Rock musicians aren’t the only artists guilty of reviving the past
without adding anything of their own. Movie makers are also culprits.

" We got the trappings of the ‘Gatsby era without the depth of

Fitzgerald’s novel. Even a ﬁne film as Roman Polanski’s Chinatown
, does little but duplicate past detective genre ﬁlms like The Maltese

‘Falcon.

The Last Picture Show is representative of ﬁlmsthat reproduce the
surfaces of the past while McCabe and Mrs. Miller is typical of ﬁlms

' with a vision of the past.

Peter Bogdanovich, the director of The Last Picture Show, is content

I to show that he can utilize the techniques, the actors, even the plots of

films by his idols like Howard Hawks without giving them any original
perspective. Bogdanovich’s works share only an indebtedness to film
history and not a controlling point of view or philosophy.

The Last Picture Show is packed with period songs and movie clips
__but since Bogdanovich presents his material without having anything
.to say, the ﬁlm may best be seen as an exercise in style.

If Bogdanovich gives us a photograph, Robert Altman gives us an

' ’ impressionist painting. McCabe and Mrs. Miller is a dream-like vision
of the past. Even the hazy photography (in sharp contrast to Picture

in

  Show’s black-and-white) emphasizes the fi_lm’s subjectivity. And since
~ ,1 the film presents the perceptions of a contemporary director about the
 -, past, it’s more relevan't‘than vBogdanovich.’.s.superﬁcial.tin1e cap’$u.1e,. .

  

       

Ry Cooder adds his own personality to other peoples’ songs withghis
instrumental versality ‘and ability to forgotten songs that deserve to be
heard again. » 

THE TIIVIE FACTOR .
When considering artistic treatments of the past, length of time
“ since the era_occured must be taken into account. The longer it has
‘ been since the event took place, the more difﬁcult it is to reproduce the
paraphenalia of the past. As time passes, artists are able to see prior
events in a broader context, to interpret them instead of reproduce
them. . '

World vWar II novels have become less interested in superficial
realism in the 30 years since the end of the war. Early .World War II
works of fiction, like Michener’s Tales of the South Paciﬁc, were
realistic. Catch-22, published 15 years later, takes many more liberties
with historical reality and uses the war to present Heller’s ‘view of the
world. “Catch-22” . represents a universal.phenomena and is not
limited to one time or place.

Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five incorporates fantastic episodes
on another planet. Thomas Pynchon’s masterpiece, Grav~ity’s Rainbow,
published ﬁve years later, is derived more from Pynchon’s brilliant

imagination than post-war German history. The thematic similarities in ,

Pynchon’s novels outweigh the differences in time periods discussed;

The recent past is always difficult to present in art if real'events and
characters are used. Audiences remember reality too well. to allow the
imposters to be convincing. This is an even greater problem with the

- advent‘ of movies and TV which preserve the past.

This problem afﬂicted the recent‘ TV drama The Missles of October
which related the events of the Cuban Missle crisis. Memories of
Kennedy and Khrushchev are too vivid for the show to have much
credibility. Because we remember their historical ‘counterparts, actors
and writers were faced with a greater problem than would arise in a
program about George Washington.

Sometimes, artists are guilty of reading" the present into the past. It’s A

one thing to make an analogy between a ‘past and present situation as
Arthur Miller does in The Crucible. But in Little Big Man, Arthur. Penn

Geoffrey Perrett: Perrett picks up‘

the story of the last days of the

the war only as it pertains to the
activities of the American people at
home--the factory workers, the
profiteers, the farmers, the
women.

Of." particular interest is his
discussion of America’s witch-
hunting efforts in the early stages
of the war. Perrett seems to ﬁnd it

Americans were treated with
almost the same callousness as 

Germans treated European Jews; I

he devotes one of his 35 chapters to

Perrett is interested in all phases

his chapters deal with the problems

years between 1939-1945.

TELEVISION: THE DISPOSABLE MEDIUM '

A television program is like a beer can. It's only used once. Even
though there are re-runs, TV shows must‘ grab the audience the first
time they’re shown. ‘ ~
Unlike ﬁlms, books and records which may take several years to
become successful, TV programs must strive for immediate impact.
Combine this with the brevity of each episode and you’ve got some of
the reasons why most TV shows are superﬁcial treatments of
contemporary life. ‘ ‘

TV shows are actually little behind the times. Since many of them are

THE EXCITING CONCLUSION
The more an artist digs into himself/herself and uncovers his/her’ .

own feelings, the better his/ her work becomes. This is as true of works
about the past as it is of any art. A real artist doesn’t take the past at
face value like Sha Na Na and Bogdanovich. Presenting a literal
recreation of the ‘past is not art - what is needed is examining the‘past
through the artist’s personal sensibility. Picasso’s Guernica tells more '
about the past than a photograph because it goes below the surface to
present feelings. In reviewing the past the artist will learn more about
himself/herself. The better you understand yourself, the better you
can understand and communicate with others. And that's what it’s all
about, right? A

urs Blast Rollins, for zen. Win

»College on iWednesday night when he scored 12 points and added
seven assists and two blocked shots while directing the Pitt attack.

BY G. W. STEVENS
’ Sports Editor ,
Despitenan 8-7 record, the Pitt

. basketball team could very well be

heading for its second NCAA
tournament in as many years. The
Panthers ﬁnally cracked the .500
mark Wednesday night by blasting
Rollins’ College and their chances
of reaching the hallowed post-
season action is just within their
grasp.

Pitt is currently one of eight
schools in the ECAC’s Southern
Division. The other seven in this
semi-conference are West Virginia,
Duquesne, Georgetown, Navy
George Washington, Villanova,
and St. Francis (Loretto). Near the
completion of the season, four of
the eight teams will be chosen to
participate in a two-day tourna-
ment with the winner gaining a
berth in the NCAA tourny.

The Panthers are currently in
ﬁfth place in the division (when
ranked in order of records) but the
race is extremely tight with only
Navy and Villanova not currently in
contention. ‘

West Virginia is currently on top
by virtue of their 100-83 drubbing
of Duquesne earlier this week.
They hold a 9-4 record with the
Dukes close \behind at 8-4.
Georgetown and St. Francis are
battling it out for the third position

but Pitt has been coming on

recently making the race even
tighter. .
Fortunately for the Panthers, the
four contestants will not be
determined strictly by their rec-
ords. There are other factors which
will be considered giving the Cats
‘an. almost undeniable place in the
tournament. - 8
Besides their overall records, the
teams will be evaluated on the
basis of their performances against
national contenders,‘ their record
against other Southern Division
teams, and their performance down
the stretch. All of these factors
should favor the Pitt squad which is
hindered by a record which is not
necessarily indicative of the quality
of the team’s play. -
Pitt ‘ is presently 1-2 against
conference opponents with losses

’ to the Dukes and the Mountaineers

and a win over St. Francis. They
have just one game remaining
against a divisional foe, ‘their

Tourney Bound?

in
The

scheduled for February 12
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.

‘Mounties just barely managed to

gain a come-from-behind, overtime
victory over the Cats early in the
season and Pitt’s chances of
ﬁnishing with a 2-2 division record
is very good.

The Cats have also fared well
against some of the nation’s more
highly thought of teams. Their
wins over Marquette and Notre
Dame are big plussesand a win
over highly-touted Rutgers tomor-
row night will give the Cats even
more in the way of respectable
credentials.

Whether the Panthers will con-
tinue their torrid pace of the last
week and a half is the only
remaining deciding factor. The
Cats have been devastating at
home and seem to be picking up
the momentum to carry them
through the stretch run. But the
Cats still have not won on the road
and they desperately need a win
over Temple next week in the
hostile Palestra if they hope to
ﬁnish the season in outstanding
form.

So, the Cats chances of making
the Division tourney look pretty
good at this point. However,
whether or not they will make the
NCAA competition is completely
up in the air. Unfortunately for the
Cats, the divisional play will be
held in the West Virginia Colis-
eum, an arena which has not
exactly been very friendly to Pitt
over the last few years.

West Virginia is a sure bet to gain
a place in the competition giving
them a home floor advantage which
should make them tourney favor-
ites. Duquesne will probably also
earn a spot as will Georgetown, but
neither of these teams will be as
much a threat to Pitt’s chances as
will the Mountaineers.

The Dukes defeated Pitt 100-94 in
the Steel Bowl at the Civic Arena,
their home floor, but a neutral
ﬂoor, especially the Coliseum,
should favor the Cats. But Pitt has
never beaten West Virginia in the
Coliseum although they have come
very close on several occasions.

It’s still too early to pick the
divisionwinner but if the Cats
continue to improve like they have
over the past months, they should
ﬁnd themselves in another NCAA
play-off.

BY JIM SPAN OS

If there was ever any doubt about
the quality of the Pitt basketball
team, it has all been laid to rest.
Wednesday’s destruction of a not-
so-bad Rollins College team who
tried to run but instead found
themselves getting trounced at
their own game, was the third win
in succession for Pitt.

The Cats combined the right
mixture of speed, strength, good
shooting, aggressiveness, good
humor, and rebounding to improve

romp over the Tars. There was

-Kirk Bruce, maintaining his 50

percent shooting average, pouring
in nine of 18 ﬁeld goals from way
out yonder, and leading Pitt in
scoring as he has done in nine of
the last 11 games.

Lew Hill, who came in off the
bench with 12:38 left in the ﬁrst
half and the game deadlocked
18-.18, scored eight points in a ten
minute period. When he was taken
out with 2:06 remaining in the half,
the score was 49-24. The Panthers
and the Tars each scored four more
points, and the score at the half
was 53-28.

Pitt Hosts Extravaganza

BY RICK STOUFFER
Associate Sports Editor

It seems the best way to practice
in track is to compete in dual meets
where each member of your team is
trying to do his best.

There’s only one thing wrong with
the above statement. Not many
dual meets are run early in the
season. Coach Jim Banner looked
at the situation and instead of
sitting around and talking, he
acted.

The result is a five team event this
Saturday at the Field House which
has never been tried before.

“We are very happy with the,

Pantherettes

Lose First

BY ROBIN MILES

Trailing at halftime 34-23 last
night, the Pantherette Basketball
team found themselves unable to
come back and dropped their ﬁrst
game of the season to Ashland
College 80-63. Their record stands
at ﬁve wins and one loss. D

Pitt could not penetrate the strong
defense of the Eagles and were
forced to shoot from far outside or
risk turnovers. Ashland capitalized
on‘ these problems and lead at
times by as much as 20 points.

“They played better than we
did,” Coach Jean Condo remarked.
“They deserved to win.”

High scorers for Pitt were Mary
Ellen Klobchar and Kim Raymond
with 18 and 10 points respectively.
Gail Wasmus and Gweynri Hampel
each had 17‘points for Ashland.

Pitt will go for win number six
when they meet Edinboro away on
Saturday at 1 pm.

Bob Shrewsbury and Tom Rich-
ards, who alternate at the point
guard position, canned four and 12
points respectively, but probably
more important was the manner in
which they directed the Pitt of-
fense.

Their clutch dribbling and quick-
ness which characterizes the rest of
the Pitt team as well, was too much
for Rollins to contend with.

The play of Melvin Bennett and
Lucius Keese in the centerposition
for Pitt cannot be overemphasized.
Bennett rammed his way to 15
points, mostly on power moves in
which he left the defender unaware
of his whereabouts on the court.

The high-skying freshman also
grabbed 11 rebounds, blocked two
shots, and intimidated the Rollins-
team for most of the game.

Sharing top rebounding honors
with Bennett was Lucius Keese.
Keese popped in two field goals in
the last minute of play in the first
half, added five more points  the
second half, dazzled the fans with a
few near-dunks, and provided
coach Buzz Ridl with yet another
dimensionto the Pitt attack.

Keith Starr played his usual
brilliant game for the Panthers,

contributing twelve points, nine
rebounds and three assists to the
Cat’s cause. Starr andfreshman
Larry Harris provided the Panthers
with the kind of speed and ball
handling ability which Ridl "is
elated to see.

Harris scored six ‘points: ‘ a
bank-shot from 18 feet, two free
throws, anda running layup which
you could watch on video tape for
four hours and still be amazed-

As a whole, the Panthers connect-
ed on 45 percent of their shots, but

response to our proposal,” said
Banner. “All of the schools we
contacted were more than happy to
come and participate.” It seems
everyone jumps on the bandwagon
once you’ve stuck your own neck
out. o

The ﬁve teams conpeting in this
“mini” Pitt Invitational are Ken-
tucky, Ohio University, Delaware,
Allegheny County Community Col-

lege, and of course the crowd’s'

favorite, ‘Pitt. «

“When we sent word to the
schools we weren’t aware of their
records or who they had run
against previously.” said Banner.
“All we know is Kentucky always
manages to come up with a good
distance men, Ohio is good in the
middle distances, and Delaware is
strong in the sprints and the
hurdles.”

Pitt will use basically the same
lineup used against Kent State last
week. There’s no reason to change
a winner. '

In the shotput freshman Bob
Arthurs will again be called upon to
heave the leaden ball into space.

Banner has called Arthurs a man of .

“great potential once he gets the
basics down.” -

The high jump will feature Pitt’s
terrible trio of Dan Goodyear, a
freshman who captured the event
against Kent State, George’ Jupin

and Tim Riley although Riley is
listed as doubtful. 2

“Tim is still questionable as to
jumping," said Banner. “He hurt
his back this week and we won’t
take any chances with him.”

Jack Patrick and Dan Betterley
are both recovered from leg injur-
ies suffered against KSU and
should be ready to do battle in the
880 Saturday.

Ed Totin, an important cog in the

two mile relay system is another

 

more sensational was the way in
which they completely contained
the fast break of Rollins, who had
been averaging 92 points per
game. Like women who smoke
cigarettes, since the early part of
the season the Pitt amoeba defense
has come a long way, baby.

MELVIN BENNETT

“We're playing very aggressive
defense now,” Ridl explained,
“and this is causing a lot of
turnovers and helps our fast break.
We were very concerned with
Rollin’s running. game, but our
younger players have learned our
defense, and thishas helped.”
Jim Bolla, who after one of the
Rollins’s players punched Kirk
Bruce, proceeded to grab him and
send him sprawling on the ground,

questionable starter this week.
Totin had been on the relay squad
as it took third at the CYO meet in
Maryland and first last week at the
Field House.

“Totin is suffering from a painful

; leg strain and it’s not sure if he will

be" ready for the meet,” said
Banner.

The all around performer of the
Panthers this year, Rich Markley
will cut down on his‘ events this
week by competing only in the 1000
yard run and not in the mile. Last
week Markley showed his excellent
versatility by running in both
events and winning them going
away. ,

“The Golden Flash,7’ better

' known as Karl Farmer, (notice his

gold shoes and socks) is being
switched from the 50_yard dash to
the 440 where he should excel.
“We are going to try Karl in the
440 for the ﬁrst time,” said
Banner. “The idea is to bring him
along slowly.” The other teams
might catch a glimpse of the
"golden blur” but nothing else
once Farmer hits stride. .
/As in a regular dual meetithe team
score will be kept in order to
declare a winner at the conclusion.
Individual scores will not be re-
corded as in an‘ invitational.
_“The teams coming are tradition-
ally good strong track schools,”

., commented Banner, “Our team is

coming along nicely and this meet
will be- able to show how good we
are at the present.”

BY JIM SPANOS
Athletics consume such a consid-
erable extent of our lives that
constant evaluation and re‘-
evaluation of the goals, trends,
problems with, and improvements-

/;_av_hich might be made should be

fqjen intense scrutiny. It is
uncertain whether or not these

might be called “revolutionary” ’

times in the world of college sport,
but there can be no doubt that
many events are happening at a
rapid pace.

This is true for Pitt as much as for

any other university.

Inflation as well as other factors
forced Haverford College in Penn-
sylvania to drop football as a
varsity sport in 1972. Likewise, the
University of Vermont, with a
medium-sized student enrollment
of 5,800, dropped football in order
to save 200,000 dollars per year.
Increasing costs propose a problem
for every athletic department
across the nation, and the crucial

, effect of a lack of money is that cuts

must be made in certain sports,
much to the dismay of coaches in

was frank in his appraisal of the
defense.

“You can’t let them do that to you
or it will get out of hand. My job is

' _ to protect our guys and not to allow

them to intimidate us. We’re
working very hard on our defense
and the younger guys are picking it
up.”

‘One of the “younger guys” is .
Larry Harris, who is best noted for ,

his shooting and all-around‘ offen-
sive skills, but who has improved
his rebounding and defensive play
considerably in the last month.

Harris admitted that “the defense
is hard to learn and you just have to
play andwork hard to learn it” and
was praised by his teammates for
playing the amoeba well. ,

While Bruce Howland, Marcus
Wilson, and Gary Parsons scored
51 of the,65 Rollins points, Pitt had

those sports. 

0_ne proposal, which unfortun-
ately is too simplistic and irra-
tional, is offered by the Director of
Athletics at the University of
Wisconsin, Elroy (Crazy Legs)
Hirsch. ‘ v

“I think we should cut out all
grants-in-aid to all non-income
sports,” Hirsch stated last fall. His
statement is at once illogical and
contrary’ to the basic function of a

-university. A sport should not be

judged soley, or even predomin-
antly on whether or not it can make
money. The university is not a
corporate establishment, but rather
an educational system which
should encourage excellence and
competence in all sports, as it
should do culturally, academically,
and socially. As such, grants-in-
aid should be given to athletes in
all sports. . ' _

Casmir Myslinski, Athletic Direc-
tor at Pitt, pointed out both good
points and bad points in Hirsch?
statement. -_ .

“On the one hand,” Myslinski
said, “grants-in-aid are beneficial

‘because they allow students to’ get .

through school who wouldn’t
otherwise have the opportunity.

But ideally, if we. could get
through, I’d rather see no
scholarships. But we're in

competition with other schools, and q

we have to face reality.”
Hirsch’s statement presupposes

that there is something sacred

Rather, it should be-the goal of
each university to create, within
certain» ﬁnancial boundaries and
academic ethics, of course, the best
possible squad of athletes in all
sports. Because when this isdone,
you increase student interest,

public awareness, and you mold a '

State’s Joe Paterno, Darrell Royal
of Texas, and Frank Broyles of
Arkansas have recently supported
a return to limited substitution in
order to save money. Under
limited substitution, a player would
normally play both offense and
defense, as‘ is done in most» high
schools. Paterno stated that it
would be a “challenge" to football
coaches, but critics contend that it
would lead to a slower, more
conservative type of play which
would reduce fan support. _

, BY BERT ROSENTHAL
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK AP — Slugging
Ralph Kiner, saying “this was the
culmination of something I always
wanted to be a part of,” was
narrowly elected into the Hall -of

‘ Fame Thursday in his ﬁnal chance

by the Baseball Writers Associa-
tion of America. '

In his 15th—and ﬁlial year of
eligibility for election by the writ-
ers, the 52 year-old Kiner, one of
the game’s greatest home run
hitters, barely received the neces-
sary 75 per cent of the vote

4‘ necessary for induction. Of the 362

ballots cast by the BBWAA, he got
273 votes-—one over the minimum
of 272 needed for election, making
him the second player to squeak in
with just 75 percent. The other was
Al Simmons in 1953.

M Last year, Kiner had finished

.fourth in the balloting, behind

Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford,
who were elected-, and Robin
Roberts, who missed induction.
This time, Roberts, winner of 286
games during an illustrious 19-year
majorleague career, mostly with/
the Philadelphia Phillies, ﬁnished
second with 263 votes—nine short
of election. Bo’b Lemon was third
with 233 voties, and the late Gil
Hodges fourth with 188 and Enos

‘ ‘Slaughter fifth with 177. Overall,

37 players received votes.

“I suppose that’s why they call it
the Hall of Fame,” said the
disappointed Roberts. “It’s hard
to get into.” , '

“I was surprised to make it
alone," said Kiner, “because I
thought there were other candi-

‘dates who should have made it

such as Robin Roberts and Bob
Lemon. M

"I never gave up hope of making
it,"_ added Kiner about his many

. frustrating years of waiting, “but I
- _ did prepare myself for not winning.

“I had been knocking«on the door
for some time. There was no next
year.”

The gratiﬁed Kiner said he was
informed by a call from a member
of the BBWAA Wednesday of his
selection. “I let the phone ring
four times," he recalled, “because
that was the uniform number I
wore. I hoped it would bring me
luck.”

Kiner, who spenf most of his
major league career with the
Pittsburgh Pirates—he also played
for the Chicago Cubs and Cleve-
land Indians—was only the third
player elected by the writers who
played only 10 years, the minimum
required for eligibility into the

‘ Hall of Fame. The others were the
late Jackie Robinson and Roy

Campanella.

During his career, Kiner hit a total
of 369 home runs, more than any
player in history in his first 10 years
in the majors. The only Hall of
F amers with more homers are Babe
Ruth with 714; Mantle, 536; Jimmy
Foxx, 534; Ted -Williams, 521; Mel
Ott, 511; Lou Gehring, 493; and
Stan Musial, 475. '

Kiner also is the only player ‘to
lead or tie for the National League
lead in homers in his first seven
years in the majors. His best home
runs season was 1949, when he hit
54. He also holds the National
League record for hitting 40 or
more homers in five different
seasons.

Kiner said he thought that such
slugging accomplishments were

justification for election into the‘

Hall, despite a .279 lifetime batting
average. _ . .
“In my mind, if you dominated
the most important part of the
game, which I believe is home run
hitting, for as long and consistently

' as I did, it should merit election
into the Hall of Fame. Those
credentials should be good

 To Icers Set For Light Work  

BY STEVE SYBERT

Imagine the Boston Bruins
playing the Washington Capitals
and the Kansas City Scouts on
successive nights. What a time of it
they would have!

The Pitt Hockey Club finds itself
in a similar position this weekend
as it faces-off against two very
lackluster teams, St. Francis and
St. Vincents.

The Panther skaters post an 8-2-1
record including a perfect 3-0 mark
in the Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Hockey Association.

Against WPIHA “talent” Pitt has
connected for 26 goals while
allowing only three. Those totals
could very well be 50 and three
within the next two days.

St. Francis is showing the results
of a year’s layoff of its hockey
program. The Frankies are 0-3 and
have been outscored 31-4 by the

opposition. Coach Jerry Corle’s'

club, weak in all departments, is in
for a long season. . '

The Frankies have two strong
goaltenders in John Novak and
Dave'Coi-reia, but they cannot carry
a load caused by the weak defense.
With powerful Pitt as the foe in its
next two outings, St. Francis won't
even have a prayer on which to rely
for help. '

St. Vincent is currently 3-2, but its
record is misleading. The Bearcats’
victories were over hapless St.
Francis and Penn State-

McKeesport. 8-3 losses to Carne- -

gie-Mellon and Duquesne (an 11-1

victim of Pitt’s) are truer indica-
tions of St. Vincent’s ability.
Two players though could give the
Panthers trouble. Sophomore cen-
ter Dave Vance appears headed for

. his second league All-Star selection

with 11 goals and eight assists to
date. Freshman left wing Roland
DeFelice [7-9-16] adds punch to the
Bearcat attack.

Pitt, meanwhile, is mowing down
the weaker teams in preparation for
showdown with
CMU, the Panthers’ closest
wpiha rival.

Rick Vernon’s overall total of 20
goals and six assists continues to
pace the Cats’ offense. The trio of

Bill Gedeon (8-12-20), .IefflSaund- «I

ers (8-10-18) and Chuck Crisanti
(6-9-15) has proven to be- the
team’s top line so far this season.

At goal, the Panthers are
unbeatable. Well, almost. Johnny
DeFazio has yielded one goal per
game in WPIHA action while
facing only 28 shots from enemy
shooters. Pitt’s stingy defensive
corps deservescredit for keeping
the scoring chances to a minimum.
