Piﬂ siucleni victim of agg

By Mark Gordon,

News Assistant

A Pitt student had three
metal plates bolted into his
head after being hit by a brick
and punched in the eye early
Saturday morning.

Jeremy Stamer, a freshman,
was taken to Presbyterian
University Hospital where he
had surgery on his face.

“I had three fractures around
my left eye, and my jaw was
broken,” Stamer said.

Pitt public safety responded
to a call about a large fight in
the OA lot by Oakland
Avenue at 1:30 a.m. Saturday,

according to Public Safety
Captain Tim Delaney.

Starner said he and a friend
were walking towards the
Towers when he was assault-
ed.

“I saw 100 people in the
street, and the next thing I
remember I was being put on
an ambulance and I was
soaked in blood,” Stamer said.

He said the people were
there because they had either
just been kicked out of a party
or the party had been broken
up.

Delaney said no arrests have
been made yet due to a wit-
ness who had trouble identify-
ing people because he saw the

University of Pittsburgh

assault “out of the corner of
his eye.”

Starner was released from
the hospital yesterday morn-
ing and said that he has some
dizziness and that his face is
swollen.

Starner said he was helped
at the scene by a female who
later came to visit him at the
hospital and explain what hap-
pened. He said she told him
that she wanted to help, even
though she was risking her
life.

The individual who helped
him told The Pitt News she
did not want to come forward
with her name because she
feared for her own safety, say-

ing the crime was gang-relat-
ed.

“I risked my life, but he
really needed help.” she said.
“I really feel that no one else
would have helped him.”

She said she saw the victim
lying on the ground. and half
of his body was underneath a
car. She waited 30 seconds,
and when he did not move she
ran over to him, told him her
name and said he was going to
be all right. She said that at
that point Starner started to go
into convulsions.

“He must have been really
scared or in shock,” she said.
“The police came in two or
three minutes after that.”

P.R.I.M.E. helps

Former leaders of Aryan Nations visits Pih‘

By Max Baskin and

The Pitt News

Pitt alumna Nicole Narvaez found her-
self in a bind this summer when her job
with Home‘s department stores was liq-
uidated in the Lazarus buyout.

In search of a new job, she enlisted the
services of P.R.I.M.E., Placement
Referral and Information for Minority
Employment.

“P.R.I.M.E. is a great way to get your
resume in the door,” said Narvaez, who
is now working as a management analyst
for the federal government, a job she
found through P.R.I.M.E.

Due to affirmative action programs as
well as changing social and political-cul-
tural values, many employers in the
1990s find themselves actively seeking
and recruiting qualified minorities like

Nicole Narvaez to fill job opportunities.

For two years, Floyd Cochran was the
spokesman for Aryan Nations, a violent
neo—Nazi, anti-Semitic group that was
involved in murders, bombings and shoot-
outs with law enforcement officers. He left
when he was told his son had to be killed
because he has a birth defect.

Now, Cochran said he travels across the
country speaking out against bigotry and
about what he calls “the state of organized
racism.” Yesterday, he spoke to two classes

on campus about the prevalence of racism '

across the country and here in
Pennsylvania. '

According to Cochran, racist groups can
be found almost anywhere in the country
and are especially active in Pennsylvania.
He said Pennsylvania played host to the
largest skinhead gathering in North America
and that this state has over 40 operating
racist organizations, the second highest total
of any state east of the Mississippi River.

He also said a 50-acre white supremacist
compound has been built outside. of

Allentown, identical to the Aryan Nations
compound in Idaho. Cochran believes such
a compound could be used by racist organi-
zations from the entire East Coast to plan
strategy. As a result, the violence Aryan
Nations has engaged in could develop in
Pennsylvania.

“Organized racism is alive and doing very
well here,” Cochran said.

Cochran said he believes many people
don’t take racist organizations seriously
enough.

“When most people think of organized
racism,” he said, “two things come to mind.
They either think, ‘It’s not here,’ or ‘We
have nothing to worry about. These people
are morons, and no one is listening to
them.”’

But Cochran said that kind of attitude

allows these groups to develop and grow. “I --

spent 24 hours a day, seven days a week
working on recruiting messages,” he said.
“If you took the stand that I was an idiot,
you left the playing field up to me, and in
time you would respond to me. I was igno-
rant; I wasn’t illiterate. Simply because I

“This trip is more than a

Clinton said. “It’s an oppor-

Proposition 186 on the

goes further than President

You may h_aVe heard of
“the hidden job market.”
A majority of jobs are not
advertised through want
ads or job postings.
Employers often fill
vacancies through internal
transfers and promotions,
referrals from other
employees or recommen-
dations from professional
associates.

If you’re currently in the
midst of a job search cam-
paign, it’s important to

 

keep this fact in mind.
Relying solely on the
Sunday newspaper for
leads just won’t work. You
need to be proactive, to
work on getting your name
and your qualifications out
there into the marketplace.
Look at it this way —— the

One of the best ways to
do this is by letting family,

ers know about your

Rather than trying to look
for a specific company or

belonged to a hate group didn’t
mean I wasn’t using some kind
of intellectual capacity.”

Cochran said groups such as
the Aryan Nations recruit
members from all ages and
backgrounds. However, most
members are between the ‘ages
of 14-25, and many are well
educated. He said the mes-
sages used to reach people are
often very personal and well-
designed for each community.

“When I went into a commu-
nity to recruit people,”
Cochran said, “I didn’t go into
Pittsburgh or any other com-
munity and talkabout Adolph
Hitler or putting on a [Ku
Klux] Klan robe or playing
with swastikas. I used whatev-
er local issue would attract
people to listen.”

Cochran also said these
groups use religious arguments
to reach people and indoctri-
nate new members. He said
many racist organizations look
for passages from the Bible
and interpret them for their
own goals. The use of religious
messages is so important that a
new religion has developed,
the Christian Identity Faith.
Cochran said that through an
organized and recognized reli-
gion, racist groups receive
greater legal protections and
gain the ability to speak to
many different organizations.
He said some groups have
been invited into schools and
prisons to present their mes-
sages.

“There isn’t a focus on the
giving, redeeming qualities of
Jesus Christ,” Cochran said. “It
commands people to go out
and exterminate other people
in the name of God. White
people, and white people only,
are the sons and daughters of
God. Jewish people and people

of color are the literal, living_

embodiment of Satan.
Therefore, they are command-
ed to eliminate or exterminate
the children of Satan.”

Cochran said he was a mem-
ber of the Aryan Nations for
several years, but he was not
very active with the group
until he moved to its com-
pound in 1990. After his supe-
riors told him his son would
have to be killed, he spent sev-
eral months considering leav-
ing the group, a decision he
found difficult to make. He
said the organization gave him
a sense of self-esteem and
worth which he had been
unable to find before.
However, in July 1992 he left

specific plans for IFC housing concern-
ing what community residents call “ille-
gal” fraternities.

“Our complaint was that they
[community residents] have been
telling us for years about this prob-
lem, and now we have a chance to
solve it,_” said Brian Rifkin, president of
IFC.

A new revision of the Master Space
Plan now includes language about want-
ing to see more Greek housing on cam-
pus said Jim DeAngelis, co-chairman of
Plant Utilization and, Planning
Committee (PUP). The needs of frater-
nities are included a little more explicit-
ly, he added.

The term “illegal” refers to frater-
nity houses that don’t coincide with
zoning laws because they either are not
more than 300 feet from an academic
building or do not have a fraternity
occupancy permit, said Jay Roling of
PUP.

Community residents have argued
that fraternities which hold social func-
tions and parties at unzoned apart-

ments in residential areas are illegal

and a problem about which the
University of Pittsburgh should take
action.

“The problem is that there are lots of
unmet housing demands at Pitt, and the
Greeks are only a small percent,” said
Robin Jones Pitt’s director of Urban
Studies.

“But there is a large amount of pres-
sure from the community to deal with
the fraternity housing problems.”

Rifkin agreed that housing is needed
for many other specialty groups as well
as undergraduates.

The one thing that sets the IFC
apart from other specialty groups is that
it is a private organization with its own
capital and can help put up money, he
said.

“The IFC is a social organization
whose main function is to hold social
activities. Houses are needed to hold
chapter activities, programs and rituals.
Without a house, [chapters] are forced
to hold social functions in unzoned
areas,” said Rifkin.

There are five fraternity houses locat-

ed on North Dithridge Street, and two
are deemed “illegal.”

One house is a boarding house
owned by alumni of that fraternity
with only brothers living there, and
the other is an apartment complex
with three separate apartments in it.
Some fraternity brothers live in one
of the apartments in the complex,
and the rest live in a suite in
Brackenridge.

Parties and social functions are held
in the apartment, because “suites aren’t
sufficient,” said Rifkin.

IFC recommended to PUP that houses
be built on the hill directly underneath

the hillside where other fraternity hous-

es were moved to in 1984.

“This way they would all be located
in one place and isolated from a resi-
dential area,” said Rifkin

Ten chapters are without houses, and
the IFC is hoping to build that many
throughout the duration of the Master
Space Plan. _

Rifkin said he will be attending anoth-
er PUP meeting today to discuss all spe-
cialty housing in detail. ’

Meanwhile, graduating
minority students are forced to
face tough competition in
today’s narrowing job market.

“P.R.I.M.E. exists to bring
these two groups together, to
assist not onlystudents seek-
ing jobs. but employers seek-
ing minority employees as
well,” said Freida Kinney, the
Pitt placement counselor in
charge of P.R.I.M.E.

“P.R.I.M.E. is open to stu-
dents who identify themselves
with [any] minority,” said
Kinney, although racial
minoritiesare the most com-
mon beneficiaries of its ser-
vices.

The program helps under-
graduates find internships,
pait-time and summer employ-
ment, and helps graduating
students and alumni, like
Nicole Narvaez, find perma-
nent employment.

“I would definitely encour-

age all minority students at Pitt
to take advantage of P.R.I.M.E.
and other free services provid-
ed by the university for their
benefit,” said Ms. Narvaez.—

“We’ve had students hired
by employers like Weirton
Steel, the federal government,
the University of Pittsburgh
and Allegheny Power [among
many others]  for jobs titles
like software engineer, sales
representative and admissions
counsellor,” said Kinney.

Kinney also said on Oct. 27,
the program will be holding its
annual seminar which “gives
students an opportunity to
meet minority professionals
who might serve as role mod-
els.” She added that “it is
important for students to get
started early” when searching
for employment opportunities
after graduation.

The program is affiliated
with the University Placement
Office.

the Aryan Nations compound
and spent the next four months
living in a tent.

“I had no friends -— no one
to talk to. I was spiritually and
morally cut off from every-
thing,” he said. “I went ‘from
milking cows in upstate New
York to the cover of Newsweek
in six months. Those are things
I thought about while I was in
that tent.”

For Cochran, the transition
from being racist to being a
person who speaks out against
that very topic has been far
from easy. He said changing
his past beliefs has been diffi-
cult, and he is sometimes
haunted with memories from
his past. He has been threat-
ened by various racist organi-
zations, and on one occasion he
was threatened with a gun min-
utes before appearing on a talk
show. ,

While he said he has never
physically acted violently
toward another person, he still
has trouble overcoming his
own participation in the vio-
lence and hatred the Aryan

Nations promoted.

“One of the things I’ve had
to struggle with on a very per-
sonal level was not the fact that
I ever went out and killed
someone,” he said. “There are
no degrees of bigotry and
racism. I made hate sound
palatable with a video camera,
and people responded.
Therefore, I was just as guilty
as if I pulled the trigger.”

Cochran said many people,
especially in Pennsylvania,
believe racist organizations will
not affect them and will vanish
on their own. “The idea is if we
don’t say anything, these peo-
ple will go away. But we
haven’t been saying anything
for 20 years and these people
haven’t gone away. [Hate
groups] continue to grow.”

Michael Katz, a junior in
the History of Jews in the
United States class Cochran
spoke to said he thought the
presentation was very educa-
tional. “I learned a lot about
how other people think in
terms of hate,” he said, “and
how much willpower it takes to
change.”

ground”). If people know
something about your back-
ground, they’ll feel more
comfortable about mention-
ing you to any potential
employers whom they know.

Next, you need to work on
going to the recruiters rather
than waiting for them to
come to you. Keep your eyes
open for job fairs" or seminars
that will give you the chance
to talk with company repre-
sentatives. Look for unex-
pected opportunities; for
example, a company repre-
sentative may be invited to

‘speak at one of your classes.

Don’t discount the value of
face-to—face meetings. Even
a minute or two of conversa-
tion is much better than sim-
ply mailing a resume and
cover letter.

If you’re a graduating stu-
dent, an excellent opportuni-
ty to meet recruiters is
through attendance at brief-
ing sessions. These compa-
ny-sponsored events are held
on the evening before the
actual interviews to allow
recruiters an opportunity to
talk about their organization
and to answer any questions
that candidates may have. In
general, these briefing ses-
sions are open to all graduat-
ing students. For more infor-
mation, call the Placement
Service at 648-7130.

Finally, keep your eye on
the news. Make it a habit to
look through the business
section of the local papers.
That’s usually where you’ll

, find information about ‘up-

and-coming’, rapidly-grow-
ing small to medium-sized
companies. It stands to rea-
son that if these companies
are expanding, they may be
thinking about hiring more
employees in the near future.
Scan the news articles for
names of company officials
and write to these individu-
als. Mention the article and
describe your background
and qualifications. Your goal
is to make yourself known to
a company BEFORE it runs
an ad. That way, you may be
the leading candidate as soon
as a job opens up.

By looking beyond the
want ads, you can increase
the effectiveness of your job
search campaign. If you need

Opinions

Election draws near

Tick-tock, tick-tock. The countdown to the Nov. 8 mid-presi-
dential term elections is upon us. Many politicians and spin-
doctors are calling this election the most important of a genera-
tion. Elections usually tend to get over-hyped as they approach,
but this year’s elections very likely deserve the attention.

The stakes are control of the House of Representatives and the
Senate. Both are currently in the hands of the Democrats and
have been for eight years. In the Senate, the Democrats hold a
slim 56-44 majority. The Republicans would need to capture
seven of the 35 seats being contested to regain the majority they
last held in 1986. One of those crucial races is the Pennsylvania
senatorial race between Senator Harris Wofford and
Congressman Rick Santorum. Current polls say that this race is
too close to call.

It is generally agreed that it would be harder for the
Republicans to pull off a win in the House. They would need to
gain and additional 40 out of the 435 seats at stake to win a
majority for the first time in 40 years.

7 With less than two weeks to go, polls are predicting large
Republican gains. However, there have been signs of a
Democratic comeback.

Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, who has been in one of
the year’s toughest races, opened up an 18-point lead over
Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the latest poll. Also,
California Democrat Diane Feinstein seems to have solidified a
small lead over challenger Michael Huffington.

The White House has finally eased its way into the campaign.
Democrats’ avoidance of President Clinton has been an issue of
ridicule over the last month, but Clinton just returned from cam-
paigning for Democratic candidates in the‘ Pacific Northwest
before leaving for the Middle East. Vice-President Al Gore has
been outspoken in his attacks of the Republicans. “The issue
before us is not just who gains seats, but whether a deliberate,
protracted, reckless strategy of partisan paralysis will be permit-
ted to stop our counfry’s progress,” Gore said recently. He has,
not surprisingly, predicted that the tide is turning in favor of the
Democrats.

However, those whose profession it is to cast the political
future tell a different story. Both Democrats and Republicans

agree that there will be significant gains by the Republicans; the .

only question is how much. Many Republicans, such as strate-
gist Bill Kristol and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
predict a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate.
However, Republican consultant Ed Rollins predicts a
Republican majority only in the Senate, with a 32-seat gain in
the House. C

Democratic pollsters are being cautiously optimistic, believ-
ing they can still hold onto narrow majorities in both houses.

Finally, before anyone cites this year’s election as the doom of
Clinton’s presidency, it should be noted that it is customary for
the incumbent president’s party to loss ground in Congress dur-
ing mid-terrn elections.

SGB stance

This letter is in reference to
The Pitt News article “SGB
takes stand on panhandlers”
(Oct. 25, 1994). I believe that
this article misconstrued the
Student Government Board’s
position on the Department of
Public Safety’s, campaign
against panhandling.

The letter I sent to Rick
Boyd, Public Safety director, on
Oct. 24 (a copy of which was
provided to The Pitt News)
more clearly communicates
SGB’s decision regarding the
panhandling issue. The quote
from my letter “SGB supports
the Department of Public
Safety in its mission to keep
Oakland safe from crime” is a
general statement which was
part of the introduction of my
letter. Of course SGB advocates
safety in Oakland. This is why
we have a Public Safety
Committee.

I need to clarify the direction
given to the SGB
Governmental Relations
Committee. According to SGB
Public Safety Chair Patrick
Catena, the Department of
Public Safety is already plan-
ning on lobbying City Council
for ordinances that would pre-
vent panhandling. Since this
lobbying is already planned, the
board is concerned that it
includes student input, in the
form of Catena and
Governmental Relations Chair
Jodi Leibowitz. E

It is important for the student
body to realize that the board is
concerned with all students’
opinions. That is why we decid-
ed NOT to take a strong posi-
tion in either direction, since we
did not feel that we could prop-
erly assess the opinions of the
majority of our constituents.
Also, we spent as much of our
time as possible speaking to
students about this issue last
week and regularly came up
with division among the people
with whom we spoke. It

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

appears to the SGB that the stu-
dent body isodivided on this
issue, and since we are charged
with representing the entire stu-
dent body, we were conscious
of NOT taking a strong posi-
tion. However, the SGB has
read and discussed the reactions

‘of the students who wrote let-

ters to the editor in The Pitt
News and who called or
stopped by the SGB office to
discuss the issue. We hope this
dialogue continues,’ and we
encourage our constituents to
continue writing letters-to the
editor so that this topic has the
public‘ forum it deserves.

According to Public Safety
Director Rick Boyd, the univer-
sity will campaign to remove
panhandlers from campus, hav-
ing determined that panhandlers
not only misrepresent them-
selves as “homeless,” they also
are potentially dangerous. Says
who? For the last two years,
I’ve been walking the streets of
Oakland — at night — meeting
the panhandlers, listening to
their stories, bringing out sand-
wiches, clothes and blankets. I
never give money. Guess what?
No threats and no violence.
Kindness has a disarming
effect, I’ve discovered, and it
may be our greatest weapon in
promoting safety. Yes, many
street-people have criminal
records, but because of this,
they’re on their “best” behavior
in the public eye. Inebriated stu-
dents are much more‘ dangerous
to themselves than any vagrant
trying to hustle some change.
Boyd maintains that 21 of 30
panhandlers aren’t homeless.
By whose definition? In my
book, a friend’s hallway or a
“permanent” mailing address or
a room at the YMCA don’t nec-
essarily constitute 'a “home.”
And the fact that they “beg” for
a living, while fighting with
addictions and mental illness

and poverty, means that most
panhandlers are tomorrow ’s
homeless population. And
what about the other nine, the
ones that are definitely home-
less? Where does Boyd suggest
they go? Someone else’s neigh-

borhood?‘ In theory, the univer- V

sity is training‘ students to come
up with creative solutions to
complex problems. But this

new policy negates a built-in’
opportunity to put theory into

practice.

Local environmen

It was interesting to hear envi-
ronmental activist Robert Hoyt
speak about the Cove/Mallard
campaign he is workihg on last
Tuesday night. He told" of how
the U.S. Forest Service plans to

_ decimate this region in Idaho

with 145 miles of roads and 200
clearcuts. These cuts at a cost of
$6 million in tax money. The
Cove/Mallard region is essen-
tial to maintain to ecology of a
large part of Idaho due to the
fact that it lies between two pro-
tected wilderness areas.
Clearcutting would destroy the
wildlife corridor between them.
The important thing to note is
that this same destruction is
happening less that 100 miles
from Pittsburgh in the
Allegheny National forest.

The Allegheny is one of the
largest areas of public land east
of the Mississippi River, con-
sisting of 510,000 acres. The
USFS is carrying on its cam-

paign of clearcutting in the '

Allegheny too. Only 5 percent
of this public land is designated
for recreation, leaving 95 per-
cent open to logging. As Robert
Hoyt encouraged people to

stand up to the USFS and not -

allow their tax dollars to buy
tree stumps in Idaho, we must
do the same for the Allegheny.
Pay your rent, work for the
earth.

The Pitt News,Wednesday, October 26, 1994

ffirrnative action has failed the
AAmerican people. It has failed
us miserably.

It started out as an idea with good
intentions, a way of elevating blacks,
even at the expense of some whites, to
higher levels in society. Only the idea has
backfired: 40 years after the Supreme
Court’s unwise decision in Brown v. The
Board of Education, affirmative action
has brought racial quotas into everyday
American life. _

I say the Supreme Court’s Brown v.
Board of Education decision was unwise,
because it basically ruled that the oppo-
site of discrimination is integration. Did
anybody consider that the opposite of
discrimination should be non-discrimina-
tion?

The liberals behind affirmative action
obviously did not think of that. Neither
have the Advocates for African

J American Students. They said that the

Pittsburgh city school board committed
racial discrimination when it hired
Louise Brennen, a white women, as
superintendent of schools (Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette, Sept. 20). They claim that
Loretta Webb, a black woman, deserved
the position: “It is now clear that denying

Dr. Webb the position of superintendent
is to deny the black community access to
a signiﬁcant position.”

They say Webb is better qualiﬁed then
Brennan, but they offer no evidence
except that she is black. Forget about the
fact that in Brennan’s three years leading
the schools she was rated “outstanding”
by the board. If the Advocates for
African American Students were really
concerned about the students of

Pittsburgh schools they would not care if -

the superintendent was black or white.
Just like if President Clinton really cared
about his constituents (the American peo-
ple), he would not have wasted his time
trying to make his cabinet “look a little
like America.”

When Clinton got elected, he went
ahead withphis afﬁrrnative action promise
to diversify his cabinet. Only that plan
does not seem to have worked. out too
well, considering Mike Espy’s recent res-
ignation as secretary of agriculture. Also,
why limit yourself to the best black or the
best Hispanic candidate? When picking
the people that are going to serve the
entire country, these people should be the
best, whether they are black or white.

Moving on to something that is much

more personal to me, I would like to refer
to what the Dow Jones Newspaper Fund
did, only I’m sure they are not the only
ones to practice this politically correct
afﬁnnative action policy.

The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund is “a
nonproﬁt foundation whose sole purpose
is to encourage young people to consider
careers in journalism,” according to an
application for the summer inteming pro-
gram to which I considered applying.

On the front page of the application,
after after the space for your address,
name and phone number,-there is a sec-
tion called “personal information.” The
fourth question in that section, written in
bold letters, says, “The Newspaper Fund
makes a special effort to attract appli-
cants who are members of racial or eth-
nic minority groups.”

Is that fair? Because I am white, I
already start a step behind some appli-
cants. What does skin, color have to do
with journalism skills?

The application even goes on to
“define minorities as American citizens
who are Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific
Islander or American Indian/Alaskan
Native.” Now, I am Jewish. Last time I
checked, Judaism was a minority religion

6

Affirmative Action is a failure for the United States

in this country. Why doesn’t the
Newspaper Fund stick Judaism and other
minority religions into its affirmative
action plans?

However, that is not even the most out-
rageous thing I have heard about affirma-
tive action. Over the summer, while lis-
tening to a talk radio show at home in
New York, I heard an aid of the mayor of
Chicago, Richard Daly, talk about the
low number of job opportunities for
minorities.

“I think it is about time we stop hiring
people based solely on merit,” he said.
Stop hiring people on merit? Does hiring
people based on their skin color make
more sense?

Do you want your doctor, your police-
men, your firemen, your professors or
your airline pilots to be hired for any
qualities other than merit? I deﬁnitely do
not.

Afﬁnnative action is a policy that sim-

ply does not work. Just like its evil twin
sister, multiculturalism, it has divided
Americans into racial groups, not
brought them together.

Sexual Assault

I’m going to be very blunt. I
can’t really understand how
people continue to underesti-
mate the levels that some guys
will sink to in order to have an
orgasm. I can’t understand how
people accept such functions as
the “two-o’clock shuffle” and
“if at first you don’t, succeed,
buy her another beer” philoso-
phy, and I can’t understand how
things like the recent alleged
sexual assault at a frat house
could still be happening, given
the level of exposure and aware-
ness people are supposed to
have.

I’m not a proponent of some
of the campus vignettes I’ve
read about in the news, such as
finding random guys’ pictures
and labeling them as “Potential
Rapists.” This sort of propagan-

. da essentially says that “all guys

have the potential to rape,” and I
disagree with that because,
speaking at least for myself,
there are still many of us, Greek
and non-Greek, who sincerely
do not have that potential. But I
accept that a certain level of
scum pervades every campus,
including our residence halls,
and including — but in no way
limited to —— our frat houses.
There are several reasons why
I, as a guy, am so angered by
rape and other instances of sex-
ual assault. One is that I am as
horny as any other guy, but will
not take what I can’t get by con-
sent, and cannot accept that
other guys will. A second rea-
son is that I always think of
what it would be like if my girl-
friend (or my mother, or my sis-
ter or any friend for that matter)
was raped; how I would feel if a
couple guys trapped my girl-
friend in a room at a party and
took her body, used it, brutalized
it, destroyed forever her security
and happiness to get five min-
utes of selfish pleasure  The
most important reason, though,
is simply the fact that no one

has the right to put any individ-
ual though that much pain, hor-
ror and suffering. Subjectivity
has no place here, nor does
Kant, nor does Nietzsche, nor
do excuses or exceptions. There
is only a universal moral con-
stant: sexual assault is wrong,
plain and simple. So I guess the
only thing we can hold on to is
the fact that if those boys are
guilty, the f—--ers are gonna
bum in hell. (And yes, I believe
Anita Hill.)

BiGALA

As a lesbian, I appreciate the
need to be open about my sexu-
al orientation and related experi-
ences, to give support to other
people who are brave enough to
explore their sexual identity.

The Pitt News has been instru- I

mental in enabling this to hap-
pen, by professionally covering
BiGALA meetings and events.
Such coverage counters the
silence that isolates and trauma-
tizes gay youth. However, the
manner in which our last event
was covered was contrary to
official reporting policy and
obstructs BiGALA’s ability to
fully serve the university’s gay
students.

On Oct. 12, BiGALA held a
discussion group in which
members freely shared their
experiences of coming out. The
reporter was aware that this was
a discussion, as noted in the first
two paragraphs of his published
article. And yet, contrary to pol-
icy, the article mentioned the
first and last names of speakers
in connection with their very
painful, personal stories. As a
result, several new members of
BiGALA have expressed relief
that they did not contribute to
the meeting. Because of Pitt’s
inappropriate coverage, there
are now people on campus who
feel like they can’t even be out
AT BiGALA!!! For some stu-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

dents, BiGALA is the only
source of support for a very fun-
damental aspect of their being.
Pitt’s indiscretion has had
destructive consequences.

To assure that this error is rec-
ognized, and WILL NOT be
repeated, a large, public apology
and reassurance from The Pitt
News, on the front or editorial
page, is necessary.

Animal research

Last Friday was National
Biomedical Research Day.
Research science has fallen
under attack by a variety of
groups who bemoan its short-
comings or declare it worthless.
These groups are grossly misin-
formed.

We all know the litany of dis-
ease laid to rest by research sci-
ence. Polio, small pox and
countless other ills, once fright-
ening reality, are now the stuff
of history. But what has bio-
medical research done lately?
This year saw breakthroughs in
understanding the cause of
Alzheimer’s, Muscular
Dystrophy and Cystic Fibrosis.
In the last case, identiﬁcation of
the defective gene provided the
basis for gene transfer research
which will save thousands of
lives. Within the last month, two
major advances were realized.
Researchers have identified the
BRCAI gene, known to place
women at risk of developing
early onset breast and ovarian
cancer, while researchers here at
the University of Pittsburgh
uncovered a possible trigger of
diabetes mellitus. Knowing the
cause means knowing how to
screen for, and eventually cure,
the disease. ’

So the next time someone
claims that we have not beneﬁt-
ed from biomedical research, or
that research scientists simply
abuse laboratory animals, ask
them where they would be with-

out it. Very likely, the answer is
worse off.

Panhancllers

Two newspaper articles
caught my eye recently. One
was The Pitt News article, head-
lined “Not all panhandlers
‘homeless,”’ dealt with a report
released by Pitt’s Public.Safety
Department. According to a sur-
vey by the Department’s plain-
clothes officers patrolling the
streets of Oakland, two-thirds of
the panhandlers encountered (21
out of 30) had a place to live
and the 309 panhandlers investi-
gated averaged about 13 arrests
each on various criminal
charges. Therefore, presumably
because the panhandlers are
undeserving of loose change
and “potentially dangerous,”
according to Public Safety
Director Rick Boyd, Pitt’s
police force will soon launch a
campaign to “move these peo-
ple out of the streets of
Oakland.”

A Post-Gazette story, head-
lined “Economy leaves blacks
behind — Pitt study finds region
to be among worst in country,”
dealt with a report released by
Pitt’s Center for Social and
Urban Research. According to
the Center’s survey of local eco-
nomic conditions, broken down
by race, the per capita personal
income for black Pittsburghers
was half that of white
Pittsburghers. Further, the
unemployment rate for black
Pittsburghers was about three
times that of whites. Indeed,
Pittsburgh’s black jobless rate
was the third highest in the
nation in a comparison of the 50
largest cities. Finally, the pover-
ty rate for blacks in Pittsburgh
was about four times higher
than the level for whites, with
over 40% of all blacks classed
as living in poverty. Among
these same 50 cities,

Pittsburgh’s black poverty rate
was the fourth highest.

This brings us back to pan-
handlers. The panhandlers of
Oakland are overwhelmingly
black. It’s probably safe to say
these black panhandlers aren’t
out there on the streets just for
the fun of it. But Pitt’s under-
cover cops tell us that two-thirds
of them technically have a place
to call home at the end of the
day. I wonder just how rock-
bottom down a panhandler actu-
ally has to be before it’s OK to
offer a helping hand. But these
black panhandlers are “poten-
tially dangerous;” they’ve had
numerous run-ins with the law.
Why am I not surprised that
someone on the very bottom
rung of the economic ladder
might have been arrested for

one thing or another?

So what are we left with?
Black panhandlers, the majority
of whom may not be technically
living on the streets. But, from
Pitt’s own research, we know
they’re probably pretty badly off
anyway. And they probably
have a criminal record. And it’s
probably also a safe bet they
aren’t registered to vote in the
up—coming election. So these
guys are pretty vulnerable. They
can’t ﬁght back, so why not pull
push them out of the way?
Who’s gonna care?

Yes, it’s unpleasant to have
the panhandlers asking us for
spare all the time, and we’d
probably feel better if they were
out of sight and out of mind. We
would no longer be bothered by
actually witnessing income dis-
parity in action on the streets of
Oakland. But blacks in
Pittsburgh would still be three
times more likely than whites to
be unemployed. four times more
likely to live in poverty. The
problem would still be there,
and it’s hardly a “bold initiative”
to pick on the weakest.

Majors:
What else
is there to

prove?

or as

long as

I can
remember,
I’ve been a
Pitt fan. Like
most fans
who faithful-
ly follow a
Columnist school, I have
Brett endured the
F0lldI'k ups and
downs that the school athlet-
ics have been through.

At Pitt, the tradition has
long been one of a stellar
football program.
Unfortunately for myself and
other devoted followers, the
program has gradually eroded
to the depths of a Division I
doormat.

Now blaming someone for I
this degradation would take
too long to put into words, so
I’m not even going to touch
upon that.

When the university decid-
ed that the
program
could not
sink any
further, it
decided that
former Pitt
coach John
Majors would be the man to
lead the Panthers back to
national prominence. Many
applauded the choice.

Majors is a proven winner
who is respected throughout
the coaching ranks. He led
Pitt to a national title in ‘76
and is approaching 200 wins.
Also, most importantly, he
has the reputation of turning
programs around, which he
did at both Pitt and
Tennessee.

What is hard for me to
comprehend is why he took
the job in the first place.

I’m not questioning his
coaching ability, for that has
already been proven. But
what does he have left to
prove?

In 1976, Majors led Pitt to
the highest plateau in college
football, the national crown
and an undefeated season. On
top of that, he was named
Coach of the Year, and Tony
Dorsett won the Heisman.
How can he possibly top
that?

It’s also hard to believe that
he realized how poor the
facilities are here at Pitt.
Compared to other prominent
football schools, what we
have here is almost a joke.
Granted, improvements are
slated to be implemented, but
how long will it take to make
them first rate? There is no

Punter trapped in /inebac/<er's body

‘ At 6 feet 5 inches and 210

pounds, he could be a line-
backer. He even sounds likes
one.

“I laid a guy out against
Texas,” Nate Cochran said.
“This kid came at me, and I
got him under the chin.
Everybody was laughing.”

Laughing because Cochran
is Pitt’s punter. But make no
mistake, this sophomore
from South Carolina is a real
football player who happens
to have a knack for kicking.

“Most people’s conception
of a punter is some short, fat
kid,” Cochran said. “I’m not
really a punter’s punter.
That’s just what I did the
best.”

He did it the best of eight,
count ‘em eight, positions
that he toured while playing
high school.

Punter, kicker, wide
receiver, defensive end, line-
backer, tight end, defensive
back and even quarterback.

“I liked defense a lot,”
Cochran said. “I like to hit. I
like to be physical. That’s
one thing I miss about play-
ing a lot.’’

Relegated to hitting punts

“If you just destroy a team
in the first two games, it is
hard to get up when you
know that the other team is
not really doing anything,”
Alvear said.

“We were a little sloppy,
and they had a spurt. But it
is still not great volleyball.

“It is a good win. I will
never take anything away
from a win.

“I think our left side had

Hawkins
commits
to PII1

By Jack Becker
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt coach Ralph Willard
isn’t waiting around for the
early signing period, which
begins on November 7, to
land high school recruits.
He’s collecting oral commit-
ments right now.

Isaac Hawkins, a 6-foot-8-
inch forward from Istrouma

H i g h
School in
B a t o n
Rouge,
La., gave
Pitt an
oral com-
mitment last weekend.
Hawkins is the second
recruit to commit to the
Panthers for the 1995-96 sea-
son. Vonteego Cummings, an
All-American guard from
Georgia, was the first.

Hawkins averaged 18
points, 12 rebounds and four
blocks a game as a junior for
an Istrouma team that fin-
ished 20-10 last year.

“He’1l be like a steal for
Pittsburgh,” Istrouma coach
Hugh Wallace said. “I think
he’ll have one heck of a

senior year.” ‘ .

Crew sails at Head of the Charles

By Jeff Watson
For The Pitt News

The Pitt crew team pulled
in 12th-place and 24th-place
finishes in New England
this past weekend in the
largest race of the fall sea-
son.

Both the men’s and
women’s lightweight teams
competed in the Head of the
Charles race in Boston,
Mass. this past weekend.
The women finished a
strong 12th while the men
came in 24th in races which
saw over 1,000 boats com-
pete.

“It was an OK result, but
it wasn’t a spectacular
showing by either of the two
teams,” women’s coach
John Dougherty said. “But it
is very hard to judge results
against other boats in a race
like this.”

The Head of the Charles
race is one of the largest in

the world.

This race has thousands of
competitors ranging from
national team boats, to Ivy
League schools, to high
school teams.

Drawing spectators in
excess of 110,000 people,
the race gains worldwide
attention.

“To be in a race of this
size is always exciting,”
Dougherty said, “let alone
to be in New England at this
time of the year. It was real-
ly a spectacle.”

Away from racing, Pitt
also attracted a little atten-
tion of its own. A spark was
added to the weekend
while traveling through
Massachusetts.

As a result of an engine
fire, one of the team’s trucks
burned to the ground.
Though no one was hurt,
there were quite a few per-
sonal items lost.

New England, the Panthers
competed in the Head of
Ohio on October 1. The
lightweight men took home
a silver, while the women
missed placing because of
problems with their oars.

There are three more races
left in Pitt’s fall season
which, according to
Dougherty, “prepares for the
spring events.”

This weekend, Pitt will
head to Philadelphia for the
Head of the Schukyll in
which novice boats will
compete, in addition to the
men’s and women’s ligh-
weight teams.

The season will continue
on Nov. 5 at the Head of the
Occoquan.

The season will be round-
ed off here in Pittsburgh at
the “CarDuPitt.” In this
finale, bragging rights are
earned amongst the Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon and
Duquesne crew teams.

doubt that recruiting has been
hurt by our lack of facilities.
Majors is 59. By the time we
have the facilities to attract
big—time recruits, will he still
be the coach?

Which leads me to my next
point. Majors’ health is a
viable concern. It failed him
in his final days at Tennessee,
and it could be a problem at
any time in his stint here.

The stress of losing and the
expectations only add to the
mental and physical pressures
associated with coaching. By
the time the program is
turned around, will he be able
to enjoy the fruits of his
labor?

Adding to the problems is
the general attitude towards
sports in Pittsburgh. The fact
is, the fans here will only
support a winner.

The fans here are only
faithful to the beloved
Steelers. The Pirates and
Penguins are prime examples

of this unfortunate trait.

When they fall on tough
times, they only see empty
seats, similar to the almost
embarrassing situation at Pitt
Stadium.

Many Panther fans, espe-
cially alumni, who are used to
winning, are very impatient
to say the least. They want to
win right now. They expect a
quick turnaround.

I have heard a number of
callers on radio talk shows
calling for Johnny’s head. It’s
a little early to be so harsh,
but it would be hard to
believe that the university
would be able to endure many
more three—win seasons.

Now I’m sure that he con-
sidered this stuff when he
took the job_. All he can do is
try to weather the storm.

If he lasts and we get back .

to the promised land, that’s
great. If he doesn’t, I don’t
blame him.

Robert Morris Tournament
on September 18.

That match helped propel
the Lady Panthers towards
capturing first place in that
tournament.

“We really do enjoy play-
ing against Pitt,” Duquesne
head coach Ray Bobak said.
“They are at the next level
up that we are trying to get
to. The girls enjoy ‘coming
here.

“It used to be a real hated
rivalry, but now we come in
here and just
play ball and
hope for the
best.”

Pitt remains
tied for first
place in the
Big East with
Connecticut, as both have
compiled perfect 5-0
records.

UConn has a tough match
tonight against Seton Hall,
which has been the surprise
team in the conference with
a 24-3 overall record.

If Seton Hall is able to
beat UConn then the Lady
Panthers will regain sole
possession of first place in
the Big East.

It will also make this
Saturday’s game against
UConn even that more
important for the team.

“I think we will be very
well prepared for them

[UConn],” senior middle
hitter Alysia Yanik
said.

“I think that as long as we
are prepared for them and
we play like we did tonight,
then we will take them.”

If Pitt can beat UConn on
Saturday, the team will be in
the driver’s seat to capture
its tenth Big East title in the
last thirteen seasons, the
second consecutive one
under Alvear.

“We expect to be success-
ful [against UConn],”
Alvear said.

“We are
a l r e a d y
w a t c h i n g
tapes and
designing
practices to
prepare for
them. It is a game we expect
to win.”

Sophomore middle hitter
Jennie Driscoll shares the
same sentiments as Alvear,
and she expects bigger
things from the team.

“We are looking good
going into our final Big East
match,” Driscoll said.

“I think that at this stage
we are looking to win the
Big East and then go on.

“We are always looking to
win the Big East and go
undefeated, but our focus is
to go farther in the NCAA
tournament than we did last

Recruit

°From page 7

Hawkins had his mind set
on going to UNLV, until
coach Rollie Massimino was
bought out of his contract
and former Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich was hired as the
replacement. That move
ended Hawkins’ interest in
the Runnin’ Rebels. He
decided on Pitt over a host of
schools that included
Louisiana State, Tulane,
Kansas, Georgetown and
Connecticut.

Wallace said Hawkins
chose Pitt because of the
Panthers’ style of play,
which will be more up-tempo
under Willard, and because
the possibility of making a
contribution early in his
career was attractive.

Hawkins has been an All-

Hawkins saved some of his
best performances last year
against 6—foot-9-inch forward
Lester Earl of Glen Oaks
High School in Louisiana.
Istrouma matched up with
Glen Oaks three times last
season, and Hawkins poured
27, 32 and 30 points on Earl.
Earl is considered one of the
top three underclassmen in
the country.
