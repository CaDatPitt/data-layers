UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

KurtzmanPlotsChange,
Seeks Equal Discount
In Book Store Policy

The changes in the policy and operation of the Univer-
sity Book Center recommended in a student petition last
term were discussed by Chancellor David H. Kurtzman in

a recent Pitt News interview.

On the issue of a student discount, Dr. Kurtzman re-
plied that he has asked Assistant to the Vice-Chancellor of
Finance David Smith “to ascertain. what it would cost us to ex-
tend the discount to the students. My inclination is to cut the
discount in half (t-o ﬁve per cent).”

Dr, Kurtzman felt that if the discount ‘were limited to the
faculty only, I could understand. The present policy just doesn't
make sense to me, frankly.” He was referring to the current sit-
uation, where faculty members, admhinistirators, and -staff receive

a ten per cent discount.

“The decision on the discount will have to be made by Dr.
Posvar, and I expect to develop a plan that would permit the Uni-

versity to do it,” the Chancellor
stated. “This is the goal I am
working toward.” He remarked

that when he served on the fac-

ulty at the University of Penn-
sylvania, the same policy was
employed successfully. “I would
hope for a decision by _Fall on
this issue.”

Dr, Kurtzman made the fol-
lowing statements on other is-
sues of disputes concerning the
Book Center policy:

> Two-week time limit on re-
turning books: “The reason for
the shorter time period. for re-
turning books is to stay with-
in the publishers’ time limit.”

D The necessity of an add-
and-drop slip to return books:
“This is a protection against
theft. If a student has a drop
slip, he has proof that he brought
the book. We ought to. set up
a procedure where the profes-

sor can give the student a note

if he has, for example, elimin-
ated a required book, but the
book would still have to be re-

turned during‘ the ﬁrst two,

weeks.”

> The question of a coopera-
tive: “There is no room for such
a cooperative in the current Stu-
dent Union. If students want to

Smith Will Seek
Billing Solution
For Third Term

David Smith, assistant to the
vice-chancellor of ﬁnance, has
said that he is seeking a solu-
tion to the billing problem for
students carrying more than 15
credits over the summer. Under
current billing processes, _such
students would be paying more
than in a normal term for the
same number of credits.

“I don.’t think we have too
many students taking more than
a total of 15 credits,” comment-
ed Smith, “but we certainly
want to ﬁx it for those who do.”

Smith further explained that
billing for academic charges for
the ﬁrst seven-and-a-half week
session had to be handled as a
separate entity because his of-
fice didn’t know how many or
what students would attend
classes both sessions. “Many stu-
dents don't know themselves,”
he , remarked.

Smith didn't indicate what his

solution would be, but he com-

‘; mented .-that he would.-have ‘its

ed-

develop -a coop store to sell such
items as beer mugs and sweat-
shirts, this would have to be
worked out on some leased pro-
per-ty.” '

University Will Offer Course  

In Journalistic Writing in Fall

(See editorial, “A Key to
Quality” Page 4.)

The University will offer a
course in journalistic writing un-
der the auspicies of the English
Department this Fall. Listed as
English 145, the. course will car-
ry three credits, including ‘two,

lecture hours per week and one

hour of lab, which will consist
of Work on the staff of The
Pitt News. ‘

Lecturer for the course will

be Albert Bloom, editor of The '

Jewish Chronicle. Bloom is a
former science editor for the
Pittsburgh Pos_t'- Gazette, and
also a former assistant Sunday
editor for that paper. He has
also held the position of assis-
tant Sunday editor for the Wash-
ington Times-Herald.

During the war, Bloom spent
two and a half years in the
China-Burma-I_ndia Theatre han-

dling information services and
was also a member of the inter-
service Psychological Warfare
Board for the China Theatre. In
Washington, he served in the
Office of the Chief of Staff, cov-
ering the War Department, the
VVhite House, the State Depart-
ment, and the Department of
the Navy. Bloom was also a liai-
son officer with the'Office of
War Information.

ment of Journalism for ten
years. Bloom received his Mas-
_ter’s degree in Journalism from

DR. CHARLES PEAKE
Vice-Chancellor of the Academic Disciplines

by LINDA 'GOLDSTEIN
(This is the second of a three
part series on the University's

“vice-chancellors. The last profile‘

will deal with Vice-Chancellor
of the Health Professions Fran-
cis Cheever.)

The hectic schedule of Vice-
Chancellor for the'Academic Dis-

ciplines Charles H. Peake is‘

marked by its ﬂexibility in ar-
ranging time to allow him to
discuss pertinent issues with
Pitt News reporters. His intense
interest in the various phases
of student life at the University
is evident from both his aware-
ness of the students’ needs and
his keen desire to be informed
directly by the students.
Vice-Chancellor Peake’s pre-
occupation with student welfare
is remarkable in light of the
fact that the following areas are
his responsibility: School of Lib-
eral Arts, School of General
Studies, Regional Campuses, In-
ternational Studies Program. Di-
vision of Humanities, Division
of Natural Sciences, University
Press, Space Research Cordina-
tion Center, -Computer ‘Center,
and the Philosophy of Science
Center. .

poses even’ a greater challenge

exceedingly interesting at this
stage is our development of the
International Studies Program
as an intrinsic part of the edu-
cational program of the Disci-
plines.” He explained, “We are
making a concerted effort in all
departments of the divisions and
ir.‘ the SLA to expand the range
of study in various departmen-
tal ﬁelds to include signiﬁcant
offerings in four major areas of
the world: Latin America, Rus-
sia and Southeast Europe, East
Asia, and Western Europe.”
Vice-Chancellor Peake related
how “we have signiﬁcantly in-
creased the course offerings at
both the undergraduate and
graduate level in many depart-

__ments in these four areas and
have also expanded our research

programs.” He remarked that
these steps were taken “in an
effort to give our students a
genuine understanding of the
major cultures in the world.”

When asked about the chal-
lenge of his position, Dr.Peake
commented on the “impending
expansion in this University.
While this poses a great chal-
lenge’to develop the needed fac-
ulty and physical facilities, it

The Vice-Chancellor deﬁned
the course we should follow to
deal with this situation: “Our
planning must include concern
for educational ~values——how to
preserve the -.individual’s con-
cern for personal importance,
how to individualize instruction,
how to enhance faculty-student
relations, how to provide for
meaningful personal growth out-
side the classroom, how to pro-

tween the commuting student
and the residential student.

These concerns must pervade all .

WASHINGTON — Both the
White House and the Dept. of
Justice decline to say that J.
- Edgar Hoover and the FBI may

~ have reported to the President
on “anti-war activity.” But if a
- recent incident that occurred in
Pittsburgh is a reﬂection of-
wh-at is beginning to happen
around the country, there i-s rea-
son to fear a revival of the Red
scare, the Red raids and the Mc-
Carthyist hysteria following the
-two World Wars.

Here, as checked out with
James M. Carter, an attorney’
for the American Civil Liberties
Union who entered the case, is,
what happened:

David Dellinger, speaking in’
' Clapp Hall at the University of
Pittsburgh, expressed to stu-
dents and others the strong anti-
; war views of his small publica-
tion, Liberation.

After his talk, Dellinger . and
many of his audience went to a
party in the apartment of Frank
- Goldsmith,» a research associate

- for the United Steelworkers
, Union. Most of the guests were
young people deeply concerned
I over the Vietnam war. Shortly
* after Dellinger had left the par-
ty at about 12:30 a.m., Pitts-
~- burgh police raided it_. .
They had a warrant which, it
I 9 developed later, had been issued
12 hours earlier. It charged
Goldsmith with illegal posses-
.‘  sion of marijuana. When this

1 -charge could not ‘be substanti-
p ated, cold tablets found in his
bathroom medicine chest were
._‘cited as illegal drugs, although
 they had been issued on a doc-
) tor’-s prescription. Guests were
 , searched, and several who had
*_’-Vtranquilizers were threatened
- with a similar’ charge,-

 the wall a. poster bearing. a pic-

‘ture of Mao Tse-timg. They

wanted to know who this was.
A guest jokingly ‘remarked that
it was Ho Chi Minh before he
went on a diet. When the pic-,
ture was produced in magis-
trate’s court, it was identiﬁed as
a picture of Ho. ‘

Goldsmith and 52 others were
taken in patrol cars to the po-
lice station. The guests Were
charged with being present in a
disorderly house. They were
held from about 3 a.m. to be-
tween 6 and 7 a.m., when they_
posted bond. _

.One of those present at the
party was a-student from Ugan-
da at the University of Pitts-
burgh, Mahmood Mamdani, who
has won a considerable reputa-
tion as head of the debating

team. He told the officer in '

charge of the raid that he was
a foreign national and his em-
bassy had assured him that he-'
did not need to submit to arrest
when no speciﬁc charge was in-
volved. I
Mamdani swears that the of-
ficer responded" with, “Go back
where you came from, you god-
dammed gook.” The police deny

gook” was used.

Subsequently all the charges
were dropped. But they were
dropped in such a way that suit
for false arrest would be hard
to bring.

Those close to the case strong-
ly suspect that the police ac-
tion was related to the interest
of the FBI in Dellinger and the

anti-war faction on the univer-
sity campus. Both the Dept. of
Justice and the FBI say that
the FBI had no connection what-
soever with the Pittsburgh inci-
dent. More recently, 'an esti-
mated 75 police showed up at
a campus peace rally and ob-
servers had the impression they
were waiting for trouble to break
out so they could move in.

If this is the trend in certain
areas, in marked contrast to the
sgber way. the authorities be-
haved during the massive dem-
onstration in New York, we are
in for trouble. There is no deny-
ing that inﬂamed feeling on both
sides of the war issue presents
the Johnson Administration with
a painful dilemma.

' Thefar-out demonstrators who
burn draft cards and American

ﬂags arouse intense feelings of

anger and resentment. They are
certain to produce a reaction_at
the other extreme. This may
serve the purpose all too well for
some who follow the leftist ex-
treme.

Perhaps the Pittsburgh cops

is a footnote to the whole epi-

who led the raid, Iggy Borkow-

 HOW TO GET A’S
IN ALL YOUR FINAL EXAMS

In today’s column, the last ofthe school year, I don’t

._ intend to befunny. (I have achieved this objective many
" - times throughout the year, but this time it’s on purpose.)
The hour is wrong for levity. Final exams are looming.
Have you got a chance? I say yes! I say America did

not become the world’s foremost producer of stove bolts

» and cotter pins by running away from a ﬁght!

You will pass your ﬁnals! How? By studying. How? By

learning mnemonics.

Mnemonics,'the science of memory aids, was, as we all
know, invented by the great Greek philosophgr Mnemon
in 526 B.C. (This, incidentally, was only one of the inven-
tions of this fertile Athenian. He also invented the house
cat, the opp/osing thumb, and, most important, the stair-
case. Before the staircase people were forced willy-nilly
to live out their lives on the ground floor, and many grew
cross as bears. Especially Demosthenes who was elected
Consul of Athens six times but never served because he
was unable to get up to the oﬁice of the Commissioner of
Oaths on the third ﬂoor to be sworn in. But after Mnemon’s
staircase, Demosthenes got to the third ﬂoor easy as pie
—to Athens’ sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes, his
temper shortened by years of conﬁnement to the ground
floor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of sense-
less wars with the Medes, the Persians, and the Los
Angeles Rams. This later became known as the Missouri

Compromise.)

But I-digress. We were discussing mnemonics, which
are nothing more than aids to memory—little jingles to
help you remember names, dates, and places. For example:

Columbus sailed the ocean blue

In fourteen hundred ninety two.

See how simple? Make up your own jingles. What, for
instance, came after Columbus’s discovery of. America?
The Boston Tea Party, of course. Try this:

Samuel Adams firing the tea
Into the briny Zuyder Zee.

(NOTE : The Zuyder Zee was located in Boston Harbor
until 1801 when Salmon P. Chase traded it to Holland for

Alaska and two line backers.)

But I digress. Let’s get back to mnemonics, Like this:

In,n'£nez‘een hundred sixty seven

Personna Blades malce shcwing heaven.

I mention Personna because the makers of Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades are the sponsors of this
column. If I may get a little misty in this, the ﬁnal column
of the school year, may I say it’s been a pleasure working
for Personna? May I say further that it’s been an even
greater pleasure working for you, the undergrads of
America? You’ve_ been a most satisfactory audience, and
I’m going to miss you this summer. In fact, I’d ask you
all to come visit me except there is no access to my room.
The makers of Personna, after I missed several deadlines,
walled me in. I have no doors or windows—on1y a mail slot.
I slip the columns out; they slip in Personnas and such
food as can go through a mail slot. (For the past six
months I’ve been living on after dinner mints.)

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Personna
have not walled me in, for they are good and true and
gleaming and constant’-—as good and true and gleaming
and constant as the blades they make—and I wish to state
publicly that I will always hold them in the highest esteem,
no matter how my suit" for back wages comes out. ,

And so, to close the year, I give you one last mnemonic:

Study hard and pass with honors,

And always shave with good Personnors!

To Quality  

We owe a debt of gratitude to Mrs. Esther Kitzes, University di-
rector of Student Publications, for her arduous efforts to insure that
‘such a course would be taught. Mrs. Kitzes, who has taught journalism
courses, realized the importance of adding this subject to the curriculum,
in addition to the informal teaching she does in her day-to-day contact
with the members of student publications. Her work has now come to
fruition, and her contribution has been a signiﬁcant one.

We only hope that students other than those currently working on

is an unpatriotic party at large,
it consists of those who, pur-
inadvertently, are
helping to snuff out an Ameri-
can heritage——the right to be

different in opinion——and are

summoning the support of the
American populace through a

doctrine of belief through sheer =

“blind faith.”

IN THE 20th century, noth-
ing can escape the pervasion of
empirical analysis of merciless
synicism. We now live in an age
in which few, if any, things are
“holy.” Consequently, it has be-
come quite hard for many mil-
lions of Americans to believe
that the gospel emanates direct-
ly from the White House por-

cannot afford the expense of re-

Such a great majority of to-
day’s Vietnam protestors work
within the framework of our
civil laws that it seems truly as-
tounding, or possibly ignorant,
that General William Westmore-
land would dub them unpatrio-

because these dissenters wish
to see their nation do what they
see as “right” that they, against

student publications avail themselves of this opportunity. Albert Bloom,
who will teach the course, is eminently qualiﬁed to do so, and the course
outline he will follow is by no means geared speciﬁcally to those who
write for our‘ publications.

As Mrs. Kitzes stated, the purpose is “to give the student a funda-
mental understanding of the principles and functions to mass communi-
cations, a basic grasp of the techniques of journalistic writing and re-
search, and-a deeper knowledge of the interplay between the press’ and
many phases of academic and professional inquiry.’.’ We feel that the
appeal of such a program is sufficiently broad to attract students who
are either interested in pursuing a career in journalism or are merely
interested. in communications because of the large impact of the mass
media in our daily lives.

We are looking forward not only to ﬁner student publications but
also to ‘a more well-rounded student body.

Rainy Kentucky Derby Reflection.

The Derby Happenings

LAST WEEK, I had the good-

fortune to travel to the annual
running of the Kentucky‘ Der-
by, in Louisvile, Ky. It was my
ﬁrst Derby and therefore it left
quite an impression in my mind.

The impression, however, was
a double-edged one. To be sure,

_I was awed by the majesty and

overall atmosphere of the Der-
by itself. The spires of Church-
ill Downs, the blue tinged grass,
and the tension in the air can
neverbe forgotten. ~ "

Yet, there was another atmos-«

phere at the Derby that will
never be seen on the television
screen. That atmosphere hovers
over the inﬁeld at the “Downs.”
I think the best way of describ-
ing the “hapvpenings” on the in-
ﬁeld is a term it a giant beer
party. However, some of the
members of the contingent of
30,000 deigned to Wine or strait
Kentucky bourbon. Another big
drink of the day was, of course,
the traditional mint julep. Th-is
pungent drink which was sold
at the very cheap price of $1.50,
contained at least a pound of
crushed ice, a half jigger of
Kentucky bourbon, and long
leaf of mint sticking out of the
top of the special Kentucky Der-
by souvenir glass.

MOST OF the people on the in-
ﬁeld came prepared for the Der-
by. The inﬁeld at the “Downs”
was cluttered with blankets, gen-
uine Kentucky Derby chairs
(price $2.00), and large green
trash cans which were ﬁlled to
the brim with beer bottles.

by Paul Stoller

As theilafternoon pas-sed, the
“happenings” became more fes-
tive. By the ﬁfth race, the ma-
jority of the 30,000 “infielders”
were “feeling pretty good.” One

such person who hailed from‘

the University of Illinois said,
“Hey Pitt (I was wearing my
Pitt jacket) Who you going with
in the Derby.” V

“Think I'm going with Suces-
sor, with a side bet on Damas-
cus.”

‘-‘WELL BABY,” he blalblbered,
“you’re with me. Hot damn. Give
me ﬁve. Go with it Successor.”

I distinctly remember one per-
son waddling towards the cash-
ier after the six race. He was
so drunk he couldn’t hold on to
his bet stub. In fact, when I
asked him wh-ich horse he had
bet on, he simply didn’t_ know.
“You know how it is,” he blah-
bered, “got all dis money and
don’t know what to do with it——
don’t really care which horse I
bet -on.”

After waiting in the rain for
nearly seven hours, the 30,000
funseekers (including myself)
prepared themselves for the ac-
tual running of the Derby. With
a ﬂourish of the trumpets, the
30,000 rose with beer cans in
their hands and proudly sang
My Old Kentucky Home. After
the running of the Derby, the
30,000 madly staggered to the
exit.

Another Derby, of course, will

be run next year, and I will
gladly make a return trip to
the “Downs” — the “fun race
track.”

‘Pitt N ews’ Review;

“The Taming of the Shrew”

by ROBERT L. HOROWITZ

Can Shakespeare’s play be re-
produced for the movie media?
Director Franco Zefferelli’s ﬁlm
version of The Taming of the

‘Shrew, now showing at the

Chatham Cinema, indicates that
it can. One thing should be
made clear; this movie is an
adaptation of Shakespeare’s play.

‘ Shakespearean scholars and en-

thusiasts should realize that Zef-
ﬁrelli has not religiously ad-
hered to the Shakespearean text.
He did not rewrite any scenes
for Shakespeare; he simply re-
placed words with pictures. The
effect was a delightfully humor-
ous version of one of Shakes-
peare’s ﬁrst plays.

The, Taming of the Shrew
tells of two daughters of weal-
thy Paduan; Katharina, the
temptuou.-s shrew, and her young-
er sweet Bianca. Bianca has
many suitors; Katharina has
scared hers off. In order to see
both sisters married, their fath-
er has declared that Bianca can-
not marry until Katie has found
a husband. Petruchio, a roguish
landowner, has come to Padua

in search of a wife and her
dowry. He is to be the devil's
mate for Kate. The crux of the
movie deals with the prolb-lems
faced by Petruchio as he “tames
hi-s shrew.” ,

Director Zeff-irelli’»s choice of
actors is excellent. Richard Bur-
ton is almost perfect in -his role
as the lusty Petruchio. Burton’s

comic sense can easily be seen

when he attempts to convince
himself that he fears nothing;
meanwhile, Kate roaring like a

lioness, tears apart the room.

they are in. His voice and facial
expressions are excellent for

Shakespearean drama, and this \

play in particular.

Academy award -winner Eliza-
beth Taylor uses unique facial
expressions and reactions. Her
performance is ﬁne until she
opens her mouth; when she
does, she seems like an Ameri-
can misplaced in downtown Lon-
don. Slowly, however, Mrs. Bur-
ton modulates her voice and has
it well under control for her
crowning monologue, “the role
of the true wife.” Her perform-
ance is interesting, and at times

(when she" ﬁrst enters Petru-_
chio’s castle), shows sparks of

genius. Other performances-

worth noting are those by Cyril

Cu-sak as Petruchio’s servant ,
Gremio, Michael York as the E
youthful Lucentio, and Alfred ’

Lynch as Lucentio’s servant Tra-
nio.

Director Zifferelli’s superbly
coordinated music and action are
excellently combined with Mor-

.ris’ photography. Zefferelli and

the -Burtons have combined to
help make an evening of
Shakespeare look ever more en-

  1967: a new report on
the Velikovsky controversy

The large portals of science
are slowly but widely opening before
the non-convformist of yesterday. i

Over 16 years ago, Worlds in
Collision, the ﬁrst of Immanuel
Velikovsky’s books was published.

“There was a response which
for intensity and hostility was un-
equaled in twentieth century sci-
entiﬁc history," writes Robert K.
Kirsch, Book Editor, Los Angeles
Times’ (November 30, 1966).
“Yet Dr. ‘Velikovsky persisted
against massive interdict . . . He
had cut across disciplinary lines
seeking synthesis, utilizing myth,
ancient history. psychology as well
as geology, physics, astronomy to
formulate his cosmology . . . Yet
the new information gathered in
recent space probes has tended to
bear out his projections . . .”

David Stove, Senior Lecturer in
Philosophy at Sydney University,
writing in The Australian (De-
cember 31, 1966) on “Immanuel
Velikovsky’s theory, its reception,
and its subsequent conﬁrmations,”
SEYS3 .

“There is no more fascinating
story in this century . . . The sci-
entiﬁc establishment reacted with
unparalleled fury . . . So many
having made knaves of themselves,
it is gratifying that they have made
fools of themselves, too . . . Not
only have the professionals failed
utterly in their attempts to show
that this kind of theory is impos-
sible; since 1950 many of the
things which Velikovsky’s particu-
lar theory requires, but which
were totally unexpected on re-
ceived theories, have turned out
to be true. Jupiter does suffer ex-
plosions of enormous energy; Ve-
nus is far hotter than anyone else
anticipated; its atmosphere is rich
in hydrocarbons; its motion is
anomalous (the rotation’ being ret-
rograde) -— to mention only a few
conﬁrmations. Not one of Veli-
kovsky’s predictions, on the other
hand, has turned out false . . .”'

In particular, NASA reports of
the Mars probe (Mariner IV) and
the Moon probe (Lunar Orbiter)
read like transcripts of the sec-
tions on Mars and on the Moon in
Velikovsky’s Worlds in Collision.

   
 

“An intellect too big
to be ignored”*

“In response to the current wave
of interest in the theories of Dr.
Immanuel Velikovsky," a seminar,
“The Works of Immanuel Veli-
kovsky," was held in January at
Dartmouth College, under the Ex-
perimental College program. As
the seminar’s program said, “Veli-
kovsky’s works- have aroused a
controversy of major proportions
involving the entire scientiﬁc com-
munity." Dartmouth College pro-
fessors in Astronomy, Physics,
Biblical Studies, History, Anthro-
pology, Biology, Geology, Archae-
ology, Psychology, Social Sci-
ences, and History of Science,
participated in the seminar on
Velikovsky.

Yale Scientiﬁc Magazine plans
a special issue dealing with Veli-
kovsky and his work.

In January, 1965, Professor H.
H. Hess, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Geology, Princeton Uni-
versity, initiated and convened the
ﬁrst open meeting of the. Cosmos
and Chronos Study and.Discus-
sion Group, devoting it to Veli-
kovsky’s theories, their implica-
tions and reception. Since then
such groups have come into being
on many campuses.

Universities, colleges and stu-
dent organizations request Veli-
kovsky’s appearance. At Oberlin
and Swarthmore colleges, at the
Carnegie Institute of Technology
and Pittsburgh University, at
Brown University (debate at-
tended by.an audience of 1,300)
at Princeton University’s Grad-
uate College Forum, at Princeton
Theological Seminary, Duke Uni-
versity, Temple, Drew and Kent,
Yale and Brandeis Universities,
his lectures have-been attended by

, record _audiences and have left a
_ lasting impression.

He is scheduled to speak at the
University of Kansas, at the invi-
tation of the faculty,‘ and at the
University of Chicago, at the in-
vitation of student organizations,
to large assemblies. In not a few
universities and colleges his books
are required reading.

“Harmony or stability in the celes-

point of departure of the present
day concept of the world as ex-
pressed in the celestial mechanics
of Newton and the theory of evo-
lution of Darwin. If these two. men
of science are sacrosanct, this
book is a heresy.” (from Preface)
16 large hardcover printings

EARTH IN UPHEAVAL

“Here lies ‘the core of the prob-
lem: Did the earth change in a
slow process, a year added to a
year and a million years to a mil-
lion, the peaceful ground of na-
ture being the broad arena of the
contest of throngs, in which the
ﬁttest survived? Or did it happen,
too, that the very arena itself, in-
furiated, rose against the contes-
tants and made an end of their
battles?” (from Preface) 4 hard-
cover printings

AGES IN CHAOS

“Ancient history is distorted. Be-
cause of the disruption of syn-
chronism, many ﬁgures on the
historical scene are ‘ghosts’ or
‘halves’ and ‘doubles’. Events are
often duplicates; many battles are
.shadows; many speeches are
echoes; many treaties are copies;
even some empires are phantoms.”

Now Burrell Cohen, the executive direc-
tor of the Stadium Authority, speaks out
(May 3 edition of the Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette) and criticizes the University for hold-
ing up the show on the “proposed” North

’ Side Stadium. ,

In the newspaper article, staff writer
. . Jospeh P. Browne writes, “Pitt’s reluctance
‘ to commit itself to transferring its football games to the
y . North Side Stadium has always been a matter of concern
 ‘to. members of the Stadium Authority.”
'_ . THECOHEN REPORT states-that (1) Pitt Stadium
"is outmoded; (2) the home stadium need not be a part of

are problems; and (4) the university is depriving itself

 THE STUDENTS, “65 per cent of which will be living
in metropolitan Pittsburgh by 1975,” notes -‘Cohen, must

«the problem won't change. But for the resident students,
‘who now just walk a few blocks to football games,- it is
;''a new problem. How will they get to North Side, and back?
' Then there is the problem of scheduling. With three

climbing police barricades, were
speculating‘ on the condition of
the track, the previous time
clockings, and the respective

jockeys on the Derby hopefuls.’
One Indiana collegian within.

earshot explained to his date
about how Successor was the
best “mudder” in the ﬁeld,\‘com-
pletely unaware that the track
was listed as fast. A Western
Kentucky lass excitedly told ev-
eryone around her that Willie
Shoemaker had been boxed in
on the favorite in the third race
and that meant he would do bet-
ter with Damascus.

The shot had a bad day, los-
ing with three favorites. Not
only did he get in trouble in the
third race, but also in the sixth,
and also, of course, on Damas-

cus in the stretch during the
Derby.

One bette-r had been up $40
after the ﬁrst two races, only to
go with Shoemaker across the
board in the third, and see his
winnings cut in half. The same
fellow bet Shoemaker the rest
of the afternoon and wound up
losing double ﬁgures.

Another track buff ﬁgured out
the dozen or so combinations he
was going to play in the Daily
Double only to discover after
some consultation that there was
no Daily Double on Derby Day.
Naturally one of his pairings
came in.

Then, of course, there were

the handful of experts who pick-

ed the 30-1 shot, Proud Clarion,
to win the Derby. It's amazing
how scientiﬁc their selection pro-

cess was, after they had found
out he had won.

In fact, at least half of them
picked the number seven as a._
matter of habit. The others liked
-Proud Clarion because his jock-
ey, Bobby Ussery, hadn’t rode

yet during the day, or because .

30-1 was the most reasonable
-longshot.

The several fans from Pitts--
burgh loudly conﬁded to the not
so fortunate, about how they
had gotten the inside tip that
Proud Clarion was ready. “Dar-
by Dan never enters a horse if

it doesn’t have a solid shot,” one "

Pitt student revealed.
Unfortunately for the tipsters,

they remembered their informa-

tion after the Derby was over.

Pair With Syracuse Begins

ERIK LIEBERMAN (left) with a four and one singles record,
and Bob Salembier, with a 5-2 mark, are two reasons for the ten-
nis team’s winning season. The netters show a 4-3 record.

Tennis Team Hits Road;
 Winning Year in Sight

The tennis team, with a string of four consecutive vic-

tories, faces three opponents this week in their quest for

their ﬁrst winning season in recent years.
-In past years, as"coach Ben Pope tells it, “In some of those
matches the other colleges thought .our boys were just out there

modeling their underwear.”

But this year it’s different. The players are “like young colts—

ready to do battle. They're an-
xious. No longer is it an under-

wear show, they're playing ten- .

nis now,” he smiled.

Sporting a 4-3 record, the net-
men can guarantee themselves
a winning season by sweeping
this week’s matches. They open-
ed on the road yesterday against
the .“Grovers” of Grove City. On
Friday, they play a make-up of
last week’s “snowed” out match
at Youngstown. The road trip
ends Saturday with Slippery
Rock. —

Pope likes the “teamy spirit-
ed” look of the netmen. His
descriptive appraisal -has been
evident in the season's record of
the players. Heading, the suc-
cessful list are ﬁrst singles man
Bill Nichols (6-1), Erik Lieber-
man (4-1) and /Tom Stromp (5-
1) in the number fou-r and ﬁve
spots, respectively. Numrber two

of Nichols- Goldstein and the
number two team of Salembier-
Stromp sport identical 4-1 slates.

Schedule  

Ben Franklin knew what
he was saying when he pen-
ned the phrase ‘fNever put
off until tomorrow what you
can do today,” as the baseball
team is just now ﬁnding out.

When coach Bobby Lewis put
‘together this years schedule, one
of the things that pleased him
most about it was the fact that
the games were evenly spread
out, thus giving his pitching
staff plenty of rest.

But, the uncommon number
of early season rainouts has
changed all that. Most of the
washed out -contests have been
rescheduled for later this month.
The effect is an avalanche of
games, 11 in 14 days, which
promises to put the undefeated
mitters to a stern test.

Most of the burden will fall
on the same pitching staff that
Lewis believed he had protected
so well. However, Lewis also be-
lieves that the heavy schedule
will sharpen up the eyes of his
hitters, thus providing the pitch-
ers with‘ more runs to work,
with.

The swarm -of games begins
Saturday when the mitters face
Syracuse in a doubleheader at
Leech F-arm Field. Game time
is 1 p.m.

Don ‘Stock and Dave Welty
will handle the hurling for the
Panthers and, strangely enough,
what bothers Lewis is not the
fact that they are too tired, but
that they are too rested. Be-
cause of the rain, neither has
pitched in over a week.

As Ben Franklin also noted,
“The best laid plans of mice and.
men will often go awry.”

Wayne Tracksters Visit

Roger eHo1ly’s momentum,
coach Jim Banner hopes, will
spark the track team when

' they host Wayne State, out of

Detroit, at the Stadium Satur-(
day.

Field events start at 12:15
p.m.; track events begin at 1
p.m.

Last Saturday -in the Quantico
Relays, Holly ran the fastest
half mile‘ of his career. He clock-
ed 1:53 in -the sprint medley
relay. -

“It was his best time, his fast

est time ever,” claimed Banner

~ no switched the ea, 165 jun-

or -from Butler Pa., from the‘

and the relay events almost a.
year ago. ,

Against Wayne State Satur-
day, Banner plans to use Holly
in the 440 (at 1:40 p.m.) and
the 880 (at 2:10 p.m.).

Later in the meet, Banner
may also use Holly in the mile
relay (at 2:50 p.m.) along with

, Keith Stoeber, Doug Doben, and

Jack Neyer. .
, His two other choices for the
fourth position are hurdlers Tom
Christie and Dave Brinn.
Banner’s ﬁnal decision depends
on the runners themselves.
