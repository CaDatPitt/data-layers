Student Government Board hopes to
make its procedures more transpar-
entby requiring student organizations’
presence at allocation meetings.

At its meeting last night, the Board
introduced a new allocations resolu-
tion which would develop and enforce
procedural guidelines already in effect
for the allocations committee and its
decisions. It hopes the guidelines will

enhance the efficiency of the process.

Board memberPhil LaRue read the
resolution, which said it was “incum-
bent”upon SGBtomakethese changes.
Representa1ivesfromstudentorganiza-
tions are asked to attend weekly SGB
meetings, and when they don’t, SGB
has more difficulty making informed
decisions, LaRue said.

The Board recommended its po-
tential procedures become effective
immediately, although it will not vote
on the resolution until next week.

For the ﬁrst time, Pitt’s Student Gov-

ernment Board called on academic
advisers to help ﬁnd applicants for
committee chairs this semester.
SGB hopes to ﬁll at least seven
chair positions. Students can apply
to become chairs of the academic
affairs, elections, environmental,
governmental relations, judicial,
public relations and traditions com-

mittees.

SGB President Charlie Shull sent
an e-mail last week to political sci-
ence advisers Patrick Altdorfer and
Olivia Newman asking them to send
an attached application to all political
science majors.

SGB typically advertises in The
Pitt News about committee chair
openings, but Shull said he wanted
another way to reach out to potential
candidates.

“Academic advisers tend to re-
ally help, especially with SGB,” Shull

Dark energy, galaxies come into focus

Pitt professor Jeffrey Newman receives a grant to measure the distances to far—away galaxies and to learn about dark energy »

Tonyjovenitti
Staﬁ Writer

The idea of dark energy has mystlﬁed
scientists for more than a decade.
They know itexists and that itﬁiels
the expansion of the universe, but so
far, that’s about all they know.
Physics and astronomy professor
Jefﬁey Newmanhopes to change that.
He will receive a ﬁve-year, $750,000
grant from the U.S. Department of
Energy to develop a way to more ac-
curately measure the distance to far-
away galaxies, knowledgethatwillhelp
scientists learn about dark energy.
“By ﬁguring out which [galaxies
are] close and which are far away, we
can better probe and study the dark
energy,” Newman said. This dark en-
ergy appears to make up most of the
universe, but it has yet to be detected
and studied.
Newman, who will use the money
to pay graduate student assistants,
hopes to broaden the potential of the
world’s most powerﬁil telescopes,
including the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope, a 14-year project involv-
ing23 universities, including Pitt. The
LSST is being built on top of the Cerro
Pachén Mountain, inChile, andwillbe
available for_use in2014. Accordingto
its olﬁcial website, the telescope “will
rapidly scan the sky, charting objects
that change or move: ﬁomvexploding
supernovae to potentially hazardous
near-Earth asteroids.”
“The LSST will record how the
sky changes from night to night in a
multicolor, movie-like format. The

footage will allow for unprecedented
study ofelusive dark matter and dark
energy, which has greater pull on the
universe than dark matter,” according
to aUniversity news release.

wavelengths Newman said.

“The farther away a galaxy is,
the farther back in time we are look-
ing, which means we are looking at
a smaller universe than the present

This allows for us to look at a million
galaxies, rather than 100.

discovered in 1998.
“We can tell that the universe ex-
pands, andthatexpansionis accelerat-

ing,” Newman said. “Wewould expect -

expansion to slow; because gravity is
pulling everything inward.”

“But in fact, the empty space in _

the universe is causing the expansion
to accelerate. The empty space has
some energy to it even though there’s
no mass,” he said. “So dark energy is
the generic name for what is causing
the universe to expan ” . _

By studying billions of different
galaxies with the LSST, Newman will

’ help determine exactly how far away .

these galaxies are, and this will give

then it is close. Ifit has a red wave-

“The more it gets redshifted, the

said. i

colors provides a highly accurate mea-

scientists can only use this methodto

As a result, some scientists have
tried measuringthe distanceto galax-

said.

Two days after the e—mail went out, the Board
received three applications. Currently, SGB has
received 18 applications for chair positions.

Shull said that because he thought the e—mail
had successﬁil feedback, ‘he also sent it to the
business school, history department, psychol-
ogy department, engineering advisers and the
Honors College on Monday.

The original deadline for applications was
Jan. 25, but Shull decided to extend the deadline
to 4:30 p.m. on Feb. 1 to allow more people in
various departments to apply. T

Shull focused on the larger departments in
the University and might contact other depart-
ments later.

Starting this semester’s committees is a big
initiative, Shull said. He also contacted people
who applied for SGB board or committee posi-
tions. -

Any student who does not receive an e—mail
and would like to apply can pick one up at the

SGB Office, in Room 848 of the William Pitt

Union.

Students can also contact Shull at char-

lesshull@gmail.com.

Any student who tums in an application,
with an attached resume, and meets the grade
requirement of a2.5 minimum QPAwillpartici—
pate in the interview process with the nominat-
ing committee, which consists of Shull, three
board members and the outgoing chair of the
committee for which they apply.

If appointed committee chair, students must
complete ﬁve oﬂice-hours per week and pass a
performance review. The committee chair is also
responsible for attending board meetings and
submitting a project proposal, with a timeline,
speciﬁc to his committee. ,

Shull said a student applying for a position
should be willing to learn and be enthusiastic
about the job. 4

. An applicant should have an interest or a
concern pertaining to the speciﬁc subjects in
his or her desired committee, Shull said.

If a student does not become a chair, he or
she can still receive a spot on that committee,
if the new chair selects them.

Shull recommends that students interested

H1N1 hysteria
in remission?

he pandemonium surround-

ing H1N1 has, in these re-

cent weeks, taken a hiatus.
So, is the threat over? Maybe. It’s
been months since the early waves
of H1N1 pervaded every state, and
seemingly every city and college,
too. It seems that if a more wide-
spread outbreak were to occur, it
would have happened by now.

Amid all the hype, countries
purchased batches upon batches
of the H1N1 vaccine to prepare for
the worst. The United States has
distributed 160 million of the pur-
chased 251 million doses of the vac-
cine, and it hasn’t yet decided what
to do with the remaining vaccines
in light of the possibility of H1N1
resurfacing, according to Time.

Other countries also have a
surplus of the vaccine largely be-
cause their governments expected
a higher demand than was actu-
ally needed. The United "Kingdom,
for example, projected that H1N1
would cause between 50,000 and
750,000 deaths. Time reports the
actual British death toll stands at
400.

Some countries believe the
World Health Organization set
off what has turned out to be a
false alarm, and they feel that the
billions spent on ordering and
distributing vaccines shouldn’t
have seemed so urgent. In the af-
termath, the economics and ex-
orbitant costs are causing more
than a few accusatory questions
and pointed ﬁngers — but let’s not
forget about what was at stake: hu-
man lives.

Regarding global health pan-
demics, it’s far better to be overly
prepared than count on luck or
some feigned belief that a serious,
global, infectious outbreak couldn’t
happen. It’s unfortunate, however,

that less wealthy countries made
expensive purchases that easily
might end up being waste.

Part of the problem relates to a
former misunderstanding among
health institutions that the vac-
cine would require two doses to be
effective. Once it was discovered
that only one dose was needed,
countries were left with too many
spares. Then again, the whole pro-
cess of distributing the vaccines

_ could have gone smoother. Here

in the U.S., the vaccines faced mul-
tiple delivery delays.

The worldwide death toll from
H1N1 has surpassed 14,000, ac-
cording to the WHO — a signiﬁ-
cant figure, but vastly smaller
than numbers conjured up amid
the panic. Even when fears settled,
predictions were larger than the
current ﬁgure. All things consid-
ered, we’ve been lucky.

Should the disease grow more
stagnant and fewer new causes
come up, then perhaps the whole
scare could be seen as a test of
sorts. At least countries have
proven they’re willing and able to
inoculate their populations, if not
always in the most expedient fash-
ion. Still, we hope the world will
still take such potentially threat-
ening situations in earnest in the
future, even if it means spending
extra.

There were legitimate signs
of H1N1’s severity, and the hype
wasn’t a result of unfounded fear.
It was unusually lethal to young
and otherwise healthy individu-
als and spread even when ﬂu sea-
son hadn’t begun. While the WHO
should stringently reevaluate its
measures and orders relating to
the H1N1 pandemic, countries
should be counting their blessings
in human lives instead of dollars.

SGB, keepit all clear

Charlie Shull has made laudable steps toward transparency, but not enough

  
 
 

I Giles Howard
Columnist

Student Government Board Presi-
dent Charlie Shull started the se-
mester off right when he disclosed
the location of a traditionally se-
cret SGB retreat and promised
to increase transparency in SGB
through his “Behind the Glass
Door” program.

Before last night’s meeting,
Shull’s proposal last week to move
SGB meetings from the eighth ﬂoor
of the Union down to Nordy’s Place
was the most public example of this
“Behind the Glass Door” initia-
tive, but it won’t be occurring for
some time.

In an interview on Monday,
Shull said the plan to move to
Nordy’s Place is being held up by
the fact that SGB doesn’t have a
password and username for the
online room reservation system
that student groups use to reserve

space for events. Shull said that
he expects to receive a password
and username today so he can be-
gin working on reserving Nordy’s
Place.

But moving Tuesday night
meetings to Nordy’s Place is a
minor proposal compared to
the signiﬁcant change in the al-
locations process unveiled at last
night’s Board meeting. Speciﬁcally,

Board members last night publicly ‘

discussedallocations requests and
revealed their reasons for voting
to either grant or reject each re-
quest. ,

As part of the new procedure,
the allocations committee chair-
man read both his committee’s
recommendation and the reason-
ing behind it. The inclusion of the
committee’s reasoning is a signif-
icant step forward, and while it
should provide students with more
information about how decisions
are made about their money, it also
succeeded in sparking greater pub-
lic discussion by Board members

about their votes.

Such public discussion repre-
sents a remarkable shift in the al-
locations process, a process that
was previously carried out behind
closed doors. Moreover, this shift
in SGB procedure is a recognition
that students deserve to know how
decisions are being made about
the student money that SGB con-
trols. " ‘

Although Shull and his fellow
Board members should be congrat-
ulated for this new move towarda
more transparent student govern-
ment, it is necessary to recognize
that there is much more to be done
in increasing transparency within
SGB. For instance, meetings of the
allocations committee are still be-
ing held behind closed doors with-
out direct student participation.

Partially addressing the issue of
closed allocations meetings, Shull
said that he is working on posting

.minutes from theallocations com-
mittee meetings online, but this

still doesn’t address the need for

Rethinking skateboardings stance in society

With skateboarders’ unruly reputations, skateboarding provides the best way to heed the rebel calling

Keith Gillogly
Opinions Editor

   

Much of society does not like skate-
boarding. Take my aunt, for exam-

. ple. She recently asked me if I still

skateboard, and I told her I still do
when I have time. She answered,
“Oh. Ithought you would have given
up that bad habit by now.”

I’ll also never forget‘ the time
a friend and I were skating down
the sidewalks of New York when
we passed by a young girl and her

mother. Upon hearing the clack- ,

clack of our wheels, even though
we were a safe distance behind her,
the young girl emitted a shriek of
terror and quickly latched onto her
mother’s arm. On the verge of tears,
the girl turned to us wearing an ex-

_ pression of terror and loathing. I -

couldn’t help but mumble a sheep-
ish ‘Sorry’ while passing by, as her

. mother gave us an icy stare.

Today skateboarding is proliﬁc

in movies, video games and big-
name commercials for products
like Coca-Cola and Apple. But the
subversive stereotype persists that
skateboarders are a bad crowd.

While some skateboarders might
relish this image, there’s perhaps
an unnoticed beneﬁt provided by
that humble piece of wood with four
wheels. Then again, there’s legiti-
macy to all the disdain.

The skateboarder who says
skateboarding is not a crime is ly-
ing— well, almost lying. “No Skate-
boarding” signs are as ubiquitous as
parking meters. Property owners
don’t want to worry about a poten-
tial lawsuit fromfthejskateboarder
who sustains anginjury skating the
stair set, handraillpor whatever ele-
ment of the urban playground he
happens to launch himselfdown. In
some territories, it’s a crime.

If you didn’t know, most of those
knobs on ‘railings and slats affixed
to or cut into benches and ledges
_don’t serve any sort of ornamental
or structural purpose..They’re de-

signed to physically prohibit skate-
boarding. Bearing this restriction in
mind, skateboarders aren’t fault-
free. If you see any sort of ledge or
bench with an ugly black stain run-
ning along its edge, you can prob-
ably blame a skateboarder. That
marring results from applying wax
to get the ledge greased up enough
to permit grinds and slides with the
skateboard’s metal and wooden sur-
faces. Over time, the wax heats up in
the sun, gets ground in with heavy
use and leaves a stain more stub-
born than red wine on white carpet.
Those surfaces are also prone to
chip and disﬁgure after repeated
abuse from skateboards.

Despite all its scorn, skateboard-
ing provides an advantage to soci-
ety — and I don’t mean merely a
popular form of exercise or that it’s
become a $5 billion dollar industry
since 2005, according to CBS. Most
skateboarders take up skateboard-
ing for one simple reason — to have
ﬁm. Yet it also provides the perfect
outlet to heed the rebel running

. rampant in seemingly any teen-

ager’s blood.

It’s the unruly aspect of skate-
boarding that’s actually most valu-
able to the rest of society. Even
as skateboarding moves slightly
more into mainstream culture, its
characteristic renegade appeal is
ﬁrmly and crucially entrenched.
Sure there are those illicit incidents
when skateboarders ignore the “N o
Skateboarding” signs, but the crime
could be worse. What about graf-
ﬁti, larceny or any other deﬁant act
that mischief-seeking kids could
get into? Skateboarding might not
earn scholarships, but it can offer

i an alternative activity thatill satisfy

that inner rebel —— and no, you don’t
have to skateboard where it’s pro-
hibited to feel deﬁant, not that I’m
endorsing that activity either.

Still, some might say skateboard-
ing relates to, or leads to, more seri-
ous unruly doings. There’s bound to
be trouble hanging around with the
tough crowd, right? That could be
true in some instances, but anyone

- who’s ever stepped on a skateboard

comes to an immediate -realization
— it’s damn difﬁcult to learn. The
skateboarders who don’t give up in

‘ sheer frustration after a few weeks

realize it takes real commitment
to master. Once that drive sets in,
skateboarding becomes — on sur-
face level, at least — a construc-
tive form of exercise for the nascent
skateboarder. To some, it evolves
into a real passion, even a form
of art, whereas the skateboarder
is probably skateboarding more
for love of the sport rather than
an attempt to bolster bad-boy ap-
peal. Considering the effort it takes
just to become fairly competent at
skateboarding, all that time can’t be
wasted on real mischief.

Oh, and another plus -— skate-
boarding will also allow you to test
the limits of your body, namely, the
strength of yourbone structure. But
that’s a topic for another day.

greater student participation in the
decision—making process.

Don’t get me wrong, I commend
Shull for initiating these two im-
portant changes in the allocations
process, and I do believe that they
will make the process more trans-
parent. But students have both a
right to see how these decisions are
being made and a right to inﬂuence
these decisions themselves. ’

After all, SGB controls our
money, and students who are
neither Board members not lead-

ers of large student organizations
deserve the opportunity to affect
funding decisions. For this reason,
it is important for SGB to further
amend its rules to allow public
comment on allocations" requests
before ﬁnal votes are cast.

Such additional changes in SGB

even more transparent, but stu-

_ dents also have to play arole in

making SGB a more accountable

dents need to show up to weekly

discussion surrounding SGB.

It’s good to see a Board presi-

this perennial problem, and I look

steps — including the publishing
of allocations committee minutes
on the SGB website.

In the animal kingdom, cats are
known for their sassy yet nonchalant
demeanors. On stage, at least intheir
namesake musical, thefre known for
bombastic love ballads, heavy make-
up and spectacular dancing.

The award—winning musical
“Cats” sprouted from a small hit—or—
miss idea based on the poems in T.S.
Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practi-
cal Cats“. Its Broadway run lasted 15
years, and the musical has toured the
country for 26 years.

 

Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats” is
a surreal show. The plot is not clearly
deﬁned, though it basically follows
the misadventures of a group of stray
felines and ﬁlls the stage with com-
plex choreography taking place on a
set made to look like a junkyard.

This year’s cast includes Point
Park graduate Chris Mackenthun.
He plays the role of a magical, young

~ andfriskyblack—and—whitecatnamed

Mr. Mistoffelees. Though the behind-
the-scenes work put into the show
is grueling, Mackenthun described
“Cats” as a ﬁin production.

“It’s completely out of the box,”
Mackenthun said. “Nobody knew
what ‘Cats’ was going to be when it
came on the scene. They went with it
and said, ‘This is a magical show.”’ _

“Cats” also reaches audiences of
all ages as a family—friendly show -
it’s the show parents take their kids
to see because they saw it and loved
it, according to Mackenthun.

“There’s nothing risqué, there’s

nothing questionable,” he said. “I '

think people have just fallen in love

with the magic of the show because

it is so crazy.”

Audiences are almost required to
have the ability to go alongwith what
is on stage, otherwise risking the in-
ability to fully appreciate the show.

“Ithinkkids are more willingto go
with you on it— OK, you’reacat, I can
pretend that. And I also think adults
are also willingto suspend the belief,”
he said. “I guess if they aren’twilling,
then we haven’t done our j o .”

The rehearsal process combines
singing with stepping correctly and
following the choreography of the
show, which is one of the most con-
vincing aspects in a show being en-
tirely about cats.

“The show is designed and cho-
reographed and directed to make it,
‘What do you mean, you don’t think
I’m a cat?”’ he said.

“All movement shows you are a cat,
and you are better than the audience,”
he said. “It’s really magical when the
audience does suspend all belief, sits
back, and has a good time, because I
know we feel that [on stage] .”

“There’s this crazy set and quirky
movement that just facilitates the illu¥
sion just that much more,” he said. “I
think that most of the time the audi—i
ence is  to suspend belief and
say, ‘OK. This is a group of ca .”’

jM'ackentghu_.n graduated from
Point Park in2o05 with a degree in
ballet and a clear view of his career
goals. «
“I always knew I wanted to do
musicals and musical theater, and I
discovered I had a talent for dance,”

he said. “So Idecided I needed to give '

it any because I could always do mu-

sical theater, butl couldn’t always be a ‘

principal dancer at 70 years old.” .
Two years after.-graduating, he ac-

cidentally sturrjbleid into the role of a

 

magical black cat. He auditioned for
two shows in one day and obtained
a role in “Cats.” But it’s not an easy
job.

All tours of “Cats” travel with a
physical therapist to help take care

of the dancers and their bodies-

Injuries are common, according to
Mackenthun.
,“It’s live theater, sogyou never

-i know what’s going to happen,” he

sai .”

The basic challenges of — per-
forming properly aﬁertraveling,
stage setup, transitioning to the new
stage — are part of the job, althoug
_not always easy tasks. A

Mackenthun expressed enthu-
siasm to be returning to Pittsburgh
after ﬁve years.

“There’s so much theater in Pitts-

‘ burgh,” he said. “It’s just growing, and

I can’t wait to see what it’s growing
into. Everybody just loves going to
theater.” " '

Sam to Tavi: Quit treading on my turf, young one

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

My envious tendencies have reached
an all-time low. I’m j ealous of a 13-year-
old. 4

There’s atween lurking somewhere

around the Chicago suburbs who is
being invited to fashion shows left and
right. What gives, people? Whereare all
my Fashion Week invites?

Tavi Gevinson started her fashion
blog Style Rookie at the age of 11. She
posts pictures ofher quirky outﬁts and
sounds off on the season’s trends and

pop culture. Since then, she’s managed
to pick up all sorts of fame. Fashion
editors and designers are digging her
enough to give her a column in this
month’s issue of Bazaar.

Do you realizethe kind of rampant
insecuritya13—year—oldfashion colum-
nist triggers in a 22-year-old fashion

columnist? Let me tell you, it’s not
pretty. The girl is cute and all, but quite
ﬁankly she drives me crazy — mostly
becausewhenlwasthatage the closest
I was getting to the fashion industry
was shopping for Abercrombie jeans
at the King of Prussia Mall and feeling
really cool about it.

Sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy,
the designers behind Rodarte, hadTavi
create avideo of their recent collabora-
tion line for Target. Ibarely even know
how to turn a video camera on.

Reactions to Tavi’s exponentially
rising recognition are mixed. On the
one hand, we have all these designers

and magazines who are scramblingto getapiece
of her. On the other hand, there’s a whole lot of
scandal about whether she is actually writing all
these blog entries herself. Elle fashion director
Anne Slowey told New York Magazine that

“You look at her [Rodarce] video, and the writ-
ing doesn’t sync up with the way she talks about
fashion,” Slowey said. “WhenIwatched thatvideo
it smacked of this ethereal vagueness  I’m not
ttyingto take anything awayfrom her—herlove
of fashion, her love of style. She’s either a tween

Blogger an industry puzzle

savant or she’s got a Tavi team.”
Thanks for that, Slowey. It’s a relief to know

, that not everyone is so enthralled with this little

girl that I would have to give up my dreams of
working in fashion just because I’m already in
my 20s. ” -

Honestly, I don’t think the question, “Is this
all reallybeing done bya13-year—old?”is even the
point. It doesn’t make that much of a difference
to me whether this is her writing or her great-
grandmotheﬁs or her neighbor’s. Though forthe
record, I actually do think she’s the author. Who
the hell would give up the opportunity for that
level of popularity foratween? I’m not convinced
it would be her mother, either, because I don’t
think she would really be that into talking about
dying her daughter’s hairblue.

Don’t.you remember being 13? We all had a
near-obsessive wish for everyone to realize that
13-year—olds knew a lot more about life than ev-
erybody thought. Why is it that the secondiwe
get older, we automatically assume that anyone
younger is some kind of naive being, completely

incapable of understanding anything about the

world? _ ~

At the end of the day, Tavi does still sound
like she’s 13.,I don’t think the skill level is really
what’s admirable here 4- it’s the conﬁdence that
she’s actually willing to broadcast all this. I don’t
know aboutyou, butanythinglwrote whenlwas
in middle school is still locked away in a trunk
somewhere. Not to mention that I was terriﬁed
to wear anything nearly as daring as a leather
trench coat: like Tavi does.

Alot offolksareworried aboutthis chickbeing
exposedto the horrors ofthe fashion industry at
such an early age, but let’s face it people, there’s
nothing more horriﬁc than the halls of middle
school. Sitting in the ﬁ'ont row at Paris Couture
Fashion Week sounds like a walk in the park
compared to surviving teendom in the suburbs.

In actuality, I’ th_ink the fashion industry is the ‘

safest place for her. Theyarefar more likelyto be
acceptingofher creativitythancut—throat middle
schoolers looking forattention.

' In the past few years, the fashion blog world
has become a roaring presence. Bloggers have
become credible news outlets and sources of
inspiration. American Apparel regularly hires
personal style bloggers as models. Lucky Maga-
zine invites bloggers to be guest writers on their
website. It makes sense, really, that blogs have
become so reliable. The industry is based on
two things: creative personal preferences and
fast—paced revolutions. There is no better way
to keep up with the speed and quirks of fashion
thanwith blogs.

I can’t decide whether Tavi is atrend — inde-
pendentfashion blogs tendtohaveapretty short
shelflife — or if this tween is actually the next

AnnaW‘mtour. Surelythis mustbe what editors- .

in-chief were like at that age, no? IfTavi isnft ca-
pable of taking the Vogue throne, who is?

NowI know I’m not as endearingas ateenager,
butMarc]acobs, ifyou ever decideto make aline
forTarget (really, please do) and you need some-
one to make a video for you, I’d be happy to put
aside my homework and help you out. Call me!

cess at Pitt?

' “We have a standard and a level of
expectations thatwe abidebyandinstill
in our players. They need to expect to
winand know howtowin. Ifthe players
aren’t receptive to coaching or change,
that’s when you don’t show irnprove—
ment,” Dixon said. ‘

Dixon looks for players with
those qualities when recruiting.
“I1ike guysthatareusedtowinningand
who arewillingto make sacriﬁces, who
showthattheycareandthatwinningis
importantto them,” Dixon said. “There
are certain guys who somehow win
wherever they go. Why ﬁght that pat-

S tern, or ﬁght that history?.You’re bet-

ter otfbeingwith guys who are used to
winning and care andwho have 
up in winning programs.”

Dixon credited the University for
his ability to recruit so well, andhe
claimed this often gets overlooked and
understated. He stated thatplayerslil<e
Pitt — the city, the program and their
teammates.

Dixon’s strive for success has for-
mulated a common team phﬂosophy.
Players believe thereis always room for
improvement. .

“Everything is about improve-
ment,” he said. “I try to improve as a
coach every day, and in every job or
anythingieverdidmygoalwastoget
better: For our players, I hope that’s

their goal. We’re trying to help them
improve as students as well, and as
peopleto help them grow.” H

His visionforthe ﬁitaure ofthe pro-
gramwas evidentthis year, especiallyin
his ability to defy the rebuildingtalk.

“Some guys don’t play as much. At
the same time, you’re developingthem
foryears, and you need their improve-
ment even though you may not see it
in the games,” he said. “But that is a
bigpart inthe growth of our program
andhavingtheseguys readyintheyears
to come.”

In his time coaching at Pitt, Dixon

has coached ‘ﬁve Big East Most Irn- .

proved Players in Ricardo Greer, Bran-
din Knight, Carl Krauser, Aaron Grey
and Sam Young. Ashton Gibbs is inthe

. runningfor the award this year.

Dixon took great pride in the ac-
complishments of his former players.
“As acoachthereis no more important
orgratifyingawardbecausewe promise
our players and theirfarnilies when we
recruit them that We’re going to help
them improve as players and students
once they get here, and [the award] is
the best example I can give.”

With no returning starters in the
season’s opening game versus Wof-

noticeable. The team struggled early
againstnonconference opponents, ob-
 after several hard—fought
battles. .

’ “We don’t want to make excuses,”
Dixon said. “People were tellingushow

said. _

“[Gary] has worked hard and con-

some guys can become self-satisﬁed.
This is not the end of the road. It’s the

Talucci’s all—around skillslead Panthers "

The sophomore gymnast is off to a hot start, winning the all—around competition in two of Pitt’s first three meets this year

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

Dazzling, ferocious, powerﬁ1l—inad—
dition to conﬁdent, she’s feeling all of
these about her routines tonight.

She walks up to the mat, looking
down the barrel of the long stretch of

I paddinginfront ofher, waits, holds her

arrnshighintheair,thenfocuses on her
target. It’s a springboard sitting at the
end of the 82-foot-long mat serving as
the runway she’ll use to propel herself

on the vault.

Sophomore Alicia Talucci takes off

on‘ a dead sprint, arms slowly 

momentum, nearing the board with
eachstride, one last glimpse before she

. leaps, laimches, tucks, ﬂips, stretches

and sticks the landing.

The result, a score of 9.850, is the
best of the night.

She acknowledges the crowd, yet a
mere smirk creeps onto Talucci’s face
as she departs from her landing spot,
a tribute to her calm and focused de-
meanor. ‘ ‘

She’s humble off the mat, describing
herselfasa“ awful” snowboarder.
She’s even humble on the mat, pulling
off some dance moves while waitingfor

scoresaﬂ;erlastFriday’s meet. However, »

her status as only a sophomore could

earnherbraggingrights laterinher
career.

According to coach Debbie Yo-
hman, Talucci put together one of the
bestfreshman seasonsinPitt’s history.
Inthe all—around event, Talucci earned
All—East Atlantic Gymnastics League
ﬁrstteam honors and qualiﬁed for the

-NCAA Regional Championships. She
ﬁnishedthirdinall—around atthe EAGL
Championships with a 39.100 score.

All-around comprises four events
——thevault, unevenbars,balancebeam
andﬂoor exercise——withapossible 10
points each. The sum of all the scores
gives the gymnastanall—around score,
meaning Talucci was nearly perfect in

orderto score a39.100.

Yetthe littiemistakesarewhatdrive
hercrazy. _

“The [coaches] are pretty much
happy with what I do on the competi-
tion ﬂoor,” Talucci said. “Ifs more my-
selfthatgetsfrustratedbecauseIl<now
what mypotential is, and when I don’t
do it it’s really frustrating. I really hate
losing, and I’m really hard on myself
whenIdon’t do well.” '

“She’s differentto coach,” Yohman
said. “Ifshe’sstruggling, onceyou know
heryouleamtoleave heralone because
she’ll go and get her work done. We’ve
learned not to yell at her so much as
whenshewas afreshman nowthatwe

know. We leave her be, and she gets
it done.” '1

It’seasy, evenfora gymnastics nov-
ice, to notice her natural athleticism
and talents. However; what will push

Yohman said. i

“Ifshe stays healthy she’ll just get}
better and better,” Yohman said. “Shel
could be an all-around EAGL cham-
pion. She could be an EAGL champion
on beam. She could possibly qualify“
for nationals, but that’s also very hard
and tricky.” .

Coach thinks T alucci  
can advance to nationals

Talucci 4 9

Lillawalla Acosta I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Alicia Talucci’s one misstep against Ohio State was on the bars, her least favorite event.

The predictions could be endless, yet on the
mat they mean nothing. The fact is, the meet goes
on, and Talucci steps up for her second event of
the night — bars.

It doesn’t take Talucci long to name her least
favorite event. “Bars,” she says, without hesita-

‘ tion.

It’s stillfairly surprisingto see amistakebythe
Coatesville, Pa. native. A slight slipup costs her, and
the resultisa9.425 score. Strugglingonthe bars is
atheme of the night against Ohio State.

“I think we got a bit distracted during bars,
and that carried over to beam for us,” Yohman

Pitt’s perseverance he

thejunior Olympic nationals from 2005-07. She
ﬁnished fourth in the all-around competition in
the 2005_]unior Olympics.

Despite this good fortune, 2006, her high
school sophomore year, almost marked dev-

‘ astation for Talucci. She knew she was going to

compete at Division I somewherefor gymnastics
and had options to choose ﬁ‘om. -

A stress fracture in her right foot scared away
some teams and scholarship offers, Talucci said.
Out of her former options, which included Den-
ver, Iowa State and North Carolina, Pitt, more

speciﬁcally coach Yohman, remained the most
committed to her despite her injury.

“You go to nationals with all the college re-
cruiters there, and Pitt always supported me since
even my freshman year of high school,” Talucci
said. “Theywere pretty much the only schoolthat
keptin contactwith me. Theywerereallyupfront
with me and made sure howlwas doing [afrerthe
injury]. Other schools tried to pressure me to pick
themﬁrst, itwas really cutthroa ”

She rewards the Panthers day-in and day—out
with stellar performances in meets.

The temporary Panthertattoo still shimmers
on her cheek afterthe meet as she greets another
smilingfan. Despite Pitt’s (0-3, 0-1 EAGL) narrow
194.2oo—192.25o loss to Ohio State last Friday
night, Talucci was positive about the team and
her effort.

“I did pretty well. We just made a few little
mistakes — that’s all,” Talucci said.

Yohman, who set apreseason goal ofwinning
the EAGL conference for her team, thought dis-
tractions brought the Panthers down that night.

“We didn’tplaylikeEAGL champions tonight,

I thinkwe got  distracted during bars, and that
carried overtobeamforus,”Yohman said afterthe
meet. “We broughtitback on theﬂoorthough and
ﬁnished off strong. We hadagreat night on vault,
and we improved two points from last week.”
Talucci did win her second all-around title on
theyear, edging out Ohio State’s best by 0.075.
Infact, Talucci took ortiedforﬁrstinallofher

K events, exceptbars. That’s alottobehappyabout,

but there’s still that one mistake on the bars that
she’llthinkabout. _
‘Alicia got hurtalittle on bars, but everything
else tonightwas exceptional,” Yohman said. “She
is probably angry with her bars performance,
she made a mistake and didn’t take it with her on
beam,butthatis somethingthatisgreatabouther.
If she makes mistakes, she ﬁxes them.”
Yohman usedtheword“ferocious”todescribe
Talucci.
The term stuck because of Talucci’s attitude
and a testament from Yohman about her work
ethic. ' -
“Therewardthatyougetfrom doingadiﬂicult
sport, when you hit your routine — I wouldn’t
give that up for anything,” Talucci said, “A lot of
people don’t think it’s that hard and say, ‘Oh you
just dance around in a leotard.”’
ButTalucci describes gymnastics as “intense,”
which can also show in her aspirations.
“My goals are so much more higher than the
scoreboard,” Talucci said.
