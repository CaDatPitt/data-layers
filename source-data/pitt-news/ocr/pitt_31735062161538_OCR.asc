Jones-Banlzhead Bill
Called Ineffectual Aid

To Tenant Farmers

By ALICE BENOVITZ

The Mountain Boys comic strip
is very amusing with its poverty
and ignorance of the outside
world. “Tobacco Road” was
amusing .too.

There were some swell laughs
in it. But like so many humor-

ous situations, the basis is pa-

thetic fact. 'Unfortunately, there
are hundreds of tobacco roads in
the South, a great many worse
than the one. on the stage.

It is veryeasy to get emotional-
ly aroused over these conditions,
but it does far more good to try
and consider them dispassionately
and objectively.

Labor ‘Reservoir

To us in the North two aspects-—
economic and political-—have gen-
uine' signiﬁcance. Economically
the South furnishes an immense
potential reservoir of cheap labor.
Especially important to the man-
ufacturer in these days of labor
troubles is‘ the fact that these
people have long ago been beaten
into‘ docility.

The political point has already
been demonstrated. It was not
long ago that a self-styled prophet
arose from the deep South and
threatened to become a fascistic
leader. The South still remem-
bers Huey Long, and would prob-
ably follow him again if he were
alive. Germany and Italy have
proved that hungry, downtrodden
people gladly fall in line behind
the Pied Piper who promises the
world. -

The simplest reply to this in-
dictment is a complacent “What
about: the recently passed Jones-
Bankhead bill, which provides
for the loaning of $10,000,000 in
1938 alone?” Unfortunately, like
most bills passed in Congress, this
bill shows its flaws upon even a
cursory examination.

The ﬁrst flaw is that the bill

gives to those farmers already
possessing equipment. _ This is
tantamount to giving relief only
to those who have money in the
bank, and ignoring those who
have nothing.

Local" Autonomy

The second is that the bill sets
up a local committee to select the
farmers eligible for the loans. In
this way another eﬂicient politic-
al machine can be constructed.

As southerners emphasize time
after time, the sharecroppers’
problem, an institution built up
over decades, cannot be remedied
in a year or two. But certain cor-
rectives can and must be tried to
alleviate at least the worst abuses.

Financially, these correctives
include payment in money, in-
stead of the landlord’s script;
abolition of poll-tax, which dis-
qualiﬁes thousands of the pover-
ty-stricken from voting, and
makes swinging an election rela-
tively simple; legal interest rates,
instead of rates from 10 to 75 per
cent.

Financially, the government
should attempt to rescue the de-
pleted lands and organize collec-
tives under trained agricultural
supervisors.

Probably this last is to be the
salvation of the South, agricultur-
ally. The only time the South
will have salvation is when it
recognizes that all men, regard-
less of color or status have rights
which must be recognized. Even
the Constitution admits that.

Germani Demonstrates Electric
Organ’ s Potentialities I n Recital

By DENTON BEAL

After a long period of fruitless
argument, we have been given the
opportunity of judging for our-
selves the musical value of the
Hammond electric organ.

Fernand Germani, the ﬁrst in-
ternational artist to present the
electric organ as a major solo in-
strument, gave a brief program in
the Commons Room Monday even-
ing, and despite the brevity of the
performance showed very clearly
the scope of the instrument’s mu-
sical potentialities.

Most noteworthy features of the
electric organ seemed to be its re-
markable precision and rapidity in
passage work, its sheer power
(which, I believe, depends upon
the capacity of the loud-speaker),
and several brand new tonal pos-
sibilities.

The pedal work was faster than
that of a pipe-organ, but not quite
as clear. Missing, too, was that
awe—inspiring vibration of an or-
gan diapason.

The composition which showed
to best advantage was the brilliant
“Toccata” from Widor’s Fifth
Symphony, Which contained both
rapid contrapuntal work and pow-

A

‘er, as did also a “Gigue” by Cor-

elli.

I believe it is foolish to say that
the electric organ will supplant
either the pipe-organ or the or-
chestra, but I also believe that it
has opened up an entirely new
ﬁeld for composition, which should
rival in importance that of the
piano and pipe-organ.

Particularly was this noticeable
in Germani’s rendition of music
of the impressionistic school, and
in a peculiar kind of attack, which
might best be described as a forte-
piano, or a piano-subito carried to
its most exacting limits.

Dr. Tippetts Talks
At University Club

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of
the School of Business Adminis-
tration, will speak tomorrow eve-
ning at 6:30 o’clock at a dinner of
the alumni of Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology.

At the dinner, which will be
held in the University Club, Dr.
Tippetts will discuss the “Back-
ground of the Present Business
Depression.”

University Actor N arrat-es Sad
Experiences n French Depot

Bob King,'C_38, Pitt Players and Pittsburgh Playhouse actor,
calls his story “European Tragedy” or “The Difficulties of Not

Speaking French. ’ ’

King almost got lost in Europe last summer, all because he

couldn’t speak French. Or per-‘v‘

haps, because a train ticket—seller
couldn’t speak English.

It happened while Bob was
taking a subway train in Paris,
where he was stopping, before
proceeding to Germany for a six-
weeks course at the University of
Munich. He and a friend were at
the train station, __ preparing to
wedge their way into the train.

The automatic doors slid open
and the Americans moved along.
When Bob’s friend got into the
train, the doors closed, leaving
Bob on the outside looking in.
Down the road went the train,

while Bob desperately looked
about.
He went up to ”a conductor,

tried his sparse French, his vol-
uble English, and his careful
German. But the non-cosmopo-
lite Frenchman stolidly twirled
his moustaches, shrugged his
shoulders, and did not under-
stand. Neither did the ticket—sell-
er, nor the policeman.

;- After two hours, Bob by sign
language of a ticket to the next
station, lugged his baggage to the
sliding door. In the nick of time,
before Bob had made the move
that might have taken him to
some town in France, where peo-
ple knew neither English or Bob’s
French or German or sign lan-
guage, another train arrived, and
with it Bob’s anxious friend.

Bob was saved to come back
to America, enter the University
of Pittsburgh for his last college
year, act in the Pitt Players’
shows, and in the Pittsburgh Play-
house production of “Libel.”

Bob heard Adolf Hitler speak
several times while he was in
Munich. “He has a marvelous
voice,” Bob says, “but on the po-
litical situation—please, don’t
quote me.” However, he is glad
to be quoted on the beauties of
Bavaria and the German country-

land. “The most beautiful land,”
he says in his still voluble
English.

Pitt, Too

T has come to our attention that there ex-

ists a school of the University down on the

Bluﬂ, so close to Duquesne that it seems to be
part of the place.

This is the little-known Pharmacy School,
around which has grown fact and fancy much
like that clinging to the tale of old Rip Van
Winkle. Pharmacy students never come up
to the campus in Oakland, except possibly for

some one-year classes in Falk Clinic. To a
large extent fraternities ignore the Pharmacy

men as if they had the plague, and the group
has its own social fraternities.

The boys seldom go to University dances and
meetings or belong to clubs. You don’t' see them
in the student section at football and basket-
ball games, because they are not‘ given athletic
books. But they do pay the regular tuition
charges. 4

These Pharmacy students see about as much
of‘ Pitt as do those people who pass by the Ca-
thedral every morning on their way to work
downtown. Their position is such tliat a cry
for annexation to Duquesne while lending it-
self to humorous treatment also ends within
the bounds of crcdulity.

“We merely pose a very reasonable problem,
and must confess to not being entirely original
in our discovery. Nor do we feel that we
should demand that next week or next month
the Pharmacy School must be moved up to the
campus. \Vhcn and how this can be accom-

, plished we leave to other heads.

However, admission should be made by the

A Bill To Make
War Proﬁtable

 1 NATURAL accompaniment of the pres-

ent war hysteria is the industrial niob-

: ilization (Shephard—Hill) bill recently reported

out of the committee in the House.

' Ostensibly to “take the profits out of war,”
this bill provides for a universal draft in time
of war and a military dictatorship over in-
dustry, labor, and the press. Its provisions are
so drastic that some members of the House

5 committee have admitted that it will never be

passed in its present form.

Foremen and superintendents in the pro-
duction of war materials-—even the growing of

cotton comes in that category—-will auto-
matically become part‘ of the army. Labor will
work under set conditions, at set wages, and
violators will be ﬁned $100,000. (To all in-
tents and purposes, then, dissenters will be
jailed.)

The most sacred right of business to make
“reasonable profits” will be guaranteed; but
the very lifeblood of labor organizations, the
right to strike, will be denied.

It is no wondeiwthat! Representative Maury
Maverick said of this bill:

9 “It is a fake and a fraud and simply does
not do anything whatever to take the profits
out of war. All it does is give the chief exe-
cutive, dictatorial power.”

Nor is it strange that government control-—
which is so vehemently decried by businessmen
——will not be opposed by them in this bill, even
though it means a virtual nationalization of our
heavy iiiclustry. ’

For profits will be guaranteed and govern-
ment‘ is evidently more efficient, economical
and less bureaucratic in wartime than in time
of peace.

Well...

Letters

Editor, The Pitt News:

Mr. Gerald Ziskind, by implication in his recent
letter criticizing the validity of the information in
Bob Saﬁron’s column of February 25, places faith
in the news items of the United Press and Associ-
ated Press. At least Mr. Ziskind seems willing to
take the word of these syndicates that President
Roosevelt has endorsed the .Sheppard—Hill bill to
(Mr. Ziskind’s words) “destroy great proﬁts of
millionaires during time of war, a bill to eliminate
the traitorous actions of munitions makers.”

I assume that President Roosevelt knows what
the other signiﬁcant provisions of this bill are. I
assume that Mr. Ziskind does not, because if Mr.
Ziskind had read the bill in entirety, instead of
reading UP and AP descriptions of it, he would
probably have given greater credence and less emo-
tional criticism to Mr. Saffron’s column.

Elliott, Cuthbert Find
Art Styles Compatible

University‘ Pair Differ In Concepts Of Art,
Maintain Mutual Workshop-Apartment '
' By Estelle R’ Kovacs I 1

Much has been written about the clash in marriage between

Philli‘p’C.' Elliott, assistant professor of ﬁne arts at the Uni-
versity, seems to have found the proper ingredients for harmony
He says “Although Mrs. Elliott and I differ

each other mutually in our work,
and never quibble materially about
it.”

Mrs. Elliott, the former Virginia
Cuthbert, is an outstanding Pitts-
burgh artist in her own right. Mr.
Elliott is known to University stu-
"dents and faculty as the hard-
working, unobtrusive combination
of artist, teacher, and photogra-
pher.

JOINT STUDIO

About their mutual workshop on
Pennsylvania avenue, Mr. Elliott
says, “We have a 34 foot living
room, one—half of which is the
conventional sitting place, the
other half we use as a studio.”

Here both he and Mrs. Elliott
ply the trade that brought them
together a few years ago in Paris,
he studying there in connection
with his abstractionist work, she
on an Augusta Hazard fellowship
awarded her upon graduation from
Syracuse university. Mrs. Elliott
returned with her husband, and
has made Pittsburgh her home and
the potential scene for her paint-
ings ever since.

Chosen by the Bulletin Index as
one of the ten outstanding career
women in the city, Mrs. Elliott has
currently won second prize for her
painting “Ziggie’s Barber Shop,”
at the Associated Artists exhibit in
Carnegie Institute, where an ex-
clusive showing of her work will
appear sometime in April.

Mrs. Elliott is known, moreover,

Believes That History
Doesn’t Repeat Itself

By Dorothy Cleland

The man who ﬁrst said “His-
tory repeats itself,” was not ab-
solutely correct, according to Dr.
E. Douglas Branch, research pro-
fessor of history at the Historical
Society of Western Pennsylvania.

In commenting on the present
European situation in relation to
past history, Dr. Branch said,
“History moves in cycles, but the
terrain of the spirit over which
the revolving wheels repass is
never the same. No true parallel
can be drawn because the present
intense nationalism is a factor not
present when Imperial Rome was
going into its debacle.”

URGES ISOLATION

“The European situation is a
mess,” he continued, “but it has
its own distinctive and unpleasant
odor, an aroma not to be careless-
ly identiﬁed with any unsavory
smells of past history.”

Nationalism in Europe today is
even more intense than it was
prior to 1914, believes Dr. Branch.
Part of this feeling has its basis
in the “economic hatreds” of the
people. He said that the situation
is “rather like a battle royal at a
country fair. No one leader, no
matter how ﬁercely he growls,
can aﬁord to be wholly and con-
centratedly aggressive because
another dark gentleman will come
up behind him and clout him on
his own ear.”

The best policy for the United
States right now, he feels, can be
found in the writings of a French-

man. He said, “The last sentence
of Voltaire’s Candide, which is
‘Let us cultivate our gardens,’

seems a very sound precept just
now for this nation.”

WRITES HISTORY

“A child prodigy grows up” ex-
presses mildly the achievements
of Dr. Branch. At the age of
nineteen he had received a bach-
elor degree from the University
of Texas after only two years and
five months of work. By the time
he was twenty-two, he had a doc-
tor of philosophy degree from the
University of Iowa.

With four books dealing with
various phases of American his-
tory to his credit already, he is
now completing a history of travel
and transportation of Western
Pennsylvania, and a Volume on
colonial wars. At the same time
he is assisting in writing a dic-
tionary of American history, a
history encyclopedia to which Dr.
Alfred James, professor of history,
and Dr. John Oliver, head of his-
tory department, are contributing.

In addition to his work at the
University, Dr. Branch writes ar-
ticles for a few magazines, and is
assistant editor of the Frontier and

Midland magazine.

in some concepts of art, we assist%

to the University for her canvasses
that have recently been hung in
the Faculty club of the Cathedral.
Last year, moreover, she was in-
vited to exhibit at the Carnegie
International and at the Municipal
Art Show in Manhattan. ’

Unlike his wife, who prefers to
paint about the local scene, Mr.
Elliott’_s work covers a diversity of
artistic ﬁelds. "Hanging in the-As-
sociated Artists Exhibit is an ab-
stract ﬁgure study,—“a hang-over
from my trip to France,” as Mr.
Elliott phrases it. Also be ex-
hibits a still—life and a rich sombre
water-color, entitled, “Barns,”
painted last summer from a scene
about thirty miles outside of Pitts-
burgh, near Apollo, Pa.

PHOTOS EXHIBITED

Mr. Elliott, in addition to his
work as painter and teacher of art,
has made a study of photography.
A showing of his photos taken
while he was touring through Eu-
rope has recently closed at the
Gulf building. This same exhibit
will open again this Thursday in
the ﬁne arts department of the
university in conjunction with the
American Federal arts project.

Following his career as a pho-
tographer, Mr. Elliott successfully
ﬁlmed a moving-picture of Univer-
sity life, “Spring Class,” last sea-
son and is currently making plans
for the shooting of a second movie
to be written and acted by -stu-

dents of the University-

On History S tall" 1

By Shorty Long

“Good day, Dr. Shrimptassel.
Isn’t this a lovely afternoon? Yes?
No? Well, I think it is. Ah,
spring! Crocuses peer through the
underbrush, hyacinth bulbs beam
at one from windows, and . . . oh,
well, everything just lures one off
the beaten path. Ah, spring! Sniff,
sniff.

“By the way, Dr. Strapthistle,
have you ever made your way in
the cruel, cold world? VVhat do
you know of LIFE? Have you ever
crept out of your trundle bed in
the morning and washed your puss,
pardon me, I mean face, and hands
in a pitcher of frozen water? Have
you ever gone without your mid-
night snack? Have you ever been
a mother? No? Well, then, have
you read Thomas Wolfe? Sir, you
know simply nothing. Nothing
about LIFE!

“WORKING MY WAY”

Now, I am working my way
through college. I know all about
the world and its pitfalls. Oh,
such tribulations, you have no idea.
I wonder if you would be inter-
ested in subscribing to “Footpath
Thrills,” one of the finest maga-
zines of its ilk in the country.
You’re not interested! You don’t
give a ? Tsk. And you a
college professor! All the more
reason why you should read our
little publication. It will educate
you in the ﬁner, cultural things of
life.

Do you know that the chancellor
and all the deans have subscribed
to “Footpath Thrills!” And you
are the only member of your de-
partment who refuses to recognize
the value of it. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself. And it is
only $.52 a year! 0

Ah, that’s better. I know you
will never regret it. $.52 please.
Chirp chirp. Well, I must be oﬁ
now. Thank you very much Dr.
Beauwhistle, I knew you didn’t
wish to be the black sheep of the
history department!”

AND THEY BUY

There! That is a bit of a sample
of what the University faculty has
been undergoing. Perhaps you
might have gathered by this time
that an enterprising magazine
salesman has been exerting his
prowess to favorable extent among
unsupecting pedagogues.

He tripped from one office to an-
other, telling each professor that
another had sent him. He praised
their football prowess, remembered
when they hit home runs for good
old Pottsville U., and . . . got sub-
scriptions. (They had to get rid
of him somehow!) I

And now I’d better quit. I saw!
a movie wherein a little boy bit a

reporter. Frankly, I should hate to,

have a magazine salesman bite me.
Rattlesnakes are pests, too!

College Hockey Slides
Merrily On Its Way

Leonard Levison

Hockey ’s sudden jump into the posi-tion of one of the big

things on campus creates no collegiate precedent.

To be ac-

--currate, it only follows the times._ Eddie French, who has been
‘blowing a whistle in University ice circles for the past seven
years, after giving up amateur play in Toronto, should" be as

-capable an oracle on the subject as¢

it is possible to ﬁnd.
' 42 16 =1

.Long- Termers

“‘Col1ege hockey in the United
‘States has improved 50 per cent in
‘the past few years. I wouldn’t be
-surprised to see several American

‘collegians click in the National
League before 1940,” said Mr.
‘French.

“Better coaching, more prep
school teams and keener interest
-all along the line have combined
‘to put American college teams on
a near par with the Canadians.
"Goal tending in particular has
‘taken great strides. Where a few
‘years back most of the U. S. col-
legians fumbled their way around

the ice, they now give a smart,
creditable display of all-around
workmanship.”
With regard to American cam-
pus teams matching the Canadians,
there seems to be the little matter
of a slight divergence in the eligi-
bility rules for the two countries.
According to Holcombe York,
-coach at Yale, they will have to be
drawn closer with standardized
“regulations then under the existing
conditions. I
“Some of the Canadian univer-
sities permit their students to play
‘hockey while taking post—graduate
courses. It’s not unusual to see a
Canadian remain on a college team
for nine years. Naturally, such a
player should become fairly pro-
ﬁcient through sheer experience.”

Few Big Leaguers

As for French’s supposition that
in a few years the cloistered
hockeyers will be in the big time,
only time can take care of seeing
this belief borne out. At present
the percentage of graduates into
the fastest competition is meager.
In fact there have only been sev-

eral collegians graduating into the
National League. Only three come
to mind. Those being George
Owens of Harvard, Myles Lane
from Dartmouth, and Michigan’s
Johnny Sherf, who played with

Detroit last season.

Early Practice

On the subject of spring football
practice, those who point the ﬁn-
ger at this section of the country
might take an observation of what
is going on on the Paciﬁc Coast.
Amos Alonzo Stagg, referred to as
the “grand old man of football”
and he is one of the ﬁnest charac-
ters in athletics, called his gridders
out last week. It is reported that
he is getting them ready for his
own “homecoming” day when he
brings his team to play the Uni-
versity of Chicago in the Windy
City on November 12. At least,
they will be prepared.

Rose Bowl Effect

Out at the University of Califor-
nia they have a system, known as
Associated Students, whose func-
tion it is to run the campus ac-
tivities. In his mid—year report
the comptroller stated that the or-
ganization has shown a proﬁt of
$212,698.71 so far. This appears to
be a rather substantial argument
toward the production of good
football teams.

=14 * *

One thing we would like to see ,

happen, and won’t, is a dual swim--
ming meet between Pitt and
Princeton, both undefeated. It
would be worth anything to watch
Al Beacon backstroke against
Princeton’s Captain A1 Vande
Weghe. It is believed that the
Princetonian is about the only col-
legian who could beat Pitt’s soph-
omore.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

Western Reserve To Challenge

HE “Mighty Little Men” are poised in the above picture. From

left to right they are Taylor Brittain, Dick Friday and Captain
Bob Schooley, whose combined three sticks are equivalent to
sticks of dynamite when it comes to leading Pitt’s offense, which
they will do against Western Reserve in the Garden tonight.

Pitt Cagers Recapture
Floor Form, City Title

Champions, the Jungle Cats of
Pitt invade the Lion hideout up
at College, Pa., Saturday night,
for an Eastern Conference bas-
ketball game with Penn State.

The outcome of this game will
have no effect whatsoever on
the Eastern leaders, the Temple
Owls, who are in indisputable pos-
session of the Conference crown.
This tilt will be only a part factor
in determining
th e runner-up
and third posi-

tion 0 f t h e
league.
In the Pitt-

Penn State
skirmish earlier
this year on the
Stadium hard-
wood, a sharper
looking Nittany
quint, fatigued
from a strenu-
ous road trip,
bowed to the
so-so Panthers. The return meet-
ing should ﬁnd Johnny Lawther’s
boys set to even up the season’s
series.

Last Sabbath the Carnegie Tech
shooters had an unfavorable ses-
sion with their revivified city ri-
vals, and were helpless against the
new found basket eye of Eddie
Spotovich and Captain Bob John-
s o n . T h e rough-and-tumble
Panthers escaped with the City
Championship, blasting the Plaid
into the bottom berth, 36 to 30.

Coach Carlson’s Panthers, as was
not the habit this season, played
heads-up ball and close guarded
the Techs to make the thin clad
Plaidmen earn their every tally.
Also the Tartan shooting was pa-
thetic. The Blue and Gold ﬁve
navigated the sphere for tallies in
magniﬁcent style. This was un-
questionably one of the best Pitt
performances of the year. The
senior Cathedralmen copped the
local honors in a more than satis-
factory manner.

The Panthers retain the City
cup by virtue of their clean-sweep
of the Skibos and split series with
Duquesne courtmen. Coach Davies’
Dukes are in the number two spot,
with one win over both Pitt and

Lose, Verdicts

Go Wrong Way

Putting on one of their best
shows of the current season, and
sporting the best team in Pitt’s
boxing history, the highly touted
Panther mitt team went down to
a disappointing, but questionable
defeat, last Saturday afternoon
when they tackled an underrated
State aggregation.

Losing decisions which could
have been, and should have been
recorded in the victory ledger for
the Pitt boys, the Shrickerite
coached contingent found itself on
the bottom of a 5 to 3 count.

Ralph Dorand, the 1ocal’s east-
ern conference champ lost a close
bout to his Lion foe. Dorand sent
his opponent to the canvas in the
second round, but was outslugged
in the third stanza.

Johnnie Wargo, 125, extended
his win streak to ﬁve consecutive
victories with his decision over
Tapman. Had the bout gone an-
other, Johnnie would have reg-
ister his fourth knockout.

Displaying the form which saw
him bowling over his early sea-
son opponents, Captain Ralph Ca-
ruso ended up a loser. The Panth-
er Captain did everything but hit
opponent with the water bucket,
but his impressive show didn’t
seem to appeal to the referee.

Jed Curzi was a victim of cir-
cumstances when the winning
nod was given to his opponent.
When a man is down for a count
in the second round, and out on
his feet at the end of the ﬁght, it
is hardly likely that he should be
given the decision for a gallant
stand against a superior foe.

The versatile Bombe who up to
date has boxed in the 165 and 155
weights, swung out a decision in
the former class.

Coach Shricker was pleased
with the impressive showing of
the freshman glovers. The year-
lings ringers would have won had
they not had to forfeit the 165
and 155 divisions.

Group Of IC4A Chonnps Wili Attend
Meet Minus Any Title Aspirations

A ﬁeld of 500 crack trackmen‘

vv

will make New York ’s IC4A In.-
door track meet next Saturday
the topnotch track carnival of
the season. This is one meet
where the individual perform-
ance is subordinated, and team
performance becomes all impor-
tant.

An unheralded trackman, quiet-
ly slips across the line in ﬁfth
place, wins the meet by 1/10 of a
point; and everybody is happy.
(Of course if he slips across the
ﬁnish line ﬁrst, and wins the meet
by ten points, everybody is still
happy.”) Every fraction of a point
counts, and thirds, fourths, and
ﬁfths achieve peramount consid-
eration. ,

Coach Olson will take a squad
to the bigtown and toss them into
the activities. Already holder of
the outdoor Intercollegiate Amer-
ican Amateur Athletic Associa-
tion title, termed IC4A for the
sake of brevity and the printers,

Pitt stands little chance of adding
the Indoor crown to their records.
The mile relay team, Frank Ohl,
Al McKee, Al Ferrara, and John-
ny Woodruff, will make its third
start of the season.

WOODRUFF OUT

Twice before they broke the
wire second, and with a spurt
here and there the Panther baton-
welders may sweep in home lead-
ing the pack. But—-and there
are two or three buts—-Manhat-
tan, N. Y. U., and Fordham all
have cyclonic relay teams and
the Pitt boys will have to do some
mighty fast running to win.

Johnny Woodruff will not go to
the post in the 600 meter run. In
his only race of the season, dur-
ing the Millrose games, Johnny
chased the pack home, and since
then he has been concentrating on
rounding into shape before trying
to run the middle distance again.

On March 12, Johnny will stride

the half mile in the Central Inter-
collegiates at South Bend, and re-
prove his status as the country’s
premier half—miler.

Captain Dick Mason, Ed
Routch, and John Bazyk will com-
plete the Manhattan bound squad.
Mason, with Frank Ohl will rep-
resent Pitt in the 60-yard dash.
The versatile Ohl is also slated
to help Ed Routch win points in
the broad jump. John Bazyk will
buck a couple of world-record
holders in the shot-put.

Ken Ryden, hurdler, will miss
this meet and all the rest of the
indoor meets. Ken pulled a muscle
in his leg and will be conﬁned to
the sidelines until the robin chirps
tweet, tweet in the outdoor sea-
son. Ryden joins Pete Bennett on
the temporary sick lists, and leads
Olson to mutter that everything
happens to Olson. (Note: Olson
as yet has not pulled a muscle in
his legs.)

Pitt’s Hockey Lead Tonight  

Panthers Matched
With Clevelanders

For First Time

Tonight in Duquesne Garden
Pitt makes a ‘target of its six
game winning streak for VVest—
ern Reserve to snipe away at,

and at the same time, Pitt’s
standing in the Eastern Divi-
sion of the O-P Intercollegiate
Hockey League, goes on the block.

John McSorley, hockey coach,
says that his team has a plenty
tough time ahead. For, besides the
game tonight, Western Reserve
plays the Panthers in a Cleveland
return match tomorrow.

NOT UP TO PAR

At the present writing Western
Reserve is pressing John Carroll
for the Western division lead,
having lost only two games. John
Carroll tripped them early in the
season and the Dukes dropped
them in an upset-overtime aﬁair
last week.

On top of the fact that the Blue
and Gold icers came out on the
short end of the schedule, their
game has not been up to par in
the last two starts.

Baldwin-Wallace and Penn
State, the latter in an exhibition
tile, fell before the Pitt icers, but
made the Panthers look bad, any-
way.

NO LINE-UP CHANGES

Mcsorley gave the boys a short
layoff after the State ﬁasco last
Tuesday and in practice at the end
of the week a decided improve-
ment was seen in the squad’s play-
ing.

No changes have been made in
the starting lineup of Ellis in the
nets; Lovett and Broida, defense;
Schooley and Friday, wings; and
Brittain, center.

But the alternate line has suf-
fered severe set-backs in the
losses of Irv Artz, Paul Kennedy,
and Bob Burke. The three main-
stays of McSorley’s shock troops
have been lopped off of the squad
because of poor marks.

STUDENT BOOKS GOOD

If the “umph” displayed in
week-end practice sessions is car-
ried over to the games tonight
and tomorrow, Pitt will stand a
good chance of overcoming its
weakened condition and improv-
ing its position against the Dukes
for divisional honors.

Win, lose or draw, Pitt usually
puts on a grand show and against
opposition of the ﬁrst class it is
at its best. The game starts at 8
o’clock, following the Tech-Duke
opener. Tickets will be on sale at
the Garden with the admission
twenty-ﬁve cents with a student
book, ﬁfty cents general admis-
sion.

Creeks Resume Basketball Play
With Three Contests Tonight

Kappa Sigma, current champ¢
of interfraternity basketball is
favored to win its fourth
straight basketball game to-
night when it opposes the Phi
Delt‘s.

However, Johnny Micheloson,
ace scorer of the champs may
not be able to play. Providing
“sure Shot” Mike doesn’t play,
the Phi Delts stand a very good
chance of upsetting the Kappa
Sigs apple cart.

At 8 o'clock the Theta Chi
dreadnaughts will play the cellar
holding Sigma Chi’s. Daddio,
Chickerneo, Peace, and company
should have little diﬂiculty win-
ning their second game of the
present season.

Nine o’clock ﬁnds Sigma Alpha
Mu and Pi Lambda Phi squaring
off at Tree Gym. Each team has
won one, but the Sammies drop-
ped two decisions, while the Pil-
ams have been scalped but once.

Tomorrow night’s game between
the Kappa Sigs and the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon’s will more than

likely determine the winner of
League B. Each team has played
and won three games. The champs

Expert Describes

Plans For Flood
Control At Forum

BY ROBERT ADAMS

If the ten dams planned for
ﬂood control in the Pittsburgh
-district had been in existence
before the record ﬂood of
March, 1936, large amounts of
property damage would have
been averted, Major R. M. Mc-
Cutcheon, assistant district U.
S. engineer, told students at In-
quiry Forum Monday.

Speaking in place of Lieutenant-
Colonel W. E. R. Covell, district
engineer, who had been called to
Harrisburg on oﬁicial business,
Major McCutcheon described the
ﬂood control problem and the
plans which have been prepared
by Army engineers for use in the
Allegheny-Monongahela w a t e r -
shed.

FLOOD PREVENTABLE

“When the level rises to some
critical point, it is the last few
feet of’ water which cause the
most damage,” explained Major
McCutcheon. “In the St. Pat-
rick’s day ﬂood, it was the last
foot of water which put the elec-
tric utilities plant out of commis-
sion.”

Crest of the 46-foot St. Patrick’s
day ﬂood would have been reduced
by eight feet if the entire system
of ﬂood control dams now planned
had been in operation, and the
level would have been reduced al-
most two feet with only the re-
cently-completed Tygart river dam
functioning, claimed Major Mc-
Cutcheon.

“A reduction of eight feet, you
might think, would not amount to
much, but it would have saved a
tremendous amount of money.
From information we have col-
lected to determine at what stage
the ﬂood damage occurred, a con-
servative estimate showed that the
Tygart dam alone would have
saved 17 million dollars in Pitts-
burgh,” he said.

WALL NOT FEASIBLE

Possibilities of protecting Pitts-
burgh’s “Golden Triangle” by a
ﬂood wall are not favorable, the
speaker related, because it would
be impossible to build a wall high
enough and strong enough to pro-
tect entirely the lower sections of
the city.

“The ideal way to protect Pitts- ;
burgh would be to build large
dams above the city on the Alle-
gheny and Monongahela rivers.

“But the prohibitive damages
which would have to be paid to
people living in communities
which would be ﬂooded make this‘
type of dam impossible.”

Designs Made

For Nationality
Room Walls

Decoration of the walls of the
Italian, Hungarian, and German
rooms in the Cathedral was com-
pleted recently. ,

Planned by Denes Gyargyi, who
recently designed the Hungarian
Government building at the In-

ternational Exposition in Brussels,
the Hungarian room has walls
covered with a ﬁnely grained
white oak veneer, decorated with
carved and painted escutcheons of
the various Hungarian universi-
ties.

On one wall will hang a tapes-
try representing Hungary’s cultu-
ral contribution to the world in
the personality of King Mathias,
who brought the arts of the Ren-
aissance to Hungary.

Walls of the Italian room are
panelled in walnut part of the
way up, and parchment-colored
plaster will cover the rest of the
walls.

Against the plaster, above the
panelling, will hang a painting of
Helena Cornaro Piscopia, the ﬁrst
woman to receive a doctor’s de-
gree from a university.

Completion of the walls of the
Scottish room will ‘follow the ‘cor-
nerstone laying. Work on the
walls of the Chinese, Greek, and
Swedish rooms is scheduled to be-
gin soon.

Business Index
Goes To New
Low In Slump

According to the University’s
Bureau of Business Research, a
substantial decrease in industrial
production and a moderately large
decline in originating freight
shipments were responsible for a
further drop in the level of busi-
ness in the Pittsburgh district last
week.

Business in the district has de-
clined for three consecutive
weeks, the index last week reach-
ing a new low level in the current
recession. The adjusted index of
business last week stood at 68
per cent of the 1923-25 average;
it was 69.8 in the preceding week
and 12.3 in the week ended Feb-
ruary 20, 1937.

The volume of trade advanced
a little last week, owing chieﬂy to
a pronounced gain in department
store sales. Yet, combined busi-
ness in the ﬁrst seven weeks of
1938, was only about 4 per cent
below that in the comparable
weeks a year earlier.

Industry, including steel mill
operations, electric power produc-
tion, and bituminous coal produc-
tion also fell off a little, the Bu-
reau announced.

Pitt Players
To Present

Melodrama

To Audition For .
Radio Series

On KDKA Soon

Two possible events for Pitt
Players were announced today
by Oscar Goodstein, C38, presi-
dent of the dramatic group.

This afternoon a group of the
Players will present an old-time
melodrama before the audition
board of station KDKA. The ra-
dio station has expressed an in-
terest in including the Players in
a series of local programs they
are planning to start next month.

Within the next several weeks
Goodstein expects to announce
details for “really the most novel
affairs staged on the campus.” The
event, according to the Players
head, will be held in collabora-
tion with another campus organi-
zation.

The melodrama to be presented
this afternoon before the KDKA
group is “The Two Orphans,” a
play popular in the 1890’s. Buell
Whitehill, assistant director of
Pitt Players, has been in charge
of preparation of the sketch. Mr.
Whitehill directed the show, as
one of a series of melodramas
presented over a Hartford radio
station.

Working in the sketch today
are: Goodstein, Eleanor Haught,
C39; Edna Kauifman, BA40; Bern-
ard Mayer, BA39; Patricia Elmer,
C40; Bob King, C38; William
Dowling, C41; Earl Riley, C39;
Helen Akerman, C38; Betty

Good Lawyers

Although there is some discrim-
ination against women lawyers,
able women succeed in law as
readily as the men, according to
Judson A. Crane, professor of law.

Mr. Crane is the author of Crane
on Partnership. This recently
published book is designed to pre-
sent a picture of the partnership
form of association, together with
variations V such as the limited
partnership.

Since the passage of the W0-
men’s suffrage amendment, Mr.
Crane declares, women lawyers
have been placed in certain gov-
ernmental positions for which
they are aswell ﬁtted as men. As
the women are proving their abil-
ities, prejudice, against them is
gradually disappearing.

Outstanding graduates of the
University School of Law are
Judge Sara Soﬁel of the County
Court, and Miss Anne X. Alpern,
First Assistant City Solicitor. The
11 women now enrolled in the law
school are Mary T. Dilworth, Ag-

Saturday Dance

All is not quiet along the sur-

If you are a med student, and

like to know that you will ﬁnd
your chums at the Fort Pitt Ho-

Leroy’s orchestra—that is, if you
don’t forget the two dollars you

Accident To Students

Just as we are going to press
comes word of a disaster to three
of our Pittites.

You will be sorry to hear that
Louise Baughman, Lucille Upte-
graft, and Grace Augenstene are in.
the Pittsburgh Hospital as a result
of an automobile accident which
occurred Monday as they were
driving home. Louise has been
seriously injured, while Lucille
and Grace escaped with minor in-
juries.

May we extend our sympathies,
and hope that all three will recov-
er from their shake-up soon and
return to the campus, where they
are certainly missed.

Italian Club

Throws “Open House”

Tomorrow night may be a
regular social meeting on their
calendar, but it sounds like lots
more when the members of the
Italian Club throw an “Open
House” party in the “Y” Club
rooms at the corner of Forbes
and Bouquet. Everyone is in-
vited!

Not only are they planning to
dance and play cards and ping
pong, but they even promise re-
freshments. What! No spa-
ghetti? Of course, we don’t’
know, but you might drop in to
ﬁnd out. Anyway, we forgot to
tell you that the fun begins at
eight.

In Which We Make

A Private Appeal

This story gives us an idea! It’s
about the public speaking unit
which dined last Monday night at
Heinz House. Guests. of honor
were Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant
dean of women; Miss Genevieve
Blatt, women’s debate coach; and
Lucille Uptegraﬂ’, new chairman of
the freshman council.

But to get back to the idea—it
is directed to the freshmenonly.
Why don’t you unit chairmen hint
around to your publicity chair-
man that you would like a little
more notice in the columns of your
campus newspaper, especially
about your unit’s social affairs?
Then tell them that they can ﬁnd
us in the News oﬁice (usually)
every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, and we shall welcome them

with open arms. That ought to
ﬁll the column-—and put a few

more gray hairs on our head.

Mr. Carley Announces
Names Of New Greeks

Don’t let this confuse you, but
here are the names of some new
pledges—not last week’s rushees.

Mr. Robert Corley, assistant
dean of men, reports the following
list of men with the fraternities
they joined recently: Stan
Mathews, Lambda Chi Alpha;
Louis Mendlow and Eugene Feld-
man, Sigma Alpha Mu; William
Hawkins, Sigma Chi; James Weber
and Harris Hawkins, Delta Tau
Delta; Robert Conrad, Kappa Sig-
ma; and Darwin Gillespie, Sigma

Some Students

Come To Study

It must be admitted that a great
many students in the University
take courses for the time or ef-
fort element—the less of each, the
better. However there are a num-
ber of very specialized courses
given for small groups of students
whose only concern is the value of
the course.

Mr. Santens, head of the taxi-
dermy department of Carnegie
Museum, has been giving a course
in taxidermy to University stu-
dents for the last nine years. Due
to Mr. Santen’s illness, the course
has been dropped this year.
