Institute Fellows
.Publish Booklet
On Air Pollution

In response to a request by the Gell-
eral Science Club of teachers ill the
Pittsburgh high schools, two Mellon
Institute investigators, H. B. lVIeller,
head of the air pollution investiga-
tion, and L. B. Sisson, industrial fel-
low in smoke abatement, have pre-
pared a booklet, “The Municipal
Smoke Problem.”

The booklet, just off the presses,
was designed to provide secondary
school students with a general and
basic knowledge of fuels ill a compact
form.

The text is prepared so that it may

be used in its present form or may be
divided so that part of it may be
used in a physics course while the re-
mainder may be used in chemistry.
Principals, heads of science depart-
ments, _or otherinterested persons
may secure copies of the text and
other information on air pollution by
writing to the Air Pollution Investi-
gation in care of the Mellon Institute.

For F lexible, Coal Regulation

By Chester Harris‘

A detailed discussion of the bitu-
minous coal study recently prepared
by the Bureau of Business Research
is beingfeatured daily by the Pitts-'
burgh Post-Gazette. -

Supplementing these discussions
there will be a summary at the end. of
the week which is expected to bring
out the high points of the study. Fol-
lowing this summary, the entire study

is expected to appear next week ill »

book form. The study, prepared joint-
ly by _Wi1bur G. Fritz alld Theodore A.
Veenstra of the Bureau staff, includes
a survey of both production and dis-
tribution of the bituminous coal in-
(lustryin the United States, with spe-
cial reference to the present instabil-
ity of--the‘ industry. This survey -is
followed by a consideration ofvarious
proposals that have been advanced for
remedying the ills of the coal indus-
try. Finally, the essentials of. a na-
tional policy are enumerated. ,

-and water power.

Among these, over-capacity and unre-

stricted expansion, basic causes of
ills in the industry, have no remedies
provided. With regard to labor con-
ditions, it is shown that the act en-
courages collective bargaining by
mine operators with their respective
employes but that the extent to which
wage differentials among the va.rious
districts are reduced depends largely
on the attitude and strength of the
national union.

With reference to the regulation of
the industry, the authors point out
that no regulations governing the bitu-
minous coal industry can have much
effect unless thecompeting sources
of energy also are regulated. These
competing sources of energy are an-
thracite coal, petroleum, natural gas,
More than this,
the authors state that regulation of

the bituminous industry must be ﬂexi- ,

ble so that adjustment may be made
to the conditions «of industry in gen-
eral from time to time. . ,

Editorial Board   ,
Extends Deadline
For Journeymai~z

The editorial board of the Journey-
man, University literary publication,
decided. at a meeting last week to
postpone the date of publication of
the-fall. issue to about January 20, ex-
tending the deadline for material to
Monday, January 6, the ﬁrst day of
school after the Christmas holiday.

Reasons for delaying publicatioll
were that there was not a large
enough variety among the manu-
scripts submitted, alld that reports of
inquiries from interested students in-
dicated that they had not had enough
time to prepare or polish their work.

According to George McGifﬁn, C36,
editor: “Interest in the Journeyman
is growing, but does not seem yet to
have extended far enough into the
general student body. We prefer the
conception of the magazine to be
serious and signiﬁcant, rather than
literary. Not only artistic work:
poetry, stories, criticism; but all man

her of student. writing, reflective or '

enjoyable, so long as it has its own
stylistic excellence; should be repre-
sented.’’

Franklin Discuss
Religious‘ ‘A Faith

“Does College Weaken or Strength-
en Religious Faith?” was the question
discussed by Dr.‘ S. P. Franklin, pro-
fessorof religion and religious educa-
tion, at the Monday Freshman Club.‘

“The answer is yes and no,” said
Dr. Franklin and then he went on -to
explain that various persons are
affected ill different ways. He ad-
mitted that there is a great gap be
tween religion and education and
added that it is felt more distinctly
ill the university level than in any
other. _

Dr. Franklin stated that there is no
speciﬁc deﬁnition for religion, and
compared it to psychology and the
social sciences in this respect.

“Religion as experience is a real-

ity,” -he. aﬂirmed, and urged--that-'-ire-.

ligious experience be maintained in
the midst of conﬂictillg situations.
-The speaker revealed the interest-
ing fact that there are 45 different re-
ligious sects represented in the Uni-
versity. He said that there are two
t.hings that are true about the situa-
tion. ‘The ﬁrst is that in a university
students are forced to think about re-
ligion, and second, that most of these
students, have-: already had some sort
of religious experience previous to
coming to the University.

He urged, as the best plan, a bal-
ance between the spiritual and the in-
tellectual.

Solemn Tribunal 
Scared Freshmen To Trial

“You al'e hereby subpoenaed to ap-
pear before this court!” . . . “Herein
fail not, at your peril!” '

These words summoned freshmen

to appear Friday at 1 o’clock before
the Judicial Tribunal in the banquet
room of Memorial Hall. Subpoenas
bearing these (to some‘ frightening
messages were distributed at orienta-
tion classes and through the mails
yesterday, in preparation for the
plaque-awarding ritual Friday.

Ja.ck Scott, C39, transfer from Duke
University, was, in his own words,
“scared to death.” Said Scott: “The
last time I got one of these things, I
was caught crashing the gate of the
Duke-Alabama game. We got licked,
too.”

Members of the faculty, too, were
puzzled, when frantic freshmen asked
their opinion. Charles‘ Herald, C36,
chief justice, reassured them, and
stated: “No"ﬁnes or sentences will
be imposed at this rneetillggof the

’     Another View

,_ ‘ OVERNOR GEORGE H. EARLE made a ﬁne
 speech to the Intercollegiate Newspaper As-
sociation delegates Friday. As was expected,
the college journalists were very much pleased
with the Governor’s talk. Also as was expected,
. thedowntown newspapers hit upon one small part
of‘ the Governor’s remarks and played that part
to t_he hilt in reporting the event.
 ; It_was not unwarranted for the speaker to tell
,'the*undergraduate editors that theirs is a respon-
.»sible» job and that they should be quick to crack
down on things about their respective universi-
eties which are not quite up to snuff. Most of the
-‘editors like to hear that, and no speaker can go far
'wrong in advancing such an opinion. It is some-
_thing ‘like telling a ten-year-old boy with a big
piece of candy in his hand, “Go ahead and eat it;
it’s good for you.”

There may be those who doubt that the candy
will be particularly good for the boy, or the un-
bridled power of the printed page good for the
more or less immature editors. While it is a ﬁne

-éth-ing for a college boy to know that he can go
‘the limit in whatever he wishes to say, still there
can be built up a rather strong case for those who
'maintainW"’that‘a7 little_ guidance here and there
"will do muclrmore good in preventing mistakes
than it will do harm in suppressing notice of a rare
signiﬁcant grievance. ‘

If it were true that administrative officers and

faculty sponsors of campus newspapers were hard-
ﬁsted villains in fear of whom the boys and girls
behind the typewriters lived in mortal dread, then
theremight be some reason for beating up the war-
drums for a reckoning. But those higher up are
,seldom of a dictatorial type; they are only too
willing to discuss problems and present sane views
-. of possible consequences.
A college editor’s year in the saddle is but a
brief speck upon the history of a college or uni-
versity. It got along well enough before he came;
it will manage to exist when he passes. That his
one opinion of an administrative abuse should

send him into bitter tirades against an institution _

which he himself has selected above all others as
an alma mater, does not seem to strike a proper
note.

_It. is pleasant to hear that as a college editor
you‘ should be free to let loose a barrage upon any
conditions at all which disturb you. It might be
more pleasant to realize that there are other heads
which are better when the urge comes to do some

cracking.
A with at the recent convention was the pro-

posed boycott of the Olympic games to be
held in Berlin next summer. A somewhat jumbled
vote showed a 16-14 count in favor of the boycott,
indicating the sentiment of the group as it stood in
the ﬁrst,-;n1eeting of the delegates.

' A committee on Fair Play in" Sports in New
York is sending out tons of literature and creating
a lot of publicity in general for the same purpose.
Roger Chase, editor of the Columbia Spectator, is
heading the drive.

Evidently there is quite a feeling among college
‘students to the eifect that the boycott of an age-
old series of athletic contests will help to make
the world free of race prejudice, or at least go a
long step forward in that direction. Despite the
fact that information coming from Germany
proves conclusively that the games themselves will
have no taint whatever of anti—scmeticism, the
cry still goes up for a boycott.

If Mr. Chase and his Fair Play committee want
to look around, they might observe cases where
Northern football teams play teams in the South
and notice how often a ﬁrst—string Negro boy will
be in the starting lineup that day. Or the com-
mittee might. look even to those communities where
-a Negro appearing on the visiting team will be
invariably helped from the ﬁeld after a varying
number of plays, depending upon how rugged he is.

Charity begins at home; so might fair play in
sports. WAS the grass grows greener in the neigh-

_ 'bor’s yard, sodo the abuses seem more spectacular

seem to be putting a lot of effort into this boycott

last, thus accounting for the slight in-
crease in the size of the volume. Em-
ployees of all divisions of the Univer-
sity are included. These take in the
Johnstqwn and Erie Centers and the
Downtown Division.

‘The list reveals the fact that there
are 379 unmarried persons holding
University positions. Of those who
were designated as unmarried in last
year’s directory, 15 who are still listed
in this edition have been married
within the past 12 months. These in-

In addition there are ﬁve Browns and

First place on the list belongs to
Dr. Raymond L. Abel, professor of pe-
troleum reﬁning, for the second year
in succession. The anchor position is
held down by Janet Zwinggi, teacher

assistant professor of medicine, who
brought up the rear in the last print-

The time which elapsed before the

In regard to the earthquakes which

Mr. Rutherford said that the quakes
were probably due to the pressure
which was created by immense

mors, according to calculations, was

Panther Runners Get Fourth I

In I _C_A_A Cross-Country Run

Pitt Freshmen Capture
Fifth In Yearling
Championships

Michigan State pulled a mild sur-
prise in the 27th running of the IC4A
cross-country over the historic Van
Cortlandt Park course, Monday, in win-
ning the meet for the third successive
year by the decisive margin of 63
points over Manhattan’s barriers.

A youthful band of Panthers record-
ed a distinct upset by placing fourth
behind only the Michigan State and
Manhattan schools, in addition to Cor-
nell. Olson’s runners showed only one
dual victory of the year and a Junior
AMA title before 3 o'clock, Monday.

Today, they stand fourth in the
country as compared to their sixth rat-
ing of last year in this same event. A
pre-meet favored Nittany Lion roared_
not so loud in sixth with 215 points,
two places behind their Jungle Cat
dual victims of two weeks ago.

Steins will not be raised too high
in the Maine camp for some time, as
last year's runner-up passed up the
ﬁrst six places to rest serenely in the
seventh notch.

Red Tost crossed the ﬁnish line in
14th place for the ﬁrst Panther score.
Franklyn Theriault, sophomore, cop-
ped 35th, with George Cook in 40th,
Charles Great in 44th, and Alex Leg-
gin in 57th for a team score of 186
points.

Gene Venzke, ‘Lawson Robertson’s
ﬁne miler at; ,Pennsylv_ania-, monopoliz-
ed the ‘individual’ show until the -ﬁnal.

Michigan State leader, outsprinted
him to win by ﬁve seconds in the fast
time of 26 minutes and 23 seconds. In-
cidentall)’. Gene’s ﬁne title bid may be
attributed to the approaching Olym-
pics in Berlin next summer. I

Bechtold Cracks Record

The winning ﬁve from ‘Lansing com-
piled probably a modern low record
total of 30 points, placing men in ﬁrst,
third, sixth, ninth, and eleventh posi-
tions. Bechtold cracked the existing
record, held by a teammate, Tom Ot-
tey, by some ﬁve minutes over a short-
ened route.

Pitt's yearling squad, in the fresh-
man competition'for-the ﬁrst time, per-
formed creditably by copping ﬁfth
place with a total of 114. Manhattan's
ﬁrst-year boys copped the team title
handily with a low net of 29 points, in
spite of Charles Southard‘s individual
victory for the Syracuse fresh in the
three-mile event.

Syracuse, with 83 markers, was out
in front of -Cornell, third with 93, and
Princeton,»-fourth with 95. Penn State,
sixth,’ followed Pitt, and others in the
ﬁrst 1_0__j_ncluded Fordham, Columbia,
Yale, and-New York University.

Figuring in the Pitt frosh total of
114 points were: Frank Bonarati,
20th; F'red‘Tredinnick, 21st; Jim Fil-
son, 27th; A. Zamborski, 29th; and
R. W. -Cogswell, 33rd.

Following Pitt in the varsity run
over the shortened ﬁve-mile course
were: New York University, 200;
Penn State, 215; and Maine, 216.

The ﬁrst ten to cross the ﬁnish line
in this varsity championship climb in-
cluded: ﬁrst, J. Bechtold, Mich. State;
second, Gene Venzke, Penn; third,
K. A. VVait, Mich. State; fourth, Wood-
land, Yale; ﬁfth, Jim Rafferty, Ford-
ham; sixth, J. Nelson Gardner, Mich.

Schriber To Call Meeting
Of Business Group Today

 

Elmer E. Schriber, Jr., BA37, has
called a meeting of Pitt Business "In-
stitute for , this . afternoon. at 2:30
o'clock in Room 200, Alumni Hall.

gestions‘ and help arrange plans for
the future." - 

All members and ‘those. interested

in joining are urged to attend.

Skibos, Trojans

Are Next Foes
For Pitt Eleven

All will be quiet on the football
front until November 28, on which
date the Panthers will meet their
rivals from across the hollow, Carne-
gie Tech, in the annual Thanksgiving
_Day struggle.

Following that game, Pitt will close
its football program for the 1935 sea-
son, with a transcontinental journey
to Los Angeles, California, where the
local eleven will try to make amends
for a couple of Rose Bowl lickings
against the Trojans of Southern Cali-
fornia on December 14.

The holiday encounter, with the Tar-
tans will be the last one between the
two local schools on that day as next
season Penn State will be returned to
that spot on the football schedule.
Tech will be met earlier in the season
next year.

Football warfare with the Skibos
began in 1906 when the Blue and
Gold team administered a. 31-0 white-
washing to the Plaid. From that time
up until 1923, a Panther eleven was
victorious in every meeting, scoring‘
victories on eight different occasions.
The great 1910 aggregation gave the
Skibos their worst trouncing, taking a
35-0 decision.

After a lapse of four years in grid
relations, from 1919 to 1923, the two
teams swung into action in the lat-
ter,year_ with the Kilties surprising
-Pitt "with «a 7-2 triumph. -’l‘-he—follow-
ing year Tech scored another victory,
this time by a 6-0 count.

Playing in the Stadium 'Pitt’s 1925
outﬁt regained some of its former
prestige against the Skibos with a
12-0 victory, but went down to a 14-0
licking in 1926 when Jimmy Donohue,
Tartan halfback, had a good afternoon,
The 1927 season found the Panthers,
led by Welch and Hagan, too power-
iul, and the Carnegie boys lost, 23-7.

In 1928 the present coach of Tech.
Howard Harpster, went over the goal
line on a quarterback sneak to give
his team a 6-0 win. That was the last
time a Plaid eleven downed a Pitt
team. Since 1928, the Panthers have
run up a win streak of -six straight.
making their all-time record against
the Tartans, 17 victories in 21 starts.

~The players came out of the Ne-
braska game with the usual amount
of injuries, Patrick, Dalle Tezze, and
LaRue receiving ailments which kept
them out of play during the second
half. All will be in shape for the Car-
negie Tech game, however.

In the past two games the Panthers
have moved — several - notches-~ nearer
the top in the national rankings due
to their ﬁne play. In toppling the
Cornhuskers, the local eleven elimi-
nated a team which might have re-
ceived Rose Bowl nomination had it
defeated Pitt.

Kappa Sigs Beat Phi Delts
By Margin Of First Down

 

Winners To Meet Defending

Titleholders In Last Round;

Sigs, Phi Delts Battle To Scoreless Deadlock .

 

Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta Theta

fought to a scoreless tie in the mud

on the Trees gymnasium ﬁeld, Monday, with the Kappa Sigs making it four
in a row by the slim margin of one ﬁrst down.

By virtue of this win, the boys opposite Phi Delt-way on North Dith-
ridge clash with Delta Tau Delta, defending champion, for the Greek title

on the Schenley Oval ﬁeld, Friday.

The mud almost had the better of: .

the Interfrat gridders as they slipped
and slid on the slippery turf before
nearly 100 partisan rooters. Phi Delta
Theta registered its only ﬁrst down
of the game late in the -ﬁrst half on a
15-yard Kappa Sig penalty for running-
into the kicker.

The winners rang up both of their
ﬁrst downs in the second period. Mc-
Munn’s dash around right end was
good for 12 yards and the initial mark-
er that tied up the score early in the
second half.

Bernie Summer, Kappa Sig guard,
proved to be the hero of the fray when
he snagged a 10-yard heave from Mar-
ty -Groat on the 20-yard stripe with
only ﬁve minutes to play remaining.

Phi Delta Theta on several occasions
averted a Kappa Sig score by desper-
ate defensive maneuvers. Early in the
ﬁnal half, Groat drove the red and
white to the Phi Delt one-yard marker
with third and goal to go, only to lose
two on a dash around left tackle and
pass incomplete to Mahoney over the
goal line on the last down.

Penalties for holding, illegal block-
ing, off side, in fact almost every~pen-
alty in the book, slowed up the con-
test. Three 15-yard penalties hurt
the Kappa Sig offensive threats.

A strong Kappa Sig line proved to
be the decisive factor in the outcome.
As is customary in Greek “warfare,"
numerous disputesserved to arouse.
both the spectators and the players.

Al Duff and Nate Hepburn make the
Delts a ruling favorite to repeat in the
1935 ﬁnals of the Interfrat touch foot-
ball tourney against the Kappa Sigs,
Friday. Both men rate pre-game threat
roles on their passing and all-around
ball handling abilities,

Novices Gather
At Trees Pool
For Swim Meet

The second of a series of invita-
tional swimming meets will be held
this evening at 7 o'clock at Trees
pool. Entry blanks have been sent
out to all the swimming clubs in this
district. Events will be held under
the auspices of the AMA of the AAU.

A large entry list is expected for
this meet. At the ﬁrst meet held two
weeks ago, 75 competitors took part,
which indicates that the meets are
likely to prove highly successful.

Coach Corr, director of the meet,
hopes that these affairs will help to
build up the waning interest in swim-
ming in the Pittsburgh area. Events
are held for boys in all age groups.

Events included in this week’s pro-
gram are: 20-yard backstroke for
boys 12 years and under; 40-yard
backstroke for boys under 16; 100-
yard open backstroke for men; and
fancy diving. Prizes will be awarded
the winners of each event.

Russ Lindberg, who was unable to
compete in the last meet because "of
sinus infection in his nose, may also
be forced to the sidelines in this meet.
Coach Corr does not wish to.endan-
ger “Lindy” for the coming varsity
season by letting him swim before he
has entirely recovered. - -- - ~

Competition in the events for the
younger boys will be especially keen.
Each club is trying hard to win the
highest number of points in each
meet, as well as score the highest
number of points for the series of
meets. , -
