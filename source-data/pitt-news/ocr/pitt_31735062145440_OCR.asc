BULLETIN

 

“Hello Again” will be the name
of the 1934 Cap and Gown show,
according to an announcement
yesterday by Walter Rome, assist.
ant dean. Mr. Rome also an-
nounced that the Civic Club will
sponsor the opening performance
of “Hello Again,” which will
take place Thursday evening,
April 19, at the Nixon Theater.

 

Names of participants in the April
Cap and Gown revue are still being
released sporadically. Today William
Marlatt, director, revealed the names
of the chorus members.

The ﬁrst tentative list includes
twenty-three men slated for the men’s
chorus, and twenty-one for the wo-
men dancers. All participants have
now been selected for the cast,
octette and the unfeatured singing
and dancing roles.

With no deﬁnite theme providing
for continuity, Marlatt said, no cast
member will take the limelight
throughout the show. In the individual
skits, it is planned, different men
will replace the “one-hero, one-
heroine” policy of the past.

Reliable reports intimate that some-
thing of a shakeup has altered the
blackouts, One of the skits announced
in Friday’s News has already been
blue-penciled, our unpublicized au-
thority asserts, and another is going
through a violent “reorganization.”
What is happening to the skits still
being considered is not for publica-
tion.

Men’s chorus selections include: C.
E. Allcroft, C36, ‘Wilbur Baer, C36,

on mimeographed sheets to the stu-
dents of Dr, John M. Ferguson's

 The list, compiled by Dr. Ferguson,
includes all of the boards, bureaus

Association Laws Tomorrow

Present Plans
Lead To Finish
Of Cathedral

To Ask Cooperation Of Alumni,
Students And Friends; No
Separate Group Drive

 

of Learning coupled with the “Finish
the -Cathedral Drive” the actual com-
,pletion of our ‘‘tall building’ will no
‘longer be a vision, but a reality.

Student hopes for the ﬁnishing of
the building which have long been
dormant are now aroused and a feel-
ing of enthusiasm and desire for a
ﬁnished structure is paramount. Co-
operation ot‘ alumni, students and
friends of the University will be
asked, but there will be no separate
group solicitations.

If the University can complete con-
struction and equipment of the first
twenty ﬂoors, including the Com-
mons room, and “rough ﬁnish” the
upper twenty, all students now at-
tending classes on the old campus,
save those studying medicine, den-
tistry and chemistry, will be trans-
ferred to the Cathedral. The rooms
in the upper part of the building are
smaller than those in the lower
twenty ﬂoors and their completion is
not as urgent as the others. It will
be possible to complete the rough
ﬁnished rooms out of the regular ex-
penses of the University when they
are needed.

With interest in the completion of
the ‘Cathedral becoming a civic topic
throughout the city, hopes for a quick
and successful campaign have been
greatly stimulated. Dr, John G. Bow-
man, Chancellor of the University.
struck the keynote of both civic and
student attitude when he said, “The

--desire that the Cathedral of Leraning

be ﬁnished is in the air, and its com-
pletion will mark the beginning of a
new era in education at the Univer-
sity.”

Tyson To Speak
On Workers’ Aid

Inquiry Speaker Will Advocate
Unemployment Insurance

Unemployment insurance the bug-
aboo of Pennsylvania legislatures.
will be discussed by Dr. Francis D,
Tyson, professor of economics, at In-
quiry forum in 315, Alumni hall, to-
morrow afternoon at 12:30 o’clock.

The question of unemployment in-
surance which is gaining favor
throughout the country presents may
problems in economic and social
ﬁelds in regards to its direct and fu-
ture results on the welfare of the
worker and the national state. It is
these aspects that Dr. Tyson will
analyze and point out possible solu-
tions.

Dr. Tyson believes the most tangi-
ble remedy for seasonal and tech-
nological unemployment is “repre-
sented by state laws for unemploy-
ment reserves based on our success-
ful experience with workmen’s com-
pensation in the accident ﬁeld.” In
the social aspects of unemployment
insurance, the speaker will stress the
present menace to the health, mor-
als and welfare of whole sections of
our people have been subject as to
the direct result of the hurriedly set
up and expensivoly administered
system of private and public relief,
even though organized relief during

and better administered than in any
earlier depression. An outline of Dr.
Tyson’s speech appears in this issue
on page two.

At yesterday’s meeting Miss Blatt
gave an outline of the work to be
done a.nd the general principles which
will be followed by the Pitt delega-
tion in their rewriting of the state
constitution. The principles as given
by Miss Blatt are, ﬁrst, there will be
a striving for less legislative matter
in the constitution, giving the legis-
lature more discretion in their work,
and, secondly, the inclusion of an
easier a.nd more workable amending
process. In the chairman’s tentative
plans the campus work will be
divided into nine committees, each
taking a separate phase of the work
and rewriting that portion of the
nresent constitution. These commit-
tees will be headed by student and
l 1"-zculty members, who will act as ad-
? risory boards for the students.

 Thyrsa W. Amos Attends

terday morning after attending the
ﬁrst meeting of the council of joint
planning of programs and projects
for personnel organizations, which
was held in New York city this
weekend.

Miss Amos was appointed to the

The American Approach To

 Unemployment Insurance
By Dr. Francis D. Tyson

As the United States faces an all too uncertain eco-
nomic and political future, perhaps the most vital ques-
tion before the nation is, “Can we be foresighted and
forehanded about unemployment?” For even with over
four million in CWA emergency employment, conserva-
tive estimates indicate 10 million workers still unem-
ployed.

This lack of work constitutes a major disaster for our
industrial order and creates the greatest social problem
of our civilization. Unemployment, or involuntary idle-
ness in normal work time, is the Achilles heel--the vul-
nerable spot—in the modern body politic. Our demo-
cratic economic order is in constant danger from the
growth of revolutionary unrest, Fascist and Communist,
unless a remedy for this evil is quickly found.

Mass unemployment of the sort from which we now
suffer comes only with depressions, or severe business
dislocations, which recur at seven to ten year intervals,
and fortunately are often, as in 1914-15. and 1920-21, short
lived. The American community has been woefully near-
sighted about unemploynient—like the Irishman who
said, “Sure, me foresight always comes afterward.” And
long continued unemployment, us in the present prolong-
ed depression serves to direct public attention to the con-
tinuing causes of unemployn1ent——(1) seasonal, due to
weather, and to style, changes; and (2) technological un-
employment———due to temporary displacement of workers
by new machines and methods; such unemployment in-
creases apace in the depression and the workers are only
re-absorbed after shorter or longer intervals by an ex-
panding market for goods.

What are we to do about this baffling problem of ever
recurring intensity? All students of our economic order
agree that the hazards of unemployment are inevitable
What is the best time to install in our economic system
minor devices that will remedy and check unemployment
in the future, or at least, allay its terrible pangs?

There is universal agreement that the most tangible
remedy in the U. S. is represented by state laws for un-
employment reserves, based on our successful experience
with workmen’s compensation in the accident field. Here
some progress has recently been made. Two years ago
Vvisconsin took the lead in passing the Groves Bill, which
requests employers of the state to set up 2% payroll re-
serves. to a coverage of 175,000 workers, with maximum
of $100 protection for permanent employes. Full benefits
are $12.50 a week for eight weeks, carefully safeguarded.
In addition to limited liability, funds are isolated by ﬁrms
or plants, and administration is largely by industry it-
self. The continued depression has led to postponement
of the operation of the act until a continuing rise in em-
ployment and payrolls has occurred. This is our only
legislation to date.

In Pennsylvania the Governor’s Commission which re-
ported a year ago, had :1 clear majority favorable to con-
structive action, but we could not ﬁnd a formula of agree-
ment as to what form such action should take. The labor
group favored and introduced :1 measure of the Wisonsin
and New York type. But others favored a legislative
commission with adequate appropriation and administra-
tive powers.

Vvith regard to stimulation by the Federal Government
under constitutional limitations some of the measures
sponsored by Senator VVagner are signiﬁcant. The Wag-
ner Bill for coordination of State Employment Oﬁices,

so unwisely vetoed by President Hoover, passed the last
Congres sas a valid administration measure. And of
course improved State Employment Offices will be essen- l
tial to good administration of unemployment insurance.
President Roosevelt may be able to strengthen the work
of the Council of Governors to secure joint action among
states of an industrial region like the Northeast or the
Middle Atlantic states in establishing unemployment in-
surance. Such a development will meet the main argu-
ment of opponents of unemployment reserves, namely,
that of interstate competition. And the latter point has
great political, if little economic validity, in claiming that
industrial costs would be increased by reserve provisions.
Senator Wagner has recently introduced :1 new measure,
the Wagner-Lewis Bill. based on the interesting device
of a 3% excise tax related to payrolls and providing for
exemption of contributions by employers to state reserve
or insurance funds.

And organized labor, earlier skeptical of state action.
has recently swung into line. The AF of L, our conser-
vative labor movement, for instance, has reversed its po-
sition of opposition to state unemployment compensation
or insurance, and passed, almost unanimously at Cincin-
nati, a resolution calling for 3% employers’ contributions

The American plans should be carefully distinguished
from the national systems of England and Germany,
where state contributions have altered the insurance
character of the schemes, and confused the issue by mix-
ing public relief with insurance. The term “dole” is,
of course, a misnomer, as applied to Britain. Their sys-
tem is certainly not :1 “dole” in our relief parlance. Even
in those countries, however, despite the criticism issued
by the National Industrial Conference Board, :1 thorough
study of their systems and the testimony of leaders of all
classes, convinces an impartial observer of ::he_superior-
ity of organized provision for unemployment losses, as
against the relative chaos and inadequacy of our badly
administered dole. On this issue, however, it is only fair
to point out that organized relief in this depression, par-
ticularly since the aid of the Reconstruction Finance Cor-
poration and Emergency Relief Administration is much
more adequate and better administered than in any ear-
lier depression period. Distress has, as you know, been
severe. At the peak of need last year, it is estimated at
\V-asliingtoli that some 41/3, million families were on relief
—~a total of over 20 million souls. The number has since
fallen toward 31/2 million——--a total of some 16 million peo-
ple, but will scarcely be further reduced until basic in—.
dustry resumes operations. By any reasonable standard,
the relief grants have been pitifully inadequate, and in
even the biggest cities the American dole make no provi-
sion for payment of rent, light and heat, or a small cash
remnant for church, insurance, and recreation payments.
Food order relief has denied an important section of our
population their American birthright of disposing their
income by their own good judgnient. Inevitably, there
has been undermining of physique, character, and self-
reliance.

For instance, in our Allegheny county CWA work, up
to the end of February, the staff had referred some 43.000
workers, of whom only some 3,500 had been recalled or
formally cancelled. Yet this supply was necessary to
provide an employed total slightly in excess of 32,000.

Mr. R. W. Gibbs, supervisor of the Federal-State Em-
ployment oﬁice here (where 175,000 are registered), esti-
mates that not 10%, as was early indicated, but some
23% of those referred have failed to report for work.
There are indications that in some relief districts more
than :1 third of those referred to work from the lists did
not report. The large number of those not reporting con-
stitutes zi. challenging community and social work prob-
lem. Some, of course, have sickened, or moved away.
For some, despite careful administrative planning, assign-
ment has been too far from home‘. Some may not have
had clothes, shoes, or care fare. But with most, prob-
ably, we are dealing with the human ill-effects of at pro-
longed lay—off and of the “dole system;” the problem may
prove upon further study to be one of weakened physique.
lowered morale and the disintegration of work standards
with the long depression and enforced idleness. Effort
is now being made to throw light on this vital public
problem.

The so—called American plans for unemployment insur-
ance are not only based on the precedent of our compen-
sation laws, but appeal to many industrialists because of
the recent fortunate experience of the latter in setting up
capital reserves out of surplus in good years, thus per-
mitting them to meet ﬁxed charges and pay the dividends
in bad times like the present. It seems only fair that
the employe, recognized as a joint partner in business,
should also be partially protected.

A case may be made, too, for the possible preventive
effects of insurance provision, in directing the attention
of the employer——who is the real leader of our economic
community and perhaps the only one who can do much
about the matter——to experimentation with methods of re-
ducing seasonal and technological unemployment. If re-
serves can be made adequate enough, again, they might
even provide a reservoir of purchasing power to prevent
business from falling to the disastrous low levels of the
past two years. Here certainly the old adage holds, “An
ounce of prevention is worll1 :1 pound of cure.”

In any case, the overburdened taxpayer would have
been saved millions of dollars of expenditures had we
entered this depression in the possession of reserves ac-
cumulated in the good years from 1922 to 1929. And the
present menace to the health, morals, and welfare of
whole sections of our people might have been avoided,
along with the wastes incident to the hurriedly set up
and expensively administered system of private and pub-
lic relief. Attention must also be directed to the inap-
propria.teness and injustice of our methods of dealing on
a charitable basis with able-bodied and alert employee.
out of work and income through no fault of their own;
they are now handled along with paupers and other un-
employables.

For the long run, In any case, we may trust the per-
sistent pioneering spirit of the American people. That
spirit stresses initiative and cooperation, and is sure to
provide, when enlightened on the issue, constructive and
practical plans applicable to our new industrial frontier
conditions. With the New Deal we may take hope. A1-
ready a dozen or more legislative commissions have re-
ported favorably on unemployment reserves or insurance.
The time for political action has come. We are assured
of supporting legislation i'1'om ‘Washington to stimulate
the movement, as the President and the administration
are fully committed on the issue. Even more important,
many forward looking Americans of all classes are now
studying effective and waste-saving experiments to meet
the costs of unemployment. The gravest hazard of our
industrial civilization may soon be met in even more
economical ways than in older lands, even though he-
latedly, by the practical genius of our creative people.
In the effort to emerge from this great depression our
citizens have certainly lived up to the high Anglo-Saxon
tradition of meeting crisis and disaster calmly and con-
structively. Achievemcnt lies near at hand; during the
coming year or two we may expect the issue of unem-
ployment reserves or insurance to emerge from the realm
of academic and commission discussion, and become one
of statesnianship and administration~-an accepted in-
tegral part of the New Deal.

Education School
Gets Applications

 

Siedle Describes Procedure For
Admission To Upper Division

 

Applications from pre-education
sophomores for admission to the up-
per division years of the School of
Education are now being received, ac-
cording to an announcement made to-
day by Theodore A. Siedle, assistant
to the dean. Applications should be
ﬁled in the oflice of the dean between
now and April 7.

Students other than those enrolled
in pre-education curricula, who meet
the standards established by the fac-
ulty of the School of Education, may
be considered for admission to the
school, These students should also
make application at this time.

At the time the application is ﬁled,
the student will be granted an inter-
view or will be scheduled for a future
interview with a member of the com-
mittee on admissions. The results of
this interview and the satisfying of
the other criteria of selection will de-
termine admission to the School of
Education. The other standards in-
clude superior intelligence rating,
average or better scholarship (grades
)f C or better in all subjects), superior
scholarship (grades of B or better) in
the subject of major interest, satis-
factory health rating, and superior
ability in the use of oral and written
English

The pre-education regulations be-
came effective in September, 1932.
They are being applied this spring for
the ﬁrst time to regular four-year stu-
dents.

If a. student fails to meet the ad-
mission requirements at the end of
his sophomore year, he will have, ac-
cording to Mr. Siedle, another oppor-
tunity. In the event that a student’s
scholarship is not satisfactory, he may
remain in a pre-education curriculum
during his junior year, and apply for
admission at the end of that time if
he feelsthat he has improved his
scholastic rating, If, however, a stu-
dent fails to satisfy the selective re-
quirements for admission during his

' junior year, he may be required to

take work during the summer session
if he expects to complete require-
ments for a teacher’s certiﬁcate at
the end of four years,

Complete details about the pre—edu-
cation program and about the other
choices open to persons who desire to
teach is available in pamphlet form.
Copies of the pamphlet may be had
at the office of the School of Educa-
tion, Room, 210, State hall.

Cats Go South
For Convention

Leave Next Tuesday To Play
Exhibition Before Coaches

Now that the regular basketball
season is over and done, Dr. Carlson
and his Golden Panthers. are turning
to thoughts of the sunny south and
Georgia, peaches. For in exactly
one week from today two, and possi-
bly three, automobile loads of Pitt
players and coaches will be heading

south to attend the annual conven-
tion of the National Association of
Basketball Coaches at Atlanta, Geor-
gia.

The itinerary of the trip, as ar-
ranged tentatively by Carlson, calls
for a jaunt of nearly 2,000 miles, in-
cluding visits to nine states and the
District of Columbia. The trip south
will be made through Maryland,
Washington, D. C., Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina and then
on to Atlanta. The return will take
the party on a farther west route,
through Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio,
and back to the Keystone state.

Plans at present call for a two-day
trip on the route going. The Univer-
sity of Richmond has extended an un-
limited inv‘;itat‘»iown to the Panthers
and Carlson may choose to let his
boys work out there to loosen up
kinks after a day’s driving. Columbia is
another possible stopping place on the
tour, The party will arrive in At-
lanta for the opening of the conven-
tion on Thursday, March 29.

Pitt is scheduled to oppose the De
Kalb Teacher's college, winners of
the Little Nineteenth conference tilt,
in an exhibition game during the con-
tab. The Universities of Kentucky
and South "Carolina will also have
teams in action. These affairs will
run only 20 minutes, or half of a
regulation game.

While there is no deﬁnite word as
yet concerning those fortunate
basketeers who will make the trip, it
is believed that eight players will be
in the party. Claire Cribbs, who has
now been out of the hospital six days.
is expected to go along but will in
all probability be withheld from any
strenuous action unless his injured
knee shows remarkable improvement
in the coming week.

Football Coaches I
Confronted With
Difficult Task

Eight Of Last-T-dd-r’s Starting

Eleven Graduate; Coaches
Watch Fundamentals

Lostr—Eight Regulars!

   

Saturday's weather was made to
order for Coach Jock Sutherland and
his staff of assistants, who are con-
ducting spring football training for
all candidates for the 1934 grid squad.
Percy C. Browne, custodian of equip-
ment, handed out complete uniforms
to eighty candidates on Saturday and
about twenty more yesterday, which

brings the total of candidates now
equipped up to approximately 100.
The coaching staff is confronted

with an exceptionally hard task this:

spring, It must ﬁnd men to ﬁll eight
positions that were vacated by seniors,
who played their last collegiate game
against Carnegie Tech. The eight
members of the 1933 team who are
lost by graduation are: Onder, Sebas-
tian, Hogan, Skladany, VValton, Tim-
mons, O’Dell and Meredith.

The coaches started right in coach-
ing the candidates in the general
fundamentals of the game. Assistant
Coach Bill Kern worked with the
tackles, Mike Milligan the guards,
Eddie Hirshberg the end aspirants,
who are after the wing position played
by All-American Skladany last year,
Howdy ()’Dell and Eddie Baker the
backs, Ralph Daugherty the centers,
and Skip Gougler is working the new
men.

There are some candidates who
have had two years of varsity ex-
perience. Captain Hartwig has had
two years of varsity experience and
should come back next year better
than ever, and play his guard position
as well as any guard in Pitt’s foot-
ball history. George Shotwell, Izzy
Weinstock, Munjas, Hoel, Weisen-
baugh, Olejnicsak, Ken Ormiston,
Nick Kliskey, Rooker and Kutz have
all been on the squad‘ for two years.
The sophomore candidates look prom-
ising, but need a lot of Instruction be-
fore next fall. I

Varsity Manager Jess Pennington
would like any freshman and soph-
omore students who are interested in
becoming one of the managers to re-
port to him in the Stadium dressing
room this afternoon after 2:30 o’clock.
Students who qualify for the positions
throughout spring training season will
accompany the team to training camp
next fall in the capacity of ap-
prentice managers.

McKinley High
Swimmers Win

 

Denny and Schmeiler Lower Pool
Championship Records

The McKinley high school swim-
ming team from Canton, Ohio, won
the Pitt interscholastic

winners scored thirty points, which
more than doubled the number of
points scored by the second place
winner, Erie East. Munhall high
school, with only three swimmers en-
tered, won third place with thirteen
points, just one point behind Erie
East.

Pete Breuckle, of Wells high school,
of Steubenville, was the only schol-
astic swimmer to establish a new
pool scholastic record. Breuckle low-
ered the 220—yard freestyle record one
second. His winning time Was 2:25.

In the University championships
Jack Denny set up a new record for
the 100-yard freestyle event, :54 4-5,
which is one second better than the
former mark made by B115 Wright in
1927. Schmeiler bettered his last
year’s record in the 200-Yard breast‘
stroke race, covering the distance in
2:37 3-5_

This Saturday night Coach Pat
Corr will enter three strong relay
teams in a Senior AMA 200-yard re-
lay race, which will take place in
the Pittsburgh Athletic association.
The present record for the 200-yard
reay, which is 1:41, has been bet-
tered by the Panthers in practice.

Coach Pat Corr will enter his 400-
yard relay team in the National In-
tercollegiate swimming meet, which
will take place in Columbus, Ohio, on
March 30 and 31. The team is not
yet certain, but the quartet is likely
to be made up of: Jack Hanna, Her-
man Adlersburg, Russell Lindberg and
Jack Denny.

Delta Tau Delta
Wins Cage Title

Phi Kappa, Second In League B,
Beats Phi Gamma Delta

 

 

 

Delta Tau Delta earned the right
to meet the winner of the Tech inter-
fraternity basketball league in a
game scheduled for Tuesday, March
27, by nosing out Phi Delta Theta at
the Stadium pavilion last Thursday
night. The ﬁnal score was 21-18.

The Phi Delts had all the better of
it in the ﬁrst half, holding their riv-5
Ials to one field goal. Baxter and
'Glassfoi-d did ﬁne work to give the
Phi Delts a 11-9 lead as the half
ended.

The winners came back strong in
the third quarter, staging a rally that
saw the count knotted at 15-15. Arn
Green, who had been playing a fine
brand of ball all evening, dropped in
a ﬁeld goal to give the Delts a lead
which they never relinquished.

In the preliminary game Phi Kappa
won from Phi Gamma Delta, Quaren.
tello played best for the winners
while Sawin scored the most points
for the losing ﬁve.

Panthers Defeat Reserve
Red Cats In Final Game

Pitt’s Golden Panthers closed their
regular season’s basketball schedule
by trouncing the Western Reserve Red
Cats at Cleveland Wednesday night.
The ﬁnal count of 40-29 did not reveal
the margin of superiority which the
Carlsonmen exhibited over their
rivals.

Pitt showed a. brilliant passing and
shooting game throughout, only an
atrocious weakness at the foul line
preventing them from running up a
larger score.

Skip Hughes led the scorers with 11
points and Pete Noon starred by out-
scoring the famed Pontius, nine to
eight.

The lineup:

Reviewing The

By Charles A, Ruch

When the present edition of Dr.
Carlson’s Golden Panther basketball
team wrote ﬁnis to the regular sea-
son’s schedule with a victory over
Western Reserve, it completed one
of the ﬁnest season’s records among
the country’s major college teams
this year. The ﬁnal count gave the
Panthers a record of 18 wins in 21
games.

Starting the season off with a.
game with Georgetown, played as a:
part of Dr. Carlson’s fourth annuali
basketball clinic, Pitt took over then‘
Georgetowners, 34-31. Although it
required 10 minutes for the scoring
of the first ﬁeld goal in this game,
the Panthers found themselves after
Claire Cribbs had netted the ﬁrst?
t‘wo—pointer of the season and they
kept. the game well in hand from
there on.

The next weekend the Panthers
embarked upon their “suicide” trip
to the midwest, where they met Pur-
due. Northwestern and Butler in four
days. The Cats managed to take a,
game from the Northwestern ﬁve but;
they lost out to Butler and Purdue,I
the latter team eventually going on?
to win the Big Ten title. ,

Panther fortunes improved consider-I
ably. Minnesota, Ohio State, andl
Temple were taken into camp quite]
handily. Much credit for these threel

The ROTC team has been selected
to represent this area in the National
Intercollegiate match for this year.
The ﬁve highest teams in each corps
area are selected, which means that
45 of the best riﬂe teams in the coun-
try will be competing for the three
silver cups which will be awarded
the three highest teams.

In this match 15 men shoot, the
ten highest scores in each stage de-
termining the ﬁnal team score. There
are four stages, ﬁred in three dimer-
ent weeks. The shooting must be
completed by April 15.

Although the entire set of scores
for the William Randolph Hearst
trophy match are not yet in, some of
the incomplete scores are encouraging.
If the late marks are as high as the
ﬁrst, the team may rank high in the,
contest. a

 

Wrestlers Train
For AMA Match

Frosh Team Calls For Candidates ,-
In Three Weight Classes '

 

 

Although the varsity wrestling
team’s collegiate schedule terminated I
with the match against Waynesburg
March 2, the season will not formal-
ly end until after the Senior Allegheny
Mountain association championship
matches which will take place in the
East Liberty YMCA in the latter part
of the month.

In the Junior AMA competition, the
Panthers tied for ﬁrst place. Five of
the Pitt wrestlers were crowned Ju-
nior chamns. and one was runner-up.
The AMA Junior title holders on the
team are: Norman Evans, 118
pounds; Paul Hinchberger, 125-pound
class; Captain Bradford Ilsley, 145-
pound class; and William Cover, 135-
pound champion. Arthur Willets was
runner-up in the 165—pound class.

In spite of the fact that there is a
decided step from junior to senior
competition, it is apparent from the
rapid development of several of the
team’s members that the Panther
chances for taking places looks rather
promising. V

The lack of frosh wrestlers in three
weight divisions makes the scheduling
of more freshman wrestling matches
almost impossible, With vacancies in
the 125, 135, a.nd 175-pound classes, it
is almost impossible for the team to
make a favorable showing; so until
freshman candidates ﬁll these posi-
tions no matches will be scheduled.

At present the team members in-
clude: Babcock, Conley, Hermes,
