The Cap & Gown club journeyed to
Tarentum last Friday where_ they pre-
sented “,‘The Maxixe Gi.rl.’.,’_ under... the
auspices of the Allegheny Valley Gen-
eral Hospital before an enthusiastic
and appreciative’ audience that ﬁlled

‘every available seat in the Nixon,

Theater’. .

Both cast and chorus were at their
best and many people who also saw
the performances in Pittsburgh re-
marked ‘that it was just as good as
before. The chorus girls were new
dresses which were more attractive
than the ones‘ worn at the production
in the Schenley Theater. ‘ 

BIG EASTERN mun 
 BY»GHEMlSTRY HEAD

As a token of appreciation of the
study and investigations which Direc-
tor Alexander. Silverman, head of the
Chemistry Department, has conducted
along the lines of glass and glass con-
struction, he has received in the last
week a series of invitations to present

the results of his research in the form -

of a lecture before some of the big-
gest colleges and universities of the

east, including Yale, Columbia, and,‘

Cornell universities.

This lecture, entitled the “CheI‘nis-x

try and Technology of Glass,” ‘has
been already delivered by ‘Professor
Silverman in a previous series of lec-

tures in Detroit, Mich. Soon after his ‘

return to the University he received
several invitations to deliver the same
lecture? on a similar trip to the .east.
On Friday March 19 he will address
the Society of Chemical Industry, at
the Chemists’ Club of New York City.
Here, by special request, the lecture
will be supplemented by a paper on
“Uses of Barium Compounds in
Glass.” On Monday, March 22, he
will speak at Columbia‘ University,
while on .Wednesday, March 24, the
same address will be delivered to the
New Haven Section of the American

Chemical "Society at Yale University.

The scenes of the ﬁnal roundup‘ will
be. at the College of the‘City of New
York, on March 25, and at Cornel Uni-
versity on Friday, March 26._ ‘

Director Silverman also ‘received an

invitation from the New York State

School of Ceramics at Alfred Univer-

sity but was unable to arrange a date‘

in this case as the Alfred University
vacation occurs at.the‘same time as
the Pitt vacation, and no other open
date was available. He will leave

at the latter institution. _

acquitted themselves as usual, de-
spite the “ﬂustering” circumstances.
That the girls were up-to-date could
not be denied, especially when they.
sang a parody on I Want the Lad with
the Uniform entitled I Want the Boys
in the Pitt Glee Club. They also re-

vealed a remarkable knowledge of ~

Such diversions from the formal

program, of course, made the evening

very enjoyable; but it was made
doubly so by the dance which followed
the musical numbers. Our own club
made a very favorable impression, and
it is likely that they will be invited

again next year.

TWO HARD BATTLES;  

The Pitt debaters were losers‘ to
both Allegheny. College and Wooster
University in the intercollegiate con-
tests held Friday evening, March 12.
The question debated was: “Resolved,
that the United States should initiate
a policy of increasing governmental
responsibility for" the natives of the

Philippines, to culminate in indepen- '

dence about 1915.”_ Pitt was repre-
sented by two teams, one taking the
aﬁirmative andthe other the negative.

The aflirmative team, composed of
Florence, Melnich_ and Criep, met
Allegheny College in Thaw hall. This
debate was hotly contested; the Alle-
gheny team, composed of, Koehlen,
Bright and Witter, was given the de~ ‘
against facts and wits, and themore
clever team won. Both teams ‘were
equally strong in constructive argu-

spirit was shown. ' As fast as an ‘ar-
gument was produced another argu-
ment was produced to answer ’it. The
judges,- however, decided that Alle-
gheny wascthe stronger in the de-
strvuctive arguments and awarded

The negative team, composed of
Kornhauser, Bazél and Arther, met
Wooster College at Wooster, Ohio.
Although they presented strong con-
stuctive and destructive arguments,
the judges decided against them.

Wooster presented a formidable
team in Alexander, Miller and pr John-
son, these men showing that they wﬁre

e...
bating is given an important place at
Wooster and the room was crowded
with loyal students who appreciated)
their team and encouraged them to
victory. - -

The debators this year were under
classmen, the majority being fresh-
men. These men lacked experience,
but made upthis deﬁciency infspirit,
enthusiasm and application j to the
preiparation of material.

Candidates are ‘now"working hard
to land positions on the teams which
will represent Pitt in the debates with

A WORD OF APPRECIATION.

‘ As this is the last issue of the PITT
WEEKLY in which it is my pleasure
to act in the capacity of editor, I take
this opportunity to thank everyone

 

who has helped to make the paper

the success -that it now is.

Much credit is due the members of
the staff who have so faithfully given
their time and services to the up-
building of the paper. A diligent bus-
iness staff and a conscientious editorial
staff working in harmony form a
combination which is of unmeasurable
value.

I especially want to thank the
readers of the WEEKLY who have
sent from time to time letters of
commendation, letters- of criticism,
It is through these
letters largely that the editor is able
to discern whether or not the publica-
tion is serving its function.

The staff owes much to the mem-
bers of the advisory board who by
virtue of their newspaper knowledge
have been able to make suggestions
for the beneﬁt of the paper. Questions
have arisen at different times which
were very hard to settle, but after
consultation with the advisory board
the editor found a way out of the
difficulty and the {wise ‘course was
pursued.

I want to thank especially J. V.
Early. the eminent cartoonist, who has
unselﬁshly contributed from time to
time and has made it possible for the

. WEEKLY to publish cartoons far
_superior to those published in other

college papers. ‘

. I thank everyone who has helped
the publication in any way, and hope
that the same assistance and appreci-
ation will be given the new editor that
was accorded me in the past.

J. CLARE GEORGE,
Editor.

EXAMINATIONS AND THE
HONOR SYSTEM.

With the term examinations in our
midst, a new and near-at-hand inter-
est is ’given to the question of the
adoption of the honor system for Pitt.
During the former discussion, the
declaration was often made that the
speaker was heartily in favor of such
a system, but that he did not believe
the school was in such a condition as
to make the introduction of the new
plan a success. In other words, while
personally each one considered him-

- self to be perfectly capable of taking

examinations without faculty super-

, vision, he yet exhibited the un-christ-

ian and un-jewish attitude of believing
that his neighbor was incapable to do
the same, that he considers himself
in a state of “holier-than-thou” which
would shame the attitude of the
ancient pharisees. But at bottom, a
deﬁnite system is not “absolutely”
necessary for the application of honor,
although many of us believe that it
would be a great aid. Now is the
great opportunity for‘the skeptic, and
it seems t at he is the great majority,
to exercise this restraint of which‘ he
is capable and take these examinations
under an honor system self-imposed
and self-governed. By such an effort,
twofold results may be secured. Not
only will these men put into practice
whatﬁchey have been preaching, but
they ay also introduce that campaign
of education for the new system,

. the necessity for which we have heard
. so much. ’

 

NEW ATHLETIC HONORS.

 

With the victory over Swarthmore
last Saturday, the
basketball team brought to a close
the most successful season ever en-

joyed__by a quintet representing the

of, possible sixteen, three of the four

ﬁrst place in, the western section of

‘the state league, but also invaded the

eastern half of the commonwealth and
carried back at its belt the Swarth-
more scalp and the state league cham-
pionship. Such a success marks the
high water mark in the ﬂoor game at

‘' Pitt and adds new laurels to the Uni-

versity’s rapidly-soaring athletic rep-
utation. ' _
In apprortioning the credit for this
achievement, equal shares should be
given to the members of the team
,which has brought such signal honors
3to the University, but the work of the
;coach should not be lost sight of. His
Eefforts for the last three months play-
led a very important part in producing
a winning team, although this fact
_may easily be overlooked amid the
general rejoicing. With the ‘loss _of
but two men on account of ineligibility
and graduation, the prospects are
bright for another successfvul season
in 1916 and an opportunity to secure
revenge for this year’s defeats.

INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATING.

 

The ‘triangular debate with Alle-
gheny and Wooster marked the open-
ing of the debating. season. The
success of the University debating
teams of last year have set a standard
of excellence. Following teams must
strain every nerve to uphold this
reputation. Although both teams were
defeated last week. the showing made
was fairly good, for ﬁve out of the
six ‘men were freshmen. On the
whole, prospects for the rest _of the
season are bright and debating is
steadily growing in importance. '

Intercollegiate debating practiced
by colleges of this section has several
phases of usefulness. Of course, the
prime importance is in the practice
afforded students taking part in the
work. Such activity also has its
effects in spreading the inﬂuence and
knowledge of the University over a
broader area. Among certain districts
as well, where the University is known
only by it's athletic successes, the
debaters sent out have an important
part to play in showing that at Pitt
the curriculum contains other subjects
besides football, basketball and base-
ball. 5

THE VARSITY LETTER CLUB.

 

The following letter has been sent
to about 200 men who have received
the varsity insignia at W. U. P. or
Pitt and whose addresses are known
by the General Alumni Secretary,
relative to the “Varsity Letter Club”
meeting at the Trees Gymnasivum
Friday night. ‘

To he men who have won their Varsity
Insignia at Pitt:

“For some time, we have been plan-
ning to organize a club known as
“The Varsity Letter Club,” to be
composed of men who have won the
varsity insignia in any branch of
ath1etics—major and minor sports.
The object is too bring the letter men
a little closer to the University and to
one another. Similar organizations
at Columbia, Michigan, Pen State and
otllier schools have been very success-
fu .

For the purpose of organizing such
a club We will have a gathering of
the letter men at the Trees Gym-
nasium, Friday evening, March 19th,
at 8 o’clock; and you, as a letter man,
are urged to attend. Advise me im-
mediately if you are 0. K.

The program will be STRICTLY
INFORMAL. Ratherithan a set
schedule of speeches and other un-
interesting things of that sort, we are
going to have a jolly good’ time into
which everyone present is expected to
enter with -the greatest enthusiasm.

We have the entire_ gymnasium at
our disposal that night from the roof
to the cellar and we can do as we
please. Following are- some of the
features:

A—At least one GOOD boxing botut
between the best amateur boxers of
Pittsburgh. We are going to depend

— on John Taylor, the local A. A. U.

Commissioner and Pitt’s swimming
coach to get us these men and he
knows who the best are.

B—A wrestling match between
members of the Pitt wrestling team.
“Jimmy” Jones, the football player,
will be one of these contestants.

C——A 100 yard swim to decide. Uni-
versity championship. All our crack
swimmers will be entered.

D-—An exhibition backstroke swim
by Buckland, of Pitt, the Middle
Atlantic Champion. *

E—Some good stories of athletics
of “Ye Olden Times,” by Walther
Riddle, Al Hamilton, Floyd Rose,
Bert Smyers-and others of the,“Old
Guard.” -  

F—-Formal organization of the club
and election of President, Vice
President and Secretary—Treasurer.

G——A nice lunch served by Trainer
Hunter Johnston and his assistant,
“Dory” Moore. “Dory” is the cook at
the football camp and track house.
There will be sandwiches, salad, ice
cream, cake, etc. 1 ,

The tax is $1.00 for graudates and
50 cents for undergraduate letter men.
We are -makingthe lower rate to the
undergraduates as we want them all
out, and don’t want possible low
ﬁnances to bother them. The expense
of this is considerable and with this
ﬂax we believe we can come near
making out ﬁnancially.

There will be no further expenses
connected with membership in the club
except a possible charge of 50 cents
or so for a Varsity Club Lapel Button.
We will have designs ready for ap-
proval that night. It is planned to
have a small button about 14 inch in

_diameter with a gold “P” on blue

enamel background. ‘Above the letter
“P” in a smei-circle will be the words
“Varsity” in small ‘type. . This is
something‘ you will be proud to wear
on your coat.

If you have any suggestions in this
connection, write me. ‘

Advise at once if you are coming
so we will know how many to make
reservation for. Let us have every
letter man located within a radius’ of
100 miles of Pittsburgh at this meet-

ing.”
K. ‘E. DAVIS,
Graduate Manager of Athletics,
General Alumni Secretary.

A big attendance is expected. All
the varsity athletic managers are
working to get their «undergraduate
letter men out, their slogan being
“One hundred per cent of the letter
men in school present.”

Several concerns are bidding on the
lapel buttons and something real nifty
will be decided on. The cost of these
pins will be small.

For the beneﬁt of the “Old Guard”
who won their letters many years ago,
we wish to say that they are ALL
WELCOME. Whether they competed
for W. U. P. or Pitt they are eligible,
the only requirement being that they
received the varsity insignia at some
time. These are the men we especial-
ly anxious to have in the club. We
want these older chaps to give the
club the proper balance.

cil, reception of reports of the vari-
ous committees, and the appointment
of the Nominating Committee to pre-
pare a ballot for the oﬂicers and mem-
bers of Council to be voted on at the

NOTES OF THE BEAVER

. COUNTY MEETING.

Orur old friend, Sam B. Wilson,
captain of the varsity baseball team
last year, attended the meeting. Sam
is practicing law with his father in
Beaver. Although he was originally
a W. & J . man and played on the ball
team there, Sam had lots of spirit for
Old Pitt when he attended our law
school. As a-‘captain --he was oneof
the best we ever had.

C. E. Terbush, Engr. '07, who is with
the American Bridge Company at
Ambridge, was present. “Terbie,” as
we knew him on Perrysville avenue,
is the father of two fine children.
Other American Bridge Company men
there were Karl Weiderkehr and J . W.
Hemphill, of the -class of 1914,
Engineering.

Senator Jos. .H. Thompson, ’05, was
right in his element as_ toastmaster,
although he‘ wasn’t aware that he was
to be thus honored until he came to
the Tamaqua Club that evening.

_..o....

Dr. B. C. Painter, '05, of New Brigh-
ton, is a Pitt enthusiast. Dr. Painter
was nominated for the presidency of
the club, but asked that his name be
withdrawn in favor of Dr. Allen. .

Dr. J. J. Allen, '91, who was elected
president of the club, says it pleases
him greatly to see how the University
has grown since the days when he
attended the, old West "Penn Medical
College on Brereton avenue. Dr. Allen
has a son, H. A., now in the pre-
medical course. Dr. Allen was the
oldest alumnus who attended. ,

_..o_._

Donald McCready, Phar. ’12, helped
get the Beaver Falls alumni out.

, S. D. Ehrman, Engr. ’04, of; Baden,
who was elected vice president of the
club was one of the best boosters we
had to help a crowd out. His election
to the vice presidency was the proper
move.

_...o__ ,

Dr. Mary I. Cornelius, Med. ’09, of
Beaver was the lone woman alumnus
at the meeting. She was called onby
Toast-master Thompson and responded
with some happy remarks.

. ——o—

Other alumni who attended the
meeting were Dr. Perry C. Smith,
Med. ’14; G. F. Bauers, Engr. '00; H.

VALE, OOHSENHIRT
'   FAREWELL, GRAHAM

The glorious close of the basketball
season, resulting in Pitt’s capture_ of
the state title, provides a ﬁtting
valedictory for the athletic career of
Ochsenhirt and Graham, two of the
University’s most noble exponents of
the ﬂoor game. Last Saturday's game
with Swarthmore marked the last ap-
pearance in a Varsity uniform of the
silver-tongued Teuton and the curly-
haired Scot; and there is no Pitt man
who is not sorry to see these’ two
reach the end of their four year's
service. V

Those who have seen Pitt’s ﬂoor
leader in his brightest moments can-
not escape the conviction that in
Ochsenhirt the .Varsity has been
blessed with a guard and a captain of
All-American calibre. Playing for the
last two years in the position of still
guard, “Butch”.has had small oppor-
tunity for brilliant individual display;
but no Pitt representative has ever

'surpassed the German in the ability

to turn apparent defeat into certain
victory, purely by reason of ﬁghting
spirit and determination. Always
Pitt's‘ best bet on theidefense,» with-
standing at times the attack of two
or more opponents, “Butch” has yet

been able to start Pitt rallies and cage

baskets at a time when they were
most needed.

Playing originally at center, Och-
senhirt has even this year been oc-
casionally shifted to the pivotal
position. Though perhaps the shortest
man who ever held down his job on a
college team, he was rarely out-
jumped, possessing an extraordinary
knack of taking the ball away from
his opponent on the toss.

The present year has been Graham’s
best. Though a letter man each of the
preceding three years, it was not until
this season that “Babe” really became
a regular. Handicapped by his dimin-
utive stature, Graham has made up in

. speed and skill what he lacked in size,

Q.

and has proven one of the most import-
ant cogs in Fli'nt’s championship
machine. On two or three occasions
in particular, as in the two contests
with W. & J., his game has been
simply unbeatable.

Pitt has good reason to be proud of
Allegheny’s two favorite sons. Even
the best of friends must part; but we
should gladly add another four years
to the term of these two gladiators.

   

GIRLS ARE ALSO
THERE IN A PINCH.

The deeds of the ancient Amazons
which have been lauded through the
centuries by all the generations of
men have been at last equaled if not
quite outdone in the achievements of
the Pitt girls’ basketball aggregation.
It will be remembered that in the ﬁrst

 three of the contests that the girls

 

cured. for this year. 4‘

plays resulted in victory in two incid-
ents, while they were beaten by a
narrow margin in the game with th
Fifth avenue delegation. '

The last aggregation to be sub-
mitted to the tender mercies of the
Pitt representatives was the girls of
the Allegheny High School. The game
was played with the accustomed vigor
and after the ﬁrst few moments of
play the game became a runaway with
the Pitt sextet far in the lead. As the
abduction progressed the ardent de-
fenders of the Blue and Gold had the
opposition hopelessly in the minority
and true to the expectations the game
was ﬁnally concluded with Pitt leading
by a score of 26-10.

games can be put into the won column
when the men on the teams act in
perfect harmony. One would hardly
recognize the team anymore.

 

Birds singing; trees budding, and
Hunter Johnson ﬁxing up the track
and the baseball ﬁeld all phophecy that
spring is almost here.

One can not hand the track team
so very much at that. Outside of the
shot put Pitt was so far behind that
it did not even make interesting watch-
ing. One night a week practice never
helped a man break any records.
Compulsory track work for Freshmen

. might help some.

 

A Did you see that large and enthus-
iastic mob of I students that saw the
team off‘ to win the championship of
the state? Neither did we.

Organized rooting and cheering
practice for a half an hour before a
debate night might explain why
Wooster has not lost a debate on its
home ﬂoor in the last ten years. When
you cannot get a meeting for a world
beater basketball team thingsgare in
pretty bad shape.

We have all heard what happens
when Greek meets Greek, but it will
be interesting to see what will happen
when the Greek-Manos meets the
Scotch whirlwind—Ray Huff. _ Manos
is back in school for next term, after
two years absence spent in reducing
the population in the Turkish
countries.

 

Saw a prep school basketball game
the other night. The enthusiasm
shown and the work of the cheer
leaders might be applied to our pres-
ent state of indifference to show us
what cheering really is.

C. I. T.’s publication with one of
the basketball players as sporting
editor has the happy faculty of for-
getting to put the Pitt-Tech basket-
ball game in the paper at all. I
wonder if it would have been diiferent
if they had beaten us?

 

Here’s to the Allegheny basketball
wonders, Captain “Butch” and “Babe”.
It will be a long time before we see
their likes again.

It-looks as though the annual track
meet between Pitt and W. & J . usually
held. in the spring will not be held this
year. The location for holding this
meet has been the cause of dropping
it.

BASEBALL TEAM
MAY MEET PIRATES.

That the Pitt baseball team will
make its preliminary debut in a pre-
season game with the Pirates is a
possibility, which seems to be laden
with more than common promise, ac-
cording to the announcement made
public by the management late today.
It has been the custom for the Penn
team to have its annual clash with the
Athletic delegation and Harvard is
wont to meet one of the Big Show ag-
gregations from Boston, but for Pitt
this is a distinct innovation. The
game will probably be sta ed at
Forbes ﬁeld so that the Pitt f ns will
be afforded the unique oportunity of
seeing Peck in action against the re-
doubtable Wagner or Lefty Langdon
pitted in a pitc_her’s duel with the
artful Cooper as hisopponent.

Coincident with the announcement
concerning the game with the Bucca-
neers came the intelligence that the
ﬁnal negotiations with the manage-
ment of the W. &-J. squad had been
brought to a conclusion, and as a re-
sult the Washingtonians are to come
to Pittsburgh on the 12th of June and
the Blue and Gold men will make the
excursion into Washington county on
the following Tuesday.

.An attempt is now being made by

 

the management to make the series
a’ three game‘ affair instead‘ of having

but two games, one of the contests ‘'

   

    

REINEOKE SIGNED
I FOR NEXT SEASON

When the State Meet had become
one of the events of the Athletic
history of the University, the contract
with Chas. Reinecke expired and left
the squad of earnest workers without
a leader. There was a sincere feeling
of _ regret among thepmen of the ag-
gregation over the failure to retain

this able mat man as their instructor,

for they well knew that a man of his
talent would soon be snatched up by
some of the other clubs of the vicinity
who were thinking of adding wrestl-
ing to their sports. This feeling was
entirely swept away today when it
was announced by the director of
athletics, Chas. S. Miller, that
Reinecke was to return to his old
position. ’

It is understood that there will be
a— practice under instruction one or
two days out of the week and that
the real work of preparation for the
coming season will be commenced with
the opening of the next fall term.
From the students of the Center
County College there comes a Warm
commendation for the morale of the
Pitt grapplers. ?With the material
that is now at hand and that whichis
sure‘ to come in next year there
should be a complete reversal of the
results of this season in the ﬁnal
achievments of the next.

To the team of next year will be
available“ the expert services of the
skilled Greek 145 pound man, Theos
Manos. Manos was in attendance at
the University and a promising mem-
ber of the wrestling team when the
call of the Fatherland came at the
openingof the Balkan War. He has
served his country through two wars
and is now back in the University to
complete his education. With Manos
in the 145 class there would be at least
one string of victories assured to Pitt.

FRESHMEN LOSE
TO CHARLEROI HIGH.

 

The Freshman team traveled to
Charleroi and‘ still in their slump they
lost to the high school boys. For some
reason orother the Freshies have lost
all semblance of team work that they
had in the beginning of the season.
Something is radically «wrong, or such
a change as has occurred in this team
the latter part of the season could
not of happended. Most of the team
broke into scoring but that is about
as far as they went. Clerihue starred
for the high school While Davis was
about the only one on the freshman
team that seemed to have the old
ambition.

The University of Michigan athletes
have placed the ban on the use of
tobacco at a mass meeting held in the
honor of the varsity teams. Also they
are working to abolish all betting on
games, drinking after victories and
the use of profane language by mem-
bers of the team. The movement was
entirely voluntary on the part of the
athletes and it is hoped that it will
spread to other universities.

Brickley, of Harvard, has been of-
fered $2,500 a season to coach the

coach of Princeton University football

the character of the success met with
has not, thus far, been made public.

The Pitt coach has no faith in the
indoor training of the squad more
than is absolutely necessary to keep
the men in good condition but with

the beginning of the coming month

the men will be called forth for seri-
ous out door work. It is fairly pos-
sible that several practice games may
beplayed with a graduate team to put
the men in the ﬁnest possible condi-
tion for the exhibition game with the
Pirates, ‘but this has not yet becomea

DUAL swmlmms
MEET WITH P. A. A.

Last Wednesday evening the swim-
ming aggregation of the University
invaded the waters of the Aquatic
Club and captured from the splash
representatives of that organization
a handsome trophy with the winning
of the relay race. The cup now re-
poses in the trophy case at the track
house in the company of the magniﬁ-
cent memory of the basketball team’s
single triumph. Pitt had men entered
in nearly all the other departments of
the meet, but in each notch were
compelled to, accept such _ heavy
handicaps that it was impossible for
them to win any further places. That
was more than compensated by in the
excellent work of the relay team.

Next Wednesday night the dual
meet between Pitt and the P. A. A.
will be held at the P.’ A. A. tank.
Sweet, Swope, Buckland, Ludwig, Fry,
Hillman and MacDiarmid have been
entered so far. The special national.
backstroke championship race for 200
yards will be held at this time. The
present holder of -the record, Hebner
of Chicago, will be entered as well as
Maisack of the local athletic associa-
tion and many more are expected to
enter from all part of the country.
Buckland is going good and it will
take a mighty good man to beat him.

 

PITT TRACK ‘TEAM
ACCOMPLISHES LITTLE.

 

Another Middle Atlantic Champion-
ship was. added to the number that is
already held by Pitt when last Satur-
day evening G. K. Fry captured the
medal for the hurling of the twelve
pound shot. It will be remembered
that a scant month ago Buckland
landed the golden trophy inthe back
stroke swim, so that Pitt is now pos-
sessed of two Middle Atlantic ‘Cham-
pions. '

Four of ﬁve other places were won
in this great meet by the Blue and
Gold representation, but no distinctive
showing was made beyond the success
of Fry. It has been suggested that
there is material enough in the Uni-
_versity to have built up a team which
would have made matters warm for
any competitors that night on the
scene, but that the failure of the men
to train in the proper manner deprived
the University of the services of some
execellent athletes. It is understood
that immediate steps will be taken to
remedy the defect so that by opening
of the outdoor‘ season the team put
on the track will be a far more eﬂcient
body than the one which represented
Pitt in the Week-end meet of last
week. '

LETTER BOX

Dear Editor":

Complying with your request, I
submit for what they are worth, my
ideas regarding the “Honor System.”
' The Honor System is ﬁne and the
finest thing about it is that its adop-

‘ tion can be forced upon the University

whether or not.

Each student desiring to do so can
adopt it for himself and be just as
honorab1e_ as he wants to be. If he
is not desirous of, or intending to
cheat, why should he vex himself
about someone else being watched to
prevent possible cheating?

-As a matter of fact we know that
in a number of individuals, there is a
certain percentage that are either
weak or crooked. ' V

But you say there are no crooks in
our school. Well, in the practical
world out of wliich they came and to
which they will return there are

.crooks enough to make it necessary

to have locked doors and night watch-
men. If I handle other peoples money
or business, I must furnish bond, all
these things are necessary at present.
How can you expect our students to
differ greatly in human qualities just
because they happen to be our stud-
ents for a time"?

The Honor System as proposed is
unfair to the honest student, it plays
into the hands of the crook and gives
him opportunity to make as good a
showing as the honest student. It
is even unfair to the crook as he takes
advantage of the loophole presented
and does not become as proﬁcient as
he otherwise would in order to pass
his examinations fairly. -

But again, you say students will
report it to the Student Organization
If so, then where does the

to all Pitt men and women of Beaver
county, by the officers of the “Beaver
County Club.” Alumni of other
counties can do well to follow the in-
structions of this letter.

To the Alumni and Students of

Beaver County: -
The Beaver County Pitt Club was_
formally organized at a meeting held
at Beaver Falls, Friday night, March
5th, the attendance being very en-
couraging and the affair in general
being most enjoyable to all who at-
tended. V

We are now ready to get down to
active work on behalf of the Univers-
ity, and wish to call the attention of
Beaver County Pitt men and women
to the following and urge them to co-
operate: .
This is appropriation year and it
is necessary that our University se-
cure a liberal amount of money from
the state in order that the work map-
ped out by the Chancellor and Board
of Trustees may not be retarded. It
will have a far reaching effect if every
alumnus and student of Pitt in our
county will write a letter to his or her
Senator and Representative calling
attention to the needs of the Univers-
ity and asking that they make every
effort to secure us a liberal appropri-
ation. The men to be thus addressed
are Senator J. H. Thompson, Beaver.
Falls, Pa. and Representatives J. R.
Gormley, Monaca, Pa. and J. K.
McClure, Darlington, Pa.

Enclosed pamphlet will give you the
desired data ‘to be incorporated in
your letter ‘to these men, as it tells
of the work of the University and its
cooperation with the Commonwealth.

Won’t you sit down and write a
letter at once to these men? The
same system is pursued by other in-
stitutions which receive state appro-
priations and is very effective.

Now that we have organized in
Beaver County we want to do some-
thing for Alma Mater. This the most
important thing to attend to NOW.
Will you do your share?

place? If all the students are honest
and honorable and believe each other
to be so. they should not be able to
see anything dishonorable in each
other, the very fact that provision is
made for such a contingency proves
lack of faith in the merit or efficiency
of the plan.

During an examination'a student’s
attention should be conﬁned strictly
to his paper and the whereabouts of
the professor or the doings of his
fellow students should not concern
him in the least. To divert on him
the supervision of‘ an examination
then implies‘: ﬁrst, improper or rather
inefficient supervision; second,
creature, a “tattler” or else the un-
willing abettro of any wrong doing
that may come under‘ his notice.

By all means have the Honor
System, but make it real and not a-
plan for which “Honor System” is but
an arbitrary, term.

The law is a terror to evil doers
only. There is only plenty of room
under the present system for the
exercise of all the honorable feelings
and intentions any student can have.”

O. M. Byers, Econ. ’O4, has just

sections of the globe where he, with
H. F. Clark, another Jeannette man,
installed glass making plants as
representatives of the American

esting information
Byer’s travels: 4

“Something like ﬁve years ago, it

will be remembered three Japanese,
Messrs. Mori, Kaizuma and Ona, came
here and “took lessons” in glass, mak-
ing at the plant of the American
Window Glass Company. Recently
Byers and Clark completed the con-
stvuction of a glass plant at Moji,
Japan, forvthe Asahi Glass Company,
the only big glass plant in the east.
Shortly after Mr. Byers left for
Europe he was joined by Miss Zella
Reuter to whom he was engaged and
the couple were married in London.
They had planned to wed in Germany,
but the marriage laws‘ insisted upon
a three month’s residence and Mr.
Byers hurried to England where a two
weeks’ residence for one party is
sufficient to ‘make a marriage legal.
The couple took their honeymoon
travelling through Germany and
journeyed through the beautiful river
Rhine district. ‘
Byers and Clark superintended the
construction ' of glass plants in Ger-
many, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Russia
and Japan. .

Mr. Byers spent several winters in
Russia and the summers in Portugal.
He says Germany is an ideal place to
live coming next to the United States
in his esteem. He declares the Ger-
man people are a sociable people and
good hosts. ’ I .

Japan is forging rapidly ahead in
modern manufacturing and invention,
say Mr. Byers. There is no evidence
of the “jingoism” so much talked of
in the country and high Japanese of-
ﬁcials made every effort to impress
upon the American that the Flowery
Kingdom’s people had no thought of
hostilities so far as the United States
is concerned.” ' "

PANTHER HAS BUT ONE
HOWL LEFT FOR YEAR

 

Gloom—-gobs of gloom, according to
the editorial manifesto, was the dis-

of the Pitt Panther, which went on
sale Monday morning. Exhausted with
its attack of the preceding issue on
the WEEKLY, the‘ Panther "made
mention of its distinguished contem-
porary not more than four times, one
of which comments bordered on the
favorable, and_ turned its broadsides
largely upon the Cap & Gown club,
and the embattled lords of the faculty.

In mechanical appearance the
Panther gainssteadily, andthe quality
of humor exhibited in the latest out-
burst sets a very high standard--in
spots. The cover_design is a well-
worked out personiﬁcation of the
spirit of gloom, in the shape of the
immi’r,ie_nt “F.” “Murmurings From
Afar 1S perhaps the cleverest colum,
out_of a possible total of one. Exams
and ‘the honor system, to give the
publication the appearance of iip-to-
datesness, receive due attention.
Orphic art is treated both from the
graphic. and the critical standpoint.
Exempliﬂications of the former are
scattered upon most of the sixteen
pages,'while the latter is the subject
of a poetic masterpiece on Cap‘ Night,
in imitation of the Modern Miss Stein.
