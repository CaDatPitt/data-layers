‘Work On Commons
Stone Setting Begins

Railroad Cars To Carry 4500 Tons Of Limestone; Project
To Be Finished, Along With Chapel, By Middle
Of June, Predicts Weber

Eighty new men--20 stone setters and 60 laborers and helpers—will be
on the University payroll starting today, when work begins on the setting

of 4,500 tons of Indiana limestone in

The stone will be brought in at the\‘/

rate of a carload ‘a day. Ab-out 140
railroad cars will be required to
transport the entire load.

Pr-oduction of the stone will ne-
cessitate the working of two lime-
stone millsnat full capacity during
the fall and winter.

Next June will see the completion
of the Commons Room and Heinz
Chapel, according to John Weber,
business manager of the University.
Funds am-ounting to $800,000 have
been guaranteed in the last few
months.

It is also expected that all ﬂ-oors
up to, and including, the eighthuwill
be ﬁnished by next June, and ﬂoors
14, 15, 16, 17 as well: Work on
other parts of the Cathedral will be
carried on as the need arises and
as more money pledges are received.

Room To Cost Half-Million

About $600,000 was raised by the
University in the campaign of 1934.
This sum was used mainly for the
purchase and installation of pipe,
wiring, switchboards and plumbing.
The newer contributions will go
toward work, the result of which is
more obvious.

The Commons Room will cost about
$500,000 when ﬁnished. Rooms
around the ﬁrst three ﬂoors will cost
an additional $300,000, which estimate
includes the cost of the nationality
seminar rooms, for which $170,000
has already been collected, mostly in
small subscriptions.

Commenting on the Cathedral,
Chancellor John G. Bowman says:
“At Pitt we are striving to give an
education that is the equal of what
could be provided by the wealthiest
parent for his children. We are striv-
ing to make the surroundings com-
patible with that endeavor.”

Bureau Indicates
Business Decline

Bank Debits, Trade Activity
Lower; Volume Rises

For the third consecutive week
business activity in the Pittsburgh
district has declined.

Releases by the Bureau of Business
Research show a drop in the business
index of 1.1, making the ﬁgure for
last week 95.3 per cent of normal.
This compares to the index of 96.4
for the preceding week and 59.8 a
year ago.

Although the actual volume of busi-
ness in the district has increased
since the latter part of August, the
gain is less than that usually recorded
after the close of the summer varia-
tion season.

The Bureau’s adjusted index of
iron and steel production in the dis-
trict rose to 105.7 per cent of normal
from 104.9 per cent in the preceding
week. Partly responsible for this rise
was the increase of the steel ingot
production and the enlistment of an
additional blast furnace. At present
34 out of the district's 53 furnaces
are now active.

In the four weeks ending Septem-
ber 26 department store sales were
21 per cent higher than in the cor-
responding weeks of 1935.

Welcoming Party [
For Second Year
Women Planned

Apples, Nuts To Be Vogue
At Heinz House Social

Bobbing for apples, searching for
peanuts and “going to Jerusalem”
will be only a few of the activities
of the sophomore women at their wel-
come party today in Heinz Hou-se.
With the cabinet members and Miss
Jane Shurmer, class sponsor, as host-
esses, the class of 1939 will play from
3 to 5 o’clock.

The “nut” party is the ﬁrst social
aﬁ'air sponsored by the sophomore
class and is open to all sophomore
women. Prizes are oﬂ"ered to the
ones who ﬁnd the most peanuts or
win other games planned by the pro-
gram committee.

With Madame Guess A. Ginny as
fortune teller, the party-goers will be
able to ﬁnd out the safety of con-
tinuing that math course.

EGG PUZZLE

Biology Dept. Astounded
By Lehman Easter Egg

* III *

By Paula Levinson #:-

The Biology department is baffled
by an egg. Members of this depart-
ment admit that they can no-t ﬁgure
out the egg, a special kind, belonging
to Milton Lehman, C39.

Originally a plain white hen’s egg,
it was hard-boiled, painted with a
caricature and given to Mr. Lehman
as an Easter egg last Easter. He
kept it as a souvenir until last week.
when he accidentally dropped it.
After removing the cracked shell, he
discoverecl that the white was com-
pletely gone and that the yolk had
hardened until it looked as though it
had a thin ﬁlm of amber around it.

Beneath this ﬁlm the egg is still
rather soft and waxy. The ﬁlm is
brittle and transparent. When hit it
has a slightly metallic sound.

The part nearest the point at which
there is air in the egg, is covered with
a heavier layer of this substance
that no one from the lowest graduate
assistant to the highest professor can
name. If anyone can explain this
phenomena, the entire Biology de-
partment would be glad to hear his

explanation.

Novel Hats
To Feature

Coed Prom

Bob Duncan’s Orchestra,
Floor Show, Stag Line,
Will Be Highlights

Two problems face the University
women attending the annual Coed
Prom, Wednesday evening from 7 to
9:30 o’clock, at the University Club.
Upperclasswomen must ﬁnd a peace-
able way of borrowing their brothers’
fathers’ cast-oﬂ’ summer ﬂannels, and
freshman women must think of clever
ways of making blue and gold crepe
paper into garden hats.

The garden hats are in keeping
with the summer formals worn by
the freshman women who will be es-
corted by upperclass girls. Prizes
for the best hats will be awarded
after the grand march, when fresh-
man women pass the reviewing stand
where the judges will be seated.

Dancing to the tunes of Bob Dun-
can’s orchestra, the feminine escorts
will arange partners for their dates.

Midway in the festivities, a ﬂoor
show will take the spotlight, with
dancers and vocalists entertaining.
Mary Jo Kunkle, C37; June Greene,
C38, and Beverly Childress, C38, will
be among the entertainers. Both
Dorothy Zimmerman, C37, and Mar-
ian Werner, G, will sing.

Board members of WAA, the or-
ganization sponsoring the prom, will
be identiﬁed by tags.

No upperclass women will be ad-
mitted without a freshman date, for
the stag line will consist only of men-
tors and board members, who will be
identified at the door.

Paper Of Former Downtown Students To Be Integrated
With Campus Publication In Order To Further
Close Relationship Between Two Groups

By Mel

Rogow

With today’s issue of the Pitt News, the University’s Evening
Division moves a step closer to the campus.

On ten Mondays during this school year, the Pitt News will
give over 60 inches-of page four to the Evening Session News,
successor to the Downtowner, oﬂicial student paper of the Evening

Division.

This is in accordance with the recent transfer of the

Division from a downtown office building to the Cathedral.

Tufts Will Speak
To Weekly Forum
On Local Housing

‘How'The Other Half Lives’
To Be Address By Head
Of Housing Group

“How the Other Half Lives” will
be the title of a talk by Joseph P.
Tufts, head of the Pittsburgh Hous-
ing Association, at the weekly meet-
ing of Inquiry Forum today at 12:30
o’clock in Room 107, Alumni Hall.

Mr. Tufts will review many of the
aspects of the current housing sit-
uation. He will discuss the problems
of the present housing shortage, give
a survey of the gains made in the
general improvement of housing
since the last serious shortage in
1921, and outline the prospects for
improvement during the next ﬁve
years.

A review of present building trends
in Pittsburgh will also be included in
Mr. Tufts’ address. His comments
on this point will include a listing of
the present difﬁculties and sugges-
tions for overcoming them. He will
also draw on national statistics, and
make comparisons between them and
the conditions in Pittsburgh.

Mr. Tufts is a recent addition to
the faculty of the University. He
teaches a course called the “Social
Aspects of Housing,” in t-he depart-
ment of social work. He has worked
for several years, pr-omoting improve-
ment of housing conditions in Alle-
gheny County.

Hartson Speaks
To Uil Seminar

Pittsburgh Gas Supply Sure
For Times Of Shortage,
Says Company Head

D. P. Hartson, operating manager
of the Equitable Gas Company, and
member of the advisory committee of
the department of oil and gas, spoke
to the regular weekly seminar of the
oil and gas department last Thursday.

The petroleum reﬁners, Whose
speaker was mable to appear, joined
the oil and gas students.

Mr. Hartson pointed out how
Pittsburgh is connected with the vast
system of gas lines which covers the
country. This connection guarantees
that Pittsburgh’s supply will be con-
stant if anything should happen to
the West Virginia and Kentucky gas
ﬁelds which now supply our needs.

The students were also introduced
to the history, development, and some
of the problems of the Equitable Gas
Company. In addition, the Univer-
sity and its students’ relationship
with the gas industry was indicated.

\/

J. Stewart Hunter, instructor in
English, and faculty advisor to the
Downtowner last year, will continue
in the same capacity this year. He
is being assisted by a partially formed
Editorial Board including W. Bruce
Hosack, Walter Heim, Harold Hosack,
Edward Mellinger and Virginia
Means.

Board Partially Formed

The new setup will insure a greater
distribution of The Pitt News, as
2,000 additional copies will be printed
for the late afternoon, evening and
Saturday students. A glance at page
four will show that the usual Pitt
News style is being used in the col-
umns of The Evening Session News.

In October, 1927, the ﬁrst issue of
an independent Evening Division
paper appeared, under the name
of Pitt Rivets, It was a three col-
umn paper under the editorship of
David L. Mitchell. Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, present dean of men, was
faculty advisor. The last issue of the
paper, in June, 1929, had but two
columns.

Name Changed

In October, 1929, the name Pitt
Rivets was changed to Pitt Down-
towner, with an accompanying edi-
torial explaining that the new name
was more suited to the location of
the school and could “be considered
peculiar to ourselves.” It was a two
column paper, under the editorship
of Fred C. Wilharm and under the
advisorship of Dr. John G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the University, Dr.
Lanfear, and William S. Maulsby,
former professor of journalism at
the University.

The last issue of the paper, pub-
lished in February, 1936, under the
faculty advisorship of Mr. Hunter,
with an editorial board composed of
11 evening division students, had
four columns.

J. Lloyd Mahony, director of the
Evening Division, seemed pleased with
the latest change of the name and
location of the evening session pub-
lication. He said, “I think that the
combination paper will be advantage-
ous in that the regular students will
learn of the Evening Division activi-
ties, and the evening school students
will feel more a part of the Univer-
stiv.”

Belfour Will Address

Conference At Eric

C. Stanton Belfour, assistant di-
rector of the Extension Division, will
go to Erie October 16 to speak at
the annual conference of music ed-
ucators of Western Pennsylvania.
His subject will be “The Implications
of Music Contests.”

Mr. Belfour is the executive sec-
retary of the Pennsylvania Forensic
and Music League, a state-wide or-
ganization for music and speech ac-
tivities.

The League is under the supervi-
sion of the Extension Division. Its
tenth anniversary will be celebrated
next April with a state contest at
Altoona.

On Into The Night

TODAY, evening and day students join hands for the ﬁrst
-time. Perhaps columns of linotype slugs seem a blt cold and

distant. Yet there is every chance that those raised letters racing

through the rotary press will fold into a stack of papers that will
some day mean something more than common material for the re-
spective wastebaskets at the end of the day;

It is ﬁtting that The News, medium for the prospective join-
ing of the groups, express ﬁrst a sincere and hearty welcome to
the students of the night. Their desire to learn is unquestioned.
This, alone, is enough for a strong tie between the regular and eve-
ning sessions.

The two groups have much in common. Now they will have
even more. Page four with an Evening Sessions Division ﬂaghead
will be read once each month by the day students of this Uni-
versity. At least once each month, the students of the later hours
will be more acutely interested in what the earlier students are
thinking, planning, doing. They belong. We welcome them.

Paging Barney Oldfield

A CCORDING to latest reports, two hundred and ﬁfty students
petitioned for positions in the SFA-sponsored student cheer-
ing block. This was the report at the close of the ﬁrst day regis-
tration. It was a gesture, but not a very strong one. Some eight
hundred are needed to make the venture a success. Two hundred
and ﬁfty is a very small proportion of the thousands who are
eligible to participate.

SFA needs more applicants. The University needs them. Fifty
footballers, whose feats each Saturday make coast-to-coast news,
drive every day through all sorts of obstacles to make that news.
One hundred and twenty members of the ROTC band drill equally
long to snap through their “squads right” and “letter spelling”
maneuvers during a brief ten-minute period between halfs. Yet
when the student government sends out a call for recruits to add
the last touch of color that will make this University completely
nationally-prominent in the football world, the students are slow
to respond.

We know they will respond. Yet mid-season is already ap-
proaching, and to make the undertaking a success there is much
that must be done in a relatively short period of time. Today, the
second day of call, should see the number pass the eight hundred
mark with several hundred to spare.

I
We re Off!

THE dance season is now under way, and according to reports
from Friday's events in the Grotto ballroom the dance season
was not the only thing that was “under way” at the Kick-Off
event, what with Greeks, engineers, and others bringing back
memories of the old ﬂying wedge when that football sailed into

the crowd of ﬁrst—nighters.

Student Returns From France

Universities Characterized
By Short Registration,
TWo—Dollar Tuition

By William Colker

Anthony Henrici, graduate student
ll. languages at the University, is glad
to get back after an 11-month stay
in France at the University of Bor-
deaux. .

Henrici found the French philos-
ophy one of extreme simplicity. “The
people,” he said, “are inclined to
make the most out of a little.”

In keeping with this philosophy,
meals are prepared very simply. But-
ter is served only as a hors d’oeuvre;
but bread is served in large quanti-
ties, and wine is an essential part of
the meal. Vegetables are never
served with the main dish. Pie is
unknown. “Their French fried po-
tatoes,” Henrici stated, “are terrible.”

Chaperones Required

The French madamoiselle, although
she has more freedom than before
the war, is still a restricted individual.
If monsieur (boy friend) calls on his
one and only for a theater date, he
ﬁnds that he not only must foot the
bill for her, but also for her chap-
erone (usually a member of her fam-
ily), who somewhat hampers hand-
holding in the darkened theater. The
chaperone continues to drag along
until the couple have become engaged.

“The French university,” Henrici
explained, “is merely a training school
for passing of civil service examina-
tions.” It takes but two minutes to
register in a university, and the tui-
tion amounts to approximately two
dollars and ten cents a semester. The

Practicing Beethoven sonatas and
hammering out Irving Berlin hits is
a good investment when one is young,

if the recent experiences of 11 Uni-
versity students mean anything. For
these men, by virtue of their musical
ability earned themselves trips to and
.from Europe last summer on the big
ocean liners.

Five freshman instrumentalists,
Andrew Cox, William Rock, Ralph
Bergemann, Jack McGuirk, and Wal-
ter Koegler, were the first of the or-
chestras to leave, boarding the Cale-
donia in New York on July 11 and
arriving at Glasgow, Scotland, on
July 20. The squealing of bagpipes
and seasickness do not go well to-
gether, they said. After making a
short tour of England, the orchestra
left for home on the S. S. California,
arriving in New York on August 9.

The next orchestra to leave was
headed by Jack Lally, BA38. Ac-
companying Lally were Fran Birnley,
BA38, Robert Cook, C38, and two
non-students, Clark Sons and Vincent
McConaughy. The unit left for Eng-
land on the S. S. Transylvania the

classes consist mainly of lectures,
and whether or not you show up for
class, the professor expounds his
theories and doctrines.

At the end of the semester, he
reaches the crowning achievement of
the year. He gives an examination.

What About Sweet Pickles?

At the French university, there is
no organized student life. Social
life consists mainly of friendships ac-
quired in the classroom. There is no
extra-curricular activity, and frater-
nities are unknown.

-The layout of the French city looks
like a Cecil B. DeMille creation for
a movie set. The houses, which are
made of uncomfortable grey stone,
and which have no porches, protrude
on to the street. There are no side-
walks, and the people amble along in
the streets at a leisurely pace. The
main traffic hazard for pedestrians is
bicycles, which the majority of the
people ride.

There are no billboards, but pos-
ters are pasted on walls throughout
the city. Pointed questions are asked
the political leaders in these posters
by minority groups, something to the
effect: “Monsieur Blum, what do you
intend to do about the price of sweet
pickles?” or, “Why hasn’t the budget
been balanced?”

In America, liquor must be bought
at government licensed stores, and
tobacco may be purchased anywhere.
In France, the situation is reversed.
Liquor may be obtained anywhere,
and tobacco must be bought only at
stores speciﬁed by the government.
Their tobacco is of a very harsh, in-
ferior grade. American cigarettes in

Visited By Three Student Orchestras On

After visiting Stratford-on-Avon, Ox-
ford University, Birmingham, Belfast,
and London, the orchestra sailed Sep-
tember 8 on the Samaria, arriving in

Pittsburgh just in time to hit the an-
nual bugaboo of registration.

All of the orchestras were required
to work approximately threc hours
per day, playing dance and dinner
music. All players agreed that for
the opportunity to visit Shakespeare’s
birthplace, get lost in London streets,
date English girls, and get two free
rides, the work was worth it

The Frenchman, when he enter-

to his home, but takes them to a cafe.
There, for the price of a cup of cof-
fee, checkers, chess, newspapers, and
cards are distributed among the
guests. You may sit all night over a
cup of coffee. Some of the larger
cafes have an orchestra and a ﬂoor
show, but the entertainment is poor,
and the prices exhorbitant.

The American movies have had an
inﬂuence on the French language.
Such words as business man, week-
end, nurse, and gangster, have come
into common usage. The most Amer-
ican things in France are cafeterias,
which have just been introduced in
the ﬁve and ten cent stores.

It’s Getting

  

 
 

 

Hot Out

Near Columbus Now!

While Panthers Paw Over

Mountaineers, Ohio State

Turns On Heat To Swamp New York U. Eleven;
Stage Set For Saturday’s ‘Grid Classic’

Jock Suther1and’s Pitt Panthers pawed roughly over a feud-
less clan of Mountaineers early Saturday afternoon, but towards
the later stages of play they even lost interest in this and seemed
to be peering slyly past the Stadium walls, even past the Allegheny
foothills, and out into the ﬂat, “frying-pan” country of Ohio.

What they saw near the Beelzebubian territory of Columbus
was enough to make them realize that even the Good Doctor’s

spring training and pre-season as—‘~‘/T

bestos formulas would get their
toughest test one week hence.

For Jumpin’ Joe Williams, “Tippy”
Dye and Company took just 30 sec-
onds of play to start their 60—O
rout of a strange, shrinking Violet
outﬁt from New York, before a rec-
ord-opening crowd of 72,000. In the
Stadium, a McDonald—led Pitts-
burgh squad, after a long and sluggish
ﬁrst quarter, ﬁnally opened" up with
both barrels, led by Leo Malarkey
and Tony Matisi at the controls, to
send back the Martin-Coy represen-
tatives to “Snake” country, nursing
a sound 34-0 trouncing.

Malarkey Sparkles

Where Hub Randour left off last
fall, Leo Malarkey picked up the Mc-
Donald, Pa., torch, and held it high
over the Stadium turf during the
more important portions of the after-
noon.

After a scoreless first quarter,
Sutherland juggled the starting line-
up, substituting with Delich, Raskow-
ski, Lezouski, Hensley, Malarkey,
Michelosen and Stebbins. The new
combination showed a new punch im-
mediately, paced by Stebbins and
Malarkey at halfs.

Alternating, these two combined to
shove over the ﬁrst score, Malarkey
hurtling the last barrier with several
Mountaineers clutching madly at
Malarkeyless air. Stebbins opened
that ﬁrst drive with a dandy 36-yard
jaunt around left end, crossing up
the right over-balanced West Virginia
secondary. Patrick converted with
La Rue holding the ball.

Hoffman Pulls One In

Soon after this play, Hoffman
ﬁnally managed to get hold of a nice
pass from La Rue, which, followed
by a tricky piece of broken-ﬁeld run-
ning, resulted in the second score
of the afternoon. Patrick again
made good the extra point.

Along about this time Mr. Kelly
Moan opened the vaunted West Vir-
ginia passing attack, but as through-
out the 60 minutes of play, Pitt’s
secondary stuck too close on the trail
of Mountaineer receivers.

Only once was the Pitt secondary
caught napping, and then only a bril-
liant shoestring catch by Babe Bar-
na, husky left end, and a question-
able ruling on his after-pass fumble,
gave Trusty Ta1lman’s lads their only
sojourn into threatening territory.

Malarkey scored the most sensa—'
tional dash of the game early in the
third period with a beautifully-paced
80-yard jaunt. Tony Matisi, who
showed shades of the real Malarkey
with his ball—hawking tactics through-
out the game, was the outstanding
lineman on the ﬁeld. He not only
spent much of his time in the Tall-
man back ﬁeld, but followed the ball
closely on punts, passes-——in fact, he
was Tony-on-the-spot during the en-
tire session.

On To Ohio State

Lezouski and Raskowski, tough
Sophomore guards, continued where
they left off in the Ohio Wesleyan
game with their smack-’em-down
play. Goldberg, running the ball
only ﬁve times with no remarkable re-
sults, showed that he could block on
several occasions. Patrick’s spot-
kicking indicates that Pitt should
have few worries in the punting de-
partment.

And now, on to Columbus! Next
Saturday’s “frying-pan” test for two
of the country’s leading contenders
for national honors approaches.

Football Dopester
Gets .600 Average

In his ﬁrst appearance at the
plate as The News’ football dope-
ster, “General” Ulysses S. Grant,
72-year-old night watchman of the
Cathedral, batted the pigskin for
a starting average of .600.

“U. S.”, who “doesn’t know a
thing about the football game,”
had 12 right out of his 20 predic-
tions. He belted out the proper
selections in the Pitt—West Vir-
ginia clash and the Tech—N~otre
Dame affair in South Bend, which
gave him a perfect rating for‘ the
local district.

It was when the site of the
games changed to the South, the
Mid—west, and the Far-west, that
the General put his fodder in the
wrong cannons. Tulane, Louisi-
ana, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt
aimed the wrong way in the
South. The West had Washing-
to-n State and Marquette doing
dirt to our General. In the only
o+‘1er wrong prediction, Mr. Grant
had West Virginia Wesleyan tag-
ged to dot Davis-Elkins, but the
latter .lid all the dotting that was
done in that game.

“General” Grant will have more
of his pre-game prediction-s later
this week on the country’s big 1
games Saturday. We have a feel- '
ing Mr. Grant is going to disagree
with O. O. McIntyre, the column-
ist, and take the Panthers to (sink .
Ohio State at Columbus. ‘ ~

Panther Foes Need
Adding Machines

Opponents Take Leadership
In ‘Touchdown Parade’

Power, Power, Power! With crisp,

machine-like shots, Pitt’s future op-
ponents dropped their past week-end

foes with thuds that were heard the
country-round.
>11 >l< >l<
When Pitt fans stopped to add up
the totals of four 1936 opponents’

scores, they were alarmed to ﬁnd the
amazing average of better than 51

points for each of the four teams.

Two of the four teams battered
about by future opponents of the
Panthers have consistently been in
the top-bracket. The other two were
far from the “push-over” class.

Perhaps the most startling out-
come was the riddling of a New York
University machine by the devastat-
ing Ohio State hurricane. Francis
Schmi-dt’s boys, who are scheduled
for some sort of engagement Sat-
urday with the Sutherland men,
reached an even 60 before the ﬁnal
blast was sounded.

Equally impressive was Nebraska’s
34-0 sweep over a plucky Iowa State
eleven. The Fordham Ram saw red
against Franklin and Marshall, pil-
ing up the high count for the after-
Penn State lost
Hugo Bezdek over the week-end, but
certainly showed that this meant
nothing so far as the Muhlenburg
test was concerned, passing with a
high grade of 45-0.

Irish Top Tartans

Outside of the ‘big-money” class,
yet holding a much more important
ranking when net totals are to be
summed up, was the South Bend af-
fair. Tech l-ost, as predicted, but
only after giving the Irish plenty to

think about during intermission pe-

Panther Natators
Begin Workouts
This Afternoon

Five Veteran ‘Swimmers
Return This Season;
Frosh Promising

This afternoon C-oach Pat Corr’s
natators will churn through the
waters of Trees Gym Pool in the
initial practice session of the season.
Altho-ugh informal practice has been
observed all week, an invitati-on has
been extended by Coach Corr to all
freshmen and upper class candidates
to report for practice in the pool
today.

Corr Banks On Levine

Having ﬁve lettermen from last
year’s team returning, prospects for
a ‘winning outﬁt are not remote.
Those lettermen remaining from last
year’s squad are T-om Locke, Red
McQuillan, Tom Anderson, John
Stiran-ka and Harry Geyer. Locke is
a more than fair distance man, An-
derson is a breaststroker; Stiranka’s
specialty is the backstroke, and Mc-
Quillan and Geyer are divers. Mc-
Quillan was intercollegiate diving
champion tw-o years ago and runner-
up last year. In Jim Lavine, Corr
expects to ﬁnd a winning distance
man this year although he did not
make a varsity letter last year.

From last year's freshman team
Walt Nowotny, who swims a little of
everything, is a promising candidate
for the varsity. A team-mate of
Nowotny’s last year, Bernie Lelake,
formerly held the AMA backstroke
championship and should win a berth
on the varsity squad this year with-
out much trouble.

A Quartette Of Stars

Among the freshmen entering this
year are four boys who can do more
in the water than just keep them-
selves aﬂoat. When put together
they form a winning relay combina-
tion, having won fame in that role
for the Irene Kaufmann Association.
Al Beacon, a member of this four, is
a backstroker who not only holds the
AMA championship for this event,
but also the Pitt National Interscho-
lastic record. The other three con-
sist of the two Ledersteine brothers,
Milt and Hym, Who swim the free-
style and backstroke, and Al Slabo-
dian, also a free-style and back-
stroke artist.

Last year the team lost only two
meets, dropping one to the Army and
the other to Franklin & Marshall. This
year these two schools will again be
met along with Delaware, Tech, Man-
hattan, Slippery R-ock and others not
yet determined Army and F&M are
expected again to offer the stiffest

competition.

Frosh 

Dominate Meet

Events Open To All Novices
In Track Competition

Returns on the desk of Carl Olson,
varsity track coach, show that the
signed entry blanks for the ﬁfth an-
nual University Track and Field
meet, to be held October 14 and 15 at
the Stadium, give a great partiality
to the freshmen.

Fro-m this show of entries, it would
seem that freshmen are the only ones
inclined to believe they are novices.
Mr. Olson hastens to assert, that while
most of the undiscovered track talent
is hiding around behind those green
buttons, the meet is open to every-
one, upperclassmen included. Of
course, the stipulation that letter win-
ners are ineligible still holds good.

Practice sessions, which have been
going on since the meet was an-
nounced, has brought out quite a bit
of potentialities among the freshman
entrants. Al Ferrara has shown up
well in his practice jaunts over the
100, 220 and 440—yard dash grounds.
There are plenty of good distance
men running around from the class
of 1940. Among them are Joe Krus-
tufek, Paul Clifford, Frank Chatham
and Milt Golden.

Others who have already entered
include Bob Burns in the dashes,
John O’Neal in the weight events,
and Andy Mihok in the sprints.

The Evening Session News

THE EVENING SESSION NEWS, written and edited by a

special editorial board, makes its debut in this issue as the
successor to and heir of the PITT DOWNTOWNER. Working
jointly, rather than as an organized staff, the board has produced
this section of THE PITT NEWS. Subsequent issues will appear
on October 26, November 16, December 7, February 15, March 8,
April 12, and April 26.

The EVENING SESSION NEWS is not a closed corpora-
tion. Any evening student with writing ability, or, for that mat-
ter, anyone interested in testing his ability, is welcome to try out
for a position on the paper.

Interest, not experience, is really the only qualiﬁcation. Leave
your name at the office and a staff member will get in touch
with you.

Open House Week

IN THE days when the evening school consisted of a score or
so of classes and a few hundred students, the business of get-
ting acquainted was taken for granted. The process started on
registration evenings and by the third week of classes practically
everyone was on a ﬁrst-name speaking basis.

Recently, ready acquaintanceship among students and faculty
has not developed so readily. With almost three hundred differ-
ent classes and a student body of some twenty-ﬁve hundred the
problem of dissipating formalities and becoming acquainted even
to the point of an intermission conversation with a fellow class-
mate is difficult. This difficulty gave rise to the institution of
Open House Week.

Coming at the very beginning of each new school year, the
week of open house does much toward making every one feel at
home and among friends. Many a lasting friendship has developed
out of a casual “over-the-coffee-cup” remark or from a handshake
around a circle.

A week set apart for stimulating acquaintanceship, however,
can only provide a convenient setting. It remains for the student
or faculty member himself to use the occasion “to speak and to
be spoken to.” '

Federal Educator Physics C0”0q“i“m

Addresses Faculty

Dr. David Ingliss, assistant profes-
sor of physics, will speak at the week-
ly physics colloquium next Wednesday

Evening Students’ Chances at 9:30 o'clock.

Discussed, Explained

Dr. Clarence S. Marsh, Associate
Director of the American Council
on Edu-cation, Washington, D. C., for-
merly Dean of the Evening Session
of the University of Buffalo, was the
speaker at a'luncheon for the evening
faculty in the Faculty Club on Thurs-
day noon, October 1.

“A student, when he registers for
an evening class,” Dr. Marsh said,
“has a right to expect a full admin-
istrative staff to perform all of the
functions which his university rela-
tionship demands: a teacher wh-o is
the master of his subject and who
knows and practices the art of teach-
ing, and the opportunity of meeting
and learning to know other students
who share his ideals and objectives.”
He drew upon his wealth of personal
experience in evening school teach-
ing to illustrate both effective and
poor teaching techniques.

E.S.A. Swimming Party
Scheduled For Oct. 23

An innovation in the social life
of the evening students will receive
its ﬁrst tryout on Friday, October 23,
at 8 o’clock, when E. S. A. will hold
the first of a series of swim parties
at Trees Gym.

Tickets are moderately priced at
25 cents apiece. Holders will be en-
titled to two hours of good swim-
ming. Toe dabblers, sun-tanners and
plain lookers-on will be welcome and
will ﬁnd, the E. S. A. promises, a
creditable expanse of beach and
bleachers at the gym. (The pun is
unintentional.)

Tickets may be obtained at the
office of the Executive Committee.

Varied Programs Of Events
To Usher In The New
Administration

As President of the Evening Stu-
dents’ Association, I extend a hearty
welcome to the students of the late
afternoon, evening, and Saturday

classes. By virtue cf your registra-
tion you have all
automatically be-
come members of
the Association. It
is my hope that
you will wish to
take an active part
in its affairs.

One of the pri-
mary purposes of
the Association is
to advance the so-
cial interests of its
members. To this
end the Executive
Committee has planned a program of
social events which will, I hope, be of
interest to every student in the Eve-
ning Session. Elsewhere in this issue
a list of those events appears.

On behalf of the Executive Com-
mittee let me extend a warm invita-
tion to every student of the Evening
Session to meet his fellow students in
the ESA functions and to participate
in the fellowship that has for many
years characterized student life in the
evening sessions of the University.

Cordially yours,
Walter Heim.

popular of the E. S. A. events. Ac-
cording to the statistics compiled by
the alert Budget Committee of last
year’s executive board, an astonish-
ing total of 2,445 sli-ces of cake, 64

and 20 pounds of sugar were con-
sumed by the student body during‘
the week.

Social Events

The second edition of the Directory
of Student Activities will make its
appearance on October 12 and will
be distributed among the student
body during open house Week.

The Directory, ﬁrst published at
the opening of school last year, will
contain a list of the organizations
and activities of the Evening Ses-
sion, a calendar of events for the
year, and a summary statement con-
cerning each club or fraternity an-
swering questions of membership, the
eligibility of candidates for member-
ship, dues, and awards.

The little green book, which this
year will be approximately ﬁfteen
pages in length, contains a wealth
of detailed information. It will
serve as a valuable aid to fraternity
officers and committee chairmen in
planning their several events. The
calendar will be of particular ser-
vice in eliminating conﬂicting dates.
Programs which have not been an-
nounced may be scheduled for eve-
nings that promise no competition.

New students, interested in frater-
nity life as it is lived by late after-
noon, evening, and Saturday students
will ﬁnd the book useful as an index
of the kind and quantity of extra-
curricular activities which the eve-
ning session affords.

The Directory is published by the
Evening Students’ Association from
materials furnished by the various
organizations. The booklet Will list
this year thirteen clubs and fraterni-
ties and eighty—eight events.
