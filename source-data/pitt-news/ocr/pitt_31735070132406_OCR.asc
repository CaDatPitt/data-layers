For the second year in" a row, the
streets of Pittsburgh were ranked the
'1 0th safest in the nation, according to a
recent report released by the Pittsburgh
Bureau of Police.

Statistics from the nation’s 50
largest cities were compiled and com-
pared to ﬁnd their national standings.

' Coming in at number one in the stand-

ings was San Jose, California.

Also above Pittsburgh, on the list
was New York, at" number two, and
Philadelphia, at seven. _

The number of serious crimes
reported to law enforcement in 2002
decreased this year by 0.2 percent in

Pitt student returns after serving tourof duty in Iraq, Kuwait

NICK KEPPLER
* ' Staff Writer

“Surreal” that’s how Col.
John Schneider described returning
to Pittsburgh after eight months of
duty in Kuwait and Iraq.

Schneider, whose senior year at
Pitt was interrupted when he was
called to active duty, returned to his
home in Pittsburgh on the morning
of Sept. 17.

_ “A week ago, there were sand-
storms in my eyes and I was in .110
degree J weather,” Schneider

recalled. ‘?Now I amt-here with

friends, green trees, running water.
It’s very surreal.” _

When Schneider, a marine
reservist, left for a weekend drill in
January, he “had a feeling” a call to
duty was coming soon. _

That weekend, a military offi-
cial called his home to tell his fam-

  
 

ily that he had indeed been activat-
ed. -
Schneider arrived in Kuwait on
Feb. 12, and five weeks later,
President George W. Bush formally
declared war on Iraq.

"Schneider’s unit served as mili-

tary police. In front of him were the
“gru_nt_s” — the front line soldiers
 _and a medical convoy. _

His unit was responsible for
providing security for those ahead
of. -them and transferring Enemy
Prisoners of War to British intelli-
gent units.

According to Schneider, his
unit’s biggest fearwas the Iraqi
regime’s reported chemical
weapons. _ '

“That was always hanging over
our heads,” he said. ._

Though they never actually
faced chemical weapons, the- men in
Schneider’s unit were often caught

    
  

     
   

in heavy gunfire. At one point, they
faced mortar fire for more than four
hours. , A
‘Schneider said the people of
Iraq were “ecstatic” when they saw
coalition troops.

“There was a lot of celebra-

tion,” he said. “Eyery clay was like

being in a parade.”
One encounter
touched Schneider.
“T h_is old woman came up to me
and said, ‘Thank you for giving us
freedom.’ It felt really good,” he
added. ~ . .
Schneider also had an encounter
with a protest mob.
q“The translator told us they
were. shouting ‘U.S. get out.’ I was
kind of pissed off,” he said. “But
then I realized that they were
protesting against what is now their
government. They were ableto do
this because of us. It put things in

   

particularly,

perspective.” -'
After the fall of Baghdad,

Schneider’s unit oversaw_ the trans-

portation _of oil that Kuwait had

donated to try to aid in the restora-
tion of Iraq. During this time, the
marines in his unit began to com-

plain about. their situation, he

added.

“On the missions, no one com-
plained-,” he said. “But you get tired
of being there.” .

“It’s the little things you appre-

ciate,” he added. “I didn’t miss my-

car or TV, but I missed running
water, a roof over my head and a
working toilet.”.

At the beginning of September,-
Schneider found out that after eight

months, he would finally get to

come home. _
Schneider said he plans to com-

Pitt sophomore Tabetha Chedwick

needed a student loan to live on cam-
pus. She ﬁlled out a form and received
the loan -— along with the details of the

loan on a “big paper with tiny writing.-’<"=*

As college tuition becomes ‘increas-
ingly expensive across the nation, a
recent survey indicated that students
today have more debt than students
eight years ago.

And despite the importance of
loans for students, many, like
Chedwick, receive no help in under-

standing them or planning to payfor .:;

them. ~ A .

“It would be nice if they’d set up a
budget or monthly plan,” Chedwick
said, adding that, while she wasn’t sure
she would attend a class about under-
standing and plamiing for loans, she
worried about the length of time it
would take to pay them off.

But the rising cost of tuition does
not seem to be solely responsible for
the inﬂation of student debt —-
Chedwick said her loans grew only a
little since last year, in spite of a 9 per-
cent tuition increase.

Tuition for an in—state student at
Pitt rose by $710 in _the past year, from
$8,528 in the 2002-2003 school year to
$9,238 in the 2003-2004 school year. In
the past 3 years, tuition has risen by
$1,756. ' ,

Rising tuition costs create more stu-
dent debt. A student can take out a max-
imum of $5,500 each semester in stu-
dent loans, including subsidized and
unsubsidized Stafford and Perkins
loans. In 2001, 8.1 million U.S. stu-
dents borrowed an average of $7,600 to
ﬁnance. their educations.

The amount of money borrowed for
student loans does not reﬂect the total
amount of ﬁnancial aid received by the
average student, as many also received
money from scholarships and other
sources. — -

Federal loans nevertheless repre-

  Student debt has risen

sent almostltalf of the ﬁnancial I aid
given to students. '
Statistics compiled by Nellie Mac,
the leading national provider of federal
and private" education loansmindicate

 ‘the national average undergraduate debt

rose by 66 peroent between 1997: ~:and
2002, Themedian debt level for under-
graduates rose by 74 percent in the

“same time frame.

Graduate student debt increased 51
percent, while the median debt level for
graduate students has risen 72' percent.

The survey also found that 27 per-
cent of undergraduates used credit
cards to ﬁnance part, of_ their_ gollege
educations.“ Those who used credit
cards for that purpose also had a 20 per-

cent higher level of education loan debt. A

Student loan debt? -levels" have risen
steadily since 1988, the ﬁrst year Nellie
Mae conducted the borrower survey. ’

The 2002 survey published, in
February of 2003, also reﬂected how
borrowers perceived their education
debts. _

Black student borrowers express a
greater perception of burden, though
they also reported a lower debt-to-
income ratio, and less satisfaction or
belief that the beneﬁts of borrowing
were worth it, according to the survey
by Nellie Mae. . ﬂ

However, the majority of respon-
dents surveyed felt that the student
loans were important in providing them
access to higher_education. Borrowing
to ﬁnance higher education is a social
norm, considered to be an investment in
the borrower’s future,’ according to the
company’s survey conclusion.

Chedwick seemed to agree, ‘point-
ing out that she chose to pay more for
college in exchange for the benefits of
living on campus.

“I don’t mind that I have to pay it
back later,” said Chedwick, who said
she plans to attend medical school, and
acquire more debt, after she graduates.

' “Hopefully I’ll be able to under-
stand the hieroglyphics” of the loan
forms, she added.

Robbery and assault increase

States. ‘

The total number of crimes report-
ed in Pittsburgh were the second lowest
in the city for as long as such statistical
data has been kept. Homicides dropped
by 14.5 percent, and there was also a
decline in the number of larcenies and
motor vehicle thefts.

2....

However, the number of rapes
increased by 10.4 percent, robberies
increased by 16.8 percent and aggravat-
ed assaults went up sharply by 42.6 per-
cent.

In the rest of the nation, rape
increased ‘by 4 percent, robberies
dropped 1.2 percent and aggravated
assaults dropped 2 percent. ’

Zone 4 police declined to comment.

Should Pitt help Pittsburgh public schools?

Pittsburgh Public Schools are in
trouble. A recent task-force report
stated that the system is in shambles,
with 54 percent of students not read-
ing, and 61 percent unable to do math,
at their grade level.

Clearly, this calls for both govern-
ment and community action.
Everyone from Mayor Tom Murphy
to- Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, who
chaired a subcommittee that exam-
ined district leadership, commented
publicly on the report, showing that
the school system is a concern.

So, where does that leave Pitt?

Many Pitt students come from the
Pittsburgh area, and many of those
attended Pittsburgh’s public schools.
Pitt was once considered a local uni-
versity, serving Pittsburgh’s higher
education needs.

But as our admissions standards
rise — requiring higher grades, stan-
dardized test scores and class ranks
than before — is our mission still to
serve the community?

Or, in its effort to improve its aca-
demics and reputation, should Pitt no
longer regard Pittsburgh as one of its
primary sources of applicants? Has
Pitt surpassed Pittsburgh?

If Nordenberg is heading subcom-
mittees, then the town and gown -
Pittsburgh and Pitt -— connection has
not been severed fully. Still, the ques-
tion remains: How and to what extent

should Pitt helpthe community?

The students surveyed, the ones
unable to read and compute adequate-
ly, could bepotential Pitt students. If
given the proper opportunities, such
as better textbooks, enthusiastic
teachers and advanced classes, these
students could thrive. ’

And Pitt has the resources to
make it so. Some Pitt students already
work as student teachers; others vol-
unteer.

Some high school students can
cross-enroll and takePitt classes, but
that depends on the school they
attend. More schools should apply for
this, and the ones who have already
done so should encourage their stu-
dents to attend. Nothing prepares stu-
dents for college like actually going
to college.

But Pitt cannot do everything,
much less act as a panacea for an
entire school system. While encour-
aging local students to apply should
be a priority, it cannot be our sole
mission. Thus, it is up to the school
system to take advantage of Pitt,’s
resources. - ‘

Fostering potential Pitt students
stacks the deck in our favor, and
encouraging the school system to do
its job shows that Pitt — even as a
nationally recognized university —
has not forgotten its origins as a.com-
munity school.

Quality suggestions for drinking fun

Ask a college student to name humani-
ty’s greatest achievement, and you will most
likely get the response: “Beer!” If said col-

lege student does not name some kind of .

alcoholic product, then he or she is probably
drunk _ .

How can you blame them? It makes the
most reserved hermit a social butterﬂy, and it
makes ugly people hot. It also gives you a
viable excuse for nmning around with your
underwear on your head, yelling, “Rock ‘n’
roll forever!” before vomiting
profusely and passing out on
your friend’s davenport

But as wonderful a hobby
as drinking is in itself, there are
certain things you can do to
make the most of your inebriat-
ed state. Likewise, there are
some things you should avoid
doing.

Here’s a collection of what
you, a perfectly competent and
intelligent individual, should -
and should not — do while your
liver is bloated with enough toxins to war-
rant a Mr. Yuck sticker. A

If you’ve drunk enough that basic
motor skills are difficult, then you should
capitalize on your confused state. Do embar-
rassing things for small sums of money.
Make wagers with your friends. Bet that you

will voluntarily have your head shaved or.

. that you will cheerily dance on a table like
the women in “Coyote Ugly.” By now
you’re far too silly to care about your self-
image, and your nay-saying friends will be
forced to cough up the dough they risked
thinking you had dignity — silly them.
Besides, if you do anything really ridiculous,
you can blame it on the booze later. They’ll
understand.

Don’t take the dare thing too far,

i though. Those of you who read up on the

Darwin Awards may recall anincident in
1995 when an especially sauced Polish
farmer cut oif the end of his foot with a
chainsaw __ just to assert his masculinity.

 

V Kurt Esenwein
Columnist

Ostentatious showmanship like this will get
you nowhere.

One to—do is: Follow in the footsteps of-'

F. Scott Fitzgerald, the boozehound/author,
and use your keen, drunken insight to write
a best-selling novel that captures the spirit of
your generation. If you ﬁnd the prospect of
writing a novel intimidating, try writing a
dirtylimerick or two + just be sure to hire

an agent and get it copyrighted before it gets ‘

all over town and you miss out on the royal-
ties. . ’
‘ Being creative is good.
Standing in front of a state
trooper and making lewd
remarks about his or her
spouse is bad. State troopers
don’t have much of a sense of
humor in dealing with this sort
of thing, and after let’s say
forty minutes or so, he or she
may feel obligated to grab a
Breathalyzer and give your
mother yet another embarrass-
ing phone call.
Beer-fueled.trips to the grocery store are
also ill—advised. It seems like a good idea at
the time, but when you wake up the next
morning with a closet full of instant grits and
cake frosting, y_ou’ll wonder what could
have possibly been running through that
oxygen-starved brain of yours. Worst of all,
you’ll realize the money you spent on such"
frivolities could have been used to buy
things that were at least 50 proof.

The best thing you can do while drunk _

isbuy drinks for other people so that they
may share your obfuscated happiness.
Buying drinks makes instant friends.

So get out and party until your breath '

can ignite acetylene torches and your blood
becomes so alcohol-rich that it can be. served
in a shot glass. Just stay away from those car.
keys — state troopers don’t have a sense of

y humor about that either. ‘

_1ederhosen of the most odious politician to

Lieberman’s campaign against video games loses myvote

With so many different Democrats running for pres-
ident, it’s difﬁcult to decide who is best suited for the job.
Sensibly, you tend to choose whomever best addresses
the issues of highest personal priority. Equally important,
however, is the issue of electability. ,

For some, Senator Joe Lieberman ﬁts snugly in the
shoes of the most electable Democratic
presidential hopeful. ,

For me, he’s better suited to the chafing

refer to himself as a Democrat.

Let me explain: I have an almost debil-
itating love of video games — the more vio-
lent, the better. I can’t steal enough pixilated
cars, slaughter enough virtual foes or demol-
ish enough computer-rendered public build-
ings. It’s the most satisfying combination of
entertainment and therapy, without which I

. would never choose to live.

Lieberman, the supposed conscience of
the Senate, has made a political career out of bashing
video game companies and any other so—called cultural
polluters in American media. Deeply concerned by the
erosion of American cultural values, he championed the
use of the V-Chip, and has been known to cooperate with
such Senate moralists as Orrin Hatch and Jesse Helms.

In 2001, he‘ proposed the Media Marketing
Accountability Act, his latest in a long string of attacks
on the video game industry. It would make marketing
what the government deﬁnes as mature video games to
minors a punishable offense.

I don’t detest Lieberman simply for attacking the

 

J.P. Fridy

Columnist

very industry that I love so well. No, he is a much viler
beast than that because, you see, Sen. Lieberman partic-
ipates in that great American pastime of scapegoating.
On his Senate Web site, he makes the claim that “the
culture of carnage in which we are raising our children is
contributing to a general epidemic of youth. violence.”
But wait. I’ve long played violent video
games. I’ve taken the most visceral pleasure

my imaginary enemies only to splatter their
corpses with a rocket in a spectacular glis-
tening torrent of ﬂailing, delicious entrails.
Sure, they were already dead, but nothing
tops the satisfaction of seeing your foes
"reduced to quivering masses of gelatinous
meaty bits. 2

But upon my honor, I’m not a violent
person. I swear. rm sickened and appalled
by the violence visited upon countless vic-
. tims daily. And, typically, I don’t condone
ﬁghting as a means to settle disputes. So, despite having

-mowed down masses of computer-generated people in

cold digital blood, I’m a reasonably well-adjusted mem-
ber of society. - -_

I’m a 21-year-old college student who’s already well
aware of what’s right and wrong. But what about those
impressionable children? I’m glad you asked.

While I don’t deny.the zero- to 12-year-old demo-
graphic’s irnpressionability, I do question the source of
said impressions. Normally, kids ﬁgure out the world
under the close supervision and loving tutelage of their
parents. But if kidsare left to learn the world under the

in decapitating, irnpaling and bludgeoning ‘

mindless electronic gazes of Uncle Television and
Cousin CopSlaughter 4, we have a big problem. _

I don’t think all young children should be allowed
access to such violent games. If some parents feel it
impossible to raise well-adjusted children without con-
trolling their exposure to such things until a certain age,
then by all means, parents, censor away. Bully for you.

Should it really be the govemment’s job to monitor
such things? The day the government is acting as parent
to my hypothetical children and carefully controlling
what media they’re exposed to is the day I renounce my
citizenship and ﬂee. I

Of course, by then, I probably won’t be allowed to
freely leave the country anyway.

What’s most sickening about Lieberman’s stance on
the whole issue is his shameless hypocrisy. In his state-
ment at the beginning of the war in Iraq, Lieberman
referred to the conﬂict as “a task of high justice, necessi-
ty, and idealism in the best tradition of American princi-
ples and patriotism.”

Apparently, to Lieberman, real war, where real and
often irmocent_ people are slaughtered daily, is American
idealism of the best sort, but killing fake polygonal ene-
mies in an imaginary war is obviously crossing the line.

So, Joe Lieberman, for succumbing to the weak-
minded, buck-passing interpretation of violence in
American youth, then hypocritically turning and cheer-
ing preemptive war, you’ve lost all credibility to me. I
needn’t tell you, sir, not to count on my vote.

Ever since Michael Newdow ﬁled a .

hold until 2004.

Pledging allegiance to the politicaland the ridiculous

to the pledge. It was also around this time

lawsuit on behalf of his daughter’s non-exis-
tent political grievance last year, the-Pledge
of Allegiance has been getting some serious
face time in both the courts and the press.
You’ll remember Newdow as the man
who made the noble protestation that his
daughter does not deserve to be subjected to
the phrase ‘-‘under God” in the nation’s
pledge. In doing so, he kicked off a series of
court battles that are borderline absurd and
that ask the question: What is the pledge, and
why are we all so passionate about it?
Reuters reports that Newdow’s daugh-
ter still recites the pledge, despite the court’s

. 2-1 ruling in favor of her father, probably

because she never cared one Way or the
other to begin with. By using his daughter to

make a political statement, Newdow. has -

raised the bar for parents who want to live
vicariously through their children.

Back in February, around the time the
federal appeals court was throwing out the

Bush administ1ation’s request to review its

ruling in the Newdow case, a law took effect
in Pennsylvania requiring students to say the
pledge or face punishment. This prompted
the ACLU to drop its gloves and roll up its
sleeves, ﬁling suit faster than you could say
“one nation, under God.” The same thing
happened more recently in Colorado, where
state ofﬁcials decided to put their efforts on

A ing than most of these elected

' American to deny them the right

In these cases, it was the ACLU that
was being reasonable. I never thought I’d
see my ﬁngers type those words, but if you
think about it for- 10 seconds,
you will have done more think-

oﬁcials.

What kind of a country
forces its people to swear alle-
giance? If they choose not to rec-
ognize the ﬂag, you may call
them unpatriotic or unapprecia—
tive or whatever + that’s your
right. But it’s completely un-

to abstain. The notion that a
child should be punished for not '
robotically repeating a political slogan ﬂi
in the face of liberty, and has no place in a
free nation. ‘ I

In sorting through these cases, I found
that all this court drama starts to look more
typical in light of the pledge’s «unfortunate
history, which goes» a little something like
this.

The pledge was not composed by the
light of a rocket’s red glare in a ﬁeld stained
with the blood of patriots. It wasn’t born out
of the revolution. It was written relatively
recently, in 1892, by a socialist (!) named

Francis Bellamy. It originally read as fol- ,

 

Eric Miller

Columnist

lows: “I pledge allegiance to my Flag and to

the Republic for which it stands, one nation,

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all”

Bellamy wanted to include the word “equal-

ity,” but state superintendents

would not allow it — equali-

ty was not part of the agenda,

V at least not with women and
fonner slaves around.

Then, in the early ‘20s,

immigration, several groups
became concemed that new-
comers would be saying “my
Flag” while secretly thinking
about their homelands. So the
phrase was replaced with “the
ﬂag of the United States.”

Finally, in 1954, a push was made to
add “under God.” Some groups were sin-
cere about the phrase, hoping to cite the
nation’s connection to the almighty. But the
government had ulterior motives. The con-
gressional legislation favoring the change
states this goal: “[to] acknowledge the
dependence of our people and our
Government upon  the Creator  [and]
deny the atheistic and materialistic concept
of communism.” >_  ,

As part of an effort to snuﬁ out the athe-
istic, politically frightening communists, the
federal government supported adding God

during a period of heavy‘

that“In God We Trust” ﬁrst began to appear
on dollar bills. You can always count on
politicians to find faith when the timing is
convenient.

So by now, I’d say the pledge has
grown used to being a tool and Francis
Bellamy is well—accustomed to spinning in

.his grave, watching his masterwork get

worked and reworked by the dictates of
what’s happening now. '

So we should not be surprised when our
beloved version of the pledge gets nipped
and tucked. Government oﬂicials will use it
to try to force patriotism, the Michael
Newdows will use it to make headlines, and
the rest of us will get up in arms over some-
thing we should all be used to by now.

Do I think God should be mentioned in
the pledge? Yes. Our nation has a founda-

tional spiritual history that is worth mention- 1

ing, communism or not.

But I won’t give up on life if the phrase
gets the ax. God and America were here
before the pledge and they’ll likely be here
after it Just let me know when the San
Francisco courts start ruling the constitution
unconstitutional. -

Eric Miller realizes that it turned out kind of
cynical after all. Accept his apologies at

Thirteen we

Starring Evan Rachel Wood, Nikki
Reed, Holly Hunter

Directed by Catherine Hardwick
i‘ni‘r7ﬁ' 1/2

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A & E Editor

There’s a point in every teenager’s life when
rebellion becomes the norm. There are varying 
degrees of it, ranging from not listening to your?
parents to changing your entire lifestyle. Tracy
(Evan Rachel Wood), in Catherine Hardwick’s
“Thirteen,” falls into the latter category —— and then
some — of rebellion. , ~

Tracy is a 13-year-old starting out at a new school.
It’s quickly apparent to her that her style —- bright
clothes and shoes and socks with cartoon characters —
isn’t going to win her any popularity contests, cool
friends or looks from guys. That area of school life is
dominated by Evie (Nikki Reed), another 13-year-old
who wears the latest trends, has body piercings and

attracts all the guys. Tracy decides quickly that she

wants to be more Evie and less nerdy.

After Tracy steals a pocketbook full of cash to, A

impress Evie, the two become inseparable, with Evie
moving in with Tracy for a time. It wouldn’t be so bad
if Tracy’s home wasn’t in shambles. Her single moth-
er, Mel (Holly Hunter), is a recovering alcoholic trying
to hold her family, relationship with her boyfriend and
home together by working as a babysitter and beauti-
cian out of her house. Mel is also leery of the inﬂuence
Evie is having on her daughter — she sees Tracy get-
ting more wild and uncontrollable, taking up drugs and
alcohol and starting to do a little more than experiment
with sex, while wearing all the latest fashions despite
having no money. ~

Making things worse is Tracy’s afﬁnity for cutting
—— slashing her wrists, not to kill herself, but for the
thrill of coming close to death. When things go bad,
she heads to the bathroom to cut. When things go real-

“ . ' . . - sf - W
ly bad, you wonder if she’ll do more than just thrill-
seek. - '
. “Thirteen” is a ﬁlm that spirals the audience into a
world of excess and self-destruction that is incredible,
considering the fact that the cliaracters in that spiral are
13 years old: There are points in the ﬁlm where the sit-

uations and interactions between the characters»

becomes squirrn—in—your—seat uncomfortably real. The
last 20 minutes or so are the most intense, seeing Tracy
go from one bad situation to another, worse one.

‘ Nikki Reed, who also co-wrote the ﬁlm, and Evan
Rachel Wood really sell their characters. It would be
very easy to watch the ﬁlm and dismiss what’s
onscreen as unreal fantasy thanks to the extremity of
the situations — would anyone fathom, for instance, a
couple of 13-year-old girls trying to have a three-way
with a twenty—something neighbor? — ‘but Wood and
Reed make them believable and all too realistic.

Holly Hunter, though, upstages the young actors.
It’s not because she has more experience or has won
more awards. Instead, she takes her character, one that
could easily have fallen by the wayside in a ﬁlm about
13-year-old girls, and makes it unﬂinchingly real. The
hurt and, at times, betrayal she feels because of her
daughter aren’t contrived emotions with Hunter’s Mel.
.We might as well be watching Hunter play herself
rather than a character, because she is so convincing.

“Won ’t you let me walk you home from

school? Won ’t you let me meet you at

the pool? Maybe Friday I can get you
tickets for the dance and I ’ll take

you.

But the most interesting thing _about “Thirteen” is
the way it shows how such excessﬂand self-destruction
spurred by a cruel society is represented in American
ﬁlm. .

Up until this point, only characters in their twen-
ties, or at times, in their late teens, have been seen
struggling with society and its effects on them. Here,
though, that exploration is taken to the new, disturbing
and previously off—limits world of pre- ‘and early-teen
girls. A *

What is being said about American society at the
onset of the 21st century if 13-year-olds are out there
doing things many adults would consider too extreme?
Why do people so young feel the need to act the way
Tracy and Evie do in this ﬁlm? And what is to be done
about it? All areﬁinteresting questions posed by the
ﬁlm, but none are answered in any definitive way.

Still, it’s quite an accomplishment for such issues
to be posed in a ﬁlm, especially when you stop to con-
sider this is a ﬁlm written in part by a 15-year-old.

<3:

Beautiful graphics and music do not
make a great game. They contribute to the
effort, but the vast bulk‘ of the experience is
in the game play. That being said, PN .03 is
a stunning presentation, both visually and

aurally; the downside is that it’s as fun as

receiving blunt trauma to the forehead.

As mercenary Vanessa Z. Schneider,
your task is to inﬁltrate the stronghold of a
computer defense system gone berserk and
neutralize the situation. To do this, you’re
given a suit of form-ﬁtting cyber armor, that
allows you to ﬁre lasers from your palms,
ﬁre homing bursts from your spinal column
— you get the idea. ,

Despite the fact that Ms. Schneider is a
mercenary worthy of such superior ﬁre-
power, she is completely unable to do two
things at once. She can move, dodge, jump
and shoot; though combining any two of
these activities is ‘strictly taboo. One would
expect more freedom of movement from a
Super Nintendo game. Add some enemies
that can kill with one hit and —-— in a terrible
display of clipping — ﬁre through solid
walls, and the slow, clunky controls become

the knife in this game’s back. Fighting back
would seem like a good idea, save that it’s
driven entirely by a tenible lock-on system.
If an enemy unit is in constant sideways
motion across your ﬁeld of view, you can-
not, under any circurnstanoes, hit them. A
The music ——- a compilation of techno
tracks that seem suﬁicient to make the stal-
wart Vanessa tap her foot in the game —.-
sets the tone for the rage against the
machines. Apart from the violent use of
white space — white walls, white enemy
units, white suit, white everything — the
graphicsare pleasing: Who doesn’t_like see-
ing an athletic woman blowing things up

and contorting herself while she’s at ;it?-

Capcom went to lengths to drive home this
last part, neglecting the fact that, to appreci-
ate the graphics, people have to tolerate the
game ﬁrst.

P.N.03 is fun to watch, but only ‘if
you’re not playing. Granted, that means that
someone else is playing it, and that could
lead to violent strings of expletives, con-

trollers thrown about the room, damage to

the GameCube itself, and/or furniture over-
turned in a frenzied rage. Save your money
and wait for the upcoming Viewtiful Joe;
hopefully, it’ll make up for this painful
experience.

Loss shines
hghton

weaknesses
  Etws

  

There are plenty of explanations
that could be given as to why Pitt lost its
first game ever against a Mid-American
Conference team on Saturday night.

The offensive line seemed to have
trouble with the crowd noise, picking up
a handful of false-start penalties. That
could be a good reason, but the offense
was able to overcome all of those mis-
cues. _

Quarterback Rod Rutherford threw
his first two interceptions of the season,
which also happened to be the Panthers’
ﬁrst giveaways of the year. The first
pick hurt, mainly because it came right
after a Toledo fumble, but the second
one came after Pitt had already put 31
points on the board and, at that point,
the game should have already been
decided.

Pitt managed to gain just 74 yards
on the ground. A lack of balance on
offense isn’t good, but with the excep-
tion of the two turnovers, the passing
game was ﬂawless. Rutherford had his
third 300-yardgame of the year, wide A
receiver Larry Fitzgerald had a career-
best 201 yards receiving,_and tight end
Kris Vlrilson caught three touchdown
passes.

The problems with this loss are not
on the offensive side of the ball. This
loss is the fault of the defense and --
more importantly —— the defensive play
calling, which is rather troublesome. A

The Panthers’ defense put no pres-
sure on Toledo quarterback Bruce
Gradkowski, allowing him to throw for
almost 500 yards, and receivers Lance
Moore and Steve Odom combined for
26 receptions, 297 yards and two touch-
downs. .

Parents of football player sue priest and church

The parents of former Pitt football
player Billy Gaines, who fell to his
death from a church ceiling in’ June,
filed a $75 million dollar lawsuit
against Rev. Henry Krawczyk, who is
accused of giving Gaines and other Pitt
football player’s alcohol on‘ the evening
of the accident.

Police say Krawczyk hosted a bar-
beque for a few Pitt football players,
including Gaines, and provided them
with alcohol for several hours.
Krawczyk is facing

Madness, page 9

For three drives against the
Cardinals, Pitt allowed Ball State to
move down the ﬁeld with case. One of
those drives lasted nine plays and cov-
ered 80 yards before Ball State was able
to get into the end zone.

So what’s the reason for the
defense’s inability to stop the opposi-
tion? , .

Could it be a change in personnel?
The'Panthers didlose ﬁve starters from
last year’s squad, including both comer-
backs.

Could it be inexperience? While all
of the new starters had some game expe-
rience heading into the season, there are
some true freshmen who have found
their way into the rotation. V

As hinted at before, could it be the
coaching? Gradkowski dropped back to

-pass more than 60 times on Saturday,

but on only a ‘handful of those plays did
he throw a ball deeper’ than 10 yards,
and not one of those passes was com-
pleted. i

That means « that most ‘of the
Rockets’ plays were short, quick passes,
and most of those passes were no more
than two or three yards into the ﬂat, and
only became big plays because To1edo’s

receivers were able to run after the

catch.
How did Pitt’s defense react? By

The defense really-needs to rest

keeping» the comers well off the line of
scrimmage, giving the wideouts a nice
cushion and allowing them to make a
move after catching the ball.
Howpmany times does the elevator

door have to close on your foot before .

you realize your foot is in the way?
Apparently, more than 62 times.

Let’s also look at the other side of
this for a moment.

On the same day that Toledo defeat-
ed a top 10-team for the first time in
team history, Marshall shocked then-
No. 6 Kansas State on the road,
Northern Illinois knocked off Alabama
on the road, and Bowling Green almost
came back against Ohio State in
Columbus, Ohio. All four victorious
teams are members of the Mid-
American Conference. '

What a day for the MAC. “With the

. way they played last weekend, maybe

the Big Eastshould consider adding one
of those teams instead of someone from
Conference USA.

Or maybe the MAC should consid-
er taking on some Big East teams after
the conference falls apart.

Do you think they’d take Pitt?

‘Joe Marchilena is the sports editor for

The Pitt News and he ‘would like to
thank the Toledo fans for not running
him over or dropping the goalposts on
his head. Really, thank you. .
