Gunman identified inwester

By The Pitt News Staff

The Allegheny County medical examiner has
identiﬁed the alleged gunman responsible
for Thursday’s shooting at the Western Psy-
chiatric Institute. ,

Thirty—year-oldjohn Shick of Pittsburgh
allegedly opened ﬁre in a public area on the
ﬁrst floor of the Western Psychiatric Institute
Thursday at 1:40 p.m., killing one employee
and injuring seven other people before Pitt
police fatally wounded him.

The medical “examiner also identiﬁed

UPMC employee and Pitt graduate Michael
Schaab, 25, as the victim killed in the shoot-
ing. He was pronounced dead at 3 p.m. on
Thursday. According to a press release from
UPMC, Schaab worked as a therapist with
geriatricpatients. He had worked at UPMC
since 2008. ' .
Pitt police were the ﬁrst to arrive on the
scene, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl

* said at a press conference held on'Thurs-

day. .

“Their quick response saved lives today,”
he said. .

A Pitt police officer was grazed with a
bullet, but the mayor said the oﬂicer was
not signiﬁcantly harmed.

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said in a
statement released Saturday on Pitt’s website
that the intervention by Pitt police showed
their “courage and skill’-"as they risked their

. owns lives in the dangerous situation.

He said that Pitt police regularly train for
a wide range of situations “that we all hope

will never arise.” .

“It now seems clear that .the swift and —

effective actions of the Pitt police officers

who intervened eliminated the likelihood .

that the list of casualties might have risen

to a dramatically higher_ level,” Nordenberg A

said. “We all are in their debt.”

Pitt spokesman john Fedele said the
University is not releasing the name of the
injured ofﬁcer yet.

Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medi-
cine at UPMC, said in a press release posted

on UPMC’s website that the seven other,

people injured in the shooting, including
UPMC employees and a hospital visitor, are
expected to survive. _ . .
Ravenstahl said at Thursday’s press con-
ference that the gunman acted alohe, despite
reports that a second shooter might have

_ been on the second ﬂoor. The investigation

will cover the ﬁrst and second floors ofthe

building. _ «
“At this point, we have no reason to believe

that anyone else was involved,” he said.
Despite various reports, Ravenstahl also

conﬁrmed there was no hostage situation at-

UPMC Presbyterian or the Western Psych.
According to UPMC’s website, the West-
ern Psychiatric Institute and Clinic has pro-
vided patients with research-based care and
treatment of mental health and addictive dis-
orders for more than 60 years. The institute,

located on O_’Hara Street, provides a range of ; a
behavioral health services for individuals of ‘

all ages and at every stage of recovery. .
The shooting disrupted much of Oak-

land on Thursday, causing many surround- V '

nPsychiatric shooting‘

ing schools and universities to go on lock—
down. Pitt was on Spring Break at the time,
although many University buildings were
-open throughout the week. i
_ At 2:10 p.m. on Thursday, Pitt sent out
an Emergency Notiﬁcation Service alert that
said an active shooter was identiﬁed at West-
ern Psychiatric Institute and lockdown was
recommended. The notiﬁcation said that
multiple people had been injured and that
there was a possible second actor.
Around 5 p.m., UPMC sent out a press
release stating that there were a total of nine

V victims in the shooting, two of whom had

died. .

The other seven were being treated at
UPMC Presbyterian hospital, one block away
from Western Psychiatric Institute.

Another Pitt alert at 5:16 p.m. released
the lockdown on campus but told people to
avoid O’Hara and DeSoto streets. The Pitt
community got the all-clear at 5:55 p.m., and
normal campus operations were resumed.
Pitt canceled its bus services around West-
ern Psychiatric Institute for much of the

I‘ afternoon. .
“Consistent with the high priority that -
I Pitt has assigned to security, we planned

carefully and invested strategically to make
certain that we have both an effective emer-
gency notiﬁcation system and the technolog-
ical capacity to remotely monitor unfolding
events and to_ lock down at-risk facilities,”

1; Nordenberg said in his statement.

“When tested by this crisis on Thursday,
those systems seem to have func_tioned very
well.” i -

SGB brings bike-rental program -to William Pitt Union

. By Em Maier
For The Pitt News

‘ Starting today, students will no

longer have to climb Cardiac Hill
to get theincycling ﬁx. Bicycles will‘
now be available for rent from the

William Pitt Union’s information “

desk at an hourly or daily rate.

In fall 2010, former Student
Government Board member Lau-
ren Jentleson ran on a platform
of bringing a bike-share ‘program
to campus.

- It wasn’t until the middle of her
campaign that she discovered the
University already had-such a sys-
tem in place. So she began to work

with P_itt’s Intramural Program to’

improve the existing system, lo-
cated at the Baierl Student Rec-.
reation Center, and increase its
popularity. °

“The success at the Baierl ﬁt-
ness center was minimal; the pro-
gram wasn’t getting a lot of public-
ity or trafﬁc,”Jentleson said. _

l The rental program in the Union
will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
on weekdays. Bike rentals will also
remain available through the Baierl
Rec Center on weekdays during the
same hours, as well as on weekends
from 10 a.m. to 7 '

Students can rent bikes for $3
for a single hour and $2 for each
subsequent hour or for a total of
$10 per day. Baierl.only accepts
Panther Funds in payment for
the rentals, whereas the Union

will accept both cash and Panther '

Funds.

“It was in accordance with the
Universit_'y’s push to have a greener
and more sustainable campus,”
Jentleson said of the prografn’s
new lower—campus location. “It’s
an easier and nicer way to get
around.” , ,

The bikes will be located in an

. alcove between the William Pitt

Union and Bruce Hall, stored in

sealed lockers along with the hel-
mets. ‘

Jentleson said she doesn’t know
how many bikes the program has

or how.many will be stored in the ”

quad.

Though the program used to
be primarily geared toward recre-
ational cyclists, SGB has changed
its advertising tactics, now direct-
ing the program’s focus toward stu-
dents wishing to commute around

Jennie l\1artin  Fm‘ "l

campus.
After the spring term ends, SGB
and the Intramural Program will

‘ meet again to discuss the successes

and failures of the pilot program.

The program will not run in the . -

summer.

_ Jentleson said SGB Board mem-
ber Megan McGrath will act as a
transitional liaison to ensure the

program’s continuance into the
fall.

Sophomore Rebecca Callodo-
nato said she was surprised by
the program’s existence on upper
campus.

“I hadn’t heard aboutethe pro-
gram, but it seems like a really
great idea, especially with spring
around the corner. I think I would
personally have some slight trepi-
dation though % biking in Oakland
doesn’t seem to be for the faint of
heart,” she said. .

Jentleson and McGrath said
they are excited about the open-
ing of the program and believe the
program will increase student us-

. ers’ moods and health.

“[Biking] . is. another option
for students. The more options,
the happier they are,” _[entleson
said, I

  Don't blame colleges for I   p
  p (ieneratio|iY’sse|f-importance_

, Countless academics have char-

acterized our generation as
narcissistic, snobby and self-
important. But according to one
New York Times commentator,
university ofﬁcials might only

.have themselves to blame.

In a‘recent op-ed, Columbia
University professor Andrew
Delbanco argued that Rick San-
torum’s disdain for college “elit-

_. ism” isn’t entirely. unjustiﬁed.

High—ranking universities ' do

indeed foster a sense of superior- -

ity, he claims. At many Ivy League

-schools, administrators assure

each successive class of fresh-
men that they’re the “best and
brightest ever to walk through
the gates.” «
Until schools place a renewed
emphasis on “humility and
charity” —— the original tenets
of Protestant-founded universi-

‘ .. 3 ties like Harvard‘ and Princeton

— Delbanco believes the GOP’s

« attacks on higher education will
continue to resonate with a broad

swath of Americans.

Although we’ll be the ﬁrst to
acknowledge that the members
of Generation Y could stand to
gain some modesty, we’re not
sure colleges should bear the
blame for inﬂating their egos.

Mostyoung adults, regard-
less of whether or not they at-
tend four—year institutions, aren’t
lacking in self—esteem. A 2010
Pew Research Center report
characterized a majority of 18-
to 29-year—olds as “conﬁdent,”

‘ and numerous reports, including

a

study, have ‘found that students

enter college already convinced

of their intellectual prowess. ,
A more likely culprit for our
generation’s self—importance
problem is secondary-school
grade inﬂation. According to
the same study, 48- percent of
2009 college freshmen earned
an A or A- minus‘ average in high
school, as opposed to 19 percent
in 1966. j ' .
In any case, the notion that
universities onceinstilled more
“humility and charity” in their
students seems suspect. Protes-
tant or not, Ivy League schools
have long been associated with
exclusiveness and elitism —
Harvard, for instance, catered
to Boston’s social elite through-
out the 19th century, producing

generation. after generation of ‘

wealthy scholars. And since 1956,
there have never been fewer than
three graduates of either Harvard
or Yale on the Supreme Court.

If anything, the increased ac-‘ ‘
cessibility of college educations .

might have lessened Ivy Leagu-
ers’ elitismf
Humility is an important

virtue for young people to pos- .

sess, especially when they ‘owe
their achievements as much to
socioeconomic circumstances
as innate intellectual abilities.
At the same time, universities
shouldn’tbend over backward to
temper our generation’s inﬂated
egos — by the time students en-
roll in college; it might already
be too late. I j -

Students should take pride in their bodily ﬁmctions, says columnist Andrew Kaback

By Andrew Kaback
Columnist

l’m great at starting conversations
during the weekend hangout. I’m
personable, somewhat funny and
a really interesting person, Most
of my encounters usually go like
this: ’

“Why hello, attractive female
at this party. Yes, I did do that re-
ally impressive thing. Don’t worry
about it, I’m often mistaken for a
model. In fact, that fast and sleek
convertible is my car! What? I
would say I’m probably the per-
fect guy. I agree, we should totally
become romantically involved.” .

Unfortunately, the next step in

the interaction always requires arm .

movement. Maybe I would reach
for a coat on a hanger or place my

arm over the shoulder of the inter- ‘

ested female. Or worse, maybe I

would open up for the hug that said’

person of interest is so excited to
give me. See, once I move my arms
in any direction, it’s over.

 "I‘didn’t’ask my parents to give

_ me my genes. I love the nose, Dad, -

and I’m all about the hair, Mom;
but the positive acquisitions were

all for naught. See, I suffer from 9
what I call when—talking—to-peo- 5

ple—I—want—to—talk—to-my—deodor—
ant-always-fails-me—itis. _

Now there are plenty of times
that underarm sweat happens to
normal human beings. Going on
jogs, playing a sport and sitting
in a sauna are all perfectly accept-
able times to apply some extra
antiperspirant, and I assume that
most people don’t even think twice
about it. '

But then there’s me, going up to

School spirit here at P_itt.
Essentially, we need to stop

. looking at underarm sweat as pit

stains and start thinking about it as
Pitt stains! That’s right, I’m talking
about getting some serious school
spirit going. I know what you’re

thinking: “Gross!” Well, I’m not

entirely sure that you’re wrong
there. . . _

But do you know what else is
gross? Pitt school spirit lately.
Blame it on the teams all you.want
— they do deserve some serious

‘ blame. Remember the “High-

octane football coming to Heinz
Field” campaign? Well, we’re still
waiting on that arrival. Or the top-
'15 ranking of our basketball team?

. I guess that up and left like former _

player Khem Birch. '

The point is that there’s more
than one way to skin a cat, and
there’s more than one way to cure
personal and campus-wide ail-
ments. ‘So next time you’re at a
party and the attractive signiﬁcant-
other that you see begins to make

» you feel a little  anxious, throw

your hands up in the air. Take all
of the awkward self-photographs
you want from every weird hipster
angle. Give the class presentation
like you’re at a rock concert. Be
proud of reaching out to give ev-
eryone hugs. ' -

You know why? Pitt stains are
all about school spirit. Don’t get

-down; you’re just letting everyone .

know that you love your school. y

the actions of a government you
never elected in order to satisfy
the demands of some Germans
and, worse still, surrender to the
French. This also allows the politi-
cal parties in Greece to paper over
an inconvenient fact — ‘that they’d
lied for years about those beneﬁts,
because maintaining them was
ﬁscally unsustainable. It’s much
easier to blame it all on the Ger-

mans than on Greek politicians‘

and those who elected them. A Eu-
ropean democracy deﬁcit becomes
a strong argument for leaving the
euro behind entirely: Why should a

country belong to an organization '

that does things the cit_izens don’t

like, with no obvious 0* tion for
p \

tralization of power often breeds
discontent. Consider Yugoslavia.
Marshal Tito tried to bring the
fractious Balkans together and rule
them from Belgrade,» and within

10 years of his death peripheral .
nations like Croatia felt marginal- P

ized. Therewas an outbreak of na-

tionalism and the messy breakup

of Yugoslavia. _ 7
I’m not suggesting that the EU

-will ‘experience the equivalent of

the'Yugoslav Civil War, but when
there ﬁnally is a backlash against
an overweening Brussels, when
nationalist political parties" gain
power in vari'ous member coun-
tries and when the people of those
member countries fail to see the
beneﬁts of being bossed around
by leaders they didn’t elect, there’s
a very real potential for a messy
breakup.

Europe has flirted with not-
very—democratic governments in
the past, and all of them ended
badly. It looks as though the EU
might be continuing in this unfor-
tunate pattern. I -

A look back

  NCAA Tournament seasons

Senior Staff Writer

Over the past decade, the Pitt
men’s basketballteam has ap-
peared in 10 straight NCAA
Tournaments.

The Panthersﬁnished with a

.-winning record in the Big East _

each year and neverﬁnished in
the lower halfofthe conference
standings. They won two Big

: East tournament titles in 2002

and'2003 and took home at least

season championship in 2002»,
2003, 2oo4 and 2011.

This year, Pitt ﬁnished 13th
in the Big East standings with a
conference record below .500.
As the Panthers’ NCAA Tourna-
ment stretlk comes to an end,
let’s look back on 10 years of
success, starting with the last
time Pitt played in the National
Invitation Tournament. _ 3

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
wasn’t supposed to struggle this
season. The Panthers were sup-
posed to cruise through another
regular season and ﬁnish in the

top half of the Big East Conference. .

On Selection Sunday, the team was
-supposed to siteagerly awaiting
the announcement of its seed in
this year’s NCAA Tournament.
Panther fans were supposed
to stress overwhether Pitt would
ﬁnally get to a FinalFour this sea-
son. Instead, they will get to see
the team at home in the College
Basketball Invitational, after the
Panthers could not get a bid to
the National Invitational Tour-
nament. M
‘ So what went wrong?An_d can
the Panthers recover? The Pitt

News talked to NBE Basketball,

Report blogger and analyst Ray
Mernagh to ﬁnd out. The NBE
Basketball Report is a blog that

, oﬁers college basketball analysis,

recruiting updates and event cov-
erage.

The ‘Pitt News: What do you
think Pitt hasn’t done this year that
it has ginyears past to keep the team
successful?

Ray Mernagh: They’ve been ex-

‘ tremely poor defensively, both on

the perimeter and in the post.

TPN: How badly did the loss of
Khem Birch affect the team?

RM: More than anyone real-
izes. Khem was a game‘-changer
defensively with his shot-blocking
andwould’ve been a ﬁnisher of-
fensively in transition for them
as the season progressed. Birch’s
departure and Travon [Woodall]’s
injury really led to the downward
spiral the team found itself in.

TPN: What led to Ashton Gibbs

. and Nasir Robinson having argu-

ably -subpar senior seasons? ’

RM: Well, I would argue that .

Nasir really didn’t play all that

' badly with what he has to work

with. He’s always been limited in
size ‘and skill‘-set, but this year,
with’ the lack of parts surround-
ing him, those limitations were
really exposed a lot more. Ashton’s

_ poor playqhad to do with the lack ‘of

a suitable backup at -point guard,

which I think you put on Dixon.

Because of that, he was forced to
do things he’s not capable of do-
ing. I think whatl said about'Na—
sir also applies to Ashton in that
he’s always had p'i_eces around him

that were capable of defending and _

setting him up offensively. Ash-

ton Gibbs has never been a good '

defender and this season he was

downright awful. I also think that
‘ neither led in the way that most

expected, especially Gibbs.

TPN: Who strikes you as this
team’s leader? Does it have one?

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Experts discuss the Panthersstruggles,

winless Big Eas

jasper Wilson
Staﬁ” Writer

As the youngest NCAA Division I
women’s basketball team in the na-
tion, the Panthers were expected to
struggle this season.

It’sthe extent of the struggle tha

With a roster composed solel ,,

N of freshmen and sophomores, the
“ Panthers failed to record a single Big

East win and ﬁnished with an overall ,
record of 8-22, including 0-16 in Big
East play. ’

But Karen Price, the Pitt women’s
basketball beat writer forthe Pitts-
burgh Tribune—Review, said that
youth can’t be the only explanation
for the team’s struggles.

,“Youth doesn’t completely explain
away an 0-16 Big East season,”.she

5 said. “There’s something else going b

on there that’s not getting through
to these kids.” S ~

Despite the team’s ﬁnal record,
some results show that the team has
talent. The Panthers beat an NCAA

V Tournament-bound Michigan State

team to win the Caribbean Classic
back in December. In the past two
months, Pitt took DePaul and Louis-
ville — also projected NCAA Touma—
ment teams — to the buzzer.

But‘ indicating the opposite are
other results, includingsizeable losses
to the other bottom teams in the Big

. East: 72-48 to Marquette, 66-50 to

Providence and, perhaps most alarm-
ingly, 63-39 to‘Seton Hall. Before the
Pirates’ win over Pitt in the last game
of the regular season, Seton Hall also
hadn’t won a Big East game.

Mechelle Voepel, who covers
women’s basketball for ESPN.corn,
couldn’t believe that ﬁnal tally.

“I look at the Seton Hall game, and
it looked like th‘ey;gave up,” Voepel
said. ‘‘That’s the,-iglarne you thought,
‘If there’s any game they can get up
for, it was that one.”’

Price agreed.

“To come out and not really com-
pete against Seton Hall is inexcus-

able,” she said. “There’s no excuse '

for that when you’re facing the one
team in the conference that you le-
gitimately should beat.”

Price said that, unlike losses ear-
lier in the season, the Seton Hall game
came after the players had experi-
enced afull Big East slate. ‘

.“To absolutely not even make it a
game, you can’t blame that on youth
and inexperience,” Price said. “These
kidsgbythis point, had played awhole

ence mark as a “red ﬂag” and said
the results raise questions about the
team’s effort. ‘

“Is your team still ﬁghting and“
playing hard?” Voepel questioned. >

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato

- said she thinks so: She mentioned the

team’s efforts when lookingfor posi-

tive observationsto take away from '

the season’s disappointments.

Freshman point guard Briarma
Kiesel provided the only constantfor
the Panthers. She led the team in min-
utes played (36.2), points per game
(13.2) and assists per game (3).

Her efforts earned her a unani-
mous selection to the Big East All-
Freshman Team. ‘

“She was the one player who im-
pressed me every game I saw,” Price
said. “Foratrue freshman to play the

kind of minutes she did and have that ‘ I

kind of pressurelofbeingthe starting
point guard is unreal. She responded
as well as she possibly could have.”

’ Pittsburgh Post- Gazette women’s
basketball beatwriter Paul Zeise said
Kiesel provides the Panthers with a
go-to player who can score baskets.

Redshirt sophomore Ashlee An-
dersoh was the only other player
to end the season averaging double
ﬁgures, having scored 10.6 po_ints
per game.

The failure of the players to ﬁll
a void created by injuries surprised
Berenato. ,

“You’re expecting more from

' returners, and they didn’t have it,”

Voepel described the 0-16 confer-

Berenato said. .

Price said that next year will
decide how the trio of sophomores
'— Anderson, Leeza Burdgess and
Marquel Davis — are perceived. ,

“There’s no excuses forthem next
year,” Price said. “All three of those
girls need to ramp up their games.

' They need to show more than th

didthis year.” I
Berenato described improvement
in the play of Burdgess and fellow

sophomore Kyra Dunn in particular '

as building blocks for the future. Zeise
said that Burdgess showed promise
down the stretch and, along with Kie-
sel, could provide an outside—inside
game.

This summer, Berenato explained,
will be crucial to the team’s develop-
ment going into next season. During-
the summer, coaches'aren’t allowed to
work with theplayers, so the respon-
sibility falls on the team.

“They need to [improve] ,” Ber-
enato said. “Obviously they just went
through a really rough year. We’re go-
ing to need great leadership. They’re
going to have to [work hard] .”

_A recurring aspect of the team’s
performance this year, whether in a
single game or overaspan of contests,
was inconsistency. '

“It really was kind of maddening

for everyone how inconsistent they .

were,” Price said.
Pitt followed up its tight contest

The Pitt News sportsstaff plays selectionp committee

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

How hard can it be to.se.lectthe
NCAA Tournament ﬁeld?

Over the course of two weeks,
The Pitt-News followed the se-
lection committee’s principles

’ and procedures-‘to mimic the

process of forming the tourna-
ment bracket. Using the same

. rules that the real committee

follows, we hoped to achieve a
valid, fair bracket and also learn
about the challenges of the pro-
cess along the way. . .
The 10—person selection com-

mittee has three tasks: select

37 at—large teams, seed the at-
large and automatic bids No. 1.
through No. 68 and, in the final
step, arrange the teams inthe
bracket. The committee spends
by far the most time on the fl_I‘St
step, just as we did.

Before the committee gath-
ers, members receive a list of all
eligible Division I programs in
alphabetical order (to eliminate

initial ballot in the form of a
two-column list: the first col-
umn for “at-large selections”
and the second for “at—large
considerations.” ’

The first column, in short,
is for locks, or, as the guide-

’ lines state, “teams that, in that

member’s opinion, shouldbe

. at-large selections in the tour-

nament based upon play to date,
regardless of whether the team
could eventually represent its
conference as an automatic
qualiﬁer.” _
The second column is for
teams with something left to
prove. They aren’t in, but they
aren’t out. “There is no mini-
mum or maximum limit in the
second column; however, only
teams meriting serious consid-
eration should receive votes.”
When The Pitt N'ewssubmit—
ted our ballots in the ﬁnal week

‘of the regular‘ season, 70 dif-

ferent schools appeared in the
second column on ataleast one

ballot.

If a school receives eight

 

 

10—person committee, i_t is in
the tournament. In our si-x—per-
son committee, we required five
votes. Twenty—two teams earned
a bid through this step, includ-
ing Kansas, Duke, North Caro-
lina, Syracuse, Murray State,
Temple and New Mexico.

If a school receives more than
one vote in either column but
not enough first-column votes

.to receive a bid, it moves to an . T

“under-consideration board.”

Call this the bubble. Schools '

that won or shared their regu-

lar-season conference champi-
onships are also automatically
included on the board, as are
schools that a committee mem-
ber verbally recommends.

Our bubble started with 63'

programs. They included Saint
Mary’s, UNLV and Vanderbilt,
which fell one vote short of re-
ceiving an at—large bid through
the initial ballot. It also .in—
cluded Long Island—Brooklyn,
Stony Brook and five other mid-
majors that won regular-season
titles but did not receive enough

, schools to the under—consider-‘

many mid-major regular-season

champions and the last ofwhichc

purged Oregon, St.]oseph’s and
dther schools that stumbled in
conference tournaments.

As the under—consideration
board shifts with conference
tournament play, the committee
slowly awards at-large bids to
schools. The process is tedious
and repetitive. I

First, each member lists,
in his or her opinion, the best
eight teams on the under—con—
sideration board.-Those votes
are tallied, and the eight teams
that receive themost are placed
on the'at—large ballot. Members
then rank those eight teams N o.
1 through No. 8. The committee
totals those ballots, and the four
schools with the lowest totals
receive at—large bids. V

Gradually, members select
just six and then four schools at
a time based on the number of
teams left under consideration.
The process cycles, again and
again, until the committee has
37 at—large teams. '

When and how, a team re-
ceives its -bid does not influence
its seed later on. '

With each ballot, decisions
grow tougher. Gonzaga, UNLV,
Vanderbilt, Iowa State, Mem-
phis, Purdue‘, Creighton and
Virginia joined the field easily
enough to bring our at—large
field to 30. But when ranking
South Florida, Brigham Young,
California and Texas, all four
schools received both ﬁrst—place
and last—place votes, and the

difference between Cal_ifornia'

earning a bid and Texas'return-
ing to the bubble was asingle
point. .

Some schools lingered on the
bubble vote after vote. Alabama
and Saint~Louis repeatedly re-
ceived enough votes toappear
on the at—large‘ballot, only for
members toprank them in the
bottom’ half. Eventually, though,
they made it. 1

As Selection Sunday neare_d, .

schools started to earn automat-
ic bids. Some early automatic
bids, such as those to Loyola and

‘ U'NC-Asheville, didn’t impact.

our committee, as those schools
were not under at—large consid-
eration. Conference tournament
wins for Murray State, Creigh-
ton and Saintij“1\7;[ary’s, though,
moved them fron1'::at-large to an-

tomatic ber_ths;-ifreeing up bids »

for other bubble teams’.

As Saturday’s games went fi-
nal and Sunday’s title matchups
formed, we knew there would

_ be five to six additional at—large.

bids available for 14 remaining
teams on the under—consider—
‘ation board: Arizona, Colorado

State, Drexel, Iona, Marshall,

Miami, Mississippi State, North.

Carolina State, Northwestern,
Seton Hall, Tennessee, Texas,
Washington and Xavier. We
had these schoolsﬂranked No. 1
through No. 14 to allocate bids

based on the number avail—_

’Texas,_Xavier, North Caro-

the next team in our rankings.
St. Bonaventure, though, won
in an upset, and Seton Hall did
not make our bracket.

, To evaluate‘ tournament
resumes, the guidelines note
that “each committee member
independently evaluates a vast

' amount of information during

the process to make individual
decisions. It is these qualita-
tive, quantitative and subjective
opinions  that each individual
ultimately will determine their
vote on all issues related to se-
lections, seeding and bracket-
ing.” I -

Statistical information, in-
cluding the "Rating Percentage

Index, can be used by committee ,

members in any manner they
choose, if they choose to use
it at all. _ ' '
Discussions with fellow
members, athletic directors,
coaches and commissioners also
influence decisions. But there
are strict rules about who can
talk ‘about what. Any commit-

tee member associated with .a‘
school c_annot lobby or vote on’

ballots containing that school.
Committee member Jamie Za-
ninovich, the commissioner of
the West Coast Conference, is
excused from discussions and
votes regarding Gonzaga, Saint

- Mary’s and Brigham Young.

The committee seeds teams
much like it selects at-large
teams. Of all the automatic and
at-large teams, each member se-
lects the subjective “top eight,”
and then the committee settles
on four using thesame process
as governs the at§la_rge.Vballots..
Seed and repeat, No. ihthrough
No. 68.

The top 16 teams are kept

' separated as No. 1 through No.
. 16, as one goal of the bracket

is to balance each region’s top
teams. No. 1, No. 8, No. 9 and
No. 16 are grouped in one re-
gion, No. 2, No. 7, No. 10 and
No. 15 in another, and so on, as
best as possible.

After the top 16 teams, the
rest are grouped into fours
called “seed lines.” For instance,
in our bracket, Ohio State, Da-
vidson, New Mexico State and
Montana are all equal on the
No. 14 seed line‘.

The committee can “scrub”
seeds and vote to shift a school
up or down upon review. We
considered scrubbing our ini-
tial rankings of North Caroli-
na, Kansas and Missouri as the
conference tournaments played
out‘: '

Seedingjbegins before at-
large selection ends, and it does

- not have to occur in numerical

order. We seeded through Lou-
isville on the No. 5 seed‘line and
then filled the bottom fourth of
the bracket with‘at—large teams
as'we waited to decide the fates
of bubble teams.

Placing teams into the brack-
et'is an art guided by subjec-
tive principles. The committee
must spread out teams from
the same conference, which is a
challenge with Big East schools.
Host schools cannot play where
they are hosting, which means
Ohio State is not allowed to play
in Columbus this year.

Regular—seas_on_ rematches
are avoided in the early rounds,
as are rematches of previ-
ous years’ Tournament games
(Syracuse and Vermont, for in-
stance). The top‘ teams cannot
have a home-court disadvantage
otfopening weekend, and all
teams must remain as close to
their “areas of natural interest
as possible.”, ’ '

'To facilitate this, schools can
move either one seed line up or
down. .

Among the top teams, the
committee assigns sites in order
of true seed. We assigned Ken-
tucky, our overall No. 1, the Lou-
isville site for games Thursday
and Saturday. Syracuse received

' Pittsburgh, Kansas" received

Omaha and North Carolina re-
ceived Greensboro.

  Panthers fallshort of first

Big East Conference win _

Byjasper Wilson
Staﬁ” Writer

The ﬁrst half of the Pitt women’s basketball

team’s Big East tournament game began the 7

same way as so many of the Panthers’ games
this season, ,

The team struggled on offense while its
opposition began to put the game away. But
in the second half, madness ensued. _

The Panthers shook off a poor start —
erasing a21—point deﬁcit in the process 4 as
they pushed South‘ Florida (17-14, 8-8 Big

East) to the brinkbefore ultimately falling '

at the buzzer 60-59. A b
With the loss, the Pitt women (8-22, 0-16

Big East) ended the year with"16 straight
‘losses. . p
The season has taken a toll on head coach

Agnus Berenato. ' A

“It’s been a really rough season,”. an emo— ,

tional Berenato said before pausing to collect
herself. “And I’m really proud of my team.”

At the beginning of the game, South
Florida’s Inga Orekhova single-handedly

_ weakened the Panthers with her offensive

prowess. — g
The few times that Pitt did answer on

the offensive end, Orekhova immediately -

responded for the Bulls. _

She made a jumper as time expired before
the break, bringing her ﬁrst-half scoring
total to 21 points. At that point, she had
outscored the entire Pitt team. The Panthers
trailed South Florida 39-20 at the break.

Leeza Burdgess’ foul trouble compounded
Pitt’s problems. She picked up her third foul
with 9:07 left in the ﬁrst half.

The young team appeared deﬂated and

_ on its way to one ﬁnal blowout.

But following the break, Pitt exploded.

The Pitt \«vomcn”s basl<ethall tcani lost its first Big East tournament game.

After the Bulls extended their lead to 21
points, Pitt went 0n_a 19-2 run, and suddenly
the game was within reach at 45-39;

Burdgess played a key role in the team’s
resurgence, scoring all 11 of her points in
the second half while managing tokeep out
of foul trouble. _ .

“We knew we were going to ride Lee-
za,” Berenato said. “She commanded the
paint.” ,

Her presenceinside often meant that
Burdgess was double— or triple-teamed, and
she was able to take advantage by passing
out of the pressure. She ﬁnished with four
assists. . V

' Needing to counter, South Florida pushed
the lead to nine. But the Bulls seemed to
be wilting. Orekhova effectively vanished,
managing just four points in the half.

“[In the] ﬁrst half, they basically left me

. open so I took the shots,” she said. “Second

half they did the box—and-one so the girl was
defending me real strong and I couldn’t get
the ball.” I . -

That girl was Abby Dowd. The Pitt sopho-
more, who didn’t score any points and played
the entire second half, blanketed the Ukrai-
nian basketball player.

. Orekhova’s disappearance meant that the
Bulls had no one to carry them. It was their
turn to self—destruct, and they nearly did.

South Florida connected on just 2 of 19
3—pointers in the second half and shot 20.6
percent from the ﬁeld. '

Head coachjose Fernandez said he knew

-that couldn’t happen.

“That’s how leads evaporate. And that’s
what it did, it evaporated,” Fernandez
said. . 1

Point guard Brianna Kiesel seemed to
sense USF’s vulnerability and went on the
attack. ﬂ

Pitt loses in second round
  of tournament  

“nits;

Steve Garﬁnkel I Assitant Visual Editor

Ashton Gibbs and the Panthers fell to Georgetown in the second round.

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

There was a time when Pitt was_the team to
beat in the Big East tournament.

The Panthers went to four straight tour-
nament championship games from 2001 to

_ 2004 and won the University’s ﬁrst title in

2003. Pitt fell in the quarterﬁnals in 2005
but then made three more consecutive ti-
tle games. The team took home its second
championship in 2008.

But since then, Madison Square Garden
has become much less of a second home.

Pitt earned double byes in 2009, 2010
and 2011, but lost its ﬁrst game each year.
This season, as the No. 13 seed, the Panthers
started playing for their NCAA Tournament
lives Tuesday on the ﬁrst day of the tourna-
ment. Although seniors Ashton Gibbs and
Nasir Robinson picked up their ﬁrst—ever
Big East tournament win over St. John’s,
Pitt fell a day later to Georgetown, ending
all hope of earning an NCAA Tournament
bid.

Pitt 73, St.]ohn’s 59

Before this season, Gibbs and Robinson
had only played for squads that received

. double byes through the ﬁrst two rounds

at Madison Square Garden. Those teams al-

ready had NCAA Tournament bids wrapped

up —— but those teams also never won a

game at the venue.

This season, with March Madness

dreams on the line, the No. 13-seeded Pan-
thers defeated No. 12—seeded St.]ohn’s 73-
59 to advance to the second round of the
Big East tournament. St.J0hn’s lost its ﬁrst
game in the Big East tournament for the
ﬁrst time in three years.

“It’s deﬁnitely a little weird,” Gibbs
saidof earning his ﬁrst win in the con-
ference tournament. “Especially the past

"three years we had a lot moresuccess in

the regular season. It was a good win for us
today — it started on the defensive end and
[we] let it carry to the offensive end.”

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said the
Panthers defended well and performed well
enough on the boards — Pitt out—rebound-
ed the Red Storm 40-39. Much like the two
teams’ ﬁrst meeting this season — an 89-
69 Pitt win on Feb. 29 — the Panthers re-
mained patient offensively and took apart
their opponents’ matchup zone.

“We moved the ball pretty well in both
games we played against them,” Dixon said.
“We had 10 guys out there giving us good
minutes, and that’s something we’re going
to need.” —

While Pitt did turn the ball over 13 times
against the Red Storm’s press, Dixon said
the Panthers took good shots once they
broke through and didn’t rush their of-

. fense.

, Pitt used a balanced scoring attack to
pull away from St. John’s in the second
half. Gibbs scored a team-high 20 points
while Robinson added 15 points and eight

rebounds. .

The bracket is out. The ﬁeld is set. ESPN
analyst Doug Gottlieb might try to sell
you on No. 13 seed Montana — despite its
losses to North Dakota, -San Francisco and
Oregon State — but here are four better
bets to dance all the way to the Final Four
in New Orleans.

South Region — Kentucky Wildcats
V Kentucky is the best team in the nation.
The Wildcats lost to Indiana 73-72 at As-
sembly Hall-in. December, but they won’t
face any road-court disadvantage like that in

the tournament. Theyzdo have a bumpy road ‘

— Connecticut, Wichita State and Duke,
possibly —— but they have handled tough
opponents all season.

The Wildcats beat Kansas by 10 at Madi—
son Square Garden. They beat North Caro-

lina, Louisville and Florida at home. They‘

thumped Florida againon the road and de-

' feated the Gators yet again in the conference

tournament. .

Vanderbilt did beat them, 71-64, in the
SEC title game, because the Wildcats had
their sights on loftier prizes. Whom can you
conﬁdently choose over the school with An-
thony Davis’ wingspan?

Second-bestguess: honestly, nobody

West Region —— Missouri Tigers

Missouri, the winner of the Big 12 tour-
nament, deserved a No. 1 seed. Undefeated
outside of their conference, the No. 2 seed

MCI‘ Campus

Tigers average 80 points per game and have
four guards who average a double—digit scor-
ing clip. They will spread you out and knock
down shots, as,Baylor, Kansas and especially
Notre Dame know. The Tigers_ crushed the
Irish by 29 in late November. '

With No. 1 seed_ Michigan State handed a
tough possible third—round matchup against

No. 8 seed Memphis, a path is clear for Mis— -

s_ouri. «
Second-best guess: another group of
Tigers, Memphis

East Region —. Gonzaga Bulldogs

You didn’t come here to read about a
bunch of No. 1 and No. 2 seeds. Here’s how
it goes down: Hot—shooting No. 5 seed Van-
derbilt or steady No. 4 seed Wisconsin stuns
Syracuse, whose rebounding woes are ex-
posed somewhere down the line. Meanwhile,
Gonzaga’s Robert Sacre and Elias Harris
(combined rebounds per game: 15) match
up well againstjared Sullinger of Ohio State,
and the Bulldogs pull off the upset.

From there, it’s a grab-bag. Cincinnati,
Florida State, Gonzaga, Vanderbilt and Wis-
consin all have their ﬂaws. Give it to the
Bulldogs, who haven’t made the Elite Eight
since 1999. They’re due, I tell ya. Due!

Second-best guess: Cincinnati
Bearcats, fresh offa strong Big East tour-
namentc ~

Midwest Region — Belmont Bruins

Kansas can’t escape the mid—major. The
Jayhawks were rock-chalked by Northern
Iowa two tournaments ago and upset by

Due to the number of talented front-
court players in the Big East, Pitt dearly
missed McGhee’s physical play and re-
bounding in the paint. The Panthers were

left with Dante Taylor, Nasir Robinson, ’

Ta.lib.Za,nna,' Malcolm Gilbert and Khem
Birch, before the freshman Birch left Pitt
for UN~LV. A

Despite Robinson’s hard-nosed style of
play and great hustle, he still proved to be

blocking prowess but struggled to guard

On the perimeter, no’ player stepped‘

up .to provide the defensive intensity’
Wanamaker and Brown brought to the
court last year. Multiple guards posted
high-scoring totals against Pitt, and their
successes contributed to many Panther
defeats, including the upset losses against
Long Beach State and Wagner in noncon-

-ference play. A ‘V

The inability to guard talented perim-
eter players played a direct role in the
Panthers’ rise in scoring defense. Pitt al-
lowed 66.2 points per game this season

' — making the team No. 126 in the nation

and ninth in the Big East. Last year, Pitt

owned the best defense in the Big East,

giving up 60.1 points per game.
The absence of Wanamaker impacted
the Panthers offensively as much as de-

1 fensively. That, combined with the time

missed by Woodall due to injury, con-
tributed to the drop inlproductivity from
Gibbs. For the first time in league history,
the Big East Preseason Player of "the Year

Pittsburgh to host in
NCAA Tournament games

By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ Writer

Even though the Pitt men’s basketball team
won’t be taking part, the NCAA Tournament
will return to Pittsburgh this season for the
' ﬁrst time since 2002. Q
The Consol Energy Center, Pittsburgh’s
-multipurpose indoor arena that is less than
'2 years old, will host'ﬁrst- and second-round
tournament games. 1
Local fans can see No.-1-seed Syracuse vs.
No. 16 UNC-Asheville, No. 8 Kansas State vs.
No. 9 Southern Miss, No. 10 Gonzaga vs. No. 7
Virginia and N o. 2 Ohio State vs. No. 15 Loyola
(Md.). p ‘ '
. Duquesne University, paired with the Consol
Energy Center and tourism promotion agency
VisitPittsburgh, will host the games. Duquesne
also served as host the two previous times the
NCAA Tournament came to Pittsburgh — in

1997 and 2002 at the Civic Arena, which was ~

- renamed the Mellon Arena in 1999.
Duquesne ‘has had more than two years

to prepare for the tournament, as the bid se-, '

lection took place in-September 2009 after
members from Duquesne, the Consol Energy
Center and VisitPittsburgh drew up a speciﬁc
plan for the tournament.

- “The bid was submitted in spring 2009 and
was awarded in September 2009,” Duquesne
Associate Athletic Director_Phil Racicot said
in an email. “The process entails a lot of work
regarding building speciﬁcations, ticket-sale

projections, city amenities and hotel guaran— ‘

tees (number of quality hotels within a certain
radius, etc.), proximity to the airport as well
as ability of the host to set up and prepare the
actual event.”

Racicot and Athletic Director GregAmodio
weren’t at Duquesne for either of the ﬁrst two
tournament rounds that Duquesne hosted, but
they do have some members still on their staff
and ciirrently working at the Consol Energy
Center who have experience hosting NCAA
Tournament games. , S A ' V

Despite the experience, the hosts are effec-
tively dealing with a new tournament, as the
growth in popularity of college basketball over
the past 10 years has turned the NCAA Touma—

' - ment into a premier-sporting event.

“We have several staff memb_ers both here
and at Consol that have experience with the
event,” Racicot said. ‘With that said, [the com-
petition] has changed or evolved a1ot_since

‘ then, aswell, especially regarding technology
— enhanced TV coverage. All games are "on in

CAA now brings in a site-speciﬁc court.”

W-.. Although no local teams appear headed
A to Pittsburgh, the region has been extremely‘

supportive of the tournament and sold out the
event in the fall -— well before fans could even

predict who would be playing where. '

A  has an even larger scope now. For example, the

“The event has been sold out since Octo-
ber,” Racicot said. “Pittsburgh sold the most

tickets of all eight sites in the pr-esale last April. '

Certainly the team selection will have an impact
on travel and tourism.”

In 2002, the hosts had the beneﬁt of hav— _ _

ing the hometown Panthers staying in town.
Although a hometown team helps’ secondary
ticket sales and excitement for the host com-
mittee, it leads to other businesses not receiv-
ing the economic beneﬁts that they would from
a traveling fan base. - .

“Certainly having a local team brings addi-.
tional excitement to the area and could impact

ticket sales in the secpndaryticket market,”-

-_Racicot said. “On the other hand, businesses

like hotels and transportation do not beneﬁt _

as muchfroma local team.” - _
The Consol Energy Center and the Pitts-

burgh Penguins have become famous for their '

Student Rush program, which allows students

to get open seats to hockey games for af’dis- V

counted price of only $25. Unfortunatelyjthe

_ NCAA doesn’t allow any variations in ticket E

prices for the tournament. ,
For people interested in attending games
while the tournament stops in Pittsburgh, a

' small number of session tickets will be avail-

able rightbefore game day.

“Although we are technically sold out, once
teams return their unsold allotments, a limited
number of session packages will be sold the
day before _the games for $78 per session,”
Racicot said. V

And if $78 is too much money for a col-
' lege student, an open practice session with

free parking is planned to take place on the

- Wednesday before the tournament begins. I

basketball game at the Fitzgerald Field

‘House. The Panthers concluded the regu-

lar season 25-4 and won the first of three

was a season that ‘went beyond anyone’s
dreams and aseason that still looks rich
with promise, what with the Big East and
"NCAA Tournaments ahead,” Bob Smizik
wrote in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
March 9, 2002 .—- The Panthers fall in
double overtime to No. 19_ Connecticut in
the Big East title game. Two weeks later,
an ove-rtiine loss to No. 10 Kent State in
the Sweet Sixteen ends Pitt’s season.

March, 26, 2002 —— Pitt and Howland, '

named the Big East’s Coach ‘of the Year,
agree'to a contract extension through

the 2008-2009' season. The Post—Gazette

reports that the deal makes Howland the
highest—paid Pitt employee at a salary “in
excessof $700,000.” _

Nov. 23, 2002 — The Panthers open
the season ranked No. 5 andchristen the
Petersen Events Center with an 82-67
win over Duquesne. Pitt would spend the
entire-regular season ranked in the top
10 and would win its first 34 games at its
new home. ‘ ‘ . _ A

Jan.-_6, 2003 — Pitt thumps No. 5 Notre

. Dame, the ﬁrst of 12 straight top-10 3op—

ponents to lose at the Petersen Events

pionship. Knight battled an ankle.injury

: to start at point guard and score 16 points

“The only way to miss it would have been
ifl couldn’t walk.” 1 ‘ -

March 17, 2003 —-_ UCLA ﬁres Steve
Lavin. Howland downplays speculation
that hewill leave Pitt to coach the Bruins.
“I’m not planning on going anywhere,”

situation here.” -

scores 22 points, and his Marquette
Golden Eagles defeat Pitt’ 77-74 in the

Donatas Zavackas, the winningest senior
class in Pitt history to that point.

‘March 28, 2003 — Howland meets

with his Pitt players after visiting UCLA _

over the weekend. He backs off his earlier
comments,now stating he “iscompelled
to look at the potential opportunity.” Five
days later, he agrees to coach the Bru-
ins.

April 4, 2003 — The Post—Gazette
reports that the players want assistant

coach Jamie’Dixon tobecome the new '

head coach, but a‘ meeting with admin-

. istrators left them “to believe that Dixon‘
‘— a finalist at Illinois State and Wright

State, along with a candidate to join
Howland’s staff at UCLA —— isn’t a prime

I player in Pitt’_s national pursuit.” Then-

Memphis coach John Calipari’s name is

 

   

’ tossed about.

April 15, 2003 ’— After Wake Forest
head coach‘Skip Prosser spurns Pitt’s of-
fer in favor of a contract extension with
the Demon Deacons, the Panthers turn to
Dixon to lead the basketball program. He

RM: Leadership with this team starts
and ends with Travon Woodall.

TPN: What does the future hold?

RM: Improvement. They get Woodall
back for one more year and bring in two
highly rated guys in [Steven] Adams and
[James] Robinson. They needJ.]. Moore to

become an attacking—type scorer, which he ~

has the capability of doing.

TPN: Was this season an anomaly or .g

should Pitt fans be concerned?

RM: My guess is an anomalyi It couldn’t
last forever. Everyone has down years, and

this was the year that ‘it happened to Pitt. V

Next year will answer that question more
clearly, but I’d wager all of [head coach Ja-
mie] Dixon’s successful years are the norm
versus this poor one. '

TPN: Has Dixon’s system met its high-

est goals? _ 

RM: Not sure. I thought Sam Young was
the best player in collegebasketball his se-
nior season, and he accomplished that in
Dixon’s system. If anything, this season will
makejamie Dixon really take a look at every

part of his program and decide whether
he needs to make some changes to his sys—
tem, although he’s showed a willingness to
change defensively this year. His system
offensively actually results in high percent-
age shots when executed and also stresses
taking transition opportunities when they’re
available.

TPN: Can his system succeed in the At-
lantic Coast Conference against a different
style of basketball? *

RM: 1 think so. Again, i think Pitt nor—.

mally is ﬁne offensively.,I think defensively
is where things have fallen off the last three
years, to be honest.

TPN: Do you expect ]ames.Robinson

RM: Steven Adams will contribute right
away.]ames Robinson has a chance. Adams

. should be the foundation next year. He will

ﬁnish everything he gets close to the rim.
Robinson will probably get minutes similar
to what [Levance] Fields got his ﬁrst year.
He has a chance to be very solid and the next
really good point guard at Pitt.

RM: It has to be_].J. Moore or Lamar Pat-
terson. Pitt needs both to improve. It will
also be interesting to see Malcolm Gilbert’s-*5
progression. I thought they wasted what
could’ve been his redshirt year by not play-
ing him enough, which is too bad.

TPN: Do you expect to see any overhaul
with players in the lineup?

few years, and I think you’ll see it happen:
again. Not sure who, but there’s a few play-
ers who probably will be at different schools
next season. I

plaudits on the team’s way to an Ohio Val-
ley Conference championship and a 30-1
record. OVC Player of the Year Isaiah Ca-
naan and the rest of the Racers should be
fun to follow as they hope to repeat the
recent heroics of other small schools such
as Butler and Virginia Commonwealth and
make a run at the Final Four.

Marquette —— A few weeks ago, Golden
Eagles head coach Buzz Williams instantly
became a popular ﬁgure among Pitt fans

when he danced on West Virginia’s court V.
to the tune of “Take Me Home, Country

Roads” — the Mountaineers’ popular post-
game song — after his team pulled off a
tough road victory. He later apologized

for the action after WVU fans responded ’

angrily, but Marquette and its passionate
coach are still good candidates for Pitt fans
looking for teams to support in this year’s
bracket. ,

Davidson —- This Wildcats team isn’t
as dangerous as it was in 2008 when star

guard Stephen Curry nearly led Davidson .

to the Final Four, but it does have a connec-
tion to Pittsburgh in sophomore guard Tom
Droney. The Sewickley Academy graduate,

who won WPIAL and statechampionships .

in high school and drew interest from‘
schools like Pitt and Notre Dame before
signing with Davidson, plays solid minutes
off the bench for the Wildcats. __ S
The Bad ’
West Virginia — The most obvious team _
at which Pitt fanscan channel this season’s

frustrations is that of the Panthers’ hated .

rivals from Morgarltown. With West Vir-
ginia going to the Big 12 next season and
Pitt jumping to the ACC soon thereafter,
there’s uncertainty about whether the two
schools might be forced to stop playing each
other in both football and basketball. The
Mountaineers got the last laugh in both
sports this year,‘ but an early exit from the
NCAA Tournament by WVU would give Pitt
fans some joy. .
Kentucky — Even though the Wildcats

. have started ﬁve underclassmen all season,-

they will head into this year’s tournament
as the nation’s top team -following an un-

defeated Southeastern Conference regular V

season. Headicoach John Calipari recently
dismissed the notion that the Wildcats’ pro-

, gram takes advantage of the NCAA system

by recruiting athletes who plan on spend—'
ing asingle season at the school before

entering the NBA draft, but the fact that

Kentucky will likely ‘have’ an entire new
starting lineup next year speaks for itself.”
Fans who support Pitt’s style of develop-
ing and graduating players over four years
would likely love to see this year’s.tourna—

ment favorites fall short. f T _ -

The Ugly _ ' .~ » _

UNLV — For those of you who still feel
bitterly toward highly touted freshman
recruit Khem Birch, who unexpectedly
transferred from Pitt earlier this season,
look no furtherfthan UNLV for a target at
which to aim your anger. Just because the

c Canadian forward still can’t play for the

Runnin’ Rebels due to NCAA rules requiring
transfers to sit out a year doesn’t mean Pitt-
fans should exclude UNLV from their list
of teams to jeer.

gives 16 teams the opportunity to compete
in a postseason tournament. The three-
round tournament consists of the ﬁrst
round and the quarterﬁnals, followed by
the semiﬁnals in which the teams are re-
seeded. The ﬁnal round is a best-of-three
series held on March 26, 28 and 30.

Every game ofthe CBI isplayed on one
of the teams’ campuses, and coverage of
the entire tournament is available on HD-
Net. ' '

The Panthers last missed both the
NCAA Tournament and the NIT in the
2000-2001 season. I -

The right side of the CBI bracket fea-
tures Butler vs. Delaware, Penn vs. Quin-
nipiac, Princeton vs. Evansville and Wof-
ford vs. Pittsburgh. The left side of the
bracket has Milwaukee vs. TCU, Western
Illinois vs. Oregon State, Washington State
vs. San Francisco and North Dakota State
vs. Wyoming.

The bracket could provide a Pitt vs. But-
ler rematch in the semiﬁnals. The teams
met last season in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament, when Butler upset the
No. 1-seeded Panthers in a classic matchup
with a bizarre ending. This year, the stakes
wouldn’t be as high.

tournament championship in order to ad-
vance to the NCAA Tournament, a post-

A season result that has become the norm
in Pittsburgh over the past 10 seasons. But .

after a season during which the Panthers
ﬁnished 17-16 overall and 5-13 in Big East
play, the Big Dance was out of reach.

So the Panthers waited long past the
Selection Sunday special on CBS for a dif-
ferent selection show on ESPNU, but Pitt’s
name never appeared on the 32—s,eed lines
for the NIT, either. -

Founded in 1938, the NIT is the oldest
—' and perhaps most historic — college
basketball tournament in America. Reg-
u_lar—season conference champions who
don’t win their conference tournaments
are given an automatic bid to the field. This
season, those teams included Washington,
Savannah State and Bucknell.

Iowa, a team that had the same 17-16
record as Pitt, earned a No. 7 seed. The
Hawkeyes ﬁnished 8-10 in the Big Ten. The
Panthers had a Rating Percentage Index
ranking of 96, while the Hawkeyes’ RPI
was considerably lower at 130.

Iowa went 4-8 against RPI top—50 op-
ponents while Pitt went 1-9. NITology.com
projected the Panthers as a No. 7 seed in
the NIT. . ~

After Pitt lost to Georgetown in the Big
East tournament on Tuesday, members of
the men’s basketball team agreed that they
would play in the NIT, or any postseason
tournament, if they received a bid.

points, and John Johnson and j.]. Moore
each added eight points off the bench.
Dante Taylor ﬁnished with six points and

_Travon Woodall also scored six points while

dishingout six assists.
“I think we are about as healthy as we’ve
been,” Dixon said. “We have everybody

_ available.”

After falling behind by six points, 26-20,
with 5:15 left in the ﬁrst half, the Panthers
rallied back to close the half onan 13-2 run
and take a 28-33 lead into the break. St.

John’s freshman Moe Harkless said that .

the Red Storm started _to rush their offense
during that period.

“A lot of shots that we took during that
time were bad shots, and I thinkifwe would
have slowed down and took our time  we
would have been able to overcome that
hump,” he said.

The Panthers continued to stretch their

. lead after the break, starting the second

half with a 7-0 scoring run to push their
advantage to double digits, 43-32. St.John’s

“But right now, it’s all about this game and
how we feel after this one for us ...A -more
personally, I should say.- And I just felt we
were going to play better.i’...- ,

Georgetown head coachjohn Thompson
III said the Hoyas emphasized two areas
entering the game: points in the paint and
rebounding. ’

They won in both categories.

Georgetown out-rebounded Pitt 36-25

. and scored 28 points in the paint, compared

to the Panthers’ 20. Henry Sims dominated
for the Hoyas, scoring 20 points and grab-
bing 13 rebounds. ' _‘

“I think Henry has been pretty good
most the year,” Thompson said. “I thought
he was very good today in terms of his ef-
fectiveness on the block, his effectiveness
as a passer and his decision making.”

The game stood in stark contrast to the
Panthers’ ﬁrst meeting with Georgetown on

~ Jan. 28. The Panthers, then in the midst of
 a four-game winning streak, won that game
'—i-_A%ibyAbeating the Hoyas on the boards 35-23
A and shooting 52 percent for the game and

57 percent in the second half.

“Our zone was effective tonight,”
Thompson said on Wednesday, “The ﬁrst
‘time we played them, our back line wasn’t
good, and they. ended up with a handful of
layups. We were better tonight.”

In January, Pitt had no problem carv-
ing up Georgetown’s zone using solid ball
movement and penetration to ﬁnd solid

~lo.o_Vl_gs_ inside. The Panthers’ ability to ef-
fectively attackthe zone disappeared in

the second meeting, and as a result, they
took 21 threes and made just ﬁve.

‘ “That was a major focus, protecting
the paint,” Sims said. “Last game they
had layups and dunks — it seemed like all
theirapoints. We made sure we heldthat_ at
a minimum today.”

Pitt’s big men — Taylor, Talib Zanna
and Malcolm Gilbert — grabbed three total
rebounds. 3 .

“We never really_ got anyone going of-
fensively,” Dixon said. “We got off to a good
start early; I thoughtwe got some touches
inside. But as the game got going, we had
less success inside and less success in pen-
etration.”

Georgetown closed the ﬁrst half on a
16-2 run that transformed a 23-20 deﬁcit
into a 31-23 halftime lead. »

The Panthers started the second half
on a 6-0 scoring run as they ﬁnally worked

the ball inside for two Taylor layups and a ‘

short Robinson jumper. Thompson, who
switched to man-.to-man defense early in
the second half, quickly switched back to
zone to shut down the Panthers.

Then the H‘oyas responded offensively,
boosting the lead back to eight points with
two consecutive threes and effectively tak-
ing the ﬁght out of the Panthers for the rest
of the game. . - ,

“This is [the seniors’] last time to play
in the Garden in the Big East Champion-
ship,” Dixon said‘. “I know they wanted to
go out of here winning this thing, but we
came up short.” E -°

Big3East tournament, Taylor seemed to
sum up the issues that have plagued the
Panthers all season.

“They playedharder than us,” he
said of the Hoyas. “They were more
physical than us.” ‘ -

For a program that’s built its name
on toughness and defense, the decline
of those qualities has been especially
notable this season. Pitt redshirt sopho-
more Lamar Patterson said that next.
year, the‘Panthers have_to get back to
playing “Pitt basketball.”

Patterson added that he’s never ex-
perienced the kind of_ adversity on any
level that Pitt has faced this season.

“This is the worst a season has gone
so far in my life,” Patterson said. “This
is an experience hopefully wecan grow

from.”

As for the reason behind Pitt’s
struggles this season, Gibbs pointed
to injuries — especially to point guard -
Travon Woodall — as well the transfer
offormer starting center Khem Birch,
while also accepting some responsbil—

‘ ity himself. ' ‘

Whatever the reason for the di_sap-
pointments, the Panthers will settle for ,
getting their underclassmen experience
for next season, instead of competing
for a National Championship. g

She made one layup and then made "a
‘baseline ﬂoater, getting fouled on the play.

Letting loose a joyous scream, Kiesel’s
burst of emotion conﬁrmed what both teams
seemed to already know: Pitt wasn’t going

9 to fold.

“This was the hardest we’ve ever fought,”
she said. '

Kiesel made the foul shot pulling the game
within four, 52-48. ‘g - _“

After the game became tied at 55-55, the
two teams traded the lead back and forth.

With less than a minute to go and South

' - Florida behind 59-57, the Bulls’ Antlrell

Smith found herself alone on the baseline
and coolly made the three.

Berenato said a missed rotation caused
Smith to be wide open. ‘

‘_‘This was the"-
harolest we’\(_e ever
fought.”

—Brianna Kiesel ,

Down the stretch, Kiesel showed why
she was unanimously named to: the Big East
All-Rookie Team. "Fifteen of her team-high
24 points came in the second half as she led
the team’s comeback. . ’

Sophomore Marquel Davis gave Pitt a sec~
ondary offensive threat, scoring 13 points

and, perhaps more importantly, running the

point in the laterstages of the game. That
allowed Kiesel, who played 39 minutes‘, to
conserve her energy. .

With the game clock winding down, there .

was really no question who would take the
last shot: Kiesel. - _ : 7
She got the ball in the backcourt after

South Florida’s Shalethia Stringﬁeld missed ,

the front end of a one-and-one. \

Kiesel ‘used a Burdgess pick to create
space at the top of the key, drilibled to her
left, cut toward the basket and rose up.

= The shot looked good and seemed des-
tined to end Pitt’s misery and cap an improb-
able comeback, ‘but itrimmed out, and South
Florida held on-I-for; the win,

“I know you’re supposed to look at the
bright side, but I don’t see-one right now,”
she said. ‘

Kiesel tried to sum it all up. ‘ .

“I really thought we had this game. It’s
a tough loss. It burns for everyone,” Kiesel
said. ”Everyone felt this loss.”

Regardless, Berenato said she senses ‘
I something unique about her young team.

history. _ _ ' °
Earlier inthe year, Pitt dropped a70-62 game
away to Villanova but then came back to Pitts-

- burgh to be blown out by ‘Syracuse, 83-60.

“They had this thing where they would get
down by so much and then be able come back
and play in the second halfand do pretty we ,”
Price said. '

Two season-ending shoulder injuries to

players Cora McManus and Asia Logan added _

to the difficult task facing the Panthers.
Freshman shooting guard Loliya Briggs also

missed the entire season after injuring her knee

while playing with the Nigerian U19 national
team. Briggs was the highest rated recruit (No.
50) of Pitt’s 2011 recruiting class.

Berenato said Briggs, who-“was brought
in here to be a major—impact player” will get a

"medical redshirt if the request is approved by

the NCAA, meaning she will have four years of
eligibility beginning next season.

“You can’t plan on injuries,” Berenato said.

What does such a poor season mean for
Berenato? » '

Nothing quite yet. ~

But if the team doesn’t show improvement,
next year might be the beginning of the end of
the coach’s time in Oakland. ‘_

Berenato’s contract runs until the 2015-2016
season, and Voepel said schools don’t often buy

out coaches’ contracts in women’s basketball. ‘

Inthis particular case, Voepelthinks it is un-
likely that Pitt_will buy out Berenato given where
she’s taken the program in her nine years.

Before Berenato, the women’s program had
never received an NCAA bid. Under Berenato,
the team has enjoyed, until recently, an unparal-
leled period of success. The Panthers went to the
tournament for three consecutive years (2007
to 2009) and made Women’s NIT appearances
before and after, in 2006 and 2010.

“She’s been- doing this a long time,” Voepel ~

said. “I do think she knows what she’s doing.”

Zeise said that Berenato will get the oppor-
tunity to improve the team’s performance based
on her recent success. '

“Agnus, she’s done a good job here. She’s

done a good job of makingbasketballrelevant,”
Zeise said. “[The adrninstiration] has faith in
her. That’s the biggest thing. When you’ve had
success, they’re going to give her some. more

March .12, 2012 I The PiitNevvs I vvvvvv.pittnevvs.c0m

time to get this thing straightened out and,

turned around.” A

Given thatwomen’s basketball at Pitt doesn’t
garner much attention or support, Zeise said
that there isn’t immense pressure for a coach-
ing change. He added his agreement that the
adrninstration is unlikely to buy out Berenato’s
contract. V

“Next year these players have to take the
next step. They really have to take the next step,”
Z_eise-said. f‘There has to be some progress.
That’s what [the administration] will be looking
for — not necessarily wins and losses.

This year, Pitt became the -fourth Big East
team in the last 10 years to go 0-16. The longest
a coach lasted after a 0-16 season during that
timewas two years.

, 1

Providence College’s_Susan Yow resigned
after two consecutive winless conference sea-
sonsin 2002-2003 and 2003—20o4._ '

Zeise said that in order to improve next sea-

- , son, the team needs to utilize the weight room

to get stronger. '_

“If you look at what Big East teams look
like, they’re big and they’re strong,” he said.
“This team wasn’t exactly that,’ but of course
they’re young. You don’t expect them to be fully
developed. - .

1 “They got pushed around in every gam
that I watched, just about. Big East teams just
threw them around the lane and manhandled
them abit.” - ' '

Voepel and Price both said that the team’s
performance nextyearwill be crucialindeciding

whether or not Berenato retains her job.
“They need to show forward progress,”

-Price said. “Not just to improve, but to show
that they’re headed back in the right direction
A and that it’s not going to be long before they’re

challenginginthe conference and putting them-
selves in_the mix for'an NCAA bid.”
Zeise summed up the goal for next season
simply: The Panthers need topwin games.
“They need to show improvement next year,

- orthingswillstarttogetprettytight,”Berenato .

said. “Next year the seat would get extremely
warm. That’s just reality. That’s just how it is.”
With the season done, Ber'enato said there’s
only one  to do. '
“Now we just look to the future,” she said.
