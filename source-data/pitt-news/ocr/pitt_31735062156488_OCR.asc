Pitt Frosh Mayor
‘A Pitt freshman, Henry Adams,
has been Hill City’s mayor for
two years. _

The ‘purpose of the teen-age
government, complete from the
mayorqdown, is to try tocontrol
the district’s crime rate. I

If a juvenile, is caught commit-
ting .a misdemeanor such as petty
thievery, he or she is’ taken to Hill
City, ‘rather than a Pittsburgh po-
lice station. At Hill City the young
delinquent receives _a full and
fair trial from a judge and jury
close to his own age. If‘ found’
guilty, he’s put on probation for
some months and given work to
do for the organization.

lates this probation, he -is turned

Cut Out Words

Dr. Stuart added the observation
that-it never costs anything to cut
out words.

“I once cut a story down from
28 pages to six before I was able
to sell it,” he remarked. ‘

Mr. Selby noted that the rising
popularity of paper-backed novels
was certain to result in more read-
ing and consequently to have some
inﬂuence on the writer.

“Television, however, will be

even more inﬂuential,” Mr. Shaw 4

maintained. “TV is at present a
young medium for\yqung writers.”

Panel members, all top men in

different points. But all agreed
that the would-be writer must do

‘A Dr. Salk began his work in this

1942-1947. In World War II, the
A determined to
prevent a recurrence of the dead-

The key to the success of the

with mineral oil increased the

er and longer immunity than any

-In January, 1951, state senator
Albert Eechan introduced his so.-
called “Loyalty 'Oath” bill, a

‘ piece of legislation that now, in

amended form, is the law of
Pennsylvania.

The advocates of the Oath Bill
claimed t-h a t
it ‘would help
rid state sup-
ported institu-
tions of “sub-
versives.”
T h_e y denied

is the right to teach and learn
without fear of réprisal.
Although . the‘ ‘Pechan_ Bill
passed‘ the legislature, the re-
quirements concerning instruc-
tors in state supported institu-

tions were modiﬁed ‘greatly. Pitt‘

instructors, for example, do not,
as do regular state employees,
have to take an oath. Each in-

feet now for some time, an analy- .

“sis of its effectiveness and dan-
gers is no longer‘ a matter a pure
conjecture. ‘

1 The bulk of the evidence thus
far indicates that law has men-
aced academic freedom, while

‘ performing no 'desirable func-
ktion‘. \
At Pitt for‘ example, when the

Oath bill was ﬁrst introduced, the
Pitt News asked many students
and faculty their opinion of the
controversy. “Many refused -— to

.reply,’—’ the News Reporter said, _

“because they _were afraid the

‘question was too hot to handle.”

Menaces Freedom _
Such action »is illustrative of
the assertion that the Oath and
similar legislation. menaces aca-
demicfreedom, for what is there
characteristic of freedom in _a ‘bill

"ﬁlled with generalities. and be-

‘ clouded with righteous indigna-

tion. It will be, in short, another
indirect slur upon the character

.of. those who manage the Univer-

sity Food Service.
Harsh Statement

If this seems to harsh a state-
ment, let’s reﬁect on the fact that

in the past three years there‘

have been as many investiga-
tions of food quality and prices.
Each year ‘Miss Cramblett pa-
tiently explains why her food

. costs so ‘much and the investi-

gators go away only to soon re-
turniwith the same charges. It’s
as much as to.say, “We didn’t be-
lieve‘ you last time, M’am, so
would you please repeat your-
self?” ‘ - ,

But not "once has there been
an honest investigation,- which
entails a thorough check with
wholesale. houses on their cur-
rent prices, as '-close‘ a check as
can be_ made on the average
amount spent by student, an in-
vestigation on the wages paid to
the hired help, and a study of the

claim it would ruin‘ its beauty.

If, a building, using the same"

gothic architecture as the Ca-

lthedral, facing Fifth Avenue is

ugly’ then I am for more ugly
buildings on this campus.

Right now there is $2,500,000
in the kitty for a new science
h all lying around collecting
dust because there is no land
on which to build one.

Even if we did have money
for a Student Union there would
be no place to build it. There is
a lot of land in the city of Pitts-
burgh. But none of it is around
here. What good would a Union
do ten blocks down Fifth Ave-
nue when its main purpose is to
be the center of student life‘?
Chance Coming

Pitt is apparently attempting

tojchange itself from a “stree/.-.
‘oar college” ‘to a “campus col-
~legVe;” If the ~ pres

- about which many people_ are

afraid to talk about?

Writing in. the University of ‘
Pennsylvania Law Review, Prof.‘

Clark Byse reported that the
Loyalty legislation‘ had removed
no subversives from the colleges
or anywhere else, but rather only
caused the dismissal of several
Quakers and a few others -who
refused, because of conscientious

~ convictions, to take the oath or
to conform to other allied meas-
ures.

Backers of the Loylalty legis-

lation, which brings about con-
formity, notloyalty, could do well
to examine the words of George
Wharton Pepper, former U. S.
senator and clean of the Phila-
delphia Bar, who wrote:

0 “. i. . every communist to whom
the statute is intended to apply
will unhesitatingly take the pre-

scribed oath and ‘proceed with his '

subversive activities just as be-

fore. The other consequence [of
the,‘ Loyalty legislation] is ,, that_
people who, like me, are devoted‘

, heart and soul to our American

constitutional system and who
therefore lzalue the freedoms
which communism’ would" de-
stroy, will -for that reason refuse
to stake the oath’, lest’ its vague"

provisions be so construed, as to‘

limit‘ their own liberty to think
"and act as free‘.American citi-
zens.”

cost of overhead and mainte-
nance. ‘ '
No'|' Worthy

Then, and only then, can the

i.nvestigators truthfully say that H"

food prices are too high. Until
that -time, what they say is not
worthy of college students who
are supposed to have learned that
sweeping generalizations not on-
ly prove nothing but also serve
to muddy the waters.

There are those ofus who can’t .

afford to pay. the prices that are
.charged by the University Food

Service. ‘Admittedly, they are
high, but whether this is a result
of mismanagement or the high
cost of living, we are not pre-
pared to say.

In the absence of facts,
have only one alternative, and
that is to go elsewhere to eat
without complaining too much.
We suggest thatiour investigators
do likewise until they ‘are pre-
pared to spend a great deal of

time looking into the facts rather .

than mounting their soapboxes to

, gather votes or sell magazines.

Buildings

to go from building to building.
Granted every new building
thatis dreamed up couldn’t be
put on the lawn; but at- least two
could be ﬁtted in very com-
fortably. . .
It seems our only hope for ever
getting all the buildingswe need
so badly is to sit around and
wait for a few .of the buildings
ﬂanking the Cathedral to burn_
down, or for their present occu-
pants to move] But I am sure the

Board of Trustees has much bet- .

‘ ter prospects.

Speech Correction Job Advances;
‘Modern Courses 0ffere_{l_,at‘P.itt

. By BEA PAUL
Untila few decades ago, victims of speech defects, re-

sulting from cleft-palates, hair-lips, stammering, I.
’ were considered merely -unfortunate persons- During the

Here at the University, a ‘grad-
uate course in-Speech and Hear-
ing Therapy is providing students
with some of the most modern
speechucorrection training in the
‘country. . -

Intensive Courses

In general, students specializing
in_ speech correction take intensive
courses in anatomy, speech pa-
thology, psychology, and clinical
practice. In these courses students
not only learn the psysiology,4but

0 V the functions of the lips, tongue,"

and cheeek muscles in speaking.
If, in clinical work, thestudents

V ﬁnd a patient whose speech de-

feet is largely physical, they ‘are
taug t to administer speech ther-
apy ‘which consists of various
speaking exercises and drills.
Foriexample, a c1eft—palate is
a physical defect, which often
leads. to what the experts call
“speech sloppiness,” a condition
which is often exaggerated? by
laziness or. self-pity on the pa-

tient’s part. This is an occasion.

when the’ student must integrate
his knowledge of psychology in
treating. the patient by convinc-
ing' and encouraging the aﬂlicted
person. Speech therapists say this

and lisping

past ten years, however, interest in speech correction has
“grown so rapidly that many universities now oﬁer a com-
plete curriculum for those wish-9
‘ing to specialze in it.

n

is one of theihardest of all the
jobs in speech correction.’

Jobs Follow Degrees

After obtaining their degrees,
many speech therapists in the
Pittsburgh area are employed by
the Board of Education. In this
work, the therapist travels from
school to school and works with
the children once or twice a week.
The rest of the time, another
teacher. carries out the program.
Such a “shi_fting_plan”‘ is neces-
sary, since the demand for speech
correctionists is still greater than
the supply. H

Directing the Speech and Hear-
ing Clinic at Pitt is Dr. Jack Mat-
thews who also serves as head of
the University's Division of Psy
chological Services. ,

“Our program seeks-to help all
types of people with speech prob-
lems,” Dr. Matthews says.’ “We

Notable Successes

. The University of Pittsburgh"s
Speech Correction Clinic has had
many noteworthy successes in its
work. One such case is that of
the steel worker from Weirton,

blow across the throat in an acci-
dent at work. Though he could
only whisper as a result, doctors
said there was no real injury to
the throat. After a year and a half
of~hoarse' whispering, the victim-
was referred to the Pitt school,
where the steel worker regained
his normal voice in a few months.

And Engineers

A recent ' news release ' from
Martin R. Durkin, Secretary of
Labor, reviews the job outlook for
1953 college graduates.»

A breakdown of various em-
ployment ﬁelds is listed’. giving
the probable "needs for coming
years.

In the ﬁeld of engineering, states
the release, an average of 30,000
new engineers per year will be
needed. A shortage is expected to
continue for a number of years.

A demand for personnel in the
natural sciences has increased
sharply during the past two years.
As the defense program continues,
the shortage of workers will con-
tinue to exist. 0

Elementary school teachers are
in greater demand for 1953-54 than

for 1952-53. .Vacancies for high
school teachers are expected to

increase slowly over the next sev-'

eral years and reach ‘extremely
high levels near the ‘end of the
decade. _

Net Squad Opens

Suffering from lack; of practice
due to the cold weather, the net-

Two schedule changes have
been made: W 8: J,_ May 4 and
Indiana State Teachers, May 5.

at Mellon.

Schmitt is also a kicker. _
Promising Center

Both of last year’s regular cen-
ters, Stu Kline and Gabe Gem-‘
barosky, will have to be replaced
by new talent. Only one varsity
member. Bob Ballock, is available.

But the real eye—catcher of the
new crop of linemen, Ed Bose, may
solve the center problem with dis-
patch. The big, rugged type, Bose
comes to Pitt via the same route as
Kraemer—Great Lakes.
, Bose is expected to back up‘ the
right corner on defense, teaming
up with Bobby Epps and either
Blanda,_ Gatz, or Voytell, three
men with linebacking experience.

Outsider Mg}? Rate Nod

   OverField of 13 Alums

BY BORIS WEINST_EIN

. As usual Athletic Director Tom Hamilton is mum on
the possible successor to Dr. H. Clifford Carlson’s vacated
post as basketball coach. He prefers to let the reporters

 

blindly scratch around the district and county, ‘for that
matter, in what he terms “that “guessing game again.” -
_ Hamilton‘ took time out during last Tuesday’s meeting
to remind reporters in the Chancellor’s oﬁice that “you re-

porters will have no trouble se-
lecting a man for us.”

And just one day before the
Athletic Committee .begins screen-
ing for the head coaching position
15 candidates are in the -running,
according to the reporters.

‘ Only Two Outsiders

Of this list only two outsiders
are mentioned——Eddie Melvin, re-
cently ﬁred at St. Bonaventure,
and Ken Loeﬁler, coach at La
Salle.

Among the Pitt alumni ‘ who
have been mentioned in morethan
a breath are Charley ‘Hyatt, who
rates with the all—time greats, Clair
Cribbs, coaching in Bellaire, 0.,
and Dr. Skippy Hughes of «St.
Francis. All three were schooled
by Carlson. *

. This reporter’s opinion is that an
outsider will get the post, not a
Pitt man. First, it has been the
trend in recent years to ignore
alumni for athletic head coaching
jobs. A Therefore, nothing “much
will develop from tomorrow’s ses-
sion in the Chancellor’s office be-
cause only Pitt men will be inter-
viewed.

_ Why A Pitt Man?

Actually those interested alumni,
who are holding down high school

more than it deserves to be. ‘In
two years only one player - has
come here from schools coached
by these men. Why then should
they be considered for the’ post?
Secondly, only Hughes of the
three prominently discussed Pitt
men is in position to handle the
job. Hyatt is a salesman for "a
sporting goods concern in the west

coaching jobs, have neglected Pitt"

and has been out of basketball for
some time. Cribbs doesn’t have
the qualiﬁcations for the job.

Therefore, the ﬁeld is left open
to bring in a new personality who
has the qualiﬁcations and Stuff.
The two most recent head coaching
changes were in football when,-
ﬁrst, Len Casanova of Santa Clara
signed-and then two years later
Red Dawson of Michigan State
inked a contract.

Playﬁrﬁring
Set Next Week

Last Wednesday’s scheduled
playoff ﬁring ‘for the Greater
Pittsburgh Riﬂle League cham-
pionship has been postponed.

Sgt. Paul Bryan’s Panther
sharpshooters were all set to take
on the West Virginia Moun-
taineers for the title at the Wash-
ington & Jefferson range, but the
West Virginians failed to show up
for the meeting.

Pitt wound up the season at nine
wins -and a’ single loss with a vic-
tory over California State Teach-
ers' last Friday, thus knotting
WVU, who ended with a similar
mark. »

Wednesday’s ﬁring will be a re-
peat of last year’s playoff situa-
tion, when Pitt and the Mounties
had to schedule a playoff match.

But Pitt hopes", to reverse the
outcome this year and take the
West Virginians‘ crown.

Capt. ‘

\‘ '-

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

If all our idle thoughts were thrown together the con-
glomeration wouldn’t resemble Aunt Mary’s alphabet soup

but . . . idlethoughts.

_ So when we discuss Sarge Mitterling’s‘ baseballers, and
a discard from football camp, or something Doc Carlson told
us,"the result of the whole thing is still . . . idle thoughts.

And then from behind closed

e that Athletic Director Tom
Hamilton was more than a
' football coach and a baseball-
player. He, too, was a basket-
'ball coach of sorts by his own
admission. It was during his
service on the U. S. S. Enter- .
prise that Captain Hamilton
coached the Enterprise Whites."
How did he do? “Well every-
thing was all right,” he recalled,
“until action ceased between the

doors came. the announcement

   

Hamilton Reynolds‘

Blues, Reds, and Whites. We were called the Dirty Whites when it

was all , over.”

Trainer Roger. McGill had an interesting" tale  throw around
about Billy Reynolds. Itéwas diiring Pitt_’s Southern trip and Rey-
nolds was in center ﬁeld against Ft. Eustis. » '  __ ’ .

Billy moved in for a batted ball andwsuddenly stumped into

E. a hole, lost his balance and dropped his head. The ball hit Billy

‘square on the noggin and caromed high into the air. No, it
.wasn’t a lost ball for Leftﬁelder Bob Kyle waltzed over tomake

the catch. Give Billy‘ an assist, please. '

Everything seems to be in shape for the-Old-Timers Game
set for May 9 since athletic officials were able to get the old men
insurance. For severaliweeksi it was doubtful if Pitt would chance

a game without insurance.

The chance of injury is certainly increased whena football team
takes theiﬁeld after only one or two days practice. But now the
scene is set for the Old-Timers to get their brains knocked in—but

with insurance, of course.

Don’t fret over the future of Doc Carlson for already. be has
planned a, time-table. There’s a book on’ “Functional Health” that
must be completed, banquet engagements that must_ be ﬁlled, and‘ an
occasional‘ meeting that the good Doétor has promised to attend.

But the big job probably will be at his Ligioner home where
,60,'000i evergreens await his professional touch. '

Golfers Lose Third Straight. .

Coach Dave McCormack’s golf-
ers host West Virginia at Shan-
nopin Country Club this after-
noon still looking for their ﬁrst
win of the season.

The latest defeat handed the
Panthers was a 6-1 lacing from
Penn State at State College. Pre-
viqusly Navy and Georgetown de-
feated Pitt, 9-0 and 8-1 respec-
ﬁVé1y. I \

Pitt already has lost ‘two more
._games thanlit did during the en-

tire season last year.

_'Only Panther winner was vet-
eran Dick McCarthy who regis-
tered a 4-3 win on a windswept
course. Previously undefeated Phil
Hubacher dropped his match for
his first loss.

* . Gittlen_, Penn State sophomore

from Harrisburg posted a par 69
for medalist honors. -

Today Pitt will be" favored to
cop its ﬁrst win, /however, West
Virginia puts’, its best team on the
greens in many years.
