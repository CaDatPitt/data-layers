  Affect Travel Abroad.

by SI-IERYLL ZIPPAY
Travelers, particularly those belonging to the “Jet Set,” may
find themselves beset with restrictions as they plan their excursions

Is Pleasant Vacation Spot

The Land of the Rising Sun
may be the perfect place to
spend your summer vacation.
Daniel Pfeifer, Japanese instruc-
tor at the University, thinks so
after living in Japan for over
four years. The land is easily
accessible because of the ﬁne
transportation system, which is
better developed than our own.
The major cities are linked by
modern trains which travel over
1000 miles per hour.

Pfeifer reports that the cost
of traveling and acommodations
are reasonable. Bargains may
be found in cameras, tape re-
corders, and watches.

Japan has much to offer in
the way of recreation. There are
moutain slopes with very good
skiing, deserted beaches which
surround the islands and good
for swimming, ﬁshing, and skin
diving. Hiking and bicycling are
other popular Japanese sports.

Pfeifer spent two of his four
years in Japan teaching English
at Kochi University in Shikoku.
He is presently teaching the Ja-
panese language and literature
the University.

“Food is no problem," says

-Pfeifer. “Western Food is serv-

ed almost everywhere, but some
of the native delicacies such as
octopus and seaweed should not
be miss .”

The Japanese enjoy meeting
Americans, he points out, and
enjoy practicing their English
on visitors. The language bar-
rier should not prevent the vis-
itors from seein-g all of Japan
or from learning some of the
customs.

Fowler explained that the
goal of the package is not re-

to cut the amount actually spent
by each foreign traveler.

ed penalties are:

Israel Celebrates

Twentieth Anniversary

In the summer of 1967, hundreds of American and Canadian
youths visiting Israel enthusiastically offered their services to the
young nation in the emergency before its swift victory over the sur-
rounding Arab countries.

In the summer of 1968, hundreds of college students will again
converge on Israel, but this time their volunteer services will be
offered under less perilous conditions. They will help celebrate
Israel's 20th anniversary.

They will visit Israel as participants in a youth program spon-
sored by Histadrut, Israel’s/Federation of Labor, in order to promote
understanding between American and Israeli young people.

This popular program for college students is a seven and a half-
week kibbutz and vacation program, which winds up with visits to
several European countries.

This program has been praised by Prime Minister Levi Eshkol
of Israel as an effective way to encourage friendship between Israeli
and North American youth. More than 900 college students from 60
campuses in the United States
and Canada have participated

in the program since its incep-
tion in 1963.
Citizens of the United States

 and Canada, between the ages
of 18 and 25 are eligible for en-
rollment in the Kibbutz Vaca-
tion Program. Included in this
trip is a complete tour of Is-
rael. The students who partici-
pate will have a chance to meet
the people of Israel and to un-
derstand the problems that be-
set this tiny country.

 

According to Newsweek Magazine (Feb. 19, 1968) the President
has decided to cure the nation’s balance-oft-payments deficit by cut-

The tourist tax package was presented by Treasury Secretary
Henry H. Fowler to the House Ways and Means Committee and was
graduated to hit hardest at the biggest spenders. Low budget travel- ’

extended to international ﬂights
and temporarily tacked onto sea
travel.

> Tourist spending in Euro-pe,
Africa, Asia, and most of ﬁe
Paciﬁc would be tax-free up to
$7 a day per traveler. The next ,

$8 would be taxed at 15 per cent, ,
and any spending over $15 a 5’
day would be taxed at 30 per 1

cent.

of goods into the country tax
free would have the exemption
reduced to $10.

>A ﬂat duty rate of 25 pésr ’

cent would be levied on a re- -
turning traveler's purchases up
to $500.

Before leaving on a hip“: f

traveler would be required 
declare the funds he was taking,

with him and pay the full taxi
he estimates he will owe. i.

If enacted, the tourist pack- -

age, plus the President’s previ-
ous plea for “voluntary re-

straint” in travel, would hope- ,

fully save the country $500 mil-
lion. '

Such a package has already
had its effects in the tourist
travel industry. Nearly‘ every
travel agent reached by News-
week bureaus across -the US last
week reported at least a few
cancellations. Many agents and
economists Wonder whether

economic cure might prove

worse than the disease.

For example, several foreign
countries stand to lose money
from US restrictions on travel.
They were already hinting at re-
taliation. There is also the pos-
sibility of citizens
ways of getting around the pro-
posed tax.

‘F Travel in Europe can be

quite inexpensive if‘ a stu-
dent takes advantage of the
fact that he is a student.
Students may save hund-
dreds of dollars through
student discounts on food, lodg-
ing, and transportation. In many
cities students receive discounts
on concerts, movies, and thea-
ter performances.

Richard Tillinghas-t, a former
editor of Let’s Go, Harvard's
student guide to Europe, says
the main savings come from the

{Q special student facilities run by
European universities and gov-
ernments. There are national
student travel bureaus that can

’ give help and advice and pro-
vide room and ‘board through
their student restaurants and
hostels, and they sponsor cut-
rate student ﬂights and train
grnups; - .

Tillinghast suggests that if
students want to take advantage
of these opportunities, they

need an International Student .

Identity Card. These cards are
available from the United States
National Student Association
T (NSA), 265 Madison Ave., New
4 “York, N. Y. 10016. Before mak-
ing the ﬁnal plans for the trip,
consult the NSA’s Student Trav-
el—Europe. This is a book list-
ing vital information concern-
ing special ﬂights, bus and train
trips with prices averaging one-
third to one-half of the commer-
cial rates. The book is available
from the NSA for $1.95, after
March 1. ’

»‘ For people who enjoy a leis-
urely pace, once they get to Eur-
ope, cycling may be prescribed.
Bicycles can be purchased or
rented cheaply anywhere in Eur-
ope. The British Isles has a ﬁne

_ set up of youth hostels and is
well suited for cycling.

Probably the .most popular
way of getting around Europe
is ‘hitch-hiking. It's free, of
course, and it gives students 9.
chance to know many people or!
the‘ countries through which
they are traveling. It's also a
good way to practice a foreign
language. When hitch—hiking it
helps to carry a small sign stat-

ing your destination and to have

a miniature American ﬂag sew-

ed on your ruck-sack. Tilling-

hast also informs us that the
best in hitch-hiking can be found
in Great Britain, the LowCoun-
tries, and Scandinavia. It can be
unrewarding in Southern Eur-
ope. It should also be noted that
it can be quite dangerous for
girls to -go hitch-hiking ‘sin-gly.

F riendliness

Adana, the third largest city
in Turkey, located 20 miles from
the beautiful Mediterranean Sea,
is a city of quaintness and uni-
queness. Adana and the area
around it has much to offer.

When visiting Adana," be sure
to be there in time for the Ra-
mazon Festival. Here, after
weeks of fasting, a huge feast
and carnival is held. Barbecued
lamb and “rocky,” a clear white
liquor which tastes like licorice
and is quite potent, is served.

The charm and the hospital-
ity of the Turkish people have
no-t changed for-c_e‘nturies. Belly
dancing, shish ka-bob, and stuff-
ed grape leaves can still be con-
sumed by the famished traveler.
There are many sidewalk cafes
and night clubs which line the
main avenue, and something is
always happening in this very
old city with many new ideas.

London Swings

Carnaby Street Has Mod Looki

Swinging London is no-
thing new, but the descrip-
tion still applies. The city
swings as no other place in
Europe, and the action in
1968 promises to be as lusty
and lively as ever.

Outsiders who want to get in
the swing in a hurry can take
a=London tour‘ which covers

bars and boutiques, beat clubs

and casinos, op and pop art gal-
/leries. The big scene, of course,
is Carnaby St., home of the Mod,
rivaling the Tower for top place
on the sightseer’s circuit. Here
are the dolly-bird.s in their mini-
miniskirts, the beatle boys in
their vinyl vests and the gear
shops with their monkey furs,
granny shoes, George Raft la-
pels and fashions of the thirties.

No matter what the season,
the Vitality of London dazzles
tourists and natives alike. The
pursuit of pleasure is an around-
the-clock affair in hundreds of
pleasant pubs like the Magpie
and Stump across from Old Bail-
ey, the Lamb and Flag in the
theater district, the Mayﬂower
near the pier from which the
Pilgrims sailed, the Victoria
with its Gay Nineties decor, and
the Sherlock Holmes with its
s-ouvenirs of the great detective.

Everywhere, too, are night-
clubs appealing to every type
and taste. There are the old fav-
orites like Churchill's and the
Embassy, and new ones like
Raymond's Revue Bar with its
startling striptease. Discothe-
ques at every turn give out
with the big beat. Notable are
such jet set favorites as Amia-
bel’s, Dolly's and the Scotch.
Bla.ise’s at Queensgate features
swinging combos in one room
and gaming tables in another.

When it comes to gambling,
London rivals Las Vegas. The
Victoria Sporting Club, largest
of all, offers everything from
roulette to kalooki. The law says
the casinos must give the gam-
bler an even break, so there is
no house percentage and prof-
its are made on drinks, food
and a fee for sitting in on the
game. Crockford’s, set in a 19th
century ducal town house above

L

i\    . 

ALL SIGHTSEEING tours of London include a stop at the famous
clock, Big Ben, while the passengers, inadvertantly, check their

watches.

«the Mall, charges an overseas
membership fee of $8.40. Stakes
range from as low as 30 cents
to a high of $560, and there’s ac-
tion aplenty from two in the
afternoon until dawn’s early
ﬁght

The aura of opulence and
good living so typical of the
new London has spread to the
kitchen, and English cookery
has become a ﬁne art. The tea
shops have improved, the small-
est bistros have ﬁne wine lists,
and a superb meal can be had
for as little as $3.50. The ﬂash-
ionable hour for lunch, inciden-
tally, is 1 p.m., and dinner be-
gins around 8:30.

Anyone who prefers the leis-
urely pace of the 18th century
to the action of Swinging Lon-
don can take a three-day trip by
stage coach from London to
Stratford-on-Avon. The coach,

complete wih footmen and high-
hatted out-rider stops en route
at Windsor Castle, Eton, Ox-
ford and Blenheim Palace. Strat-

ford itself offers six plays by,

the Bard, and Director Karlosf
Koun of the Greek Art Theater
is to do a long awaited version
of Romeo and Juliet.

Traveling by rail is pop-ular
among economy-minded tourists
for sightseeing through Europe.

Among the various railroad
plans, a Eurailpasvs is one of
the most economical. A Eurail-
pass can be obtained only in the
US through travel agents. The
pass is used for unlimited ﬁrst-
class travel throughout 13 coun-
tries. For instance‘, a 21-day Eu-
railpass sells for $110, a month's
travel will cost $140, two month's
$180.

If you are traveling in Bri-

tain, you can buy a BritR;"‘,_,

Pass for $50 from British Rail-
International. It lets you travel
wherever you like in Britain
within a period of 15 days. An-
other rail plan for seeing Bri-
tain is ThriftRail Coupons. For
$30 it gives you up to 1,000
miles of train travel with no
time limit.

Tourists Obtain Bargains in

by ALAN E. BARR '

More than anything else, Ti-
juana, Mexico, is a place for
bargains. Our shopping was lim-
ited more by storage space in
the car than by our wallets. In
one of the ﬁrst shops I entered,
I saw a wooden, hand-carved
statue of Don Quixote that
stood about 14 inches high.

“How much?” I asked. The‘

clerk said $4. I began to s.ay no
thank you when he lowered his
price to $3.50_. I realized what
was happening and offered him
$1. After a little bargaining, the
clerk and I agreed upon $2.25.
Before I. paid, the clerk okayed
the sale with the owner in Span-
ish. At opposite ends of the
shop, they had to shout at the
top of their lungs.

Most of our purchases were
éiﬁeartor items: bull horns,
w- en In5‘3i’k§, -ma -“s't'o'rre ‘book-
ends. Generally, we only paid
about 25 per cent of what the
items sell for in the States.

The shopping area reminded
me of an American downtown

section waiting for urban re-
newal. The stores were an old,
small, and none of the fronts
matched. There were no large

department stores.

After crossing the border, we

we found that our coverage was
not good in Mexico. It cost us
about $3 for a day-long policy.

There can be no doubt that
jet airliners, with their six-
hour flights from New York
to Seattle, fill a need for
harried business and com-
mercial travelers. But to see
the country, the best meth-
od of travel is by train.

A VIEW OF San Francisco shows a trolley car, Fisherman's Wharf;

 
  

While it takes two days to
journey from Chicago t-o Seat-
tle by train, during that time
the passenger can view sights
such as the Columbia River,
Glacier National Park, or the
Cascade Mountains of Washing-
ton.

Contemporary trains offer the
traveler a selection of accom-

and Alcatraz.

Visitors’ Service Provides
Specials in San Francisco

College groups planning to
visit San Francisco can plan
their trip the easy way by con-
tacting the San Francisco Con-
vention and Visitors Bureau.

For several years n-ow the
Bureau has provided a gratis
Group Visitor Service for all
groups traveling together and

Visiting the Bay city.

Whether the trip is to hear
the San Francisco Symphony
orchestra, to visit on of three
museums, or just for entertain-
ment, the Bureau can save col-
lege travelers time and money

by arranging group rates at -ho-

‘tels and motels, and special

group discounts for certain of
the city's attractions. The Group
Visitor Service also covers res-
taurant reservations and the
procurement of tickets for local
events ranging from opera to
basketball.

To take advantage of this
free service, interested ' groups
should contact the San Francis-
co Convention and Visitors Bu-
reau, Fox Plaza, San Francisco

Scholarships
Provide New
Opportunities

The Cultural and Educational
Exchange Committee offers an
unique travel scholarship pro-
gram to University students.
Ten scholarship-s are offered an-
nually to be used in countries
such as France, Italy, Lebanon-
Syria and Poland. The program
is directed primarily to under-
graduates in their junior year
and allows them -to follow their
own summer plan at foreign in-
stitutions_ ,

The Summer Study Abroad
Scholarships are sponsored by
the Nationality Rooms commit-
tees. Throughout the year these
committees hold fund-raising
events which build up their
scholarship accounts.

Students who went abroad
last summer brought back many
memories of exciting experi-
ences, people and places. One
student had the opportunity of
visiting Greece shortly after the
military coup. Another student
was in Israel when the Seven
Day War broke. Once she had
to take cover when an ammuni-
tion dump exploded near her.

Last year the students from
the University were lucky in be-
ing in t'he_right places at the
right time. You too can have the
opportunity of participating in
something really worth while
and no less exciting. This pro-
gram is open to all students
who have completed ﬁve trimes-
ters at the University.

which is equipped with a bar)
and two dining cars. The ﬁrs-t of
these, the “Ran-ch Oar,” serves
sandwiches, h-ot meals, and bev-
erages at bargain prices, while
the dining car specializes in
Montana sirloin steaks with
quality .and prices comparable
to most ﬁne restaurants.
Aside from the ﬂne scenery
and accommodations, trains o -
fer the traveler an opportu.nK§'
to meet and talk with people
from all over the United States,
and frequently from abroad as
well. In the dome and lounge
cars of luxury trains, the at-
mosphere is informal and peo-
ple talk freely. Because of the

leisurely pace of the train, ten-

sion seems to vanish.

_Besides Western trains like
the “Empire Builder,” there are
also trains in our part of the
United States that provide inex-
pensive and comfortable service
to cities like Chicago, Washing-
ton and New York. On the
Washington to Chicago run, ;
best kn-own train is the Balti-
more and Ohio’s “Capitol Limit-
ed,”. the only train in the East
with a dome lounge car.

The “Capitol,” which passes
through Pittsburgh at 11:20
p.m. on its trip to Chicago, also
includes at the rear an observa-
tion car with a bar-lounge
equipped with wall-to-wtall car-
peting and plush sofas and
ch-airs.

The “Capitol” includw sleep-
ers, inexpensive private- room
Slumbercoaches (private bed-
rooms at coach fares), regular
coaches (with reclining seats),
and a diner. Naturally, the or

on the “Capitol,” like all 1 - :

ularly scheduled passenger cars
in the United States, are fully
air-conditioned.

The “Empire Builder” and the
“Capitol Limited” are only two
of the mo-re than 900 daily inter-
city trains running in this coun-
try. To see the USA, comfort-
ably, and with little expense
travel by train.

room)—plus a special book of dis-
count coupons. .

made up?

Definitely not. You decide what cities

» . ,. ,\

After you do, see your travel agent. He'll
give you vouchers good for your hotel,
breakfast, and sightseeing in each city you
visit. And bonus coupons good for sav-

A word about the sightseeing. In 11 of

the right to take them as often as you like.
In the other 13 cities, you get the one
major tour. , V

basing fare. Which means your jetfare,
rooms, breakfasts and sightseeing for two
weeks can cost just $371 complete from

One last thing. We've also got a "Europe

For generations Rome, Paris, and London have en-
joyed a reputation as being the top cities_ for Americans
to visit. Now, Amsterdam may be ranking among. the
best for its warmth, hospitality, and night life. 

At onetime Amsterdam and all of Holland, for that i
matter, could be summed up with tulips, windmills, dikes,

and a quick das-h to the Rijks
Museum for a glimpse of Rem-
'brandt’s “Night Watch." Ams-
terdam received the “once over
lightly” treatment. This attitude
has changed. ’

Consider the fact that Ams-
terdam has more miles of - ca-
nals than Venice, more bridges
than London, and mo-re Dutch-
men than Hoboken, N. Y. Ams-
terdam al-so h-as the largest sin-
gle collection of Van Gogh
pta.intings—-517. ’ 1

What you probably didn’t
know about Amsterdam, is that
it’s perfect for a college student,
even a student with no money.
Living expenses are consider-
ably cheaper‘ in Holland than in
-America (including restaurants
and hotels). There are many

night clubs and cabarets geared,

to the college student. Both jazz
and rock are played widely, and
formal pop concerts are per-
formed regularly in Amster-

A dam’s Grote Zeal (Great Hall).

Culturally, Amsterdam is abun-
dant. If you are thinking about
going to Amsterdam, plan to be

- there in ‘June and July. Every

year at this time is the Holland
Festival, wh-ere numerous con-
certs, openas, ballets and plays

are performed. The Staqltgi,-l.1',i.l.«-ﬁg

Museum in Amsterdam disiﬁias
much modern art and the Rijs
Museum has a ﬁne collection-if
17th century paintings, medit-
al art, and, of course, may
Rembrandt masterpieces. 1.1
Amsterdam there is also Re-
brandt’s house, which is operio
the public, with many drawirs
and sketches on displiay.s* ,

* tion on this exciting city 3.1 T

Hosteling Makes Traveling Unique, Inexpensive

Hosteling is the unique
wayto travel here and.
abroad, meet new people,
see new places, and escape
the trappings and burdens
of modern living. Biking,
hiking, canoeing, skiing, and us-
ing low cost hostel accommoda-
tions can be found throughout
the world.

A uniform plan of world trav-
el was developed so that mem-
bers of each youth hostel asso-
citaion could travel freely from
country "to country and stay in
hostels everywhere. Each coun-
try agreed to recognize the mem-
bership card of all the others
and to adopt standards of health,
sanitation and safety.

Today there are more than
100 hostels in the United States

with hostel associations in 41
countries throughout the world.
In the US last year there were
more than 35,000 young Ameri-
canslin the American Youth
Hostel (AYH) organization.
AYH has 25 councils through-

out the country, carrying out i
‘the aims and purposes of the

organization. In the US the hos-
tel movement has no govern-
ment support, but abroad many
of the countries support the
movement. Consequently hos-
tels abroad are more numerous
and are located in many out-of-
the-way places.

Hostel membership is open to
all regardless of race, color or
creed. In the US, rates for a
room range from $1.50 to $2 per
night in big city hostels. Abroad,
the overnight fees range from

as low as 40 cents to'$1 per
night.

Passesyare valid for one year.
Youth passes for those under
18 years of age sell for $4; Sen-
'ior Youth passes (18 to 20 years)
are $6. Adult passes are $7 and

family passes (including chil-
dren) are valid in the US and
Canada and cost $9.

swers to your questions, write

Travel Department, 20 West
17th St., New York, N. Y. 10011.
