work on. the part of ‘all members

of the organization will continue

He is Siebert A. (Doc)

guilty conscience will never be

quiet. Doc just must keep going
or someone will -ﬁnd him out.

EVER before in history has so
much dirty work been pulled

in the interfraternity sweepstakes '
as this year, papers say. That is

interesting. A greater number of
seniors are in the race than ever

before. ‘Seniors just will be diifer- -

ent even if it comes to spiking a
third baseman or putting arsenic
-in the Phi Delt’s coffee. We didn’t
learn that from Goethe. '

It takes heart to win a sweep— ‘I

stakes. Two pounds of opium, one
of ‘laudanum and a Linhart lec-

ture are not as exhausting..

had the feeling of having; pulled

' Name a man whose feelings can’t-
be hurt and we will show him’ this

lege women when they‘ literally

not enough now. Senior men no
longer are safe with their Mail
Pouch with girls who are desperate
enough to catch colds deliberately
to place in the expectoration heats.

Fair referees can’t control ex-
cited spitters. Winifred McClure,
senior court gavel wielder, reports
demands for higher wages ontheir

.part. While Lilliam (Toots) Kirsch,

also athletic, says “give them. high-

Student Council, practiced with his
paternal grandfather’s ‘ walking

senior sticks which never came.

Wise Scotchman viewing Brady

ed in canes, will turn to love. Stu-

will aid him.

But Goldman Swish, dental gas
manufacturer and wise business
man, reports ﬁnancial chaos for
his extensive companies ~..\if Pitt
dentists are like- Davis. "'2-Davis,
looking on his “line” with feeling
of pride, says, “I learned it all in
Student Council.”

ISTORIC HOUSE 1, in Frick
Acres, ‘will’ no longer house
Pitt activities. That is sad. Seniors,
thought historic landmark would
never depart -in such prosaic fash-
ion. Says Bob Brinker, senior ball
chairman: “The rear orch on
House 1 is my ideal setting for a
date.” _
John B. Benkert, "also senior,
“I never date.” ‘ -
That is wise. Men who never
date can expect happy and long
life. Says Mike Getto: “Man,
how "long it WILL seem.” Getto,
accomplished artist on the chalk-
lined ﬁeld, never diagnosed an op-
ponent’s plays with keener insight.

ENIOR co-eds took advice Cap
and Gown offered; over seventy
per cent are wearing pajamas.
Mabel Forrest, senior, heartily en-
dorses them, saying: ,

‘While I realize the worthlessness
of testimonials, I’ll give one for
pajamas, the only bedroom wear
for women.. Many’s the time I
have become so enveloped in an old
fashioned . nightgoWn_ that ,I’ve
missed an eighty-thirty class sepa-
rating, myself from it.” *

Says Aidee Liotto: “With pa.-
jamas on,- I feel like a ﬁreman.”

Miss Klark: “Pajamas always
make me feel so mVannish.”l

morning, the thirty—third annual

get away to a brushing start.

Brooms, mops and brushes will be

are heavily favored as the steaks to
be pushed. Gammon’s “small steaks”
also have their followers. Brushing
away from Thaw Hall, the contest-

MOSCOW, May 31.-—Josef Stalin,
dictator of the Union of Socialist
Soviet‘ Republics, stated in an ex-
clusive interview to a representative
of this paper here last ,night that
S. H. “Sam” Williams, professor of
zoology‘ in the University of Pitts-
burgh,1w.as one of the best workers
in behalf of\ thetSoviet in the United
States. '

"THE BIG COMMUNISTIV

‘Williams, who has apparently
been?-one of the most noisy.“Red
Baiters” in America, shouting the
nightmare of “Bolshevism” in all
discussions, is in reality an enthusi-
astic sympathizer of Communism,
and a paid agent of the Soviet, ac-
cording "to Stalin. The Pitt profes-
sor has gained more support for the
Soviet regime by‘ his exceedingly
clever method of propaganda than
all other agents of the Moscow gov-
ernment in America, Stalin stated.

WASHINGTON, D.— C., May 31.—
Investigation before the Federal
Trade Commission here late yester-
day afternoon exposed a huge ath-
letic monopoly at the University of
Pittsburgh. Carried on under the
guise of the « “Pittsburgh ‘Scheduling
Corporation,” this powerful agency

' which has operated from coast to

coast for the past two years was
brought to light following the testi-
mony of several men prominent in
Pennsylvania public affairs.
Testimony during the course of
the‘ investigation '-brought out the
fact that the Pittsburgh Scheduling
Corporation was organized Septem-
ber 28, 1927, for the purpose of
‘booking leading attractions to face
the University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball team, known in sportingvrealms
as -the Pitt‘ Panthers, in games
which they hoped would attract ca-
pacity crowds to the Pitt stadium.
The Pitt stadium seats nearly
80,000 people, according to members
of the corporation, who openly ad-
mitted that it was their chief aim
at the time of organizations to fill
the huge Panther bowl every Sat-
urday during the football season.

FRANK MECCA TESTIFIES

Following this introductory ma-
terial at the ‘hearing, the bombshell
of the afternoon ‘came when W. D.
Garrison, supposed Pitt athletic
monarch, openly admitted that he
was the main gun in the exposed
ring and was acting under orders
from the Pitt Athletic Council and
the"Fetchun1 Company, Inc. Ac-
cording to f Garrison, ‘.‘Well boys,
you have me in a tight place and'1
guess I might as well come clean.
I have often said that if there was

‘anything wrong in the Pitt ath-

letics I would be the ﬁrst one to
come out with the truth.”

He continued, “During the ﬁrst
year of operation we were forced to
content ourselves with bookings
with Thiel, Allegheny, Grove City,
and other local teams, but ‘during
the following year we broadened
our scope and with additionalcapi-‘
tal succeeded in scheduling such~
teams as Nebraska, Carnegie Tech,
West Virginia and Wash-Jeff."

“Our most recent accomplishment

‘in the scheduling fieldf came when

we arranged three year pacts with
Notre Dame and Nebraska, anda
two year agreement with the fa-
mous Army team.”.He' concluded his
testimony for ‘the day’ by admitting
that his company was dickering for
the stupendous task of billing the
powerful Duquesne "University
eleven."

GARRISON SOBS. AT HEARING

Noted congressmen, who. were
brought in and cross-examined, ad-
mitted that they were part of the
Scheduling Corporation and claimed
that their company had-boasted that
they could schedule any football

team in the country, from Geneva

College to Notre Dame, for any
school which was willing to pay the
necessary commission.

. They averred, “We realized the
diﬂ.‘ir:ult job many schools had on
their hands -to pay off the bonds on
their stadiuin and “organized the
company, not to gain ‘control of the
football market, but merely as an
aid to present. day society. By
bringing outstanding football teams
together M3 assured our patrons of
capacity crowds, necessary to make
large stadiums pay.‘ We used no
foul or illegitimate methods ‘in our
operations and our books stand open
for inspection by anybody.”

The Federal VTrade Commission
failed to see the viewpoint of the
defendants and following a short
discussion of the case ordered the
dissolution of the Pittsburgh Sched-
uling Corporation on the grounds
that it was contrary to the general
welfare of modern business in as
much as it stiﬂed competition in
the booking of athletic contests.

 

‘‘There’s no back seat driver in
our car,” he boasted.-

“So, your wife always is at the
wheel when you go riding, eh?” sar-
castically retorted the other married
one.”

Following an engagement at Kim-
mel*s hot dog stand, Kay Kyser’s
discordant ﬂute blowers will enter-
tain with “before the war” ballads

at the dry-grass shuffle tonite. Im-
ported from Edgewood, where they
became stranded, the band con-

sented to play at.a reduced price of

$1,000 orchestra. “After the Ball,”
“Break-the News to -Mother,” that
“W'e,Had a Hot Time Tonight,”
with’ Teddy Joyce will be among
evening’s”fe‘atures tonite. . "

 

PITTSBURGH, Pa., May 31.-—
(Specialist to Pittsburgh. Roost)——
Men’s Interfraternity Council at the
University of Pittsburgh is one of
the hardest bodies to rule on the
campus. ‘. _

This is veriﬁed by the fact that
in the «past year it" has been neces-
saryto have three presidents, three
vice presidents, three secretaries,
two treasurys and two faculty -ad-

~visers.

One reason it is such a problem
to handle this group is that all the
presidents are; required to attend
the meetings and they are not ac-
customed to letting some one else
preside, others feel‘ that in orderto
have their house represented they
must do alot of talking. One fea-
ture, however, of the council is that
it is _a great asset to any one ex-
pecting to be a public speaker or a
politician. We really think he would
be -better suited. for the latter. One
of the pet sayings in the council is,
“if you will nominate me for a cer-
tain office I will see that your man
is nominated for the other.” Don’t
be alarmed because this group is no
more political than any other one.

Interfraternity Council has felt
from the very beginning of the year

that Student Council has not played .

.t.hem fair. They did away withthe
freshman regulations after the fra-
ternities'decided to have deferred
rushing to aid them in their enforce-
ment. They felt that Student Coun-
cil overstepped their rights in sev-'
eral. matters, this year in regard to
social functions, so to get around
this matter they decided to let the
presidents of each group attend the
other meetings. This worked out
ﬁne for neither of *the presidents at-
tended the other’s meeting, but it
solved the problem.

We can’t.condemn this group for
they have good Pittsburgh stogies
at their meetings «and they serve a
choice of three different brands of
cheap cigarets. They made over
$200 on their ball, but the catch
there was’ that the goodbrothers
had to set their girls up to an extra
feed -after, to make up for the cheap
favors they gave. They have -sent a
committee to investigate the e
conditions of the various houses on
the campus, as a result of no houses
have burned down, and the commit-
tee will make good ﬁremen -or get
some good ideas on how to keep
house. _ —

The athletic committee has also
managed to spend some of council’s
hard earned money. They, have pur-

$2_5, altho it is advertised as a

ARMRUSTER

Adolph:"—Patzlass Armbruster faces
the serious chargeﬂof stuﬁing ballot
boxes in therecent Faculty club
election. Dr. Lundborg who brings
the charge sayshe overheard Arm-
bruster while phoneing for a-date in
State Hall phone booth attempt to
bribe Sam the State Hall janitor. 2.

Lundborg states that Armbruster
offered Sam a new celluloid collar if
he would_ﬁll the ballot boxes with
old philosophy examination. books.
Sam replied thatithe only training

 

A be had in philosophy was how to

chew tobacco.

Omar C. Held when interviewed"
_ said thatfon the evening of Septem-

ber 14, 1927, Arinbruster was ob-
served in frequent conversation
with a dark bird with a_ long bill.
It later developed that the dark guy

. was a tailor trying to collect-a little

money. Armbruster was heard to
make, the cryptic remark. Yeah!
What am-I going to use for money

—potatoe chips? Held has deduced‘-

from this that the stolenmoney is
in the potato bins in the Faculty
club cellar. ' ‘
Jules La B.arthe~'s_aid. that there
were more things in the cellar" than
you coulddream of, then added
dreamily that hewas very fond of
dreams and a great - believer ‘in
them. Didyou ever taste a Volstead
dream he asked me. Firstlyou take
yourlemon juice thoroughly chilled
etc., etc. Mr. William Morrell who
is very fond of music has secured
the. large room immediatel.y above
the basedrum. It reminds me of my
old Kentucky home in‘ Virginia, he
says, with the peaceful darkies
quietly clubbing one another to
death. - > ,
Can you give me some,idea of
the routine of the day,.M.arie. Mc-
Swigan ‘asked him ‘of the" boys at
the Faculty club. In the morning
we allslide down the banisters to
breakfast, some rush-down the hill
to classes, some rush to chess,-

some don’t '_rush.at all but just sit. i

 

Caught on the third ‘floor of the
I Eta Pieihouse, 3409 Terrace street,
at an early hour this morning, Vic-
tor W. Packard, erstwhile Pitt track
athlete, utilized his pole vaulting
ability" and escaped through the
window as Dean Thirsty W. Som
entered the front door. --

With. the track season over, Pack_-
ard had. thrown caution to the four
winds and invaded, the I Eta Pie
house last night on an important
mission. While in the midst of ac-
tions, he heard the frontdoor bang,
and just as footsteps were heard on
the ﬁrst staircase, Packard managed
to tie his shoestring and vault from
the third -ﬂoor window.

PACKARD STIFFENS

In an interview with the writer
this morning Packard praised the
art of pole vaulting to the sky.
.“Never did I realize that such a
dumb avocation as jumping, over
one bar with another, be of such in-
trinsic value to me. What‘ if I had
never taken up- pole vaulting, and
had been a high. or broad. jumper
instead, what would I have’done?_”
v Upon hearing of the incident, of-
ficials of the A. A. U., headed by
Mr. Gloom, hastened-to the home at
3409 Terrace street, and measured
the distance from the ground ‘to the
third ﬂoor window sill. Allowing for
a’ thirty mile gale,‘ which undoubt-
edly aided Packard, they estimated

ing to their oﬁices in the Pittsburghv

ﬁgures ‘they had secured. -on,-Atho 
scene and following a..two hour'_cor!~.
ference announced that Packard had
set ‘a -new tri-state, intercollegiate;
and world’s record in the pole vault.

MAKES OWN POLE

Only one obstacle stood in the
way of -.ofﬁcially recognizin ‘ the‘
mark as a new Pitt record, an that
was the. fact that'_Packard’s vault- _
ing pole was not to be found by the
early morning expeditioners.~-Pack-*
ard claimed ‘that he had used the’
regulation bamboo vaulting ‘pole, in '
fact the same ‘one with which. he
copped the event at the-Penn iRe-
lays, in his epochmaking lea  

He said, “It is too bad; that II) was"
not a high jumper or '1 sure would
have set a mark in that event which.‘
would have stood for years ‘to;fcome..

Or even better, just‘ think. if Ihad.
been a‘ broad jumper." ' And- ‘here’?
somebody injected an, “0h,_- is" that-
so.” '

, It is rumored that the I Eta.~Pies
are contemplating mo_ving"to‘g the
eighth ‘ﬂoor of Webster‘ Hall: to aid
Packard in establishing a. still"bet-' .
ter mark in" his "specialty event,
realizing: that — elevators do not V run
after three A.‘ M. in this building.

As the Pitt" track’ mentor _ says,
“We surecan expect bigger and "bet-'-,

ture.”' ; ‘  » . -

     
     
      
    
      
      
 
 
 
     
   
 
  

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Warrants
were issued today for the -arrest of
ﬁve University of Pittsburgh stu-
dents who, Washington. police say,
are charged with inciting riot, bat-
tery and assault, and disturbing the
peace. . C

The_ students are‘ Willie Pettit,
chief pied-type of The Pitt.Weekly;
Wilson S. Anderson, retiring pencil-
wielder of the same paper; Royal
Hamlin, chief student counsel for
the Liberal Club; George Z. Fronk,
student-evangelist. and former Y. M.
C. A. president; and Van Henry iW.
Fris, ‘escaped bigamist from
Phoenix, Arizona.

The alleged disturbance is said to
have occurred during the recent
Hoover inauguration, at which time
the ’Pittsburgh students were. honor-
ing the new president and his cabi-
net, at a testimonial banquet. in the
Greasy Spoon, haven of Washing-
ton, elite. Three bystanders were se-
riously. injured in la hand-to-mouth
battle‘ that followed a ﬁery speech
by‘I-Iamlin on the principles of. free
liquor andfree -women. Witnesses
state that Pettit‘ and Anderson.
openly opposed the.wor'ds.of Ham-
lin and opened festivities with -a
barrage of watermelon seeds and
salted peanuts._ ‘

Fris ‘and Fronk, both noted. advo-
cates" of all kinds of freedom, sided
almost immediately with the
harrassed liberal, braving seeds‘ and
peanuts,.,until they reached 'tb.e~bar
upon‘ which. Hamlin was standing.
Atthis. point Hamlin, with orator-
i"cal' fervor, announced‘ that it was

long before Hoover. and the entir
cabinet‘. had taken sides. -
Additional forces arrived and
strengthened the liberal cause when
Al Smith and an army of ‘support-
ers took their stand at the bar." The
divided Hoover forces,‘ following

under the leadership of Pettit and
a heated battle raged until a
ricochet}-of oyster shells struck the
new president. '

The altercation is said to. be I.‘

groups at the Pittsburgh school.
Following news of the impendin
arrest, Pettit; and» his-. clique are. sai
to have charged the‘? Hamlin group
