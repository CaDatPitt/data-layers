Hot 

 

By MICHAEL Bucsxo

The battle for the dollar
among local record stores is giv-
ing new meaning to the term “hot
-wax.” V

The four record stores in the

' Oakland area-—Oas'is, The
Record Outlet, Garbage Records
and The Record Graveyard--
havrlong competed for the dis-
posable income of the college
market. National Record Mart
(N RM) went so far as to change
its store into an Oasis{a separate
corporation but largely tied to
NRM) in order to better compete
in the area.

Jerry Weber, owner of Gar-
bage Records, called Forbes
Avenue “Record Row” and a
look at the history of the retailers
reveals a real “family” atmos-
phere: the manager of The
Record Outlet was formerly
manager of Oasis; Weber used to
be a partner in The , Record
Graveyard; and the ex-manager
of The Record Graveyard was
manager of the now- defunct
Flo's Records. Like any family,
this one has its share of internal
fighting.

Garbage Records has come
under fire from National Record
Mart and national record com-
panies, who contend that the
used record store’s sale of pro-
motional albums (promos) is
illegal.

A stamp placed on each pro-
motional album states that any
sale or unauthorized transfer of
the record is unlawful. There is

“It's illegal,” said Bob Alt-

said he does not know how used
record stores are obtaining pro-
mos but contends that “we do
whatever we can to find out."

Brenner Leaves ThemNapping

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Did you ever think you could

walk out on David Brenner because 1

he was boring? That was apparently
the reason why much of the audience
at Brenner's lunchtime appearance
on Saturday left before the come-
dian was finished. I

Those who came to the lecture
expecting . the fast-firing, joke-
cracking Brenner, who inundates his
“Tonight Shdw"audiences with wit,
were sadly disappointed.

“I don’t think of this as an
audience," Brenner, said to the
nearly sold-out crowd who came to
see him. “I think of it as sitting
around talking."

Although David Lawrence Hall is
no Holiday House, where Brenner

"has been appearing, students

expected to be entertained. Instead,
the whole hour was devoted to ques-
tions by the audience, and straight-
forward answers from Brenner,
most of which were about comedy
itself.

“I probably know less about
comedy than anyone, but I can do
it,” said Brenner, who calls himself
“the last guy who has come along in
stand-up comedy."

“I’m not new," he said. “I'm just
still here and no one has come to
replace me." ‘

I

Although several factors, like the
state of the economy, have “reduced
the market for comedy, he said
there's still plenty of room for good
comedians.

»-He blasted television as a “mass
media that sells soap and detergent”
rather than provide art, and said
that cancelling Second City TV was
poor judgement on the part of TV
executives.

“SCTV is the most inventive
comedy on TV,” he said. “It's a
shame it was cancelled." (The next
question was: “What’s SCTVI")

“You’re -dealing with, block-
heads," Brenner said about televi-

sion executives. “They get promoted
to the point of inefficiency."

The owner of three television sets,
Brenner said he rarely watches any
of them. He had a pilot TV show
that flopped in 1976 and attributes
its failure to: the capacity in which a
black personwas placed, having a
gay person on the show, and that he
portrayed a divorced man sleeping
under the same roof with his ex-wife.

“Two years later you could sleep
with a goat and it didn't matter,” he
said. ‘

Although Brenner is listed in the
Guiness Book of World Records as
the most popular and most guest-

hosted comedian on TV, he said he’

doubts he will ever be host of the
Tonight Show.

The reasons for this, he said, are
that the show will die when Johnny
Carson leaves, and that executives
would never hire a minority as host
of a talk show. ‘

There is also prejudice against
women in comedy,, according to
Brenner.

Koob Lecture
Attracts Few ,

By TODD ERKEL

Do not expect to see any lectures
on the Pitt Program Council’s
summer schedule next year.“ A visit
last Thursday by Kathryn Koob,
one of the Americans held hostage at
the U.S. embassy in Iran, drew a
scant audience of less than 30 people
to David Lawrence Auditorium.

PPC scheduled the lecture, the
first ever held during the summer, as
an “experiment” to see how students
would support this type of event.
Organizers remained optimistic
early last week, estimating attend-
ance at I00-I50 but none of the $3
tickets were sold by Thursday. and it
was decided to allow anyone who
came that night in free of charge.

Koob agreed to appear at Pitt for-
less than she usually charges, but her
reduced fee of $ I000 still represented
one half of the PPC‘s summer
budget. / ‘

Daniel Brosky, PPC summer pro-
gramming chairman, hoped the lee-
ture would attract a large group of
foreign students but at least one for-
eign student organization knew
nothing about l(oob‘s visit.

“We didn't know about it," Bah-
man Seperhnia, advisor of the“Mus-
lim Student Organization said.
There are approximately I00
members of this organization on
campus during the spring and

. summer according to Seperhnia.

PPC adviser Gina Miller thinks
the poor attendance Thursday
shows that the events in Iran simply
do not concern students anymore.

“The Iranian issue is probably
dead,” Miller said. “The potential
was there, and we thought the
appeal would be there as well.”

Kathryn Koob lived for 444 days
as a hostage of angry, disillusioned
Iranians, fearful that every day
might be her last. During that time,
Americans took to the streets and
showed their patriotism and support
for the 53 hostages in the American

Embassy. But three years later, that '

patriotism and suport seems to have
waned.

Koob spoke at David Lawrence
Auditorium last Thursday in front
of a small audience about her book
“Guest of the Revolution," which
gives an insider's account of events
that occurred while she was a
hostage. ,

“I was scared. I would have been a
fool not to be,”she said. "If someone

ance by ﬁlmmaker Robert Altman
sold only 56 advanced tickets but
drew a total audience of 744.,

“We thought, ‘Should we cancel
this, or might this be a repeat of the
Altman appearance?‘,” Miller said.

“We already had our money out in,

our The Pitt News advertisements
and posters, so we threw that away.
We thought we better not due to the
money committed and the potential
of the walk-ins. However, there wer-

you have to deal with in many ways.
I believed God’s grace and strength

Koob explained that herjob in the
foreign service took her to Iran to
work with American binational cen-
ters (where Americans go to social-
ize) when the revolution broke out

.. and she was taken hostage.

Apart from the fear and anxiety,
Koob said she didn’t really hate her
captives. She said the attack was
directed against America because it
was the most active enemy.

Koob said that students didn't

said. “But the people who are A

wiser.”

National Record Mart and
record company spokesmen con-
tacted, all allege that illegal tran-
sactions are taking place between
those who are given promos, disc
jockeys, college radio stations,
newspapers and the used record
stores.

“They (used record stores)
either steal them or they get them
from reviewers,” Altshuler said.

Doug Gebhard, former man-
ager of The Record Graveyard,
and Garbage Records’ Weber
agree that most of their promos
come from local college radio
stations.

“If anybody wants to sell
records to us, we’re going to buy
them,” Gebhard said. '

That “anybody,” according to
one source in the used record
business, includes representa-
tives qf the record, companies
themselves—promotional and
salespeople who are given quan-
tities of promos to distribute to
radio stations and record retail-
ers. An employee at a local used
record store said that at least one

“It's up to our supervisors to

find out,” Fritzges said, refer-

ring to the sale of promos by
record company representatives.
“It’s sad...I hope it isn’t in our
backyard.”

Regardless of from where the
promos are coming, used record
retailers maintain that there is
nothing illegal on their part.
They agree that if prosecution
were likely,/the record compan-
ies would have initiated some
kind of action by now.

A system to combat the sale of
promoshas already been started
by some record companies. This
systemknumbers the albums
sequentially‘, allowing record
companies to trace the albums
back to the original distributor.

“The. ﬂaw comes in,” Fritzges
said, “when someone sees one of
my records at a "record store-

“Used record stores are good
for the college market," McGon-
igle said. “It brings in business.
When someone can‘t find what
he’s looking for there, he comes

The sale of promos at used
record stores will undoubtedly
take some time before being
resolved. Until then, the family
squabble will continue because.
as Garbage Records‘ Weber
points out, “The record compan-
ies have been trying to combat if
for some time, but they still have
to give albums to (radio) stations

culture. She added that the students
detested the U.S. government, espe-
cially President Jimmy Carter.

One ofthe things that Koob men-
tioned in her lecture was the fate of
the students who took the hostages.
During the 444 days, the students
were treated as national heroes, she
said. Some of the students went on
to jobs of status, but many were
thrown into the Iran/Iraq war and
killed and others have simply disap-
peared from the public eye.

When asked if they (the hostages)
knew how’ upset Americans were

over their capture, she replied, “it

was beyond our expectations that.
th‘e»\{\merican people would take
such an overwhelming personal
interest in us."

She commented on being held’

hostage by saying that she followed
the Lord’s teaching of loving one’s
enemy. She said some days she got
very angry and felt cheated, but the
most important thing she did was
make it through.

Koob went on to say that the thing
she got most was the miracle of God
and since then, she hasn’t had to
carry the extra baggage of hate.

Egyptian Poet Observes Cu/gtur

.k_.

. By PEGGY FERRI

Many poets and writers have
visited the United States, have
absorbed its culture and beer»
impressed by its nature. Farouk
Mohamed Gueida, Egyptian poet
and journalist, came to the United
States to gather impressions about
our technology and its impact on the
arts. ‘

Gueida visited Pitt on Monday as
part of a tour of American cities
through the International Visitor
Program. The tour was sponsored
by the United States Information
Agency. -

He began writing poetry when he
was 10 years old, and in the years
since, he has travelled‘ extensively,
always searching for ways in which
technology has affected new direc-
tions in literature, which he believes
are very important.

“There is more to life in the Mid-
dle East than the political side,"
Gueida explained. “There are devel-
opments in the culture, in the novels
and in the short story."

Cultural relations are as impor-
tant as._ political relations bet-ween
countries, and he said the best way
to really know a people is to under-
stand their culture.

The purpose of his visit to the uni-

- versity was to have a tour of The Pitt

News office. Visitors have come to
Pitt before through theservice but
not to see the newspaper offices.

In Egypt, Gueida explained, col- I

lege newspapers do not have video
display terminals or other sophisti-
cated equipment. After the tour of
such orderly and modern facilities,
however, Pitt’s other machines
probably gave Gueida a different
impression. '

The elevators in Schenley Hall
were not functioning properly (the
doors would not" shut until the
fourth or fifth try) and the copy
machines at Hillman Library would
not cut the paper to letter size.
Gueida was good-natured about the
delays and laughed when he referred
to “new technology.”

“I am interested in the technol-
ogy,” he said. “Technology has
affected the culture. Even the music

Parking
Cost  

increases

The Oakland parking
dilemma continues.

John Vrana, the assistant vice
chancellor for business and
finance accounced recently that
faculty and staff_parking permits
will be increased by $1 beginning
Sept. l. Indoor parking will be
increased to $4l per month and
outdoor parking will be
increased to $36 per month.

Vrana said the university has
to use the expensive indoor park-
ing because lots near Pitt are not
subsidized by university funds.
He said that is because many
faculty members andstudents do
not use the parking and it would
be unfair to charge them for
something they do not use.

Although Vrana said Pitt’s
parking is not expensive, when
compared to two other schools in
Pittsburgh, it is.

A typical faculty or staff
member who utilized Pitt’s park-
ing can expect to pay $492 annu-
ally for indoor parking and $432
for outdoor parking.

The parking office at
Duquesne University has out-
door parking that is owned by
the school, and permits run $l I0
annually. A parking office
employee at Carnegie-Mellon
University said permits at that
school run between $92 and $290
per year depending upon the
location of the lot. '

Vrana said the construction of
new parking lots near the Pitt
campus would be costly and spa-
ces for the lots would be difficult
to find.

is computerized. There are even
computers that can write poetry as
art (computer graphics), but they
will never have one that can produce
feeling. That comes from man.

“Technology can be used as a cul-
tural medium and to help inform
other countries of directions and
developments in the arts," Gueida
said. “The problem is no culture is
doing this. As a poet and a journal-
ist, I am interested in what way tech-
nology is going.”

For example, he said, the “war
between the book and the TV” is
now an international problem.-

“People,” he explained, “are los-
ing the desire to read and book pub-
lish-ing is becoming more
expensive.” Using technological
developments, he added, might
remedy this problem. “The air
medium (what Gueida terms televi-
sion and radio) is a new phase of
civilization which began in
America.”

The editor of the cultural section
of the daily newspaper Al-Ahram
said he cannot" understand why
American newspapers do_ not print
poetry and short stories as do Arab
papers. Y »

“When I visited The Washington
Post, they told me they refused to
publish poetry and short stories-
this I can’t understand. The media

"must keep a balance of life, and for
this, we need two sides. You can
have the computers, but you need to
have the poetry and music.

American novels and cinema are
popular in the Arab world, he said.
“In my country,” he explained,
“people know much about Ameri-
can television and literature, but
more efforts have to be made to
translate these productions.”

Gueida has published 12- books,
including -eight poetry selections,

two drama books, an economic.

book and one travel guide. His
books have sold over 30,000 copies,
and he is one of ‘Egypt‘s foremost
poets.

On this visit, an American pub-
lisher has offered to publish a trans-
lated collection of his works
tentatively titled “My Home In Your
Eyes," according to Gueida.

Business

Established

The John W. Burkhart Schol-
larship, awarded annually by the
Business Journals Publication
Corp., publisher of The Pitts-
burgh Business Times, has been
established in Pittsburgh.’

The $1,000 scholarship will be
awarded annually to a student or
students showing promise in the
field of businessjournalism. This
year, two Pitt students shared the
prize, each receiving an award of
$500. The two winners werejun-
ior media communications

English writing major Anne
Kline. — ‘

——i———————.I1

“Your production (of books) is
too much, and you need to show us
the best of them and translate them
into Arabic," Gueida said. “We need
more information about your cul-
ture." He added that though rela-
tions between the U.S. and. Egypt
have been strained in the past

because of various political situa-“'

tions, relations now are getting bet-
ter.

“There have been many students
visiting between the countries, and

many books have been translated,”

he said. “Your poets and writers
have even visited in-the Arab world.”

For many people, Kahlil Gibran,
author of “The Prophet,” is the best
known Arab poet, a fact that inter-
ests Gueida. .

“You have him all over,” he
laughed. “Mavbe you think he is
American?” He explained that
Gibran, who was born in Eebanon,
visited America and spent many
years here.

Just as technology has had an
impact on our culture, it has affected
the direction of arts in other coun-
tries in similar ways, according to
Gueida. 7

“Poetry in the Arab world is now
more near the life of the people-
closer to their problems and hopes
and dreams," he explained. “The
complications of life and love, not
only between a man and a woman
but between all peoples, are subjects.
Poetry is being written about the
problems of people. There have been
many social troubles in the Middle
East, and the poetry expresses these
feelings."

Gueida said he is not afraid of the
future ofthe arts because of progress
in technology.

“Perhaps, the poets will all disap-
pear because there will be no place
left for us. But no,” he said seriously,
“there will be changes, but nothing
to replace feeling. Arts and poetry
are the biggest values in this life.”

Making

  The Grade

To football players, it’s ajfact of life that profes-
sional recruiting is done on college campuses, where’
athletes can benefit from professional coaching and
organization in amateur competition. That means
going to college is a fact of life for the serious football
player, who must be measured for academic as well as
athletic ability.

‘ Facing these extra demands is a mixed blessing for
the student jock. For the real stars—the Tony Dorsetts
and Herschel Walkers of the world—the struggle to
maintain academic standards in high school and col-
lege can be, among other things, a distraction from
more profitable pursuits. For the rest—those who
don’t want or aren’t sure to get a pro contract—the
academic credentials they accumulate take on much
greater. signiﬁcance. The education they have been

.“forced” to get becomes their protection from the tight
market for paid athletes.

When high schools and colleges try to mold pro-
grams to the needs of student athletes, the different
needs of the “stars" and the “rest” become grounds for
dispute. .

For example, the National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation (NCAA) has drawn public attention by setting
new minimum college aptitude test scores for athletes
on NCAA teams. Albert Fondy, president of the Pitts-
burgh Federation of Teachers has spoken out against
requiring high school athletes to earn five C grades
each term.

Unfortunately, both of these disputes center around
minimum standards for the academic performance of
the student athlete and disregard the need for min-

- imum standards of quality in the classrooms through

which student athletes must pass. The players are hurt
most by this disregard, for whether or not they are"
“pro material" or can earn a C average, they could all
benefit from better quality high school and college
programs.

Genuine concerns for an athlete’s education must
begin at the high school level (if not earlier) where
students wishing to progress in organized sports like
football should be directed into academic programs
whose goal is’to prepare the student for college. These
programs, obviously, would be very different from
classes designed to allow students to earn C’s.,

This concern must also carry over into college pro-
grams, which should provide academic advising and
assistance directed toward the particular challenges
that student athletes face.

Obviously, schools must have some way to check an
athlete’s academic progress at many points in his
school career, and for this reason, grades are impor-
tant. But grades are not the only consideration, as the
positions of the NCAA and Albert Fondy imply.

By calling only for certain grades or scores from the
student, needed attention is distracted from the impor-
tance of. having quality programs available for ath-
letes. The school and the student must each perform
because both share in the responsibility for the stu-
dent’s future.

Oakland could never be called a
college town; it lacks the quaintness
and serenity of a University Park, a
California, Pa., or an Edinboro. On
top of that, Pitt is located in a major
U.S. city, so that virtually eliminates
it from college town status.

But in its own strange way, Oak-
land is a college town. In the months
between September and April,
30,000 students are wandering
around Oakland's stores, restau-
rants, bars and streets. Most of the
over-21 (and some under) crowd can
anticipate nudging fellow students
at Peter's, C.J.‘s or Danny's on any
given night.

Shopkeepers must also deal with
students in their stores eight months
a year. While many of these places
would be out of business if it-were
not for the students, I am sure the
student population of Oakland bugs
shop owners at times.

In addition, there are people that
live in Oakland that are not stu-
dents, yet they have to live among
them. South Oakland is the prover-
bial American melting pot and
North Oakland is the home of many
non-students and retirees who
happen to like the Oakland section
of the city. These are the people that
have to put up with the yelling at 3
a.m., the dilapidated apartment
buildings that are maintained by
owners who only want to makeea
quick buck from college students,
and many times, loud music playing
24 hours a day.

But it’s summer in Oakland now.
The trees are blooming, the weather
is nice and most of the students are
gone from the streets. This is when
Oakland is at its finest.

From a student’s viewpoint that
means no more crowded bars until
September, smaller classes, free
movies in Schenley Park, ice cream

For the year-round residents of
Oakland, summer must mean so
much more. It means peace and
quiet, being able to watch neighbor-
hood children play in the streets at

dusk without groups of drunk col- '

lege studentsstaggering by; it means
a return to a way of life that is tran-
quil and old-fashioned; a chance for
the residents of Oakland to get to
know their neighborhood better.

This will be my first summer in
Oakland; I usually go away to some
Southern paradise during the warm
months, but I decided to stay here
this year. I think I will enjoy the
ethnicity, the peace and quiet, and
the beauty that one can find in Oak-
land; because if you look past the
roudy students, Oakland truly is
beautiful.

Q: Does an adopted child have
the right to discover the identity
of his natural parents?

A: Only in five states: Alabama,
Connecticut, Kansas, South
Dakota and Virginia. In these
states, an adopted child has the
right to inspect his original birth

of the law. In Pennsylvania this is
currently l8 years.

Q: When a child reaches the age
of majority, is he given all the
rights of an adult?

A: Not necessarily. In many
states, upon reaching the age of
majority, one is considered an
adult for most purposes, but still
a child for others.

For example, in Pennsylvania,
the age of majority is 18, and
upon a child‘s l8th birthday he is

Suicidezl ‘The Bottom of . A Well”

_ In most countries throughout the
'world, the suicide rate in adoles-
cents through young adults has
doubled over the past 10 years, and

‘it now ranks as the second largest

cause of death during teenage to
adult years. Studies of suicidal
behavior on the college campus
have led to the conclusion that sui-
cide is a serious public health prob-
lem, and that the situation is getting

- ‘WOYSB.

Grace Kirshman of United Men-

I -1 tal Health in Pittsburgh\said,“There

has been a big percentage jump in
the number of suicides. We’re not
talking about a large number of peo-

, ple, but the rise of young adults up

to the age of twenty-eight (who
killed themselves) has alarmed pro-
fessionals and parents.”

She said that a feeling of helpless-
ness or hopelessness brings about
the suicidal intentions and A can

lcause one to take his own life. .

“For example, a kid may kill him-
self after his dog died,” she said. “lt
may look ridiculous to someone on
the outside, but nevertheless he
went through stages of grief and
stress great enough for him to com-

A mit suicide.”

The total number of suicides in
the United States is about 35,000
annually, and people from age 12 to
24 comprise about 5,000 of that.

The feelings of hopelessness that '

lead to suicide among young people
are enhanced by the insecurity and
mobility of today’s society, accord-
ing to Reverend Orrin Camp of
Contact Pittsburgh, a 24-hour crisis
intervention service.

“A lot of social trends are taking

place,” Camp said. “Todayis a .,

much more mobile society. There
was a sense. of security young peo-
ple had back in the fifties and
sixties.”

According to Camp, things like
the King and Kennedy assassina-
tions and the Vietnam War shat-

" tered the illusions that li_fe_was safe

and secure.

“A person is ‘trying to achieve a
sense of identity when he says,

 

The Pitt News, Wednesday“ May 25, 1983

‘Who am I? Where am I going?’ You
addpadolesence, which can be any-
thing but a pleasant experience,” he
said.

Families breaking down have
- added to this sense of insecurity
among young people, as has the
breakdown of the church and reli-
gion as something to rely upon.’
There has also been a serious chal-
lenge of national authority, Camp
said, which contributes to insecurity
in today’s young people.

“We find out we’re not as
together as a nation as we once
thought,” he said. ‘‘I think this has a
tremendous impact on young peo-
ple who have this dream of the world
and what they’re going to do with
themselves. ‘

“Suicide for young people is one
result of a psychological process of
growth and development and

rapidly changing trends and mores.”

 
‘Suicidal youth all
have one thing in
common: a nagging
lack of optimism,
lack of hope about
their future and an
enormous sense of

unhappiness.’
 

Last year, 2,000 to 2,500 people
between the ages of 19 and 24 killed
themselves. The only other thing
responsible for more deaths in
young people is accidents, and

Camp suspects that some of these ’

accidents might also be suicides,
because coroners are often hesi-
tant to call a death suicide unless
they are certain.

Camp said that some people
engage in behavior that leads to sui-
cide, such as alcohol and drug
abuse, without openly killing
themselves.

“Suicide does not have to be con-
scious,” he said. “The unconscious
drives that a person might be sui-
cidal are expressed through their
behavior."

Mental Health and Mental Retarda-

tion Center said that when people
commit suicide, it is because they
see no other solution to their
problems.

One- potential suicide victim
explained to Moritz, “lt’s like being
at the bottom of a well with no way
to get out.”

Suicidal patterns show that more
men than women commit suicide
and generally use more violent
means. Among teens and young
adults, it has been found that nar-

cotics play a role shortly before the_

death.

In a study done by Michael Peck,
PhD. of the Los Angles- Suicide
Prevention Center and Robert E.
Litman, M.D., it was found that
nearly half of suicidal teenagers
were involved in some form of drug
or alcohol abuse shortly before their
death.

_ This does not mean that the spe-
cific substance abused led to death,

.but the same factors that led the

person to drug abuse contributed to
their suicide.

Numerous factors can explain
why a person turns to death; family
problems and pressures, the loss of
a loved one, financial pressures, and
high academic competition can
result in feelings of anonymity and
isolation.

' In the Peck and Litman study, 90
percent of the suicidal people inter-
viewed were reported to have been
on poor terms with their families.
This seems to have been a common
denominator among suicidal
youngsters.

A large number of this group was

reported to have been in physical
fights with other persons and an
equally large number reported to
have engaged in physical fights with
persons in their own families.

It was also reported that there
was a considerable amount of physi-
cal and assaultive behavior among
family members. ‘

Nearly two-thirds of this group
had had some form of psychother-
apy or counseling, and one-third
had at one time been hospitalized
for mental or emotional problems.

“lt should be pointed out,” write
Peck and, Litman “that suicidal
youth, regardless of the specific
trigger factor, all have one thing in
common: a nagging lack of optim-
ism, lack of hope about their future
and an enormous sense of
unhappiness.”

In a book entitled Too Young To
Die, author Francine Klagsbrun
wrote, “A large number of suicides
and suicidal attempts among young
people and older ones can be linked
in some ways to a state of severe
depression.”

Among college students, compe-
tition often leads a student to take
his or her life. Suicide is the second
biggest cause of death for college
students, and the rate of suicide
among them is higher than it is for

men and women the same age who .

are not in college.

“Suicidal college students often
fail in their attempts to discuss frus-
trations or failures with their par-
ents,” Klagsbrun wrote. “Many suic-
idal students worry about doing well

in school.”

This is particularly true at high-
prestige schools, where researchers
have found a pattern among victims.

With

\

for Studies of Suicide Prevention,
National Institute of Mental Health,
it was reported that young men who
commit suicide are likely to have
lost a father, either through death or

0 divorce, ‘before the age of sixteen.

*3

.‘‘If the father is alive," Frederick
wrote, “he is likely to be very suc-
cessful and heavily involved in his
work, without having had time to
develop a solid relationship with his
son. Frequently the suicidal sons of
successful men have spent some
time in a boarding school.”

Girls who commit suicide are
likely to come from homes where
the mother is a domineering and
narcissistic figure and the father is
weak and ineffectual.

According to Klagsbrun, there
are two particular groups of people
in which suicide is dominant. These
are young black men in their early
twenties and adolescent girls, black
or white.

In the late seventies in New York
City, it was discovered that twice as
many black men as white men killed
themselves, and this was reported
to have been similar in other large,
urban areas.

Dave Brent, of Western Psychia-
try at the University of Pittsburgh,
said he doesn't know how accurate
this statement is, but he feels people
who have suicidal tendencies, white

_ or black, may have their tendencies
enhanced by published reports of
suicides.

Answering

Most experts agree that when
someone thinks about killing
himself, he thinks of suicide as a
temporary, “I'll show you” mea-
sure to solve a problem—not as
the permanent, ﬁnal step that it
is. Luckily, there are facilities
designed to make that person
aware of the irrevocability of
suicide.

Organized efforts to prevent
suicide began in 1904, and there
now exist a number of facilities in
Pittsburgh both to help someone
through an immediate crisis and
to provide long-term counseling.

Whether it is in counseling

\‘I‘.\‘Z\\V~ AKA

 r help is“
hesitant to make.

“I'm currently doing research to
see whether or not there is a model-
ing effect; that is, if people are
exposed to suicide and reports of it
then they themselves might be more
likely to commit suicide,” Brent
said.

He said he got the idea from kids

_ who told him they thought of suicide

after watching certain shows on
television.

“That may or may not be true,”
said Brent. “I’ve also heard‘ of
schools where a number of suicides
have occurred within a short period
of time relative to one another.”

‘Many young people
who commit suicide
have never had one
other person they can

trust and admire.’
 

A person's suicide plan is a signifi-
cant aspect of his risk, and in order
to determine the potential serious-
ness, the one who is to aid the
potential victim should be able to
determine the risk of the plan.

There are different levels of gaug-
ing the riskiness of the situation;
there is the highly lethal‘ methods,

_ such as someone talking a_bo_utkil;_

The

sessions to try to get to the heart
of troublesome matters or in 24-
hour help to get someone
through a crisis, the rule of
thumb among counselors and
psychologists is to take every
suicidal gesture as a serious one.

“Even if a student comes and
he failed a test, and the student is
depressed and crying and wants
to kill himself, that may sound
trivial, but you can't take it as
that,” said Dr. Kevin Bowman of
Pitt's Counseling Center.

“It may be part of a larger
problem and is the straw that
broke the camel's back,” he said.
“You take everything the stu-
dent says seriously until some
evidence suggests otherwise.”

Bowman, one of several psy-

 

\

ling themselves by gunshot or hang-
ing, which is more serious than
someone who threatens a drug
overdose.

Frederick wrote, “Psychologists
have found that student suicides
more often involve the absence of a
‘significant other’ person than fail-
ure in schoolwork. ‘

“Many young people who commit
suicide have never had one other
person they can trust and admire.”

People can help those in need by
encouraging th potential suicide vic-
tim to talk about their problems and
dilemmas. '

Studies of committed suicides
reveal an individual history of prior
repeated suicide attempts or
threats. Of special concern are
those persons who have expe-
rienced suicidal episodes during
which they nearly died.

Anxiety, depression and confu-
sion form components of suicide
risk. In a booklet by the American

. Association of Suicidology, depres-

sion is reported to be a major factor.
The presence of a good friend, car-
ing and loving family members, or
involvement with helping profes-
sionals, all can lower suicide risk.

Cry

chologists at Pitt, said that 25 to
30 percent of the students he
sees are suffering from depres-
sion. Of that, 10 to 15 percent
have serious suicidal thoughts.

“You have to weed out what's
a serious suicidal [consideration]
and what's a student who has
had a bad day," he said. “A lot of
times it is a cry for help that they
are terribly unhappy and they
want their lives to be different.”

When counseling a student
who is suffering from depres-
sion, Bowman said that hejust
tries to assess the situation and
the reality of a suicide attempt.
He might consider hospitaliza-
tion for the student who wants to
immediately take his life and is
not in control.

If the situation is less immed-
iate, Bowman said he might talk
to the student’s family members,
set up more counseling appoint-
ments and give; the student a
phone number or a way of reach-
ing someone after hours if things
get tough.

One facility designed espe-
cially to provide 24-hour help for
young people with problems is
the TEEN Hotline, in which pro-
fessionals counsel people con-
templating suicide.

“Running away and suicide
have become almost synony-
mous as a means of handling
something,” said Donna Rae
Decello, executive director of
the TEEN Hotline. “We have to
deal with that.

“We can't presume they're
not going to do it, and we can't
say, ‘You can't do it.’ "

The people at TEEN Hotline
try to get callers to feel that they
owe it to themselves to work
things out. In the case of people
who have been victimized,
Hotline couselors emphasize
that by considering suicide,

“People don't tend to call a
hotline to say goodbye,” Decello
said. “On some level they want
help. We try to take them very
seriously and work through what
good they feel they're going to
gain from the suicide.”

’People don't tend to
call a hotline to say
goodbye. On some
level they want some
help.’

Trying to obtain information
about what prompted the situa-
tion and why the caller wants to
kill himself is" one of the first
things a volunteer counselor for
glontact Pittsburgh is trained to

0.

Contact is ’a 24-hour crisis
intervention service that
receives about 20,000 calls annu-
ally. According to Contact
Director Reverend Orrin Camp,I
about 1 to 2 percent of these
calls are actually crisis-oriented.

Volunteers at Contact are
trained to establish a relation-
ship in which the caller feels he
can trust and rely upon the
volunteer.

“That reduces the sense of
isolation with someone that is
very prevalent in those who want
to kill themselves,” Camp said.

The volunteer is trained to
then assess the lethality of the
situation.

“I try to get informtion on how
they're going to do this,” Camp
said. “Three of the key elements
that we're [now] looking for are

Help '

-the more specific the plan, the

more lethal the means and the
availability of the means. Those
threethings raise the lethality of
the situation‘ from our perspec-

‘ tive because they say the person

has thought this thing tliézugh
clearly.

“Young people overreact, but
it's real," he said. ‘‘Is it really
debatable when someone,says,
‘My relationship with my girl-
friend has gone down the tubes,
and I'll never find another like
her again and, therefore, I'll do
away with myself’?

“The helper must see the
problem through the eyes of the
caller. It doesn't matter what the
counselor thinks but what the
caller thinks. It is better to take
something as serious than to say
this person doesn't mean it.
Doing so may be lethal for the
person who does mean it."

Another role of the volunteer
counselor is to provide hope in
what seems to be_ a hopeless
situation. In a crisis, Camp said,
things begin to narrow and sui-
cide often looks like the only
escape.

“They have run out of ways to
cope with this problem, and they
think that checking out of life is
the only way,” he said.

The important thing to realize
about a crisis is that it's only tem-
porary, and the purpose of a 24-
hour hotline is to get people over
the crises. Hotlines like Contact,
however, often follow up on the
situation and try to do something
about it.

“You don't want to conclude
the call with another sense of iso-
lation," Camp said.

“Ambivalence is a very impor-
tant factor in crisis intervention,"
he said. “This person has said ‘I
want to die,’ but he has called.
We try to emphasize the part of

g the individual that wants to live."

The Panther track team made its
final team trip this past weekend as it
competed in the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of
America (IC4A) championships at

illanova University under less than
ideal conditions.

“lt poured down rain almost the
entire meet,” Panther coach John
Vasvary said. “There were still some
excellent performances turned des-
pite the weather.”

Unlike the indoor championships,
in which only one of Pitt’s competi-

tors advanced to the ﬁnals, three‘

Panther entrants (five individuals in
all), qualified and scored in the l2l-
member conference championship.
Sophomore hurdler Roger King-
dom placed second behind Villan-
ova senior Rodney Wilson in the

. l l0-meter high hurdles. Kingdom's

time was 13.97.
Junior Todd Colas was the only

gther individual Panther to advance

to the finals. Colas ﬁnished sixth

with a time of l:48.8, outstanding.

under the weather conditions. In

fact, had the weather been better,’

Colas could very well have qualiﬁed
for the NCAA meet.

The other Panther entrant to
score was the 400-meter relay team

of Brian Mitchell, Kingdom, Rick_

Some big-time auctions were held
in the Western Pennsylvania area
during the winter months and fea-
tured some bidding that some
nationally-knour. schools hope will
pay big dividends not only during
this fall, but during subsequent Sep-
tembers. too. ‘

One of those schools is Pitt. And
the auctions it participated in were
for some of this country’s most tal-
ented women volleyball players.

It wasn't easy, Lady Panther
coach Shelton Collier admits, going
up against the likes of Penn State,
North Carolina State and Tennes-
see. amongst many others.

In the end, though. Collier not
only corralled two highly-touted

_“€N’ecruits but is looking forward to the

services of a walk-on junior and
another junior who sat out last year

at Ohio U.

For the second straight year. Nor-
win will have a representative on

Asberry and Rich Baderinwa placed
fifth with a time of4l .55 after having
run a 41.14 in the trial heat.

Their total of 11 points put the "

Panthers in 19th place——not bad,
considering that last year they had
only scored one point and didn’t fin-
ish in the top 50. \

Founded in l876, the IC4A is the
oldest collegiate athletic conference
in the country. This year marked its
l07th annual outdoor champion
‘ship.

George Mason of Virginia cap-
tured the team title with a total of 54
points. Maryland was second, riding

’ on the strength of its field events-—
the team didn't score a point on the
track. Villanova, the Big East
power, was third. i '

Among the ther local teams com-
peting, Penn State placed ‘seventh
and West Virginia 35th.

-TRACK NOTES: This weekend,
several of the Panthertrack team
members will travel to College Park,
Md., for the Georgetown Invita-
tional. Georgetown runs the meet,
but it’s held "at the University of
Maryland‘s Byrd Stadium.

The following weekend, the
NCAA champoinships will be held.
At the present time, only Kingdom,
the ll0-meter high hurdler, has
qualified. The Georgetown meet is
the final opportunity for the rest of
the Panther squad to qualify.

Pitt’s roster. Outside hitter Kris
Wexell, following in the footsteps of
sophomore Sally Gillespie, is
expected to be an instant starter,
replacing graduated Diane Zack.

Things will not be easy for Rich-
land middle blocker S_ue Hoover.
Her specialty position is more than

‘adequately filled on Collier’s fore-
court with the veteran experience of
Carmen Tapia and Ulana Kohutiak.
Both Tapia and Kohutiak will be
returning to assured starting spots
this September.

Wexell and Hoover are coming
off ofstate champion teams. Norwin
won its eighth straight AAA title last
month, and. Richland bagged the
AA crown.

With late August start-up drills
still about three months away. Colli-
er‘s roster seems to be in good shape
presently, perhaps even more so
than last season. Fielding only nine
players then, Collier will now have
the services of II members. all but
four with post-season experience.

Johnny Ray [foreground] and Dale Berra are key players in the Pirates’ attempt
to claim the Egstern Division title,

Losing three seniors after last sea-

son, Collier had to put up with the '

virtual invasion by other big-name
schools who came in search of what
the area high schools had to offer.

That was what Collier was prim-
arily up against. As a matter ofc-.nm-
parison, blue-chip players with
talent will travel—to NCSU, Jill
Berkebile; to Tennessee, Farrell’s
Lisa Stewart; to Penn State, Bald-
win’s Vida Kernich and Norwin's
Ellen Hemsler, regarded by some as
the state's top playmaker.

“A lot of it came down to scholar-
ship money,“ Collier emphasized.
“Right now. it’s a bidding war
because of the popularity of
women's sports. Volleyball, in par-
ticular, is booming in some areas."

But where Collier lost out on
recruiting phenoms, he countered by
picking up twojuniors. One, Cathy
Rupp. will be starting at the setter

‘spot but simultaneously will be fil-

ling two very big shoes vacated by
recently graduated Julie Gaul.

Starting Pitchers 

Aside, Pirates Can’t 

Shake Slow Start 

By SCOTT DEl.l.ETT

There are several things in life of
which a person can be certain. Death
and taxes are two. A third could
possibly be the Pittsburgh Pirates’
geting off to a__s_lo_w_,st_a_rt. ____ ,
Viewpoint

As of Monday's loss to Atlanta,
the Pirates had lost six of their last
I l games, and..their record stood at
l4-20. in fact, the Bucs are quickly
entering the cellar, a position nor-
mally reserved for the New York
Mets and the Chicago Cubs.

The ironic part is the Pirates won
their first five games of the 1983 sea-
son. Granted, four of the first five

games were against Houston, a team
which had a horrible start. Never-

     

Battles In Bidding Wars

A starting setter for three years,
Gaul was named the Big East MVP
last season and was known to be the
center of Pitt‘s dominating style for
the last couple of seasons.

Rupp transferred from Ohio a
year ago but had to sit out last sea-
son. The l983 campaign will be one
during which she hasto prove her-
self and prove to the skeptics that
Pitt can more than amply defend its
Big East championship crown.

That junior D.J. Warren will be
trying to catch a middle blocker
position next season is all a matter of
coincidence.

Said Collier, “I discovered her
[while] walking down the hall at
Trees [Hall] one day. Right now
we're going to teach her to be middle
blocker.“ A

Meantime, Collier has had his
sights set on Wexell for the better
part of three years. He had seen
immediate potential.

“Sue Wexell l‘ve known ever since

rnnlmurtl rm page ('I('w'n

theless, enthusiasm was running
rapid, as over 47,000 fans jammed
Three Rivers Stadium on opening
day.

Ever since then, Pittsburgh‘s for-
tunes have gone down. Are the prob-
lems of this year similar to years
past?

Take last year’s slump for exam-
ple. At one point, none of the start-
ing pitching staff had an earned run
average under 3.50. It took the
Pirates until May before a starting
pitcher had a complete game. The

hits were there, but not at the right -.

times. And shortstop Dale Berra
was having his trouble, both at the
plate and in the field. '

This season, the pitching staff has
been fairly solid. The bullpen of
Kent Tekulve and Rod Scurry have
been close to -unhittable. After get-
ting blasted early, Manny Sar-
miento has brought down his ERA
to 3.10.

The starters are miles ahead of the
I982 staff. Larry McWilliams has
been effective since coming from the
Braves last summer.‘Rick Rhoden,

despite Monday's outing and his 2-4 »

record. has an ERA of under 3.0.
Although John Candelaria has not
pitched effectively as of late, past
history has proven him to be a solid
pitcher when healthy.

The main problem with the staff is
finding the fourth and ﬁfth starters,
something the Pirates are going to
have to do soon as they are going on
a stretch of 46 games in 46 days. So
far, experiments by manager Chuck
Tanner have failed miserably.

Jim Bibby, coming off of a torn
rotator cuff injury—an injury from
which few pitchers could ever
recover—has experienced control
problems. His ETA hangs in double
digits. Randy Niemann is one outing
away from being a former Pirate.

Someone, either Bibby, Sar-
miento or Lee Tunnell must estab-
lish himself into the starting rotation

continued from page nine
in order for the-Pirates to be a chal-
lenge in the Eastern Division.
Things remain the same as last
year in the hitting department. Even

‘ though the Pirates had 12 hits Mon-

day night, two runs came from solo
home runs. Basically, the Bucs
scored their other run on ten hits.
Not a very good ratio.

First baseman Jason Thompson is
leading the Pirates in runs batted in
with I7. The National League leader
is Atlanta's Dale Murphy with 36.
Only four other Pirates have ten or
more RBI’s, an‘d‘the season is 35
games old. A.

Three start'ers—-Dave Parker,
Tony Pena and Dale Berra—are hit-
ting below .230. Pena should be able
to return to his typical numbers with
a little rest, and Parker seems to be
recovering from a pulled
hamstring-—he went three-for-four
Monday night.

The question mark remains with
Berra. He had a miserable start in
1982, and his .214 average is only
slightly better than last years. Is
Berra playing as well as he was dur-

ing the last two months of the 1982
campaign or does he actually play as
poorly as he is playing now? That
question could be answered as there
is no one on the Pirate bench who
can take over at shortstop.

The bench seems stronger at this
point compared to last year, as the
Pirates have outfielders Mike Easler
and Brian Harper, infielders Jim
Morrison and Richie Hebner as well
as catchers Gene Tenace and Steve
Nicosia. Although the batting aver-
ages are below par, some of it may be
blamed on the weather the Pitts-
burgh area has had during the
spring, especially on weekends.

Despite having a similar record to
this point last year, the Pirates are in
better shape. Pittsburgh is only 4 ‘/2
games out of first place while in 1982
the Bucs were II games out. The
Pirates are not the only ones
losing-—no one in the Eastern Div-
ision is pullingaway.

For now, it is only a matter oftime

to see if the Pirates are going to be in ,

the thick of the Eastern Division
race or be among the Cubs and Mets
as second division squads.

"she was a sophomore,” Collier said.
“And I think that she probably
could have been a starter on Pitt’s
varsity team when she was a junior
in high school.

“She was pretty much signed,
sealed and delivered for several
years.”

Now that Collier has his 1983 ros-

‘er 50l1d1.V Wrapped up, he will slow-

ly plan for several titanic matchups

. this fall. Included on the schedule

‘ are visits by Penn State, Florida

State and Lou-isi-‘ille to the Pitt Invi-
tational Sept. l5-l7. -

The Lady Panthers will travel to
Indiana for the annual Purdue Invi-
tational and will face, in addition to

‘the Lady Boilermakers, Nebraska
and Kentucky. Following that is a
visit to Tennessee to play the Lady
Vols and squads from Texas and
North Carolina. ~

Collier is also revamping his
offense as he scraps the 5-] (using
five hitters and one setter) in favor of
the 6-2. This scheme was recently
instituged by Panther coach/Ray

,__‘_Reilly, proving relatively successful.
— The 6-2 employs two setters who
both double as hitters.

numb all over at the thought of getting
slammed to the turf by some opposing

just by thinking about striking out when
there are two outs in the bottom of the

and Ohio State, Collier estimates
that his squad can qualify for the

we’ve beaten in the last three years,”
