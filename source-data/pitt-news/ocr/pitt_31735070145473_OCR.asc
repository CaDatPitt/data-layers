A canceled conference was resched-

for a Democratic Society hangs in

V limbo after an eventful week. _
Although Pitt’s chapter of Stu-

dents for a Democratic Society re-

moved its sponsorship of the Pitts-
burgh Freedom School, national
and Pitt members still met at the
Thomas Merton Center for the con-
ference over the weekend.

doesn’t have the best stats and his
name is rarely seen in the news,
but the intangible contributions
the defensive tackle makes might
just get him into the NFL.

Greg Gattuso, Pitt’s defensive
line coach, said he was impressed
by Mustakas’ knowledge of the
game when he ﬁrst met him.

“He plays a lot on his brains,”
Gattuso said, “but he can make
some really athletic ‘plays and
surprise you.”

Mustakas said that he won’t al-
ways be the most athletic player
on the ﬁeld, but the difference
between him and other players is
preparation. Hours spent watching
game ﬁlm and studying what the
offense does in a given situation
helps immensely, he said.

“A lot of people don’t under-
stand how important practice and
preparation are,” Mustakas said.

Drew Smith, Mustakas’ agent,
said that whereas the 6-foot-3 line-
man is a little too small to play the
inside of a four-man formation, his V
quick hands and knowledge of the l

. game make him an ideal defensive

end.

er step Friday toward expanding ,

the University.
‘ In a meeting that lasted less
than two minutes Friday morn-
ing, the Executive Committee
of Pitt’s Board of Trustees ap-
proved a $45 million proposal.
to expand ﬁve facilities on Pitt’s
main campus, one building on
the Greensburg campus and one
on the Bradford campus.

The projects the Executive
Committee approved at the

short meeting had already been ‘

approved by the Property and
Facilities Committee in February
and by the Budget Committee in
March. The full board must vote
on the projects in June before
they can go into effect.

The Executive Committee ap-

proved a plan to spend more than
$900,000 renovating the first
floor of Lothrop Hall. It also ap-
proved an expansion of the Bou-

quet’Gardens, construction in ‘

the Chevron Science Center and

* Langley Hall and renovation of

the William Pitt Union’s ninth
ﬂoor. ‘

The proposal also included a
construction plan on the Greens-
burg campus’ Smith Hall and on
the Bradford campus’ Fisher
Hall. ' ‘ '

Friday’s meeting “was pretty

procedural,” Pitt spokesmanjohn

Fedele said.

“The Budget Committee basi-
cally made sure_ that we could pay
for the plan that the Properties
and Facilities Committee said
that they wanted,” he said.

The expansion of the Bouquet
Gardens apartments is a part of
the University’s 10-year “master
plan.” -

Lateness varies by class

V 15 minutes < 1

allows students to leave class if their professor
is more than 15 minutes late.

Fedele doesn’t know the origin of this legend.
“We had the same thing in the late ’7os when I
was at Boston College,” he said. He never thought
to investigate the truth behind it though.

He said professors decide whether or not to
implement a 15-minute rule for their classes.

Professors hold their students to different
standards.

Laurel Roberts, abiology professor, said she
tries to arrive on campus an hour before her
class begins. If she’s running late, she tries to
call or e—mail a colleague and have him notify
her students. -

The amount of time she expects her students
to stay depends upon the length of her class.

“If it is a 50-minute class and I know I can’t
get there within 15 to 20 minutes of the start
time, I would probably cancel class unless that
day’s material was time sensitive,” she said in
an e—mail.

She would reconsider canceling if the class
were a 2.5-hour, once-a-week class.

English professorjennifer Lee said she would _

expect her students to give her 10 or15 minutes
to show up before they left her classroom.
“After that, Iwould understand,” she said. “I
expect mystudents to be on time, so they should
expect me to be on time.”
Seniorjanine Glasson said she had a class

in which the professor, who declined to give an .

interview, would show up 13 to 14 minutes late
every class, like clockwork. Everyone would cite
the 15-minute rule and plan on leaving. But after
several classes, the students knew the 15-minute
rule would probably never be applied.

“It was more of a vain hope that she would
be 15 minutes late,” she said.

It is understandable if a professor is seven
or eight minutes late every once in a while, she
said. But she has never actually applied the 15-
minute rule. ‘ -

Student Lindsey Kasmiroski, however, has.

It was last winter during a bad snowstorm,
and she had trouble getting to class.

“We waited 20 minutes before leaving, be-
cause we all liked the professor,” Kasmiroski
said. '

Glasson said that her professor did arrive H

and kept the class late to teach the material that
would have been covered if the professor had
been on time, throwing off her schedule.

Fedele said professors can decide for them-
selves what to do with students who leave class
early. But if a student leaves before the profes-
sor shows up, he or she is likely to be marked
absent, which could negatively affect the stu-
dents grade.

Glasson said she never approached her pro-
fessor about her tardiness, and she doesn’t know
of any classmates who did. She never tried to
make a formal complaint, either.

The dean of the School of Arts and Sciences,
N. John Cooper, said professors are subject to
responsibilities similar to those of students.
He pointed to the Academic Integrity Code,
which is listed on the Arts and Sciences website
(the other schools have similar codes on their
own sites). _

The ﬁrst half of the Academic Integrity Code
deals entirely with student obligations and re-
sponsibilities —— including timeliness. The sec-
ond half lists faculty c_onduct.

Part one of the faculty section lists 13 points

of responsibility, which states that professors are

required “to meet their classes when scheduled”
and “to make appropriate preparation for classes

The location changed after Romanus

Thursday. Students for a Democratic Soci-

the William Pitt Union and the.Cathedral of
Learning. 4
Pitt’s student chapter will meet tomor-

‘ row to discuss the ﬁxture of the organization.

The group lost its adviser, professor Tony
Novosel, last week. The group will also dis-
cuss how it will respond to the University’s
pressure to cancel the conference, Romanus

. said. Pitt’s Director of Student Life Kenyon
Bonner said he did not pressure anyone to
cancel the event.

Jordan Romanus:

ence people’s current opinions of the group.
“A lot of it has to do with historical prec-
edent. It just has certain connotations for
people who aren’t aware ofthe real facts,” said
Kathleen DiPrinzio, a Pitt freshman and mem-
ber of Students for a Democratic Society.
The national Students for a Democratic
Society became popular during the 1960s

' when it promoted civil rights and an end to

the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, some students
split from SDS and formed the Weather Un-
derground, a group known for bombing the
Pentagon and U.S. Capitol.

Romanus said that the Pitt Students for a

Democratic Society is loosely afﬁliated with '

the national organization, and is against war

“The idea thatja student organization
at Pitt even has [a terrorist]-mindset is

insulting.”

Planning for the Pittsburgh Freedom
School, which served as the Northeast Re-
gional Conference for Students fora Demo-
cratic Society, began one-and-a—half months

ago, said Alex Lotorto, a 23-year-old member s

of the national SDS. When Romanus canceled
the event a day before the conference was
scheduled to begin, Lotorto said the Thomas
Merton Center, Pittsburgh’s anti-war and so-
cial justice activist group, allowed Students
for a Democratic Society to hold sessions at
its headquarters. in Garﬁeld.

The three-day event had about 20 to 30

- attendees.
Casey Capitolo, co—founder of the Pitts- .

burgh Freedom School, said one of the school’s
goals was to bring together people of different
philosophies.

Capitolo also said that the school was an

opportunity for attendees to ﬁndnpolitical .

' enlightenment. ‘
Some members believe past actions of Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society might inﬂu-

and violence of any kind.

“The idea that a student organization at
Pitt even has [a terrorist] mindset is insult-
ing,” Romanus said. _

Amberjames, ’a junior at Roberts Wesleyan
College in Rochester, N.Y., said that Students

‘ for a Democratic Society is not limited to one
"political ideology."

Participants in the. Pittsburgh Freedom
School discussed gender identities, anti-
sweatshop campaigns, nonviolent direct ac-
tion training and union organizing. A

Students for a Democratic Society pro-
motes a participatory democracy — a de-
mocracy in which everyone has a direct say
in the organization.

Liam Swanson, a Pitt freshman and mem-
ber of Students for a Democratic_Society, said
Romanus took it upon himself to cancel the
room reservations. .

Romanus said he talked to members Mehv—
ish Ally, president of Pitt’s Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society, andjonathan LaTourelle.

nisced about their first lunch meeting to
discuss ideas for GPSA. ‘

Several other representatives shared
their sentiments, and many wished De-
vanath good luck.

They spoke in a serious tone While
speaking to the entire group, but when

‘speaking to Devanath, their faces lit up and

everyone couldn’t help but smile.

The ﬁnal portion of the event was more
formal, though the atmosphere remained
relaxed. ,

Each out-going member spoke from
behind the lectern, followed by some re-
marks from GPSA administrative assistant
David Givens, before formally welcoming
the new board member.

As part of the ceremony, Jimenez got
up to welcome Devanath as the new presi-
dent. ,

G_ivens introduced Jimenez as “the
backbone of GPSA.”

“I’m very glad to be done,”]imenez said,
as he took off his suit jacket and hung it
on the microphone stand.

The first time he met Devanath was
after the G-20 Summit. She shared his
desire to help students after the event,
he said.

“Everyone else was trying to sweep
things under the rug, and Nila was trying
to help students,” he said. And that speaks
to the type of leader she’ll be, he said.

Devanath said she is nervous to take
over, but she’s conﬁdent she has the leader-
ship skills and support she needs to suc-
ceed. ' V l

heights,” she said.

ment, said he tries to monitor professors as
much as possible.

“It is a University requirement for all of us
teachers to have observations in class, especially
for graduate student teachers,” he said, “butwe
don’t do spot checks on professors.”

He agreed that the best thing for a student

_to do if a professor is typically tardy would be

to come to the front desk of the English depart-
ment, on the ﬁfth floor of the Cathedral. He
receives any complaints students makes to the
receptionist.

“I’ve not received any complaints of tardiness
other than extenuating circumstances, such as
illness,” he said.

Another, perhaps easier, way for a student
to complain would be through the course evalu-
ations.

“We do rely on student feedback,” Twyn-
ing said.

Cooper agreed.

“We require [teachers] to maintain a teach-
ing portfolio with student and peer evaluations,”
Cooper said. “When someone suggests afaculty

He also stressed the importance of the stu-
dent course evaluations.

“I read hundreds of student comments each
semester,” he said. “This is notavacuum you are

So there are options for students when a
professoris late, but leavingthe classroom might
not be one.

SGB should work
through summer

om bringingelectronic books
Ftro students to organizing the
Green Fund, the current Stu-
dent Government Board members
have been working on some big
projects. SGB president Charlie Shull
said the spring semester is atirne for
board members to get the word out
about their projects, research those
projects and gather feedback from
students. Once the fall semester hits,
allthatplanningallows for smoother
and quicker implementation — it’s
a method that hinges its success on
future progress.

Shull estimates, however, that at
least three or four board members
—- out of nine — will remain in the
area for the summer, but for long-
term projects, the summer is no time
to leave town. Shull said the board
members need to have their projects
researched by the summer, and they
need to know how students feel about
those projects because it’s obviously
difficult to receive student feedback
when most students are gone. If they
are as prepared as they should be by
the semester’s end, board members
can signiﬁcantly ﬁirther their initia-
tives over the span of the summer.

“Summer is excellent because
things slow down in the sense that
you don’t have these new sporadic
issues [to deal with],” Shull said.
“The summer can make or break
your project.”

We hope that SGB can still advance
its initiatives with so few members
actually present on campus over the
summer. Historically, it’s not uncom-
mon for board members to leave the
area for the summer. The board is
only required to have one formal pub-
lic meeting over the summer, but if
more board members remained at
Pitt forthe break and SGB held more

meetings, it would ensure progress
on their projects and initiatives. We
believe an amendment to SGB’s con-
stitution requiring weekly meetings
and board members to remain at Pitt
for the summer would be an effective
way to maximize the potential for
progress on its projects. Shull said
the greatest obstacle the board faces
is balancing its studentworkload with
SGB duties. The summer, then, could
be a time for signiﬁcant opportunity
as class responsibilities would be al-
leviated. _

Although there would surely be
fewer attendees at public meetings
because most students are home, the
meetings would still increase trans-
parency. The current board has made
noticeable progress on becoming
more transparent, and more public
meetings would only ﬁirther this goal.
Since SGB members’ terms last one
calendar year, they should be pre-
pared to keep serving over the sum-
mer. We’re not presuming members
that go home are spendingtheir sum-
mers in languid relaxation, but if they
really possess the Pitt pride they say
they do, spending a summer focus-
ing on their projects and SGB duties
shouldn’tbe an issue. While they can

communicate through e-mail and by ~

phone, meetings in person are the
most effective way to interact.

Projects proposed on candidates’
slates are mostly long-terrn projects,
and if the board members don’t ef-
fectively implement their initiatives,
they’ve let students down. When the
fall semester arrives, we hope to see
the completion of these projects, yet
we also hope that this board and fu-
ture boards capitalize on the time and
freedom the summer can provide to
make tangible progress toward their
goals.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

NASA must take it slow

with asteroid mission

Obama’s push for a landing on an asteroid poses unique beneﬁts, problems -*

 
 
  

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Saturday marked the fortieth anniver-
sary of the end of the most suspense-
ﬁll week in the history of spaceflight.
On April 14, 1970 — ironically also
the anniversary of the sinking of me
Titanic — the Apollo 13 spacecraft
suffered a massive explosion in the
service module on its way to the moon.
Thisforced the astronauts onboard to
abort the moon landing and attempt
to return to Earth inthe lunar module.
Through the astonishing ingenuity
and endurance of the crew, as well as
Mission Control inHouston, Apollo 13
went down in history as a most pecu-
liar event: a triumphant failure.

Now, NASA faces another sort
of suspense. President Obama has

planned to ax the Constellation Pro-
gram, which was supposed to return
amanto the moon. The program the
President now proposes is consider-
ably riskier, namely, it is a mission to
land onanearby asteroidasastepping-
stone en route to Mars.

While it is admirable that the
Obama administration is asking
NASA to boldly go where no man has
gone before, rather than continuing
to routinely go where many men have
gone since 1961. But an asteroid voy-
age presents considerable technical
challenges that should be ironed out
by ﬁrst going to the moon.

First and foremost is the question

V of distance. A nearby asteroid would

be millions of miles away, ratherthan
the shorthop of only a quarter—million
miles that separate the Earth from the
moon. Those distances would require
an extremely powerﬁil rocket— pow-

erful enough not only to escape Ea1th’s
gravitational pull, butthat of the moon
aswell. '

There is also the question of time
spent in space. The weeks or months
spent travelling to an asteroid would
require the installation of radiation
shielding to protect the astronauts
from extended exposure to cosmic
rays. Life-support systems and exer-

cise equipment for the crew would '

also have to grow accordingly. These
expanded requirements would add to
the weight the mission would have to
carry, meaning the booster would have
to be even more powerful.

The size of the target itself is an-
other cause for concern. According
to the Associated Press, most of the
candidate asteroids are less than a
quarter-mile across. Although this
shouldn’t pose a problem in ﬁnding
the asteroid orbeingabletohititwith

Pop culture now a point of reference for professors

Roethlisberger’s latest alleged transgression and episodes of “Jersey Shore” have become relevant to education

Ragini Grace Gupta
Columnist

 

“Guido.”

The term comes up a lot in the so-
ciology class I am taking this semes-
ter. When talking about culture and
socialization, my professor’s primary
example for the entire lecture was
“guides.” Up until a month and a half
ago, Ihad no idea what hewastalking
about. I didn’t know what the term
meant. I didn’t know that it had been
made popular by ‘jersey Shore” and
worse, I didn’t understandthe example
and hence the topic at hand.

I’ll admit I’m not that great with
pop culture. There are plenty of times
I’ve beeninaconversationwithfriends
and didn’t understand the references
theywere making. But the notion thatl
was slightly out oftouch never cameto
me while inclass. Itwas always outside
the classroom.

This semesterwas reallyasmackin
the face. Alter beingtold by my statis-
tics professorthatlhad basically been

“living under a rock” because I didn’t _

knowofthe controversysurrounding

Ben Roethlisberger, I felt some alarm
at my unintentional disconnect. In any
other situation, the fact that I don’t
know pop culture happenings would
be at mostacausefor some social em-
barrassment and a mental note to pay
more attention to stuff going on. But
when not knowing things puts me at
a disadvantage in the classroom, the
feeling isn’t so passive. -

When lecturing about stereotypes
and image, my professor used an ex-
ample of the ‘jersey Shore” culture:
hairstyle, fashion sense, speech, etc.
I was pretty lost during that lecture.
I mean, I understood the concepts he
was discussingfromthetextbook, but
there is a reason why professors use
more general examples. Plus, when
he said “guido” for the ﬁrst time there
were quite afew laughs from myfellow
students.Iwas confused— andIdon’t
like missing out on an opportunity to
laugh.

When I ﬁnally watched a few epi-
sodes of “Jersey Shore”,out ofboredom
one weekend, it clicked. Everything
my professor had said suddenly made
perfect sense. Luckily, he used the

same example a few times later and
for each subsequent reference, I was
on board.

When my statistics professor be-
gan explaining the types of errors as-
sociated with hypothesis testing, one
ofthe veryﬁrstthings he talked about
was Roethlisberger alleged transgres-

quarterback and hehad recentlybeen
accused of sexual assault, I could’ve
focused on the important stuff which
was the point of the Steelers reference

Staying up to date with pop

sion.Thiswasworsethanthe example
in sociology. I didn’t know anything
about hypothesis training, and this
example was how my professor was
going to explain testing errors? So
while mybrainwandered offtryingto
ﬁnd some mental clue as to who “Ben”
was and awaiting another verbal clue
ﬁom my professor; I was not paying
attention to the actualtopic athand —
hypothesis testing. IfI had known that
Ben Roethlisberger was the Steelers

I’m glad I’ve realized that now. WhenI '

was inhigh schoolllistened to NPR on
the way to school so I’d be up to date
with happenings for my history class.
Granted, I didn’t know about the latest
celebrity gossip, but I did know when
Germany’s became the third largest
economy. In college, professors are
more attuned to their students, which
is actuallybetter for everybody — in-
cluding me, now that I’ve watched a
few episodes of “J ersey Shore.”

So what does this all mean‘? Re-
memberinelementary schoolweused
to get excited to write assignments in
our planners as, “have fun,” or “get a
good night’s sleep”? Guess what? You
cando thatagain. Since watching‘jer-
sey Shore” and ESPN now contribute
to our education, as does listening to
96.1 KISS FM and frequenting the
movie theater, we can now add these
activitiesinour planners aspart of our
“homework.” Not onlywillfamiliarity
with these things help solidify con-
cepts by giving us something real to
relate them to, they will also prevent
the confusion that comes fromforeign
examples in lecture. Plus doing these
things is fun: I’ll admit watching‘f]er—
sey Shore” was quite entertaining.

So now when I watch “Gossip
Gir ,” or see the next comedy in the
theater instead of doing my home-
work or studying for an exam, I will
remind myselfthat I am not actually
neglectingmy coursework, but rather
investing in it.

a missile, orbiting and/or landing on
one of these rocks poses unique chal-
lenges — like not having much gravity
to work with.

This is not to say that these chal-
lenges should be avoided. The backers
of the Obama plan are quite correct
thatanasteroidwouldbeanimportant
stop on the way to Mars. Learning how
to mine an asteroid to make rocket
fuel and other needed materials in
space would be of great use for future
missions to Mars. Miningan asteroid

approach for new space

is also a commercially lucrative pros-
pect, as some of them contain materi-
A als, such as cobalt, that are relatively
rare in Earth’s crust. Landing on an
asteroid would also have important
implications for our long—term sur-
vival. After all, if dinosaurs had been
able to land on an asteroid and divert
- it, odds are they would still be around
andall of us would still be small,ﬁrrry
and nocturnal.
However, the technical challenges
of a voyage to an asteroid are more

daunting than that of a trip to the
moon —— a trip that we haven’t made
since1972. Itwouldbe easiertotackle
the challenges in stages. The ﬁrsttime
we went to the Moon, we did so in a
series of steps. The Gemini missions
were focused on dockingprocedures,
seeing ifhumans could survive in space
forthe time required fora moonshot,
and so forth. There were four Apollo
missions that were manned and did
not land on the moon: Apollo 7 tested
the new command module, Apollo

8 orbited the moon, Apollo 9 and 10
tested the lunar module.

Before we aim for an asteroid, we
should focus on the intermediate step
ofamoon landing. This missionwould
allow us to recapture the skills that
have been lost in the nearly 40 years
since we last went. A moon launch
would serve as an important test for
the technology we would use to go
to an asteroid. After all, it would be
inﬁnitely preferable to see a poten-
tially catastrophic failure en route to

mission

the Moon, where there would at least
be some hope of returning the astro-
nauts alive, than to have an equally
bad failure occur beyond the moon,
where a return might take aweek and
the chances of survival would be less.

So, as we celebrate the success-
ful return of Apollo 13, let us urge the
President to reconsider, and let us go
back to the object thatwe haven’t seen
up close for nearly 40 years.

Elay stays true to young characters

The Prime Stage Theatre’s production of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ has two local teenagers playing the title roles.

Alison Smyth
Staﬂ" Writer

Prime Theatre’s production of “Ro—
meo and Juliet” tries something a
little untraditional —— 17-year-olds
Jeremy Hois and Jenna Lanz, who
are still in high school, play the title
characters.

Director Lora Oxenreiter said
when she agreed to direct the play
that she wanted teenagers for the

roles.

“[That is] hardly, if ever, done
because the roles are so iconic and
so deep in the range of emotion that
they have to play that most com-
panies will go with adult actors,”
Oxenreiter said.

The age of the actors does not
matter as long as they excel in their
roles, she said. Oxenreiter works
mostly with high school students as
an acting coach and director of high
school musicals. The process is the

same at any age, she said.

Aside from a few nights in re-
hearsals and performances and
choosing homework over hanging
out in their spare time, Lanz and
Hois face the same challenges all
actors face. As modern teenagers,
their lives are very different from
those of their characters.

“We wouldn’t be as rash in our
thinking today. They jump to con-
clusions really quickly. Romeo,
hours after he ﬁnds out Juliet is
dead, kills himself. Sorry, Iwouldn’t
do that for [Lanz],” Hois said jok-
ingly.

Instead, they relate to their
characters by trying to imagine
how they would react as a 13-year-
old girl and 16-year-old boy. If the
events happened now, they feel the
story would turn out differently.

“The biggest thing withjuliet is
that her parents are trying to set her
up with a person that she doesn’t
want to be with. Which I don’t think
that happens [anymore]. My par-
ents probably wouldn’t expect to be
married at the age of 13. Or 17. Or

20. Or 22. I think it’s different now .

From acting to boxing and back again

Mickey Rourke, soon to be seen as a villain in ‘Iron Man 2, ’ has had a long and enduring career, and it’s not over yet

Andy Tybout
Columnist

There’s one man, and one man
only, who I’ll be rooting for when
I watch the upcoming “Iron Man
2,” and it isn’t the one in red ar-
mor — it’s the villain. Or, more
speciﬁcally, the actor in the vil-
lain’s suit.

Mickey Rourke, known best to
my generation as haggard Randy
“the Ram” from “The Wrestler”
(2008) and the grizzled anti-hero

Marv in “Sin City” (2005), has
endured a career dip and resur-
gence so remarkable it’s a super-
human feat in itself.

At the beginning of his career
Rourke moved to New York City
to study acting because, as he
told The New York Times, “I liked
that you could escape who you
were and be someone else, some-
one smarter, tougher.”

And for a time, he got exactly
what he wanted — after land-
ing a part in Steven Spielberg’s
“1941” (1979), Rourke became

a Hollywood sex symbol —— a
brawling, seductive anti-hero
hailed by critics for his roles in
“Diner” (1982) and “Body Heat”

(1981). Although you wouldn’t
know it now, the man was more
a soft-faced ladies.’ magnet than
a hardened anti-hero.

Although you wouldn’t knowit, the
man was more a sofbfacedltadies’
magnet than a hardened hero.

But by the time the ’90s kicked

in, Rourke had begun to slip into
mediocre roles — landing more
duds than scene-stealers. Not
only that, he allegedly turned
down parts in classics like “Pulp
Fiction” (1994), “Tombstone”
(1993) and “The Silence of the
Lambs” (1991).

Perhaps in an effort to retain

his status as someone “tougher”
Rourke decided to largely forgo
acting for a career in boxing.
Only, “career” might be too gen-
erous a term — during this dark

Among the plethora of female British singers
that have risen in popularity over the past
few years, I never considered Kate Nash one
of my favorites. I found her voice irritating
and her lyrics a little too cutesy for my lik—'
ing. “Pumpkin Soup” was a ﬁm song, but
her last album, Made of Bricks, just didn’t
do it for me.

That’s why it’s so surprising thatl enjoyed
her second album, My Best Friend Is You, so
much. It doesn’t stray too far from the for
mula that propelled her to fame in the ﬁrst
place, but she has taken on a more mature

sound and her songwriting skills seem to
be improving.

The ﬁrst single off the album, “Do—Wah—
D00,” is maddeningly catchy. The staccato
bursts in Nash’s music are reminiscent of

seat singing, and they appear frequently ‘

on the album. “Take Me to a Higher Plane”
sounds a bit-too similar to “Do—Wah—Doo,”
but at least it is pleasant—sounding repeti-
tion.

‘The Wrestler’ revitalized a dying career

Tybout 4 8

recess, Rourke’s performances in the ring
were met with media scorn. In 1994, World
Boxing magazine asked, “Mickey Rourke:
Acting Like a Boxer  or Boxing Like an
Actor?” I ~

Still, Rourke seemed, at least on the
surface, content. In an interview with the
UK TV series “The Word,” he "declared,
amidst characteristic smack—talk, “I do
what I want to do, whether it’s off the wall
or not.” a

That, at least, was inarguable. But dur-

‘ ing the early ’90s both movie and boxing

fans alike derided the once-respected
performer.

Caught in this self—imposed quagmire,
Rourke decided to once again throws his
fate to Hollywood.

It worked — sort of. Francis Ford
Coppola gave him a small part in ‘—‘The
Rainmaker” (1997), but until 2008, he
continued to toll in relative obscurity.

_And then came “The Wrestler.” If you
haven’t seen this movie, watch it. If you’ve
already seen it, watch it again. If you’re an
aspiring actor, take notes. This is perhaps
the most authentic portrait of a broken
spirit in recent cinema history.

Rourke’s character, Randy the Ram
Robinson, was a man weathered by time
— his voice lower by degrees, his face

PAALGA 

‘ mi 2;:-"§:'€:.l-;-§.~‘:£' '5

encrusted with wrinkles.

He was, by any standard, a has—been
— forgotten by‘ the ring and his fans. In
other words, Rourke played himself.

Unlike Randy, however, Rourke’s career
underwent a subsequent rejuvenation as
critics unanimously hailed his perfor-
mance as a tour de force.

Now, after multiple identity shifts,
Rourke can best be described as a tough-
talking elder, an impassioned dog enthu—
siast and, most importantly, a respected
actor with a buoyant career.

Still, it probably took a harrowing fall ’

like that of his ’90s boxing fling/to success-

fully portray the characters he does now: -

crusty, weary has—beens — inhabiting the
current crop of Clint Eastwood characters
better than the man himself. '

This is, in the end, Rourke’s ultimate
strength: experience. He’s been there. He’s
suffered indignities and losses other actors
must only emulate. He’s become smarter.

He’s become tougher. And it’s made him, g

for a lack of a better word, real. V

This isn’t to say Rourke can’t relapse
into more mediocre roles, or suffer some
renewed outburst of embittermentl

But for now audiences may glimpse
what’s now a rare thing in Hollywood: an
actor being himself.

Draft 4 1

The defensive end in the four-
man formation does “a lot of the
dirty work,” Mustakas said.

He would be responsible for
holding a gap on every play,
sometimes holding off two of-
fensive linemen at a time, while
the defensive tackle would make
many of the plays.

Gattuso feels confident in
Mustakas’ ability, even though
he might be undersized for the
position.

“I’m sure he could learn either

Gattuso:

any player, Gattuso said, but the
severity of the injury and the re-
covery time go up for the larger
players.

“It can be devastating,” Gat-
tuso said, “but by the second half
of senior year, [Mustakas] was
playing as well as he ever did.”

CBS Sports projected that
Mustakas will go into free agency
or short—term tryout contracts
with a team rather than be se-
lected in the draft. Smith said
that there is a sharp drop-off in

ever did.

the inside or the outside,” Gat-
tuso said.

Mustakas talks a lot with his
hands. Sitting on a bench in the
mostly- quiet first floor of the Ca-
thedral of Learning, he talked
about how he prepares for each
game.

When the offense lines up, he
watches closely for any “little
hint” of what the offense might
do. When a lineman leans a shoul-
der “just a few inches more” to
the left or right, Mustakas tries to
pick up on it, he said, and ﬁgure
out where the offense will go.

Mustakas entered this year’s
draft partly because of a knee
injury his junior year that kept
him out of all but two games in
the 2007 season. He said that the
injury hurt his draft chances in
the past year.

“When they say ‘Gus Mustakas’
the first thing they think about is
my knee,” Mustakas said.

Mustakas wanted to move
past his knee injury this year,
and so he made the All—Big East
defensive second team, racking
up 38 tackles — nine for a loss
of yardage ——— and two fumble
recoveries.

Knee injuries are serious for

the amount of money awarded to
free agents and tryout players.

Smith projected that Musta-
kas would be a late~round draft
pick, or a free agent.

Mustakas said that signing as
a free agent has its upside. He
would be able to sign with which-
ever team he chooses and pick
a team where he feels he would
ﬁt in well.

Smith said that Mustakas
would fit in well with several
teams, including the Miami Dol-
phins and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Mustakas said he’d love to play in
Pittsburgh, although he is origi-
nally from Florida, and “isn’t too
happy with the winters.”

Gattuso thinks that Mustakas
will really shine in the spring
training sessions with whatever
team he signs, even if he doesn’t
get drafted. Mustakas works
hard, Gattuso said, and learns
quickly.

For this year’s senior class, it
might be their last chance to play
in the NFL.

“It’s every senior’s dream to
go on to the NFL,” Smith said,
“but the chances of getting draft-
ed go down by about 25 percent

time is a big deal.”

Smith said that although
agents advise those who didn’t
get drafted to check out other



leagues, many “eventually have
to give up the dream.”

Just having players enter the
draft, Gattuso said, is a great

<
thing for Pitt. They always try
to get as many players into the
NFL as possible, and it is “great
for recruiting.”

Defense strong in
game

Sean Coyne I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Tino Sunseri emerged as a leader in the Spring Game held at Heinz Field this weekend,
but the defense dominated the offense in a modiﬁed scoring system.

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬂ" Writer

The annual Pitt Blue—Gold game marks the
end of spring practice, and on Saturday
at Heinz Field it also marked a win for
the defense.

The first and second team defenses
looked dominant for most of the day as
they limited the offense to just one touch-
down. They won the game 62-24 as part of
a modiﬁed scoring system that awarded
defensive points for sacks, interceptions,
tackles for a loss and other defensive cat-
egories.

Although defensive stars like Greg
Romeus and Dan Mason looked strong
once again, it was the guys below them
on the depth chart that really stood out
to Coach Dave Wannstedt.

“Some of our defensive lineman that
are in our backup roles that we need to
come through for us to be good, I thought
they showed up today,” Wannstedt said.

He cited backup linemen Nate Nix and
Shayne Hale in that group of players. They
were tied for the team high in tackles with
six each, along with linebacker Tristan
Roberts. Nix also led the defense with
three tackles for a loss. p

Even with the defense getting the better
of its counterpart for much of the day, the
offense made some notable plays.

Quarterback Tino Sunseri looked Jon
Baldwin’s way early and oftenlas he led
the team with four catches for 37 yards.
Meanwhile, All—Big East running back Dion
Lewis ﬁnished with 74 yards on only five
carries, highlighted by a 52-yard dash.

“For the most part on offense we tried
to getjon and Dion the ball early,” Wannst-
edt said.

Sunseri Takes Over

One of the main storylines this spring is
the speculation about who would emerge
from the duo of Sunseri and Pat Bostick

Without ﬁirther ado, congratulations to Brett
Favre.

Favre took it to another level in 2009-10.
He supplied sports columnists with enough
material to make poorlyworded puns for nearly

“seven years, and he’s thinking about doing it
again next year.

Just two weeks ago, smack in the middle of
the off-season, Favre whipped up a midnight
snack for the media when he announced that
his 21-year-old daughter Brittany gave birth
to a healthy baby boy. He’s now a grandfather.
Sometimes you don’t even need a punch line

Montreal, especially, looks like it could ruin

Awards Handed Out

» Before the game, the team announced _~

that receiver Greg Cross and cornerback
Antwuan Reed received the Ed Conway

Award for the most improved player over

the course of spring practice.

The award was meaningful for Cross,
but he knows that there remains plenty of
work to be done.

“Getting the award was OK. I’m very ‘

humble, so it just motivates me even
more,” Cross said. “I’m'hungry to continue
what I’ve done.”

Cross was impressive this spring and

took big strides toward winning the job ,

of the team’s No. 3 receiver, whereas Reed
looks like a starter at cornerback.

Reed can also make an impact on spe-
cial teams as he blocked a field goal on
Saturday. ' .
