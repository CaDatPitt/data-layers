Residents Speak Out onFive Day Dorm Visitation Policy 

By CYNTHIA COHEN
Pitt News Staff Writer _

Recent claims by Tower B
residents that Sidney Brinkley,
suspect in the murder of-Monica
Renee Jones, lived in a Towers
dormitory for over two months has
:led to students- questioning the
ﬁve-day visitation policy.

University regulations stipulate
that any resident student, except
those living on intensive study/

reduced-visitation floors, may have _

guests for a period up to ﬁve days.
Many residents surveyed in a‘
Pitt News straw poll said itwas not
the amount of time that creates any
problem. Adequate enforcement of
the policy and some provision for
guest registration, other than one
sign"-in book at the main desk
where registration of both short-
term and long-term guests is

jumbled together, seem to be the
key to closing up any loopholes in
the visitation policy, students say.
The following are responses to
the question: What do you think of
the ﬁve-‘day visitation policy?

doesn’t matter what kind of policy‘

A they have.

Sonja Currie, sophomore: . “I
don't see how _they arrived at five
days. They should make some kind
of provision so that if someone is
staying ﬁve days his host should
have to notify_some authority.”

Carl Krzywiec, freshman: "I
think ._it’s too long. I can see
visitations for a weekend, but you
have to watch the kids (resi-
dents).”

Venecia Bessellieu, sophomore:

“I think it’s all right.”

Luke Martinez, freshman: “I

think it’s too short.” ‘

Greg Blum, freshman: “Five

Achievement, affiliation and
power are .the basic needs that
athletes look’ to fulﬁll in team

' sports’, said Dr. Joyce Alexander,

staff psychologist and associate
professor, in a lecture Friday."
Speaking on the psychological

development of athletes, Alexan- ‘

der said athletes fulﬁll their need
for achievement by competing for

-positions on the team and by

overcoming the risks they are daily

. confronted with in their respective

sports.

Being identiﬁed with an exclu-
sive group satisﬁes the need for
afﬁliation, she said. Power is
meted out in terms of the physical

‘ powieriathletes feel while compet-

ing as well as the -psychological
power they have over individuals
by their prestigious association

with an exclusive group.

Alexander went on ‘to identiy
several areas where she believes
many athletes have problems, the
first of which she calls the “id
aspect of functioning.’.’ ,

In this area, the athlete operates
according to felt needs at the
moment and is concerned with the
reality of the situation or the
rightness‘ or wrongness of it,
Alexander said.

This manner of operating may‘

cause_ serious adjustment, prob-
lems, she claimed’ once the

is finished.

Alexander also stressed the
extent to which denial operates.’

“Occasionally, athletes are
maneuvered in to a decision (about
sports) while they are
exploring, before they realize what
needs they‘ are meeting.
wards it is hard to be introspective
and they end up denying what may
have been an unacceptable motiva-
tion to sports.”

Often these early decisions result
in feelings of ambivalence and

’ dilemma.- “The athlete fears that

all his self-worth ‘is tied in with his

commented on another cause of
conﬂict among athletes.

-“To incoming athletes, the
verbal message is student ﬁrst,

athlete second,- but as the»athlete~-~ ~   

sees it rewards and challenges are
mete out solely in terms of sports.”

Alexander also made mention of
the courseshe instructs titled “The
Psychology of Sports.” The main
aim of the course, she says, is to

get the student to look, at himself, .

his goals and his desires. Although
the course is limited to athletes
only, Alexander says that. students
are chosen so there is “Enough
commonality, but some differences
individually, so that they can learn
from each other.” 4

What Happens to Those
SGB Proposals?     . 

By JEFFREY OLUP A

‘I The Student Government Board,
which serves as mediator between
students and administration, car-

ries a goodly amount of clout, but is __
x subject to the imperfections of the

system.

One problem that concerns SGB
is the amount of time. it takes for
proposals to be implemented,
which leads to the question: What
happens to proposals once they are
initiated by'the SGB? I ’

Plans brought to the attention of
the board and considered worthy of
action are passed, through a
majority vote of the seven
members, then referred to the
appropriate University depart-
ment. From there, the board can
only hope to sell its ideas to the
different levels of authority, with

' n6’real assurance of success.

“Anyone throughout the chan-

nels can sit on any proposal and I

lose it,” said board member Todd
Park. “Things get buried through
administrative process, and all bills
have to go through channels.”

One plan currently going
through channels is the $10.5

" ._ million proposed ‘Schenleyx Hall I
J reeévatiensr :Th¢.rs°ti9n hés been

- seven years. ’

they call sbureaucracy.” s ._ s‘ _;

    
  
  

in the development stages nearly-IE5.

“It’s a slow process” said Park. I _
He pointed out the path of 
suggestion he initiated concerning” '
a recommendation to raise the 
activity fee, which has .remained   '-
the same since 1970.

Student Government has
$275,000 at its disposal from fall‘ ,
activityfees that Park said could be . ‘ - 
a much higher ﬁgure if his proposal‘
is implemented. The idea was ﬁrst
suggested by park last year and no 7 = '-

action has been taken to date.

“The plan would have to pass ,
through the director of student’
activities (Andy Smith), then to‘
Vice Chancellor (Conney Akimbo),
who deals with student affairs, , ,
then to Senior Vice Chancellor. 
(Jack reeman), then to Chancellor 
Posvar. And if he can be sold, the
proposal must then ‘pass to the -
Board of Trustees.” :

 

 

This process is the usual route
taken by any proposal made by
SGB. And, as pointed out by Park,‘
each individual department must '
be sold on the idea before it maygo
on to the next level. . .

‘.‘And that,”-the added. ,“is what-,4; ..

- By The Associated Press
. WASHINGTON—The nation’s
capital, which views large gather-

 I ings as a way of life, is braced for
p’ what promises to be the biggest

one ever, the mass on the Mall
‘celebrated by Pope John Paul 11.
Since no pope has ever visited

. .here before, no one knows how
’ _ many people to expect for the visit

of John Paul II Oct. 6-7. But church
leaders say they expect from
500,000 to a million people to crowd
onto the Capitol Mall next Sunday
afternoon. And no one is arguing.

The archdiocese of Washington,
which includes the District of
Columbia and its Maryland sub-
urbs, has about 400,000 Catholics.
But the pope’s weekend visit will
draw from all over the East,
providing Catholics and non-
Catholics with a once-in-a-lifetime
chance to participate in a mass
celebrated by a pope.

The expected crowd would be
greater than the quarter-million
who heard Martin Luther King Jr.
declare “I Have a Dream” in 1963;

-_.-——

it would be bigger than the largest
of anti-war demonstrations during
the Vietnam War era.

“The Bicentennial in 1976 was a
ﬁreworks display,” with spectators
spread all over a large downtown
area including ‘the Mall, said
George Berklacy, spokesman for
the National Park Service, which
supervises Mall events. “We

_estimated that] million people saw

it. But the pope promises to attract
more people in one place than this
city has ever seen.”

Slowing down is more than
just a safer way to drive. It’s also
a great way to save gas and
money. You’ll get about 20 more
miles from every tank of gas if
you slow down from 70 to 55 mph
on the highway. And that's just
one of the easy ways you can save
gasoline.

another 20 a gallon. And a well-

. tuned car can save you about 40 a

gallon more. _

Saving energy is easier than
you think, and with the rising
energy costs we're facing today,
it's never been more important.

For a free booklet with more easy

energysaving tips, write

The trick is where to put
them—where to park their cars and
buses, where they'll eat, sleep and
go to the bathroom, where they'll
stand to hear the pope, where
they'll sit and wait to see him.

Sports fans have been paciﬁed.
The Redskins football game,
scheduled to be played the same
afternoon at the RFK Stadium a
few blocks from the Mall, has been
switched to Philadelphia. ,

As a result, those attending the
Mass ‘can park their cars in the
stadium parking lot and ride the
subway to the Mall. There will also
be parking at the Pentagon, with
shuttle buses going to the Mall.

The two-hour ‘mass, which will
be televised by ABC, starts at 3
p.m. Church officials say the altar
will be high enough for everyone
standing on the ‘Mall to see the

pontiff. They insist also that the H

sound pystem will allow everyone
along tle grassy mile-and-a-half
mall between the Capitol steps and

events, the pope’s visit has

The pope’s visit to the United
States begins Oct. 1 in Boston and
ends in Washington on Oct. 7.
During the six days he will also
visit New York, Philadelphia, Des

stay will be two days in Chicago

   Attitude Shifts‘
 On Mass Transit

 

State Senator James Romanelli (D—South Park)
has sugges.ted to the Senate Committee on Transpor-
tation _one'method of funding for transit authorities
that could make it easier for the financially strained
public companies to operate. Now, Pennsylvania
underwrites the authorities by giving them enough
funds to cover the deficit theyincur every year, and
Romanelli proposes that the state give transit systems
two-thirds of this money in July so that they can
plan their budgets better.

Romanelli’s idea sounds sensible. Transit
authorities across Pennsylvania never know how
much money they will receive from the state until
their fiscal year is two-thirds over. By that time, the

authorities cannot-use the funds to expand services. ‘

Romanelli’s plan would eliminate the problem by ad-
vancing two-thirds of the appropriations to the
authorities in July when they need it.

The proposal is even more important because it is a

«part of the emergingrealization in the United States

that we can no longer depend on the single-family car
as the main means of daily transportation. This
summer’s‘long lines at gas stations, soaring fuel
prices and stop-gap measures like even-odd rationing
to deal with the crisis showed that the United States
must find alternatives to the offspring of Henry
Ford’s ‘Model T if it is not to be the victim of the
vicissitudes of the international oil market.

This shift of attitude has taken a long time to

‘ oil -companies‘.

the Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970,
spending for public transportation meant spending
for new highways. While Congress poured billions
of dollars into road building" during the 1950s and
19605, public bus, "trolley, train and subway systems
were the bastard sons of government, first ignored
and then forgotten. "Many deteriorated in the large
cities and those in smaller urban areas simply went
bankrupt. That policy has led the United States to a
dependence on foreign oil and an interstate highway
system we could afford to construct, but not to main-
tain. ’

challenges trying to fund public transportation. In-
ﬂation and increased usage make transit systems
more expensive _to operate, and policy makers must
find methods to fill the increasing gap between the
cost and the actual earnings of transit authorities, a
space that may have to be closed by the complete
public funding of these companies.

Such measures will come some day. if everyone
recognizes that the energy problems of the United
States are more than artificial manipulations by the
The root ‘of the problem is the
overuse of the family automobile. If Romanelli’s
proposal is sincere, and not merely grandstanding to
take advantage of a politically_ “Hot” issue, the tran-
sition from the automobile to a fiscally solvent and
well‘-maintained public transit system will be a much
easier one. '

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
CHAPEL HILL, N. C.--Pitt’s
1.7-7 loss to North Carolina
Saturday was disturbing for many
reasons.’ ‘

‘Primarily, it was one more
disappointmentin a line of losses
against better than average
opponents. Pitt has had trouble
beating good teams the last few
years. Annual losses to Notre
Dame (now off the schedule) and
Penn State are commonplace, but

I the Panthers had trouble with a ,

good Navy. team last year, Florida
two seasons past, North Carolina
State and now the Tar Heels.

Pitt fans are hard to please. A
7-4 season is no longer considered
a success, especially when the
team fails to pull pff what might
considered upsets. And Coach
Jackie Sherrill will have to answer
those critics as the season goes
.along.

What was most disappointing
was the play of Pitt’s offense.
Having looked impressive in the
opening win over Kansas, the
Panthers gave notice they were a
team to/be reckoned with. But the
‘Panthers were extremely erratic on
offense Saturday, and they seemed
to lack the poise and consistency
necessary to win games.

After falling behind 14-0 in the
first quarter, Pitt abandoned its

game plan (Randy McMillan and ‘a-

few passes) and ﬁlled the air with
errant passes and interceptions.
Rick Trocano threw three to the
wrong team, while Dan Marino
added one on the last play of the
ﬁrst half, a desperation toss down
the far sideline.

All tolled, Pitt turned the ball
over seven times, and according to
Sherrill, “You're not gonna turn
the ball over and win.”

1 ‘ 'V“There was running in our game

plan,” “Sherrill insisted. “But we
threw the ball more than /we
«wanted to.”
‘ ‘J ‘ McMillan carried the ball only 11
times for 34 yards, while Fred

By JEFF DUROSKO

Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor

Despite the overwhelming odds
against them, the Pantherette
volleyball team completed a west
coast tour thisweekend on a good
note.‘ Pitt finished in a tie for

I‘ seventh place at-the 20-team San

Diego Invitational. Overall, on the
trip, Pitt had a record of 2-8-3.
“The record sounds dismal,”
said head coach Mike Hebert, “but
something that has to be said is we
played the best volleyball we've
every placed. Although we lost
eight matches, we gained a lot of
respect for our program. Those

» teams weren’t just walking all over
us

ﬁﬁ
-

After their swing through
Hawaii, Pitt faced fourth-ranked
San Diego State in a dual match
last Thursday night. The,Panther-
ettes lost the match 15-5, 15-10,

. 15-5.

“We played strongly. and the

T match was a lot closer than the
score indicates,”

said Hebert.
“San Diego State is a good
blocking team and again, fatigue
hampered our play.”

Throughout the trip, Pitt was
hurt by fatigue as they played each
night of’ the nine day tour, usually

,. after spending a good part of the

day traveling.

Jacobs, who doesn’t appear to be
as “Fast” as before, gained 41

' yards on 13 attempts.

Defensively, Pitt played well.
Except for confusion in the

‘secondary that enabled UNC’s

Matt Kupec to hit Phil Farris with a
43 vard touchdown pass, Pitt was

able to hold the Tar Heels in check.

UNC punted the ball 13 times, and
punter Steve Streater, whose
brother Jimmy plays quarterback
at Tennessee, kept Pitt pinned

deep in its own territory for much '

of the afternoon.
“I thought the play of our

specialty teams was the key to the
game,” said UNC Coach Dick
Crum.

Conversely, Pitt’s specialty
teams have left something to be
desired thus far this season. '“ Dave
Trout averaged 37 yards a punt
Saturday, which is respectable, but

The Panther offensive in general and center Russ Grimm in particulariwere
injured in Saturday's 1 7-7 loss to North Carolina. "

“When we arrived in San Diego,
we only had time for about two
hours of sleep before we had to
begin preparations for the match,”
said the coach. “Then we had to

_ get up the next morning to start the

tournament.”

In the first round of the
invitational, Pitt played UCLA, who
eventually took top honors in the
tournament. The Pantherettes lost
the first game to the Bruins 15-11,
but rallied to record a win in game
two, 15-10." -

“We won convincingly,” said
Hebert.
In fact, we were the only team to
take a game from UCLA in the
entire tournament.”

Hebert lauded the blocking of
Cindy Chambers and the hitting of
Paula ‘Olsen in the UCLA match.
He added that Kathy Sonricker
played outstanding defense and
freshman Ellen Mangus did a great
job.

“Here she (Mangus) is, starting
in her first intercolegiate competi-
tion against all these great teams,

. and_ she played great volleyball,”

Hebert said. ,

Pitt then went on to Play Texas
and also split the match with the
Longhorns. Texas, powered by a

' strong blocking game, won the first

 

. g , , L,
  

“It wasn't just a ﬂuke-

game 15-8, ‘while Pitt won the
second 15-9. ' '

Fresno State provided the next
competition, and after they
pounded Pitt 15-2; the Pantherettes
came back with a 15-8.victory.

In the last match, of pool play,
Pitt faced Arizona, having to win
both games to make it to
championship play. The Panther-
ettes were up to the test, defeating
the Wildcats 15-11, 15-8.

“Most pre-tournament thoughts
were that we’d lost to Arizona,”
and never make the play-offs”,
said'Heberts. “In fact, to show the
strength of the tournament, two-
time national champions USC
never even made the playoffs.”

In the quarter finals, Pitt again
faced San Diego State, the

tournament’s number one seed. ~

State downed the Pantherettes in
two straight games _15-7, 15-4.

Pitt then played the University of
California at Santa Barbara in a
consoluation match for ﬁfth place.
UCSB defeated Pitt in a hotly
contested game 16-14 that literally
knocked the windout of the Pitt
attack. The Pantherettes lost the
second game 14-4.

“Had we won the first game, I’m
sure that we would have taken the
match,” said Hebert. “For the
first time during the entire trip, the

girls were just totally fatigued,
totally wiped out.” »

UCLA won the tournament, San
Diego State was, second, Long.
Beach State third, Brigham Young
fourth and _UCSB ﬁfth. '

“All in all, we’re very pleased-
with our showing,” said Hebert.
“The swing through the islands-
really helped our performance at
San Diego.” 5

According to Hebert, last year’s
team could have very possibly gone
0-8 in the pool in which Pitt
ﬁnished at 5-3. ‘

“Even with our Eastern champ-
ionship team, we could have very
well not won a single game,” he
said. “

Hebert said that one of the main
purposes of the trip was to toughen
up the team and to transfer that
ability against eastern competition.

» “But,” he said, “So many other
Eastern teams are getting better
that our season won’t be a cake
walk despite this trip.”

Spiker’s Notes: Another sign of
the depth of media coverage’ was
the live television coverage of the
San Diego Invitational...Hebert
said that in San Diego, crowds of

up to 5,000 show up for a dual-

match, 7 '_ V

na ﬁner in 17-7 Panther Defeat

he, too, has been inconsistent. The
Panthers, have not shown much in
the area of punt and kickoff returns
either. As coaches like to say, the
kicking game is just as important as
the offense and defense, and to_ be’
blunt, Pitt has had a good defense,
but lessthan average restiifs from
the offense and specialty teams.

If it can stay healthy, the defense
should continue to be a much better
than average unit. The defensive
line is excellent, although there is a
glaring lack of depth with the injury
to Jim Covert. ’ A

With Jeff Pelusi ﬁt, and the
coaches using the revolving door
system with the remaining line-
backers, the Panthers shouldn’t
encounter too many problems
there.

As it continues to play together,
the secondary should become a
‘quality group, one with good
quickness and football savvy.

The past ﬁve or six seasons, Pitt
always has been deep at the skilled
positions. Players such as Tony
Dorsett, Elliott Walker, Gordon
Jones, Matt Cavanaugh and .Jim
Corbett were players with big-play
potential, players who could break
a big gainer from any spot on the
field. '

A look at this year’s offense
indicates no player of that caliber is"
present, at least not on the ﬁrst
team with the possible exception of
Benjie Pryor. Two players who
possess that kind of game-breaking
potential, Maririo and wide receiv-
er Julius Davckins,“ “are second-

. stringers. "Both are also freshmen,

so‘ their contributions aren’t to be
expected sosoon. In time, they
could become an outstanding.
passing combination. But for now,
they’re still freshmen.

Finally, after a month of
practice and three_ consecutive 1-0
losses," the Pitt soccer team scored
a victory‘ of sorts. Although the
game endediin a 3-3 tie against
Slippery Rock, the Panthers proved
themselves capable of scoring
goals. "

The Slippery‘ Rock contest is
always hotly contested. Two years
ago, the teams tied and Slippery
Rock cameout on top last season by
scoring in the game’s final
moments.

Friday, Slippery Rock got on the
board early in the game as Tom
Kulick scored’ after 1:25 had
elapsed.‘ The Panthers and starting
goalkeeper Greg Blum were
stunned by the score, but quickly
rebounded when Panther Jeff
Tissue scored the first Pitt goal of
the season 13 minutes later.

After six minutes of pressure to
the Slippery Rock defense, the

- 4 Panthers were on the board again‘

when midfielder Al Adelmann
received a head pass "from
freshman Tom Trempus. Adel-
niann reacted quickly and put the

a ball in for a Pitt lead. Trempus,

only a recent starter, looked to be
getting over freshman adjust-
ments.

The Panthers were set back
towardtthe end of second half when
Slippery Rock tied the score on a
goal by Tom Hayes. At this point,
coach Leo Bemis chose to insert a
new goalie, Mark Robertson. The
move turned out to be sound as

‘Robertson turned, in an effective
performance. —

The second half ended just as the
first had, 2-2, forcing the teams to
play two 10-minute overtime
periods. During the second half,
an apparent Slippery Rock goal was
erased when Gerry Hendershop
was called for obstruction at the
time of the shot, thus canceling the
score. A" lucky break for the
Panthers.

The Pitt midfielders were able to
and ‘

take . control of the ball
produced some fine shots on goal.
Here, Panther Danny Hamm was
instrumental. Midfielder Hamm,
whoplayed his first two seasons as
a fullback, was switched at the
beginning of the season.- ' The
transition of learning the new
position was quick, and Hamm has

"been one of the more hustling and

aggressive Panthers this season.
With seven minutes gone in the
first overtime period, Slippery

‘Rock's Kulick scored his second

goalloff a pass from Ed Molina.
The Panthers appeared to be on

But with only 17 seconds elapsed’ - I

in the second period, Hamm V
passed to Jeff Tissue, who went

one-on-one with the Rocket goalie‘_ '3'
' and came out the victor. I . __ A
“When I saw Tissue score that - l ’ "

goal  must have jumped ﬁve feet

off the ground/,’ said Robertson. ‘v‘I ‘

know we have the ability to score a ‘

lot more than we have, and I’m‘ ‘

sure that we will in our following-
games.” ’ . , g
The game ended on a happy
note. The Panthers were able to
gain some much-needed conﬁ-
dence in goal-scoring tactics. This
should prove ‘essential for next
week’s contests_ against Carnegie-
Mellqn and'Temple. 
Changes in personnel and
attitude“ were evident. Panther I
