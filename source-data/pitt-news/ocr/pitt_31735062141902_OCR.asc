Takes Place Wednesday at
Heinz House

 

Reproductions of more than 30 mod-
ern paintings will 'be exhibited in the
University’s first art show at the
Heinz House next Wednesday, accord-

professor of ﬁne arts. The paintings

have been chosen from among the .

best in modern art interpretation and
will be the ﬁrst eﬁort of the ﬁne arts
department to place exhibits on a
larger scale than formerly.

Mr. Hovey believes "that students
at the University should be given an
opportunity to see the best work be-
ing done in modern painting. Assist-
ed by Henry E. Scott, J12, assistant
professor of ﬁne arts, and Ralph Bar-
ton Perry, cataloguer of photographs
in the department of ﬁne arts, he has
chosen thirty of the paintings in the
collection of the University depart-
ment for exhibition Wednesday. The
three men will be the speakers at the
exhibit, pointing out the trends in the
various paintings which will be hung.

The prints will represent the trend
in modern painting starting with the
impressionism of the nineteenth cen-
tury including to the more radical de-
partures.,in. art of the..present. day.
The University library of ﬁne arts
contains one of the country's ﬁnest
collections of modern paintings.

Artists from twelve foreign coun-
tries will ‘be represented at the show.
The selection of the prints was su-
pervised by Dr. Frederick M. Clipp,
head of the department of ﬁne arts,
who at present is“ in New York col-
lecting additional material for the
University ﬁne arts library.

Depressidn Cause
Of Play: Slump,
Says Kenyon

 

Plays in New jYor1t do not call
for much scholarly analysis, says
Elmer Kenyon, head of the Tech
drama department who addressed
the Women’s Association at the
College Club, Wpglnesday on,“_’Ijl__1e__,__
Best Plays in New York. “There
was a slump in plays ‘before
the depression came on, but its
appearance aided greatly in km-
ing -good plays. Great plays come
when people are bound together
homogeneously—~when they are
held by some great feeling. Just
now there is no single mind in the
theater. Playwrights are not
such great people that they can
write plays which will appeal to
everyone.

Mr. Kenyon reviewed several
of the most talked of plays now
running in New York, “Dinner
At Eight” by Edna Ferber and
George S. Kaufman, which is
probably the most popular play in
New York this season, is a caustic
kind 'of satire at ‘the' upper
classes who think of nothing but
social life. “Dangerous “Corners”
by J. B. Priestly, is another con-
temporary play which deals with
the degeneracy of the morals of
the English upper class. Mr.
Kenyon also reviewed Rachel
Crothers’ “W'hen Ladies Meet,”
“The Late Christopher B,” and
several minor plays,

Chaco Clash
Is important

Cleven Discusses Problem
at Inquiry Forum

 

“The Chaco-Boreal controversy is
important because it is typical of the
many intricate and diﬁicult interna-
tional boundary problems now facing
the world,” declared 'D'r.'"'And1‘ew N.
Cleven of the history department be-
fore the Inquiry Forum Wednesday.

Dr. Cleven in his talk, dealt with
the dispute now raging between Bo-
livia and Parag_uay.,_ Tracing the, _his-
torical development of the situation,
he showed how the present crisis has
developed.

“The Chaco region,” Dr. Cleven
said, “is a triangular area of almost
100,000 square miles between Bolivia
and Paraguay. It is a. ﬁat, heavily
wooded area, almost uninhabitable be-
cause of the intense summer heat. It
is this climate which has aided in pro-
tracting the struggle; ﬁghting must
cease for at least half the year.”

Following the trouble a.t every step,
the speaker showed that the belliger-
ents have sought the territory for
over a century. The diﬂiculty was in-
tensiﬁed when Bolivia was shut out
from the Paciﬁc by a peace treaty,

“Two recent crises have been
reached in the Chaco,” Dr. Cleven
pointed out. “In 1928, the Pan-Ameri-
can Congress attempted to settle the
matter by arbitration, and in the sum-
mer of 1932, nineteen American repub-
lics, including the United States, tried
to force an amicable solution upon the
warring nations. There" is apparently
no way to settle the problem peace-
ably.”

Professors of Physical and Social
Sciences Comment on Technocracy

 

 

Engineer Hallock Says
Theory Of_fers_,No New
Way Out

By Edwin P. Banks

“It is undoubtedly true,” declared
Professor» John W. V’. Hallock, head
of the department of industrial engi-
neering, “that out of the present de-
pression must come a new science of
management. Nothing which the
Technocrats are offering is of any
value along these lines.” But Dr.
Elmer ‘D. Graper, professor andvhead
of the department-o-f political science,
in reply to a similar inquiry anent the
proposals of Technocracy, made no
such sweeping denunciation.

Hallock Makes Study

Professor Hallock, who has made a
special study of the ideas and pro-
posals advanced by the Technocrats,
stressed the fact that there is nothing
new in it, but the name. To him,
Technocracy seems to consist of two
p'rinciples:_the theory of energy de-
terminants,‘-~ plus certaindire predic-
tions. “It is hardly conceivable,” be-.
lieves the industrial engineering
head, “that following centuries of
work in these ﬁelds by many learned
men, a small group of erratic writers
have suddenly made a discovery of
momentous value to the civilized
world, as this deﬁnition would indi-
cate. If they have thus suddenly

7

made a discovery, why the dire pre-
dictions without the offer of a single
constructive thought?”

Political Scientist Graper
Thinks Theorists Omit

' ~In=-his-'-own spheresof industrial en- ;;

gineering and industrial economics
Professor Hallock ﬁnds many facts in
refutation of arguments of the Tech-
nocrats. “In every period of techno;
logical advancement.” he brought out,
“there has been strenuous opposition
to the introduction of machinery.
Riots and bloodshed have accompa-
nied many improvements that are
now recognized as boo11s to mankind.
As a matter of fact, if technological
advancement has reached a crucial
state, one would expect a constantly
i- creasing G», nu_inber_ of unemployed

uring the periods‘ of mechanization.

Improvements Model

“Statistics prove the exact reverse
has been the case. If we can con-
ceive that all technical improvement
which is possible has been accom-
plished, then we might believe some
of the dire predictions of the Techno-
crats. But it is a known fact that
since 1929, sufficient improvements in
industrial processes have been made
to completely revolutionize industry
when business picks up.”

Concluding, Professor Hallock re-
viewed the chief prophecies of the
Technocrats. “They tell us we are to
be ruled by machinery. They Say
Technocracy will become a system of
living paralleling Democracy, Mon-
archy, Socialism, and Communism.
They say, .‘at best the time is short.

Needed Politics

The day of reckoning is growing near-
er and nearer.’ They remind us of
the perennial prophets who a.re for-
ever predicting the end of the world
——and the world rolls on.”
Offers Nothing New

Dr. Graper, too, believes Technoc-
racy offers nothing new. During the
past few weeks as he has been lectur-
ing to his political science classes, he
has been ‘dropping incisive remarks
about Tecl1nocrac‘y. He has said, “Its
basic conceptions have been advocat-
ed by Socialists and other student of
economics for the last ﬁfty years.
But it is certainly a hopeful thing
that the engineers have ﬁnally dis-
covered ideas which have been long
current among social scientists.”

Dr. Graper further pointed out that
thus far the Technocrats have ignored
the political element in their scheme
almost entirely. “It would seem,” he
declared, “that some adequate, appro-
priate political machinery must be or-
ganized to make an introduction of
the new system possible.” Technoc-
racy, the political science head ex-
plained, is not inherently connected
with any one type of government.
The system would be possible under
comr-uvwisni, socialism or even social

5 democracy.

Eddy Speaks
At Assembly

Noted Author in Memorial
Hall at 12:30 Today

Dr. Sherwood Eddy, noted author
and lecturer, will address a student
assembly at 12:30 o’clock today in the
main auditorium 01’. Memorial Hall.
Dr. Eddy’sl topic will be “The Chal-
llenge of Europe.”

Dr. Eddy will discuss the present

day political and economic problems
which the nations of Europe are fac-
ing and the part which the United
States will have to play in the solu-
tion of these problems, He is one of
the world’s leading authorities on this
topic and has lead groups of profes-
sional men, college professors, and
politicians to Europe every summer
for the past several years to investi-
gate conditions.
_.Although Dr. Eddy is a. personal
frie‘1id".o‘f many of the leading ﬁgures
in numerous countries of the world,
his analyses are clear-cut intellectual
interpretations of the problems as
they actually exist. In two previous
student assemblies here Dr. Eddy
discussed the conditions in India and
the war-threats in China and Man-
churia. Today’s assembly is the third
in as many years which Dr. Eddy has
addressed on the Pitt campus.

Dr. Eddy spoke yesterday at a
luncheon meeting in the Heinz House
-on -“Students . -Faeing~a.—New World.’-’
He appealed for a more active student
participation in political and social
controversies and cited instances in
foreign countries where students were
the most powerful political groups in
the land.

Last night Dr. Eddy addressed a
meeting of YM and YWCA members
in the First United Presbyterian
church. His topic at this time was
“The Way Out—A Personal Problem,”

In addition to the assembly pro-
gram today Dr, Eddy will speak at
the opening meeting of the Interna-
tional Conference on World Problems
which is scheduled for the Foreign
Policy Association rooms of the Ho-
tel Schenley at 8 o'clock tonight.

Dr. Eddy will attack today’s topic
from the ‘viewpoint of immediate solu-
tion of the world’s social a.nd political
ills be a greater knowledge of the
economics which lie behind the pres-
ent depression. The depression
which has been evident in all coun-
tries of the globe is the fundamental
objective of anything which the na-
tions might do to alleviate their citi-
zens from the tax burdens of arma-
ments and reparations.

New Sociology Courses
Offered Next Semester

Two new courses will be offered
next semester by the department of
sociology. Sociology 146 and 176. So-
ciology 146 will deal with “Sociology
in English Literature.” The ﬁeld of
sociology will be examined from the

problems as they are presented in the
non-professional, non-academic liter-
ature. Novels, essays, autobiogra-
phies, travelogues, and short stories
will be the sources of material.

Sociology 176 will cover “Public
Welfare Administration.” Social leg-
islation affecting primarily women and
children will be discussed.

Silverman Boosts Home

Industries In Address

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the department of chemistry, ad-
dressed the Cincinnati section of the
American Chemical Society last Wed-
nesday on “The Signiﬁcance of Glass
in Modern Civilization.”

During the address, Which Was
given in the chemistry lecture hall of
the University of Cincinnati, Dr. Sil-
verman called attention to the fact
that a glass plant, established in 1607,
a mile from Jamestown, was the ﬁrst
industrial enterprise in this country.
Since then the glass industry has de-
veloped until the United States leads
all countries in its production, with
Pittsburgh as the heart of the indus-
try, Dr. Silverman traced the steps
in this development, and said, “The
quality of our glass equals that of
European manufacture and in a num-
ber of instances excels, There is
every reason why the home industry
should be fostered and patronized.”

cision to the Davies poached quintet.

Dukes Favorites

The Dukes enter tonight's fray as
the favorites. Up until Saturday
evening, previous to the Pitt-Temple
game, there was some talk that Pitt
would take the Bluiﬁtes into camp.
But after the game, when the extent
of the injury suffered by George
Cribbs was learned and the announce-
ment that he would be unable to play
for at least two weeks was forthcom-
ing, a dark cloud was seen slowly
coming up over the horizon,

Monday night the Davies coached
cagers turned in a 52-32 victory over
George Washington University for
their alma mater, which added to the
discomfort of the good doctor, A few
hours later he was to learn that
Skippy Hughes would be unable to
participate in tonight's battle of the
week, which made the doctor an im-
mediate believer in Black Fridays.

Opening their season last Tuesday
evening against Westminster, the
Dukes saw their hopes of an unde-
feated season go the way of all ﬂesh
when, at the game's end the score
revealed a 25-23 decision; but not to

, _ , ‘be outdone, immediately appropriated
interpretations of social manners and-

the good doctor's slogan of winning
the rest. Chick Davies immediately
cleaned house and shifted the furni-
ture on his team, putting Captain
Bunk McGeever, center, and Jim Mc-
Dougall, forward, in storage and bring-
ing out Irv Brenner and Paul Birch to
show to the company.
Change Brings Improvement

These two evidently liked the com-
pany for they were the main cogs in
the Duke scoring machine against
Grove City, Friday night, which took
the Grovers over by an overwhelming
score of 52-22, and also defeated
George Washington, Monday night.

Changes Draw Protests of
Conservative Members

Adoption of a resolution permitting
the sale"of‘-'cigarettes"a11d*tobaccos in

set of by-laws for the University Y
branch were the main items of busi-
iiess at a-special meeting of the Com-
mittee of ‘Management of the—YMCA
in the Y hut Monday afternoon, The
by-laws, drawn up by VV. W. Menden-
hall, executive secretary of the or-
ganization, caused considerable con-
troversy for several hours before they
were ﬁnally adopted.

The resolution permitting cigarette
and tobacco sales in the Y building
was taken from the table by a motion
sponsored by a group of the Cabinet,
and was passed in the face of bitter
opposition. Approval of this resolu-
tion by the University»authorities in

‘ “charge of buildings is expected be-

fore the resolution can be placed in

Conservative members of the Com-
mittee overthrew a motion made by
student leaders demanding equal stu-
dent representation on the body.
Nine members of the University fac-
ulty, three. alumni, and nine students
comprise the present cabinet. The
motion called for nine students and
nine faculty and alumni members.
The motion was overthrown after
considerable controversy and parlia-
mentary strategy.

Here Tonight‘

 

Do you know how to crib with the
leading lights of the University? And
do you know how to win over the
members of the opposite sex? The
Pitt Panther which made its appear-
ance on the campus yesterday tells all,
in=addition to jokes, cartoons, and
features which are even more spicy
than ever.

An anonymous cribbing expert, who
knows all and sees all, tells every-
thing in -a .special.feature in the cur-
rent issue of the Panther. By this
great expose, he hopes to brighten the
lives of students who are quakingly
awaiting semester exams. Included
in his article are all the fool-proof
methods which have been thoroughly
tested and found to be more than ade-
quate.

Lois Milliken, Col. ’35 and a psy-
chology major, tells all the results of
her experiment to determine the fac-
tors which are of most interest to the
opposite sex. Fifty .men and» ﬁfty
women ﬁlled in a questionnaire for
this experiment. The results, in brief,

Group dancing is rapidly taking the
place of solo dancing, according to
Miss Adelaide Hunter, well known
local dancer and Pitt Graduate, who

spoke at the WCEL tea in Heinz
House Wednesday afternoon. The
_interest in dancing, she says; is being
transferred from the performer to the
idea of effect to be communicated to
the audience.

Miss ‘Hunter presented a concise
review of the history of the dance
from the earliest times, when savages
gyrated to the beat of tomtoms to the
present day, when dancers are again
using their bodies as an instrument to
express an idea to the audience. The
Greeks made use of chorus dancing
as part of their plays, with the
dancers wearing masks in o_rd_e_r to as-
sume a"number'of parts in tliesame
play and to conceal the small mega-
phones necessary to make their
voices carry in the outdoor tlieaters.

The Romans adopted the -Greek art
of dancing as they did all the rest
of their culture but allowed it to de-
generate until the ‘dance reappeared
in the church choirs as an instrument
-of portraying stories and in the mira-
cle plays.

Every land has developed its folk
dances. These are still danced the
same way today as they were,hun-
dreds of years ago in such countries
as France and ‘Spain. The English
had their singing and game dances,

show that men prefer: ﬁrst, intelli-
gence; second, good looks; and third.
a sense of humor, while the women
prefer: ﬁrst good looks; second, :1
good dancer; and third, conversation-
al ability. Whether or not every one
will agree is still a-subject of dis-
cussion, but these results are taken
from the answers of one hundred peo-
plewho thought they knew. r

Dr. Ralph E. Turner, the popular
representative of the history, depart-
ment who has built up a name for
having the most interesting classes on
the campus, takes his bow in a bio-
graphical sketch. Pitt coeds get a
little more publicity on the fashion
page as they model for Elinor Smith’s
idea as to what the well dressed wom-
an will wear.

“Buy American” is also represented
with some more free advice on how
to round the prosperity corner once
more, and winter sports are discussed.
For January events on the. Pitt cal-‘
endar, the column on Pitt activities
tells the who. what, when, and where.

Adelaide Hunter Outlines
Dance History At WCEL Tea

 

and the South Americans have de-
veloped the tango and the rumba, all
dances with a carefully designed pat-
tern of steps.

Kissing dances were very popular
in the days of Henry VIII, An extract
from a. shocked papa’s journal at the

tiine when coupledanciug was intro-

duced tells us that after watching his
daughter dancing around .in a man’s
arms and showing her ankles when
they rounded ‘corners, he ﬁnally
dragged her from the ﬂoor and car-
ried her home.

There are many modern schools
dancing, emphasizing different styles
of expression, but all are interested
in expressing an idea to the audience
rather than in exliibiting skill or
drawing attention to the dancer as
sometliiiig spectacular. _.

Civicballets are being organized in
many cities for the purpose of furth-
ering the art of dancing and numer-
ous repertoire companies of really
great stars with their followings are
presenting to their subscribers the
best" in modern dancing.

Miss Hunter concluded with a. dem-
onstration of masks which are being
used to more completely eliminate the
individuality of the dancer and further
tlie expression of mood.‘ She present,-
ed a short dance number, wearing the
mask on the back of her head, danc-
ing with her back to the audience, as
one of the many possibilities in the
use of masks.

Squad ln Dual Meets

 

Locals Probable Underdogs in Both Meets on Eastern Trip;
Lett Yesterday Morning, Traveling by Autos, Will Return
Monday Night; Sessa Manages Team

 

Pitt. swimmers led by Coach Pat Corr and Captain Herman Ad-
lersbcrg will race the Yale tea.m tonight at New Haven and tomor-
row night compete against the Harvard nata.tors at Cambridge. The
Yale meet will be the ﬁrst dual meet of the season for the Trees
Pool swimmers; their only competition 11p to date has been in local

A. A. U. meets which they won with uniform regularity.

*4.

It is expected that Pitt will be the underdog in both meets on

the present trip. Yale has been a na-9

tional champion for many years and
reports from New Haven indicate that
the Elis have assembled another
team of Olympic caliber. Harvard
also supports a top-notch team and
will hold a..decidecljidvaiitage over
Pitt in their long tank.
Left Yesterday

Early yesterday morning the squad
left town in automobiles, heading
East. Last night was spent in New
York City; early this morning the
team motored to New Haven. The
team will stay overnight in New
l.Ia.ven. and join-iiey to Cambridge 011

Saturday. Sunday moriiing the squad

will return as far as Philadelphia, re-
main overnight, and return to Pitts-
burgh the following day. .

Since the trip is one of more than
1,200 miles and is to be made entire-
ly by machine, Coach Corr contends
that he will have to put the team
through a number of extra workouts -
in olfder to get the kinks out of tllojr
cirrus and legs. .

World Problems Aired

ORLD problems, economic, political. and social, will hold the at-

tention of almost. a. hundred serious minded university and col-
lege students when tl1e World Problems Conference opens tonight
in the Hotel Schcnley rooms of the Foreign Policy Assoc.ia.tion.

Duringthe t.hree days of the conference, the delegates will hear
subjects of major importance discussed from many angles by more
experienced and older “students”—Drs. Felix Morley, Sherwood
Eddy, Boris Skvirsky and Charles Corbett-—all of whom are expect-
ed‘ to contribute much to the sessions. From the discussions in both
the open meetings and the closed committee sessions, ﬁnally will
come resolutions of policy on each major problem. ‘When adopted,
they will stand as expressions of representative group opinion—-
student opinion—on questions that have our political ant “profes-
sional specialists in luunanity” hopelessly engulfed. '

Thcv resolutions thus adopted deserve to be accepted as the re-'
sults of highly intensiﬁed int.ell.ectual activity, not as the product of
Such demonstrations
of the capabilities of youth indicate that decadence, apparently pre-
valent elsewherc, is far removed from the college campus. '

i This week’s conference, however, does not mark any new and
unheard of trend in student attitude. Similar meetings are taking
place throughout the country, sponsored always, it seems, by student
organizations of worthy standing. That same initiative, noted else-
where, is ‘manifested here in-the:--activity of »- the YM and YWCA.
groups, the two organizations jointly responsible for the current
conference. Whatever the outcome of the sessions, nothing can de-
tract from the credit due these student groups for their initiative
and unbounded energy in promoting an almost tliankless under-

taking.
HE exhibit of modern paintings that is to be shown in Heinz
House next Wednesday under the sponsorship of the department
of ﬁne arts should go far toward awakening student interest in one
of the subjects that is closely allied with cultural development. Al-
though not a student show in the sense of its sponsorship, the exhibit
 one designed to beneﬁt students in all schools. A
Members of the department, keenly interested in promoting a
greater appreciation of the arts, will be present to explain the tech-
niques and trends in modern painting as seen in the thirty-ﬁve re-
iproductions hanging in the exhibit. From the exhibit and the pres-
»cnce of these gentlemen perhaps students with undeveloped interests
fan the arts willbecome better acquainted with this important de-

'~_part.mcn.t., a comparatively new addition to the University, and take

:advantagc of its many facilities.

Pittsburgh, strange as it may sound to business-minded Pitts-
burghers, is known in other sections of the country as an “art. cen-
ter.” This for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact. that
the University of Pittsburgh boasts facilities for the study of line
arts that are equaled by only three other educational institutions in
the United States.

«The department here is not interested in turning out master
sculptors, painters or architects-—-that is being done in such special-
ized institutions as Carnegie Tech. Dr. Clapp and his staff are
chieﬂy concerned with teaching the history of ﬁne arts.

Their work is part of the University ’s program in cultural edu-
cation——of making a liberal arts education mean What is implied in
its name.

IN~AN-an-nouncement-from-London-of plans for a ncw“‘cathedr'al-’
4 like” structure to house the University of London is seen not only
an architectural achievement but also a development in the trend of
modern education toward a closer relationship among students in
diﬁferent pursuits.

Although the university, the largest in Europe, will celebrate
its centenary in 1936, it has never occupied permanent quarters; it
has led, according to its autliorities, “a. makeshift existence.”

The building, according to the dispatch to the New York Times,
by Hayden Church, will have a. long nave-like backbone extending
from a lofty tower and running off at right angles, from which will
extend seven "great wings divided‘ by open‘co°urts.' These will house
-the 40 colleges and schools of advanced study now scattered in dif-
ferent parts of London. The span of the building from the central
tower to the end turret will be about a quarter of a mile in length.
The ten—and-a~half acre site was bought some years ago with 400,000
pounds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation.

Unlike the Cathedral of Learning, little if any steel will be used
in the structure. Charles Holden, Fellow of the Royal Institute of
British'Arch'it'ects, and designer ofthe building, says, “there has
been no test for durability of a steel stone-cased structure for longer
than ﬁfty years.” Since his building is to endure for 500 years, it is
to be constructed entirely of stone.

The same trend in education is noted in the plan described by
Abbott Lawrence Lowell, President of Harvard University, in his
annual report. Upperclassmcn (sophomores, juniors, and seniors)
will live together, cat together, and have common rooms in order
that ideas might be exchanged, deeper friendships developed, and
the scope of education broadencd.——-C. B.

Planning for the Future

 
 
  
 

"huulialall
tballrrg

By Don Early

Seeing Escudero again only con-
ﬁrms the opinion that for pure enjoy-
ment in the dance he remains un-
equalled. In the other dance reper-

their large virtues, one was conscious
of certain shortcomings. There were
times, for instance, when Ted Shawn
appeared ordinary, when Mary Wig-
,.«man showed less grace than a strenu-
ious will to convince us.

But with Escudero and Senoritas
Camela and Carmita the swift lyric-
ism and absolute ﬁnish leaves noth-
ing to be said. Each dance is the ex-
pression of a joyous nature under
perfect control. In all of them we ex-
perience close, human qualities——the
brief subtleties, feminine whims, the
glamor and colorful movement of a
ﬂesta that pulses along the blood.
Escudero does not dance for himself
alone but for a race who have long
spoken eloquently with their bodies,
employing the most graceful re-
sources, down to their talkative ﬁn-
gernails. Nietzche said he wanted a.
god who could dance. Here, we feel,
are ideal humans, animated by beau-
ty, moving through life in e’x'<1uisite
rhythms.

Survey Of Modern Paintings

One of the informative and inter-
esting exhibitions of the year so far
is the group of modern paintings in
the Carnegie Gallery. Though only
framed prints, thesepictures lack lit-
tle of the originals and bring together
works which present a survey of mod-
ern painting that no gallery in the
world can offer. So the exhibition is
really more valuable than seeing a

ew representative originals among a.
clutter of other stuff, as is common-
ly the situation in museums, Here,
all the great moderns communicate.
The confounding Picasso has three
paintings representing three of his
many “periods,” “A Mother and Child
in his pre-war classic mood, an
Absinth_ Dtrinker of the “blue”~ obes-.
sion, as well as an example of his
better known, less interesting, less
comprehensible abstractions. Matisse
is also represented in several stages
of development. The Odalisque is the
one that appeared in the International
two years ago.
Cezanne And Renoir

It is Cezanne and Renoir, however,
who stand out magniﬁcently. VVe
feel that here is sure beauty that is
no vague, -erratic expression of our.
time, Two of Cezanne’s earlier works
show a heavy technique with some of
the power of his maturer painting,
but the great colorist has not yet ap-
peared. A Landscape, Portrait, and
The Bathers are finest, The Land-
scape shows him at his best, vibrant,
and supreme in color; the.'Por.trait is
a profound study of a youth, and The
Bathers, though Cezanne has handled
the subject with greater breadth else-
where, will stand comparison with all
but his finest.

In excellence of color Renoir stands
out also, particular in his Figures in
Landscape, where the ﬂesh tones and
the rich heavy leaves express a. robust
sensuousness. A life study of a girl
twisting‘ her hair has the same qual-
ity with a larger thrust at composi-
tion, while the earlier works exliibit
impressionism at its best. Seeing
these, one feels he ought to turn from
the quibblings of Picasso, Matisse,
cubists, abstractionists or what you
will, to méfi who tried to be artists
above all else, whose work, more sig-
niﬁcantly, is certain in its aim and
consummate in its realization.

Among the others of the exhibition
are three brilliant. Gaugin’s and sev-
eral intense van Gogh’s that fairly
crackle with electric feeling.

The exhibition ought. not be missed,
for it throws a real light 011 modern
painting in -many respects through‘
brin.9;ing some of its ﬁnest accomplish-
ments together. It is, moreover, ma-
terial that will provide an excellent
background for the exhibition of mod-
ern works to be shown at the Heinz
House next week under the sponsor-
ship of the Fine Arts Department.

Students Explain Meaning
Of College In New Record

When the Pittsburgh Record, the
official publication of the University
of Pittsburgh, appears Saturday, it
will contain two articles of special in-
terest to Pitt students. “What Col-
lege Means” will be explained from
the viewpoints of Rose Marie Denies-

tichas, Ed. ’33, and Robert l\l'Iaches-I
ney, Col. '32, former editor of the Pit: .

Vfeekly, now in the oﬂice of William
Morrell, the University editor.

Miss Demestichas defends her pres-
ent course of action in the University.
As a prep-aration for living after grad-
uation, the University is not consid-
ered. To her. campus life is an end
instead of a means to an end and in
the article for the “Record,” she de-
fends this action by enumerating the
beneﬁts she has secured in the last;
four years. College, I--lSS Demesti-
chas writes, means a chance to do a
job well, to secure i'el1owship,. to be
inﬂuential in making University his-
tory, and to secure the discipline
necessary to live congenially with
other students.

Mr. Machesney writes from the
viewpoint of a graduate, Among the

things which he feels that he received
at the University are a keen realiza-
tion of University democracy, tolera-
tion, and pa.triotism.

Pitt’s enthusiasm is exempliﬁed,
according: to Machesney, in its new
Cathedral of Learning. The Cathe-
dral will welcome all students in its

-democracy, give all nationalities a‘
part of the building to decorate and
furnish as they see ﬁt. -With its
breaking away from all former archi-
tectural styles for universities, the
Catliedral typiﬁes the progressiveness
common both to the University and
to the city. The Cathedral represents
the spirit of the industrialized center
which Pitt is meant to serve. Maches—
ney concludes. “The Cathedral, ex-
pressing in steel and stone the char-
acter of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh
students, is symbolic of that forward
march; Pitt keeps pace with the cen-
tury.” -

In addition to the two articles by
these students, the current edition of
the Pittsburgh Record includes arti-
cles by Charles F. Lewis, director of
the Buhl Foundation; Dr. L. P. Sieg,
dean of the ‘College, -the Graduate
School, and acti.-g dean of the School
of Education; Dr. George K. M,cCabe,
assistant professor of economics.

Mr. Lewis, in “Housing Construc-
tion—-A Depression Measure," dis-
cusses the possibility of utilizing mass
housing projects to pull America out
of the business slump. I11 “The Mak-
ing of a School Teacher,” Dean Sleg
defines good teaching, describes good
teachers, and outlines a program for
providing both for our children. Mr.
McCabe utilizes his article to point
out America’s stake in the coming
world economic conference.

“Rid City of Air Pollution,”

 

Says H. B. Meller, Mellon Institute, in Address before

Engineers; “Air Hygiene

Will Pay Big Dividends”

 

‘(A

By Morton Harris I ,
successful cainpaigii for pure air will be one of the popular

liberal movements characterizing the impending period of economic
recovery,” Mr. H. B. Meller, head of the air pollution investigation
of the Mellon Institute, chief of the Bureau of Smoke Regulation,
and former dean of School of Mines, 1915-17, told members of engi-

neering societies yesterday.

He spoke last night to the Cleveland

chapter of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engi-

neers, following earlier talks to the‘:

Scientiﬁc exploration of the bene-l
ﬁcient qualities and effects of sun-l
light are far from complete, he as-
serted, but enough is known to incli-

reasons" to have’ a general--two-hour
mid-day lunch period, much of which
would be spent outdoors in the sun-
shine.

Legislation Needs Reform

The burning of raw bituminous coal
continues to outrank all other sources
in -wgeneratiiig = a.tn1o‘s-plre-Tic‘ impuri-
ties, but cannot effectively be attack-
ed under existing legislation, the
speaker declared. ' He stated that
nearly all city ordinances had been
adopted with the popular expectation
that the commanded decrease in the
visible amount of smokee would be
accompanied by almost complete re-
duction in damage done to health and
property.

The outstanding weakness of the
whole smoke abatement, it was point-
ed out, has been the limitation of or-
dinances to requirements that could
be met by appliances already on the
market. Ordinances have permitted
smoke and dust. because appliances
are not smokeless and dustless; ap-
pliances are not smokeless and dust.-
less because ordinances permit smoke
and dust.

“People want pure air,” Mellcr con-
cluded, “and they have a ‘nallural
right in demanding satisfaction of
this desire. They can gain their ob-
jective if given intelligent leadership,
It is up to the engineering fraternity
to make suitable response. Air
hygiene will pay big dividends in
health and in lowered operating costs
in home, office, store and factory
alike.”

Think of the thrill it will give your Mother and Dad
-—-of the joy it will be to hear their voices each week!

It’s more than a substitute for cut-and-dried letters.

A.telephone«.chat...with. home is next best‘ to being

there.

Get the telephone habit. It's surprisingly inexpen-

sive-—-especially after 8:30 P. M. That is when low
Night Rates go into effect on Station to Station calls.

For 35 cents you can then call as far as 100 miles

away!

To "takeyadvantage of the night-time reduction, be

sure to ‘make a Station -"to Station call. (Justzgive the

home telephone number and do not ask the operator

for any speciﬁc person.) If you like, of course,

charges can be reversed.

Federal tax is included.
