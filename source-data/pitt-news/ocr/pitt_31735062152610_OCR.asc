. Inﬂspeaking of the reporter Mr.
"Jonas" said, that- this factor in‘ news-
paper construction should be familiar
with the mechanism‘ or the,‘ printing
of a paper.‘ It, is. necessary that a?
good reporter shouldknow the various
processes ‘through which his work
passes. Butﬂof - greater importance to
the reporter. is “the nose for news,”
or the_ale'rtness of following up his
“hunch.” -With it a -reporter is bound.
to succeed and without it‘ he is bound
to fail. Supplementing these requisi-
is. the” acquisition of a goo
vocabulary with which to set forth the
items acquired in the ﬁeld. 
Mr.‘ Jonas then explained in detail
and in a fascinating‘ manner the 
tures,,showing thevoﬁices and oﬂic fps;

_ “A,.hug‘e success” was the universal
‘consensus of opinion concerning’ the-
'College~rec,ep'tion held last, Friday
night, in _-Trees, gymnasium. There
were cats in abundance, plenty of
music and ',dancing, and enough fun
and good humor-iabo/unding to: lastthe
‘guests for a .year._ Speeches‘ were
short and to the point, -and the enter-

variety. Although Trees gymnasium
was well" ﬁlled, it was not overcrowded
to such an extentas to hinderthe.

on 1 the pre’s_ence’ of the combined

was tendered a warm welcome by. the

HONESTY THE BEST P-OLICY.

 

The case brought to mention this

week about the student who was_ too
, honest to beat the football authorities

’ ‘out of ﬁfty cents IS an example of
, honesty which is best by test.

We meet hundreds of people who

 l 1 try to convey the impression that they
- ~ are perfect examples of honesty and
 truthfulness, and they are to a cer-
-tain.degree; _
_.cost them anything. They measure

as" long as it doesn’t

everything in dollars and cents and
are content to remain honest as_ long
as temptation does not present itself.

The case of student honesty cited,

. , however, sets an example that every-
“ /one should folow. He had every op-
‘ pqrtunity in the world to keep the
. money but refused.

We should above all else be honest.
Securing school work from another or
copying in examination is one of the
‘worst forms of student dishonesty.

f It is injurious to the student’s moral
‘ welfare and also to his preparation.

Renﬁmber the words of M. M. Cass
when he said, “It is a sad day for a
young man when he first allows him_-

 f _self to believe that there is an easier
, G ~ way of making a dollar than by honest
~ work.”

Some students resort to dishonesty

'; in trying to secure school ofﬁcés for
-, themselves and friends. «Stufling the

ballot box, and voting ineligible men

-are resorted to, and the young poli-

tician gets his crooked start which

, moulds his political policy of the fut-
" ure.
‘ but a young -man, “I hope I shall al-
7'ways possess ﬁrmness and virtue

George Washington said when

enough to maintain what I consider

. the most enviable of all titles, the
'1 character of an honest man.”
, ‘was the policy of his life and he

This

proved that an honest man is the suc-
cessful one. Let us as students learn

. to be honest and sportsmanlike. Give
Kthe other fellow a square deal.
.we win let us win honestly, and if
- we lose let us take our medicine.

If

GOOD WORK, DEBATERS

 

Students interested in debating and
oratory received a thrill when they
saw the large group assembled at the
ﬁrst call of Prof. F. H. Lane. This
promises to be the greatest year yet,

j and every student in the University

who has ever taken- part in debating
or oratory should try out for a posi-
tion on one of the University’s repre-
sentative teams.

No activity offers to the individual

" Power to present a point forcibly,

I 3 to any -man or woman, and the student

"should develop this power through

 ‘ debating. Debating teaches one how
‘ to handle a question, how to gather
and read data. A research is made on
,_:‘the_subject of the debate and a know-
9 ‘ledge gained that will i_iever be gained

in other way. ,
Debating is _a great ‘opportunity
and_out1 -{of ‘ respect‘ to himself and to

down; , _
And think of the Giants and Athletlcs
too—

‘And now there arises from out of the

West,
Two teams that are known to us all,
Who’ve robbed of their brightness two
reat eastern stars,
By pﬁaying the game of football.

But our turn is coming to showlwhat
. we are;

We'll win if we think so and try..
Remember the Braves, Pitt and take
a good s urt; _

Let’s hang a ig crape on their eye.

 

Don’t forget to vote next Tuesday.

ALUMNI COUNCIL. '

 

The adjourned meeting of Alumni
Council originally ‘scheduled for’ Mon-
day, Oct. 19 (the usual meeting date)
was held in room 302. Thaw hall, Mon-
day evening, Oct. 26, at 8 o’clock. A
fair representation of Council was
present, although the attendance was
hardly what is desired. A number of
the members were out of the city and
sent excuses.

Chairman of _Council, Prof. Alex-
ander Silverman, presided. The usual
Committee reports were received and
brought out considerable discussion.
Chairman L. J. Affelder, although
unable to be present, sent a report
for the“Undergraduate Activities com-
mittee,” one of the most active work-
ing bodies of Council. He stated that
a very satisfactory season is antici-
pated for all the student activities.
Old debts are either wiped out or are
being decreased and adjustments
made. He further states that the

ates for support of these activities,
when properly distributed, will again
result in satisfactory ﬁnancial ar-
rangements.

Regarding the new quarterly maga-
zine, “The Panther,” Chairman Affeld-
er reported as follows:

“A number of students have asked
permission to publish a quarterly mag-
azine to be called “The Panther” and
this has received the serious attention
of the Committee. Permission has
been granted these men, who are very
earnest in their efforts, to proceed
with the arangements. We have,
however, imposed the condition that
the sum of $600, secured from annual
subscriptions, which are ﬁfty cents, be
secured before ﬁnal authority will be
given to publish the ﬁrst issue. It is
necessary that this be done so as to
insure the payment of debts which
will be contracted for the publication
of the four issues this Yhar.”

“The Committee asks the support
of the members of the Alumni associ-
ation in this new venture, which seems
to be a very commendable one
indeed.”

A. R. Hamilton reported for the
Committee on Athletics, Chairman
Floyd Rose not being present. Mr.
Hamilton called attention to the very
unusual treatment accorded the Uni-

=,I'S1l‘.y football team on the occasion
of its annual trip to Annapolis, Md.,
early in the season when the U. S.
Naval Academy team was met. Not
only didthey offer us a return date,
Mr. Hamilton stated, but they com-
mended the players for theclean game
and their general deportment while
at 'the_Naval Academy. These wrrds
of praise for the team, coming from
a_ rival of the high athletic ideals of
the U.  Naval Academy, were re-
ceived with applause by Council.
‘Dr. Koch, Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Class Reunions and Organi-
zations, asked’ that some deﬁnite plan
be worked out for these activities
around Commencement time stating
that Alumni were showing much in-
terest in such affairs and it only re-
mained for those in charge of the
Commencement plans to work out a
deﬁnite program. Discussion was en-
tered in by the. Chairman, General
Secretary and other members of
Council and it is believed that better
results will be obtained in future.
The General Secretary reported
that the Alumni Football Smoker held

on "Democracy apd Race Friction; anuat the Fort Pitt hotel Saturday night,

Oct. 17, after the Carlisle Indian game,
had been very successful, a totl of
about 160 alumni attending. .L ny
of these were “old grads” who had
not attended a University social ‘func-
tion for many years. The ﬁnancial
features of the affair were also sat-
isfactory, expenses and receipts be-
ing about even.

The General Secretary presented a
list of 78 names for membership in
the General Alumni association, these
men being secured since Sept. 1. The
names presented, and ﬁnally approved
by Council, are as follows :—Dr.

CLASS REUNIONS.

The important question of class re-
unions at Commencement time was
discussed at length at Alumni Council
meeting Monday night and starting
right now the Committee on Class Re-
unions and Organizations, assisted by
the General Secretary, will work on
plans for these class reunions. Ac-
cording to the schedule of class re-
unions for commencement week, 1910
to 1926, which was oﬂicially adopted
by Council in 1910. the folowing class-
es are to have reunions next’June:’49,
’50, ’51, ’52, ’68, ’O9, ’07, ’87, ’88,
’89, ’90, ’06, ’07, ’08, ’10, ’12 and ’14.

An effort will be made to get a live
worker to stir up interest i neach
class, at least the classes of more re-
cent years, and get as many of the
members together as possible.

The original plan was for each class
to have 2, Life Secretary, who would
keep track of all the members of the
class and work.with the. General Sec-
retary on such occasions. Some of the
classes have elected their Secretaries
and some have not. At.-each class re-
union in future, an effort will be made
to have this plan carried out and a
Life Secretary ghosen.

It is extremely likely that the Com-
mencement program in June will con-
tain more than the usual number of
events of interest to “old grads” and
these will help make -the’ plan for
class reunions more attractive. In
future, the annual W. & J. baseball
game in Pittsburgh will be played
during Commencement wee . A re-
union day for former athletes at the
University is another feature planned
for Commencement time.

If “grads” have any suggestions for
improving these reunions, they will
be gladly received by the General
Secretary.

PENN STATE FOOTBALL. *

burgh Thanksgiving Day with a team

7, has been greater than ever before‘

and the .%raduate Manager has been
almost s‘ amped with orders. An

the wants of alumni as they specify
although this isn’t always possible.
Often two people will ask for the
same seats and it is merely a case

the following day, Nov. 20.‘ The Pitt

At the Monday meeting of the Y.

lined the-ﬁeld of Social Service open

‘Meetings of the Alumni Council are
held quarterly, the ﬁr t Monday in
the months of March, Ila)’, Oct. and
Dec. At these gneetings, questions are
brought up which are of vital import-
ance to the alumni body and the Uin-
versity in gelneral. Council is composed
of ﬁfty alumni and at each all these
meetings we should have an attend-
ance of at least 80 per -cent of the
number. At recent meetings the at-
tendance has not been anything near

. this ﬁgure and Council has been handi-

capped in its work as a result.

The next meeting will be held in
Dec. and the General Secretary will
aim to get every member of Council
out for this if posible. This is two
months hence but it isn’t too early
now to. put down the date in your

book and resolve to attend without

fail. The Alumni Council is the work-
ing committee of the Alumni body and
the men who are chosen to represent
the alumni on this Council are in
duty bound to attend these meetings.

If you are a member of Council and
have been attending, make it a point
to talk to members you meet who
haven’t been attending. If you have
not been attending, decide to come
to the December meeting sure.

in slow GAME

The Varsity out another notch in
their tally of games won when they
defeated Georgetown last ‘Saturday,
21 to o. Pitt.put up an In-and-out
game that at times threatened to cost
them the game,_but they had always
that uncanny ability to follow the ball
which has marked Pitt teams for
years, and this more than anything

 

Two of Pitt’s three touchdowns

-came as the direct result of, recovering

a loose ball——Hasti_r_i_gs picking up a
fumble early in the ﬁrst quarter and
chasing over the goal for a touchdown,
and Miller, in the last period, convert-
ing an intercepted forward pass into
a score by means of a, 40-Yard 1'P?-
The other touchdown was due to Heil s
brilliant run following a dash through
the line, when the diminitive quarter-
back raced through the whole George-
town team for a score. - '

The Blue and ‘Gold played a_ game
that had the critics up in the air, and
that brought about this Week charges
in the local papers that P_itt_ has gone
stale. Whether or not this_ is true, it
is certainly true that Pitt showed
nothing last Saturday that could be
of value to W. and J. scouts who might

be in attendance. The Varsity was

‘ content to plug along, following Hast-

. ings’ touchdown early in the game,

0

and let Georgetown do the work._ In
the whole afternoon Pitt used possibly
half a dozen formations, and all of
these old ones.

Hastings’ run for a touchdown
came following a fumble by Kelly, the
Georgetown halfback, just‘a few’ min-
utes after play, began. Andy 3150
kicked goal, bringing the score up ‘to
seven. Ahter the next kick-off George-
town recovered the ball on Collins’
fumble, but could do nothing to 'P1tt’s
line; nd two attempts at a ﬁeld goal,
both by Weiser, failed-

Pitt took the ball out of danger
when Miller broke down a forward
pass and scooted thirty yards before
being downed by‘We1ser. Following
this Pitt failed to gain, and Hastings
attempt at goal was blacked, George-
town recovering. The visitors then
began a sturdy attack on the Varsity
line, advancing the ball to the 14-yard
line, when the quarter ended. The
ﬁrst play of the’ second quarter, a
forward pass from Weiser,_resulted
in transferring the ball to Pitt. The
rest of the half was uneventful, ex-
cept for a strong advance by Pitt at

' the very close of the period, which

ended with the ball on Georgetown’s

45-yard mark. _

The third period was ‘nearly over
when, with the play in midﬁeld, Carl-
son broke through and blocked Weis-
er’s punt, Morrow recovering out of
bounds. On the ﬁrst lineup Heil broke
through the line and ran 47 yards‘ for
Pitt’s second touchdown, Fry "putting
over a goal. ‘

The ﬁnal quarter was marked by
Hastings’ beautiful try for a ﬁeld
goal from the Georgetown 45-yard
line, the’ attempt failing only by
inches. _ Georgetown brought the ball
out to the 20-yard line and. started
play, making a ﬁrst down in quick
time. On the next play Foley’s pass
went straight into Miller’s hands, and
“Foxy” rambled over the line for a
touchdown, Fry kicking goal. A few
minutes later Noark made a_try for
goal from Pitt’s 30-yard line, but the
kick was low and failed to reach the
goal. The game ended soon after,
with the ball in Pitt’s possession near
the middle of the gridiron.

, The contest was one of the slowest
in history, a contributing factor being
the disposition of the visiting team to
argue with the oﬂicials. At times
there was room for doubt as to
whether’ Georgetown had sent her

«football eleven or her debating team

I Hell, Miller.

to meet Pitt.

The Georgetown bunch was a husky
one, and they were in no way over-
rated in their advance notices. In
Kelly and Murray they have two run-
ning halfbacks who would grace any
lineup, and the whole team seems to
possess plenty of spirit and force.‘

Speaking of reversals of form-—-of

outside of the world’s series—we
bring to your attention the case of
New York University. If memory

with a check to their mad career.-

“Pete” Heil has always stood pretty
high in our estimation; but he never
batted heavier than last Saturday, so
far as advancing the ball was concern-
ed. On his break through the line
and the ensuing dash through the ene-

Captain Emmett, in charge of the

st. earlier than Thursday before the
W. & J . game. Oakland roofs will be
restricted as to capacity, and only citi-
zens of Pittsburgh will be permitted
to occupy points of vantage on Flag-
staff hill. _

There were times in that George-
town game when Pitt’s defense seem-

ed to consist of a center, a fullback,

and a freshman cheering section. But
when that line found that the ball
was within twenty yeards of the Pitt
goal—-‘-well, that was something else
again, as Abe so frequently says to
Mawruss. E
. '—‘0““

Judging from the way he rattles
off a,set of signals, in three series,
Weiser, the Georgetown quarterback,
must have served at one time as an
adding machine. Of co_urse we know
nothing about Washingtonians’ sys-
tem of signals, but we noticed that a
fumble always followed a series that
had “‘33” as the ﬁnal numeral.

__.o_..

At receiving the ball on a kick-off
or a punt, Pitt was distinctly "not
there’ last Saturday. The whole back-
ﬁeld was consistenly poor in this re-
spect, with the notable exception of
Heil, who played one or two pick-ups
off the ground like a baseball short-
stop. - .

Rendall Soppitt gave a good ‘ac-
count of himself in his ﬁrst complete
game of the season. On at least two
occasions the Greensburg boy was the
ﬁrst Pitt representative to reach the
Georgetown quarterback following his
catch of a punt.

._’_.o_..

‘ A few more games like last Sat-
urday’s and we'll think Pitt has three
ends instead of two.‘ Peck and She.-
pira evidently know nothing of the
tradition that a center is expected to
do nothing but pass the pill. They
actually want to" participate in the
tackling. 5

SWIMMING TEAM ’
-COMING STRONG:

Several ‘members of the University
swimming team entered the open gala
given by the Oakland Athletic Club
last Monday evening. They made an
excellent showing and won a place in
every event in which a Pitt man was
entered.‘ Swope won the fancy diving
contest and the relay team easily out-
distanced its opponents in the eight
length open relay. The relay team
consisted of Sweet, Swope and Buck-
land, of last year’s team, and Lud-
wig, a new man from Pittsburgh
Academy. . .

The showing of the team was very
pleasing to the coaches and the. pros-
pects for a winning team are ‘bright.
All men who can swim are urged to
come out for the team, especially any
heavy man who might make a good
plunger, as the University has only
one man for this event. All of last
year’s men are back this year includ-
ing several who holds enviable records
made both here at Pitt and in open
meets. . ’ '

Meets have been arranged with sev-
eral Eastern teams -this winter, in-
clﬁding the annual meet with the
Navy at Annapolis. The team will
also be entered in the meetsyheld at
the «P. A. A. given by the different
Athletic clubs about Pittsburgh.

UNIJEFEATEIJ PITT .,
  PLAYS DICKINSON

After having a week of the light-
est practice of the year the Varsity
will take on the Dickinson aggrega-
tion tomorrow at Forbes ﬁeld. The
work this week has been arranged
with the Dickinson game in view as
a test for next week’s program. It
is expected that this game will give
an oportunity to make ﬁnal rearrange-
ments and plans for the coming con-
test with W. & J.

It is not the intention of Coach
Duff to attempt to run up an over-
whelming score such as W. & J. did
against Dickinson, but rather to hold
all in reserve until the battle of next
week.

Considerable optimism is shown on
account of the victory over George-
town last Saturday, which makes a
list of ﬁve victories and no defeats for
the year. But the Dickinson repre-
sentatives are in no way to be re-
garded as easy victims. Their poor
showing against W. & J. is no criter-
ion of their strength, as word comes
from their camp that the team has
been greatly strengthened and much
improvement has been shown.

_Wilson, Dickinson’s much talked of
full-back and ‘line plunger, together»
with Lauck and Dalton at the halves
is expected to make a strong showing
on offensive work. -

In Wiliamson’s absence .Heil will
probably take the leadership at quart-
er-back. Fry’s good showing in punt-
ing and his masterly defense play last
Saturday have considerably improved
his prospects for a regular berth in
the backﬁeld. Collins will likely start
the game at fullback, with Hastings
and Miller at the halves. The ends
at the start of the contest will be
Carlson and Herron.

Hockensmith will ﬁll _ his regular
place at right tackle and Jones at
left. Smith is sure of his position
at left guard, but there is uncertainity
as to whether Reese or Soppitt will
take the lead on the right side. As
on last Saturday Peck starts at center.

The Dickinson team will arrive this
afternoon, giving them an opportuni-
ty to rest before the game.

FRESHMENLOSE
ma mm TIME

The Freshman team went down ot
defeat before the strong Thiel Col-
lege eleven last Saturday, by the score
of 16 to 13. The game was hard
fought throughout and was marred
by much wrangling on both sides. The
Freshmen‘ early ran up a comfortable
lead and the ﬁrst half ended 131 to 2
in the Pittites favor. Thiel braced up
in the second half and while holding
the Freshmen safe they piled up 14
points. - '

Early in the game Erie Meadows,
Pitt’s quarter back was severely in-
jured and forced to retire from the
game.‘ This seemed to break up the
Freshman’s team work and their
game suffered as a result offumbling.

the ball within the enemies 10-yard
time six different times but on each
occasion failed to score being either
penalized or losing the ball on a
fumble. Capt. Stahlman in the last
few minutes of play ran 50-yards
through the Thiel team and gained
the opponents’ 2-yard line but. agani
they were set back for holding. The
game ended with the ball on Thiel’s
4-yard line. V

Next Saturday the Freshmen jour-
ney to Erie, were they play the high
school champions of Northern Penn-
sylvania. The game promises to be.
a hard one and Coach ‘Aminons is
working the men hard‘ in order to get
thme in conditions for the game.

A PARADE NEXT

I In the midst of all this excitement
over the W. & J. game, why hasn’t

up the subject of a parade before the
game next Saturday? -

‘No, we don’t mean one of those
dinky, minor league affairs that be-
gin at Thaw hall and end in oblivion,
and include the band and one or two
hundred freshmen. Not on your life.
When we say parade in this particu-
lar connection we mean a real, -out-
a_nd-out honest-to-goodness, three-
ringed parade, beginning down town,
continuing through the business sec-'
tion, and on out Fifth ave. to Forbes
ﬁeld. _It ought to include in its mem-
bership a thousand or more gentle-
men with_ leather lungs and castiron
throats; it ought to be led‘ by the
cheerleaders and the band; and it
ought‘ to give the city of Pittsburgh
something worth_look1ng at and list--
ening to‘. in the line of real spirit.
The W. & J. alumni have a parade
every year on the day of the big
game. There’s no earthly reason why
Pitt students and Pitt alumni should
not have one, and a whole lot bigger
one.

HOW ABOUT IT?

unsr YEAR TRACK

 

The annual Freshmen track meet
held. last Saturday morning at Trees
stadium was a huge success. In spite
of the unfavorable _weather and a
heavy track, good time was made in
most _of the events and in one, the
high jump, the University record was
equalled. The record for the high
jump, held by “Jonny” Sheehan, was
equalled by ‘Chapel, formerly of
Youngstown high. The 100-yard dash
brought out several good men and was
won _by Mays in 10 4-5._ Although
handicapped by a sprained wrist,
Sutherland easily won the weight
event and with a little more effect
mlghll “easily. have ‘broken some
records.

The summaries are as follows:
100-Yard dash-— W. Mays, ﬁrst;
Applestein, second; Goehring, third.
Time 10 4-5.

Mile run—-Crete, ﬁrst; Blaustein,
second; Sleek, third. Time 5:25.

_120 high hurdle—Murrey, ﬁrst;

There is a Great
Difference in Tobaccos

Tuxedo is the Mildest, Sweetest, Most
Pleasant Smoke in the World, Because-

Fz‘r.st—No one but the makers of
Tuxedo is willing to spend the
money necessary to buy the mildest,
choicest, most thoroughly aged,

Second-— No one but the makers of
Tuxedo knows how to treat this Bur-
ley tobacco so that every bit of pleas-
antncss and goodness remains in the
tobacco and every bit of unpleasant-
ness and harshness is taken out.
