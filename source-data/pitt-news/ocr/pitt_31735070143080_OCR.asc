Pitt to oppose city’s student tax proposal

Administrators set to lobby against mayor ’s proposed fee that would cost each student $100 a year

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt officials plan to oppose the
city’s efforts to tax students more
than $100 a year. V
University administrators said
in a statement that Pitt will “op-
pose any effort that would directly
or indirectly alter its tax-exempt
status,” though they did not say

’ how they would oppose it.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl pro-
posed in his 2010 budget, intro-
duced last month, to tax students
and hospitals to help the city ful-
ﬁll its funding requirements for

the Act 47 Recovery Plan, which
is meant to help cities that are
struggling ﬁnancially to improve
their credit ratings, among other
things. .

The hospital fee would amount
to roughly one-tenth of 1 percent
of every hospital bill. Each stu-
dent would pay more than $100 a
year for the student fee. If the City
Council passes them, the fees could
go into effect by next fall. I

1 Pitt ofﬁcials met with some city
council members and their staff
Friday to make the University’s
case against the proposed fee. Pitt
spokesman'John Fedele issued a
statement following the meeting

listing its ﬁnancial contributions
to the community, saying, “We do
believe we are paying our fair share
for city operations.”

The University contributes
through Pitt’s police force, the
taxes on its non-educational prop-
erties and its contributions to the
Pittsburgh Public Service Fund,

“a tax-exempt group of nonproﬁt

organizations, including Pitt.
City Councilwoman Theresa
Smith said the city wanted to avoid
charging hospitals and students
more money and is “looking at
these fees as a last option.”
Contributions to the city’s Pub-

lic Service Fund shrank from more .

than 100 to 38 this year, Smith
said. The city claims» that the stu-
dent and hospital fee would help
raise an estimated $15 million the
city needs to increase its pension
fund by $10 million a year under
the recovery plan.

Smith said the council is calling
on Pitt and the other universities
in Pittsburgh to help lobby in Har-
risburg for assistance.

Details on what the fee might
entail, who might be exempt and
how it would be administered still
need to be articulated. One pos-
sible form of the fee would be a
“bed fee” for students in campus
housing, said Smith.

to begin
vaccination

H1N1 supplies received

Julie Percha '

Contributing Editor

Pitt will begin distributing H1N1

V vaccines to students this week.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
the University has received an ini-
tial supply of 1,200 doses of the
H1N1 nasal spray vaccine and that
“small allotments” will continue to
arrive in the coming weeks.

Students can register for the
vaccine at my.pitt.edu or pitt.edu/
swine—ﬂu beginning at 10 a.m. to-
day. Students must sign up online
to receive the vaccine. Fedele said
they will receive a number in the
order of their registration.

The vaccines will be adminis-
tered from noon to 5 p.m. Thurs-
day and Friday in the Petersen
Events Center for students with
registration numbers between 1
and 1,200. Vaccines’ will be free
for students.

Registered students must bring

their Pitt IDs and a printed copy of

their online registration, Fedele
said. .

Fedele said the nasal sprayis
only intended for healthy, non-
pregnant persons between the ages
of 2 and -49.

People who are pregnant or
have a chronic medical condition
— such as heart disease, asthma or
immune deﬁciencies —— are instead
encouraged to wait for the inject-
able form of the vaccine.

I A night out for those against homelessness

Pitt a lead sponsor for local charity’s annual fundraiser where participants sleep outside to raise awareness of the homeless

Kay Oyegun
Senior Staff Writer

About 115 colorful sleeping bags
decorated the portico area outside
of the ﬁrst—ﬂoor lobby of the Pitts-
burgh City—County building Friday
night into Saturday morning.

Shoes, coffee cups and bookbags
lined the ﬂoor, as messy hair and
sleepy-looking faces peaked out
from the top of the sleeping bags.

Most of these people traded in
their warm beds for the cold pave-
ment for the night to participate in
the Sleep—In for the Homeless, apub—
lic awareness fundraising event. ’

Now in its second year, the fund-
raiser beneﬁts more than 1,500 local
homeless children, adults and fami-
lies who seek assistance with the
Oakland-based Community Human
Services, which offers the homeless
programs and housing services. The
sleep-in, an overnight event run-
ning from 6:30 p.m. Friday to 6:30
a.m. Saturday, featured speakers,
songwriters, local politicians and
advocates for homelessness pre-
vention.

“A lot of people forget about the
homeless,” said Alex Wood, a mem-
ber of the nonproﬁt Public Allies and
participant of the event. “When peo-
ple see this, hopefully they will act
and begin to help out.”

More than 100 people paid a $25
fee to participate in the sleep—in.

“Students raised the money or
had itdonated,” said Kelly Willard,
wife of Random Willard, the coordi-
nator of Robert MorrisUniversity’s
Community and Volunteer Services
group. “It was great. There were case
simulations, speakers and an inter-
active quiz. I would do this again.”

The eventwas sponsored by sev— '

eral banks, universities and restau-

  

rants, including PNC Bank, Carlow
University, RMU and Eat’n Park .
However Pitt was the largest ﬁnan-
cial backer for the event, donating
$6,000 to the cause.

“Pitt was our lead sponsor this
year, and we are so grateful,” said
Diane .McMahon, the develop-
ment director for Community Hu-
man Services. “Last year we made
$20,000, and I know we did better
this year.”

At about 9:30 p.m. Friday night,
Community Human Services award-

ed Renny Clark, Pitt’s vice chancellor
for community initiatives and chief
of staff, for his dedication, commit-
ment and leadership in advancing
the Sleep-In for the Homeless pro-
gram.

“I just think it’s important for
the community to understand that
there is a need out there,” Clark said.
“Pitt sponsored the event because
it is focused on community issues
everyone needs to be aware of, and
CHS is one of the support agencies
located in Oaklan .”

Pitt is also partnered with 10-
cal philanthropic agencies, like the.
southwestern chapter of the Ameri-
can Red Cross, Catholic Charities of
the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc., Life’s

Work of Western Pennsylvania and v

the Multiple Sclerosis Service Soci-
ety, to sponsor a United Way Cam-
paign. Lastyear Pitt raised $561,904
for the campaign. I

McMahon said that the funds
raised from the Sleep—In would go
toward hiring nurses to give free
health care to homeless shelters and

support agencies like Jubilee Soup
Kitchen, the Wood Street Commons
community center and the Salvation
Army Family Crisis center.

“People who look at how I live
would consider it unimaginable,”
saidjoe, one of the homeless gentle-
men who participated in the Sleep-
In, but didn’tfeel comfortable giving
his last name. “I don’t have anything,
but I have myself. I have pride and
humility. I think this event was for
good people to learn about some-

‘ thing very real.”

to register for the vaccine, regardless of
whether they intend to receive the nasal or
the injectable forms of the vaccine.

He said students can call the Student
Health Service’s Flu Hotline at 412-624-2222
for more information.

The county also received H1N1 vaccines,
but few people will have access to the initial
shipment.

Dave Zazac, a spokesman for the Allegh-
eny County Health Department, said the

  H1N1 vaccinations in sp

county received 1,000 doses of an H1N1
virus nasal spray and expects to receive more
— including an injectable vaccine — within
the month. .

Zazac said at present, the health depart-
ment plans to give “pediatric candidates,”
people ages 5 to 9 who are in good health,
ﬁrst priority.

He added that members of this age group .

are at a higher risk of contracting the virus
because they attend schools, where illnesses

.

quickly circulate.

Those in other high—risk groups — in-
cluding health care providers, pregnant
women and children with chronic medical
"conditions — will be among the next target

groups, according to the health department’s” 2

H1N1 website.

“We’re being very judicious as to how
we’re going to distribute‘ [the vaccines] to
the general public,” Zazac said.

Unlike the nasal spray, the injectable

who are at least 6 months old.

cine through the Allegheny County Health

Doctors’ offices, on the other hand, might
charge administrative costs for the vaccine,
and the cost could vary per ofﬁce.

“It’s really each individual provider’s

Zazac said the county health department

virus vaccine providers.

supply of immunizations at this time, he en-
courages people to ﬁrst try their immediate

care providers, including doctors and even .

schools, to see if they’re on the state’s list of
approved providers. People might also‘con—
tact the health department at 412-687-2243
to see if their doctor has the nasal spray, he
said. The health department maintains a list
of doctors distributing the vaccine.

Zazac said people should be patient. He
continued, “Don’t be stressed if your pro-

7

vider doesn’t have it immediately.”

In the meantime, Zazac encourages
people who cannot immediately receive an
immunization to practice healthy habits to
prevent spread of the virus.

“There are things that people can do to
help protect against the flu,” he said. These
practices include frequent hand washing,
cleaning household surfaces and covering

' sneezes.

Additionally, he said people should avoid
touching their eyes and mouths, use hand
sanitizer and avoid going to work or school
if they’re sick. .

More health tips are available on the
health department’/s website, www.achd.
net.

Zazac said that eventually, the H1N1 virus
vaccine will be available to all who want
one, even those who are not in high—risk
groups.

“What we’re trying to do, as we do with
the seasonal ﬂu, is to prioritize ﬁrst,” he
said. “There will be enough vaccine once the
shipments are ﬁnalized  [but some people]
might have to wait a little bit.”

cine and its side effects is available at www.

Fighting the Nobel fight: Obama’s prize

 
 
 
 

Mason Herron
Columnist

Vietnamese secret police surrounded
and raided the Roman Catholic Arch-
diocese ofHue on Feb. 19, 2007. Inside
was Father Nguyen Van Ly, who the
police promptly arrested and incarcer-
ated. FatherLywasarrestedforhissup-
port ofBloc 8406, anorganization that
advocates democratic reforms within
Vietnam. Forhis dissidence, Father Ly
was sentencedto eightyears inprison.
He has already served 15 years ofirn—
prisonment for similar crimes.
Despite Nguyen Van Ly’s cour-
age in the face of tyranny, despite his
willingness to sacriﬁce his freedom
and despite his unyielding loyalty to
his principles, the Nobel Peace Prize
committee again overlooked his ef-
forts. This time, his struggles weren’t
overshadowedbyAlGore, astheywere
two years ago, butby President Barack

- Obama.
P Obama was presented the award ,

“for his extraordinary efforts to
strengthen international diplomacy
and cooperation between peoples.”
It appears that the standard for excel-

lence, in the eyes of the Nobel com-

mittee,isno1ongerachievement,buta
politician’s promise. Simple aspiration
has apparently become the necessary

benchmark. In essence, the Nobel

Peace Prize is the global “Certiﬁcate
ofParticipat1'on.”'I‘he Nobel committee
has fallen forthe same illusion as many
Americans——ifObamasay_s something
willbe done, then surely, itwillbe.
The Nobel PeacePrizecommittee’s
decisions haverarelyescapedcriticism.

Yet even when_the award went to its

most controversial recipients—- most
notably Henry Kissinger and Yassir
Arafat— those recipients at least had
some sort of tangible achievement
backing up the recognition. Kissinger
negotiatedthevietnam cease-ﬁre. Ara-
fat, whowas oftenviewedas aterrorist,
at least agreed to the Oslo Accords in
1993.

I’ve come to believe, perhaps fool-

H ishly, that the Peace Prize should be
‘ . attributed to those who have shown ’

some sort of courage and awillingness
to sacriﬁce. This means knowingthat
whatyou riskis monumentally greater
than what you stand to beneﬁt. Carl

ersfallunderthis category. Otl1erwin—
ners exerted time and effortto achieve
the goal of a better world, often at the
cost of their own'well—being.

Here’s what is frustrating about
Obama’s Nobel: The accomplishment
that the Nobel committee has chosen
to admirewas aprimaryreasonhewas
elected president. Americans saw his
willingness to engage the international
communityas refreslringandsyrnbolic
ofhis mantraofchange.His“efforts to
strengthen international diplomacy
and cooperation between peoples”
didn’t require any sort of sacriﬁce or
moral courage. Those efforts got him
elected president.

Might Obama’s policies and ef-
forts to unify the world be success-
ful? Perhaps. But perhaps not. And if
not, what happens? The fact that this

question can be asked shows that the __

award was premature. If there’s such
agrand expectation amongthe Nobel
committee that Obamawill strengthen
international diplomacy, then why not
wait until he has actually done so? If
the committee does not hold such ex-

. pectations, then the award is simply a

hollow gesture.
Criticizingobamaforwinningthe

r award is misguided and incorrect. It

is the Nobel Peace Prize committee

that should receive theﬂak. Some have .

will not seekto promote democracy

outside of the United States. Father .

Ly has intrepidly fought for it and will
continue to do so. I

Commentators might argue that
Obama’s accomplishmentsaredeserv-
ing of the Nobel Peace Prize. But we
must ask: Is he the most deserving?

_Theanswer,atleastthisyear,isanun-

qualiﬁed “no.”

In the wake of an editorial whirl-

that Obama somehow robbed peace-

Some suggest that Obarnahasnot

Of course, this is insensitive.

It does highlight that the Peace
Prizecannot necessarily privilege pro-
active and observable solutions towar.
Similarly, hunger, povertyand injustice
might not be cured with visible or ki-
netic solutions. Heavy-handedness and
the genuine spirit ofpeace rarely coin-
cide. Although peacewithoutworks is
indeed dead, giving orphans a 
reﬁrgees homes and the Third World
food does not ensure we are moving
toward a better, happier world unless
it is accompanied by changes in the
schemawherebyweunderstandthese
issues.

Once we acknowledge that con-
tributions to peace might be equally
worthywhethertheyareobjective and
physical ortheoretical and intelligible,
we must ask ifobamahascontributed
signiﬁcantly in this way. Has Obama
effected any radical shift in the inter-
national ethos?

Undoubtedly, he has.

In his rebranding of the United
States from the uneducated cowboy
oftheworldtothe cool, progressivena-
tiontllafsuyingtogettothevangrrard,
Obamahas donejustas muchforpeace
as any past laureate. When one of the
world’s greatest superpowers is reviled

as a bully and its mascot—cum—leader .

projects anintellectual backsliding, the
international climate cannot possibly
be stable.

Akeystone with cracks in it makes
thewholearchnervous. '

However, Obama shows the global

audience whataface—liftcando to mol-
lify discontents. The hope for which
Obama won the Peace Prize is not the
vague hopethatthe worldcanabe bet-
ter but the very determinate hope that
a world in which the United States is
not a backwater brute is still a coher-
ent world. .

President George W. Bush did not
directly attack peace by going to war.
He did it by convincing the interna-
tional community that the only two
alternatives weretobetrampled under
ared—white-and-blueﬂagorto destroy
the United States. Of course, the latter
was not an option.

The time isnow for

eople across the country cel-

ebrated National Coming

Out Day on Oct. 11, but many
military members could not open the
closet door. The “Don’tAsk, Don’tTell”
policy continues to muzzle soldiers on
the declaration of their sexuality.

On Saturday, President Barack
Obama pledged to scrap that archaic
policy.

He made the promise ataHuman
Rights Campaign dinner. He did not
mince words, and that is encourag-
mg.
The military has discharged more

than 13,500 service members under
the policy since 1994, according to
the Service Members Legal Defense
Network. Here is where we are sup-
posed to say, “In light of two wars,
the military needs all the help it can
get,” citing the many discharged gay
soldiers who speak Arabic. But the
military should allow gay people to
serve openly whether the United
States endures war or enjoys peace.
No matter the circumstances,
losing 13,500 trained soldiers is a
tremendous detriment to the armed
forces. Continued discrimination,

‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ reform

though, is an even worse detriment
to this nation’s moral character. It is
hypocritical to suggest that gay mili-
tary members are useful during con-
flicts, but disposable otherwise.
Atthe dinner, Obama seemed com-
mitted to endingthe state—sponsored

» discrimination. He said, “My expec-

tation is that when you look back on
these years, you will see a time when
we putastop to discrimination against
gays and lesbians, whether in the of-
ﬁce or on the battleﬁel ,” according
to Reuters.

Noticeably absent was any men-

tion of the chapel.

Obama acknowledged the gay
community’s frustration over slow
progress. Especially on Internet blogs, .
he has faced growing criticism for a
seeming ambivalence about gay

Ananonymous Obama adviser at-
tackedthese critics, accordingto Slate.
com. “Bloggers need to take off the
pajamas, get dressed and realize that
govemingaclosely divided country is
complicated and difﬁcult,” he said.

We thought Obama was capable
of handling more than one issue at a

time. Health care feuds and awheez-

' ing economy have stalled movement

on otherissues,butending“Don’tAsk,
Don’t Tell” will never get less difficult
than right now — this year.
Whether Democrats lose seats
or stay even in the 2010 elections,

V they surely will not gain any more. If

Obama waits too long, continuing to
make pledges instead offorcing action
as commander-in-chief, he will be in
the same position as former Presi-
dent Bill Clinton: forced to swallow
some tepid “compromise” in place
of equality.

The next time you head out to a

might be the key to letting the show
go on.

“Social consciousness is abig part

“We’re musicians, but we’ve managed

to put together this thing. You come
to a show by bike and right off the bat

Mr..Something Something tries

vironmental activism doesn’t end once

- attendees reach the concert.

SoundCycle is a system that allows
concert—goers to clip their bicycles into

“This lets us go anywhere and put

“In practical terms, we’re saving

he said. “People will show up and ask

l‘Where the Wild Things Are’ not average family flick

Broken down into four components, Andy proves that “Where the Wild Things Are ”' exceeds other family movies

Andy Tybout
Staff Writer

Don’t be fooled. -“Where the Wild

Things Are” is not your typical fam-
<r wily movie. ‘

Usually when people hear the
phrase “family movie,” they think,
“Hey, take your kids to this movie,
and maybe they won’t bug you for
90 minutes.” And rightly so. Many
of today’s children’s ﬁlms, with the
notable exception of Pixar’s ani-

. » mated ﬁlms, are simply hyperactive

romps featuring vaguely archetypal
talking animals.

But I assure you, there is a qual-
ity difference between the talking

‘ "monsters of “WTWTA” and the
talking Chihuahuas of “Beverly .

Hills Chihuahua.” To prove it, I’ve
come up with a list of four of the
ﬁlm’s collaborators who illustrate
the ﬁlm’s elevation beyond bland
kiddie fare.

1.) Legendary writer-illustra-
tor Maurice Sendak: Since most
of you grew up after 1963, I don’t
think Sendak’s magnum opus of
children’s books, “Where the Wild

Things Are,” needs much introduc-
tion. We all grew up reading about
main character Max’s escapades,
and we all envied his ability to ven-
ture freely from his room to his own
private wild kingdom.

But what you may not know is A

that Sendak has problems with de-
pression, that most of his relatives
died in the Holocaust or that he
once declared that he hated peo-
ple. It’s all the more impressive that
Sendak has somehow managed to
ﬁnd a redeeming strain of humanity
—-— namely, our childlike innocence
and wonder — and derived mean-
ingful art from it.

2.) Ultra-hipster director Spike
Jonzez Whether “WTWT ” soars
or bombs, director Spike Jonze is
certiﬁably awesome. Before his two
previous adult-intendedfeatures,
“Being John Malkovich” (1999)
and “Adaptation” (2002),_]onze di-
rected music videos for such greats

as R.E.M., Weezer and the Beastie -

Boys. Look up the hilariously low-
budget “Sabotage” and you’ll get a
taste for his style.

And ﬁttingly, Jonze has an
overactive imagination. His ﬁrst

ﬁill-length ﬁlm, “Being John Mal-
kovich,” was, more literally than
you’d think, about beingjohn Mal-
kovich. The protagonist (John Cu-
sack) controls the respected actor
through a portal in his ofﬁce.

The ﬁlm was a critical and com- ‘

mer,cial success + earning three

ented and versatile writers of his
generation. ‘

Before delving headﬁrst into
the land of the wild things, Eggers

‘ wrote a groundbreaking memoir

(“A Heartbreaking Work of Stag-
gering Genius”) about raising his
brother, Toph, after their parents

nothing else, churn out something
original, if not wholly masterful. But

 Take consolation in the fact that it’s a distraction we can all
partake in. And that’s what family movies are all about. V

Oscar nominations and twice its
budget — but that didn’t stop
Jonze from risking his reputation
as a highbrow artist to produce the
decidedly less classy but no less en-
tertaining “jackass” and “Jackass
Number Two” ﬁlms. Say what you
want about Jonze, but the man is
brave.

What he’l1 bring to the movie, I
suspect, is tight dialogue and com-

Band accessible, danceable but not categorical  

Mr. Something Something 4 9

' SoundCycle. The system is the first of its kind,

but MacLean is enthusiastic about the prospect
of other bands soon following suit.
“For a while we were ahead of the curve, but
a lot of people are on the bandwagon for pedal
power. At ﬁrst I thought, ‘We aren’t that special,
there will be a lot of people doing similar things
soon, so we betterpush itnow.’ But now myfeeling
is regardless of whether other people are doing
it or not, its still a really good show — a great
environmentis created by it, and it doesn’t matter
if you were the ﬁrst to do it or not.”
MacLean started the band with childhood
friend and percussionist Larry Graves.
“We started playing music together by age
12. Later, the two of us moved to Toronto from
"Ottawa and found the rest of the band,” he ex-
plained. '
2 One ofthese band members andahuge leader

in the activism goals of the group is frontman ,

Johan Hultqvist. Passionate about environmental
activismand social justice issues, Hultqvist helped
propel the band toward what itcalls “dance ﬂoor
activism.” 2

“All of our music is highly danceable — you
have these grooves that aren’t going to stop.
Sometimes our songswill go forlo or15 minutes
or longer. As everyone’s dancingtogether, there’s
that sense of people coming together to move,

andas ithappens you are changedbythe experi— ‘

 
  
  

ence,” MacLean said. “After a few minutes, this
trance state happens and people start to receive
social messages.”

It’s this projection of messages and ideas that

motivates the group to keep Soundcycle going. -

“We want to get something across to people that
is real and current. Maybe it’s not like going to
church and gettingbeat overthe head, but itgets
you to think and allows you to make some self-
improvement,” he said.

The group has witnessed ﬁrst—hand the ef-
fect its music can have. MacLean told a story of.

a terminally ill man who came to a show.
“Hewas seated onastoolforthe ﬁrstﬁve min-
utes, and then he leapt up and started dancing.
He took a bad fall but got back up. He ended up
dancinginaway he neverhad before. He found an
avenueinour shows and allowed himself, despite
everything, to open up and be ecstatic,“ he said.
V Mr. Something Somethingis clearly in aﬁeld
of its own. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact genre,
both for_ listeners and the band itself.
“We wrestle with names because there are
a lot of categories we don’t belong in. World,

r

what is world music‘? Are we jazz? No. There’s 
a Swedish front band — so that word ‘afrobeat’
starts to peter off because we’re not Nigerians,”
MacLean said. _

So how would MacLean describe the group?

“I would say we’re accessible. I think the fact
that the music is danceable, it’s a universal thing“,
—— all of a sudden language isn’t that important.
Most of the music I listen to isn’t even in English,
so I can’t understand it, but sometimes it’s nice to
not havethe lyric imagery. Worldwide, people can
feel a pulse and a dance beat, it doesn’t matter.”

defeat to the Georgetown Hoyas last weekend. _

“Running backs rally team to victory

Freshmen running backs Dion Lewis and Ray Graham prove their worth on the field '

Greg Trietley

V“ Staﬁ Writer

Traditionally, when a team is down

by double—digits, it abandons the _

run.

Against the top rush defense in
the Big East, Pitt took the opposite
approach. With a 15-point deﬁcit
and an ineffective passing game,
the Panthers called on freshmen
running backs Dion Lewis and Ray
Graham to jumpstart the team.

"" And the duo did just that -—

rallying Pitt to a last—second 24-21
victory.

“We hadn’t been running the .

ball in the ﬁrst half,” Pitt coach
Dave Wannstedt said. “[Running
the football in the second half]
gave us life.”

The biggest offensive question
mark entering the season, Pitt’s
running game, is now the go—to

option for offensive coordinator _

Frank Cignetti.

“What we want to do this half is
to get back to the running game,”
Graham recalled Cignetti as say-
ing. “And that’s what we do, be-
cause that’s what we normally
do.”

In the last two weeks, Graham
' has seen his playing time increase

and is now a potent complement
to Dion Lewis.

“As the weeks go on, Ijust feel
mo re comfortable with the plays,”

_ ‘he said. “I don’t think about it as

much as I used to. I just go out
there and just play.” '

The increased comfort level
has shown. Graham has averaged
more than 6 yards per carry in the
last two weeks.

" 1 Meanwhile, Lewis continues

to post impressive stats. He now
stands third in the nation in rush-
ing yards with 738 and remains
tied for the lead in the Big East
with seven rushing touchdowns

“despite a touchdown-less game

against the Huskies.

But the Connecticut game sig-
naled a shift for Lewis. Before
Saturday, the young running back
had struggled in the second half,
accumulating most of his yards
early in the game. But against Con-
necticut, he ran for 136 yards after
halftime. .

Wannstedt expressed his ad-

miration for both backs.
“[Lewis] is tough and strong,
and you better tackle him,” he said.
“And [Graham] is learning on the
move. I didn’t think [he] would be
this far along either, so I’m pleased

, with both those kids.”

Although he’s found success in
his ﬁrst year, Lewis deﬂected the
praise to his offensive line.

“The line does a great job ev-
ery game,” he said. “Today they

’ stepped forward. I just keep trust-

ing the blocks and just keep run-
ning hard.” .

Graham had similar praise for
his blockers. V

“They work hard every time,”
he said. “They trust the running
backs. They know that once they
get in that hole, we’ll see the hole.
We’ll make it happen.”

The success of the running
game opened up the passing game
against Connecticut. The Huskies

bit on a play-action fake on Stull’s

26-yard touchdown pass to Jona-_
than Baldwin late in the third .

quarter. -
“Once we started running the

ball, [Connecticut] started playing .

up,” Graham said. “And that’s what
opened up the pass.”

Lewis and Graham still have
room to improve as freshmen,
however, and Lewis recalled his
drop on a would-be touchdown
reception. -

“Knowing that I missed that
play,” Lewis said, “I gotta make
more big plays to make up for what
I did.-” ’

His runs of 21, 33 and 32 yards
in the second half atoned for the
error.

With those results, Pitt will
continue to feature both running
backs on offense. Graham believes

- that he and Lewis are building a

rapport. ,

“We trust one another,’_’»Graham
said. “If I’m out on the ﬁeld, he
goes out there and he encourages

* me. If he’s on the ﬁeld, I encourage
him. We look for each other to get

that extra boost.”

But it’s not just the coaches who
noticed the strong play bythe pair
of running backs. Baldwin antici-
pates great things from Lewis and
Graham.‘ ‘ .

“You got two great running
backs, both freshmen,” Baldwin
said. “They’re going to be here for
three ‘more years.”

Tight end Dorin Dickerson, who

. had a 27-yard touchdown recep-

tion against the Huskies, also com-
mended the youngbackﬁeld.

“It_is amazing to watch those
guys to come in and do that,” Dick-
erson said.l“What are they going
to be like three years from now?
It’s going to be exciting around
here.”

A.  by 15 in the second half,
the Pittsburgh Panthers scored 18

"unanswered points to win their
conference home opener against
Connecticut. _

The ﬁnal three points came
from junior place kicker and punt-
er DanHutchins as time expired to
give Pitt (5-1 overall, 2-0 Big East)
a 24-21 victory. The ﬁeld goal was
Hutchins’ third of the game and
accounted for nine of his 10 points
in the game.

He was 3 for 3 in ﬁeld goal at-
tempts and connected on his only
extra point attempt.

For his performance against
Connecticut, Hutchins was named
the Big East special teams player
of the week. . 4

Head coach Dave Wannstedt
said that Hutchins’ performance
wasn’t expected, but he’s glad to
see the new kicker perform under
pressure. , ,

“Hutch got a chance to kick
the winning ﬁeld goal at the end.
Sometimes that is taken for grant-
ed. We-have a new snapper, holder
and kicker,” Wannstedt said after
the game. “As a coach, you don’t

V -take those things for granted.”

Along with nailing ﬁeld goals of
42, 19 and 18 yards, Hutchins also
averaged 43'punting yards on three
attempts. Two of his punts pinned
the Huskies inside their own 20-
yard line, including one that was
downed inside the 10.

Hutchins’ 42-yard ﬁeld goaland
10 points were career highs.

For the year, he is 7 for 7 in
ﬁeld goal attempts and is the
Panthers’ seco‘nd—leading scorer
with 45 points. Hutchins is aver-
aging 41.5 yards per punt and has
downed 11 inside the opponents’
20-yard line. _ A V

The Panthers will play at Rut-

. gers (4-1, 0-1) on Friday before re-

turning home for three-straight

games. Kickoff for the Scarlet

Knights game is set for 8 p.m.

In evaluating the two road victories for the Pitt
women’s volleyball team, head coach Toby Rens
praised the entire team for their efforts against
Georgetown and South Florida.

“We really had a great balance, both offen-

Y. sively and defensively,” he said. “I was pleased

with our team play as a whole over the week-
end.”

Pitt (13-7 overall, 5-1 Big East) secured its sev-
enth shutout of the season against Georgetown

(11-10, 1-4) on Friday, setting the tone early in
the ﬁrst set with a 25-9 win.

“The aggressive start to the match really
helped us continue with a high level of play
throughout the following sets,” Rens said.

The Panthers took the next two sets byway
of 25-12 and 25-18 scores. Senior Meagan Dooley
led the Panthers with 11 kills and eight blocks.

“Dooley is able to be such an offensive
weapon because of the excellent play around
her,” Rens said. “The passing of Michelle Rossi
and the hitting and blocking of [Melissa] Sta-
delman and [Imani] Harper enable Dooley to
do her job.”

W Volleyball earns seventh shut—out of season

On Sunday, Pitt faced an even tougher chal-
lengeinTampaagair1st South Florida (10-5, 3-2).
Rens said the crowd was a major factor and the
environment was hostile.

But despite the enthusiastic home crowd and
losing the ﬁrst set,_the Panthers fought back to
take the second and third sets and ﬁnished the
match with a ﬁﬁzh-set victory, 15-9.

Defensive improvements and blocking
adjustments proved to be the answer for Pitt ,
in the later sets. They succeeded in shutting
down the Bulls’ star player, Marcela Gurgel,
whowas named the Big East Pre-Season Player
of the Year. - <

Harper, a junior, led the Pitt team with 13
blocks in its win at South Florida.

“Double-digit blocking numbers do not oc-
cur often, and Harper’s play, combined with
the nine blocks of Stadelman, really made the
difference,” Rens said.

The effective team play carried over from the
Georgetown match, as four Pitt players — Dool-
ey, Harper, Stadelman and Amy Town — put up
double-digit kills against South Florida.

The Pittwomen’s volleyball team will 1ook.to
extend its winning streak to four matches when
it takes on conference leader Notre Dame in a
home match on Saturday. ’
