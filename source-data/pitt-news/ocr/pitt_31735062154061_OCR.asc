IN- : REGARD To THE .
SWIMMING’ POOL

._/

In the last issue of the" PITT 

V‘/EEKLY a letter was published

‘relative to the use of the swiminijng,

pool." Since that time the WEEKLY
has obtained some important "facts
’regarding the use of the pool which

A-were hitherto_ unknown to the author -S
of the letter and many other students - '

interested. . . . .

In this regard, the rulesfor the
use of.-the building areas tollowszi
Gymnasium work, “24 hours as week

for class woCrl:.for men, and 6 hours A

for women students.” This leaves
about 10 hours a wéek, between the
hours of 8:30 to'5:30.' The basketbaloli
squad uses some of this time and
leaves but few vacant periods. 1 Gym’
work is required for all the first and
second year students, and they all
have opportunity to use this part of

are scheduled for Monday and Wed-

nesday, p. m., ailld women Friday, ,p._

m. The swimmers may use the pool
at all ‘times between 8:30 and.5":30, ex-
cept at assembly periods. On Satur-
days the rpoolis emptie’d,a-‘nd thor-
oughly scrubbed. A T
Requests for use of the pool which
have been refused, have come from

..students who are ‘cutting assembly

and some who insistupon using the
pool ‘when classes forvnon-swimmers
are being held.  '

By absolute separationof swimmers
and non-swimmers, probably 100 boys
who could not swim a stroke have
been taught to swim t_he,vvid‘Cth of the
pool/by Mr. Taylafpr this‘ term. The

.m.en whoagswimg sho-u»ld...bCear in‘ mind.

that ‘they have the; use of the pool
every Tuesday and Tliursdayw after-
noon and any time in the morningex-=_

. ce’pt 8:30 and 9:30 on Tuesday, 11:30

an"dCl2:30 on Thursday and pn Satur-
days. C

These privileges of. - course apply
only toﬂthe students who have paid

2

‘the physical education fee. ‘It is fur-

ther emphasized that any studenbwho
wants to learn to SVVll’l’1 or who wishes‘
‘to swirn for exercise’ or pleasure or

-. wishes to use’ the gyinnasium*and

who thinks these privileges have been
denied him should ‘make complaint -to
Mr Miller. . ’ T , .
The students should bear invmind
_that.Cthe gymnasium must take care of
all regular and, sp¢Ccial5_cl_ass~work,

[varsity and .-fr'esilim<an~Cbas_.ket ball,
