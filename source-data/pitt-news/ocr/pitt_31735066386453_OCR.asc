Miami passing attack may be just a

Communication, student involvement
and public safety were the top priorities
voiced by Student Government Board
candidates at last night’s “Meet the
Candidates.”

-"As a representative I will represent

"each group separately but equally. I will
listen to your concerns and take actions
accordingly,” Njugi Nginyo said. “I believe
it would be wonderful if there were
workshops similar to the writing
workshops for all academic disciplines.”

Being accessible to the student body,
having mandatory exams for graduate
teaching assistants, improving student/
faculty relationships, placing an SGB
suggestion box in the union and lobby to

"U" make SGB more accessible to the
students, and seeing the Student Health
Services expanded are also among the
things he plans to accomplish if elected.

Nginyo said that relocating SHS is
feasible.

“The problem is location. We know
there are tunnels underneath the Towers,
and that would be the most central place
A for it,” Nginyo said.

' 0 "My first concern is to represent all of
those militarily oriented Pitt students.
These people are politically active and
involved students.  My second concern
are those students who aren't members
of fraternities or sororities. It comes
down to a matter of proportion. Non-

Greeks need someone to represent them,”
Jeffrey Custer said.

Custer also said although he supported
the military ruling that prohibits gays
from being involved in the military, he is
sensitive to their rights to an education.

0 ”I’d like to see choice dollars pushed
more. I believe it is a waste of money if
a person is paying for 14 or 19 meals a
week and not getting a refund,” Thomas
Landon said. Transportation access to
North Oakland and Carlow College and
improvement of computer labs are his
other concerns.

-Andrew Gould plans to improve
communication between students and
administration and create an active
committee to deal with communication
between students and the administration.

“Communication is the key element in
trying to combat the main problems
facing our university, such as public
safety, residence-hall expansion, apathy
and racism.  Everything is important to
me," Gould said.

-"I am interested in developing a
more intense campus-safety program
which would involve extending the
campus-shuttle route as well as extending

‘the hours,” Kristen Wesolowski said.

Wesolowski also will work on: a
pamphlet about crime in Oakland to
make students aware and more alert,
new dorms, an extended choice dollars
system, a more united campus, support
for minorities, sponsoring minority events
and creating a strong board that won't

,Board hopefuls explain plaI_ff'orms%to student body

take no for an answer.

Openness, diversity and understanding
are her goals along with accomplishing
the projects that the old board started
and couldn’t finish.

0 ”[I’ml concerned about the betterment
of life on campus. This concern is brought
about by factors that affect our safety, not
just as students but as citizens of the
community; racial and ethnic relations
and the lack of interaction between
teachers and students,” Brock Hamula
said.

Finishing projects started by the current
board, extending shuttle service to North
Oakland and the Victoria Building,
creating a crime watch, publishing and
distributing a student guide to off-campus
housing, offering protection seminars,
enforcing mandatory teacher evaluations,
having a more liberal visitation policy for
residence halls, bettering racial and ethnic
relations and working with organizations
are his goals for the term if elected.

-"I found, after taking a computer
science class, that the [computer] labs are
very frustrating to the students. I would
like to extend the hours to make the
computer labs more accessible to the
students. I would also like to see a
booklet published in layman’s terms so
more students could understand how to
use ltheml,” Craig Williams said.

Campus safety, extending choice
dollars, creating a vegetarian menu for
the cafeterias and being available are
also among his ideas for the year.

o”Progress can only be achieved by
honesty and openness,” M. Chad Wertz
said.

His goals for the term involve promoting
student involvement and unity, increasing
public safety, maintaining committees
and creating new ones to achieve goals,
sponsoring more student activities fairs
or promotional fairs, extending the shuttle
service, publishing a pamphlet describing
shuttle routes and hours, and encouraging
a crime watch.

o”I would like to continue with the
safety program initiated by this year's
president. I would like to see the South
Oakland shuttle extended to include the
areas by Lothrop Hall and the Victoria
Building and make the students aware of
the existing safety programs," Erin
Rodgers said.

Opening the SHS on weekends or
getting a university-affiliated hospital to
serve students and have the cost covered
by the health fee, finding more space for
the SHS and justly representing all student
groups are her goals.

°Creating an advisory system for
students choosing classes, safety and
accountability of the board are Gil
Golden’s platform for the term. “We
have the responsibility of being
sympathetic to the interests of the
undergraduate students at the university, ”
Golden said. Improving computer labs,
creating a ﬁnancial-aid committee and
having a strong representative student
council are also among his objectives.

Candidates name safety, communication top goals

(Editor’s note: Ybe following are excerpts from essays
submitted to The Pitt News by the Student Government
Board candidates.)
Jeffry Custer, Soph /Englisb Writing My major goal is to
remove the archetype of “warmonger" often placed upon
ROTC cadets, Reservists, National Guardsmen and prior
military service people. I desire to change the view many
take of the Armed Forces and place military personnel in
a kinder, more objective light.
0 O 0

Brock Hamulajr ./ Political Science/ Economics: Throu gh
my work with the senate committee on student affairs,

several student concerns have come to my attention. We
are currently working with minority retention issues
which I find very important and necessary at the university.
I hope to be able to help minority students and bring
them into the main flow of activities that the University
of Pittsburgh offers. A few other issues that I wish to
address will be increased safety for nursing students at
the Victoria Building, the expansion of Choice Dollars
and MAC machines into the South Oakland area and to
continue the work of last year's Student Government
Board.

Gil Golden, Sopb/Behavioral Neuroscience: The top
priorities for SGB are to accurately represent student
interests and to be accountable for their actions. It is
currently easy to accomplish goals on SGB without
representing students’ interests. Members and the president
need to be better accountable to ensure fair representation.

communications between the university administration
and its constituents, as well as attempting to better

The reason I am ninning is
because I want to see
representation for my class. I
want improvements on
transportation, like running the
Pitt shuttle bus to North Oakland.
Plus I would like to inform people

I would like a board of all the

Njugi Nginyo, ]r./Busz'ness/

has become detached from us.
Codes have been enacted, and
the organization is running
efficiently, but the students have
lost touch with their governing

to live and learn

  

  
 

Chad Wertz, ]r./Commun-
ications/Business: I am running
for SGB because I am concerned
with many aspects on campus
that SGB could help improve.

SGB needs to take initiative in
many issues including curbing

student apathy and improving
public safety. Apathy is a

dangerous thing to have on a

campus and although it will never
disappear completely, it can be

curbed. To do this, SGB needs to
encourage us all to work toward

more involvementso as to protect
our student interests.

Kristen Wesolowski, jr./

campaign is centered around a

more united campus. I feel there

is a strong need to lessen tensions

created by racism, sexism and

creating new dorms, improving

the lottery system and relieving

Craig Williams, Sopb/Political

’ Three qualiﬁed for SGB...

The Student Government Board consists of eight
members plus a president. For this year’s election, 10
people are vying for those eight spots. During voting,
students will able to choose five people for the SGB.

Gil Golden has served with the SGB for a year, spending
time on the allocations committee, and seems to know

._ many of the processes through which the board works. -

Golden also has definite plans for the board. One of his

! major goals will be to provide students with a course/

professor evaluation guide so that students will be able to
decide for themselves what classes and professors will
best suit their needs.

With these distinctions, Golden is easily one of the most
qualified candidates running for the board this year.

Kristen Wesolowski is another candidate with enough
experience to make a difference on the SGB. She has
served on the elections, committee, a University Senate
committee and the governmental relations committee.
These past services give Wesolowski a major advantage
'over other candidates. .

Wesolowski correctly believes that she cannot turn the
university around with major changes immediately. She
also realizes that many of the changes, at first, will have
to be minor.

But Wesolowski also wants to keep previous board

ideas going, like installing a book exchange for students
and expanding the choice dollars program.

Though 'Weso1owski works for the advertising‘

department of The Pitt News, this is not the reason we
endorse her election; rather, her work with SGB shows
her to be a competent, qualifiedcandidate for the Board.

Andrew_Gould has worked with the SGB as resident
student assistant and knows student concerns. This
experience can be an invaluable asset to a prospective
board member.

As a member of the SGB, Gould plans to address the
communication problem between the students and the
adrninstration, and also between the SGB and the student
population. ‘

Gould is also a very articulate public speaker, an
important quality of an SGB member. Because of these
reasons, The Pitt News also endorses Gould. ,

Members of the SGB need to be in touch with the entire
university. It is a tough, demanding job. Of the 10
candidates running in the election, we believe that only
Golden, Wesolowski and Gould have the qualities and
the capabilities to handle the job efficiently.

Many complaints have been lodged against students in
the past for being apathetic in campus activities. Students
should make an attempt to vote in the election to show
that the university wants a change.

 

Equal rights. Women have been fighting for it for
hundreds of years, and once they ﬁnally get
somewhere, discrimination always seems to prevail.

A few weeks ago, Boston Herald sports reporter
Lisa Olson went to interview the New England
Patriots in the team’s locker room after a practice‘.
Olson, however, did not get an interview. What she
got was much, much worse.

Olson claims that she was “mind raped” by at
least ﬁve of the team members. Patriot tight end

them, male or female. Do these players make rude 

gestures or “wiggle their waggles” (that’s how Kiam
put it) in front of the men who come to interview
them? I don’t think so.

It is tradition for sports heroes to be respected by
millions of children (and adults, too). It’s about time
these players realized how much of an effect they

have on children’s decisions about

Since Olson’s accusations,

Sexual harassment is nothing
new to females, especially female »
sportswriters whose daily schedules consists of

 locker-room interviews. This time, the Patriots took

their harassment a step too far.

Patriots owner Victor Kiam II, who also owns
Remington (as in shavers, etc.) reportedly said, “ I
can’t disagree with the players’ actions.” He also
stated that the Herald was asking for trouble by
assigning a female reporter to his team, adding that
Olson is “a classic bitch."

Am I the only one who thinks this man is a
chauvinistic pig? Apparently not. Boston’s chapter
of _the-- National Organization for Women urged a
boycott of Remington products, thereby forcing
Kiam to spend $100,000 on full-page newspaper
ads in the Herald, recanting his statements. Olson
later accepted his apology, but nothing was said
about the players’ apologizing to Olson.

Most of you reading this column, too, will say that
she asked for it. But how can you, or Kiam for that

charges have been brought up
against Cincinnati Bengals’ Coach
Sam Wyche. Wyche reportedly did not let any
reporters (male or female) into the Bengals’ locker
room within 15 minutes after the team’s loss to
Seattle because he feared there might be a repeat
performance of the Patriots’ case in his locker room.
Apparently Wyche does not have too much faith in
his team.

With all occupations come certain unwritten
guidelines. Female sportswriters know not to linger
too long after an interview or be too friendly to the
players. Lisa Olson did neither of these things, yet
she was still treated like she was nothing, not even
a person.

.Lisa Olson, and many other female reporters like
her, deserve respect for the job they do. Maybe one
day the Patriots (and other teams) will realize that
thanks" to reporters, people know who they are.

Lisa Raff is a freshman English writing major.

Erickson has already posted up
some impressive numbers, going
147-252 for a whopping 2,145
yards with 13 touchdowns and a
142.9 pass- efficiency rating.
Miarni’s receiving corps has
combined for 158 catches for
2,240 yards.

But Miami may have garnered
the ultimate decoy with this
passing reputation. They set teams
up with the pass but kill with the
run. And Pitt Coach Paul Hackett
is duly worried about the gale-
force ground game.

“What’s scary is the run. They
give you the passing formation,
and of course they have the
passing reputation and the ability
to pass, but they run to beat you.
This is the most balanced run-
and—pass attack we’ve seen,”

Hackett said. A v

The Hurricanes have gained 99
first downs passing and 70 rushing
but have stuck it in the end zone
18 times on the ground, as
compared to 13 via airmail this
year.

Last year fullback Steve
McGuire replaced starter Leonard
Conley and tore up the turf at Pitt
Stadium in a 24-3 Hurricane
offensive barrage. McGuire ran
for 114 of the ‘Canes 199 yards.
To boot, Erickson threw for 317
yards. A balanced attack, to say
the least.

Both Conley and McGuire are
ready to go Saturday, posing the
threat of a dual ground attack.
The two‘ have combined for 850
rushing yards and 14 TDs so far.

“Our philosophy is to come
out and throw the ball first. But
we felt that we’ve had to get
better running the football, not
necessarily for more yardage, but

to counter our passing attack
with a fairly strong running game,”
said Hurricane head coach Dennis
Erickson — no relation to Craig.

But don’t count out the passing .

attack, still the bread and butter
of a potent Hurricane offense.
Starters Wesley Carroll (slot back),
Randall Hill (SE) and Lamar
Thomas (FL) are all back and
boast the top three receiving spots
on Mia.mi’s stat sheet. The trio has
combined for 93 catches for 1,462
yards and eight TDs.

“We have some threats out
there, and it’s difficult to double-
cover any particular [receiver]
because all are fairly equal. But
now we’re fairly balanced, and
I've really been happy with the
way we run the football, and I
think that’s made us a better
football team in 1990,” Erickson
said. 4

On defense the ‘Canes boast
one of the best defensive linemen
in the nation in Russell Maryland,
a senior with 63 tackles (38 solo)
and the respect of every coach
that sends a team out to face him.

Maryland has been consistently
double-teamed in every game
with nearly every snap of the
ball, and opponents still can’t
figure out how to slow him down.

“We’re not nearly the defensive
football team we were a year
ago,” Erickson said, “but in my
opinion Russell Maryland is the
best defensive lineman in the
country this year. He should win
the Outland Trophy; he’s that
kind of a player.” ‘

Miami uses a 4-3 defensive
scheme, one similar to that of the
Louisville Cardinals. And many
Pitt players have been singing
the praises of the Cardinal
defense, saying that it is better,
faster and more dangerous than
Notre Dame’s.

Well, the Panthers will certainly
have their hands full in the Orange
Bowl. Miami's defense is a mirror
image of Louisville's, with one
major difference.

“They've got team speed
everywhere. Notre Dame has the
Rocket, but this team has team

 

speed on both sides of the ball,”
Hackett said. “They are quick,
swarming, punishing tacklers, a
true ‘bend but don’t break’
defense. Their speed is just
incredible, and they’re playing
much better than they did a year
ago.”

Regardless of how well the
Hurricanes are playing, they are
basically out of the national-

championship hunt with losses
to Notre Dame and BYU. Miami
has not —lost two games in the
regular season since 1984, and
the team’s current goal is just to
finish in the top five in the nation
and go to a major bowl.

Lofty goals by many university
standards, but subpar objectives
and disappointment for the
Hurricanes.

. Fullback Steve McGuire is Miami's leading rushing threat with 484  and nine touchdowns this year.

But maybe Miami is the
country's best team in disguise, at
least in Hackett’s opinion.

“Well I thought that last week

we- were getting ready to play the
best team in the country, until I

Pitt boops opens exhibition season against Marat/yon Oil

   

 

By Derek Willis
Staff Writer

A slightly banged—up Pitt basketball team
will take the floor at Fitzgerald Field
House tonight at 8, opening its 1990-91
season with an exhibition againstMarathon
Oil.

Brian Shorter, the leading scorer and
rebounder for the Panthers the last two
years, is suffering from a viral infection
and will miss this game and possibly the
second exhibition game against a team
from Melbourne, Australia. In addition,
Darelle Porter and Bobby Martin have
both been slowed by injuries: Porter With
knee tendinitis and Martin with a sprained
ankle.

The Panthers do bring more depth into
the season than last year. With eight new

players, Coach Paul Evans has many more
possibilities to work with. Two of the
newcomers, forwards Chris McNeal and
Antoine Jones, are also recovering from
groin pulls. .

Marathon Oil is a corporate-sponsored
team, which is beginning its seven-game
tour of the Big East tonight. After Pitt it
faces Connecticut, Providence and Boston
College, playing four games in four days,
then it completes its tour with Seton Hall,
Villanova and Syracuse.

Marathon Oil is composed of ex—college
players, mostly from smaller schools. This
team features Todd May, a 6-foot-9~inch
forward from Pikeville College, an NAIA
school in Kentucky. May is college
basketball’s all-time leading scorer with
over 4,000 points in his career. Kelby
Stuckey, a 6-foot-7-inch power forward

from Southwest Missouri State, is the team’s
top defensive player. A three-year starter
in college, Stuckey’s teams posted 71 wins
in that span. ~

Six-foot guardJeffTimberlake of Boston
University is one of the team’s younger
players and a decent outside shooter. In
his final two seasons at BU, the Terriers
made two NCAA Tournament appearances.
Other players on the squad include Mike
Barach (North Park College), Victor
Fleming (Xavier), Darrin Houston (Oregon
State),Jeff Ford (SouthwestMissouri State),
Tim Carr (Delaware) and Sam Foggin
(Virginia Tech).

Teams like Marathon Oil generally do
not practice or play much together, as they
are traveling during most of their “season.”
While it probably won’t provide a stiff test
for Evans’ squad, it will give him a chance

to see his team play someone besides
each other after two weeks of inter-squad
games. This game will give Pitt fans a look
at Sean Miller in his return to action after
a medical—redshirt year. But with Shorter
on the sidelines, several of the younger
players, particularly Jones, McNeal and
freshman Gandhi Jordan will be forced
into the spotlight early.

After Marathon Oil, Pitt faces a team
from Melbourne on Nov. 15. That team
features former Seton Hallstar Andrew
Gaze and will bring a higher level of
competition to the field house.

Volleyball team takes

Pitt Tournament easily

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt volleyball team raised its record to 24-4 (6-0 in the
Big East) by winning its own tournament last night in the small
gym at Trees Hall with a four game victory over the Akron Zips
(32-11) and a three game win over Youngstown State (11-20).

The Lady Panthers struggled in the first two games, winning
the first game 15-11 and losing the second 15-15. They took
control of the match in the third game, raising theirlevel of play
as Akron seemed to come apart. They won the last two games
by scores of 15-6 and 15-12.

“We played down to their level,” Coach Sue Woodstra said
of the Akron match. “We made a lot of stupid, unforced errors.
I don’t know how many serves we missed. We missed a lot of
serves. It’s hard coming up against teams we should beat easily
and maintaining our concentration.”

The team made a season high 23 service errors. They had a
.254 kill percentage compared to only .190 for the Zips and out-
dug Akron 66 to 62. Junior outside hitter, Heather Hollands led
the team in kills with 16 and digs with 14. Jill McCreary had 21
kills and 14 digs for the Zips.

The Lady Panthers dominated play against a totally outclassed
Youngstown State team, winning by scores of 15-4, 15-7, 15-4.
Senior co-captain Michele Adarnson, junior middle-hitter Dee
MacAuley, and junior middle-hitter Susan Zonneville tied for
the team lead in kills with seven. Zonneville had the top kill
percentage with .636, and MacAuley was tops in digs with eight.

The team was down to seven players for the tournament.
Junior outside hitter Bridget Gary aggravated a knee injury she
suffered earlier this season in last Friday’s match against the
Southern Illinois Salukis and has not played since. .

Freshman outside-hitter Ann Marie Lucanie, who was having
an outstanding season before suffering a sprained ankle Oct. 6,
may return soon.

The team will play its final Big East match of the season
Saturday against Seton Hall at Fitzgerald Field House. “Seton
Hall is much improved this season.” Woodstra said, “They have
some good, young players — freshmen players, and we expect
them to come in here thinking they can beatlus.”

Pitt soccer eds season on hih note

By Christopher Block
Smﬂ‘ Writer

The Pitt soccer team ended its
season in dramatic fashion
Wednesday night with an uplifting
victory over the Grove City
Wolverines. The Panthers used
an aggressive offensive attack and
a stifling defense, complemented
by a strong performance from
goalkeeper Jay Kapusta to end

their rocky season with a 1-0 .

victory.
Grove City began the game
aggressively, continuously

sending the ball into the Panther
end of the field. The Wolverines
used a variety of set plays in
hopes of jumping on an early
lead. The Panther defense,
however, stood strong and was
able to clear the ball out on every
occasion. The Panthers first
scoring opportunity came at 40
minutes, 10 seconds of the first
half when senior Roberto Croce
lined a shot on goal.
Unfortunately, the ball sailed over
the net. I

Croce was one of three seniors
playing in his last game for the
Panthers. The other two were
Kapusta and mid—fielder Bryan
Hammond. All three played
strong in their collegiate ﬁnale
and were treated to a loud ovation
at the end of the game.

In the the second half junior
Mark Brehn took a penalty kick
for the Panthers at the 14 yard
line, and the ball was knocked
around the goal mouth. Junior

Davis, Pitt celebrate
20th Anniversary

By Cheryl Neidlinger
Staff Writer

This year the Pitt Jazz Seminar
and Concert celebrates its 20th
year with another all—star lineup
of jazz greats. Created by Pitt
Professor Nathan Davis, the
seminar was the first academically
oriented jazz seminar in the
country to invite professional
musicians to share their skills
with aspiring music students.

Davis has continued to act as
director of the seminar since its
conception and is proud of the
prestige and success the program
has enjoyed. “It has brought the
true history of jazz to this campus
by bringing in artists who have
had a big part in writing that
history,” he said. “Who better to
teach about jazz than practitioners
who have been out there living
it?”

The very first seminar took
place in April 1970. Davis was a
world-class musician who
decided to take a break from the
road and sign a three—year contract
at the University of Pittsburgh.

“I came here directly from
Paris,” he said. “I was only going
to stay here the three years and
then go back  Anyway, Art
Blakey was in town that spring at
the Crawford Grill in the Hill
District. I played with him in his
group, the Jazz Messengers,
before I moved to Pittsburgh, so
when he heard I was teaching at
Pitt, he called me up and told me
to bring my sax. I sat in with
them, and I swear, in between
every song he would introduce
me again and say, ‘This is Nathan

Davis, who used to play with me
in the Jazz Messengers. I taught
him everything he knows!”

Since Blakey was so excited to
see him that night, Davis took
advantage of the opportunity and
asked him and his band to come
over to Pitt and talk to students.
They came, and what resulted
was a giant clinic and concert all
in one, with each member of the
band talking about his instrument,
and then the entire ensemble
playing. “It was just packed with
people, and it was so successful
that we decided to try to make it
an annual event,” he said.

A committee of people from
different departments in the
university was soon formed for
the sole purpose of organizing
the seminar.

“The idea was not to have just
workshops but for musicians to
come in, in a scholarly fashion
and present themselves and their
art,” said Davis. “A lot of schools

Nathan Davis has brought Pitt's jazz Seminar international acclaim.

all over the country were having
band contests or workshops or
things like that, but we were
really the first to have the jazz
master come in and teach and

play. The concert itself was not ,

intended to be just a big jam
session; it was designed to be a
sort of showcase of the talents
and styles and interpretations of

each of our players.”

Over the years the seminar has
seen its share of superstars. People
like Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny
Rollins, John Lewis, Herbie Mann
and James Moody have taken

time out of their busy schedules
to take part. Pitt’s seminar has
also been lucky to have witnessed
the talents of legends like Emily
Remler, Dexter Gordon, Kenny
Clarke and Art Blakey, who have
all since passed away.

Davis has fond memories of
these musicians and their
participation in the seminar. “I
remember I invited Kenny Clarke
here, and he had not been to the
States in 20 years. Yale University
wanted him to _come over and
accept a jazz achievement award,
and he told them he would come

Sax star comes to Pitt...
A conversation with Grover Washington Jr.

By Cheryl Neidlinger
Staff Writer

Among the list of jazz superstars who will be
participating in this year's Pitt Jazz Seminar is
Grammy—award-winning saxophonist Grover
Washington Jr. With one of the most productive
and commercially successful careers in jazz to his
credit, he is a very busy man. Yet, he always seems
to find time to participate in Pitt’s seminar, calling
it “the best of its kind, no doubt.” Several weeks ago
Washington called The Pitt News to talk about the
seminar and about his good friend, seminar director
Nathan Davis, Ph.D.

“The thing I like best about the PittJazz Seminar
is that you get a chance to talk one--on-one with
your audience,” he said. “They have a chance to
ask questions, and if you feel like you can’t answer
them, there’s somebody else there to refer to.

“Programs like that let the audience have an
insight to the artist, which most of the time allows
the students to find out that we are not one-
dimensional people. We are concerned citizens
first and foremost, and then we just try to play the

best music that we can.

“When I'm at Pitt, a lot more information goes out
to the students, and the persons who are conducting
the seminars always seem to learn something also,”
he continued. “It’s really a full circle — a sharing of
information, an appreciation of one’s talent, whether
they are a student or a working musician. “

Washington met Davis several years ago when
Washington came through Pittsburgh on tour. A
short time afterward, Davis invited him to participate
in Pitt’s Jazz Seminar, and since then the two have
become good friends. Washington has nothing but
admiration and respect for Davis. “I -like being
around Nathan because he just seems to make
things happen. He is an excellent educator. He
hasn’t_ forgone the performing side of his talent, and
he is a complete person.”

As advice to young musicians at Pitt, Washington V

offers the following: “Go and see Nathan Davis. He
will lay everything out for you so that you understand
it. He will tell you what things to check out and why
——{he will tell you] what parts of your conception
will be strengthened by it. He gives you the
complete road map; all you have to do is take the
right direction and handle a little constructive
criticism along the way.”

Lie of the Mind a sexual,

By Jennifer Davis

Staﬂ’ Writer

“Shepard is holding the family
up to the light, and sometimes
t.he light shows things that are
really ugly but very true,” says
Peter Harrigan, director of the
University of Pittsburgh's
production of A Lie of the Mind
by Sam Shepard.

Things are not just ugly; they're
powerful, sexual and dynamic.

The play is a roller- coaster ride
through the painful reality of
domestic violence, the rage of
true love, the punctured sanctity
of human sexual identity and the
fall of the traditional nuclear
family.

A Lie of the Mind not only
pushes us to the edge of reality
but also tears at our hearts with
relentless force. Even after all of
this exposure, you leave with a
somewhat better‘ understanding

of the world and a small pain in
your side from laughing.

As you enter the theater, you
get an instant feeling that things
are not what they are supposed
to be. The stage is simple yet
complex with relatively few props
but scattered pictures of the
“ideal” gender roles. Love songs,
by Elvis Presley and Patsy Cline,
that are tainted with pain are
played subtly, yet effectively,
through the entire show.

The songs are a constant
reminder of love gone bad.
Everyone knows how songs haunt
us, although we have an
overriding need to hear them.
And with the help of these fictional
lovers, are needs our intensiﬁed.

The play centers around two

dynamic roller-coaster ride

together in a relationship driven
by a fine line between intense
sexual power and physical
violence triggered by jealousy.
After a ruthless ﬁght, Jake leaves
Beth severely brain damaged and

on the edge of death. In order to

deal with his loss and painful
childhood memories, he then
returns home to his mother
Lorraine (Patrice DeGraff-Arenas),
his sister Sally (Maryel1en Rowlett)
and his brother Frankie (Terry W.
Klann). Together they explore
the depths of childhood pain,
while at the same time exposing
their true inner needs.

Beth’s family is reunited to help
her overcome her disability. Her
brother Mike (Dave Drayer)
struggles to seek revenge onjake,
while her father Baylor (David J.
Fielding) and her mother Meg
(Barbara Stuart) escape the truth
by drowning in their set gender
roles.

The themes are thrown your
way in very different manners.
Some scenes are lighter and
indirect. Others are frighting,
powerful and very ‘direct,
including spur—of-the—moment

brutal fights and an engulfing
mutual masturbation scene.

Ironically, the play opens on
Halloween and runs through Nov.
10 in the Studio Theatre.

Pitt director brings

 

By Jennifer Davis
Staﬁ" Writer

Peter Harrigan has done a lot

‘Aof acting, a little bit of costume

R‘;

  
 
  

design and some set design. And
now he’s bringing all of these
things together into one unified
vision through directing.

“Directing is the best way to
combine a lot of creative
impulses,” says Harrigan, one of
the younger directors of Pitt’s
mainstage productions.
‘ As an undergraduate theatre-
arts advisor with a masters in fine
arts in directing, he is currently
directing Sam Shepard’s play A
Lie of the Mind. “I think it’s a
stunning and beautiful play,” says
Harrigan. “I am trying to bring
different American family myths
into focus.”

He feels that sometimes
directors go too far and impose
things on a play that are not

  Shepard into focus

“I have a lot of respect for the
playwright," explains Harrigan.
“Sol try to pull out things that are
already there, rather than sticking
things in.”.

“As a director, you have to
bring all of the other artists to
your idea, while at the same time
trying to funnel [your] ideas
through their talents and
creativity. ”

Harrigan feels that the Studio
Theatre is the perfect place to
perform Shepard’s plays because
the intimacy makes the power of
the play work. “The audience is
only 10 feet away from something
that’s terrifying,” says Harrigan.

On the other hand, he has
found that a refreshing bit of
humor is also starting to emerge
from the play. “When you start
digging into such heavy subject
material,” he says, “it would be
an unpleasant experience for the
audience if it were justa relentless

necessarily inherent in the script. hitting of ugly truths.”

The Sex Pistols and the
Buzzcocks, at the head of the
punk invasion, had their moment
in the spotlight and then faded
into obscurity almost as quickly
as they had risen to fame. But
that’s what punk was all about:
ﬂeeting, fast and furious.
Permanency was a little-known
concept, but there are exceptions.

Britain’s G.B.H. has persevered
as a living tribute to punk. For 10
 years the band has centered its
mm life around producing menacing,

ultra—vio1ent music. There ’s been

1 causing harm

little change in the band, except
for the inclusion of Kai Reder as
its new drummer in 1986. Colin
Abrahall (vocals), Ross Lomas
(bass) and Jock Blyth (guitar)
have been founders/friends since
G.B.H.’s beginning in 1980.

G.B.H. has been the acronym
that’s represented the band and
its explosive, speedcore style, but
the letters’ actual meaning doesn’t
necessarily reflect the intentions
of the band.

“IGBHI is a police charge,” says
Colin. “It stands for ‘grievous
bodily harm,’ but we don’t like to
refer to it like that often.”

Colin's husky British accent
crackles over the telephone line
from the band’s rehearsal studio
in Birmingham, England.
Compared to the bristled mass of
spiky blond hair and quivering
ﬂesh that he transforms into on
stage, Colin speaks in a calm,
reserved manner. He seems
almost introverted.

The punk movement began
out of a rebellion against
traditional social values. In the

. same way, G.B.H. was fostered
when the members tired of their
monotonous routines in the
murky, industrial England they
call home.

“We were all mates; we used to
drink in the same pubs together,”
says Colin. “The club we always
went to played dance, and there
wasn’t any place to go get wild. It
was sort of to entertain ourselves.”

G.B.H. has compiled an
impressive discography over the
years, including four singles, five
FPS and six albums. Most recently,
the band released From Here to
Reality on Restless Records —
another searing indication of its
unchanging, frenzied style.

G.B.H. kicks off its From Here
To Reality Tour of the United
States in Pittsburgh at Graﬂiti on
Nov. 1. Tentative plans have the
band touringlapan latertbis year.
