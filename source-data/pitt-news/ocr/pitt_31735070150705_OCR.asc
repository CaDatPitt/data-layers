MAYORAL ELECTION

Ravenstahl kicks off re-election campaign

Parthena Moisiadis
Staﬂ‘ Wrz'ter

Aletheia Henry, Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl’s campaign manager, thinks 13
is a lucky number. With 13 Tuesdays
between now and primary election
day and 13 hours to gather votes on
election day, 2013 is full of both su-
perstition and hope for the Raven-
stahl campaign team. ._.

Hundreds of people gathered at 6
p.m. in the basement of Ravenstahl’s
campaign headquarters in the Strip
District last night for the mayor’s

Campaign Kickoff Ofﬁce Opening
and Petition Party. In a 15-minute
speech to campaign supporters at
the event, Ravenstahlcovered a
range of topics including job growth,
investment in neighborhoods and
ﬁscal responsibility. A
Ravenstahl, who has served as
mayor of Pittsburgh since fall of
2006, is running for mayor against
City Councilman Bill Peduto and
City Controller Michael Lamb in this
year’s Democratic primary. The elec-
tion is set to take place on May 21.
After several introductory

speeches by members of the mayor’s
campaign team, Henry called Ra-
venstahl to the stage. In a black suit
jacket and patterned red tie, Raven-
stahl approached the microphone
at 6:45 p.m. '

Before he had time to reach the
stage, supporters had risen from
their seats with amplifying applause
and hollers from various individu-
als chanting “Luke” in low, strong
voices.

Standing in front of a white
backdrop covered by hundreds of
children’s signatures painted in

various colors and a painted mural
of the mayor amidst notable Pitts-
burgh scenery, Ravenstahl began his
speech by declaring that he believes
in what is happening in the city and
claiming that “now is the best time
to be in Pittsburgh.”

“There are more people working
in Pittsburgh than ever before,” he
said, citing statistics that the em-

« ployment rate is higher than it was

during the height of the city’s steel
industry days.

Correction: In Monday’s article, “Pitt witnesses decline in student social activism,” the article stated that the 1964 U.S. presidential election was between Republican Richard

Professor lectures on copyright law and intellectual property

Elizabeth Furiga
For The Pitt News

Fire destroyed mankind’s greatest library in
Alexandria, Egypt, but America’s intricate
copyright law could decimate the dream of
the great informational stronghold of this
century: a comprehensive digital library.
Pamela Samuelson, a former Pitt law
professor and current University of Cali-
fornia-Berkeley professor, spoke Tuesday
afternoon in the Teplitz Memorial Moot

Courtroom of the University of Pittsburgh g

Law School.

During her presentation and the follow-
ing question—and-answer session, Samuel-
son addressed the role of intellectual copy-
right law and the restriction it places on an
ultimate digital library, leaving the room of
about 40 people with a warning.

' “All the knowledge we have could go
dark,” Samuelson said.

Samuelson focused the majority of her
lecture on Authors Guild v. Google, a case
that took place in 2005. The disagreement
between the parties began when Google

sought to work with research universities
and institutes to use their resources to
scan books and transfer digital copies of
the works back to their original institutions.
At the same time, however, Google worked
to assemble a digital library accessible to all.
The Authors Guild — a nonproﬁt advocacy
group for authors’ rights —— and ﬁve trade
publishers ﬁled a class—action lawsuit against
Google, claiming that the company’s actions
violated fair-use agreements. Google an-
nounced in 2009 it had reached an initial
settlement of the class lawsuit by the authors

and publishers that was valued at $125 mil-»

lion; however, litigation by authors has not
been settled.

 So began one of the ﬁrst obstacles in cre-

ating a digital library.

Google managed to keep public domain
books — those made before copyright law
—‘—’,“and snippets of books with copyrighted
material on the Google Books search service.

 “It’s not the universal digital library, but
getting closer. If AG wins, it will impound
 destroy a 20 million corpus of literature.
It-Egoizould be a tragedy,” Samuelsonsaid;,.. .

Google argued that copying the out-of-
print books was in line with its rights un-

der fair-use regulations because its system .

mirrored a card catalog, which indexed the
words of the publication and only provided
full texts of documents in the public domain.
Google also argued that they only supplied
searchable online summariesfor books pro-
tected by copyright and used the scanned
books and search data for computational
analysis to assist with internet searches and
improving the Google Translate feature.
The Authors Guild ﬁled‘ a second suit
against HathiTrust, another-jdigital library
provider, on Sept. 12, 2011. In the lawsuit,
the Authors Guild alleged that HathiTrust
committed copyright infringement against

them. HathiTrust works to take orphan

books -— those out of print  and put them
into a digital database. Through this data-
base, academics can searchéfor any topic,
historical or otherwise, andiﬁnd pieces of
information from over 10 million books.
Samuelson articulated that more institu-
tion—based and author—based action needs to
be taken, rather than suing Google outright.

Ultimately, she explained, the online digital
library should be created because there is a
need for more than public domain books.

“A class—action settlement is not the ap-
propriate way to bring about a public li-
brary,” Samuelson said.

Samuelson c'ited alternatives to the
Google Books approach that would allow
copyright to be more open. She called atten-
tion to the Open Book Alliance — a group
working to counteract the Authors Guild
— to speak for all authors, academic and
otherwise. The Alliance hopes to help au-
thors convert copyright back to themselves
after their books go out of print, rather than
remaining in the publishers’ hands.

In Nordic countries, extended collective

‘ licenses have worked to create open digi-

tal access to literature. These are managed
through collective management organiza-
tions. But, Samuelson said, the U.S. gov-
ernmental structure of copyright law would
make that system tricky and unappealing
to most authors involved in the potential

RAVENSTAHL

Ravenstahl noted that much has changed
in Pittsburgh over the last 30 years. According
to Ravenstahl, 30 years ago, there was a 17 to
18 percent unemployment rate, which caused
50,000 people to leave the city. Currently, he
said, the population is growing.

The current mayor added that this pattern
of positive change has continued in his time
as head of city government.

Ravenstahl attributed the change he’s over-
seen duringhis six years in office to three major
points —— an economic climate for growth,

investment in the neighborhoods of the city ,'

and taking ﬁscal responsibility.

Ravenstahl said he was able to create a
climate for growth in his position as mayor
through a commitment to keep taxes low and
do more with less. _

He added that he has invested in the neigh-
borhoods of the city, improving them over
the years. .

“North, west, east and south — everyone’s
well represented,” he said. “We make sure [the
neighborhoods] are safe and clean. The crime
rate is 25 percent lower than it was six years
ago, and that’s a testament to the hard-working

day night . Kenny ()n§f5|VisuaI Editor

men of the police department.”
Ravenstahl said that efforts to improve
the quality of surrounding neighborhoods

, included removing abandoned structures and

creating garden space.

He also addressed the issue of ﬁscal re-

sponsibility, saying that although he has had to

Mayor Luke Rvenstahl kicked off his re-election campaig

   

n inthe strip’ District Tues-

tum some people down when they requested
money for a project, the results have been a
reduction in city debt.

Tracy Sun, a sophomore;  Pitt, attended
the evening’s event to show  p;support for the
mayor’s past and present initiatives.

Although Sun assisted President Barack

 

. Obama in his 2012 campaign for tl\1e'U.S. presi-

dency, she has not volunteered for any local
campaigns. But this year, Sun plans to volun-
teer by canvassing for Ravenstahl.

She insisted that the mayoral election is
speciﬁcally important for Pitt students.

“It’s local, so it almost affects Pitt students
more than the presidential election,” she said.
“Although not as many people pay attention
to it, it’s still important.” "

Sun expressed her doubts that the student
population would become involved in the may-
oral election. , -

“I’m not sure they even know who our

A mayor is,” she said. I .

While the student contingent at the event
was small, other members of the Pitt com-
munity attended as well. _

Jennifer Satler, mock trial coach at Pitt Law,
attended Ravenstahl’s event as part of her at-
tempt to attend every mayoral event. Satler’s

interest in the race derives, in part, from her -

own campaign for a spot on{the’Allegheny
County Court of Common Pleas.“ .

Although Satler’s presencewas non-politi-
cal, she said that it is vital that students become
involved in local politics. T ’

 A p‘.‘It’s convenient to get, to the events and
it’s important to have your voice heard,” she

said. “It’s also good preparation for real life.”

when speaking to about 30 people gath-
ered in Nordy’s Place of the WPU at their
weekly public meeting on Tuesday night.
Accommodations were made to include Al-
locations requests from the previous week,
since the Board canceled the public meeting
scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 12, because of
Pitt Day in Harrisburg.

In a review of Pitt Day in Harrisburg,
Louderback said he thought it was a suc-
cessful event and thanked the students who
attended. Beecher, the main coordinator
of Pitt Day in Harrisburg, also thanked the
attendees and said that the event was great
both in logistical and sentimental terms.

Beecher said that over the next few weeks
students would have the chance to write
letters and make phone calls to legislators
to continue to make a lasting impression of
Pitt’s presence in the Commonwealth.

In his project update, Cordier said he
had made a spreadsheet of the positive and
negative aspects of Pitt Day in Harrisburg,

and would have it ready for the person who _

would take on the event next year.

Louderback reminded the Board mem-
bers that next Tuesday would be the ﬁrst
deadline for their individual projects, when
all Board members and committee chairs
will give a summary of what they’ve done on
their projects since taking ofﬁce. For Loud-
erback, it will be a way to keep members and
chairs accountable.

process because it would lead, to highly

constrictive copyright laws.

Several students from the graduate-lev-
el library track of Pitt’s School of Informa-
tion Sciences attended the lecture, which
fit their interests in archival management
and research.

Samuelson’s warning of the darkness
that will be left in the place of destroyed
Google archived knowledge —- if the cases
side in favor of the Authors Guild and those

' who felt fair use was violated — resonated

with the group. The thought of loss caused
them to reflect on the impact that the court

cases could have on future career choices.

One of the graduate students at the lec-

ture, Anastasia Matijkiw, saidthe lecture
made her “consider. things such as how
we’re thinking about presenting archives,
material and other artifacts in the future.”

The lecture also left Mark Clements,
also a 1ibrary—track graduate student,
thinking about the role of government in
copyright law. - A -

“I realized government initiatives are
invaluable,” Clements said.

Meg Macavoy, a graduate student
studying archival management, reflected
on the lecture, saying that it got her think-
ing about open—access repositories and
the general appeal that the issue holds for
universities, researchers and government
workers alike. 5 » p

‘The issue is bipartisan — one of few,”
Macavoy said. ] 1

Casualigamers, beware:

l"lI'ieInloko Ballo

Whether you’re a hardcore gamer
who spends hours racking up Call
of Duty kill streaks or just a casual
player who uses Angry Birds to
kill time, you should be very con-
cernedabout the future of digital
rights management. ,

DRM refers to any technol-
ogy that limits the use of digital‘
content and devices after sale.
It’s the reason why you can’t eas-
ily make copies of DVD movies
or play multiplayer modes with a
pirated game. The intent of DRM
is to combat copyright infringe-

ment and protect proﬁts, but its
implementation often punishes
the honest -yconsumer. And if ear-
ly reports are any indication of
what to expect, DRM is going to
mercilessly dish out punishment
with the next generation of home
consoles. 4‘: ’ r
Though there has been no
official cdhﬁrmation, various
online publications report that
Microsoft’s next Xbox console
will use “always—on” DRM. This
means it will require an Internet
connection? just to function, since
the deviceﬁvill constantly have to
authenticate itself to Microsoft’s

servers. This idea isn’t entirely -

new: Some current titles, includ-
ing Blizzard Entertainment’s pop-
ular Diablo 3, require an Internet
connection even for solo play.
The radical new idea includes
another rumored DRM feature of
the next Xbox: a single-use activa-
tion code for games. Activation
will tie a copy of a game to one ac-
count or system, effectively elimi-
nating the entire market of used
games. And’Microsoft isn’t alone
on this. Onjan. 3, it was revealed
that Sony, the company behind
the PlayStation, patented RFID
tags for game discs that would

Kennedy had to go and get himself shot.

An awesome night, I’m sure, but worth
bragging about for 50 years? Probably not.

Clinging can be dangerous. Cling to too
many objects and you’re on “Hoarders.”
Cling to too many emotions and memories
and you’re on “Dr. Phil.”

If you don’t want people to yell at you
“Why don’t you move on already!?” but
simply still aren’t able to move beyond

the past, you can always pretend that you’,
actually have something new, not just a ’

bedazzled and freshly painted relic.

There are a few ways to fool others, and
even yourself, that you’re not a Clinger.

If it’s an object you have trouble let-
ting go of, try making it into something
new. Turn your fourth-grade hockey medal
into a belt buckle or your teddy bear into
a voodoo doll. Nothing screams “I’m so
over it” more than mutilated childhood
possessions. .

Another tactic is to imbue it with magi-
cal powers, real or fake. Who in his right
mind would give away “Dragon Ball Z”
cards that can predict the future or a Bar-
bie who grants you one wish when you
pull off her head?

If neither of these options works, just
say that your precious memento is vintage.

There are different strategies for mem-

ory—clingers. ‘For instance, as a clinger,

you will inevitably be telling the same

story over and over again. The key is to

make the memory seem better than itsis ’

so that people will listen to you when you

rehash the story for the 50th time.

One suggestion is to add a soundtrack
to your memories. Carry around a boom-
box, and whenever you start to retell the
hackneyed story of prom night with your
ex, hit play, and wow them with some

to

Coldplay or Vanessa Carlton. I’d stay away -

from the cliche violins, however, since
classical can put people to sleep, and this
is a story they’ll deﬁnitely want to hear.
Again.

If you really need to up the drama to

keep people from rolling their eyes, add _.

zombies. It worked for “Pride and Preju-
dice,” one of the most retold stories on the
planet, so it should work for you.

That time you couldn’t get in to The
Black Keys concert? Good thing, because
everyone in the auditorium got mauled by
zombies. That test you failed and can’t
stop whining about? Graded by zombies.
That boy you hooked up with last weekend
who keeps calling you? Zombie.

‘ If none of these sound like acceptable
tactics, you might just have to accept that
it’s time to give it up. Moving on can be
hard, but sometimes you have to accept
that things are over and hope that bet-
ter moments and things are in your near
future.

Maybe Fall Out Boy is genuinely trying
to create a new sound instead of attempt-
ing to relive the past. However, if they add
zombie-themed‘ special effects to their
new tour andlbrag about their vintage
guitars, I won’t be fooled.I

prevent a game from working on any

console but that of the original buyer.
Video game publishers and developers

have long complained that piracy dimin-

‘ ishes profits and that they don’t see any

revenue from the continual resale of used
games. Both grievances are valid. Always-
on DRM is an inept approach to combat-
ing piracy, yet it’s tolerable so long as
you’re not gaming on the go. But DRM
that restricts the use of a game disc to
one physical device is completely outra-
geous. It’s a measure not aimed at pirates

— who are guilty of actually breaking
the law — but at honest consumers who
make legal purchases. DRM of this kind
prevents individuals from being able to
resell their property and drastically re-
duces purchase options for consumers.
And purchaseoptions mean more than
just price differences between new and
pre-owned; they used market is a home
'for obscure and older games no longer"
carried by traditional retailers.
Although DRM of this type might in-
crease proﬁts for publishers and develop-
ers, it would kill businesses that rely on
used-game sales or game rentals. Game-
Stop, a popular video game retailer, made
the majority of its 2011 revenue from

used-game and used-hardware sales. Fo‘l'- 4
lowing the announcement of Sony’s RFI_D

patent, the price of Gamestop shares
fell-to $1.67 over asingle day, shortly
after reaching a high of $25.67 earlier
in January.

Even without considering the larger
consequences for consumersor busi-
nesses, DRM this restrictive is wrong
on principle alone: It cripples the core
functions of a device. Computers can
copy ﬁles, consoles can play game discs.
Adding arbitrary process complications
that restrict which ﬁles can be copied
or which discs can be played is justjan

attempt to gimp a perfectly functional

device. Breaking usable systems is a

i...

backward and ineffective approach to

protecting data.

And this is where the ﬁnal problem
with DRM comes into play: It won’t re-
ally work. People will hack their devices

to recover basic native functions. Tech— V

savvy gamers will ﬁnd a way to share
their games with friends, even if it voids
a warranty. Pirates will still use modi-
ﬁed consoles to play pirated game discs.
Third—party digital distribution services
will replace the used-game market. There
will be enough backlash against DRM to
render it ineffective. The only person-to
pay the price — quite literally — for DRM
in games will be the average consumer.

Pitt dominates Wichita State for shocking series sweep

Tyler Pecyna
Szfaﬁ" Wrz'ter

The Pitt baseball team was faced with the
daunting challenge of opening its 2013 season

on the road against Wichita State, winners of . I

69 consecutive home games in February un—i
der legendary head coach Gene Stephenson.

But surprisingly to many college base-
ball fans, the Panthers emerged from the
three—game set against the Shockers with a
perfect record.

The Panthers (3-0), unfazed by the history
on Wichita State’s side, scored an impres-
sive 27 runs in the three contests with the

,, Shockers (0-3).

The Pitt pitching was slightly less spec-
tacular, surrendering 15 runs in the series,
but it was sufficient enough to keep the Pan-
thers aﬂoat. S

Junior pitcher Ethan Mildren believes that
the sweep was the perfect way for Pitt to begin
the new season.

“It was a great series win for us to start the

year off with,” Mildren said in an interview. S

“We had great pitching from the starters and
relievers,played solid defense and got timely
hits when we needed it most.”

Mildren startesd the series ,opener;with a
qualitylstartonlthe mound, allowing just six
base runners while striking out nine‘Slio_ick-
ers over seven innings. He said the team was
anxious to ﬁnally begin the season.

“We’ve been preparing for this day for a
long time,” Mildren said. “We had a great plan
laid out and everyone went out and executed.”

Though Mildren did not receive the win,

WOMEWS BASKETBALL

Panthers hope to ﬁnally end confegence losing streak

Dave Uhrmacher
V Stqff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team has an
opportunity Wednesday night.

The Panthers will either suffer their
32nd consecutive Big East regu1ar—season
defeat or they will grab a much-needed
victory on the way to Hartford, Conn.,
for the Big East tournament in two weeks.

The Panthers (9-15, 0-11 Big East) host

-Cincinnati on Wednesday evening at 7

p.m./ at the Petersen Events Center in a
matchup of Big East cellar dwellers. Pitt
enters the contest winless in conference
play, and the Bearcats’ (9-16, 1-11 Big

East) only Big East victory this season
occurred on Feb. 13 when they upset Mar-
quette, 54-52. V g

In what surely is the best chance for
the Panthers to finally ‘end their un-
wanted, more-than-two-year conference
losing streak, the contest also presents
head coach Agnus Berenato’s team with
an opportunity to fix the problems that
led to its 80-39 demolition at the hands
of Syracuse on Saturday.

“We missed shots early on, and they
got transition points out of those,” Bere-
nato said after the Syracuse game. “We
were going to the boards, but we weren’t
knocking down shots.”

4.6:-

Pitt will also enter the game already
having to deal with some adversity.

Pitt will be without, services of
starting freshman pointiﬁard Brittany
Gordon due toher season? inding shoul-
der surgery. In Gordon’s iﬁsence, junior
guard Marquel Davis has stepped into the
starting lineup and performed with mixed
results. Against Syracuse, Davis was the
lone bright spot, ﬁnishing as the only
Panther in double figures? with 12 points
in the blowout defeat tot e Orange.

Junior forward Asia Logan, who leads
Pitt in points, rebounds,a.nd blocks per
game, has recently struggled to find her
stroke. Logan shot just 3-for—12 from the

field at Syracuse off the bench, and the
Panthers’ key player remains hobbled
by a nagging right shoulder injury and a
bothersome knee.

The one constant in the Pitt starting
lineup all season has been sophomore
guard Brianna Kiesel. Currently ranked
fourth in the Big East at 36 minutes per
game, the Panthers will need their “coach
on the court” —— as Berenato often refers
to Kiesel — to lead Pitt to victory against
the Bearcats, both mentally and with her
scoring touch.

TASSER’S TAKE

Penguins could be poised to make Stanley Cup run‘

Donnie Tasser
) Stcﬁ’ Wrz'ter

}_E‘ollowing back—to-back losses to the New
Jersey Devils, the Pittsburgh Penguins
have reeled off three consecutive victo-
ries and currently sit atop the National
Hockey League’s Eastern Conference.

They are playing exactly the way ev-
eryone expected them to this season: with
stretches of up-tempo, exciting hockey
sandwiched between sloppy, unfocused,
penalty-mired play.

This may be a bit premature, but if the
Pens can tighten up thescrews a bit, we

could very well see Lord Stanley’s Cup’

back in the Steel City, and not a moment
too soon. After the Pirates’ momentous
collapse from the promised land of above-
.5oo—dom, the Steelers missing the play-
offs and that purple team that I think just
won a big game or something, Pittsburgh

is actively trying to forget this past year —

in sports. . T.

Maybe the Penguins will restore hope
to the gloomy lives of Pittsburgh sports
fans in the next few months. ‘

It’s impossible to bringpup the Pen-
guins’ chances of winn,iiIg._tlie Cup without
agrcacophony of dissentéirigaifvriices throw-
ing out. reasons why they’-can’t.

Sidney Crosby could get hurt. Marc-
Andre Fleury isn’t an elite goalie. They

take too many penalties. They don’t play '
defense. Team mascot Iceburgh is on ste- I

roids. You name it, and it has been used.

The one problem that I could see get-
ting in the Penguins’ way is the team’s
affinity to become unfocused for stretches
of time. They seem to enjoy indulging
other teams’ pests and taking unwar-
ranted penalties. "

Witness Sunday’s victory over the Buf-

falo Sabres: The Pens struck quickly, scor-
ing on their first two shots before relaxing
and retaliating against chirpy Sabres. The

result? ‘Buffalo stormed back to take a 3-2 A

lead before the Penguins rediscovered
their mojo and escaped with'a‘4—3 Win. '
If there’s one thing that last season’s
embarrassing playoff ﬁasco against the
Philadelphia Flyers taught us, it isthat
Pittsburgh might be the most emotional
team in the league, which isn’t a good
thing. The Flyers were able to knock the
Pens off their game, and the whole coun-
try watched the proverbial house of cards
come down. ‘
‘Do I think a similar scenario could
arise this season? It could, but I don’t
think it will. '

Last season’s playoff loss seems _to .

have shakensome sense into the team.
They have actually played a good deal
of defense this season, and Paul Martin

' looks vastly improved (which isn’t dif-

ficult, considering how terrible he was
last year). _ l ' ..  " ,
After a shaky start, Fleury is back to
playing well in goal and backup Tomas
Vokoun is making a case for a goalie con-
troversy, which is a good thirig——' Fleury
needed a fireglit under his butt atfgsome
point. _ _,  , V, __1  . 7
This Penguins team could getevei'1’bét-
ter once center Evgeni Malkin rediscovers
his goal—scor_ing touch and defenseman
Kris Letang isigfully healthy, which is scary

for the rest o§f;the N HL-.

Now I’m not coming right outand say-
ing that the Pens are going to be Stanley
Cup Champions —l not until the Chicago
Blackhawks lose a game in regulation,
anyway —— but provided the team learned

- a lesson from last season, they are going

to be very hard to beat come spring. I
Write Donnie at dft6@pitt.edu.

Pitt head coach Joejordano was impressed
with the starter’s outing on Friday.

“Ethan Mildren pitched very well and
settled down after the two -run homer in the

inning,” Jordano said.

Tanner Wilt, a sophomore reliever, picked

up the win after striking out the game’s ﬁnal

rs will try to cope out injured starting freshman point guard Britta

Gordon for the remainder of the season. Huailel Wang | For The Pitt News

the guard that only managed to shoot
1-for-9 from the field onﬂsaturday will
not be a good sign for Pitt. She leads the
team in scoring and rebounding during
conference play, but her leadership on
the court may be the thing the Panthers
need most on Wednesday.

Kiesel will also be faced with the task
on defense of covering Cincinnati red-
shirt junior guard Dayeesha Hollins,
the Bearcats’ only player who averages
double ﬁgures. A transfer student from
the University of Michigan, Hollins ex-
celled’ in her first season as a Bearcat last
year, earning All-Big East Second-Team
honors while averaging almost 15 points
per game. A

Keeping Hollins and the rest of the
Bearcats off the scoreboard as much as

possible may be the key to Pitt ending its
long conference losing streak.

‘The five Panthers that take the Pe-
tersen Events Center ﬂoor on Wednesday
will be matched up against the Big East’s
worst-scoring offense, with Cincinnati

only managing to score 52 points per

game in conference ‘play.

The responsibility of consistent post
play on the defensive side of the ball, es-
pecially preventing easy buckets around
the basket, will fall on Pitt sophomore
centers Cora McManus and Chyna Golden
and freshman forward Krista Pettepier.

If those three can have success, along
with Kiesel and Davis in the backcourt,
then the_Panthers may find themselves
celebrating an unfamiliar winning feeling
late Wednesday night. I

ofSaturday’s triumph. “offensively, we swung

the bats well again but left a ton of runners in.

scoring position. We need to keep grinding
and playing hard.”

Part of that tenacious play includes ﬁnish-
ing out games.

The Panthers nearly relinquished a big
lead when Wichita State scored a pair of runs
in the seventh inning and three runs in the

ei-ghth, narrowing the gap to 9-7. In the bot—* a

tom of the ninth -— after Roche’s run-scoring
ﬁelder’s choice in the top half of the inning —

the ﬁrst three Shockers reached base, one of I
them scoring an eighth run for the home side. '

Wilt entered the game and immediately
induced a sharp lineout to senior shortstop
Evan Oswald, who threw to ﬁrst to double up
the Wichita State baserunner. After the next
batter grounded out to second, Wilt recorded

T his ﬁrst save of the season and ensured a Pitt

series victory.
 Pitt’s starting pitcher, junior righty Matt

Wotherspoon, picked up the win despite ale‘

lowing six earnedruns and 11 hits in 7 1/3
inningspitched.

Pitt 11, Witchita State 3

Sunday’s starting pitcher, Pitt junior Rhys
Aldenhoven, was more effective, throwing 6
1/3 innings and surrendering four hits and no
walks. The right-handed Aldenhoven allowed
just two runs — one earned — and struck
out three en route to his ﬁrst win.

The Panthers staked an early six—run
lead against Wichita State’s redshirt junior
starter, right-hander Tobin Mateychick. With
Pitt already leading by two, sophomore ﬁrst
baseman Eric Hess launched a grand slam
to deep right ﬁeld, a blast that would chase
Mateychick from the game after he retired
just one batter.

In the second inning, Roche piled on to
the torrent start with his second home run
of the series. He ﬁnished the weekend with a

robust .571 average and seven runs batted in. ‘

“Obviously that’s a tough place to play,”
said Roche, who was named Big East Player
of the Week following his impressive open-
ing series. “It’s great for us to go in a hostile
environment and sweep a team with that
kind of track recor .”

Pitt added four more runs and suppressed
a dejected Shockers’ offense, completing the
series sweep with a resounding 11-3 victory.

Coach Jordano was pleased with Pitt’s

  

weekend, but he remained humble knowing
an arduous schedule full of tough opponents
remains.
“We played very well as a team this week-
end,” he said. “For us to sweep such a storied
’ program as Wichita State is a great accom-
plishment, but I know this team is looking
forward to getting back to practice on Tues-
day and preparing for our next opportunity.”
Roche echoed his coach’s statement.
“Once we get back [to Pitt] , it’s back to
business and time tolfocus on the next game,”
he. said. - j I  A ‘ ,_
