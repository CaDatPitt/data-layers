By Jonathan Berr

The Pittsburgh Student Net-
work is launching a letter-writing
campaign to stop funding for the
Contras. They also are planning
to attend an anti-Contra rally this
Friday at the Federal Building in
downtown Pittsburgh.

Todd May of the Thomas Mer-
ton Center is one of the organiz-
ers of the rally and an adviser to
PSN. ‘

May said, ”We are not going to
have many political big shots at
the rally. It's going to focus main-

to be known as Friday Night
Live at the Concourse.

This Friday is ”reggae night”
at the Concourse, with the

Naro announced a tentative
schedule for performers at the
Concourse, including The
Clarks and Beauty Constant,
Feb. 12; Johnny Rhythm and
the Dimestore 45's, Feb. 26;
Jazz Discovery, March 18; and
an as-yet unnamed band led
by Steve Morrison, formerly of

a ”minority band.”

The University of Pittsburgh
has announced, regretfully, the
death of Dr. Robert C. Hickey.
He was chairman of Pitt's Bicen-
tennial Committee.

Those interested in paying their
respects may call at Laughlins
Funeral Home, 222 Washington
Rd., Mt. Lebanon on Tuesday and

9Wednesday 2-4 p.m. and 7-9

p.m. A burial mass will be held
on Thursday morning at St.
Winifred Church at 11:00 a.m.

Hickey had said at the time of

" Dr. Robert Hickey dies

the Bicentennial, ”The bicenten-
nial is not an occasion for the
conspicuous consumption of
resources, but it is an investment
for life in the future.”

We thank Dr. Hickey for his
contributions to the University of
Pittsburgh, for his investment in
all of our futures, as we are-sure
his deeds will benefit many to
come. It is people like Hickey
who have helped maintain the
high standards of this university.

English bill meets opposition  

By Pete Fleming
Staff Writer

Currently, there is legislation
under consideration in Pennsyl-
vania that calls for English to be
the official language of the state.
If it were passed, all government
documents, public information
and other common things such as
the instructions of how to use a
public telephone would be
changed to just English.

The Pittsburgh Ethnic Coalition
sponsored a debate on Thursday,
Jan. 21, in the William Pitt Un-

, ion in which the implications of,
this bill were discussed. A mem-

ber of PEC opened the program
by saying that they are against the

Ashland Oil awards

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's
Center for Hazardous Materials
Research has been awarded a
$250,000 grant to study the ef-
fects of the recent diesel oil spill
in the Ohio and Monongahela
Rivers. E

The grant came from Ashland
Oil, Inc. According to CHMR’s
office manager, Sandra Ray-
mond, ”Ashland Oil picked
CHMR because of our reputation
and past performance record. We
have an interdisciplinary staff that
is internationally recognized. We
were looked at carefully.

”We are looking at the short-
and long-term effects of the oil

legislation because it not only dis-
criminates against the different
ethnic groups in communities,
but it also denies them their rights
as U.S. citizens.

The PEC alleged that making
English our official language
would keep English illiterates
from applying for jobs or finding
places to live.

Gary Rubin of the American

Jewish Committee said, ”The En- _

glish Only legislation is a racist
movement. When everyone gets
behind this, it will either unite us
or divide us.”

The PEC claims that the legis-
lation will threaten bilingual pro-
grams and services in education,

health care and religious and bus-_

spill. What is going to happen to
the ecosystem here a few years
down the line?” said Raymond.

”The spill was an incon-
venience to many residents, a lot
of whom panicked. They did not
know what the effects of the spill
would be,” said Raymond. '

CHMR is located at RIDC Park
in Harmarville. Their study of the
spill will focus on three main
areas.

First, they will attempt to help
the affected communities to un-
derstand the impact of the spill
more clearly.

Second, they will assess the
short- and long-term effects of the
spill. The impact on animal and
aquatic life will be addressed as

iness transactions for new ethnic
groups. According to the PEC,
this violates the rights and
privileges that are guaranteed by
the 14th Amendment of the Con-
stitution.

Similar legislation has been
passed in 17 other states but has
been defeated in 12 states. The
legislation is now pending in
Pennsylvania and in eight other
states.

”The issue is not the language;
the issue is literacy. This is a na-
tion of diversified cultures. Suc-
cessful civil rights movements
depend on cultural literacy,” said
5. Andrew Chen of the Organiza-
tion of Chinese Americans.

P°tt t
well as how the local population
is affected.

Thirdly, CHMR will collate and
analyze data about the spill. Find-
ings will be shared with similar
research groups in addition to
regulatory agencies.

Also participating in the oil spill
research is the Netherlands Or-
ganization for Applied Scientific
Research, which was active in the
Rhine River toxic chemical spill
of 1986. An agreement between
TNO and CHMR will streamline
the transference of data between
the two groups.

Anyone with questions regard-
ing the oil spill should call
CHMR’s hot-line number at
(800.)334-CHMR.

Schultz claims Soviets are cheating on treaty

WASHINGTON —— Secretary of
State George P. Shultz assured
conservative critics Monday the
United States will respond
vigorously if the Soviet Union
violates the new arms reduction
treaty in Europe, but Sen. Jesse
Helms declared the Soviet Union
already is exploiting an ”en-
graved invitation to cheat.”

As Shultz led off the adminis-
tration's campaign for Senate
ratification of the treaty, Helms,
R—N.C., waving a document
marked ”TOP SECRET" in bright
red, contended he had obtained
classified information proving the
Soviets already have violated the
pact which calls for the elimina-
tion of medium- and shorter-
range nuclear missiles.

Helms, an outspoken conserva-
tive, told the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee he had
received confirmation of the
document's authenticity from CIA
Director William Webster.

Shultz declined to discuss or
even look at the document on
grounds he was surrounded by
photographers and television
cameramen.

Cocaine dealers

declare ‘total war’

BOGOTA, Colombia -— Gun-
men ambushed and kidnapped
the country's chief prosecutor on
Monday, killing his two
bodyguards and apparently
wounding him.

The government blamed the
abduction on the Medellin Car-
tel, which U.S. officials said con-
trols 80 percent of the cocaine
entering the United States.

About four hours after the ab-
duction of Prosecutor General
Carlos Mauro Hoyos, police
searching the hills around Medel-
lin stumbled on and freed a
Bogota mayoral candidate whom
traffickers had kidnapped a week
ago.

Hoyos, 45, was seized about
7:20 a.m. while nearing the
Medellin airport for a flight to the
capital about 200 miles to the
southeast. At least a half—dozen
men in three jeeps and a car ran
his Mercedes-Benz into a curb
and sprayed it with submachine
gun fire, witnesses said.

On Sunday, traffickers an-

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

nounced ”total war” on officials
who try to extradite them to the
United States to face criminal
charges.

In the past four years, cartel
members have waged a bloody
war against efforts to prosecute
them. Murder victims have in-
cluded journalists, a justice
minister and 21 judges handling
drug cases.

Hoyos, who investigates
wrongdoing in the government
and judiciary, had —-just spent a
week in Medellin investigating
last month's release from prison
of reputed cocaine baron Jorge
Luis Ochoa Vasquez.

The United States has been try-
ing to extradite Ochoa, who it
says is second-in-command of the
Medellin Cartel.

Police found one of Hoyos’
shoes and his blood-splattered
coat in the Mercedes along with
the bodies of his driver and other
bodyguard, who were together

hit by at least 19 bullets, officials
said.

Nation's report card

shows testing error

WASHINGTON -— A
government-backed testing agen-
cy delayed release of 1986
reading-exam results because
scores among 9- and I 7-year-olds
dropped sharply; and embar-
rassed officials suspect testing
procedures, not students’ reading
abilities, may have slumped.

The drop was in the reading
portion of the National Assess-
ment of Educational Progress, an
exam given to 70,000 students
ages 9, I3 and 17 selected to
represent their entire age group.
Scores for 13-year-olds did not
fall.

”We have, it's embarrassing to
say, a real mysteryghere. We
haven't come up with any ideas
that solve the problem,” Archie
E. Lapointe, executive director of
the testing program, said Monday
in a telephone interview from ETS
headquarters.

Lapointe called it ”an incredi-
ble, unbelievable loss,’’ and said

data.”

Chester E. Finn Jr., the educa-
tion department’s assistant secre-
tary for educational research and
improvement, said: ”It’s a com-
bination of a disappointment and
a mystery.  It's either a glitch in
the NAEP instrument or a glitch
in American reading.”

Both the service and the depart-
ment have convened panels as;
experts to review the problerfi
and recommend ways to avoid a
recurrence.

The reviewers at ETS consi-
dered — but discounted -- a
wide range of possibilities that
could have skewed the results, in-
cluding the fact that some young-
sters took the exam on Jan. 28,
I986, the day the Challenger
space shuttle blew up.

”There was some minor drop
of 9-year-olds that afternoon, but
nothing that would explain the
significance of what we found,”
Lapointe said.

,Motives of NFL: Are
they really sincere?

With Panther running back Craig Heyward now leaving col-
legiate football for a chance to play in the National Football
League, Pitt fans and the general public alike may question his
motives.

Although he may be passing up his chance to finish his edu-
cation, the whole purpose of college is to prepare an individu-
al for one’s career.

If Heyward came to college so he could play pro football,
then he should be able to carry out his dream. If someone wants
to become a doctor or lawyer, then they take the necessary steps
to become one.

You can't blame a man for wanting to provide for his family,

both his parents and his child. If Heyward wants to care for
them now, then by all means, he should.
/ People may say he's trying to dance around the rules, that
he went the minimum distance instead‘ of riding out his edu-
cation. The problem doesn’t lie with the players, but moreso
with the organization. '

Sports agents lure players with rewardsand promises. When
an agent spots a quality player, his only concern is how much
he can make off the player should this athlete become success-
ful. It's -his own well—being he is concerned about, not some-
one else’s.

The NFL has also tarnished college football. The newly-
formed supplemental draft allows players who are ineligible
for the regular draft to make their way into the league. This goes
against the NFL’s self-imposed rule that they will not take any
underclassmen.

Heyward is just a another victim in the exploited state of col-
lege football.

In a nutshell 
It

There's nothing wrong with whimsy.
Too many people mistake misery for art.

A head of steel, aheart of gold

Maybe it's just me again. I think
the steel plate in my head absorbs
too much cold in the winter and
does a number on my cortex.

Maybe it's not me.

A few times a day, I brave my
way through the Towers lobby;
sometimes, I eat lunch down-
stairs. I've been noticing some-
thing that irritates me. No one
looks where they're going.

Now that I think about ‘it, no
one looks where anyone else is
going either. I lead a quiet and
simple life. I never go out of my
way to give someone a hard time.
I try not to stereotype. I wouldn't
steal your kid sister's last nickel.

When I walk in public, I try to
pick a path that does not include
stepping on your toes, elbowing
your books into oncoming traffic,
or shouting through your ears to
someone across of the street.

I also do not smoke tobacco,
and if I did, I'd be courteous
enough not toexhale so as to get
every penny's worth out of my
wretched but touching addiction.

Why does the Towers lobby
resemble Brunch of the Living
Dead? Why are there so many ill-
mannered sluggards stumbling
around without order, in total
chaos? Did something go amiss
with their toilet training?

MARK
BROWN

Seriously, take a few minutes
out of your schedule and observe
traffic patterns in the Towers lob-
by. Small cliques of self—assured
pre—yuppies (puppies? poopies?)
bump into each other with
aplomb and a total lack of regard
for the poor kid trying to get out
of the way of their human wave.
Are these people joined at the
waist?

I remember seeing a slightly ;

animated version of Tolkien’s
Lord of the Rings, which includ-
ed a wave of charging Orcs. Why
do I equate this with trying to get
a copy of this paper in the lobby
without getting pushed out of the
revolving doors?

Downstairs in the cafeteria, it's
a no—man’s land. Sorry, ladies. No
person's land. Trying to get
through the lunch tables with my
Bluto-like tray of food means
dodging two sororities, the varsi-
ty groupies and half of the class
of '91. That's why I put a pound
of yogurt on the front of my tray
next to my pigeon tetrazzini, so
be warned: trip me up and you're
wearing it.

I know it's not just me imagin-
ing this. Others have noticed
coeds scrambling to avoid a rack
of trays being pushed around
blindly. ‘How can one miss some
schmo executing a left turn into
a wall of undergrads while the
person looks to the right. Expres-
sions such as, ”Excuse me," or r”I
beg your pardon" a_re rarely
heard.

And it's not just there. Go up
to Scaife Cafeteria and dodge the‘
doctors. They're even cockier
and more insensitive than your
average undergrad, due to the
lofty status that quacks receive in
this country, and are convinced
that they can do no wrong.‘ So
when they smash their trays into
you, just curtsey andbegtheir
forgiveness, humbly. '

Just a suggestion, remember
how someone gave you a hint
that vehicular traffic is negotiat-
ed by keeping in the right hand
lane? Maybe if we kind of admit-
ted that we're not the only peo-
ple in the world and that
someone else might just try to be

walking within a few feet of us, .

then if we sort of bear to the right
in something vaguely resembling
order, we have transcended the
human wave as a mode of
transport.

Starving is nolaughing matter

So, KDKA is sorry if anyone
was offended, but the station real-
ly doesn't understand what all the
fuss is about. At the University of
Pittsburgh (an institution of higher
learning), the managing editor of
the school's newspaper can't un-
derstand why African-Americans
aren't laughing either.

At Pitt, the joke was about the
National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Cats and Pigeons.
Something must be wrong with
us because we can't find the hu-
mor in Mike Levine's suggestion
that we send dead,.frozen cats to
feed the world's starving poor.

Well, hey, I like a good joke as
much as anyone. If this isthe path
humor is taking, I want to join in.
I say we call the city's animal
control department (purely as a

joke, this is all very funny) and

 

  LETTERS

suggest that all dead animals be
collected, processed, frozen and
sent to Appalachia. After all,
Mike Levine wanted to feed the
world's starving. Bill Burns sin-
gled out Africa without thinking
of the colorless, less publicized
face of hunger. We could send
the collected dead cats to Africa,
dead pigeons to Appalachia and
send the dead dogs to Poland to
help relieve the ti'resome bread
lines. _

This is so amusing! Can't you
just imagine their hungry faces
when they open those packages
from the rich United States and
see dead cats, pigeons and dogs?
The starving will no doubt have
a moment of hilarity before they

succumb. They'll probably laugh.

heartily and remark on our
”American ingenuity." Patti
Burns will be enlisted to travel
around the world recording this
international practical joke. The
resultant film could be used to
help ease the tensions now brew-
ing in the United Nations. I'm
finding this all so funny that I
have tears in my eyes.

In fact, however, world hunger I

is never a joke. World hunger is
nothing to make light of. Those
of us who can find humor in the
misery of others, no matter what
their color, should remember that
Jesus knocked at the back door
dressed as a beggar. Some of you
jokers tossed him a dead cat. No
doubt he laughed but knew. "As
you give so shall you receive.”

ready visited Nicaragua.”
PSN president Angie Hirsch
said, ”We gave a hundred mil-
lion dollars to the contras and

only one million to AIDST

research.”

According to one of the found-
ers of PSN, Bill Frizlen, the group
uses the leftist student organiza-
tion of the T9605, Students for a
Democratic Society, as its role
model.

Hirsch Said her organization
will attempt to tie together many
single-issue groups into an um-
brella organization.

’’There isn’ta whole lot of uni-
ty among these groups,” said
Hirsch.

According to Vicki Zeitner, a
senior political science major
from Bethlehem, Pa., there are
many students who are con-
cerned about social justice issues

but don't know what they can 
to change things.

Zeitner said, ”They don't know
how powerful they are.”

PSN is a part of a new wave of
leftist student movements that are
forming across the country. This
movement started last January at
Hampshire College in Vermont.
In February, they are holding a’
National Student Conference at
Rutgers University of leftist stu-
dent groups Iike the PSN. 07‘

The National Student Confer-
ence has veterans of the T9605
such as Barry Commmoner and
Abbie Hoffman on its advisory
board.

Hoffman said that he doesn't
consider himself an activist. ”Ac-
tivists go to meetings. I am an or-
ganizer,” he stated.

Hoffman said that he thinks it
is important for college students
to become politically active.

Lane shatters Friars’
prayers as Panthers
roll to easy 90-56 win

By Tom Danyluk
Staff Writer

After last Saturday's game
against the Pitt Panthers, Oklaho—
ma center Harvey Grant said, ’’I
didn't know how strong Jerome
Lane was. Now I do.”

Then again, maybe he didn't.

Panther forward Jerome Lane
executed a Fitzgerald first last
night in Pitt's 90—56 smashing of
the Providence Friars. Lane
tossed in 17 points, pulled down
17 rebounds and a backboard.

Yes, a backboard.

Ahead 6-5 early in the first half,
Panther point guard Sean Miller
was at halfcourt directing the Pitt
fastbreak. Alone in the right lane
was Lane, with only Providence
guard Carlton Screen to beat to
the basket.

Miller fed Lane the ball. He
took two steps and soared to the
basket with his patented one-
handed tomahawk dunk cocked
and ready to fire.

The undersized Screen wasn't
about to challenge the powerful
Lane for the rights to the hoop,
and the ball went through clean-

ly enough.

Not a soul in sold—out Fitzger-
ald knew that the university had
installed collapsable backboards.
Collapsable rims, yes. Back-
boards, no.

Lane decided to give the crowd
a first-hand demonstration.

The backboard spider—webbed,
and the rim was ripped off its
hinges. Screen was showered
with falling glass. Lane was sho-
wered with high—fives.

’’It was unbelievable, like a
dream,” said Lane. ’’I couldn't

believe that it happened. I was‘

just gonna slam it as hard as I
could to fire up the crowd. When
it happened I just said, ‘Yeah.’

’’I was pumped up after l,did
it. I could have broken three
more.”

”That was the wildest thing I've
ever seen, especially being on the
court when it happened,” mar-
velled Pitt center Charles Smith.
’’But I think Jerome was more sur-
prised than anyone.”

Panther head coach Paul Evans
was shocked. ’’It was unbelieva-
ble. I've never been at a pro game

Heyward leaves Pitt
to seek fortunes of
pro football career

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Pitt Panther running back Craig
”lronhead” Heyward has decid-
ed to forgo his final year of col-
lege eligibility and will turn his
sights toward the NFL.

Heyward, who hours earlier
failed to appear at a press confer-
ence held by head coach Mike
Gottfried, told WPXI-TV that he
will ”petition the NFL” so he can
enter the supplemental draft.

He cannot enter the regular
NFL draft in April since he has
college eligibility relmainig and
has not graduated‘.

”My reasons for [leaving] are
being a father and coming from
a family of eight,” said Heyward,
the 6-foot, 280 pounder from Pas-
saic N.J. ’’I think the decision I'm
going to make is the decision for
me.”

In reference to how Gottfried
would react to the situation, Hey-
ward remarked that his coach's
decision ”was to persuade me to
come back and to finish, the
educational part of it. I had my
mind made up I wanted to turn
pro and he had a somewhat hesi-
tant reaction to it.”-

’’I can't say I'm surprised, but
l am disappointed,” said
Gottfried.

Gottfried said earlier that he
wished Heyward would consider
finishing his education before
making any kind of decision to
leave Pitt.

”l encouraged him to keep the
idea of education...and degree
alive,” said Gottfried. ”l ex-
plained to him about [former Pan-
ther running back] Charles
Gladman,...what was probably
going through his mind. I talked
to him about how [sports agent
Bruce] Allen and [Eric] Metz can
pump you full of things.

”The most important thing for
him right now is to sit down and
grasp the whole situation,” Gott-
fried added.

Allen, along with his father,

George, a former NFL coach, are,

the owners of GBA Sportsworld.
Metz, a local insurance salesman
who works for Allen, was thrown
out of the Panther locker room
last spring when spotted by
Gottfried.

’’I didn't know he was going to '

do it," said Gottfried, referring to
Heyward. ”He’s got his mind
made up and is acting on advice
from someone else.

”He’s got another year yet and
could enhance his chances by
staying in school, but he's got
[agents] blowing things in his ear
and I don't know what they're
telling him.”

Gottfried has had a history of
lashing out at agents, dating back
to the Gladman—Teryl Austin in-
cident when both were involved
with agents.

Austin accepted payment from
agents Norby Walters and Lloyd
Bloom, but repaid the agents and

Heyward

 

Continued from page 7
regained most of his senior eligi-
bility, sitting out the team's first
two games.

Austin's seven interceptions as
a sophomore in 1985 placed him
fifth in the nation, and caught the
eyes of the agents.

Gladman, who rushed for
1,085 yards as a sophomore in
1985, refused to cooperate with
an NCAA investigation, thus for-
feiting his eligibility.

He was not taken in the sup-
plemental draft, but worked his
way onto the NFL’s Tampa Bay
Buccaneers as a replacement
player during the strike. Once the
regular players returned,
however, Gladman was released.

At yesterday's conference,
Gottfried stated that agents ”stalk
players like vultures and prey on
their innocence. All these agents
are leeches and bloodsuckers

who sell out the long-term advan-
tages of an education for the
short-term gains of quick money.

’’Just as soon as they’re done
with the kids, they get rid of
them. lt’s a known fact,” said
Gottfried.

Heyward, who finished fifth in
the Heisman Trophy balloting
and was considered the frontrun-
ner for next year's award, rushed
for 1,655 yards this season. He
was the second—leading rusher in
the country and rushed for 100
yards in all 12 games last season,
making him only the eighth col-
legiate player to do so.

It is assumed Heyward will be

drafted high in the first round, es-

pecially since there is a lack of
players at the skilled positions.

The Pitt men's track team
traveled to Johnson City, Tenn.,
this past Saturday to participate in
the Eastman Kodak Invitational.

The event boasted a strong

from the East, virtually all the
teams from the Southern, Atlan-

ferences as well as several teams
from Southwest Conference par-

Pitt coach John Vasvary was in
’a positive frame of mind upon the
team's return. ”We had a real
good meet. It was an important
meet in that it is an important
prelude to the NCAA champion-

Lady Panthers defeat 

'9

Cleveland State, 75-62

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt women's basketball head
coach Kirk Bruce started the sea-
son with the idea that his team
would be a fast—breaking, pres-
sure defense—oriented squad.

But most teams the Lady Pan-
thers have faced have outrun Pitt,

_calling for the Panther five to play

catchup. Not so last night.

The Lady Panthers hounded
the Vikings of Cleveland State,
forcing them into 29 turnovers en
route to a 75-62 non-conference
victory before a crowd of 248 at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Vikings looked more like

the game, using a pressure
defense to force the Lady Pan-
thers into 16 turnovers and nine
personal fouls in the first half.
But the undersized Cleveland
State defense was the only thing
that kept the Vikings in the game.
Pitt led 36-34 at intermission.
When the second half got un-
derway, the Lady Panthers Came
out running. They went on a 10-4
scoring run, including six points
by Pitt forward Lorri Johnson.
The Vikings got no closer than
six points in the secondihalf as
Pitt shot an amazing 67 percent
from the field.
Johnson was again the big gun
for the Lady Panthers, scoring 16

Freshman Debra Taylor netted 17
points, while Terri Miller and An-
nette_Powers scored 12 apiece.

But the biggest figure to come
out of the lineup was that of Pitt's

6-foot-4 freshman center Connie

Hurt. _Cleveland State’s Jennifer
Smith and Hurt became entan-
gled under the Panthers basket
midway throught the second half,
and both came up swinging with
enough ferocity to make Mike Ty-
son jealous. Technicals and game
disqualifications were issued to
both players.

The Lady Panthers have won
two games in a row after a record
seven-game losing streak, and
stand at 8-9 overall and 1-6 in the
Big East. Cleveland State's record
is 5-12.

Washington and Denver try to
buck the odds in Super Bowl

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

For the first time in three ap-
pearances, the Denver Broncos
have been established by odds-
makers as the favorite to win the
Super Bowl. _

The Broncos, 10-4-1 during the
regular season, are favored by 3‘/2
points over the Washington Red-
skins in Super Bowl XXII, which
will be played this Sunday in San
Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium.

The Broncos are 0-2 in Super
Bowl play, while the Redskins are

1-2.

The Broncos are the first AFC
team to make back-to-back Super
Bowl appearances since the Pitts-
burgh Steelers in Super Bowl XIII
and XIV.

Denver was the underdog in its
first Super Bowl appearance, Su-
per Bowl XII against the Dallas
Cowboys, and lost 27-10. Red
Miller was the head coach of the
Broncos then, while the present
Denver coach, Dan Reeves, was
an assistant with Dallas under
Tom Landry.

Last year,

Reeves’ Broncos .

reached Super Bowl XXI as
11-point underdogs and ended
up losing 39-20 to the New York
Giants.

On the other side of the field,
the Washington Redskins, 11-4 in
the regular season, have a much
more interesting scenario when it
comes to point spreads in the Su-
per Bowl. Each time the Redskins
have appeared in a Super Bowl,
the point-spread underdog has
won the game.

In Super Bowl VII, George Al-
len's Redskins were favored by

or anywhere else where I've seen
that happen.

”Darelle Porter said it best in
the lockerroom. He said, ‘Jerome,
coach told you he wants you to
go in tougher to the basket.’ Well,

tougher than that.”

After a 35-minute delay, the
shattered backboard was
wheeled off, the glass splinters
were swept away, and then so
were the Friars. _

Pitt bolted out to a 39-28 hal-
ftime lead, then ripped off the first

nine points of the second half to
take a 48-28 lead.

Providence never got closer
than 17 the rest of the way.

”Pittsburgh played a great
game,” remarked Friar head
coach Gordon Chiesa. ”They
have very good talent. I've never
seen them play better than they
did in the second half.”

Smith finished with 17 points
and 8 rebounds. Panther forward
Bobby Martin tossed in 15, with
11 of those points coming from
the free-throw line.

Guard Jason Matthews added
14 points.

Center Steve Wright led Provi-
dence with 14 points.

The win improved Pitt's record
to 14-2, 4-1 in the Big East. The
Friars fell to 8-8, 2-4.

Evans wasn't sure how his team
would react after its disappoint-
ing 86-83 loss to the Sooners in
Norman. He had to be pleased
with the effort.

”Our team is great after a loss,”
said Lane. ”The loss helped a lot.
It helped us key on what we were
doing wrong.”

’’I figured we would come out
tough," said forward Demetreus
Gore, who chipped in 13 points
of his own. ”It was a tough loss
[to Oklahoma]. But we shot real-
ly well [last night]. I think anyone
who played us would have had
a_ tough time.” _

The Panthers started slowly, as
Providence’s full-court pressure
and methodical tempo kept Pitt's
explosive offense under wraps. At

the 15:45 mark of the first half,

Pitt's offensive output consisted
of a Matthews jumper and four
free throws. Chiesa had the Pan-

' thers playing his game.

Then Lane broke the ice. _

”We got the momentum back
after the rim was broken,” he
said. ”They had the momentum
before that. It's one of those fan-
tasies you chalk up, then on to
the next one.”

When Lane was asked about
the next one he replied, ”Getting
thirty rebounds.” '

After last night, anything is
possible.

Pens lose to Oilers as Hannan
scores three on former team

(AP) — Dave Hannan scored
three goals in the first period and
the Edmonton Oilers ended Pitts-
burgh's four-game winning streak
with a 6-4 victory over the Pen-
guins on Monday night.

Hannan, who played his entire
career with the Penguins until he
was part of the Nov. 24 Paul
Coffey trade, registered his first
three-goal hat trick in his 313th
NHL game-

Esa Tikkanen put Edmonton
ahead to stay when he broke a
3-3 tie with a power-play goal at
10:07 of the second period, put-
ting a rebound past goalie Frank
Pietrangelo for his 14th goal of
the season. Charlie Huddy made
it 5-3 at 12:36 with a shot from
the left point.

Rob Brown tipped in Coffey’s
shot with one second left in the
second period to bring the Pen-
guins within one goal but Edmon-
ton's Marty McSor|ey closed out
the scoring 18 seconds into the
third period.

Pittsburgh scored twice before
the Oilers had a shot onﬁgoal.

Dave Mcllwain scored just 35 se-
conds into the game and Dan
Quinn added a power-play tally
at 4:16.

Hannan then scored two goals
28 seconds apart, converting
McSorley’s pass at 7:54 and then
snapping a low shot past
Pietrangelo from 20 feet at 8:22
to tie the game.

Coffey, playing his first game
against Edmonton, blasted a slap-
shot past goalie Grant Fuhr at
16:37 to give the Penguins a 3-2
lead but Hannan completed his
hat trick, scoring a short-handed
goal with 11 seconds left in the
first period. His backhand shot
followed a 2—on-1 with Mike
Krushelnyski.

Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky
missed his 13th consecutive
game with a knee injury. The Oil-
ers are 5-4-4 in his absence and
were 0-3-1 before defeating
Pittsburgh. .

’ The setback prevented the Pen-
guins from climbing into a
second-place tie in the Patrick Di-
vision. They remained two points

A one point over the Miami Dol-

phins. Miami won the defensive
struggle 14-7.

In Super Bowl XVII, the Dol-
phins were established as
3‘/2-point‘ favorites over
thensecond-year head coach Joe
Gibbs’ Redskin team. But, behind
the strength of John Riggins’_144
rushing yards, the ’Skins
prevailed 27-17.

The following year, in Super
Bowl XVIII, Washington entered
the contest favored by three over
the Los Angeles Raiders. The
Raiders, however, won convinc-
ingly, 38-9:

Overall, eight point-spread un-
derdogs have captured Super
Bowl trophies. The most drastic
upset came in 1969 when the

AFL New York Jets, 18-point un- .

derdogs to the NFL Baltimore
Colts, shocked the football world

by winning Super Bowl III, 16-7.,
