New Program
Council Draws

e Criticism

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The newly organized Pitt Union
Programming Council (PUPC) hit
its ﬁrst snag yesterday as two
student organizations complained
to the Student Government Board
of programming conﬂicts resulting
from the Council's takeover of
various campus programs.

The SGB reviewed the budgets
of the student governing organized
at Pitt.

Representatives from the Black
Action Society (BAS) and the
Resident Student Association

'{RSA) reported that programs

normally produced and promoted
by their organizations were being
cut from their budgets by the
allocations committee because of
the PUPC’s involvement in similar
programs.

The PUPC was organized by the
SGB and the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities last term in an attempt to
centralize campus programming.

Lack Of Aid May Assure Annual Tuition Hikes   Posvar

‘ By TOM KUKUl""T'A “ Their

- Pitt NewsStaffWriter
Pitt students could face the
prospect of annual tuition hikes if
the present level of state funding
continues, according to Chancellor

‘ Posvar.

“I’m afraid that unless the state
reverses its policy—that is, decides
to give us enough money to cover
inflation—we will be required to
raise tuition levels,” Posvar told
The Pitt News in an interview
Friday.

“The salaries of our faculty are
going up and the cost of goods and
services is also rising to cover
'nﬂation,” Posvar said. “While we

, “exceeded inﬂation this past
year, tuition over the past ﬁve or six
years has not gone up as rapidly as

. other expenses—that is because we

have tried as hard as we could to
keep tuition down.”

The Board of Trustees enacted a
$25 tuition hike at their annual
meeting last week in Johnstown in
addition to a $50 hike approved last
February. Posvar had stated earlier

till mi_d-July on the Student Union porch.

at a Senate Council meeting that

hike would not be considered
because of the uncertainty over
passage of the state budget in
Harrisburg and Pitt’s subsequent
four percent increase in appropria-
tions.

“We have the budget-audit
committee (of the Board) consider
the budget every year prior to the
annual meeting,” Posvar said.
“We had considered delaying this
year but decided to go ahead and
review the budget. While there was
uncertainty (over the Harrisburg
situation) there was less uncertainty
than last year. We are almost
certain to get our budget passed-
that is very, very likely.”

Posvar expressed confidence that
the Legislature would grant Pitt the
entire four percent increase pro-
posed by the House earlier this
year.

The Chancellor indicated that
tuition hikes at Penn State
and Temple may also be passed this
year.

coming up in a week or two,” he
said. “Temple representatives have
told me that- they are definitely
planning to raise tuition. Their
tuition is already higher than ours.
Penn State has not yet decided-
they raised their tuition last term. ”

In Posvar’s budget presentation
to the General Assembly last march
he indicated that a lack of state
funds and subsequent tuition hikes
are felt mainly by lower-middle
class families. Studies have shown
that from 1972 to 1977 Pitt has
experienced an 18 percent decline
in the proportion of freshmen
families in the $10,000 to $15,000
income range.

‘ ‘There has been some shift of the
lower income students into the
community colleges instead of
coming here,” Posvar stated.
“I want to see Pitt retain its share of
the middle and lower-middle class
students.

Posvar summarized his views of

Pitt Lobbyist
* Elected To
Committee

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Jeffrey Miller, member of Pitt’s
student lobby, was elected to the
Democratic State Committee last
Tuesday, ﬁnishing second in .the
democratic party vote with 2,772
votes.

“Actually, it was the ballot
position more than anything,” said
Miller who drew first ballot
position. “By the time people get"
down that low on the ballot, they’ll
just vote for the ﬁrst name. It’s sort
of the last rung on the voting
ladder—people treat it as such.”

Miller, a junior who will
represent Butler County, said the
label “student” was quite detri-

P mental, but added that he would
have no problems satisfying double
requirements as a politician and
student.

 

“People don’t understand what
my position entails,” he said. “All
I have to do is hold biyearly

Pitt News Staff Writer

A group of children quietly play in a brightly
decorated room fittingly labeled the “Kids
Corner. ” At ﬁrst glance these children appear
no different than any others—but they have
fallen victim to such mental illnesses as chronic
depression, self imposed isolation and various
forms of phobias. They, along with hundreds
of other Pittsburgh children, account for more
than 12,000 visits to the Pittsburgh Child
Guidance Center each year in search of help in
solving their emotional problems.

The Center, an academic affiliate of Pitt
since 1955, has recently agreed to a joint
contract with the University and Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC) to pool
all resources in the ﬁeld of child psychiatry,
effective July 1. .

if “This total afﬁliation is something I have

been pushing for since I began here 11 years
ago,” said Dr. Richard L. Cohen, director of
the Center and of WPIC’s child psychiatry unit.
“We’ve needed this meshing of governing
bodiesgand now for the ﬁrst time we have the
integration in all areas instead of just the top,’ ’

Founded in 1928 by an Oakland citizens
group, The Center has a staff of approximately
80, including eight trained child psychologists
along with trainees in social work, child
development psycho-education and medicine.

‘ ‘We have a highly trained staff of specialists
here to deal with the diversity of children’s
problems,” Cohen said. “In many cases the
patients referred. to us are simple enough so
that they can be referred to other agencies in
the area.”

Cohen said the illnesses treated at the center
(strictly on an out-patient basis) range from

those that require a few weeks to a few months
treatment to those that require upwards of two
years to remedy.

“We have some children that come here
after a loss of a, parent or a serious illness that
they are having trouble coping with,’T Cohen
said. , “The most frequent problem is
school-related where the child might be failing,
and as a result isolates_ himself socially from
others, which tends to lead in a vicious circle to
other problems.”

Cohen said the most common cause of _
emotional disturbances in children is
attributed to a combination of forces within
their environments.

He said that in addition to treating children’s
problems, a series of ootmseling programs are
set up for the families of the patients.

Lack Of State Aid

the outgoing Shapp administration
and its affect on higher education.

“The Shapp administration has
permitted the relevant support for
higher education to decline over the
years,” Posvar said, “partly
because of reasons they could not
help. Th_é.f2i'c‘t'i‘s support did decline
and that is a sad reﬂection on a state
administration that claimed to have
liberal values.”

With the eventual election of a
western Pennsylvanian to the
Governor's mansion in November,
Posvar said Pitt’s future should
improve, especially since Democrat
Pete Flaherty and Republican Dick
Thornburgh both attended grad-
uate schools at Pitt.

Posvar said the student lobby
group at Pitt has helped in
achieving an increase in state
appropriations.

“I think that in this particular

Pitt Student

year it (the student lobby) did not
have as much visibility as it would
have had in other years and in the
future,” Posvar said.” But the fact
that the legislators added four
percent to our budget over the
Governor’s recommendation can be
traced in large part to the sympathy
the legislators felt toward our
studetns." '

Posvar said lack of a unified
support for Pitt by local representa-
tives and State Senators could be
explained by various political views
in the Pittsburgh region.’

“They (Western Pennsylvanian
legislators) are a very fragmented
group,” Posvar said. “It is not a
caucus that hands together and
votes. Allegheny County is not a
metropolitan region. You have
completely different political points
of view in these different sectors.

Hopefully that will gradually

(Unregistered lobbyists, like those

Miller, who plans a career in
politics, said he wanted the unpaid

PUPC Draws Criticism
From Governance Groups

(Continuedfrom Page 1)

A letter protesting the powers of
the PUPC was distributed to board
members by the programming
committee of the BAS.

“The Black Action Society’s
concert programming efforts have
been successful in the past,” the
letter reads. “Therefore, we can
see no need to go with a promoter
which has never been tried before.

“At present,” the letter adds,
“there have been no guidelines or
contract agreements set up be-
tween promoters and the program-
ming council to insure the quality
programming we ourselves can
give.”

RSA chairman Phil Cillo said the
PUPC was assuming control of a
number of “minor” programs from
student groups that should be
retained by the individual organiza-
tions.

“We feel it is wrong and will
only cause strife between our
group and the PUPC,” Cillo said.

Cillo cited the PUPC’s proposed
coffeehouse programming slated
for this fall. He said the RSA had
initiated and conducted coffee-
houses in the past and his

organization wished to continue.

RSA coffeehouses in the future.

“This (the coffeehouses) has
been ours and we would like to
keep it ours,” Cillo said. “Why is
this group coming in and doing
things that we are already
successful at?”

“We did not intend to take any
programs away from any other
student organizations,” SGB presi-
dent Josh Baylson said. “I think
the idea is for groups to work with
—but not have the PUPC run the
programs.”

Members of the allocations

committee said confusion resulted
when attempting to determine if
programs should receive funding
when similar programs are also
offered by the PUPC.

Baylson said careful analysis
should be taken in the allocations
process when scheduling events in
order to avoid duplicating program-
ming.

“You have to consider the nature
of the program when deciding on
whether to fund it or not,” he said.

Baylson added that because the
PUPC is new, problems will arise
that must be dealt with after more
experience is gained.

“There is no reference point,”
Balyson said. “It is all new.”

“It’s an ambiguous situation,”
SGB member Dave Hesidence said.
“The PUPC is just coming into
existence. We are learning as we
go along.”

“This is done as a bit of preventive medicine
even after the child has been pronounced
improved—-just as are the return visit that we
like the children to make from time to time,”
Cohen said.

Cohen added that no long-term statistics on
the effectiveness are available because there
has been no funding for suitable research
programs of 10 to 15 years.

Cohen said that the contract agreement
came about greatly because of the interest of
Dr. Thomas Detre, director and chairman of
WPIC.

“Without him I can’t really forsee a change
like this occurring,” Cohen said.

In the area of funding Cohen said the new
agreement will have very little impact on any
portion of the Center’s budget or payroll.

‘_‘We will continue to operate as we have in
the past, receiving the majority of our funding
from the Allegheny County Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Fund, the United Way,
Federal grants and patient fees, with some
portions of staff members salaries being paid
by the University,” Cohen said.

According to Cohen the revision of the '
_ afﬁliation pact should serve to make the Center

function more efficiently as a single unit for the
common purpose of dispensing psychiatric
help where needed.

NEWSBRIEFS

House Approves State Budget

HARRISBURG—Moving with surprising speed, the House
voted, 105-85, yesterday to pass a $5.46 billion state budget, just
hours after a conference committee had approved the spending
plan.

The budget, which was sent to the Senate for a vote today,
requires no new taxes, it does not cover completely the proposed 5.5
percent wage hike for 106,000 state employees that will cost at least
$35 million in the 1978-79 ﬁscal year.

Funds for state-related colleges and institution, which total about
$300 million, are not included in the spending package.
These non-preferred funds require separate action.

House leaders said the budgethas a $21 million surplus that _could
fund part of the wage hike. To make up the remaining $14 million,
the various state departments would have to cut their spending and
possibly consumer services.

With an election and campaigning coming up, House members
were in no mood to repeat the agonizing budget ﬁght that lasted
virtually all of last year. By comparison, the conference committee
did not even start work on last year’s budget until July. And the
budget was not passed until august.

An equally fast verdict is expected in the Senate. From the outset,
the House and Senate were not very far apart in the state budgets
each had wanted.

“With the House passing it as easily as it did, we’re optimistic in
the Senate,” said Roy Afﬂerbach, executive assistant to the Senate
majority leader.

Belgians Leave A Zaire, French Remain

KOLWEZI, Zaire—Belgian paratroopers boarded airplanes
yesterday and left this African city, its dusty streets strewn with
victims of last week’s rebel siege, in the hands of French and
Zairean soldiers after a 3‘/2-day evacuation of nearly 2,500 white
civilians.

The last unit of the estimated 1,200 to 1,500 Belgian troops
climbed into C-130 transport planes at midaftemoon.

Maj. A. Couwenberg, commander of one Belgian battalion, said
the troops had been ordered 130 miles north ot the town of Kamina.

“We’re going home,” he said, and it appeared some would
return to Belgium.

But _in Brussels, Belgian Premier Leo Tindemans said one
battalion of paratroops would stay at Kamina “to guarantee the
'safety” of Belgians remaining in Zaire’s southeastern Shaba
Province.

An estimated 800 troops of the French Foreign Legion remained. ‘

“Their commanders have said their mission is to pacify the province,
known as Katanga when Zaire was the Belgian Congo. The Belgian
troops said they were here only to evacuate civilians.

k Unified Programming

The Black Action Society’s letter to the Student Government
Board, accepting the Program Council concept under protest,
brings to public view several inadequacies in the Pitt Union
Program Council structure.

The main question BAS raises is the feasibility of a concert
scheduling system using a local promoter to arrange concerts
during Homecoming, Greek, Engineering and BAS W631“-
As the BAS points out, this method of programming is untried and
perhaps not as efficient as current BAS programming, which has
never depended on a promoter.

Although the promoter method is unused, the Program Council
has no guidelines or contracts with promoters, and this raises some
doubt about the ability of a promoter-program council system to
arrange the quality concerts BAS has scheduled in the past.

BAS’s fears have some ‘foundation. Without fully developed
programming plans, the Program Council appears to be only a
paper tiger. Until arrangements are made with local promoters,
BAS has a right to worry about the future of its programming.

BAS’s concern about its programming raises a larger question
about the transitional steps from a fragmented programming
system to a unified programming council. It seems the Program
Council has given little thought to the changeover procedure, and
instead counted on magically taking responsibility for all
programming beginning this summer. ,

This lack of planning has created turmoil within BAS and the
RSA. No one is sure whether the council plans to program all
events arranged by RSA and other groups, or whether the respon-
sibility will be shared by the council and other studentgroups.

What the Program Council must do to correct this problem is
simple. First, they must produce concrete guidelines about
promoter-Program Council contract arrangements and show it to
be a workable system. If it cannot work, it must schedule concerts
without a promoter.

Second, the Program Council must meet with the BAS and RSA
to determine its needs. If it is impossible for the Program Council
to meet its special needs, exceptions must be made for these special
groups to arrange their own programming under the guidance of
the Program Council.

Letters to the Editor

Fond Farewell to Malthus and Arnold

It was with great regret that I
received my May 4 edition of the
Pitt News in the mail yesterday and
found that you had put an untimely
end to the Fuzzy-Weeks strip.

As I know from my personal
involvement with The Pitt News
years ago, the strip had a certain
vitality and ability to draw readers
and consequently mold some of
their most important attitudes
toward campus life. It was

disturbing to learn that this asset to
your paper had been laid to rest.

Could it be that Matthews
Kambic and Kennedy, the authors
of the strip, are no longer in the land
of the living? Please say it ain’t so.
Yet if they still are, it could only be
that The New York Times or Esquire
Magazine has wooed them away to
allow their brilliance to illuminate a
wider audience.

This is a sad moment in American

journalism. Rupert Murdoch could
not buy one more key paper and
Walter Cronkite could not throw in
the towel and typewriter tomorrow
and make this occasion more
heartfelt than it already is.

If the Pitt News has written -30- to
the end of Fuzzy-Weeks, can the
ﬁnal toll of civilization be far
behind?

Study Commission Court Fight:Politics as Usual

their self-righteous attack on the
study commission smells like the
old political game of protecting
personal interests in the name of
“public good.”

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Allegheny County taxpayers can
sleep peacefully at night knowing
their brave county commissioners

vigilantly monitor county govern- Damaging the work of the study

group definitely serves both

ment, trimming costs wherever
possible. Their recent court battle
with the Allegheny County Gov-
ernment Study Commission shows
their never-ending concern over
wasting tax dollars.

That is what Commissioners Jim
Flaherty and Thomas Foerster want
the public to believe. The two
condemn the study commission
because it “hasn’t moved exped-
itiously” to complete its work, and
they wish it to discontinue its
operations, according to E.J.
Straussburger, of the Allegheny
County Law Department.

If Flaherty and Forester cut the
budget of some other county
agency, their worries about the
squandering of public funds might
be a little easier to swallow, but

Flaherty’s and Foerster’s personal
careers. The commission's home
rule charter proposals suggest
destroying the county commission-
er position.

In May, 1977, Allegheny County
voters elected the nine-member
study commission to “propose
changes in the powers and
structures of county government.”
A 27-page discussion draft resulted
from the group’s deliberations.

Article Two of the draft is the
section of the suggested charter
that is anathema to the county
commissioners. Entitled “Legisla-
tive Branch,” it states: “All
legislative power shall be vested in

each of ﬁve compact, continguous

~ districts...”

If ever passed by Allegheny
County voters, the clause would
mean that the three present
commissioners would need another
job; after 1980 their commis-
sionerships would no longer exist.

Although the home rule charter
represents unemployment to Com-
missioners Jim Flaherty, Tom
Foerster and Bob Pierce, it presents
a much better form of county
government.

PERSPECTIVE

Under the commission form of
government the county commis-
sioners serve as the county’s
legislators and executives. Such a
system contains none of the
separation of powers or checks and
balances traditional to American
government. As a result, the
commissioners implement the laws
they create, giving them an
inordinate amount of power.

The suggested home rule charter
draft would alleviate that problem
by delegating legislative powers to
the five-member council, and
executive powers to an elected
county executive. The system
would restore separation of powers
to county government.

A county council also seeks to
develop a more responsive county
government. The present at-large
election of county commissioners
allow commissioners to avoid
accountability for actions. Since
commissioners are elected by voters
countywide, no citizens group can
effectively pressure them by
threatening to oppose their re-
election.

Few groups are large enough to
command a bloc of votes that can
affect the result of countywide
elections. Result: a commissioner
can afford to ignore dissatisfied
electors.

Five county councilmen elected
from districts could be held
responsible to those who elect
them. If any group within a district
is displeased with their representa-
tive’s behavior, they can coerce him
to mend his ways by threatening to
oppose his re-election.

When discontents brandish the
promise of opposition in the next
campaign, a councilman must listen
because an organization with even
limited support can affect results
within a small district.

The county commissioners are
probably not the only county
officials who feel a little uneasy
about the government study
commission report. If all changes in
the discussion draft are imple-
mented by voters this November,
the foundations of the power
structure in Allegheny County could
be seriously undermined.

. Damage to the patronage system
within the 14 independent county
ofﬁces could be serious if the merit
hiring system in the proposed
charter remains intact. Currently
the positions under the sheriff,
coroner, recorder of deeds, register
of wills, prothonotary, clerk of
courts and jury commissioner are
political plums doled out to the
party faithful.

With a merit system there would
be no more patronage and reduced
inﬂuence from political parties.
Those parties now in power oppose
any curbs on the might they now
enjoy within county government.

One ﬁnal power granted county‘

government by the suggested home
rule charter is the ability to dispense
with outdated boards and commis-
sions. This power is especially
important in Allegheny County
which has the third highest number
of special districts in the United
States. Slimming the_ government
by destroying a few of the boards
and authorities no longer needed
could cut costs and increase
government efficiency.

These reforms-—a merit hiring

system, a county council,
elected county offices and the
ability to terminate outdated
boards—all promise to vastly better
our county government. However,
they also threaten to change the
status quo in county government,
which Flaherty and Foerster and
others in county government seem
to wish to retain.

Both these men have deﬁnite
interest in maintaining the present
order in Allegheny County govern-
ment. As the candidate of the old

sf“.

Democratic machine, founded W

David Lawrence, Foerster ﬁghts to
keep the patronage jobs that are the
prizes awarded to party workers.

Flaherty, also a Democrat,
represents the Pete Flaherty
organization that broke away from
the established Democratic
machine several years ago. This
organization also needs jobs for the
regulars who support Flaherty and
his allies, such as Mayor Caliguiri.'

These two members of warring
parties within the local Democratic
Party make strange bedfellows
since machine politicians hold a
grudge against Pete Flaherty and
his independent campaigns.
However, stranger things have
transpired in past games of
“politics as usual.”

Carter Reassures Scieniisis on U.S. Nuclear Policy

OAK RIDGE, Tenn.—President
Carter tried yesterday to reassure
scientists worried about his nuclear
energy policies, declaring that
atomic energy research will be
increasingly important to the
nation.

Carter told the scientists that
success in the energy ﬁeld is
“heavily on your shoulders.”

Carter stopped in Oak Ridge to
ease the scientists’ worries over
several nuclear projects he opposes
or has canceled, but he ignored the
issue the scientists ﬁnd most
controversial—-his veto of a bill
funding the Clinch River breeder
reactor.

In his opening remarks to the

scientists and energy officials, the
President said the research and
development work at Oak Ridge “is
going to be of increasing im-
portance. We are now addressing
questions that’ have ‘not been
addressed adequately.”

Though the Clinch River is less
than ﬁve miles from Oak Ridge,
Carter’s agenda included neither a
trip to the site of the proposed $2.2
billion reactor nor discussions of it
with officials.

Carter used his first veto as
President on November 5 to reject a
bill that would have authorized $80
million for the breeder reactor that
would produce weapons-grade
nuclear material. He said the

project will imperil his-effort to halt
the spread of nuclear weapons and
technology by producing more
plutonium that it would consume.

Besides the concern that the
plutonium can be converted for use
in atomic bombs, Carter has said
the technology may be outdated
before the project is built.

Carter’s visit to Oak Ridge and to
Knoxville, Tenn.,, was also seen as
repayment to Senator Howard
Baker, minority leader, for his
support of Carter’s position on the
Panama Canal treaties and of the
administration sale of warplanes to
Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia.

In an interview before Carter’s
arrival at Oak Ridge, Baker said he

Tuesday, May 23, 1978-—TI-IE PITT NEWS—Pag¢ 5

would continue efforts to keep the
Clinch River reactor project alive,
but added: “I don’t know if we can
pull it off.” The issue is being
debated in congressional com~
mittees.

Baker said he and Senator james
Sasser, D-Tenn., complained to
Carter about the rejection of the
Clinch River project and that the
President said he would take a look
at it. But, Baker noted, “Of course,
eh isn’t going to Clinch River.”

research and development.

In addition to their concern over
the Clinch River project, scientists
at Oak Ridge have expressed
irritation because Carter decided to
build a new $4.5 billion gas
centrifuge plant in Portsmouth,
Ohio, instead of at Oak Ridge.
Much of the development of the
centrifuge process, an alternative
method of enriching uranium for
use as fuel in nuclear power plants
took place at Oak Ridge.

Carter also angered the scientists
by calling for a moratorium on
chemical reprocessing, leading
Exxon Corporation to halt plans to
build a nuclear reprocessing plant
at Oak Ridge.

‘Green . Julia’ Probes Social Roles With Humor 

By VERNE L. STEIMER

The Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre is now presenting “Green
Julia” by Paul Ableman, Friday
through Sunday at 8:30 plm.

“Green Julia” is a dialogue
between two college men, parting
after ﬁve years of sharing an
apartment. The performance is
peppered "with role-playing games-
a prime vehicle of communication

between the two—which are both
riotously funny (a la Monty Python)
and deeply revealing.

Jake Perew (played by David
Miller), an economics student, is
revealed as a cold, calculating
manipulator of people who has been
sufficiently “educated” to assume
a successful career in the modern
business world. Bob Lacey (Robin
Grattan), a shy, sensitive, human-
itarian scientist, will remain at

college to develop a hybrid strain of
maize.

Jake attempts to saddle Bob with
Julia, an aging, gin-guzzling,
free-spirited (and bodied) woman
with whom Bob has been having an
affair.

The play—through the games,
jokes and probing conversations of
the two—explores the psychological
maze of male sexuality and
indirectly comments on what it
takes to succeed in our society.

The performances of Miller and
Grattan are competent and con-
vincing. Miller does, however,
seem miscast, a foot smaller and
much thinner than his counterpart.
He never quite exudes the power to
manipulate, which he supposedly
possesses.

The most appealing aspect of the
presentation is its staging. It is
played in one of the small
“performing rooms” adjacent to
the main Lab Theatre. The set gives

the audience a feeling of intimacy
and makes for a very unique,
informal and totally enjoyable
theater experience. Unfortunately,
it also limits the seating to about 30
people, so reservations are neces-
sary.

The production closes the Pitts-
burgh Laboratory Theatre’s most
successful season, with three
productions breaking attendance
records at the six-year-old theater.

‘Generation X’ Brings Punk Satire to America

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Generation X
Generation X
Chrysalis Records

There intends to be no guise to
the image Generation X wishes to
portray, which is evidenced in its

 

ﬁrst American release titled with
the British group’s name. As
admitted in its press release, the
music is pure punk rock, and
“Generation X” contains 12 songs
that categorically ﬁt every descrip-
tion of the term.

The group takes its name from a

paperback that describes the
restless youth of the 1960’s.
Generation X does not pretend to
be the Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan
of the 70’s. In fact, it purposely

confesses an oonosite musical
intent, claiming to be “definitely

not a militant punk band, but it.

possesses a very individual perky

   

“Generation X,” a British punk rock group with an album recently released in

the United States .

\

iconoclasm, displaying cheerful yet
pointed satire.”

Generation X is another of the
many European groups that hopes
to encounter the same success as
the upbeat Sex Pistols, whose
American tour last summer was
met with controversy and was an
outright failure. Not that it was a
ﬁnancial failure, but undoubtedly
the group did not ‘build the good
public relations often needed to sell
records.

Only four members compose
Generation X. The music axis is
lead singer Billy Idol; bass man
Tony‘ James, Bob Andrews’s
guitars, and Mark Laff on drums
complete the quartet. No session
musicians were utilized on the
album.

“Generation X” is not easy
listening music, and it would
proved rather difﬁcult for dancing;
all 12 songs are perfect teen-rebel
anthems.

Side A contains “Gimme Some

Truth,” “Wild Youth,” “From the
Heart,” “Ready Steady Go,”
“Kleenex”
ises.” The ﬁrst is the group’s
interpretation of John Lennon's
“Gimme Some Truth,” and not
much justice is given the original
version.

Idol uses an echo effect on his
songs, reminiscent of the style of
the Kinks, Dave Clark Five or the
Knickerbockers of the mid-60’s.

The third single, “Ready Steady
Go,” is a tribute to the English
television show of the early 60’s

and “Promises Prom- -

that premiered most of today’s
most respected British titans,

Kleenex is a satirical piece that
tells us for what to use a Kleenex
tissue. ‘Although the pace slows on

Promises Promises” for a few
seconds, Side A’s best song in no
way resembles the Burt Bachrach

song of the same name sung by
Dionne Warwick.

Side B continues the sociological
satires but features the songs that

have made Generation X a sex
renowned British rock group. “Day ‘“‘”‘-/

By Day” and “One Hundred
Punks” don’t offer any change
from the previous side. “Your
Generation” is the group’s parody-
reply to The Who and joins “Youth
Youth Youth” as another rebel
anthem.

The only two songs on the album
that break from the tempo routine
are “Wild Dub” and “Kiss Me
Deadly.” The latter, starts slow
before breaking back into fast rock;
it is the best song on the album.

“Wild Dub” is the ﬂip side of
the second single ever released by

the _band. It is a reggae-style 

version that made the bottom of the
“Best of ’77” British pop lists.

It will be interesting to follow
Generation X and this album as
they hit the American market. With
the disco craze currently monopo-
lizing music, punk rock probably
doesn’t stand much of a chance in
denting the charts here. It’s more
likely that discomania will make
punk rock a passing fad on the
European circuit.

Panthers Felder mid Silvestri Ink Free Agent Pacts

SPORTS

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt Panthers LeRoy F elder and Gary
Silvestri signed contracts as free agents last
week with the Green Bay Packers of the NFL
and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian
Football League, respectively. Felder will

' be tried at cornerback and safety by the

Packers, while Silvestri will be used at
defensive end. .

“It’s a pretty good situation,” Felder
said. ‘ ‘Overall, Green Bay has a weak team,
making it is still going to be pretty tough.
The competition in the pros is stiff
anywhere. I’m going to have to get a good

start and work my wayup from there.”

F elder added that he sees little difference
between being a late-round draft choice and
a free agent.

“The ﬁfth, maybe sixth round, is the
cutoff point,” Felder added. “After that,
the pros ﬁgure their choices are a gamble.
The only thing getting drafted does is boost

"your conﬁdence, but other than that, there’s

not that much of a difference unless you’re a
ﬁrst- or second-round choice. ’ ’

Besides Green Bay, the Steelers and Colts
reportedly wanted F elder as a free agent. He
didn’t want to go with theSteelers since they
made a defensive back their ﬁrst-round draft
choice and had another reason for not
signing with the hometown Baltimore Colts.

‘ ‘I didn’t want to go there because of what

they did to Larry Felton last year,” he said
about his old Pitt teammate. “They signed
him as a free agent, then cut him. He wasn’t
given that much of a chance to make the
team.”

Silvestri, who last year started at
defensive tackle for Pitt, signed a one-year
pact with Calgary as a defensive end.

Felder and Silvestri join eight drafted
teammates (Randy Holloway, Matt Cavan-
augh, Bob Jury, Randy Reutershan, Elliott
Walker, Willie Taylor, J .C. Wilson and Tom
Brzoza) in the pro ranks.

The terms of both Silvestri’s and Felder’s
contracts were not announced.

St. Dennis Looking
For lift in Games

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Improvement is the key for Pitt
student Rich St. Dennis as he
prepares for next month’s light-
weight weight lifting competition at
the National Wheelchair Olympics
in Fisherville, Va.

“I’d like to lift either 325 or 330
pounds,” the junior said. “It’s
going to be hard, but I think I can
do it.”

At last week’s Pennsylvania
games in Clearﬁeld, St. Dennis, a
Shaler Township resident, ﬁnished
ﬁrst with a lift of 310 pounds.
’I'hat’s a» 40-pound improvement
over last year, when he finished
third nationally, and was one of his

beat, ’ ’ St.
“Then again,

about. ’ ’

It will be St. Dennis’s second
straight year competing in the
games, which are held annually.
Besides weight lifting, about 300
-athletes can compete in all. track
and ﬁeld events, swimming and
table tennis. '

Regionalqualiﬁers are held in 19
states; winners advance to national
competition-. There is no limit on
the number of regional qualiﬁers
in which an athlete may compete.

In addition to his ﬁrst-place .
ﬁnish in Pennsylvania, St. Dennis
ﬁnished first in Ohio and second in
Virginia.

“You can never tell how you will
do in the nationals,” he said. ‘‘I did

Coast that I don’t_ even know

St. Dennis, paralyzed from the
waist down two years ago following
a skiing accident, became involved
with the Olympics in November
1976 and began his competitive
weight-lifting career.

“Before it (the accident) hap-
pened, I didn’t really care if I lifted
or not,” St. Dennis said. “When I
did lift, it was more or less to look
or feel better. I never cared to

“After the accident,” he added,
“the doctors told me there was an
outside chance that I might be able -
to walk using braces if I
strengthened my legs by lifting

“I thought I’d give it a try,” St.
Dennis continued, noting he rarely
uses the braces. “Since then, I’ve
become hooked on it. I’ve reached
a point where if I don't do it, I feel
bad; I guess you could say I’m

“Lifting is a big part of my life,”
St. Dennis said. “It takes up a lot of
energy, but I enjoy it.”

Oilers mu Not Be in Soup Despite   Carmbell’s Contract

°Houston Oiler season ticket sales have increased
5,036 since the announcement that the team planned
to make Earl Campbell the first pick of the‘NFL
draft. This increase ups the Oilers’ total of season
ticket subscriptions to 36,500, which is a team
record. At an average of $122 per subscription, the
extra season ticket revenue will pay ‘for almost half of
Campbell’s reported six-year $1.4 million contract.
Houston, which receives 40 percent of the gate on the
road, could make up the balance in the first year with
Campbell’s gate appeal.

0 The trend of athletes taking a vow of silence with
sportswriters has spread from baseball and football
(which provided the father of the movement, Duane
Thomas) into basketball. Darryl Dawkins,
Philadelphia 76ers center, made one final comment
before taking his final vow of silence.

“Nothing means nothing, but it isn’t really
nothing before nothing is something that isn’t,”
Dawkins philosophized.

That comment reflects about as much intelligence
and continuity as the Sixers’ play during the NBA
playoffs the last two years.

0 Carson Long, ex-Panther and incumbent
placekicker for the Buffalo Bills, didn’t exactly get a
vote of confidence from new coach Chuck Knox,
who left the Los Angeles Rams to take the job. Knox
recently signed free agent Tom Dempsey, who kicked
placements for him while the pair was with the Rams.

0 Joe McDonald, general manager of the New
York Mets has put Tom Seaver’s old uniform in an
office safe to prevent souvenir hunters from making
off with a prize catch. The way New York is playing

(18-22), Seaver’s uniform is the only valuable one the
Mets own.

0 The proposal tha
ﬁe? . . . . . . ,- - . . 1 .

    

programs in football and basketball has inspired a
New Jersey newspaper columnist to devise an alter-
native proposition. William Earls suggests with
tongue-in-cheek that the NCAA abandon the present
geographic system of dividing schools into conferen-
ces and replace it with an intellectual system.
Under the Earls plan, schools that require the athlete
be able to read and write would be in one conference;
schools that require only the reading level of a high
school sophomore would be in another,_ and so on.
Conferences could then be renamed the Brain
Division, Smart Set or Dumb 10.

0 Jockey Steve Cauthen could be the only person
on earth to leave Howard Cosell speechless. In a
taped interview that was seen as the horses went to
the post in Saturday’s Preakness, Cosell asked
Cauthen about the constant demands from the
media.

“Ya know,” Cauthen said, “it’s been all right.

When I can do it with people like you, it’s a lot
easier.” ’

“You’re very kind, Stevie,” was all Cosell could I A

manage to say.

Cauthen, probably the richest 18-year-old in the
world (he earned $660,000 last year), never has a
discouraging word for the media and confines his
displeasure with an interviewer to mild rebukes such
as “jockeys are the same as other people, only
smaller.”

With Cauthen, the smallness.is p1_1r_ely physical.
~ 0 With the Pirates’ bullpen woes of late, it is in-
teresting to note the accomplishments of Elias Sosa,
who was traded with a minor leaguer and cash to

Oakland for Manny Sanguillen. Sosa is 4-0, with *4’

four saves and an .088 earned run average in 30 in-

nings pitched. Sanguillen, who until recently was bat~ 5

tling Will McEnaney for the invisible man award,
has been to the plate only 38 times with two runs bat-
ted in.

0The Dalas Cowboys’ cheerleaders, the group that
receives the most exposure by the media, receive very
little for their talents. Each girl receives $15 per
game, must clean their own uniforms, attend all
practices and arrive at the stadium two hours prior to
each home game. Dallas also brought the girls to
New Orleans for the Super Bowl a few hours before
kickoff and sent them home right after the game.

°Remember when Gene Alley was a regular for the
Pirates and fans didn’t have to hold their breath
every time the shortstop had to field a ground ball
and make a throw to first base? I

Nicldaus’ Schedde Works Well

By The Associated Press

ATLANTA—Jack Nicklaus’s new
playing schedule, a trimmed-down
version that places even greater
emphasis on the Big Four, is
working very, very well. Perhaps
too well.

It’s working so well it may have
cost him the 1978 Masters title.

“I was never better prepared for
.a tournament in my life,” said
Nicklaus, who has built his golﬁng
career around the Masters, the
U.S. and British Opens and the
PGA. He’s won those events a
record 14 times. And now, at age
38, he’s cut back on his regular tour

more on those four tournaments.

to motivate the players as well as to
inspire them, to the degree that
would result in a Stanley Cup
victory has been exhausted,” Shero
explained at a press conference in
his agent’s ofﬁce.

The Flyers issued a statement
yesterday saying that Shero submit-
ted ‘his resignation last Thursday,
but that they had not accepted it.

Flyers’ General Manager Keith

seven or eight teams capable of
going all the way. Dallas should be
one of them. But no team can be
regarded as a cinch.”

Staubach was in New York to
receive a two-foot-high, 60-pound
bronze trophy presented by Pro
Quarterback magazine on the basis
of a nationwide poll of football
writers. Bob Griese of the Miami
Dolphins ﬁnished second, Ken
Stabler of the Oakland Raiders
third.

The’ former Navy man and
Heisman Trophy winner, at 6-3 and
190 pounds, looked the picture of
physical ﬁtness.

‘ ‘A quarterback is only as good as
his throwing arm and his legs,” he
said. “My arm and legs are as good
as they have ever been. I am in
perfect shape.

“My health will determine how
much longer I will play. Right now I
would say that would be a few years.
I don’t want to specify how many,
but I have two more years on my
contract. Ihope to play those years
and maybe some more.”

_ We do our best, but
I sometimes it’s not enough.” ‘

state; my conﬁdence, everything-
as close to having it just where I
wanted it as I’ve ever been,”
Nicklaus recalled.

In his four appearances prior to
the Masters he’d won twice and
ﬁnished second twice and collected
$155,000. His stroke average was
sub-70. ‘ He was very obviously,
near the top of his game. And he
was going into a tournament he’s
won a record ﬁve times on a course
he knows so well.

But Gary Player won it, shooting
64 in the last round for a 277 total.

Nicklaus was seventh with
rounds of 72, 73, 69 and 67 and a
281 total.

And, , he says, it’s his own
‘fault——the fault of his too-good

preparations——-that he let it get
away. .

“We were halfway through the
third round before I ﬁnally woke up
and realized I wasn’t leading,”
Nicklaus said.

“I was so well prepared, so
confident, I guess I thought I had it
won before we started,” he said.
“I’m sure I was never more
conﬁdent that I’d win a tourna-
ment. '

“I was so confident that for the
ﬁrst two rounds I guess I was
playing protectively, protecting ‘a
lead I didn’t really have,” Nicklaus
added.

“Then, when Iwoke up Saturday
afternoon, I was too far behind to
catch up,” he said. “There
weren't enough holes left.”

Allen said he and board chairman
Ed Snider had asked to meet again
with their reluctant coach to see if
they could get him to change his
mind.

Allen refused to say when the
meeting would take place with
Shero, who has one year left on his
Flyers’ contract.

Shero said he was available for
such a meeting but that nothing
would change his mind.

Staubach said he was keeping in

lifting weights, running, playing
tennis and basketball. The first

in the 27-10 Super Bowl victory over

LANDOVER, Md.—“Now they
know that we're for real,” declared
Seattle forward Paul Silas.

Silas, a 14-year veteran of the pro
basketball wars, was savoring the
Super Sonics’ stunning comeback
from a 19-point third-quarter deﬁcit
to a 106-102 victory over the
Washington Bullets in Sunday’s
opening game of the National
Basketball Association playoff

With the next two games of the
best-of-seven championship series
to be played at the Capital Centre
Thursday night and Sunday after-
noon, Silas believes it was vital for
the Sonics to win the series opener
in Seattle.
