Encounter Symposium Stresses Involvement

Educational Changes Explored

by DREW PORUAZNIK

During the past two years. the
Undergraduate Cabinet of the
School of Education has explored
areas of change in schooling by
offering encounter symposiums.
Past programs have dealt pri-
marily with innovations 'in ed-
ucation. This year. however. the
politics and economics of educa-
tion will be investigated in the
third encounter program entitled
“Who Rules the Schools." The
need for involvement of the com-

’ munityi in schools and the need to

democratize the schools are two
areas which will be emphasized
at the symposium.

This year the encounter will be
held on March 9 and 10 in David
Lawrence Hall and at Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall. The pro-
gram begins on Friday, March 9.
at 7:30_p.m. in David Lawrence

Hall with the topic "The Politics I

of Education." The speakers will
be Nat Hentoff. author of Our
Children Are Dying, and Dr. Ar-

thur Pearl, professor of education
at the University of California at
Santa Cruz and author of The
Atrocity of Education.

On Saturday, March 10, from 10
a.m. to-‘5’p.m. numerous work-
shops will be held in David Law-

Vrence Hall. The workshops will

cover areas such as student's and
teacher's rights, alternate high
schools, monetary cutbacks in ed-
ucation, and teachers’ unions.
Various people in the education
fields, both locally and nationally,
will be in charge of these work-
shops, each of which’ will be com-
posed of a lecture followed bya»
discussion with the audience.

That evening at 7:30 in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall. the
encounter program will feature
Herbert Gintis and Stephen Mich-
elson. both from Harvard. Thier
topic. which is based on their re-
search, will be "Inequality: A Re-
assessment of the Effect of Fam-
ily and Schooling in America."

Tony Sunseri, Jr.. a resident of
the Greenfield area of Pittsburgh
and a sophomore at the Universi-
ty, has announced his candidacy
for a position on the city coun-
cil of Pittsburgh.

Sunseri, who says he has al-
‘ways been "interested in Pitts-
brugh politics and government."
decided to run for council after
reading an article in the Pitts-

as “that’s damn white of you” and ,

“the jig is up.” “Language,” he
said, “carries the curse of our
republic.”

Talking about present day
America. Colodny claimed. "A
majority of Americans are alien-
ated from politics and are politi-
cally inactive. therefore. it is
with an easy conscience that they
tolderate the political reality of
racism." He feels that "we are
guilty of knowing what the politi-
cal process is and withdrawing
from it. letting the process work

towards evil ends. Most Ameri-

cans were aware of what white
America has done to the Indians

and then the blacks. It does not
"require any special graces to see
that what Americans have done is
a crime and to be indifferent is to
be an accomplice before and after
the fact." '

He called ghettos "monuments
to the fatal flaw in our national
character. We have sculpted, the
object of our own deepestfears.‘C

Colodny concluded by saying
that the solution to the problem
lies in the young, that same group
that “saved us from a greater de-
bacle in Southeast Asia.” He feels
that the racist “sins of thefathers
will not be visited upon the sons.”
We will be a guilt free popula-
tion,” he claimed, “when the last

black ghetto has been torn down I

and the last black family has been
resettled in the open spaces.”

Dr. Samuel Hayes then present-
ed the motion that "racial and
ethnic differences and the atti-
tudes which accompany those dif-

ferences_are. for most .Ameri-J,‘

cans. a way of life." While not

making a value. judgment. he did ’

-from Christian Rituals

She explained that a society that
develops to a level where laws
must be formed is going to be sus-
picious of magical rituals and cu_s-
toms because of the threat they
pose to the governing officials. In
primitive times, she added, offi-
cials felt that the witches did have
powers and were afraid they
would use their powers to take
over controls of the government.

Mulhare discussed why witch
burnings became popular. One
theory was that it was one way of

i , getting rid of the older people in

society or enemies. she explained.
"In primitive society. witchcraft
was the number one explanation
of evil doings.” she said. If the
populace didn’t understand some-
thing they would blame it on
witchcraft and the burnings of old
men and women became a “res-
olution of social tensions.“

Much of the ritual involved in.

witchcraft. Mulhare explains. has
been taken from Christian prac-
tices. The uses of candles and
wine play a significant part in the

witchcraft rituals as well as in 0

the Christian rituals. .

“Often,” added Mrlhare. “What-
ever is bugging the society at a
particular time becomes a cri-
teria for the witchcraft ritual.
For example a person wishing to
become a witch must perform a
deed which society would look
down on him forf" she said.

Peace Corps and VISTA will be
recruiting at Pitt March 5-8 and
will be looking for liberal arts
majors graduating this year. Un-
like several years ago. opportun-
ities exist for liberal arts students
in the two volunteer service or-
ganizations.

Interview booths will be lo-
cated in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. the main floor of the Student

Union. and the Placement Office .

(Student Union second floor).

“The purpose of the interviews
will be to supply information to in-
terested seniors, not to sell the
programs,” said Clem McClin-
tock, Pennsylvania Recruitment
Officer for Peace Corps and
VISTA (Volunteers in Service to
America).

/"Most seniors already know
enough about the programs if they
are considering this’ option for
employment after graduation."
McClintock said. “Our job will be
to tell them what their chances
are in Peace Corps and VISTA and
whether or not they should pursue
this option.

"More and more our emphasis
is on matching people with pro-
grams. placing volunteers where
they may best serve those who
need help.

“Both programs are looking for
persons who have something to
offer. Our purpose is to serve the
people, not the volunteers,” main-
tained McClintock.

The Peace Corps has about 4.000
positions open and expects to fill

them from 30000 applications.
while VISTA anticipates‘ 20.0‘00
applications for 2.000 positions.

VISTA is looking for volunteers
skilled in law. architecture.
health. education. civil engineer-
ing. agriculture. and physical ed-
ucation. Students fluent in French
are needed by Peace Corps. while
those who are fluent in Spanish
are needed by VISTA.

McClintock said, “We areinot

looking for just older or exper-.

ienced people. Pitt is one of the
two schools in Pennsylvania from
which we expect the most avail-
able skills, the most potential, and
the most applicants."

VISTA volunteers sign up l'or
one-year terms while the Peace
Corps requires a two-year service
period. About one—third of the vol-

unteers renew their terms of
service with both of these organ-
izations. ‘

When asked about cutbacks in
funding. McClintock denied that
the Nixon Administrations eco-
nomic policy was affecting his or-
ganizations. "We're just not big
enough for them to care about."
he said. "The President's new
budget recommends the same
funding for Peace Corps and
VISTA as last year.

"Were different from programs
such as Model Cities. We deal in
people. not programs. However.
we are being affected indirectly
by cuts in funding for the OEO
(Office of Economic Opportun-
lt_\‘t. The OEO supplies 38 per
cent of the funding for our pro-
grams." explained McClintock.

Sunseri ls Canc iclate

(Continued from Page I)

Sunseri objects to the closed
door policy of the Flaherty admin-
istration. "The mayor never lets
people know whats going on." he
said. While agreeing with the ma-
yor's attempts at a workable aus-
terity budget, Sunseri declared

the cutbacks in the fire depart- -

ment and 'the mayor‘s obvious
"lack of tact."

Fielding questions about speci-
fic issues in the city, Sunseri fav-
ored the building of a convention
center “downtown,” a tax break
to encourage industries to remain
in the city, and a program of
neighborhood and housing devel-

opment.

Sunseri will present himself be-
fore the Democratic Committee
meeting this Saturday at the*Syria
Mosque. He is seeking the party‘s
endorsement and is in favor of a

- "unified" Democratic Party.

He outlined his aspirations for
next year's council. "City coun-
cil should be a link between the
mayor and the people. if the peo-
ple want something done they
should be able to go to the council
members for help.“ Sunseri said
that as a councilman he would al-
ways be available to fulfill this
role.

Historical View of female progress, I I

World War I, and Women

by MONICA A. CIROCCO

"Women in World War I“ was
discussed by Maurine Greenwald
of the Women‘s Studies Depart-
ment on Wednesday. The lecture.
sponsored by the Undergraduate
History Forum. focused on the
impact of World War I on the pro-
gress of women.

Through an investigation of
women‘s roles in three major
areas: industry. government. and
labor. Greenwaldiillustrated that
although WWI had created new
opportunities for women.-it also
served to bring about new re-
strictions upon and discrimina-
tory practices against women.

In pre-war industry, Greenwald
explained, women occupied un-
skilled jobs, but when a male la-
bor shortage resulted from the

war women suddenly found them-,

selves in machine shops. She em-
phasized that although the list of
new entries of women in industry
during WWI seemed impressive,
when a particular job was placed
in the context of industry as a
whole, it was evident that no real
progress had been made because

women were still labeled as “un- _

skilled.”

Moving to the topic of govern-
ment. Greenwald said that many
contradictions became apparent
during the period. To illustrate
her point. she noted that protec-

_ tive legislation for women was so

severely abused that it actually
wasa hindrance rather than an
improvement. She -added that
women were restricted to work-
ing no more, than nine hours a day.
while many of the higher paying
jobs required 10 hours. with the
consequence of less pay.

Finally. focusing on la bor.'
Greenwald maintained that the
war became a contest between the
sexes. She stated that men were
alarmed at the possibility of wage
cuts. but the main problem was

White Guilt

(Continued from Page I)

"we-they feelings" negate poten-
tial white guilt. Most whites. he

concludes. simply do not feel_
guilty.
Dr. Yusef Ali. who followed

Hayes. stated that whites have
"no sense of collective guilt.
Most whites do not relate to
blacks on a human level. they do
not see themas being on their
level and. therefore. it is easy for
them to. rationalize racist con-
duct. Yusef contends most whites
won't accept responsibility and
are "prone to silence or even un-
aware of their prejudice.“ Yusef

actually that of the struggle for ..
union recognition. - v « 

 

World War 1, she noted, had, ,9],
spurred a tremendous number of‘, 
strikes which the government]: 
could not permit because war-‘Q

Consequently, although women 
were employed and were willing} ‘
to join unions they were denied:

Greenwald saw the war as. ayf
"horizontal opening of jobs." and —.
emphasized that stigmatization’
of "women‘s jobs“ occurred. "
"Women saw the war as a way» to .
make gains. but only short-run"-j‘:.
gains were made. By the 1920'.s..j’
women lost any gains they had.

 The Wednesday, Feb. 21, edi-
tion of this paper ran a first page
-article on council hopeful and Pitt
freshmang Richard Green. I will
not waste the ink commenting on
Richard Green’s candidacy, how-
ever, I do feel compelled to com-
‘them; on his unfair and unsubstan-
tiated attacks on Democratic ma-
yoralty candidate Councilman
Richard S. Caliguiri.

'. Three comments contained’ in
the article are particularily de-
serving of clarification and re-
buttal; Green contends that “the
councilmen (apparently not in-
cluding city councilwoman Amy
Ballinger) seem to be strictly
part-time. Their doors are not
open to the public.” Nothing could
be further from the truth. Just to-
day I spoke to Councilman Edgar
Michaels and Caliguiri who were
-b_oth very friendly and helpful.

' Maybe Richard had eaten
onions before he attempted to talk
tothe councilmen. Caliguiri is not
a ‘‘part-time’’ councilman. It is
his only job and he does it quite
well. Anyone who has followed
Pittsburgh politics, even superfi-
cially knows that he is the hardest
working and most involved of all
the -councilmen. Green secondly
claims that “Caliguiri did not do
enough while in council to justify
his arrogant position now.”

 -I.-object first to his use of word
'?‘arrogant,” his position seems
 to be a‘ responsible one based on
 _a- plethora of knowledge and ex-
perience. Secondly, if Green is at-
tempting to cast Caliguiri in the
role of a do-nothing councilman-
he hascome tothe wrong place.

1, Caliguiri initiated the Home
Rule Study Commission, drew up
the Zoo Society concordat—when
the’ mayor could not and has con-
sistent/ly supported programs
for» the renewal of Pittsburgh’s
‘neighborhoods. His courageous
stand on the Skybus issue and
just recently on the Schenley
‘Park seating rink issue all indi-
cate his dedication to this city.
He has always been where the
action has been in this city.

I‘ .Finally, he uses the name “Cali-
gu-iri”.and the phrase “graft and
corruption” in the same sentence.
It Green is trying albeit feebly to
insinuate that there is. a connec-
tion he had better come up with
good reasons for ignoring Cali-

honest public service and political
independence. Either Green does
not read newspapers, does not
realize what he is talking about
or is deliberately lieing. And this
we must all strongly object to.

Letters to the Editor

Chivalry is Alive

Editor, The Pitt News:

Contrary to popular opinion,
the age of American chivalry is
not dead; it is latently hiding in
the body of one David T. Maurer.
We wish to publicly acknowledge
his actions of Feb. 18, 1973, in
helping a temporarily disabled in-
dividual get to an important meet-
ing. One never expects such assis-
tance from others, yet when such
events do occur, they are deeply
and truly appreciated.

Very sincerely.
Two Senior Women

Watermellon Egos P

Editor, The Pitt News: I

At this point in time I have only
one question. Is one of the pre-
requisites of being a Ph.D. hav-
ing an ego the size of a watermel-
lon? Each one of them is an au-
thority on something. I’m an au-
thority on nothing, which offends

a lot of people, especially after’

paying for four years ofadvanced
ditch-digging at a state accredit-
ed institution. Now they want me
for four more years. But I think
I can see the light at the end of
the tunnel. "

The modern classroom situa-

,' tion is, by the choice of some peo-

ple in charge, “akin to a prison.
The warden holds the key grade in
his teeth and grins a subconscious
grin. It is therefore hard to see,
but philosophically speaking, it
still exists".

Play the game and they‘ll let
you out.

Solo Opinion

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am encouragd by your recent
appeal for letters to the editor,
and have decided to make known

“to you an opinion of mine which I

cherish, since I seem to be the
only person within_ the continental
U.S. who holds it- V

I refer to my pronounced apathy
in regard to the new Messiah,
Johnny Majors, and his brand
new, rock ’em, sock ’em,win or
die football program here at Iowa

—oops, I mean Pitt.

Perhaps I am the only student
around who chose Pitt for reasons
of academic excellence, variety
of programs, and year-round ses-
sions. It will surprise many to
know that some people do not even
consider the football team cru-

' cial, or even really necessary.

Don't get me wrong. I’m no
Commie, or drop-out, etc. who de-
sires to tear down all that other
people hold dear. I simply believe
that when so much fanfare is at-
tached to a college football pro-
gram by peoplewho have nothing
to do with the University itself
(Mr. Curry of KDKA is a prime
example), priorities have been

shuffled somewhere along the,

line.‘ ,

I should urge all students to re-
member a couple of points: first,
that someday you will want a job
or fellowship or the like, and no
one is going to ask what your
school’s football team did while

you were there. It simply doesn't

matter once you enter the cold,
hard world. Second your new Mes-
siah has feet of clay. He was wide-
ly held to be the chosen one to
lead Iowa State into the Promised
Land. and seemed headed in that
direction, when our dear athletic
department tempted, him with

that old devil, money. It didn’t '3"

take him long to leave the pulpit
on the plains, and if anyone b-
lieves that Majors would turn
down greener grass elsewhere at
a more prestigious football fac-
tory for more money. then that
person needs more education than
he is likely to get here or any-
where else.

Maybe next hear the Panthers
can win five games and tie one.

and go to the Liberty Bowl or
some equally important contest.

Whoopee.
Yours truly.

Rebuttal

Editor, The Pitt News:

In Andrew Sopko’s criticism of
the Winter 1973 issue of Ideas and

‘ Figures he questioned the dignity

of creative writing found within
its pages. I, therefore, must ques-
tion the dignity found in Sopko’s
article or any article written by a

critic.

' I question his intentions and
those of all critics because I be-
lieve that the fundamental aim of
a critic is to destroy the artistic
creations that he himself has fail-
ed to create. On the other hand,
the artist or poet has only the
need to do the best that he can to
construct his picture of life as he
sees it.

Remember that I stated that
this is my belief about critics.
The critic turns his belief into
fact. Therefore, I, as a staff mem-
ber and contributor, can only ac-
cept the opinions of the pur-

chasers of Ideas and Figures and,‘

of course, the opinion of my
peers. When I refer to my pegrs,
I refer to my fellow poets of equal
or greater ability than my own.
Thus far, the reaction from both

of these groups has been extreme- .

ly promising. In fact, the poems
or the lines from these poems
which Sopko so harshly attacked
were highly praised by one of the
most accomplished poets in Pitt’s
English Department. I ask you
now, who are you going to believe?

Three more faults that Mr.
Sopko illustrates are: first. his

' inability to interpret a single ‘line

of poetry; second, his lack of
knowledge of what he considers
the "primary rules of verse“;
and finally, his belief that sex and
death are themes which are over-
emphasized. If we eliminate sex
and death from literature and
from our everyday life we have
little or nothing left. Some of the
poems that he believes are in-
spired by sex or death are really
inspired by love. It’s asad day
when a man cannot tell the differ-
ence between sex and love.

Like Sopko, I ask, “What does it
all mean?” Simply that Sopko’s
“flesh was evidently as weak as
his spirit is.” Once he learns to
see beyond the fingers that pound
upon the typewriter in his office,
then and then alone will he be
able to see the true meaning of
the creative writing found in this
vastly improved edition of Ideas
and Figures.

A Column And A Half

by JOHN METCALFE

A recent article in another student newspaper published
here in the city. from offices which simultaneously overlook
the Monongahela River and the discount stores along the upper
part of the downtown segment of Fifth Ave.. in an institution
which is close to but not identical with Mercy Hospital.

This has gone too far. The Duquesne Duke recently printed
an article which began as follows:

“In an effortlto make Duquesne’s resident area more se-
cure and less prone to intrusions from perverts or visitors from
Pitt . . .” '

That sample should be sufficient. As you may already sus-
pect. the author of this triple chose- not to do so under his real
name. Instead. he signs himself simply “Fuzz." A wise de-
cision. ’ '

Aside from the gross unlikelihood that any visitor from
Pitt, much less the average pervert, would voluntarily choose
to visit the Bluff (Webster :
fold; hoodwink. I could go on.). The Duke has erred greviously
in lumping the two classes of possible visitors together. It is
rare that there would ever be both perverts and visitors from
Pitt in the neighborhood of Duquesne University at the same
time. This is the result of an exchange program.

The details are rather too complicated to deal with here.
Briefly, the University of Pittsburgh sends visitors to Du:
quesne. In return, then send us perverts.

Now that we have been slandered by this anonymous hack,
I think we should bring the exchange program to a close. We
had hoped that at least some of our visitors would add a .little
lustre tolDuquesne; in our wilder moments we allowed our-
selves to imagine that a few of them ‘would infiltrate the Duke
and improve it. -Such has not been the case.

In return, we will give.«up the perverts, except for three who
escaped and have so far eluded capture by masquerading as ad-
ministrators and one who has tenure.

  Cats Cooled Off By Ho

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor
"That's been our history all
year—we can catch them but we
can’t pull it out,” sighed Pitt’s
head coach Buzz Ridl after the
Panthers came near to victory
only to be shot down by Virginia
on Wednesday night by the score

‘ of 79-66.

In their last home game of the
1972-73 season the Panthers strug-

’ gled {to within one point of catch-

ing up with the Virginia Cavaliers
only to be abruptly shut off at the
end.

TOMORROW’S basketball game
in which the Panthers battle
Penn State at State College will
be televised back to Pittsburgh
on Channel 13.

The game will get under way
at 2:30 p.m. and will be broad- '
casted by the Penn State televi-
sion crew. l

The Cavaliers completely dom-
inated the first three quarters of
the game. By 5:39 in the half the
Virginia squad had padded its

lead to a neat 15 points..

‘A; The Cats showed their first real

\,.

 

‘spark of life in the remaining

‘ minutes before the jaunt to the

locker rooms. .

Sophomore Kirk Bruce started
the surge for Pitt, hitting on a 14
foot shot. Bill “Mooney” Knight
followed with nine points during
which time the Cavaliers could
only pick up one basket.

Jim Bolla completed the on-
slaught, hitting on a layup and
thereby slicing the Virginia lead
down to only five points.

The Cavaliers rallied in the last
seconds of the half, however, to
hold an eight point edge, 35-28.

The major assault by the Cats
on the Virginia lead came with
seven minutes gone in the second
half. ‘With 12:43 showing on the
clock and the score at 51-42. Pitt
started its second and most pres-
sure packed comeback of the eve-
ning.

Within the next three minutes
the Panthers came within one
point of tying the Cavaliers. In
this time Knightand Bruce sank
two baskets each. and Bill Silkow-
ski came up with two points.

Bruce’s second basket of this
time series, a 14 foot point front
show, was the golden basket that
put the Cats within the one point
margin, 51-50. '

The mounting pressure applied
by the Panthers was shortlived,
however. The Cavaliers, very
quickly (within 1:22 minutes to be
exact) and very efficiently, snuf-
fed the Panther drive.

For within less than a minute
and one half Virginia racked _up
nine points to silence the ‘Panther
momentum for the rest of the
game. ’

Leading scorer and rebounder

again for Pitt was Knight with 30
points and 14 rebounds. Knight
also moved into seventh place in
the‘ list of all-time leading scorers
at Pitt with the points he collect-
ed on Wednesday.

"Bill Knight is the best we‘_ve
played against this year,“
acknowledged Virginia coach Bill»
Gibson. -

Bruce also had an impressive
showing against the Cavaliers.
coming up with 14 points.

The Panther defenders were
able to harness Virginia's star
Barry Parkhill, allowing him to
score only eight points all eve-
ning',(he is averaging 17.8 per
game) but were unable to handle
Gus Gerard. ’

Gerard shot way over his av-
erage of 13.1, matching Knight
with 30 points. Second in scoring
for Virginia was freshman Wally
Walker with 14 points.

ALL girls wishing to compete for
the 1973-74 squad of the Pan-
therettes should come to Trees
Hall on Wednesday, Feb. 28, at
/4 p.m. Other practices will be
held throughout the first half
of March, with final tryouts be-
ing held on March 16.

 Wrestling Easterns Hit Town

The Pitt grapplers would like
to see about 10 of their wrestlers
around for the 6 and 8 o'clock
shows. an occurance which would
greatly depend on the Cat‘s upset-
ting some people. It‘s no secret
that powerful Penn State. only
once beaten in dual meets is the
heavy favorite to cop the Eastern
title this year. Navy and Lehigh
are expected to slug it out for sec-
ond place. and nobody except for
Coach Dave Adams is mentioning
the Panthers in the same breath
with the perennial powerhouses.

‘The Cats“ have been called a
"tournament team" by some. and
a young. inexperienced bunch by
most. including Adams, so Pitt‘s
chances must be eyed warily. and
the Panthers filed under ':ques-

—tion mark" for the time being.

Dave Adams‘ squad. only 6-8 dur-
ing the dual season. with no wins
and a few near-misses over the
East‘s top schools. have been
waiting patiently foria crop of
sophomores and freshmen to dry
theirwings.

Four Cats have been consistent
this season, and their steadiness
alone merits the Panthers a dark-
horse role, one capable of shock-
ing someone, hopefully Penn
State."George “Fuddy” Bryant at
118 pounds may be Pitt’s classiest
matman. He has, by his own ad-
mission, national title aspira-
tions. Unfortunately, the com-

I champion Navy. Larry Lauchle.

and one NCAA title for ‘the
Panthers in the late '50s and
early 1960s. is‘ the head coach

petition for the lightest weight
will probably be the toughest, and
Fuddy won’t be_afforded the lux-
ury of a let-up. In fact, the com-
petition is so good, that the win-
ner of a Bryant-’l‘eagarden-Frick-

co melee may very well cop the-

big championship in Seattle.

For the Panthers at 150 pounds
is the Cat‘s grittiest grappler.
John Buzzato. who came from
nowhere to 11-3 this year. has
beaten every tough Eastern op-

ponent he has faced except one—'

Navy‘s Ross Chaffin. Buzzato

' wants to meet Chaffin in the finals.

and he wants that Eastern title to
wash down the bitterness of being
a three-year doormat.

John "Bimbo?-' Chatman at 158

pounds is last year's Eastern run- -

nerup. Bimbo was upset last Feb-'
ruary. 7-6. by Yale‘s Alan Gary.
Gary has graduated and the title
is up for grabs. Chatman's 7-1
record may be suspect, however.
for he started, the season late due
to injuries. and has missed six
matches. If he’s sharp, Chatman
could be a good bet for an East-
ern championship. Z

The last consistent Panther,
who‘ was conspicuously disap-
pointing in early dual action, is
Craig Tritch. Tritch is one of two

" Pitt seniors (the other is Buzzato)

in the tournament, and sports a
deceptive 7-4 mark. Craig started

Pitts last individual champion
came last year in Philadelphia
when Kevin Love completely do-
minated the 150-pound weight
class.’ Love pinned three of his
fourqopponents "and the other
he blanked. 11-0.

For his performance Love was
presented with the Sheridan Tro-
phy. given to the person who re-
gisters the most falls in the least
amount of time. It is ‘given in
memory of Billy Sheridan. head
coach at Lehigh from 1911-1952.

and the presentation of the John
Fletcher Memorial Trophy. The
Outstanding Wrestler is deter-
mined by a vote of the coaches.
while the Fletcher Trophy goes
to the wrestler who -has contri-
buted the most points to his team
in EIWA tournaments.

The battle for the Fletcher
Trophy could be the closest in
history this year. Senior Ross
Chaffin of Navy has accumu-

tournaments to lead the field.

Collegiate wrestling has to lie somewhere between the‘

ancient Grecian games and contemporar_v—-but somewhat‘ sus-

picious+'studio' wrestling. ,

This. of course, includes Dave Adams‘ Pitt grap squad
as well as the 15 other schools» (160 total athletes) that have
invaded the city of Pittsburgh for the 69th annual showcas-
ing of the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association
championships, that are being hosted today and tomorrow at
the Pitt Field House. ’

Just where the colleges lie in relation to the other two
is uncertain. The Greeks were national heroes and the pro-
fessionals make a handsome penny for their acting ability.
The collegians, according to Craig Tritch. -
who has wonhis last six matches as a Pan-
ther and who could surprise in the 190 pound.
weight class. have a tough time getting
someone tobuy them a cup of coffee.

Tritch has a valid point. When was the
last time you heard of a wrestler signing a
six-figure sports contract? And unless your
name is Dan Gable, glory is a long winding
road. Tritch continues to wrestle, however,
so there must be something in it for him.

Teammates George Bryant and John Chatman wrestle
and they know why.

Chatman isla nice. pleasant fellow. His voice never hits
the electrifying pitch of one of his lightning quick take-
downs and though he is called "Bimbo". he hardly resem-

‘/-

bles an elephant. Have you ever seen a sloven wrestler‘? ‘-

There aren’t'any. brother!

“I don’t feel I have ‘to prove my masculinity on the
mat,” Chatman calmly explained. “I think people can see that
by looking at me. It’s more a sense of achievement or a feel-
ing of superiority. ‘ r . v -A

"If a scientist invents something. hexhas. this feeling of
accomplishment. That's one part of it."

Chatman. who has at least temporarily bypassed a more
illustrious football career to concentrate on becoming a na--’
tional wrestling champion. has a great shot at "inventing“
an Eastern title at the 158 pound class.

“It’s going to be a matter of who is up. when the time
comes,” Chatman‘ speculated, “I don’t want to put myself on
the spot, but I think I should win the Easterns.”

Bryant possesses more of a vocalflair than his friend
and partner in quickness.

"Wrestling is constant pushing and pulling by your whole
body. Its a head on. one—on—one confrontation—you against
one guy. If you're good. you know you're tough.

“You can’t depend on anyone else. If you win, you are
the best dude,” he said, as a smile took command of his
face. '

Undoubtedly. if all the grapplers were to be questioned'‘.‘‘'‘’'_‘

similar statements would be recorded. For wrestlers seem ‘to
be an uncanny breed. in search of this something. Perhaps
the respect Rodney Dangerfield has never found.

Seemingly. wrestlers are a playful bunch. They will
bump foreheads: lock their hands on the opponent's neck:
and nonchallantly buckfor an attacking position. Whe they
find it this weekend. the probable sellout crowd will react.
And. that should make Chatman very happy.

The Pitt swimmers. in their quest for a winning season. will have
to beat the Carnegie-Mellon Tartans and Youngstown Penguins at 2
o'clock tomorrow at the Trees Hall pool.

11 the Cats win against both teams. they Will have the first winning
season in nine years for the mermen and will have the only winning sea-

son of any winter sport at Pitt.

The Penguins sport some very good swimmers. among them Mark
Wadd. who swims both the 500 and 1.000-yard freestyle. Jim liowell
will have 'his hands full in the distance events and can only hope for
some help from Jerry O’Leary if he is in shape for the meet.

Jim Tatsch swims the 50 and 100-yard freestyle for Youngstown

WalIace’s best in that evnet.

‘ ‘and has done 22.2 seconds in the 50-yardevent, a time equal to Mark

The Penguins also feature a breaststroker trom lsrael by the name
of Ayi Werhudia who will be trying to upset John Templin. who now
has his last chance to qualify for the NCAA championships as he has
already qualified for the Easterns. Templin has come as close as one

second to the required time of 2:15.

The team should find no trouble and very little competition from
the ’l‘artans and only moderate competition from the Youngstown team.

“We have had a good season and I feel that swimming is definitely
on the upswing here at Pitt,” remarked Coach Bradshaw. “This year’s
team has broken every freshman record that had previously existed
and has also broken seven varsity records, and those more than once.”

of qualifying for the i\'CAA's. He has come close once before. missing

the cutoff by five points. >

“Jack Garrow has been working very hard,” commented diving
coach Al Coffey, “Jack and Jeff Miller have both been excellent_for us

The outcome of this weekend
could be crucial for the Pitt track
team. Two groups will leave Pitts-
burgh: one heading for the Na-
tional AAL7‘s at New York‘s Madi-
son Square Garden and one group
going to the Ohio State Relays at
Ohio State University.

Billy Rea. Chuck Mozingo. and
Rich Jackson will be going to the
National AAU's with head coach
Jim Banner. Rea will compete in
his speciality. the long jump.
Ranked sixth in the world. Rea is
expected to be among the top
three finishers. Definite compe-
tition for the trackster is Randy
Williams. Olympic champion in
the long jump.

Mozingo and Jackson will be
competing in the 600-yard dash.

The top track and field athletes
in the country will be competing
at the Garden.

"Not only collegians but Olym-

pians will be competing." com— ‘

merited assistant coach Don Mol-
lenauer.

This willbe Rea‘s second ap-

pearance at the AAL'~’s; this is

Jackson's and Mozingo's first ap-
pearance. Placing in the finals
could possibly earn them a berth
in the US-USSR indoor meet this
year.

Ohio State being the last oppor-
tunity to qualify for the NCAA’s
and obtain good seating for the
IC4A’s next weekend, makes this
also an important meet.

Women CymnastsL0se,° Men Face PSU

by VICKEY VETERE

Saturday the Pitt women gymnasts encounter- V

ed their second loss of the season at the hands of
Slippery Rock. The final scores were Slippery
Rock 86.50 and Pitt 78.90.

Slippery Rock. renown for its overall athletic
prowess. is ranked third in all of Pennsylvania in
women's gymnastics. Clarion is currently number
one and West Chester holds the number two position.

The first event at Saturday's meet was vault-
ing and Slippery Rock captured all three places.
However, the .fourth spot went to Pitt‘s Holda
Jones who scored 7.60 on her front handspring. Her
teammate Anne Monahan came in fifth. scoring

7.35 on a layout stoop vault. Thus at the end of the

vaulting event it was Slippery Rock 24.50 and Pitt
21.75. ' 0
0n the uneven parallel bars, Pitt’s Donna De-

Marino tied for third place with Slippery Rock’sv
. Robin Bost, both scoring 6.05. First and second

places went to Slippery Rock and at the conclusion
of this event, Slippery Rock had 19.90 to Pitt’s

17.20.

Losing by about five points at the hallway
mark. Pitt showed more strength during the meets
second half. On the balance beam. DeMarino
captured first place with a 7.70.0 Slippery Rock
took second and third places but Monahan came
in fourth with a score of 6.10.

The final event again showed DeMarino on
top with a fantastic 8.20 on her floor exercise
which is DeMarino‘s strongest event. Again
Slippery Rock managed to take both second and
third places.

In view of -their loss, Pitt’s coach, Gail DiCicco
said, “We didn’t win, but we felt like we won. Slip-
pery Rock’s team has so much more experience
than us. Any time we’ve ever gone against them,
we’ve gone down hard. But this time we were clear-
ly in the race.

DiCicco also pointed out that “even though
many of my girls didn't place. their scores were
good back-up scores. They helped greatly to add
points to our total for the meet so that we only lost
by seven points." . ‘-

Pitts gymnastics team. still in search of their first victory of the sea-
son. will attempt to get it tomorrow when Coach Warren Neiger's

charges do battle with the Penn State Nittany Lions at University Park.

Chances for the Pitt gymmen to pull off a victory are slim. as Penn
State has one on the finest gymnastic squads in the East. ln a recent
meet against Southern Connecticut. the Lions suffered a heartbreaking
163.80-163.45 defeat. Pitt hasn‘t broken 120 yet this season. so the Penn
Staters will probably prevail.

The Pitt gymnasts record stands at 0-8, and the only remaining

match after tomorrow’s is a week from then, when Pitt travels to West
Point to face the Cadets of Army.

The Eastern Intercollegiate gymnastic tournament takes place on

March 9 and 10 at Temple. but it is doubtful that Pitt will be sending

anybody to that tourney.

Dick Pribis and Lee Lilly continue to perform impressively for
the gymnasts. but the same old story. lack of depth. continues to plague
them. Pitt was hoping for a big recruiting season. but the budget cuts
will hamper this drive.
