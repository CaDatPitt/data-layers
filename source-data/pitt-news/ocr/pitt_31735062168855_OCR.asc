Tried Sex Lately?

Where did you learn about sex? On the ‘street corner? In

an alley way? Or, on the back seat of a car?

Are your ideas still foggy on the subject of sex. If they are,
maybe the Symposium on Sex and Sexuality can clear them up.
The forum begins tomorrow, and runs through Saturday with

conferences and films.

     A How About Drugs?

Ever tried marijuana? Ever meet anyone that has? Would

you like to know what it feels like to smoke “grass”?

Take a look at page 16 for the full details in today’s Pitt

News.

If you care to find out, take a look at pages seven through.
ten in today’s issue. There are six stories on those pages that‘
deal with everything from personalusers of drugs to" the crim- __
inal aspects of the law. . ~ ' '

significant social benefit and of such na-

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor
Dick Gregory, comedian, civil rights ad-
vocate, and now’ presidential candidate‘ run-
ning on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket,
had ‘a few pertinent words for all last night at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“On my flight here,” Gregory began, “I
was trying to get some sleep, when this white
cat sitting next to me tried to strike up a con-
verstation. The only thing I had against this
was that all he wanted to talk about was
black progress in America. This seemed silly
to me because the biggest breakthrough for

the Negro took place in Texas last year. We“ I

got our first colored hurricane, Hurricane
Beulah.”

Gregory’ then "talked. about heart trans-

plants. “‘Many people ask me about black

- power,” said Gregory. “Anyone who knows

anything about the.;South African heart trans-
plant, knows that the transplanted black heart is the
only one that is working right. Anyway, everyone
knows that all the white man needs is a change of
heart.”

Gregory did say though, that the last thing that
the black man wanted the white man to think was

that they are going to start using the black_ man_

for spare parts. “But I’m not against heart trans-
plants,” he said. “I’n just against all transplants

that you can hide. I would like to see a white cat -
._ with a black foot. I bet that he would have a lot of

trouble at the beach.”

“Many people think that if the black people of
the U.S. were to take over the country tonight, that
we would make slaves out of all the white people
by morning,” said Gregory. “They know that this

is to soon.” But Gregory said it would be actually

 

' Called

 

“the most’ ambitious”

 

impossible for the black population to take over
the country. “Why it would take us two and one-
half years just to teach them howto eat watermel-
on right,” he quipped. “And there are so many of
them he continued that they could pick all the cot-
ton in two days, and then just sit around the other
363 days. ” .

Rodd Exposes Retarding Political Mechanisms

William Rodd. former execu-
tive director of the Neighbor-
hood Center Association. exposed
the political mechanizations that
are stunting the growth of the
Poverty Program in Pittsburgh
in a lunch hour talk Oct. 8.

Speaking on The Politics of
Poverty, Rodd. who terms him-
self the "original campus rad-
ical." lamented the situation
in Pittsburgh politics. “There is

no city more poverty—stricken
in its political aspects than Pitts-
burgh. in the sense of talent. re-
sources and what it has to offer."
he began.

Rodd took the problem back
30 years, to the ascension of Da-
vid L. Lawrence as mayor. “Da-
vid L. Lawrence had all the good
attributes of Mayor Daley." he
said.

“In his alliance with Mellon

(banker). Lawrence worked a
politics of consensus, the like
of which has never been seen in
the country. He had the unions
in his pocket, and Pittsburgh
is essentially a union town. He
had liberals—the ADA. He had
everything that really counted
for politics except the poor peo-
ple.”

According to Rodd. this situa-

tion still prevailed when Mayor
Barr assumed office.

“There was and is no place
for the untrained poor in this city.
The unemployment rate is
22.2‘; in ghetto areas as con-
trasted to an overall 3.1%." he
revealed.

Things came to a head when

_Barr decided to take a tour of the

poverty areas. His
was less than cordial.

reception

“Barr took a tour of the ‘tot

lots'." explained Rodd. ‘Tot
lots’ are essentially small
squares between two dilapidated
buildings. strewn with glass.

which the people clean up. Then
the city moves in about $200
worth of Sears-Roebuck equipment
for the kids."

Several consequences were
born because of this incident.
The Poverty Program contract
was cut off. An attempt was made
to oust Rodd.

The Green Amendment was a
further result.
that the Poverty Program had to
be placed under public manage-
ment of some kind.

“Barr made every effort to take
over and politicalize the pro-.
gram." evaluated Rodd.

The casual speaker offered a‘ e 

few more reasons for the failure

of the Poverty Program in the 

city.

“There are too many strings 

attached to the funds." he said.

“There's a need for private mon-.

ey.

“Another thing, and will the I _'
press please quote me, is. that the‘ 

program is subverted by sub-

versive types like myself,” he

said ironically.

“Nobody knew until it was too

late what we were doing. The pro-
g_ram became a vehicle for a few

subversive radicals to use for’ I

their own purposes."

And now what may happen?

“I think there's no answer other

than revolution and I predict a
violent revolution." Rodd said
solemnly with a certain tone of
dread in his voice.

“I hope it's minimal and short-
lived. But. I expect a revolution.

‘I'm sure we‘re going to have it."

a Secret Research

The word secret resea.rch_has sparked a gre.'(i:t1deal)_of
controversy and confrontation in recent times. At 0 um ia,

I  the local chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society

(SDS) fought against that university’s secret research ties

, with the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA). This was a
3 V minor droplet in a sea of frustration that caused the rebellion.

It is argued that grants for secret research dirty the pure

-; atmosphere of academic freedom. Secret research inhibites

the objective academic pursuit of truth. And one very basic
reason for this flaw of secret research 1S that its results are
not upheld to public accountability. Thus papers and other
academic andjpolemic means of communication and criti-
cism are ruled out. .

The problems and the catastrophic results of government

7 I, sponsored secret research can be vividly pictured by a brief

description of the ill-fated Project Camelot.
Camelot was sponsored by the Army’s Special Office of

if I V. Operations Research (SORO). As in most government spon-

sored grants, the sponsoring agency (SORO) laid the founda-
tion for the research. SORO set the research guidelines and
objectives. Thus the research was channeled in a certain di-
rection. Above all, the results of the research was to immedi-
ately become classified information.

The objectives of Camelot were to asses the potential

for internal war (a euphemism)in developing nations, and to
identify the actions a government could take to relieve rev-

  o_lutionary conditions. The United States Army was notably
; the sponsor of this research._

The first area of field work involved with the Camelot
research was Latin America. One member of the University
faculty, not originally consulted about the project asked to

T . travel to Chile in the quest for information. There he met

with Chilean officials who found out he was not working on

.independent research, but was investigating for the United

States Army.
The outcome of this very delicate situation almost caus-

 ed the United States a serious diplomatic set back—the cessa-
I tion of diplomatic’ relations with Chile. The Chileans felt the
' United States was attempting to subvert their government.

After some careful diplomatic maneuvers, calm was re-
stored. All of this heartache was a result of secret research
sponsored by a government source. ‘

Even if Camelot would have continued, the research re-

 sults would be highly questionable, for the scholars who

consented agreed on the rigid guidelines set by SORO. In
short, the scholars involved with Camelot were being used by

I the government. This certainly isn’t the role of the scholar
‘ in the University community.

Secret research subverts the tenets of the academic com-
munity. It distorts and bends the objective scientific founda- '

  tions upon which scholarly research is based. A community
;:-_j; V  dedicated to the principles of learning becomes a community
~ :“'of hypocrisy when secret research grants and interlocking

government agencies become active ingredients in this com-

*'."munity’s chemistry. Secret research should not be allowed
 on this campus, and we are glad the Faculty Senate has
' taken steps to kill this terminal virus. ‘

From The End Of The Bar

‘Watch Those Old Fools’--Gregory;
But Dick, Give Them Some Credit

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Tell me Dick.
Tell me about the niggers.

Tell me about the black niggers. the white nig-
gers, the political niggers. and tell me who the new
nigger is going to be. Tell me Dick.

Tell me what’s wrong with this country. Tell me
about the immoralist moralists. the political politi-
clans, and the established establishment. Tell me
Dick, because I want to know
what to do. I want to know how
you can change the system. I
want to know why I can’t get an '
answer for a question which be-
gins with why this. or why that.

I want to know why Dick.

You stand before 3000 people, 
and you talk; you stand before 10.-
000 people. and you rage; and
you stand before 100.000 people
and you tell it like it is. But Dick
baby, why can‘t you be President.

Why Dick‘?

You tell the truth. You tell it
like it is. but why can't you be President? You lash
out at those damn wrongs. and plead for change.
You lash out at those damn whites. and plead for
them to open their eyes. And you lash out at those
damn old fools, and plead for them because they
have forgotten about those millions of babies born
after their second war on this world. ‘

LIES

    

They've forgotten, and Dick. you haven‘t. But
why can’t you be President? Why?

You say those corrupt old fool politicians have
used all the tricks in their bag. No more tricks, you
say. And you say keep an eye on those old fools,
otherwise they’ll program us to go along with the
system.

But without saying it Dick, you’re telling me

that those old fools are the new niggers. They’re

what you might call the Last of the Niggers. They
started it. The cycle made the cycle, and now Dick,
they’re going to finish it.

But don’t let them go without giving them some
credit. Credit them for some things Dick; take your-
self for example. ‘

If it wasn’t for them, you wouldn’t have had to
shine shoes when you were seven in a St. Louis bil-
liard parlor where the white customers used to rub
your head for good luck.

You wouldn’t have had that two dollars you
spent seven years ago on Christmas Eve, when you
bought three pounds of ground meat for your wife
and kids. You wouldn’t have had to fast, lose weight,
or grow a beard in protest over the Vietnam war.

And if it wasn’t for those old fools, you would-
n’t be running for President. You’d still be standing
on a stage making white people laugh at themselves,
for a measly $100,000 a year.

So why not agree, those old fools deserve the
credit.

After all, even if you never become President,
respect those old fools. They are a dying breed; the
last of the American Nigger.

Dear Friends: ' '

For centuries man has sought
political, economic and religious
solutions to his problems. These
attempted solutions have been at
times helpful and at times harm-

_ful; in any event they usually

were directed toward symptoms
of man’s problems rather than to
the real source and shape of his
conscience. We propose to do
something which is directed to
the conscience of mankind.

We are going to acquire a ship
that can transport approximately
300 people’ and sail around the
world as a gesture of Peace and
Universal Brotherhood. In order
to this we have formed a non-pro-
fit corporation to organize this
voyage. We have no affiliations
with any political. social. or re-
ligious organizations. We will de-
pend solely upon mankind for sup-
port.

Perhaps you would like to be
one with us. If you cannot come
you might like to help us. There
is much to be done. '

WE WILL try to get a govern-
- ment, ship ~—'— perhaps? one of .. the

 

moth-balled Liberty ships — and
adapt her for our purposes. We
will change a “Ship of War” into
a “Ship, of Peace.” The ship will
be paintedyin beautiful colors by
artists. On her sides she will car-
ry messages of Peace and Good-
will from anyone who wishes to
send them. In the course of pre-
paring our ship, we will prepare
ourselves for the journey. Before
as, well as during the voyage, it is
planned that seminars be held to
explore and express the attitude

of Peace, non-violence and love’

through discussion and medita-
tion.

None of the persons aboard our
ship will be “passengers.” Every-
one will have some sort of duty,
however samll it may seem to be.
We shall all have an interesting
and enlightening experience.

When our ship is ready we will
Christen her the “Mankind." It is
a good name—for the whole pur-
pose of our trip will be to express
the attitude that we are all one.
a seemingly reluctant brother-
hood. with only one world to live
in. We are convinced that our one
and only hope for mankind to ‘sur-
vive is by love expressed through
a gentle attitude and kindness
shown to our brothers.

WE INTED to leave San Fran-
cisco in June. 1969. and go to
many ports. We will sail first to
Hiroshima. There we will say that
we are sorry _ for the terrible
bombing that happened. All of us.
including the Japanese. are re-
sponsible, for allowing it to hap-
pen: and our apology will be from
mankind. not just from America.

By going to Hiroshima, we will
call attention to the specter of hy-
drogen bomb warfare, a specter
we have all but forgotten except
for a nagging fear in the back of
our minds.

Hiroshima will remind us of

the possibility of nuclear holo- :.

caust; but it can also be a begin-

_,ning place for a reaffirmation of
the nature of God iii;,jrnan.,_Theije,-'

  

  

We are entering a “New Age”
for mankind. It will not be an age
of conflict in politics. economics,
and religion, but an age of “Uni-
versality“ in which we realize
that all men are brothers, that the
greatest joy in life is loving one
another. and that we can never
benefit at the expense of another.
In this age we will have no cause
to fear or mistrust anyone. This
will come about as we overcome
our doubts, guilt, fears and sel-

fishness. These barriers separat-'
ing man will be removed aboard _

our ship. We hope this will be
true for people all over the world.
We want everyone to identify
with our trip. and what we are
trying to create. a pure gesture of
love.

AFTER OUR ship leaves Hiro-
shima, we will go where we think
we can best express our theme of
brotherhood; but we will consi-
der the savety and well being of
everyone on the ship as well as
the people in the ports of call. We
would like to stop in China. Viet-
nam. Africa. India, and Europe.

As we mentioned before we
plan to leave in June. 1969. If you

-wish to go with us, or to contri-

bute in any way, please write to
Mankind . . —. Big Sur, California
93920. Those who wishto go with
us will receive a letter explaining
all’ of ‘the details. If any school
organization or interested goup of
individuals wishes to take on as a
project helping us in this endeav-
or, we will be pleased to send a
speaker from our group to talk
with you.

We will be supported entirely
by donations from passengers and
others who wish to contribute
with their messages. We are will-
ing to take passengers who cannot
afford their own expenses. How-
ever, since we are funded only by

not be fully revealed. Rare occasions may
arise when the Chancellor feels that some de-
parture from this principle may be necessary.
Such a departure must be made known to the
Faculty Senate immediately upon its approval.

An individual faculty member will be free
to undertake classified projects as a consul-
tant within limits laid down by University
policy on consulting.

These additions were devised because the

1 faculty feels that “the primary responsibility

of a university is the discovery and dissemin-
ation of knowledge in an environment of free
and open inquiry, or upon his right to dissem-
inate his findings is inconsistent with that re-
sponsibility and abhorrent to the scholarly
community.” .

The additions will supplement a report
published by Chancellor Wesley Posvar last
March 15. The report, entitled “De Facto Po-
llCleS on Secret Research,” also advocates
free and open inquiry. Restrictions on re-

‘searchers and their inquiries will not be tol-

erated.

Upon occasion, the Chancellor feels that
the University may be asked to perform serv-
ices of importance to the public that may re-
quire access to secret sources of information

. or which may necessitate restriction on the

publication of some research.

Reference to secret resources is sometimes
not inconsistent with academic values, ac-
cording to the Chancellor’s policy. In some
cases it may be desirable for the researcher
to be informed on secret materials crucial to
his own publishable research. In denying the
researcher such access his freedom of inquiry
would be inhibited.

Restrictions on publications are also ob-
jectionable. But, they may be tolerated in cer-
tain instances when the social value of the ac-
tivity is substantial and the impact on aca-
demic values is minimal. '

The policy statement cautions that the so-
cial benefits of performing public services
must be weighed carefully against their in-
hibitory effects upon academic freedom. The
researcher himself has the initial and primary
responsibility for decisions of this type and
should always bear in mind the conflict be-
tween restrictions and candid discourse.

Certain policies will be followed in im-
plementing these policies.

Supervisory personnel will decide if the
research is clearly related to the educational
mission of the University or of significant so-
cial benefit and can be effectively performed
by no other agency except an institution of
higher learning.

1 t’s Been ‘Ruled Out’

Any classified government research con-
tracts must be approved expressly by the
Chancellor. He will report periodically to the
Faculty Senate on this subject.

The University will end government con-
tract restrictions on the distribution of infor-
mation.

Non-governmental agencies or businesses
requiring restrictions on release of informa-
tion will require approval of a Dean or Direc-
tor who will advise the Chancellor fully on
such arrangements.

The University will not knowingly re-
search or provide other services as a front for
undisclsed sponsors.

Academic credit will be given only for re-

search that is freely publishable. A degree

thesis may not be classified or its disclosure
limited in any respect.

Only research that is freely publishable

will beconsidered in passing on faculty ad-

vancement or tenure.

All University secret research projects will
hereby _be discontinued. According to a re-
port by the Chancellor, five such projects
were currently taking place. All have been
presently discontinued save one, which is

pending a final investigation and report. It‘

will be ended within the very near future.

In The Pitt News story published last Nov.
15, it was revealed that many secret research
projects were being maintained by the Uni-
versity at 1776 Massachusetts Ave., Washing-
ton, .D. C. At the time, the faculty had no_
knowledge of this activity.

The building, owned by the late Dr. Ed-
ward Litchfield, former University Chancel-
lor, was originally known as the University. of
Pittsburgh Ordinance Research Staff. In 1963,
it became a privateinstitution, called Govern-
ment Agencies Institute. This staff worked
with contracts from military command. They
are responsible for technical writing, historic-
al research papers, and manuals of weapons.
There work included everything from “fuses
to missiles,” according to a knowledgeable
faculty member. Approximately 20 per cent
of their operations dealt with chemical-bio-
logical warfare. Another 40 per cent were
classified.

Classified research, itself, means security
clearance for all persons involved. This proce-
dure allows the government to require po-
litical orthodoxy as a criteria for employ-
ment. The faculty opposes such clearance at a
University unless certain researchers them-
selves are willing to subject themselves to
this procedure.

Gregory said that the first thing he would do if
elected, would be to paint the white house black,
. ring all (the boys home from Vietnam, and send
‘Ii.’B.”J. over to Vietnam with only a barbecue gun.

"He said that he would have Eartha Kitt to call
him -everyday, to harrass him by saying, “We're
working on peace feelers.” “I knew that L. B. J.
wasn't going to change when he was released from
' ‘e_'hosp_ital after his operation,” Gregory said.
With millions of people watching on their televi-
oiis, he reached down and showed the scar on his
stgmach from his operation. Its just lucky that he
iIp’t have a hemorroid operation.”

;'iMr-. Gregory then got very serious before the
packed audience in the Field House. “You young.
people of today are the most morally committed,
dicated group ever to exist in this country,” he
id. “You are the ones who will have to solve to-
d,a"y’s problems.iAnd the sad thing,” he continued,
*“"is"that you had nothing to do with these problems
the first place. But either you solve them or they
willisolve you.” _ 1

"Gregory said that the number one problem in
_e';:U.S} is not air pollution, but moral pollution.
"This nation is insane, and it is up to the young
people of thiscountry to restore its sanity.

_“-Y'ou.witnessed what happened in Chicago,’A’ he
said. “The sad thing is that this country is so insane,
hat since it happened they have been trying to tell
you that you didn’t see what you saw on television.
The frightening thing is,” he continued, “that there
are__' so, many people ready to believe this. Those
ids ‘that participated in the Chicago incident,
ere outnumbered six to one. I think, whenever
hefstrongest country in the world can outnumber

iiation better-than we did in Chicago, then we had

emphasized. , ,

Gregory said that he does not advocate the des-

truction of capitalism in the U. S. “Capitalism-

should be put in its right place,” he said, “and that
is behind the constitution, and not in front of it.”
He said that the trouble with today’s leaders is that
they put the emphasis on property rights and not
human rights. “But I do agree with the idea of
shooting looters to kill, only I think we should make
it retroactive and put the gun in the Indians hand
first.

“If democracy is as good as we say that it is,”
he pointed out. “then why in hell- are we going all
over the world trying to ram it down folks throat?
Anything good enough, ‘people will try to steal,”
he went on. .

Gregory touched on most of the problems that

are plaguing mankind. “The only way the black '_

problem in America is going to be solved is for the

‘ government to create an atmosphere were black
folks will trust white folks. To create this atmos-
phere, the U.S. must help out red brothers, our
Puerto Rican and Mexican brothers, and our Jew-
ish brothers. Only then,” Gregory concluded can
theigovernment then turn to the black man and say.
“Okay brother, please come in and let us together
solve your problem.”

Man had used natural substances
for over two thousandyears in order to
create a feeling of well-being, to es-
cape problems of ‘everyday life, and as
a part of religious ritual. Perhaps the
most widely used of these substances
has been alcohol, produced by ferment-
ing grapes or grain.

But next to alchol, the most popular
gsubstance acting upon the mind has
V been the dried leaf of the Indian hemp

plant, marijuana. The hemp plant, Can-

nabis sativa, grows wild through most
of the world. To some, smoking mari-
juana heightens the senses. Others,
when smoking for the first time, are re-
— pelled by the bitter taste and hot smoke
of burning marijuana. Some people may
even be allergic to marijuana.
, MARIJUANA is perhaps more com-
‘monly refereed to in this country by its
nicknames; grass, pot, Mary Jane, or
: possibly dope. It is smoked most often
in the form of cigarettes “reefers” or
?“joints”) which can be made by re-
moving the tobacco from a non-filter
‘cigarette and replacing it with grass.-
“Some users smoke with a water pipe,
'-which serves to dull the bite of the
smoke.
_' To be sure, pot is grown in this
country, but the best quality comes
from Mexico where it sells for about
two dollars for a kilogram. By the time
'the_Mexican crop is smuggled across
the Rio Grande, and often adulterated
with oregano in the process, the price
has risen to about $275 per kilo. In
Pittsburgh, depending on who’s selling,
‘grass may cost anywhere from $10 to
$20 per ounce. «

i There is another product of the In-
dian hemp plant known as hashish, or
hash. Hash is the collected sap of the
plant and contains approximately, 100
"_"til'I'l€S the halluciogenic. or “high-pro-
f}'.ducing,” property of ordinary grass.
' One gram of hash usually sells for
about $20 in Pittsburgh.

W One of the most controversial topics in the country today is the one which
'11 regards the use of the hemp plant Cannabis Sativa: the mind-expanding drug
marijuana. This controversy has recently come to light because of the tremen-
h_ dously increasing amount of people, of all ages and backgrounds, who now use
; V the drug. and the fact that marijuana has made a seemingly ubiquitous appear-
‘ : ance on almost every major college campus in the United States.

Because it cannot be denied that marijuana is indeed making an impact on
the various aspects of university life, it should be seen how this affects stu-
V-dents on this campus. To do this a surevey was taken of a cross section‘ of, stu-

dents, all of whom have smoked marijuana. The students were asked to relate
 their experiences with the drug, and to give their -over all opinions on the use
' e and control of marijuana.

People who are not informed usually associate
the smoking of marijuana with people who have long
hair and sit around in "dimly lit rooms and pass a .

 marijuana cigarette, or “joint,” around a table. This

’ A is as far from the truth as the misbelief that connects

marijuana smoking and the use of heroin. Here, as

in any other place around the country, the people

who smoke marijuana cannot be determined by

means of appearance, social background, or other

‘ misused, antiquated classifications. The fact is that

so many people are using this drug that if any at-

_ temp of classification would be made. then it would

 have to be said that marijuana users would be clean

Drugs—a pregnant word. To some people, drugs

mean substances obtainable at the local pharmacy" to
cure numerous ills. To others, the word drugs con-
notes a ghetto dweller shooting heroin to es-cape des-
pair. But to the average student, drugs connote mari-
juana, LSD, STP, or perhaps hashish. Most students
are aware that there is drug usage on this campus.

the. Pitt News will ‘attempt
to document some aspects of this usage, Within the
supplement are statements from students who have
used drugs-, statements from students who are op-
posed to their use, and statements fro.m a psychologist
and a narcotics agent on drug use.

The Pitt News feels that in light of the available
evidence the so-called drug laws are far t_oo strict

stances such as marijuana is a decision that must be

of wa-ys and is smoked in places rang-

On the average the University student,
" who has smoked marijuana. has done so
for two years, and now smokes about once
 a week. Of those surveyed 50 per cent said
they haven’t tried any other drug besides

about ten per cent of this latter half use
these drugs with any type of regularity.

MOST OF THE students interviewed
came from a conservative. middle class
family background. All were brought up
in one of the organized religions. but all
of them felt that the best way to approach
religion was on an individual and person-
al basis. Of those surveyed. only the par-
ents of ten per cent knew that they had

Marijuana was not illegal in this
country until the 1930s, when, with

prodding from the liquor and tobacco

industries, Congress enacted the Mari-
juana Tax Act which made possession
of marijuana a- felony unless a fifty dol-

Half of the students belonged to either a
fraternity or sorority. while all of them
had interests involving music. poetry. art.
and philosophy. or as one girl put it. “The
same old cultural bag."

Most of them felt that the experiences
one has with marijuana were on an indi-
vidual basis. but agreed that there are bas-

or five years imprisonment. The vari-
ous states followed suit, making mari-
juana possession a state crime as well.

, There have been numerous studies
made on the effects of marijuana and

, the conclusion of the objective surveys

has been that marijuana does not lead
to heroin addiction nor does it cause
insanity. Instead, it produces a feeling
of euphoria and- well being: the overall
effect is very similar to that of alcohol.
Dr. James Goddard, former director of
Federal Food and Drug Administration
recently concurred with the above opin-
ion. But Goddard resigned under pres-
sure and the penalties for marijuana
usage remain. '

OTHER DRUGS are used by Uni-
versity students but their usage is much
less common than that of marijuana.
LSD, or lysergic acid, was discovered
by a Swiss chemist during the second
World War. According to its users. LSD
produces a feelingof deep inner per-
ception and reveals the true nature of
the.user’s mind. Users say’LSD is safe;

their opponents insist its use can cause

insanity or birth-defects in user’s chil-

' dren. LSD is used by University stu-

dents but in quantities nowhere near
that of marijuana. Interesting enough,
possession of LSD is only a misde-
manor.

Other drugs found on this campus
are similar in effect to L SD. STP,
DMT, and psylocibin are examples of
these. There is some usage also of the
amphetamine group, prescription drugs
which can either keep a user awake to
study for a test or, in larger quantities,
make a user very high. But marijuana
is the most common drug on this cam-
pus and the following aiiticles will con-
centrate on. it use. '

.-ls Told to The Pitt News

Drugs. like sex, have been over-played and over
condemned. They have become forbidden fruits and
forbidden fruits are always tempting. Movies, maga-
zines and newspapers have by condemning them and
constantly writing about them, made them sound too
exciting and too appealing. Everyone wants to try
them. We did. and found the drugs to be greatly
over—rated.

Our non-straight friends told us how fantastic
grass was. “You can get an intellectual high,” they
told us. “It makes you really think—really see reality.”
For us, this was not the case. Instead, it detracted
from reality and made us lose touch with ourselves.

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor

Not the stereotyped law enforcement
officer—overweight, tobacco-chewing. non-
intellectual+40 year old. Paul DiMaio. Al-
legheny County narcotics agent is intelli-
gent, aware, and hip to the local drug
scene. I

DiMaio, nonetheless. is what is com-
monly known as a “nark." one of the men
whose duty it is to “bust" drug offenders.
But. he does not envision his job as one _
who punishes abusers. Sincerely interest-
ed in cure and prevention. DiMaio cons-
tantly educateshimself and others on the
effects of drugs. At an age when mostmen
have long finished their educations, Di-
Maio continues to attend night school and
read information pertaining to his work.
Frequently. he takes the podium to lecture
to youth groups and parents.

THE BULK OF the agent's information

 

— Marijuana affected each of us differently. It was
Jennifer’s first experience and it took her long to
think she was stoned. Faye had smoked’ before but
it had never affected her quite this much. She says:
“Right after we started on the second joint, it hit me.
I felt just like,I was‘ floating. Everything in the room
was blurred. I didn’t feel happy or sad. In fact, emo-
tionally I was numb.” A ' A

“I guess I was really stoned,”,Faye continues-,“‘I
kept getting farther and farther away from reality. I
felt like I was falling down a bottomless hole. My
tongue seemed glued to the roof of my mouth and I

couldn’t talk. My whole body was shaking. I had’

smoked before and enjoyed it, butthis time, I was
scared to death.” ‘ ’

Grass may make some people thin-k more clearly
but it didn’t do that for us. At the time we felt less
inhibited and were able to make many profound
statements about the world. But the next day, we real-
ized that we really hadn’t said anything at all.

Reality was ‘destroyed. We both felt that we had‘
lost touch with ourselves. We were no longer individ-

' uals, but people playing the role-of—people—at—a-po_t-

party. It was an artifical thrill. Reality wasn’t
changed no matter what illusions we saw or felt. Ad-
mitedly, some people may get a release from this.
We felt that we had lost-those hours from our lives

Sex is also wasted with pot. It’s hard to enjoy an-
other person’s body if you feel that you’re outside of
your own. Stimulation and desire (at least, in our ex-
perience) seemed to be destroyed.

We are not condemning the use of marijuana.
Our bad experience with it could have been caused
by the people we were with, the weather, or any
number of things. We both feel that it is an escape
from reality, but, perhaps no more sothan alcohol,
day-dreaming or television. We may even try it
again, unless we have something better to do.

on Pittsburgh drug users is obtained from
informers. “The informers themselves are

usually addicts.“ DiMaio stated. They

give us information and in return. we give
them a lighter sentence." DiMaio admit-
ted to The Pitt News that some of these
agents are students on local university
campuses.

“Drug usage is definitely on the in-
crease in Pittsburgh." he stressed. “It's no
longer just marijuana. but the hard drugs:
LSD. methedrine. cocaine. and heroin
that are being used.“

"Drugs are being taken in ‘damn near
every school. high schools included." Di-
Maio asserts. College usage in specific. he
pointed out. is restricted for the most part
to pot-smoking. "Other users just fade
out." They get so doped up that they_ are
unable to keep up with their studies and
soon flunk out of school. A hard-core user
cannot last in school for any length of
time," V W .

   

I-‘would ‘be "mi

 

possible to estimate thenumber of drug-

users on the city's local campuses.

He mentioned that three or four arrests _

have taken place atthis university. There
have not been too many, more arrests at
other local universities either. Although

DiMaio claims-to have “tons of informa-'
tion" on college drug abusers. he had not

as yet been able to prosecute many of
them. “

College drug usage begins with pills.
according to DiMaio. The majority of the
pills consumed are “pep" pills or barbit-
urates. Their usage on college campuses is
widespread in enabling a student to be
awake for many hours to cram for an exam.
DiMaio believes that all types of students.
even those of. the "straight" classification
devour pills upon occasion. “They think
they have a mind-expansion. but they real-
ly have a mind-destroyer." he affirms.

Barbiturates. he contends. are as dan-
gerous a

nd addicting as heroin.,Som_e users

  
   

THE NEXT RUNG on the ladder. to ad-
diction is ‘marijuana. DiMaio conjectures
that the “happy weed" is 100 times more
habit-forming than cigarettes.

He concedes the marijuna phile argu-
ment that pot is no more harmful than al-

coholic beverages. "People can handle

marijuana. but it will eventually lead them
to higher drugs." He bases this claim on

personal interviews ‘with 300‘ junkies. “who

used marijuana before graduating to hard
drugs.” '

DiMaio vigorously opposes legaliza-
tion of_ pot. “I don't condone liquor. so why
should I want this legalized ?.“

“To take marijuana. something has to
be wrong with you mentally.“ he attests.
DiMaio expressed an interesting theory on
drug addiction. “Drinking itself quite of-
ten leads to drugs." '

A (Continued from Page 8)

_, Here are some excerpts from what the
students themselves had to say about mari-
juana:

“ “DRINKING always dulls my senses
while smoking heightens them. I seem to
be aware of little insignificant things, like
droplets of rain on telephone wires. . .- . I
have a deeper feeling towards my fellow
‘ man, and always more control over what
,I.am saying and doing.”

_ “I love to smoke and go to art shows
and museumsj I can really get involved,
and I’m able to appreciate all forms of
art. . . . I think everybody’ shouldsmoke
grass, Of course, the pot you get here is
relatively weak. I smoked some ‘Black
Ganja! once and got up on one toke.”

' “Grass is the greatest physifaliand
Qmental high you can get artificially. It’s
ieuphoria. No other drug can give you the
"sense of well being that marijuana does.

Acid (LSD) is a state, where Grass is a
= high.”

“Pot is great if put in it’s propertpers-
péctive. It should be used as pleasure and
not as an escape.”

‘.‘WHEN I SMOKE it seems as if I’m
becoming one with many. I get a little
. paranoid though, and don’t want much as-
'V~sociation with people. But if I find some-
one who seems to share my own ideas I
:7'am more outgoing towards him. . . '. I
-,-think that the penalties for possessing
_.marijuana are outrageous. and I think it
vishould be eventually legalized. I'm just
wondering if we‘ are ready to legalize it
 now.”
f‘Grass always makes me more perspec-
éftive, and I never have any inhibitions or
"worries; . . . I think that the greatest ex-
perience I ever had is when I smoked pot
L and took mescaline. I was lying in bed
‘listening to records after I had gotten
3: high, when I took some cologne and spray-
red some into the room. The result was
 amazing. It seemed that somehow I could
"break down the one smell of the cologne

down is nothing more than the preserva-
tion of antiquated laws substantiated by
imaginary ideas. I must give the liquor
industry their due by congratulating them
on their unprecedented insight, when, way
back in 1937, they discovered that the
poor, lower class people had quit drinking
the booze they couldn’t afford and turned
to grass. It must have been quite a shock
. to them to even think what might happen
if more and more people started to turn on.
Luckily though they were saved’ by that
‘get famous quick,’ self-proclaimed evan-
gelist of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,
Harry J. Anslinger. who unremittingly
crusaded for the outlawing of that ‘killer’
drug marijuana.”

“ANSLINGER MAY have succeeded
in making a name for himself, but he cer-
tainly didn’t succeed in stopping the use
of marijuana. In spite of all the laws en-
acted against it, it is in it’s most wide-
spreadusage today. Marijuana is nothing
more than a harmless, mind-inducing drug
with no disastrous effects as associated
with alcohol. So if anybody tells you that
pot is a powerful narcotic in which lurks
murder, rape, insanity and death, then

into many different ones as the mood or
tone of the music changed. It was beauti-
ful becuase I could also associate the dif-

ferent smells with different kinds of flow-

ers. . . . A little later I somehow began
looking for a religious experience. God
appeared to be a glowing light set high
on a pedestal. . I was struggling to
reach the light and God but I never made
it because I was thinking so many

thoughts at once that I couldn’t concen-H

trate on one particular idea.”

“I THINK MARIJUANA should be
legalized because it is not a crime that
should necessitate all the time and effort
by law enforcement agencies which could

be waged against real crime. . . . Actually

it should be legalized from an aesthetic
standpoint. . . . You enjoy a broader aware-
ment of your mind, because marijuana is a
catalyst _to bring out thoughts you haven’t
mulled over before . 

“Smoking Grass for me is comparable
to a dissociation with what is actually hap-
pening. I feel I am two persons, one who
is interacting with people and events
around him, while the other is watching
and interpreting all of his actions. This
way I can achieve a greater interpretation
and understanding of my actions, and see
why I do some of the things I do in my
relations with other people. v

ALTHOUGH MOST of these excerpts
were approached along the same line of
thought, they were each diversified in
their own way. The area in which the
most agreement and repetition occured,
however. was that of the laws regarding
the use and possession of marijuana.

The following statement summarizes
this view:

“It is hard for me to conceive of any
valid reason for the stringent laws against
the use of marijuan_a.WThis unequaled put-

you can be sure that they are feeding you
nothing more than pure unadulterated
bullshit.”

-“IT IS HARD to comprehend that the
possession of the stronger hallucinogenic
drugs such as LSD, are regarded as only
misdemeanors and that various aphete-
mines can be obtained through prescrip-
tion. while the use of marijuana is consi-
dered a felony and may be accompanied
by a _large fine and up to five years in
jail.” '

“Laws such as these which are totally
alienated from the facts, tend to be some
of the causes that youth is now disillu-

sioned with the established society. I sin-

cerely feel that an official attemp to re-
valuate the present fairness of our out-

‘ dated marijuana laws, can be a great step

toward mutual understanding, and could
quite possibly be a start to bridge thegap
between the two generations.

symbol of social rebellion. con-

expressing resistance against be-

pression for a desire to expose pos-
sible irrelevance of any past judg-
ment.

and rebellion and involves a suspension of behavior directed to-

 During "an integrity crisis, the individual questions ‘the re-

to both an openness to experience and a willingness to partici-

This story is symbolic of the fear
that the drug user will eventual-
ly look at something he is not sup-
posed to look at. (In this case, the
s u n symbolizes authority. T h e
drug user was immoblized by the
responsibilities imposed on him.)

Society also fears, according to
Hill. that drugs will lead to ex-
pression of irresponsible and des-
tructive sex or agression. a fear
that shows lack of understanding
of the nature of psychedelic drugs.
It assumes that drugs bring on the
same state of consciousness as al-
cohol. Hill feels that this fear is
justified only in the respect that
the drugs do create a feeling of
personal vulnerability.

Factual Drug
Definitions ’

HALLUCINOGENS—“the mind expanding drugs.”

STP—One of the most powerful hallucigenic drugs, taken
internally it produces vividhallucinations and distortion of
reality lasting up to“ 72 hours.

LSD (Lysergic Acid’ Dithilamide(—Produces up to 12_
hour “trips” where time is distorted, reality becomes ques-
tionable and hallucinations occur. Confusion often occurs be-
cause the brain is flooded with sensory images and impulses
that are usually held back or blocked. Users find a religious
fascination with it and claim to have mystic experiences.

DMT (Dimethyl Triptalene(—A white powder, usually
smoked, about one-fifth as strong as LSD although more dan-
gerous to individual brain cells.

lHASHISH—Pollen of the marijuana plant, usually smok-
ed, producing euphoria and increased sensory awareness.

MARIJUANA——Inherently harmless form of weed, com- -
monly smoked in pipes or “joints” (thin-rolled cigarettes)
producing mild euphoria,‘ elation, increased sensory aware-

ness or sometimes a feeling of relaxation, depending on the_
user, the time and the circumstances.

AMPHETAMINES—Known as “ups” or “speed.” Used in
diet pills and as an anti-depressant. Causes pupils to dialte,

and mouth to become dry, lack of appetite and inability to

   

adjusting to senseless routine.‘

Hill cites three possible reasons‘

why an individual may experi-
ment with marijuana. Pot repre-
sents an fashionable method of re-
belling. It provides a means for
experiencing psychic adventure.
Psychedelic drugs have recently
gained national attention and no-
toriety. and the individual may be
motivated by simple curiousity.

Hill stresses that for most peo-
ple. none of these motives will
lead a person to become hung up
on drugs. He also points out that
psychedelic drugs’ as such are
morally’ neutral. that they can
serve’ as a

‘ward insigh

facilitating, agen't, to-' _
t«'into ,1,ife1if taken, ser-i- —

    

sleep.

‘ 'METH‘EDRINE——Commonly calledimeth, it is perhaps

the most powerful amphetamine, “snorted,” shot up (injected)

or taken internally it produces a “high” lasting up to 24 hours.
Metabolism is stepped up, blood pressures rises, and time
goes quickly. The time is usally spent “rapping” (establish-

ing a random report), reading, or thinking.

DEXEDRINE AND BENZEDRINE—Less powerful but
having the same effect as Methedrine. All amphetamines can

cause a physical dependency.

TRANQUILIZERS, BARBITUATES —— Includes depres-
sants, sleeping pills and pain killers, notably alcohol, secanol,
tuinol, and phenobarbitol. Produce a depressed feeling or
calm, speech is slurred and eyes become half shut. They can
become habit forming and there is always the possibilityof

an overdose resulting in death.

HARD NARCOTICS—Opium, heroin, codeine, cocaine.

Usually injected, they produce a lethargic drugged state and

decreased awareness of surroundings. User often sits in one

— Dear Mr. Jacobs:

Several weeks ago The Pitt News publilshoed a letter which
complained that Jerry Richey. was not receiving the properat—
tention in the paper that he deserved. This IS ridiculous. I
have counted his picture in the paper at least a dozen times. I
don’t know what paper that other fellow is reading.

True, Jerry Richey’s picture has appeared many times-
but always with reason. You must admit that he is the only
I really good news we have this term. In his case, there is no
p3§_sijijljty of too mucsuch possibility of too much of a good

fensive halfback this season. This Saturday at Navy, he’s slated to

this week.

A wave of injuries last week
made it necessary for Ed Whit-
taker. Bill Pilconis and J. D. Lew-
is to go both ways against Syra-
cuse.. But Saturday's contest with
the Orangemen left the Panthers
in much graver physical condi-
tion. Pilconis and Lewis will con-
tinue double duty against Navy.
while Whittaker moves back to of-
fense.

Lewis is slated to start at the
defensive safety slot in place of
the injured Jeff Barr. but the
speedster from North Carolina
will also see action offensively at
wingback. Meanwhile. ~ Pilconis
will be used more on defense this
week due to an injury to defen-
sive end Bob Ellis. But the 6'6"
sophomore will also be used as a
receiver.

“I may play at split end Satur-
day,” explained Pilconis, “but the
way we practiced today George
Medich moved from tight end to
wingback a n d R o d Fedorchak
moved up to tight end. Skip Ors-
zulak stayed at split end. I was on
defense all day and _J. D. moved
to safety. I think we’ll stay that
_way, but with all the injuries, it’s
hard to say.” '

Whittaker. on the other hand.
will stick strictly to offense this
week. “I won’tbe going both ways
anymore." commented the senior
tackle. “I moved back to first
team offense this week. I just
went both ways last week because
of injuries and because the coach-
es.weren't sure how they’d be us-
ing me after I recovered from my
knee injury.

 
  
  
   
  
     
  
  
  
    

 

. BILL PILCONIS

“Thre still are a lot of injuries
on the team. but this week we’ll
be using only a four-man line in-
stead of five on defense. We’ll
go with the regular defensive tac-
kles. Stevens and Harkiewicz."

Going both ways didn’t cause
much difficulty for any of the
boys, although Pilconis, indicated
he got a little confused when he
moved from split end, to tight end,
to flanker and back to defense.

“I actually played four differ-
ent positions last week." explain-
ed Pilconis. “But I like playing
both ways. It gave me the oppor-
tunity to play _a lot more. I like
playing defense. but I never
thought I'd be playing there in
.college. I need about 15 pounds to
play defense.

“I like it too.” agreed Lewis.
“but it was kind of tiring. But I

the kick-off team. the kick-off re-

team. But I like it.

 

“I did have a little trouble ad-

justing to going two ways because
of the number of plays you have
to learn,” continued J. D., “and
it was kind of hard to remember
them all quickly.

“I didn’t have much trouble
with offense and defense both be-
cause I really didn't play them
continuously. I was pretty well
rested between each series of
downs.” commented Whittaker.
who missed the early part of the
season with a knee injury. “My
leg is in good shape now and I’m
ready to go. But I’ll be staying on
offense."

Whittaker. one of the Panther
tri-captains. is one of the few who
have returned from the ranks of
Hart‘s walking wounded. Mean-
while. players like Bill Pilconis
and J. D. Lewis must continue to
go two ways until the list of in-
juries begins to shrink instead of
grow.

Frosh Gridders Fight Time Before
Initial Clash Against W. Virginia

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The count-down has started.
In ten days the freshmen foot-
ballers travel to Morgantown
and perform in a college game sit-
uation for the firsttime.

Frosh football coach Carl Ko-
kor and his 43 man squad are anx-
ious. but they are faced with the
same old problem—time.

“We haven't worked together
enough." admitted Kokor readily.
“but it’s the same for most fresh-
man teams. West Virginia has
worked together very little."

The Cubs have learned all the
offensive plays that they’ll be us-'
ing, as well as all the defensive
strategies, but they get very little
time to work in game-like situa-
tions.

Kokor usually gets to work with
one offensive unit and a few ‘de-
fenders at a time. while the rest
of the Cubs are scattered all over

Forbes Field with the varsity.

“There‘s just not enough kids to
work with for a scrimmage." said
Kokor while pointing to one of-
fensive unit running plays against
a few defenders at one corner of
Forbes Field.

But the Cubs get plenty of con-
tact.

“They get battered and batter-
ed by the varsity." said Kokor. “I
don't know how different it is
anywhere else. You only know
the temperature of the water you
swim in."

West Virginia freshman foot-
ball coach Dale Evans has stated
that his boys have had very little
contact thus far. but the Little
Mountaineers go up against the
Virginia Tech frosh Saturday.
That could give them an ‘advan-
tage when the Cubs invade Oct.
25.

“I’m doing my best to keep
them together,” explained Kokor.
“We try to make them feel that
they are one unit and that when

 

 

they get split up to help the’ var-
sity it’s only temporary. We don’t
want them to feel that they are
always split up, and one unit only
oncein awhile.’’ .. ’

Meanwhile. Kokor hopes to have
his squad together as much as
possible for the next ten days.
Practices will basically consist of
running the offensive plays over
and over again. and defending
against plays associated with a
West Virginia offense.

    

THE RECRUITED gridders will have more coaches to work with

them than in the past. (Left to right) Frosh Coach Carl_Kokor and as-

sistant coaches John Rosenberg, Fred Phillis, and Andy Dzurinko
(missing) are available.

Recovering From Injury

  Rodgers Eager to Win IC4A’s

by BILL NAAB

Sophomore Greg Rodgers be-
lieves that he and the other
members of the squad can
reach the goals which he set ear-
lierin the season in the sport he
really enjoys—cross-country.

"Once you're out on the course.
it feels great. We've got a good
coach to work with. and the guys
are great to ‘clown around with."
Rodgers continued. “We’ve gota
good spirit. We,a11 get along well.
Were trying to keep up the tra-
dition we set last year."

In order to maintain the tradi-
tion that the freshmen set last
season. Rodgers feels that the
squad must and can win the
IC4A‘s. In’additi0n. he believes
that the squad has a shot at the
.\'CAA's. ' '

“I’d like to win at the NCAA’s,"
said Rodgers. Also, to contribute
his part to a potential champion-
ship squad., Greg is attempting to
lower his best time of last season,
22:10, to at least under 21:30.

Recently. however. Greg has
been hobbled; His foot is Still
slwollenxeven though he has been
receiving treatments for more
than a week. Rodgers remarked.
“I‘m not limping anymore. and
I‘m going to start running again
on Tuesday. Most probably. a
stone bruised the bottom of my
arch. since" my shoes aren‘t too
strong on the bottom."

Rodgers reported that the fast
race at .\’otre Dame surprised him
but chalks it off as good experi-
ence. He stated that the team
couldn’t keep up the pace.

“I went out too fast, and died
out after_ two or three miles. It
was the fastest five mile race I’ve
been in,” said Rodgers. Greg stat-
ed that it was a good speed work-
out, and considered the times as
good. He believes that the squad

could have done better, but it has- ’

n’t really been working on fast
speeds.

"We’ve been running more in-
tervals in slower times. instead of
less intervals in faster times.” of-
fered Greg. "We’ll hold the
speed work off until the Penn
State meet. Iguess we‘ll do less
distance running and probably
concentrate more on speed before
the IC4A's." 

He added ‘that ‘the harriers
would set a better pace. if they

raced the flat five miles again.
“Notre Dame was only our first
fast meet. and (Jerry) Richey was
fantastic for the ‘first two miles."
Greg explained.

In addition, the indicated the
squad ran the _fastest they’ve ever
run. “We feel we should’ve been
in the top three,” Rodgers stated.
“Everyone could have done a lot
better, except for probably Rich-
ey. .

"Jerry's a nice guy to'rely on.
He gives the four other guys an
extra boost. It‘s niceto run be-
hind him." Greg commented. He
also indicated that Richey is a
hard worker and a goo_d.leader.i
“We"ve got to be good.‘ also."
added Rodgers.

Moreover. R o d g e r sindicated
that the harriers might win the
IC4A‘s this year. and if not
they'll be extremely strong next
season. He proclaimed. “One of
these next two years. I know that
we'll be on top."

N orm- Roux Obtains Experience,
Becomes Most Consistent Booter

by ED CONLEY

Norm Roux. the varsity soccer team’sl
starting center fullback. has a handfull of

younger brothers; they all play soccer in Norm’s

hometown of Tenafly. New Jersey, where the
sport is quite popular.
Norm didn‘t get the early start that his brothers

are enjoying. and he shows some regret. He stated.
“I wish I had. but I didn‘t."

Then. he added. “Fortunately. however. I start-

ed in my sophomore year in high school. and I play- V

ed three years."

The booter missed the entire ' season in his
senior year of high school due to injury, but did come
here with valuable experience. He also has gained
important playing time since he’s been here.

This is why he is playing where he is. now. Coach -
Leo Bemis remarked. “I switched Norm from out-
side fullback to the ‘inside because of his experience.
I figure him to be the best all-around back we have.

“His skills are above average, he kicks them where

he has to, and he has good game sense.” the coach
continued

Roux also has the size (six-feet) and the speed
to go along with these traits, making him every bit
of what the mentor claims.

Bemis likes the play of Norm Roux; that’s pretty
obvious. But. there is something the coach would
still liketo see Norm do. “I’d like him to play like
he did Saturday—carrying the ball through.” the
coach commented.

Roux was quite effective with his control of the
ball during the game against Temple. One of his
efforts resulted in a broken ankle for Owl Kicke
James Dunn. '-

Despite all this success Roux seems _to behaving,

his coach would like to take him out of the full-
back spot. “I’d like to move him to middle halfback.
He could work-out there he could develop a scor-
ing shot,” Bemis related.

Roux is all for that idea. too. He explained.
“Sure. I prefer centerhalf. You're in the game
more: you're in on more plays.

"It’s a killer. though. There's a lot more run-'

ning. You've’ got to be crazy to play it. But. I guess
I‘m crazy." the kicker continued.

He plays the fullback position.because he has
to, however. Bemis feels that he must use four full-
backs with his present squad.

Roux doesn't think that he is doing as well as he
could this season. despite the views of his coach. The
back said." I‘m doing fairly well in comparison
to the team as a whole. But. I’m not playing up to my
potential."

Why does Roux think the team is doing as poor

as it is? “For some reason were afraid of them (the

opposition l.” he answered.

“It’s hard to pick out what it is or why. We’re
just afraid of making mistakes,” he added.

The kicker is quick to reply as to what can
take away this fear. “A few wins!" he remarked.

He also thinks that he knows ‘what can bring
those wins. He mentioned, “All we have to do is get
together and play our game. No team has been bet-
ter than us; We’re at least ‘as good as all of them.

“We get behind early, and have a tendancy, not
to give up completely, but we get the attitude that
we can’t win,” Roux concluded.

But. Norm doesn’t believe that his team can't
win. He knows what they’ll have to do. He reason-
ed “The only way to win is to get on top of the
team — that’s the easy way! ”

Roland Laurenzo’s fondness for his father’s frozen
and Italian foods has finally cost him. The size 28 football pant
that Laurenzo wore all last season are a little too snug this fal 

Equipment manager Skip Kaleta confirms that Laurenzo. w

size 30 pants. Among the Midshipmen. halfback Rom Marchetti is th"
only other player who could wear the same size “ 'i

In keeping with a slightly
larger statistic around the middle.
Laurenzo has assumed a larger
role in Navy’s offense._He is the
Middies’ number one running
back. including an outstanding
performance against Boston Col-
lege two weeks ago—92 yards on
13 trips from scrimmage and 81
more on four kickoff returns.

Laurenzo isn’t ready to stamp
1968 a success just on the basis
of his early games. “Remember
last year,” he cautions. After a
promising start, the 1967 season
did turn into a disappointment
for the fleet halfback.

To his two-game rushing total
of 88 yards, he added just 18
yards in the final eight outings
last fall. He caught only two
passes (for 15 yards) after Navy’s
game with Rice a year ago. He
missed tow of the final eight
games completely and averaged
just four minutes apiece in four
others.

The turning point in Laurenzo's
1967 season seemed to come at
Michigan. Hit hard on a kickoff.
he was injured and never could
regain a role in the Navy starting
hneup.
