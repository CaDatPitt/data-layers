New S.U. Ass. Director
Outlines Role, Duties
And New 1.1). System

by ANN DORN

A recent graduate of the
University, Thomas Tack-
age, has assumed the posi-
tion of assistant director of
the Student Union. Working
under Director John Loch,
Tackage’s duties include “di-
rector of the ID services
and assistant of Union serv-
ices, such as reservations and
Union activities.”

Tackage graduated in 1967
from the University as an eco-
nomics major, He assumed his
position July 12. He plans to at-
tend night school at the Univer-
sity in January to study for -a
-masters in education adminis-
tration. _

One of the outstanding inno-
vations that Tackage described
is the change in the ID card sys-
tem. “There will be two cards
now. One will be plastic emboss-
ed which the student wiH keep
with -him through all his years»
at the University, including grad-
uate study. The other one will

 be of paper and will -have only

term validation. This card will
be marked with numbers assign-
ed -to each University event.
Every time it's used, a number
will be punched out. In t-his way,
the permanent ID won't ‘have to

I be marked.”

Tackagt elaborated, “The tem-
porary ID will be used at ath-
letic events, Homecoming, Win-
ter. Weekend, Student Govern-
ment affairs, and various social
and other events where the ID
would normally have to be
marked. The permanent card
can be used for identiﬁcation, li-
brary check-out, and other simi-
lar needs.” '

Tackage noted that neither t-he
permanent nor the temporary
ID will contain the student’s pic-
ture. “This will mean,” he said,
“that if the student loses his
card, a new one will be easier
to obtain.” Tackage doubts that
the lack ‘of picture identiﬁcation
will cause -any additional t-rou-
ble. “The students who take ad-
vantage of the ID card will do
so anyway,

“The faculty and staff will
also receive ID cards, each a
different color.” Tackage empha-
sized that the permanent ID will
be sent with the invoice kit to
each student before the school
year «begins. The temporary card
will either be sent along with
the permanent one or picked up
at Student Accounts upon pay-
ment of the invoice.

Tackage stated that the hard-
est part of his new position is
“getting used to the transition
between student and staff mem-
ber.”

disgust before the end of the
first act if it had not been for
Jackie Kahane (not seeing the
Baja Marimlba Band was also
very diusaippointing).

From the beginning Kah-ane
had the audience rolling. ‘His
biting wit and humorous opera-
tions covered every bit of come-
dian and American li-fe. From
dogs as pets to duels in the shop-

" ping center, Kahane left no rug

OK, but he appeals to a particu-

page 2 -— THE prrr News —— Tuesday, July 25. 1967

The Spring Trimester may be the answer for students pursuing
careers in medicine who want to consolidate their und€1'g1'ad113t€ educa'
tion, but unfortunately it has created serious problems in other 1'E‘~Sl)€CtS-

The advantage of obtaining one’s diploma after attending school
for only two years and eight months is astrong selling point for our
University, yet in practice the biggest asset of our trimester system has
turned out to be the four-and-a-half month summer vacation period.

The University is fortunate if it has one-ﬁfth the amount of stu-
dents attending school during the Spring Term that attend the other
two trimesters. This state of affairs has seriously hampered the effective-
ness of student activities. ‘

One case in point was the recent Student Government (SG) Sen-
ate meeting to discuss the allocations for student activities for the com-
ing year. Only 11 senators out of the 25 elected to office attended that
meeting, and at the end only six remained. The m-ost important decision
made by our SG Senate, passing ﬁnal approval on the operating budgets
of our student organizations, was placed in the hands of a minority.

The SG president is not required to attend school for all three
terms, and this too creates problems in carrying out the duties of this
office. Although the SG Constitution, which was approved by our student
body last year, stipulated that the president must attend school two of the
three terms, the possibility of amending this requirement should be

Obligations To Fulfill

One should also not overlook the question of whether the senators
should be penalized for missing a certain number of meetings. The flag-
rant disregard for their duties by some members of our Senate should
not go unnoticed. ,Unfortunatel_\', they detract from those senators who
are earnest and take their work seriously. The senators might be re-
quired to attend all three terms, too. '

The only students now required to attend all three trimesters are -

the editor and the business manager of The Pitt News. This stipulation
is obviously in effect because our newspaper is published during the en-
tire school year. Yet, we must seriously question if those students in the
key leadership positions who do not attend school for the Spring Term
can effectively fulfill their responsibilities.

We are required to publish a paper during the summer months,
yet the fact that other students in leadership positions are not in atten-
dance serves to impede the progress that those of us who are in school
can ‘make. r

If there are responsibilities for student leaders to fulﬁll that re-
quire them to be at the University during the summer months,'we rec-
ommend that these obligations be fulﬁlled during the other two terms
or that these students be required to attend school all year. Otherwise,
we'll have Senate meetings with six people in attendance making crucial

decisions affecting our entire student body. But unless other provisions" A

 

 

given serious consideration.

The Handicap Is Here To Stay

Wills and Wheels

I HAVE been handicap-
ped since birth,-but I have
only had to deal with the

A  obstacles which face a wheel-

chair student at the Univer-
sity for a year. Through
careful observation, I have
come to the conclusion that

more steps can be taken to

improve the situations which
face a disabled student.
My parents had taught me
that nothing is impossible
but they were wrong. One
thing is impossible . . . I can-
not sprout wings to reach
the second ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral. Throughout the year
there“ have been two classes

- which I have wanted to take.

One’ I succeeded in persu_ad—
ing Student Records to relo-
cate on the third ﬂoor, but
the other was deﬁnitely clos-
ed to me. Many interesting
lectures have been given on
the second ﬂoor which I
wanted to attend, but they
Weren";.. going  inove the
lecture up or down for any

, one Person and I didn’t ex-
~ pect that. I missed some ter-
, riﬁc opportunities to hear

people speak in my ﬁeld. I

-. know that many of my‘fel-

low students in wheel chairs
face this problem. Surely a

 simple solution would be to
’ find -a new lecture area where

all students could attend.
Although some curbs have

been cut down (many more
remain to be cut), nothing
has been done to protect the
crossings. Often I have
found a car parked right in
my path and, once again,
since I don’t have wings, I
can neither fly over the car,
nor can I slide underneath
the vehicle. Across the Unit-
ed States are designated
signs which read: “Deer
Crossings” or “Cattle Cross-
ing.” Surely some sign can
be placed reading “Wheel—
Chair Crossing.”

STEPS, STEPS, and more
steps . . . and- my wings are
clipped. There are many

ramps on the campus area

but we could use a few more.
One especially that would be
useful is in the new library.

It may be positive thinking

but I am sure that plans
have been made to include
one ramp with ' railings so
that every student (abled
and disabled can avail him-
self of this necessary facil-
ity.

For each student who is

disabled, the degree of the «=

obstacles is relative to his
personal handicaps. For ex-
ample, many students with
strong arms ﬁnd no difficulty
pushing themselves» up and
down the ramps, but a _per-
son who cannot use his arms
deﬁnitely has a problem.

are made, what else can we expect‘?

by Sunday Uher

This is where understand-
ing and the willingness to ‘co-
operate can be shared by
normal and disabled students
alike. Understanding is vital
on both sides. As there are
many different personalities
so there are many different
degrees ‘ of disabilities. We
must be aware of this fact
and try to help theones who
do need a push up or down
the ramps. The handicapped
student who is able to push
himself must realize that
just because he is capable of

doing these things ‘does not‘

mean that all of his fellow
wheel chair students are able
to accomplish the same task.

When offered aid he can
graciously accept or decline,
paving the -way for the dis-
abled student who does need
and appreciates the assis-
tance. The normal student

_must -be aware that even

though his offer of aid is de-
clined by one, this does not
mean it,wouldn’t be needed
and accepted by another.

AWARENESS IS the key
to understanding. I sincerely
hope that this article has en-
lightened both students and
faculty to some of the prob-
lems of the disabled student.
It was not «meant to criticize
or degrade a particular atti-
tude. It was merely meant to

‘ bring to the surface the

problems and the attitudes
of all concerned with mak-
ing Pitt an institution where
both handicapped and normal
students may share equal op-
portunities for friendships
and higher education.

I am grateful for‘the op-
portunity to attend Pitt.
Within its boundaries, I have
found a wealth of warmth,
understanding and friend-
ship. It is my desire to ex-
tend this warmth and friend-
ship to all future disabled
and normal. students and
seek a way to eliminate many
of the obstacles which real-
ly don’t have to exist.

 

The Racial Riots

Death of Equality?

LAST WEEK the ﬂames
engulfed the city of Newark,
N. J. Today the city of De-
troit, Mich., is the victim of
the passions._ Tomorrow,
maybe Pittsburgh will _be en-
gulfed in the ﬂames of riot.
Unfortunately, no one can
really predict where the riot
will break out. '

It makes no (lifference
where the next racial riot
breaks out, however, because
the riot (as a means to end)
is now almost an institution.
The unparalleled destruction
of the riots has been going
on for at least three years.
Yet, this summer's rioting is
by far the worst to date.

Yesterday, in Detroit,"

“Governor Romney appealed
for Federal troops to back
up 10,000 National Guards-
man and police already in
the area. He did so after a
tour of the area with Mayor
Jerome P. Cavanaugh, who
estimated damage to the city
at 100 million dollars.”

THE CALL for the use of
Federal troops had not been
used in any of the previous
racial riots that have span-

ned over the past three‘

years. The last racial inci-
dent serious enough to initi-
ate the call for Federal troops
was in 1943.

Blocks of homes (in De-
troit) were destroyed by ﬁre
and snipers traded" shots
with policemen. Mayor Cav-
anaugh said, “The disturbing
thing was the number of peo-
ple on the street. It was like
a carnival spirit—a great
lake.” '

As the rioting,‘ looting,
and sniping increased, Gov.
Romney “declared a state
of emergency, ordered all
schools and government of-
ﬁces closed, forbade liquor

sales, ‘and slapped on a cur--

few which police - in many
areas could not even attempt
to enforce.”

ASIDE FROM ‘the racial
conﬁict in Detroit, Negro
rioting was reported yester-
day in New Britain, Conn.;
Kalamazoo, Mich.; Birming-
ham, Ala.; and Newark, N.
J. The rioting in these‘ areas,
however, was on a smaller
scale.

Its really hard to believe
that yesterday’s racial riot-
ing occurred in ﬁve urban

cause. A

by Paul Stoller

areas. These dismal ventures,
morever, have caused over
100 million dollars worth of
damages. Yet, the racial riots
have had other manifesta-
tions.

It is not very difficult for
any person, irrespective of
his race, color or creed, to

-see htere is now open rebel-

lion in our cities. Snipers
shoot at National Guards-
man. Helicopters try to ﬂush
out the snipers. Roof dwel-
lers hurl‘ their Molotov Cock-
tails at traffic. This is re;
bellion!

YET, REBELLION is not
a means to an end in this

__nation where the tradition
and fact of pluralism has

caused political. leaders to
pay heed to all minority
groups. .
Unfortunately, many so
called militant civil rights
groups fail to recognize this
fact. Supporters of the “black
power” movement have not

even condemned the recent,

riots. Instead, they have said
that nothing can halt the
tide of the rioting.

Leaders at the recent na-
tional conference on “Black
Power” did not seem to be
too disturbed about the death
and devastation of the riot-
ing. One Negro stated that
“rioting -was about the only
way that we can get what we
want and need.”

ONLY A fool would turn
his head and say that the
Negro of America doesn't
have valid wants and needs.
Yet, only a fool could believe
that racial rio.ting is the best
channel to - achieve Negro
goals.

No matter what any Ne-A

gro leader says, rioting has
had an adverse effect on the
Civil Rights movement.-Peo-a
pie who once were active con-'
tributors and participants in
the Civil Rights Movement
are not merely apathetic ob-
servers. The vital link be-

tween Negro leaders and po- —

litical leaders has been signi-
ficantly weakened. As a re-
sult of these riots, Ia just
Civil Rights movement is
crumbling.

All Negro leaders should
tune their ears to" reason.
They should realize that riot-
ing is an evil——a cancer that
is devouring a just, Negro
