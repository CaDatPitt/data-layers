WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1991

and Pitt in matrimony

By Gary Knapick
Staff Writer

You’ve heard of a shotgun
wedding, but how about a
machine-gun wedding?

The Youth and Student
Coalition Against Militarism, in
conjunction with Pitt’s Students
for Peace, officially consummated
what they call the close
relationship between the
Department of Defense and the
University of Pittsburgh in the
“Marriage from Hell” yesterday
afternoon.

The mock wedding, performed
on the steps of the William Pitt
Union, was intended to educate
passers—by on “the continued
shifting ofcampus attention from
education to militarization,”

according to PSfP member Cassi
Geier.

“People need to know about .
the military’s involvement in the '

university. There are students

doing research who don’t realize ,

the implications of what they're
working on.

» “They’re spending their college
years creating [weapons] of mass
death and destruction,” Geier said.

“lCarnegie Mellon] receives
more money from military
contracts than from tuitions, even
as tuition rises to almost $20,000
per student,” Erin Bush, also a
member of PSIP, said.

“lMilitary contracts] are ruining
academic freedom and making
universities into tools of the
Pentagon,” said Bush, who

Vandal strikes garage

By David T. Welch

Asst. News Editor

Seven students’ vehicles parked
in the Towers garage had their
windows smashed with a fire
hose last Saturday afternoon.

The vandal broke into the
entrance of the garage between
4:40 and 5:08 p.m. After breaking
the windows, the vandal searched
the contents of the glove boxes
leaving the contents strewn about,
according to a campus-police
crime report.

Campus police have no
suspects according to Bob
Reteshka, a university
spokesman. “If [campus police]
had any names, they would
probably arrest him. All they have
is a description,” Reteshka said.

One of the car owners
reported being approached by
an unidentified individual
described as a black male in his

20s. He is approximately 5 feet 10
inches, weighs 170 pounds and
was wearing a black hat with a
letter “C” or “B” on it and
baggy jeans at the time of the
incidents.

Two other incidents in the
Towers garage were reported this
past weekend. One victim
reported her car window was
broken and $2,400 worth of items
were stolen last Friday.

A 1987 red Honda was stolen
Friday between 9:15 a.m. and
2:18 p.m., according to the crime
notice.

Director of Public Safety
William Brennan referred all
comments to University Relations.

Reteshka refused to release the
names of the owners of the
vandalized vehicles. ‘‘If we
released the names [of the victims],
the perpetrator of the crimes might
decide to take action into his
own hands,” Reteshka said.

PCI receives $3.7 million

By Michael Lowe
Staff Wﬁter

The Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
has received a core grant from
the National Cancer Institute for
more than $3.7 million over four
years, reinforcing its standing as
one of the leading cancer—research
centers in the United States.

In 1988, PCI received its first
core grant from the NCI totalling
more than $3 million over three
years. In this three—year period
PCI was designated one of 28
Comprehensive Cancer Centers

in the United States by the NCI.

The new core grant is
essentially a continuation of the
first core grant, according to Dr.
Ronald B. Herberman, director
of PCI.

“PCI is functioning well and is
being recognized ‘ as a major
cancer center,” Herberman said.

According to Herberman, some
of the work that PCI has been
involved in is a national
cooperative-group trial that uses
interferon for treatment in patients
with melanoma, a cancerous
tumor. The interferon is used to

grant

combat the possibility of a
recurring tumor.

The grant does not fund any
one specific area but supports
the laboratory, clinical,
educational and preventive
programs at PCI.

PCI was established in 1984

through the joint efforts of Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon, Presbyterian
University Hospital, Montefiore
University Hospital, Eye and Ear
Institute, Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic, Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh and Magee
Women’s Hospital.

.9017/t7”ld€7"S addresses Mag/orMasl0jj"’s budget cuts

By Cristine McCauley
For The Pitt News

Student Government President Brent
Saunders said the‘Pitt campus could be
at risk if Mayor Sophie Masloff-‘s proposed
budget cuts become reality.

Saunders met Sunday with Captain
Paul Sherman of Engine Company
Number 10 of the Pittsburgh Fire
Department to discuss the proposed
budget cuts made by Masloff. » I '

The proposal could cut 12 fire stations
in Pittsburgh. There is currently a five to
eight—minute response time to emergency
calls. It would increase to 10 to 12
minutes if the cuts go into effect.

“The response time is already high. A
usual response time is three to four
minutes,” Saunders said: _

Fires spread at 10 times per minute,

according to Saunders. “We could lose a
whole block,” Saunders said.

“Central Oakland is at a 30-percent risk
that the fire department could not respond
in time. North Oakland is at a 98-percent
risk. Students could die,_” he said.

When a call comes in, three companies
are dispatched to a one-alarm fire. The
department could be gone for an hour. If
the department is out, that raises the re~
sponse time also, according to Saunders.

Under the first—alert program, the lire
department goes out with the paramedics,
and they cannot leave the call. This
increases response times to fires also,
according to Saunders.

In the report read by Saunders, students ,

on campus were not counted because

they are not considered permanent 7
residents. This, according to Saunders,_

lowered Oakland’s priority.

“The firemen are not worried about
their jobs. They can be transferred. They

‘are worried about the public’s safety.

The proposal is ridiculous. It puts so
many people in danger. If you look at
how the system works, it puts th
community at risk. '

“I was surprised to see how the city is
laid out. Not only Oakland would be put
in danger but other communities as well.
Students and residents need to voice
their opinion in opposition to the cuts,”
Saunders said.

In other business: ’
j-Carrie Mertz was appointed the SGB
Student Relations Committee chairperson.
-Mark Rosen was appointed the SGB

A Public Safety Committee chairpgrson.

-Mlleetthe Candidates will be held

lWedn_'esday in the'William Pitt Union

Ballroom at 6 p.m.

°There will be a meeting with Pitt
Ambassadors, the School of Education
and a representative from the intramural
program to discuss the money for the
weight room in Trees Hall. SGB wants to
try to push up the date and get the
money raised as soon as possible.

“We are afraid the Pitt Ambassadors
will nothave the money until spring.
This is fine, and we are grateful for the
donation, but we want to try to discuss a
way to get the money earlier,” SGB
member Gil Golden said.
oThere will be a meeting Saturday
afternoon with Mayor Masloff, the Pitt
police, city police and the SGB Public
Safety Committee. They will be discussing
Crime Stop and the Stay Safe guide.
-The SGB Academic Affairs Committee
is looking into the book store raising
prices to over 50 percent of the cost. .

‘ Staﬂ" ’Writer

_Pitt Professor Robert G. Hazo
has been nominated for 1991

_ Man of the Year in Pittsburgh for

his role in a unique course called
The American Experience.
Hazo was nominated in the

category of Education by Vectors/

Pittsburgh, a community
organization, for the second time
in 10 years. He was nominated
for thesame award 10 years ago
but did not win.

“I don't expect to win because
I don’t have a large constituency,
but it would be an honor," Hazo
said.

Nearly 21 years ago Hazo
created The American
Experience, a course which
encourages intelligent political
discussion among administrators
and examines the assumptions
behind which those opinions are
‘based. Hazo, along with part-
time assistant Lynnette Coster,
handle all the arrangements and
scheduling.

“I viewed and still view public

- dialogue about political problems

as bad. I wanted to try to get
adults into a course that would
enable them to talk about current
issues. Ordinary political talk isn’t
deep enough. I wanted to make
people understand the
assumptions behind the positions
they take," Hazo said. ‘

Members meet approximately
twice a month and discuss various
political readings.

Hazo said he keeps his personal
opinions out of discussions. “I
take part in the discussion but I
don't let anyone know what my
opinion is during the discussion.
I will take any position. I try and
maintain a level of formality so
that the personality can be
submerged and the idea can be
featured,” Hazo said.

“The principle that governs all
[The American Experience’s]
activities is that quality should

take precedence over all other '

considerations. It cannot be said
that the program has measured
up to this, but it can be said that

  

Robert I-Iazo's American Experience course examines political

opinions.
the principles were never
deliberately compromised.

~» “People get a deeper
understanding of their opinion
because it is subject to the scrutiny
of others. All seminars are geared
toward raising discussion and
stimulategpeoplie to come to their
own opinion. It’S easy to have an
opinion, but its hard to have a
thoughtful one,” Hazo said.

Dan Buczynski/I‘ he Pitt News

In addition to the meetings,
two or three speakers are
scheduled for each year. This
year’s speakers include Pitt
President]. Dennis O'Connor and
William H. Sessions, Director of
the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

Previous speakers included

and Ted Turner. “People I knew
bet thatl coulgzlnft get Ted Turner,”
Hazo said smiling, “and I got him
to speak for free.”

Hazo’s favorite speaker was
Elliot L. Richardson, who has
held a number of public offices
and worked under Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger during the
Nixon administration.

“He had a message, and he
spoke in perfect English, and the
questions were about the lecture
and not about something else,”
Hazo said.

The criteria for being accepted

‘into the course, according to

Hazo, “are elastic.” Although he
says he aims for “those in
administrative positions or those

I who are being groomed for

administrative positions,” many
other kinds of people have taken
the course. “In the past,
undergraduates have attended.
Retirees have attended. I think
it's fair to say that no one has ever
been turned down,” Hazo said.

The costs of the program are
absorbed by the institution
sponsoring an individual, and
cost varies. Individuals coming
from a corporation are asked to
pay $1,150, while individuals from
non-profit organizations pay $495.

The cost of an individual from
an educational institution is
equivalent to the cost of a three-
credit course at Pitt.

People who have taken part in.

"the program have given Hazo
and his course high marks.
Raymond Wingard said, “The
educational content alone is more
than worth the time and money,

but the true value of this kind of _

intellectual sti mulation can hardly
be overstated.”

Another former participant, Guy
Tumolo, said, “If the expression
that education is wasted on the
young is true, then the American
Experience is corrective action.”

Hazo is disturbed by a lack of
communication that is prevalent
in society. “It is a national disgrace
that 50 percent to 75 percent of
all voters get everything they
know by watching television,”
he said. I

However he said he believes
things can change. “I think things
can be different, andl hope that
the American Experience can
contribute in some small way,”
Hazo said. ’

“Political talk has been reduced

to the business of political’

consultant; people use it to gain
approval rather than
understanding. The point that I’m
making is ,that salesmanship has
taken over statesmanship,” Hazo
said.

Hazo also referred to the
media’s role. “Most of the stuff
you get through the media is
short and simple, but our
problems are not short and
simple,” Hazo said.

Though Hazo is not currently
teaching undergraduates classes,
the possibility exists that The
American Experience will extend
to the student population.
“There’s talk of me teaching it in
The College of General Studies,
so it could be open- to adults,” he
said.

RoyRogers to participate in ‘Mug Yourself’

‘ ‘By Leon Fuksman
suqr Writer

Roy Rogers will participate with
members of Concerned Leaders
for Environmental Action Now in
the “Mug Yourself” conservation
effort to reduce Styrofoam use

A despite a last week decision not

to accept the program.
. John Miller, district manager of
Roy Rogers, said he never rejected

"the proposal and blamed the

confusion on a misunderstanding

. between CLEAN and one of the

managers at the Pitt Roy Rogers.
Both the Roy Rogers in the
Cathedral of Learning and the

Forbes Avenue location will be
participating in the program.

“We knew all along that this
was going to be a good program
and I am excited to get it started,”
Miller said.

Mug Yourself is a campaign to
rid Styrofoam cups in local
eateries. Roy Rogers will offer a
10-percent discount on coffee
and soft drinks to anyone who
presents the reusable 12-ounce
mug that CLEAN will sell next
month on the ground floor of the
William Pitt Union.

Dean Focareta, president of

CLEAN, said students and staff .

the idea.

“People understand that using
Styrofoam is a waste to the
environment," Focareta said. “If
someone only buys one mug
then there won’t be anything
wasted.”

John Figlar, ’ general manager
of the Forbes Avenue Roy Rogers,
praised the CLEAN idea.

“I think its a good idea that will
not only help the environment
but also give the customers a
break in the wallet,” he said. “The
customers should act positively
to this effort because its about
time we start pitching in to help
the environment.”

Following a brief

The ceremony came to a

“You may now manipulate

The Pittsburgh Students

Harris the fairest

The tragic death of Sen. John Heinz last February
sparked the beginning of a heated campaign, when
Heinz’s wife, Theresa, declined to fill his position in the
U.S. Senate.

Candidates Harris Wofford and Richard Thornburgh '

will find out next week which one of them will fill the
empty seat for the remaining three years of Heinz’s term.

A Pennsylvania poll conducted by The Pittsburgh Post
Gazette and WTAE-TV earlier this week showed that
those polled from across the state have lost faith in the
former governor. Although" the majority of participants
admitted to being more familiar with Thornburgh, they
also expressed concern for his senatorial abilities.

In fact, In Pittsburgh reported that once T hornburgh
defeated Pete Flaherty in the 1978 governor’s race, he
turned his back on one of his most vital supporters — the
National Organization of Women. ‘

While Thornburgh was once an avid supporter of the '

ERA, he now claims that he was wrong. Not surprisingly,
this change, of heart occurred between 1980 and 1982,
when the Reagan—Bush era was just beginning. In order
to be in tune with these Republicans, T hornburgh also
rescinded his opposition to the death penalty. Once an
American Civil Liberties Union board and cardécarrying
member, his liberal, Rockerfeller Republican days ended
when Reaganomics took over. ' '

Such actions justify the loss of confidence by the
registered voters of Pennsylvania.

Wofford, on the other hand, has remained true to his
beliefs. _

Though his view on abortion has been described as
“incomplete,” he is respected by Democrats Who appreciate
the fact that he does not want to overturn Roe vs. Wade.

With the recent murder of 22 people in Texas, gun

. control has been a subject of hot debate in Congress. Both

candidates disagreed on a few technical points of gun-
control legislation, but, according to The Pittsburgh Post-_
Gazette, they agree that some pieces of the ban might
infringe on the rights of sportsmen and legitimate gun
owners.

Both men would also like to see a limit placed on the
terms of legislators.

The candidate’s goal in competing is to please the
residents of the state of Pennsylvania. According to the
Pennsylvania poll, most have not been impressed with
Thornburgh or his actions at public meetings.

Wofford, on the other hand, has been a model of
strength. Althoughhis verbal attacks on Thornburgh have
proven to be harsh, he has shown that he is a man of
power who'can handle the heat that is often dished out

. to those running for political office.

Wofford’s perception of choice is somewhat more
ﬂexible than that of Thornburgh’s. As for his voting
record, he recently said “no” to the confirmation of
Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice and also

‘ voted to override the Gag Rule, which was created earlier

this year and prevented doctors from discussing abortion
as an option to pregnancy with their patients.

Leadership is one quality which is prevalent throughout
Wofford’s character. Strong-willed democrats are scarce
in this day and age. Wofford is one man who has worked’
for and deserves a seat in the Senate.

Reduce social inadequacies at Pitt

The deﬁciencies of the social,
cultural and academic aspects of
Pitt have been documented and
are frequently discussed by black
students on this campus. The
curriculum at Pitt and other major
universities like it focus almost
entirely on the contributions and
perspectives of white males. For
a lesson in white-male supremacy,
one must only listen to professors
refer to George Washington as a
founding father. They
interestingly leave out the fact
that the man was a racist, who
once traded a black man for a keg
of molasses. If this is not enough,
sit back, relax and enjoy while
they tell you that Greece (Aristotle,
Socrates and company) is the
foundation of Western
Civilization.” They forget toztell
you that this civilization and its
scholars were taught by African
people. _ ’

In regard to social life, we all
know that there is little to do on
this campus. If any of the non-
black students on campus find
this hard to believe, ask a black
student for his/her perception of
the social life at Pitt. It is obvious

we have a problem, so what do .

we propose as a solution?

The University of Pittsburgh

students with every fall. A BCC
would bring in far more speakers
than BAS or PPC could handle or
afford to deal with our history

and political views. Seminars,‘

would be scheduled to show the-—

student body that there is much
more to the world than the West.
This would begin to deal with the
academic shortcomings of Pitt.
The BCC would be the place
for the bringing of dance and
theater troupes, which would not
only put on performances but
organize workshopsfor students
who don’t have the time to take
classes similar to these offered at
Pitt. These workshops would be
open to all students and would
be held free of charge to students,
since they would be a part of the
BCC budget. Various art exhibits
would also be presented for the
enrichment of the students.
These are just a few of the ways
we must begin to deal with Pitt's
cultural deficiencies. ‘All of the
aforementioned would deal with
the social shortcomings of Pitt.
Purdue University’s BCC-
sponsored “Black Coffee Houses”
are regularly held and provide a
showcase for local talent in poetry
and drama while giving students
another‘ option on weekend

nights. As if this isn’t enough, let
us briefly mention
maintaining and developing our
way of life is mandated by
international law.

Article 27 of the United Nations
Covenant on Cultural and Political
Rights states very clearly that
“minorities shall not be denied
the right, in community with the
other members of the group, to
enjoy their own culture.”

The education system we are‘ A‘
presently under denies us this

right. We are taught perspectives

of European history and then are L

graded on bur ability to spit them
back up again on a set date.
This is not education. This is
the molding of an entire people
in the image of the European
man, and this is not acceptable.
This will be changed when the

BCC is brought to the Pitt campus. I
Blacks and all other students_

alike are robbed when only one
image is presented to them in

academic, social andcultural life. ‘ T

We spend too much money
paying for a miseducation that is
bringing about our own
destruction.

We must put a stop to this.

Help bring a BCC to Pitt so those

who follow us will have a better

chance at an education.

Colicchio surprising conributorfor Pitt

' By Rob Pugliese

Sta_[f Writer .

rLooks can be deceiving. Not
many people looked at first-year
tailback Tim Colicchio as an
immediate contributor to Pitt’s
offense this season. In fact,
Colicchio appeared ‘slated for a
redshirt season until injuries to
Glen Deveaux and Curtis Martin
depleted the Panthers’ backﬁeld
corps. '
But with Jermaine Williams

‘hobbled by a knee injury in the

second half of the Syracuse game,
head coach Paul Hackett called
on Colicchio to revive the ground
game.

Colicchio said he had a funny
feeling’there would come a time
when he would see action.

“There was always that chance
that I might get in,” Colicchio
said. “There's not a lot of depth
right now, andl always had hope.
Coach Peete always told me to be
ready.”

Colicchio’s ﬁrst collegiate carry

was less than a pleasant

experience, with Syracuse
lineback.er Glenn Young
dropping him for a one-yard loss.
But the first-year Panther
responded with a 40-yard effort
on" only six carries, including a
big, 22-yard run on the Panthers’

_ touchdown drive in the fourth

quarter.

“My first couple runs against
Syracuse I had a slow start, and
there's a little doubt there, but
then I broke through,” Colicchio
said.

“I got my chance, and it has all
paid off now.” _

He saw his role increase further
against East Carolina with 15
carries for 48 yards and three
pass receptions for 37 yards.

“He really made a giant step
forward last weekend,” Hackett
said.

“He gave us some critical,
critical plays. It shows you the
type of player he’ll be here in his
Pitt career.”

“Stats don’t prove too much,”
Colicchio said.

“But I thought I played a good
role in the game.”

Colicchio came to Pitt from
Erie Cathedral Prep after a senior
season in which he rushed for
2,355 yards on 215 carries and 37
touchdowns and was named the
Bobby Dodd State High School
Pennsylvania Back Of The Year.
He set Erie city records in rushing
and scoring and was named first-
team All-State.

The ﬁnal decision for college
ball came down to Syracuse and
Pitt.

Colicchio chose Pitt because it
was closer to home and many

people from his hometown are
familiar with Pitt.

He immediately made his
presence felt with an outstanding
effort at fall camp injohnstown.
The two things that Colicchio
struggled with early, pass
blocking and running pass routes,
are coming along fine now.
Colicchio credits his running
backs’ coach, Skip Peete, with
helping him improve.

At 5 feet, 11 inches and 208
pounds, Colicchio has deceptive
speed and an odd running style
that can’t really be compared to
anyone else’s.

Hackett described the style as
a “shufﬂe” and said Colicchio
uses shifty moves with the upper
body that make tacklers miss.

“The people who didn’t recruit
him really missed the boat,”
Hackett said.

“I have deceiving speed. It looks
like I’m going real slow and
actually I’m ﬂying right by you,”
Colicchio said. _

With the promising start
Colicchio enjoyed, his role should
increase each week, and Colicchio
relishes the fact that he’s counted
on to produce for the offense.

“It gives’ you the urge to get
better and do more for the team,”
he said. “I ’m just gonna be myself
and do whatever I can for the
team.”

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
Tim Colicchio has added another dimension to the Pitt offense.

Questions still abound for str

Some of my thoughts on football:

-What I am hearing from most Pitt
students is that Paul Hackett should have
tried the ﬁeld goal against East Carolina
with seven seconds left instead of trying
one more play. I tend to agree with these
“Monday-morning quarterbacks," if you
will, only because I’ve seen the offense. At
that point in the game I had more
conﬁdence in a kicker than any pass play.

The trouble is, of course, that a 47-yard
ﬁeld goal does fall into the “risky” category.
All things considered, however, the
Panthers should not have been in that
situation in the ﬁrst place. Good teams
rarely ﬁnd themselves in that situation,

where they receive the beneﬁts of turnovers‘

like Pitt did on Saturday.

-I think I saw an offense that is even
more misguided than Pitt’s, however. It
was bad enough that I was subjected to the

Derek Willis

Michigan State—Ohio State game Saturday
afternoon, but the Spartans’ offense is just
really bad. I mean, they have one of

America’s premier offensive weapons in .

receiver Courtney Hawkins, and they don’t
use him. George Perles, wake up. If Perles
is wondering why his team's record is as

bad as it is, he should look at his offensive
scheme.

In the Ohio State game the Spartans
threw to Hawkins just once in three
quarters. It’s no coincidence they trailed
OSU going into the ﬁnal quarter. Having
received a late wake-up call, the Spartans
finally started to throw the ball Hawkins’

,way.

Of ‘course, the Ohio State players saw
this coming from the Ohio border. Hence,
Michigan State failed. ‘

Similarly, when Pitt needs to throw,
where do they go? To tight ends Eric
Seaman and Dave Moore, two’ fine
receivers. They are Pitt’s most consistent

uggling Pitt offense

pass—catchers. Unfortunately, opponents
can tell this from watching about 10 minutes
of film. ‘

The Panthers did show some variation
on this theme last weekend, though. On
the final drive, Chad Askew figured
prominently, and Chris Bouyer is also
becoming a bigger part of the scheme.

’ Still, the passing attack is severely one-
dimensional. Hackett has said that it’s

because. Pitt gets blitzed a lot and that

forces quarterback Alex Van Pelt to get rid
of the ball quickly.
Suppose Pitt keeps one of the two tight
ends in to block consistently. Would that

Spurs to jingle and shine in Midwest Division

By Brandy L. Simms
Staﬂ‘ Writer -

Last season three teams in the
Midwest Division had over 50
wins. San Antonio, Utah and
Houston all reached the half-
century plateau. The Spurs won
the race by a game; the Jazz were
a close second and the Rockets
weren't far behind. Only three
games separated those teams.

The premier big man in this
division is David Robinson (Sorry,
Hakeem), and if he’s healthy,
look for the San Antonio Spurs
to go far. They sent Dwanyne
Schintzius to Sacramento and
acquired veteran power forward
Antoine Carr to go along with a
frontcourt that already includes
Terry Cummings and Sean Elliott.
A solid backcourt that features
shooting guard Willie Anderson

and point guard Rod Strickland is
back and ready to make a run at
the title.

The key here is definitely
Robinson, who averaged 25.6
points and 15 rebounds last
season. Injuries plagued the San
Antonio starters a year ago; they
must avoid them this time around.
Bench help is also a must, or this
team could falter early. Prediction:
Look for the Spurs to win between
55 and 60 games, which will
obviously send them to the
playoffs for the third straight year.
David Robinson, barring injury,
will win the MVP award. (Sorry
Charles, Michael, Magic, etc.)

The 12,616—seat Salt Palace was
the smallest NBA arena last year.
This wasn’t good enough for a
franchise that could probably, in
a larger market, draw twice that
amount. So the Utah Jazz have

digs — the 20,400-seat Delta
Center.

If Utah has as much success in
its new home as it had in the old
one, it’ll be headed for another
trip to the playoffs.

V Up front, they’re led by Karl
“The Mailman” Malone, who is
once again primed and ready to
make a title run. Last season
Malone averaged 29 points and

‘ nearly 12 rebounds. This season _

he’ll likely pass Adrian Dantley
as the franchise's all—time scoring
leader. Seven—foot, four-inch, 290-
pound Mark Eaton is a shot-
blocker extraordinare and always
makes his presence felt whenever
he’s on the court. At 6-11, Thurl
Bailey is a solid, capable
performer who will also
contribute to this team.

The backcourt duo of Jeff

Malone and John Stockton is one
of the league’s best. Malone
possesses a deadly outside shot
so defenses will have to play him
honest and avoid giving him the
open shot. Stockton is as good as
point guards get. He doesn’t
dazzle you with fancy moves but
gets the j_ob done. The Jazz
welcomes the addition of rookie
point guard Eric Murdock. Blue
Edwards will contribute at the
small forward position.

As Malone and Stockton go, so
do the Jazz. Utah will need
consistent play from both players
in order for them to make it back
to the playoffs. For the last two
years theJazz has lost the division
title to the Spurs on the last day of
the season.

When Hakeem Olajuwon went
down with an injury in early
January, critics thought the

Houston Rockets were doomed.
But they managed to maintain
their composure and went 15-10
during his absence. When
Olajuwon returned to the lineup,
the Rockets went 14-1 during the
‘month of March and made the
playoffs.‘

Well, Olajuwon returns along
with a supporting cast that
includes forwards Otis Thrope
and Buck Johnson as well as
guards Kenny Smith, Vernon
Maxwell and Sleepy .Floyd. In
fact, the Rockets return everyone
from last season’s 52-30 squad.
With the addition of 6-8 power
forwardjohn Turner, the Rockets
will be seeking to claim the
division title that eluded them a
year ago.

The Rockets are making a name
for themselves as‘ a run—and-gun

Lacrosse team ﬁnishes strong at West Wrginia tournegx

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

The Panther lacrosse team
finished up its 1991 fall season
this past weekend with a solid
performance at the Mountaineer
Invitational Lacrosse Tournament,
hosted by the University of West

Virginia.
The 16-team tournament

showcased squads from the.

University of Michigan, Ohio
University, Roanoke, UNC-
Charlotte, the University of
Buffalo, Washington &Jefferson,
West Virginia-Wesleyan and
Carnegie Mellon and lacrosse

give Van Pelt more time to look
downfield?I do not know. Would
I like to see this tried more often?
You better believe it.

0 That being said, I also believe
that the passing offense can work.
I know this means very little to
most everyone, but I for one am
sold on Hackett’s basic scheme,
with one big exception. It seems
to me that on nearly every pass
play I see, Junior Green is wide
open. I mean either with one—on—
one coverage, or with a lone
safety playing zone.

It really mystifies me to see a
receiver open so many times and
not have the ball thrown his way

~more than once or twice a game.
Does anyone else see this, or am
I just hallucinating?

-The running game is not a

sore spot, despite what some

people might say. It seems to me‘

that when you have three or four
backs with different running styles
filtering in and out of the backfield
and you still manage to gain
yardage, that’s a plus.

The offensive line has to be

commended for its job because ‘

blocking forjermaine Williams is
a stark contrast from blocking for
Curtis Martin or Tim Colicchio,
Kevin Williams, Glenn Deveaux,
et al.

So you think you
know everything
about contraception.
Have you heard
about film?

VCF“ Vaginal Contraceptive
Film is recommended by
thousands of gynecologists
across the country. A micro-
thin square of VCF begins to
dissolve instantly, delivering an
effective dose of non-oxynol 9,
the non-hormonal spermicide
most recommended by
doctors. You (or he) won't
even know VCF is there. VCF
Vaginal Contraceptive Film has
been used over 10 million
times by women who want
protection against pregnancy
as well as enjoyment. Look for
VCF in all THRIFT drug stores.

clubs from Pittsburgh, Maryland
and Northern Virginia.

Pitt opened up the double-
elimination tournament on the
down side with a 6-3 loss to the
Northern Virginia Lacrosse Club.
But the Panthers rebounded with
two decisive victories against
Washington & Jefferson and the

University of West Virginia-

. Wesleyan. Those victories moved

Pitt into the quarter-finals, where
it faced the University of Buffalo,
a team Pitt had yet to beat.
Leading S—4 with a minute to
play, the Panthers looked as if
they were going torshake the
monkey off their backs and head

to the next round. But Buffalo
spoiled Pitt’s upset bid by scoring
two goals down the stretch to
win 6-5. The loss eliminated Pitt
from the tournament.

squad. Their team speed is outstanding. With
Kenny Smith at the point, Houston has one of the
league’s quickest guards.

If the Rockets are to contend in this division,
they'll need a solid contribution from their bench
—— something they lacked last season. The team’s
overall outside shooting must get better as well
as its free-throw percentage (.741 last season).

That other Texas hoops team — the Dallas
Mavericks— is a group that’s looking to answer

a few questions. However the one that comes
to mind is who will replace Roy Tarpley.
Tarpley was banned from the league for violatin g
its substa‘nce—abuse policy. Rookie Doug Smith
could provide immediate help, as could another
rookie, 7—fOOter Donald Hodge. Seven~foot,
two-inch, 280—pound James Donaldson led the
team in rebounds and blocked shots last season.

"Ms. Maya Angelou is hailed as
one of the greatest voices of

contemporary literature and as a
remarkable Renaissance woman." '

 

The team began its fall season‘

ll’?

again in the spring, when they
will be defending their Allegheny
Lacrosse League championship.
Last year the team finished with a
10-6 record (9-1 in the league) on
its way to the title — its second in
two years.

Since participation in the fall
season is for exhibition, it is not
required that all players attend.
For this reason, Neft stated that “it *5;
is tough to know where we are
right now. I do expect _to finish
first again, though.”

The strongest part of this year’s
Pitt team will be its experience.

Captains Tim Kenkle, Lee

' -Stember and Daryl Schmitt will

lead a veteran Panther squad that
only lost two players from last
season. The team will also see
about 15 new faces to add to its’
depth.

This team does come with some
weaknesses, explained Neft. “Our
biggest problem is with our
practices. They are weak. We
need to set some new rules.”

Come spring, you can expect
to see the Panthers play a run-
and—gun style. This team will score
plenty of goals. While it may be -

' well-suited for high—scoring

contests, the team will be
balanced by an aggressive
defense that likes to get physical.

Practices will resume at the
beginning of January,‘ and you
can see the Panthers in action at
the end of February in their home
games at Pitt Stadium.

and Fat Lever. All three have
been playing in the league for a
while and know (and have) what
it takes to win.

If Dallas is to be successful, it
must rebound from Tarpley’s loss.
He averaged 20 points and- 11
rebounds, so either White or
Williams will have to fill his shoes.
Even though the -backcourt is
solid, the lack of a dominant big
man will prevent them from
making any noise.

The Denver Nuggets may be
the league’s most improved team.
They’ll definitely better last
season’s 20-62 record. The
Nuggets have several new faces
on their roster. They traded point

guard Michael Adams to
Washington for a first-round draft
choice, which they used to select
Temple’s Mark Macon, who is
still unsigned.

The biggest addition (in more
ways than one) is 7-2 center
Dikembe Mutombo, who gives
them a prominent force in the
middle as an intimidator and a
shot—blocker.

Speed—wise, this team is one
of the league’s fastest. However
it’s also the youngest and least
experienced club in the league.
Chris Jackson needs to boost his
numbers from a year ago.

The Minnesota Timberwolves
have a new coach in Jimmy
Rodgers, who replaces Bill

‘ Musselman. They appear to be

solid at the point with Pooh
Richardson handling the chores.
The ‘Wolves also appear solid at

the center position. Seven—foot,

three—inch Randy Breuer heads
that group. However 7-footer
Felton Spencer should get the
starting nod. Rookie Luc Longley
(7-2) should also see plenty of
action in his first year.

This team lacks impact players
at the power forward and shooting
guard positions. Tony Campbell
led the team in scoring last season
(21.8) and will contribute once
again. Tyrone Corbin is also a
solid performer.
