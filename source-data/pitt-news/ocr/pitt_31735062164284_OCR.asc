Student Affairs Sets
Agenda for 1 964-65
Following Meeting

. By JOSEY GROSSMAN

The Student Affairs Committee outlined its agenda for

\ the year Saturday in line with its general concern “for the

development of the student as a whole person,” one of the

ﬁve goals the Chancellor calls his aims for the University.

The full-day workshop centered on the channeling and utili-

zation of student interest in University affairs which has

beenprompted by the increase in residents and dormitory
expansion.

Earmarked for one of the ﬁrst meetings is a discussion on recent

,_ registration and advising problems. The student members speciﬁcally

requested that Chairman Alan Rankin, assistant chancellor of stu-

The committee also outlined discussions on facilities 1n ‘pro-

Med Fraternity
Continues Film

Series This Year

Alpha Epsilon Delta, the hon-

Beta Beta Beta, the honorary bio-
logical fraternity, will continue
their “Advances in Medicine”
series again this year.

Their first ﬁlm in the new
series will be held next Monday
from 12 to 12:50 p.m. in L9, Clapp
Hall.

Dr. George J. Magovern, a
noted cardiac surgeon, will pres-
ent this ﬂlm and entertain ques-

tions on the new frontiers in_

heart surgery.

Republican Vice-Presidential Candidate
William E. Miller kicked off his party’ s
Pittsburgh-area campaign last Friday by
blasting the Democratic Party with an at-
tack that ranged from Vietnam to Bobby
Baker.

With all but the third balcony of the ‘Syria
Mosque ﬁlled, the 3,500-plus crowd whistled,
cheered and booed Mr. Miller's attacks against
the Kennedy-Johnson Administrations.

Accuses Democrats

Miller accused the Democrats of ”leading this
country into four wars in this generation. If the
Democrats are not turned away from office this
fall, the peace will be threatened once more,” he
continued.

The reason for this, the upstate New York
Congressman explained, is that “the Democrats
don’t understand Communism and its Godless
ideology.” Barry Goldwater does he said, and
“knows that only through strength and ﬁrm-
ness in foreign police is the peace kept.”

_ Two words, “reason” and “in ,-” _
pervaded the speeches by Al Schlosser, irman

of the University's Chapter of Young Ci&ns for

Johnson and Humphrey, and by Dr. Richard Cato  " H

tam, associate professor of political science.

Comparing the attitude embodied in these by; 

. words to the “unbridled emotions” of the Republi-

can attitude,\both speakers stressed that the Dem-
ocratic candidates stand for “the American pro-
gressive tradition.”
. Democracy at Issue

The democratic process itself is at issue in
this election, Dr. Cottam contended. Goldwater,
he maintained, offers only “the freedom to con-
form.” Goldwater’s stand is really “revolutionary”:
it “approaches police state control in the civil
rights movement,” sanctions “removal of the bar-
gaining position of unions,” leads to the “elim-
ination of the small farmer,” and amends the basic
American ideal of “innocent until proven guilty.”

fw...msm* ; 

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN ,
Last month Ann McDonnell Ginevan, . an April grad-
uate of the University and a bride of two weeks, found her-
self the “mother” of 158 college women. Surprisingly_

 enough, Mrs. Ginevan volunteered for this responsibility;

a former mentor and senior assistant, she applied for her

' I present position as head resident of McCormick Hall upon

graduation.

Mrs. Ginevan, a sociology major, is now working for
her master's degree in counsellor education. As head resi-
dent, she is in charge of girls who are former classmates
and sorority sisters. However, "the girls she knows have taken her
position into consideration and have individually asked her to re-
frain from showing any partiality.

Miss Savina S. Skewis, Associate Dean of Women, was particular-
ly anxious for Mrs. Ginevan to serve in" her present capacity. She
stressed that an elderly woman runs the risk of presenting a “mother

_ image” in her relationship with the girls. These same girls develop

more self-reliance when they are dealing with someone so near their

‘own age, such as the 22-year-old Mrs. Ginevan.

Advantages Weigh Heavy

Trimester Rieeeiues  
F acvorable Comments

Students, faculty, and administration at the University
of Michigan and the University of Pittsburgh reacted fav-
orably to the trimester system, according to surveys taken
at both schools. .

The Student Government Trimester Committee at the
University surveyed one out of four undergraduate stu-
_dents. Out of the 1,222 students who received a question-
naire from the committee, 636 replied.

Fifty-ﬁve per cent of the one eighth of students who
replied to the survey would choose the trimester calendar
if they enrolled at a college today. Twenty-ﬁv‘e per cent preferred
the. semester program. A greater number of students favor the tri-
mester calendar over the semester program after nearly four years
under the new system.

Quality of Instruction Equal
. Although the trimester system is preferred, 64 per cent of the
Liberal Arts students had not attended a third trimester. Forty-nine
per cent considered the quality of instruction in the spring trimester
the same .as the fall and winter trimesters.

Michigan Daily, the University of Michigan’s newspaper,
surveyed campus opinion and found that 99 per cent of the fresh-
men, almost 90 per cent of the other students, and more than 75

’ per cent of the faculty members polled preferred the new cal-
endar which began last fall. _

The results of the Michigan Da.ily’s. poll showed a favorable re-
action to the new calendar with the long summer vacation and study
free-Christmas vacation. The students thought teachers didn’t adjust
their syllabi to the new system, and piled on the untouched work

. the ﬁnal weeks.

Higher Averages »
.. Forty-one per cent of the Michigan students found no difference
in mastering their courses and 53 per cent had a higher overall aver-
_age. Those who indicated lower grades dropped an average .027.
The freshmen found the trimester program satisfactory. They
had not experienced college under the semester program so the
trimester system was easy.
Before the trimester calendar began, Michigan students and
teachers predicted disaster and thought that the University was trad-
ing intellectual excellence for mass production. The results of the
survey is the popularity of the trimester calendar. The administra-
‘tion questions not the popularity but what the trimester does to
education. .

. Michigan’s trimester system is only one year old and has no
improvements. The University’s found 50 per cent of the students
satisﬁed with improvements in the trimester during the past four
years. Future improvements include an expanded variety of courses
during the spring term, equal quality in the courses, increased ﬁ-
nancial assistance, and complete knowledge of the advantages and
disadvantages of the trimester calendar.

Spirit Drive

Student Government has launch-
ed a drive to generate interest
and support for a Spirit Award
to measure enthusiasm of organi-
zations on campus.

President John Vrana an-
nounced that competition for the
award will include participation
in speciﬁed University activities.

A calendar, a set of rules, and
an application forinlwill be dis-
tributed to all qualiﬁed organi-
zations who wish to participate.

Chairmen Solicit Participation

Co-chairmen Barbara Goodman
and John Dugan have asked hon-
oraries and smaller groups, which
might not be able to participate
in the formal competition because
of ﬁnancial restrictions, to ex-
press their interest and support
through a show of posters, ver-
bal support, and appearance .at
the speciﬁed functions.

Vrana stated that while the im-
mediate goal of individual par-
ticipants may be recognition for
their organization, the primary-
purpose of the Spirit Award is to
foster uniﬁed ‘campus spirit.

The Student Affairs "meeting Saturday was a 9:30 to 5 proposition, but the stu-

V dent leaders didn’t care. They ‘finally had enough time to vent student attitude, and
a better yet, the administrators were most receptive and apparently willing to set up a

fall agenda to clear up some of the major student problems on campus.

But one of the most interesting facets of the meeting was the discussion that
prompted the agenda items, an analysis of the changing nature of the student body
from one of indifferent commutors to a largely enthusiastic resident crowd.

’ This is not to say that commutors, by definition are indifferent, just that it

; takes a lot more initiative to participate or even be concerned about a place you
. , can escape at 5 o'clock. Nor is this to say that resident students are by deﬁnition

enthusiastic. It is simply easier and more contagious to have living units of students

with similar academic problems and a common social base.

Dr. Alan Rankin quoted the increase in resident students as soaring from four
per cent eight years ago to 64 per cent this year. And that includes two-thirds of a
freshmen class automatically instilled with neophyte excitement.

One ‘example points up this degree of‘ change. The editors and business man-

- -agers of publications receive some ﬁnancial help because it has long been recognized
‘:that the time they spend prevents them from earning money at another job. The
..:..president of Student Government and the chairman of the Student Union Board re-
 -ceived no such allocation, and still do -not, because these jobs just did not require the
« same time and admistration. '
But now the president of Student Government is representing a more demand- . '

ing student body, a group that is concerned about its campus future and doesn’t hesi-
tate to complain and demand recognition for its interests. And the chairman of the
Board has found planning leisure time activity for the campus student as necessary
as formal lectures and Friday night dances. ‘
The very nature of the Student Affairs Committee is indicative of this new
breed. ,"And after the discussion Saturday, the administration seems more aware that
this department of the University is growing as fast asvlany other, and that a co-

operative effort is no longer a projection but a necessity.

By LARRY BERNFELD
Last of A Series

The treatment of music
as a social phenomenon ap-
pears to be a legitimate and
pursuit. ‘The

general criteria of what is
_ good music now includes

‘social factors. Nowhere are
these social criteria more
evident than in the public
non-acceptance of rock-’n’-
roll.

cians turned

of fast dancing music. Be-
bop continued into the ﬁf-
ties and the search for the
new beat went on. R ‘in’ R
ﬁlled the dancing gap.
Most rock ’n’ rollicolo-
gists will date the effective
beginning of the Big Beat
back to 1955 and that now

« classic disc by Bill Haley

and the Comets -—— “Rock
Around the Clock.”
Musically, the construc-
of early rock ’n’ roll was
simple —— a steady on-the.

. beat drum beat, a chord pro-

gression that went tonic sub-
dominant-dominant (other-
wise known as the standard
one-four-five), some form of
melody (though not always
very important), and a gy-
rating group of performers
(men, women, and what-
have-you).

IN THE YEARS that

I have passed, the style has

mellowed. The Latin Ameri-
can rhythm of the Bossa

‘ Nova and the off-the-beat

syncopation ‘of the Frug
have provided variation to
the steady twist beat. The
harmonies are more subtle

 and the singers are begin-
ning to veer away from a *

st.eady diet of parallel
thirds. You can hear the new
sound at least three times
an hour on most radio sta-
tions in the music of the
most popular group today.
Yes, the Beatles. Yet most
people seem to think that
the four mop-heads are the
biggest atrocity since Atil-
la and the Huns.

The general protest in
1964 is less against the
sound of the Big Beat than
against the social currents
which both the music and
the. performers stir up.

Rock ‘n’ Roll has all the
magnetism of a mass move-
ment. The shrieks, the hys-
teria, the swooning at the
big rock shows constitute a
total commitment to the
movement by the confused
security - seeking, teenager
(mostly girls in this partic-
ular instance). The music
breeds tension and excite-
ment while at the same time
paradoxically serving as a
release for the pent-up emo-
tion of the American youth.

ADULTS attribute more
curses to rock ’n’ roll than
to either the bubonic plague
or Oil Can Harry. R ‘n’ R
has become the whipping
post for everything from
juvenile delinquency to ear-
ly marriages. Unfortunately
most critics don’t look past
their noses to “The World
Outside” in attributing all
sin to R ’n’ R.

Surely Rock ‘n’ Roll has <

some of the faults attribut-
ed. It is loud. To those who
refuse to listen it will sound
all the same. The dances are
often highly‘ suggestive.
Many teenagers lose them-
selves in the hypnotic trance
of the movement to the det-
riment of thir school work
and other activities.

Yet the critics are con-.

fusing cause and effect. Is
R ’n’R a cause of this gen-
eration’s many_problems or
is it rather an effect of the
confusion that surrounds

t0daY’$ Youth ‘.Th_e»em'pha is .

    

on conforming to a stand-
ard of belonging; the ap-
peals of Madison Avenue;
the Italian movies which the
adults call art; and yes,
trite or subconscious as it

may be, a fear of the atomic -
age -— the year of the bomb. .

BY CLASSIC’ MUSICAL
standards R ’n’ R. often does
not appeal to the trained
ear, technically or aesthet-
ically. The fact remains,
however, that there is more
than “just.musi'c for the
body and the feet” — if one
cares to listen. An honest
reappraisal of one’s criti-
cisms of Rock ‘n’ Roll will

likely reveal a strong social ‘

basis which supercedes cri-
ticism of the music itself.
The traditionalist’s criti-
cism of jazz in the light: of
the “criteria of good music”
is not substantive. The class-
icits have not always agreed
on what constitutes good
music. They have left them-
selves open to redefinition
in the past, however stub-
bornly. An appreciation of
jazz, begins with respect for
an attempt to alter the stat-
us quo——in the tradition of
Tchaikovsky and Debussy.

/ At this point it should
be more apparent that a
parallel problem exists in
the acceptance of classical
music by many jazz enthus-
iasts and Rock ’n’ Roll fans.
Such a point of View is ob-
viously a narrow one and
prevents a full appreciation
of music as an art form.

Music as a discipline is
wide enough to encompass
many schools of thought.
An attempt to understand
and a willingness to listen

will reveal significant and

“good” music in each divi-
sion of the art.

pain is ours;»it belongs to us, it terrorizes us. For it is’
we who conspired; we who huddled together and giggled
when she came by, alone.

SHE’S COME by since, but it’s
not bothered me. I’ve been enthralled
with the neon lights,‘ drunk with the
fraternity parties, absorbed with the

It’s not bothered me a bit; I know}
howto singbeautiful lullabies. _

We share something. I know that

breathes. Yes, we certainly share it.

 

Miss Delaney
If on1y—but I'll never venture into the darkness. Terror.
awaits where the streetlights end. Terror, like an ugly,
fleshy weed, like a grasping, squirming squid. Terror in
the murkiness. Terror. Oh God, please let’s talk about it.

PLEASE, WHY CAN’T we talk? I know that we‘

could have done it before; we three, when she came by.
She wanted to, but we were contemptuous. She was lonely;
now we three are alone. Now she’s out there too. Out
there in the darkness, breathing along ‘with my innate lone-

it alone. You must come along. I know it’s in your dark-

now than just loneliness; now it’s swollen with giggles.
She’s giggling back. We, we with our smugness, our lazi-

What can anyone say
about “Hamlet”? More has
been Written about Hamlet
than about any real or ﬁc-
tional character in history

save three. Only Jesus, Napoleon,

and Hamlet’s own creator, Shakes-
peare, have inspired more com-,
ment on the written page.

Today and tomorrow, Septem-
ber 23rd and 24th, Pittsburghers
will have a chance to see our
era’s most notable Hamlet-—that
played by Richard Burton.

I can't say for, certain what
the effect of “electronovision”

will be, but on stage this pro- -

duction was a deeply moving ex-
perience. Something will no doubt
be lost in the filming, but any-
one who missed the stage version
should not miss the chance to
see the most talked about actor
of our time play the most famous
role of all time.

The Masterpiece

After all is said that can be
said about “Hamlet,” after dis-
cussing its genius and shortcom-
ings, there is still the aura of
magic which can not be deﬁned.
It, above all plays, has the won-
der which one feels when enrap-
turned by a great painting. “I
know this is great,” one ponders,

“but all explanation fails to tell

completely w .”

“Hamlet” may not be as
dramatically perfect as “Mac-
beth” nor as tragically moving
as “King Lear,”‘ but more than
any of Shakespeare’s master-
pieces it has the mysterious
wonder that hynotize both ac-
tors and audience. Nine out of
ten people, if asked to quickly

 

Cooke Advocates
Support of Party

Dr. Edward Cooke, associate
professor of political science,
urged the September 18 meeting
of the University Young Republi-
cans to support party nominees
if party government means any-
thing in the United States.

Dr. Cooke, adviser to the
Young Republicans, urged the
Supper Room audience to “get
interested in politics at the grass
roots level.” Doing political work,
he remarked, is “a tremendous
education.”

The University chapter of the
Young Republicans, Dr. Cooke
said, have _“always had- a going
organization.” He further stated
that more opportunity exists to
get ahead through the Young
Republican organization than
through that of the Young. Dem-
ocrats.

of 100,000 Citizens for Gold-

— a tremendous and haunting
voice; a ﬁery yet subtle creative
talent; neither as polished, as
Gielgud, as versatile as Oliver,
nor as dedicated as either. Once
again, however, there is a mys-
tery, a desire to hear Burton’s
voice, to watch him in a great
role,

The Young Burton
It would have been exctiting to

have seen him as Hamlet a few '

years ago in London where, as

on Broadway, he holds the rec- A

ord for the longest run of the
classic show. When younger and
more vibrant, when not affected
by a publicity mad affair with a

Hollywood siren, he must have’

been at the height of his powers.

This production, directed by
John Gielgud, is interesting for
other features also. The much
debated “rehearsal dress”
neither adds nor detracts from
the play. The cast is solid but
not brilliant. Alfred Drake as
Claudius and Ellen Herlie as
Gertrude are quite good. Hume
Cronin is remembered as a
well acted Polonius.

Of course no one can really
shine in “Hamlet” except Ham-
let. No .actor in his deepest heart,
does not dream of doing the
role. In whatever time or style,
in a great production or a ter-
rible one, the sheer magnitude of
the ‘ character impresses the au-
dience and inspires the actor.

Today and tomorrow at 2 and
8 p.m., ﬁve Pittsburgh theaters
(the Stanley, Downtown, and the
Manor, in Squirrel Hill, are
closest to the University) will
feature the movie.

THE BROKEN BACK
WHEN YOUR name is Eric Crabtree, you're used to
big headlines. You’re used to people talking about how
fast you are. You’re used to people telling you how great
you were when you played for Monessen Hi‘gh School.

You’re used to making the big plays.

isn’t there anymore,” he said. “I don’t have to press the
way I did on the ﬁrst team. I don’t have to worry now
that they’ll take me out of the game if I make a mistake. .

C said.

You’re not used to being
on the second team, but
that’s where Crabtree is
now, playing right halfback
behind Bill Bodle.

“It’s my own fault. that
I’m on the second team,”
Crabtree explained. “I made
too many mistakes against
UCLA.” Then he enumerat-
ed, his head bent towards
the hand that counted his
mistakes. “I dropped a pass.
I fumbled. I missed a block.
I didn’t pick up my man on
defense. I let my man get
behind me . . : “He ran out
of fingers.

“It was the worst game
I ever played,” Crabtree
“After that they
dropped me down to the
second te.am._I guess that’s
where I’ll stay for the rest
of the season. And I guess
I deserved it.”

Crabtree thinks he might
be better running with the
second unit than with the
ﬁrst- unit. “The pressure

“Some guys do well under "pressure, like Bodle. I
can’t take it. I’m just not that way. Some guys play their
best when they put out 100 per cent. I can’t. When I do,

I just make mistakes.”

But Crabtree is too good for the third unit, so re-

I gardless of how he plays, he will not be demoted any
further. “The pressure is off now. Maybe now I can start
' playing the way I did last year.”

But even if Crabtree averages ﬁve yards per carry
again this year, he doesn’t think he will get back onto the
ﬁrst team. “I’m down here to stay now,” he said, staring
at his hands again. “I can pretty much forget about the
ﬁrst team. I just don’t have it in me.”

Crabtree then turned his thoughts to the Oregon
game this coming Saturday. “That’s the key game for
me. If I have a bad game there, I might as well forget
it. Like I said, I can’t come back. Once I get down, I’m
down. A bad day against Oregon could wipe me out

for the season.”

If you’re Eric Crabtree, you expect things to go your
way. And when they don’t, you’re puzzled, confused, and
depressed. But you still have talent. You’re 14 pounds
heavier than last year, and they say you should be a more
-3, powerful runner. If you just don’t quit, you can be a

’ great halfback.

day morning’s. scrimmage at Trees Field. The

By FRANK SMIZIK

The week off from practice without a game
should have done the Panther football team a lot of
good, but the team was hobbled more from the
practices than from the UCLA game. Pitt might
be the toughest team the Panthers face all year.

The his injury was the knee injury John Verk-
leeren received while playing defense in a scrim-
mage last week. Verkleeren, according to coach
John Michelosen, will be out for the season.

“We intend to move either Mike Rosborough
or Brian Generalovich up. In either case both boys
should see plenty of action,” said Michelosen.

No other serious injuries occured but Ray
Popp sustained an elbow injury in the scrim-
mage last Saturday. He was, however, up at
practice seemingly at full strength this week.
Bill Bodle was also slightly injured although he
is also now at full strength while Jim Jones
and Ron Linaburg are still out with ankle in-
juries. .

Because of these injuriespthe team hasn't been
at full strength and Michelosen seems even more
pessimistic than usual. “I’d like to have a whole
team here so thatl can see if our timing is better
or if we’re improving any.”

“I can’t say if there are going to be any changes
in the line-up but the way it looks now there may
be.” The most probable changes are Bill Bodle
at right halfback replacing Eric Crabtree and Bob
Sorochak replacing Bernie LaQuinta at right guard,
although Michelosen hasn't said anything.

The Panther defense which could use a little
improvement will have a lot to contend with Sat--
urday night in quarterback Bob Berry, supposed-

ly the best in the West. In the scrimmage on
Saturday, freshman Bob Bazylak was running
Oregon plays and was emulating Berry. He broke
through for several long gains.

“I suppose Oregon could be better than UCLA,” I

said Michelosen, “at least they have Ben'y and
he led the West in statistics which means they’ll
be tough.”

Coach Len Cassanova says, “Berry does every-
thing extremely well and he’s a great leader, but
most of all he’s a winner.” Fred Mazurek will
again have the same position of being compared
with another great quarterback in Saturday night's
game.

This week the Eastern teams were unveiled
as Navy and Penn State tangled and Syracuse
and Boston College also met. Michelosen, how-
ever, isn’t making any predictions from last
Saturdays results. Syracuse, the best in the East,
was upset by Boston College.

“I don’t want to compare Pitt with any of the
other teams, but both Penn State and Navy looked
very good and Gary Wydman impressed me in
the second half. I still think we have a long wa
to go to be the equal of both teams.” -

“The main differences in Navy and Penn State
is their lines. Last year Navy had the bigger line;
this year it is Penn State, but both are good
squads.”

Navy’s victory may be a blessing for the Pan-
ther’s if they prove to be in the running for- a
bowl game when the Navy game comes around.
If the Panthers are able to beat Navy then the
Penn State game won’t mean as much to the bowl

Booters Sharpen Up For West Chester

By BILL CABIN
Although the soccer team de-
feated Frostburg handily last Sat-

’-:/urday, coach Leo Bemis feels that

the ‘booters will need extensive
practice before their home open-
V er with West Chester on Satur-

' “day at Frick Park. Bemis said,

“We didn’t ﬁnish several thrusts,
and we'll need some work before
the West Chester game.”

"'7 As Bemis said, “West Chester
is in a different class than Frost-
burg and it will be a much rough-
er game.” The facts justify Bemis’
comment on West Chester. The

I v‘«‘s-.:oreless wonders,” as coach
 el Lorback called his 1963

"'-‘squad, were not a potent offen-

e.,. sive team,’ but were one of the

' top three defensive teams in the
country, and reached the NCAA
’ quarter-ﬁnals.

In last-year's game, Pitt and

West Chester battled to a 1-1
tie. This year, however, Bemis
said, “We’ve got a more diver-
siﬁed attack, and -have the abil-
ity to shoot from both the out-
side and the inside.” West
Chester, however, only lost one
back which will give them vir-
tually the same type of defen-
sive unit they possessed last
year.

According to Lorback, the West
Chester offense “was cut into
heavily by graduation.” They lost,
their four starting linemen, and
will therefore be lacking players
with offensive experience.

This should ease the job of the
defense, but Bemis feels that the
booters are strong enough on de-
fense to withstand a strong of-
fensive attack. As he said, “We've
got good, experienced, big men

at fullbacks." These include let-

Bartalotta works out with the basketball team,
and this year he has intentions of making the jun-

Intramural Prog: am Plans
To Sponsor Judo Again

by GEORGE LIES  ,
Intramural director Leo Bemis has announced that the
intramural program will sponsor a judo _club for all inter-

ested students.

Although plans are still tentative for this year’s club,

Bemis plans to have Steve Mitro, one of last year’s co-

instructors back as an instructor
this year. The other instructor,
Warren Stumph, will not be back
this year.

Bemis commented on the
growth of the club, “We had
between 12 and 15 boys work-
ing out last year. This year,
many of those same boys and
many new ones have called my
office asking about the club. I
have talked to Mitro and he
says that the workouts should
begin before the end of the
month.”

“The problem with getting the
club started this year,” Bemis
continued, “is that we haven’t
had enough time to get organized.
Right now, I’m waiting for Mitro
to get in contact with last year’s
president" so that he and Mitro
can decide on" the days and the
times for the workouts.”

Last year the workouts were
held on Mondays, Wednesdays,

. and Fridays from six until eight

ed his own cause with a home

Turning to the use of atomic
jweapons, Miller continued his at-
,-tack on J ohnson’s foreign policy
,...by declaring that Goldwater nev-
H. er suggested turning nuclear
. weapons over to ﬁeld command-
." ers. What Goldwater has sug-
f ‘gested, Miller asserted, was to
f_ give control of tactical nuclear
‘weapons which “_a single GI can
 use” to the Supreme Commander

of NATO.

 Cites Use of Weapons

‘ These weapons would only be
"used in event of an enemy nu-
"clear attack. “Why S1101-11d 0111'
ﬂboys,” M.iller asked, “be sitting
__._ _ducks while someone is trying to

Tzwhile he is driving at 100 miles

,, ‘who isn't muzzled . . . agrees,"

T To make his Point clear on

who was being reckless on con-
_ trol of nuclear weapons, Mil-
-tier said that it was “Hubert
,_ Horatio Humphrey” who once
 suggested “turning the U. S.

Hits Humphrey

Miller struck closer to home by
opening his remarks with the
statement, “We’ve only been cam-
paigning two weeks and already
Hubert Humphrey resigned as
Vice-President of the Americans
for Democratic Action.

“We’ve only been campaign-
ing for two weeks and already
the Bobby Baker case is re-
opened.” The candidate’ con-
cluded his remarks by saying,
‘-‘And after all this Lyndon
Johnson stiH has the nerve to
say ‘let us continue’.” '

The unity theme was evident
as Pennsylvania Gov. William
W. Scranton introduced Miller by
saying, “This state administration
is 100 per cent .behind the na-
tional ticket as well as state and
local tickets.” It was marred,
however, by the introduction of
James Fulton, U. S. Congressman
from the South Hills district who

was greeted with scattered boost

and catcalls. Fulton has yet to
endorse the national ticket.

Schosser, also rejected Gold-
water’s “politics of progress.”
Paraphrasing the famous speech
. of v i c e-presidential nom-

inee Hubert Humphrey. Schlos-
ser listed ten major programs
for which a “great majority”
of both Republicans and Dem-
ocrats in the Senate voted
“yes”; but “Senator Goldwater
voted ‘no.”’

“It is my belief,” Schlosser pro-
claimed, amidst cheers and ap-

plause, “that in November, the-___

American people will overwhelm.
ingly say “NO” to Senator Gold-
water.”
Ten Programs Listed
The ten programs referred to-
six in domestic affairs and "four
in foreign aﬁairs—were the min-
imum wage, social security ex-
pansion, federal housing, anti-
poverty, limited trade with East-
ern Europe, trade expansion, the
test-ban treaty, the tax cut, civil
rights, and the Peace Corps. The
last Goldwater rejected as “a
haven for draft dodgers.”
Schlosser maintained that
Goldwater had “answers to
everything but solutions to
nothing.” Dr. Cottam reiter-
ated this, contending that “a
kick in the pants” is as deep
and as subtle as any of Golo
water's solutions go. For ex-
am,ple, how could Goldwater
expect to increase military
spending and cut» taxes, yet
still balance the budget, Dr.
Cottam questioned. ‘
