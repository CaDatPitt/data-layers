ing a busy dinner hour.

The Department of Food Services began
taking photos for the new “mag stripe” stu-
dent IDs this week, and officials say they
are optimistic the conversion for students
with meal plans and choice dollars will be
complete in "time for the start-of next
semester. ‘

This is provided students show up to get
their photos taken.

According to Ranae Brinza of the
Department of Food Services, approxi-
mately 800 students have had their photos
taken since the program started Monday

. morning. If all of the scheduled students

had shown up at their designated time, that
number should have been between 1,000 to
1,200.

“Many of the students seem to want to
wait until January,” Brinza said.

Beth Benz, also of the Department of
Food Services, strongly emphasized the
need for students to come and get their
photos taken during the scheduled period.

“We need to stress that if students do not
have their photo taken, they will not be

able to eat [in January],” she said. In addi-
tion, the residence hall stickers have been
changed, and after the first week of the
spring semester the old IDs will no longer
allow students access to their dorms.

Aside from a smaller turnout than expect-
ed, there have been no major problems
with the conversion process, according to

-'-Bri-nza. . . '

After having his photo taken, freshman
Louis DeFrete agreed that the entire
process was efficient.

“Things worked out well. There were no
problems, no wait  everything ran
smoothly,” he said.

“It’s real organized,” said Gabe
DeMajistre, a junior and McCormick Hall
resident. He received the schedule from
food services in the mail and went to get
his picture taken on his scheduled day.

Amy Gera, a senior and resident of
Holland Hall, also got the schedule and
came on her scheduled day. She came
expecting long lines but was surprised at
how fast the process was. .

“I was very surprised that there were no

lines. I was all done in about five minutes,”

National
AIDS quilt

The length is roughly 12 foot-
ball fields long. It weighs 36
tons and is made out of items
that range from jewelry, pho-

tographs and love letters, to «

Barbie Dolls, tennis shoes and
jock straps.

It brings together countries
like Cuba, Israel, South Africa,
Zambia and the United States.
Tennis player Arthur Ashe, rock
star Freddie Mercury and MTV
“Real World” star Pedro
Zamora are names recognized
by its visitors.

What is this massive world-
wide creation that nearly 6 mil-
lion people visit each year?

It is the AIDS Memorial Quilt
and you can see it Friday, Dec.
1, here on the Pitt campus.

In 1987, longtime gay rights
activist Cleve Jones spray-

painted the name of his friend,-

Marvin Feldman. onto a piece
of fabric. It was his desire to
remember his friend as a person
and not a statistic that inspired
Jones to give birth to the AIDS
Memorial Quilt and the Names
Project Foundation.

Catalyzed by a man’s grief
over his friend’s death. the quilt
has become a world-wide phe-
nomenon that has swept its way
into Pittsburgh.

Five monthsago. the NPF
officially created a chapter in
Pittsburgh called the Pittsburgh
Names Project. This organiza-
tion exists to help people in and

When Phi Sigma Pi rang J.
Dennis O’Connor’s doorbell
last year, he had no idea who it

- was. The co-ed national honor

fraternity was trick-or—treating.
But it didn’t want candy. It was
collecting canned goods as a
service project and had sent
out flyers in advance to the
neighborhood. After explain-
ing this to O’Connor, Pitt’s
then—chancellor said he didn’t
know the fraternity existed on
campus_.

Pitt’s chapter of Phi Sigma
Pi recently won an award at
the national convention in
Norfolk, Va., for most
improved new chapter. It got

Award by increasing corre-
spondence with the national
office and trying to start a_new
chapter at Carnegie Mellon
University.

“In the past year we have
worked hard and improved 342
percent,” said Terra Walker,
president of Phi Sigma Pi.
“Being awarded for hard work
in front of 600 people [at the
convention] is an incredible
experience.”

The stereotype may be that
you join an honorary organiza-
tion to build up your resume,
but according to Val Boyle
that’s not the case with Phi
Sigma Pi. Boyle is head of
public relations for the frater-
nity. She said that the fraternity

members hang out with each
other outside of activities.

“I joined it to build friend-
ships and that’s what I did.”
said Boyle.

She says the fraternity is
based on fellowship, leader-
ship and scholarship. Members
must maintain a 3.0 QPA and
participate in group activities.

“We work together to

improve our campus and our‘

community by participating in
diverse service projects,” said
Walker.

The group helps out with
events such as Hand-in—Hand.
a festival for handicapped chil-
dren. and Project Pittsburgh.
cleaning up the streets of
Oakland. But many projects

rating the Blind School for the
holidays. or adopting a high-
way.

The fratemity was originally
founded in 1916 in Central
Missouri State University. and
it currently has 59 chapters
across the United States. But
Pitt’s Alpha Omega chapter
wasn’t installed until Sept. 27.
1992. The Clarence
O’Williams award is the first
award Phi Sigma Pi has won.
since it is rather new.

“Phi Sigma Pi provides us
with agroup of friends. a
means of support and an outlet
to participate in worthwhile
projects." said Walker. “I hope
that this was the first in a long
succession of awards."

  World Events

LONDON — Britain and
Ireland broke an impasse con-
cerning the disarmament of the
IRA. which had stalled peace
talks in Northern Ireland. only
hours before President Clinton

was scheduled to arrive in-

London yesterday.

It wasn’t immediately clear
whether the action would be
acceptable to Sinn Fein, the
party that supports_ the IRA. or
to the pro-British Unionist par-
ties which represent the
Protestant majority in Northern
Ireland.

In Dublin the government
confirmed the agreement, and
details are to be released in an
upcoming news conference.

The Irish media is calling
President Clinton’s stop in
Northern Ireland today,
“Clinton’s Mission
Impossible” — a one-day blitz

year, were killing one another.

KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel
—— Lebanese guerillas fired
rockets on northern Israel in
the fiercest cross—border
assault in two years, forcing
tens of thousands of Israelis to
retreat to bomb shelters on
Tuesday.

Israeli warplanes responded
by pounding guerrilla strong-
holds while the prime minister
put the blame on Syria for the
renewed violence, claiming it
could have ended the attack.
No one was killed, but six peo-
ple were injured and there was
extensive property damage.

The attack, followed by
fierce talks, sparked renewed
fears that the event could sink
Israel-Syria peace efforts.
Syria controls much of

Quilt
°From page 1

near the Pittsburgh area create panels of their own
to add to the quilt.

“When seen, it makes an impact,” co—chair
Chuck Emma said.

The quilt has become a healing and powerful
symbol of the AIDS epidemic. Chapters like PNP
use the quilt as a tool in efforts to bring an end to
the AIDS epidemic by making it public.

Made up of panels created by individuals with
AIDS or family members who lost loved ones to
the disease. the quilt sends a strong message to
anyone whose eyes have fallen upon it.

“The people on these panels jump out at me and
tell me something,” Emma said. “They say ‘I was
here and now I’m not.”’

In commemoration for World AIDS.Day, the
PNP will show a portion of the AIDS Memorial
Quilt in Forbes Quadrangle. The theme of this
year’s campaign is “Shared Rights, Shared
Responsibilities.”

The message is to underscore the global

response to AIDS. lt’s selected because all peo-
ple, regardless of race, gender or sexual orienta-
tion, “have the right to be able to avoid HIV
infection. the right to health care and the right to
be treated without discrimination,” John Paul
Eros. secretary and media coordinator of PNP,
said.

Eros said he hopes the quilt will be the key to

she said.

She was not as happy,
however. with her new
photo.

‘‘It was ugly. but that’s all
right. My last one was ugly,
too.” she said.

Pictures for the new IDs
will be taken through Dec.
15. The photo booths, locat-
ed in the Towers lobby, are

open Monday through
Friday, from 8:30 a.m. until
5 p.m. Tuesdays and

Wednesdays they are open
until 7 p.m.. and Friday is a
make-up day. Students are
encouraged to come on their
scheduled day, but according
to Brinza. nobody will be
turned away if they show up
at a time other than when
they were scheduled.

“We want lines,” she said.

The new IDs can be picked
up in the Towers lobby
beginning Jan. 2. Students
who do not have their photo
taken by Dec. 15 must go to
Thackeray Hall to get their
new IDs.

All students must turn in
their old ID before they can
obtain a new card. The stu-
dents who have lost their old
card will have to pay a $10
replacement fee.

something. They say ‘I was
here and now I’m not.”’

educating the youth because he thinks they are the
“voices of the future.”

“We have an inside joke among us in the chap-
ter,” Eros said. “We say to the kids, ‘If you meet
someone you think is good enough to die for, give
us a call because we would like to meet ‘em.’”

It is comments like that which Eros and his col-
leagues hope will make an impact on today’s kids.

Eros, 26, has been living with HIV for eight
years. He said he has not yet seen the quilt but is
scared in anticipation of when he will stand
before a complete display of it next year on Oct.
11 in Washington.

“I’m sure I’ll bawl my head off because, literal-
ly, some day I will become a part of it.” he said.
“That scares me.”

With an opening ceremony at 10 a.m., a reveal-
ing of a partial display of the quilt will begin the

day’s events. Thirty—two panels will be on dis-
play, including a panel that represents Jean
Manasterski, the man who created and funded the
Ukrainian Room in the Cathedral of Learning.

Other panels include one created by the College
of General Studies and a signature square from
the Pitt Program Council of 1990. The signature
square is a panel that contains messages from
council members to loved ones who died from
AIDS.

In addition to the panels on display, a dedica-

tion ceremony for new panels will be held at 6

p.m.
“Hopefully, one of the panels dedicated will be
mine,” Eros said.

PNP expects between five and seven panels to
be added to the quilt.

“We’re praying we will get more,” Eros said.
“And God only knows how many more will be
dedicated world—wide.” .

Throughout the‘day there will be musical enter-
tainment, video tape programs and the “reading of
names.”

“Every person that has died of AIDS and is rep-
resented on the quilt will be announced through-
out the day,” Emma said. '

World AIDS Day is in its 10th year but is just
starting to be commemorated in Pittsburgh.

“This is a beginning for Pittsburgh. This thing
will grow and become a tradition,” Emma said.

Even one is toomany

How many times have you read about the countless cases of
domestic abuse which happen every day‘? You see them on the
news every so often. but not as often as it happens. For one
reason or another. abuse is considered taboo to speak about in
"polite" company. Whether people who know just don’t want
to get involved or they don’t think it could ever happen to
them or they say how sad it is and then forget three minutes
later when their favorite sitcom starts. abuse is often ignored.

When we (/0 hear about cases of abuse it is usually only after
it is too late to do anything about it. Husbands killings wives.
girlfriends killing boyfriends. parents killing children — these
are the cases we hear about. But by that time someone is
already dead.

' Recently in New York. 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo was bru-
-tally. violently and horribly murdered. Her mother was arrest-
ed and indicted for the little girl’s death. This was not a case
where a parent ‘accidentally hit a child too hard (though that is
no more excusable). According to testimony from E1isa”s five

_ "brothers and sisters, the little girl had been beaten with a ham-

mer, hung from a rope and allowed to swing by the neck as her
brother and sister watched, burned countless times by ciga-
rettes and sexually assaulted with a hairbrush. The child was
only six.

Even worse than Elisa’s horrible death is the fact that people
knew the girl was being abused, but did nothing about it. New
York’s Child Welfare Administration had been involved with
Elisa’s case, but let it slip through the cracks. School adminis-
trators at the public school Elisa attended had noticed the girl
was “walking strangely and was bruised” (New York Post.
Nov. 28). Yet they did nothing. Elisa’s father had fought for
custody, but family courts turned their backs to the abuse when
they awarded Elisa to her mother because her mother had
graduated from a drug treatment program. Neighbors who had
heard the girl’s screams for help did nothing to intervene. (One
mentioned having heard the screams, but had wanted to go
back to sleep because it was late.) '

Obviously, the people who were responsible for Elisa

Izquierdo’s death are the people who beat her. But a lot of

other people also share some of the responsibility. The courts
that gave Elisa to her mother after she had been taken away
once before share the blame. The case workers from CWA
who failed to fully investigate reports of Elisa’s abuse share
the blame. The neighbors who went back to sleep every night
for three weeksafter being wakened by a child’s screams for
help share the blame. The system failed Elisa miserably, and
now she is dead. Her death could likely have been prevented if
any of these people had done their jobs well.

But even these people are not as much to blame as are those
in charge of the administration. Other incidents like this have
happened in the past, and every time the powers-that-be claim
they have learned their lessons and that changes will be made.
But those changes are never made. Child abuse and abuse-
‘related death should be placed on the top—priority list of things
to deal with. Even one death is one too many.

Facing the morality crisis head on

Does the name Toronto
Patterson ring a bell to you? No?
Well, allow me -toclue you in on
this man’s claim to fame.

On Friday. Nov. 17. Mr.
Patterson was convicted of
killing his 25-year-old cousin
and her two children. aged 6 and
3. for the sake of acquiring this
relative’s gold- and chrome-plat-
ed wire wheels. What makes this
case so incredible, however.
isn’t the heinous crime itself.

What makes this case so
incredible is that you probably
have never heard of it.

“Patterson” should be as much
of a household name as
“Dahmer” is. but because the
number of murders in this coun-
try has grown to such horrific
levels and have become 
senseless as the one above, it
will become lost as just another
statistic. in a bloody tidal wave.

It has been saidby many that
this country is going through a
moral crisis. Plain and simple, it
is. I’m not even going to attach

an “in my humble opinion” to

that one.

This raises. then, the key ques-
tion: why is this such a revela-
tion to many? If this crisis is
really in effect, why have so
many people chosen to not rec-
ognize it and instead make
excuses? The answer, I believe,
sadly, lies in politics.

Most of the charges of a
sunken moral ship come from
the right. The left then charges
that the right is blaming all of
the country’s problems on
homosexuality, abortion, lack of
prayer in schools and whatever
else does not fit perfectly into
the Fundamentalist utopia. Well,
they are right, somewhat. The
right definitely does include
these in their cultural offensive.
So in a pleasant no—compromise
attitude. the left charges that it
has nothing to do with a lack of
values, and has to do more with
economic and social conditions
that drive this atmosphere. The
right may be pushing things too
far in what they include in their
“cultural decay” arguments, but
saying that declining values are

Chesnavich

not the issue at all is throwing
out the baby with the bath water.
and on top of that. the counter-
explanations are simply full of
it.

. The first of these is the race
issue. You see. when a black
man shoots a white pizza deliv-
ery man for his 10 bucks. it is
driven by the social divisions
between these two races dating
back a score of generations. and
is understandable. Bullocks. The
surge in black—on-black violence
alone is proof that this is not a
valid answer (all of the actors in
the Patterson case. to note. were
black). Don’t think that I’m
reversing this argument and
blaming any one race. Rather. I
think that trying to pin race
down as the culprit only makes
matters worse.

A second argument is that
poverty is driving the rise. For
starters, in 1989. 38 percent of
those classified as “poor” owned
their own homes. 14 percent
owned two or more cars and
22,000 had heated swimming
pools or hot tubs. Additionally.
thanks to the drug wars, many of
the “underclass” have an
untaxed income which will
exceed anything I'll make for
quite a few years to come. The
poor simply are not that poor.
and not nearly enough to support
this theory.

More importantly. the wisdom
that poverty causes crime has
been recently coming under
some attack. The II1ve.s‘t()r ‘s
Bu.s'ine.s‘.s‘ Daily reported that it is
now becoming accepted that
poverty not only does not induce

_crime but is more a symptom of

it. I won’t repeat here all of the
details. but I will point out this:
between 1973 and I992. the
number of crimes per person
increased 45 percent. mid to say
the least. the amount of govern-
ment assistance did not decline
by any similar amount.
Additionally. any poverty—driven
explanation does little to explain
the 75 percent increase in rape
over the same time period.

What is saddest about these
arguments isn't that they both
remove blame from the perpe-
trator and place it on outside
conditions. Rather. it is that
instead of admitting their fallacy.
too many people hold onto them
just to not give into the "values“
debate. It simply isn’t worth it to
concede there might be some

‘advantages to teaching “Thou

shalt not commit murder" sini-
ply because of some other
“Thou shalt“ that might slip in
as well.

Well. I think it is about time
that someone who doesn’t think
that the cause lies in rap music
or Tarantino films spoke out
anyway and said. yes. we are
having a moral crisis in this
country. Respect for life and
property has been shot to hell.
and unlike many of my contem-
poraries. I don’t think there are
any easy explanations or
answers. I do "know. however.
that it cannot be ﬁxed until we
agree that it is an issue of lost
morals that must be returned.

Closing this piece. l’m
reminded of an incident last
summer involving firemen. This
is one group whose altruistic
reputation still seems fairly sta-
ble. So what exactly do we
make of the reported shots fired
at firemen who came to shut off
fire hydrants opened during the
summer‘?

I know at least what i mzrke of
it: something far too serious to
play politics over any more.

College basketball is ﬁlled
with great rivalries. and many
of them are within the state
boundaries. For example, there
are Duke-North Carolina and
Kentucky—Louisville.

The rivalries seldom occur
outside state lines. Usually. they
are played within three miles of
each other.

Last night at the Civic Arena.
Pitt’s men’s and women’s bas-
ketball teams faced off against a
school they’re familiar with.
Duquesne. in the inaugural
"The City Game.” It was an
event put on by Dapper Dan
Charities. with $2.50 from each
ticket sold going to the Boys
and Girls Club of Western
Pennsylvania. helping them
fund youth inner—city basketball
leagues. .

Although the it was the first
"City Game.” these teams are
no stranger to each other.

For the men. it was the 64th
meeting between the two, dat-
ing back to 193. Pitt leads the
all-time series 35-29 and has
won 18 of the last 21.

\ Pitt's win also spoiled the
debut of Scott Edgar on the
Dukes’ sideline. The Penn Hills
native came to Duquesne after
coaching four years at Murray
State, where he led the Racers
to two NCAA tournament
berths.

The Lady Panthers weren’t as
fortunate, losing to the Lady
Dukes for the first time ever.
Trixie Wolf ’s basket in the last
five seconds gave Duquesne a
55-53 victory and ensured the
3-foot gold winner’s trophy will
reside for its first year at the
other end of Forbes Avenue

The Pitt and Duquesne
women’s rivalry dates back to
‘.75-’76. the Lady Dukes’ first
season of varsity play. The Lady
Panthers won that one. 105-35.

In upcoming years, the games
between these neighboring
schools aren’t likely to be that
lopsided. but instead will most
likely be like this year’s
women’s game — down to the
wire. '

Although it’s not to the
Kentucky-Louisville level yet.
the rivalry will continue to
grow.

Panthers roll over
Duquesne for first
win of the season

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Dapper Dan Charity’s attempt to rekindle the Pitt-Duquesne
rivalry fell flat after the Panthers jumped out to a quick 10-0 lead
last night.

The Dukes tried to regroup, but in the end. Pitt would never
trail. as the Panthers won their season opener 84-78 before
11.489 fans at the neutral Civic Arena.

“Pitt was a little bit bigger and a little bit stronger than I
thought they were,” first—year Duquesne coach Scott Edgar said.

That was evident from the opening tipoff. Forward Chad
Varga opened the game with an inside hoop, and soon after,
freshman Vonteego Cummings picked up a loose ball and went
coast-to-coast for a layup. After another Pitt steal, Andre Alridge
buried a three-pointer, and a minute later Cummings nailed
another three. ,

Before the Dukes could say “rivalry," they were down 10-0
with not even three minutes gone by.

Duquesne mounted a slight comeback thanks to Pitt’s three
minute and 20 second scoring drought. But the Dukes could only
cut the Panthers’ lead to five. which was the smallest of the half.

Behind Cummings’ nine first-half points. Pitt went into half-
time leading 35-25.

The Panthers had 18 first-half turnovers, but they outrebound-
ed Duquesne 27-10.

‘‘I told the kids at halftime they were tighter than eight ele-
phants in a Yugo.” Pitt head coach Ralph Willard said.

With Pitt leading 39-30 in the second half, the Dukes started to
heat up. First Tom Pipkins, who is WPIAL’s all-time leading
high school scorer. hit a three. Then Maryland transfer Nick
Bosnic buried another three from the baseline. After a Pitt score,
Bosnic nailed another trey to cut the Panthers’ lead to 41-39.

Dukes nip Lady Panthers

First loss in team

By Kevin Lilley
Staﬁ‘ Writer

 

The Pitt women’s basketball team lost
its third straight contest last night, drop-

55-53, at the Civic Arena

An early lead and tenacious defense
kept the Lady Panthers in control for most
of the contest, but a late rally by the Dukes
and a last-second layup gave the Panthers
 - their first-ever loss to Duquesne in 14

' contests.
Pitt opened the contest with a 12-5
 offensive run spearheaded by Latia
3 Howard, the sophomore center who
notched four points in the ﬁrst seven min-
utes. Duquesne called a time out to stop
the bleeding, and came back to within two
later in the half, led by guard Gail
.« ,.  Wﬂldns, who scored 14 of her team-high

"‘ 17 points in the ﬁrst, including two three-
pointers.

The teams traded baskets for the second
part of the ﬁrst period, but two late three-
pointers by Pitt’s LaTonya Durham and
Gina Montesano gave the Panthers a 32-
29 halftime lead

Montesano’s greatest contribution to the
squad in the first half, however, was keep
ing Duquesne All—American sophomore
Korie Hlede silent. Hlede managed only
 one bucket in the ﬁrst half and 12 for the

Pitt keeping its small advantage. Seven
minutes into the period, a Duquesne time

layups and tying the score at 50 apiece.
Montesano was fouled on the next posses-
sion, and made one of her two foul shots
to give the Panthers a slim edge.

Then, from the 5:32 mark to the 0:36
mark of the period, both offenses took a
holiday. Teams traded missed shots for
nearly ﬁve minutes, putting no points on
the board and pushing both squads’ ﬁeld
goal percentages below 40 percent.

Howard blamed the troubles on the
Dukes’ last-second teamwork.

“Duquesne came together better than
us.” she said.

Bruce summed up the contest by stat-
ing. simply. “They did what they had to do
to win the game. and we did not"

In those last seconds. Duquesne guard
Sherri Harman nailed a three-pointer to
give the Dukes a 53-51 lead. Stephanie
Petho tied the score with two late free
throws. and the arriving men's crowd
began settling in for overtime.

But with five ticks left. Trixie Wolf of
the lady Dukes banked in a layup. despite
being fouled on the attempt. She niissed
the foul shot. but Pitt's last-ditch effort at a
bucket ended with a Duquesne steal at

Tom Pipkins led all scorers last night with 27
points in the inaugural City Game.

Trio of Duquesne stars could have been Panthers

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

Three Western Pennsylvanian basketball studs who did
not choose to play at Pitt probably wished they did after
Pitt’s 84-73 outclassing of the Duquesne Dukes last night
at the Civic Arena.

The trio of stars — Tom Pipkins, Nick Bosnic and
Kevin Price — all lined up against the Panthers in the sea-
son opener for both teams.

Junior guard sensation Tom Pipkins, the WPIAL’s all-
time leading scorer with 2,838 points at Valley High
School, never really considered playing for the Panthers,
despite their efforts to woo him.

He didn't disappoint last night. Pipkins led all scorers
with 27 points, including an impressive 7 of 15 from
three-point range.

Laurel Highlands High School’s Bosnic is a sophomore
transfer from the University of Maryland. Bosnic report-
edly ﬂirted with playing with the Panthers, and judging by
his play last night, his presence would be welcome.

“Nick has the reputation of being a good player in these
parts,” ﬁrst year Duquesne head coach Scott Edgar said.

Bosnic gave Duquesne fans something besides Pipkins
to look forward to this season.

Bosnic and Pipkins keyed an early second-half run that

saw the Dukes pull within two at 41-39 with 15:32
remaining. The 9-2 Duquesne run was fueled by two
Bosnic three-pointers, and another by Pipkins.

But after that, Pitt shooting guard Garrick Thomas trig-
gered an 11-0 Pittrun with two three-pointers that gave
the Panthers the lead for good.

Bosnic finished the game with 22 points and 10
rebounds, including six on the offensive glass. Eight of
Bosnic’s points came on put-backs.

“Bosnic’s gonna be a good player,” Pipkins said. “I
think he’ll be a good player on the next level.”

The third Western Pennsylvanian stud down Forbes
Avenue is Price. The Duquesne High School grad had a
sporadic night, scoring 10 points, to round out Duke scor-
ers in double ﬁgures, and seven rebounds. Many of his
shots were easy put—backs, with the most spectacular com-
ing with 6:30 left in the game.

After Bosnic missed a lay—up, Price followed the miss
with a monster jam that had the Dukes side exploding
with glee. The dunk pulled Duquesne within 11 at 66-55,
and Price exerted some enthusiasm that the rest of his
team lacked the entire contest.

“Kevin is going to be a good player,” Edgar said. “He
and Bosnic still have three years left.”

What a sweet three years they might have been had they
chosen to be at Pitt

. The Lady Panther volleyball team, looking to
bounce back from a loss to Notre Dame in the
Big East Championship,_ dropped two out of
three matches at the Baden Blowout this past
weekend in San Diego.

“We came into this weekend knowing that we
had to knock off one or- two of these teams,”
freshman Annemarie Tarara said. “We were
just excited to be in the tournament.” .

Pitt came into the weekend with a 18-9 mark
and faced 20-9 Long Beach State University in
the first match Friday. The Panthers took LBSU
to the hilt in the first game, but eventually lost
18-16. ‘ "

Long Beach State took the next two games in
relatively quick fashion winning 15-5 and 15-8.
Tarara had 13 kills and a .400 hitting-percent-
age in the loss. Jennie Driscoll also added 13
kills for the Lady Panthers. ~

Brita Schwerm had a game-high 30 kills for
LBSU and hit .455. Jessica Alvarado notched
13 kills and hit .310, while Kristy Kierluff

added nine kills and a game-high .471 hitting
percentage. ,

The loss marked the first time since early
September that Pitt dropped two matches in a
row. The Panthers lost to Ball State and Pacific
back-to-back at the Ball State Classic.

Pitt bounced back to beat Rice (20-14)
Saturday in four games 17-15, 11-15, 15-9 and
15-11. Driscoll and Tarara once again led the
Pitt attack with 12 kills apiece. Sara Mikla
added 10 kills and hit .333.

The Panthers looked for their 20th win later
that night against Cal Santa Barbara, but they
lost three straight games to the Lady Gauchos
15-9, 15-3 and 15-6.

Tarara said, “We’re not playing well consis-
tently; if we could do that we’d be phenome-
nal.” .

Cal Santa Barbara raised its record to 25-8,
while the Panthers fell to 19-11.

The Panthers will play again Friday, as they
face Fresno State in the National Invitational
Volleyball Tournament. Pitt will then meet up
with Stephen F. Austin Saturday, with the

But Pitt responded. In less than a three—minute span. the
Panthers punched in 11 unanswered points.

After center Gerald Jordan split a pair of free throws. Jerry
McCullough went coast-to—coast, weaved through traffic and hit
a runner in the lane. After a Jordan layup, bookended by a pair
of Garrick Thomas three-pointers. Edgar was forced to call a
time out. 9

Up 52-39 with 12:38 remaining, the Panthers again had a
comfortable cushion.

“Coach always tells us it’s a game of runs,” said Varga. who
scored 12 points and snagged 10 rebounds. “That’s what it really
was tonight. We just have to play with poise. If they come at us
with a run, we just have to come back with a run of our own."

After Pitt’s big second-half run, the Dukes could never recov-
er, as they only once sliced the lead to single digits.

The Panthers’ offensive attack was balanced. Five players
scored double digits. Cummings, in his first official collegiate
game, led all Panthers with 18 points. He also grabbed eight
boards and had four‘ assists. McCullough notched 14 points and
five assists. Jordan and Alridge tallied 13 and 12, respectively.

“Obviously I’m glad the game is over,” Willard said of his
inexperienced team. “I told the kids before the game it was
going to be a little like the off-Broadway troop coming to
Broadway, meaning. we have eight guys who haven’t been under
the curtain.”

Yeah, Aiiightll Whattup kids? lm

I back after a self-induced hiatus.

Working hard for my December grad-
uation, time is of the essence. But
Blakk Steei’s gonna continue to bring
the flava on the real. Mad Props to
the Sigmas for employin’ a brotha to
deejay their party. Mad love to the
Deltas for employin’ the brotha for
their party on Dec. 8. Mad love to the
supporters and the dillz to the nonbe-
lievers, jealous and those trying to
forget where they came from; they
know exactly who they are. So sit
back and try to enjoy the summary of
my trip to Florida.

P.S. — next week, be on the look-
out for the Ten Best Albums list of
1995. It'll run in the DITC section of
The Vox, of course. ‘

Here we go:
Fnday

Upon arriving at Miami, and notic-
ing that the bastards from USAir stole
the strap off my bag, I gathered my
things and proceeded to what I
believed to be my hotel. When I got
there, my reservation was switched
without my knowing it. I was literally
homeless for about nine hours. I was
able to persuade the hotel to hold my

. luggage while I began to partake of

my all-expense-paid trip.

In the first half hour, I met Dana
Dane, The D.O.C., The Organized
Noize family (Outkast, Goodie Mob),
The Boot Camp Clik (Black Moon,
Smif-n-Wessun, Heltah Skeltah,
Originoo Gunn Clappuz), Busta
Rhymes, Doug E. Fresh, Vicious and

- many others before I got registered.

Once registered, I started attending
the seminars and showcases. The
only seminar I was able to catch was
the management panel. Basically,
they passed on a lot of rhetoric that
has been used and reused from con-
vention to convention; so I didn’t
learn anything new. The Demo Clinic
wasn’t as tight as I thought it would
be. The singers sounded a lot better
than the rappers. One thing about it
that was good was the fact that it was
held in'an open place for public
scrutiny and observation as well as
for industry heads. Whether or not
anyone gets picked up from there will
remain a mystery, because no one
showed up to the unsigned artists’
showcase.

Once I located my conference con-
tact and found my correct reserva-
tion,'| showered and made tracks to
the showcase that featured KRS
One, Channel Live, Fat Joe, Mad
Skillz, Boot Camp Clik, RBX and
many other new artists. When I got
in, Boot Camp was onstage repre-
sentin’ on the real. Buckshot pre-
miered 'a brand new Black Moon joint
that was tight. Mad Skillz stepped up
next and just started droppin’ A-
bombs on the crowd. To date, he is
one ofthe funkiest one-liners in the
game. As if he wasn’t- enough, he
had his crew with him, and they were
equally as good. (Word bond, these
kids should have a deal.) I’m heavily

anticipating this album. After that, the
show went drastically downhill. It just
became a bunch of noise that begins
to make it difficult to stay. After wad-
ing through the unknowns, Fat Joe
stepped up, performing all new mate-
rial. It wasn’t stellar, but it wasn’t bad
either. He looks to have a little some-
thin’ to show this time around. In
came Channel Live. After performing
“Reprogram,” I left because I knew
they wouldn’t perform “Mad ism” until
Kris hit the stage. I never saw KRS’
act.

Saturday

After sleeping through all the pan-
els on this day, I got up and began to
embark on the day's adventures. I
caught up to my Underground Hip

rod, my man from Priority, was able
to work out a discount for a free pass
to the West Side Connection concert
featuring Ice Cube, Mack 10, K-Dee,
WC and The Maad Circle and Dazzle
Dee. After going back to the hotel to
freshen up, it became a toss up
between the West Side show and
Luke’s Peep Show. Since Luke’s
eventwas going on all night, we
decided to hit that after the West Side
show.

Arriving at the concert,the deejay
that was spinning the party was on
point. He hit all the east coast joints
on the head; even album joints that

out for a while. We ran into Nas
Escobar, the whole Tribe Called
Quest, Pudgee, Tha Dogg Pound,
Rampage The Last Boy Scout, WC
and The Maad Circle and many
more; but since they already got
them on film, I moved on to the next
thing.

I hooked up with my record reps
from Priority & Mercury Records and
went to this restaurant that had a live
reggae band and exotic foods on the

‘ menu. Tightening my relationship

with my reps over good food was def-
initely the move, although I did miss
the buttah WEA beach party with
Mad Skillz, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Das
Efx, SuperNatural and many others.

  
  
    
 

 

can’t get away with playing at a party
here. It was lovely. During the party,
The D.O.C. and I exchanged num-
bers and I planted the bug in his ear
about the possible production for
him. He directed to his manager to
work out the details. The concert
finally got under way and it was
whack. I was upset that I actually
stayed for that. Coming to that real-
ization, when it was over (it ended at
12:30), it was time to go to the Luke
show.

Luke had shuttles that were taking
people to and from the party from the
main hotel. I jumped on one. Upon
arriving, I saw a line of people,
celebrities and others alike, wrapped
around the entire building almost

November 30 1995

   

twice. Celebrities couldn’t use their
faces to jump line or get in free. The
club was already packed wall-to-wall
on the inside, with not too much room
left. Seeing that, I never got off the
bus. I wasn’t the only one on that tip.
Doctor Dre of Yo! MTV Raps fame &
Hot 97, Easy Mo Bee, DJ Scribble
and others never left the bus with me.
With a $20 cover, and a two-hour
wait in the rain, those who were on
the bus remained there and returned
to the hotel. I spent the rest of the
night with my Sega Genesis.

Sunday

Since none ofthe panels or early
showcases were of any interest to

me, I watched the football games-

instead. After showering and getting
dressed, I hooked up with my rep
from Relativity Records and had a
phat-ass lasagna dinner at a quiet,
expensive Italian restaurant. There, I
met Above The Law and Kokane.
They didn’t stay long, but they put me
up on their upcoming projects. I can’t
say too much about them until I actu-
ally hear them. I did give them their
just dues on their past products that I
liked, and they moved on

After the meal, we went back to the
main hotel, where the Def Squad, Wu
Tang Clan and the rest of Def Jam’s
roster came in town and all eyes and
attention were on them. Method Man,

* Redman, Keith Murray and many oth-

ers did video drops for our video
show (Underground Hip Hop Video
Magazine) and actually remembered
some of the campaigns that we ran
(“Save That Shit!l” — stop the vio-
lence campaign). All the celebs start-
ed coming then; it was lovely.

The big event of the day was the
Def Jam 10th Anniversary Party/
Concert featuring Onyx, Tribe Called
Quest, Suga (a.k.a. Sweet Tee), Run
DMC, Kali Ranks, The Def Squad
and the Wu Tang Clan. The line was
mad long in high 80s heat at night.

After cutting the line up front, I got
into the joint where The Flip Squad
was representin’ to the fullest on the
Technics. Since they were New York
bigwigs in deejaying, they got away
with playing anything and everything:
I loved every minute of it. Of course,
they played the big hits like “Ice
Cream” and “Cell Therapy,” but they
played mad album cuts that would’ve
cleared the floor here that didn’t
there, which makes for a better party-
ing environment and less fights. I was
all love in that piece.

The concert began with Kali Ranks
dropping album cuts and the joint that
opened heads to him, “Kill Dem All.”
if his album sounds anything like the
three joints he performed, his album
is one to check for.

Next up was Suga. She came out
freestyiing with no real reception. Her
sidekick stated that the audience
acted like they didn't know who she
was. He was right; I didn’t even know
who she was. I didn’t know, until she
did the lyrics to ‘‘It’s My Beat” over

The Rebirth of Cool

if you missed Hollywood's
favorite Bowery boy on the Lame
Show with D. Letterman a few
weeks ago, you missed a very
bombed Sean Penn plugging his
new movie The Crossing Guard in

typical playboy style, tripping his

way through the interview and

playin’ Davey for the fool. Time
and time again Conan is provin’
himself to be the more diggable of
New Yawk Cit-AYYY’s boob-tube
hosts, but Letterman had a hot
one on his hands with Madonna’s
ex.
“So, I punched him in the head

and he didn’t move,” Sean’s latest

bar-brawl story begins before
Letterman moves him onto The
Crossing Guard. Penn is directing
this one, his second, with Jack
Nicholson and Anjelica Huston.
Penn seems real out-of-it, groggy
enough to have to focus on his
cigarette to pull through this public
appearance. Letterman asks

Penn if he hangs out with
Nicholson. “Oh yeah, we trip
around town.” So what’s he like,
Davey wants to know. “He’s kind
of abstract,” Penn says. “We were
at a bar, some girl came up to
him, and asked, ‘Hey Jack! Do
you wanna dance?"’ Penn cracks
a smile, “And Jack said, ‘Wrong
verb.”’ Most definitely out-hipped,
Dave gets all boyish and excited,
“Ooooh, that’s cool,” pretending
as if he’s writing that one down.
“That’s really, really cool,” Davey
goes on. And l’m with Dave, you
tell me how can I be down?

You gotta wonder if all Penn
had to do directing Nicholson was
throw up his hands and tell him,
“Jack, you’re just so cool. Just 
just  go out and do whatever. it
don’t matter, we’ll all think it's
cool.’’ Yeah, so there aren’t many
good movies playing around
Pittsburgh, but at least you can be
vicariously cool watching people
who are cooler than you in The
Crossing Guard. (The Rex
Theater, Southside. Fri-Thurs:
7:30, 9:45. Sat & Sun: 2‘and 4:15)

Or you could go see people who
are not as cool as you are in
Persuasion and feel x times more
cool after The Crossing Guard

ed). Robert Miche||’s adaptation of
Jane Austen’s Victorian piece

Notes from The Pitt
News Editor-in-Chief
Who Thinks He's Bad

Enough To Write For
The Vox

Cluas von Bulow, the epitome of
rags to riches, learned real quickly
how to act when you’re accused
of attempting to murder your wife.
He said he loved her, said he was
innocent, said he was framed.
said he was not capable of such a

heinous crime, said he would
devote his life to finding the guilty
people. A

Hmmm. Sounds pretty familiar.

Then, in a very OJesque fash-
ion, he went out and hired get-
you-off-guru Alan Dershowitz to
represent him. Dershowitz, who
was a member of Simpson's
dream team and also defended
Mike Tyson for rape, wrote a book
about the Claus-Sunny von Bulow
case, and Barbet Schroeder made
it a flick called Reversal of
Fortune. Ron Silver does an
admirable job as the workaholic
defense lawyer Dershowitz, and
Jeremy Irons plays the grief-
stricken, misunderstood Von
Bulow. /t’s p/ayinggsaturday. 8

Saturday Night Fever used to

' mean white polyester suits, partner

of the Bee Gees, but if you're in
Pittsburgh circa this upcoming week-
end, expect to catch a completely dif-

Comedown: A Flava Forum” will be
an all-night breakbeatfest featuring a

' lineup of local and national DJs
 whose hip—hop, dancehall and jungle

right offyour dancing booty.

The brainchild of former Telecorps’
member Ed Bucholtz and ambitious
DJs-from WPTS and WRCT, the

a form of breakbeat created in 1991
by London DJs, remains quite popu-

“Comedown” spinners prefer the
more complex breakbeats of intelli-

Duck ‘n Cover
Various
Blue Duck Records

Using a title reminiscent of
the Cold War scare of the
19503, Blue Duck Records
introduces new voices to some
familiar tunes in an 18-track
CD released last night. The
bands featured in these newly
released tracks are local
favorites along with some
neighboring acts. The compila-
tion brings the ‘90s sound in
with some innovative'varia-
ﬂons. .

The dreamy rendition of ‘The
Word,’_’ originally performed by
The Beatles and reworked by
Elektra Loves Daddy, has got
a relaxing feel to it in contrast
to The Clarks’ distinctive ver-
sion of “Dear Prudence,” also
originally performed The
Beatles. The acoustical bril-
liance of Mark Eddie joins the
group with “| Don’t Like
Mondays" from the Boomtown
Rats.

The diverse talent and musi-
cal perspective that each-artist
has to offer comes through in
songs like “White Rabbit” —
jammed up by Kama Sutra,
originally by Jefferson
Airplane. The Means may not
be around any more, but their

performance of the Violent‘

Femmes classic, “Blister in the
Sun” will have a long shelf life.
The song is heavy with flashy
guitar riffs and upbeat lyrics
worthy of any frat party looking

' to liven things up.

The 11th Hour was at the
CD release party last night
rockin’ the house with their
loud version of “True,” which

' comes from a fairly unknown

band from Georgia called The
Fans. Pittsburgh’s Nixon
Clocks were also present sup-
porting their well-crafted take
on “Coming Up Close” from
the band Til Tuesday. The CD
closes with The Dick Clarks’
soulful message of self-respect
coming through Des’ree’s “You
Gotta Be.”

Blue Duck Records is com-
ing out with another release
featuring their bold new band
Slackjaw, which will have a
party tonight at Cloud 9 to
introduce their Cleveland-
based sound to the Steel City.
The best local label in town is
definitely doing its job keeping
Pitt up with innovative sound.
National Record Marts will
carry all its CDs by December.

Bare Minimum

Night We Streak b/w
Winterstrait Brand,
SubPop

Some records are instantly
recognizable as belonging to a
certain class of music. Pop in,
say, a Jesus and Mary Chain
album, and you think “This
came from England.” Or try
any of the bands riding the
Berkeley punk wave — you'll
think California. Slip on some
Bare Minimum, and your mind
will be all over the world’s
map. Mixing English, DC,
punk, pop and rock elements,
they create a sound that is
somehow uniquely their own.

The A side jumps off with
“Night We Streak, Divine
Failure," a song that at first
evokes the wall of fuzz com-
mon to the UK sound. The

  

vocals are precisely and calm-
ly delivered o_ver a minor-
tinged, sometimes dissonant
background, creating a dark,
overall soundscape. Then the
refrain hits, and the band
evokes a post-punk texture
with louder vocals, fully voiced
distorted chords and an overall
essence that reminds me a lit-
tle bit of Fugazi. The sonic tour
continues as the band hits a
stop action bridge, throws in

some riffs with dissonance,.

and returns to the verse.
Overall, it’s a well-crafted
song. .
“Winterstrait Brand” contin-
ues the sonic blending of
“Night We Streak” in a more
relaxed vein. The guitars fea-
ture a nice warbly tone and in-
the-pocket playing. Likewise,
the drums and bass lay back
and play subtly. Dynamics are
nice, saving the song from the
sometimes-monotonous verse.
The refrain, which echoes the
thrust of “Night We Streak,”
provides a punchy interlude
and further demonstrates the
band’s ability to mix numerous
styles in one song.

But Bare Minimum is not a
musical fruit cup in which dis-
tinct song segments, like
chunks of peach and melon,
represent the fruits of various
musical ideas. The sound is

Faucet
Southern Records

Faucet demonstrates just
how possible it is for one band
to be all things to all listeners.
Weelll  all things to all fans of
aggressive rock, at least. But
anyone who enjoys hard riff-
rock songcraft should find
something to like here, too. In
fact, their approach to music
means that you could even
find everything you like in one
song. ,

Underlined by a constantly
tight, driving and insistent
rhythm section, the band takes
you on a whirlwind musical
tour, ignoring conventional
rules of song structure.
Faucet’s riff-laden style switch-
es up the groove so often, you
sometimes find yourself on the
musical equivalent of that
madcap, lost-in-the-city car
ride, swerving at high speeds
through different sonic neigh-

7

borhoods, none of which seem
friendly. _

The album begins with the
hypnotic, repetitive and slow
“Marnie,” which features a nice
evolution of the melody and an
interesting skipped-beat sec-
tion that wakes you up from
your slumber in the back seat.
“Attenuate Numerical” takes
you for a cruise through that
angry, seedy, lo-fi part of town.
“Daddy-o”’s verse evokes
Helmet’s precise working-class
wall-of-sound, while “Song _In
Progress” embodies the pop
suburbs gone ugly, with growl-
ing guitars and stuttering
drums transforming. an other-
wise trite melody into a new
phenomenon. But the track
entitled simply  manages to
work all these sounds into the
mix.

 starts off slow, with plenty
of treble, melody and a bass
line that evokes Shellac’s
“Wingwalker.” Later, the song
takes an exit to a stop-action
groove that quickly turns intoa
potholed, bone-crushing grind-
fest slowing gradually until a
wall of treble fuzz picks the
tempo and melody back up

Do you want to hear in great
detail about my personal prob-
lems and how sad I am?

I Apparently a lot of zine writers

think you ‘do.

Recently Unspoken Words

I Wish I Could Speak (to you)

#7 turned up in my mailbox. I

am really simplifying this whole

thing, but the editor seems

really angryand upset. Don't

get me wrong, there’s a lot of

things in this world to be angry

and upset about, and she

chooses worthwhile targets

(like alcohol and boys who pre-

tend to be “feminists”), but you

can communicate more effec-
tively when you’re not pos-

sessed by anger. Now, I can

see a lot of emotion in the

author, which is great,

because a lot of times it is diffi-

cult to convey strong emotion
through the written word. She
also frames what she’s ranting
about with really personal
anecdotes, which give us a
sense of the kind of person
that she is, and what it would
be like to know her.

The problem is, once people
know that you’re upset, the
most effective thing to do is to
rationally analyze the situation
and come up with a possible
solution. The author didn't
place a whole lot of emphasis
on the last two parts of this
equation. One area that this
zine does better than most is
in the graphics department.
There are a lot of images that
look like they may have been
computer-manipulated, and
they really stand out from the

I referred to the author as
“she,” and that’s not a female
name up there, but that’s not
the author, OK?

In contrast, the author of
Stifled talks a lot about the
same kind of issues that UWl-
WICS does, but they’re'talked
about in a more concrete con-
text and more rationally
thought out. There was a piece
on why it’s important for
women to masturbate that I
enjoyed quite a bit. Basically, it
said that masturbation is a way
for women to attain sexual
pleasure without being depen-
dent on anyone, but there’s a
lot more to it than that. There
are also rants on non-violence
and patriotism that are similar-
Iy wel|—reasoned. One of the
things that separates this from
a lot of zines of the whining-
about-my-life genre is the addi-
tion of stuff like handwriting
analysis and what it means to
be born under the sign of
Gemini. In case you can’t tell, I
think this is definitely one of
the best zines of this ilk that
l’ve read in a long time. It's
available from: Jocelyn

into a faster reprise of earlier
themes. Faucet finishes it off
with hard riffs and sustained
chords, each suggesting the
end of the assault but refusing
to let the song die so easily. It
truly is a masterwork of com-
position, blending different and
dissonant styles skilfully. The
end result is not a retread of
any style, but a completely
new fusion of ideas into a
unique style that hits you in a
new way every 30 seconds.

The same thing can be said
about the whole album. It only
proves that sometimes, throw-
ing the map away results in
the best trip.

Hey, you!!! Remember me
from last semester's
Interstellar Dance Mix,
Monday nights from 11 p.m. to
1 a.m. on WPTS? You
don’t??? Oh, well, then you
shouldn’t be reading this arti-
cle, because you’ll have no
idea as to what I’m tawlkin’
about. Those of you who
remember are already inti-
mately acquainted with FSOL
—— in fact, your pupils are prob-
ably still dilated from their
Lifeforms debut and the awe-
some artwork on the album
sleeve. FSOL _are a preco-
cious party of sonic trance
geniuses who don’t give a
damn about the dance charts.

November 30 1995

 

Its time to give credit where it’s
not usually given.

It all started with 15 bucks
and a mediocre record store in
Oakland. I got a hold of
Lifeforms at around the same
time that I had discovered the
mind—emptying, mondo mirac-
ulous World 0’ Trance. Being
the explorer that I am, I geared
up with traxx mix, caffeine pills
and oversized Osh Kosh
b’Gosh to embark upon a
transworld journey through
space and sound, hoping that
I'd make it back before my
Existentialism class. I finally
landed in the world of
Lifeforms with fear and trem-
bling because I had never
expected nor experienced the
qwarksy, unstructured reso-
nance that I was seeing as
well as.hearing.

First of all, FSOL rebelliously
lacks repetition. This is a no-
no for electronic trance
because the repetition is vital
in maintaining a hypnotic state.
FSOL wouldn't agree.
Lifeforms is ‘pure, atmospheric
spontaneity, and it doesn’t
promise a bass line either. It
breaks all of the conventions
of trance and accurately rede-
fines it. It entrances you, con-

fuses you and leaves the-

money on the table. The only
indication I had of what to
expect from this album was
the song titles.
“Omnipresence,” for example,
has an elevating and expand-
ing sound which promises to
put you everywhere at once.
“Cerebral" belts out swaying
Joe Cool static jingles which

home-spa for the intellect. And
you can dance to it, too!

Just when l thought it was
safe to trek further into the
sonic stellar'realms, l’m
stopped dead in my traxx with
FSOL’s “Far Out Son of a Lung
and the Ramblings of a
Madman” EP, which was
released last summer as a
warning for their new album
/SDN. I don’t recommend dri-
ving for up to 24 hours after lis-
tening to this album. it starts off
with a wonderfully slavish and
sloppy saxxy intro with rever-
berated sighs of relief seguing
intoeach song. The album is
phenomenal! “Smokin’
Japanese Babe” should be
danced to in a dark, dark room.
This song has more curves
than Anna Nicole Smith. It
highlights with slow sensual
sirens drawing you in by the
seat of your pants and the
sway of your, hips. “An
Experiment With Six Guitars”
promises just that — all that it
requires is that you remain
standing. “Snake Hips”. doesn’t
even belong here! I don’t know
how it slipped by the immortals,
but we are definitely not worthy
of its bubbling 24kt gold sam-
pling and deceptive lift-off
effects.

l’m not going to tell you what
ISDN stands for — you’ll figure
it out after you listen. But I can
tell you with complete confi-
dence that listening to it is
analogous to jumping off a cliff
and thinking “up” instead of
down.

ence acted like they didnt
know who she was. He was
right; I didn’t even know who
she was. I didn’t know, until
she did the lyrics to “|t’s My
Beat” over Faith’s “You Used
To Love Me.” That was the '
true bomb. Heads was flip-
pin’. She performed “What’s
Up Star?” and broke out.

Tribe Called Quest came to
the plate with mad flava. Of
course, they did their classic
joints, but performed some
brand joints as well. They
didn’t say the names of the
songs, but needless to say,
their shit will be highly antici-
pated for the nine-sex. Q-Tip
almost got into a fight with a
kid in the audience, because
the kid tried to push him fur-
ther into the crowd, out of
reach of security. It was
peace after a while. Nothing
came of it.

Erick Sermon stepped up
doing pieces of classic EPMD
songs. He was about to go
into “Hostile” with Keith
Murray, when the sound kept
messing up. Instead of con-
tinuing for the sake of per-
forming, he left, never to
return. So his act was cut
short.

Onyx burst on the scene
like madmen. Their presence
was felt from the beginning
note. Those that wouldn't
slamdance moved to the
back while the rugged and
raw stayed for the banging
section. Throwing water in
the audience, and also diving
into the crowd, Onyx kept the
crowd captive from beginning
to end. Performing all of their
classic hits (“Throw Ya
Gunz,” “Shifftee,” “Da Nex
Niguz,” “Slam”), as well as
their new joints (“Last Days,”
“all We Got lz Us,” “Walk In
New York”), their show was
well-versed.
