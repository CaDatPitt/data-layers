The Pittsburgh Student Government
Council elected Pitt’s graduate stu-
dent government and its current
president Nila Devanath to lead the
group during the Spring 2011 term
as it continues to push .for student
civic engagement and representa-
tion. U ' ‘ '
Devanath replaced former chair

James Regar, of Duquesne Universi— A
ty, and will hold the position for one; V

academic semester. Her duties 
include coordinating regular council
meetings, organizing meetings with

City Council and serving as the of-

ﬁcial spokeswoman for PSGC.

“It’s a big honor to have been
chosen for this position,” Devanath

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Pitt athletic
director Steve Pederson broke his
silence Thursday and spoke with se-
lected members of the media through

Petersen Events Center. He addressed
a number of issues surrounding the

One thing he clariﬁed was the

Bed bugs discovered in Sutherland Hall

University inspections revealed more than 28 rooms in Sutherland Ha_ll had signs of bed bilgs, Pitt eradicated all insects

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Pitt found a minor bed bug problem in two
dormitories at the University last week
and has cleaned the affected rooms.

Initially, Pitt had reports of three rooms
with bedbugs at Pitt: two in Sutherland
Hall East and one in Lothrop Hall, Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said. He said that
the number of bugs was minimal but did
not provide a speciﬁc ﬁgure.

Fedele said that a part of Sutherland
Ha1l’s first ﬂoor was shut down for clean-

— ing on Thursday, after a bed bug was found

on a chair in Pitt police’s substation.
The University inspected Sutherland

-Hall East and found an additional 28

rooms with signs of the bugs, although
none were visible. All of the rooms with

bugs have since been cleaned, and Fedele '

said that Pitt will continue precautionary

treatment; ' 4
Signs of the bugs include exoskeletons

in the bed or the bugs themselves in'folds

of the bedding. An infested area might also
have a musty smell to it, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion website. Guillermo Cole, spokesman
for the Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment, said that his office has received an
increasing number of calls about bed bugs
in recent years. V

He said that while it is possible to han-
dle the bugs in a single unit residential
setting, it’s far more difficult to treat them

. in an apartment building or dormitory. '

“Then, it is time to bring in the profes-

sionals,” he said. _
According to the CDC’s website, bed
bugs are parasitic insects that feed on hu-

' mans and animals while they sleep. They

are between one and seven millimeters
long,,ﬂat and cannot fly.

The website said the insects are an in-
convenience but do not carry diseases.

No one in other residence halls had
reported problems with bed bugs, and
Fedele "encouraged students to report
suspected bed bugs quickly so that the
University can deal with them. I

EDITORIAL

We adviseyou don’t read this if you have a foot fetish

and sheepskinbootknock-
‘ l offs are a tired-, tired fashion
trend. They make up a third

of the uniform of average college girls

i — particularly those in sororities —

that consists of the wooly atrocities

alongwith leggings and ablack North

Face j acket. Hot or not, we’d all like to

see some more variety in the form of
fashion on campus.

If dressing. more originally and
creatively is not in your immediate
interest, one podiatrist is claimingthat
Uggs and similarboots might increase

“ your risk of foot fungus.

_ Accordingto an article in Fashioni-
sta, Dr. Olivier Zong, the director of
surgery atNYC Footcare, said, “Fungus
breeds in dark, wet environments —
conditions thatareusually seen inside

trendy sheepskin boo .” -
So before you take that boot—wear-
er home with you, you might want to
check out his or her foot situation.
In addition, this might be a good
reason to leave your socks on during
sex, an act that is considered by some

to be a sexual faux pas — aka some 4

individuals with foot fetishes.
But it is important to note that

some podiatrists disagree that Uggs
in particular cause foot ﬁmgus.

Dr. Howard Shapiro with Manhat-
tan Podiatry said, “Footﬁingus likes a
dark moist environment, so any sock
and shoe could provide that, especially
during the winter. Uggs have a wool
liningsoifanythinglwouldthinkthat

‘ they would absorb the sweat.” ,

_ Pairing those boots with your

denim  inthe summer, how-
ever, not only looks awkward but likely
causes more foot sweat.

Whether or not you thinkUggs and
their knockoffs are fashionable, it is
not advisableto wear the same shoes
every day, according to Fashionista,
because shoes need about-24 hours

A MIDWESTERN PIECE ,

  Augmented reality takes high tech

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Finding out somebody’s age is often a
good deal of fun, because it is irnpoli—
tic to ask outright. Yet people can usu-
ally be induced to date themselves.
My mom, for one, ﬁnds out the age

~ of the IT guys atwork by sneaking up .

behind them and yelling, “The card

‘’ reader’s down!” and noting their re-

action. Now, we young farts might
consider ourselves above this game of
age betrayal. Afcerall,‘ we have experi-
ence with all the latest technology. We
V don’t have much age to betray. Yet we
deﬁnitely date ourselves. We can tell
you about zip and ﬂoppy disks, and
can reproduce the sound a dial—up
modem makes. Today’s average high-
school freshman can’t.
One way I date myselfis by think-
ing of the Internet as a static resource,

, to be used on a desktop computer

plugged into a wall someplace. Yet,
as today’s smartphones demonstrate,
this is no longer the case. The Internet

is remotely accessible, and will soon
become so in surprising ways.

An article in the Sept. 2010 Na-
tional Geographic Magazine dis-
cussed the concept 0 “augmented
reality,” or AR. It is now possible to
wear a pair of glasses that project an
image of the outside world before our
eyes. The glasses then superimpose
information gleaned from the Inter-
net aboutwhatwe are looking at, such
as an arrow toward the nearest gas
station, where a constellation will
risein the sky later or a review of the
restaurantwe are busy looking at. The
ﬁrst glasses retail at $600.

The glasses might exacerbate

N some very real problems we are start-

ing to have with higher technology.

‘ We all have friends who don’t know

how to read a map because they just
follow their GPS everywhere. What
happens when the battery runs out?
These friends are stuck. What hap-
pens when the GPS is wrong? Then we
hear stories about people driving off
cliffs. It is important to be able to read
W maps, or be able to navigate using a

sextant and chronometer at sea. The

higher technology makes such skills.
seem almosturmecessary, whichthey‘

are — until they’re really needed.
AR might lead to many losing
their grips on actual reality. Need to

ﬁndarestaurant?Used‘to be thatyou V

either asked somebody or looked in
likely places, suchas around universi-
ties and hotels. Is it safe to  down
a particular street? Without instant
crime statistics, one has to pay atten-

. tion to atmospheric cues. With AR,

it is tempting to let thecomputer be
situationally aware for you, andtune
‘out. By feeding people information,
AR systems might make them less
aware.

Too much information is bad for
other reasons.,Ifyou are focusing on
a. task‘ that requires ‘acquisition and

processing of information — driv— '

ing, for instance — it‘ is not helpful to
see that Tony’s Bar onthe corner is
warm, cozy and reasonably priced.
The distraction that results ﬁ'om the
irresponsible use oftheseARsystems
would pose a threat to public safety.

It would not be surprising if some
municipalities were to -ban the use

‘p of AR glasses while  A

Personal safety could also b
threatened by such devices. The un-
ages you see in the glasses are not the
realworldwith things superimposed
on them, but rather a virtual repro-
duction of the world. This virtual im-
age has to be governed by something,
and that something is a computer.
We’re all aware that computers are
fallible devices: They can run slug-
gishly or crash. A sluggish computer
attached to these glasses could be di-

. sastroiis as the user would see the

world with alag. The lag might not
be noticed until it was too late.
Other risks come with the very
thing needed to make AR happen:
a connection to the Internet. This
means the glasses canbe hacked into
and controlled remotely. Whafs to say
that in a few years AR can be turned
into virtual realityinaninstant, with-
out you ever knowingthat something
was wrong? Less Hollywood—like and
more mundane is the problem that

to a new level

a hacked AR system lets the hacker
see the world through your eyes, so
to speak. And what do we see every
day? Personal identiﬁcation num-
bers, combinations, passwords, what
websites we view and what stores we
frequent—valuable information in-
deed.

This is not to say we should bring
out the pitchforks and destroy the

technology immediately. AR is a"
' really neat concept. It would make

life much easier. It could also help
the disabled and elderly: So long,
bifocals! The deaf could be helped
by projecting text of a conversation
on the glasses, enabling them to
“hear.” Take this one step ﬁirther, to
a translation app, and the language
barrier is reduced. Imagine, real life
in aforeign countrywith subtitles! All
practical considerations aside, AR is
just cool. It’s almost science ﬁction.
But we should be aware of the very
real drawbacks to the technology, and
act accordingly. i

Evidence that racism isn't” a thingof the past

Chris Neverman
Contributing Editor

Over winter recess in Central Pennsylvania I

I attended a Festivus Party, one celebrating the

secular winter holiday popularized by a 1997
“Seinfeld” episode. At one point in the night I
was standing among ﬁve or six rr1iddle—aged
men when thetopic of Kanye West came up.

“Dick,” “jackass” and “idiot” were the three
adjectives thrown around before I asked if I
heard old men talking about something they
knew they didn’t understand. These men surely
had no clue that Kanye had just dropped argu-
ably the best album of the year, My Becmtzful
Dark: T1zIz'rterl Fazrtagjr. Thus they had to have
been talking about his much—publicized an-
tics, and even then, they were still probably’
out of touch.

l The conversation continued as I asserted
that Kanye was correct when he said, “George
Bush doesn’t care about black people.” As could
be expected, every type of insult imaginable
was hurled my way —— all because a few" old
men refuse to accept our country for what it
is — racist.

Kanye might as well have said, “White peo-
ple don’t care about black people,” because it’s
just as true. a ' -

People just don’t care. Theywould much
rather live in their little bubble — pretending
that it didn’t take three days to get substantial

aid to people in New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina and that even when aid arrived, it was
insufﬁcient, inadequate and misappropriated.
They would like to pretend that there isn’t an-
other side to the “American Dream” in which
more than4o million people, black and white,
live beneath the poverty line, while billion-
aires run around the country manipulating the
government, pressing to ensure that the gap

. between rich and poor continues to grow and

the middle class continues to stagnate.

To see this type of racism you needn’t look
past our very own city of Pittsburgh, a beautiful
place indeed but full of neighborhoods lacking
in racial diversity. Take Penn Avenue, one of the
longest streets in the city, and without a doubt
one of thépmost polarizing. It splits Garﬁeld
and Friendship and ﬁirther, Homewood and
Point__Breeze. According to the most recent
Census data, Point Breeze is 83.8 percent white
whereas Homewood is 98.3 percent black. Gar-

‘ ﬁeld is 72.4 percent black whereas Friendship

is 59.6 percent white. Can you think of a starker
contrast between neighborhoods? I can’t.
Have you ever been to a bar or club with a
“dress code” that includes “no baggy clothes,
sneakers or ﬁtteds”? If the answer is yes, you’ve
witnessed the fruits of institutionalized rac-
ism. john Teleha — manager of Bar Room,
SteelHouse and Saddle Ridge in Station Square
— recently commented onthe dress code to
City Paper saying, “You want to have a certain

image in there. You want everybody to look nice ‘

 have a good time, but don’t look like aburn.”
This is a prudent position to take when dealing

with something as sensitive as race, but it seems .

that the dress codes of these establishments
speciﬁcally target fashion popular with the
young urban constituency —— one that is still
perceived as dangerous and undesirable.
The story of Jordan Miles, a black high
school honors student from Homewood, il-
lustrates this point poignantly. Last January,

' three plain-clothes officers jumped from an

unmarked vehicle and confronted him while he
was walking to his grandmother’s house — the
confrontation ended with Miles being severely
beaten. According to an interview between
Miles and the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette, the of-
ﬁcers, who allegedly failed to identify them-
selves asvsuch, approached him and shouted,
“Where’s the money? Where’s the gun? Where’s
the drugs?” If those questions don’t scream ra-
cial proﬁlingl don’t knowwhat does. It seems as
if we live in a city where many assume that every
young, black man is a blemish on society.
We’ve all heard of crack, what it did to the
inner cities and how it changed the “game”
forever, but how many people know about
how it changed the demographics of America’s
jails? The factis since a1986 law, the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act, went into effect, the sentencing for
distributing one gram-of crack cocaine is just
as severe-as distributing 100 grams of powder
— an arbitrary, 1o0—to—1 disparity. As simple

- possession of crack now carries mandatory

The University at Pittsburgh seeks srnnkers aged 18-65

in a 9-week research study an the slznrt-teem attests at

has quadrupled, according to a study by the
Justice Policy Institute.. So is it surprising that,
according to The New York Times, in 2006 82
percent of those sentenced under federal crack
cocaine laws were black?

What’s even less surprising is the ease with
which white men in powerful positions, -like
those in Congress, can enact changes that are
aimed at continually ravaging the poor black
population in America. When you look at politi-

Alternative gyms go beyond treadmill

There are numerous gyms in the Pittsburgh area that offer workouts which are different from the usual exercise fare

» Merritt Wuchina
Staﬁ’ Writer

We’Ve come to that crucial point
in the year, a week after the holi-
day gorging and just months be-
fore swimsuit—clad spring breaks.
For some, that means it’s slender-
izing time. _
“Research shows that weight
gain after the holidays occurs,”
said Pitt Health and Physical
Activity professor Susan Gillis
Kruman. “Students should get
themselves into an activity that
is fun to do and do it consistently.
Exercising at least three times
a week for an hour is recom-
rnen‘ded.’’. '
So if you dread hitting the gym
or get bored while running mind-
lessly on a treadmill, there are
other options more suited to an
adventurous workout appetite’.
Throughout Pittsburgh and in the
surrounding areas are numerous‘

alternative gyms.

Many -students find them-
selves dancing on ‘weekend nights

at parties or club‘s,but few realize
that dance’ can also be an acces-

sible form of exercise.

At Pittsburgh Heat Hip—Hop
Dance Co., dancers of all ages
and skill levels brush up on their
moves while also getting an aero-
bic workout.

“Hip—hop makes your heart
beat faster and will strengthen
andcondition your cardiac mus-
cles. It will certainly make you
burn calories,” Kruman said. “If
you are burning off more than
taking in, you are going to lose
weight.” . '

_ Hip—hop dance started out as
a nonviolent way for rival gangs
to “battle” for territory, but in re-
cent years has developed a more
negative connotation within

' mainstream culture said Heat’s

owner Brenna Jaworski.

jaworski wants to shake that
‘notion and feels hip-‘hop is a
positive form of expression. She
plays songs from hip-hop artists
that newcomers might not have
heard before. ' i

“A lot of what is on the radio

is commercial rap, but hip-hop is

more positive,” she said. “We try

to show people the other side.”

All classes are wa_lk—ins and
run approximately one hour.

Every week, new moves are
taught step-by-step andare re-
peated in short combinations,
so that newcomers can catch on
quickly.

“Hip—hop is so explosive, you
get a good workout in an hour,”
Jaworski said. ’ '

The studio offers breakdanc-
ing classes, private lessons and
the opportunity to join its com-
petitive team. ’ V

“I’ve seen people come with
no experience and two years later
be semi—professional,” she said.

Unlike other forms of dance,

such as ballet, there is no ideal

body type or skill level for a hip-
hop dancer, jaworski said.

“A person who is trying to lose
weight will be able to groove and
get a vibe that will motivate them
to work harder,” she said. “Our

instructors are very inspiring and i

do not judge.”

The start of spring semester sig-

ration of travel plans for spring
break, marks the countdown to

summer vacation and provides‘

a chance to repair the damage

W done to our.GPAs during the fall

Above all, the beginning of the
spring semester in Pittsburgh is
taintedby unbearable amounts
of snow, rain, blizzards, tundras,
monsoons, tsunamisand Zeus’

wrath. Yes, the weather makes

..it difficult to walk to class drive

and do anything outside, but the
most unfortunate side effect of
this weather is the cramp it puts

_in our style.

Cold weather can seem impos-
sible to dress for, especially for
women who might lament the loss
of warmer weather garments like
skirts. In the summer, picking out

your daily garb seems almost ef- _
fortless, On the contrary, during

the winter months, dressing to go

Coats

Bundling up is no excuse for
dressing like a_ slob. There are
plenty of options for coats and

like down feathers and covers you
from head to toe. Many styles are
also waterproof, so they ensure
you stay warm while keeping you

and your outfit dry. If you don’t
want to be compared with the
Michelin Man, a subtler alterna-
tive is a puffer vest. It’s versatile.
because you can layer it over a
heavy sweater or ﬂeece coat.
Peacoats are great if you want
to dress up your winter ensem-
bles. They instantly add class
and a ﬁnished look to an outfit.

They’re also a great alternative"

if you’re looking for something
a little more dressy and clean

Yet another gym changing perceptions
about certain styles of dance is Fitness
With A Twist. 1

It’s an all—female studio, but unlike oth-
er gyms, students don’t don ratty sweat
pants: They strap on high heels and slip
into a pair of booty—shorts for their weekly
workout.

Then, they learn pole dancing along
with other sensual styles, like belly danc-

Seskey :

mg.-

The studio is run by women and in-
structors who strive to use what instructor
Ebony Seskey calls “absolutely not your
traditional form of exercise” to build self-
conﬁdence in students.

“Our favorite saying is ‘dance like no

. one is watching.’ It relaxes everything,”

Seskey said.

She recommends newcomers come to
the beginner classes or half—off college
night drop—in- sessions on Thursdays at 7
p.m. for $10 with a college ID.

“Understanding their_own body is the
hardest part for new students” she said.
“By the end of class they get to freestyle
and show off their new moves.”

And in addition to showing off new
moves, thesewomen often show off the
new muscles the workout helps to build.

“It.is a low impact workout that cannot
compare to anything else. Sounds funny,
but the muscle you build is amazing,” Ses-
key said.

Kruman noted that building muscle is

essential to overall ﬁtness and that the -

scale is not always a direct reflection of

“Muscle weighs more than fat and helps
you burn more calories,” she said. 1 “It
might not seem like you’re losing weight,
but if your clothes are ﬁtting better and
you arelooking better, you probably are
burning fat.”

Ashleigh Powell, a student at Fitness

With A Twist, found pole dancing to be an
excellent way to lose weight, but notes that
eating right is necessary as well.

“Along with the classes I kept a diet ‘

journal,” she said. “Making changes in
diet to suit your exercise routines makes a
huge difference. It’s not just in being able
to stay fit, but it also helps mental health
and well-being.”

Luck’s decision to stay    

in school refreshing

. Isaac Saul
. Staff Writer

Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck was 10
minutes of paperwork away from millions
of dollars in contract money and endorse-
ments. He Was eight months away from be_ing
a household name and the face of one lucky
NFL franchise; '

But withall that on the table,’ Luck_said
“No thanks.” ~~ my ' ‘ .

But why? In this day and age, it’s incred-
ibly rare to see such a young athlete turn down
the opportunity to  multi-million dollar
contract. In fact, most people are trying to
get those contractseven earlier. I S ,

Take the NBA for example, whose player
union is advocating for high school all-stars

to be draft eligible without having to complete _

a clay, let alone a year, of college.

out season in the NFL. Maybe Luck believes
the NFL won’t be in action next year or the
possibility is frightening enough that he de-
cided to play it safe. Either way, if the NFL
isn’t playing and Luck goes on to have another
outstanding season, win the Heisman, ﬁnd
a home that isn’t Carolina and turns into a
winner, -maybe we’ll all call him a genius.
But still, passingup the opportunity of a
lifetime is a huge risk. On top of the obvious
threat of injury, Stanford doesn’t even know
who its coach will ‘be next year after former
coachlim Harbaugh took the head coaching
job with the San Francisco‘49ers. e .
Interestingly, the day that one college

'all—star decides to stay put, another former

star college quarterback is headed into the
market. A  . .  ‘

‘ Vince Young, the Titans quarterback and
former national champion at the University
of Texas, is officially going to be cut or traded

Theidea of Luck returnin is

frightening for t

country.   F

Luck, who was virtually everyone’s No. 1
draft pick on the board and was set to head
to the Carolina Panthers with the ﬁrst overall

I pick in April’s draft, might have made a‘smart .

decision. _
First of all, who wants to "play for thePan—

._ thers? Carolina, whowon a whopping two

games this season, is in the midst of a coach-

p ing staff overhaul and in-a transition period

from mediocre to atrocious. _
With an old receiving corps starring a

. gimpy Steve Smith who hasn’t been a big-

time threat for a few years now, Luck would
hardly be the ﬁnal piece of the puzzle.
He knows, just as the Panthers likely do,

that he’ll probably have more fun playing

atstanford this year. Luck has two years of

eligibility remaining, but he is set to graduate A

next spring. _
“I am committed to earning my degree in
architectural design from StanfordUniversit_y
and am on track to accomplish this at the
completion of the spring’ quarter of 2012,”

Luck said in a‘ statement issued through the

school.

After a season where he set school re-
cords for touchdowns with 32 and completion
percentage of 70.7 percent, the idea of Luck
returning is frightening for the rest of the
country. After ﬁnishing second in the Heis-
man ballots to Auburn quarterback Cam New-
ton this ‘year, Luck will be the top choice for
Heisman if he gives a repeat performance.

Additionally, there is the threat of a lock-

he rest o the

' by the Titans, the team announced Thursday. _

Titans owner Bud Adams released a statement
Thursday concerning Young’s departure.
“Today, I informed our general manager
Mike Reinfeldt to move forward with plans to
begin the process of identifying the next quar-
terback for our franchise,” Adams said. “He
will inform Vince Young’s agent that _Vince

i will not be on our roster next season.”

Young, whose career is at a crossroads,
has taken a lot of heat for various incidents,
such as a ﬁght he was involved in at a strip
club this past summer. He has a history of
poor relationships with players and coaches,
and has even left the teamin the middle of a
season to address personal problems.

Despite this, Young is still an interesting

prospect. At 6 foot 5, the mobile quarterback p

is still a winner with a 30-17 record in his five
 seasons. If the rightoppomrunity came
around,‘I could see Young turning into an
NFL star like many people thought he once
would. I _ _ ‘

’ So, on a day where a soon-to—be college
legend decided to suspend his professional

. career, a real-life college legend that has faced

the debilitating scrutiny of ‘a sometimes dis-
appointing career has become available.

Teams’ draﬁ boards will shift, their free
agent targets will rotate, picks will swap and
suddenly one decision by 21-year-old Andrew
Luck has had a rippleeffect on the entire
National Football League. _

Who knows? Maybe he will start a trend]

The game was tied 3-3 at the time, but the
Panthers scoredthe game’s next 17 points, giving
them a 20-3 lead that they would not relinquish.

Kentucky defensivetackle Ricky Lumpldn said
that the Panthers’ physicalitythrewthe Wildcats

‘They look likean SEC teamthewaytl1eyrun
the ball They remindyoualot ofAubum andMis—
sissippi State,” Lumpkin said after the game. “We
didn’t revert to ourtrainingand notretaliate, and
that’s what hurt us was the retaliation.”

Pittwas also helped by a strong performance
on special teams. Despite the absence of former
head coach Dave Wannstedt, who coached special
teams, the Panthers held All—American Randall
Cobb to 25.25yardsperkickre111rn, just1.75 yards
above his season average.

Pitt’s Andrew Taglianetﬁ also blocked a Ken-
tucky punt shortly after the brawl in the second
quarter, and the unit also foiled a Kentucky fake
punt on the ﬁrst drive ofthe second half.

Wannstedtwas notinattendance but didspeak
to Bennett before the game.

Leittacklejason Pinkston said itwas emotional
playing without Wannstedt. V

“We all love him,” Pinkston said. “Itwas hard
.leaving the hotel, and having him not walking in
frontofus. Iwas intears. Itwas tough nothaving
him around, but we gotthis win for him.”

Pitt safety Dom-DeCicco said theteam played
not just in honor of Wannstedt, but also for the

afterthe game. _

As for Bennett, the gamewas his ﬁnal at Pitt.

‘play hard and play Welland we did.” i

Additionally, Gilbert Brown has been on a
bit of a hot streak for the Panthers recently.
Coming into Saturday’s game, Brown was av-
eraging 16.6 points a game "over the previous
ﬁve contests, while shooting58.8 percent from

the ﬁeld and an impressive 61.9 percent from _

3-point range. A ‘ ,
He continued the trend on Saturdayby going
2 for 3 from 3—point range and 3 for 6 from the
ﬁeld on his way to 14 points. '
“We just shared the ball shooting andit was
an all-around effort,” Wanamaker said. “We got
everyone contributing.” .
Late in the game, Pitt had two consecutive
defensive possessions that ended with blocks.
The second block, by Gary McGhee, just about
sealed the deal for the Panthers. McGhee had
been playingwell all night andwas 5 for 5 shoot-
ing from_the ﬁeld. ' ‘ «
Recently, McGhee’s hard work off the court

; has been paying off as Panther fans are begin-

ning to see an improvement in his offensive-
game. '

' “The last couple games have given me a lot .

of conﬁdence togkeep working and getting bet-
ter,” McGhee said after the game. “When I get
the ball down low I’m just tryingto go up strong
and ﬁnish it.”

Dixon wasn’t shy about praising McGhee
either, who ﬁnished the game with 12 points,
six rebounds and three blocks. B

“One thing you can’t question is Gary
McGhee’s work ethic,” Dixon. said after the
game. “Just this last week we’ve seen him ﬁn-
ishing better; he works relentlessly on his free

A throws and his defense has been very good.”

But the" Panthers don’t have much time to
relax after the win, as they travel to Georgetown

. this week to take on the perennial power on

Wednesday. .

“We just had a good win and now we go on
the road to play the No. 1 team in RPI, George-
town, on Wednesday,” Dixon said. “It says a lot
about our team because this conference has
been pretty good the lastcouple years, by far

' the best in the country.” y
