THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

WSGA- today‘ launched its
“Books for Freedom Campaign.”
The drive is ‘aimed at collecting
books for the Free University of.
Berlin, which has been called “an

‘island of democracy in a sea of _

totalitarianism.”

All modern college text books,

. technical books, books dealing with
, American life and German texts

are needed. Students and faculty
have been requested- to leave books‘

atgthe Student Desk, in the ist
‘ ‘ﬂoor Information Room, or in the
-twelfth ﬂoor dean of women’s of-

ﬁce.
Desperate Need

Nancy Tear, president of WSGA,
who toured Europe this summer
and Spqke to students attending
the Free University, said, “There

 a desperate need for books.”

She added, “Here is a chance for
Pitt students to show that they ‘are
interested in the education of Eu-
students by donating
books.” - '
The drive will continue for three
‘weeks. -The books will be sent to
New Jersey and shipped to Berlin._
' Six thousand students attend
the Free University, half-of them
from the Russian sector, traveling

-back and forth each day.

.- ‘SC Offers Support
“ WSGA decided to sponsor this
campaign at its commission meet-
ing last week. Isabel Lubovsky,
WSGA public relations chairman,

-suggested the idea and was elected

chairman. Student Congress passed
a resolution on Monday to support
the drive. Men’s Council will be
contacted for their support.
Fifteen women were chosen
from WSGA commission to act as
a committee for the drive. They
are soliciting books from faculty
and students. '

The project is being sponsored

» nationally by the National Confer-

encevof Christians and Jews.

Chest Drive Sets Plans

 ForAnnual Campaign

The Pitt Chest’s have only one classroom solicitation
this year, to be held in the fall semester. ' -

This policy was decided by
on a motion by Theodore W. Bid-1}
dle, dean of men, at a committee
meeting last Friday which of-'
ﬁcially opened the Chest Drive..
Previously, contributions were
solicited ‘both in the spring and
fall.» A
Ronald Ecker, chairman of the
committee, appointed a sub-com-
mittee to investigate the addition-
al possibility of a Pitt Chest
“Week” in the spring. Various

be used to raise money, but no
direct solicitation would be made.

This _year’s classrooms solicita-
tion will be held on Wednesday
and Thursday, Nov. 14 and 15.
The goals for the various schools
have not been set.

Ecker\ says, -“Last year's drive

“This was because not enough
students made contributions to.
the drive. The only way we can
reach our goal is for every Pitt
student to: contribute his share.”

A Hobby to the Director

By ELLINORE STONE
Speech therapy is a fascin-
ating hobby as well as a job
to Miss‘ Betty McWilliams,

recently appointed director of .

the University’s speech clinic.
As head of the clinic, it is’

’ her- job, with the aid‘ of a staff

of seven, to meet and diag-
nose the students and those of the
general public who come to the
clinic for aid. .

In her_ experiences with speech .

therapy, Miss McWilliams relates
that‘ one of the most diﬁicult cases
was that of an eight year old boy
who could ‘not speak’ at all.
. . Thought Retarded

 The Ichild was thought to be
severely mentally retarded. Upon

clinical examination, however, it ‘

was found that the amount of re-
tardation was not enough to, cause
lspeech failure.. _ _ _

In treating the child, Miss Mc-
Williams and her associates began
right at the. beginning with the

babbling stage, urging him to just

_make ' ‘noises. ’ Gradually‘ they
taught him to attach a name to an

object and tried to interest him .

however, is not yet ‘known.

‘For Better ,lInde_rstanJing      

The United Nations today looks back on six years of

* strife and turmoil, a period marked by large defeats, small
triumphs and a state of continuous crisis.. The infant organ-
ization has been faced with a world that never, submitted
to international_control by any other means than force,

‘a. world that has felt its right was in self-interest and as world
where only such self-interest guaranteed a survival in the
past. - ‘

only routine problems, situations where logic and reason
might prevail. It has always had to grapple with conflicts
in which the seeds of world destruction were "pregnant.

In addition to their diplomatic functions the delegates
at Lake Success have had to cope with a highly skeptical
and hostile world, especially a world of partisan politics in
this country. Our delegates have suffered by having the
ground cut from under them by ignorant and irresponsi-
ble politicians in Washington.

Only time and many concrete successes can placate the
hostility and skepticism. At the same a broader knowledge
"and understanding of what the UN is and what it is trying
to do can do much to assure its acceptance. _ -

Here on the campus students and faculty members have

should clear up many of the doubts about the‘ technical
workings of the UN. -' ' ~~~ ' i

i The model Security Council’s selection of topics is es-
p_e“cially apt. The China Question has been the bone of
contention the past two years between the warring fac-
tions in the UN. ‘ .

Everyone who has any interest at all in world affairs
or national affiars should make a point of attending the
sessions. What goes on in the far corners of the world can
have a great affect on life in the backwash of the world.

SAE's’Defendt Bus Trip     A -

Editor, _ ‘ i . "
The Pitt News: ' ' ‘ - W

Concerning the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bus trip
to Michigan State which has been so unjustly
criticized in the Pitt News. V '

The basis for your argument (which is not
necessarily the Univer_isty’s) seems to be in your
belief that the train to Michigan State College is
the University social function _for the week-end

of ‘October 26 and 27th, and that in scheduling our V
‘ trip to coincide with it we violated a University

rule. Isn’t there a footballggame in East Lansing,
Mi'ch., on October 27th? The game, as we see it,
‘and not the train trip (or the bus trip), is the
social function at that time. "We are sending 37
men (over 70% of our chapter) on our so—called‘
“wildcat venture” to ‘Michigan to make sure that
our team knows the Pitt student body is behind
them, especially the SAE’s. ’

We aren’t going by the student train, which

is an excellent idea, because it wouldn't give .us
time to participate in the social events which our

chapter at Michigan State College has scheduled ‘

in our honor in conjunction with the game. How-
ever, we’ll be at the stadium Saturdayto cheer

our team, and represent both SAE and the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh.’ 1 . .

Frosh Blanda Rated
All-Around Performer  

By JIM MARKS

The future Pitt football picture has brightened quite a
bit withthe coming of triple threat»-freshman Paul Blanda.

Paul stepped right out of high ‘school and into the role

of Coach Tom Hamilton’s handyman. He has done'nearly all
the punting thus far this ,season,,been—on the pitching end
of a touchdown pass and contributed his share to what ground

-attack the Panthers have’ had.

Brother Georgea Pro

As if this wasn’t enough to keep
the frosh from Youngwood, Pa., he
has been seen backing the line and
has inherited the point-after’-
touchdown and ﬁeld goal chores’
‘from Nick Bolkovac. He seems
destined to follow in the footsteps
of his famous brother, George",
who is the extra point spcialist for-
the Chicago Bears.

He added. both points from
placement in the Duke game, an-
‘otherat Iowa along with a perfect

~ 22-yard ﬁeld goal. At this rate, he.
. could easily break Bolk0_va'c’s all-»
time record for conversions."

59—Yard TD Pass

Paul had his best day against
Iowa when he added the'previ-
ously mentioned placements and

' tossed a touchdown pass from a
fourth down kick formation that
covered 59 yards.

As a punter, he has accumulated
an average of 37 yards per try in
four games. One ofhis kicks last
Saturday against Notre Dame
traveled 70 yards in the air.

Line-Backer, Too

When the Panthers go to a ﬁve
man line, Blanda gets to throw his
180 pounds around as a line-back-_
er.‘ He is a natural ‘ defensive.
sparkplug and smooth diagnostic-
ian of enemy plays.

Coach Hamilton has used Paul
for kickoﬁs and it’s seldom that
his boots haven’t reached the op-
posing goal line.

Also Blocking Back
, He is a tall rangy lad with
enough ability and aggressiveness
to make him a standout at any as-
signment. He was used as the
blocking back in Captain Tom’s
latest experiment with the single-
wing. _ '

Here’s a freshman

really made himself known in a

The season thus far has given

about, but Blanda is one of the
reasons to look to the future with
hope. ‘

Warriner saw limited action last
week and Schmidt had" the mis-
fortune of being injured on the last

mark the ﬁrst time this season that
the Panthers will be at full

was a strong indication that the

422, yards and ﬁve touchdowns in a Notre Dame romp, 33-0.

was enrolled I had to study some-

This confusion ﬁnally led him

islands of the Arcﬁc.

.North of Arctic Circle
The islands, which lie north of
the Arctic circle and 500 miles
from the nearest civilization, are
part of‘ the Canadian Arctic.
The Canadian government com-
missioned the party to ﬁnd out as
much as possible about the terri-
tory—more for general informa-
tion than military strategy.

Dr. Jenness says it was nice to
be away from civilization: quiet
and peaceful, with no news to
spoil the tranquility of it all.

The men lived in waterproof
tents staked on the frozen ground.
They ate chieﬂy canned foods and
fresh potatoes and eggs while

2 their supply’ lasted.

During‘July, when "there was
tw_enty—four hours of ‘daylight, the
group worked ‘for days without
sleep. « 5

-When asked what they did for
relaxation Dr. Jenness ‘replied,
“Work.” .

V ‘Good Opportunity

He said the men realized that
they would never be able to make
such an expedition privately and

Luckies taste better. So. Be Happy—Go

so they wanted to do as much" and
see as much as they could while
they had the opportunity.

-At times the curiosity of the
party almost led to disaster. On
several occasions they ﬂew too
low and narrowly avoided wreck-
ing the plane. During another
ﬂight they landed the amphibious
craft in what they presumed to
be a deep river.

The river was not deep and the
party had to shove away chunks
of ice before they could free the
plane. _

“We were pretty excited at the
time, but looking back, I guess
things weren’t too serious,” the
professor explained. _

Dr. J enness wrote an extensive

factual report of _the trip_ for thef

Canadian government and used
much of the information he gath-
ered ‘for his Ph.D. thesis.

Degrees from Cambridge

The Professor received his B.A.
and MA. degrees from Cambridge
in the summer of 1947. While still
a student, -he married a -girl from
Brussels, Belgium, who was then
working for the Belgian Embassy
in London. He insists it is the
best thing he’s ever done!

Dr. Jenness feels that Pitt in
general, «is friendlier than eastern
schools. _ .

Pitt Cheer-jerker Says
Spirit, Noise Effective

By JOAN HIRSH
Not many students know much about Pitt’s head cheer-

. leader. But Jack Hardman, a

senior and physical education

major, does a terriﬁc job of stirring up school. spirit at the
games. He has the game’s interest at heart and wants an

a winning team.
To have that winning team,
Jack says, the football team needs

g student support. He knows, be-
, cause he has talked to members

of -the squad.
As Uack put it, “Players get the

-feeling there are a lot of people’

behind them, but they have only
,11 men to face. They can sense

.when the fans are for them and

when they are not.” Coaches also
seem to think that cheering has

Va“ deﬁnite place on the football‘
_ ﬁeld. '

\’Vould Add Girls

‘If it were up to Hardmanfthe
cheerleader would like_
girls cheering with the boys, as

— they would perk up itnterest and

enthusiasm. The University,
however, has turned thumbs down

on V this idea.

At the Pitt-Duke game, Jack
noticed that the new cheers didn’t

ggo off too well at ﬁrst, but‘ ‘after
7~ repeating. them, the _fans picked
up very fast. He felt this game

had the best cheering he has heard
in his four years with the squad.
He attributes the spirit to high

' school students.

The cheerers try to please the
crowds .in many ways. They de-

‘veloped a plan for the various

cheers; one is to use short cheers
btween plays so as not to inter
fere with the game.
’ ‘ Good Response
Hardman said this year there

" has been more response for cheer— I
