Evening Ceremonies

Planned for June 1 1

For the first time since 1932, the
Stadium will be deserted on com-
mencement day—deserted for the
Cathedral lawn.

conducted on the Belleﬁeld avenue
lawn at 7:30 o’clock on June 11 this
year, it was announced officially
today. It will be the first gradua-
tion ceremony ever to take place
on the lawn of the Cathedral and

ior many years.

Seating accommodations will be
made for over 9,000 persons who
will witness commencement from
chairs set on the lawn extending
from the Cathedral to the Heinz
Memorial chapel.

The speakers platform will be
constructed near the Bellefield ave-
nue entrance.

Details of the program and the
seating arrangements were not
available, for speciﬁc plans con-
cerning speaker and the other spe-
cial features of the program have
not been completed.

According to University officials,
commencement exercises will have
academic atmosphere if conducted
in the shadow of the Cathedral and
it corresponds with the policy of
having the Cathedral. the center of
University functions and activities.

The chairs which will seat the
attendants to the program will be
attached to two-by-fours resting
on the ground to prevent the chair
legs from sinking into the lawn.

For nine years the commence-
ment program was conducted in the
Stadium, usually beginning at 10:30
o’clock in the morning.

Wilson Asks BIDTC Students
To Wear Uniforms in Class

An “order of the day” for every
school day until May 7 was issued
this week by Colonel Ralph W.
Wilson, professor and head of the

department of military science and

tactics.

The order requires all students
registered in any course in military
science to wear their uniforms on
every day during which they have
a military science class. This or-
der applies to men in the basic
courses as well as the juniors and
seniors in the advanced course.

Previous to this order by Colonel
Wilson, uniforms were required of
ROTC men only on Wednesday, the
day of regimental drill.

It was announced by the military
department that the reason for this
unprecedented change in policy is
to accustom the ROTC men to their
uniforms after the lay-off during

the winter when no regimental

drills or dress parades take place.

The annual inspection of the reg-
iment by an official inspector from
the headquarters of the third corps
area will be held on May 7 this
year, earlier than in previous years.
This was given by the officials of
the department as one of the rea-
sons for accustoming the ROTC
men to their uniforms.

Another reason given for the or-
der is that instructors will have
more chance to point out errors in
appearance of the men during the
class periods. At this time, it was
pointed out, a smaller number of
men are under the supervision of a
single officer and it is easier to
che-ck on appearance in this way.

Several student ofﬁcers of the
corps declared that the appearance

YMCA Elects

New President

Rudy Holloman, C42, has been
elected president of the YMCA.
Other of’ﬁcers for the 1941-42 school
year are Andrew Brethauer, C42,
vice—president, and James Rial,
E43, secretary.

Although formal induction will
not take place until the annual
banquet of the association on May
14, the new officers begin serving
in their new positions this week.
These oﬂicers, along with other
members of the YMCA Cabinet, will
attend the spring conference of Y
delegates from all Western Penn-
sylvania colleges late this month,
for brief training in leadership and
program planning.

Holloman. a member of Sigma
Chi fraternity, this year served on
the association cabinet as chairman
of the cultural growth committee.
and was chairman of the Pitt del-
egation to the general YMCA con-
ference at Penn State earlier in
the year.

To be eligible for presidency of
the association, under new revision
plans, a member must have served
two full years as a member of the
cabinet or one of the standing com-
mittees. Other ofﬁcers’ eligibility
includes two semesters’ member-
ship in the cabinet or on a stand-
ing committee.

Added to the functions of the
governing body of the college are
the following: to aim for a closer
relationship between the students
and faculty of the College; to work
in the interests of raising the schol-
astic rating of the College; and to
institute a program which would
be of beneﬁt to the students men-
tally, physically, and morally,”
Tedick stated.

“Main attempt of the reorgani-
zation, which has been studied for
the past month is for CA to act as
the oﬂicial student governing body
of the college in addition to pre-
senting and directing all the social
functions of the College, which up
until now has been the almost ex-
clusive function of CA,” Te-dick ex-
plained.

Emergency

Carlson Opens
Anti--Syphilis
Drive Monday

Beginning next Monday at 9
o’clock and lasting until the fol-
lowing Friday at 5 o’clock, the
Meii and ’\Vo1nen’s Student
health services in cooperation
with the Pitt News and the Pitts-
burgh Syphilis Control board will
offer free Wassermann tests to any
University student.

The Wassermann blood test, one
of medical sciences foremost strides,
indicates by a positive reaction the
appearance of syphilis. This year
the tests are again offered to the
student body as a preventive and
educational measure.

The two main reasons for mak-
ing the tests available to students
were cited by Dr.  C. Carlson,
director of the Men’s Student
Health service in an interview
Monday. Dr. Carlson said the main
purpose of the tests is to discover
any cases which are now prevalent.
The other purpose is of educational
value, every student should be able
to discuss intelligently the facts
about syphilis.

“But the education should be
through feeling {rather than words,
for we can learn more about it in
three minutes by taking the test
than by talking about it a whole
week.”

Dr. Auleene Marley Jamison, di-
rector of the Women’s student
Health service, repeated what Dr.
Carlson had said as she pledged
the help of the women in the cam-
paign on syphilis. Dr. Jamison de-
clared that she also looks on the
campaign as an educational one,
since each year the number of pos-
itive reactions has been entirely
neglible.

“The real value of the cam-
paign is to be found in the indi-
vidual’s knowledge of the tech-
nique, purpose, and usefulness of
the test. Perhaps most important
of all is the broadening. of the
intelligent inﬂuence of our stu-
dents in their own communities of
the future.”

Anticipating any questions as to
what the method of taking the tests
might be, Dr. Carlson explained the
procedure. Blood is taken from a
vein in the arm by a needle so sharp
that it causes scarcely any palm,
a tourniquet first having been ap-
plied just above the spot‘ where
the needle is to enter. The needle
enters the vein  draws out
about five to ‘eight’ ‘cubic, c'entixne-
ters of blood. , I 

The main part of the test is then
made, the’ blood is analyzed and
tested for pdsitivc or _'n€Tgative. re-
actions, posit'i'tfe réajctioo’ indicat-
ing syp_hilis. The laboratory work
takes se‘v'e'ral ‘days and in some
cases 21‘  to 3.,-or'np',Ieté' and as
soon as the _reports are made to
the health service, the individuals
who took the test will receive their
report. _

All reports are conﬁdential and
no reports, names, or percentage
ﬁgures, will be disclosed.

Director of the Pittsburgh Syph-
ilis Control board Dr. Millard C.
Hanson, cleclared that he would
like to make blood tests for every-
body “as much a matter of routine
as seeing your dentist.” John ‘St.
Pieter, is assisting Dr. Hanson in
his work  director of the board.

The .City-‘County laboratory
makes all of tliicfdiagnopses and re-
ports thc results to the health serv-
ices. Similar tests taken privately
cost from S2 to $5.

College Plans Medical Aptitude 
Tests for Pre-Meds on May 1 A

Medical aptitude tests will be
taken on May 1 by 325 pre-med:-:
as compared to 200 pre-meds last

year in 132 Cathedral at 2:30

o'clock. announces Omar C. Held,
assistant dean of the College.
It is required that all students

who expect to apply for entrance
to a medical school by fall of 1942
take this examination.

Students should make application
immediately at 7 State Hall by pay-
ment of a one dollar fee. They will
receive an admittance slip for the
test.

At the time the fee is paid. the
student will receive a practice
sheet which should be studied until

he is thoroughly iainiliar with the
techniques. The practice sheet will
admit pre-mcds to the examination,
but must be returned to the proctors
before receiving the regular exam-
ination folders.

All applicants should note that
the test is now one of the normal
requirements for admission to a
medical school. and that if students
plan to enter a medical school in
1942 they should arrange to take
the test on the date indicated above.
It is not necessary that all pre-
medical requirements be completed
at the time the test is taken if the
1‘cqui1‘€ments will be compete in
time for entrance to medical school
in the fall of 1942.

A LITTLE LIGHT on the gloomy question
of the college student and the draft was forth-
coming last week from Washington.

From the office of the American Council on
Education came a statement which, though typ-
ically indeﬁnite, can be interpreted as giving the
green light to most draft age college students
planning to take courses in summer sessions.

Having been informed by national draft
headquarters of a recently adopted ruling (de-
tails not disclosed), the council issued the fol-
lowing statement:

“ f a college student’s order number is such
that he will probably not be called until after
the summer session, semester, or college year is
well along and he has enrolled for such session
in good faith, it is our conviction that the local
draft board will decide that in such a case an
unusual hardship exists and will postpone his in-
duction until the end of the session, if his order
number does come up during such time.”

his being the ﬁrst decision on the college
student since the Burke-Wadsworth bill went
through with the provision postponing collegiate
induction until July, it goes without saying that
we are glad that some deﬁnite interest in the
college student is being shown by the powers
that be.

It is far from adequate satisfaction, however.
It is still no inkling as to what the college man
planning to continue in the fall may or can do.

The college student should have been given
the courtesy of this information by this time.
With last week’s announcement from the Pres-
ident that another R-day is being planned for
the summer for the beneﬁt of those men who
have reached 21 since last October, the situation
becomes even more indefinite for thousands of
students all over the country and hundreds right
here on campus.

The college student should know now, this
spring, not next fall, his relation to selective serv-
ice training, and whether the July ’4l dead—
line will be extended one year. The student
should be supplied with more speciﬁc informa-
tion of how this particular course of study ﬁts in
with the program. Especially is this true in the
case of medical students, engineers, chem spec-
ials, and other technical students, who have been
gloriously kicked around by various and sun-
dry local draft boards throughout the country.

We don’t know from whom this information
should come; but the American Council on Ed-
ucation, representing 600 colleges and univer-
sities, seems like a fair lobbying agency for the
college student.

We suggest that the university members of
the council exert the necessary pressure on Con-
gress and/or national draft headquarters to in-
form the students before the close of the school
year.

More Information
On Great, Good Mr. F.

It seems that we must have said something derog-
atory of Henry Ford. For in our mail we found the fol-
lowing communication from a boy who lives in Mr. E.
T. Weir’s company town, Weirton.

Editor, the Pitt News:

Of late, the Pitt News has given me the impression
that Henry Ford is a fool, a torturer of mankind.
‘Doesn’t he employ “strong-arm” methods to pro-
tect his property? Doesn’t he refuse toaccept union-
ism? Doesn’t he live off the sweat of labor? Down
with Ford! He is an individualist!
' Few men in this world have done as much for the
'uplifting.. of mankind as has Henry Ford, and yet we
I have been clamoring for his scalp ever since he re-
fused to recognize unions. Here is a man who pays
his labor more than any other employer of his status.
Here is a man who treats his employees like human
beings. Here" is a man who, regardless of his increas-
ing" age and great wealth, still works for the advance-
I ment of the‘industry which he created. And yet, we
cry “crucify him!” And why? '
Certainly it isn’t because of wages, for his fac-
. tories pay as- much as any other in the United States.
Nor can it be the working conditions, for he is no
more a “slave-driver” than any other employer, big
or small. Then what is wrong with Henry Ford?
‘ ‘Oh, that’s easy! He won't recognize unions! He
" refuses to let a few cheap, low-down, contemptible
"union leaders, chosen, not for their intelligence, but
for their roudiness (sic), tell him how to run his
business! He is an individualist!
vLet me tell you brother, I’m proud of Mr. Ford!
If he is astubborn fool, may he always be one. If he
is a torturer of mankind, may we have more of
., them. If he is an individualist, then allvpower to
him to stick by his guns! - .— r .
" ' _ , John Madias,.C44

Weirton, W. Va. '

We feel sort of responsible for this lad’s state of
mind. We haven’t provided him with enough informa-
tion about the great, good, humane Mr. Henry Ford
and his great, good, humane company. And so we’ve
gathered some facts about Hank and his boys which
should better equip Weirton John Madias to prove that
Henry Ford is a (“stubborn fool” and a “torurer of
mankind,” as he so well expresses it. _

1.‘ The following are excerpts from Mr. Ford’s. _testi-
mony during his libel suit against the Chicago Tribune
3. Isl-live there been any revolutions in this country,

Mr. Ford? A. Yes. _

When? A. (after a pause) One in 1812.
Q. In 1812? Any other time? A. I don’t know of
any other.

Q. What was the United States composed of before
the Revolution? A. Land, I guess. _
Q. There is an impression that you cannot read. Will
you read this? A. No.

Q. In View of what you have said, you would not
question that “Ignorant” is a proper characteristic of
you? A. As I said, I am ignorant of most things.

2. Henry Ford started his anti-semitic career when
he published the fake “Protocols of Zion.” He received
a medal from Adolf Hitler. He employs W. J. Cam-
eron, of the Anglo-Saxon Federation, an anti-semitic
organization.

3. The Ford Motor company has had seven NLRB
orders issued against it for unfair labor practices.

One investigation of these practices showed that a‘

“strong-armed” squad at the Ford plant in Dallas,
Texas, kidnapped and tarred and feathered Herbert
Harris, an organizer for the SWOC, beat up Baron
DeLois, an organizer for the auto workers union, pull-
ed George W. Chandler, CIO organizer, out of a car

Tucker Lists, Explains
Planks of Association

Editor, The Pitt News’:
Since the Independent party plat-

form was ﬁrst presented at the party ‘ “

convention, many questions " have

been asked as to just what the four ‘

planks mean and why an Independ-

ent majority can put them into ef-
Here are the answers to ' :

fect.
some of these questions.

1. “Continued insistence on merit

in all committee ‘appointments.’’.

The Independent Party represents
the interests of the large mass of

students. It is a unitary and note"

confederate type of organization.
It depends for its support upon the_

student body and not upon any._

group of organizations. This sup-
port depends upon its record..and
not upon satisfying the desires of
any group or groups. Therefore
the "party must appoint the ‘most
capable persons for every position
or lose student support. "It cannot

do it by favoring any group.

A 2. “A working not a shirking
majority.” The fraternity majority
has shown itself inefﬁcient in the
administration of its duties. Com-
mittee appointments have been de-
layed and the enforcement of by-
laws has been neglected. Assured
of a fairly constant vote every
spring they have been content with
merely the prestige of control. They
know their organizational support
will be the same regardless of their
record. The Independents, on the
other hand, must count upon work
well-done to merit their election.

3. “Continue the many projects
initiated by independents during the
past year.” Independents have pre-
sented many projects in SFA which
are of great interest to the inde-
pendent student. They are endeav-
oring to secure cheaper transpor-
tation, books, and housing for the
students. These projects should be
continued. The present majority
has no responsibility to those for
whom these measures are intended.
They, themselves, have presented
no signiﬁcant legislation to the as-
sembly during the entire year.

4. “A streamlined and effective
student government structure.” The
Independent party believes the
present structure could be greatly
improved. It has no political inter-
est in maintaining the status quo.

Phi Sig

the TI‘ By Mendell Cross

The engineering school is a house divided these
days. The cause for this serious condition may be
traced to a yarn which has been spun in and out of
State hall, up Bayard Street to Shadyside academy,
and back to the cozy corners of the Cathedral. The
story originated, as rumor has it, in Dean Holbrookls
If you have had the conﬁdence of someone
who had the conﬁdence of someone else you already
have heard about the corporation personnel man who
made the clean a startling offer. " "

.“If you send me six engineers,” he said, “I’ll take

That’s thestory--no more, no less. Since we have
not heard .of six Bus Ads being placed, it is a fair
bet that Dean Holbrook did not endorse this parasitic
plan for aiding thetreputed lounge lizards of the‘ Uni-
versity. " '

Three Schools . . . V
On the surface the average engineer has laughed
this whole thing off,-but as typical of the species he
has dug to the roots of the issue and is not too happy
about what he sees. The boys are divided into three

I schoolsof thought. The “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

group proudly ‘deny that they are in any way related
to" “those loafers.” A «

“An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!” is the
battle cry of a small party now convinced that justice
has perished from the earth. This second group " is
slowly being absorbed by the majority party which
ﬂaunts the banner “What the hell are we——horses?”
Eventually, I believe, the entire school will become
afﬁliated Wi_th this group which calls its meetings to
order with the word “Whoa!” You might as well
admit it, engineers, you’re the ones who pull the
wagon.

The Commodity . . .

The average engineer is enthusiastic about his sta-
tion in life primarily because he is a bug on engineer-
ing. He has thought of nothing else since he received
that ﬁrst Erector set some Christmas long past. Be-
cause of his enthusiasm he is easy prey for those busi-
ness sharpies who consider him a valuable commodity
in a market over which they hold a monopoly.

To big business the engineer is a synonym for proﬁt;
he is the horse which pulls the wagon. Research, in-
vention, designing, production planning, and all the
other components which mean “life” to the engineer
mean only dollars to the men who rule’ him. Certainly
the business-man is not idealistic. He will run the
horse on a minimum of oats and load the wagon until
the axles bend. Somewhere on the wagon rides the
Bus Ad keeping score and reporting how much the
engineer is earning for the company.

The State hall-ers, regardless of party, are agreed
that the best way for any company to be assured of
six engineers is to offer a three year contract at $200
a month. If that company must offer jobs to non-
engineers in lieu of the engineer’s wages, the engineer
would like a voice in the matter.

Why not hire the engineer’s ﬁancee so that, per-
haps, with their combined salaries they could afford to
get married and live on a scale beﬁtting a college
graduate‘?

“The City of Man,” one of the
new books on the Alldred room
shelves, an unusual essay written
by a committee of seventeen Amer-

ican Alien writers, outlines a possi-
ble city of man as Augustine out-
lined a possible city of God in an-
other age of disorder.

Among the new novels on the
“browsing room” shelves, “Sum—

highly successful attempt at captur-
ing something of the confusion of
twentieth century Europe. “H. M.

Jan Struthers, author of last sum-
mer’s popular “Mrs. Miniver,” is
also the author of a book of poems,
“The Glass Blower.”

Other new books in the Alldred

of the Russian experiment by Man-
ya Gordon, Taylor Caldwell’s new
pot-boiler, “The Earth Is the

Chatter

‘zoom the gicleliaext

by Bill Jlc-EIu.‘ain
Sports Editor

 

For the ﬁrst time in three years, we are privileged to report

that the Pitt baseball team shows promise.

To anyone who has

watched Coach Mitterling’s kiddies cavorting through some of the
more lurid moments in recent Panther baseball history, such a pro-

nouncement must come as a shock.

bandied about loosely.

But startling as the report seems, it is fundamentally based on

Such words are not to be

truth. Already the Panthers are within one game of matching their

1940 win record. The two and two split against Southern teams

is the best a Pitt nine has done since the Dixie tours were inaug-

urated in 1939.

In fact, the victory over Richmond was the ﬁrst

time the Panthers had topped a Southern club in 10 starts.

Iones, Malloy Feature

Most pleasing feature of the four game jaunt was the pitching

form of righthanders Edgar Jones and Bob Malloy. Jones, although

shelved as a hurler by a sore arm most of last season, scored one of

the three Pitt wins, taking over West Virginia. Both of the South-
ern triumphs are credited to the Scranton ace.

His work becomes more remarkable when considered in light
of the fact that his spring training workouts were limited to brief

sessions of nothing more than pitching to a catcher.

He twirled

four creditable innings against Richmond, then pitched brilliant
ball the next day for nine innings against North Carolina State.
Thirteen innings in two days isn’t bad at all, particularly when
you consider that he allowed only three runs, one of them earned.

Wills Victim of Errors

Malloy worked 6 1/3 innings at Virginia, then followed up
with 2 2/3 at Richmond. He was scheduled to start against Duke,

but the game was rained out.

Against the Cavaliers, he yielded

but one hit in six innings, then fell victim to errors and a tiring arm
in the seventh. He was wild at Richmond but snuffed out a Spider

rally and saved the win for Jones.

Junior Joe VVilk is another moundsman who should help out
this spring. \Vilk, a natural low ball pitcher, had the misfortune
to run into a low ball hitter in the Virginia game, but after the
Cavalier catcher had blasted one over the fence on Joe’s ﬁrst toss,
Wilk had no further trouble in finishing the inning.

Against Richmond he was moderately eﬁectiv-e, but ﬁrst base-
man Johnny Brown put him in the hole at South Carolina by throw-
ing away the third out. Had Brown ’s throw to home, which would
have cut oﬂ a run and ended the inning, been good, Wilk might
have had a pretty fair day. The same game also made veteran Ed
Haluska and sophomore Carmelo Ranii look bad, but‘ the calibre
of the Panther ﬁelding against the Gamecocks was so poor that no
fair estimate of Haluska’s and Ranii’s chucking can be made.

. Panthers Click on Offense
Oﬂensively, Pitt looks good, as usual.

Second baseman Eddie

Straloski looks like the best bet to lead the club in hitting while
Jones, Ernie Bonelli, Frank Goelz, and Guy Guadagino should add

the necessary punch from time to time.

Best looking newcomer,

not counting Malloy, is Brown, a slick-ﬁelding left handed ﬁrst
sucker who looks better just standing still than have all the previous
Panther ﬁrstbasemen rolled into one.

_ The short schedule will prevent the Panthers from achieving
much national prominence in a baseball way, but should Mitterling
be‘ able to iron out several ﬁelding difficulties on the left side of the
diamond, his dream of a winning season can be an easy actuality.

Opens Practice
For Golf Team

With the hope of bettering last
year’s mark of 4 wins and 7 losses,
the Panther golf team has begun
workouts at Coach Art Underwood's
Alcomo Country club. The local
divot diggers open their 1941 cam-
paign with the Army at West Point
ten days hence, and hope to be in
top shape by then.

Underwood has a hard job in
front of him as he endeavors to
mold a winner. Four members of
last year’s squad, Bill Reilly, Jim
Kennedy, Larry Geyer, and Homer
McC1intock, have graduated leav-
ing Underwood with only four ex-
perienced men.

This year’s schedule is more at-
tractive than that of last season,
and may prove an incentive for
Panther golfers to do better. Grove
City has been dropped from the
schedule and has been replaced by
Army and Slippery Rock. Besides
the trip to West Point, this season’s
travels include trips to State Col-
lege, Pa., Washington, Pa., and An-
napolis. The local squad will visit
the State Cdllege campus three
times during the season when they
meet Penn State, Penn, Georgetown,
and Princeton.

Pitt’s tentative ﬁrst team football
players started the spring drills on
the right side of the ledger last
Wednesday afternoon when they
trounced a comparatively weak sec-
ond team combination, 25-0, in the
ﬁrst of the scheduled intra—squad
games.

Bill “Snakehips” Dutton and full-
back John Ross each tallied two
scores while end Stan Gervelis
added a point after touchdown to
roll up the 25 points.

In the hope that favorable
weather continues, Pitt’s coaching
staff plans to hold the second intra-
squad game this coming Saturday
morning.

VVAA Jottings

Get ready, girls, for the ﬁrst out-
door sport of the year! Today, at
1:30 o’clock on the Cathedral lawn,
an exhibition of that popular sport,
archery, will be given by coach
Harry Ussack.

Here’s a chance to learn why you
don’t hit the bull’s eye 10 times out

what to do about it, according to a

In their opener of the season, the
Panthers met and lost to the Uni-
versity of Virginia, one of the

, strongest teams in the South. The

Pitt baseballers“ fell” before the
Cavaliers 6-5“in‘a‘ heart-breaker. ’

Panther hurler Bob Malloy held
the Virginians well‘. in‘ check and
allowed onlyone .hit- until the sev-

' enth when the Cavaliers capped a

six-run rally with a home run off
relief pitcher Joe Wilk. The game
was called at theend of the eighth
inning when a thunderstorm made
the ﬁeld unplayable.

Perhaps the brightest spot in the
Panther defeat at the hands of the
Virginia team was the potency of
both the pitching and hitting de-
partments. In the former, Pitt
looked good, particularly when
Malloy did the hurling. As for
hitting, the Panthers had plenty of
power with catcher Guy Guadag-
nino and third baseman Ernie Bon-
elli doing the heaviest slugging.
Defeat Richmond University

L e a v i n g Charlottesville, the
Panthers journeyed to Richmond,
Virginia, where they met the Spiders
of Richmond university. Here the
Panthers played better than aver-

mond team by a 9-5 score. The
Pitt nine ran into trouble a number
of times but always managed to
come out of it before any real dam-
age was done.

entry will be making it plenty
tough for the Fraternity boys and
might even score an unexpected
upset.

Phi Gams Top Fraternities

The Phi Gams will be leading the
Fraternity attack. In the recent
elimination tournament, the Fijis
scored 33 points, 24 more than the
runner-up PiKA group.

Defending champions, Phi Epsi-
lon Pi, as well as swimmers from
Pi Lambda Phi, and Delta Tau Del-
ta, will all be contributing valua-
ble points to the Fraternity aquatic
cause.

Well fortiﬁed in the 120-yard
medley, the Phi Gams have Potter,
Bitner, and Mitchell, while the Phi
Eps have the three B’s, Baddock,
Barrish, and Briskin as a safety
measure. But the Independents
medley trio of Paul Kurhan, Israel
Grossman, and Johnny Notero swam
the distance in 1213.7.

Independent Splashes

The Fijis have a ﬁrst place po-
tential in Potter for the 40-yard
backstroke event. And the 80-yard
relay quartet of McNeil, Campbell,
Roberts, and Mitchell, from the
same house, should ﬁnish at least
second in the all-campus meet.

Competing against the Fiji swim-
mers in the 80-yard relay, the In-
dependents have Pete Hommack,
Joe Donahue, Norty Rappaport, and
Joe Petrone. In the Independent
elimination, the four swimmers

Faculty Present
Varied Views
About Success

5 Participants Differ
011 Reading of Books

. By CHARLES CAMARATA
Five members of the faculty par-
‘cipated in a panel discussion at
Pitt Town meeting Monday and at-
tempted to deﬁne student success,
or “What It Takes to Make Good
in College.”

Headed by William L. Hammaker,
executive secretary of the YMCA,
who acted as informal chairman,
the faculty members were Dr.
Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant pro-
fessor of modern languages; Miss
Mary McKenna, instructor in Eng-
lish; Miss Blossom L. Henry, assist-
ant professor of modern languages;
and Roy H. Umble, instructor in
speech.

Deﬁnition of Success

The discussion was opened by
Hammaker who presented the topic,
and Dr. Lohstoeter followed im-
mediately by asking that the term
“making good” be deﬁned.

tated Dr. Lohstoeter, “What do
you mean by ‘making good,’ mean-
ing success? It seems to me that
there are as many deﬁnitions of
success as there are individual stu-
dents. I think that ﬁrst of all they
come to school to learn something,
to be a student.”

Next, Umble gave his deﬁnition
of success as “doing whatever
you’re supposed to do, or turning it
down, that is, know your own abili-
ty.”

Hammaker Disagrees

In the course of her deﬁnition of
college success, Miss McKenna
stated that students neglect to read
enough good books. From then on
the discussion touched on various
aspects of student success in college,
ranging from a quotation from Im-
manuel Kant by Mr. Hammaker to
a deﬁnition of “tolerance” by Dr.
Lohstoter.

Hammaker suggested that the
faculty members give more concrete
deﬁnitions of the term “making
good” so as to permit a short space
at the end of the hour for students
to ask questions. The term was
then deﬁned more concretely and
the discussion returned to the sub-
ject of “good books.”

I-Iammaker disagreed with Dr.
Lohstoeter, Miss Henry, and Umble
in that books should be read and re-
read to get the full meaning from
them rather than read to see what
they had to offer.

McKenna. Replies

“The student should have a mo-
tivation for reading a book,” said
Hammaker. “Say for example, a
student had the opportunity of; lis-
tening to a‘ meeting of the "Labor
Relations board; he could then go
to the books and read all about labor
relations to satisfy his curiosity.”

Miss McKenna then disagreed
with Hammaker’. “I think it’s the
other way~v_aroun~5i,’

Student Opinion Survey Reveals Nearly

Half of College Men Prefer Air Force

Coincident with Mayor Cornelius
D. Scully’s proclamation of Flying
Cadet week now being observed in
Pittsburgh, students in colleges and
universities throughout the country
expressed preference for the air
corps over all other branches of
the military service.

In a nation wide poll conducted
by the Student Opinion Surveys of
America, with headquarters at the
University of Texas. it was found
that close to half the nation’s col-
lege men would rather join the air
force than either the army or navy,

if they had to enter the armed
forces.
Sectional Difference

Further investigation indicated

that our section of the country, that
is the Middle Atlantic states, was
least enthusiastic about aviation,
with. only 39 per cent, still a larger
vote than either the army or navy
received. The Far West, where 57
per cent favored the air service,
and the West Central, where 55
per cent preferred ﬂying, were the
strongest supporters.

However, when the students were
asked if they would leave school
and enter air service if the U. S.
had to send an army to aid Britain,
less than one sixth said they would.
Local Enlistment

In conjunction with the drive
to enlist more Pittsburgh men this
week, Lieutenant A. W. Farmer,

ROTC Students

Continued from page one
of the men during outdoor drill pe-
riods was slovenly and ragged When
they were dressed in civilian
clothes. The new ruling is expect-
ed to make the class drills, all held
outdoors during the spring and fall
months, more nearly approach the
regular conditions under which sol-
diers must drill.

Juniors in the corps and band
members were declared by their

fellows to be the most fortunate uri-

der the set-up, for they are the only
ones who have the new style shawl
collar uniforms. Freshman, soph-
omores, and seniors in the corps
wear uniforms with the high choker
collars.

puislicity officer of the Pittsburgh
recruiting office, in listing the qual-
iﬁcations for enlistment, pointed
out that the candidate must have
completed at least two years of
college. giving the student half the
number of credits necessary for
graduation.

Men who have completed their
college education and have a de-
gree in any branch of engineering
will be able to take the course of-
fered by the Air Corps to become
an aeronautical engineer at New
York university or Purdue.

Lieutenant Farmer pointed out

course, and the Army Air Corps
ﬂying schools are maintained at
Government. expense with the stu-
dent being paid a salary while
learning.

Entrance Qualiﬁcations

married male citizen of the United
States between the ages of 20 and
26 years. Not having two years
of college, the applicant must take
a written examination which is
