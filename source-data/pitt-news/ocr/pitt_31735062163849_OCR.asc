BRIAN GENERALOVICH and McCoy Mclemore. Drake

sfar, are counted upon in femor-

row's game between Piff and Drake in the first round of the NH’.

By ART FLEISCHNER
NEW YORK —- The only thing favoring the Panther_ basketball
team tomorrow when they play Drake in the opening round of the

NIT at Madison Square Garden is that the Bulldogs don’t know any-

more about Pitt than Pitt knows about Drake. I
Panther coach Bob Timmons admits that he knows very little
about the opposition but takes consolence in the fact that Drake is
in the same position. Local fans can see which team knows the most
tomorrow at 4 p.m. when WIIC, Channel 11, televises the game.

What Timmons does know is that Drake has a 6-foot-10 center
that will present a problem. He does not, however, plan to do any-
thing drastic but to ask Paul Krieger _to do the best he can.

Krieger is undoubtedly the key to tomorrow’s game. If he can
rebound and score the wayhe has done in spurts this year, then the
Panther cause will be aided immeasurably. If, however, he gets into
foul trouble as is his custom, then the odds are that Pitt's debut in
the NIT won’t be too successful.

The object of Krieger’s attention will be Larry Prins. Prins
is the only one on the starting team who is not averaging in
double ﬁgures, but the Drake attack revolves around him.

The Bulldogs like to bring the ball down court slowly and set
up a play. Prins is often the man who sets the pick or who gives
the pass for the score. Both he and Krieger must play well if their
teams are to win.

Drake coach Maurice John often uses 6-foot-6 Dave Hansen to
spell Prins. Hansen, like Prins is averaging ﬁve points per game.
Both centers are about equal in ability, but because Prins is four
inches taller, he usually gets the starting position.

Drake’s forwards, 6-foot-6 McCoy McLemore and 6-foot-5
Gene Bogash seem to be on a par with -the Panthers’ Brian

Jesse Stuart Speaks
Today at 19th Annual

Writers’ Conference

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS
Jesse Stuart, literary herald for Appalachia, is one of a cast
of writing celebrities speaking at the 19th Annualtconference for
Readers and Writers today in the Stephen Foster Memorial. A four-
member panel —- Fred Maguire, Marie Torre, Milton Lehman, and

\‘-" Stuart -—- aired “Advice to a Young Writer” this morning.

‘-

D

Stuart will draw from his abundant experiences to present “For
the Writer" at 2 p.m. His talk will follow Maguire’s “To Conceal
or to Reveal,” a lecture on selecting effective details, beginning at
1 p.m. ‘

Stuart’s talk, according to Edwin L. Peterson, professor of Eng-
lish, should be an excellent one. Peterson maintains a rambling cor-
respondence with Stuart and recalls an incident which demonstrates
the writer’s speaking talent. “I was teaching a short story class . . .
I followed their gaze . . . and there in the doorway stood a huge
man. Pretty soon he took over the conversation and no one moved
for two hours.”

Stuart relates a similar incident in his autobiographical novel
The Thread That Runs So True. At a small college “classes were
postponed and bells rang until I had spoken.” Professor Peterson
credits Stuart’s interesting style to “a robust guy telling a natural
story . . not caring for techniques except the instinctive
technique.”

In The Thread, Stuart expresses this philosophy in his quest to
improve education. “I wanted to know everything about American
schools . . . to heap the information up —— like cords of wood and
’throw out the bad and accept the sound and durable. Our pupils

were like young crowded trees growing in a vast forest —— very much
alike."

Stuart recognized the faults of a large stratified educational sys-
tem and verbally and physically defended his cause. In the course
of his active protests he was rocked. shot, run out of town and black-
jacked by the authoritarians he deﬁed: A

He lashed out: a

“O hypocritical, shortsighted -—- politicians, perpetrators of
continued ignorance, I at least shall go on record to rebuke you!

-—- We educate our people or we perish . . .” I

“I don’t know 01:’ any profession that is more important — but I'm
leaving it because its left me. I’m going to raise sheep and farm
and write.” And he does. V

Actor Carnovsky Casts Trance

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

Shakespearean actor M o r r i s
Carnovsky cast an absolute trance
over his Midday Series audience
Wednesday when he gave a dra-
matic recital of lines‘ from “King
Lear” at the close of his speech
on “An Actor Works on King
Lear.”

Carnovsky, whose appearance is
nondescript except during his dra-
matic bits, summoned his powers
to maximum impact as he held his
audience rapt in his palm with his
reading from Lear. The actor
played Lear throughout last sum-
mer at Stratford, Connecticut, and
well lived up to his billing by
Walter Kcrr as “the best Lear I
have seen."

His dramatic climax was reach-
cd by Carnovsky after his de-
scription of the rigors of the actor
in trying to feel the character of
Lcar.

“'l‘he actor throws out bits of
script, then picks out the good
ones — he says: ‘Yeah, yeah!’ —
and he comesito rehearsal with
a little bit of new enlightenment.
feeling his face is clean and that
some meat is ﬁnally holding the
dry bones together.

By AL J ANEZIC

Whether a student with a 2.25
QPA can handle, the office of sec-
retary or treasurer was the major
concern at the Men’s Dorm Coun-
cil meeting Wednesday evening in

I Schenley-Hall.

The discussion occurred before
voting on an amendment stating,
in part, that a 2.5 QPA was the
minimum requirement for the

4’ offices. The Council was not as-
sured enough qualiﬁed candidates
under the 275' stipulation, and the

_ suggestion was put forth that if
the quality point average was
lowered to 2.25 otherwise ineligi-
ble Council members would be

_ valid nominees. '

 

  

’Pros and cons were discussed
and ﬁnally acting president Dave
Higbee called for a vote on the 2.5

, requirement which the Council de-

“ feated 8-7. A motion was then
made that the 2.25 proposal be
voted on at the next meeting. If
passed, the otﬁcers will be elected
at that time.

Parking Problem

-Higbee asked for comments on
the planned weekend banning of
parking in the quadrangle from

_ 7:30 to 9:30 and 1 to 1:30 on Fri-
7 1 day and Saturday nights. Council
_ pointed out that the system adopt-
7, ed by Capt. Charles Ray of the
' University police was not solving
4 ‘the parking problem but was only
shifting the problem to another
area. At the suggestion of Sim-

  

 

QPA Requirements
 Discussed by MDC

mund Norr, Council decided to
send Ray a letter of recommenda-
tion not to go through with the
tentative trial run scheduled for
the March 20 weekend.

Pete ‘Baer reported that the
newly-formed MDC committee
to investigate house party policy
has put forth the following sug-
gestions: that house parties be
extended to 1 a.m.; persons at-
tending be allowed in the lounge
area during the entire party,
and that doors be open one foot.
The committee is trying to get
a written /“statement outlining
an explicit University policy on
house parties.

In other business,- Hawthorne
House and Winbrook House are
running one-two in the competi-

tion for best gener-al dorm conduct
for the year. The listings show

Hawthorne with 500 points and‘

Winbrook with 405. Ratings in-
clude house parties and athletic

events, but exclude both basket-

ball and QPA.

Complaints were brought to the
ﬂoor about the need for more
dryers for the laundry room in the
Towers. Norr noted that 10 addi-
tional dryers are on order, but
their time of arrivalgis unknown.

The possibility of a more com-
prehensive campus post office was
proposed, adding a scale to weigh
packages and window to buy
stamps. Its feasibility is being in-
vestigated.

A Three Frats Gain
' Scholarship Prize
For Best QPA’s

A Interfraternity Council has an-
, nounced the chapter winning
‘_‘_._, ~ scholarship awards for last term.
 Sigma Alpha Epsilon had
achieved the highest chapter
average of 2.458. Following SAE
was Pi Lambda Phi with an over-
0 all active and pledge quality point
average of 2.449, and Theta Chi
with 2.418.

 

 

The greatest improvement in
chapter average was made by
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, with an in-
crease of .345 quality points. Sec-
ond was Delta Tau Delta, .299;
‘ and third, Kappa Theta, .176, and
honorable mention, Phi Gamma
Delta, .165.

The pledge class of Pi Lambda
Phi had the highest pledge class
average, 2.379. The class of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon achieved the sec-
ond highest QPA, 2.326; Phi Kap-
pa Theta, the third highest, 2.302.

Nine of the 12 fraternities

'~  ranked improved their QPA sub-
‘ stantially. Parker Enwright, IFC
advisor, sees this improvement as
a reﬂection of a more serious at-

titude toward scholarship among
the Greeks, as well as a rise in
over-all University standards.

stumbles upon meanings. Then

evolves. Everything from that
point you do as the character,”
he continued.

Carnovsky described his feel-
ings for the role of Lear: “In King
Lear, you have man and fate in
ultimate confrontation; a challenge
between man and the gods, or na-
ture or fate, whichever you want.
Man is momentarily on the same
level as God.”

Carnovsky oﬂered a novel idea
of Lear’s motivation in splitting up
his kingdom. He said, “There are
indications that Lear had some-
thing in mind in dividing his king-
dom. It is my contention that Lear
had determined to make the ‘ﬁnal
test’.”

Carnovsky and his director
had agreed, “It (the role of
Lear) is impossible.” But they
also agreed to do‘ it. “We’ll go
for broke.” Carnovsky added,
“It was a tragic prospect; the

 

Rush Forms
Due Today i

In announcing that. rush »ap-
plications will terminate today,
Interfraternity Council President
Norm Himes speculated, at the
Tuesday meeting of IFC, that
next fall’s rush could be the
largest since the Greek system
began here.

During the discussion of the
coming rush, Freshman Camp was
sighted as an aid to both the
Greeks and the incoming stu-
dents. This year’s camp will start
with the beginning of the fall
trimester, not one‘, week before
as in the past.

The annual travel -scholarship
award, known as the “S” award,
received strong support from. the
Council. The award, given to a
junior with a‘minimum 2.0. QPA,’
offers the student the chance to
study abroad.

The ego ‘in andactor will not

TitleToday

By FRANK SMIZIK

LANCASTER, Pa. _ The 60th
annual Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Association tournament
gets underway here this afternoon
at Franklin and Marshall College
with ‘the Panthers listed, along
with Syracuse, as the pre-tourney
favorites.

Coach Rex Peery said that Syra-
cuse is the team to beat. “They
have four fellows who could all
win individual titles and that
makes them tough,” Peery said.
He was referring to Syracuse’s
123-pounder Terry Haise, 157-
pounder Dick Slutzky, 177-pound»
er Lew Roberts and heavyweight
Jim Nance. ,

Peery will start the same
lineup he used to defeat Lehigh,
which consists of from 123-_
pounds to heavyweight, respec-'
tively, Tom Heniﬁ, Mike John-
son, Frank iO’Korn, Dino Boni,
Tom Bailey, Lee Hall, Ken
Barr, Bill Beck and Bill Bodle.

Johnson, Hall, Barr and O’Korn
are the Panthers with best chances
to win individual titles, although
only‘ Johnson was seeded ﬁrst by
the’ tournament‘ committee. His
main competition should come
from Bill Stuart of Lehigh, who
he defeated, 7-2, during the reg-
ular season. '

_Hall will_be underdog to top-
Marty Strayer of Penn
State. Strayer ﬁnishedrsecond to
Pitt’s Jim Harrison last season and
wasundefeated this year, as was
Hall. Navy’s Dave Carey will also
be competition for Hall and Stray-
er.

Barr must oust defending
champion‘ Gerry. Franzen of
Navy if he is to win the title.
Barr was pinned by Franzen in
overtime in ‘last year’s ﬁnal,
after leading for most of the
match. He later beat Franzen at
the National championships.

O’Korn faces the toughest com-
petition of all the Panthers. Un-
beaten Wayne Hicks of Navy is
the favorite in ‘this talent-loaded
class, but Army’s Ed Winborn and
Syracuse’s- Jim Murrin are also
strong contenders along with
O’Korn. 0 '

Heniff, Baily and Boni all could
place for the Panthers, but have
little chance of winning. It is
doubtful if either Beck or Bodle
will get past the ﬁrst round.

Timmons will probably ask Sauer to watch McLemore and Gen-

If the Panthers rebound against Drake the way they did against
Temple, a team which lost to Drake, 58--54, then they might surprise
the experts‘ who made them the underdog. ‘

For most of this season the Panther guards have been superior
to their opposition. Starting guards Dave Roman and Cal Sheffield

Szykowny and Tim Grgurich are the main

have to use all four in .tomorrow’s game.

Drake’s starting guards are 6-foot-1 Billy Foster and 6-‘foot-‘4
Gene West. Foster is averaging 14 points per game and is- the
team’s playmaker. West is averaging 10 points per game.
As neither coach has much knowledge about the other team, perhaps
the “up” factor will determine who will play New Mexico Tues. night.

This is deﬁnitely the year for miscarriages of justice.
First it was our beloved Panthers and their 9-1 record. Then
it was the failure of Paddy Chayefsky’s play, “The Passion
of Joseph D” to set Broadway afire. And now comes the law
of the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, which handed seven Oscar nominations to “Hud”
and then turned right around and failed to nominate the ﬁlm

  UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

  AN X‘iE'iZ°. DININEEETITSITY
PASSOVEB SEIIE

for best picture of the year.

As expected and predicted by‘ yours truly a few weeks
ago, the majority of nominationsé

were received by “Tom Jones,”
“Cleopatra,” and “81/4.” “How the
West Was Won” received eight
nominations, among which are for
the best ﬁlm of the year, and yet
there wasn_’t a single nomination
for either acting, direction, or
writing, which are the major
facets of a motion picture. Of the
Cleo; nominees, only Julius Caesar
garnered an acting nod in the ma-
jor categories.

I hope that what I have to
say doesn’t sound like sour
grapes. I'm just trying to point
out the workings of 2,400 adult
individuals and the peculiar
psychology behind their actions
involving “Hud.” Here is a film,
voted as the runnerup film of
the year in the New York and
Los Angeles Film Critics’ year-
end poll, and recipient of seven,
mind you, that's seven nomina-
tions and no best film nod.

Among its top laurels are Paul
Newman as best actor, Melvyn
Douglas as best supporting actor,
Pat Neal as best actress, Martin
Ritt as best director, Irving Rav-
etch and Harriet Frank as best
scenarists, and James Wong Howe
as best photographer: If these
nominations don’t add up to a best
picture nomination, then I have
used the word “nomination” too
much. -

Apparently, the members of the
Academy. try to pass the buck in
a circumstance such as this one.
They seem to think that the other
fello_w will vote for the film, in
this case Hud, and so they just
vote for the individual categor-
ies and then they give Lilies of
the Field or America, America

their vote for the best picture of

the year.

You would think that by
now the ﬁlm makers would have
learned their lesson but they
haven't. And through the night
of April 13, the millions of peo-
ple watching the affair on tele-
vision will hear" the name Hud
numerous times and I hope they

“will wonder as I did why this

ﬁne ﬁlm failed to receive its
rightful nomination as best film
of the year.

After promoting Gene Lindacher (BA 1957) u
_ . _ ' -9 P the
ladder from Traﬁic Assistant in Ridgewood to Traﬂic Mana”.
ger for the Paterson District, New Jersey Bell handed him
anew challenge.’ They named him Plant Service Super-
visor for Repair in the 43,000-customer Dover area.
This meant that after managing operators and their
supervisors (all women), he was suddenly put in charge
V of a highly -technical group of repairmen and other tele-
phone technicians.

Genes increased responsibilities came about because

of his. outstanding performance in Trafﬁc Department.
Knowing that good managers can step into new situations
easily, New Jersey Bell did not hesitate to move Gene into
the more technical Dover job. '

New Jersey Bell considers Gene a versatile young mana-
ger with an unlimited future. Not a bad reputation to have!

Gen? Lindachefs like many young men, is impatient to
make things happen for his ‘company and himself.» There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
