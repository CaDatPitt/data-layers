Families, high schoolers drawn to Bigelow Bash 2.0

Milton Eldridge
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Bigelow Bash attracted people of
all ages with its bands, carnival rides
and food.

People ﬂooded the stretch of Big-
elow Boulevard between Fifth and
Forbes avenues yesterday for the live
performance by]ack’s Mannequin.

“I came back on campus today to
hear them play,” Pitt alumnus Matt
Keltz said. “I’ve been to the previous
bashes, and this is one of the best.”

Caitlyn Depp and Mike Cupo, who
arehigh school seniors ofMt. Lebanon
High School, rode The Hurricane, a
ride that spins its passengers around
in mir1i—cars that seat four, twice.

“I can’t feel my sides,” Depp said

with a_ giggle. Her boyfriend, Cupo,

saidzhe discovered the carnival one

dayilvhile driving down Fifth Avenue
and decided it would make a perfect

date. They rode the miniature Ferris .

wheel, The Expo Wheel, next.
The camivalattracted children and
parents aswell. ' . ’
“It’s good publicity for the school,”
sophomore Peter Miller said. “It at-
tracts parents and allows them to see

the school. This year’s Bash was deﬁ- .

nitely better.” ‘

Pitt students could pay $5 for an
all-day passor $2 for individual ride
passes. Non-Pitt students could pay
$10 for an all-day pass or $4 for an in-
dividual ride. ‘

Center offers help for those distracted by sun

Maura Natale

For The Pitt News <

When the sun peeks out in early spring,
students predictably make their ways to
the small patches of grass near campus,
toting towels and ﬂip—flops. L

The ones who don’t make it to the lawn
are often sitting in class thinking about
sunbathing.

“Seventy—f1ve and sunny on Soldiers

and Sailors is the conscientious student’s
kryptonite,” Pitt student Chris Yakscoe
said.

Charie Daviston, a coordinator in Pitt’s
Academic Resource Center, said students
often lack motivation when they return
from spring break. '

Daviston and the staff at the center
train peer tutors to facilitate workshops
designed to help students channel their
inner Superman. Workshops in March

focused on time management and avoid-

-_ing procrastination, as well as staying

motivated while studying.

Students learn several key skills at
workshops, suchas deciding on a clear—cut
goal for themselves. Studying chemistry
two hours per week serves as a good ex-

. ample. Goals enable students ‘to balance

work with play, because, as Pitt ‘student
Eileen Chan said, “The weather outside is
just too nice to want to sit inside and

study.”

Yakscoe has to fool himself to study.

“A good trick is to close your blinds.
in your room to trick yourself about the
weather,” he said.

Annie Plunkett, another Pitt student,
said she sometimes goes home for the
weekend to finish her work. “I know my
mom will force me to,” she said. ,

Yakscoe and Plunkett are doing exactly
what tutors at the center are teaching their

' ‘ students to do, which is getting rid of po-

tential distractions. _ .

Students need to separate their study
time and their television time, as well as
make sure they eat healthyfoods and sleep
between six and eight hours every night,

' _ Daviston said.

Perhaps this is why the Academic Re-
source Center urges students to consider
why they’re studying in the first place.
When students specify‘ a cause for study-
ing, the tutors at the center can “give them
the kind of pep talk that they need,” Da-
viston said. ' _ A

Workshop facilitators frown upon pro-
crastination, but different study» habits
work for different people.

“I getimy papers out of the way, and

, then I have one less thing to worry about,”

Pitt studentjen Bebey said.

The Academic Resource Center offers.

Pitt students Final Exam Preparation
Workshops to help keep students on track
before finals. - 3
Workshops are offered three times a
week. Daviston said most of the students
who attend the‘ workshops are freshmen
and sophomores even though students of
all levels and majors can attend. More than

half of the students who use the services-

are repeating participants.
Students continue to populate Schen-

ley Plaza, donning sunglasses and shiny

wristbands they have yet to take off af-
ter trips to Cancun and Panama City, Fla.
That’s fin_e, but like Daviston stresses,
remember why you’re here at Pitt, and
use your resources.

Centeron the following days:

Root beer pong caps off relay event

Relay 4 1

walked through to take the ﬁrst lap of the
night. Then, for the next 15 hours, Pitt
students walked along the track on the
Cathedral lawn.

Despite the pain cancer has caused so
many people, the atmosphere on Friday
night was anything but depressing. Stu-
dents said they were having a great time.
They held root beer pong tournaments
and dance competitions, blared music and
ate plenty of food, in addition to walking
in the relay. .

The track, which was surrounded by
tents holding each of the teams, looked

. more crowded than a Fifth Avenue sidewalk

on a Monday afternoon. At least one person
from each of the 82 teams had to be walk-
ing at all times during the 15-hour event.
Allison Quinn, the chair for Pitt’s Relay
for Life, said participants do this because
cancer patients cannot just walk away their
disease which never sleeps.

Quinn, a Pitt senior, said the relay
doubled in size from last year, attract-
ing 82 teams this year. Most teams were
comprised of campus organizations, such
as Greek organizations, community ser-
vice groups and dormitory ﬂoors. Some
groups of friends came out for the event
and formed their own teams.

Quinn ﬁrst participated in Relay For
Life at Pitt three years ago, when it was
new to campus. That ﬁrst experience with
Relay For Life inspired her to become more
involved with the organization.

“I remember thinking this had the
potential to be a really great event,” she
said.

With only ﬁve or six people on the com-
mittee in its ﬁrst year, the relay committee
has grown to include more than 45 people.
Quinn said not many people got involved in
the first Relay For Life, because few people
knew about it.

That ﬁrst year, the relay raised $15,000
with about 15 teams, Quinn said. Last year,
the total rose to $45,000, and the commit-
tee set the goal for this year at $55,000,

she said. As of the night before Relay, they

had raised $48,000.

According to the relay’s website, 874
participants signed up online this year. The
organization raised about $69,000 this

year, passing the original goal by $14,000, i
said Jade Holtzinger, the co-chair for the

€V€I’lt.

Much of the money raised this year’,

came from the event Friday night. Vari-

ous fundraisers took place all over the
Cathedral lawn, including a Miss Relay ‘

contest — male students dressed in drag

and walked around Oakland to try and"
.raise money. -

Luminaria bags —— white paper bags _
with a candle on the inside _— lined the.

sides of the track. Participants wrote the
names of people who had battled cancer on
the outside of each bag. The bags drew in
many of the donations for the event.

Quinn said she thinks the event has
grown because it tries to ﬁnd a cure for a
disease that has affected the lives of mil-
lions of people. Holtzinger spoke about
the effects cancer can have on the people
close to its victims.

Holtzinger, a junior, lost her mother to
pancreatic cancer last school year.

“She was my best friend and my only
family,” Holtzinger said. “But I didn’t just
want to cry and feel sorry for myself for
losing her. I wanted to make something
positive out of my bad experience.”

EDITORIAL

Safety in technical

degrees

tudents go to college to get an
education. It is expected that

completion of that education
will make a student more competi-
tive and competent in pursuit of
employment within her given ﬁeld.
It follows that competitive employ-
ment usually means a competitive
salary.

‘ Expectations in salary should
see a slight drop this year com-
pared to last. 2010 bache1or’s de-
gree graduates will see a 1.7 per-
cent drop in average salary, from
$48,515 to $47,673, according to
the National Association of Colleges
and Employers.

This general trend is not new to
the public. But: then again, neither
is going to college.

The act of enrolling in college,
speciﬁcally, colleges that offer lib-
eral arts education-, seems to be

the product of a social norm. It’s

the next step in the series of the
learningyears. For many, it’s just the
thing to do after high school, and
maybe it’s this unquestioning ap-
proach that leads to lower success
later in life, if success is measured
by salary.

Some deep thought about why
one wants to go to college might
change the decision she would
have normally made out of pres-
sure from our society, because it’s
just the thing to do. It is possible
that not going to college is better
than having a degree and being in
debt without ﬁnding a job with a
decent salary.

The alternative to a liberal arts
education is a technical education,
like that offered in a community col-
lege. Community college can have

a negative stigma in the liberal arts
culture, but might just win when it’s

time to apply for a job.

What’s more, it’s usually much
cheaper —— and nowa college in
Michigan is making the deal even
sweeter. j

Lansing Community College in
Michigan is guaranteeing students
a job within a year of graduation or
they will be reﬁmded their tuition

money, according to Time maga- ,

zine. The deal applies to students
taking six-week courses on track
of becoming call-center special-
ists, pharmacy technicians, quality
inspectors and computer machin-
ists. -

_ Sure, the deal is limited inscope,
but it is still a guarantee. Likewise,
students entering the deal are ex-
pected to be competitive and elite.

This deal highlights where
the focus of community college
is: students attend college to get
trained for a certain job. That cer-
tain job contrasts how liberal arts
education, while offering different
advantages, affords a degree of
uncertainty in what job a student
might have.

The issue is not that technical
education is better or worse than a
liberal arts education. What is more
important is what the student ex-
pects out of it.

In the middle of recession, it
is time to become a responsible
student, realize the hard statistics
and evaluate goals. It is not time
to take a liberal arts education for
granted, but to enter it with respect
for degree—completion rates and job
prospects in any chosen ﬁeld. L

In the article,.the representative

to“throwoutyouropinion ofthe pas ”

This, it seems, is hardly necessary, as

the PPC Bigelow Bashis ashoddy and
underdeveloped imitation of Carnegie
Mellon’s highly anticipated carnival.

PPC seems to think that adding a
fewbrightly colored rides and popcorn
willdistractthe everydaystudentfnom
the outdated and artistically question-
able bands that it books for its large
events every year.

What PPC should do, if it really
wants to create an event that holds
the respect and anticipation that the

CMU carnival possesses, is to take a
hint from Carnegie Mellon’s program
council andbringmusical actsthatare
critically acclaimed. '

Thereis alarge dilference between
bringing the Black Keys, the Roots
and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and
bringingJack’s Mannequin — a band
whose relevance has always been in
question, even when the band was re-
motely fresh three years ago — and
Cute Is What We Aim For — a band
whose primary audience is still com-
pleting junior high.

What PPC should do is ask and
actually take the advice of organiza-
tions that make music, arts and cul-

~ ture a primary focus, like WPTS-FM,

The Original Magazine and Electronic
Musicians Club.
WPTS was involved with the only

concert of merit that PPC has brought
since my enrolment — Kid Cudi —
and cosponsored the Hip—Hop Battle
that determined the openers for that
event.

Some of my fondestmemories of el-
ementary and middle school involve
baseball. Whether it was lying on the
rug at home listeningto Chicago Cubs
games on the radio, starting with the
sports page when I read the newspa-
per or playing third base for my Little
League team, baseball was not just a
game —- itwas the game.

I lived, breathed and enjoyed the
crack of the bat, the bellow of the um-
pire and the box scores.

Amongmy friends who played soc-
cer and basketball exclusively, Iwas a
weird kid. Granted, I was aweird kid

However, my soccer-playing

Guitarist Rocky Votolato used to perform in punk rock bands until he
made a transition to folk music.

\ Larissa Gula
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Guitarist Rocky Votolato has al-
ways felt that he belonged in the
folk music scene.

Even when he performed as the
guitarist for punk rock bands like
Waxwing, he wrote acoustic songs
on the side for himself. Votolato
described the composition as an
unconscious process.

“I. played in a bunch of punk
bands, but on the side, I was always
writing country-sounding songs,”
Votolato said. “I was always writing
on the acoustic guitar. My mom
bought an acoustic guitar from a
pawn shop, and that was always
the guitar I was writing songs on
in my bedroom.”

In 2003, Votolato emerged as .

a solo artist with songs that com-
bined his life and ﬁctional aspects.
He has used this songwriting style
ever since while slowly gaining sup-
port. ‘ ,

The singer prefers to perform

Voolat rocks quietly, lives hap

in small venues, often participat-

ing in charity shows. Ten percent
of the royalties from tomorrow’s
show will go to One Day .Founda-
tion’s wages to help ﬁght extreme
global poverty. Votolato said he
does not consider himself a large-
scale, famous singer. '

“I’ve always been kind of under
the radar with my career,” he said.
“I do good in a lot of places in the
country, but I started out kind of
subtle and it was a slow climb.”

Votolato stayed positive’ and

4 always had help from asupport

system of friends, family, fans and
reliable music labels. His name is

known in the U.S., Canada and Eu-
rope.

Even though his name has gone
international, he still holds to one
of the values of folk song writing
— closeness.» V

“It’s still at a level that it’s very
intimate,” Votolato said about his
music. “Most of my shows are from
200 to 500 people. I like that right
now. I’m happy with it. If it contin-
ues to grow, I’ll try to do two nights
in each city since I like small ven-
ues. It’s just me and my guitar.”

Votolato said he also loves the
“sense of community” he creates
with his music.

“The communication at shows,
having a group of people there to
experience art and take away some-
thing meaningful” is his favorite
part of the shows, Votolato said.

“That’s what drew me in origi-

nally,” he said. “It has the ability.

to change people’s lives, hopeﬁilly

__ for the better.”

He said his own life has taken
extremely fortunate turns.” He

MOVIE COLUMN

Movie cult classics need not be masterpieces

‘Troll 2’ feigns sequel status to film classic ‘Troll.’

Andy 'I‘ybout
Columnist

Only about once per year does a-ﬁlm
manage to attain “masterpiece” sta-
tus. But don’t fret, ﬁlmmakers. Your
movie doesn’t have to be brilliant
— or even good —- to live forever
as a cult classic.

It’s come to my attention, for in-
stance, that the increasingly popular
cult classic and supposed worst mov-
ie of all time, “Troll 2” (1990) is now
the subject of a documentary: the
aptly titled “Best Worst Movie.”

Having the opportunity — or
misfortune ——- of seeing much of the
movie it proﬁles, I can only applaud
this pursuit. Not only will this be a
great lesson in how not to make a
ﬁlm, but it will offer a much—needed
examination in how ﬁlms gain a fol-
lowing.

A bit of background: “Troll 2” is,
believe it or not, not a sequel and in
no way connected to the 1986 ﬁlm
“Troll.”

Rather, the ﬁlmmakers named
it such because they wanted to pig-
gyback off “Troll’s” box oﬂice suc-
cess. In fact, there aren’t any trolls

in “Troll 2.” Sounds good already,
right?

Nilbog, which, much to their dismay,

"doubles as a haven for goblins —

Not only will this be a great lesson
in _how not to make a film, but it will
offer a much—needed examination in
how films gain a following. i

Well, here’s the plot: In “Troll 2,”
a chronically stupid family takes a

or, as any half—blind audience can
clearly see, a bunch of short people

trip out to the farming community of wearing masks.

‘ Rather than just killing intruders, ,

the goblins attempt, in a variety of
convoluted ways, to force humans
to ingest some sort of green goo,
which will apparently make them
more edible.

In a just world, the aforemen-
tioned description alone would
damn this movie into obscurity. _

But in the idiosyncratic circle
of B movie buffs, “Troll 2” has,.like
many of its contemporaries, become
a veritable cult classic — which,‘ in a
way, makes sense. ,

Generally, three types of ﬁlms
morph into cult classics: movies

MUSIC REVIEW

Sweet approach,
sticky territory  

Madonna ’s tour album makes listeners wish for the real

thing.

Kieran Layton
A 8' E Editor

In general, concert albums tend to provide a
paradox illustrated by the name of Madonna’s
2008 world tour.

On one hand, it’s sweet that artists offer
fans a chance to (sort of) experience their
live shows if exorbitant ticket prices or oth-

er conﬂicts prevent fans from attending the
concert.
It’s a sticky situation, however, because it

also gives fans ‘the feeling of how much they L ‘

missed.

Madonna’s 52!z'a@: (Y) S 12/eel Tour, her third,

live album, gives fans of her Madgesty both
ends of the spectrum, though it’s an overall
positive listening experience. Even though I
wasn’t at the concert, it was fun imagining
the Queen of Pop putting on an expectedly
excellent show as she performs her hits, both
old and new.

Opening ‘with “Candy Shop,” a delicious
slice of electro pop from Madonna’s last studio
album, Ham’ Camjr, the album never lets up

t
u

its rapid-ﬁre pacing — much like the concert
experience itself. '

Classics such as “Hurnan Nature” and
“Vogue” receive the revamping treatment
that make them sound like they would be more
at home on a Lady Gaga album than the ’90s
hits they really are. ’

Still, it’s the tracks from Ham’ Camp: that
prove how talented the icon really is. Coming
from an album that represented Madonna’s
ability to adapt and shift her musical style
to ﬁt changing trends, “She’s Not Me” and
“Spanish Lessons” are two high notes on the
album.

“Devil Wouldn’t Recognize You” sees the

energy take a harsh dip, but overall, it’s bal— _

anced out by “Beat Goes on Medley” (with a
Kanye West appearance), and the smash hit “4
Minutes.” No,Justin Timberlake and Timba—
land don’t actually appear in the concert, but
it’s impossible not to feel their presence.

Finally, “Like a Prayer 2008,” another re-
worked classic, ends the album on a nostalgic
yet optimistic note — even in the age of Gaga
and Britney Spears, it’s clear that Madonna
still knows how to please her adoring audi-
ence. ’ s _ A

TELEVISION REVIEW

‘Lost’ writers seem lost this season

Kieran Layton
A Er E Editor

So, we are 11 episodes into the last
season of one of the greatest cultural
events to happen to television in our
lifetime. That means there are only
six episodes 'of “Lost” left, and with
so little time to go until it’s all over,
I‘_can’t help but say I’m disappointed
— and conﬁised — with the -sixth
season.

In a series that has piled mythol-
ogy on top of mystery, sprinldedwith
a huge ensemble cast and exotic is-
land locales for six years now, it isn’t
unreasonable to expect at least some
of the loose ends to be tied up before
the ﬁnale — ‘a. two-hour epic event

i slated to‘ air on Sunday, May 23.

The creators are running out of

time, however, and it’s my unfor- '

tunate opinion that this season has
been the most patience-testing exer-
cise in devotionl have ever endured.
Not only have few questions been
answered —- instead, new ones are
continuously raised—— butthe gener-

al quality of what was once can’t-miss
television has been reduced to small
moments in an episode that makes
you say, “Yeah, that was almost as

good as what ‘Lost’ used to be.”

Quite simply, the show is becom-
ing increasingly harder to continue
to love.

In the aftermath of last season’s
(literally) explosive ﬁnale, our ragtag
group of plane crash survivors ﬁnd

' themselves in the present — ﬁnally

—— with a lot to deal with. There’s
the Man in Black (assuming the
body of deceased John Locke) and
his tendency to turn into the Smoke
Monster and kill people. There’s the
group of temple-dwelling followers
of Jacob, who disappear almost as
soon as they are introduced, offer-

ing no explanation to why they are ‘

on the island.
And then there’s Claire, making
a reappearance two seasons in the

making, who looks seriously in need '

of a hair stylist.
To say that there has been little
plot progression this season would

be a lie: Viewers have learned a lot '

about Jacob and the Man in Black,
what their mission is for the island
and, as of last Tuesday’s Desmond-
centric episode “Happily Ever After,”
we have gained insight into the im-
portance of the gratingly armoying

9

' ﬂash—sideways plot device.

Now, I have faith that my ques-
tions will be answered — there’s too
much pressure on the creators for
them not to enlighten people. Whatl
take issue with, however, is the severe

' decline in quality this season has ex-

perienced, almost increasingly with

with gratuitous sex and violence (“Pulp Fic-

trump many classics in longevity (“Plan 9 from

My ﬁrst guess was simple enjoyability. Whe ’

giggle inducing from beginning to end. -

they are, in some bizarre way, original.

inﬁnite list of ﬂaws, has a premise you would _

have to be on allkinds of narcotics to dream

Pitttakes series from No. 7 Louisville

After winning the fl’l’Sl 2 games against the Cardinals, Pitt blows ninth-inning lead in the 3rd game.

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

A ninth—inning rally yesterday pre-
vented the Pitt baseball team from
claiming a weekend sweep of No.
7 Louisville. Instead, the Panthers
tied for fourth in the conference.
Pitt beat the Cardinals 8-3 on

Friday and 15-5 on Saturday but .

dropped the series ﬁnale 9-7.
Much like the series-opening
loss in Pitt’s last three—game set

against Rutgers, the loss came after 7

a ninth-inning rally by the other
team.

Pitt (22-8, 6-3) led the major-
ity of the game and took a 7-5 lead
into the ninth inning, but Louisville
(25-7, 6-3 Big East) put together a
four-run ninth to take the victory.

“Taking two out of three isn’t
the worst thing. It’s real bittersweet
the way they came back, but it’s
tough to sweep anyone in the Big
East,” junior pitcher Corey Baker
said.

“Right now, the way they came
back, we can’t let that affect us,”
Baker said.

Baker picked up the win for the
Panthers in the opening game after
he pitched seven innings, giving
up three earned runs and striking
out ﬁve. '

“I was really doing a good job of
throwing my off-speed pitches for
strikes whenever I got behind in the

count,” Baker said. “I did a good job
keeping the ball down.”

Designated hitter Kevan Smith
and catcher Cory Brownsten each
went 3 for4with two RBIs and one
run scored to provide all the of-
fense the Panthers needed.

In the second game of the se-
ries, Pitt second baseman David
Chester hit a two-run homerun in
the ﬁrst inning, and the Panthers
never looked back on their way to
an impressive 15-5 win.

The homerun by Chester was his .

ﬁrst of two on the day on his way to

a 3 for 5 performance to go along
with four RBIs. Zach Duggan went
4 for 4 with two RBIs.

The offensive output was more
than enough for Pitt pitcher Matt
Iannazzo to work with as he al-
lowed four runs on nine hits in
seven innings to pick up the win
for the Panthers.

“It’s a big relief. It helps you re-
lax as a pitcher,” Iannazzo said of
Pitt’s strong offense in the second
game. “Our offense has luckily been
doing that a bunch this year for a
lot of my starts. You don’t really

ru/n support.”

Despite yesterday’s loss, the
Panthers’ series victory served
notice to the rest of the league that
Pitt is a serious contender.

“It just proves we can play with
anyone. They’re the No. 7 team in
the country, and what we’ve done
so far isn’t a ﬂuke,” Baker said.
“Teams have to beat us, we’re not
going to walk in and let teams run
us over.”

Health Red Wings not underdogs

The Red Wings may have ﬁnished the middle of the pack, but a deep playoff run wouldn’t be surprising.

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Having a low seed in a tournament is usually
abig deal. ‘

If you foresaw that No. 5 seed Butler would
end up in Indianapolis, congratulations. A run
like the Bulldogs’ 25—game win streak doesn’t
happen very often. Who would have thought
they’d be a Gordon Hayward buzzer-beater
away from winning it all?

And I’ll admitl became Canadian forashort
time in 2006 when the No. 8 seed Edmonton
Oilers made the Stanley Cup Finals. I remember
I was the only one in my group of friends that
had them winning even one round.

Low seeds are supposed to be underdogs,
Cinderellas and shockers. But if the “underdog”
Detroit Red Wings show up in six weeks on NBC
playing for their 12th Stanley Cup, I won’t be
surprised in the least.

In the Western Conference, the Red Wings
ﬁnished in the middle of the playoff pack, en-

tering Sunday with a respectable 43-24-14
record.

That record, though, sounds a little more
impressive when you consider the Red Wings
were 27-21-12 and on the playoff bubble on
Feb. 11. The Associated Press’ recap of their
loss to San Jose that night said, “It’s possible
the two teams could meet in the ﬁrst round of
the playoffs with the Sharks as the No. 1 seed
and the Red Wings No. 8.”

And then Detroit won 16 of 21 and, at one
point, threatened the Chicago Blackhawks for
the Central Division title. So much for just a No.
8 seed. The team had a 10-0-2 streak snapped
by Philadelphia last week.

Much of the praise for the turnaround has
been heaped on 26-year-old rookie goalten-

der Jimmy Howard, who took the starting »

job from Stanley Cup-winner Chris Osgood
in January. At one point, Howard started 25
straight games.

His name has been tossed around for the
Calder Trophy for rookie of the year, and ESPN’s
Scott Burnside wrote that his name should be

thrown into the Vezina trophy and MVP mix as
well. That’s going a little too far — Tyler Myers
and Ryan Miller again get my votes for those
— but it shows Howard is a playoff series away
from getting the “savior” treatment.

It’s not just him, though. Detroit’s tum-

showdown.

So what are the Penguins’ chances?

Well, Pittsburgh needs to ﬁgure out how to
beat Washington and Newjersey. The Penguins
went 0-8-2 against the Devils and Capitals
this year. . '

' They don’t have to worry about that -right
away, though. They face Ottawa in the ﬁrst
round, which doesn’t have its typical ﬁrepower.

Dany Heatley is in San Jose now, and Alexei
Kovalev is out for the year with a knee injury.

As far as playoff opponents go, it’s a good draw A

 

 

for the Penguins. -

Then, who knows, maybe some Cinderella
comes along and knocks off the Devils. Before
you know it, we’re looking at another Capitals-
‘Penguins conference-ﬁnals showdown. Crosby,
Evgeni Malkin and Marc—Andre Fleury against
Alex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Alex
Semin. All that good stuff. Six or seven games
later, maybe we are treated to another Red
Wings-Penguins Final.

Though Ovechkin against Detroit would be
fun to watch, too.
