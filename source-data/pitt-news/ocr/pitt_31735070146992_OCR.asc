Candidates
clash in  
fmal debate

\ , ‘Mallory Grbssman
Staff Writer

V The two candidates whoiare vyingforU.S. Sen.

Arlen Specter’s Senate seatidemonstrated dur-
ing a debate on Friday that they diverge on ‘a
number of big policy issues including earmark

spending, natural gas drilling and the contro-
versial American Recovery and Reinvestment

Act, among other issues. A ~ -

Rep._]oe Sestak, the Democratic candidate
who beat incumbent Specter in the Democratic
primary, stressed his concern for the middle
class and the extreme views of his opponent,

Pat Toomey. . ' . - '

V Toomey, the. Republican candidate, talked

A. _ about the federal government’s spending, the
‘ economy and hisyiepncem for his opponent’s
S liberal politics. The debate — the last before

the Nov. 2 election— came days after several
pplls put Toomey and Sestak within the mar-
gin of error, meaning neither candidate has a
strong lead. 4 ‘ ‘ V

Toomey said during the debate that he
not put offby the recent movement in the polls
and said he always knew this was going to be
a close race. '

When asked about the Marcellus Shale , 
, drilling, Toomey saidthat it presents ahuge
f economic oppornmity for Pennsylvania, and,
L over the next 10 years, the development from it
 could generate one quarter of a million jobs.

~ ’ Sestak said that although he is tired of get-

ting oil from overseas, seven counties have‘.

already had their drinking water contaminated
as a result of natural gas drilling.. Q
When Sestal<._w'as- asked about the afford-
ability of highereducation after the debate,
he highlighted part of the health—care reform
bill that gave more money to Pell Grants and
Stafford Loans by cutting out the bank as the
middle man. A ' ._
“Sestak also mentioned the Sunshine Bill,

.. which is currently sitting in the Senate. This’

Actress  
performs
‘I Heart  
Hamas’

Amy Friedenberger
Staﬂ” Writer

Jennifer Jajeh does not consider herself only a
Palestinian. She also identiﬁes as an American,
a single woman, an actress, a Christian, a San
Francisco native and a scotch drinker.

The ﬁlmmaker put that identity to the test
yesterday afternoon in the Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing, where Pitt’s Students forjustice in Palestine
hostedthe one-womanplay “I Heart Hamas: And

1 Other Things I’m Afraid to Tell You.”

Jajeh playedmultiple roles in the hour—and—
a—ha1ftragicomedy. While the ongoing Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict served as a backdrop for
her poignant tale, Jajeh said the main pointvof
herperformancewas to highlight the difficulties
Palestinian—Americans can face in developing a
strong personal identity.’ '

It was a message many in the 1oo—member
audience took to heart. v

.“'Students forjustice in Palestine has always
focused on a more academically driven perspec-
tive, so this was a chance to present the issue in

a more artistic marmer,” saidjonas Moffat, an .

active SJP member. .
‘ During the p1ay,]ajeh, now in her ‘late 20s,
took the audience on an autobiographical jour—

' neyfrom the United States to her parents’ home-

town of Ramallah, located in the West Bank. ' 
She asked the audience to consider the
Israeli—Palestinian conflict from a Palestinian
perspective. - y _

0ak|and’s ghostly hauntsbring fear    

Shae’ Felicien
Staff Writer

Pitt junior Soﬁa Pikalova enjoys scary ghost
stories, especially real ones.

“I think it’s creepy to learn all of the ghost
tales that we have on campus,” Pikalova
said. “Tell me these stories and I get really
creeped out.”

Pikalovajoined about a dozengcommuter
students in Haunted Pittsburgh’s tour of
Oak1and’s most haunted locations Friday
evening. I
She listened intently to guide James

   

“Woody” Cunningham, who related the

ghost story of Henry Clay Frick and other
deceased Pittsburghers said to haunt a num-
ber of locations around town. ,

The jitters many people get while on
haunted tours, or watching horror ﬂicks,
aren’t just for show — they have deep roots
and causes in human physiology.

David Rakison, associate professor of
psychology at CMU, said fear is a univer-
sal experience designed to shield us from
potential dangers. We attain fear through
learned experiences and the negative experi-
ences of others. I ‘

‘prepared’ us to learn some of these fears,
and in particular those threatsthat were
faced by our evolutionary ancestors, such
as snakes, spiders, other humans, heights‘
and open spaces,” Rakison said. '
Unlike Ken»nywood’s Phantom Fright

Nights and some other local haunted houses, ,

the Haunted Oaklandltour did not feature
a series of costume—clad men and women
jumping out to scare guests. Instead, the
evening’s entertainment rested solely upon

. Cunningham’s storytelling. —

As a local historian and close follower of
all things supernatural, Cunningham capti-
vated his audience, often infusing stand-up

comedy into his spirit—ﬁlled stories. .

_ “I do not believe myself to have a creative
bone in my body,” Cunningham said. “I’m
not a good enough liar to make up ghost
stories, so I’m left with the actual ones.”

The tour’s spookylocal stories ranged
from details of a haunted bedroom in the
Early American Nationality Room of Ca-

thedral of Learning, to the attempted as— .
- sassination of Henry Clay Frick, to the “ill

presence” that inhabited one building _on
Ridge Avenue. _ ,

reaches as far back as the ﬁfth g1ade.When her
teacher asked students to .do a group’ project re-
searching the origins of their heritage,]ajehwas

g only Palestinian-American in the class.

jajeh said her play was meant to give a repre-

sentation ofher experience and notthe politically -

correct version that recounts both sides.

Representativesﬁ'omPanthe:rsforlsraeland '

the Pittsburgh Israel Public Affairs Committee
attended the event to represent the Israeli side of
the issue, passing out literature and fliers before
the show. ' '

“Ithoughtitwas abitone—sided,buttl1at’sto , P

Mellitz said. “But it’s her story, so it’s her side.”
Mellitz found the presentation to be slightly

skewed because jajeh’s trip to Ramallah, which

_ _ she recounted duringthe play, occurred duringa ~ g
“' time referred to as the Second Intifada, a period

of intensiﬁed Palestinian-Israeliviolence starﬁng

‘ In one of anumber of emotionalscenes,Jajeh

' President Samanthavinokor, who also attended

the event, said the play was controversial be-
cause Jajeh made generalizations and glossed
over inforrnation; such as the purpose oflsraeli
checkpoints. , g V ’ I‘
“Checkpoints are not a bunch of Israeli sol
diers blocking off dates andfun,” Vinokor said
“The purpose of checkpoints is to cut down on
suicide bombings.” I .

-The Israel Ministry ofForeignAffairs provides .

statistics saying suicide attacks have declined as
aresult of checkpoints. ‘ . « V
A question-and-answer sessionfollowed the

‘ play. One of the issues discussed involved the

plays controversial title, “I Heart Hamas.”

The Council on Foreign Relations deﬁnes
Hamas as “the largest and most inﬂuential Pal-
estinian militant movement’? Its founding charter
calls for the destruction of Israel and the estab-
lishment of an Islamic state. , — _g

A Moffat said that members of Pitt’s Students
forjustice in Palestine do not necessarily share
one single view on the resolution of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, but that they do not associate
themselveswith Hamas. ‘ . .

Jajeh said she does not stand behind the mo-
ﬁves of Hamas, but she wanted the title to serve
as asymbol. , h

“How does someone get so broken down that
they resort to violence?”Jajeh asked. ﬂ

i own with the supernatural. He told listeners

of the time he was violently shaken awake by
an unknown force that left bruises along his
shoulders. He woke to a room ﬁlled with the
Worst smell he has ever experienced.

“I stuck my tongue in the metaphorical
light socket of the supernatural, and it threw
me across the room,” Cunningham said.

Still, Cunningham advised audiences not
to take the stories too seriously. With lines
like “I’ve got a lot of material and not just in
my shirt,” Cunningham attempts to appeal

to the less superstitious by injecting humor
into his tour.

Cunningham has found that fear on his
haunted tours mainly originates from a fear
of the unknown, as assessment shared by
Rakison. .

Rakison likened the fear that develops
on haunted tours or in haunted houses to
the fear people experience when walking
through a new house in the dark.

Rakison said fear produces a series of re-
sponses designed to aid in self—preservation
— such as increased heart rate — that gives

an impression similar to excitement and
even pleasure.

“In the long run, such stress can be bad
for you and, as my colleague Sheldon Cohen
has found, lead to problems with the im-
mune system,” Rakison said. “For one night
though, it’s just some harmless fun.”

Despite his own supernatural experi-
ences, Cunningham continues research in
the ﬁeld.

“There’s something out there,” Cunning-
ham said. “If you could have a master’s de-
gree in spookology, I’d have one.”

“Drunkorexia” proves not

College students are constantly surrounded
by a plethora of unhealthy eating and drink-
ing choices. Leaving school with extra weight
is somewhat expected, considering simply
the food choices of college students, let alone
the amount of binge drinking that commonly
takes place. ’

According to an article in the Los Angeles
Times, campus health educators have recog-
nized a form of disordered eating that they’re
calling “drunkorexia.” A“drunkorexic” person

L sacriﬁces food calories for drink calories by

cutting back on their meals on ‘days they plan
to drink heavily.

“Campus health educators see a spectrum
of disordered eating and drinking, from dieting
and over-exercising in order to party on the
weekends, to medically deﬁnable conditions,”
such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and binge-
eating disorder, The Denver Post reports.

The Pitt News recognizes that there are

medically deﬁnable eating disorders like an-

orexia and bulimia. But the fact that more and

more suggested disorders are being introduced '

shows our society’s need to “medicalize” and
label everything. We feel that “drunkorexia”
is an example of getting carried away with our
desire to categorize.

everything is a disorder

Another example is avoidant-restrictive
food intake disorder — which is essentially a
disorder characterized by extreme picky eat-
ing. In addition, there’s “orthorexia,”vwhich, ac-
cording to Time Magazine, is “a controversial
diagnosis characterized by an obsession with
avoiding foods perceived to be unhealthy.”

We feel that “drunkorexia,” rather than
being a medical condition, is an example of
our country’s tendency to go to unhealthy ex-
tremes. Instead of eating healthily and exercis-
ing on a regular basis, we go on all-juice diets
or completely eliminate food groups such as
carbohydrates. I

Scaling back on calories once a week when .

you plan on drinking is probably not enough
to constitute an eating disorder. But if you’re
doing this several times aweek, you’re probably
not getting enough nutrients, in which case you
could be at risk for an already deﬁned eating
disorder. In" addition, not eating enough food
calories consistently is actually counterpro-
ductive if looking good is your goal —.— you’re
actually harming your metabolism. T

The idea of eating less to drink more brings
up the point that there is a difference between
“looking good” and being healthy. We suggest
you strive for both. I »

Halloween is about more than Wearing a slutty costume

Katie Azzara
Columnist

I’m not sure what it is about college students

and fall, but there seems to be a special con-
nection between the two. As the weather gets

_ colder and our workloads get more strenuous, '

it seems counterintuitive that students would
get excited about the fall. But it’s apparent that

1 they do.

Perhaps it’s the sense of academia that per-
vades the season that makes it so attractive to
students. Or maybe it’s the fact that there is a
certain point at which one simply cannot take

' any more 95-plus degree days. But as we rapidly
_ approach one of the most anticipated party

weekends of the year, I can’t help but suspect
that perhaps Halloween might have something
to do with all the excitement.

Halloween is one of the most thrilling holi-

days for children and adults alike, and espe-’ -

cially for adults in college. Although many of

l‘ the traditions are the same, such as dressing

up in costumes and overindulging, the holiday
takes on different meanings in childhood and’
adulthood. '

For most children, Halloween is all about
trick—or-treating and consuming as much can-

dy as possible. For many college students, it is ‘

about partying and consuming as much alcohol
as possible. ,

And though some might say that college stu-
dents simply take advantage of any opportunity
to party a little harder, inmy opinion, Halloween
is about more than just partying.

First of all, ‘Halloween provides a way for
us to reconnect with our childhood. In many
ways, our current Halloween celebrations are

. still quite similar to those that we practiced "

as youngsters. Though the trick-or-treating is
replaced by parties and the candy replaced with
alcohol, some constants remain. Dressingup in
costumes is, of course, still the most important
part of any Halloween celebration.
Andlthough the nature of the costumes
might change from childhood to adulthood,
there will still be that one girl in the group of
celebrants who ends up wearing a complicated
and uncomfortable costume and has to be car-
ried home crying at the end of the night. Some
things never change. '
But why is it, exactly, that Halloween is

 such an  holiday to both children

and adults? Unlike religious holidays such as
Christmas, it certainly does not arise from any
sort of deep connectionwith the original mean-
ingbehind the festivities. In fact, I doubtasingle
person wandering around the streets decked out
in full costume on Halloween night would be
able to tell you how the holiday originated.
According to the History Channel website,

, HalloweenbeganasanancientCelticNewYear’s

celebration. Eventually, the holiday came to the
United States and morphed into something
very different from its original form. Withthe
extreme consumption of candy and in the case
of college students, the extreme consumption
of alcohol, Halloween has deﬁnitely become a
distinctly American holiday.

That’s not to say that other countries don’t

continue to celebrate versions of our Hallow-
een. According to another article from history.
com, Spain and Latin American countries hold
celebrations in honor of the dead which begin
on Oct. 31, and festivities in Ireland include
many of the same traditions that we have in
the United States. ‘ ~ by
But it really is no wonder that the United
States has taken the idea of Halloween and run
with it. We Americans love holidays that revolve

-..,..- v »-- _.,..,. .. -m_.~.;g..~ ....—.....-.......1...—-~-.~..-~.,....-..._.z-~~._ -/"'.» .- »n- ...-.. ..

around excess in any form. Thanksgiving is just
one other example of this idea. ,
But aside from the all-Americanneed for
excess,- there many reasons that Halloween is
such a popular holiday for people of all ages.
Primarily, the costume aspect of Halloween
gives us the opportunity to be someone else for
the night. Whereas “Mean Girls” might teachus
that Halloween is justan excuse for girls to dress
in revealing outfits, Ithink this tradition is less _
about wanting to look promiscuous and more

, about challenging societal norms by wearing

somethingthatwouldn’t necessarily be accept-
able in other contexts- _
So, although it could be argued that the tradi-
tion of Halloween has deviated so far from its
origins that it no longerhas any meaningwhat—
soever or that it’s just an excuse for Americans
to overindulge, I have to believe that the holiday
can be redeemed. : ' _
The most important thingabout Halloween

- isthatitprovides opportunities forfantasy and

possibility that aren’t always found in everyday
life, and that is something that will continue
to thrill people as long as they celebrate the
holiday. . ‘ ; ‘

Anderson: a fortunate flutist

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer
Ian Anderson
Carnegie Library of Homestead
Tuesday, 7 p.m.

510 East 10th-Ave., Munhall, Pa.
$45-$55
412-452-3444

One of the things that separated Jethro
Tull from other bands was its ﬂutist, Ian
Anderson. .

Anderson’s North American tour will
bring him to the Carnegie Library of Home-
stead’s Music Hall Tuesday evening.

The British singer and songwriter has
played music for more than 40 years and has
lived and performed through evolutionary
periods of rock history, such as progres-
sive, folk, electronic, hard and world. He

‘played the ﬂute in his own rock band, the

groundbreakingjethro Tull.

Today, Anderson continues to share his
music —- both his work as a frontman for
Jethro Tull as well as acoustic and electronic
pieces of his own. .

Anderson can recall the “rhythmic pulse
of syncopated swing music” from his child-
hood that impacted him and stayed with
him throughout his career. While he went
through a period of life when he played an
electric guitar because it was “the sexy thing

to do,” he was raised primarily on acoustic‘

music and soon went back to his roots.

“I was 18 or 19 when I realized I wasn’t
good at playing [the electric guitar], and Eric
Clapton was,” Anderson said. “I started on
the ﬂute, and it happened to be the lucky
choice of something good to play, and it
got me noticed.”

Jethro Tull gained popularity as Ander-
son taught himself to play the ﬂute. It was a
different instrument from the norm, and as a
result the band’s rock music was “not genre
rock music” and still isn’t today. Anderson
became the man who introduced the ﬂute
to rock music, as well as a self—described
“unplugged musician in the rock band.”

“A part of me still reacts to electronic
rock, but not to the point I want to play it
for two hours,” Anderson said. “You can’t
escape the fact that you have to keep mov-
ing into the current realism of technology
in music. But there are acoustic values I’d
hate to leave behind me. It’s my musical
culture.”

Florian Opahle,.who is playing electric ;

and acoustic guitar with Anderson on this

tour, met Anderson when he played in Ger-

many in 2003 as an opening act forjethro
Tull. The two then coordinated and played
together at two shows. s

“From then on everything happened very
quickly and, on the next Ian Anderson tour,
I found myself on the roads of Italy touring
with Ian. A dream had come true,” Opahle
wrote in an e-mail.

Opahle never wanted to do anything ex-
cept play music, and playing with Anderson
is an enjoyable way for him to pursue what
he loves.

“There are so many fantastic songs
which I really enjoy [playing] ,” Opahle said.

“I really like the arrangement, composi-

CourtesyjethroTull.com

- tion and mood of the tunes. I love playing

these massive songs like ‘Thick As A Brick’
or ‘Budapest"that keep you busy regard-
ing the individual parts, switching from a
quiet section to a rock one, from a folksy
to a classical one. I think that is one of the
major things. It is this beautiful variety of
different musical styles.” ‘
Opahle occasionally plays solo or col-
laborates with blues bands in Germany.
Even though Anderson has released four‘,
solo albums, he’s never gone for a com— ’
pletely solo career — he enjoys the group

For The Pitt News

Last weekend, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
opened its 2010-11 season with the pro-
duction “The ThreelMusketeers.” _

This classical show kicks off a sea-
son that will gradually become more
contemporary, featuring ‘pieces like
“Dracula,” “A Gershwin Fantasy” and
“Balanchine.” I

Originally choreographed in 1980 by
Andre Prokovsky offers a preview of “The
Three Musketeers” is an over—the-top
caricature of the classical ballet formu-
la. It plays on many of the themes and
devices of such masterpieces as “Swan
Lake,” “The Sleeping Beauty,” “Don
Quixote” and essentially anything else
choreographed by Petipa, particularly
in collaboration with the music of Tchai-
kovsky. _

“The Three Musketeers” pays homage
to and simultaneously mocks traditional
ballet. This works quite well as it pro-
vides opportunities tojab at many ofthe
aspects of ballet that seem ridiculous
— both to its fans and to those who are

turned off by the art form — while still '

retaining the aspects of ballets that _are
more successful.

One place where this sardonic ap-
proach is especially effective is in the
choreography offight scenes. Those who
are not well—versed in ballet are often
only -familiar with “The Nutcracker.”
Something that might stand out in peo-
ple’s minds about the holiday favorite is
its absurd fighting. It simply isn’t grati-
fying, or plausible, to watch two people
trade blows while prancing andleaping
in circles around each other.

But, “The Three Musketeers” lays bare.

the device“. Sometimes the musketeers

themselves are so deft that they simply

. take out minions in the course of per-

forming solos, completely oblivious to
the fact that they’re being attacked.

Other times, the male dancers demon-
strate their virtuosity by executing huge
jumps over their adversaries. Rather than
attempting to maintain any gravity, these
scenes embrace their absurdity.

The ballet makes sure to throw equal
jabs at..17th—century French aristocratic

culture. The King, in particular, may be‘
‘one of the funniest characters I have ever

witnessed in a dance. Played by Gilles
Maidon, whohelped perfect the chore-.
ography at Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre,
the King is not only a pretentious fop,
but also an oblivious cuckold to boot.
His dancing is blundering and awkward,

his affectations are effeminate, and he

is so enamored by the spotlight that he
forgets even his-own rules of courtly
decorum.

Nonetheless, the ballet is not always
farcical, and some of its most sincere mo-
ments are also its best. The pas de deux
between D’Artagnan and Constance is
exquisite, and the scene which portrays
theDuke of Buckingham longing after his
distant lover the Queen is both evocative
and graceful. A

The producers mocked the trend in
traditional ballet of one show trying
to outdo the ones preceding it in ex-
travagance, so “The Three Musketeers”
is brimming with‘ gratuitous corps sec-
tions, props, lavish sets and elaborate
costumes. During the coda, they even
throw in a few classic moves that are ab-
sent from therest of the performance.

Yethere is where the ballet -falters
the most. During the performance, the
production’s extravagant layout led to
multiple staging mishaps. At one point,
a stagehand accidentally walked on stage
and removed a piece ofthe set before the
scene ended. At other points, the dancing
was muddled and out of sync‘. '

This must have been a very costly pro-
duction for Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre -
however, they would have done better to
spare some of that expense. Without such
clumsy staging, “The Three Musketeers”
would have made a funny, and also nos-
talgic, parody of the classic.

FOOTBALL L

Panthers rol past ter

Dustin Gabler
For The Pitt News

Pitt football is ﬁnally beginning to live up
to its preseason expectations.

An emotional Rutgers attempted to win
a heartwarming victory but was unable to
stop the Panthers Saturday, as the Scarlet
Knights went down§j'41-21. The team was
returning to action for the ﬁrst time since
junior defensive tackle Eric LeGrand was
paralyzed on a kickoff‘ tackle in an Oct. 16
game versus the Army. '

“It’s classy,” Rutgers head coach Greg
Schiano said regarding a banner signed by
Pitt studentsand athletes.-and the thousands
of “Pitt is pulling for Eric” stickers. “This
league has been great and this whole nation
has been great reaching out and I can’t thank
you enough. I appreciate everyone’s prayers
and outreach.” —

The Pitt offense opened up for its second
straight week of scoring 40-plus points.
Quarterback Tino Sunseri is truly beginning
to hit his stride. Sunseri was successful on 21
of 27 attempts, for a career high 307 yards,
three touchdowns and an interception. The
interception came during the ﬁrst drive on
a screen pass that bounced through Ray
Graham’s arms. ‘ _. _ ’

“Tino Sunseri continued to make prog-
ress,” Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedt said.
“He made decisions in the second half that
he didn’t make in theﬁrst half and he hadn’t
made in the last couple of weeks.”

Sunseri’s production increased Satur-
day as he found his star wide receiver, Jon
Baldwin. Baldwin hauled in ﬁve balls for
139 yards and a touchdown. He also had
two impressive one-handed catches deep
down the ﬁeld. _ ,

“I simply try and make plays when my
number is called,” Baldwin said. “Whether
I get two balls or eight balls, my job is to
make the most of my opportunities.”

The running game is also beginning to
look consistent. 20o9’s Big East Player of
the Year, Dion Lewis, is starting to. perform
like he did last year. He ran 17 times for 130
yards and a touchdown. '

“We always believe that any given player
on this team can have a big day or make
plays,” Sunseri said.,“In the past weeks, guys
like Dion [Lewis] andJB [Baldwin] haven’t
had to make plays because other guys were

' stepping up to make things happen.?’. .

In addition to the oﬁ'ense’s suc'ce‘sses,
the defense also has been performing very
well lately. ‘

The game was tied at 14 when the players
headed» to_:the locker roomat halftime. The

Panthers defense only allowed seven more

points in the second half to hold the Scarlet
Knights_to a total of 21 points. _ _‘
The Pitt defense was led by defensive
ends Jabaal Sheard and Brandon Lindsey. As
a unit, the defense collected seven sacks and
created tons of pressure for Rutgers quar-

terbacks Chas Dodd and Tom Savage." " “

’Nova 

Torie Wytiazl
Staffwri ter

The Pitt volleyball team took a weekend
trip across the state to take on Villanova
and lost to the Wildcats 3-1 on Friday
night. ‘

With. the loss, Pitt fell to 9-14 overall
and 4-4 in Big East play. The win gave?
Villanova (18-4, 6-1) its ﬁfthconsecutive
victory.

“It was good to get a Big East win at
home,” Wildcats head coach Josh Stein-
bach said. “It’s big for us to be 6-1 in the
conference at this point.”

The Panthers won the second set of the
match 25-20, and dropped the ﬁrst, third
and fourth sets with scores of 25-15, 25-16
and 25-18, respectively.

For Rens, the difference between the”
winning set and the losing sets was a de-
gree of aggression and commitment to a
focused game plan.

“In the second set, we executed out
game plan well and really put pressure on
Villanova,” Rens said. “In the sets Where we
were unsuccessful, we backed off a bit and“
strayed from those pressure points.”

‘ Villanova was able to hold Pitt to just
41 kills, while the Wildcats recorded 56
in the match. ’

Key contributors to the Panthers’ of-

' fense were also held to minimal productiv-.,

ity, due in large part to Villanova’s strong
serving. \ . _ L
“Villanova is a great serving team, and
when our serve receive is slightly off, it
affects our ability toédistribute the ball
to some of our successful hitters,” Rens
said.‘ “-5‘

were the middle hitters, senior Imani
Harper and junior Kiesha Leggs, who col-
lected 14 total kills.

“When our middle hitters cannot get

~ the ball as often, it puts more pressure on

:;.

the outside hitters,” Rens said. “Without
offensive balance, the team suffers.”

Despite the loss, the Panthers were
able to improve on their defense, as they
had more digs than their opponents for
the fourth consecutive match.

Sophomore Margy Acton, who recently
set the Pitt record for most digs in a match,
led the Panthers with 18 digs.

“Defensively, I was pleased with our.

performance as far as digging goes,” Rens
said. “Blocking, however, was difficult as
we had trouble tracking their hitters and
controlling our transition game.” '

“Marquette is more of an aggressive team

keep the pace fast, but sometimes their

The Panthers will face both opponents
onthe road in the ﬁnal two matches of a
four-contest away streak. '

According to Rens, the “visiting” fac-
tor is only as important as Pitt team allows
it to be.

“If we can keep our focus and compo-
