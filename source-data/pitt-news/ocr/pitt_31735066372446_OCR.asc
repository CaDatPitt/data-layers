Pistella. elected to the House

the impact of taking on legisla-

be similar to representing “a

because the university generates

If you can conceive ol math
as a language. a way ofcommun-
icating certain kinds of ideas. it
becomes easier to understand the
life of a mathematician. A

a man lluent in the language of
mathematics. which he has

about the basic truths in life.“
Bing said. “l want to understand
better how the universe is put
together. what makes it work."

Raised in a family of “achiev-
ers." with a mother who prac-
ticed math as a hobby. Bing
acquired an inquisitiveness that
saw him through the boredom of
the standard high school math
courses.

Speaking with a slight drawl.
Bing describes the earl_y years of
his schooling as “rote learning.
and not much else."

“l was always wondering
about what was behind a thing."

Bing said that is the reason he
has always been interested in
geometry. For him. the discipline

is not simplya series of formulas.
but rather a method ofcoming to
grips with the way things work.

sophisticated. Bing said that it
became a discipline around l9l()
and since then has become a
standard element in most univer-
sity mathematics programs.

Despite the rarefied nature of
his field. Bing‘s career has had a
practical side. He spent six years
teaching high school math before

insight into the problems of

"What they had in India was

that so many school children in

CAS Council Postpones Changes

By FREDERICK BEERS

lhe f:iilure ol the facult_v of Arts
and Sciences (l-AS) to come to a
decision on ctirrictilum reforms
forced the College of Arts and Scien-
ces (‘otincil ((‘AS(‘) to postpone its
main order of btisiiiess on l-rida_\.

According to CAS l)ean Irwin
Schulman. after the faculty comes to
a decision on the proposed reforms.
CASC must determine how to apply
the changes to transfer and relocat-
ing students.

Schulman said he “assumed opti-
mistically that the faculty would
have done its work by now on going
through all the curriculum
proposals.”

FAS ’will meet on Tuesday. Schul-
man said.

Couricil also put offa decision on
a proposed joint degree program
between (‘AS and the School of
Engineering. The degree would
require five years of study.

Schulman said the engineering
school received the proposal well.
but that CASC can't act on it until it
knows what its own general educa-
tion requirements will be.

Two committees were also formed
at the meeting. one on the Semester
at Sea program. and another to plan

for the Advising Center. The council

decided not to take up the issue of
academic credit for ROTC courses.

Schulman, said the first committee
will be composed of people from
CAS. the Senate Educational Poli-
cies Committee. and the Advisory
Committee to the Semester at’Sea
program.

Schulman said this committee will
decide whether Semester at Sea
should be terminated or continued.
If they recommend continuation.
Schulman said they should look at
the program‘s weaknesses and
decide how to remedy them.

The decision to form the Advising
Center Committee was made “in

light of budget cutbacks.” Schulman V

said.

“The Advising (‘cnter‘s future will
be different from its recent past.”
Schulman said. “beca Lise of the con-
straints under which tAhey‘re
operating.”

The dean said (‘AS needs to make
“common decisions

some
about how best to make use of the
limited resources” of the Advising
Center.

The issue of credit for ROTC
courses was brought before council
at the request of Air Force ROTC
personnel. Schulman said. He
pointed out that Pitt is'among the

SCUSC

‘gainority of institutions that don’t.

give credit for such courses. and said
that several arguments could be
madelfor or against giving credit.

Jonathan Harris of the political
scieneei*depzirtment said he doesn’t
believe": that a liberal arts college
should train military officers. Schul-
man countered with the familiar
argument that military officers who
have a background in liberal arts
tend to be more open-minded.

A motion by Harris that the issue

not be taken up was passed
unanimously.

future meetings. Such issues include
grade inflation. laetilt_\' responsibrl--
ity and integrity. policies on proba-
tion and suspension. and the
problem of late withdrawals.
Schulman. saying that most of
the grades gixen in (‘AS courses are
“A‘s“ and  asked council
whether the issue should be taken
up. and if so. whether anything can
be donessince the trend is so firmly
established.

Ted Windt of the speech depart-
ment said that students are
“shocked" when they discover
they‘\c gotten a C or I). He reported
that his office has been flooded by
students who got “C’s" and “l)’s" on
his midterm.

As to faculty responsibility and
integrity. Schulman said the main
problems include finals being given
before exam week. faculty who are
habitually late to or absent from
class. and faculty who fail to adhere
to grading policy and procedures.

Phil Stehle of the physics and
astronomy department questioned
the policy that gives faculty only two
days to get‘ grades to the registrar
after the final exam period.

Schulman said that in CAS. the
early deadline is helpful to students
on probation. He said that such stu-
dents are allowed to register fora
term only if they did acceptable
work in the preceding term.

The dean added. however. that he
didn't know why the registrar
requires such an early deadline. but

promised to consult that office and
report back to the council.

On probation and suspension pol-

ic_\. the problem is a “function of

mechanical factors." Schulman said.

He noted that students can go
through “two years of poor work
before the ax falls." and although he
would like to review individual stu-
dent‘.s' transcripts eyery term. this is
impossiblebecausc the information
is not on a computer.

Stehle suggested “deputi/ing"
advisers. but Schulman pointed out
that there is the problem of pre-
registration.

Schulman said that CASC
members should bring in “concrete
proposals“ to their next meeting for
discussion.

The problem of late withdrawals.
Schulman said. involves students
who don‘t process withdrawals. and
standards for
withdraivals.

“The whole thing has lost legiti-
macy as an academic procedure."
Schulman said.

He added that students are getting
around ‘the proper procedures for
late withdrawals. ‘

The question of instituting With-
drawal Passing and Withdrawal

Failing grades was brought up.
Schulman said it had been consi-

dered but the registrar’s office said it

couldn't handle this procedure.
Schulman said he would seek the

administration‘s help in the matter.

has also had partial responsibil-
ity for the area which includes
Pitt. but will give that area up to
Pistella if the proposed reappor-
tionment is not delayed by any of
a number of petitions before the
state Supreme Court asking that
the reapportionment be changed
or stopped.

State reaipportionment of
legislative districts is done every
I() years as a result of new census
figures which would indicate
either an increase or a decrease of
population within a certain
district.

While preferring to withold
additional comment on the reap-
portionment. Pistella was critical
of the governor‘s proposed l per-
cent across-the-board cut. *

The proposed cut. which must
be approved by the state legisla-
ture. would cut Pitt‘s fiscal year
I982 appropriation by $748.()00.
Penn State would see its appro-

priations cut by Sl.33X.U()().
while the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency
would face a ‘5742.()()() cut in the
amount of scholarships it awards
to state students.

Pistella said this would causea -
double whammy for state stu-
dents: as students attending a
state—supported school. and as
scholarship recipients facing a
decrease in state-supported
scholarships.

The governor‘s impetus for the
cuts resulted from the loss of
approximately $267 million
from federal budget reductions
and business tax cuts approved
by Congress earlier this year.

Pistella maintained that thc.......«

governor would "have problems
when he gets involved in (cut-
ting) legal committments." such
as the state’s debt service.

“He (Thornburgh) figures that
he pays for enough attorneys he
doesn't have to worry about poor
people. A lot of these programs
have already been cut." Pistella
complained.

Pistella is 21 I969 graduate of
Central Catholic High School in
Oakland and a l973 graduate of

John Carroll University in Ohio.

r

This month marks the beginning
of the second annual undergraduate
essay competition cosponso_red by
the College of Arts and Sciences and
the Pitt English Department.
“Alumni

The contest. entitled

Awards for Excellence in Under—i

graduate Writing." was originated
by CAS Dean Irwin Sehulman and
/writing professor David Bartholo-
mae. According to Bartholomae.
who is alsojdirector of Pitt‘s compo-
sition department. the idea was for-
mulated in conjunction with the
general movement towards curricu-
lum reform. The contest was created
“to recognize student achic\cments
and t_o recognize the departments in
which the students do their work.”
Bartholomae said. ‘

Essays submitted for the contest
must have been written to fulfill the
requirements of a course taken at
Pitt during the winter. spring or
summer terms of the 198! school
year. All subject matter will be
accepted. with the exceptions offic-
tion and prose.

The PM News, Monday. November_ /6, I 98/

Bartholomae said that the “essays
arejudged as pieces ofwriting.“ The
degree of difficulty of the subject
matter does not bias the judges.
Instead. Bartholomae said that the
judges are more concerned with
"evidence of student thinking.
research and understanding of their
subject."

“Wejudge the degree to which the
students do an impressive job of
showing what they know.“ Bartho-

’ lomae said.

Bartholomae also said that the‘
essays should be stylishly written.
“A well researched but dull paper is
not a winner.”

Most importantly. the judges are
looking for pieces of scholarship.
They want to see students “thinking
out problems in an impressive way.”
according to Bartholomae.

The panel of contest judges
includes Bartholomae and three
members of the faculty who are
appointed by Schulman.

The contest features a first place
award of $I00 for the best essay.
Two second place essays are

awarded $50. Also. five honorable .

mention certificates are awarded to
worthy achievements. Prize money
is furnished by the Alumni Giving
Fund. I
Bartholomae said he hopes that
there is a lot ofstudent participation

in this year’s contest. He said he was

. disappointed by the small number of

essays submitted in last year‘s con-
test. Of the estimated fifty entries
last year. only three were prize

winners. said Bartholomae.

Essay Writing Contest Opens This Month

Last years winner. Steven Mar:

and to Mark (ioet7’s Impact uflhe
Battle of Brilian on Strategic’ Com-
har Plamiing. a freshman studies
paper.

Deadline for essay submissions is
February I. I982.

Bartholomae encouraged stu-
dents to send in their entries.

“I think students are hesitant to
dig out old papers but I wish they

’ would do so.“ he said. One of the

advantages Ba rt holomae sees in this
contest is that students are allowed
to revise their essays after receiving
comments from their pi'ofessoi's.

Essays should be submitted to
David Bartholomae in room 526
Cathedral of learning, or to the
English Department. For more

undergraduate students to become

affiliation with the university. The
board is comprised of ministers and
lay people at the Bellefield Presby-
terian Church. '

“it looked to me that the board of

directors had more control over the

group than its officers." he said. “If

they (board) were from the univer-

sity. that would have been
different."
Board member (‘olleen Clarke

echoed the opinions of Del.uca say-

ing that the group was “too attached

to the church." '

“If something happened. who
would be the governing group? The
university or the church'.’" she said.

Representatives of the Campus
Christian Outreach Ministry. who
were absent at the original meeting.
showed up at 'l7hursda.y‘s meet.ing to
answer the questions the board had
concerning the race issue.

Board member Terri Slack read a

passage from the group‘s constitu-'

tion and questioned the phrase that

said one of the goals of the’ group
was to “meet the needs of black
students."

Spokesman for the group. Mike
Major. read a passage from the SUB
handbook on student organi/ations
and quoted the descriptions of the
fullvy—recogni/ed Black Action

Aig’:].Soeicit_v and Black Engineers. Both

of those descriptions also read to
"meet the needs of black students."

“There needs to be an organi/a-
tion that looks specifically at the
black spiritual needs at Pitt." Ma_jor
said.

l)el.uca then asked him what the
difference was between black spirit-
uality and white spirituality.

textbook reading. time management
and test—taking skills.

According to Materniak.  stu-
dent counselor is not a tutor. but a
facilitator of learning.

“A facilitator of learning is some-
one who teaches another person
how to become independent and

teach himself. as opposed to a tutor

who teaches a person about a certain
subject." she explained.

Besides being interested in heTping
others. the qualifications necessary
to become a student academic coun-
selor include a stable and above-

Major told the board that blacks
get an “inferiority complex“ where

"()nl_v two out of the 70 student
counselors we‘ve had during the past

Matierniak said. “The majority have

had majors in biology. political
science. engineering or history."
Many of members of Pitt’s

The board also granted partial or
full recognition to four other
groups. .

Included among those given full
status are the Student American
Hygiene Association and the Pitt
International Affairs Forum.
Organi/ations given partial status
are the Philosophy Club and Pitt’s
Chapter of Constitutional Syndical—
ism (CSP).

The Student American Hygiene
Association is comprised of over l()()
dental hygienists. Members assist in

l.SC for help.

“Many of these men and women
are in the midst of a career change
and come here to brtish up on var-
ious lcarning skills.“ said Tom l.uci—
dorc. the l.SC math coordinator.
“It's often reassuring to work with a
student counselor in a similar sitiia—
tion and who really knows what it is
like.“

ln addition to filling out an appli-
cation and returning it tothe l.SC

student should be prepared to enroll

hours a week are not the only advan-
tages of becoming a student counse-
lor.

"In two or three years of working
here. a student counselor gains a cer-
tain amount ofexpertise that will be
beneficial in any career.” Materniak
said. “Both employers and graduate
schools view this work experience as
a real asset.“

According to her. Bell l.abs hired
three student counselors who were
computer science majors with 3.9

at the [SC A i

The l.SC staff also views student
counselors as real assets.

“The counselors are also out in
the classroom trenches and know
what skills are best applied to spe-

“Student counselors are enthusiastic

learning experience. don‘t get stale.“

occurred. most noticeably. this year.

Pitt's Artists Form Leaque

By BILL KOWNACKI

l’itt‘.s first organi/ed art
club was formed recently by
undergraduate art major Bob
l’almeri.' Known as the
l.cagtie oi‘ /\rtists. the group
has been in existence since the
beginning oi‘ the term and has
just been legally recogni/ed
by the uniyersity.

Palmeri decided earlier this
year to liorni the league
becatise he belieyed art stu-
dents needed a common
meeting ground to share and
discuss ideas. and just get
together in an informal situa-
tion outside of the classroom.

Although student interest
in the group was slow attliirst.
(the only people at‘ the: first
meeting were Palmeri and a
friend). the membership
quickly picked‘ up to its citr-
rent leyelol‘ l7 members and i '
faculty adyisor (iirts Purins.‘

Much of‘ the group’s suc-
cess in‘ recruiting i new
members was a result of the _
posters Palmeri placed at yar-, ’

ious sites in the liick line
Arts Building and the
(‘athedral of learning. lhe

topics. A future speaker. for

A NEW  wonnn vmw  

Jeremy lutkln is a radical speaker
and thinker, appearing regularly on
television andbefore university and P

community audiences. He is an
advisor on economic and social op- 
tions to labor, management, Congres-
sional Committees and “The President's
Commission on the Agenda for the 1980's".

in who should Play God, The North will Rise
Again and particularly in The Emerging
Order he has captured the attention at the
religious community with an examination of
the current Christian evangelical revival and
the impact it has had on American culture.
His latest book, Entropy: A New World View,
provides the basis for two lectures to be held
Tuesday, November 17, at the University of
Pittsburgh. it is a provocative analysis of the
relationships between the first two laws of
thermodynamics and economic, political
and social development: in a world of
diminishing energy resources, new
understandings on the part of developing
nations are necessary. Whether or not you
agree with his conclusions, you'll find his
thoughts and insights stimulating.

At 3:30 p.m. in the Pitt Student Union
Dining Room, Qr. John Nelson will
discuss Jeremy Rifkin's analysis in
“Understanding Futuroiogy: Jeremy
Rifkin’s Thought". Dr. Nelson is author
of Your God is Alive and Well and Ap-
pearing in Popular Culture, and form-
erly a professor of theology at Pitts-
burgh Seminary. He is now a pastor in
Trenton, New Jersey. Response will follow
by Ms. Gail Heffner, consultant for Com-
munity Technical Assistance Center. After

spending several years in campus ministry,
she completed her master's degree at Pitt's
Graduate School of Public and International
Affairs where she specialized in the world
hunger problem. This seminar will be a good
foundation for interaction later in the even-
ing. At 8:00 p.m. in the auditorium of Pitt's
Graduate school of Public Health, Jeremy
Rltkln will speak to the topic, “Entropy: A New
World View". Both Dr. Nelson and Ms. Heffner

. will be present to respond. We are hoping

that this address will initiate dialogue about
the future and direction of our culture.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17 AT 3:30 AND 8:09PM

These lectures have been made possible by a generous grant from the Pitcairn-Crabbe FOU|'ld§l«lO{I.,\’ 1-’!

and are sponsored by the University Chaplains Association.

Counseling Center Helps Studentisl/Vith l3roblems

By MIKE MALLINGER
While occasional emotional prob-
. lems do flare up in the Pitt student
‘population. that student body is
lairl_v vvell adjusted. and exceptional
problems are for the most part sol-
vable. according to a university
psychologist.

Robert Gallagher. director of
Counseling and Placement Services.
talks out student problems in his
counseling sessions so troubled stu-
dents may begin to live creativeand
productive lives.

Of the thousand students who
seek out personal counseling during

V the year. the majority sufferthrough
the breakdown of relationships with
boyfriends or girlfriends or families.

Although many students with
prbblettts do not think they are
going to survive. “the human body
and mind are remarkable in their
ability to overcome these problems.”
according to Gallagher.

He describes most people he sees
as sane and responsible persons who
have normal developmental prob-
lems “that all oi‘ us are having in one
way or another." he said.

Failure to make‘ progress with
problems they are having on their
own or with an unproductive recon-

meiliatitin with friends may lead a stu-

e

dent to consult with a professional.
he said.

Gallagher was quick to dispel the
misconception “that what we see
here are very sick people."

As a professional. Gallagher’*-is
able to spot severely disturbed stu-
dents. who number only two or three
percent of total cases. he said.

Members of that group are often
referred to outside professionals.
but some ztiemanagettble within the
framework of_ the university coun-
seling. he added.

- “A lot of changes that occur in
people not only occur by what
. happens in a counseling hour. butby

what the person does between coun-
seling sessions.“ he added.

He also emphasized that a person
can actually er’/eatc: “I've seen people
overcome all kinds of external pres-
sures and create for themselves a_
very nice and creative life. So I have
to believe that people have inﬂuence
on their own personal growth.“

Part of Gallagher’s duties include
supervision of the,Career Counsel-
ing program. That programs steers
undergraduates towzird an occupa-
tion when the studentimay not have
any direction. as to which occupa-

tion he desires to tackle after grad-
uation.

Occasionally; students become
concerned when they do not achieve
the success in college they had
attained in high school. Gallagher
pointed out. «

While noting that “everybody-

can‘t be at the top." he.added that
high grades do help snare that initial
job. but that there is evidence to
showthat“performanceonthejobis
not really that related to your gra-
duating grades." -

Recruiters pay attention to other
parts of the picture whether the
person is well adjusted. whether the
prospective employee has positive
feelings about himself and whether
he was confident enough to have
done reasonably good work in
college. e

“We are trying to havepeople‘ get
a more realistic image about them-

’ selves and also to get a more accu

rate picture about the outside world.
including the realities of the career
world at the present time." Gal-
lagher said. '
V A student experiencing‘ severe
feelings of depression is sent out for
a physical. Should the physical turn
up nothing. counselors a.e often
able to help that student. he
continued.

“Fairly frequently. students will
come in upset because ofa relation-

ship that hasjust dissolved and they
get very. very upset about it and
don’t think they are going to sur-
vive.“ Gallagher said. ‘

Gallagher added that each psy-
chologist on the staff has an individ-
ual approach and style of dealing
with patients. but every counselor
offers the student the option oftalk-
ing out the problem at length and
getting reassured that the problem
can be overcome based on the coun-
selor‘s experience with many other
similar problems.

According to Gallagher. the psy-
chologist allows the student “to feel
they are not alone in the world; that
they can sit and talk to a person who
(is) concerned about them. and who
helps them discover that they are not
as fragile as they think they are. . . 

A breakdown in a relationship

- ing that person toward feelings of

anxiety and negative feelings. he
said. .

Such a person may adopt the
notion. “l‘m not a capable person or
it just means I’m a ‘no-good-nick‘
or nobody else will ever love me." he
added.

The situation may appear hope-
less at first. when the feelings are
very intense and “almost pathologi-
cal at times." according to
Gallagher. «

“Most people who suffer t'heseter-
rible stresses don't think that they

are going to get over it. but they do. '

time and time again."

Psychologists extend a hand that
has helped many students with sim-
ilar problems. which expresses the
counselo~»‘r’s confidence that the stu-
dent‘s problems will be resolved. he
added.

"We help draw them out. we help
them talk about their fears and help
_.them understand that they are not

u

    
   

powerless in the situation."Gallagh-
er said.

He encourages students to start
establishing new relationships-- the
sooner they go about that. the bet-

ter they are in many ways. he noted. -

Counseling often leads a student
to new insights about himself. A stu-
dent may begin to look at himself in
a dramatically different light while
going on to. solve problems in
entirely new ways. according to
Gallagher.

He maintains that counseling is
not a simple behavioral technique-

that plugging in a certain style of

counseling does not result in certain
kinds of behavior.
with a counselor is a new experience
for both the student and his psychol-
ogist. and neither party knows
where it is going to go. he said.
“lt‘s kind of a creative exchange
between the two people." Gallagher
added.

The Pitt News

Endorsements

Perhaps. as one student government board hopeful
offered. we are living in conservative times. Maybe this
conservative trend is accountable for the noticeable
lack of issuesin this year‘s student government board
campaign. lt could be why a majority ofthe candidates
spoke mainly of increasing student awareness and

' involvement and little ofwhat would happen after the

students became involved and aware. Perhaps.

But we doubt it. '

Wethink there are many important issues that SGB
can deal with. We also believe that the larger field of
candidates-~ l4 running foreight board spots and four
presidential contenders ---- ~ is a sign that students do
have the incentive to make SGB a workable”tool for
Pitt ugdergraduates. ii

That’s why. in looking over this year’s field ofcandi-
dates. a few are recognivable as potential outstanding
board members. They seem to reject the notion that
the issues -aren’t there, because they have very specific
ideas on how to solve very specific problems. They
believe that student government should do more for
students than just inform them that it exists.

For these same reasons. we endorse Colleen Clarke
for president. Clarke. a former chairperson of the
allocations committee and-aiipresent board member.
has good organizational skills. and seems to cast a
wary eye at administration interferencein student
government. something that we haven‘t seen around
here for a while. . _

It was a difficult decision. Her most notable con-
tender Todd DeLuca. is also a capable and expe-
rienced candidate. ‘ pi

-Clarke. however, has the ability to prod the board
into doing what its supposed to do-— mainly. to work
for students. The current board has very few accom-

plishments to stand on. and'we ‘hope that Clarke...ca‘”n

-/

change that. -

Among the board candidates. allocations commit-
tee member James Shelton is easily the most compe-
tent. Shel-ton -would like the. SGB‘t(-rinvestigate the
effectiveness of various student services. such as the
advising center. and is pushing '—for*mandatori—y.pub‘-

lished evaluations of both teachers and advisors. He ‘C
also wants to look into the problem of the decline in .

the Black Studies Department.

Another candidate. if Linda O’Connor is the

A’ spokesperson during the curriculum reform meetings

has proven‘ herself to be responsible. and out-
spoken. a student not afraid to fight for students.

ln addition. we think Chip Roth. presently the

chairperson ofthc governmental relations committee.

‘.would make an effective board member.‘ Roth is con-

cerned with the issue that concerns your pocketbook-
tuition hikes» and has been instrumental in
organizing students to fight against it.

Finally. we endorse former Resident Student Asso-
ciation president RobbiejThe'. The’ has had consider-
able experience in student government. and has
important and constructive criticism of the board’s
allocation process. _ .

We hope that the larger field of candidates will
inspire a larger student turnout the past _vear‘s elec-
tion caused passing interest. ~

‘Finally. we hope that/the board members who eveii—

itually take office work to fulfill the promises they offer

in the campaign.

Need For A Solid Economy

By CHRIS ST.JOHN

For'most of this year. I have fol-
lowed with close interest the Reagan‘
Administrations hooting down of
warnings that it should move more
cautiously on the tax and budget
cuts that it hoped would stimulate
the economy. .

The President’s economic pro-
gram. the White House said. was too
carefully synchronized and too deli-
cately calibrated to tamper with. lts
message was that if anything were
changed nothing would work.

As recent ly as last week. President

‘Reagan declared himself satisfied
that his policies are sound and that
his administration has only to stiffen
its spine and push hardcr«for its
reforms. - .

g_ The Prcsident‘s only concession
to growing skepticism in Congress.
as the recession deepens and interest
rates remain high. is to postpone
until next year his request for still
deeper budget cuts and some
selected tax increases.

Now Washington has been

. treated to yet another view of the

Reagan economic program. not by
some outside critic but by David
Stockman. the l’rc.sideni‘s budget

director and head lumbcrjack in the
budg‘ctary forest. ‘ .
Stockman also has been one of
Washington’s most vigorous advo-
cates of the supply-side theory of
economics that provides the philo-
sophical base for the Administra-
tion’s policies. V
Supply—siders argue that deep tax
cuts will put enough money into the

hands of consumers and entreprc- '

neii rs to create a flurry ofbuying and

building that inevitably leads to

prospcritypt  ' -

That was the theory behind the
25"; cut in the income tax rate that
Congress approved earlier this year.
The budget cuts were an after-
thought. designed to hold down the

federal budget deficit ifthe .supply--
the’

siders were
expected flurry. L
But Stockman is now quoted as
saying that the economic plan was
not very well synchroniied after all
that the administration‘s economic
forecasts were largcl_v guesswork.
and that the tax-cut package was a
Trojan H orsc in a fight for tax
reductions for the nation’s wealtliy.
The White House rationale.
according to Stockman. was that if
‘the wealthy paid fewer taxes. they

wrong about

could afford to invest more in new
enterprises that would in turn create
new iohs. .

But. in order to make such tax
reductions palatable. Stockman
said. taxes had to be cut across the
board; enter the Trojan Horse. .-

The disclosures are not something
that Stockman suddenly blurted out
in the presence of someone w'itl;iiizi
pad and pencil. He has. it seems.

been meeting off and on with"-a
respected Washington ’journalist.

=~Willia—m (-i~r-eideij ol‘-Tire Wnvliirrgrori .

Post. and letting down ‘ his hair.
Stockman thought it was all off the
record. (ircider thought otherwise.

Stockman has damaged the Whitiv

House. Forka President with less
-good will among Americans. his
remarks [could have been devastat-
ing. Fvcn for Reagan. they will
embarrass him the next time he
assures Congress that he is on the-
_ right -track.
The President could. and should.
.,use the Stockman episode to order.
his advisors back to their calculators
to find economic policies that are
less rooted in ideology and more in

the real needs of the economy that .
needs a solid foundation for long-‘

term growth.

A Dangerous Precedent For Students

l)ca r Edilo r:

j I feel that your paper has done a
great scr\icc to the (ieography
l)cpartincnt (iraduatc Student
()rgani/ation by publication of the

' articles concerning their grievance

against Dean .lcromc Roscnberg‘s
second proposal to terminate the
l)cp;irtmcnt of (icography at the
llnivcrsity of l’ittsburgh.

People need to be aware of the
lack of proceduics or the enforce!
ment of procedures that have
occurred in this case. and which

i could occiiriii others if this depart-

ment is allowed to fold. In a .lune Its’.
l9ts’l l'I11'\'w'.vi'I_i‘ Ti/m's article l)can
’Roscnbcrg is quoted as saying that
of the 30 Faculty of Arts and -Sci-
ences departments. only ltt or l9 are
essential to maintain at a university
the size of Pitt. lfgcography istcrmi—
nated. wliicli will be next‘?

/\ second conﬁsidcrationk is the
amount of time that has been wasted
since I977 by faculty and stiidentsin

advisory mcctiiigs. chairman search
‘committees. etc. If one carefully
examines this case. one will see that
even though the dean accepted the
charge to strengthen the depart-
ment. his actions have indeed weak-
ened it. Taxpayers should be con-
cerned because ofthc costs and time
that have gone into meetings should
have been spent more clifcctivcly
doing other things.

Hiially. there is a question about
basic integrity. Students have been
coming to the lll‘.l\L.‘l‘.\‘ll_\‘ of Pitts-
burgh. and staying. inthe hope of
gaining a quality education. Tlicy
haxc been hurt worst of all in this
situation. They ha\c u been demor-
ali‘/cd because they haie been told
tliatthcir degrees are \\ ortlilcss. The
(lCpLll'IlTlL‘lll has been unable to offer
the seminars they need because
faculty numbers haxc been so
greatly l'L‘LlllCL‘d.',,

I am one of the members of the
(ESO. I feel that we havea legitimate
grievance and need to he ink-._~n
seriously because a daiigcroiis prece-

dent may be being set in this case.
one that could have e\cn more
serious consequences in the future.
And most import:int|_v. tlicredoes
not at present appear to be any
procedures for students to follow

when they feel they have been,

unfairly treated by ad ministratioii

a situation that should be remedied
if Jstiidents are to get a quality. rele-
vant education.

The Pit! .\’eii:s', Mum/a_i'. Nuveni/wr I6. I98]

 

It was a day of celebrating for Julius Dawkins
as he hauled in 4 touchdowns and set a new

Pitt record for most TD catches in a season

Julius Dawkins lazily trotted
fr_om the huddle to his wide receiver
position. It had been an easy game
so far with Pitt leading l4-0. and it
was going to get easier. Julius Daw-
kins knew that the minute he
reached the line of scrimmage.

You see. what Dawkins‘ sawl

would send ebullient shivers down-

any redblooded American receivers,
body, especially one as frustrated as»
Dawkins. Julius Dawkins was»frus-
trated because after tying the Pitt‘
record of 10 touchdown receptions-
in a season. the balls “weren’t com-
ing his way any more." It had been ‘
three weeks since thejunior receiver
had done his end-zone dance. But
what he saw at the l3—yard line
ended all frustrations and brought
back that happy. swivel-hip
celebration.

In front of him stood one cadet.
one defender who knew not what
Dawkins was going to do.

Quarterback Dan Marino. over at
center. knew what to do. Realizing
the mismatch. Marino called an
audible at the line. Dawki.ns exe-
cuted the inside slam. the ball was
there. and one nifty.spin-around-to-
avoid-four-eadets—move later. the
record was his. and the dance was
alive and well.

“I was very happy about the
record. The ball wasn’t coming my
way lately but [just worked hard.
and kept on coming." Dawkins said.

To the Army Cadets. Julius Daw-
kins must have seemed like the

second. third and fourth coming of
MacArthur. Dawkins kept on
returning and returning to haunt the
undermanned and undersized
Cadets. Four times to be exact.
Dawkins crossed the goal line with a
Marino bullet safely tucked away.
Three of those times. Army’ used
the same goal—line defense and three
times Marino and Dawkins burned
the Cadets with the same pattern.
“They were playing four across.
and not giving us the outside. so I
audibled Julius to run the inside
post.” Marino explained.
Stubbornly refusing to part with
their four-across defense. which
strings out four defensive backs
across the goal—line. Marino had no
choice—- not that he wanted any
other——— but to feed Dawkins inside
post patterns till the belly of the
Cadet defense was exposed and

beaten. Beaten so badly that by the

time Dawkins scored his fourth
touchdown. tying his own single-
game record. the dance wasn’t even
jolly.just matter—of-fact. It had been
too easy.

This whole season had been some-
what easy fer Julius Dawkins. or so

it's seemed. Thejunior. whose action
for two seasons was returning punts‘

and an occasional catch. has become
Pitt’s dutch receiver in a season
when nearly everyone thought
Dwight Collins would be the top
pass-catcher.

season games and a bowl game to

Pitt Outmans Army, 48-O;

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

To be humane. someone should

have given the overmatched Army‘

Cadets blindfolds and cigarettes
Saturday.

The No. l-ranked Pitt Panthers
(9-0) were only giving out punish-
ment. led by a stifling defense and an

offense that executed with deadly ‘

precision. as the Panthers crushed
the Cadets 48-U before a Pitt Sta-
dium crowd of 53.225.

The victory brought an enhanced
feeling of Vindication to the Panth-
ers who. after several rocky games
against lesser teams. have proved
worthy of the No. l mantle the last
two weeks with baek—to—back
impressive wins. Pitt‘s three—week
stay on college football’s summit is
the longest any team has clungto the
No. l spot in this star~crossed l98l
season.

“Now people from San Francisco
to Atlanta should realize we deserve
to be the No. l team. We’re as good
as anybody in the country." said Pitt
Coach Jackie-Sherrill.

According to the rankings. Pitt is
better. and is also in the enviable
position of picking and choosing
what major bowl game the team will
agree to bless with its presence when
the official invitations are extended
this Saturday. .

‘If the players had the final say.
they don’t. the Panthers
would be in New Orleans to usher in
the New Year at the Sugar Bowl.
Representatives from both the Cot-
ton and Sugar Bowls have shadowed
Pitt the last few weeks, but thoughts
of Bourbon Street have already been
dancing in several Pitt players’
minds.

‘‘I’d like to go to the Sugar Bowl.”
linebacker Sal Sunseri.
“When you have people like (Phil)
Pu7.7.uoli and myself on a team. we
could be great on Bourbon Street.“

For /the uninitiated. Puzzuoli. a
defensive tackle. has built a reputa-
tion on his deranged sense ot the
comedic his teammates call him
“Freak" for his penchant for the
unordinary. like tackling Christmas
trees in hotel lobbies.

The Pitt defense led by J.C.Pelusi, No.52, pressured the

Army offense all day.

Sunseri‘s affection for the Sugar
Bowl seems to be a sentiment shared
by most of the Pitt team. though
Bourbon Street isn’t the only consid-
eration guiding Sherrill‘s choice of
bowls and in the end. Sherrill says
his vote still counts.

“Certainly. it seems the Sugar
Bowl is where the players want to go.’
but l‘m the head coach and it-mat-

ters where I want to go too.”Sherrill
said and smiled. “There are a couple
of considerations. lt depends who
you're playing. what their ranking is.
lf it was only the money. it’s obvious
where we would go."-

That would be the Cotton Bowl.

Pantherswim Team Crushes Kent Sta e

By SEAN BARNES

_ The Panther swimming and div-
ing team opened their dual meet sea-
son on F.riday with a powerful 70-42
victory over the Kent State Golden
Flashes. Pitt claimed first places in
diving and ten of eleven possible
firsts as well in the swimming events
as head coach Fred Lewis smiled at
his freshmen‘s first collegiate meet.

Outstanding Pitt freshmen per-
formances in the meet included dual

T winners Ed Bergan and Ed Lal\’oue.
Bergan led Pitt‘s winning 4()0—yard
medley relay and individually. won
the 200—yard backstroke event.

LaNoue beatsome tough KSU
veterans in the l()()-yard freestyle
and then swam in Pitt’s winning 400-
yard freestyle relay in the meet‘s last
event. He also touched first in the
50-yard freestyle with a time of
2!."/5. but since hc'was only swim-
ming as an exhibition entry. first
place went to Pitt's Pete Doyle with.
a 22.l3. . -

The other happy member o.f Pitt's
coaching staff is diving coach Julian
Krug. Although his freshman recruit
Shawn Mcl.ane sat out against KSU
with his injured knee. junior Mil<_e

_Minik dove well enough to capture
first on both the one- and three-
meter boards. Minik‘s one-meter

score also qualified him for the
national pre-qualification meet in
March. His three—meter perform-
ance missed the national cut by
only four—tcnt_hs of a point.

Although no national cut times
occurred in the swimming events.
Lewis said he was very pleased with
his swimmers‘ performances.

“A lot of people put in a lot of
good effort." said Lewis. “From the
seniors right on down to the fresh-
men. they all put in fast races for fast

times."

Lewis was especially happy with
seniors Rick Carter and Sandy Pid-
geon. Pidgeon swam four of the
meet’s toughest events. the 5()0- and
l0(l()-yard freestyle. the 200-yard

individual medley(lM ). and the 200-‘

yard breaststroke. In all but the 5()0-
yard freestyle. his times were the
fastest: however. his teammate
Doug Condon was awarded first in
the 2()0—yard breaststroke. since Pid-
geon was swimming exhibition.
Pidgeon‘s time in the l()00-yard
freestyle was expected to be fast. but
not as fast as it turned out to be.
Pidgeon finished the 40-lap event in
9:4l.l9." lapping every other
swimmer in the pool. Three events

Lady Swimmers

By JODY GIDLEY   ‘

\

p(As expected. the Lady Panther
swim team cruised to victory in their
home season debut by drowning out
Kent State University 83-54 Friday.

‘Pitt totally dominated "both the
swimming and diving events i_n the
meet and swam very well when con-
sidering their competition ‘or their
lack of it. According to Pitt head
coach Dave Belowich. whoiwass
extremely pleased with his team‘s
performance, sometimes it's hard to
internally motivate yourself to do
your best when swimming against a
team of a lower caliber.

“l was very happy withthe way
the girlsswam and l was especially
pleased with the enthusiam that they
showed."--=l think we prepared our-
selves well for a meet like this

 because there was really no one to

push us except the team itself and

the girls did a good job.” Belowich A

said.

Sophomore Sue Heon had an out-
standing meet. breaking her own
Pitt record in the .l.0()0iyard free-
style with a time of l():l0.36. seven

 f‘u(ll'seeonds faster than her previous.

  

rec id. initheievent.

yThe Lady. Panter divers. under
head coach Julian Krug; alsohad a
field day in the diving events. All

three Pitt divers met the require-
.mcnts for the pre-qualifying meet

for~Nationals. _ A .
Sophomore Lisa Huey and fresh-

man Yvonne Johnston _qualified for_

the pre-national meet on the one-
meter board and. along with senior
Holly Slussaalso qualified for the

pre-national meet »on the three-

meter board._ . L .

Krug was very pleased with the
girl‘s performances. At this point.-he
said. Pitt has three solid. consistent
women divers. ‘

“Lisa did a fine job winning the
one-meter and she also did.one of
her best jobs. including this yekarand

'6‘ I.-7/.¢’.’.-’IIIC’/'

From left to ‘right, Jerry Zales, John Mccrilla, Rickgarter, and Ed LaNove. The
Pitt swimmers qualified for nationals in the 400 Free Relay against Kent state

last year. on the three-meter. l was
also pleased with the way Lisa
bounced back after having trouble
last week at the‘Penn State diving
meet.” Krug said.

‘Krug was also yeryisatisfied with
the winning diving of Sluss on the
thrce—meter event. According to
’Krug. Sluss most _likely would have
met the pre-national requirements
on theone‘-meter board if not for a

mental error in one of her dives. .
/ .

A}good crowd turnedout to rally
behind the Lady Panthers in their
home opener.

“The crowd was great. lt‘s nice to *

see the support. and they were really
appreciated. With tw.o remaining
home meets this season. we will be

hoping forthis same kind of.support

from Pitt fans." Belowich said. “lt
helps."

()n the whole. it seemed the Lady
Panther swimmers and divers _had
an unusually lucky Friday the l3th.i

that will have something to offer

ifhevery Pitt basketball fan. Second-

year (‘oach .ludy Saurer‘s team will
have four of her five starters back

Returning to this year's squad are

For I’itt‘s Men's and Women’s
gymnastics teams. two plus two now
equals one one combined team
victory as Pitt’s four—gymnast con-
tingent captured first place at the
Third Annual 2 plus 2 Keystone
State Invitational Classic.

This is the second consecutive
year that Pitt walked away with the
team trophy. Saturday night”s total
of l62.7() points was l() points ahead
of runner—up Slippery Rock.

For Pitt Senior Bob Besong. Sat;
urday night was a repeat perfor-
mance of last year‘s 2 plus 2 classic.
Besong once again captured the all-
around trophy with an outstanding
total score of 49.5. This was a com-
mendable feat. considering
Besong suffered a minor quadracep
pull during his warm-ups for the
vault.

Pitt tnen‘s Head Coach Fr,anl<
I)’/‘xmico said. “Bobby is not the
type to'complain about injuries:
whenever he does. he really means
it." luckily. the injury did little to
hamper Besong‘s superior
performance;

Also representing Pitt were Frank
Krat/. Holly Martino and Babbie
Flock. ,

The team victory was also high-
lighted by Martino. the women‘s key
performer. She tiegl for third place
with ‘Slippery’ Rock’s Carol Grey in
the all-around competition with a
score at 33.()ti. Ironically. Martino
was not expecting to compete on
Saturday but teammate Karen Mar-
tin severely sprained her ankle in
practice earlier in the week. Martino
was called in as an alternate.

It was Martino‘s first all-around
competition in’ almost a year.

manee. Now I can tell where I am at
and how far I have to go to reach my
goals." Martino said.

The Keystone Classic is a unique

kind of invitational because of the
format. Only two all-around gym-
nasts from each men‘s and women‘s
team compete.

Kratz followed Besong with a
second—place in the all-around com-
petition with a score of 48.9,. Krati
executed several fine routines to
rack up points all night.

“Frank’s ﬂoor exercise routine
was probably the most fluent he has
ever done. He actually dominated
the event." said D‘/Xmico.

“We out—techniqued every other
competitor. and that was my goal."
I)‘/\mico commented. Even with the
sweep of the men’s all-around and
most of the other events. I)‘/\mico
stressed that there‘ was still room for

Krat/ and Besong to improve.
Other than the multitude
mishaps and injuries at the meet
one gymnast broke a leg
I)‘/\mico‘s major gripe about the
meet was with the “unjust“ judging.

"The judging was so bad that
many of our scores varied from two
to three points between judges.“ he
said.

Pitt women‘s Head Coach Donna
Sanft ‘was exceedingly pleased with
the outcome of the meet.

“Both girls kept their composure
and concentration very well. If this
meet is any indication of the future.
the girls may have a dynamite sea-
son.“ said Sanft.

“Holly (Martino) had a great
vaiilt; she got the high score (9.4) of
the event. and she deserved every
part of it." Sanft said.

Rounding out the rest ofthe meet
field were several of Pitt’s familiar
foes West Virginia. Kent Stateand
Eastern Michigan.

Pittsburgh football team isn‘t
given ‘to llights of fancy.

But as a private pilot and
owner of his own plane. he‘s
found a way to get away from the
pressures of his profession and
gain an edge in recruiting.

When he flew to a Pitt booster

meeting in northeastern Pennsyl-

Among them was 280-pound

Mark May.

V “You’ve got to drop some fuel
because of the added weight.”
said Sherrill. “That means you‘\ c
got to stop more often to refuel.”

“But on an off-week I might go

And the craft really becomes
valuable when the season ends
and the recruiting push begins.

“It gives me great flexibility.“
said Sherrill. who does most of
hisiflights across Pennsylvania
and eastern Ohio. '

“You’re talking about a 500-

“Jennifer is an agile. ﬂuent player
for 5"-l0” and is very adept at han-
dling the ball." says Saurer. “She’s

"capable of playing any position."

Saurer also has two promising
freshmen in Lori Lewman and Ste-
phanie Collins. Lewman and Collins
are excellent outside shooters and
are potential threats against_the zone
"defense. ‘ ‘

Junior Lynn Love and sopho-
more Lori Acrent, the only veterans
on the squad other than the starters.
will add much to Pitt’s rebounding
game. Both girls are quite capable of
filling in foi"Miklasevich or Augh-
burns, which should put Saurer’s
mind at ease. '

The ‘schedule includes five of the.
top 20 teams of last year, as well as
the Kansas State Classic, the Pitt
Classic. the LaSalle ‘Tournament
and the Wolfpack doubleheader. V
