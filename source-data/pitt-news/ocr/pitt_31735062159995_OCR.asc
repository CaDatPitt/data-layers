DISCRIMINATION COMMITTEE——-Charges oi discrimination in

some parts of the Pitt scene are being aired by the Student Con-
gress committee shown above. Basketball coach Doc Carlson ﬂat-
ly denied to the committee a statement that Negroes are discrim-

inated against on his teams.

Frosh Take

It All Back;

Ask Return to MC  

Frosh Council wants to come
back to Papa.

Its parent organization, Men’s
Council, was asked to take the
frosh organization back under its
wing by freshman Joe Trattner.

Council also considered a pro-
posal to change its own by-laws,
eliminating a clause which closes
its doors to all students except
members and a Pitt News reporter.
Final action on this will be taken
at the assembly’s next meeting.

Refused Hearing

The clause was brought to light
when Trattner was refused a
hearing at MC’s last meeting,
when he tried to present a “dec-
laration of dependence.”

The freshman organization was

sired by Men’s Council in Sep-
tember, 1950, "to instill better
spirit and organization in the
freshman class,” according to
Richard Cunningham,_ assistant
dean of men and MC advisor. It
was made independent last fall.

Though Trattner succeeded in
getting his hearing, MC members
were still cool toward the idea.
This drew a comment from Prexy
Jack Burwinkle, who said they
were “too calm on such an im-
portant issue.”

Organization Ineffective

The ﬁve-part petition Trattner
presented asked that the fresh-
men again be governed by the
same rules set up when the group

Of D ° ' ' t '

The Student Congress-sponsored committee on brother-
hood continued its investigation of alleged discriminatory
practices on campus in its third and, to date, most con-
troversial session Wednesday afternoon.

The twenty or so men sitting in on the open meeting
heard basketball coach Doc Carlson deny charges made by
an unidentified student that the hoop sport, was closed to

Negroes.

Cyril Wecht, who is chairing the committee, told The News
that his group has “made no charges” and were trying “to find
out exactly what the situation is.”

Carlson declared that Negroes had played on the freshman

teams in the past and that he would welcome at any time any
athlete who would help the team.

Besides
committee:

hearing Carlson,

1. Urged that Student Congress 
a Brotherhood Week '_

back
later in the year;

2. Asked various members of F
the committee to see certain »
ﬁgures to 

administration
gather further facts and to
ascertain University policy;
3. Heard further charges by
students that Heinz Chapel
services during Freshman

orientation week and mar- -

riage services there were re-
spectively sectarian and dis-
criminatory in nature;

4. Debated the pros and cons
of the fraternity and sorori-
ty systems here;

5. Discussed brieﬂy the bulletin
boards, scholarship applica-
tions, and the hiring of fac-
ulty and other University
employees.

Allan Reuben’s suggestion that

the group should urge Congress to

back a Brotherhood Week met with the unanimous approval of the

committee. Reuben called for a

“constructive program” including

class room talks designed “to offer the Pitt student body a ﬁrst hand
experience in understanding brotherhood.”

The rest ‘of the meeting, however, was punctuated by sharp

disagreement.

Jack Greenberg, public relations head of Inter-Fraternity coun-
cil said that IF was considering the matter and welcomed any sug-

gestions.

The Committee again meets next Wednesday :30 through 4:30.
All students are once again invited.

Batchelder Explains New Setup

Registration Change Is Test

By DAVE WINTER
Criticisms of “no— re-re istration” voiced by students
P

in Wednesday’s Pitt News were answered today by a reply
from the University’s assistant registrar, Endicott A. Batch-

elder.

He said:

“Eliminating pre-registration is
just an experiment.”

“We want to try to see if we
can handle the smaller student
body in a regular registration
without all the preliminary work
on the part of students, faculty,
administration and this office.”

Tougher on Administration

“We are not trying to make
registration more difficult,” he con-
tinued, “Because if registration is
jammed up we are the ones who
will work late into the night.”

Answering the objection made
by one student who complained,
“It’s terrible. Now I can't be sure
of getting in the various classes
that I want,” Mr. Batchelder re-
vealed that the registrar’s ofﬁce
has asked all University depart-
ments to tell their faculty to re-
serve cards for students who ex-

t

A press a desire to continue in the

same section.

Pitt never had pre-registration
until 1948, he pointed out. At that
time the veteran enrollment was
highest, swelling the total enroll-
ment to 23,000, approximately
7,000 more students than the pres-
ent'tota1.

Vets Caused Pre-Registration

Pre-registration was hit upon
as a solution after students were
caught in a terriﬁc jam in 1946-47
registrations. At one time during
that year there was a line of peo-
ple four abreast extending from
the Bigelow Blvd. entrance around

the corridor to the Fifth Ave.»

stairs.
“The system was far from per-
fect,” Mr. Batchelder declared.
Though complete kits with
time schedules, study cards, and
administrative oﬁices were mailed

Funds Help Punetured Poclietbooks“

' Cure Homesickness, Clothe ROTC

By IRENE ROZAKIS

for ROTC uniforms are some
loan funds have solved over

There are two such funds now in operation here, one

a sponsored by Men’s Council and¢

the other by WSGA. ‘

From 30 to‘ 50 students each‘
year seek ﬁnancial aid from the
women’s loan fund when unfore-
seen expenses arise or pocket-
books are lost.

Women Borrow Less

Pitt women, according to Dean
Helen P. Rush, seem less inclined
to borrow money ‘than do their
male classmates. , .

One problem that came to the
attention of the women’s fund was
the plight of a homesick girl from
Kansas.

This sad lass felt that she could
ﬁnish the semester in a peaceful
state of mind if she could only see
her mother for a while.

Kansas was too far for her
ﬁnances, so the loan fund prompt-
ly played fairy godmother and lent
her the money to get there.

A great many more students
come to Miss Malin in the dean of
men’s office to borrow from the

The MC Loan Fund was deluged

at the beginning of the semester
with requests for $28 loans. The
reason was soon discovered. The
price of ROTC uniforms was $28.

After his application has been,
approved by Mr. Richard A. Cun-
ningham, assistant to the dean, or
Mrs. Aiken, women’s activities di-

dent may borrow up to $25, and
on rare occasions, more than this
sum. ’

Hopefuls have asked for as
much as $100, but were refused,‘
because the funds are not equipped

Both Charge Interest

Both funds charge interest, the
Men’s Council rate being 25 cents
for-each loan, regardless of size,
and WSGA’s rate set .at two per
cent on every loan, beginning
after the student’s graduation.

The funds seldom have trouble
with bad debts. There are excep-
tions, though, as in the case of the
man who sent ﬁve dollars to the
dean of men’s office a few weeks
ago, asking that it be applied to
his loan. He was “clearing up old
debts,” he said.

Investigation disclosed what the
writer didn’t mention, that this
particular “old debt” was ﬁve

Rehearsals will be Monday from

According to Bea Paul, junior

Never Heard From

After that, although letters were

sent to him, nothing was heard of
the forgetful borrower, until that
terse little note attached to the
five dollar bill arrived.

Most students borrow even
amounts of ten, ﬁfteen, or twenty-
ﬁve dollars, but at least one young
man asked for exactly $56.25.
Startled, Miss Malin asked him if
that extra 25 cents was important.

The student insisted, and, true
to its tradition of service, the MC

We found them in separate

asked one of them about it.

Why Separated?

-“Why,” we asked the cat in the
nearest cage,” are you ‘separated
from your husband (or it may have
been his wife)?”

His answer was terse. “Grrr-
rrrrr,” he snarled, taking a
healthy snap at our copy pencil
which we had rested on a bar
of the cage.

“Why?” we persisted.

“Ah, that other cat’s a boor,” he
said, “we just don’t get along“. Be-
sides, she believes all this stuff
about her being a panther.” He
stopped to lick his chops. “Heck,”
he snarled, “she’s a puma just like
me but she’s too catty to admit it.”

“Is that right?” we asked.

“Grrrrrrr!” he said.

So we moved on to the next
cage. She was quite friendly. “Are
you worried about appearing at

next Saturday?”

Not Worried

“No,” she said, “I’m not worried
at all. I’ll be there all right. But
I don’t know about that other cat
over there. We aren’t talking, you
see.”

“Hmmmmmmm,” we said.

So we hunted out a friendly

us about his charges. “You should

said. “She’s the friendly one." I
can even feed her out of my hand.
That’s why we nicknamed her

“The other one, though . . . ”
He shuddered a bit. “If you tried

he’d chew it off for you.”

Further he told us, “Those cats

out early in December, a survey
last year showed that “less than
50 per cent of the students ﬁlled
out the cards before they came
into the Commons Room,” he
said.

The assistant registrar again re-
peated that one of the main rea-
sons for the “experiment” is'that
many students got class cards they
never used, depriving other stu-
dents of a chance to enter sections.

“No pre—registration” may also
avoid confusion and save cash in
University departments, he ex-
plained. One department with a
false picture from pre-registration
last year even hired an extra in-
structor to help handle an expect-
ed surplus which never material-
ized.

Concluding, Batchelder, said:

“We’re going to listen very
closely to comments of the stu-
dents at registration. Our main
interest is to make the procedure
as smooth as possible.”

Meet, the Clulncellar

. , During his four year stay here the average student
; Frarely, if-ever, gets the opportuntiy to meet with the Chan-
c/ellor on a conversational level. This experience is gen-
jerally reserved for graduation when a brief and perfunctory
. exchange of salutations takes place on the platform.
In an effort to remedy this situation, the Senior Court
 _,of WSGA has joined with the Chancellor in arranging an
open_ house in his ﬁrst ﬂoor offices next Tuesday from 3 to ‘
5 p.m. Both the Chancellor and WSGA have "extended an
invitation to thepstudent‘ body to attend this annual affair.
It is unfortunate that the size of the University mili-'
tates against regular and familiar communication between
us and the Chancellor. Such a relationship would prove
beneﬁcial to both of us and to the University.

& The open house is a step in that direction. We urge
I all of you to take advantage of it. Don’t wait to meet the
Chancellor when you say good-bye to him.

Ana titer Purpose

, The ﬁrst efforts of the brotherhood committee have
stirred up enoughinterest to justify its existence.’ If the nine

‘ men on the committee accomplish nothing. else, they will
at least have succeeded in Brieﬂy lighting a subject which
has long been shrouded in gossip and half-truths.

In addition to seeking out and reporting on the pre-
Valence of prejudice on this campus, the committee can
also render a service to those groups which haveunjustly

A been charged with discriminatory practices. An excellent
opportunity for refuting these accusations is now avail-
able. ' ' ’ I
_ While the committee is holding open meetings there
.will inevitably be many false charges made. If they turn
out to be untrue, they will be identiﬁed as such. The in-
nocent have little to fear. 4

"    ls Birthl Cjontrol Moral?   A

, classes.

First of a~'7‘Se‘ries  

“Birth control is India’s one hope for the fu-
ture.”

It could have been a teacherfrom one of sev-
eral of the University departments—sociology,
economics, philosophy-—-but it was a political sci-
ence instruetor who said it.

It was a matter-of-fact statement, made without

emotion, and the teacher quickly
passed on to his next point with-
out a question being asked or a
hand being raised.

The techniques of birth con-
trol may -not be taught in ‘Pitt
.But th e illustration
above, multiplied and reinforced
by repetition in classesethrough-s
out four college years, is ample .
evidence that teachers and stu- -
dents are passively agreeing or ‘keeping mum on
the birth control question.

Question of Personal Preference .
Birth control is regarded as a popular theory in
Pitt classes, not as a moral‘ question! ,_

’ Under the inﬂuence of the United States’ high
standard of living, it is regarded too often ‘as,
merely a question of personal preference. If you I
want to have ten kids and think you’ll be able to .
support them, okay, but don’t deny the guy who,

 

sits next "to you in class who says he wants— to live

in Mount Lebanon and have two kids spaced five
years apart, using “planned. non‘-parenthood.”
That’s okay, too.’ _

But is it? Have you ever bothered to examine
closely the statements of the disciples of. Mar-
garet Sanger andthe less violent but. just as ef-
fective disciples of the planned society who ignore,
smile at, or distort the moral question?

The’ idea of birth control is not new. Plato
wanted to set up asystem of selective breeding, and 
after the grim forecast of Malthus in the 18th cen-

Tl1ePeop|e's Choice—Dawson

Now that Student Congress has given its okay

‘on Lowell “Red” Dawson, the only thifigelacking

is ofﬁcialconﬁrmation by the Athletic Committee."
Congress joins ‘a long list’ of Dawson supporters,
including a “representative” group of students who
were polled and gave him their unanimous approval.

In other areas the pundits, disdaining, to in-
dulge in partisan expressions, I‘ '
have amassed irrefutable evi-
dence showing that backing or
no backing Dawson is in. A
smile, a smirk, a casual word, a
raised eyebrow--evidence, my
boy. ’_ '

There are of course, a few
diehards who refuse to throw
their weight or minds behind the
popular choice. Probably have .   .
some more irrefutable evidence or they have a
vested interest in someone else.

Pitt’s search for a new man on the Hill has cap-
tured the imaginations of the student and sporting
populations in this part of the Republic. They have
followed the Committee's diligent quest with the
avidity usually, reserved for a televised Congres-
sional probe. ~

Interest is Typically American

This pre-occupation with a inan who will de-
vote his mind and energies.to directing an athletic
organization is typically American. In no other
land on this earth would an a'thletic‘ﬁgure attract
somuch attention and partisan support. And much
of this interest comes from the educated and ruling
classes. I

Not Cake. Just Some

Chances are when you read yourgdaily news-
paper you miss the most interesting and humorous
items in it.

These are the ‘ﬁllers’, the tiny items that editors
throw in at the end of columns
when regular news of a more
sober character doesn’t quite
reach to the bottom of a page.

‘These ﬁllers record some of
the little things that people do in
the course of a day’sliving. Some
of them are rather weird. For
instance:

St. Louis, Mo.——William Thorn- .<;;
ton was carrying no money when he answered a
knock on the door and was confronted by a robber.

But the robber didn’t leave empty-handed. He
reached in Thornton’s pocket and took his false
teeth, valued at $75. A

tury, the idea kept popping up. —
Approximately one-ﬁfth of the Pitt student body
are members of the “no birth control” Roman Cath-
olic Church, at least in name. But few Catholics or
other students. who might be moral objectors have
strong enough opinions on the subject to speak out

when a teacher casually endorses the practice.  ’

The lesser crime in this casual attitude on the
part of teachers and students is that the birth con-
trol question is fostered by casual acceptance.

The big crime is that the moral question is not
even debated! Nobody even asks whether a human ,
being has a right to extinguish or prevent the life
of a child, the natural result of the marriage act. ‘ ‘
Statements Hit News a

Within the space of two months last fall three
signiﬁcant statements on birth .control made news.

(1) On October 20 the director general of the

United Nations World Health Organization agreﬁ~‘~ ' 

to undertake a program of nationwide education*ﬁ-
India on the rhythm method in response to a re-
quest by Prime Minister Nehru. ,

(2) On Oct. 29 Pope Pius XII made a compre-
hensive statement to a congress of Italian obstetri-
cians and midwives outliningin detail the Church’s
stand on birth control. This included the latest/
biological developments—- deliberate sterlization,
and artiﬁcial insemination, concerning which ' he
said, “marriage cannot be reduced to a purely or-
ganic arrangement for the transmission of germs,”'
because it would’ then be reduced" to a simple bio-
logical lab. in ‘

(3) In December a biologist’s convention was .
told that a chemical introduced into the diet of "
pregnant mice had resulted in the resorption of the
fetus, renewing speculation about the September‘
statemerlt of Harvard’s Dr. Conant, which predicted
that by 1961 chemistry may give the human being
the power to prevent God’s design for procreation
by taking a pill! '

Football has ‘been attributed with many virtues‘ A W

and vices. Probably the virtues far exceed the vices.
But itwis questionable that these virtues make any
real contribution to our country, to the ‘world at

that football builds character and for this reason
it is a noble sport. Undoubtably, it has some effect.
on the character,_but this effect is not alwaysgorj
necessarily ‘constructive.

Commercialization Questioned?

, The practice of buying grid stars hashad ta

demoralizing effect on the argument that it lbulildstj I

character. Although some, realists insist that since
this country is overwhelmingly materialistic, the
experience a football star gains in dickering with t
the various schools will be of immeasurable value
to him in later life, especially in business. '
Whatever the importance of football and the
value of the man who runs the team, the fact re-

’mains, that few people would be as perturbed abou _

selecting the Heinz Chapel chaplain or the head of’,
a onelof the University’ departments. These men”.
will,‘ and do, have a direct effect on the minds
of many of the young people who someday. will go P
out of here as citizens. . , « '

But we are a spectator people and I suppose it
is just as natural for us to derive ourmental stirri-
ulation out of another man’s,job prospects as it
is for us to get off our physical steam by rooting
at a football game. A .

On the new man we have adopted a watchful-
waiting policy. We did have a brief ﬂight into the
experting ﬁeld and bet a quarter on—-well, not on
Dawson.

Undefeated-Erapplers
Test Untried Spartans

By DON SCHURMAN
Big-time wrestling comes to the Field House for the sec-

ond time this season tomorrow

night as Rex Peery’s unbeaten,

wrestlers tangle with Michigan ‘State at 8:00 pm. . _
Using the same lineup that last week handed Michigan

its ﬁrst loss_ in eleven dual meets, Pitt will attempt to extend
- a three-meet winning streak and avenge last year’s 18-11, set.

On the other hand, the meet
will be the first of the season for
the young, inexperienced Spar-
tan squad.

Solomon's Record Threatened

With a lineup that includes two
freshmen and four sophomores,
State Coach Fendley Collins be-
moans, “Woeful inexperience, poor
balance, and lack of depth are the

Looking at the Spartans’ NCAA
and National AAU showings,
however, Peery retorts, “They
should be even better than Mich-
igan. They are especially strong
157, 167, and 177
pound classes.” _ 

A The 157-pound class appears to
hold the best possibilities for a
real battle, with Pitt’s undefeated
freshman, Joe Solomon (3-0),
matched against State’s Bob Hoke,-
a National AAU champion last
year.

Pitt’s other undefeated wres-

123-pounds
(3-0); Harold Miller, 130-pounds
(3-0); and Chuck Uram, 147-
pounds (2-0-1)-—‘should have it
easier than Solomon, however.

Peery and Miller face identical
problems in ‘Michigan State’s
freshman twins, 123-pound Bob
Gunner and 130-pound Dick Gun-
ner. Uram, Who drew in his last
outing, takes on an .18-year-old
sophomore, Vito Perrone.

Kane Faces Ex-Footballer

Harvin Krause (1-2),
pounds, and Bud Wise (1-2), 177-
pounds, are matched with the only

‘two seniors on the Spartan squad,

Orris Bender and Ralph Gill.
Wrestling with Michigan State’s
third-place entry in the Big Ten
tournament last year, Bender plac-
ed fourth after ﬁnishing the reg-
ular season with a dismal 3-
mark. .
In the heavyweights, Joe Kane
(1-2) is paired with sophomore
Larry Fowler, a tackle on the
Spartan football team last year.

Unbeaten Fins Resume Action
Against Temple Tomorrow

The Panther swimmers will be in top shape when they

. host Temple Saturday night at the ‘YMHA pool.

Since the 57-27 victory over F&M« in the season opener

5 Coach Ben Grady has been putting his charges through stiff

workouts to offset the long break in the schedule. These
included a practice meet with the YMHA squad last Sat-
urday when Pitt made oﬁ with the honors, 48-36.

The Temple encounter is the
second of the four home meets and
the last appearance until ‘Feb. 9.
Coach Grady appears conﬁdent of

a win over the Owls and probably
has his eye on rugged Navy when
he says, “The Temple meet will
give the boys the hard work they
need to \stand tougher competi-
tion.” Navy is the ﬁrst stop on
Pitt’s ﬁrst road trip.

Last _season the Owls from
Philadelphia ﬁnished with a rec-
ord of ﬁve wins and three losses,
including a 59-16 trouncing at the
hands of the local crew. _

For the Pitts it will be their

West Virginia boasts an im-

BY DON MURDOCK
Sports Editor
_Will Lowell “Red” Dawson be Pitt’s next football coach?
If yes, then why the delay in naming him so?

Dawson, the only man to be interviewed twice by
the Athletic Committee, seems to have the inside track
for the vacant post, but does he have the job cinched?

One thing Dawson is satisﬁed and well-liked at Michi-
gan State. For another, if head coach Biggie Munn would
decide to move up to Athletic Di-O-

rector, then Dawson would be-
come the logical choice for the ex-
cellent job at State where facili-

.ties are so much better than at

Pitt.
Alumni Wants Alumnus
If Dawson came to Pitt he
would be giving up his chance of
remaining in the Big Ten, which
packs plenty of authority in col-
legiate football in the United
States.
The alumni want an alum-
nus. Captain Hamilton’s per-
sonal choice is Dawson.

Biff Glassford, an alumnus who
has been mentioned for the post,
inherited a strong Nebraska team
two years ago and produced. This
year on his own he failed to sat-
isfy.

Hamilton Being Cautious

Another alumnus is John Mich-
elosen, ousted" coach of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers.

From there the list of alumni
thin into-practically nothing.

Which goes to prove that the
ﬁeld of alumni is weak. And that
Hamilton has to be cautious about
the matter since his choice before

was Len Casanova, who wasted a
year installing the T formation
and then left for the West Coast.

Michelosen in Running

If Dawson is _the man, then why
hasn't he been picked?

It would have been so much
easier on the University if the
choice had been given before the
NCCA meetings in Cincinnati.
The assistant coaches would have
known where they stood, the
football players would have
known what was up, and most
important several promising high
school prospects who graduate in
February would have been en-
couraged or otherwise to attend
Pitt. _-
The most important group of .
athletic men at Pitt——the alurrmi
-is in favor of Michelson for the
job if he can teach the T. Mich-
elosen says he can, having ex-

while coaching in the service.
And the Spartans weren’t en-

that Michelson—the alumni choice

defense that held the highest scor-
ling team in the country to only
three ﬁelders in the ﬁrst half and.
13 more during the second half.

“We played a zone”, he happily
related, “with Burch and myself
covering the ball in the back
court. But we had to watch the.
pivot closely to keep their big men
from getting the ball.”

Pitt Controlled Boards

Carlson modestly stated that
“we were ﬁghting and driving
hard.” But, the Pitt defensive play
was more than that.

Virostek and Art Boyd con-
trolled their own boards as well as
their opponent’s. As a result Pitt’s
fast break accounted for half of
its ﬁeld goals.

Midway through the third
period the Panthers held a com-
manding 30 point lead, 49-19,-—
quite impressive for a deliberate
possession team.

thedral Gymnasium.

Two-hour sessions starting at
4:00 have been thrown open to

the staff since cancellation of the _

basketball meetings.

John Kendrick, captain of Doc Carlson’s bas-
ketball team, is a good example of a player who
would have gained more fame if he had failed
a grade or two while in grammar school.

Kendrick just doesn’t seem to be around the
court when the ﬁreworks really get hot.‘ In high
school and in college the pattern has been the
same for the Pitt ﬂoor leader.

As a senior member of the Aliquippa' high
hoop team, Kendrick and‘ his teammates partici-
pated in the WPIAL tourney. His team lost to
Duquesne, 46-36, that year, but the following sea-
son the Quips—minus Kendrick——-won the state
title.

No Frosh Squad
At Pitt Kendrick really became a Johnny-come-

early. The freshman cage candidates were with-5

out a frosh team to learn the diﬂicult Carlson
continuity system and once more Kendrick punch-
ed the clock too soon.

When Athletic Director Tom Hamilton took
over here the following year, the Panthers ﬂoor-
ed one of their best frosh quintets since the war.

Now a senior, John has climaxed his 3-year
stay in‘ the role of ﬂoor leader.

Expects To Enter Army

Last year as one of Carlson’s more reliable
subs, Kendrick’s scoring totaled 82 points on 29
ﬁelders and 24 foul shots. Already this season
John has dumped 62. points and his percentage
from the ﬁeld is a lusty .382.

This year’s team, ranks with the best of the
post—war era but both Carlson and Kendrick con-
ﬁdently predict even a better squad next season.

John, though, will probably be marching for
Uncle Sam’s outﬁt next year.

. Enjoyed Columbia Win

Although Kendrick did not make last season’s
western trip during the Christmas recess he saw
considerable action as a junior to earn his second
numeral.

Kendrick’s greatest thrill arose from Pitt’s
great upset victory in the Field House opener when
Columbia—riding on a 32-game winning streak-
was on the short end of the score, 65-64.

MARK WORKMAN holds the
free throw WVU record’ with 159
points scored from the foul line
last year. Fred Schaus previously
held the mark -with 134 free
throws, established in 1949.

133 Exhausted Student Teachers
Look Forward to End of Training

By PAULINE GRUBER
On Jan. 18, 133 Pitt seniors will complete 20 weeks of
the most practical but most hectic training they have ever

received.

Last September these education’ majors stepped into their

classrooms and exchanged theii$

Vade Macums or Compasses for a
teacher‘s guidebook.

Under the guidance of an ex-
perienced critic teacher and a
supervisor from Pitt, these stu-
dents have been teaching classes
ranging from kindergarten to
high school seniors. They have
been putting into use the theories
they learned in their classes at
the University.

Lots of Problems

These embryo teachers have
many problems to face in their
classroom work. One young man
spent three weeks helping two
fourth grade boys learn that
“fighting it out” was not the best
way to solve a disagreement.

A very short young lady teach-
ing“ high school German has a
problem all her own. Many of her
senior boys are much taller than
she. “I just have to look up to
them.”

Most student teachers spend
many hours outside the classroom
preparing for their teaching. They
must plan their lessons, make up
tests, correct and grade papers

  

   

 
   
     
  
  

'-kl?

   

can an V\““"$ ‘O3

and keep many records. This, add-
ed to the assignments they receive
in their other classes at the Uni-
versity, means long hours of work.

There is also a funny side to
student teaching. As one student
put it, “You are sure to get at
least one laugh a day.”

Vvatches Romances

One first grade teacher enjoys
watching the romances of her
young pupils. When one little boy
kissed his little girl friend in
class, however, she felt that it was
going just a little too far.

An excuse for absence re-
ceived by a third grade teacher
gave her a laugh. It read:
“Please excuse Gary because he
had a stomach.”

One young man who has a Very
feminine critic teacher was
startled when one of his fifth
graders asked: “Are you Miss
. . . . . . . . . ..’s husband?” Despite
his denials the child is still con-
vinced that they are secretly mar-
ried.

' Better For It
Most student teachers believe

ACCO CO-

7

that they have benefited greatly
by their experiences in student
teaching, but they are not sorry
that it will soon be over.

One tired looking man sum-
med it up with: “It was fun and
I liked it a lot, but it sure was
work.” Then he added: “I think
I’ll really appreciate my classes
at the university better after
having some practical experience.

I’ll appreciate student teaching
more, too, when I’m on my own.”

Architects Talk
To Arts Group

The Fine Arts Society has an-
nounced that the speakers at its
next meeting will be Mildred
Schmertz and George Patton, de-
signers and architects in the Pitts-
burgh area.

Miss Schmertz and Patton re-
cently returned from a tour of
Europe and will speak of their
travels. Color slides of European
art monuments accompany the
talk.

The meeting will be held Jan.
15 at 8 p.m. in the Photograph
Study room on the seventh ﬂoor.

was founded, explaining that their
organization “had been ineffective
and hardly represents the fresh-
man class.”

Backing the request for re-ad-
mittance, ex-frosh council mem-
ber Dan Purdy said: “Many mem-
bers of Freshman Council are po-
tential student leaders and want
to get into activities. It is our job
to help them out.”

Motion Tabled

A motion by Ronald Ecker tab-
ling the discussion until next week
was passed.

In other business, the senior
council also appointed the four
chairmen of the fall orientation
program and Cunningham to a
committee which will select up-
perclass counselors. Al Johnson
also reported that so far only
eight checks have been handled
at the Student Desk check-cash-
ing depot.

Nurse Workshop Set

Pitt’s school of nursing will
hold a two-week workshop course
on Fundamentals of Industrial
Nursing beginning Monday, Jan
14.

“The object of the workshop is?

to help nurses learn how to use
their nursing ‘skills within the
industrial ‘ organizations,” ex-
plained Miss G. Walters, assistant
professor of nursing.

Lab Sports Trio
Of Noisy Roosters

Wonderin‘ about a rooster’s

The “cock-a-doodle doo’s”
echoing in the elevator shafts
come from a trio of roosters in

Dr. R a l p h Biichsbaum,

which the roosters play an
important role.

“The roosters furnish blood

Roosters, rather than hens are
