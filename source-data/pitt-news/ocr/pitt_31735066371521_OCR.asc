  Olympic walkout by

Soviets stuns athletes

By Lisa B. Keer
Staff Writer

Many Pitt professors and student-
athletes were stunned by the Soviet
Union’s decision, announced yester-
day, not to participate in the 23rd
Olympiad in Los Angeles this
summer.

The Soviets said the decision, the
culmination of ongoing friction
between their Olympic committee
and American authorities, was
based upon inadequate security for
their athletes in Los Angeles.

Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, reported that the United
States “does not intend to ensure the
security of all athletes, respect their
rights and human dignity, and create
normal conditions for holding the
Games.”

The United States, in response,
yesterday denounced the decision as

“a blatant political action for which ‘

there is no justification.”
Robert Donnorummo, associate
director of the Russian and East
European Studies Program at Pitt,
suggested a broader explahation for
the move.
He cited the way the American
media tend to “embarrass” the

Soviets when reporting on defectors .
and the general anti-S oviet feeling in
this country among possible
explanations. ,

“The most important reason may
be the use ofthe Olympics as a politi-
cal tool. We used it as a political
tool, however honorable it was,
when we pulled out of the I980
Summer Olympics in Moscow. It
was a political move.”

Political science professor R onald
H. Linden, director of the program,
agreed.

“They were looking for an oppor-
tunity to politically embarrass the
U.S. like we embarrassed them in
I980.“

Another concern was whether
other Eastern blocnations would
join the Soviets and withdraw from
the Olympics as well. A

“It will be interesting to see who
does and doesn't," Linden said. “I
would be surprised if the East Ger-
mans follow the Soviet lead. It is a
political ‘move, but like the U.S.
asked of the other democratic
nations in 1980, the Soviets may do
now.”

Some Pitt athletes, such as Olym-
pic hopeful Roger Kingdom, agree
with the revenge theory.

Ex-envov concludes

, “That’s exactly what it looks like,
but all they’re really doing is hurting
the athletes," said Kingdom, who
competes in the l 10-meter high hur-
dles. “They’re the ones who suffer
the most. They should keep politics
out of the Games.”

Kingdom said that hurdlers won't

be affected to the same extent as’

other athletes. The U.S. team, he
said, features the world’s top con-
tenders in the hurdling events.

“If I win a medal, I'll know I was
competing against the best in the
world."

Marathon runner Don Freedline,
a graduate stu‘-dent in physiology at
Pitt and an Olympic hopeful, is
offended that such a drastic decision
must affect -the innocent athletes.

“It seems a shame that it had to
happen,” Freedline said. “It
dampens the who-le thing for all the
athletes involved."

All of the athletes unfortunately .

are caught in a purely political strug-
gle, Linden commented. A’

“If this type of behavior keeps
going," Linden said, “the modern
Olympics will dwindle down to
nothing.”

Lebanon needs newarmy

By Mark A. Slndler
Staff Writer

When Richard Parker, former
U.S. ambassador to Lebanon,
emphasizes the need for national
reconciliation in that troubled
Mideast country, his solution for
peace remains the same today as
when he served under the Carter
Administration in 1977-78. .

Parker’s lecture last night in
Forbes Quadrangle, “The Tragedy
in Lebanon,” stressed the need for
an integrated, unified army in
Lebanon.

“Divide the place up vertically or
horizontally and distribute the pow-
ers. The principal problem is what to
do with the army," Parker said.
“Christians don't want Moslems in
their sector, just as Moslems don’t
want Maronites in theirs.

“You need a desegregated, unified
army. It remindsme of the Ameri-
can, Constitutional Convention,
where people hadto make conces-
sions and hang togetheri”

Lebanon is currently forming a
new government under Rashid
Karme, whom Parker calls “an old
politician from Tripoli."

National reconciliation among
the estimated I6 religious sects
neared realization during Parker‘s
tenure, but he blamed Carter’s lack
of action as leading to
disintegration.

“In the beginning, we accomp-
lished something in terms of prom-
oting an atmosphere in which
national reconciliation was possi-
ble," he said. “The reason it fell apart
is that Syria was able to exploit the
differentiation of various factions.
Really, though, everybody assisted
in miscalculations."

Principally, Parker accused Car-
ter of not bearing down strongly
enough on Israel after it invaded
southern Lebanon in, 1978 and
refused to let Syria restore order.
“The situation kept festering," he
said, as the Israelis also didn’t place

their trust in Christian ally Major

Richard Parker, former ambassador to Lebanon

Haddad. _

In the end, the U.S. was unwilling
to bring enough pressure on the F
lsraelis to move, Parker asserted,
which later led to Syria’s intense sus-
picion of Israel. This became clear
after lsrael’s 1982 invasion of
Lebanon, designed to sweep the
Palestinian Liberation Organization
out of the south. '

“On the one hand, the Carter
Administration was very anxious to
do something then,” Parker said.
“On the other, it was unwilling to
put pressure on Israel when it
needed to. The Carter Administra-
tion bears a share of the responsibil-
ity because it was not strong-minded
enough in its day."

Nowadays, Parker commends
President Reagan for pulling the
U.S. Marines out of Lebanon in
February after a l7-month stay.
“We had no alternative," he con-
tinued. “The position became unte-
nable as soon as we became involved
in the fighting [in September l983].
We can no longer be considered
peacekeepers as long as we were
identified as being on a certain side.“

Parker said he believes Lebanon

will never again enjoy the prosperity
it did under Maronite domination
prior to 1975, when the country
maintained the Arab world’s highest
standard of living. He predicted a
narrow set of options for the

. country.

“The question is, can you have a
new arrangement? The only one
with a chance of working is a form of
federal canton as in Switzerland
today, a federal republic," Parker
explained. “You must also give more
power to the groups heretofore
excluded, especially the Shia.”

Ever since Parker replaced Frank
Malloy, who was assassinated, he
has been especially aware of the fra-
gile balance among the numerous
religious sects in Lebanon.

He described his own role as “like
Abe Lincoln‘s ~ there to bind up the
wounds."

It will take more than that,
though, he said. “For all the years
l’ve understood Lebanon,“ Parker
said, “I am impressed with how diffi-
cult it is to find a radical solution.
When people try to cut through it,
they tend to cut their fingers at the
same time."

Pitt opens atom center

With equipment worth over $l million donated by United States
Steel, Pitt‘s School of Engineering has established the largest atom
probe facility in the world. I

The facility will enable scientists to study the structure and chemis-
try of metals and semiconductors at very high magnifications, provid-
ing information necessary for understanding the behavior and
characteristics of these materials. ,

The equipment includes four field-ion microscope atom probes,
instruments that permit the location of individual atoms in solids and
chemically identifies specific atoms or molecules.

For the past three years, Pitt and researchers at United States Steel
have worked on a National Science Foundation-supported project on
alloys. The research has already won a Creativity Award from the
foundation.

The facility, which will be located in Benedum Hall, is expected to
be fully operational by this summer, and the school has advanced
$100,000 dollars to relocate and install the equipment.

Professors S. Sidney Brenner and William A. Soffa of the depart-
ment of metallurgical and materials engineering will coordinate the
laboratory. The facility will provide graduate students the opportu-
nity to use the instrumentation in thesis work.

M.D. gets prevention award

The National Mental Health Association last Friday presented its
I983 Lela Rowland Prevention Award to Dr. Elsie Broussard, direc-
tor of the Infant-Family Resource Program at Pitt's Graduate School

, of Public Health (GSPH). The award acknowledges the nation’s

outstanding program in preventing mental or emotional disabilities,
and Pitt‘s was chosen above 26 others from across the country.
The Infant-Family Resource Program spans two decades. In 1963,
Broussard began her work with a study of- healthy Pittsburgh first-
born infants. From these studies, she learned more about infant
development and the parenting process as well as the nature of psy-
chosocial disorders. ‘A '

In 1973, this research project received the American Psychiatric A

Association's I-Iofheimer Award for outstanding research. Broussard

and her colleagues have pioneered in developing ways to provide A

preventive-intervention services to infants and their families.
Broussard is a professor of public health psychiatry in the Depart-
ment of Health Services Administration at GSPH and an associate
professor of child psychiatry in the department of psychiatry at the
School of Medicine. ‘

Pitt counselor wins award

Robert P: Gallagher, director of the University Counseling and
Student Development Center, was awarded the Outstanding Leader-
ship Award by the American College Personnel Association last
month. ‘

The award is given to the person making the most significant
contributions to student development through the association.

As president of the Pennsylvania College Personnel Association,
Gallagher is credited with helping bring about a 50 percent increase in.
association membership, a series of eight regional workshops and a
new statewide mailing labels program for over 2,000 student affairs
professionals.

Gallagher is on the Board of Directors of the International Associa-
tion of Counseling Services, the vice-chairperson for Task Force
Commision XV (Legal Issues) of the American College Personnel
Association ‘and the chairperson of a national task force on legal issues
in mental health inliigher education. J

  Scientific Day set for Friday

Pitt’s School of Medicine will hold its annual Student Scientific
Day Friday at 2 p.m. at Scaife Hall.

Student research presentations and awards will highlight the event.
Kevin Gingrich will receive the 1. Arthur Mirsky Memorial Award for
outstanding individual research conducted while in medical school.
Samuel Tisherman will be awarded the American Heart Association
Undergradute Prize for original research pertaining to the cardiovas-
cular system.

WPGH to get new board

A new media board will supervise
Pitt’s campus radio station begin-
ning in September. The current
nine-member Publications and

Media Board, which oversees The
Pitt News and Panther Prints, for-
merly advised WPGH AM64.

Station program director Chris-
topher Kramer said that Conney
Kimbo, the vice-chancellor of stu-
dent activities, suggested the separ-
ate board’s inception last
September, when the station
received its FCC license to go FM
starting this fall. A

With the dial change will come
increased amounts of money.

“We knew last September when
we got the construction permit that
we’d be switching," Kramer said.

The radio station will have a
larger budget to offset increased
costs in new equipment and station
upkeep, among others.

Members have yet to be named to
the new board. which Kramer said
will ensure greater on—air
responsibility.

“There’s going to be a bigger
responsibility more than anything,"
he said. “We will be more readily

area. Plus we’ll fall under more FCC
regulations —— tons and tons of regu-
lations that don’t come near the
amount. evident with the print
media." , \

-.

Whereas the Publications and
Media Board is dominated by print-
affiliated members, the new board
will consist of station members,
community-affiliated broadcasters,
one Publications and Media Board
member and others.

“The board did need more people
who are in the non-print media,"
Kramer said. “With the new board,
the current media board still wanted

something to do with it. They will i

have representation.”

The station, which hasn't released
its call letters or dial number yet, will
be I0 watts strong after its transmit-
ter is installed this summer. The
FCC granted the new license Sept.
28.

New program at Pitt

Occupational therapy thrives

By Laurie Kubll
Staff Writer

This is National Occupational
Therapy Week, and for the first time
in Pitt‘s history, the School of
Health Related Professions has a
bachelor’s degree program in occu-
pational therapy.

Occupational therapy, often
referred to as “OT,” is not to be con-
fused with vocational rehabilitation
or physical therapy, although they
are closely linked. “Just don’t ask us
to define it,” laughed Debbie Brend-
linger, one of 29 students now in the
OT program.

According to the American Occu-
pational Therapy Association,
which has chapters in every state and
isbased in Rockville, Md., “Occupa-
tional therapy is a vital health care
service which uses ‘occupation,’
meaning purposeful activity, as a
means of preventing, reducing or
overcoming many physical, social
and emotional disabilities in people
of all ages."

“OT is appropriate for all ages,
from infancy to geriatrics,”
explained Chris Wolfe, one of the
three staff members in Pitt’s pro-

, gram. “It is an in-depth analysis of

therapeutic activities, such as work,
self-care and leisure activities. Man-
ual testing, which the students are
studying now, and goriiometry [joint
measurement] are some of the tests
used to assess the level of joint
motion and muscle strength.”

Wolfe explained that an occupa-
tional therapist can work to facili-
tate physical development in
premature babies and infants at risk.
“We see what position is best for
their development and in streng-
thening certain reflexes, and we
decide what sensory input is good
for them.”

OT is not only physically
oriented, although rehabilitation is a
primary focus, according to pro-
gram staff member Ardi McDer-
mott. “There's a lot of psychiatry,"
said McDermott. “We deal with

physical disabilities, perceptual-I

motor problems in children and psy-
chiatry, although it’s mostly
rehabilitation.”

‘‘It’s important to integrate psy-
chosocial and physical aspects of an
individual’s life, ” McDermott said.

One student, Wendy Nice, said
she would like to work in a rehabili-
tation center for the challenge of
dealing with a variety of disabilities.
“The main goal is [for the patient] to
achieve independent functioning.”

Some of the OT students are
involved in a program within the
Generations Together office at Pitt,
called Youth In Service To Elders,
or YISTE. The students spend a
couple of hours per week at the older
individual’s home, helping him or
her to maintain an independent lifes-
tyle. Marie Barko calls her endeavor
“sort of like an out-patient care."

Gus Takson is the program’s only
male student this term. He came
from Hawaii to attend Pitt. Takson

holds a bachelor’s degree in econom-
ics. and he tried to get into physical
therapy school at Pitt and elsewhere
but says he is happy in OT.

Wolfe believes that the main dif-
ference between physical and occu-
plational therapy is in “the

ment. OTs and PTs work closely
together,” Wolfe said. “PTs exercise
for strength and mobility improve-
ments, and OTs apply them to
homemaking skills, work and the
like. Frequently, we have the same
goals.” /

tain that the lack of students in the

minimum QPA of 2.50, with
nothing under a C in prerequisite
courses. Applicants must also pass
proficiency exams in five craft areas.
such as leatherwork, copper-tooling
and macrame.

Students accepted begin in the
summer session following their
sophomore year and attend full-time
in the fall and winter. They take two
classes in the spring session, then
return in the fall to finish course-
work. The remaining two terms are
for field work; three months are
spent with a physically disabled per-
son, and another three are spent
with a mentally disturbed
individual.

“There is something like a 60 per-
cent rise in the need for OTs," said
Brendlinger, who is undecided
about what kind of job she would
like to get when she graduates.
“There is a big demand in the area
because this is the first program
here.” She went on to note that there
are many OTs in the area who
obtained degrees elsewhere.

“The Rehabilitation Institute [of
Pittsburgh] has 14 OTs and attracts
people from all over the country,"
Brendlinger noted. “Harmarville
[Rehabilitaitori Center] has around
30 OTs."

Amy Plenderleith, another OT
student, summed up the program.
“OT combines the physical aspects
of medicine with the psychosocial
aspects of the person. You’re learn-
ing the basics like anatomy, physiol-
ogy and kinesiology, but you also
have a broad base in the social scien-
ces. The OT philosophy sees a per-
sons leisure, work and activities of
daily living as all being important.”

PortAuthority
ofter student 3;
do we care?

The Port Authority of Allegheny
County has recently proposed three
transfer policy changes. The new
transfer policy would feature the fol-
lowing proposals:

0The maximum time for which a
transfer would be valid would be
reduced from three hours to two
hours; however, the round~trip priv-
ilege would be retained.

OThe patron would be required to
surrender the transfer upon its use.
The patron would be permitted to
purchase another transfer for 25
cents.

0The current provision allowing

\ the issuance of free transfers with

U-Tickets would be abolished.

' Transfers with U-Tickets would cost

25 cents like other transfers.

According to PAT spokesper-
sons, these changes are designed to
limit the potential for abuse of the
transfer. It seems that a lot of people
were making round trips on one

transfer rather than paying another

fare for the return trip home. Appar-
ently, this practice was widespread
and the loss of revenue substantial
enough to examine the policy. And
this is OK —— a transfer should not be
a carte blanche invitation to ride the
transportation system while paying
only one fare.

But take a good look at the third
proposal. Why is this change also
necessary? PAT has already pro-
posed two changes to eliminate the
abuse of transfer privileges, so how
does raising the price of transfers to
students further serve this goal?

It doesn’t! The only reason for this
change is to increase revenues at the
expense of students already strug-
gling to make ends meet. This
increase will cost commuting stu-
dents having to use transfers an
additional $10 a month. In a period
of diminishing student aid availabil-
ity and increasing tuition rates, this
increase would further harm the
already precarious ﬁnancial posi-
tion of many commuting students in
the Pittsburgh area.

What is amazing is that this is the
first time most _of you have even
heard about this fare increase —
which is why PAT chose the student
sector of the community to bear the
burden of increasing their coffers.
They figured that either students
don’t read the papers, wouldn’t read

Letters :

a fare proposal or wouldn’t mobilize
even ifthey did. And they were right.

The Port Authority Board is hav-
ing a public hearing at the David
Lawrence Convention Center on
Wednesday, May 9th, where I have
been allowed five minutes to present
my views on the proposal’s effect on
student finances. To my knowledge,
no other student or student organi-
zation (including our own Student
Commuter Association) has
reserved time to voice student feel-
ings. So I don’t have my hopes up.

Although it is too late to testify at

the hearing, it is not too late to write '

a brief note to the board. It doesn't
have to be long ——just let them know
you’re out there. Mail it to:

Jason Fincke
PATransit
2235 Beaver Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA 15233

Many of the area school adminis-
trators I have contacted have enthu-
siastically agreed to write to the
board objecting to the increase. So if
they are willing to take thetime, so
should you -— very quickly. If you
don’t. don't complain when your
wallet feels a little lighter next
semester.

Administration
must reject
terrorism now

The Reagan administration has
recognized terrorism as a legitimate
weapon of covert war. In the past,
this tactic has been abhorred by civ-
ilization. The reason terrorism has
been at all successful as an intimidat-
ing policy is that it is such an unac-
ceptable abomination. By
constricting the emotional sensitiv-
ity of sensible people, it attracts the
attention of the press and media. A
limited success, albeit.

Civilized countries have abso-
lutely nothing to gain from terror-
ism. The attention we generate
works against the spirit of coopera-
tion that is the most important offer-
ing we make to the pretensions and
hostility of countries like Libya.
Withholding cooperation in eco-
nomic affairs and diplomatic ties
should be our response to senseless
violence.”

In Central America, where civili-
ans live under constant danger from
leftist guerrillas, the United States is
setting no example for the people to
turn to for insight. If our approach is
muscle diplomacy and belligerence,
the outcome will be war. If, on the
other hand, our approach is demo-
cratic, so will be the outcome.
Sooner or later, we must begin to act
on the faith of our principles.

By financing terrorism in Nicara-
gua, America is joining the ranks of
rank governments whose philo-
sophy of man’s potential is bleak. In
a civilized country, it is a shame to

forfeit the works of optism and pro-
forfeit the works of optimism and
nrogress to cynicism and aggression.

The Reagan administration
should renounce terrorism, begin-
ning by recanting George Schultz‘
statements in Time magazine. If the
administration fails to rectify its
blindly wrong position ‘and con-
tinues to export violence, the citi-
zens of this country should renounce
this administration in the autumn
elections. Terrorism succeeds when
civilization falters.

Examining genius:
Fassbinders crowning
achievement comes

to Pittsburgh
By use Lovalle
And Michael Selz

Pittsburgh filmgoers can be wit-
ness to a one-of-a-kind experience
later this month. All they need do is
be willing to sit in a darkened room
for 15 and a half hours over the
course of four evenings beginning
May 20. They’d be told a grand and
powerful story of an ex-convict,
armed with the best intentions, who
is reduced to despair and desolation
in l920’s Berlin.

“Berlin Alexanderplatz,”a film by
Rainer Werner Fassbinder, was first
produced for fourteen one-hour seg-
ments on West German television in
l980. It is based on the novel of the
same name written by Alfred Doblin
in 1929. *-

Fassbinder was the enfant terrible
of West German film. His value has
always been disputed by his own
countrymen and his status as the
premier contemporary German

' filmmaker has only been accorded

him by French and American reac-
tion to his work. West Germany has
always been the last to concede it.
“Berlin Alexanderplatz" is no
exception. The airing of the film on
West German television was moved
to a later hour after several of the
segments received heated criticism

from film critics ‘and religious
groups. They complained that it was
sordid and self-indulgent and not
suitable for children.

What was criticism, though, may
just have been trepidation. Fass-
binder was a perennial threat to
West Germany’s historical amnesia.
Artists in West Germany have for
decades appointed themselves the
archivists of their society, making
sure Germany never forgets the

Holocaust and the" climate that’

made it possible. In‘ many of his 30-
odd films, Fassbinder depicted the
Germany that Germans would
sooner forget. The past was not
pretty, but Fassbinder looked it full
in the face. g_

Upon its premiere in the United
States last summer, the film, was
heralded with almost unilateral
praise. Vincent Canby of The New
York Times called it “a huge and
magnificent melodrama, a new kind
of narrative cinema." Susan Sontag
went so far as to call it “a new art
form” — an adaptation that met and
transcended the novel on which it
was based. _

Fassbinder died on June I0, 1982,
and though he completed several
films after this one, it may ultimately
be considered his crowning achieve-
ment. I

, “Berlin Alexanderplatz” is the
story of Franz Biberkopf, released
from Berlin’s Tegel prison in l928
after serving a four-year sentence for
the accidental killing of his prosti-
tute lover. Vowing to be “strong and
decent,” Franz goes back to the
Alexanderplatz, the working-class
Berlin neighborhood he lived in
before‘ his prison term. He takes on
various odd jobs, becoming a tie
clasp vendor, newspaperman for a
rightist Nazi press and a shoelace
saleman. At last, convinced of the
dubious prospects of making money
in these ways, he innocently falls in
with a group of thieves, losing his
right arm and his resolve to stay
“honest" while playing an unwitting
accomplice to a robbery.

Franz is demoralized by the loss
of his arm, and totally certain now of
his inability to make money legiti-
mately. He takes up drinking, arm-
chair politics and fencing stolen
goods for a pimp.

Having ﬂirted for years with proc-
uring prostitutes, but mostly allow-
ing himself to be supported by them,
Franz takes in a child-woman of
astonishing beauty, , the young
Mieze, played by Barbara Sukowa.
Unknown to the still-naive Franz,
she supports him by prostitution.
They love each other passionately,
however, and when he does find out
her profession, it turns out not to
matter. When tragedy hits yet
another time, Franz’ downfall is
quickened.

Franz Biberkopf is struck down

repeatedly by misfortune, but

blames fate instead of the wretched-
ness of the world and people around
him. In a conversation with death
near the end of the film, Franz is
rebuked: “You didn’t open your

' eyes. How can you judge humanity

with your eyes closed  You musn’t
honor it as fate. You must look at it,
grasp it, destroy it.” But in the end, it
is he that is destroyed.

Fassbinder had wanted to adapt
Doblin’s novel for many years.
According to a New York Times
interview with Juliane Lorenz, a film
editor who had lived with Fass-
binder during the last three years of
his life, “[Fassbinder] had read it 14
or 15 times and wrote the screnplay
in three months. It was crazy. He
had it all in his mind.”

Fassbinder’s decision to make the
film in 14 parts, plus an epilogue, for
television was a concession made
only to maximize the budget($6 mil-
lion) ‘and the film’s length. The

SUNDAE

Entertainment

   

shooting was completed in 200 days.
It is noteworthy that so bold and
ambitious an undertaking had a
budget and schedule that were min-
uscule compared to Hollywood
monoliths of similar scope.

“Berlin Alexanderplatz" reflects
Fassbinder’s habitual concern with
the powerless underclass of German
society —— as Doblin put it, those
people “who ask more of life than a
piece of bread and butter." The film
does not glorify the decadent 1920s
of Berlin; rather, it paints a picture
that is cold, desolate and hopeless.

Bringing home the brutish impo-
tence of humanity time and again,
Fassbinder inserts footage of
slaughterhouses and the butchering
of sheep, with no apparent narrative
connection to the story. Franz says
at one point with uncharacteristic
certainty, “l’m nothing but an
animal to be slaughtered.” The nar-

rator gives counts at odd intervals of -

the number of animals slaughtered
in Berlin in 1928, and then the
number of human deaths in that
same year. He asserts, “Man is like
the beasts. As they die, so does he.”
In “Berlin Alexanilerplatz,” Fass-
binder‘s Germany is the slaughter-
house and Franz just one of the
innocent, unsuspecting sheep wait-
ing to be butchered.

E] E El

Franz, played magnificently by
the German actor Gunter Lam-
precht, is an overweight, doughy-
looking man with small, soft eyes.
He has a sweetness that inspires loy-
alty in the many women of his life.
Lamprecht and Gottfried John as
Franz’ stuttering, evil friend Rein-
hold are relative newcomers to Fass-
bind,er’s direction; almost all the
others are veterans of the filmmak-
er‘s stock company. Hanna Schy-
gulla, Elisabeth Tressenaar, Barbara
Sukowa and Brigitte’ Mira have
worked with Fassbinder frequently
in the past.

The photography by Xaver
Schwarzenberger is effective and
stunning. The film is dark and soft-
focused with faces highlighted from
the side like paintings by Rem-
brandt. There are lots of neon lights
coming through the windows, in
Franz’s neighborhood. pub, in his

emerge from where they shouldn't.
The camera will focus on a charac-
ter, switch to another, and swing
back to the first, but at the opposite
end of the room. He has traversed
the room in a mere second or two.

Fassbinder commented on these
techniques, “I don’t want to create
realism the way it's usually done. It’s
a collision between film and the sub-
conscious that creates a new real-
ism." By making an audience aware
of the process of ﬁlmmaking with
this continual jarring of sensibilities,
they do not simply feel the story;
they are forced to think as well.

The film employs the grand ges-
turing and exaggerated facial
expressions of silent film and melo-
drama. While the actors’ emotions
ring true, their overblown posturing
keeps us apart, reminding us it’s a
film. ln this aspect too, a new con-
cept of cinematic realism is
communicated. "

E] El Cl

Whenever a novel is adapted for
the screen, some measure of com-
plexity and subtlety is sacrificed in
the trading of words for images. This
is to be expected, of course, as there
is no way of conveying all the mean-
ing of several hundred pages in an
hour and forty—five minutes of film.

“Berlin Alexanderplatz” explodesw

all notions of proper length in order

~ to offer the viewer both uncommon

depth as well as evocative imagery.
This ‘cake and eat it too’ notion is
why this film can be looked upon as
a new art form. This film is dense
and unrelenting without apologies.
“Berlin Alexanderplatz” is atgthe
very least a rich and engrossing
drama. At most it will transform our

expectations of cinema. Somehow,

it can pull the viewer in and holds
him back at the same time. While its
unwieldy length may keep it from
attracting a wide audience, the film
stands as the prototype of a new,
more ambitious cinema.

If you were hooked by their
debut, The Crossing, you’ll find
it easier to grab hold of this ep.
Stuart Adamson continues his
positive tidings and the heavy
Scottish texture that sets his
band apart. One problem: pre-
dictability. The vocals remain
hazy and Mark Brzezicki’s
drumming is still infectious and
riveting, but we’ve heard this all
before. The difference? Wonder-
land is more subdued than its
predecessor, which could be due
to the fact that it is essentially an
interim project. If I were you, I’d
hold out for an lp. They’re Worth

the album never lags.

But don’t be misled. This
album is as poppy as anything
around, with its Chicago-ish
horn arrangements on “Head-

“The Paris Match,” tastefully
sung by Tracey Thorn.

There is so much to love about
this album: its soulful depth, the
impeccable musicianship of
Weller and keyboardist Mick

Listening to this album is little

the work of kids who have just

found a new toy and are fever-

do with it. Occasional hints that

there might be something amiss
in the melee are squashed - by
overbearing musical repetitive-

that are not only annoying but
aggravating. The Last Night in

When the forces that dominate

the changing economic climate ~—
burgeoning technology and the
resulting problem of worker dis-
placement —— collided, a new age
of involvement for universities
across the state was born. That
academic big bang was christened
the Ben Franklin Partnership.

Representatives from the year-
old program delivered one of
many presentations last weekend
at a conference on economic rec-
overy held here. While many of
the conference workshops talked

‘about saving jobs, the high-tech
adventures of people like Dr. Cha-
, rles Brinton, a Pitt biochemist
wotr'k_ing to, develop human yac-
"‘ci'nes,'kept the attention of the
C  unemployed in attendance.

They learned how a small com-
pany in Washington, Pa._, received
advice and technology through

.the program that led to ‘a better
method for theproduction of arti-
ﬁcial hip joints. Both Brinton and
the Washington firm found help
at the Western Pennsylvania
Advanced Technology Center, a
joint operation between Pitt and
Carnegie-Mellon University and
one of four centers in the state that
form the Ben Franklin
Partnership.

Started last March with $10
million in funding from the state,

t which was matched by funds from
private industry, the partnership
is approaching its second fiscal
year with a hefty increase in fund-
ing waiting it. Governor Richard
Thorburgh’s proposed l98_4-85
budget included a l00 percent
increase in funding for the

~ program. _ .

Brinton’s work is just one of 48
projects currently funded by the
center, ranging from attempts to
better clean the coal mined in the
Western Pennsylvania area to
retraining programs intended to
place unemployed workers of the
smoke stack industries back to

. work.

Dr. Roger Ahlbrandt, assistant
to the provost at Pitt and one of
the center’s co-directors, main-
tains that the goal ofthe program
remains simple. “Our objective is
to create jobs, period,” he said.
The unemployed asked in return:
How many?

Dwight Sangrey of Carnegie-
Mellon project that their center

By Do Nguyen

Ben Franklin Partnership
opens door to the future

years. They also hope to save an
additional 2,200 jobs by transfer-
ring existing technologies to com-
panies in need of a competitive
edge. —

The center, Ahlbrandt
explained, will submit its proposal
for its share ofthe state funding by
July lj The center is currently
reviewing the 75 new applications
for funding, along with 43 renewal
requests. From that group. Ahl-
brandt and company must choose
those that deserve funding. Each
project proposal must be accom-
panied with an assurance of some
type of matching funding.

“With any kind of research pro-
gram, the‘ normal .project life is
more than a year," Ahlbrandt
said. “Most of our projects envi-
sion being funded to completion
—— for two to three years.

“If the state funding were not

significantly increased, we,

wouldn’t have much money to
fund new proposals,” he said. “I
think it would have been a stra-
tegic mistake for the state not to
really have upped the funding. We
would have had a program that
nobody would buy into because of
the fact that we couldn’t deliver
anything new.”

Research and development pro-
jects receive two—thirds ofthe cen-
ter’s budget, according to
Alhbrandt, with 30 percent of the
remainder going to entrepreneur-
ial assistance programs and the
rest to retraining and education.

The goal of all three compo-
nents and the impetus for heavy
state and private industry involve-
ment remains job creation. ‘

“It is really the job-creation
aspect that is our guiding princi-
ple,” Ahlbrandt said. “Obviously,
if you look at the small mill towns
in this region and throughout the
state, they rely on coal or steel or
heavy industry, which is hurting.
It doesn’t take much perception to
see that there is a need.”

They came from Erie to talk about
retraining andjob forecasting. They tra-
velled from Midland to discuss co—ops
and employee takeovers. The unem-
ployed and underemployed, union
bosses and community organizers, pri-

.ests and politicians met this past week at
. Pitt, hoping to find the path to eco-

nomic recovery..
A group called the -Mon Valley

Unemployed Committee -— one of a
growing number of such organizations
nationwide —- convened “Comeback,

Regional Recovery Community Style”
at David Lawrence Auditorium last Fri-
day and Saturday, attracting nearly
1,000 people.

Among the conference organizers
and supporters were adminstrators and
faculty from Pitt and other area univer-
sities. Barney Oursler, an unemployed
steel worker and conference organizer,
said that the worlds ofthe academicians
and the unemployed are not far
removed".

‘‘It’s the same problem,” Oursler said.
“Lots and lots of people at Pitt are
involved in the struggles of poor
people." ‘

Oursler said that community interest ‘

in the economic problems has become
widespread, and that no group can
exclude themselves.

“You can’t have a Pitt in the midst of
a ghetto,” he said.

Pitt professor of social work James
Cunningham said that after World War
II. the corporations that were commit-
ted to the economic climate in the Pitts-
burgh area began to shift their focus
elsewhere. He said that while Pitt
played only a secondary role in Renais-
sance I. it must become a major force in
the latest attempt at economic recovery.

“Other institutions have to take over
and one of those is Pitt.” he said.

Cunningham chaired a workshop
Saturday entitled “Studies ofCommun-
ities in Stress." which included a presen-
tation on the effects of plant closings on
females.

Kay Snyder and Tom Nowak, profes-
sors at Indiana U niversity of Pennsylva-

limits their ‘role. Likewise, CMU “is
viewed as an agent of the corporations.
“On the other hand, a lot of people at
Pitt are having an impact. The resources
available here are vital.” .
One officeactive in the area of assist-

‘ ance to the unemployed is the Office of _

Urban and Community Services. “We
are one of the few groups within the
university to actually get our hands

‘dirty,” said field ~coordinator Steve

Zupcic.

Pam Scott, another coordinator,
helped conduct the conference's work-
shop on health care. Zupcic said that the
group has been conducting an effort to

bring free and reduced—cost health care’,

to the unemployed and needy in the

area. (

He said that the center has also been
working with area food banks to insure
better service and to cut down on
abuses.

Oursler said that workshops on
health care and utilities received the
most attention at the conference.

He called the conference a success
and said that the initial impact would be
the creation of other such committees in
the region.

“There is a growing awareness in the
community,” Oursler said. He added
that individuals are now more aware of
sources for help.

Statistics released last week"revealed
an unemployment rate of ll.5 percent
in Pittsburgh, 9.2 percent in the state
and 7.8 percent nationwide. Oursler
looked beyond the numbers.

“We have some statistics of our own,"
Oursler said. “If you work 5-l0 hours a
week, they don’t count you. That may
not be a lot, but when you are hungry
it’s something. i

“They are trying to write unemploy-
ment off by looking atthe statistics.”

Oursler said that the work ofthe Mon
Valley Unemployed Committee and
others must go beyond conferences and
discussion. “its time to move forward
on the issues,“ he said.

Pitt programs attempt to
translate confusing data

According to the Bureau of
Laboristatistics, more Americans
are working now than ever before,
with the nation’s employment
level at 104.4 million. Yet, in Pitts-
burgh, where more than one out
of every 10, workers is still unem-
ployed, this news brings little
comfort. -

Many of the area’s unemployed
workers, along with faculty, stu-
dents and administrators from the
University of Pittsburgh, gathered

this past Friday and Saturday on 

Pitt’s campus to take part in work-
shops and lectures focusing on
economic recovery in Southwest-
ern Pennsylvania. ‘

While no one left the conference
with a job, participants did receive
information on everything from
how pension-funds affect an area’s
economy to how neighborhood
groups can work to bring in jobs.

According to Dr. Samuel
Myers of the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs,
the university can play a useful
role in providing information to
the community. The best way that
this can be accomplished, accord-
ing to Myers, is through public
forums and- workshops where
there is an attempt to translate
research findings into more gen-

_ eral terms.

“Unfortunately, I don’t think
that this is one of the university’s
strengths,” Myers said.i“lt is good
at presenting research to the aca-
demic community. There is »a tre-
mendous problem with trying to
translate academic findings into
usable information.

“Suppose we do‘ an in—depth
study of the domestic and foreign
content of commodities pur-
chased by the city of Pittsburgh,

_ and we try to identify the impact

of purchases on local employ-
ment. A good analysis, of some-
thing like that can get to be very
complex,” Myers said. “The bot-
tom line has to be communicated
in a manner that is fully consistent

 

  

By Ray Wuslich

with the complexity of the analy-

sis, but it has to be done so that the‘

bottom line is not obscured. Such
findings can be communicated
effectively, however, and academ-
ics have a responsibility to do
that.” -

Still, Pitt isn’t without pro-
grams designed to promote eco-
nomic growth in the community.

The Small Business Develop-
ment Center, run through the
Graduate School of Business, pro-

gvides counseling, training and

technical assistance to the small
business community at a nominal
charge. Seminars cover such top-
ics as marketing, accounting,
and advertising and promotion.
The program has been very suc-
cessful. According to director
Clarence Curry, 350 to 400 indi-
viduals took part in the couseling
program this past year, and 500 to.
600 were involved in training

' services.

The university.also operates a
computer database through the
Office of Urban and Community
Services. According to Michael
McLendon, who runs the compu-
ter service, the office can help

small businesses with such prob-‘

lems as putting together mailing
lists and can help in identifying
population characteristics which
may be useful in marketing.
“We have a faculty skills bank,”
McLendon said, “which lists
faculty and administrators who
have volunteered their time and
expertise to help small busi-
nesses.” Faculty members supply

the office with a list of their skills .

and areas in which they can be of
assistance, like consulting and
planning, and the office can then

match skills withthe needs of the .

small businessman, McLendon
said.‘

Whether or not the small busi-
nessman is the answer to the
region’s economic problems is an
open question. As Myers says,
“lt’s probably true that small busi-

ness generates more employ-1,

ment, but they also have higher.“
’ failure rates.” » _‘ ,
This is generally due to poor “

choices‘ of markets or poor man-.
agement, Myers said. “This is
where the public has an interest in
helping small businesses to direct
investment to areas where there is
a demand,” he said.

By Joe Zeﬂ
Senior Editor

Charles Smith, a 6-9, 210-pound
forward from Warren G. Harding
High School in Bridgeport, Conn.,

signed a letter-of-intent last month,

to play basketball at the University
of Pittsburgh.

Smith chose Pitt over Marquette,
Villanova and Rutgers. He was
touted among the top players in the
country and played in the Dapper
Dan and McDonald’s national all-
star games this spring.

He will return to Pittsburgh on
May 14 as a member of the Ozanam
all-star team, which will battle the
Russian Junior Olympic squad at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Pitt News cornered Smith at
his Bridgeport home and learned of
his experiences as a high school All-
America and his expectations as a
Pitt player. '

any college in the country; yet, you
decided on the University of Pitts-

A: Well, I took a visit down Pitt
and I really enjoyed it. I liked the
business program that they had to
offer there. I liked Coach Chipman
and the whole coaching staff, plus
all the players seemed pretty friendly
and nice, so that was one of the main
reasons I chose Pitt.

Q: Which players in particular?

A: There’s really no one in partic-
ular. I knew Curtis Aiken for a
while, but I wouldn’t like to say
therek anyone in particular because
they’re all about the same.

Q: You gained a reputation as a
pretty good student at Harding.
What will you pursue at Pitt, and
how will you balance your athletic
and academic responsibilities?

A: Well, I ’d like to major in busi-
ness management and administra-
tion. I don 7 actually know how I
would balance them, but I was just
going to try to do the best I can. I
just have to wait and see. ’

A: Yeah. I don '1 think it's hard at

Q: Isn’t there a lot of pressure?

A: Not really. Toward the begin-

The pressures just eased off.

Q: After watching you perform in

ready for that?

A: I don ‘I think I ’ll ever be ready

that I can do the things that I’m

do you expect as a freshman?

A: Well, I ‘m not going to say that

people are asking me am I going to

When I do come there, I am going

goes, I don't even know and, I just
have to wait and see how that comes

-Pih‘ Invite lost home hurrdhfor frock Trio-

By Charlie O'Hara
Senior Editor

When seniors Todd Colas, Gar-
land Brown and Bill Moorhead step
to the starting line in Saturday’s
John Woodruff Pitt Outdoor Track
Invitational, it will be more than
another shot at qualifying for the
NCAA national championships.

.For this All-America trio, it will
be the ﬁnal time that they compete at
Pitt Stadium as Panthers.

Their first’two years here were
spent with head coach Mike Agosti-
nella, who was petitioned out of the
job by the team's members in the
spring of 1982. Then came new head
coach John Vasvary from the Uni-
versity of Virginia, and things began
looking upl

Some two years, 30 school
records, seven All-America perfor-
mances and two individual national
titles later, Pitt track has gained
national respect..

Although world-ranked hurdler
Roger Kingdom has grabbed much
of the media attention, Colas,
Brown and Moorhead have cer-
tainly done their share in placing
Pitt's team among the top II in the

_ country.

With three weekends remaining to
qualify for the national champion-
ships, all three are looking to regain
All-America status.

Colas, who became an All-
America by placing ﬁfth in the 1000-
yard run at the indoor
championships in March, ran a per-
sonal best time of 3:45 in the 1500
meter run at the Big East Champion-
ships last weekend. Both he and
Moorhead will run in the Invitation
1500 on Saturday. To qualify for the
national championships, a competi-
tor must run better than 3:42. Des-
pite the fact that the qualifying
standard is a big step up, Colas and
Moorhead are optimistic. ’

“I can’t really complain about the
season so far,” Colas said. “I know
that I have to stay up a little bit
better through the first three quar-
ters of the race. I think I can qualify,
and this weekend means a lot to me
-- running my last race at home. Pitt
has been such a big part of my life.”

His qualifying chances will cer-
tainly be improved’ because Moor-
head will set a fast pace for the first
half-mile (800-meters) in hopes that
one of the two will surpass the stand-
ard.

“I’m gonna force the pace for

Todd through the first half-mile,”
Moorhead said.

. “lfl still have it, I’m not going to
let anybody pass me.

“I believe it’s possible for me to‘

qualify. I haven’t had that day yet

this year when everything has been
just right. I’m in good shape right
now, but I haven‘t run a race yet this
year when I felt real good and the
weather conditions were good.
Hopefully this weekend....

“Ifl don’t make it on Saturday, I
might~be goingto Virginia on Sun-
day for a race. Ray Flynn from Ire-
land, he’s a 3:50 miler. He will be
there.” The national championship’s
qualifying time of 3:42 in the 1500-
meters converts to 4:00 in the mile.

Moorhead came to Pitt after a
frustrating year at Wake Forest.

“My four years here have been
really great.”

Brown will compete in the 800-
meter run. He qualified for the
indoor championships in the event

Aside from Colas, Moorhead and
Brown, Vasvary believes two more
of his athletes stand “better than
good” chances of qualifying for the
NCAA meet in June.

Darryl "Shepherd, who usually

plays basketball for Pitt, is a strong 3

contender to qualify in the I 10-
meter high hurdles. He placed third
(l4.43) the weekend at the Big East
championships to two national qua-
Iifers — Martin Booker ofVillanova
and Barry McClain of Seton Hall.

“As far as speed and technique are
involved, I think I’m in good shape,”
Sheperd said. “Its a matter of endu-
rance for me. I beat these guys who
are running I3.6 and 13.5 over the
first five hurdles. lt‘s those six, seven
and eight hurdles that they beat me
on. .
Shepherd will need to run,a 13.75
time in order to qualify for the
NCAA meet.

Freshman Tim Manes is another
Panther hopeful. Manes ran a l:49.6
and qualified for the finals of the
800-meter run at the Big East cham-
pionships last weekend and will need
to cut his time by more than a second

Assistant Coach joins greats in hCII|

Special to
The Pm News

Steve Lewis, Pitt’s second-
year assistant men’s track coach,
has been inducted into the New-
port News (Va.) Track Hall of
Fame.

It was a great honor for the
Brooklyn-born Lewis, especially
considering the outstanding
athletic tradition of the city.
Newport News has produced
some of the nation's finest foot-
ball and track athletes.

New York Giants linebacker
Lawrence Taylor is from the
area, for example, as is Dallas
Cowboys running back Ron
Springs. Former New ,York
Giants quarterback Norm Snead
and current Pittsburgh Maulers
cornerback Jerry Holmes also
hail from that area.

As for track, the area currently
boasts the nation’s top high
school hurdler in Calvin Holmes

and the top 600—meter runner,

Ronald Coleman.

When considering his accomp-
lishments, it is easy to see why
Lewis was inducted into the same
hall of fame that includes a cou-
ple oflocal legends - Julie Conn
and Thad Madden. Conn once
went 18 straight years without
losing a dual track meet, while
Madden posted a 180-6 record in
football and enjoyed similar suc-
cess in track.

While serving as head track
coach at Virginia’s Menchville
High School, Lewis coached
teams to a combined 12 state
indoor and outdoor champion-
ships and 132 of I50 dual meets.
He also produced 35 high school
All-Americas and two national
high" school record holders who
still retain their titles. In 1981,
Lewis was one of eight finalists
for National High School Coach
of the Year.

The honor is one that Lewis
will always cherish.

“Between myself and Newport
News, it’s about the highest

honor they can bestow. It repres-
ents many good times, memo-
ries, friends and good athletes. It
is a symbol of a very great and
important time in my life.

“I know the career that I had
and it was almost magical. But I
don't feel I belong on the same
platform as them [Conn and

‘Madden]. They are probably

responsible for more pro football
players and track people than
anyone in the world.”

Newport News City Athletic
Director Wayne Begor said that
the selection of Lewis by the
committee, composed of track
coaches and others in the track
community, was an excellent
one.

“Steve had a great career
here,” Begor said, “plus he was
very dedicated to track, as a
whole, in the area. He was a
workaholic as far as track was
concerned.

“I think it is saying something
about the job he did that he was
elected so soon. We have such a

rich tradition that there is a big
battle every year to decide who to
select and who to pass over.”

Lewis believes
many reasons for his success.

"I think much of the credit
should go to the city itself,”
Lewis said. “Between the kids,
tradition, coaches and the fans,
you have a lot of great people to
work with."

Small talk with Smith

continued from page ten

But he wasn’t coming mainly
to see me, he was coming to see
other players on the team. And
what happened was, I guess, I
know him personally and I speak
to him when I see him, you
know, shake his hand here and
there, just ‘hi’ and leave.

I guess the rumor started that
they were back recruiting me
again. That’s mainly how that
started.

Q: How surprised were you

when the rumor was broadcast.

on ESPN?

A: Oh, I was surprised, mainly
because it came over ESPN. But
the rumor, I wasn’t surprised at
that. Rumors come and go, and
that's what they are —— rumors.

Qlzl Pittsburgh sportswriters .

have likened you to a 6-foot-9
guard because of your dribbling

and shooting talents. How
would you characterize your
talents?

A: I feel that down the road I

will be able to play guard. I ‘m
working on my lateral move-
ment now. There’s a lot of skills
where I could check another
man 6-feet.

I don ’t know. It may come out

to whereas I could play guard. I

don ’t know whether I'll play it
there, but maybe down the road,
I will be able to play it. 

Q: What are your weaknesses
as a basketball player?

A: All I'm doing now is I'm on
a Nautilus program. I'm just
working on my upper-body
strength.

Q: What stands out as your
fondest memory in sports?

A: [pause] I don ’t really know.

Q: Would it be when your
team won the championship, or

A: I can ’I really say, because a
-lot of things have happened. I
can ’t really say which was the
best one because they were all
special moments to me. I can ’t
really say which one it was.

Q: Isn’t there anything that
stands out?

A: Just playing in the McDo-
nald’s and the Dapper Dan
stood out and, you know, being
picked for different things and
winning a lot of awards. They all
stand out but I can ’t really say

Well, yes, when I played in the
Wheelchair Classic [an all—star
game in which the best players of
four New York boroughs play to
benefit handicapped children].
In order to play in that you had
to write an essay. And I did get
the Best Essay Award.

Spring football leftovers

Leftovers from an expired spring

' football camp:

0 Offensive tackle Bill Fralic,
linebacker Troy Benson and def-
ensive end Chris Doleman were
selected as team tri-captains for
the approaching season by their
teammates.

Fralic, a 6-5, 290-pound All-
America, is considered by many
the elite lineman in all of college
football. Last season, he placed
eighth in Heisman Trophy bal-
loting and was a finalist in Out-
land and Lombardi Award
balloting. He enters his senior
year as a contender for all three
honors.

“Bill has proven what an out-
standing football player he is,”
said Pitt head coach Serafino
“Foge" Fazio. “Along with his

‘outstanding natural abilities, the

key to his success has been his
work habits. We want our young
players to see that no matter how

good you are, you still have to
work to get better. That's what
Bill Fralic has done.”

Benson, a 6-1, 225 pounder,
was the leading tackler on the
Pitt defense a year ago. He had
162 tackles (64 solos, 98 assists)
and also led the team with four
interceptions and 13 tackles-for-
losses.

“Troy has proven to be a good
leader,” said Fazio. “He works
hard and plays hard, and the
results of that kind of work effort
are evident on the football field.”

Doleman, a 6-6, 230 pounider,
had 100 tackles as a junior and
was second on the team with six
sacks.

“Chris has the potential to
have a Rickey Jackson-type of
year. He is much more mature
now, and at the end of last year,
he was playing much more con-
sistently," Fazio said.)

0 Flanker Dwayne Milloy and
linebacker Steve Apke, both

' do with his success. as a player."

sophomores, were winners ofthe
10th annual Ed Conway Memor-
ial Award as the most improved
offensive and defensive players
in spring camp.

The award is. named in
memory of former WTAE-TV
sportscaster Ed Conway, a
former “Voice of the Panthers”
who passed away 10 ‘years ago.

“Dwayne is a fine athlete,"
said Fazio. “He came here as a
defensive back, and he even
played some quarterback in
practice this fall. He switched
over to flanker this spring, and
he .has proved to be a sure-
handed receiver. He is an excit-
ing player with very good speed.

“Steve is an outstanding
young man. He played a great
game in the Fiesta Bowl [14 tack-
les], and this spring, he picked up ‘
right where he left off. He plays
the run extremely well, and he is
just a solid footballplayer. His
intensity on the ﬁeld had a lot to
