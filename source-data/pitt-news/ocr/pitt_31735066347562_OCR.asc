Damage claims against the
University as a result of the recent
Langley Hall explosion are being
accepted by Pitt’s Office» of the
Treasurer, according to Pitt’s
Assistant Treasurer Ted Corbett

Corbett said his office will do
everything within its means to see
that students and any other person
who suffered either personal injury
or loss of property be compensated

.“Each claim will be turned over
to our insurance companies, which
are all prepared to settle any claim
within two weeks,” he said.

‘ Corbett said he has notified all
hospitals which were involved in
taking care of injuries related to the
explosion to send the bills to the
Treasurer’s Office.

Matthew Jackson, a Pitt Legal
Services Attorney ‘handling the
University’s legal arrangements
stemming from the explosion, said
the Treasurer’s Office will hire an
individual to process claims “as a
means of eliminating any unnecess-
ary ﬁnancial burden on students.
“'But."_' he added. “this action is
not an admission of guilt."

He said Pitt has neither accepted
nor been assigned liability for the
Langley Hall explosion.

According to Jackson, liability
can only be assigned by a court
ruling, and. in this case, can not be

Payne, after the announcement of .

Payne, a member of the SG Legal

done so until the cause of the blast is
determined, and until Pitt’_s insur-
ance contracts have been properly
interpreted by both University and
insurance company officials.

Corbett said if the cause of the
explosion is determined to be the
responsibility of a party other than
the University, Pitt’s insurance
companies will act against the
responsible party. ‘

“I would like to emphasize that
Pitt’s insurance companies will
settle the claims of any person
involved in the Langley accident as
soon as possible, and they will
pursue the matter of liability once
the cause of the blast’ is
determined," he said.

According to Corbett, neither
family of the two women killed by
the explosion has ﬁled a claim with
his ofﬁce. He said claims« for
medical expenses from those
injured by the blast have been
accepted by his ofﬁce, but he

"expects many more have yet to be
ﬁled.

“The claims have been relatively
small thus far,” he said, “but I
expect they will eventually total a
substantial amount.”

Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC) Chairman Michael Silverman
said several students have been to
the LAC office in the last week
seeking help with damage claims
against the University as a result of

_the explosion. “All students

result of injury or property loss are
being directed to contact Ted
Corbett, ” Silverman said.

Corbett said medical expenses,
and lost or damaged personal
property which is new, will be
compensated in full by either
replacement of the property or a
check for its full value. He said,
however, that students will be

asked to state the age of all,

damaged property and, as is
standard insurance company proc-
edure, the older the property is, the
less a person will receive.

Corbett also said each person
ﬁling a damage claim will be asked

_ to sign a notorized statement. Pitt’s

insurance companies, he said, will
conduct investigations into every
claim ﬁled with his office.

Merle Ryan, director of Pennsyl-
vania’s General State Authority,
(GSA) said his office, which owns
the bond on Langley Hall, is only
responsible for the removal and
restoration of the building’s dam-
aged areas.

“As far as the Commonwealth is
concerned,” Ryan said, “we are
only responsible for restoring
Langley Hall to a safe and
operational condition. Liability is
the responsibility of the internal
part of the University,” he said.

Ryan said sometime in the future,
after the insurance companies
meet, the GSA will rebuild the
lecture‘ rooms (lE‘s1l.‘0)Cd by the
explosion.

the state. ,

Last night Gov. Shapp asked all
restaurants, theatres. -sports
arenas and other non-essential
commercial ﬁrms in. Pennsylvania
to close until noon Monday to save
natural gas. This order followed a
Wednesday night directive issued
by Lt. Gov. Ernest Kline that
closed public and private’ schools
across Pennsylvania.

Colleges and universities were
exempted from the order_ because
in many cases students live in
dormitories that must be heated.

Pitt spokesperson Mary Ann Aug
said. “In the absence of any
explicit direction from the Gov-
ernor's Office we will follow the
earlier order and lower all

‘ thermostats. "

Although they will remain open.
Pitt and other state colleges and

there will be enough natural gas for

Al Langley Blast Site

BY MREA CSORBA

Stress marks visible on Langley 3.

Hall walls, doorways and stairwells
have been checked by state, city and
University structural engineers,
Hunt Martin, Pitt’s physical plant
director conﬁrmed yesterday.
“Langley Hall has been inspect-
ed by structural experts from the
Department of General Services,
and by city and University
engineers,” Martin said in res-
ponse to student worry that the
cracks and plaster breaks left by last
Thursday's fatal explosion indicate
the building is structurally unsafe.
“The wall in the short stairway
which leads to Langley’s basement
garage shows more than modest
damage,” Martin said. “The

- corner of the doorway entrance in

the garage suffered much damage

and the lintel over the doorway is
cracked. It will be removed.”

The stairway has been posted as
“off limits.”

“Other walls which may show
cracks but present no clear danger,
will remain,” Hunt said. He said
that none of the walls in Langley
Hall are structural walls.

Three contractors were awarded
clean-up contracts Wednesday by
Ronald G. Lynch secretary of State
General Services, the ﬁrm which
took over ownership of Langley
Hall. The building's former owner
was PennsyIvania’s General State
Authority, which built it in 1963.

BY CRIS HALL

Dr. M. Oskoui, a tenured Pitt
associate professor of pharmaco-

logy whose charges of discrimina- ‘

tion were deemed substantial by
the Equal Employment Opportun-
ity (EEOC) and whose case sparked
Congressional scrutiny of Pitt’s
hiring and ﬁring practices, has
denied charges leveled against him
by Pitt administrators.

Oskoui also offered speciﬁc
charges of “hartassment, inter-
ference and discrimination” level-
ed against him by Pitt that he said
were motivated by his outspoken
support of -affirmative action
programs at the University. Many
of Oskoui’s allegations are sup-
ported by federal and court
documents and depositions obtain-
ed by the Pitt News.

Oskoui, who faced dismissal
more than a year ago on charges of
incompetence, said statements by
University officials concerning his
research and teaching were “lies.

“They say I haven’t made public
the results of my research, ’ ' Oskoui
said. “That is not true——I have
presented several ﬁndings.”

Abstract volumes from pharma-
cological conventions in Helsinki
and Atlantic City show Oskoui has
presented several reports concern-
ed with his National Institute
Health (NIH)-funded research into
the effect of marijuana on cats.

“It is not for the University to
decide if my research is -good or
bad." Oskoui said.

Oskoui said the University has

attempting to have his federal

grant revoked. canceling classes he

was scheduled to teach. transfer-
ring him from his area of expertise,
requiring him to prove “the
genuineness of my signature,” and
what he called “petty harrass-
merit.”

The “chronology of events” in
Oskoui’s case, according to. an
EEOC document dated March 31,
1975, are as follows:

“Charging Party Oskoui made
verbal statements and wrote letters
volunteering information with re-
gard to sex discrimination. This
was published in the University
newspaper. ‘

“Charging Party, subsequent to
above events, failed to receive any
more payraises while other faculty
members did receive them.
Furthermore, Charging Party was
subjected to hearings with regard
to his employment status shortly
after he made verbal statements at
public meetings complaining of
possible discrimination by Respon-
dent (Pitt)." ’

“I spoke out about discrimina-
tion because there was differential
treatment," Oskoui said. “They
put their friends in there-—qualiﬁ-
cations mean nothing——-without a
search committee. And if you say
publicly that ‘this is wrong, then
you are in trouble.

Oskoui added, “Edison Mont-
gomery (associate vice chancellor
for the -health professions) was
quoted as saying I did not want to
be evaluated, but I was evaluated.

' They gave me permanent tenure.

They evaluated me and made me a
member of the graduate faculty.
NIH evaluated me and gave me my

grant. Now the University is trying .

to terminate my grant.

“I want to know how many
professors’ grants they try to
terminate," he said. “They
haven't been able to terminate
mine, so they try to harrass me.
Montgomery interfered when I
tried to buy a calculator. This man
has a bachelor's degree in ﬁne arts
and he tells me I do not need a
calculator for my calculations.
What does he know about medical
research?"

United States District court
records show Oskoui ﬁled suit
against the University, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar, several University
administrators in the health area.
and individual members of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees in a “complaint
for injunctive relief and damages
for violation of civil rights.”

“I take academic freedom and
tenure very seriously,“ Oskoui
said. “Justice has to prevail. I am
not rich, but I have told them I will
go to the Supreme Court, if I have
to.”

The EEOC’s March, 1975,
determination of the case states:
“Respondent (Pitt) denies Charg-
ing Party’s allegations without

‘qualifications and contends that at

no time has the University of
Pittsburgh or any of its representa-
tives discriminated against Dr.
Oskoui on the basis of his national
origin, or any other basis.”

RSA Reviews New Dorm Plan Residence Hall Damage

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Resident Student Association
(RSA) members, dissatisfied with
proposed renovations of student
dormitories, are drawing up a
contingency plan for the affected
areas in Holland, McCormick and
the Medical Center Nurses Resi-
dence (MCNR).

A committee of RSA and Office of
Residence Life (ORL) members will
review the housing plans and
suggest alternative ways to utilize
space and present grievances to the
Housing Office, according to RSA
spokesman Michelle Sikora.

“RSA reaction was not favorable.
We had no input and were not
informed of the plans before last
week. The committee will give us a
chance to air our grievances and to
get suggestions from students who

know what space isbeing abused," A

Sikora said.

The renovations, which will make
space for 124_ more students,
include converting lounges in
MCNR and select single rooms in
Holland Hall to triple and double
rooms, respectively, and turning
selected McCormick suites from six
to ten-person apartments.

“The renovation plans are pretty
firm, but we are re-evaluating areas
to see what we can do to alleviate
problems of not having lounges.
Can we move the kitchens rather
than lose a lounge?” ORL Director
Fred Fonseca said. ,

Renovations are necessary, ac-
cording to Housing Director Don
Hughes, to ease the University’s
housing crunch. While the number
of students demanding on-campus
residency is expected to increase in
the next few years, it would not be
sufficient to warrant building a new
dormitory, Hughes said recently.

The University currently handles

the overflow of students bye

contracting for space in the Hotel
Webster Hall. But the hotel is

beginning a renovation program

and a definite temporary housing
agreement for next year has not
been made, Hughes said.

It was assumed, according to
Hughes, that the University’s
agreement with Webster Hall
would be affected by the hotel's
renovation and that “we will have to
look elsewhere for housing.” But
Webster Hall manager Herb Pianin
said yesterday there is a definite
possibility that the hotel will accept
students. “I’m not throwing anyone
out.” Pianin said.

Damages in Pitt's residence halls
during the fall term were down from
last year's figures, according to
Gerald Dalton, assistant housing
director.

“My estimate from our budget
figures is that they are down,”
Dalton said. “But again, our

budget ﬁgures are on a yearly basis
and we don't know what may come
up. We certainly have not hit 50
percent of our budget in the first six
months.”

Common sense, supported by tradition, calls for the newly elected
Student Government Board to take part in the selection of the
‘Allocations Committee. These two governmental bodies must work
together and work under priorities set by the new board. It is only
natural that a peaceful co-existence can be advanced by a board’s .
selecting people whose background and abilities complement these

priorities.

The newly elected Student Government Board will 11ot get the chance
to provide input into the selection of a complementary Allocations
Committee. For outgoing president Barry Weisband and his Board took

It is questionable how helpful this move is. It appears Weisband has

We urge the “new Board‘ to dissolve this illegitimately appointed

constitution does not give SGB the power to dissolve committees, but
then it does not deny them that power, either. Just like the loophole that

President Carter has dutifully
kept one of his major campaign

‘promises by giving a blanket pardon

to draft evaders. Using presidential
constitutional power swiftly, he has
no doubt delighted one camp of
people while infuriating many
others.

The amnesty question has been a
traditionally hot issue in the past
decade with one ironic twist. Both
sides have good arguments—leav-
ing amnesty debaters in a most
precarious situation.

Many of those who protested the
war by evading the draft did so
because their hearts and minds told
them war was wrong, especially the
Indochina campaign.

No one will say that war is right,
desirable, or even the “American
Way.” Furthermore, few people
believe the security of our shores

However, the debate does not
simply end here. The dishonor draft

unforgivable. Does a person simply

hindsight——being able to look back
and reﬂect on the Vietnam years.

This time, those siding with the
draft , dodgers point to the
disasterous ending, the “no peace
less honor,” saying, “See, we were
right. -What was accomplished by
fighting in ,Vir .nam?” _

The opposition noted the thous-
ands who died, were injured, or are
still missing to drive home one
point——-dodging was wrong.

So where does it leave us now?
The war is long gone and a fresh
administration», not connected to the
Vietnam era in any way, has taken
over.

Now is, no doubt, the time to heal
all wounds and conipromise on the
longstanding issue. Carter has done
that with his pardon, which hinges
upon forgiving those people for
something he believes was wrong.

Another question is what to do

Student ’Mis|eaders’, Restrict Democratic

BY BILL KALMAN,

We all know that the government

 is cutting back on social services,
education and health care.
_/there’s another component to this
I . p attack on the standard of living of

But

working people, one that isn’t as
obvious. ‘And that’s the cutting

' back of democratic rights.

The ruling rich of this country can
see‘ that the American people.
especially the most oppressed,
aren’t just sitting back and

accepting inﬂation, unemployment,’
and austerity measures. Rather, A

student coalitions, Black liberation
and anti-racist groups, feminist
organizations, and trade unions are
responding to theeconomic crisis
with increasing militancy. Demon-
strations, picket-lines, boycotts and

rallies have been organized in’

almost every major American city to
protest hospital closings, tuition
hikes and high prices. Indeed, large
sections of the population are
beginning to seriously question an
economic system based on private
proﬁt for a few instead of human
needs for all. And because of this
combativity, the government is
hacking away at democratic rights
in an effort to quash any dissension.

That the government is attempt-
ing to‘. undermine the Bill of Rights
should come as no surprise in this

pest-Watergate era. A $40 million we
 ﬁyﬁfgﬁtagainst the govern: g .

a

ment by the Young Socialist
Alliance and the Socialist Worker's
Party ’ has been instrumental in
exposing the campaign against
democratic rights. Thousands of
secret ﬁles have been uncovered
showing that the FBI, the CIA and a
host of other government agencies
spyed on, bugged, intimidated and
harassed Americans who simply
disagreed with government policy.
The sordid operations of the
government’s political police is
perhaps most readily seen on the
nation’s campuses.

Government spying on the
student movement began in full
force with the campus civil rights
activists of the early sixties. Then,
when political activism reached a
height in the late sixties and early
seventies, government spies tar-
geted anti-war coalitions, black
student unions and feminist organi-

zations for disruption. The FBI kept
ﬁles on thousands of students and
faculty, and at times even used
physical intimidation to head off
political activism on the campuses.
And throughout this entire period,
college and high school adminis-
trators have usually sided with the
G-men, and not the victimized
students.

University administrations suf-
fered a setback several years ago in
their ability to control what
organizations students could belong
to, and what ideas students could
hear. During the recent slowdown
in student activism, however, these
administrations have been encour-
aged by the government’s covert
activities to try to “regulate” away
student rights. C One of the best
examples of the strategy to silence
political ideas by a labyrinth of
regulations is the case of the

 

Michigan Three.

The three—Brigid Douglas, Jim
Garrison and Tom Smith——were
arrested at Central Michigan
University in Detroit in October,
1976. They were charged with three
counts of criminal trespass, as well
as illegal occupation of a university
building by force. Their crime?
They were distributing socialist
literature at a public lecture at the
campus. Ironically, the lecturer at a
public lecture at the campus.
Ironically, the lecturer was Daniel
Schorr, who has been a target of the
government.

The attack on student rights is not
just occurring “somewhere else”—
it's happening here at Pitt. The
Board of Trustees and the
administration would go the same
route given half the chance.

Last year, the Pitt administration

‘ announced that it was going to

   

ax ..

with persons who committed other
crimes besides draft evading and
those who deserted the military.
These people are not classified as
‘conscientious objectors.

For this reason, a more idealistic
objective would have been to review
each case individually, instead of a
blanket pardon for some ' and

, nothing for others. Unfortunately

the time involved in such a long
process, guaranteed to sink in a
bureaucratic jungle, would only
lead to more bickering and less
healing. _ A

Nevertheless, deserters and oth-
er offenders should be allowed a
court hearing upon request-realiz-
ing the risk of possibly losing the
case.

President Carter, who once

, opposed any amnesty, made a large

concession in an effort to avert a
stand-off situation. In return, those
who fled should compromise
accordingly. and accept Carter’s
offer, demanding nothing more.

Though it is difficult to achieve, a
compromise must be met so the
issue can ﬁnally be solved and
buried. Then the era of the “new
spirit” will not be scarred by an old
problem.

R’ hts
enforce a policy restricting the right
to leaﬂet and distribute material.
This policy was clearly directed at
campus activists, although its
implementation would've hurt
every student on campus. Because
of student outrage and intervention
by the ACLU, the administration
was forced to back down.
lntertwined with the administra-
tion’s callous attitude towards free
speech is its contempt for academic
freedom. The university has been
making national headlines for the
political ﬁring of Dr. Paul Nyden.
Nyden is known for his working-
class perspective in the classroom.
The Board of Trustees, not known
for its working-class composition,
doesn’t appreciate this perspective.
It is interesting to note that, while
Pitt is doing everything possible to

deny Nyden tenure, it went out of its

way to bring the FBI*onto campus.
The administration gave the secret
agents free publicity and a booth to
use in recruiting Pitt students. The
FBI is not one of the most active
supporters of democratic rights.

‘In this context of an attack on
student rights nationally and
locally, one would think that student
leaders would be ﬁghting to expand
these rights. Unfortunately, some
student ‘leaders’ are ﬁghting to
restrict them at Pitt.

Both the Student Government
Elections Committee and the
Judicial Board voted to exclude two
candidates from the ballot in
yesterday’s ‘ student government
election. Mike Bates and Sally
Shoup have QPA’s above the
required 2.0, and gathered enough
signatures to be on the ballot. But,
they’re being penalized for handing
in their transcripts 40 minutes late.

This bureaucratic ruling of these
student misleaders against Bates
and Shoup cuts away at the
democratic rights of all Pitt
students. Student leaders at Pitt
should reject the SGEC’s undemo-
cratic decision, and join with the
student body to ﬁght all attacks on
student rights.

Young Socialist Alliance.

While reaching for a‘

My nose recovered in a few
minutes, but I cried out of sheer
disgust of that girl. She will be in
the way of people who can hopefully
help the victims of the accident, and
not only can she not help, she may
hurt more people like myself on her
curiosity mission. .

A large portion of students
swarmed to the scene of the thrilling
emergency. Many of the busy bees
were probably in the way, but at
least their curiosity was satisﬁed
and they were there——onthe scene!
If they were fortunate they
witnessed a wounded body or even
had the chance to speak with an
explosion victim. Maybe Pitt could
capitalize on these students and sell

tickets to watch a hungry lion
attacking someone in the Pitt
Stadium?

Where Did
Pianos Go?

The piano situation on campus is
one of the many that I just don’t
understand at all. For one thing,
the only available ones that I know
of right now are the two in the
Student Union-—now-that the
beautiful (?) grand piano in Tower A
has died (cause, still unknown...
murder? or suicide, after a hard
life?).

Of those in the Student Union,
one is conveniently located in the
quiet lounge, which means that
every time I go there to play itI find
snoozers and studiers whom I can’t
disturb.

Recently, I asked the woman at
the S.U. desk “how” and “if”
anyone played it. Her reply was
that no one really does. Then she
pointed me in the direction of their
other treasure, located downstairs
in the Pine Room. Other than one
flattened-out black key and a few
extraneous twangs, I found that
particular instrument semi-func-
tional, though very frustrating to
play.

Up until now, Ihaven’t mention-
ed the pianos in the music building.
Need I explain why? Unfortunately,
most of them seem to be suffering
from effects of the same disease
that has crippled their neighbors.
Besides that, they are primarily for
leaves little practice time for us

musically-inclined non-music
majors.

Fiat-A fair

Weather Friend

Thank you, Bob Pellegrini, for the
amusing and accurate article you
wrote about foreign cars in the Pitt
News.

I am the proud owner of a new
1976 Fiat 128 which handles
beautifully, is cute, gets terriﬁc gas
mileage and is a pleasure to
drive——when it starts. Not only will
the car not turn over when the
temperature drops below 15
degrees F, but, I can’t even get into
it because the locks freeze. After
trying everything from spray lock
defrosters to cups of boiling water, I
have resorted to the simplest
solution of all, never locking the car.

As for the problem of its not
starting on cold days, AAA came to
jump it three times, until I returned
it to the dealer who supposedly
ﬁxed it. The Fiat started for a week
after the dealer worked on it, as long
as I parked on a hill facing
downward away from the wind and
covered the engine with an old army
blanket. '

However, on Sunday, the day
before your article was printed, I
walked out to my parking lot,
unlatched the hood, removed the
blanket, jumped back into my car
and turned the key only to have it
die out after ten seconds and never
start again. I sympathize with you.

Winning System

Society’s.Ruin

I am very concerned about the
meaning all those ‘ ‘Pitt #1” buttons
have. I fear -it just may represent
people’s system of prioritie_s.

As antundergraduate, even when
we were spending some $300 billion
to wreak havoc on Vietnam, you saw
few, if any, “Stop the War”
buttons. Today, when old people

are forced to eat dog food to survive,
I haven't seen one “Gray Power”.
button. Or when someone is found
frozen to death in their apartment,
how come ‘ ‘Fight Duquesne Light”
buttonsare not in evidence?

Do the people who wear these Pitt
#1 buttons fail to understand what
the winning syndrome, on ‘ ‘number
one-ism” is doing to our society?
When there is no place in this
country for a drug overdose victim
to go to detoxicate, why is there any

. thought to paying a football coach

$125,000 a year for eight years? I
thought the University was sup-
posed to be the place for
enlightenment.

Our system of priorities‘ have
permitted Pitt football to be no
longer a sport, but rather big
business. And the players are not to
blame for they are victims as well.
There is something terribly wrong
in our society and all these ‘ ‘Pitt #1’ ’
buttons just may be a clear
representation of what it is!

Questions Unanswered

In Wake of Explosion

One can’t expect an entire
building to all of a sudden not be
there any more and ﬁnd that it
hasn't had a profound personal
effect. The recent explosion which
devastated an entire -. lecture hall
has brought many of us to a level of
awareness about personal safety
we do not usually share. That is,
there is some measure of care that
we can use to help prevent such
tragedies.

In this respect, various depart-
ments within the university are
conducting meetings about per-
sonal care and safety measures and
how we can avoid potential
tragedy. But isn't this only half of
the problem? Does not the
university also share responsibility
for our welfare‘! Can't weexpect
this? After all. whether knowingly
or not. we have faith in
university’s tacit assurances that
the facility's it provides for us are
properly constructed, maintained
and periodically inspected in
accordance with accepted proced-
ures outlined by law. If a hazard
existed which proper care of
facilities would eliminate, couldn't
we expect protection by the
university? Wouldn’t proper
precautions be taken if the
university kngav and was in-
terested?

The university has conducted a
closed investigation of the explo-
sion. Information the chancellor
has released about the explosion
does in no way show that he or his
committee has dealt with the
question of whether or not the
university has even acknowledged,
let alone actedupon, their vested
responsibilites for the safety and
welfare of students, staff and
faculty. University officials have,
to the contrary, publicly avoided
investigation of signiﬁcant events
and information associated with the
disaster which may uncover clues

» as tohow it came to be that two

people are dead and several more
seriously injured. Here is the case
in point.

Extensive renovation has been
going on in all three of the
buildings of the Life Science
complex in Clapp, Langley and
Crawford Halls. Several projects
are attended to simultaneously by
one crew of electricians. Consider-
ing the rush to complete the
renovations, were proper safety
checks made? Could errors have
gone unattended? The implication
here is not to fault a possible error
with the tragedy. but to point to a
need for investigation. The city

maintains that building permits are
required for any renovations in the

city.

the '

maintains Pitt has a special
relationship with city planning
department which disclaims the
permit requirement. If the proper
permits were not issued. was the
safety of the work properly
guaranteed?

The university contends that the
installation of a new transformer in
Crawford Hall was too far removed
from the blast site to be of serious
consequence. This is true. but
what the university has failed to
make public is that: 1) Before the
power could be shut down for
hookup of the transformer, a lab on
the first floor of Crawford Hall had
to be supplied with electricity from
Langley Hall. 2) The hookup was
made from Dr. Cowgill’s lab to a
terminal with sufﬁcient power flow
in or near the immediate blast site.
Cables were suspended from the
ceiling of the Langley Hall garage
and seen at least 40 feet from the
blast site. 3) The University has
not indicated where the cables
could have been hooked up to. 4)
The electron microscope suite had

a switching box capable of handling I

the load. 5) Occupants of Crawford
Hall at the time of the blast
reported a very short period of time
between the time electricity was
turned back on and the time of the
explosion. One occupant of the hall
reports the time as one minute. 6)
The University has failed
acknowledge any of the publicly,
and instead is reporting ‘as likely’
the possibility of a lit cigarette as
the cause of the spark.

All this makes it difficult to
believe the university is conducting
a complete investigation. It

certainly is not an open one. Could .-

assessment of liability be the
cause? .

Secrecy is not in the best interest
of students. staff and faculty who
occupy university buildings, es-
pecially those buildings under
rennovation. Does the university
care to conduct an open investiga-
tion or should this task be left to the

New Office To Spur Research

BY NANCY J. WINTNER

Pitt’s new Office of Research will
provide enormous services to
faculty members and will help
increase the University’s funded
research, newly appointed Assoc-
iate Provost‘ Alan E. Fisher said
recently.

Fisher, who heads the new office,
said he will attempt to bring
together faculty members from
various schools within the Univer-

' sity who have expertise in similar
areas. These people will be
interested in generating similar
research proposals and will work
together rather than individually,
he said.

“If there would be a nucleus of
people like this,” Fisher said, who
also is chairman of Pitt’s psychobio-
logy program, “our writers would
be available to put a proposal
together.”

Fisher said the development and
production of major research
proposals are handled in the
Research Service Center, one of
three subdivisions of the new
research office.

The two other subdivisions--The
Liason and Information Services
Department and the Research and
Sponsored Project Administration
—provide their own special ser-
vices.

The Liason and Information
Department will gather information
concerning the types of funding
available and will transmit its
ﬁndings to those people interested
in generating proposals.

Fisher said his goal is to establish
a “more focused system” where
faculty members will insert their
ideas into a computer and let the
computer determine what proposals
are feasible and the costs involved.

The Research and Sponsored
Project Administration deals with

, the whole issue of indirect costs,

budget guidelines and revenue
related to research projects. Fisher
said all proposals must be
negotiated or approved by members

in this office before the proposals
can be pursued any further.

An advantage of this ofﬁce, he
said, is that faculty members won’t
have to work on an individual basis

and much time will be saved. Fisher
said preparing for an individual
research project is like “getting
yourself ready for a heavyweight
championship.”

‘ ‘It can really be a hassle, ’ ’ Fisher
said, ‘ ‘if you have to spend three out
of six months trying to obtain funds,
because you get to the point where
you lose track of your real goal.

‘ ‘My first and highest priority will
try to make life_ easier for faculty
members,” Fisher said.

Asked if this office is another step
towards a more research-oriented
University, Fisher said “no.

“Any university feels research is
one of its central priorities. That’s

what deﬁnes it as a university—the a

generation‘ of new knowledge or
information,” he said.

Fisher said Pitt’s Psychobiology
Department—recognized as one of
the best in the country—has faculty
members who are “excellent
teachers” as well as researchers.

“It isn’t necessarily true that
their highest priority is research
and they won’t be effective
teachers. ‘It doesn’t mean they’re
divorced from their students. They
are very good at -their ﬁeld and
students give them motivation to
obtain knowledge.”

Fisher said that “new informa-
tion is produced all the time” and
faculty members present current
materialsas opposed to using a
textbook which may be outdated.

Fisher added the Office of
Research may attract more profes-
sional researchers or able-bodied
professors.

“The atmosphere in the Univer-
sity is an exciting place relative to
research and you can identify the
strengths that might attract more
people. Our faculty has a real
commitment to teaching three to
four substance courses relative to
scientiﬁc areas,” he said.

Fisher said the Ofﬁce of Research
isn’t new. It previously existed in
the University as separate depart-
ments. It wasn’t until recently that
the University realized a real
integrated system was needed to
consider all aspects of research
problems, he said. ’

added that the ﬁgures given were
for those repairs that Westinghouse
concluded were caused by vandal-
ism. The ﬁgure also includes
equipment stolen while repairmen
were working on the elevators.
Dalton said that the damage usually
occurs from overloading and using
objects to prop open the elevator
doors. Although in the past fights
on the elevators have been a major
cause of damage, Dalton says this
was not the case during the past
term -

Other listings included windows
($630.92), doors ($1,146.03), furni-
ture ($326.S4), ﬁre extinquishers
($283.75) and lights ($237.88).

“I would say that the way to cut
down on the amount of damage is
that the students be aware that their
actions and the actions of their
neighbors is the major cause,”
Dalton said.

The ﬁgures were compiled by the
damage control committee, a
subsidiary of the Resident Student
Association (RSA). The RSA
founded the committee to prevent a
damage deposit being charged to all
resident students.

SHAPP ASKS EMERGENCY
STATUS

HARRISBURG (AP)—Gov.
Shapp said yesterday he has asked
President Carter to declare an
emergency in Pennsylvania and
give it excess natural gas supplies
from other states.

The governor acted as the state's
fuel shortage worsened steadily.

In Philadelphia, Mayor Frank
Rizzo declared a state of emergency
and ordered the city-owned gas
works to curtail industrial and

V commercial users.

At least three counties in western
Pennsylvania were facing a critical
shortage of home heating oil and
gas companies increased curtail-
ments of natural gas.

Throughout the state, thousands
of additional workers faced layoffs
due to the energy crisis.

The Public Utility Commission on
Thursday night urged all commer-
cial‘ ﬁrms to severely curtail use of
heating fuels, especially natural
gas.

The ﬁve PUC members issued a
statement asking that operating
hours be cut back at all food and
drug stores, laundromats, dry
cleaning stores. theaters, sporting

arenas, restaurants, nightclubs,
libraries and museums.

Rizzo declared an emergency
after a federal judge refused to rule
on the city’s court suit seeking
restoration of its daily 23.4 million
cubic—foot gas delivery from a Texas
pipeline company.

BETTER MUSHROOMS THAN
COLD

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP)—-
Gov. Jay Rockefeller said yesterday
that West Virginia was better
prepared for a nuclear attack than
the crisis brought on by unending
cold, snow and shortages of natural
gas.

“When I walked in this office, I
expected to ﬁnd a plan and found
none,” said the governor, who is in
his second week in office. “I found
a plan for nuclear attack, and I don't
ﬁnd that very helpful right now.”

I TRICKY BARGES TO MOVE

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)--The
Army Corps of Engineers began a
“very hazardous. extraordinary
maneuver" yesterday aimed at

moving barges loaded with millions ,
g of gallons of fuel oil over three dams

on the frozen Ohio River. I

Corps spokesman Chuck Schu-
man said the decision was made
“because of the fuel crisis in
Pennsylvania and Ohio.’ ’
' Many homes are running out of
fuel in southwestern Pennsylvania,
an area which gets most of its fuel
oil from the Ohio River barges.

Schumann said the process of
increasing the water level near the
three dams by raising their
wickets—or gates——could take two

    Aiming For Law School?

BY YAIER LEHRER
. So you want to go to law school,
huh? Tell that to any first-year law
student and you’ll probably receive
a very nervous laugh in the face.

cThen he'll make the suggestion

that you pursue another career,
such as janitor, public relations
director for Idi Amin, or elocution
instructor for Jimmy Carter. .In
other words, just about anything
else- ' :

Why would aperson who. spent
“all those yearsiin undergraduate
school aiming to go to law school
and waited impatiently day after
day for that magic acceptance,
suddenly become such a cynic?

That’s a good question. As a
matter of fact, there are a lot of
good questions asked in class every
day. Most professors are willing to
recognize the fact that you’ve
asked a good question. That, of
course, doesn't mean that they're
willing to answer.

Instead of giving an intelligent
answer to a good question, a
professor will invariably come back
with a “What do you think?” all

» the while realizing that if you had

known the answer you never would
have asked the question. Educa-
tors refer to this as the Socratic
method. Normal people call it a
cop-out. V
The Socratic method is a
remarkable way, to learn. If one has
prepared adequately for a class,
. has all his briefs concisely written,
and feels that he understands the

if material ideally he should leave the

classroon an enlightened future
lawyer. Ideally. that is.

In most cases, the most prepared
of students will walk into a class, sit
and absorb pearls of wisdom and
then leave the class knowing less
than he did when he entered.

LA RUE, CHEF EXTRAORDINAIR

1 College students are notoriously
‘poor, destitute creatures who often
“have to resort to eating sub-canine
food just to survive. But they are
also very inventive, and have
concocted an endless array of
scrumptuous dishes from the most
basic ingredients. Here is a recipe
for one such taste-treat. You might
want to add it to your own cookbook.

BEANSALA WIENER
Ingredients: one can of baked
beans (without the can), two hot
dogs, a couple of potatoes and
onions, and anything else you can
get your paws on.
Step 1. Dump the beans into a
. pot; preferably, the pot you used for
last night’s rigatoni. Remember—
‘anything goes. -
Step 2. Cut the first hot dog into
neat. evenly spaced little slices. Eat

I them. Tasty little critters, aren't

they? Throw the other hot dog into
the pot. Mash with fork.

. \NV~33

 

In order to overcome the
handicap of the inefﬁcient Socratic
method, many students spend
hours upon hours in the library.
The library is akin to a holy shrine
for hard-working, dedicated law
students. If a student says he’s
going to the library, you know he
means business. 6

The most dedicated of these
spend every waking non-class hour
in the library, eating lunch and
dinner with their noses in the
fascinating study of property and
the ramifications of a conditional
delivery of a deed in escrow.

These are men and women
driven by an inner desire to excel
and become great scholars. These
people usually become professors.

On the other hand, many
not-so-driven students also spend
many hours in the library. They
have- a different force driving
them—paranoia.

The fear of getting called on in
class is a great one. A professor
will want to go’ over a particular
case so he will call on a student

' from his roll sheet; more often than

not mispronouncing the name.

“Mr, uh, Baker, would you
please tell us , about Hamer v.
Sidway?," a professor will ask

ever-so-innocently (while leering
over the top of his glasses.
preparing to dissect the student's
brief and at thesame time attempt
to make his victim appear like a
total jackass).

Following the student's stating

of the case, comes the question-'

and-attempted answer period.
“What _was the court really
trying to do here. Mr. Baker?”
“Well, uh, it seems that the
intention of the court is to, uh.
deter this type of conduct.”

Step 3. Toss potatoes and onions
against the wall, scoring one point
for every time you catch a
rebounding potato and two points
for each onion. Scrape the winning
vegetable off the wall and return it
to the shelf—for tomorrow’ s dinner.

his face, feeling he has given a
good answer. To which the
professor gives the most frustrat-
ing reply possible...

“So what?”

Frustration and confusion are the
weapons used by the law school
professor, usually with amazing
success. The best manifestation of
those weapons is in the law school
exam. “

The law school exam contains a
carefully designed situation that is
harder to untangle than the plotline
of a daytime television serial.
Within that situation are more
legal problems than F. Lee Bailey
could solve in ﬁve hours. The law
student is given ‘one hour for this
type of question.

If one were to watch students
leaving a room where they have
just taken an exam, he would think
that he had stumbled upon a
zombie farm. The blank expres-
sions indicating totally drained
minds are universal. A group of
students will manage to form
outside the room when suddenly
someone will break the dead
silence. ‘

“What did you think?" he asks
the person nearest to him.

“I know I failed,” he answered
as everyone else nods, silently
agreeing. “The only thing left to
do is get totally wasted," at which
point they all exit to the nearest bar

Trivia Time
BY MARK PRESCOTT
Unfortunately, many people con-
sidered my last trivia quiz to be a
fairly easy one. Some of my friends
even went so far as to say that they
laughed all the way through the quiz
because itwas so simple for them.
So, for all those readers who would
prefer a slightly harder test, I hope

this one suffices. ’
1. What is the longest-running

Broadway play of all time? And if ,

you are a real trivia buff, what is the
second—longest running play?

2. See if you can remember the
names of the three former lead
singers ‘of the rock group Deep
Purple. For an extra bonus point,

B which one of these three starred in

the musical Jesus Christ Superstar?

3. Which professional baseball
team has the largest stadium, in
terms of seating capacity, and
which has the smallest?

4. Before the formation of
Emerson, Lake & Palmer: with what
groups did Greg Lake and Keith
Emerson each play?

5. Who won the’ Oscar for best
actor in 1967 for his performance in
the movie, In The Heat of The
Night? . ‘

6. Name the four stars of the
movie Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf: For the real expert, which
one of the four won the Oscar for
their performance in that movie?

7. Everyone knows Secretariat
won the Triple Crown ,of horse
racing in 1973. but what was the
name of the horse that wasjthe last
to do it before Secretariat? Also.
what famous jockey rode this horse
to victory?

 

and discuss alternative careers
over pitchers of beer.
A Some of those law students will
drop out; butmost will stick it out,
driven by God-know-s-what.

So the next time a law student
tries to dissuade yoii from pursuing

a law career, remindhim that
Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Spiro
_o;-new, John Ehrlichman and Fred
Shero (Coach of the Philadelphia
Flyers) were able to survive the
trauma. And if they could,
anybody can.

Posvar Talks Football

Wes’ Fond

BY KAREN KADILAK

_Nearly a month has passed since
Pitt rolled to its impressive win over
Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.

Yet, the memories of that contest
are as vivid in Pitt Chancellor
Wesley Posvar’s mind as if they
happened yesterday.

“,1, was relieved to see us go that
far. Posvar said in his office
recently. “I was satisﬁed and quite
elated.”

J ustiﬁably so.

Since coming to Pitt in 1967, the
Chancellor. reportedly “the num-
ber one Panther backer,” has seen
his share of some pretty bad
Panther football .teams.

Now, he’s witnessing Pitt’s
meteoric rise from the bottom to the
top and enjoying the fruits of the
hard labor that went into Pitt’s
finally attaining that enviable
position of numero uno.

“It took several years to make
changes here at Pitt,” Posvar
pointed out. “Sometimes things
didn't always go that smoothly, but
we knew if we worked hard things
would start going in the right
direction.’ ’

And things, naturally, have done
just that, although the Chancellor
was quick to point out thatit wasn’t
an overnight thing responsible for
Pitt’s storied rise in the football
world. -

“It wasn’t that sudden of a
change,” Posvar stated. “There’s
been a lot of hard work involved in
this program. It’s been four tough
years.”

Indeed it was. But, just the same,
it’s been four memorable years, too.
Thethard work is worth it, especially
when your’re sitting pretty on top of
the football stockpile.

WEATHER CRISIS

HARRISBURG (AP)—Here is
the text of Gov. Shapp’s television
address on the energy crisis: .

“I have taken the extreme action
of requesting this time tonight
because the natural gas situation in
Pennsylvania has continued to
deteriorate.

“If we do not take severe measures
during the next few days we may
find ourselves in a truly catastrophic
situation. ‘

“It is not my intention to alarm
you. If we pull together and
cooperate we will probably make it
through this crisis.

Just a short while ago I left my
office in Harrisburg where I have
been in constant deliberations with
the entire ﬁve-member Public
Utility Commission. Their report to
me is very pessimistic.”

Memories

For Posvar, there have been some
especially sweet moments. Two of
those especially memorable events
occured this past season.

Posvar numbers Tony Dorsett’s
61-yard touchdown run against
Notre Dame in the season opener as
one of his fondest memories.

The Heisman Trophy winner is
also involved in another of Posvar’s
list of fondest memories.

The Chancellor will never forget
T.D.’s record—shattering game
against.Navy. That’s the game in
which Dorsett became the all-time
collegiate rushing champion.

It’s not all that ironic that
Posvar’s fondest memories involve
Dorsett. Not at all when you
consider the praise Posvar showers
upon what is now the hottest
commodity on the pro football
market.

“I'le’s a very high-caliber young
man. Posvar pointed out. “He’s
handled himself very well in light of
all the publicity he’s gotten. He's
matured tremendously.”

So has the Pitt football program.
After a season like this past season,
there's little reason why the
memories shouldn’t still be vivid in
Posvar’ s ‘mind. '

Friday, January 28, 1977-THE PITT NEWS—Page 9

Chancellor Posvar is shown here with Coach Johnny Majors, savoring

I the Panther’s victory in the Sun Bowl last year. At the time, he had no

idea that his fondest football memories would be of the next year...the
year the Panthers ranked "#1 in the country. '

ELECTRONIC MAIL

WASHINGTON (AP)—-Trans-
mitting letters electronically from
city to city rather than carrying
them physically could help the
deﬁcit-plagued U.S. Postal Service
cut costs and improve service, a
government-sponsored study re-
ported Thursday.

The National Academy of Scien-
ces committee report recommended
the Postal Service develop limited
electronic message services and
assess whether the public reaction
warrants a nationwide system.

“Time is running out for the
Postal Service. While it delays its
entry into electronic message
services, developments by private
ﬁrms are sure to proceed, possibly
foreclosing any opportunities for
the Postal Service to move into the
ﬁeld in any meaningful way,” the
report said.

Under an electronic mail system,
messages could be transmitted
electronically between post ofﬁces
and a printed copy then delivered to
the recipient. Electronic trans-
mission would eliminate the cost of
sorting letters and transporting
them.

The Postal Service, which is $2.8
billion in the red, is considering
establishing electronic mail service.

The service’s future currentlylis

under study by a special commis-»

sion, which will recommend options
to Congress by March 15.

PMAP Ready to aid Students

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

“It’s peers helping peers,”
explained Tom Ricci, a director of
the Medical Action Committee’s

7 (MAC) Peer Medical Aide Program

(PMAP). ‘ ‘We think it’s easier for a
student with a problem to talk to a
peer instead of a doctor. But if it’s a
serious problem, we can refer them
to the right source.”

MAC president Ken Spear began
toying with the concept of PMAP
last spring when he read about a

similar program at Princeton. MAC '

received an okay from the student

 ‘health service and developed the
’ ‘program over the summer.

~-“Programs such as this have
always been conceived and impli-
mented by the health services and
administration-—never by student
groups,” said Spear‘, explaining the
uniqueness of PMAP.

While MAC has provided numer-
ous clinics in the past, Spear said
that this is “the first time MAC has
really gotten into the medical
field.” —

‘Specifically, what PMAP involves

A is -a group of students trained

throughout a term (approximately
80 hours) in first aid procedures.

This includes advanced Red Cross
first aid, cardiopulmonary resus-
citation, emergency care and

,handling, psychological emergen-

cies and health education and
evaluation.‘
When the program was ﬁrst put

into effect during fall term, Health

Educator Gerry Hyner, primary
instructor for PMAP, taught a
group of 18 students, including
PMAP co-directors Lynn A Bliman
and Ricci. This term, the ranks have
swollen to 24 students (40 applied)

I _ and with the directors able to aid in

the instructing, Hyner says the
program is more organized.
PMAP also has weekend hours
from Fridays at 11 p.m. to Monday
morning at 8, to provide services
while the health center is closed.

Spear says that MAC is developing]

an emergency paramedic group,
“utilizing existing paramedics and
emergency medical technologists in
the Oakland area (though _ not
necessarily students). Someday we
hope to combine PMAP and the new
group.”

PMAP’s effectiveness and effic-
iency was revealed at the site of the
January 20 Langley Hall disaster,
but, ironically, it was not the
group’s medical skills that proved
the greatest asset. Arriving at the
scene minutes after the explosion,
PMAP members immediately
began to organize the crowds that
surrounded the building making it

a nearly impossible for emergency

vehicles and trained professionals
to get through to the injured
students.

“We're the only ones who worked
on crowd control,” said PMA Joel
Cohen. “Members of PMAP were
there before the police.”

Du-e to the possibility of a third
explosion with ﬂying shrapnel,
Cohen said, it was a dangerous
situation “even across the street.”

Meanwhile, the MAC . office
turned into an information service.
Members were sent to classrooms
across campus to inform students of
the situation. The ‘office received

information from hospitals and

bloodbanks, and was kept open
until after midnight handling the
incoming calls.

It was mass cooperation from
different organizations that made it

possible, according to Spear. Both
the Student Government and Legal
Awareness offices cancelled all
business and allowed MAC to use
their phones. Meanwhile, PMAP
staffed the student health service
from Thursday night on through the
weekend.

One thing sticks in the mind, in
thesedays of malpractice suits—
can a PMA be sued? The answer is
yes and no. Members of PMAP are
covered under Pennsylvania’ s Good
Samaritan Act while they are on
duty.

“Medical care, in general, is
composed of quality, quantity and
understanding,” Spear summed it
up. “And PMAP, having the first
two, puts its largest emphasis on
understanding. Which is exactly
students helping students.”

CAT SAVES SIX LIVES

OVERLAND PARK, Kan.

v(AP)——Wayne L. Hill awoke in bed , .

yesterday morning to ﬁnd . the
family cat meowin g anxiously on his
chest.

Hill, 40, said he smelled smoke
and found the kitchen dense with it
and the attached garage on ﬁre.

He awakened his wife, Diane, 39,
and their four children, Jeff, 14;
Kristi, 13; Kevin, 11, and Andrea,
4, and led them to safety. The only
casualty was the family dog which

’ perished in the garage.

“We sure owe our lives to that
cat,” Hill said. “If it hadn’t jumped
on me we might have all been
overcome by smoke.”

Cry of the Wolf

Wolf Power——That’s the rallying
cry these days behind a fast-
growing movement to have the wolf
designated our national mammal.

It all began last spring at the,

instigation of Mary E. Trindal. She
sees the wolf, whose numbers are
decreasing drastically via human
slaughter, as a symbol of the plight
of all creatures threatened with
extinction. By having the wolf
proclaimed our national mammal,
it will prove we do have a reverence
of life.

One million signatures are
needed before either the president
or congress can be approached.

Knowing the concern of our young
people over. our dying environment
we are asking for their support.
This is a grass roots endeavor. The
wolf will be your permanent elected
lobbyist on the hill representing,
not only our animal friends, but
those who care about them.

The campaign to have the wolf
designated our national mammal is
supported by: The Fund For
Animals. Defenders of Wildlife,
Society of Humane Legislation, Inc.
and The North American Wildlife
Park Foundation, Battle Ground,
Indiana. ‘ '

them, explained Savina Skewis,
former Associate Dean of Women at
the University of Pittsburgh. She
continued about women’s advance-
ment in recent years:

“There’s still a gray area where

4» men and women need to understand

each other.”
Skewis still works to provide a

learning situation for men and‘

But her kitchen is not a place for
groups to gather for a quick meal.
It’s to be used as a learning
experience.

“Civilities are important,” she
said. “As we have expanded
education and combined every-
body, the students want formal
experiences which should be
provided. Students need someone
who cares about that sort of thing. ’ ’

Skewis doesn’t know what the '

future holds for Vera Heinz’
twelfth-ﬂoor gift. The University
wants to hold onto it, she said. The
administration realizes it is a
positive area.

“It’s up to the students to get
together. If they want a total
development which includes taking
a placein a changing society where
consideration of each other still
counts then they’re going to have to
ask for it.”

Is Th/ereA Feminist Art?

BYDEANNALOUISE
“Feminist art does not exist, but
feminist statements abound,” part-
time artist and academic advisor
Susanne Downie said during the
Women’s Cultural Festival yes-
terday.
Contemporary female painters

   
   

' uzanne Downie discussed the
art of women in a workshop held
yesterday as part of the Women’s
Cultural Festival. Wolfe photo
Downie said, produce many cen-
tralized images deriving from
circles, “cunt” symbolism as
termed by its founders, (a word
choice often questioned by femin-
ists). ~
Lucy Lippard, who managed “2
Contemporary Women Artists,” a
1911 exhibit at the Aldrich Museum
in Connecticut and a landmark
showing‘ in female art history,
explained it further: “a uniform
density, an overall texture, often
sensuously tactile and often repeti-
tive to the point of obsession; the

preponderance of circular forms

and central focus.”

A paradigms of this is Georgia
0’Keefe’s “Through the Flower,”
a painting of a black iris as viewed
with the eye pressed against the
opening of the fully blossomed
ﬂower. —

“Men can make feminist state-

Women In ﬁlm:

ments too,” Downie said. “But
they rarely do because they
have little psychological potential.

Markedly, but not without
exception, women’s painting shows
more sensibility and ﬂow in curved
lines than men’s‘ art work.

Judy Chicago’s “Pasadina Life
Savers” demonstrates a pure form
of the theory she founded along with
Miriam Shapiero several years ago.

Four octagonals with circles ﬁtted .

inside test within the squares of a
quartered box. Chicago has said the
piece represents many orgasms.

Downie disagreed, like several
other art experts including Leonard
Alloway.

“When the curvature is reduced
to a pure geometric circle,” Downie
said about Chicago’s painting, ‘ ‘it’s

no longer centralized imagery
because there is not enough,
elaboration to infer a female

statement.”

Chicago’s painting approaches
this pure state.

“As the image approaches a

purity there’s a greater probability

a man drew it,” she added.
If female artists are more visible

/——Women In The .

than they were ﬁve years ago it’s
because they developed co-ops like
the Art Workers Coalition of 1969,
Women in the Arts and the
Women’s Interart Center in 19.71 to
organize independent exhibits as an
alternative to museum exhibits
which typiﬁed the art system.

“The art museums made it
difﬁcult for women painters to gain
entrance into their cliques,”
Downie said.

“Although women are more
liberated today, their equality with
men in art is an ideal,” Downie
said. “They’ve been denied the
same opportunity to develop their
talents and partake in open
exchange with male artists.”

Women were excluded from
nude-model sessions until the
twentieth century. The conse-
quences being they couldn’t
produce the most revered form of
art, at the time, historial paintings.

Several top-notch artists, includ-
ing Alida Walsh, Inverna, Kate
Millet, Nancy Spero, Sara Sapor-
eta, and Lucia Vernarelli, emerged
from the ’70s cooperatives.

What will emerge from the ’80s"

e

For today and Monday the arts pages are devoted solely to articles,
reviews and essays on women artists. We’ve pushed ahead scheduled
articles so that this special report can appear in conjunction with the
Women’s Cultural Festival sponsored by the University Women’s

Center.

Not one of the artists discussed here, not those appearing at the poorly
publicized Festival, are the woman artist as symbol. None represent
others. They may have common ideas, and their art may be inﬂuenced
by a common experience, but none can be considered more (or indeed,

less) than individuals.

To discuss women artists together, as womenartists, is not to negate
their individuality, not to place the burden of a cause upon their art.
Certainly the cause exists, but it is not always the only motivation for an

artwork.

The art of women can be discussed collectively because women (and
with them, thank God, men) have experienced changing roles and have

acquired new visions collectively.

Women Making Films:
‘Centering’ The Self

BY MREA CSORBA

lingering male stronghold in the
artistic arena; a technical artwhose
required machinery may have

from entering it.

K film

 

Going, Going,I\/laybe Cone  

BY M. C. PILECKI

When one is approached on
the subject of “women in film,”
the strictly commercial, ‘ ‘establish-

.ment” ﬁlm, the ﬁrst response is

“where?”

K Where are the women in ﬁlms?
' There have been few in front of the

camera, and far fewer behind.

Although women comprise 51 per
cent of the population, the fact is
hardly evident by what one sees on
the screen, at least from Holly-
wood.

In just about every amass
medium-—ﬁlm, television, theatre,
even commercials——parts for men
have been outnumbering parts for
women. And good parts for women
are even rarer. But in the last
decade or so, the dearth of
women’s roles have led many wags
to ‘insist that actresses be put on
the endangered species list.
Others have warned that the

various acting awards for women
would soon be absolete. .

What is really ironic is that this
near-elifnination of women from
the screen seemed to coincide with
the latest feminist movement,
begun in the mid-sixties. If any era
should have brought more women
into the screen arts, this should
have been it, right?

It didn't work that way. By the
early seventies, _there were fewer
women working in all facets of ﬁlm
than in the thirties;

and 40’s and have retained their star status while younger actresses,
such as Barbra Streisand and Karen Black, of more recent times have
found good roles for women to be rare.

actresses. There were more female
writers, directors. etc. during and
after the Great Depression than
there were during the alleged
prosperity of the Vietnam era.
What happened? Well, look
back ﬁrst to the '30s. Women were
still riding the crest of an earlier
wave of feminism, the one that
gave us equal suffrage and less
cumbersome clothes. Then came

the war (you remember-the big
one, WWII). With more and mo.e
men moving into the ﬁght (many
from Hollywood). women moved
into more jobs all over the country
(including Hollywood).

footage by women, and industry is
always the last to throw support into
an untested venture. The
film-making movement among
women is still at the grass-roots
level, with support gleaned mostly
from small, sympathetic organiza-
tions like Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

Centering, Carol Katonik’s
seven-minute ﬁlm (showing today
between two and ﬁve p.m. as one of
several women’ s ﬁlms presented by
the Women’s Cultural Festival), is
the happy result of such co-opera-
tion. Katonik wrote, shot,
developed and edited the ﬁlm,
using the facilities on Oakland
Avenue.

‘Centering’ is the process of
positioning wedged clay on the
exact center of the potter wheel's
surface, a process._ necessary to
produce a wholesome and func-
tional ware. In the ﬁlm, the idea of
centering doubles as symbol for
woman’ s need’ to solidify, or center
herself. Visually, we see the
making of a pot. The sound track
speaks of the borrowed Zen
Buddhist philosophy of Japanese
potters that encourages the working

Funny Women Getting 
LaughsAnd Titters’

Br MAGGIE McKAY
TITTERS

Edited by Deanne Stillman and
Anne Beatts
MacMillan, paperback, $7.95

Titters is billed as ‘the ﬁrst
collection of humor by women. It is
not, the editors stress, a book of
women’s humor. What constitutes
“women’s humor” is a debateable
point, but nonetheless,_Titters is
heavily oriented towards topics that
interest and amuse women.

It is a parody of women’s culture
decked out in National Lampoon
It abounds with bawdy
poems, comic strips, cut-out dolls,
samplers and songs; all under the
headings: Knockers, Mellons,
Jugs, Hooters, Bongos, Headlights
and Boobs.

Some male readers may ﬁnd it
hard to relate to the humor of the
70-odd pieces. Men who ﬁnd jokes
about dumb blondes, jock straps
and big boobs hysterically funny
may be particularly uncomfortable
seeing women themselves poking
fun at sex, men and The Total
Woman.

Among other things, the book
takes a broad swipe at current
“women’s magazines” from Play-
girl and True Confessions to
Glamour and Ms. “Fake Confes-
sious (a dumb publication)" flaunts
heady teasers as “My Bad Karma
by Rose Kennedy" and “Strange
Voices Commanded Me to Send

Gerald Ford A -Pair of Wax Lips. I
knew it was wrong, but what would
you do?”

Contributors to the collection
range from commedienne Phyllis
Diller, Peg Bracken (The I Hate to
Cook Cookbook), to Helen Lawren-
son (author of the infamous “Latins
Make Lousy Lovers’ ’) and relatively
unknown writers and commedien-

nes as Lynda Crawford and Mimi
Kennedy.

Editors Deanne Stillman and
Anne Beatts, who wrote a number
of pieces, may be familiar to some
readers.

Stillman was the founding editor
of Bitch, the ﬁrst humor magazine
for women and a co-founder of

They weren't great, most of them.

I The end of the war, of course,
brought a strange longing ‘for

women left their jobs to tie on
agons. But there were still
roles——at least in front of the
cameras—for women. Movies
were still the main source oi
entertainment, and the main

war, assassination, riots, and all
the other fun things we'll soon call
nostalgic. movies of necessity
broke with the old codes. Real
gore—and real sex——were now part
of the movies. Realism was the
key, the thing thought to bring in
those waning crowds.

And, simply stated, not much of
reality included women. The
“movers” s in life were men.
Therefore the movies were about
men. Now unshackled from the old
movie cliches, boy no longer had to

ships, male conflicts, male prob-
lems. Naturally. Since by this time
there were few (if any) women

Liza Minnelli, one of the few successful film actresses of this decade,
is, like hercontemporaries, unable to find many good roles in good films.

storyline for the movies was boy
meets girl.

Thus, logically speaking, one
had to have ._a girl in the ﬁlm.
Alfred Hitchcock once remarked
that that was sometimes the
hardest part of a movie——ﬁguring
out how to get the girl in there. But
they got in, all right, and continued
to grace the screen in parts that
gnged from insulting to terriﬁc.
But women were working, anyway.

Then in the sixties, in the
general upheaval brought on by

the men who ran the movies
created their reality in their own
image.

Of course, there was still a call
for ‘sex. True, every screen era had
its “sex goddesses,” actresses
with more bustline than talent in
many cases, but now the case was
different. In the “new realism” of
the sixties and seventies, the sex

male star. And too often the

skin, roll in bed and fade out. In
most cases, one couldn’t even
remember who the actress was, or
what she looked like.

Not helping the situation was the
rise of the “cheekbone actresses,”
former models already proven to be
photogenic but sadly at a loss as to
how to “emote." After all, if
women were supposed to be only
pretty objects anyway, why not just
get women who made a living
being pretty objects. Who really
cared if Ali MacGraw, Cybill
Shepherd, et al., could act‘! Did
they need to?

The situation with women and
ﬁlms was getting so bad that just a
few years ago a movie called Alice
Doesn’t Live Here Anymore
created quite a stir. It was
practically hailed as a treatise to
the modern woman, -and was
considered a milestone in women’s
film image.

Okay, the ﬁlm was well done. It
had a good cast and fine writing
and—rarest of all——was a movie
about 3 woman. But when you
really looked at the ﬁlm, what was
the hullabaloo about? The story
was about a newly widowed woman

V who, with her child, starts to travel

cross-country to fulﬁll a lifelong
dream of being a professional
singer and seeking nirvana. On the
way sheyruns into problems, and is
ﬁnally sidetracked permanently
from her dream by another
marriage, painted as the real
nirvana. I
Except for the brusque

language, this was‘ strictly a
“woman’s picture” straight out of
the forties. A woman on her own
ﬁnally ﬁnds real happiness with a
man. End of problem. ’

ting editor. She left the Lampoon in
1974 because “chicks just aren’t
funny.” She recently won an emmy
as a writer on NBC’s Saturday
Night.

Titters is at its irreverent best
when dealing with pieces such as
Florence King’s “Roll Me Over,
Lay Me Down, ’ ’ a witty treatment of
sex in the ’50s such as would never
be seen on Happy Days. “The
Sylvia Plath Cookbook,” complete
with a picture of a woman with her
head thrust into an oven, elicits a

few furtive chuckles and groans.

Reprints of pieces by writers such
as Peg Bracken and Phyllis
McGinley, although funny, seem to
be pale, genteel works of feminist
Americana beside the cruder, more
corrosive works of the younger
women inthe collection.

Scattered throughout the book
are deft burlesques of ads for love
potions, diet aids, Mark Eden Bust
developers (“Girls, Were You
Absent When Mother Nature
Passed Out The Jugs?”) and the
familiar, to women, Tampaig
instructions, (“Clampax Pon-
toons.”)

If Titters greatest advantage is a
feminine view of subjects male
humorists have ignored or failed to
portray, it is less than stellar when
the writers focus‘ on guides to
“Black Slang” and “Feminish.”
Both languages have been belabor-
ed in popular magazines more than
the Southern slang and Georgian
jargon of the Carter administration.

The humor H also flops when

satirizing novels and novelists.
Many of the cartoons are ﬂatly

juvenile and fail to arouse much

interest. One outstanding cartoon,
however, was “Eloise Returns” by
Janie Gaynor and Peggy Goldman.
The stand-up routines, monologues
and “Take my husband please”
jokes also wear pretty thin.
When reading Titters, one should
stave off the impulse to rush
through it in one sitting. Taken in
huge lumps, materials that is
sometimes too silly and very
outrageous dulls the palate. Titters
is best enjoyed one morsel at a time.

The movie. for all its qualities,
was hardly a milestone. As
propaganda, it was very much
opposed to the idea of the “new
woman." Alice just couldn’t make
it without a husband. This was a
modern story?

Films———Hollywood, anyway-
take time to catch up to the national
mood. But more women—in
trickles, perhaps-——are entering the
scene as directors. producers.
writers, etc. With them come more
stories about women, or at least
stories that involve women. True,
looking at the track records of

Elaine May, Lina Wertmuller, Julia -

Phillips, et al., one is not
impressed by a rush to show
women on the screen. In fact. of
the three ladies mentioned, their
greatest successes were movies
centering on men (The Heartbreak
Kid, Seven Beauties, etc., The
Sting, respectively).

But the question always comes
down to what actresses are being
shown on the silver screen. ls it
even important? Perhaps this is an
overestimation of the power of ﬁlm,
but the answer is yes.

Movies (and their lesser corol-
lary, television) areprime media.
They‘re pervasive, and somewhat
persuasive in convincing us that

the tales they tell really reflect
reality. as it is or should be. If
women——and perhaps more impor-
tantly. girls——see other women on
the screen, it might lead to some
thinking. Not seeing women in
mass‘ culture reinforces the old
belief that women just don't count.

Like it or not, actresses tend to
get lumped more into those
“admired women” lists than
scientists, political leaders,
writers,-‘etc. They're more visible.
Of late therehave been very few
new actresses cropping up.
Quick—name ﬁve who have made
it big since 1970. Uh-huh.

The industry seems’ ready for a

turnaround. True, women in ﬁlm‘

are still on a far from equal
standing. but for the first time in
years, most of the major films of
the year at least featured actresses
in somewhatstarring roles. True,

the traditional grande dames=‘

ﬁzzled—like Elizabeth Taylor, Liza

Minnelli, Jane Fonda and Ingrid;

Bergman. But a few ladies, like
Audrey Hepburn, Piper Laurie and
Lee Remick, madejsolid returns to
the screen. And then there’s the
growth of the newer actresses——
Carol Kane, Sissy Spacek, Jodie
Foster, Barbara "Harris, Jessica
Harper, Jill Clayburgh—and of
course, more established stars:
Barbara Streisand, Faye Dunaway,
Karen Black and Genevieve Bujold.

When one looks at 1976 in
comparison to the. recent past.
things look very good for women in
that highly commercial art. This is
hardly to say that women have it
good, or even as good as it once
was. '

Irish ‘Bound By Panthers,

BY cius HALL

SOUTH BEND, Indiana-—If you

were a Pitt basketball fan who took
the Panthers, and the 21 points the
bookies were giving-them, Saturday
night, there were mixed tidings for
you from Notre Dame’s blessed but
blustery campus.

The good news and the bad news:

You won your bet. Barely.

The Fighting Irish (9-5), thanks to

a 56-29 rebounding edge and a
balanced attack, were able to erase
an early seven-point Pitt lead and
whip the Panthers, 88-68, at the

Athletic and Convocation Center.
“We can go 12 minutes with

anybody, but we then seem to lose

control.’ sid Pitt coach Tim'

 

Anticipating a rebound in Wednesday’s contest at South Ben are

Grgurich. Anybody, in Pitt’s last
three games, has been Villanova,
Syracuse and Notre Dame. In each
contest, Pitt has played well in the
ﬁrst 10 or 15 minutes, with a lead
often the result.

Then, as if losing their balance,
the Panthers grow wild and the
other team grows leads. Leads that
eventually reach 20 points. That’s
how a team achieves a 3-13 record.

Pitt’s problems Saturday night
were located in a semi-circle
radiating seven feet from each
basket, but especially the one at
which Pitt was shooting.

The area was easily identiﬁable—
it was the place occupied by three
Irish and no Panthers.

Pitt’s Larry Harris [25] and Fighting Irish Dave Batton [left] and Bruce

Flowers.
88-68.

The Panthers were outrebounded, 56-29, and outscored,

“Rebounding was the whole
game tonight,” Grgurich said. “We”
have one guy—Mike Rice-—re-
bounding, and he can’t do it all on
his own. The other teams’ second
and third shots are devastating.”

Many of Notre Dame’s follow
shots, particularly in the ﬁrst half,
came from 6-9 center Toby Knight,
who came up with the rebound 14
times in the ﬁrst 20 minutes and
ﬁnished with a career-high 19.
Many of his tries for the bounding
ball, however, were made easier by
the fact whichever Panther happen-
ed to be near him landed ﬁve feet
from where he jumped. Knight
provided the propulsion, usually
free of foul.

Rice, one of three freshman who
ﬁgure to make Pitt basketball
famous someday, proved once
again that he could be the most
valuable Panther for four years.
Barring a sudden awakening by

Larry Harris or Sonny Lewis, Rice

has this year’s award secured.

The 6-8 Frederick, Md., native
played the entire 40 minutes, scored
16 points, shot seven of 11 from the
ﬁeld, pulled down (and tapped up)
12 rebounds, blocked two shots and
committed only three fouls.

Harris, though hampered by foul
trouble throughout the evening,
paced Pitt with 18 points and
rebounded thrice before fouling out
near the end.

Lewis, though bothered by suspi-
cious ofﬁciating, scored 17 points
while sitting out only three minutes.
Lewis also registered one spectacu-
lar rejection, a stunning slam and
four rebounds.

Sophomore point guard Pete
Strickland of Washington, D.C.,
made his first start in a long time
and responded with 35 minutes of
sound, though not thrilling, basket-
ball while controlling the offense.
His seven assists led both teams.

Pitt traveled to South Bend with
just 11 eligible bodies, only six of
whom have played with any
regularity this season. Two,
sophomore Wayne Williams and
freshman Ed Scheuermann, were
coming off bouts with ﬂu.

They played anyway, sometimes
well. Williams scored only two
points but his defensive play
resulted in four steals. Scheuer-
mann, despite having four fouls and

Fries Freezes Duquesne  

BYJIMPANE

The Pitt Hockey Club accepted a
welcome break in its schedule
Wednesday night by devastating a
hapless Duquesne squad, 10-1, at
the Civic Arena. ‘

Sandwiched between a tough 3-2
victory over Ohio University on
Sunday and an upcoming game
against equally-tough Gannon Col-
lege tomorrow, the Panthers held
shooting practice by delivering 53
total shots on the Duquesne net,
while the overmatched Dukes could
muster a harmless 13.

It was a typical Pitt-Duquesne
hockey game with the usual
outbreak of ﬁsticuffs. Panther head
coach Len Barcalow explained the
ﬁghting as an act of frustration on
the part of the Dukes.

“They seemed to get frustra-
ted,” he said. “You could see it
buildingup as we piled up the score.

They started banging guys around
and then that led to more.

“When our guys see that, they
‘try to ward it off, but after a while
we get their number and won’t let
happen again.”

It took Pitt only 39 seconds to set
up its first scoring play, which was
started by none other than “The”
Curt Hetz, as he is sometimes
announced over the Civic Arena
public address system.

Hetz beat two Duke defenders to
a loose puck at center ice and
scooted toward Duquesne goalie
George McMillin. McMillin came
out of his crease and pounced on the
puck, but Hetz stole it away,‘ circled
behind the cage, and passed it out to
Gary Fries, who had an open net to

Gettin’ Around

Alexander The Great
Makes WVU Choice

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

Robert Alexander is already predicting Heisman Trophies and
national championships—not for the University of Pittsburgh, as was
hoped here, but for the West Virginia Mountaineers. Disgusted with
insults hurled at his state’s university, the South Charleston High School
sensation, one of the most sought-after prospects in the nation, bucked
Tennessee's Johnny Majors, Ohio State’s Woody Hayes and



Maryland’s Jerry Claiborne in electing to stay home. 

To say the least, Alexander’s choice also put a crimp in Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill’s plans of finding a running back the caliber of Tony
Dorsett (if there is such a thing) to ﬁll a gaping hole in the Panther
backﬁeld next season.‘ Alexander, who holds such credentials as it
rushing for 5,164 yards (178 yards per game) in high school and 82 4
touchdowns, also starred in scholastic basketball and baseball, leaped
6-7 in the high jump and bolted a 9.8 hundred.

Alexander signed a letter of

intent to attend WVU Tuesday,
leaving “Rooster” Jones of Biloxi,
. Mississippi, Pitt’s only other
  notable chance at replacing Dorsett.

Of course, that’s not to say there
sought,
Panthers don’t already have a few

over.
Forget for a second the golden
arm of Matt Cavanaugh ﬁlling next
season’s air with footballs aimed at
what could be the ﬁnest corps of

receivers in the nation—holdovers like ﬂanker Willie Taylor and split

end Gordon Jones. Doing this, Pitt fans hope fullback Elliott Walker,
beset by injuries in 1976, will return to the old form with which he netted

more than 900 yards two seasons ago. And what about a group of three

top freshmen from the national championship squad who saw littlet,

action only because, most likely, of the presence of Mr. Dorsett?

If the Panthers can’t grab T.D. the second from the opt at the end of 4,. c...

some rainbow, they can take satisfaction in already holding players like
Jo Jo Heath, Bob Hightower and Larry Sims——all thought very highly of
and very, very capable. Heath, from Monessen, won three letters in not
only football, but track and basketball, also, and collected such grid
honors as All-State (third team), All-WPIAL, and All-Big 10, and was a
Big 33 team member. Also a defensive back candidate, Hightower, from
Buffalo, runs the 40 in 4.5 and broke loose for 100 yards or more in nine
straight games as a high school senior, the year he was named All-State,
All-Western New York, Buffalo All-Catholic and a Prep All-America.
Sims also captured three letters in three sports—football. basketball and
track—while at West Fulton High School in ‘Atlanta. For rushing for
more than 1,000 yards, including 24 touchdowns and a nine -yard
average gain, he was designated as All-State, All-County and All-City.
So the Panthers are not hurting in the backﬁeld area, though it would
have been nice to pick up a Robert Alexander or pluck a “Rooster”
Jones. Add to the already-mentioned freshmen Fred Jacobs, who
rushed for more than 2,000 yards as a senior in high school, along with
Ray Kemp, John Falvo and Stephen Harris, it seems Pitt has much to-
chose from already.
But West Virginia has grabbed Alexander and, supposedly, his
arrogance. It seems Alexander has predicted everything but an
earthquake——including his breaking Dorsett’s career rushing

V Defensemen Larry Gallick or-
ganized the ﬁfth Pitt goal, and third
within a two-minute span, when he

pass at center ice. Hetz, who had a

into a sure All-America candidate.
. “That’s my goal—-to be an
All-American,” Bailey stated. “I
thinkl have the ability, it's just how
hard] work for it that will determine
whether or not I deserve it.”

Last season, Bailey had a chance
to fulﬁll that goal by doing well in
the nationals in sandy Tuscon,
Arizona. But a defeat in the ﬁrst

,\Q;

round turned his champagne
hopes to vinegar.

“I should have done something
last year,” he said regretfully, “I
had better do better than that this
year, or I’ll be very disappointed.”

It will be difﬁcult to do well at the
nationals, for. the superior competi-
tion and the gala of the prestigious
event make one drunk with awe.

“It’s a totally different atmos-
ohere than at regular meets,”

ailey agreed. “If you have a
tendency to crack under pressure,
you’ll crack there.”

But -V Bailey doesn’t plan on
cracking—on the contrary. the
tough competition at practice and

on Pitt’s upcoming schedule should A

turn him into a conisseur.
“I practice with Mark Stepano-

vich (heavyweight), and he's really '

tough." Bailey explained. “Any

*5’ guy like that who you face every day
' ‘makes you a better wrestler."

 

“Plus," our schedule is getting
stronger." he continued. “We play
teams like Penn State, Navy. and
Michigan. If you wrestle with the
best you wrestle like the best."

The Panthers wrestled with the
best last week at Lehigh. only to be

demolished by the ﬁfth-ranked»

‘Engineers in the second half of a
two-game. road failure.

“The loss to Lehigh (41:-3) was
really disappointing,” Bailey re-
ﬂected. “Even though they were
ranked ﬁfth, they weren’t 38 points
better than us. With all the nagging
injuries we’ve experienced (All-
American Rande Stottlemyer,
Gregg Soergel, Bruce Huggler, Ed
Bredniak and Bailey himself are
suffering from painful injuries),
we’ve had to put in replacements.
Things just didn’t go our way in that
match.”

V One reason the Pitt chablis hasn’t . .

been as delightful as ‘it potentially
could be is because of the fresh
bouquet of newcomers this season.

“We have a lot of freshmen this
year,” Bailey commented. “It’s up
to them—they have to follow
through. Only time will tell if they‘
do. I think they will.”

And the best time for these.
freshmen to shed the “inexper-
ience” label would be Saturday
night at 7:30 p.m. when the
Panthers host arch-distiller West
Virginia, a team Pitt (5-2) turned
into grape‘ jelly last year in
Morgantown, 25-11.

“We ought to repeat,” Bailey
said conﬁdently. “Hopefully we’ll
bounce back from the Lehigh match
by dominating all the way through
the meet.”

A feat that would put the Gallo
brothers out of business.

mark—-and Mountaineer Coach Frank Cignetti is probably wringing his
hands at the thought. Still, if all this talk goes to Alexander's head,
Cignetti may change his mind.

Speaking of coaches, Sherrill recently ﬁnished naming his coaching
staff for next season by landing offensiveline coach Don Boyce and
receiver coach Otto Stowe. The ﬁrst-year Panther head coach had
previously named assistant head coach and defensive coordinator
Jimmy Johnson, offensive coordinator Bob Leahy, linebacker coach
Seraﬁno “Foge” Fazio, defensive line coach Bob Matey, defensive
backﬁeld coach Larry Holton and offensive backﬁeld coach Joe Moore to
his eight-man staff. A

“The reputations of the members of my staff speak for themselves,’ ’
Sherrill said. ‘.‘I honestly feel it is now one of the best coaching staffs in
the country. I just hope we’ll be able to keep this staff intact for awhile
because I’m sure other schools will be after our coaches.”

Formerly defensive line coach at Arkansas, his alma mater, (where he
captained the 1964 national champs), Jimmy Johnson was under
consideration to replace retired coach Frank Broyles. An I All-
Southwestern Conference middle guard, Johnson, 33, coached with
Sherrill under Majors at Iowa State in 1968-69 and also tutored three
years at Oklahoma.

Returning to Pitt with Sherrill is Bob Leahy, offensive coordinator at
Washington State last season and Pitt junior varsity coach in 1975 when
the cubs went undefeated. A former third-string quarterback for the
Pittsburgh Steelers, Leahy was named Little All-America at little-known
KansasState Teachers College before turning pro.

A 1960 graduate of Pitt, ‘ ‘Foge’ ’ Fazio will also be returning home. He
started‘ at center for the Panthers in 1958-59, was named honorable
mention All-America, turned to coaching high school football instead of
playing in the pros and returned the ﬁrst time to Pitt’ in 1969-72 as
defensive coordinator under both Dave Hart and Carl Depascqua. 6 Last
season, F azio ran Cincinnati Bearcats defense that was ranked ﬁfth in
scoring defense, ninth rushing defense and 11th in total defense.

Holdovers from the Majors regime are Bob Matey and Larry Holton.
Matey guided the Pitt J V’s to a3-1 record last season before playing and .
coaching under Majors at Iowa State, where he started at defensive
tackle on the Cyclones’ 1971 Sun Bowl squad. Holton started at
defensive back for Iowa State and later coached under Majors there in
1970-71. Hepcoached at Florida State in 1972, then followed Majors to
Pitt a year later.

Don Boyce, 35, has already coachedin four bowl games with such
teams as Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Arkansas, as well as a brief

. stint with Southern Methodist.~ “Don is considered one of the ﬁnest
offensive line coaches in the country,” Sherrill commented.

And, ﬁnally, there’s Otto Stowe—member of two Super Bowl teams
with the Miami Dolphins, and a former player with Dallas‘, Denver and
Los Angeles in the National Football League. Stowe performed under
Majors at Iowa State and was named All-Big Eight wide receivers in

£1969-70, setting four a11.¢ime records for the Cyclones. The 28-year-old
mentor began his coaching career, following an injury, with Sherrill last
season at Washington State.

Is it one of the best coaching staffs in the country as Sherrill says? On
paper, maybe. But only time will tell. Rebuilding a national
championship team that will lose 41 seniors, including 11 starters, is by
far no easy task. It will take a lot of work and a lot of time.

Bolin Easel-y On Top

BY JIM LEWIS

A picture is worth a thousand
words.

So picture this—-the Pitt wrest-
ling team’s Skip Bolin crushing
opponent after opponent. ‘

It certainly doesn’t paint a pretty
scene in the minds of the Panthers’
foes, but for Pitt fans, Bolin is as
artistic a performer as Vincent Van
Gogh.

And why not? Bolin hails
from central Pennsylvania (Lock
Haven High School), the Vienna of
wrestling.

“Wrestling is a popular sport
there,” Bolin said. “Not like in
western Pennsylvania, where
people go for basketball.” 1

But, despite the lack of wrestling
buffs ﬁlling Fitzgerald Field House
seats (although “for the amount of
people at the matches, there really
is a lot of screaming, ” he admitted),
Bolin doesn’t choose to become an
antagonist toward the lack of fan
support——as a matter of fact, just

the opposite is true. One paints a
quiet, conﬁdent portrait in his mind
of Bolin upon talking to him,
“I’m pretty quiet,” he agreed. “I
let my wrestling speak for me. At

practice, I stay in the back of the A

room-—Bill Bailey (190) and Rande
Stottlemyer (134) run things. I help
individuals who may need guidance
or advice, but I don’t get up and lead
the whole team.”

That’s true; Bolin allows his
picture-perfect performances do the
talking. And what a bit of talking
they do—a 7-0 personal record and
scores‘ of 27-4, 26-3, and a
disqualiﬁcation (due to illegal
stalling tactics) under his belt.
Pretty impressive statistics, consid-
ering he suffered an. appendicitis
attack late in the 1976 season.

“It made me work a lot harder
over the summer,” Bolin stated.

The operation was a success, and
thus so is Pitt’s current showing-a
5-2 record and a dabbling in th
nation’s top twenty,‘ I

But it was only a dabbling; can
the Panthers sculpt a prominent

Dukes, Whitley Winners A

I PITTSBURGH (AP)—Norm
Nixon poured in 29 points as the
Duquesne Dukes handed the West
Virginia Mountaineers their ﬁfth
straight loss, 83-78, Thursday
night.

In the first game, 6-foot-6 Don
Mallard scored 31 points to lead the
University of South Alabama to a
77-74 victory over Robert Morris
College of Pittsburgh.

It was the third straight win for
Duquesne and both teams have 9-7

records on the season.

HOUSTON (AP)—Mammouth

defense that helped the Houston
Cougars return to national football
prominence, Thursday was named
winner of the 1977 Vince Lombardi
Award as the nation’s outstanding

power out of their starting lineup?

“It’s hard to say,” Bolin
answered. “Our goals were a lot
higher until injuries hit us. We lost
a lot of potential starters.” .,

The loss of key grapplers
(Stottlemyer, Gregg Soergel, and
Bruce Huggler, to name a few)
hasn’t mattered too much during
the top half of the season; the
oil-painting Panthers have still
beaten paint-by-numbers artist;
Akron, Buffalo, and Lycoming.

“Next month should decide how
we’ll do in the nationals and the
rankings,” Bolin explained.
“We’ve not faced top-ﬂight col}-
Ipetition at most times. But coming
up are Michigan, Clarion, Navy and
Penn State.”

In other words, the best is yet to
come, beginning with West Virginia
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in the Field
House. "

“We’ll beat West Virginia,”
Bolin assured.

Thoughts like that should be put
on canvas.

BY DAVE MCDONALD

This weekend at the Fitzgerald
Field House you may have the
chance to see men faster than
speeding bullets and a man able to
leap over buildings with a single
bound.

No, Superman isn't making his
appearance on? campus this week-
end, but 19 track teams with plenty
of talent will be competing today
and tomorrow afternoon in the 8th
annual Pitt Indoor Invitational.‘

Competing against the Panthers
will be many ﬁne eastern teams
including East Carolina, Maryland,
East Tennessee, Kent State and
Allegheny Community College.
Also returning to the Field House
are Slippery Rock, West Virginia,

Indiana University of Pennsylvania
and Pitt-Johnstown.

The Pitt Invitational will be a
battle of individuals and relays,
since there will be no team scores
kept. Included in the battles will be
a large group of track and field
standouts. . 4'

The “faster than a speeding
bullet” category contains East
Carolina’s speedsters Carter Suggs
and Larry Austin. Suggs has run
the 100-yard dash in 9.3 seconds
and the 60-yard dash in 6.0. Austin
has sped down the track in 6.1 for
the 60-yard dash.

Filling in for Superman in the
‘ ‘building-leaping’ ’ classiﬁcation is
Virginia Tech’s Keith Neff, who has

catapulted himself seventeen feet in
the pole vault.

The Panther jumpers will cer-
tainly have their hands full when
Marylands’s leapers invade the
Field House. The; Terrapins boast
6’11” high-jumper Ted Vaux from
Fox Chapel and leaper Dennis
Ivory, who has triple-jumped 50 feet
and long-jumped 25 feet.

Pitt’s Tom Herrmann also will
have a tough time protecting his
undefeated mile string with 4:02-
miler Ray Flynn of East Tennessee
and two strong milers from Kent
State—Joe Dubina (4:03) and Bill

Dunlap (4:08)—in the same race. .

Along with Herrmann, Pitt’s
undefeated corps of Eric Drescher
in the shot, Dan Schuerle in the

50-yard high hurdles and Mel Boyd
in the two-mile will have to perform

a Friday, January 28, 1977—THElPITT NEWS—Page 19

Tracksters To Don Kryptonite Cleats  

its best and more if the unbeaten
Panthers expect to hold onto their
perfect standings. Boyd’s main
competition will come from two
strong East Tennessee distance-
men, Louis Kenny (8:48 for the
two-mile) and Mark Finucane
(8:51). Boyd should be right in the
thick of things since his best
two-mile is 8:50.

Assistant track coach Dan
Sullivan, who has been working
hard setting up this meet, sees
Pitt’s chances of placing high in this
meet as strong.

“I expect to see some good
performances from the team
members this weekend for two

reasons, ’ ’ Sullivan If explained.
“One, that I have seen improve-

ment in practice and meets and two,
most of the men will be competing
in just one event, thus allowing
them to concentrate on that one
particular event. I think spectators
will especially enjoy this meet since
they can be on top of all the exciting
events in the conﬁnes of the Field
House.”

The action starts at 3:30 p.m.
today with ﬁnals in the pole vaults,
long jump, triple jump, three mile
and shot put. Trials will be held in
the 50-, 440-, 600-, 880-, and
1000-yard runs as well as in the
50-yard high hurdles.

Finals in all running events,
along with the high-jump, will start
Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Admission is
free to students with IDs, $1.00 for
adults and 50 cents for children.

Classes Are Held in
Room 519, Schenley Hall
(Student Union Building)

CLARK GABLE STILL STAR

LOS ANGELES (AP)—‘-Even in

death Clark Gable continues to loom A

larger than many present-day
movie stars.

No cult has developed, as with
Humphrey Bogart, but his fame is
'one of lingering admiration-—
almost awe and a remembrance of
the excitement he created in his
films and his life.
‘ “Clark Gable was the ultimate
ce1ebrity——more than the ultimate

‘ movie star,” said Lyn Tornabene.

“I don’t think there was a more

famous celebrity. He was the king .3;

of celebrities.”

Mrs. To/rnabene is the author of
“Long Live the King,” the %€rSt
Gable biography since tnose
published after he died of a heart

attack in 1960. She and researcher-

Meredith Brucker spent three years
on the book.
