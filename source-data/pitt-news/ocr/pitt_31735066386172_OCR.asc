Illegally

On the afternoon of Sept. 18, 1990, four bicycles

Ag were lying in the vicinity of the “No Bicycles” sign

at the Fifth Avenue entrance of the William Pitt

Union. Two bicycles were directly blocking the
ramp to the handicap entrance.

According to Sgt. Charles Grier of the campus
police, this has become a common sight on almost
every weekday in front of the union, and some
people have taken action to deter it.

“There have been many complaints to us and to
the Disabled Student Services about bicycles

gig» blocking [handicap] areas on campus,” Grier said.

Pitt student Brian Glaser said, as he chained his
own bicycle to the “No Bicycles” sign, “I do think
there is a very big problem with the amount of
space provided for bicycles on campus.”

Grier disagrees. “There are 16 designated bicycle
parking lots on campus atAllen Hall, the Cathedral
of Learning, Chemistry Building, Benedum,
Graduate School of Public Health, Hillman Library,
Forbes Quadrangle, Fine Arts Building, Litchﬁeld

about the William Pitt Union entrance, said Grier.
“[The department of public safety] had nothing to
do with the location of the bicycle lot being so

In response to the recent
Oakland rapes, sales of stun guns
have increased, according to
Mitchell Gedid of Mitchell P.
Productions. ‘

“We have sold over 300 stun
guns in the past three months,”
Gedid said.

The stun gun, operated by a
nine—volt battery, can send as
much as 68,000 volts of electricity
through an attacker’s body.
Gedid’s company markets a mini
stun gun that is 5 inches long and
2 inches wide. The gun resembles
a television remote control, but it
can easily be concealed in the
palm of one’s hand, Gedid said.
This latest mode of self protection
sounds like some device taken
from a rerun of “Star Trek.”

Although the stun gun, which
sells for $39.95, may be more
costly than tear gas, which sells
for just under $12, Gedid said the

stun gun is much more effective.

When hit, the attacker instantly
becomes paralyzed and loses all
control of bodily functions. This
gives the potential victim up to 10
minutes to get away, depending
on how long a shock was inﬂicted,
Gedid said.

“Tear gas has a delayed effect
on attackers who are intoxicated
or under the inﬂuence of drugs,”
he said. This renders it virtually
ineffective in the few seconds that
an attack can take place. A

The tear gas proves to be much
less effective because it can easily
impair its user if misprayed. When
sprayed, the gas can not be limited
in any way to just the area around
the attacker. Gedid said in four
separate instances he attempted
to use the tear gas, and in three of
the four times he was injured
temporarily.

The stun gun, which up until
about two and half years ago was
primarily used by security guards,
law-enforcement officers and

members of the military, is
activated by a button on the safety
grip that straps around the wrist.
This makes it impossible for the
attacker to turn the device around
and use it against the weapon.

Gedid said the stun gun is most
effective when applied to the
attacker’s neck, stomach or groin
area. The shock produced by the
gun has not been proven to cause
any nervous-system damage,
Gedid said.

But Walt Waters, assistant
public safety director, said that
there is a certain amount of risk
involved with both tear gas and
stun guns. Waters thinks that a
simple whistle is enough to scare
away a potential attacker.

Gedid believes that a whistle is
the most ineffective protection
device because it can easily be
thrown aside or knocked out of
the victims hand. He said that the
stun gun leaves no chance for the
attacker to strike.

effort against racism

Local groups plan

By Marietta Pacella
For T be Pitt News

Several local groups are planning to hold a festival in a united
effort to combat racism and to educate the community about
human rights.

On Saturday, Sept. 22, a Celebration for Racial Equality and
Human Rights will be held at Point State Park from noon until
dusk. ’

“There will be music, dance, children’s activities, speakers,
information booths and an Arabian clothes showing,” said Pete
Shell, representative of the Committee In Solidarity with People
of El Salvador.

The upcoming event deals not only with racism in America
but with human rights around the world.

“We are hoping to make a connection between the two," he
said.

“We expect a great turnout. It should be a good festival, and
everyone is encouraged to attend," said Shell.

Lisa Frank, representative of the Carnegie Mellon University
Women's Center, said that this event is important because it
brings together various groups such as Pitt's Campus Women's

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 20, 1990

 

Cultural interactions abound Within UCIS

By Howard Goodman
For T be Pitt News

Wet weather failed to dampen
the enthusiasm of the Asian
studies program’s students and
faculty at yesterday's Welcoming
Reception.

According to Keith Brown, the
director of the Asian studies
program at Pitt, over 100 people
were in attendance. He called the
reception “very successful.”

“Pitt [has] one of the best centers
of international studies I’ve been
at,” said Muhammad Shahid.
Originally from Bangladesh, he
has been with the University
Center for International Studies at
Pitt for nine years. He adds that
UCIS at Pitt is an example of how
mutual exchanges of terms, social
understanding and technologies
can and should be handled in the
future.

Brown said, “Asia is very
important to all of us. [Some of
the economies in Asia] are the
most rapidly developing. [Some],
are the richest countries in the
world. Their histories are also

some of the most ancient."

Brown said that the world could
benefit from studying these
countries.

The Asian studies program is
only one part of the UCIS. The
center includes the Russian and
Eastern European, Western
European, Latin American studies
programs, and many other
campus and non-campus
institutions.

Five separate programs
comprise the Asian studies
program, according to Brown.
These include the China, Japan,
South and Southeast Asia and
Pacific studies.

The director of UCIS, Burkart
Holzner, said, “The international
programs are growing with

tremendous success. Students are ’

joining for the exciting and
unusual projects.”

Diane Dakis, the reception’s
organizer, said that joining the
Asian studies program is a way of
clarifying an undergraduate’s
major. This allows the student to
network at the beginning level,
she said.

Dakis is an assistant director of
the Asianstudies programs and
an adviser to the 148 certificate
students.

Even if a major has already been
declared, a student can take ﬁve
courses (15 credits) and receive a
minor in a country. This minor
includes taking language, culture
and history courses of a country
and is called a certificate.

A graduate student may also
get a certificate, which helps
prepare students to understand
and interact with other cultures.

Dakis said she is excited by her
work “The students get us excited.
They are very motivated.” She
sees the potential for
opportunities as unlimited.

“Experiences ' create
opportunities,” said Shawn
Martin, who is gaining a certificate
through the Asian, studies
program as he attends his first
year of Graduate School for Public
International Affairs.

Faculty, undergraduate and
graduate students in attendance
at yesterday's reception shared
the opinion that mutual

exchanges of information dealing
with culture, language, lifestyle,
and business are the keys to
America's regaining of respect and
leadership in the future.

Toy Furusa came from Japan to
study what is not offered there.
Pitt is a good place to learn, he
said.

Baijianhua, originally of China,
is here as a Ph.D. candidate in
education. He said that
Pittsburgh’s people are friendlier
than most.

Christopher Winters, a
freshman Japanese major said, “I
have always been fascinated by
their culture and customs."

Pedro Baca from Nicaragua is
here at Pitt as a Humphery Fellow.
This is a scholarship which has
enabled him to study English as a
second language.

Jeremy Blaustein is a second-
year graduate student, who is a
member of the Asian studies
master's program. He stated that
he is fascinated with Asia because
it is an “antithesis of American
culture.”

By Marietta Pacella
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance continues to grow and to

mplan important events for both its

members and non—members, said
Melissa Smith, a nominee for
BiGALA president.

As of Jan. 1, what used to be
GALA became BiGALA in an
attempt to represent more than
only the interests of gays and
lesbians .The reason for this
change was that bisexuals in the

 group felt that their interests were

being neglected, explained
BiGALA member Donald Ainslie.

“There were bisexuals in the
group who thought GALA’s goals
should include their interests as
well, and they felt that those
interests should be represented
in GALA’s name,” he said.

‘‘I think the change from GALA
to BiGALA represents our
willingness to grow. It shows that
we recognize the differences
within the group as well as with
others, and [that] we are willing to
be open-minded to those
differences and to grow from
them,” he said.

Another change that has taken
place in BiGALA is the group’s

. visability. More positive attention
A and awareness is being focused

on the group this year. According
to Smith, “The climate for us is a
lot different than last year. We
have much more visibility. Many
articles have been written about
Us l8 maize [fie earripus
community more aware of
BiGALA.”

The change in. climate for
BiGALA was most apparent to

STARTS FRIDAY, SEPTEMER 21st

Smith at this year’s freshman Fair,
“Things were a lot more
comfortable for us at [this fair,l”she
said.

Since last year, the group has
also been granted their own office
on the William Pitt Union’s fifth
lloor, moving from cubicle SA to
room 502.

“We were finally given an office

due to the harrassment [Bi-Gala
recieved] in the cubicle. People
used to steal our [telephone]
receiver in the cubicle so that we
couldn’t get or make any calls.
Now we are in a closed office
space,” said Smith.
Special events are being planned
for the group this year. Socials,
debates, celebrations and a
National Coming Out Day are only
several of the groups major plans.
The group meets every other
week.

Ainsle commented that
“BiGALA’s socials are ways for
bisexuals, gays and lesbians to
get together and have a good time.
It makes it easier to meet others in
a low-pressure, , low—key
environment.”

“Socials are the fun times,” said
Smith. “There’s music, coffee, tea,
and we’ve played Win, Lose or
Draw at the socials. We meet a lot
of people we usually wouldn’t
[see] at the meetings,” she said.

According to Smith,
approximately 20 people show
up for the meetings, and
anywhere from 60 to 80 people
show up for the socials which are
ll'el'd quite flequeiltly. This year a
holiday social to celebrate all
winter festivities is in the works.

On Oct. 11, BiGALA will
become involved with National

Coming Out Day. There will be
an information table in the main
lobby of the William Pitt Union, a
speaker on the issue of “coming
out” and several other activities
as well.

“Coming out” is defined as an
individual’s public admittance to
being bisexual, gay or lesbian.
BiGALA feels that there is a great
importance in getting people to
“come out.”

“We are the silent minority.
We’re really killing ourselves by
being silent. No one knows our
issues,” said Stacy Winters, a
member of the organization. ,

On Nov. 15, BiGALA will
sponsor a public debate on
“outing.” The debate will be made
up of two people for “outing” and
two people against “outing.” The
event may take place in the
William Pitt Union ballroom
unless attendance exceeds the
ballroom’s capacity.

“We have had over 200 people

express interest in coming to the

debate. We may need a larger
place than the ballroom after all,”
said Smith.

To many BiGALA members, the
group is a necessary part of college
life.

“For me it is an extended
family,” said Winters.

“I see the group as a diverse
social/political support. More
people should take advantage of
BiGALA’s support system. It is a

really strong support system,” she 4 

said.
“I think without BiGALA I’d be

very uncomfortable. BiGALA is

my outlet. It is a place where I can
be myself and not feel restricted,”

said Smith.

According to Ainslie, bisexuals,
gays and lesbians have a difficult
time on campus due to the lack of
tolerance students have for the
differences in sexual orientation.

“It is a really hard time for
bisexuals, gays and lesbians who
live in the lon-campus]

—residences. There is a real lack of
tolerance for those people in the
community who are different, for
those people who are in the
minority,” said Ainslie.

However, BiGALA members
are making efforts to educate
students about the issues they
must face.

“We are trying to change the
environment at Pitt, and we want
to help those people who are in
the minority to find a place in
which they can feel comfortable
and secure. We want them to
know that they are not alone,”
said Smith.

Certain university departments
are making efforts to assist
BiGALA in educating the student
body.

“Some parts of the university
are supportive. Student Health
Services has provided the campus
with AIDS education, and they
listen to our concerns and views,”
said Ainslie.

“Freshman studies courses are
helping to make people more
aware,” said Smith, who will be
speaking on a panel in her
freshman studies class this week
in response to an article regarding
bisexuals, gays and lesbians in
this year’s Freshman Studies
Sourcebook.

However, Ainslie points out
that, as a whole, the university
has shown no real commitment
to their cause. .

BiGALA is open to all students
of all sexual orientations.

Smith said, “We do have

heterosexuals in BiGALA. We do
have heterosexuals come to our
meetings. We don’t discriminate
against people of any sexual
orientation.

together and to learn of the many
different issues each individual

“By working together, we can
learn about the variety of groups
that represent and speak out for
different issues as well, and we
can work toward -the one thing
we are all striving for: human
rights and racial equality
worldwide,” said Frank.

“Also, we can learn that there
are other groups out there who
deal with identical issues as well.
For example, [the CMU Women’s
Center] never knew about WREE,
and WREE never knew about the
center before we planned this
collaboration,” she said.

“Together we are showing a

hopefully, we will be able to show
these issues to the outside

“It seems that a lot of people

Winters agrees on the basic

PAT

Continued from page 1
Last January, PAT was forced to
increase fares and found that
ridership did not decline.

She said. “I think if our riders
realize our situation, they will see
the need for fare increases.”

Although the increase in diesel
fuel has brought hardships to PAT,
the possibility for a positive
outcome exists.

“There are two sides to the issue.
On one hand, the hardship is that
we are paying more for diesel
fuel. But it may be that more
people are turning to public
transportation now than they did
in the past,” said DeCourcy.

“We may see a difference in the

Christine Chergi, manager of
the William Pitt Union, suggests
more signs be posted in areas that
conﬂict with the well-being of
handicapped students.

“We are now [putting] signs on
the offending bicycles to alert
people,” said Grier.

Sabina Bilder of Disabled
Student Services said, “I wrote a
complaint over a year ago when a
student who used a motorized

[subway] or bus. I think that if the
people realize how expensive fuel
prices have become, public
transportation may be more
attractive to the general public,"
she said. ,

Julie Cardenas, a junior,
commutes by bus to Pitt’s Oakland
campus daily. She says that a
possible fare increase would not
deter her from using public
transportation.

“I don’t have any choice
because I don’t have a car,” she
said. “But I don’t think a fare
increase would have an overall
effect on ridership. Most peopl

“The sign would read to the affect

Use the shuttle so it continues its route THE Pm‘ NEWSEE

Look at the outstanding facts.
Within the last three months in the
Oakland area there have been
four reported rapes (two involv-
ing Pitt students), the Oakland
“sniper” incident, two reported
attacks by the “Ninja Guy” in
Shadyside and 73 reported burgla-
ries in Oakland involving. Pitt stu-

, dents. This might lead you to the
conclusion that the Pitt campus _

and surrounding areas are not
crime—free zones. I know you’ve
heard your [resident assistants] or
your mother or whoever tell you
to be careful, but you never really
thought much about it, or at least
I didn’t until I took a look around
me. Remember, Oakland is not
synonymous with “OK-land.”
Well, I'm here to tell you some-
thing new. You don’t have to buy
anything. or take o"ut a subscrip-
tion. It is absolutely free to Pitt
students. It is the South Oakland
shuttle service that runs seven
days a week: Sunday through
Thursday, 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Friday
and Saturday, 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. At
least for the next few weeks it will.
There is only one catch. See, you
have to use this shuttle in order for
it to stay in existence. I would like
to break in here with a bit of
bureaucratic rhetoric. In order to
continue the operation of th is serv-

ice, it is necessary to show suffi-

cient need to ensure its continued

. ﬁ4“r"zdi‘n§. Through the efforts of
the public safety department, who .

so kindly picked up the tab for this
six-week stint, the shuttle service
provides a safe alternative for
students venturing into the South
Oakland area‘.

There is one thing that seems
really strange‘-=to me, though. I
spoke with the shuttle driver last
week, and he mentioned that while
he is on his route, he stops and
offers rides to students he sees
walking alone at night. The prob-
lem is that many of these students
decline, stating that they would
rather walk alone. Remember,
this is a free service.

How many times in the three
years that I have been here have I

heard students complaining about
walking even the shortest of dis-
tances? I have even heard people
say the feel confined to their apart-
ments after dark for fear of their
own safety. I think this service is a

Letters  

step in the right direction to better

ensure the safety of the students. I
hope you will remember this when
the 20-degree winter weather
comes, and you find yourself

headed into South Oakland.

Look before you leap on Souter

I was highly impressed, nega-
tively, by the ease with which The
Pitt News subliminally slipped into
its Sept. 10, 1990, editorial “Rust
Unrelated to Roe  ,” a fabricated
fact unrelated to reality.

The first sentence of paragraph 6
to Wit:

“With the retirement of Supreme
Court Justice William [H Brennan
Ur.l, the court has now only three
staunch advocates of a woman’s
right to choose,” is a historically
accurate statement derived from
knowledge in the public domain
and based on reported legal cases
wherein the published views of
those “three staunch advocates”
are easily accessed and ascertain-
able. .

It is sentences 2 and 3 of para-
graph 6 that are highly vulnerable,
and sentence 2 advances as estab-
lished, documented fact the pecu-

liar and fanciful notion that “If

[President] Bush has his way, David
Souter will be the next justice
appointed, making five opponents
of Roe on the court.”

Actually, “Bush has" so far merely
exercised his constitutional duty
(Section 2, Clause 2) to have nomi-
nated a person,‘ one David H.
Souter, to “be the next justice,” and

only “by and with the advice and

consent of the Senate, shall [the ‘

President] appoint” (Section 2,
Clause 2) David H. Souter to “be
the next justice.” So why on this
point not accurately use the words
and phrases given to us in the
Constitution to characterize a suc-
cessful ascension of an individual
to the United States Supreme Court?
First, nomination by the president;
then, advice and consent of (or
confirmation by) the U.S. Senate;
finally, appointment by the presi-
dent.

Now, back to The Pitt News lie
concerning David H. Souter’s judi-
cial review on the knottyquestion
of abortion. I know that The Pitt
News has not interviewed David H.
Souter and has personally [ap-
praised] by him that if confirmed
by the‘Senate and appointed by the
president he would become one of
“five appointments of Roe on the
court.”

If The Pitt News has so inter-
viewed David H. Souter and has
not published the existence and
results of such an interview, then
such journalistic action would
certainly would certainly be cen-
sorship and manifestly dishonest
Also, in my judgement, it would
not be within the realm of possibil-
ity for the collective ego of ThePitt
News to fail to disclose on its pages
such an extraordinary interview
with the man who’s been, since
about July 23, 1990, busily prepar-
ing himself for his Senate conﬁr-
mation hearing scheduled to begin
on Sept. 13, 1990.

Thus, by rational deduction, I

know that your paper did not inter-

view David H. Souter up through
Sept. 10, 1990. On what basis,
then, does 7hePittNews pretend to
honestly editorialize that David H.
Souter, if and when he joins the
Supreme Court, will become one
of “five opponents of Roe on the
court?”

To materially complicate the
matter, The Pitt News goes on to
build on the quicksand of such
fabrication by claiming that “San-
dra Day O’Connor, widely consid-

ered as a swing vote before Bren-
nan’s retirement, will become a
non-dash factor in abortion cases,”
(paragraph 6, sentence 3).

For media citizen, to express an
opinion that any justice could

, “become a non-factor in abortion

cases,” and to base such opinion
on responsible analysis of reported
cases and/or interviews in the
public domain is one thing, and is
a thing to which every media citi-
zen can legitimately claim a right.

However, for a media citizen to
fabricate a fact on which to fabri-
cate a fact on which to structure an
opinion is quite another thing, and
this is exactly what The Pitt News
achieved on Sept. 10, 1990, by
ﬂatly passing off as’ a documented
fact that the ascension of David H.
Souter to the United States Su-
preme Court will result in “mak-
ing” him one of “five opponents of
Roe on the Court.” p

In foregoing respect, then, the
editorial in question is manifestly
dishonest.

If 7hePitt News does not wish to
occupy a responsible place in the

. house of capital American journal-

ism, then it had better quickly
come to grips with the realization
that such justifiable intellectual
hostility as is herein expresses in
the exposure of the foregoing lie is
all that The Pitt News can reasona-
bly look forward to from discrimi-
nating citizens. ‘

Pros and cons of Carlow living

‘I wish to respond and add to the
cover-page article and the letter‘;
concerning the dormitory situation
at Carlow College.

In Fall 1988, I was one of about

, 150 male and female Pitt students

living at Carlow. The administra-
tion housed all of the male stu-
dents in one wing in the dormitory,
and attempted to isolate us from
the rest of the residents l...l
Although Pitt offered us housing
for the winter semester, I opted to
stay at Carlow fo rthe second term,
and for my second year, mainly
because I enjoyed the advantage
of living in a small-college atmos-
phere while attending a large uni-
versity. l...l
However, on short notice, the
administration told us that male
residents, even those that attended-
Carlow, would not be permitted to
return to the dormitory next year
(now), because it decided that
Carlow is, above all, a school for
women. I feel that Carlow has
every right to go all-female. How-
ever, they are still allowing male
commuter students to attend classes
at Carlow. I suppose that the
message is “men are okay, as long
as they don’t live here”. I also feel
that Carlow has every right to deny
Pitt students housing (after all, we
do not attend classes there), but
they only deny male Pitt students
housing. This sounds like a case of
hypocrisy and reverse-sexism to
me.

Last Saturday I found myself in
front of the Federal Building in
downtown Pittsburgh observing a
peace march attended by well over
a hundred people. The march,
sponsored by the Committee In
Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador and numerous other or-
ganizations, moved from the Fed-
eral Building to the City-County
Building, where numerous speak-
ers demanded that the U.S. govern-
ment stop sending aid to El Salva-
dor’s government and the army.
State representative and former
Pittsburgh mayoral candidate Tom
Murphy spoke eloquently about
the moral imperative of establish-
ing a democracy with true respect
for human rights in the nation.

El Salvador is a tiny nation in
Central America that has one of the
sickest societies in a region known

. for vast social problems. A tiny’

landowning elite controls the
government, which has little con-
trol over a rogue military involved
in a bloody war against the Marx-
ist-Leninist group Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
Violence against Salvadoran citi-
zens is rampant, and the economy,
which in the best of times is feudal-
ist and unstable, is in a shambles.
The nation, in short, has a number
of daunting problems that practi-
cally defy resolution.

This is not to say, though, that
progress is not being made. The

nance of the army and help ex-
pand the ﬂedgling democracy that
has taken root there. ,
This entire equation, though, is
complicated by the FMLN. These
Salvadoran guerillas make up the
best trained Marxist-Leninist rebel
movement ever seen in Latin
America. The war they fight has led
to the deaths of 70,000 Salvadorans,
including 14 government officials.
Many of these have been acts of
almost unspeakable terrorism,
including the gunning down of the
innocent wife and son of a conser-
vative newspaper editor a year
ago. The FMLN has refused to de-
escalate such violence and even
launched attacks against govern-
ment targets aﬁer the beginnings
of negotiations were announced.
Which brings us back to CISPES.
According to Peter Collier and
David Horowitz, former editors of
the New Left Ramparts magazine
and authors of Destructive Genera-

   

» I  oi§p‘onunri:ry:

  
 
 

tion: Second Thoughts About the
‘605, the comrnittee was actually
founded in 1980 after the brother
of Salvadoran Communist Party
chairperson and FMLN leader Shafik
Handal yisited the United States to
establish a support committee
similar to ones that supported the
Sandanistan revolution in Nicara-
gua. The first act of this new or-
ganization was to circulate what
was called a “dissent paper” drafted
by employees of the State Depart-
ment and the National Security
Council that was even quoted by
Anthony Lewis in a New Yorle Times
article. This “dissent paper” was
later established by the FBI to be a
KGB forgery. One of their internal
documents declares their goal as
“lhavingl each escalation of the
war  bring a response more costly
than the one before, precisely the
Vietnam War phenomenon the
Administration is trying to avoid.”
CISPES raises funds and support
for the FMLN at the same time that
it opposes aid for food and medical
supplies to the government.

I presented some of the ques-
tions about CISPES raised by Col-
lier and Horowitz to lawyer Rhonda
Brownstein, official spokesperson
for CISPES’ Pittsburgh chapter.
Many of her answers had glaring
inconsistencies. She asserted that
humanitarian aid to the govern-
ment was diverted into the war
effort, but hedged when I asked if
donations by CISPES into the
humanitarian organizations spon-
sored by the FMLN were also di-

verted. She insists that the FMLN
has vast popular support in the
countryside, when in fact the State
Department insists that FMLN
guerillas employ terrorist meth-
ods to crush dissent in those areas.

Most intriguing of all, though, was I

her refusal to answer to the charges
raised by Collier and Horowitz,
dismissing both as “right-wing
fanatics.” She seemed offended
that I was asking these questions
rather than using the opportunity
to intelligently answer her critics.
Anyone who does even one
hour’s worth of research on CISPES
(as I did in Hillman Library) can
discover their deception, their
support of terrorism and their be-
lief in a Marxist ideal that has
produced repression and hard-
ship anywhere it has been tried,
including El Salvador. It bafﬂes
my mind, then, how support for
their organization can be shown
by mainstream Democratic politi-
cians like Murphy and U.S. Repre-
sentatives Ron Dellums, Mervyn
Dymally and Pat Schr" ader (who
all wrote fund—raising letters on its
behalf). The purpose of the dem-
onstration was to persuade Sen.
Arlen Specter to cut off all aid to
the country, as his is one of six
crucial swing votes. I believe we
should all ask him to reject-this
simplistic solution that would
plunge El Salvador into a twilight
from which its neighbor Nicara-

Court's rulings, accusing the court of endors-

 

 

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

There’s nothing like jumping
right out of the frying pan and
into the fire.

Last week, the Panthers faced
an almost unstoppable Oklahoma
Option-I offense which
demolished the Pitt defense,
racking up 529 total yards en
route to a 52-10 shellacking at
Owen Field.

The Sooners gained a
whopping 450 yards rushing on
60’ carries, and only 79 yards
passing in a mere seven attempts
with only two completions.

This Saturday in the Carrier
Dome, Pitt will face the Syracuse
pro-option offense, led by redshirt
freshman Marvin Graves at
quarterback. Only this time there
will be an extra factor to contend
with. q

“[The Orangemen] are a real
problem because they can throw,”

Coach Paul Hackett said. “They
can come down the line, fake the
option and drop back and [Graves]
is an accomplished passer; the
guy from Oklahoma is not.”

Graves has thrown for 586 yards
and four touchdowns while
Completing 38 of 73 passes for a
.521 completion percentage in
three games. His throwing ability
and statistics virtually mirror that
of Pitt QB Alex Van Pelt. Van Pelt
has completed 39 of 73 for 530

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Pitt's Lionel Sykes and the rest of the tight end corps are part of one
of the best TE groups in the nation, according to Dick MacPherson.

yards and two TDs while‘ posting
a .534 completion percentage in
three games.

Also, Van Pelt has been
regarded as the quintessential

drop-back passer since his
stunning debut last season. Even
when the defense is on the field
and Van Pelt is watching from
the sidelines, he may see shades

of himself last season in Graves.

Speaking of seeing oneself, the
Syracuse squad this season closely
resembles last year’s Panthers,
according to Hackett.

“I think the main difference is
their veteran offensive line
people; that’s really the strength
of their offense. They have youth
at quarterback and youth at the
perimeters, but their heart and
soul is much like our team last
year," Hackett said.

“Defensively, they’ve got some
new people up front, and they’ve
got some new linebackers, which
is where we’re young also. I
think the matchup is something I
feel pretty good about. Our
defensive line is strong; it’s young,
but it’s a pretty good matchup for
their offensive line. Their
defensive line is young, our
offensive line is young; so we’ll
just have to see,” he added.

The Orangemen start four
seniors on the offensive line, while
Pitt starts none with its defensive
front three [LE Keith Hamilton
(soph.), NT Richard Allen (jr.)
and RE Sean Gilbert (soph.)].
Syracuse starts one senior, a junior
and a redshirt freshman on its
defensive line, while Pitt goes
with three redshirt sophomores
and two redshirt juniors on its
offensive line.

An area of common ability and
strength for both teams is the
tight—end corps. While Pitt’s trio

of Eric Seaman, Lionel Sykes and”
Dave Moore provide strength in ‘

numbers, Orangemen Andrew
Dees and Chris Gedney are
equally impressive in Syracuse
Coach Dick MacPherson’s eyes.
“We, like Pittsburgh, are
extremely happy with our tight
ends. I said before that there isn’t
any ti ght-end group in the country

that’s like ours. And I told ouré.»

squad yesterday that if there’s
anybody like us, it’s the Pittsburgh
tight ‘ends.

“I wouldn’t want to say that
we’re better after watching them,
but I wouldn’t want to say that
they were better than us. It’s that
close, and I don’t think anybody
else in the country has those kind

of tight ends,” MacPherson said. t I

MacPherson is also encouraged
by the defensive talent he has at
his ﬁngertips, most notably the
linebackers. The unit includes
redshirt freshman standout Dan
Conley, who is 6—foot-2, 226
pounds and runs the 40-yard dash
in under 4.7 seconds.

The Orange secondary is the

same as it was last year in terms, » A

of personnel but is now a little
older and perhaps wiser to boot.
Given the similarities between
this season’s Orangemen and the
Panthers of a year ago, maybe all
Hackett has to do to prepare is to
dust off the old game films from
the 1989 season —- and figure out
how to play against himself. .

Senior linebacker steps out of older brother 's shadow“

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

For years, it was always, “Hey, isn’t that
Scott’s little brother?”

No matter where Craig Gob went, or
what he did, he could not shake the
comparisons to his brother, a Penn State
linebacker from 1986-89.

“It was definitely tough living in his
shadow,” said Craig, a senior inside
linebacker for the Panthers. “In fact, I
chose a different school because of that.
It’s nice to be compared to your brother,
but I’d like to be [known] by myself.”

The Gob Boys played together at Bethel
Park High School for two years. Craig saw
Scott make first team all—state honors, win
the defensive most valuable player for
Pennsylvania in the 1985 Big 33 game, and
get all the attention. ,

“One of the best things my father ever
did was take me aside and tell me to make
my own decision and to make the decision
that I was most comfortable with,” said
Craig. “As I grew older, I knew that I had
to take a different route.”

It was a move that the Panther captain
has not regretted. This year, Gob is the
Panthers’ leading tackler with 23, seven

more than runner-up Ricardo McDonald.

Against Oklahoma, Gob led the team
with 13 tackles, but in a 52-10 loss, that’s
like trying to kill a bear with a flyswatter.
It’s a nice effort, but it won’t be enough.

“A lot of things surprised us in that
game, ” said Gob. “They executed superbly,
and there were a lot of things we didn’t do
well.”

Pitt gets another crack at the option this
week when it visits Syracuse. And this
time, the Panthers will have to be on their
toes even more. Quarterback Marvin
Graves poses a double threat for the
Panthers, compared to Oklahoma, because
of his passing ability.
Graves has passed for
586 yards and four
touchdowns this year.

As a senior, as a
captain and as inside
linebacker, it’s up to
Gob to prepare the
defense.

“I expect three
things from Craig,” said
inside_-linebackers’
coach Sal Sunseri. “One,
to have total control of
the defense, second, to
be the leader of the
defense, and [third] to
be the leading tackler
on the team.”

When a team
loses 52-10, drastic
measures are sometimes
employed to shake
things up for the next
game. Not so.

“I feel that we’re

rat
Jason Hillrnan/1" he Pitt News
Craig Gob (46) has 132 career tackles so far, seven more than his brother compiled at Penn State.

a much better team than what we showed
[last] Saturday. We had such an easy game
plan to execute, but we didn’t execute as
well as we should have," Gob said.’

Showing composure, not panicking.
Those signs of maturity are evidence of
how Gob has grown as a football player
since his freshman year, according to
Sunseri.

“It’s maturity. That’s it. He got a couple
of years playing behind Jerry Olsavsky to
learn the keys of the game and understand
the scheme of things,” said Sunseri.

“When I first got here, I had to always hit
someone before I would go after a tackler.
I don’t know what it was,” Gob said. “But
Jerry taught me not to be a ﬂesh—magnet,
that it was easier to get around someone
than to have to hit them first.”

At 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds, Gob also
had to get used to hitting players a lot
bigger than himself. _

“That’s another thing Jerry taught me.
There are plenty of people bigger than
me, more talented than me, but I try to
make up for those inadequacies with
intelligence and knowledge of the game."

With that extra second and his guile,
Gob has watched his tackle statistics
increase almost exponentially since his
freshman year. In his first year, 1987, he
had 12 tackles while playing mainly special
teams. Two years ago he registered 21
tackles, and last year he added 76 more
while starting five games. His 23 this year
give him 132 for his career, already more
than the 115 his ‘brother compiled.

That may help Craig shed his image of
being Scott’s little brother, even though
he’s actually 1-1/2 inches taller than his
“big” brother.

Hassos, who also combined for
five“ saves. _

Both teams had excellent
scoring chances that were either
deflected wide by defenders, or
harmlessly rolled by the outside
goalposts.

The Panthers opened the
scoring with little more than eight
minutes to go in the first half
when freshman Ted Noethling
took a long crossing pass from
Liberati and headed the ball back
across Bachteler and into the far-
right corner of the goal.

However, West Virginia didn’t
take long, 50.-seconds to be
precise, to even the score. The
Mountaineers passed the ball
three times to set u pjohn Keating,
who beat Kapusta with a rocket
shot that was in the back of the

net before the Panther goalie
could react. .

The action slowed down for
the next few minutes, but
Noethling took a lead pass from
Panther midfielder Ivan Amayo
and broke away toward \X/VU’s
goal. He was viciously brought
down by a Mountaineer defender
just outside the penalty box, and
that merited a yellow card and a
chorus of boos from the 185
vocal fans in attendance.
However, Liberati took the direct
free kick and snuck a hard, low
shot past Bachteler, to give the
Panthers a 2-1 halftime lead.

The second half was all WVU,
after the Panthers failed to score
on a corner kick that three Pitt
players took whacks at, but were
denied twice by goalie Hassos.

Assocz'atedAr'tz'sts ofPittsburgh

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

The Associated Artists of
Pittsburgh are not confined to
subjects relating directly to the
city of Pittsburgh.

But many of the artists capture
the essence of this culturally
diverse city in works which
include “Yugoslavian Cabaret
Dancer” by Michel Tsouris and
“Eastern Europe: The Exhilaration
and Turmoil of Freedom,” by
Fonda Kurtz.

Kurtz exhibits a fascinating style
in “Encroaching Lava Burst” and
“Eastern Europe,” in which energy
and motion are produced through
the use of intricate color patterns.

The Berlin Wall is the focus of
two works by Joan C. Milsom,
“The End —— Finis” and “The
Walls Come Tumbling Down.”

“Mourning Flight,” by A. M.
Schnur, is a huge painting of two
people buried under the sheets
(presumably dreaming) in a bed
that is ﬂoating above the clouds

beside ﬂying dogs (reminiscent
of all those cats tossed by
Salvadore Dali).

James Dougherty’s “Windows
of Perception” is a psychedelic,
geometric design of lines and
boxes painted in neon colors.

The exhibit includes two
interesting works by Elaine
Wallace Morris, “Waiting for
Wings" and “Industrial
Revolution,” an unusual sculpture
that centers on early industrial
Pittsburgh.

Richard S. Golomb’s photo
“Down in the Dumpster” depicts
a discarded stuffed animal and all
of the emotional baggage that it
entails. I

Just how many of the works of _

art in this world are titled “Mask?”
There are three in the Associated
Artists exhibit alone. In one by
Charlotte Ramseyer the mask is
painted in cubes and is very
interesting.

Katherine J. McLean entered
two works from a study of motion,
a painting titled “Man Moving,

Study #1" and “R. at the gym," a
photograph in which brightly
colored streaks indicate motion.

Dorothy Forman’s “Cradle” is a
large burgundy-colored mesh
cloth wrapped around thorny
branches.

“Imbibes," by Joan Sokol, is a
dark and somewhat crude
painting of a man pouring a glass
of water on his face. By allowing
paint to drip down the canvas
and contrasting light and dark

colors, Sokol conveys the concept:

of “wet” in an intriguing way.

Other interesting works include
“What’s In Alaska” by D. A. Learn,
and “N orthward, ” by Daniel Scott
Armstrong.

“Eighty in '90" is the slogan for
this year’s exhibition. For 80 years,
the museum has exhibited a juried
show of paintings, sculptures and
photographs by members of the
Associated Artists of Pittsburgh.

The Associated Artists of
Pittsburgh exhibition will run
through Oct. 7 at The Carnegie

L7
Smell the Magic
Sub Pop

There are no push-up bras,
cute choreographed routines or
big buttons emblazoned with
these women's faces. Rather L7,
an all-girl quartet with tattoos,
green hair, and T—shirts sporting
an ecstatic woman receiving
cunnilingus, is the antithesis of
all that is contrived and cheezy in
Top 40 today.

Yet another spawn off of the
Seattle-based Subpop label, L7
delivers a tight and speedy
sampling with its recent release
of Smell the Magic.

Included in this six-song EP, is
the band’s anthem to uppity
women entitled, “Shove”, which
climbed up college charts earlier

this year. Ignorant ass—pinching
men beware, “Get out of my way
or I might shove!”

If you didn’t get the point with
“Shove,” then check out “Fast
and Frightening,” another tribute
to strong women that begins with
a ﬂurry of drums and ends with
L7’s own particular version of
siren’s wails.

With Jennifer Finch on bass,
Suzi Gardner on guitar, Dee
Plakas on drums, and Donita
Sparks on guitar, L7 isn’t out to
change the world, just
to shake it up a little bit with
raucous vocals and outrageous
lyrics.

Don’t underestimate the power
of these L.A. babes and their
ability to succeed in a “man’s
world.” In a recent interview,

Finch remarked to Kerrang
Kontaktz, “I talked to one
promoter about doing a show at
the Roxy. He said, ‘Can you doll
up for it? Put on high heels and a
nice skirt?’ I’m a rational person
but I blew my fuse! To be in a girl

‘band and successful, people think
you’ve got to be clean  Don’t
lump us into the category of girl
bands. We’re a band.”

Recent guest to the Pittsburgh
area at a W/PTS-sponsored concert

L7, sme their magic and know why these womencan rock your world.

and holding steadily in college
charts, L7 is no strangers to the
rock ‘n’ roll Bizzaro Zone.

Releasing work on such labels
as Subpop (which also gave us
Soundgarden, Tad, and
Mudhoney), Epitaph, SST, and
Cocktail Records, L7 has
developed a strong following and
with the release of Smell the
Magic, those with a more
adventurous spirit will soon be
taking these bad girls home to
meet mom and dad.

BEFORE

 

 

AFTER

At the very least, you have to
admire these women for llaunting
their tattoos (Plakas has some
nice tribal pieces) and for their
“fuck-you” attitude in a world
that perpetuates such
industrialized female artists as
Madonna and Paula Abdul, and
all the while succeeding.

——Jessica Coville

Rebby Sharp
In One Mouth Out the Other
Shimmy Disk

Rebby Sharp is a
multi—instrumentalist who led a
band in the early ’80s called the
Orthotonics and appeared on a
few albums by garage trash
rockers Half Japanese.

On her album, In One Mouth
Out the Other, Rebby shows skill
on mandolin, piano, banjo and
guitar and changes styles literally
from song to song.

“These Venitiona Eyes” is an
instrumental with some Eastern
folkish-mandolin playing. “Just

in T ime” starts out with a tranquil
piano solo sprinkled with some
“wrong” notes reminiscent of
Thelonious Monk. Then it
switches to a haunting minor
melody with Rebby singing with
back—up vocals from Kramer and
Coby Batty. It’s all rather pretty.

Some of the most unique cuts
on the album are the short pieces
where Rebby reads her poetry to
the accompaniment of a Kramer
montage.

can’t think of another band like
them that could attract a
mainstream audience and at the
same time -deserve an audience
like that.

However, the record comes as
a big disappointment because
the album’s production gives it
the big “major—label sound” and
takes away from the power of
some of the songs.

The most noticeable aspect of
this is the drum sound. It lacks
the heavy thud that was important
in earlier Dipper records.

takes away from a song like
“Monsters of Jazz,” which could
have been up there with an older
song like “You’re not Patsy” as
their more rocked up numbers.
Instead it feels like something is
missing.

“Bony Knees of Nothing” has a
horn section low in the mix of the
song. It sounds as if the band
didn’t like the horns but knew
the label wanted them there
anyway, and decided that
keeping them down was the best
compromise. As a result they
sound more out of place.

Now that I've gotten those
gripes out of the way, I can talk
more about the good elements of
the album. First and most
importantly, the songwriting on
Slam is actually more consistent
than the writing on 1988’s Craps.

The latter had nine songs, and
a good third of them seemed half
baked. The new album has 14
songs and even though the
production occasionally gets in
the way of my enjoyment, I still
like just about everything here.

After getting off to a slow start
with “Love Barge,” “The Bind”
picks things up ‘with the
characteristic Big Dipper
harmonies of guitarist Bill Goffrier
and Gary \X/aleik and a noisy
guitar solo.

This carries on into “Another

going.

GoodFellas looks at the life of a maﬁa family

By Lisa Oshop
Sta_[f Writer

Having seen the poster for Good
Fellas, Martin Scorsese’s newest
movie, I was a bit cautious about
what new ground the movie might
break. Three Italian-looking men
with a dead body sprawled
underneath them left me with the
notion that I would screen yet
another lame Maﬁa movie, and I
was on the verge of begging my
editor to allow me to view
something a bit more sublime.

But, the Showcase whip
cracked, so I entered the theater
with the burden of misleading
preconceptions. My fears were
pressed further when Henry Hill
(Ray Liotta), watches as his friends
Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy
(Robert De Niro) brutally stab to
death a man they had beaten up
and tossed in the trunk of a car.

That’s when Henry’s voice
begins the movie: “As far back as
I can remember I wanted to be a
gangster,” and I sat back and
prepared myself for another lame-
o Mafia movie.

So I was wrong. This movie
features more than overweight
mobsters holding shootouts in
restaurants —— it’s a biography of
a man whose line of work is a
little bit more dangerous,
lucrative, and illegal than the
average person. As Henry HiII’s
wife Karen puts it, “Our husbands
aren’t brain surgeons, they’re
blue-collar workers, and the only
way they figure they could make
any real extra money is to go out
and cut some corners.”

That their corner cutting
includes murder is taken for
granted and not held up for moral
evaluation. There are neither good
guys nor bad guys in this movie,
just a bunch of Brooklyn kids
trying to make it. That doesn't
mean that the characters aren’t

perversely fascinating, though.

Except for Henry, the characters
are not easy to empathize with at
all, though Scorsese makes it very
easy for us to, know his characters.
Using freeze frame, Henry’s voice
introduces each . character as
though he were the host of a
cocktail party. He tells who the
characters are and the role each
plays in his life.

A scene in a nightclub where
the camera stops on each person
and allows him to sort of say
hello as Henry says his name, is

a very engaging way of *

“introducing” the characters to
the audience It is also a biting
commentary on the silly
nicknames gangsters give
themselves and each other, both
in the movies, and—— you'll notice
if you’ve been following the
Pittsburgh drug trial — in real
life.

Henry is a strange character,
his obsession about power and
control, in all aspects of his life,
leads to his downfall. Yet
paradoxically, throughout the
whole movie his character seems
to be pure, untouched and above
the sleaziness of his life and of
those surrounding him.

He marries Karen (Lorraine
Bracco), who gratifies herself
vicariously by his power. Tommy,
jimmy and Paulie are the three
other “good fellas” with whom
Henry works, and by necessity of
their occupation, shares his life.

Tommy is ruthless, vain and
shallow, playing mind games with
his companions which is called
“busting balls.” He shoots a man
over an insult and wonders why
everyone gets so worked up about
It.

Jimmy steals everything he can
get his hands on and is satisﬁed
with this only until a bigger heist
comes along.

organization, is Henry’s mentor.
When Henry is arrested for the
first time as a teen-ager, Paulie
treats it as a rite of passage; he
and the older “wiseguys” cheer
when Henry steps out of the
courtroom.

Violence plays a big role
here.Using slow tracking, a
particularly chilling scene
showing the bodies of those who

were involved in a major deal
and how they died (with Eric
Clapton’s “Layla” in the
background) is both the goriest
scene and the best camera work
in the entire movie.

Though the camera work is
consistently awesome throughout
the movie, the acting is incredible
on all accounts (including De
Niro's, naturally), the directing

wonderful as well, the sound -

track is pretty overbearing at
times. Whoever decided that
movies are not movies without
music constantly blaring ought to
be forced to attend a convention
of cranky film critics on acid as
punishment. Despite that one
minor flaw, this movie is the best
I’ve seen of its genre, and that
includes (yikesll) T be Godfather.

The mention of a circle jerk
brings to mind all sorts of nasty
connotations: groups of men
seated in the round,’ furiously
going at their naughty bits,
pausing only momentarily to
catch a glimpse of the group
action before getting back at it.

But that’s not the image
conjured up when the legendary
Circle Jerks come up in musical
conversation. Supposedly, the
name was derived from the Latin
“Jurkist Pi,” which are Druidic
curse words from the building of
Stonehenge. l’ve got my own
theory!

The Circlejerks were, and may
still be, the epitome of satirical
punk rock. Former Black Flag

vocalist Keith Morris and former
Redd Kross guitarist Greg Hetson
teamed up to sprout the Jerks
into the Los Angeles club scene.

'While numerous members have
joined and left, Greg and Keith
have toughed it out. As of last
report, Keith Clark (drums) and
Zander Schloss (bass) have signed
on with the band.

Ten years and five albums later
the Jerks are hitting the road
again. Despite the fact that their
last album, VI, was released back
in 1987, the band has absolutely
no label support. I guess they
must have gotten the itch.

The band’s first two albums,
Group Sex and Golden Shower of
Hits, set the precedent for the
jerks’ hilarious mumbo—jumbo
of social revolt. Wonderful
followed soon after on Combat

Records.

Probably the biggest breaks"

for the Circle Jerks came with
their inclusion on the
rockumentary Decline of the
Western Civilization and the now
cult classic Repoman, in which
Schloss held a leading role, and
thejerks performed a live acoustic
version of “When the Shit Hits
the Fan.”

Decline was the United States’
first documented look at the
burgeoning punk scene on the
West Coast. It may have been a
bit melodramatic, but it proved
to be funny as hell, and it certainly
gave Middle America something
to ponder.

The Circle jerles will be
performing an all-ages show at
Grafﬁti on Sept. 25. with special
guest The Weirdos.

Asst. Managing Editor

There’s a lot that Mike Sula likes;
natural blondes, blue Long Island iced
teas and The Butthole Surfers. But when
it comes to his job as Promotions Director
at WPTS, he sometimes has to encounter
the cheeziness of the professional music
world.

“I’m in a position where people want
something from me. I don’t like having
my asskissed, really. I like to do things
because I want to do them and because
I want to promote people I respect and
music I like.

“A few concert promoters are in it for
the money, but then there are also a
good number of promoters who do it for
the music and for the scene. I respect
those people. T here’s a lot of people in
Pittsburgh whoselhearts are in it,” he

said.
However, working at Pitt's college
station allows Sula work with upcoming

and unusual artists. Recently New York’

City's Cop Shoot Cop came to town for
a WPTS concert bash. “They stayed with
us for two days before going on to

Philadelphia to play. We went to the
basements of David Lawrence and looked
at a gorilla that was about to be dissected."
It was rotting and had maggots on it, and
they were really into that.

“Then we saw literally a barrel of
monkeys;_a 40- gallon drum filled with
monkey carcasses. After that, they were

going to Centralia, Pa., which has an
underground coal fire. It was a lot of
fun,” said Sula.

The Cop Shoot Cop extravaganza also
included the likes of L7, HOG and
Northern Bushmen.

“We got a lot more people than I

expected, which renewed faith in my
heart that people have brains and are
willing to experiment with bands that
don’t sound like everyone else,” said
Sula.

« In the future Sula would, “like to bring
in King Missle again. I’d really like to
bring Nick Cave, but that’s a lot of

money, and it might not happen.”

What’s in WPT S for Sula? “I get to see
a lot of shows and the money's nice. I
also get to talk to bands that I like and
respect.

“We should be taking every advantage
of this four-year experience on college
radio that we can, because if we were
stupid enough to go into professional
radio we’d never get to be doing what
we’re doing now,” he said.

The difference for Sula is that, “Right
now we play the music we want, we
promote the bands we want, and we do
things in a way that isn’t structured; so
we can still have fun. It’s not like a job,
it’s a good time,” he said.

As for WPTS’s purpose as an alternative
station Sula believes, “We’re here to
expose people to things that they
wouldn’t have access to otherwise. In
that way I think we provide a service to
our student body.”

Sula wants “to avoid the real world for
as long as possible,” but if he had to
choose, “I guess it’s everyone’s dream to
be a rock ‘n’ roll star.”

Soundings

Continued from page 6 _ "*1
quartet~is right on target with

some of the other tunes. The
quick and catchy “Allison” is
indeed a credit to the band's
capability and the dreamy “Ana”
serves as one of the albums most
compelling moments.

But basically, the problem with
Bossanova is that too much of it
is Simply forgettable. It’s just no.5
an album that can be relished
and appreciated by those who
have been spoiled rotten by such

alternative treats as Doolittle and ~

Surfer Rosa.

Some say that Black Francis
penned the album’s 14 songs
while drifting around the country
in his rust—spotted car; it's too bad
that he didn’t drive just a little bit

farther. "’
