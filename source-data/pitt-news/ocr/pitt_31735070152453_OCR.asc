Pitt’s graduate religious studies program
is dead. Meanwhile, two other graduate
programs are awaiting their sentence on
death row. .

The three programs are not resting
peacefully, though, and University faculty

and administrators are still exchanging -

ﬁnal words.
On Jan. 30, Provost Patricia Beeson

. accepted proposals to eliminate the re- _
ligious studies program and continue the
suspension of admissions to Pitt’s gradu-

ate programs for German and classics.
The Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences
suspended admissions to the three pro-
grams in April 2012.

The move stems from a dismal show 
of state funding for the University, which
3 according to Beeson’s public statement is

at its lowest since the University became

§:state—related in 1967.

A In herjan. 30 statement, Beeson quot-
ed the Dietrich School’s strategic planning
document dated March 30, 2012, which

‘said “neither an across the board budget

reallocation by department, nor an across
the board reallocation by mission, could
be implemented without damage to our
programs?’ She added that the-Dietrich

' School prioritized programs that have

“the best opportunity to have.a major
national orinternat-ional impact.”
Beesonsaidthe Dietrich School, along
with’ the Graduate Council and Arts_and
Sciences Council, evaluated the programs

leased upon qua1ity,.impactan<1 Cristi. >
 good stewards of the“resou"rces7
entrusted to us, we are responsible for

"continuously evaluating the eﬂjciency
and effectiveness of our programs,” Bee-
son said.

There are currently 11 students —
nine in.their dissertation stage —- in
the religious studies graduate program.
There are seven students in the German
graduate program and four students in
the classics graduate program, according

 toivthe departr°nent’s websi"té, wm§r“a’was
lastupdated °n;N°V~ 
' According to Pitt’s chemistry depart-
Irnént website,7the‘gra’duate p»rogr§ﬁi"has»
almost 200 graduate students. As stated
on their individual websites, the econom-
ics department has roughly 50 graduate
students and the math department has
roughly 80. -
The chairs of the three departments

— terminated or suspended — aren’t _

satisﬁed with the University’s decision
or how it was made‘.
The chairs claim the University rushed

with a lack oftfansparency and detailed,
public budgeg information.»

_ "Pitt’s chapter of the AAUP released T
a. letter to.Provost Beeson on May;1‘0,-_ '.

2012, that said the initial suspensions
of the programs the previous month
“were made prematurely and without
adequate consultation” with the chairs
or the school’s governingcommittees.
Pitt Vice Chancellor of Communica-
tions Ken Service saidthe University does
not have any additional comment beyond
what is included in Beeson’s letter when
asked by The Pitt News to respond to the

“The general gist of it all was thatlyour

studentsin your graduate programs in

classics, German and religiouslstudies do

not measure ups to other departments.”

 

the process silenced their concerns and
left them in the dark with the sudden an—_
nouncement in April 2012, just days'be-
fore the ﬁnal graduate candidates would
accept invitations to the University.
Graduate students must accept offers’
from programs in April. The chairs said
the timing and lack of prior notice inten-
siﬁed their end— of—year duties and turned
away fellowship—winni-ng applicants.
Cbntending sides
A mixture of opinions surround the
decision.‘ ‘ V l
' Beverly Ann Gaddy, president of Pitt’s
chapter of the American Association of
University Professors, said the group be—
lieves the University did not meet AAUP’s
standards for shared governance between
administration and faculty. The AAUP

is an organization that promotes aca- 5-

demic freedom, shared governance and
economic security in Higher education.
Gaddy said the process was fraught

chairs’ allegations about the process and
statements on how the decision will affect
undergraduate education. The University
also had no further comment when asked
why the University chose these three de-
partments, how the statistics in the plan-
ning document were collected, what the
total amount of reallocated funding per
ﬁscal year resulting from the eliminations

_ and suspensions would be and where the

reallocated money will go. l
Others, however, said the University
handled the situation appropriately.
The University Senate Budget Policies
Committee is a subdivision of the Fac-
ulty Senate that reviews whether a school

adheres to its bylaws and guidelines re— ,

garding planning and budget processes.
The committee examined the proposal
processes in the case of the German, clas-
sics and religious studies programs for

 any wrongdoings.

; .,The Senate Budget Policies Committee

 uts against  /_  graduate programs

released akrepo'rt‘on Oct. 18‘, 2013, that
supported the-DietrichcSchool’s decision

to suspend and terminate the programs.

a The reportstated that “thelack of
prior consultation was counter to the
spirit of the Planning and Budget Sys-
tem,” but the Dietrich School deans did
not violate University guidelines because
they initially temporarily suspended, not
terminated or modiﬁed, the programs.

A tumultuous pronunciation

The process began when Dietrich
School of Arts and Sciences Dean N.]ohn
Cooper called then-department chairs —
John Lyon fromGerman, Linda Penkower
from religious studies and Edwin Floyd
from classics — into -his oﬂice on April
2, 2012, to alert them of the potential
suspension.

Lyon said the chairs did not know why
the meeting was called.

“We found out that morning when we
were given part of the planning document
that said [the University] is reallocating
funds to bring up Pitt in the [national]
rankings,” Lyon said. _

' Floyd,.who served as interim chair
while classics department chair D. Mark
Possanza was on sabbatical, said the plan-
ning document had a list of “bad fea-
tures,” or reasons for the decision, such
as the programs’ number of students and
the time it takes to complete a degree.

“The general gist of it all was that your
students in your graduate programs in
classics, German and religious studies do
not measure up to other departments,”
Floyd said. '

When asked for his thoughts on the
circumstances and ‘for his response to
the chairs’ statements, Coopersaid he is
not taking media requests and directed
questions to the Dietrich School.Spokes—
woman Carol Mullen.

Mullen said Cooper supports the
provost’s decision, but has no further
comment.

Cable providers have always seemed

to arbiuarily raise their costs at the.

  Pitt receives No. 9 seed in tournament's South region

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers were just sitting down
to eat dinner when they were the fourth
team announced as a participant in the
NCAA Tournament. When CBS anchor
Greg Gumbel informed the nation Pitt
would be a No. 9 seed facing No. 8 seed
Colorado Thursday in Orlando, Fla., play-
ers, as Lamar Patterson said, “Didn’t even
see it.” v _

“I sat down and next thingl knew they
said we were playing Colorado,” Patterson
said. “Usually We’re sitting in the chairs
and all that, but this year it happened so
fast.”

Pitt (25-9, 11-7 ACC) was announced
earlier than usual because of its assign-
ment to the South region of the bracket’s
ﬁeld of 68 teams, the region ﬁrst an-
nounced on the broadcast.

“It came kind of early,” guard James
Robinson said. “We were all kind of just
like sitting around. We’re happy with it,

COLUMN

Dan Sostek
Stajj” Wrz'ter

Pitt fans did not have to wait long into CBS’
Sunday-nightbroadcastto learn the Panthers’
seed inthe NCAA Tournament, and the result
wasn’t much of a shock.

Five minutes into the show, itwas revealed
that Pitt would be a No. 9 seed in the South
Region. The No. 8-seeded Colorado Buffa-
loes await the Panthers in the second round

of the NCAA Tournament this Thursday in - l

Orlando, Fla.

The winner of the matchup willtake on the
tournaments No. 1 overall seed, the Florida
Gators. '

‘The seeding shouldn’t have come as a sur-
prise to many. ESPN’s bracketology expertjoe
Lunardi had the Panthers slated as the ninth
seed in Arizona’s bracket in his ﬁnal projec-
tions, and the consensus of other forecasts
had Pitt either slated as a No. 9 or 10 seed,
aswell. _ .

While a No. 9 slot was expected, there

we’ll be ready to go.”

The Panthers are now on the other side
of the coin they were on last year, as a No.
8 seed matched up with No. 9 Wichita State

- in the second round. The Shockers upset

Pitt en route to a Final Four appearance.

Head coachjamie Dixon is aware of the‘

Panthers’ position entering the contest.
“They’re an eight, We’re a nine, so we’re
the underdog going in,” "Dixon said. “We’ve
got to go in and play good basketball.”
Redshirt senior center Talib Zanna
will participate in his fourth NCAA Tour-
nament and said that “some people care

' about the seed,” but he is not one of them.

“I think the seed doesn’t matter be-
cause a couple years back, a lot of [Pitt]
teams had a No. 1 seed and in the ﬁrst
round they went down, so I think the seed
doesn’t matter,” Zanna said. “It’s who has
the heart to come ‘out and dominate and
play like they want it so bad, so that’s the
people who’s [sic] going to win the tour-
nament.”

Like the Panthers, the Buffaloes are

r

. missing one of their best players because

of injury. Leading scorer Spencer Dinwid-
die was lost for the seasonjan. 12 when he
tore his ACL. ~
‘ The day before Dinwiddie sustained his
injury, Pitt’s third-leading scorer, Durand
Johnson, suffered the same injury in Pitt’s
win against Wake Forest. _
The fact Colorado (23-11, 10-8 Paciﬁc
12) lost its best player was all Zanna said
he knew about the Buffaloes. Patterson
had positive words abouthis competition,

‘despite limited knowledge. 4

' “I know they shoot the ball well, they’re
a good team,” Patterson said.._“They re-
bound well.”

» If the Panthers manage an upset of

Colorado, they’d face the tournament’s No._

1 overall seed Florida Gators in a virtual
home game for the Gators at the Amway
Center, just hours away from their main
campus in Gainesville, Fla. y

“We can’t do nothing about it,” Zanna
said. “We just have to come together and
just play the way we play.”

  

Pitt’s seed was up in the air before to the
ACC Tournament, but a win against No. 15
North Carolina locked the Panthers into
the Big Dance. It also might have pulled
the Panthers up from being a No. 10‘seed,
which many bracketologists projected
them to be last week. -

_ Dixon doesn’t know whether or not the
selection committee gave his squad the
right seed, saying “it is whatitlis.”

"I think they may miss you by one slot
or they mayhave to move you around be-
cause of conferences or locations,” Dixon
said. “I don’t think there’s a big debate
about being one or-the other, eight or
nine, or nine or ten. You’re going to play
somebody good.” ‘ I

Whether that somebody is Colorado
Thursday or Florida Saturday, Patterson
and the Panthers are focused on the task
ahead of them, as their next loss will end
their season.

“We know we have to play somebody,
so we just gotta go out and play now,” Pat-
terson said. i A

Panthers seeded ninth because of lack ofquality wins

were points in the season in which Pitt was
projected for. both a higher and lower seed.
There are reasons why they sit where they
are, aswellas arguments forbothahigher and
lower seed for the Panthers in the Round of 64.
The Case for a Higher Seed

. Pitt’s basketball program has -had its
share of close losses in recent memory, and it
seemed that2013-2014 added atrove of other
examples to the already extensive catalog of

 I . heartbreak. A loss atthe buzzer to the rival

Syracuse Orange through a miracle heave by
Tyler Ennis at the Petersen Events Center, as
well as losses at Syracuse, Virginia (twice),
North Carolina_and Cincinnati that were de-
cided in the ﬁnal minute of each game, are
the lasting images from Pitt’s season thus far.

Of course, these defeats counted as losses

in the standings, but an argument could be .

made that these losses actually exhibited that
Pittwas teeteringjust around the level of tl1ese

Seniors ﬁnd common goal While

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

The scenes of Talib Zanna and Lamar Pat-
terson training to become college basket-
ball players seem like they were pulled
straight from a movie — like basketball’s
rendition of Rocky Balboa pummeling
away in a meat freezer.

Zanna’s cross-continent voyage to
Pitt was cultivated while he was carving
through the winding mountains outside
Kaduna, Nigeria. He was just a wire-thin
kid, trying to shape a gifted, malleable
frame into an athlete’s body.

Lamar Patterson wasn’t darting
around a mountainous landscape, but
he still had a moment of pause. With his
chest heaving between panting breaths,
Patterson sat on the sidelines of the
basketball court at St. Benedict’s Prep, a
boarding high school in Newjersey with
one of the most vaunted hoops programs
in the country. As a senior in his ﬁrst year
at the school, he was competing with the

best players his age —— a choice he made
when he transferred from].P. McCaskey
High School in Lancaster, Pa. —— but by
no means wasvhe keeping up with them. V

The Nigerian strived for more reﬁne- A
ment in his skills, enrolling at a camp in
Lagos that was run by a former George-
town player. The American couldn’t keep
ducking the intermittent breathers while _
his equally precocious teammates proved
their superior conditioning.

Patterson and Zanna each had what
the other needed to complete theirgames. '
After ﬁve years and a collective 275 games
with Pitt’s program, they’ve taken bits and
pieces from each other. But the give-and-
take relationship is drawing to a close.

There is no guarantee of either play-
ing in the NBA. For now, the players are
working to extend the expiring clock on
their collegiate careers.

Raw TalentThere are conﬂicting re-
ports about Zanna’s training regiment.

The team’s media guide says he “ran
up and down mountains to help increase
his strength and speed.”

Godwin Owinje, a former player at

about the claim.

to become bigger, faster and stronger. ‘

When Owinje, who lived in Kaduna _

when he was young, ﬁrst saw Zanna at
the big man camps for basketball play-
ers that he runs throughout Nigeria, not
much stood out. He looked like any other
kid his age, hardly taller than most-. Then‘
Owinje remembered something.‘

“Talib was very skinny,” he said. “He’s
probably twice his size now because. he
was really skinny.” '

So imagine how much lankier he
looked once he hit agrowth spurt at

about 13, “when he started leaving ev-
erybody behind with height,” as Owinje
described it. y

Until that point, Zanna was just as
interested —-— if not more -—- in soccer,
the most popular sport in Nigeria. Ow-
inje said that basketball, while growing
in participation and widely accessible
in Kaduna, doesn’t even come close to

garnering the fanfare that soccer does.

“Everybody in Nigeria plays soccer.
Then you grow too tall and somebody
will say, ‘Hey, why don’t you golplay bas-
ketball?’” he added, laughing perhaps at
the simplicity or reality of his statement
— probably both. ‘

Zanna’s older brother suggested he

try it out because he could have a bright
future in the sport, so Talib plugged away
at learning the game. He worked with

Owinje and together they attended other .

camps across Africa. But the mentor was

' traveling back and forth between con-

tinents, his home in Maryland and his
camps in Nigeria. The student stayed
focused on a newfound dream.

“At the early stage, he was just hun-v

gry,” Owinje said. “When he was 9, 10
[years old], every time I’d go back and run

camps, he’s always had that dream of, ‘I ‘

want to go play basketball in the States.’

He told me that, but .I‘was like, ‘You’re‘

not ready, you gotta continue to work.”’

i A Owinje said that kids in Africa “would _ i
kill to have a chance to come play basket-

ball in the States.” ' " , T
“‘If I work hard,’ they say, ‘that right

. there will take me to the United States,”’

he said.

Soowinje would tell Zanna to work,

Panthers prove‘ NCAA Tournament worthiness in Greensboro

0 Nate Barnes
Sports Edz'zfo'r

The Pitt Panthers arrived in Greens-
boro, N.C., without certainty that their
game(s) played in the ACC Tournament
would be the last meaningful ones of the _
season. In Pitt’s first year participating
in the 61-year-old event, the Panthers
knocked off two teams local to the area
and secured their bid to this weekend’s
NCAA Tournament. i

As a team on the bubble of participat-
ing in March Madness the next weekend,
the Panthers wanted to show their worth
with one last chance to convince the
Selection Committee for a bid to the
NCAA Tournament. ' '

“We just wanted to make a statement
to all the people who doubted us,” cen-
ter Talib Zanna said. “We can make it
to the NCAA Tournament, we can beat
ranked teams.’7 _

After a first-round bye, Pitt came out
and hit head coach Jeff Bzdelik’s Wake

' H March 17,‘ 2014 | The Pitt News I v\A/vvv.piiirievvs.com

* Forest Demon Deacons in the mouth

with a 29-point victory Thursday after-
noon at the Greensboro Coliseum. On
Friday, the ﬁfth-seeded Panthers upset

the fourth—seeded North Carolina Tar ‘

Heels —— a program deeply ingrained
in the illustrious fabric of ACC history.

But ACC regular-season champion
Virginia sent the Panthers back to
Pittsburgh with a three-point win in
the semiﬁnals Saturday. I

Pitt (25--9) made its statement,
though, and secured a bid to its 12th
NCAA Tournament in the last 13 years.
No player embodied that achievement
more so than Zanna, who averaged 17
points and 13 rebounds in his three
games at the conference tournament.

In the win against No. 15 North Caro-
lina, the Panthers.finally got their vic-
tory over a ranked team after coming
so close against the Tar Heels, Virginia
and Syracuse twice during the regular
season. The inability to win those games
against tough competition was yet an-

other factor driving Zanna’s play over
the weekend.

“We made a statement today,” Zanna
said Friday. “We take that as a motiva-
tion just to show people what we can do.”

Even head coach Jamie Dixon, who
is normally nonplussed by the regalia
of any opponent, gave a little credence
to the importance of defeating the Tar
Heels. ’ ' _

“When you beat North‘ Carolina
in North Carolina, there’s just, from
the messages I got from people in the
league, there’s something to it,” Dixon
said. “I guess it doesn’t happen often,
so that’s'something.” ’

At the same measure, Dixon says, “In
no way are we satisﬁedwith getting to
the semifinals.”

“We knew to get to the champion-
ship you’re going to.have to beat quality
teams, and we beat two quality teams,”
Dixon said. “But we didn’t get it done
against the third.” '

A major factor in Pitt’s run to becom-

ing one of the league’s ﬁnal four teams
playing in Greensboro-was the health
of Zanna and redshirt senior forward
Lamar Patterson, who respectively dealt
with an ankle and hand injury late in
the season.

A healthy Zanna was most notice-
able, as he decimated North Carolina’s
frontcourt to the tune of 19 points and
21 rebounds before fouling out after 34
minutes of play. Patterson also scored 17
points per game, and his shot showed a
healthier stroke as he shot 46.1 percent
from the field and knocked down 54.5
percent of his attempts from 3-point
range. _

“Everyone is healthy, everyone is
ready to go,” Patterson said after scor-
ing 24’points on Thursday. “We’re dialed
in. Today was just a sign of that.”

Dixon concurred at the end of the
tournament.

One thing Dixon became aware of

all-important second part seemed endless.

But traditionally, just how big of a role
has Pitt’s form coming out of its confer-
ence tournament had on its performance
in the second half of the month?

Results show a pretty signiﬁcant one.

Both of the Panthers’ ﬁrst-round NCAA
Tournament exits since head coachjamie
Dixon took over as head coach in 2003-
2004  last season against Wichita State

‘ and against University of the Paciﬁc in

2005 — came after they lost the ﬁrst game

Second-round losses to Xavier in 2010

and Butler in 2011 were foreshadowed by.

the same result. 7 »

T .. All four defeats came at the quarteniinal

stage, following double byes past theiﬁrst

‘ received by virtue of its top—four ﬁnishes

in the regular.-season Big East svtandifri-gs.
" The ACC’s adoption of the doubleﬁbye

i meant the squad skipped just one day of

competition in North Carolina as the No.
5 seed and started its conference tourna-
ment campaign on a Thursday after play-
ing the previous Saturday.

The Panthers walked over No. 12—seed
Wake Forest in the opener with a 29-point
victory and generated momentum in do-

ing so, something they haven’t done often .
 in 2014.

Redshirt senior Lamar Patterson spoke
of carrying over that elusive momentum
to the matchup with No. 4 seed North
Carolina the next day, which the team did.

In achieving back—to—back victories,
Pitt avoided What has become a death knell
for its March Madness aspirations.

That performance did not align with‘

‘ recent results. Going into the ACC Tourna-

ment, the team had lost two home games
to schools not headed to the N CAAS and
needed overtime to beat another on the
road. ’

games or more ended two months ago

The ‘rising energy levels are evident
at the individual level, too, with players
using the games as springboards to what
they hope will be repeat performances
a few days from now, as redshirt senior
center Talib Zanna did. He used the three
games in three days to eclipse his normal
output this season and garner an ACC All-

averaging 17 points and 15 rebounds,
markedly higher than his regu1ar—season

Freshmen grow into contributory roles throughout season

Jamie Dixon, like any other coach, would pre-
fer a playerto have experience. And like most
coaches, Dixon has often had the luxury of
mostly depending on upperclassmen.

Typically, Dixon has received commit-
ments from recruits who stay at Pitt for four
or ﬁve years and has reaped beneﬁts. A

After Pitt’s second—round defeat to Wichita
State last year, it looked like Dixon would once
again be able to depend an experienced play-

‘ ers. ~

But the roster soon endured some unex-
pected losses.’ ‘ . i ,

' Guard Trey Zeiglerwas the ﬁrstto go when
he transferred to Texas Christian University.
Zeigler wasn’t a‘ huge loss from a contribu-
tion standpoint, but his departure still hurt
Pitt’s depth. d .

Soon after, Pitt experienced a crushing
blow. V . '

Despite claims that he would retum to the
University alter Pitt’s loss in Salt Lake City,

0 .

center Steven Adams decided to enter the
NBA Draft. The loss left Pitt without its key
defensive cog and no true center on the roster.

Last of all, forward 1.]. ‘Moore decided to g -

transfer to Rutgers. Not only did Pitt lose one
of its best scorers in Moore, but it alsoleft Pitt
with limited forward depth. ~ .
When ateam endures losses so late, it has
to .— oﬁenunsuccessfully — scramble for
replacements. Dixon and his staff quickly got
to. it, searching for alternatives.

most recruits are already committed by the

spring and theamount oftransferswhp could _

aged to restore a little depth on his frontline, I

forwardJamelArtis and bringing Derrick Ran-
dall into the fold as a transfer from Rutgers
following the Mike Rice debacle.

, Atthe beginning ofthe 2013-2014 season,
maybe more so than ever in his career, Dixon

i had to depend on freshmen heavily. Freshmen

Michael Young and Artis marmed the power
forward spot, whilejosh Newkirk took all of

the backup point-guard minutes and some
more as the backup shooting guard.

The ﬁxture results seemed grim.

When teams depend on freshmen, it’s usu-
ally by choice because they provide a better
option over the alternative. Young, Artis and
Newkirk, however, were forced into these

., roles out of necessity, despite deﬁciencies that

would seemingly leave them underqualiﬁed.

Fast forward to the season’s end: Dixon’s A

‘freshmen dramatically improved. Not only
that, but all have ﬁlled their roles wellenough
that their success could play a role in how
far the ‘Panthers can advance in the NCAA

" Once Adams decided to enter the NBA

To go along with that, Young has a shoot-

ter competition, Young proved not to be up
to the task.

In his ﬁrst 10 ACC games, Young shot a
mere 19—for-46 while looking terribly un-
comfortable on the offensive end. Alongwith
poor results, Young’s conﬁdence was clearly
shaken as fans witnessed the player sulking
on the court after missed shots.

As the season progressed, however, Young V

improved. ' °
Even though he’s still not the most com-

fortable ﬁnisher around the rim, Young has V

been able to make high-percentage shots
easier and make them look easier, too. Young’s
last ﬁve regular-season ACC games are a tes-
tament to his improvement, as he averaged

' 8.2 points a game, up from his 6.1 average

on the season.
Mainly, Young has made his greatest con-
tributions through defense and rebounding.

i when Zanna isn’t grabbing a clutch rebound _

or makinga playon the defensive interior, it’s

usually Young., .
The developments have surely pleased
Dixon.

 “Coach, for the most part, he just wants
us_to go out there and focus on playing de-
fense and rebounding, so that is whatwe do,”
Young said. i

I  conﬁdence has improved, too.

 No longer sulking, Young has assumed a
more relaxed mindset, disallowing himself
from stressing over. too much over a missed
shot. That mentality has allowed him to grow
more comfortable in the college game and to

face-up jumper, post-up move or knock down
a 3—pointer when the defense gives it to him.

When Artis ﬁrst showcased his skills in
the Greentree Summer League, it was clear
that he simply had the look of a Pitt player.
Strong, skilled and tough as nails, he resem-

bled predecessors such as Sam Young and '

Brad Wanamaker.

But also like his predecessors, he looked
like he would have to endure a few obstacles
along the way. _ A —

His variety of skills were evident, but it
didn’t seem like he’d be able to .put them all
to action. And like many freshmen, Artis had
to work on his body.

sporting too much bad weight. Artis recog_—'

Everyone is telling the same story.

The Panthers haven’t had a bad loss all
season. They’ve won a combined 11 games
on the road and at neutral sites and have lost
only three. ~ V ,

They might evenbe playingtheirbest bas-
ketball of the season, especially considering
the fact that ﬁfth—year senior leaders Lamar
Patterson and Talib Zanna are ﬁilly healthy
after weeks of battling injuries that slowed
the individuals as well as the team.

Allthose things are true, butthe umbers
don’t lie.

Com'e Thursday, when the Panthers begin
a journey that th y hope will lead them to
North Texas at the Final Four, none of that
matters.

Instead of opining when exactly the Pan-
thersw1llex1tthisyear’s BigDance, or praising
head coachjamie Dixon for bringing his team
back to the tournamentfor the eighth time in
nine years — one of only three teams that can

say that — consider the ﬁgures that follow.
Using statistics from each conference
game, including the ACC Tournament, these
numbers should not be mistaken for my sug-
gestions on how Pitt can win games. Instead,
they should serve as benchmarks the team
must reach, which will give us a good read as
to whether or not the Panthers are playing
well enough to win games and potentially
make a run in this year’s NCAA Tournament.
, In every Pitt loss since conference play be-
gan, the opposing team has ﬁnished the game
shooting at least 40 percent from the ﬁeld.

. Dixon uses the opposing team’s ﬁeld goal
percentage as a benchmark in almost very
p°ostgame press conference. E

And he does so with very good reason.

In Pitt’s eight losses in conference play
this season, the opponent has recorded the
following shooting percentages:

Defensive ‘efﬁciency will be key for Pitt,
and Dixon said there are a number of things
that contribute to keeping that numberd wn.

‘ “We didn’t hold them (Virginia) and with
that you don’t get as many transition opportu-
nities and you don’t get the rebound numbers
we want to get,” Dixon said. “We did not get
the stops that we needed to get at the end of
the game. It was guarding penetration that

.was a big problem, I was surprised they beat
us off the dribble as much as they did.”
“When we got stops at their end, it was
guarding penetration and keeping them in
front, making them take tough shots. That is
what we have got to do.” '

 

In Pitt’s 13 wins since conference play be— I

gan Jan 4., their opponent has managed to

_ shoot higher than 40 percent from the ﬁeld
only ﬁve times.

' g If Pitt is goingto grind teams out in similar

fashion to Virginia, the Panthers have to do

all the grunt work to make their opponent I

ﬁght for a basket.

In every loss since conference play began,
Pitt’s number of free-throw misses is greater
than or equal to the margin of defeat.

This stat is a little bit tougher to decipher,
but it says one thing: Pitt needs to improve at
the foul line.

Here is the proof:

The list goes on.

“We don’t step up to the line thinking we
are going to miss our free throws,” junior
guard Cameron Wright said. “We deﬁnitely
will be working on our free throws this week

things that count.” _ «
Free throws are free throws. You can al-.
ways look back at them and ask, “What if?”

and just have to understand that it is the little » I

But,‘to a certain extent, you have to expect
better from Pitt. The Panthers must take ad-
vantage of these free opportunities in order
to win close games. '

In every Pitt victory, the team had at least
three players in double ﬁgures and on ﬁve oc-
casions, four players have ﬁnished the game
with at least 10 points.

Pattersonwill score his points, and usually
Zarma reaches double ﬁgures, too. But it is up
to the secondary scorers to’ get Pitt over the
hump. The trio of freshman —— Mike Young,
Jamel Artis and Josh Newkirk — have each
played a signiﬁcant role at different points
in the season in terms of taking on the scor-
ing load I '

’ If the team can get the ball in Patterson’s
hands, his ability to both score and create
opportunities with his passing will be a dif-

ference maker, especially for Newkirk, who I

has played in an expanded role since redshirt
sophomore Durandjohnson tore his ACL’in
January.

“I am looking to be more aggressive in the
open court,” Newkirk said. “I excel out in the
open court and me pushing the ball creates
opportunities for myself and others to score
and I am going to continue to do tha .”

This Pitt team has the tools in place to be
a successful one. The Panthers have taken
the best teams in the conference and nation
to the ﬁnal possession of games on multiple
occasions. I ' t - . ’

They have also been in top form in the last
week led by a pair of seniors who seem ready
to take a Pitt team over the hump. _

Either way, it only seems ﬁtting with this

A ing. ESPN recruiting rankedhim asthe 58th-

Neither Artis nor Dixon are surprised,
though, as the results are merely the fruits
of Artis’ labor. _ '

“It’s great to see him emerge as afreshrnan

Four keys for Pitt to go
deep in March Madness

Jeremy Tepper
Staff Writer

Pittfans know the disappointment alltoo well:

Aftera great regular season, the Panthers make»

an early exit out of the NCAA Tournament,

oftentrumped byahotterteam orastarplayer. V

Whether it’s because oftheir own deﬁcien-

_ cies or strong competition, the Panthers can’t

seem to avoid the trend underjamie Dixon.
This year’s teamis differentthan past years,

. though, for better or for worse.

For better, Pitt has a dynamic player who
can take over a game in Lamar Patterson. For
worse, Pitt, very simply," hasn’t been able to

' i beat quality teams‘. On the year, Dixon’s squad

is 2-7 against teams in the Ratings Percentage
Index Top 50. ‘’
Because of an overall weak ﬁeld, an op-
portunistic fan might surmise that Pitt could
make a run, spearheaded by Patterson’s star
power. Realistically, though, Pittwillhave to be
extremely lucky to make it to the Sweet Sixteen.

V To make a run in the tournament, a team -

needs everything to work well or must have
the talent to make up for its mistakes. Pitt,
conversely, needs far too many variables to
work and lacks the talent to make up ground
if a couple of those variables aren’t working.

But let’s say Pitt inconceivably starts clicking '

on allfacets and makes a deep run. What needs
to go right for the Panthers?

Well, quite a bit.

Mainly, they need to make four‘inconsis—
tencies consistent, plus a bit of luck.

1. Talib Zanna ﬁnding his zone
While Patterson is Pitt’s clear No. 1 scorer, ﬁfth-

. year senior Zanna has usually been Pitt’s No.

2. This year, Zanna has averaged 12.6 points a
game, a quality number for a big man.
Despite the solid scoring number, Zanna
has generally been inconsistent. In one game,
he makes virtually everything around the rim,
and then the next he struggles to make easy,
high—percentage shots. V
Zanna’s job isn’t all that difficult on the
offensive end. As long as he stays active, Pat-

_ terson, James Robinson, Josh Newkirk and

Cameron Wright will ﬁnd him and deliver a
good pass.
For Zanna, his problem isn’t staying active,

but ﬁnishing his shot opportunities when he
gets them. His shots are almost always from
high—percentage spots, but he doesn’t con-
sistently ﬁnish strongly and decisively. That’s
often because he has struggled to make quick,
smart decisions with the ball. _ ‘ ,

When he’s off, he’s passing up open mid-
range jumpers for poor shots off drives. and
double and triple pumping when he receives
the ballindeep position. Ifzanna makes smart
decisions with the ball, then he should have
no problem being a more—thpan-viable second
option. ' l

2. Keep the enemies close and the score
closer . » A , T

For Pitt to win games against good teams,
it needs to force its opponents into defensive
battles. With unreliable scorersoutside of Pat-

terson, Pitt often struggles to put the ball in

the basket.

'If teams are able to play their"tempo up
and down the court and ﬁnd quality shots,
the Panthers generally can’t win. But if Dixon
and his squad can force their opponents into

grind—it-out ugly defensive battles, they can V

keep most games close. .

Taking a look at Pitt’s games against good
opponents, almost all of them were close, low-
scoring games. i «

Against Cincinnati, Virginia and Syracuse
— all top-15 teams —— Pittwas able to keep the

, score reach by slowing down its oppoi

nent and limiting possessions. The Panthers
did loseallofthose games, but itallcame down
to the ﬁnal minutes.

When Pitt was unable to slow the game :

against North Carolina and Duke, itwas thor-
oughly outplayed and lost easily. _
Since Dixon has mostly abandoned using

. zone defense, Pitt needs to be strongin its

traditional man-to-man scheme. To do so,

the Panthers need to play smart and physical, A

bumping their opponents when they can and
making quick switches. ’

If they can do that, they’ll be able to force
their opponent to a low-possession game,

which most teams aren’t comfortable with.

3. Bring inthe backup .
A lack of secondary scorers has proved a

ESPN’s scouting report noted‘ that
Newkirk “will need to steady his perimeter

ate dividends. Statistically, he’s been Pitt’s best
3-point shooter, making 21-of-46 threes fora

ﬁve of his attempts from distance.

Despite not having the reputation,
Newkirk isn’t surprised abouthis results after
the effort he put in over the summer.

“I spent long nights in the gym getting up
a lot of shots, and it’s paid off,” Newkirk said.

When Newkirk arrived at Pitt, Dixon rec- .
ognized that. '

“Josh made it pretty clear when he got’
here how well he shot the ball, and itwas evi-»
dent early. We were very forttmate withtha ,”
Dixon said. “Heworks at it andis a greatki .”r

But things weren’t always working for
Newkirkthis season. ’ - -

For the ﬁrst half of the season, Newkirk

played  He often looked lost while -

trying to guidehis team, made aimless passes’
and mostly opted notto usehis speedto drive.
Simply put, he looked like a freshman.
As he’s gotten more and more comfortable,
though, he’s taken ﬁill grasp of the offense.
Having Robinson, a quality point guard"
who also took on large responsibilities as a
freshman, playing with him has been a large
part of his development. V
“I can go to James about anything, any
little thing,” Newkirk said. “He’s a good role
model, and I’ve learned a lot from him.”
it Before the offense, though, Newkirk had

of to ﬁrst show the ability to defend in order to

take’ on a substantial role. Not many fresh:
men can defend at the necessary level for

P Dixon to have trust in them, but 

demonstrated he could. % ’ ’ '1' <
“That’s whatjosh has done ﬁrst and fore-
most, and now you’re seeing theoffense come
with it,” Dixon said. “He’s an asset on the de-
fensive en .” ' « . 
Newkirk’s improvements culminated
March 8 against Clemson, when Pitt kept
itselfoff the bubble with a 83-78 win. As the

ﬁnal seconds dwindled with his team down -

two points and the ball loose on the ﬂooroff

; an inbounds steal, Newkirk picked the ball up

Calmly, he sunk the jump shot to send the
game to overtime. The playwas amicrocosm

talented, but he’s composed as well.

talent, but their skills are not ﬁne-tuned.
Their consistent scoring is crucial in
order for Pitt to win several games in the
tournament, according to Dixon. It became
especially important when Johnson got
hurt, something Newkirk recognizes, and
he’s made a concerted effort to take on more
scoring responsibility since the injury.

“I’m looking to be more aggressive in the‘

open court,” Newkirk said. “Me pushing the
ball creates other opportunities for other
people to score, and I’m going to continue
to do tha .” "

Artis has taken a different approach.
Instead, he doesn’t especially look to score,
but focuses more on rebounding and taking
advantage of his scoring chances when he
gets them. . p

“I never really looked at scoring, Artis said.
“I just play within the offense.”

In additionto being consistent offensive
threats, it’s perhaps even more important for

the freshmen to be solid defensively.

“They got to be able to defend for us to
give us an opportunity,” Dixon said. “You may
score some buckets, but if you’re giving up
more on the other end, then it’s not helpful
to our team.” '

Whether or not they can provide the nec-
essary offense and defense for the Panthers

‘ to make. a deep run in the tournament re-

mains to be seen. For Artis, it’s no question
that they will. I

“I just want to make a good run,” Artis
said. “And I know we will.” ﬁ ‘

4. Rebound like the game depends on it
There’s a reason why Dixon harps on re-
bounding. Whenatearn can limit its opponent

 

to one-shot possessions and then extend pos- ’

sessions with offensive rebounds, that team
can make up a talent gap. For mostteams, the
3-point shot is the great equalizer.

But for Pitt, a team that isn’t made up of

long—range sharpshooters, rebounding, espe- V

cially offensive, can level the playing ﬁeld — if
not skewing it in the Panthers’ favor.

On the season, Pittranks aseemingly poor
No. 104 in rebounds per game, but Pitt’s slow
pace (No. 299 in adjusted tempo) lowers that
stat even further. In a more useful number, the
Panthers rank No. 17 in rebounding margin,
out-rebounding their opponents an average

‘ of 6.4 rebounds per game. -
It’s almost comical how predictable Dixon

can be in press conferences, usually blaming
reboundingforawin or loss. He’s right, though.
Generally, when Pitt doesn’t have a large
talent advantage, the Panthers win when they
rebound well and lose when they don’t.
IfPitt is going to control the boards against

\ opponents, its frontcourt needs to come up

big. Namely, Zanna will need to continue his
success in grabbing rebounds after he ﬁnished

I - second-bestintheACC with 8.4 rebounds per

game. When he’s athis best, he’s ﬁercely grab-
bing defensive rebounds andis extremely active
on the offensive end, feasting on tip-ins and
put backs.

Looking at two of Pitt’s better conference
performances, the Panthers out-rebounded
Wake Forest by 10 in the ﬁrst gamejan. 11 and
eight in last Thursday’s game,'then won by 15
and 29 points, respectively. On the other side,
in two games when Pitt was thoroughly out-

. played and lost, it split on the boards against

North Carolina, and_Duke out-rebounded the
Panthers by ﬁve.
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.
In both of Pitt’s heart-breaking losses to

~ Syracuse, the Panthers were the victors on

the boards, out-rebounding the Orange by 11
in both games. These games are a testament

- to the positive effects of rebounding, though,

as Pitt was able to nearly win both despite in-
ferior talent.

That just goes to show that basketball is
a game of breaks. But the Panthers have the

‘ groundwork laid out to minimize the impact

of the unpredictable. ﬂ

with the chairs, Cooper suspended
admissions to the graduate programs
on April 5, 2012, for a period of review.

The decision. shocked the chairs and
raised concerns about what direction the
University is taking.

Possanza said faculty and staff come
to work to perform exceptionally and feel
like they are part of the University but
noted that “it’s hard to feel that way when
the ground is shifting under your feet.”

“You don’t reallyfeel like you know
what is happening or what you can do to
do the best job that you can do, because
the change is happening so fast and you
just are not prepared for it,” he added.

-Adam Shear, interim religious stud-
ies chair, said he thinks the University
obeyed the bylaws, but the situation was
rushed and unfair. ,

‘ﬂxs soon as admissions to these pro-

grams were suspended -— even though

there should have been a presumption of
innocence — it shifted over to a presump-

tion of closing the programs,” Shear said.
Timing is everything i
In her letter on Jan. 30, Beeson said
the Dietrich School weighed the poten-
tial negative impact on the programs
resulting from the early announcement

(referring to the April 2012 suspension) V

versus the potential negative impact that
prospective students would suffer from
a delayed announcement.
‘There is never a good time to make
such an announcement,” Beeson said.
Lyon said he thinks Beeson was closely
involved in the process from the start
and didn’t fault Beeson and Cooper for
making a difﬁcult decision. A‘
A “I would ask them to follow proper
procedures,”-Lyon said.
According to the Dietrich School’s by-
laws, Dietrich School Council actions take

effect 30 days after they are published
the minutes of the Dietrich School 

zette. The Gazette is a bimonthly publi-
cation that serves as the formal record

of council activity and faculty personnel ’

actions. . _ c g  ,
According to Lyon, there wasno

Possanza said there would have been
practical advantages to an earlier noti-
ﬁcation.

“Are you bound to follow your own
rules? That’s the question,” Lyon said.

He said he would have requested an
external review from the.University.

During an external review, members
of the speciﬁc academic ﬁeld who are
from outside the University critique and
evaluate the program. '

“What might seem weak or strong at
Pitt might not seem weak or strong to the
professional world,” Lyonsaid.

Lyon said he sent a request for an ex-
ternal review to Senior Associate Dean of
Arts and Sciences James Knapp in 2011,
but never received a response. ‘

All three departments have not re-
ceived an external review since the ’90s. .

In her statement, Provost Beeson ref-
erenced the timing of initial suspension
as “one of the most discussed procedural
issues.” . ,' C A h c " -

Beeson said". the Dietrich School
“weighed in favorofalerting prospective
students to the possibility of the program
closure.” , 1 V y 1

The approval process .

The program chairs were asked on
May 15, 2012, to submit responses and/
or alternative proposals by Oct. 1, 2012.
The Dietrich School Graduate Council re-
viewed the submission on April 12, 2013.

The council approved proposals for
indeﬁnite suspension of the classics and
German graduate programs and termi-
nation of the religious studies graduate
program. ,

The proposals were sent to the -Diet-
rich School Council and the department
chairs on April 16, 2013. The classics
and German departments responded to

‘the proposals by May 10. The Council
postponed its vote by a week to allow

council members to reflect on the chairs’
responses. ..

The Dietrich School’s Planning and
Budget Committee approved the propos-
als, and Cooper submitted the proposals
to Beeson onjune 4.

Opportunity for public comment did
not come until Sept. 17, 2013, when the
University Council on Graduate Studies

March 17, 2014 | The Pitt News | vvx/vvv.pittne\/vs.com

V discussed the proposals during an open
meeting at the University Club.

Lyon said the chairs were not invited
to attend any of the prior private meet-
ings.

Graduate faculty members received
copies of the proposals, the chairs’ writ-

ten responses and comments from faculty.

and students opposing the suspensions
or termination. For one hour of the meet-
ing, the graduate faculty members could
address the council for ﬁve minutes each.

“There were again dozens of faculty

expressing their concern,” Lyon_said. “It
was at that level where you ﬁrst saw votes

which weremuch closer, and that this is— a

sue was not as cut and dry as it seemedto
appear in the Dietrich councils.”
Impact on undergraduate studies
The elimination of graduate programs
means no graduate assistants, and the
chairs of the cut programs say the loss
will ‘affect undergraduate students. A
Lyon said his department has some
“really strong” part—time instructors who
will take over the courses and recitations

/sfv

taught by graduate students.

But he said that he is concerned-about
losing the enthusiasm graduate students,
who are usually ﬁrst-time teachers, bring
to instruction, which he said is crucial to
teaching a language.

“[Graduate students] put in a little
extra effort, and [they] take it a lot more
personally. They bring in energy and in-
tensity that is hard for me as a long—time
professor to replicate,” Lyon said.

Possanza said a “generational factor”
also contributes to graduate students’
fervor. -

-“They’re young.’ They are excited.
They know more about popular culture,”
he said. “They are able to build a rapport
with the students in a way that can be
more difficult for older faculty.”

V In her letter, Beeson said she, Cooper
and the Dietrich School “will remain com-
mitted to undergraduate programs in
these departments.” ' ,

Shear and the other chairs said the
move will negatively affect the caliber
of faculty they can attractto teach their
undergraduate programs.

“Part ofwhat scholars do is train the
next generation of researchers,” Shear
said. “We may have trouble ﬁlling posi-
tions with very. high~quality staff who
would want to combine the training of
undergraduateswith ‘engagement in fac-
ulty research.” -

It also produces a cloud of uncertainty
around the programs.

Possanza said job candidates might
wonder what the future holds for the
department. V.

Depending on the University’s plan,
class sizes might shrink, and recitation
slots could close without graduate stu-
dents. ' ' I

The chairs are worried the reductions
will have a ripple affect, negatively im-
pacting the undergradtiate and graduate
programs that shared interdisciplinary
programs with the closed programs.

Leaving the conversation V

Religious studies is a hot topic, and
Shear and Theodore Pulcini, a graduate
of Pitt’s religious studies Ph.D. program,
worry that Pitt is inhibiting itself by not

sending students into the dialogue.

“The purpose of the university. is to

Q FROM PAGE 28

GRADUATE 0

provide the society with people who are
able to engage in the kind of dialogues
necessary for the advan‘cement of our
culture,” Pulcini said.

For Pulcini, the range.of faiths that
exist in American culture provide sub-
stantial reason to study religion. '

“People have to be able to take a schol-
arly stance and look at religion with a
kind of objectivity that is necessary for
a pluralisticculture like ours,” he said.

Pulcini, a professor at Dickinson Col—
lege in Carlisle, Pa., obtained his Ph.D. in
religious studies from Pitt in 1994 after
studying at Harvard and Notre Dame. D

Pulcini saitl the diversity and history
of immigrant religious groups in Western
Pennsylvania provided him with an edu-
cation he could not have obtained at other
universities such as Boston University or
Harvard graduate school.

He called Pittsburgh a“living library
of religious pluralism.”

Pulcini said he taught eight classes

while completing his Ph.D. at Pitt and
beneﬁted from the University’s collabo-
ration with the Pittsburgh, Theological
Seminary. 0

He was offered a job at Dickinson Col—
lege very shortly after graduation and has
worked at the college ever since.

, Pulcini said he’s served on a number of

-budget committees faced with tough deci-

sions during his time at Dickinson College
and knows it is a difficult decision.

He added that he does not think the
University doesn’t care, but.feels the deci-
sion was"‘short—sighted,” a concern that
he addressed to Beeson last summer.

Pulcini said he received a brief email
response from Beeson’s office.’ .

“[The program closure] will in the
long-run undercut the University’s con-
tribution to the public discourse center-
ing on religion, a discourse that appears
to be increasing in signiﬁcance with every
passing year,” Pulcini said in the email.

Looking Ahead .

Debate surrounds the University’s
process to cut the three programs, but

' the chairs and Pitt’s chapter of the AAUP
‘ are looking ahead and wondering what

might be next for the University’s faculty .

and programs.

According to Pitt’s AAUP report, “It

is imperative, especially in times of ﬁs-
cal austerity and political scrutiny, that
faculty remain fully involved in decisions
regarding academic programs and not
just in a token role.”Beeson addressed
this concern in herjan. 30 letter. _

She said the University is committed
to making program closure decisions in
line with Pitt’s structure of shared gov-
ernance between the councils and ad-
ministration. , ‘ A

Shear said it is not simply a matter of
losingthe ﬁght, picking up their marbles
and going home.

Shear, as well as the other chairs, said
the conversation can’t end andthat they
are foreseeing where their lines of study
will continue to exist at the University
through interdisciplinary programs.

“I’m not predicting doom and gloom.
I’m saying this decision should not end
the conversation. This decision is a piece
of what has to be a much larger conversa-
tion,” Shear said. I ‘
