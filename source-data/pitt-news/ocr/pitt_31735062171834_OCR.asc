Krenicky, Solomon, Hurwitze
Take MDC Honors

by BOB GING
News Editor.

As compared to the meagre five per cent
turnout in January’s Student Association elec-
tion, the recent Men’s Dormitory Council
(MDC) election boasted almost a 25 per cent
voter turnout. Four hundred and twenty-two
students voted in the MDC election on Wednes-
day.

Taking the leadership role in MDC will be Ken
Krenicky, a freshman, who will succeed Arnie
Steinberg as president.

Krenicky, who ran on an anti-apathy ticket, in-
tends to try to foster more student involvement in
the dormitory decision making processes. Com-
menting on the perenial SAGA food issue, Krenicky
stated, “We’ve got the power to talk to them

Sigma Chi pledge and former MDC cultural and
community relations chairman.

Voicing his opinion on the heated security issue,
the president-elect commented, “If they are going
to use security doors, they should either use them
all the way or not at all.” ‘

Other changes which he intends to work towards
will be a campus bus stop at the Towers, “so that
students won’t have to walk all the way to the Cathe-
dral to catch the campus bus” and a feasibility
study of cable TV for the Towers.

Serving with Krenicky will be newly MDC Secre-
tary Andy Solomon, a sophomore English major
from McCormick Hall.

Solomon lists as prior experience a year as so-
cial chairman for the House of the Rising Sun, MDC
senator and a member of the McCormick Dorm

(SAGA) and they will listen.”

Intending to major in history, Krenicky is also a

Council.

Conference Friday at Penn State

Students to Plan

by ALBERT R. WYNN

College students from all over
the state will be meeting at Penn
State University on Friday to dis-
cuss issues and make plans for a
student lobby in Harrisburg.

‘Concerning the goal of the stu-
dent lobby, Dennis Concilla, Pro-
gram Commissioner, said,
“Hopefully a student lobby will
give college students a greater
voice in the State House on bills
which directly or indirectly af-
fect them. Further, it will give
legislators a more direct link with
student ideas and allow for great-
er student input into certain areas
of policy.”

The idea and plans for Friday’s

meeting came through the efforts ,

of students at Pitt, Temple, Penn
State and the University of Penn-
sylvania. In all, 136 colleges have
been invited for the three-day ses-
sion of workshops and discussions.

Featured will be various mem-
bers of the Pennsylvania legisla-
ture. They will be on hand toipro-
vide ideas and feedback on some
of the student proposals, as well
as just meeting with and talking
to college students. , A

In addition, there will be panel
discussions with such officials as
Peter Yaffe. assistant to the Gov-
ernor; Herbert Packer, lobbiest
for the State Building Associa-
tion; and John Cowan_, Public In-
formation director.

OCH Committee Shifts to

a Full Steam for Tenant Rights

by KATHY McCANN

The riewly-organized Student
Association (SA) Off-Campus
Housing Committee (OCH) is
avidly attempting to assist stu-
.dents in the Oakland area.

The Committee, which is in the
process of surveying student ten-
ants, is chaired by Frank Little
and Kathy McCann. An analysis
of the survey results will provide
the groundwork for a comprehen-
sive handbook on off-campus liv-
ing. In addition, inquiries were
made at several urban universi-
ties across the country to discov-
er the manner in which other
schools are coping with the situa-
tion.

Anyone with a complaint about
1 his housing conditions should call
the SA office. A member of the
committee will be in touch with
information and assistance from
the Allegheny Department of
Health. Questions on leases and
other legal aspects will be han-
dled by the Legal Awareness Sub-
committee on Off-Campus Hous-
ing.

Representatives of OCH plan to
regularly attend meetings of Peo-
ple’s Oakland and Model ‘Cities,
Hopefully, these organizations will

,.s.. . ,

 

take the problem of student hous-
ing in Oakland into consideration
when forming community pro-
grams.

On March 23, OCH and the Le-
gal Awareness Committee" (LAC),
chaired by Bob Ging, are co-spon-
soring a seminar in the Student
Union ballroom. People from
these groups will be present,
along with members of the Hous-
ing Office, Neighborhood Legal
Services, and, tentatively, the ma-
jor Oakland realtors.

The purpose of the seminar is to‘

provide the opportunity for real-
tors to answer queries‘ from their
present tenants and, at the same
time. solicit new ones. The legal
service organizations will be
available for referral with prob-
lems students are unable to nego-
tiate with the landlords.

According to Ging, “The LAC
intends to implement any action
taken by OHC and to handle the
legal aspects of tenant-landlord
disputes.”

The Pitt News is planning a
supplement encompassing a wide
range of legal alternatives for stu-
dent tenants, including a state-
ment of tenants‘ rights and the
building code of the FHA-. The Pitt

News has already published an ex-

 

planation of rent withholdingpro-:  

cedures. -

It is suggested that the supple-

CL   Elevators Frosh, Two Sophs To Head MDC V
To Be Computerized      

by CAROLE COVAL

Westinghouse Electric will be-
gin work on the Cathedral of
Learning elevators on April 19, in
an effort to have them compu-
terized by early Fall 1971.

, Hunt V. Martin, director of the
V. University Physical Plant, said
- the “temporary inconvenience of
, one less elevator at a time will
eventually yield a satisfactory
elevator system in the fall. 

Computerized service will pro-
vide higher speed and be able to
accommodate itself to increased
loading flow during rush hours.

Because the elevators. will no
longer require operators, there
has been much concern on the
part of the student body as to the
fate of the present operators as
computerization slowly takes over.

 

“We informed the operators of
the potential change about seven
months ago,” Martin said. “We,
hope to place those who want to
remain with the University in
other positions.

 “The idea of computerized ele-
1., vators has been around for six or
. seven years,” he said. “We’ve
been trying to devise a system of
rehauling that will cause the least
inconvenience to students.

“Computerized elevators will
greatly improve service,” Martin
_said. “The present elevators are
over 40 years old and they are out

“We have definite plans for at
least twoof the four operators
who will be phased out in April,"
Martin said. “We’ll keep each of
the men working as operators as
long as possible until we can relo-

 Housing Opens Food Bids

Rather than start its own food
service, the University will soon
open bids to serve the entire food
‘service next year.

The present contract with SAGA
food service expires in late Aug-
ustand John Vrana, Housing di-
rector, will be sending out speci-
fication sheets to SAGA and other

a prospective companies.

According to a press release
from Gary Houston of the Student

I ~ Affairs office, the possibility of

Pitt starting its own food opera-
tion had been considered, but it
was decided to study the matter

. in more detail.

Students and staff will be

  I SAGA Faces Competion

broadly involved in such a deci-
sion, Houston said.

After Vrana sends out the Uni-
versity’s requirements and dead-
line information to the various
food services, a student—staff
committee will review the bids
and make a, recommendation in
mid-May.

Applications are being opened
at this early date to give the com-
mittee time to thoroughly review
the bids.

The competitive bidding will
hopefully result in the selection

V of a quality food service for next

year, according to Houston.

Hillman Offers Aid

Hillman Library information
services will again conduct a
clinic to help undergraduates
with their term qpers.

The clinic will help students
find good sources, and discover
bibliographic tools not found in
the card catalog.

Students must register in ad-

vance at the reference desk,
ground floor, Hillman Library.
A specific time period will be
scheduled, convenient to the
individual and the librarian.

This personalized service
will run for the whole term.
Students should sign up now to
get an early start on their paper.

Nixon Seeks Draft Extension

The current draft law has been
on the books since 1948. Most
parts of it are permanent legisla-
tion. For example: the Selective
Service System requirement to
register at 18 years, etc. But Sec-
tion 17(c) is limited. In it, Con-
gress gives the President author-
ity to induct young men, tradition-
ally four years at a time. The
current authority for the Presi-
dent to induct expires midnight
June 30. If it is not extended, the

specter of the draft will end for
millions of young men.

The Administration has request-
ed a two year extension of au-
thority to induct, until July 1,
1973. The Administration is also
seeking to end deferments, divin-
ity student exemptions and a call
of inductees on a national rather
than a local basis. (S427. Sens.
Stennis, Miss.; Smith, Me.) The
Administration has also request-
ed an increase of'$1.5 billion in

Glee Club   Pa.

  

by JIM MAC
For many members of the Men's Glee Club the
high point of the academic term is the annual tour.
Said Steve Nedmyer, a tenor in the University Chor-
al group, “This winter’s trip to the Philadelphia
area and the top at Cabrini were especially enjoy-
able. Things went well and everyone had a grea
time. It was a real treat. ‘

Thirty-five men, under the direction of Phil Cav-
anaugh, recently completed a weekend singing ex-
cursion through eastern Pennsylvania.

The Club-left Schenley Hall Friday and traveled
by bus to Northampton Area High School, near Al-

lentown, where they put on a “mutually enjoyable” '

50-minuted performance.

“The students of Northampton were very recep-
tive,” Medmyer said, “and the school invited us
back. High schools usually like us, though, because

we're college and because we can sing.”

Concerts on tour were divided—the first half
being of a formal nature and the second, informal.

Saturday, after driving to Philly, the Club did
two short programs at the King of Prussia Shopping
Center. The members were provided with meals
and the group given a $200 honorarium by the Plaza
Merchants Association. -

“The climax of the trip,” according to Nedmyer,
a junior in his third year on tour with the Club, “was
the final stop at Cabrini College,” a Catholic girls
school near Radnor.

“They had a mixer for us Saturday night and
then found us sleeping _rooms in neighboring homes
or at nearby Villanova. Sunday we did a concert to-
gether and it turned out alright. I hope,” he added
jokingly, “they enjoysed us as much as we enjoyed
them."

Nedmyer described the tour as, overall, better
organized and more smoothly run than tours of the
past. “We all enjoyed singing and we enjoyed the
trip. The ‘bus driver was great and the whole

,, weekend seemed like a vacation. I’m looking for-

Area IRS Head Warns
Against Misleading Ads

Taxpayers are warned against

H. Alan Long; district director
of Internal Revenue for Western
Pennsylvania, said the ads placed

Mr. Long said the IRS has tried
to make improvements in the
form and in filing procedures in
response to numerous suggestions
from taxpayers, lawyers, accoun
tants, and others. In addition, the 
Internal Revenue Service Cen
ters have this year offered to fig
ure the income tax and retirement V
income credit for up tol30 million '0
taxpayers filing 1970 returns.

Taxpayers should also be care
ful of “guarantees” offered b
some commercial preparers of

they will represent the taxpaye

said. Generally, only attorneys,
CPA’s, and those who, by demon
strating their qualifications, ar
enrolled for practice, can repre-_
sent a taxpayer before the IRS. 5
Taxpayers should be sure of just ‘
what is meant by a “guarantee” 7
offered by a preparer. -

Mr. Long said that if a taxpayer
employs a commercial preparer-
to fill out his return, he should se
lect a reputable one. Regardless V
of who fills in the form, the tax if
payer is responsible for the accur
acy of the return.

The two words were; “next

they were said was very matter- I

of-factly. The presidents impli-
cation was very clear—The war
in Indo China will be going on
all this year, which is by the
way only barely. into its third
month. I A V

,, Nixon was indirectly saying
last night—that all the demon-
strations all the songs, poems,

P public outcries, placards, bump-

fy to these circumstances. and the oper-
ation must be done in-an accredited hos-
I pital. Most of the remaining states permit
therapeutic abortion solely when a wom-
en’s life is clearly in danger. I

Because of the conditions of those
slightly more liberalized abortion laws,
several major faults have become appar-
ent in them recently. These are perhaps
best summed up by the American Civil
Liberties Union, which, in a statement

adopted ini1968, declared that the abor-

American violence, not only out

On the other hand, I must say,
I have very little fear, from first-

the proximate threat of extinc-

Berrigans
'Repressed’

The editor; The Pitt News,

On February 8, 1971, Equbal
Ahmad, Fr. Philip Berrigan, Sr.
Elizabeth McAlister, Fr. Neil
McLaughlin, Anthony Scoblick,
and Fr. Joseph Wenderoth were
arraigned in Harrisburg on
charges of conspiring to blow
up underground heating tunnels
in Washington and to kidnap pre-
sidential adviser Henry A. Kis-
singer.

This is yet another example of
the repressive measure being
taken by the federal government
in an attempt to silence dissent
and thwart anti-war activities.

Having heard these defendents
speak at the press conference
following the arraignment, we
were overwhelmed by the sin-
cerity and conviction with which
they spoke of their belief in a
nonviolent revolution.

It is, in fact, the government,
not these six defendents, that
has committed crimes against
humanity. It is, in fact, the gov-
ernment that should be on trial.

We ask you to join us in work-
ing with the local defense com-
mittee in supporting these six
defendents who have dedicated
themselves to ending the war in
Vietnam.

D0n’s Ideals
'El0quent’

Editor, he Pitt News;
Dear Don,

I was heartened to read your
editorial in the January 25 issue
of The Pitt News. As an idealist
also, I still believe, as I always
have, that there is still hope
for the world; but I also believe
that hope lies in love not hate.

Ironically though, in black-
white relations, now that many

blacks -— particularly younger
ones—are reversing prejudice
and trying to repay in kind what-
ever hatred they’ve experienced.

Not that they don’t have valid
reasons for wanting to, but in
doing so unfortunately, they’re
falling into the bag that white
racists have been in for a long
time, and directing their hat-
red and bitterness at all whites,
which includes some sincere and
genuine individuals who may
not deserve their animosity.

I try to see people as indivi-
duals, which really isn’t hard,
since everyone is a unique in-
dividual; and even though my
hair is blond and my eyes are
blue, I too, would like to be

seen as an individual, and not
as a WASP. Blacks should cer-
tainly understand this desire.
Isn’t that what it’s all about?

    

Surely nothing is to be gain-
ed by bitterness; in fact, there’s
much to be lots, if nothing else,
bitterness and hatred are poison
to the soul. Even Cleaver said,
“The price of hating other hu-
man beings is loving oneself
less.” But I don’t need to tell
you that, since you are obvious-
ly a person who thinks for him-
self.

Mostly I just wanted to tell
you I’m glad there are still idea-
lists left, and try to hold onto
that idealism, in spite of racist
institutions, both black and
white, that would try to con-
vince you that idealism will
never work.

I commend you for speaking
out . . . . and for doing it so elo-
quently.

Crass, Ironic

Dear Editor, The Pitt News,

I see a strange irony and
crassness in the latest national
and local news recently. The
irony of the bombing of the
Capitol and the --simultaneous
continuation of hearings on the
spying of civilians by the De-
fense Department is interesting
indeed.

Is it any more ironic that
Washington is not going to give
money to a bankrupt Pennsyl-
vania economy or that New York
City must fire 6,500 teachers,
because Washington refuses to
meet needs for funds?

But perhaps the strangest irony
is that to all American, South
Vietnamese soldiers and North
Vietnamese are dead.

Is it any wonder desperate and
perhaps fanatic young people
could have blown up part of the
Capitol. Maybe the Defense
Department should look into its
own machine of killing before
it decides who is socially incom-
patible in American society.

George Orwell’s 1984 should
not be thought in terms of Sov-
iet ‘Russia alone but in terms of
“democratic America" as well.

Constitutional rights if they
are not protected from the com-
puter may well become the
gravestone of American Stand-
ards rather then the cornerstone.

New Names,

Old, Old War

To the Editor:

The dates change and so do
the names, but the policy re-
mains the same. During most
of the sixties the names were
Johnston, Humphrey, McNamara

 

and Westmoreland. Now the
names are Nixon, Agnew, Laird
and Abrams. New people, new
party, same old war.

In 1964 Johnston defeated
Goldwater for the presidency.
Johnston promised not to esca-
late the war. He lied. In 1968
Nixon said he had a plan to
end the war. He lied also.

I’m sure the next Democratic
presidential candidate will
have a fool proof peace plan for
the “72” elections. And in 1976,
when the war is still going on,
there will be yet another idea
for a conclusion to the war.

Yes, the war will drag on

year after bloody year. It won’t -
end until the military and in-
dustrial complex gives it’s con-
sent. And no one can even be-
gin to guess when that will be.
Makes a person feel rather help-
less, doesn’t it?

IS ex raor inari y s o - true

tory of genocide is probably con-
nected with the fact that the main
contention of the writer is that,
“(Genocide’s) political roots to-

day are imperia1ism—-the stage of
capitalism in which national or ra-
cial groups are oppressed for
profit, and racism-—the system of
white supremacy which justifies
the oppression of non-whites on
the basis that they are “inferior”
or less human.” ‘

Genocide is indeed old, as any-
one with even a child’s knowledge
of history could tell you, and it is
far too old to be associated in par-
ticular with a “capitalist” eco-
nomic system or with feelings of
white supremacy.

Celts and Babylonians, Phoeni-
cians and Illyrians-—all were na-
tions that once existed and now
are gone, like the dinosaurs.

Countless nations never got into
the history books when they were
wiped out, and of some “lost” cul-
tures whose abandoned cities
mystify us today we cannot even
know—nor does it matter—who it
was who destroyed them.

Nor can the writer of the arti-
' cle even reasonably maintain that

‘ in modern times genocide is the

product only of “capitalism” or of
the idea of white supremacy.

   
 

One of the fea-
tures of the “so-
cialist” period in
the lands of the
Soviet Union is
is the replace-
ment of the small- A
er nationalities
with Russians.

When possible,
this is done gent-
ly: by enforced
Russian language
training, the lure
of better oppor-

.'~""'R


tunities for advancement given to
Russians, assignment of Russians
to jobs in other “republics” and
minority group membersito work
in Russia, etc.

When, however, it has been

more convenient to use force,.

whole populations have been re-
settled to Siberia or simply liq-
uidated. a

Khrushchev, in his 1963“‘Se-
cret Speech" against Stalin, ad-
mitted that Stalin had exiled four
complete nationality groups and
would have deported all Ukraini-
ans to Siberia as well, had the

» task not been simply too immense

for him.

 

For all of this the reasoning is
that the forced assimilation into
Russia or China erases the “arti-
ficial” barriers of culture and
language that hinder the coming
of an international human culture.

What does all of this ‘talk of
genocide have to do with Vietnam?
Nothing.

If our government or army had
consciously set out to kill off the
Vietnames people in the same
way that Hitler resolved to elim-
inate the Jews or Mao to elimin-
ate the Tibetans, there would ob-
viously be no Vietnamese left by
this time.

If a de facto genocide of Viet-
names had been the result of our
participation in the war there,
the article woulld certainly have
pointed out some net loss in the
population statistics.

In fact, however, any statistical
yearbook will show that there has
been a considerable population

growth in both North and South

Vietnam.

down everything. criticizes the establishment for everything it does from polluting the
earth; from creating racism to trying to change it in a half-hearted manner.

It even tears down interpersonal relationships by an abundance of simulated fornication
on the stage. The play does nothing but destroy; it leaves a blank space where the estab-
lishment, and makes no attempt to fill it with alternatives.

But these three people showed me that I had been guilty of the same things that are cri-
ticized in Hair. I had stereotyped them and judged them before I had heard them. and it had
been the wrong thing to do. Through their attitudes toward each other and toward the play.
I could see what they were trying to do.

What convinced me was the honesty of Banks. Though he evaded our eyes, and seemed
possessed by some sort of demon that drove him to thoughts that he couldn’t communicate
to criticize the establishment and everything that‘s wrong with the world. yet we have the
nerve to charge nine bucks a seat to see the show." And from that point on we didn't dis-
cuss the play at all.

Instead we discussed what the play meant. what it tried to accomplish. We told of our
personal encounters with racism and bigotry. Michael Brown said that here. in Pittsburgh.

These people saw Hair as a small chance for them to do something about the mess our
world is in. a chance to give something to the audiences that were attracted by the mere sen-
sationalism of a nude scene.

The simulated fornication scenes which I had thought of as destructive to interperson-
al relationships. became incentives to question even my relationships with others.

On Saturday evening at 8:40, Dr. Steinberg will conduct the or-
chestra in a special benefit concert for the orchestra's Pension Fund.
The gala Pension Fund benefit concert will feature the world renown-
ed pianist Rudolf Serkin playing two popular piano concertos: Men-
delssohn’s Pinao Concerto No. 1 G Minor and Beethoven’s Piano Con-

Flick Capsules

Thrill,

by STEVE ZYCH

Since most film-goers attend
their flicks at their favorite local
theaters, I have decided to do
some “mini—reviews” of some
films that I feel are among the
best of local releases.

COMEDY

The 12 Chairs, a nutty farce
about a mad jewel hunt in post-
revolutionary Russia is tops in
this category. Based rather loose-
ly upon the satire by Ilf and Pet-
rov’ it was directed in the typical
slapstick style of Mel Brooks,
who also handled the script and
does a bit role in the film.

The simple plot concerns three

men, played by Ron Moody, Dom»

DeLuise, and Frank Langelow,
who search Russia for 12 dining
room chairs, one of which con-
tains a fortune in jewels. The tem-
po is fast, if not at fever pitch at
times, and laughs pile upon
laughs. Combined with all this
terpsichore is a well-combined bit
of closing pathos.

Go see it if comedy’s your bag,
or if you just want a good laugh.

ACTION

For “real” blood and gore go
see Tora, Tora, Tora, which
should have enough death and
destruction for even the most jad-
ed. Besides, it is done in gore-
eous. cinemascopic color done a
scale which has seldom been done
before. The Pearl Harbor bomb-

Home is where the heart is.

Home is also wherever a
Paulist is needed.

Whether the Paulist works
in a ghetto, a college campus,
a city parish or a remote
corner of the United States,
he is serving.

The Paulist is ministering
with words, deeds and sacra-

the needs of God’s People
everywhere. He is meeting
today’s problems with thoughts
of those that will arise
tomorow.

That is the Paulist way. It

ing scenes were handled so real-
istically that the film had been
nominated for an Oscar for spe-
cial effects.

It deserves it—it cost $25,000,-
000 to make and the film should
get something in return as the ink
on the financial returns will at
least match the amount of blood-
letting in the movie itself.

WESTERNS

The best of the three currently
out is a spaghetti western called
Aces High, starring Eli Wallach.
It features the standard Ital-oater
tongue-in-cheek cliches, Ennio
Morricone’s wailing chorus, the
usual beatings and shootings, and,
of course, Eli.

Wallach’s performance lifts the
film above the ordinary and his
raucous performance alone is
worth seeing the film, if you like
Westerns.

DRAMATIC! ,

The winner, almost by default
in this section, has almost got to
be Dairy of a Mad Housewife. The
film which stars newcomer Car-
rie Snodgrass is a good view at a
frustrated upperclass wife who is
scorned and abused by her hus-
band, children and maid . . . and
even by an illicit lover, played
perfectly by another newcomer,
Frank Langella, who also co—stars
in The 12 Chairs.

Her husband, an obnoxious so-

cial—climbing young lawyer, is-

portrayed unconvincingly by Dick
Benjamin. His lack of understand-
ing and obsession with wealth and
pwoer and the lack of love from
him (and her lover) cause the
heroine to have a sudden, climatic
nervous breakdown at the end of
the film.

The film is a good look at some
of the frustrations faced by a
modern housewife in our complex
and ruthless society.

The Politics of Verse: New Genre

by THOMAS NETTER
KNOTS by R. D. Laing
Pantheon Books: $3.95
“If I don’t know I don’t know/I
think I know I don’t know.”

The problem with reviewing a
book by R. D. Laing is that it
should be done by a psychiatrist
who knows his stuff, has uncon-
ventional ideas about his science
and needs a break from the nor-
mal, run—of—the—mill psychiatry
that he has been reading himself
to sleep with.

Of course, the cover blurb tells
us that R. D. Laing is a rebel in
the psychiatric world, a man who
has written normal psych books

and has the honor of having his
latest book, Knots, reviewed on
the front page of the New York
Times. It does not mention that
on Time magazine’s best-seller
list, his book is listed under fic-
tion.

But how do you list this book?
How do you classify a slim, 90
page volume of intricate verse,
of repeated phrases and number-
ed lines, small logical word
games that require three or four
readings? Non-fiction? Future se-
lection of the Psychology Today
book club?

It reminds me of a student who
goes into an engineering course

and asks the professor if instead
of designing a bridge, he can write
a poem about Boulder Dam. The
professor looks at him and then
shakes his head. Of course, the
answer is no. So the enterprising
student designs his bridge, gets an
A, and then for his own amuse-
ment writes his Boulder Dam
poem.

Naturally since no one has ever
written a poem about Boulder
Dam, people begin to take notice.
But there’s an added attraction
in this little story. The kids knows
what he’s talking about. In all
those nifty little metaphors for
sluice gates and drainage tun-
nels, there’s a carefully struc-
tured blueprint for the dam’s
construction.

struction of a dam; it has the au-
thority of being written by an en-
terprising engineering student,
and what’s more, you could build
your own Boulder Dam, just by
reading the book.

It’s picked up by some free-
thinking publisher, printed and
sold for about four dollars. The
book immediately becomes a
best-seller in all the engineering
bookstores, gets rave reviews in
the press, opens a whole new
genre of technological poetry and
gets itself a feature length plug
in the Skyscraper Engineer. And
to finish this story, for lack of a
better classification, they call it
fiction.

Fresh from his hit, The Politics
of Experience, Laing has written
his little volume of mind-benders
in the form of verse. As the cover
tells us again, they can be “read
as poems, or as brief plays, each
complete in itself.” Actually you
can read it any way you want.
You’re going to have to read it
twice or at least a word at a time
to get the meaning.

MORE TO INSANITY

Laing is one of those interesting
people who gives consideration to
the thought that insanity and
schizophrenia might be more than
it appears to be. It might be a vi-
sion of a future, a reflection of
a present world gone mad, a
guide for what awaits us all in the

lian prediction becomes a real-
ity.

Laing’s future is not mass in-
sanity where we will be flying and
gliding in our own worlds as non-
verbal, non-tangible super-beings
without a rational leg to stand on.

It is interesting to see how peo-
ple try to construct irrationality
out of rational, linear means such
as words. It is also interesting to
see how it usually works. And the
most interesting thing of all is
that the irrationality constructed
out ‘of rationality, is the most ra-
tional of all because all the con-
ventional rationality is removef.
leaving only what is really ra-
tional. I

Like Nietzche, who called psy-
chology a vice, Laing is adept at
self-perception. Looking to Laing
for help on Laing, page 56 pre-
sents the following: “You may
know what I don’t know, but not
that I don’t know it. And I can’t
tell you. So you will have to tell me
everything. ”

Last Fall. like every Fall. Pitt
coach Jim Banner began prepar-
ing his tracksters for the Eastern
_indoor championships which
wouldn‘t arrive until March.

March is here. and it’s time
for the IC4A's in Princeton New
Jersey. The whole team has se-
cretly looked forward to the
East's title competition all year
long. and if they don’t win a lot
of people are going to be dissap-
pointed.

This year since the team is
supposed to have achieved the
depth it lacked last ‘year it
would seem logical to assume
that Pitt can make a serious run
at Villanova for the top spot in

»the East. ' . "

“Last year we could have won
the IC4A’s”, said Dorel Watley
last month, ,“but we lacked the
depth. This year, believe me,

  Is This
The Year?

I by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

JIM BANNER
“Wants To Win”

Since accepting the track and field coaching assignment in
July of 1966 Jim Banner has been the most successfulcoach on
the Pitt payroll. .but that all-important Eastern championship
has continued to elude his grasp.

Banner once again finds himself on the eve of the IC4As,
which is the strange name for the East’s big track meets. Ac-
tually the IC4As is the conference officially listed as the Inter-
Collegiate Amateur Athletic Association of America.

In the past, Banner’s team have had dreams of possible
IC4A titles. but none have materialized. The best a team could
do was a strong second place finish in last fall's cross country
run forit all. ‘ ’ ~

With the recent bit of history in mind, plus some very im-
pressive weekends during this winter’s indoor track season,
this looks like the year for Banner’s first IC4A championship.
His excellent group of athletes appears to be in the best form
ever. Last week at the Delaware Invitational they not only came
back with the world record in the distance medley relay, but
also four new team records and several places in the meet.

“I only hope we didn't leave it all behind last weekend."
Banner says, being very cautious. “Traditionally we've never

 
 
     

done well at the IC4As. I don’t know why. But I hope we break

the hex.“ —

I The coach is worrying about more than the hex. Teams like
Villanova. Maryland. Penn and Adelphi disturb his thoughts of
a team victory. -

You would think that ‘he also feels’ more pressure than us-
ual this year because it is the final season for the three big
names of Pitt track under Banner. Seniors Jerry Richey, Smit-
tie Brown and Bryant Salter cannot be relied upon after the
1971 competition.

Could this be the last chance for an Eastern title?

“No." Banner says. It's just going to be a matter of getting
used to new names after this year. I‘don‘t think we'll be as good

~ next year. It‘ll take a year to mature again, but you never know

in track. We have several guys on the verge of greatness."
‘T Dorel Watley, a junior who belongs in the class of Banner’s

I top seniors appears to be the heir apparent for the most success

next year, but there are other names to get used to who will cer-
tainly play a major role in any _championship effort that might
materialize this weekend. Names like Ted Bobby, Dave Chese-
borough, Dennis Schatzman, Ken Silay and Dave Szabat.

There are newer names. freshmen, who aren’t eligible in
this year's IC4As—Gary Risch. Ed Marstellar and Bill Rea. And
there are names yet to be heard. as Banner. a champion recruit.-
er. tells you f‘recruiting is the name of the game.

Jim Banner also says that you never know about track. So
it would be profitable if he could bring back that Eastern trophy
this year.

The “people who can do it"
will include All-American Jerry
Richey. who will run in the two-

ley team which set a world re-
cord last week in Delaware.

Bryant Salter. who was den-
ied an IC4A record last spring in
the Triple Jump when his toe
went three-quarters of an inch

. over the line. will try again this

year in- the triple jump as well
as in the High jump. Sa1ter‘s

» victorious ‘jump of 48 feet. 4 in-

ches last week at Delaware seems
to indicate that he is ready for
the big one. Last year Salter’s

disqualified jump was a 52 ft. /

effort. Salter incidentally, is the
only athlete in the East to ever
clear 50 ft. in the triple jump.

Dorel Watley, who finally
qualified for the Nationals last
week—and who is extremely con-
fident of Pitt’s chances at
Princeton—will run in the 440.

The world record holding dis-
tance Medley .team will not be
in tact this week because of
scheduling difficulties. Dennis
Schatzman wi1l.replace Smittie
Brown in the _Medley because
Brown will have to run, the 600
shortly afterwards.

Banner would rather use Brown
in the 600 than in the Medley
and is confident that Schatzman
will be a better than adequate
replacement. Brown has the dis-
tinction of having run the fast-
est 600 by an American colle-

gian so far this year. by the

way.

The biggest dissappointment
Banner will face is that he

The squad will consist of about
75 candidates, 21 of which are
lettermen. NCAA regulations
require that Pitt complete 20
practice sessions within 36 days.
The annual Blue-Gold game,
scheduled for April 3rd in the
Stadium, will end the Panthers
drills.

"I think this could be an ex-
citing spring practice." related
Coach Carl DePasqua. “We’re
going to experiment with a lot of
different formations in our of-
fense. I think we have the quar-
terbacks who can do it this
year, so we‘re going to go with
what our talent dictates."

cipate in spring drillsdue to in-

missed two shots, but Mike Heitz

was fouled. Heitz went to the
foul stripe and missed and the
ball rebounded into the hands of
Mountaineer high scorer Wil Ro-
binson. Robinson passed off to
Larry Harris under the hop and
Harris sank the deciding bucket.

“It was there for us to win,”
said Pitt Coach Buzz.Ridl after

the game. “We just didn’t grab

it. We lost it at the foul line.”

Ridl had some difficulty mak-
ing his way to the locker-room
after the disheartening contest.
West Virginia fans flooded the
court and began throwing paper
cups at the Pitt Coach. Panther
Freshman Coach Tim Grgurich
was also pinned on the court. and
neither Pitt mentor "could break
away until police freed them
from the crowds a few minute
later. ‘ ~

In a first half dominated by
the Mountaineers. the home
team still couldn’t build up en-
ough momentum to take a com-
manding lead. The Panthers kept
the game tight using their weav-
ing, deliberate offense. Moun-
taineer Coach Sonny Moran was
a little disturbed with the Panther
offense, slowing down his own
team’s scoring punch in the pro-
cess;

‘ “We can’t play that kind of,

basketball,” said Moran refering
to the calculated, deliberate at-
tack of the Panthers. “We can’t
handle the ball that well.

“We could have sat back in a
zone when we had our 5 point
lead. but we didn't."

Turnovers plagued both teams
in the first half, but the Panthers
wound up on the short end of a
35-29 tally. Early board domina-
tion by the Mountaineers allowed
West Virginia to convert a lot
of second and third attempts off
the offensive backboards. Pitt
came back in the second half
and finished with seven less re-
bounds than WVU. 57-50.

Matme11°Realistic’ At Eastern Meet .-

by MARK SIGMON

The Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Association (EIWA)
tournament begins today at the
U.S. Naval Academy, with Navy
and Penn State as the heavily fav-
ored teams to beat.

After finishing seventh in the
1970 Easterns. the Pitt matmen
figured on a first place finish this
year. But. riddled by injuries and
personal problems, all dreams of
an EIWA championship have fad-
ed away.

“Right now," remarked Assis-
tant Coach Dick Slutzky. “Coach

dents and $1 for non-students.
The rink is located on McKelvey

(Dave) Adams and I believe a
fifth place finish at Navy is a real-
istic goal to shoot for. If Gary
McClure, Dave Wylie (a fourth
place finisher at 134 in the 1970
Easternsl, Jim Fleming and Bob
Kuhn all do their best, they should
all place. since these four men
will probably be seeded.

“Had it not been for the plague
of injuries and other individual
problems, our squad would def-
initely have been the 1971 EIWA
champs and ended the dual meet
season undefeated. In fact, we
could have placed in the top four
in the NCAA tourney, and given
any wrestling team in the country
a real dogfight.”

There will be four Panthers in
the lineup for the Easterns who
didn’t step on the mat against
Penn State. Captain Bob Kuhn,
out of action for a month with a
shoulder dislocation, will partici-
pate at 167 pounds. However,
Kuhn, third place’ finisher at 158
in the 1970 Easterns, may go

nament at Princeton.

150 this weekend. Since Chatman
s a freshman. he is not eligible to
compete in the Easterns. But
“Bimbo" will enter the regional
tourney next week.

Having beaten Rich Cross in
tryouts this week in practice, John
Buzatto earned the right to
wrestle at 142 at Annapolis. La-
mar Hudson will occupy the 190-
pound slot, with Fred Weber mov-
ing up to the heavyweight.

Although the grapplers are
sending a full team to the East-
erns, only certain ones will com-
pete at Princeton, March 12 and
13. The individual performances
of each matman at Navy will par-
tially determine which contes-
tants enter the Regionals.

Having compiled an 8-3-1 rec-
ord this season, the Pitt grapplers
attained a mark about equal to
last year’s 10-4 squad. And es-
pite losing the services of 11
wrestlers at one time or another,
the Panther matmen still have a
shot at making a respectable
showing in the EIWA tournament.

“Wrestling is an egotistical
sport,” explained Slutzky. “In
tournaments, you cannot be af-
fected if a teammate loses. You’ve
got to concentrate on winning your
own match and take them one at
a time.

“Normally, the Easterns are
the high point of the season. This
tourney requires a full effort; the
individual effort of each wrestler
affects the motivation of all his
teammates. However, because of
the rash of untimely
we’ve suffered, I feel our per-
formance will manifest more of
an individual effort than the usual
team effort.”

Switching to the subject of con-
ditioning, Slutzky said, “We are
in very good shape at the mo-
ment. Conditioning is extremely
important in tournaments. This
is one of the reasons why I think
Navy will win the championship
over Penn State.

NCAA Qualiﬁers E5

In an attempt to narrow the
field of competition in the national
wrestling tournament, the NCAA
has instituted a new qualifying
procedure which will rob the
Easterns to qualify for the Na-
tionals. As a result the Nationals
became rather cumbersome.

“The Nationals were becoming
more a test of endurance than of
wrestling ability,” stated Pitt
Coach Dave Adams.

The new qualifying system de-
mands that a wrestler place in
the top five positions in the Dis-
trict 2 regional qualifying tourna-
ment, the one Pitt competes in.

Adams is reserving judgement
on the new system until after he
sees it in practice. «

His only objection so far is that
the qualifiers are only a week af-
ter the Easterns. A break of a
week or two in between would be
better, according to the coach.

(Editor's Note: The following article was written
by ex Pitt News sportswriter after his return from U.S.
Army Reserves.)

by BILL NAAB

My world tumbled. The transition could almost
be called scary. I was plucked from the pleasant
surroundings of the University of Pittsburgh sports
scene and tossed into that immense green machine
—the United States Army.

On that first day (September 22, 1970) at
the Fort Knox, Ky.. reception center everything

_ seemed like a dream. It wasn't exactly the type of

dream one would substitute in place of counting

fxsheep in order to fall asleep. Thoughts perpetually

wandered into my mind. What was I doing yester-
day at this time? A week ago?

Yesterday I was sitting in the Pitt News office
writing a feature on Joe Carroll. Only a few days
had passed since that
long-awaited UCLA
grid-iron clash. Ex-
actly one week ago,
Sports Editor Ed Con-
ley and 1 represented
Pitt at the fall’s first
football luncheon at
the Cathedral of
Learning’s Babock
Room. My spirit had
been ignited for the
coming football sea-
son.

Sept. 23, however,
instantly changed the
significance of every-
thing that I had ever known. Pitt Panther varsity
football, Pitt News Associate Sports Editor meant
nothing. Being Private Naab, yelling “left, right,
left,” and obediently muttering “yes sir” now
snatched prime relevance.

Despite how impossible the change into mili-
tary life seemed, I didn't completely lose contact
with Pitt sports. A weekly phone call to the Pitt
News alleviated my sports anxiety.

PV-I BILL NAAB

Meanwhile. I had struck it rich. No. I didn't dis-
cover a secret passage to the Fort Knox gold vault.
However. I was fortunate enough to be a member
of Drill Sergeant Claycomb’s fourth platoon.

I shudder to think what my state of mind might
have been under the leadership of one of the other
Dls (Drill Instructors). I must have spent more

. time discussing sports with Sgt. Claycomb than I did
learning hand-to-hand combat and bayonet training
combined.

My DI gladly permitted me to phone Pitt weekly
and in fact -compared his college football selections
to my Yogi picks following each weekend.

He like many other college football fans, be-
..:ved that the Panthers still inhabited the bottom

of the collegiate gridiron world. Needless to'say.
the Panthers 5-1 recordand number 15 national
ranking at the end of October astounded him.

Many guys in my barracks had lived in Minneso-
ta and were aware of only the Big Ten and the peren-
nial powers’ colege football programs. However,
after the season’s initial six weeks, everyone in the
fourth platoon had learned something about Pan-
ther football.

Following basic training, I visited the Universi-
ty of Louisville, Western Kentucky University and
the University of Kentucky. Pitt‘s past athletic de-
pression, coupled with its absence from the televi-
sion screen and the national football and basketball
ratings apparently had taken their toll.

Only a few transplanted Ohioans at Louisville
University seemed familiar with Pitt sports. They
realized that the Panthers were in the process of

rising from the dead. One guy, a football player,

had received a letter from the Panther coaching
staff a few years ago in high school.

The names Cindrich and Weston, meanwhile,
weren’t on the tip of every fan's tongue. Instead,
the name of John Madeira gained a hero-worship-
ers’ respect in Kentucky’ Madeira is a quarterback

from West Mifflin who led Louisville to a Bowl game.

One week after my visit to the University of -

Louisville, I could obtain a standing room only tick-
et in Lexington for the Kentucky-Vanderbilt basket-
ball battle‘. Even the students lined up on the street
one and half-hours before game time in order to pro-
cure a seat in the 13,000 seat colesium.

High school football recruits from New Castle
(four) and Etna (one) in addition to a Mt. Lebanon
basketball star were introduced under the spotlight
between halvesof the game.

My screaming plea, “Go to Pitt!” drew enough
violent stares to make me shrink out of sight.

The, back in the antiquated wood barracks at
Fort Knox. Pitt still didn‘t seem far away. Pictures
of the Cathedral and the University campus (from

L the Jan. 2 Pitt-Rutgers basketball program) were .

taped on the inside of my locker door.

Things gradually were being pieced back togeth-
er into prospective.

P|TT’s baseball team, under the coaching of Bob
Lewis, began spring indoor practice on Monday.

Lewis is looking for an equipment manager
for the team. Anyone interested in the position
may contact him at his office at Trees Hall,
ext. 66236.

Fraternity

Wrestling Tournament

by MARK SIGMON

With four returning B League fraternity champs, Phi Gamma Del-
ta leads the annual IFC intramural wrestling tournament going into last

night’s quarter—final round.

The Fijis (Phi Gamma Delta) are in first place with 17 points. Phi
Kappa Theta only trails by five. while Kappa Sigma and Delta Tau Delta
have 11 points apiece. Sigma Chi and Delta Sigma Phi round out the top

six teams with ten points each.

After the first two preliminary
rounds. only three wrestlers have
pinned both their opponents. They
include defending A-league champ
Paul Harkins (160 lbs., Delta Tau
Delta). defending B league champ
Jim Lombardi (130 lbs., Kappa
Sigma), and Phil Kap's 150 pound-
er Doug Hoehm.

Harkin’s fall, which only took 11
seconds is the fastest pin in intra-
mural history.

Tuesday evenings first round
saw wrestling competition at
120 thru 150 lbs. Kappa Sig’s John
Laptosky and Lombardi, 1970 B-
league champs won both of their
matches.

Al Benaglio will pole vault

John Black are listed in the mile.

“I’m always dissappointed
when we don’t come out on top”,
commented Banner. “The whole
team feels this way. But we are
in excellent physical condition
and even though we will face
the best competition we will
have faced all year, we do have
a lot of quality athletes-—even
if we don’t have the depth in
quantity.

“Mentally, I just hope, we
didn't leave everything down
in Delaware last week“.

Banner would make no pre-
dictions, however.

“Let‘s wait until the meet is
over. I‘m looking at it as just
another weekend“. he said. “But
if we get a second or third place
we‘ll have to accept it. First
place is what we want. "

Trailing the Kappa Sigs by two
points after Tuesday night's open-
ing round, the Fiji's rocketed into
the team lead on Wednesday with
five pins and two decisions.

Fiji‘s Jim Ayres (170) and Bob
Thompson (180), both 1970 all-
campus champions, put away
their opponents in the first per-
iods. Vince Corsi, another Fiji all
campus champ in 1970, pounded
out a 7-1 decision over his
opponent.

The Phi Kaps added seven
points in Wednesday’s night ac-
tion. Tim Generalovich. 1970 A-
league champ at 170 lbs.. dropped
down to 160 lbs. and got a second
period fall.

Hurt by the unexplained ab-
sence of three defening A-league
champs, Sigma Chi still managed
to score six points on Wednes-
day night. Jim Parros, the 1970,
180 lbs. winner, accounted for
two of the six points with a first
period fall over Fiji Bill Mama-
kos.

Theta Chi, after scoring five
points on Tuesday. only added
three more on Wednesday. Ed
Kondrat, defending champ at 150
lbs., had a pin and a decision to
his credit in the first two rounds.

Going into last night‘s quarter
final round Phi Gamma Delta had
11 grapplers remaining. The Phi
Kaps have eight men left while
Delta Tau Delta has seven. With
five men each are Sigma Chi. Del-
