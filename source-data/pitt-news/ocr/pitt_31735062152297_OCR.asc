Break Ground
For New Pitt
Medical Units

Construction Program
Begun Here by Two-
City Hospitals

A shiny steel spade cut into the
turf yesterday morning and a $2,-
500,000 construction program, which
will see the addition of two more
units to the University medical cen-
ter, was under way.

Before a group of University of-
ficials, including Chancellor John G.
Bowman, city officials, and promi-
nent medical directors, ground was
broken for the new Eye and Ear
hospital and Presbyterian hospital,
which"‘will add to the_medical cen-
ter already started with the Chil-
dren's hospital and the University
Folk Clinic.

As now planned, the Eye and Ear
hospital will comprise one wing, 10
stories, high, of the main structure
housin the Presbyterian. The es-
timated cost of construction for both
was set at $2,500,000 by John E.
Crawford, chairman of the Eye and
Ear Hospital committee, and J. Mc-
Duncan, chairman of the Presbyte-
rian building committee.

With the construction of these
two units, Dean R. R. I-Iu gins, of
the University medical sc col, be-
lieves work soon can start on the
new medical school itself.

Dean Huggins Comments L

In a statement to the Weekly,
Dean Huggins said, “The University
medical center, an accomplishment.
lon dreamed of, is becoming an ac-

tua ity ‘with the announcement that.

the Eye and Ear and Presbyterian
hospitals would build on school prop-

ert . V

“)With the addition of these two
institutions, Pittsburgh will have 9.
medical center, distinctive from any
in the country. It means that the
University, through its affiliations
with the hospitals, will be able to
produce better physicians, and ad-
vances in medical science will _be
forthcoming with greater rapidity.

Club to Elect New President
To Fill Homer Vacancy

I

The Undergraduate Cap and
Gown Club has almost completed
plans for the purchase of a new
drop curtain. At. its last Monday
meeting, the club inspected samples
of material and made a. tentative
choice of a glossy blue satin.

Plans for the. decorating of the
curtain were furthered when the
club considered ve ‘seriously a

romising offer whic William F.
hfarlatt, director of last year's
show, received from a prominent
New York artist. The curtain will
be of the type that opens in the cen-
ter and draws to the sides. Tenta-
tive decorative plans call for a blue
background and gold border, with
the niversity seal in the center of
one section, and a reproduction of
tltile Cap and Gown Club on the
0 er.

Due to the resignation of Stuart H

Horner, Dent. '31, a. vacancy now
exists in the club’s residenc . Un-
til this vacancy is lled at t e next
meeting, Sunday, October 12, at the
Phi Kappa house, John St. Peter,
Col. ‘31, vice president, is assuming
charge of the club’s business.

The program for the club's V881‘
was planned on Wednesday, Octo-
ber 1, when the officers met in
Zoology Main. The problem of the
field trips was discussed and tempo-
rary plans were formulated. The
club is planning to invite persons
intereste in biology and zoology to
speak at the different meetings of
the year.

Leonard Williams, chairman of
the Field Trip committee, has been
planning the first ﬁeld trip of the
season to Cook’s Forest. The trip

date has been tentatively set as Oc-
tober the twenty-ﬁfth.

President Charles Edwards, Dent.
‘.31, called for general discussion
»concerning the method of choice of
chairmen. Following the abolish-

miint of class officers, last Spring,

Student Council found themselves at

aL;.loss« when confronted, early this

fall, with the problem of choosing

a -chairman for the Sophomore Hop.

.L At’, a special meeting called last

‘ _ , se, they discovered that it would

 es .  pghns for the future.

a L ‘Following a general discussion of

o  the plan dpropos-ed by Walter J.
  Rome, gra uate manager of student
activities that “persons desiring

‘ such chairmanships must petition

, . Council similarly as was done for
ll-‘lf0!'m&l P1'°8T3m3 F°.3t“"°L nqinination to class officer,” Charles

’ . .1~'I'h_e motion as passed read,

?‘ “_ _Ltudents desiring dance chairman-

giltips must use a form of petition,

iqﬁntical with that used for class

officers, to Student Council, in the

absence of any form of class gov-

 , nt. Student Council shall
vote for the chairmanships from
these petitions. All petitions must
be in the hands of Council at a

 ‘ L ., . ..  ... .. .. ,. ... i ,,.... ,

In order that no adverse comment
on that body he aroused this seem-
ii_ig usurption of power, Council de-
sires tomake it clear that -no stu-
dent will be considered who does not
submit a petition. “There will be
no exceptions,” stated President Ed-
wards. The plan, however, is only
temporary. in the sense that it will
immediately be abandon-ed and a re-
version made toward the older
scheme, upon the least suspicion of
failure.

L To Conduct Forums

. During the earlier half of the ses-
sion, Naomi Erickson, Col. ’31, sug-
gested to Council that they sponsor
a form. of conference or forum at
which a cross-section of the Uni-
versity student body might air its
views upon deﬁnite phases of extra-
curricular activities at Pitt.

As passed -by Council, the motion
read_ that “At the next regular
meeting of Student Council, imme-
diately following the business, an
orpen forum shall be held to discuss
‘ Lo Pitt Students Want Student
Government.’ This discussion’ will
be open to ‘all Faculty members and
students. The president shall ap-

oint’ a committee of three who will

' responsible for the success of the
forum. A leader shall be chosen.”

The topic “Do Pitt Students Want
Student Government” was suggested
by Dean Thyrsa Amos who believed

that such a subject would be of in-

threat to the entire student body
and should be a drawing card.

The committee. as appointed by
President Edwards consists of
Naomi Erickson, Col. ’31, chairman;
Adelaide Hunter, Col. ’32, and
Charles Seidle, Col. ‘31.

Preceding the business meeting,
Student Council -held the usual in-
formal dinner. At the end of the
dinner there was a short social time
at which the newer members were
made acquainted with each other as
well as with the older Councilors,

By Roy Magram '

From far and near and wide. rep-
resentatives from quite every sec-
tion of the globe have gathered here
at this grand convention of students
-—all in quest of a college degree.
One strange, young delegate stands
out among them all

She comes and goes as quietly as
a mouse, unobserved and unnoticed,
in this conglomerated mass of some
twelve thousand students of every
conceivable nation. A reticent, mod-
est young lass whose people "once
inhabited that fascinating expanse
of country in the Far East-China.
All the glamour of the Orient is in
the two, ebony, radiant eyes that
sparkle in her olive complexioned
face. She is a very, very young
lady with smooth black hair that
she wears plastered closely to her
head.‘ At quick glance she is but
one of hundreds, a modern girl
garbed in the fashion of the day:
white hose and shoes, and a white
sport suit with ﬂowered coat-jacket.
Observe her a moment longer and
you'll notice a curious silent. about
her eyes, the only distinguishing
feature about her. That’: Miss Ro-
salie Yee Quil who holds the dis-
tinction of being the only Chinese
coed registered as an undergradu-
ate at the University.

Studious and Athletic

For the moment Rosalie appears
an assiduous student, forever en-
grossed in books, with no concern
about the active worldsurroundizig
her. But the heavy shell-rimmed
glasses she wears and the large

lack brief case she carries are apt
to be misleading. Really,she’s not
thatat all. Rather she admits that
she is fond of sports, and modestly
declares that she swims .“a little,
but not very well,” and swings a
racket.

As Miss Quil explains, with a
charming smile that reveals a flaw-
less set of white teeth, it is only
good fortune that brings’ her here.
While still in high school, she
hadn’t the remotest conception that
she might sometime continue’ her
education. But last June when_235
students were being graduated from
the Wilkinsburg igh school, the
conscientious Chinese girl who sat
among them was to receive what
she duly merited. By virtue of the
“excellent scholastic record she had
attained, Rosalie was awarded high-
est honors and a scholarship to the
University of Pittsburgh.

That brings Rosalie among us.
At present she is enrolled in the
college as an English major. She
hopes that she may teach that "sub-
ject ‘in our own» schools ‘sometime.

Break Ground
For Hospitals

(Continued from Page One)

Construction of a $2,000,000 medical
school, itself, appears to be ‘much
closer as the result\of the erection
of the Eye and -Ear and the Pres-,
byterian ospital units.”

All the funds for the Eye and Ear
unit have been subscribed and most,
of the‘ Presbyterian Hospital’s share‘
was raised in a drive ﬁve years ago.;54

_In its wing, the Eye and Ear Hos-
pital will have a capacity of more
than _100 beds. The main part of the
building where the Presbyterian
unit will be located, will contain
more than 200 beds. Building plans‘
are prepared so that three other
Wiriigsto be devoted to specialties of
me icine similar to Eye and Ear,_
can _be added later, giving ‘a total
housing capacity ‘of 700 patients and
spensary_ facilities to care for
100,000 visits a year. '

-Rush Other Units’ Plans

Other units in the Medical Center
also are rushing plans. A laboratory

 

 

school with the hospital group is as-
sured throughthe $500,000 gift of
Dr. and Mrs. Ogden M. Edwards,
made in January, 1929.

With’ the _University’s affiliations
of the Tuberculosis. and Magee Hos-
pitals which are located nearby,the

that Pittsburgh will have a medical

Of $14,500,000 at least and on a par
with any in the country.

The position of the Edwards’ Lab-A
oratories, which will probably be the
next step in construction of the Med-
1°31_Cent9_1‘. will be that of a con-
necting link between the general
hospital unit of the center and the
medical school, _bringing laboratory
and medical sciences into such 1;
close relation as to give Pitt unique
position in the.medical ﬁeld and to
create a teaching plant, second to

As a Pocket Pen

Getting the Parker Duofold is now
like getting two Pens at the price of one.
Attaching a tapered end converts it into
a Desk Set Pen. Removing the taper
 it to a pocket Pen.

Either way, you save the price of a
second pen. You have only one Pen to
fill instead of two. And, whether you
write at your desk or on the go. You
always have your favorite point.

committee will welcome the new
Jewish students of Pitt, "Pennsylva-

Gallery of Student Photos

For over four years fresh-
men have been caught while
suﬁering from “registration
daze" and led up to the camera,
so that administration offices
now have on file a. picture of
every student in school.

These photos are pasted on
cards and furnish entertainment
in spare moments for girls in
six diﬁcrent oﬂices: the dean
of the school the dean of men
or women, the student health
service, the personal records of-

Need For Teachers
Decreases At Pitt

A slight decrease in the number
of calls for teachers has been no-
ticed by the Teachers’ Placement
Bureau of the School of Education
during the past year.

Regarding the number of place-
ments made by the bureau in re-
cent years, Mrs. Ethel Fennell Holt,
director of the bureau. said, “The

comparative study of the report of
the teachers’ appointment bureau
for the last ﬁve years revealed the
fact that the years, 1928 and 1929,
were the record years,’ if the num-
ber of calls for teachers and rela-

tive number of placements are in-
dicative.”

Fred Turbyville, stadium publicity director, who was ap-

pointed to succeed Don Saunders during the past summer, is
one of the best known public relations men connected with

sports in the country.

For fully ﬁfteen years since his high school days, Turby-
yille has been engaged in some sort of newspaper work. In his

senior year in high school, he cov-~‘->

cred _news stories, having nothing -to
doﬂvith the sports staff.

they are still talking about Fred
and his football exploits. Here, he
first met W. J. Connoly who played
football at Earlham for two years
and who later starred at a halfback
post for the Pitt Panthers. Connoly

at the present time is an attorney- ‘

‘at-law in downtown Pittsburgh.

 

 
 

 From Earlham, Turbyville went
to Cleveland“ where he became 3.
;ports writer for the Cleveland
ews.
,Later, he returned to Indiana,
where he took over the role of
§ports editor of the Indianapolis
tar. Afterwards he was s orts

Profs Find Another. Reason
For Locked Ballot Boxes ;
Drop I 1: Absence Slips

Just to enlighten the ‘cam-

pus, and to put a stop to all
the stamped letters and votes
for the Owl beauty contest
winner that Bill DauEen-
b.augh’s found--tliose boxes
with the. strong. -brass locks
that stand in the halls belong
to the new system of checking
on absences. -
After every class the in-
structor ﬁlls out a white ab-
sence slip, long enough to get
every name missing when the
roll is called, unless a frater-
nity brother answers for you.
Before he has a chance to lose
the slip, he drops it in the box,
where they are all collected at
the end of the -day.

The boxes are too heavy to
carry away, and the locks are
too strong to break, so there's
nothing left to do but go to
class occasionally.

Large Group

Physical Education D e p t .
Plans Miniature Golf

 

According to Mr. Dambach, head
of the Department of physical edu-
cation, the enrollment in his depart-
ment is one of the largest in the
history of Pitt.

Because of the inadequate space
in the Trees Gym, the department
is using both the Stadium and track
houses. Classes in Gym and Pool
are being conducted all day during
the entire week.

In the men’s divisioié, Ray Mont-
gomery, a member of he 1929 Pitt
football team, has been added as
part time instructor. Dr. Ellis
Frost, medical advisor, also has
been added as lecturer in Diagnosis.

In the women's division, Miss
Elizabeth White of Columbia Uni-
versity and Mrs. Francis Rohm
Tracy, wife of Mr. Tracy of the en-
gineering department, have replaced
Miss Aubeck and Miss Jameson, re-
spectively, as instructors.

Miniature Golf On

During‘ the school year the Uni-
versity will attempt to maintain a
miniature golf tourse. as well as a
driving range. Every student in the
University will have an opportunity
to participate in inter-fraternity or
intra-mural competition. Other new
sports that will be attempted, are
tumbling, apparatus work, mush-
ball and volleyball. Horseshoe
Eitching, basketball, wrestling and

citing, which were s orts on last
year's program, will a so be on the
program. ‘

Faculty members will have the
double opportunity of using both
the gym and pool every Monday
night. Swimming instruction will
be given by Mr. Dambach, while the
gym will be in charge of Mr. Potts.
Tap dancing will be taught to the
women members of the faculty by
Mrs. Tracy.

Any fraternities, sororities or
other students interested in any of
the activities of the physical edu-
cation department should see either
Miss McClenahan or Mr. Dambach.

Ithe test of a student vote became increasingly evident last
 when Student Council was compelled to meet in a special
‘ session for the purpose of selecting the chairman of the Sopho-

*'  This unusual procedure was a result of the provision in’
 tentative constitution whereby class offices are to be elimi-
tcd.-. Election of class heads was postponed at the general

 that none of the classesare organized this fall.
 ‘- f f'I‘_here was no particular objection to Council selecting the
 chairman- The governing body did as good a job as any,

By SARAHDRUM

Panhellenic Association welcomes the freshmen to the campus,
It urges them to use this first semester for the purpose for which it
was intended-—that of making real friends. _

The beginning of the school year is an especially friendly time,
and we want you to feel at home and to find congenial friends.

But friendship is a slow growth. It does not blossom overnight.
Acquaintance may be achieved after a few meetings and a brief ex-
change of small talk. On the other hand, friendship cannot be de-
veloped quickly, but must come leisurely, from natural association.

Panhellenic stands for friendship. In fact its existence depends
upon the friendly feeling which prompts women to form fraternities.
But it is not exclusive. It believes that therecan be real friendship
women and non-fraternity women, between

while you are making friends, you should not neglect to
cultivate friendships within your own class, the women you will know
best in your four years at Pitt. If these class friendships come first,
the other will follow naturally from your campus contacts. .

Waynesburg came, saw and were
conquered, bruised and bent to the
aria of 52-0. General Grant's im-
mortal words we suggest as a motto
for the Pitt team, “We shall hold it
out on this line if it takes all sum-
mer.”

._.o_._.

The score of the game brings to
mind our own Miniature Golf record;
52 strokes on the credit sheet and 0
on the debit. Of course we never
disclose our Golf scores without
humming that popular chant, “Those
Little White Lies,” the new Golf
theme song.

On the ﬁeld the Band emanated
sartorial perfection in their new
blue uniforms. Like free lunches
and war savings stamps, the capes
and spats have gone but the cockade
persists. The new cockade delight-
ing the chapeau is tinted like
Orange Rouge. It has many uses
however, weather vane or whether
vain. Marooned on a desert isle
we can think of apno more" effective
toothbrush, or on a. demeure date it
can be used eificaciously as a chin
tickler. The latter method stimu-
lates fellowship and utilizes many
an otherwise wasted moment.

Classes are presenting a formid-
able obstacle in our path to success.
If it weren't for classes college
would be an ideal place. A certain
prof whom I will call Jones because
his real name is Smith, and I do

not wish to reveal his identity for
political reasons, is continually rid-
mg us for not preparing our les-
sons. And truth being one of our
vices, when he demands, “Mr. Wes-
lager, have you prepared the les-
son for today?“ we are forced to
reply, “No.” However this tram-
meling fetter, has now been loos-
ened. The first thing we do when
we arrive home is to lay out all our
books in a, row on the ﬂoor and
take a running jump over them and
back again. So now when Mr. Jones
(Smith) says, “And have you read
the material in the text,” we reply
truthfully, “Yes sir, I went over it
twice.”

There are fourteen grave mistakes
in the following sentence‘; can you

The following badinage ensued in
a. city school:

The teacher was telling the fourth
grade the story of Treasure Island.
“And so Long John found two treas-
ure chests. He opened the ﬁrst and
found a loot of diamonds and ancient
silver. In the secondhe discovered
great heaps of old gold. Now chil-
dren what do you think the inscrip-
tion read on the second chest'.”’

Voice piping from rear: Not a

And what a greatcalamity if one
of_ the 20,679 physicians who say a
so and so cigarette is less irritat-
ing would smokea “not a cough in
a carload” and recind "his state-

ment. Hundreds of artists would,

have to work overtime, millions of
dollars would have to be expended
to change the 20,679 to 20,678. What

CAMPUS SCOUT

Pitt’s varsity football team will win its second game of the

'"season tomorrow afternoon at Morgantown if the calculations

=*of the Campus Scout are correct.
Despite the fact that the Mountaineers have been impres-

 sive in their ﬁrst two starts against Duquesne and West Vir-
.;ginia Wesleyan, your scout does not think that the Moun-
Jtaineers are quite strong enough to cope on even terms with a

-team having the power that this year’s Panthers possess.

The Mountaineer team this year is composed for the

greater part of sophomores and these youngsters have showed
such promise that most sports writers who have watched them
at their fall training quarters predict a great team for the West
Virginia school for the next three years.

' "There is but one ﬂa.w in the ointment as far as the hopes
of these sophomores are concerned against the Panthers to-
morrow. This ﬂaw is the fact that these sophomores’ lost one

.— game last year when playing on the Mountaineer ﬁrst-year team

»;_and that game was lost to the Pitt freshmen.

off with straight line thrusts by the fullback and w en the Mountaineer
"ends are brought in to help the weak center of the line, Eddie Baker will
send his halfbacks around the ends.

The Pitt boys, following your scout’s strate , will toss an occasional
pass and the Mountaineers’ secondary defense will be so concentrated on
stopping the assaults on their line that the famed West Virginia pass
defense which stopped Duquesne’s vaunted. attack so easily will find it
hard to break down the tosses of the Pitt men. '

that they are worthy of the uni.

these lads will look wel in varsity

Matteseck is an accurate passing

look _good are: Tierman, guard;
Timmins, lanky end; Siebert, a fast
half-back and Hassan, a, heavy line-
man.

Squad is Heavy

These boys got oil’ to a late start
because they did _not attend foot-
ball camp, but their inexperiencg of
Pitt tactics is no great handicap.

The squad as a whole is a heavy
bunch, but it would be greatly
strengthened by some of the dink-
wearing six-footers lately seen on
the tennis courts.

If the Plebes want a winning team
they should not concentrate so much
on some minor sport. An Frosh
who has ever played footbsl should
be up_there on the hill after classes,
plugging away for a berth on the

Mountaineers Seek Revenge
For “Freezing” Incident

 

 

A little incident which occurred
at a. basketball game on March 8
may make the Pitt-West Virginia
football same tomorrow. one of the
hardest fought battles of the year.

The basketball game in question
was that between the two schools
which saw Pitt freeze the ball al-
most the entire second half when

they found that they could not_

pierce the strong Mountaineer zone
defense. The ﬁnal score of that
battle was 21-19 after the first half
‘ When the teams met later in the
season at Morgantown, the aroused
Mountaineers countered by freezing
the ball once they had gained the
lead, and ﬁnally defeated the Pan-
thers 88-25, in one of the two times
that Coach Carlson's boys felt the
sting of defeat during the season.

’ Incident Reviewed

The Mountaineers have never for-
gotten that freezing incident and
throughout fall training sessions,
Coach Ira Rodgers of the Moun-
taineer football team has employed
that basketball incident in his psy-
chology to work his boys into a
ﬁghting pitch for the Pitt encounter.

In addition, three of the ﬁve men
who started for the West Virginia
cagers on that eventful day will
start for the Mountaineers; tomor-
row when they line up against the
Panthers. These three men are
Eddie Bartrug, Johnny Doyle and
Lawrence Plaster.

These boys will help buoy up the
spirits of their fellow players in
their efforts to atone for their cage
defeat on the stadium court.

Opener, 52-0!

Panthers Show Strength In
Initial Skirmish

Pitt opened its 1930 grid season
last Saturday by ‘overwhelming a
hapless Waynesburg team at. the
stadium by a 52-0 score.

The game proved little more than
a workout" for the strong Panther
team, Pitt scoring eight touchdowns
and twenty-four ﬁrst
the Yellowjackets contented them-
selves with one first down. scored
overthe aerial route.

Two sophomores, "“_Buzz" Brown
and Zola Alpert, furmshed the big
thrills for the crowd in the closing
minutes of play. Brown made the
longest run of the da in the fourth
quarter when he gal oped .66 yards
behind perfect interference for a
touchdown, while Alpert carried a
punt back 45 yards for a touchdown
on the second play following the en-
suing kick-off. -

Jim MacMurdo, recently shifted
from a tackle to an end berth, gave
a good account of himself as did
Warren Heller, sophomore sensa-
tion, who is taking over “Toby"
Usnsa’s ‘old berth. All the other
Pitt men gave good accounts of
themselves, giving Pitt hopes for
another great year on the gridiron.

Panthers, Mountaineers
Meet At Morgantown

Pitt's varsity grid men will engage in their ﬁrst major tilt

of the season tomorrow afternoon when they encounter the
West Virginia Mountaineers at Morgantown in the twenty-sec-E

ond meeting of the football representatives of the two insti-

tutions.

A capacity crowd of 33,000 people, the first to ever enter
the West Virginia stadium since itsv .

completion four years ago, is ex-
pected to greet the players as they
take the field for battle.

‘game is expected to be one
of the closest games ever played be-
tween the two schools as the. Moun-
taineers have a team reputed to be
the best at that school in the past
decade, while the ' Panthers have
their usual 'strong aggregation.

Dotson Star
The. Mountaineers will depend
mainly upon their aerial attack and
the line plunging of Leo Dotson to
carry’ them to victory. These were
the main factors in the Moun-

’ tainoers’ two previous victories this

year over Duquesne University and
West Virginia Wesleyan, two of the
strongest teams in Class B circles
in the"'tri-state district.

» The .Mountaineei'.s are unusually
well fortiﬁed at the end berths and
as Bitt depends on long wide end
runs to gain much of their yardage,‘
the Mountaineers have high hopes

of cutting down the amount of yard- .

age Pitt is accustomed to sin
around their 0 ponents"termina s.

' The Mounts neers also showed in
the Duquesne game that they are
well able. to halt an -opponent's
aerial attack and the Pitt passing
attack » which functioned so cred-
itably. in the Waynesburg game may
be totally stopped tomorrow after-
noon.

form they displayed in their ‘opener
last Saturday, are conﬁdent of tak-
ing the '
couple of touchdowns. ' '

The Pitt defense this year islupl

to_ its usual high standard and the
Pitt linemen feel capable of halting
the thrusts of Leo 0’
Mountaineer fullback, inasmuch i‘ as
Waynesburg was unable to c pens-
trate the Pitt line for" a single ﬁrst
down, ‘ . ; .. ‘

The only phase of the game in
which the Pitt brigade is of ‘uncer-
tain quantity is. in their defense

against forward passes, the -Ws.ynes-

burg passing attack being-of hardly
sufficient strength to test. the
there in this department.

* _ Clark Back 
Pitt_ will present astronger fron
at this game than they , did lat
week as Jimmy Clark, the/only let-
tei-man at the fullback post.‘ will-be
in uniform again, he being out of
the lineup last week due toillnsss.

Clark may not start the-game for

the Panthers but he is certain of.»
getting in before the ﬁnal whistle-

and he will‘ make his presence‘ felt.
«At the time that this story was

written, Coach Jock Sutherland .ot,'
the Panthers was..undeeided_ as ‘to.

his starting lineup but it is prob.-

able that -the same lineup which

The Pittsburgh Athletic Council has
asked for 2,000 tickets for the
alumni and other regular patrons

500 From Uniontown

From Uniontown, where 500 tick-
ets were put on sale and all through
western Pennsylvania, outside of
Pittsburgh, there are large groups
of Pitt followers who are planning
the trek to Morgantown.-The post
office at Morgantown has been
ﬂooded with mail order applications
for tomorrow’s game, some coming
from as far as Texas. _,
The record for Mountaineer Field

is 21,000, being established by W. ’

& J. on Thanksgiving Day 1925. It
is clear. however, that the Moun-

gether with the fact that a Pitt
eleven has not visited Morgantown

for 13 years combines to make to- .

moi-row’s event the biggest attrac-
tion that has ever been on West
Virginia football programs.

City officials of Morgantown and
West Virginia University authori-
ties have been planning for weeks
to make tomorrow’s game one of
the ‘most colorful events in football
annals. Governor W. G. Conley, a
"Mountaineer” of the class of 1893,
will have a formal box to which he
hasinvited a number of dignitaries,
including. Governor John S. Fisher
of Pennsylvania.

ers history, an ambitious program
has been planned for the year.
Under the supervision of Carl Cass
who has had experience in acting,

will be the basis of productions this
year, according to Cass.

Cass has planned a series of one-
act plays to be under the sub-direc-
tion of ‘the students in his classes.
These plays will be the basis for. the
choosing of the casts for the two
major productions to be given dur-
ing the semester. “Twelfth Night”

and Yuletide "productions promise

special interest to the University.

application cards were filled out by

outs would be held later, and play-
ers would be" chosen ‘according to
