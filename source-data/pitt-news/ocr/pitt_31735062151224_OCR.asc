Family Campaign

 

The Family-Help-Family Relief
Campaign has been extended _to the
Pitt campus with the announce-
ment this week that students will
be asked to contribute to the drive
to obtain funds for Allegheny
County's needy families.

systematic
canvassing of students and fra-
ternity houses will be conducted,
but a general appeal will be voiced
to the student body to help in the
campaign which is nearing its
closing days.

In a statement made this week,
Hunt said that the committee rec-
ognized the fact that many stu-
dents lived outside of Allegheny
County and that the families of
other students had already been
solicited, but the committee hoped

that campus organizations and
fraternity groups might help in
the drive for funds.

ute to the Family-Help-Family

Jarvis To Head College
Association; Light
Vote Tabulated

 

A new “low" in voting irregulari-
ties was reached Monday with the
unprotected election of six Student
Council representatives and officers
of the College Association for the
coming year.

Monday's election, held only for
students in the College and the
Schools of Business Administra-
tion, Engineering and Mines after
fraudulent voting in these schools
had caused a previous election on
April 29 to be thrown out by the
office of the Dean of Men, was de-
clared free of fraud and its results
were accepted as final by polling
oflicials.

Oﬂicers for the College Associa-
tion, elected Monday, are Robert
Jarvis, ’33, president; Benjamin
Weissman, ’33, vice president;,Jo-
seph,A. Novak, ’35, secretary, and
Jack Hunger, ’34, treasurer.

Candidates who were successful
in the race for senior membership
on Student Council include Albert
Stammelbach, Bus. Ad., and Ed-
mund Breene, Jr., Mines. Other
senior members for next year are
Paul Best, Col., and Franklin Kall-
felz, Eng., who were elected inter-
nally by Council several weeks ago,
and Reed Rose, Dent., and Dorothy
Lee, Ed., whose election was un-
protested in the voting on April 29.

, Those elected as junior represen-
tatives to Council are Betty Quar-
rie, Col.; Nathan Ganger,’Bus. Ad.;
W. D. Grove, Eng., and Bernard E.
Curran, Mines. Dorothy Lewis,
Ed., who was appointed by Senior
Court to junior membership after
Rose Marie Demestichas, Col., had
been forced to relinquish her senior
position because of other activities, -
and ,Paul- Wilkesin, Dent., also
elected on April 29, are the other
junior members who will serve
next yearas student legislators.

Stud , ts. oted 317 to 34 in favor

 and more adequate‘
student health service, as recom-
mended by Student Council after
investigation of the present facili-
ties.

' Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the Dean of Men, who called for
and handled this week's election
after evidence of fraudulent ballot-
ing in all the schools represented
in Council except those of Educa-
tion and Dentistry had been dis,-
closed in the ﬂrst vote, was well
pleased with conduct at the polls
on Monday. He said:

“There was no evidence of fraud-
ulent or irregular balloting in Mon-
day’s revote. I have every reason
to believe that the election, as han-
dled by the student oﬂicials ap-
pointed from this office, was entire-
ly honest and above reproach."

Three hundred ninety-three bal-
lots were cast in the four schools,
less than nine per cent of all those
eligible to vote. In the College 168
ballots were cast, in the School of
Business Administration, 113, in
the School of Engineering, 94, and
in the School of Mines, 18. '

ple per hour who pass by without
looking, the number of people per
hour who look at the‘ windows
without stopping, and the number
of peoplee. who actually stop and
look at the windows, a comparative
study is made possible. The

Petition For
New Speaker

Many Students Oppose
General MacArthur

 

Decrying the selection of Gen-
eral Douglas MacArthur, Chief-of-
Staff, United States Army, a group
of students have circulated a peti-
tion of protest among students on
the campus.

The petition quotes Gen. Mac-
Arthur as saying, “A war-like
spirit, which alone can create and
civilize a state, is absolutely es-
sential to national defense and na-
tional perpetuity,” and asserts
that such an attitude of mind has
no place at a University convoca-
tion.

The petitioners further state
that in view of the fact that the
governments of the ‘ world have
signed pacts for peace, that educa-
tional and religious institutions
throughout the world are striving
to create peace mindedness, it is
imperative that they take their
stand in opposition to the selec-
tion of Gen. MacArthur as com-
mencement speaker.

According to Franklin Yellig,
Mines '32, who has been active in
behalf of the petition, the matter
will be referred - to Chancellor
Bowman. Yeflig said, “We don't
deny the freedom of any man to
speak, for we stand for free speech,
but we decry the selection of a
professional ﬁghter when there
are available so many other out-
standing educators.”

  The Campus

Scout Says:

 



-present time, a new threat was growing up in the Far West.

-1 for that matter, could hold a candle to the Bears.

' Believe it or not, but the Pitt football team is stepping up into the
“big time.” We always had a suspicion that such was the intent of the
athletic authorities, but we were never fully convinced until the game
with Stanford was scheduled last week. Penn State, a dear old rival of
the traditional variety, was dropped to make room for the team from
the Paciﬁc Coast.

Now that we have made the somewhat bold statement which inau-
gurates this week’s dispatch, we know that we will hear bitter words of
criticism from loyal grads and school-spirited undergrads. “Hasn’t Pitt
alwaysheen among the elite in collegiate gridiron circles? Whoever
says, that it hasn't is either crazy or just plain ignorant.”

_ To be truthful, Pitt has compiled great records in the past.
It has gone through season after season winning more than
three-fourths of its scheduled games; and at different times, it ‘
has been crowned Eastern and national champion by good pub-
licity men. But what teams did the Panthers meet during these
p’eriods?

Pitt’: first golden era of football lasted from 1915 to 1918,
inclusive, the first four years of Pop Warner's regime at the
University. The Panthers won eight games each in the first
two of these seasons, ninegames in the third,'ancl four in the
fourth which was cut short by the war.

But a. look at the opponents met during that time shows that the

Panthers did not have a tough row to roe in order to obtain their goal
of an undefeated season. The opponents in 1915 were Westminster,
Navy, Carlisle, Penn, Allegheny, Wash-Jeff, Carnegie Tech and Penn
State. Of these, only Navy and Penn could be considered of better
than average caliber; and these were in their position because of their
early start at the game and previously gained reputations. Carlisle was
onthe decline and was defeated 45-0. Carnegie Tech was still a class
B school as far as football was concerned; and none of the other teams
met enjoyed high ranking nationally.
I In 1917, the Pitt schedule called for games with West Vir-
ginia, Bethany, Lehigh, Syracuse, Penn, Westminster, Wash-
Jeff, Carnegie Tech and Penn State. How many of these teams
enjoyed national reps? Not many. West Virginia was coming.
up but had not quite arrived. Penn was still regarded as one
of the elite, but none of the others was known beyond the Al-
leghenies. “

And in 1918, the Panthers won over Wash-Jeff, Penn, Penn
.State and Georgia Tech. Only Georgia Tech, the then “Golden

Tornado,” had a national rep; but football was not highly de-
veloped in the South then and Tech’s record had been made
against Southern teams almost exclusively.

After those four years, a natural decline set in, and the Panthers
passed through many seasons of just fair and indifferent success. And
then Pop Warner left Pitt for the Coast and Sutherland transferred his
coaching duties from Lafayette to Pitthburgh. ‘Panther stock again as-
sumed an upwagd trend.

Pitt boasted of Eastern cllampionship teams in 1925, Sutherland’s
second year here; 1927, 1929 and 1931. But what teams were met at
these times? In the ﬁrst of these seasons, Gettysburg, John Hopkins,
Washington and Lee, West Virginia, Lafayette, Carnegie Tech, Penn,
Wash-Jeff and Penn State were met. All of these teams were from the
East. Lafayette won over the Panthers in the second game of the
season, but later achievements placed Pitt on the top rung.

Two yearslater Drake and Nebraska were played ‘in addi-
tion to seven district opponents. Drake was deﬁnitely on the
decline and succumbed 32-0. Three long runs, two by Gibby
Welch and one by Jimmy Hagan, enabled the Panthers to de-
feat the Cornhuskers, 21-13, even though the latter outplayed
the Panthers throughout the greater portion of the game. ’

In 1929, Duke and Ohio State were the two non-Eastern
opponents on the schedule. Duke had a new stadium and
Ohio State was -a second division team in the “Big Ten.” Last
year, Notre Dame, Army and Nebraska were the only well-
known teams which the Panthers met. Notre Dame beat Pitt

, but lost to Southern California and Army and was held to a

' scoreless tie by Northwestern. Army, whom Pitt defeated, also
lost to Harvard. Nebraska's record was also not without
blemish when the Cornhuskers came here, Northwestern hav-
ing defeated them, 19-7, in an early season tilt.

Thus we can see that although Pitt teams made good records, they
were not always made against the cream of the collegiate crop.
Between the time of Pitt's early success of 1915 to 1918 and the
Andy
Sn‘_iith’s famous California elevens had been considered the class of the
Coast. None of the other teams in that section, or in any other section

The Panthers defeated Stanford in a post-season tilt in 1922
by a ‘score of 22-7, but Stanford was not great then. In fact,
Pop Warner was still coach of the Panthers. When the Pan-
thers again played Stanford in the Tournament of Roses game
in 1927, the latter won, 7-6. In 1929, Pitt again traveled to the
Coast but suffered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of
Southern California, 47-14. Notre Dame took the measure of
Pitt both last year and the one preceding.

Four defeats and no victories is Pitt’s record against the cream of

the country. You can hardly call that top-notch football. Perhaps the ‘

reason for the failure on the part of the Panthers has been the lack of-
other classy opponents on their schedule. That reason has been ad-
vanced before and the Pitt authorities are taking cognizance of that
fact. Next year will see ”both Notre Dame and Stanford on the Pitt
program.

Other opponents include West Virginia, Army, Ohio State, Penn,
Nebraska, Carnegie Tech, Duquesne and Ohio Northern. At least four
of these have high-falutin’ national reps and should give the Panthers
some particle, of opposition. go

But the real motive behind the new schedule is an attempt onllle I

part of the Panthers to climb into the elite and, if possible, stay there.

‘The Panther spikers will nieet

their second opponent of the week
Vvednesday when they face the

at the Stadium.

- The Tartans have defeated Pitt
on the cinders only once in four-
teen meets. Pitt won the ﬁrst two
meets in 1907 and 1908, and then
Tech copped th‘e victory in 1909.
Since then, the Tartans have bee
unable to win. '

-_ The outstanding member of the
Tartan -team is Captain Tom Coul-
ter,»“<long' Canadian boy, who is al-
most certain to be a member of
the Canadian Olympic team this
summer. Coulter has been running
the two hurdles and either the 440-
yard dash or the 220., with great
success.
Sets School Marks.

Last week, Coulter stepped the
220 against VV. & J. in 22.2 seconds
for a new Carnegie Tech track rec-
ord. The Carnegie leade-r runs the
440 in around 50 seconds flat. He
ﬂashes over the 220-yard low hur-
dles in 24.7 seconds and over the
120-yard highs in 15.1, both of
which are school records. He is
sure to take both hurdles against
Pitt, and very likely will win the
third event in which he is entered.

“Woody” Harris and Bill Keller
will offer Coulter stiff opposition if
he runs in the 220 or 440.

Art Sigmund and Jagques Crois-
sant, the latter a varsity football
and boxing star, race the dashes.
They are of about average ability,
and Harris, Milligan, and Keller,
the latter in the 220, should beable
to best them in the sprints.

Middle Distancemen Poor.

Ewing, Brewer, and Carr run the
440. None of these are better then
middling. ' Schall, Stankey, and
Mitchell pace the 880. Schall is
quite fast and will give Watkins a
good race Wednesday although the
Panther should win. Ramsay and
Allen cover the mile for Tech and
Price, Lord, and Burns‘ stagger
through the two mile. '

Prep boys tomorrow at the Stadium
in a meet to be run off in conjunc-

is a promising broad jump star.
The prep school boys have already

met and defeated the Carnegie
Tech freshmen, 67-50.

Next Tuesday, the little Panthers
face the Carnegie Tech frosh in a
meet to be held in conjuction with
the varsity Pitt-Carnegie Tech
meet. Tech will be led by Perina,
ﬂashy sprinter. A real duel is an-
ticipated when Perina runs against
the sterling Panther trio of sprint-
ers,_ Menaker, Jacobson, and
Schlossberg.

V_ Last Saturday, for the ﬁrst time
in history, the Cubs defeated the
Lion freshmen, 85-50. The Panth-
ers won ten ﬁrst places while the
Lions were able to win only five.
The Panthers swept three events.

Menaker, Jacobson, and Schloss-
berg swept the two sprints’, ﬁnish-
ing in that order each time. Flem-
ing won the 220 yard low hurdles
and the broad jump, and Bonavita
coppe-d the shotput and the hammer
throw. Gongloff won the javelin,
Smith won the discus, Alb-right was
best in the two mile run, and Kiger
and McDonald ﬁnished tied for
ﬁrst in the 440. All these men were
from Pitt.

Woody Harris Star As
Pitt Loses to Penn State

Last Saturday, the Pitt boys went
to Penn State to receive a most
convincing licking, 891/_>-451/g. The
Lions made clean sweeps in the
javelin, high jump and low hurdles,
while the Panthers made a grand
slam in the discus. Penn State
took ten ﬁrsts to Pitt’s ﬁve.

“Woody” Harris was the big star,
copping the 100 and 220 yard dash-
es and taking second in the 440.
Valenti took ﬁrst in the discus,
MacMurdo heaved the shot farther
than anybody else, and Sebastian
pulled out a first in the broad jump.

winners last year, copped the In- .

terfraternity Sweepstakes last Fri-
day, and Kappa Sigma took the

Greek track championship last
Thursday at the Stadium.
Ten fraternities entered the

pnshmobile derby, in which two
heats were run. In the ﬁrst heat,
ﬁve teams started, but the Lambda
Chi Alpha and‘Sigma Chi pu'shmo-
biles collided and both dropped
from the race. Coming down the
home stretch in the first heat, the
Phi Kappa steering gear went
wrong, and the cart ran wild and
struck a woman spectator. The
Phi Gamma Delta entry then went

on to win, followed by Theta Delta
Psi. ’. S

In the second heat, all ﬁve
teams ﬁnished. Delta Tau Delta
got a away to a good start and
won quite easily, with Sigma Alpha
Epsilon following.

After times had been compared, _

it was found that the Delts were
fastest with 4207.2. The Ph-i Gams
were next best, and Sigma Alpha
Epslon was third.

Last Thursday, the various frats

Panther Team 

 

The competition between Notre Dame and Pitt will be ex- ‘
tended tomorrow when the Panther track team meets the Irish ' -
spikers at the Stadium for the ﬁrst meet in the history of both‘_ _

schools.

In past years Pitt has met Notre Dame in football, baskets

ball, tennis, golf and swimming

and now track enters the sports
A

series.

T

The Panthers, touted at the be- tiof the Irish squad. He ran a great; R
ginning of the year, as an excep-.; anchor race" to win the two mile’-'i‘

tionally powerful team, have
both their outdoor meets thus far;
and chances for a change tomorrow
are not favorable. The Ramblers,
on the other hand, have won all
their indoor meets, defeating Mar-
quette, Iowa, Butler and Illinois.
In addition their relay teams enter-
ed in the Kansas and Drake Re-
lay made an excellent. showing,
They also won the annual Central
Intercollegiate Conference indoor
meet.

In the Kansas Relays, the Notre
Dame’s two mile relay team won
on a muddy track in 8:O3.3. It was
the only Irish team entered.

In the Drake Relays, the Ram-
blers took major honors by winning
tworelays and placing second in
another relay with only three teams
entered. The ‘two mile team cop-
ped the event in 7:48.8 for a new
Drake" record, The mile team won
in 3219.9 which is plenty fast.

The captain of the Notre Dame
team is Bill McCormack, star
sprinter. McCormack has done the
100 yard dash in 9.6 seconds on two
occasions. He will run the 100 and
220 for the Irish tomorrow.
“Woody” Harris, who has been
running magniﬁcently for Pitt late-
lyl, willoffer the Notre Dame cap-
tain stiff opposition- If McCormack
runs in 9.6 form, then he will win.
Otherwise, Harris very probably
will take the events. Milligan,
whose knee. has been handicapping
him, will be a second Pitt runner in
the events.

There are four good Irish quarter
milers, Alex Wilson, Charles Kel-
ley, Rudy Obergfall and John Scan-
lon. Wilson is the outstanding: star

Gene Howrey is better than av-

enough to win easily tomorrow.
Bob Darling, Irish high jump ace

HIS MORNING WE are experiencing what it means to

We are going to wax sentimental, because there is a
' sentiment that grows up around activities, and it is about
this that we wish to speak. Vile want to do this before we
entrust the future of the Weekly to the new staﬁ members
“whose eagerness to slide into Senior chairs may make us a
triﬂe resentful, simply because it is hard to give up a pro-
ject that has in itself been of such great interest.
We were alone in the office the other evening . . . that -
oﬁiee, that hasalways been too hot, tooicold, too dark, or
too noisy . . . that oiiice where it has been a lot of fun to
"pound out news on an antidiluvian sort of Underwood, to

 -3‘ _ slap ‘on heads, and to run the blue pencil through Fresh-

man':eopy._ Maybe it was the last shafts of daylight that
seemed to bounce oﬁ the dusty typewriters. Maybe it was

if the melancholy tune that some idler picked off the piano in

the hallway. Maybe it was the emptiness of the room that
is usually crowded. But whatever the reason, we suddenly
realized that we had “put to bed” our last Weekly.
Four years in writing stories about the Cosmopolitan
””Club,- four years in cataloguing every name with the school
and year, as “Col. ’32,” four years in learning to juggle the
Greek letters of the honorary societies, and now it’s all
over! One cannot go in and out of the same buildings, up
and down the same stairways, and to and fro on the same
road for four years, with a crowd of one ’s friends, doing

as they do, sharing their lot,
buildings,»the stairways and the roads.

also explains why it is a difficult task for those of us who

have to give up the Weekly.

without growing to love the
That is why it is

The two years that it has beenour fortune to direct
‘ , the Weekly have been good and interesting ones. We have

done nothing for which to expect regrets.

All that we

have done in antagonism to those whose points of views dif-
fered, we have done because it has ever been the purpose
of the Weekly to make a better University, a better place
for students, a higher accomplishment for a dream unful-

ﬁlled.

So now there remains nothing else to do but to wish
those who will make up the new staff the best of luck, and
to any one who has in any way or measure contributed to
the organized eﬁorts of the Pitt Weekly during the past
two years, we say a hearty “Thank You.” ‘

Odd Editorial cries

HE SPRING FESTIVAL is over, successful and thor-
oughly enjoyed. From an entertainment standpoint, it

was a complete triumph.

And now to sound a dissenting note .

believe entirely in order. The Spring Festival took the time
of every student, particularly those "who participated in
the various events. It is a question whether or not it is wise
to sacriﬁce this time with the end of school so near at hand.
And we say this with the knowledge that it sounds like -an
attempt to throw a damper on the one time that Pitt goes

So, to meet special conditions, Bell System
men custom-ﬁt the service to the subscriber.

They worked out a telephone conference
plan for a large manufacturer. Every Friday,
at speciﬁed times, each district manager calls
the home office, where telephone facilities are

so arranged that the chief sales executives are
on the line simultaneously. Problems are dis-
cussed, decisions given. In minutes, the ex-
ecutives cover the country. This plan lowered
selling costs, raised cﬂiciency, helped the user
