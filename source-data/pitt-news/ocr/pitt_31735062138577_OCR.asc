“"7 The freshman class may be green, but they yvere sharp
enough to walk away with the Inter-Class Sing cup.

Their enthusiastic portrayal of Pa Pitt's Doll Shop from
which Santa Claus naturally bought the freshman doll, won

 Coming in a very close second, the juniors, sister class of

“Christmas at Pitt is Christmas ’Round the World.” Girls.
‘%dressed in costumes of other lands, a choral speaking musical

» background, and songs representative of these lands brought

fforth -the idea that the culture of these lands is within our

own University. ' _

“Ac me sound of the gong it will
be exactly 8:31 Otto Cream-Top
Milk Time,” so mumbles the radio
announcer from my portable. Frat
men are happy. That means they on-
sly have to wait 12 and a half more
hours until they can dance to Billy
Hinds music at the IF Ball.

Turning out 100% this evening
will be the Pi Kappa Alpha’s, back-
ing their good brother Bob Burford
who chairmans and leads the dance
with June Thomson. Last Saturday
the fraternity celebrated Jean Bisch-
oi’f’s 19th birthday at the Anchor-

age. After they cut the cake, Jim '

Duchene passed around a glass bank
for donations for, “Today, Jean
Bischoff Day.” V _ '

On Sunday, the Beta Sigma Omi-
erons will celebrate their 55th
birthday with a Founders Day Tea
at the College Club. Actives an
alumnae will attend. «

Tomorrow night the Theta Pi Al-
pha’s will put out a big welepme mat
for the Air Cadets that the gals have
invited to their Xmas dance. Co-
chairmen Eleanor Lauria and Ber-
nadett Sullivan promise a big tree
and favors for the boys. Next Wed-
nesday the fraternity plans their an-
nual doll ‘party. Each girl brings a
doll, and then they are all turned
over to an orphans home or to a
charitable organization.

By JEANNETTE 1'-‘ELDMA_N '

Within the past few weeks, Pitt graduates have been stopping in
the Tuck Shop and other corners of school, to tell us about the various
branches of the service and their e>_<peri_ences in them. Letters from
former students, both in the states and overseas, have been coming in
abundance, making real events that we read about in the newspapers.

On leave ‘after completion of? ‘
their work at OCS in Fort'Monroe,
Va., were Lts. Jim De Garmo, -Ed
Byers, Bob’ Sullivan, Jim Dunn,
and Mark Crum. The boys graduat-
ed in the same class and were de-
lighted to be home at the same time.

Lt. Pete Wynn is now stationed
at Fort Bliss, Texas, as Ordin-
ance Oﬂicer with the Coast\Ar-
tillery. To make it all very chum-
my, Lts. Mike De Marco and
Vince Matera who graduated with
him, are spending their time there
too. Another classmate of theirs,

“Lt. Aldo Icardi, is on his way. ovn -

erseas. ’ V V

From Italy, Capt. Bill McQuade
writes that he has met Pitt4gradu-
ates in many strange places. He
ﬁnds Italy “interesting and enjoy-
able.”

Cpl. Sidney Siegal says about

England—“It’s quite a nice place’
when you become, acclimated to
the fog.”‘He has seen Oxford and
thinks-it~a great place.
-Major-Ber-nard E. Babcock trav-
‘eled .over . 40,000 miles in four
’months and hit every place but Aus-
tralia, Hawaii, and Alaska. He met
Bill Keller in'Algiers, Bill McQuade
in Oran, Chuck Gordon in New Del-
hi, and two or three ’37 ‘classmates
in London. His comment about his
global travels:—“I was on the Tun-
isian front for the clean-up and
went back in the brush after Japs in
China. I was aide to one of General
Somervile’s » right—hand men and
sure saw the world.’’ He ﬁnally end-
ed, up at Command and General
Staff School at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, and was impatient to head
overseas again.

Sports Editor

It is two years and three days since Pearl Harbor, but it‘ -
is doubtful whether college athletic directors will ever require
a special day of comn1e_p1o1'atio11 to bring it to mind, for cole-
legiate athletics were this first to feel its eﬁ’ects.. _ '

College athletes, generally speaking,‘ were neither “too  _
young nor too old.” And nice college athletes were not supposed ' ' if
to have dependents. If they did, people became suspic'ious,lso.
there were faculty committees, freshman rules, transfer rules, '
and assorted codes to_take care of such matters. V

We still remember the Monday noon in the Old Pitt -News
when we clustered about the radio to hear the President ask" 
for a declaration of war. It was common talk _then that ‘there- ‘

wouldn’t be a boy left in school by the following January. As 2
for, sports, they were mourned quietly, the sheet was pulled‘  

« up, and everyone sat back and waited for the undertaker" to i - .

cart away the body.
Butthings returned to a semblance of normal. There were

taken during the spring vacation was cancelled, because, sud- .
denly, there wasn’t any spring vacation’. We had a tri-mester 
instead. Then too, the railroads werepjust beginning to adver- .5 - f;
tise that, after all, there is no place like home——particularly if  
iahsoldier or a sailor could make better use of your seat on  
e train. - P ' ‘ ’ ‘

The coaches began to ﬁlter into the services: Swimming; 
(1\3Ioach Ben Gradyand Track'Coach Carl Olson entered the 
avy. v :. ":  a .

Football noted the change gradually.last year. A service 1:‘. 5:‘
team, Great Lakes was added to the schedule. 5

The Panthers traveled in day coaches. instead of -private 
pullmans._Th-e teams were the same, but the coaches weredif-‘ ' EL
ferent. Duke didn’t have Wallace Wade; Nebraska was minus 
Colonel Biif Jones, Minnesota had Dr. George Hauser in".
place of_ Bernie Bierman who was directing the Iowa Sea-H.
hawks. The freshman rule was amended to permit the use of." ‘
freshman ‘players against other teams using ‘them. But most f
of the players were still here. . 

That was last year. This year was a different andalready 10
well known story. For the Navy Iaided teams, war wasn’t'so 
bad after all.‘ For the others,‘ Pitt included, it was exactly what” i J‘
Sherman said it was. Yet, .despite the blasts of Gene Tunney,“
the ‘schools that continued athletics have shown no tendency  ,
toregret it, whereas many schools, like Harvard, who origin-
ally dropped football completely, later resumed it on an _in- 
formal basis. . ‘ 1 1 ‘

Athletic Director James Hagan has promised that Pitt-'
will have a baseball team this yearif they can get nine boys ~ -L‘ '5
together who want to play. Baseball at Pitt, however, has suf- 
fered more from a lack of opponents than from a lack of play-; - "
ers.~Few district colleges ﬁeld baseball teams. and the teams, « ~
farther, away —won_’t travel here. Last year’s team" iorigvinally-3*
had a seven game schedule. West Virginia dropped baseball.
and that left six games. Two wefe. rained out and that ﬁnally  =
left the Panthers with a four gamexschedule. ‘ A

Pitt will also have something in the-way of a golf‘an'd'. 
tennis team. but track is out for the duration. ‘ "._'

As for football, Pitt is going straightahead, although
the_coaches and Jimmy Hagan optimistically forcast that 
“things are going to be worse next year.” Once upon a time 
“high school” player was a mild term of opprobrium. Now, ~

   
  
    
  

average age is 16 or 17 and _the weights are correspondingly; , 

Unlike the baseball team, the Panthers are not likely to .‘
lack ,for opponents. Games already listed as certainties include
Northwestern, Illinois, Ohio State, Penn_State, and Carnegie 
Tech, if Tech ﬁelds a team. West Virginia is also ‘a pretty r
sure bet to ﬁll a spot on the 1944 schedule. ‘ ' — . 

_ Pitt’s westward movement has been temporarily halted " 
by transportation diﬁiculties, but it is reported that several big . .
eastern teams will be added to the schedule soon. One sucl'1_‘,f  :
change is expected to be announced over the weekend. Could it  
possibly be Army? . -l
