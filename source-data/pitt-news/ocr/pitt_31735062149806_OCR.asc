For Coming Exarnimitions ll/ithout ‘Cramming’

By Irwin Rosen

“Use my system, it works!” de-
clared Dr. John J. Geise, associate
professor of history.

“My advice on studying for ex-
amination is based on years of ex-
perience with the psychology of
learning,” said Dr. Alfred G. Deitze,
assistant professor of psychology.

“My plan is the same one that’s
been serving me well sin-ce my un-
dergraduate days,” revealed Dr.
Walter A. Lunden, assistant profes-
sor of sociology.

And so, three University profes-
sors, each of them advocating “their
own special technique” for studying
for ﬁnal examination, gave Pitt
News reporters amazingly identical
statements regarding preparation
for next week’s ﬁnals.

Dr. Geise offered for student con-
sumption his “three step” formula
to do away with cramming a system
which be affirmed was “guaranteed
to work.”

“First,” said Dr. Geise “study
your assignments, your instructor

and yourself, as they have progress-
ed since the ﬁrst meeting of the
class, pointing to the ﬁnal. Next,
on the night before the test, think
through the major highlights of the
course, then forget about it, and
get at least eight hours sleep. Last-
ly, come into the test relaxed, and
stay relaxed throughout the exam.”

Dr. Lunden’s “private technique”
bore a distinct similarity to the
“conﬁdential system” of Dr. Geise,
for both agreed that the student
should pay little attention to the
minute details of the course, but
should concentrate on the major ob-
jectives of the course. Dr. Lunden
agreed that it was wise not to study
the night before the exam, but said
that an “informal discussion of the
subject matter between the stu-
dents” would help a lot.

The Lunden system, like the
Geise technique, calls for the re-
hashing of the semester’s assign-

ments, with an attempt to analyze
the subject matter, and separating

Lunden Cffers
New Subject

Sociology of law, a new course of-
fered in only a few colleges in the
country, will be taught next se-
mester for the ﬁrst time at the Uni-
versity by Dr. Walter A. Lunden,
assistant professor of sociology.

The course is a “new departure in
sociology at the University and a
new development of sociology
throughout the country.”

Including the study of social
origins of laws. and customs, the
course will provide an approach
to law from a sociological viewpoint
rather than from a legal or political
aspect.

“The whole structure of state is
changing so rapidly that an under-
standing of the social interpreta-
tion is especially valuable,” accord-

value of the course.

Dr. Lunden announced that the
work in the course will be com-
pleted in one semester and will be
offered the ﬁrst hour, Monday, Wed-
nesday and Friday.

Six credits in sociology are pre-
requisite for taking the course.

Sociology of law originated in
Harvard where it is being taught.
The school of law at Washington
University offers a similar course.

Dr. Lunden declared, “It will
take a couple of years for the course
to develop and grow.” He is conﬁ-
dent of success, however.

Design for Living

the important from the insigniﬁcant.
7 Dr. Lunden offered also a now-
iunhclpful bit of advice when he
said, “of course, it’s better to study
at the beginning of the semester
,than at the end.”
_, Dr. Dietz-e’s “psychologically
fsound” set of rules for preparation
for finals was practically a repeti-
tion of the systems that came out
of the sanctums of the history and
the sociology departments.
 “Cramming,” he said, “results in
‘:blocking,” or the interference of
ideas with one another.” He stated
.hat a system of “spaced reviews”
 etween now and the time of the
fexamination would prove most ben-
eﬁcial, since you can “get more
_jwith less effort,” by such a plan.
Dr. Dietze stressed the folly of
attempting to restudy the whole
éourse. “Pick out what is import-
ant; summarize it; quiz yourself
frequently between now and the
test on the subject matter, and you
will be using the approved psychol-
fogical methods for learning.”

Pitt Players Build ‘Golden Boy’

Stage Sets from Experience

The atmosphere of the gymnasium and Italian home in Pitt Players’
production of Clifford Odets’ “Golden Boy” on March 19 and 21, will be
realistic if Bill McElwain, C41, and August Trovaioli, C43, have any-

thing to say about it.
Madison Square Garden to a typical
immigrant Italian’s dining-front
room will be built from experience,
the co-designers say.

Building a gymnasium will be
second nature to McElwain, who
will use his experience gained as
sports editor of the Pitt News. The
home scenes will be designed by
Trovaioli, who received his ideas
for the set from close association
with Italian immigrants. The orig-
inal sets will be built entirely from
suggestions in the script and the
designer’s own imaginations. 1 Fur-
niture for the home will be se-
lected by Trovaioli to insure its
appropriateness.

Plot Centers About Racket

The plot of the three-act drama
centers around the prize-ﬁghting
racket, and tells the story of the
rise of a sensitive, violin—playing
prize-ﬁghter, Joe Bonaparte. The
play opens in the small Broadway
office of Tom Moody, the ﬁght man-
ager. It is a gloomy room, scantily
furnished with a desk, chair, and
ancient couch. Six feet high
wainscoted walls complete the set.
Action then shifts to the,Bonaparte
dining-front room. The furniture
is semi—Victorian in style, and the
walls are covered with green wall-
paper.

The third scene takes place in
the same ﬁght manager’s office.
Central Park provides the theme
for the next scene. There is a
bench, some shrubbery, and the
lights of», Manhattan in the back-
ground. The ﬁnal scene occurs in
the Bonaparte home.

Action In Gymnasium

Most of the action in act two re-
volves around the gymnasium and
the dressing room in the boxing
arena. The ﬁrst scene presents a
corner of a gymnasium, containing
a bulletin board, which is covered
with faded boxing signs. The walls
are of glazed brick and cheap plas-
ter. The absence of windows gives
the room a dreary atmosphere.

Final action of the play takes
place in Moody’s ofﬁce, the dress-
ing room and in the Bonaparte
home. In addition to helping with
the designs, McElwain is assistant
director and stage manager. Tro-
vaioli is scenic artist for the Play-
ers and will also play the role of
Fuselli in the production.

Faculty to Hear Counts
At Monday Luncheon

Faculty members who wish to at-
tend the luncheon of the College
Teachers federation. on Monday,
January 27, in the Ruskin apart-
ments are asked to make reserva-
tions with Hugh Wing, English de-
partment, or Dr. Verne Wright, so-
ciology department.

Dr. Wright, who will act as chair-
‘man, announces that the guest
speaker, Dr. George S. Counts, will
discuss “Education and the Defense
of Democracy.”

Dr. Counts is a widely known
educator and president of the
American Federation of Teachers.

Students not protected under the
Pitt News-Student Health service
group hospitalization insurance plan
the ﬁrst semester will have a chance
to be enrolled under the plan dur-
ing registration, when, by paying
the second semester’s fee of $2.50,
they can join the service.

Old members of the plan must
also ‘pay the second semester fee if
they want to continue to enjoy the
protection offered by the plan, ex-
plained Drs. H. C. Carlson and
Auleene M. Jamison, directors of
the Student Health service.

Group hospitalization, introduced
on campus by the Pitt News and
the Student Health service, protects
the student against lack of ﬁnancial
support in the striking of sudden,
serious illness. By providing eight
speciﬁc beneﬁts, including 21 days
of free hospitalization, the plan has
proven of utmost value to its many

subscribers last semester, the direc-
tors explained. ‘

College Introduces

Geo-Physics Class

Courses in geo—physics will be‘
added to the curriculum of the Uni-
versity next semester for the ﬁrst
time, announces Stanton C. Craw-
ford, dean of the College.

This course will include studies
in meteorology, physics, geology,
mathematics, chemistry, and other
supplementary courses, and will
lead to a bachelor of science de-
gree with the major in geo—physics.

   

permit work in the ﬁelds of ter-
restial magnetism, seismology, me-
teorology, oceanography, volcanolo-
gy. Other related subjects may

also be applied in a practical way

in prospecting for natural resources
and in engineering.

New Course on American Art
Added to FineArts Curriculum

Fine arts department has announced the addition of a new course

in American art for the second semester.

This new course was insti-

tuted because of the great interest in American art aroused last fall by
the American Survey of Painting presented at Carnegie in place of the

annual international exhibit, which
was deferred because of the war.
Walter“Read Hovey, professor and
head of the department of ﬁne arts,
who will teach the course, says
that because of. the present Euro-
pean situation, Americans are be-
coming more conscious of their own
culture and conscious of their im-
portance in the world today.

The course will be a historical
survey which will connect the
American expression with the great
traditions of European culture. It
will emphasize the racial back-
ground in the formation of Amer-
ican taste. The survey will start
with the colonial art of the 17th
century and end with the contem-
porary art. It will also include the
architecture of the various eras.

The contemporary art will be
constantly kept in mind and the
historical background will be a
means of a better understanding
our own times. Work of outstand-

Music-Nlates

 

ing architects will be discussed and
in addition, the folk arts and dec-
orative arts in relation to their
native signiﬁcance as a means of
determining an essentially Ameri-
can style.

“If America,” said Mr. Hovey, “is
to grasp the great opportunity now
before it of carrying on the cul-
tural traditions being disrupted in
Europe; it is essential that we sense
the latent possibilities that we may
develop something worthy of this
tradition.”

The course will emphasize West-
ern Pennsylvanian developments.
It should aﬁord an excellent tie-up
with American history from the po-
litical, social and economic views,
and with American literature.

The course lectures will be illus-
trated with lantern slides. The
course will be offered Saturday
mornings from 11 to 1 o’clock for
two credits.

What is perhaps the most dangerous situation
that we have ever faced. . In attempts to be
forceful, he puts us in a position of imminent
danger of invasion. Lined up with Mr. Roose-
velt in his views are such men as the war
secretary, Henry Stimson, Colonel Knox of the
Navy, Mr. Knudsen of the defense commission,
the State -:lepartment’s Mr. Hull, and even Re-
publican, Wendell Willkie. These men base our
hope and our salvation on a program of all
possible aid to Britain. Their words are serious
and foreboding. I

On the other hand there are Senator Wheeler,
Colonel Lindbergh, former ambassador Ken-
nedy, Congressman Fish, and Mr. Hull’s oppon-
ent of late, Representative Tinkham, who claim
that weare in no danger of invasion’, that this
is Britain’s war, that the United States can
stand on its own feet, and’, in other words, that
the crisis is not of grave or of immediate dan-
ger to us. ‘

Thus We have the question, crisis or no crisis.
While debate and argument in a democracy is
-one.method of getting to the bottom of a situ-
ation and separating biased opinions from facts,
in the present case it might prove to be either
a serious waste of time and delay in prepara-
tion, or the expansion of our industry into a
false boom and a real collapse based on a false
economy.

If a real crisis exist, everyone, including cap-
ital. and labor; income tax payers and cigarette
tax payers; Democrats and Republicans; and
BMI and ASCAP should. roll up their collective
sleeves and go to work, not to make the world
safe for democracy but to make democracy safe
for the people.

If, on the other hand, no such crisis exists,
We shoul.d cease in such efforts which in time
Will surely promote a crisis. We should make
ourselves stronger with an eye to the future.
We should mind our own business as much as
possible, but, at the same time, be alert and on
our toes. 'We will have to make up our minds
or have them made up for us.-—B'ilZ Jamison.

“J/'e offer comment on this bill to “P1~._~.r‘io‘io the De-
fense of the Uttitecl St::.1tes., and for other purposes” as
:1 means of ui1tanglir'ig niisconccptio is that acciclentally
form v.«'hcn students glance  headlines or twist dials.

This  not a Dir.:.tator Bill,  clainwd. In Monday’:
l\?c-ws we summarized the possibilities of further aid
to Bl‘liE3.'l.1 “short of di:ect pa-...ici}_:ation in the war.”
Direct participation in the war will not result as an
etl’ect cf the passage of this bill, as claimed.

 

Powers Airemly Grrmted

After carefully considering HRl7.76. designed to aid
Britain. we categoricall.y believe that the bill provides
no powers nor sets up any principles which have not
already been deemed granted and used by the gov-
ernment; and which the President already knows are
his. Objection to this bill as a “war bill” or a “die-
tator bill” is ‘uncalled for from thinking people.

Concerning sections 2 and 3: U. S. production, sale,
on transfer (destroyers, guns) of “defense articles” to
Britain during the first 16 months of war have included
every item mentioned in these sections and every fa-
cility listed. “Repair or servicing” would easily be-
come legal without Congressional consent. The de-
stroyer-base deal became a fait accornpli with only
5000 words by the attorney-general. And out of the
September ship deal we were promised the British
navy. (On this subject. the Hull-Roosevelt-Lothism-
Churchill letters seem to be of more import than a
contract clause under Section 4, requiring the Presi-
dent’s consent before the Germans could attempt to
seize the Royal Navy as they did American airplanes
in France last June.) We have granted new bombers,
new gunsights, new chemical formulae to Britain this
is “defense information” as under Section 2, (b).

For Sale: One Navy

Section 3a, (5) is well developed. Last Saturday
Mr. Hull issued a blanket exemption from embargo‘
orders of any strategic war materials shipped to Canada;
and the same policy is in effect as concerns Great
Britain. This also covers Section 5.

Summarizing the entire bill we believe that most
of the provisions and powers have already been estab-
lished and well developed. Above all, the provision in
the Constitution, Art. 2, Sec. 2: “The President shall
be commander—in—chief of the army and’ rravy” sets"
an excellent basis for Presidential maneuvering of our
armed forces, if necessary, without any C'on‘gressi’on‘al'
action. Aside from the charge that the bill would in‘-
directly involve us in war thru ship maneuvers-—wh‘i'ch,
we see, is possible without the bill—-this l‘egi'slati'on does’
the congress the ‘exclusive constitutional
power “to declare war.” ‘  A

Real Purposes of Bill

We "believe the real purposes of this bill are‘: (I)-
to center attention on the crisis that as yet has not
been fully appreciated by the American people because
of its scope, its camouﬂage, its censorship, and its‘ di-
version by certain groups; (2) to strengthen. the bar-
gaining position of the United States‘ by conferring‘
Congressional consent upon the already well‘—deﬁ'ned‘
Presidential activities; (3) to strengthen morale at home‘
and to weaken the morale of the axis governments in
their relations with the United States.

There are many well-wishing people who set
HR 1776 up as a straw man for a Dictator, and then:
proceed to denounce the bill, its Congressi.onal back-
ers, the Admin.istra1;i.on, and American foreign policy..
We believe those people are only confusing the issue‘.
HR 1776 is more important as an expression of the:
procedures of Constitutional government than it is
necessary for Presidential action.

We believe the Administration  intended the bill?
as such. And we believe that the Congress should con-
sider it as such, rather than using the oppomunity to-
weaken an already carefully planned and well-executed‘
foreign policy that cannot be suddenly changed——poli--
tically or economically--—on February 1, 1940; rather‘
than use the opportunity to further confuse tl‘1e:A.rner-
ican public mind; rather than encourage the anti‘-
American elements in the country by considering" Con-
gressional procedure as a digniﬁed jam-session. The
country is not divided on political issues: this is a na-
tional issue, in which there are no political spoils.

Phi Kappa Titie-«Holders

Place Crown on Block

Against Sigma Alpha .Mu

BULi.E’IIN--Director of

intramural athletics

James Potts has

announced that all of last Friday’s Independ.e.ut league basketball games

have been rescheduled because of the ﬂu epidemic.

Volleyball com-

petition also may be rescheduled for the same reason.

With the majority of the frater-
nity quintets engaging in contests
for the last time this semester, the
clash between the undefeated riv-
als, Sigma Alpha Mu and «Phi Kap-
pa, tomorrow night at 9 ojclock pro-
vides a ﬁtting and dramatic first
half close. ‘

This battle of the undefeated will
pit a good big team against a good
small team, and the odds of such a
game are usually with the sky-
scrapers.

The little iron men of the Sam-
mie squad have been doing quite
well for themselves as their aver-
age of 30 points a game will show.
In pre-season forevasts, the SAM
team were no better than a dark
horse in the torrid IF race. But
at the present time their chances of
ending in the money are quite good.

In their opening game they bat-
tered a game SAE team into sub-
mission, 31-15. Following this Vic-

tory they took the measure of The-
ta Chi, Phi Delta Theta, and Kappa
Sigma.

Morrie Mayer and Hack White
have been the bulwark of a speedy
offense thus far this, season, and
have contributed the majority of
points. Harry Abramovitz, Mel
Frank, and Dan Colton have been
he defensive aces of the squad.

Phi Kappa, last .year’s champions,
have yet to. encounter trouble. In
their inaugural game they knocked
off the Phi Epsilon Pi team, 26-6,
then continued their hot pace by
beating Pi Lambda Phi, Pi Kappa
Alpha, and Sigma Chi.

The Phi Kap roster shows such

. notable veterans as captain Jack

Glenn, Bob Tyberski, Joe Connell,
and Bill Lohmeyer. Captain Glenn
is completing his fourth year on
the Phi Kap team, and will be aim-
ing to make his third appearance on
the all-intramural basketball team.

Pitt Skiers Place in Tourney

That skiing may eventually be
part of the athletic program here at
Pitt is becoming more and more
evident, for last Sunday the Pitt
Ski club attended their ﬁrst invita-
tion meet at Seven Springs Moun-
tain.

The local entries made their best
showing in the cross countryevent.
Paul Carpenter, MIT entry, copped
this event with the fast time of 20
minutes, 22 seconds. Harvey Lin-
coﬁ, C42, took third place with 21

minutes, 11 seconds as his time.
Bill Johns, E43, the other Pitt en-
trant, came in twelfth.

In the slalom Johns placed four-
teenth in a ﬁeld of 23, while Lin-
coﬂ? was disqualiﬁed when a poor
.,christie carried him into one of
the gates.

At present there are 17 members
in the local club. Anyone interest-
ed in the sport should come. to the

meeting of the club. today at 1:35

o’clock, in the Swedish room.

Several new rnethods in the

teaching oi‘ physical education are
zzdvocated in a new book vxritten
lsy Dr. Elwood C. Davis, head of
the dcpartinent of physical educa-
tion, anci John D. Lawther, profes-
sor in physical education and coach
of basketball at Pennsylvania State
coliicgc:\. The book, entitled “Suc-
cessiui Teo.ehing in Physical Educa-
tion,’'' came off the press this week.
Dr. llaavis and Mr. Lawther stress

 lb-o<:,~i«: the value of physical
ecu ‘ation inst:"u.ctC»1':: cooperating
with *-.1~:eir colleagues and the ad-
ministration of the school- “l‘-’l1_v~-
.s.ica'i eciucation teachers have all-
ways stressed the imf_3ortance of co-
operation between their students in
team sports, but they have often
neglected to promote cooperation
between themselves and the admin-
tration 0:’ their school,” says Dr.
Davis.

In methods of teaching, the new
book suggests basic principles of
teaching instead of insisting upon
minute, trivial details. Emphasis
is placed upon recognition of the
situation at hand before applying
any particular system.

 

i n.

The most recent ﬁndings of
psychology and related sciences

lave been applied in this up—to-
date treatment of the ﬁeld of phys-
ical education.

“Professor Lawthcr and I hope
the book will lead toward better
teaching in physical education,”
 Dr. Davis.

emblem of red, blue, and colorless
celloplzone patched together with
Eicotch tape.
