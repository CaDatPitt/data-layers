James Maude
Staff Writer

Pitt maintenance workers repre-
sented by the Service Employees
International Union Local 29 reject-
ed the contract being oﬂ"ered to them

by Pitt administration.

At a poll yesterday at the
University Club, 203 workers reject-

’ ed the contract, and only 108 voted

for it. The majority felt that the con-
tract was unfair, and that it offered
few beneﬁts while of1”ering a meager
raise in retum.

"The people have spoken. They
clearly don't want the contract," said
SEIU-29 President Billy Joe Jordan.
"They don't like the sinewy lan-
guage of the contract, and they don't
like losing their beneﬁts. We're not
gaining, we're losing, and that's the
bottom line."

The proposed contract included

vote

a clause which would require work-
ers to pay 15 percent of the increase
in health insurance next year. Sick
days and beneﬁts would also be
drastically capped, reducing sick
pay from 60 percent to 41 percent of
regular pay. '

One worker, who did not want
be named, said the University was
taking away fundamental basic
employee rights. She said workers
could not live on the contract Pitt
was offering them.

Jordan said the recent increase
in administration's salaries pushed
several workers to reject the con-
tract. The University claimed it
could not afford the union's
demands.

"They have oﬂices bigger than
this room [the University Club
lounge] and combined, Pitt adminis-
tralion earns $3 million," said one
worker, who wished not to be

 
 
 
 
  

named. "A family of four can't sur-
vive on what they're olfering us."
Low worker morale also con-
tributed to the vote. Many workers
felt they were undervalued, and their

importance was not recognized on -
. the campus.

"We're the pits of Pitt," said
another anonymous worker. "When
we do our jobs well, they don‘t_ so
much as say, ‘Way to go girl.’ Yet
they get $30,000 bonuses for doing
nothing out of the ordinary."

"They're downsizing us," said
one worker ﬁom Holland Hall, who
also wished to remain anonymous.
"I'm cleaning an area which only last
year was cleaned by two of us."

He added that workers who
retired or received workers‘ com-
pensation were not replaced.

"Pitt is acting like a big corpora-
tion. They're buying buildings all
over the place, granting themselves

huge increases and bonuses for
essentially doing their job. They
need to start acting like the academ-
ic institution they claim to be," said
Jordan. a

Jordan will contact Assistant
Chancellor Jerome Cochran, who is
negotiating on Pitt's behalf, and will
determine an appropriate course of
action depending on the administra-

_ tion's reaction.

If, however, the administration
does not go back to the negotiating
table, Jordan will press for a vote to
strike as soon as possible. 2

"Well, they're going to have big
problems if they don't. We're going
to take a stand; we're going to ﬁght

.want, for the contract SEIU-29

members deserve," said Jordan.

He said the majority of workers
appreciated ’ the student support
shown for their cause.

New Internet connection 100 times faster than current one

Michelle Singer

Staff Writer

A new generation of inter-
net is being born, one that is
capable of transmitting a 30
volume encyclopedia set in
less than one second.

Pitt is involved in
installing a high-powered
intemet connection that would
dramatically speed up trans-
missions. This advanced sys-
tem would also allow the most
powerful computers on cam-
pus —-—- even if they are located
in different places — to work
together to perform complex
calculations, such as predict-
ing the behavior of advanced
rocket engines. A

This is all part of a swifter
set of networks envisioned by
the Clinton administration’s
Next Generation Internet
Initiative.

The project, called the
Internet 2 Initiative,‘-is a com-
munications infrastructure
made up of a series of net-
works. Its primary mission is
to enhance the delivery of
educational material by fusing
all members of the academic

“We are system,
committed to many stu-

this project,”
said Dr. Paul
S t i e m a n ,
director of

P i t_ t ' s
Center for
Information Services.
“Right now we are in the
process of investigating the
processes of implementing
Internet 2, but we have not yet
integrated this new system
into our own.”

According to the National
Science Foundation, a primary
financial sponsor of the inter-
campus wiring, the Internet
has become cluttered with res-
idential and commercial users.

As a result, it is becoming"

more difficult for educators

   

  

dents to access
information adequately.
“Universities, which were
at the heart of the original
Internet, are now finding
themselves competing for
space on the present networ ,”
said Mike Roberts, director of
the Internet 2 Initiative.
“Internet 2 will enable stu-
dents, professors and
researchers to obtain high—vol-
ume computers at a signifi-
cantly faster rate than in the
existing system,” he added.
The system would also

dents think it takes a
significant amount of time
to download large text and
picture files. With Internet 2,
the time it takes to download
images or text would be
between 100 and 1,000 times
faster.
“This is an important tool
for a university to possess,"

. said Roberts.

According to the
University Corporation for
Advanced Internet
Development, the initiative
will develop ways to sort and
prioritize information, allow-
ing real—time video presenta-
tions to cruise past less urgent
e-mail on Internet connec-
tions.

Although" not a part of
Internet 2, the University has -.
recently integrated a faster
“intranet” system within the
campus. Most dorms have
already been supplied with
Ether-Net, or Res-Net, a resi-
dential network that allows
students to access the Internet
as well as their UNIX and
VMS accounts, without the
hassle of dealing with the
complexities of competing fo
login time. '

According to Computing
Information Systems, this sys-
tem is much faster than dialing
in on a phone line from home
or a CIS lab.

Stieman stresses that
although Pitt is involved in the
development and investiga-
tion of this project, it has not
yet been integrated into the
University.

He also maintains that
Internet 2 is not _a replacement
for Pitt's current system;
rather, it is an entirely differ-
ent system.

“We would be remiss in
not signing up for this impor-
tant project," said Dr.
Stieman.

SGB to make extra funds
available to student groups

Alan Blitz
For The Pitt News

"The SGB will be making approxi-
mately $100,000 available to student
groups for computers and other expensive
equipment that normally would be reject-
ed by the Allocations Committee.

This was announced at the SGB
meeting on Oct. 22 by Brian Riemer,
SGB business manager and board mem-
ber, and will be implemented soon.

"The alleged $6,000 embezzlement
[by former Allocations Chairman Gerald
Klayman] will not affect, to any large
degree, the distribution of funds to stu-
dent groups," said Riemer. "Historically,
about $90,000 goes unspent and rolls
over to the next semester."

Riemer estimates that the SGB's bud-
get exceeds $100,000 this semester.

Riemer commented that for student
groups to qualify for the excess funds, the
organization must have an office on carn-
pus and be in need of the equipment.
However, not every student group can
apply.

Organizations must be active during
this semester and have previously con-
ducted fomial meetings. Second, student
groups must be included on the

Allocation Committee's list of approved

organizations, meaning graduate and
CGS student groups are not eligible.

"The investigation of student groups
is now beyond the SGB and allocations,
beyond the Office of Student Activities,"
said Riemer. "Now they [student groups]
will answer to the Office of the
Chancellor and the board of trustees."

A The Allocations Committee is not
responsible for deciding which student
groups are eligible for funding, but only
how available funds are distributed to
those campus organizations.

Student groups eligible for the extra
funding will be notiﬁed by mail early
next week. Riemer estimates that as many
as 20 student organizations will apply for
new computers or expensive equipment.

"We need travel funding to attend
events and seminars to learn more about
the organizations, such as the United
Cearebral Disorder and Iodine Deﬁciency
Disorder, we do service for," said Bob
Lorence, president of Circle K
International.

This is the first time that funds of this
nature are openly available to student
organizations, according to Riemer. He
also said this is the current SGB's last
chance to leave oﬁice in a positive light.
The SGB members’ tenure ends with this
semester.

DalMolin ”trivializing” search process, says committee chair

Kris Kissel
contrlbutlng Edltor

Edward Stricker, chair of the
search committee for the new FAS
dean, said he was disturbed to read
SGB President Justin DalMolin's com-
ments in yesterday's Pitt News about
the dean selection process.

"It's interesting for me to read him
comment on a process he hasn't partic-
ipated in," said Stricker.

DalMolin, who was appointed to
the search committee in March but has
not participated since April, said that
everything up to now has been "just
logistics, narrowing the group down
and soforth. The real decision -making

‘comes now." ’

But according to Stricker, what
has gone on so far has been of the
utmost importance.

"He's trivializing it," said Striker.

DalMolin also had claimed that he
would allow SGB member David

Teeters to replace him on the commit-
tee now, but Stricker says that is not
going to happen.

"DalMolin is not in
power to replace him-
self on the committee,"
Stricker said. "Only the
provost decides who, if
anyone, is the replace-
ment."

Stricker added that
the provost had decided
two months ago not to
replace DalMolin on the
committee, and that
once the committee
realized DalMolin was
not participating, too
much had already hap-
pened.

Instead, candidates
for FAS dean will meet with a group
of undergraduate ‘students over lunch
during their separate 48-hour visits to
Pitt over the next five weeks. Stricker

He said

asked David Brumble, the associate

dean of the FAS for undergraduate
studies, and G. Alec Stewart, dean of
the University Honors
College, to submit
names of students to
meet with the candi-
dates.

All students and facul-
ty who wish to meet the
candidates will be invit-
ed to do so at open
forums that will be held
during their 48-hour
campus visits.

Still, undergraduates
will have no direct
input on the selection
process. These students
will meet with the can-
didates merely for dis-
cussion. ’

Teeters, who said he would have
liked to sit on the committee as an
undergraduate representative, called

this a "very unfortunate situation" and
said he wishes things had gone differ-
ently. He said Da1Molin should have
taken this responsibility more serious-
ly. ~
"The image of the Student
Government Board at this University
sucks, and it's for reasons like this,"
Teeters said. "This is an academic
issue that SGB should be concerned
with, and the fact that the ball was
dropped is a sorry reflection on the
state of SGB."

Teeters- went on to say that the
selection of. a new dean is one of the
most interesting, exciting and impor-
tant issues now facing Pitt, and that
student input is essential for some-
thing of this magnitude.

"We're talking about shaping the
University in a significant way over
the next generation of students," he
said. "Of all the things SGB might
have done wrong this semester, drop-
ping the ball here is the worst one."

Operation Santa Claus will be
taking donations next week

Christal Hall
Staff Writer

Blue and Gold Society will be
sponsoring its annual Christmas
time fund raiser, Operation Santa
Claus, to collect gifts for the mem-
bers of Family House.

Family House offers housing to
family members of people confined
to a hospital for the Christmas sea-
son. According to Julie Claycomb,
co-chairperson of Operation Santa
Claus, Family House offers “an
inexpensive way of staying close to
your loved ones without spending
money on costly hotels.”

Michelle Safarik, a committee
member, said there are currently
three different Family Houses in
Pittsburgh: one on McKee Street,
one on North Neville Street and
another within Montefiore Hospital.

"Operation Santa Claus is a
great way to brighten the holiday
season for the people of Family
House,” Claycomb said. “The Blue
and Gold Society is really excited."

According to Claycomb, the
Blue and Gold Society's goal is to
get 700 gifts for the people using
Family House.

Claycomb said everyone is wel-
come to donate gifts to the organiza-
tion. Students may come to any of
the tables from Monday, Nov.17, to
Friday, Nov. 21, between 10. a.m.
and 2 p.m.

The tables will be set up in the
Cathedral of Learning Commons
Room, the William Pitt Union lower
level, the Towers lobby, and Scaife
Hall’s Cafeteria. ,

At the collection table, students
will tell an Operation Santa Claus
worker what gift they plan on giv-
ing, and will receive a tree ornament
with the name of the gift on it.

According to Claycomb, most
gift givers spend between $5 and
$10.

. Claycomb said once the student
purchases the gift, they should wrap
it, with the ornament on top, and
turn it in to Operation Santa Claus
at the Union’s‘ lower level or Scaife
Cafeteria on Dec. 1 or 2, between 10
a.m. and 2 p.m.

After the gifts are collected,
they are distributed to the Family
House centers.

Claycomb added that monetary
gifts are accepted at all of the
tables.

On Dec. 4, the members of the
Blue and Gold Society will spend
the night with the people of Family
House.

Claycomb encourages individ-
ual organizations to give donations
to Operation Santa Claus. She said
to contact the Alumni Association,
students should stop by the office on
the third floor of Craig Hall and
leave their name and phone number
by Tuesday, Nov. 18. A

One-time SGB candidate chides
current board for trip to Florida

Anthony Breznlcan
Edltor-In-Chlof

Student Government Board mem- .

bers defended their plans last night for
a $3,000 late-term trip to a convention
in Disney World, saying the board is
"not on a negative greedy rampage."

Narrowly defeated SGB candidate
Joe Gielata forced the meeting to
reopen so he could criticize the trip
after current board members held it
more than a half hour before its regu-
larly scheduled time.

Newly elected board members and
President-elect Alyson Wallach soon
ﬁled into the conference room, as SGB
President Justin DalMolin agreed to
reopen the meeting to discuss the trip.

DalMolin will attend the service
conference at the end of the month with
Brandi Miller, Brian Riemer and
Marquette Bowman, just two weeks
before their terms essentially end.

The convention will only pay for
the $329 registration fee. The group
will hold seminars advising other stu-
dent governments about "the excep-
tional student run allocations process"
at Pitt, improving a student government
image, and how to achieve shared gov-
ernance between students and
University administrators.

Pitt's student activity funds will
pay for their food, travel and lodging
—— amounting to $2,767.

"We have a lot to offer the students
in Florida and around the country," said

Miller, who claimed many student
groups send seniors to conventions,
even though they have little time to use
that information to improve the group.

"How is this supposed to help me,
as a student? You people are leaving,"
Gielata told the board. "I can only say
to the incoming president that I hope
this kind of thing doesn't happen again.
I hope you distinguish yourself from
these actions."

Gielata also said he extended his
"sympathies" to the rest of the incom-
ing board for "the mess" created by the
current board.

Board member Christa Douaihy
took issue with his statements, saying
she was tired of her colleagues‘ names
"being dragged through the mud."

An angry Douaihy apologized that
the meeting was held early, but said this
was done because she is suffering from
pneumonia and hoped to go home
early.

"It wasn't some devious little secret
meeting bullshit," she said. »

Wrapped in a scarf and winter coat,
Douaihy then stood from the confer-
ence table and walked to the edge of the
room, saying she was about to speak
"not as an SGB member" but as an indi-
vidual.

"These people are students, not
demons who want to take over the
world," she said of. the other SGB
members. "We're not trying to steal
money. We're not on some negative

greedy rampage.”

Across the Nation

NEW CASTLE, Pa. —- U.S. News &
World Report settled a lawsuit yester-
day by a Lawrence County business-
man who was named in the magazine
as having organized-crime ties.

The terms of the settlement were
kept conﬁdential.

The businessman, Angelo Medure,
owns a paving business and also is
chief executive officer of Gaming
World International, which sets up
casinos on Native American land.

In an article in 1993 entitled
"Gambling With the Mob," the maga-
zine linked Medure to organized crime.

Medure sued, saying he lost mil-
lions of dollars as a result.

A jury trial started last week in
New Castle and was interrupted yester-
day morning with the announcement of
the settlement.

Attorneys for both sides say they
are happy.

DENTON, Texas — Some young
cheerleaders outside Dallas are caught
in the middle of a fight over the
"Barbie Girl" song. The kids won't be

allowed to use the song in their compe-
tition on Saturday because some offi-
cials in the youth football league say
it's too racy. The cheerleaders’ coach
says they have been dancing to the
song for a year. She says they've only
had a week to learn new moves just
because "some freaked-out parents said
the song is too suggestive." Some of
the lyrics to the song are: "You can
brush my hair / undress me every-
where" and "kiss me here / touch me
there / hanky—panky." The cheerleaders
are four to six years old.

Students should have
input on clean selection

Undergraduates are going to have no input at all
on the selection of a new dean of FAS. Justin DalMolin
has neglected his opportunity to represent students — to
“share governance” as he likes to boast about doing -
by not participating in a single meeting of the dean
search committee to which he was appointed.

We, as students, must communicate what we
know is important to the candidates themselves.

Each candidate will separately be visiting Pitt
for a 48-hour stint over three days sometime in the next
few weeks. While here, they will host open forums for
the public to meet them, probably in a venue like the
William Pitt Union Ballroom.The Pitt News will
announce those forums when they are officially sched-
uled. A
We strongly urge every undergraduate student,
not just from CAS but from every school, to attend and
make their voices heard.

Without input from students, candidates for
clean may come to the wrong conclusion that Pitt is a
research institution.

It is not.

Pitt is a research university, which is very dif-
ferent. Pitt isn’t a commercial-industrial institution just
trying to invent the better mousetrap.'But at a second-

‘tier university like Pitt, all the research-oriented faculty

are trying to keep up with the pace-setters at places like
Harvard and MIT. Sometimes our administrators --

'who are often ex-second tier university-faculty-

researchers themselves —— can forget how important
undergraduate education is to this place. ,
Student tuition is the single largest source of

income Pitt has.

Pitt’s purpose includes, to a great degree, edu-
cating thousands of students, many of whom will never
publish a single paper in Physical Review Letters or a
single research monograph on the history"of ancient
Aztec courting rituals. Does that make students second-
class citizens with Pitt?

Let’s hope not.

In fact, let’s make sure that it doesn’t. Let’s tell
the candidates what we’ll demand of them if they’re
appointed dean. Let’s make them tell us what they’re
going to do to make Pitt a place where students can get
a first-rate education.

Because without students, there would be no
research going on here at all.

SGB campaigns were less than original

' Paul

Clark

“It is a choice between evils

and I am going to shut my eyes, hold
my nose, vote, go home, and disin-
fect mysef” — And so I voted in
the SGB elections as Grover
Cleveland voted in the 1900 presi-
dential election Only tliree board
candidates promoted speciﬁc plans
to actually reform the allocations
process — deemed the issue of
greatest ' via this sum-
mer’s possibly criminal, and at the
very least, unethical spending. The
wild outcome of this election poses
some question fortlie 1,997 students
with a pulse who voteck What hap-
penedtotheGargoyles?Why, ina
fall marked by outrage over SGB
comtption, was diere such a low
turnout? And exactly what shouki
we expect this new SGB to accom-
plish?

Most conscious observers’ of
this election hadpredicted the pair of
Gargoyles, Damon Hudac and Joe
Gielata, to garner rmybe as much as
two-thirds of the vote. Virtually
everyone thought their election to
SGB wasagiven.Aftera]l,theylmd
dominated The Pitt News, had an
extensive grass roots campaign, and
communicated effectively to the
average student who wasn’t actively
involved or didn’t quite care. Plus,
they boasted the greatest name
recognition and an exciting, out-
landish platform I’m sure Joe and
Damon are asking -—-— What the Hell
Happened?!? Why didn’t we both
win by landslides?!? .

First, many students, especially
those who already worked in some
capacity with student government,
did not take the two seriously. Some
even took offense to them, interpret-

ingthepairasanattackontliedig-
nity of SGB.

Second, grass roots carnpaign—
ing only works when the people tar-
geted actually vote. Students already
inactive and not compelled to partic-
ipate in student organizations, athlet-
ics or other affairs were not motivat-
ed to vote either. Not only did the
Gargoyles spend most of their time
campaigning to nonvoters, but they
failedtoattractthosewhoDIDv'ote
-4 active members of strident orga-
nizations.

By refusing the endorsements
and allegiances of a few groups, the
Gargoyles sought the support of all
groups. This backﬁred when the
vast rmjority of thernerribers of stu-
dent organizations voted their
respective endorsement lines.
Ultimately, the Gargoyles’ separa-
tion ﬁom the main bloc of voters,
the student organizations, killed
their election chances.

While the majority of voters
were already involved in student
orgamzations, when considering the

' widespread discontent with the cur-

rent board’s illicit spending and self-
serving trips, dinners, etc., why did
85 percent of students not vote?

No current board members
were running (except for David
Teeters). Student voters were
deprived of the opportunity to retal-
iate, punish, and vote against those
arrogant, overspendirig board mem-
bers.Withtheguaranteeofa‘ w”

Someone called someone else a big
fat liar, which isn’t such ‘ a big deal if

you’re in kindergarten, but it is a big deal-

if you’re the U.S. secretary of state or the
Iraqi prime minister. Emblazoned on the
front of every self—respecting newspaper
in the nation yesterday was the headline
that ﬁghtin’ words have been swapped
between our nation and that mean, germ-
warfare-capable gas station in the Gulf.
(So there.) I

It all started on Sunday when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called President Saddam Hussein a “con-

- genital liar,” which isnlt so bad because

the term liar was coupled with the term
“congeni ,” which qualiﬁes as an oﬂi-,
cial big-people’s word. In an article in
yesterday’s New York Times, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was
quoted as saying, “Those who accuse the
others of being liars, they are liars.” And
when a reporter asked Aziz to clarify
whether he meant Albright was a liar, he
responded by saying, ‘~‘I hoped she
wouldn’t be, but unfortrmately she is.”

Where have I heard that before?

I know you’re a liar, but what am I?
Am not. Are too. Am not. Are too, inﬁni-
ty  I win, I win.

If this is politics as usual for the
Middle East, then life may as well go
back to the good old days of day care —-
the days when no one realized Barbie and
Ken were horribly deprived of their
anatomical correctness and the biggest
tragedy was the day the G.I. Joes got too
close to the radiator and melted into a

THE PITT NEWS

blob of green and brown
plastic, with a helmet. Afte
all, the state of world affair
isn’t all that different from
life at Kinder—Kare.

The Iraqis are those
kids whohogged the sand-
box and touted the fact tha

they have the only juice box of orange-

ﬂavored drink anyone in day care ever
successfully snuck out of snack time. Led
by that big bully, Sandbox Saddam, the
Iraqi kids jump around and make a lot of
noise to get everyone’s attention, then sit
down and stick out their tongues as they
wave their dart guns around.

The Americans, chasing their leader,
Billy, around the room after he pinched a
girl on the bum and supposedly accepting
lunch money for television remote con-
trol favors; the Chinese kids (all boys,
mind you) playing colonial dress up and
folding paper airplanes out of copies of
the Constitution as they claim to have dis-
covered a practical use for the document;
and the Europeans — who just can’t
seem to ﬁgure out how to trade their
candy among each other fairly —-— all stop
what they’re doing and watch.

Tensions are still high since the
American kids came over and beat the
living daylights out of Saddam for a juice
box, and nothing’s really been the same

since. T'hey’re still picking out the pulp .
’ Kleenex and waves it in the air in front of

from the sand. ’

Their day care supervisor, inthis case
U.N. Secretary General Koﬁ Annan,
stemly tells everybody to stop and then

 
   
   
  
  
 
  
   
 

walks out of the room
muttering something
about ‘”To your respec-
tive equivalent of hell
with the rapscallions.”
And the kids know they
Corummsr have control of the
room. ,

So now the name calling starts. Billy
pulls out the G.I. Joes and says he knows
Saddam has been hiding water bombs
from everybody. “No, I’m not,” says
Hussein, quickly shoving an empty bal-
loon hanging out of his pocket into hid-
ing. . .

Next thing you know, all the Iraqi
kids are jumping out of the back of the
sandbox and running into the closet (car-
rying armfuls of something that makes
sloshing noises as they jog), and the
shouting really gets going. He turns
around and makes all the non-Iraqi kids
get out of the sandbox and makes sure the
whole room knows that his juice box is
still there. All of a sudden, everything
falls quiet as a paper airplane drifts silent-
ly past the sandbox and settles on the
ﬂoor by Billy’s G.I. Joes. Saddam picks
up a block and everybody ducks for cover
except Billy and his gang, who have just
returned from ﬁlling ‘up their own water
bombs and stand with them in their
hands. .

Just then Saddam pulls out a dirty

everybody —-— and now everybody is

ready to wet their pants. “Look, just

throw that away, Saddam,” says Billy.

EXPLANATION

Democracy is a strange animal.
Such a sentiment was once more
evinced by the outcome realized by the
1,997 voters of the 1997 SGB elec-
tions. An election distinguished espe-
cially by the Gargoyle Slate —— a party
comprised of two individuals —-— who,
in strict defiance of convention,
refused endorsements from SGB—fund—

— ed organizations, neglected to focus on

any particular group (whether ‘Greeks
or blacks or chicks), and, due to their
admittedly anarchist bent, declined to
wholeheartedly champion federal aid
for students. Indeed, their deﬁance of
convention extended beyond the issues
into the campaign itself ——- a “guerilla
campaign” inaugurated by the Rooftop
Speech and epitomized by the ﬁre-
breathing of Flarnin’ Damon Hudac.
This was “cowboy politics,” no doubt,
and, though I barely lost, I'm proud to
have been part of it.

UNDERSTANDING
SGB has always been lame in fact

 

andin spirit; the Gargoyle Slate was an
effort to change that, and the measure
of our success or failure is thus an
interesting endeavor. The partial victo-
ry of the election isn’t an adequate
gauge because it seemed like the peo-
ple who voted were mostly the people
who had always voted; furthermore,
the Gargoyles were huge recipients of
negative campaigning, and it’s likely
that we would have received more
votes (I lost by only 23 votes, after all)
were it not for the efforts of those
including Paul McKrell, whose
University Democrats endorsement
message called the Gargoyles “mon—
sters” and “pure evil” while maligning
our intentions with invented quotes.
Alas, sincerity doesn’t pay; there were
those who would have crucified us for
the honesty and clarity of our state-
ments.

Our effort to inﬂuence the form of
campaigning can be regarded as a fail-
ure. Other candidates continued to rely
on conventional tactics (the lame
ﬂiers, the lame banners, the lame
posters — a lameness matched in the
objectives themselves), and this elec-
tion may be considered as much a joke

A Gargoyle reflects on an election well lost

as any other. I consider myself respon-
sible (note to SGB: this is accountabil-
ity) for not doing enough; i.e., the
Gargoyles should have made more
public speeches and spoken on more
shuttles and perhaps Damon should
have used more butane.

Regardless, there is now one
Gargoyle “inside” and another “out-
side.” That’s not the worst of the possi-
ble outcomes. Will SGB continue to be
lame? Probably, but not necessarily.

' For instance, the policy of silence so

dear to the present SGB is in danger
because, ironically enough, Gargoyles
tend to be noisy.

V It ought to be mentioned, ﬁnally,
that regardless of the vote count, the
Gargoyles campaigned on their own
terms; thus understood, my loss was a
kind of victory. Ultimately, it’s my
hope that students will remember this
election as the one where, though little
really happened, at least the Gargoyles
gave it a shot.

Joe Gielata can be seen watching over
Pitt’s campus with a stone-like
demeanor while perched atop the

Perhaps we wouldn't fear war if our leaders would grow up

“You know  I love you, man.” The
French kids put down their brown
baguette snacks, grab the Russian kids
(who are still sharing their really old toys
and are reportedly selling their water bal-
loons to get candy) and sort of gather
around the sandbox, eyeing up the dirty
Kleenex. J c I

And this is where the world stands.
Forttmately, no one is hurt, yet. But, the
recent banter has degenerated the look of
the global state of aﬂairs into that of an
austere political playground, and it’s only
getting. worse. The real Saddam isn’t
holding a block; he’s holding warehouses
full of ballistic missiles and nuclear
weapons. His snotty Kleenex is holding
an arsenal of chemical-biological
weaponry.

Unless Annan steps in immediately
and drags Hussein out of the room by his
ear and sends him home for good, people
are going to die on a tangential scale
when he lets ﬂy those freeze-dried bio-
logical spores into the atmosphere. And
Hussein won’t care if he gets killed —-
there are no political gains to be made by
pushing the United States and the United
Nations around other than to say that he
did it — for he'll have made his point.

More than just ”respect"

away from Big East title

Piit football three wins

Matt Townsend

I Assistant Sports Editor

At the end of Wednesday’s football
practice, Pitt Athletics Director Steve
Pederson addressed the team on the 20-yard
line under the lights of Pitt Stadium

1 The players knelt on one knee as they
focused on the man who’s role has been
deﬁned as Pitt’s savior. He did not want to
discuss what he told the team, but hinted at
it being a “let’s ﬁnish the season strong”
speech. 5 .

‘This team worked hard to get respect
and I wanted to see it continue,” said
Pederson.

Respect?

Pitt (4-4) hasn’t had an even record this
late in the season since 1991, when it ﬁn-
ished 6-5 under Paul Hackett. Pitt is also the
only team in the Big East that controls its
own destiny. Meaning that if Pitt, at 2-2 in
the Big East right now, beats Syracuse on
Saturday, Virginia Tech the next week and is
victorious in Morgantown in two weeks,

they will take home the Big East
Championship.

“We haven’t been in a real conference
race in quite a while, so that is their motiva-
tion for this game,” said Head Coach Walt
Hanis. -

The only possible change in Pitt’s depth
chart is on special teams. Holder Joe
Holland could be replaced by second string
ﬂanker Andy Molinaro.

“We’ve been auditioning different peo-
ple on special teams all week,” said Hanis.
“Molinaro may be the holder, but that deci-
sion hasn’t been made yet.”

The kicking game has been a side
cramp in Pitt’s gut all season.

Against Boston College a ﬁeld goal
attempt was botched and later a Grant
Coﬂield punt was blocked, which led to a
quick Eagle touchdown drive.

“It’s a problem for us,” said Hanis. “I
believe in Chris Ferencik, I think he is good
enough. Grant Cofﬁeld has struggled a little
bit, but his kick—offs that sail into the end

Gonzalez ranks at the top of the conference, but finishes behind Donovan McNabb.

Orangemen bring six-game win streak to Pitt Stadium  

Shannon Heim

Staff Writer

On Saturday, the Syracuse
Orangemen will travel to
Pittsburgh to take on the
Panthers and continue
Syracuse’s A longest-running
football rivalry. With both

-teams having talented signal

callers, this game could
become a contest between
Syracuse’s junior quarterback
Donovan McNabb and the
Panthers’ senior quarterback,
Pete Gonzalez.

Syracuse Head Coach Paul
Pasqualoni said that “having
these two very talented quar-
terbacks is going to make the
game exciting for the fans.
These are two guys that can
really throw. Donovan is a
very gifted guy, he’s very ath-
letic. He has a great sense of
knowing where his receivers
are.” ,

McNabb has certainly
lived up to his coach’s expec-
tations this season. He leads
the Big East in pass efficiency
with 119 completions out of
216 attempts. With a total of

2,108 yards and 16
touchdowns, his
pass efficiency per-
centage is 156.9.
Pitt quarterback
Gonzalez has also
performed extremely
well this year, rank-
ing third in the Big
East in pass efficien-
cy. Gonzalez has

‘completed 141 out

of 250 attempts, and
has thrown 19 touch-
downs with only
four interceptions.
His pass efficiency
rating is 138.6.

Pitt Head Coach
Walt Harris dis-
agrees with the idea
of the game as being
a battle 19 between
quarterbacks. He
said, “I don’t think
that Pete is in a
matchup. He is just
trying to throw com-
pletions.”

To counter
Pittsburgh’s Mad

Dog defense, McNabb and his equally aggressive game plan.

Outpaced in the Heisman race, McNabb is now
focused on winning a Big East title for Syracuse.

For The Pitt News

As a high school football
player, Darnell “D.J.” Dinkins
piled up accolades almost as
fast as he piled up total
yardage. He was a three year
starter at quarterback, he was
named the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette City League Player of .

-the Year and he led Schenley

High School to the City
League Championship game
for the first time since 1950.

His senior season, in
which he passed for 1,127
yards and rushed for 422
yards, saw him move into the
upper echelon of high school
athletes, and there were many
colleges that pursued him.

How lucky the Pittsburgh
Panthers were, then, when he
decided to stay home and help
them turn their football pro-
gram around. This gifted ath-
lete with an incredibly strong
throwing arm was going to be
the Panther quarterback of the
future.

Or so it seemed.

After sitting out the 1995
season as a redshirt, it became
apparent that Dinkins’ size (6-

He feels his time at safety
willnot be detrimental to his
quest for the starting quarter-

is important, and playingdif-

that.”

Unfortunately for Dinkins,
his “dream of quarterbacking
in the Super Bowl” may never

what the team’s long—range
plans for Dinkins are, Coach
Harris said that “He will be
playing on defense until we
recruit someone better.”

Will he be given another
chance at quarterback this

“No.”

For now, Dinkins is con-
tent to do whatever possible to
help the team. He has been
seeing a little more time at
free safety and has also been a
contributor to special teams.

To date, he has recorded
36 tackles for the Panthers,

wagon because

“it’s the coolest.”

From that point on everyone,
including the senile tour guide, peed
their pants freely, and everyone went
on to live happily ever after. 2

Therein lies an ingenious concept.

Doing something embarrassing
and immature and coming out on the
winning end as a result.

What a win-win situation.

Maybe that’s just what a couple of
football Pittsburgh Panthers were

thinking as they head out to tackle

their must-win-win—win situation.
Some may think tight end Kirk

McMullen and defensive back Victor

Strader have given the Panthers a

, black eye, but it’s really a blessing in

disguise.

Think about it. What do
Nebraska, Miami, Florida State and
Florida all have in common?

They are consistently, with the
recent exception of the Hurricanes, at
the top of the college football world,
year in and year out.

It looks like a
fun week in college
football. There are a
few teams that are
certain to score tons
of points, which is
always entertain-
ing. Fortunately for . 
you, two of those teams will be playing
just a few blocks up Cardiac Hill 

Syracuse at Pitt (+19)

Here are two teams headed in exact-
ly opposite directions. The Orangemen
are the same old Orangemen they always
have been. They choked early in the year,
like they do every year, but are currently
riding a six game winning streak. Pitt
started the season 3-1, but is 1-3 since,
with the only victory being an embar-
rassingly close overtime win against the
sorry Scarlet Knights of Rutgers. Sure, if
Pitt wins its remaining three games, it’s
going to an alliance bowl — but get real.
Pitt will not win this game. You should
still go to the game, though, because the
scoreboard is going to get lit up like a
Christmas tree. Syracuse 51, Pitt 38

Auburn (+6) at Georgia

Here are two more teams going in
opposite directions. It may be hard to
believe this now, but Auburn was 6-0 just
four weeks ago. Meanwhile, Georgia has
stormed into first place in the SEC
behind the play of Mike Bobo, who is the
top ranked quarterback in the conference
— and this is the conference that
includes Peyton Manning and Tim
Couch. Normally, you could look for a
letdown the week after a team beats
Florida, but the Bulldogs and their fans,
who should play a big part in this game,
know that there is a lot at stake here.
Georgia 31, Auburn 21 -

Penn State at Purdue (+6)

Michigan is hardly an offensive
powerhouse, but its offense still made the
Nittany Lion defense look pathetic last
week. Yes, Purdue has been in an offen-
sive lull lately, but ‘Penn State’s defense
should cure that. Just imagine what the
Boilermakers, probably the best offense
Penn State has played yet, are going to
do. I’ll tell you what Purdue is going to
do -— it’s going to do the same thing that
Syracuse and Pitt are going to do, and
that is score. Often. .

Purdue 45, Penn State 24

Washington (+2) at UCLA

The Bruins are the forgotten team in
the Pac 10. With all the noise rrrade over
Washington, Washington State and
Arizona State, people seem to have for-
gotten that UCLA also has a pretty darn
good shot at the Rose Bowl. UCLA leads
the nation in turnover margin, which is a

fairly underrated
statistic. UCLA’s
offense is plenty
good enough to
win this game, and
if Washington’s
oft-injured quarter-
back Brock Huard
can’t play the whole game, UCLA’s
defense is capable of forcing the Huskies
to make enough. mistakes to lose.
UCLA 37, Washington 24

Michigan at Wisconsin (+15)

The Wolverines sure looked like the
nation’s best team last week. Michigan
could probably beat several NFL teams.
As for Wisconsin, don’t be deceived by
its 8-2 record. “Wisconsin has won more
than its share of really close games this
year, and several of those were against
absolutely terrible teams (Boise State
and Indiana come to mind). VV1sconsin is
nowhere near Michigan’s level. It’s hard
to bill a game as something like David
vs. Goliath when your “David” team is
ranked No. 23 in the country, but if I
were Wisconsin, I’d bring my slingshot.
Michigan 28, Wisconsin 7

Louisiana Tech at Southwestern
Louisiana (+24)

Remember the Ragin’ Cajuns? The
team that Pitt knocked all over the turf
back in August? The Cajuns looked pret-
ty bad then, but nobody could have real-
ized exactly how bad Southwestern
Louisiana would be. The Cajuns have a
very good chance to break the NCAA
Division I—A record for the most points
allowed in a season. In 10 games, they
have given up 490 points. The record is
544 points, an average of 49.5 per game,
by UTEP in 1973. Mercifully, this is the
last game of the season for the Cajuns.
Will the record fall? Well, Louisiana

Tech ﬁgures to hold up its end of the bar— .

gain.
Louisiana Tech 55, Southwestern
Louisiana 17

This Week’s Best Bet:
Rice at Utah (+1)

You’d think Utah has to hit bottom
sometime. It hasn’t scored more than 20
points in a game since September. And it
probably won’t this week, either. Utah
does have the WAC’s best defense, but
Utah hasn’t faced anything like Rice’s
running game. Rice’s running game is
second in the nation,’ behind only
Nebraska, and that ﬁgures to keep Utah’s
offense off the ﬁeld for most of the game.

zone have given our defense and added
lift. Hopefully, we’ll perform on
Saturday.”

 repeatedly talked about execu-
tion, and on Saturday aftemoon Pitt will
have to execute Donovan McNabb if they
have any prayer of pulling out the win.

“He is one of the best players in the
league,” said Hanis. “He’s the fastest and
the biggest quarterback we’ll play.”

9 McNabb is just behind Pitt quarter-
back Pete Gonzalez with 210.8 yards pass-
ing a game in the Big East and has already
thrown for 2,108 yardsthis season. Last
week the junior broke Marvin Graves’
career touchdown passes mark with 51.

Syracuse runs a multiple offense out
of multiple formations, and McNabb is at
the center of it all. At times, they can
become a run—oriented team with 6-3, 250-
pound Rob Konrad trampling or hurdling
over defenders. But, when the middle is
being stopped, the Orangemen turn to the
option with McNabb and munchkin tail-
back Kyle McIntosh (5-8, 178 pounds).

“We just have to keep him [McNabb]
olf the ﬁeld,” said Hanis. “We have to con-
trol some of the other guys in order to cor-

, ral him.”

Corralling McNabb will be strenuous
because Syracuse’s offensive line averages
almost 50 pounds more than Pitt’s. The
Orange also run the option, which gave the
Panthers ﬁts in their only match-up against

it this year. A little over a month ago the

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 10

Temple Owls tortured the Panthers for 225
yards rushing mainly with the option.

“Against Temple they subbed in their 1

running quarterback, so it was a little easi-
er than it will be this week,” said Hanis.
“We just have to execute on defense.”

In the past two games Pitt has put up
god—like yards of offense. Gonzalez threw
for 470 yards against Temple and running
back Dwayne Schulters has rushed for
over 300 yards combined in the past two
games.

Gonzalez and company have the best
passing offense in the Big East. His 19

touchdowns this season are third all—time .

in Pitt history behind Panther greats Alex
Van Pelt (20) and Dan Marino (37).
Something obviously will have to give on

Saturday. Pitt’s 425.5 average yards a

game is up against a Syracuse defense that
gives up only 290 yards a contest.

“We will try to mix it up on offense
and continue the way we’ve been coming
together,” said Harris.

Panther Notes:

-Billy West needs just 61 yards to pass
Curtis Martin and into ﬁfth place on Pitt’s
all time rushing list.

-The Panthers’ new offense has
almost doubled last year’s touchdown pass
total of 11 with 20 this season.

-Pete Gonzalez needs 208 passing
yards to be the ﬁrst Pitt quarterback to
throw for 2,000 yards in a season since
Van Pelt’s school record of 3,163 in 1992.

SYRACUSE

the Orangemen are “playing pretty
good defense.” ‘

Pasqualoni continued, “When we
started playing Tebucky Jones at strong
safety, he had never played the position
before. Our defense is aggressive. The
players need to get used to each other,
though.” .

Tebucky Jones has definitely got-
ten used to his position as Syracuse’s
strong safety. In Syracuse’s last two
games, Jones has compiled 24 tackles,
three pass breakups and two forced
fumbles.

Jones was named Big East and East
Coast Athletic Conference Defensive
Player of the Week for his efforts in the
West Virginia game, and repeated as
ECAC Defensive Player of the Week
for his play in the Boston College con-
test. Also, Jones sealed Syracuse’s win
over Tulane with a 98-yard interception
return for a touchdown.

Also contributing to the defensive
line is Will Allen, a redshirt freshman.
In the Boston College victory, Allen
caught and tackled the Eagles’ Mike
Cloud on the Syracuse 23-yard line,
stopping a would-be BC touchdown.

Another defensive player to watch
for is senior inside linebacker
Antwaune Ponds. As a starter last sea-
son, Ponds recorded 90 tackles and 5.5
sacks. He has totaled 323 tackles in his
career. In 1996, Ponds was named to

the All-Big East second team and
Associated Press All-American third
team.

Leading the Orangemen secondary
is senior Donovin Darius. Darius has
caught a team-high six interceptions
for a total of 56 yards.

Statistically, the Syracuse
Orangemen have had an impressive
season. The team leads the Big East in
scoring offense, pass defense, kickoff
returns, turnover margin, total offense,
punt returns, passing efficiency, first
downs and third down conversions.
Syracuse leads in scoring offense by 14
touchdowns, with a total of 48.

Coach Harris assessed this
Syracuse team by noting “They are
loaded with physical athletes that are
big, tough and fast.”

He added, “They have as big of a
secondary as we have seen.”

Syracuse’s Pasqualoni has never
lost to the Pittsburgh Panthers. He said,
“We’re going to go in and see what we
can do against a very aggressive
Pittsburgh defense. Their scheme is
different — they move their fronts
more and they blitz. Those kids play
hard and run the football well.”

Overall, Pittsburgh leads the
Panther—Orangemen series 25-24-1.
But in Saturday’s matchup, the
Orangemen hope to add a seventh con-
secutive win to even the series.

DINKINS

during the Panthers’ second game at
Houston when he intercepted a pass in
the end zone to thwart a late Cougar
drive.

It is that type of big play that the
Panthers need now more than ever.
The Panthers will close out the season
with successive games against the Big
East’s top three teams starting when
Syracuse visits Pitt Stadium this
Saturday.

If the Panthers win at least two of
their three remaining games (the other
two games are home against Virginia
Tech and at West Virginia, respective-
ly), they will qualify for their first
bowl game since 1989, a prospect that
excites Dinkins, as well as the rest of
the Panthers.

“We’ve been losing close games,
and we’d like to win two out of the
three. It would be a big, big thing for
me to go to a bowl game this early in
my career.”

Wherever that career may take
him.

‘Hallelujah, everlasting light

Thanks to McMullen and

the ESPN attention it has longed for.

Sure, it may not be positive
attention, but we’re getting noticed
nonetheless.

Prospective recruits across the
country probably saw how the

ravage some innocent noses, or com-

assured a good chance of getting off

fans don’t want to see their program
in the dark.

And there has been such little
light shining on the Panthers in the
‘90s. . '

Anyone who thinks that any
Division I football program is
squeaky clean is behind the times.

Not even, gulp, blessed Penn
State. .

It’s just not realistic to think that
all coaches walk the straight and nar-
row, but it seems like Walt Harris has
made an honest effort to do so since
he marched into town.

Harris has disciplined his players
for off-the-field antics that have put
the lives of other students in danger.

Some may think too lightly, but
it’s discipline nonetheless.

The fate of these players is
“pending investigation,” but the
future of the entire program is look-
ing great.

Even if Pittsburgh finishes 4-7,
no one can say that this team is any-
thing like last year’s team, or any in
recent memory for that matter.

Slipups against Temple and

15

Boston College will be distant mem-
ories once Harris gets the chance to
bring in his handpicked talent.

We will see more and more
moments like the September To
Remember when we upset Miami,
the huge plays we made to stiﬂe
Houston, and the afternoon we made
Penn State look human.

Don’t count the Panthers out as
they enter a brutal home stretch.

Syracuse, Virginia Tech and
West Virginia have all been beaten
and are probably looking past
Pittsburgh to prospective bowl bids.

The chances of Pittsburgh down-
ing all three aren’t good.

In fact, they’re pretty bad. But
stranger things have happened.

Whoever thought peeing your
pants and breaking the law would
ever actually help people rise to
prominence?

Matt Grove is a columnist for
The Pitt News, and ‘if Pittsburgh
wins out, he will publicly pee his
pants and turn to a life of senseless
crime against people half his size.
