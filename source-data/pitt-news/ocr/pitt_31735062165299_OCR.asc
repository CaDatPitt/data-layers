Ronald Sobel Named

As Council President

By AL DONALSON *

Ron Sobel, Col. ’57, was elected president of Men’s Coun-

cil last Thursday evening at the Fairfax Hotel. Three of the

four All-Pitt representatives in Council voted for Sobel, who

had the support of the l0—vote Panther Party bloc, to en-

I able the former MC social chairman defeat’ the Indepen-
dents’ Danny O’Connell, Engr. ’58, by a narrow 13-11 margin.

After election results were announced by Election Chair-

man Jackllardman, assistant toe

the dean of men, Sobel immedi-
ately assured the Independents
thatthey will “beneﬁt from any
legislation passed” during his ad-
ministration.

What was originally the an-
nual Men’s Council banquet
turned into an election meeting.
Ex-president Dimitri ‘Petra in-
formed the new Council during
the banquet that the Student
Congress elections were schedul-
ed for this past Monday, and ad-
vised them to have their elec-

tions last Friday so they copld 

be represented in the SC elec- ‘
tions. The president of MC acts
as the oﬂicial “Council represen-
tati_ve in Congress. '
_ Only the president was elected
last week, but .'the other otﬁcers
' will be decided at 4:30 p.m. this
afternoon in the Panther Room.
All—Pitt Party Chairman Ted
Jamison said after the election

thought that Sobel was the “best

available man,” but also because
the All-Pitts were doing their best
to promote "harmony between the
two fraternity parties.”

One of the most trying ques-
tions to arise during the elec-
tions was how to handle the
votes of three absent representa-

Peake Directs Knox, Michigan Housing

New Dormt Plan Set

A former member of the

Federal Housing Administra-

tion, Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld knows his real estate.
Obviously he knows how to get it. But he hired Dr. Charles
Peake. because Peake knows how to use it.

The assistant chancellor was instrumental in establish-
ing at the University of Michigan the “Michigan House
Plan” widely known as a program for making college dor-

mitory life part of the total edu-6

cational program. ‘

He is also the creator of the
Knox ,College program. There,
eight students are assigned to four
rooms a ﬂoor with their own pri-
vate lounge. . '

Large View Needed

“Students who come to. a Uni-
versity must get a larger view” of
their education, Peake expressed
himself. They must learn to study
in areas conducive to contempla-
tion and concentration. They must
learn to live together and to adjust
to changes in living modes, he
said, in effect.

He was the ﬁrst faculty resi-
dent advisor in the new resident
halls which were in the process
of being built when he arrived
at Michigan where his position
as assistant dean of_the College
of Lierature, Science, and the
Arts, gave him sway over 6,700
students, the largest single group
in the University.

chancellor developed the famed
“West Quadrangle” which consist-
ed of eight separate “houses,” each
with 120 to 140 students, ,

To develop an intimate note in
the large halls, a resident faculty
member lived on each ﬂoor, setting
the academic tone and discipline.
A woman as social director of each
house established the so-called
‘-‘social"" attitude among the men.

Grad Students ,Used

On each ﬂoor, there was also a
graduate student who served as
assistant resident advisor-such
students ar'e chosen from varied
ﬁelds of interest to lend variety to
the dorm situation.

In the’ Knox College Plan, one

has a private lounge—-in the new-

enough to merit the cost expended.

Councils For Dorms

Dorm Councils only function-

within the dorms and only hous-
ing problems come within their
jurisdiction. But they often 'plan
parties in the dorms for social
life; instructors and advisors often
drop in for bull sessions.
According to an enthusiastic
freshman pre - medical student
whom this writer interviewed,
women are invited frequently to
the dorms. Paul Norris described
one party: “On the ﬁrst ﬂoor
people__sit around and play cards
or chat around; on the second
floor they can dance to a small
band in the lounge and get re-
freshments. Everyone seems to
havea good time.” '

The lounges are constantly open
for bull sessions: but rooms are for
the sole use of studying and sleep-
mg.

“Not enough students know how
to study,” Dr. Peake asserted.
“Few can concentrate on a sub-
ject for a solid hour.” Best possi-
ble conditions‘ are provided in the
dorms for relaxation and study. 3

Frosh Live in Dorms

All freshmen ‘are required to
live in the dormitories, because
“the ﬁrst-year is terribly import-
ant” to help the student ‘develop
his goals, Peakestated. The turn-
over among the men is usually
good; approximately ﬁfty per cent
of the student men join fraternities
in their advanced_years at Knox,
opening room for new freshmen
moving into the‘ dorms.

‘For the women, one large apart-
ment house is provided, although
another building will soon be built
for them Peake stated. A’, special
hotel has been purchased there for
married students and their wives.

These are the two popular pro-
grams with which Dean Peake has
experimented —- both based on

Tells About

Challenging
Philosphy

Among - Dr. Peake’s more
prominent qualities is mobili-
tY- .
After having combined with
an architect to design an ultra-
modern home in Ann Arbor,

‘ he was offered "the “challenge”

‘at Knox College. Despite that he
and his family had not livedtin
the home Chad a view on top of a
hill ﬁve miles around) even a
year, ,he accepted the Knox posi-
tion without any "qualms, saying,
in effect, he wouldn’t be a slave

. to 'fa_.building.

The Peakes have just recently
moved into a ranch-type bunga-
low which he designed. Yet, with
the Knox Renaissance well under
way, he accepted the position at
Pitt ,and must sell the second
moderne. He’l1 probably have
more difficulty ﬁnding a plot of
land in Pittsburgh than at any

V‘ other place. ,

. New Man Like Changes
But he likes changes for the
personal challenge that they-give

‘ him. Enthusiastic about anything

-' he takes up, the .appoin_tee ex-

-pressed surprise at being given

"  the Pitt job: “-1 never thought of

going out of the academic area.”

His whole educational philos-
ophy,' however, expresses the
same type of freedom and move-
mentthe expresses in his archi-—
,tecture. “The_ nice thing about
educational institutions is that
you can change them,” he em-
phasized while walking along

4’ the rKnox College viewing the

rapidly growing campus.

In, a small college, one must
.measu're objectives carefully and
constantly; the goals must bg de-
ﬁned, and administration and fa-
culty must know, exactly what
objectives are set up and what
must be deevloped within the stu-
dent. “The secret of intellect and
social growth is _motivation for

‘ purposeful learning,” he empha-

'It is the job of careful counsel-

 ing to gain insight into special
 aptitudes and interests of students

and to relate them to‘ speciﬁc
‘goals, he continued. ,
Far too often, Dr. Peake point-
' ed out, students‘ have entered

ﬁelds to which they are com-
pletely unsuited, because of
family pressures. He cautioned,
for example, that the student
A who finds himself inadequate in‘
an engineering course should be
guided into another field of the
University to which he is more
suited. ‘ _
Arrangements should be made
‘to guide students so that an ori-

- ginal_sense of failure born of too

high goals can be turned into .a
feeling “of success in other Uni-
versity areas. .

The problem oftenppresents it-
self of the student who‘ sets his
goals too low, and, thus, fails to
experience the full intellectual
growth of which he is capable,
Peake brought out during the
conversation. , .

Advising, Counseling Differ
vHe pointed out the vast diff-
erence between advising students
;in curriculum at the beginning of
semesters or occasionally through‘-
out- the year and. guiding them to
those values that providea__ most-
extensive intellectiial experience.

1 Students must be given a

“burning desire” for understand-

ing, Dr. Peake stated, enraptur-

ed with the prospect of ﬁnding .

students to so direct. Unfor-

tunately/the practical philos-
opher ‘stated, something too
often “doesn’t happen” to those

Versed in all aspects of student activities in the universi-

V “ties where he has held academic positions, Dr. Peake ran the

gamut in discussing general practices and attitudes of extra

1  "-and co-curricular programs. Here, abbreviated, are sofme of .
I . his comments concerning a variety of subjects:

Registration—“In order to buildup residential students
an— extensive scholarshipxprogram should be in effect.”

and Continuity‘ are signiﬁcant
problems.” A means must be de-
vised to train students in broad
aspects of government programs.
-Student government has as its
primary responsibility, “the devel-
in a community relationship.” It
.is a “kind of small microcosm,
» where they (students) learn to de-
velop programs for common good.”
“Student opinions and needs
should be voiced and given to ad-
without administra-
tion losing its responsibility.”
Young Democrats and Young Re-
publicans —e‘.‘They're conventional
‘ organizations.” . .
Religion—-“There is a legitimate
area for strong programs in the
’ general area of -religion.” Such
programs must be appropriate and
in character with institutions that
are not sectarian universities.”
‘Dr. Peake pointed out an exten-

sive program of ‘academic -courses

. offered ‘within the Humanities re-
quirements at Knox College "con-
cerning such topics ' as

- ¢¢G!.\ea.r
J; Ideals in, the Non‘-‘Christian. Re-
...,.7§.n.d~r’:f.‘Types of .Religious

‘One “can’t realistically separate
spiritual development of students
from the secular education they
receive.”

Honor System——Taking ﬁrm hold
at Knox College since its inception
ﬁve years ago: “requires a great
deal of energy and a certain de-
votion.”

Book Store—“A good book store
should provide an insight into the
intellectual life of the University.”
Dr. Peake remarked on the large
number of high quality books ap-
pearing in pocket—book editions
within the means of students.
Publications——“The big job of all
student editors is to learn princi-
ples of editorial responsibility.”
Although he does not believe in
censorship, Peake does stress the
need of editorial responsibility-
the obligation for disseminating
theitruth. .- ,

people with special competence.

Counseling must work on the
“referral principal”. Professors
who realize a problem must know
immediately towhom they can re-
fer a student for further. guidance,
and the student who leaves a

I University because of incompati-

bility of some sort leaves “always
with a sense of failure.” _
Problem Most Important
Peake considers this problem
one of great.impdi'tance in the
intellectual situation of the Uni-
versity. 1- . I
.At Knox college, there are
full-time counselors. In other
;school_ situations, admissions
departments even conduct pre-
admission counseling.’ Such‘- a.

program, however, can be far -
easier used in a small College -

than a large University.

Close contacts and intimate re-
lationships are important between
students ‘and faculty members in
order ‘to develop that-“burning
desire” which comes ‘of atmos-
phere conductive to study and to
assure “permanent goals” for in-
dividuals. A - i/

, This is Dr. Peake’s primary
educational philosophy. When he

speaks of it-, his square jaw sets-

ﬁrmer, the lines in his face grow
taut — it’s his life work and his
life philosophy. And it is always
challenging him. ,'

Nationality Rooms—Creates re-
spect and proper attitude toward
pationality groups. “A ﬁne way of
meeting the situation in a nice
manner.”

and Job
Placement-—“They should _be re-
lated with counseling.” A
Fraternities and Sororities-They
prove important on campuses.
Schools should attempt to assure
good facilities for these groups al-
though they should not necessarily
supply funds for houses.
Faculty-Student Relations-“Open
House Night” is a steady thing at
Knox. In the fall, each group of
students meets with their particu-
lar counselor in an initial get—to-
gether. The relations continue‘
throughout the ‘year.

 

RelaXedAt_I_nospheree

Important
When Dr. Peake arrives at

sponsibility will be to direct
converted from the Schenley

for Union

the University, his prime re-
the student union facilities,‘
Park Hotel. .

He has been carrying on consistent correspondence with
New York architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and will

be here to see renovations'being made over the summer.

\

According to Peake, it would be far better to have th
remodeling done before students move in than to- have
workmen hammering; away around them. But, if the time
lapse is too short for the renovation program, s_tudents may

either move into facilities at a

later date than in September

or suffer the workers developing‘
around them.

Three Stories Considered

From a general impression,
Peake feels conﬁdent that the ﬁrst
three stories will be ready for oc-
cupancy in September, .

Although ﬁnal plans for initial
changes will be laid with the
architects next week when Peake
arrives in town, dining facilities
and a few meeting rooms will
probably be the first facilities open
to students—-with proper atmos-
phere.

In discussionsheld Saturday
night'and through Sunday,
Peake continuously emphasized
the idea of “atmosphere.” He
pointed out to this reporter at
small dining hall in the Hotel
Custer‘ which had been decor-
ated in a colonial Dutch motif
with a large, gaily-decorated
kitchen cupboard and a stone
well from which waitresses drew
ice water. '

“Atmosphere is so very important.

Student Life Reviewed

He reviewed. facets —of student
union life both at Michigan and
at Knox, and, although he didn’t
attempt to relate them to the Pitt
situation because he doesn’t know
enough about .it, it did seem to
this writer that he would most
assuredly like to see them’ insti-
tuted at the Schenley Park Hotel
building.

In the “Gizmo” at Knox (sim-
ilar in purpose, but more ade-
quate than Tuck Shops) instruc-
tors will sit around to chat and ‘
play bridge with the students
in an_ informal, leisurely way".

Last of a Series

Salvaterra, Kaliden,

Lewis, Fight for QB

By DON KAISERMAN
The key to the “T” is the quarterback. Last season, Pete
Neft took over the signal—caller post in the Panther version
of the T-formation at mid-season and sparked the Blue and

Gold to the Sugar Bowl. ,

, This year, the all-important position is up for grabs.
Two veterans, Corny Salvaterra and Darrell Lewis, appear

to have an edge over their less-experienced rivals.

Salvaterra was being counted
upon to lead the team last year.
after being dubbed a “sophomore
sensation” in 1954. In fact, some
pre-season prognosticators went
so far as to rate him as one of the
East’s top offensive backs.

National Magazine Praises Corny

However, the 6-0, 195-pound
senior failed to live up to these

' rave notices, and apparently was

suffering from an overly-cautious
outlook. More aften than not, he
preferred to run with the ball, in-
stead of heaving it on intended
pass plays.

Salvaterra looked very im-
pressive at the start of spring
drills, but an ankle injury which
will keep him out of gridiron

~ togs until next fall, may handi-
cap himin his bid for the start-
ing post.

The potential, though, is deﬁn-
itely present in Salvaterra’s case.
“SPORTS ILLUSTRATED” said
of him—“When he’s hot, can be
a brilliant back, dangerous passer,
and very elusive runner.”

Passing Hampers Lewis
If he improves enough defen-
sively, the -Wilkes-Barre senior
may well prove to be more than an
adequate replacement for Neft.

, At the moment, though, due to
Salvaterra_’s injury, Lewis is
holding down the number one
spot. A left-handed ﬂinger from
Wilkinsburg, Lewis is also a
hard runner. But, as yet,.he has
failed to show that he can be a
competent passer.

- Lewis’ biggest asset is that he
provides great leadership and runs
the team well, as was demonstrat-

. ed in the closing seconds at New

Orleans last January. The 5-10,
190-pound senior is a two-time
letterman and can be counted on
as a steadying inﬂuence.

Fusia High on Kaliden
On the other side of the experi-
ence ledger is Bill Kaliden, a 6-0,
185-pound sophomore from Home-
stead. Without a single varsity
game under his belt, Kaliden is
already one of the squad’s most
publicized players.
He has evoked praise from
both the press and his coaches.
- Backﬁeld coach Vic Fusia, al-
though leery of making any pre-
dictions, stated that “Kaliden

The Homestead ﬂedgling already

Oxford Quartet Favored

Coach Carl Olson has a bad cold to take care of, but it’s

not his own. Jim Moore, a stalwart on the two mile relay '

him from running this coming weekend in the Penn Relays.

As a result, the Blue and Gold

may not even enter the relay, _

which should give the favored Oxford team a clear road

to Victory.

Troubles seem to come all at’

showing the ef-

this distance in
the Ohio Relays
last week-end.
Paul Thrash, another sophomore
who lacks- experience, will be run-
ning in the 400—meter hurdles and
is one of the locals’ big hopes to
register some points for the squad.
Thrash will also be running a lap

Late Friday afternoon, Arnie‘

upon the runners he will enter in

before the team departs for Phila-

 Lewismen to Initiate
Home Season Today

By AL ABRAMS
The Panther baseball team has been battling two factors
so far this season and have not done too well against either.
, The ﬁrst is that scheduled by the athletic department
and the second is the unscheduled weather which cancelled
most of the spring training and has continued to plague the

,9-. rtimeof the game will

' fact: that

squad into the season.

The home opener with Geneva was cancelled yesterday
due to snow, and the Panthers will open their season at

home today, weather

permitting at Mellon Field. Starting
be 3 p.m.

Since the ﬁrst two weeks of the 1956 campaign with the

Panthers losing ﬁve out of the" ﬁrst¢

six ball games, the question of
what is wrong with the Panther
baseball team has been asked by
a number of the sportsminded
student body.

Lewis Needs Combination

Coach Bobby Lewis, before the
1956 season got underway, was
.looking_ for a better season than
last year, but so far has been un-
able to come up with the right
combination of pitching and hit-
ting.

Every, time the batters are.
having a ﬁeld day, the pitching
seems to collapse and when the
pitchers have good stuff on the
ball, the batters seem to fall in-
to a lethargic mood. In order to

win ball games, the right com-

bination of both‘will have to _be I

found. . '

Another fault that has slowed -
t down the Pitt nine has been the

wildness of‘ their pitchers in the
opening stages of the games. The
squad has lost 'four out of ﬁve ball
games——due to this wildness.

Training Curtailed
This can partly be blamed, as
can the rest of their woes, on the
spring, training was
greatly curtailed because of the

" bad’ ',weather.

In. the past week’s games, the

- Pan’,-thers looked better than at any

other time during the,,season. After
a game was called off with St. Vin-
cent’s due to a snow storm, the

Pittites traveled to Bucknell. It

wasthere the team won their ﬁrst
game .of the season, thanks/to the
booming bat of Bill Schmitt and
the twirling of Ronnie Moog.
Schmitt came up in the third
inning with two on and smacked
a triple to drive in both runners:
Then in the sixth, he stepped to
the',p_late,~with the bases loaded
and slammed a grand slam home
run, to give him six i'uns-l)aa-

- ted-in of the ten that the Pan-

thers acquired.
Moog pitched a good ball game
and ‘only weakened in the ﬁfth in-
ning to give up ﬁve runs. Other

"  Panthers Meet ‘Reds’
Then the Panthers journeyed to
Cornell to meet the “Big Red” in

a Saturday encounter, and were
looking for revenge of a defeat
from last year. As it turned out the
Panthers will have to wait until
next year to get their revenge.
They dropped a 3-1 decision.

Honored at Athletic
Fete Monday Night

Arnie Sowell, Pitt’s world
renowned half-miler, was
given the highest athletic
award of the University Mon-
day night at a giant banquet
held at Webster Hall.

Sowell was awarded the
Charles C. Hartwig Award ”for
having done most to promote and
sponsor the best interests ‘of ath-
letics at the University of Pitts-
burgh.” , . ‘

Bill Schmitt, football guard and—

leading baseball hitter, was given
the Athletic Committee Award for
being the student “who has.main-
tained the best combination of
high scholarship, all—around ath-
letic ability, sportsmanship, and
aptitude.” '
Special Merit Awarded

Chester Zukowski, Col. ’56, who
has been head cheerleader for two
years was given a special merit
award. Zukowski served last year
as student representative to the
Athletic Committee.

Approximately 350 athletes were
in the banquet crowd -of 500 to
see the top Pitt athletes receive
special commendation and to cheer
the Sugar Bowl football team who
received a special tribute from
assistant band director Benny Be-
nack and his musicians. "They
played.“Hail to Pitt," dixie-land
style. «
Sowell, the Panthers’ big hope-'
ful in the 1956 Olympics in Mel-
bourne will have his name carved
onuthe Charles C. Hartwig walk
between Heinz Ohapel and the
Cathedral. The ‘track star is the
ﬁrst junior to be so honored.
