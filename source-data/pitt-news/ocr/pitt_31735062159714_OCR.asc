Last Hope Gone  

The strong doubts, long in our minds and in the minds, we’re
»,sure, of a largenumber of students, whether student government
as it exists here has any real value were justified last week, at
-‘least insofar as Student,Congress is concerned.

“In fact, the disgusting affairs involved in last Tuesday's reor-
Vganizational meeting of Congress weakened the lone reason on
ywhich we had been willing to tolerate the existence of student
g‘overn"ment. We are now inclined to believe that the University
would be better off without it.

,We doubt very much that there would be many complaints from
the students. Those who don’t either ignore it, tolerate it, or laugh
eat it are in a definite minority. ’
* * * *

=i=jl¢

‘ The News’ toleration of it has been based on a hope that Con:
gress and the other student government groups could at leastiserve
[as a training ground for future politicians. Long ago we saw that
these groups weren’tneither necessary or competant in representing
he students at Pitt. Other organizations do that and much better.
 If the "dirty politics” that took place at Congress’ session
last week is the t-hing our aspiring student politicians should be
P‘ trained in, we don’t want any part of it. ‘For some reason, the lid
came offthe dirty work involved inthe election of next year's Con-
rests president last T,uesday. Theiiicentral figures in the series of
, barges and counter-charges saw the bad light their stupid blun-
ders put them in the next day. They tried to whitewash the filth
with letters to the News.

>F=I<* **=l<

T This disgusting business points up that these so-called politi-
cians apparently were not particularly concerned with the abili-
ties of the presidential candidates when they crept below boards
and tried to "buy’.’ votes.
i— By no means do we intend to infer that either Howard Green-
tberger, the new Congress president, or Don Ewart, his defeated
rival, are not capable men. If anything can be done to raise Con-
gress from the depthsjintoi which it has plunged, they, probably
better than anyone else, can do it. But we see little hope for this;
hence to us the post of president carries with it only much more
prestige than the office is worth.

Cpnjgress has been the worst example of the several such or-
ganizations. Men’s Council has never dipped as low, although it
can hardly be given a clean bill of health and labeled a valuable

about student government, can’t be answered adequately. So why

One thing that was politics-free

Sound Criticism

. The Writer’s Conference was ap-
parently a successful venture, as

usual. Lawrence Lee, English de-
partment, coined a proverb when he

replied to the query “How do you
criticize your own work?”

Mr. Lee", revealed that the only
criticism he does is, when a poem

is finished,he gets up from the type-
writer and crys Hip, hip, hooray.
Pretty sound criticism, I’d say.

I see where Miss Ruth Cramblet
was tapped as an honorary member

of Cwens. Miss Cramblet probably
fills allthe requirements except one.
That one is "to show real purpose

'of leadership for the University
ideal.” The University ideal is cer-
tainly not exorbitant coffee and food
prices. A

The followingis a paragraph from
a story read by Dr. Denton Beal to
his English l8iclass:

It. was interesting to note the mad rush of the politicians to.
cry out that their hands were clean after the revelation of the
farce that took place before the Student Congress election.

I’m not making any accusations; all I can say is (to paraphrase

man desirable in medicine.”

About 2300 optimistic pre-meds
from colleges filed applications in
1949 for 86 openings in Pitt’s School
of Medicine. Increased facilities
will make it possible to enlarge the
the school’s freshman class to 100
students, but even allowing for dup-
licatevs filed with different schools,
the supply everywhere far outstrips
the demand.

Alternate Plans Needed

Med school is just one kind of
graduate school, Dr. Horn points out.
The only sensible pre-med in his
opinion is the one who has»-~at the
back of hismind an alternative plan
to take graduate work leadingﬁto a
Ph. D. in a field related to his un-
dergraduate major. The bacteriology
major who is turned down, for instance,
could go into teaching, public health,
virus research, etc.

Well qualified students have to
be turned away every year. Lack ‘of
facilities and the large number of
vets are small parts of the reason.
Mainly, though,the answer sefiéms to
be that too many people want to be
doctors! . _ '
The dental school here at Pitt
takes a different tack in selecting
its students. In 1949 some 4000
would-be dentists from district col-
leges asked admission, according
to W.F. Swanson,-associate dean of
the school. ,

Of these, .200 with the highest
quality point averages were allowed
to take a competitive exam. The
exam includes a physical test for
skill with the hands. Ninety-six suc-
cessful candidates were accepted.

Dentists In Demand

More dental school graduates are
badly needed. The increasing em-
phasis on dental health is making
the U.S. teeth-conscious.

Men who can afford the $4289 es-
timated’ as the average cost of edu-
cation(YourCareer-Simon and Schus-
ter, 1949) and the costly investment
in equipment will probably never
lack cavities to fill, since only an
estimated 22 per cent of the U.S.
population receives dental care in
any given year. "

_ V» By GEORGE BARBOUR
‘The green grass and the budding
trees on the Cathedral lawn provide
one of the most attractive nature
“plots in the Oakland district. 
‘»“This was the consensus of op-
,‘ ‘ expressed by some of the
high school students interviewed
during their visit to‘the University
last week. Six thousand of them
‘were guests of Pitt and participants
 the Pennsylvania Forensic and
Music League contests. ~«
/‘But one thing that shocked several
fgirls .Was the speed of the Uni-
v_?ersity’s, elevators. "It’s just like
rcidingi a jet,” one student saidas
sliej cruised to a 12th floor stop.
Itchy Blanketscause Gripes
‘Itchy. blankets were one of the
main gripes about the housing facil-
ities at Ellsworth Center. “And the
'.p‘l'_ace is dirty too,” they said. "We
~wash=‘ practically every time we get
~a“ chance,” one girl said.

‘Smoke- control in Pittsburgh is
W nei thing that has not been effec-

[When asked -who Len Casanova
s, the _answers ranged from a
»las_sic lover to a contest judge in
~the high school finals. Only several
‘ofthe male students knew Casanova
as head football coach at Pitt.
»«The first night of staying on the
lac-akmpus the girls at Ellsworth Center
were awakened in the middle of the
tnightby the terrific thunder storm.

 A Cafeteria Food Enjoyed
,;.;T~he food at the cafeterias was
«]ud‘ge'd “excellent” in most cases.
This held true at Ellsworth Center
,also. ,However, several students
stated that by the time they had
climbed to their third floor Ells-
lworth rooms, they were ready to
‘eat’; again.
~ S The Nationality Rooms were
‘the ‘attractions which most students
P _wan*ted“to see. Their close sched-
‘u_lesijjin participating in events kept
hem from doing so, however.
5On the whole, the students stated

Speaking of the students and their

Physician Dr. George Spencer had
some interesting things to say.
A surgical program that is expec-
ted to begin next fall will give stu-

will be an important addition to their
regular course of study.

Freshmen as well as seniors,-g

estimated that between 15,000 and
20,000 patients are treated at the
hospital each year. This affords
freshmen excellent opportunity to
study many types of disease proces-

Walter I. Bradbury, managing edi-

that the service of a writers,’ con-

cited the judgment of Mrs. Amy Fox,
another conference speaker, that
writing is a lonely profession. '

Since that is, so, it does an as-

Mrs. Amy Fox, author of “Kim

In a battle for second place in
the Professional Softball League,
the Dental Sophomores defeated
the Delta Sigma Deltas by the foot-
ball score of 18-13 at Ellsworth

The Dents wasted very little
time in scoring as they took ad-
vantage of three singles, six bases

eight runs in the first. inning

who had two singles and a double,
paced the Dents’ 15-hit onslaught.

Leaders of the Delta Sigs‘ attack
were George Barankovich and Dale
Hamilton. Barankovich, an acro-'
batic left fielder who likes to stand
"on his head, may become the lea-
gue’s Ralph Kiner. His home run
in the first inning with two mates
aboard was his fourth .in as many

"I grew up with Ralph Kiner,

and today, Kiner is making $65,000
a year and I’m getting $75‘ a month
and an education.” '

Jim Rowden speaking, 28-year-old
senior'in Bus Ad at Pitt and the
lifelong friend of the Pittsburgh
Pirates’ slugging outfielder.

Rowden and Kiner were raised to-

it was through Kiner that his buddy

Get Together Often

Every chance that his class sched-
ule permits, Rowden takes in the
ball game at Forbes Field to watch
"our local boy that made good.”
Kiner and Rowden get together about
four or five times a week when the
club is in Pittsburgh. .

When they were kids back in Al
hambra‘, they always played for the
same team. They played American
Legion, high school, and semi-pro
ball—-Kiner as an outfielder and
Rowden as a catcher.

Rowden was the first to attract
the attention ofthebig league scout s,
and he was signed to a contract with
Hollywood of the Pacific Coast
League in 1940. Kiner was signed
by the Pirates soon afterwards and
assigned to Albany of the Eastern
League.

‘Just a Boy’

"They separate‘ the men from the
boys in pro ball, and it turned out I
was one of the boys,” reflects Row-
den. “Kiner had it though.”

The 6-0, 190-pound_receiver fin-
ished out 1940 with El Paso, and
played with Boise, Idaho in 1941.
His baseball career was cut short
by the war, and when he finishe,

« his three and a half year stint in

the Air Force, he gave up the thought
of continuing the sport.

."I decided to get‘ an education
then, and entered Southern Califor-
nia in'1946. Since then, I've attended
Colorado, Tulane, and now Pitt. I
hope to graduate this summer.

Casanova to Pick Lineups

For Grid “Intra-Squad Game

By STAN sKmBoLL
Football Coach Len Casanova Will probably pick his starting teams
today for the intra-squad game this Saturday at the Stadium.

The contest, which is scheduled
to begin at 2 p.m., following the
Pitt-Ohio track meet, will wind up
spring drills for the grid Panthers.

Casanova, in all probability, will
base his final Choices on showings
of last week’s scrimmages and an
intra-school tilt with Carnegie Tech
held last Saturday.

Casanova Undecided
Although Casanova hasn't deter-
mined which teams will battle against
each other, it seems as if the first

‘ and‘ third teams will run against the

second and fourth squads.

At the present time it appears
that the first string will have Ted
Geremsky and Nick DeRosa_ at the
ends, Nick Bolkavac and Bill Gas-
paravic at the tackles, Mike Boldin
and Rudy Andabaker at the guards,
with George Radosevich at center.‘

The backfield will probably show
Bob Bestwick at quarterback, Jim
Campbell and Bill Sichko at the

halfbacks,with Fullback PaulChess
rounding out the backs.

Second String Unsettled

The second-string team is more
unsettled, but from present indica-
tions the starting team could have
Chris Warriner and John Masarik at
the ends, BillMihm and Flint Greene
at tackle, Merle DeLuca and Don
Karanovich at the guards, and John
Dazio at center.

Bob Osterhout willpilotthe second
stringers unless the injured Bill
Doziski is able to participate. Bill
Reynolds and Armand DiFonso will
be atthe halfbacks, and John Huzvar
will be at fullback.

By DON MURDOCK ,

Pitt track Coach Carl Olson can
call his track season a success.
Last year’s lone defeat at the hands
of Notre Dame was avenged Satur-
day by a narrow margin, 65 2/3 --
65 1/3, at the Stadium. This Satur-
day the Stadium will be the scene
of another track meet when the
Panthers entertain Ohio U.

It took Pitt 13 long years to defeat
the Irish in a collegiate sport and
oddly enough it was the track team
of 1937 that last pulled the trick.

Johnny Wilson, long-striding anch-

or man on the Pitt mile relay team, .

brought back memories of the great
Pitt anchor man of 1937, Johnny
Woodruff. His brilliant overtaking
of Jerry Johnson and then holding
on to a slim lead to win at the tape
by a whisker enabled the Panthers
to win the_mile relay and the meet.
The winning time was 3:2l.3.

Other Important Wins

Wilson’s spectacular run was the
leading factor in the Panther vic-
tory, but there were other victories
which played top roles in the win.

Dick Firsching took first place
in the 440-yard dash, Norman Proc-
tor did the best inithe high Eump,
Al Yedlicka scored five points in
pole vault, and Wilson came in first
in the 880—yard dash. ~

Fleming Stand Out
Only one of the Notre Dame re,-
cord-breakers bore out his news-
paper clippings. That was Bill
Fleming, who won the low and

high hurdles with plenty to spare.

But all thoughts‘*that the Panther A

thinclads may have of resting on
their laurels will have to be for-
gotten if they plan on getting past
Ohio this Saturday. Ohio has held
the Mid-American Conference track
title the last two years. Last year
the Panthers whipped Ohio at
Athens 71% -- 50%.
