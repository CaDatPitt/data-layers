Marthajane Poe, the ghost of the Early

Allan Poe.

Maxine Brulms, director of ‘the

Nationality Rooms and Martha]ane’s _

granddaughter, likes to tell the tale.

She says the spirit lives in the Early
American Room, located at room 327
ofthe Cathedral ofLea1-ning. It’saspace
with 16th century décor, including a
table with chairs and a large ﬁreplace.
Atﬁrst glance, it appears to be the only
room. But on the right side ofthe room,

When climbingto the bedroom, the
stone steps exhale with force, sighing
inrelief as the visitor reaches the door-
way. This bedroom is decorated with
19th-century-style furniture, much of
which was donated by the Poe family.
Grandma Poe’s wedding quiltis draped
over the bed, with her framed picture
next to it. There is also a cradle with
bedding that Bruhns used when she
was ababy.

But how did this room become
haunted? Brulms said the ghost stories

Miguel said they chose to throw a

Edgar Allan Poe relative might haunt Cathedral room

Bmhns said she curled up in her sleeping bag
at the foot of the bed and placed her purse on a
chair beside her. As she lay there, she listened to
the Cathedral breathe around her, moaning with
crea1<s and groans.

Bruhns was just about to fall asleep when she
suddenly awoke to a “swishing” sound above
her head, similar to that of moving material, she
said.

Seconds later, she heard a loud crash.

As [Bruhns] lay there,
she listened to the

“'I‘hat’s when I picked up my belongings and
said, ‘Grandma, you can have this damn room!”’
Bruhns said. ’

There are more eerie stories. When the Uni-
vetsitywas renovaﬁngthe EarlyAmerican Room

a few years ago, someone carefully wrapped the
picture of Grandma Poe and placed itinadrawer.
After the room repairs were complete, Bruhns
tookthe picture outto ﬁnd two large cracks inthe
middle of the ﬂame. The contractors insisted they
were careﬁilwith the picture and didn’t break it.

So who was responsible? The room can only
be opened with a key for guided tours. Bruhns
blames it on her phantom ancestor.

_ well. Though these reports cannotbe conﬁrmed,
it is interesting to note that the buildings entire
staircase is now caged in, indicatingthatperhaps
something dangerous did happen.

Whatever the reasonforthe protection, many
believe that a woman’s spirit, often referred to as
“Harriet,” haunts the 12th ﬂoor of the building.

The ﬂoor is now used as a rentable catering
facility for special events. However; on some late
nights, employees served more than just party
guests.

Accordingto “Ghost Stories ofPit1sburgh and
Allegheny County,” many ofthe roomswaitresses
complained aboutstrangeand unexplainable inci-
dents, like hearing footsteps and voices.

On one occasion, a waitress was in the room

it started again every time she walked out of the

like “they are being watched,“ according to the
book. In fact, night waitress Pat Castelli believed
that the spirit Harriet hadifollowed her home.
The incident started when she was cleaning up
by herselfbut got the feeling that someone was
watching her. When shecame home, she walked
into the house with alingering eerie feeling. .

Like most nights, she turned out the kitchen
light and begantowalkdown herdarkhallway
until she bumped into someone’s chest. Castelli '
thought shehadcollidedwith her husband, so she
said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t even see you there.” She
continued down the hall only to ﬁnd her spouse

Bleaus said it canbe important for identity, as
well, as just part of a culture.

“For some, drag is a stepping stone to transi-

is just a unique cultural phenomenon in the gay
community,” she said.

In a long blonde wig, Bleaus began the show
with pom-poms, high kicks and splits —— all on

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I cannot help but express dis-
agreement with the recent dis-
missal of concealed carry as an
appropriate deterrent to crime in
Thursday’s editorial, “Students
need neighborhood watch pro-
gram.”

While there is a plethora of
good ideas in the article, it is tak-
en too far. Describing handgun-
carrying student “vigilantes” is a
gross misrepresentation. A stu-
dent with a gun who uses it to de-
fend himself against a potential

robber will send a stronger mes-
sage than any number of patrol-
man or police officers in Oakland
ever could. When the assaulter,
rather than the assaulted, ends
up in the hospital, criminals will
begin to think twice about rob-
bery in Oakland. It’s only when
criminals don’t see students as
easy targets that our neighbor-
hood will become a safer place.

Bernie Madoff just couldn’t settle fora

alleged that his New York oﬂice was
a frequent venue for cocaine and sex
parties. Of the numerous sources that
reported the story, one tidbit of infor-
mation was faithfully included across
most reports: His oﬁice was so satu-

unique — all Madoff coverage is ripe
with absurdity. From late night talk
shows to straight news, Madoff and
jokes go together like  well, sex and
cocaine, apparently.

Madoff jokes bring out our sadistic side, but in a very good way

correspond with that 0 “made 0 .”

Another reason why this Madoff joke was
funny was because Jay said it in this funny voice
that was really, really funny.

“This Madoff, what a number he must’ve
done on his mother. I mean, there’s obviously
somethingwrongwithhim, psychologically. The
woman probably had to see a shrink ‘til the day
she died, with this son of hers.” my mom said
while watching a “Dateline” special on" Madoff’s
Ponzi scheme. V

This technically isn’t a j oke, but] am including
it in this discussion because it is awesome.

“[Madoff] launched apiison fund that yielded two
handjobs per every pack of cigarettes invested,”

This Madoff quip prompts guffaws primarily
because it implies that Madoff is so devoid of mor-
als that he’d fail to learn from his mistakes, even
after being sentenced to 150 years in prison.

The joke also takes ashot athis  While
his Ponzi scheme had netted himbillions inprof—
its, thebesthe canhope fornowis ahandjob from
Bubba. Indeed, society loves tearing down its
fraudulent heroes. What we’ve done as a culture to
Barry Bonds and Millivanilli is pretty consistent
with what we’re doing to Madoffrlght now.

Of course, the Madoff debacle isn’t all jokes.

It exposed a major hole in the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s regulatory practices to
the public. Former SEC chairman Christopher
Cox acknowledged that “credible and speciﬁc
allegations” pertaining to Madoff’s ﬁrm were
never pursued.

The ubiquity of the story has prompted wide-
spread demand for change, and on Tuesday,
treasury officials and House Financial Services
Committee head Barney Frank, D—Mass., draft-
ed legslation which would give the government
broader oversight and require investors with
offshore ﬁinds to inform the SEC. Madoﬁ‘ had

Though Madolfdoesn’t nearly represent every
cause of the economic crisis, his downfall has
been cathartic. It’s like when you’re having a bad
day, you might chuckle a little harder when you
see somebody trip on the sidewalk.

Is it sadistic? I say it’s therapeutic. If we can
laugh about being broke, we might be less likely
to cry about it. Sure, we might be in ﬁnancial niin,
butwe can at least take solace in the fact that Ma-
doff now does business not in the North Pole of
cocaine, but in the Sahara desert of dignity.

Nothing ‘Paranormal’ about ﬂick ’s success

Kieran Layton
Aé'rE Editor

“Paranormal Activity”

Starring: Micah Sloat, Katie Feath-
erston

Director: Oren Peli

Studio: Paramount Pictures

Grade: B

Ten years ago, a little ﬁlm that you
mighthaveheard of——“The Blairwitch
Project’ ’——singlehandedly provedthat
ascaiy moviewithabare bones budget
and no  studio backingcan make
alot of money. I’m talkinga morethan
3,000 percent proﬁt above its produc-
tion cost

But now, witches are out, and de-
mons are in. Enter “Paranormal Ac-
tivity.”

By now, I imagine you’ve heard of
the ﬂick. The relentlessviral marketing
campaign has ensured that the public
should be very aware of “one of the

scariest movies of all time,” according
to www.B1oody-Disgustingcom.

While the ﬁlm might not deserve
such superlative categorization, I am
pleased to say that it is actually scary.
Not “Saw” scary, where you imagine
how twisted the writers minds that
think of that many creative ways to
kill people. Not “Couples Retreat”
scary, where you fear for the ﬁ1t1Jre of
Vince Vaughn’s career. It is a genuine
fright fest.

Borrowing liberally from “Blair
Witch’s” faux—documentary style of
ﬁlmmaking, the ﬁlm jumps right into
the lives of a young San Diego couple
who believe girlfriend Katie (Katie
Featherston) is being haunted by
a demon. Boyfriend Micah (Micah
Sloat) buys a hulking, expensive cam-
era —— he’s a daytrader — and wants
to document everything. Katie thinks
it’s a stupid idea.

The ﬁlm alternates between day-
time shots of the couple taking turns
carrying the camera around as they

Layton: A trick—or—treat bag of pop culture goodies, costume ideas

Kieran Layton
A65-E Editor

  
 

“Trick—or-treat, smell my feet, give me
something good to eat. If you don’t, I
don’t care, I’ll pull down your under-
wear.”

This classic Halloween rhyme likely
uttered at onepointoranotherby most
children doesn’t reallymakeany sense,
but it’s festive and offers a nice setup for
my end—of-October breakdown of the
most current pop culture goings-on.

As college students, we are too old
to trick-or-treat in a socially accept-
able manner, I am here to give you the
treats of the week (think Hershey bars
and cans of soda), the tricks (apples
and dental ﬂoss) and what I like to call
the Whoppers. Malted milk balls have
chocolate, so they aren’t completely a
trick, but still — yuck.

Treat: “Paranormal Activity” lives
up to the hype
The horror movie sensation is mak-

ing a frightening amount of money,
especially compared to its $11,000

budget. In the equivalent to getting a
$20 bill inyour bag on Halloween, the
ﬁlm is genuinely scary. Score one for
horror buﬁs everywhere.

Trick: “Saw VI” severs the series’
success

So guess what? It’s Halloween, and a
new“Saw‘ ’ movie came out. Surprised?
Probably not, but this one has done
very poorly compaied to the previous
entries.

’ Let me getthis straight: Thewriters
can continue thinking ofhorribly gro-
tesque and creative ways to kill people
usingbooby traps, butthey can’tcome
upwithawaytorevivethisdyinghorror
franchise? Where’s jigsaw when you
need him?

Whopper: “Antichrist” is released,
but not in Pittsburgh

The infamousLarsvonTriershocker
that manyviewersatsundance deemed
one of the most disturbing ﬁlms they
have ever seen is ﬁnally getiing atten-
tion stateside, but of course, it hasn’t
come out in Pittsburgh -— yet. What
good is hearing about how insane this

movieiswithouthavingthe opportunity
toseeit?IFCﬁlmswouldbesurprised
to see how much genital mutilation
and unsimulated sex Pittsburgh can
handle.

Treat: Alison Iraheta’s ﬁrst single
comes out

Iraheta, who came in fourth place
in this past season of American Idol,»
has released the ﬁrst single off her de-
but album, due in December. “Friday
I’ll Be Over U” instantly paints Iraheta
as a standout rock chick who comes
across as the love child of Pink, Kelly
Clarkson and Courtney Love circa her
Hole days.

Idon’t plan on being overthis song
anytime soon.

Trick: Kris Allens practical disap-
pearance from the scene

Who won American Idol last sea-
son? Itwasn’tAdam Lambert, t:hat’s for
sure. Idon’tthinkitwasAlisonIraheta,
orthatguythatthrewupthe heartsigns

everytwo second. Oh yeah, itwas Kris ‘

Allen. His debut single sounds like a
Barenaked Ladies B-side and is barely

makingaripple onanyofthe charts. Oh
well, Kris, there’s always Broadway.

Whopper: Adam Lambert releases
an outer space album cover

Glambert unveiled the cover for
his debut album, “For Your Entertain-
ment,” this week. Decked out in heavy
eye makeup and radiant blue hair, the
Glambertposes likeaBowie-esque an-
gel behind an outer space background
I understand his far—out style, and I’m
certainly looking forward to what will
hopefully be one of me great fall re-
cords, but really Adam — channeling

‘“Xanadu” has never done anyone any
favors. Not even Olivia Newton-John.

Treat: “Nip/Tuck” is back, and-it’s

    

better than ever

It turns out that “Glee” hasn’t kept

creator Ryan Murphy from churning if

out a quality product for those who
remain faithﬁil to the plastic surgery
drama. 1

Props on bringing Rose McGowan
andMarioLopezinasgueststars.While
one brings some surprisinglylegitimate
acting chops, the other offers the eye
candy that the series is so notorious
for.

Trick: The proposedOctomomand
Jon Gosselindating show

AHH! Calm down, everyone. They
shot down the rumors. Still, though, the
thought of Octomom, or Nadya Sule-
man, and the divorced Gosselin on a
single reality show—- dating! —is more
terrifying than the idea of a Michael

Jackson “Thriller” costume. Oh wait,
too soon?

Whopper: “The Hills” and “The
City’ are still boring

Yes,  Cavallari adds a much-
needed b*tch factor to “The Hills,”

Pumpkin flavor spices up local coffee drinks

Estelle tries a variety of pumpkin coffee drinks from popular local cafes and rates her favorites

Estelle Tran
Contributing Editor

As the days grow shorter, sleep—deprived college
students seek solace from long nights of paper
writing and exam studyingin a steaming cup of
rich, pumpkin spice coffee. ‘

The corporate coffee concocters ﬁght forfall
drink supremacy. Most offer lattes and coffee _
brews, some sell coolers and others have cap-
puccinos, butallthings considered, it’s not hard
to rank local pumpkin coffee drinks.

1. Starbucks — Pumpkin Spice Latte

This beveragehas been a favorite of mine
since intermediate school, whenmy mom for-
bade me to  coffee. Though it came with’
less whipped crean_1thanI’d prefer, atleastthere

was more smooth, pumpkin latte to drink. This "A

latte offers a hint of pumpkin, and it’s not too
sweet. This was the only drink that motivated
me to gulp it down and consider ordering an-
other. I ’

2. Panera Bread - Pumpkin Spice Latte
This pumpkin spice latte greeted’ my lips
with a thick, ﬁ'othy layer of whipped cream

,...

and a caramel drizzle. The hearty pumps of
pumpkin syrup at the bottom of the cup gave
this drink the most potent pumpkin ﬂavor. At
ﬁrst I thought this was my favorite, but as I kept
drinking, the latte tasted sweeter and sweeter.

Itwas almost a struggle to ﬁnish, and unfortu-

nately, it only comes in one 16—ounce size.

3. Caribou Coffee - Wild Pumpkin

I have a sweet tooth, but neither my tooth
nor my tummy enjoyed Caribou’s Wild Pumpkin
drinkfor long. This isthe most expensive drink
per ounce on this list, and with the S010 cap off,
it looks like the most decadent pumpkin drink.
With whipped cream andchocolate shavings
piled high, it looks likeacreamy dream dessert.
The mix of strong espresso, pumpkin spice,
white chocolate and aphantom mint taste —-

' that’s notin the drink description, by the way

—-— made the drink too sweet, even for me.
4. 7-11- Pumpkin Spice Cappuccino

To be fair, 7-11 doesn’t push pumpkin coffee
drinks like the other contenders in this compe-
tition. It also sells pumpkin spice cappuccinos
that don’t really seemlike cappuccinos at all. It’s
more like a super-sweet, thick pumpkin spice
hot chocolate. The machine doesn’t hide the

. mixing powder and hot water. But the beauty

of 7-11 is that you can prepare your own drink.
Considering7—11 coffees are less thanhalf of the
price of the competition’s drinks, Ihave no prob-

Add some dehydrated marshmallows and this
drink shoots up to number two.

of these ideas:

The Real Housewives of [Insert City Here]:
This costume only requires skanky dresses and
tacky jewelry. Extra points for Kim from the At-

lanta series, especiallywhen accompanied byher
groundbreaking single, “'I‘ardy for the Party.”

Bruno: Guys, here is your chance to dress as
revealingly as the girls. Have a female friend —
or even better, a gay ﬁiend — raid your closet,
and talk in the instantly noticeable accent for the
entire evening.

G—20 Protester: Wearyour normal clothes, but

Hyped-up fright film delivers intense scares

Paranormal 4 8

meander through sometimes tiresome dialogue
and the infamous “surveillance” shots of the cou-
ple’s bedroom during the night. The ﬁlm forces
a sense of intimacy on the audience unlike any
other recentﬁlm. ‘

Of course, if you’ve seen the previews, you
know that something spooky is indeed going
on the house. And taking yet another tip from
“Blair Witch,” “Paranormal Activity” brings the
tension to a very slow boil. It gives the audience

small tastes of terror for the ﬁrst hour with loud A

noises and blink—and-you’ll-rr1iss—itvisual effects.
Ican promise thatthereisapayoff, thoughmany
will argue whether it’s worth sitting through the

previous 85 minutes to get there.

One of the biggest drawbacks to “Paranor- A

trial Activity” is also its greatest strength —— the
fact that it is a virtual carbon copy of the “Blair
Witch”formula, done to an even lower-budgeted
extreme. Ifyou liked the latter, chances are that
youwilllikethe former, but“ParanorrnalActivity”
_ never really rises above the been-there—done—that
ambience that seeps into every celluloid nook
and cranny. ' ,
For me, it didn’t really matter. I love being
scared, and there are scenes inthe ﬁlmthat genu-
inely ﬁightened me more than any ﬁlm since,

Sloat and Featherston never give the impres-
sionthattheyare puuingon aperformance, which
I suppose is a good thing.’ But as the characters,
especially Katie, grow increasingly irritating as
the ﬁlm nears the 60 minute mark (take note
Hollywood: bickering couples are NEVER en-
tertaining), you’1lwonderwhythe demonwould
want to haunt such a grating person.

Forpracticallythe entireﬁlm, the story— and

— in many ways, the plot itself—- take a backseat
to the true money maker: those surveillance -

shots.

It’s crazy to think that a few minutes of what
amounts to security footage could frighten so
easily, but the  subtlety ofthese scenes, and
heightened terror later on, constitute whatwould
be the scariest YouTube video ever. But is that
really a good thing?

I have wanted to like “Paranormal Activity”
since I heard about it more than ayear ago from
some ﬁlm festival because I love an underdog
— especiallyascary one. But now, theﬁlmisthe
anti—underdog: It has already cleared $65 million,

and withthatin mind, it’s hard notto thinkofthe‘

ﬁlm as a smug work of manipulation.

Sure it’s scary, but one of the scariest movies
ever‘? Deﬁnitely not. The “BlairWitch” did itﬁrst
—— and to a much greater degree.

The ﬁnal scene in “Blair Witch” still haunts
me to this day. The ﬁnal scene in “Paranormal
Activity” — which is suspiciously similar —— is
ultimately forgettable, like the  itself

In March, the Pittbasketballtearn stood
on the court, shocked thatthey had just
fallen to the Villanova Wildcats in the
Elite Eight. With a halfof a second left
in the game,1W1ldcats’ guard Scottie
Reynolds hitatwo-pointjurnperto give
histeama76—74 lead and sendthe then-
No. 1 Panthers home from the NCAA
Tournament.

It was the end of the season for a
team that had national championship
dreams. »

With the defeat, there was no more
Levance Fields. Therewasno more Sam
Young. And, as fans found out follow-
ing the NBA Drait, there was no more
Dejuan Blair.

Heading into the 2009-10 carn-
paign, there was only one returning
starter, as 'I‘yrell Biggs also graduated.
Pitt guard Jermaine Dixon, a junior
college transfer last year, is also one
of two seniors on the team. The other,
Chase Adams, transferred from Cen-
tenary College in Louisiana over the
summer.

That’s two seniors and only one
year of combined playing experience

with Pitt’s basketball system. But that
doesn’tbother Dixon, who has quickly
earned respect from his coaches and
teammates.

“I deﬁnitely feel comfortable [witl1
a leadership role] ,” Dixon said. “The
players that left last year — even De-

Juan as a sophomore -— I learned a lot
from them.”

Last year, Dixon and the Panthers
ﬁnished with 28-3 regular season re-
cord and entered the NCAA Tourna-
mentasaNo. 1seed. Thatwas supposed
tobetheyearPittmadeitpastthe Sweet
16 and into the national title game.

So Dixon, who ﬁnished second in
steals for the Panthers last season, has
leitthe pastbehindhimandisfocusing
on what the team can accomplish in
the future.

“Same expectations,” he said sirn—
ply. “Wewantt0winaBig East champi-

onship, and we want to win a national

championship. It’s all possible  and
I thinkwe can do it with the talent we
have.”

But Dixon might have to wait afew
more weeks before he can get back on
the court. During the summer, he suf-

efered two different — but related —
injuries to his right foot. Playing in a
Pittsburgh summer league with other

Pitt, Duquesne and RobertMorris play-
ers, Dixon suﬁ'eredahairlineﬁ‘acturein
his right foot sometime in mid-July.

Lessthanthreemonths later, he had
surgery again. Both injuries sidelined
him for eight weeks, but his return
to the court is expected sometime in
December — just in time for Big East
play.

With the injury preventing Dixon
from practicing, he’s working hard to
retiimassoonaspossible, and itis slow-
inghim down from becomingaleader
on ayoungteam.

He said he spokewith Fields, who
was inasiurationlike Dixon’s atthe be-
ginning of last year, on Facebook and
Skype. Fields told him to stay involved
with the team and keep the players
focused. ' .

“[Levance] basicallytold meto keep
working hard and to push the other
guys to do the same,” Dixon said. “He
told me to beasideline coach and cheer-
leader for the team.”

The advice Fields gave Dixon stems

from a relationship that the two built .

lastseason. And eventhough one grad-
uated and is now playing profession-
ally in Russia, the coaching staff isn’t

surprised by the connection between ‘

the two players as Dixon becomes the

While the football team has a bye,
the weekend is still packed with
Pitt athletic competition.

Volleyball

Pitt’s volleyball team travels
east this weekend to face St.
John’s (8-16, 1-7 Big East) Friday
night and Connecticut (12-12, 5-3)
Sunday afternoon.

The Panthers (15-8, 7-2) re-
main on the hunt for the Big East
title. Undefeated Notre Dame
rests atop the conference at 8-0.
Cincinnati is in second at 7-1, and
the Panthers have the same con-
ference record as Syracuse.

St. John’s, meanwhile, sits
mired in a seven-match losing
streak. The Red Storm hasn’t won
in more than a month; their last

Sept. 25.

On Sunday, Pitt looks to
avenge last season’s 3-1 loss to
Connecticut. The Huskies de-
feated St. John’s last Saturday.
Before squaring up against the
Panthers, they play West Virginia
(13-11, 3-6) Friday night.

Cross Country

The Panthers’ cross country
team runs this Saturday in the
Big East championships in Mil-
waukee, Wis.

Pitt is well-rested, last racing
two weeks ago in the Princeton
Invitational. Junior Teddy Miller
paced all Panthers, ﬁnishing 29th
in the competition. Miyajohnson
led all Pitt women with a time of
24:39.40.

The championships consist
of an eight-kilometer run for the

men and a six—kilometer run for
the women.

Men’s Soccer

Another Panthers squad trav-
els to Wisconsin this weekend, as
the Pitt men’s soccer team closes
out a disappointing season Sat-
urday night at Marquette.

“[The Golden Eagles] are a
very good defensive team,” Pitt

coachjoe Luxbacher said. “We’ve

always had a good game with
them  we expect a very tight
defensive battle.”

The Golden Eagles (3-9-3,
2-4-3) have hit a patch of bad
luck over the past week. They
have been shut out of their last
two matches, and they also had
their Wednesday match against
Connecticut postponed due to
heavy rain.

Despite a poor record this sea-
son, Pitt (2-12-2, 1-8-1) has played

From Paternoville to “Turn It Blue,” what do Pitt
and Penn State have to lose? '

A possible meetingbetween the two classic gi-

ants ofPennsylvania college football would surely
create abuzz throughoutthis great state. There are
even some brainiacs outthere predictingPittis go-

ing to meet Penn State in this yea1’s Fiesta Bowl. —

Not so fast, my friend.

While I am a college football purist, one up for
the renewal of a great rivalry, there are about 99
percent ofBCS officials and athletic directors who
are not purists, nor optimists, nor Pennsylvania-
football enthusiasts.

Thereare manythings thatwould have to hap-
pen perfectly to allow for this matchup. Let’s look
at exactly what this grand scheme entails.

Pitt and Penn State, alongwith Iowa, mustwin
out, putting Iowa in the Rose Bowl ahead of Penn
State, which lost to Iowa. Texas mustwin out, slid-
ingfrom the Big12’s slotinthe Fiesta Bowl into the
national championship game. Florida orAlabama
hastowin outto remove one fmmthe SEC’s slotin
the Sugar Bowl and put it into the national cham-
pionship game againstTexas.

IfFlorida and Texas (Big12 champions in this
example) are ranked No. 1 and 2, then the Sugar

/

nn State are to play

Bowl picks ﬁistbecause itlostahigher—ratedteam
in Florida, followed by the Fiesta and then the Or-
ange Bowl. IfI‘exas is N 0. 1 and Florida No. 2, then

 the Fiestahas ﬁrst pick followed by the Sugar. The

Orange, which has a tie—in to take the ACC cham-
pion, isthirdbecause ofthe unlikelihood ofthe ACC
champion playing for the national title.

Keep in mind the amount of variables and
teams involved here. All in all, there are still more
than four weeks of football to be played to decide
all of this.

Here’s where it becomes delicate.

The Sugar Bowl will likely take Alabama, as-
suming it picks ﬁrst and the Crimson Tide loses
the SEC title game to Florida. The Fiestawould be
next, and itwould not be mandated, but would be
highly encouraged. to take another BCS—eligible
Big12 team to replace Texas.

But Oklahoma State, the onlyBig12 teamwithin
BCS eligibility at No. 14, plays Texas this weekend
and would surely drop after a loss.

That leaves Penn State, who is virtually free
to roam because of no commitment to the Rose
Bowl, and who has a favorable relationship with
the Fiesta committee.

The Orange would have the next pick, and it
could pick Pittto play its ACC Championin Miami
to end the Pitt—Penn State matchup dreams.

But the Fiesta could be left to choose between

non—BCS teams such as ICU and Boise State, or _

Piti; -

You see my point here? It could happen, in a
perfect world, in a Pennsylvania-football aﬁcio-
nado’s world. Butwith so manyvariables viable to
throwthis system into complete disarray, it looks
like Pittlans are goingto have to wait untiljoe Pa-
temo retires to get a crack at the Nittany Lions.

Oh wait, that’s never goingto happen.

Pitt Football Question of the Week:

In honor of Pitt’s blowout win over South
Florida last weekend, tell me, what was the larg-
est margin of victory Pitt has ever had over an
opponent?

Taylor, who correctly answeredthat redshirt junior
defensive back Ricky Gary is a cousin of Arizona
Cardinals receiver Anquan Boldin.

BigEast player ofthe week (0ﬂ'ense):

2. Pitt (7-1, 4-0): Pitt is set up nicely with three
of its last four games, arguably the tough-
est stretch of its schedule, at Heinz Field.

Now they must ﬁgure out how to get freshman

5. Connecticut (4-3, 1-2): Connecticut, Ithink,
would lose a head—to—head matchup against the
Bulls, who — lest we forget — did beat Flor-
ida State. We’ll ﬁnd out in the last game of the
season, but for now, the Huskies stay at No. 5.
6. Rutgers (5-2, 0-2): The Scarlet Knights haven’t
done anythingto impress anyone. A 17—pointvic-
tory at Army last week doesn’t convince me they
have what it takes to win a Big East road game.
7. Syracuse (3-4, 0-2): Syracuse still couldbecome

well recently, going 1-1-1 in its last three
games and earning its first Big East victory
Wednesday night against Seton Hall.
Sophomore Ryan Brode has had two
goals throughout the last three games.

‘Pitt as a team scored once in the prior

ten matches.

A win against Marquette could pull Pitt
out of the Big East basement as the season
closes. Seton Hall, 1-6-3 in conference play,
faces West Virginia Saturday.

i

If we win the game, we jump
ahead of Seton Hall, and that is
our goal right now.

“We’re going out there to win the game,”

Luxbacher said. “If we win the game, we -

jump ahead of Seton Hall, and that is our
goal right now.” _

Marquette’s student radio station
WMUR will stream an audio broadcast
online starting at 8 p.m.

Wrestling

As one season closes, another opens.
Pitt wrestling starts its season this Sunday
at the Buffalo Open.

Head coach Rande Stottlemyer begins
his 31st season leading the Panthers, who
boast three players ranked in the top 20 of
their respective weight classes.

Intermat ranks senior Jimmy Conroy
14th in the 133-pound weight class.Junior
Ethan Headlee and sophomore Tyler Nau-
man each rank 13th,in the 165-pound and
141—pound weight classes, respectively.

The Panthers hope to repeat the success
of last season, which saw four members

new leader of the team

“They were friends last year and really hit it
off when [Jermaine] got here,” coachjamie Dixon
said. “Ithinkit maybe more common inourpro—
grarn with having older players come back and
stayintouchwintheteam. D

“He’s really interesting in that he had an im-
mediate respect ofhis teammates last yearwhen
he arrived. Thatfs hard to do, especially coming
from junior college, but he sawa role, and he saw
whatwas needed and he relished inthat and took
it on.” _

Dixon cametoPitt afterhis sophomore year at
Tallahassee Community College in Florida. After
two seasonsathisjuniorcollege, he leftwith1,o5o
career points and ranked among school leaders
in points per game (18.1), total ﬁeld goals (372)
and steals (142).

Despite individual success only two seasons
into his college career; it wasn’t a surprise to the
coaching staff to see him come to Pitt.

the court is a result of efforts off the court.

“Lastyear, heworked reallyhard,” Dixon said.
“Earlyint:he season he struggled shootingthe ball
but really put in the extra time before and after
practice. It showed as his 3-point shooting got a
lot better as the season went on.” .

But coaches weren’t the only people who
noticed Dixon’s play and evolution into a leader
for the team. Redshirt freshman Travon Wood-
all, a guard who sat out last season to extend his
NCAA eligibility, said that Dixon brought a lot to
the team last season, despite it being his ﬁst year

“We gotjermaine as a leader,” Woodall said
“He does a great job of showing the youngerguys
lastyear...andIthinkthat’sgoingto help eliminate
that margin for error.”

That’s good news for Panthers fans who have
high expectations for Dixon this season. But jus?
as others hope to see Dixon excel on the court, he
is holding high standards for himself.

“1’ve beeninthis role before,” Dixon said about
his time in junior college. “And I take it up as a
challenge.”
