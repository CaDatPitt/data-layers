UPMC regrows man's ﬁngertip

by Drew Singer
Senior Staﬂ Writer

Three years ago, the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center dis-
played the future of medicine — by
giving a patient the middle ﬁnger. 0.

This wasn’t just any middle

ﬁnger. UPMC 0 gave patient ~lLee

Spievack a new powder that, when ‘
directly applied, allowed Spievack to 0.

regenerate the recently sliced—off tip
of his middle ﬁnger.

‘ It took’ about four weeks for ﬂre
half—inch he had lost in a bloody

model airplane incident to grow

watching advances in this new

Board says more phones

for SafeRider too costly

by Lindsay Carroll
Staﬂ Writer

Even though Pitt’s Student Gov-
ernrnent Board found $60,000 in its
coffers last year to spend on 10 ﬁber-
glass panther statues, the board an-
nounced last night that it would not be
chipping in student money to fund irn—

provements to the SafeRider system

No extra phone lines or vehicles
will be added to improve SafeR-
ider even though it could help relieve
overburdened workers operating on a
single phone line.

SGB member Nila Devanath said

ﬂrat in discussions with transportation .
— oﬁicials, she learned the funding for
these improvements would have to: i

come from the Student Activities Fee.

Devanath said that the $185,000
pricetag of those improvements is a
“huge chunk” of that fee, so instead,
she hopes to promote more effective
communication between SafeRider
workers and students. 0

‘‘There’s not much we can do with

- the money aspect,” she said

She armormced that reports about
how students can better understand
the SafeRider system will be available
on SafeRider buses soon.

Devanath said she learned that the
University can’t mark shuttle stops
with a symbol such as a panther paw,

New technology

erative Medicine call an extracellular matrix.
The institute was founded in conjunction with
the development of the powder.

The matrix, which is made from pig blad-
ders, acts as a -biologic scalfold, _mobilizing
cells to regenerate a missing body part

“While the healing process usually produc-
es scartissue, which is not as strong as normal
tissue, the scalfo1d’s growth factors encourage

the development of strong, healthy tissue,” the '

UPMC Health Journal reported. _

The report added, “As the new tissue grows
across it, the scaffold is harmlessly absorbed by
the body.

No matter where it is placed, the body tends
to turn the scaffolding into

According the UPMC Health Journal, the
technology has helped over 300,000 patients
worldwide, repairing large wounds and her-
nias. The matrix has also helped correct urinary
tract birth defects in infants.

The United States Army is working with
Pitt to see if the technology could help veterans
replace lost limbs or burnt skin. A ~

“It’s hard to ignore that this guy is rniss—
ing half his skin, this guy is missing his leg. Is
there any way we can make that grow back?”
Dr. Steven .Wolf of the U.S. Army Instiulte of
Surgical Research rhetorically asked in an in-
terview with CBS. ’ ‘

“Some of that technology exists,” he said.

While UPMC has been

the type of tissue needed” ‘ ‘
While Spievack only

generate a severed ﬁngertip,

this could be the ﬁrst step

“As, we get into more

Joon Sup Lee told CBS.

Lee injected one of his patientsiwith the ma-
trix directly into their heart with the hopes of the
patient’s body developing new arteries.

UPMC doctors also placed a patch form of
the matrix on another patient’s heart to regener-
ate tissue lost in a heart attack.

Another doctor molded the material in the
shape of an’ esophagus to help" people with
throat cancer. ’

Like the heart patch and model esophagus,

. doctors can mold the powder into any shape

Just the

ing is that these advanced

Dr. Stephen Badylak, director of the Center for
Preclinical Studies at McGowan, said in the

, UPMC Health Journal.

7‘It’s very satisfying to see how our work in
the laboratory is beneﬁting patients and chang-
ing lives,” Badylak said

“The next generation of this material, cur-
rently in development, will make it possible to
regrow heart tissue, blood vessels and arteries,
the esophagus and the wind pipe — and even
whole organs, like the pancreas and liver,” the
report said.

b From Columbine to Virginia‘
?Tech to last month’s incident

 school shootings unfortunately
seem to be on the rise in the
%United States. And no matter
:how safe the campus or how
itight the gun control laws,
 these tragic events can still oc-

. 5 cur. -

But following the massacre

 at Virginia Tech, the Federal
Education Department is hop-
ling to make such catastrophes

 easier to prevent. After ﬁnding

ithat many university ofﬁcials
lwere reluctant to report suspi-
jcious behavior in students for
‘fear of breaching student pri-

 vacy, the department proposed
gnew regulations to clarify the
 Family ‘Educational Rights and
 Privacy Act.

4 The act will undergo minor
ichanges intended to ‘make its
 provisions easier to understand.
iAccording to The New York

Times, lawyers said the modi- .

{ ﬁcations will “stop administra-
 tors from invoking the privacy
 act as an excuse for inaction.”

; S The shooting at Virginia
§Tech killed more than 30 peo-
ple. According to the Times,
Carolyn Rude, the chair of the
5 English Department at Virginia
 Tech, said of shooter Seung-
; Hui Cho, “There were signs
that he was troubled.” Rude
7 said, without revealing details,
} that the English. department in-
 tervened. But a report by a pan-
 el named by Virginia Gov. Tim
§,Kaine found that there were
imisunderstandings about the
 privacy laws among university
 ofﬁcials, which prevented them

 from exchanging Cho’s mental

ier to do just that.

health information and taking
further action.

Had university ofﬁcials bet-
ter understood the privacy act
and reported shooter Seung—

Hui Cho’s mental health prob— ‘

lems to the appropriate people,
the tragedy could have been
prevented. T

But while clarifying the
privacy rules is a positive that
could prevent future shootings,
it is not enough. University of-
ﬁcials should be educated on
the ins and outs of the law so
that they will know how much
authority they have in report-
ing suspicious-behavior. '

University ofﬁcials should
also be careful and report stu-
dents only after a close exami-
nation of their behavior. Oth-

erwise, it is likely that anyone

with seemingly strange behav-

ior who does not ﬁt a particular

social mold could be reported.
Furthermore, ofﬁcials

should not take advantage of .
_ the law to report students to the '

police as if they are criminals.
Rather, the goal should be to
notify counselors or help cen-
ters in order to try and assist

- students with potentially dan-

gerous problems. Privacy stan-
dards should be clearer so that
more people can acquire help,
not so the police can keep tabs
on students.

In today’s society, where vi-

olence seems to be increasing ’

everyday, the only reasonable
solution to school shootings is

found at the source ‘— helping .

those ‘who show-signs of suspi-
cious behavior. And with these

New names, different meanings

by Sam Ginsburg

Cola/nnidt

Some people don’t think
na_mes are important. Some peo-
ple actually believe that names
arenothing more-than arbitrary
labels. Shakespea're’s Juliet
once said of her middle school
sweetheart Romeo, “What’s in
a name? That which we call a
rose, by any other word would
smell just as sweet.” But look
at how she ended up: dead. So,
for your own personal safety,
you might want to continue
reading and learn more about
the importance of names.

One really cannot under-

stand the importance of a name _

until someone tries to change
it. Sure, the roses will smell

just as good, but do you really ‘

want to tell someone “Hey, I
bought you all these diapers for
Valentine’s Day,” or, “Pick up
a bouquet of feet onyour way
home”? It just doesn’t sound
right. And it’s just as bad when
other names we have gotten
used to change, too. ,
Kentucky Fried Chicken,
that magical wonderland of
crispy strips and coleslaw,
where cherubs cry gravy and

unicoms swim in pools of

‘ macaroni and cheese, is trying

to go healthy. But they couldn’t
just create some lighter sides
or .smaller portions; they de-
cided to destroy the scrump-
tious fou_nd_ation that Colonel
Harland Sanders built with
his own bare hands, right after
he single-handedly ended the
Great Depression.

According to MSN Mon-
ey, for the ﬁrst time in over

'50 years, KFC will be selling:

grilled chicken. It’s not even
grilled chicken that they will
later batter and fry. "They are
actually planning to serve it
naked, vulnerable and alone in
this cruel world.

This would be bad enough
if it wasn’t for the extra twist
that Yum Foods is putting on
the. knife in their customers’

stomachs. .As part of this new “

promotion, they are planning
on changing a number of store-
front signs to Kentucky Grilled
Chicken. KGC? Really? That
sounds moreilike a Soviet se-

curity agency than a delicious .

haven of biscuits and buffalo
sauce.

Another name change that
is rocking the infrastructure of
our country is going on out in
Los Angeles. As reported by

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews,com

O

TMZ.c‘om, music industry and
Disney star_ Miley Cyrus has
legally changed hername to,
well, Miley Cyrus. As it turns
out, her actual birth name was
Destiny Hope Cyrus, but the
young celebrity decided with
her parents that it would be
easier to legally switch to her
more popular stage name.

I don’t know about you
guys, but this really cleared
things up from me. The fewer
names you use for one thing,
the easier it is to keep track of
it. With Destiny Hope out of
the picture, this cuts the list of
Miley’s names down to only
three, including her false per-
sona Hannah Montana and, my
personal favorite, That Girl My
Neighbor is Counting Down
to Her 18th Birthday For. Oh,
TGMNiCDtH18BF, we barely

9 knew you.

And, since we can all relate
to running fast andsigning bil-
lion dollar endorsement deals,
organized ‘sports are once
again acting as a metaphor- for
life. This name-changing phe-
nomenon has infected the oth-
erwise clean world of athletics.
I’m not talking about the Tam-
pa Bay Devil Rays exorcising
the Devil out of their name.

Taking wild lessons from Hannah Montana

by Jen Lue

Colupniz/zzl4t

As a prepubescent girl with
big dreams, a heart of gold
and a mouth full of orthodon-
tia, I often suffered from de-
lusions of grandeur .concern-
ing spring break, all of which
involved me displaying mini-
.mal amounts of tasteful nudi-
ty on MTV, rubbing sunscreen
on a wel1—built Swede by the
name _of Peter Bjorn John and
sipping a fruity - cocktail on
the sunny shores of Cabo San
Lucas. i

There are particular points
in my life when this vision re-
ally hit home for me (Just to
name a.few, “She’s All That”
— the scene where -Fred-
die Prinze Jr. gets his heart
broken by teen queen Taylor
Vaughn, most of Mary-Kate’s
and Ashley’s “Holiday In The
Sun,” all of “The Real World:
Hawaii,” Season Eight).

So,‘ when I learned that"

I would be spending the en-
tirety of my break back home
in Glen Mills, Pa., I decided
to make my life as close to

a “Girls Gone Wild in Phila-

Name-

Ginsburg, page 10

I’m not even talking about the

Tribune Company feeling for’
' deals to sell the naming rights

of Wrigley Field, the 94-year-
old legendary home of the Chi-

' cago Cubs.

No, I’m talking about
something even more ridicu-
lous, something that typiﬁes
our societies’ newfound apa-
thy toward name solidarity. In
1995," the Boston Celtics left
the famed Boston Garden for

delphia ’O8” video as I could
(minus the triple nipple XXX-
posure). ,

Like a hypothetical Vanes-
sa Anne Hudgens would say,
I had nothing left to lose but
my dignity.

Imagine my disappoint-
ment when I arrived in my
hometown only to findhigh
school kids ‘drinking Wawa
fruit punch and talking abou
the Eagles. '

I-spent my time drowning

. my sorrows in the comfort of

Ryan Gosling films, sausage
madetfrom the hands of real
Pennsylvania Dutchmen and
IKEA’s Swedish ‘meatball
combo. ,

In between trips to Target

and the farmer’s market, I

was given the best of what my
local radio station had to of-
fer. This included Paramore’s
“Misery Business” put’ on
Continuous repeat. Through it
all,'I was able to s_urvive by
the’ sheer strength that Miley
Cyrus offered me.

That’s right, Miley Cyrus’.
Much in the same vein as
other Disney superstars (Hil-
lary Duff, Ashley Tisdale,

Raven Symone), little Ms.
Hannah Montana is using
her child stardom to make _it
big in the real-entertainment
industry. When I first heard
her latest single, “See You
Again,” taken off the album
“Hannah Montana 2: Meet
Miley Cyrus,” my initial reac-
tion was, “Who is this sassy,
southern, 30-year-old mother
of two, and what is she sing-
ing to me about?” *

When I learned that this
supposed ‘trailer park mama
was none other" than the 15-
year—old daughter of a one-hit
wonder country singer, I was
impressed. ’ -. '

As I listened to her lyrics,
I was struck by a revelation
that shook me harder than Ar-
nold Schwarzenegger shook a
13-year-old Alyssa Milano in
the opening montage of the

' 1985 film “Commando,” and

that is this: Cyrus has depth.

Here aresome of themany
life lessons that she "taught
me from the song “See You
Again”:

1. Love is a Battlefield:
“I got my sights set on you
and I’m ready to aim”

tion

Cyrus is a warrior. She is
willing to go the extra mile in
order to get you to notice her,
and she urges that all her lis-
teners do the same.

2. Reincarna-
and _ Intuition:

“I’ve got a way of know-
ing when something is right,
I feel like I must have known
you in another life”

Cyrus is a philosopher.
Here,’ Cyrus touches _on a
deep subject that many Bud-
dhist monks and theorists
have struggled with for centu-
ries. She boldly declares that
she has the innate abilities of
intuition that tell her when a
boy is or is not right-for her.

She goes on to state that-

she believes she ha_s known
this love interest (who I can
only speculate is a Jonas
Brother) in a previous life.

3. Avoidance: '
“The last time I freaked out,
I just kept looking down” 4

Here, Cyrus is describ-
ing the perfect solution to all
problems: avoidance. Prompt-
ly after listening to this song,
I decided to stop filing tax re-

turns.

4. Thoughts on Speech
Impediments and Being
Comfortable With Yourself:

“I st—st—stuttered when

you asked me what
I’m thinking about,
Felt like I couldn’t breathe,
You i asked what’s
wrong with me,

My best friend Lesley said,
“Oh, she’-s just being Miley”
She brings to light the im-
portant issue of speech imped-
iments, which often carry an
unnecessarily negative stigma
in today’s society and tells us

_that it’s OK to just let go and

be ourselves sometimes. In
Miley’s case, this means be-
ing an underage billionaire.
Wow, right? Miley Cyrus
taught me the way that true
girls go wild and that is for the
boy they love. So, although
my spring break did not con-
sist of Cancun, bikinis and
the Olsen twins, I can safely

’ say that the words of wisdom

that Hannah Montana gave
me made it all worthwhile.

changing taking country by storm

a state-of-the-art facility called

the FleetCenter. This was ﬁne
and all, until Fleet Bank was .

bought by TD Banknorth. Since
Fleet didn’t exist anymore,
they were forced to change ihe
name to TD Banknorth Garden,
with the “Garden” part a sup-I
posedtribute to the old historic
arena. _

The only problem is, it seems
as if the banking world is just
about as stable as a freshman

walking home on a Saturday
night. TD Banknorth is now
purchasing Commerce Bancorp
for $ 9 billion and changing its
name to TD Commerce Bank,
meaning the name ‘of the arena
will have to change" again. This
might not seem like a big deal,
but it is. How is Kevin Garnett
supposed to lead the Celtics to
a sweep over the Lakers in the
NBA ﬁnals if he doesn’t even
know the name of his place of

work? Even MVPs need name-
stability in their lives.
Sometimes name changes
make sense. Lew Alcindor
sounds like a classical violin
player, but Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar sounds like one of the
greatest basketball players
and actors of all time." Some-

times, however they doi'i’t. Cat‘

Stevens sounds like a singer-
songwriter," while Yusuf Islam
sounds like, well, I don’t even

know.

I think people should just
stick-to the names they got. Life
is confusing enough. We don’t
need people running around in
anarchy, calling things whatev-
er names they please. We need
structure. We need rules. We
need to wake up and smell the
feet.

They might not be real, but TV.dads can
be just as beloved and revered as the real
deals that work two jobs to put many of us
through college. We can learn from them,
laugh along with their misguided parenting
or just be in awe at the lengths they’re will-
ing to go for the sake of family.

This was originally going to be a Fa-
ther’s Day piece, but since this holidayis
during the summer, I feel it has to be done .
now, especially since I’m running out of
ideas — if that wasn’t already painfully ob-
vious. Keep in mind that my knowledge of
televised paternal ﬁgures doesn’t really pre-
cede 1985, so feel free to disagree all you
want:

Tim Taylor of “Home Improvement” -
The -ultimate in manliness as portrayed by
Tim Allen, Tim was all about “more power”
in even the most menial of appliances -

you never know when a garbage disposal

will need to serve as a wood chipper.

But underneath that testosterone over-
load was a father who loves his sons and
wife dearly, offering life lessons and meth-
ods to juice up a lawn mower. His inven-
tions were borderline incompetent, but his -
parenting was top notch. Sure, “Home Im-
provement” was a comedy, but there was a
surprising amount of touching father—son
bonding and _hilarious1y romantic moments

.that make Tim Taylor the man in father-

hood.

Homer Simpson of “The Sirnpsons” —
Pretty much the mold in buffoonery that
refuses to be broken, thanks to Dan Castel-'
laneta’s trademark “D’oh!” He might lack
common sense, but he refuses to leave his
family or do anything that would tear it
apart (intentionally, anyway). He even cried

— when the prospect of cheating on Marge

presented itself in a fortune cookie (they’re‘
sweet and tasty) and a hot girl sharing his
hotel room.

The crayon in his brain might diminish
his brainpower to near-handicapped levels,
but it doesn’t seem to affect his duty as all
around caretaker to America’s most beloved

This had to be a joke. -

for comedic value, I perused the products

“stop blaming the dog” and “I’m tired of

arrived at a miraculous epiphany: This
product is real.

ond and third movements will be presented

tonight, with the fourth and ﬁnalto be re-
served until the season’s ﬁnal concert — a
classical music cliffhanger, if you will.

Music

F olkie’s best tour
finally on disc

by Donald Campbell
Staﬂ Writer

 

If one thinks about themost inﬂuential
artists of the Vremam era, some very big
names immediately come to mind. Bands
like The Beatles seemed to champion the
“druggier” side of the ’60s and Simon and
Garfunkel seemed to epitomize the lighter,
ajrier side. There is no doubt that Simon and
Garfunkel immediately became popular in
an era when the country was divided by war
both abroad and at home. Simon & Gamm-
kel, Live 1969, recently released, is an indi-
cation of Simon and Garfunkel’s continued
popularity with a new generation.

Countless re—mastered versions of Simon
and Garfunkel albums
have been made since the
official ending of their
relationship, including
their famous Bridge over
Troubled Water and Pars- 
ley, Sage, Rosemary and 
Thyme. Simon and Gar- "
funkel songs continue to .
fascinate moviemakers,
and they regularly appear in modemﬂicks.

Despite all this attention, however, there
have been no releases of their capstone 1969
tour. Even the fact that the tour occurred
right before the two went on a rather long
hiatus failed to spur much interest.

Now, though, from Sony Entertajmnent
comes a re-mastered — and original —.— re-
lease of Simon and Garfunkel’s 1969 tour,
complete with original recordings from per-
formances at various tour stops. The album
serves as a ﬁttingly spectacular conclusion
to the duo’s career. It is an exceptional col-
lection of Simon and Garfunkel classics per-
formed in a way many younger fans of the
band have yet to experience.

The collection includes selections from
the tour representative of Simon and Gar-
funkel’s most famous albums, including
Bridge over Troubled’ Waters and Parsley,
Sage, Rosemary and Thyme and Bookends.
The major highlights are Simon and Garfun-
kel’s most popular songs, including “Home—
ward Bound,” “I Am a Rock,” “The Boxer”

 

and, of course, “The Sound of Silence.”
The quality of CD recording brings the
best of both 1969 and 2008. The clarity of the
CD picks up everything that is happening on
stage, allowing the listener to feel as if he is
really standing in front of Art Garfunkel and
Paul Simon, playing their favorite songs on
stage. The same clarity conversely records
some of the impurities of the 1969 record-
ing equipment, giving the songs a distinctly
vintage feel that many. college-aged Simon
and Garfunkel fans have come to adore.

‘ There is always something attractive
aboutia live album, and this effort is noth-
ing different. The live aspect. gives the songs
some humanity over their impeccably cho-
reographed studio equivalents. Many listen-
ers are used to the single version of “The
Sound of Silence,” complete with studio—re-
corded drums and guitar. In the live‘ edition
featured on this album, the only percussion
is provided by Paul Simon tapping lightly on
his acoustic guitar. The rest of the quality of
the song arises from the feeling put into the
lyrics by Simon and Garﬁ1nkel’s singing.
« » 7- Other songs, like “The
Boxer,” include small
improvisations that make
the rendition unique de-
spite being well known.

A For any “oldies” fans of
 Simon and Garfunkel,

 
   

an exceptional addition

Courtesy Sony BMG Music Entertainrnent to any  collection The

original LPs take the listener back-to the way
Simon and Garfunkel sounded to fans of the
late ’60s and early ’70s, as they listened at

’ this new tour provides,

home. The CD brings the listener closer to 7

how Simon and Garfunkel sounded to those
fans lucky enough to see them in concert in
Detroit, Toledo, St. Louis or New York.

An added bonus of the collection is its
case, which provides pictures of both Paul
Simon and Art Garﬁmkel as they toured in
1969. Also included is a booklet with litera-
ture explaining the creation of the album,
thetour itself and basic history about the rise
and end of Simon and Garfunkel’s collab-
orative efforts.

If you really like Simon and Garfunkel,
you should notice that you already have three

. or four copies of each song listed on this al-

bum. This is not at all a problem, though, for
as a live album, each song featured has its
own unique quality, complete with impro-
visations, new and different inﬂections and
slight guitar embellishments. You would do
well to add this CD to your-library.

Fart cushion, page ‘I2

Not only was the relatively thin cush-
ion surprisingly comfortable, but no matter
how hard I tried, the aroma of my usually
zesty outbursts seemed nonexistent.

Out of fear of being too easy on my oc-
casionally odoriferous self, I enlisted the
toughest critic I know: my girlfriend.

Several minutes later, with my diges-
tive system running on all cylinders, she
reluctantly took a thorough sniff.

“I can’t smell a thing, that cushion is

' great,” she said, awestruck. “Can we keep

it?” ' g

The cushions are available online for
$24.95 plus shipping. GasBGon also offers
underpants and face masks, along with re-
placement carbon ﬁlters for $10.95 a pop.

The products come with a tally chart
that, if you really want to, you can mark
off every time you break wind. The chart
recommends replacing a carbon ﬁlter ev-
ery 435 expulsions.

In addition to the chart, the 324 square
inch product came with instructions—“Sit
& Rip” — along with a; note that they can
be hand-washed and air-dried. All cushions
are the same size.

A Pitt chemistry professor who asked to

remain nameless — apparently fart cush-
ions aren’t the most reputable ﬁeld in mod-
ern science — said that the ﬁlter works just
like a water ﬁlter you’d put on your fau-
cet.

“The only thing that’s different here is

the particulates are a hell of a lot smaller,”

the professor said. “They’re particular mol-
ecules instead of being pieces of dirt or salt

that’s in the water supply. It’s essentially‘

the same thing.”

After returning the cushion to The’ Pitt
News ofﬁce —- to the dismay of my girl-
friend — I decided that the product had
earned my respect. With a collective four
thumbs—up from my critic and me, the tale
of how GasBGon came to be deserves to
be told.

Like many great inventions, the product
emerged from a chance occurrence.

“I was hosting a pig pickin’ party,” Huza
said. “They take a whole pig, and there are

baked beans, broccoli salads, cabbage cas-

seroles and a whole bunch of brewskies.
We were having a blast, pardon the pun.”
Then, destiny took over.
“It started to rain, and the party moved

inside. The smell in that house was a mess

to knock you off your feet,” Huza said. “It
was disgusting.”

Huza asked her husband, Jim, an en-
gineer, to create something to ensure the
pungent predicament would never again
spoil their pig pickin’ parties.

Jim then designed a carbon ﬁlter with
the hopes of ridding the redolence once

and for all. Once the prototype was cre-

ated, the Huzas tested the product in the
only, way they knew how.

“We supplied the beer, and people
would sit and pass gas all day. They would
have to sniff the air and see what they could
smell,” she said. “It was so much fun.”

Huza said she and her husband came up
with all of the product names themselves.
With available items including the “Back
Pass” soccer-themed cushion and the “Al-
ley OOPS” bowling cushion, Huza ex-
plained the thorough process behind nam-
ing a product.

. “My husband I would get a bottle of
wine or a couple of brewskies and come
up with the names,” Huza said. “We sold
out the ‘Tush Down’ football pillow after
the last Super Bowl.

Despite ‘the humorous nature of the

-

  Cushion makes it safe to eatburritos 

product, Huza said that ﬂatulence can be a
serious problem for some.

. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of’

people who suffer and don’t have a social
life because of it,” she said, citing both
natural gas problems and those induced by
medication.

“The average person passes gas 14

times a day, and if you’re not passing gas” '

you need too get to'a doctor right away,”
she said. , '
For those of you playing along at
home, 14 farts per day means about 420
per month, just 15 less than the product’s
threshold. Buyinga new carbon ﬁlter ever
31 days may become pricey, but how much

A is too much for a funk—free household?

Through her research, Huza came upon
a stunning discovery.
“Females buy more than males,” she,

said. “And” it’s not to get it for their better" 7

half. There are statistics that will show you
-that when a female passes gas, the odor is
more potent than a man’s.” _ .

Female or male, this product is worth a
look—see not only for a good laugh, but be-
cause it truly does do as promised: “Clear
the air, not the room.”

Don't steam over Pitt's season

 

Senior Staﬂ U7/‘dc/‘

Bob Knight mania had ofﬁcially infected
the entire Pitt campus.

The legendary coach and current ESPN
ana1yst’s sentiments echoed through the
University’s libraries, classrooms and dor-
mitories: The Panthers were going to win the
national championship.

Away messages proclaimed Knight as a
“genius,” a “stud” and a “hero.”

Knight raved about the team’s heart and
the focus of its ﬂoor general, Levance Fields,
since returning from a broken foot several
weeks ago. And we started to believe.

Then Pitt roared through the ﬁrst round
of the NCAA Tournament, embanassing an
overwhelmed Oral Roberts squad and seem-
ingly burying shots at will. And we continu
to believe. 1

And then, as quickly as our blatantly ab-
surd aspirations had been built, a team just
as inconsistent as our own Panthers crushed
those desires. '

We watched as shot after shot clanked off
the iron and fell into the hands of the Spar-
tans. We watched as the combination of a
savvy senior guard and a fearless freshman

guard carved apart our own stingy defense.

With college basketball aplenty, a new base-

_ NBA playotfs coming up, it’s a wonder why

football would gamer any headlines right now. ,

Yet the NFL has made sure it’s still on the

this is by proposing aban on longhair.

It was reported by the NFL Network that
the Kansas City Chiefs proposed a new rule in
which players wouldn’t be allowed to wear their
hair long or ﬂowing out of the back of their hel-

on the issue later in the month at a meeting in

‘ Cu Pitt thleti

Not even small ball helped Jordan Herr and the Pitt baseball team over the weekend]
The Panthers lost three games to W V U to open the Big East regular season.

by Zack Chakan
Staﬂ Writer

Coming off of  wins in four games
in last week’s Papa John’s Challenge, the Pit
baseball team looked primed for a successful
starttoits BigEastseason atWestV1rginiathis
past weekend.

The Mountaineers had other ideas.

West Virginia dismantled the Panthers in all
three contests at Hawley Field in Morgantown,
sending Pitt to four consecutive defeats overall.

The tough weekend dropped Pitt’s 
to 6-11 overall and 0-3 in Big East play. The
Mountaineers improved their tally to 16-4 and
3-0 in the conference with the trio of victories.

The ultimate culprit for the Panthers was
perhaps their strong point coming into the se-
ries, their starting pitching. '

In the three contests, Pitt’s starting pitchers‘

hree-game series

gave up 24 earned runs and 29 overall runs in
only 9 2/3 innings of work

' The initial aﬂ°air on Thursday was the hard-
est on the Panthers. West Virginia scored 12
runs in the ﬁrst inning alone and held on for a
15-12 win

The Mountaineers were victorious on Fri-
day and Saturday, as well, winning 12-6 and
8-1, respectively. .

Despite the overwhehning numbers put up
by West Virginia early in the games, Pitt found
several positives on the weekend.

The relief pitching particularly stood out
in all three games. Four relievers combined to
give up only three earned runs in 14 and one-
third innings of work All three of those runs
came in the middle game.

Pitt’s offense also showed a never—give—up
mentality, mounting rallies in each game 
starting each down by a large margin.

And we witnessed the normally boisterous
and jubilant DeJuan Blair dejectedly work
his, way through the post-game handshakes
before sullenly plodding off the court.

So what do we make of all of this? _

Well, once the disappoirltment dissipates,
it will be time for some serious reﬂection and
appreciation for what this team has accom-
plished this year. .

At the begimling of the season, many fans
and ahalysts considered Pitt a bottom feeder
of the Big East, a likely NIT squad, a position
the ‘Panthers haven’t experienced in nearly a
decade. ‘ ‘ '

Then, Pitt suifered a letdown inthe fol-

Fields broke his foot during theloss, and he,
too, was to be sidelined for an extensive pe-
riod ofutime. All of a sudden, the University’s
expectations were lowered, and once again
the Panthers looked like they might not get
an NCAA Tournament bid.

Georgetown, however, reinvigorated fans
with optimism. The Panthers continued to

As the NFL Netwo1:k’s Adam Schefter

nament prior to the Big East tournament.

Rather than settle for just having a slot
reserved in the Big Dance, Pitt stormed
through the conference tournament, upset-
ting Louisville, Marquette and Georgetown
along the way, en route to its second Big East
championship ever. '

Fields appeared completely recovered,
the offense was ﬁxing on all cylinders, and
the defense, as it has tended to do in the past,
ﬁghtened up tremendously and wreaked hav-
oc against, larger opponents like the Hoyas’
Hibbert. ’ ,

Then Knight dropped a bomb that con-
vinced Pitt fans, ESPN analysts andmost of
the free world that the Panthers were, in fact,
serious contenders heading into the NCAA
tournament. ' - ‘

Against our own good judgment, we
bought into the hype because we wanted to.

So now that the dream is over, let’s re-
memberjand be grateful for what these men
did. ' .
Overcoming low expectations, injuries
and inconsistency, this team gave us our
ﬁrst Big East championship since Brandin

"Knight, the team’s current co—director of

Basketball Operations, was nmning (the of-
fense.

We_ had many opportunities to celebrate
this season and should consider ourselves
lucky to have ever realistically believed that
perhaps this team could attain the sport’s ul-
timate prize. -

What about jersey numbers?

Also, long hair is a distinction. It’s much
easier to recognize a player with long hair in the
middle of a game, while action is going on, thari
a player without long hair. Wouldn’t making a
player cut their long hair, or hide it in their hel-

Sure, you can read their name on the back

Baseball, page 17

Outﬁelder Sean Conley stayed hot, launch-
ing his sixth home run of the year in Thursday’s
game. He smacked three over the fence in the
Papa John’s Challenge, giving him four in his
last seven games.

Joe Leonard, Morgan Kielty and Danny
Lopez all connected for home runs as well in
the series. Lopez recorded ﬁve RBIs on the
weekend.

The Panthers look to bounce back today
on the road against Ohio State at 2:05 p.m. in
a nonconference battle. Pitt then will prepare
for its ﬁrst home series of the year, three games
against Big East foe Louisville that begin on
Friday.

WVU 15, Pitt 12

The Mountaineers got on the board early
and often against Pitt, tallying a whopping 12
mns in the ﬁrst inning. But they had to with-
stand a furious Pitt comeback to hold on by
only three runs.

West Virginia totaled 12 hits in the ﬁrst in-
ning to go along with 12 runs and ﬁnished with
19 hits on the game. But Pitt didn’t go away
quieﬂy.

The Panthers manufactured runs with walks
and hit-by-pitches in the second and third in-
nings. ‘

Pitt scored nine runs within the two innings
to lower the deﬁcit to 12-9.

Pitt starter Nate Reed received the loss, strik-
ing out ﬁve batters in three innings. Freshman
reliever Corey Baker gave up only three hits
and no earned runs while pitching ﬁve innings.

WVU12,Pitt6

Pitt once again found itselfin an insurmount-
able hole on Friday, this time with the help of
some defensive rniscues. By the time the dust
cleared, Pitt was down 10-0 after six innings.

Leonard ﬁnally put the Panthers on the
board with a solo shot in the top of the sevenﬂi.
Pitt added another run in the inning, but West
V1rgir1ia got those runs back with one each in
the seventh and eighth innings.

Pitt scored four more runs in the ninth, refus-
ing to give up. Kielty hit his ﬁrst home nm of
the year, ﬁnishing off a 2-for-5 day at the plate.
Freshman right ﬁelder John Schultz went 3 for
3 in the contest _

Rob Brant was saddled wiﬂi the loss, his
second of the season.

WVU8,Pitt1

Lopez and freshman reliever David Kaye
turned in standout performances in Pitt’s ﬁnal
loss of the weekend, an 8~1 defeat on Saturday.

The Panthers only had three hits in the
game, but Lopez had two of them, including a
solo home run that accounted for Pitt’s only 11111
of the affair.

Kaye pitched ﬁve hitless innings in relief of
starter Brian Chrisman, who gave up eight runs

did Ricky Williams while he was on the D01-
phins.

It’s_ amusing the Chiefs suggested this, see-
ing as how they were involved with one of the
more aggressive hair pulls in recent memory. In
October of 2006, against the Steelers, Polamalu
had intercepted a pass and was nrnning down
the sideline when Larry Johnson ran up from
behind him and yanked him to the ground sole-
ly using his hair. Johnson continued to pull the
hair even after he brought down Polamalu, and

was given an unnecessary roughness penalty.

If the NFL wants to ban something that’s a
safety hazard to its players, ban them from be-
ing around televisions.

That’s right, make sure no players are al-
lowed to own or watch that magical box of
goodness that you and I love oh so much.

Last week Denver Broncos wide receiver

‘Brandon Marshall severed an artery, a vein and g

a nerve in his forearm, as well as tendons to
ﬁve muscles after slipping and putting his arm
through a TV, the Associated Press reported
Marshall, who underwent surgery on Saturday,
is expected to be out around three months.

' When it was ﬁrst reported, Marshall said he

slipped on a McDonald’s wrapper, sending his
arm through the TV. A few days later he admit-
ted to wrestlinga family member while the in-
cident happened. 5

So why hasn’t the NFL sprung into action
here? There isn’t any documented evidence of a
player missing time because his hair was pulled,
sowhy isthatmore ofasafety issue thanTVs?

The only logical reason is that the NFL own-

7 ers have an under/over bet of 40 websites and

newspapers using the always-hilarious “Hair
Today, Gone Tomorrow” headline.
