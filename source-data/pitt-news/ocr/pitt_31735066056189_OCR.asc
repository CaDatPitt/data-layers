BAS says cultural
center would be
beneﬁcial to all

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

An African—American cultural center would be inclusive,
not exclusive, according to Keith Davis, chair of the Black
Action Society.

“It will not _be exclusive to African—American concerns or
problems,” Davis said, during a presentation supporting

.the proposed cultural center Tuesday night at a meeting of

the University Democrats.

When asked if the center would be multicultural, includ-
ing Latino/Hispanic, Asian or American Indian interests,
Davis said other groups would be able to have temporary
exhibits. ,

“The focal point will be strictly African American and
Africans across the diaspora. It will be multicultural under
the realm of African Americans,” he said. “I support any
idea of Latinos or Asians or American Indians to have their
own cultural center, but the focal point [of this presenta-
tionl is on an African-American cultural center.”

Responding to concerns about isolation or intimidation
of other ethnic groups in classes that would be held in the
center, Davis said, “It will not be a place of isolation but of
inclusion.” " ‘ '

Among several reasons Davis listed for the center: a need
to improve minority recruitment and retention, a percep-
tioniby African-American students of an unfavorable
atmosphere and
results from a survey that showed “acts of racism and acts
of isolation.” '

“'There’s a deﬁnite need for a cultural center  for one
identifiable space on campus. For African—American stu-
dents, it will provide a campus "home,’” Davis said. “A cen-
ter will provide a basis for African—American students to
thrive. It will include offices for black fraternities and soror-
ities.”

The three main points in the proposal submitted by the
BAS were: , ,

-Providing social, cultural, academic and professional
support to the African—American community, on and off-
campus.

-Enhancing the opportunities for multicultural aware-

ness and exposure for students of all racial and ethnic

BAS, Pitt News clash over coverage

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The Black Action Society gen-
eral assembly convened last
night despite repeated protests
by BAS officials concerning The
Pitt News coverage of the event.

“This is a meeting for members
only, no one else will be permit-
ted at this meeting. The BAS gen-
eral assembly is meeting to dis-
cuss’ internal matters,” BAS
Deputy Chair Michael Barge told
The Pitt News.

The meeting, held in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom, was
attended by at least two people
who told The Pitt News during
the meeting that they were not
members of BAS.

“Where are their names?"
Barge said. "I can’t count it as a
credible report if you can’t tell
me their names.”

When asked why the general

- L c -._-a. .,.



assembly closed the meeting, he
said it was not an information
session for the public. According
to Barge, plenty of other oppor-
tunities existed for the general
public to find out about BAS
activities. I

Political Action Chair Oscar
Eybers said there were more
important reasons for closing the
meeting.

“Our ancestors had no privacy,
they could not even go to church
without being watched,” Eybers
said. “We want you to leave so
we have the privacy to meet as a
family.”

“We do not appreciate people
‘intruding on our family,” Barge
said. Two weeks ago, The Pitt
News printed an article about
several controversial comments
made by Eybers. Tensions have
mounted as BAS officials refused
to talk to The Pitt News at the

Indaba the following Friday and

called campus police on Pill
/Vezus’ reporters at the Ind-aba
picnic on Sunday. Recently, BAS
has distributed leaflets critical of
The Pill /\4’ez1«‘.\"' coverage of BAS
events.“\‘</hy are we being
harassed?” Barge said. “We
should be able to meet internally
and resolve issues. It seems like
you are trying to tell us how to
run our organi'/.ation."

Most students at the meeting
declined comment on any aspect
of the controversy. “I imagine
that’s what [the BAS leadership]
thinks is best for the black stu-
dent body,” member Stacey
Mannings said about the way
BAS has conducted itself.

When BAS officials chose to
start the meeting, The Pill ;\'ew.s‘
coverage was not ignored

“We are carrying on this meet-
ing despite the fact our privacy is
being violated,” Eybers said. “We

Class of 1997 a diverse group, says Admissions

Well the 1993-94 school year
has begun, and the numbers are
in. The University of Pittsburgh
has enrolled its 206th Freshman
Class, and once again, the class
is bigger and better than ever
before.

As the upperclass students get
reacquainted and the first—year
students settle in, we thought
you might be interested to
know a little bit about the new
kids on the block.

Every year the Office of

Admissions and Financial Aid.
A reviews thousands of applica-

tions for admission. For the 93-
94 year, Pitt received 8,596 first-
year student applications and
1,965 transfer applications.

Out of the first-year student
applications, 6,386 were adrnit-

J ted to the Pittsburgh campus,

1,099 were referred and admit-
ted to regional campuses and
253 were referred and admitted
to the College of General
Studies.

Of those. admitted to the
Pittsburgh campus, 2,555 paid
their tuition deposit. Eighty-five

percent of the deposit—paid stu-
dents are enrolled in the
College of Arts and Sciences.

(Some were enrolled for the’

summer through the Summer

variety of backgrounds and
socio-economic situations.
Approximately 60 percent of the
first-year class receives some
sort of financial assistance.
Nearly 16 percent are members

and others enrolled of minority
through the groups,
University Challenge and 11
for Excellence percent of

Programs.) Eleven
percent are enrolled
in the School of
Engineering and the
Engineering IMPACT
Program, and 4 per-
cent in the School of
Nursing. Nearly'23
percent of the
incoming first—year
students are undecided about
their intended major, and for
the first time in over three years,
pre—med beat engineering as the
most popular intended field of
study.

Members of the first-year class
range in age from 17 to 25. Over
380 of the new first—year stu-
dents have a relative who
attended Pitt. They come from a

This year’s

and only

male.

Not only are they a diverse
group, but they’re smart too!
Over 50 percent of this first—year
class graduated in the top quin-
tile of their graduating high
school class. Their average
combined SAT score jumped
more than 20 points over last
year’s first-year class.

So where do these talented

young students come from?
Everywhere! They represent 905
zip codes from across the
United States and several for-
eign countries. They come from
801 high schools in 33 states.
Although 87 percent are from
Pennsylvania, and 24 percent of
those are from within Allegheny
County, the remaining 13 per-
cent came _from states as far
away as Alaska and countries as
far away as Spain. Some came
from graduating classes larger
than 800, and there is one stu-

dent who was one of only five

graduates from Bethel Christian
Academy.

Even though the University of
Pittsburgh practices “rolling
admissions,” which means that
Pitt reviews applications as it
receives them and admits on‘ an
on-going basis, there is a begin-
ning and an end to each cycle.
As you can see, there is more to
the new first-year class than
meets the eye.

America is a “mosaic where
each individual is a different tile
who keeps his or her own iden-
tity, but when you step back
you get a wonderful, "larger
view,” Pitt Chancellor _I. Dennis
O’Connor said, setting the tone

for divfeifsit_y week’ at y€_Sterday"s A

International‘ Fair.

The fair served as a chance
not only to celebrate diversity,
but to gain knowledge and a
better understanding of those
around us and to actually expe-
rience each other’s differences
firsthand, according to Director
of Student Activities Joe Cavalla.
“It’s a chance to get to know
each other,” he said.

The International Fair consist-
ed of innumerable cultural stu-
dent associations such as the
Turkish American, Pakistan,
Malaysian and Indonesian
Student As.sociation. Plillel

Spending a semester at sea is

_O’Donnell said that the
seminar is part of a national
campaign to increase public
awareness of mental illness
and_:to. decrease the stigma
attaciied to it. ’

The treatment of depres-"
sion provides psychology

with one of its biggest suc-
cess stories. - r
NIMH estimates that over

. 80 perce.nt of the cases of

depression can be success-

fully.

It can be treated by using
psychotherapy, drugs or
a combination" of both.
“Treatment is based on
the individual’s history
and symptoms,” O’DOnnell
said.

Depression is a medical ill-
ness which can affect any—.
one, O”Donnell said.

\Y/omen’s issues have

come to the forefront! of ‘psy-

chiatry in recent years.
Psycliiatry has come to real-
i'/.e that women have many
different needs and prob-
lems than men, according to
O’Donnell. Postpartum
depression and severe PMS

are examples of biological
problems women may devel-
op. '

‘Women are also more vul-
nerable to some environ-

mental -factors such as rape,"
sexual .discri‘minatio_n and
lingle parenting. _ 
V In the past, O’Donnell said

most studies included only
men. The newtrend takes
into account that women

.may be.affected by certain

illness in greater numbers
than men.

According to NIMH, Over
11 million‘ Americans
are depressed. Some of
the symptoms of depression
are: change in sleep and
appetite; loss of interest in
activities; fatigue; feeling
hopeless, worthless or
unreasonably guilty; difficul-
ty concentrating, thinking
clearly or decision-making
and recurring thoughts of
death or suicide.

O’Donnell said that if four
or more of these symptoms
persist for more than two
weeks, that person should
call \X/PIC’s scheduling office
at 624-1001.

Another goal of the proposed
centerwould be interaction
with surrounding African-

the Hill District, Wilkinsburg

There would be a mentoring
process within communities and

within Pitt. The mentoring sys-

tem would include a “tracking
system” to identify and help
solve student problems, Davis
said. _

with people in the [African-

Among the archives at the
center would be “a collection
centered around a prominent
African-American graduate.”
Citing former Pennsylvania state
legislator K. Leroy Irvis as_an

example, Davis said, “There are

no buildings at Pitt named after
him. He was the first African
American to- graduate from the
law school.”

The presentation included
results of a survey BAS sent to
universities across the nation.
Sixteen of 31 schools had sepa-
ratejculture centers, which
served some or all of the follow-
ing groups: African Americans,
Latinos/I-Iispanics, Asians and
American Indians.

The majority responded that
minority retention rates were
“significantly improved” or
“somewhat improved.” ‘When
asked about concrete numbers,
Davis said there was documen-
tation but would not give any
specifics.

A location for the proposed .

center is still undecided.

Davis said.

As for a physical model, Davis
said “something like the Frick

envision.” ‘

“In the long iun, the universi-
ty has provided verbal and writ-

for the university ‘to ‘fund the

although that would be great [if

give an estimate of the cost.

‘ Discrimination. Racism. _Homophobia. A'n_ti-_Semetis’m_.i  "
Recently we’ve been hearing these words, and- oth'ers,f' . 

to. describe relations between people.

Not only here at the University of Pittsburgh but in the
national and international media as well.

The question of whether there will ever come a time
when such vocabulary will cease to be used, because
intolerance ha-s ceased, has been on our minds and
surely on the minds of many others.

It seems that the government of the United States and
its decision-makers are becoming increasingly aware of
what’s going on and are currently looking for solutions
.to_rid us of these energy-wasting activities.

The presence of popular activism and social aware-
ness is directly responsible forthis.

For example, discrimination against gays in the mili-
tary has been a highly—salient issue in our country over
the last year or so, and had become a volatile question
of public policy in the 1992 presidentialcampaign. I

A few months ago President Clinton releasedhis plan
finallyncalling for the‘lifting of the ban against gays who
wanted to serve their country honorably in the military
but could not do so before.

We think. that this was a big and important step.

Likewise, a Seattle, Wash., judge ruled earlier this
week that a gay couple, seeking custody of a 3-year-old
child, could not be kept away from the boy by a

restraining order that prohibited the same—sex couple A

from coming in contact with him.

The door for adoption by gay couples hasbeen‘

opened. A door that a few years

-ago ‘would have been

and cultural acceptance, not only here at Pitt but
nationwide, is in its current state.

Relations between black students and the rest of the
university community are by no ‘means what they

I should be.

describe as intolerance in light of recent acts of vio-
lence against tourists in Florida. AniAfr_ican American

Plight of U.S. Women deplorable

I know what you’re thinking.

As a man, I'm not perfect; and as a human
being, I'm a man. If you don’t understand what I
just said, then read it again until you do. If that
doesn’t work, then move along to another colﬁ
umn because you won’t understand the material
contained inside this one.

You see, I wrote a column for the orientation
issue of The Pitt News about the University of
Pittsburgh and life. If you didn’t read it, read it. I
received a personal letter shortly tl1ereafter,fr_om
someone who__ had read the column and hadbeen
affected by it. The letter found its‘ way into my hot
little hands at just the right time on just the right
day to confirm some feelings I’_d been experienc-
ing concerning both my writing and my life. One

ly tell myself to make myself feel better.), and I’m N

prone to just putter along in my simple existence
and forget about the problems in this country.
Well, I was recently reminded of _what women
have to endure on a daily basis. Some people,
thank God not all of them, are jerks who are

capable of just about anything on the path to get-

ting what they want.

amount of respect and dignity as
any of us who happened, by sheer chance, to
have been born with doodles dangling between
our legs. You know, the things that are often con-
fused with our brains.”

The letter implied that perhaps my phrasing of
that item was not chosen carefully enough. After
all, if you’re not diligent enough, you’re bound to
offend someone. In my haste to produce that col-
umn and get my feelings out on paper, I may
have made that statement sound slightly degrad-

that way, then I apologize sincerely and whole-

nothing was further from my intention.

The Duquesne women's ten-
nis team paid a visit to the Cost
Center yesterday and left virtu-
ally unscathed, sweeping Pitt in
the singles and doubles compe-
tition. This was Duquesne’s first
victory against Pitt in the last
eight years.

Most of the matches were not
a “contest forthe superior
Duquesne squad — with scores
like 6-0, 6-1 and 6-2 running
consistently through the score-
card. It’s not that the Pitt play-
ers played bad, they were just
overmatched.

“My players played real well.
We just ran up against a really
good team. They had a lot of
talent and a lot of depth. They
were real strong at thejtop,”
Pitt head coach George

//
Chris Palmerio/ The Pitt News

Kristen Siegel and the Panthers fell to the Dukes.

Dieffenbach said.

The lone match that was a
real battle involved Pitt’s No. 1
seed Alison Baker. The match

lasted a grueling hour and 45
minutes, with Baker ﬁnally run-
ning out of gas in the third set
and losing 4-6, 7-6, 6-2.

 

“Alison played a terrific
match, but the other girl just
had a few more shots and had
another dimension in her
game,” Dieffenbach said.

The No. 2 seed sophomore
Marla Zielinski played a tough
match, also. After all her grunts,
groans and aggressive play was
over, she lost a decisively hard-
fought match 6-2, 6-0.

“Marla is a very talented‘ play-
er with a lot of heart. She is a
very emotional player,”
Dieffenbach said.

To a team that is dominated
by sophomores with only two
players with two years of expe-
rience -— junior Tammy Keister
and sole senior Barb McCarthy
— every loss is a learning
experience. ,

hard to win this match. I guar-

Rich Aude lumbered out of
the dugout at about 7:15
p.m., a good 20 minutes
before the Pirates’ final home
stand of the year against the
New York Mets was to begin.
Hat pulled low, pant legs
stretched down and first

left hand, he began to throw
with second baseman Carlos
Garcia just foul of first base.

Aude, noticeably shy, fid-
geted around giving uncom-
fortable glances into the lens
of a nearby photographer.

The game itself wasn’t
important by any means —
the Bucs were 21 games out
of contention in the NL East
and the Mets, .baseball’s
lowliest team, were 40.

But the game wasn’t so

the injury to No. 3 seed

Barb McCarthy. This pushed‘

No. 4 seed Tammy Keister

-ates his promotion to The

Show. He knows that there is
going to beno starting job
guaranteed him when he
comes to spring training in
1994, and he will have to fight
for even a roster spot.

“I can’t say I’m going to be
here, -but it’s a major goal of
mine to make the team out of
spring training,” he said.

There is also the chance that
the Pirates will decide not to
include Aude on their 40-man

roster in 1995 — a decision that

could lead to his departure as a
six-year minor. league free
agent. ‘

.“If things don’t work out you ,

got to go where the money is
and where the opportunity to
play is. If the opportunityto
play isn’t there, I’d move on-.”
But for now, Rich Aude is liv-

ing it up —— a major leaguer on

a major league team. He has, at
22, accomplished what most
high school and legion dream-
ers never will.

“There I am, standing on sec-
ond base in St. Louis next to
Ozzie Smith after my first major
league base hit. I said, ‘How’s it
going,’ and he said, ‘Hey’,
what’s up, kid?’

“Here I am talking to a
[future] Hall Of Famer.

.“That’s when I knew that I
had arrived.”

are brothers and sisters, but
they will not respect us and let
us meet in privacy.” ,

Eybers went on to tell stu-
dents why participation in BAS
is valuable.“The’ public schools
try to get black ‘people-to think
andact like-slaves,” Eybers said.

He said‘ th'efP‘o’titi'c:tl Action

Committee will continue recruit-
ing Pitt African-American stu-
dents for BAS. According to
Eybers, they must be be united
and strong due to the relatively
stnall number of African
Americans at Pitt.“There are
only about 2,000 African
Americans at Pitt,” Eybers said.
“That is less than 7 percent. ‘And

look at the faculty, there are
very few black members.”
Eybers said the PAC is look-
ing for more ways to help
African-American students get
more financial aid.“We’Il do
things like lobby the Pittsburgh

City Council and the Clinton‘

administration,” Eybers said.
“But I want you to know, some-'

one is always available in the
BAS office to respond to your
concerns” ' I
Barge said that African-
American Pitt students should
unite," but students should not
forget that residents in the near-
by Hill District and East Liberty

are part of the African culture .

also. . ,‘f’As we speak, there are

brothers and sisters who can’t
imagine having the chances: we
have,” Barge said. “We must
create ttnity so we can do some-
thing to solve our problems.”

A goal to create more unity is
to acquire a black cultural cen-
ter on campus, which Executive

Assistant Vonai Shumba said
