Oakland
residents
unsure of
Pitt plans

Having a task force for Pitt’s pro-
posed convocation center doesn’t
imply an endorsement of the plan
by Oaklandgresidents.

“At this stage, the key is to get
the convocation center task force
rolling, to get a variety of views
put on the table with pros and
cons. It would be premature for
me to comment [on the convoca-
tion center]. Some sort of position
needs to come out of the task
force,” said Caroline Boyce, execu-
tive director of Oakland Planning
and Development Corporation. I

The OPDC is part of the Oakland
Community Coalition, composed
of community groups that have
often been at odds with Pitt over
expansion plans.

‘‘It is very important to under-
stand that the task force.doesn’t
imply an endorsement of the con-
vocation center,” Boyce said. “It is
sure to be a lively discussion. It is
important for the university to
understand [the views of] resi-
dents.”

The convocation center task
force is one of seven formed by
Oakland 2000, which is a “commu-
nity visioning and planning
process,” Boyce said.

Boyce outlined task force pro-
jects at the Master Space Plan Task

night, attended by about 30 per-

Nursing smdentconvocoztion bigbligbtsstrengtbs of program

By.Randy Knapick
For The Pitt News

With enthusiasm and optimism, Dean
Ellen B. Rudy addressed faculty, students
and alumni yesterday at the 1993 School
of Nursing Convocation in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom.

“Our accomplishments are really
astounding,” said Rudy, speaking of the
school’s recent successes in attracting
high—ca1iber students and research
grants. “We are one of the best schools
of nursing  and should begin to say it.”

Rudy stressed that in the competitive
nursing job market of Pittsburgh, where
seven institutions graduate nursing stu-
dents, the school must “look at what
makes [Pitt nursing graduates] stand out.”

In recent years, the caliber of students

coming into the School of Nursing has
increased. “More qualified students are
applying to nursing,” Rudy said. “Almost
no student is below the 20th percentile
in high school.”

According to Rudy, the average SAT
score of the 118 students in the incoming
1993 class is 1018, up from 981 in 1981.
The greater abilities of the students
allows the school to produce “a more
polished product.”

Rudy said she sees “wonderful”

accomplishments in research at Pitt’s
school._ V I _
- This year 32 faculty members are
involved in research projects, including
23 funded by the National Institute of
Health and nine funded by other
sources.

The school has become a more promi-

nent center for research in recent years,
according to Rudy.

Twenty—four schools are known
nationally as “nursing research intensive
environments.” Of these, Rudy boasts,
“We are ranked ﬁfth  fifth!” A comment
greeted by the audience with applause
and cheers.

Rudy mentioned the recent revamping
of the school’s entire master’s degree
program, which resulted in an
“upheaval” for faculty and students. A
new core of courses was introduced after
several departments within the
school proposed revisions of their own.

The revisions reflect changes in the
nursing profession in recent years and
incorporate newer “advanced practice
skills” into the curriculum.

Rudy also expressed the need for fac-
ulty to keep in touch with newer tech-
niques in nursing as well, though faculty
members are not required to participate
in any continuing education activities.

“Retooling of faculty is an opportunity
but not a mandate,” Rudy said. 9

Rudy said she would also like to attract
more full—time graduate students, though
many opt not to study full—time as it
means, “giving up a well—paying job,
which they can’t afford to do.”

The school’s doctorate program,
according to Rudy, has always been able
to accommodate students’ interests in
doctoral thesis research topics.

She expressed concern, however, that
the program is “growing a bit too fast,”
containing “five or 10 more students than

Professors debate teaching in Nationality Rooms

By Hillary Scott

For The Pitt News

Although most agree the
Cathedral of Learning’s
Nationality Rooms are ‘unique,
they may not be the best envi-
ronment for learning, according
to some professors and stu-
dents.

The restriction on not being
able to move furniture is
what Teaching Fellow Charles
Grove calls a “pedagogical
problem.”

Grove, who teaches Spanish,

. said the best way to teach it is

to move the chairs into a semi-
circle. _

“Vfhen the desks are in rows,
they can’t see or hear each
other,” Grove said

“This causes problems with
teaching especially for ﬁrst- and
second-year students. The
rooms aren’t suitable,” accord-
ing to Grove. A

Rona Kaufman, a student of

Grove’s, agreed.

“The chairs are uncomfort-
able and the room is hot,” she
said. a

The whole class wants
to move upstairs where
the chairs are moved into a cir-
cle.” »

However, others said the
Nationality Rooms are ideal for
teaching. Teaching Assistant
Kristen diGennar_o said she
prefers to teach in Nationality
Rooms.

“They promote nicer and inti-

_ mate teaching conditions,” she

said.

Kristen diGennaro teaches
Italian and said it is not neces-
sary to move the chairs into a
semicircle.

Nationality Rooms Director
E. Maxine Bruhns said all
instructors know about the
restrictions before they begin
teaching. -

school year the provost sends a

memorandum to all faculty and

Sciences, advising them that
there are regulations concern-
ing smoking, drinking, eating,
littering and moving furniture,”
Bruhns said.

“If any of the professors have
a problem with any of the poli-
cies, they can  request a room
change,” Nationality Rooms
program Secretary Elizabeth
Cehlar said.

Not all Nationality Room
instructors agree that they pro-
vide a poor environment in
which to teach.

“The Nationality Rooms are a
nice way of introducing “univer-

sity students to the ethnic,
groups of Pittsburgh,” said

Professor Larry Glasco, who
designed the African Nationality
Room.

Glasco said he enjoys teach-

ing in the African room because
he designed the seats to form a
semicircle.

Pitt student Eileen Denton
had a writing class in the
Scottish room and said the set-
ting was “interesting.“

But Denton also said, “The
chairs can’t turn around, and
that made it hard for discus-
sions.” .

Beatrice Malvisi teaches
Italian in the Hungarian room
and said the “best thing would
be just to have the seats in a cir-
cle, but you just can’t do that in
a lot of the rooms.”

The chairs are too close in
the classrooms, according to
Malvisi.

“Language teachers need
to see their students’ mouths
moving, and you can’t if
you can’t walk around,” she
said.

Pitt students bead to England to study tlaeozterfor credit

Byjack Finn

Asst. News Editor

An upclose and personal view of
medieval cathedrals and a chance to
study “the bard” in his hometown is
being offered to select Pitt students for
spring semester.

Under the auspices of Pitt’s Study
Abroad Office, 25 students will live and
learn in merry old England. _

Richard Tobias, from the English
department, and Millard F. Hearn, direc-
tor of architectural studies, will accompa-
ny the students to London where the
professors will teach two classes each.

“We hope to attend four
Shakespearean plays and discuss them in
depth,” Tobias said. “Which plays are
available will dictate what we study, and

for life.

that isn’t known yet, so it’s a little extra
pressure on me.” .

Heam will teach an upper-level course
under his World Cities program. “We will
basically cover the period from Roman
occupation to the present,” Hearn said.
“We can see how a city and its infrastruc-
ture develop.”

Hearn’s second course will provide a
concentrated view of medieval architec-
ture. Students will tour three cathedrals
in London and six more in the surround-
ing area.

The students will be accepted on a first
come, first serve basis, and availability is
limited, according to Tobias.

Informational meetings on the program
will be held Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week. More informa—
tion can be obtained from Annagene

Yucas at the Study Abroad Office on the
fourth ﬂoor of Forbes Quad.

“The student will pay for tuition, room
and board at Pitt but get to study in
England for the same cost,” Tobias said.
Transportation costs to and from
England will be extra, according to
Tobias, but Pitt is searching for the best
group-rate available.

Tobias plans to teach one course on
Shakespeare and one course on the
comic idea from the British perspective.
A visit to the Globe Theater is included. ‘

The classes would require general
writing as a prerequisite, so generally
they will be restricted to upperclass stu-
dents, according to Tobias.

Students will be lodged in bed and
breakfasts near London University and
receive university privileges such as

access to the student union, cafeteria and
athletic facilities. They will also have
monthly Britrail passes, giving the stu-
dents an opportunity to investigate
England on their own.

“Harrod’s [department store] is only a
short distance from where we will be
staying, so shopping can be on the agen-
da, too,” Tobias said.

On days when no classes are sched-
uled, Hearn will give tours of various
museums and other points of interest to
those who are interested, he said.

“We will also encourage students to
investigate on their own, perhaps attend-
ing plays of their choosing,” Heam said.

And, of course, the British custom of
pub lunches and afternoon tea and
crumpets will be part of the experience.

Women's f
Studies for
both men

and women
By Stephanie Alarcon

For The Pitt News

Pitt’s women’s studies pro-
gram offers a course of study
that can be helpful and thought-
provoking to both men and
women, according to students
and administrators involved in
the program.

The document outlining the
program’s certificate require-
ments describes it as a “multi—
disciplinary program committed
to feminist philosophy that
advocates the social, political
and economic equality of the
sexes.”

The program offers under-
graduate and graduate classes
and a women’s studies certifi-
cate, said new director
Professor Irene Frieze.

First-year student Amy Pitkus
said she enjoys the academic
challenges and opportunities for
open discussion in her wo1nen’s
studies literature course.

The composition class con-
centrates on various female
writers such as Gloria Steinem
and Virginia Wolfe.

According to Pitkus, the
issues raised in the literature
inspire fiery group discus-
sions.

“The fight for equality will
continue forever because every-
one is so angry anymore. It’s
almost impossible to talk peace-
fully,” she said.

It is interdisciplinary in scope
and gives students the opportu-
nity to focus on these courses
to form a self—designed major
or a women’s studies
“minor.”

In addition to these spe-
cialized courses of study, the
department sponsors many lec-
tures.

The program, which deals
with “gender issues” that affect
all members of society, wel-
comes both women and men.
Any students with an interest
in women’s roles in the world
are encouraged to take the
courses.

According to Frieze, the acad-

Attitude determines success, associate A.D.

By Amy Fink
For The Pitt News

As far back as Carol Sprague can remember,
her desire has always been to be involved with
sports. Competing, coaching and teaching physi-
cal education has now taken her to an adminis-
tration position.

As Senior Associate Director of Pitt athletics,
Sprague said she is ﬁrm in her belief that one’s
attitude determines success.

“You get out of something what you put into it.
Learn that attitude is everything, and if you work
hard, things will happen,” Sprague said.

Spraguesaid one can learn a great deal from
athletic experiences, such as workingltogether,
punctuality and discipline, and that she works
hard everyday to make sure the opportunities are
the best that she can provide at the University of
Pittsburgh .

In charge of nine athletic teams, Sprague is
responsible for operating the budget, helping to

' recruit and planning each team’s year.

Sprague said she wants the students to be glad
that they attended Pitt, and that they were a part
of the team they played with. V

Sprague said she and the other coaches work
together to provide an experience forjthe stu-
dents. 1

“Students are going to make lifetime‘friend-
ships from their college experiences, and some
of these friendships are going to be with team-
mates or classmates,” she said.

People never forget what they experienced as
a team or the relationships that they made from
the team, according to Sprague. r

Sprague says she’s heard comments about the
fact that she is in charge of only women’s sports.
However, she is in charge of all athletic teams
except for football.

According to Sprague, “It is sports if we pro-
vide the opportunity. Soccer is as important to
our men soccer players and his parents and
friends, as football is to a football player.

"T 0 me it is one, to make sure there is a vehicle

there for the sport, and two, that there is a _

menu," Sprague said.

"The thing that keeps you going is trying to
make something better than what you had it,”
according to Sprague

Because of sports, Sprague said her life is
much different.

Her experiences are never-ending because of

all the traveling she did, the people she met and
the friendships she made. E

Sprague says, “I just really believe in the con-
cept that it is a valuable part vof._your educational
process forthose students that aspire to it. There
are far more success stories than people could
imagine.”

A particular athletic experience that Sprague
said she remembers well occurred when she was
16, and this experience has sparked relationships
that have carried through her life. ’

When girls from two rival schools planned to
meet for tryouts for a softball league, it was pour-
ing down rain.

Only four girls had shown up. Sprague says, “I
knew these girls really wanted to play ball, and
there we were practicing in the heavy rain and
mud, and these are the same girls that are my
best friends today.” .

Not only is Sprague involved within the univer-
sity community, but when she is not coordinating
team schedules for students, she is involved in
personal athletics as well.

Although she enjoys water-skiing, she can usu-
ally be found relaxing and socializing on the golf
course.

Sprague said that she enjoys playing golf with
her friends because it gives them a chance to be
competitive again.

She said she also feels that it is a lifetime sport
that you can either enjoy by yourself or with oth-
ers. _ _

Sprague said she sees just about everything in
her life as a challenge. Drawing back on her
belief attitude determines success, Sprague said
‘she tries to be the best she can be for herself and
for the athletic community she works in.

But Sprague said the drawback to her adminis-
trative position is that it has taken her away from
the competition on the field, which she misses a
great deal. 1'

Future plans for Sprague are possibly to coach
any youth sport, along with one day conquering
the position for athletic director here at the univ-
er—sity. -

“There are more opportunities opening for
women, and I think it can be done,” Sprague
said.

But whatever the future may hold for Carol
Sprague, it will have something to do with sports
and youths.

“I may even want to become a high school ath-
letic director, I love kids,” she said.

emic department in the women’s studies department has

been very successful.

The leadership of the department recently shifted from Dr.
Susan Hansen, whose term expired last January, to Frieze,
who is no stranger to the program.

She helped start the program after the idea had been con-
ceived, developed and funded.

The first director of the program was Mary Briscoe, who is
now the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

When asked about the equal rights and feminist-oriented
activity in the Pittsburgh area, Frieze said she feels that
Pittsburgh is a fairly-conservative city, partly because of the
inﬂuence of the Catholic population.

According to Frieze, women make up a relatively small
percentage of thevwork force, but fortunately that number
seems to be rising. Manufacturing businesses are not very
receptive, but more positions in directing and management
are opening up.

Graduate student Mary Yanok, who completed the certifi-
cate program in women’s studies, said she first became inter-
ested in the program when she took a general writing course
which focused on the subject. ' ’

The more classes she took in the program, the more
involved she became. ~

“I really like the quality teachers [and] the variety of classes
I was able to take,” Yanok said. “I enjoyed it because it
appealed to me.” '

“There are many funders of
Oakland 2000: foundations, the

university has committed some
of the seed money, $3,000, to

“We’re hoping to raise

"To make things better for

In the question and answer

‘asked about recycling, the

Ott said she plans to have a

of recycling for all residence

containing “five or 10 more students than
it can easily handle.”

In the future, Rudy said the school will
have to “pull the cream of the crop,” pre-
venting further overinﬂation of the pro-
gram.

One of Rudy’s personal goals is to
establish a “nursing management clinic,”
which would provide a place for stu-
dents, faculty and researchers to conduct
their work.

Since the school cannot pay the over-
‘head costs to build a new clinic, Rudy
suggests the school initiates a “shared
existence with another clinic.”

The two-year renovation work on the
Victoria Building nears completion with
the only remainingwork on the building’s
fourth ﬂoor. '

Because of the difficulty visitors have
finding the Victoria Building which is

mingled in among the entrances to
Children's Hospital, Rudy said a blue
awning will soon be installed with
“University of Pittsburgh School of
Nursing” printed in white letters.

“I always told visitors to walk up the
street until they saw the lhospital’sl
awning.

"I thought we should have something
like that,” Rudy said.

Since it protrudes over a city right of
way, special permission was needed to
install an awning.

The awning will be paid for by Ellen
Shaffee, a retired School of Nursing facul-
ty member.

Rudy also suggested the Learning

‘Research Center needs renovation, since
9 the LRC “is where information science is

going‘)? .
In the future, Rudy said the School must
teach its students “how to handle the sys-

tem they’ll be working in,” and also
insure the nursing profession adapts to
pending health-care reforms.

In other business, Judith T. Matthews,
president of the Doctoral Student Nursing
Organization, spoke of her organizations
first nursing forum, which allows the
school’s 70 doctoral nursing students to
voice their concerns in a “down to earth
exchange.”

The forums also feature distinguished
speakers, and occur on the second
Monday of the month in 569 Victoria
Building from noon until 1 p.111.

Pageant outdated

Yes, it’s that time of year again. The time when 51
young women get the privilege of squeezing their per-
fectly-proportioned bodies into evening gowns and
swimsuits under the auspices of scholarship.

These young women, all born with a beautiful, will
receive the “honor” of having hundreds of men stare
and ogle at them through televisions during that one

, night in September. The infamous event will takes place

in Atlantic City. After hours of patriotic songs and intro-
ductions of the prestigious judges, the spectacle of five-
foot-eight-inch women who weigh 115 pounds is ﬁnally
witnessed.

Yes, there she is, Miss America, representing the patri-
archal view our “modern” society holds of women.
Women have fought to prove that they deserve and
have the right to be judged on more than their legs, but-
tocks and breasts, but obviously this message hasn’t
gotten to the public who continues to tune in.

Once again, we are subject to this outdated event that

. teaches little girls to strive for beauty and give a charm-

ing answer to an impromptu question about poverty.
Symbolizing modern—American culture, the Miss
America Pageant undermines the efforts of women in
our country. '

The American pageant circuit that starts with junior
misses all over the country encourages young women
to constantly think of their appearances and how judges
will rate them. No one can honestly say this leads to a
healthy self-esteem.

According to The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, “[a] new
Hollywood producer,a relaxed dress code, the elimina-
tion of professional hairdressers and makeup artists and

V the requirement that contestants choose issues to‘ pro-
‘ mote throughout their reign are all intended to. update

the aging competition.”
These changes sound more like an appeasement

. rather than an update. As long as the contest exists at

all, young girls will learn that they are being looked at
and judged, not as people, but as lengths of eyelashes
and perkiness of breasts. ’

The pageant has made rating women on their appear-
ance and poise a national tradition. This puts funda-
mental rights such as equal,pay and equal treatment at
the risk of never being taken seriously.

In another attempt to .“update” the event, this year the

Miss America Pageant has added a 1-900 number for

viewers to call and vote for or against the swimsuit

pageant. Abolishing this portion of the competition is

' not enough because the women are looked at as

objects regardless of what they are or what they are not
wearing. Teaching girls and boys that a_ female is an
object of scrutiny leads to not only low self—esteem and
persistent sexism, it also contributes to dangerous prob-
lems so prevalent in our society ranging from eating dis-
orders to rape.

All not feminists

Chancellor O’Connor’s
promise of “change” at the
Lantern Night ceremony,
Tuesday, Aug.1, prompted
the Sept. 1, editorial advocat-
ing the expansion of the
women’s studies program cer-
tificate to a full-fledged
“women’s study major,”
where “woman’s issues”
could be studied “from a
woman’s perspective.” In

A keeping with another article

in the Sept. 1, paper which
points out that the light of the
lantern represents “truth,” I
suggest that what The Pitt
News actually has in mind is a
“feminist study major,” which
would study “feminist issues”
from a “feminist” perspec-
tive.” .

Not all women are femi-
nists. To the contrary, polls
I’ve seen usually suggest most

0 women shun the feminist

label. The largest women’s
national political organization
is not the feminist National
Organization for Women,
membership, 250,000 but the
conservative Concerned
Women for America, mem-
bership 600,000 (source: 1992
National Encyclopedia of
Associations).

Feminism is a specific polit-
ical and social philosophy. To
equate this philosophy with
half of the human race based
on gender is not only dishon-
est, but itself has a whiff of
sexism about it. Doesn’t the
statement that there is an
identifiable “woman’s per-
spective” seem rather sexist?

Doesn’t it suggest that gender.

governs reasoning, a notion
that feminists have justly

fought hard against?

Women’s perspectives and
opinions of political and
social issues are widely
diverse. Yet, judging from
similar programs in other uni-
versities and the women’s
studies program already in
place at Pitt, I doubt that the
proposed major would pro-
vide equal access to the view-
points of women who oppose
feminism.

It is clear to me that these
programs are not dedicated to
the study of women, but
rather, to the promotion of
feminism.

No to Brady

This is a response to Ross
Pasquale’s article, “Guns too
easily reach adolescents.”

Ross Pasquale’s research for
his article on gun control was
inadequate. Had he read the
Brady bill, he would’ve dis-
covered that it’s nothing more
than a waiting period bill.
Even Sarah Brady admitted it
wouldn’t have prevented her
husband’s tragedy. The NRA
opposes the Brady ‘bill
because: 1) It doesn’t do any-
thing to control criminal use
of handguns, and 2) the
Brady bill prevents law-abid-
ing citizens from purchasing a
handgun quickly. What in the
world does this have to do
with stemming hcmdgzm vio-
lence? And the waiting period
is unnecessary because an
NCIC computerized back-
ground check already exists
to do the check in seconds!

The Brady bill would actu-

ally cost lives because it
deprives eligible citizens from
purchasing a handgun readily
after being threatened. I am
convinced it is a totally use-
less bill. Its true goal is to
begin eroding away at our
Second Ammendment rights
and eventually ban all guns
outright.

Indeed, that’s the stated
goal of Handgun Control
Incorporated (HCI), led by
Sarah Brady. Let’s stop wast-
ing time with stupid bills and
start addressing the real prob-
lems, like our corrupt criminal
justice system, weakened
economy and decaying family
and social structures.

News is covered

With reference to the
remarks of Oscar Eybers,
Political Action Committee
chair of the Black Action
Society, I am at a loss why
anyone would want to have a
dialogue with a bigot.

Day after day, week after
week, month after month last
term there was NO group that
received more ink in The Pitt
News than blacks. The record
speaks for itself, another rea-
son for no dialogue with

-someone of Eybers’ ilk.

As a matter of fact, there
was so much ink for blacks, it
was all out of proportion for
their numbers on campus,
and I wondered if the editor
of The Pitt News last time was
black.

Elizabeth Majors knows
football.

The wife of the late leg-
endary Coach Shirley Majors
and mother of five gridiron
sons, she had no choice but
to understand the pigskin
game.

So what she told her son
after an embarrassing coach-
ing loss a few years ago was
no surprise. It was the hard-
core truth.

“My mom put her arm
around me,” Majors said yes-
terday at Pitt’s weekly press
conference, “and said, ‘Don’t
«worry about it, if you stay
around long enough there
will be others.”

Well Johnny Majors is still
around, and the prophetic
Momma Majors must have
had Virginia Tech on her
mind.

Fielding questions about
the 63-21 loss to the Hokies
this past weekend, Majors is
taking his mother’s advice
and not making excuses.

On the contrary, the

mitted to working harder and

talking straight. _

“It was an embarrassin
loss, but I’m going to keep.on
going,” Majors said. “I’m not
going to walk around with
my head down.

“I don’t want people to feel
‘sorry for me or this team,”
Majors added. “And I don’t
want to feel sorry for myself.”

After the thorough beating
by Virginia Tech, Majors did

not want to beat his team
down either.

“You don’t brow beat any-

T here’s a new sports book hitting the
stores this week, a local non—fiction
compilation about a team that -— for all
intents and purposes — was a dream
come true.

“Maz and the .‘6O Bucs,” written by
Pittsburgh author Jim O’Brien, details
the memories that flow from that won-
drous team — a team that defied the
odds to defeat Mickey Mantle, ‘Whitey

Mozzeros/ei dinger bits bomefor second

years. He learned baseball from his
father and, along with his younger
brother, played the game throughout
high school.

An obvious Pirate fan, my dad’s early
favorites included shortstop Dick _Groat
and, of course, Roberto Clemente. He
spent many a summer’s evening sitting
in the rightfieldlbleachers watching the
Pirates battle the Musials and Drysdales

Ford and the New York
Yankees to win the 1960
World Championship. I

possible — winning the

were blown out of the Sugar
Bowl and the national champi-
onship by Alabama. Then they

lost 15 starters.
They’re opening at the top of

Big East football in their first -

year of conference play, with
Syracuse and Boston College
being_ other top prospects. But
the ‘Canes always seem to
come out on top in these situa-
tions. K

1. Miami

1992 Record: 11-1 overall, 4-
O in the Big East.

Top Returners: Senior

‘defensive ends David Krein (an

All-American candidate, eight

‘sacks -last year) and Kevin

Patrick (All-Big East selection
with eight sacks in 1992); free

-safety Terry Harris (a Playboy.

Preseason All-American); junior
fullback Donnell Bennett (437
yards and six touchdowns rush-
ing in ‘92) and junior guard

_Tirrell Greene (only returning

starter up front).

Coach's Comments:
“Everybody is waiting to see
this program fall. I guess that’s
human nature. My motivation is
not to let that happen,” head
coach Dennis Erickson said.

“The pride the players have in .
this program and the pride of '

the‘ coaches is motivation

another national champi-

ence?

.Frank Costa steps into the
Miami quarterback machine.
Just when the ‘Canes seem to

Maybe that’s where we are, but
we still have to go out there

Outlook: The magic number
for this team is 29. When the
Orange. score 29 or more
points, they are undefeated —
228-0 over their 104-year histo-
ry.
The biggest problem for this
team is defense. With the line-
backer core made up _of first-
and second—year players, some-
one will h-ave to step up for

‘this team to be on top in the

conference.

3. Boston College

1992 Record: 8-3-1 overall,
2-1-1 in the Big East.

Top Returners: Senior quar-
terback Glenn Foley (55 per-
cent completions, 2231 yards,
15 TDs and 12 INTs); fullback
Dwight Shirley (604 yards and
eight touchdowns); tight end
Pete Mitchell (40 receptions for
555 yards. and three touch-
downs) and linebacker Stephen
Boyd (153 tackles and five
sacks in ‘92).

Coach’s Comments: .“Our
expectations are very high for
lFoleyl,” head coach Tom
Coughlin said.

“He’s a four—year starter who
has continued to develop as a
leader. Glenn has matured in
the responsibility of the quar-
terback position and has placed
team success above individual
success.”

“I am concerned that our big
play people still have to
emerge.”

Outlook: The Eagles will
have plenty of big plays on
offense, thanks to Foley.
Chuckie Dukes is gone, taking
his school record 1,587 yards in
‘92 with him, but Shirley leads
a ‘solid group of backs.

The problems will come on
defense, which was nothing
special ‘last year before losing

three All-Big East selections.

The Eagles could get comfy
staying in third place in the

inaugual Big East round-robin

season, and playing in another
lesser bowl this year.

‘ For the Pitt defense, what a
difference nine days makes.

Two weeks ago this
Thursday, the Panther “D” was
stuffing the Southern

Mississippi offense to the tune
of 10 points — none in the
decisive second l1a1f.

Last Saturday, the Panthers
crumbled in record-setting fash-
ion by giving up 63 points ‘to
Virginia Tech before a home

. opener crowd of 53,839 fans at

Pitt Stadium.

From relentless winners  to

undermanned, overmatched

" losers.

How did it happen? Take
your pick. ‘

Lack of execution.

Hot opponent.

Alignment of the‘sun and
moon.

One Panther prefers the first
of the three.

“We didn’t execute,” Pitt
defensive tackle Tom Barndt

‘said. “If we would execute

what we’re told to do, we
wouldn’t allow penetration.”
The Panthers set several new
lows in their ‘93 home opener
loss-, including the worst open-
ing loss ever (42 points), break-
ing a mark set by the 1945 Pitt
squad. versus Notre Dame (41-

0). Theyualso broke the total

yards by an opponent mark
(675), as well as yards rushing
by an opponent (500).

“We were beaten every way
we could have been beaten,”

. Pitt head coach Johnny Majors

said. ‘‘We couldn’t have been
beat any worse.”

A Beyond strategy and execu-
tion — or lack thereof — a big
reason why Pitt was beaten so

badly was because it was beat- I

en. Physically beaten.

' Among the_ injured Saturday
night: linebackers Gerald
Simpson (knee) and Tom
Tumulty (elbow),. defensive
ends Zatiti Moody (knee) and
Dell Seagraves (knee) and full-

_. back Vince Williams.

Linebacker Gerald Simpson may be out for the season with a  injury.

The loss of Pitt’s top two
tacklers — outside backers

lem, as the Panthers were

forced to use inexperienced,

unproven rookies for most of
the second half. I
Virginia Tech exploited Pitt’s
depleted run defense for five
TDs and 500 yards.
“It shows you what kind of

esfrom l/irginia

Matt -Serlin/The Pitt News

situation we’re in right now,”
Majors said. “We don’t have the
depth to lose people.”

So what will Pitt do to
improve against, of all teams,
the running-dominant Ohio

  T ec/9 nightmare

State Buckeyes?

Get back to basics.

“We have to try and make
things happen on the field 
be more efficient, stress funda-
mentals,” Majors said.

“Other than correct our mis-
takes and learn for the next
game, there’s not much more
to say about Virginia Tech,”
Barndt said.

Well put. _

PITT ‘NOTES: Tumulty,
Moody and Seagraves are ques-
tionable for Saturday’s Ohio
State game. Simpson is out

indefinitely and may be red- ‘

shiited.
Sophomore Anthony Dorsett
has been converted to wide

receiver for two reasons,

according to Majors.
“First, he had not made 
progress at defensive back.

[Second], (but of necessity — '

we needed the competition at
wide receiver,” Majors said.
Dorsett was switched to
wideout after redshirt freshmen
Curtis Anderson injured his
shoulder in practice last week.

is a loss.

“You can lose by one point
or one second,” Majors said.
“And those one-point losses are
emotionally draining, too.

“Your emotions are 180
degrees different anytime you
win or lose,” Majors added.

With the swing of the pendu-
lum going south for the
Panthers, what will it take this
week at practice to gear up for
perennial -power Ohio State
University?

“We’ll try to make things bet-
ter with our work habits,”
Majors said.

“We’ll need solid coaching

and the team will have to
respond to it.” .

How the players respond and
react after the Virginia Tech
game is another question. One
Majors can’t answer.

“It will be difficult to see how
players will react,” Majors said.
“It’s even tough to ‘tell with tal-
ented teams.

“Teams are made up of so
many individuals, and I can’t
predict [how the team will han-
dle the lossl,” Majors added.

Majors is sure, however, that
there will be competition at the

week in practice.

through 1967. He would
then move to Ohio with
his wife and only child
— a job with Firestone to
be done. But he would
never see anything as
grand in the sports world
as that magical homer.
(He was also at Franco’s
“Immaculate Reception,”
but that runs a distant

He didn’t need to. He’d

I moved to Pittsburgh
in 1989 after two fun—but-
unproductive years at
Ohio State. Since I've
been at Pitt, I’ve con-
stantly yearned to create

4. Rutgers

1992 Record: 7-4 overall, 4-2
in the Big East.

Top Returners: Senior quar-
terback Bryan Fortay (115-230
for 1,608 yards and 16 TDs);
sophomore running back Bruce
Presley, _(1992’s Big East Rookie
of the Year, 148 rushes for 817
yards); Free Safety Jay Bellamy
(a second team All-Big East
pick, led team with four inter-
ceptions).

Outlook: Four wins isn’t that
much of a mirage. But along
with the other second division
Big East teams, they won’t beat
any of the best — BC, Miami or
the ‘Cuse. They could surprise
the Mountaineers at West
Virginia, but probably won’t get
by Penn State on Saturday at
Beaver Stadium.

5. West Virginia

1992 Record: 5-4-2 overall,
2-3-1 in the Big East.

Top Returners: QB's Darren
Studstill (56 percent, 1065
yards, nine TDs) and Jake
Kelchner (55 percent, 901 yards
and six T Ds); wide receiver Ed
Hill (43 receptions, 540 yards,
six TDs); All-Big East punter
Todd Sauerbrun; linebacker
Tim Brown (119 tackles) and
senior safety Mike Collins (All-

_Big East with 78 tackles and

three interceptions).

Coach’s Comments: “We’ve
got more players returning with
experience, and we’ve ’ got
more experience at quarterback
than a year ago, so that has to
make us more optimistic,” head
coach Don Nehlen said.

may be some improvement, but
not enough to move into the

7. Virginia Tech

1992 Record: 2-8-1, 1-4 in
the Big East.

Top Returners: Senior quar-
terback Maurice DeShazo (101-
215, 1,504 and 12 TDS); split-
end Antonio Freeman (32
catches for 703 yards, 22.0
yards per catch); center Jim
Pyne (not allowed a sack in his
college career) and All-
American candidate cornerback
Tyronne Drakeford.

Coach's Comments: “There
is no question that we have
some quality players,” head
coach Frank Beamer said. “We
will, however, have young,

inexperienced players at a
number of positions and only
time will tell how they react.”

Outlook: With Pyne,
DeShazo and Freeman, the
Hokies won’t be short on
points. It remains to be seen,
however, if they will be able to
stop such high-powered offens-
es as Miami, BC and Syracuse.
Seven wins is not out of the
question, -but it will be very
tough to beat heads offensively

best in the nation. ‘

Coach's Comments:
“Temple football is a sleeping
giant,” head. coach Ron
Dickerson said. “The future of
this program is endless. There
are enough good players in
and around Philadelphia to get
excited about.

Outlook: The situation at
Temple is similar to the one at
Pitt, but worse. Coach
Dickerson seems to be the man
to turn this program around,
but not this season. The talent
pool is limited, and young
players will have to play big
roles.

Five wins will be considered
a success for this team.
