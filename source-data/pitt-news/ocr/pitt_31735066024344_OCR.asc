‘Pitt trustees talk about tuition hikes, economic alter-

Dr. Lloyd Bond ofthe University of Pittsburgh has been named for
a position on a committee of psychologists to monitor and improve
methods of testing the mental capabilities of mililtary recruits.

Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger announced the creation of
the committee on June 30, as the result of flaws in the present testing
system which had resulted in underestimating the percentage oflower-
mentality recruits accepted by the military services.

Weinberger said that seven psychologists from universities, indus-
tries and testing corporations had been asked to serve voluntarily on a
Defense Advisory Committee on Military Personnel Testing. They
were chosen, the Pentagon said, “because of their wide ranging
expertise."

Pitt Scientists Measure

. T oxicity

Toxicologists, chemists, ﬁreﬁghters and public officials have long

known of the lethal smoke and fumes released by synthetics during a
fire. Now, through research at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate
School of Public Health, there is a method of classifying smoke
toxicity. It is the result of research conducted by Yves Alarie, profes-
sor and chairman of the Department of Industrial and Environmental

Health at Pitt, and Rosalind Anderson, now of the Arthur D. Little‘

Co., of Cambridge, Ma. _

The classifications are based on experiments in which laboratory
animals received controlled doses of smoke and fumes from wood and
more than two dozen common synthetics. Alarie and Anderson deter-
mined both the concentration and the time necessary for the fumes to
become lethal, and ranked the materials accordingly.‘

Lunar Light Show Friday

There will be a partial eclipse of the moon during the late evening
hours of Thursday, July 16 and the early morning hours of Friday,
July I7 according to Paul J. Oles, Director of Planetarium Programs

j moon, atits full phas_e,‘enters the shadow of the earth. '

The full moon will begin entering the “umbra” or darkcentral

portion of the earth’s.shadow at about H225 "EDT.

Posvar Defends Against Press ;

Explains Problems ae

By LINDA MILLER

Pill News Sloll Writer

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
defended Pitt against the bad press it
has received in‘th'e media lately at
Monday’s Senate Council Meeting.

“We can refute each and every
negative comment made about the
School of Medicine," Posvar said.
“The most important problem con-
fronting the school is not money.”

lnstead, it is the lack ofcommuni-
cation among the science depart-
ments. Posvar said these
departments-need to be “brought
together, have their responsibilities
clarified, and the situation
corrected."

According to Posvar, the initial
verbal report by the visiting accredi-
tation committee listed this organi-
zational problem as the major
concern and recommended either
the amalgamation of the science
departments or the massive con-’
struction of new departments as
solutions. Further, he said that the
three year accreditation by the Lia-
son Committee on Medical Educa-
tion came as a surprise to both Pitt

and the visiting accreditation team. '

When asked why the accredita-
tion report and the proposed solu-
tions were never made public, except
for the leaks from dissident faculty
members, Posvar explained that it
was because; of the ‘nature of the
reports.

“They are couched in private and
terse form," he said. “It isia confi-
dential report, which creates a

dilemma for open discussion.”
Posvar also said that the Liason

It may be funny to describe your

Ihe South Oakland Citizen’s

,/set up to help Oakland tenants avoid

being ripped off by their landlords.

The SOCC handles tenant com-
plaints, and advises them on what
rights they have.

For example, ‘if your landlord
won’t fix that leaky stove or broken
pipe, you can sue for back rent,

S according to SOCC member John

Zingaro.
Tenants who decide to sue a land-
lord can actually afford it. The

a FY 82 budget proposal that
included an aveage tuition hike of 12
percent, no one was surprised. Most
people in the university community
have come to view decisions made
by the Board as rubber stamp appro-
vals of university policy proposals.
Yet, according to Board secretary
Dr. John Quatroache, the Board

does, in fact, spend considerable‘

time debating policy issues. It is just
that most discussions occur in com-
mittees. ,

"Committees make recommenda-
tions to the Board," Quatroache
said, "and they are usually accepted
because most of the problems have
been worked out beforehand in
committee. " '

The Pitt News sought Trustee
opinions on the issues surrounding

Pitt's financial condition and rela-

tions with the state, which, it is often
said. are the primary causes of tui-
tion hikes. ' '

The interviews that follow,

including a conversation with Alfred V

E. Lawson, the only trustee to vote

A against the FY82 budget, represent

a wide cross-section of views.

Robert Kirby is the newly-elected .

chairman of the Board, and also
chairman of the board of Westing-
house Corp.

Eugene F. Scanlon, former
majority whip of the Pennsylvania

Senate, is a Commonwealth Trustee L

appointed by the President Pro-tem
of the Senate. ~

monwealth Trustee, but from the
Governor's office, is currently the
commissioner of the Federal Mine

 Pitt‘ News: -

  

Kirby: The legislature is really the ;

main problem. Previous administra-
tions have "poured large sums into
the school system, but not into the
state-related universities. We were
able to get a slightly higher amount
fromithe state this year, but we are
still woefully below the rate of
inﬂation.

Now we are faced with the
dilemma of having held down salary
increases of the teaching staff for
several years, and then trying to
make it upjust to protectthe univer-
sity. "So, we decided that an average
of at. least l0 percent was what we
could give. Consequently, we had to
raise tuition rates.

Kirby: What are the problems"

with state support that it is consist-
ently so far below Pitt’s needs?
Kirby: The state's percentages of
our costs have been dropping dram-
atically for over ten years. On top of
this, the state of Pennsylvania has
some serious problems financially.

- But one of the biggest problems with .

the legislature is that they can’t do
any effective planning. ‘ .
You take the average legislator;
the next election is the furthest he
can plan. It is one of the difficulties
of our current form ofgovernmenti

When you stop ‘and think about it,’

there is nobody that has the respon-

sibility to plan more than six years,‘-
as in the case of a U.S. senator. -

There is a very good reason for this,

of course; bringing a problem up to I

the voters is a negativ_e__,thought.
Therefore, if it isn't going to happen
until after the election, there is no
one who is going to bring up the

problem. A corporation couldn’t ‘b

~ Pitt News: What is your feeling
about Mr. Lawson’s lone vote

, against tuition increases proposed in

the new budget?

Kirby: There are always those
who vote against tuition increases,
and I think correctly so, because in
their minds, they think, as a state
university, we should tryto keep the
tuition down one way or another.

Pitt News: It seems that regardless
of what happens in the future, Pitt is
faced with a tight financial situation
today. Is the decline in state support
a good thing or a bad thingfor Pitt?

Scanlon: lthink it is a good thing;
it will force the University to stay
within certain limits. It is unfortu-
nate that it has to happen this way,
but I think it’s a good thing.

I am more concerned, really, with
the future of the private institutions
in this state, the Duquesnes and the
CM Us who are really in trouble

gain for Pitt.

I would hate to think what would
happen to the whole concept of
higher ecucation if the Duquesnes
and the CM Us had to close down.

Pitt News: What is your reaction
to Mr. Lawson’s vote against the

budget? .

Scanlon: I think it is phony for
someone on_ the board of trustees to
vote against that tuition increase
without coming up with a viable
alternative. He’s engaging in classic
demagoguery as far as I’m
concerned. .

Pitt News: What do you see as an
alternative to higher tuition rates?

Scanlon: There was a guy named

Pittenger who used to be the old-

Secretary of Educationgand I served
with him in the house.’ He had a
concept called the Graduated Tui-

tion plan. Based on the theory that,

at Pitt, and a lot of our state related
schools, there arein fact many stu-

dents there whose parents could
_have sent them to private. schools.

They are using the publicsector to

educate their kids. His theory is if A.

you can afford to pay the six or

’ ‘seven thousand,a yearyou pay it, if

you can afford nothing, you pay
nothing. I think it was very interest-
ing, and I think that it may be a

_‘ direction that will have to go/in with —
- education. / - i 1

 
 
  

Pitt News: What about the state’s

greater support to the state-run ,- 2

schools, compared with Pitt?
Lawson: Well, I think we’re
entitled to at least equal considera-

tion from the state. I think that the V

research institutions, such as Pitt,
are'entitled to the support. They are
what makes not only a region, but a
state. Lét’s face it, Pitt is maybe the
major resource’ in. Pittsburgh. If
you’re attempting to attract people

. Different
Meanings

People sometimes attach different meanings to
the same word. Britain’s Prime Minister Mar-
garet Thatcher is an excellent example. Her
rationalization for the increasingly violent riots
in England and Scotland is that the whole mess is
simply caused by a common vice———greed.

The word “greed” connotes selfishness and
gluttony. Kings have often been portrayed as
greedy. Nations can be considered greedy when
they hoard above and beyond what they need,
depriving others of their means of survival.

What is occurring in Britain is not the result of
greed. It is an act of frustration at being economi-
cally helpless for so long. This does not justify
senseless violence. But it does not define greed,
either. 1 '

Why then would Mrs. Thatcher, her advisors,
and the English monarchy ignore Br.itain’§,pro‘b-
lems by writing them off as greed? If we accept
Mrs. Thatcher’s explanation, what should we

AA expect from her as a solution? Lectures on the
~. evils of vice, or stories about King Midas? It is no

wonder she was called a “stupid woman” when
she first announced that she had discovered greed
is the root of all evil in England.

To suggest a superficial cause will not make
Britain’s problems go away. Stretching laissez-
faire policies to excessive limits can, and
obviously has, backfired in Britain. Unemploy-
ment and inﬂation are high, which feeds the fires
of the jobless, regardless of color.

What is left to be done is best decided by those

trained in economics and blessed with common

. sense. Before the first step can even be taken,

  

however, there remains the problem of Britain
overcoming its pride and addressing questions
that are literally crying to be answered.
It is easy to draw parallels between Britain’s
situation and the turbulence of America’s l960’s.
‘ While the Kerner Commission was citing unem-
ployment and bad housing as primary causes of
urban rioting, the Johnson Administration was
still trying to salvage the rhetoric of the Great
Society. Riots over joblessness were blamed‘on
racial strife, ignoring the more obvious problem
of black unemployment. Violence, after all, is a
failure to communicate: America’s l960’s finally
exploded in violence, which brought a hard-won
and uneasy truce. ‘

Fighting The Med School increase

In the University community in
Oakland the summer is no longer the
quiet season, the time when students
recess to recharge their batteries,
renew their spirits and enthusiasm
and where faculty members write
lectures and manuscripts; the
summer is now the time when
Deans, Chancellors and members of
the Board of Trustees conspire and
scheme to push the University of
Pittsburgh School of _Medicine
further-and further beyond the reach
and aspiration of the people of
Pennsylvania whose tax dollars sus-
tain the state-related institution.
Their arrogant disregard of the
interests and welfare of the citizens,
to borrow words from Dean Leon,
means that “the children of miners
and steelworkers won’t be able to
afford medical school and the access

to the poor, lower middle class stu- .

dents will continue to be restricted".
The “Captains of Industry” who
dominate the Board of Trusteesjust
approved, by a margin of50 to l, the
largest tuition increase in the\history
of the School of Medicine; Pitt has
now become far and away the most
expensive state-related medical
school in America". In terms of medi-
cal education, Pitt now evokes the
same image that Mississippi and

Attendance

Dear Editor,

Your July I, I98] editorial
entitled “Not Quite Enough” about
the new class attendance policy
regarding eligibility for certain stu-
dents who participate in intercolle-
giate athletics recognizes concerns
which are shared by many. As back-
ground—in_formation, with which you .
may not be familiar, you need to
recognize that at the University of
Pittsburgh, athletic eligibility is
determined only once a year, prior
to the start of the Fall Term, except
for a requirement to be registered for
a minimum of 12 credit hours. In
part, at least, as a consequence of
this, some students, particularly
seniors, after obtaining a year of
eligibility, do not attend very regu-
larly the classes for which they are
registered; Many of these students
get poor grades which limit their

. academic achievement and thus may
compromise their future athletic
eligibility and, ultimately, their
graduation. Most students, the com-
mittee has observed, who are inter-
collegiate athletes and who get poor
grades and have very irregular class
attendance.

Many efforts have been made,
and will continue to be made, by the
Senate Committee on Athletics and
others to help these and other inter-_
collegiate athletes to do better aca-
demically. These include providing
increased amounts of tutoring, more
helpful course registration advice,
and encouraging coaches to take an
active interest in the academic activi-

_ ties of their players.

However. though all of these and
other approaches have improved the
situation they did not eliminate it.
The class attendance policy was con-
sidered for quite some time by this
committee, the University Athletic
Committee, the Senior Vice-
Chancellor for Administration
(representing the Chancellor), the
Provost, the Deans, Athletic Direc-
tor. and all of the coaches. All had
deep concerns about a policy that

 

 minim-um coverage‘ for conventions

Arkansas symbolize in the field of
education in general. Pitt is a medi-
cal school that has escaped theorbit

A of- state control and public accounta-

bility; it has become what Chancel-
lor Posvar told me he has always
viewed it as—a private institution. (I
wonder if Dr. Posvarwould reiterate
ate that perception to legislator ltkin
or lrvis). So here we stand with a
medical school supported by tax
dollars led by imperious administra-
tors who acknowledge that Pitt has
become a resource for the rich and
one that should cater to the special
interests of the benefactors of the
University (the latter is a euphemism
for the “beautiful" people who hold
power and money in the city).

My own view is that the obscene
tuition decision has served one great
purpose; it has drawn a battle line on
the campus that has allowed us to
identify clearly those who control
the gates to the medical school and
who regard the vast majority of the
citizens of Pennsylvania with dis-
dain. Where do we find the forces
who will stand against the imperial

chancellor and the arrogant trustees ’

who sit “above the salt”? There are

.many thoughtful persons from dif-

ferent walks of life who could con-
tribute to this important campaign.

First, there are the medical stu-
dents themselves. They must throw
off the yolk of passivity that has
been laid upon t_hem by the Dean
and Associate Deans of the Medical
School who coop them and neutral-
ize their dissent by throwing them a
bone in the form ofone hundred feet
of sewer pipe cut into mailboxes, a
defunct piano resurrected from the
trash heap and a musty-carpeted 400
square feet “recreation” room that
has the smell and appearance of the
restrooms at a bus station. Dean
Leon has said publicly that he hopes
the recent tuition for freshman will

remain almost the same _throughout__w

their four years of medical school.
He has gone even further by stating
that “our hope is that we can get
away without an increase. We are
trying to get a stabilized tuition pol-
icy for each class so that students
won’t be taken by surprise.”The first
order of business of medical stu-
dents when they return to Oakland
in September should be to demand
Dean Leon to‘“stand and deliver” on
this promise of “no more surprises".
Perhaps the students could place a
plaque on the Dean’s door stating
“Enter without fear of surprises”. In
a related vein, the students must

is loss ofintercollegiate athletic par-
ticipation eligibility—not academic
discipline of any sort. All of the
above agreed that the goals and pur-
poses of this policy far outweigh its
liabilities. Actually, it could be
argued that all eligibility rules other
than a requirement that an intercol-
legiate athlete be a full-time student
are discriminatory.

The University anticipates full
faculty cooperation. Recording
class attendance in not new here. it
has been going on for GI Bill vet-
erans for some years now with min-
imal, if any, problems.

A major hope forthe policy isthat
it will encourage freshmen and
transfer students to develop class

attendance habits that some might

' not havedeveloped otherwise and

thus contribute to better academic
achievement by them. There is,
therefore, the very real possibility
that the policy will be needed for.
only a few years.

This fall it will become one of the
university’s eligibility requirements
and recognized by the NCAA as
such. The university, therefore, will
have no option but to follow it rig-
idly. Hugh Green, in your.hypotheti-
cal situation, definitely would not be‘
in the game and probably not even
on the sidelines.

Inadequate]
Dear Editor,_ J

_ Mark Collins’ column, “Plati-
tudes and Empty Promises for Dis-
abled (The Pitt News, July 8, I-981) is
not only misleading but inade-
quately researched. His thesis, pre-
sumably, is that days, weeks or years
of recognition for any cause are
merely. empty, meaningless
acknowledgements to the persons or
groups being honored. Whether or
not this is true is a matter of opinion.
But his information regarding the
International Year of Disabled Per-
sons is woefully understated.

First, the lnternational Year of

Disabled Persons (IYDP) has given

handicapped persons like myself the
first real opportunity we've ever had

to have ready accessto the media. .

The adage that ‘there is no such
thing as bad publicity’ holds true for

disabled persons as a minority_

group. _ln_the past, we have expe-
rienced difﬁculty ob_taini_ng the most

sons, we are at last being heard-

My biggest objection to -Mr. Col--
lins’ article, however, is that he
seems to have failed to ask disabled
persons what we are doing to cele-
brate the International Year of Dis-
abled Persons. -Had he done so, he
would have learned (right here on
campus from the Director of Special
Student Service) that on September

I2, 1981, there will be an IYDP ',

Rally in Point State Park. This rally
will be attended by all groups of
physically and mentally handi-
capped persons in Allegheny
County as well as by the public. One

. purpose of the rally is to register

disabled voters. Another is to pro-

mote awareness of our abilities as '

well as our needs. An empty cause? I

work towards the goal of ensuring
that no future discussions of tuition
be allowed to take place without
medical student representation and
faculty participation. No longer will
the Dean, Vice-Chancellor and
Chancellor be permitted to “take no
prisoners" or leave no witnesses.
Never again should medical students
permit themselves to leave the cam-
pus in June without knowing about
tuition decisions. The administra-
tion will have to work very hard to
regain the precious student trust that
the Dean's office has squandered.

The parents of medical students
should join the fray. Who knows
better than they the anxiety and ali-
enation created by 30-50%-
thousands of dollar increases in
tuition? The joy of gaining accep-
tance to medical school is quickly
soured by the realization that the
Dean of the School of Medicine
knew for two months before the offi-
cial announcement date that tuition
at Pitt would increase by more than
2,000-5,000 dollars. Parents of
f£esh_rr_ia_n medical students arejusti—
fiably angry that the magnitude of
the impending tuition increases was
known with certainty to Pitt admin-
istrators at a time when their sons
and daughters held outstanding let-
ters of acceptance to several other

medical schools with much lower

tuitions. There are more than l,000
parents of current Pitt medical stu-
dents. Members of each family
should write to their legislators in
the Pennsylvania State Congress
informing them in their own per-
sonal terms of the impact of the
unprecedented tuition increases and
the clandestine and devious manner
in which they are arrived at and
sprung on their children. You must
act not only for your own children
but for the other families whose
children one day will also follow the
challenging and rewarding pat_l1_ of
medicine at the only medical school
in the western part of the state. Your
letters will help keep the gold ring
within reach of all of the young peo-
ple in Pennsylvania. Tell your con-
gressman also that foundation"-
grants are _being squandered and
that l7 million dollars is sloshing
around in secret practice plan con-
tracts and agreements that are
beyond the control of the Dean.
Finally, demand that the University
of Pittsburgh School of Medicine be
audited by the state. How much
more evidence of incompetent mis-
management do you need before
you act‘? '

The fact that financial problems
in the School of Medicine are so
enormous and the resources are so
unwisely managed~—that have
resulted in huge and unprecedented

tuition increases~compel the
elected representatives ofthe people
of Pennsylvania to investigate the
state-supported medical school.
They must ask hard. clearquestions,
the answers to which will bring the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine back within reach of all
our citizens. Perhaps one of our con-
gressmen will ask Dr. Posvar for the
record, if he still believes the School
of Medicine is a private institution.

The list of potential advocates
who might be enlisted to resist the
imperial trends in the School of
Medicine should include faculty
members; unfortunately with few
exceptions, the faculty seems preoc-
cupied with recovering money some
of them spent on foreign travel to
places like Iran (trips designed to
benefit their own bank accounts)~or
developing their own fiefdoms in the
Health Center, or quietly maintain-
ing low profiles in the hope of
obtaining a l0(% cost of living
increase in salary or holding on to
the privilege of sending their kids to
Pitt for free. We can expect little
from these comfortable scholars and
academicians. Damn the students
and the taxpayers who pay their
salaries, full speed ahead!

In any event, Mr. Collins‘ choice
of the disabled mountain climbers as
an IYDP happening is a poor one,
although l, for one, think these per-
sons deserve all the awards and cov-
erage they can get. What’s important
here is that it took something like
IYDP to unite disabled. persons,
who heretofore tended to segregate
into little clusters, say disabled*vete-
rans in one group, the blind in
another, with no common goal and
hence no real power. Things are
beginning to happen for us now.

With this new-found media coop-

not only here in Allt:_gh_eny County

abledpersons in larger numbers and
to inform them of legislation, pro-
grams, etc. that affect us all. Coun-
ties and states across the country
have formed liaison IYDP commit-
tees, and for the first time local, state
and federal governments are open-
ing their doors and listening to us.
We realize change comes slowly, but
we’re making headway in such areas
as housing, employment and
education. .

us who are handicapped and

in l982? We’re still going to have
problems, just as thereare still child-

believe we will have been heard. And
if, for our efforts, we reach just one
person, if we convince that one per-
son that those of us with disablilities
are equal, contributing members of
society, IYDP will not have been in
vain.

Imagine this scenario: Pitt
Athletic Director Cas Myslinski
receives a telephone call last Tues-
day evening from Senior Vice Chan-
cellor Jack Freeman. On the eve of a
meeting of Eastern university
athletic directors and representa-
tives to discuss the proposed Eastern
sports league, Myslinski gets orders

from Freeman to be in Philly in the '

morning to attend the meeting.

A newspaper article in a Pitts-
burgh paper Friday supposedly
details the machinations behind
Myslinski’s unexpected appearance
and Pitt’s reversal of interest in the

league after weeks of denying attrac- V

tion to the proposal.

The article claims at a secret meet-
ing Tuesday night ‘Pitt's Board of
Trustees ordered M yslinski’s sudden
trip through Freeman. Apparently,
such action contradicted Chancellor
Wesley Posvar’s earlier comments in
a -‘letter that was mailed to the

, involved schools stating Pitt was not
. interested in the new league.

After attending the meeting, Mys-
linski said, “More teams are ‘think-

point, we’re moving in the right
direction.” . e

ln one corner, we have Pitt Chan- '

cellor Wesley Posvar running
through a checklist of “bad press"
items at M-onday’s Pitt Senate
Council meeting and slapping each
issue with a sharp retort. _

There was the medical school’s

tarnished reputation to refute, the .
decrying of the Texas scam that‘

bilked a hefty $l.S million from
Pitt’s bankroll, and the little matter
of just what changed in Pitt’s policy
toward a new sports league after
Myslinski’s trip to Philly.

Posvar said nothing. “Pure fan-;.

tasy” is what Posvar termed pub-

~lished accounts of Pitt’s-~alleged

aboutface toward the proposed

league. He denied any “sudden"shift ,-
in interest and characterized Mys- ‘

linski’s attendance only as another
sign that “Pitt is willing to talk, but is
not aggressively pursuing the idea”.

Posvar added the unidentified‘

well-placed administrative official in

Posvar said Pitt is interested in

organization, academic ', standards
and ﬁnancing ofany new. league.

ton College in the Big East and stiﬂe
the threat a new conference poses.

.» - But a university official conﬁrmed‘

Friday that Pitt did receive an offer _

to immediately join the Big East,
owner of a $2" million TV package.

“That's correct——they would
accept us immediately,” the source
said. “The key to the new conference
monetarilyl is basketball. Basketball
is where money is made in thistype
of all-sports conference. The NCAA
sells its television rights for football
in'one package, but the NCAA has
no specific restrictions against sel-

' ling basketball packages. ‘_ \

“Basketball finances can make a
league solvent. The i"inancial7poten-
tial of football has pretty ‘much
reachedits limit.” . - A

That Pitt -would hesitate to.-jump

' at a chance to joinithe Big East indi-. ’

cates the strengthof its position in

. "any'_Eastern sports league——-be it the

proposed Eastern league,_the ﬁnan-

cially successful Big_vEast, or the

shaky Eastern 8. d _ ,_
“Right now ‘Pit-t holds the keyvto

the ’ ‘whole “thing,” said_, Billick.‘ A
_d“Obvio,u_sly one of the reasons, the‘
Big'East,is interested in usis,“ if we go‘ '

Easterniconference.’-’ ' , ‘

Or, as the source said: “When the
athletic directorsimeet on the. new.
league again, Pitt will want to stop

withxthe Big East“, there would be. no

the generalities and talk specifics. '

All the details should be discussed. If
after that‘is done, we likethe results,
we’ll say yes. If not, _we’ll , say no.

Intelligent planning, not time, is.

most important.” .

RTS BRIEFS

S iriano leads way...

Former Pitt Panther distance star
Gary Siriano led the Pittsburgh
Allegheny/ Nike team to the
National AAU l5-kilometer Road
Race Championship in Utica, N.Y.
Saturday. I

Siriano led the Allegheny team
with a fourth—place finish, covering
the course in 46:0l.0. Other top fin-
ishers for the team included: Steve
_Littleton-eighth. Robin Holland-
lOth, Ken Trilli-l4th, Henry Phelan-
loth, and Joe Worden-l9th. « ‘

The race, also known as the
“Utica Boilermaker", was run in 9|-
degree heat and 87 percent humid-
ity. The Greater Boston Track Club,
last year’s winner. wilted to fourth-
place this year.

Jacobs rushingthings...

Pittsburgh Colt running back
Freddie Jacobs, former Pitt half-
back. has blazed a hot trail for the
Colts in their first three games. And
often his path has extended all the
way to the goal line.

Jacobs, leads the Colt team in
rushing through its first three
games--all victories—»wit‘n 309
yards on 45 carries. with seven
touchdowns. Against Erie. two
weeks ago, Jacobs scored two touch-
downs, one on a run of 78 yards.
Last week, in the Colts’58-3 victory
over Niagara, Jacobs scored four
touchdowns, two rushing and two
recieving. V

Seems Freddie’s still fast.

* * >l= * * '

Boyarsky signs. ..

Jerry Boyarsky, former Pitt def-
ensive lineman, has just signed ‘a
one-year contract with the New
Orleans Saints. ~At 6'3” and 270
pounds, Boyarsky is now in training
running four miles a day in prepara-
tion for the Saints’ upcoming train-
ing camp.

Saints coach Bum Phillips says
Boyarsky is his type of player even
though Boyarsky runs the 40-yard
dash in 5.4 s‘eeonds—a snail’s pace
by NFL standards.

“‘He' don’t look pretty and you
hate to watch ’em run, but put a

JERRY BOYARSKY

brick wall in tront of him and he can
still do that 40 in 5.4," Phillipsjoked

in a phone conversation with

Boyarsky’s agent Ralph Cindrich.
Boyarsky was the Saints’ fith-

round choice in April’s NFL draft.

The next best thing?...

Even though the major league
baseball players’ strike has wiped
out this year’s regularly scheduled
All-Star game, host-city Cleveland
threw a mock version of the game
last night to fill the void.

Hall iof Fame pitcher Bob Feller. a
‘former/ Cleveland lndian , was to
throw out the first die to kick offa
Strat-o—matic board game version of
the All-Star game. Two local televi-
sion producers hosted the game at
home plate of Cleveland Municipal
Stadium. Two participants using
dice and cards with computerized
data on the players’ record repre-
sented the National and American
Leagues.

The pre-game, All-Star

g festivities-a downtown ethnic food

festival, evening party, and Revolu-
tionary War battle drills-—-all went

on as scheduled.
I * * * #1!

Free Bear?. ..

Alabama football coach Paul
“Bear" Bryant says he’s embarassed
by efforts by his supporters who are
seeking to have the Alabama State
Legislature pass a new law designed
to permit him to coach beyond the
state mandatory retirement age of
70.

Bryant. 67, as an employee of a
state university, is affected by the
retirement law which his backers are
seeking to rescind. A member ofthe
Alabama Congress suggested last
week that Alabama offer Bryant an
emeritusupost once he reaches the
retirement age, which would avoid
necessitating a law change and per-
mit Bear to continue coaching with
pay past the age of 70.

Bryant said Saturday he will work
for free if it will end the controversy
over the state law. He needsjust nine
victories to pass the legendary Amos
Alonzo Stagg in career-coaching
wins.

Steelers open camp...

Five ex-Panthers will join 60
other players scheduled to report for
tomorrow’s first day of the _Pitts-
burgh Steelers training camp at St.
Vincent College in Latrobe. V

Trocano, along with free agents Wil-
lie Collier, Mike Dombrowski,
