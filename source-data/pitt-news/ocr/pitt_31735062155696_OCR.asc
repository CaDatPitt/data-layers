Band Approves

Only two men were in favor of
drum majorettes. James Nycum,
Eng. ’56, said that he believed that
he was speaking for all the other
members of the band when he said
that both cheerleaders and drum
majors of the female variety are
needed to bolster school spirit.

The need to increase school spir-
it was the reason given most often
by those who favored women
cheerleaders. “Drum majorettes
aren’t good, but girl cheerleaders
are needed,"says R. A. Macon,
Col. ’56. “Our present cheerleaders
don’t compare well to other
school’s cheerleaders,” he added.

Females Would Bolster

Gaeton De-Martino, Col. ’54;
wants Pitt to have women cheer-
leaders because other schools do
and “I think they would bolster
the student cheering section.” _

Tony Monteleone, Col. ’54, thinks
that women, cheeleaders would
deﬁnitely perk up the cheering
section. Wally Jaap, Eng. ’55,
agrees with the others: “I think
universities should‘ have women
cheerleaders .to promote. school

eighth ﬂoor lounge. 1

He stated his goals asthe building of goodwill, prestige,
better morale and the dissemination of information in the

University of Pittsburgh. “But everyone engages in public.

men. The congressmen felt that

word of ‘mouth from the students
was one of the most effective
methods for publicizing the Uni-
versity.
Respect Means Employment

Emphasizing his point concern-
ing better public relations from
the students themselves, the coun-
selor continued: “If it (the Pitt

then the graduates will be em-

‘Simplicity Is Trade Mark

Prof Shapes People

By, NANCY scnon -

 

Outspoken Walter Sobotka, professor at the Schqol of
Retailing, gives students in h-is classes in design and mer-
chandise information a “continental” outlook on life and

architecture.

It is natural for Professor Sobotka to put the two to-
gether, because‘ his whole life‘has been devoted to architec-
ture. He believes that nothing inﬂuences the way people
live as much as their surroundings.

Vienna-born and educated, Pro-
fessor Sobotka played an import-_
ant part in the modern European
‘architecture movement in the
1920's and ’30’s. He has pictures

' to prove that he used the “revo-

lutionary” ideas known in the
U. S. today as Swedish Primitive
as far back as 1925. ,
Architects’ Background Deﬁcient
In comparing American archi-
tecture with what he did in Vien-
na, Professor Soobtka claims that
today’s architects are not given the
educational background that he
received at the Technological In-
stitute of Vienna. He can still
draw the Parthenon, detail for de-

‘tail, as he learned it.

This classical knowledge gives
an architect a fund of old ideas
on which he can build new,‘ imag-
inative forms. Unless today’s stu-
dents, with their skill at line and
form, are associated with ﬁne men
in the ﬁeld, they are in danger of
becoming nothing but draftsmen.

Simple lines in furniture. and
houses designed to serve functional
purposes were Professor Sobot-
ka's trade marks. As a specialist
in chairs and furniture, he be-
lieved that each .piece should be
more elegant and pleasing than
the last. He even cut the woods
for his custom-made furniture to
make sure that each piece repre-
sented the ﬁnest wood._\

Novelties Only Skin-Deep

Today, he claims, designers try

. Professor Walter Sobotka
Devoted To Architecture

too hard to use “skin-deep” nov-
elties in the construction of fur-
niture.

Also, he believes in the use of
traditional, English prints with
modern furnishings to give the set-
tings warmth, instead of the cold,
austere appearance they can have.

_One of Professor Sobotka’s fav-
urite jobs as a free-lance archi-
tect in Vienna, one in which he

spirit among the women as well
as the men students,” he says.

, They Add Color, ‘Too

Bob Brenneman, Col. ’54, is the
other of the two men who istin
favor of both women cheerleaders
and drum majorettes. He ,wants
both at Pitt because they will give
the games a colorful atmosphere.
Merle DeLuca, Ed. ’54, and Don
Niphs, Eng. ’56, both favor women
cheerleaders because they add
color.

Several men favor women cheer-
leaders but give no speciﬁc reas-
ons. Band member Anthony Ara-
bia, Col. ’57, has had ﬁve years
experience in high school bands.
He says that drum majorettes are
good for appearance but would
never be with Pitt’s all male band.
“But girl cheerleaders would be
terriﬁc!” said Arabia.

--Both Paul Blanda, Ed. ’55, and
Ron Chleboski, Eng. ’56, want
women cheerleaders, although
neither would state any speciﬁc
reason. Bob Hersho, Col. ’54, says
“I’m all for female cheerleaders,
but majorettes are out of the ques-
tion." .

They,Are the Most

Jack Watlins, Eng. ’55, sums up
the feelings of all the men when
he says, “I don’t believe that ma-
iorettes will ﬁt in with our type
marching band, but women cheer-

M a jorettes

leaders are the most, to say the
least.” .

Turning to the wo;nen’s replies
to thequestion, we ﬁnd they‘ gen-
erally do not want women cheer-
leaders and drum majorettes.
R056 Dﬂmian, Col. ’56, says that
the big attraction at the game was
the looks of the majorettes.
“Those majorettes hardly did any
twirling at all,” she pointed out.

Girls Want Boys

“Boys make better cheerleaders
than girls because girls continually
fuss over their hair and don’t care
as much about cheering as the im-
pression they’re making)? said
Clara _0rtiz, Ed. '55. Following
through with the same idea, Nan
Taylor, Col. ’56, said that boys are
more interested in promoting
school spirit——girls in promoting
themselves-

A graduate student, * Greta
Band. said that she believed that
bringing girls into athletics gives
too much of a high school attitude
for a ‘university.

Shirley Moore, Col. ’57, says
that she thinks that the band is
tops as is but the cheering ‘could’
be pepped up by the presence of
girl cheerleaders.”

The majority of the opinions was
given by Dorothea Hohmann, Col.
’56, when she said, “The student
body willcheer louder and longer
for women cheerleaders.”

Teaching Orders the Mind

Professor Sobotka came to the
U. S. from Austria in 1938. After
working with Brentwood Furni-
ture and Russell Wright for three
years, he decided that “Teaching

thirteen years he has been at the

In One Of Many Programs In

near the hot
wall will ex-
pand and ﬂow
upward while .
the ﬂuid near the cold. wall con-
tracts and ﬂows down. A slow,
steady circulation results. The ex-
pansion of a heated object and a
contraction of a cooled object is
a natural phenomenon and is
utilized here for liquids.

Moleéules Migrate

Besides the vertical circulation
of the liquid a horizontal migra-
tion of molecules (the smallest
unit of the compound) occurs be-
tween the hot and cold liquid
regions.

Different types of molecules
will, on the average, gain and
lose different quantities of energy

  
 
  
  
  
  

DeNinno

during such migrations. There-
fore, there is a tendency for one
portion of the original mixture to
collect in the hot, up-ﬂowing
ﬂuid and to be concentrated at the
top of the apparatus. The other
portion of the mixture will col-
lect at the bottom. This is accom-
plishes the separation.

According to Professor Jones,
substances of similar molecular
weights but dissimilar structure
can be separated. ,

Weight Equals Numbers

and Types
~ The molecular weight of the
compound will depend on the
numbers and types of atoms it
contains. The molecular structure
will depend on the manner in
which the atoms are joined to-‘
gether.

As an example of a use for the

‘process, Professor Jones said that

lubricating oils could be greatly
improved upon.

He added that if crude oil were
pumped through the equipment,
thepetroleum that came oﬁ one
end would be a better lubricant

than that coming off the other -

end.

It is interesting to note here
that much of the basic work on
the project is being done by the
Standard Oil Company of Ohio.

In the wake of a successful High School Day, we feel
_ that there are those who deserve special praise for out-

in for their share of the laurels. While the opposition may
not have been Notre Dame or Minnesota calibre, they were

the Athletic Department contributed a. priceless but little

dents when they graciously arranged for refresh ents to
be served to the more than 350 majorettes who pe formed.

the stands was a wonderful demonstration of gratitude.-

The High ’/School Day committee went, almost unheard of
but they completed their tasks in ﬁne ‘style and did much
to enhance our standing with area high schools. Special
mention should be made of the work done by John Ney,
Paul Harrison, Jim Bender, Jim DeWeese, and Dr. Donald
E. Swartz for their work on the special edition of the Pitt

of the event. There are others who contributed no small

Educaﬁon Is up To us .

 .By Elinore Stone _’ 
If there’s one .thing.Colleger teaches___‘y.ou, it’s

“that education is.an individual matter. V'A'nd_h it
doesn’t end at 21. "" S J

Inhigh school, the curriculum is designed to see
that the student learns such and such, and stays
there until he does. So many facts, so many names,
and just’ as many dates are essential before he too
canbe called a-“high school graduate.” The in-
dividual actually need not do much.

But College is a wide open ﬁeld. The institu- ‘

tion isn"t set up to see that so many students “re-
ceive” an education. It has no such duty. Rather,
its aim is to. see that we are given the opportuni-
ty to learn. . ' C

And thetteachers can't be expected to see that
we learn. Their aim is to stimulate andpto help us
educate. ourselves; to invite us to learn andgset us

to seeking the pnswers-to life’s varied questions. .

S College doesn’t answer the questions. It doesn't
even pretend to. 7 _ _

It _has admittedly taken some of us, and I use

the editorial “us,” almost four years to realize the

Te be speciﬁc, we  individuals must. investi; ‘i
gate, question, doubt, experiment and search if

we wish to truly learn. It"s nobody’s loss but our
own if wezgraduate having learned nothing.

We can't blame it on back luck with “lousy
courses” and “poor teaching,” granted we've all
had some of both, for there’s no limit to educa-
tion if our own initiative is working.

The facilities are ‘everywhere. Anfl there’s so

much to learn.

\

Furthermore, our education doesn’t end when A

I personally feel much as I did when I graduated
from high school.

I felt then something was incomplete, but plan-

-four years for some sort of miraculous fulﬁllment. ~

Now, I still feel my education is incomplete.

lAnd it‘is. Because, actua_ll.y it’s just beginning.

being lost. I was getting ready to learn; to learn

“Give Light"? . . 

By Paul Harrison

We have’ three major newspa-"
pers in our town; the Post-Gaz— _

ette, the Sun-Telegraph and the
Pitt News. We also have an ad-
vertising sheet run by a‘news—
paper chain which, once in a
while, carries a newsy ‘story.
This big money paper displays
an editorial. page which is de-
voted mainly to letters from the
people of our town, If we would
look hard enough we could even
notice the sheet has a few high
paid editorial writers who try to
inﬂuence the minds of the people
of ourptown.
Last Thurs.da.y, with nothing to
do but cr-am for seven mid—term
.majors, I picked this bale of con-
densed wood pulp from the
bushes of our front yard (the
newsboy ﬁgures nobody will
steal it that way) and proceeded
to read “Pogo,” the paper’s one
highlight in the mass of a propa-
ganda. Still chuckling, I picked
myself from the ﬂoor and battled
my way through 891/4 pages of
. . . . yes ads. With sections scat-
tered about I came to a page
hidden deep in the 17th section.

A Memo, To A Lighthouse

The editorial page.
Far up in the left handicorner
of the page is a lighthouse be-

lieved to have been originated \by’

Rusty Draper. Under the small
cut the motto says simply, “Give
li.ght and the people will ﬁnd
their own way.” That’s quite a

motto. I’ll wager the Duquesne _

Light Company never thought of
that. .

’Then I saw it. There was
something about Pitt on the page.
Pitt! Just imagine, we hit the
editorial page! .

I read it. A dark cloud de-
scended upon the Iwhole world.
The writer didn’t mind our“‘Oak-
land school” achieving all the
glory it could but he deﬁnitely
did not want a street named
after it. '

Now I wonder if our friend
was in Oakland last Saturday

I when as always we had a large

number of out-of-town visitors
to the culture center of our town.
I was standing at the corner of

Reminds Me of the ‘Time . 4. .I

‘ By Vince Leonard

A cop gave me a ticket for
speeding home from the Pitt
game last week along with an
ear—splitting vituperation (chew-
ing out) ‘on the rudiments of
driving.

Heeding his sagacious counsel,
I began clipping along at a dan-
gerous -30 mph, and, with plenty
of time to kill, I began to rehash
the vivid incidents of my very
ﬁrst driving lesson.

It all started way back 'when
. . . no new-fangled hydramatics,
dynaﬁows, power—gli.des,
drives, automatics . . . just the
plain, old, natural-born standard
shift. ‘

One humid, July afternoon
when I had originally planned on
swimming, Bushy, my blond,
freckled friend picked me up in
his ’35 Dodge heap. Without a
license or even a permit himself,
hedecided to give me a driving
lesson.

The bucket-0’-bolts ‘chugged
and sputtered to a remote hill’top
and my lesson began. I released
the clutch too fast and a grind-
ing noise resulted. Too much
pressure on the gas pedalpcziused
a deafening roar.

With a jerk (mechanical and I

human.) the car. shot forward. I
ripped it into second gear and
then into third.‘ Ah, smooth
driving was‘ in effect now. I

neared a turn-off and stopped as ‘

my instructor instructed.
Taking a lesson in reverse
driving, I backed uprather.su<'h:,,—

cessfully. Again pestered by the
accelerator and clutch trouble, I
then zdomed the car straight for
a steep ‘(what else are they?)
precipice on the opposite side of
the ‘road.

Four hands and feet reached
futilely for steering wheel, brake
pedal, hand brake, ‘and clutch.
Our both tryingleither to turn or
to stop resulted in a field goal
like passing (inﬂuence of grid
season.) .between two uncabled

pposts. Although the steep drop
‘was still there, the car stopped

dead after plunging only a few
feet. It got tangled in a maze of
foliage and shriveled twigs and
branches! (Honest. Ask Bushy.)
Terriﬁed  and g e n u i n e 1 y
“shook,” we climbed out the half-
turned car. This was the first
time I had to climb up the sitting.‘
surface of the front seat to get
out of a car. Something like an
inebriated gentleman clinging to
the edge of the curb, I guess.
Anyhow, having no money for

a regular tow, Bushy decided ,to_

call a substitute to perform the
job. At the closest ‘house, a coun-
try mile (Man, they’re long) up
the road, we phoned for help.
While we were waiting
thoughts like: “Will the car

hold?”; “Can it be towed out?”; ,

“Will the cops find it?”; and “I
should’ve gone 'swimming,”. arose.

When Bushy’s boss’s truck ar-,

rived, we directed the driver to

the scene of our. mishap. 'I‘her_e;.

went over the course with me.

Okay Mr. Editorial Writer,
here are my views. »It could be

of the streets and “Give people

Pitt Boulevard. Even better, you
and some of your staff could erect

Prof atPitt
HomeAgain

 By CECY ‘LINCOFF
Back in Pittsburgh this year

after an absence of more than

1-5 years is Dr. John McCarthy,

- the newest addition to the

University’s philosophy de-
partment. He has been engaged
here in connection with the gen-

’, eral education program being tried .
 in many departments, because of

his work in this field at both _Co-
lumbia and Louisville.

The smiling author-professor
says he has always been “involved
in’ a type‘of intellectual work.”

,Before taking a posi.tion in the
philosophy program at University
of‘Louisville four years ago, he
taught at a boys’ school in Chi-
cago and worked with a publish-
ing company in New York City.

Eclectic Thinker

‘Dr. "McCarthy subscribes to the
eclectic thought of philosophy-.
That is, he examines history and
takes those ideas which seem to

be ﬁtted together and integrates

them so as to apply them to_ the
Philosophy of Samuel Alexander,
about whom Dr. McCarthy recent-
ly wrote a book. Leading ideas in
speciﬁc ﬁelds are summarized and
evaluated in an attempt to sys-
tematize them. _

Also an enthusiastic advocate of
general education, Dr. McCarthy
worked on a program with ‘the

law and medical schools at Louis-'
‘ ‘ville which explored points, giv-

ing’ each profession a better ‘under-
standing of the other. It was hoped
that the lack of understanding
which arises as a result from the
speciﬁcally professional approach
would be overcome.

General Ed Gives Major Concepts

He explains the new type of ed-
ucation as familiarizing the_com-
mon man with the major concepts
of many ﬁelds rather than having
him specialize in one ﬁeld.

It is an integration of many sub-
jects and in Dr. McCarthhy’s
words, there is “more intellectual
stimulation in the universities with
the general education programs,
than those without them.”

In trying to adopt the new pro-

cess, the professor remarked that
a problem lies in re-educating the
teachers in the methods of teach-
ing. They will, in a sense, have to
become students all over again. ‘
lnconnection with his work at
University of Louisville, Dr. Mc-
Carthy was among many educa-
tors who gave a series of courses
in the public libraries. The series
was sponsored by the city hnd was
free to the public.

John McCarthy, who spent his
freshman year at Pitt, has re-
turned as a teacher in the philo- '
sophy department in connection

ments.‘ Before coming to the

and at a boys’ school in Chicago.

Fourth Frosh Win F ails
To Scare Bullis Coach

By LYNN

WATSON

V Pitt’s freshman gridders kept their perfect record intact
and got Navy’s goat besides .last Saturday, 26-14, but head
coach Bill Deming of Bullis Prep,,this Saturday’s opponents,

apparently wasn’t too impressed"“‘“

after‘ scouting the game, as he
promised Pitt Coach Steve Petro
that his Bullis squad would give

the undefeated Panther Cubs a

rough contest.

Deming may have bitten off too
much as the frosh displayed ex-
cellent offensive and defensive
play . against the strong ‘Navy
team in swamping the Plebes with
three touchdowns before they
could get started.

Canil Shines

Petro cited Herm Canil as turn-
fng in an excellent performance
at his tackle position by being
“outstanding in every way.” Canil,
Petro pointed out, will make a

* "bright varsity promect if he con-

tinues to improve. Petro ‘also
praised Steve Woitkovitch and
Ralph Cipers for their fine im-
provement._

Zeilienople‘s Bugs Bagamery
touched oﬁ the scoring with two
first quarter scores, the ﬁrst on a
four-yard crash through the line,
and the second on a 22-yard
scamper. Bagamery also booted
the extra point on the second tally.

Navy Recovers

Joe Walton charged ofE—tackle
and raced 19 yards to ‘give the
Panther Cubs their third touch-
down in the third quarter. Cornel-
ius Salvaterra split the uprights
to tack on the extra point and
make the score 20-0. .

In the fourth period Navy cap-
italized on an interception on the
Pitt 20 yard line and a Panther
fumble to break into the scoring

column for their two tallies.

Nittanies -Also Develop
Menacing Ground Game

By DAVE MAZER .
Two wrongs which may mean a right is what concerns

Red Dawson most this week

Knowing that slinging Tony

Rados has had- two poor Saturdays in a row, the slow-
speaking Dawson remarks, “That’s what I’m worried about.
He probably won’t have three, bad games in a row.”

So, with this inmind and also that in the absence of
Rados’ sensational passing Penn State has uncorked a strong

ground game, the Panthers wenté

into their ﬁnal week of practice at
Trees Field.

The Nittany Lions, the Blue and
Gold’s arch rival, have already
compiled a respectable 5-3 record
and would enjoy nothing more
than to cap the season with a win
over our revenge-seeking eleven.

Pitt Well-scouted

For this purpose, the Staterst

have gone to extreme scouting
measures to gain knowledge about
the Panthers. Assistant coach Al
Michaels has been watching the
Dawsonmen in their last four con-
tests and should know almost as
much as Dawson does about their
strong and weak points.

An all-out effort by both sides,
then, shapes up for local fans at
the Stadium because the Panthers
are out to win for several reasons.

First of all, the Pitts need this
victory to exhibit at least a 4-4-1
chart for the luckless 1953 season,
which - has seen losses to Notre
Dame by nine points, to West Vir-
ginia by ten, and to Northwestern
by six.

Revenge Motive

Secondly, the Panthers have a
little remembrance from last fall
to settle with the Nittanies. Going
into the same ﬁnale with State in

Collegians Rap
Dons, 33-9

By GENE ARUMATORIO
In a bitterly fought contest
played at Schenley Oval Monday
night the Collegians whipped the

‘Dons 33-9 to snatch the Section 2

championship of the Independent
League. The title match found
tempers ﬂaring and play becoming
rough as blocks were thrown that
would do justice to the old single
wing type of football.

Play started with the Collegians
receiving the kickoff, which saw
quarterback Ray Rizzo injured
while returning the ball. On the
third play from scrimmage Ed
Danyluk was thrown for a safety
to give the Dons an early 2-0 lead.

However, this didn’t last long as

1952, the Pitts were headed for the
Orange Bowl in Red Dawson’s ﬁrst
semester as head coach. The Lions
rolled in and that Saturday rolled
out with a 17-0 triumph and the
Panthers hopes of a gay New
Year’s Day in Miami.

Thirdly, eight Panthers will be
ending their college careers Sat-
urday and three straight successes
with the clincher on the Mt. Nit-
tany boys would be as pleasant a
conclusion as they could hope for.

Heading the list of seniors is
Captain Dick Deitrick. The Dan-
ville right end will be back at his
position after an injury as will be
Fullback Bobby Epps.

Two Seniors on Bench

Left End Joe Zombek, Half-
back Ray Ferguson, Fullback Joe
Capp, and End Ken Voytell are the
other departing gridders who op-
pose the Lions while End Bill Ad-
ams and Guard Bill Priatko view
their last tilt from the bench since
they sustained injuries.

Tackle Dick Gatz, a ﬂrst—string
performer since the Northwestern
battle, is listed as a senior but still
has another year of eligibility. The
Carnegie grad transferred from
Kansas after the 1951 season.

Meanwhile, Pitt followers who
want to see more of sophomore
Bob Grier, ground-gaining star
against North Carolina State, got a
promise from Dawson. The Red-
head said Grier will deﬁnitely
play, if at all possible; so now the
enthusiasts hope that “if at all
possible” means. a second chance
to see the free-running fullback.

I
Rizzo returned to the game and
immediately went into action. On
the ﬁrst play Rizzo tossed a long
pass to Ed Danyluk that was good

for a ﬁrst down. On the next play_

Rizzo picked up- some excellent
blocking as he ran for the ﬁrst
Collegian touchdown.

On their ﬁrst effort from scrim-
mage the Collegians pulled a
beautiful play as ‘Rizzo shoveled
the ball to Danyluk and then
streaked downﬁeld to receive
Dan luk’s pass to put the ball past

 WoIfpack Couch 
Scutlles Story

Sports Editor

An unusual sidelight of the North Carolina State game
last Saturday developed in the pressbox and carried right
down to the playing ﬁeld, which’is= a complete reversal of
the normal direction of inﬂuence.

During the time Pitt was methodically dismantling the
hapless Wolfpack, the corps of working newsmen objectively
and_ unenthusiastically recorded the grisly details. With the
‘score at.40-6, the Carolina represeptatives had long since
sunk into‘ apathetic silence, except for State coach Mike
Karmazin, who poured the usual stream of advice and criti-
cism through the telephone line to his bench. It is the job
of the coach in the pressbox '
to spot the plays from his high
vantage point and relay infor-
mation to the tablein front of
the bench.

The crowd, mean-
while, was being treated
to a rare display of break-
away running by Panther
Fullback Bob Grier, who
clipped off 198 yards be-
fore retiring in the fourth
period. When the press-
box PA announcer, Ed
Zadorozny, gave Grier’s
total, one of the Pitts-
burgh writers wondered

age approached the rec-
ord. Then the fun start-
ed.

As soon as the record book

Grier

‘ showed that only two more yards were needed to tie War-

ren Heller’s mark set in 1930 against Penn State, Myron
Cope, of the Post—Gazette, decided to inform Pitt Coach Bob
Timmons, who was on the Pitt phone in the next room.
Timmons called down to Bob Friedlund and Red Dawson,
who promptly summoned Grier and sent him back into the
game. '

Karmazin, who was all ears throughout the -business,
called his bench and delightedly let the cat out of the bag,
whereupon State immediately sent a messenger into the line-
up.

At this point the Pittsburgh writers sat up and began
pulling for Pitt to get the ball, if only for a single play,
to give the Massilon soph a crack at the mark. The Wolf-
pack seemed to play inspired ball as they struggled to .
keep possession and run out the clock, which they did by
stalling and delaying the game. "‘

On one play, with about two minutes to go, a State back '

broke through the line momentarily and vainly‘ struggled
against his Pitt tackler. One of the eager writers got a laugh
when he blurted, “Let him go!” A State touchdown would
have given Pitt possession with enough time for a whole
series of plays. Anything for a story.

When the game broke up, Karamazin picked up his
papers and started for the door. Someone, probably from the
Pitt News, called to him, “Unsportsmanlike!”

“It’s unsportsmanlike to run up 40 points, too,” be
snapped.

How about all the rookies we had in the lineup, Mike?’

Collegians Win

* the mid-ﬁeld stripe. The next play

saw Rizzo fading back and throw-
ing a long pass that was intercept-
ed by the Dons’ Mel Haber but the
Dons couldn’t roll.

The Johnstowners then started
to move and soon had their second
touchdown by way of a Rizzo-to-
Danyluk pass. .

Play settled down as the Col-
legians again began to move, _.cli-
maxing the march by a touch-
down pass from Rizzo to Mike
Dragovich. The score then read,
Collegians 20, Dons 2.

The Dons got moving after re-
ceiving the kickoff as Larry Liv-
ingston heaved a long pass to Don
Veal that put the ball on the two-
yard line. The next play again
saw Livingston pass to Veal for

the lone Don touchdown. The first
half ended with the Collegians
leading, 20-9.

The second half opened with
Rizzo intercepting a Livingston
pass which set up another touch-
down for the winners. This time
the scoring pass went from Riizo
to Danyluk.

The last score of the game found
Rizzo heaving a long pass to Al
Salem in the end zone that was
good for another six points, thus
chalking up the ﬁnal score at
33-9.

A quick-witted college student decided to add a new sport

He walked into the local sportswear shop and said, “Let me
see your smartest checked sport shirts." '

The clerk showed him several Van Heusen FIELDWOOD
CHECK Sport Shirts. “These are the ﬁnest I've got," he
beamed. “The fabric is 55% wool and 4 5% rayon-—for
kitten’s-ear softness and long, long wear. They can be laun-
dered in lukewarm water. And you can choose from a wide
selection of small and medium-size checks.. .and only $7.95
apiece.”

“Just what I was looking for,” said the student. “I'll take
this one with the medium-size checks.”

The clerk wrapped the shirt and handed it to him. “That

_ will be $7.95," he said.

“On second thought, ‘I'll take that one with the small
checks," said the student.

The obliging clerk unwrapped the first shirt, wrapped the
second one and handed it» to the student, who turned to
leave. “Just a minute," cried the clerk. "You forgot to pay
for it."

"I gave you the other shirt for it,” answered the youth.

“But you didri't"pay for the other shirt,” continued the
clerk. '

“Naturally! I didn't buy that one!”

Job Prospects Good |A N.g|1I'Oul|

In Education Field

Tabulations of job opportunities for 1953 Pitt graduates
show the teacher, pharmacist, nurse, business administra-
tion, science or liberal arts students are in as much demand

as the engineer.

George W. Hoffman, director of
merit bureau, reports that 3,1360‘-W

vacancies were registered with the
biueau last year for the 175 avail-
able teachers. This means there is
an average of 18 job opportunities
for each education‘ graduate.

The 118 engineering and mines
graduates available for placement
last June averaged 10 job inter-
views each, while each of the 110
business administration. graduates
registered with the men’s place-
ment bureau, averaged 9 job in-
terviews. T .

The professional training of the
nurse and the pharmacist are much
in demand and the science and
liberal arts major averaged 7 job
interviews per man and 9 per
woman. Yearly salary for the en-
gineer av"eraged $4,191; for the
business administration student,
$4,008.

The science major averages $4,-
284: the elementary teacher, $2,-
and the secondary teacher,
$2,758. Men graduates in liberal
arts were oflered yegrly salaries
averaging $3,600, while yearly sal-
aries for women liberal arts grad-
uates averaged $2,400.

' According to Paul Sherwood,

   

the Pitt teacher’s place-
director of the Men’s Placement
Bureau, the greatest demand for
the liberal arts graduate is in -the
banking and selling ﬁelds. ‘Miss
Madlyn Martucci, director of
Women’s Placement Bureau, says,
“the liberal arts graduate has a
better chance of getting a job in
her chosen ﬁeld if she is also qual-
iﬁed to do secretarial work.”

Last Saturday 7,000 high school-
ers, and 470 teen-age majorettes
poured through the gates of the
stadium to give Pitt its best High
School Day to date.

As students entered the sta-
dium, they received a special edi-
tion of the Pitt News. Along,with
this they received a souvenir but-
ton with the words “Go Pitt Go”
on it. These mementos were dis-
tributed by student members of
the High School Day committee.

At half time the high schoolers
were treated to a show by the Mid-
land High School Band, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Varsity
Marching Band and the twirling of
470 majorettes, who performed to
“Mr. Touchdown USA."
