Students were given the opportunity to voice their opinions
and complaints to the highest—ranking officials at Pitt yesterday.

President J. Dennis O’Connor, Provost Donald Henderson,
vice president of student affairs William Harmon, athletic
director Oval Jaynes and public safety director William Brennan
held an informal question session in the William Pitt Union,
which was open to all students.

Pitt studentjames Packman began the forum by charging that
the redecoration of O’Connor’s house and office was “wasteful

spending.” Packman added that O’Connor’s stance on they

Cowell Bill was hypocritical to his new era of openness.

O’Connor defended the office redecoration, explaining that a
total of 10 people work in the office. O’Connor said he expected
to be able to work in decent conditions and nothing in the office
was overly extravagant.

On the issue of his house, O’Connor reminded Packman that
Pitt’s Board of Trustees decided to do the renovations, not
himself. O’Connor also noted that $400,000 is an outdated value
for the house and that real estate agents _estimate that its worth
is closertof $1.5 million. A

O’Connor said he is opposed to the Cowell Bill, which would

open Pitt’s financial records to the scrutiny of the public. He said
the bill has the potential to be “damaging and dangerous to the
institution.” ’

O’Connor said he is willing to disclose all ﬁnancial information
from the university when it is appropriate, but he said there are
times when it is inappropriate.

“I have disclosed more at this institution than there has been
in a long time, “O’Connor said.

Cathy Ramsey, a* part-time student at Pitt, said she was
dissatisfied with the quality of some of her professors andthat
she feels there is a lack of communication between students and
professors. H ' r B

As an example, Ramsey noted that students must type their
papers, but they are returned with illegible handwritten remarks.

Henderson said it is the students’ responsibility to make the
instructor teach. “The class can say with righteous indignation,
‘We don’t think you're doing a good job',”’ Henderson said.

He encouraged all students to come to him with problems they
feel they are having with various professors. He also encouraged
students who are having difficulty understanding a foreign
professor to make the problem known to him.

Henderson said there are instructors at Pitt who are “lousy,” but
Pitthas the means to improve their teaching if the problems are

Transportation

important for
employment,
Fleck tells CR5

By Greg Molchan
For Tbe Pitt News

Dan Fleck, county commissioner

_ candidate, campaigned last night at'a

College Republicans meeting, saying _
inadequate transportation causes
people to search for better
employmentopportunities. T

A major problem in Allegheny
County is the lack of working people
to provide taxes to the county and the
large number of senior citizens, who
require more public assistance, Fleck
said. ‘

“Allegheny County has stagnated.
There are no long-range plans to »
provide employment opportunities to
keep, as well as attract wage earners,”
Fleck stated. , .

To rectify this situation Fleck intends‘
to improve mass transportation and 0
reduce wastes in county government.

 

 

 
 

According to Fleck, the problem.  

with mass transit is that 80 percent of  I

the bus routes are in Downtown
Pittsburgh, and 75 percent of the '
population lives in the suburbs.

This problem is further escalated
when budget restraints force the -
closure of the routes that are traveled '
least. These are usually the rural routes,
Fleck said. A

To fight this problem Fleck proposed
allowing private entrepreneurs to enter.
mass transit. A person would buy. a
bus and provide increased
transportation for the city much like
the system which is currently operating
in St. Louis, Fleck said.

Fleck also wants to increase
transportation by constructing a
beltway around the city.

“Pittsburgh is laid out as a hub with
spokes. We need to build the wheel
that goes around it,” Fleck said.

According to Fleck, doing this will
open up the economic areas that are
not accessible by transit, providing

_additional industry and revenue to ‘

the city.

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Tuesday, October 29, 1991

Carnegie hosts international festival

Catherine Goldstein
Staff Writer

The Carnegie Museum, in
keeping with Andrew Carnegie’s
goal to bring international art to
Pittsburgh, is hosting its 51st
Carnegie International

Over 4,000 people viewed the
International during its opening
weekend. The art exhibit features
40 artists and over 200 pieces.

It is one of the three best-
known contemporary art exhibits
in the world, according to Elisa
M. Behnk, manager of media
relations for the Carnegie
Museum.

Each International is based on
the desires of the curators. Mark
Francis, curator of contemporary
art at the museum, described this
year’s exhibitas “exceeding our
expectations.”

“There is so much energy and
variety that there is something
for everyone. It’s something you
just have to experience,” Behnk
said.

Francis and Lynne Cooke, a
curator and a critic, spent the last
two years contacting artists from
as far west as Russia to as far east
as Japan.

These artists were then invited
to the museum to see their
allocated space and to create
something specifically for the
exhibit.

“We tried to get pieces that are
new and no one else has seen
before,” Francis said.

The exhibit contains a variety
of drawings, sculptures, paintings
and photography. '

“A lot of the work is conceptual
art —— the idea is more important

Women’: Health Services“

than the form. The museum is a
conglomerate of science, history
and music. It gives the artists
venue to react," Behnk said.

An example of this is an
installation composed of
hundreds of dinosaur bone casts.
The artist, Allan McCo1lum,
worked closely A with the
Carnegie’s Museum of Natural
History.

“It breaks the lines between

what is history and what is art,”

Behnk said.

Francis said there is a great
deal involved in coordinating a
project of this magnitude. Besides
reconstructing galleries and
obtaining funds, there are many

logistics involved. Will pieces fit

through doorways? Can a three-
ton sculpture be supported
without the ﬂoor caving in?

In addition to using various

spaces in the museum, the
International has been expanded
to a number of public places
throughout Pittsburgh.

Works by John Cage of
California and Tatsuo Miyajima
of Japan are being displayed at
The Mattress Factory, an
alternative museum on the North
Side.

Other locations include
Duquesne University and several
branches of the Carnegie Library.

As a result of the International
series, the Carnegie has been
able to build a permanent
collection throughlthe purchase
of works by the artists. Some of
the pieces acquired include works
by Willem de Kooning, john
Singer Sargent, Anselm Kief er and
Camille Picasso.

The International will run
through Feb. 16, 1992.

Vaccination a reliable P
prevention for ﬂu bug

By Richard Overmoyer
For The Pitt News

Inﬂuenza can prove deadly for those who do not take proper
precautions, according to Fred Rubin of the infectious-disease
division of the Pitt medical center. -

Rubin said ﬂu epidemics strike every year. _

“You know it's going to occur in the wintertime because it has
for the past 40 to 50 years,” Rubin said. He also said the ﬂu
commonly reaches epidemic proportions by December and
January, but indications are that this year it will be earlier.

Although there have not yet been any cultures of the ﬂu virus
identified in Allegheny County this year, West Virginia and Ohio
have reported sporadic cases, and now is the time to start
preparing, according to Rubin.

“Vaccines are the most important means of protecting against
the ﬂu,” Rubin said. Vaccines give the body the means to fight
against the virus. I

“SGB member Gil Golden asked v
the panel if they felt the student
evaluations were adequate and if
they should be made public.

. Henderson said the evaluations
“play an important part in

‘ promotion and tenure.”

He said he does look at student

' evaluations of a professor. He
’ said he did not know if they were
1 adequate because it was the first

time he had everbeen asked.
Golden cited a need for the
forms to be revised, and
Henderson did acknowledge that
they had not been revised since
they were first made.
‘ As to the request for the
evaluations to be made public,
Henderson agreed to talk with
the faculty about the possibility.

._ Golden said, “Good professors

get good evaluations. A good
professor has no reason to feel
trepidation in a public evaluation.”

Henderson said the original

agreement with the faculty was —

that the evaluations would not be
made public. Henderson said he
could not make the decision
without their approval.

Another student expressed
concern for campus safety. He
said, “What happens outside of
the ‘O’ every Thursday, Friday
and Saturday is ridiculous.” He
said he felt the loitering was
unnecessary and asked the panel
what was being done about that
as well as other campus crimes,’
warning that something must be

that Pitt police are working with
Pittsburgh police to be more
responsive to student problems.

Brennan reminded students that
Crime Stop is an important
program that needs to be
implemented to help police. “You
know who belongs in your
neighborhood better than we do,”
Brennan said. “lCrime Stop] is not
going to work unless you commit
to work with us.” ‘

The same student charged that
he went to Student Health Services
for an ingrown toenail and was
administered a prescription for
teracycline without being
examined or questioned by a
doctor.

Franklin Carter, director of
student health, who was also
present, said that the derma-
tologist makes a diagnosis based
observation. He asked the student
if the medication was working.

The student said he was not
taking the medication and had
made an appointment with his
family physician.

The student also said one of his
female friends
discontent with the gynecological
services offered at Pitt.

Carter said he had no
knowledge of such complaints.
He said, “The gynecology
department is one of the best in
the area.”

to fill out a questionnaire about
student services, which would
include SHS, but “[Studentsl are
pretty much satisﬁed.”

On the issue of ROTC,
O’Connor said he has not made a
decision yet on the Senate
committee’s recommendation.

The committee recommended
that the ROTC be removed from
campus by 1997 if it continues to
discriminate against students
based on their sexual orientation.

O’Connor said Pitt and other
universities are working together
to gather data on the situation.
He said he expects to have the
information within the next six
weeks and will make a decision
shortly thereafter.

Marcus Guy, a junior, asked
the panel to ﬁnd a solution for
students who do not receive a
validation sticker for their Pitt IDs
because their student loans have
been deferred.

Guy said students do not
receive the sticker until a third of
their tuition is paid, which can be
difﬁcult if their loans and grants
are late. He said students can not
use Pitt computing labs and
cannot participate in student
elections without a sticker.

Henderson said this was the
first time he had heard of this, but
that the problem should be
addressed. He said it ties in with
his idea of having an omnibus

person to handle the various
technical problems that arise
within the financial-aid office.

Henderson said it would be A ll 

helpful for students if they knew
“there was a live body there to
work out their problems.”

The forum was arranged by
Saunders, who has made plans

for a similar forum to be held '
once a month to give students the ‘

opportunity to talk to O’Connor
and other administrators.

Rubin said the ﬂu often goes
untreated because many people
confuse it with a common cold.
“There are a whole group of
viruses that appear to be like the

and they don’t affect as many
people,” Rubin said.

Symptoms of a cold tend to
include a runny nose, sore throat,

Rubin said hand—washing is one

of the best ways to prevent the

According to Rubin, acting on

important. “Go to the Student

Era of openness begins

Brent Saunders, Student Government Board president,
in an attempt to improve student—faculty relations, has
implemented forums which will permit students to ask
questions to university officials concerning their rights on
campus. . ‘

 Held on a monthly basis, the forums provide students
with information they might not be able to attain elsewhere.

The first forum was held yesterday in the William Pitt
Union. Although publicity for the forums was extensive,
attendance was low. Student apathy is (sadly) a major
component of Pitt life and can be partly to blame for this.
It is expected and hoped that attendance will escalate as
the monthly meetings continue.

The speakers who fielded questions from concerned

 students included Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor,
Athletic Director Ovaljaynes, Provost Donald Henderson,
Vice President for Student Affairs William Harmon and
public safety director William Brennan.

At the meeting, Henderson admitted that there are
professors at Pitt who are “lousy.” This recognition is a
perfect example of what Pitt needs. However if no
changes are made, the attempt to increase communication

is futile. .

Meanwhile, O’Connor answered inquiries from students
on subjects such as the redecoration of his. office, his
opposition of the Cowell Bill (which would allow public

access to Pitt’s financial and crime reports) and the '

renovation of his home in Shadyside.

When faced with the ever-present problem of validation
stickers, O’Connor said he was not aware of the fact that
students who cannot pay 1/ 5 of their tuition because their
loans are deferred are not given the stickers and therefore
cannot participate in student elections. or computing
services. Henderson suggested that an omnibus person
be hired to deal with such situations so that students know
“there [is] a live body out there to work out their

.4!‘ problems.” '

With the current of apathy on the University of Pittsburgh
campus as strong as it is, the forums are a step in the right
direction. Student representation was never as prevalent
at Pitt as it can be now. We encourage all students to
attend and participate in these ‘meetings.

If the administration is aware of the problems facing
college students, we just might be able to make a change
and perhaps even benefit from these necessary forums.

Saunders’ forums give students the opportunity to
speak to the people who can implement changes to

‘*'improve campus life and education.

T he‘ next SGB president is urged to continue these
meetings so that these networks can benefit us in the near
future. Although there has not been enough time since the
meeting for improvement, the mere fact that the
administration took the time to listen to students’ concerns
shows that progress has been made. ..

Communication between the Pitt adrr1inis_tration and
students must be a vital aspect of campus life if we would
like to see the end of the bureaucracy that is so prevalent
at Pitt. With the help of the students, the administration

§“inay be able to do so.

I am writing to address Dana Hamp’s letter in the
Oct. 22 edition of The Pitt News.

The claim is made that the Bible is interpreted
differently by all people and that Mr. Wenger
interpreted what the Bible says concerning
homosexuality in a way thatjustifies his own moral

disrespect toward portions of our population. Let’s
take aim now at: I

1) The Fighting Irish. The name suggests that
persons of Irish heritage are excessively bellicose.
2) The Saints. Patently offensive to Christians. -
3) The Padres. Insults priests, especially those of

code.
You are partly correct in stating
that the Bible is interpreted

Letters

Hispanic origin.
4) The Twins. Exploits the special

certain portions of the text, being rather cryptic in

nature, lend themselves quite nicely to that (certain

messianic prophecies for example). Nevertheless,
there are certain topics, homosexuality being one
of them, on which the Bible is very clear.
Consider Leviticus 18:22 or Corinthians 6:9-10.
Now you may say that I am doing what Mr. Wenger
has done. Howeverl challengeyou to find anything

' in the Bible which in one way or another addresses

homosexuality as anything but an infraction of _
God’s law. If you can do so, then you are correct.
I think you will soon realize that the Bible does not
leave much room for interpretation on this topic.
You don’t have to accept the Bible as true; you

have that freedom. However do not try to use the '
‘Bible as a basis for justifying a practice "it clearly

condemns. Any attempt to do so is really quite
foolish. 7

Freind an insult to Constitution

State Rep. Steven Freind, R—Del., is the most
dangerous type of person in the world. His opinions
and policies are an outrage and an insult to the
Constitution. (Don’t get me wrong; Arlen Specter
also has his drawbacks!) I hate to rehash an
overhashed subject but not supporting abortion

‘even when the mother’s life is threatened! What's

next —— taking away a woman's right to vote?
Further, Freind’s bigotry toward homosexuals is
outrageous. Do-we need to have homophobics in
the Senate? I don’t think so. (Ask anyone who’s

homosexual; it is not a choice.) Freind is simply an» i

insult to “people who have brains.” He is/a vivid
example of why we have to vote now. The events
that occur in our government today will affect us for
the rest of our lives. As for me, I’m writing in Peter

Golden girls promote stereotypes
How would you feel if you wanted to join a -Pitt-
sponsored activity and found out that you could

not be a part of it unless you weighed a certain

weight?
First, you might wonder why the University of

« Pittsburgh is still in the Middle Ages.

Second, you might wonder how a university can
get away with such horrible discrimination. '

Well, this is what the Golden Girls deal with
every day! These girls are not only judged on their
performance, but they are judged on their weight.
The Golden Girls are weighed according to height
and not fat-to—body content.

If they are even one pound over the limit, they
are not permitted to march, no matter how good
they look in their uniform. They are also weighed
in every day at practices.

The women are subjected to horrible eating
habits. Sometimes they do not eat the entire day
until weigh in. I

Constant weighing is a barbaric practice.

Not only is it demeaning, but {it is] discriminating.
Bulimia and anorexia can result from these unhealthy
weight limits and weighing practices.

The point is that I don’t want my_money that I pay
for tuition to go toward an organization that
promotes starvation and outdated stereotypes.

These women should be seen as having a
wonderful talent, not as women obsessed with
weight. '

, They were good enough to be on the squad
anyway, so why aren't they any good if they weigh
one pound over the limit’ ,  4

The Big East Championships has always
been a paradox for Pitt’s cross-country
teams. On one hand, the runners want to
perform well at their conference
championships. But on the other hand,
peaking too early could spell disaster for

' the regional and national meets.

What do you do? Compromise with
class. This past weekend the men’s and
women’s cross-country teams did just that
by placing fourth -and ﬁfth, respectively,
against the best teams in the country.

Leading the way for the women harriers
was Carmela Mariani with a 15th-place
finish. “I was happy with my performance,”
Mariani said. ‘‘I finished where I wanted to
be, despite the poor condition of the
course.”

Mariani should be happy. According to

Big East title with 19 points. Providence,
runners—up in the poll, finished with 55
points to narrowly hold off fourth—ranked
Georgetown’s bid for second. Boston
College, 19th in the ranking, beat out Pitt
by 32 points. ' _

Laura O’Donnell (22nd) followed
Mariani’s lead by improving on her 1990

Big East performance by 11 places. Stacey
Wzykowski held on for 40th place. Jen
Hrach finished in 54th place. Judy Facey
rounded out the top ﬁve with her 63rd
place. ,

Part of the men’s compromise involved
some performances that stood out and
some that were “okay.”

Standing out was Jason Bodnar. Known
for his roller—coaster consistency, Bodnar
finally put the mental and physical aspects
of good running together to finish fifth in

the five-mile run in 25:05. Prior to this ,

meet, Bodnar never broke the top 50.

Finishing in the top 10 and earningAll-
Big East status would make most runners
smile from ear to ear. But Mike Formica is
not an easy man to please.

Formica’s 1 ninth-place finish ‘in 25:22
was just “okay,” considering» his faster
1990 time of 24:56. But this performance
left him eager for the \upcoming

 

competitions. .

“I was really encouraged by the way
Brian [McCollough, 26th] and Frank [Nesko,
31st] ran,” Formica said. “I think if Steve
[Forrester, 53rd] runs healthy, we can beat
Vi1lanova.”

Villanova, ranked 21st in the latest
coaches’ poll, finished third with 91 points.
Georgetown ﬁnished second with a 62¢
point total. Fourth-ranked Providence won
the Big Easttitle with 34 points. Pitt totaled
108 points to finish fourth.

Finishing ahead of seventh man Steve
Forrester wasCr‘aig_Woshner’s 42nd placing
in 26:26 and Michael Lynn’s 44th—place
finish in 26:29.

.So with a performance that wasn’t earth-
shattering and one that was a total disaster,
Pitt’s cross-country teams are training
diligently for the IC4A Region
Championships to be held at Lehigh
University on Nov. 16.

Rowing club grabs 2 secorza’—places at Spea/emorz Regattai‘ 

By Bob Maselli

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Rowing Club traveled to
Columbus, Ohio, this past
weekend to compete in the
Speakmon Regatta and came
home with some well-deserved
medals from the varsity crews
and high hopes for the novice
teams.

The event, which showcased
25 clubs, including local rival
Duquesne University, Mercyhurst,
Ohio State, Wyandotte (Mich)

1 and Cincinnati, was a 1,500-meter

event. Each club raced

individually, and the clubs with
the best times went head to head
in a six-boat sprint race to find
the‘winner.

The club did well, bringing
back a second place medal in the
varsity men’s heavyweight event,
another second place in the varsity
women’s lightweight event and a
third-place medal in the varsity
men’s lightweight event.

The varsity men’s heavyweight
team of Leanna Hopkins, Matt
Prechtel, Peter Alpern, John
Dougherty and John Evans has
performed well together the past
two weekends. Two weeks ago
in the Head of Charles in Boston,

they qualified for the prestigious
event next year. The winning
club in the heavyweight race was
Cincinnati University.

The varsity women’s
lightweight team is made up of
George Collins, Jenifer Whitaker,
Marcy McCurdy, Lori Shofran and
Leslie Burchett, and the varsity
men’s lightweight team is made
up of Maria DePasquale, Bob
Falk, Graham Turnbull, Bert
Losken and Mike Kuchera.
Wyandotte grabbed the first-place
medal in the men’s lightweight
race, and Mercyhu rst took second
place.

Although the novice teams from

Pitt didn't bring home any medals
for their performances, they fared
well in their first regatta.

The ‘women’s novice team,
made up of Lorin Gaylord, Melissa
Fuller, Nancy Zebo,Jennifer Buck,
April Gearhart, Christine
Gerhardt, Melinda Mylet, Michelle
Zielinski and Coxswain George
Collins, qualified in the time trials
and made it to the finals. In the
final sprint event, the women
were leading with 100 meters to
go, but were disqualified.

The men’s novice eight-man
team, made up of Scott Wallace,
Ron Schmoll, Brad Gammons,
Steve Alves, Andy Paladino, Bob

Allen, Shawn Ellis, Stewart Wachs
and Coxswain Karen Rearick, took
a sixth—place finish in the event.
“We are happy with our
performance this weekend, and
the bottom line isbringing home
medals, and we did. We were
particularly impressed with our
novice racers,” said club president

‘and varsity lightweight man,

Graham Turnbull. “We are very
excited for them, and we can’t
wait until our next regatta.”

The next regatta for the Pitt
club is this weekend in Occoquan,
Va., in the “Head of Occoquan.”
All club members will be
competing in this event.

Running of Bulls to stampede rest of BAlCent1‘al I  

By Rob Z. Pugliese
Sta_[]“Writer

_ The Central Division is the most
uncertain muddle of teams, with
the two most drastic shakeups in
the league happening in Detroit
and Atlanta. In both cases, age
and experience have been
abandoned for the sake of
chemistry and the future. Still,
this division should occupy itself
from wire to wire looking up at
the 1991 NBA Champions and a
familiar pair of sneakers stenciled
with “23.”

Repeat? Well, the Chicago
Bulls are not overpowering
enough to immediately pencil in
as repeat champs, but the cast of
characters remains intact for
another year of the Chicago
Stadium Air Show. Last season’s
league and playoff Most Valuable
Player, Michael Jordan, has
dazzled the nation for seven years
and finally silenced the clamor
about him not being capable of
leading his team to a title. Jordan
dominated the league again,
averaging 31.5 points, while
leading Chicago to 61 victories.
Then he ﬁnally broke the shackles

of arch—rival Detroit in the Eastern '

Finals, before leading the Bulls to
a 4-1 roasting over Magicjohnson
and the Lakers in the finals. Jordan
also showed that he can indeed
elevate the games of marginal
players around him, such as John

Paxson, so there is absolutely"

nothing more for him to do except
run toward another title. Detroit
is the only team that has proven
it can control Jordan, so don’t
expect a sudden game—plan
change that might slow him.
Beating the Bulls isn’t a
question of stoppingjordan; he’ll
get his 30 or 35. Theman to

worry about is Scottie Pippen.
The high—flying Pippen
blossomed into the all-star the
Bulls’ brass expected last season,
scoring almost 18 points per game
while grabbing over seven boards
and really tightening up the
defensive reins. Pippen
performed much more
consistently than in previous
seasons, especially in big games.
He displayed a mental toughness
we haven’t seen before, and his
feud with Detroit’s Dennis
Rodman exploded in the playoffs,
actually raising Pippen’s game
another notch. But to truly be
considered a great small forward,
he needs to knock down the

‘jumper.

Power forward Horace Grant
(12.8pts., 8.4 rebs.) is the blue-
collar man. His Strengths are
quickness and offensive
rebounding. When Chicago goes
cold from the perimeter, Grant
always seems to be in position to
clean up the big rebounds and
get some easy baskets. An image
of a tired Grant at the foul line
with sweat dripping over his
protective goggles became more
frequent as the season wore on.
Paxson performed above his head
in series against Philly, Detroit,
and IA, and actually was one of
the big keys down the stretch.
Only a straight jump shooter,
Paxson’s game remains one-
dimensional. Center Bill
Cartwright played his finest
basketball in years down the
stretch. He provided needed
offense with his ugly, awkward
baseline jumper. Bench strength
is provided by the little sparkplug,
BJ. Armstrong, and jump-

_ shooting specialist Craig Hodges.

needs to happen /fast because
Cartwright is 34 and is susceptible
against top centers. —

They do have their share of
weaknesses, but Chicago should
win 60 again, and a second-
straight trip to the ﬁnals looks
good.

Last season’s playoff duel with
Boston was not a fluke, but the
dawning of a new contender in
the East as “The Riﬂeman,” Chuck
Person and the Indiana Pacers
took the Celtics to the limit. Pacer

fans have suffered for a long 1

time, but they will enjoy ’91—’92.
Person is an out-of—control
bomber who taunts, points
fingers, talks trash all night — and
backs up every word, You have
to enjoy his ﬂair and competitive
nature. Expect more nights like
the 39-point effort and two other
30+ games against Larry Bird and
the Celts for this marksman.
However he won’t gain any more
respect until he demonstrates the
ability to drive to the hoop or
excel in non-isolation sequences.
He doesn’t get to the foul line
often, less than three times per
game, and must pound the boards
harder (only 5.2). 0
Shooting guard Reggie Miller
has repeatedly shown that he's
one of the elite, if not the very
best, long-range bombers in the
game. But now Miller (22.6) goes
to the hole, hits “ﬂoaters” and has
improved his passing. He led the
entire league with 91.8 percent

So you think you
know everything
about contraception.
Have you heard
about film?

' VCF“ Vaginal Contraceptive
Film is recommended by
thousands of gynecologists
across the country. A micro-
thin square of VCF begins to
dissolve instantly, delivering an
effective dose of non-oxynol 9,
the non—hormonal spermicide
most recommended by
doctors. You (or he) won’t

from the line and hit 35 percent
of his 322 three—point attempts.
His one weakness is that he can
be taken down low and muscled
on the penetration. Look’ for a
monster season for Miller,
especially come May. Point man
Michael Williams is one of the
most underrated players in the
league. The lightning-quick
Williams took the reins injanuary
and ran the offense brilliantly,
racking up 15 points, close to
seven assists and three steals a
game. These figures would
escalate, but Williams is unselfish
and drives the Pacers’ machine at
breakneck speed, then gets the
ball to the open man. Six-foot
ﬁve—inch Vern Fleming completes
the devastating backcourt trio with
solid transition play and excellent
rebounding. Fleming is excellent ‘

when taking a smaller guard
inside. ‘
Power forward Detlefschrempf
(16.1, 8.0) won the league’s
honors as the top sixth man.
Athletic and very powerful,

Schrempf provides a difficult ,

matchu p for most opponents. The
main weakness that will hold
Indiana back is the soft middle.
Rik Smits is an underachiever,
and Greg Dreiling is a stiff. They
feel that powerful rookie forward
Dale Davis of Clemson will take
on a great deal of the rebounding
load and intimidate with his shot-
blocking. All in all, this is a
dangerous club that will win 50,
nudge Detroit, at the end for
second and advance to the Eastern
Semis.
You’re definitely going to need.

a scorecard if you plan to watch the

. ‘Detroit Pistons this season.

The dethroned Bad Boys underwent a
drastic makeover in an effort to add speed
and offensive punch to a plodding,
sputtering attack. Yes, despite endless
speculation, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars,

I ' Dennis Rodman and Bill Laimbeer are still

here, but a slow start could change that.
The breakup of the old champs began
when 36-year-old center, James Edwards,
and his fallaway jumper were shipped to
the Los-Angeles Clippers for shooting
guard Jeff Martin, a prospect with range
and quick feet. Scott Hastings, another

member of Detroit’s 30—and—over club,
was sent with a draft choice to Denver for
the smooth but selﬁsh Orlando Woolridge.
The Pistons then raised a few eyebrows by
not trading but waiving “the Microwave”
Vinnie Johnson, a man who carried them
offensively through the playoffs during
their banner years (15.2 last season) but
who, at 35, the Pistons deemed expendable.
They signed free-agent seven-footer Brad
Sellers from Europe and, in the biggest
move, acquired versatile guard Darrell
Walker from Washington for second-round
picks in ’92 and ’93.

All of these moves leave Detroit with a
quicker, more athletic offensive group

that can still D it up with anybody. Those
who suggest a sharp decline in Motown
may be correct in the near future, but not
this year. Granted, even with the makeover,
Chuck Daly’s gang is still aging faster than
any other club, but their heart and soul
will hold together for one more run.
Thomas is unquestionably the leader.
The Pistons do as he does and play like
him: ruthless, feisty and determined. At
30, he’s.lost a step due to injuries, but he
still buries the rainbows off Laimbeer's
picks and penetrates better than 80 percent
of the other lead_ guards. Thomas and
partner Dumars play some of the nastiest,
in-your-face defense of any tandem.

A Dumars is the offensive catalyst. He

pumped in over 20 per contest and shows
creative playmaking skills as well,
evidenced by his stint at the point while
Thomas healed. This could be Laimbeer’_s
last hurrah. His play has fallen off severely
(11.0, 48%FG), and injuries have taken
their toll much more than anybody
suspected. Once a feared defender,
Laimbeer can be shoved around and is
vulnerable to foul problems. Offensively,
if his jumper’s not falling, forget him. He’s
too slow.

Rodman won the NBA’s Defensive Player

'6“.

Hackett said Seaman is having
his finest season at tight end
while also handling the leadership
role excellently. He is more
confident, playing much better
and has become stronger and
quicker than he was last season,
according to Hackett.

“He has handled [team captain]

Hackett said when he came to
Pitt his first impressions of Seaman
were “a good blocker and a
limited receiver.” But this season
Seaman, along with tight end
Dave Moore, is among the top
five receivers in the Big East.

“[Our] tight ends are usually
the hot receivers,” Seaman said.
“Alex is going to the tight ends or
the backs out of the backﬁeld
[because] we’ve gotten a lot of
blitzes this year. A lot of teams
are coming after us and trying to
get to Alex quick, so he doesn’t
have time. It just worked out that
the [tight ends] have been the

' guys he’s been going to

underneath the deep patterns. A
lot of teams have been playing us

. with deep coverage.”

Seaman and Moore compliment
each other “magnificently,”
according to Hackett. Seaman is
a stronger blocker, while Moore
is a stronger receiver, but this
season both players have
improved on their weaker points.

Seaman came to P-itt in 1987 as
an offensive guard. He was
recruited heavily by top college
programs such as Notre Dame,
Penn State and Syracuse.

Seaman said that even though
his father played for Pitt in the
late 1950s, it didn’t really affect

“My father never once said to
me, ‘You’re going to Pitt.’ Never,”
Seaman said. “I thought about
the fact that my father came here,
but it really didn’t make a
difference. It’s a decision I made
on my own. But he’s happy with
it; I know that.

“Pitt has always had the greatest A

V and could be the best defender

ever. At 6-8 he plays inJorda_n or
Barkley’s face one night and then
frustrates larger opponents like
Robert Parish the next. He also
led the league in offensive
rebounds and ﬁnished second to
David Robinson with 12.5 overall.
With Rodman and newly acquired
Walker, Detroit could have the
two bestdefenders in the league.

Even with Mark Aguirre (14.2)
and Woolridge (25.1) bombing,
the Pistons won’t have enough

,_ offensive continuity to play

consistently for 82 games.
Chemistry could be a problem,

. but Daly and Isiah will hold the

Pistons together for 48 or 49
wins. A first-round playoff exit is
likely.

/ The Cleveland Cavaliers are
ready to celebrate New Year’s
Day 1992 already. January is the
target date for the return of all-
star point guard/choirboy Mark
Price. Every year the Cavs plan
and shape what looks like a
potential championship club, but
bad luck finds Cleveland every
time. Only in ’88—89, when the
Cavs posted 57 wins, did the
team enjoy an injury-free season.
Two years ago injuries hit Brad
Daugherty, Larry Nance andjohn
“Hot Rod" Williams, among
others. But when healthy,
Cleveland looked awesome.’ Last
season, after just 16 games, Price
suffered a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his knee, and the

Cavaliers struggled miserably‘

without’ him. If he returns to
form, Price has one of the most
complete games of any point
guard, with a nice jumper, great
range (41.8% career 3-pters.) and
exceptional driving ability. His
backcourt mate will be either
rookie ace Terrell Brandon from
Oregon or free-agentJohn Battle,
signed from rival Atlanta. Battle
(13.6) is a proven outside scorer,

but he suffered a knee injury in
camp that will sideline him for
another; two or three weeks
minimum, so Brandon will have
his chance early. Despite
tremendous all-around skills,
Brandon won’t have the impact
that the Cavs want at off-guard
because he is only 5-11 and could
ﬂourish instead as a backup to
Price.

The frontcourt is solid. Seven-
foot center Daugherty (21.6, 10.9)
is the most versatile big man in
the NBA. A dominant low-post
scorer, Daugherty also dished out
253 assists and toasted defenders
with a soft jump hook and tough
face-up jumper. He’s a bit slow
but has too much ammunition for
that to hurt him. Save Ewing,
Robinson and Olajuwon,
Daugherty’s finer than any center
in the NBA and will be scary as he
gets better. Nance, Williams and
first-year flop Danny Ferry are
the keys here. If these forwards
gel into a solid rotation that
actually earns their megamillions,
watch out. They are as tall and
versatile as anyone. But there are
too many questions with the point
position until Price returns.
Stopgap performers Darnell
Valentine and John Morton will
struggle for the first two months,
and the Cavs will have to dig
themselves from a major hole.

Daugherty’s presence alone
makes Cleveland a playoff team,
good for 40 to 42 wins, and a
prime upset threat in the first
round

,C.,0..a1.<:h. 13.0.13. Weiss has ripped

apart theAtlanta Hawks from the
inside and given them a youthful,
balanced look, built for his motion
offense. There are two constants:
six—time all-star Dominique

V Wilkins and power forward Kevin

Willis (13.1, 8.8). ‘Nique is now
31 and has been one of the most
dominating and spectacular
players in the game for9 seasons.

A slam-dunk champion and
unstoppable scorer, Wilkins
pumped in 26 points per contest.

He had maybe his finest all-
around season with a career-high
nine rebound average and
actually made a strong run at the
MVP. He has an amazing first
step on the baseline and athletic
spin moves to complement his
acrobatic drives and steady
jumper. Wilkins works harder
every year and seems determined
to reach his goal of a double-
figure rebounding average. Early
in his career, many thought he
would be a one-dimensional
player, but Wilkins has been one
of the fiercest competitors and
still wants an NBA title. The closest
he and his Hawks came was

1988, when Boston edged them ‘

in Game 7 of the Eastern Finals.

Since then the Hawks have
wasted talent, lacked chemistry
and frustrated their coaches, fans
and themselves. Rebuilding is
now at hand. The backcourt will
consist of second-year players
Rumeal Robinson at point guard
and newly acquired gunner Travis
Mays at shooting guard. There’s

no doubting their talent, but

inexperience will make this a
painful learning season. Atlanta
realizes this and recently traded
Tim McCormick to the Knicks for
13-year veteran Maurice Cheeks.
Despite the age factor, Cheeks
ranked fourth in the league in
assist-to-turnover ratio and can
teach Robinson a thing or two

about running a club and playing \

a little 11 His inﬂuence may speed
the learning process. Mays
improved as his rookie year in
Sacramento wore on, averaging
over 14 points per game and
drilling 36 percent of his treys. He
plays both ends and should fit
perfectly into this passing offense.
He’ll be boosted by the depth of
rookie Rodney “Ice” Monroe of
NC State, who should also receive

significant time. Robinson needs
more confidence.

He and Wilkins didn’t get along
very well last season, but
Dominique is trying to smooth

-things out. Who knows what

Robinson is thinking by
threatening not to give Wilkins
the ball?

The Hawks have an outstanding
athlete and defender in rookie
swingman Stacey Augmon, who
should lend much-needed
toughness and leadership to this
crew. Up front, the seven-foot
Willis remains an enigma. He has
a world of talent but often
disappears in games and lacks
maturity and an understanding of
his role. He and Wilkins must
carry this young group and be
patient with their mistakes if they
hope to return to the playoffs
next season. Not this season. For
‘Nique, time is running out.

Moses Malone won’t take the
Milwaukee Bucks to the
promised land. In fact, they might
not even make the playoffs. They
were one of the league‘s big

e surprises last season, but a

disappointing first-round exit in
the postseason forced Coach Del
Harris to obtain a low-post scorin g
threat to complement the Bucks’
solid perimeter attack. Malone
was the best Milwaukee could
do. At age 36, Moses had some
success in a reserve role for Atlanta
last season with 10.6 points and
8.1 boards, but he won’t have a

‘ big impact here. Yes, he’ll pound

the boards on a team desperate
for rebounding, but the Bucks
plan on starting him ahead of
Danny Schayes, and they’1lsoon
find out that he’ll clog the flow of
their smooth passing offense and
probably frustrate guards Jay
Humphries and Alvin Robertson
by never kicking the ball back
out. Humphries and Robertson
mightbe the best all-around
tandem in the league and will be

backed by instant offense in D_ale
Ellis (16.8). This backcourt isn’t
flashy, but it is deliberate and
frustrating for opponents.
Robertson led the league in steals
for the third time in his seven-
year career, with over three per
contest.

No team is more disciplined or
works harder than Milwaukee,
but lack of rebounding and
athleticism means no postseason
berth. ,

Ex-General Manager and
spanking new head coach Allan
Bristow is sweating. In fact, panic
time is here. Only three days until
tip-off, and the Charlotte
Hornets have yet to reach an
agreement with who they feel
will be their franchise player,

H)‘

UNLV’s Larry Johnson. The first '

selection from June’s draft,
Johnson rejected the latest
Hornets’ offer, which is believed
to include $15.5 million over a
five—yearspan. Johnson holds fast
to his demands for over four
million per season. The reviews
for L.J. are mixed. His doubters
say that at 6-5 and 250, he doesn't
yet possess the necessary jump-
shooting range or ballhandling
skills to dominate on the inside.
His fans say Johnson could be
another Charles Barkley and
overcome his size with these traits:
quickness and agility with
overpowering strength and post
moves, a nose for the boards, a
competitive mean streak, a
massive physique and great
leadership. I think Johnson falls
somewhere in between, but he
will definitely be a superstar in
this league sooner rather than
later.

Johnson ‘cannot be
underestimated by size because
his work ethic, heart and desire
are undeniable. This man has
been a big winner at every level
of hoops and at UNLV took his
game a notch higher when
confronted with tough
competition. Like a Barkley or
Karl Malone, you sawJohnson as
a man among boys. Bristow calls
Johnson the “stinger” the Hornets
need. They lacked toughness last
season and will again if L.J. doesn’t
sign.

For the time being, Charlotte
will ride’ on one of the league’s
most exciting young backcourts.
Its best player is dynamic point
guard Kendall Gill, an all-rookie
pick last season.

Gill and off—guard Rex
Chapman are both devastating,

open-court players who can drive‘;
dunk on anybody, pull up and 

drill a long‘-range jumper. Gill
also plays mean defense, the one
thing Chapman needs to reach
an all-star level. They will be
awesome in a year or two. Small
forward Johnny Newman (16.9)
is all offense, not much
rebounding and limited defense.
But J.R. Reid and Johnson will
clean glass and toughen the
inside. At center, Mike Gminski is
reaching the end of the line
quickly. Next move for Charlotte:
Draft a center. Charlotte won 26

games last year but has great"-«*

talent, and ifJohnson arrives soon,
Charlotte will be exciting and
much improved. However the
Hornets are still a couple players
away from playoff caliber.
