Business Bureau
Head Receives

Government Job

By Irving Kaufman

Application for an 18 months’
leave of absence, to become ef-
fective at the beginning of the
year, has been made by Dr. Ralph
J. VVatkins, director of the Bu-
reau of Business Research, who
was recently appointed assistant di-
rector of the wage-hours standards
division of the Wage-Hour Law.

Rumors of his application for leave
were conﬁrmed by Dr. Watkins, who
is in town for the week-end.

According to Dr. Watkins, until
January 1, he will continue “direct-
ing a study of energy resources for
the Nation’s Resources Committee.”
He will also continue as head of the
Bureau of Business Research, until
that date, he announced.

Discussing the “leak” in downtown
papers concerning his appointment,
Dr. Watkins revealed that originally
it had been planned to withhold
knowledge of his appointment until
He said
that prior to‘ the break of the story
he had had conferences with admin-
istration officials concerning the leave
of absence.

Revelation by downtown papers of
his appointment made it necessary
for Washington to conﬁrm his new
position before his leave had been
deﬁnitely granted.

However, Dr. Watkins said that he
expects no difficulty in having his
leave granted.

Dr. Watkins’ appointment will
place him in charge of the Wage and
Hours standards branch, a unit
“which is concerned with the work
of the industrial committee set up
under the act.”

On these industrial committees
will be represntatives of employers,
employees, and of the public.

According to Dr. Watkins, func-
tions of the committee will be to es-
tablish the most beneﬁcial conditions
for each industry and group of in-
dustries. The problem is “to work
out these standards on a cooperative
basis.”

Dr. Watkins stressed the coopera-
tive factor. He said Mr. Andrews,
the administrator, would make “no
efforts to ‘crack down,’ and that care
is being taken to put the law into
effect slowly.”

Reaction thus far shows that the
American public will give the new
law time to show its effect, Dr. Wat-
kins pointed out.

Applicants Interviewed

YWCA to Visit E

Planned Towns

Next Saturday

Planned to follow up the infor-
mation that Wallace Richards will
present today at Inquiry Forum, the
Public Agairs committee of the
YWCA will conduct a trip on Satur-
day to two planned towns in West-
ern Pennsylvania.

First stop will be the Westmore-
land homesteads, located near
Greensburg. This project is spon-
sored by the government. After in-
specting this site, the group will
move on to the Penn-Craft settle-
ment near Brownsville. This is a
miners’ cooperative town managed
independently of the government. At
each town an authority will speak on
the project.

Places of historical interest in these
localities will be included in the trip.

All students and? faculty members
are invited to take this trip. The
only cost will be a slight charge for
gasoline and lunch. The group will
meet at 8:45 o’clock at the Fifth ave-
nue entrance of the Cathedral. Those
interested may sign up on the bulle-

Miss Blatt to Head Sixth Annual

ICC Conference

at Harrisburg

Invitations to the fifth annual In-9

tercollegiate Conference on Govern-
ment in Harrisburg will go out to-
day, announced Miss Genevieve
Blatt, C33, former director of Wo-
men's Debating and present execu-
tive director of ICG, from the civil
service desk in the City-County
building.

Announcing that the ICG confer-
ence in April will be a model uni-
cameral legislature, Miss Blatt went
on to say that an executive commit-
tee will draw up the agenda for the
conference at a meeting in January.

Founded in 1934 by Miss Blatt and
John Bracken, C34, as a chance for
student participation in government”
the conferences sprouted from this,
embryo of students into an activity’
which drew nearly 400 delegates_
from colleges and universities ini
Pennsylvania at last year’s modeli
governor’s conference. ,

With the Nebraska unicameral ex- 5
periment in mind, the legislators of.
sixth conference will attempt to pass E
bills most worthwhile for their con-
stituencies.

Miss Blatt declared that
this conference brings out the origin-
al purpose of the organization,

the 
to 
foster an interest in governmental.’

problems among students in colleges
and universities by dramatizing the
activities of the government in a
nonpartisan manner.

‘This is the third legislative confer-
ence of the organization, according
to Miss Blatt. For the years of the
regular meetings of the General As-
sembly, the Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on Government presents legisla-
tive sessions. In between these
years, the ICG sponsors other forms
of governmental action.

In 1934, the model constitutional
convention was held; in 1936, the
presidential year, a model party
convention assembled; and in 1938,
matching Governor Earle’s commit-
tee, a governors’ conference met.

“ICG could be a major activity on
the University campus if the stu-
dents wanted it,” says Miss Blatt.
"Temple University is the best ex-
ample of all-year-dound ICG work;
a club has ben formd and extra-
curricular classes are held by the
political science department.”

Miss Blatt left the single thought
with the delegates from the Univer-
sity that the action on campus must
come from within; the movement
must be supported by the group most
interested in government.

Aptitude Tests

Medical Aptitude Tests, a normal
requirement for admission to any
School of Medicine, will be given to
pre-medical students at 3:30 o’clock,
December 2, in 132 Cathedral.

Requiring approximately two
hours, the examination, taken last
year by 242 students of the College,
measures the general information
and scientiﬁc background of the stu-
dent.

In former years supplementary
tests have been given in the spring,
but this year, it has been announced,
only one test will be given.

All students who will have com-
pleted the pre-medical requirements
in time for admission to the School
of Medicine in the fall of 1939 are
required to take the examination.

A fee of one dollar, payable at the
treasurer’s office, 7 State Hall in
advance of the test, is required of
each applicant.

Identity of the magician will be a

Held under the sponsorship of the
Housing Board of WSGA, Tuesday’s
party will consist of games that will
help all the women become acquaint-
ed with each other.

Refreshments will include pie, cof-
fee, and ice cream. Patsy Grifﬁth,
C40, chairman in charge of the ef-
fair, urges communters and out-of-
town women to attend.

Wednesday

Football Mentor
During Assembly

With the dual purpose of both hon-
oring Dr. John B. Sutherland and of
spiriting the Pitt football team for
its ﬁnal game with Duke, a huge SFA
pep rally will be held in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial hall on Wed-
nesday afternoon at 2 o’clock.

At this time the petition. express-
ing student appreciation of the ex-
ceptional service Dr. Sutherland has:

rendered to the University will be
presented to the Pitt football coach.

After tabulating the results of Fri-
day’s circulation, it was found that
2,300 signatures had been attached!
to the laudation petition. Names are I
still being added, and it is expected
that at the completion of today’s ac-
tivity every student in the Univer-
sity will have signed.

According to Leonard Levison, C39,
SFA pep committee chairman, the ;
program at this meeting will be fea-_|
tured by student speakers. John ,
Downie, BA39, president of SFA, and
William Sterling, C39, president of
Interfraternity Council will be among l
the speakers.

The reason for the use of student
speakers is that the assembly is tol
be a student expression to Dr. Suth- ’
erland. .

It is also to serve as in pepping the
Panthers for their Saturday afternoon
in Durham, North Carolina, when §
they meet a formidable Duke team,
which ranks as one of the best in the
nation. I

This pep meeting will be the fourth |
of the year sponsored by SFA. A .

pected to be the biggest one yet to
be held.

‘A Dedication
‘Points A Need

W l.'l‘l*I the dedication of Heinz Cliapel yes-te‘rid"y,
a new addition has officially taken its place in
the 1*‘rick Acres building plan.

An impressive building, it was dedicated? with
iinprossivo. though simple cereinonies. Impressive,
too. were the rcniarks made in the dedicaet-.ory
services.

From the zicldress of prosentatioii made by Mr:
Ho ’i‘.l'(l llcinz. we particularly noted the object of
p1‘93Clllllf_I,‘ “a gospel so iiitellcctiially honest él'l1ll(’l
so ixiorzilly courageoiis, so harinonious with the best
of life as to send them forth who worship here
with that understaiiiliiig which makes men greatly
obedient to the laws that govern their lives.”

That's what‘ we would call “saying a niouthful.”
It is a big ordci', which, it carried out to the letter
would doubtless be in keeping with the best idealls
of any University.

But the test will come with the building’s us.-e.-
“And we hope that use, in keeping with these high
ideals, will be made freely available to all Uni-
versity students. '

The chapel will, to some extent, supplement the
Stephen F-ostcr Memorial which has provided a
rather limited outlet for some few University
activities. ‘

'l‘hese. additions to the building program, how-
eife1', by theinselves are quite inadequate to ﬁll the
social and intellectual needs of students. The only
answer we can see is one that has already been
recognized in most universities—a student union
building, where the extra-class life of the students
may be conveiiiently and adequately concentrated.

Until such a step is taken. the University build-
ing plan must continue to be regarded as far from
complete. ' -

C is doing such a magniﬁcant job of getting the German
people and the whole world ready for war, his attention
should be called to it.

For the fact is, Herr Goebbels does not know a
dammed thing about music. He committeed an un-
pardonable error in allowing some movements from
Beethoven’s third symphony—the Eroica—during the
‘funeral of the German diplomat murdered in Paris
: by a young Polish Jew.

l
i Beethoven Not German

In the ﬁrst place, Beethoven was not a German, but
a dumpy little Dutchman who happened to be born
just inside the border of Germany. His ancestry is
unmistakably Dutch.

This can be overlooked. But this particular sym-
phony has a bitterly personal story behind it, and Mr.
Goebbels, even with his encyclopedic mind and earnest
desire to always present the facts clearly and accurate-
ly in the best newspaper tradition was not acquainted
with it or he would never have allowed this work to
be played.

In his younger days, Beethoven was pretty much of
a radical. He hated the realpolitick which he believed
was eating like a cancer into Prussian economic and
cultural life. Consequently, he developed a strong ad-
miration for a little Corsican, Napoleon Bonaparte by
name, who seemed to him to represent the best ele-
ments surviving from the bloody days of the French
Revolution.

Eroica For Independence *

Beethoven composed the Eroica symphony in
1805 to express his admiration for Napoleon, who
represented the ideal of independence and individual-
ity that he loved. Finally the work was completed,
ailid the title page stated that the symphony was ded-
icated to Napoleon Bonaparte.

And then Beethoven learned that Napoleon had set
himself up as the Dictator of the French Nation. It
shattered everything. The little composer ripped up
the title page, and when the Eroica symphony was
published, it announced that the music was composed
to “honor the memory of a great man.” The second
movement is a funeral march—fcr the Napoleon that
Beethoven loved had ceased to exist.

So, it is somewhat surprising, and very amusing to
read that Mr. Hitler sat complacentlylistening to the
strains of the “Heroic” symphony, written by a com-
posere who was a pure German racially and culturally.

Of course, Mr. Goebbels can retore by saying that he
can throw Beethoven by the boards just as he has with
Mendelssohn. Mr. Goebbels still has Wagner, a good
Jew-hater. I

New German Anthem

Musicologlsts have been investigating, and they are
not certain whether or not Wagner had Jewish blood
in his veins. If this is conclusively proven, the Germans
are going to be without any music before a very long
time has passed.

And so I make a suggestion. 'Why not take some
good American swing music. There is a ﬁne piece
that would be excellent for the German storm troop-
ers to goose step to, and it would also ﬂatter the ego
of Mr. Hitler, who has been very saddened to learn
of the distaste with which peoples‘ of other countries
regard him.

I suggest as the new German n'ati‘on‘al anthem, “Sa-
tan Takes a Holiday.”

Fashion Experts
Answer Student
Style Problems

By Alice Benovitz

Using a new fashion approach, The
Pitt News came through with a big-
ger and better style show than ever
before. This year, a campus commit-
tee consisting of Kal Kalwary, Tom
Smith, Pat Franklin, and Patsy Grif-
ﬁth collected clothes problems of the
student body and submitted them to
the fashion experts at Rosenbaum’s.

Mrs. Charles Ruch, of the Retail
Research Bureau, stated the ﬁrst
problem as the mid—season blues, or,
to state it differently, the lull in the
coed’s wardrobe. One of the most
eﬁective picker uppers was a white
Tyrolean sweater modeled by Jane
Bell. The bright red embroidery and
the moss green skirt added the note
of color.

Sport Outﬁts

As a result of the tremendous
amount of publicity given to skiing
and skating this year, sport outﬁts
are of top importance. They range
from extremely brief skating skirts of
wine velveteen and aqua-blue to
bulky but tailored ski pants. Inci-
dentally, those who realize their lim-
itations in the matter of legs would
do much better in skiing clothes.
(Just a hint to the wise.)

An important fashion item was the
pink angora sweater modeled by Ann
Seaman. For the ﬁrst time one sees
dressy sweaters everywhere from
school to the Chatterbox. In fact,
Paris is sponsoring sweater tops on
evening gowns.

As the answer to the coed’s need
for something dressy and yet sporty,
Rosenbaum’s offers the ever popular
wools in all shades. An extremely
practical outﬁt was the slate blue
wrinkle-shedding gaberdine worn by
Mary Kate McMaste1‘s.

While black, as always, is still the
choice of the best-dressed women, a
great number of college women will
wear the more youthful color com-
binations of wine and blue, honey
beige” and rust, and apricot and
brown.

football team, which rightfully ranks as one of the nation ’s greatest, 3

had Marshall Goldberg at ful1back¢

for the ﬁrst time in two weeks andi
it looked every bit the part of a na-
tional championship caliber team.

SENIORS BOWL
Penn State was on hand to renew
a gridiron friendship that extends as

far back in the years as Pitt foot-
ball goes. With such good friends
around, it was appropriate that the
class of ’39 should give so ardent a
football farewell to the folks at home.

Every senior was given the chance

Panther scoring unit, featuring one of
its two underclassmen, Dick Cassi-
ano, went around the Lion ends for
26 points while the boys from up
state were unable to come near the
Panther goal line.

The return to the Pitt line-up of
fullback Goldberg meant the return
of precise, spirited, unstoppable Pitt.
After a serious of judicial errors, oc-
cassioned by rather mediocre of-
ficiating, the Panthers began to roll.

One break after another kept the
Panthers from settling down to the
business of gathering in some points
in the beginning of the game. Fin-
ally, after considerable maneuvering,
Pitt obtained the ball on the State
47-yard line where Ickes, no New
Dealer, fumbled.

‘Four plays later the Panther had
their ﬁrst touchdown. Dick Cassi-
-ano, who hardly knows what it is
‘to be downed, ran around left end‘
for 26 yards. Stebbins tried the
other side on a reverse that went
for no gain.

CASSIANO CARRIES

Then Chick decided that the most
‘propitious thing to do was to keep
putting the ball in Cassiano’s hands
and let the Phi Kap scholar keep
bouncing his way around left end.

This strategy required two more
plays for a touchdown. First, Dick
went for ﬁve yards, then he jitter-
bugged for 17 more yards to dip
across the goal line standing up. Bill
Daddio kept his kicking true to ﬁnish
up the Panthers’ first period scoring,
‘7-0.

The second period found the Pitt
second team remaining on a little
more than equal terms with the Hig-
gins clan.

When the ﬁrst team seniors re-
turned to the play in the second half
they proceeded to go about clearing

up speculation concerning the ulti-
mate result.

Goldberg, apparently overjoyed to
get his hands on the ball, snatched
the kick-off, and thundered up the
'ight side of the ﬁeld. He started on
his own three and was stopped by the
last Penn State man, Ickes on the
Lion 44-yard line.

CASSIANO SCORES

Goldberg was unable to pass the
last man for a combination of rea-
sons. First, his knee was so thor-
oughly bandaged that it was a won-
der he could run. Anyway, it pre-
vented him from cutting as he
normally would. Second, he slipped
on the wet turf. And, third, Ickes
wiggled out of Bob Dannies’ block.

From this point, Pitt’s half-back
carriers, Stebbins and Cassiano, took
the Panthers very rapidly down the
ﬁeld. Cassiano, on the same kind
of runs he used to score against Ford-
ham and also to score the ﬁrst touch-
down of this game, ﬁnished up the
last 19 yards. Daddio offered the
extra point to bring the score 14-O.

Little time elapsed between this
score and the next Pitt point-mak-
ing. Ickes fumbled again, this time
on the ﬁrst play following the kick-
off and on the State 33-yard point.

Cassiano, thoroughly familiarized
with the routine, went after the
touchdown. After this, the regulars
left the Stadium playing ﬁeld for
the last time.

LEZOUSKI OUT

Catching the spirit of things, the
second team came through with a
touchdown itself. It happened in
the fourth quarter" when the gates
were opened by another Lion funi-
ble. This one, by Rollins, was on
the Penn State 22. Naric, Peace,
and Thurbon did the ground-gain-
ing until Bobby Thurbon cut off
tackle into the end-zone.

About the only not of discontent
that came out of this game turned
up in the locker-room when it was
found that Al Lezouski sustained a
rather severe injury. It is believed
that the senior Panther guard has
a torn cartiledge in his knee.

If this is the case he will be un-
able to participate in the all-import-
ant game with unscored-upon, un-
beaten Duke in Durham, North Car-
olina this coming Saturday. '

members.

Phi Delta Theta has come up like
a whirlwind through the losers brack-
et after losing an early game. Since
then they have been undefeated and
have beaten the Metallurgists in the
single time that they have met. That
defeat is the lone blot on the En-
gineer’s records.

If the Phi Deltas subdue the Metal-
lurgists today, the trophy will go to

Metallurgists will necessitate a ﬁnal

afternoon’s game. “We have the

stuif to win and, with every good
break, there should be no question
as to the result of this get-together.”

There is more than a little sub-
stantial background to Cashdollar’s
observation. The Mets and the Phi
Delts have met before on the ﬁeld of
gridiron battle. The meeting was
held last Wednesday at which time
the Phi Delts established themselves
as well-founded favorites by passing
out a 13-7 victory over the repre-
sentatives of the Engineering school.

Also, there is the fact that, in
winning the Interfraternity toga, the
Dithridge street fence-painters turn-
ed back the most select group of
competition. The two tilts with Phi
Gamma Delta were touch—football
masterpieces, with the Phi Delts
coming out with the best piece, of
course. A

Dutton, Jones, Ross, and Murphy
pranced up and down the wet ﬁeld
with sureness in their scoring steps.
They wasted no time at all in piling
up a score. V

In the first period they pushed over

two touchdowns. An extra point
conversion added to this gave them
a halftime lead of 13 points.
Dutton, playing right halfback,

piece of -excitement.

The day’s other long jaunt was
turned in by young Randour, a re-
placement for Jones, who scampered
40 yards from scrimmage to score.

Edgar Jones accounted for two
touchdowns and Ross made the other
one to complete the Panther scoring.
The Panthers made 10 first downs to
Kiski’s 4.

This completed the regular sched- »

Phi Epsilon Pi each placed one man.

Heading the list of outstanding in-
dividuals is Ray Dimit, Phi Gamma
Delta athletic director. Ray is the
chief reason for the Phi Gam winning
streak which took them to the ﬁnals.
His passing, blocking, and line play
on the defense place him above all
others as a triple threat. Due to the
presence of so many excellent backs,
Ray is placed at tackle, and captains
the team.

PASS RECEIVER

Larry Smith, Phi Delta Theta, and
Bob Jones of Delta Tau Delta are the
two ends. Smitty and Jones are both
above par as defensive players, and
are clever pass receivers, having the
knack of tricking opposing backﬁeld

men out of position on the offense.
Harry Holt, Delta Tau Delta end,
is placed at the other tackle opposite
Dimit. Harry is a hard charger, a
difficult man to take out on the de-
fense, a good blocker and pass re-
ceiver on the offense, and he spends
his spare time place-kicking for the
‘Delts.

.Jack Eitel of Phi, Gamma Delta
rates the center position. However,
Snyder of Phi Delta Theta, Gregory
of Delta Tau Delta, and Hershman of
Pi Lambda Phi all -have shown well
at this position. Jack’s passing at
center has been perfect, and as rover

«on the defense, he has had few
passes completed in his territory. -
Selecting the backﬁeld this year is
quite a laborious task. The four out-
standing men, as viewed by their op-
ponents, are George Davies of Pi
Kappa Alpha, Larry Katz of Pi
Lambda Phi, Paul Park of Phi Delta
' Theta, and Wallace Hirsch of Phi Ep-
. silon Pi.

Other outstanding backs are Bernie

Cashdollar, Phi Delta Theta; Cooper Theta, left half; Cooper, Delta Tau
Delta, right half; and Tom I-Ialloran,

and Stickle, Delta Tau Delta; Lynch,
Lambda Chi Alpha; Halloran, Phi

I Phi Kappa, fullback.

‘George Davies receives the posi-
tion of ﬁeld general in the ﬁrst team
backﬁeld. He is an able passer, re-

ceiver, and a good selector of plays. O

Larry Katz is placed at left half.
Larry IS the leading scorer in the
Interfraternity League due to his

_speed in outrunning the opposing

secondary to snag passes. His punt-
ing has been consistent and he is an
efficient safety man.

Right halfback position is given to
Wally Hirsch, southpaw passing ace.
Wally is a holdover from last year’
All Fraternity team. ‘

Paul Park is assigned the fullback
slot. Pee Wee is the Phi Delt all-
round man. He passes, runs, calls
plays and blocks in good fashion.
Paul has been the most consistent
back in the league this year.

The second team consists of Bob
Goleman, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Bill
Edmunds, Phi Gamma Delta, at ends.
Goleman is a good pass receiver and
a capable defensive end. Edmunds
has been playing regularly in the
backﬁeld but his pass receiving rates
him an end position.

ANGEL AT TACKLE

Brown of Lambda Chi Alpha and
Angel of Phi Delta Theta are listed
as tackles. Both are tough defensive
players. Hershman of Pi Lambda

rushing on defense and blocking on

Heinz Dedicates Chapel
To Father, Grandmother

Dr. Coffin Delivers
Principal Address
At Sunday Services

Dedicating a memorial to the
concepts of religion a11d of educa-
tion revered by their father, the
children of the late H. J. Heinz
presented the Heinz Memorial
Chapel to the L'niversity, through
Howard Heinz, in a special dedica-
tion yesterday afternoon.

In behalf of Mrs. John Given, the
late Clifford Heinz, and himself, Mr.
Heinz presented the chapel in mem-
ory of his father and grandmother,
Anna Margaretta Heinz, “as part of
the University . . . dedicated . . .
to culture, understanding, response
to beauty, and religious worship.”

COFFIN SPEAKS

Principal speaker at the dedication
was Dr. Henry Sloane Coﬂin, presi-
dent of the Union Theological semi-
nary, who described the correlation
of religion and democracy as seen by
H. J. Heinz.

Other speakers included Dr. Stuart
Nye Hutchison, pastor of the East
Liberty Presbyterian church, who
presented the scripture lesson, and
Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, Shadyside
Presbyterian church, who read the
“oﬂice of dedication” and led the
prayer.

Mr. Heinz paid tribute to the late
Charles Z. Klauder, designer of the
chapel. In passing he also expressed
appreciation to all who worked on
the building. “Each one wanted his
work to be his masterpiece,” Heinz
said. “Even the night watchman was
as proud of what he called ‘my
chapel’ as the artist who made the
designs and models.”

SERVES RELIGIOUS NEEDS

A chapel to serve the religious need
of the students was the object of the
Heinz gift. “It will not,” it was
pointed out, “fulﬁll its purpose un-
less from week to week and from
year to year there is here preached
a gospel so intellectually honest and
so morally courageous, so free from
intollerance and superstition, so har-
monious with the best of life as to
send them forth who worship here
with the understanding which makes
men greatly obedient to the laws that
govern their lives.”

The object of the chapel. as Mr.
Heinz showed, was to teach “that
kind of religion every human being
needs.” Thus, if “the many who
thirst for the ﬁner things of life are
refreshed and gladdened as they
drink from this well of helpfulness
and inspiration, this commemorative
sanctuary will not have been built
in vain.”

BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES

Dr. Coffin reiterated the beliefs of
H. J. Heinz, who “believed with all
his heart that the welfare of this
country and of the world depends
upon loyalty to the principles basic
in the Bible.

He stated that a university offer-
ing education to young people should
have a building devoted to a religious
purpose, saying, “No university can
train good American citizens without
concerning itself with their spiritual
convictions and life.”

He further stated that the basic
principles of democracy are based on
religion and that an democratic edu-
cation should include a religious side.

DR. BOWIVIAN ACCEPTS

Chancellor John G. Bowman ac-
cepted the chapel for the University.
He stated that the chapel will be in-
terdenominational. “It will be a
place where groups of students may
retire for quiet meditation and wor-
ship in accord with their own be-
liefs.” He added that the chapel will
serve as a symbol of spirituality for
the student, and may be used by
groups of students of the same faith
for meetings of religious nature.

Music for the service was provided
by Russell G. Wichmann, University
organist, and by a choir comprised of
the Shadyside Presbyterian church
quartet and the University chorus.

Dedication took place before a lim-
ited audience, due to the scarcity of
pews in the chapel.

First student service to be held in
the chapel will be the annual YM-
YWCA Thanksgiving service, an.
which Dr. Kerr will conduct services.

Phi Eta Sigma
Holds Smoker

Phi Eta Sigma, national honorary
freshman scholastic fraternity, will
hold a smoker for a group of fresh-
men on December 15 in the Y Club
rooms, David Tucker, C41, presi-
dent, announced today.

Admission to the affair will be by
invitation, Tucker said.

At the meeting last Thursday,
plans for a Phi Eta Sigma tutorial
service on campus were discussed. A
committee, appointed to study organ-
ization of a tutoring service for
freshmen men, is composed of Har-
old Wintner, BA41; Richard Sonnen-
leld, C41; Robert Norum, C41; and
William Patrick, C41.

Most Popular Outﬁts

Lea Goldstein, C39, and Bill Ba-

Miss Goldstein won a brown reefer

lected by the student audience as be-
ing the most popular.

The winning tickets were drawn
by Dr. John M. Ferguson, associate

Approximately 1,200 students at-

Jay Reich, business manager of The
News and chairman of the event, it
was the most successful in the
school’s history.

Commenting on the show Reich
said, “I appreciate the way the stu-
dent body supported the show.

“This will aid us considerably in
our future dealings with Rosen-
baum"s. I wish to thank all those
who participated in presenting the

City’s Business
Continues Rise

Business activity in the Pittsburgh
district was boosted to a new high

level last week, according to the
University Bureau of Business Re-
search.

Pronounced counter-seasonal gains
in industrial activity and increases
in the volume of freight shipments
have advanced the business index
ﬁgures from 78.7 per cent in the
week of November 5 to 81.7 last

Curtailed working schedules were
counteracted by gains in electric
power and bituminous coal produc-
tion, and steel production, to advance
business trends to the highest levels
in a year.
