Christians poll students on beliefs in Towers Lobby

By John Jacobs
For The Pitt News

Students can express their
religious opinions this week and
next, as FOCUS ’89 presents a
voting booth in Towers Lobby.

 A coalition of Cornerstone,
“Christian Student Fellowship and

the University Christian Outreach,
FOCUS ’89 will present one
statement a day which students
can vote “yes” or “no to.
Tuesday’s statement was “God is

7)

dead.” Other statements include
“Sin exists and man is inherently
evil” and “We can know God
personally.”

Inspiration for this program
came from student religious
apathy. Steve Pepmeyer, co-
leader of the UCO, said, “Basically
we’re living in a pagan culture,
and often times a university setting
is a stepping stone to a long term
lifestyle of partying, sex, etc.”
Pepmeyer said, “The object of
FOCUS ’89 is to raise the issue of

Christ on campus.”

A general concern is that
students find Christian life too
compromising or avoid the
thought of religion altogether.
CSF leader Sam Brunsvold said,
“I think a lot of people feel that if
they get more serious about
Christianity, then they lose their
personal freedom. The issue is
finding whetherjesus limits what
you can do or if Christianity allows
room for personal freedom.”

Pepmeyer’s statement “A lot of

people are in spiritual lethargy,
and we want to shake them up”
is indicative of FOCUS ‘89’s goals.
Brunsvold said, “I think the
students will go back to their
rooms and discuss this issue.
Maybe they'll pull out their bibles
for the first time in a while.”

By noon Tuesday, more than
150 students had voted on the
first statement. Courtney
Ciambotti, CA5 ’91, said she was

attracted to the booth by the

“improper wording of the

question.” She said, “The word
‘Dead’ does not apply to God,
since he was not actually born.”
She voted, however, after
clarifying the”meaning of the
statement.”

The voting booth features a
digital display of the “yes” and
“no” tallies, which are updated
immediately after a vote. It will
be located in Towers Lobby from
10 a.m. -2 p.m. through Thursday
this week, and Monday through
Wednesday next week.

An expanded effort to recruit
able students is just one of the
i reasons why freshman
applications to the College of
Arts and Sciences increased
over 21 percent from 1987 to
1988, according to Betsy Porter,
director of admissions.

“This increase allows us a
greater degree of freedom in
the selection process. Even
though the number of freshman
applicants has risen, we still
have the same target enrollment
figure. Therefore, we end up
with a more competitive class,”
Porter said.

Expanded recruitment efforts
have included targeting a nine-
state region and using a
telemarketing strategy to
improve Pitt’s visibility.

.“The reasons for the increase
go beyond just the work that
c we do to recruit. Pitt is not
quite as ‘expensive as a private
school but offers all of the
of one. That
encourages people to apply
here,” Porter said.

Porter said that Pitt’s showing
in Richard Mo1l’s book, The
Publiclvys, and consistent good
reviews in college evaluation
books have also helped boost
applications.

“The admissions office
encourages students to visit the
university and contacts
guidance counselors at various
schools to point out outstanding
' students so that we can invite

Pitt experiences rise
in CA8 applications

p large

them to special activities,”
Porter said.

While Pitt strives to improve
its enrollment rather than
enlarge it, some Pennsylvania
schools are increasing the size
of their student body.

Though the number of
applications stayed relatively
the 8 same at Swarthmore
College from 1987 to 1988,
enrollment for the freshman
class rose by over 30 percent.

Pennsylvania State
University only experienced a
increase in overall
enrollment and a more modest
increase in their freshman class
in 1988.

“We’re just not seeing
freshman apply; we’re also
enrolling re-admits and
returning adults. There is a
shift in the balance of students
that we attract,” said Christy
Rambeau, assistant news
manager for public
information at Penn State.

Rambeau said that the
increase in the high school
graduating class and the large
amount of media attention
about the difficulty of getting
into a competitive school also
affected the class size in 1988.

“All of the attention caused
freshmen and transfers to file
multiple applications at
different schools. Some of
them chose Penn State
because it is a competitive
and solid university at a good
value,” Rambeau said.

Chinese students petition Bush

By Milt Klppfer
Staff Writer

A letter and memorandum
urging President Bush to take a
stronger stance against the
Chinese government will be
presented to him today by the
Chinese Students and Scholars
Society of- the University of
Virginia, during his visit there.

The documents have been co-
signed by the University of
Pittsburgh Chinese Students and
Scholars Friendship Association
and drafted with the input of a
Pitt graduate student.

“Bush and his administration
have been two--sided,” said Mark
Sun, a mechanical engineering
graduate student who provided
the memorandum's authors with
his perspective on the political
aspects of United States-China
relations.

“There are some who have the
opinion that the lTiananmen
Square} massacre could have been

avoided if [the administration]
had expressed its concern in time.
Bush, in his policy, is far too soft
on the Chinese government,” said
Sun.

The memorandum states that it
wants diplomatic relations with
the Beijing government to
continue. “We do,” it reads,
“want the American government
to take a firm stand on the side of
the Chinese people to take
appropriate measures to push
the Chinese government toward
democratization.”

Sun is not in total agreement,
believing that the United States
should have recalled its
ambassador from Beijing
immediately following the
massacre.

He does, however, support the
request for firmness. “I really hope
that Americans can appear at this
time to have the same spirit that
Uohnl Steinbeck showed in the
Grapes of Wrath.”

Such ﬁrmness, in Sun’s view,

should take the form of halting

student, faculty and business‘

personnel‘ exchanges “until
Chinese anti—democratic policies
stop and [the government] admits
the legal right for Chinese
[democratic] political
organizations to exist.”

The memorandum also urges
that “the United States
government do nothing that
would provide ﬁnancial and
economic support for China’s
ruling clique.”

According to Sun, a program of
limited economic sanctions
carried out by the United States
against China would speed the
process of democratic reform.

“If economic sanctions are
imposed,” said Sun, “in 10 or 15
years the central government’s
power will break down [due to]
the opposing parties and
underground organizations
gaining more and more power.”

‘ Coal conference to be beld at Pitt

By Maria Perez
For The Pitt News

This week, the University of
Pittsburgh School of Engineering
will host a major national
conference of organizations
involved with the coal industry to
discuss ideas, policies and
technologies in that field.

Experts from over 30
organizations, such as conference
chairmen A. Flower of the Gas
Research Institute and
Mayﬁeld of the Department of
Energy, will attend the Sixth
Annual Pittsburgh Coal
Conference. The number of
conferees will be in excess of
500, including about 80 high
school teachers, said Gerald D.
Holder, chairman of Pit_t’s
chemical engineering department
and one of the seven hosts of the
conference.

Pitt faculty will present papers
and chair sessions dealing with

 

Smith Corona presents three products that can

thisyear’s theme, “Coal-Preparing
for the Future: From Lab to
Marketplace.”

“[Pitt] will also be giving an
award to Congressman John
Murtha for his legislative
contributions to coal conversion
innovation,” said Holder.

Scheduled for discussion is
the topic of government policies
toward the coal industry. The
assistant secretary of fossil energy
will talk about government energy
policy, including President Bush’s
proposed Clean Air Act
Amendment, part of which
discusses the problem of acid
rain. Coal-cleaning techniques

help reduce acid rain by disposing A

of the sulfur found in coal.
Holder said there is a large
amount of sulfur in Pennsylvania
coal, and Pitt has its own patented
coal-cleaning process called
licado, during which the sulfur is
removed from the coal before it
is burned. Two other ways of

reducingsulfur are to burn coal
without sulfur and to remove the
sulfur after burning the coal.

Other seminars and
presentations during the five- day
conference will emphasize the
issues of the “greenhouse effect,”
coal liquefaction, combustion,
nitrogen oxide removal, research
needs and the importance of the
roles of universities, government
and industry. '

Throughout the conference,
international competitiveness will
be a major issue, according to Dr.
James T. Cobb, Jr., associate
professor of chemical engineering
at Pitt and co-chairman of the
program committee. About one-
third of those attending the
conference are international

< delegates from approximately 30

countries, as part of the newly
developed International
Participation Program.

Counseling
required
for loans

By Andrea Barczykowski
For The Pitt News

Under new federal
requirements, all Pitt students
accepting the Stafford loan for
the first time must undergo loan
counseling.

This increased concern was
caused by “significant pockets of
abuse by student borrowers,”
according to Suzanne McColloch,

a counselor at Pitt's ﬁnancial aid

office; “Especially under the
Reagan Administration, there was
a lot of concern about loan

. defaults,” McColloch said.

A Students who don't make their
payments are subject to financial

penalties, loan garnishment,

withholding of tax refunds,.and
court action may be used against

them. To avoid this kind of
situation, the new regulation states
that all schools must either
conduct an interview with the
borrower, or present a prepared
video to the student before they
receive the loan.

Any Pitt student who will be
using the Student Loan program
must view this type of video.
“The video emphasizes the
seriousness of
responsibilities,” said McColloch.

The default rate of Pitt recipients
is just above 5 percent, relatively
low compared to other schools,
especially trade and vocational
institutions, which tend to have
high default rates.

PPC obtains television
decoder to aid deaf

By Shelena Rauscher
For The Pitt News

A closed caption decoder for
the TV room of the William Pitt
Union was recently purchased
by the Pitt Program Council Video
Committee for $180. The decoder
will allow subtitles to appear on
the screen so the deaf will be able

to make better use of TV facilities. ,

Dana Keefer, program
coordinator for the Pitt Program
Council, felt the purchase was a
good idea. “In the past we always
had interpreters at events. We felt
since [the deaf] use the TV room,
it would be a nice addition.”

Karen Walkney, instructor of
sign, language, had mentioned
the decoder to the PPC. She said
she was very excited about the
purchase. “I loved, it. It’s about
time they did something. If they
are promoting equal rights, they

I should provide for them.”

Previously at lectures

sponsored by the PPC, members
of Sign Connection had
interpreted for the hearing
impaired. Founded in 1983, Sign
Connection’s main goal is to
spread deaf
throughout the university and the
surrounding community. The first
meeting of this term was held on
Sept. 26.

Walkney’s students in her sign
language courses are all
encouraged to participate. They
must express an interest I and
desire to learn more about sign
language and deaf culture. She
also said they must be motivated
and dedicated. ‘

Mary DePellegrini, Sign
Connection member and student
in Sign 3, said, “Encouragement
from Karen got me involved. Once
I got involved I wanted to get
more involved. It enables you to
get involved with the deaf
community a lot.”

The Lady Panthers won only

one of their three matches this

No. 1 1 ranked Kentucky 7-15, 15-

Pitt’s third opponent was
Kentucky. In this match, Pitt

game but turned it on after that.

They came out in the second
game “psyched and ready to
play.” Julie Sheils led the team
with 14 kills.

match we had

Woodstra said.

Stanford, I was
happy with our
performance,” said Pitt 1 head
coach Sue Woodstra. “These types
of opponents will help us by the
end of the season when the big
tournaments ‘come along.”

In the first game Pitt was able
toplay tough against Stanford.

‘ “The match should have gone

to five games. We had leads of
10-2 and 14-9 in the fourth game,
but we just couldn’t pull it out,”
Woodstra said.

“I respect Stanford in being
able to come back like that. They
have been in matches like these
before, and they know how to
come back against good teams.
This will help us learn how to put
games away.” In the second
game Pitt played their host,
Nebraska. Woodstra claimed the
Panthers did not play well.

Pitt’s only
member on the All-Tournament
Team was Sheils. Sheils has been
a member of a tournament team
in every tournament Pitt has
played in this season. Sheils’ best
game this weekend came against
Stanford, in which she had 26
kills. “That is a pretty remarkable
stat seeing she went up against a
couple of All Americans on the
Stanford team,” Woodstra said.
Pitt will take its 9-4 record

against visiting Robert Morris at’

the Field House, Thursday at 7:50

“Robert Morris is not a very
strong team. We’ll try to use this
game as a tune-up,” added

If anyone out there read any of the
local papers or listened to any type of
color commentary during the later 4
p.m. starts of this past NFL Sunday,
then you would have heard a general
disbelief about the Steelers whipping
the Vikings but good.

You would have heard how good
Minnesota’s No. 1 rated defense was,
but how it just wasn’t a good day for
the Vikings, how a team many pick to
go to the Super Bowl lost to one of the,
if not the worst, team in football.

At the risk of upsetting a colleague
of mine, let me clue everyone in on a
‘ittle secret. The Vikings are the most
overrated team in NFL history.

They have been picked for the past
couple of years to win the Super
Bowl. They haven't even played in a
Super Bowl since the Raiders crunched
them way, way back in the 1970s to

post the all-time Viking Super Bowl
. record at 0-4. ’

You see, not only do the average
hard-core sports fans who claim to be

authorities on every professional sport
pick the Vikings every year, but actual
respected professional sports
journalists pick this team season after
season, only to be vastly disappointed.

There is a big difference between

 

saying a team is either excellent or a
definite play-off contender, and
claiming a team is going to the Super
Bowl to take it all.

Now the latter statement is a grand
claim to live up to, and the Vikings
have not even gotten to the coveted
game. This season’s start is indicative
of what will happen to “football’s best
team” yet again this year. Sure, it’s a
long season, but a 1-2 start is nothing
to get excited about.

I remember a couple of years ago,
all of a sudden, the Vikings were

supposed to be the hottest and the
best team in football. They are now
the media’s baby, and all kinds of
excuses are made when they lose.
Take this past Sunday’s Steeler game.
I actually heard Al Michaels say during
Monday Nz'gbtFootball that the Steeler
win was going to be the biggest upset
of the season. Why? Because they beat
the Vikings? And I’m not that partial to
the Steelers; I would say the same
thing if Minnesota lost to Tampa Bay.
Regardless of how “good” or “bad”
people think a football team is, the
NFL is a professional football league,
and any team is capable of beating
another on any given week, no matter

what the line or how outrageous the 4.

match up may seem.

In fact, I wasn’t the least bit surprised
when I heard the Steelers beat the
Vikings.

I can think of three teams in the NFL
alone who are worthy of more attention
than the Vikings. And for some bizarre
reason, nationally

syndicated -

sportswriters and broadcast journalists
do not convey their disappointment in
Minnesota’s lack of living up to their
lofty claims. They merely look ahead
to the next season, and say again how
good Minnesota will be.

The Vikings are, to quote another
colleague of mine, “the Montreal Expos
of football.” Every year they are decent,
but every year they fail to win the big
one. » ,

Obviously, certain individuals think
Minnesota has all of the ingredients it
takes to win it all. Perhaps they do, but
these ingredients are either being
mixed in the wrong way or else they
are cheaper substitutes for the real
stuff it takes for a championship ball
club.

For the past few seasons, the Vikings
have been good, but they have also
been a severe disappointment in filling
a lot of people’s expectations.

There are only so many times when
one can say, “wait until next year,”
before next year never comes.

TAs pose language barrier
The language barrier between students and foreign
teaching assistants has long been a source of frustration
and confusion for both parties involved.
1 Why does this have to be so? There are many obvious
solutions to this problem just waiting to be applied.
The most glaring possibility is to stop using foreign
students who are having problem with the English
language. In lower-level classes such as Calc 22 and 23,
English-speaking undergraduates could replace foreign
‘ graduate‘ students. They may not have as much knowl-
edge, but a vast amount of knowledge does no good to
a TA, if the student cannot even understand him. A
Another possibility, which is not quite so drastic, is to
make absolutely sure that the person selected as a TA has
a full, working knowledge of the language he is to teach
in before classes begin. Currently, T As are only required
I to take an English course during the term in which they
are teaching. They do have to take an examination before
they can teach, but obviously the grading onthis exam is
too lenient. - r T I
SGB member Harper Watters has been working with
Shahna Cole, president of the Engineering Student Cabi-
net, to try to eleviate this problem. One of their sugges-
tions is to step up the grading on the aforementioned
exam. This is a good idea.  ’
Another idea the SGB ‘is currently working on is to
. introduce a student council to sit in on the TA interviews.
Since the students are the ones who must be able to
understand the TA, shouldn’.t the students be the judges
as to whether or not the TA is speaking clearly?
Watters asserts that the faculty members he has spoken
with have been very supportive and previously claim
they were unaware of the magnitude of thisproblem.
Watters states, “Hopefully, there will be some changes
made — because there needs to be.” I
Watters is right.

Racial tensions are causing serious
Y 3

[...] During the past weekend, cent people were serious c-

an issue came to my attention that
could possibly plague our cam-
pus and ensue great anger among
black and white college students.
Perhaps it is already plaguing our
campus and just hidden. Regard-
less, it has never received cover-

 

age in even The Pitt News.

The incidents of which I write
involve violence between blacks
and whites. Not just simple “rough-
ing up” of one another, but seri-
ous violence resulting in the need
for major medical care.

On Saturday night, in two sepa-
rate incidents, at least six inno-

costed on South Oakland streets.
Their injuries amounted to
bruised ribs, broken noses and
wrists, and a total of 43 stitches.

It is obvious that a serious
racial problem exists on this
campus, but it would be unfair to
place blame on one race or the
other. In the incidents I’ve men-
tioned, the assaulted students
were entirely unaware and un-
provoking. Police responded
slowly and nothing was immedi-
ately resolved.

My point is that a racial prob-
lem does exist between black
and white students and the un-
fortunate resolution so far has
been pointless violence. l.,.l

great music, but isn’t there any
other music out there today that’s
worthy of air time? To many, this
very thought is sacrilege. “If it’s

 it’s just not American.”

A The frightening thing is that it’s
not only the middle-aged crowd

that feels that way. Many of to-

agree. Hence, the two biggest
concerts of the! summer in Pitts-

and The Who. So what are we up
to as Americans? What do we see
in that era that makes it so mes-

Evolution vs. Creationism: the controversial war rages on

Ever since the 1988 election,
politicians have claimed the epi-
thet, “education.” When politi-
cians speak, you can expect to
hear something about “excellence
in education” and “our public
schools are our future.” Their
rhetoric is justified —- functional
illiteracy and the fact that high
school students think Africa is a
country south of Texas no longer
shock our sensibilities. But just
when everyone thought we've
hit bottom, think again.

The Evolution v. Creationism
war has spread from Texas to
California. California and Texas
are our country's top bulk pur-
chasers. of textbooks. Books
chosen in these states most likely
become national editions. Lead
by fundamentalists and otherJerry
Falwell prototypes, we may have
public school science textbooks
with creationism included, in-
stead of evolution.

The holiday. American Heri- 9

Stage Dictionary defines this

enigma as “a day set aside to
celebrate a particular event.”
Sounds innocent enough, but if
you'd look at the list of “ob-
served” holidays in some states,
you would get the feeling that
somehow the “holy day” has been
subverted and prostituted.
Some holidays actually deserve
to be venerated —— such as Inde-
pendence Day and Memorial Day.
But for each justified holiday there
is a busload of losers. Observe:
Bird Day (April), World Poetry
Day (Oct), Elizabeth Cady Stan-
ton Day (Nov.), Confederate
Heroes’ Day (March) and of
course, where would we be with-
out the much vaunted King
Kamehameha I Day (June).
Many “holidays” are just beg-
ging to be lampooned -— like
Groundhog Day. Where are my
Animal Rights activists? Come on,

Pittsburgh Public School district
and every school across the
country will have no choice but
to purchase textbooks excluding
evolution from the material cov-
ered.

Just as they have over many
years, politicians try to avoid
controversy. They do not want to
offend a minority faction of the
religious establishment. Publish-
ers also try to avoid controversy
and have deleted evolution from
books in the past. It has only
been since March 1989 that Texas
public schools required the in-
clusion of evolution in biology
textbooks. Cooing the crazies,
even former president Reagan
reminded us that evolution is
only a “theory.”

Well, creationism is also only a
“theory,” in a loose sense of the
word. However, evolutionary
theory has a large body of evi-
dence outside of disputed theo-
logical interpretations; creation-
ism doesn’t. Evolutionary theory
has applications in biochemistry
and advanced medicine. What
does creationism offer? So often

guys, back me up on this one! On

when the poor vermin tries to
crawl baek to his bed, he is
grabbed and shackbeaten by the
populace who don’t desire an-
other six weeks of winter.

And how about St. Patrick’s

their own holiday in America? St.
Patrick, supposedly by divine
grace, drove all the snakes out of

critical former president, Ronald
Reagan, recently asked those
same “evil evolutionists" to drain

President Reagan would rather
visit a medieval doctor bloodlet-
ting patients with leeches.
Creationists tend to be humor-
ous apologetics. Some creation-
ists assert that God has tricked
humans by creating fossils to cast
an illusion of evolution, attribut-
ing this deceit to (guess who)
Satan. Some claim the Earth is
only 5,000 years old, and geo-
logical structures, like the Grand
Canyon, eroded in a week! Some
accept that the earth is older than
5,000 years but still reject evolu-
tion. T o pull this off, they multi-
ply the seven daysof the Genesis

don’t see them having parades
and closing the banks for it.
Coming up sometime next
week is Columbus Day. What a
major misnomer. Everyone knows
by now that Columbus bumped

‘into Cuba, Hispaniola and parts

of Central America but nowhere
near what is now the United
States. Sheesh, even the entire
continent is named after
Columbus’ paisan Amerigo
Vespucci. But then I guess
Vespucci Day doesn’t have the
same oomph that Columbus Day
possesses. '

Perhaps my favorite holiday‘ is
St. Valentine’s Day. This Hall-
mark-invented day has absolutely
nothing to do with the beheaded
Italian martyr way back in the
times of the Emperor Claudius.
Instead, this is the day to stick a

story by millions of years to rec-
oncile the geological differences.
Bordering on the absurd, Russ
Bixler announced on television
that dinosaurs had accompanied

However, this is not physically
possible — actual biblical meas-
urements of the Ark severely limit
dinosaur carrying capability. The
famous ark could not hold even
one brontosaurus.

Worse than deleting evolution
would be to allow creationism in
public school textbooks, thereby
opening a ﬂoodgate for every
religious sect in the country to
pontificate their beliefs. Funda-
mentalists may battle “New Age”

theology over differing creation.

views. Even creationist theology
varies among adherents; we may
witness wars between rival crea-
tionist camps. .

Clearly, the creationist demands
violate our constitutional guaran-
tee of the separation of church

Today's democrats are nothing like the late, great JFK

In retrospect, one has to won-
der what the most hilarious
moment of the 1988 presidential
campaign was. Although the at-
tempt by the Dukakis—Jackson
coalition to dub Bush a “racist”
because of the Willie Horton ad
and the advent of the democratic
revelation that there is a deﬁcit
are definite contenders, the true
side-splitter has to be Dukakis’
fatuous claim that he was a “JFK
liberal” —— and the democrats
buying it.

It’s easy to understand why
the modern Democratic Party
might want “another JFK." How-
ever, Michael Dukakis did not fit
the category, neither, for that
matter, did McGovern nor Mon-
dale. In fact, the hypocrisy and
extreme partisanship of the
modern Democratic Party is un-
equivocally exhibited in the

‘-Jtnanner in which they salute JFK

9.’

as their party hero and then
completely contradict themselves
by nominating JFK anti-thesises:

McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis
and probably Mario Cuomo
(“Dukakis II”) in ’92. How can
they canonize JFK and then
support these outta-whack liber-
als? ' ' 1
Despite his claim, with the ex-
ception of some domestic pro-
grams, Dukakis’ policies had no
resemblance to JFK’s. In 1986,
Governor Dukakis refused to

‘ acknowledge a presidential re-

quest for state National Guard
units to be sent to Central Amer-
ica (a refusal found to be uncon-
stitutional by a U.S. District Court
and the U.S. Congress). JFK was
never reluctant to send troops as
he did so in Vietnam and Thai-
land in 1962.

Even more ridiculous is that
the modern democratic platform
totally rejects the JFK legacy. Al-
though Lloyd Bentsen sent the
democratic crowd of the v.p.-
elect debate into a euphoric frenzy
when he informed Dan Quayle
that he was “no Jack Kennedy,"

the beliefs of the Vice President
and Republican party are far more
similar to the late President’s than
those of the democrats. , ‘

While JFK is still lauded by the
modern Democratic Party for his
commitment to put a man on the
moon, a declaration by Bush to
put a man on Mars was assailed
by the democrats as “a giant leap
for starry—eyed political rhetoric,”
said D—Sen. Jim Sasser. D—Sen. Al
Gore deemed the proposal “a
daydream as splashy as a George
Lucas movie.” Great dedication
and vision, eh, JFK?

JFK laid the foundation for the
manufacturing of 1,000 B-52
bombers, yet modern House
democrats laughingly trash the
idea of 132 Stealth bombers. It’s
“a turkey,” jests D-Rep. Pat Schroe-
der.

Even more ludicrous is the in-
solence of the Democratic Party
for its chastising of Ronald Re-
agan’s arms-for-hostages deal. In

1962, JFK was praised for a deal

in which he sent $50 million
worth of food and medicine to
Castro’s Cuba (at a time when the
U.S. Congress had cut ties with
Cuba) in exchange for soldiers
taken as prisoners in the Bay of
Pigs invasion. The question must
arise: why was it okay for JFK to
deal with Castro — who's reign

 

09

has created far more problems

, for the United States than terror-

ism ever will —— but wrong for
Reagan to deal with Iran?

JFK advocated tax reductions
to spark investment and create d
jobs —— precisely the policy that
was employed by Ronald Reagan
(and now Bush), which did just
that. The JFK reduction propos-
als were carried through under
Lyndon B. Johnson and resulted

in five years of economic growth. A

The Reagan cuts are going on

seven years of continued growth.
The democrats have notoriously
labeled_ these tax cuts as “tax
breaks for the rich," and any
democrat that supports them is
considered a party traitor. Wasn't
JFK a democrat? The lobotomy of
today’s Democratic Party appears
to be complete. V ~-

In 1960, the Democratic Party
and JFK platformed for a strong
military, for-the U.S. to “support
any friend [and] oppose any foe,”
“what you can do for your coun-
try” and equal rights. Today it
represents military cuts, U.S. iso-
lationism, the Welfare State (what
your country can do for you),
quotas and tax increases

Perhaps Pat Buchanan stated
it best; “Today's democrats would
never nominate JFK; with his
views, he would be dismissed as
a ‘right-wing clone’ of Ronald
Reagan.” C

match; 6-1, 6-2.

The Panthers won five out of
six singles matches with other
victories coming from Terence
Rosenthal, Maben, John T egano
and Larry Garrard.

One of the few close singles
matches was Rosenthal’s three
set victory. After Rosenthal
dropped the first set, Kumar said,
“He [Rosenthal] ﬁnished well and
picked up his game to win the
last two sets.” Rosenthal then
came back to provide the other
doubles victory with his partner
Terry O’Connor.

A big factor in the victory was

Pitt’s depth. The Panthers have
returned all of their starters from
last year, while Robert Morris
only has about half of the same
personnel from last year’s battle.

One of the strongest aspects of
the Pitt squad appears to be the
senior doubles tandem of Maben
and Kumar. Kumar said, “Paul
and I have been getting
comfortable and should play a
big factor for the rest of the year.”

I The team will now have a long
layoff with their next match not
taking place until Oct. 28 at Ohio
University.

  Men's tennis team

impliments video
training methods

By Adam Kamras
For The Pitt News

Did you ever watch Michael
Jordan perform for three hours
and feel as though you are
ready to go out and score fifty
points?

Did you ever spend six hours
on a Sunday watching football
and then feel like you could

gun the ball downﬁeld like

John Elway? .

If so, you are a product of 0

sports psychology. One
advocate of this idea is Paul
Maben, the No. 3 player on
Pitt's men’s tennis team.

Two years ago, Maben
purchased Cybervision, a 90-
minute vide o cassette that deals
with neuromuscular
programming. “It gives you
psychological methods to get
over the fear of losing and to
enter the optimal playing
situation,” Maben said.

On the tape, the viewer
watches tennis legend Stan
Smith continually hit shots.

Maben said, “After watching
the tape for a while you picture
yourself doing exactly what he

does. ”

He explained how the tape ’

works on the concept of
visualization in which you feel
like you’re becoming that
person.

“It gives you a feeling of
confidence which enables you
to feel that you have the ability
of the person on the tape,”
said Maben. “Once you learn

' how to visualize what you

want to do [hit a stroke] then
you don’t have to practice as
much. More time is devoted to
off-court preparation.”

On reaching the optimum
level of concentration, Maben
added, “You get into a zone
where you feel like you can’t
miss a shot. The ball appears
slower and bigger when you
concentrate on the seams and
nothing else.”

Maben emphasized that in
an individual sport such as
tennis, it can sometimes be
tough to keep one’s
concentration and confidence.

One really does not have the

luxury of getting a pat on the
back from a teammate to lift

Bucks; or {truth

The end of the month finally came. What a great month
it was, too! We set a new sales record. My company
profits were at an all-time high. I've poured by life into
this company, and things are going better than I could
ever have imagined. In a few more years, it will be time
to relax and enjoy the fruits of my labor. Actually, I
already have a lot to show for my sweat. I drive the car
of my dreams - a Jaguar; My $300,000 home is the envy
of all my friends, and I have a boat that anyone would

you must surrender your life; you have made your

I Are you trying to become wealthy for yourself, while

remaining poor in God's sight? When the night comes
for you to surrender your life, will God call you a fool?

Now is the time to decide what you want to commit
your life to. We are truly foolish if we make materialism
and worldly wealth our goal in life.

Ourgoal should be to serve God. Our goal should be to
commit our whole being to becoming wealthy in the

sight of God. On

The men’s cross country team
placed third in two consecutive
invitational meets held at Penn
State and Malone College.

On Sept. 16, the team traveled
to Happy Valley for [he Penn
State Invitational. The course at
Penn State is a fast and relatively

easy course compared to any of 0

those that Pitt has run on this
year. Even with poor conditions
on the ﬁve-mile course, Pitt was
able to get its top five runners
within 44 seconds of each other.
Pitt lost to Penn State and South
Florida University.

Keith Dowling, seventh overall
and first for Pitt, ran. a time of 25
minutes, 4 seconds. Dowling
wanted to finish either first or

4

second in the race and beat Penn
State’s No. 1 runner, Steve Brown,
but unfortunately, neither one
happened.

“I ran with [Brown] for the first
mile, but after that he and a pack

of runners broke away,” said E

Dowling.

Coming in second for Pitt was _

Things are looking up for
the Lady Panther cross country
team. ‘

At Saturday’s Slippery Rock
Invitational, the young runners
continued to improve.

Sophomore sensation Stacy-
Wyzykowski : continued her
early season success.
Wyzykowski is new to cross
country this year and claimed
her second victory in three
races. She ﬁnished with atime
of 20 minutes, 24 seconds.

0 She was not the only runner

who progressed this weekend
as the Panthers finished third
out of 17 teams, behind winner
Allegheny and‘ runner-up
Slippery Rock.

Coach John Vasvary was
pleased with his team’s
showing. "

“We’re going in the right
direction. Our spacing : is
getting much better, but we
still have to improve,” Vasvary
said.

So far, the Panthers have
improved theirdistance from
the leaders by at least a full
minute each week.

Also ﬁnishing in the top ten

It can be very harmful if you’re

thinking about errors you ’ve made ‘

and start to lose your
concentration. “This tape makes
you» concentrate solely on the
ball. You forget about the score
and your past mistakes,” Maben
said.

The sports psychology
movement in tennis was started
by a book titled Innertennis,
written several years back. Over

the last few years sports
psychology has seen rapid growth
to the point that many ‘top players
have a personal sports

McEnroe, and Ivan Lendl are

current believers of various

programs.

Cybervision, “which sells for
approximately $50, is available

baseball and racquetball. In a

with individual aspects, such as
hitting, where , complete
concentration and conﬁdence are
