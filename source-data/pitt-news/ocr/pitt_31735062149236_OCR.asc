Edinburgh Lecturer ilndertakes
Teaching Position at University

By Ralph Kallock

Dr. Peter Gray, formerly lecturer
in embryology at the University of
Edinburgh, Scotland, arrived in Pitts-
burgh last week to begin his work
as associate professor of biology at
the University.

In an interview with The News,
Dr. Gray declared that he much
preferred American universities to
those of Europe.

Surprised at “Hills”

He came to America because he

wanted _to, and he couldn’t under-

stand why anyone would not want to 5

live in the United States, he said.
He lived in France and England

for a time and has traveled in many

other Old World countries. He did

embryological research at Rochester,‘

New York, and once attended a con-
vention at Pittsburgh.

Dr. Gray expressed a hope that he
would “make his home here for
many years.” Being a Londoner, a
city the‘ size of Pittsburgh did not
confuse him, although he was sur-
prised at the “up and downness” of
the city. At present he is living in
the Georgian Apartments with his
wife, his mother, and his son, Oscar.

To Teach Anatomy

Dr. Gray will teach the courses in
anatomy and experimental morphol-
ogy formerly taught by Dr. H. H.
Collins. He will also direct the re-
search activities of graduate students
in the ﬁeld of experimental mor-
phology.

In the research, Dr. Gray will ex-

out that American -institutions have
only the discipline of personality as
compared to the stringent rules and
regulations of foreign schools. He
said, also, “Students in Great Britain
often go to college because they are
sent or because of family tradition.
Here, they go because they prefer to
and not because their parents sent
them.”

Look Forward

Dr. Gray regretted that he was
unabale to attend the last hockey
game and said he was looking for-
ward to his ﬁrst football game next
season.

Author of many scientiﬁc articles
and books, Dr. Gray is also an au-
thority in ﬁve ﬁelds of zoology. He
received his Ph.D. degree from the
University of -London and the Diplo-
mate of Imperial College degree from
the Imperial college of London. He
spent a year at the University of
Rochester on a Rockefeller Founda-
tion fellowship.

I Students are divided as to how or
i if it should be amended.
I Some contend that the board
?should be empowered to enforce ar-
bitration in all industrial disputes.
They point out that compulsory ar-
,bitration is a more practical method
iof settlement than strikes.
Opponents to this theory maintain

.that only 13 per cent of industrial,

idisputes result in strikes. They also
iclaim that the NLRB could not ade-
lquately enforce its decisions.

. Possible Amendment

f Another possible amendment
gwould grant employers more rights
gthan at present. Supporters of this

E Carrying out the main idea of
‘,Christian fellowship, joint commis-

lsocieties retaining their own general
§- committees.
§ These commissions are special in-
}terest groups dealing with the prin-

igroups, sub-committees will be ap-
zpointed to carry out the various
projects of the commissions with in-
dividual leadership subordinate to
.the executive committees of the com-
missions.

In addition to the joint commis-
sions, social, community service, pub-
licity, and inquiry committees will
be organized. The YMCA will con-

induction, and assignment commit-
tees. The freshman, engineers and
mines, pre-medical “and business ad‘-

They told me that today would
be my day oﬁ. According to care-
fully laid plans, the feminine mem-
bers of The News staff were to take
over production of today’s issue of
the paper, and the men according-
ly planned to abdicate for a rest-
ful afternoon. -

New Boss Objects

But the new boss, Dorothy Cle-
land, promoted for an issue from
the women’s editor desk, had other
ideas. Just as I was stealing from
the office, I was intercepted, blunt-
ly informed that I had an assign-
ment. ,

So here I am pounding a type-
writer, with women all about me,
raising a clamor that sounds like the
News women’s staff has been seeing
movies about newspapermen.

Dorothy Takes Raps

At the battered yellow desk, which
usually supports the editor’s size
81/2’s, sits Miss Cleland, looking her
tiny, business like‘ self. Until to-
day, Dorothy has avoided the lime-
light, has been content to perform
the grinding details of her job with
the utmost of executive ability.

Today, however, is her turn to
transfer that organizing ability to
bigger things and, incidentally, we
take the rap for all those little
things for which editors customarily
take raps.

Open house for women students,

facultv will be held on the entire
twelfth ﬂoor from 3 to 5 o’clock. On
display during this time will be a
Hall of Fame and an art and book
exhibit. Some of the outstanding
women graduates of the University
will be honored by a place in the
Hall of Fame. The art and book
display in 1217 features paintings
and books by women artists and
writers.

Ruby Pernell, C39, will give an
informal talk on the painti.ngs which
are being shown. Mary Margaret
McKeown, Ed3'9, is in charge of the
book display.

Something special in the way of a
free treat has been prepared by the
Tuck shop. The treat will be given
away to all students. Men are not
excluded from the “at home tea” to-
day provided they are accompanied
by a woman. ,

Tags of admission to the assembly
will be given to all women students.
On the platform at the assembly
will be: Mrs. Woodhouse; Miss

Women’s Activities
Spread to New Fronts
W l’l‘Il the observance of ‘Woman’s Day today,

we ccmmeinorate the admission of women to
the University in 1895. Since those ﬁrst women
passed through the doors of the administration
building as students, much has happened to change
the status of women so far as their participation
in activities formerly restricted to men both in
our country, and in other leading countries
throughout the world is concerned.

Not only have they broken the men’s monopoly
of business executive positions and relieved the
li'i(‘.l1 of a few of the important government admin-
istrational duties, but they have even taken place
on the battleﬁeld.

In GC'1'lnt1l1_Y, Russia and Italy, women are re-
ceiving military training almost as rigid as the
training mt-n receive; in Spain and China, women
are ﬁghting in the front-line trenches. Perhaps
more than anything else, this participation of wo-
men in military training and service, a movement
that is s‘;ill comparatively young, brings to atten-
tion thc advancement they have made during the
last quarter or half century.

History reveals that at times there have been a
-few women wh.o have engaged in wars. Some of
the Greek women did it to help their men who were
losing the battle; Joan of Arc did it also, but in
these instances, their participation was more spon-
taneous than anything else. These women had not
‘prepared and trained for war as the men had, and
probably, after one battle, never played at war
again.

It may be that this new “emancipation” is
something of which the women of the world can
be proud. At last they have reached ﬁnal equality
with men. Certainly the men do not begrudge
them their new-found freedom of the trenches and
battleﬁeld, for most of them who have had a
taste of war have no desire to repeat the per-
formance‘.

But to us it seems a step down. Surely the wayto
end war is not to send more people out to ﬁght. and
die for this cause or that cause. Nor do we think
that such action on the part of women will acid to
their prestige or position in the world. \Ve hope
that the women of the United State realize how
degrading their paiticipation in war would be.

Entering military service for war is a step in ad-
vancement which women might very proﬁtably
avoid. It would be better if they turned their
cfI"orts toward preventing wars rather than add-
ing to the list of “killed in action.”

We Eqlitoriialize
011 An Editorial

OUR editorial of last Friday, entitled “Orders
from ‘Pague’,” we understand, aroused criti-
cism from some sources.

Gist of the criticism was that we were unduly
harsh in our attitude towards the Czechoslovak
‘people,-their culture, and their present leaders un-
der the modiﬁed post.-Vlunich regime. From one
source we were even unbelievably accused of be-
ing pro-Nazi.

\Ve think this reaction, even from a limited
group, requires a rebuttal on our part and a re-
statement of our attitude.

In the ﬁrst place, the editorial’s purpose was
mainly to deplore the actions of so-called dem-
ocratic countries in league-with totalitarianregimes
which left the Czechoslovak nation no choice but
to surrender territory and become a satellite state
of Berlin.

It was, as a rereading will sho v, quite obvi-
ously anti-Nazi in tone, and deﬁnitely sympathetic
with the Czechoslovak people and their troubles.

\Ve did, it is true, intimate that certain leaders
had “sold out.” By this, we did not mean at all
the courageous crisis leaders, Benes, Hodza, and
all the rest, who stood by their guns until con-
vinced that further resistance was futile. W'e were
referring particularly to some leaders of minor-
ity factions within the country, who picked this
unpropitious time to advance autonomy proposals,
and thus only weakened the resistance of Czecho-
slovakia and strengthened the crafty hand of her
enemies.

We have not lost faith in the Czechoslovak re-
public and its peoples. VVe remember the long
suﬂ:'ering the Czechs and Slovaks and allied Slavic
peoples underwent during the days of the Austro-
Hungarian empire; we know well how the super-
human :. efforts of Masaryk a11d Benes brought
about the establishment of the republic.

\Ve are just as ﬁrmly convinced that the love of
liberty and justice, the great Slavic culture will
not die under this new oppression, but will survive
to some day emerge once again even more ﬁrmly

entrenched.

Our editorial was written in resentment—resent-
ment against uncivilized nations who have ruth-
lessly conquered and thrust their ideas upon a help-
less democracy: resentment against more enlight-
ened nations who have done nothing to halt this
process.

We feel certain that the Czechoslovak people
will continue to resent their maltreatment, and in
so doing cling to the ideals of the immortal Mas-
aryk and the courageous Benes.

By Gertrude Lieblich

We came back to school after vacation fresh and
eager to try a new system devised to save souls-and
bodies—in the Cathedral elevators. Premeditated hoard-
, ing was the main idea of the system. Those persons al-
‘ ready in an elevator would engage in a collective action,
known as “space-hoarding,” in order to prevent too
many other persons from crowding on the elevator and
sharing the space.

This is how the system would work: The ﬁrst ten
or twelve persons pushed into an empty elevator on the
ground ﬂoor would line the walls, as they usually do,
but, under the new system, they would hoard six inches
of space between themselves and the walls. No matter
how tightly packed the central section of the elevator
became, they would be honor-bound to preserve this
six-inch space.

When the elevator opened at the ﬁrst ﬂoor, they
could give up their hoarded space to accommodate the
ﬁrst-ﬂoor people, and yet the elevator would not be
overcrowded.

With the help of some friends, we gave the system a
try-cut. We saved a good six inches behind us, refus-
ing to move back against the wall, and also refusing to
let anyone step in the space behind us. There were
eight less students than usual in that elevator as it left
the ground floor.

The door opened on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, and we surren-
dered our space to eight people who had been waiting
a half hour. The system was working perfectly; every-
one was able to breathe.

Then came the ﬁrst ominous incident—the elevator
boy held the door open a minute longer than necessary.
He waved to a friend in the Commons Room, and our
System of Space-Hoarding fell ﬂat as he shouted, “Room
for one more in this car.”

Over a combined NBC coast-to-coast and trans-oceanic
hook-up last night, “Grand Illusion” now starting its
third week at the Art Cinema was awarded honors as
the foremost foreign ﬁlm of 1938.

From Paris spoke Jean Renoir,.author and director
of the picture, Eric Von Stroheim, who played the in-
tense Van Raulfenstein, France’s Jean Gabin, Marachel
of the play, who can be likened to our Spencer Tracey,
and the whole cast of “Grand Illusion.”

A few days ago the National Board of Reviews chose
it as the best picture of 1938, from any country, and
the New York Film Critics picked it as the best of
the foreign crop, distinctions chosen for this picture.
by this column several weeks back.

Anyone seeing this picture can at once sense the
fervor, the deep feeling projected by its universally,
understandable language, physical and mental suffering,
and recognize its merit. Such a story told with im-
passive understatement can not help but be great.

You profess to be of average intelligence, at least. Go
see “Grand Illusion,” if only to try to disprove all that
has been said about it. See it, and it’s my bet you’ll
come out thinking.

The Penn’s current issue of the March of Time deal-
ing with the refugee situation presents a pertinent inter-
national problem which is becoming more and more
acute with each hour. Filmed in America, in case you
might wonder how disfavorable propaganda like this
was let out of Germany, it shows how that country is
instilling hatred and ridicule in the minds of children
who are just beginning to think. They teach them
that in classrooms where those poor kids haven’t a
chance to distinguish what is right and what ;?.sn’t.
What a pity that they must grow up with ideas like
that formulating their very existence.

Out of this intolerance will one day rise a new and
fresh civilization, cleansed and revived and eager for
life. It must be.

“The Cowboy and the Lady” which is the feature
attraction at the Penn this week is good entertainment.
All kidding aside. it has a wholesomeness about it like
the smell of freshly baked bread or the pungent taste
of apple cider and doughnuts. That’s the only way I
can describe it.

Editor, The Pitt News
Dear Sir:

Again, I would like to use this
means to explain the position of the
Junior Prom committee.

We are sorry that the supply of
reservation tickets is already ex-
hausted, but as we promised origin-
ally the number of tickets would be
limited for this seemed to be the de-
sire of the student body. All stu-
dents had an equal opportunity to
buy tickets but many thought that
our limiting of the supply was just
another publicity stunt. However,
we have kept our faith with the ma-
jority of the student body.

Many studentshave asked why the
dance is being held from 9 till 1 in-
stead of from 10 till 2 as is the case

necessary for us to sacriﬁce by
changing the time of the dance.
However, there will be four hours of
dancing as in all past dances. Clin-
ton must leave Pittsburgh shortly

New York.

We wish to encourage students to
buy their dance tickets on Wednes-
day, Thursday, and Friday of this
week in- order to avoid the last min-
ute rush at the dance. Reservation
tickets must be presented when buy-
ing tickets which are to be sold on

University Students
To Attend Conclave

Any University student is eligible
to take part in this year’s Intercolle-
giate Conference on Government, it
was announced today by Miss Gene-
vieve Blatt, executive director of the
conference.

Founded late in 1933, the ICG is

‘an organization of Pennsylvania col-

5 or political parties. We do not preach

‘tervening years, it dramatizes some

leges and universities, with policies
determi-ned ' by a central executive
board and the officers of local dele-
gations.

“We are not interested in agitation

or even teach. Our purpose is sim-
ply to provide means for students to
learn together how their government
operates,” declares Miss Blatt.

During the years when the general ,
assembly of -Pennsylvania holds its?
sessions, the ICG sponsors model’
unicameral legislatures. In the in-

other form of government activity.
Thus, in 1934 a model constitution-
al convention was held. In 1936, the
presidential election year, the ICG i
met as a model political convention!
Last year, a model conference of state
governors was held.

Tech-Pitt Floor Clash
Initiates Round Robin

For City Championship

Panther Sophomores Defend City Cup
Against Fast Stepping Tartan Juniors

Tech’s cage quintet has coyly invited Carlson’s Panthers intoj Kappa Sigma in basketball Fifidgy
their basketball parlor, and tomorrow night at eight-thirty the P1tt3fte"n°°n 3346 t° am!’ the de en '

ﬁve will turn up at the Tartan gym.

The affair will not be one of Mrs. Miller's pink teas, but will be class’
the initial melee of the annual basketball round-robin between Pitt,‘

Tech,
championship. '

Pitt will be defending the city cup
and the Carlsonmen do not intend to
assume the familiar role that goes
with the Tartan spider-like invita-
tion. Maybe they’ll be ﬂies . . . but
ﬂies in the Tech ointment.

The Hannum outﬁt will floor a
veteran team that last year played
ﬂashes of inspired and mediocre bas-
ketball. If the Techites have reached ‘
a modicum of steadiness and poise,
they'll be an unpleasant basketball
dose for everyone. .

Last year the Panthers toppled’
Tech twice, and if revenge incentive
and psychology is important, then
Tech will have an edge.

Reading from left to right the Tech
team will include Combs, Levings,
Stark, Tumpane, and Loos. Stark is
the backbone of this Tech outﬁt.
Tech dropped to mediocracy last
year while Stark was on the side-
lines with an injury. His return.
sparked the team. l

Jimmy Tumpane is another one of
the Tech bulwarks. A constant scor-
ing threat, Tumpane enhances his
team value by his deadly passing.
The return of the Sugar Bowl expe-
dition puts Mel Cratsley back in uni-
form, and gives Max Hannum an ace
on the bench.

Carlson will probably start the
same lineup that swept Cornell aside.
Paffrath, Port, Kocheran, Johnson,
and Klein will do the hoop swishing
for the Panthers. Eddie Stroloski,
who is pinned to the bench by an
ankle injury, may break into the
lineup during the game.

After tomorrow’s game with the
Tartans, the Cathedral ﬁve will await
the ‘arrival of Westminster for next
Saturday’s game. VVestminster shad-
ed Tech on their last Pittsburgh visit
earlier in the season and made Du-
quesne travel two extra periods be-
fore losing.

After the game with the Titans,

ﬁnal exams.

Debate Teams
To Hold Meets

' Continuing a series of debates be-
tween members of the Men’s and
Women’s Debating Associations, there
will be four meetings between fresh-
men men and sophomore women to-
morrow at 1:10 and 2:30 o’clock in
the two debate oﬁices.

All of the discussions will be on
the high school question of the year,
“Resolved: That the United States
should form an alliance with Great
Britain.”

At 1:30 o’clock in 1212 Cathedral,
William Sayler, C42, and Shep Un-
gar, BA42, will argue the afﬁrmative
against Mae Sleen, BA41, and Regina
Heinz, C41. At the same time, in
1617 Cathedral, Hermoine Goldstein,
C41, and Elizabeth Krowich, C41, are
to uphold the proposition against the
negative claims of Ralph Byer, C42,
and Ralph Naller, BA42.

An hour later, Albert McCardle,
C41, and Edward Tait, C42, willi
speak in favor of the alliance, while
Freda Jaffe, C41, and Rae Weinstein, v
C41, oppose the idea in 1217 Cathed-
ral. In 1917 Cathedral, Helen Lubit,}
Ed40, and Dorothy Thompson, C41,’
will advocate the union, and Leon-
ard O’Connel1, C42, and Sidney Bu-
sis, C42, talk against it. *

leemen Defend
Division Lead

Pitt’s slightly bruised hockey
team, still aching a little from the
killing. pace set up last week by
Yale’s brilliant aggregation, skates

out on the Duquesne Garden ice
Wednesday to face Carnegie Tech.

The Panther, after the Yale night-
mare, are afraid of nothing and are
conﬁdent of holding on to ﬁrst place
in the‘ Eastern Division of the Ohio-
Penn League and remaining the cir-
cuit’s only undefeated team.

Tech, minus Wing Amant and
Center Jack Culver by scholastic in-
eligibility, has lost most of its at-
tack, but should the Tartans show a
defense similar to that displayed
against Duquesne recently, Pitt will
be in for a lively evening.

Coach McSorley will probably
stick to his starting lineup of Ellis
.n the nets, Shiring and Lovett on de-
fense, and Lowe, Artz, and Schil-
decker on the line. The midget line
of Brittain, Schooley, and Friday
should also see considerableaction.

Available for duty on defense will
be Chuck Conick, Len Broida, and
Pat Cusick. - Conick turned in one of
the few Pitt ‘standout performances
against the Bulldogs.

New Riﬂe Team Meets

Scabbard and Blade, honorary

The team will consist of seven
men, to be chosen competitively, an-

{In All-Point Trophy Race
I

BULLETIN—Phi Kappa defeated9‘*

; ing champions from the undefeated

:2: * :1:

elta, of the \\'all-,
ingford Street Phi Gains, ﬁnally‘
succeeded in capturing undisputed

phy race according to the total‘
point count of Jalll1‘<l1'_V 5.

The Phi Gams have amassed a
total of 316 points with the largest
single gain resulting from a ﬁrst in
the Interfraternity Sing.

Trailing the leader are Delta Tau
Delta, Kappa Sigma, and Phi Delta
Theta with 301., 293, and 286 points
respecti'-.*el;~'. At the conclusion of
the winter sports program, these ﬁg-
ures will receive a tumbling around.

Individual winners in basketball,
volleyball, ping pong, and bowling
will receive additional points to those
already gained in actual competition,
and in this ﬁeld, the Phi Gams have
a ﬁne chance of adding to their total,
having as yet to lose in basketball
and volleyball.

Kappa Sigma, winner of the bas-
ketball championship for the past
four years during the undergraduate
days of Johnny Micheloson, Don
Hensley and George Delich is tied
with Phi Kappa, last year’s runner
up, and Phi Gamma Delta in the
basketball league.

All three leaders came through
with victories Thursday night. Kappa
Sigma won from its neighbor,
Phi Delta Theta, 33-27; Phi Kappa
decisively whipped Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, 49-8; and the Phi Gams hadi
little diﬁ‘iculty winning from Lambda
Chi Alpha, 39-27.

Sigma Alpha Mu is also undefeated
in the hard-wood sport, winning its_
third straight victory by conquering
Pi Lambda Phi, 23-11. _

Phi Gamma Delta is batting a 1.000
in the volleyball league, having cap-
tured nine consecutive contests. Pi
Lambda Phi holds second place as the
result of eight decisions in nine starts. 
Also listed as undefeated in the vol-l
leyball league is Phi Delta Theta with ;
six triumphs. 

Delta Tau Delta is the pace setteré
in ping pong with 42 victories and six A
defeats. Phi Kappa is next with 35
wins and 13 losses.

Winter Intramural Program Includes ~

1500 Participants In Three Leagues

Nearly 1,500 men students are tak—¢

ing part in the present Intramural
winter program, according to a re-
lease issued yesterday by the Univer-
sity Athletic News Service.

The present number of participants
represent a gain of from 200 to 300
per cent over last year’s disorganized
setup, under which only the fraterni-
ties were active. .

Wider participation, a primary ob-
jective to the program, has been,
realized to a tremendous degree in!
the case of the Engineers and Inde—l
pendents. With teams made up of]
boys from different neighborhoods,§
the question of leaving school for an;
early ride home has been satisfac-I
torily answered. 3

The engineers have a greater per—i
centage of their total body partici-
pating than any other group, but the}
fraternities are close behind; in some 
cases, the athletically active list hasl
been doubled over last year. _

Despite the widespread team com-i

petition, indiVidua1 activity is sun 5 Trees Gym ﬂoor. Earlier in the sea- ; scheduled for that time, the Bunnies, ;

A schedule of some 600 contests
has been made out for the three
leagues in basketball, handball, vol-
leyball, table tennis, and bowling,
the Stadium ﬂoor having been com-
mandeered for many of the basket-
ball games. '

The freshman sports program, in-
troduced this year, has also proved
exceptionally successful. The pro-
gram not only provides the freshmen
with a chance to compete in organ-
ized team sports under competent in-
structors, but also should serve as an
impetus to the future success of the
intramural program.

With Christmas holidays out of the
way, Fraternities, Independents, and
Engineers are set to continue the
winter program at top speed. Ex-
clusive of the Greeks, four basket-

ball games are carded for this eve-,

play Theta Chi in ping pong with the
winner advancing from the cellar in
this particular sport.

Lambda Chi and Pi Kappa Alpha
meet at four o’clock with the victor
gaining additional percentage points
on the second place Phi Kappa’s. The
ﬁnal celluloid match pits Phi Delta
Theta against Pi Lambda Phi with
the Pi Lams out to avenge the last
second defeat suffered at the hands
of the Phi Delts in touch football.

Lambda Chi Alpha will be on .the

Coed Pariicipatioii
In Activities Grows

Women’s participation in activities
_has greatly increased this year, ac-
'cording to statistics received from
the office of the dean of women.

Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant dean
of women , stated, “Probably few
other campuses have so great a pro-
portion of women participating in
University activities or some form of
social life as has the University.”

A study of the point scale cards re-
{vealed that 712 or 71 per cent of all
} University women have some part in
'activities. Of the women in activi-
ties, 471 or nearly 47 per cent are
carrying points for activities.

The freshman class has a 100 per
cent participation, with approximate-
ly 19 per cent carrying points. Nearly
58 per cent of the sophomore class is
participating, with about 49 per cent
carrying points.

The junior class has a still greater
percentage: 67 per cent participate
and 51 per cent carrying points.
Finally, the senior class leads with
71 per cent participation and 60 per
‘cent carrying points.
