a two—part series.)

President Manuel Pachecl did not let the
University of Arizona fall prey to the
national tuition trend but instead sup-
pressed tuition increases for two years.

In an effort to give University of Arizona
students a break, Pachecl recommended
to the state that tuition costs for the 1992-
’95 year remain constant. The state com-
plied with his request.

Other college students around the coun-
try are not as fortunate. Most colleges and
universities are having to raise their
tuitions to compensate for increasing

costs.

The rising tuition trend is a national
issue, not only an. issue at the University
of Pittsburgh. As surveyed by the New
Yorle Times, last year’s national tuition
increases ran at 11 percent. This year they
are expected to average around 6 percent.

“I understand higher education is going
to have to take a serious look at its costs,”
said Darryl Geddes, assistant director of
news service at Syracuse University.

“We understand the consumer is unable
to afford things at times, so we are going
to have to sit down and find ways to con-
trol costs.”

In a comparative study of three univer-
sities ranging from Syracuse University, a
private institution, to the University of

Tuition rises steadily across the nation

Arizona and the University of California-
Berkeley, both state supported, the New
Yorle Times’ results were confirmed.

Due to rising operating, utility and
housing costs, tuition at Pitt has risen
$2,000. At Syracuse it has increased
$7,260.

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor said in a
recent interview, “[Pitt students] are get-
ting a good education, and hopefully,
they will be getting a better education as
we enhance our libraries, study areas,
dormitories and renovate classrooms."

In an effort to control rising costs,
Syracuse University has restructured some
of its programs. It has targeted decreasing
enrollment, and three years ago placed a

Women ’s varsity sports lack equality in doﬂars

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

(Ea’-z'tor’s Note: This is part one of a two—part

series.)

When the Pitt women’s lacrosse team goes to
Allegheny College next week for its first

road trip in three years, 17 members
will cram into a Honda Civic, a late-
model Oldsmobile and a team-
mate’s mother’s station wagon
borrowed for the weekend.
Unlike the Pitt football
team, a club sport like the
lacrosse team does not have
the luxuries of a chartered
flight and a comfortable hotel
stay during an away game.
These are the conditions
that the team has learned to
tolerate, along with no
financial support from the
university athletic depart-
ment. The team has to fund
almost everything, from its
sticks to its uniforms. It even
has to provide its own

“It’s a sad story,” senior

Trankiem said. “We realized
up front that Pitt would do very
little for us. I wish that Pitt had
more respect for women’s

The lacrosse team’s plight is an
example of the athletic inequalities at
Pitt, which is dismally out of compli-
ance with the federal law requiring
gender equity.

Title IX, established in 1972,
states that all universities must
provide equal varsity athletic \
opportunities in propor-
tion to its undergradu-
ate population. In other .
words, if a university is \
50 percent male and 50
percent female, as Pitt is,
there should be just as
many male varsity sports
as female. The penalty
for non—compliance is a
withholding of federal
money.

Toker gets

grant for
book series

By Vic Wallace
Staff Writer

A Pitt fine arts professor
received the National
Endowment of the Humanities
Grant worth $107,000.

Professor Franklin Toker
received the grant to explore the
role of Florence, Italy from the
beginning of the millennium to
the 15th centuryA.D.

The endowment will allow
Toker to produce three books
based on his excavations from
1965 to 1980 below the
Cathedral of Florence.

“I’m delighted to have the
chance to finish the project that
I have been working on for
years,” said Toker, art historian
and medieval archaeologist.

Through excavations he

' found the only scientifically

excavated Roman house in
Florence and the early medieval
church of Saint Reparata.

Saint Reparata is not docu-
mented outside the Florence
Cathedral, which is,why T oker
based ‘part of the excavation on
the saint’s life.

Reparata’s liturgical manu-
scripts are the subject of his first
book. It is scheduled for a 1994
release.

The second book, is expected
to go to press in 1995. It will
present a complete record of the
remains dug up from under the
cathedral. Toker is working on
this book with about 25 other
experts from the United States
and Europe.

The final volume will explain
the physical environment and
structures found at the Florence
site. The third of three books is
expected by 1997.

Toker said the grant he
received to write the books is
nearly spent. He said 47 percent
of it goes directly to the univer-
sity. Another part will give small
grants to the 25 experts working
on Toker’s project. The final
chunk will go toward his salary
while he is on a teaching hiatus.

“I feel guilty and strange [not
teaching]. Teaching is the best
way to become a scholar,” he
said.

Mayoral candidates debate the economy

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

Jack Wagner wanted to know why
Tom Murphy would lie and mislead
people to believe he has had his
car stolen like other people in the
city, when he doesn’t pay for his car
or his insurance. Tax payers pay for
both.

Murphy wanted to know why
Wagner is standing on a platform
to hire 300 new police officers
when he signed a bill less than a
year ago to stop the hiring of new
officers. 9

Wagner and Murphy, both
democratic mayoral primary candi-
dates, denied these accusations
last night in a Student Govern-
ment Board-sponsored debate held at
Pitt.

Four democratic candidates and
one Republican candidate were ques-
tioned on Pittsburgh’s growing crime
rate, the economy and race relations,
as well as feuding accusations
between Murphy and Wagner.

All candidates had differ-
ent approaches to solving the
crime problem. Murphy and

Wagner agreed that deterrents to
committing crime need to be estab-
lished, such as opportunities for
young people. ‘

“You can set up all the community
centers you want, but I’ve talked to
these kids they won’t go to them,”
said Chaston Rosten, another democ-
ratic primary candidate.

“I believe if these kids are going to
commit the crime, they must do the
time and age shouldn’t matter. Let
the, men behind the bars teach the

‘programs. Matta is the only woman

kids.”

Gary Hudson, a democratic can-
didate, said he believed churches
and schools should work toge-
ther in the fight against Pittsburghls
crime.

Republican candidate Kathleen
Matta held her crime platform on
family involvement and volunteer

candidate and said she thinks the city
needs change to see improvement in
crime.

“The ‘good old boy’ politics we
have been experiencing in Pittsburgh
has created our problems,” Matta
said. “Not one woman that is a
Democrat is endorsed by _ the
Democratic Party.”

Matta said that once the city begins
to create change, through the ending

Tobias and-Hearn plan trip
to London With students

By Jennifer N. Spagnuolo
Copy Editor

Two Pitt professors are taking students
out in the field to study literature
and architecture; so far out they want to
spend spring term 1994 in London. This is
the first time Pitt will host a program like
this.

Professor Richard Tobias of the English
department and Fil Hearn, head of the
architectural studies program in the fine
arts department, plan to bring 20 Pitt stu-
dents to London to study cathedrals, the
stage and British history.

The proposal suggests that students will
be able to take a minimum of 12 credits of
regular Pitt courses taught in London at a
cost equal to that of being students on the
Oakland campus. Students will live in a
bed andvbreakfast for the same amount of
Pitt room and board but must pay their
own airfare.

Tobias is going to London this month to
make most of the arrangements.

. “It’s a little bit difficult to find space,” he
said of where they will be holding classes.

In London he will be teaching introduc-
tion to Shakespeare and will adjust the

texts to be read to what plays are running
in London at the time.

“I will probably read fewer plays than I
read in a regular Pitt course and ask the
students to do more reading in British his-
tory. To be able to see British actors per-
form things  We’re hoping to build this
into the program.”

If many of the students are literature
majors, Tobias will teach 19th-century
British literature, and if the majority is non-
majors then he will teach “The Comic Idea:
The British Experience.”

“The comic idea would enable me to
range wider in writing with an emphasis
on genre,” Tobias said.

Hearn is proposing a course on
Canterbury cathedrals and on medieval
English cathedrals. Tobias will design his
literature courses to connect as much as
possible with Hearn’s courses.

“We’ve set a goal of 10 percent of Pitt
students to get international experience,”
Tobias said.

In talking about the upcoming experi-

ence of teaching and studying in London, A

Tobias said, “It’s a new experience for Pitt.
It's sort of scary, but that’s what makes
things fun.”

Wedge is hands—on with
Pitt nursing students

By Julie Holaren
Staff‘ Writer

Watching a mother give birth
to a bouncing baby boy or girl
is said to be the most beautiful
thing in the world, and Karen
Wedge sees this miracle happen
almost every day. ‘

Wedge, a maternity instructor,
takes her nursing clinical stu-
dents to Magee Women’s
Hospital two days a week
where they spend the time in
the maternity department
watching babies being born.

“You can watch a movie, see
a video, you can read about it in
books, but unless you’re there
and appreciate the total envi-
ronment — well, that’s a miracle
every day,” Wedge said. “That’s
probably the most amazing
thing students go away with.”

Throughout the semester the
students observe and are
instructed on coaching proce-
dures and assisting deliveries.
By the end of the term, students
take a very active role through-
out the process, mainly through
giving support and helping with
proper breathing techniques to
the laboring mother.

“Maternal nursing is fascinat-
ing and a very interesting area
in which to teach,” she said.

“Seeing” babies born was
beautiful and she helped us
really understand what we saw
in clinical, lecture and reading
materials. She puts it all togeth-
er and makes it easier,” said
Carissa Gibson, one of Wedge’s
junior nursing students last
semester.

Wedge also instructs a basic
skills course for nursing stu-
dents in a laboratory fully
equipped with dummies in hos-
pital bed settings to practice
procedures such as bed bathing
and intravenous injections.
Students receive hands—on
experience in this course, some-
thing not all universities offer in
nursing programs.

Wedge, who is interested in
learning and retaining strate-
gies, said that students in med-
ical fields today must absorb a
massive amount of information.

“If I look back on what I
needed to know as an under-
graduate in nursing at
Duquesne University compared
to what undergraduates today
need to know, there’s so much
more known, so much more
information,” she said. “How
does one get that information
into some manageable structure
that can be retained, used and
remembered’ That’s what really
interests me.”

She tried many learning
strategies as an undergraduate
and as a graduate student. She
obtained her master’s in educa-
tion, also from Duquesne, and a
master’s in family nursing from
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. At that point she
began to believe technology
was the key.

To make the learning process
a little easier for students she
designed a computer disk that
allows students to practice
proper locations for injections
in the body. The disk is now
being introduced in Canada and
at other universities in the coun-
try.

Barbara Loedding, a senior
nursing ‘student, said, “She was
always so enthusiastic in class
and eager to help us outside of
class. She told us stories about
others and herself in labor and
that made it easier to relate to
things.”

Wedge said she believes in
universal health care and is a
consultant to the World Health
Organization (WHO).

With this group, she collects
recently outdated books on
health care from Pitt faculty and
elsewhere to send to Guyana,
an English speaking country in
South America. Because of
Guyana’s location, English lan-

of “good old boy" politics,
problems with the economy
and the school system will
be manageable.

Murphy and Wagner
blamed the economic prob-
lem on each other.

“if we could get a regional
tax base like Legislator
Murphy was able to get for
Philadelphia, we could bring
$120 million back into this
city,” Wagner said.

“There was no local lead-
ership for a tax base to
work,” Murphy said.

Murphy then posed a
question of why the head of
City Council, Wagner, would
not do something about the
problem of public housing.

“This city is the largest
landlord around, and if we

work with Housing
and Urban Development
committees in Harrisburg
we can build responsible
housing projects,” Murphy
said.

Wagner said he believes
not enough has been done
in Harrisburg.

“I say wake up in
Harrisburg,” Wagner said
addressing Murphy. “It’s
time for Pittsburgh to get
what Philadelphia does.”

At the end of the debate all
candidates asked each other
questions. While Murphy
and Wagner picked at
each other, Matta addressed
the other two democra-
tic candidates by asking
if they will come in the last
15 debates with some forti-
tude.

Varsity

Continued from page 6
I schools by The Chronicle of Higher
Education, Pitt fell below the national
numbers released by the NCAA in
February 1992.

0 Pitt currently has 11 male varsity
sports and eight female varsity sports.

0 Pitt’s percentage of athletes, 75.7
percent men to 24.3 percent women,
was off the national mark of 71 percent
men, 29 percent women.

-Pitt spent $1,668,308 on men’s
scholarships (74.9 percent) and
$559,281 (25.1 percent) on women.
Nationally, schools spent 72 percent on
men and 28 percent on women’s schol-
arships.

-Pitt’s total recruiting cost was
$402,840 for men (95.3 percent) and
$26,340 for women (4.7 percent).

0 The Chronicle reported that Pitt
spent $6,170,295 (97.2 percent) on
men’s athletic operating cost and
$179,010 (3.8 percent on women).

Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes dis-
putes these numbers and said that
there was an error in the report. He
said Pitt is closer to spending 87 per-
cent on men and 13 percent on
women. The national average is 80 per-
cent men and 20 percent women.

-Pitt spends approximately $25,900
per male varsity athlete and $8,173 per
female varsity athlete.

In the battle for gender equity, these
figures are about the only thing the
women’s lacrosse team and other
women athletes at Pitt who are being
deprived of competing on a varsity
level have on their side.

“We’re not spending the same
amount of money on men as women
and I don’t know any schools that are,”
Jaynes said.

Compared to other Division I schools
in major athletic conferences, Pitt
scores poorly. Ohio State University, a
member of the Big Ten conference,

had a better showing in The Chronlcleir
survey. Although its number of partici-
pants, 73.7 percent men to 26.3 percent
women, was not much better than
Pitt’s, OSU’s spending was much closer
to the requirements of Title D(.

-OSU spent 35.7 percent on
women’s scholarships compared to
Pitt’s 25.1 percent.

-OSU spent nearly 24 percent on
women’s operating costs compared to
Pitt’s claimed 13 percent.

Both Penn State University and
Temple University, state—funded
Division I schools, did not participate
in The Chronlcle’$ report because they
wanted to protect sensitive information
about coaching salaries.

Pitt’s percentage of male athletes,
compared to the total male population
on campus, is out of proportion as
well. The report, submitted in 1992,
stated that there were 6,925 undergrad-
uate men and 6,574 undergrad women

In order to meet Division-I criteria, a
school must offer seven sports for both
men and women. Next year, though, in
order to promote equity, Division I will
require six men’s sports and eight
women’s sports to meet its require-
ments. ‘

“I’m going to do everything I can to
provide for the greatest opportunity in
all sports,” Jaynes said. “Both males
and females should have a quality

The universities of Pittsburgh and Arizona are once again being"
linked together by the media. Only this time, the news doesn’t
concern Mt. Graham and the red squirrel. And, unlike the tele-
scope issue, Pitt should imitate this brand of leadership provided
by the University of Arizona and its President Manuel Pachecl.

We are not necessarily speaking of Arizona’s ability to keep
tuition-raises at 0 percent for the 1991-’92 school year. Although it
would be nice to see the same thing happen here at Pitt. The pri-
orities of the University of Arizona and the University of
Pittsburgh are two entirely separate issues and should not be
compared. ’

What we are speaking of is President Pachecl’s hegemony in
reaching out to students for more than just their wallets. He has
actively encouraged student participation in the budgetary
process. And he even went so far as to allow students to vote on
the proposed tuition increase for the ‘92-’93 school year. The stu-
dents, by the way, voted overwhelmingly in favor of it.

There is no doubt that such an exercise is more a practice of
symbolism than it is a substantial exercise of power. University
administrators have both the resources and knowledge available
to convince students quite easily. Even so, giving students the
image that they areactively participating in the process is worthy
in itself.

The University of Pittsburgh would be wise to reach out to its
student constituents. Tuition fees contribute 49 percent of the uni-
versity’s budget, and students should have some say about where
thisjrnoney is spent. For the reasons mentioned above, basic rep-
resentation like what exists now is not the answer.

Student Government Board would also be wise to yield some of
its power and hire a professional lobbyist to represent student
interests in Harrisburg. Students pay a lot of money in fees, and
finally the SGB has a real chance to make a difference.

The Messiah

Forty—eight  One day longer than the war in Iraq. That’s how
long the Waco wacko David Koresh has been able to avoid the
efforts of federal investigators to deliver him to the promised land -
prison. I

Ninety adults and 17 children are still held captive of the 77—acre
Mt. Cara1nel‘com‘pound. ‘Koresh, the leader of a group knownas the-
Branch Davidians, claims several women as his wives, and it has
been reported that he frequently engages in sexual acts with chil-
dren.

To halt these repulsive acts, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol and
Tobacco and Firearms has attempted everything from lightly armed
attacks to blinding spotlights to booming Buddhist chants. The
attempts of federal officials to end this struggle have not conveyed a
coherent sense of purpose but, on the contrary, a slight sense of
amateurishness and futility.

Thus far, his punishment has been unspeakable. Koresh has been
on the front page of almost every major newspaper and magazine in
the country. He has been the subject of numerous talk shows, and
every major producer in Hollywood is frothing at the mouth to get
this guy’s story. Amy Fisher move over.

It’s no wonder that the media is fighting over this story. Only in the
United States can someone kidnap 100 people, kill four others,
molest little children and get a multimillion dollar movie contract to
show for it. After all, that’s what people want to see, isn’t it?

Basic economic theory states that the more a firm proﬁts, the more
prone it is to increasing competition. In other words, by rewarding
these freaks, Hollywood and the media are only encouraging more"
individuals to enter the market, and, ultimately, commit more
unspeakable acts.

Learning how to talk politics is an art

Political doublespeczle sometimes confuses the best of ’em

The passion play known as poli-
tics is an entertaining and exciting
drama. More hard—hitting than foot-
ball, more unpredictable than the
NCAA Tournament, it’s the best
spectator sport around. Most
Americans claim to hate it The fact
is, however, that they ﬁnd political
gamesmanship as interesting as sex
(for Messers, Packwood and
Kennedy, they’re one and the
same).

There is a problem with the
worid of political discourse — you
can’t understand what‘s happening
by taking things at face value. The
trick is to get a feel for uncovering
hidden meanings. Once you ﬁgure
this out, you’ll gain a greater under-
standing of the whole political
scene. No matter how much you
like a politico, be it Clinton or
Buckley, blindly accepting what a
politician says makes you a pawn in
a great chess match. And who
wants that?

With the presidential election still
fresh in our minds, those who har-
bor presidential aspirations are a
logical group with which to begin.
Since their penchant for doubles-
peak is well—known, their state-
ments are the easiest for the novice
to decipher.

. We begin with potential
Republican candidate for the White
House, Wﬂlianr Bennet, since he
and Jack Kemp are the leading can-
didates for their party’s nomination
in ‘96. His remarks were made at
the National Reviews Conservative
Summit —

What he said: “For the last 20
years, lots of people have been hav-
ing a ﬁeld day making fun of Ozzie
and Harriet. As a result, 50 percent
of marriages in our country end in
divorce.”

What he meant: “Sure, I’rn smart
enough to know that pointing ﬁn-
gers won’t lead to any change in the
divorce rate. But, if it’s what my fel-
low right-wingers want to hmr, then
who am I to refuse? Besides, when
did a careful and objective analysis
of an issue get someone votes?”

Populist billionaire and full-time
curmudgeon H. Ross Perot to the

Ameriom public.

What he said: “Watch Congress:
they talk about saving but all the do
is spend  they treat money like it

falls out of the sky. But it comes

from hard-working people.”

What he meant: “Hey! Hey,
America!!! It’s me! H. Ross Perot!!!
Remember me?! I’m still here! Hey!
Where are yfall goin’ now?! Don’t
you know who I am?! H. Ross
Perot! H. R—O-S-S P;-E—R-O—T! You
can’t just walk away from me! Hey

Shawn
McClearn

 waita minute! HEY!!!”

The highest echelons of govern-
ment service also provide an ample
supply of glibness.

Secretary of Defense Les Aspin,
offering his assessment of recent
proposals for cuts in the defense
budget, to 7imeMagazine.

What he said: “Some of the big.

changes in the former Soviet Union
are irreversible. For now, we can
continue bringing down defense
_ What he meant: “What was that
Senator Nunn’ You say you’re con-
cerned that the Clinton
Administration is cutting too much
toosoon9Areyousureallofyour
blustering has nothing to do with
the fact that I’m defense secretary
and you’re not? It’s not my fault that
President Clinton likes me better.
Suck it up Sammy! Suck it up!”

The world of international rela-
tions is famous for its duplicitous
statements. Just ask an expert.

Oded Ben Anri, prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin’s media advisor,
speaking to the Clm'st-tan Science
Monitor on his boss’ behalf about
prospects for peace in the Middle
East

What he said- “Things are moving
positively ahead with the Syrians,
less so with the Palestinians  We
really hope that we will achieve an
agreement with Syria by the end of
this year or the beginning of 1994.”

What he meant “Yassir who? Oh!
Oh yealﬂ You mean the schmudc

who runs the PLO! Well, he’d rather
pout and let Hamas run roughshod
through the occupied tern'torics, so
we’ve decided to go over his head.
Keep pouting Yassir! We don’t
need you anymore. _It looks like
Syria is giving us what we want,
and as they go on this, so goes
Jordan. You and your little dog-
and-pony act are old news pal!
Seeee ya!”

Of course, sometimes all you
have to do is look out into your
own backyard to ﬁnd what you’re
looking for.

Pitt Business and Finance Vice
Chancellor Ben Tuchi talking about
Pitt’s involvement with the highly
controversial Mt Graham Telescope
Project

What he said: ‘”Ihe only tie [to Mr.
Graham] would be in the sense of
our academic community being
aware of the project or ﬁnding it
interesting. But as for speciﬁc ties,
none.”

What he meant: “We [the admin-
istrationl want to have it both ways.
On the one hand, we want to
remain involved in developing this
project because if it goes through it
means big bucks and even bigger

. accolades for the university. On the

other hand, well, normally we
would just say ‘squirrel, schmine1!:‘
Unfortunately, those meddling
SEAC" kids have made this whole
affair a PR free-for—all. So now we’ve
got to make nice and feign concern
for the environment. Damn tree-
huggers!”

Get the picture? Use these exam-
ples as a guide to deciphering the
mysterious language of politics. In

no time at all, you’ll be able to ﬁg-

ure out what’s really being said In
fact, I encourage all of you to sub-
mit your own analyses of this phe-
nomenon to your political science
professors and Me Pitt News for
review. It’ll earn brownie you points
with your professors and give me
plenty of new material for my next
column. Until next time

Tuition

Continued from page 1
On the West Coast, universities are
experiencing‘ similar tuition increases
that have forced the administrations to

find ways to cut costs.

At the state-supported University of
California-Berkeley, Administrative
Analyst Russell Low said, “We have had
cutbacks and we even have had layoffs.
We have tried to avoid this, but it’s

unavoidable.

There, the tuition for full-time, tinder-
graduate California residents has risen
from $1,381 in 1985 to $4,334 in 1993;

an increase of $1,899.
According to Low, next year’s tuition
is expected to increase by 32 percent,
or $1,054. This is far above the national
average.
This increase, said Low, is a result of
increased costs and decreased state

allocations.
At the beginning of the 1991-’92
school year, Berkeley students have
also had to pay a mandatory health
insurance fee of $358. This also con-
tributes to the increased tuition rate.

of Arizona was suppressed for two
years, according to Frank Antinoro, the
associate director in the Office of
Institutional Research, next year’s
tuition is expected to rise by 6.4 per-
cent, or $250.

Many adjustments had to be made
during 1991-93 to compensate for the
decreased revenue. Hiring and salary
freezes were included in these adjust-
ments as well as the elimination of aca-
demic programs.

But, according to Dr. Betsy Porter,
Pitt's director of Admissions and

Financial Aid, it is our programs and
faculty that enhance our institution.
“The sheer depth and level of cur-

mitment make this institution a real
special place,” Porter .said. “For a state-
related institution, it has a special
ambiance that is attractive to the stu-
dent population.”

Will this tuition trend continue?

“It looks like it will continue at least
for the next year because budgets are
pretty awful. Then hopefully it will get
better, but who knows,” Low said.

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

After suffering through a fatal
late-season shooting slump this
past season, the Pitt Panthers
basketball team took measures
to try and prevent the same thing
from happening again. ‘

A consistent outside threat has
been priority number one for
Paul Evans this offseason, and
with the recruiting season quick-
ly winding to a close, his prayers
may have finally been answered.

Sotiris Aggelou, a 6-foot 3-
inch, 180-pound shooting guard
from Riverside High School in
Ellwood City, has signed a letter
of intent to play his college bas-
ketball at Pitt.

Aggelou, a three-point shoot-
ing specialist, averaged 25.1
points and 5.5 rebounds for
Riverside in his first and only
season of high school competi-
tion in the United States. In addi-
tion to Pitt, other schools that
recruited Aggelou included
Boston College, Villanova,
Georgetown, Penn State,
Temple, Seton Hall and Kansas.

Aggelou hit 47.5 percent of his
field goal attempts. Impressive
considering almost half of those
were from three-point range. He
connected on 66 of 180 treys (37
percent) and also shot 75 percent
from the free—throw line.

Aggelou, who hails from
Greece, came to the United
States in September after Gus
Sariandes, athletic director at the
American School in Athens,

Aggelouﬁlls pa. longrange need    S

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News
Sotiris Aggelou brings athletic ability as well as outside

shooting to the Pitt basketball program.

Greece contacted Metro Index
scout Joe Butler about sending
Aggelou to participate in the
prestigious Metro Index
Basketball Camp in California,
Pa. ,

Aggelou could have stayed in
Greece and played professional-
ly but instead chose to play col-
legiate basketball in America.
The Metro Index camp marked
the beginning of his quest.

“He played extremely well,”
Butler said. “His forte is his abili-
ty to shoot the three-point jump
shot. He can shoot it off the drib-
ble. He can shoot it right off the
catch, which is a very difficult
thing for a high school kid.”

Butler describes Aggelou as an
all-around athlete with a body
thathas potential to add more
weight and strength. According
to Butler, Aggelou also possesses

the necessary quickness to
defend quicker guards in the Big
East Conference. It was no secret
that Pitt was desperate for a
shooter, and that helped make
the Panthers attractive.

“I just try to do my best, that’s
all,” Aggelou said. “T hey’re look-
ing for a shooter. I'll try and do
my best.”

“He can shoot, that’s his forte,”

Pitt honors outgoing senior athletes

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

,Excellence in tradition and athletics were
upheld last night at the annual Pitt Senior
Awards Banquet last night.

The banquet, held in the William Pitt
Union, honored 88 graduating senior ath-
letes for their hard work and dedication to
Pitt and the particular sport they were
involved in.

According to Director of Athletics Oval
Jaynes, participating in athletics at Pitt has
prepared students to perform exceptionally
well in whatever they choose to do when
they graduate.

“You have a great foundation in your
future,” Jaynes said. “Challenge yourselves
to be the best you can, be a builder in your
community.”

Many awards were presented to the
seniors. All graduating participants of varsity
sports were presented with gold watches as
tokens of appreciation for their dedication to
Pitt athletics.

The graduating seniors were all given hon-
orary one—year memberships to the Pitt

Golden Panthers and the Varsity Letter Club.

The annual Panther Awards were present-
ed to Women’s Track and Field athlete
Ronise Crumpler and Pitt quarterback Alex
Van Pelt. Crumpler is a two—time All-America
sprinter who holds 12 Pitt school records.
Van Pelt finished. hiscareer at Pitt as the
third leading passer in NCAA history. _

The award is presented to the graduating
male and female senior athletes who have
attained outstanding athletic achievement
and have donethe most to promote the best
interest of intercollegiate athletics at Pitt.

Van Pelt said that the most important mem—
ory he will take with him is not a football
game that he played in but something relat-
ed to athletics off the field.

“The most memorable thing that I will take
with me is the friendships I made here at
Pitt,” Van Pelt said. “Knowing we can lean
on each other in times of need is much more
important.

The Blue Gold Award was presented to
men’s swimmer Don Boyd, who is currently
the Pitt and Big East record holder in the

100- and 200-yard breaststrokes, and 1993

Pitt crew club row

By Jack Becker
For The Pitt News

As students across the Pitt
campus prepare themselves
for the upcoming week of
finals, the members of the
men’s and women’s rowing
teams are also preparing
themselves for finals of a dif-

ferent sort — the finals at
the 55th annual Dad Vail
Regatta.

The regatta, which will be
held on May 9 in
Philadelphia, is, essentially,
the Eastern Collegiate
Championships in rowing.

The team took a step in
that direction on Saturday at
the LaSalle invitational in
Camden, N.]. The field at
LaSa1le has been scaled
down this year to six
schools: Pitt, Washington St.,

Stockton St., University of
Delaware, Drexel and host
LaSalle. The Panthers had a
strong showing overall and
captured one first—place fin-
ish (the men’s pairs) and
three second-place finishes
(the men’s lightweight four,

the women’s varsity four and

the women’s varsity light-
weight eight).

The lone first—place’finish
for Pitt was accomplished by
Curt Miller and John
Whiteford. The entries in the
men’s pairs event were
allowed to take a “floating
start,” meaning they didn’t
have to come to a dead stop
at the starting line, which
was to the liking of the Pitt
duo.

“We jumped off the line
pretty quickly,” Miller said.
“Coach [Mary Gottl told us to

S IOWZII’

stay close for the first 1,000
meters and at that point to
take a power-20.”

The power—20 that Miller is
speaking of means that the
duo is supposed to dig out
20 strong strokes in succes-
sion in order to either pull
away from or catch up to the
rest of the field. At the
1,500-meter mark, which is
where the boats begin to
sprint, Miller and Whiteford
had close to a two lengths
lead on Washington St.

“We weren’t quite as tech-
nically efficient as we could
have been, but we did what
we’ wanted to do,” Miller
said.

“We’ve been working
together since spring break,”
Whiteford said. “We have a
lot of power in the boat, but
it’s not as clean as we would

like it to be. We’re working
on our steering. We’re not
completely in sync yet.

“Rowing is 100 percent
teamwork,‘ which makes it a
different kind of team sport.
If you’re not 100 percent in
sync you’re not going to be
successful.”

If Miller and Whiteford
aren’t totally cohesive right
now, they certainly have all
the ingredients it takes to get
there. Both men are 6-feet 2-_
inches tall and both weigh
approximately 195 pounds.
The closer in dimensions
that rowers in the same boat
are to each other the easier

_ it is for them to get their

strokes together.

“His [Miller] arms are
almost the same size as mine
and his legs are almost the
same size as mine so it

works well for us when try-
ing to stay together,”
Whiteford said.

The tandem has had expe-
rience rowing together in the
past as well. Last year, they
raced in the men’s novice
four boat. Another thing in
their favor is the fact that
they are only sophomores
and still have two more
years to improve.

“We get along so well,”
Miller said, “which is very
important, too.”

Miller and Whiteford are
looking to make their mark
at Dad Vail, but they aren’t
the only ones with their eyes
on a medal. The women’s

Noll skips Disneyworld trip, teaches championship style

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

After winning four Super
Bowls, Chuck Noll did not
travel to Florida’s
Disneyworld every time his
Pittsburgh Steelers won. Noll
did not have to face the
insanity of four trips to
Mickey’s home. He was too
busy.

In his 39 years of profes-
sional football, the former
Steeler coach/legend was
always coaching, always
preparing and always in a
hurry to get work done.

But after his retirement in
1991, Noll had time to relax
and look back. But even
while relaxing, Noll did not
get too far away from the
game he loves.

“I met more people in the
last year than all the 23 years
I was here [in Pittsburgh],”
Noll said. “Retirement is
wonderful.”

While enjoying the time
off, Noll has travelled to

took first place in their event
at the Occaquan Regatta
back on March 28th.

Janinne Markizon, who is
one of the older members of
the team, said she has a lot
of confidence in her boat as
well heading into the Dad
Vail Regatta.

“The lightweight eight
[second place at LaSallel
should do very well,” she
said.

Although a medal at Dad
Vail is the final objective,
the team has a meet (April
24 at the Southerns
Invitational) sandwiched
between now and then, so
Miller and his partner
Whiteford, like the rest of
the crew team, will take it
one stroke at a time.

Europe and Japan. But his
overseas escapades often
involved football.

“The NFL asked me to put
on a clinic for Japanese
coaches,” Noll said. “I also
put on clinics in Europe.
Schools over there [in
Europe] don’t sponsor sports
teams.”

The NFL sent the right
coach to teach the Japanese
and Europeans the basics.
The basics of football was
Chuck Noll’s creed while
coaching the Steelers and
still is even in retirement.

“Whenever we [the
Steelers] strayed from the
basics, we lost,” Noll said.
“If we did things fundamen-
tally sound, we were suc-
cessful.”

Noll said he “lived and
died” by the basics, and in
explaining his teachings, he
described the fundamental
process of making a tackle.

“Winning the battle of hit-
ting is a basic,” Noll said.
“You have to come down

low and strike a rising blow
to re-direct the force. You
can judge who wins the bat-
tle of hitting by the sudden
stop.”

But teaching the art of
tackling, domestic and
abroad, is only one part of
Noll’s method to making a
winner on the field.

“Teaching football is get-
ting into the minds of the
players,” Noll said. “The
mind is like a swimming
pool. It is lovely when you
have nice, clean water. But
sunshine creates algae and
soon you have a cesspool.

“You have to put a little
chlorine in, not a lot,” Noll
said. “It is a struggle to keep
pure water in the mind. You
must rid the mind of nega-
tive thoughts to be success-
ful.”

Knowing the basics helps
to keep the mind pure. Noll
said he realized that and was
a hands-on teacher on the
practice field — the place
where Noll has seen his

work pay off.

While working on the pass
rush technique with his
defensive line years ago,
Noll’s teachings were slow in
showing results.

On one particular play,
however, a young defensive
lineman knocked over his
apparent blocker and was in
the backfield before he
knew what he had done.

Instead of tackling some-
body, the wide-eyed player
turned around to Noll and
looked as if to say, “Where
did you get that lmovel?”

The player learned the
basics and Noll said he was
proud.

“Those are the kind of
things that are super,” Noll
said of his defensive lineman
and his practice success.

“You got to focus on the
‘What to do’ and ‘How to do
it,’” Noll said. “On the foot-
ball field you have an
assignment, this is your job.
But you also have the tech-
nique that goes into how to

do the job.”

Using these rules as major
keys to success, Noll said
winning will come first, fol-
lowed by the fun of the
game.

“Fun is knowing how to do
it [the technique] and having
success doing it too,” Noll
said.

If those teachings get
through to the eager stu-
dents in Japan and Europe,
Noll might create another
football dynasty in another
country — truly an historical
event

But for now, Noll’s coach-
ing will remain in a foreign
land. He likes watching the
NFL and the Steelers in
retirement.

“I found out how much fun
it was to be a fan,” Noll said.
“If there is a good play, you
get to cheer.”

While he is not watching
football on TV or in person
(Noll was at this year’s Super
Bowl), he likes to relax on

Here goes. Beyond the fact
that Reggie White is the best

(arguably the best defender,
period), he is also the biggest
name available in the first year
of the NFL’s new free—agent pol-
icy. That alone makes his huge

fied.
