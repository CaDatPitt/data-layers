Students discover
ocal woman's
body in tunnel

Anne Estonilo

 

The body of a 45-year-old white female, found on the
railroad tracks in Bellefield late Friday night, has been’
identiﬁed by authorities.

Janla Carr of Oakland was found near the entrance to a
train tunnel at the intersection of Neville and Boundary
streets. According to the police report, “she was wearing a
grey sweatshirt and burgundy sweatpants, and [lying] on
the railroad tracks a short distance into the tunnel.” Her
right leg had been severed by a passing train.

The county coroner’s office said that Carr died of blunt
force trauma to the chest and torso.

There was no sign of rape.

T‘wo Pitt students, Miguel Llinas, Jr., 19, and Charles
Kamzelski, 20, found the body while taking a walk Friday
night around 11:15.

Llinas said he and Karnzelski were walking down a hill
next to the bridge connecting Pitt’s campus to Phipps
Conservatory grounds and the Schenley Park area, when
they saw the train tunnel. According to the police report,
the two said they smelled sulfur coming from the tunnel.

Pro-choice escorts lead
patients through protesters
at local abortion clinics  

 
   

.->552:-. zit-: . .>.<':«:

Abortion is not just a social issue. And it wasn’t for social rea-
sons that Pitt students gathered in the cold early morning air out-
side a local abortion clinic on Saturday morning.

Members of Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization gather
weekly to volunteer for the Pittsburgh Pro-Choice escorts, a group
that guides women safely through crowds of pro-life supporters
into the Women’s Health Services Clinic. The Health Services
Clinic is a site of daily demonstrations by pro—life activists because,
among its various services, the clinic performs abortions.

The volunteers, who wear easily identiﬁable, bright yellow T-
shirts that read “Pro-Choice Escort,” guide patients into the clinic
by escorting them through swarms of pro—life supporters. The pro-
life supporters are often chanting prayers, trying to speak with
patients before they enter, and waving pamphlets that depict abort-
ed 21 -week-old fetuses.

“We have every right to ﬁght for our freedom, and these pro-
testors are oppressive,” said Margot Douaihy, escort and co—presi-
dent of CW 0. “These pro-life activists are so convinced that
they’fe right, they’re willing to harass people to change their

Joe C usick vows a successful return from rehab

Marc Nuzzo
-‘ . 13:? ‘,3. . . .

:-

After a term wrought with prob-
lems of alcoholism and rehabilitation, a
city official said he will try to putthe
past behind him and move on with his
job — if he gets the chance.

The past several months have not
been easy for Pittsburgh City
Councilman Joe Cusick. In late
December, Cusick entered alcohol
rehabilitation for the fourth time. It was
the third time he has entered rehab
since 1994, when he was sworn into
office.

He emerged from the experience
last week more calm and at ease than
the clips of him which ﬂashed on the
television reports just weeks ago. In an
exclusive interview, Cusick explained
how he is now ready to tackle the polit-
ical issues he temporarily left behind
during his time in rehab.

“There’s been some senior issues
that haven’t been completed yet, and
I’d like to complete those and really
just get back to the real basis of this
job,” said Cusick. “And that is to pro-
vide consistent service.”

Joe and the Alcoholic

Sitting among the photos of his fam-
ily, smiling constituents, and fellow
politicians that clutter his desk and office
walls, Cusick spoke of his efforts to put
the past behind him, get on with his life,
and make the most with the rest of his
time as a councilman.

Pausing to reﬂect on the “personal
tribulations” of the past month in partic-
ular, Cusick said that he is sorry for his
actions. Making no excuses for what he
had already done, he instead went on to
say that he intends to persist and move
forward for the rest of his term.

He said that though he governs the
fourth district, he is always keeping an
eye on all the operations in the city.
Cusick’s district includes a southern sec-
tion of the city including Bon Air,
Banksville, and Carrick.

But recently, his job hasn’t been the
only thing on his mind.

Cusick faces a court decision tomor-
row to see if he may keep his job as a
councilman. It is'a decision he said he
faces with apprehension and a degree of
faith that people will give him one last
chance to do his job.

home, slowly recovers from
bypass surgery in Russia

Around the World

MOSCOW — Boris Yeltsin is still
working from home as he recovers.
Over the weekend, he had meetings at
his country home with his top aide and
Russia’s foreign minister. Yesterday,
he was to meet with French President
Jacques Chirac at his home as well.
On Thursday, the Russian
President _was seen on television for
the first time in weeks. Although he
was hunched over slightly, he was
smiling and walking easily during a
meeting with the chairman of Russia’s
Constitutional Court. There is great
speculation in Russia that this meeting
was the first step in trying to change
the constitution so that it will be easi-
er for Yeltsin to choose his own suc-
cessor if he steps down due to poor
health. However, his doctors still say
that they expect the 66-year-old
Yeltsin to make a full recovery from
pneumonia and a quintuple heart
bypass surgery. Associated Press.

BOGOTA, -Colombia — Authorities
shut down a major drug laboratory
that is capable of producing over 300
tons of pure cocaine in a year — half
of the total amount of cocaine shipped
to the U.S. from Colombia in a year.
When 50 police commandos dropped
from helicopters to a jungle area in the
state of Guaviarc, they found and
seized eight tons of pure cocaine at the
lab. No arrests were made because the
workers ﬂed before police landed.
“The losses for the traffickers are
incalculable,” said Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano, Colombian national police
director. “We’re very pleased to
improve the country’s image.” U.S.
officials provide Serrano and the anti-

drug police with equipment and intel-
ligence. Despite C.olombia’s political
and judicial systems being tainted
with drug corruption, U.S. officials
have nothing but praise for Serrano
and his squad. Associated Press.

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON — “Blood pinnings”
by an elite paratrooper unit are being
investigated by the Marine Corps.
This came after the bloody hazing
incidents were shown on “Dateline
NBC.” The pins that the troops won
for completing 10 successfultraining
jumps were beaten into their chests in
a bizarre hazing ritual performed by
more experienced paratroopers. A mil-
itary source who viewed the tapes
called the incidents “sickening.”
Associated Press.

ATGLEN, Pa. -— He didn’t become a
crack dealer until he was 75, but now
William H. “Dusty” Miller has been
convicted on drug charges and faces
more charges for selling crack
cocaine. He commanded 174 soldiers
in World War II, but in August of
1995, when he was offered a way to
make easy money, he jumped on it.
After picking up a shipment of crack
cocaine from a tree stump, Miller sped
home. That was his mistake. When the
police pulled him over for speeding,
they found 121 bags of crack and hun-
dreds of dollars.

Lancaster County authorities say
that Miller isn’t the typical
drug dealer that they arrest. “This is
usually a crime for people in their 20s
and 30s,” said prosecutor Brian
Chudzick. “Afterthat, they usually
straighten up.” Associated Press.

Body

“[Kamzelski] said ‘Hey, there’s a
tunnel. Let’s check it out.’ and pulled
out a ﬂashlight,” said Llinas. “We
walked in and then I said, ‘Hey look,
Chuck, it’s a body.”’

Llinas said Kamzclski didn’t
believe him at first, but when he moved
up closer he moaned at the sight.

“I know what I saw. I saw two
parts. An arm and a leg. The arm was
attached,” Llinas said. “I was thinking a
million different things. I was com-
pletely shocked.”

The two then walked up Filmore
Street and on to South Craig Street

where they hailed a CMU police car.

A Dan Bendick, CSX Terminal
Trainmaster, stated in the police report
that the last train came on the tracks at
11:15 p.m. Bendick said yesterday that
the case was still under investigation,
and all he knew about the incident was
that Carr had died from a blunt force.

Pittsburgh Zone 6 Police handled
the case but said no further information
has been received.

Funeral arrangements will be run
through Sauvageot Metropolitan
Funeral Home. Services have not yet
been scheduled.

Cusick

“In whatever endeavor I should
choose to take on,  I think people look
at Joe and are able to differentiate
between Joe and that alcoholic,” said
Cusick. “My hopes are that this will
come out in this panel.”

And he said he thinks they will.
Cusick maintains his problems have
made him stronger.

“I’m going to pray that I can ﬁnish
my term, but I think the real win will be
that I’ll be able to see some of my weak-
nesses and, over the next 11 months, try
to build on them,” said Cusick.

Cusick said he thinks people are
able to distinguish between himself and
his problem. Cusick made it clear, sever-
al times, that he sees his problem as a
formidable obstacle, but not an impossi-
ble one, which he can overcome while
still performing his job well.

“Can I be upset about what hap-
pened? Sure. But where is that going to
get me? Probably back to the same point
I was, and I don’t want to be there [any]
more.” _

When asked if he felt public ser-
vants should be held to any lesser level
of responsibility for their actions, Cusick
simply replied, “No.”

Creating Enthusiasm and a Sense of
Direction

Cusick would not go into the details
of his rehabilitation, but said it is a
process that he will have to work on for
the rest of his life.

He went on to say that his experi-
ence last month has given him the tools
and chance to look at what the differ-
ences between sobriety and the life of an
alcoholic are.

“Now I get to make a choice. This is
about Joe.  This isn’t about whether I
can do a job. There are a lot of function-
ing alcoholics out there. This is about
me, and it’s about my health, my physi-
cal and my emotional well—being. This
doesn’t make me a bad person trying to
get good, it makes me a sick person try-
ing to get well. That’s what the people
need to understand.”

Cusick’s voice faded nearly to a
whisper as he said that said he thinks he
has hit his bottom and that he will recov-
er, “God willing.”

He said he still believes he has the
support and respect of his colleagues on
City Council. He credited his staff for
their outstanding research and said he
never enters the council’s chambers
without a well researched argument
because of their hard work.

“I’m not going to allow people to
take the last three years of [work my
staff and I have done] and throw that
away,” said Cusick. “I’ll be damned if
I’m going to let that happen.”

He firmly stated he will not allow
himself to be any less of a force to be
reckoned with on council.

“If they are concerned about Joe
Cusick, then their priorities are a little

messed up,” he said as he quickly
glanced to where the City of Pittsburgh,
State of Pennsylvania, and United
States’ ﬂags stood behind his desk. He
faced forward again with a look of deter-
mination in his eyes.

“When people get into a ﬁght with
Joe Cusick, they know that I’ll go all the
way to the wall with them,” he said. He
also said that his ability to ﬁght for leg-
islation is what his constituents believe
in the most.

“I am the type of person that is able
to scream enthusiasm over certain types
of legislation,” said Cusick, referring to
the “Neighborhood Schools” program
he argued to its passage in the State
House.

Cusick leaned back in his chair and
crossed his arms as he explained why he
thinks he is still capable of doing a good
job, despite the problems he has faced.

“It takes someone who has experi-
ence  in council, and that’s what I can
provide for the next 11 months here,”
said Cusick.

“I like to look at myself as being
somewhat of a leader in getting [into] the
community, creating enthusiasm, creat-
ing direction, and giving them a sense of
hope,” he said. He then told of how he
had rallied over 700 parents to march for
the “Neighborhood Schools” program
he had just spoken of.

Cusick said that his community is as
much a part of him and his success as
anything else, inspiring him and making
his legislation a reality.

“I think people have that conﬁdence,
that reassurance that I’ll be there for
them, good or ba ,” said Cusick. “And
that’s what I think I am able to bring to
[my district].”

Cusick has pressed several pieces of
legislation through the State House in his
three years in ofﬁce, but he cited the city
youth curfew he passed last November
as “by far” his best ﬁght.

“The curfew was exciting to work
on,” he said. “I was able to change the
president of council’s mind in some
regard. That alone is a feat.”

Figureheads, Officials, and Leaders

Cusick paused and looked at some
of the photos on his wall. He opened his
mouth to talk, but hesitated for a
moment. He looked back to his hands
resting on the table before him and then
spoke.

“It’s unfortunate that the media can
take a person and take all of the good out
of them. People need to recognize that
we as ﬁgureheads, as public officials, as
leaders, also have problems and we have
to count on others to help us,” said
Cusick.

“I need to know that there are people
out there to help me too, personally, pro-
fessionally, and emotionally,” said
Cusick. “The best thing I can do is work
on my character defects. Does that make
me a bad person? I don’t think so.”

mind.”

The scene last Saturday, in front of the
clinic, was chaotic. Escorts lined the side-
walks for three city blocks while pro—life
activists gathered behind a barricade in front
of the clinic. Neither side was allowed to
cross the wooden barricade that is placed 10
feet from the clinic door.

The single common thread between the
two groups is the desire to be the ﬁrst to
reach patients approaching the clinic.

‘The rules are this,” said Paula Harris,
captain of the team of escorts. “You don’t
touch the patients. You walk up to them and
say, ‘Hi. I’m with the clinic. I can walk you
to the door.’ You nwd to talk very softly so
they focus only on your voice, and they look
only at you.”

Susie Fisher, coordinator of pro-choice
escorts, said the the experience can often be
overwhelming for patients.

“You have to be the calm one they see
when they get out of the car,” said Fisher.

Patients of the clinic are easily spotted
because most pedestrians not entering the
clinic cross the street to avoid the demon-
strations. Those entering the clinic are usual-
ly surrounded by a group of friends or walk
with a partner.

Some arrive in tears, others stare
straight ahead, but all walk quickly.

Throughout the morning, escorts were
continually approached by demonstrators
who tried to either provoke debates or con-
verse. The majority of the 25 anti—abortion
activists present traveled from the
Franciscan University of Steubenville, over
an hour away.

“I’m not enemies with anybody here. I
want to talk to [the escorts] and see what
they have to say,” said Andrew Surine, a stu-
dent at the Catholic university. “I’d like to sit
down with these girls and have a cup of cof-
fee and a conversation.”

The pro-choice escorts steadfastly
refused.

“We’re not here to debate, we’re here to
do a jo ,” said Kim  co—president
of CW O.

According to Harris, “Escorts should
always feel free to engage in any ﬁrst
amendment discourse that they wish, but not
while tl1ey’re wearing the yellow shirts.”
The CW O members try to volunteer every
Saturday but say that sometimes it is diffi-
cult.

“My ﬁrst time here a man came up to
me and threw a whole bottle of holy water
on me,” said  “I was standing there
soaking wet and freezing, and I asked anoth-
er escort, ‘How do you do this?”’

A Pro-Choice Escorts, which has been
operating in Pittsburgh for the past eight
years, is not aﬂiliated with the Women's
Health Services Clinic or any other organi-
zation advocating reprtoductive choice. The
group runs solely on contributions and the
work of volunteers.

“We don’t feel that we should be need-
ed,” said Fisher. “However, until a woman
can walk to the doortof her health services
without being harassed and called names,
we will be here every Saturday.”

CMU students

The January 27 issue of
The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon’s
student newspaper, ran an edi-
torial entitled “Hunt Library
provides inadequate
resources.” This editorial said,
“Although we generally con-
sider Pitt to be academically
substandard in comparison to
CMU, Pitt administrators
seem to have more concern for
providing their students with
adequate research facilities
than do our own.”

Substandard education?
Who at The Tartan is qualified
to make such an observation?

 

  CMU,

shall we? First and
foremost, the fact that Pitt stu-
dents spend enough time in
fresh air and sunlight says
something about our quality of
life. The quality of one’s edu-
cation is not measured by
whether or not one has spent
so much time in a dark, dingy
classroom, library, or comput-
er lab that one now resembles
one of those albino fish with
the skin grown over their eyes
which can be found when one
travels deep into a cave. '

  

     

nel and poor eyesight do not

make one a genius. A pasty,‘

sallow complexion acquired
from spending too_ much time
in ﬂuorescent light is not an
indication of intellect.

The greatest proof of the
superiority of Pitt students to
those at CMU is the fact that
we don’t have to spend
$25,000 a year to get an edu-
cation. We believe that the
quality of an education comes
as much from the effort the

The Tartan ’s editorial goes
on to state that Pitt’s research
facilities are superior to
CMU’s and that CMU students
must do their research here.
Therefore, for about $15,000 a
year less (for Pa. residents),
we are availing ourselves of

even better resources than;

those at CMU. Who is getting

Having been in college for
nearly four whole years, I have (of
course) learned all there is to know
about making money. And money,
as we all know, is useless without
the ability to buy something. The
following column will be dedicated
to purchasing the penultimate sym-
bol of our materialism: the automo-
bile. I will offer my humble wis-
dom here, with the heartfelt hope
thatIcantouchthelifeofoneper—
son striving to make his own life
easier.

One must consider the type of
automobile to purchase. The more
practical-minded approach would
betobyaneconomycarwithgreat
gas mileage (like a Geo). Sure, it
might help save the environment,
but we’re concerned with the ease
and prestige of our own lives here,
not that of our children. Sure it’s
cheaper, but with this few-step pro-
gramyoucanbeonyourwaytothe
symbol of stature that will help you
win friends and inﬂuence people,
which, aside from wealth, is the
ultimate goal. Utility might be a
consideration, but it is enormously
overrated. A sports car is the best
choice.

With this several-step process,
(free with The Pitt News) your
money wonies will be over.

1.) Medical tests, the greatest col-
lege earning potential. One can
“eam” a couple hundred dollars just
by getting deathly ill and taking
experimental drugs for a few days.
Vﬁth the weather around here and
the wonderful options for nourish-
ment, you’re bound to get sick any-
way. Sub-options: Start smoking.
You can then enter a quit smoking
program and get paid for it. Sure it

destroys your lungs,.but hey, they
are offering CASH! Better yet, start
drinking. For years, we’ve been
paying top dollar to drink in
Oakland bars,-and now there’s an
opportunity to get drunk and get
paid for it! Or become obese and
get paid to lose weight. Cash for
every Vice! (I won’t mention the
others, but use your imagination.)
America: the land of opportunity!
2.) Beg. Ah, the time honored tradi-
tion of begging on the Oakland
streets; it brings a tear of nostalgia
to my eye. I hear some beggars
make $9.00/hr., courtesy of gullible
college students. You can play a
musical instrument, so scruples
about getting money for nothing
will be silenced. But it works much
better if, after getting sick and los-
ing your voice from one of those
medical tests (which makes you
sound like a demon with a carton—a—
day habit), you scream at the top of
what formerly were your lungs,
“Can yooou help meee oouut
pleeeeezzze?!?” all the while ver-
bally accosting the pedestrians who
will then pay you to shut up, or
from fear of etemal damnation.
3.)Sell a piece of Bigelow. The
University is bound to attain it
sooner or later, since they own 90
percent of Oakland anyway. (First
Oakland, tomorrow the world!)
This way you too can proﬁt from
Pitt’s local monopoly. You could be
a vendor in the WPU, (another
undeniable symbol of prestige),
with the slogan, “Get your piece
while the gettin’s good!”

4.)Start a religion. Hell, It worked
for Jim Baker. One can choose any
god, but why be hypocritical?
Make Money the god. It’s already
practically there anyway, and it ﬁts
perfectly into our capitalist political
system (i.e., the poor are evil, since

they have less god; the Rich are

good, they have more god). It
would solve the problem of Church
and State and your own poverty in
one fell swoop. Run an ad in The
Pitt News saying “God wants His
body parts back, please send cash
only.” -

5.) Sperm donation. Need I say
more? (Sony ladies.)

6.) Bet freshmen $5 that you can
ask a question telefact can’t answer.
The creative questions are the most

fun. (They still haven’t answered '

the severed heads question.)
However, if really stuck for a
strunper, it’s helpful to know that
they don’t answer any of the really
important questions; homework,
law, and medical questions are
taboo.

7 .)Become a political candidate and
get government funding (or start a
grass roots organization, Ross Perot
style). Then drop out of the race.
8.)Become a college athlete. I hear
sometimes they get cars for free.
9.)Sell your books. The real educa-
tion, as we all know, is outside of
class. Duh!

10.) Go on a talk show. Sometimes
they pay $500 for really pathetic
stories (i.e., a college student who
actually followed the advice of this
article). .

Finally, some things not to do
include: a.) scalping Pitt football
tickets (not a very lucrative enter-
prise); b.) open a restaurant on the
comer of Oakland and Forbes (no
restaurant opened there in the histo-
ry of Oakland has ever succeeded);
c.) get a real job and earn money
(too much like work, and besides,
who would want to go and do a
silly thing like that?).

Jay DeMartin0 was going to write
a disclaimer; but thought better of
it.

What would you do for a million bucks?

 

One chance for a million bucks.

There’s not much I wouldn’t do for a
million bucks. Then again, there’s not much I
wo11ldn’t do for a hundred bucks, but that’s a

whole separate story.

Sunday night at the Pro Bowl in Hawaii,
one lucky guy got the chance of a lifetime.

26-year-old Lance Alstodt, all decked
out in his Hershey #1 jersey and his Adidas
sambas, won a nationwide contest that put
him in Aloha Stadium in ﬁont of millions of
people, with one shot at a 35-yard ﬁeld goal
for a million dollars.

First off, the Pro Bowl is an absolutely
asinine game to play at the end of the season.

other pathetic reasons to snub their invites.
But, for the AFC, it is a chance to redeem
themselves year in and year out, only one
week removed from being drubbed in the
Super Bowl.

The crew of Monday Night Football
moonlighted for the occasion, and once the
second quarter began and the score was 9-0
in favor of the NFC, the sickening rhetoric

Some of the marquee players site injuries or

got under way.

records but full at home
Kent State edges Pitt gymnasts 191.975 to 191.4

Steve Stonaha

 

The Pitt women’s
gymnastics team heads
into every meet expect-
ing to break a school
record. Last Friday’s
meet versus the Kent
State University Golden
Flashes was no disap-

pointment.
In front of 1,072
pumped—up fans at

Fitzgerald Fieldhouse,
Pitt went out and broke a
school record on the
vault with a 48.35.
Tracey Brown led the
way with a 9.775 and
none of the other Pitt
gymnasts scored lower
than a9.5.

Robyn Senior was
the only Pitt gymnast
who performed in the
all-around competition.
Despite falling from the

balance beam, she still
finished in third place
with a 37.75.

Pitt came away a lit-
tle short at the end of the
night, even though they
scored a 48.7 on the
ﬂoor exercise to make
the final score close.
Kent State had 191.975
to Pitt’s 191.4. This was
the highest score ‘for
Pitt’s team this season.
Pitt has improved every
meet this season, which

has made Head Coach.

Debbie Yohman very
happy-

“We had some real
nice things. We correct-
ed some mistakes,” said

Yohman. “But we still
have a little work to go.”
Yohman hopes to

improve on those things

before their next meet.
Danielle “Freddie”

Alba was scheduled to

perform in the all—around
competition, but after a
strong showing in the
vault and the uneven
bars, Yohman decided to
sit her down for the last
two events. Alba has
been bothered all week
by a bad Achilles ten-
don. Yohman thought it
would be better to rest it
than hurt it further and
end her year.

Alba scored a 9.625
on the uneven bars, good
enough to put her in sec-
ond place for the appara-
tus.

Pitt did well enough
to sweep the top three
spots on the floor exer-

, cise. Samantha Salyers

finished in third place
with a 9.725. Erika
Flamer finished in sec-
ond place with a 9.75.
Senior finished a strong
first with a 9.825.

Multitudes of fans are missing out on one of Pitt’s real winners

Brion Knovish

 

I went to Happy Valley this past Friday
nighttowatchPitttakeonPermStateinabat-
tle of nationally ranked wrestling power
houses and came away with two major
impressions. The ﬁrst was a self-conﬁrma-
tion of my long-held notion that Penn State
sucks. My second observation can best be
expressed in a question directed to all Pitt stu-
dents: WHERE IS YOUR SCHOOL SPIR-
IT?

Some 2,525 energetic fans jammed into
PSU’s Rec Hall to support their wrestling
team. This was their smallest crowd of the
year, but still more than twice the size of Pitt’s
largest wrestling crowd These were 2,525

people who chose to go to the match on a
night in which there was also a home
women’s basketball game, a home men’s
volleyball game, the opening of Star Wars,
and poor weather conditions at State College.

In a match against Iowa at Penn State
earlier this year, 11,245 people attended. That
is about ﬁve times as many people as attend-
ed all four of Pitt’s home matches combined.

One might argue that the reason for the
dismal tumstile numbers can be attributed to
poorresults onthematWhilePenn Stateis
the fourth ranked team in the nation, Pitt is
also nationally ranked (24th). In fact, the
wresﬂing team is Pitt’s only ranked team

’ Furthermore, the wrestling team has ﬁnished

inthe top 30inthe countryin 10 ofthe past
11 seasons. The team boasts a couple All-

   

 

  

Americans, not to mention the 10th best
recnriting class inthe country.

But still, Penn State’s average home
attendance this season is 5,630 people per
match, which is more than nine times Pitt’s
average.

One might argue that Penn State’s
greater size is the reason. While Penn State
does have a larger student body (about

38,000 compared to Pitt’s 26,083), little

schools with division-one teams such as
Edinborohaveusbeat Pittismorethanthree
times larger than Edinbom (7,400), but their
average attendance this season is twice as
large as Pitt’s. Pennsylvania is the best
wrestling state in the nation. More great grap-
plers hail from this commonwealth than any

Dan Marino (yes, that Dan Marino)
was spotted eating lunch with his wife,
Claire, and two of his children yesterday at
The ‘O’ (yes, that ‘O’).

Between 11:00 and 11:30 a.m., no
more than 20 people approached the NFL’s
all-time leader in touchdowns, yards, and
completions. Most people just asked for his
autograph or to shake his hand.

Not everyone who met the 1983 Pitt
graduate could contain themselves, though.

“A guy came riuming into the Tower C
lobby, looking like he pissed himself, and
let everyone know he had just met Dan

e heart (burn) is

Marino at The ‘O,”’ said sophomore

" Valerian Dec. “I ﬁgured I’d go see for

myself and my jaw hit the ﬂoor when I
actually saw him in there.”

Marino’s only comments were, “I can’t
talk right now. I’m with my family.”

He was also observed walking with his
family up Cardiac I-Iill towards Pitt
Stadium earlier in the day.

Dan Marino was born in Pittsburgh
and attended Pitt from 1979 to 1982,
throwing for over 8,000 yards. In 1983, he

was drafted in the first round, 27th pick

overall, by the Miami Dolphins, for whom
he still plays. He now resides in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., with his wife and four
children.

Al Michaels, Dan Dierdorf, and Frank
Gifford are broadcasting’s version of the
Three Amigos. For the entire second quarter
they bypassed the game and did everything
but give Alstodt an enema on the sidelines
before the poor guy’s biggest moment ever.

They panned over to his ﬁancee and
questioned whether or not she knew where
the money was going, if Lance had signed a
prenuptial agreement, or if he was even
going to keep her around if he split the
uprights.

As the clock ticked down towards the
end of the ﬁrst half, Lance’s smiles slowly
turned to looks of anticipation, and sweat
foirned on his brow. This cheeseball, who
had been saying, “show me the money’
before the game, was now thinking, “show
me the bathioorn because I’m about to crap
my pants.” .
