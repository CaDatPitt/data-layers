The practice 0 of etudents selling

their tickets for football games must
cease, members of the Omicron, Delta
Kappa, Honorary National Fraternity,.
decided at a meeting last Wednesday.
It was unanimously decided to co-
operate with the Student Senate and
the University athletic authorities in
“preventing this practice. . .

Every possiblegmeans-will be used
to prevent students from selling their
books, members of the fraternity -said‘.
According to members, this practice
has lessened the morale and spirit of
.University ‘ students, and -has lessened
the inﬂuence of the University in the
estimation of many persons- The fra-
ternity will continue its vigil until this
practice has been exterminated, it was
said. O '

A committee was appointed at the
meeting to nominate candidates for
president, Howard C. Kidd, who was
former president, having left for the
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
where he is professor of Economics.
Reports from stading committees were
also read. Continuation of -co-opera-
tion with the Student Senate in re-
gard to student activities was en-

- couraged in one of the reports.

The fraternity will hold its next
meeting October 23. Later in the fall
a public. meeting of importance to the

.Miss Beatrice Young, one of the new

teaching of a rather unusual nature.
It was that ‘of -graduating from the
University of Brussels in September,
1914, with the city -full of German -sol.
diers and the ﬁnal examinations tak-
ing place while the school windows
rattled -from the heavy cannonading.

Miss Young received the diploma.
from the Belgian university two
months after the German-invasion be
gan, and left the country soon there
after. During» the following winter
she was secretary to the Belgian con-
sul in New York. . - -

Miss Young was laterappointed an

er gridders last year, opened the sea-

The eleven men who started against
Geneva Saturday will hardly compose

_Un;les~s the Freshmen are able to

realizes the importance of beingable
to swim "in a capable manner and, in
view of this necessity, all men who
do not swim are- required" to. learn the
sport before he is graduated.

. L‘ Athleytes Exempt.

L Men who compete souccessfully in
such branches of sport as football,-
-basketball, track and tennis are ex-
empt, from physical ed-ucatvion. -One
seaspn on either squad corresponds to
two credits in gymnasium exercises,
and two seasons will work on "-the
physical ‘education credits. This ap-
plies to Freshmen athletics as well as
men on the varsity -squads. _

All the ﬁrst year men who havethe
necessary physical requisites or who
have had previous. experience are
urged tot report for Freshmen, ath-
letics- A football squad is never so I
,-large that it cannot make room for
more good material. The same may
be said of «the other sports. If you are
a basketball player dognot fail to re-
port when the call is given for the
first year men to makeup a floor team.

‘‘ Track Men.Noeded'. . ;

Whatever applies to football or bas-
ketball is more than true of track.
Good track men are needed,,and need-
ed very badly, at Pitt -thisyear. A
Freshman squad will be carried and,
it is hoped, that a promising lot of‘
material will report; An ihdoor cinder

and, it is hoped-, that traickmen will
make good use of it during thewinter,

T-h-ree assistant managers have charge
of the Cub squad during the season, or
at least till one shows that he is the
most capable of the trio to manage
the squad. They are..Toomey, Eek-

Edgar and Clawson are all products of
Kiski, though Edgar started at Wil-
kinsburg, and was a; member of the
.Was'hlngton and Jefferson varsity last

sﬁason. Holleran is a. resident of the‘

Oakland district, and ﬁrst started to
play football on the lots in this sec-
tion. Tom was a.- star in three
branches. of sport at Kiski—-football,
baseball and ,ba:sketba.ll.- He is a
dandy basketball‘ prospect,‘ being con-
sidered one of the best scholastic
ﬂoor men. in this section... Holleran
will more than likely run the team
from the quarterback ‘position, as he
seems to be the most likely candidate
for the signal calling job, Williams
is big,’ husky lad and .weighs .185.
He plays 3. tackle and is}. one. of -the

best’ ever turnediiout by Doc Marks.

He ‘attended Parnassus High for a
year before entering Kiski, and was

..on,the eleven there. He has a record

of notmissing a single-contest in his
ﬁve years of scholastic football. Edgar
is also a.’ tackle and, like Williams, is
one of the best. He is also a star on
the ﬂoor,_playing a guard. Somepair!
Clawson comes from Irwin, thehome
town of Frank Shea. And; by the bye,

and can play practically any position
on the team. -He looks particiilaiiy

looks very good. Scott was the All-

weighs 195 pounds. I ‘

‘;,This summer Harry Gowiwas-*ap_-
pointedmanager of the track team
and J. E. Wiegel was elected captain.
Harry is 'a; senior. in the School of
Economics. — He is the second member
of the Gow family to become a ‘Pitt
manager. His brother, Steele, at

present wi;t.h»'the publicity department

at Pitt, guided the destinies of the '16
baseball team, and was one of the
most successful managers the Panth-
ers ever had. .Harry bids fair to
eclipse his. brothers record. He
proved that he was qualiﬁed when, as
assistant, he took the team to State.
Besides this Gow is quite active po-
litically, » as he is president of the
Student Senate, one of the highest
honorsﬁthat can come to an under-
graduate. His entire. school career
has been marked by’ political activity.
In his spare time. he writes for The
Weekly, of which he is sporting editor.
With all these activities he manages
to keep up in his classes, and should
graduate» with honors. He_ lives. on.
the North ‘Side, and is a member‘ of
the S. A. E; Fraternity. '
The election ‘of Red Wiegel was
quite popular, as he is the hardest
working andmost earnest man on the
track squad. At present he holds the
Univ. rsity record for two" miles, is the

ﬁnished -second in the national junior
'5-mile championships. “Red” lives up
the Monon Valley at Lock Np. 4.. He
—is a member of Lambda Chi Alpha
fraternity and a. senior in the college.

football teams‘ have hasi quite an
.edge on their old  & J. rivals, and
in ‘only one year of the last ﬁve have
the Washington lads [come close to
winning. That. was in 1911, when
Scrublry,McCreight.'s eleven held the
Panthers to a 13-10’ score. .. .
However, this year all the dope in-
dicates ,thaL.t the W. & J. game this;
year is to return to its original status;
as one of the toughest encounters Pitt
has. to face. The Presidents present
one of «the. best linie-ups they have
shown in years. CaptainiCarro1l, at
left end, is the nucleus around which
a really great team is being built. Be-
side the sturdy Scottdaleb lad, "there-
are in the line Stein, Shields, Straw,
iGa.rbisch and Wickerham, all members
of Red - and Black teams before the
-war“. -There is hardly a heaviLer“lin_e~
in the country. and," if its efficiency
can be rated on the basis of the “past
performances. of the-ygmen who com-
poseit, those seven men-are going to
give the Panther ﬁrst defense a great
tussle. J A . ‘
I The W. & J. adherents declare‘ that
the backﬁeld is the ﬁrst really good.
quartet the institution has had to
boast of in years. Every man behind
-the line is a star. Smith is a Red and
Black veteran of two years’ service,

but -Brenlrert, Eielson and Erickson

are newcomers. The latter two played
with the Great Lakes Naval Training
Station, team last fall. .

It seems like old_ times to look for-
ward with anxiety to the Pitt-W. &' J.
game._ When the old rivals lock horns,

-November 8, a real ﬁght should be

staged.
