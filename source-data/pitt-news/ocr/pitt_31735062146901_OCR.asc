Captain John A. Finnerty, Pitt

military executive officer, left
yesterday for new duties with the
Third Service command.

Capt. F innerty
Leaves Pitt

Because of the general reduction
in Army Specialized Training
units, Captain John A. Finnerty,
executive officer of Pitt’s military
department has been transferred to
the Third Service command head-
quarters in Baltimore. He left
yesterday.

A 1932 graduate of Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, Cap-
tain Finnerty held a reserve com-
mission until April of 1942 when
he came to Pitt as a Reserve Offi-
cers Training Corps instructor.
While here he worked out many
of the formations used by the
band.

Under the Army Specialized
Training program he” was ‘com-
pany commander of the medical
unit, Company C. Later he be-
came an.executive ofﬁcer. ‘

Finnerty came to Pitt as a sec-
ond lieutenant, received his first
lieutenant’s commission in July of
1942, and became a captain in
August 1943.

Before coming to Pitt Captain
Finnerty was a heating, ventilat-
ing, and air conditioning engineer
in New York City.

Arthur Sets Rehearsal

.Mr. Robert Arthur, director of
the University orchestra, an-
nounces that there will be a re-
hearsal of the orchestra’ at
Stephen Foster memorial on
Thursday night, January 4, be-
tween 7 and 9 o’clock.,

All candidates for the orches-
tra should be present with their
own instruments or make ar-
rangements with Mr. Arthur in
the dean of men’s ofﬁce previous

to the rehearsals.

Schenley Mansion Ballroom

To Grace Cathedral 1st Floor

Another room of distinctive
architecture will be added to the

area that surrounds the Commons
room in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing.

The new addition is the ornate,
classically styled ballroom of the
Schenley mansion, soon to be dis-
mantled. The ballroom, as ex-
pressed by Charles M. Stolz,
authority on architecture, is one
of" the most distinguished exam-
ples of the Greek Revival Style
to ‘be found in the United States.

After a period of necessary re-
pair and reconstruction, the ball-
room, including the stately col-
’ umns, huge crystal and bronze

chandelier, and mirrored walls,

Schenley, has not been occupied
for 82 years. The property was
purchased recently from the
Schenley estate, and at the re-
quest of Chancellor John G. Bow-
man, a proviso was made by the
trustees that the ballroom would
be presented to Pitt.

Many drawings and measure-
ment tests must be made of the
ballroom and the area reserved
at Pitt ‘before the actual moving
can take place. “W-e are greatly
handicapped in our work by the
lack of lighting and heating facili-
ties at the mansion, but the work
is well under way,” said Albert
A. Klimcheck, University archi-
tectural draftsman.

The ﬁrst preliminary step to
test whether the conditions of the
Cathedral are suited for the ball-
room has been made successfully.

Deans Approve
Activities Hour
For September

In response to Student congress’
petition for the establishment of a
student activities hour, the board
of deans of the University has
voted to set aside an hour each
week for activities meetings, be-
ginning next September, Theodore
W. Biddle, dean ofmen, has an-
nounced.

The Committee, appointed by Dr.
Rufus H. Fitzgerald, vice-chan-
cellor, to consider Student con-
gress’ -proposal, has recommended
that the fourth hour, Tuesday and
Thursday, be. completely free of
classes and be used in this man-
ner: Tuesday-—Combined Drill
(all [ROTC students); Thursday
—general student activities. The
committee, chairmaned by Dean
Biddle,’ also proposed that the
fourth hour, Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, be reserved for fresh-
men and sophomores as follows:
two periods weekly for basic
ROTC and one period weekly for
men’s and women’s orientation and
engineering seminar. The only
othercourses that might be sched-
uled for this hour would be those
deﬁnitely for juniors and seniors.

The deans’ committee rejected
alternative proposals put forth by
Student congress, such as the sixth
hour, Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday for activities; or 90-min-
ute lunch hours, because of con-
ﬂict between these recommenda-
tions and the general class sched-
ule.

The committee which passed on
the Congress’ recommendations
consisted of Dean Biddle, Dean of
Women Helen P. Rush, Deans S.
C. Crawford, E. A. _Holbrook, and
V. W. Lanfear, Major M. V. Wills,
and Mr. R. J. Munce.

This cafeteria, which serves
warm food and offers a time-

will remain in charge of Miss-

the Tuck shops. Miss Cramblet
asks that those who still wish to
purchase only sandwiches, bev-
erages, and desserts continue to
eat in the Tuck shops.

Several regulations have been
s-et up in regard to the revised
usage of the cafeteria. All mili-
tary .personnel will enter and
leave ‘by the Bigelow boulevard
side while all civilians will use
the corridor leading from the
Fifth avenue entrance. A

Because the majority of serv-
icemen have left the University,
the cafeteria has been turned over

are still quartered here. The cafe-
teria will not only be something

different for the students, but will.

I Praternity Hazing Banned

By National I-F Conference

New York, N. Y.——(ACP)-—All

‘ forms of hazing involving mental

or physical torture, including pad-
dling, will be banned officially and
absolutely by all colleges and uni-
versities throughout the country
an-d offenders, both individuals
and organizations, disciplined if
the request of the National Inter-

ence, held in New York City, No-
vember 24-2'5.

While such forms of hazing
were condemned in earlier ses-
sions, this is the first deﬁnite re-
quest_ made for action by the
Administrative -officers of educa-
tional institutions. For years the
National Interfraternity confer-

» ized on Auld Lang Syne.

 

  

ence and its 60 member fraterni-
ties have tried through educa-
tional means to eliminate ques-
tionable hazing practices among
the 2,422 undergraduate chapters
of the 2400 fraternity campuses in
this country. In placing the re-
sponsibility for prohibition and
enforcement on the l-ocal adminis-
tration, fraternity leaders hope
that the problem will be solved.

fraternity conference is not fol-
lowed.

A A resolution declaring such
forms of hazing a menace to the
welfare of ‘educational institutions
and the various organizations
which are part of the institutions,
as well as to individual students,
was passed unanimously at the
thirty-sixth annual meeting of the
National Interfraternity confer-

!7a cl/age M /Vol‘ ‘7a 

Fraternity hell-week’s departure from campus life, as
recommended by the National Interfraternity conference a few
weeks ago, shakes the dust from the sage question: “What good
is hazing?” P

Without doubt, the question will be discussed pro and con
throughout the country as well as at Pitt by boards of deans.
That a decision, regardless of its favor, must be reached, and
that this decision will rock the pillars of future fraternity life,
are beyond question. Either strict prohibition of hazing or a
decided curbing of hell-week activities will result.

According to the National IF conferees, “All forms of haz-
ing involving physical or mental torturie” will be banned.

With the latter point of their prohibition We can readily
agree. Excessive paddling, ice-water duckings, and cold weather
hellrides should be tabooed. As a test for physical endurance
they are ridiculous. Returning veterans with only basic train-
ing to show as their military experience must subdue a hearty
belly-laugh at the hell-week “ordea1.” It becomes more of a.
farce, when men who know that they can ’t take overexertion are
exempted from all abuse.

Abolishing mental hazing, the ﬁrst point in the conferees
objections, we think, is a step in the wrong direction. Mental
hazing, too, has a number of faults, but its shortcomings are
overcome by one big factor in its favor—it teaches the man to

‘swallow his pride. The greatest obstacle :to the success of any
organization is exaggerated individual pride. Without. revealing -

any fraternal secrets, the chief aim of hell-week is to require a
m-an to do something he is set against doing. And this is an idea
developed by philosophers dating back to the-time of Omar
Khayyam. Bill Veenis.

General Kirk
Praises Pitt
Hospital 27

The University of Pittsburgh
has “particular reason to be
proud” of the work of its General
Hospital 27 serving in the South‘
Paciﬁc, according to a letter
Major General Norman T. Kirk,
Surgeon General of the United
States Army, wrote to Chancellor
John G. Bowman.

General Kirk has just returned
from a second overseas inspection
during which he reviewed all
phases of medical service from
first aid at the front to loading of
hospital ships and airplanes
evacuating the most seriously
wounded. He wrote:

“T-he entire country has good
reason to be proud of the ﬁne
Work which our doctors, nurses,
and corps men are performing.
Time and again, the wounded
called this to my attention, and I
had many opportunities to judge
of their splendid contributions
myself.”

As for Pitt, he stated:

“You have particular reason to
be proud of this work because
your University -contributed so
much to the high standards of
medical care which the Army is
now, in this hour of need, able
-to make available to its ﬁghting
men.”

General Hospital 27 was reor-
ganized early in 1941. As'Base
Hospital 27 it had served in
France 15 months during World
War 1. Mobilization was com-
pleted on July 15, 1942, when the
unit left for Fort Lewis, Wash-
ington. -It went overseas in 1943.
Itis commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Harry E. Feather and is
composed of Pitt medical and
dental faculty members and
nurses.

Seventy-nine degrees have been.
granted to women since the open-
ing of the school ﬁve years ago,
and Dean Ruth Perkins Kuehn is
very proud of ‘the efforts of these-
nurses.

The School of Nursing has its.
own service honor roll for nurses
overseas. On May 3 the ﬁrst gold
star was added when Elsie Keasey
was killed in a jeep in England‘
while serving in the 810th Medi-
cal Air Evacuation Squadron.

The Air Evacuation Service is.
a very difficult branch of the
service, requiring high stability
and high intelligence of its women.
Only women attached ‘to this unit.
can wear gold wings. =Lt. Mary
Cook, who graduated with the
highest standing in her class for‘
bedside nursing, is also a gradu-
ate of the Air Evacuation Service.

A Wednesday. January 3, 1945

C
By Ed Citron
Hurrah! Hail to the new, let’s Here’s an answer at last as to

be gone with the old.

I really disliked it. . . Decem-
her was cold.

I know there were times that I
couldn’t call bad,

But to reminisce makes me feel
.. .Oh. . .sosad.

And when I feel thusly there’s
the Boots ’n Saddle,

I race for a bar stool which I
quickly straddle. '

I’m able,

You’ll generally ﬁnd me at the
closest table;

Not seated around it as sober
folks are,

But curled up- beneath it——ten
feet from the bar.'!

So in order to start out this New
Year with zest,

I’ll state my resolutions and then
take a rest.

First on my formidable list there’s
. , prediction.

Don’t jump on me fellows, last
year’s stuff was fiction.’

From now on I promise to stay
out of ruts,

Just let me drop down for those
Lucky Strike butts!

Secondly, the issue of inebriation.

But that’s a result of continued
frustration.

And so to be truthful with all

involved,

how I’ve it solved:

Now when I am tempted and to
the bar beckoned,

I’ll refuse it each month on the
thirty-second!

Thirdly, there arises the problem
of females.

Oh, what magniﬁcent creatures
for we males.

They are oft referred to as the
scourge of mankind!

‘But I pray to be plagued with

them . . the luscious kind.

Here I solemnly pledge I’ll not
worry ’bout them.

You can’t figure them out .
a fem is a few!

Lastly are some items of most

worthy note.

The Dream Team and June Thom-

Leads Geneva Five

is. This boy’s really good. You

better stop him if you want to
WIN ’EM ALL

, ‘Both Teams Have

Perfect Records

This evening, §oc Carlson’s
1945 edition of the Pitt basket-
ball squad, the “Fearless Phan-
toms,” will open their home sea-
son by playing host to Geneva’s
undefeated Covenanters on the
Pavillion ﬂoor at eight o’clo-ck.
The Phantoms won their inaugu-
ral tilt over second rate Alle-
gheny at Meadville on December
15, by a comfortable margin,
63-31, and have remained idle
since then. Geneva, on the other
hand, boasts a team of veterans
that has c-opped four straight de-
cisions. Dr. Harold Bruce’s start-
ing quintet, which has been
smothering all opposition this
season, includes Bill DeVenzio,
last year’s captain and playmaker,
and Elmer Lipp, a product of
North Catholic High, who, as a
freshman starter, was the Cove-
nanter’s leading point-maker last
season.

However, despite it all, the Pan-
thers probably will be pre—game
favorites among the betting fra-
ternity which is spotting Geneva
around four points. One reason is
that the Genevans are up against

A
an oldtime jinx; namely, that of

walking away from the stadium
with a win. In recent years, no
matter how good their squad has
been, the boys from Beaver Falls
have consistently come out second
best in this traditional tussle. Sec-
ondly Dr. H. C. Carlson has mould-
ed a pretty formidable combination
of veterans and youngsters. The
starters include: Nate Apple, last
year’s lone returning letterman;
Tay Malarkey, a veteran of two
year’s ago and this season’s cap-
tain; I-lank Zeller, a member of
the Wash-Jeff 1943 Metropolitan
Tourney champions; Phil Marder,
who played as a freshman for
Indiana U, and starred in the
Muny league last year; Frank
Morris, freshman from Ava1on’s
championship ﬁve; and Dodo Can-

terna, high—scoring freshman from ,

Freeport.

This Geneva-Pitt struggle will
go a long way in deciding the dis-
trict championship.

9 Determination and the “try, try
again” spirit characterize Mrs.
Ruth Crawford Mitchell, former
advisor of the nationality rooms
who is now overseas with the
Balkan Mission division of the
United Nations Relief and Reha-
bilitation administration. Mrs.
Mitchell is remembered here at
Pitt for the thoroughness of her
work in connection with the na-
tionality rooms. She directed the
committees, helped with the plans,
and even_ made ‘trips abroad to
confer with committees in vari-
ous foreign countries about their
respective rooms.

After war was declared, Mrs.
Mitchell became assistant director
of the Army Specialized Training
program and the Civil Affairs
Training school here. During this
time -she made contacts which
enabled the ofﬁcers to visit homes
and talk with families of the par-
ticular nationality they were
studying.

In September 1943, Mrs. Mitch-
ell obtained a leave of absence
from the University, and went to
the University of Maryland, where
she took a special -six week.s
course in preparation for her
duties with UNRRA. She was sur-
prised to ﬁnd there one of her
former ofﬁcer-students teaching
the course.

-Upon completion of her studies,
Mrs. Mitchell left New York City
on a one-time luxury liner for
overseas. Her ship docked in Scot-
land and from there she took a
troop train to London. After a
few days sojourn in London, she
left for Cairo, Egypt, ‘her ﬁnal
destination.

Before being associated with
the nationality rooms, Mrs. Mitch-
elil was a member of the sociology
department. She is looking for-
ward to the\war’s end and» the
tiine when she will once again be-
furthering foreign relations in

America instead of furthering
American interests in foreign
countries. R
