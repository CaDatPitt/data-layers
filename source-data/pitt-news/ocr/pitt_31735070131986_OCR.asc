THE P1TT_NEws

Pitt alum predicts more
corporate scandals to come

FLANNERY AMDAHL
Staff Writer

Attorney William Lerach warned
audiences about huge, impending cor-
porate scandals the last time he was in
Pittsburgh. That was three years ago ——
before the Enron ﬁasco.

When he spoke Downtown again
last week, the Pitt law school graduate
predicted corporate America will soon
“erupt into an even greater corporate
scandal than we have today.”

Lerach has devoted his career to
helping prevent such scandal. Lerach’s
brother introduced him as “the nation’s
leading security class action lawyer,”
and said Lerach has collected over $30
billion in recoveries.

Lerach, also the keynote speaker at
Pitt law school’s graduation ceremony
on Saturday, addressed a group com-
prised mainly of Pittsburgh lawyers on
Friday. The audience enthusiastically
applauded Lerach’s former corporate
law professor at Pitt, after Lerach point-
ed him out in the audience.

Lerach is currently working in
California on cases against Enron and
AOL Time Warner.

According to Lerach, prosecuting
corporate crime and using litigation to
recover losses are the most important
ways to prevent further corporate cor-
ruption and restore investors’ trust.

“I think what will change things is
a couple of these guys going to jail for
10 to 15 years. Maybe that will create
some fear,” Lerach said.

He added that many stockholders
are forming class actions suits against
corporations they believe exploited
them.

Lerach does not hope for much use-
ful legislative reform any time soon
because “corporate interests are too
strong.” He dismissed the recent leg-
islative efforts to curb corruption as
being too weak. .

In fact, Lerach believes the legisla-
tive efforts of the 1990s largely enabled
the corporate scandals. Lerach attrib-

' - At 4:27 a.m., Officers assisted city

uted the Republican-supported 1995
Securities Act to a “tsunami of corpo-
rate lobbying.” .

According to Lerach, the goal of
the 1995 Securities Act was to reverse
many of the corporate restrictions
passed after the stock market crash of
1929 that spawned the Great
Depression.

After the crash, Congress exposed
many false accounting practices and
passed the Securities Act of 1933,
intended to prevent further corruption.
It required truthful reporting and pro-
hibited insider trading.

Lerach said that, because the
reforms following the 1929 crash
restored‘ trust, the “investing money
came back out from under the mat-
tress.”

Many of the laws passed under the
1995 Securities Act, however, relaxed
corporate liability toward investors. For
example, corporations were no longer
responsible for ‘false projections that
might unjustifiably encourage
investors.

Lerach testiﬁed before Congress in
1995, giving warning about the bill. It
was, nevertheless, passed after former
President Bill Clinton’s veto was over-
ridden by a margin of one vote.

The 1995 Act led directly to the
recent scandals, according to Lerach.
He cited, as an example, the inside trad-

’ ing that led Enron insiders to sell $1.2"

billion of stock shortly before the com-
pany collapsed. '

“Most of the reported earnings of
the last five years were nothing more
than illusions,” he said.

“When crime pays, you get crime,”
he added.

Lerach received a standing ovation
after his lecture, and fellow lawyer
Denis Unkovic described the speech as
“breathtaking? . 3

Unkovic, whose mother lost money
in her pension plan because of corpo-
rate fraud, described Lerach as “one of
the true visionaries  who sees society
for what it ought to be.”

Good weather improves state’s air

Air, page 1

means there is an unacceptable
amount of ozone in the air, accord-
ing to the EPA’s Air Quality Index.
Ozone is a form of oxygen that
reacts in sunlight with hydrocar-
bons and nitrogen oxides —- pollu-
tants released by fuel burning — to
produce smog. The level of smog
rises during the months of May
through October, when higher tem-
peratures and increased amounts of
sunlight speed up the reactions.
According to the ALAPA, about
10.5 million Pennsylvanians face
health risks from hazardous levels
of smog, especially during the sum-
mer. Of the 29 counties ranked in
Pennsylvania, the ones receiving
the iworst grades were Bucks,

. Montgomery and Northampton.

Other counties receiving failing
grades were Beaver, Washington,
Westmoreland, Allegheny, Greene,

V Lancaster, Armstrong, Delaware,

Franklin, Lehigh and Philadelphia.
The only counties in Pennsylvania
to receive passing grades were
Lawrence and Tioga, with Ds, and
Lycoming County, which got a C
for the fourth year in a row.

Despite these poor grades,

Pennsylvania’s overall score for air

quality improved slightly over its
score in last year’s report.

But according to Stewart, this
change resulted from favorable
weather not from an improvement
in smog control.

The ALA made the findings
public shortly after the Bush
administration cut back regulations
in the Clean Air Act, a move that
Stewart warns could have serious
consequences,

“There is a strong potential that
we are going backwards,” he said.
“We shouldn’t be going backwards.
The Clean Air Act is a strong tool
that can help to control air pollu-
tion.” . '

' The ALA encourages people to
fight Washington’s rollbacks by let-

ting members of Congress know ,

that they, as Americans, 'want
cleaner air. Its Web site, www.lun-
gusa.org, has information on" the
report andoffers contact informa-
tion for congressional representa-
tives. Some of the cities that
received the lowest marks are Los
Angeles, Houston, Atlanta,
Charlotte, Baltimore, New York,
Philadelphia, Allentown,
Bethlehem, Easton, Lancaster,
Harrisburg, Reading, Sharon,
Johnstown and Washington, DC.

PSU has a goodidea; let’s show them up

Mark the calendars of history.

_ Penn State had a good idea, followed
through with it and set an example for col-
leges everywhere.

College students have a nasty habit of
throwing away lots of perfectly useful items
at the end of each term, in a rush to put the
rigors of the semester behind them.

Any savvy South Oaklander can attest
to this proclivity —April boasts some of the
ﬁnest Dumpster-diving around, in terms of
furniture, . clothing and bar-ﬁlched‘ beer
signs. ’

While it’s distressing to see this indica-
tion of consumerism run amok, it’s encour-
aging to note Penn State’s unique solution.

They asked students, rather than throw-

‘ ing out the items they can’t cram into what-

ever they are driving home, to donate them

to a school—sponsored rurmnage sale.

" \ The sale took place Saturday at 8:30

a.m. with free admission, or, for $5, early

birds could get ﬁrst crack at the goods at 7.
The folks of Happy Valley raised about

$37,500 for charity and collected about

-$18,000 worth of food through an utterly
logical, well-thought-out program called
Trash to Treasure. ‘ ’

Good for them. Now, how long until
we show those jokers up?

_ Student Government Board ought to be
all over this idea like white on rice and make
it — much like Pitt itself — far superior.

, There’s no question whether we’ve got
the resources. '
Dorms are constantly ﬁlling Dumpsters

with perfectly decent, if outmoded, furni— '

ture

‘Oakland sidewalks, on any trash_day in A

late April or early May, are like giant, out-
door, free stores.
. And what does anyone use the patio of
Posvar Hall for?
Make a University-wide aImounce—
ment. Send a press release to this newspa-

» per.

Pick a weekend after each term ends
and have a giant yard sale.

Get the Greeks in on it. Get any inter-
ested student organization in on it.

Make it a competition. Make it into a

. new tradition, a great feather in SGB’s cap.

Organizations could rent trucks and
charge students —— or whoever else came to
the sale — a nominal fee to haul their recy-

cled treasures to their homes. See who could .

raise the most .

If the sale turned into a success, text-
books co11ld even be introduced at future

‘Everyone-’s sick of the Book Center’s
price gouging on used book buyback rates
and prices. Why not have a few tables set
aside for texts?

Such a sale could only be a win-win sit-
uation. It would keep bulky garbage out of

go to any number of charities. 7

Or the University could certainly use it,
after all the funding cuts it has endured.
Heck, it could even go to buying a mate for
our beloved bronze panther.

Orbs of love weren’t part of the bargain

As much ﬁm as we know male genitalia
can be, it really isn’t all that much to look at.
It can be sort of funny to gaze ‘upon a
pair of wririldy skin—eggs and think how
much control those two little
globs actually exert upon their

If you’re not careful with
these observations, they can
really bruise some egos and
spoil some moments.

Usually, though, it’s notan
issue. If you own a pair of testi-
cles yourself, you’re used to the _
way they look. And if you aren’t
the proud owner of your own
set, you typically only encounter them in sit-
uations where the aesthetics of the equip-
ment are the least of your concerns.
Regardlessof all this, we live in a society
where we only see nuts when we want to.

Not so in the wide world of animals.
Those suckers just run around naked all the
time, indecent exposure laws be damned.
They’re into lettin’ it all hang out.

Especially rodents.

In rodent—land, the fellas just don’t give
a damn. The less-than—appetizing aspects of
their orbs of love take on elephantine pro-
portions. Literally. The testicle—to—cranium
size ratio on most rodents is an even one.

This similarity always seemed to be a
revealing insight into the personalities of
dude rodents, and beasties in general. This is
why every animal ever to live with my fam-

ily has been female.

Eventually, I left home for school and
needed’ a companion of my own. That’s
when the legendary Zelda came into my life.

TinyratZandIhadadamngoodcou-
ple of years. She ate, drank and partied like
royalty, and she was neat, clean and —
thankfully + self—contained. True, the two
of us lived with a human dude, but he usual-
ly kept his stories to himself around the
house.

Usually.

Assistant Opinions Editor

Anyway, Zelda lived out her natural life
span with me, and a few months ago, she
died. It was sad, but‘ she’d probably be
rolling her eyes if she saw me moping and
mooning. So a few weeks
ago, I adopted this tiny little
fuzzbucket of an infant rat —
female, of course.

Of course.

The critter’s name,
Paragraph, just sort of
occurred to me, like most
names I’ve given animals
over the years. But
Paragraph’s no name for a lit-
tle rat princess, so a friend sug-
gested Lola You know, like the Kinks’ song
about the transvestite.

As a corripromise, I called her Miss
Lola Paragraph. Sort of has a drag queen
ring to it, doesn’t it? A _

Furmy I should’ve given her a drag-
queen/transvestite name, because her
cojones seemed to get a littlebigger every
day.

By the time the  was unmistakably
dragging along behind him, though, I’d fall-
en madly in love with Paragraph. It’s been
odd coming to terms with his dude—hood.

He’s the man of the house, which I sup-
pose is kind of cool. I can’t really make hint
take out the trash or get stulf from the top
shelves, but he’s loads of fun.

Conuarypto my long—held assumptions
about anyone with family jewels that size, he
doesn’t stink, nor is he territorial or mean.
And no, he’s never once tried to hump my
le . ‘

g I’m getting to be so used to them, I
almost don’t notice that swingin’ sack of his.

Okay, that’s a lie. They’re ﬁickin’ huge.

But hey, love Paragraph, love his balls,
gargantuan as they may be.

A sentimental gesture bogged downby gender roles

I gave someone ﬂowers recently. These weren’t subtle
ﬂowers —— these were big, pink blooms on two-foot stems
wide as bamboo poles. Before I could give them to him, I
lugged them around Oakland. .

People called out to me, asked to see them, to know
what kind they were and who gave them to me.

I explained I was not the recipient, but the giver, and
these ﬂowers were not going to an aging aunt or graduating

friend, but a boyfriend. This seemed to throw people off, but ‘

they appeared to accept it

I wasn’t offended by any of the comments tossed out
during my trek When a housemate asked why I bought
ﬂowers, I responded, “I like ﬂowers and don’t like gender
roles.”

It surprised me when everyone assumed that I had got-
ten these ﬂowers, though it makes sense. Flowers, even ones
that look like Pepto-Bismol-colored tiki torches, are seen as
a romantic gift Behold the Valentine’s cliche — a man pre-
senting a woman a dozen red roses, thorns removed.

’ Even though my ﬂowers looked like jungle ﬂora, peo-
ple assumed the same circumstances for the transaction
applied: Man gives woman ﬂowers; woman knows botani-
cals mean love, and parades them around.

In essence, a woman with ﬂowers is a wanted woman.
Or as one of the people I passed put it, “You must be some-
body special, if someone gives you ﬂowers like that.”

But, as I said, I don’t like gender roles. I won’t harp on
how this instance could be indicative of larger social ills or

 

that people’s assumptions need to change, because it’s not
and they don’t

Rather than being offensive, these exchanges
evoked nostalgia, .as if these comments had been sent
through a time machine, beamed
from the 1950s to my ears.
Though the ﬁght for equal wages
and recognition is deﬁnitely not
over, I’m not so hardcore that I

sciousness that everyone insists
on raising, ﬂie knowledge that
things aren’t anywhere near per-
fect, but we can pick our battles.

meaningful exchanges. If people A

can’t change the way they view ﬂowers, then perhaps they
can’t change salary discrepancies or glass 

I’m wont to believe the people who stopped me on the
street meant the best. Maybe they were in on the time-travel
transmission, too. Maybe they just saw ﬂowers and gave lit-
tle thought to the girl struggling with them.

Yet, something in me is hesitant to believe the onlook-
ers were in on my enjoyment of glittering nostalgia or that
the ﬂowers were holding themselves aloft Does this situa-
tion call for over-analysis? Would assigning anything deeper.
to these chirped greetings sour their kindness? -

take people to task over ﬂowers. »

A friend of mine said if anyone showed up with ﬂowers

. , _ on a ﬁrst date with her, the relationship would be over before
it began. She said that ﬂowers were for saps, romantics, peo- I

ple who barter emotion — all groups she didn’t want to be
in. ‘
I asked if it could be any ﬂower, or just the traditional

single long-stem rose. She replied unless it was a cactus, it .

counted Cacti were ﬁne.
I’wouldn"t lump myself With any of the groups she

named. Anti-romantic that I am, I do not see ﬂowers sym- - ’
bolizing anything. They’re simply well grown, pretty and the -

product of much labor. _ .

When I worked in a garden, I sported the broken ﬁnger-
nails and faded pants that come from serious gardening.
Plants were work, usually in the morning sun, but deﬁnitely
worth the sweat. ‘

I hadn’t grown the ﬂowers I gifted, but I could appreci-
ate their beauty and complexity.

I could also appreciate the complexity of their connota-
tions. To the people on the street, they meant someone want-

ed me. To my friend, they represent aspects of people she-

didn’t want to deal with. I see them as gifts, something affec-
tionate, the product of someone else’s sweat.
Whatever their meanings, if they had any, they were

_ well-received, which might just be the important thing.

Powder—puff football debacle a disgrace, not a step forward for equality

The Midwest, the United States
and the world have been riveted
recently by some of the most sick,
twisted and despicable actions
teenagers could inﬂict on their peers.

In Northbrook, Ill., a wealthy and
mostly white suburb of Chicago, a
“ritual” powder-puff football game
between juniors and seniors of
Glenbrook North High School went
terribly awry.

Rather than playing with the
pigskin, the seniors decided to play
with pig guts — and fish guts, and
human and animal feces. The seniors
also substituted punches for tackles,
mercilessly beating juniors and leav-
ing several injured — one with a
broken ankle and another needing 10
stitches.

There was plenty of beer to drive

' the senior girls and sedate the con-

sciences of alumni and other, mostly
male, bystanders.

The toughest part of watching,
reading and interpreting these events
is deciding which aspect is the most
morally reprehensible.

Is it the willingness and ease
with which the seniors inflicted such
humiliation and injury on the
juniors? What about the lack of ini-
tiative or a moral compass displayed
by the bystanders — their refusal to
stand up for the juniors, say enough
is enough, or tell the seniors to their
faces that what they were doing was
wrong? Or is it that parents have
been charged with buying the beer

‘of the seniors and those

that fueled the madness? I have to
say no to all of these.

The most terrible and saddening
thing is that people from all walks of
life, from students to parents to pro-
fessional op-ed columnists, are
attempting to play down,
defend or excuse what
happened in an attempt to
diminish the culpability

who watched.

Seeing these or any
other events in retrospect,
and not recognizing how
blatantly wrong and

in a wealthy, suburban community
value pageantry above teaching their
kids moral accountability, and that
actions have consequences.

As long. as the ridiculously
wealthy are more equal than others
before the law, it may be
too much to ask their chil-
dren to have a proper
understanding of human
-dignity and equality. If
you’re wondering where
the values — or lack
thereof —— that allowed
such sadism to occur
came from, try starting at

wrenching thing about all Worst of all, profes-
of this. sionals, presumably reasonable and
It’s indicative of diminished intelligent adults, have come to the

moral capacities and a saddening
inability to tell the difference
between right and wrong — or to
have the conviction to act‘ on those
beliefs.

When asked about the events,
one student responded, “It’s not like
she’s dead.” Apparently, we as a
society have become so desensitized
by violence that only mortal wounds
can violate a person’s dignity.

Parents have taken protests to the
school board and have had lawyers
file suits to prevent suspensions or
expulsions. This way, their kids can
still attend the senior prom and walk

‘defense of the seniors. Chicago Sun

Times columnist Debra Pickett’s
May 9 commentary was “Girls can
dish it and take it. Gotta Problem?”
.While Pickett conceded that
things did get a bit too rough, she
argued that girls are now doing what
we expect of boys’ — hazing each
other and behaving ‘violently. Pickett
found nothing wrong with.the fact
that teenage girls were “amused” by
such events, rather than perturbed.
Pickett smugly notes, “They
[teen girls] also, apparently, spend

the occasional Sunday afternoon in a ~

forest preserve, pounding the crap
out of each other  They’ve learned
to play like the boys.”

(

.women’s
human dignity sickens me.

What Pickett omits is that what
happened would be equally wrong if
it were male seniors hazing male
juniors.

Pickett misses the boat. The
equality she cherishes is not a rela-
tive principle, but one derived from a
universal dignity or inviolability that
each person, man or woman, pos-
sesses. .-

If Pickett really understood what

equality meant, she’d be arguing that

hazing is wrong, period. - .
Rather than taking the high road
and arguing that it’s wrong _for any-
one to haze anyone else, she asks that
itbe okay for girls to haze girls and,

consequently, _for anyone to haze-

anyone. That Pickett would so
thoughtlessly place her notion of
empowerment

Thirty-one expulsions and 15
criminal charges are not what Pickett
condescendingly terms “arbitrary
adult justice._” , *

They are the only ways to teach
the seniors accountability, and to
defend the dignity that true equality,

not Pickettfs misguided equality, .

rests upon. - ,
The fact that anybody, especially

‘ adults, parents and successful colum-

nists, could misunderstand this sad-
dens me the most.

“haze” is purple. .E-mail him at

Treasures of the sea

Finding Nemo proves once
again that Pixar is  
unstoppable  

Finding Nemo .
Starring Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres
Directed by Andrew Stanton

ikvikvik A

CHAD EBERLE
Staff Writer

The folks at Pixar Animation Studios.have cre-
ated yet’ another wondrous computer-animated
adventure. ,

“Finding Nemo” is their best—1ooking work to
date. The human characters are still a little off, but
everything under the sea looks magnificent.
Screenfuls of colorful marine life — everything
animated down to the freaking molecule — are
almost an overload. I ~

Single parent Marlin (Albert Brooks), actually
a Clown ‘Fish who — to the disappointment of
everyone he meets — just isn’t funny, is overpro-

tective of his son, Nemo.
When Marlin tries to tag
along on the boy’s first
day of school, a frustrat-
ed Nemo ventures into
open waters, where he’s
snatched by a scuba
diver and added to a fish
tank in a dentist’s office.
Marlin frantically teams
up with Dory (Ellen
DeGeneres), a regal blue
tang with no short-term

memory, to scour the
ocean in search of
Nemo.

As always, Pixar

lends its technology to an intelligent, funny, excit-
ing script. The film doesn’t just look good —- it is
good. Heck, the “Nice Sharks Anonymous” meet-
ing is one of the best comedy bits I’ve seen in any

film in a while. And," even if “Nemo” never quite‘

reaches the pitch of, say, the million—closet-doors
finale of “Monsters, Inc.” or the airport conveyor
belts sequence in “Toy Story 2,” it’s\still got may-
hem to spare. ‘

Also typical of the studio, the voice work is top

notch. Most notably, the film features a quintessen-
tially nervous Albert Brooks performance —— the
best he’s given in years. Standouts from the
immensely talented supporting cast include Barry
Humphries as a shark named Bruce —_—— a sly “Jaws”
nod —— and director Andrew Stanton as Crush, the
turtle equivalent of Bill or Ted. Even DeGeneres
steps up; she’s a perfect ﬂighty fish.

Sorry, “Matrix,” “Finding Nemo” is this sum-
mer’s eye—popper.

I admit it:l really love the wicked ‘80s

The ‘80s gave birth to a plethora
of great things — killer pop music,
rocking metal hair bands, thrilling
slasher movies, My Little Pony,
“You Can’t'Do That On Television”
and me. Twenty-some years -later,
much like past retro comebacks, the
“80s are back and just as good as
ever. . .

Thankfully, there are many out-
lets for a person to indulge in the rad
decade. And I confess —— I indulge
without a second thought.

A few months ago, I proclaimed
myself anti-club‘, preferring the bars
of the South Side. That was before I

discovered Chemistry, in the Strip. .

Never a cover charge, and always
playing the coveted ‘80s music, this
place, is perfect for an anti-dancer
like me. But I dance. I ﬂail my arms
and legs about with total lack of
rhythm. When ‘80s music is playing,
it’s next to impossible to make a
dancing fool_ of yourself. I had
almost forgotten about the original
versions of “Total Eclipse of the
Heart,” “Relax”, and “Let’s Go

Crazy.”

VH1 takes a look
back at the’ vpre—Mariah
Carey era with its series
“I Love the 803.” Each
episode looks at’ one
year, in depth. It’s all
about ‘80s pop culture:
the music, the fashion —
which wasn’t exactly
stellar —- the lingo, the

‘babes, the hunks and

more. Big names like
Dan Savage and Andrew
Dice Clay pitch in their two cents
about the decade.

Stainless is a local ‘80s_metal
cover band. I first saw them at
Margaritaville in the South Side.
Every song they perform sounds this'
close to the original. That night, my
friends Josh, Corie and I decked our-
selves out inv‘80s digs. Crimped
hair, blue eye shadow and even
Electric Youth perfume were our.

_‘80s accessories. With the exception

of the drummer, who sports a real
mullet, the other members of the

 

Column like we
see ‘em

Katie Mavrich

band don wigs to com-
plete their ‘80s looks.
Having seen them several
times in recent months, I
can honestly say that they
are as good as metal
revival can get.

_ Deja Vu, a martini
bar in the Strip, has
“Ladies and ‘80s” every
Thursday night. In addi-
tion to frugal drink spe-
cials with an abundant‘
amount of alcohol —- mar-
tini bar, folks — anyone can get all
dolled up, ‘80s style. Hair stylists
and makeup artists are on hand to
give you a Flock of Seagulls hairdo
or the Madonna face. Of course, the
soundtrack for the night is all ‘80s
music. Not everyone sports ‘80s
clothes, but those who do, pull it off
so well that it’s hard not to wonder if
they dress like that all the time.

Anything that has anything to» do
with the marvelous decade sparks
my interest. However, as culturally
clued in as I am, I do make mistakes

from time to time. Actual arguments
have ensued between my fellow
‘80s-loving friends and me. As we
were on our way to.Deja Vu last
week, we began talking about the
song “Laid,” by James. It’s such a

good song, emitting a strong ‘80s _ p

vibe, that I assumed that it was from
the ‘80s. Corie backed me up on
this, as did our other friend, Joe.
“It’s not from the ‘80s,” Josh
kept insisting.
All was forgotten until I woke up

the next‘ morning and checked my

voice mail, only to find that Josh did
a little late—night research and found
that the song had, in fact, come out
in 1993.

Hey, I never said I knew it all.
But what I do know is this: in 10
years, when the ‘90s are revived, I
am going to feel old. But for now, I
can look back with nostalgia on a
time when Rainbow Brite was my

hero, bigger hair was better, and‘

Bret Michaels and Vince Neil were
so hot that they seemed to give off
smoke.

A Really Super Book About

Graham Taylor

2003-

‘»".1"i‘r7fr 1/2

If you looked out your kitchen

window every day and saw the same‘

squirrel, you would feel connected
to it. If you looked forward to seeing
thesquirrel every day, you would try
to befriend it. If you thought about
the squirrel all the time, so much

that you wrote a book about it, you_

would be Graham Taylor.

“A Really Super Book About
Squirrels” is a short yet hilarious
read about Taylor and his squirrelly
endeavors. Honestly, stop and think
about this: a man wrote a book about
something so random that, when
people see it, they’ll have to flip
through the pages. You don’t even
have to have an opinion about the
furry little

know who Mitch Hedberg is, this
doesn’t mean much to you.lQuick
lesson: no contractions, short, quick
statements and, of course, random
thoughts from all over the place,
convening in one — that’s Mitch.’
Accompanying the crudely writ-

ten text are crudely drawn illustra— .

tions by Taylor’s friend, Graham
Roumieu. And then there is the main
character, Jimmy the Squirrel. What
he thinks of this project is unknown,
because, as Taylor points out, he
can’t talk.

There are many reasons to read
this book: it contains a squirrel
haiku, it will certainly serve as a
pick—me-up on a gloomy day and,
above all, it’s a conversation piece.
“A Really Super Book About

Don’t let them steal

The Italian Job
Starring Mark Wahlberg,
Charlize Theron, Edward
Nonon

Directed by F. Gary Gray
<3: it

Another remake. God help us.

The original “Italian Job,” starring
Michael Caine in his prime, is consid-
ered a classic caper ﬁlm.

The new one, coming up with
everything else of old in Hollywood’s
current streak of bulimia, is so middling
that itcomes off more reprehensibly than most ﬁlms that tip
the scale to all—the—way bad.

This time around, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and
his crew of thieves (Seth Green, Jason Statham and Mos Def)
are double—crossed after stealing a safe ml] of gold. The open-
ing sequence, which offers a remarkably dull boat chase
through the canals of Venice, clues the audience in on how the
boys will pull off the heist later, as though we wouldn’t com-
prehend the idea if we saw it just once. Steve (Edward
Norton) not only takes all the gold, he kills Croker’s mentor
and safecracker, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland, collecting
a quick paycheck).

Jump to a year later — Charlie has located Steve in
Hollywood and sets out to recruit Bridger’s daughter, Stella
(Charlize Theron), who can crack safes like her dad, to help

him steal back the gold. From here, the ﬁlm becomes a big
commercial for those cute little MINI Coopers that can cruise
through any tight—-space.

Wahlberg and Theron are par for themselves, but a cou-
ple of actors are uncharacteristically bad. Green tries in vain
to squeeze laughs out of his character’s grating insistence that
he’s the rightful inventor of Napster. Sadly, all that can be said
for the usually—exciting Norton is that he has a moustache. ’

Even director F. Gary Gray has misplaced his edge. He’s
proven in the past that he can be reasonably successful with
comedy —— he’s responsible for the cult of “Friday”'— and
suspense —“Tl1e Negotiator” — but neither laughs nor thrills
hit here. _ ’

Stick to good policy and rent the original.

John Hammond
Friday, 7 p.m.,- 10 p.m.
Moondog’s, $20

All Ages

(412) 323-1919

Blues crooner John Hammond is
almost a senior citizen, with more than
40 years of musical experience behind
him. He has released 25 studio albums
and is still going strong. On his latest,
Readyfor Love, his fans get to hear his
first try at penning the tunes he sings.

Hammond has a penchant for
revamping others’ music. His 2001
release, Wicked Grin, was composed
entirely of his pal Tom Waits’ songs.
On Ready for Love, Waits lends “Gin
Soaked Boy” and “Low Side of the
Road.” Also contributing rights to
their songs are George Jones, Jesse
Stone, and Mick Jagger and Keith
Richards with the early Rolling Stones
tune, “Spider and the Fly.” Producer
David Hidalgo of the Mexican-inﬂu-
enced rock band Los Lobos gets more

-.. ,,_..._....... V. .¢--¢...~,; e .r. .._,.r: , .

than production credits here; his
moniker appears on “No Chance” and
“I Brought the Rain.”

Hammond’s first songwriting
credit is “Slick Crown Vic,” a tune he
wrote after his wife told him he had to
write a song. It’s a tribute of sorts to
his 1955 Ford Crown Victoria. Slow
and a little twangy, it fits his signature
covering style fairly well — except,» of

a course, it isn’t something that he just

performs.

His voice is almost hauntingly
deep and it meshes extremely well
with his country/bluesy music. It’s
infused with guitars, slow percussion
beats, banjos and a harmonica, the
instrument of the blues. His style
won’t make you wallow in self—pity,
but it might make you reach for a bour-
bon on the rocks, if you’re really get-
ting into the spirit of things.

It’s easy to picture Hammond
onstage in a small, smoky club, sitting
on a stool, pouring his — er, others’ —
heart and soul into the songs he per-
forms. But you don’t have to leave this
all up to imagination. Blues club
Moondog’s hosts this legend of sorts
for not one, but two shows on Friday.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

 

JOE MARCHILENA

Claude Harriott is not the only Pitt

football player who can make it onto the A

watch list for a national award.

On Tuesday, offensive tackle Rob
Petitti was named to the Outland Trophy
‘watch list, an award given to the best inte-
rior lineman in_ college football.

Petitti, who enters his junior season at
Pitt having started 25 straight games’ atleft
tackle, was one of two,,sophomore offen-
sive linemen to earn All-Big East honors
last season. »

Asa redshirt freshman, Petitti made

2001. ‘ '

Petitti had one of his best games that

season against Syracuse, holding pass ~
‘ rushing sensation Dwight Freeney to zero

sacks. Now in the National Football
League with Indianapolis, Freeney had
recorded at least one sack in 15 straight
games before going against Petitti;

  Petitti named toOut

preseason football poll with Pitt ranked
No. 9 in the nation-

With 17 returning starters, the
Panthers were described as a “program on
the rise, and there is no ceilingfor this
year’s talented andexperienced team.”
The magazine featured wide receiver
Larry Fitzgerald on its Eastern. edition
cover and called him “one of the most
electrifying receivers in the ‘game on any
level.” Harriott and Petitti were also rec-
ognized as surefire All-Americans.

ors after batting a career—best .342 with 68
hits and 49 runs during his senior season.
He ﬁnished his career at Pitt as the
school’s all—time leader in walks and sec-
ond in career at-bats, hits, runs scored and

Earning his second straight all—con-
ference honor, Spamer was also named to
the second team. The junior led Pitt in bat-
ting, runs scored, hits, stolen bases and

After hitting .332 with 64 hits and 36

because they both already have 12 teams, divided into two
divisions, and conference championships.

Here are some ideas for what the other four confer-
ences could look like. '

 

ACC: After the conference officially adds Miami, Boston
College and Syracuse, the tough part becomes how to align
the 12 teams into two divisions.

The four North Carolina schools (Duke, North
Carolina, Wake Forest and NC State) have already stated
that they would like to stay together, so an East-West or

have played in the conference title game in 2002. My guess
is that Miami would have won.

Big East: The name will have to change, but for now, let’s
call it the Big East.

Pitt, West Virginia, Virginia Tech, Rutgers and
Connecticut are still members, which means that, in order
to get to 12 teams, the conference is goingto have to raid
somebody else’s conference.

‘ Let’s start by taking Cincinnati, Louisville, Memphis
and South Florida from Conference USA, and Central
Florida from the Mid-American Conference. .

But that doesn’t give the conference enough credibili-
ty. However, if Penn State were convinced to leave the Big
Ten and Notre Dame were told it’d be left out of the play-
offs because it’s not in a conference, then it would work.

Neither of these is very likely to happen, but let’s pre-

tend that they could.

fixed with a little money

The New York Yankees have lost
ﬁve games in a row, including a four-
game sweep at the hands of the Toronto
Blue Jays.

Is it time to panic? Not according to

Contreras should be in the starting rota-
tion and Weavershould return to the

Yankees owner George‘
Steinbrenner. Steinbrenner
told the New York Post he
believes that manager Joe
Torre will straighten out
the team.

After getting off to a

season. Yankee Stadium is supposed to
be an intimidating place to play, so
what’s the problem? Are the Yankees
doomed?

No. Their 18-3. record to start the W

season is the best in the franchise’s his‘-
tory. As much as it pains me to admit it, \
the Yankees have just hit a bump in the
road. ‘ x a
They are paying their dues for get-

. ting off to such an impressive start.

They just happened to have been play-
ing a large portion of their games at
home when their skid began. '
The Yankees also have not had a
healthy lineup. .
Mariano Rivera started the season
on the disabled list, Derek Jeter was put
out for about six weeks on opening day »
due to a shoulder injury, and when he
did get back, Bernie Williams went
down with an injury. Nick Johnson has
also made a trip to the disabled list.
After playing above expectations in
spite of their injuries, the Yankees are

‘playing like a team that is banged up.

The main question marks surround
their pitching staff. Mike Mussina,
David Wells and Roger Clemens have
pitched well, for the most part, this sea-
son, but Andy Pettitte and Jeff Weaver
have not been as good. V ”

Steinbrenner went out and got
Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras, who can
also start. Contreras struggled early on,
but Steinbrenner conceded in an inter-

coming to the ends of their careers, so _

Colon could be a long-term answer. The
Yankees would not be giving up on
Weaver and Contreras. These players
are important pieces of the ‘puzzle for
the future. , '

Ken Griffey Jr. is also a name that
comes up. A healthy Griffey would be a
nice ﬁt for the Yankees, but is also a
huge risk because of his injury prob-
lems. Once Williams comes back, they
could split time between center ﬁeld
and designated hitter.

Vladimir Guerrero is the player
who I think would be best for the
Yankees. The Expos might lose him
anyway, and they should at least get
something for him. Like Griffey,
Guerrero-» could rotate in the outﬁeld
and could be the designated hitter for
some games.

Steinbrenner has a huge—wallet, so
the Yankees will regain momentum,
even if it means he has to go on anoth-
er one of his spending sprees. Once the
Yankees figure out their pitching rota-
tion and Jason Giambi gets on track,
look for the Yankees to reclaim first

' place in the American League East.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports edi-
tor for The Pitt News and, after reading
this column, don ’t get it twisted. He still
hates the Yankees, and is just one of
many journalists oﬁering insight into
what‘ is going on with them and how
they can get back on track. ‘

Changing playoff format opens opportunities

Marchilena, page 11

Of course, by expanding to 12 teams in
football, the ﬁve basketball—on1y schools
(Georgetown, Villanova, Seton Hall,
Providence and St. John’s) would have to
be excluded.

The divisions then could be broken up
into East and West with Virginia Tech,

South Florida, PSU, Rutgers, UConn and '

Central Florida in the East and Pitt, W V U,

’ Notre Dame, Memphis, Louisville and

Cincinnati in the West.

Under this format, Notre Dame and
Virginia Tech would have played in the
conference championship last year, and
let’s assume Notre Dame would have won.

I Big_Ten: This conference also needs a new
name, but anyone that can count already,

knew that.

Having, in the course of this scenario,
lost one member and another potential one
to the conference formerly known as the
Big East, the Big Ten will have to do a little

raiding of its own.

Northern Illinois, from the MAC,
would join the West division, along with
Iowa, Illinois, Northwestern, Minnesota
and Wisconsin, while Marshall, also from

- the MAC, would team up with Ohio State,
‘ Indiana, Michigan, Michigan State and

Purdue to form the East.
Iowa and Ohio State would have met

\ in the conference championship, with the

Buckeyes most likely walking away with a
win.

Paciﬁc 10: Not much to do here, other than
add two teams from the west coast. Based
on the way their football and basketball
teams performed last year, Hawaii and
Fresno State could make the jump.

Since the 12 teams are crammed up
against the coastline, it would be easier to
make the divide between the North and the
South.

_ So Oregon, Oregon State, Washington,
Washington State, Stanford and Fresno
State would be in the North, and the South
would contain Arizona, Arizona State,
Hawaii, Southern Cal, UCLA and
California. . I»

The conference championship would
have been between Washington State and
USC, 4 and, judging by the season the
Trojans had in 2002, USC probably would
have won.

So now that we have six conferences,
what should be done with all the bowl
games? '

Last year, there were 28 bowl games,_

27 of which were pointless in determining
who the national champion would be.

- For the eight—team playoff, there would
need to be seven games. So let’s use the
four BCS bowls (Rose, Orange, Sugar and
Fiesta) along with the Gator, Cotton and
Liberty bowls. As with the BCS champi-

surtncurs

We know how it is.

onship game, the bowls could rotate so the
national title game would be played in a
different location every year. '

As for the other 21 bowls, and any oth-
ers that will be created in the future, they
could be run the same way they always
have been. I

That way, more than 40 teams would
still get the opportunity to make the money
that comes from playing in a bowl game,
not to mention have a shot at winning a
postseason game.

So, not only would each conference
make money with the extra teams and con-
ference title game, but all of the bowls
would still be in place, which means the
schools would be making money as well.
And the two teams that advance to the title
game would make more money because
they would play in three bowl games.

However, there are a few ﬂaws in this
system. The Division I—A teams, who are
not in one of the six conferences, will never
have a shot at winning a national title. But
even under the current system, they have
no chance of winning, so not much
changes.

There is also the problem that this
would cause for college basketball, but
that’s a whole other story, and this column
is already too long as it is.

Joe Marehilena is the sports editor for The
Pitt News and he will discuss college bas-
ketball next week if you really want him to.
