State Needs ‘ c
To Train 25

As Librarians

“Book “starvation” in Pennsylva-
nia small towns has sent the Com-
monwealth on an unusual quest
for employees. The state wants to
hire 25 college graduates at sal-
aries of $4100 for a public service,
going to library school for a year.

Dean Harold Lancour of the
University’s new Graduate Li-
brary School is participating,
along with librarians all over the

state, in the search for candidates.

The University is one ofifour
institutions approved by the state
to educate the new recruits. All
applications must be at the State
Library in‘ Harrisburg by June
5th, Lancour stated.

Must Agree. ‘

The candidates, having complet-
ed their graduate education at the
library school, must agree to work
for two years in a small-town pub-
lic library. Salary for the new
librarians will average over $5000
in this phase of the plan, accord-
ing to Dean Lancour.

Lancour, who will supply in-
formation about the program
to interested persons in this
area, stated, “Librarians make im-
portant choices in building a bal-
anced collection for a community.
Few people realize how much the
librarians’ selections affect the at-
titudes their children develop.
Only time and imagination limit‘
the librarians’ horizons.” A

The morning-long briefing was
conducted by Dr. Kenneth Snyder,
who heads the African desk of

Homecoming

Revitalization

Off-Campus Dances,
Return to Floats
Suggested to Group

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Senator Larry ShermanVre-
ported on the work he has ac-
complished so far’ as Home-
caming Chairman to the Stu-
dent Government at its meet-
ing last Thursday evening.

In a prepared address, which
occupied ‘most of the time of the
meeting, Sherman stated that
“many changes from last year’s
Homecoming would be necessary
for a successful weekend.’’ ,

The most important conclusion
which Sherman had arrived at

order to re-vitalize interest in
Homecoming, “campus organiza-
tions return to building floats,
rather than decorate fraternity
and dormitory house-fronts.”

Cost No-More
Sherman added that the floats
would cost no more than the

as much annoyance to neighbors.

Also needed for giving Home-
Coming a “shot in the arm,” ac-
cording to Sherman, are a dance
off-campus, rather than in the
Commons Room, brunches, float
parade, less party-hopping and
more support from Greeks and
independents alike, as well as
the possibility of the appearance
of night club entertainers.

The major problem facing
Homecoming, the eight SG mem-
bers present agreed with Sher-
man, was where to hold the dance.
Various suggestions were made,
but no place was officially chosen.

In other business, the Senators
unanimously Chose Dilly Zambano
for chairman of Parent’s Week-
end. President Tom Olofson pro-
posed that work be continued on
studying effects of the trimester.

meeting by Nathan Firestone, SG

Speaker Finds ‘Barb, Force, Intimacy’

M'cHugh Observes Irish Satire

By JIM IIUFNAGEL

The satiric bard, said Roger
lvlc-Hugh at last Wednesdays Mid-
day, was the Irish Pied Piper.
Piping the railling Gaelic metre
he was such a master at, he plung-
ed the souls of his enemies and
their followers into the engulfing
‘waters of human shame.

all clerics, monairchs who refused

those ingralies who balked at pro-
viding the handouls on which he
lived.

The b1l.l‘(ll(' trzidition has con-
tinued to the present. Mcﬂugh
observed that “Swift carries the
sense of offended authority ap-
pealing to the people outside
itself. He was expert at the
dcadnan argument which allows

an attitude. to destroy itself of
its own weight."

"Mcliugh called Go1ds.mil.h,
Sheridan, Wilde, and Shaw, “lit-
erary sinvaclers into the English

In conclusion, the University of

A leaf-like lichen growing lo-
cally on large boulders above
the 20OO—fo0t elevations in Penn-
sylvania’s mountainous L a u r a l
Ridge and Cool<’s Forest regions
will be tested to determine its
effects on uncontrolled cell
growth. _

Technically tcrrned ”Umbilicara/

substance which halls the growlli
of bothghighter and .‘ower plants.
The $8,171 allotted for first years

to extract the most active ingredi~
ents from the lichen, identify them
chemically, and ‘then determine
their effect on malignant animal

Trial b y I-'ire  

_ The spiral of fall freshman enrollment predictions has
taken its -annual downward twist. In 1960, 1,350 freshmen
entered the University. Last spring planners anticipated
1,600; 1,100 accepted. Latest word this yearis that there will
be 900 newcomers next fall. »

Of the 900'expected, 842_applicant_s have accepted and
paid their admission fee. The 842 figure represents those
interested in attending the University out of approximately
2,000 who have been accepted. 1,000 were rejected. _

A number of reasons have been advanced for the per-
ennial enrollment decrease, but planners are still faced with
the stark fact that it is decreasing. ,

One of the more interesting statistics among the above
is the 1,000 or so who have been rejected. They are proof
that the University refuses to abandon its stringent admis-
sions criteria even in the face of an ever more desperate
situation. These would-be students were refused‘ admission
either on the basis of their general high school academic

record, the results of their College Board scores, or a com-

bination of both. They could not, the admissions officers
felt, handle courses of the calibre which the University
offers. _

But as nearly any teacher will readily admit, there is
no infallible yardstick which will accurately measure future
academic success. Some students are slow starters and
‘motivation’ is always an unknown. No admissions,officer,

at Pitt or elsewhere, will pretend that everyone of those-

he has turned down could not handle college-level work.
Johnstown College, the University’s junior college‘ at

Johnstown, Pa., is experimenting with a program which

helps to allay fears that competent students mayehave been

_ rejected and which may also provide one way of making,

up the /deﬁcit in lean enrollmentlyears--without sacriﬁcing
admissions standards". '
The plan_is called ‘The College Skills Evaluation Pro-
gram’, or,‘in student terminology, ‘Trial by Fire.’ Using the
same admissions requirements as the University, they select-

- ed those‘ qualified. They then made the ‘Trial by Fire’ pro-

gram available to any student who was not admitted but
had completed the proper number of Carnegie units and
satisfied all requirements necessaryfor graduation from his

' high school.

Under Trial by Fire, a student enters a ten week, ten

‘credit course of study very much similar to conditions he

would encounter in the first term of his freshman year. ‘He
takes Introductory English, History of Western Civilization
and a four credit laboratory science or mathmatics course.
If, at the conclusion of the ten weeks, he has earned aC or
better inevery-course, he is admitted’ to the ‘College and
receives credit for the courses he has successfully complet-

ed. If he does not achieve a C in every course, he is not

admitted. » I -
First trial of Trial by Fire occurred last summer and

' . 60 percent of its 33 participants emerged un.scorched.

“We consider the program most successful and are
trying it again this summer,” said Donald Swarts, dean of

“Johnstown College. Dr. Swarts remarked that the College

Skills.EVa1uation Program was undertaken on an experi-
mental basis to determine if college board scores have any
relation to college work and estimated that “in almost every
high school in this area there are 2 or 3 students to which
such a program applies.”

Perhaps many of the University’s rejected 1,000 might
be willing to undergo a similar trial by fire. Their ex-
perience might well keep the home fires burning as brightly
as they are now without losing any more fuel.

only the last few years, a sound hysterical as
crickets in summer thunder is suddenly the new
pain, and the jet transport has become that symbol
which even in a dead still looks somehow stricken
to a relevant motion. I once saw the noses of
these wonders nuzzled beneath the Pan-Am toad-
stool at Idlewild, and they suggested only one
thing to me. Ifound myself expecting the planes
at any moment to break the huddle and abruptly
make that step into the air they do —- that abrupt-
ness also somehow grandly appropriate to this age.
Gypsy in Men

The important fact is that there has always
been this symbol of the adventuresome, perhaps the
restless gypsy in men; and the important question
is what does it represent. I propose a possible an-
swer in this way: Consider the trips you have
taken. Which isolated phases of thewhole sequence
have been the most emotionally impacted? The
departure and the arrival, of course; either astutely
solitary or loud with friends, these times of ending
and beginning, seem to ‘be the most fevered. No
matter how soulfully heroic the sudden aloneness
in the dim mountains may have been, or how

spiritually cathartic the morning sea was to the‘
traveler, that ritual of departure, of ending, of .
pants and starting again is ﬁner, .-

zipping up one’s
deeper. ' .

I think, then, that the symbol might represent
the wish to do that thing which is realistically im-

possible to do in life: to ﬁnish completely and in.

Escapism? - ‘ _
But this is escapism, you say. Certainly it-is,

but doesn’t escape require a certain ‘courage? And-H’

doesn’t escape imply a cognizance of a principle
of rot? The aim of escape, even at its worst, is
betterment, a need to move or change away from
an already putrid situation into a fresh, more satis-
fying state. In actuality, this is the basis of all that
is called under progress. Suppose a developing
process - any prpcess, a mind, a life, an ethical

code -— attempted to continue to contain itself with- , l

in the frame that ﬁt at a given time. The develop-
ment must then stop and remain static within that
frame or reach a point where the frame and per-
haps it too ﬁy-I apart like ravens thrown up from

.a corpse that indelicately burst. ‘Successful devel-

opment requires, then, that courage and willing-
ness to discard systematically.

But’ also is there notthe further implication of
a completion, of a fulﬁllment of an absolutely per-
fect state. And herein lies the great dream of man,
to be like a god, to walk like one among the moun-
tains, to step like one across seas, and even to ﬂy
like oneicoming in with the tongues of thunder.

Coach Lewis
Pushed Foes
Around Once

By JIM O’BRIEN

BOBBY LEWIS, the clock-
watcher whose hand controls
time at the Field House, has
turned back the hands of time
at Pitt to the days not so long
ago when the
athletic face
here was hon-
orable.

The Panth-
ers, spanking-
boys for all
needy teams,
have s a V e (1
face on the
baseball ﬁeld.
‘ Coach Lewis,

highly p e r -
turbed at your writer earlier
in the year when we had il- ’
lusions of grandeur for him,
made the dream castles stand
solid.

In a year of mediocrity for foot-
ball, track, x-country, golf, gym
and basketball, baseball has glori-
ﬁed the school to some extent, and
nursed some wounds that have
carried over from other sports.

Can Compete

In an era when Duquesne, Penn
State and West Virginia thrash
Pitt in nearly everything, it is
refreshing to ﬁnd that we ﬁnally
cam compete with them on a dia-
mond.

Lewis beat a WVU team
twice, a combine that won the
Southern‘ Conference title, and

we were‘ estatic over his 10-0
lacing of the Dukes. It was al-
most as good as the tennis
team’s 9-0 win over the same
foe.

He must beat a formidable State
team twice to have a chance at

it. He didn’t have to be a Stengel
to get this far, but be worried
about winning.

His main concern wasn’t his
standing in the intra-club gin
tourney or linksmanship during
the recruiting days. The latter
may be a private joke, but so are
the losing teams.

Post 0-9 Mark

Golfers After
Their lst Win

Today the Panther golfers will
try to break a losing streak
against St. Vincent College which
stretches from their opening
match to now. Tomorrow they
will close the nightmarish cam-
paign when they host Penn State
at Wildwood Country Club.

Theteam suffered loss number
nine against West Virginia at
their Lakeview Golf Club, 61/2 to
2%.

.Neil Shorthouse covered the par
71 course in 76, sharing medal
honors with Sid Bennett of the
Mountaineers. Ed Wicknick, mov-
ing up a notch in caliber, man-
aged to tie his man with clutch
play on the final two holes with
an 83.

After the West Virginia loss,
Shorthouse said that “Morgan-
town’s golf club has one of the
finest courses that Pitt has played
this year.” But, at this point in
the season, any course that the
Panthers can win on would pro-
bably seem ﬁner.

two arms, a lot of heart, and not

Otherwise he may have given
the Navy track team a closer bat-

Navy scored a whopping 821/;

recorded 141/2 points.

The undefeated Midshipman
took first place in nine of ' the
sixteen events and tied for first
in another, sweeping the shotput,
javeli.n, mile, 880 and two-mile.

Friend won the broad jump and
hgih hurdles, placing second in
the low hurdles and ran on the
winning mile relay team.

Al Thomassey won the discus
with a toss of 154-5;'Jack White-
ford tied for first in the high
jump at 6-2; Vance Carter won
the 440 with a 49.6 clocking, and
Steve Munter copped the 220 in

The defeat leaves Pitt with a

Penn State Games  

May Not Be Played 

By BOB SNIIZIK
. The weatherman may have put a severe crimp into the

‘tournament plans of the Panther baseball nine. The rains
‘~ came hard and long on Saturday and washed-out the sched-

uled doubleheader between the Panthers and Penn State.
After their Thursday loss to Duquesne it looked as
though the Cats needed twin wins over the Lions to impress

may not want

make a trip to Pittsburgh on Wed-

school days.

Star Already Pitched
The Saturday postponement was
doubly bothersome to Coach Bob-
by Lewis’ charges since Penn
State Ace Bob Fenton had pitch-
ed 8 and two-third innings of re-
lief on Thursday. It is doubtful if
the Lions had anyone else to match
against Pitt Star John Carlisle.
Lewis will be close by the
phone today as he is expecting
a call from Penn State telling
him whether the games are on
for Wednesday or not.

 

The loss, last Thursday, to Du-
quesne, was a shocker in light of
Pitt’s _10-0 win over the Dukes
two days earlier.

Rocky Road

Duquesne scored single runs in
the third, fourth and ﬁfth inn-
ings to assume a 3-0 lead against
the pitching of Andy Alex. The
ﬁnal run came when a slow
grounder hit a pebble and bounc-
ed over shortstop Al Riccuiti‘s
head.

The Cats‘ scored a.run in the
seventh and had the bases load-
ed in the ninth with no outs but
could only score once, going
down to defeat, 3-2.

Riccuiti had ‘one of his better
days at the plate with a triple
and three singles and he drove in

Corky Cuthbert Baseball Standout
Despite Heavily Bandaged Knees

By JIM 0’BRlEN

Bob “Corky” Cuthbert is
one Panther athlete who has
snubbed the dance craze call-.
ed “the twist.”

Cuthbert treats his knees
like a rheumatic dowager, and
‘wraps them like they were fresh
gingerbread every afternoon.

He has-good cause for such cau.
tion. In the winter of 1960 he went
under the knife and had cartileges
removed from both of his knees.

Solid Fixture

He sat out last baseball season,
but this year not even a .400 hitter
could keep him out of the lineup.

As a sophomore a year before,
he mangled his kneecaps playing
for the school soccer team,
Cuthbert batted at a .300 clip
during the season and only slip-
ped to .290 in the last two games.

Last week he was surging at the
.351 level, and he Collected-three
hits in a wonderful 10-0 win over
Duquesne.

McKeesport’s Ron Supansic in-—
herited C0rk’s original second base
position this spring, sporting a
plus .400 average. “I shifted Corky
to the outﬁeld,” Coach Bobby
Lewis said, “because there is more

and I don’t want him making

ed ‘deep in their chairs in the
Student Union lobby after they
lost to Duquesne last’ week.

They were silent for the most
part, muttering to themselves.

Weird Game

“Baseball is a strange game,”
Martha said. “You just don’t go
on winning.” His remark was bas-
ed on the team’s nine game" win
streak prior to the loss.

“That team isn't as good as,
half the teams we’ve’played," he
added, “but we didn’t do any-
thing right. I don’t think we
were cocky like Al does. I just
don’t think we were ready.

“We looked horrible ——- it was
the worst game I ever played —
and we made errors and nobody
was hitting. So we lost. I hope
that doesn’t kill our chances of
getting in the NCAA.

“We’ll go next year for sure. I
know everybody’s getting tired of

hearing that sort of thing, but it’s ‘

true. I just hope we cango now.”
