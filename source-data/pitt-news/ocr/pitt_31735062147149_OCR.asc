Scene As Cadets
Prepare For Trip

Tales Told By Upperclassmen,
Here In 1931, Make Pointers
Anxious To Visit City

By C. V. Clifton
Editor, The Pointer
‘Special To The Pitt News
‘Vest Point, Nov. 8-Four special
trains leave \V'est Point tonight at 9
o’clock carrying the entire corps of
cadets, numbering almost sixteen
hundred, to Pittsburgh, the first visit
since 1931. So goes the news story,
but behind this story there is a more
intimate picture of the hopes and an-
ticipatious of every cadet in gray,
keyed up -by the man.y rumors that

vhavepeiieti-ated the gray-walled sanc-

tum, and magniﬁed by the many
glorious st.ories told of that 1931 trip
by upperclassmen now graduated.

The ﬁrst classmeii (seniors to you),
sit at the tables in the mess hall and
recount the many and various stories
told them of that memorable trip to
Pitt, and the underclassmeii sit there
with rapt attention, until their own
(‘.1-earns carry their attention beyond
t-lie realms or "i"'éali's‘i'ﬁ'."

Hospitality unequaled in the annals
of gridiron visits. a ball comparable to
the affairs of the French Royal Court
of old, friendliness everywhere, and,
yes—beautit'ul young ladies by the
hundreds. These are the impressions
gained by our predecessors, and these
are the rumors that spur Army hopes
so high.

The Official Bulletin comes out with
the aniiouiiceinent of the trip itiiier—
ary, what time we leave, what time
we arrive, and how much time be-
tween arriva.l and marching into the
Pitt Stadium. A bit of advice about
traffic coiigestioii, and details of the
ball at the VVilliam Penn that even-
ing. Then numerous “Poop-Sheets,”
as the ofﬁcial papers a.re termed, on
which to sign if you are going to have
guests, or if you are going to dinner,
or if you’re not going to diiiner--
every detail must be recorded. The
oflicial nose-count must go in.

The Pointer, magazine of the Corps,
makes its appearance with a long list
of places to go, and things to do in
the University town, and lots of iii-
formation compiled by the efforts of
many letters written to many sources
of information in Pittsburgh.

Letters to the Corps arrive bearing
invitations of the various Greek let-
ter houses on the campus to Cadet
members. The favored ones fortunate
in their membership at this or that
college formerly attended, meet in
the club room and learn the pleasant
details.

Strongest. indications of a repetition
of the many woiiderful things oﬁ"ered
for the enjoyment of the Corps in
.193]. have appeared. Enthusiasm has
reaclied the peak. The adjutant in
the mess hall sounds off the number
of hours until the Pittsburgh game at

every meal.

The slide rules are put away, the
books neatly aligiiecl on the desks, a
tooth brush, and a pair of P. .T’s
tucked under the arm, and the Corps
of Cadets swings into line, down tho.
hill to the station, chanting, “The
Army Team’s the pride and dream of
every heart in gray.”

VVe’1l see you tomorrow, and hope
you'll like us as much as we know
we’re going to like you.

University Rooters Gather Today‘
To Loose Preliminary Pep Volley

There are no classes scheduled. dur-
ing third hour today.

Instead, students in all undergradu-
ate schools are invited to a pep as-
sembly in Memorial Hall.

The Army comes to town tomorrow,
and this assembly idea is designed to
prepare a cheering section somewhat.
like that of the visitors. So every-
body with a two-decibel voice goes
down to the Hall to cheer, and inci-
dentally listen to speeches and music.

The University band will supply
the tunes. Dr. John B. Sutherland.
varsity football coach, will speak, and
members of the grid squad who play
tomorrow are expected to be grouped
on the platform.

On page two of this issue, students
who attend will ﬁnd valuable the pro-
verbial handy guide—complete cheers,
Alma Mater, and Hail to Pitt, which

will be shouted, sung, and hummed at
the affair.

The SFA committee which has
planned today's invigorator promises
several surprises. These will be

listed as unadvertised features.

It has been announced before, anrl
the statement still holds good, that
the freshmen will sit together in the
center of the auditorium. Around
them will be grouped Pitt Riﬂes.
Dents, ai.id fraternity men. Men and
women not included in these classifi-
cations will ﬁiid room somewhere in
the hall.

Louis Bearer, ChE37, is chairman.

Apropos is the note that, since
cheering will be a. feature, University
cheerleaders will be up in front, too
’l‘hey can be recognized by their
sweaters, unless they wear coats.——I.

peace to be held at the regular session
of Inquiry forum next Vvednesday at
12:30 in Room 107, Alumni Hall.

Dr. W. M. Parrish, professor of pub-

Downey To Head
Freshman Dance

 

Interviews With Six Applicants
Precede Final Selection '

-' ._\ '

John Martin Downey, BA, was
named chairman of the annual Fresh-
man Dance by the Executive Commit-
tee of S=F~A at a meeting Wednesday.

Downey, together with ﬂve other

. candidates, recommended by the Ap-

pointments Committee, was interview-
ed by the Executive Committeebefore
the choice was made. The other can-
didates, Bernard Cashdollar, BA, Rob-
ert Culp, C, Bernard McKenna, C, Jay
Reich, BA, and .Earl Riley, C, were
selected along with Downey from a
record group of 66 aspirants.

The new dance chairman is a mem-
ber of the Campus Chest Committee,
a member of Pittsburgh Business In-
stiute, and a candidate for Pitt Riﬂes.

Peace Meeting Resolution

During the Executive meeting the
following resolution was proposed and
unanimously adopted regarding a pro-
posed peace meeting today:

“Inasmuch as the Executive Coin-
niittee was planning an Army pep-
meeting before the subject of a peace

meeting was introduced at an assem-

bly meeting, and since the division of
an l1our"s meeting into a pep—meeting
and a peace meeting would prove im-
practical, the request for a- 30-minute
time for a peace meeting is declined.”

Student Alliance Group
To Discuss Peace Today

Discussion of the Student Mobili-
zation for Peace will feature the Fri-
day afternoon meeting at 12:30
o'clock in Room 1. Y Hut, of the Stu-
dent Alliance. The organization is

tive Committee of SFA.

Reverend Frank E. Smith of the

Pitt, Army Teams
To Battle . Before
60,000 At Stadium

Panthers Seek To Hit Winning
Stride Against Cadet Eleven;
Visitors A-re Experienced

By Harry Robinson

Can the Army, beaten once, ﬁght
again?

Can a Panther, wnose claws grasp-
ed nothing but thin air a week ago,
come back to use those claws with
the ferocity for which it is noted?

Ushers will be using shoe-horiis to
put into the. Stadium tomorrow after-
noon all the folks who think they can. '

Before that battle begins, at 2
o’clock, there are several more rather
important questions which may be
had for the asking.

Will the Panther backs be able to
make much headway through the
strong Cadet forward wall? Will the
Arin_v’s inuch—lieralded Monk Meyer
continue to haunt the opposition with
his accurate passing, kicking and ball-
carrying? How will Pitt’s inexpe-
rienced sophomores show up against
the host of Army veterans? Will
Frank Pa.trick’s talented place—kicking

game? Will Coach Sutherland’s out-
ﬁt surprise the soldiers with a spec-
tacular passing attack like the one
that completely befuddled the West
Pointers in 1931?
Cadets Want Revenge

One thing is certain. The Cadets
ha.ve a better chance of taking the
'Panther’s hide tomorrow than in
either of the previous two games
played. In 1931 the Cadets came to
Pittsburgh with a crackerjack outﬁt,
probably a bit overconfident, and re-
ceived a severe jolting when the
Panthers opened up with an aerial at-
tack that few defenses could have
stopped.

When the Army was prepared for
a running attack or a punt, the Blue
and Gold boys would ﬂing a pass;
and when the Cadets were set to stop
a pass play, the Sutherland machine
would run the ‘ball. That was the
way things moved along that after-
noon, and the ﬁnal score read 26 for
Pitt, 0 for Army.

In 1932, the Soldiers were on the
verge of a hard-foiight victory, lead-
ing the Panthers 13-12 in the third
quarter, but the Pitt eleven stayed
off the threat with another six-pointer
and ca.ine back to Pittsburgh with an
18-13 triumph.

The Cadets remember these two
defeats all too well. and despite any
bear stories from Vvest Point, New
York, to the contrary, the Army wants
to win that ball game tomorrow.

On the other hand, the Panthers
will have plenty to say about the sit-
uation tomorrow. Coach Sutherland's
eleven has compiled a better-than-av-
erage record up to date, and would
be among the top teams in the coun-
try today if a certain Mr. Peters had
failed to kick a ﬁeld goal in the Pitt-

Irish struggle. While the showing

Gamma Delta, has been selected as
chairman.
.T1ie *..irn_s..f.c.>...1t the...1'eI>01'tins of any
infractions of the rushing rules was
discussed, but was dropped when the
council agreed that any change made
at this time would not be feasible.

A cheering section for fraternity
men at the Army game tomorrow, ac-
cording to Edward Durkin, C36, Kappa
Sigma, president, ha.s been set aside.
and each fi'at.ernit.y will send two
pledges to aid in reserving these
seats. .

It was also decided to have all fra-
ternity eniployes examined periodic-
ally at the Falk Clinic, pending the
cooperation of the Student Health

danced to probably the best band in
Sopli Hop aniials.” He refers, of
course. to the music of Archie Bleyer,
and his network and recordiiig orches-

THERES SOMETHING DIFFERENT about

playing a football game with Army. The teams
are no world-beaters; several" better teams
come down the pike almost every year. But there ’s
_something about an Army team that makes it look
good——even in defeat. Maybe it ’s the spirit. May-
be it’s beca.use they play hard, clean football all
the way. Panther gridders will tell you that the
Army games are the toughest they have played.
‘Tomorrow’s game will likely be just as tough as
the others. The fact that “Jock” Sutherland’s
teams have risen squarely to the occasion in both
previous meetings of the two teams can vouchsafe
a prediction that this year’s team will put every

:. bit of its_.ability and power into that game.

The University Band can be depended upon for
a great marching and spelling show tomorrow as
well as any other day. That much is certain.

All that is necessary to make it a satisfactory
day all around is a good cheering demonstration
from the student sections. A pep meeting this
morning is designed to encourage that-good cheer-
ing. Perhaps it is obvious that the University can-
not whip up a contingent in one day, nor in one
week, which is capable of out-shouting and out-
singing the Cadets. The point remains that a well-
attended pep assembly today and hearty coopera-
tion from those attending may do more toward
stepping up the volume and unison of those cheers
than one would suppose. A

Players of the team are expected to occupy
places on the stage in Memorial Hall during the
meeting. They will be able to tell if the eheerers
are trying. Let us not have them believe that
those on the stage are the only ones who will be
doing their part as best they can tomorrow after-
noon.

Alumnus, Alumni, Etc.  

MID THE RUSH and bustle of this week-
end’s affairs, there will be running around
the campus any number of more elderly peo-

ple with a collegiate air. These are known as the
Alumni and they are here to take part in'Home-
coming celebrations. Indeed we are glad to have
them.

Many are those who worry and hurry through
four years of school, don a cap and a gown to walk
up for a diploma, and continue more or less mer-
rily on their way without an afterthought for the
school which had a great part in preparing them
for whatever successes they achieve. Fortunately,
there are also those who do not forget, who cherish
a love for their University, and who endow it with
scholarships, or aid needy students over a rocky
road. or are just downright. plain Pitt boosters.
Wh_eii they get that spirit, you can ’t beat them oﬁ
with a. club. And that ’s a good thing. ’

Wlien you notice any of these folks around cam-
pus this week-end, say “Hello” to them. You’ll
know who they are, they ’ll talk Pitt from morning
to night, most of them. They in turn will certainly
appreciate a word of greeting from you. ,

' Try spotting the Alumni, and when you do, give
them both barrels of friendliness. After all, you
maybe an alumnus yourself someday.

She Needed No More Rouge
A professor, previous to a test, saw a coed busily ap-

At the University of California it is possible for a stu-

called upon ,the damages amounts to 25 cents.

What Price Victory?

The women’s government organization at the Montana
State University has decreed that no woman shall use
cosmetics until their team brings home a victory. The
men have been prohibited by their organization to use
the razor and shaving brush during the same period.

They Didn't Know

The dean of women at Ohio State University queried
the women as to what they considered the most desira-
ble qualities that girls should possess. The upperclass
women voted for good morals next to a good family as
being most desirable, but the freshman girls—-they voted
good morals into 14th place.

Chemical Society Will Award
1935 Medal To Dr. Weidlein

Mellon Institute Work Wins
Research Field Honors

For Director ;

 

Dr. Edward R- Weidlein, director of
Mellon Institute, will be presented
with the Chemical Industry Medal for
1935 at the Chemists’ Club, New York
City, tonight.

This award is made annually by
the American Section of the Society
of Chemical Industry for outstanding
accomplishments in the chemical re-
search ﬁeld, and this year for the re-
search accomplishments of Mellon
Institute.

In accepting the medal, Dr. Weid-
lein will tell about some of the scien-
tiﬁc investigations carried on at the
Institute that were accorded recogni-
tion in the award of the medal. His
address will be “Various Results of
Being Resourceful.”

Mellon Institute is an industrial ex-
periment station, a training school for
industrial scientists, a center for re-
search in pure as well as applied
chemistry, and a clearinghouse on
speciﬁc scientiﬁc information for the
public. Its services are seen in the
numerous discoveries, the successful
processes and products, achieved un-
der its auspices, and in the regiment
of keen research men who have there
acquired specialized knowledge and
experience that they are now apply-
ing usefully in other ﬁelds.

The Institute has shown about 3,600
American companies, either as indi-
viduals or as members of industrial
associations, that scientiﬁc research,
properly carried out, is proﬁtable to

_them. Most of the problems accepted

for study, 1911-1935, have been solved
satisfactorily. The Institute has also
been active in stimulating research in
other laboratories and in collaborating
with other research establishments,
both in the United States and abroad.
It is best known, however, by the
commercial processes that it has
evolved (582 U. S. patents) and by
its additions to the literature of chem-
istry and allied sciences (18 books, 122
bulletins, and 1727 papers). During
the past 24 years the Institute has re-
ceived over $10,000,000 from indus-
trialfellowship donors to defray the
cost of scientiﬁc investigations con-
ducted for these companies and asso-
ciations.

Dr. Weidlein tonight will describe
ten new industries that have come
from researches at Mellon Institute.
He will mention the institution’s
notable investigations on processing,
on developing new products, on ad-
vancing industrial operations, on ﬁnd-
ing new uses for old industrial
products, on standardization, on sub-
jects for the beneﬁt of the public
(such as air pollution, tooth decay,
-‘sleep, and cooking utensils), and on
important chemical problems of
strictly scientiﬁc interest, especially
researches in the ﬁeld of the cinchona
alkaloids with the aim of discovering

compounds possessing medical utility.

Engineers Hear

More  Dance

One of the most emphasized, if
not the predominating issues in yes-
terday's engineering seminars, was
the Engineering dance which is to
take place next Friday. The poor
engineers have had dance, dance.
dance hammered into them until
Baron Elliott spells Engineering
dance at the Grotto November 15,
from 9 to 1 o'clock.

Even_ if Baron Elliott doesn't
spell dance, Edward Shepherd,
IE38, chairman for the affair, says,
“E1liott’s band is sure to cast a
spell over the engineers. We have
much conﬁdence that the affair will
be a great success.”

Contrary to all former state-
ments, the programs will be dark
blue in color. This momentous
decision was ﬁnally reached after a
lengthy discussion in Wednesday’s
meeting of the Engineering Associa-

' tion cabinet.

Pitt Riflers Begin Period
01' Preliminary Practice

Puucturing the targets last Monday
for the ﬁrst time this year, Pitt rifle
candidates have already started prac-
tice for the sharpshooting season
which opens January 16.

Practice sessions. are held every
weekday except Saturday, beginning
at 1 o'clock and extending through
the entire afternoon. Five new riﬂes,
30,000 rounds of ammunition, and sev-
eral veterans from last year’s team
give promise for a successful season.

Journalist Dance
To End Conclave

Plan Affair For Next Saturday
Honoring Publications Folk

According to The Pitt News there's
a newspaper convention going on here
next week, with the Governor and nu-
merous other personages scheduled to
make speeches.

The press releases have also an-
nounced that there might be about
130 young men aiid women—thc
ﬂower of undergraduate journalistic
talent of the east—here as delegates.

But that’s where we all come in. In
conjunction with the convention will
be a “stupendous” dance at the Hotel
Schenley ballroom Saturday night of
next week, according to Charles B.
Holstein, C36, dance chairman.

Officially titled the “INA—Publica-
tions Dance,” it will be half in honor
of the visiting delegates and half in
honor of the publications slaves
around here.

“One buck,” asserts Holstein, an
English major, “gets ya in. Just a
buck.”

The dollar dance idea, though not
too new around here, is, says the
chairman, a pretty good one anyhow.

Members of the staffs of The Pitt
News, The Pitt Panther, The Owl,
The Journeyman. Nitt Pews, ROTC
Bugle, Pitt Players, those who tried
out for the staffs and couldn’t make
them, even those who’ve thought
about trying out, and their brothers,
friends, and fraternity colleagues will
be admitted with no questions asked.
But the dollar, says Holstein, is im-
portant.

A last minute flash burns over the
wires advising that Val Garvin and
his Coral Cove orchestra has been
signed for the affair. *

Business Manager Harry E. Rob-
inson, C36, predicts that tickets will
be ﬂoating about campus beginning at
10 o'clock today.

Garvin and his ten cohorts are no
campus strangers, having supplied
the musicalbackground for numerous
dances here.

‘We Can’t Disarm
With Safety Yet,’
Asserts Kleinman

Inquiry To1d—,—‘_ ‘Efforts For Peace
Misdirected At Instruments
Rather Than At Cause”

 

 

“The day has not yet arrived when
we may disarm with safety. You
have to correct the human being,
make him incapable of selﬁshness and
injustice ﬁrst.”

That is the reason why disarmament
conferences cannot succeed at the
present time, according to Captain
Edward A. Kleinman, assistant pro-
fessor of military science_ and tactics,
who spoke before Inqui1jY'Fo'rum Wed-
nesday on “The Dangers of Unprepar-
edness.” ‘ ‘

“Efforts for peace are misdirected
in that they aim at the instruments
rather than at the cause.” he explain-
ed. “Arms are a barometer of an un-
healthy condition——ill will. Remove
ill will and you can have disarma-
ment.”  ‘

He illustrated this pointby refer-
ring to the fact that there are no
fortiﬁcations on the American-Cana-
dian border because there is no hatred
or jealousy between the two countries.
On the other hand, the Franco-German
border is strongly fortiﬁed as a result
of the bad feeling prevailing in both
France and Germany,

“The Versailles Treaty has only
succeeded in breeding new hatred in
spite of its well-meaning attempts to
do the opposite by establishing the
rights of racial and political minori-
ties. On one side are the countries
who beneﬁted and are satisﬁed——the
United States, France, and England.
Opposed to them are -Germany, Italy,
and Japan who feel that they have
been wronged by the treaty," the
speaker said.

-In view of these animosities, Cap-
tain Kleinman m_aintained, it would
be foolish to disarm. “Disarmament
can only come as the result of good
will.” he added.

“Then, unless the human being is
changed, peace is impossible?” came a
question from the ﬂoor.

‘‘I think so,” he answered. “Real
peace is impossible without good will
between countries.”

Another question advanced the pro-
position that, since economic condi-
tions are mainly responsible for wars,
we should ﬁght (verbally) against that
sys‘em which brings on wars.

“But, in that case, how do you know
that you will not create a condition
just as bad?” the speaker countered.
“Systems may be perfect in theory
and unworkable in fact.”

“But many economists claim that
there is a society in which competi-
tion a.nd its resulting bad eﬁects can
be eliminated.”

“We are still incapable of altruism.
There does not yet seem to be a prac-
tical solution.” '
"To‘the question “Do you think that
if Italy had a socialistic government
it would not go abroad for markets?”
Captain Kleinman replied that he was
not certain: “It seems to me that if
a country needs a thing, it will go out
a.nd get it.”

He deﬁned preparedness as “being
in a position to defend what you think
are your rights if attacked?”

“Aren’t demands of militarists for
the largest army and navy in the
world more for attack than for de-
fense?” a student questioned.

“Sometime it is better to beat the
other man to it,” he replied.” “Also,
the War Department is called upon
to perform functions which would be
impossible without larger appropria-
tioiis. A great deal of this money is
spent for the improvement of public
rivers and harbors which are under
the jurisdiction of army engineers.”

Captain Kleinman concluded with
the theory that the United States
would not have been drawn into the
last war if it had been sufficiently pre-
pared. .

“The German military command,"
he contended, “calculated that we
were not sufficiently armed to be of
any use to the Allies, and so they con-
tinued their unrestricted submarine
warfare.”

Munitions Investigator
Will Speak At Forum

On Monday evening, at 8 o’clock, in
the Sclieiiley .Higli School, the Pitts-
l>iirg1i Comnninity Forum will present
Miss Dorothy Detzer, executive secre-
tary of the VVomeii’s International
League for Peace and Social Freedom.

Miss Detzer, who will speak on
“Why a I/Vorld VVaiiting Peace ls
Threatened by VVar_.” was‘ a worker
with the Senate Muiiitio1i_s_Investiga-
tion Committee last year, and recent-
ly returned from a tour around the
world.

According to Rev. Bernard C. Clau-
sen, pastor of the First Baptist
Church and chairman of the Forum,
“It is particularly signiﬁcant that we
present such a program on Armistice
night. While celebratiiig the cu1mina.-
tion of the last war, it is important
that we take pains to prevent another
war, in view of the existing situation
in other parts of the world.”

back to headquarters with another
headache.

Against Coach Gar Davidson's vet-
eran aggregation, Coach Sutherland
will send the same team that started
the Ram contest, except for the left
tackle post where Averell Daniell will
-be used in place of Tony Matisi.

For the-Arniy, Coach Gar DaVidS0Il
will start a. lineup made up of seven
fourth-year men and four l11I1i01‘S- 111

I the front line. Captain Bill Shuler and

Woodie Stromberg will hold down the
terminal posts. Both men are letter-
men and weigh over the 180-pound
mark, For replacements, Russ Jan-
zan and Maurice Preston ﬁll the bill.

At tackles Erik Eriksen and Hal
VVolt‘ will get the assignment, and
Stan Smith‘ and Conrad Necrason will
ﬁll the guard positions. Either T0111
Clifford or Clint Vincent will get the
call at center. All of these men with
the exception of VVolf are letter win-
ners.

The backﬁeld will have three vet-
erans and Monk Meyer in the starting
foursome. Grohs at quarter, Grove at
right half, and Goldenberg at full form
the veteran trio. If Goldenberg does
not start, Coach ,Davidson will use
Clinton True at the line-plunging post.

The team will arrive in Pittsburgh
this morning and stay at Shadyslde
Academy. The soldiers will pI‘0bablY
hold a short limbering-up drill this
afternoon at the S‘adium.

Olsonmen Defend
AMA Team Title

Six rm reams Make New Entry
Record For Meet On M01151?-Y —

 

No less than six teams representing
the University of Pittsburgh will line
up Monday at 1 o’clock on the Schen-
ley Park course for the annual Jun-
ior AMA' cross—countrY Champions-
hips. The varsity squad, composed of
Tost, Leggin, Cook, Theriault, Great,
and Emens, defends the team title for
the third straight year.

Head Coach Carl Olson, plans to
enter a record number of 50 harriers
from his freshman and varsity
squads.

Captaining Panther teams in this
titular contest are: Harold Tost, var-
sity; Andrew Loncher, Junior-va1~
sity; Jack Pfaff, “C” team; John
Vvoodruff, freshmen; H. K. Gust,
freshman “B” team; and John Dona-
deo, freshman “C” team.

Members of the Jayvee club under
Loncher include Robert Follette, Eu-
gene Powers, Harold Connelly, John
Walmsley, and L. J. Ciletti.

James Filson, Frank Bonaroti, Fred
Tredennick, Robert -Cogswell, and Al-
bert Zamborsky, in addition to VVood-
ruff, represent a crack frosh team
that should give their varsity mates
plenty of trouble.

The “C” team shows possibilities in
Pf-aft‘, R. G. Nordstrom, Elliott lVlo11-
troll, William Northrup, Jack Steffen-
ino, James Van Kennen, and Gordon
Rauck

On the yearling “B” aggregation,
Don Bright, George Talipski, Harry
Vvein, A. P. Murray, and Julius Chep-
ko follow Gust’s leadership.

For the Frosh “C” outﬁt, Roland
Martino, Wilson Pizzi, William Ham-
ilton, Joseph Jeznis, Ted Fall, and
Silvio Di Blesio are entered along
with Donadeo.

With entries pouring in to the coun-
ty amateur athletic committee spon-
soring the run, Olson expects plenty
of competition for the team and in-
dividual titles.

about Armistice Day for 26 freshman
football players, who will board the
bus for Connellsville that morning
to play their annual game with the
\Vest Virginia frosh.

Coach,M_il1igan is hoping to keep
the team in its winning stride for
the Little Mountaineer clash Monday.

The change of Cambal to the full
back post and Chickerneo to the sig-
nal-calling position seemed to have
been effective in the State game, and
the shift will likely be permanent.

Lezousky and Asovitch are battling
for the right tackle post.

For the ﬁrst time this season, the
Panther freshmen will be pre-game
favorites. The team departs for Con-
nellsville at 10 o’clock Monday morn
ing, and will return immediately fol-
lowing the game. '

Soldiers Muster
Weapons For Pitt

“Army Likes To Play Panthers,”
Says Pointer Sports Scribe

By Bud Underwood

Pointer Football Writer
Special To_The Pitt News

West Point, Nov. '7-—As usual, the
Cadet football players are always
glad to have a chance to pit their
brand of football against a team as
outstanding as Pitt promises to have
on the ﬁeld tomorrow. And also as
usual, the Army footballers will play
with all the enthusiasm and ﬁght that
an Army team can muster.

But tomorrow’s game will be more
than “just another game to them.”
After defeating a weak Harvard
eleven and triumphing over a tired
Yale team, the hopes were a little
high, only- to be shattered by a defeat
last Saturday at the hands of a fair
Southern team, who showed the
Cadets some hard football lessons.

That the Army team will be able to
reap full beneﬁt from the lessons of
last week is doubtful, too, because lit-
tle “VV11itey” Grove, a dependable cog
in the Army machine, was injured in
a hard mid-week scrimmage. Whether
he will play tomorrow or not is doubt-
ful. ' ‘

Captain William Shuler and other
seniors on the squad remember the
power of a Pitt eleven which defeated
Army a.t VVest Point, 18-13, in 1932
when they were Plebes.

Carlson Risks Good Name,
Picks All-Star Novice Five

Basketball Honors Given To 22 Participants By Coach
Who Wishes He Could Have Chosen Them All

 

A tournament of any kind doesn’t
seem to be quite complete after the
actual playing is over until someone
a.dds the little touch of an all—star se-
lection. This time it’s the novice
basketball tourney, which ended last
Friday after a successful weel:’s run
at the Stadium _under the direction of
Dr. Carlson, and with a supporting
cast of more than 100 of the Uni-
versity’s basketball novices.

Out of this cast Dr. Carlson has
taken everything in his own hands,
assumed all responsibility, and even
risked his own good name to step out
with his idea of which players.should
be given the post-mortem leads in
his production. A

The ﬁrst ﬁve players commonly
titled the ‘ﬁrst scream, or rather, the
first team, were easy picking for the
doctor. All he had to do was to pick
the best ﬁve out of a hundred who
took part in the tourney.

At forwards on this selection are
Rivlin and Lindsey, a pair of stars
which shone through the week. Riv-
lin, one of the cleverest novices in the
tourney-, clinched his selection by his
general all-around ability and clever-
ness in handling the ball. Lindsey
practically showed himself on the all-

tourney by his playing in the ﬁnal
game of the week. With two seconds
to play and his team behind, 33-32,
Lindsey dropped in two fouls to win
the game.

Fable took almost undisputed
possession of a ﬁrst team center posi-
tion by scoring 14 points ineach of
two games and adding ten more in an-
other. At the guards on the ﬁrst
team are Bradley and De Corso. The
former showed as his credentials a
point total of 17 in the ﬁnal game and
great ball-handling. De Corso earn-
ed his place through his passing and
general all-around worth to his team.

Dr. Carlson found the second team
slightly easier to name. Scocchera
and Jack Scott, the red-headed ﬂash,
are at forwards, having shown con-
sistent playing ability during the
week. Tall, gangling Swiner was
named at center, with Morrison and
Sheiding placed at the guards. Sheid-
ing took the individual scoring crown
with his 20 points in one game,

In naming these two all-tourney
teams, Dr. Carlson offered no alibis,
excuses or general remarks. He did,
however, add with one of his impish
grins, “Everyone was good; I wish
we were starting all over again.”

‘Lecturer Describes College

Of Simple Life’

“Propaganda should not be barred
from colleges and universities, but
rather studied and evaluated,” Mrs.
Grace Loucks Elliot, psychologist and
lecturer on college problems, said
Tuesday before a seminar of new
YVVCA committee chairmen.

Mrs. Elliot sees college as an inter-
lude of simpliﬁed life during which
the student should be prepared to
meet the problems of our civilization
open mindedly, but with experience.

Many problems, such as loyalty to
family and to one’s self, cannot be
solved with an ‘either or’ answer,”
Mrs. Elliot believes. “Balance is one
of the essentials that college should

-‘ OU have made great progress in the past 10 years.
Let’s see some of-the things the Bell System has been

doing in that time.

Since 1925, we’ve cut the average time for complet-
ing Long Distance connections from 7% to 1% minutes.
We’ve made the service more immune to weather-— 94% of

our wires are now in cable. We’vc
increased the telep11one’s scope
about 80%——you can now reach
nearly 31,000,000 telephones, in

every -quarter of the globe.

The next 10 year period may
bring equally important advances.
That is one of the ever-present

thrills in telephone work!
