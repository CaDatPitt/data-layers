Scarehouse

‘Sabrina Romano
Staﬂ Wrz'ter .

One type of virus that has popped up recently  I -'

holds victims’ ﬁles for ransom.

“Once a person gets this Virus, it encrypts
ﬁles on their‘ computer. The only way to get
the ﬁles back is to pay [the people behind the
virus] $300,”]effRhoades, who works for-Pitt’s
information technology services, said.

This virus, called CryptoLocker, is just one
way criminals target Internet users.

How students can protect themselves from
cyber crime and other hazards of the digital-
age was the subject of Pitt’s ﬁrst Cyber Secu-
rity Scarehouse, which combined Halloween-
themed decorwith lessons about how students
can protect themselves online. ‘

Pitt’s Computer Services and Systems De-

’ velopment sponsored the event in honor of

National Cyber Security Awareness month.

From 10 am. to 4 p.m., black curtains sec-

tioned off the Assembly Room of the William
Pitt Union into a maze.

The students who walked through the maze
ﬁlled out questionnaires, stopping at various
booths. Students could ﬁnd the answers by
talking to CSSD employees who operated the
booths or by reading informative posters. I

STUDENT GOVERNMENT ‘T

  Website links students buying, selling used books

‘Danielle Fox
Staff _ Wrz'ter

Studentswillno longer need to haggle with the
employees ofbookbuy—back carts or attemptto
purchase and sellbooks through social media.

UsingTextbook Friend, an online platform
where students can buy and sell textbooks
to other students at their campus, students
can.browse for books on a platform for only
Pitt students that organizes books by schools,
majors and course numbers. _

The website’s services became available to
Pitt students about a week ago.-The Student
Government Board voted Tuesday to support

Textbook Friend during the public meeting,
which about 40 students attended, at Nordy’s
Place in the William Pitt Union.

Board member Sarahwinston and Nuwan
Perera, chair of SGB’s Academics Affair Com-
mittee, started working with Karan Parekh
and Joshua Haghani, the site’s co—founders,
about three weeks ago to establish an individual
platform on the website for Pitt students. The
website charges no fee for service and serves
about 2,500 students at 39 universities na-
tionwide.

Parekh and Haghani, who are now sopho-
mores at the University ofPennsy1vania, found-
ed Textbook Friend last October. Parekh said

they wanted to develop a system that would
empower students rather than big business.

“There are large players like Amazon, Ebay
and Chegg, where students can ﬁnd cheaper
textbooks, but [the companies] also take avery
big part of the sale,” Parekh said.

Last SGB election season, Winston cam-
paigned to establish a textbook exchange for
Pitt students. She and Perera began working

‘withDeborah Fyock, manager of the University
Store on Fifth Avenue, injanuary to come up

- ' with a plan for the exchange.

Fyock three or four times last semester, but
have not met again since April.

According to Winston, Fyock did not give
her a deﬁnitive answer about the proposal
for a textbook swap. She added that she and
Perera have not been able to meet with Fyock

' this semester.

“I’m still going to workwith Deborah, butl
thinkthis is a good starting point to show her
how students really are interested,” Winston
said. ’

Fyock said in an email that she was happy
to workwith Winston and Perera to ﬁnd away
to reduce textbook costs.

She said that, at the time, the University
was working to develop an online textbook
price comparison program, but she could only
hintto Winston and Perera aboutthe program
because it was not released until August.

Students can use the programto compare
the prices ofbooks at the University Store with
prices from online textbook distributors, ac-
cording to Fyock’s statement.

If a studentbuys abook fromacompetitor’s
site through the program, she said, the book-
store makes no money on the sale. Fyock said
the University store intended the comparison
program to operate as part of a“one-stopshop-
ping experience” for students.

“Students are encouragedtouse the swap if
theywant, asyetanother meanstobuyboo ,”
Fyock said.

Fyock did not answer additional questions
through email askingthe number of textbooks
soldbythe University’s bookstore and the Uni-
versity’s total proﬁt from book sales.

On the Textbook Friend website, students
can select their university, academic school and
major. Then, they canbegin browsinganarray
oftextbooks. Ifthey ﬁnd a book they want to
purchase, they can contact the seller and ar-
range a time and place to meet on campus to

complete the transaction.

Students looking to sell abook can list de-
tails including the title, edition, author, subject,
course name and number and, ﬁnally, price.

. COLUMN

Depression deserves a voice,
especially on college campuses

Nick Voutsinos
Columniszf

With national depression awareness
month comingto aclose, Ithinkit’s
important for us to acknowledge
the Talk About It campaign, Pitt’s
refreshingly honest response to
such a growing and misunderstood
dilemma.

There is value in recognizing our
University’s efforts to combat de-
pression ﬁrstly because of the con-
siderable threat the disease poses,
especially for college students. In
fact, according to research con-
ducted by Northwestern University
School ofMedicine, one out of every
four or ﬁve students who visits a
university health centerforatypical
cold or sore throat are susceptible
to.be diagnosed with some form of
depression, unbeknownst to the
student. _

The problem here is twofold.
First of all, depression is a slow, in-
sidious disease. It’s not as if you wake

-up one morning completely aware
that you are in a totally different
mental state from the day before.

Rather, depression is an affliction
that both emotionally and physically
drains the victim over an extended

period oftime,asthe symptomscanp.

include chronic fatigue and loss of
interest in activities and relation-
ships. The sluggish development
of depression consequently causes
students to think they are just in a
funk, so they might not feel that it
is necessary to seek help.

The second factor affecting
this growing problem within uni-

. .versities is external. Historically,

many universities have separated
mental health treatment from pri-
mary care, so students were never
routinely screened for depression
when visiting the health center, as it
was not viewed as essential. Depres-
sion screening is incredibly easy to
do because it requires students to
answer simple questions that they
could answer while sitting in the
waiting room.

Many college campuses, how-
ever, neglect to bring adequate

awareness to the dangers of depres— '

sion, the causes behind it, the signs

indicative of it and the ways to help
someone suffering from it. Proper
education on the disease is essential
for college students because college
is often the ﬁrst time in students’
lives when they are truly on their
own. As a result, many students are
uncomfortable talking about their
depression or seeking help in this
unfamiliar setting because they are
eitherunaware ofthe characteristics
of the disease or do not know where
to turn if they have it.
 .1ThiS.i§1.I3d¢¢€l3PF9b1€f!1b€°3“S€
according to research conducted by
psychiatrists atjohn Hopkins Uni-
versity, one of the most powerful
factors that contributes to depres-
sion among college students is a lack
of social support. In other words, if
a student feels that he has no one to
talkto about his emotional troubles
or that his depression is abnormal,
makinghim consequently ashamed
to bring it up to friends, his depres-
sion will almost certainly worsen.
Hence, in order to combat depres-

sion, it is essential that depressed students are
willing to and feel comfortable with express-
ing their feelings and seeking help. And for
this to happen, students must be educated
on depression, and they must be aware of
treatment options.

Therefore, it is important for campuses to
create an environment in which the issue of
depression does not go unspoken. In fact,‘ it
should be an open dialogue. And this brings

which has accomplished just that.
Students and staff members from the Of-
ﬁce of Student Affairs run the campaign, and

- their main goal and slogan is to “give depres-

sion avoice.” Through doing so, the campaign
aims to eliminate the traditional stigma as-
sociated with depression — that the illness is
something you should keep to yourself— and
instead, works to bring the issue forward.
These laudable efforts characterize depres-
sion as a real concern that students should
not be ashamed to talk about. -

the events they host are essential in not only
making students more aware of their mental
health, but also, in allowing them to feel more
comfortable with it. The result is a student

tliesigns of the affliction.

The campaign’s strategy in increasing de-

pression awareness on campus has been very

effective and highly vocal. ‘This is evident all ~

So we shouldgbe thankful that such an
organization exists» on our campus, unlike
some other schools. Not only has it helped to
- strengthen the mental health of our student
body, but it has also made students aware
thatthe bestway to ﬁght depression is to talk
about it. So once again, Ithink it’s essential we
recognize and thank the Talk About It cam-
paign for, indeed, giving depression a voice.

The Pitt women’s volleyball team looks to snap
a three—game losing streak against Maryland,
as the Panthers are in search for theirﬁrst ACC
win since defeating Boston College on Oct. 18
at Fitzgerald Field House.

“[We’re looking forward] to really win-
ning as many games as we can,” senior Kate
Yeazel said of her expectations forthe second
half of the season after the Boston College
match. “We had a few losses that we maybe
shouldn’t have had.”_

5 Butthe losses continued, and Pitthas gone 
into a tailspin since then. T

The Panthers haveestrffggled to win in
their new conference recently. Pitt started
the season strongly with three consecutive
conference wins, buthas since lost six of seven
games to put them below .500 in the confer—.

ence for the ﬁrst time this season.

The Panthers and the Terrapins appear to ’

be equally pegged on paper. Aside from their
record, the teams have struggled against the

both Pitt and Maryland were against No. 14

dropped the games, 3-2 and 3-1, respectively.

Florida State shines

The ACC did not have a good week by any
stretch of the imagination. ‘

No. 7 Miami and No. 9 Clemson both
struggled to pull away from inferior com-
petition, albeit in wins. No. 14 Virginia Tech
scored 10 points on a terrible Duke defense
and lost. Pitt played decent football before
losing embarrassingly to Navy.

At least the conference’s other 13 schools
cah ride the coattails of No. 3 Florida State’s
national title aspirations. The Seminoles give
the conference something to be proud of — at
least for now.

Here’s this week’s ACC Breakdown:

1. Florida State

With Miami looming Saturday, Florida
State faced a major trap game against North
Carolina State. The Seminoles put up 35 ﬁrst-

21$
quarter points and cruised to a49-17 victory
-over the Wolf Pack.

2. Miami _

For the second-straight week, the Hur-
ricanes needed a late drive to win. Running
back Duke _]ohnson’s 1—yard touchdown in
the fourth put Miami ahead for good, 24-21.
The Hurricanes travel to Tallahassee, Fla.,
this weekend in a possible preview of the
ACC Championship.

3. Clemson

A week after its demoralizing loss to
Florida State, Clemson struggled to pull
away from Maryland. The Tigers had just a
six—point lead heading into the fourth before
pulling away with two quick touchdowns in
the ﬁnal quarter.

4. Virginia Tech

rankings early in the season, they have fallen

The Yellow Jackets’ 35-25 win against

Virginia Tech was their second consecutive’

conference win. Defensively, Georgia Tech
couldn’t stop a Virginia passing attack that
has been below average all season. Thejackets
can’t overlook Pitt, which just faced Navy, a
fellow triple—option-based team.

6. Maryland

Even without their quarterback, star wide
receiver and other offensive players, the Ter-

rapins hung around with Clemson. In a down .

week in the conference, Maryland’s loss was
one of the better performances. If the Terps
get some of their injured players back, they
could earn a bid=in a competitive bowl game.

top team in lackluster week of ACC play

_ 7. Duke
Since allowing 58 points to Pitt on Sept.
21, the Blue Devils are 4-0. With its impressive
win at Virginia Tech, Duke is bowl-eligible
for the second—straight year. The last time
Duke went to back—to-back bowls was. .never.
8. Wake Forest

Like Maryland, Wake Forest is going to 

beneﬁt from staying with a top team. The
Demon Deacons kept up offensively with
the Hurricanes, but late in the game Wake’s

, run defense disappeared, allowing Miami to

steal the game.

9. Pitt .

If Pitt can beat Georgia Tech based on
what it learned from its 24-21 loss to Navy,
the loss to the Midshipmen won’t mean much.
That’s a big if, since the loss removed a signiﬁ-

at Georgia Tech would help greatly.

doesn’t have the talent to score that much.

It’s hard to tell what kind of team the Wolf
Pack is after a loss to Florida State. While the
Seminoles scored only 49 points, they scored
35 ﬁrst—quarter points and called the dogs
off. We can only imagine how bad the game

The Orange have had'two weeks to think
about their 5670 loss to Georgia Tech. Syra-

just three wins, the Orange need to improve
down the stretch if they want to go bowling.

14. Boston College a

Boston College’s loss to North Carolina
was the real proof that the Eagles aren’t a
good team. If it can’t pull off the home upset
ofVirginia Tech this weekend, Boston College
can chalk up this season as a loss. ﬂ
