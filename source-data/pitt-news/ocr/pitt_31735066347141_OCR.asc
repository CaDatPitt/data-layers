The trouble-plagued Homecom-

issued a cancellation order Friday
afternoon.

Last Thursday before, the Stu-

‘Throw The Rascals Out’

BY TOM WASELESKI ’

Jerry Brown, the 38-year_-old
California governor, took to the
stump for Jimmy Carter and U.S.
Senate candidate‘ Bill Green at Pitt
Saturday, saying students should
help “throw the rascals out” on

' election day.

Green and Pittsburgh Mayor Pete
Flaherty also spoke at the 90-minute
“breakfast” sponsored by Pitt’s
College Young Democrats.

Much of Green's remarks center-
ed on the amount of money his
Republican opponent, John Heinz,
has been spending on his campaign.
Green charged Heinz spends
$20,000 a day.

“_I don’t think anyone should
spend that much,” Green said. "1
don’t think that’s the way an
election should be conducted.

“It’s not just‘ the money,” he '

went on, ‘ ‘but what you can do with
it. You can make someone
compassionate who has not been.
Green cited a recent Heinz
television advertisement that show-

ed the Republican in a ﬁeld with’

children.

“That one really gets me,” he
said. “When Nixon needed
someone from Congress to support
the impoundment of education
funds, John Heinz was there. Now I

have to watch him spend'$20,000 a.
day that say he’s been with the
- children of this country.” , ‘

Although Brown made an open-
ing pitch ‘for Carter and Green, most

of his time was spent‘ answering: 
" queisti<;>_n.s~lfrom‘ the. audience‘ ‘I " “-
‘ ‘aw’ in‘ r .' ‘ Ii." 

     

-‘Stir?  

  

and more oil,” Brown said, “and in
order to pay for it, we produce more
and more weapons that we then sell
to the rest of the countries of the
world. It’s crazy. The next
president has to turn that arms race
around, because it’s a 4 serious
problem. And I don’t think Ford 1

' knows that it is."
Brown said he didn't think the ,

country could afford to “recycle
Gerald Ford for another four
years, ” charging the President with
‘-'25 years of rather pedestrian
politics.” I

" ’ Brown said the‘. Conservation and

  

   

‘‘I called them up on the phone
and complained, ’ ’ Brown defended,
“and they raised my grade to a
“B.” '

In response to a question, Brown
told the jammed Kurtzman Room
crowd, “College is expensive; you
can’t sent four kids to a ‘private:

school. Obviously there ought to be 7

a sliding scale for tuition. It makes a
lot of sense.”
When asked about his 11th-hour

entry into the Democratic primaries _ :

last spring, Brown said a lot of
people thought he entered too late
while a lot thought he entered too

early since he was governor for only ‘

a year.
He said he hasn’t decided,

whether to run for a second term as ' I

governor in 1978 and that no one
from the Carter camp has
approached him with an offer for a
cabinet post.

"I don’t want to be in the Carter
cabinet, ’ ’ Brown revealed. ‘ ‘I like it
right where I am. Governor of
California's a good job, you know.”

When cornered on busting up big-
corporations, Brown said, “I don’t
know how you'd break them, or if
you did, what’d happen. You’re
always gonna, have a lot of big‘ V»,
companies, and some might well be
broken’ up. I have not given it .

enough thought on how to do it or ‘  

what it'd come to.” . "‘ «

Still Rough

BY MARK CELENDER

Lack of positions isn't the only
reason medical school applicants
are being left out in the cold. Many

of them just aren't competitive

enough, according to pre-profess-
ional advisor Pat Roberts.

The increase in average Medical
College Admission’s Tes’t (MCAT)

scores over the past two decades is

evidence of the tougher competi-
tion, according to the Medical
School Admissions Requirements
1977-78.

Roberts said MCAT scores are
not the decisive factor in getting
accepted to a medical school.

There are many variables,

THE PPU AND THE N YD

It has come to our attention that some
confusion has developed concerning the
position taken by the Pitt Professional Un-
ion on the case of Prof. Paul Nyden in So-
ciology. Prof. Nyden is a member of the

. PPU and last Spring ﬁled with us a griev-

annce about the way in which his con-
tract was terminated. Our official position
on his grievance was expressed in two
documents—“Resolution on the Nyden
Case.. and “Statement of the Grievance
Submitted by Dr. Paul Nyden”—which
are available on request from our office.
‘We would like to take this opportunity
to explain the position we took in these
documents to the general University
community.

First, it is important to recognize that
without a contractually established rela-
tionship with the University, what a fac-

.ultyunionlikeourscandoincaselike

this is somewhat limited. We have a duty
to defend our members when ‘they show
the union probable cause for a grievance,
but we have no power to formally adjudi-
cate a grievance or to compel binding ar-
bitration. Prof. Nyden has mounted on

7 his own a series of defenseactions and

statements which involve generally the
assumption that his contract was tenn-
inated because of political prejudices
against himself and his work on the part
of some members of his department. Giv-
en our limited powers of investigation in
the matter, the PPU did not and could
not take this position. What we were able
to detemiine was that the grievance Prof.
Nyden placed before us raised serious and
substantial questions about the form and
substance of his termination, questions
that demanded an answer. i
To recommend non-renewal, we felt,
meant that Prof. Nyden had to be found
seriously deﬁcient or incompetent in all
. or-a significant part of his academic du-
ties.1Was this actually the case or where
the standards_being applied to his work

more like those which customarily apply
in a decision to recommend for tenure?
What weight had to be given to state-
ments from many sociologists of national
standing and from others with expertise
in Prof. Nyden’s research area——American
labor movement today—that his work was
not only competent but distinguished and
that the revision of his dissertation prom-
ised to be a definitive study of the United
Mine Workers’ reform movement? What
weight had to be given to the positive
evaluations he received from his students?
Could theoretical and methodological dif-
ferences that are common in all fields and
that are more properly the subject of in-
tellectual debate than objective evalua-
tion of academic performance have been
involved in the criticism that was made of
his work and teaching? Did Prof. Nyden’s
strong advocacy of anti-racist, anti-cor-
porate and anti-militarist views within
and outside his department lead to anta-
' gonisms with some of his colleagues and

others, as he claims? In particular, was‘

the three-person review committee in So-
ciology which made the initial evaluation
_and recommendation a committee which
-" could fairly and dispassionately judge his

performance, given that Prof. Nyden had..-

indicated to his chairperson that one of
its members had shown personal hostil-
ity to‘ him? What exactly were the objec-
tions stated in the now famous “secret re-
port” prepared by this review committee
and how would they stand up under scru-
tiny by labor sociologists and researchers
more closely concerned with the kinds of
problems Prof. Nyden was seeking to deal
with? If there were serious objections to
his work, why weren’t they explained in
detail to Prof. Nyden long before the re-
view in order to give him the chance to
either answer them or revise his work ac-
cordingly? In short, has Sociology pres-
-ented an appropriate and convincing case
to justify their majority decision to tenn-

inate his contract? (The PPU believes in
peer review as the essential basis for deci-
sions about promotion and tenure, but
with the clear provision that such review
must respect due process and a candi-
V! dgte’s civil and academic rights.)
' In choosing to act on behalf of Prof.
Nyden’s grievance, the union did not pre-
A tend to answer these questions—we could
not-—but rather to insist»-that» he had a
right to a fair andcomprehensive hearing
on them. Because they touched on sensi-
tive areas of academic freedom and con-
stititutional rights, we recommended in

our “Resolution” of April, 1976, that the".

Provost institute an extraordinary investi-
gating committee composed of five mem-
bers, two chosen by Prof. Nyden, two by
the Dean of the FAS and the ﬁfth by
these four. This committee would have
been given special powers to subpoena
testimony, evidence and doctunents like
the “secret report,” would have conduct-
ed its hearings openly and have provided
for cross-examination, and would have
made a public report of its findings. Prof.
Nyden indicated he would cooperate with
such a committee. The Administration,
ﬂatly rejected the proposal and the chair-
person of Sociology declined our invita-
tion to discuss the position we had taken.
It is not our place to comment on the val:
idity of their reasons But we did feel that
it was improper, without an adjudication
of this kind, for Prof. Nyden to receive
official notice of termination from the
Dean of FAS. We believe that in cases like
this where there are major questions
about the validity of a recommendation
to terminate a faculty member the bur-
den of proof should not be on the person
who stands to lose his or her job. In view
of the subsequent escalation of the cases
on all sides, we also believe that our’pro-
posal might have offered a basis for a
timely and constructivesolution.

This will certainly not be the last dis-‘

pute this University will see about the
prudence and integrity of peer review

. processes. Its destructive consequences

for all concerned emphasize once again
why the Pitt faculty could benefit from
collective bargaining of the kind other
faculties have instituted. Under a contract

of the kind PPU envisions, the Sociology V

department would have established in
wiffing the precise criteria and procedures
for each stage 7‘ of the faculty hiring, re-
newal, promotion and tenure process.
Such criteria’ and procedures would be re-
viewed by an elected faculty-wide com-
.mittee which would also be responsible
for determining whether they were being
‘applied fairly and properly in individual

cases. Formal ' grievance procedures, in- _

cluding the final step of binding arbitra-
tion of disputes, would also be available.
In short, the Nyden case would have been
settled long ago. -

The case is now before the FAS Ten-

.ure and Promotion, Review Board. The

PPU has expressed in the past serious res-

ervations about the constraints under .
which this Board is forced to operate, ‘

constraints which limit its ability -to ren-
der_ due process to faculty who come be-

fore it. Nevertheless, we supported the

formation of this Board and continue to
see it as a place where at least a beginning
can be made in the adjudication of ‘the
questions involved in the Nyden case. If
the matter must be taken to the courts

for final resolution, we are also prepared

to consider recommending that the Amer-
ican Federation of Teachers provide legal
support for Prof. Nyden.

Underlying the Nyden case, as we see
it, is the question of whether this faculty

wants to continue the present Hobbesian A

state of mutual antagonism decided in the
last analysis by the arbitrary authority of
the Administration or whether it wants to
commit itself to contractually established

‘principles, of sound self-govemment and '

peer review. _

Student Activities OtticeCcmce|s Show

(Continued from Page 

In efforts to keep the New
Riders, the Programming Commit-
tee requested a budget modiﬁca-
tion last Wednesday, which would
have re-allocated $1,500 from the
budget for the spring concert to the
Homecoming Show. The spring
concert is co-sponsored by the
Black Action Society (BAS)..

The Programming Committee
did not consult with their advisor,
Student Activities Director Jack
Brown, or members of BAS before
requesting the funding transfer,
Lurye said..

According to SGB guidelines,
BAS would have equal input in
matters related to the spring

_ concert.

According to Allocations Com-
mittee member David Hesidence,
the Committee approved the
budget modiﬁcation with the full
knowledge the requestdid not have

the required advisor’s signature.

and the budget modiﬁcation did not
have the consent of BAS.

“We approved the budget
modiﬁcation because we saw it as
the only way to save the
Homecoming show,” Hesidence‘
said. “We were under severe time
constraints and we wanted to
expedite the matter."

BAS Programming Chairperson
Joy Wilson said BAS did not
approach the Ofﬁce of Student

Activities over the transfer of funds
without BAS consent. “As a
courtesy, however, BAS should
have been notiﬁed," she said.

“We considered the actions an
extraordinary abuse of the entire
process. We also did not feel there
will be - enough‘ time for the
Programming Committee to put on
a concert of the proper type for
Homecoming.” Student Govern-
ment Board Advisor Nancy Evans
said.

SGB President Barry Weisband
charged that, in canceling the
concert, the Student Activities
Ofﬁce overstepped its bounds. “In
the guidelines, the Vice Chancellor

of Student Affairs has the authority

to overrule any action we take, but
in this case we (the SGB) did not‘
even take an action. They had no
right to make that decision without
consulting with students."

“Wevwould have attempted to
put together another group for the
homecoming show if the Student
Activities had not cancelled our
show," Lurye said.

Weisband said the Programming

Committee and the Student Gov- .

ernment will attempt to put
together a show for Homecoming
weekend. which will not be called
the Homecoming show. He said the
show would include Ian Matthews,
who was originally scheduled for
the Homecoming show, and anoth-
er act.

For Carter 

And Green A

(Continued from Page 1),

In response to a question on jobs, 
Brown said, “There's no big, magic. - 
answer to jobs. The more you lower 

unemployment. the more you
stimulate inﬂation, and
because unemployed people oper-

ate as a reserve labor pool to draw 
down the wage base.‘ . That's‘ the ; -
way the system works. It's not very  J

pleasant. but that's the reality.”

He said one approach to take? on  
unemployment would be to “share ; 
the wor_k” by shortening the wm-1; ‘ .
week for those who already have" ' '

jobs.

( Continued from Page 2)

Q.P.A., -organizational activities,’ '

- admissions interviews, letters‘ of 
recommendation and volunteer or , .
research work an applicant has-

done.

Admissions ofﬁcers also weigh »

grades from different schools

accordingly. “If you’re coming out 

of any ivy league school with an-

impressive Q.P.A., it carries a‘ lot.,of, , -

weight,” Robert said.

Admissions personnel take into 

account the pressures of "a heavy
science load and time consuming

labs, Roberts said. -- . - _

Some courses may seem hard and
irrelevant to a medical career but

they test the, pre-med’s' abi1ity"to“ 
absorb an abundance of information _ '
in a short span of time, according to .
Orin Goldblum, President of Alpha 
Epsilon Delta Pre Medical Honor 

Society.

If a student is rejected by a '

medical school he should try to
improve his qualiﬁcations and
re-apply, Roberts said. “A

Graduate or a Post Baccalaureate I I
program will help to counterbals I

ance low undergraduate grades,’fV
Roberts said. ' ‘.‘If MCAT scores

need boosting, the students should ' 
take a prep course or _
independently and retake» the" 

test‘?!

Roberts said the success rate for _
re-applicants is lower than the _ .
success rate for ﬁrst-time appl1- .-

cants, but some applicants do get
admitted after a second try. ‘

“Few re-applicants get accepted I A

after the second try._ Youltlla)’. 3?‘
well forget it if you apply more than
three times,” Roberts said. ' . :.‘

According to the _American‘_ ‘pi:
Application‘ Service ' _ 

out of the 24,98.7  

individuals ﬁling applications in the ' ‘  
1970-71 ﬁrst year entering classes.’   .
11,348‘(45%) were enrolled. In the 
1976-77 ﬁrst year entering class,~out_ : — . ~
of the 44,000 individuals ﬁlingﬂ 7}-._:
applications, only 15,000 (35%) 

Medical
(AMAS),

were enrolled. —

Students rejected _by a medic.allj.':.jfff.
school in the United States may   
want to apply to a school abroad but , _ 

should contemplate the option_.__
carefully, Roberts said. 3‘ " -

Going to a foreign school may
involve learning a ‘new language r
and culture, burdensome licensing-
problems and traveling expensés .1
and even political conﬂicts, Robert ' ‘ ‘
said. "  r r

The Show Must Go On

A small concert is better than no concert. But there will be no concert
at all thanks to an edict from the Oﬂice of Student Activities.

BY BILL MOORE

On Friday, May 5, Carrie was
driving home from having a few
. drinks with some friends at The
Pub in Monroeville. She decided to
stop at the Marriott Inn in
Greentree, where she met Jack.
, Jack, 25, a salesman, took a liking
to‘ Carrie immediately and bought
her a drink. They talked about the
new band, which-was quite good,
and played pinball, which Carrie
found boring. Afterwards, Jack
offered to drive Carrie to her car,
which was parked in the back
parking lot.

_ That is all Jack and Carrie agree
on. After that, Carrie says, she was
raped twice. According to Jack, she
voluntarily participated in sexua
intercourse. —

The Women's Law Caucus

__ sponsored a mock rape trial last
week in the moot courtroom of the
Pitt Law School, complete with
victim, Aefendent and jury. Two
actors from the Pittsburgh Labora-
tory Theater portrayed Carrie and
Jack, and two female lawyers, one
from the District Attorney’s office,
one from th'e ‘Public Defender’s
Ofﬁce, argued the case.. Common

The following is an interview Pitt
News reporter Tom Waseleski had
with California Governor Jerry
Brown following Brown’s appear-
ance at Pitt Saturday on behalf of
candidates Jimmy Carter and Bill
Green.

Pitt News: Governor Brown, how do
you think history will look on the
Ford presidency?

Brown: I don't know if it'll even look
on it. It’s been rather brief and, if

_ Jimmy Carter wins, it will perhaps

be similar to that of Millard Fillmore
or Franklin Pierce.

.Pitt News: How about apathy on the
jcampus? Ivknow you were heavily
into the movements of the 60s—

Brown: Iseeialot ofinterest. Ithink
there’s a lot of interest here today.
Pitt News: But compared to the
60s——do you lament the passinglof
such an activist decade? _

Brown: No, Ilook into the future. I
let other people lament the past.
Naw, I think things—it’s a normal
cycle, and after people get over it
they cool off-a bit. You know, that’s
not a natural—you can’t keep on a
fever pitch for 20 years. So we’re in

sort of a downturn; but it’ll come
back. -

Pitt News: Governor Brown, do you
think a lot of your success in the
primaries came from image cam-
paigning rather than hitting hard on
the issues—— _

Brown: What does hitting hard on
the issues mean? That “issues” is a
mantra of certain media critics-
Pitt News —presenting programs
and policies. You've been _charged
with not presenting them. ' '
Brown: Programs? As governor of
California I’ve passed a bill on

coastal protection, toughest in the 4

nation. We have a nuclear
regulatory program that’s the
toughest in the nation. We have a
farm labor law that‘ gives farmwork-
ers the right to secret ballot
elections, ﬁrst in the nation. We
abolished the oil depletion allow-
ance. We made a ﬂat pay raise so
that cops and judges and janitors
got the same pay raise. We created

-the CCC to give young people jobs.

We got lots of programs. And I
ﬁnd in these campaigns that no
matter how speciﬁc you are,
journalists have to keep asking you
questions, and, uh, how speciﬁc do
you want to be?

Pitt News: Do you see any
signiﬁcant difference between your
stand on various issues and
Governor Carter's?

Brown: Well, there’re differences,
sure. Differences just in the parts of
the country we come from, and in
our different backgrounds, but
we’.re both Democrats‘, and we’re
both committed to trying to put this

‘ country back to work.

Pitt News: Are your differences
chiefly domestic or do they deal with
foreign policy?

I

Brown: Well, I see that the need to
preserve the environment is critical.
In the long term it’s gonna affect our
jobs, and I think we have to be a lot
more straightforward with the
American people in letting them
know that times are gonna get
tougher. There’s no free lunch, and
it’s gonna be very hard to keep taxes
where they-are.

There’s a burden, whether it’s in
defense or 'in jobs or. schools or in
health, and none of those are very
easy problems and , they're not
cheap.’ Just to stay where we are,
we’re all gonna have to work a lot
more. I

Pitt News: One more question,
Governor. Obviously you’re the
hottest political item to hit college
campuses this year. A lot of
students look up to you. What can

you say to students,»at Pitt who are '

disillusioned about having no
prospects for a job‘? ‘

Brown: I don’t—if you’re
disillusioned you better get a job.
Pitt News: But students do look up
to you.

Brown: Well, I've been talking all
morning. If I were to add to that I
would be redundant. I think the
kids have to ﬁnd their own way.
There’re a lot of opportunities in
this country as compared to other
countries around the world, and you
gotta look for it and try to make it
better.

Every generation has its chal-
lenge.‘ For some
Depression, for others it was Korea,
for others it was Vietnam, and now
maybe ours is a certain malaise and
high unemployment. But there’s

 Mock Trial

Closes With
Hung Jury

{Continued from Page 6)

McGowan (Pitt Law School, ’54)
presided.

“It has often been said,” Jack’s
lawyer, Donna Jo McDanieIs,
began, “that the easiest charge for
a woman to bring is a sex charge,
and the hardest thing to dispute is
that women’s word.”

Prosecuting attorney Anne Beg-
ler called Carrie to the stand. She
described the events leading up to
the moment she claimed Jack held
her by the neck and raped her in his
car. “He asked me where my car
was parked. I said it was out in the
upper lot, which is far away. He
said he was parked near the door
and would give me a ride.”

Then, she said, they want to his
car and got inside. “Then he

I grabbed my arms and ripped the



‘O,

front of my dress and put his arms
around my neck.”

According to Carrie, Jack raped
her, and threatened he would harm
her if she screamed. After that, she
said. “I got dressed, he started the
car and drove me up to my car. He
parked next to it, and he pushed
me down on the seat again, opened
his pants, and raped me a second
time.”

She went home then, showered,
and called a friend. The next week,
she went to the police.

Under cross examination, Mc-
Daniels asked the standard ques-
tion about morals, modes of dress,
and sexual activity, drawing
objections from Begler.

Jack took the stand and told a
similar story, but in his version it
was Carrie who took the initiative.
“Every time she would take a sip of
her drink, she would shoot hereyes
over'the top of her glass at me,” he
said. 4

He offered to drive her to her‘
car, he agreed, but only after she

dropped a generous number of I

hints.

‘Asked if she offered any
resistance to his advances oncegin
his.car, he said, “No, only the token
resistence. ’ ’ .

Contrary to Carrie’s story, Jack
alleged that the two had inter-

course oqly once, voluntarily, in the

back seat of his Catalina.

“Did she at anytime say she did
not want to have intercourse with
you,” Jack’s attorney said. “No.
She was reluctant at first, but no,”
he answered.

When Begler attempted to cross
examine Jack, he was clearly
evasive.

“Is it true you never told her you
were married,” Begler said. “She
never asked me,” Jack answered.

“Why did you and she agree to
have intercourse in your car when
she had an apartment a few miles
away,” Begler asked. “I don't
know, maybe she has ‘nebby’
neighbors," he answered.

In her. closing statement, M9}
Daniels concentrated on the incon-
sistencies in Carrie’s testimony,
and the reasonable doubt that was
present. “Ladies and gentlemen,
she told the jury, “I’ll tellyou the
defendant’s story is a much more
believable story, much more
believable than that he held her
with two hands while he took his
pants off.”

In her summation, Begler said
Jack’s story seemed incredible.
“Remember how Carrie looked
when she was on the stand,” she

said. “Put yourself in the same
situation . ’ ’ 4

Judge McGowan then addressed
the jury, made up of vounteers
from the audience, reminding them
that the defendant need not prove
Carrie submitted, but Carrie must
prove she did not.

The jury then recessed, and
entered deliberations (for a pre-
arranged ﬁve minutes) while the
audience was polled. A small
majority went for “not guilty," and
a primarily female minority voted

“ guilty." The makeshift jury. with
only ﬁve minutesto decide a case
of considerable complexity, was

hung. (Out of curiosity, the judge.

polled the jury. They leaned toward
guilty on one count or rape, and not
guilty on the second.)

No rape case is presented in two
hours, no jury is forced to make a
decision in five minutes, and, as
one law student mentioned after-
wards, rape trials are seldom so
funny.

BY GEORGE FAINES

Saturday night’s jazz concert at
Carnegie Music Hall climaxed Pitt’s
sixth annual jazz seminar and gave
the audience a chance to hear some
of the best jazz talents.

Participating musicians included
Clarke Terry on trumpet, Max
_Roach on drums, Jimmy Heath on
reeds, Toots Thielemans on guitar
and harmonica, Terry Pollard on
piano, Abraham Laboriel on bass
and Pitt’s own Nathan Davis on
reeds.$

The concert opened with a
Charlie “Byrd’ ’ Parker composition
titled “The Hymn.” After. only a
couple of verses, each musician took
a brief solo that emphasized his own
distinct style and "approach. Terry
and Heath cooked up a storn on this
one and captured the spirit of old
“Bird” himself.

“God Bless the Child” slowed
things down a little. The crowd
became extremely reverent as the
musicians created a very relaxed
atmosphere.

Terry took the spotlight on
‘ ‘Mumbles, ” a comical number that
had the entire audience (and the
musicians) roaring. Terry is a real
showman who possesses extraor-
dinary talent on the trumpet. He

combines his skill with clever and
amusing antics, thus giving him a
very potent stage presence. Terry,
along with drummer Roach, was
presented an award for his
outstanding contributions to the
jazz field.

After a brief intermission, Davis
joined the musicians and the second
half of the concert began with “A
Time and a Place.” The Bluesy
selection was performed superbly
and featured some really tasteful
three-part harmony. Laboriel’s
bass playing was second to none
and this 27-year-old lad is deﬁnitely
going places.

If there was one special moment
of this year’s concert, it occurred
when Davis played “I Remember
Bill,” a piece which he wrote in
memory of the late jazz enthusiast,
Bill Powell. The mood of this
number was one of respect.

It seemed that Davis’ playing was
guided by his deep love and
devotion to his lost friend. Davis
should be commended for ,his
performance on Saturday night
because he proved himself to be in
the same class of the famous guests
that joined him.

Anyone who witnessed Roach for
the first time, had to leave the

It was through personal sacrifice

During interviews with the

several instances that cut through
the aura of glamour which
permeated the stage‘ Saturday
night. For example, Clark Terry,

Nathan Davis Jozzes It Up

(Continued from Page 8)
concert overwhelmed. He is one of
the greatest, if not THE greatest,
jazz drummers of all time. Roach’s
drum solo “Tryptich" left absolut-
ely nothing to the imagination. It
covered all phases of percussion
and was highlighted by an explosion
of rhythmic sounds.

The next piece was Toots
Thielemans’ “Bluesette,” an old
jazz favorite. Thielemans is a real
character and was dressed to kill in
his overalls and suspenders.
“Bluesette” is a charming little
tune featuring Thielemans whist-
ling along, note for note, whatever
he plays on guitar. Thielemans’
harmonica playing also should
receive merit because it is unique.

The concert ended with Terry's
arrangement of the “Theme from
Flinstones”...that’s right, the Flin-
stones cartoon show. It was a
free-for—all jam that let the
musicians loosen up and have a
good time. After a rousing
applause, Davis brought the
musicians back for a well received
encore. ,

The only fault of the concert was it
lacked a good sound system. This
really was a shame because one
could hardly hear Pollard’s piano
playing. There should be no excuse
for a university the size of Pitt
failing to supply the necessary
equipment for good acoustics. I

Pitt’s sixth annual jazz seminar last week.

hope that this measure is improved
in all future concerts.

This year's jazz seminar was a
remarkable success and the man
behind it all should be Praised.
Davis worked hard to coordinate
and direct the seminar. He couldn’t
have done better in
talented musicians, each one a
master of his instrument.

Jazz is appealing to a larger and
mo're diverse audience each day. It

Roach said being able to play like

stopped Dorsett from reaching the
end zone—a ﬁtting climax for the
player deemed by many to be the
ﬁnest ever in college football,
period. Dorsett was mobbed by his
teammates, the cheerleaders, the
fans-——just about everyone. A
cannon boomed its approval and
literally thousands of Midshipmen
on hand stood and cheered and
displayed the class of the Navy.

It was an emotional moment-
grown men ﬁghting back tears
brought on by the spectacle and
others just standing quietly, in
disbelief, savoring what they had
just witnessed.

‘‘I _really can’t ﬁnd the words to
tell you how great it really felt,”
Dorsett said to a mob of reporters
after the game. “I was so
emotionally high it was just so
unbelievable. Inever felt so great in
my life.”

‘‘It was a very dramatic-

moment," Majors acknowledged.
“My adjectives are getting too big,
but, l’ll tell you, it was a very
exciting moment. I saw people with
tears in their eyes. It was very
dramatic the way he did it.”

“I did that andended up with a
score—that’s fantastic, that’s un-
believable,” Dorsett said. “I
couldn’t"get off the ground after
that, because the team enjoyed it
just as much as I did and, in all the
excitement, they just came over and
swarmed me. And they were just so

shoulders. It was just an
unbelievable thing.”

In terms of excitement, the game
was over at that point. Dorsett, who
should easily be everyone’s back of
the week, was pulled from the game
and swarmed by photographers,
including ABC-TV for a live
interview, on the sideline.

But there WAS a game played
Saturday, though it came in second
to the expectations of Dorsett
surpassing Grifﬁn’s record. Or
maybe there was not a game—the

exploded offensively and relin-
quished nothing on defense in
raising their record to 7-0 and
further strengthening their grasp
on the nations number-two ranking
in both wire service polls behind
top-ranked Michigan, a 35-0 winner
over Indiana. '

It didn't take Pitt long to get on
the scoreboard, but it took them a
half before they ‘ showed the
domination which they are capable
of displaying especially to a Navy
team being avenged for handing the
Panthers a 17-0 upset at Pitt
Stadium last year.

With 7:04 left in the opening
period, Yewcic, who completed
eight out of 10 passes for 97 yards,
faked a handoff into the line, then
ﬁred a bullet over the middle to
tight end Jim Corbett (two
receptions for 49 yards), whop
zig-zagged a path to the end zone
and an early 7-0 Pitt lead (following
the first of six extra points by
Carson Long).

The Panthers, led .. by Dorsett,
picked up considerable yardage,
mostly on short gains, but several
drives fromthen until the end of the
second quarter ﬁzzled out. Two
drives ended in ﬁeld goal attempts
of 42 and 49 yards by Long, but
both were unsuccessful.

“We really sputtered and
stammered the ﬁrst half offen-
sively, but our defense was so
overpowering against thefn,” Ma-
jors said afterwards. “It took
control until the offense got on track
in the second half. Our defense has

 
   

a Navy punt in the second quarter to set up Pitt’s second touchdown, a

silky ard scamper by Tony Dorsett.

done a great job all season, every
ball game, particularly in the last
three when we needed them.”

Though Pitt was missing on many
tackles due to the scrambling of
Navy quarterbacks Bob Lesczynski
and John Kurowski, the defense
dominated the action, holding the.
Midshipmen to only 38 yards in 20
rushes and only another 27 yards in
the air.

Then it was the defense that set
up Pitt’s second score as end Cecil
Johnson blocked a Navy punt and
middle guard Al Romano recovered
on the Navy six with only 1:17 left in‘
the half.

Seven seconds later, Dorsett took
a Yewcic pitch to the left and eased
into the end zone. Long’s kick made
it 14-0 and that’s the way the half
ended.

The Panthers caught ﬁre in the
third quarter for 10 points, then
exploded for 21, more in the ﬁnal
period to put the already one-sided
game even further out of reach.

After a Lesczynski pass was
intercepted by cornerback LeRoy
Felder at the Navy 29 and the
Panthers -could not bring it in from

V there, they settled for a Long ﬁeld

goal of 40 yards with 10:05
remaining in the third quarter.

After several exchanges of
possession, Pitt started a drive from
its own 26 and needed only two.
plays to put six points on the
scoreboard. After Dorsett picked
up ﬁve yards over left guard, his
running mate fullback Elliott
Walker (eight carries, 92 yards)
gathered the rest. In one 69-yard
scoop, ‘Walker broke though the line
then headed toward the right
sideline and daylight to the end
zone with 3:37 remaining. Long’s
conversion upped the margin to
24-0.

The Middies failed to go
anywhere in their next possession
and were forced to punt,‘ Pitt taking

over at the Navy 47. After four short
gains, Dorsett sneaked up the
middle for 15 yards (surpassing the
1,000-yard mark), then repeated his
effort with a powerful burst of 21
yards to the end zone a play later
and with two Midshipmen hanging
on his back.

Just a minute and a half later,
following a Navy fourth and one
attempt which was stopped by
defensive tackle Randy Holloway,
Dorsett took off on his record
breaking run and for his third TD of
the afternoon, raising the Pitt
embarrasment of Navy to 38-0.

' The Panthers’ ﬁnal tally came

with only 51 seconds remaining in

the game, when Dorsett’s relatively
unknown backup, Thom Sindewald,
bull-dozed 18 yards up the middle
for a touchdown.

GRID NOTES: Dorsett now has
1,072 yards for the season...Willi_e

Cliche Kills Boo ters, 3-0

BY MARK MURPHY I

Did you ever hear the expres-'

sion “the best defense is a good
offense?” You won't have to tell
Leo Bemis or his Pitt soccer team.
They found out the hard " way
Saturday when they dropped a 3-0
decision to Grove City.

“We played some good soccer
but we couldn’t ﬁnish our attacks,”
Bemis said. “We couldn’t hold the
ball and keep up the pressure. We

. passed but we didn't go anywhere.

We didn't keep the pressure on and
soon we .committed turnovers. It
was just a matter of time before
they scored.

‘‘It was pretty even much of the
ﬁrst half," Bemis continued. “But
they got a goal to lead 1-0 at
halftime. The ball just sat in front
of the goal. It should have been
cleared but it wasn’t and it was
poked past the goalie. '

“We could say the ﬁrst two goals
shouldn't have been.
good goal was the third but they all
count. They kept the ball on our
side of the field and capitalized on
our mistakes."

Their only '

The Panthers havebeen plagued
by injuries for most of the year and
this game was no exception.

“We had a lot of fellas playing
with injuries," Bemis said. .“But it
was a clean game and no one was
hurt.
Our conditioning has slipped
because many of the guys couldn’t

work out this week because of .

injuries. That is not why we lost
the game, however."

The hosts broke the game open in
the second half with a pair of goals,
which were more than enough to
withstand any last-minute Pitt
surge. '

‘‘In the second half we played
them pretty even," Bemis said.
“Much of the play was at midﬁeld.
Then they scored a close goal and
the third came easier.

“We couldn’t keep the intensity
on for very long. We would have a
good effort, then someone would
have a turnover. We made
mistakes and they kept coming and
coming. It doesn't matter whether
we should have cleared some of the
balls or not.
enough to score.

I was pleased about that. ~

They were good .

"Grove City doesn't have super
talent just as we don't," the

. Panther coach stated". “They have

good speed and good fundamentals
and that is why they are winning.

They have lost only twice (to
Indiana, Pa. and Edinboro), but
they are better than both of the
teams. They have good balance
and talent. They don't play as
many freshmen or sophomores‘ as
we do. We'll just have to mature.

“We ' have. a weakness in
ﬁnishing and no great scorers to
speak of,"Bemis continued. “Now
towards the end of the season the
defenses get tougher so we will
have to work harder."

The Panthers have, three games
left on their schedule, playing Lock
Haven. West Virginia and Penn
State on the next three Friday
nights. One bright spot is that all
three games are at home.

“We'll be playing on our home
turf and we do better at home,"
Bemis said. “We've had some of
our best efforts here. ‘We'll also
have a week between each game to
heal unless someone gets seriously

hurt.

Pitt’s Hopes Pinta-Sized

After Columbus Campaign

BY DAVE MCDONALD

The light on Pitt's NCAA bid
hopes was dimmed this past
Saturday as the cross-country team
suffered two defeats by the
strengths of Kentucky (23-35) and
Ohio State (25-30)‘ at a six-mile
quadrangular meet in Columbus.

The Panthers did show a ﬂicker of
light in two in'stances——-in a

‘near-shutout victory over weak

Cincinnati (16-47), and in Mel
Boyd's first place ﬁnish, a 31:08
course conquest.

The Panthers’ pack was blown
full of holes, allowing too many
Wildcats and Buckeyes to fill the

gaps. After Boyd's .ﬁrst place ﬁnish -

was Kentucky’s Tom Burridge and
Craig Young, followed by Pitt’s
Nort McDonald in fourth place.

After that it was all Ohio State
and Kentucky until Panther Mark
Studnicki ﬁnished 13th, followed
shortly by«Tom Herrmann (16th)
and Ron Wirick (19th). Filling out
the top seven spots on Pitt’s team
were -Bob Lee in 22nd place and
Terry Wile in 23rd.

The major reason for Pitt's defeat
was the deterioration -1 of a" close
pack, which is the reason for the big
gap in time between ﬁrst-place
Boyd and fifth-place Wirick.
Elapsed time between the two was a
minute and 35 seconds, compared
to less than a minute for first place
ﬁnishers Kentucky and a mere 30
second for Ohio State.

Assistant coach Dan Sullivan put
his finger on Pitt’s problem. “We
deﬁnitely have to bring our pack
together and run with the leaders. I
saw some improvements from the
two prior races, but we have a long
way to go." ._

The Panthers may have a lon
way to go, but they don’t have much
time in which to do it. It’s either do
or die now for Pitt at the Central
Collegiate Championships at Kent
State next Saturday if the Panthers
expect to rekindle their hopes for
the NCAA playoffs.

BY JOHN FINN

While the Panther_ football
team is on the verge of becoming
the greatest in that sport's history.
it's not the only squad making
noise on campus.

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
is in the same position the football
team was just four years ago-—
young, enthusiastic, and constantly
improving.

Saturday. the Pantherettes ﬁn-
ished-_third in a l6—team tourna-
ment at the University of Delaware
which included some of the best
women s volleyball teams in the
East.

During the two-day tournament,
the Pitt Spikers swept through
round-robin competition defeating
American University, 15-8, 15-6;
Queens College, 15-9, 15-4; and the
highly touted tournament host,

Monday, October 25, 1976—THE PITT NEWS—Pa§€ I71 

Spikers Dea fen Foes

Delaware. 15-7 and 15-11, before a
large crowd of Delaware partisans.

Pitt advanced to the quarter-
ﬁnals, defeating Salsbury State.
16-14 and 15-13, before falling
victim to the eventual tournament

champions, Southern Connecticut

‘State University.

Coach Mike Hebert said he
believed Pitt may have been
looking ahead in the semi-final
match and therefore lost, 15-11,
7-15. and 10-15. But Hebert's
young team came back to again
trounce Delaware 15-2. 15-11, for
third place.

“You must never let yourself dip
below a certain level of consisten-
cy," he said, “which may have

been what happened tonus today. I .

think we could have won this
tournament." '

Hebert said he still is pleased

with his young team. “To be 13-2
with such a young team at this
point in the season against such
exceptional competition is really
outstanding," he said.

Pitt's schedule doesn't get much
easier with the likes of Edinboro
and Ohio State. but their perfor-
mance this past weekend may have
cinched a bid to Eastern Regionals.

The young Pitt Spikers haven't
challenged for the number one spot
in the country yet, but with their
steady improvement, the future
looks extremely promising.

With fresh polls showing Jimmy
Carter holding the edge and
endorsements of both candidates
ﬂooding in from newspapers across
the country, President Ford and his
Democratic opponent headed Sun-
day into the last full week of their
campaign for the White House.

Interviewed separately on a
national television show, a top
campaign strategist for each of the
two candidates claimed-—predict-
ably—that his man has the
momentum now and will win.
