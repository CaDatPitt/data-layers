New Rules

A committee of 28 college
presidents, of which Pitt'Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar is a
member, set up to investigate
the problems of intercollegiate
athletics has proposed tougher
academic standards for student
athletes, according to a report

in The Chronicle of Higher
Education.

The proposed standards
include a successful completion
of a mandatory high school cur-
riculum and a minimum
standardized-test score for
entering freshmen who want to
play varsity sports, the article
said. '

The committee was formed
last summer by the American
Council on Education to help
eliminate academic abuses in
college sports. The committee’s
recommendations will go
before the annual National Col-
legiate Athletic Association's
.(NCAA) convention in
January.

The group also considered
barring freshmen from entering
varsity competition’ altogether
in certain “high pressure”
sports, but did not draft propos-
als to that effect.

At future meetings, the com-
mittee plans to discuss college

coaches, financial aid and the
NCAA’s rule-enforcement pro-
cess, the article said.

New Pitt Program
Unites Generations

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

A new program to encourage
relationships between students and
the elderly will be getting under-
way here soon.

Young Volunteers in Action is
beginning as part of Generations
Together, an intergenerational ser-
vice organization located at Pitt.

Young Volunteers, a federally-
funded program, is for youths age
14-22 to “provide service for elders
on a one-to-one individual basis
for elders who are homebound in
the Pittsburgh area,” according to
Heather Newman, director of the
program.

Activities may include students

-and understanding,”

accompanying elders to the doctor,
church, on walks around the
neighborhood and assisting with
simple chores, such as shopping or
writing letters.

The student will volunteer for
two hours a week on an on-going
basis, “so they can develop a mut-
ual trust, communication, growth
Newman
said.

All students are invited to attend
a showing of “Close Harmony," a
musical which won the Academy
Award this year for best documen-
tary, at the Frick Fine Arts building
at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow.

adaptive learning environment,
allowing students to advance to
higher levels in individual subjects
at their own rate according to levels
of aptitude, regardless of age.

The faculty at Falk consists of 18
demonstration teachers, 15 interns
in the MAT program and three
teachers assistants.

, Of the 18 full-time demonstra-
tion teachers, six of whom have
their doctorates and three are earn-
ing them, with the remaining
members having their masters
degrees, except for one person who
is presently earning theirs.

The Masters of Arts in Teaching
(MAT) Program, in Pitt’s Gradu-
ate School of Education, allows
graduate students to earn a gradu-
ate degree in education and Pen-
nsylvania teaching certification by
working at Falk full-time for one
calendar year and attending gradu-
ate classes at night. For those who
have an undergraduate degree in a
field other than teaching, the MAT
program gives valuable and neces-
sary experience in working directly
with children.

Student teachers are seniors in
Pitt’s undergraduate school of edu-
cation who spend 15 weeks, usually
during the Fall or Winter terms,
teaching at Falk as well as other
area schools.

Groups
Organizing

Against
 Reagan

By PEGGY FERRI

Many different strategies have
been initiated in the past to moti-
vate people to go to the polls, but
local labor, community and advo-
cacy groups are trying something
more creative this year.

Pittsburgh will be one of over 30
cities hosting more than a week of
activities (Oct. 22-31) opposing
Reaganomics and those who sup-
port its policies.

It’s going to be both a fun and

serious week,” Larry Evans, unem-
ployed steel worker and editor of
the Mill Hunk Herald, said. The
reason for the week’s activities is
that it makes sense to pull together
a coalition to lay the basis for more
serious considerations of the elec-
tions in 1984, according to Evans.

“It’s to wake people up for the
1982 elections and start them
thinking more seriously about the
presidential election,” Evans said.
“The idea is to find agreement
amongst ourselves on what a polit-
ical platform should be.” He added
that groups must combine demo-
cratically with no one group at the

top.

Anyone wanting to tell President
Reagan something in person will
have the opportunity. Individuals
will have three minutes in front of
a video camera to give a personal
message. The hour-long tape will
be sent to Reagan uncut, according
to Evans.

Long time activist Dick Gregory
will give a speech, to be followed by
a rally against Reaganomics, on
Saturday, Oct. 23 at 2 p.m.

During the week, participants
will also erect a tent city to demon-
strate against the policies of this
administration.

A Reagan-antics carnival is sche-
duled for Sunday, Oct 24, featuring
such games as “Stick It to the Utili-
ties.” Each weekday will feature a
special theme ranging from unem-
ployment to rights, culminating
with a rally at the end of the week.

//

Students cuts will be the theme
on Friday, Oct. 28. The days activi-
ties are organized by Pitt’s Progres-
sive Student Network, which will
also present films.

Sunday will not be a day of rest
for these groups.

A Voodoo Reaganomics Cabaret
is scheduled for this day. Entertain-
ment includes The New Group
Theatre, The Five——a local rock
band, and political skits performed
by members of the Consumer
Party. Poetry readings with an
anti-Reaganomics theme is also
planned, according to Evans.

Evans said the only admission
price all week is a can of food. All
proceeds will benefit the Pitts-
burgh Community Foodbank. All
activities will be held at St. Bene-
dict the Moor Church on Center
and Crawford Avenues above thr
Civic Arena.

Hillman Library The Way Students See It

By MICHAEL ROKNICK
Contrary to popular belief,
life does exist in Hillman
Library. This life may at times
seem inanimate--one might be

. tempted to say lifeless—but it

does have a qualitative aspect
that is rarely seen by most.

As in all forms of life, life at
Hillman begins at the bottom,
in this case, the ground floor.
This floor of the library has
dimensions that appear unus-
ual for most people who walk
through the entrance gates.

The first thing that is noticed
is the sound level. It increases
with movement from top to
bott:='-1, the ground floor is the
loudest. This is probably due to
the fact that the ground floor
houses the card catalog, reserve
materials and government doc-
uments that are used frequently
and often hastily. '

The ground floor is also
noisy because most people
enter the building through this
level; here they have easy access
to the elevators. The elevators
are used almost habitually by

people who are determined‘

never to use stairs while they are
at the university.

There were frequent instan-
ces of people using the elevators
to travel only one floor. Some of
these patrons waited up to 5
minutes before an elevator
arrived. Most felt that it was

better to wait and get a free ride _ y

than to travel by foot via the
stairs. One patronsummed it
up when he said, “I like to
travel first class.”

The first floor features the
community interaction of stu-
dents. It is here that students
meet to discuss matters of life
and love. It has been noted by
some that on occasion, the sub-
ject homework has been
brought up and talked about.
Although this occurs on an
infrequent basis, it has helped
some to achieve a better degree
of understanding of a particu-
lar subject.

These community discus-
sions are localized in the main
sitting area across from the
Buhl Library. The large rectan-
gular and circular wooden
tables offer resting places for
both bodies and books, but it
would seem the discussions of
higher learning are usually
saved for midterms and final
exams. ’

The thought behind this is
that there are few places on
campus where people can meet
to sit down and enjoy conversa-
tion. The first and second floors
fulfill this vital need.

The second floor is merely an
extension of the first; the only
distinction is that the second
floor overlooks the first. This
view makes the second floor
balcony popular. Chairs
located along the side of .the

balcony afford an overlook of
the main chamber of the first
floor. The balcony can, and fre-
quently does, allow interaction
between people of both floors.

People on the second floor
have an advantage over those
on the first. Inhabitants of the
second floor_can see who is
coming and going. People on
the first floor can only see the

upper bodies of the people who
are close to the balcony.

The third floor has the most
interesting characteristic of all
the floors. The only things that
are readily seen are books and
tables.

The books and tables subtly
effect the atmosphere of the
floor. Only the serious students
spend time on this floor since it
offers little interaction among
groups of people.

In talking with the students
who populated the floor, I
found that most didn’t want to
be bothered with an interview
because they wanted to concen-
trate on their studies. One stu-
dent did stop long enough to»
say that the third floor offered
him a place to relax that was
both comforting and quiet.

“I hope they don’t change the
format of the floor because it
would ruin what they already
have here,” he said-

In walking to the fourth floor
(not riding in the elevator), the
silence of the third floor per-
meated the fourth.

Upon reaching the fourth
floor, the most noticeable‘fea—
ture is the periodical room,

located on the far left as one
enters from the stairs. The
room is flanked by tables and
chairs similar to the ones on the
first floor. However,
tables are used in a much
quieter fashion on a more infre-
quent basis than their first floor
counterparts.

The periodical room offers a
quiet but very relaxing place to

discuss the topics of politics
and social problems among
varied magazines and
newspapers.

The room also offers a wide
range of foreign language
newspapers. It is here that peo-
ple of differentlanguages meet
with friends to talk about news
from their homelands.
Although at times the room is
filled with talking people, the
words are spoken in a hushed
manner that allows other peo-
ple to study. v

The other areas of the fourth
floor embody the basic design
of the third, and most of the
people who go there are usually
studying. '

The fourth floor’s main
attraction is that, since it is the
highest "floor, it offers the best
view of Oakland. This makes
the seats near the windows
prime real estate. Studying is
done in the area, and the view
offers a break from the tedium.
This makes the fourth floor the
most sought after in the
Library.

Although it seems unlikely,
Hillman Library does have its
interesting moments. One of
these occured in 1978, when 2:

these ,

former student saw a naked
"man run through the ground
level’s main hall. The student,
who asked to remain unidenti-
fied, said she was sitting near
the hallway and saw the naked
man run, past her. She recalled
it as “the most interesting expe-
rience of my college life.”

Another interesting thing
happened when a student tried

to locate a book that was listed
in the card catalog. However, it
could not be found by the
members of the library's staff.
Finally, after three weeks of
searching, the book was found
and the student was notified.

The student received a note
from the library telling him
that he should go to the first
floor to receive his book. When
the student arrived at the first
floor, he was told that the book
could be found at the informa-
tion desk on the ground floor.

When the student went to the
information desk, he was told
that the book could be found at
the main desk on the ground
floor. So the student then went
to the information desk and at
last found his book. However,
the student was told that he
could not take it out because it
was a reserved book that had to
remain in the library--that is,
unless he got special permis-
S10n to remove it.

The student then asked
where he could obtain this spe-
cial permission and was told_to
go to the information desk on
the ground floor. Upon return-
ing there and explaining his
problem, he was told that he

would have to go to the reserve
desk, located a few feet away.

When he arrived at the
reserve desk, he was told to wait
until the staff official who was
in charge of the desk got there.
After 15 minutes, the official
finally arrived and told the stu-
dent that he could not have the
special permission card that he
desired.

.. _.,\

.1

However, he was told that he
could obtain one by going to
another official’s office. 50 the
student went to the next offi-
C1_3l’5 desk and pleaded with
him for the special permission
Sllp he so eagerly desired..

The student showed the offi-
cial the book, which he had
been carrying throughout the
library, and pointed out to him
that the binding hadn’t yet been
broken, even though the book
was over 10 years old.

“If he didn’t give me the
book, I would have murdered
him,” said the student.

It was at this point that the
official relented and let the stu-
dent borrow the book-—on the
condition that he bring it back
the following day. The student
promised to do so and then
overly thanked the official for
letting him have the book.

It was after the student had
returned to his apartment that
he realized his tragic error. The
book, as it turned out, was writ-
ten entirely in French, of which
the student couldn’t read a
word.

“What could I do?” asked the
student. “Every library has its
day."

Innovative teaching techniques
are commonplace at Falk because it

 

 I

 

is a Campus Laboratory School, a
part of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s School of Education.

According to Dr. Roy J. Creek,
director of Falk School and Cam-
«pus Nursery Center, as a campus
laboratory school, Falk has five
missions: ’

O Primarily provide an excellent
education for the children;

0 Allow for educational research

#35,, _by faculty;

0 Introduce new ideas and inno-
vations in education;

0 Encourage educational dis-
semination through the faculty’s
publishing work;

0 Promote advanced teacher
education.
Faculty research abounds at

Falk. Creek cited over half a dozen
examples of faculty members cur-
rently conducting innovative
research studies.

Dr. Marian L. Vollmer’s project
evaluates the progress made by
individual MAT interns while, at
the same time, it acts as a self-
monitoring tool for the school’s
overall MAT training program.

A pretest is given to measure
teaching competence and, once the
internship -has been completed,
another test is given to measure
interns’ improvements. Areas of
change are pinpointed by Vollmer
once the pre- and post-program test
results are correlated.

Researchers from other depart-
ments of the university are also
welcome at Falk School.

‘Students from Pitt’s Dental

.School frequently conduct dental
education classes and psychiatric
residents have conducted small
scale testings and evaluations as
well.

Dr. Jonas Salk used the Falk
School as an initial testing ground

Innovative teaching
techniques are com-_
monplace at Falk. The
51 year old school
offers the same curric-
ulum as a “normal
school” but in an
environment that
allows students to
advance to higher lev-
els in individual sub-
iects at their own rate.

for his vaccine and Dr. Benjamin
Spock was once a visiting psychia-
trist there.

In July of 1930, Leon Falk, Jr.
and Mrs. Marjorie Falk Levy
donated the money to build Falk
School because both shared an
interest in the promotion of pro-

gressive methods of teaching child-
ren. They also wished to provide
Pitt education majors with a
chance to observe these teacing
methods in a university controlled
environment. ‘
Named in memory of their
mother, the school was completed

in 1931 with the Falk children and
foundation having contributed a
total of $200,000 for the endow-
ment of the school. Over 300 stu-
dents attend the school.

Tuition ranges from $1,645 to
$2,305 per year depending on the
student’s grade level. It is used to

cover immediate operating costs.

“We have a low tuition com-
pared to other similar institutions
because of our university affilia-
tion,” Creek said.

Pitt pays for operation and man-
agement fees and for property
upkeep. ’

The Pitt News, Wednesday October .20, 1982

By M. HALL

Free legal advice is available
to all members of the university
community through the Legal
Awareness Committee, located
on the sixth floor of the Student
Union.

A standing committee of the
Student Government Board, the
Legal Awareness Committee
answers a broad range of legal
questions in the cooperation of
the law firm of Gefsky and Leh— _
man, which is on retainer with
the university.

Any student, faculty or uni-
versity employee who wishes to
use this service will meet first
with a member of the commit-
tee’s volunteer staff. His ques-
tions will be passed along to
David Horvitz, the attorney at
Gefsky and Lehman assigned to
Pitt business. After researching
the case, Horvitz then advises
the committee.

Gefsky and Lehman can be

necessary, at a university dis-
count. Those eligible are
entitled to one half .hour of free
consultation. The remainder of
the time is charged at 75 percent
of the usual fee.

According to Kurt Binkley,
chairman of the Legal Aware-
ness Committee, his staff deals

used for further legal aid if -

Free Advice Available

with all types of legal problems,
but the majority of inquiries
involve tenant-landlord dis-
putes. At the beginning of a
term, the committee staff takes
many calls from students need-
ing to have leases interpreted.
Committee co-chairman
Patty Skirtich said most of their
cases concern “infringement of
rights on campus,” from illegal
searches to withholding of
security deposits by landlords.
The committee acts as a disin-
terested third party to advise the

' client of his legal recourse.

There are currently 15 com-
mittee members, with 20 others
who have begun fulfilling the
requirements to join since the
beginning of the term. Any
undergraduate interested in
joining must put in 10 hours
working in the committee office
and observing staff members
handle cases.

The idea for a free legal advi-
sory service, financed by student
activities fees was first presented
in 1969. The Legal Awareness
Committee was actually formed
in 1971. Since its founding, the
committee has been contacted
by numerous other colleges and
universities, including Johns
Hopkins, interested in using
Pitt’s committee as a model for
their own legal advisory
services.

English Department Brings
Back Coffee House Flavor

Coffee houses through the years
have been the places for aspiring
poets and novelists to meet in an
informal atmosphere, read their
latest works and obtain feedback
from their fellow artists. The old-
time coffee houses have all but dis-
appeared, but the feelings they
evoked are still present at Pitt.

Frankie Gustine’s is a new
“coffee-house”, where writers meet
to present their crafts. Only this
time the aspiring writers are not
Hemingways or McKuens—yet.

These writers are Pitt graduate
and undergraduate students who
enjoy writing, some of whom wish
to make it their life’s work. There
are also Pitt English teachers,
CMU students and people from the
Oakland community who wish to
improve their writing by listening
to others’ advice.

Eve Shelnutt, a Pitt English
teacher, came up with the idea of
having student readings, according
to Bruce Dobler, another Pitt pro-
fessor. Last year, the first it was
done, the readings were held in the
English department. This year,
Gustine’s was suggested as the

The readings have received such
tremendous response from the
community that Dobler said there
is a real fear that Gustine’s back
room won’t be able to hold all the
people who want to listen to the
readings. While Oakland may not
be San Francisco or Greenwich Vil-
lage, Dobler said there is a real
audience for this at Pitt.

A list of the scheduled readers are
available several days before the
actual readings, and there is usu-
ally a mix of different types of read-
ings. On a given night, people can
expect to hear fiction, poetry, and
non-fiction.

While teachers and other profes-
sionals read, Dobler said the read-
ings are mainly for the benefit of
the students.

“Students get a chance to hear
other poets; it gives them a chance
to develop as poets," he said. “It’s
also a good practice room for read-
ing in front of a group; especially
for the graduate students.”

When the readings started,
Dobler said the English depart-
ment was hoping at least 30, people
would attend. Lately, the figure
has doubled.

Speaksto

Fraternities

By GREG PETRO

Pitt basketball coach Dr. Roy
Chipman called on Pitt frater-
nity pledges during a pledge
association dinner Monday

I night to help out the basketball
team this season.

“They will need all the sup-
port they can get. The Big East
is a student support league,”
Chipman said.

During the dinner, which
was held for about 150 frater-
nity members and their new
pledges, Chipman reminisces
about his own experiences
while in a fraternity during
college.

“During my time as an
undergraduate fraternity
member it was a lot of fun.
However, fraternities are not
just for the time that you are an
undergraduate; as an alumni,
you can also stay active and in
touch with what is going on,”
Chipman said.

Randy Bardol, president of
the Inter—fraternity Council,
said the number of students
who pledged fraternities this
fall increased.

UHP Implements New Policies

The new adviser of Pitt’s
University Honors Program
said he sees “misconceptions
surrounding the program."

Barry Applbaum, the adviser
since September, said many stu-
dents think that the classes are
accelerated, too hard and will
result in low grades. Therefore,
students don’t take the classes

The Pitt News, Wednesday October 20, 1982

Although the basic philo-
sophy of the UHP is the same,
there are certain changes that
have been implemented to
allow the program to reach
more students.

For example. students don’t
have to maintain all A's or be
scholars in order to benefit from
the UHP courses. Many times

special might not have been
challenged by the courses they
took. UHP courses, therefore,
offer a challenge.

The program, while seeking
ways to be available to more stu-

The courses are not accelerated

Resisters Have a Friend l

With the reinstatement of the

find themselves objecting to the
fact they have to registar with the
possibility of fighting in an
unknown war. 7

The Central Committee for
Conscientious Objectors (CCCO)
is a service organization that has
helped these young people for 34
years. For example, 13 indictments

Pro-life Group Attempting to Help Mothers

By CAROLE MCCORKLE

A Pitt pro-life group is
attempting to establish a mater-
nity loan fund that would make
money available to unmarried
Pitt women who choose to carry
their pregnancy to full term.

Harry Brock, president of Pitt
Students For Life, said the pro-
posed fund is an attempt to give
women an option besides abor-
tion. The program, modeled
after a similar one at Duke Uni-

versity is in the planning stages,
Brock said.

Pitt Students for Life, com-
prising about 90 members, was
organized three years ago by
Pitt student Jeanne Wallace,
who believed that the pro-life
side of the abortion issue was
being underrepresented.

The group, which meets
twice a month, marched last
year in Washington to protest
legalization of abortion. It has
also promoted events i)o_nsored

by the Michael Fund, a pro-life
genetic research foundation
that sponsors doctors who
experiment for pro-life reasons.
Two Pitt Students for Life,
along with 15 Pitt medical stu-
dents, are also affiliated with a
national group World Federa-
tion of Doctors Who Respect
Life.

“We don’t'view our group as
necessarily conservative,”
Brock said. “Our beliefs can be
viewed as liberal or progressive

in that we are fighting for the
rights of silent victims who can-
not defend themselves."

Pitt Students for Life will be
distributing information about
its pro-life stance during
Human Awareness Week, to be
held November 1-4.

The group is especially inter-
ested in presenting their facts to
pregnant women who may be
contemplating abortion.

“If my leadership would
result in saving one life, then its
worthwhile,”Brock said.

Vicious Cycles

Reform movements work in cycles. Once a certain
amount of change occurs, the problem is again left

‘alone until the need for reform arises again.

Consider the Central .Intelligence Agency.

In the wake of Watergate and public disclosures
about covert CIA activities in Chile and Cuba, legis-
lators and the public demanded that the agency’s
activities be more closely monitored. This led to a
series of reforms, beginning with the 1974 amend-
ments to the Freedom of Information Act, that made
it tougher for the CIA to keep secrets because of
“national security,” an ambiguous term that the
CIA has liberally interpreted. The spotlight on the
agency continued during hearings conducted by
Sen. Frank Church that revealed not only some of
the things that the CIA had been doing, but later,
that CIA directors were not reluctant to lie to
Church's committee about their activities.

Now, however, the -pendulum is swinging the
other way, and this will have an important effect on
colleges and universities. A _

A U.S. Court of Appeals. judge ruled recently that
the CIA can keep its contacts with American colleges
and universities secret. The agency's -operations
could be -hampered if information about its contacts
were revealed, the judge ruled. V _

The case "began when a student at the University of
California at Los Angeles requested information
through the Freedom of Information Act about
“past and present arrangements and relationships”
between the CIA and the campus. B

More than 125 requests under the Freedom of
Information Act have been filed for information
about CIA activities on more than one hundred col-
leges and universities. The fact that Pitt Chancellor
Wesley Posvar was among a number of university
presidents who met with the CIA to discuss recruit-
ing on this campus several years ago was disclosed
using Freedom of Information Act documents.

It would be impossible~to' uncover that again,
according to the judge’s‘:ruling. And the Reagan
administration would like to make it even harder to
use the Freedom of Information Act. Originally, the
administration was pushing to allow the CIA total
exemptionfrom the act.

It seems that now, when tensions are heating up
between the United States and the Soviets and the
public is more aware what an unleashed CIA can do,
it would be more important than ever to keep a close
eye on the agency. But that’s not the way Washing-
ton views things. Time has already run out for those
who are looking to find out what the CIA is doing on
their campuses.

Socrates: Fighting Not To Fight

By STEVE PARKS

After weeks of being unem-
ployed, Socrates has found .a job as
-a janitor at the Pentagon. Broom
and dustpan- in -hand, he strolls
down the hall and enters the gener-
als’ office. At the desk sits General
Nukem, head of Selective Service
Registration. ' ’

“That’s right Ronnie, we got i

that draft.'.er..regis»tration dodger

locked away,” Nukem said, laugh- .

ing. Looking up, he sees Socrates.
“Gotta go Gipper, some nut just

entered my office. Who are you?”
“Socrates, ' ’

came to clean your office.”

“You hippie! It’s your type that’s
ruining this great country.”

“Me?”

“Yes, you and your partying,
good-time friends,” answered
Nukem.

“How do you know that?” ques-
tioned Socrates.

“By the way you dress! Only
degenerates would have hair that
long. I had better never catch you
in this man's army!”

“Don’t worry, I’m one of the
many, the smart, the civilians!”

answered Socrates.

“Did you register?” Nukem—
asked.
“For what?"

“The Selective Service,” he
answered.

“What’s that?” Socrates asked.
“It’s a pool of names that the
government can draw from in case
of war. All 18-year-old males on the
list are called on to fight for their
country.”
“And if they don’t want to
fight?” asked a curious Socrates.
“They don’t have a choice,"
Nukem said. “If they really object,
of course, they might be cooks or

“You’re not going to make him a A

“Who’d want a whiner like that
in the army?” Nukem asked. “No,
just give me good soldiers!”

“What’s a good soldier?”
Socrates asked.

“Someone who loves his country
and its ideals enough to fight over-

“What ideals do you mean?”
Socrates asked.

“Freedom of choice, the right to

stand up for what you believe in!”
Nukem answered, red, white and
blue tears welling in his eyes.

“What’s a bad soldier?”

“A man who bows to pressure, a
man afraid to fight what seem to be
unbeatable opponents. He isn't an
American, he is a coward.”

“Then the dodger was a good
soldier,” Socrates said.

“No way,” the general snapped,
his short hair standing on end.

“But he fought overwhelming
odds for an idea, his freedom of

choice not to fight or be a part of '

the fighting. He stood -up for his
ideas—he is
Socrates explained.
“But...”
Nukem.

“Those who. register do so just
because of what will happen if they
don’t, not for their beliefs. Accord-
ing to you, _these are bad soldiers.
Your draft sends the good soldiers
to jail and the bad, soldiers into the
army," suggested Socrates.

“But some want to fight!”

“Then letthem fight. But should I

“Communist! Get out! Get out!

general, waving his arms wildly.

Afterwards, Nukem decides to
call an old friend.

“Hey Ron, some nut came in
today and gave me a hard time. His
name’s Socrates—long beard,
wears a toga. I think he’s acommu-

“And they say I'm senile,”Ron-

According to Georgine Materniak, coordinator of the
Learning Skills Center, “Most of the handicapped stu-
dent’s skills are identical to the nonhandicapped.”

Encouraging independence
among handicapped students is
an important function of the Dis-
abled Special Student Services,
according to coordinator Tom
Galanti. “From day one, the stu-
dents know the philosophy of
our department. We want them
to be able to stand on their own
two feet. We want them to be
independent enough to handle
similar problems in the outside
world.”

Preparation begins in the
application process, before the
student starts school. Appoint-
ments are made to discuss edu-
cational goals and career
possibilities, and an orientation

program is designed, in addition I

to the one offered by the Office
of New Student Programs. Stu-
dents are guided in educational
pursuits before, during and after
attending the university.

Galanti, who attended the uni-
versity and “loved it here from
the beginning,” has seen Special
Student Services grow from a
small shoe-string budget to what
it is today. The number of stu-
dents has increased from 10 to
at least 150.

“We now have to provide a
better quality service,” he said.
“Still, the recent cutbacks in
financial aid and funds may
prove hazardous to the depart-
ment. If the cutbacks continue,
our situation will get worse.
We’ll definitely lose more
people.”

One of the things the office
does is to monitor accessibility
to facilities and programs.
“Access-—A Guide to the Cam-
pus of the University of Pitts-
burgh” is a brochure designed
and printed by the office that
maps out routes to accessible
buildings and contains informa-
tion on entrances, ramps, curb-
cuts, emergency" telephones and
available parking.

Readers and interpreters are
also provided by the office.
Readers accompany the visually
impaired when course work
requires reading and interpre-
ters accompany those with hear-
ing disabilities and translate
lectures into sign language.
Interpreters are contracted
through the Pittsburgh Hearing
and Speech Society, while work

study students or volunteers
serve as readers.

To help handicapped stu-
dents take exams, proctors are
provided. The exams are taken
either on the scheduled testing
day or close to it. Proctors
should have knowledge of the
subject, so they can translate
maps, charts and graphs.

Galanti feels that proctors
should be rotated. ‘‘If the stu-
dent and his proctor get too
close it can damage the testing
situation. We want our students
to earn their grades like every-
one else,” he said.

Special Services handles a
broad range of students includ-
ing part-time students, commu-
ters, graduates and residents.
Attendants are provided for the
residents, but an organization
hasn’t yet been established for
all of the students to use.

“Our students cope just like
any other- students. Students
from special education schools
have more problems adjusting
than those, from public schools.
One thing we can do is provide
better services if we know a stu-
dent is coming. An organization

would make the university-_

aware of any problems after they
arrive,” said Galanti. ,

The Learning Skills Center is
a free service for all the students
of the university. It has work-
shops on study skills, reading
techniques and comprehension.
Individual counseling is also
offered. Georgine Materniak,
coordinator of the center, said,
“Most of the handicapped stu-
dents’ skills are identical to the
nonhandicapped. It’s all a matter
of teaching the same study skills
in the mode they have to learn
in.” V ,

For instance, a visually

impaired student would have to
work with tape recorded mate-
rials and a student with a hearing
disability would have to work
with an interpreter. The center
provides individual assistance
and the proper resources.
O Hillman Library also offers
resources for the handicapped.
Among the facilities are reading
rooms for the visually impaired
and specially designed tape
recorder systems. The Social
Science Utilization Laboratory
and 18 other campus libraries
are all offered to students.

“Considering the wicked
weather and hills,~this is not an
easy place for anyone to navi-
gate around,” Galanti said. The
City has to work closely with the
university, since the streets
aren’t university owned. “The
city has done q_uit_-3 3 bft to give
befiﬂf accessibility. People in
wheelchairs used to feel like they
were on an island, but that’s all

changed.”
Among the other services for

the handicapped are university .

housing in Tower C, Bruce and
Forbes Halls and various com-
munity services with which Spe-
cial Services works. The Bureau
of Vocational Rehabilitation and
The Office for the Visually Han-
dicapped are two such services.
Both provide vocational advice,
counseling and financial aid.

The athletic department,
located in Trees Hall, provides
special facilities for the students.
A branch of the department,
Adapted Physical Education,
allows for the student to partici-
pate in individualized programs
of activity. Much of this involves
a weight training program
designed for individual needs
and goals.

Warren Sipp, head of the pro-
gram, said he “tries to break,
down the term ‘handicappism.’ If
a student comes in to see me_
and says he has this handicap, I’ll
say, ‘Well that’s fine, but who are
you?’ ”

The program is based on the
relationship Sipp develops with
the student. “I try to challenge
the student while encouraging

 

 

porting their lifetime fitness

interests.

“Initially there was a lot of
antagonism with the handi-
capped working around the non-
handicapped. There was some
uneasiness, but in this day and
age, the students feel pretty
comfortable in the atmosphere,”
he said.

Two of his students work in
the aquatic area, where there is
a chair lift to help the disabled in
and out of the water. Other stu-
dents work on the racquetball
courts, in the fitness lab and on
the track. However, there aren’t
as many students involved in the
program as there could be.

Although the university sup-
plies the student with services of-
a private van from Magic Carpet
Inc., not as many students are
involved as Warren would like.
“It’s really hard to navigate up
the hill to Trees Hall. I tried it
once myself in a wheelchair. The
coming up was bad enough but
the going down was real tricky.”

The services are available,
along with the opportunity to

he said. The planning of these

  Brooks Departs

From Pitt Bench
 And Sparkles

 By IRA M. KATZ

The Pitt Panthers are 5-0 near-
ing the midway point of the season,
which partially reflects the depth
they possess. This was never more
evident ‘than after Pitt's victory
over Temple last Saturday.

A neck injury to one of the pre-
mier defensive ends in the country,
Michael Woods, had left the Panth-
ers with a void to fill. Senior defen-
sive end Michael Brooks, from
Phoenix, Arizona, did more than a
commendable job in replacing
Woods. '

-@ Woods’ injury, suffered in the

West Virginia game, appears to be
more serious than first thought.
Panther team physicians said
Woods will remain out of action
for an indefinite period of time.

,« Brooks stepped in and was the
leading tackler for the Panthers
against Temple. Eight times he
assisted in a tackle and three other

times "he converged on an Owl.

himself.. “
“I just feel good, anytime I can
help the team’ out," Brooks said
-after the game. “It is a great
feeling." . ’ ' ’ ‘
How does‘-Brooks feel about step-

ping in for a proven performer like _
 Woods? “Well, I know I have to be

ready every week and play as hard

as I can,” Brooks said, adding, “I
have to play like I know he would.”
Brooks has packed a few travel-
ing bags during his college football
career. In his freshman year, he
played for the legendary Frank
Kush at Arizona State University.
Kush is now the head coach of the
Baltimore Colts of the National
Football League. '

Kush was noted for rigid disci-
pline and stressing of fundamen-
tals during his 23 years as head
coach at ASU.

“It was a good experience to play
for a guy like Frank Kush who was
such a perfectionist,” Brooks said.

After his freshman year with the
Sun Devils, Brooks transferred to
Scottsdale Community College in
Arizona, where he was a National

-Junior College Athletic Associa-

tion All-America linebacker.

Then, in 1981, Pantherreceiver.
coach Joe Naunchik successfully
recruited Brooks and teammate Art
Lowery from Scottsdale.

Last season, Brooks excelled on
the special teams, thanksto a favor-
able attitude toward thatareaiof
play. V

“I enjoy playing special teams
and,“ most of all, contributing to
the team,” he said.

Athletic , ability is something

Michael Brooks has-never lacked. _. .

Moorehead A

By CHARLIE O’HARA

Bill Moorehead is a mains_tay in
the Pitt running program. He is
outspoken and candid, as well as
talented and hard working.

Moorehead, who transferred
from Wake Forest in the fall of his
sophomore year, is very
optimistic—if not ecstatic—at the
thought of running under recently

jag, hired coach John Vasvary.
"”' “He's not‘ the buddy-buddy type,

but he inspires you a great deal to
work very hard because you know
that he is working equally as hard
for your benefit.”

Moorehead welcomes the chal-
lenge and believes that the team's
hard work is paying off.

‘Utility Runner

“As a team, we are in the best
shape that a Pitt team has been in
since I have been associated with
the program."

At Pitt for a month and a half-
now, Vasvary has Moorehead
believing that the Panther cross
country team will be a national
contender within three years. As for
track, Moorehead says that the
nation will hear about Pitt this
winter. ,

On an individual basis, Moore-
head "considers himself the team’s
utility man.

“Before coming to Pitt," he says.

Wake Forest and even earlier at

Money Rules CoI|egeFootbaill.

By_ MARK A. SINDLER

The day started out ominously,
with forebodings of catastrophe,
and gave no indications of getting
any better. Dismal, overcast skies
and frightening cool temperatures
told me that this was no day for
outside activity.

With that decided, I made my
way to the grandoise offices of The
Pitt News, plopped down in a
chai—r, started reading SPORTS
ILLUSTRA TED and even had the
strength to answer some phone
calls. it .

One of those calls endured for a
half an hour. A Washington, D.C.-
based correspondent on the Lon-
don Daily Standard phoned and
asked me about former head coach
Jackie Sherrill’s leaving for the
sake of megabucks at Texas A8cM.

“ls he kidding?” I thought. Sher-
rill revealed his decision over 10
months ago and the whole episode
had already blown over. But, wait a

minute, I was not going to hang up w

or tell him that time does not stand
still. “No,” I thought,” maybe he
just wants a synopsis of L’Affa1re
Sherrill and be done with.” Itwas a

good thing that I did not hang up. “

The first query led toianother,
and beforel knew what hit me, this

Englishman was totally outraged I

over the importance placed on col-
lege sports in general, and on col-
lege football in particular, in
America.

And, to go one step further, it
was something of an embarrass-
ment that l, as an American repre-
sentative, could not defend the
phenomenal number of green-
backs annually dumped into colle-
giate football.

What the question comes down
to is, do the ends really justify the
means? Seriously consider for a

minute the funds invested in foot-

on the collegiate level,” Brooks
said. “I'd talk with h-im and he
would give me some advice.”

Brooks said that the toughest
aspect of college football is the
mental preparation.

b “We have to-stay together as a
;unit because everybody comes~in.
with" the ideas of upsetting us,” he
said. “It is tough to get up every
week for the ball game.”

ball. There are uniforms, stadiums,
travel and accomodation arrange-
ments, the exorbitant coaching
salaries, publicity costs entailed in
sports information departments.

Now let’s delve into the return ’

the school receives on its immense
investment. Topping the list are
.the network obligations‘ each
school receives from regionally tel-
evised‘ games. That is roughly
$500,000 a shot. Smaller, butjust as
important, are the considerations
of alumni contributions, gate

receipts, returns on bowl packages ‘

and the media hype Dan Marino
receives when appearing on var-
’ious magazine covers....

The picture is clear, but the
whole situation remains a puzzle to
me. I mean, what is the difference,
in the long run, of subtracting the
output dollars from the input
dollars?

The difference had better be pos-

gitive-—a profit_—-or something is

wrong. Division I schools do in
most instances record good returns.

What is defined as “good” is
another story. I seriously doubt
that schools of stature similar to
Pitt’s actually rake in enough
money to mitigate the initial
investment of gaining this profit. .

Well, the Aggies did, those
football-minded Texans. It was the
ambition-of its alumni booster club
that flexed its immense biceps and
demanded a winning coach,
regardless of cost. ‘Go anywhere,
do whatever needs to be done’. It
doesn't matter how far you go, but
we want a winner,’ they might have
said.

With the Brinkstruck waiting at
his front doorstep, Sherrill left Pitt
for the great gold pot on the
horizon. Of course, it is hard to
refuse a six-year package said to be

in the $1.6 million range. That’s a
bigger salary than A8cM’s presti-
dent, Frank Vandiver, pulls in.

What this will all lead to is an
escalating bidding war amongst
the big schools. It may not happen
next year, or even two years from
now, but the day, will come.

Sure, soon there will be people
like John Robinson, Don James,
Lou Holtz and Dick Crum who
will become free-agents in the col-
lege football ranks. Schools will go
to any extent to recruit a winning
coach. In short, the Sherrill case
has set a very dangerous precedent.

True, one can argue that without
football reve.nues, the school
library or proposed lecture hall
wing would not be feasible. But
could it be true that alumni would
give generously for a chemistry
lab? Or why not fund a physicist’s
research project in hopes that he
will win a Nobel Prize, which
could easily bring as much promi-
nence as a winning team?

‘Hey, administrator-s do a pretty

good —job persuading alumni to.

fork over the bucks for a football
program, so the same can be done
for academia. And the chances of
winning a Nobel Prize are the same
of capturing the national
championship.

Sigh, the conversation was
almost complete, and already I was
talking to this stranger about the
contrasting cultures of Great Bri-
tain and America and the values
each culture deems important.

1 did not get the man’s name
amidst this thought-provoking
chat. It was not important. What
was significant, though, was that
our society’s values are surely
gnarled in one instance——we accept
college football in a screwed-up
fashion.

Ahern Brings Talent, Humor To Field Hockey

By TAMMY ANDERSON

What has two legs covered with
awkward pads, a funny looking
helmet, one glove, one stick and a
sense of humor that could make
Ebeneezer Scrooge laugh? The
answer: Colleen Ahern, a senior
goalie and current tri-captain who
brings two distinct gifts to the Lady
Panther field hockey team.

First, Ahern brings her talent. In
each of the eight years that she has
competed in field hockey, Ahern
has been the starting goalie. She
has made All-Star teams in both
high school and college.

At Williamsville North High
School in Buffalo, N.Y;,she was
named to the Erie County All-Star

Once again my notebook is
stuffed with thoughts from the past
and of the future, which must be
released to make room for the trip
to Syracuse: 

0 By the time Notre Dame rolls
into town, Washington will have
lost a game. Pitt will be the No. 1
ranked team on both the AP and
UPI polls.

0 Penn State’s loss to Alabama
was a great help to the Panthers,
not only in recruiting, but also in
the polls. With Pitt and Penn State
ranked second and third, they no

then competed on the
MidEast Selection Team during
her freshman year at Pitt in 1979.

She is the Panthers’ only scholar-
ship player, a further indication of
her ability.

Coach Cindy Baldridge
acknowledges Ahern’s talent.
“Colleen has improved greatly
over the past two seasons. She has
become quicker, more confident
and more dedicated in her play.
Colleen is the kind of good all-
around player that a coach likes to
have on her team.”

Talent, however is not the only
gift Ahern brings to Pitt's field
hockey team. She adds a sense of
humor that perhaps is more valua-
ble than her individual talent or

doubt split the first place votes of
the Eastern coaches and sports
writers.

Meanwhile, A Washington was
King of the West, which gave them
the top spot in the nation—ho
Penn States or Alabamas to bring
them down.

0 The above being the case, if my
initial prediction is wrong, and the
Huskies finish undefeated, they
will win the national champion-
ship, regardless of margins of vic-
tory or strength of opposition.

skill.

Why? She keeps the team on
loose and fun terms. “Colleen has
the ability to break the ice in times
of team tension because of her
spontaneous sense of humor,” Bal-
dridge says. “She's the kind of
player that every team needs to pro-
mote team unity.”

With Ahern’s combined gifts,
Baldridge says that both the team
and Colleen have benefited greatly.

“Colleen has taken control this

. year because she has the responsi-

bility of being one of our tri-
captains,” Baldridge offers.“I feel
that with this added responsibility,
Colleen has brought out her confi-
dence in competition. That confi-
dence is reflected in her improved
skill as a player and in her fun-

loving attitude as. a leader.”

Both Ahern and Baldridge agree
that the 1982 season has been
Anern’s best year at Pitt.

“I feel this season is the best one
because everyone gets along so well
and that helps me to play better,”
Ahern says. “We are talented play-
ers with great attitudes.”

“I feel this year has been an
experimenting year because we are
bringing many things together in
our play,” Ahern continues “Next
year’s team will be a better one
because they will be more expe-
rienced, and although I won’t be
playing next year, I am happy with
our season because we have deve-
loped into a real team unit, notjust
11 to 20 individual players.”

"Colleen has come out of her
shell and has made a great turn-
around in her play,” Baldridge
says. “Colleen has improved
because she has disciplined herself
this year, she has become more
aware of things while she plays and
because the team itself has deve-
loped a sense of unity.”

The 1933 season will be one
without Colleen Ahern, who will
graduate this coming spring with a

degree in elementary education.”

She plans to teach elementary
school and coach high school field
hockey at her two former schools in
Buffalo, N.Y.

A goal of the 1983 field hockey
team will surely be to fill the void
opened by Ahern’s graduation.

The Pitt News, Wednesday October 2t), 

Lady Panther Lisa Lafuria serves up another winner.

Steady Lafuria Earns Spot

8; TIM DINGER

Senior Lisa Lafuria reflects ever-
ything that is right with the Lady
Panther tennis team.

“She’s a steady consistent
player,” says head coach George
Dieffenbach. “She plays a good
mental game and uses a smart court
strategy.”

Her consistency has earned her
the No. 2 spot on the Lady Panther
tennis team and a 7-2 singles record
this season, even though she sat out
last year because of illness.

“George (Dieffenbach) wanted
me to go out last year, but I wanted
to save myself until I could play
better.” explains Lafuria, a fifth
year senior. “I’ve changed my
major several times, so I knew I
would be back this year anyway.”

After training hard over the
summer, she recaptured her posi-
tion on the team, much to the plea-
sure of Dieffenbach.

“She’s very coachable,” he says,
“She’s not flashy, she listens to
what I say and she’s dependable.
It’s her ability to hit the ball back
over the net that makes her capable
of upsetting better people.”

Lafuria began her tennis career
eight years ago when a friend asked
her to play at a summer camp. She
liked the idea and has been playing
since, thanks to her father.

“I never had private lessons or
clubs,” she says. “My father would
take a lot of time on weekends to
teach me. He helped me the most in
tennis.” I

After four trips to state cham-
pionships in doubles for McDo-
well High School in Erie‘. Pa., she
came to Pitt as a scholarship’
athlete.

She was Pitt’s No. 3 singles her
freshman year and was on the No. 2
doubles team, where she was a con-
sistent winner.

Her sophomore and junior years
were less successful, partly due to
shifts in coaching personnel. Four
years and four coaches later came
Dieffenbach.

Dieffenbach‘s success is reflected

in Lafuria’s 7-2 singles and 6-2
doubles. records.

“George is a good coach, ” she
offered. “He motivates the team
and encourages all of _the players.”

But just as Lafuria seems to be
starting her career, it nears an end.

Her last regular-season match is
the match against Bucknell.

Her last collegiate competition
may be on Oct. 29-30 at Concord,
N.Y . where the Panthers will par-
ticipate in the Big East Champion-
-ships. Lafuria could qualify for the
National tournament.

“I’m looking forward to it. I
really hope I do well,” Lafuria
says.

Dieffenbach is expecting big
things from his No. 2 player. “I'm
counting on her to perform well.
She should have a good showing
and score some points for the team.
She’s improved throughout the
year and I’m looking for her to
peak at the Big East.”

Regardless of the outcome of the
Big East tournament, Lafuria will
end her ‘college career this
December, when she graduates
with a Liberal Arts degree-

After graduation, she plans to
stay in Pittsburgh, become a medi-
cal assistant at a local hospital and
possibly teach tennis on a part-
time basis.

“I’m still going to play,” she
says, “but I’m going to miss the
competition.”

Coaches Across Country,
Take Look At Polls 

By BRIAN BALK

To determine the best colle-
giate football team, many turn
to the weekly press polls. The
United Press International
(UPI) bases its decision on a
tally of votes by various college
coaches throughout the coun-
try. Quite often some ridiculous
situations arise.

0 “Hello, Coach Gerry
Faust? UPI calling. Can we
have your vote for No. 1 this
week?”

“Sure, but don’t let my
alumni know. I choose
Washington as the No. 1 team,”
says Faust. “They sure deserve
it, look who they beat———the San
Jose Spartans, California and
don’t forget those Oregon
Ducks—now that’s some stiff
competition.”

0 “Hello, Coach Sherrill,
UPI calling for your weekly No.
1 poll opinion.”

“Well, as of now, I have no
opinion of who should be
selected as No. l,” Sherrill says.

“How about the PittPanthers
They are 5-0 and have beaten
some of the finest teams in the
country," suggests the UPI
pollster.

“Pitt who?” Sherrill asks.

“The Panthers-, from
Pittsburgh.

“Oh, I vaguely remember
them now,” Sherrill declares.
“Good sturdy football pro-
gram, but no money.”

I “Hello, Coach Bryant, UPI
again for your weekly vote.
Who will it be this week to fill
that No. 1 seat?”

“Why do you ask that stupid
question, boy? You know I’ll
answer the ‘Tide’  the Bear
snaps.

“But Coach Bryant, you were
upset by Tennessee last Satur-
day, 35-28. Ijust thought...”

“Upset!” the Bear interrupts.
“That defeat was just a nasty

rumor that johnny Majors and
those fascist media people
started. We are undefeated, have
been and always will be! The
Tide will roll to a national
championship‘! You hear me,
boy?” shouts Bryant.

0 “Hello, is Mountaineer
coach Don Nehlen in?”

“I’m sorry, he is not in right
now,” answers his secretary.
“He is out looking at the latest
titanium—reinforced flap jackets
for quarterback Jeff Hostetler
and a reusable rubber goalpost
for WVU wins.”

0 “Good afternoon. Coach
Paterno? This is UPI. Can I
have your weekly vote of the
best team in the country?”

“Well, I don’t know who the
best team in the country is, burl
know Penn State is the happiest
team in the country. We’re also
the best looking. Did you ever
see the smiles on our boys after
they get tackled———they are just
happy to be out on the field.”

Mount Lebanon High in Pitts-
burgh.” In high school, he was the
state runner-up in that event.

“Now I run almost anything
they want me to,” he says. “First
they wanted a miler, then they
needed a fill-in on the 2-mile relay,
and now I’m running five and six
mile cross country races. You can
call me the utility infielder.”

Moorehead has many goals and
hopes that his potential is still in
the distance. When questioned
about these goals, he said, “I would
really like to qualify for nationals
in an individual event. That is my
ultimate goal. I believe if I have the
potential to do so, Coach Vasvary
will enable me to reach it.”

During this season, Moorehead
has had some good and bad times.
The summer was difficult because
he was suffering with a knee injury
that sidelined him for a considera-
ble period of time.

The fact that the team had no
coach at the beginning of the sea-
son did nothing to make the fall
any easier.

The Pitt News, Wednesday October 20, 1982

“The _team stayed in touch and
tried to keep track of workouts, but
the ball didn’t get rolling until
Coach Vasvary arrived.”

Since then, the team has com-
peted in two races. This Saturday,
at the Big East Championship, Pitt
faces the toughest competition that
a Pitt cross country team has seen
in years.

The competition will be wel-
comed; Pitt won its first race and
placed third in the second race.
Moorehead remarked, “The com-
petition was lacking.”

It will be anything but lacking at
the Big East Championship.

“Providence is a group of world-
class runners. You don't think
about competing with them
because they have an unbelievable
talent advantage. Then you look at
the rest of the field of teams and
you’re in awe.

“We will all have to run our best
races in order to finish with some
responsibility. That is just how
tough it will be.”

Moorehead’s past is replete with
many successes. In high schoo_1_, his

performances dictated recruiting
visits by such track powerhouses as
Penn State and Villanova.

He initially accepted a scholar-
ship at Wake Forest, where he later
had differences with the coaching
staff.

During the spring of his fresh-
man year, he visited Pittsburgh and
was eventually lured to Pitt by a
nationally contending 2-mile relay
team.

Since then, Moorehead has been
a running success at Pitt, as well as
an academic standout. When asked
how tough handling the running
and the books together is, he says,
“I have been able to get by pretty
well until now. This term has been
very tough, and I’m not exactly the
most intelligent, which means I
have to compensate with hard
work.”

Vasvary is aware of Mooreheads
ability. “He has all the potential to
become a great runner, but he
needs a good performance under
his belt to bolster his confidence.
He has been working very hard and
appears to be ready to run that big
race.”
