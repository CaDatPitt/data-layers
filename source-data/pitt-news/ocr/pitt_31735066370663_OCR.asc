WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1985

Pitt’s School of Pharmacy has
raised its tuition by more than 26
percent, but despite the large
increase, more students will be
attending the school this fall than
in the previous ‘year.

Tuition has risen from last
year's ﬁgure of $3,350 to'$4,230
as a result of Pitt’s new Five Year
Plan, which was adopted last
spring. Preliminary plans called
for the termination of the phar-
macy school due to the $300,000
difference between direct costs
and revenues. ‘

A compromise was then sub-
mitted by the school that
included the tuition hike, and it
was eventually ,adopted byr-the
university. . ‘

“We don’t want to raise the
tuition,” said‘ Dr. David Berg-
man, assistant dean of the
School of Pharmacy. “But it's
something that just can't be
helped.” -

, The tuition increase has not,
however, deterred students from
attending the school. Enrollment
this fall is set at 450, up from last
year's enrollment of 405.

“We expect a bigger freshman
class this year,",said Bergman.
“And part of the reason is the

Pharmacy tuition:
Students register
despite large hike

great demand for pharmacists
today. The need should continue
to go up_ for the next eight to 10
years, and possibly indefinitely.”

The Five Year Plan is also cal-
ling for a reduction in both
faculty and staff, although Berg-
man claimed that none of the
instructors will be eliminated.

“Several departments in‘ phar-
macology will be dropped,” said
Bergman. “However, the major-
ity of the faculty memberswill be
merged into other pharmacy
departments in the university.”

He added that the school will
lose some pharmacologists, “but
they will not be lost to the univer-
sity. None of the instructors will
be removed.” .

Also, faculty contracts are

‘_scheduled to :, drop uniformly -in
two terms, and classes will be
restructured.

The School of Dental Medi-
cine is expected to take on some
of the teaching burdenfalthough
a, merger has not yet occurred.

“We’ve talked about it many
times, but actually nothing has
happened, and we really don’t
know when it will,” said W.A.
George, associate dean of the
School of Dental Medicine. “So
as far as we’re concerned, we’re
operating as if its business as
usual.” ' '

Fortmore than 30 years, Carnegie
Institute’s Museum of Natural His-
tory in Oakland has been deprived
of one of its most prized exhibits, the
reconstructed skeleton of a 20,000-
year-old American mastodon.

Now, in celebration of Andrew
Carnegie’s 150th birthday, the mas-
todon is being given new life.
Funded by the institute, a second
reconstruction of the mastodon is
now in its second month of progress.

The mastodon was donated to the
institute by Carnegie in 1898, after it
had been discovered in Ice Age de-
posits near Waterloo, Ind.

The preparators of the section of
vertebrate fossils at the museum are
now in the process of remounting
the skeleton and correcting the mis-
takes made by the commercial
builders who originally assembled it.

Heading the reconstruction oper-
ation ~is paleontologist Allen
McCrady. McCrady graduated
from Pitt, in I953 with a degree in
law, but he has made paleontology
his livelihood for the past I0 years.
“It had been my hobby for more
than 25 years before I decided to

~ make it-my career,” he said.
"The task of reconstructing the-
 ..,tPe.s£9510n «is;_a A./cry.» .e2t9iti.ng_, one.

McCrady said. “Before this, I had
only worked with very small dis-
plays. The mastodon is by far the
largest I’ve done." .
Nobody is quite certain why’ the
mastodon was dismantled in the
1950s, but McCrady said he believes
the decision was made because parts
of the skeleton had begun to crum-
ble. “The skeleton is surprisingly
complete, however,” he said.
Along with repairing the
crumbled pieces, McCrady will cor-
rect the mistakes of the original

Playfair provides excitement

despite scheduling conflid.s

By John Zaphyr
The Pitt News

Despite last-minute concerns
about a conflict with the scheduling
of freshman activities during orien-
tation, more than 150 freshmen par-
ticipated in Pitt’s first Playfair, held
yesterday. _

Playfair, sponsored by the Stu-
dent Government Board, ispart of
the festivities of the Freshmen
Orientation that began last wee-
kend. It is designed to allow‘incom-
ing freshmen to meet one another
-and to feel more comfortable about
their surroundings. -

“It’s basically a. program‘ to help
break the ice,” said ‘SGB President
Luke Kluchko. “It’s a good way for
freshmen to open up and make new
friends.”

The program, led by Andy
Mozenter, who calls himself “Play-
fair's trainer,” is part pep rally, part
revival meeting and part “Simon
says.” If a student is shy and doesn’t
want’ to participate, forget‘ it —
throughout the hour-long session,
everybody either holds hands, locks
armsvor touches backs. No one is left
out. V

Twenty mi'nutes*befo're the start of ‘

Playfair, it looked as ifno one would
get a chance to meet anyone new.
The SGB members, all wearing blue

Playfair T-shirts, nearly outnum-

'bered the freshmen. They all "had
that harried look -of hosts at a party
where nobody shows up. There was
a clash of events — nearly five others
were scheduled at that same time —
and the students who‘ had filled
Forbes Quadrangle earlier for the
President’s Picnic were now scat-
tered throughout the university-.

-“I’m very disappointed,” said
Kluchko. “We were given this free

time to have Playfair well in advance

and now other events have been
scheduled at the same time. Tomor-

assemblers. “They bolted thingsion

_\ and hoped for the best. Back then, it

wasn’t so much an art as it is now,"
said McCrady. “I’m mounting the
mastodon in a totally different
fashion, and I’m hoping to have it
positioned as it would have been in
real " life. ”

One of the major mistakes made
when the mastodon was originally

A assembled was its length. “The origi-

nal display was more than 14 inches
longer than it should have been,”
said McCrady. “They used three-

row. morning there will be a lot of
memos sent out."

The coordinator for the freshmen
festivities, Robert Firth, would not
comment on the confusion.

“I had hoped that more students,
could have turned up," said Mozen-
ter. “I realize that there was a tough

schedule and many of the kids-

couldn‘t make it, but we can accom-

Amodate up to 2,000. If we do this

next year, I’d like to see the student
leaders bring the freshmen in them-
selves‘ so we can get a bigger turn-
out.” A ‘

Once the students did arrive, it

T

was non-stop action. Mozenter, a
little energetic man, led them
through ‘an entire series of games
and exercises but was always incom-

plete, control of the group. With his
‘$l».39 whistle and his loud voice, he‘
captained them through a “moon-

walk” that had nothing to do’with

Michael Jackson, a game of “slow-

motion tag” and a modern day ren-,

dition of The Tower of Babel.
The “moonwalk” got three people

together — two heldthe third person ’

McCrady is also. eliminating the
support poles that were positioned
under the mastodon’s torso. Instead,
he will use steel supports fashioned
to run perfectly under the skeleton’s
legs. “The support poles tookaway
from the display,” said McCrady.
“There will be only one pole used

when I’m finished, and that will be
under the mastodon’s head. The
head is simply. too heavy not to have
any support under it.” '

With_— two months of work com- 

pleted on the mastodon,.McCrady is
optimistic that a completion date’
can be reached within the next six
months. He also said he thinks the
work on the mastodon is only a start
for the museum. “I would hope that
this reconstruction is just the begin-

ning of a renovation program here at A

the museum,” said McCrady.

Living together with someone for the ﬁrst *
tifﬁe can be an “educational” experience.

And living with a long distance company
isn’t any different. Because some companies
may not give you all the services you’re used t
getting from AT&T. c

For instance, with some companies you have

i to spend a certain amount before you qualify for
their special volume discounts.With some
others, voice quality may vary. .

But when you choose AT&T, there won’t be

any surprises when you move in. You’ll get the

used to. .  

With calls that sound as close as next door.

Guaranteed 60% and 40% discounts off our Day

For the “slow-motion tag,"people
would try to latch on to one another
while running in slow motion. The
object was to get everybody con-
nected, and when somebody was
“tagged,” he/ she would form a team
and tag someone else. At the end,
they all got together in a big
football-like huddle and cheered.

The rendition of Babel was simply
utter chaos. Everybody screamed
out their month of birth at the same
time and then had to somehow find
somebody whose month matched.

Other events included “back-to-
back dancing” where the dance
partners never looked at one

where people who are feeling low or
depressed come to the front of the

crowd and receive a standing ova-
tion. The students really seemed to
enjoy Playfair.

“I loved it and would do it again
tomorrow,” ‘said freshman Bob
Buchanon. “Not as great as the
beach, but it was a good time.”

, ‘‘I had fun,” said Janet legal,
another freshman. “And I'd defi-
nitely do it again.”

So, despite the conﬂicts of the
events, Playfair was a success.

“At first it was shaky, but I think
everybody had a great time,” said
SGB member Karen Frost. “I hope
next year it will be even better."

“It was a courageous step for the
SGB,” said Mozenter. “It was a uni-

que experience, and when schools ’

bring us in, they always want us
back.”

Kluchko represents university   . O A

at 2 international conferences

By Nancy Quldi
Assistant News Editor

Efforts to improve the quality,

of higher education on an inter-
national level transcended politi-
cal barriers when university
presidents representing 800 uni-
versities and 120 countries met
for an International Association
of Universities conference held
recently at UCLA in California.

“The rectors cooperated and
communicated with one another
so well. It was a great inspiration
for those students who made it to
the conference,” said Luke
Kluchko, president of Pitt's Stu-
dent Government Board and the
university's only representative
at the IAU conference. “If the
world was run by chancellors,
international relations would be

~ all right.”

Students accompanied their
rectors to this year’s conference
to celebrate the United Nations’
International Year of Youth.
Kluchko was particularly urged
to attend in place of Pitt presi-
dent Wesley Posvar, who was
unable to attend this year.

“The students were there to
observe and to learn,” Kluchko
said, “but we were given voting
power, and two students even

ran for deputy positions on the p

board. This year, the youngest
voting member of the IAU was
an 18-year-old student from
USC." -

The conference focused on .
“The International Responsibili- ’

ties of Universities.” The rectors
discussed the decline of the
humanities and the international
trend toward ‘mathematics and
sciences.

Some universities
couldn’t afford to send’
their chancellors to Los

' Angeles for the confer-

ence. Some universities.
in Africa can ’t afford
books, let alone trips '
to Los Angeles. -

— Luke Kluchko
president,‘ SGB

“The rector ’ from Geneva
argued that universities have set
up stringent requirements for the
sciences but virtually no humani-
ties requirements," Kluchko
explained. “In opposition,_ some
supporters of the sciences argued
that in order to study the scien-
ces, a student is required to take
humanities courses.
humanities major need never
take a science course.”

Also discussed at the confer-

ence was the educational gap

between universities’ in deve-
loped countries and those in
third world countries. “The
separate needs of both Latin
American and African universi-
ties were recognized," Kluchko
said, “as well as how universities
in developed countries can sup-
port them.

But a.

“Latin American. countries
struggle with a tremendous debt

that compounds every year," -

Klulchko said. “Some universi-
ties couldn't afford to send their
chancellors to Los Angeles for
the conference. Some universi-
ties in Africa can't afford books,
let alone trips to Los Angeles.
“This was. the only near-
political issue discussed at the
conference," Kluchko said. ,
Rather than debate the issues,
members of the IAU used the
conference as an apolitical forum
to discuss common problems
and to seek solutions. ,
At the conclusion’ of the con-
ference, Kluchko joined 84 other
students for the first meeting of

the International Association of —

University Students, held at the
University of Southern Califor-_
nia. An organization designed
after the IAU, the IAUS is a non-
political student group,
assembled to promote under-

standing and to encourage

communication.

“Since it was our first meeting,
we were concerned with writing
the constitution and formally

establishing the association," _ i 
Kluchko said. “It was a lot of -  

work, but how many times do
you get the opportunity to sit

' with a student from Trinidad on
one side, a student from Portugal -

on the other and one from the
Phillipines across the table?”

“It was an opportunity to meet ‘

the real people who represent~

other countries rather than judg- .'
ing those countries by their A

governments," Kluchko said,
“because what makes a person;

our enemy is the fact that we’ . 

don't know him."

No room for
fair-weather fans

One wonders how many Pitt fans got ﬂushed out of the
bushes with Pitt’s 31-30 victory over Purdue on Saturday night.
It seemed that the same people who were claiming allegiance to
these Panthers over the weekend were the same people who
were calling for Foge Fazio’s head during the middle of last
year’s 3-7-1 season. . _

Is it the curse of Pittsburgh, America’s_No. 1 city, that this
town possesses the greatest percentage of fair-weather fans in
the country? Probably so.

With the Steelers’ successes over the past decade, it was hard
to uncover a fair-weather fan because the Steelers were always
winning. But with the disappointing Pitt season last year and
the drop-off in the Pirates’ play, Pittsburgh’s fans have once
again shown their true colors.

As Pitt struggled through that season, it got to the point
where Pitt students were actually cheering for the "opposition at
Pittgstadium. ' ‘ . ' -V ' ' -’ ' 7

. Fazio once again be accompanied in a sentence bya four-letter

word?

Pittsburgh fans are the first to jump on the wagon when a
team is winning and the first to head for the lifeboats when a
team is losing. These are the same people that booed Dan
Marina in 1981. They are quick to criticize and short on smarts.

It’s time to turn over a new leaf in Pittsburgh, to pick a team

and stick by it through thick and thin. It’s time to stop pointing '

ﬁngers, time to stop forcing the Dave Parkers and Cliff Stoudts
out of the city.

If Pittsburgh is America's No. 1 city, it must be No. i from
the air to the rivers, from the docks to the mills, and from the
sports teams to the fans. Otherwise, it is just another city.

 An,bience/ Trent Curtis   
  Just being myself

I’ve been thinking lately of my‘

freshman year. Especially the first
few weeks — how I felt, what I was
thinking. After some concentration,

the memories became clearer. Let

me explain.

I promised myself that I would
start anew when I came to Pitt. I
would also start to pursue interests I

felt inhibited from pursuing in high .

school, and so forth.
Things didn’t exactly ago as
planned.

Shortly after I got settled into my
Tower C room, I found myself
spending most of my time with this
guy from my high school whom I
hardly‘ even knew. I then began
doing things I had no intentions of
doing at college, like going to large
parties. I hate large parties.

This most unfortunate pattern of

behavior continued until I soon real-
ized that I was feeling completely
immobile. I felt even more stagnant
and suppressed than when I was in
high school. Not only was I not mak-
ing the changes I planned on mak-
ing, I was not breaking away from
my self-inhibiting high school ways.

Over the next few weeks, I
gathered my courage together. I
made the changes in myself and my
life I had originally intended to
make when I first got to Pitt.

’ First, I let the people I had met so
far. get to know and see “the real
me,” as it were,’including the guy
from my high school. Idecided to let
these people know what my genuine
interests and opinions were and to
not just go around agreeing with
practically everyone just to get
along. If these people really were to

be my friends, I decided, then they
would not stop spending time with
me after seeing the real me.

Things went really well, actually.
The guy from my high school has
turned out to be one of my best
friends. The others I met early on in
classes and such are still around,
too, for the most part.

I have to admit that I was-sur-
prised to see how accepting and
understanding these people were. It
just seems that they, too, were look-
ing for people to trust, befriend and
confide in.

Although I haven't had the easiest
or the hardest of times at Pitt, I will
always be grateful that I finally had
the sense and the courage to shed the
conforming and confining skins of
high school. I think I made a wise
exchange in choosing the licentious
and free skins of college.

BAS speaks out against apartheid  

‘We who stand against the injusti-
ces practiced by the South African

government are appalled at the Uni-
' versity of Pittsburgh's decision not

to divest totally.

It is very disturbing and painful to
us who place money into this uni-
versity’s hands, only to see what we
consider a practice of misappropria-
tion of funds. To say that you con-
demn apartheid in South Africa
means very little when you refuse to
divest! It reminds me of that old
cliche, “If you're not part of the solu-
tion, you're part of the problem.”

It should be known that we, the
Black Action Society, do not stand
alone on the issue of divestment. We

 have a great percentage of recog-

;...,,,.

nized fraternities, sororities, the Stu-
dent Government Board, College of
General Studies Student Govern-
ment Board, Affirmative Action

. Committee and other community

groups and organizations on our
side!

We, the Black Action Society, and .

the many other organizations that
hold the same divestment beliefs are
neither quixotic or hypocritical in
making divestment demands on this
university, but we unite to help bring
justice to those who cry out for our

help in their struggle for freedom.
We ask for divestment not as a
moral gesture, but to bring real pres-
sure on the regime! We say to you,
“Our cause is just and noble. We
dedicate ourselves to the freedom
struggle. We shall be free!" .

There are one billion and one
other promising investments to be

made other than companies that

deal within South Africa, but yet
you chose to aid those who keep our
brothers and sisters from freedom.
You choose to provide funds for a
country that demeans and oppresses

people because of the color of their.

skin. All that we can perceive from
your actions is that you condone the
actions of the white rulers of South
Africa who oppress our people,
because you keep investing our
money there. They oppress our
brothers and sisters by ordering
them to leave the main cities before
nightfall by incarcerating whoever
they see ﬁt without a warrant or
trial, by not allowing them to assem-

ble in groups, by placing cruel and *

unusual restrictions on black funer-
als, by not allowing them to vote and
by murdering blacks -because they
speak and fight for their rights
(something Americans fought for

 

and still fight for). _

. When they don't allow full citizen-
ship to non-whites are we to under-
stand that you still plan to be a part
of undermining worldwide efforts to
end apartheid? Are we to under-
stand that you plan to directly and
indirectly continue to send funds to
a country whose government practi-
ces forced relocations of blacks,
demands free entrance to blacks’ pri-
vate homes, seizes property and
detains without charge or reason
other than to keep the black man
down?

The United - Nations Security

_ Council asked for economic sanc-

tions. Does the board of trustees of
the University of Pittsburgh take
heed? No!
How many more must suffer
before we decide to do our part?
Ladies and gentlemen, the strug-

. gle continues for us as well as for our

brothers and sisters in South Africa.
By not divesting, you legitimize the
structure of apartheid with its many

you no conscience? Have you ever
stopped to think what it’s like for
black children to be abruptly awak-
ened by South African po1ice.offi-
cers kicking down the front door,
hauling their parents out of bed and
beating them in front of their child-
ren just because they speak out

against apartheid? Ladies and gen- '

tlemen, this is reality! The fact that
there are 23.9 million blacks com-
pared to 4.9 million whites and the
blacks have no representation in
parliament is reality! The fact that
my brothers and sisters in South
Africa are being treated less than
human is a reality! The fact that
blacks are murdered daily by whites
is a reality! Ladies and gentlemen of
the board, instead of investing
money in South Africa, why don't
-you just send the whips, chains and
selling blocks that President Botha
and those other children of Hitler
really want! Already they spend

three billion dollars yearly just to

help continue their apartheid practi-
ces. Are we, the people within this
university, expected to stand in the
shadow of your embarrassing deci-
sion and allow it to go unchallenged?
We say, “No!” -
To say that you are observing the

Sullivan principles (the corporate '
guidelines drafted by American ”
churchman Leon Sullivan in the late ~

’70s to ensure non-discriminatory
treatment of all employees in South
Africa workplaces) or “selective dii
vestment" as it is better known, is an
insult to the intelligence of the peo-
ple within this university. We know
that it has no effect on the South
African government's policies. Rid
yourselves of holdings in companies
with interest in South Africa,
because the argument that divest-
ment takes away black jobs is a very
weak one indeed. Sometimes you
have to take a step backwards to go
two steps forward, and what good is
a job without freedom?

We ask that you meet with us and
not try to. ignore this issue. With all -
due respect, we ask that you meet
with the Black Action Society and
representatives of other concerned
organizations within this university.
If divestment doesn’t take place at
this university, then the students of
Berkeley, Cornell, Harvard and
Iowa will not protest alone. This is
inevitable!

Communities ﬁght taverns  
in effort to curb disturbances

By susan Benedek
The Pitt News

On Sunday nights, Robert Moyer
can’t get to sleep. Moyer resides in
North Oakland, a few doors down
from a bar that holds under-21 night
on Sundays. By the time the music
stops and the patrons have
dispersed, it’s 3 a.m. ‘When Moyer
wakes at 6 a.m. to go to work, he has
to pick up empty beer bottles in his
front yard.

“I’ve tried calling the police, and
they tell me it’s the Liquor Control
Board‘s problem. The LCB says it’s
police business,” said Moyer. “This
has continued for the past two years.
The situation certainly is a round-
robin.”

Moyer, other residents and organ-
izations from various communities
throughout Pittsburgh expressed
their concerns about neighborhood
“nuisance bars” in a hearing before
the Pennsylvania House Liquor
Control Committee in Pittsburgh’s
City Council Chamber on Aug. 28.
The committee is conducting these
hearings across the state on two pro-
posed bills dealing with problem
bars.

Senate Bill 964 and House Bill
224, if enacted, would permit
anyone living within 500 feet of an
alleged problem bar to file a com-
plaint with the Attorney General's
Office in order to take legal action
against the licensed bar owner. The
proposed legislation would also
enpower the local police to write cit-
ations for liquor code violations.

Currently,
problem bars can only report their
grievences to the :Liquor Control
Board, which determines what
investigations or legal actions are to
be taken.

“We are not trying to close down
these places. We are only asking that

neighbors of such ,

"It is like pollution from the steel miIl.s,° it ‘s not just
the workers’ or the area resident's problem, but the
whole communityis problem  authority should be
in the hands of an elected official who would be

responsible to the community.

—Charles Martone
Swissvale mayor

the bar be a good neighbor by keep-
ing down the noise and keeping the

patrons inside,” said Moyer.

According to Pittsburgh’s public
safety director, John P. Norton, the
problem-bar issue has been one of
his “leading concerns” since his
appointment as director two months
ago. “Activity stemming from the
bars range from noise to narcotics to
tavern patrons urinating on nearby
front porches,” Norton said.

“As of right now, the police have
no enforcement power against the
holder of a bar license. We can make
arrests for a variety of violations like

drinking under age or prostitution,-

but we can’t cite the owner or the
bartender.” According to Norton,
the problem will continue as long as
the Liquor Control Board remains
as regulator of licensing procedures.

“From my point of view, I don't

_ see how the LCB can sell and regu-

late the licensing on one hand and
effectively enforce the liquor laws on
the other. I think the enforcement
effort should go to some state
agency or to the police.”

According to Norton, the Oak-
land area is easier to handle because
of the . college environment -
“obvious violations,”'such as under-
age-- drinking, are more easily
sighted. Other areas in Pittsburgh
need more individual attention
because the problem bars are widely
spread apart. ,

“There is always that one bar,”
stated Charles Martone, mayor of

Swissvale, at the Aug. 28 hearing.
“There seems to be a ﬂaw in jurisdic-
tion, with the police taking care of
the outside and the LCB taking care
of the inside of the bar. And you
can’t always have a policeman on
hand in front of the door.

Its like pollution from the steel
mills; it’s not just the workers’ or the
area residents’ problem - but the
whole communities’. I agree with the
essense of the bill  authority
should be in the hands of an elected
official who would be responsible to
the community.”

Gary DeVito, general legal coun-
sel to the LCB responded, “We have
a policy of investigating every corn-.
plaint. We do send agents out.”

B Other portions of the bill would
propose an increase in the maximum
fine from the current $500 to $1000
dollars to $5,000 against bar owner.
This legislation would also remove
the ability of bar owners to delay
enforcement of court order by the
appealate process.

According to Jeff Kelly, assistant
manager of the Decade, on Atwood
Street, “I think this is a good issuej-—
any type of illegality needs tohbe
addressed, whetherpit by the LCB or
the police. The police always tell‘-“us
to get it outside —- get the trouble-
makers to leave and they'll take care
of them. Repeat troublemakers
aren’t tolerated in our bar. We throw
them out for life. If you get rid: of
those people, there wouldn't be
problem bars.” ' ‘ P

Social work:

By Dan Bates
Interim Editor in Chief

After several years of planning
and almost a year of extensive
renovations, Pitt's School of
Social Work is finally united in
its new home in the Cathedral of
Learning.

The 21st, 22nd and 23rd floors
of the Cathedral now house the
school’s administrative office,
classrooms, a student lounge and
office space for teaching assist-
ants, fellows and doctoral
students. A

“The
enabled our faculty and students
to be housed together right here
in our school,” said administra-
tive assistant to the dean Rosie
Rinella, who headed the renova-
tion project. “Before, the school

was scattered all over the
campus.”
Offices were previously

located in Thackeray Hall and
the 12th floor of the Cathedral,
as well as the present location.
“When students and faculty
were housed in other buildings,
contacting them was very diffi-

them quickly."

renovations have -

cult,” Rinella said. “Now, they -
are accessible, and we can get to A —
' years old.

School completed;
departments unite

‘Renovations included the

‘remodeling of existing offices,

the creation of more office space
and the upgrading of office
equipment and furnishings.
Exact renovation costs are not
available, but Dean David
Epperson said ‘the costs were
approximately $200,000.
Although the renovation pro-
cess went smoothly, the School
of Social Work did have some
minor problems. According to
Rinella, faculty members were
temporarily dislocated, and
many faculty members had to
share space for a period of about
six weeks. ‘
“That caused problems,”
Rinella said. “And working out
of boxes for that amount of time
really made it crazy for awhile,

_ but we made it through.”

Last week, in honor of the ren-
ovation efforts, an open house
was held for all faculty, students
and local agencies involved with
the school. Four thousand invi-
tations were sent out, and over
600 people attended the gather-

ing, thus making it‘ a huge.
'. success.

Dean Epperson said he sees
the renovations as a “fresh look”.

Riots continue as S. African miners strike

Riots
Continue

(UPI) -— In Cape Town, racial
unrest persists. Police arrested 29
mixed-race South Africans Sept. 2
as youths barricaded streets and set
fire to buildings. Rioting also broke
out near Johannesburg, Pretoria
and East London.

Labor violence erupted after more
than 23 thousand ’mineworkers
walked off the job in Johannesburg.
Union leaders say l4 miners on
strike at five gold and coal mines
have been hurt since Sunday in
clashes with police and private
security guards. A union spokeswo-
man says the union stands by its‘
claim that black workers have been
marched to work at gunpoint as

mine owners try to break the strike.’ '

She says strikers also face dogs,
baton charges, rubber bullets and
tear gas.

Suspects
extradited

(UPI) — Eleven Puerto Rican
separatists accused of taking $7 mil-
lion in a 1983 armoured car robbery
were ordered extradited to Connec-
ticut to face charges. An attorney for
one of the suspects says he believes
they are now in federal custody in
New York.

Drug trial ’
jury picked

(UPI) — Jury selection began yes-
terday in the Pittsburgh federal trial
of a Philadelphia man charged with
peddling drugs to major-league
baseball players. The attorney for
the defendant, 38-year-old Curtis
Strong, wants to determine whether

any of the veniremen own stock in
professional sports franchises. The
prosecution wants to know if pros-
pective jurors think marijuana or
cocaine usage should be legalize.
Some players are expected to testify
on behalf of the prosecution.

Hurricane

(UPI) — Hurricane Elena, now

out of the'Gulf of Mexico, unleashed‘

all of its fury on the Mississippi
resort coastline, carrying with it 125-
mph winds and 12-foot tides. The
center of the 300-mile-wide storm
struck near Boloxi on Sept. 2, after
raking Florida’s panhandle and the
Alabama coast. .

National Guard troops and police
began’ patrolling the devastated
areas yesterday to prevent looting.
An overnight curfew was in effect as

A trio of Oakland eateries reviewe

 

iPeter’s~

Peter’: Pub, located at 116 Oak-

‘ . land Ave., is perhaps Oakland's spot

for the older-school crowd.
Peter's has a wide selection of
draft beers, the bartenders know
1 how to make a good drink and the
' crowd is usually tame and in good
~ spirits. This is the place to go for the
social drinker.
’ The two-room establishment
” prides itself on being one of the few

. .  bars in Oakland that does not charge
' you money to get through the front

door. That's where you save money
. right off the bat. Add to that specials

such as Peter’s Wednesday Night,

Import Night, when you can choose

 A from awide range of imported brews
“ . foronly $1 a bottle.

Peter’s other nightly specials
include Tuesdays, when draft and
bar drink prices are reduced and hot
dogs can be purchased for a quarter

“This has to be the best bar in
Oakland,” said Pitt co-ed Larry
Sanders. “I like the crowd that hangs

out [at Peter's]. Everybody knows

everybody else.”

According to Nick Herko, a bar-
tender at Peter’s, the bar serves
mainly business people during the
day, until the college crowd starts
coming in around 3:30 p.m.

“We serve a mixed crowd of col-
lege students,” he said, “not just one
stereotype. 'Peter’s is definitely a
non-segregated bar.”

Herko said that Peter’s is success-
ful because of the strength of its
reputation. V

“Our name gets passed around
because of our fast quality service,”
he said. “You put money on the
table, you want service as quickly as
possible. At Peter's, you get what
you pay for.”

“You can’t beat the prices,” added
Carlow College nursing sudcnt
Mary Beth Small. “College students
can’t afford to pay super high prices
when they go out. lt’s nice to have a
place like Peter's to go to.”

Eatery reviews  

Pinocchio’s

If ‘Gepetto (the creator of the

wooden “Pinocchio") were in Oak- '

land today and made his way over to
Michael Sorci’s restaurant, he may
be surprised to see over 20 of his
wooden friends scattered through-
out the restaurant and bar. These
wooden dolls will notcome alive;
they are just part of the decor in one
of Oakland’s newest escapes from
fast-food dining, Pinocchio’s.

Located at 4415 Fifth Ave. (that’s
Webster Hall), Pinocchio’s attracts
both young and old. The apartments
in the building bring in many custo-
mers as do events in Oakland. The
building houses only 20 percent stu-
dents, but many have found their
way to Pinocchio’s.

The restaurant sports a playful
decor. The. walls are painted with
fairy-tale-like animals, hot air bal-
loons and scenes of picnics and peo-
ple. Napkins are in assorted colors
and the chairs are plum and green.
The dress is casual for lunch and a
bit dressier in the evening. .

The menu at Pinocchio’s has a
variety of finger foods, soups and
salads, and it changes daily. Sand-
wiches are priced between $3.25 and
$5.25. Entrees featuring pasta,
chicken, meat and fish are available
starting at $5.95. One Pinocchio spe-
cial that sells extremely well is the
10-ounce ribeye steak with sauteed
mushrooms for $7.95. This price

‘ includes a big help-yourself salad

(available with any entree), a baked
potato and rolls.
Robert Johnson, 25, . was at

Pinocchio’s for the first time and ’

tried the ribeye special along with
the barbequed ribs for an appetizer.
“The ribs were bite-sized and really
tender. They brought out a plate of

steaks so I could choose the one I

lwanted. Everything was good,

including the service. I‘ll be back.”

The bar serves a variety of ice
cream “fun drinks,” including rasp-
berry barettos (Chambord, ama-

‘ retto and ice cream), creamsicles

(vodka, triple sec, orange juice and
ice cream) and aggravations (scotch,
Kahlua and ice cream). These drinks
are priced at $2.95. They also_serve a
variety of frozen drinks, including
four different kinds of slushes —

apricot, raspberry, strawberry and A

watermelon — for $1.95.
Pinocchio’s happy hour is Mon-
day through Friday evenings from 5
to 7 with reduced prices on all beer
and drinks. Drafts‘ are 75 cents,
domestic bottles are $1 and imports
are $1.75. Most mixed drinks are $2
and the popcorn is free.
Pinocchio’s also has the only
video jukebox in Pittsburgh. It's a
regular jukebox, but it has a video
screen on top of it. The TV screen

can also display the videos for the _
“jukebox and for 50 cents you can see

one of over 40 videos available.
There’s also a poker machine at
which to try your hand.

. Pinocchio’s has live entertain-
ment too. If jazz is your style, you’ll
like trombonist Harold Betters and
his group, one of September’s fea-
tured musicians.

The restaurant is open Monday
through-Thursday, ll a.m. to" 11
p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m.
to i a.m.; and Sunday ll a.m. to 9
p.m. Food and appetizers are served
in the bar until midnight on
weekends. '

Simply
French

Simply French, 344-46
Atwood St., is simply delicious,
and the establishment’s afforda-
ble prices will not hurt a colle-
giate _budget.

Having opened for business
Jan. I, the restaurant has already
acquired a group of regulars. On
Saturday night, the line stretches
out the door. And it’s not the
decor —— gold and velvet wall-
paper, stucco walls, vinyl table
cloths and gold lamps — that
keeps the people coming back. It

   

...-

is the consistently good food.

Everything on the menu is a la
carte, with the exception of hot
french rolls, which are served
with every meal. The menu offers
a variety of soups and other
appetizers, and the entrees range
from $3.95 to $1 I, with most fal-
ling between_ $5 and $7.

The soups are a great way to

begin your meal. Garnished with _

croutons and parsley, the gaspa-
cho ($1.50) is excellent. This
soup contains finely minced
vegetables and is spicy but not
overwhelming.

The mussel orange soup
($1.50), served warm, is not to be
missed. This interesting combi-
nation features a generous por-
tion of mussels and pieces of
onion in a ﬂavorful creamy broth
laced with orange. It is unusual
fare and representative of the
creativeness of chef Michael

Hooker.

The other appetizers are also
wonderful. The warm vegeta e
strudel ($2.25) is a house spe-
cialty and features cheese,
minced carrots and spinach
layered in pastry and served with
sour cream. ‘

Mussels dij on is another phen-
omenal appetizer. It can be had
as an appetizer ($2.75) or an
entree ($5.75), and in either case
will highlight the meal. The dijon
sauce is ﬂavorful, with a hint of
lemon. And be sure to eat the
mussels with a large soup spoon
to capture more of the sauce.

Fettucine ($3.95), another
entree, comes in a generous por-
tion and is topped with freshly
grated Parmesan cheese. It is
mild and creamy.

The orange mousse with choc-
olate sauce ($2.75) is a particu-
larly outstanding dessert. Served

in a wine glass, it consists of a
portion of smooth, creamy
orange confection shot through
with pieces of orange, a thin layer
of rich chocolate and a scoop of
whipped cream garnished with
chocolate shavings.

Another good dessert choice,
the cold chocolate souffle
($2.75), is a thick square of choc-
olate cake, served with a tangy
raspberry sauce.

Simply French does not have a
liquor license; however, it does
permit patrons to provide their
own alcoholic beverages, charg-
;ng a 50-cent-per-person corkage

ee.

The restaurant is open Mon-
day through Saturday, 4:30-9:30
p.m., and reservations are taken
only for parties of six or more on
weekdays. All major credit cards
are accepted.

Persgnal Diet center is

_l:l_ealth

The following article. is the first of a
series examining weight loss
programs.

By Nlccol Donnelly
The Pitt News

As I return to another year of
classes, I realize that my clothes fit a
little tighter than last fall; that is, if
they fit at all. Of course, I didn’t
wake up one morning and say: “Oh,
no, what happened? I’m fat.” I knew
I was gaining weight each time I
bought new clothes for size rather
than style. And each time I did this, I

‘ tried to lose weight. I dieted, fasted

and exercised. Somehow, I always
managed to gain back every pound I
sweated off. The effort didn’t seem
worth it. »
Unfortunately, I think that a lot of
college students can sympathize
with this situation. And with the fit-
ness craze and the media and medi-
cal drives to stay thin, developing an
effective weight-loss program is
becoming an obession with millions
of American men and women.
During my "search for the perfect
weight-loss program, I encountered
several facets of the weight control
industry — the fads and the facts,

the rights, the wrongs, the feasible
and the non-feasible options for col-
lege men and women. In this article,
diet centers will be examined.

A diet center is an organization
that weighs, counsels, measures and
monitors you on a speciﬁc diet plan.
I emphasize this type of weight con-
trol first because the diet center is
often used as a last resort. Yet, its
results (although the figures vary
from center to center) prove it to
have a high successrate. Perhaps it
would show an even higher rate of
success if it were utilized sooner.
Too many people wait until their
weight problem becomes extreme
before they consider a diet center.
This makes the price seem very high
because of the numerous weeks of
service required to take off a large
amount of weight.

The center I interviewed is
appropriately named “Diet Center.”
Most diet centers are similar to this
one, with variations in pre-prepared
foods, minor price differences and
diet supplements (usually pills or
powders). ‘ .

The Diet Center bases its diet on a
diet developed by Sybil Ferguson in
Rexburg, Idaho, over seven years

ago. She developed the diet plan

because she, too, was frustrated by

\her own, attempts to lose weight.

There are now over 2,000 weight-
loss programs offering her diet. The
Diet Center’s version has five stages:

Conditioning —‘ This is a two-day
period when you get your body used

to natural sugar by adding fresh fruit
to your diet. You also begin taking
vitamin C, Cal-mag (a calcium and
magnesium pill to make up for the
lack of dairy products in the diet)
and the Diet Center’s natural sup-
plement, made up primarily of
vitamin B. '

This supplement is essential to the
diet as it is taken every four hours
(two pills at a time) beginning at 7:30
a.m. It contains no drugs and is not a
sugar pill. Its purpose, however, is to
keep your blood sugar level up,
reduce sugar cravings, reduce
hunger and give you energy that you
get from the natural sugar in your
body.

During the conditioning phase
you eat a lot of fruit and are allowed
unlimited amounts of protein and
vegetables, but you must eat your
food in order: fruits, proteins and
breads. This phase ends after two
days.

Reducing —— During this phase
your food groups become limited in

/food choices. Your intake consists of
about 950 to 1,200 calories a day.
But the Diet Center stresses that the
diet is not based on calories.’ Instead,
you count grams of protein, carboh-
ydrates, fat, water, vitamins, miner-
als, fiber and bulk." This stage lasts
until you reach your desired weight;

Stabilization — Once you have
lost the weight you set out to lose,
you enter this stage. You are allowed
to add some of the foods lost in the
reducing stage to your diet, now

effective

./ ‘.-._ erg ,2» (Ow '3'; :41 Q-_,“ We

knowing how to compromise and
eat the better foods. This is to get the
body used to its new weight. You
remain in this stage one week for
every two weeks you spent in the
reducing stage.

Maintenance — After you stabil-
ize your body, you are put on a
maintenance program which allows
you free visits to the center for up to
52 weeks. This is to ensure that you
stay at your new weight. 0

Nutrition/ Behavior modification
classes -— This final stage of the Diet
Center's program is geared to ensure
a_permanence to your weight loss.
You are taught to make sound nutri-
tional choices and to plan you meals.
Other classes include food, prepara-
tion and eating habits. ..

You are instructed through each
phase with books and daily counsel-
ing. This includes free vitamin and
food samples, a food card for shop-
ping, informational pamphlets and a
before-and-after picture.

This diet works through a combi-
nation of processes. Although it
claims not to be based on water, it
does function in a similar manner.
The diet requires eight glasses of
water a day, and you are allowed
only two other drinks. It stresses the
importance of the body’s natural

~chemicals reacting to a complex-

carbohydrate diet plan.

The center also stresses the role of
the dieter as being crucial, to its suc-
cess. It is important to stick to the

. plan without substitution, to plan_ a

 

schedule enabling the dieter to eat

meals before 8 p.m., to visit the cen- ‘ I

ter daily and to engage in light
exercise. '

.There are numerous advantages 5

to this diet. It can be adapted to the

food available in the cafeteria with.-
minimal addition preparation, and I
it encourages the dieter to change his
eating habits, providing a lifetime -

maintenance program that is both
nutritional and effective.

Despite the positive benefits of the

diet, one problem is that the diet

center’s plan does not offer a variety . _

of foods and since substitutions are
not permitted, the diet may seem
inﬂexible.

Another drawback, especially for

college students, is that alcohol is’  27

not permitted. According to the diet,

it is set back three days with every- 3

drink.

The largest concern many stu- ‘

dents have when working with the
diet center is the cost of participating
in the program. Vitamins and sup-
plements must be purchased from
the center, and can add up to an
average price of $150. The diet plans
revolve around three, six and 10
week programs, at a rate of $150,
$270 and.$395, respectively.

While the diet center is an expen- v’ “
sive undertaking, the members boast - _
of results of 10-12 pounds in three 
weeks and up to 35 pounds in 10 

weeks..It does cost a lot of money
and may take a great deal of time to

factor is the desire to lose weight. If

_you have the money and the desire,

this may be the best non-traditional,
doctor-approved and nutritionally
balanced way to lose weight.

The Diet Center is located at 5824
Forbes Ave. in Squirrel Hill. The
center also has a branch in down-
town Pittsburgh. Call 422-DI ET for

In part two of this series, for those
who can't afford the Diet Center, the
various mixes, pills, books and
“dieting lifestyles” ranging in cost
from $1.99 and up will be examined.

The Student Health Service.
You’ve noticed the $36 at the bottom
of your tuition bill and you've
passed the brown brick office on the
first ﬂoor of Brackenridge Hall. But
what exactly is it?

“Most students associate the Stu-
dent Health Services with a place to
go where you get sick,-” said Shirley
Haberman, Pitt's health educator.
“But we’re also committed to help-
ing students stay well  preventing
sickness.”

According to Haberman, the
most used facet of the Student
Health Service is the general medi-

l cine —— examinations by physicians

for colds, sore throats, viruses,
sprained ankles and any type of fam-
ily doctor domain. But the center
also offers minor outpatient surgery
as well as treatment in the area of
dermatology, immunization injec-
tions and gynecology.

ealth service offers variety

The gynecological services are
located in Forbes Clinic, and are
also included in the student health
fee. These services include every-
thing from routine examinations to
contraceptive care and pregnancy
determination to treatment of sexu-
ally transmitted diseases.

To treat psychological problems,

the university also employs psychol- ‘

ogists and a psychiatrist, as well as
an alcohol counselor.
Another function of the student

health services is health education. ‘

“I'm disappointed with the program
at Pitt. A student can have four
years of education and never have
exposure to a health class,” said

more of _a self-help program in the
form of support groups to allow for
education.”

These support groups are initiated
either by student interest and sup-
port, or by a community group. Cur-
rently, the health service offers
programs in stress management,
alcohol awareness, eating disorders
and weight control.

dent focus, especially with the
women. Sometimes too much so,”

said Haberman. “It‘s really at the

Weight loss programs at the

health center focus on both nutrition ’

as well as exercise, and there are reg-
ular workshops offered in both.

According to Haberman, fresh-
men are more vulnerable to eating
disorders, stress and other disorders.

“Freshmen are the most suscepti-
ble because they are coming into a
new environment, cutting ties, mak-
ing new friends and this makes you
more susceptible to health prob-
lems," said Haberman.

This susceptibility applies espe-
cially to eating, disorders.

“Freshmen’s eating concerns
adjust with their lives, and a lot of
times they end up using food for
different reasons  to overcome
idleness, provide comfort or to
relieve boredom. We encourage
them to develop other interests, and
to join a group that gets you

Pitt dermatologist offers late summer sunburn advice

By Lisa Podrat
The Pitt News

Sun-worshipping has become a
year-round preoccupation. People
will do anything from sunbathing on
their lunch hours to vacationing
where the sun is hottest, whether
that be a tropical isle or a ski slope.
Even in September, the sun craze
continues with the last-minute tans
— browning before the bad weather
sets in.

What some don't realize or tend to
ignore is that each time you expose
yourself to the sun unprotected, you
increase the rate of your skin’s aging
process. And if you are a real sun

 

worshipper, you greatly increase

your chances of getting skin cancer. ‘

The American Cancer Society
estimates that almost all of the
300,000 cases of skin cancer deve-
loped by Americans annually are
considered to be sun-related.

The first time a child is overex-
posed to the sun to the point of burn-
ing, and each time thereafter, the
skin gets weaker and loses its elastic-
ity. This type of continuous expo-
sure to the sun can cause dark
patches and scaly grey growths
called keratoses, a prelude to skin
cancer. '

Dr. John Lenox, a staff dermatol-
ogist at the Student Health Service,

\

said:

“There is much too much

cancer we see coming from sun-
burns. Eventually the people who go
out and lie in the sun and get all of
this heavy tan are going to suffer
early aging of their skin, and without
a doubt, they’ll get wrinkles, dry
skin, and their skin will be more sus-
ceptible to cancer of one kind or
another. What we are seeing now is
mainly the damage that was done
30-40 years ago.” , »

If you spend a lot of time in the
sun, you should be aware of the early
warning signs of skin cancer. Most
skin cancers due to sun exposure are
curable and have visible early signs.
The American Cancer Society has

Byars out for Ohio State game with broken foot

Heisman Trophy candidate Keith V

Byars of Ohio State‘ will be lost to

 the Buckeyes for their season opener

/1 ‘turned an 11-point deﬁcit into a .
'three-point lead, or in the fourth

-. ,

against Pitt on Sept. 14. Byars, a 6-2,

236-lb. senior, suffered a broken.

bone in his right foot during football
practice on Labor Day. He was
expected to be the head of the Ohio
State offensive attack this season.
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio
expressed mixed emotions over the
news of Byars’ absence from the
Buckeye lineup. “I just like to cau-
tion our , squad,” said Fazio. “I
remember a couple of years ago we
went down to Maryland. Their start-
. ing quarterback couldn’t play, and
their second kid came in, and we
lost.” Fazio added, “It’s always nice
to say that you played against a
Heisman Trophy candidate and
gave it your best shot at him and
challenged him. I’m sure Keith feels
bad. We feel bad for him, but the

game goes on.”

Yes, it will, minus Byars, who Pitt V

fans will recall vividly from the
_Fiesta Bowl two years ago. Byars
had a dramatic 99-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown against Pitt
that proved to a big play in a game
that was decided in the waning
moments of the game. That was his
sophomore year. '

Last year, Byars joined the
nation’s backfield elite as he led the
nation in rushing, scoring and all-
purpose running. Over three sea-

sons, he has ‘gained 4,207 yards"

either through rushing, receiving or
kick-returning. He was the 1984 Big
10 Most Valuable Player, beating

out, among others, Purdue quarter- .
' back Jim Everett.

Against Illinois last year, Byars
had 274 yards rushing and scored
ﬁve touchdowns — some frighten-
ing statistics.

Who will replace Byars? Most
likely junior John Woolridge, a 5-
1 l, 190-lb.junior from Akron, Ohio.

Woolridge played against Pitt’s . H"

answer to Byars, tailback Charles
Gladman, inhigh school.
Woolridge is said to be a great
athlete. He runs a 40-yard dash in
4.42 seconds and lifts 600 lbs. He has
a 32-inch vertical leap and was the
Buckeyes’ second-leading ground

gainer last year with 663 yards. Not-

bad for a backup.

Whoever plays,’ it will be a chal-
lenge. Following Purdue’s blistering
of the Pitt secondary last weekend,
Fazio does not want other teams to
try to exploit the Pitt defense the
way Jim Everett did.

“It might be better if he were in
there,” said Fazio with a chuckle. “I
was telling someone this morning,
they might try and _pass the ball
now.” '

Panthers get off to good start   

put 1984 season behind them

Anyone who got to watch Satur-
day night’s Pitt-Purdue contest, at
one time‘ or another, saw visions of
1984 all over again. Whether it was
in the third quarter, when Purdue

quarter, when two interference calls

on Keith Tinsley kept’ the Boiler-

"maker’s hopes alive, it seemed like
we had seen this somewhere before.
. '“I felt the same way I did -two
years ago against Ohio State and

Penn State,” said Panther quarter- ’

back John Congemi, who passed for
110 yards on 10 completions, includ-
ing two’ touchdowns. “We didn’t
play all that badly to lose,” added
Congemi. “I just didn’t want to go
through that again.”

For a while, it seemed like it
would be Purdue who would be frus-
trated. The Panthers came out- like
gangbusters, as the offensive line
gave Purdue a lesson in pass and run
blocking. The Panthers pounded
out l2l yards rushing in the first
half, and would wind up with.234
yards on the ground when the ﬁnal
seconds ticked off the clock.

“Our offensive line was’unbelieva-
ble tonight,” said Congemi follow-
ing the game. “The offensive line
carried us tonight.”

When the offensive line was not

dominating the line of scrimmage,
the defense was. Led by Bill Sapio
and Tony Woods, the defense,
although allowing 398 yards
through the air,‘permitted only 66
yards on 34 carries onjthe ground.
Purdue quarterback Jim Everett
did his part in adding gray hairs to
Pitt coach Foge Fazio’s head. Eve-
rett completed 34 of 53 passes, three
for touchdowns,‘ and ran‘ £6:
another. ’

“I can’t» say enough about the Eve-

fett guy,” said Fazio of the senior ._

All-America candidate. “We were
trying to take away the deep curl,
and they ran their backs underneath
our linebackers.”

Everett did just that. He hit run-
ning backs Ray Wallace and Rod
Carter for a combined 15 passes,
almost half of his total completions.
It was not enough though. Everett-
capped a fine game with one of his
few miscues of the evening.

Following Purdue’s final‘ touch-
down, a 31-yard strike from Everett
to Wallace, the Boilermakers set up

.for the second of two two-point

conversion attempts. Following the
first, in which Tinsley was called for
interference, Everett rolled left, and
proceeded to throw a bounce pass to
tight end Jack Beery, who was wide,
and I mean wide, open in the end

. zone. 7

Congemi, who watched the play
at Fazio’s side on the Pitt sidelines,
remembered it well.

“We kept on getting bad breaks
the whole night,” recalled Congemi.
“In the end, though, we got the best
break of the night.”

Breaks seem to be going in Pitt’s
direction this year. One that went
especially in the Panthers’ direction
is the one in Keith Byars'right foot.

Byars, the senior all-everything
running back from Ohio State who
was a leading candidate for the Heis-
man Trophy, suffered a broken foot
, in practice on Monday, and will be
sidelined when the Panthers travel
to Ohio State on September 14.

PITT NOTES: The injury report
following this year’s opener is a lot
better than after last year’s opener.
Fazio reported that Bill Sapio
(ankle), Jerry Wall (ankle), Teryl

Austin (quad muscle) and Chris.

Ross (concussion) were the only cas-
ualties from the game. If the Pan-
thers had a game this weekend, Ross
would have been the only one who
could play. Pitt’s punting was a defi-
nite question going into the season,
but Fazio said the blocked Bill Rudi-
son punt during Saturday's game
was more a result of poor blocking
than of Rudison’s inexperience.

Ohio ‘State suffered a severe blow when tailback Keith Byars -

suffered a broken bone in his foot during a Labor Day practice '

Washington aims to

remain in Pitt lineup  

By Bob‘ Travers
Staff Writer

His first semester in college is not
one that Troy Washington is likely
to look back on with a great feeling
of accomplishment. Instead of play-
ing in the Panther defensive back-
field, the 6-2, 190-lb. Washington
was sitting out the year with a medi-
cal redshirt.

Washington got his first taste of
major college ball on Saturday in

» Pitt’s 31-30 win over Purdue. While

he did not make any spectacular

‘plays in the Pitt secondary or..com-

plete any interceptions, it was a good
start for the Duquesne native.
“This game was really an eye-
opener for me," he said after the
game. “I got to see how much faster
things move in Division 1 than they
did in high school, but it surprised
me a little just how much faster."
Still, it is easy to believe that
Washington prefers the fast track on

' the Pitt Stadium turf to the table in

the slower-paced training room. “It
was pretty tough last year with the
redshirt," he said. “I had to just sit
and watch instead of being out there
with them." ‘

A redshirt. however, does have its

advantages. It gives a player a whole

year to learn the scheme of things
without putting his job on the line
every Saturday. This is the case with
Washington.

“I think being around here last
year will help. but what really helped
me was some of theolder players
teaching me things, showing me
what to do. Bill Callahan was a real
big help to nie.“

Now Washington is ready to
become a permanent fixture in the
Pitt secondary. “I hope I play all

year. ljust went out and played my.

best tonight.“

‘Washington. due to last year’s
redshirt. has four years of eligibility
left and was listed as the only Pitt

_  fres.hman.jto start against-Purdue. 4

Troy Washington

“I think getting this first game
under my belt was good for me. You
always have pre-game jitters. butil

think that in the next game I'll be a.

little more ready for what's going
on.“

That next game will be Sept. l4 at
Ohio State — a team known as

much for its running as Purdue is for V
its passing attack. That game could '

provide a bit of a breather for the
Pitt secondary that was bombarded.
‘with 53 Jim Everett passes.
“All during camp the coaches kept.
stressing to us again and again’ that

Purdue would pass. The one thing

that surprised me about their pass‘-.
ing game was the fact that they
didn't go long as much as I thought
they would." 
Washington admitted he thought

the Boilers would pick on his side of

the field more. “I thought with me
being the freshman out (there. they‘
would come at me.“ he said. Instead.

The Pitt News
Show a little faith
There’s Magic in the night
~ Bruce Springsteen

There was magic in the night Aug.
31, when the first night game in Pitt
history took place. Not only was
everybody there treated to a football
game they will not soon forget, there
was also something that had been
sorely lacking at Pitt football games
in recent years: the spirit of fun.

There was nary a boo to be heard
from the nearly full student section.
The folks in Pitt stadium on Aug. 31
really wanted Pitt to win.

All day Saturday the threat of rain
lingered. Ominous dark clouds hung
over Oakland like the disappoint-
ment of last autumn. But in the min-
utes before kickoff the clouds rolled
up and sailed to the east, leaving the
dusk sky clean, dotted only by the

 - Goodyear blimp.

Far below were the students,
many in Pitt Stadium for the first
time, garbed in clothes on this chilly
August night that would have been
better ' suited to an October
afternoon.

As I watched the crowd’s emo-
tions soar _and then fall with the for-
tunes of the game, one thought
crossed my mind over and over ——
the feeling here is not of big-time
college athletics but of a high school
game between two bitter rivals. It’s
just that you didn’_t know as many
players on the team as you did in

  Are niht games n the future for Pitt?

high school, and there were a few
more classmates in the stands.
Remember how in high school after
the game you went out to McDon-
alds or Pizza Hut with everybody‘?
Well, did anyone go straight home
after Saturday’s game?

The Purdue game was the most
fun I’ve ever had at a Pitt game. and
I don't think I’m alone in the senti-
ment. 1 also think that Pitt should
play all their home games at night. If
nothing else, the move could turn
out to be an economic bonanza for

“The question of
whether we want to have
night football on a regu-
lar basis is one we want
to explore.” '

-1- Dr. Ed Bozik

the Pitt athletic department, and
after the dismal crowds of -last year,
the department could use a few more
dollars in the kettle.

The crowd Saturday was given as
50,103. That’s quite a jump from the
40,000 plus that gathered at last
year’s opener with Brigham Young.

While a complete nighttime sche-

dule is a rarity in rural and small
college towns, universities in several
metropolitan centers in the United
States play solely under thelights.
Tulane in New Orleans, San Diego
State, Minnesota in Minneapolis
and Arizona St. in Tucson all play a
complete night schedule.

Schools in such cities as Miami,
Houston and Albuquerque play a
partial night schedule.

Already there is talk of moving a
future 1985 game to night. _

At a media luncheon yesterday,
athletic director Ed Bozik said, “The
question of whether we want to have
night football on a regular basis is
one we want to explore.” Bozik went

on to promise a marketing survey of .

fans to “find out what their expecta-
tions of night football are.”

Bozik also spoke of past efforts to
look into the possibility of installing
lights at the stadium, but it was
determined the costs would have
been prohibitive. In the most recent
study conducted, it was estimated
the installation—of*permanent lights
to be between $500,000 and

_$600,000. About the only definite

Bozik gave on the subject was in
saying there will be no permanent

. lights installed this year, although he

left open the possibility that they’ be

_ put in next fall.

So for now the talk will go on,
plans will be made and reformulated
again and again and maybe some-
thing definite will be ironed out. But

‘ there is the memory of a game that

will stay with me‘ all season, no mat-
ter the wins and losses, and remind
me that once there was some kind of
magic in the night.

1985 summer sports review

Calipari named to
basketball staff

(Editor's Note: .Reprinted from
The Pitt News Summer Magazine.)

Pitt men’s basketball coach Dr.
Roy Chipman named 26-year-old
John Calipari to replace Jay Eck as
an assistant basketball coach. Cali-
pari was an assistant at Kansas Uni-
versity the past three years (first
under Ted Owens, then under Larry
Brown). Eck resigned in May ‘to
move on to the head coaching job at
the University of Wisconsin-Stevens
Point. I

Calipari, a native of nearby
Coraopolis, was ecstatic as he spoke
from his soon to be former office at
KU. “I’m moving back home," said
Calipari, who is no stranger to many
parts of the Pitt program. Calipari is
a former pupil of Pitt assistant Joe
DeGregorio. DeGregorio coached
at Clarion State before joining Pitt
and Calipari was his starting point
guard during the ’80-'81 and ’8l-’82
seasons as the Eagles were NCAA
tournament participants.

How Calipari came to Pitt is an
interesting story. “I was not looking
for a job,” stressed Calipari. “I just
heard about the_ opening near my
home, so I jumped at the chance.”
Calipari added, “When I was in
Pittsburgh for the interview, I was
still not sure whether I wanted the

job or not, but after meeting with ‘

coach Chipman, I was hooked. I was
in a great situation [at Kansas], but
coming home and being back with
my family, along with Pitt being in
the Big East, the best conference in
the nation with a team on the rise,
was too much to pass up.”
Calipari spoke of his duties very
frankly. “I’m here to recruit," said
Calipari. “That’s why I was hired,
and that’s what I'm going to be

doing." Chipman knows he got a‘

good man. “He’s developed into an
outstanding recruiter and teacher of
the game while at Kansas,” said
Chipman.

Pitt will remember the tough bat-
tle Calipari and the other Kansas
coaches gave them a few years back
for the services of guard Curtis
Aiken. Aiken was a Parade All-
America from Buffalo, N.Y. who
swayed between Kansas and Pitt
before choosing Pitt. Aiken will be
one of the first projects for Calipari
when he begins services here at Pitt,
and he is looking forward to it. “I
want to really spend some time with
Curtis Aiken,” said Calipari.
“Coach Chipman told me that Cur-
tis did pretty good last year, but we
want him to develop and play the
way we know" he can."

Bruce appointed
women’s coach

After weeks of speculation, the
University -of Pittsburgh Athletic
Department officially announced
the hiring of Kirk Bruce as the head
coach of the women's basketball
team. Former coach Judy Saurer
resigned in April, havingjust com-
pleted her fifth season as the Lady
Panthers‘ head coach.

Bruce served as an assistant coach
under Saurer this past season and
was responsible for recruiting anti
on-the-floor coaching. He was pre-
viously head coach at Clairton High
School where he led the boys‘ team
to a I22-S5 record in seven seasons.
His 1978 team won the WPIAL state

championship and four other teams
made the state tournament.

He was a standout guard for Pitt
in the early 705, leading the team in
scoring in I974 with a I7-point aver-
age. His sister Jennifer became the
all-time leading scorer in basketball

history at Pitt this past season.

After a disappointing I6-I2 sea-
son last year, Bruce said that he feels
that some changes must be made.
“The basis of them will be attitude
changes,” he said. “I want to try and
instill in these players the confidence
that they can get the job done. As far
as the X and O are concerned, I’m
sure there are going to be some
changes there, too.“

Over the entire season last year,
the Lady Panthers‘ inconsistency
was highly noticeable. Bruce said he
feels that the inconsistent play was
due to physical and mental lapses.
He hopes to remedy the situation
using his own coaching philosophy.

“I think it boils down lathe way I
would like to see these particular I2
girls play," he said. “When they step
across those lines, they're going to
give me I00 percent, whatever that
may be. Whatever they can give, I
want it. '

“The other part is that they must
be mentally prepared. I don‘t want
to get in the middle ofthe game and
have to make a, thousand adjust-
ments in order to get things done. I
want them to be prepared whenthey
step on the floor for whatever oppo-
nent we have that particular night."

Last year's team has been deci-
mated by graduation, claiming the
top three leading scorers and
rebounders and much of the bench
strength.

Bruce said that all I2 players must
contribute to this year's team. “I

‘ think it's going to have to be a con-

certed effort for everybody involved
to do the best they can to replace
those three players," he said. “It
must be a team effort and not just
one individual.'‘‘

Bruce said that the Lady Panthers
may rely on emotion to pull some
upsets this year. “A lot of these girls
have something‘ to prove, that they
are_a part of this team," he said.
“Sometimes when you play like that,
you get performances from people
you never expect to give them.

“I think a lot of the players will be
playing inspired with a little more
pride within themselves because
they have a chance to do a little more
playing than they did last year. I
think if we play like that, we'll win
our share of games.“

Among the players, the choice to
name Kirk Bruce as head coach has
been met with approval. “I think it's
great for the whole team," said
sophomore forward Sally Sheerer.
“He knows the girls, and we're all
going to work well together."

“I think that it was something
good that happened to the pro-
gram," said Ellen Gilhoolev. “He
relates well with the players and is
willing to listen to the players‘ point
of view and work out a
compromise.“

As Rollie Massimino proved, you
don‘t always need .\the biggest,
strongest and fastest players to win.
A positive attitude is just as impor-
tant. Said Sheerer. “I think our atti-
tudes will change for the better. The
feeling and attitude of Coach Bruce
are positive, and it will carry over to
the team." -

Jelic taken in
baseball draft

The Kansas City Royals made

’ Pitt catcher Chris Jelic their second-

round draft choice in the regular
phase of the annual Major League
Baseball June draft. Jelic, a 6-0, 185-
Ibs. catcher from Mt. Lebanon,
came to Pitt on a football scholar-
ship, but joined up with coach
Bobby Lewis on the Panther base-
ball team. After a stint in the out-
field, Jelic was switched to catcher,
and developed into one of the top
prospects in the country.

Jelic was voted team MVP by his
teammates after he batted .426 and
finished third in the Big East batting
race. His performance deemed first-
team All-Big East recognition at the
catcher position. Jelic was the 45th
player selected overall in the regular
phase.

Bob Prince dies
of throat cancer

Pittsburgh sports fans lost a true
friend when Bob Prince, the voice of
the Pittsburgh Pirates, died at
Presbyterian University Hospital.
Prince, fondly called “The Gunner"
by Pittsburgh sports fans for his
rapid-ﬁre delivery, had a career that
spanned five decades before he suc-
cumbed to cancer at the age of 68.

Prince had undergone surgery to
remove cancerous tumors under his
tongue earlier this spring, but
returned to the Pirate broadcast
booth for the first time since 1975 on
May 3. The Gunner was only able to
work three ballgames before pneu-
monia sent him back to‘ the hospital
for the last time.

The Gunner's popularity among. ,
Pittsburgh sports fans was ~unparal- ’

leled by any other media personal-
ity. Prince coined colorful baseball

expressions such as “Kiss it good-

bye!” and “Bug on the rug,” and
became an institution in Pittsburgh
Pirate baseball. His association with
the Pirates ended in '75 when radio

station KDKA, the ﬂagship station_

of Pirates broadcast network, dis-
missed Prince amid, public protests
and controversy.

The Gunner will be missed by all,

MacElroy to be
Gavitt’s assistant

Tom McElroy, director of com-
munications for the Big East confer-
ence. f or the past four years, has been
promoted to assistant commissio-
ner/ public relations, according to
Dave Gavitt, Big East commission-
er. '

Gavitt, in making the announce-
ment, ‘said, “Our directors are
delighted with the job Tom has done
for us. During his four years with the
Big East, his administrative respon-
sibilities have increased each year.
As a result, we felt it was time to
reward him for his performance with
this promotion. In Tom McElroy,
the Big East has the finest communi-

cations and promotions director in

college athletics today."

McElroy joined the Big East in
August, 1981 after seven years with
the Office of University Relations at
St. Bonaventure University. From
1977 to his Big East appointment, he
was the director of public relations
and sports information at St.
Bonaventure.

Pitt heads tough Big East
recruiting class with Cooper lame

(Editor's Note: This story was
reprinted from The Pitt News
Weekly.)

With the graduation of Patrick
Ewing, Chris Mullin, Ed Pinckney,
Bill Martin — the list goes on and on
— the Big East has found itself in the
process of rebuilding to match the
power the conference possessed last
year when three Big East teams —
St. John’s, Georgetown, and even-
tual national champion Villanova —

' all competed in the ﬁnal-four.

The Big East class of ’89 does not
produce the hype that Ewing did
when he signed with. Georgetown,
but talent wise, Big East coaches
should remain happy, and you can
bet the money will keep.flowing.
Competing in the Big East next year

. will be the 1985 Players of the Year

from Boston, Ohio, New York State
and Washington, D.C. While that is
no surprise in itself, the real surprise
is, who they will be playing for.
Unlike the last few years when Geor-
getown seemed to be landing all the
better players, the wealth has begun
to spread out among the other teams
in the conference. This past year saw
Seton Hall and Pitt, among other
teams, to have outstanding recruit-
ing years.

Seton Hall signed six new players
to their outstanding sophomore
class to‘ form a strong nucleus for
next year. Pirate coach P.J. Carle-
simo raided the New York City area

for ﬁve of those new recruits, three . .

of which were all-city.perfdrni'ers..
Gerald “General" Greene, a _28-
ppg scorer from Brooklyn, could be
running the offense for’Seton Hall at
the start of next season, a strategy

that would allow sophomore James .

Major to the off-guard spot.
Another freshman who should

‘help out immediately -will be New

York State Player of the Year Daryll
Walker. Walker averaged over 21-

ppg and over 13-rpg last year as he ~

led his Bronx All-Hallows High
School to the state championship,
being named MVP in the process.

Khyiem Long is the third all-city,

performer, but in 1983, Long sat out
a year after graduating from Bronx
Adlai Stevenson in 1984, the same
high school that produced ‘Pinck-
ney. Long averaged 19 points and 12
rebounds his senior year, and shot a
hot 71 percent from the field. Add to
that guard John Morton, a 6-2
guard who led New York City in
scoring last year witlia 36-ppg aver-
age, and Frank Torruella, a 7-0 cen-
ter, and you have a strong recruiting
class. But that is not all. Carlesimo
added the top prospect from Puerto
Rico, Ramon Ramos, a 6-8, 235-lbs.
center. ‘

Pitt, in the same mold as Seton
Hall, added another strong class to
their already strong sophomore
class. Roy Chipman signed a player
rated as high as the second best pros-
pect in the country, in 6-6 guard-
forward Jerome Lane from Akron,
Ohio The addition of Lane could be
the difference in Pitt cracking the
Top-20 next year. In short, Lane can
virtually do it all. En route to
becoming the Ohio Player of the
Year last winter, Lane averaged 27
points, 14 rebounds‘ and seven
assists as he led St. Vincent-St. Mary
High School to the Ohio AA
championship.

Chipman also tied up a loose end
with the signing of Tico Cooper, a
6-9 center. from Allegheny Com-
munity College in Pittsburgh.
Cooper averaged 14.1-ppg and 11.2-
rpg in coach Bill Shay’s no-star sys-
tem at ACC. With the graduation of
Andre Williams, should Keith Arm-
strong not fit Chipman’s expecta-
tions, Cooper could be the key. With

Cooper, Lane and Charles Smith
teamed up, Pitt could have their
most intimidating front line since
the days when Sam Clancy patrolled
the baselines at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Guard Mike Goodson might also
see some action.., A 6-3 defensive
demon from Elizabeth, N.J., Good-
son was ranked in the Top-30 point
guards in the country last year. With
the return of Joey David, Demetreus
Gore and Curtis Aiken, Goodson’s
time may be limited. _ But if the-
absence of a true point guard in the
Pitt attack is as evident as it was last
year, Chipman coul turn to
Goodson. ‘ '

Steve Maslek, a 6-8 center from
Freedom, rounded out the Pitt
recruiting class. Maslek is not
expected to have the same impact as
Lane, Cooper and Goodson, but he
will eventually play.

Georgetown suffered perhaps the
most devastating loss in the confer-
ence in Patrick Ewing. It is not even
sensible trying to replace Ewing,
because his shoes cannot be filled.
Coach John Thompson gave it the

2 old college try, and he did a fine job.
"Thompson landed 6-9, 245-lb.

bayou giant Jonathan Edwards
from New Orleans, La. Edwards is
bringing in some

10 blocks. If Edwards even
approaches producing the effect that
Ewing had in the Hoya pressure
defense, Georgetown could be tough
again.

Thompson also landed another
Dunbar High School product, 6-7
Darryl _Prue. ‘Prue follows in the

footsteps of Hoya's David Wingate.

and Reggie Williams, both Dunbar
graduates, and could fill the void-at
power forward left by the gradua-
tion of Billy Martin. .

Other Hoya recruits include Bob
Winston, a 6-5 guard from Washing-
ton, D.C., and Jaren Jackson, a
player Thompson took a chance on.

Jackson sat out most of last year _

with a stress fracture in his foot and
wasn't as heavily recruited as the
other Hoya prospects.

Boston College and Coach Gary
Williams have added five new play-
ers. Williams‘ prize is Kelly Monroe.
Monroe, an all-state performer from
Connecticut, is a 6-5 swingman.
Monroe averaged over 23 ppg last
year and shot 59 percentfrom the
field. Williams also added Dana
Barros, a 5-10 guard who averaged
over 36 ppg last in route to being

- named Boston Player of the Year;

Steve Benton, a double-ﬁgure scorer
from Philadelphia; Gary Cole, a 7-0
exchange student from England;
and Tom Hjerpe, a 6-8 forward from
Worcester, Mass.

Connecticut coach Dom Perno-

had the smallest recruiting class in
the conference, adding only two new
players to a seasoned returning
group. The notion that good things
come in small packages held true
here. Perno signed one of the top
forward prospects in the country, 6-
9 forward Cliff Robinson. Robin-
son, from Buffalo, N. Y., averaged
22 ppg, 12 rpg, four blocks, three
steals and three assists. He’s the type
of player you want to build a pro-
gram around. Robinson is said to be
tough inside but can also hit the
jumper from 18 feet. Remind you of
anyone, Pitt fans?

UConn also added a quality guard
in Phil Gamble. Gamble hails from
Washington, D.C., where he led All
Saints High School to an 18-0 mark
last year with a 24 ppg average.

Providence and Coach Rick Pit-
ino followed in suit with UConn, a
small recruiting class of only three

impressive -
‘numbers. Try 21.7 ppg, 18 rpg and

players. Pitino, however, was faced
with a small problem — he was not
hired until mid-March, late in the
recruiting year, after Joe Mullaney
retired. Despite the late start, Pitino
did not do bad at all. The Friars
added a very talented athlete in 6-5
Bryan Benham, an all-state per-
former in three different sports at
Catersville High School in Georgia.
Pitino also signed Bronx product
Darryl Wright, a second-team all-
New York City performer, and

Patrick Mosley, a 19 ppg scorer

from Atlanta, Ga.

One other addition to Pitino’s
squad is 6-8 transfer David Sne-
deker. Snedeker came over from
Iowa where he played sparingly and
will not be eligible until the 1986
season.

St. John’s was faced with the task
of replacing Bill Wennington and
Chris Mullin as the heart of their
team, but -just as in the case of
Georgetown, this might not be pos-
sible. Louie Carnesecca gave it a
good effort though. Carnesecca
added Marco Baldi, a 6-11 Italian
who graduated from the same high
school, Lutheran, that produced
previous Redmen post men Wayne
McCoy and Wennington. -

Kevin Fitzpatrick, a 6-0 guard, is
the only other high school player in
the Redmen recruiting class, but
three transfers become eligible. The

first is Greg Jones, Shelton‘s older .

brother, from Suffolk County junior
college; John Hempel, a 6-7 froward
via the University of Massachus-
setts; and Matt Brust, a 6-4 guard-

forward who left Dean Smith and ‘

North Carolina. If St. John's has the
same success it had with other
transfers (example: Walter Berry),
look out.

That leaves Syracuse and Villa-
nova. Syracuse signed one recruit
who will have an immediate effect,
6-9 power forward Rodney Walker
from Baltimore, Md. One of the Top
10 front line prospects in the'coun-
try, Walker will team with Wendell
Alexis opposite Rafael Addison.
The other two recruits are players of
the future: 6-I guard Sherman
Douglas, the D.C. Player of the
Year, will eventually replace Pearl
Washington, and 6-11 Erik Rogers,
from California, will back up Rony
Seikaly.

Villanova had a good recruiting
year, and now that Rollie Massi-
mine is definitely coming back, it
could be a happy year for Wildcats
again. Replacing a player like Ed
Pinckney is as hard as replacing
Ewing or Mullin, but Massimino
also had to replace Dwayne
McClain and Gary McLain. He did
both. Massimino signed 5-9 point
guard Kenny Wilson from Jersey
City, N.J. Wilson, rated as one of the
Top 10 point guard prospects in the
country last year, will eventually
replace Gary McLain.

As for high-flying Dwayne
McClain, the Wildcats signed two
players capable of filling the shoes:
6-6 Doug West from Altoona, MVP
in the Dapper Dan Roundball Clas-
sic, and 6-5 Gary Massey from the
Bronx. Both were all-state, and both
are considered great athletes.

Indeed, the Big East was a confer-
ence that had no parallel last year.
Ewing, Mullin, Pinckney, Martin,
McClain —- there will most likely
never be a class like the class of ’85
again. But then again, we might be
saying the same thing about the class
of ’89 four years from now.

   Volleyballteam cracks the national Top 20

  

By Michael Bertonaschl

ThePlttNews

Most college volleyball teams
would not expect to begin the season
nationally ranked after losing their
best offensive performer to gradua-

“ ' tion. Such is the case with the Pitt

Lady Panthers.

Two of the more prestigious pub-
lications, Women's Sports and Vol-
leyball Monthly rank Pitt as the l8th
best team in the country and No. 1
team in the East.

Although Ulana Kohutiak is
gone, she led Pitt in almost every
offensive category and was named

 honorable mention All-America,

the Panthers continue to receive
national recognition.

Their ranking is based on .a 30-8
record and Big East Championship
in 1984. Head coach Shelton Collier

A also had hisbest recruiting year ever,

signing the best players from Ohio,
Pennsylvania and New York. Add

. to that a core of returning veterans

and two outstanding transfer play-
ers and you get a national calibre
team. ,

 

As any college coach can tell you,
once a team receives national atten-
tion, the pressure intensities. The
Lady Panthers will be no exception.
“It puts a little more pressure on all
of us," said Collier. “There is a
responsibility for us now to repres-

ent ourselves as the eighteenth best

team in the country.”

Pressure has been known to feast
on young college athletes, turning
legs to rubber and throats lumpy.
But Collier will have no sympathy
for any player who is unable to
respond to the challenge. “There’s
nothing wrong with a little extra
pressure,” he said. “A lot of teams
would like to be in our shoes. With
220 teams wanting our spot in the
pools, I say tough luck if the pres-
sure is there. I think we have to learn
to respond to it."

Senior setter Judy Young agrees
with her coach. “The ranking puts a
lot more pressure on us, but then, we
want to be ranked, so it should be
that way.”

The Panthers got ready for the
season by traveling to Ohio Sept. 1
for a tournament against Akron and
Cleveland State. Collier used the
exhibition matches to evaluate play-
ers and different lineup possibilities
and to see how his young team was
progressing,

Shelton Collier

“This past weekend we showed
signs of potential brilliance and
signs that we have a lot of work to
do,” he said.

The season begins on the road this .

weekend in a tournament against
Dayton, Kent State and Michigan.
Unfortunately, Pitt will be without
the services of sophomore outside

hitters Louise O’Shaughnessy ana‘

Noreen Coughlin.

improved player by her teammates
last year, has a stress fracture in her
foot. According to Collier, she was
playing the best volleyball of her
career and looking like a candidate
for a starting position. She will be
out for two to three weeks.
Coughlin, transfer from the Air
Force Academy, will not play

because her knee slipped out of

place.‘ She too will be lost for two to
three weeks.

Lisa Stewart and Sue Hoover
have also missed significant practice
time with injuries. Both are expected
to be ready for this week’s opener.

Although" the Panthers will be
counting on their highly recruited
freshmen to make a significant con-
tribution throughout the season,
Collier feels that his returning vete-
rans must take control. “People like
Judy Young, Sue Hoover, Kris
Wexell, and Sally Gillespie are really
going to have to turn it on for us to
be a good team and I think they are
getting comfortable to do that,” he
said. O

The Lady Panthers are comforta-
ble being ranked 18th in the country.
Now they must prove that they are
worthy of recognition. “I think that
when we put on the official game
uniforms, and we put our national
ranking on the line this weekend,
everyone will respond real well and
play real well,” said Collier.
