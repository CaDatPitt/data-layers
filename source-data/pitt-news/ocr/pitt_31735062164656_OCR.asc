YMCA ;“YWCA Begin Service for    

Blind College Students at Univer.

Despite advancement in
aids for the blind, many bas-
ic reading materials for
blind students are not yet
availablein Braille. The lack
of Braille materials can be-
come‘ a crucial problem to
the blind college student. To
help alleviate this problem
at the University, the University
chapter of the YMCA-YWCA es-
tablished a Reader Service this
winter. -

Sighted students volunteer to
do reading to blind students for
two hour periods several times
during the week. The Y office
then assigns the readers to the
one of the eight blind students
participating in the program.

The Reader Service was the

‘idea of two University students,

Jim Spruell and Lucy Correnti.
They asked Frank Watanabe and
Mrs. Waldine Vivrett, executive
directors of the University chap-
ters of the YMCA and the YWCA,
respectively, to help coordinate
the project. Mr. Watanabe and
Mrs. Vivrett now serve as_ advi-
sors to the Reader Service.

serve as readers. Thirty of the
readers are members of Zeta Beta
Tau (ZBT) fraternity, which vol-
unteered to the reading as a
group social service project. The
readers from ZBT work on a
rotating basis; diﬁerent brothers

serve as readers from week to.

week.

Mr. Watanabe said, “I com-
mend Zeta Beta Tau for their en-
thusiastic support as part of their
national social service project. I
further hope that ZBT’s role in
this project will inﬂuence other
fraternities and sororities to par-
ticipate in similar projects for
fellow students Or for needs faced
by members of the community.
ZBT’s participation helped to es-
tablish a concrete example of
involvement and commitment in
such a project.’

Referring to Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil’s and Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil’s contribution of a tape re-
corder to help the Reader Service
start a tape library for blind
students, Mr. Watanabe com-

New Dean Enjoys Student Contacts

V By JAY GLASSER
“Some of my most re-

T ' ‘been my contacts with stu-

Hoelscher, new dean of the
Schools of Engineering and

' - Mines.

The new engineering dean
is presently chairman of the
Chemical Engineering Department
at Johns Hopkins University and
will assume his new post here
July 1. He will replace Acting

j .Dean Walter Turkes, professor
, and chairman of the Department

L of Industrial Engineering.

(Collegiate Press Service)

The Student Nonviolent
‘Cloordinating Committee
(SNCC) is planning to re-
cruit 2,000 students for lob-
bying in Washington, D.C.
this summer. ’
- Beginning about the middle of

June, the students will be ex-
pected_ to spend several weeks

i A “constantly lobbying” for the un-

seating of the ﬁve Congressmen
from Mississippi. SNCC will at-
tempt to recruit students for the

 project from all over the coun-

try v“but especially from north-
ern areas where the Congress-

men will be politically respon-

“Operation Challenge” is also
designed to gain support for “one

Dr. Hoelscher, who is well-
known for his contributions to
the changing needs of engineer-
ing education, considers himself
primarily a teacher and plans to
teach at least one undergraduate
and graduate course each trimes-
ter. He has published widely in
technical and professional jour-
nals on his work in heat and
mass transfer and reactor dy-
namics and intends to continue
doing research at the University.
Dr. Hoelscher expressed his in-
terest in the students and is look-
ing forward to meeting and work-
ing with them. He feels that a-ll
students beneﬁt from the bring-
ing together of people from dif-
ferent areas, since we live in total
world and all students bring
something with them.

The new (‘dean was impressed
by the size of the Schools of En-

gineering and Mines. He feels
that the University’s position in
education is strong and we must
work to strengthen that position.
“We must crystalize our goals for
engineering on the local and na-
tional scene and then be best in
that.” »

He considers the new engineer-
ing complex “most exciting,” and
feels that it ‘will have a large
effect on engineering at the Uni-
versity just by its existence. By
drawing all of the engineering
disciplines together under one
roof will be increased interplay
among them. Dr. Hoelscher said,
“I look forward with great pleas-
ure to the exciting years to come.
We can serve our area and na-
tion best by bringing the results
of research to bear on engineer-

ing problems in new and excit-

ing ways.”

Pitt News Reviews:

Heinz Chapel Choir

by BILL SMITH -

Last Thursday evening the Heinz Chapel Choir charm-
ed and delighted a small but appreciative audience in the
Ball Room of the Student Union. The program was a varied
one ranging from a lovely and contemplative ‘German folk
song to a dynamic religious Work.

The concert began with “Hodie Christus Natus Est” by
Sweelinck and it was apparent from the start that the even-
was to be a good one. The balance between the four sections
was excellent and only occasionally throughout the concert

was this not the case.

In “Once Through A -Woodland
Mary Walked” Dr. Donald Col-
ton, the choir’s competent direc-
tor, displayed his good musical
taste. The theme, often sung by
the tenor or alto section, is em-
broidered with runs and counter-
points. But always the theme and
embellihments c am e through
clealry and the audience was
able to hear and comprehend
what was important and what
was helping to make it impor-
tant.

There was some especially nice
two part singing in th-is number,
which for my money, was one of
the highlights of the concert.

The Byrd madrigal “I Will Not
Leave You Comfortless” went
fairly well but the choir exper-
ienced the most difficulty here.
Entrances are tricky and not all
were masteerd with the same
kind of precision apparent in
most of the other pieces.

The Brahms’ “Our Savior
Throw The Heavens Wide” was
one of the most harmonically dif-
ficult numbers the choir sang.
They were more than up to it.
Augmented chords, suspensions,
frequent modulations. and chro-
matic progressions were all in
abundance, and here again Dr.
Colton’s musical sense must be
applauded.

In the Brahms’ piece it is ab-
solutely necessary that the bass
section provide a firm foundation
for the harmonic structure. Dr.
Colton brought the bases out a
little more and the effect of the
clash-ing dissonances resolving to
more consonant sounds was
achieved admirably.

It .seems appropriate to men-
tion here not only the excellent
sound the choir projected but al-
so the musically sensitive con-
ducting of Dr. Colton. He knew
what kind of sound he wanted
and went through the minimum

of motions to get it. His hands
did most of his “talking” and
when he pointed "a finger at a
particular person or section that
person or section responded.

His motions were subtle and
calculated. He was the picture of
lightness and weightlessness when
he wanted to portray the sustain-
ing quality needed in some of
the numbers. Yet, he was also
decisive when the music demand-
ed technically difficult runs.

Should one argue with success?
I will dare one observation. Per-
haps Dr. Colton’s movements
could have been more precise

. and specific, or at least broader

and more visible for the choir,
in those especially difficult en-
trances and rhythmic passages.

Two works stand out as high-
lights of the second part of the
second part of the program. In
“Psalm 100 ‘The Echo’ ” a solo
quartet, placed in the middle of
the choir, alternated with the
choir in singing the same phrases
in overlapping as well as echo
style. The quartet blended well
and the smiles of the audience
and the hearty applause that fol-
lowed told the rest of that par-
icular story.

In “Heaven Above”, a Nor-
wegian folk song, the audience
was treated to the resonant and

'\

WHAT BETTER way to solve the University's bud-
get problems than to advertise cleansers on the
Towers Dormitories? Actually, the gag in the pic-
ture on the right was made by an imaginative

 

photographer and retoucher from B. T. Babbitt,

Ajax, Bab-0 and Comet. The only ﬂaw of this

ers Ink, was the misplacing of Ajax with Bab-0.

highly pleasing voice of James
Craford. He evidenced a sureness
of tone and an evenness in range
that would provoke envy in most
singers. _

The last part of the program
was devoted to relatively con-
temporary music. The Debussy
numbered went nicely although
the inner voices were occasional-
ly lost. The Kodaly pieces were
delightful and in the Hindemith
works the choir showed it was
not afraid to hold on to dis-

, snances that did not resolve so

pleasantly.

The official program ended
with “Lord Hosanna” by Schreck.
It is a moving piece that built
in volume until the final resound-
ing fortissimo was reached.

The one encore the choir did
was a Spanish carol that was
pure fun and froth.

Formed on Univ. Campus

By RUTH LEVIKOFF
Students for Peace and
PLUS (Pitt Liberal Union of
Students), two new organi-
zations on campus, were
formed “to dissipate the

apathetic atmosphere that
prevailed at the University
and replace it with an ener-
getic awareness,” according
to the leaders of the groups.

“There has been an emergence
on campus of a ‘new student left
movement,’ dedicated to eﬁecting
changes in the University and in
the general society,” said Rick
Shweder, member of PLUS. Evi-
dence of this movement is the
formation of Students for Peace
and the increased Civil Rights
activity.

PLUS was designed to central-
ize and coordinate liberal left
activities. The group wants 'to
make the students aware of sit-
uations existing outside as well
as inside the University cell,
which demand changes. It fo-
cuses on the social and political
issues of poverty, discrimination,
warfare in Vietnam, and exploi-
tation of the ‘‘college — student
class.”"PLU_S emphasizes the stu-
dent's role as an important in-
ﬂuence in these aifairs.

“Our main weapon, as mem-
bers of PLUS, is publicity,”
Shweder commented. “Though I
speak of ‘our,’ ‘we,’ and a. ‘move-
ment,’ we don't all agree among
ousclves,” Shweder continued.
PLUS hopes to eﬂect, through
open meetings and discussions, a
forum where issues will be
brought for debate. The froum
idea with the plan to print a
journal will enable both the ma-
jority and the various minority
views to be expressed.

The ﬁrst project completed by
PLUS was the sale of Christmas

Annual Banquet

The William Pitt Debate Union
will hold its Aimual Forensic
Banquet tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.
in the Student Union Supper
Room. Debaters, friends of WPDU,
and representatives of the Ad-
ministration will attend the af-
fair.
Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice-chan-
cellor in charge of student af-
fairs, will deliver the main ad-
dress.

Master of Ceremonies and the
present WPDU president, Wolf-
ram W. Swoboda, will introduce

I the incoming president, David L.

nounce the officers on next year’s

Awards will be given to the
outstanding debaters of the year,

cards. Proﬁts, close to 300 dol-
lars, were contributed to Con-
gress of Federated Organizations.
The Students for Peace, a paci-
ﬁst group, acting as .an informa-
tion center, hopes to emphasize
the importance of seeking non-
violent solutions in both interna-
tional and domestic crimes. The
organization grew out of the de-
sire of several University paci-
ﬁsts, to present students normal-
ly opposed to war with an alter-
native to “ROTC Now or Draft
Later.” _
The leaders of the group, Paul

Tinker, said that if their organ-
ization is given office space in
the Student Union, they will set
up a library which will have
reading material reﬂecting the
various policies within the peace
movement.

“now

  

.The Athletic Department’s budget has been cut for the
Coming season. We must make very sizeable overall reduc-
tions, said Athletic Director Frank Carver. The reduction
includes “across the line” cuts in all areas of all sports.

_ “W979 Still Working 130 try 130 get down across the line,”
said Carver, “but all coaches have been notiﬁed as far as
next year, and almost in every case there is a reduction.”

ALTHOUGH CARVER gave no speciﬁcs, he indicated
cuts are not exclusively in aid, but include travel expendi-
tures, equipment expenses, and all aspects of the sports. N o
coach has given any indication of how sizable the reductions
may be. ‘ ~

However, soccer coach Leo Bemis said during the sea-
son thathe would lose the equivalent of one full scholarship

though he has already re-
cruited two freshmen, the
cut hinders the current team.

Several studentslon the
team were working towards
half or full aid this season,
but the cut creates the usual
ﬁeld house phenomena of in-
decision and uncertainty.

Confidence On and Off Track

By RON SHEARER

Luddy Hayden wants to
“git on the books.” Contrary
to the statement’s implica-
tions, Hayden does not have
to improve his grades to re-
main on the track team. He
now boasts a 3.11 average
and is conﬁdent of maintain-
ing it in his senior year.

“Git on the books” means one
thing to Hayden — reputation.
“When you have the name, man,

- then you are the top cat where-

ever you perform,” he said. “It’s
hard to attain, but once you win
that big event or run an excep-
tional time, you have it made.”

“Just entering an event puts
the other performers at a dis-
advantage,” continued Hayden,
“because they respect you and
your ability. It’s that psycholog-
ical advantage that’s so impor-
tant in this sport.”

Hayden is a hurdler and broad-
jumper from Baltimore. He grad-
uated from_ an all boys high
school, and was the first track
man in the school’s history to
win both sport awards given:
the Saperstein award and the
Hall of Fame award.

He almost went to Villanova,
but rejected that "opportunity
when he learned that part of the
scholarship stipulated ‘that he
run deﬁnite times to retain the
aid.

Larry Robinson, who graduated
from the same high school, was
a runner’ here when Hayden.
graduated and sold him on the
University. _’ _ b .

As a track man, Hayden con‘-
tinues to star. “WhenlI get on the
track, I am going full speed all
the time. If I lose an event, I
know that someone beat me, I
,didn’t defeat myself. As long as
I can say I did my best I am
satisﬁed.”

Hayden also has some ideas on
coaching and strategy. “When we
go into a meet, the thinking is
that we will concede so many
points in this or that event and
make them up in some other
event.event. Me, I don’t want to
concede anyone anything. _I go out
there expecting to win every
event.”

Coach Carl Rees calls Hayden
a class runner. “When a fellow is
as consistent and versatile as
Luddy, then he falls into that

in pit for sixth place at IC4As.

top category,” said Rees. “With-
out even practicing, he went

. against the best broadjumpers in

the eastern part of the country
in the IC4AS and ﬁnished sixth.’
I think that is fantastic.”

Hayden has an interesting
method of preparing himself psy-
chologically for a. meet. He sets
a certain time or distance in
each event he thinks he will win.
When he has reached that goal
in a meet he sets another one and
is conﬁdent he. can reach it on
any given day..

Something equally as impor-
tant to Hayden’s preparation is
the thought of facing his friends.
“This year, there has been more
interest shown in the track squad

-than in the past,” he said. “Peo-

ple are concerned about how we

‘do individually and teamwise in

our meets. It hurts me to report

with an alibi, or just to know
that by ﬁnishing second, some-
one is going to be disappointed.
It’s a great aid to push me to a
better showing.”

Hayden walks lazily and talks
speedily.‘ He becomes a. polished
linquist when speaking about
track, Pitt, or personal satisfac-
tion. He ﬂares his hands in the
air while talking, and he often
seems to be doing a wild dance.

Hayden wants to be a lawyer.
And, he wouldn’t mind replac-
ing his dungarees with button-
down collars and ivy covered
walls in a certain Connecticutt
community. In the meantime, he
is gaining valuable experience as
a Student Government Senator,
as a member of Alpha Phi Alpa
social fraternity, and .as a mem-
ber of several honorary organi-
zations.

Coach Ben Pope Foresees Another Poor
Tennis Season as Team Goes Outdoors

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Outdoors for the ﬁrst time, the
tennis team practiced Wednesday
in preparation for their April 24
opening against Kent State. “The
weather,of course, held us up,”
said coach Ben Pope, “and now
with tests coming up, our pr.ac-
tice time will be cut short even
more.

“The team is almost as strong
as last year's,” Pope continued.
“Unfortunately, last year’s team
won one match all season.” The
current squad has three letter-
men returning. Sam Donatell/i,
heads the group, and ‘‘he’ll be
playing in the number one slot
for us,” said Pope. Tom Barber
and Lan'y O’Loughlin are the
other two players with varsity
experience.

Tennis is handicapped here by‘
the lack of home courts.. The
team practices at Arsenal Park,
but the players had tobring their

 netsk; ’ I

 

    

Transporation proves to be an-

‘other handicap. “Last year we

had six cars to get us out to the
courts for practice,” Pope said.
“But this year only two cars are
available—Donatel1i’s and mine.”

“Since ahnost everyone at prac-
tice was new, we played elim-
ination matches to establish some
kind of rating,” said Pope. “It
will take us a dozen or so pras-
tice sessions to! get in stride.”

Pope, as usual, doesn’t envision
a successful season. “It will be
tough this year, but there's little
that can be done about it,” he
admitted. “The new EEAC rul-
ing doesn’t make much difference
as far as I’m concerned. A boy
from out of town can play for
us and not go to school, but most
of the time he won’t stick around.
He’1l want to go home, and the
Pittsburgh boys going to school

I have the time needed to play

for the team.’_’ _ _

pite a relatively easy schedule. .

“We don’t play a powerhouse
like Navy or any of the other big
timers, which is good. Although
Penn State is tough most of the
other schools are local.”

Playing Kent State away in the
opener provides an early prob-
lem. “They have a good setup
there," said Pope. “I will be sur-
prised if we could knock them
off. In spite of the uncompro-
mising weather and ﬁnals com-
ing up, we’ll be ready for Kent.
We have to be.”

In addition to Kent State, the
early portion of the schedule in-
cludes California State on April
27 (A), Bethany (A) on the 28th,
and Indiana State (A) on May 1.
West Virginia plays the team in
an important home and home

Girls Intramural Swim Squad
Ties Slippery Rock in Meet

Women’s intramural athletics
had a limited schedule this year
due to lack of participation. One
team that competed suscessfully
was the newly formed swimming
squad coached by Miss Leith
Drebelbis.

In their only meet on March
20 at the Trees Pool, Pitt faced
Duquesne, Carnegie Tech, Slip-
pery Rock, and Point Park. The
girls won the ﬁnal event, the 200

‘ Claims irector
Intramurals this season has shown deﬁnite improve-
ment according to intramural director Leo Bemis’ “Forward
strides were made in dorm house participation and stabil-
ity,” said Bemis. Since the beginning ofthe trimester sys-
tem and the new dormitories, intramurals has declined. But
now it sees to be gaining strength again.

One first was the dual frater-
nity swimming meets and the
dorm swim meet,” said Bemis.
“With the new Trees pool swim-
ming is now a regular part of
the schedule.”

The outlook for the Fall is also
good, because of the new physi-
cal education buildings. “With
better facilities, there will be
greater participation ind inter-
est,” said Bemis. “We can also de-
velop open, individual competi-
tion in such sports as handball,
badminton, and paddleball.”
One other important factor ac-
cording to Bemis is that students
are now better prepared aca-
demically to cope with the tri-
mester system, and they will
have more time to spent at in-
tramurals.

The program for the upcoming
spring trimester will be limited
since there are fewer students.
Double round-robin softball is
scheduled to start the ﬁrst week
in May and will continue until
the third week in July. Badmin-
ton and indoor tennis are also

i planned.

The ﬁnal intramural standing

for this season produced few

changes. In Fraternity “A"

League, Delta Tau Delta re-

ceived enough bonus points to

edge Pi Lambda Phi for sesond

place. Phi Epsilon Pi remained in
the top spot.

‘In Fraternity "B" play, Pi
Kappa Alpha ﬁnished ﬁrst, while
Phi Gamma Delta was runner-up.
In Dormitory standings, Haw-

thorne was the winner and Ran-
dom placed second.

Despite inexperience,
freshmen ends will play
much varsity football this
season.
“At least three or four
freshmen are going to play
"football next Fall,” said end
coach Ernie Hefferle.“(Bo_b)
Longo and (George) Hawry-
iuk are top receivers on the fresh
and will be used as open ends.
Because of their size and ability,
(Dick) Miale and (Greg) Keller
._.will make better tight ends.”

Last year’s team lacked depth
and ability at the end position,
' but Helferle expects a healthier
situation this season. “Last year
we were limited in numbers,” he
iaid, “but this season there are
ﬁve and six boys battling for
“ each spot. This depth should re-
sult in better end play by the
players.”

a crop as anyone will ever see, ’
continued Hefferle. “They have
fairly good size, they're strong,
they have just the proper temper-
ament. This school is going to
hear from them before they
leave.”

Although the frosh looked good
in the first couple scrimmages,
Heﬁerle said the probable start-
ing offensive ends are Mitch Zal-
nasky and Mike Rosborough.

Another end, John Verkleeren,
is still recovering from his op-
eration and won’t be able to go
full time. “He won’t get into any
hitting practice yet because he
is too valuable to risk,” said Hef-
ferle.

“With the new two-platoon sys-
tem, all of the ends areassigned
one position, either as a tight
end or an open end. They retain
this position whether they line
up on the left side or the right
side. The players learn one as-

“Football Team’s Schedule
i<Announced For 1965-66 

y _ _ The football team begins. its ten game schedule on Sep- ,_

basketball and wrestling schedules, the gridders play a’ ba.1- I

 . After the opener, the team plays Oklahoma here the

signment, concentr'ate,_on it, and

thus do better,” said He-ﬂ"erle.
During ‘the Spring practices,
the players get key evaluation.
“We must ﬁnd out who will be
the specialists and who can go
two ways,” Hefferle said. “After
each practice and after each
scrimmage, we learn a little bit
more about the younger kids.”
“Once the position of a player
and his possibilities are deter-
mned, he is placed on one of
four teams.
team that goes two ways, then
the specialists squads, defense
and offense. The fourth group

\ also goes two ways and is usual-

ly used if somebody gets hurt,”
said Heﬁerle.

Hefferle compared the current
team with the 1963 team that
compiled a 9-1 record. “The rea-
son for the success that year,”
he said, “was that everybody
stayed healthy. There was stiffer
competition and everyone want-

There is the ﬁrst ‘

  

led to play. V
“They practiced harder and

longer; they shaped up so they

could play. This year, the same
situation exists with“ the fresh-
men ﬁghting the varsity for
starting berths,” continued Hef-
ferle.

Another factor which Hefferle
thinks will aid the team this sea-
son is the ‘‘double’’ purpose of

the “I” formation.“‘Since'we play

opponents who use the ‘I,’ our
defense can get a look at it in
practice long before the week of
the game. Through recognition
of the plays, the defense can do
better against the ‘I,”' he said

“We introduced this as an of-
fensive weapon but its two—fo1d
purpose beneﬁts the entire‘ team,”
continued Hei-ferle.

After less than a week
outdoor practice, the base-
ball team opens its season
with a ﬁve game away series
beginning April 19. Poor
weather conditions have
forced the team to practice in-
doors ‘during the past month.

The mitters play .at George
Washington in the opener, and
next play two games at Norfolk,
one at Fort Lee, and end the
southern tour at Georgetown.
George Washington has 13 games
scheduled before their game with
the Panthers, while Georgetown
plays eight games.

This early tour aids coach Bob-
by Lewis in determining which
of the 30 prospective players he
will cut. Lewis can only take 22
on the trip, and must cut the
squad to 20 for the season.

“This is where the decisions
get rough,” said Lewis. “Most of
these fellows are just about
equal. It’s nearly a toss up, and
I can’t make a. decision until I’ve
seen them play under real con-
ditions.”

Last week, two intra - squad
games were played. “They didn’t
look too bad," said Lewis. “The
pitchers had a little edge over
the hitters, but I think this was
only due to the shift in batting

conditions. You have mixed emo-
tions when your pitchers contain
your own hitters. You don’t know
whether your pitchers are good
or your hitters bad.”

Among those competing for a
spot on the pitching staff are
three boys with partial scholar-
ships — Don Stock, Paul Helsel
and Carmen Bordogna. Frank
Monaco, a transfer from Johns-
town, has also pitched well.

Three spots are also open in
the outﬁeld with Ferd Sauer, Bill
Bodle, Warren. Sordill, George
Mussoff, Jack Cullen and Tom
Stickell among the hopefuls.

-The biggest openings have been
.at shortstop and third base,
where seven candidates are vy-
ing for a starting position.

.“George Washington and
Georgetown will get quite a jump‘
on us,” said Lewis, "‘because
they’re not inconvenienced by the
set-up of their semester system.
Practice during ﬁnals will be
erratic for us. The boys will come
up and work out on their own
when they have time. And that’ll
probably be the week we have
sun.”

The mitters’ home opener is on

April 24, when they‘ play Syra-’

cuse in a doubleheader at Forbes
Field. Following home games in-

clude a single game against In-_

Draft Replacement

(Collegiate Press Service)

Senator Gaylord Nelson,

Wisconsin Democrat, has dis-

closed that he Will introduce a Concurrent Resolution ex-
pressing the view of Congress that the draft should be re-
placed by a voluntary system if national security could be

maintained.

He also said that his conclusion that the draft can be
safely ended has been conﬁrmed by representative of the
Department of Defense who have told him that the main

question is not any danger to
the nation but simply the cost
of added incentives for enlist-
ment.

In a speech before a meeting
of representatives of religious,
farm, labor, and voter groups,
called by the National Council of
Churches, Nelson said his reso-
lution would give the public and
Congress a -voice in the impend-
ing decision on the draft.

Nelson’s resolution will be the
boldest Congressional action thus
far in the movement to replace
the present Selective Service Sys-
tem with a voluntary plan to fill
military manpower and require-
ments. -

Last year Senator Kenneth
Keating (Republican, New York),
who has since been defeated, pro-
posed a presidential commission
tostudy the problem in depth. The
idea however, was spurned in
favor of an expansion of the De-
partment of Defense's already

A existing study of military man-
power. ’

Nelson himself introduced a
bill in June, 1964, which would
have directed the Secretary of
Defense to present alternatives
to the draft to Congress by 1967.
His new resolution will be phrased
to invite support from senators

, who might have some doubt that
manpower requirements could be
fulfilled without the draft but
who would like a voluntary sys-

, tern if enough enlistees can be
attracted with new incentives.

The Senator is known to feel
that conservative thinking in the
.;-. military and cost-consciousness in
%“4 Congress may be obstacles to a
it ' recommendation that ‘the draft

a be ended, and that a Congres-
sional vote of confidence for its
elimination would strengthen the
hand of those in the Executive
who agree with him. ’

 

He ‘is now beginning to collect
co-sponsors for the resolution,
which may come before the Sen-
ate within the next month.
