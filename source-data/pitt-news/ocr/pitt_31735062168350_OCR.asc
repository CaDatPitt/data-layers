Environmental Forum
Draws Pitt Students

by non BONN

Three University students at-
tended the National Environmen-
tal Action Conference at Black"
Lake, Michigan, on July 17-19.

Representatives from Pitt's
Environmental Action branch

were Marc Hiller, Brady Moore A

III, and Margorie Lubet. The
meeting was held at the Family

' Education center of the United‘

Auto Workers and was the first
_national meeting on pollution to

be completely supported by’ lab-

01'.

Among the many topics dis-
cussed in workshops were En-
vironmental Research, Legal Ac-
tion, - Environmental ‘Action in
Urban Poor Communities, and
Ecology and the Pentagon.

Ideas developed at the con-
ference which will be imple-
mented locally are three-fold.

, First, in an effort to drama-
tically point out to the public the
effects of ' the internal combus-
tion engine, one of the most hea-
vily-travelled streets in Pitts-

burgh will be closed for a day in
the fall.

This will create a "pollution-
free zone.” the Plan, supported
by mayor Peter Flaherty, names
Fifth Avenue as the probable
street.

Secondly, students’ in the law
‘schools of Pitt and Duquesne
will join forces to research and
prosecute violators of anti-pollu-
tion laws. They will be known
as the Pittsburgh Environmental
‘Law Society.

Finally, a state-wide confer-
ence on pollution will be held in
-either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia
in late November. Members of
any group ‘concerned with the
pollution problem will be urged
to attend.

In other business at the Nation-

al conference, University Envir-
onmental Action coordinator

Marc Hiller was asked to coor-

dinate all Environmental Action

' groups in the state of Pennsyl-

vania. The request came from
national leader Denis Hayes.

Salper Bowing Out

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Roberta Salper is leaving the
University for a more “progres-
sive" school.

The Assistant dean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
will be “demoted“ to Disting-
uished Visiting Assistant Profes-
sor at San Diego State.

The West Coast University is
one of the first in the nation to
institute a comprehensive pro-

gram in Women's Studies. Dr.

Salper has been invited to lead
three courses in the ten course
program.

The offer from California com-
es in the wake of a series of oth-
ers recently forwarded to the
only major woman administrator
at the University. One of them
was a -Vice-Chancellery at Wes-
leyan, a college newly going
"'coed". .

Roberta Salper, however, has
been fighting tokenism since she
became active in the Womenls
Liberation movement several

"Catch 22” Transcends Anti-war

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Catch 22 was one of the most
anticipated films of recent years.
It was generally expected to be

 the be the bejewelled crown of

‘the anti-war trend that has en-
Joyed so‘ much popularity of late.

It is that, but only parenthe-
tically. Mike Nichols’ film tran-
scends the anti-war message,
emerging as a masterfully stated,
grotesquely funny » testimony
against death.

. The backdrop, as it was in Jo-

seph Heller’s novel, is an Ameri-
can Air Force Base in the Ital-
ian theatre of World War Two.
Nichols ‘lets us know beyond a
doubt that the war rages, that it
is. responsible for much of the
carnage. Yet little of the slaugh-
ter is precipitated by Germans or

, Italians or Japanese.

Death is the enemy. Death, .

ably abetted by ‘bureaucratic .stu-
pidity, avarice and chance plaug-
es the unit. Accidental, as when
a- pilot performing stunts for a
photographer severs the photog-
rapher in two. Intentional, as
when that same horror-stricken
pilot runs his plane into a moun-
V And unbelievable, as
when the profiteering Lieute-
nant Milo Minderbinder has his

- own base bombed and strafed to

‘complete a deal with the Ger-

Nichols further broadens the
anti-war theme by remaining
faithful to Heller’s technique
or shattering the boundaries of
’ time and space. The film leaps
frenetically through the present

._ and past, from the base to var-

ious, Italian -locals, so that it
-Wibecomes impossible to pin the
_ "action and ._its consequences to
 ;~ » any specific .situation.

JUXTAPOSITION S

Nichols achieves his effects
through the use of harsh, often
stark juxtapositions. Jon Voigt
as Minderbinder confers with
Colonel Cathcart (Martin Bal-
sam) about egg prices while a
plane crashes and ignites before
them. The gentle Chaplain (An-
thony Perkins) comes to speak
to the Colonel about the morale
of the men and finds him in the
corner. deficating. Yossarian (Al-
an Arkin) amorously pursues an
' Italian beauty but finds his path
blocked by pompous military vic-
tory parade down the pillaged
Italian streets.

Focal point of the war against
death is Yossarian. Arkin does
more than portray the, unhappy
'" Captain; he is Yossarian. He is
simultaneously outraged at the
senseless massacre and fearful
that he will.be the next to die.
“They're all out to get me,” Ar-

 

Yossarian (Arkin) ponders death.

 

just know that it’s more than
simple paranoia.

The-rest of the cast falls short
of Arkin’s excellence, though
they would ‘almost have to Or-
son Welles does his best to bite
into a bit part and exhibits hea-
vy-handedness. Voigt is uncon-
vincing as the black market king.
Perkins, however, is properly
naive as the well-intended but
shy Chaplain.

The continuityiof the film also

suffers because of the time-space
jumps. Anyone who ‘had not
read the book might be confused
by the antics of the now-I’m-
dead-now-I’m living often name-
less men.

Catch 22 rises above its flaws.
Yossarian, though in despair’s
clutches, needs onlythe faintest
spark of hope to awaken his‘ in-
satiable appetite for life. Catch

22, though presenting a tabloidof

death, never lets us ‘ view it

years ago and that’s how she in-
terpreted the move.

“It might sound like a step
down.” she explained concern-
ing the San Diego offer, “But
that’s not really true. I want to
be where_the action is. This Uni-
versity (Pittsburgh) has really

made no progress for women out-‘

side of tokenism.”

Roberta’s move out West is
based on professional, personal
and philosophical grounds. Im-
portantly, she laments that her
name has become synonomous
with Women‘s Liberation.

“A movement can never be
one person," she believed. “I
felt that my effectiveness in
Pittsburgh was about done.”

But she added that she plans
to return if the progression of
the Liberation movement war-

rants it. i - ‘

  Welsh Group _ Visits.

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Thirty—six students from Bang-
or, Wales are currently guests of
this University and the city of
Pittsburgh. The tour is sponsored
by the University of Northern
Wales.

Alun Lewellyn-Williams, lead-
er of the group, explained that
the purpose of the program is
"to take the university outside
the walls. “In Bangor," he as-
serted, the university is for any
one who wishes to attend.

The spokesman described the
_educational system in Wales as
“informal.” There are no exams,
credits, or grades, “but educa-
tion for its own sake.”

The students are taking a
course at Pitt in American His-
to_ry. The course focuses on trade
unions, ghetto life, and American
politics. Mr. Lewellyn-Williams
reports that the group finds the
course “very enjoyable."

The students, who arrived in
Pittsburgh five days ago, will re-
main here until August 8. Thus
far they have visited Mt. Wash-
ington, ‘and, in the time remain-
ing, will “see H. J. Heinz, WQED,
and Three Rivers Stadium. '

Margaret Thomas, seemed fas-
cinated with American domes-
tic life. Miss Olwen Jones, agree-

“But Some Won’t Make It Back”

By BOB GING
News Editor

The end of July. the hot. humid days when
even the flies are too tired to bother anyone. has
always had a home stretch quality about it. be-
cause I know that the beginning of school is not
nearly so far away as it has looked ‘since April.
Many students are glad to be coming back to
school in less than a month. but there are many
who were looking forward to it who won‘t be
back.

With tuition up seventy dollars a term. after
a jobless summer like the one we have just
come through. many students who attended or
who hoped to attend the University Will be un-
able to.

It puzzles me how the University can justify
an almost 100 per cent increase in tuition over
the last three years. We are continually bom-
barded by the fact that the costs of running the
University are higher each year. and there is
also the problem that the state legislature has an
annual habit of turning down our full requested

appropriation. but it is hard to imagine the need
for a four hundred dollar tuition raise between
1967 and 1970.

Another area where "our unresponsive to stu-
dents” University is continually falling behind is
financial aid. Why is it that the Yale alumnae
raised a record amount of money this year. when
our University can barely stand on its feet‘? It
is no wonder that the Board of Trustees. who are
responsible for raising money for the University.
have in the past refused to open meetings and re-
cords to the students.

If the administration is having so much trou-
ble balancing their budget maybe it would be
wise if they would enlist the aid of students in
the Graduate School of Business to give them a
hand. If there is a problem with the legislature.
perhaps it would be advisable to enlist the aid of
all the students to pressure the legislature.

As the summer nears its end. though. it seems
that all those of us who are coming back have to
look forward tolis a tuition increase. and another
year of administrative bushbeating.

The Back Door

A White Cahby Vs. The Ghetto

by EVAN PATTAK
FEATURE EDITOR

I read the editorial on the dif-
ficulties blacks have getting cabs
with great interest. You stated
that jitneys were necessary. since
cab drivers didn't venture into
the ghetto areas. As a cab driver.
however. let me say that though
your conclusion is correct. your
reasoning is but semi—sound. Per-
haps I can best make my point_
by relating a personal exper-

- ience.

Tuesday. I drove a woman from
Montefiore Hospital to Wylie
Ave. in the Hill. As I was writ-
ing up the fare. three young
blacks approached the cab and
asked if I was free.

I remember my boast that I
had never turned down a fare.

and also felt the prick of your
editorial. "Sure." I said. "hop
in.“

As we cruised along. I felt

reassured that the world would
not end in black white armaged-
don. I felt, even by only main-
taining equality in my cab. I
would be doing a little right
hundreds of years of repression.
I wanted to grab the hand of the
guy in the front seat, and in so
doing. bridge the racial gap.
. . . . . Except that his hand was
already occupied . . . . . by a
gun. which was trained. more
or less. on my left ventricle. (Als
my favorite chamber.)

These things happen.

I wrote this not to make any
sweeping generalizations about
blacks or crime. that blacks

have been exploited by whites
for years, that cab drivers might
be seen as symbols of that ex-
ploitation is. to most cabbies. be-
yond the point. The simple_ fact
that neither of us wishes to ad-
mit ‘is that cab drivers ‘run a
greater risk of robbery in the
ghettos.

ti?

It is true that some drivers are .

bigots. You are undoubtedly cor-
rect in decrying the racial pre-
judice that prevents blacks from
getting cabs. But you might also
consider the tenor of the times.
Whites, whatever their intent,
are seldom welcome in the ghet-
to.

Though some cabbies avoid the
ghettos from hate. most who
skirt the black enclaves are aware
that they are not wanted.

The Draft Dodgers rolled—up
victory number 15 (without a
single defeat) when they down-
ed the Charlie Browns. 5-2. in
Mondays first of a best—of-three
intramural softball championship
playoff.

Even though Draft Dodger
pitcher Charley Gibbs pitched to
the Browns as though they had
been clad in Goodwill uniforms.
the Dodgers‘ tight fielding check-
ed the Browns to only two tall-
ies. Gibbs, meanwhile, gave out
nine walks during the 7 inning
contest. I

Gibbs‘ erratic tosses intensi-
fied the pressure so greatly that
Dodger captain Ellis Hatch could
take no more of it. After Giibbs
loaded the bases with one out
in the bottom of the sixth, Jack
Dillon vacated his third base
post for the tense mound duties.

Browns’ final five batters, but
he also socked the contest’s sole
home run.

“Even though the Charlie

we had confidence in winning.
The opposition usually doesn‘t
score many runs against us. and
we feel that when we get a two
run lead that we're in good
shape." Dodger catcher Bob
Volkmann remarked.

After the Browns opened with
a first inning run. the Dodgers
took advantage of an error to
jump into the lead. In the top of
the second inning, Volkmann
and John Greedon singled be-
fore second baseman Ed Jozwiak
stepped to the plate.

Jozwiak pounded the ball to
the right of Browns’ captain and
first baseman Art Park. As he
picked-up the ball and raced to-
ward first base, the ball dropped
from his glove. When he look-
ed up, he noticed Volkmann—the

tying run—running for the plate. ,

In Park’s haste,’ he hurled the
ball off the light tower pole

into the tennis courts. Two runs

first year players and consisten-

over the past two seasons.

“We’ve played together for
the past few years and play real
well together. We know that our
players will show-up for each
game. W.e’re consistent and it
helps us,” Volkmann said.

..The addition of secondbase-
man Ed Jozwiak, shortstop
George Luther, and thirdbase-
man Jack Dillon along with
first base holdover Jim Mahoney
have combined to mould an in-
field worthy of being called su-
perior if not "million dollar.“

The Draft Dodgers Will get
at least one more opportunity
against the Charlie Browns to
prove their quality and consis-
tency.
