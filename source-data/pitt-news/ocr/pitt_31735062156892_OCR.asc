Pre-Registrat

Dr. J. G. Quick, University Registrar, released the complete pre-¢

said the [organization was free
with any outside organizations. ,
A slip-up somewhere prevented
Congress from considering the pe-
/tition for the proposed amendment
dealing with proportional repre-
sentation. '
The petition had not been pre-
sented to George Lynn, president
of Student Congress, until just be-
fore the-meeting, so Congress had
no time to investigate and -study it.
The lack of bulletin board space
for publicity posters was then
dealt with. »A ‘path was cleared
for a working approach to the
task when Congress resolved to
accept the invitation of Mr. Biddle
and Miss Helen P. Rush, dean of
women, to enlist a student com-
mittee for the purpose of aiding

the existing faculty committee in

registration plan for the spring semester last. week a full one and a

half months ahead of time.

Under the new scheme, the student has only two cards to ﬁll out
during the usual registration melee; the remainder of the student
writing will be done at home, library, or tuck shop, according to the

Registrar’s announcement.

Working since last, spring, Dr.
Quick, along with Assistant Reg-
istrar E. A. Batchelder, compiled
the new system with an eye to-
ward streamlining the entire pro-
cedure. Dr. Quick stated that this
system was the result of a thor-
Ough study of situations in the
past, both here, and at other cam-
puses throughout the country.”
. Plan All-Inclusive

The Registrar emphasised that
the new plan applies to regular
day students in the following
schools: The -College, School of
Business Administration, School
of Nursing, The Graduate School,
and to freshmen in the School of

-‘Engineering and Mines who were

admitted in September, 1947. Up-

tration plan will provide for (1)
early receipt by the student of a
time schedule of classes and reg-

istration cards, so that prac-
tically all of the writing may be
done before ﬁnal registration, and
(2) opportunity to procure spring
semester class cards before ﬁnal
registration, /thus avoiding the
necessity of waiting in line for
them in the sectioning division.

 vs ay to Thank

When the big gold ODK key makes its ap-
pearance beside the walk leading to the Fifth
Avenue entrance of the Cathedral 0fiLearning,
several Pitt men receive one of the highest
honors this University has to offer.

Selected annually on the basis of scholar-

ship and activities, these junior and senior men,_

when their names appear on _cards on the key,
have been tapped and accepted into Omicron
Delta Kappa, the honorary leadership frater-
nity for men.

These men deserve congratulations of the

H highest order. Theirwork has been the kind’

that makes a university more than just a c"
lection of books an”. desks.“Their activities are

the type that put heart and soul into a. school.

For this they are honored. For this we are
proud of them.

Better Than ‘Kilroy’

79

“It’s' bigger and better than ever . . .
That may sound like some carnival »barker’s
spiel or the ravingsof the advance man for
the 1948 version of the “Icecapades,” and
it may be just a little trite, but there it is and
it’s THE word on Pitt’s Cap and Gown pro-
duction which starts its run tomorrow.

Last year about this time Cap’ and Gown
jumped out of its war-time doldrums with
“Kilroy.” Student talent had to be rounded
up on the double, rehearsals had to b.e plan-
ned, a play decided upon, and the hundreds of
small details which had accumulated during the

‘war lay-off smoothed out. The organization

overcame their difficulties and the result was
a production which was well received by just
about everyone who saw it. It“wasn’t prewar
quality but it was good just the same.

Well, this year that good old pre-war ﬂavor
is deﬁnitely noticeable. THE word is that
“Mable’s Fable” is very much in keeping with»

the Cap and Gown productions which during

the thirties made the whole
want to buy tickets.

demand and be the envy of producers and con-
sumers everywhere. I

 Senior Tea A ‘Must’

_ Announcement appeared last week concern-
ing the adoption of a new plan for the Chan-
cellor’s tea. We ﬁnd that the idea of an open

‘house for seniors in the Chancellor’s office next

week comes directly from the Chancél1or’s

ofﬁce.

Dr. Fitzgerald is one of the few administra-
tors who comes near greatness. Free time, to
him, is time spent in the Tuck Shops, the Com-
mons Room or in the ﬁrst ﬂoor halls talking
over Pitt with the “insigniﬁcant” student. He
has a knack of ﬁnding out what the student
wants in the way of a University. He attempts
to adjust accordingly. '

The adoption of a senior open house” to
replace a regularly scheduled tea gives him a
chance to meet and talk with more Pitt stu-

(C

H . dents. Also, it will give the Pittt senior a chance

‘Les Gallagher . . . .

Jerry Panas.... . . . . . 

to meet Mr. Top Man of the University. Dr.
Fitzgerald regrets the fact that he is usually
unable to talk to the ordinary student enough;
next Wednesday afternoon’s open house is his
way of correcting the situation.

Rapped by Paper

_ Growing belief that American schools of ‘journalism fail
to produce capable newspapermen is causing widespread dis-
cussion in publishing and educational circles.-

Two facts, (1) that very few newspapers require a degree
in journalism from job—scekers and, (2) that some city zeditors
prefer to hire men whose academic training has been acquired
outside the schools of journalism, are stimulating progressive

praisal that would perhaps be well
for men of our institutions to fol-
low.

The primary attack on journal-
ism schools is directed at'inefﬁ-
ciency. Requiring the student to
take such courses as juvenile ﬁc-
tion writing, circulation’ manage-
ment, printing and radio continui-
ty writing, at the sacriﬁce of ne-
cessities like political science, so-
ciology, history and -economics,
makes for a narrowness and lack
of understanding that render the
journalism major incapable of fer-
reting out that which is truly of
news value.

Most city editors agree that the
actual technique of newspaper
writing can be acquired in a few
months and prefer to have their
cubs and beginners grounded in
the liberal arts instead of trained
in superﬁcial courses added to a.
curriculum merely to ﬁll out credit
hour requirements.

Two more charges are the lack
of actual newspaper experience
among faculty members and the
drawback‘ inherent in the task of
the journalism school of trying to
reduce to formula something
which is unstatic by nature.

_ All in all many great journalism
schools are left with a great
amount of self-defending to do. A

universities to a critical self-ap—9— .

possible retreat is to have prospec-
tive journalists take a liberal arts
course followed by a year of grad-
uate work in special journalism
courses. (Utah Chronicle.)

Editor, The Pitt News

A Letters To The Editor.
_WrileIj Denounces Allck
Nn News Editorial Policy  

The attitude of one Mr. Joﬁfe, whose opinion on the recent
Henry \V-allace controversy was printed in a recent “NeWS'_”. 13
so typical o-f a current tendency to undermine basic American-
ism and so lacking in the detachment necessary to evaluate
the right of a public ﬁgure to an audience, that it must be
publicly denounced and rebutted. _ _

Mr. Joifc announces that Wallace has sinned by daring to

merit. Do you mean to imply, Mr.
J affe, that our government is holy
through some divine ordainment?
Or do you believe that citizens
should no longer be allowed to
express their dissatisfaction about
anything, least of all government-
al aifairs? Mr. Joffe, in the man-

‘Iv

, ner of all bigots who substitute

epithet for reason (“reds, pinks
and punks’) has confused the mar-
velous workings of his own mind
with an absolute logic which re-
fuses the right of refutation, Henry
Wallace may be as wrong in his
‘opinions as the earth is round,
but that alone /should not justify a
denial of his right of free speech,

ﬁces in any way aifect his priv-
ilege of speaking as he sees fit.
Mr. Joife would have us believe
that a man in the position of,
say, Herbert Hoover, should be
disqualiﬁed from making any un-
favorable comment about the
workings of our national govern-
ment. If this is the gospel, Hoov-
er . will roast on Satarl’s griddle
in the company of Wallace.

There are, of course, offenses
for which freedom of speech might

‘ be justiﬁably denied. Sympathy

with the enemy during wartime;
an intention to incite riot or
civil disorder; an attempt to cre-

speak »unkindly of our govern—¢

nor should his former public of- _

ate hatred of a religious or racial
group (but even this is not a cer-
tain sign that freedom of speech
will be withhe1d—it simply is a
justiﬁcation for refusing an offer
to speak by the hate-monger); a
desire to overthrow majority rule
by force. Henry Wallace is guilty
of none of these.

And if it is true that Wallace
quotes from “Pravda”, so what?
“Pravda” is a brew of poisonous
bias, but ‘then, so is the “Chicago
Tribune”. If Colonel McMcCor-
mack were to offer to speak to
Pitt students, should his notori-
ously poor judgment bar his right
to an audience? ‘ ’ A

It should be added that Wal-
lace doesinot quote from ,“Prav-
da’,’ though it is probable that
they quote him. He has declared
that he wishes to see a halt to
Russian expansion, a statement

hardly to be found in Russian‘

newspapers. _
In this day of frenzied witch
hunting and regimentation of
thinking ,_we dare not forget a
warning to be found in an opinion
of the United States Supreme
Court written by Justice Jackson.

ion acheives only the unanimity

Student Congress has a fourteenth member.-

‘ Last Wednesday afternoon, the,Student Congress Men’s
Nominating Committee, composed of campus leaders from all
phases of activities life, named John Rozanski, senior inde-
pendent, to the vacated post on Congress.

Rozanski’s appointment was accepted by the former foot-
ball player in a phone call to his Plymouth, Pa., home follow-

ing the Cor'nmittee’s decision. . 9

Need for the nominating com-
rnittee’s action was created two
weeks prior to the choice by the
resignation of Bill Veenis, edi-
tor of the Pitt News and one of two
male elected senior representa-
tives on Congress.

.Appointment of the oratorically
minded Rozanski to Congress
marks a sharp break in previous
policy‘ of nominating committees
in that Rozanski represents an al-
together different group of campus
organizations than his predeces-

ssor. Veenis was elected to con-

. gress last spring on the fraternity

slate. and hails from the School of
Engineering, while Rozanski is an
affirmed independent from The
College. "‘ .

Board, members now will have a_
chance to become leaders them-
selves, electing their own oﬂicers
and initiating their own plans.

Annabelle Montgomery will
address the assembly on behalf of
the mentors. She will be followed
by a representative of freshmen
women who will thank the men-
tors for their guidance.

There will be an informal get-

America’: foremost authority
on young people’; problems

You spent hours making yourself out for the
big do. And you passed inspection from

~ every angle.You lined up your lines...
plotted your imprint on various hims and hers. Success
was a foregone conclusion. A

Then you made your grand entrance. Walked across the
room. And before you opened your mouth... ‘
you’d told your secret.

Everyone who watched you walk bad you doped out.
Your disposition...your persona1Ity...your opinion
of yourself. » _

You didn’t think about that.You'd concentrated so hard on
the impression you were going to make that you’d
forgotten you could undo it in spite of yourself. It behooves
you to discover in a full-length mirror just what secrets
you’re telling behind your own back!

Do you strut? Shoulders back...head tilted...nose
skyward? Is your pan slightly dead ...eyebrows elevated?
You may be the friendliest person in the world ...but
your walk is saying that you care only about you.

Do you scoot? Your tailfeathers close to the ground ...
shoulders bent against the wind .‘..arms ﬂaying the air for
cxtra momentum ? You may be capable of the weighiiest
.thoughts...but you impress folks as being too hurried to
stick to one subject...too ﬁckle for long-range friendships
You’re fun .. .but not to be taken seriously.

Do you slink? Joints all limber...leading with the
tummy? Your disposition may be quite deﬁnite...but
you’re making people think you’re unsure and shy.

They expect you to have a buttery voice...to fawn for
favors...to spill over with gush and goo.

Do you swish? Feet dancing .. .skirts swaying...head
tossing...e_yes alight...voice full of song? It goes with
bouncing good humor and a lively interest in stuff and things
Such in stride invites people to join the parade with you.

‘ _Artistry with make-up and clothes can accomplish wonder!
with your raw material. But three or more thoughts to your
posture will help you keep a few other secrets to yourself!

Freshman Cagers  

Try “No Cut’ Plan

By Joe Santone

Everybody‘ gets into the act when freshman report for
basketball practice at Pitt Stadium.

Adopting a new plan for selection of team members, Dr.
H. C. Carlson, head coach, stated all freshmen should con-
tinue to report for daily practice sessions at the stadium.

Coached by Tay Malarkey, candidates will stage intra-
squad games during the three weeks prior to Christmas vacation.

Clinic on Tap

For Referees

The IM foobtall season is over,
but many of the arguments which
cropped up during the campaign
are still going on.

Seldom did two IM sixes meet
without a rhubarb ensuing over a
rule / interpretation, or a referee's

- decision. .

0

To clear things. up for basketball,

season, the IM office is gathering
the referees and team managers
tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 p. m.
at Trees Gym for a basketball
clinic.

With two IM quintets taking the
ﬂoor, A. L. Walsh, local basketball
official will demonstrate and dis-
cuss troublesome situations that
may develop during‘ a game.

From now until December 15,
the opening day of hoop play, the
teams will be working out and en-

—» gaging in practice games at Tree's

Gym and the Stadium ﬂoor in late
afternoon and evenings.

Daily scrimmage began yester-
day, with games listed for 2 and
3 p. m. Although all men must
bring along their own basketball
equipment, lockers are provided.

“In this way,” Carlson added,
“no man can say he never had a
chance to play basketball for Pitt.”
Carlson also claimed no “cuts”
would be made by the basketball
coaches. Only those dropping
themselves will decrease the size
of Malarkey’s squad.

This year is the ﬁrst for the new
system, but it isn’tthe first in in-
tercollegiate athletics at Pitt. Back
in the early 20’s, when Dr. Carlson
coached the freshman gridders, he
used the same system. '

Everybody was invited to play
and no cuts were made. In this
way, it is hoped to discover any
hidden talent among freshman and
to “just give the boys a chance to
prove themselves.” A

Complete records of individual
performances will be maintained
by the coaching staff. Aside from
the intra-squad games, instruc-
tion will be given by Coach Ma-
larkey.

Dear Mike,

An Open Leffer
To Head Coach
Mike Milligan

Golightly

My association with you and the members of your staﬂ
has been one of the more pleasant aspects of my job as.Sports
Editor. As you probably know, it’s difﬁcult to criticize your

friends.

malice but only with the hope
next year.

Any, criticism whichvI oﬁer here is presented not with

that it will eﬁect improvement

This was the most disastrous football season since 1903.
It would be a simple matter toO '

discuss the tough schedule and
to lament over injuries to key
players.
Staff Did a. Fine Job

Certainly, both the schedule and
the injuries were largely respon-
sible for Pitt's
miserable rec-
ord. You and
your aides did

chanically. But
there is more to
coaching than
the simple me-
chanics of block
and tackle.
Any coach
worthy of the
name recognizes
he has a greater responsibility.
It’s all very well to drill away at
fundamentals. It may even be cor-
rect to play defensive ball and
“hold down the score.” ‘

A coach‘-Who believes in himself
and his method of teaching should
take some pride in his team. He
should, above a1l,'have confidence
in his players, and he must ex-
press that conﬁdence.

Coach Lacked Conﬁdence

I don’t think it’s asking too
much of a coach to have his play-
ers “up” for two games a year.

Collectively and individually,
Mike, your staff failed theteam
in the important matter of pride
in their work and conﬁdence in
the" players.

Some of your statements to the
press prior to several away games
were not only brutal in their im-
pact but almost a direct insult to
your players. ,

Players Thought of Winning

It was the same all season. You,
Josh, Bob,‘ and Dick concentrat-
ed on defense while the players
thought of offense and winning
ball games. There was too much
time spent on X’s and O’s on the
blackboard.

There was too much talk about
how big the other team was. Too
much enlphasis on how good they
were. It showed up on the playing
field, Mike. _

Last year the young Panthers

a ﬁne job me-

scorned reputation. They played

out ‘the string in every ball game, -

and their morale was high all
season. .-

Morale Dropped Steadily
They were a ﬁghting ball club.
After the Illinois game this

year, the morale went down and
down until it hit the season low
during the Penn State game. May-
be the team just run out of gas
aaginst the Nittany Lions.

But it wa=s the most inept, life-
less performance Pitt displayed in
two seasons. I can’t say with any
certainty whether we might have

limited ability of our players.
But I object to the pessimistic
attitude which’ prevailed ‘ and
thrived among the coaches. Many
of your players puzzled "over this
pessimism. They wanted to know
how they were expected to ‘win

in them. ~. .

They resented your attitude and
it affected their playing.

.Next. year these same players
will return, and thereinlies your
big task. You must recapture their
_conﬁdence. You must ‘express your
conﬁdence in them. If you want
your team to play defensive ball,
you must convince them that it
is necessary. , ‘

Tell them why. In other words,
Mike, convince your players that
your system is a good sound one.

' ‘ Sincerely, '
JOHN GOLIGHTLY.

the Mountaineers feel good,

They didn’t play much football
at the Stadium on Saturday but
the .spectators found no lack of
entertainment.

The obviously pickled youth, for
instance, who bounced through the
aisles in his undershirt while
some 12,000 customers, clothed in

. everything from blankets to bear-

skins, roared.

Down on the ﬁeld the West Vir-
ginians attempted to color up their
play by dickering and debating
with the officials on every penalty.

Mountaineers Play Rough

Pushing the Panthers around
for the ﬁrst time in 19 years made
so
they rubbed it in with a touch of
rough house tactics, as well.

The Pitts, nevertheless, hardly
gave the Mountaineers an argu-
ment. They looked like a bunch

and rung out so many times they
couldn’t be used again.

passes. End Bill McPeak took most
of them and ran the ball like a

Then, too, Bill Bruno was al-
most his customary rock-like self
on defense.

Panthers Plug Along

But as a unit the Panthers were
a ragged lot. Their offensive tac-
tics showed little imagination, as
they plugged at the West Virginia
forward wall throughout the ﬁrst

‘ half.

The few passes thrown wobbled
through the air like lost hats on a
windy day. Pitt’sl passing attack

Kern Accepts Victory

Kern took the Pitt victory with
calm satisfaction. “Naturally it’s
a great thrill for the boys,” ‘he
commented, “to be the first‘West
Virginia team in 19 years to beat
Pitt.” . '

The Mountaineers ‘ made their
locker room a merry scene, while
over in the Pitt dressing room
spirit was lower than the ther-
mometer. Thousands of blue-lip-
ped fans will testify just how low
that was.

West Va. Out-Farces
Pitt in Finale, 1.7-2

By Donald Giffin
The Panther growled once or twice, chuckled brieﬂy, then
scramed silently in the wake of West Virginia’s 17-2 victory

last Saturday.

He was laughing at the 12,000 frigid fans hurrying from
the icebox Stadium, few of whom knew the ﬁnal score.
Some, football, mixed in with a little basketball and soccer,

gave Pitt a two—point safety "on the last play of the contest.

These two points came just in¢. .

ing shutout for the fourth straight
Week. _
.. Jinxes Licked .

This defeat, the eighth in nine
games, closed a season that will
be remembered for many years,
even though it should be forgot-
ten as quickly as possible.

Jinxes,/too, took a licking. The
Mountaineers won their ﬁrst Sta-
dium struggle since 1928, follow-
ing Penn 'State’s hoodoo-smashing
triumph over Pitt a week earlier.

Although they set two seasonal
records, the Panthers looked dead-
er against West Virginia than they
did against State.

Set Two Puny Records

The two records, puny ones,
were “yards rushing” and ;“pass
completion” marks. Pitt connect-

'when you're‘ listening to HAL Mc|N'l'YRE’S 

ed with ten passes, most of them
heaved by Halfback Bobby Lee.
Five of them came in ‘a row in
the last quarter, pacing the long-
est drive of the day, 50 yards.

The Panthers gained 52 yards
rushing, but nobody is going to
gloat about that.

Against their weakest opponent
of the year, the Panthers looked
bad. The Mountaineers didn't
look much better.

In fact, one person commented,
“It’s a good thing that wasn’t a

would hold up their purses.”

newest (MGM) record

NE OF the grooviest ork-pilots on the MGM record roster
, _ is Hal McIntyre. Like so many other top-notch
performers, Hal is a Camel fan from ’way back. He prefers

Camels because: “Camels suit me best all ways.”
For the same reason-—more people are smoking
Camels than ever before! A great new record for a

long-time favorite.

Try Camels. Discover for yourself why, with
smokers who have tried and compared,
Camels are the “choice of experience.”

Optimism Continues

At Varsity Practice

.Not much mention has been made of it but the current Pitt

basketball season is almost with us. On December 12, the Pan-

ther will make his ’~/17348 debut
of \Viseonsin.

at Madison with the University

At the little court under the stadium, the usual optimism
abounds; Coach Dr. H. C. Carlson offers his annual forecast
that Well Will ’em all.” They won’t. But the spirit makes

for good basketball.

Captain Nate Apple and \Vally Zernich are the only two

missing lettermen from last year:
Dr. Apple is now a practicing den-
tist in Ford City ‘while Zernich is
attending Medical School.

’Carlson will ﬁeld three ﬁrst
stringers from the past season.
Bill Cieply, Dodo Canterna, and
Sam David -return from the '47
quintet.

In addition, letter winners Ed
Latagliata, Ralph Forquer, and
Bimbo Cecconi are back. Tom Ra-
gan, a regular in 1943-44, is also
back.

A newcomer, Mort Lerner, looks
very promising. Lerner .had con-
siderable service experience. He is
big, aggressive, and will probably
be the regular center. Much is
also expected of Ted Geremski of _
the football team.

Pitt’s schedule looks very in-
teresting from the player’s view-
point. They have a midwestern
