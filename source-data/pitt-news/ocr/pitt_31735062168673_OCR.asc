Dr. Cottam Questions Use of
. Game Theory in Viet Policy
,,

by ROBERT ZAVOS

At a talk sponsored by
Beacon House in Tower B
Dr. Ric-hard Cottam main-
tained that he had strong
reservations about the John-
son Administration’s policy
in Vietnam.

He based his objections on a
fallacy that many inﬂuential the-
orists use in planning foreign po-
licy. Basically, they use a “Di-

plomacy Is Bargaining” policy.“

They employ game theory and
would rather bargain for the sake
of bargaining, then look at speci-
ﬁc problems. “It is true that di-
" plomacy includes bargaining, but
certainly they cannot be equated,”
noted Dr. Cottam.
Dr. Cottam gave an example
where the US and the Soviet
Union bargained to get rid of a

few obsolete planes last year. The

outcome was insigniﬁcant as far
as the planes went, but it did
further relations. In this case bar-
gaining was worthwhile.

However, bargain theoretists
have not accomplished much in
Vienam, implied Dr. Cottam.
Rather than maintain a policy of
containment they advocated bomb-
ings of North Vietnam to force
the communists to the bargaining
table. “In game theory it is neces-
sary not only to do things to
change your opponents way of
thinking, but your opponent must
also know what you are donig,”
suggested Dr. Cottam.

In this respect we have failed
miserably, since we have given
our opponent two confusing sig-
nals. On the one hand, President
Johnson has suggested that if
they come to the bargaining table

we will abide by the Geneva ac-
cords, which would eventually
mean total withdrawal. On the
other hand, Dean Rusk has said,
“Come to the bargaining table
and we will stop bombing.

“The ﬁrst case would actually
mean victory for the communists,
and I can’t see why they won't
accept,” stated Dr. Cottam. Prob-
ably Rusk’s statements have milli-
tated against this since ceasation
of bombings is another story,

In fact, Dr. Cottam suggested
that our bombings of the North
were “playing only a minor role
in the outcome of the,war.” We
are bombing things like the Ho
Chi Minh Trail rather than sup-
ply depots, harbors or military

, installations.

The reason for not bombing
these more important targets is
the fear of bringing China or even
the Soviet Union into the war.

But, Dr. Cottam suggested, our ‘

gradual increases in escalation
may one day go too far and then
we will have World War III.

Dr. Cottam believes that our
policy may have been responsi-
ble for the recent changes in Chi-
nese leadership. In particular,
“The less moderates have come
into power, probably because of

the Chinese increased fear of

the US.” However, Dr. Cottam
also suggested, “Our containment
policy might be responsible for
the more moderate stand of the
Soviet Union over the last few
years.”

Dr. Cottam said, “We could win
easily in Vietnam by bombing
worthwhile targets; we could turn
North Vietnam into a parking lot
if we wanted to, but whether the
Soviet Union would continue to
stand by idly against constant.
pressure from other communist
countries is another question.”

Speaker to Discuss ,
Draftees’ Rights Case

The question of whether
an American citizen should
be free to choose between
serving his conscience or
obeying military orders, will
be at issue Friday in 223
Langley Hall at 8 p.m. Stanley
Faulkner, an attorney who repre-
sents the Fort Hood Three, three
Army draftees who refused to
follow orders to ﬁght in Vietnam,
v.'ill speak.

Uncertain about the war’s ob-
jectives when they entered the
Army, the Fort Hood Three de-
cided" that the war violates the
US Constitution and UN Charter.
They ﬁled an injunction against
the Army in a US District Court
in‘ June.

The men believe that the war
is immoral, illegal, and unjust,
and that it does not’ serve" the

    
 

They express strong moral con-
victions against killing people
without a just cause.

Following their September con-
viction for disobeying orders,
with sentences ranging from three
to ﬁve years at hard labor, the
Fort Hood Three received. wide-
spread support from those who
believe that the preservation of
fundamental civil liberties is at
stake. Efforts are being made to
bring the case before civilian
courts. Appeals to higher mili-
tary courts are also being pur-
sued.

Their case depends largely on
the expression of free speech and
free inquiry among the American
people, and is a crucial eﬁort to
preserve that right.

for experimentation. Some of the
experiments which will be made
in the short term are study away

instruction.

Second advantage of the‘ pro-

teacher three. In the six-week
session the typical load for both
will be two courses.

Third advantage is that most

  Peace Corps Improves
Foreign View of US  

The Peace Corps has gone far.
toward improving the United
States’ image abroad, particular-
ly in the globe-circling belt of 52
developing countries where 15,-
000 volunteers now serve.

An opinion proﬁle drawn re-
cently by Louis Harris pollsters

‘from conversations with 1,200

college seniors across the nation
showed that 51 per cent felt the .-
Peace Corps helped to cast a fav-
orable American image overseas;
86 per cent said they believed
the Peace Corps was doing an

 “excellent” or “good” job.

The poll was undertaken to de-
termine student attitudes toward
the Peace Corps and other public
affairs issues, such as the Viet-
nam war, civil rights and the
War on Poverty.

The Peace Corps was judged
the most successful American ef-
ford abroad in terms of not only

. , promoting a better “image,” but

of improving the well-being of
foreign peoples.

Attitudes diverged, however,
between the total sample of sen-
iors and about 250 who already_
had been accepted by the Peace
Corps. The latter group viewed
Peace Corps service as a “chance
to make personal contact and
help create mutual understand-
ing” between American and for-
eigners, while the average senior
felt that an improved US image
was the best thing to be derived
from the Peace Corps.

Said the Harrisreport: “There
is a distinct sense of potential
commitment and action” among
those thinking of or having._al-
ready applied to the Peace Corps.

But how many “committed
youth” are there? Most seniors,
the survey pointed out, are ca-
reer-oriented.

“It is clear,” the report says,
“that if the Peace Corps is to
widen and intensify its appeal it
must convince many seniors that
two years in the Peace Corps is
relevant to their future career}?

students, especially in their last
two years, will have at least one
experience in the middle term
that will approach the tutorial
method. I ﬁrmly believe that the
superiority of the small, indepen-
dent college rests in large meas-
ure upon the close relationship
between teachers and students.

We must continue to guarantee
that most of our classes are small
enough so that the teachers can
know one student's work from
another’s. We should also attempt
to guarantee that every student
have at least one experience in a
class so small that he can have
the almost exclusive attention of
the teacher. We cannot afford
such a program if it lasts through
a whole semester. We hope it
will be possible in the six-week
term.

programs designed for peo-
ple who have not yet com-
pleted their schooling.

Miss Blender spent her sum-
mer in Israel at the Kibbutz of
Beth Keshet, where she -worked
in the ﬁelds and the nurserys of
the settlement. Miss London spent
her time in Kenya. There she as-
sisted in several village develop-

_ ment projects._ These were at the

Koy-Koy cooperative farm near
Kitale and the Elodoro Catholic
Mission at the foot of Mount
Kilominjaro.

When Miss London's group ﬁrst
arrived at the Koy-Koy farm,
they found that a school build-.

'ing project had been abandoned.»

The villagers, through lack of in-
terest and other commitments,

had slowly seen their ambition’

slip away. ,

The group immediately set to
work reviving the project. With
primitive tools and no experience
at all in masonry, they ﬁred more
than 5,000 bricks and erected half
a wall. “Our task was not just to
build these things ourselves, but
to get the people working on
their own,” said Miss London.
“We were going to have to leave
after a few weeks,‘ but we tried
to arouse spirit."

Miss Blender’s situation was a.
little different. The inhabitants
of Beth Keshet were all we1l-ed-

ucated and culturally sophisti- .

cated. Moreover, there is “great
spirit” in the kibbutzes,‘ she said,
“The people at Beth Keshet know
what they are working for. They
want a secure life for their chil-
dren, and they feel if they can
btuild up the land they will have
1 .”

Miss Blender was particularly
impressed with the social struc-
ture of the Kibbutz, especially the
raising of the children. “The chil-
dren don’t live at home, but in
coed children's houses until they
are 14,” she said. “Then they
have a chance to move to more
private quarters if they want to
You might think that this means
that the children have very little
privacy, but that isn't true. It's
just that they have a different
kind. When the kids want to be
alone, they just sit on their beds,
and somehow the message gets to
everyone else that they don’t
want to be bothered. It works
Very well.’’‘ ‘

spend most of their time with
them until they are old enough
to work. Family ties remain
strong -under this system. Miss
Blender, even though she was
only there for the summer, was

assigned to a. family, who every- ,

one thought of as hers.

Both girls found that being an
American in a foreign country
can sometimes be a mixed bless-
ing. They found people to be
critical of many of our actions
and mores.

“Everywhere I went nobody
likes Americans,” Toni said, “no
one trusts our motives; no one
understands Vietnam." At the
same time, as soon as people
learned what the girls were there
for, they loosened up and became
friendly. “We were spreading
good faith,” Toni said, “and the
people understood what we were
doing.”

Suddenly Depleted Hoopsters

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Carnegie Tech may ﬁnd things a bit
easier against the Panther basketball team
in the season's opener for both teams to-
morrow night at the Field House, 8:15 p.m.

The cagers’ bench strength had been considered
as their strong point. Coach Bob Timmons had
been looking forward to manipulating a team ten
deep in. reliable ball players.

But he won’t be able to, not until next term
anyway‘. It has been decreed by the eligibility com-
mittee of the University that two promising sopho-
mores, Tim Fisher and Sylvester Stevenson, will
be unable to play the ﬁrst nine games on the
schedule because of scholastic difficulties. -

“I got the news the morning of the freshman
game,” Timmons disclosed. “That's why neither of
them saw too much action that night.”

Timmons has the problem of what to do with
both players. He can’t include them in the daily
practices that stress offensive and defensive strate-
gy geared towards speciﬁc opponents because

Host Tech as Season Opens

, they won't be playing.

Yet he can’t forget about them. “I just hope
they'll stay in shape,” he said. “Of course, there
goes some of the bench we’d been planning on.’_’

“We’ve lost three of our best sophomores,” he
winced. “Fisher, Stevenson, and (Dave) Welty to
baseball." Timmons had praise for one of his re-
maining sophomores and expressed disappoint-
ment in two others.

Len Kalata provided the good play against the
fresh while Al DeFrischia and Tony DeLisio were
not as encouraging. “DeFrischia can play better
than he showed,” said Timmons. “And Delisio
seemed to be taking his shots off-balance. He shot
coming down instead of at the top of his jump.”

The three other starters, Stan Falenski, Ken
Bollens, and Jim LaValley, played well enough.
Falenski shot 64 per cent and along with Bollens
emerged with “top” ratings from the game. La-
Valley, according to Timmons, wasn’t far behind
them.

A couple of strategic problems cropped up and
hopefully will be corrected by tomorrow. “There
was too much fouling, for one,” Timmons noted‘.
“We're playing an aggressive defense but that’s
no excuse for giving the other team the one-and-
one situation so early.

“Also, we have a tendency to shoot too quickly.
If there’s no fast break, we have to work for the
good shot,” he explained.

With his bench depleted, Timmons has indi-
cated that he'll slow down his offense consider-

freshman Bob Petrini in the Hall of Fame last

Tuesday night. Falenski emerged from the contest
as the top rated varsity player.

ably and still keep a ball-hawking, pressuring de-
fense. ‘

What about Carnegie Tech? “They lost Jim
Brown, their center, and Ray Morrison, their top
scorer,” Timmons pointed out. “But Jeff Kalin’s
back. He’s probably their best ball player.”

Kalin has made it a habit of giving the Pan-
thers trouble over the past three years. Yet Tech
is yet to beat the cagers in that period. Timmons
hopes the string will still be intact after tomorrow
night.

Coach Likes Winning, But:

Frosh Geared to Defense, Future

by MIKE BROURMAN

Under coach Tim Grgur-
ich, freshman basketball has
been the winningest sport at
the University. But, according to
Grgurich, his primary concern is
not in ‘developing a winner.

“This is a year for learning,"
said Grgurich. “We try to win all
the time, but the main job is to
develop these boys for the var-
sity.”

To accomplish this,- Grgurich.
concentrates on fundamentals
and defense, especially defense.
"If they get this, they’re going to
win,” he said.

Defense was in evidence in last
week’s game with the varsity,
and Grgurich was very pleased
with that aspect of his team’s per-
formance. “Defensively, we did
very well. We’re right where we
should be, especially the inside
men. They did a real ﬁne job.”

Grgurich has a system which
awards points to players for de-
fensive plays such as steals and
blocked shots. Against the varsi-
ty, Bob Petrini, a converted for-
ward now playing guard, had
nine “points.” The big men, Mike
Patcher, Charlie Hunt, and Bob
McFarland had six, four, and
four, respectively, while guard I
Dick Hassinger had three.

Grgurich was also pleased by
the play of his bench. “I thought

and Winﬁeld John played real
well defensively.”

Less pleasing to the coach, but
understandable, was the offense.
“The offense is behind the de-
fense, but it's my fault. I haven’t
been working on it.”

“We had a lot of bad passes,
especially in the ﬁrst half. At the
beginning, I think they were too
excited. There were too many
lob passes, and there was too
much hesitation. Also, we weren't
moving enough without the ball.
But, that’s mainly because they
don't know each other’s moves
yet.”

Grgurich is conﬁdent, however,
that the offense will develop. “It
will catch up. Potentially, they’re
all good shooters. As they get to
know each other better, things
{V111 fall into place.”

One thing that really pleased
Grgurich was the spirit and de-
termination the frosh showed. “In
high school, as far as competition
goes, you can’t ﬁnd any that’s
any better than what they faced.
A coach can’t ask for more than
that.

“When they were behind the
varsity right away, 18-9, a lot of
teams would have quit right then.
But, they know how to win, and

 Sig Chi Takes Frat Championship;

House of Lords Gains Dorm Final

A strong defensive unit
was the central point in Sig-
ma C-hi’s drive for the A
League fraternity champion-
ship. Again last Tuesday, the
Chi’s defense dominated as they
won the all-fraternity champion-
ship by a 6-2 score over Delta
Iota Delta.

The B League champions got
on the scoreboard early in the
game. Only a few minutes into
the ﬁrst quarter, the DID’s de-
fense trapped Sigma Chi quarter-
back Jim Daniels in his own end
zone for a two point safety.

But that was all the scoring
the DIDs could manage as the
Sigma Chi defense played true to.
its championship form and com-
pletely contained the DID of-
fense for the whole afternoon. I

Ralph Manning and Jim sat

wicki led the winning defense to
its glory. Sawicki at middle line-
backer chased the DID quarter-
back all day. Manning played a
brilliant game at halfback on

both offense and defense. But it

was especially his two intercep-
tions that made the difference.

In the third period, Manning
grabbed a DID pass on the losers’
ﬁve yard line. Two plays later,
Jim Daniels hit end Dave Weirs-
ma in --the end zone for the only
touchdown of the day. Manning
also snared a DID aerial on his
own three yard line to stop the
losers cold.

Meanwhile in the dorm leagues,
House of Lords edged Mad House
by a 9-6 score to get the oppor-
tunity to meet Sutherland House
in the dorm championship game.

Once again, a defense was the
ﬁrst unit 1:) score as the Lords’
managed a safety _early in the
game. ‘But this time, the offense
added its own points. Quarter-
back Bob Peck shot through the
Mad line and outran the sec-
ondary on a spectacular 60 yard
run. A pass from Peck to. John
Morrison in the end zone gave
the Lords a one point conversion
and that was all they needed.

Syntype Ftrove abit-For

Students now using sensational new Syntype self-
correcting typewriter ribbon are reported to have
become addicts instantly, the first time they tried it.

Guys and gals interviewed say they were literally
transported into a different world—one completely,
blessedly free from fear of making typing errors on

themes, term pa pers, etc.

Adding to the ecstatic feeling of unreality expe-
rienced by users is the fact that errors vanish like
magic; the typing and correcting are both achieved
by use of the nylon ribbon.

This habit-forming new product fits all makes and
models, portable and standard . . . costs no more
than other high-quality ribbons. Syntype is available
at the campus book store‘ and at stationery stores in .--
town. Or mail coupon today!
