Students set to support professor
Med school prof, no. 2 UPMC administrator Sheldon Adler asked to resign

Elaine Clifford

Staff Wrlter

Pitt medical students said they’re
on a fact-finding mission to show sup-
port for the UPMC’s No. 2 administra-
tor, Dr. Sheldon Adler, who was asked
to resign by the medical school’s inter-
im dean.

Dan Bensimhon, a fourth-year
medical student at Pitt, said he doesn’t

understand the Pitt medical professor’s 4

dismissal. “No one is ‘clear on what
happened, we only know the results.”
According to University Senate
President Gordon MacLeod, Adler
agreed to represent five faculty mem-
bers who wished to voice displeasure
with George Michalopoulos, the med-
ical school’s interim dean. MacLeod
said the five wanted to reschedule the

school-wide meeting Michalopoulos
planned for mid-March. It was held on
Feb. 3. ,

Because the faculty members
wished to remain anonymous, they
made two copies of the request, one
signed and one unsigned. Adler was
given the signed version and
Michalopoulos received the unsigned
letter, MacLeod said.

When Michalopou1o_s asked for the

names of the five anonymous faculty at .

the meeting, Adler reluctantly supplied
the information. __

Michalopoulos was openly upset
when a private discussion between him
and Adler was paraphrased in a memo
passed out at the school-wide meeting,
according to MacLeod. Michalopoulos
claimed that this action was a breach of
confidentiality, MacLeod said.

Bensimhon said that it was suppos-
edly this breach of confidentiality
between deans that caused Adler’s
forced resignation the day after the
meeting. '

The University Times quoted
Michalopoulos at the Feb. 3 meeting as
saying he found it “distressing” the let-
ter was unsigned. I think if we don’t
hold the line and ask people to speak
up, nothing will ever change,” said
Michalopoulos.

Michalopoulos was unavailable for
comment. Dr. Thomas Detre, the senior
vice chancellor of health sciences said
he had no comment.

MacLeod said he’s concerned
about Adler’s dismissal. “The decision
to oust Dr. Adler was too precipitous;

For The Pitt News

Chad Crisp said he’s concerned that the University
will take away his fraternity’s North Dithridge Street
house, which it’s owned since 1921, and force him and
his brothers to move on campus. -

There is a great sense of tradition and pride that __F,_

comes from living in the house, according to the Pi
Lambda Phi president;

“That’s why alumni keep coming back here,” he
said, “because the house is the same as it was 80 years
ago.”

Crisp’s fraternity may be moving closer to the
Cathedral soon because Pitt no longer allows off-cam-
pus student organizations, including fraternities, to be
recognized by the University. Pitt also won’t allow cur-
rently recognized organizations to dwell on non-
University property. ’

This new policy, announced recently by Director of
Student Activities Joseph Cavalla, states that no student
group may lease, purchase or occupy any off-campus
residence. Student organizations that own an off-cam-
pus house may continue to operate there, but organiza-
tions seeking to reinstate their recognition must comply
with the policy.

This means that off-campus fraternities that have
lost their recognition, for example, Phi Gamma Delta

Well, those words aren’t

phrases like these help him sell

Don’t plan to sit home alone this
Valentine’s Day. Pitt’s Resident
Student Association said it wants
students to party all night, especial-
ly if they don’t have dates.

As the grand finale of the first

RSA week since the 1970s, the RSA .

will pick ‘up most of the costs of
“all-night bowling” on Saturday. For
just $5, Pitt students can take a shut-
tle to Bowling City to bowl and play
unlimited pool from midnight to 3
a.m. -

Armed last night with hot coffee
and dressed in warm sweats,
sweaters and scarves, Pitt sopho-
mores Erin Colligan and Jennifer
Middlebrough waited at the William
Pitt Union with about 35 other stu-
dents to take a shuttle to another
RSA—sponsored ‘event — free ice
skating at Schenley Park.

Colligan, a studio arts major,
said, “I'm pumped for the
O1ympics”.and added that this made
her want to go skating.

The two don’t have datesifor
Valentine’s Day, but they’re not
worried because they plan to bowl
their way through the wee hours of
Saturday. ‘

“It’s better than staying home by
yourself,” Middlebrough said,
laughing.

RSA President Michael ‘Unangst
said the RSA board wants this week-

end’s events to target single people.

“We know there are a lot of peo-
ple who might end up in their rooms
Saturday night,” he said. “This way
people can get out on Valentine’s
Day.” .

Tomorrow night, the student
bands Broken Sylvan, Going Postal
and Papa Jack will perform in
Eddie’s cafeteria. Unangst said he’s
happy students will provide the
night’s entertainment for their peers.

“We picked those three bands
because you don’t 'need'a date to
watch a band and eat some cookies,”
Unangst said. ,

Friday night, the RSA will team
up with the Pitt Program Council to
show the movie “Kiss the Girls” at 8
and 10 p.m. in the David Lawrence
Auditorium.

Earlier this week, the RSA spon-
sored a Twister tournament and an
appearance by comedian Bruce
Block. Interestingly, Block holds an
8-year-old record in the “Guinness
Book of World Records” for bounc-
ing cigar boxes off his chin (whatev--_
er that means). '

foster a feeling of community with
these campus events. Students hope

THE PIT|' NEWS

Faculty get new health plan;
must pay higher premiums

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

Pitt released its new health bene-
fits plan last week and announced it
will offer employees two health insur-
ance options, but for only one year.

In addition to the present
Highmark Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, Pitt will offer its employees
the TRI—STATE HMO, a UPMC—run
plan. Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
Pitt tried to reach a long-term contract
but that neither insurer was willing to
sign a contract with the University for
longer than a year.

“It’s a reﬂection of how unsure
the health market is,” he said.

.“They’re reluctant to go beyond a

one—year deal.” Service said the mar-
ket’s instability caused a price
increase to Pitt.

As a result, Pitt’s health—care costs
will balloon from $25 million to $31
million next year. To pay for the $6
million increase, the University will
provide‘. 65 percent and employees
will be responsible for 35 percent.

Service said that although these
changes will not be reﬂected in the co.-
payments, employees will pay for the
35-percent increase through higher
premiums.

The Highmark plan offers Pitt
employees three options,'Service said.

The “Comprehensive” option, the
first of the three choices, provides the
widest range of coverage but has the

highest cost. The “Select Blue” option.

is the middle plan. It offers less cover-
age than the “Comprehensive” plan
but at less cost to the employee. The
cheapest choice is the “Keystone
Health Plan West,” Highmark’s HMO.

Keystone gives the least coverage but
doesn’t require a premium, just co—’
payments when employees obtain
health care.

Service said he didn’t know the
dollar amount of the premiums for the
“Comprehensive” plan and the “Select
Blue” plan.

The TRI-STATE HMO will give
employees just one option and can
only be used at UPMC facilities,
according to Service. Like other HMO
plans, there will be no premium.

The previous Highmark plan also
had three options, and Service said it
cost considerably less than most
health insurance does today.

He added that the old contract had
a price cap that didn’t allow the pre-
mium to rise each year.

- Service said the increase this year _

will be bigger than normal but that Pitt
employees have had the benefit of
unusually low premiums for the past
three years. He also said the cost‘ of
health insurance has risen during the
past three years.

Service said Pitt chose the plans
for their scope of coverage, good cus-
tomer service, a clearly established
and workable grievance policy for dis-
agreements that employees might
have with the plan, and adequate cov-
erage for Pitt’s regional campuses.

He said the new insurance plan

will expire on June 1, 1999 so that Pitt .

will have to take bids from companies
again starting this fall.

Service said the University will

send detailed descriptions of the new
plans to every Pitt employee in early
March. Employees’ enrollment begins
in mid-March for them to sign up for
their plan of choice.

only sales but chuckles from people
walking by.

“She’s beautiful,” Steiner said to a
man walking down the street with a
woman. The woman laughed and said,
“Thank you.” Steiner just nodded,
smiling. .

He’s not afraid to tell a woman on
the street that she’s. beautiful. And
he’s not doing it just to sell ﬂowers,
either.

“I love girls,” he said.

He shows his affection for women
through most of his pitches, such as
“As Beautiful as every single living

-female,” which are centered around

women. ~
When no one is walking by, he
says he sits on the stone wall and

 thinks of new phrases.

“Saying things over and over

again is boring,” said Steiner. “People

throw things back" at you and say,
‘You told me that line last time!’’’

Though his method is boisterous,
he says he’s not as outgoing as he
sounds. Sometimes he gets embar-
rassed and jumbles his phrases.

He said he also gets misinterpret-
ed.

One day a few years ,ago, he
yelled -a signature phrase, “Flowers, a
reﬂection of your innermost beauty!”
A woman walking by thought he said
“Flowers, they’d look great (with your
enormous booty!” The woman wasn’t
happy, he said.

But he keeps on going, and even

’ in the middle of the worst rainstorms,

his voice can be heard above all the
trafﬁc.“Beautiful ﬂowers for beautiful
ladies!”

Across the Nation

PHILADELPHIA — Reaction has
been mixed among City officials since
the head of the Archdiocese of
Philadelphia issued a statement object-
ing to proposals to extend same—sex—
partner benefits to all businesses in the
city. .
City Council President John Street
says he opposes forcing local business-
es to extend beneﬁts to same—sex part-
ners. .

But Councilman Jim Kenney says
the change would guarantee that all
Philadelphia workers have the same
on-the-job rights.

Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua yes-
terday announced his opposition to
three proposed ordinances that would
radically alter health benefits and job
promotions for homosexuals across
Philadelphia.

The archbishop wrote that the pro-
posals are destructive to the “city’s

moral and social structure because they ‘

 promote and protect homosexual
relationships.” He said, “The marital
relationship shared by husband and
wife constitutes the only true and last-
ing partnership.”

had carjacked. ‘He surrendered when
confronted by officers.

ver was treated for minor injuries after

Variety is the
spice of life

Behavior control. Uniformity. Loss of individuality.-
Eradication of visible differences between human beings.

School uniforms. _

That's the new terror the Big Apple is facing.

New York City was founded by a variety of peoples
of different cultures. Probably more languages are spo-
ken daily in that city than anywhere else in this country;
It is the truest melting pot of our country.

But Monday, the president of the New York City
Board of Education, William C. Thompson Jr., proposed

a plan that seems to run contrary to that great tradition of a

diversity — a plan to require uniforms for elementary
school kids in the public school system, beginning in the
fall of 1999.

Proponents of the plan argue senselessly that hiding
the differences between children will allow them to get
along better. And of course, they cite the cliche that kids
kill each other over sneakers nowadays. '

Yeah, and while we're at it, let's make everybody
speak English, cut their hair short, listen to the same
music and walk in single ﬁle lines everywhere. ‘ —

There's something eerie about a building full of chil-
dren, all dressed in white shirts and navy blue pants and
trying very hard to obey the rule that they avoid being
different from each other. ' -

It's actually a bit reminiscent of bad science—frction
movies with no background music, where everybody is
bald, dresses in white robes and lives underground in
clean white corridors, their every thought and action
monitored by some computer to make sure everybody is
"equal."

There are a lot of arguments against school uniforms.
Parents have to buy two sets of clothes for their kids -
one for school and one for afterward. Some claim that
clothing is an expression of individuality, and young peo-
ple need a chance to be fashionable if that's what they
want. » '

But the most common complaint is that people want
to feel like individuals.

\V1th all the emphasis in recent years that has been

put on accepting others and respecting our differences — ‘

whether those variances manifest "themselves in race,
age, sex or belief -—_- eradicating our differences in
appearance seems to be counterproductive.

The key to our evolving together as a society will be
accepting each otl1er's differences, not trying to hide
them. And what better time to start learning how to do
that than when we are young?

News media doesn't understand

Tara

Buck

Yesterday I received my
weekly issue of Time maga-
zine. Since then, one question
has been weighing heavily on
my mind: Why am I still hear-
ing about this Monica
Lewinsky chick? .

I don't care about her.
Everyone else I've talked to
doesn't care about her, either.

Why is the media insistent on-

bombarding all _of us with
information we're not really
concerned about?

I've never studied mass
communications, . so I'm not
pretending to be informed

about how it functions. I just

want to - know, as most
Americans do, why in the hell
someone thinks that ‘we think
these things are important.

I really would like to read‘

about what is going on in Iraq.

"I expected the Iraqi affair

would be exhausted by cover-
age in such publications as
Time —- obviously, I was

wrong. I learned of Iraq only-
-after perusing 20 pages on

Monica. (Even then, Iraq was
only given two.)

When did the media decide
that all the average American is
capable of understanding is
tabloid-like news stories with
no pertinence _to everyday life?

How have we American
citizens allowed the media to
delve into such stories without
our consent? Perhaps the popu-
larity of such programs as "A
Current Affair" or "American

Journal" has distorted the main-
stream media's conception of
actual and/or important news.
But how could this have hap-
pened? . - _

_ I can't possibly imagine
Dan Rather believing that

Monica’ is top—story material. -

What does Dan think of all
this? Probably not much, as

long as the checks keep rolling

in.

The irony here is that while
the popular media keeps us

about the lat-
est events in
the Monica
drama, I refuse

Alone on Valentine’s okay

Lauren 5. Hlllman

Columnlst

The upcoming pseudoholiday of
St. Valentine's Day makes me a little
bitter, but not in the way that most
people tend to hate Valentine's Day. I
really don't think there is a problem
with being "single." People should be
happy and comfortable enough with
themselves to spend some time alone
without feeling lonely.

There is a real distinction to be
made here: Alone vs. Lonely. Alone
means without other people. Lonely
means unhappy
about being alone.

I won't mind
being without a sig-
niﬁcant other on
Valentine's Day. But I
am bothered by the
bombardment of
messages from soci-
ety telling me that I
should be upset about
being single on February 14.

From the television commercials
telling me to send a Hallmark card to
everyone I know, to the signs in stores
armouncing Valentine's Day specials,
to The Pitt News telling me about the
plight of local business owners during
the Valentine's Day rush on ﬂowers
(see last year’s Valentine’s issue), I’ve
been hit from every side.

Radio shows center their music
around love and relationships.
Television stations broadcast shows
with Valentine's Day crises. ("Oh, my
word, I forgot a gift for my sweetheart.
I'll stop in this handy convenience
store to see what I can get at the last
minute. A pack of gum? I'll take itl")
And news programs actually gave tips
on how to celebrate Cupid's day
romantically. (One "news" program
even taught me how to take a roman-
tic bath — complete with candles and
sensual scent — as if that's something
I can't ﬁgure out on my own.)

Too many people jump ﬁom one

News 648-7973

relationship right to the next. These
people have been, like me, bombard-
ed by the negative irnages of being
single that society has created
Television shows, popular songs,
movies; they all give stilted images of
love. In most television programs
(barring daytime and evening soap
operas —— those are in a class by them-
selves) people can meet, fall in love,
have a ﬁght and resolve their issues in

’ half an hour and return next week for

more zany adventures. Even in the
most inane action movies (I recall the
1996 Schwartzenegger hit, Eraser)
' with no semblance
of romance in the
plot at all, the hero
gets the girl. Oh,
sure, the plot has its
holes anyway, but
the romance is
believable. I don't
think so.

How many. com-
mercials are aimed
at making us look pleasing to our cur-
rent or yet—to—be signiﬁcant others?
Perfume, cologne, makeup, shampoo,
weight-loss programs, breath mints
— if it makes you more capable of
attracting a mate, you can bet it's being
marketed heavily.

Back to the point (I‘rn sure there
was one, somewhere). Our society
shuns single people. It eschews loners.
Introverts are encouraged to come out
of their shells and to be outgoing.
Have you ever gone to the movies by
yourself? Has the thought ever even
occurred to you? Images pressed upon
us from television, movies and maga-
zines are full of the message that we
should not be alone.

But there is nothing wrong with
being alone, because it doesn't mean
you have to be lonely.

Lauren S. Hillman will be spending
this Valentine’s Day with her closest
ﬁiends, celebrating the fact that she
has them, and thats what counts.

IfI were to ask who was
the most dangerous person
alive right now, what would
you say? It's really no contest.
Saddam Hussein wins, hands
down.

His objectives are unclear,
yet he has no problem sacriﬁc-
ing his people's lives for them.
He follows no rules and
respects no one. He has provid-
ed the world with constant
headaches for years, with a spe-
cial distaste for Americans.
Now, we ﬁnd out that the worst
may still be yet to come. ~

It appears that Hussein is
in possession of a vast arsenal
of chemical and biological
weapons. VV1th these weapons
of mass destruction, it is
believed that Hussein can kill
thousands, even millions of
people anywhere on the planet
at any time he chooses —
today, if he should so desire.

After all, we are surely the ﬁrst
on his hit list.

Well, why don’t we just
kill him? Assassination seems
to be overlooked too often, and
it might just be our best course
of action. ’

Hussein is not like other
world leaders. “He represents
- one of the most dangerous per-
sonality types we know,”
warns Jerrold Post, a George
Washington University psychi-

‘ lyzing terrorists and dictators
(Hussein is both). Post com-
pares Hussein to Hitler because
of his extreme grandiosity,

- absence of conscience, aggres-
sion and paranoia.

where killing can be a humani-

Pros ruin the spirit ofO|ympic

Games, hurt own sport as well

Rachel Lenzi

Columnist

Five years ago I opened the newspa-
per and read in disgust that the Olympics
would be allowing NHL players in the ‘98
Olympics. What was once a pipe dream is
now a reality, so the argument is now upon
us: Should professional athletes be
allowed to participate in Olympic compe-
tition?

No way.

The Olympic spirit is slowly being
destroyed by the inclusion of professional
athletes. What happened to the spirit of the
Olympic Games, when a mere college boy
from Massachusetts got his chance to
dethrone the Russians as the world hockey
power in the 1980 Miracle on Ice? People
around this country still vividly remember
the young Jim Craig skating across the ice,
an American ﬂag draped over his shoul-
ders, asking, “Dad? Where’s my dad?”

What about the guy who has to
become an all-star professional baseball,
basketball or hockey player at the age of 19
to represent his country? What about
women like Carmni Granato and Mia
Hamm, who have no professional league
to hone their skills and rely solely on
intense personal training and amateur
competition? And what about Janet Evans,
who abandoned her Stanford education for
a higher caliber of training?

The spirit of international competition
is based on the amateurs who train and
train for those two weeks held once every
four years: the products of Russian athlet-

ics factories, the speed skaters who rely .

solely on donations to support their
obscure event, and the collegiate phenorns,
some of whom may never have the oppor-
tunity to represent their countries again.

On the ﬂip side, this hurts the profes-
sional teams, too. Consider the collection
of this year’s Olympic hockey teams, each
of which is laden with NHL superstars
such as Wayne Gretzky, Peter Forsberg,
Jaromir Jagr and Chris Chelios.

Should they be representing their
countries in Nagano right now?

Absolutely not.

If I were the general manager of any
NHL club, I’d be cursing NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettrnan for making
such a decision The NHL’s overhyped
winterbreakcomes whenthe26teamsand
their respective managements are gearing
up for playoff runs. The next two months
ofthis seasonarecrucialforteams suchas
the New York Islanders and the Buffalo
Sabres, who are ﬁghting for the ﬁnal spot
in the Eastern Conference playoff pictme.

Not only is a team losing the valuable
momentum that it has built to get this far,
but the 100 or so players are expending

their energy in another country right before
the most crucial point of an NHL season.
It’s make—or-break time for a struggling
team. No one understands the rigors of an
82—garne, night-in-and-night-out schedule,
and no one understands that the playoffs
are an entirely different season.

From the individual's standpoint,
teammates are taking each other on in
international competition. Matt Mento
stated it eloquently in his sports colurrm
earlier this weelc "I wonder if Darius
Kasparitus will take out J aromir J agr’s legs

Back in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics,
America ﬂexed its powerful, worldwide
muscle that enabled it to use the star-stud-
ded NBA Dream Team of Michael Jordan
and friends to blow out the competition and
win the gold

It was America’s nationalism tugging
at its competitive soul that made it pester
the Olympic ’ committee to permit the
inevitable gold for the United States.

And why not, especially after 1988
when a U.S. team of amateurs led by David

two months from

offs.

That brings us to another risk factor:
injuries. A team could lose its marquee
player because of an illegal hit thrown in
international competition. Those general
managers better hope damn well that their
star players don’t get injured, or they can
kiss their Stanley Cup hopes goodbye. ,

Also, the conventional rigors of jet
lag, culture shock and one too many
Japanese rnicrobrews are going to catch up
with each player, oh, say around March 26,
when the San Jose Sharks (who have two
Olympians on their squad) beat out the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks (who have seven
Olympians on their squad) for the ﬁnal
playoff spot. Pierre Page’s excuse for not

making the playoffs? Tired legs. Tired psy- _

che. Fear of ﬂying. Goalie sensation Guy
Hebert chugged one too many Sapporos
that last night in the Olympic Village.‘

Which goes back to the point about “

expending energy for two weeks of what is
essentially exhibition hockey.

So I am hoping that Mark Messier,
who was dissed by the Canadian Olympic
team, is outwardly cursing the IOC powers
that be because right now the Vancouver
Canucks could otherwise be making one
ﬁnal push toward the playoffs and some
poor college kids could be skating for their

many cases, these

had been playing together for several years.
Meanwhile, America's team of college all-
stars had been together for only part of their

, summer break.

The 1988 gold medal Soviet team had
NBA talent in center Arvydas Sabonis, the
current starting center for the Portland
Trailblazers. But he was considered an
amateur because he didn’t play for pay.

_ Or did he? I

A The Soviets and many other countries
alike had state-funded ‘athletic programs.
Players like Sabonis received lavish hous-
ing, the best food in Russia (even if that’s
just McDonald's) and every other accesso-
ry needed to live a first-class life.
Basketball was their only “profession,”
and, because they were good at dropping

' an animal-skin sphere in a 10-foot-high
- hoop, they lived upperclass lives —— much

like professional athletes in the States.

So the U.S. was being penalized by
not being allowed to put its best team on the
court because of a diﬂ’erence in deﬁnitions
of some things that, in reality, were much

. the same: amateurs and professionals.

more about the best athletes in the world
representing their countries and competing
against one another?

Purists say no.

Way back in 1896, when the modem
games began, amateur athletes were purer

and more committed. The pros played for .

money. And there weren’t as many pro
sports way back then, so. there weren’t as
many athletes being kept out of the games.

He was considered an amateur;

When Shaquille O’Neal left LSU for

There is a very thin line between ama-
teur and professional nowadays, and to rule
out one group because it signs a contract
but riot_another is insane and unfair.

The miracle of the U.S. hockey team

in the Olympics was just that, because a
bunch of college players and fringe pros
beat a Soviet team madeup of NI-lI;cal-
iber players. I’m not denying what; a won-
derful and transcending event their victory

'was for the U.S., but something like that

will never happen again because of the
immigration of European players to the
NHL. In the last winter games, the teams
were evenly matched. There were no 30-
year-old world-class players beating up on
17-year-old high schoolers.

Sports are much more global now.
There are professional leagues in every

Single women out there, I hate this
freaking holiday as much as you do.

So, what you should do on February
14? Park your butt in front of the TV and
watch those hot Olympic hockey play-

They are a part of the NHL’s Team

but via modern technology, you can see
the wonders of the world thanks to CBS.

So, as The Pitt News’ NHL corre-

of my crack staff in Nagano — I had to
miss the Olympics to fulﬁll my scholar-
ly obligations) and preview the top hock-

Lady Panthers upset

Last night, down by 17
points to the Pitt Lady Panthers,
the favored Syracuse
Orangewomen began ﬁghting
back. , ‘

Orange forward Paula
Moore, who led her team with
10 points on the night, sliced into
the Panther lane hard, then
pulled up suddenly and drained a
jumper from just inside the foul
line.

Then the Panthers called on
the night’s secret weapon. Pitt
guard/forward Alecia Balich
took a pass just outside the three-
point line, took a quick glance‘ at
the basket, and hit a jump shot
before the entire Syracuse

defense had a chance to set itself. I

When the Orange pushed the

_ ball back upcourt, Balich

slapped the ball out of Raquel
Nurse’s hands and out of
bounds. '

Nurse took the inbounds
pass and attempted a jumper,

P which Balich promptly swatted
back into the Orangewoman’s'

face. It would be the last serious

“She’s realizing that she has
the ability,” Pitt Head Coach
Kirk Bruce said of Balich, who
led the Panthers with 13 points.
“She took her time on some
wide-open shots and canned
some critical ones.”

One of the most "critical
shots Balich hit came late in the
first half, as the Panthers
attempted to extend their lead to
double digits. Taking the ball on
the baseline, Balich attempted to

Pitt Invitational an early test for Panther tennis

Kindra Wykoff
Staff'Writer ‘

While this weekend
may mean candy and ﬂow-
ers for most, it’s time for
the Pitt Invitational for the
women’s tennis team.

The Panthers play six '

different teams in three A

days of nonstop matches.

They will face Buffalo,
Akron, Duquesne, Carnegie
Mellon, Bucknell and
Southwest_Missouri State.

So much for candy and
ﬂowers.

The invitational begins
at 7 p.m. on Friday with
one round of doubles.
Singles will be played
Saturday morning _and
afternoon, beginning at 8
,a.m.',» and a second doubles
round will be held in the
evening. The singles and

young O.LOHd mvlslssv 2nsvN Nvnaa

doubles championships are

I scheduled for Sunday.

Head Coach George
Dieffenbach is looking at
the invitational as another
steppingstone to help the

    

P Panthers improve their Big

East ranking.

“One thing that’s inter-
esting about our team [is
that] for 12 years we were
in last place in the Big East
Conference,” Dieffenbach
said. “Two years ago we
got out of last place, and

last year we” ﬁnished 10th‘

[out of 13]. Our goal this
year is to do better in the
Big East". Ninth would be

good.”

Not only is this week-

p'end‘a good warmup before

‘the start of the
' « spring

conference season, but it
could also give senior Fran
Davis the chance to break a
record. Davis, who has 102
victories to date, can sur-
pass Julie Loprinzi’s 116
victories, a team record set‘

_in 1993. . . 1

“She’s got a_very good .
chance this year to break

Loprinzi’s record,”
Dieffenbach said. “[She is]
Fourteen wins" within tying
it. It’s»a good goal for her.”

The doubles team of
Davis and Erin Shalbrack
set out to defend its title
from last year. "Shalbrack
didn’t,play in the fall due to
an injury but is? ready for
invitational action in sin-
gles and doubles.

Graduate Tamara

' Kalesnik took the lone sin-

gles championship for Pitt
last season. Rather‘ than

The balance beam is only 16 feet
long, four inches wide, and four feet
above the ground. But despite being
just a little more than a foot taller
than the beam, Pitt junior Janet
Highhill can easily do cartwheels,
handsprings, somersaults, and other
unbelievable stunts on it in just a 90-
second routine.

The gymnast has been very suc-
cessful in and out of the gym. In her
freshman year at Pitt she tied a
school record on the uneven bars
with a score of 9.8. This earned her a
seventh-place finish in the all-around
at the University of Michigan Blue-
Gold Cup.

‘Also in her freshman year, she
had an unexpected encounter with
somecelebrities while training in
Trees gym.

“I didn’t believe Lori [a team-
mate] when she said that Woody
Harrelson and Randy Quaid where
playing basketball in the gym next to
where we were practicing,” said
Highhill. “I had to go look for
myself, and they really were there.”

Later during their practice
Harrelson came over to where they
were practicing and watched them
work out. He asked to see them do a

senior year she was the 1995
Michigan state champion on the bars

was a 10th-place finisher in the vault

at the national competition when she
was in the eighth grade.

“I’ve been to regionals every
year since seventh or eighth grade,”
said Highhill.

This is a sign of her strength and
determination, which was apparent
in her decision not to leave gymnas-
tics after her first coach, Phil
Summers, lost interest in the sport in
Highhill’s junior year of high school.

Highhill’s parents left it up to her I

to decide whether she wanted to
remain active in the sport.

“If you don’t want to do it in

recalls her parents telling her.

- She decided to stick it out with
her new coach, John “Fig”
Figeuroua, and she won two state
titles in her senior year. _

When the time came to choose a
college, Highhill narrowed her
choices down to two schools: Pitt or

‘Western Michigan. She chose Pitt to

“Western Michigan was too

toward a good cause.

think I’m quicker than those guys,”
Hawkins said. “My job is to go in and give
the team some enthusiasm and to get the
guys going. I’m also in there to rebound and
help with the scoring.”

So far, he has excelled at both. He has
recorded four double—doubles, including
Sunday’s 19-point, l1—rebound effort
against Boston College.

Willard said it was Hawkins’ play that
eventually clinched the victory for Pitt
against the Eagles.

“I thought that Isaac’s [second—half_|
dunk and then the two free throws were the
key to the game,” Willard said. ‘That got us
back into the game and gave us back our
focus.” "

Hawkins hopes to make it to the NBA
one day. And after basketball, he wants to
get into the music business —— producing
records, not singing on them.

But for now, heis focused on helping
the Panthers to reach the ‘ NCAA
Toumament, a feat that they have not
accomplished since the 1992-93 season.

“We want to make it to the Big Dance,”
he said. “Our goal is to grow and mature as

Basketball injury bug bites all but Lockhart

THE
PITTSBURGH
PLAGUE

The way the
men’s basketball
Panthers are getting
injured, Oakland will
need to build a sixth
hospital soon.

Only one of the 10 scholarship play-
ers on the team has not been hurt at some
point during season — that’s Jarrett
Lockhart.

Not surprisingly, his game has
improved dramatically since the begin-
ning of the season in November.

In eight contests in November and
December, he averaged 8.1 points per
game. But as his teammates began drop-
ping like the proverbial ﬂies, his minutes
have increased a little while his role as a
scoring threat from all over the court has
solidiﬁed. In the new year, he’s scored 15
or more points on eight occasions, includ-

'’ ing the four times he’s broken the 20-

point barrier.

But while Lockhart gets more prac-
tice time and improves, the other nine
Panthers are ﬁghting off the ﬂu, knee
injuries and back trouble.

Sophomore guard Kellii Taylor broke
his foot at a practice in November and
reinjured the “soft tissue” of the same foot
recently.

Freshman forward/center- Kevin

   

Leslie has had continuing problems with
his knees, affecting both his practice time
and his speed on the court.

Highly touted freshman forward
Attila Cosby has experienced back pain
the entire season.

Big East Player of the Year candidate
Vonteego Cummings has played through
the ﬂu and was involved in a freak acci-
dent before last week’s West Virginia
game, bumping heads with teammate
Stephen Flores. V

Flores’ tooth hit Cummings below
the eye, and the point guard received
stitches immediately so that he could play
in that night’s contest. He did play in the
game but scored a mere six points — his
lowest effort of the season — in a 90-72
loss. '

And freshman shooting guard John
Finneman has yet to suit up for a game in
college, following a couple of knee oper-
ations stemming from a torn anterior cru-
ciate ligament suffered his senior year of
high school. C

Considering that the Big East _is
loaded with schools afﬁliated with one
religion or another, it comes as no surprise
that the Panthers have played quite a few
teams with the “”St.”.preﬁx or with reli-
gious ties. St. John’s, St. Bonaventure and

, Notre Dame are just a few of them.

And maybe all these schools’ prayers
have paid off; Pitt’s record against these
schools so far is 3-6. _

Our six losses have come at the hands
of St. Bonaventure (Franciscan), Notre
Dame (Catholic), Providence (Dominican
Fathers), St. John’s (Catholic), Duquesne
(Catholic) and Villanova (Catholic).

We’ve managed to win against St.

Francis (Catholic), Notre Dame and

Boston College (Jesuit Catholic).
Unforttmately, Pitt still has to play
Georgetown (Catholic), and face
Providence and Villanova in rematches.
Against all other schools, the
Panthers are 5-6.

Highhill also has three Pitt top-10

Gymnastics can be a time consum-

Highhill has had some difficulties
with her ankle and wrist this year.

Early in the season she had an MRI on ‘

her wrist, which kept her off the bars in

her first meet.‘ Two weeks ago she‘

Toney ’in a tizzy’loo much for Syracuse WHOOPS   .....m

Freshman point guard shines
in Pil'i’s win over the Orange

Shannon Heim
Staff Writer

The sparks ﬂew dur-
ing last night’s 58-49
Lady ‘Panther basketball
victory over the Syracuse
Orangewomen. But the
real ﬂame was ignited by
one 5—foot-5 freshman.
Monique Toney was on
fire.

No. 24 was every-
where — nothing but net,
rebounds, passes and
assists. Toney was all
over the place, which
was also her major ﬂaw
 she tried to do it all.’

And she did do it all.
The problem was that it
was all in small quanti-
ties. In the first half of
the game, she went 3-for-
7 from the ﬂoor(includ-
ing a three-pointer) to
score seven points. She
led the team in assists
with two, and was tied

— and this was only the
first half.

The second half saw
just as much of the fresh-
man and her ball-control
style. Her routine: She
started with the ball,
dribbled a little, got it
back, and handled it
about another five times
before attempting the
trey  and missing.

Toney attempted
everything. As soon as
Syracuse’s offense had
the ball, she was the first
Lady Panther to be keyed
in on the defense, ready
to block. But because she
was everywhere at once,
she was also not com-
pletely in any place at
one time. Her passes
were too aggressive, and
her attention was divid-
ed.

Pitt Head Coach Kirk
Bruce yelled to her from
the sidelines to stop wor-

  

 -  — Two last-second Syracuse scores put the half- 3

time score at 27-20, but Balich’s energetic play
helped the Panthers keep momentum. After a half-
opening jumper by Teakyta Barnes, Pitt went on a
nine-point rim, starting with a long jumper by
Monique Toney, who had 12 points on the night,
and ending with'Balich’s second three-pointer of
the evening. The run gave the Panthers a 36-22
lead. "

While the offensive output was impressive,
Bruce had a different take on the night’s victory -
the team’s second in the Big East all season. _

“I’m pleased with our defense,” he said. ‘That
Teakyta Bames, she’s a great scorer for them. She
had 10 points. [And] if she has an 0-6 three-point
game-again the rest of the year, I’ll be shocked.”

Barnes wasn’t the only Syracuse player with
trouble behind the arc — the Orangewomen shot
under 12 percent on their three-pointers for the
night, with Nurse hitting the team’s only two long-
distance shots in 17 attempts, Balich personally hit
three three-pointers for_ the Panthers.

While Syracuse’s outside game ‘ slowly fell
apart, the Panther inside game began to take over
the contest. Late inthe half, after Syracuse pulled
within seven points, ﬁeshman forward Kenosha
Chastang sank a layup while surrounded by
Syracuse defenders, giving Pitt a nine-point lead.

Bruce called that basket the critical ﬁeld goal
of the night, and added that Chastang-’s night was
“incredible for a ﬁeshman.”

Chastang ﬁnished with ﬁve ‘blocks, three
assists and 10 points.

rying about shooting and to concen-
trate on the pass, saying she had
‘other teammates who could shoot.

Bruce said, “Mo—Mo [Toney] was
just in a zone tonight. Sometimes she
gets in a tizzy.” He added,
“Sometimes reality isn’t a part of
what she’s thinking about out there.
She just wants to win.”

Even while on the sidelines,
Toney was in the action. Taken out
with 12:49 left to play in the second
half, she talked herself through every
play that took place in front of her.
When the team scored, it was like it
had just shot the winning basket in
the Olympics. The bench was not
warmed in her four total minutes out
of the game. ‘

Toney reentered the game with
just over eight minutes left and went
right back into action. She initiated a
team huddle by herself and seconds
later ran the ball the length of the
court to score a deuce on a perfectly
executed play.

Eight minutes later it was all over
for Toney and her team. She ended
the game with 12 points (behind only
Ba1ich’s 13), tied for first on the team
with three assists, and also 'con-
tributed four rebounds. It was
Toney’s best performance since an
18-point, two-assist game versus
Florida International on Dec. 27.

TEAM FINLAND

I sensed some dissension in the
Finnish camp, so I sent my crack staff
into the Olympic Village to get the low-
down on the Finns. It seems as if Teppo
Numrninen’s reign as the Sexiest Man in
Finland is being threatened by the
Finnish Flash, Teemu Selarme, and big
Teppo is none too pleased. Neither are
his wife, mistress, and that gorgeous
snowboarder chick from Italy he met’ at
the ski lodge last night.

Esa Tikkanen’s got his own agenda.
See, the peskiest man in hockey has this
insane streak of jealousy over the pretti-
est man in hockey, J aromir J agr. Is it over
some beautiful ﬁgure skater? A tiff from
the NHL season? "

Wrong. It’s the hair, baby. The bald-
ing Tikkanen’s plan to find out the secret
of Jaromir’s curly, long locks is slowly
being unfurled. A

TEAM CANADA

More dissension abounds, this time
in Camp Russia. The brothers Bure are

A They shook up the starting lineup in

the fall in a round-robin tournament to
grab the top two spots. Jafarian and
Carlson are definitely the ones to
watch this weekend as they try to
improve on their fall records, which
pushed both of them past Davis in the
team rankings.

“We have a very deep team, [posi-
tions] one through seven, but those
two were just a little bit better,”
Dieffenbach said. “They’re solid play-
ers right now.” —

Dieffenbach’s team -has been
preparing for the spring season, and he
feels confident that the: players are
ready.

“It’s the best team I’ve coached in
terms of mental attitude. They work
hard and are uniﬁed. [They have] a lot
of common goals.” . '

Dieffenbach is quick to point out

that his coaching is not the only reason J

the team is ready to move forward.
“Our strength and conditioning
coaches, Gary Wateska and Brian

‘Fabian, worked a lot with these ath-

letes, and a lot of the improvement in
the team is due to them,” said
Dieffenbach. — ‘

Don’t just think that the teams
only goal is a winning record. It goes
way beyond winning. Dieffenbach is
very proud of his team’s grades. There
are six women on the squad with a

QPA of 3.0 or higher.

“Our first goal is to do well and
graduate everybody,” Dieffenbach
said. “[The] second goal is to compete
hard, have another winning record and
improve performance in the Big East
championships.”

The invitational is the team’s ﬁrst
real test of the spring season.
Dieffenbach is anxious to see whether
the fall and winter conditioning and

‘the fact that the team doesn’t have to’
travel for this tournament will help.

The women’s spring training starts
when their classmates are on break.

This year the team heads to
Carmel Valley, Calif. ,

“We do play four matches while
we’re there, and there’s not as much
academic pressure on the players,”
said Dieffenbach.

The toughest matches, according
to Dieffenbach, are against. Marshall
(which the team plays away next
week), Providence and Villanova. He’s
not dismissing the other schools,
though.

Dieffenbach’s 23 years of coach-
ing experience and the fact that he’s
had a near—.500 record six years in a
row are assets to this team, which is
ready to make a giant leap forward in
the Big East rankings. .

“Pm proud of this team,”
Dieffenbach says, smiling.
