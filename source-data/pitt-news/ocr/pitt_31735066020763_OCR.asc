The 45th White House News
Photographers Association'Annu—
al Exhibition is presently on dis-
play in the William Pitt Union art
gallery.

The exhibit consists of 60
award winning photographs
selected from over 1,200 entries
submitted by members of the as-
sociation.

The photographs cover a broad

variety of subjects, ranging from
sports to medicine to politics.

._,.7Many of these are exceptionally

emotional and graphic illustra-

tions of human life, such as the .

photograph of a group of Haiti-
ans who were ruthlessly gunned
down while waiting in line to
vote in their country's elections,
or the picture of an exhausted
surgeon sitting beside his patient,
moments after a 21-hour heart
transplant operation.

The White House News Pho-
tographers Association» was
founded inlune, 1921 duringthe
administration of President War-
ren G. Harding. Since its forma-
tion, the number o
photographers enrolled in the or-
ganization has grown from an
original 24 members to the
present 500. . '

The photographs were original-
ly judged in a contest format dur-
ing President Franklin D.
Roosevelt’s administration. Dis-
played in the exhibit are award
winning photographs from 12
categories. Winning photographs
are judged on the basis of ”cal—
culation, coordination and posi-
tion," according to Erica Hennig
of Arts Services lnternational.

The exhibit will be on display
at Pitt until Feb. 10. Different
photographs will be shown about
every two weeks, according to
Gregg Roby, the chairman of -the
Pitt Program Council Arts Com-
mittee.

The exhibit is organized by the
Library of Congress in Washing-
ton, D.C., and, circulated by Art
Services International. It is being
presented at Pitt by the PPC Arts
Committee.

’’I didn't think it would be any-
thing like this. I expected some-
thing nice, but I'm really pleased
with these pictures,” Roby said.

The University of Pittsburgh is
the first school’, museum, or insti-
tution to show the exhibit since
its release from the Library of
Congress.

Jon Wells/The Pitt News

By Vince Gadrix
For The Pitt News

Despite the number of times
people have uttered ’’It can never
happen to me,” today's modern
American—culture crime is touch-
ing an ever-increasing number of
people. ,

Whether it is in the city or rural
areas, in an obvious form such as
mugging, or as hidden as ”date
rape,” personal assault is a grow-
ing problem. It can happen to
anyone.

‘ Of course there is no sure way
of preventing personal assault;
however, the philosophy of the
BYAM method of self defense, a
credited course offered here at
the university is that ”the best

protection against crime is to be

prepared.”

The Buy Yourself A Minute
(BYAM) method of self defense is
coordinated by Curtis A. Byam
Smith. Smith is a graduate of the
University of Pittsburgh with a
degree in social sciences.

He is the director of Universal
Professional Training, a police
officer here at the university, and
he is also a martial arts instructor.
Smith has developed the BYAM
method of self defense through

the many years of experience he
had in this profession.

The program's purpose is to
help the individual answer two

_ questions: How can I reducef-tny

chances of becoming a victim,
and what should I do if l am‘ as-
saulted? 
The fnethod’s answer to fthe
first question is ”Be prepared."
Smith explains that being pre-
pared does not imply paranoia
although the program hopes to
develop an ”awareness” within
the individual. ’’What I try to
make you do is understand what
you're up against and how to pre-

. pare for it,” he said.

Ironically, the first steps in the
BYAM method do not involve the
physical aspect of self defense but
rather the psychological aspect,
or, ”street wit. I tell police that
you survive by using your wit and
not your brawn,” Smith said.

The ”street wit” aspect of the
program is what Smith takes
pride in when he distinguishes
his method from others. The
”street wit” is a psychological un-
derstanding that changes with the
environment and the times. ”The
environment is constantly chang-
ing and, like any other profes-
sional area, such as medicine,

  Pitt students turn to self defense

you must keep up and grow with
these changes,” he said. ”That is
the mistake that many people in
the self defense profession make.
They become stagnant.”

The BYAM method answers
the second question in the same
manner. When one is assaulted,
the first levels of response are
psychological, not physical. He
said, ’’I tell my students that the
best defense is talking. The last
level is confrontation, and that is
physical." .

The physical. aspect of self

_ defense is hardly neglected in the

program. On Mondays and Tues-
days between 2:30 and 3:30
p.m., as one approaches the mul-
tipurpose room in Trees Hall, the
sound of a firm and knowledge-
able voice can be heard explain-
ing some aspect of either
”maintaining balance” or ”the
psychology of walking.”

There is a hand clap, and the
18 students in the class, paired
off, proceed to make physical
contact as if in_a personal assault
and then make the appropriate
verbal and physical response,
guided by Smith. ”The progam is
teaching you to turn your fear
into reaction, not fear into panic,
which only aids your attacker-.”

Fire causes
plane crash

LONDON (AP) — Investiga-
tors said Tuesday that one en-
gine of a crashed Boeing 737
had fire damage, while the
other was inexplicably shut
down before the aircraft

plunged into a highway em- -

bankment, killing 44 people.

Fire evidence turned up in
the left-hand engine, although
the pilot of the British Midland
Airways jet had told ground
control it was in the right-hand
engine, Transport Secretary
Paul Channon said.

Aviation experts thought it
unlikely the captain could
have confused the two en-
gines, and one pilot said the
fire warning system may have
been at fault.

- Asked on Independent Tel-

evision News whether" pilot er-

ror might be involved,
Channon said: ’’I don't rule
that out, but it would be un-
wise of me to speculate on that
until we've got more infor-
mation.”

Navy officer caughtselling classified information

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ A re-
tired Navy chief petty officer was
arrested today on charges that he
tried to sell highly classified infor-
mation about anti-submarine
warfare tactics to the Soviet Un-
ion, the FBI said.

Craig D. Kunkle, 39, of Virginia
Beach, Va., was arrested by FBI
agents from the Norfolk, Va., field
office on charges of espionage,
gathering or delivering classified
information to a foreign govern-
ment and disclosure of classified
information, said FBI spokesman
Charles W. Steinmetz.

Steinmetz said the arrest result-
ed from an undercover investiga-
tion by the FBI and the Naval
Investigative Service that began
last month. ”We did stop him
from providing the information”
to the Soviets, he said.

Kunkle, a 12-year veteran of
the Navy who was discharged in
1985, could be given a life sen-
tence if convicted.

A private investigator and secu-
rity guard in the Norfolk area,
Kunkle had served in anti-
submarine squadrons in the Pa-

cific and Atlantic fleets durin_g-hi_s

spokesman said.

Kunk|e’s activities were un-
related to the Norfolk-area spy
ring spearheaded by former naval
officer John Walker, who is serv-
ing a life sentence for selling valu-
able Navy secrets to the Soviets,
Steinmetz said.

Parliament by choosing all 100
candidates for the party's 100

Images Abroad

Beggars seem more dignified in Barcelona

The man, wearing a clean
white shirt and faded trousers,
kneeled on his dusty jacket on
one of the sidewalks in
Barcelona. .

He held a large sign which
read: ’’I have no job. I have no
money. I have a family — two
small children.”

The sign was hand printed
neatly in English —— so the tourists

would understand.

That sign was what had attract-
ed my attention to this Barcelo-
na beggar as I waited on the
corner to meet my friends.

I was used to seeing bums in
the United States huddled on

~ street corners or sprawled out in

alleyways. They usually didn't try
earnestly to beg for money.

Date rape victims
must press Charges

Although Assistant Director of Public Safety Walt Waters
doesn't feel the recent cases of sexual assaults, also known

' as date rape, are indicative of an increase in sex—related

crime, there is definitely something amiss.

Few date rape offenders are punished due to the vague
circumstances of the crime. Victims of date rape fail to
press charges, and the public tends to consider the inci-
dent case closed. Such thinking is dangerous.

Date rape victims are no different than victims of stranger
rape. The difference between the two appears to exist in

the public attitude torward the crime. Society refuses to '

acknowledge that one can be victimized within the frame-

work of a date.

In many cases, the relationship between the victim and
the offender in date rape is defined as friendship and so
interferes with the victim's decision to press charges. Ac-
cording to Waters, even when the victim does press
charges ”it is somewhat difficult to sell it to a jury.”

As in any criminal case, unless the victim presses
charges, the police are unable to safeguard the commu-
nity. The Campus Police cannot be expected to chaper-
one the student body. Therefore, the whole problem of
protection devolves to the individual. Until a victim comes
forth and actually presses charges, nothing can be done
to recognize and curtail this type of crime.

. Only when the number of convictions begins to ac-
cumulate and possible offenders realize the future con-
sequences of their actions, can any progress be made

toward prevention.

eligible professors. Yet, what is

the true secret to finding the per— _

fect class?

For many students, selecting
classes is no different than a
Saturday sale at Kaufmann’s. A
careful undergraduate consumer
will study Pitt's course descrip-

 

tions catalogue, compare prices
and usually search for the best
bargains.

The classes which are typical-
ly in style carry a cheap require-
ment tag. For example, many
students jump at the chance to
enroll in a class advertising the
low cost of only two exams and
one text book. The fulfillment of
CAS requirements can be as af-
fordable as a late-night cram ses-
sion. It appears to be a good deal,
but many frugal students are real-
ly being taken for a ride.

As a graduating senior, 1 real-
ize the price a cheap student is
destined to pay. Many times, I
succumbed tothe temptation of
”blow-off” classes. I researched
the professors who overlooked
one’s attendance and graded with
mercy. I indulged in courses in

Reagan's legacy one of change

Eight years have passed since
Ronald Reagan arrived in

Washington promising many-

things, but with one common
denominator: change.
”We may not run this like a

ANALYSIS

quarter mile, but we're going to
run it,” Reagan said on his first
full day in the job of president.

”We’re going to make some
changes, if for no other reason
than that they have to be made.
The people are waiting for us to
do it.”

He exits this month, with that
promise kept. With his era over
and his presidency a matter for
historians, whatcan be said of the
rest of Reagan's promises? On
what did he deliver, and on what
did he fail? . ~

There are plenty of partisan

opinions. The Democrats even-

published a book cataloging their
view of ' Reagan’s broken
promises four years ago when he
faced re—election.

Reagan swept Democratlimmy
Carter from office in 1980 with a
pledge to improve the economy
at home and to improve Ameri-

students

For me, it may be too late. Yet,
something must be done to block
the spread of a generic education.

Students are not entirely to
blame‘ for conforming to the
quest for an easy A. Some of Pitt's
faculty don't consider college a
teaching experience.‘ Though
these professionals are usually
qualified and successful in their
respected areas, many lack the
desire to challenge their students
beyond a 50-question multiple
choice exam.

Term papers and final exams
don't teach students. It's easy to
regurgitate a professor's lecture
onto six pages of homework.
Many students need only com-
plete book reports to maintain a
B average. Too many times stu-
dents graduate like robots,
programmed with the ideas of
others.

In every area of education, we
learn through discussion. Excep-
tional professors and instructors

ca’s standing abroad. Central to
this goal was a trio of promises:
he would cut taxes, build up the
military and balance the budget.

50 how is two out‘ of three?

Reagan won from the
Democratic Congress a 25 per-
cent reduction in federal income
tax rates. He later engineered a
broad rewrite of thetax laws that
eliminated many deductions in
exchange for reduced tax rates —
all in the name of simplification.

Yet he supported tax increases
too, and followed the 1981 tax
cuts a year later with a $98 bil-
lion tax increase.

The nation's military defenses
grew with infusions of new
money for sophisticated weapons
systems, and his administration
will be remembered for what is
oftencalled the Reagan military
buﬂdup.

It was a buildup, in fact, that
leaves Reagan's successor with
crushing demands for more
money to continue —— so much so
that the ability to prune Pentagon
wish lists was a central factor in
President-elect George Bu.sh’s
-search for a defense secretary.

But it was the federal budget
deficit -where Reagan clearly

failedi Not only did it ‘not become
lower, it mushroomed. The na-
tion, it turned out, could not

generate growth as a result of the

tax c.ut's?sufficient to balance the
budget. And there were no~bud—

"get cuts sufficient to do the job

either.

Reagan's targets for a balanced
federal budget kept getting put
off. He never submitted a

balanced budget to Congress,

and the annual. deficit grew to
nearly $200 billion a year before
starting to head down in his last
years.‘ . .

Democrats love to point out
that the nation's total debt under
Reagan was more than that sus-
tained under all the presidents

before him. Federal debt was un-

der $1 trillion when he took
office in 1981; today it is more
than $2.6 trillion.

But Reagan delivered on much

of his economic promise. Infla-
tion abated. After an early reces— «

sion that helped wring spiraling
prices from the economy, growth
wassteady. lndeed, peace and
prosperity was a powerful argu-
ment for his vice president's cam-
paign to succeed him last fall.

It's easy to’ lecture, for 50

minutes and hope someone is in-
terested. Those that teach talk to
their students and assure them
that all ideas matter, even to
someone holding a Ph.D.

In a school where everyone is
classified as a social security
‘number, Pitt students tend to lose
themselves in a class distribution
curve. They refrain from ques-
tioning authorities and attend
class for the sake of a grade rather
than to learn. .

It's not pointless to establish
comfortable communication with
one’s professor. Though it may
not be a requirement, asking
questions and generating ideas
provides students with the ulti-
mate education inde-
pendence. ' .

Pitt has a‘ fair number of‘

teachers. I recall that in one liter-

ature class, my professor waited
silently for 10 minutes until,
.someone voiced an opinion. I

regret that it wasn't me.
‘The university doesn't require
its faculty to be teachers; it asks

only that they be credited and -

productive academicians. There
is, however, no excuse for docile
student . behavior in the class-

_ room.‘¥'More often, we must raise

a hand‘ above mediocrity and

demonstrate our ability to think.

A 4.0 grade point average isn't

i0.

necessarily a valid or reliable 0

measurement of learning. It is
only a processed score of perfor-
mance by someone else’s
standards.‘

Our minds must be utilized,

not molded. The best classes at .

Pitt are expensive. One“ has to
pay more attention and spend a
greater amount of time thinking.
One may not attain an A, but in

the long run, choosing a costly .

class is a solid investment.

PERSPECTIVE,

THE PITT NEWS

Just when you thought it was
safe to open The Pitt News. Just
when you thought you could eat
your Sausage McMuffin without
being grossed out. Just when you
thought you could actually like
Dan Quayle- Just when you
thought you could wear your cot-
ton Levi Dockers without being
laughed at... Staf is back, and he's
sarcastic as hell. He's pushing his
liberal views and calling people
”buttheads” like never before.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm back. Big
deal. I'm not Geraldo, for God's
sake. I'm only Mark Staf. 4

So anyway, what's new? I no-
tice everyone looks very cute in
his or her Christmas outfits. I saw
a girl this morning who still had
the price tags hanging from her
blouse and jeans. I bet that will
be the style soon, kinda like Min-
nie Pearl. However, the

‘ crumpled-up tissue paper in her
new shoes looked extremely un-

comfortable.
Which reminds me,  you

think that I'm wearing the same
Pitt sweatshirt everyday, you're
wrong. There was a sale at the Pitt
bookstore, and my mother
thought that it was such a steal
that she bought me a gross of
grossly identical sweatshirts for

‘Christmas. I ‘now have a sweat-

shirt for each day of the term. At
least I won't have to do my laun-
dry for another three months.

‘ to get his client off no matter-who

he has to embarrass to do it. Such

‘was the case of Ollie North's at-

torney, who subpoenaed as wit-

nesses President Ronald Reagan,
P_resident-elect George Bush and
Secretary of State George Shultz.
But in an unbelievable Catch 22
situation, the prosecutors asked
that the major charges against
North be dropped because the
White House said the incriminat-

ing evidence that might show‘

North violated national security

 would, if it was made public, en-

danger our national security.
It's a pity the White House
balked because all of us were
hoping Ollie’s trial would finally
reveal what was going on. Be-

sides Reagan and Bush, it was ru-
mored Ollie’s lawyers hoped to
subpoena the Ayatollah Khomei-
ni,
Prime Minister Margaret Thatch-
er, President Francois Mitterrand,
Mickey Mouse and Donald
Duck. ‘

North's attorneys have their
defenders.

”It was necessary for North's
lawyers to do what they did,” an
Ollie supporter told me. ”They
could not defend their client un-
less they had every scrap of paper

the White House produced in the

last eight years."

”Would they have stopped af-
ter calling Donald Duck?”

”Not necessarily. They also
wanted to question Pakistani

The little break that the PAT
bus drivers got from a closed Pitt
was therapeutic. I actually saw,
for the first time in my commut-
ing career, a PAT bus driver
smile.

The break was also beneficial
for the Schenley Cafe in the
WPU. I was down there the other
day, and something actually
smelled good. Itdidn’t-smell like
food, mind you; it just smelled
good. Hey, good is good.

I also noticed the staff down at
the cafe has become a little nicer.
Last Thursday, they threw my
change at me. Usually, they re-
fuse to give me any change at all
and threaten to break all my pen-
cils if I tell anyone.

The cafe may be pretty bad, but ‘

it isn't half as bad as a little dive
on the South Side that I visited
over the Christmas season. This
place is called the 17th -Street
Cafe. The service is good, and the
food is edible, but the fat slob
who owns the place thinks that

were basing their case on the fact
that others hadjto know what
North knew or he would not
have known how to do what he
did.” '
”How did Reagan fit into all
this?” I asked. ”He claimed at the
time he didn't know anything.”
”Maybe he didn't know any-
thing, but Ollieﬂs lawyers intend-
ed to find out when he knew it.
We're not saying that the Presi-
dent was part of the conspiracy,
but somebody must have told
him something about Ollie and
Fawn Hall playing burn bag in
their office. The defense intend-
ed to embarrass the president to
the point where he wouldn't
cooperate, thus making it impos-
sible for Ollie to get a fair trial.”
”Suppose, for argument’s sake,
the President did take the stand.
Wouldn't that have wrecked Ol-
lie’s defense?"
_”Not necessarily. The fact- that

”How could that happen?”

”The CIA’s Bill Casey slipped

desk when Reagan‘ was dozing.

ways signed everything in front of

dealer.”

sent Ollie to Tehran, North could
have been found completely in-

approach if the United States al-
lows them to get away with it.

By far the most astute voice in
the aftermath of the Pan Am
tragedy is that of Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israel's deputy for-
eign minister.

In a Dec. 29 news conference
in. Jerusalem, Netanyahu said,
”There is no such thing as a good
terrorist. All terrorism is bad. The

waragainst terrorism must be in-

divisible. You cannot fight ter-
rorism on one side of the world
and reward it on the other.”
While the Pan Am tragedy is
the most visible manifestation of
terrorism in. recent days, it is not

— the only one. On Dec. 28, Israel

intercepted a squad sent» by a
branch PLO organization, which
had participated in the Palestine
National Council meeting in Alg-
iers where documents that con-
demned terrorism were signed.
lsrael said the terrorists had in-
structions to murder civilians.
Arafat has consistently violated
agreements designed to end ter-
rorism. In 1985, Arafat signed an
agreement in Cairo to stop ter-
rorism against non-Israeli targets.
Military actions were to be con-
fined to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Netanyahu says that ”with-
in four months [Arafat] personal-
ly ordered the Hawari apparatus
to bomb a RNA plane in midair.”
In fact, the PLO .has pioneered
terror in the skies. It was behind
the hijacking of an El Al flight to‘
Algeria in July, 1968. Other
airline targets in the last 20 years

. have included, KLM. Lufthansa,

. ,4.’

Japan Airlines and TWA.

On the ground, the PLO has
also led the way, targeting school
buses, Olympic athletes, diplo-
mats and other innocent civilians.
The PLO has franchised its exper-
tise and helped other groups in
various countries with-their polit-
ical objectives. _

If the investigation reveals that
the bomb planted on’ board the
Pan Am flight was the work of a
terrorist group with ties, however
slim, to the PLO, the incoming
Bush administration ought to im-
mediately suspend talks with the
PLO for the same reason that we
say we won't try to make deals
with the Ayatollah again.

In case we have forgotten what
that reason is, Netanyahu remind-
ed us in his Jerusalem news con-
ference: ”There is no value to
agreements with terrorists like the
PLO. Talking to them will not
stop the onslaught of terrorism,
but increase it.

”The American talks with the
PLO have seriously weakened
the American effort against ter-
rorism and havegiven hope to

‘Minus five

 The 6—foot-2,

Wanke, four others decide to transfer

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer 4

At least five Pitt football play-
ers, including 1988 backup quar-
terback Larry Wanke and two
other QBs, have indicated that
they plan to take their football ta-
lents to other collegiate programs
next season.’ ’ ‘

Wanke, a redshirt sophomore,
was a challenger to Darnell Dick-
erson both years he was on the
Panther squad but-could never
wrestthe starting position away
from the Detroit-born signal-
caller.

”When I went home over
Christmas break, I got to talking
with my parents about my situa-
tion here,” Wanke said. ”I just
told them then that I thought that
it was time to make a move.”

Also expressing displeasure
with their situations were Alex

Hubinger and Steve Aungsi.
”Sometimes what happens is
these guys just want to play rlnor-.’:,
and it doesn't worlr; out," Pitt
head coach Mike Gottfried said
from his hotel room in San Fran-
cisco, where he ‘will coach the

East in the East-West Shrine

Game on Jan. 15.

I95—pound
Wanke was one of the most high-
ly sought—after prep players in the
nation three years ago when he
came out of Benedictine High
School in Cleveland. He was red-
shirted during his first year at Pitt,
then was a backup to Sal Genilla
and then Dickerson after the
former went down with an inju-
ry~in the latter portion of the 1987

-season.

I’. When Dickerson was debilitat-

ed with an ankle injury in the ear-
ly stages of the '87 Bluebonnet
Bowl, Wanke came on to com-
plete I_3 of 27 passes for 230
yards and three touchdowns, in-

cluding 40- and 43-yard bombs

for scores.

Coming into spring practice last
year, Gottfried indicated that
Wanke and Dickerson were go-
ing to battle for the start_er’s posi-
tion. Wanke jumped off to an
early start, as he was given the
”John Michelson Award” as the
most valuable offensive back in
the spring session. I

But when, the time came to
name a starter in fall practice,
Gottfried decided to go with the
quicker Dickerson and«.thus_ an
option attack over Wanke’s clas-
sic drop-back passing style.

Although an early—season sepa-
rated shoulder did not help his
situation, it was that diversified
offensive style which‘ relegated
him to second—string despite an
impressive preseason perfor-
mance, Wanke said.

”He [Gottfried] instituted the
option into the offense — he
made it part of the offense, just

like handing the ball off,” Wanke.

stated. ”l just don’tfit into that
offense. I’m a drop-back passer.
You car: say that E fit in. The

coach can say that i fit in. But i
know in my heart it you're going
to go with the option, you're go-
ing to go with Darnell.”

Because Gottfried has given no
indication that the offense will go
back to "a conventional style_in
this upcoming year, Wanke
thought it best to pack up his
things and move on. T

”If he told me tomorrow that
the whole offense was going to
change and it was going to go
into total drop-back passing, then
I'd say ‘Hey, I've got a definite
shot at the job.’ I think I could
win the job then. ,

"But that's not how it is, and
that's something I’vehad to r‘eck-
on with. I think it's time for me
to go somewhere where I can
throw the ball and play — I want

«to play.”

Wanke moved out of his dorm
and withdrew from his classes
yesterday. He has not officially

down play midway through the
first quarter, San Francisco's

defensive end Larry Roberts:

managed to get a couple of
fingers on Wilson's shoe, so
Markbreit blew the whistle when
he should have swallowed it. A
huge gain on a flair pass to full-
back Rick Fenney was nullified,
and so yyas Minnesota's
momentum. ' -
Markbreit’s intentional ground-
ing calls on Wilson in the playoff

‘game were nearly as horrible.

THE Pl'lT‘NEWS, Wednesday, January ll, 1989

Van Slyke prepared to go to arbitration

, (AP) -— All-Star outfielder Andy
Van Slyke apparently will not get

. the three-year contract he is seek-

ing from the Pittsburgh Pirates
and will probably file for salary
arbitration next week.

Van Slyke, The Sporting News’
National League Player of the
Year last season after hitting .288
with 25 home runs and 100 runs
batted in, wants a contract simi-
lar to the three-year, $5.5 million

$

deal the New York Mets gave
outfielder Kevin McReynolds.

The Pirates have a history of
settling their arbitration cases be-
fore hearings are required, but
Pirates General Manager Larry
Doughty said, ’’I’d say it's 50-50
he [Van Slyke] will go to ar-
bitration.”

Van Slyke, who can become a
free agent next year, said, ’’If
there's a 50-50 chance of me 20-

there's a greater than 50-50
chance the Pirates can kiss me

”My first priority is to stay in

Pittsburgh Press. ”| feel more ob-
ligated to the Pirates than I ever

But Van Slyke, traded by the
Cardinals to Pittsburgh in April
1987, has hinted he won't remain
a Pirate in 1990 ifthe fiscally con-
servative Pirates don’t make a
competitive offer. _

Nine other Pirates are eligible

for salary arbitration — third base-.

man Bobby Bonilla, first baseman
Sid Bream, catcher Mike LaVal—
liere, shortstop Rafael Belliard,
outfielder R.J. Reynolds and
pitchers Jeff Robinson, Brian Fish-
er, Bob Kipper and Bill Krueger
— but Doughty has done little
negotiating since making contract
offers to them Dec. 20.

Players must file for arbitration
by Monday, and each side will
then have three days to deter-
mine the salary figure it will seek
in arbitration. If the two sides
don't settle before hearings are
held, an arbitrator will choose be-'
tween the two figures.

Houston Astros president, to pre-
pare their arbitration cases. The
Pirates’ strategy has been to do as
little negotiating as possible to
keep the players and agents
guessing about their arbitration
offer.

’’I believe they’re waiting for
Andy to sign before they deal
with me,” Bonilla said.

Bonilla, the National League's
All-Star third baseman, had 24

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January ll, l989_

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer I

The Pitt wrestling team is gear-
ing up for its first dual meet of the
season, against Nebraska (I—O—I ),
the 14th-ranked team in the na-
tion according to the Amateur
Wrestling News poll.

According to the same source,
Pitt is ranked 13th.

The two teams will meet Thurs-
day at 7:30 p.m. at Greensburg—

i;5Salem High School.

Pitt head coach Rande Stott-
lemyer said his team is ready for
the upcoming challenge. Pitt has
traveled to four different tourna-
ments (the Ohio Open, Lock
Haven Invitational, Las Vegas In-

’ vitational and the Midlands

Wrestling Championship) during
their preseason, placing respect-
ably in all of them. .

"We're ready. We're tired of

tournaments now,” Stottlemyer
said. "We’re ready for a dual
meet, to go head—to—head with
somebody and see how we do.
I feel good about our lineup; we
match up well in some weights.
It will probably be close and
tough. We're jumping into the
frying pan with this team.1.",./i"'i

Nebraska is strong in all weight
classes, according to Stottlemyer.
Specifically, they havelason Kel-
ber at 126 pounds (ranked 10th
nationally). I

Pitt was riddled with injuries
during the preseason, but Jeff
Turner, considered to be a major
asset to the team, has returned af-
ter a bout with a knee injury.

Redshiirt transfer Lance Markel

. (I 77) will be in the lineup Thurs-

day night, and Stottlemyer is

Consistent, smart wrestling will

Everybody has got to go out there

"We can't afford to screw up
either. One guy can't go out there
and really lose big. If anything,
we've got to have one guy come
through for us in a really big
way,” Stottlemyer said.

Pitt wrestler Scott Hovan shares
Stottlemyer’s optimism about the
upcoming meet. He feels that no
one in Nebraska's lineup can be
classified as an easy win, but by
the same token, no one wearing
the blue and gold will be easy
pickin’s either.

Hovan said.

Added Stottlemyer: "All you
have to do is look at the Pitt-

week. What's on paper,doesn't

tion [across]. It's what you do out
there between the white lines -

Swim team getting ready for PS

By Scott Campbell

Staff Writer

Pitt meets Penn State again this
weekend in yet another battle be-
tween the rival universities for
athletic bragging rights. This time
around, the battlefield takes the
form of a swimming pool when
the Pitt men's swimming and div-
ing team will compete against the
Nittany Lions at Trees Pool on
Saturday.

”This is a big meet. For brag-
ging rights of Pennsylvania, it's al-
ways Pitt and Penn State, no
matter what sport it is,” said
men's swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw.

Pitt lost to Penn State for the
first time under Bradshaw's direc-
tion last year, both in a dual meet
and at the Eastern Seaboard
Championships, so Bradshaw
made changes to keep the Pitt
program from falling off. He
brought in his largest and best
recruiting class ever for this
season.

”We have a different team this
year. We didn't have the depth
last year. We have a much

stronger freshman class and a
stronger team, depthwise, so we
have a better chance at winning
the meet this year,” said
Bradshaw.

”Last year [their team was]
probably the best men's team that
Penn State ever had, and they're
pretty much the same team this
yean

”To start to build momentum
for the last part of the season, a
victory against Penn State would
be very good for the swimmers.

”The meet might come down

the relays. If both teams are

down to how much depth we
have in the relays. Team depth is
definitely going to play a part in
this. It's’ not just going to be the
event winners, it's going to be
everybody on both teams that is
going to be the difference,” said
Bradshaw.

’’I think the key to this meet is
that if we can beat them in a dual
meet, then we have the psycho-
logical edge when we go to the
Eastern Seaboards this year. If we
don't, I think it's going to be a lit-
tle harder to beat them,” said
Bradshaw.

The Panthers are in a hard
training cycle for about four more
weeks and then will begin to

.shave and taper in time for the

championships.

”We could shave and taper for _

this meet, but after all, people
remember how many champion-
ships you win, not how many
dual meets you win,” said
Bradshaw.

Testimony to their training is
the fact that all the swimmers
continued to train even over the
first half of Christmas break.

”They probably swam harder

than in previous years at home,
on their own, so they came back
in really great shape for Puerto
Rico [Championships, in which
Pitt swam after Christmas].

”Normally, you have a lot of
injuries, "because people go home
and rest, but we had very few,”
said Bradshaw.

Pitt crushed Bowdoin, 135-76,
and Holy Cross, 135-44, at Puer-
to Rico, a relay meet. The Pan-
thers finished first and second in
every race, tuning up for the Nit-
tany Lions.

The Penn State meet will be the
last home dual meet this year.
The team still has road meets at
West Virginia and Villanova be-
fore the championship meets
begin.
