Republic of Ghana President
Jerry John Rawlings silenced a
room of Pittsburghers Thursday
when he told them that if he held
sole executive power in his coun-
try, he wouldn’t build schools or

. clinics —— he’d build a stadium.

He used this wry anecdote to
illustrate why democracy, not
autocracy, is the best form of gov-
ernment for Ghana.

Rawlings told a crowd of Pitt
students, faculty and community
members at the Twentieth Century
Club in Oakland that by fostering
democracy, free enterprise, eco-
nomic growth, the empowerment
of women and rural development,
Ghana has become a model upon

McDonald’s is giving away two
cars to celebrate the birthday of the Big
Mac, invented 30 years ago in
Pittsburgh.

' Wouldn’t itibe an amazing coinci-
dence if a Pittsburgh resident won one
of the ﬁve grand prizes — a 1968 and a
1998 Volkswagen Beetle?

Surprise! The ﬁrst winner is Pitt
senior J onella Gavin, who last Monday
morning peeled the winning ticket from

McDonald’s on Forbes‘ Avenue in
Oakland.

“If she officially wins the grand
prize, it will be a great thing for the city
of Pittsburgh and for her,” said Doug
Stanley, the manager of the
McDonald’s. , _ — -

Stanley made sure to emphasize
the “if” because McDonald’s must con-
ﬁrm the winning game piece, a process
which, according to McDonald’s
spokeswoman Joanne Jacobs, will take

the side of her large orange juice at the _

between three and four weeks.
Jacobs said that in this particular
game, McDonald’s had no ‘idea where

the winning game pieces were sent.,Ini

the McDonald’s Monopoly game, some
pieces are completely random and the
others are put in trucks headed toward
speciﬁc regions of the country.

Her reaction to the Pittsburgh con-
nection of the grand—prize winner: “It
was totally random, but it is kind of
neat!” .

So when Gavin persuaded one of
her friends to have breakfast with her at
McDonald’s around 8:15 a.m. Monday
morning, nobody had any idea what
was about to happen.

“I didn’t even know about the
game,” Gavin said. “I never even gota
McDonald’s breakfast before.”

She certainly picked a good time to
be one of the “billions and billions
served” and order her first Egg

orange juice.

in 1981 by a military coup, has
steered his country towards

democracy and a free—market sys-

tem. Ghana boasts an average of 5
percent armual increase in gross
domestic product for the past
decade.

“Our aim is to consolidate our
gains and create a benevolent
environment to improve the stan-
dard of living of our people,” he
added. “One of our goals is the
elimination of poverty in our
land.”

Rawlings explained how
political stability was brought
about in Ghana. By creating 110

regional districts prior to the elec-»

tions in 1992, the people of Ghana
were able to “encourage grass-
roots participation in a constitu-
tional government,” he said.

However, he expressed dis-
may at current global market con-
ditions, particularly the low price
of certain commodities.

“There is a gold rush going on
in Ghana at the moment,” he said.
“Last year, Ghana produced 2.1

million ounces. The plummeting
gold prices have denied us the
beneﬁts of our hard wor .”

Ghana is the place for foreign
investors in Africa, according to
Rawlings.

But he said if African nations
are to be competitive in the global
economy, fairer trading conditions
and higher prices for exports ——
particularly raw goods such as
gold and oil — are needed.

“We are hoping for a more
equitable global market econo-
my,” he said. “But we’re waiting
with baited breath.” ’

Rawlings gave praise to his
wife, Nana Konadu Agyennan
Rawlings, by saying that she has
done much to" further women
politically, economically, socially
and culturally in Ghana.

He also expressed concern for
the stability in the West African
region and discussed how,

African Unity, Ghana took a piv-

A First Oakland Bazaar fails to draw crowd

Isadora Murphy

Staff Writer

Oakland—area bar and restaurant
owners’ first attempt at an Oakland
Festival succumbed to poor advertis-
ing and high costs Saturday despite
their efforts and a $2 cover charge.

“It kind of sucks,” said Nicole
Siriano at the festival, “but I love
the bands.” i

. Siriano, a high school student
from Fox Chapel, came to. Oakland
to see the bands play.

Beehive co—owner Scott Kramer
said the event cost $10,000 to
$12,000.

Although the bars didn’t break
even, they were able to give some
money to a local charity.

Beehive co—owner Steve Zomoff
said the Oakland bazaar raised at
least $1,000 for Pittsburgh Cares, a

volunteer organization in charge of

placing volunteers where they are
most needed. A

Kramer said he wants to have the
festival next year and do it more
than once.

“For the first one, we thought it
was very successful,” he said “I

thought it was one of the best events,

we’ve had in Oakland.”
C.J.Barney’s, Fuel & Fuddlc,

Peter’s Pub and the Next Decade

also sponsored the event, along with

‘The X at 105.9, In Pittsburgh

Newsweekly and Miller Brewing Co.

Next Decade owner Brett -Dean’

started the day with optimism.
“It being the first year, we’re_ all
kind of hopeful,” he said. “People

are tired of going to the South Side,
so we are trying to get things back in
Oakland.” ‘

But after the event, his wife,

Tracy Dean, wished for better~

crowds and even vendors.

Most would agree the festivali
had a great lineup of bands —*
including Crisis Car, The Sydneys,
Andrew The Impaled and headliner
Mob Town Beat, a Baltimore ska
band. The bands playedfrom 2 to 10
p.m. But aside from the music, there
wasn’t much else to do, attendees
said.

Miller Brewing Co. provided
attendees 21 and over with plenty to,‘
drink for a small cost, but there
weren’t many people there to drink
it. 1 ' :

“We had planned to involve.
business and set up vendors,”
Kramer said. “But the city didn’t
give us permission until two weeks:
before. They kind of screwed up by
giving us‘ the OK [at the] last
minute.” v

Another reason for lack of inter-
est, besides no food or activities,‘
was the lack of advertising. Most‘
students, who make up a large part
of the Oakland community, didn’t
know about the event.

“The Oakland what?” said Pitt
student Missi Onyszki.

David Namestnik, manager at‘
Peters Pub, thought students would
be more spontaneous and just come
as they heard the music.

As the day went on, a few more 5

people filtered in-, but not enough to 
raise asignificant amount of money. 4

Each year, 2 million people —

‘ of which 200,000 are children‘ —-

suffer from these diseases. Crohn’s
disease, which is incurable,
inflames the small and large
intestines, causing diarrhea, abdom-
inal cramps, weight loss and other
discomforts. 
Colitis attacks the large intes-
tine and colon, causing symptoms
similar to those of Crohn’s disease.
The only cure is to remove the
colon. Anyone is susceptible, and
thereare 30,000 cases diagnosed
each year, averaging 82 daily.
“These are diseases that people
don’t want to talk about,” said Joy

Jenko, executive director of the
CCFA.

“It’s not a glamorous disease.’

No one wants to talk about intesti-
nal disease,” added event co—chair
Stu Cohen, who suffers from
Crohn’s disease. ‘
' The lack of publicity and atten-
tion could be one reason why only
150 people. attended the CCFA’s
walk and while 3,000 others attend-

Foundation’s fund-raising walk,
which took place a couple blocks

. Recent welfare reform legislation is
biased and will not address the real prob-
lerns, such as availability of jobs to
unskilled workers, a national welfare expert
asserted in a speech at Pitt. .

“The bill is based on stereotypical con-
ceptions of the welfare recipient as an indi-
vidual lacking in work ethic and family val-
ues,” said Yeheskel Hasenfeld of UCLA
School of Public Policy. Hasenfeld spoke at
the 60th anniversary celebration of Pitt’s
School of Social Work, held in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom Thursday night.

Hasenfeld was talking about the
Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Act of 1996, a law passed in
an effort to reform the welfare system The
act replaced several other programs by giv-
ing individual states block grants of money,
leaving the states with the responsibility to

» dispense assistance to needy families at

their discretion. Needy families are no
longer automatically entitled to assistance.
The legislation also limits the length of

P time recipients can receive aid to a total of

ﬁve years and stipulates that recipients
must have a job by the end of their second
year of assistance. - , ‘

The bill passed witha greatdealof fan-
fare and support.

But Hasenfeld said many states have
historically implemented policies that ulti-
mately worsen the condition of poor fami-
lies.

In reality, he said, welfare recipients
constitute a varied population of people
with diverse circumstances and problems.

Hasenfeld said there are statistics that
disprove the stereotype of welfare recipi-
ents as lazy and that those statistics demon-
strate the great diversity that exists among

the people receiving aid From 50 to 69 per-
cent of women who ever receive welfare
exit the program by getting a job, he said.
The problem, Hasenfeld said, is that 40 per-
cent of those women return to welfare with-
in three years and two-thirds retum within
ﬁve years. ‘

“Many single mothers use welfare as
an income packaging strategy,” he said.

Hasenfeld said he believes that the
solutions offered in the law do not ﬁt the
problem. ,

“The problem isn’t work ethic, but job
type,” he said

Mandatory work requirements and
time limits will not remedy the problems of

unskilled laborers, such as low wages and a
lack of opportunities for advancement,
Hasenfeld said.

The negative impact of these misguid-
ed solutions can be seen in the work of

social services. employees, who are‘ being ,

diverted from their task of providing poor
families with the basic resources they need
to cope with difficult circumstances, he
said ' P

f‘Preoccupation with rules and threats V

to enforce compliance hinder the develop-
ment of a t11.1sti_ng relationship between
client and caseworker,” Hasenfeld said

Hasenfeld found the new welfare
department that tried to both mandate
employment and provide social services
failed on the social services end

He pointed out the elements of altema—
tive programs that show promise in
enabling the poor to attain a better level of
employment and reform low-wage work.

“They all have three common charac-
teristics —— they are voluntary, they are
available to all poor people, and they exist
outside the domain of the welfare depart-
ment,” Hasenfeld said.

I.el- the kids play Iurll

Some folks in New Jersey are suing
a neighbor for building his son a Major-
League—size baseball ﬁeld in his back-
yard. ’

One more time: Americans  are
suing another American  for playing
baseball ' in the backyard

Presumably, the town will ﬁle suit
when Bill Ingraharn, the entrepreneur
recently rrrade rich by his postage—label
business, ﬂies his Stars and Stripes next
July. After all, in an old-money town

like Tewksbury, N.J., tl1ere’s nothing V

worse than the nouveau-riche chump
moving in next door and ﬂashing his
baseball ﬁeld all over the place.

So it looks like the blue-blooded
neighbors stirred things up to spook the
new guy because he doesn’t ﬁt in. The
town without a single Little League ﬁeld
decided to go to court to keep it that
way. ~

Zoning problems, along with com-
plaints of too much cheering during
weekend pickup, games, too much traf-
ﬁc from players and ﬁiends, and the too-
loud “tink” of the aluminum bats threat-

’ en Ingraham’s ﬁeld.

Since his snobby neighbors began
whining, Ingraham has been forced to
follow court-ordered rules; no more
than four children under age 13 at one
time; no games, just practice; no cheer-
leaders; no baseball on Sundays; no
more than two adults and Ingraham on
the ﬁeld at once; and no aluminum bats.

How much more need he cooper-
ate? Besides, Americans are always cry-
ing for more wholesome activities to

keep kids away from gangs and drugs.
Baseball! And on top of that, you’d
think this selﬁsh community would wel-

come a baseball ﬁeld for the neighbor— , 

hood, especially if the taxpayers didn’t

have to pull out their Checkbooks.
Iflngraham wanted to build an 18-
hole golf course open only to his neigh-
bors, it’s doubtful anyone would protest
- Ingralrarn has already done enough

to meet his neighbors halfway, but per- - »

haps to appease them more, he could
build a small parking lot and put some
trees behind left ﬁeld, where his closest
neighbor complains of the crowds.
Other than that, it’s hard to see how
these Communists can blow their noses
using the ideals with which the framers
wrote the Constitution — and have the
Tewksbury govemment on their side.

' This man is America He’s made his for-
. tune, and he’s spent part of it on baseball
with friends in his own backyard, his

private property. And unlike his gener-
ous neighbors, who would undoubtedly
like to charge kids a dollar per inning,
Ingraham is sharing his wealth and let-

5 ting the kids play for free.

Ingraham’s lawyer has estimated
that both sides have spent about $30,000
on this case so far. That’s $30,000 to
make sure the kids of Tewksbury can’t
play baseball. Thirty grand buys a lot of
uniforms, helmets, balls and bats.

Whatever Ing1'aham’s neighbors
want ﬂreir new anti-baseball law to read,
it’s sure to include’ provisions against
selling apple pies at the local grocery
store. .

Let me be blunt: Ilhcrte politicians 

I couldn’.t help but notice the insert in The
Pitt News a few weeks ago from “Beyond the
Wall: Five Years of Ads as Art,” which offered
“commemorative posters” of said ads at inﬂat-
ed prices. Not only do advertisers saturate the
culture with their plugs for products that no one
wants, tlrey’ve now undertaken to sell us the
ads. It’s enough to make one hope that at least
one of Lenin’s predictions will come true: that
the capitalist will sell you the rope to hang him
with.

Another event that week was more affect-
ing. Having spent most of a weekend in bed
with the ﬂu, I found myself strangely cured (not
to mention spiritually buoyed) at the news of
George Wallace’s death. Needless to say, I was
moved to further reﬂection now that Wallace
had ﬁnally departed for that
Segregated Lunch Counter in the
Great Beyond: Who will be next?

In terms of seniority, Strom
Thurmond —_ still slithering about
the Capitol in his crusty senility —
is long overdue for some serious bucket-kick-
ing. Fifty years ago, Thurmond was in the
midst of a third~party presidential run because
Northern Democrats had the temerity to favor
desegregation of the army and a pill against
lynching. . '

Thurmond, like Wallace, was allowed to
issue a vapid “apology” before resuming a
career in_ crassly opportunistic reactionary poli-
tics. Unlike Wallace, however, 'I'hurrnond‘was
never shot, so we are presumably cursed with
his active presence on the political scene_- until
he has the good sense to keel over.

The reactionaries are easy to pick on, of
course. Nearly as stomach-turning are the liber-
als, who on most topics — but especially on
this one —— remember history as well as a moth
that repeatedly bumps its head against a pane of
glass. No doubt many liberals sincerely per-
ceive federal agents’ role in civil rights akin to

that portrayed in the movie “Mississippi

Burning,” where crusading FBI agents relent-
lessly seek justice in deﬁance of the murderous
crackers.

Martin Luther King Jr. — whom the FBI
attempted to blackmail into suicide — no doubt

had a different View. So did the rank—and-ﬁle of

the civil rights movement generally, as is attest- *

ed by a poster that hung in civil rights oﬂices
during the Mississippi Freedom Summer:
“There’s a street in Itta Bena called Freedom.
There’s a town in Mississippi called Liberty.
There’s a department in Washington called
Justice.” -

-And this was during the Johnson adminis-
tration, which was considerably more sympa-
thetic to civil rights than the administration of
Johnson’s much-ballyhooed predecessor. Yet
liberals see the civil rights movement as a Iri-
umph of liberal managerialism infused with
“Kennedy idealism”: In the liberal mindset,
civil rights activists were simply deployed by
John Kennedy as part of the wondrous “New
Frontier” that he was planning.

different from this liberal fantasy
to “lose the South” — authorized

the tapping of King’s phone and
sought to reign in the popular demo-

cratic forces unleashed by a vast movement of ~

ordinary people.

The real Kennedy legacy on civil
rights can be summed up in the events leading
up to the notoriously staged “confrontation” at
the schoolhouse door. After JFK had been pres-

sured against his will to do the right thing and A _

send in the troops, his attomeyp general -
brother Robert — haggled with the vile
Wallace over every detail of the coming event,
insuring that a veneer of principle would cover

the decidedly unprincipled actions of both ,
politicians. . - A

As Gore Vidal has pointed out, the only
“New Frontier” Kennedy ever explored was
Vietnam. I would add that although the region
had already had a going-over by the colonial
French, Kennedy and his successors pioneered
even more thorough methods of “Indian-
killing” on that Frontier.

All of which makes one apprehensive
about where Bill Clinton is planning to buil
his “bridge to the 21st century.” -

HELP REWARD EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING.’

Nominations are being solicited for this University-
wide award for distinguished teaching that is given
annually to full-time faculty who have taught at the
University for at least ﬁve years. Nominations can
be made by individuals or groups of faculty or
students. If there is a teacher whose excellence you
6 would like to recognize, please submit a letter of
nomination to the CDTA Selection Committee, c/o
Dr. Jack Daniel, 801 C.L., by October) 5, 1998.
Your letter should specify the reasons why you feel
the teacher deserves this recognition. A committee
of faculty and students appointed by the Provost will
review the nomination letters and materials submit-
ted by the nominees and will select up to ﬁve persons
to be honored. For more information call 4-6440.

Beware of cults that pose as Christian groups

In an informational pamphlet,
REVEAL states, “Kip McKean also ﬁrst
formulated the trademark ICC doctrine of
‘Baptism as a Disciple’ — the teaching
that one must both fully understand the
purpose of baptism and have fully com-
mitted to following Christ and obeying
the leaders in the Church (the two were
seen as synonymous) in order for his bap-
tism to be valid. Those who had not been
baptized in accordance with this under-
standing of baptism were no longer con-
sidered to be Christian.”

The ICC disguises its agenda by
indoctrinating prospective members at
“fun” activities. A party held by the ICC is
an opportunity to snare members. The
group lures you in, but it’s extremely dif-
ﬁcult to get back out.

Shonna, a friend of mine who was
involved with the ICC, told me about the
ICC’s grip on its members. She said that
she was told what she calls! and could not
do. She told me how one member told her
she would go to hell for smoking. Another
questioned Shonna about her love life and
said she could only date guys the ICC
deemed appropriate. She was told that she
had to miss work because it conﬂicted
with ICC church schedule.

The ICC concentrates heavily on
what it calls BibleTalk discussions that
are carefully structured to persuade new-
comers that they are not Christian and that
they can only become a Christian through
the ICC’s saving methods.

If you are not careful, the ICC will try
to rule your life by telling you whom you
can date, whom you can hang out with,

‘ where your money should go, etc. It also

has a tendency of making you feel guilty
if you do not consider the church more
important than family needs or jobs.

‘ The sad thing is that ICC members
seem to be the friendliest people when
they approach you, but behind that mask
of friendliness hides the wolf in sheep’s
clothing. It surfaces when they start teach-
ing their perverted interpretation of the
Bible. Once you give them your alle-

because they will have you in their clutch-

It is time that the ICC is exposed as a
cult here in Pittsburgh. If you have been in
contact with these people, you may have
made the mistake of associating them
with the Christian fellowships on campus.
Don’t be fooled. The registered student
Christian fellowships on campus won’t
treat you as one of their projects; they will
befriend you in Christ as they serve you.

Below are seven indications that a ‘

group is a cult, according to Boston
University’s chaplain’s office:

1. The group is completely preoccu-
pied with meetings and recruiting.

2. The group demands allegiance
before family, school and interests.

3. The group is vague about its state-
ment of beliefs until you join. .

4. The group requires unconditional
obedience to the leader’s ways. .

5. The group says its leader has ‘spe-
cial spiritual power over others.

6. The group changes your sleeping
and eating patterns.

7. The group tries to keep you in situ- -
ations where you are dependent on the ’

group.

If any Christian group you joined has
characteristics like those stated above, it is
not the group for you.-

Ramesh C. Reddy believes humans are
not religious projects to be completed, but
persons to be loved unconditionally.

Baseball's great
  1998 comes to
a close  

Maybe it’s just that we happen to
reside in Pittsburgh, a football town
by nature. Certainly it’s been com-
pounded by the way the Pirates stunk
up’ the tri-state area over the last
month of the season. Whatever the
reason, one of the most exciting
Major League Baseball seasons in
recent memory concluded yesterday,
and few people around here seem to
have noticed.

Yes, people from here to Siberia ‘

have seen the exploits of Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa. But
there’s been so much more to this sea-
son. ‘ _

For starters, there’s the National
League wild-card race. I’ve always
been fascinated by baseball’s pennant
races. In other sports, it’s not uncom-
mon for teams to ﬁnish a season near-

. ly undefeated or nearly winless. By

the end of a season, there is a clear
separation of the good from the bad.

Baseball teams play twice as
many games as teams in any other
sport. There's plenty of time for teams
to prove themselves and spread out in
the standings. But every year, that
fails to happen. There are teams that,
even after 162 games, still have iden-
tical records. This year, going into the
ﬁnal day of the season, the Mets, the
Cubs and the Giants were all within
one game of each other, still ﬁghting
for the ﬁnal playoff spot.

No matter which of these teams
wins the wild card spot, the National
League playoffs promise to be excit-
ing. The Braves still have to be con-
sidered the favorite, but it wouldn’t be
a shock if any of the playoff teams go

on to the World Series. And on the '

way, we’ll get to see things like Greg

Maddux pitching against Randy

Johnson.

Even though the votes for

National League Most Valuable-

Player won't be tallied for a -few
months yet, there promises to be ram-
pant speculation until the winner is
announced. Most people seem to
believe the award belongs to Sosa,
and that’s certainly a justiﬁable opin-
ion. But could you really argue with
anybody who votes for McGwire, the
modern day American hero,‘ who sin-
gle-handedly put thousands of fans in
stadiums across the country? Or how
about San Diego closer Trevor

BLACKSBURG, Va. —
Mistake after mistake after mistake
equalled sloppy play for the
immovable Pitt oﬁense-that man-
aged only seven points against the
Virginia Tech Hokies in Saturday’s
27-7 loss. ,.

After the poorest of offensive
performances in the ﬁrst half, Pitt
had a chance to redeem itself early
in the second half. Following a
fumble by Virginia Tech quarter-
back Dave Meyer, Pitt had a chance
to cut into the Hokie lead and
change the momentum of the

game. , _
That i didn’t happen. The
Panther drive started at the Tech 12-

yard line-and ﬁnished at the 20-
yard line. That’s right, Pitt went
backward. .
A Matt Lytle completion to
Latef Grim put Pitt at the 4-yard
line and a roughing—the-passer
penalty moved the ball to the '2-
yard line for a ﬁrst-and-goal. But
three consecutive rushing plays that
totaled minus .7 yards forced Pitt to
attempt a 26-yard ﬁeld goal.
Attempt is the key word
because Virginia Tech’s superior

Corey Moore blocked the kick.
The ball fell in the end zone and
resulted in a touchback for the
Hokies. Including a blocked punt
in the game, Virginia Tech now has
six blocked kicks against Pitt and
at least two against every other
team in the Big East since joining
the conference in 1991.

“That should have been a TD.
They stepped it up, and we didn’t,”
said coach Walt Harris.

It wasn't surprising that
Moore was the one to block the
kick because he seemed to make
an impact in every defensive play.
In fact, he had four sacks and eight
total tackles on a defense that
wreak havoc all game long. The
Tech defense as a whole seemed
like it was in the backﬁeld more
than the Pitt rtmning backs were. A
tenacious attack led to nine sacks
and many more hits on the Panther

Add those nine sacks to the

As Pitt lostthis weekend at
Virginia Tech, the rest of the Big

Eastnwas busy at work trying to clear .

up the muddled race for the top of
the conference. Here éis a recap of
the weekend’s action:

¢

Boston College at Louisville

The Louisville Cardinals handed
Boston College (3-1, 2-0) its first
loss of the season with a 52-28
stomping Saturday. Cardinal quarter-
back Chris Redman "was unstoppable
as he threw for 362 yards and had
five touchdowns. While the offense
piled up 509 yards, the defense

forced four turnovers to thwart BC’s

chances of a comeback.

Temple at Maryland

Temple (0-4', 0-1-) and new head
coach Bobby‘ Wallace will have to
wait another week for their first vic-
tory of the season after losing to

Maryland on" Saturday, 30-20. All

fourth quarter when Lamont Jordan

West Virginia and Rutgers win ibig weel(e

Temple’s hopes.

Army at Rutgers

A surprising 27-15 upset by the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights over Army
gave Rutgers two wins for the sea-
son, which equals coach Terry Shea’s
winning total in his 22 games at
Rutgers prior to this season. Two
touchdown runs by Gary Fauntleroy
gave Rutgers (2-2, 0-2) an early 14-0
lead, and an interception return for a
touchdown by cornerback Reggie
Stephens helped the Scarlet Knights
build a commanding 21-12 lead.

Tulsa at West Virginia

Trailing 14-13 with 1:06 to go in
the first half, West Virginia (2-1, 0-0)
drove 60 yards thanks to quarterback
Marc Bulger’s six pass completions
on six attempts — including a 1-yard
touchdown pass to Shawn Foreman
that gave the Mountaineers a 20-14
halftime lead. It all fell apart from
there for Tulsa, which allowed WVU
to score on its first five possessions

 of the second half. Amos Zereoue ran
for 192 yards, and Bulger threw for
7253 yards to lead theteam. Bulger

now has 546 yards and five touch-

Hoffman, who has been almost per-

Then there are the New York
Yankees, the team everybody loves to
hate. The Yankees have been over-
shadowed by the home-run chase this
season, and there’s poetic justice in a
team from New York City (especially
the Yankees) getting less attention
than it deserves. It’s going to be hard-
er to ignore them in the playoffs.

The Yankees set an American

mom PAGE 8

League record for most wins in a sea-

son. They did it in a longer season
than most of the-other teams at the top
of that list played, but the fact remains
that there aren’t many Americans who
have been around long enough to see
a team better (according to the num-
bers) than the 1998 Yankees.

The beauty of this situation is that
if the Yankees are really as good as
their record suggests (and I suspect
they’re not), then they should breeze
through the playoffs and into the
World Series. There, they will surely
get all their due recognition, without
the shadow of McGwire, whose team
is not in the playoffs, and Sosa, whose
team is forbidden by the laws of
nature to reach the World Series.

The best part of all is that it’s not
over yet. Bring on the postseason!

SEAN PATRICK BRAD / SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Fifth-year senior Matt Lytle could not escape the wrath of the swarming
Virginia Tech defense, which sacked the Panthers eight times.

SACKS

passing. Inexperience on the offensive
line has been a major factor in the last
two losses. This week, Lytle did the
“Hokie Pokie” out of the pocket before
either getting sacked or throwing the
ball to the Tech defense. O’Connor
tried to stay in the pocket and make
something happen. As a result, he was
crushed.

_The offense needs the line to give
it three or four seconds to allow the
play to develop. Lytle and O’Connor
got about half that time on average.
Pitt does not have the advantage of a
bye week to get ready for Akron.

While it is true that Akron’s
defense will not be as strong as
Virginia Tech’s or Penn State’s, it can
easily see what Pitt’s weakness is.

After all, this is the second week in
a row the Panthers’ offensive line was
their major problem and the second
week in a row they were on national
television. If Pitt wants to keep from
getting “Zipped” by Akron next week,
the line must allow plays to develop.

FROM PAGE 8

ATICK B OR FF PHOR
Seth Hornack, a senior leader on '

this year's football team, picked off
a pass in Saturday's game.

 
  

There were other factors in the
loss, but the line sticks out like a sore
quarterback. The offense will settle in
as time goes on, but the line needs the
most work. Pitt hasonly three quarter-
backs, and if the line keeps letting
O’Connor and Lytle get sacked, we
will see John Turman soon.

Quarterback is the most dangerous
position on the ﬁeld as it is. The line
does not need to make the quarterback
the equivalent of a Hollywood stunt
man. Virginia Tech defensive end
Corey Moore alone had four sacks

Lytle and O’Connor had to be tired
of looking at him from a worm’s-eye
view. Pitt does not need to lose any
quarterbacks to injury. After the game,
it was apparent that Lytle could not be
a part of the problem. O’Connor was
given the same punishment as the
ﬁfth-year senior. With the rest of the
team coming together, it is alarming to
see the the offensive line left in the
dust.

O’Connor had his ﬁrst taste of
being a quarterback in the Big East. He
can now quote Bill Clinton and tell
Lytle, “I feel your pain.”

inexperienced, even though he’s a ﬁfth-
year senior,” said Harris.

Lytle and the entire offense played
like an inexperienced team, which helped
the ﬁokies, who needed to travel only
shoi*t:dista‘nces3’for.tl1eir scores.

After a Panther punt_jon= the team’s
ﬁrst possession, the Tech (‘offense attacked
via the ground game, particularly through
Lamont Pegues. Pegues-ran’ for '35 yards
on the drive that started at the Hokies’ 48-
yard line, includinga 20-yard burst off left
tackle for the ﬁrst touchdown of the game
to make it 7-0 Virginia Tech. Pegues ﬁn-
ished with 64 yards rushing for the game,
and the_team would have 146 collective
yards on the ground.

The Panther defense didn’t have long
to regroup, thanks to an interception by

Keion Carpenter off Lyﬂe on the second

play of the next possession. Carpenter
would add two more thefts, including one
that turned into a touchdown, to his
resume to steal the most valuable player
award away from Moore. ,

Six plays later, the Hokies built [on
their lead when Shyrone Stith, their other
tail back, ran oﬁ’ right tackle for a 16-yard
touchdown to give them a 14-0 lead early
in the ﬁrst quarter.

After a Tech ﬁeld goal made the score
17-0, the Panthers eventually got a break
when Seth Homack intercepted a Meyer
pass at the Hokie 35-yard line. After con-
secutive I'l1I1S by Kevan Barlow and an
incomplete pass to Juan Williams, Lytle
was able to connect with Grim in the back
of the end zone for a touchdown. Lytle
found himself scrambling for his life when
Grim broke away to an empty spot and

made himself target. That cut the lead to _
17-7, but it was as close as Pitt would get.

Poor pass-blocking and poor deci-
sion—rnala'ng led to more troubles in the
second half, as the Tech defense continued
its relentless attack. _'

“There’s no question you’ll' be in trou-
ble when you play two junior-college ath-
letes on the line,” said Harris;' “You’re
admitting that you havean area of need.
There’s no competition for these players.
Their only motivation otherthan their own
is through the coaches. I hope this game
motivates them to listen better and work
harder.”

“With the game still undecided, Lytle
made a crucial error when he threw his
third interception to Carpenter, who
returned it 16 yards to give Virginia Tech
a 24-7 lead and destroy any hope of a

Panther comeback.
