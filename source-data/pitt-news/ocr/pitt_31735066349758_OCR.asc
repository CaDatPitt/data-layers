I_n efforts to- reduce Student
Government ﬁnancial aid to the Pitt
Hockey Club, the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) voted lastlnight
to return to the Allocations
Committee a recommendation
which suggested SGB funding of
half the ‘club’s total operating
budget.

Allocations rationale explained
the club should raise the other
funds necessary for the club’s
operating expenses.

In voting to return the
Alloca_tions recomendation, the
Board hoped to cut the club’s
funding through the student
activities fee to 25%, according to

, SGB President Barry Weisband.

Campus Police Election

Hockey Club ' President Bob
Arturo said cutting the club’s funds
would “set back our goal to be
totally funded by the athletic
department.”

“I know you’re trying to force
the athletic department to fund us.
But do you seriously think we can
force the athletic department to
fund us in the next three months?”
Arturo asked. '

A club spokesman told the Board
the hockey club had been told not
to expect to be made a varsity sport
before the construction of a new
sports arena,_sometime within the
next ﬁve years. '

Arturo claimed the club could niyt
raise the additional funds—approx-
imately $12,000

Awaits PLRBpRuIing  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The date for a campus police
union election remains in limbo
pending a ruling from the
Pennslyvania Labor Relations
Board (PRLB) on whether the
Teamsters, the union currently
representing campus police, will be
allowed on the ballot.

The original June 3 election date
was buried by PLRB questions
concerning the legality of the
Teamsters acting as a bargaining
agent for campus police.

State law prohibits the inclusion
of security guards in a unit with
other state employes. The

Teamsters represent other em-
ployes in addition to the compus
police. '

slated to appear on the ballot June
3 were the Teamsters, the
International Brotherhood "of P0-
licemen and the United Plant
Guard Workers of America.

The PLRB is also considering a
challenge to the International
Brotherhood’s appearance on the
ballot because of its afﬁliation with
the National Association of Govern-
ment‘al Employes.

The afﬁliation with another
government employe union could
bar the International Brotherhood
on the same grounds facing the
Teamsters, depending on the ﬁnal
PLRB ruling.

The ﬁnal ruling on either case
will be precedent-setting, and as of

amount requested. According to
Arturo, members earned approxi-
mately-$5,000 from fundraisers last
year, and received $1,000 from the
athletic department.

Weisband supported the Board’s
motion to reduce funding. “With
the help of the board I think we can
get more funds from other sources
like alumni and the athletic
department.

“I disagree with cutting the
funds completely, but I can’t justify
to myself an expenditure of
approximately $166.25 per person
for an organization with limited

members,”'Weisband said, disag- I
-reeing with the Allocations recom-

mendation for 50% funding.
According to Arturo, the club’s
membership should be about 50 in
the fall, including non-playing
members.

The establishment of a comput-
erized information center for
graduate students was proposed at
a meeting of the Graduate and
Professional Student Association
(GPSA) yesterday‘.

There is a need for a centralized
information center for graduate

students planning to attend Pitt so ,

they know where to go to obtain
information on foundation funding,
work study programs and course
planning, according to GPSA
chairperson Sandra DeBourelando.

A committee was formed to
present the need for a graduate
information center to Chancellor
Posvar.

“Hopefully, the University will
pay for full-time personnel, not just
work-study students to staff the
information center,” DeBoure-
lando said. “I see this as being our
main project this summer,”

The new $16-per-term manda-
tory student health fee was also
discussed at yesterday's meeting.

All full-time members of GPSA

- will have to pay the mandatory fee.

Part-time students still will have

access to the Student Health‘

Center, but strictly on a fee basis,
Senate Council Member Mark
Hiller said.

Part-time students also will have
the option of enlisting in a
voluntary insurance program for
the Student Health Center. That

" plan is now in the process of being

set up by GPSA, Hiller said.

“lt’s probably advantageous for
a student to enlist in the service,”
DeBourelando said.

In the past, a large number of
students didn’t know about the
availability of the. Health Center,

' according to Hiller.

“The insurance program was

handledgby Blue Cross last year. _p _

 

If this window washer were brave, he could turn around and have a if

great view of the campus.

This year it’s in-house, so it will be

clearly the responsibility of the
University to make the availability
known to students,” Hiller said.

The GPSA must decrease the -‘

volume of use. Extended hours of» 1
usage and more advertising would
achieve an increase in volume, '

according to_ DeBourelando.

ODI Gripes About Liquor

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Members of Oakland Develop-
ment, Inc. (ODI) aired their
grievences about teenage drinking
in Oakland to Louis A. Donati,
assistant superintendent of the
Pittsburgh Law Enforcement Ofﬁce
of the Liquor Control Board (LCB)
at an ODI meeting Monday. ’

“I believe everyone knows The
Original (Hot Dog Shop) is the
worst offender for selling to minors
and attracting disruptive patrons,”
ODI President Lois Devereaux
said.

Earlier this month the LCB found
The Original guilty of selling to
minors and suspended their license
for seven days. A suspension only
prohibits the sale of alcohol by the
licensee and does not require the
licensee to forego other business.

Because The Original appealed
the decision, the establishment
can ignore the suspension until a
decision on the appeal is handed
down by Allegheny County Court.

The Commonwealth Court is the

ultimate appellate body.
“Hampered by bureaucratic

procedures, the appeal process

could take a year,” Donati said.

The ,members agreed The
Original is one of several Forbes
Avenue licensees violating LCB
rulings.

Donati encouraged Oakland citi-
zens to report their suspicions of
licensee violations to the LCB.
Anonymous complaints are ac-
cepted.

After a complaint is ﬁled, an
undercover LCB ofﬁcial visits the
licensee in question to investigate
the complaint.

If the LCB ofﬁcial also suspects
the licensee of selling to minors,
permitting minors to frequent the
establishment, or any other LCB
violation a task force of LCB
ofﬁcials and city police raids the
licensee’s establishment and au-
thorizes questionnaires to suspect-
ed underage patrons.

- An administrative hearing is
held if the patrons indicate on the
questionaires they have been
illegally served alcohol. The
minors are not arrested. -

“The LCB is mostly concerned
with the licensee’s violation of LCB
regulations,” Donati said. “We
used to arrest all minors, but we
couldn't continue doing that.”

If the licensee is found guilty, the
hearingexaminer recommends

  

LOIS DEVEREAUX

either a revocation or suspension of
his license or a ﬁne. Sometimes
both a ﬁne and suspension are
issued.

“Presently_there is no uniform
set of , guidelines for issuing
penalties,” Donati said. “Some-
times rulings are inconsistent,
because they are subject to the
examiner’ s discretion.’ ’

Donati said he believes “legisla-
tive pull helps to lower some ﬁnes
and suspensions.”

Devereaux also expressed dis-
content with the ‘fbrawling,

spilling over and disorder on.

Forbes Avenue.”

A few licensees near campus
have hire policeman to maintain
order on their premises.

Donati mentioned an LCB ofﬁcial
can police only licensed premises
and cannot tackle disorderly
conduct outside.

Before a licensee can be arrested
for disorderly operation, i.e. noise,
ﬁghting, or swearing on the
premises, it must be determined
whether the licensee was negligent
or tried to stop the disruption.

Not Enough Tillie

BY MATT KAMBIC

There was a time when there was _.
enough time, Lately, however, it
has become clear the average
human being cannot effectively
schedule all his desired activities
into the standard twenty-four hour
day.

Some enterprising souls have
begun stretching their days into 30
hours, so that by the time the
weekend arrives, it’s Monday
already. These same people
disrupt their own yearly time
schedules so drastically they can
often be seen swimming outdoors
in December, watching the leaves
change color in early spring and
going to the Super Bowl in
.nid-June. One fellow tragically
passed away four years’ before his
death, due to his unfortunate
purchasing of an out-of-date

calendar at a rummage sale.

For college students, the short-
age of time presents a peculiar

Several years
ago at Bristol, a drunken fan in the
stands threw a bottle at a moving
stock car, and all the spectators
around him immediately stood up
and pointed at the man so security
guards could apprehend him. Why
didn't the fans just sit there and
enjoy the accident the object might
have caused? There is a small
percentage of people who do go to
see wrecks, but the overwhelming
majority of fans are not ghouls of
the type Sybert describes himself
as being.

Secondly, one must remember
that the ﬁgures Sybert gives about
deaths caused by the Indy 500 are
taken ‘out of context, since they
include every race since 1911.

The war with time has only
begun as you make your way out
the door in the morning. Man and
nature’s time-traps must by dealt
with» throughout the day. For
commuters, the limbo of waiting
for the bus is often enough to kill a
potentially productive day. And

How often does a student look at

one hell of a lot of fun. To take a
high-powered machine to the limit
is an experience unequalled any-

where. You get a feeling of power
as you drive the car at the very
edge of control, drifting it through

the corners and keeping it going
where you wantit to by sheer skill.

It is something which must be
experienced to be truly understood.

I experience it every weekend while
racing go-carts, and I would give it
up for nothing in the world.

So, Sybert, come May 30 I hope
you enjoy your beer and when you

hope you are severely disappointed
by the lack of accidents. As for me,

Oscar Peterson in Russia, Pablo,
2625-711

Jazz techniques and melodies
throughout this century can be
found in pianist Oscar Peterson’s
concert performance recorded in
Russia. The music is melodic,
presenting anunlimited variety of
moods. It is energizing and fresh;

From Russiawith Jazz LP

On the second disc, Jake Hanna
joins in on drums. The classic tunes
they play are even recognized by
the foreign audience. Peterson
makes the old brand new in “Take
The ‘A’ Train.” Gersh:win’s “Sum-
mertime” is executed with such

excitement that the listener doesn't
have to approach it.with half-closed
eyes and a daydream. Eyes are
wide and ears are open to catch the
complex beauty—and the new
rendition. '

On the last side the trio swings
with style on Hefti’s “Li’l Darlin’,”
making it new again with Lgrand’s
“Watch What Happens,” and
working the crowd to a spiritualis-

tic, hand-clapping frenzy with
Peterson’s “Hallelujah Trail.” The
last tune, “Someone To’ Watch
Over lvle,” featuring Peterson on
solo piano, doesn’t cheat the
audience (or the listener), but
quiets down and brings it back to

earth with the same expertise .

Concert recordings contain some
of the worst and best music

available. The best captures a spirit _

along with a technical skill, like

Snake-Charming Faith Cult

BY CONNIE GIEL

The Persecuted Prophets,
Carden and Pelton, $9.95, 188 pps.

The men drape a hissing
rattlesnake around the neck of
another man. The man screams
and jumps frantically.

After several minutes they
disentangle the snake and hand the
gibbering man a mug of strych-
nine.

He looks around him, and drains
it slowly. His eyes bulge and his
throat pulses rapidly.

He holds oiit his. hands, palm up.

The other men ignite small

torches, and lay the ﬂaming sticks .

in the man's open hands.
hands blacken immediately.
Sound like something out of a
psychotic fraternity hazing?
It's not. These men belong to

The,

' the Holiness Church of _God in

Jesus’ Name, a snake-handling,
poison-drinking, ﬂame-holding cult
of religious zealots..

The ‘small _,cult congregates in
backwoods churches in West
Virginia, Tennessee and other
Appalachian states. They encou-
rage mass revivals, in which men
and women work themselves into
trance-like frenzies of devotion.

The man described earlier
screamed and jumped in ecstasy.
not fear, according to other
believers.

“Praise the Lord,” they shout.
Only a few are among the
chosen—the ones who claim God
wants them to fondle and kiss

coiling cobras, and eat handfuls of
Drano.

Many dismiss the group, saying
the cult is reading the Bible out of
context when snake handlers cite
Ch. 16, Verse 1§ of the Gospel
according to St. Mark. The

passage promises believers will be
able to safely handle snakes and
drink poison, provided their faith is
great enough.

The church has made headlines
in the last few years whenever one
of the snake handlers is bitten. The

national spotlight focuses on the
tiny cult as the bitten one refuses
treatment. The cultists beseech

God to release the poisoned one. If
he does not, and the person dies,
they philosophically shrug it off as
God's will. . '

The believers are simple people,
who steadfastly talk of Jesus and
his goodness. Nothing shakes their
faith.

The serpent handlers have been
rigorously subjected to scrutiny.
Through it all they have emerged
unmoved, though they have been
dismissed as fakes and spooks by
bewildered scientists. »

The Persecuted Prophets by
Karen Carden and Robert Pelton,
is an eyewitness, fact-ﬁlled account
of the snake handlers. The authors
entered the region and immersed
themselves in the cult’s beliefs and
practices.

, The book is ﬁlled with half- and‘
full-page-photos of men wrapping
snakes ‘around themselves and
smiling in religious delight.

-The Persecuted Prophets never
gets bogged down in rebuttals and
counterclaims. It simply tells the
story of people who are indeed
persecuted. *

The courts have not _yet found a
way to deal with the serpent
handlers.
have banned the church’s prac-
tices, but enforcement is lax.

Perhaps this book’s version of
their story will clarify the snake
handlers’ guarantee of freedom to
worship in our society.

“It is more ridiculous to ridicule
than to accept,” as the authors say
in their preface.

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

It’s really strange how fast the
.bad news has spread. But in case
you haven’t heard, The Rolling
Stones will not be appearing in
Pittsburgh this summer.

The Stones have deleted several
dates from their upcoming Ameri-
can stadium tour, and, unfortu-
nately, Pittsburgh is one of the
cities being dropped. _

Over the years, Pittsburgh has
not been one of the Stones" favorite
or most-frequented American tour
stops. Back in 1964 on their first
visit to the ‘States, the band played
before a small and hostile crowd at

Westview Park. During their _ﬁrst ~

visit to the Civic Arena in ’66,
Jagger was nearly killed by a shock
from his ungrounded microphone.
Back again in ’72, Jagger was
nearly done in again. This time by
a whiskey bottle thrown from the
hand of an overzealous Arena
burnout. And in ’69 and ’75 the
Stones bypassed Pittsburgh com-
pletely.

But 1976 was going to be
different. The exciting news was
broadcast repeatedly by radio
stations all over town for the last
two months. July 10 was (not going
to be just another hot summer
afternoon. The Stones were going
to be in town. The “Greatest Rock
n’ Roll band in the World” in our
humble midst! A .

Phooey! The cancellation hit me
like a ton of bricks. I was getting
up for the Stones. I think a lot of
people were. High schools
throughout the area were already
buzzing with the news. People
drinking‘ and talking in Oakland
and Shadyside bars were already
worrying about getting.tickets.

dents tingled in anticipation of the

A400 Blows: Truffaut's “New Wave"

Excitement flooded the cinema-
tic ﬁeld in 1959. In that year and
the succeeding four more than 170
young directors in France were
able to make their ﬁrst feature
film. Until then the studio
establishment had solidiﬁed e-
nough to keep fresh talent out. But,
thanks to the success of the

then-unknown Rodger Vadim mo- '

vie “And God Created Woman”
(1956), producers were eager to
repeat their winning formula of a
low‘ budget ﬁlm with a young
director. A

Thus the French New Wave

ment, nor did it carry a particular
style (such as Italian Neo-Realism
did). Rather, the young French
directors postulated their belief the
camera was the ﬁlmmaker’s pen,
and saw the ﬁlmmaker as author;
hence the ﬁlm that is a personal
statement. -

1959 was also the year of
Truffaut's Les Quatre Cents Coups
(The 400 Blows), whose very title is
an echo of the early science
ﬁlmmaker Georges Melies’ 400
Blows of the Devil. A partially
autobiographical ﬁlm, it examines
the situation of a "sensitive,
vulnerable 13-year old-boy/ adult in
an unstable family and an
authoritarian school system, as
well as the effect of the
interrelationship between them.
Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud), an
unwanted child, is obviously an
intruder in the lives of his parents.
The boy becomes an instrument
through which the mother and
father attack and placate each
other, in attempts to reinforce their

egos. Although mischievious, An-
toine derives moral strength from
his rebelliousness- Still, it leaves
him lonely and dissatisﬁed because
of his need for support and
sensitivity in the adult world.

_ Truffaut effectively investigates
this conﬂict between the spontane-
ous individual and a restraining
society by the structural alteration
between motion and status.
Through continual motion, we see
the streets of Paris enhanced by a
ﬂow of life—boys run, cars are
driven, cameras pan and track. As
Antoine and his friend are playing
hookey from school the camera
rapidly pans after them and races-
ahead, of them, moving faster than
they could possibly walk, but we
ﬁnd they are already on the other
side of the street ahead of the
camera. This continual merging of.
one event into another stresses the
enjoyment in spontaneity, being
antithetical to the institutionalized
time. Later in the ﬁlms, as Antoine
is carried off to jail in a van, he
stares out of the barred window as
the Paris night whizzes by. We see

a close-up of his tear-stained face, I

with the adult prisoners out of
focus behind him. As we look out at

- Paris over Antoine's shoulder, his

solitary confinement is made
poignant by "his contemplative
stillness'in the lively motion of the
city streets, a visual reminder of
the freedom he must forego.

I. Periodically, these Vfreeflowing
images face and are interrupted by

ltd-gap-ou_:,-:,o.«....

places as the school, reform school
and prison. -

Throughout the ﬁlm we ﬁnd
Truffaut interplaying these strate-
gies, succinctly summarizing An-
toine’s feeling of constantly. run-
ning toward some freedom and
always being caught. Whether it
comes in the form of a prison-like
school or a school-like prison, his
rejection is a desireto be accepted
by the very world he rejects. This
paradox makes him vulnerable; he
runs in circles, he is trapped. '

In the ﬁnal sequence Antoine
escapes from the reform school
during a soccer game. We follow
Antoine running on a hill and down
a slope. Seeing him make
footprints in the sand, we
understand his momentary free-
dom" and exhilaration. As he runs
into the water and then turns back
to the shore toward us, his face
approaches with the quizzical
expression, “Where do I go from
here?”.-The ﬁlm leaves us with
Leaud caught in a suspended,
unanimated gaze into the camera.
As he stares at the audience we are
now forced to comtemplate the

economic and social conditions and .

the personal inadequacies that
have placed him here. Alone,
unloved, rejected, he stands
outcast on this piece of sand with
the solitude of the empty sky and
the vast ocean behind him.

Rivers Stadium are just like any’
other steel and concrete bowls
across the country. Designed for
hockey, basketball and football,
they are quickly converted into
gloriﬁed rock palaces. Complete
with lousy acoustics and plenty of
seats.

Pittsburgh audiences can be
crude, but go to a concert in Detroit
if you want to get a real glimpse of
concert rowdiness. Except for
Dicesare-Engler, the promoters are
all national outﬁts who deal with
groups at all stops throughout the,
country.

That leaves us with the groups
themselves. Granted, Pittsburgh
is not tinseltown U.S.A., but is
Cleveland? ‘Philadelphia? How
about Houston?

We may think this town is

, someplace special, but to world-~

traveled superstars Pittsburgh is
an old smelly sneaker.

Something they occasionally use,
but more often totally disregard".

Highsports Prices

 Hitting Average Fan

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

David Fink of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is writing a series of
columns this week dealing with the high cost of attending a sporting
event. Take my advice and read it—before you go broke.

The exorbitant prices can be traced back to a number of starting

‘ points. First, you have the arenaor stadium construction itself. Let’s

look at the Civic Arena ﬁrst.
The Arena is a dump as professional sports buildings go. So the fans
who built it with their taxe§ are now forced to dig a little deeper to pay

,,/".:r—_improvements, many of which are unnecessary.
‘xi

Like the new balcony seats. There’s no reason for them. Whenever
the Penguins start reaching the Stanley Cup ﬁnals and can pack the
building with 18,000 people or so the additional seats will pay off.

But the Penguins, though headed in theright direction, are a long,
long way from reaching the prowess of the Montreal Canadiens or the
Philadelphia Flyers. For a team that can’t even upend the Toronto
Maple Leafs in a preliminary round, the Penguins are going a little too
far. '

And surely, unless Tony Orlando returns or the Beatles regroup or
Jehovah appears in person at one of his conventions, there are not a
great deal of events that will require all that extra seating. But, we the
fans will pay for it nonetheless. ‘ '

Three Rivers Stadium is not without its ﬂaws. The biggest gripe
from the steelworker or the middle-income person. is that the immense

Stadium Club takes up seating the biggest supporters of the Pirates .

and the Steelers, the average fans, ought to rightly have. Sure, the big
corporation and foundation heads have pumped money ‘into the
,:’“‘§',lding of the ballpark, but they aren’t the ones who will go to the
‘ballpark day in and day out and live and die with the local teams.
Mr. Ordinary Fan is getting gypped. Of course, the Pirates do have
one of the lowest sets of ticket prices in the majors and the Steelers’
rates are not that bad, but the stadium should belong _to the fans, who
s’ auld be able to pay their dollars for the choicest seats, not just those
in “peanut heaven.” Who knows how many terriﬁc seats could have
been added in the stadium hadthere not been a Stadium Club.
Another portion of the ticket money goes to finance the players’
salaries. Yes, those overpaid, underworked and spoiled-rotten
“superstars” we idolize are taking us for our money. It’s not much
different than falling prey to a pickpocket. ,
When the Penguins got Vic Hadﬁeld from the New York Rangers
several years ago, they also got his sky-high salary and, since the
franchise nearly went bankrupt last summer, somebody, and it wasn’t

__,t_he Penguins, was going to have to sacriﬁce to pay Hadfield’s salary.
4... - Still another increase in ticket prices was passed for hockey matches

at the Big Igloo and Hadﬁeld, Apps, Pronovost and all the high-priced
skaters are once again living in luxury. x ’

The Pirates, Steelers, Triangles and even Bruno Sammartino double

the contents of their wallets everytime you, the fan, go to see them.
******

The recent signing of Penguin defenseman Ron Stackhouse to anew
“long-term" contract leaves me with mixed feelings.

Sure, Stackhouse was the highest-scoring backliner the Penguins
ever had and one of the best scoring defensemen in the National,
Hockey League, but is he ready now to settle down and play the kind of
hockey he is capable of playing?

Or is he going to continue to leave his position, get caught up the ice
after scoring attempts and stage more pointing-at-the roof incidents as
he has been known to do in the past. .-

/,_.,The 26-year-old burly defenseman, known to fans as “Lurch,”
'-’-....-filed speculation that, as a free agent, he would jump to another

team. Hekhad been disgruntled with area fans, who were on his back
when he made a mistake and apparently he also disliked Pittsburgh's
potholes.

Stackhouse led the Penguins in the plus-minus category’ while
posting '11 goals and 60 assists and was also named recipient of the
team's “Unsung Hero” award.

Following the signing, Stackhouse’ said, “Management made it very
obvious to me that they wanted me here. We have always had a good
relationship and as far as I’m concerned, they made me a good offer.”

Let’s hope.'Stackhouse fulﬁlls his end of the bargain.

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Dave Parker,
returning to action after a 13-game
absence due to a knee injury, drove
in two runs with a pinch-hit single

_in a ﬁve-run sixth inning that

carried the Pittsburgh Pirates to a
6-3 victory over the Montreal Expos
last night. .

Montreal starting pitcher Dan I

Warthen held a 3-0 lead going into
the‘ sixth, when the Pirates rallied
with two out and nobody on base.

Dolores Stargell, wife of Pirate

The Chicago Bears of the

,National Football League an-

nounces Wednesday they have
obtained rookie offensive tackle
Wayne Mattingly in a trade with
the Pittsburgh Steelers.

A spokesman for the Bears said

‘ the Steelers received a future

Bears’ draft choice for Mattingly,
but declined to disclose how high a
choice the team gave up.

Mattingly, from the University of
Colorado, was picked by the
Steelers in the seventh round of the
1975 draft. He injured a leg in
training camp last season and was
placed on ,-the team’s injured
reserve list. .

Mattingly, 24, is 6-4 and weighs
255_pounds.

Tom Liebenguth, the’ highly-
recruited scholastic tennis star
recently signed by Pitt, gave
Panther Coach George Dieffenbach
a pleasant surprise this past

weekend by capturing the Pennsyl- .

Shippensburg State College.

The North Allegheny standout,
seeded number two in the tourney,
upended top seed Pete Tschernoff
of Bjshop McDevitt High School,
6-1, 6-7. 6-3. Liebenguth is
expected to be a great‘ asset to the
Panther tennis program next
season.

RAY BROOK, N.Y. (AP)--
Michael Ford, the President’s

26-year-old son, was in a hiking .

party that was lost last week in the

rugged Adirondack Mountains:
during an unusual spring sno;{\\'-~

storm.

A state environmental conserva-
tion ofﬁcer conﬁrmed reports that
young Ford was in the part of 13
hikers stranded in the high peaks of
Mt. Nye near Lake Placid.

The group set out Sunday, May
16, and intended to remain in the
mountains through May 22, he
said. But a storm hit the region
May 19 and left as much as 14
inches of snow in some moun-
tainous regions.

The Ford party radioed to two

Secret Service agents in

JUDGE PAID T O DO NOTHING

ADEL, Iowa (AP)--A federal
administrative law judge is being
paid $37,760 annually to stay at
home and do nothing because, he
says, the government doesn’t
agree with his rulings. He hasn’t
heard a case in 14 months.

“I want to go back to work,”
John Kinggan administrative law
judge for the Social Secuyéif-
Administration’s Bureau of Hear-A
ings and Appeals, told the Des
Moines Register. - “Sitting around
the house all day is driving me out
of my mind and ruining my
marriage.’_’

King, 65, told the newspaper in a
copyrighted interview he is not
working because “the bureaucracy
simply didn’t like the way I was
handling cases.

“I have been at this job for along
time and my competency was never
questioned,” he said. He said he
doesn’t quit because “I’m used to»,

living on this kind of salary andwx-‘-‘

need the money.”

BOOT CAMP HAZING

WASHINGTON
ine Commandant Louis H. Wilson
testified Wednesday he is “taking
all possible action—rapidly” to
minimize boot camp abuses such as
the alleged beating death of one
recruit and shooting and wounding
of another. .

“I am determined that 
recruits will be treated ﬁrmly,
fairly and with dignity—and still be
transformed into the world’s best
fighting men," Gen. Wilson told
the House "military personnel
subcommittee. A

The commandant told the con-
gressmen he wished he could say
the incidents were “aberrations in
an otherwise perfect system.

“Unfortunately, I cannot,” he
said.

Wilson was referring to the
alleged beating death of Pvt. Lynn
E. McClure in San Diego and the
accidental shooting of Pvt. Harry"
W. Hiscock in the hand during
hazing at Parris Island, S.C., last
January.
