WPIC Workers Stage Protest Gov. Shapp Okays Funds’

For State-related Schools

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Some 25 non-professional
workers from Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC),
yesterday walked into the office of
William Hannon, labor attorney for
the University to protest the
University's refusal to recognize
their union.

The group was comprised of
off-duty members from the dietary,
housekeeping, maintainence, and
psychiatric aide staffs. The
workers met in the CL Commons
Room prior to the walk-in.

The action is one in a series of
demonstrations by the non-profes-
sional workers involved in the labor
dispute between Union 1199 and
the University.

The door to Hannon’s office was
locked, but he came out into the
hall to talk to the workers, and
arranged for the use of a
conference hall on the Cathedral’s
first floor.

The walk-in was motivated by
what one worker described as the
“delaying” of the University in
recognizing 1199 as the bargaining
agent of the non-professionals at
WPIC.

According to Sam McGill, a
psychiatric aide at WPIC and a
spokesman for the workers, Han-
non had promised to sit down and
negotiate after a ruling by the State
Labor Relations Board (LRB).

The ruling came on the Univer-
sity’s second appeal November 7,
and the case was moved on a third
appeal to the Court of Common
Pleas. This third appeal is viewed
by the workers as a delaying tactic.

At the conference, Hannon
denied having made a promise to
negotiate. He insisted his
statement was, “that this will go
through a final judicial determina-
tion.” Hannon pointed out that the
LRB is only an agency of the
government, not a judicial body.

Members of the non-profes-
sionals present were concerned
that continued litigation would
leave them -open to harassment,

which they feel has already been
leveled at pro-union elements in
the hospital.

McGill, directing his words to
Hannon, noted the action was
designed to break the union.
“...While the union is in court
you’re using harassment,” he said.

“You're stalling, you're trying to
cut up the bargaining unit and
we’re not going to stand still for
it.”

In reply, Hannon maintained
that accusations of harassment
should be handed to the LRB. He
claimed the University had given
its lawyers instructions to proceed
quickly with the court action.

“We're going to try and get this
thing expedited,” he said.

The history of the dispute
between labor and the administra-
tion of WPIC involves two
unsuccessful appeals by the Uni-
versity. The grounds for the appeal
against the election of Union 1199
are, according to Hannon, irregular
election procedure and the ques-
tion of the appropriateness of the
bargaining unit.

Earlier actions by the union

included a sit-down demonstration '

and meetings with Hannon.
According to McGill; attempts by
concerned community to mediate
the dispute have, been ignored by
the University.

Accusations of harassment
centered around the institution of
tests by Dr. Thomas Detre, director
of medicine at WPIC, and the use
of raises to allegedly divide the
bargaining unit.

According to members of the
worker-committee -which visited

. Hannon, the tests were used to try

to separate college graduates from
the union. McGill maintains that
unjustified raises given to some 21
five-year workers were also used as
a similar tool. '

Detre was unavailable for reply
but Hannon later mentioned that
Detre had usecf similar in-service
programs at other hospitals.
According to Hannon the tests
were designed to upgrade the
services of the hospital, not as an
anti-labor weapon.

legislation giving 187.6 million in
state aid to Penn State University,
Temple and the University of

New Department Heads

Dr. Charles L. Ralph, professor of
biology at Pitt, has been named
chairman of the department of
biology, replacing Dr. Richard T.
Hartman, who has been named
director of Pitt’s Pymatuning
Laboratory of Ecology. The
appointments were announced by
Dr. Jerome L. Rosenberg, dean of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Ralph, who joined Pitt’s biology
faculty in 1959, served as assistant
professor until 1962. He was
appointed -associate professor in
1962 and a professor in 1967.

Hartman served as chairman of‘

the biology department from 1970
to 1973, before being appointed
head of the Pymatuning Labora-
tory, a teaching and research
facility for the study of basic and
applied ecology, located in Lines-
ville, PA.

An affiliate of the University since
1947, Hartman was appointed an
assistant professor in 1952. an
associate professor in 1960, and a

full professor in 1966.

Rosenberg also announced three
other department heads. Named
chairman of the department of
Germanic languages and litera-
-tures was Dr. John Neubauer; of
the department of English, Dr.
Robert Hinman; and of the
department of history, Dr. David
Montgomery. __

Neubauer, associate professor of
German, held a similar position at
Case-Western Reserve University
from 1,969 to 1973. From 1964 to
1969, he was on the German faculty
at Princeton University, serving as
an instructor and as an assistant
professor. .

Prior to coming here Hinman was
professor and chairman of the
English Department at Emory
University from 1969 to 1973;
Montgomery, a member of Pitt’s :
history department since 1963,
served as assistant professor until
1968, was named associate profes-
sor in 1968, and professor in 1973.

BY DEBBIE POPP
Academic standards. are the
—main concern of Dr. Herbert Rubin,
new assistant dean for graduate
programs of the Faculty of Arts and

Sciences. -

Rubin, a professor in the speech
and theatre arts department since
1959, regards his new role as that
of a “benevolent cop” helping
direct admissions, registration,
degree requirements, grading, and
teaching assistantships.

Concerning graduate admissions
Rubin said, “the University is
tightening up and can afford to be
more selective now. '

“Raising and maintaining high
standards,” he said, “is better for
the institution, better.for the other
students, and better for , the
individual in the long run.”

Asked abouta mediocre student's
chances, Rubin replied, “Initial
consideration should be why. the
student was advised to apply to a
graduate program. Second consid-
eration should be what advantage
to the profession, to society, and to
the individual would be gained by
admitting the student."

As assistant dean, Rubin may also
function as mediator in grievance
procedures for cases of plagarism,
cheating, or unfair treatment.
“We have the advantage of a third
party to intervene on behalf of a
student or department who lodges
a complaint,” he said.

In line with his main interest in
supervising academic standards,
Rubin wants to revise the graduate
bulletin. He quoted Dean of
graduate programs Elizabeth Bar-
anger. “We want to know if the
rules we supervise are good or bad
ones so we can change them.”

Rubin also wants to examine
teaching assistants who he feels
are often exploited because they
teach at a lower cost.

Rubin expects to continue as
assistant dean for a year.

McGill mentioned the new
policy of shift rotation at WPIC as
another case of harassment by the
University. “When you make us
rotate shifts,” he said to Hannon,
“you disrupt the continuity of
patient care. We’re passing the
guilt on to you. When you string us
up, the patients suffer.”

The reason for unionization,
McGill said, was to secure for the
non-professional workers a status
equitable with their importance to
the institution.

“We’re the backbone of the
operation,” he said in a later
interview. “You can’t run a

hospital without the dieticians, the
housekeepers, the maintenance
men and the psychiatric aides.”

“We’re the prime therapists,”
said Pete Reinhart, a psychiatric
aide. “We do the intensive work.”
McGill said the next step for the
union would be an informational
picket line at the hospital, staffed
by off-duty workers.

‘University resistance to the
union, according to Hannon, is
strictly legal within the bounds of
Pennsylvania labor laws. “We
want to set a precedent for future
labor cases,” he said in a later
interview. E-“Our argument here is
that we have an inappropriate
bargaining unit.”

for Engineers’ Week requested
$4,900 for the ball, with $2,000 of
that amount to be generated from a
$5 per couple ticket charge.

The Allocations Committee feels
the event will not draw sufficient

‘support from the entire student

body to. warrant the expense. It is
the Committee’s policy not to fund
such functions.

Allocations Committee member,
Ira Dichter stated, “We’re not
saying they can't have it; they just
have to pay for it themselves. No
special interest programming is
funded out of the student activities
fee.”

Susan Lynn Suehr, chairman of
the central planning committee,
disputed the idea that the ball is a
special interest event. “A lot of the
people who attend the ball come
from CAS (College of Arts and
Sciences). Approximately 50 per
cent are non-engineers,” she
stated.

Alluding to the Allocations Com-
mittee’s rationale behind its
decision, SG president Rege
Kaufman noted it was the same
reasoning used in the decision not
to fund the Greek Week Ball.
Kaufmann emphasized the need
for consistency.

Paul Wasilko, vice-president of
the Engineering Student Cabinet,
asked why the Shamrock Ball was
funded last year but not this year.

Dichter replied, ‘‘I can't answer
for last year’s Committee.”

SG board member Sue Ruffner
added, “The feeling this year is
that groups should incur all costs
for personal expenses.”

, organizations and can be done under the rationale of providing what
. _the students want. I
:- Such actions raise the point of who is the Allocations Committee to say
what it is the students want. Brining down to the specific case
concerning us here, what are the qualiﬁcations of this or any other
Allocations Committee to be the publisher of student publications.
What technical knowledge do they have of the preparation of a
"publication for printing, or of the printing process itself? Who is to say
that their impressions of what the student body wants from a
publication are any more valid than the editor's impressions or the
staff’s impressions? It is, of course, possible for the members of the
_Allocations Committee to learn all this, but their jobis already so
massive that to force them to learn it would cause some other area of
their concern to suffer.
— [There is a further-obligation that falls on the Allocations Committee
E through this proposal. In addition to the rights and responsibilities of
‘ being a publisher they will also have to be prepared to assume the
liabilities of a publisher. It must be understood that there is a very
. clear distinction between responsibilities and liabilities.
Another point that must be made, and cannot be stressed too
’ strongly, is the door this proposal leaves open. While we are not going
 _on a witch hunt or trying to impugn the motives of the Allocations
, ‘ Committee, the possibility exists that some future Allocations
3, Committee may interpret this by-law as allowing them to censor the
. opinions and creativity of the student staffs of the publications. In the
last several years there has been a great deal of discussion throughout
V-3 the country about the value of a free press. We feel it has been proven
j; that free press is a necessary part of any society, whether it be one as
-'.'**large as the United States, or one as small as the University of
 _ Pittsburgh.
 restriction of this right should not be allowed to take effect.
The reason this proposal could be open to various interpretations in‘
the future is the total lack of definition of any of the terms in the
 proposal. What, for example, does the Allocations. Committee mean
_ _’when they say “the rights and responsibilities of a publisher,” and
 what do they consider as coming under the general heading of
pi “disbursement of funds?” In the explanatory paragraphs
_ I accompanying the proposal, terms such as “adequate staffs” and
~- “treated accordingly” are used without giving any indication of who
will make those determinations and upon what criteria they will be
made. While we are not saying that the purpose of the proposal is to
censor the free press at Pitt, we are saying that it does not preclude the
,7, possibility of someone using it as a base for censorship in the future.
If we assume the purpose of the Allocations Committee in writing this
proposal was not to censor the publications, then what was the
purpose? Why were the publications picked out for this honor, when as
the proposal itself says, the publications are not separate entities
entitled to special treatment? Certainly publications are not the only
- organizations to have had occassion in the past to challenge actions of
‘the Allocations Committee. *

For all the reasons given above, we urge the Student Government
Board to immediately defeat the proposal.

Once the proposal has been disposed of, we can approach the
mutually recognized problem of the relationship between the
publications and the allocations process, with a clean slate.

We propose that as soon as the Allocations Committee proposal has
been defeated, meetings be started between members of the Student
Government Board and representatives of the publications so that this
issue may be brought to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as

’ possible.

For-d: Inconsistent

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

As the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives swiftly moves to conﬁrm a
new vice-president of the United
States, it is time the people recall
an action Gerald Ford took a few
years ago.

It was April 15, 1970, only one
week after the Senate rejected
President Nixon's nomination of G.
Harrold Carswell for Supreme
Court Justice. when Gerald Ford
announced his drive to impeach
Justice William 0. Douglas.

Douglas is noted for his liberal
votes concerning segregation,
pornography, abortion, etc.

Ford, speaking from the well of
the House. charged Douglas with
l) association with the Albert
Parvin Foundation, which aids
students from underdeveloped
countries, but “has links to Las
Vegas gamblers," 2) Writing
Points of Rebellion. an “inflamma-
tory book which “gives sympathe-
tic encouragement to impression-
able young students and hard-core
fanatics who expouse the militant
method,” 3) writing for porno-
graphic magazines, and 4) marry-
ing extremely young girls.

Concluding his delivery after a
half hour Ford announced, “He is
unfit and should be removed. I
would vote to impeach him right
now.” ‘ '

An angry Andrew Jacobs of
Indiana put Ford’s announcement
in its proper context when he
mockingly marched to the well, and
dropped in the hopper the
resolution calling for Douglas’
impeachment, and challenged Ford
to cast his vote.

Here are the facts about Justice
Douglas, which prove Congress-
man Ford’s grounds for impeach-
ment were completely presumpt-
uous. First, his book, Points of
Rebellion explains the use of
violence as a means to redress
grievence-s when all other means
have failed.

The cover of the 1970 edition
reads,” Justice Douglas argues
that young people are right to rise
up against widespread poverty,
segregation, inequitable laws, and
inadequate education...He points
out that although violence has no
constitutional sanction,‘ it is often
the only effective response when
grievences keep mounting. . . ’ ’

On Ford’s third charge, he
alleges that Douglas was writing
for pornographic magazines.
“When I first encountered facts of
Mr. Justice Douglas’ involvement
with pornographic publications and
expousal of hippie—yippie style

E

 

revolution, I was inclined to
dismiss his fractious behavior as
the first sign of senility.".

The fact is Random House,
publisher of Points of Rebellion,
had complete rights. and they sold
exerpts to Evergreen, a hard-core
pornography magazine. According

to Douglas. he had no prior
knowledge of the incident.

Certainly, he wasn't, as Ford
claims. “writing for hard-core

pornography magazines.”

It is too ridiculous to address
Ford’s last arugment, that Douglas
marries extremely young girls.

Could it be that Ford is angry
with Douglaslbecause the exerpts
that appeared in Evergreen maga-
zine were accompanied by a
full-page caricature of President
Nixon made to look like Great
Britain’s King George III?

Could it be, as Time magazine
reported, “Most observers assume
that Ford wants to impeach
Douglas as a reprisal for Richard
Nixon's two Senate defeats in the

Haynesworth and Carswell cases?"
The interesting point of Ford’s
lengthy address. is that he devotes
a large amount of time explaining
his ‘definition of impeachment.
“What then,” Ford asks. “Is an
impeachable offense?” He ans-
wers,_ “The only honest answer is
that an impeachable offense is
whatever a majority of the House of
Representatives considers it to be
at a given moment in history.”

We can logically draw two
alternatives from Ford’s argu-
ments. The first is that we should
do as Ford suggests, and proceed
to impeach President Nixon on
presumptuous grounds, the same
presumptuous grounds that he was
willing to impeach Justice Douglas
with only three years ago.

The second is that we should
recognize the irrationality of Ford’s
address and think twice, and
probably three times before con-
firming him to be the next
vice-president of the United States.
Or maybe we should do both.

The President:
A Trust Betrayed

BY ROSS HARRISON

It was announced in a recent
statement from the White House
that President Nixon was setting up
a campaign to gain back his
credibility. I feel that such late
endeavors will prove futile. His
credibility is irretrievable for Mr.
Nixon has pushed the people one
step -too‘ far.

When the American people
reacted unfavourably to the Presi-
dent’s firing of Archibald Cox,
Nixon stated that the White House,
“miscalculated the peoples’ re-
action." How else did he expect
the people‘ to react, when the
President would not comply with
a court order? If he did not
anticipate this reaction from the
people,'he grossly underestimated
the public’s intelligence.

With cries for resignation or
impeachment increasing, Nixon
decided to hold a press conference
in an effort to gain public
confidence. Well aware that this

conference could "either detract»

from or contribute to his public

image, he lost his temper and hotly -

insulted the press. _
This action lost the press
conference for him, and he stormed

Tithe-iﬁitt £21335 

"66 Y°"" 0/ c°u°!'l¢‘° 1°“"W”"'3" University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

out of the conference in a fury. Not V

only did he storm out on reporters
present, but he also stormed out on
the millions of Americans watching
him on nationwide television.

In finally complying with the court
order, Nixon made it public that
two of the most vital tapes never
existed. Did the President really
believe that the people would
accept that story? It was later
revealed that the fact that the tapes
were missing was discovered
almost a month before. If the
President had acted responsibly he
would have made this information
public then. Also, if the tapes had
any chance of containing matters of

‘national security, he should have

had his ﬁnger on them at all times.

Now, it has been announced that a
third tape does not exist. At the
same time, Nixon
Congress for breakfast to repair the
communication lines. The com-
munication lines between the
President and the people have been
irreparably cut.

President Nixon has tampered
with one of the most sacred things
a president can have--the public’s
trust, and now he is doomed.

BAS Missing  
in Teach-in

Dear Editor: '

' I find it "very curious that the
"student organization which was

once at the‘ vanguard of the

_struggle against .‘institutional

racism’ at this University is not
taking an active role in the
‘Teach-In Against Racism at Pitt.’

In looking at the schedule for this
eventas listed in the Pitt News of
Wednesday, 31 October 1973, I
noticed that one organization is
conspicuously absent -- the ‘Black
Action Society (BAS). On the basis
of my admittedly ‘limited imf6rma-
it would seem that the

1. _Here is another example of
attempts by Euro-Americans to
provide direction for peoples of

‘ color; and/or

2. Here is an example of an
attempt by disaffected liberals qua
so-called leftists/radicals "to pro-
vide direction for peoples of color;
and/or L .

3. Here is an example of

complacency in action on the part

of peoples of color who on the basis
of an assessment of present
objective reality here at this
University_ have come to the
conclusion that ‘all is well;’ and/ or
finally, ‘ .

4. Here is an example of a

situation in _which peoples of color
after due deliberation have con-
cluded that (a) the present situation ‘
does not merit their (our) involve-
ment and/or (b), their exists an
incipient distrust of coalescing with
so-called leftists who in the final‘
analysis may not be as serious in
their opposition to racism as they
would lead others to believe.

The ‘Teach-In Against Racism at
Pitt’ and the concomitant non-

involvement of the BAS (at least

explicitly)V point to two obvious
conclusions: (1) the Euro-
American left has now placed the
struggle against racism very high

on its agenda, or at least that is .

what appears to be the case; and
(2) the BAS does not view this
so-called ‘Teach-In’ as a very
significant event and- therefore
does not see its involvement as
significant.
draw two further conclusions: (3)
creeping ‘neo-paternalism’ in the
guise ofleftist indignation is on the
rise and (4)‘this time there exists a
BAS to take up the struggle against

racism yet it has allowed this task .

to be usurped by others. Perhaps
we deserve what we allow to
happen and perhaps the current
‘struggle’ against racism at this
University is actually a sham.

PS: Now all of the above rests on
the assumption that racism in fact
exists at this University, a

\ condition that no student group, has

recently documented.

Pro-life

Dear Editor:

If "I may, concerning an article
(“Debators Agree: Don’t Get
Pregnant") in The Pitt News on
Nov. 9, 1973, by a Mr. Bill Haduck,
I would like both to formally
apologize to him if his article
initially struck me as setting me up
to look like a banana, foot-peeling
chimp, and to make just a few
comments. I

‘First of all, the type setter made
a striking mistake by having

"‘pro-abortion spokesman” under ‘
‘my picture. As I preceive it, it was
"an accident, but let me say that

there is no greater insult to us in

pro-abortion. And, having initially

‘reacted to the article, to ﬁnally
speak to Mr. Haduck personally,

certain misunderstandings were
resolved. ’ ‘ 1

Rush talked, joke after joke, for at
least an hour. “Nothing is like it is.
“You know, Clearasil causes
pimples. When they took Star Trek
off the air in New York there was a
freak convention and they tried to
get it back on the air. I always get
excited about Spock, Leonard
Nimoy. He’s the perfect thinker
you know, but in person he’s such a
disappointment--he’s human.”

“I think the campus audiences are
generally more receptive than they
were just a few years ago. 4 I
remember I did some Catholic
jokes at Farleigh-Dickinson, and
one girl walked out.” '

Rush satirizes everything, from
television advertising to the W0-
men's liberation movement. But it
isn't a question of is nothing
sacred. “I think Archie Bunker, in
All in the Family, has expanded the
censorship line as far as I’d like it
to go. But twhn I go on television
they (the FCC) still censor me: I

i can’t talk about drugs, f abortion,

and sex without being cut. I’ve
turned down one'In Concert and
two Johnny Carson shows because

A of censorship."

' But most of" Rush’s conversation
isn’t a heavy rap. It’s more like a
string of punch lines. “Talking
about pomo...Did you "know that

when Roy Rogers’ horse Trigger’

died they had ‘him stuffed and put
him in the living room? At

Christmas they put a light on his
nose. How could they do that to an
old friend? Imean he’s gone, let
him go. What if you did that with
your Uncle Harry? Imagine stuffed
Uncle Harry as a doorstop.”

Pittsburgh: “Tonight I was
counting on being in a city for a
change. Ohpwell.”

“What really gets me is that
guy in the toilet bowl. I can just see
him in the middle of a conversa-
tion, ‘Hey, you want to ‘surf, I’l1

flush.”’
Rush is an entertainer in a new-

line of entertainers who is satiric
for the humor of satire. He isn’t
out to reform the world or clamor
for the renomination of George
McGovern. In that sense a new
comedy’ is arriving--where you can
believe what you believe as long as
evangelism is tempered with a

-“circumspect look, a third eye, to

how you believe.

Sonia Sanchez, noted black poet
and former Pitt teacher, recited her
poetry Wednesday, much of it
depicting the plight of the black
manin the past and today. i

“The black slave was the mental
mistress of America,” she said,
“and the mental plantation of the
1800s still exists today.

“The 19605 was much like the
1860s. In the 1860s we had the
Emancipation Proclamation - in the
19605 we had civil rights laws. In
the 1860s we had reconstruction -
in the 1960s we had the Great
Society." '

Sanchez characterized civil
rights laws as ‘~‘an admission that
blacks_'were being repressed and
deprived.

“Today we have almost no
control over our lives and the
education of our children. The
fringe beneﬁts this country gives
us will not suffice,” she added
referring to-social programs.

‘Sanchez called on black students
for more unity and more action.
“America pushes division among
minority peoples,” she said.

reservation to create a sensitive,
moving look at society’s restric-

illicit love affair between Giovanni
and his sister Annabella, the heirs
of an obviously noble and wealthy
family. A V '
Giovanni is the focus. He ﬁnds he

the pair are commanded by the
Church to part and the girl to
marry. It's interesting to note that
the priest places the burden of guilt
on Annabella, and commands
marriage instead of the usual harsh
and fatal public penance because of
the family’s stature. So much for
equality.

The marriage doesn’t work, and
when the unwary husband dis-
covers his bride is several months
pregnant after their first bedrom
success, he suspects something. Of
course, she refuses to name the
father while being beaten, and is
allowed to carry the full brunt of
pain for her brother’s and her sins.

= Her enraged husband proposes to
 invite her entire family-cousins and
_Vall--to, a banquet where they shall

all die for foisting a’non-virgin on
him. _ \ '_ '

Here the ﬂick gets to be a» bit
much. Giovanni kills his sister “to
protect her honor,” cutting out her
heart and ﬂinging it before her
-husband and the astonished
banquet guests. A huge slaughter,
one that Sam Peckinpah wouldbe
proud of, results leaving a
not-too-satisfying ending.

The ending is over-sensational
and gory, andgdoesn’t say much

more than incest is a ,n.o_-no. The

consequences of such a seemingly
innocent, yet forbidden, love are
quite formidable, but the film fails
to state a definite correlation of
guilt, love and inevitable punish-

ment, which‘ is overwrought and

seemingly unjust.

This is certainly not a film for the
faint-hearted or easily offended,
although it’s quite tasteful under
the circumstances. The photo-
graphy is striking, and A often
beautiful in shots of a hazy morning
in an Italian marsh, quite remini -
scent of Zefferelli’s work. As in the
well scene, it’s sometimes heavy-
handed in dealing with the pain
and guilt, but this can be easily
overlooked.

The acting, while nothing to write
home about, is more than sufficient
in the delicacy needed to handle
this subject. The two sibling lovers
don’t look enough alike to be
effective in reminding the audience

that this is a family affair, but.

perhaps that couldn’t be helped.

‘But it ‘would have been more

striking in its portrayal of incest
had the .two actually looked like
brother and sister. After seeing
these two, it’s quite easy to see
how they could fall in love.

A rather sickly ﬂute, a cliche in
these Old World romances, pro-

vides most of the‘ background’

music. There was definitely room
for improvement here.
Tis A Pity She’s A Whore is a

rather interesting film for a unique
look at a forbidden subject.‘ Just‘

don’t look'for “deeper” meanings

Thanks I

A coBear99

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Casimir Myslinski and Johnny Majors ought to get together and
write Paul ‘Bear’ Bryant of Alabma a thank you note. They should thak
the Bear for challenging Notre Dame to a Sugar Bowl clash.

In openly asking the Irish to play the Crimson Tide, Bryant forced a
pairing in the rest of the Bowls. Soon after Bryant’s challenge,
Louisiana State challenged Penn State to meet .them in the Orange
Bowl. Then the rest of the Bowls began to shape up.

When Tulane made it know that they wanted to play Houston in the
Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl, the Fiesta Bowl decided it was interested in
Pitt. Fiesta was hoping to land either Houston or Tulane to play their
Western Conference champion, but the two Southern teams meeting in
Houston was natural.

This is not to say, however, that the Panthers would have not
received a bid. Rather it speeded up the process, enabling the

Majorites to know of the interest early this week. '
:1: =1: an: as . A >1:

IIT-.~

 

At first it seemed that Bryant’s tactics were meant to remove the
necessity of Bowl Committees. In essence, what Bryant did was invite
himself to the Sugar. But Liberty Bowl committee member Hubie
Hunt, who visited. Pittsburgh to scout Pitt against Notre Dame,
welcomed the coach’s move.

“With a high ranked team challenging another highly ranked team,
it may be theibest way of coming up with a National Champion,” Hunt
noted. “With the big schools making sure they would play someone
close to them in the rankings, the race is on to the No. 1 spot.”

With this in mind, maybe everyone who blames the NCAA for not
coming up with a solid plan to becoming number one, ought to drop
Bryant a note of thanks, too. '

* * * * *

Who would have thought that at this time in Johnny Majors’ first
year here, all he would have to do to go to a Bowl Game was beat Army
tomorrow.

Majors and his staff should receive a deserved bonus for their
excellentjob. That is of course, unless the Cats fail to beat the Cadets.
=1: :1: =1: ax: >1:

If the Panthers are expecting Army to flip over and die, they might
be in for a big surprise. Army is as stubborn as the mule that mascots
them. Army has played a murderous schedule and with quarterback
Jim Finks at the helm, are capable of moving the ball and scoring.
Michie Stadium is a snake pit too. A perfect site for an ambush.

However, with the first winning season in ten years. and a Bowl
staring them in the face, Majors‘ boys should enjoy a pleasant romp.
The chance for a letdown is nill. '

an :1: ate, :1: =1:

Would you believe that Pitt could find itself in the top ten by
Christmas. Well, if they win their next three games--Army, Penn State
(the sixth ranked team in the country), and either Arizona (19th) or
Arizona State (12th)--this could very well happen.

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

A literal Fiesta could take place
tomorrow on the Pitt Panthers
plane ride back from West
Point--providing that the Cats can

"handle the Army Cadets with ease.

An invitation to the Fiesta Bowl will
be in order if Johnny Majors and
his troops can clinch Pitt’s first
winningseason since 1963 with a
win at Michie Stadium.

After a wild week of bowl bids
being handed out or actually
claimed before the designated date
for formal invitations to be
extended, Pitt has been dropped
from some lists and added to
others. -

Last week at this time, it looked
like Pitt could very well have been
headed for either the Liberty or Sun
Bowls.‘ But after the 31-10 loss to
Notre Dame, those possibilities
seemed to vanish into thin air. And
just as quickly as those two
disappeared. two more post season

Over  

The Fiesta Bowl has listed
Pittsburgh as the top candidate to
face the winner of the Western
Athletic Conference, either Arizona
or Arizona State. Also indicating
that Pitt is on the list of perspective
candidates was the Peach Bowl
committee, which let that fact_ slip
to _the media on Wednesday.

The Peach Bowl listed Pitt as
high on their list of potential
candidates but it's fact that Majors
will grab the first bid that comes
his way. As he said to Tuesday's
press luncheon audience, “A bird
in the hand is worth two in the
field.”

And the Fiesta Bowl will be
worth somewhere around $180,000
to the University of Pittsburgh.

But there was something else
that Majors’ stressed, something
that he has harped on time and
time again throughout the season.
First things come first and that
means that the Panthers will be
looking no farther aheadthan the
Army Cadets.

With the Cadets, Pitt will once
again face a team that has not won
a ball game in the 1973 season so
far. Army is 0-8 and is definitely
up against the wall when it comes

to their chances of winning a game ‘

this year. After Pitt. the Cadets
have only one game remaining and

. that is the traditional classic with

Navy.’

Itidl Shows Off
73-74 Hoop Squad 

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

Pitt head basketball coach Buzz

Ridl unveiled his 1973-74 squad to
the news media at the Field House
yesterday.

‘The srquad has been working out
nightly for a month in preparation
for the 26-game season which
begins December 1 at West
Virginia. A A

With only three lettermAan lost
from last year’s squad, one would
think that Ridl will have no
problems in selecting a lineup and
traveling squad. The opposite is
true.

“Things are still wide open,” he
said as the team ran through its
warmup drills. “There’s about ten
players battling for positions.”

Ridle emphasized that he is
looking for about eight players to
“carry the load.” His traveling
squad will consist of about ten
players. 1

“In modern college basketball,
you can't go with five men for the
whole game," he said. “Playing
ten or twelve a game is not
practical either."

The one man that everybody
knows will be in the lineup on
opening day is Bill “Mooney”
Knight. Knight is being mentioned
as an All-American candidate in
this, his senior year, as he has been
in previous years. I

The 6-6‘/2 forward has averaged
22.4 points per game over the last
two years, and 11.2 rebounds. He
has 133 assists. and has fouled out
of only two games.

Knight needs only 53 points to
become Pitt's second highest
scorer in history, and could surpass

leader Don Hennon, who scored
1841. Knight is currently in ﬁfth
place with 1122 points.

Unlike the mononucleosis-riddled

Duquense Dukes, the Panthers are
in good physical shape for the start
of the season. Forwards Jim Bolla
and John Endsley had bouts with
viruses recently, but have re-
covered.

“The key to our success will be
winning the. close games," said
Ridle. “We lost alot of them last
year, and how we play those will
determine hownwell we do."

The hooperswill play their annual
Blue-Gold game on Wednesday,
November 28 at the Field House.
Students will be admitted free-

I I ‘Eye Third Win

Skaters Battle Vinnies

‘Eyeing their second league.

victory and third win in a row, the
Pitt Hockey Club faces St. Vincents
College Sunday night at Kirk Nevin
Arena in Greensburg, Pa.

Scouting reports ﬁled by freshman

wing Rick Vernon tab St. Vincents
’ as an extremely physical team.

“V «The Vinnies boast some rather

large skaters that play their
positions well, especially when the
action is in their end of the rink.
That could very well pose some
problems for the Pitt skaters in
their attempt to play straight
hockey and lay off the fisticuffs. If
any team in the Western Pa.
Intercollegiate Hockey Association
plays a rough style, it is Pitt. But
that's not saying that the Pitt
skaters are over—anxious to drop
the gloves and go a few rounds.
In fact, coach Len Barcawlo has
expressed extreme concern over
his squad’s growing reputation as

Egggbrawlers. He has made it clear that

anyone on the club that is the
instigator in a bench. emptying
brawl might not be in uniform for
the following game.

Booters’
Against Penn State

. BY YAIER LEHRER
There is a lot more at stake in
tonight’s soccer game with Penn
State than just a win or loss. It

reaches far deeper than that. It is a "

matter of pride.

The Panthers tied Penn State at
Pitt stadium last year, 0-0, and the
Nittany Lions went back to State
College swearing up and down that
they shouldn't have tied theCats.
They went so far as to say that the
Panthers were not even in their
class as a soccer team.

The 0-0 tie proved otherwise and
the Booters are going to be out to
prove it again to the Lions at State
College tonight.

But the trend of the team seems
to be turning, from all indications
of the Pitt-Villanova contest. Pitt
got down to just playing hockey and
kept the game in control in all
respects. The tempers of the Pitt
skaters as well as the Vinnies may
get a firm test on Sunday.

Last year Pitt handled St.
Vincent with ease during the
regular season but did have some
trouble in theopening round of the
playoffs. Pitt won that game, 3-2 in
sudden death overtime, but not
until St. Vincents’ goaltender Andy
Labraska put on a one man show.
Labraska utilizes his rotund
physique in a flopping style of play
while depending on his quick glove
hand to control any possible
rebounds.

Center Charly Hagins will be in
action for Pitt after taking five
stitches under his right eye from a
crosscheck he received in the
Villanova game. Hagins leads the
team in scoring with six goalspand
an assist for seven points. Last
year’s top point getter was Denny
Browne, Iinemate with Hagins. So

Defenseman Duke Shaeffer and

three times. Cummings, Vernon,
Joe Testa and Browne are right
behind Hagins in total points, each
having four so far this season.

Pitt will have a two week layoff
due to the Thanksgiving recess
before taking to the ice again. The
skaters will play their ﬁrst game in
the Civic Arena on December 2

, - Chester to a 1-1 tie. The Lions lost

3-1 to West Virginia, while the Cats
only lost 2-0 to the Mountaineers,

’ O so it shapes up to be a close battle.

“We should have beaten West
Chester and Temple,” said "Coach

Bemis. Temple beat Pitt 2-1 while‘

they tied Penn State 1-1. We got
some bad breaks, but we really
outplayed both those teams.” '
According to Bemis, this has
been the story of the Pitt soccer
team all season long, with bad

. breaks costing them some close

games. “The team feels snake-
bitten," said Bemis.
that no matter how they play, some
break is going to cost them the
game."

The team cannot afford to be
snake-bitten again_ because they
are playing a tough team; any one
mistake could cost them the game.
Everyone on the team knows that,
especially the seniors.

This is‘ the last game for the

T seniors on the team. For players

like Joe Luxbacher and Denny
Kohlmyer, it will be the last chance
for them to prove to Penn State that
they are at least in the same class
with them, hopefully better, and
they especially don't want to end
their college careers with a loss.
Joe Luxbacher and Denny
Kohlmyer were named to the
West Penn first team All-Stars,
with Fernando Carriquiry cap-
turing second team honors.
Fernando might even try to prove
that not only does he belong on the
ﬁrst team, but that he is the best

fullback in the West Penn

Conference, which he probably is. '

There is no question, though,
that if Pitt wants to win this game,
they’ll have to play probably the
hardest game that they have all
season, and play with more desire
than before, and above all not be
overconfident.

Overconfidence has been a
great fault of the Booters and has
cost them countless games against
their West Penn opponents. How
else do you explain that Pitt
defeated Point Park, the same team
who defeated every other Western
Penn team that they faced,
including Edinboro, which Pitt lost
to.

The Cats are coming off a loss to
Indiana University on a very
dubious goal which gave Indiana a
1-0 win at home destroying Pitt’s
hopes for a winning season. The
Booters still want this game very
badly.

Today almost everybody is getting into photography
And it's not the snapshot variety. People are doing
sports stories, nature stories. portraits—you may _
even have a friend who’s doing photographs through
a microscope. Or a telescope. .1

You also know that everybody has his own idea
about which camera is best. That's why it's important
for you to know about the Canon F-1. Because it’s the
system camera that's fast becoming the favorite of ~
professionals. And the new status symbol among
photography enthusiasts. . “ '

sure you get it.

Because it was conceived from the beginning as a
system, it works as a system. All the elements are
quickly and easily interchangeable. No matter which
lens or accessory you use with the F-1 body you won't
have the feeling that something has been

“tacked on."

What's more the F-1 is comfortable to handle.

Years of research went into the design of the F-1 body
and placement of controls so your fingers fall
naturally into place. You‘ll appreciate this comfort
when you’re on assignment. It's also an important
thing to keep in mind if you’re,investing in a camera

you plan to keep a long time.

Canon has_been in the optics industry over 37
years. We make microscope equipment, amateur and
professional movie cameras and TV lenses. It's this
experience that helps make our still cameras the best
selling cameras in Japan. In America, it‘s just a matter

of time.

See your dealer for more information. He'll also
show you Canon’s other SLR cameras, like the FTb ,
and TLb. Both of which offer accurate metering. easy
filmloading. a wide range of lenses and the same
standard of engineering that goes into the F-1.

The whole F-1 system includes over 40 lenses and
