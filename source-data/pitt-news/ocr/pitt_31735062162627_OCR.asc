f Editor, the Pitt News:

Last week, as in past years,
a group of high school students
.outcheered the student body of
this university. These high
school students had no connec-
tion with the university other

than being guests of the univer-

sity on Band Day.
cheered more for our team than
our own student body did.

It is a tribute to this univers-
ity to have a student body that
obtains this honor each year.

This lack of school spirit is a
very noticeable detriment to the

character of the student body as.

a whole. I am sure that this
flaw in the character of the stu-
dent body is noticed by persons
outside of this university as well
‘as within it.

Win, lose or draw, it is our
team, and it represents ~ our
"school. Anyone who thinks he
can to better than they should

stead of up in the stands gath-

 Letters To The Editor

Yet they '

ering dust — if they even go to‘

the games.

The athletic teams represent-
ing your school deserve the sup-
port of the student body; or
maybe we should have Band
Day more often and l.et a group
of high school students make up
for the lack of interest of our
student body.

A group has been formed here
at the university to get rid of
‘the deﬁciency in school spirit.
This is a group that has been

I ‘subjected to a wide variety of

comments in the past few weeks.
But no matter what the com-
ments were, it still stands that
this minority group outcheered
the rest of the student body.

The group has grown consid- ’

erably in size since its forma-
tion. An even larger group is
expected‘ for this Saturday's
game. Many persons are joining

     

“Block E” to help cheer: for a
team that deserves the support

Wear , Dresses, Heels,

Freshman Girl Says

Editor, the .Pitt News: ,

The girls on this campus do
not dress properly,. or decently.
It is a sorry fact that girls are
allowed to wear bermudas, even
in the Schenley cafeteria and in
the student lounge, and now
they are asking permission to
wear slacks.

Instead of granting this con-
cession, -AWS should stop the
whole thing. It is apparent that
many girls in this school were
not brought up‘ any better than
to be sloppy in public; often
times‘ I believe they dress in
such a way as to be suggestive.

This should bestopped alto-
gether; It is only ﬁtting that col-
lege women be on a par with girls
who have gone into the business
world. Indeed, I see no reason
why women students should not
be required to wear high heels
and dresses when on the campus.

Summer Report 7 . '.‘  R

By David Breoksfone
A song titled “Ciao, Ciao, Mambino” has been
popular in Italy for the past few years. During
the two and one-half weeks I spent in that ab-

' sorbing country, I "must have heard that" senti-

mental/ballad 50 times, in-the
arcades, outside cafes, on the
streets. Now, when I recall
something that occurred while I _
was in. Italy, I invariably hear
that tune lilting ‘in my mind.
What amuses me about “Ciao,
Ciao, Bambino” is its English
translation, which is so Ameri-
can: “Bye, Bye, Baby.”

I ﬁrst heard the song in
“Galleria,” a beautiful-
cross-shaped arcade of cafes and ‘
ﬁne shops- In the evenings, the Milanese sit in
the simple elegance of the gaily "lit cafes, listen
to the music of violins and arclear, young voice,
and watch the tourists stream by. Tourists often

. prefer to explore a city in the evening and early

morning _because that’s about the only time to
escape, the angry summer sun.

At night in Milan, the huge cathedral, “The
Duomo,” is illuminated with ﬂoodlights. A city
block square, the church is done in the ﬂam-

_ boyant Gothic style, its facade and roof fairly

bristling with towers and ornamental statues.

During the day, one visits the simple interior of
the church: goes to the Brera Art Gallery, troops
through the vast ‘castle of the Sforza family, and
inevitably winds up in the old refectory of the
Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie.

On the far wall of this rectangular room‘ is
Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper,” perhaps
the most A famous single painting in the western
world. Though broken by the" war and badly
faded by the eraser of’ time, it retains its; power
to enrapture the .viewer.

Perception Through fainting , ,

The crucial moment of the Christian epic has
been captured with -such rare perception and artis-
tic precision that I am tempted to believe that this
work, by itself, proves da Vinci to ‘be the greatest
man of the Renaissance. That. maybe a sophomoric

claim, but the profound understanding of human’

character which the artist‘ displays will make any

‘critic think carefully. before attacking this con-.

tention. < , A

We were traveling
Dauphine, a red one. After two days in Milan we
darted across the east—west Autostrada, a kind of
two—lane, continental, “superhighway,” to ‘Venice.
If any one cityin Italy can thoroughly convince
the over-ambitious writer that he is simply wast-
ing his time in trying to describe even _poorly, his
travels, it is Venice. Only during the ‘all-too-swift
time that I was actually there did I concede" that
such a city existed, and that the people’ I saw
around me were not phantoms. ‘

We left our car in a Golden Triangle—like park-.

ing garage at the edge of the island and got on a
“water streetcar” to get to town. As we moved
swishingly up the Grand Canal, the gondoliers in
striped boat-neckedjerseys and red-ribboned straw

Facets of Wisdom . . . '

Not for Kn

By Ina Amdur V
Every once in a while it is worthwhile for stu-
dents to evaluate why they are.in college. Fulﬁll-
ing the all-mighty ﬁeld-distributions, pilling up the
requisite number of credits -each semester, - and

sitting in the subterranean Tuck_ Shop each day ~

cannot be the be-all and the end-
all of college. There" must be
something beyond this, some un4
derstanding of life itself, which
the college student is searching
for.

The understanding of life
cannot be gained without a sense
of the past. By this is not meant
the knowledge of dates and of
institutions but the awareness
that one is only a link from past
civilization to future ones. Man’s problems con-
cerning himself have always been the same. He
has always wondered how to meet death, how to
ﬁnd the summum ‘bonum in life, why good men
suffer evil, and how to love. The problems remain
and only ways of solving them differ.
crystallize Creed

College is also the time for re-evaluation of
values which one’s culture and one’s immediate
environment have preached. This may involve
wondering whether ‘materialism as practiced in
America is the best way of -life, or whether one’s
own‘ religion is ipso facto'~the ‘best’ religion. Form-

hats were slowly plying their black, high-prowed
barks through the dark water swirling with debris.
"When we arrived at the Piazza San Marco we

\v‘

descended and raced through the narrow streets ’

to the square. Squatting massively at the head of
the piazza is the Church of San Marco, in all its
Byzantine-European opulence. Beside it, the pink-
stoned Palace of the Doges hovers in protective
mefjesty. _

By night, the canals and lights and far—away
music combine to produce a ﬁercely romantic at-
mosphere. The facades of the lavish Renaissance
houses on the Grand Canal are dancing with
colored lights, and a gondola glide with guitar and‘
singing is one of the beautiful illusions that the
impressionable always remember. . _

And so to Florence through the rolling, tree-
blanketed hills of Tuscany. As the road becomes
lined with stately poplars, nodding in the warm
wind, we realize that “Firenze,” as the Italians
call it, was not far. "When the valley of the Arno
ﬁnally appeared, with city ‘nestled on its banks,
I wondered idly if I would be disappointed with

this home of the Italian Renaissance, the old vault
' of humanism. ’

We hadn’t been in Florence for more than six
hours when I discovered an electric, intensely alive
quality about the place: the bustling, jammed
streets, the cries of vendors, historic buildings and
statues literally around every corner, strange names
blinking from the signs in strangely aromatic
restaurants. . A 0

To say that the wealth of art and history in the
Ufﬁzi Gallery, the Bargello, the Pitti Palace, the

"stupendous churches, ad inﬁnitum, is awe—inspir-

ing is to be guilty of gross understatement. Let it

sufﬁce to say that as we drove regretfully away‘

from Florence ‘six days later, I was sure that ’

Lorenzo, the Magniﬁcent, would be standing in the
gateway of the Medici palace calling out “Arrive-
derci!” * -

Rome Recalled‘ A ' > -_

- Rome is the Rome of the Latin books we used
in high school, imperial, the home of Caesar,,_the
scene of ‘monuments which still remind men of the
grandeur of empire. "Rome is vast, sprawling, very
much of a meeting grounds ‘for East .and West,

Michaelangelo’s “Moses” in that crumbling old

the story of World War II genocide in the brutal
numbers chiseled into its entrance wall. The ruins
of the baths of Diocletian and Caracalla stand
ominous in the fading twilight of“ a hot summer
day. Outside the city, Pope John plays his part
in the welcoming business by meeting_ tourists
twice /a week in CastelGandolfo. The Marshall
Plan railroad terminal is built over the walls; of
the old imperial city, and if you visit the base-
ment shops, you ﬁnd the huge ten—feet thick

It involves thought, uexramination, and a. deal
of honesty. ‘ - ’ - - " »

Once this creed has been developed,‘ college.
can teach the students‘ how. to defend it at all

costs. There are, many social situations on campus ‘

which test one’s c're,ed. in action. To withstand

_ the disapproval of others _in college is a necessary

preface to withstanding"'thep disapproval? ‘of ‘others

Although an understanding of why a human
being acts a certain way does not necessarily en-
gender love of that human being, it does lead -to
a sense of compassion for all human beings who
are impotent against circumstances stronger than”
themselves. ‘ ' ~

It seems, then, that what is really desired from C

college is not knowledge but wisdom. Knowledge

is deﬁnedas the “acquaintance with facts and prin-

ciples.” Wisdom is deﬁned as the “knowledge, of .

  Special SGA Committee
To Reconstruct Set-Up

 

 

(Continued from Page 1)
the general planning of the Com-
mission.

“The first of the sub-com-
mittees, ‘the committee on re-
view, has already considered the
present state of student govern-
ment, and the manner in which
its legal structure could be im-
proved, with. particular empha-
sis on the areas not included in
the deﬁnition of the more’ spe-
ciﬁc committees.”

Turner stated that the second
committee, on structure, has, along
with the committees on review
and membership, already sub-
mitted its report.”

Structure Considered

The structure committee dis-
cussed the proper legal structure‘
of S.G.A. under a trimester system
with special emphasis on the na-

 ture of the proposed government

and the constitutional framework
under..which it can be best
achieved. '

“The committee on member-
ship,” said Turner, “considered
the membership of- student gov-
ernment and possible schedules
of elections and appointments
under a trimester system with
emphasis on minimal confusion
and maximal continuity of serv-
ice.”

- These three sub-committee re-

ports, compiled and reviewed since
last April, have been submitted to
the ﬁnal commission sub—division:
the drafting committee. '
Master Planelteadied

This committee, consisting of
Turner, Kent Jarrell, Lois Capin,
Lee Thompson and Dick Dodds, is
presently considering the three
reports and will combine the ‘sug-
-gestions in a- master plan which
will then be turned < over to the

I _-,3,/entire Trimester Commission.

 

 

I ’ WRITERS’ B U R E AVU, b

Upon their approval, which is
expected early next month, the
plan will be announced to
S.G.A.. and the public. When
askedto divulge what plan was‘
considered most favorable at
the present time by him, Chair-
man Turner made the following
statement: ‘ 9- "

“The plan that I feel offers con-
siderable promise suggests a stu-
dent government of greater in-
fluence and protection. It calls for
the clear division of the functions
of government, into the familiar
legislative, executive, and - judicial
branches, all being co-equal and
inter-related by a variety of
mechanisms". '.

Legal Branch ? ? ? ? -

"The legislative branch, for ex-
ample, would be concerned with
policy and the general supervision
of student government.

“/It would have active, legisla-
tive committees, be presided over
by‘ ‘the "president or ‘vice’ president

' of the student body, and it would i

the executive branch for conﬁr- .

mation and implementation.

“The executive branch, would,
under this plan, be headed by a
president and vice -president of
the student body and would di-
rect the administration of stu-
dent government ‘programs.

“The president would be the
titular head of the student body,
and, in addition, would appoint

"heads of the several administra-

tive areas, with the advice and
consent of the legislature.
Prexy To Be Ready

‘.‘It has also been suggested that

the president would serve on a

year—round basis or appoint some-

one to serve in his place, in or er

to provide for the constant func-

tioning of student government.

“Obviously, th e judiciary

would serve as a student court,
and as a body to settle consti-
tutional issues’ that may arise.
Members of this court would be

appointed by the president and
approved by the legislature,“
serving, perhaps, for a term of

two years.

Panther Future Becoming Dim

 AS Tougher Games Approach
Team I11 Good Physical Shape;

Cunningham Doubtful Starter

By TED
The future looks dim for

COLTLON
Coach John Miche1osen’s grid-

ders who now are in the midst of what the “experts” call

the rough part of the schedul

e with only a 3-3 record. Syra-

cuse oﬁers the Cats the chance to make that record 3-4 ‘Sat-

urday at the Stadium as the

Orange bring to town one of

the strongest teams in the nation.

With two consecutivelosses the
Panthers will try to get back on
the win column as they go
through theirpaces preparing for
the Orange.

The Cats are in good physical
shape as there were no serious
injuries in the TCU game. The
only two injuries at all were two
minor‘ injuries to Larry Vignali
and Fred Riddle. Both boys will
be ready for Syracuse.

Kuzneski, Mills Sparkling
Jim Cunningham, who was
feared,lost for the season, has
started working out, but it is
doubtful that he will be ready
by Saturday.

Although the Cats have lost
their last two games, a couple
of the Cats have been improv-
ing with every game. Andy

,Kuzneski and Dick Mills have

looked outstanding in the last
several games.

9

Kuzneski, a sophomore from
Indiana, plays the linebacker spot
and has made several key plays
for the Panthers. He may not be
the fastest line-backer but he
makes up with _hustle what he
-lacks in ability. He should be a
good one for the Cats for the
next two years.

Pass Defense Improves '
,Mills, a senior from Beaver, al-
most won the West Virginia game
all by himself as he scored a
touchdown and saved one _when
he caught a Mountaineer back
from behind.‘ Mills plays either

tackle and weighs 230 pounds.

The Cats have been looking im-
proved on their pass defense and
running attack but their passing
game has gone bad in the last
two games. If they can get all
three of these departments going
at once Syracuse better look out.
