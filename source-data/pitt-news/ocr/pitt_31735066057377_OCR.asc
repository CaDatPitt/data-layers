Cable installation delayed

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Bruce Hall and McCormick
Hall residents may not get
cable television until next
semester, according to Pitt’s
Housing Services director,
Robert Hopkins.

Hopkins said if students
living in Bruce and
McCormick do not want
Housing Services to drill
holes for cable wires, then
they must wait for a break in
the semester for the installa-

tion.

“If they don’t mind putting
up with the noise and the
dirt, then we’ll go ahead,” he
said.

Numerous residents and
resident assistants living in
the two halls have called
Housing Services, according
to Hopkins, to ask why they
still have only basic service.
Hopkins previously told The
Pitt News that every resi-
dence hall had cable TV.

“When the information ran
[in the Aug. 31 issue], there

still was every intention to
have it in before classes start-
ed,” Hopkins said, “but” we
were unable to complete it.”

“We hoped to get it done,
but we just ran out of time,”
he said.

Bruce Hall resident Lee
Bannister said he wants cable
now and that he wouldn’t
mind the dirt and the noise at
all.

“We were told that all that
stuff [the drilling] would
happen during the day,” he

SGB is

It’s the gavel.

Just ask Elizabeth
Mania, the president
pro tempore of the
Student Government
Board. A symbol of

.justice and the
insignia of the SGB,
the gavel is an intimi-
dating element that
easily misrepresents
the members. '

“When I was a
freshman, I. saw the
advertisement for
Freshman Council,
and there was the
gavel,” Mania said.
“When I saw the
gavel, I was like,
‘Ooh, I don’t know if
this is for me.”’

It is misconceptions
like this which many
of the SGB members
are trying to alleviate.
Generally, there are
various stereotypes
and misconceptions

‘ that are held by the
majority of the stu-
dent body. A familiar
one for Mania is that
the members are an
elite group of stu-

dents.
“We are just normal
students. Our sole

purpose is to repre-

Pitt doctors make house calls to the elderly

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

Just like in “Little House on
the Prairie,” doctors at Pitt now
make house calls.

The In-Home Geriatric
Support Program, run by Pitt’s
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic, sends a team of doc-
tors and technicians to the

homes of elderly mentally ill
patients. .

“The In-Home Geriatric
Support Services Program
offers enormous benefits for
patients who have been unable
or unwilling to seek treatment in
a clinical outpatient setting,”
said Richard Morycz, a clinical
administrator of the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s

Geriatric Health Services.

“It is a program that provides
psychiatric, medical and social
services to people over 60 years
old, and it is given to them at
home,” added Bridget Booth,
the program coordinator.

The program started in May
and currently has around 40
patients. However, there are
plans to expand the program,

according to Booth.

“We started at the end of May,
and we hope to be serving 96
people eventually,” Booth said.

Money from the program has
come from a grant given by the

what he is calling a “spiritual

the student inside.

Out of his 12th floor window in the Cathedral of
Learning, Wesley Posvar looked at the grounds below.
“I don’t see swarms of people on campus,” he said.

“Seems like they extended vacation.”

If anyone should know what the “norms” are at Pitt, it’s g
Posvar. He has been with the university for 27 years, most ‘
of that time as president.

In June of 1993, Pitt trustees gave Posvar the title
“President Emeritus.”

“It’s standard treatment for someone who’s been in office
a long time,” Posvar said.

J. Dennis O’Connor now holds Posvar’s former position,

only now the position has been renamed chancellor.
Posvar said he would not critique the new administration,
instead saying only that he feels comfortable with Pitt’s sta-
tus.

“The university is in very good health,” he said.

Posvar continues to inﬂuence life at Pitt. He will teach a 1 .
course called International Politics, Ideas and Power in the i
New Global Age next semester which he has taught for the 
past two years. Posvar said while most administrators— :

dent of the SGB, said. “It is students from
all areas and backgrounds that make up the
board. Some are resident assistants, and
some just want to make changes.”

It is the idea and the idea alone of the
SGB that seems intimidating. The process
of being elected is a scary one, Pasquale
said.

“An election is going to be intimidating
for people,” Pasquale said. “The most
important and powerful positions here
are elected; that is definitely very intimidat-
ing.”

“There may be a slight feeling of intimida-
tion,” Heather Heinrichs, Elections
Committee chair, said.

The quantity of attention and audience
to which a candidate is subjected is only
one factor that may dissuade an individual.
It is the fear of public humiliation that sits
in the back of a person’s mind, Pasquale
said.

“When you’re being elected your name
is everywhere,” Pasquale said. “If you
lose, you feel like, ‘Oh well,’ and that per-
son that lost, everyone knows because they
lost.”

It is winning and losing that sets the intim-
idation wheel rolling, but the students who
are the candidates are the ones who are most
fearful. ‘

up,” Mania said. “At first it seemed over-
whelming, but it isn’t really that bad.”

Hard work and motivation are the basic
pre-requisites these board members have.
They want to be seen as the typical class-
mate, someone another student can talk to
and be friends with?

Pasquale and Mania emphasized that they
are ordinary students who represent the
interests of the student body, and Mania was
quick to deny that they are put on a pedestal.
She explained it as simple name recognition.

“I really think it_is the name recognition
more than anything else,” Mania said. “For
my case, it’s probably because I have a real-
ly strange name; that could be the reason
too.”

With a friendly smile, Mania offered an

invitation to anyone interested in student
government or a committee.
, “It would be great to see students come up
to the office,” Mania said. “They’ll see how
we interact with each other and realize that
this is a very laid back place.”

“[We have] to encourage students to come
up and speak to the board members,”
Heinrichs said.

“If any student were to come in, we’d be
more than happy to talk to them, if they had
a problem or not,” Pasquale said. “We have
numerous committees that students can

come up and be a part of.”

THE PITT PROGRAM COUNCIL  
W HAS OPENINGS FOR  
A LECTURE DIRECTOR AND
A PUBLICITY DIRECTOR!

The Pitt News, Thursday, September 15, 1994

House calls

‘From page 1
Department of Public Welfare’s
Office of Mental Health,
according to the UPMC News
Bureau. The grant is for over
$375,000 dollars, and it is
shared between UPMC’s
Benedum Geriatric Center and
the UPMC’s Living at Home
program.

Dr. Marcus Pelucio, a fourth-
year resident psychiatrist at
WPIC, is one of three resident
doctors involved with the pro-
gram.

“The main goal of the pro-
gram is to try and promote peo-
ple living at home as long as
possible,” Pelucio said. “We try
to keep them out of the hospi-
tal.”

Booth added that keeping the
patients out of hospitals will be
important in the next few years.

“With all the changes in
health care reform, there will be
a push to have more services at
home,” said Booth.

Another psychiatrist involved
with the program, Andy
Rosenzweig, said the service is
important because of its unique-
ness.

“It gives them a regular sup-
port network of people in the
psychiatric field, not just med-

ical doctors,” Rosenzweig said.
Besides keeping the patients
out of hospitals and providing
different support, the program
is extremely cost effective,
according to Morycz. This is
because of the team effort
employed by the program.
According to the UPMC
News Bureau, the team
includes a psychiatrist, a geria-
trician, a social worker, an
occupational therapist, nurses
and community workers.

During the first visit, a psychia- V

trist usually does an overall
assessment of the patient’s con-
dition. From thenon other

, workers come as needed.

“To get into the program, the
person must be over 60 and live
in Allegheny County. -They also
must have a mental illness
problem,” Booth said.

“It was designed for people
who are home-bound.
Generally, these people can’t
leave the home for physical
limitations,” added Pelucio.

Booth said she hopes the pro-
gram is long—lasting and not an

experimental one, because of

all the benefits.

“We actually bring the doctor
to the home to bring support to
the patients,” Booth said.

ture,” he said, “but it wasn’t as
difficult as it may seem. There
was a great deal of repetition.”

The repetition in the litera-
ture Posvar read may have
come from his years studying
international politics at
Harvard, where he received
his Ph.D. in’ the subject. One
of his professors at Harvard
was former U.S. Secretary of
State Hemy Kissinger.

“[Kissinger] was very diplo-
matic, brilliant and very pri-
vate, difficult to be intimate
with,” Posvar said.

As a professor, Posvar said
he is learning things about the
university he never knew
before.

“One amusing observation
as a consumer or user of Pitt is
in registration. Things aren’t
nearly as well off asl thought
 all the delays, complexities
of red tape.”

“I’m seeing [Pitt] from a
totally different perspective,”
Posvar said.

Posvar said he thinks the
controversy surrounding his
$3.3 million retirement pack-
age is behind him. »

“So much of that was a
creature of the press, of the
media,” he said. “I’l1 be happy
if I never heard it mentioned
again.”

Posvar gave more than $1
million of the package back to
Pitt and took a reduced annual
salary as part of a concession.

“The controversy [surround-
ing administrative retirement
benefits] is a very common
event, and during those years,
it was a very, very common
event. Columbia, Harvard,
Yale all went through it,” he
 /

Posvar now holds the title
“president emeritus” of the
University of Pittsburgh,
which he now holds what he
said is a “comfortable” office

on the 12th floor of the ’

Cathedral of Learning.

“The chancellor’s office is
too big to be comfortable, and
it’s not a good place to do
writing.” ’

Writing is what the former
Pitt president has been
doing a lot of since his retire-
ment in 1991. Posvar said he
has written pieces on the
space station, economic devel-
opment and his speciality,
international politics.

“I’m tempted to write an op-

ed piece on Cuba,” he said. -

There are many open com-
mittees, such as the Safety
Committee, which is a big
concern of the university.
With involvement in such
committees, there is a sense
of accomplishment, Mania
said.

“When you get involved in

these committees, there is a

sense of success and satis-
faction,” Mania said. “That
is when you want to start to
do more, knowing that you
are needed. That is what
keeps you going.”

“There are people who

want to be involved. It’s‘

not like everyone who

walks down the street is_

interested, [in SGB],”
Pasquale said. “Those who
are interested are motivated
and make it a point to get
involved.”

For Mania, running for
the board was just giving
something else a fair shot,

trying somethingnew. It I

was a chance that
became an important part of
her life.

“It is an easy way to gain
self-esteem and to lose that
fear of intimidation,” Mania
said.

The board members are
only a part of the process of
policy—making; it is a team
effort that involves the stu-
dents.

“It is all about a team
effort,” Mania said. “The
more students involved, the
better the team is. I really
think that is true.”

The office of the SGB is
not made of oakwood nor
does it resemble a court-
room. '

Bannister said that he hasn’t

Bannister said, but it also

Posvar said he is also

“I’ve talked to some big

The University of

Posvar said.

“I was finishing a book

Posvar said none of the

way he wants it.

“I believe in a distinct sepa-

Opinions
Everyone's out

Three strikes and yer out!!

No, one strike and we’re out. A group of out—of-touch bloated

owners and a bunch of spoiled, juvenilistic overpaid baseball play-‘
ers have managed to do what two world wars could not — cancel
the World Series.
C It is official, and all baseball fans are officially pissed. This had
been the best season in memory. Realignment was a success,
excitement was back in the game, a number of previously untouch-
able records were being threatened and it all came crashing down.

It is easy to say now what should have been done, but for both
sides to finally give up as quietly as they did is shocking. And who
knows when it will end? Without the possibility of ﬁnishing the
season to motivate the combatants, the strike could go on ad inﬁni-
tum. - .

Furthermore the strike goes further in threatening the future of

baseball than either .the salary cap the players whined about or the .

financial difficulties of small-market teams that the owners were
concerned about. The popularity of baseball has been waning in

recent years, especially among the nation’s youth. This exciting

season could have rectified that, but no longer. p

Ultimately it is time for the fans to send a message to the owners
and players. If, and it is a big if, there is an opening day next sea-
son, The Pitt News calls for all fans to boycott the game in protest. C

Compromise curfew  

The city of Pittsburgh is considering‘ a teenage curfew mod- _

eled after the ones in Phoenix and Denver. A curfew can be both
a blessing and a curse. It gives the police another weapon
against crime by letting them remove potentialcriminals from
the streets before they can commit any crimes. However it is
also another instrument of social repression in our already over-
ly paternalistic society. _ r —

The Pitt‘ News feels this opposing dichotomy can be recon-
ciled. Most curfews, including the ones in‘Phoenix and Denver,

6 are too broad. They allow cops to pull over individuals under 18

for driving around after ll,p.m. V

This gives too‘ much power and latitude to the police and has
also had a tendency to lead to racial discrimination;i.e. the 16-
year-old white guy can drive on, while a 16-year-old black gets
pulled over. . > J I

However, giving the police the ability to “clear the streets”
after a certain time is needed in this day and age. Street crime is
reaching unparalleled heights in Pittsburgh and across the
nation. While a curfew is far from a panacea, it will help cut
down on crime. » 7

The compromise is obvious. Pittsburgh should pass a curfew
against teenagers loitering on citystreets — with very speciﬁc
deﬁnitions of what loitering is to cut down on racial discrimina-
tion. But it should not be an all-encompassing curfew. Teenagers
should be allowed to have a night life, but for practical purposes
we must disallow them from using the streets. V

U.S. should gelout of Haiti

' ith
the
U-

nited States
preparing to
nvade Haiti,
he Clinton

 
   

Columnist J
Tony tion is desper-
Dickensheets ately trying to

. convince the
American people (and proba-

bly themselves) that an inva-

sion of Haiti is really in
America’s national interest.
Let’s look at the facts. America
invaded Haiti once before in
191.5 and ended up staying

there until 1934, only tohave

the country revert back into
chaos and dictatorship after we
left. This brings up the ‘ques-
tion of what would our mission
be this time? Well, that

[depends on who in’the admin-

istration you listen, to and on
what day.
Recently on the “Today

Show,” Leon Panetta said that

any invasion would be a rescue
mission and not a war, so it is
not riecessaryto seek congres-
sional approval. The “rescue
effort” that Panetta talked
about is “restoring democracy”
to the Haitian people. It is
ridiculous for the administra-
tion to call an invasion a rescue
operation. Our military is
going there to overthrow a
government, period. Let’s take
the administration’s points one
by one. First of all, the U.S.
military should never be used
in rescue missions. They sim-
ply aren’t trained for that line
of work. The hard reality is
that soldiers are trained to kill,
protect America and win wars.
Anybody that thinks otherwise
has never served in the military
(remind you of someone?).

I spent three years in combat
arms and_ was never once
trained to do rescue operations‘.
Leave the rescuing to organiza-
tions such as the Red Cross.

Secondly, this nonsense that
the administration is saying
about not needing congression-
al approval is clearly not true.
In recent days both The
Washington Post and The New

V.-.

J Adminigfra-,

York Times have run columns
saying that President Clinton is
required by the Constitution to
take this ‘matter up with
Congress for a‘ vote. The
administration response has
been that there is no time for a
political debate. This is inter-
esting since Clinton had all of
the time in the world to court
and then receive the permission
of the United Nations. A

Thirdly, there has never been
a democracy in Haiti. The man
that Clinton wants to restore to
power, Aristide, was elected
almost entirely by semi-illiter-
ate peasants and protected his
power by eliminating his politi-
cal opponents through a prac-
tice known as necklacing. This
isn’t quite the kind of democra-
cy that Jefferson had in mind.
Clinton is once again trying to
use a warped notion of democ-
racy to rally support among the
American people. The problem
is, the American people aren’t
fooled. According to one
recent poll, 73 percent of the
American people are against
any kind of invasion of Haiti.

Lastly, Clinton doesn’t want
to seek Congressional approval
because he knows that he
couldn’t get it. Even members
in his own party, such as
Joseph Biden (D-Del), have
said that according to the War
Powers Clause Clinton must
seek approval before launching
an invasion. The Democratic
Party is divided over this issue,
and Clinton does not want to
risk a political defeat by letting
Congress vote.

If the Haitian people want to
change their country there are
plenty [of them in southern
Florida to do it. The United
States could provide training,
weapons, guidance and trans-
portation. Other than that, the
solution to the so-called “Haiti
problem” is simple: the United
States should lift the economic
sanctions which are only hurt-
ing innocent Haitians and are
doing absolutely nothing to
weaken the power of the mili-
tary junta. It is also clear that
the Clinton Administration has
no clear-cut plan as to how our

military would leave Haiti.
They seem to have learned
nothing from the lessons of
Somalia. . .

There, is little doubt that if
the United States invades Haiti
we can take the island with no
difficulty at all. The problem is
that, while the Haitians will be
safe while our soldiers are
there, what happens after we
leave? Everybody knows that
the proposed so-‘called intema-
tional military force is really an
American operation, so we are
responsible for the outcome.
Somalia has recently been slip-
ping back into some of the
same chaos that was there
before the United States invad-
ed in December 1992.
Inevitably, the same type of sit-
uationwill occur-if we decide
to invade Haiti. The only true
solution to this situation is a
Haitian solution, not a democ-
racy imposed from an outside
superpower. For in reality, that

‘ would be no true democracy at

all.

Finally, there are the ramiﬁ-
cations of what happens when
a president disobeys the
Constitution. There are conse-
quences on both the interna-
tional and domestic sides. If

. Clinton is allowed to invade

other nations at will, where
will it stop? Practically all of
the nations in Africa are in
similar situations. Do we send
forces there next? The United
States cannot attempt to solve
the problems of the world
unless they have a direct effect
on U.S. national interest.

Domestically, the conse-
quences would be felt in the
ranks of a military that already
feels uncomfortable at best
with this president. It could
also potentially paralyze a
Congress that seems to be ripe
for partisan bickering as the
country heads into the 1994
mid-term and 1996 elections.
Either way one looks at it.
internationally or domestically,
an invasion of Haiti is just a
bad policy decision.

The Pitt News, Thursday, September 15, 199:1

Reader stands up for W-courses

Dear Editor,

This letter is in response to
Ted Shaffrey’s article that
appeared in the “Opinions” sec-
tion of The Pitt News on Sept.
8, 1994.

Rather than write an article
which is nothing more than a
complaint that a professor will
not give you special privileges,
why not accept the fact that you
made the mistake of registering
late for what appears to be a
rather popular class?
Unfortunately, by not being one
of the first 22 students to recog-
nize the course as something
you may actually enjoy as you
also fulfill a requirement, you
just missed out — nothing
more, nothing less. W—courses

are so called because the stu-
dents are supposedly required
to do a certain amount of writ-
ing for the class. Obviously the
instructor must then correct all
of the students’ writing assign-

    

    

ments, which is why there is a
limit on the class size and
which is also why no one
should feel pressured into giv-
ing you special permission to
get into the class. A

Your article is misleading,

letting students believe that it is
difficult to register for all W-
courses. If you really want to
give students some good
advice, why not tell them not to
follow your example by waiting
until your last semester to
decide to fulﬁll one of your W-
course requirements. Also, if
you still have such a strong
desire to follow the “Reading
Poetry” class, which seems to
have given you some good
inspiration, why not ask the
instructor if you can just sit in
while you proceed to breeze
through the other W-course for
which you have already done
most of the required reading?

Don '2‘ invade Haiti

Dear Editor,

It is a disappointment that The Pitt News has expressed
that the U.S. invasion of Haiti is the right thing to do. The
United States should help by lifting the embargo and staying
out of Haiti’s affairs.

It seems that basic urgency for the military deployment is
to set an example in the Southern Hemisphere that reasserts
American power by keeping Haiti under the sphere of
American influence and control.

The alleged grave concern with Haiti’s “democracy” is
another American political farce.

Would the United States be satisfied with a Kuwait style
government in Haiti? -

What we can expect is just more aggression, destruction
and death American style. S

Parental Advisory: this arti-
cle contains an explicit contro-
versy and vulgar material
which this newspaper staff has
determined to be unsuitable
for children. Positive proof of
identification is required in
order to read on, and those
under the age of 18 are pro-
hibited from indulging in this
information.

Simmering in Pennsylvania's
General Assembly is House
Bill 2982, which would make it
illegal for youths under the age
of 18 to purchase material
containing parental warning
labels. if passed, the bill would
impose $25 to $100 fines upon
any music outlet violating the
bill and would require 25 to
100 hours of community ser-
vice at a rape crisis center for

 9:

CD3, albums or tapes.

The bill’s sponsor T.J.
Rooney, D-Northampton, said
the bill was drafted out of a
concern that violent and sexist
messages in music contribute
significantly to acts of violence
and sexism within American
society. At Monday’s public
hearing in Harrisburg, state
lawmakers heard from both
the bill’s opponents and sup-
porters and scheduled a com-
mittee hearing for Sept. 27.

Based on testimony from
James Johnson, a professor at
the University of North

Carolina-Wilmington, Rooney
said there is a correlation
between violence found in rap
music and an acceptance of
the use of violence in society

(including violence against
women). Johnson’s survey
was completed using the fol-
lowing methodology: ‘‘In the
present study,” he wrote, “45
inner-city black males (11-16)
were exposed to violent rap
music videos, nonviolent rap
music videos or no videos
(controls).” The subjects then
read two passages which eval-
uated their positions toward
violence and academic suc-
cess. From the survey,
Johnson concluded that rap
music does increase the
acceptance’ of violence and
anti-social behavior.
Forty-five? Come on, T.J.,
there are close to 12 million
Pennsylvanians, and Johnson
only deemed it necessary to
sample, at most, one half a

milli-percent of this population.
It seems unfathomable that
Harrisburg may pass a law
which will affect millions of
people, yet only base the leg-
islation on the attitudes of 45
people. And according to
John Woods, co-founder of
Rock Against Censorship
(ROC), Johnson conducted
the survey in one single day.
However, Rooney said
Johnson’s survey was simply
one of many similar surveys,
and his results were consistent
with the conclusions of those
others. “The point is, and
Playthell Benjamin said this
most articulately, we can study
this shit until we are all blue in
the face, but in the process
people are getting killed  I
believe it to be accurate and

consistent with the others that

have been done  i mean,
you can poke holes in any-
thing,” Rooney argued. The
fact that Johnson’s methodolo-
gy, as unscientific as a ninth-
grade Civics project, does not
bother Rooney should illus-
trate the absurdity of this bill.
Granted, people are being
shot and killed on America’s
streets, but Rooney’s state-
ment reeks of pre-election
maneuvering. What happens
when our politicians politicize
crime for their own ends?

and Johnson may argue, “You

 «gag,
Hey Pittsburgh, how ya’ll
feel out there? I'm back after

a week, and guess what I got.
That’s right, more scoop! I got
the lowdown on a brother
who's ready to die. So let us
begin. Peep it.

BIG is one of the latest and
hottest acts to come out of the
Brooklyn area and without a
doubt represents his borough
well. The former hustler-
turned-rapper has started a
buzz since the first time he
was put on wax. The first time
we heard the man come off
was on the the Mary J. Blige
remix to “Real Love.” Then he
hit us off with a phat verse on
Heavy D. and the Boyz’ joint
“Bunch Of Niggas.”

After he did the joint with
Heav, he came out with his
own shit on the “Who’s The
Man” sountrack called “Party
and Bullshit.” Then came
another classic rhyme on the
Super Cat remix for “Do||y My.
Baby.” '

With all of this under his
belt, Biggie left everybody
wanting to hear his solo joint.
But just like label-mate Craig
Mack, things hit a sour note
for B.l.G. when it came to a
record company believing in
him. Just like for Mack, the
one person that would believe
in him was Sean “Puffy”
Combs.

Combs was made aware of
B.l.G. by way of The Source’s
magazine, Unsigned Hype. ‘‘I

used to hang out with the.

OGB Crew, The Old Gold
Brothers, over on Bedford
Ave.,” B.|.G. explains. That’s
where he got his start. They
weren’t a rap crew, but one of
them had turntables in his
basement, so they would go
over there and make tapes.
Tapes started to get around in
his Bed-Stuy neighborhood. ‘‘It

was fun just hearin’ myself on .

tape over beats.” With all of

the fun, B.l.G. had no real »

thoughts of getting a record
deal.

One of Biggie’s tapes was
passed to another Bed-Stuy
native, Big Daddy Kane’s DJ
Mister Cee. Cee thought the
shit was hype and passed it to
Matty C at The Source to get

into the Unsigned Hype.
Source thought it was dope, so
they asked him to appear on a
compilationalbum of their best
UnsignediHype winners. The
album never came out, but
Common Sense, BackllBack,
Mobb Deep and B.l.G. all
wound up with record deals.
Everything sort of took B.l.G.
by surprise. He never had a
thought of getting a record
deal. Yet within a couple
weeks he wasin The Source
on the compilation album and
penning a deal with Uptown
Records. Combs was the

national director of A&R at th
time; he saw a little someting
in Biggie and took him into his
family. After all his success, it
wasn’t a matter of “will it be
dope,” but of “how dope will it
be?”

“Puffy treated my album like
an R&B album. As far as pitch,
breath control, all that shit, he
was making sure my shit was
right,” according to B.l.G.

The album was finished, but
Combs left Uptown to start
Bad Boy Records. Without
Combs, Uptown dropped
B.l.G., and Bad Boy was right

   

  

 

there to pick him up. This is
what B.|.G. wanted anyway,
he insists.

Now to get to the album
titled “Ready To Die”, which is
out in stores as we speak. To
put it plain words, it’s pure
uncut DOPE. With beats done
by Easy Mo Bee, The Bluez
Brothers, The Trak Masters
and Lord Finesse and a B-side
cut done by Dj Premire, the
music is tight. Lyrically, B.l.G.
is second to no one. With
joints such as “Me and My
Bitch,” “The What” (with
Method Man) and “Respect”

it’s one of the dopest to come

Well, check it. I’m outta here.

Crappin' You Negative
The Grifters
Shangri—La

Not too long ago the term
‘Memphis cool" intimated a
southern-rock type of music
that somewhat stagnated the
progression of the Delta
Blues, filtering it down to a
commercially-viable, FM-
style format. Such bands as
Lynyrd Skynyrd and the
Black Crowes stole from and
subsequently thrived off the
innovations of classic blues-
men Muddy Waters and
Robert Johnson, building
arena-filling careers off
music popular in juke joints
and on Beale Street —— while
donating virtually nothing to
its evolution.

But in that same time
span, a more low-pub type of
music, deriving its roots from
that same influence of
Waters, Memphis Slim and
Blind Lemon, popped up and
flourished —- albeit with less
commercial success.

With a more heavy-hitting
sound, the Alex Chiltons and
Jon Spencers of the world
kept, and keep, the burning
torch of the greats, but churn
out ideas and visions with
more ingenuity than others
who were content to live on a
riff and a smokin' solo.

Memphis‘s Grifters, a band
whose blues roots are at the
core of their music but who
refuse to give in to the
generic southern rock feel
that so many others have.
are cut from that mold, pro-
ducing a new feel to a very
insphaﬁonalsound.

“Crappin’ You Negative."
the quartet's second full-
length release and eighth
overall, delivers with a
steady diet of catchy riffs.
exploding guitars and drums
and, more than anything
else, a building and then
decomposing sound that
gives the band a unique fla-
vor.

The album kicks off with

just that type of feeling: on ’

“Rats” — a song that lead
singer/guitarist (one of two)
Dave Shouse described. in
concert. as a song inspired
by the likes of Waters but
ending up sounding like
Spencer — the lyricist bel-
lows, ‘Well I swear/l never
meant to leave you tied up to
a train/That was already
restless enough,‘ before a
cavalcade of lo-fi, scratchy
guitars dumps down on his
strained lyrics. That theme is
interwoven through the
album, on such songs as
‘Maps of the Sun.“
"Piddlebach" and “Junkie

Blood.”

The riff-driven ‘Bronze
Cast’ evokes the lament of a
“Cool Jerk’ with ‘no special
slogan,‘ and ‘Get Outta that
Spaceship 8. Fight Like a
Man“ tingles with cuteness.

Stan Gallimore and Tripp
Lambrins’ rhythm section
powers an album on which
the most intriguing feature is
Shouse and Scott Taylor (the
other singer/guitarist) and
their crash-and-burn sound.

What the Grifters lack in
out-and-out power, they
make up with a grinning wry-
ness that transforms a song
from catchy to irresistible.

Taylor, for instance, pre-
cedes a writing guitar with
the claim “I am the Mambo
King/Wrapped tight in my
tarantula skin," on “Skin Man
Palace" — the album's best

song. After the song disinte-
grates with a fury of disem-
boweled catharsis, what
mortal man has enough
nerve to openly dispute him?

The band’s eight releases
and a Taylor solo project are
the only products the tiny
Shangri—La — located on
Midtown‘s ultra-hip Madison
Ave. -—— currently have. The
Grifters are planning a tour
of England and Germany in
October, and then will tour
the South in November with
the suddenly-huge Guided
By Voices.

An amalgamation of the
classic blues sensibility and
an innovative free spirit.
“Crappin’ You Negative"
seems to be the perfect
combo for those who admire
Chilton instead of Chris
Robinson.

appropriate ethically and
extremely timely. Ska is final-
ly beginning to reach a level
of popularity in America,
thanks to the success of
metal icons the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones and Moon
Records founders. the
Toasters.

Ska: like reggae.
faster... and with HORNS!

For more historical infor-
mation, listen to the
Skatalites and early (1963-
64) Bob Marley and Jimmy
Cliff. Then you'll see where it
started. For now, the above
definition will do just fine.

The music on
Skarmageddon ranges from
great (Boston's Allstonian's)
to poor (Boston's Thumper)
and from brilliant New School
(VA's Pitasters) to Hellhole
of the '90s (D.C.’s Skunks).
Bands like Skinnerbox have
been doing this since the

but

 

mid-'80s, and it shows. They,
the Pietasters and the
ancient Allstonians are some
of the bands that the
Slackers and such went to
see when they were growing
up. They know their history,
rooted in the late-'70s ska
revival in England, headed
by Madness and the Specials
and called Two-Tone. On the
other hand, a group like The
Pacers, from Wisconsin,
prefers to strive for “inven-
tiveness” and “originality”
and to end up with Green
Day-esque music with a Ska
shroud. is it better to create
a “new” that is drab and
inanimate than to hold onto a
bit of an “old” that is strong
and uplifting?

The great triumph of
Skarmageddon is the unveil-
ing to the national eyes of
the sweet soul music of San
Francisco's Durango 95.

Playing northern soul, a
breed of Tamla (as Motown
was called in England) music
known for its fast, head-
shaking 1-2 beats and super-
production, as opposed to
‘ska’ per se. Durango 95's
‘Don't Give it Up” brings the
listener out of his seat the
moment the first play is
pressed. With an 11-piece
lineup, including three
singers, horns and a violin,
Durango play mod music like
no one since  well, I guess
since the late 60's. I will
avoid comparisons to early
Dexy’s Midnight Runners in
order not to confuse the
readers with memories of
overalls and ‘Come On
Eileen." so we'll just bring up
the Marvelettes and maybe
some Ray Charles. With a 7"
single out and an album on
the way, keep your ears and
feet peeled for this band,
though exposure will be mini-
mal. That's how talent oper-
ates — quietly, seven songs
in on a compilation.

Other moments of note
include the AIlstonian's
Sinatra booze-up Ska of
“Spike” and D.C.’s
Checkered Cabs Two-Tone-
ish “Live Happily." All in all,
however, Bucket, Moon
Records commander-in-chief
and leader of the Toasters,
knows more than enough
about good music to put all
this metal on an allegedly
pork-pie hatted record. It's a
good introduction to what's
happening today. but if this
platter was my first intro to
Ska music, I certainly
wouldn't get a shiver at the
sight of a Hammond Organ
or a Vespa scooter. l guess
I'm a cynic. Oh well. Suits —
Not Boots.

Crank
Hoodoo Gurus
Arista

The Hoodoo Gurus took a
two-year hiatus and strayed
from their previous formula
of self—production by turn-
ing the duties over to Ed
Stasium (Living Colour,
Smithereens.) The changes
were a conscious effort to
capture the spirit of their live
shows and funnel as much
energy into this record. To
be different! The result
being, of course, their sixth
album sounding exactly like
the previous five.

Don't get me wrong, I liked
Crank, it's just not the revo-
lutionary. breakthrough, be-
all-to-end-all record the
press release would have
you believe. Unlike some of
the other pseudo-intellectual
Aussie bands, (now comes
the Part when I compare this
QVOUD to other bands sharing
a similar sound, look, mem-

bers or geographical region)
like Crowded House or
Midnight Oil, the Hoodoo
Gurus offer 13 light, fun
pop/rock songs without ask-
ing for a lot of commitment in
the lyric department.

Midnight Oil, acting as the
self-appointed watchdogs for
pollution and land rights, go
after the listeners political
self-awareness, (or lack
thereof.) Crowded House
jumps in with the sensitivity
vote, falling back on songs
about lost love and doomed
relationships. The Hoodoo
Gurus instead opt for the
more traditional sounds of
Australia, stepping forward to
pick up the torch of mindless
rock. dropp d years ago by
Men At Wo .

The deepest song lyrically
on the album deals with tele-
vangelists. (‘Gospel Train”) a

territory forged in the late— '

'80s and since trampled on

by every U2-esque band to '

come along. With lyrics like.
‘I was in rock and roll long
ago, the hours too long and
the pay too low.” you get the
idea that the band's two-year
break wasn't spent locked in
a room with pen and paper.

However, there are a few
honorable mentions. The
album opens with ‘Right
Time.” a song from Dave
Faulkner's (lead singer and
founding member) unfinished
homage to the rock operas of
the 1970's. The song is sup-
posed to be play when the
female bike gang and ‘David
Koresh—like guru" come to
terrorize the town. (I swear
I'm not making this stuff up.)

Also needing a mention is
‘Open My Eyes." A tribute to
the puppy-love pop song
genre featuring vocals from
ex——Bangles guitarist Vicki
Peterson. (the band saves
itself by admitting this is sup-
posed to be an “embarrass-
ing bubblegum pop song” in
the same vein as the
Partridge Family.)

So it's not the equivalent of
the Beatle’s ‘White Album,”
nor will it knock the ‘Forrest
Gump” soundtrack off the
charts. So what. If you liked
the earlier Hoodoo Gurus.
you'll appreciate this album;
if you didn't like them. don't
bother. Regardless, the
world will continue to spin
until we one day hurl into the
sun and all burst into flames.

Pony Express Record
Shudder To Think
A.B.

Prepare to embark on an
adventurous musical journey!
Sounds inviting, doesn't it?
Well, it is. Straight out of
D.C.. after being with
Dischord Records. Shutter
to Think signed with Epic and
formed the Pony Express

Album that takes listeners to
a place where music has not
gone before.

Old fans have been to this
world. They should prepare
to meet a slightly different
sound. but not a dissappoint-
ing noise. New adventurers
should open up and fall in
love.

Shudder to Think opens
the album with ‘Hit Liquor’
(formerly an 7"), which cre-
ates an unmatched sound of
incoherent parts that piece
together, forming an all-
around satisfation within the
ears. It moves into a driving
tune, enhanced by distinctive
basslines and Craig
Wedren's luring and unpredi-

cable voice.

The album falls into a sort
of pattern which is suddenly
broken by the second half.
‘X-French T-shirt’ calms and
softens the sound with a
catchy chant ‘Hold back the
road that goes so that the
others will do what you let
me in just to pour me down
their mouths.’ Confused?
Shudder To Think will never
spell out a black and white
meaning to their songs. they
leave it open-ended. to let us
think what we want. Can you
imagine the insanity of it all?

An acoustic and potentially
groovy ‘Happy Birthday.
Baby” fades into the eighth
song, ‘No Rm. 9 Kentucky" a

beautiful, relaxing song with
haunting lyrics: ‘3 a.m. the
pill bottle top will have come
undone.‘ The listener is
actually told a story in this
tune. but left with questions
of who and why; again a
mystery remains.

Wedren's entrancing voice
is continually amazing
throughout the album, espe-
cially in ‘Own Me" and ‘So
Into You.‘ His range is
impressive and unmatched
In ‘Own Me.” The music fol-
lows the lyrics so closely it
creates a sound to which
anyone can follow.

if the pure art of Shutter to
Think's music doesn't
impress you, the talent of the

members will. Becoming
consumed in an eerie musi-
cal dreamland is simple
when singer/guitarist Craig
Wedren lulls listeners. Stuart
Hlll's basslines develop with
Adam Wade's (formerly of
Jawbox) pushing and pound-
ing rythyms.

So. if you're interested in
something new. or you know
them better from the old.
pick-up Pony Express

adventurous, take a trip to
good ol' West Virginia next

deep black symmetrical
designs to hypnotic, fazed
out flowers.

Urbanek is a realist when
he said. ‘You gotta do what
you gotta do to please a
Customer.”

Urbanek has been profes-
sionally giving tattoos for 4
years. Some of his work has
been featured in such publi-
cations as Tattoo and
Out/aw Biker and Tattoo. He
has had no formal art train-
ing and attributes his talent
to his grandfather, who was
an artist.

With his unique tatent and
new philosophy of clean,
safe and happy tattooing,
Urbanek said that he
plans to put Pittsburgh
on the map of the tattoo
world.

A breakdown of his philos-
ophy shows how he plans
to demystify the tattoo
as being a form of self muti-
lation. Urbanek wants to
bring tattoos into the main-
stream, proving that they
are not just for sailors and
bikers.

Clean, Clean, Clean. The
first thing one notices when
visiting Inka Dinka D00 is
that the place is beyond
“spic and span." Mr. Clean
would be jealous if he ever
saw this place. Stark white
walls are offset with black
furniture and samples of
Urbanek‘s work.

Safety is in the cleanliness
of the studio. The clean
walls and woodwork are
nice. but the heart of
Urbanek‘s philosophy lies
in the safety of his tattoos.

He employs the use of V

an autoclave to medically
sterilize all of his instrumen-
tation. This is the
same equipment hospitals
use to sterilize their medical
instrumentation. Autoclaves
are the only pieces
of machinery that can totally
sterilize an object. Urbanek
cuts no corners by using
a new needle for every
customer. For added safety,
he sports a fresh pair of
rubber gloves while he
works.

Happiness is radiated
throughout the studio like
an atom bomb. Gieger coun-
ters could be going off
the scales here. The ceiling,
painted with seemingly
drunk potted flowers sticking
their tongues out at
you, makes you spill a
grin onto your face. Urbanek
cracks jokes with his buddy
Girone as The Melvins
hammer out a crunching
tune over the stereo sys-
tem. Everybody is up-
beat and relaxed in this stu-
dio.

Urbanek is quite serious
about his profession. He
said, ‘Too many people are
in this business for fast
money and to pick up
chicks." He is in this busi-

studio. They range from

ness to stay, and said that,
he will always be involved in
tattooing one way or the
other.

There is an unseen,
less glamorous side to
being a tattoo artist. After
shooting ink for 8 or 9
hours, there is a lot of
prep work involved, said
Urbanek.

“You have to make your
needles and continuously
tune your equipment.”
Urbanek and Girone are also
the cleanup crew at Inka
Dinka Doo, making
sure everything is always in

order.

An hour after he began,
Urbanek put the finishing
touches on the woman's
shoulder. Gwen Gaudioso
seemed surprised when
Urbanek said he was fin-
ished with her black, tribal
crest tattoo. ‘I really like it.”
said the smiling Gaudioso
as she peered into the
mirror. Shiny and wet, the
tender tattoo was covered
with a bandage. Gaudioso
had just become the latest
person to experience
Urbanek‘s new concept in
tattooing.

my feelings
on the end to
the 1994 MLB
season would
have been best
represented by the tearstains I
could have left in this space on
each and every copy of this
issue.

Interim Commissioner Bud
Selig’s decision to cancel the
rest of the season yesterday
ends an 89-year run for the
World Series.

And so as the tarnished
image of baseball. wrought
from the salary cap battle
between the owners and play-
ers’ union. continues to rust.
not even the sport's showcase
will be around to try and regain
the fans‘ trust.

I was nine when the
Milwaukee Brewers met the St.
Louis Cardinals in the 1982
World Series. It was the first
time I remember watching an
entire series. It was beautiful.
Ozzie Smith, Moose Haas, Pete
Vuckovich. Keith Hernandez,
Robin Yount, Paul Molitor 
oh, man they were all beautiful.
I fell in love with baseball in
Oct.. 1982.

Now if my writing reads
corny. like some heartbroken
sap. it's because it is and I am.

My 12-year relationship with
the game 1 love is huning, and
I don't know what to do. I feel
I'm being bombarded with lit-
tle signs that are pointing to the
end.

Anxious to capitalize on a
new league. some agent named
Dick Moss comes around and
says:

“I don't think you'll ever see
baseball the same again. and I
doubt if you'll ever see base-
ball in Milwaukee again."

And I hate him for it.

I hate him. because I know
that what he's saying might not
be wrong. what he's saying
might be closer to the truth
than you or I know.

In a recent Sports Illustrated.
a headline actually referred to
the National Football League
as our National Pastime.

I know they were trying to be
cute, well at least I think  I
hope they were.

Intensity can be a valuable
asset to a team. Lack of it can
be a very terrible hindrance.

One needs only to remem-
ber the eyes of former
Chicago Bears linebacker
Mike Singletary. The intensi-
ty was so incredible that
he saw only the opponent.
heard only the quarterback
and thought only about
the other team and what
he was going to do to them.
Well, needless to say, none
of that intensity was present
last night with the Pitt soc-
cer team at Pitt Stadium.

The Panthers’ prime time
debut versus Forbes Avenue
neighbor Carnegie Mellon
University was a successful
one but was half-hearted at
best. The Panthers defeated
the Tartans 3-2 on the soggy
turf to take their record to 3-
0.

The game-winning goal
was scored by sophomore for-
ward Knut Saeter with 35
minutes left in the second
half. The shot went to the left
side of CMU goaltender Dan
Warren and into the back of
the net.

“Knut played well." head
coach Joe Luxbacher said. “It
was a great goal for him.”

Pitt may have won the
game. but the Panther bench
was not a happy one after the
final horn sounded.

“We didn't play very well."

Last season two of Pitt's
three wins were upsets aired

Southern Mississippi and
Rutgers both were victimized
by the Panthers prime time
heroics.

The Panthers will try to add
Ohio State to the list
Saturday afternoon as they
travel to Ohio Stadium to
face the 23rd-ranked
Buckeyes on ESPN.

Pitt will be facing an Ohio
opponent for the second
straight week. Last Saturday.
the Panthers defeated Ohio
University 30-16 for their
first win of the season.

Sophomore tailback Billy
West stepped in for an
injured Curtis Martin and
rushed for 226 yards en route
to being named the Big East
Player of the Week.

The Panthers may look to
West again Saturday as
Martin is listed as question-
able with an ankle injury.

“Billy West is a very good
football player," head coach
John Majors said. “He is very

The shot found the upper
right corner of the goal with
7:11 left in the first half.

“Todd broke the ice. It was
a good goal for him."
Luxbacher said.

"We won the game. and that
is all that counts." Graf said.
“The intensity was not
there. We need to go after it
more."

Just a minute and a half
later. Pitt junior midfielder
Jeff Porter. starting his first
game of the season. scored.
lifting the Panthers to a 2-0
lead at halftime.

Pitt started off the second
half not looking much more
awake than in the first
half. Saeter scored the even-
tual game-winner. on
an assist from freshman Jason
Piombino. and gave the
Panthers a 3-0 lead that
they would struggle to hold
on to.

From that point on. CMU
turned up the own intensity
level and put the pressure on
the Panthers’ defense and
starting goalkeeper Kirk
Brodows.

The Tartans' first goal was
scored by freshman Jason
Buelow with 28 minutes left
in the game. The goal was a
header. on a free kick. from in
front of the goal that got past
a leaping Brodows.

“[The first goal] brought us
back a little." Buelow said.

Lightning struck twice as
Buelow registered his second
goal of the game with 13:26
remaining in the contest.
It came on a corner kick as
he blasted by the Panther
goalie.

below average last year,"
Majors said. “We are not a
dominating offensive line.
They have executed very
well the first two weeks and
are playing up to their poten-
tial."

The line play has clearly

been a strong point as Pitt
had back-to-back 200-yard
rushers for the first time
since 1976. Last week. the
Panthers racked up 312 yards
against Ohio without the ser-

center Lawson Mollica said.
“I think that we have guys
who execute a lot better this
year"

“A lot of it has to do with a
harder work ethic. We want
to be good. There is a great
tradition of offensive linemen
here at Pitt. We're trying to
bring that level of excellence
back up to what it once was."

The line will be trying to
protect fonner juco quarter-
back Sean Fitzgerald who
will be playing in front of the
largest crowd of his career.
The Buckeyes will be expect-

“Styles can play with the

He's one of the best in the
country."

As a freshman. Mary
Allison Williams could never
have imagined what her status
as an athlete would be like in
four years. On Nov. l4.
Williams will find out.

Williams. who is an assis-
tant track and field coach at
the University of Pittsburgh.
has been named the 1994
Pennsylvania NCAA Woman
of the Year. With this presti-
gious honor, Williams
becomes one of 51 finalists for
the title of NCAA Woman of
the Year Award.

“[Winning the Pennsylvania
award] is pretty good."
Williams said. “I'd like to win
the whole thing.”

Steve Lewis. Pitt's head
track and field coach, said the
recognition Williams is receiv-
ing is overdue.

“A few more people are
becoming aware of Mary
Allison Williams as a person
and as an athlete," Lewis said.
"I think it is a great indicator
of the type of student athlete
she's been over her college
career."

Williams is of no surprise to
Lewis.

“Allison was an athlete that
basically defied all of the
rules." Lewis said. “Not only
just being good. but as being
one of the best as far as the
rules are concemed."

“It feels good to be recog-
nized for what you do other
than being recognized locally
as far as the university."
Williams said. “It is a definite
plus when somebody besides
your own family recognizes
you."

In the beginning of her
career. Williams was made
aware of her potential by
coaches. She was given a path
to follow, and, looking back
now. she greatly appreciates it.

“When you are a freshman.
you blow things off."
Williams said. “As a freshman
and a sophomore. people like
my coach and athletic admin-

istrators stressed how impor-
tant it was to maintain grades
and athletics and a personal
slash social life to make
myself a well-rounded indi-

 

TRACK
AND
FIELD

vidual."

Predicting her future is
something Williams will not
even try. The thought
occurred to Lewis. Even
though he does not know

much about her competitors.
she would be the perfect rep-
resentative of that award. ‘

"Allison is a perfect exam-
ple of what the award repre-
sents." Lewis said.

Describing attributes that
helped Williams achieve her
honors is something that
comes easy for Lewis.

"It was a matter of talent
incorporated with a desire to
be the best she can be." Lewis
said.

Doing her best is what
Williams has always tried to
do. and it is something she
continues to strive for as a
coach.

For this reason. being nomi-
nated for the award was unex-
pected.

“No one ever said. ‘You
could be the NCAA Woman of
the Year.‘ As a matter of fact. I
never heard of it until some-
one sent me a letter saying.
‘You won for Pa.."’ Williams
said. “I said. ‘Oh. o.k.. that's
nice."'

Williams‘ humility and
gratefulness show when she
speaks of the advice she was
given by her coaches.

"First. what everyone was
telling me when l was a fresh-
man was true. which of course
you don't believe as a fresh-
man." Williams said. "Second
of all. I am glad I have taken
their advice."

Now it is Williams‘ turn to
give the advice. The transition
from an athlete to a coach has
been an easy move for
Williams.

‘‘I’m enjoying it because l'm
giving back to my team and to
my coach." Williams said.

“It helps that l was a recent
athlete. because I know all of
the athletes personally because
they were my teammates just a
year ago. That makes the tran-
sition easier."

On September l8. ten final-
ists will be announced in San
Diego. It will be one of the
most important hurdles in
Williams’ career.

Pitt faces new OSU team after offseason problems

Ga//away
gone, 72
players
lost to NFL

By Keith Pompey
Senior S140’ Writer

To say the Panthers were
overrnatched the last time Pitt
faced Ohio State is an under-
statement.

/’1\\

The Panthers
(1-1) got
whipped by
the Buckeyes
(1-1) 63-28
last year.

But accord-
ing Ohio State's head coach
John Cooper, this weekend's
contest will be a lot closer.

“I think Johnny [Majors] has

done a great job with the Pitt
football team. I think they are
a much. much. much improved
football team than the team we
played a year ago. They are
well-coached. They got a lot of
returning players coming back
on last year's football team.
They have a good scheme.
They know what they are
doing. They are playing with a
lot more confidence than a
year ago.

“We got a lot of work that
needs to be done. I think it is
going to be an excellent ball
game this week."

Based on Ohio State's off-
season problems, plus the fact
that 12 members of last year's
team are now playing in the
NFL, Ohio State has fallen
from the great team they were
a year ago.

I am about as discouraged as
I’ve been in quite a long time
with our football team,"
Cooper said. “We got a lot of
work to be done this week
before we play Pitt."

 

The Buckeyes problems
started back in April as their
image began to tarnish. On the
21st of that month, Rickey
Dudley. a backup tight end.
was charged with driving
while intoxicated. This past
Tuesday, an arrest warrant was
issued for the 6-feet-7-inch,
240-pound junior for not pay.-
ing $369 in fines and court
cost related to the case.

To make matters worse, on
June 2. nose guard Timiko
Payton and offensive tackle
Eric Moss were arrested for
stealing an automatic teller
card.

Also on July 27, place-kick-
er Mike Malfatt was charged
with shoplifting. It was report-
ed that the freshman stole
$445 worth of stuff from a dis-
count store.

But the Buckeyes’ biggest
off-the-field problem came on
Sept. 7. On that day, Heisman
Trophy candidate and star
receiver Joey Galloway was
suspended for two games for

accepting $200 from a ﬁnan-
cial advisor last year.

Galloway's absence was evi-
dent last week as Ohio State
was badly outplayed by the
19th-ranked University of
Washington. The final score of
25-16 wasn't a fair estimation
of the game. The Buckeyes
were clearly overmatched.
Without Galloway, the Huskies
stopped the run and forced
Ohio State's quarterback
Bobby Hoying to throw the
ball 38 times.

“I think we had some play-
ers last week who sort of took
the attitude ‘we don't have
Galloway so we can't do this
and we can't do that,"‘ Cooper
said. “We can't throw the ball.
We don't have anybody who is
going to make big plays for us.
They were looking for reasons
not to play well and they found
them.

“We miss Galloway. There's
no question about that. If you
take your home run hitter out
of your lineup, you are going

to miss him. There is no ques-
tion Joey is our big—play guy."

Galloway is not the only
offensive player who will be
missed from last year's team.
The Buckeyes lost running
backs Butler By‘note. Jeft
Cothran and Raymond Harris
to the draft.

Since their departure, the
coaching staff has not found a
worthy replacement.

“Eddie George, a big run-
ning back, got some stats, but
he has to play better than he
has played in the first two
games," Cooper said. “He
hasn't hit any home runs for
us. He has to do a better job of
holding on to the football. He
fumbled a couple of times in
[last week's] ball game."

Cooper also admitted Pitt's
running backs might have
something to do with the out-
come of Saturday's game.

“We better stop those
backs," he said. “We better
stop bath of them or else we
are going to be in for a long
afternoon.

“I don't know if we played
anybody who had two individ-
ual running backs gain 200 in
the first two ballgames like
Curtis Martin and Billy West."

But Cooper doesn't believe
his defense will have to make
many changes this weekend.
Ohio State will try to platoon
around the ball when Martin or
West touches it.
