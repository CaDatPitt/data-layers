Pitt Copies Other Universities,   wntes Down Laws For Publishing 

By JEFF COUCH

Pitt News Staff Writer

‘C3 A University copyright policy,

  Resident Sitrdents Blast Cafeteria

designed to conform with stan-

dards speciﬁed in a 1978 federal’

copyright law, is currently being
drafted by University officials.

The law grants an employer - like
Pitt,’ _- the legal right to own the
copyright on any written works
produced by an employee, accord-
ing to William Nasri, copyright
resource and special counsel to the
University Patent and Copyright
Committee.

Federal agencies and sponsoring
corporations have begun to “claim
ownership or control distribution of

royalties” in cases where a
University does not have a
copyright policy of its own.’
Because of this practice, adminis-
tration ofﬁcials "believed it was
necessary to adopt a policy for Pitt,
Nasri said. 1

“As a matter of principle, the
University does not claim owner-
ship of any copyright to which a
member .of the Pitt community is
entitled to while working in a
University environment and using
minimal services.”

“Occasionally, the University
may make a contribution through
the extensive use of equipment
(and other Pitt-owned resources),”

Nasri said.

In cases where the University
has a sizeable investment, Pitt may
claim some rights to the work,
Nastri added. A

The A University Patent and
Copyright Committee will deter-_

copyright, in this case, would be
owned by the author who created
‘the work. The author would be
entitled to all financial rewards
obtained through publication.

The second category deals with
works that ‘involve “individual

mine the amount of ~University'! initiative and considerable use of

input into a project through a set of
criteria] outlined in the third draft
of the copyright policy. Each
written work will be classified into
one of three categories, according
to Nasri. _ ~

The ﬁrst category,“-Nasri said,
involves -“works evolved under
individual initiative with minimal
use of facilities and services.” The

Resident’ students appeared in
force with a petition bearing 1200
names at last night’s Student
Government Board. meeting in

protest of the cafeteria food they.

termed "highly unsuitable and
unsanitary’ ’ . i

The students, who began last
week gathering signatures at a
table «set up in» the main Towers
lobby cited speciﬁc instances of im-
proprieties in the cafeteria food and
management:

—The food served is often cold
or uncooked, e..g. raw chicken and
roast beef.

—Much of the food served is
starchy, fatty food high in
carbohydrates and .cholesterol.
The type of food served poses a
health problem to students.

—The management fails to vary
the menus, serving the same food
each week. *

—The glassware in the cafeteria’

is often distributed to students with

C ragged, broken edges, once again

posing a danger to students.
—Pieces of bone and other
fragments are often found in the
meat, in particular the veal.
——Sour milk being dispensed
from the machines. .
The board unanimously voted to

‘endorse the work of the students

and moved to assist them with their
presentation to the proper mem-
bers of the administration.

“The cafeteria management

should have more consideration for
the students who live in the dorms
and eat in the cafeteria,”
McDermott, spokesman for the
group said.

to use other students’ meal tickets
when the meal tickets are not being

“I was once told that the reason

someone to use their roommate

person would eat every meal they "

bought they wouldn’t have enough

food to give all of the students,’_’ -

Watterson said.
“The people that are here

tonight have a legitimate com-

plaint —obviously people are dissat-
iﬁed,” Watters_on said. “They
have complaint cards posted at the
exit of the cafeteria where people
have constantly complained about
the quality of the food, but it seems
as though it has become sort of a
joke.” ' ‘

Gagliardi said six students came

substantial amount of money for
reasons they -were uncertain of.

Gagliardi said students must

Advertising with mail ﬂyers,
posters and magazine ads plays a
signiﬁcant role in enticing students
to a university, administrators all
over the country say.

The University of Pittsburgh,
and its different schools, advertise
in one way or another to show to
prospective students what they
have to offer academically.

One particular branch of Pitt, the
External Studies Program, which
offers College of Arts and Sciences’
courses to those who cannot enroll
on a full-time basis, relies heavily
on its advertising campaign to
bring in students.

In order to draw people the
program advertises such publica-
tions as the Pittsburgh Press and
TV Guide, as well as mail ﬂyers
and posters. The ads present to
prospective students, whose aver-
age age is 33, what the program
offers in university studies. ‘

“We have to rely on more mass
approaches,” said Samuel D.

9 Deep, director of External Studies.

“Pitt knows where the 17- and 18-
year-olds are and can go and speak
to them. We don’t know where all
the 33-year-olds are who want to
take advantage of this program, so
we have to do it in a more mass
advertising way.”

Costs for advertising run from
$400 for an ad in this week’s TV

Guide, to a “Fairly reasonable",

$800 for a recent full-page ad in
Time magazine. The latter did not
prove to be cost effective in terms
of enticing students to external
studies, Deep said.

Cost effect ratios are important
in that the less it costs to appeal to
future students and the more
effective an ad is in bringing them
to the university, the more
desirable the means.

External Studies makes use of
these ratios by
campaign after each term to see
what brings in quality students.

Deep says Pitt is “one of the
least expensive, and most cost
effective (universities) in the
country.” Some schools may pay

Civil Service Jobs Are A vailable for Competitive Students -

By KIMBERLY GORDISH
Pitt News Staff Writer’

“No matter what your major,
there is a job in the federal
government for you,” said George
Horn, a personnel staffing special-
ist for the U.S. Civil Service.
Commission.

Horn spoke yesterday morning in
the Student Union as part of a
week-long series of seminars
sponsored by the placement office.

According to Horn, the U.S.
government now employs two
million people, 150,000 of whom
were hired last year.

Horn outlined the necessary

steps in securing a federal

_. government job.

The applicant must go to the Job
Information Center, located down-
town in the Federal Building,
where an interview will be
conducted. The interviewer will
ask what position the applicant is
applying for, what salary the
applicant expects, and if a
relocation is possible.

“The biggest problem with
getting a federal government job is
in restricting yourself geographi-
cally,” Horn said. A

Since the Civil Service is based
on a merit system, a majority of

applicants must obtain _a competi-
tive appointment, accomplished by
taking a-Civil Service Pace test.
The exam measures aptitude and
ability to reason. The exemptions
from the e.xam include those who
ar_e veterans or handicapped
people, who receive jobs through
accepted-appointment.

If the results of the test are good
(80 percent or above), the
applicant’s name is then placed on
an ‘.‘eligibles list,”. which is
accessible to the various agencies.
The applicant then: contacts the
agency he is interested in. A rating

procedure follows. It attempts to‘

match the elements needed for the
job with the applicant’s qualfica-
tions.
with the agency follows.

Horn said some areas are more
competitive than others. Biological
sciences and education represent
keenly competitive fields, while
engineers and computer scientists
are in great deamnd and face less
competition.

According to Horn, civil service
jobs in the past were easier to

acquire. “If you want a job with
the federal government, you will
have to pursue it actively.” Horn

Many.times, an interview‘

said of the present civil service job
outlook. ._

“This contract will be based on the

No Judgement
Yet On Brinkley

Since the arrest of Sidney Brinkley on charges of
raping and killing of two Philadelphia women, a host
of other charges have been made against the man.
Pittsburgh City Police consider him a suspect in the
rape and strangulation of Monica Renee Jones in the
b_asement of Tower A, and a Tower B resident has
filed a complaint with the police claiming Brinkley
raped her in her dormitory room last Dec. 17. I

With the publication of reports of crimes allegedly
committed by Brinkley occurring almost daily, it is

important that no one makes dangerous assumptions

about the guilt of Brinkley. Instead, we must remind
ourselves constantly that Brinkley has been arraigned
only on charges in the two Philadelphia killings,
while arrest warrants have been issued-for the two
crimes of which he is accused in Pittsburgh. He has
not even been arraigned in court on the two Pitts-
burgh charges. A ’
Already, local television and press coverage have
made serious oversights in their reports on charges
against Brinkley, calling him at one point the “ac-
cused killer” of Jones. Such statements, which sug-
gest too strongly he is the killer, make the exact

‘against Brinkley. - _
There are many questions that must be answered

before acourt judges Brinkley. H First, the fact

Brinkley lived in Tower B with his girlfriend,‘ Estelle .
Hill, proves nothing, and more evidence must be"

presented in court before anyone can argue convin-

cingly that Brinkley is guilty of killing Jones; so far, '
the public evidence against Brinkley in the Jones case ‘ l

is non-existant. The charge of race against Brinklev
is weak at this point. The Pitt coed’s filing a com-
plaint after more than eight months may'hurt the

credibility of her charge, and a strong case against - b I

Brinkley in this case may be hard to develop. _
The charges’ against Brinkley and the evidence

fully, but that news must be handled with restraint by
people who constantly remind themselves that

Brinkley may be innocent. Sensational reports about ,
the charges against Brinkley serve neither the public I"

nor Brinkley.

Wagner’s Views on ‘Greeks’, Deplorable,S1anderous

Mr. Wagner’s recent comments
in the September 21 issue are
indeed deplorable, for they show
not only a high‘ degree of
ignorance, but ‘contain nothing
more than unsubstantiated slan-
der.‘ Contrary to Wagner’s views,
the fraternity is an integral part of
the college experience_._ This is
conceded even by the University’s
study of the University of Pitts-
burgh for the 1980s.

“College education” is a multi-
faceted experience. Growth occurs
in various areas, from social to
academic to civic areas. And the
fraternity is clearly a leader in_ all of
these areas. In the academic realm,
fraternities are consistently in the
lead. One fraternity even spon-
sored academic symposiums on
such issues as the oil industry and
the change in commercial banking.

Clearly no group more than the
Greeks have shown higher civic
concern. Last year, the Greek
community raised more than tlfiry
thousand dollars for the American
Cancer Society. In the light, cries of
“exploitation” do indeed seem
hollow.

Social growth is yet another
hallmark of the fraternity system.
A mark of maturity is learning to
live with one’s fellow man, and
here again the fraternity is the
ideal place to do so. And the
fraternity does it with a high
degree of excellence. This is
evidenced by the fact that a very
large percentage of this society’s
leaders are fraternity men. A

Basically, we could like the facts
to speak for themselves. And the
fact isbthat the fraternity is not only
an integral facet of the university
experience, it is -one of the most

needed, for it develops the’

leadership that is sorely needed.
- Perhaps Mr. Wagnermight want to '

consider that _it is much easier to

tear down_ than build. _Such'

negative remarksigon his‘ part are
entirely unjustified. 4

Exploitation

I am writing in _response to a
letter in your Sept.-21 issue by
Robert A. Wagner, member,
Anti-Imperialist A Student Union. I
ﬁnd it hard to sympathize with Mr.
Wagner’s complaints which state
“For their leisure, these frats get
into treating human beings as
objects and playtoys. For entertain-
ment, they exploit women.” I

believe it is unfair to generalize .

fraternities in this manner because
there are at least twenty-two
fraternities represented on the Pitt
campus and ..only two were
mentioned to be advertising exotic
evenings. In fact, I don’t believe
fraternities in general contain the
only heterosexual men whom may

find pornography as a _temporary

break from their studies. _

_W.;.I am also going to criticize Mr.
Wagner’s beleif that it is only men
whom ﬁnd satisfaction in “the
degradation and exploitation of...
sexuality in general.” Last year,
whil visiting friends’ in their
dormitory room, I realized some of
them were finding entertainment in
a pornagraphic magazine while
some of my jokes had failed to raise
laughter. Although I- may shock

,Mr. Wagner, these friendswere of

the female gender and‘ were
reading an issue of “Playgirl.”

To renourish my tasteless, male
ego and regain their attention I
offered to pose for these ‘preoc-
cupied women to compete with
their “degrading” magazine. Be-
sides, I ﬁgured the common man
needed representation also. To my

surprise they insisted I do pose-.N

What a shock! How disgusting!
Well, I did not want to take
advantage of their innocenceso I
declined. I didn’t think they had
any film" in the camera anyway.
Now, I am .sure' Mr. Wagner
meant well, however, let’s not

-generalize only fraternities, or only
heterosexual men, and especially

I not the entire student body which

he accuses fof “doing speed for
three days in a row to cram fora
test.” Not everyone has. I never
have.

Your coverage of the events

_ leading up to the murder of Monica

Jones in Towers A did not seem
appropriate for a newspaper. In
every newsworthy event, whether
it be a ﬁre, a murder or some other
tragedy, tliere ‘ are dozens of
extenuating circumstances, both
gret and small, past and present,

any one of which, had it not come _

about, may (speculatively and in
hindsight) have prevented tragedy.

I can understand shedding light
on an horrendous murder on a
college campus, especially since it
is so rare, to illuminate ‘the defects

in the security system. But in this

‘case it was dragged out too far by.

Altemating Tailbacks Part of Shell's Game     A

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

Bulletin: Freshman quarterback
Dan Marino suffered a hand injury
during practice yesterday. Al-
though x-rays were taken, the
status of the injury was unknown at

 press time.

lb.

The 1-1 Pitt Panthers invade
Philadelphia and Veterans’ sta-
dium for a game with the 3-0

Temple Owls Saturday night at ,

7:30.

After last Saturday's disap-

pointing loss to North Carolina,'.

Coach Jackie Sherrill is conﬁdent
his players are capable of re-
bounding for the rest of the season.

_‘ ‘That’s behind us,” Sherrill said
yesterday. ' “We’re looking
straight ahead right now.”

The Panthers should be in better
shape at the skilled positions
Saturday. Receivers Cliff Moore
and Keith Williams, plus freshman
Julius Dawkins, are all near 100
percent, and they should all see
action against Temple. Also,
freshman ﬂanker John Brown, who
runs a 9.7 100,_ has been impressive
during practice, and should play.

. Sherrill also announced that he’ll
take extensive looks at his three
tailbacks, Fred Jacobs, Artell
Hawkins and Rooster Jones. A

“They (the tailbacks) ran ex-
tremely well in the scrimmage
(Monday),” Sherrill explained.
“We’ll run a new tailback on each
possesion of the first half.” The
player who has the most favorable

results will play most of the second
half.

Rick Trocano will start at
quarterback, and Dan Marino will
be inserted when Sherrill feels it’sj
necessary,vwhich is usually late in
the second quarter with the ball in.
the opponent's territory and Pitt in
an obvious passing situation. 3

At Temple, Pitt will be facing an
undefeated team which has a crafty

' bord. ’ ’

old coach in Wayne Hardin.
Owls have victories over West
Virginia, Drake and Delaware, and
will be facing their biggest test
when the Pantherstake the field.

The Owls have scored 112 points
thus far, and they use an offense
Hardin likes to call a “smorgas-
They run out of -the
I-Formation = and like to utilize
several versions of the trap play-,
according to Sherrill.

‘Brian Broomell is Temple’s

quarterback,-and‘-he.’ s starting for we got by them

the third‘ consecutive year.‘ I
Broomell has been doing an
outstanding job,” said Hardin.
“and we’ve been getting good
performance from our fullback,
Mark Bright._” ’
Like Pitt, Temple likes to ‘shuffle

- its tailbacks, and will use up to four

in any game. Ron Walker ((Jr. 6’O,
218) and Sherman Myers (So. 6’O,
180) see most of the duty at the
tailback slot. ‘ V

The high-scoring Temple offense
could provide the Pitt defense with
some problems, especially because
injuries are starting to hit Athe
Panthers. Defensive tackle Jim
Co-vert will undergo shoulder
surgery in the near future and will
be lost for the season. He will be
redshirted, and have ‘three more
years of eligibility.

Starting middle guard Jerry
Boyarsky sprained an ankle in the
North Carolina game, and _ ac‘-
cording to A Sherrill, “probably
won't play Saturday.”

Dave Bucklew, who started the
Kansas" game, willprobably start in
place of Boyarsky, while Jay Pelusi
will be the backup. Kurt Brechbill,
whowas the second middle guard,
may be switched to backup tackle.

If past games are any indication,-
Pitt should fare quite well in
Philadelphia Saturday night. In
1975, Pitt beat the Owls, 55-6, and

Redshirt:iPros, Cons,  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The veer, the wishbone, the zone
». and the blitz are all commonly used;
weapons in big time "college
football today. There is, "however,
another device not mentioned
above that, in the long run, can
benefit a team as much or more.
Namely, the redshirt.
What a redshirt basically implies
. is that a player can sit out a year

without losing his eligibility.‘
Sounds great, right? Well, thoughA

it has some great advantages, a
redshirt can also represent trauma
for the player. '

There are two types of redshirt;
medical and non-medical. The
medical redshirt is self-explana-
tory. ‘For a player, the
‘non-medical redshirt is feared

because it puts him through a year '

of uncertainty and self-doubt.

You are in your first days. of _

summerfootball camp at a major
university. You were an all-state
performer in high school and were
recruited by over one hundred
schools. You lettered in three
sports in high school and never sat
the bench. But as the first couple
days of camp terminate you
. suddenly realize that you are just a

player among many and you are no - ‘

longer the focus of attention.
“You__ come to a big time

university like this, and the recruits

are all great, so you must learn to
take a backseat to the upperclass-
men. That’s okay because your
time will come eventually.” states
Ray Lao, one of the many talented
linebackers on the Pitt squad.

For a freshman expecting to
play, ‘finding he has been red-
shirted can be a severe~psycholog-
ical blow. The coach will usually
suggest "he sit out the year. The
A however, is
player’s hands.

In a way, being redshirted can be
taken as a compliment because
only good players" get redshirted.
In short, the coach feels you will
contribute in the future so. he
makes you .sit out a year so he can
utilize your talent to the fullest.

A redshirted player is allowed
to dress for all home games
practice, but he cannot participate
in more than two games in one
year, (note the case of linebacker
Jeff Pelusi, who is still eligible for a
redshirt even though he has been
present for the first two games). In
effect, the player is honing his
skills while not participating in

, game situations.

The advantages of redshirting a
player are obvious. The benefit to
the team is that the redshirt can
be utilized in the future. During
that year of non-competition, the
player can learnfrom the..more

For example, the day the Pantherettes arrived
in San Diego'from Hawaii, they had to ‘play
San Diego after only two hours of sleep. The
next morning, they had to awaken early for a
match with the eventual champion of the tour-

nament, UCLA.

“Fatigue played a major part in our play,’,’
said Hebert. “Traveling all the time—from city
to city, to restaurants and motels really wiped us

out.”

According to Hebert, there have been a lot qf
rumblings around the athletic department con-

cerning the Pantherette’s trip.

tes had to compensate by making sacrifices on
several of their other shorter trips such as using a

seasoned veterans some of the
skills of his particular position.

Another decisive factor which is
to the player’s beneﬁt is that the
school will pay for ﬁve academic
years. If a player turns down the
reshirt he can spend as much as
two to three on the bench, while
sitting out the year may mean
playing one to two years. There is
another side to being redshirted
that can be an emotionally draining
experience, if the player never
attains his potential. ‘

One of the sins for an athlete is
not being able to contribute. An
athlete who has been redshirted
may go through severe depression
that can eventually hurt his game.

The athlete will feel like he’s not
part of .the team, that he’s outcast.
These feelings could make him lose
that competitive intensity which is

, more so than anywhere else.

so essential for him to stay at peak
form.

Idleness is an athlete’s curse and
a redshirt could stir such feelings.
Even though he is practicing, he
knows he will not participate in any
games, so he may just be going
through the motions at practice.
He can lose that mental toughness
required to improve his skill.

The redshirting of a player is
seen as an improvement to the

squad and the player’s chances in 

the future. When this theory
backﬁres the individual crumbles
but the team goes on, nonetheless.

The redshirt is practiced by
every major college in the country
and it's just another factor of the
big business aspect of the game
where it is essential to utilize every
ounce of talent on the squad.

So what is it now, the veer, the-
wishbone, the zone, the blitz, or

the redshirt?

Reader Claims Last Week's Cover Story
Neglected = Feminist Music

The article by David Stubbs on the
American music scene was devoid of any
mention of feminist music. This lack of
coverage is my one major criticism of an
otherwise increasingly important supple-
ment to The Pitt News. 

Encouraging political activity in many I

issues of national concern, feminist music
is the example Stubbs was looking for.
Meg Christian, Holly Near and Alix
Dobkin, among others, strive for cultural
union with all races through political

lyrics -on such causes as feminism, rape

and lesbianism. -

Stubbs’ opinion is that American music
has, “taken on a trend of passiveness.”

_ It is interesting to note that he chose the

passive tense to express that partially
true statement. I do not own a radio b
cause the stations seem to only play
music of “Love, Hate and You Left Me,”
but I do own a record player and I can
listen to Meg Christian sing that if we
continue to ﬁght, “the rock (of sexism)

will wear away,” to Holly Near encourage
me to “Fight Back” against rapists and to
not be afraid of the night, or to Alix

Dobkin explain the lesbian experience

to me. These issues are in the papers
with the political activity to pass the ERA,
marches against rape and pornography,
and marches for lesbian and gay rights.
Throughout October, these activities will
be attended by thousands of people who"

will enjoy the music of artists ‘who '

continueto sing “some"sort of message
for itslisteners.” E '

Stubbs is right in many of his
statements, for example, that any
compartmentalized music is harder to
sell. Not only is it hard to sell, it is hard to
hear on your favorite music station.
Feminist musicians play the gamut’ of-
music, from soul to hard rock and
experimental to classical, yet they are
classiﬁed as “women's” music and
ghetto-ized. Pittsburgh has one radio
station that has one program devoted to
women's music, WYEP and Women Hold
Up 1/2 the Sky. If this is because station

managers don’t think there are people
who want to hear feminist music, they are
wrong. The 4th Annual Michigan
Woman’s Music Festival has grown in
four years from 700 participants to 7,000.
There is a growing awareness of this type
of music and a growing appreciation.

The conclusion to Stubbs article is.
pessimistic and, I feel, untrue. ‘He
writes, ‘.‘It. is" doubtful that the races. will
come any closer together . . . .” At the
Woman’s Music Festival women of many
races listened to both black and white
musicians. The ALIVE! band uniﬁed us
in their Rhumba ﬁnale and “Family”
disco encore. Under feminism the races
unite in their common stuggle against
sexism. V American music still sends a
message to_ itstpeople, the radio stations
and top-10 artists just don’t play it.

Blues Activist Dane SingsAbout ‘Freedom

ay MARK HOLAN

Barbara Dane is not atypical late "70s
performer. In an age of electric guitars

' and disco, she prefers acoustic folk and

blues music. In a profession of ﬂashy
overnight millionaires, she has remained

low-key and modest during a 25 year ’

career. Dane is not self-centered;
instead, she sings about the struggles of
others. _

Dane has been a political ‘activist

‘through-out most. of her career. In the

‘60s, her causes were the civil rights and
anti-war movements. She was the
coordinatorlof the “SING-IN FOR
PEACE” festival at Carnegie Hall, and
toured GI bases in Vietnam with Jane
Fonda, Donald Sutherland and Dick
Gregory.

Dane also was instrumental in breaking
the cultural blockade against Cuba, in
1966 by becoming the ﬁrst American
singer to tour the island.

Today, Dane sings about the causes of

< the women‘s movement, the rights of

workers and the anti-nuclear movement.
Most importantly, however, she sings
about the freedom individuals should
have from government. ,

Dane appeared recently at Wobblie
Joe‘s in the South Side; Wobblie‘s is'one
of..the few bars in Pittsburgh that would
host such a controversial singer. She
dressed in black slacks and white top,
smiling throughout her four hour set and
punctuating each song with . stories,
anectdotes and the rhetoric of freedom.

Her songs reflect her attitudes:
“Which Side Are You On,” “Sisters, You
Keep Me Fighting,” “Midnight Special”
and “House Of the Rising Sun” are only

' a few example. » .

Because she has sung for freedom
causes so long, and participated in many
struggles, Dane has developed a very
realistic view of revolution.

‘_.‘Songs can't make a revolution," she
said during a post-performance inter-
view. “But you can't make a revolution
without songs. One of the problems in
the ‘60s was that alot of people thought
that because there were protest songs,
there would be a revolution.”

The presence of protest songs, Dane
reasons, only serves to make “the
system” look more ﬂexible than it is.
Quoting a forgotten source, Dane smiled
and said “ ‘The revolution will not be
‘televised. ’ ’

Dane said she believes the country is in
a “lull before the storm,” alluding to
revolution that will be more far-reaching V

and have’ greater impact than the social :

upheavalsof the ‘60s. , _.

“More organization is needed and
seperate issues (women, labor, nukes)‘
will have to come together,” she said, in

 order for this new revolution to be
‘ successful. ‘

Most of Dane’s music is blues. She I
said she considers herself to have been a

' pioneer of the great blues revival in the

‘SOs. A feature story in Time magazine

. call her “one of the few white blues

singers who ever belonged there.”
Indeed, Through-out her career Dane

has worked with Muddy Waters,’

Memphis Slim, Willie Dexon and Louis

Armstrong. She opened a blues "club in I '

San Francisco‘called,Sugar Hill, and in
1959 became .the ﬁrst white woman to be
featured in Ebony magazine.-

Barbara Dane is almost always touri'ng
and singing her songs of freedom to yet
another generation of activists. Recently
she founded Paradon Records, which
encourages and distributes the work of
singers with similiar goals.

Barbara Dane, a blues singer and political activist, looks forward to a new

A revolution in America.

Pittsburgh Record Stores: Price, Selection And Service

By JON A. KASUNIC
AND scorr MOWRY

For the many tastes and varieties in
styles that exist in music today, the city of
Pittsburgh offers just as many choices of
where that music, in the form of records
and tapes, can be bought and sold. The
distinctions can be found in many areas,
but probably the most -important is the
prices. For many, cost is all that matters.
However, location, selection, atmosphere
and attitude of the service p_ersonnel can
also be equally important determinants in
one’s decision of where to buy albums.

National Record Mart, which has
nearly monopolized record sales in this
city, puts ' tremendous pressure on
competitors through steady advertisement
as well as the familiarity of its name to the
public. For these reasons, other
independently owned stores have difficul-
ty competing with the 13 National Record
Marts in the Pittsburgh vicinity. Added
to their overall strength, NRM also owns
the three Oasis stores in Pittsburgh plus
an additional shop in Youngstown, Ohio.
Considering this great power base, the
remaining independent companies cited"
NRM as their only major rivalry.

The NRM in Oakland is unique among
the National Record Mart chain because
of its direct appeal to the student
population centered in the area. Like the
remaining 12 stores, the Oakland location
offers spacious size, a very p'romotionally-
oriented decore andthe special service of
ticket sales for future area concerts. Its
most attractive feature, however, is the
wide and diversiﬁed inventory of many
kinds of music. -

This store displays a large variety of
new releases as well as sale Lps
(including specially discounted records
usually on view in the front windows).
A wall of ’ 11 racks is devoted to
best-selling albums, some of which are
specially priced. The entire second floor
is reserved for the sale. of budget and
cut-out aibums which have-been greatly
reduced in price due to record company

_overstocks and deletions. - A classical
music section can also be found in the
back of the store. Overall, NRM Oakland,
although persistent in its hard-sell, high
pressure attitude, is a well stocked,
moderately priced store with helpful
service. " _

The main National Record Mart
downtown is a far cry from its satellite in
Oakland. The store is loud in appearance
and somewhat resembles a 5 & 10 arcade.

The attitude of many employees at this

store is impersonal; although some are ’

courteous and willing to help. A plus for

the store is an extensive cut-out and"

budget selection which can be found at
various locations throughout its complex.

In the ‘front of the store is an “Artist
Appearing Soon" section, which contains

anywhere from 10-15 different displays.

A respectable selection of classical LP’s
and also a smallforeign music section is
also featured.

Adjacent to the store is a bookstore and
a ticket sales office, which is located in
the back of the bookstore.

The Oasis record shop in Bloomﬁeld,
part of the National Record Mart
corporation, is a magnificent and
remarkable store. Their other locations in
Pittsburgh include the recently added

North Hills and Monroeville “super
stores.” Oasishas a tremendous stock of
every type of music.‘ In the back of the
store is a studio-like set-up reserved for
artists who appear at the store when they
are booked for an area concert. Kansas

was the most recent — group to
appear at Oasis but ‘others such as"The
Beach Boys, Eddie Money and The
Fabulous Poodles have made guest visits
to Oasis stores in the past.

The aisles are spacious, the selection is '

excellent, and the employee staff is
similar to a small army. The albums
prices, high among Pittsburgh stores,
and bad location make for rather slow
business at Oasis. Also; the personnel do
not go out of their way to help buyers.
Sounds and Seeds on Bouquet Street, is

- situated in a handy location in relation to

the Pitt dorms. This combination
record/plant store is run by a group of
Pitt alumni. The plants provide a homey
and tranquil atmosphere and their
personnel are very friendly. They do not
have the advertising power or the name of
National Record Mart and therefore have
a somewhat difficult time competing with
their around-the-comer rival. ’

This is a quiet, easy, and relaxed place
to shop, for albums. The prices are
reasonable, and the manager of the store
said that they are doing their best to
compete with National Record Mart by
keeping them down. The "store is stll
fairly new and is .presently increasing
inventory. Plants can be found on the
second ﬂoor, and a head shop is located at

, the rear of the first ﬂoor. - _

Nestled in the heart of Shadyside, on

Walnut street, is The Listening Post.
Since it primarily caters to stereo and"
T.V; ‘equipment buyers, “The Post” is-
«able to keep record prices lower than
other stores in the Pittsburgh area.

Consequently, The Listening’ Post offers _

the City’s most consistently low prices,
most especially on major new releases.

The album‘ selection however, is small
without a strong backlog of older records
to choose from. Still, most of the top jazz,
rock, disco, and pop LP’s are available at

terriﬁc prices. ~c_.. .
Heads Together, in. Squirrel ‘Hill's «

underground mall, is -« a record shop,
clothing store, head shop, and waterbed
showroom. Although Heads Together
lacks the size of Oasis or the atmosphere
of_ Sounds and Seeds, all standard LP’s
are marked at a fair price of $5.99.

~ The two person management of Heads
Together believes that their business

would never survive without the other ,

departments. They contend that unless a
record store has been established in the

community for a number of.years, it, can

not make it through record sales alone.
Heads Together has been in operation for

nearly 10-years, but ‘has always kept the ‘ I

other departments. . .
Heads Together is patronized largely
by a rock ‘n’ roll crowd, however, the
store carries a variety of disco and soul
LP’s.
records, and also a small section of
cut-out budget and import LP’s._’ The
personnel could possibly be more
friendly, but in all fairness, they will give
you help if you ask for it. . .

Bringing alternative theatre to Pitts-
burgh is the objective of the 99 cent
Floating Theatre. And the variation the
Floating Theatre will bring to the
Pittsburgh area this year, the broad
spectrum of exploratory theatre with one
show totally different from every other, IS
receiving a warm reception here. Q

In afﬁliation with the University of
Pittsburgh, the 99 cent Floating Theatre
brings to the Pittsburgh stage a vast,
creative array of some major examples of
alternative theater. It will give audiences
a chance to wander, to move from the
matrix of traditional.

“I like to think of it as theatre-over-the-
edge,” said Dr. Leon Katz, director of the
Floating Theatre. “Altemative theatre is
like possibility and probability. It has
little to do with the norm of the
traditional. ’ ’

Alternative theatre is nothing new.
Sometimes known as avant-garde
theater, alternative has a history of about
100 years. It is the creative artists’
chance to move beyond the boundaries
and common realms of the traditional
theatre.

In its history with Pittsburgh aud-
iences, alternative theatre, especially the
type brought in by the Floating Theatre,
grew out of the theatre of the late 1960s
and mid-70s and the anti-establishment
beliefs of youth. Today, alternative
theatre has bloomed from its stage‘ of
against-the-grain audiences, mainly

-younger crowds, to a major, legitimate,

recognized form.

The Floating Theatre’s purpose is to
reach out to different areas, a type of
community service group. Dr. Katz

explained how the Floating Theatre tries ‘

to reach out to special groups, like
bringing performances to Western

Penitentiary, as well as high schools in
outlying regions, where they assist in
workshops. '

But Floating Theatre’s reputation
extends much farther than the Pittsburgh
area. Not only are they one of the most
respected organizations in the country,
but in a recent international theatre
conference in Bulgaria, 99 cent Floating

(Theatre was chosen as the company

exemplary of fine alternative theatre.

99 cent Floating Theatre is providing
Pittsburgh with this increased visibility,
this advent of the alternative. V

This year, the Floating Theatre has_
brought in The Ridiculous Theatre
Company's “Bluebeard,” as well as Jeff

/Weiss’ auto-performance that received

highly laudatory reviews at La Mama in
New York. ,

p Coming to the Floating Theatre Art
Festival will be “Schmaltz,” a cabaret-
type parody of nostalgia about blues

singer Helen Morgan.

After that, Floating Theatre will have
the Royal Dancers from the Kingdom of
Bhutan doing their first performance
outside of their own country. They’re
doing it here in Pittsburgh before moving
on to New York. A .

Next will be Meredith Monk, a
performer. reminiscent of the Martha
Graham-style alternative.

The University of Pittsburgh has been
willing to assist the 99 -cent Floating
Theatre, something many colleges would
never think of because of’ its variance
from the norm. But Pittsburgh has
responded by making a tremendous rush
for ‘season passes, much more than
director Katz ever imagined.

The Floating Theatre is giving

A Aycl<bourn’s ‘Absent Friends‘ Kicks Playhouseseason

I

By MARK HOLAN

Absent Friends
Directed by James 0., Prescott
Playhouse Theater Company

“Absent Friends” is.an afternoon soap
opera with punch lines. It is a lukewarm
satire of English suburbia by Alan
Ayckbourn, author of “The Norman
Conquests.” The satire, however, is
mild, and the audience can never give
itself over to riotous laughter. '

The play revolves around six friends
who gather for tea on a Saturday
afternoon. The purpose of‘ the gathering
is to" console an old friend, Colin (Don
Wadsworth), whose girlfriend has died
recently. ‘Rather than a cheering-up party
for Colin, however. the tea becomes a
forum for the other f*ive’s problems; the
triﬂes and trivialities of their suburban
lives. ’

Colin’s friends are: Paul (Hugh A.
Rose) and his wife Diana (Kate Young),
John (Raymond Laine) and his wife
Evelyn (Maura Minteer) and Marge
(Nancy Chesney).

- The classic elements in this suburban
soap include Diana’s realization that Paul
is having an affair, Evelyn's confession to
Marge that she .is_ the other woman,
J ohn’s acceptance of the affair because of
his business relationship with Paul,
Colin’s hidden grief and John's uneasi-
ness with the subject of death. This last
element is easily the funniest part of the
play. Yet ‘each of these problems is so

. cliche that the play itself comes very close
to being trivial. -

Only Ayckbourn’s fine command of
everyday dialogue and good acting help

SHOWCASE on

Art

By JANICE SCHULER.

“Paintings From the Real World” is an
exhibition of paintings by Budd Gibbons
currently at the Pittsburgh Plan for Art
until October 7. These slice of life images
are a blend of impressionism, abstraction
and naturalism. Sitting on a stoop.
reading in the ‘afternoon. a frenzied
forest, cows grazing. seascapes, snow
scenes and beaches are focal images for

' , Gibbons.

Don Wadsworth, Raymond Laine and Hugh Rose reminisce about old-times in a scene
from ‘AbsentFriends,’ now playing at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. ‘P

to save the production. Perhaps the best
part of “Absent Friends” is the
extremely attractive living room set by
Eileen Garrigan (with a little help from
Wick’s Furniture). ’

The problems of English suburbia, it
seems, are very similar to those of

“I am trying with the roughness of the
marks and the smoothness of the illusion

to create a tension that corresponds to the

dynamic contrasts I see in nature,”
Gibbons said of his work.

“Afternoon Reading" is rich in
patterning and texture. The seated
woman is bathed in an erratic. diffused
light and offers mazelike surface.

“Summer” is a good study in light and
shadow reminiscent of Edward Hopper
paintings. Gibbons’ marks reflect
warmth and earthiness, providing us with
an intimacy with the subject. -

Ameigcan suburbia. The audience laughs
only ecause it has experienced the same
real life feuds portrayed in “Absent
Friends.”

The play will not fail to make you
chuckle a little, but anyone could have
just as much fun in their own living room.

   it Pittsburgh Plan For ArtFeatures ,WorksOf Gibbons

The majority of" the pieces are
landscapes but only a few are
independent of the traditional stiffness so
often associated with that genre. “Big

Meadows” looks like some enchanted
foest with its seductive light and
shadowing. It is almost abstract in its '

rendition of trees and foilage, yet brings
colors to the forest you feel are there and
kndw should be there. “Woods Stream”
has an overwhelming gathering of leaves.
trees and other wooded growth that blend
into one highly textured surface like a
tapestry. Some of thexbrushstrokes look
rushed but others look as though they

There are no insights or answers offered 4
.in “Absent Friends” but ‘there really

“Absent Friends” runs through
October 7. '

o

were done with_an intentional velocity.

The strongest pieces in the show are
the beach paintings “Sandy Point” and
“Ed.” The shapes are generalized, with
Gibbon’s marks reﬂecting mood rather
than loyalty to form.

Giblbons is a highly skilled painter,
knowledgable of the ﬁgure. light and
shadow. He brings a tender reality to his
images. His woods paintings are the
most personal. The marks seem tq. be
guided by some inspired urgency’. as
opposed to the still lifes and ﬁgures which
seems more like academic exercises. '

‘Shopping. Center near South Park.
‘exhibits an impressive appearance. Yet

underneath all the glitter and glamour
lies a less-than-adequate selection and
high prices. These two‘ negative factors
have seemingly not affected sales.
Business is doing well, according to the

' H stores’ management.

The management believes the major
competitors are the National Record
Marts and also the Oasis stores. They
contend that Peaches offers a unique
place to shop -for records which
outmeasures every other record outlet in
the area. , _ '

Peaches has an excellent import

’ ‘selection and a ﬁne classical selection.

Many artists ‘who are scheduled to
perform concerts in Pittsburgh make
guest appearances at Peaches. Among
the performers who have visited Peaches
include: Linda Rondstadt, Styx, Ted
Nugent, and Bill Buford. I

Peaches employs a large number of
sales people who lend a great deal of
friendly service to customers. '

Perhaps Pittsburgh's most unique
record shop is Jim’s Records, which
recently moved one block up Liberty Ave.

‘Sole owner Jim Spitznagel has centered

his record business in the Bloomfield part
-of the city for the" past 2 '1/2 -years,
working out of several locations. ,
Jim’s records, which Spitznagel de-
scribes as an “alternative” record shop to
all others in Pittsburgh, specializes in

new wave, reggae and progressive jazz ,

and draws its stock from all over the
A major aspect of Jim’s
Records’ service is a very comprehensive
singles selection, featuring rare and
hard-to-get 45s from many different
artists, new and old. .

A With its New York/London shop
atmosphere, Jim’s _Records offers a
specialty service of providing alternative
music to atypical consumers. Con-
sequently, Jim’s Records’ patrons are
usually small innumber but very loyal
and frequent in their support. Spitznagel

- claims that 60 percent of  customers

come from the surrounding colleges and
universities. ‘ ,-

With the continuing upward spiral of
record costs, Jim"s also attempts to
counter-act the inﬂationary trends with
the sale of used records at substantial
savings. ‘

The Record Graveyard, on Forbes
Ave., is another highly unique record
store which ﬁrstly specializes in thesale
of used albums. Not only does The
Graveyard sell used albums on a regular
basis but will buy unwanted records at
one dollar per album as well. It also has

available unused’ albums which may.

arrive at-The Graveyard the same time, or
possibly even before, other record stores
obtain them.

With the prices generally ranging from
two to three dollars, and the albums in
good to excellent condition, it may well
be, at times, the best deal around. The
albums are constantly coming in and
going out. The stock is good and there is
a wide variety of albums to choose from.

Clone Records. in the South Hills,
Pittsburgh's newest record outlet has
only been in operation for the past nine
months. To stay in business the store has
attempted to expand their operation to
include hobbies, war games, and small

inventory of musical instruments,

- Records have appeared to have taken on

less importance in Clone Records, due to
higher list prices and a cutback in
consumption. 

Owners Dan M_etzger and Tom
Johnston claim their primary customers
come from the local South Hills schodls
and therefore Clone Records features a
stock of basically hard rock and heavy

metal.
Where an individual purchases his

records certainly depends on personal
tastes. Selection, atmosphere andprice
varies from store to store. Most of the

_.stores mentioned in this article are

located within easy access of campus,
either by walking or by bus.‘ A good
shopper should have no problem finding

the album he is looking for at an,

affordable price.

Religion ,Parodied In Monty Python's Film ‘Life OiBriqn'  

By FORREST BUFFENMYER \

Monty Python’s Life of Brian

‘ Directed by Terry Jones

‘ Good hews for those of you who

thoroughly enjoyed “Monty Python and

 

the Holy Grail”——the new Python ﬁlm,
"Monty Python’s Life of Brian,” has
been released and is now playing in
Oal_rland’s King's Court Theater.

But now for some bad news: the
“zany” wit of previous Python antics

'_ doesn't pervade this new ﬁlm, but hides

 

Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate with his aid John Cleese in a scene from

p “Monty Python’s Life of Brian.’

1

instead behind satire, satire that really
overﬂows over the sides and up the movie-

aisle to the audience, all of whom sit there I

-and take turns nodding headshand
muttering “yes, that's true.” In short,
intelligent comedy, not the silly» style of
humor that made this British sixsome
famous. ' — ~.
In “Holy Grail” we soon knew what the
driving force, the motivation of the plot

was going to be—-to recover the Holy _

Grail. Here religion was satirized as the
film progressed, and although a definite
part of the plot, it was not the main focus
of attack. Rather the ritual side of it was
lampooned, the fact that King Arthur and
his men would lie, cheat, steal, and kill to
get the Grail defeated the meaning it
held. Also, the_object soon became more
important than what it symbolized.
When Arthur is charged by God to
retrieve the Grail he gives no thought to

what it means, but rather just views it as .
a “sacred mission”—he becomes, in

short, God’s errand boy.

Such is not the case in “Life of Brian,”
however. Here the plot’s only real drive
or focus, is to satirize religion, with some

humor on the side. This_is quite different '

than “Grail’s” humor with religious
satire on the side. In “Grail” Python
used a rather blatant satire, to the point
of absurdity. But in ‘.‘Brian” the satire is
much mor su_btle, much more pointed. _

It’s a pity that the plot isn’t. The
viewer doesn't get a hint of what Brian’s
fate is until fully 2/3 of the way into the
film. It also doesn’t‘blend in the skits and
vignettes as smoothly as “Grail,” but
instead chops them up, making the
viewer more aware of how ragged their
edges are.

The plot is simple: Brian, an ordinary-

lad, is born at the same time as Jesus '

Christ, and later on is confused by a’

\

group as‘ Him.
Messiah, Graham Chapman (as Brian)
shows us just how stupid people are: . _

Hailed _as the new _

Bootleg Albums: Bargain To Buyers, Rip-Off To Artists 7  

~ By MIKE RAVASIO

Although Joni Mitchell has shown jazz
influences in her music since the album
“Court and Spark,” she has taken a
quantum leap in that direction with her
recent release, “Mingus.” A

The album is dedicated‘ to the great
bassist and composer Charles Mingus,

Get, The Knack

/ 5‘? The Knack

Capitol

There are a lot of inaccuracies
concerning this record, so let’s dispel
’ some ‘of them.
To begin with, the Knack are not and
will never be the Beatles. Period. Any-

one who dislikes them for this reason ,_is_ ,
either still suffering from the post-Beatle ‘

breakup blues, or is not fully aware of the
enormous amount of satire and sarcasm
this record is wrapped in. '
Every foursome with any amount of
popularity in the past ten years have been
hailed as the new.Beatles—Cheap Trick,
Klaatu, the Raspberries, you name it; and

“i"«‘if the Who had started in 1970 instead of

the early 605, then they would 7 have
probably been hyped as the new Beatles.
Just look at the way. the ﬁrst album by
Klaatu sold several years ago, strictly on
the rumor that it might,‘ just might, be the
Beatles. Same record label, a ‘few
obscure clues, and poof! The new (?)
Beatlesrecord. Face it, the Fab Four are
gone, and. they’re not coming back.
Now as for the satire; it’s just so blatant
that you can’t miss it. But don’t mistake

it for something it’s_not. The Knack are —

parodying the Beatles, not imitating
them; This is apparent from their style of
dress to the album’s back cover to the

'*3"same record label used on the Beatles’

ﬁrst release.

But the biggest fun is in the music.
Some songs sound very close to the
Beatles—like “Maybe Tonight,” with its
tape-reversed cymbals and flute/ recorder
backing (making it sound like a carbon
bopy of “Strawberry Fields Forever”).
But the lyric undercuts this, like the best
parody—,-set up the victim, make him feel
comfortable‘, then knock him down. The
words tellof a_ girl who. gives her all (both
physically and emotionally) to her guy,
but can’t understand why he doesn’t tell
her he loves her. He responds that
“maybe tonight” hewill, but we all know
damned well he won’t. The early Beatles

$‘».were always the broken-hearted ones," the

ones who could always be trusted because
they were kind, understanding, etc. But

the Knack have been tempered by ’

heartbreak, and are now out to strike back

andbreak some hearts of their own. _'The '

Bootlegs offer several advantages to ‘

advantages. The quality of some bootleg
recordings is very poor but most
A important is, these albums are illegal.
Bootlegs, whether recorded off of FM
broadcasts, mixing boards at concerts, or
tapes that have been discarded by groups
(some albums have actually been made
from tapes found-in garbage cans) are
infringements on copyrights, and rob the
performers of deserved royalties. The
only personlwho makes all money on a

' bootleg record is the bootleggar himself.

According to a recent article in Rolling
Stone, Bruce Springsteen and - CBS
Incorporated have sued for approximately
$2 million damages against a California
bootlegger. - ‘ _

Andrea Waters and 4 other defendants
are being sued for. infringement of
copyright, unfair competition, unjust

enrichment and unaurthorized use
name and likeness.

CBS and Springsteen are seel
damages from the manufacture of
unauthorized albums. “E-Ticket”,
“Piece de Resistance”, “Fire”, and
“Live in the Promisedland”; '

“It’s just out and out theft; somebody
hasstolen something and we want it
“back,” said Jon Landau, Springsteen’s
manager-producer.

If anyone was interested in buying
bootlegs, all he need do is thumb through
the back pages of rock magazines like

sometimes confusing, often moving, and
at‘ times amusing album that presents a
picture of both the complex man and

Knack are graduates of the School of
Hard Knocks, and are determined to hurt

ﬁrst and ask questions later. But there
certainly is substance here, stuff behind

the satire. The Knack sing even ballads M
with a chainsaw edge to them, and’

throughout there's an underlying vic-
iousness here.
Theylare out of place--men in their late

twenties singing about the problems of .

adolescence. But the guise just adds to
the satire, tired old men moaning about
lost teenage loves. The difference is the
ten years between their actual ages and
what they sing about has given them their
tough-as-nails’ stance—-experience has
been a painful thing. They’re out for a
good time now, no matter what it takes.
Some songs are very blatant in their
, apparent use-and-abuse view of women:
“My Sharona,” “Good Girls Don’t” and
“(She’s So) Selﬁsh,” for instance. ’
' These three songs in particular and the
' whole album in general bring to mind the
thin veneer of the Beatles appearance
that the Knack use to get across their
point, twisted though it might be. When
the Beatles sang that they wanted to hold
your hand, it was understood that sexual
acts of‘ some nature would eventually
follow. But the Knack leave no stone
unturned; they want to make SURE you
understand the situation and what’s
happening in it. In this fashion the Knack
bring to mind both punk rock and the
Rolling Stones, at both the Stones’ best
and worst. Mick Jagger doesn’t leave a
lot to your imagination when he growls,
“I'm trying to make some girl, but she
says, "Baby come back, maybe next
week.’ ” ' ’ ' '

serves to ﬂesh out the score." High caliber
musicians such as J aco_ Pastorius, Wayne
Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Phil Woods,
Tony Williams offer background and
embellishments but Mitchell’s singing
always takes the spotlight. Her mastery
of complex jazz phrasings will simply
amaze; and as always, Mitchell’s voice is
able to convey a tremendous range: of
emotion. . .

album like this? Maybe that’s why the

Knack do it, to attract attention. to

themselves.- - ~ .

They like to do that, too. How'can you
not be caught up in the powerful
backbeat, beautifully constructed and
organized, of‘“My Sharona”? The lyrics
are deliberately muddled and unclear,
making it the perfect AM hit. But a listen
will reveal the same style and wit that
permeates the entire record. In this song
in particular Bruce Gary's drums and
Prescott Niles_’ bass drive the song along,

never relenting. With the addition of
Doug Fieger’s rhythm guitarwork, the
song snaps alive, like monstrous Rice
Krispies upon the addition of milk.-

But the Knack fails in its attempts to
fuel "the old Buddy Holly song,
“Heartbeat,” with some of the vicious-
ness, mistrust and downright. hatred that
powers many of the other songs. Warren‘
Zevon energizes his music with violence
and pure insanity, as in the song
“Excitable Boy.” But the Knack rely on
theidarker emotions to give their music
life. '

And speaking of Holly—he is the real
inﬂuence here, not the famed John, Paul,
George and Ringo, who themselves admit
and acknowledge their debt ‘to Holly's

«music (as well as Elvis Presley's) in
forming their own. At times, lead vocalist
Fieger sounds like an arised Holly, at
other times he makes us believe he never
left. '

It’s almost as if Holly., grew up. got

smarter and more experienced, maybe \

had a fewvbad moments at the hands of
the female characters that populate this
record, -and made this album himself.
Those who saw “The Buddy Holly
Story,” if you believe its accuracy, could
easily see Holly eventually rebelling
against such women in a fashion very

' similiar to, if not identical to‘, the way
Feiger and company behave. Holly, like
the Knack, could be determined to be the
survivor in a world where only the strong
live to see the next sunrise.

Nearly all of these songs are good, and
some are better than others. The Knack
‘waste no time in rocking, and kick .the
record in with “Let Me Out,” one of the

ongs describing the feelings just

“Mingus” is not easy to listen. to,

A’ because it demands attention. The album
_i in radically different from anything
Mitchell has done before-,

She has
pushed herself ‘beyond a preconceived
limitations, producing an album that is‘ a
ﬁtting tribute to Charles Mingus, the
musician and the man. In that sense the
album is a successs-and a true work of art-.

complimentary bass/guitarwork. -
The song “(She’s So) Selﬁsh.” is very

‘ bitter and nasty-, with an’ edge that
threatens any female in its immediate"

vicinity. All men have experienced or
have’ at least known of such a girl (-“I
think you know this girl, Iknow you do,”

sings Feiger at the song's end), and these
kind—— of women generally" stir such ‘hate, -

contempt and bitterness in’. men and
sometimes even women.

“Good Girls Don’t” makes the girl the i

villain, as she is pictured as someone who
teases but doesn’t deliver (the common

theme). Therefore upon relenting.at"last «
. Feiger makes her appear to get what she

deserves.

“Lucinda” is the closest to a serious,
unoffensive ballad the Knack have to
offer. In short, Feiger is in a somewhat
compassionate, if very guarded, mood-

caught between the traditional rock and a ‘

hard place, Feiger warnstothers of his
fate to stop it from befalling’ them.

But the strikes back in “Frustrated,”
about guess what? Lineslike, ‘‘She’s a,
teasertonight, but you know she'll turn it

off when you turn down- the light,” set the j .

stage for the Knack’s ﬁnal attack on
womenkind, particularly those ‘whoa don't
“put out” on command. And that brings

us to the record’s biggest failing—their 

attitude and how it perpetrates itself.

It’s about time someone put down on -» '
record what really happens: that some 5_

women attack when hurt, and are (as
judged by Feiger) the worthy recipients of
his wrath. Men also tend to attack when.
hurt, to be cold, but in our society that’s
okay, the men are heroes for that. And-
this is the Knack’s most objectionable
quality, the double standard. A vicious
cycle can only be ended by one side
ﬁnally softening up, and that’s the sad.
part, because Feiger will never do that,
and‘ will therefore always have his
mistrust reinforced. After all, if you are
convinced that the whole world is against
you, then it will be. It's! that simple.

So, the music here is good, far above
just average. A
content, but rather be empathetic,
because Feiger and company cannot love.

They can only hurt and hurt and hurt‘ '
some more, .as they search for love that -
will never .come to them. And that’s a .
-- very sad fate indeed. _i ‘ - .- . 0
