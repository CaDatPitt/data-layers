Dnor support fuels faculty raises

by Estelle Tran
Aaetzbta/zt Netua E3itor

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Board of Trustees’ Compensation
Committee weighed salary increas-
es against the institution’s ﬁnancial
situation at its meeting yesterday.

Salary decisions were set for
nonéofﬁcers at the University in
August, after the Board adopted

the University’s new operating
budget. The salaries of continuing
faculty members will increase 5.2
percent on average.

Despite the worldwide economic
struggles, Vice Chancellor of Pub-
lic Affairs Robert Hill said that Pitt
enjoys continuing support from
donors, alumni and friends of the
University. Pitt has 50,213 total

donors. The University’s $2 billion
capital campaign raised $1.273 bil-
lion as of June 30, the end of the
last ﬁscal year. This ﬁgure passed
the $1.3 billion mark.

Pitt determines many salary in-
creases based on performance in
the previous year, and for this rea-
son, the board will consider salary
increases for University ofﬁcers af-

ter it can take enrollment, ﬁnance 4

and fundraising ﬁgures into ac-
count, according to a news release.
Hill said that the University has a
plan if the economy worsens.

“\X/e’ll be making adjustments.
We can by ‘making adjustments in
Various units. We can delay 
positions and not ﬁlling various
vacancies,” said Hill.

At the meeting, the board ac-
knowledged other achievements
this year. Pitt recruited higher
achieving students, with 78 per-
cent of the freshman class ranked
in the top 20 percent of their high
school graduating classes. The
University also chose these stu—_
dents from the largest applicant

pool it has ever received: 20,639

Pittsburgh police Sgt. Doug
Epler told the class not to worry
about the bags of white powder
he was passing around.

Nothing was real, he said, and
everything was clean. G

“I wouldn’t put your hands
around your mouth though,” he
said. A

Epler visited the Pittsburgh
Bureau of Police Citizens’ Police
Academy class to teach regular
city residents about the narcotics

investigative squad. He brought
fake drugs and paraphernalia to
show the students signs of drugs
in their neighborhoods.

The class awkwardly passed
around bongs,,rolling papers and
examples of joints and crack
pipes. Some students curiously
smelled the objects.

Others tried to ﬁgure out what
the substances really were. V

“That’s oregano,” one student
said knowingly.

Police Academy talks Pittsburgh drugs scene

Epler said that Pittsburgh’s her-
oin use constitutes for most drug
arrests. He said heroin presents a
problem in all parts of the city —

expensive and inexpensive areas. -

‘People from outer counties, such
as Somerset and Butler, often
drive to Pittsburgh to get cheaper
heroin.
“Why are we the \Y/al—Mart of
heroin sales?” asked one student.
Epler said it’s common for‘
all cities to sell drugsat cheaper

rates than in rural areas and that

the narcotics team only saw an
increase in heroin use in the past
six years. ‘ ’

“The purity level has gon
through the roof,” said Epler. “It’s
80 to 90 percent. It used to be 40
to 50 percent.”

Heroin is derived from mor-
phine, which comes from the
opium poppy plant, according to
the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. It can cause fatal overdose

The holidays are a happy time,
but not for everyone. i

“Holidays in particular can be
difficult times for people that are
grieving,” said Allan Zuckoff, a
professor in Pitt’s School of Med-
ieine. “At these times we tend to
expect ourselves to'be happy. If
we’re not happy we might feel out
of place and might get upset with
ourselves or feel that we have to
isolate ourselves.”

said Zuckoff. He focused on grief
resulting from the death of a loved
one during his lecture.
“Bereavement is something We
all experience. It’s the cost of lov-

l ing people,” said Zuckoff.

The ﬁrst days, weeks or months
are considered early stages of .
grief. At this time it’s not uncom-
mon for the mourner to feel an-
ger, regret or nervousness over the
loved one’s death. If the mourner
remembers something particularly
funny or comforting about the
deceased, even positive emotions
can surface albeit they are initially
only temporary, said Zuckoff.

As grief runs its course, these
positive emotions overpower the

Author talks °stimulationat Honors College lecture

by Molly Steiber
Stafj" U7/*iter -

Norman  Ornstein said, that
we are entering the “Cialis peri-
od.”

“We are entering a period of
an extremely stimulated econo-
my. I_would like to refer to this as
the ‘Cialis’ period, and it will last
longer than four hours, too,” he
said. '

Pitt’s University ‘Honors Col-
lege. hosted renowned political
scientists and authors Ornstein
and -Thomas E. Mann to talk
about the results of the most
recent electionand how_it will
affect the future of the United
States and U.S. politics.

The title of the lecture was.

“After the 2008 Elections: How
can they govern?” which was in-
cluded as part of the ‘American
Experience Distinguished. Lec-
ture Series. Previous lecturers
include George H. W. Bush and
Sen. Bob Casey. .
The evening began in the ball-

room in the second floor of the
Twentieth Century Club. Pitt_pro-
fessor of political science Susan
B. Hansen introduced the two
guest speakers.

‘ Ornstein is a resident scholar
at the American Enterprise Insti-
tute and has also made appear-
ances in The New York Times,
the Washington Post and the Wall
Street journal.

Mann is the W Averell Har-
riman chair and se_nior fellow in
governance studies_at The Brook-
ings Institution.

Ornstein and Mann have both
been in Washington for 39 years
and have admitted to never see-
ing as much dysfunction in -the

' U.S. government as they have in

the past eight years.

Ornstein began by praising
President-elect Barack Obama
for his attitude toward President
Bush. '

“When Obama told Bush that
he understood there can only be
one president at a time, Bush
replied that .is not what Dick

' addressed the

Cheney told him,” said Ornstein
jokingly. . , ‘

All joking aside, Ornstein
difficulties that
Obama faces. No matter how
conﬁdent he is going in to office,

the issues that he faces cannot be-

resolved overnight. The damage

Obama cannot

simply wave a magic
wand.

Norman _
Ornstein

that has been done in the past
eight years was described by Orn-
stein as two waves of category
four hurricanes. .
“Obama cannot simply wave a
magic wand,” said Ornstein.
T’ Still, the issue of Congressio-
nal support was repeated from

both speakers throughout the

lecture. Obama is the one of four’

Democratic nominees to win by
a clear majority. Obama also has
the advantage of taking ofﬁce
with a majority of Democrats in
the House of Representatives. ‘

“Relative to Bill Clinton and
jimmy _Carter, Obama has more
experience in Washington,” said
Mann. C

Mann also emphasized how
Obama is not threatened by able

i_people and has an enormous

amount of self—conﬁdence.

, “Theiobstacles he will face are
enormous. He must improve the
image of the U.S. to the world
and also improve and ‘restore
trust in the government, whichas
of ‘right now is at a historic low,”
said Mann.

Obama will have the chance
to make decisions, and there are
many debates over what_those
decisions should be.

‘ “Many politicians are telling

Obama to think big and make
very drastic changes. Others,
however, suggest that overreach—

ing risks another failed presiden-

cy, something we simply can not

afford right now,” said Mann.
This is a very difficult time to

be a member of Congress. One 7
of Mann and Ornstein’s goals‘

is to try and explain to the pub-
lic just how difficult it is to be a
member of Congress.

Democrats picked up momen-
tum in 2006 because the public
blamed the Republicans for. the
many problems that began to
arise. With 30 retiring Republi-
cans from the House of Repre-
sentatives, it was no surprise that
the Democrats are taking the
clear majority when Obama en-
ters office, said Ornstein.

Overall, the two speakers are i
very optimistic about the future .

of U.S. politics vvith Obama’s
presidential victory.

“For the first time in _years,
conservatives, liberals and moder-
ates alike are all in agreement that
Obama has shown something we
are not used to seeing: real intel-
ligence,” said Mann.

is cooked into liquid and- injected
intravenously, it can spread the hu-
man immunodeficiency virus and
hepatitis. '

Dealers sell thewhite powdery
drug in very small amounts, mostly
in wax paper packets used for
stamp collecting. Sometimes deal-
ers put a stamp “brand” on their
drug for’ marketing, with names of
video games or movies, sai Epler.

Heroin usually arrives in Pitts-
burgh pre—packaged from Philadel-
phia, New Jersey and other areas,
he said.

Those dealers get the drugs‘

from overseas. V
Heroin is highly addictive, and

Epler said some people can’t func-

tion without snorting it when they

wake up_in the morning. But after‘

awhile, snorting heroin can “burn

out” the receptors in the user’s

nose, and the drug no longer pro-
vides a high. ‘T

At that point, the user turns to

— needles. ‘Epler took two cups of

vinegar and gave them to two stu-
dents to demonstrate how sharing
needles spreads disease.

He put yellow food dye in one
cup and green in the other to rep-
resent the blood of two people.

Using a syringe, he drew some of .

the fake coloredheroin from each
cup. .
Holding the syringe filled with
murky mixed liquid, Epler said that
not only do users share needles and
heroin, but they share ‘blood.

They usually need to draw
blood back into the syringe so
they can tell they have vein and not
muscle.

“Heroin is generally a team
sport,” said Epler.

Two impact squads, two inves-
tigative squads, a “weed-and-seed”
team and a “vice-unit” targeting
prostitution and gambling form

the narcotics division of the Pitts— '
V burgh Bureau of Police.

Epler’s unit, the investigative
squad, targets dealers and uses in-
formant tips to prepare for drug

J

busts.

Epler- said the impact squad
generally makes the drug user 
dealer arrests, which occur for her-
oin at a rate of about 2—to—1.

The second mostarrests come
from crack cocaine, formed when
cocaine powder is hardened for

Powder cocaine tends‘ to be more

suburban and “high—end”i than

. crack, he said. _One ounce can sell

for $1,000. ,

A National Institute on Drug
Addiction study in 2007 reported
that 7.8 percent of 12th graders
used cocaine in their lifetime as op-
posed to 1.5 percent for heroin.

Some convenience stores market

crack pipe materials together, said .

Epler.
They sell the products to make
a crack pipe near each other - cop-

per sink scrubbers, the temper glass '
tubes from cheap ﬂower bouquets

and ‘lighters. _ ~
“Those three don’t go together,”
said Epler. “Unless you do crack.”
The glass tubes allow the user
to smoke the drug, and the'cop—
per scrubber stops the user from
ingesting the ﬂaming hot crack.
Many times, users have burned

lips and ﬁngers from smoking‘

despite the hot pipe because they
don’t want to waste the drug, ‘he
said. i

  Officer: Heroin ‘generally a team sport’

Epler said he’s seen both mid-
dle—schoolers and geriatrics arrest-
ed for selling 

».Most_ people arrested for drug
use or dealing have heroin, crack
cocaine or marijuana. Epler said
in a populated city like Pittsburgh,
it’s hard to cook the methamphet-
arnines that are plaguing the Mid-
west. ‘

Since cooking meth requires
chemicals such as those found in
drain cleaners and fertilizer, the
stench isstrong, and it would be

difﬁcult to run a meth lab in a city. P

‘Thank heavensit hasn’t caught

on here,” said Epler. “Also, it’s an.

explosive. You would get caught

-very easily”

H ' Epler said it’s important that
people who notice drug problems

in their neighborhoods to call the P

Pittsburgh police.

, “It’s becoming a lot more popu-
lar to grow your own weed,” he
said. “If your neighbors’ yard

looks like crap and they’re bringing .

in potting soil, give us a call.”

Hill said that Pitt’s achievement is unlike
those of smaller, private institutions.

“It is easy to remain small and good, but
to be alarge school and grow and have high
quality, that’s a challenge,” said Hill.

The Board also highlighted Pitt’s increas-
ing research expenditures, which rose from
$620 million in 2007 to $642 million in 2008.
Pitt ranks sixth nationally in overall research

funding and 10th for support with federal
science and engineering research and devel-
opment.

The American Association of State Col-
leges and Universities reported that every $1
million spent in research and development
creates 36 jobs.

According to this statistic, Pitt’s work

with research is responsible for 23,000 local

“Generally, grief doesn’t end. But it

avoidance of reminders is not viable because
the mourner must have shared much of his
life with the lost loved one, said Zuckoff.

Zuckoff also presented ways to alleviate
grief. Some people found setting aside spe-
cific times to grieve helped.

But no cures are universal. Some might
ﬁnd relief in isolation while others may need
to be around people. Activities that alleviate
grief are diverse.

“If going shopping gives you comfort, go
shopping,” said Zuckoff. “If it’s more com-
forting to be in a crowd, be in a crow .”

Some grievers are disinclined to talk
about their situation with loved ones in fear 
of bringing them down too. But Zuckoff - 1:
recommends otherwise.

“Let the people in your life know what
you need from them. It can be Very simple
like letting them know you don’t feel like
reading Christmas cards this year,” said
Zuckoff. “The more concrete and specific
you are, the more helpful they’ll be.”

Higher education for all

‘Kari/zg tuition coata Jig/uzl needfo/‘A

EDITORIAL"

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

December 4, 2008

 

aoctkzlizedi /.2z,°g/aver e3u_c°atio/2

A new report from the Na-

tional Center for Public Policy‘

and Higher Education paints a
worrying picture of the future
of college affordability.
The report, “Measuring
_ Up 2008,” found that college
tuition and fees soared 439
percent, accounting for inﬂa-
tion, from 1982 to 2007.

Median family income, on-

the other hand, increased 147
percent. A

4‘ Furthermore, the rate at
which students take out loans

V, has more than doubled in the
past 10 years, and students are
receiving smaller grants from
colleges. A

Patrick M. Callan,-"president

of the center, told The New
York Times, “When we come
out of the recession, we’re re-
ally going to be in jeopardy,
because the educational gap
between our work force and
the rest of the world will make
it very hard to be competitive.

Already, we’re one of the
few countries where 25- to
34-year-olds are less educated
than older workers.”

This is a serious problem,
especially when considering
the ‘current economic climate,
as many Americans are strug-
gling to make ends meet.

_ If tuition and fees contin-
ue to rise at this alarming rate,
fewer and fewer students will
be able to attend college. I

Callan said that while col-
lege enrollment has risen _in
the past few years, this most
likely will -not continue.

“The middle class has been
ﬁnancing [higher education]
through debt,” Callan told the
Times. -

At this pace, colleges are
well on their way to becom-

ing strictly elitist institutions,’

much like they were in the past

when education was restricted
only to those who could af-
ford it.

Cash-strapped students are
burdened with debt when they
graduate and head into the
professional world.

Universities have become
businesses, seemingly more
concerned with making mon-
ey than educating students.

Somewhere down the road,
the emphasis on academics
was lost.

It’s time for the govern-

, ment to make a decision to

drastically change the edu-
cation system in the United
States.

Perhaps the solution to this
growing problem is socializing
higher education.

-Most Western, post-indus-
trialized nations, including
France,_the United Kingdom,
Switzerland and Germany,
have socialized education.

With socialization, higher
education will no longer be
restricted to those who can af-

ford it, but to those with the. '

academic qualiﬁcations.

Not only is this beneﬁcial
to students of any socioeco-
nomic status, but it would also
do a great deal of good for the
United States as a whole.

The effects of a skilled and

educated society will undoubt-_,'
edly spread throughout the _

country -

In today’s professional en-
vironment, it is safe to say that
a college degree is not simply
an asset, but rather a prerequi-
site for success.

In the United States, every
high school graduate should
have a chance at this success.

Higher education should
be made available 'to_ all, -re-

.gardless of where they stand

on the ﬁnancial ladder.

Kathryn Lucas dares to bare all in her new memoir.

0 Courtesy Kathryn Luas

 
   

by Colleen Counihan
Staﬂ W/rite/‘

Kathryn Lucas is not a stranger
to death. ,_ ‘

She watched her friend die in a
tragic boat accident when she was
16, and not more than a year lat-
er, she herself was declared dead
at the scene after being forced
through the windshield_ during a
head-on car collision. _

Now, at the age of 38, she has
crept back into" those memories
of her teen years and transferred
them to the page for others to
read. .

“The title speaks for itself,”
said Lucas about her new book in
a phone interview with The Pitt

News. “It is what it is-— you can .

dwell on things or you can try to
actually live with the past, look.at
it  an optimistic way and move

‘ forwar .”

The. memoir tells the tale of
an unusual life, one of ups and
downs, but the downs are the kind
that few have the courage to reveal
to the public.

Lucas might seem positive
about these events now, but it

took many years to physically and ~
- mentally overcome the trauma.

She blamed herself . for her friend’s
death because she feels she did not
speak up quickly enough, and her
distorted external image after the
car accident only worsened the
situation.

“Every time _I looked in the

mirror, I saw a monster,” she said.
“I wore big hats to cover my face .

and baggy clothes, and I just be—

“i

I now speak up for the
innocent, perhaps when I
shouldn't — I'm the person
who will run on the street and

stop a ﬁght and end up get-

ting stabbed ‘

came asocial.”

The photo .of Lucas wearing
only a handful of ﬂowers on the
cover of “It Is- What It Is” could
appear a bit risky for someone
with body image issues, but Lu-

. cas said the photo has nothing to

do with vanity. She ‘explained that
it all began with a date in which

she had to takeipictures of herself, I

in hopes that she would then see

arts & entertainment
rcomes her own death

her- beauty. It was upon seeing one
particular picture, the photo .on
the book’s cover, that Lucas re-

alized she had no reason to hide V
‘herself.

“When I looked at [the pho-
tographs], I was stunned. I didn’t

i think I was worth anything or

worthy of attention from a guy
until‘I saw that photo, it changed

Deciding eheeep 10 r

 
  

by Justin Jacobs
Ao’E E9itor

In a year when just about ev-
erything was getting worse, music
miraculously got better.

Forget about the haters who

'consistently bemoan the state of

music as, “It was better in (a year
before they were alive),” 2008 saw
some absolutely stunning releas-

CS.

That said, creating a list of the

 l0 best records of the year was not
C an easy task. Quite the contrary
— it was a stay up~all night (twice)

listening and re-listening affair. Be
warned: There were more than 10
great records this year. So with a
sad heart, -I must merely give an
honorable mention to Sky! Posi-
lizze by The Hold Steady, Oraea/ar
Spectacular by MGMT, For Emma,
Forever/lgo by Bon Iver and Bring

Lucas went into the book thinking that
her audience would at least ﬁnd excitement
in the intensity of her past and maybe be
inspired by her courage to tell the tale. .

“People have said, ‘Thank you because I .

Lucas said that her relationship with her par-
ents has suffered because they disagree with
her choice to write the book. Also, the other

people involved in the boat accident will
have to be‘reawakened to the details of that
day that they probably want to forget.

“I was taking my skeletons out of the
closet along with other people’s skeletons,
and some people didn’t want their skeletons
taken out,” she said. “I have sympathy for
the people who disagree with the book be-
cause that just means that can’t move on

“In the second half, we turned up

the defensive pressure. We pressed

Duquesne eveningrivalry With Pitt

by Pat Mitschi,
Senior Staﬂ IJV/'£ter

A  that once split Pitts-
burgh has left it lopsided in recent
history.

‘ﬁlm City Game between
Pitt and Duquesne last night at the
Piétersen Events Center was the
77th time the cross-city rivals have
met But even though the schools
are just 2.15 miles apart, the separa-
tion has. seemed much larger over
the last decade, if not longer.

Pitt has won eight straight games
against Duquesne,iincluding 27 of
the last 30, and the once—heated
 hasn’t seemed like much of
one lately. '

R But that could be 
P Duquesne, which, at one dme
won nine out ‘of 11 games against

- Pitt between 1966 and 1977, played 7

Pitt within five points in a 73-68
loss at the A.J. Palumbo Center
last year and kept last night’s game
tight through much of the first half
before the Panthers began to pull
away in the second and eventually
won handily, 78-51.

“It means a lot to me, because I

get to play down at Duquesne, too.
I’ve been watching them like I was
watching Pitt when I was young,”
said Pitt center DeJuan Blair, Pitt’s
only player from Pittsburgh. “It
means a lot to me. It’s a fun 
for the city to come out and watch
us play. We come out, there’s a little
talking. But I’m'trying to stay unde-
feated  the city.”

 

Aaron Jackson; I love that
kid. He's a classic example
of a kid getting better by
howhard he played.

Jamie _
Dixon

That might be harder now than
it would have been inyears past.
Duquesne (4-2) is 31-34 under
Ron Everhart, who is in his third

' season as coach of the Dukes. In

Everhatt’s second season last year,
Duquesne ﬁnished 17-13 —— the
school’s first  record in _14
years. There aren’t many signs of

 

regression, either.

The Dukes are led this year by
senior Aaron Jackson, a nominee
for the Bob Cousy Award, which
is given armually to college basket-
ball’s best point guard across all di-
visions.

“Aaron Jackson, I love that kid,”

said Pitt coachJarnie Dixon. “He’s a '

classic example of a kid getting bet-
ter by howhard he played.”
Jackson is the team’s only senior,
and the Dukes? other top athletes,
Damian Saunders and Bill Clark,
are both sophomores. Duquesne
also has six freshmen on its roster.
“Nobody’s going nowhere for

them, I don’t think,” said Blair. “It’s-

going to be a good rivalry from
both teams. We have goo'cl_play—
ers on both sides. It’s going to be a
tough matchup.”

Pitt wore all gold uniforms last
night _ the first time the Panthers
have worn a third jersey in the Pe-
tersen Events Center. 3

“It’s nice,” said Blair. “We didn’t

’ Pitt-Duke comparisons

Before playing No. 3 Pitt last
night, Duquesne had to travel
to play at No. 4 Duke last week.
Duquesne lost, 95-72, and Everhart
now sees why both teams are so
highly ranked, even if they differ in
playing styles. J"

“The one constant with both
teams is that they’re both very well
coached and they play extremely

with both teams the effort you get
on, every play. Duke does spend a
little more time in pressure defense, ’
and Pitt’s intensity comes when
the ball leaves somebody’s hand.
They’re ‘on the glass like nobody’s
business.” I

Pitt outrebounded Duquesne
44-31.

“It really wouldn’t be surprising
to see both of them in the Final ’
Four,” said Everhart.

Popovec had her way in the paint
in the second half, scoring 13 points
and grabbing seven rebounds.

“With every game I am getting
more experienced and more conﬁ-
dent,” said Popovec, who was 7-of-7
from the field.

Junior guard Keri Pryor led
Duquesne with 18 points in the los-
ing effort She reiterated her coach’s
comments that Pitt proved to be too
much down low _

“Second chances killed us,” said
Pryor. “All the offensive rebounds
they kept getting were our main
downf .” W

Berenato said that wins against ri-
vals like Duquesne are alwaysspecial.

the culprit is. It’s Pacman Jones, of course,
and you have to ﬁgure out where and with
whom he makes the mistake that will lead
to his lifetime ban from football. A typical
Clue suggestion would be like this: “It was
the Colonel, in the billiard room, with the
knife.” In the Pacman version, it would be
something like, “It was with Terrell Owens,
in the locker room, with a jock strap,” or, “It
