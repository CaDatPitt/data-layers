Alumni Group
Begins mive
For Members

Dierker Announces
Motto for Campaign

The annual membership Cam-
paign ofthe General Alumni asso-

ciation of the University began last
night at a banquet at the Pittsburgh
Athletic" "association. “A strong
alumni association—the index of a
great University” will be the motto
of the"present drive, states Ruth
Lee Dierker, ’21, acting secretary
of the group.

Alumni captains from the vari-
ous schools of the University were
appointed to campaign alumni of
their respective schools.

Special Rate

Seniorsare being offered a spe-
cial rate of $1 for "association mem-
bership, and draftees will be of-
fered free membership. Mrs.
Dierker states that senior men may
join by contacting the alumni of-
fice, 3632 Cathedral. Class secre-
taries are soliciting the women stu-
dents of the graduating class.

“Joining the association enables
one to become a vital part in the
growth of the University, to be a
contributor to the Alumni fund,
and to participate in alumni activi-
ties, No university can become
truly great without a strong alumni

organization,” Mrs. Dierker pointed.

out.

According to the bulletin issued
by the association, the alumni of
the University are of necessity the
only qualiﬁed witnesses able to
testify both by word and accom-
plishment to the service being ren-
dered by the University to the com-
munity. Recognition of this fun-
damental principle alone warrants
the support of the association by
each alumnus.

Fund

Primarily intended to defray ex-
penses of the association, the giv-
ing fund’s ultimate and more im-
portant purpose is to provide a

fund for the beneﬁt of the Univer-

sity to be used in the matter
deemed most desirable by the di-
rectors of the fund. As the fund.
grows to substantial ﬁgures, por-
tions may be used for badly needed
endowments, for scholarships, or
for building projects such as dormi-
tories, a student union, or a ﬁeld
house.

The bulletin continues to say that C

the opportunity provided by alumni
functions of meeting one’s fellow

alumni and of renewing old friend- '

ships and acquaintances of college
days constitutes one of the most

pleasant rewards of being part of‘

the alumni association. Home-
coming events, charter day, and re-
union dinners are all ;included on
the alumni program.

Tickets for the publications ban-

 quet will be distributed in the

Pitt News office Monday and Tues-
day from 12:30 to 3:30 o’clock. All
who plan to attend should obtain
tickets at that time. _ -.

are now available, according to Lou
Cox, BA41, chairman of the com-
mittee, who revealed that all sen-
iors may take their order blanks to

Study Deans’
Draft Letters

Quotations Concern
Studebaker Message .

Students of draft age in the Uni-
versity should study carefully quo-
tations in the letter distributed by
the board of dean’s committee on
selective service, warns Dr. Stan-
ton C. Crawford, dean of the Col-
lege, and member of the dean's
committee. ,

The letter, containing quotations
from a message received from Dr.
John W. Studebaker, US commis-
sioner of education, concerning col-
lege students enrolleduin essential
occupations, was distributed to draft
age students yesterday.

Dr. Studebaker referred to the
bulletin concerning college students
affected by the draft quoted in full
in the Pitt News on April 30.

Some of the passages referred to
by Dean Crawford include the fol-
lowing:

“I wish to say an additional word
to your students. This has to do
with the tendency of students to
enroll in short defense training
courses instead of completing their
regular college curricula.”

“The demand of industry for fully
trained professional personnel in
all the ﬁelds related to national de-
fense is already greater than the
supply and the need for these ful-
ly trained men is going to be great-
er with the passing years."

“It would be a mistake, therefore,
for a student who is competent to
complete a full college course which
is related closely to defense to drop
out of that course and complete
some short course in order to en-
gage in industrial exnployment at
less than a professional level.”, i

“The first Ao_blig'ation of college

‘ students is to fit themselves, for

the highest type of service; they
should not give up the chance to
prepare f0il' their unique service in
order to render a service on a, level
which can be rendered. by a. much
larger number of
men.”

In addition ‘to these points stress-
ed by Dr. Studebaker, the board, of
de-an’s commit-tee :-reiterated? his
warning to students, and expressed
the need for a reservoir‘ of profes-
sionalliji-t.t1~ained and skilled tech-
nicians."  '

Critic Pats Back, Clips Wings of Owl

' Shefler Reviews Yearbook

. By OSCAR. SHEFLER

Complete with wooden cover and
You, the 1941 Owl made its ap-
pearance on campus yesterday.

The book adheres closely to its
second person singular address.
When You open the book, the ﬁrst
thing you see is You.

Host Laudable

Most laudable feature. is the use
of colors. Red and blue are em-
ployed in a manner which, while
brightening the monotony of black
and white, is never too gaudy.

The high school section, featuring
pictures of a dozen city high schools,
is a yearbook innovation.

To make proper evaluation of the
book in terms of its intended pur-
pose, one must survey the pictures.
Editor Sheris has been lavish and
extravagant in his use of photo-
graphs. Some of the pictures are
too small and vague. Some of
them are “corpse" pictures. show-
ing nothing but empty rooms. Some

of them have no reason for exist-
ence.

In general, though, the pictures

are accurate and signiﬁcant. They
supplement rather than detract
from the written material. Brieﬂy,

they are good pictures, in subject
matter and in presentation.

In reading the organization
writeups. one gets the feeling that
there is too damn much informal-
ity. There is too much ﬂabby
wordiness. going nowhere in par-
ticular and being without the sav-
ing grace of good exposition. There
is too much devil-may-care luxury
of wordage for a senior yearbook
in a statement such as,

“From acorns, oaks from pennies.

a Cathedral; from monthly MC
luncheons, service! For as Head
Councilman Don Parke’s salad

diminishes. so unfold plans of ten-
tative projects."

The gall of that exclamation
point!

Hitherto ignored departments
have received special attention.

The engineers are admirably pre-
sented in six pages. The military
department, in its business and so-
cial sides, is fully covered.

Dances

From the standpoint of complete
reporting, appropriateness of pho-
tography, and neatness of makeup.
the best feature of the Owl is the
section covering the year’s big
dances. Here the writing is indi-
cative of what Sheris may have
been striving for, an intelligent in-
formality with a leavening of so-
phistication.

In the sports section, the recap-
itulation of the last football season
is real college yearbook. It is in-

, tended to bring back salient mem-

ories of the gridiron season. This

it accomplishes.

The elaborate ceiling is now‘

nearing" completion. I It consists of
30 squares each containing a sun
of gold foil on a blue background.
The gold foil was ﬁrst put on the
plaster, and then the blue. back-
ground was painted around it out-
lining the sun and its rays.

A design of the square and oblong
variety has been etched as a border
between the walls and the ceiling.
Coupled with this border is an-
other one, an egg and dart draw-
ing, done in blue and gold.

At the side of the room opposite
the door, stand two corinthian and
two ionic crowned pillars of mar-
ble. Their decorations will be in
red, blue, green, and a prominence
of gold in order to bring out all the
minute details worked out in the
marble.

As a frame for the door, there is
a marble entrance brought over
from Greece. Kokotsis pointed out
that all of the designs on the mar-
ble are hand-made.

Each part of small Greece and
each of the many little Grecian
islands contributed toward this
room for the Cathedral. As a
tribute to their cooperation, each
chair in the room will be inscribed
with the name of some section of
Greece.

Dr. Wrilliams Suffers
From Jungle Malady

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, professor
of biology and zoology, is in a seri-
ous condition in the Eye and Ear
hospital with a recurrence of a
jungle malady which he contracted
several years ago on a trip into the
jungles of Haiti, the biology depart-
ment announces.

Long known as the unofficial
“goodwill ambassador of the Uni-
versity." Dr. Williams has been at
Pitt for ﬁfteen years and is a mem-
ber of ODK, Collembolae, and Sig-
ma Xi, honorary science frater-
nity. He has often served as judge
of sweepstakes meets and of the in-
terfraternity sings.

Seniors who plan to enter the

dean of the Law school, beginning
next week.

Ruth IVilliamson, Pitt Student,
Is Teacher, Author in Egypt

Ruth Williamson, school of Edu-
cation senior who speaks Arabic flu-
ently, has been caught by the war.

Miss Williamson, who has spent
ﬁfteen years in Egypt is trying in
vain to obtain her visa for readmis-
sion to that country. The State De-
partment refuses to grant any visas
fo“ Egypt because it is a belligerent
area.

As a kindergarten teacher in the
African country for many years.
Miss Williamson learned ﬁrst—hand
of the need for story books and
primers in the schools there. So
she compiled and published two
books in Arabic.

One of her books consists of 50
selected short stories for children
and several illustrations. The other
is a primer. The books are bound
on the right rather than on the left
as English books are. The Arabic
language, she explains. is read back-
wards from left to right.

The books, printed in 1930 when
she returned to the United States
for afew months. are new.‘ standard

primary texts in Egypt. Only 1,000
copies have been printed but this is
because of the small precentage of
literate population, Miss William-
son explains. Literacy among the
Egyptians. is only one per cent, she
remarlszed.

Recalled in 1938 by the Ameri-
can Mission of the United Presby-
terian church. when trouble in
Egypt was ﬁrst suspected, Miss Wil-
liamson has since been taking class-
es to earn her AB degree.

Although this is her senior year
at the University, Miss Williamson
is taking a full course sched-
ule for the first time. She attained
senior standiiig. however, by at-
tending several summer sessions at
the University. She is majoring in
elementary education. ‘

Now that she has just about com-
pleted formal education for her de-
gree, Miss Williamson plans to take
graduate work and patiently wait
for the trouble to clear up. When
she gets her visa. she will return to
Egypt to continue I‘.?l‘ missionary
work.

A Plan for a New Use
Of Old Texbooks

We attended a dinner a couple of nights ago
at which an American-Chinese student spoke.

Since the invasion of their country by the
Japanese, the Chinese college students have had
to move their colleges to the West. They picked
up what clothes they had, packed what books
and lab instruments they could car.cy,pand~ by
boat, truck, and foot they traveled West nd
South, 800 rpiles to Chungking,  1600 miles
to Chengtu. " ' ' A ‘

China needsmoney, we know. But most of
us do not know that :she needs. textboo _ also.
The American-Chinese student who spokeat the

dinner those couple of _nights_ag.p said that he.
had seen a” student working -dut prob,leni’s"'on’
the ground with a. stick because he» hadtno‘ -

paper. And he knew another boy who trans-
ferredonly the most precious ‘of notes on -the
back of an envelope he had saved.

Thepaverage Pitt student has two or three 0

old unused textbooks at home, books that he
knows he will never manage to sell, booksthat
will eventually get thrown out. Psychology,
mechanical drawing, calculus
Fraternitiesusually have a library of used

textbooks for their members; and in this library a

are many texts that have been dropped from
courses. English, philosophy, geometry . .

Men’s council has stored up in a closet a
couple of hundred books that have not_ been‘
A sold, that ‘may not ever be sold, that could be

sent to China and be useful. Geology, history,
Physics, ROTC manuals.

In a purely‘ unofﬁcial capacity we ask the
average Pitt student to put his textbooks back
to work. Those who have a couple at home can
bring them into the News office sometime in
the next two weeks.

Fraternity men can have pledges dust off the
unused books in their libraries and cart them
up to the eighth ﬂoor.

Anyone who has a red claim slip on a book
that never got exchanged in the Men’s council
book exchange can present it to us and we’ll
cash it in on the text.

We promise that the books will get to Chinese
college students, even if we have to take them
ourselves.

The Owl Seems Just
 Little Incomplete

We sa-w an Owl the other day. But «there
was something incomplete about it; something
was missing. That something, we discovered
after checking through the book again, was a
section devoted to the medical school and one
to the law school.

In previous years the School of Medicine has
been included in the book, in the senior section

and inithe other pages, but this year med school

seniors vote'd not to appear in the Owl.

And law students have not been a part of '

the Owl for many years. . I

-Although they are Graduate schools, Schools
of Law and Medicine are parts of the University’.
The_ir',senio_rs' are numbered among the 1300 men
and women who. will receive degrees at Com-
mencement.‘ I I ,

"Yet: to‘ the outsider glancing. through the
pagesyof ':thef1941 Owl there is nolmention of
either, other than brief notes onthe deans of
the two "schools.

To us a complete yearbook meansuthe repre-
sentation of every school in the University.

This is the end.

It is spring, the season for dozing in the afternoon,
fragrant blossoms, new clothes. It is the perfect time
to say goodbye to four years of specialized study and
intense growing.

It is the perfect time to say goodbye to the pro-
fessors who still tall: to us. No doubt we’ll see them
again, but it won’t be the same. It is the perfect time
to say goodbye to fraternity brothers and classmates.
It is the perfect time for our fraternity bill to cease.
Oh, how we know this!

It is the perfect time to shake hands and call off all
arguments with fellow space-ﬁller Bob Hamilton; to
tell Bill McElwain he’s a right guy and not to take
things too seriously; to thank Anita Barone for her
smile; to slap Ossy Sheﬂer on the back and tell him
to keep on writing and writing; to tell Gene Pyle, Beth
Hughes, Murelle Russell, Roy Ruane and Jack deBene-
dictis it’s been a pleasure.

It is spring, the season for seniors to ask for inter-
views, for watching the call of draft numbers, for
wondering where and how we’ll ﬁt into this malad-
justed world.

It isn’t important that the economics and ethics
we’ve been taught have been blitzed. It isn’t import-
ant that we made this honorary and didn’t make that
one. Life itself is not now important.

It is important only that we met and knew and
hobnobbed with some thoroughbreds—teachers and
students. No matter what happens from here on out,
life has been good and can never now be wasted.

No more in heaven or on earth.

This is the end. "

crazy at ﬁrst, and then switched to the viewpoint that
it was treason not to vote Democratic. The hill folks
used to hold what they called “grubbin’ frolics,” which
I gather was a sort of stump-clearing-out spree. and
when they got tired they’d rest under a tree for awhile
and argue politics. It wouldn’t have been an. argu-
ment except for Pop, and the other boys tried to
make him see the error of his ways by booting him in
the likeliest spot every time he’d lean over to pick
upsomething, and shout—“A vote for Douglas, you ole

» Republican!” -

Long Live the Patriarch
Pop’s a bit over eighty now and the healthiest guy
He can outwalk any of us, and I
wouldn’t be surprised if he outlived the bunch of us.
He likes to ride in the back seat of cars and sing
mountain songs. Here’s a couple of his favorites.
One goes-—
When a fellow falls in love
With his little turtle dove
He will linger all about her under jaw.
He will kiss her for her mother,
Her sister and her brother
Till her daddy comes and kicks him from the door.
Then he draws a pistol from his pocket
Pulls the hammer for to cock it
And vows he’l1 blow away his giddy brains.
His ducky says he must.n’t,
’Tisn’t loaded, so he doesn’t
Now they're kissing one another once again.

But my favorite of them all is this one-—
When I was young and in my prime
I was chasing the gals most all the time
I'd take one out each day for a ride
And I always had one by my side
I’d hug and kiss them just for fun
And I haven’t forgot the way ’tis done
So if any girl here’s in love with me
She'll find me as young as I used to be.
And I think she would, too.

malarkey, few anecdotes,

Oscar Sheﬂer

I have ‘worked for the News because of the many
friendships I have made in doing so. I have felt that
it was myduty to contribute something to the student

All that is so much malarkey, I have worked for
the News because I like to see my writing in- print.
Bylines are unimportant because" no one else writes
as I do. But I like the idea that somelten thousand
people ‘are reading what I have written. A

My nostalgia I amsaving for commencement night,

tankloads of ocular brine and sentimental slush. I

t . am sorry -to leave; there are very few things I would

not do to be able to come back. Further than that I
will not ‘commit myself. ' - . "
My attitude,“ since I was a freshman, has been an
unusual one. When I went to Middlesex countyjunior
college, ‘I met a gbod many college graduates. All of
them had anecdotes to tell about their undergraduate
days. So I said to myself, “Sheﬂer, you must remem-
ber to compile anecdotes.” A
This I did. Never did I go drinking just for the
pleasure of good fellowship. When I entered any ac-
tivity, it was not with the idea in mind that I was to
make myself a cog. Not I. I made anecdotes. I set
fire to the Foster memorial curtain. I put the head
of an unborn baby in my psychology professor’s coat
pocket. I slashed my wrists in. the elevators, coating
new spring outﬁts with a pale grayish. sort of blood.

‘ Time after time, I walked advertently into ladies‘

rooms.

Now I can tell anecdotes. They are very vitaliz-
ing. People who once were lethargic and listless now
wake up when they hear my anecdotes and run
screaming from the room.

A word for the underdogs. Take the top stone out
of the Cathedral and nothing happens. Take the bot-
tom stone out and the whole structure collapses.
(That’s another anecdote I must tell some time.) Too
little credit goes to the behind-the—scenes men——our
anti-poll tax editor, Heine Mellon, Bill Clugston, Rugy
Aldisert (sterling copy boy of the Panther).

I have no antipathy towards the men of Tech. I
think their senior class should be voted most likely to
succeed the Royal Oak party.

As for the women at Pitt, I have found them to be
interesting and amusing. I have found them to be in-
telligent. I have found them to be beautiful. Most
important, I have found them.

Over-the—desk writing is the most important thing
that has happened to me in my senior year. It is
fascinating that no matter how many editor’s notes we
write, no one ever understands how it is done. All we
do is write notes to each other, then print them_
(Editor’s note: Sheﬂer, this simplicity of style has got
to stop. If you can?t make things complex and mud-
dled and mystic. there’s no room for you on the News,)

about the banquet "and I always

The rest‘ of the room was taken
up by a long table and heavy chairs

carved from“ teak or mahogany. On ‘

the walls hung pa-intingsof Chinese
scenery, bird tapestries, ‘and pieces
of red paper covered with Chinese
characters, good luck charms I was
told. .

The scene was set, so 'was the
table, so we sat down and ate.

First on the menu was .'bird’s nest
soup. You ain’t lived till! you’ve
eaten bird's nest soup. I’m won-
dering if-. anyone besides me lived
after eating it. It really wasn't bad,
though -with a delicate ﬂavor to suit
our delicate stomachs. It was ﬂeck-
ed with little bits of ham, and tast-
ed like eating a ham sandwich and
a bowl of celery soup at the same
time, almost.

Sub gum was next. That’s rice
with vegetables and almond hearts.
I found a sauce which was made
of gin, I was told. I’m not certain
if that’s a Chinese word or not, but
I ate lots of it on my rice.

The piece de resistance was
something I don’t know the name
of. It was a dish piled high with
shrimp, chopped rubber bands
(that's what it looked like), Chi-
nese cabbage, gluey stuff in strands
like spaghetti, and some kind of
meat. I asked my Chinese friend
what kind of meat it was and he
said “hog.” That may be its Chi-
nese name, but I gathered it was
pork and restricted myself to it,
since I’m allergic to shrimp. I think
the rubber bands were chopped
squid or little oysters not on the
half shell.

The new order that will come
with the “cessation of hostilities”
of World War II will need a new
Bible. Following are some of its
probable verses designed to be read
by our great-great grandchildren.
May they be born to read them.

And then the squeamish Hess
ﬂew in a l\/Iesserschmitt to his pur-
gatory.

‘And Rhodomanthus Churchill
rose up and bowed the House of
Commons in prayer for the death
of 10,000 Children of Israel which
Hess had not remembered to con-
done. , ,

And_Rudolph’s soul no longer in-
fected his body but was wiped
clean and healed in return for sec-
ret information.

And it came to pass that in the
days of new economic upheavals in
the lands of Europe more and more
Hesses became squeamish, stole
Messerschmitts and found the Eng-
lish purgatory.

And the House of Commons was
bowed many more times for those
dead Children of Israel over-
physiced with a national socialism.

And then the peoples in the Land
of the Free began to cry out in
Christian fervor against such
treachery to Jesus’ original sheep.
They called out to Rhodomanthus
to send these Teutons to America
to taste a lynching rope long stale
from His black sheep.

lBut Rhodomanthus said no and
promised the head of Saint Adolph
to be cut off by the dancing Frank-
lin Nightingale and placed on a
platter wrought of gold and na-
tional minorities to be delivered
when the time should come to
pass for the second Fourteen
Points and brotherly love.

And the people in the Land of
the Free were paciﬁed and cried out
no m-ore for Hesses in the name of
Jesus, but bided their time with
convoys of armaments and awaited
the head of Saint Adolph.

But the Libyan hosts became
hard-pressed by the fair Teuton
youths who were not yet Hesses
and still s-panzered round with Jew-
ish Shekels.

So Franklin called upon his peo-
ple to rise up and help him strike
the fetid head of Saint Adolph from
his shoulders. This was done with
youths also conscripted and as fair
as the Teutons, and the head fell
bleeding from the German should-
ers.

And so it came to pass that the
second Fourteen Points were pro-
posed, and the second Versailles
peace was completed, and the earth
was prepared for another cycle.-

Competition doesn’t ﬁgure to be
too strenuous for Regis Larkin in
the 440. The phenomenal climb of
this senior from relative obscurity
to a leading position on the squad
is the toast of the track. None of
the Army men should come near
him in his specialty.

Cosgrove to Lead
Swimming Squad

Pitt’s 1942 swimming team will
be captained by Herb Cosgrove.
Members of the varsity aquatic
squad chose the popular breast-
stroker at their annual meeting last
Wednesday.

Cosgrove is the current Eastern
Collegiate breaststroke champion,
a title that he won and has held
since his ﬁrst year on the varsity
squad. The new captain was a
deﬁnite contributing factor in the
Panther championship drive of last
year.

Cosgrove was the team’s most
consistent winner in the season just
ended. Not only did he gain many
points in his breaststroke specialty,
but always gave a good account of
himself in both the 220 and 440-
yard free style races, whenever
called upon.

Phi Eps Lead

Rivals in Greek Mushball Race

Winding up the closest race in
the history of fraternity mushball,
the league leaders, Phi Gamma
Delta, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Phi Kap-
pa, will take their last’ stand this
the 1941
champions.

Each of -the leading teams boast
identical records of 7 wins ‘against
one defeat, and each must win their
remaining contests to pull through

"with the title. Double bills will

be quite frequent this weekend for
Spring Festival week’s delay and

:an overcrowded schedule makes it
' imperative.

Colvin To Hurl

The Phi Gains, defending title-
holders, meet the Phi Delts in a
breather today, then tackle the Phi
Eps and the Pilams in Saturday con-
tests.

Against the Phi Delts, the Fijis
should record number 8 on the list
of victories. Then the next morn-
ing at 10 o’clock a dark horse Pilam
team might upset the dope. If the
Phi Gains come through as predict-
ed, the Phi Ep battle in the after-
noon will probably be the deciding
factor in the IF race.

The Phi Gamma Delta squad this
year has an unusual quantity of
power, but lack ﬁnesse on the de-
fense. Bill Colvin will probably
hurl two of the three tilts. while

facing Cox, Phi Delt, Faberman.
Pilam, and Silverberg, Phi Epsi-
lon Pi.

Biron Leads Catchers

Phi Epsilon Pi’s team has the
hardest hurdle of the three for they
meet the second place Pi Kappa
Alpha team today at 7 o’clock, then
go on to meet the Phi Gams on Sat-
urday afternoon. Captain Marty
Rosenstock has proven himself to
be one of the standout second base-
man’s of the league thus far this
season as his hitting in the number
five slot has helped his team to
many victories. Joe Coplin, veter-
an left ﬁelder, Arny Biron, sturdy
catcher, and pitcher Jay Silverberg
will carry the Phi Ep hopes today
and tomorrow.

Sotack Gets Credit

Phi Kappa played the majority
of their games last Wednesday and
Thursday, and have nothing to do
this weekend but wait and pray.
Mike Sotack pitched the Phi Kaps
to their present high perch, and de-
serves most of the credit.

’ “‘-Sotack also adding -quite a bit to

the hitting department of the team

with his timely homers. Frank

Dax. Bobby Tyberski, and Ray
Prushnok supply the Phi Kaps with
a commendable battin-g combina-
tion.

The Phi Kaps lost their opening
tilt on a forfeit and have not since
been beaten.

The awards to the winning golf-

17th floor in the Cathedral.

Varsity Trips Pr0fsA gain, 3-0;
Faculty Nine Hits Ballllard-ly

Its happened again. The varsity
defeated the faculty in what was
jokingly referred to as a baseball
game, last Tuesday at the Stadium.
But there was something different
about this year’s encounter.

The Pitt professors ﬁnally solved
varsity pitching. When the totals
were taken, it was discovered that
they pounded the Mitterling
moundsmen for exactly one hit. The
luckless faculty fellow, who today
ﬁnds himself a virtual outcast. shun-
ned and snickered at, is Herbert
Cummings of the Business Admin-
istration school.

Through tear-ﬁlled eyes and with
sobs that literally shook his care-
strained body, Cummings said to-
day, “I I just don't know
what made me do it.”

And to add insult to injury, the
Philadelphia Athletics were re-
ported to have offered the foriiier
boxer a contract for the duration of
the season.

Potts Snags Fly

It was agreed upon (by the fac-
ulty) before the game to force the
varsity men to use stringless tennis
racquets in place of the customary
bat. At this point, it may be well
to mention that freshman grid coach
Nick Kliskey, who was the middle
man in the various transactions be-

tween. home plate and the outﬁeld
for the Panther batters, had seven
strikeouts to his credit. But Nick
was also nicked for seven safeties.

Hero of the fracas was Intra-
mural Director James Potts. While
standing around in the outﬁeld ad-
miring the vast emptiness of the
85,000 Stadium seats, he happened
to catch one of the many ﬂy balls
that came in his direction, while it
was still in the air. But it only
happened once.

As for the activities of the facul-
ty outﬁelders in general, they were
chasing the ball so often, that Coach
Carl Olsen, who was drilling his
track men, accidently clocked one
of the outiielders for the half-mile
sprint.

Daddio Plays to Crowd

Bill Daddio was guilty of a bit
of grandstanding in the seventh in-
iiing. He caught a high pop ﬂy at
his ﬁrst base post, made it look like
a tough try by going into a back-
ward somersault, got up, bowed to
the plaudits of the multitude, and
then was painfully helped to the
bench.

tringless tennis racquets not-
withstanding, the varsity baseball-
ers won by a 3 to 0 count. But to
quote and unquote faculty Feller.
Nick Kliskey, “Just wait till next
year."

Panther Nine Leaves Today to Face
Powerful Middie Team at Annapolis

. By JOHN CHAFFO

Two of the best baseball teams in
the country will meet tomorrow
afternoon when the sensational

University of Pittsburgh team meets
an equally brilliant Navy nine -at
Annapolis. ,

Both squads will boast enviable
records when they take the ﬁeld to-
morrow afternoon, The Panthers
will be after their seventh straight
win and ninth out of eleven starts.
while the- Middies are after win
number thirteen. '

Pitt will call upon sophomore
liurler Bob Malloy to handcuff the
hard hitting Midshipmen and record
victory number nine. The Panther
righthander has scored -ﬁve wins
this season without once feeling the
effect, of defeat. Should ‘Malloy
begin to falter, Coach Mittelfling will
call upon footballei',Eddi€ Jones for
relief. ’  

Navy will boast their strongest
team in the last several yeai's and
should enter the game with the
Pantheis at nothir.-g’ less than an
even bet. The Middies are said to
have one of the best defensive units
in the East as well as a hard-hitting
line-up.

Mitterling vs Bishop

In games thus far this season,
the Navy squad has completely out-
played practically all the teams
which they have met. Only four
schools have been able to setback
the fast moving Middies while
twelve have felt the sting of the
highly vaunted Navy attack.

An interesting sidelight
game tomorrow is the somewhat
personal rivalry between Panther
mentor Ralph Mitterling and Navy
coach Max Bishop. Both men
played for the Philadelphia Ath-
leti.cs in their prime and both are
rated as tops in collegiate baseball
circles.

The University of Pittsburgh and
Navy will each rely chieﬂy upon
tight pitching plus a better than
average defense to carry them to
victory. One thing that should give
a slight edge if any to the Panthers
is the presence of two outstanding
pitchers on the Pitt team plus an
efficient double play combination.

in the

Nittany Lions Next Opponent

The Blue and Gold has displayed
plenty of defensive speed in their
previous games this season in roll-
ing up a number of double plays.
Against the Mountaineers from
West Virginia, Pitt clicked off two
with plenty of time to spare.

Coach Mitterling will start the
same team against the Middies that
trounced the Penn State nine. The
‘power for the Pitt nine will again
come from the potent bats of
catcher Guy Guadagnino, third

Dancing Ranks First
Among Recreations
By STUDENT OPINION SURVEYS

AUSTIN. Texas, May 23. —-— In
practically every sectfon of the na-
tion the favorite dance orchestra of
the American college student is
Glenn Miller’s.

Student Opinion Surveys of
America, leaving aside political, so-
cial, and economic questions that
today bother the world and the col-
legian, has turned to the ﬁeld of
college recreation, and in a nation-
wide poll ﬁnds:

FAVORITE RECREATIONS

AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS:

1. Dancing

2. Swimming
3. Tennis.

4. ‘Reading

FAVORITE DANCE ORCHESTRAS

1. Glenn Miller

2. Kay Kyser

3. Tommy Dorsey

4 Guy Lombardo

5. Wayne King (tie)

The Miller band tops all others,
polling twice as many ballots ‘as
any other one orchestra. His music
is sought by nearly one-fourth of
all students.

Kyser was a favorite in the South-
ern states, with Miller‘ a close sec-
ond. ‘

While dancing is one thing that
most eds and co-eds would ratlier
do when away from the classroom,
swimming is" not as great a favor-
its with women as it is with men.
Second choice of the women was
tennis. “Bridge was among the least
popular ‘of recreations. Among the
most unusual mentioned werebeer
drinking‘,; writing, ﬂying, sleeping.
singing, eating, and——yes, studying.

Daughter of Polish Consul Contrasts Life
In lfuitetl States with Europe 93 Censorshipi

That. Nina Szt-ark, daughter of
the Polish Consul to Pittsburgh is
a realist. is demonstrated by the
way she. writes to her iriends in
Europe. "I never seal my letters to
home anymore,” she smiled wryly.
“I simply tuck the ﬂap in. Then
the censors don’t have to bother rip-
ping my envelopes up.

The small, dark Polish girl is now
working as secretaryto Ruth Craw-
ford Mitchell, advisor to the Nation-
ality Rooms, but" she has traveled
all over Europe.

“Your people don’t appreciate
what they have in this country, and
it infuriates me,” she declared in
her oﬁice the other day. “I just
wish some of them could be shipped
to Italy or Germany for two or three
weeks, and then they would know
what they have here,” she cried.

“But I do like you

friendl’ness, and kindness. and that
almost brotherly feeling you all

seem to me to have here," she
amended. We have more good
neighborliness here than in any

other country in the world, Miss
Sztark said.

Another nice thing‘ about Amer-
ica, according to Miss Sztark, is
the way our wealthy people work.
“All your rich people seem to do
something here,” she said admir-
ingly. "There is nothing like that
in Europe—of course, we don’t have
so many rich people there,” she
laughed, “but even if we did, they
probably wouldn’t work.”

Miss Sztark has 21 married sister
in Poland. It is through her let-
ers that the family learns about the
tremendous food shortage Europe
is having. Miss Sztark’s niece re-
cently had a birthday in Warsaw,
and received a very rare and expen-
sive gift. It was an orange, and
two pounds of apples.
