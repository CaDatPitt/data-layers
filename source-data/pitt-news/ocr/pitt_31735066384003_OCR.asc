Student Coalition‘ Slates
Budget Crisis Workshop

YMARKMURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Student leaders from Pitt and
Penn State, working toward the
settlement of Pennsylvania's state-
related colleges’ ﬁnancial crisis,
met for the second time this week in
an effort to ﬁnalize cooperative
strategy between the schools.

Representative from Temple
University and Lincoln University,
Pennsylvania’s other state-related
colleges, failed to attend the series
of meetings held this past Sunday
and Monday. Both schools report-
edly are suffering from internal
squabblings, principly between

their student governments and

administrations.

The Pitt and Penn State groups,
which is not ofﬁcially titled but
includes student government lead-
ers from both schools, set a date for
an educational workshop to be held
at Pitt,_ made plans to travel to
Philadelphia this weekend for more
meetings and adopted a campaign
slogan designed to unite public
opinion ‘on the plight of the
state-related universities.

The slogan, “Invest in the

 Future. Support Higher Educa-

9!

tion, was proposed by the Penn
State contingent and agreed to by
the other schools. This is an
important detail, according to Pitt
Student Government Board (SGB)
member Dave Hesidence.

‘ ‘The slogan is meant to present a
solidiﬁed image to the public,”
Hesidence said. “All four schools

will use the slogan. Weare now in
the process of having name tags
printed with the slogan.”

A workshop designed to educate
students on how they can help in the
appropriations ﬁght, will be held
Oct. 7 in the Student Union lower
lounge. Legislators have been
invited to speak and will be asked to
present raw ﬁnancial data in
layman’s terms.

The group will meet again this
weekend in Philadephia, joined for
the first time by‘ students from
Temple and Lincoln. Hesidence and
fellow SGB members Chip Hubbard
and president Bernie Payne will
represent Pitt at that conference.

~ The funds needed to pay the costs of

transporting the three to Philadel-
phia are available because monies
set aside to pay for a SGB trip to
Penn State last week were never
used.

RSA Members Elect Officers

Phil Cillo was elected chairman of

Colleges Deny Black

Admission

x0_With the Supreme Court set to
"‘ near a landmark

“reverse dis-
crimination” case, Pennsylvania
college officials deny setting quotas
to insure admission of black
students.

But they acknowledge that race
might be a factor in deciding who
gets into professional schools.

Although many Pennsylvania
colleges have special minority
recruitment programs, officials say
they do not use quotas to reserve
class space for blacks and other

‘  4‘ Qminorities.
 ' “When I took this job no one

ever said anything about quotas,”
said Roosevelt Green, in charge of
minority recruitement for Penn
State’s numerous graduate and
professional programs.

‘‘I personally have made it clear
that we can’t get into the head count
and numbers game,” Green added.

The nationwide controversy over
reverse discrimination centers on a
case ﬁled by Allan Bakke, who says
he was denied admission to the
medical school of the University of
California because of his race.

,M, ,1}, Bakke charges that the university
‘S  admitted

less qualiﬁed blacks
through a quota system which
reserved spaces for them. The
California Supreme Court upheld
Bakke and the university appealed.

Pennsylvania college admissions V

officials are uncertain what the
impact of the Bakke case will be in
the state, but they say the large
number of applicants to profes-

sional schools often means that
academically qualified students are
denied admission.

chairman and Terry Weis (junior,
Holland) was chosen as the new
treasurer.

Ann Pinckney last year served as
both vice-chairman and secretary;
Jim McCaffrey was treasurer.

Election for the ofﬁce of secretary
was delayed until the next meeting,
and Pinckney will continue her
duties as acting secretary until that
time.

Cillo was active last year as a
member of the Towers A Hall
Council and was instrumental in the
creation of the RSA Blood Drive last
year. As chairman, he said he hopes
to‘work with the IFC in organizing
student activities. '

“I have already talked to Larry

Lunsfofd, the new Greek advisor, ‘

and we’re both very enthusiastic
about working together and helping
to program a tremendous amount of
activities for the University,” Cillo
said.

In other business, the RSA voted
on funding policy for the current
school year and the second annual
Blood Drive was tentatively sched-
uled for the end of October——begin-
ning of November. Also discussed
was the possibility of Homecoming
ﬂoats to represent resident balls.

The RSA Board is comprised of 10
board members and feur officers,
representing Pitt dorms and
students housed at Webster Hotel
and Carlow College.

Gaucher’s Disease is charac-
terized by the accumulation of
beta-glucocerebroside, a com-
pound of sugar and fatty
substances which is a normal
component of cell membranes. It
is normally released when old
blood cells are broken down in the
spleen. But in victims of Gaucher’s
Disease, the enzyme which

eliminates the fatty buildup is  I

missing or inactive.

This deﬁciency results in an
enlarged spleen, which can cause
great discomfort and destroy an
excessive number of red blood
cells and platelets, causing anemia
and bleeding. Surgical removal of
the spleen has been found to be an
effective treatment for such blood
disorders.

GOV. ASKS KENT STATE
CHARGE DISMISSAL

CINCINNATI (AP)—Ohio Gov.
James Rhodes had asked a federal
appeals court to dismiss claims
against him in connection with the
deaths of four students during a
1970 antiwar rally at Kent State
University.

“There is no evidence that
Governor Rhodes misued any of his
powers. Rather, uncontroverted

evidence clearly indicates he

properly exercised his powers,’-’
attorneys for Rhodes argueds in an
appeal ﬁled Monday with the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

A three-judge panel of the
appellate court last month ordered a
new trial for Rhodes and other state
ofﬁcials and National Guardsmen
named in a $46 million damage suit.
They had been cleared of ﬁnancial
liability in an earlier trial in U.S.
District Court.

In asking for the full appeals
courts to rehear the case, and
uphold ‘the district court, the
Governor. argued that the “only
conceivable -basis for liability”
against him was that he was
governor of Ohio.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Back to Basics

Pitt’s admission standards, eroded over the past few years by
economic necessity, have created a problem for College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Robert Marshall: How to arm educationally lacking
students with the academic tools they’ll need at Pitt.

Finding the desired participants is relatively easy: low Scholastic

P Aptitude Test scores usually identify a student whose education

leaves him behind most of his classmates. giving that student an
opportunity to improve himself in a dignified manner, however,

can be a problem.

But not an insurmountable one, it

appears, at Pitt, given recent

efforts by Marshall -and two assistant professors, Dave
Bartholomae and Anthony Petrosky.

Bartholomae, an English instructor, and Petrosky, who field is
language communications, devised .a six-credit course that
combines basic reading and writing instruction and that could aid

the 75 volunteer enrollees tremendously.

Too many students emerge from high school English classes that
emphasized interesting discussions and ignored the basics of
grammar, spelling and reading. The result is painfully obvious in

each basic writing class on campus.
program focuses on

But CAS’

the skills of reading

comprehension and effective writing that are necessary weapons in

the battle of education.

The increasingly severe paradox between some of Pitt’s high
academic goals and its declining admission standards is one that
will have to be considered by the University soon, but CAS and the
new program’s. innovators are to be congratulated for making that
division a bit more bearable for all concerned.

Two Feet by Three Feet Can Mean Death

Two feet by three feet by ﬁve
inches may mean death, if you're
driving your motorbike, or even
your small whelled automobile on
the streets of Pittsburgh.

Mayor Caliguiri told us he’d see
that the pot hole capital of the world
would lose it infamous name.

Maybe he will. But some of us
doubt it. It is true that some of the

pots are being ﬁlled, but it is also

true that there are some very
dangerous holes still remaining.
Exempli grati; on Forbes Ave. in
front of David Lawrence Hall, there
is a pothole that measures 2 feet by
3 feet by_S inches, one side of which
is the old covered street car track.
This sharp, straight edge could
possibly cut a tire and cause the
vehicle to swerve into another
vehicle. The fact that it is sheer and
supported by a depression in the
road surface could also cause a
vehicle to swerve and its driver to
lose control. That is what seems to
have happened last Friday at
approximately 4 p.m. when 21-year-
old Gary Guardalabene was driving

his 1948 Harley-Davidson motor-
cycle past the David Lawrence Hall.

‘ Gary is now in Presbyterian
University Hospital, reportedly
suffering from arm, leg, and rib and
internal injuries. . He was thrown
approximately 12 feet and landed on
the street surface.

Thecombined efforts of citizens,
university police, city police, city
ﬁre department medic.5 and Rescue
1 were put into play to see that Gary
received aid as quickly as possbile
and to reduce any further suffering.
University police ofﬁcers Fritz
LaBarge and Frank Manning
quickly determined the injuries
were extensive enough to warrant
Medic 5 delivering Gary to the
hospital rather than Rescue 1. The
ﬁne service provided by Pittsburgh
Emergency Medical Services-
Medic 5 unit are to be commended.
They are not unlike TV’s “Emer-
gency,” on the job when needed.
Thank you.

This accident need not have
happened if Mr. Caliguiri’s road
crew had gotten on the job sooner.

This pothole and the one approxi-
mately thirty feet away have existgfff.
for a long time; there is no excuse t3’
justify their continued existence.
Will we need to send another person
to the hospital or the cemetary
before somebody ﬁlls it, Mr.
Caliguiri? »

  The Bakke Case and "Too Much" Opportunity  

By GEORGE VAN HOOK,

It seems like only yeluhy. As a
matter of factlit was the year 1965
when the Johnson Administration
gave to the American public its
illegitimate child—afﬁrmative ac-
tion. It was a cute fellow, with such a
promising future. Johnson present-
ed the baby to the American people
by signing Executive Order 11246,
but many people refused to accept
him. Amidst constant attack the

.baby experienced an “anemic”

growth. This condition was brought
on by his parent’s who denied him
the proper food, shelter and
guidance. As afﬁrmative action
reached early childhood the boy was

.- put up for adoption and went from
one foster home to the next never
receiving the attention he so
desperately needed. Despite this
harsh treatment the child survived
and even though he was a weakling
a few people grew stronger as the
result of knowing him.

At this stage of his life it appeared
that afﬁrmative action would live to
be an adult. However, shortly after
his eleventh birthday he fell ill while
in California. For an entire year his
condition worsened and now

The critical blow was delivered by
Alan Bakke, a white space
engineer. Bakke, who was twice
rejected from the University of
California medical school at Davis,
sued the University on the grounds
that his 14th Amendment rights had
been violated by a special
admissions program. The program
had reserved 16 slots out of 100 for
blacks and other minorities, which
the angered Bakke claimed was
illegal and discriminatory to whites.
In a 6-1 decision the California
Supreme Court ruled in favor of
Bakke and set into motion the chain
of events which led the case to the
U.S. Supreme Court.

As the case lies before the high
court we can only speculate what
the ﬁnal decision will be. What is
not a matter of guess is the extreme
importance the ‘case holds. Obvi-
ously, a strong worded defense of
afﬁrmative action and a rejection of
Bakke’s claim will give afﬁrmative
action programs a needed shot in
the arm. A decision in favor of
Bakke will remove the legal -base of
afﬁrmative action programs and
move them rapidly down the road to
extinction.

If afﬁrmative action and special
admission program die so too will a

 

and professional opportunities
available to blacks and other
minority students, professionals
and workers who get their positions
through affirmative action pro-
grams.

Without such programs many
minority group members would be
knocking in futility on the outside of
a closed door. When we closely
examine the statistics on black
students attending large white
universities, of the six per cent total
that black students comprise, the
overwhelming majority of these
students are admitted through
special admissions programs. This
is because they don’t satisfy the
criteria for admissions, which is
normally, high SAT scores and
grades. The University of Pitts-
burgh is a case in point. Pitt has
approximately 1100 black under-
graduates, 90 per cent of which
entered the University through the
University Community Education
Program (UCEP). Many of the
UCEP students fall far below Pitt’s
admission criteria and would be
rejected under normal circumstan-
ces.

When you stop to consider the
fact that the already low standard of
education received by blacks and
other minorities is rapidly deterior-

of  i , atin (es eciall in lar e inner-ci ,

schools), it is no small wonder that
they score far below national norms.
It is also quite easy to see the
importance of special admittance
programs.

Ironically (or maybe not) as all of
the indicators point to the increased
need for afﬁrmative action special
admissions programs, these pro-

‘ grams are falling victim to the

administrative “axe”. The prevail-
ing attitude (as Bakke shows), is
that “enough” has been done for
blacks and minorities, maybe “too
much.” -

The above contention becomes
more realistic when we examine the
black student recruitment patterns
of large white universities. William
Sedlacek and Judy Pelham in a
research report entitled “Minority
Admission to Large Universities,”
state, “during the late 60’s and
early 70's there appeared to be an
increased interest and concern with
the education of black students...
however as we moved to themiddle
70's. . .the interest waned; and many
educators as well as the general
public felt that we had done enough,
if not too much for black students."

This “too much” argument is
exactly what it says, “too much, ’ ’ in
fact it is downright stupid. When
one stops to examine the weak
.f99th°..!d bJ4°k§%n.d other minorities

have in the job market ;» nd
education, the only sensible"Isg2u-
ments become “not enough.”
Whites still occupy the vast majority
of positions, especially in the higher
echelon.

In spite of the obvious truth in the
above, the myth of “too much” still
pervades the thinking of affirmative
action’s opponents. When we
couple this myth with fiscal
constrant and the general nonchal-
ant attitudes of white administra-
tors the afﬁrmative action picture
looks extremely bleak. In 
framework the importance Ox . c
Bakke decision is more
evident.

I strongly agree with those who
say afﬁrmative action programs
should be eliminated. However, I
strongly disagree on the time
schedule and method which the
anti-afﬁrmative action forces are
proposing. Bakke and his friends
are in a rush to kill afﬁrmative
action andl am willing to wait until
black and minorities have equality

SGS Cabinet Actively Seeking More Input

By MARY S. HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer
The School of General Studies
(SGS) Cabinet. elected governing
body of Pitt's night students. is

taking a more active role in the ‘

University community. according
to president John Della Valle.

“We’re becoming more inﬂuen-
tial in policies and procedures."
said Della Valle. ‘‘I think the
University and the Pittsburgh
community are finally realizing the
potential of SGS."

The Cabinet. which was elected
in March and took office in April.
consists of Della Valle and four
members: Mary Pollick. Kathy
Gubala. Bob Hilinski and Jackie
Woulitich.

Della Valle thinks the Cabinet is
off to a good start in the area of
activities.

“We're in the process of sending
out surveys to the 1.500 full-time
SGS students to see if they want
the $16 health fee option which the
part-time SGS students have.”
Della Valle said. “lfthe majority of
the students want this Health
Center service I’d be more than
happy to seek it."

According to SGS student agent
Sue Thompson. the Pine Room
“rap sessions” that began four
years ago are growing in popular-
ity. “These sessions are free social
functions available to faculty and
students." she said. “They are

The ﬁgure is the result of a
preliminary hand ‘count of registra-

“We can’t be sure about actual
numbers yet because we don’t even
have the add/drop ﬁgures. The
exact count will come from paid
accounts,” Gow said.

“We had experienced enrollment

“This year’s increase seems to be

concentrated in any particular
area, " Gow added.

These preliminary statistics were

released at a recent SGS Council
meeting.

In other business, the council

approved a proposal to adopt

“Last week Ron Alexander. our

Della Valle added. “It was the first

“This Saturday night SGS is

Park Lodge.” Thompson said.
“About 300 people are expected to
attend.

“And on October 23 we’re
holding a dinner at the Le Mont
Restaurant to honor our June
§__.gi'aduates." Della Valle said. “We
annually allocate $lS.000 for the
dinner.”

The Cabinet is also in the process
of sponsoring several services for
SGS students.

The Canal ——An Issue for Muscle Flexing

By"n. DAVID TIVE

I am ﬁnding the battle over the
Panama Canal treaty to be
fascinating. ;What l‘ﬁnd fascinat-
ing is the fact the battle is taking
place at- all, since the issues
involved in that battle are boring.

The signiﬁcance of the treaty
ﬁght goes far beyond whether we
“keep” or “lose” the Canal. The
signiﬁcance lies in the fact that the
conservative element in American
politics has chosen this as its
rallying point. the issue over which
it will make its ﬁrst concerted
attack on thecenter and left of the
American political spectrum in the
post-Nixon era. As such, it will
become the issue with which the
conservatives will be most closely
identiﬁed, and as recent U. S.
history has shown, that can make
or break their entire movement.

9 Over the past 30 years a series of
movements of various types have
risen to challenge some basic

assumptions of our society or some
basic policy of our government.
Some have succeeded and some
have failed, but all have been
colored by their initial identiﬁca-
tion, that speciﬁc issue out of their
entire program that first brought
them to national attention.

I'm not talking about long-stand-
ing movements such as organized
labor whose origins greatly pre-

date the current era of American , 
politics, or special interest activ- ‘I

ities which might be undertaken by
a group like the AMA to get a
particular policy enacted or re-
pealed. I’m talking about
broad-based movements whose
goals are to alter the way we as
Americans look at or do things.
Some examples will prove the
point.

A prime case is the ﬂﬂti-WOT!
movement of the late ’60s.
Initially, the anti-war protestors

might have been achieved much
more quickly. The initial identiﬁ-
cation of the movement in most
people’s eyes hurt*its chances of
eventual success.

The women's movement " is
another example. The current
emphasis in the drive for .s¢§_ual
equality is for ratiﬁcation of the
Equal Rights Amendment. It is
running into stiff opposition from
many quarters, only some of which
is based on the amendment itself.
Some of the opposition stems from
the original image many people
have in their minds of the women's
movement—abortion. If the
abortion battle had not been fought
before the ERA battle, prospects
for ratiﬁcation of the amendment
might be much brighter than they
are.

Both examples are ones 

which the wrong initial imagev7as
presented. In both cases the initial
image forced the movements to
ﬁght a battle other than the one
they wanted to, forced them to
ﬁght a battle out of the American
mainstream. The choice of a
radically different life style by the
anti-war movement, and of abor-
tion by the women's movement,
allowed society to isolate those
two groups, reduce their threat tc
the bulk of that society and limit
their effectiveness.

The civil rights movement made
no such mistake, choosing a
moderate line in the '50s which
enabled them to get some
landmark legislation "passed and
further their cause. By the
mid-’60s civil rights were so ﬁrmly
established that the black militant
violence of that period did not

‘ drastically hurt the movement.

It should be pointed out that
although in the three examples
given the moderate course turned
out to be the right one, it should not
be assumed that radical action is
always to be avoided. It too has a
time and place,

So where do the conservatives
and the Panama Canal, ﬁt into all
this? For the past four years the
conservative movement has been
ﬂexing its muscles. It reached a
peak last summer when it almost
dethroned an incumbent president
of the Republican party. Now the
conservatives appear ready to
make the big push to establish
themselves as a permanent nation-
al force.

Maybe they are learning from
recent history, although in general
their record on that is not too good.
Maybe they just got lucky through
President Carter’s obvious desire
to make an early mark on U. S.
foreign policy. Maybe they picked
up a cue from Ronald Reagan’s
accidental success with the Canal
issue in last summer's primaries.
Whatever the reason, conservative
leaders have made a wise decision,
from their standpoint, in choosing__
the Canal treaty as a rallying point.
It is an issue over which they
cannot be easily isolated from the
mainstream of American politics.

. It is a choice which gets them into

the public eye and does not cost
them any credibility. It is an action
which indicates that they may well
be a force to be reckoned with in
the near future.
They are doing well so far. Now if-.

they could only be right about
something for once.

Kent State

 

“Today, The Problems Are S

fEATURES\

ByDAN McKAY

[Editor’s note: This is the second
of two stories on last weekend's
protest at Kent State.] Like other
groups represented at the Kent
State rally, the Revolutionary
Student Brigade (RSB) treated the
gym question in the contest of an

 % ongoing struggle, which did not die
 after the 60’s. When the inter-

rupting ovation died, the RSB
spokesman addressed the crowd:
_“Why are they trying to smash

 the spotlight on the decade when
» E the student movement saw its finest

hour? A day, a time, when the
student movement rose up and
challenged the authorities. A time
when the student movement rose up

“Why are they trying to smash

‘the spotlight on the decade when

the student movement saw its finest
hour? _A day, a time, when the
student movement rose up and
challenged the authorities. A time
when the student movement forced

‘an end to the war in Indochina. A

time when the student movement
challenged every move. Why are
they doing it? That is the question
we have to ask ourselves!”

The spokesman paused a second
before answering this question.

“The reason why they’re doing it
is bcause whether you’re talking
about 1967, 1970 or 1977, “the
situation is the same. The problems
the people face are the same, te
directions we have to take are the
same and the nature of the enemy is
the same.”

The enemies, according to his
speech, are segregation, those who
promoted the war in Indochina,
court rulings against racial equality
such as the Bakke decision of the
Szrpreme Court, apartheid support-
 in South Africa and any
warmonger, especially those with
advanced weapons like the neutron
ii-omb and B-1 bomber.

“Call them what you want, but
most of all call them the enemy!”
the RSB spokesman exhorted to
overwhelming cheers from the
crowd. .

From a vantage point overlooking
the bulldozer tracks in the muddy
construction site, Bill Arthrell, a
graduage student, explained his
viewpoint: “One way or another,
we’re going to win. They (the
trustees) may build a gym here, but
they’re going to pay a political price

for it, and they’re going to discredit .

themselves in te eyes of the world.

They’re being insensitive to some-
thing that’s so important to so many
people that Kent State once again
has become a symbol for injustice;
not just in 1970, but again in 1977.”

Arthrell, who was an undergrad-

' uate at the time of the 1970 killings,

continued, “Legally, with bulldoz-
ers, with police, yeah, they can

* shove it (the gym) down people’s

throats, but they’re going to pay for
it in terms of political credibility and
moneis. There’s an Alumni Against
the Gym Association now. Already
a couple hundred alumni have
signed statements saying they'll
never give funds to this university
again,” he said. ' /
Looking over the muddy land that
only a week ago was a grassy
hillside, Arthrell added, “What
about the  hill! The university
destroyed 35 trees; they don’t call
that destruction. Hey, what’s a

ge 8.-THE PITT N EWS-Wednesday, September 28, 1977

manufactured piece of wire is more
important,” Arthrell said. V
Kent State University’s official
position‘ concerning the construc-
tion hardly agrees with Arthrell’s.
To the university, it is an issue of
economy and convenience.

Jim Lawless of the university's '

public information ofﬁce even
disagreed with the protesters on
what the function of the planned
building will be. “It is not a
gymnasium,” hestated. What is it,
then? Lawless explained that the
building, a part of the School of
Physical Education, Health and
Recreation, will house handball
courts, physiology classes, a
swimming pool and ofﬁces.

The reason for relocating the
building from 17.2 acres of land
bought by the university in 1968 to
the hill where, in 1970, the Ohio
National Guard mobilized prior to
killing four students and wounding.
nine others, is “Essentially for the

murdered four human beings and
shot nine others, and they’re trying
to cover it up. Ithink it’s important
to remember that the system is not a
friend to the people. If you put a
man in a uniform and give him a
gun, he’s anonymous. They’re
trained to shoot to kill!”

In another speech, a May 4th
Coalition spokesman, identified
only as Allen, summarized the order
of events that led to the gym being
constructed on its present site.

being stubborn and hard-headed,
and I think they are having a good
time. They (the administration) are
playing a game here, they are
ﬁghting their own war, and they’re
having fun.”

The long parade line started
chanting repeatedly and vocifer-
ously, “One, two, three, four.
What’re we out here ﬁghting for?
Move the gym, move the gym, move
the gym NOW!”

“Why are they trying to smash the
spotlight on the decade when the
student movement saw its finest

hour? ”

economy and for convenience,”
Lawless said.

Lawless also attested to the
sincerity of Brage Golding, the new
president of the university.
Because of Golding’s great sym-
pathy for the four slain students, he
drew up a plan for a memorial,
consisting of benches with aunings
and shrubbery. But according to
Lawless, Golding could not under-
stand why students opposed this.

The crowd around the stage could
be heard chanting again, this time,
“Long live the spirit of Kent and
Jackson State!”

Other speeches from various
factions comprising the May 4th
Coalition (including Iranian and
black groups) were‘ given in the
early afternoon before the parade
organized. .

On the fringe of the crowd walked
a bearded hulk in a chain mail suit
on top of a green robe, armed with a
large American flag on a wooden
pole. This anachronistic ﬁgure,
Rupert Chappell, observed that
“Americans shouldn't shoot other
Americans‘. America was a people’s
revolt against the system. Now
we’ve got a situation where people
are slaves to the system, and they
do all sortsof rotten things to other
people.” If we are the slaves, then
in Chappell’s scheme of things, the
masters are “money and author-
ity.”

Althoughn he wore neo-medieval
garb instead of the more common-
place black T-shirt with a red star
and a green marijuana leaf,
Chappell said he was a devout
Yippie. Asked what he believed in,
he replied, “Anarchy, freedom and
peace, and they have to go together.

“What happened here,” Chap-
pell continued, “was the system

The reason the gym is being built
on the hill, according to Allen, is ‘ ‘in
1970, that’s where the historic
confrontation took place. That’s
where thirteen people were gunned
down because they dared to stand
up against the system and fight
against the war... They’re trying to
build that gym there to cover up the

‘ crime of the Vietnam War, to make

people forget what it’s like to stand
up against the system.”

Allen ﬁnished his speech by say-
ing, “We have not backed down
here at Kent State. We have gained
many great political victories, and

- our struggle can be summed up as a
great victory that has exposed the
nature of the courts, the University,
the State of Ohio, the Federal

Government and their agents, the

police.”

The “agents” certainly were on
the scene. From strategic rooftop
positions, police shot pictures
through long, powerful telephoto
lenses. An airplane, believed to be
ﬂown by police, circumnavigated
the gray skies above the campus.
They were there, even if during the
speeches and marches they chose
lofty viewpoints.

A vote by voice was taken to
decide whether to continue the
speeches or start the march. The
latter alternative was the winner,
so the audience rose to its feet and
formed rows of eight abreast.

An undergraduate student from
Pittsburgh said, “I don’t believe in
violence, but a peaceful demonstra-
tion against this gym is the best
thing they could do.

“The gym, in my opinion, is a
cover-up, ’ ’ the ' student continued.
“They have six other sites they

could use for the gym. I personally i

think the administration is just

One woman, too old to march’
around the campus, sat alone on the
bleachers nearby with a sign in her
hands and a smile on her face. Her
hand-made cardboard sign read
“Move the Gym—Remember Kent

State!” “My spirit is .as if I was
twenty-one,” she said, in broken
English. “I’m so glad to see the

unity, because in my time they were
just ordering people against the
young people. In future they will
_stick together.”

The marchers walked off, shout-
ing over and over: “The people,
united, will never be defeated!”
Against a sky that grew grayer, the
parade snaked its way past the back
of Taylor Hall to the music and
speech building.

At this building, the ranks halted
to hear a short dedication speech in
memory of Sandy Scheuer, who was
a speech major. While the orator
spoke of the many hours Sandy
spent in this building and her love of
people, men wearing bandanas over
their faces stenciled her name in red
spray paint by the front right corner
of the building. Thus, the building
was unofﬁcially rechristened in her
memory.

The parade moved on, now
chanting “Sandy Scheuer’s spirit
lives; we’ll never forget and we’ll
never forgive!”

This scene was repeated at the
engineering and business adminis-
tration buildings. They re-christ-
ened in memory of Jeffrey Miller
and Bill Schroeder, respectively.
The same chants, with interchange-
able names, were repeated, but
along the way the marchers
shouted, “Four students dead, and

. (Governor) Rhodes goes free; that’s

what the rich call democracy! ”
They also shouted, “Join us, join
us, move that gym!” to the
onlookers. Some did.

Notably missing was a building

Pittsburgh. Her parents. unlike the

Student Health
 Service Visits Double

By ED BURKE

Student visits to Pitt’s Student
Health Service (SHS) have doubled
in the last ﬁscal year, from 18,000
in 1976 to 40,000 in 1977. The
reason. according to SHS director
Dr. Joanne Robinson. is the
mandatory health care fee of $16
per student per term.

This fall marks the second year
the mandatory fee will be in effect.
and student visits are increasing
——not because health problems are

3.-increasing, but because students

now feel they have a right to visit
the clinic for any health problem.

The SHS is an outpatient clinic
only—it makes no attempt to
hospitalize patients.’ There are ﬁve
hospitals within walking distance of
the University—“We’re sur-
rounded by hospitals... costs go up
unnecessarily when services are
duplicated.” Robinson said.

Students will be provided with a
campus pharmacy October 15. The
pharmacy, available only to stu-
dents. will be supplied by the
Graduate School of Public Health.
Cost of prescriptions drugs will be
lower for students because of this
SHS service.

The SHS organization resembles
a co-operative. owned and operated
by students‘. “No one who needs
care is turned away,” said
Robinson. Part-time students can
either pay the mandatory fee each
term or pay for medcical- attention
at each clinic visit.

SHS offers cholera inoculations;
all other_inoculations are offered
free of charge at the Allegheny
County Health Department office
at McKee Place and Forbes Ave.

The $16 health care fee is not a
hospitalization insurance policy.
The University health insurance
policy costs $82 per year.

others, want nothing further to do,
see orrhear from Kent State. The
Krauses say the affair has already
caused them enough grief, so the
May 4th Coalition respected their
wishes.

After the three buildings were
dedicated, orders rang out over the
hand-held electric megaphones to
“keep the ranks tight and link
arms." Once again the line
slithered around the back of Taylor
Hall.

They moved toward the fence,
tore it down, and continued toward
the construction site. Many feared
arrest, which had been promised by
court order for any trespassers.

When none of those who occupied
the construction site were arrested,
more onlookers moved in to hear

more speeches. _
One faculty observer, identiﬁed

by. a gold armband, spoke of
finances. “I don’t understand it,”
she said. “The university already
has spentmore money prosecuting
all the students arrested to date

than it would have taken to build the
gym on the 17 acres of new land.”
Because she feared retribution, the
faculty member asked not -to be
identified.

Because all the buildings on
campus were locked during the
protest, it was impossible to check
her statement about finances and
other accusations against the
ofﬁcial records.

Despite the rain, now coming
down in a steady stream, the people
remained outside due to lack of
shelters. Some talked, some

gawked, some watched the people ‘

talking and gawking.

From the top of the hill, a woman
screamed, as helmeted police
armed with nightsticks dragged her
through the mud to where six to 10
policemen stood. The police, some
armed with riﬂes, had been
positioned shortly after the demon-
strators left the site.

Eyewitnesses said the woman
was not even within the boundaries
of the protected construction site.
As she was dragged down the hill, a
photographer jumped into the site
about twenty feet ahead of the trio
to shoot a few pictures.

“Get that guy!” one of the
policemen yelled. Within seconds,
the photographer also was seized by
police.

The photographer subsequently
was released after the police
conﬁscated and exposed his film,

Frye Entertains
Pitt Audience

By LEONARD ROMBERG
‘Pitt News Staff Writer

“Unbeleeevable” was the per-
formance and reception of David
Frye last night in David Lawrence
Hall. Frye’s famous impersona-
tions and quick jokes made an
almost-full house of Pitt students
roll over laughing.

Competing with a failing sound
system, Frye wasted no time
digging into his favorite imitation.
Richard Nixon: “I could have
turned down the pardon, but it
would havepbeen the easy thing to
do...I offer to go to prison once a
week during visiting hours, to visit
my former cabinet.”

Frye then added David Frost to
*he situation, having him ask a
sensitive question. Nixon res-
aonded, “Now look here, you...ask
any questions you want. It’s your

privilege as a foreigner.”

Nixon conceded, ‘‘I never cursed
in public. The worst thing I ever
said was ‘trust me’.” As for those
Watergate tapes...“David Eisen-
hower swallowed them.”

Frost asked a ﬁnal question:
“What do you think of -President
Carter?"

Frye let Nixon respond, “If he
wants to stick his nose up a cow’s
rear, that’s ﬁne with me..” ‘

Speaking of Jimmy, “I know
very little about the economy, and
even less on for’n affairs, but I
know how to smile,” said Frye as

, the President.

If Frye’s impersonations were
realistic, his Nelson Rockefeller
might have won an award. In that
low, rough voice, characterizing
the short millionaire, he said. “The

‘Six Men: ’ Refreshing Reading

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Six Men

By Alistair Cooke
Alfred A.Knopf

“Six Men” is Alistair Cooke’s
collection of memoirs about a
half-dozen legendary ﬁgures of the
20th century—Charles Chaplin,
Edward VIII, H.L. Mencken, Adlai
Stevenson, Bertrand Russell and
Humphrey Bogart. Despite the
seemingly odd selections in the
listing, each section is refreshingly
intimate and provides a new
perspective on each man.

The quality of the book differs
from selection to selection. Al-
though Cooke admits that his
relationship with Edward VIII
(better known now as the Duke of
Winsdor) was that of an» acquain-
tance, one of his better drawn

portraits is of the king who gave up
his thrown for an American
divorcee. Cooke’s observation of
Edward, prior to Edward’s ascen-
sion in the mid-1930’s, is capped by
the dry appraisal that “he was at his
best only when the going was
good.”

In contrast, Bogart, whom Cooke
really knew well, is buried under
philosophical meanderings about
Bogart’s film career. Unlike the
other sections, the bulk of the
Bogart piece is background, not
based on a direct time period.

The best chapters probably are
the ones on Chaplin and Mencken.

The Chaplin section deals with

the contrast between the controver-
sial yet widely adored comedian of

the 30’s and the revered old man
honored at the 1974 Oscars. Cooke
reveals much about ‘Chaplin in the

story of a trip taken with Chaplin
and his then-rnistress, Paulette
Goddard, on Chaplin’s yacht, just
prior to the filming of “The Great
Dictator.”

Cooke had brought an 8-milli-

meter movie camera aboard, and

Chaplin mimed characters ranging
from the Prince of Wales to Jean
Harlow. Chaplin recounted his life
in the best Dickens tradition, and
both men discussed world politics
(foreshadowing Chaplin’s problems

with Joseph McCarthy’s blacklists ,

in Hollywood in the 19S0’s). .
Mencken, a satirical writer in the
1920’s who saw the popularity of his
books plummet with the stock
market, was by Cooke’s deﬁnition
“an urban Mark Twain.”
Mencken's, witticisms (‘ ‘Democ-

racy is the theory that the common

had lost their appeal by the time
Cooke met him in 1937.

The relationship of Mencken and
Cooke was not the fan and idol
relationship Cooke had with Chap-
lin; it was one of teacher and pupil.
As Cooke recalls, “He taught me
that there is no such thing as
ideological truth, and that to the
extent that the reporter is a liberal
reporter or a Communist reporter or
a Republican reporter, he is no

3--.-Veporter at all.”

Cooke displays extra depth in
drawing the character of Adlai
Stevenson. Unfortunately, this

' piece is marred by Cooke’s personal

dislike for John and Robert
Kennedy. The account of the
Kennedy brothers attempt to
pressure Stevenson during the
Democratic nomination in 1960—

“the Kennedys had worked their
tails off for Stevenson in 1952 and
1956. If he would not now recipro-
cate, they had no intention of
working their tails off for themsel-
ves, only to hand the nomination to
him on a platter if the Kennedy push
failed at the convention”—is vivid
and arresting. But the entire piece‘
is geared as a smear campaign and
detracts from both Stevenson and
Cooke.

‘ Russell’s section seems to be a
mixture of Cooke’s own feelings
about the events of the late 1940’s
and a gossipy account of the old
man’s sex life. As in the Bogart
piece, Cooke rambles off and
around the tract.

To Cooke’s credit,‘ although he
interjects himself into the story
often, it is not an obviously
contrived move.

But, at times, one is unsure of
what audience Cooke’s aiming at.

Beauty On A Back Street
Daryl Hall and John Oates
RCA

The characteristic and best Hall
and Oates material is rock’n’roll
walking arm-in-arm with soul and
R&B in easy-oozy steps. But when
Hall and Oates (or should I say Hall
or Oates, they’re doing only lyrical
collaborations on this album) alter
this well-mixed and lucrative
trio—well, imagine the Pittsburgh
Symphony playing Black Sabbath
songs. A

In the usual glossy, subdued
production, Hall and Oates present
some ﬁne pieces in the tradition of
“Rich Girl” and “Sara Smile.”
However, a good chunk of “Beauty
On A Back Street” is based on the
tenuous assumption that these
Philly boys can branch off from their
marketable style and still be worth
listening to.

Side one is as easy to take as a
good drink. All but one" of the five

I I Dayl Hall adohn Oates

cuts is Hall and Oates as we know
and want them.

“Don’t Change” and “Why Do
Lovers Break Each Others Hearts, ”
both Hall tunes, are smooth and
easy foot-trappers that feature the
absorbing beats prime to Hall and

Oates’ best numbers.
“You Must Be Good For

Something” comes close to being
straight hard rock, with its
mesmerizing chord progression and
quickened beat. It proves that this
team can rock; enough so that this is

the best number on the album.
One of two Oates compositions on

side one, “The Emptiness,” is the
sleeper: a sluggish soul piece,
fortunately followed by Oates at his
most polished in ‘ ‘Love Hurts (Love
Heals).” Sadly, this better Oates
piece is the only tune on “Beauty
On A Back Street’ ’ to showcase Hall
and Oates harmonizing. Here are
two vocals that complement each
other like wine and cheese.

Side two opts for a split from the
staple Hall and Oates sound of side

New Album Shows Potential 

 

one. Don’t be afraid to scratch it;
aside from the first cut, Hall’s
“Bigger Than Both Of Us,” nothing
is worth taking a stylus to.

“Bad Habits And Infections” is
Hall’s blooper, as bad as the title.
“Winged Bull’’ is an Eastern Ravi
Shankar-type something, while
Oates’ “The Girl Who Used To Be”
sounds like one of those limping
Alice Cooper ballads.

Throughout the album, it is Hall’s
sharp sould vocals and the versatile
fuzzed guitar of .Christopher Bond
that rise as the central elements of
the Hall and Oates sound. Bond also
produced the album, with a wise eye
to the light and mellow.

Lyrically, Hall and Oates are not
poets. Both write their loves, in
often cliched and sometimes
unpardonable ways. But lyrics sung
well are excusable on count of
content, and when put to good
music, as is often the case on
“Beauty On A Back Street,” they
become peripheral.

Holy the Firm

Dillard At Her Best  

Holy the Firm
By Annie Dillard
Harper & Row

B)’ ARTHUR EVEN CHIK

When Annie Dillard won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1974 for “Pilgrim
at Tinker Creek.” “a mystical
excursion into the natural world,”
few people knew what to make of
her.

Drugstores, after all, do not keep
a paperback shelf free for the works
of mystic poets, and popular
pessimism could hardly yield
gracefully to this brilliant young
artist seeking some semblance of
holiness in the rush and fling, of
creation. The whole idea was
simply embarrassing.

Dillard’s second book of prose is
in for much the same treatment.
“The New York Times Review of
Books” made that clear enough in
its fall preview, where “Holy the
Firm” wound up neatly sand-
wiched between Philip Roth’s new

Rockefellow roots go as far back as
money can buy.

“There was a caveman Rocke-
feller. He owned six caves,
including a winter cave in Puerto
Rico. Life comes, death comes,
and when I hear the word proﬁts, I
come." '

Frye continued with Henry

Kissinger. In a strong German
accent, he said of the new
President, “Carter is sane and

competent, but he wants to be
God and no one can take my job
awav.”

novel and a biography of Harry
Truman.

The truth is we had no categories
to encompass Annie Dillard three
years ago, we have none now, and
the reader approaches her new
work wondering where she ﬁnds
the will to pursue her harrowing
cosmic questions. in a world where
they have been largely forgotten.

That world, Dillard once wrote,
is a “splintered wreak I’ve come to
care for,’T and in “Holy the Firm”
she illuminates it once again with
her powerful insight and mastery of
language.

The exquisite texture of her
descriptions, her daring imagery
and the variety of her sources
remain undiminished, and all are
focused toward what she calls “one
of the few questions worth asking,
to wit, ‘What in the Sam Hill is
going on here?’ ”

What. indeed? Faced with a

Discussing Kissinger’s trips to
the Middle East, Frye said, “When
I’m in Israel I say I’m a good Jew,
when I’m in Egypt I say I’m a bad
Jew. One time when I was in Cairo
[ accidentally said I was a good Jew
and they kicked the...out of me.”

Then Frye left the political world
and touched upon some other
famous people. His nasal voice
made an adequate Howard Cosell,
and he lowered it to match the tone
of Muhammad Ali. “I want to ﬁght
women. I want to ﬁght everyone.”

Not as impressive were Frye’s

world of careless cruelty, set
spinning by a power seemingly
indifferent to its fate, Dillard does
not settle for easy solutions.
Religion to her is not piercing the
world’s mysteries in 10 Bible
quotations or less; rather ‘it is
concern, an an extraordinary vision
of the universe in all its complexity.

The mystery remains impen-
etrable, but its very presence
speaks of a sublimity that yields not
to reason at the last, but to poetry.

But does it matter? Or are we
better off dropping the inquiry, and
shuttling Dillard off to a convenient
corner where we won’t interrupt
our literary season?

She fully expects that. She
expect it even from one of her
subjects, a 7-year-old girl burned in
a plane crash, a martyr to the
world’s randomness. As an artist.

quest she cannot abandon.

impersonations of Telly Savalas
and Beatrice Arthur (Maude) even
though he claims there are plenty
of worthwhile present-day actors to
impersonate.

The student audience seemed
most entertained by Frye’s run-
down of the most ridiculous TV
advertisements. “Remember Mor-
ris the cat...not that I’m ﬁnicky,
but I don’t like Nine Lives, ljust
like that tomcat across the street.”

As for Alpo, Frye commented,
“I’d like to see a big doberman
Pinscher pee over Lorne Greene.”

Frye was quite crude in his
comments, but no one cared. In
order for him to secure some
laughs today, crudity may be a
necessity. Frye’s 50-minute show
was entertaining; he received a
standing ovation. His gestuies,
laugh lines and impersonations
gave students a top-ﬂight study
break on a Tuesday night.

It was a day as lousy for Randy Reutershan as it
was glorious for Pitt. The Panthers had just
trounced Notre Dame in the opening game of the
1976 season, 31-10, and were on their way to a
national championship; Reutershan was on his way
to having a cast placed over his foot, broken in the
fourth quarter of the game. The prognosis: out for
six weeks.

Reutershan, however, made the long story into
one. In a week and a half, the cast was off and he
was running.

“I didn’t want to miss the whole season after
playing less than a single game,” he said having been
aware that an additional three or four weeks of
recuperation would be necessary to get the leg back in.
shape if the cast were on six weeks.

“It (the foot) started feeling good and I got
impatient,” he said. “I could play on the Special
teams because they don’t require as much agility as
pass receiving. It’s a matter of running straight down
the field and breaking up the play or making the
tackle.” E

It was because of his early return, however, that

he picked up his reputation as a special teams .

maniac, the guys who, according to Don Meredith,
“just ain't got no respect for their bodies.”

As the season progressed, Reutershan gradually
worked his way back onto the offensive unit, spelling
starting flanker Willie Taylor.

In the fourth quarter of the final ‘regular season
game, against Penn State, the too-rapid return to
action after the injury came back to haunt the super-
quick receiver. The same bone was again
broken-—this\ time a stress fracture due to not giving
the foot enough time to heal.

Reutershan withstood the bother of crutches for
four weeks before returning to practice two weeks
before the Sugar Bowl, in which he played mainly on
the special teams. (Of course, the added agility
didn’t hamper him from sampling the New Orleans
nightlife, either, but that’s another story.)

In March, when spring practice began, Reutershan
was determined to win a starting job. A unique
situation developed as the man he had to beat out for

the job was Willie Taylor, not only a fine receiver 2

 

coming off a good year, but also Reutershan’s
football roommate.

“Willie and I are roommates both on the road and
at the hotel before home games,” he said. “In fact,
they asked us if we wanted to room, and we
agreed.”

But didn’t the competitiveness of the situation lead

to any hard feelings?

“Not at all,” he answered, “because the issue
wasn’t me versus him. I went to practice figuring it’s
me against the job—can I do it——not me against any
one person ”

Senior Randy Reutershan overcame sidelining injuries to

find his way into the Panthers’ starting lineup. Better ‘
known for his special team play, Reutershan pulled in a

touchdown pass in last Saturday's 76-0 massacre of

Temple. '

  Reutershan Back on Right Foot

Reutershan, articulate and extremely easy to talk
to, was asked what the decisive factor in spring
practice was that boosted him to the starting position
at flanker the week before the spring game.

“They were looking both blocking and receiving,
but I think receiving skills most of all,” he said. “I
had a good spring, and I guess Willie’s wasn’t as
good.” He shrugged his hands as if to say, “it’s that
simple.”

‘But—the tale is getting to"be familiar-—spring
practice wasn’t over before the foot was broken a
third itme. On the next-to-last day of spring practice,
Reutershan suffered a second stress fracture. On
went the cast, off went his name from the top_of the
depth chart.

He won the job back for the 1977 opener against
the Fighting Irish and has been alternating with
Taylor and Gordon Jones.

Both Taylor and Reutershan started in the'Temple
blowout—Randy taking the split end spot since he
can play either receiver position. He was also one of
the two game captains, with LeRoy Felder.

Reutershan was asked about the man who picks
the starting teams and the captains, Jackie Sherrill.

“Jackie’s a players’ coach,” he said. “He doesn’t
BS you, and when he says something, he doesn’t just
say it, he follows up and does it.

“If you have a problem, he’ll listen and do what he
can to help,” the senior from New Jersey added.
“And he gets the most from his players because he
drives us so hard. But he drives us like that because
he knows we have it in us to be better players and a
better team.

“If you think about getting hurt, you will——I don’t
think. about it, but I just do a whole lot of praying the
night before,” he answered, with a grin only half-
humorous.

But completely humorous is his relationship with
his school roommate, Randy Holloway.

“Life with Randy Holloway is a constant partiy 1

because there’s always something to laugh about and
people have a good time,” Reutershan said.

Looks Like He Made It

By KAREN KADILAK

From a nobody to a someone.
That situation could very well sum
up the current status of Pitt football
player Gary Silvestri.

From last season, when he was
forced to quit football for a while
due to school problems, to this
season, when he is a prominent
member of the stingy Pitt defense.
Gary Silvestri has made it.

He’s fought adversity. He seems

to have conquered an attitude
problem which,_ in defensive line
coach Bob Matey’s opinion. kept
him from gaining success earlier in
his football career at Pitt.

“Gary always had the ability."
Matey commented. “He just had a
little trouble with his attitude. I
guess you could say he had a
problem of pushing himself. He
didn’t understand that to conquer a
situation you have to confront it
head on. This season. his attitude
has changed. He now believes that

Myslinski, University

To Buy Off Temple

Pitt athletic director Cas Mys-
linski said Tuesday he can’t make a
proﬁt playing football with Temple
and may offer to buy the school off
its schedule. .

‘Major college football is a big
business,” Myslinski said on the
heels of a weekend game in which
Pitt routed Temple, 76-0, before a
sparse crowd in Philadelphia.

“We have to make more money
than we get for playing Temple in
Philadelphia now,”Myslinski add-
ed before Pitt’s weekly football
press luncheon. .

Temple officials said Pitt’s
complaint was premature in light of
the Panthers’ recent arrival as a
college football power.

“Pitt’s living high oﬂ' the hog
right now, ”Temple Athletic Direct-

or Ernest Casale said by phone from-‘

Philadelphia.

Pitt was guaranteed $35,000
when it traveled to Veterans
Stadium Saturday and beat the
Owls, but the Panthers need 5,1»
million a year to run their football
program, Myslinski said

Attendance would have swelled
the purse, since Pitt was assured a
percentage of gate receipts, but
only 13,199 fans showed up.

”We make well over $100,000 a
year when we play West Virginia,
Penn ‘State ‘or Notre Dame,“
Myslinski said. “We can’t afford to
play teams that don’t draw well.”

Myslinski said he will ask Temple
to move its three remaining games

Paris Plasters
‘ Court Opponents  

Maria Paris, number-one player on the women’s tennis team, was
feeling restless. Although she easily had beaten her Slippery Rock
opponent earlier that afternoon, a slight edge of competitive tension
remained.

‘ ‘I'm in that kind of mood where I just want to call people on the phone
just so’s I can talk to somebody, anybody,” she said.

So far this year, Paris has had little problem winning at tennis; she has
lost only two gamesin two matches. A junior from Largo, Florida, she
was named most valuable player of her team and won Eastern tennis’
Saranac Cup in her freshman season at Pitt.

Maria Sciullo

 

Maria, the daughter of a chemist and a prima ballerina, lived in
Argentina until the age of six, when her family moved to the United
States. Her older brother, also a fine tennis player, has been a doubles
partner of Argentina’s Guillermo Vilas, the 1977 US Open champion.

Throughout her high school years, Paris was ranked among the top 10
players in the state. Undefeated in regular season singles during those
four years, she once had to play an up-and-coming player named Chris

Evert mthe state tournament. Paris lost the third-round match, 6-2, 6-2.
Of course, many colleges offered scholarships, and Paris accepted one
from Pitt partly because she wanted to see some snow:

George Panthers’ Missing l.ink

ByKARENKADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer,

Pitt offensive guard George Link
stood in the middle of one of the
many plush hallways in the
Crossgateslnn with a smile on his
face. One of the guests Pitt head
coach Jackie SHerrill brought along
with him to yesterday’s weekly
press luncheon, he didn’t mind the
cameras ﬂashing in his face or the
media people grabbing at his huge
arms asking for a comment here, a
comment there.

For a change, the offensive
lineman was basking in the
limelight. Second-string lineman, a
group the senior from Uniontown,
Pa. belonged to before this season,
don’t get interviewed on television.
Their pictures aren’t in the papers.
Their comments aren’t worth a cup
of coffee.

The attention was indeed a new
experience for Link. But then again,
the whole season has been
something new for the five-year
lineman. For the first time in his
extended career at Pitt, Link is
starting for the Panthers as a right
offensive guard.

“George has had to struggle,”
Sherrill commented at yesterdays
press gathering. “But if ‘he keeps
progressing the way he has been,_he

could very well be one of the best
offensive lineman Pitt has had in a
long time.”

Already, Link could be consider-
ed of the true success stories on this
year's Pitt squad. This is something
newsworthy in itself, since Link had
reservations earlier this year about
coming back and playing football at
all. Last season was officially Link's
senior season. But since he missed
his entire freshman season with a
case of mononucleosis, he had
another year of eligibility.

Sherrill invited Link back. He told
him he had a good chance to start.
But a good chance to start wasn’t
enough for Link.

A ‘‘If I didn't start, 1 don’t think 1
would have come back for this

season,” Link said. “There was no ,

way I could have come back and not
start after playing second team for
four years. It would have been
worthless.

“But I had good spring practice,
so when Coach told me I would be
starting this season as offensive
guard, I decided to give it another
try.
“It’s a good feeling to be able to
start,” Link added. ‘‘It gives me a
feeling of accomplishment.”

A feeling of accomplishent often
amounts to some well-deserved

publicity. A smiling George Link gate -

his share of it yesterday.

Casale said he wasn’t aware of
Pitt’s dissatisfaction with the
series. He noted that the teams
agreed to meet in 1966, when Pitt
was a collegiate football doormat.

“They've beaten us pretty good
in the last couple years, but that’s
not a good reason to drop us,” he
said,.citing the West Virginia-Penn
State series as an example of
traditional one-sided matchups.

“West Virginia hasn’t beaten
Penn State for as long as I can
remember, yet they don’t get
dropped from a schedule,” he said.

St ate 43 times since 1904, compiling
a 7-34-2 record. The last time West
Virginia beat Penn State was in
1955.

Pitt is 4-0 against Temple since
the two teams started their recent
series in 1974 and 5-1-1 overall.

Myslinski said Pitt’s position  A 

based on economics, not won-lost
records, however.

‘ ‘Whether we win or lose isn’t the
problem in this case,” Myslinski
said. “It’s a question of getting-
people in the stands.”

Casale refused to say whether
Temple would accept a settlement
from Pitt to discontinue the football
series. '

  One- way Tennis  Trip  

Ends A t Pitt's Paris

' (Continued from Page 18)

“Once during my freshman year, Iheard Myron Cope say it was going
to snow that night,” she recalled. “I set my alarm clock for 12:30 and
made my roommates all get up to watch a snow ﬂurry!”

Despite numerous acheivements and awards (including a “Maria
Paris Day” in Largo), Paris still is dissatisﬁed with her game. “My
college career hasn't been as good as I wanted it to be. I have not

accomplished as much as I did in Florida,” claimed Paris. “I mean, in
Florida you have such great players that it really helped to play against
the best.”

Although ranked among the top six female netters in the East, Maria
noted that the majority of the girls she grew up with in tennis now are
playing on the professional circuit. From childhood, she wanted to be a
pro, but now her goals are sightly altered. ,

‘ ‘I want to be like Chris (Evert) and do commercials, ’ ’ she joked. ‘ ‘No,
really, at the rate I’m going, I don’t think I’ll ever get to the top 10 in the
pros, so maybe I could get into journalism or broadcasting or maybe
even be a pro at some club.”

She paused, then added, ‘ ‘I would like to be the same kind of player as
Evonne Goolagong. She’s happy with her tennis, her life and herself and
that’s what I want to be.”

When the subject of the controversial Renee Richards arose, Paris
smiled, said she wouldn't mind playing against her but then mentioned
something about probably being too psyched out if she did.

This past summer, Maria returned to Florida somewhat depressed
about tennis; she quit playing for two months. The vacation seemed to
help, for now Paris is pounding opponents in what she claims is “my
year.”

Later on, in a jovial mood, Maria looked over the notes from the
interview and warned against calling her “petite” or any of the other
phrases sportswriters use when describing a female athlete. “This one
guy wrote an article about me and he said I was ‘pert and bubbly.’ So
the next day I walked around like a champagne bottle to live up to my
image.”

Women Harriers Sixth

By ANGELA vavmms

While most of the campus was
still asleep, last Sunday the
women's cross country team was on
its way to Penn State, _where the
Pantherettes were about to face
some of the toughtest competition
in Pennsylvania.

The ﬁeld consisted of 150 girls
from seven schools along with
independent runners. Pitt’s Becky
Falck ﬁnished 24th while teammate
Theresa Walton placed 27th.
Pantherettes Brenda Chorpenning
and Diane Miller ﬁnished 37th and
38th respectively, while Kathy
Paczkowski was 42nd and Jenny
Westman was 64th.

Penn State and Rutgers each had
two teams competing, so there were
10 teams overall. One of the Penn
State squads placed ﬁrst. Pitt
ﬁnished sixth.

The girls warmed up in a hard
rain but by the time the race was
scheduled to begin, the rain had

stopped. The day remained fairly‘

cold and the course was wet.

Near the outset of the race, the
course narrowed to a single lane.
Because the girls were still in a wide
pack instead of strung out, there
was a scramble for running room.
