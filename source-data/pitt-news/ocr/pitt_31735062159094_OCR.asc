Wherein The Future
Of Sheer Silk Hose
Looms Before Us

.- "  .

BY LEOPOLD KOEBERLEIN

Divergent attacks upon a
pressing social problem are
under way on campus by two
groups of students, each work-
ing independently and each
promising to continue its ef-
forts during the remainder of this
yet young semester.

The problem is centered about
what seems to be a modern neces-
sity for the feminine members of
society—silk hosiery—and the two
groups which are working towards
a solution are the coeds of the Re-
search Bureau for Retail Training
and the members of Pitt Peace
Council.

Retail Training students assum-
ed that’ silk stockings are here to
stay. Peace Council, noting that
the largest Japanese import to
the United States is raw silk, has
decided that silk stockings must
go until Nipponese aggression in
the Orient stops.

Unusual Class

The retail training students’
work is part of an unusual class
in merchandising and sales pro-

motion given at the Bureau, this,
Silk hosiery is under con-

year. A
sideration, and the...... students are
learning show,-ato .‘buy it from the
manufacturer and sell it to the
customer. Fashion experts, ho-
siery technicians, experienced
buyers", advertising managers, are
all giving the class some of the
history behind the industry.
Peace Council’s work has de-
veloped from a study of the world
peace situation and the conclusion
that the only way to stop the Ja-
panese in their undeclared war in
China while at the same time not
involving the United States gov-
ernment, is to impose economic
sanctions by a consumers’ boycott.
This, says advocates of Peace
Council’s program, will eventual-
ly stop Japanese credit and make
it impossible for the militaristic
government to continue its ag-

gression.
‘LisIe’s The Style’
In the meantime, “gauges,

threads, construction,” says a news
release, “are all part of the re-
tail students’ new hosiery vocab-
ulary, although they are still a
mystery to most women who are
skimping on their lunches to buy
a pair of sheer chiffons. Because
of the risks involved in buying
this important wardrobe item,
manufacturers have announced
that soon stockings will carry the
story of how much wear can ex-
pected from the stockings, for
what occasion they are suitable,
and how they should be washed
and cared for.” '

Coincidentally, Peace Council
has adopted the slogan “Lisle is
the Style,” and feminine advocates
of the anti-Japanese boycott have
subscribed to a policy of wearing
no silk hose, hose which retail
training students claim have been
the cause of the “best-dressed
feminine legs in the world.”

And there seems to be but one
point on which Peace Councillers
and Retail Trainers might accept
as being in accord with the work
of each. It comes from one of the
men students in the retail training
class as sound advice to fellow
men who brave the stocking
counters for gifts for their girl
friends:

“If you aren’t certain of her
stocking size,” he says, “it’s a good
bet to take a risk on size 9%, the
correct size for about 80 per cent
of all women. If you will insist
on gallantly presenting your girl
of the moment with size 8 stock-
ings, the smallest size sold, your
Cinderella will probably be back
to the hosiery counter to exchange
your gift for a healthy size 9% or
10.”

And so, while the silk worms
and the lisle worms rear their
heads, time passes and summer
anklets will run them both into
eclipse.

Today’s Program‘

Books Recital
By Hans Merx

In cooperation with the de-
partment of modern languages,
the Concert Hour committee
will present Hans Merx, folk
singer, in a program of folk
music today at 3:30 o’clock in
2317 Cathedral.

Today’s program is open to
University students, faculty mem-
bers, and their friends. Mr. Merx
is appearing in recital today fol-
lowing a concert given last week
at the University of Wisconsin,
and his recitals here and at Wis-
consin are a part of a United
States concert tour.

The singer has completed four
years of study and research in
England, where he arranged many
of the folk sings of England and
Scotland. These will be presented
on the program this afternoon, in
addition to the songs of Germany.

“This is the second folk singer
the Concert Hour committee has
presented this season,” states
Robert Brown, C39, head of the
Concert Hour committee.

“Our other singer, John Jacob
Niles, gave a program that was
devoted exclusively to American

song lore. Mr. Merx will sing
similar type songs ‘of western
Europe.”

Brown also announced that stu-
dent musicians who play in dance‘
orchestras would be assembled for
a program of swing music later in
the semester. For the rest, the
program will be composed of re-
cordings and student recitals, in-
terposed with occasional programs
such as the one today.

Oregon Style
Radio Debate

Two members of the Women’s
debate met a team from Penn
State College yesterday afternoon
in a radio debate over station
WWSW.

Lorraine Simpson, C39, secre-
tary of the Debate Association,
and Margaret Byrne, Ed39, advi-
ser to the Public Speaking unit,
made up the University team.
Ruth Liachowits and Elizabeth
Hatton were the Penn State de-
baters.

Both the Penn State speakers
are sophomores making their ﬁrst
intercollegiate trip. They were
accompanied by Clayton A.
Schug, instructor in public speak-
ing and Women’s debate manager.
Miss Genevieve Blatt is debate
coach at the University.

The debate followed the Oregon
style, using the question: “Re-
solved that the National Labor
Relations Board be empowered to
enforce arbitration in industrial
disputes.”

Retail Training Director Hos
Unique Business Background

By SARI ROSENBERG 9

At the head of the University’s
Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing is a man whose career is as
unique as the Bureau he directs.

He is Bishop Brown, Whose
career has led him from college
to war; from
war to the pub-
lishing business
and years of
experience in

many modern
d e p a r t In ent
stores. Since
1929 Mr. Brown
has been di-
rector of the
Research Bu-
reau for Retail
Training at the
University.

A graduate of Dartmouth Col-
lege, Mr. Brown also did graduate
work at Harvard University. But
the World War interrupted his
studies and he enlisted with the
Harvard ambulance corps.

Following a rapid training
course in Allentown, Pennsylva-
nia, the Harvard unit was sent to
serve in the 25th Division of the
French army. While located at a
French ﬁrst-aid station at the

 

Mr. Brown

front, Mr. Brown was decorated
for courageous service by the

French Government with the
“Croix de Guerre.”

Returning to Boston he went to

work for Houghton, Mifﬁin & Co.,
a publishing house, which experi-
ence, he declares, gave him a dis-
agreeable taste for printers’ ink.
Because the war had depleted
their personnel, department stores
at this time were hiring college-
trained men and so Brown went
to work for the Jordon Marsh
Company in Boston, one of the
oldest and largest stores in Amer-
lC8..

His positions with the ﬁrm in-
cluded executive of the training
squad and later personnel man-
ager. When the Jordon Marsh
Company bought the C. F. Hovey
& Co. store, Mr. Brown was made
superintendent of the latter. After
three years in the Hovey store he
managed a specialty store for Jays
Incorporated. a

Grounded in this experience,
Bishop Brown came to the Uni-
versity in 1929 as Director of the
Research Bureau for Retail Train-
ing and has since held that posi-
tion.

Chancellor Bowman To S peak
At Student Assemhly Friday

Making his ﬁrst appearance this year before the student body,

Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor

of the University, will address a

general assembly Friday morning at 11:30 o’clock in Memorial Hall.

Friday morning class hours will be cut to 45 minutes each and no
classes will be in session during the assembly period.

Vvhile he has chosen no deﬁnite topic for Friday’s address, Dr.
Bowman will probably discuss the value of University experience and
what students should gain in addition to the practical skills which

they acquire.

It has been suggested that Dr. Bowman will introduce to the stu-
dent body Rufus Fitzgerald who arrived from the University of Iowa
at the beginning of this semester to accept the position of University

provost.

Friday’s assembly is probably the outgrowth of a suggestion made
to Dr. Bowman at the ﬁrst meeting of the Student-Faculty Association

assembly this year. At that meeting, the Assembly passed a resolu- 
tion. requesting Dr. Bowman to address the student body at an assem- 5
hly this year to “present his ideas of the spirit of

Scientiﬁc Fraternity
Holds Formal Dinner
~. To Honoao25 Tonight

Collembolae, honorary natural
science fraternity, will celebrate
its 15th anniversary at a dinner
tomorrow night in 1017 Cathedral.

Dr. Cartledge, asistant profes-
sor at the University of West Vir-
ginia, will speak on Genetics. The
program will also include moving

pictures and slides taken on ﬁeld
trips. Dr. Cartledge is a former
member of the biology department
of the University.

Collembolae was organized on
Valentine’s day, 1923, by a group
of University students who had
spent the previous summer study-
ing at Cold Springs Harbor, Long
Island. They named the club for
the tiny Wingless insects which
they had studied there.

Three years ago the club was
officially recognized as an honor-
ary fraternity, tapping its mem-
bers for scholarship. Collembolae
tapping is unique in that the mem-
bers are not chosen for scholar-
ship alone. Prospective members
must attend the ﬁeld trips and
dinner meetings before they are
eligible for entrance.

The activities of the group in-
clude dinner meetings twice a
month, and ﬁeld trips once a
month. University professors of
geology, botany and zoology su-
pervise the ﬁeld trips. At the din-
ner meetings, various prominent
scientists are invited to speak.
Dinners are prepared by the mem-
bers of the organization. All these
meetings are open to the public,
not only to science majors.

Movie Script
Writers Invited
To Conference

Students who signed up to write
the scenario of Philip Elliott’s new
movie are invited to attend a
meeting today at 3:30 o’clock in
2304 Cathedral.

Writing of the script for the
movie will be under the direction
of Frederick P. Mayer, associate
professor of English.

C Mr. Mayer asks students to
bring suggestions for a story to
the meeting.

Last Wednesday many students
expressed their desire to partici-
pate in the production of the new
movie by attending the screening
of “Spring Class” in the ﬁne arts
library. At that time students
signed up to work on some phase
of the movie scenario, acting, or
photography.

BY JERRY HAHN

“Peace depends on economic
stabilization at expense of stand-
ard of living,” Dr. E. C. Schaal,
director of.Student Peace service
at Philadelphia, said at the Inter-
collegiate Peace Conference, held
yesterday at Heinz House.

Discussing “Collective Secur-
ity—Our Way Out?” Dr. Schaal
decried the new meaning of col-
lective security, which considers it
a. “military alliance between sev-
eral nations to oppose other na-
tions.”

“We have a parallel situation
today, similar to the complex sit-
uation before and during the
World War,” Dr. Schaal pointed
out. “Germany was held entirely
responsible for the Great War,
which was due rather to a complex
international situation.” He said
that we had punished Germany
‘but she later wiggled out of re-
strictions placed upon her.

Referring to Japan’s aggression
in China, Dr. Schaal said that

Western nations have competed

Funeral services for Dr. Raleigh
R. Huggins, dean of the Univer-

yesterday afternoon from his resi-

Dr. Huggins died early Sunday
morning in the Elizabeth Steel
Magee hospital after a long ill-
ness. He was 68 years old. He is
survived by his wife.

After graduation from Miami
Medical college in 1891, Dr. Hug-
gins moved to Pittsburgh and en-
gaged in general practice in
Sharpsburg. For seven years he
took post-graduate work in lead-
ing surgical clinics in this country
and abroad.

Early in his medical career he
became a member of the staff of
St. Francis hospital and for many
years was chief of the Gynecolog-
ical Service.

In 1919 he was appointed dean
of the School of Medicine and
professor of gynecology. About
the same time he was appointed
medical director of the Elizabeth

the Gynecological Service in that
institution.

with Japan and therefore are par-
tially responsible for the “Chinese
debacle.” “It is my belief that
20 years from now, historians will
record the Far East situation as a
complex world situation.

“We cannot bluff Japan,” he
said, “without resorting to force.
If we did crush Japan she would
be turned back to her original
boundaries. Even while she was
subdued, Japan would act like a
punished child: we would have
a sullen Japan!”

Dr. Schaal urged that we should
take a realistic view of the Far
East situation. He said that if
the so-called “democratic nations”
would help China, they would ex-
pect and take economic beneﬁts for
themselves. “We are having a
French picnic compared to what
would happen then,” he remarked.

“Economic distress” as a basic

men with their houses. and the
men who make up their groups.
Silence period will begin Sun-
day and will last until Thursday
afternoon at 5 o’clock. During
this period, the men who have
been rushed will inform the dean
of men’s ofﬁce of their decision
as to pledging and choice of fra-
ternity . The newly-pledged fresh-
men will attend dinners at their
houses at 5 o’clock Thursday.

Larry Orr, C40, member of In-
terfraternity Council in charge of
rushing activities, announces that
all fraternities have been ac-

men have also heard discussions
of fraternities and the nature of
rushing during their orientation
classes.

RULES LISTED

Fridays Speaker
Can Tell Us Much

A(:?CORDING to a front page story today,
Chancellor =‘»own1an’s address before the
student body Friday is “P1“0b3b1Y the Out‘
growth of a suggestion made to Dr. Bowman
at the first meeting of the Student—Faculty As-
sociation assenibly this year.”

Purpose of the request originating in SFA}
was that the Chancellor explain to the students’
certain raisons d’etre in the program of the
University.

To Dr. Bowman, we would make this sug-
gestion; we want to know something more
about general administrative policy; we want
to be acquainted with the tenets of the educa-
tional theories emanating from State Hall.
And we want to know of certain speciﬁc
things: of the proposed Student Union, of a
cafeteria, for instance.

\Ve are interested in these things because we
are students at the University.

 

A Letter

TO AN UNKNOWN JAPANESE

One of these days I shall kill you. I do not
yet know how it will happen or when. Per-
haps it will be in a muddy ditch in north China
with the cold rain pouring down, a ditch that
I shall try to take from you or you from me—
even though neither of us wants it! Perhaps
you will die by a shell, a huge, two thousand
pound shell, which I shall send hurtling from
one of our new seventy million dollar battle-
ships. Perhaps I shall fly over from our
Alaskan air base and blow you to pieces as you
sleep. Perhaps I shall rip out your guts on
some south Paciﬁc island that neither you nor
I have ever seen before. '

I do not want to kill you, but I shall have no
choice. I live with people who are afraid of
you, just as you live with some who are afraid
of me. And because my people are afraid they
are building warships and making riﬂes and
sharpening bayonets and éﬁlling bombs and
compounding gas to defend themselves against
their fear.

When people are afraid they hate easily.
One day my people will say out of their hate
and fear: “The Japanese would destroy us.
lV'c must destroy them first.” Then I shall be
given a gun or a ship or a bomb and be sent
out to kill you.

I must tell you now, while I still am allowed
to write to you, that I shall kill you against my
Will. So when my cold steel slices into your
belly, or when my bullets tear away your face,
or when you hear the midnight drone of my
plane above your home, know that I come not
inhatred but in sorrow and that in destroying
you I am also destroying myself.

Until our meeting, then, I wish you peace.

—-New Mexico Lobo.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Again, the dear friend of ‘the University and
SFA, Mr. Robert Saffron, has come forth with an
opinion which, to my mind, is nothing but a hodge-
podge of balderdash and drivel. In discussing the
refusal of our SFA Executive Committee to recog-
nize the American Student Union, Mr. Saffron has
resorted to that old, shop-worn platitude: “We
must protect our freedom of speech!”

For a man who abhors politics and all that is
connected with it, our friend has taken great pains
to cloud the issue in the best Tammany Hall man-

 

press himself in any manner whatsoever. But
when the freedom of speech, which is guaranteed
by our Constitution, acquires the pseudo-authority
and tacit approval of a great educational institu-
tion such as the University, it ceases to be freedom
of speech and begins to be propaganda.

As far as SFA is concerned, Mr. Saffron and his
ASU can express any opinions they desire just :30
long as they can not be construed to be the opinions
of anybody else These opinions should not
have the 3.ppearance of being the expressions of
the University. .

For this reason, the Committee decided to refuse
.recognition’to ASU on the basis of the above-men-
tioned distinction between propaganda and freedom
of speech; that is, -opinions cloaked in a shroud of
authority tend to be accepted without proof and
therefore become propaganda in its worst sense.

I want it to be understood that these are :ny own
opinions and shouldn’t be misconstrued as being
those of the Executive Committee of SFA.

———Lester A.‘ Hamburg, C38.
Editor, The Pitt News:

I see by The Pitt News today that the Student-
Faculty Association has refused to recognize the
American Student Union. By this move SFA has
done, not only irreparable harm to itself as  dem-
ocratic institution, but has unwittingly furthered
materially the cause of the condemned organization
on the Pitt campus.

It is nothing but human nature for people to feel
sorry for an under-dog. The ASU has been just
that in’ its long struggle for existence on our campus.
SFA,-~by bringing the thing to a head, by provok-
ing your long editorial in the union’s behalf, has
caused public sentiment to take sides with the or-
ganization kickedin the pants.’ ‘

No minority organization is entitled to the pub-
licity the American Student Union has garnered in
The Pitt News. With the long drawn-out haggling
that SFA has been through, it was inevitable that
this organization has brought into the limelight a
group that, having received recognition, would have
taken the quiet little niche in campus life to which
it rightfully belongs.

———Estelle R. Kovacs, C40.
Editor, The Pitt News:

As a new student at Pitt, all the school activi-
ties, programs, and school policies are naturally
magniﬁed because of this change in type of educa-
tion. One factor of the school setup (probably the
largest factor) is that a large number of
teachers have become mentally stagnated. Their
class room lectures are monotonous reiterations of
previous lectures. They drape themselves over the
lecture stands in a typical speak-easy sprawl.

The acoustic conditions are poor in most of the

A lecture rooms, but these teachers insist upon using

an effortless, monotonous tone in delivering their
stereotyped lectures.

The young teachers still possess enough interest
in their classes to carry on intelligent discussions.
Isn’t it about time that some of the faculty adopt-
ed a method of teaching that contains more initi-
ative than the previous methods.

Roamin’ Round

The latest campus romance and felicitations are
to be thrown to our gal Muriel Lowy who is blind-
ing her friends with Bob Fleischman’s 142 carrot
ring. It will have a gold partner sometime in June.
And speaking of leaving the fold, lovely Arlene
Broicla sailed away to Europe leaving Sid Tump-
son to stoke the home ﬁres. Lenny (Bull Pen)
Levison ran into the sad two as they parted at the
station. Sid told Lenny that Arlene was leaving
and to say goodbye. Our Levison took one look at
the sad couple—coughed, and said, “So long, Ar-
lene,” and ducked. (I think they managed without
him).

To contradict Monday’s column, Ernie Holmok
did not sit home Friday nite “because Mel engi-
neered with Ralph” but tripped the light fantastic
at P.C.W.’s Junior Prom which looked more like a‘
Pitt dance than did the Engineers’ Brawl. Ten
Delts by actual count.

Among the aﬁairs that have gezunked of late is
the Betty Teal-Harry Erikson combine. She Heart-
Hopped with one Tom Stephenson. The angle on
this is that Erikson just gave Betty his sweetheart
pin. That’s all girls care about——pin money.

Marshall Collects

The Tri-Delts had a visitor the other day in a
highly inebriated old woman who refused to budge
from their front steps. I sti.ll don’t know whether
they pledged her or not. A note on a chewing-gum
wrapper informs us that Marshall Goldberg re-
ceived another gold football for being on the Jewish
All-American team. The scene, the Harlem Casino.

Our oomphy Ariel Conrad it seems is making

Lefty denies that he got that way from sucking his

time Bob arrived promptly in time to set up. That

It seems Georgia Jenkins is Purdue conscious to
the extent of three special delivery letters on one
Monday morning. The mail man is beginning to
believe in the “better mouse trap” theory. Harriet
Wertkin also comes under this heading. Barney

Hitler;

Germany

By foseph

Ready T o Defy .

World Or Play Opportunist

McCIosI<ey

The developments in international affairs which marked
the end of last week may well be taken as an indication that
Germany considers herself “ready” ‘to defy; the world.

On the other hand, the seizure of'Austria and the bold
statements of Hitler before the Reichstag may simply mean that
Hitler is again playing the opportunist "s hand. In the recently
reported conversations between Italy and England regarding a

Mediterranean accord may lie the¢_

clue to the present situation.

To secure the economic sufﬁci-
ency so vital to his policy, Hitler
has apparently ‘determined to
seize the Ukraine, masking his
aims behind anti-Communist ver-
biage. “Fully realizing" that he
alone is too weak to cope with
Russia, he has sought and ob-

tained the amity of Japan, the
other great “anti-Communist”
power.

Should the present conversa-

tions with Italy permit England
torelease a great" part of her Med-
iterranean ﬂeet for service in the
Far East, Japan’s value to Ger-
many would be greatly" decreased
in the event of war with Russia.
And so, there is a strong proba-

bility that Hitler has killed’ two
birds with onestone by his pres-
ent maneuver: he has not only
advanced his policy of Pan-Ger-
manism, but he has also helped
his strongest ally.

For there is little probability
that England will consummate a
Mediterranean accord with Italy
at a time when Germany is
threatening the Central European
balance of power, “that is, unless
she can obtain very deﬁnite com-
mitments from Mussolini.”

And if England gets Mussolini:

on her side now, I-Iitler’s position
will be more deﬁnite;- at least
Italy won’t have the» opportunity
to sell him out as she did his pre-

decessors during the World War.

Dr. McKinley Favors
Use Of Imlomc Organ

Amateur Organ Enthusiast Plays Low-Priced

Instrument In Home

‘For Own Amazement’

By Estelle Kovacs

“The organ is an excellent medium for the interpretation

of classical and folk music.

Interest in the organ has increased

in the past few years due to the manufacture of low-priced in-

struments that may be installed in one ’s home.”

These are the

conclusions drawn by Dr. George Murray McKinley, instructor

in biology, and

amateur organ:

enthusiast, who recently installed
a small organ in his home.

“I am entirely an amateur; I
play the organ solely for my own
amazement,” Dr. McKinley said.
But the knowledge he has garner-
ed in the ﬁeld of organ technique,
and organ music literature puts
him decidedly not in the amateur
class.

NOW A HOBBY

When asked if the organ has
possibilities as an instrument for
classical repertoire, Dr. McKinley
said. “Deﬁnitely, yes. The ex-
pert organist has in his instru-
ment a wide range of possibili-
ties. He commands every con-
ceivable shade of musical com-
bination; he is, in reality an en-
tire potential symphony orches-
tra.”

Dr. McKinley’s interest in the
organ has been a hobby of his for
many long years now. In earlier
days, he was interested primarily
as an appreciative spectator,
learning all he could about organ
literature, and collecting record-
ings of famous musicians.

MUSIC WITH COLOR

But a few years ago, Dr. Mc-
Kinley decided to take a hand at
the thing himself. He now has
one of the newer Hammond or-
gans in his home, taking great de-
light from the folk songs and
melodies that he can produce on
the instrument.

He stresses, however, his ama-
teur standing. But the amateur
organist can realize great satisfac-

’ tion out of his music early in his

career as a player. This, Dr. Mc-
Kinley, added is due to the fact
that organ music has a color all of
its own.

Dr. McKinley owns one of the
ﬁnest collections of recorded or-
gan music in the city. He had

started his collection as far back
as 1923, and has many interesting
things to relate about the earlier
ventures in recording organ mu-
sic.

jamcs Reagan
Adds New Quirk
To M ystiﬁcation

ians, but there is only one Jimmy
Reagan, the magician!

Today Reagan, C40, claimed an-
other distinction, in addition to
being Pittsburgh’s only represen-
tative magician working his way
through college.

“Magic with a plot,” is Jimmy’s
title for his new discovery, which
he claims has never been tried
before by magicians. “I work in
a story with my act, involving
my assistant, Mary Craig,
music.”

Jimmy hasn’t given his “magic
with a plot” a try yet, because the
music isn’t completed. But it will
be done by the end of the month,
and then Jimmy Reagan will give
his act its public try—out. Al-

ready, however, he has gone over
the idea with Francis Carlisle,
New York magician who just left
for a trip to Venezuela. Carlisle
called the idea “refreshingly
original and novel.’’

During the past several months
the student magician has perform-
ed at many local institutions. Aft-
er showing inmates of Mayview
his act including a trick of tear-
ing a dollar bill into four, Jimmy
had one anxious fellow come up
to him. “Mister, I’ve got a little
money saved; if you can do your
trick with it, maybe I can get out
of this place.”

Hockey Falls In To Both
Letter And Spirit Of Code

By Leonard Levison I

 

If you are wondering what Pitt athl.et!ics will eventually
develop into after they have been submitted to the recently-pro-
vided washtubbing, we offer you the only tangible evidence thus
far . . . Exhibit A, the Pitt hockey team . . . which as far as pure
amateur-isni is concerned is  white as snow before it falls in
Pittsburgh . . . hockey has virtually reached the point where it

is the most popular of the col-¢

legiate sports on the winter cal-
endar . . at least, it has shown
the most spectator appeal ; . .

Outdraw Floormen

Continuing at the pace it has
set thus far in attracting p-eople
to sit in the bleachers, it very well
threatens to outdraw basketball
which is supposedly the top indoor
sport . . . when Temple made its
appearance in Pittsburgh toplay
the ﬁgureeighters forwhat at that
moment was the Conference ﬁrst
place, the skaters were roughing it
out with Duquesne for the rank-
ing position in the ice league . . .
that Wednesday night there were
still a good many seats to be had
in the Stadium Pavillion . . . but
every allotted Pitt seat in the Har-
ris Hanger was gobbled . . . this
evidence only substantiated the
popular feeling that at that par-
ticular time the campus interest
was lumped up behind the sport
of swinging sticks and stitched
noses .

J immy Hagan, athletic overseer,
was rather skeptical about the ice
sport when the boys ﬁrst came to
him and pleaded for the Univer-
sity’s backing . although he
readily gave it official approval

. . now he has gone overboard
for it . . . .

Inﬂuence On VVhite

Hurrying down from the Sta-
dium ﬂoor after the Owl game to
the ice melee with the Dukes at
the Garden, on the eve of the an-
nouncement of the new athletic
code, he said . . “That hockey
team is a real example of how
sports will be conducted under our
revised rules . . . those boys are
having the time of their lives . .
and their contagion has spread to
the student body which is enthu-
siastically behind them” .

Whizzer White, who is deliber-
ating between the Rooney parlay
money and the cloisters around
the Thames, has received a rather
subtle suggestion to become a
Yank at Oxford . . the South-

ern California Rugby Association
has made him an honorary mem-
ber . . with the hope that he
will participate in the old English
sport during the period of his Eng-
lish stay through the courtesy of
Cecil Rhodes .

Hyatt Around

“Charley the Chipper” Hyatt,
who comes as close as a good crip

‘shot tobeing the greatest basket-

ball players of all time . . . at
least he is Pitt’s and this dis-
trict’s ﬁnest . . is playing out
his last year of the ﬂoor game . .
Saturday and Sunday he led his
Phillips 66 crew against the Los
Angles ‘AC and the Hollywood AC
quintets in games» played in the
Pan-Paciﬁc Auditorium  ,
Georgetown’s ace forward, ‘Har-
ry. Bassin,. who is always at his
best against Pitt, is going to be
Lou Gherig’s ﬁrst base under-
study this summer upon gradua-
tion from the Washington school
. . he will spend most of his
time in the Yankee farm at New-
ark . . the Conference’s ace
center, Mike Bloom of Temple, is
slated to spend his basketball time

next year playing for the Sphas L

. . a Philadelphia pro team . . .
the city high school league’s lead-
ing scorer, Roger Jorgenson of
Taylor Allderdice . . son of the
Pirates’ trainer is at this
early point headed for Temple . . .
where he should make Jimmy

Boxers Given Favorite
Rating Over Penn State

Pitt ’s best boxing team since its start eight years ago, will
travel to State College next Saturday to help celebrate a ground
breaking, and incidentally, to ﬁght Penn State’s boxing team.

The ground breaking will

be presided over by Governor

Earle, but the boxing match will be presided over by the

Panthers.

The Panthers are favored to take over the Lions for the

ﬁrst time in history but the edge?

isn’t any too great. The State team
has gone down a little from their
usual high standard, but with
Sammy Donata owning a record
of 16 bouts won and only two
draws, and the other State boys at
their peak form, the match won’t
be any pushover.

On the only two occasions the
Panthers and Lions have met,
State has come through with wins.
Last year, however, when State
had its best team, Pitt gave itone
of its toughest meets. The come
down on the part of State and
Pitt’s corresponding improvement
is expected to even things up.

INEXPERIENCED TEAM

Coach Houck, at the beginning
of this season had to build prac-
tically from scratch. The’ only
varsity men left were Donato,
Sopchak and Tapman. These
three, together with Al ‘Bolder,
165-pound knock—out artist are
the nucleus of this year’s team.

Sammy Donato, States’ captain
and one of the best intercollegiate

ﬁghters in the sport and co-cap- .
tain of the last year’s football :
team, will ﬁght in the 145-pound I

class. His opponent will prob- .
ably be Jed Curzi, Pitt 145- ‘\
pounder.

HEAVIES SHOW POORLY

Coach Shricker expressed dis-
satisfaction with the ﬁghters in
his heavier divisions, and is un-
decided who to use. In the 155-
pound class he will either use
Ray Bombe or John Nuener. If
he uses Neuner, the other divi-
sions will move up a step, Bombe
ﬁghting in the 165-pound class,
while Ashman will move into the
175-pounders.

The other Pitt ﬁghters will be
either Dorand or Livingston in the
115-pound class, and Wargo un-
defeated 125-pounder, who has
four knock-outs to his credit. The
heavyweight match will be for-
feited.

APTAIN Ralph Caruso, 135-
pound slugger, of the Pitt
boxing team, ‘who will throw
himself and his Panther team-
mates to the Lions Saturday
evening ‘in a match at State

"College. Caruso, who has been
the hard-luck man on the Pitt
team, ﬁnally received the judges
assent last week against Catho-
lic U. He will have his ﬁsts full
this week as the Panthers strive
for their ﬁrst victory over State.

tion of their last home stand.

According to all the rules of
logical prediction, the Dukemen
are something of a set-up or
warm-up scrimmage for the Pitt-
Tech battle, three days hence. The
Pitts can retain theicity cup by
merely copping one of these two
games. .

. STILL RATE LOCALLY

‘Although -the- Blue and Gold
basketballers were booted out of
the Eastern Conference race by
Temple, the leaders, and George-
town this past week-end, and have
displayed anything but big-league
form, the task that confronts
them this week is comparatively
easy. The Jungle Cats are still
the top players, locally.

Dr. Carlson’s club experienced
little diﬁiculty in setting back the
Bluffmen and Scotchmen earlier
in the season, and stand well to
breeze through tonight’s contest,
at least. Tech will be considera-
bly tougher, despite the glaring
fact that they were trounced by
the Dukes several days ‘ago.

Team 'i‘ravels
To Kent State

sou trying for their ﬁrst win,
the Pitt wrestlers will travel to
Kent State Teacher’s College Sat-
urday night to take on the power-
ful State grapplers.

The Kent staters are riding
high on the crest of a streak of 32
consecutive victories. Their most
recent win was over Michigan,
26-6.,‘

Ed Mazeski, Pitt coach, is ex-
pecting the most trouble in the
118, 126, 135, and heavyweight
classes. The only reason he’s not
expecting a battle in the other di-
visions is that he knows litttle
about the State representatives in
those weights.

Both Strohl and Doan, State 118
and 126 pounders, are better
than average men. Strohl is the
fourth tough opponent to face Bill
Hoeveler this year, and Bill isn’t
counting on grabbing his ﬁrst win.
Rudy Tommarelli, Panther cap-
tain, will face Doan, and Coach
Mazeski is banking on a Pitt vic-
tory.

markably good college wrestler,

was conspicuously ‘demonstrated
in the Stanford-Duquesne clash,
when Hank Luisetti and his
sharpsooters made the bucket
cough up 92 points. The slightly
talented Bluifmen didn’t ease oﬁ
for a moment, even though they
realized that there wasn’t the
fainstest possibility of catching up
to the dead-eye Coast outﬁt. They
died (to coin the phrase) gal-
lantly.

The probable starting lineup
for Duquesne tonight, will be, Co-
captains Fortney, and O’Malley,
and Weitzel, Yankitis, and Kreil-
ing. Dr. Carlson’s regular senior
ﬁve remains unchanged. Captain
Johnson, Zeleznik, Garcia, Spot-
ovich, and Radvansky, will open
Pitt’s final home game. i

FROSH TANGLE

In the preliminary game this
evening Dr. Paul Zehfuss’ strong
freshmen quintet will clash with
what appears to be a much strong-
er Duquesne ﬁrst year outﬁt. In
the ﬁrst meeting between these
two ﬁves, the Dukes won running
away. But, there was the point
then that it was only the opening
game for the Panthers while the
Donnellimen had undergone a few
matches.

Teammates Matched

Olson Replaces Postponed Relays
With Intra-Squad Meet

"Coach Olson will take advantage of the West Virginia meet
postponement and run his track men through their paces in an
intersquad meet at the track house next Saturday. And from

the ‘general state ofthe team,
pace running to lift themselve
will mean a good showing in the
looming IC4A meet in New York.

Two weeks hence part of the
team will make the season’s third
trip to New York for the IC4A,
and the intersquad meet will fur-
nish the trackmen an opportun-
ity to qualify for the Manhattan
trip. Olson has less than two
weeks of training for the IC4A,
and the team has yet to make a
showing in competition.

Insuﬂicient training and poor
physical condition are the explan-
ations, and Olson is tired of ex-
plaining. Every position on the
traveling squad is open, and fast
time on Saturday is as good as a
ticket to New York.

This year’s team isn’t a good
indoor team. In both the Mﬂl—
rose games and NYAC games the
Panthers had trouble running the
boards. Used to the dirt and cin-
der footing or the track house,
they had a difficult time becom-

they’ll have to do some hectic
s to the physical condition that

ing acclimated to Madison Square
Garden’s boarded track.

Johnny Woodruff didn’t run the
half mile last Saturday and will
not try the 600-yard run in the
IC4A. Johnny did anchor the re-
lay team and his quarter mile
jaunt was good enough to -make
up a chunky deﬁcit and bring the
Pitt relay team a second place.

J ohnny’s next crack at the in-
door half mile will be the Cen-
tral Intercollegiates at South
Bend. Until then he will concen-
trate on the anchor spot of the
relay team.

Pitt is the holder of the outdoor
IC4A Championship, but the pos-
sibility of adding the indoor
championship is slim-—very slim.
Unless they suddenly hit tip-top
condition, and take a sudden
liking to indoor running, the best
they can hope for is capture of
some ﬁrsts.

“A mbition Realized ’ Says

Record-Breaker Tolmichi

Pitt Hurdler

“I have realized a great am-
bition in setting a new world’s
record tonight.” This state-
ment came from a short, dark-
haired hurdler from Wayne
University, Al 1 a n Tolmich,
after he had set a new world’s
indoor record for the 60-yard
high—hur§:i1es' in"; the New York
Athletic Club games in Madison
Square Garden last Saturday
night.

In breaking the previous mark
of 7.3 seconds held jointly by
Forrest Towns, Olympic champion
from Georgia, and himself, Tol-
mich defeated the best available
ﬁeld of hurdles in the country.
This top-ﬂight ﬁeld included Sam
Allen of Oklahoma, John Dona-
von of Dartmouth, and Towns.

SETS WORLD RECORD

Tolmich climbed uphill in his
last three years of competition un-
til last summer when he became
national outdoor high-hurdling
champion by beating Spec Towns.
That race was ambition number
one realized for the Detroit youth.

His undisputed victory and re-
sultant world record last Saturday
night ﬁlled his other great ambi-
tion; he now holds indoor as well
as outdoor high hurdling suprem-
acy. .

When asked about his school

. ., _

its IIIINII
:4 Initial

   
    
 
   
   
    
 

   
 

work, Tolmich explained that he
is picking up some credits that he
needs for graduation. He has had
three years’ varsity experience at
Wayne, so he is no longer eligible
for undergraduate competition.

TOLMICH A CONTRAST
“I ﬁnd a tough job in trying to
keep in condition. Traveling to
an average of two indoor meets a
week coupled with no competition
to work out with in Detroit makes
it hard at times.”

As a hurdler, the short legged
Tolmich is a paradox. His small
stature belies any hurdling ability.
He started his track work as a
sprinter, then a low hurdler, and
now he has reached a zenith in
high hurdling.

His peculiar style, that of buck-
ing over the bar, coupled with his
superior sprinting ability, stands
as black against white to the long
shanked Towns. His success is a
combination of hard work, clean
living, and ability.

Tolmich is also another of these
candid camera fans.

Southern Tenant
Farmers’ Leader

Talks To Inquiry

By ROBERT ADAIVIS

Portraying the plight of the
poor class of farm workers in
the South, Howard Kester, head
of the Southern Tenant Farm-
ers’ union, described attempts
of the “sharecroppers” to bet-
ter their living conditions in
his talk at Inquiry Forum Mon-
day.

“It is no exaggeration to say
that the South is so different from
the rest of the country that it

might be called a different civili-
zation,” declared Mr. Kester.

Hundreds of thousands of South-
ern farm workers, he asserted, are
living under a “new type of slav-
ery,” more humiliating and devas-
tating in its effects than chattel
slavery.

WEAR FLOUR SACKS

“Not a diet to nourish human
beings, but to nourish pellagra, is
the ‘universal diet’ of the share-
croppers—meal, molasses, and
‘sourbelly.’ The kind of clothes
most of these people wear depends
upon the kind of flour sacks they
are able to get,” he claimed.

Average incomes of the three
poor classes of farm workers,
tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and
day laborers, he related, range
from 312 dollars per year for those
in the best circumstances to 183
dollars per year for the poorer day
workers.

“The true story of folks who
have been crushed below decent
living standards———that’s the story
of ‘Tobacco Road.’ When there is
no hope in life, the J eeters and the
others are developed. On the St.
Francis and White rivers which
are being ﬂooded today, there are
scores of ‘Tobacco Roads.’

PEOPLE WHO STARVE

“In towns on the Mississippi
delta, I could show you things you
won’t have to go to China to see.
I’ve buried many people who have
died of just plain starvation,” said
Mr. Kester.

Ultimate aim of the Southern
Tenant Farmers’ union is “the
restoration of landless men to the
land,” he declared. Population of
most of the larger Southern cities
and of the better agricultural
lands, he continued, is decreasing,
while more people are settling on
the poorer lands, “where nothing
but a subsistence level of living is
possible.”

Immediate aims of the share-
croppers’ organization, explained
the speaker, include the right of
farm workers to buy goods where
they please, instead of at planta-
tion commissaries; easy access to
ﬁrewood; and reduction of pre-
vailing illegal rates of interest.

AIlVIS OF STFU

The STFU also advocates free
textbooks for children; the right to
organize freely; and abolishment
of illegal plantation “scrip,” with
which many workers are paid.

“The South is the most fertile
ﬁeld in this country for dema-
gogues. Many of those people will
follow the man who promises the
moon to get power to satisfy their
own ambitions,” he commented.

“You have seen certain South-
ern leaders who have raised them-
selves on race prejudice. Huey
Long, a man who raised himself
on economic issues, would be a
serious headache to this country
if he were alive today.”

Anti-Japanese Boycott
At Conference Friday

Four University students will
discuss the pro and con of the
Japanese boycott at the Student-
Faculty Association Forum Fri-
day afternoon at 1 o’clock in 24
Cathedral.

Two members of the University
debate squad will take the affirm-
ative side on a discussion of “The
Anti—Japanese Boycott: Pro and
Con.” Opposing them will be two
students attempting to prove the
fallacy of the boycott.

William Stark, C38, debating
squad manager, and Bernard Mc-
Kenna, C39, member of the debat-
ing team, will maintain that the
boycott is justiﬁed. On the other
side of the question will be Joseph
McCloskey. C38, and Donald Da-
mond, C38.

Stark and McKenna, both vet-
erans on the debating squad, are
also members of SFA. McKenna
was general chairman of the Uni-
versity delegation. to the Inter-
collegiate Peace Conference held
yesterday afternoon at Heinz
House. ’

Besides being a columnist for
The News, McCloskey is president
of Pi Tau Phi, honorary scholastic
fraternity. Damond, interested in
history, has been following the
Sino-Japanese conﬂict.

The four speakers at the SFA
Forum will devote part of the
meeting time to answering ques-
tions from the audience. Milton
Lehman, C39, is chairman of the
Forum series.

Panther Here
Or There Or

Someplace

“The Panther Is Here” must go.
That ambiguous statement is real-
ly quite simple—once you know
the facts.

It seems that Thomas Smith, ed-
itor, in a burst of pride and en-

thusiasm, had an enormous
streamer bearing the fateful
words “The Panther Is Here”

hung in The Panther oﬁice. The
fact that no one—especially Smith
—knew just where “Here” was,
made no diﬁerence. It was very
eﬁective. But Smith wasn’t satis-
ﬁed: it had to have more umphll

So until recently (we’ll get to
the climax soon) when you
walked into The Panther oﬂice the
ﬁrst thing that hit you was the
sign “The Panther Is Here” plas-
tered across the top of the win-
dows.

Very effective. So effective
that people looking up at the
eighth ﬂoor saw a white streamer
across the window. Complaints
reached the Building and Grounds
department that above-mentioned
sign was not exactly the highest
form of Gothic decoration.

“The Panther” isn’t “Here” any-
more.

Things Occur
To Prodigal
Colker, ’39

Everythings happens to Bill
Colker, C39. He’s the boy that
fell into three rivers a couple of
issues back. When he sits in a
chair something happens, when he
walks down the street, something
happens, when he sleeps, some-
thing happens, and all he was
doing this time was waiting for
a street car.

Bill stood there and waited for
a street car, and along came these
two suspicious characters. They
wedged him in between them.

The right side fat spoke from
his right side fat mouth, “What
are you doing on the corner so
late?”

One-track Colker replied, “I’m
waiting for a streetcar.” How-
ever the thugs, who had read that
one in magazines, proceeded to
frisk him.

To make a long story short, they
left and there Colker was again———
still waiting for a streetcar. Get-
ting bored with his own company,
Colker called over the newsboy
and bought a paper. The head-
line was: “Police Ordered ‘Shoot
to Kill.’ He began to think real
fast and in an hour decided that
two policemen had taken him to
be a suspicious looking character.

Sposciulitems
 By Ann Whippo

No sooner do the fraternity boysé

ﬁnish up one round of initiations
than they begin looking for more
recruits. It’s a vicious circle,
methinks! This week-end they
will begin corralling second semes-
ter freshmen into the ranks with
a dizzy list of rushing activities.

Before you are swept up in the
rush, here are a few ﬁnal names
to add to those recently-turned
active, along with sundry other
odds and ends.

 

Phi Delts Present

Gifts To Honor Guests

Marking back to last Saturday
night when the Phi Delts honored
Mr. and Mrs. Carl Distelhorst at
their house dance, we learn that
the honor guests were presented
with gifts of jewelry by the broth-
ers. Mr. and Mrs. Wing and Mr.
and Mrs. Dale Schroedel also were
entertained as guests.

Latest initiation rites at the Phi
Delt house increased their total of
new men to 15 for this year. Fred

Schafer, Robert Black, Arthur
Todd, - Paul Chandler, Lester
Gregg, Andrew Cox, and Judd

Poffenberger are all the way in
and no longer just pledges.

In a homemade boat, young Buzz Holmstrom shoved off last
fall to do what no man ever did before: run the Colorado

meant death by drowning or slow starvation. Here is the
