football game.

Considerable interest has been shown in the reasons
which led the police to disperse the student parade which
was held last Friday, November 7, prior to the Pitt-Tech
Conﬂicting opinions have been expressed, on
the one hand that the students were guilty of disorder along
the ‘line of march, and on the other hand that the police were
guilty of employing oversevere riot methods when. there was
no occasionfor anything of the kind. Investigation has dis-
closed that the students secured_a.permit for the parade;
that the police superintendent signed the permit but neg-
lected to read it or note the line of march and consequently
failed to notify the police along the route; that several com-
plaints of disorder along the line of march had been tele-
phoned to the police operator who inquired from the super-
intendent’s office if a permit had been issued for the parade
and was told, through error, that no permit had been issued;
that the police operator then issued instructions to the offi-
cers to break up the parade; that the student marshal did
not have the permit with him when challenged by the police
officers; that the officers used riot methods in dispersing the
parade when such methods were unnecessary.

Following are given the facts of the occurrence in chro-

of today's paper.

2. Supt. Walsh admitted to
Clothier that he had authorized the permit but had signed it
without‘ reading its provisions and had not notiﬁed any of the
police along the line of march of the proposed parade and had
not taken steps to provide a police escort.

3. Emanuel Fishkin, student chairman in charge of the pa-
rade, asked the Oakland police station for a police escort and
was told by the officer in charge that none would be necessary,
adding that provisions would be made by the traffic department.

nological order, as ascertained in conferences with Dean Clo-
thier and Director of Public Safety James M. Clark:

1. A permit for the parade was secured from Peter P.
Walsh, Superintendent of Police, the permit designating the line
of march from Fifth avenue to Smithﬁeld street to Grant street.
The permit was issued from the office of the Superintendent,
October 31. A facsimile of this permit appears in another part

Director Clark and Dean

4. Complaints that students were damaging property along
Fifth avenue, pulling street car trolleys off wires and breaking
car windows were turned in to police operators. According to po-
lice, a total of 15 complaints was registered, the.Pittsburgh Rail-
ways Company being the chief complainant for police action.

5. Checking up with the office of the Superintendent where
apparently no.record had been kept of the permit, the police op-
erators then issued orders to the oﬁicers of the_ District No. 2
station to break up the parade. Oﬁicers halted the line of march
at the intersection of Fifth avenue and Chatham street.

6. According to William Daufenbaugh. assistant to the dean

Photograph of Parade Permit

 

Above is a photographic reproduction of the original permit for the pep parade of last Friday,

obtained by Emanuel Fishkin,_ chairman of the parade committee, on Oct. 31.

The photograph shows

that the permit was signed by both Supt. of Police Walsh and Director of Public Safety Clark. The

permit also designated the route of the parade through downtown streets.

Walsh has admitted that

he signed the license without reading its provisions and says the parade was broken up because of dis-
order on the part of the students. Students deny that they were disorderly until stopped by police.

Owl Drive To
Start Monday

Ben Weisman, Col. '33, Named
Sorority Contest I-read '

 

Under the direction of Ben Weis-
man, Col. '33, newly appointed soror-
ity contest manager, the Owl sorority
contest will get- under way at the
beginning of next ‘week. Letters
assigning a fraternity to each soror-
ity will be mailed on Monday and
upon their receipt the various
sororities will immediately begin
their subscription campaign. _

However, the coeds will not_be
limited to their assigned fraternities.
They may canvass the entire student
body, with the exception of seniors,
who purchased their Owls last week.

The winning sorority will receive
the coveted hundred dollar Xrize.
Last year it was won by the lpha
Phi Delta sorority, which sold sev-
enty-ﬁve copies of the Owl, far out-
distancing all other competitors.

Until last year the Owl was s on-
sored primarily by the junior c ass,
but last year, as a bridge between
the junior and senior year-books, it
was an all-class publication contain-
ing the pictures of members of
campus fraternities and sororities.
Beginning with the coming issue the
Owl will be a senior year—book, fea-
turing the picture and descriptive
paragraph of each member of the
senior class.

uel Fishkin, chairman of the com-
mittee in charge of the demonstra-
tion. Fishkin is expected to lay be-
fore the governing group a formal

quainted with eople.

M-argaret Reinherr, feature editor
of the Pitt Weekly, has also been in-
vited.

‘Y’ Campaign‘
Totals $3, 100

Faculty Pledge $900; Men
Lack $200 Of Goal

 

With over ..$3,100 as total esti-
mated returns toward _their joint
$3,800 goal, the Y. W. and Y. M-
A. end their official campaigns. Up
to date, Y. W. C. A. reports show a

student return of $490, with the d

pledge of faculty,_ alumnae, and
friends . amounting to $710; this
brings them: within $300 of their
$1,500 goal.

For the men’s organization, stu-
dent pledges have mounted to $1,200,
incligiinzg the large purses which the
schools of dentistry and pharmacy
always contribute each year; their
faculty committee‘ solicitors, head-
ed by J. G. Quick, at their ﬁnal
meeting yesterday, completed the
faculty pledge of $900, bringing Y.
M. returns within $200 of their
$2,300 goal.

Approach Goal Set

According to both ﬁnance chair-
men, Corolla Orcutt, Ed. ’31, and
William Gettys, Bus. Ad. ’31, the
additional contributions which are ex-
pected within the _next few days will
probably place the campaign returns
very near to their original goals.
A $400 increase in the budgets of the
two organizations this yearmay be
partial reason or failure, so far, in
attaining their goals.

The funds received during the an-
nual drives ﬁnd divers channels:
support to Ling-nan University in
Chga, salary of a student secretary
in uenos-- Aires, aid tosocial cen-
ters, banquets and programs during
the year. The budgets were raised
this year primarily because of the
big project of World Education In-
stitute which both men and women
will sponsor in bringing leaders in
educational and religious world» to
the campus for class talks and open
forums.

Sage Opens Lectures

Irivestigations Reveal Facts Of Parade Distuiibaincen

lof men, the officers demanded to see the permit which Fishkin
§ had neglected to bring with him. Suggestions that the granting
‘of the permit be conﬁrmed by telephone were refused by the
3 oﬁicers who demanded to see it in “black and white.”

said “the police had at no time exceeded their authority and
broke the parade up because of disorderly action on the part.
of the students and not because the chairman was unable
to produce his permit when it was demanded.”

Scrutiny of these facts leads to the judgment that no
disturbance would have been caused if the students had re-
frained, from even the slightest disorder. along the line of’
march, or if the superintendent’s office had handled the per-
mit with its usual efficiency or if the police officials had been

able to distinguish. between a situation when good-natured , I.
warning would have been adequate and one in which dras- , _ ,

tic methods are necessary.

A deﬁnite conclusion from the developments of the pep '
parade is that in view of the increasingitraffic in the down- _
town street and the likelihood that students will engage in
small disorder along the lines of march, and the fact that «
the Pittsburgh police department is not organized to distin-

guish between minor disorders

orders requiring riot methods, parades in the downtown sec-_   4
tion of the city should be discouraged in the future.

Rush P_r_ogram

Frats Have ‘Until 5
'O’Clock Today To
Submit Bids

H  ofcloclg this morning ended a_
mad round of luncheons, dances and
smokers and another Pitt fraternity

C, rushing period was phst history.

Fraternities have until 5- o’clock
this evening to submit bids’ to the
can of men, who will, as soon as
possible, make appointments with
the students receiving bids. Their
choice will then be registered.

Due to the removal of pledge re-
quirements, more than three hun-
dred bids, a» greater number than
have ever been received at any one
time in the past, are expectd to be
received by the dean of men's ofiice,
according to Theodore W. Biddle,
assistant to the dean of men.

Simultaneous with the conclusion
of the rushing period a silence
period began, during which time fra-
ternity men are forbidden to con-
verse with any freshman.

At any time during this period,
which ends at 5 o’clock on the -after-
noon of Thursday, November 20,
freshmen receiving bids may make
known their choices in the. office of
the dean of men.

Then Frats Pledge

At the conclusion of the silence
period the pledges-to-be will meet
representatives of their respective
fraternities at the office of the dean
of men. Pledging ceremonies and
fraternity dinners will follow.

.A feature of the-rushing period
just concluded was that all qualiﬁca-
tions, notably the scholastic require-
ment of twelve credits and twelve
quality points, were removed, mak-
ing every student in the University
eligible for ledging.

However, efore “a pledge can be
initiated he must have earned twelve
credits and twelve quality points
and should he fail to accomplish this
in the semester following his pledg-
ing he surrenders his pin and be-
comes ineligible for further pledging
until he has met these requirements.

A second innovation in this year's
rushing period was its early occur-
rence. Previously, deferred rushing
seasons occurred at the beginning of
the second semester, but on the peti-
tion of several fraternities last
spring, the period was scheduled to
take place from November 7 to 15,
and later was moved up still further
on account of the game with Ohio
State.

Avinoffi Gives
Talk On Tour

Faculty Wives Hear Plan To
Aid Inactive Women

 

 

Dr. Andrey Avinoff, director of
Carnegie Museum and professor of
ﬁne arts inthe University, gave an
illustrated lecture on “Rambling
Reminiscences of Europe,” before
members of the Woman's Associa-
tion, Wednesday afternoon. Dr. Av-
inoif made a tour of Europe last
summer, studying the European mu-
seums.

Dr. Avinoif’s itinerary began in
Cardiff, Wales, where he attended a
conference of the re resentatives of
English museums. T en he went to
London, where he went through the.
British Museum; Oxford and Cam-
bridge, where he said “the survival
of traditional scholasticis-in was sim-
pressive.”

He next showed scenes of

Antwerp, and the International Ex-
hibition now in progress there; then
Bruges, Ghent and Brussels. Dr.
Avinoif described the beauty of the
Gothic cathedrals in these cities. and
the feelin of age they convey. Then
came Ber in, which, in spite of the
war, has lost none of its sumptuous-
ness and grandeur. He showed scenes
of Dresden, Vienna, Leipzig, Prague
and Saltzburg, with their old-worl
charm; then Munich,tthe home of the
German museum, the greatest in the
world.
VA Throughout his talk, Dr. Avinoil.
emphasized the solemmty and glori-
ﬁcation of science portrayed in Eu-
ropean museums. He. expressed
the opinion that some_o_f the dis-
plays were more appealing to, the
scientists, thatito the general pub-
lic, because of the. abundance of de-
tail in the exhibits.

Hear Activity H Talk

In keeping‘ with the ‘plans of the
Woman’s Association to bring the
students and faculty into a closer re-
lationship with .each other,’ Anne
Kuhar, Bus.‘ Ad. '32, spoke to th
Association on “Activities.” *

Miss Kuhar- explained that ~ the
Women’s Self-Government Associa-
tion is making plans this «year which
will hel , women who have difficulty
in" getting "started in activities. *
new system ‘of cata1ogingthe,names

Quill Calls F or Prose Talent
As Free Verse Poets Flood
Literary Field Completely

What’s.wrong with all the as-
piring authors and playwrights?
Of all the manuscripts submitted
to the Quill Club there has been
no prose, all poetry-free and un-

‘ conventional in style at that. The
question is, why?

The poetry is reminiscent of ex-
periences of the past. The present
has no concern for these poets, the
past is far more interesting and
alluring. Of course, things that
are ended and gone are seen more
clearly and appreciated more
acutely than the glaring horrid
present.

. Another thing, where are the
playwrights? As far as it is
‘ known there has never been a
play submitted. Here is a chance
to realize an ambition. Secretly,
everyone has wished at one time
.. or another to write a play--—here
’ is your chance.
. Every one has had experiences
that_have seemed very interesting
. to him. Why not try putting them
on paper? Who knows but what
this may be just the chance to
start to developing the dormant
talent. . ‘

We invaded the Panther oﬁice to
discover why some of our very

Panther sobbing at his desk.

“Aha!” we said wisely, “Cher-

“No,” sobbed the Panther,
“you’ve got your numbers mixed.

 

It’s not the woman, it's the
women.
“Awa!” we exclaimed, “then

your case is hopeless.”

“Yes,” he answered as he
choked on another lemon drop,
the women seem to think this is
an exclusively male publication.
They’ve deserted us. We want
more women writers on the Pan-

to write forius we'll give you a

that debating contributes some things to the experience of a col-
lege girl that no other actiivty can give her. _ . _

“Naturally, you would expect me to be prejudice_d,_” says Miss
Kuhn, “but I really think that debating dt”/91995 qualities in astu-
dent that might never ﬁnd expression otherwise. To stand before a
critical audience and reason out a reply to a point that has been
contested certainly develops poise. A debat_or learns to be alert and

, accurate. To consider both sides of 8 q}19St10n and W_e1gl1 each thor-
oughly develops a keen reasoning ability. Debate stimulates _an in-
tellectual curiosity that is valuable not only in debating but in out,-

“Here at Pitt, our policy of_ extension; and collegiate debates

similar. Every girlwho has debated with a team from another col-

“If women are to take an active _

Bowman Stresses Note
Of Conservatism That
Has Developed

 

Meeting in an atmosphere of good
will and mutual co-operation, 18
foreign students representing 13 na-
tionaiities, together with members
of the University administration and
representatives of campus activities,
were entertained by the committee
on foreign students at the third an-
nual International dinner, Wednes-
day evening. Chancellor John G.
Bowman and Dr. S. B. Linhart, sec-
retary to the University, were honor
guests at this dinner which was
held in Heinz House.

- Talks expressing the objective of
foreign students in studying in Amer-
ican universities and the differences
in student life among the various
nationalities of th. world were given
by Chancellor Bowman, Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women; Rev. Bern-
ard Golawski, a Polish student in
the gradaute school. Miss Gertrude
Luning, also a foreign student;
Hermine Ruoif, president of Mortar
Board. and Charles A. Seidle, chair-
man of student relations commit-
tee of Student Council.

Chancellor Bowman stressed the
conservatism that has developed
throughout the world after a period
of war hysteria and said that na-
tions were attempting a mutual un-
derstanding as indicated by greater
number of foreign students enrolled
each year in American universities.
He said that no student could be
called a “foreign student” who
grasped the true signiﬁcance of
education.

Student Speaks

“We have dedicated ourselves to
service for our own people and come
to American universities to fit our-
selves for this service because we
desire to gain the advantages of
American life, democracy which are
open to the American student,” said
Rev. Golawski, speaking on the
“Foreign Student’s Objective in the
American University.”

Miss Amos, as the _ﬁrst speaker
on the program, struck the purpose
for. which the Foreign Student Com-
mittee at Pitt was formed by saying
that “Men exist for one another; let
us teach them and bear with them.”

Miss Lunning spoke on_“Student
Life in. Foreign Universities." Her-
mine Ruoﬁ’ addressed the guests on
“Student Life at the -University of
Pittsburgh” and Charles Seidle se-

lected “Participation in Student
Life’? as his topic.

What s dilerence one blocked kick
makes! Given the inspiration of
having tied the score it is not be-
yond the bounds of possibility that
Carnegie could have ummoned the
punch needed to win the game in the
ﬁnal few moments of play last Sat-
urday.‘ As it was, Pitt adherents
were compelled to sit through long
minutes of awful suspense. Many
students were physically tired at the
end of the game from the nervous
strain. Many, with their costs off
on a cool day, set bathed in a cold
sweat. Time and again as the ‘lance-
like thrusts of the Tech backs shat-
tered against an impregnable Pitt
defence, an audible sigh of ' relief
rose from the Panther cheering sec-
tion. Watching the Pitt-Tech game
was like seeing a highly dramatic
play in which the action rises to cli-
max after climax with the ﬁnal fate
of the actors in doubt until the ﬁnal
curtain.

Once again last’ Saturday, the Pitt
cheering section came through with
a classy, spirited‘ performance. ' It
is easy to cheer ateam or cause on
to the attack, but it takes real de-
votion to hail a stout defense.
There's nothing very spectacular
about it, just a steady resistance,
but what a hard" job it is to do it!!
Sometimes when the cheerleaders
became so engrossed in the game
they forgot to lead a yell, one was
given anyway, spontaneously.

Cheering section displays with col-
ored cords or paper have become an
expected part of every big game.
The Tech section is organized rath-
er elaborately. Every student in
the section dons a white oilcloth
cape so that a bright white back-
ground is formed for the red letters
formed by red cards. By a prear-
ranged system of seating. it is pos-
sible to form three letters, “C,” “I,”

and “T,” instcadof the sin'glel“C” Y

possible in the Pitt section. The
cards used by the Tech rooters, how-
ever. are not a deep enough red, and
at a distance look more ‘like pink.
The crepe-paper used in the Panther
section is more vivid and easier to
handle. . ’ *

Probably the hardest work in the
Stadium is done after the game is
over. We mean the cleaning, up.
Thousands of newspapers, peanut
shells, broken bottles, cigarette
packages, candy bar wrappers, and

a hundred’ other forms of debris are .

left in the wake of the crowd.

While most undergraduates of the
University received a holiday in
celebration of the victory the stu-
dents in the Medand Dental Schools
were required to attend classes as
usual last-Monday. And yetthey
areythe most rabid fans. Why is it?
By the way, we have a sneaking
suspicion that we got Monday, off
as an assurance against further
riots. The police were taking things
entirely too seriously for the wel-
fare of the students. When’ the ﬁre
department got out ./a hose to stop
the parade last Friday somebody
had the nerve to protest that it was

Render Service To Members
at ‘k 1: it 1|:

Obtained From. Fraternities

 

By ROBERT c.,cLoTnmR
Dean of Men
During the next few days many

members of the freshman class will
be giving serious consideration to

the matter of fraternity membership.
Many will be trying to ﬁnd the
answer to the question: Shall I join
a fraternity if I have the opportu-

nity? ‘Others will be trying to ﬁnd

the answer to the question: Which

fraternity shall I join‘?

.. some universities fraternities
are regarded by the university ad-
ministration with thinly-veiled hos-
tility, others with indifference. ‘_At
Pittsburgh we believe, the fraternity
has a valuable service to render In
stimulating its members and giving

practical assistance in fulﬁlling best

the purposes: for which they have
From this point_of
viewthe fraternity which maintains
standards of scholarship and ethics.
and insists upon their observance, is
strengthening the hand of the _unI-
versity itself in helping the indi-

vidual student achieve the utmost of
which he is capable.

Yet no one can answer these-two
questions without serious thought.

Not every man, for instance, should
join a fraternity. Ordinarily a fra-
ternity is a group of men of con-
genial tastes and similar ideals of
conduct who live together in com-
fortable surroundings and enjoy the
inspiration which that kind of fel-
lowship affords. Unless~a student
who is considering joining a frater-
nity feels that in addition to proﬁt-
ing from such a fellowship he can
contribute to it, he should not join
a fraternity. The strength of a fra-
ternity depends upon the aggres-
siveness with which each member
maintains the ideals for which it
stands. . ’ _

The student who is contemplating
joining a fraternity should think of
it not only from the point of view of
the beneﬁts he will derive,‘ but f_I-om
the point of view of the responsibil-
ity he wlllassume.

It is equally true that a. man who
fails to join a. fratermtyﬁvhere such
standards as these prevail, loses one
of his great opportunities at college.
Every studentfs mam purpose _lies, or
should lie, within the curriculum.
Everything else is secondary to that
main purpose and should be Iﬂade to
serve it. If a man is wise enough to
choose a fraternity which is proud
of its standards and jealous_of its
scholarship, his membership In that
fraternity will make it easier for him
to fulﬁl this main purpose.

Important as this aspect of the
matter is, there are other beneﬁts
whichta man derives from joining a.
fraternity of this type. The values
he will receive in cultural develop-
ment and social presence and in
stimulating fellowship are values
which I cannot be over-estimated.
Furthermore, he will develop per-
sonal friendships which will last as
long as he lives and which will be oi‘
value to him not only in college but
after he graduates in business as
well as in social life.

Seniors Disagree On Value
Of New Sophomore Plan

 

Sophomore cus_tom’s committee
has assisted senior mentors with
their groups this year for the first
time. Although theoretically the
plan was considered» an excellent
one, it has failed to meet the re-

either senior or sophomore girls.

_ whether ibis the fault of the girls

who tried‘ it out this year, or‘ wheth-
er the plan itself is not feasible has
not yet beenidetermined. There has
been quite a difference Oi 0Pm1°,“
among the ~ment0rs as to Itsrpossr

“I have found,” says ' Margaret L

“It might be a good thing,” said
Hermine Ruoif. “but certainly, It

The Varsity and Freshman cross-

season last Saturday with a double
win over Carnegie Tech. The Var-
sity won by the score of 25-80, and
the Freshmen won by the perfect
score of 15-40. This is the first vic-
tory the Varsity has gained over
Tech in three years. "It was the

the Varsity, Clise, Captain Caesar,

in the order named. For the Frosh,
Captain'Eisenbart, Watkins, Platt
and Lawrence ﬁnished in that or-

The Varsity had a fair season,
winning from Allegheny and Car-
negie, "and losing to Ohio State.
Syracuse and Pe.nn State. Clise and
Captain Caesar were outstanding
for'Pitt' all season.’ Clise took first
in all meets except one and in that
one he was second. Caesar, the
onlysenior on the team, closed four
years» of competition with a num-
ber of places close to‘ the vileaders.
The Freshman team, was one of
the best Pitt has had in. a long time.
They emerged victorious over Alle-

Dan Butler, manager of the team
this year, said in regard to the past
season, “All infall, the season was

60,000 Fans Will Watch  
Strong Defensive Squadssil 
In Columbus Tomorrow

_ Following a short workout on the practice ﬁeld this morn-
ing, the Pitt varsity football team will board a train .for-.Co-
lumbus where tomorrow afternoon they will face Coach:Sa1n
‘Wil1aman’s Ohio State Buckeyes, considered one of the strong
est defensive. teams in the country. , , “
Both teams are fresh from hard—earned victories last

 

  
  
  
   
  
  
    
   
    

urday and each will be outtomor-'
row to make it two in a row.
When the two teams met here
last year, Pitt’s team with its ﬁve
all-Americans romped off with an
18-2 triumph. The Buckeye team
was composed mostly of sophomores

and juniors while the Pitt boys who
started the game last year were for
the main part seniors.

The Buckeye eleven, however, lost
more men during the summer than
it had reckoned upon. About ﬁve
of the boys quit school to play base-
ball in V. the Mid-Atlantic league
while several others were lured
away from Columbus by other
schools, Geneva as usual being one
of these schools. 1

Strong Defense

Sam vwillaman was not discour-
aged by this fact and he has worked
hard with his men who‘ instead of
presenting a- makeshift lineup have
as strong a defensive team as one
can ﬁnd anywhere.

Northwestern and Michigan were
the only two teams to score upon
Buckeyes this
western" is ranked along with Notre
Dame and Southern Californians
the three strongest teams in the
country while Michigan, mainly‘
through the brilliance of their quar-
terback, Harry , Newman, has not
lost a gamethis season.

Pitt, likewise, is very strong de-
fensively, but two teams’, Notre
Dame. and Carnegie Tech having
scored on it allseason. Pitt oppo-
nents have scored 41 points against
the Panthers in seven games while
the Ohio State. team has had 32
points put on the ‘wrong side of the
ledger in six games.

The oifense of both teams is noth-
ing for their partisanfollowers to
“write home about,” even though
the Panthers have averaged 23
points per game while the Buckeyes
have an average. score of 19 points

Health Bureau Asks
For Old Spectacles

Any worn-out spectacles today,
lease? Do you have any old frames
uried in the bottom of some
drawer around the house? It’s not
the Junk man who’s asking you, it’s
the Health Department.

There is a real use for any frames
that you can resurrect, according
to ‘Dr. Marion Shepard. She ex-
plains that there are many women
in school who are in desperate need
of glasses, but who cannot afford to
Day the _usual high prices for an
examination, lenses and frames.
With a certiﬁcate signed by Dr.
Shepard, however, stating that she
15 unable to pay more, a Pitt coed
may have her-_ eyes examined by a
reputable oculist for $5 or less. The
optician will insert the lenses in any
frame that she can secure, and she
will be able to get the badly—n_eeded
glasses for as low as $7.50.

Dr. Shepard has already gath-
"ed “P Several pairs of frames
from her family and from friends,
but she hopes that she is only start-
ing her collection. ~

“So rummage around, and see if

“Oh, do you‘! Now in our frater-
nitypwe did it this way—-." '  .
“On our campus fraternities
were——."

As Pitt women open their ‘‘little
rushing season” today, fraternity

other schools are looking on curi-
ously, and commenting on the nov-
elty of what they see. ‘

And how many views of rushing
they represent! They come from
places where a girl wearing, a pin
grabs your bag and rushes‘ you/to. a
taxi before she tel-ls you her name,
and from places where they look
you over until , May. They have
gone to schools ‘where fraternity
girls hide their pins the first week,
and polishithem‘ up for rushing the
second‘ week,_ and schools where
they postpone the big season until
Easter. '

There are all kinds of fraternity
backgrounds--ﬁve come from other
chapters of fraternities on this
campus, six from local fraternities,
and the rest from national frater-
/nities not represented at Pitt.

Approximately twenty transfers
are fraternity» women, re resenting
ﬁfteen vdiiferent schools. rom tiny
chapters of ﬁfteen members and
huge chapters of sixty, from schools
with dormitories and colleges where
everyone lived in fraternity houses,
they see _with very different eyes.

‘ Pitt More Democratic .

But they all agree on one thing
-—the non-fraternity woman has a
higher rating at Pitt. “The non-
fraternity women did not rate so-
cially nor scholastically as highas
the fraternity women at Westmins-
ter,” observed Edith Roll, member
of a local group there.

They take a great interest in our
new experiment of rushing without
men. About half of them used this
system at _ their former school.
“Rushing without men is best be-
cause it makes the girls in the fra-
ternity the drawing card,” declares
Sara Lillian McClintock, Al ha
Gamma. Delta, from Allegheny 801-
ege.

Jean Muller, Kappa Alpha Theta
from  acuse, believes. that “Rush-
ing wit out men is better, although
they play a more or less active part
anyway.”

Preference for deferred rushing
was almost unanimous, as only four
or ﬁve had used the plan of imme-
diate rushing. 1
Women who lived in fraternity
houses last year speak wistfully of
them. “A house makes a lot of dif-
ference,” says June Miller, Alpha"
Omicron Pi from Northwestern.
“_At Northwestern many of the girls
lived in houses. They had good liv-

Ethel Bell, Phi Epsilon from Kent

Coeds Less Typical .
Are Pitt fraternity women all
one type within the group? _Marie
Wall, Howard College, Washington,
C.; Sara Carten, Westminster,
and Mary. Vitchestain from Wheat-
on College, think that they are less
specialized here,’ than at their for-
mer colle es. ,

But E len Youn , Chi Omega
from Westminster, isagrees. “Fra-
ternit groups are more specialized
here‘ th socially and ‘athletically.
We had smaller groups. but more di-
versiﬁed, with more types of wom-
en.

“At Syracuse, fraternities were
not highly‘ specialized, but there
was more intensity of feeling’, as
everyone lived in houses right on

the 'campus,” was Jean» Muller's .

comment- A . ,

And then there is the size of the
grou to consider. Dorothy Jones,
mem er of a local fraternity
Grove City, believes that larger
groups are better organized and can
get more accomplished. 

Coming from a local chapter, at

Wheaton College in Illinois which

has seventy members, Mary Vitch_es-
tain is convinced that there is great-
er school spirit in a large group.
For the-next few days every coed
who wears a pin she won at some
distant college will be hunting for
the answer to the question on the
tip of her tongue, “How do the
wheels go ’round in a Pitt rushing
season?’ .

Collembola Plans A
Second Field Trip

Leonard Williams, chairman "of
Collembola’s ﬁeld trip committee, is
planning the club’s second ﬁeld trip

of the year to Bedford county. The
expedition will leave Pittsburgh on
Thanksgiving Day immediately fol-
lowing the Pitt-Penn State game.

The club will study the natural
life of the Bedford county moun-
tains for three days, until Sunday
evening when they will return to
Pittsburgh. .

Aimeeting of the club was held.
Thursday evening at Wellesley Hall.
E. M. Porter spoke at this meeting
on the general. subject‘ of astrono-
my. He illustrated his talk with
stereoscope slides, many of which
he obtained for himself.
