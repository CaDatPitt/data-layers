Welfare, YM-YWCA

Wadsworth Drive Head

The second annual Student Chest
drive gets under way Wednesday, No-
vember 7, under the chairmanship of
Homer Wadsworth, C35, with an open-
ing luncheon for workers.

The purpose of the drive -is to
secure funds for the Student Loan
fund, VVeli'are fund, the University
YMCA and YWCA, and Pitt-in-China.
The Student Chest drive will appor-.
tion the total amount received in the
November campaign among the organ-
izations assisting.

Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, and W. ‘W. Mendenhall, ex-
ecutive secretary of the YMCA, have
been chosen as treasurer and secre-
tary of the drive respectively.

During the campaign, workers will
attempt to contact every student on
the campus a.t least once.

The campaign will be conducted
through engineering seminars, Eug-
lish sections, business administration
seminars and by class representatives.
It will take the form of personal
solicitation of students who cannot be
contacted through any particular
agency. All campus fraternities will
join in the campaign in a. per capita
arrangement. Instructors will be asked
to devote three minutes of their class
periods to permit representatives of
the drive to contact their classes.

Other members of the committee
are: Miss Helen Rush, assistant dean
of women, Miss Helen Battrick, sec-
retary of the YWCA, Ellsworth Miller,
representing the Student-Faculty as-
sociation, Janet Slease, representing
WSGA, and Margaret Lehm, Ed36, rep-I
resenting YWCA.

The chairmen for the following di-
visions have been appointed: Fresh-
man English classes, Miss Helen Bat-
trich; sophomore English classes, W.
W. Mendenhall; junior and senior
English classes, Janet Slease; junior
and senior Education’ classes, Mar-
garet Lehm; men’s fraternities, Ells-
worth Miller. The other chairmen will
be appointed shortly. In all, there
will be twelve divisions which in-
clude: School of Business Administra-
tion, women’s fraternities, School of
Medicine, School of Pharmacy, School
of Dentistry and the School of Law.

There will be a parade Wednesday
through the city, sponsored by the
Welfare fund; the YMCA and the
YWCA have been invited to partici-
pate. 1

Swinging Cathedral Stones In Place

Eight Two-Ton Stones Placed On

Rigging For Job Hardestv
Part Of Work 500 Feet
Above Campus

Five hundred. feet above the ter-
raced lawn of the -Cathedral, eight
large stones weighing. two tons_apiece
have been raised into place on the
peak of the tower, They are virtu-
ally the last stones to be set.

To the average student, placing
such la.rge stones on a practically
open platform more than 500 feet from
the ground would appear a difficult
job. But. according to E, McClain.
superintendent of the building and
grounds department, the hardest part
was not the setting of the stone but
getting equipment for the work up
there. »

The chief obstacle was the hand
powered rig used to swing the stones
into position. for the stone-setters,
The 30 foot boom of the rig had to
be brought up a narrow construction
elevator shaft, then set up on the
roof. Vvorking with the stones would
have been more simple had it been
possible to bring a larger boom for

Fine Arts I-lead Admires Prize

Winner; Notes Serious Tone

“Of course everyone has a right to
express his own op-inion whether he
is fully qualiﬁed or not,” said Walter
H. Hovey, professor and acting head
of the ﬁne arts department, when
questioned as to his feeling toward
the numerous wise cracks circulating
at the expense of the "prize winners
at the International Art exhibition.

“But,” Mr. Hovey continued, “no

one should prepare to pronounce his
opinions after only one inspection of
the exhibit, He should visit it again
and again. At the ﬁrst approach, he
should free himself entirely from any
intellectual analysis of the paintings
and should look at them with the de-
sire to enjoy them. After he gets the
full emotional appeal, then he can an-
alyze the paintings and let his in-
tellect decide what he thinks of them.
Otherwise, he will lose most of the
pleasure in viewing the exhibit.”

Mr. Hovey said that he, personally,
admired the ﬁrst prize award, “South
of Scranton.” He considered it one of
the most original conceptions in the
entire show, and the fact that it stim-
ulates a desire to interpret it is
evidence that it is a worthy piece of
work. ,

“The show as a whole,” said Mr.
Hovey, “reflects a certain seriousness
and lack of joy in life, which might
be expected in view of the recent
years of depression. The marked lack
of pleasant landscapes is an indica-
tion of this seriousness of purpose and
struggling to interpret social life.”

Student Health Service

A bulletin placing a restriction upon
applications for sick excuses has been

A sick excuse for more than one
day’s absence is granted only within
two days after the returnof the stu-
dent to school.

The excuses will be issued only
after consultation with a Student
I~Ic-alth doctor, or upon" the statement
of the attending physician.

Employment Sags,
Living Costs Rise

Business Review Reports Decline
In Financial Failures

With industrial activity failing to,
show gain in production, the Pitts-
burgh Business Review published to-
day by the Bureau of Business Re-
search, sees the continuation of active
retail trade as the’. most encouraging
aspect of current business.

Employment decreased by six-
tenths of one per cent, showing near-
ly_ eight per cent more people em-
ployed for September than in the same
period last year and nearly 20 per
cent more than in the same period
of 1932. The greatest decrease was
noticed in the steel works and the
rolling mills. Department stores in-
creased employment 19 per cent since
August.

Fiiiaucial conditions ‘ﬁll somewhat,
better than last year, with three com-2
mercial failures reported. This is the'
smallest number in any month but
one in the last ﬁve years. The ag-
gregate sales of Pittsburgh life in-'
surance also are better, exceeding by
16 per cent those of the same nine-
month period last year.

Prices and the cost of living rose
steadily and are higher now than in
any month since January. 1931. The
rise over August in farm products
has been ﬁve per cent, in raw ma-
terials, three and one—fourth per cent,
and in foods, three per cent.

Retail food prices in the United
States ha.ve arisen nine per cent in
the last year and more than 28 per
cent since February, 1933. Pittsburgh
rises have approximated national ﬁg-
ures.

“New Deal” In Program

At a dinner meeting in the Kappa
Sigma fraternity house tomorrow
Druids, sophomore honorary

planning a “new deal” for the current
year. ’l‘he llrogram of action, which
in the past has been on a point scale,
will be changed to contain the aims
of the organization in a more general
form. The initiation procedure may
also be revised.

Van _ Ormer has announced the
following committee chairmanships:
ritual committee, Gordon Rauck, C37; }

ChemistsWant Russian-
English Translator

‘The department of chemistry
should be wholly in favor of the
movement to add Russian to the
University curriculum, as a result
of an incident which happened
last week.

The department received notice
several weeks ago of an important
article entitled “The theory and
practice of the production of se-
lenium rubies,” by I. I, Kitaigorsd-
skii. Dr. Alexander Silverman,
head of the department, who is in-
terested in this subject, immedi-
ately sent for the article. When
the article came lastweek, Dr.
Silverman was surprised to ﬁnd
it written in Russian,

Unfortunately, none of the pro-
fessors in the department could
read it.

The chemistry faculty is rapidly
becoming distraught trying to ﬁnd
some solution to this perplexing
situation, Any student or faculty
member who is capable of trans-
lating Russian into English is
asked to report to Room 304,
Thaw hall, immediately.

Students And Machine Guns

THE STUDENTS of Latin America are on the
march. ,
Nothing is more signiﬁcant in the countries. to

the south of us, according to an important article

by Carleton Beals and Earle James in the Yale

Review, than the rise of the various student inove-

ments to national importance. The students have

“ﬂung themselves into battle for their aspirations

and for the recreation of their respective father-

l.ands.” “They carry guns; they organize; they
bring new ideas and ideals; they are writing a new

‘literature, painting new pictures and shaking-down

governments.’ ’

North Americans are somewhat familiar with
the political preoccupation of Latin American stu-
dent groups through their seizure.of power last
year in Cuba, when the Gran Martin regime took
power for a while, or until the withholding of
United States recognition made that regime impos-
sible. Occasioiially Puerto Rican students have
clashed with some hard-breathing United States
governor there. But these phenomena are puzzling
to North Americans who visualize an undergrad-
uate enthusiasm as a football game or a beer bust.
A student grimly pumping a machine gunis a
bizarre picture. Active participation in political
affairs impresses us as callow and uncalled for.

Beals and James assert that student revolt is “a
continental expression” in Latin America, and that
it has begun as “mere campus insurgency.” As
far back as 1900 the Latin American student found
himself dissatisﬁed with his university, which not
only retained the antiquated curricula_of scliolas-
ticisin but which had become a dumping. ground
for lanie-duck politicians.‘ Thus the original stu-
dent inoveinent in Latin America was to maintain
better standards of scholarship, standards which
were at least somewhat in evidence in the United
States.

The coiiﬂict, as the Yale Review article sees it,
was between a static, traditional instruction and a
volatile new social order. Society was being re-
shaped by industry and capitalism, while the state
and the university were clinging to ecclesiastical
and colonial traditions. Barred in their attempts
to reconstitute the universities, Latin American
students turned to the reconstitution of the state as
a first measure. Raising the cry of, “Youth to
work! Old men to the tomb!” Latin American
students have since become the world ’s best exam-

ple of a.n independent student movement for po-_

litical purposes, as differentiated from the more
clearly government-fashioned student movements
of contemporary Europe.

HY, COMMENTATORS like t.o ask, should stu-

dents everywhere but in the United States
have active political purposes which they seek to
serve through common action? The question is
:not so much to the point any more, of course.
American students have maintained an interest in

iiiatioiial and international politics about propor-

tional to their elders’ interests, and their elders are
ibecoiiiiiig more cosinopolitan-minded. Yet there is
a differeiice in the ideologies of North and South
American students. Beals and James suggest a
number of reasons: the early physical iiiatiirit-3’ Of
Latins, the relatively large proportion of the liter-
ate population which students to the south rep-
resent, aiid the state ownership of universities,
causing them to be sharp training grounds of pol-
itics. The genesis, however, and the propelling
forc.c has been the contradiction between existing
social regimes and the maturing new society of iii-
dustry and international capitalism. Tradition
and change in Latin America.

A “New Deal” in all phases of social life is the
present demand of the students. No longer is
Latin America to be an extension of “decadent”
Europe. Faith in the American dollar no longer
drives Latin America to associate its future with
the “American colossus.”

“The new generation,” said a manifesto at the
University of Cordoba, in Argentina, “consider
that the fresh cycle of civilization that is begin-
ning, the seat of which will be in America . . . de-
mands a total change of human values and a dif-
ferent orientation of spiritual forces, in keeping
with an ample democracy devoid of all dogmas and
prejudices.’ ’

This is part of the blind effort, to _be witnessed

in every country, to seek economic justice for man-_

kind.

' Europe is shared only by dissatisﬁed social mi-
norities . . . that the thought of peace, there as
here, is a considered probability; that the “class
struggle” is a wishful phantom of revolutionaries
. . . receives no encouragement from European
magazines of opinion.

The readers of such a journal as the “Nineteenth
Century and After,” for example, ﬁnd the three
leading articles of the current issue concerned with
military and strategic discussion. Conﬁdence that
war is shortly inevitable and that the fatherland
(Great Britain inthis case) must arrive at the sec-
ond Arma'geddon'be'tter prepared than ‘last time is

leading articles:.“Armies of the Air,” “Sea Power
and the Mediterranean,” and “Russo-Japaiiese
Friction.”

The current doctrine of war, says Lieutenant-
Colonel De\Vatteville, has to be recast. “The ﬁrst
step must be to acquire that condition of air supe-
riority which will place an opposing belligerent in
a corresponding plight of inferiority in the air over
both land and sea.” Then an integrated command
must be assured, and that immediately, to prevent
fatal (that is, in a national sense) jealousy or
slackness among separate divisions of the national
“defense. ’ ’

A consideration of the military plans of other
European nations convinces DeVVatteville that
France, Russia and Italy have recast their forces
toward this “integral war.” “In the United
States,” he says, however, “the new theory of war
has made no progress.”

So it is with the other writers for the “Nine-
teenth Century.” Through their talk of "Mediter-
ranean harbors and fortresses (“The Malta garri-
son would hold the fortress long enough”) one
can hear the rattle of their nervous teeth. “To
feel really comfortable,” they require at least 8,-
000,000 tons of fuel oil to be stored in England.
And so on.

The “Saturday Review,’ with a somewhat less
cerebral patronage, smashes out in the October 13
issue with a front page challenge in red ink:
“Under Which Flag? The Honored Flag of our
Forefathers—when Britannia Ruled the Wa.ves——
and kept the Peace of the \Vorld because Her Navy
was Supreme . . . Or . . . The Red Flag of Socialists,
Communists, and Bolshevists———three Names with
but One Meaning—Disintegration and Slavery for
all Britons?”

7

Then the articles trail off: “Socialists Squashed'

in Spain,” “Pa.ciﬁsts Rule Our Army,” and “The
Man with a Purpose, Cecil Rhodes, the Empire-
Builder, Who Believed in His Country.”

It looks like a good year for the journals, but a
bad winter for English peace‘ of mind.

Exchange Opinion

Population Uncared for While American Medicine
Maintains Its Integrity. ,
AMERICA found Chief Sitting Bull wrapped in
a quilt and ever since our fathers’ native land

has swaddled its theories in blanket clauses.

Merely exhale the word socialism and it would,
have been wiser if you had swallowed your breath.%

And yet because America has branded this word,
countless numbers of its citizens are without ined-
ical care today while doctors and nurses are un-
eai-thing ditches in city streets or pounding type-
writers in brokerage offices.

It is evident that adjustinent lies in social iii-
suraiice. Still, when on the eve of the opening
session of the annual convention of the American
Medical Association. in Cleveland this year the
American College of Surgeons advocated health in-
surance, paternal members of the organization
arose in all their wrath and glory denouncing the
teinerity of such a suggestion.

Daring though it may be, the pla.n works. Since
1929 Dr. Clifford Loos and Dr. Donald E. Ross
have operated a clinic in Los Angeles that is treat-
ing 15,000 patients at a cost of two dollars a month.
Of course these two physicians were dismissed from
the County Medical Association, but they have con-
tinued administering to the needs of the sick in
their ﬁve story building‘ equipped for clinical pur-
poses, where they are assisted by a staff of ﬁfty-
ﬁve physicians and 110 other attaches.

Kyle Crichton advances an interesting note in
the current Collier ’s concerning health insurance.
l\.'l.r. Cricliton says that the American Medical Asso-
ciation looks on health insurance as an entering
wedge for state medicine; the British Medical So-
ciety regards it as a most eﬁective weapon against
socialism and infers that Americans are confusing
sociology with socialism.

It is time for the American Medical Association
to be a little more discriininating in the use of its
terms. It would be well to pull down the covers
a little on this blanket term, socialism. An easy
guess would place this charge in the hands of the
younger doctor of the day. Anierican schools of
medicine could serve no worthicr cause.——Tlie Flor-

Calls Bard Only
Poet By Chance

By Ruth Horowitz.

“College students do not get much
by merely reading Shakespeare in the
classroom,” declared Fritz Leiber after
his performance as King Lear Thurs-
day night. “Of course one does gain
something by reading Sliakespeare,"
said Mr. Leiber, “but one must re-
member that Shakespeare was pri-
marily adramatist. It was a pure ac-
cident that he was also a great poet
and a great master of English. He did
not write his plays to confound pos-

terity 300 years later; he wrote them
to be acted.

“There are scenes ln_-Shakesp_eare’s
plays,” Mr. Leiber continued, “which
have practically no effect when they
are read, yet are powerful on the
stage. Then there is much stage bus-
iness not written down in the books
at all. This every Shakespearean
actor has evolved for himself and
adds about 100 per cent to the vivid-
ness of the p-lay.”

Other members of the cast were
more concerned with how the play
had gone over than with the effect
of Shakespeare in general, "Gosh,"
said Edgar, (who in real life is Fritz
Leiber, Jr.) “was I nervous in that
scene where I was supposed to kill
Edmund. You see he pushed his
sword up a funny kind of way, so
that I really had to nick his neck a
little and when he gave that choking
sort of gurgle I thought. for sure I'd
punctured his jugular vein. I think
the rest of the company were a little
afraid he was really dying, too.”

At this point Edgar was interrupted
by an irate Earl of Gloucester. “Let
me at him,” shouted Gloucester. “Of
all the people in the- company, it had
to be my foot he stepped on. I don't
see why .” King Lear himself had
to intervene and preserve the peace.

Offstage King Lear, also known as
Hamlet, Shylock and Macbeth, Fritz
Leiber, is a white haired, leathery
faced man who smokes a pipe.

Vivid Digressors

 

 

To Communicate Experiences,

College Professor’s Duty

By Edwin Banks

College professors have been crit-
icized for not sticking to the subject
in conducting their classes. It has
been objected that they will wander
off into ﬁelds wholly unrelated to the
topic or even the course which their’
students are supposed to be studying
Provided the teacher is not hopeless
ly dull, I think that most students are;
agreed that these digressions are not‘
weaknesses but rather the most val-
uable material that he can impart.
’ The student with a modicum of in-
telligence, after all, can get the basic,
information about a course from the
textbooks. Here is the store of knowl-
edge from which he can draw all he
needs. What he is interested in ab
sorbiiig from the professor is the lat-

ter’s ideas; that is, those concepts he
has built up out of consideration ofi
the facts. And although a groundwork!
of dates, names, movements, and;
mechanics is absolutely essential to
any man’s education, his real matur-
ity arrives when he has learned how
to assemble the data, classify it, and
make use of it.

The chief function of the college
professor should be, it seems to me,
to communicate his own experiences
in attaining and expending his matur-
ity. As far as I am concerned person-
ally. I care little whether my instruc-
tor in the history of Siam spends
three-quarters of every class period
discussing Nazism or the Carnegie In-
ternational. I can get all I want to‘
know about sacred elephants and‘,
twins in my textbook, I hope, but 1:
only hear Dr. Blank"s political and
estlietic ideas in his class. .

It should be understood that I am
not advocating a complete dissociationl
between the professor’s lectures and,
the nature of his course. So extreme‘,
a position would obviously be al)surd.i
But I urge every teacher who has
hitherto kept his nose to the grind-
stone of his subject to throw off all-
restraint, if his mind occasionally,
seeths with a bright idea, no matter!
how irrelevant it may be, and to un-l
burden it on his pupils. They won'ti
object. i

Ask any undergraduate on the cam-g
pus, above the intellectual level of a;
moron. who are his most interesting;
stimulating professors. I wager that‘
his answer will name the most bril-
liant digressors. May we have more
of them.

Wonder how many people actually
thrill to the sight of a picture of a
deceased halibut or a crude vase of
wilted pansies. Such a delight as
the layman possibly may get must be
intangible indeed. The artist seldom
approaches an actuality, and as for
the “idea” of the ﬁsh or ﬂowers, it
would be less vaguely expressed in
words.

Pearlman Oﬁers
Theories On Art

Columnist Declares Best Critic Of
Picture To Be Artist

By Raymond Pearlman.

Negative , criticisms toward my
columns are just heart-rendering. The
only consolation Ilhave for such ob-
jurgations is that every embryonic
writer must withstand the inevitable
and ﬁery remarks of his critics.
“Sloppy sentiment," “crack brained,”
“intellectual snob,” “high-brow writ-
ing,” “superﬁcial Pearlinania,” and a
hundred other worse ones, yes, these
remarks are the rewards of my opera.
Ali! ‘What we genii must suffer. What
soiiorous phrases will be hurled at
me after this column, I sliculd rather
not hear! *

Yet perhaps my critics are right, in
saying that most of my stuff is the
product of a cracked brain. The fol-
lowing theory on art probably proves
their point. But in this case I am
somewhat convinced that they are on
the wrong side of the feiice. I-Iere it
is, anyway.

An original piece of art, it seems
to me, is a purely subjective matter.
An artist in creating an original piece
of art, is revealiiig to himself sonic-
thing from his own realm of experi-
ence. He is secretly coininuiiicating
to himself, and all other persons are
without meaning to him. Hence, there
is but one man fit to judge his work;
and that person is the artist himself.
The only and the most perfect critic
of Antonia Allegri’s work is Allegri
himself. The best critic of Da Vinci
is dead‘, It is needless to add that
Bluine is the best critic of “South of
Scranton." Only the artist himself
knows whether the fulﬁllment of his
experience. has been realized. And fur-
tlierniore, it follows that the spec-
tator is not a criterion by which the
worth of an original work of art’
should be judged. In this particular
case, the spectator cannot be a critic,
for he judges the pictures through the
medium of his own-experience, which
is nearly always different, I might
even say antithetical, to the experi-
ence of the artist. This last point re-
calls another of my crack-braiiied
ideas.

It has to deal with perception in
works of art. Perception, as you all
know, is entirely an individual mat-
ter. You may be looking at a line
and thinking it crooked, and to me
-it may appear straight. To revert to
painting—what you, percliance, see in
a picture may-be altogether different
from what I am looking at. Or, in
other words, how can we tell what
another sees and whether we are both
seeing the same things? This theory

is good for ratioiializing_ If some one.

regard to the International l$‘_,_.-_.,__,,'Sll.f-
ﬁcient evidence to illumine the point.
The situation must have been sonic-
what humorous. Where one judge
saw a curved line, perchance, another
saw a crooked; where one saw yellow,
perhaps, the other judge orange. Hence
you see it is practically impossible
to get three judges to see the same
picture in the same way. . . .

Game Titan Team
Allows Pitt Only
Five Touchdowns

 

Weinstock, Randour Score Twice
In Mud Battle While Fans
Risk Pneumonia Gases

Reserves Get Workout

By Charles A. Ruch
“The day was cold and dark and
dreary '
It rained and the wind was never
weary.”

That is the story of the Pitt-West-
minster game in simple language.
Five times the Pitt backs managed to
shake off the rain and mud to score
touchdowns. Those were the only
thrills ‘which came to the customers
along with plenty of chills.

Before the spectators had adjusted
their rain-resisting equipment and be-
fore the foreign sports writer had
talked the gate-keeper into submission
Pitt had its ﬁrst score. Weinstock
took it over on a 65-yard run and all
that happened thereafter was extra.

Westminster made its biggest ﬂurry
just after the opening kickoff when a
pass play gained 15 yards. After that
the Titans didn’t become very unruly.

The Panthers then put in a little
more time adding a rich chocolate
sauce to their white jerseys and then
Weinstock managed to batter his way
through the line on a short buck for
touchdown number two. Izzy missed
the extra point again, kicking a ball
that would have passed for a mis-
shapen medicine ball.

Rain, and great portions of it, be-
gan to fall at this point. The Pitt at-
tack bogged down in what cannot be
more vividly described than just plain
mud. Hub Randour ﬁnally broke
loose to count another score for the
Panthers Rector missed the try for
point as a matter of procedure and a
few minutes later the half ended.

Immediately everyone dashed for
cover and left the stadium as deserted
as a chaperon at a house party. When
the game was resumed, a capacity
crowd of 60 jammed every nook and
cranny of the ﬁrst two rows in sec-
tion 3.

Randour again became the life of
the party with a run of some 30 yards
for Pitt’s fourth score. This time
Rector ran the ball for the point when
the pass from center was bad. It was
all in vain, however, for the rule
which makes the ball dead when the
knee of the fellow handling it touches
the ground applied to the back hold-
ing the ball for Rector’s placement.

A huzzah which could be heard for
almost 50 feet went up from the
rather scrawny gathering as Suther-
land sent in the ﬁrst-stringers. In due
course of time Mike Nicksick was
away for the fifth and ﬁnal touchdown
of the day. To make it unanimous,
the kick for the point went wild.

The Titans did well, especially the
right end Edwin Austen and right
halfback Jack Laraway. Laraway was
injured late in the game and had to
be assisted from the ﬁeld.

Winners Surprise Frosh With
Early Touchdown Parades

 

Showing a complete reversal of
form, the Kiski Prep eleven took over
Pitt’s freshman outﬁt at Saltsburg
Saturday. The score was 13-0. It
was the ﬁrst game Kiski won this
year and also marked the ﬁrst time
they have scored.

Campbell, Kiski fullback, plunged
over for the ﬁrst touchdown after a
sustained Kiski drive down the ﬁeld
in the early minutes of the game. A
blocked punt in the second quarter
gave the winners the ball on the Pitt
20 and Patrick took it over a few
plays later.

The Pitt attack got under way in
the fourth quarter to bring the ball
inside the Kiski 10-yard line twice.
An intercepted pass halted the ﬁrst
advance and the ﬁnal whistle cur-
tailed the other, -

Pitt Gridders S p o r t
Q n i t e Expensive
Wardrobes

 

What the average coed wears to a
football game hardly compares in cost
with the outﬁt one of the football play-
ers wears on the ﬁeld.

Although her shoes may be I.
Miller's best, it is highly improbable
that they set her back to the extent
of $14.00, the cost of a gridders’ foot
covering. At any rate, she won’t
need a set of cleats at 98 cents a set.
Nor will a pair of shoulder pads re-
tailing at $10.75 be listed among her
accessories. Even if she is wearing
her favorite ostrich feather hat the
cost of her headgear is not likely to
equal the $8.50 spent for the football
player's helmet.

A check—up with Percy S. Browne,
Pitt equipment custodian, reveals that
each Panther gridder trots onto the
ﬁeld sporting an outﬁt costing not
less than $60.65. Added to this must
be the necessary practice equipment
and uniform changes which put the
price of the player's wardrobe up to
$100.40.

Even if the comparison of costs is a

bit off-, it is a sure bet that the grid-
der’s clothes weigh considerably more
than those of the average coed. Al-
though she may be wearing a fur coat

Program Planned

 

Physical Education ‘Department
To Sponsor Novice Games

The physical education department
is planning an Intramural sports pro-
gram which will extend throughout
the ﬁrst semester. It is planned to
organize leagues in touch-football,
basketball, volleyball and mushball;
and meets will be conducted for indi-
vidual participants in handball, swim-
ming, boxing, wrestling, and track.

The department is interested in or-
ganizdng at present a touch-football

league, which will be composed of
nine-man teams. It is hoped that the
YMCA, engineering students, medical
students, dental students and other
groups will organize teams.
If there are enough entries, a separate
league will be formed for each divi-
sion, otherwise one league will be
formed, The games will be played aft-
er school, during the activities period,
and on Saturdays.

After Thanksgiving a basketball
league will be started and any stu-
dent group may enter teams. The;
games will be played on week nights}
during the activities period, and on
Saturdays.

A swimming meet will be held in
February for which all men who are
not varsity letter-winners are eligible
to compete. All students who are in-
terested in competing in any of these
activities are asked to sign the ac-
companying blank and turn it in to
the sports editor at the Pitt News
office. ‘

1 Two Shades Of Green

On Saturday the Irish will be with
‘Iisi again, There are few,’ if any, peo-
ple who sat or stood in the stadium
stands on October 29, 1932, the occa-
sion of the last Irish visit to Pitts-
burgh to play Pitt, who do not remem-
ber that famous day and year.

That was the day when the sons of
Erin went braugh. The literal mean-
ing of that sentence isn’t quite clear
to some of the Irishmen in our midst

who claim the phrase is misused, At]

the present time there are four Eng-

lishmen in the office and two Irish-l

men. The sentence stands_

Notre Dame was then a power which
swept everything before it. Coach
Hunk Anderson had begun where
Rockne left off and the Irish came to
Pittsburgh with‘ a team that had av-
eraged almost a point,-a-minui:e‘in pre-
vious games that season. “Class” was
their middle name, “victory" was their
watchword.

When the long string of green-
jerseyed men trotted onto the ﬁeld
and went through their warm-up ex-
ercises with an ease and grace and a
sure-ﬁre attitude, there were many
folks in the stands who mentally pat-
ted themselves on the back because
they hadn’t placed those attractive

ibets against the Irish.

But before the ﬁrst half was over,
everyone could tell that something a
little strange was happening, Every-
thing the Irish had to oﬁer was being
taken by the Panthers in a very mat-
ter-of-fact fashion_ True. Pitt wasn’t
getting anywhere; but neither were
the Irish.

Then came the ﬁnal quarter, bring-

'ing with it ﬁreworks enough to throw

the crowd into the wildest uproar the
stadium has ever seen. Bobby Hogan
started it all with a mighty 80-yard
punt from behind his own goal line,
the play which took the sparkle from
the Irish emeralds,

Hogan followed his splendid boot by

nabbing at Notre Dame pass. Several.
plays later," Mike Sebastian was seen
starting out around left end, Notre
Dame tacklers appeared to be every-
where in his path but none could drop
the boy whom writers began to call
“the Rambling Rose of -Sharon.” Mike
traveled 46 yards for that score while
Irish hearts became unhappy at every
stride he took.

Minutes later came the anti-climax
when Ted Daily, Pitt end. pulled down
a frantic Notre Dame pass and quickly
stepped through a few clawing Irish
men for the second touchdown. After
that there wasn’t a thing else neces-
sary.

It will be a different Notre Dame
team that comes here Saturday_ The
Irish will be in a different position.
Instead of ruling the roost, so to‘
speak. the Notre Dame boys are in‘

top,
stride, the South Benders have been
working up to a peak of form and are
very likely to hit it on Saturday.

A new coach will be doing the di-
recting, a new set of stars will be do-
ing the shining, and a new era of
Notre Dame football will be rising as.
the Irish clash with Pitt. Elmer Lay-
den has built up after a pretty miser-
able season last year. and, although
the Irish lost a tough 7-6 opening bat-
tle with ‘Texas, the current season has
been quite satisfactory for the natives
of South Bend.

Pitt will not be in quite so favorable
a spot this time, for overconﬁdencc
won’t be doing the Notre Dames any
harm. The set-up will be a little dif
ferent; the Irish will sport a different
shade of green.

After two banner ball games such
as the Pitt-Southern Cal and the Pitt-
Minnesota affairs, it's highly likely
that Saturday’s game will be the
charm of them all.

On with the dance andno shilalahs,
please,

Three Activities  
To Widen Scope
Of WAA Plans

President Announces Addition
Of Handball, Riﬂe Practice,
Handcraft To Program

 

 

“Activities offered to members of
WAA will be increased in scope,"
says Francis Dent, Ed35, president of
the organization. Handball, rifie prac-
tice and handcraft are to be added to
the schedule and WAA will co-operate
with the VVomen’s Student Health
ofﬁce in presenting Student Health
weeks.

It is the aim of WAA members this
year to begin a collection of songs
on some phase of the organization’s
activities. Ruth Belle Strothers, C37,
has been named chairman of a com-
mittee which will plan for a song
contest soon to be submitted to the
campus.

A new health topic will be pre-
sented to the campus each month as
a part of Student Health weeks. In-
formation will be presented through
WAA and Student Health announce-
ment boards, the Pitt News and
Sports Sidelights, the ofﬁcial publica-
tion. of WAA. Jane Booth, Marie
Bryan and Louise Jackson will be
in charge of the November health
weeks.

Leather work, bead work and knit-
ting will be included in the handcraft
class. Student managers have begun
to take roll of activities hours which
count towards the VVAA keystone
awards. Physical education majors
need three hours a week towards an
award and other student members
need two hours a week participation.

It is still possible to join VVAA.
Salesmen at the WAA candy stands
will receive subscriptions.

The next association meeting will
be on November 21 at Heinz House.
Elsie Simmons, Ed35, Martha Mc-

Modern Fashions
Determined By
Personality

 

‘Students of the Research Bureau for
Retail ‘Training illustrated last
Thursday afternoon what the well-
dressed woman wears to bring out her
personality. 2 ‘

Mrs, Grace Ely Studybaker, stylist
for the Bureau, divided women’s types
into three general classes: dramatic,
feminine, and tailored. According to
Mrs. Studybaker, “The clothes of the
dramatic woman are most often ex-
pressive for unusual chic and" indi-
vidual. It is the dramatic woman
who first sponsors the new and novel;
anything" involved, intricate, or glit-
tering intrigues her.” Demonstrating
the dramatic type, _-Dorothy Kaufman
modeled ﬁrst a blue-grey ﬂannel, set
oﬁ by silver buttons and white, pique
trimming. Next she wore an evening
dress which she had remodeled her-
se1f—a striking black gown with
sleeves and neck in contrasting silver
cloth. For her afternoon dress, Miss
Kaufman wore a brown-ribbed satin
with glittering buckles and white
satin collar and cuffs. Barging into
the ﬁeld of aviation, Miss Kaufman
also modeled what Mrs. Studybaker
termed a “stratosphere blue” evening
gown, and were with it a black velvet
and ermine wrap, Should a co-ed
fancy herself the dramatic type, she
might well lend an eye to Miss Kauf-
man’s ﬂare for dramatic touches.

Typing the girl who wears “curved
lines, dainty details, soft fabrics, and
soft colors” as feminine, Mrs. Study-
baker demonstrated how Miss II-lulda
Brierly were her clothes to her best
advantage. Miss Brierly’s afternoon
dress was black, with soft and ﬂatter-
ing touches of old rose. An interest-
ing ‘feature of this dress was the slit.
in the back of the skirt,

Miss Nina C. Lambert wore ﬁrst one
of the new “ostrich” wools in blue
with navy blue accessories that was
well suited to her type of the semi-
tailored, semi-feminine. woman. As
her afternoon dress, Miss Lambert
wore a black tunic frock with the new
“ecclesiastic” collar,

Of the current evening styles, Mrs.
Studybaker said, “Evening dresses
are getting away from the night gown
simplicity entirely, and are becoming
more buffon a.nd “robe de style.” Hel-
en Baerman were one of the new
gowns in “electric” blue, with the
Cleopatra inﬂuence in gold sandals
and accessories, while Mrs. B. Kirk
-Payne modeled one of the very latest
dresses in metallic green fabric dem-
onstrating the tunic and high neck
style.

“Above all,” concluded Mrs. Study-
