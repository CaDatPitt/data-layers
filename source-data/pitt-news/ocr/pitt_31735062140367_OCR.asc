lowa Defense Stamp  

Dr. Reuben ,S.lSlesinger, instruct-
or in economics, initiated faculty
participation in the defense stamp
drive with the purchase of a $100
defense bond yesterday.

Jack Brady,’ C42, publicity di-if

rector, hopes that Dr. Slesinger's
participation in the drive may
serve as an incentive to the rest
of the faculty in the matter of buy-
ing stamps and bonds.

“Not all faculty members» are
expected to buy bonds, but
they all should assume the respon-
sibility of buying the 25-cent
stamps on sale every Wednesday,”
said Brady.

Faculty members who are now
buying bonds at banks and post-
olﬁces have been asked to buy di-
rectly from the local committee on
campus.

Committee members anticipate
that sales today will double last
week’s eiforts, provided that the
original 333 purchasers repeat their
buying activities, and that the in-
tervening publicity has inﬂuenced
at least as many more students to
buyvistamps.

United States Not Lacking
ln Supply of Vital Metals

Ir ALLEN ABRAMSON _
During the war the United States

is not in danger of a" lack of vital

‘metals, in the opinion of Henry

IV

‘=._, Leighton, professor and head of the
department, of geology.

1? He maintains that the nation
Eneed not fear a shortage of the

(‘two metals most important in war

production, manganese and tin.

During the first World war, the
United States, although not com-
pletely cut off from ore shipments,

“began mining low grade manga-

pnese deposits in the Rocky Moun-

9...,

tain states. Production was aban-

doned after the war because of the .

excessive cost.

   
 
 

 
   
 
 
  
  
   

e The mines are now reopened,
and in two places production will‘
be sufficient to care for all our
needs./Meanwhile, imports from the
small Brazilian deposits should
keep us supplied, Mr. Leighton be-
lieves.

Dr. Leighton expects that after

the war we will again abandon our

production because of the high
cost, and return to our former
sources. '

Petitions for chairmanship of
Spring Festival events should be
ﬁled in the dean of men's ollice

. by 5 o'clock this afternoon. Spe-
ciﬁc events are: Inter-fraternity

 track meet, Carnival night, Tap -

day, Inter-fraternity sweepstakes,
and Festival dance. .

Coed chairman of the whole
festival also should turn in her
petition to the dean of men’: of-
ﬁce. All interviews will be con-
 by executive committee

Bolivia will be able to supply tin,
Mr. Leighton points out, since that
country is rapidly expanding ‘its
production. In a short time, Bo-
livia's production will have reached
a point -where fears of a tin short-
age can be permanently abandoned.

Student Conclave Slzows
Pitt Alweacl in Dclcns

By LOIS ROWBOTTOM
“A heck of a big problem” is
how Edward Tait, BA42, described
morale when he returned Monday
‘ from the Pennsylvania Intercollegi-
ate Student Government associa-
tion convention.

The purpose of the conclave at
Bucknell university this past week-
end was to discuss student morale
and defense movements for college
‘students.

Pitt delegates learned that the
University was far ahead of other
colleges in its defense program.
Representatives from these other
schools were particularly interest-
,’/ed in the University’s plans for
ﬁrst aid stations and the proposed
ambulance corps.

Dr. H. Marts, president of /the
Pennsylvania Civilian Defense
council, addressing the convention,

declared, “The United States is
living on borrowed time.” Marts
believes our allies are holding the
armed forces at the various war
fronts, thus giving the United
States a breathing spell during
which we can better equip ourselves
for the future.

George Munger, coach at the
University of Pennsylvania, spoke
to the group concerning the im-
portance of physical fitness at this
time. He deﬁned morale as “edu-
cation plus activity," and said that
students must have confidence in
their. school defense programs be-
fore they will cooperate with them.

Tait will make a report on the
convention to University \of’ﬁcials

tion from the University included

BA44.

nounced that $75, total proceeds of
the affair, have been turnedyyover to

Latin -American
Decorations

Pan-American decorations will
color the Interfraternity ball at
the William Penn hotel Friday.

Flags of the various South and
Central American countries will

be worn, and that if worn they will
be removed ‘at the door. The dance
committee has suggested that
money saved by not buying cor-
sages be spent for defense st-amps.‘

Tire Shortage
Hits Pitt Corps

The tire shortage has affected
the University Ambulance corps,
causing it to remain temporarih»
dormant. 3‘

Letters have been sent to all
students who volunteered the ser-
vice of their cars for the corps
because deﬁnite plans cannot be
made until organizers lmow exact-
ly how manyicars to depend upon.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of pi

men's Student Health service, who
organized the ambulance corps said
that original plans will have to be
changed. The corps will operate as
a shuttle, and will carry patients
from the University to hospitals.

p Announcements of this propos-
ed corps were made in the Pitt
News shortly after December 7.
Forms which appeared in the De-
cember l5 issue were filled out by
students who offered to become
members of the corps. lt is from
this list of volunteers that Dr}
Carlson hopes to get the 60 cars
he needs.

 

Because of US Entrance lnto’ War

BY STUDENT
OF AMERICA

AUSTIN, Texas.—-College men
and women’s hopes for marriage
have taken a decided drop since the
United States entered the war.

This and the fact that the no-
tion that the draft created a rush
to the altar is a myth—at least
among collegians-—were indicated
in a survey conducted last week
by Student Opinion Surveys of
America.

of them have that same hope.

The attitude of the students ii
regard to the immediate future is
shown in the poll by the fact that
only 15 per cent of both sexes
have any hope today of marrying»
within a year of graduation.

Contrasting with thisis the num-
ber of engagements, which appear
to be comparatively high.

That’s why Republican Spain
held out so long. The people who

For India is coming into the war,
sooner than expected. The Jap-
anese are headed. into‘Burma. And
they’re going to get in there.,Af—
ter that they’ll try to push through
India. I

But if the Indian people don't
want the Japanese in their coun-
try, there are enough of them old
enough and big enough and strong
enough to keep the Japanese sol-
diers out. And there are enough
Indian and Chinese people to push

Change I
Some people will say that they
are better off that way, happier.
But unfortunately, no people can
remain static, no matter how happy
they are. And the present white-

‘man-rule is .enforcing a static con-

dition on the people, which even
the people now desire to shake»of‘f.

There are , intel.ligen‘t, learned,

~..a.nd wise Indians prepared to lead

the Indian people in war and in
peace. They have grown out of the
people, just as anywhere else, and
they can rally the people to the de-
tense of India, as no white—helmet—
ed Sahib can. . « .

What does this mean? It means
‘simply that India must’ be freed, a
demand that liberals‘and radicals
have made for ‘years on the basis
that imperialism was degrading
and destructive, and which is made
nowon a world wide military basis.

Freedom ,

With a free India and a ﬁghting
China on our side, with the count-
less millions or men, women, and

might, We can win. this war in

over Westminster’s terriﬁc‘

In facing Grover Washabaugh's

Jimmy Egan. While the current
campaign has been :i'ar from a hap-

merely playing out the schedule
tonight and next Saturday against‘
Army, these three seniors will go
all out to make their final appear-
ance in a Pitt uniform result in a
win.
However, they have a tough job
'ahead of them because of a few
players named Dunmire, Fox, Ridl,

member of the invading forces,
Charlie Goldblum, will have a lot
to do with the ﬁnal outcome oi.’ the

These six men ‘have been {he

When the Jungle Cat’s’ indoor

cording to reports from the Pan-

year's South High team, is the num-
ber one replacement on this cham-
pionship outﬁt. He is only a fresh-
man, but has already shown that
he is one of the best prospects for
future stardom on the ‘Westmins-
ter squad. ‘

As far as Pitt is concerned to-

A win for the Panther swimming
team today will mean more than
an ordinary victory for the home
i'orces over those of Kenyon Col-
lege.

It will guarantee a mark of four
wins out of five meets, it will break
a mark of 17 straight triumphs
which has been set by the Ohio
mermen over a period of twolyears,
and it will mean avenging last
year's 51-24 defeat which was
handed to, the Pitt lads by the
Kenyon team. ‘

Star diver Dick Amcs and breast-
stroke man Herb Cosgrove were
the only Gold and Blue color bear-
ers able to win first places in last
season’s defeat. At that time, Ken-
yon coach Charles lmel was able to
exhaust whatever strength the
Pitt squad had by throwing reserve
after reserve into the ‘fray.

Coach Ben Grady promises that
this time it will be a different story.
He said, “Kenyon has lost quite :1
few good men from last season’s
team and this factor will tend to
make it a Very close race this time.
As was the case in our last meet, if
the boys can hold their own until
the relay team goes into action
then we may have a chance.”

So far, the relay team of Cap-
tain lilerb Cosgrove, Al Samson,
Gus Wilde, and Joe Orloff has been
coming through in great shape.
Last week against Franklin and
-‘Marshall, they negotiated the dis-
tance in a winning time of 4:0l.2
and clinched the meet. 4
The Kenyon, squad that has al-
ready ‘tacked up wins at the "ex-
pense of Cincinnati and Woost'e‘r'i‘s
made up of such standouts as-
sprinters,'Tiller, Lewis, and Fuller;
diver, Brouse; breast-stroke, Blacka
and Hensel; and distance man
Kingen.

Of these, Black}; has been espe-

‘night’s game will bring them a
little closer to ﬁnishing a night-
marish season. What was supposed

T to be a first class campaign has
' turned out to be a disappointment

for the local hoopsters.

To their credit, however, they
have not stopped trying. Last Sat-
Penn State
played the kind of game that usu-

urday against they
ally nine times out of ten they
would have won. But the breaks
just didn’t go their way, and at

their showing against State. If
they play the same type of game’
against Westminster tonight. he

While comparison of the Panth-

~ In an effort to acquarint students
withmajor tasks that confront gov-
ernment in this emergency and the
necessary steps which must be tak-
en to successfully complete them,
a new course is being taught for
the first time this semester by Dr.
Marion McKay, professor of eco-
nomics.

The interest shown by the 62 day
and evening students who take this
new course in war economics is di-
rect proof of the timeliness of the
course.

The course begins with the study
of the economic background that

Dr. Jacobson

“Separation of church and state
in the United States was never in-
tended to deprive children of the
resources of religion,“ Dr. E. W.
Jacobson, dean of ' the School of
Education, said at the seventy-see
ond annual convention of the
American Association of School
Administrators in San’ Francisco
yesterday.

Speaking on “Religious Educa-
tion and the Public Schools,” Dr.
Jacohsen explained that there has
been a. growing conviction on the
part of public school ofﬁcials that
the weakest point in the educa-
tional program is at the point of
moral and spiritual ideals.’_’

To remedy this situation, Dr.
Jacobson suggested the released
time plan, whereby pupils by con-
sent or request of parents are re-
leased one or more periods a week
to receive religious instruction pro-
'vided by the churches and syna-

gogues. This plan, the dean‘ said,
' appears to olfer the best opportu-
nity for cooperation of church,
school, and home.
Dr. Jacobson revealed that 41
states now are trying out the re-
leased time plan. Some of the re-
quirements for the plan's success-
ful operation are: ‘

1. church» .i.;.u1a be discour-

aged from undertaking this work
until they have made adequate
preparation for it.

.2. Schools should not release
time for weekday classes unless
they are ready to cooperate in
every detail in carrying out the
program. -

3. Public schools can provide a
deﬁnite moral basis for the teach-
ing of religion by extending their
program on the side of ethical and
moral nlues.

the course covers.

In an interview concerning the
course, Dr. McKay said all the
problems will‘he discussed from a
national viewpoint rather than
from a local one as the labor and
readjustment problems might seem
to indicate.

“The modes of living of yester-
day,” Dr. McKay, stated, “are one
by one being forced to change de-

cidedly. By proﬁting from experi- -

ences learned in the World War I
I believe the government will, be
able to avoid another depression

after this war. Plans are already a

supply these and to assist in get-
ting the world back on its feet.
