The first regular meeting of the
Cercle Francais of the University of

Prof. Collette of Carnegie Tech-

One of the officers in speaking of
the work of the club said yesterday:
“An organization most vitally needed
in this school is a club which will
keepthe people in the towns and
cities from which the students come
well informed as to the work which

more attention must be paid to keep-

INFORMAL DANCE IS GIVEN

Boys Attempt to Surpass Leap Year
Dance of Girls.

On last Friday evening an informal
dance was given by about twenty—ﬁve
“social lions” of Pitt in honor of our
fair and fascinating co—eds. Not long
ago the dames gave a “leap year”
dance and invited many Pitt men to
attend, and so the latter, not wishing
to’ be outdone, got together‘ and de-
cided to give a similar affair, which
would be just a little bit better. The
committee in charge of affairs consist-
ed of Coen, Lamp and Dickey. The
room was handsomely decorated with
the Pitt colors. Each girl was honored
by having her name printed in gold
letters upon her dance program and
by being presented with a beautiful
carnation. The music was furnished
by the Stewart orchestra, consisting of
ﬁve pieces.‘ A buffet lunch was served
throughout the evening. The boys, it
is understood, have defied the girls to
surpass them.

It was de-
cided that the student participation in
the anniversary celebration should be
a torch light parade ending in a large
bon ﬁre on the campus. Cap night
will also be held at this time and the
usual, refreshments of cider and
pretzels will be served. A committee
was appointed to "arrange for the de-
tails of this celebration.

A committee was also appointed to '

discuss plans for an organization to
regulate the ﬁnances of all student or-
ganizations. Mr. Conrad was ap-
pointed to investigate and report on
the removal of the lockers from Thaw
to State Hall.

T‘he election of Senators to succeed
those whose terms expire-the ﬁrstor
February was set for Friday, Febru-
ary 2nd at 10:45 -A. M.

It was decided that the. Senate
would hold a luncheon and business
meeting and a committee was ap-
pointed to set the date and arrange
the details. _

The next meeting will be held after
the election on Friday morning.

'ARCHAEOLOG1GAL SOCIETY

Irish, Story Teller Relates Stories of
Irish Iife——Many Fables Are Told.
The students of the’Playground

in \ the University were the

guests at a feast of Irish stories
served in -the chapel room of Thaw

‘ Hall on last Saturday morning. Mr.
iMcManus, an original Irish character,
.served the delicacy in that way that

none but an Irishman can portray.
“Ireland is a land of story telling,"

“Each district has a profes-

sional story teller; and each one holds

[an almost sacred place in the minds

and hearts of the people. All -the chil-
dren for miles around gather to hear

these stories on the long winter even-
nigs.’’ \
There are also traveling «tramps,

"known as Bacahs, who go over .all the
districts at will. You may see him
on the horizon at dusk, scanning the
country about, to see the house with
the most smoke coming from it. This
is where the largest pot is boiling and
here is theplace he directs ‘his steps.

In he goes 1-ike a son or brother.

The house welcomes him as a long '

lost cousin and for the time every-
thing is Bacah. After the meal they
sit about .the ﬁre while he gives out
his romantic tales, which cause the

1 boys and girls to sit and listen with

awe.

During -the stories the students
traveled back to babyland through a
thousand countries. Though the tales
were in a different plane than the
minds of those in the back seats, order
was ‘restored by the presence of school
“ma’a.ms.” A hearty welcome w.as ex-
tended by all present to the visitors.

PROMINENT ADVERTISING
‘ EXPERT SPEAKS

 

Students in Journalism Class Hear
Lecture on “The Business of Ad-
. vertising” by W. T. Mossman.

 

Wm. T. Mossman, who has charge
of the advertising of the Jones &
Laughlin Steel Co., spoke to t'he_
Journalism Class of the Evening
School of Economics, Accounts and
Finance, Monday evening, January 29.
on “The Business of Advertising.”
"‘Advertising,” said Mr. Mossman,
“is the greatest economic force to
keep down the high cost of living by
reason of making possible wide dis-
tribution .at a uniform price.”

Mr. Mossman further stated that
advertising is not an amusement but
a business, and only that advertising
which actually sells the goods is
worthy to be called advertising. The
science of advertising is yet in its in-
fancy and what we call go-od advertis-
be considered
good by the next generation.

Mr. Mossman spoke of the close
relation between the sales force and
the advertising department and of the
great opportunities that await the
man or woman who has ideas and
can express them clearly.

On Monday evening, February 5,
Arthur G. Burgoyne, of the Chronicle
Telegraph, will speak before the
Journalism class on “Pointed Para-
graphs.” All students are invited to
attend these talks," as they are in-
tensely practical and timely.

The Engineering lecture for next
Monday will be “Glass Furnaces.” Mr.
Eldridge, a_ superintendent of the
Carnegie Steel C0,. will speak. He is
a man who has had large_ experience
along this line and will have much of

 

interest to say on the subject. All
are urged to be present.
The faculty of the Engineering

school were -the guests at a dinner by
the Engineers Society of Western
Pennsylvania. Dr. Riddle of the class
fo ’92 of Pitt was toast master. The
dniner was an enjoyable affair. G

Mr. Harris of the University was a
guest at the installation of the hon-
orary fraternity of the Electrical En-
gineering world. This fraternity, the
Eta Phi Nu, is to the engineering
world what the Phi Beta Kappa is to
the college world. '

The company of German players at
the N-ixon next week will present
“Wohlthaeter der Menschheit” on
Monday evening; “Die Fledermans”
on Tuesday evening and Wednesday
afternoon; “Maria Stuart” on Wednes-
day evening; “Im weissen Roess’l” on
Thursday evening. All students
German in the University have an ex-
cellent opportunity to see and_ hear
these German plays presented in -the
native tongue.

By seeing Prof. Berger anyone so
desiring may get; a reduction of twen-
-ty-ﬁve cents on any. seventy-ﬁve cent

ALUMNI NOTES

Alumni Banquet Is Announced.

In a very artistic notice the Alumni
Association has announced the date
of the alumni’ banque-t. The follow-
ing letter is being sent to all alumni
ofgthe University:

Fellow _ Alumnus : ,

The one hundred twenty-fifth‘anni-
versary of the granting of the Uni-
versity’s first charter will be cele-
bra-ted February 27, 28, 29, 1912, and
the exercises "of Anniversary Day,
February 28th, will conclude with the
aluumni banquet, Soldiers’ Memorial
Hall, seven o’clock.

At the banquet we expect about
three hundred guests, among them
most prominent educators of
America and Europe. The President
of the United States, the Governor of
Pennsylvania and other distinguished
men have also been invited, and many
of these will be present.

Since we are bringing -these eminent
men to Pittsburgh, it is up to us, the

THOMASBURKE
Proprietor

THE ‘NATIONAL

Alumni, to attend and give our visitors
-the correct impression of our great
University.

The Entertainment Committee.
which has been especially enlarged
for this occasion, promises to strive
to the utmost to make this positively
the best affair of its kind in the Uni-
versity’s history, and asks you to co-
operate in making ‘it a success by
ordering your tickets promptly and
urging as many members of your class
to attend as you can. _

The capacity of the hall (the
largest banquet hall in Pittsburgh)
is limited to eight hundred, so with
three ‘hundred guests and the possible
attendance of several hundred stu-
dents and faculty members, it will be
necessary to order your ticket prompt-
ly. If you desire to bring some friend
as your guest, order his ticket at the
same time.

Seats win be allotted to ticket hold-
ers in advance of the banquet, for
which reason no tickets will be sold
on the evening of the banquet.

Allegheny fraternities are consider-
ing a plan whereby no freshman shall
be asked to join a fraternity until he
has been in school at least a half year.

In order to get the freshmen of the
University of Colorado to attend class
meetings it is necessary to ﬁrstassure
them that they will not be dunned for
their class dues.

A. church census was made. of the

students of the University of Missis-

Christian, 7; Catholic, 5; Christian Sci-

The Michigan Athletic Association
has a membership of 13,000 men.

A “cost of living” canvass recently
conducted at Ohio State shows that
it costs the average student there $§75
per year. It also shows that it costs
a senior more than a freshman, and
that a fraternity man’s expenses are
about $75 more per year than the av-
erage student.

During the past year Penn ‘had :1
total enrollment of 5,366. '

There are'46l student publications

Editor of Pitt Weekly:

Sir:—After a" long period of being
without any chapel speakers at the
weekly convocations, there came one
last week in the person of Judge Lind-
sey. .It is certain, if the expressions
of the students that have spoken to
me since the meeting are to be taken
as representative, that the return to
a chapel speaker was most heartily
enjoyed.

Er speech by some good speaker
every week is a great beneﬁt, accord-
ing to my way of thinking, and I
know that this is‘the opinion of many
other students. Such a speech as
Judge Lindsey gave last week gives a
man some thing to think about for
many a day.

May we not have some more chapel
speakers soon?

HELP THE ‘SENATE.

Many severe criticisms of the Stu-
dent Senate have been made during
the present year. But the persons
dissatisﬁed with the work of this
body are not taking the best means
to enable the students to secure bet-
ter results. To condemn without pro-
posing some means by which to rein-
edy conditions is a most foolish prac-
tice. No good can be done thereby
and much harm is probably done.
When the senators feel that they are
not supported by the students who
elected them, it is hopeless to expect
theifi to do satisfactory work. With-‘
out loyaland enthusiastic backing, no
body can do its best. Perpetual knock-
ing -is disheartening to the most en-
thusiastic person.' The time has come
in . this University when these
“knockers” niust cease their fault find-
ing and devote their energies to aid-
ing the Senate to fulﬁll its functions
inxthe most capable manner.

. To make the Senate as efficient as it
should be} two thvingsare necessary.
In the ﬁrst place every student should
see that his immediate representative
attends each meeting. If the absentee
senator knows that he is being watched
by the men who elected him, if he

» feels that he will not be re—electedi if

he does not attend to his duties prop-
erly, he will speedily realize that he
has a most important duty to perform
and will act accordingly. If student
opinion demands his atte_ndance and
active participation in every.meeting

of the senate, he will try to satisfy

this demand. The Senate is and can
be no worse thanthe students it rep-
resents. At the coming election every
care ‘should be taken that only men

who can be «trusted to perform their .
duties ‘shall be chosen.

Then watch
them and help them after election.
But aside from the actions of the
senate, many students propose plans
to fellow students———not to the Senate
—-and then growl because the Senate
does not adopt their proposals. Every
student believing that he can suggest
anything which will help the Senate’
should call the attention _of his repre-
sentative to his idea and help him
prepare it for presentation to our gov-
erning body. What the Senate needs
is not knocking, but co—operatio_n. '

EMPLOYMENT BLANKS.

Information has been received from
the Employment Bureau that the
blanks for students desiring employ-
ment during spare hours and vacation
are not being ﬁlled out. The request
has been made that all students in-
terested send in their cards as soon
as possible, since those ﬁrst applying
will be given ﬁrst choice by the Em-
ployment Bureau. From the slowness
wit'h which the cards are being re-
turnediit would seem that the great
majority of the undergraduates are not
in need of positions. If this is not the
case those expecting help from the
Employment Bureau will ﬁnd it to be
to their own advantage to return their
cards as soon as is possible.

With the blanks distributed by the
Employment Bureau were also ath-
letic information cards‘ sent out by the
athletic authorities. It isextremely.

important that answers be received
from these questions within the near
future. An effort is being made at the
present time to strengthen the ath-
letic activities of the University and it
is necessary -that each student help in
this work to the best_ of _his ability
even though his part be no greater
than that of ﬁlling out an information
blank.
VOTES ‘FOR CO-EDS.

Some one must have taken the new
Pitt Weekly box for a ballot box—at
least when the Editor opened the box
on Monday morning he found about
three hundred little slips, each having
on it “Votes ‘for Co-eds.” As the
number ofslips far exceeded the num-
ber of girls in! the University, the
young ladies must have been running
a little campaign among their ad-
mirers, or they stuffed the box—
which, of course, would not be con-
sistent with thehigh standard of po-
litical integrity whic'h the girls wish
to establish, even though -it would
show a fair knowledge of present day
political methods.

Also, in the box was found a penny
which may have been placed there as
a bribe to induce the Editor to takeia
stand for the girls in the weekly ‘pub-
lication of the University. However
the Weekly is not in the habitof ac-
cepting bribes, and surely could not
be bought for a penny, at least.

If the girls wish to vote—well and
good. Let them get this privilegeby
-the consent of those in authority to
grant such power to them; but remem-
ber the Pitt Weekly box is not yet
the ofﬁcial polling place for the young
ladies of the University.

‘Pitt ‘Patts

By Prowler.

You will recall my promise to pub-
lish an interview concerning the co-
eds. Well, I gave up the idea -after
pursuing one fair dame (name will be
given -upon receipt of a stamped and
addressed envelope) as far as the
“Idle Hour”- in Thaw Hall, where a
door was banged in my face with the

saucy retort, “I have nothing to say.

sir!” ,

And, do you know, there «is a lot of
wholesome truth in that statement.
“Nothing to say”——_how sad! Truly, a
lamentable condition when a woman
is unable to express a single word.

Most assuredly, there is something
radically wrong with our girls when
they remain silent.

But let us be fair. B The co-eds——;

oh! yes they give Leap Year dances
and occupy the front seats in the
class rooms. A quiet, sedate exist-
ence, to say the least, with ‘possibly
the occasional frivolity of .a.ttending,a
faculty tea or a Y. W. C. A. meeting.
The speed of modern life is, without
a doubt, tremendous!

Please curb that outburst of indig-
nation just a few seconds more, an.d
you will notice the purpose of these
sentences. , ‘ ' .

Girls (and I do not write this to
gain your favor, for I am strictly as-
bestos when Dan Cupid hovers into

view), there is a wonderful opportuni-
ty for you in the University. ‘The
men areiwoefully lacking in initiative;
they are like so many bleanting lambs
thatﬂpatter here and scamper there.

The women of the University have
a potent power, if they but weld their
forces into one organization. Forget
(and you can, if the attempt is made)
that Miss Persnickety belongs to the
“O. B. Nice” Society; don’t look at
the puffs in Miss Towsle’s hair; over-
look that fact that Miss Out—o—Style's
waist was bought ﬁve years ago-just
remember that you are all-daughters
of Pittsburgh and here for a common
purpose.

Then step in-to the front line and
demonstrate your capability to ac-
complisli results. _

The men are lagging. Opportunity

is at hand. Willy you embrace the

When I think, of that anniversary
celebration getting closer as the days
whiz past, I wonder what the stu-

President Taft, university and col-
lege dignitaries galore! The ‘biggest
thing Pitt ever did! i " -
’ It do_esn’»t matter whether you be-
lieve we are actually one hundred and
twenty-ﬁve years old or not——I don’t
hold that opinion myself and it seems
absurd to convert the attitude of the
community. The thing for the stu-
dents to accomplish is a resolve to
attend every session, regardless if
personal prejudice. ’

I was talking with Chancellor Mc-

Cormick the other aay and I men- I

tioned this same ’topic. The charac-
teristc reply a la McCormick was;
“No real man can afford to miss a

It was a cheering relief to shorten
the weekly ﬁnancial prayer - meeting

The Junior Prom on February 15th
promises to be an immense success.
Every student should be there and
partake of it.

How about a combined Junior ban—‘

quet? Such an arrangement would be
no doubt, satisfactory to the men‘on
the “Farm,” but how about the men
in the other departments?

‘for the Freshmen and a means of pro-
moting the welfare of the school. The
-committee has made arrangements for
a beautiful souvenir program to be
presented to the students. A list of
speakers will be printed on the pro-

gram. The price of admission will be

50 cents, which includes. a light lunch.

ing such spirit and many prominent

‘students have expressed their sympa--

‘thy with the Freshmen in this work.

Visitors Lead at End of First
Half but Pitt Wins at Finish;
Campbell Plays Good Game;
Cheering Features Contest

 

Before 2. large crowd of Gold and
Blue rooters and P.'A. A. members
the Pitt ﬁve won from the Western
Reserve University team by a score of
34-28. The opposing players were sev-
eral points ahead until near the last
part of the game, but by a desperate
spurt the Pitt players-forged to the
front and the Reserve boys were
forced to acknowledge defea-t. The
cheering of'the Pitt rooters was prob-

ably the deciding factors of the game, A
as the snappy cheers put new life into.

the players and aided them in over-
coming the slight handicap that Re-
serve had gained early in the game.
Cheerleader Kirk put a lot of volume
into the cheersand the game sounded

more like a football contest than a-

basketball game.

The Cleveland players seemed to
have better team work than Pitt, but
did not seem to be as good physical
«trim as their opponents and towards
the last of the game were forced to
play a defensive game. The Gold and
Blue players guarded well and fol-
lowed the ball closely.

The Cleveland aggregation scored
first -but Pitt tied the score when Mc-
Dowell pumped one into the basket
following a missed foul goal by Frisb-
man. The game was nip and tuck
until the end of the first half which
ended 19-18 in favor of the Reserve

players and it looked like an even ﬁn-

ish with the edge in favor of the op-

ponents. Frishman and McDowell led A

in scoring for Pitt in the ﬁrst half,
getting six ﬁeld goals between them
while Kalish starred for the Cleve-
landers. - ‘ .

I Pitt appeared at the start of the sec-
ond half with several substitutions

and displayed splendid ﬁghting spirit ‘

and aggressiveness. The teams were
tied when the 25'mark was reached,
but Pitt slowly forged ahead and when
the ﬁnal wh-istle blew were leading by
a safe margin of six points.

Hubbell, the star track man of
Western Reserve, proved himself to be
about as "good a man on the basketball
floor as on the cinder path, but was
forced to retire late in the game on ac-
count of a broken nose. Pitt seems to
be a hoodoo to this college as her ath-
letes seem to sustain -injuries ‘every
time they appear in -Pittsburgh. Three
of Reserve’s best men were so, injured

Harley Campbell played the best
game for Pitt, while Ochsenhirt, Gra-
Cap-
tain Walter Campbell played a good
game at guard. Pitt's greatest weak-
ness lies in the fact that she has no
good foul goal shooter. Frishman is
a. splendid shot in the open,‘ but can-
not toss them from the foul mark, and
he is about the best man on the team
in this respect. Several members of
the team seem to betryingqmore for:
individual ﬁeld goalirecords than isl
necessary. Team work is the only wayi
to win a basketball game or any game?
in fact, and if one/player sees one of
his fellow men isin a better positionl

ball. This trait will disappear after a!

and Lehigh, expecting to play several
of these colleges on the Penn trip,
which game will be played on May 3.
The prospects for track are bright
this year as there are many men in
school who have made good at Inter-

-ischolastic meets and who intend to

work hard for collegiate honors. The
schedule includes an indoor meet held
by the P. A. A. at Duquesne Garden
on March 9, the Penn relay games at
Philadelphia on April 27, an interclass
meet early in May, the Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate A. A. meet at Harris-
burg on May 18 and the seventh an-
nual intercollegiate track and ﬁeld
meet to be held at Trees Stadium» on
May 25th. Several other meets are
pending and it is probable that Pitt
will" meet either Westminster or W.
& J. in a dual meet away from home.

The gymnasium will be ready for
indoor work in about two weeks, so
that the men will have plenty of time
to prepare for the P. A. A. meet and
the outdoor track will be completed
by the first of March. Theseisplendid
facilities are expected to give the Uni-
versity the greatest team on the tracl<
that they have ever had.

A Time-Honored Contest.

The man who was passing the base—'
ball grounds paused interestedly.

‘‘What’s that row about over by the
fence?” he asked of an undersized,
spectacled lad who was looking on
from a safe distance. » I

“Sir,” replied the boy sedately, “you
no doubt heard of the age-old conflict
between the haves and the have-nots?”

“Yes,” returned the puzzled in-
quirer, “but what ”

“Well, this is merely a li-ttle skirm-~

ish between the have-nots and the

SAYS COLLEGE MEN
' ARE BIGGEST CROOKS

 

(Continued from Page 1)

In part Judge Linsey said:

“There is no institution that is per-
fect or that gets as far along in its
development as it would like to get.
The church, the col'lege, neither is per-
fect. , ‘

“In my experience in public life and
in the capacity of a judge I have found
that the worst crooks and thieves have
been college men: but I, also,’ found
that some of the best men have been

out to be a crook is a more dangerous
crook than a man that has not been
to college, for he is much keener. The
man that has been to college and de-

able to make something of himself
than if he had not been to college.
“Too often it is the case that the
big crook gets oﬁ‘ without proper pun-
ishment, while the small offender gets
the full extent of the law given to
him. The man that takes your purse

puts through a ‘franchise that is not
right is not stealing from one person.
but he is stealing from everybody.
“After all, it is not so muc‘h the loss
of money that is of so much impor-
tance as the loss of character. The
developing of character is the
great duty of the church and the col-

colleges must furnish the training.
“The world cannot ‘be saved by force
alone—force is the poorest way to get
the best results that there is. The
other power that will win the world is
the power of love. Sympathy, pa’-
tience, truth, love—these are the forces

_ by which the world will be won.

_“In juvenile court one day I said to
a little boy: ‘If I let you go this time
will you promise not to steal again?’

“‘Sure.’ he replied. I

“ ‘Why won’t you,’ I inquired?

“ ‘Because you will send the oﬂicer
after me again.’ H

“ ‘Can you give a better reas-on for
notstealing again?’ I said to another
little boy.

“"Because I will get a whipping,’ he
said. ,

“ ‘Is -there no better reason?’

“ ‘I know,’ said a little boy.

“ ‘Well, ‘my little m._an, what is it?’
said I.

“ ‘I will go to

half the lesson. There is such a thing
_as doing right for the sake of doing

of the lesson.

“Very often it is the case that it
hurts to do the right, and many per-
sons are not willing to suﬂier for -the
right. Very often it is, also, the case

what is right goes over to the side of
the corporation.

“The great need of the country to-
day is to have men in positions of

honor and trust that have a re.al deep‘ .
sense of justice and men that have the ,

c-our.age to do the right, no matter

what theqcost of doing righ-t may be. -

Justice must be above all else, and

the colleges of the United States have‘

a great duty to perform in training

men to have this highly, developed

sense of justice.

CAP AND GOWN PRACTICE.

Last Thursday evening the first act
of the Cap and Gown play was read.
Many of the Freshmen signiﬁed their
intention of trying -for parts. This
will make two or three trying for each
part, as many of last year's men have
been assigned parts. The dances were
rehearsed and much improvement was
noticed. There is still room for more
candidates. Everybody will get a
s'how. I

GLEE CLUB GETS NEW SONGS.

The Glee Club has added several
new songs to the already large reper-
toire. One of the new ones has the

amusing titl'e of “She‘s Losing .’Eni,"“

which will undoubtedly become very
popular with the students. The air is
decidedly catching and may be heard
about the corridors wherever a mem-
ber of the club happens to be. A num-
ber of good concerts have been sched-
uled, among which are the following:
University Club, Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, Pennsylvania College for
Women and Wilson College. T

ARRANGEMENTS FOR

At a meeting of the Junior Prom
Committee, held at the Phi Zeta Phi
fraternity house on S.aturday,'ﬂnal ar-
rangements for the big social event
of the year were completed.

The Hotel Schenley ball room has
been selected as the place where the
Prom will.be ‘held. The admission to
the Prom this year will be $3.50. In-
vitations have been issued to every
student in Pitt, and the committee
expects to eclipse every Prom ever
given in the past, both in the elegance
of the Prom_ and the number of stu-
dents in attendance. V.

The list of patrons is rapidly being
ﬁlled and when this has been done
the committee will have , completed
every detail for the 1913 Prom.
