About 50 prospective rushees assembled in the SU Ball-
room last Wednesday for the Winter Smoker and to hear
Mark Bebko, IFC president; Parker Enwright assist. dean of
men and fraternity advisor; and Bill Chapas, Rush chairman

and master of ceremonies.

Bebko called the fraternity system the missing link

Movie Version

Shown’ Tonight

This Friday evening in Clapp
Hall the Student Union Film
Series will present the movie
version of Herman Wouk’s Pulit-
zer Prize novel The Caine Mutiny.
T h e Stanley Kramer — produced
technicolor ﬁlm stars Humphrey
Bogart, Van Johnson, Fred Mc-
Murray, Jose Ferrer, and E. G.
Marshall.

It was released in 1954 and
was nominated for numerous
awards, including “Best Picture
of the Year.” Showings will be
at 7:30 and at 10:00 and there

is no admission charge.

Film Series chairman, Stan
Schweiger, advises everyone who
plans to attend this week to be
there as early as possible in order
to get a good seat. Last week’s
crowd was one of the largest in
the history of the Film Series,
and many were annoyed because
all the seats had been taken.
Schweiger warns this week’s pro-
sp‘ tive crowd to come early.

at the, University. Enwright said
that Chancellor Litchﬁeld has
committed himself to including
fraternities in the future of the
University. He also hinted at the
possibility of a fraternity row in
the near future.

“Fraternitiesiare not going out”
Enwright commented about ru-
mors to that effect. “Since 1946,
for every one fraternity going out
18 others have come into exist-
ence.” iEnwright added that a
clean rush is the fairest thing and
expressed hope that everyone
concerned will bear it in mind.

Booths Set Up

The party then moved to the"
adjoining room where 11 frater-
nities had set up booths for the
benefit of the rushees. A central
table on the podium served as the
registration booth for the rushees.

Chapas, Bebko, and other
Greeks were unanimous in their
opinion that the snow had kept
most rushees away from the
smoker. Bebko disclosed’ that last
year there were 60 men for Win-
ter Smoker and that tonight there
were 49, all dormitory students.
The missing ten were the com-
muters that stayed away because
of the snow.

Chapas announced that anyone
who was unable to come to the
smoker tonight due to inclement
weather can still register to rush
at the Dean of Men’s Olﬁce and
also sign up for various frater-
nity parties. They may also attend
the stag Smoker at all the frater-
nities next Wednesday. . -

Students Still Smoke
In Spiteof Report

By BOB DEQUINZE and JACKI KATZ.

In spite’ of last Saturday’s reportistating that cigarette
smoking was a signiﬁcantcause of lung cancer, chronic
bronchitis, and cancer of the larynx, few University stu-
dents have expressed the desire to give up smoking. '

Some students have or are intending to switch to a pipe,
while others have cut down the number of cigarettes they

smoke during the days. For the:

Rafael Kulaelilr

most part, though, students are
continuing to smoke the same
number of cigarettes as they have
been.

Knows Smoking Is Bad

Linda Love, a sophomore in
nursing, has been smoking for
several years and smokes between
a half a pack and a pack of
cigarettes a day. “I’m not going to
stop smoking because of the re-
port. I’ve known that smoking is
bad for my health and this report
doesn’t make that much differ-
ence.” _ -

“You can only die once, and
this way _you can pick your
way,’? are _ the sentiments of
Dick Marshall an engineering
senior. A smoker for three
_years, Marshall does not in-
tend to stop.

Stephen Lewis, a physics jun-
ior, feels that the report “didn’t
bring out anything new and that
it simply classiﬁed what scientists
have been saying for years.”
Lewis predicts that the report will
not have more than a ﬁve per cent
effect on the overall tobacco sales.

Recommends Pipe

“I have been smoking a pipe for

the past six months and cutting

down on cigarettes,” Lewis said..

He intends to recommend pipe
smoking to his friends.

Carl Gruggel, a senior Eng-
lish major, doesn’t doubt the
report but feels that “more re-
search should be done so that

Enables Education Grads to Earn Degree

Internship Program Provides
Graduate Teaching Chances

By ANN HARRISON
As part of the “Opportunities for Graduate Study”

pro-

gram, Paul H. Masoner, Dean of the School of Education, will
talk on graduate work in Education Monday at 3:30 _p.m. in

-1228 CL.

One of the programs of the Graduate School of Educa-
tion is the Graduate Teaching Internship. QDr. Maxine
Roberts, director of the program and coordinator of the ele-
rmentary school division, says that “while the internship
program was designed primarily to provide an opportunity

for liberal arts graduates to enter‘

the ﬁeld of education, it also_en-
ables education graduates to earn
their M. Ed. degree and perma-
nent certiﬁcation in a shorter time
than otherwise possible.”

This is the height of the recruit-
according to Dr.

secondary school division. He says
that applications made now can be
processed by April, “which will
give us an opportunity to provide
space in our summer program
(liberal arts ‘graduates only) and
in teaching positions in quality
schools in the fall.” There are a
number of positions to be filled,
“especially in the maths and sci-
ences,” he added.

Although the program has two
for liberal arts
graduates which takes about 13
months, and one for education
graduates which takes about 11
months, they are the same except
for the extra two-month summer

_ session in which the liberal arts

graduate, who has not had student
teaching practice like the educa-
tion graduate, must take certain
education courses before he can
teach.

Interns teach full time for
one semester or half-time for
two semesters and receive
$2,200-$2,500, which is half the
salary of beginning teachers,
from the public school system.
They are considered regular
teachers with the full respon-
sibilities that accompany any
teaching position.

In addition to the six credits he
gets for teaching, a liberal arts in-
tern must take 36 credits, and an
education intern, 30. These credits
are distributed among three cate-
gories: foundation courses, i.e.,
the history, philosophy, and psy-
chology of education; courses re-
lated to the development of pro-
fessional competence; and gradu-
ate study in the academic disci-
plincs.

Requirements for admission to
the internship program include a
minimum overall QPA of 2.5 (4
point system) in undergraduate
school, achievement of an accept-
able score on the University of
Pittsburgh Graduate Students Ex-
amination or the Miller Analogies
Test, and satisfactory ratings in
interviews with three faculty
members of the School of Educa-
tion and with‘ representatives of
the cooperating school system.

All interested students are en-
couraged “to come up and see us
as soon as possible” about the in-
ternship program, concluded Dr.

Roberts, 2617 CL, and Dr. Fran-»

cis, 2628 CL. Dr. Karl’ Oerman,
2633 CL, will answer questions
about physical education. Those
interested in business education
should see Dr. George Anderson,
2501 CL. Other information can
be found in the “Fellowship. Cor-
ner” in the Reference Room, sixth
ﬂoor CL.

EXHIBIT '

A collection of ceramics,
fabrics, oils and water colors
by Pittsburgh artist Charlotte
Hogg will be exhibited through
Jan. 31 on the 26th floor, CL.
The gallery is open for public
viewing Monday through Fri-
day, 9 a.m..to 5 p.m.

Pittsburgh Opera

Opera Star, will make his Pitts-
burgh Opera debut Jan. 23 and
25 at Syria Mosque. He will sing
the role of Alvaro in the Pitts-
burgh Opera premiere of Verdi’s
opera “La Forza Del Destino.”

American born and trained,
Tucker made his Metropolitan de-
but in 1945 and has since ap-
peared in leading opera houses

Which Students Wear A Badge?

Pinkerton Detectives On Prowl

To Reduce Losses In‘ Bookstore
By LARRY BERNFELD

Pilfering at the University Book Center represents
one percent, or 10 dollars on every thousand dollars
worth of sales.

John A. Balagna Jr., General Manager of the Uni-
versity Book Center, is particularly annoyed because it
is the little stuff that is taken.

“Why would a scholarship student want to jepardize his
position by stealing $1.90 of merchandise?” he remarked as an
example of the pettiness that characterizes most shoplifting.

We Give Beneﬁt of Doubt I

“We tell our staff that we wish to discourage pilfering. The’

only apprehensions that are made occur when a person walks
right out of the store when we know he is carrying unpaid mer-
chandise. We try to give everyone the beneﬁt of the doubt.”
At the beginning of the trimester, customer traffic is
unusually heavy and all staff personnel are needed to aid
the customers. The book center has therefore been forced
to hire Pinkerton detectives at the cost of ﬁve dollars an
hour per man. This amounts to- $60 per day per man during
the early trimester rush.

Most losses occur in the form of small supplies — pens,
erasers, etc. -— and paperback books. Customers have tried,’ to
walk out with supplies and books in their pockets, belts and
purses. Others try to‘ switch price tags on books and are con-
tinually amazedto ﬁnd out that the cashier knows what has
happened.

Safeguards catch only a small percentage of the thefts,
'but they do serve to slow down the total ﬂow considerably.
No alarms are used however, and Balagna took out the turn-
stiles when he came to the center because they make cus-
tomers uncomfortable and he personally does not believe in
them. ‘

Balagna stands against prosecution. Any reporting of these
occurrences goes to where the responsibility lies —- the offices
of the Dean of Men and Dean of Students.

The level of pilfering remains fairly constant over the years.
Many students don’t realize that it is going on. Students should
be aware, Balagna said, that the cost of pilfering is reﬂected in
the selling price which must cover the cost of merchandise and
operating expenses.

ANY STUDENT with a touch of
larceny in his heart had best
beware when he attempts to
practice his trade in the Book-
store, because there are Pinker-
ton detectives hired by the Uni-
versity watching for thieves.
This man may not be a cop, but
then again, who knows?

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schrweiger

  

Engineers & Sgcientisitsi

Currently making the rounds of the late night movie
shows on television is a 1940 comedy called “My Favorite
Wife.” It stars Gary Grant and Irene Dunne and in its
day was a major comedic triumph. Now, 23 years later,
the people at Twentieth Century Fox have taken that
sophisticated bit of nonsense and have remodeled it to
suit the talents of Doris Day and James Garner. The
latest remake is called “Move Over, Darling,” and it
falls shy of the original by a few lengths. ,

There is no gretting around the fact that Doris Day’s
name on a.marquee spells s-u—c-c-e-s-s. This year has also
been a major one for James Garner. So naturally it
ﬁgures that these two popular stars, thrown together
on the screen, would spell m—o-n-e-y. It worked for the
“Thrill of it All,” but in “Move Over Darling” something
is missing. This‘ comedy falls into that category known
as “one-gag” situations. Everything that happens, all
of the dialogue, and every directorial trick used by
Michael Gordon, are subordinates to the one gag. After
a while that gag just ﬁzzles out. _

Simply told, the script involves a young woman who
has been missing for ﬁve years and returns. to ﬁnd her
husband remarried. It seems like a ridiculous situation
right" from the start and the treatment by Hal’ Kanter
on this occasion is rightfully ridiculous. Doris Day plays
the returneeto civilization who returns home to ﬁnd
that her children do not recognize her and that she has
been pronounced dead by a judge on that very morning.
To make matters more ‘interesting, James Garner has

"just married Polly Bergen and they ’are off on a honey-

moon trip. Miss Day is enraged, spits her venom, and
decides to recapture her lost spouse by using every
devious device in her feminine composition. She gets
help" from her mother-in-law, played with the right

A amount of drollness by Thelma Ritter. Of course, things

turn out for the best and as with every other Day-dream
the happy couple smooch it up until “The End” has been
ﬂashed on the screen. _

I -hope not to evoke many tears and sentimental
sighs in pointing out the fact that “Move Over Darling”
is" a new name for ‘a picture that was started a year and a

half ago titled “Something’s Got to Give.” If that title

sounds familiar (aside from the Johnny Mercer tune), it
should. - ‘

Thisvwas the .ﬁlm that the late Marilyn Monroe was I
working on at the time of her death and from which.

has «resulted in mucho publicity for the beautiful corpse.
Miss Monroe posed for some revealing nude photographs
during the ﬁlming and these can be seen in the latest
Playboy. With the demise of the beautiful blonde bomb-
shell, the picture was scrapped until Doris Day’s hus-
band-producer‘ Martin Melcher decided that here was an-
other good vehicle for his talented wife. .
Miss Day wasn’t sure at ﬁrst whether to follo

in thefootsteps of the enigma known as Marilyn Monroe
but she ﬁnally adhered to the pleas and a million dollar
check from 20th and the re-make of the re-make was
started. Garner replaced Dean -Martin and Bergen re-
played Cyd Charisse both of whom were inked alongside
Miss Monroe’s signature. The ﬁnal result is cute and

cuddly, but the signs of a rush—job are clearly to be-

seen. The supporting cast of Don Notts, Chuck Connors
and Elliot Reid do their best to alleviate the single gag

burden of the picture but the good moments do not come‘

as often as one would expect from _a Doris Day comedy.

The touch of al Stanley Schapiro, A Paul‘Henning, and a I
, Ross Hunter are missing from “Move Over Darling” and

so are the other Iniversal-Intgernational elements.
The acting is cute and Miss Day has done a better

_ job than Miss Dunne did in the original. Mr. _Garner is

no Cary Grant as yet but is well on his way to ﬁlling The
Amazing One’s shoes. Polly Bergen is a nice looking
young woman whooveracts a bit and that is the crux of

the whole pict'ure’s faults. Too much overacting and‘

over-direction spoil this cinema brothbut I’m sure" many
people will ﬁnd it delightful and amusing in many spots.

"The"Negro revolution of
-1963” is a term being bandied
about by newspaper columnists
and news analysts. This term is

tion of 1963,” ‘
imagines
that something,

ended in 1963
after a big

' a big change.
_ None of these things are true.

» The civil rights movement start-

ed long before the 1960’s; in fact
:it’s origins predate the 20th cen-
tury. But most important, how-
ever, is the fact that no big
change has occurred}. And pre-
-cisely because there has been no
big change, no Negro revolution
in 1963, the civil rights struggle
will continue after 1963, and in

' order to succeed,‘ the movement
, 'will have to gain more momen-

tum than it has now.

_ A. Phillip Randolph and

Ever since the federal report on the effect of smoking on the health of the Amer-
’ . ican public made the front page of every paper in the country last weekend, therehas
been much conversation locally ce,ntering,on this important development, for there is
’ no more fertile market for cigarette sales than the college community. ,
_ However, even with the announcement that cigarette smoking is a basic factor
' «in over 70 per cent of all cases of lung can cer, it is very doubtful if the’ smoking habits
of the great majority of students will be affected to any signiﬁcant degree. Of course,
, it is at present quite common to hear‘ vows of: “I’ll never touch another one as long as
 I live,” and-“It’s cured me forever,” but then again it is also just as common for stu-
dents to claim that they can’t quit smoking, that they refuse to quit smoking, or that
they’re not worried about cancer. ” i

' The ﬁrst of these statements is of course foolish../
habit, requires only 'a generous outlay of w_illpower on the part of the individual for
him to reform. The same is true of the student who refuses to quit. He just thinks
that he can’t quit, and doesn’t wish to admit hislack of self control. . .

, However, it is the third individual who stands the best chance of retaining the
habit inspite of any or all reports which advise to the contrary. The student who re-
fuses to believe in his own vulnerability is the toughest nut for- the physicians to
crack. The comment “I’ve been smoking for seven years and I’m still as sturdy as an
elephant” displays a frame of mind rather difficult to inﬂuence. "But then "again it
seems to be a common mental disorder am ong men in that they believe that it cannot
happen to them — the It in this case being, of course, cancer and those innnumerable
~ other diseases now so solidly linked with cigarette smoking. ‘

That is why it seems rather unlikely that a signiﬁcient percentage will give
up the weed. Sales may drop for a ‘period of time, as sales of any product tend to do
in analagous circumstances, but just as ra pidlykthey will again rise because people
believe themselves invulnerable. . , '

V The great majority of people can no more be scared into giving’ up a dangerous
pastime than they can be rationally convinced of its dangers. If cigarette "smoking is
as dangerous to life as the report seems to indicate then" it is only right that the
United States government take action to prohibit the sale and distribution of the. prod- '
--uct throughout the republic. To do so is only fair; not to do so would be a crime.

born, Randolph called for and
led a March on Washington for
civil rights. That venerable
socialist leader, Norman Thom-A
as, who was too weary from
too many battles to march in

Washington in 1963 —. but he .

camealong in a wheelchair —
toured the South during the
1930's encouraging black and
white“ together to join the
Sharecropper’s Union. The
blacks and» some poor whites
sangthe same reworded Bap-
tist hymns then as they sing
now.

The 1930’s, however, wasn’t
the ﬁrst. time that an alliance
between the poor whites ‘and
blacks had-been attempted. The
Populist movement in the 1890’s
in parts of the South was very‘
successful. Their success, how-
ever, and the threat of black and
white together brought on Jim
Crow segregation patterns and
the disenfranchisement of the
Southern Negro. Today many of
the SNICK and CORE workers
and leaders are once more -talk-
ing about trying to win the poor
white to the cause.

When viewed from an his-
torical perspective, the civil
rights movement today sings the
same songs, confronts the same
problems, and desires the same
goals as it did 30, or in some
cases even 60 years ago. It is
true of course, that there has
been progress. Especially en-

the progress we have made; in
fact, these people have somehow
managed to convince themselves
that 1963 was the year of the
Negro Revolution. _
The Negroes have been ﬁght-
ing for' equality for a long
time. Their goal was not real-
ized in 1963 and it won’t be-
realized in 1964, and it might
not be realized by 1984. The

cry of _the civil rights move-.
ment is _“now”; the rallying
call of the arch-segregation-
ists is “never.” Depending upon
the strength of the civil rights
movement among other fac-
tors, the answer may be soon,
or it may be much, much later.
What I am saying is that vic-
tory will not come automatic-
ally simply because the move-
ment. seems to be riding the
wave of history or because it
has right on its side, and more
important, contrary to, what is.
implied in the term the Negro
Revolution of 1963, the pro-
blem is nowhere near being
solved.

The success of the civil rights
movement will entail a basic
transformation in American so-
ciety. As a preliminary example
of how complex the total pro-
blem is, imagine, (and I realize
this takes. quite a bit of imagi-
nation) what would happen if
the state and local governments,
including the Southern ones,
with the help of the federal gov-
ernment, suddenly embarked on
a crash. program to eradicate
inequality and segregation, both
legal and defacto in our schools
and to establish a really ﬁrst-
rate educational system. This
very, very expensive program by
itself would have little effect on

the position of the "Negro in '

American society. In my next
few articles I intend to discuss

Death of Foreign. Aid: Part 'II

The Taboo Subiecf

o By Jim  Kieinberg

Some of the alleged “frauds” connected with the foreign aid
program are worthy of note as being great accomplishments of
imagination and human creativity. One of the best was the one
about wife—buying in Kenya. According to this popular tale,

”  United States foreign assistance paid Kenyans
$600 to buy extra wives. This unusual appli-.
cation of foreign aid has been touted as the

- truth by innumerable sources since about 1958,
when the story ﬁrst become circulated.

The truth of the story is that in the early
ﬁfties Great Britain undertook a loan program

ﬁin Kenya (still a colony) designed to help
small businessmen and traders expand their
operations. One such Kenyan businessman,
after receiving the loan, used the funds to enjoy
a pleasant vacation with a woman other than
_ his wife. When the United States undertook
a similar program in Kenya, special efforts were made to avoid
such incidents. The history of the United States small loan opera-
tion has been a successful one,’ and misuse of funds on the part
of the Kenyans has not re-occurred. This seemingly harmless
tale has cost the various aid administrations countless hours and

Vpaper printing and re-"printing the truth. In ‘fact, the story has

become well-known in Washington among foreign aid supporters,
and it never fails to provoke a sad shake of the head. .

What the story illustrates, and there are otherslike it, is
that two developments are taking place. The ﬁrst development
is that through constant distortion and half-truth, it is pos-
sible to discredit the foreign aid program, regardless .of how
well it is managed. It is "possible now for people to have

‘ so little confidence’ in this effort that they would rather turn
over the administration of aid to a “multi-lateral” agency.

It is paradoxical, if not baffling, to read this multi-lateral
“solution” to the “aid mess” from the same people who would
ﬁght to preserve every ounce of,our national sovereignty. The
Reader’s Digest advocated just this in an article this summer
where, after distorting the Food-for—Peace Program, and insinu-
ating that the AID agency was inﬁltrated with both incompetents
and “comsymps,” the author suggested thatwe turn our foreign
assistance effort over to a multi—nation organization. A '

This development, tied in with the ﬁrst, was the lack of
information to the public about foreign aid. The fact that
not one television network, not one major magazine, not one
major newspaper or newspaper syndicate had done a. thor-
ough story on foreign aid showed how taboo the subject
had become. '

Even sadder, there were, and are, thousands of Americans
working in unpleasant surroundings, diﬁicult environments, and
hostile areas of the world for the foreign aid program. There are
thousands in Washington working long hours to administer the
program without waste and with greater precision and skill. In
doing this complex task,’ these. people know that they cannot
be sure if good programs will die because of funds curtailment.
They cannot be sure ofitheir administration, because low morale
drives talent out and away from AID. They cannot be sure of
Congress, which_has failed .to be honest with the program and
defend it. They cannot be sure of their countrymen, who are
apathetic and uninformed. To them, those dedicated to the. idea.
of development, foreign aid must be dying. Unless Congress, led

Non-Smoker Comments

Robert Pressman, a junior in
Liberal Arts, is currently a non-
smoker, having stopped a year
ago. He feels “that the ﬁndings are
_very signiﬁcant. I thing that it is
up to each individual to read the
report carefully and evaluate it in
terms of his own health, especially
those who are contemplating
starting to smoke.”

Two women students have
stopped smoking since the re-
port was made, but they claim
that they didn’t stop because
of the report. They are Linda
Besaha, a senior in chemistry,
and Mary Jane Yankocy, a Lib-
eral Arts ‘Junior.

Miss Besaha said that the report
was frightening, but that she had
intended giving up smoking any-
way. Miss Yankocy said that
“there have been so many reports

in the past year and this is just-

énother of a series.”

Cadets Host Wrestlers;
Panthers Seek 2nd Win 

By FRANK SMIZIK
Wrestling coach Rex Peery doesn’t plan any changes in
his starting lineup against Army at West Point tomorrow,
but several challenges have been issued. to some of the
starting wrestlers and if theé
challengers are successful Peery
will revamp his lineup according-
1y_ ‘i :5 :3:-:-:<.- -

his spot. The loser will wrestle at
either 157 or 167—pounds depend-
ing on where Tom_Baily wrestles.
Two other challengers for
starting positions are Tony

will take on regular Duff Killian

Bodle will try his luck against

but Peery feels he will be ready

Army is missing two of its top
wrestlers, from a team that lost
to the Panthers last season 21-6,

Mike Natvig and 191—pound star
Ray Nickla.

The most solid and consistent
wrestler on the Army team this g
season is captain Ed Winborn.‘
He will be one of the top men
Panther Clair Riley will meet
this season at 137-pounds.

Looking at last year’s meet it
can be surmised that Army will
need more than Winborn to pull
out a win over the Panthers. Out
of nine matches the Cadets only
won two — one by Winborn and
one by Natvig. Six Cadets who
lost will be back to try again.

seems like the year the streak

will be broken.

gantown on VVednesday, and
appear ready for the Panthers.

schools is tied at 49 games apiece. Last year the two
teams split one point decisions.

Mountaineer coach George King still plays the type
of fast-breaking basketball that has made West Virginia
great in the past. He has the tools for a winning combin-
ation, but hasn’t seemed to have found it yet.

Six—foot-8 Lowry is the Mounties outstanding
player. He is averaging over 15 points a game and ten
rebounds. Earlier in the season he was scoring over 20
points a game, but lately there have been times when
he didn’t hit double ﬁgures.

Lowry is supported by 6—foot-8 Tom Camp, 6-foot-5
John Lesher, 6-foot-6 Mike Wolfe and 6-foot-4 Bill
Maphis in the front court.

Ricky Ray and Buddy Quertimont have been seeing
the most action at guard, however, Don Weir and John
Cavacini should also see some service.

As usual Pitt will have a height disadvantage. Paul
Krieger will have to contain Lowry as he did last year
at Morgantown, and Brian Generalovich will have to
show the same form he has his last two games, scoring
21 and 23 points.

‘ The 23 point game came on Wednesday as the
Panthers defeated Bucknell, 75-60. Although held to
only ﬁve points the ﬁrst half, the General couldn’t be
stopped in the second.

As in the Penn State game, he repeatedly drove to-
ward the basket, faked, let the defensive man commit
himself, and then either layed it up or took a short jump
shot. ’

Pitt trailed throughout the ﬁrst half, scoring seven
in a row at the conclusion of the half to tie the score at
29. Bucknell stayed with the Panthers until there were
only eight minutes left in the game.

With the score tied 55-55,‘ Pitt outscored Bucknell
20-5 for the ﬁnal total. Besides . Generalovich’s .23,
Cal Sheffield had 15 and Dave Roman 14.
