Transplant patient

awaiting new liver

By Mindy Boffemmyer

(‘Ne ws Editor

Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal has told the family of liver
transplant candidate Pollie
Smolinski that she is next on the
waiting list for a donor liver but
did not say when a liver would
be available.

Frank Racziewicz of Presby
Health Sciences News Bureau
said, ”lt’s just a matter of when
a compatable liver becomes
available. it could be tomorrow,
it could be next week, it could be
four weeks from now."

Raymond and Ersley Eldridge,
parents of Pollie Smolenski, said
yesterday that Pollie is anxious to
return to her family in Hallie, Ky.

Smolenski has been waiting in
Oakland since May 17 for a
donor liver, and she hasn't seen
her children since. .

Raymond and Ersley Eldridge
said they plan to bring Smolen-
ski’s children, Matthew, Heather
and Randall, back with them to

visit their mother when they
return to Kentucky.

Ersley Eldridge said, ’’I wish it
would hurry. Pollie does, too.”

The family had been living in
a 10-foot by 7—foot camper in an
Oakland parking lot before they
were discovered by University of
Pittsburgh campus police officer
Jesse Long.

There was no free housing
available at Presby. ”There just
aren't enough rooms at Presby for
patients waiting for transplants,”
Raczkiewicz said, ”and they told
the hospital they had adequate
housing."

The Pitt Housing Office made
arrangements for the family to
stay in two rooms in the Litchfield
Towers. Then, the manager of the
Fairfax apartment building, Judy
Ray, offered the family the apart-
ment in which they are currently
living.

The family has also received
offers of assistance, including

Philanthropist dies

The University of Pittsburgh
community was saddened by the
loss of Leon Falk, Jr., who passed
away at the age of 86, last Thurs-
day of a stroke.

Falk is best remembered for his
50 year committment to excel-
lence at Pitt, highlighted by the
creation of the University of Pitts-
burgh's Falk Clinic.

Pitt has benefited greatly from
the philanthropy of Falk. His pro-
grams generated in excess of $10
million into the college's various
medical, political and artistic or-
ganizations.

In addition to his work at the
university, he also dedicated him-
self to helping all people. Falk

spent the better part of the 19305
aiding Jews in their flight from
Nazi Germany.

During this time he also peti-
tioned. Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo to permit Jews to emigate
to Dominican Republic.

Falk was born in Pittsburgh in
1901. He attended Yale Univer-
sity and graduated in 1924.

Dr. Falk leaves behind his wife,
Loti Grunberg Gerard, his daugh-
ters Ellen Falk Hirsch, Sara Falk
Moser and Susannah Falk Shop-
sin, his sons Sigo and David Falk,
four stepsons, a stepdaughter, 26
grandchildren and seven great-
grandchildren.

At approximately noon on
Tuesday, Pitt campus police
apprehended a man for at-
tempted car theft, only to later
learn that he had five outstand-
ing warrants for his arrest in
Peters Township.

Pitt Police Officers Ron Ben-
nett and Dave Kirchner ob-
served and subsequently
detained Robert Steele for
breaking into the automobile,
located on Pitt campus.

Steele will be released from
county lock—up today and
placed in Peters Township
police custody. He will await
trial in Peters Township for
parole violations.

According to Peters Twp.
Police Captain Gene A. Fetty,
Steele will be arraigned for the
car incident as well as five
counts of receiving stolen
property.

Residents arrested for noise

By Mark Merlin

For The Pitt‘ News

Early Sunday morning, campus
police officers arrested two Pitt
students for disorderly conduct
on the fifth floor of Tower C.

Officers received a loud distur-
bance call at approximately 2:40
a.m. from an unidentified resi-
dent in Tower C, according to
Walt Waters, assistant director of
campus police.

Eric Magobet and Calvin
Brown were arrested and given a‘
non-traffic violation for disorder-
ly conduct. Waters said they can
either pay a fine between $35 to
50 dollars within 10 days or fight
the incident in court.

”The police report says that
Magobet and Brown used profan-
ities directed at police officers
when asked to lower their mus-
ic,” said Waters. ’’Also, they
were disturbing others in the resi-
dence halls and smelled strongly
of alcohol.”

Magobet refused to comment
on the situation, but Brown said
the university police over-reacted
to the situation and refused to
treat him with respect. ’’I was
seduced by petty authority,”he
commented.

Two residents on the floor,who
wished to remain unidentified,
said they could hear loud noise
coming from their area of the
floor. The residents pointed out

that this is not an uncommon oc-
curance, but the resident assistant
keeps the noise level low.

Waters said that usually resi-
dents will
when asked to by police. ”These
incidents are usually isolated.”

According to Jon Conlogue, the
assistant director of residence life,
”approximately 1000 communi-
cation reports are filed each year
in the residence halls. Most of
them involve negative actions
committed by students, but few
incidents require campus police
involvement."

Conlogue also pointed out that
the resident assistant on the floor
was not on duty at the time and

Heidinik jury selection to be completed soon

cancer of the lungs, liver and‘.

(AP) —— The judge denied two
motions by Gary Heidnik's attor-
ney Tuesday to again move the
site of jury selection and to se-
quester the panel before it moves
to Philadelphia to hear the
"House of Horrors” murder case.

Heidnik, 44, is accused of mur-
dering two women and torturing
four others last year in the base-
ment sex dungeon of his ram-
shackle Philadelphia row house.

Abraham, citing the extensive
media coverage the case has
generated, earlier agreed to the
defense's request that the jury be
selected outside Philadelphia.
The state Supreme Court then
chose Pittsburgh for jury
selection.

Ten jurors were selected Mon-
day afternoon and Tuesday morn-
ing, and two more, plus the
alternates, must be picked before
the trial can begin, probably next
Monday. _ ,

Heidnik is accused of murder-
ing two women and torturing
four others in his rowhouse
basement.

Survivors of the so-called
”House of Horrors” said they
were raped repeatedly, had
screwdrivers stuck in their ears
and were fed dog food before
they were freed. Authorities said
frozen body parts also were
found in the house.

Most and perhaps all people who

Auto plant saved by
cooperative venture

WEST MIFFLIN, Pa. (AP)
General Motors Corp. said Tues-
day it will invest $20 million in
a local labor-management plan to
salvage a cramped, 38-year-old
factory for GM’s first plant dedi-
cated to making replacement
parts exclusively.

Up to 900 of the plant's 1,700
employees will be retired or

transferred as production is
halved and shifted from new
parts for GM’s Buick-Oldsmobile
Cadillac division.

The remaining 800 to 1,000
workers will be ”spared the axe"
under GM’s overall plan to
eliminate 30,000 jobs and close
16 plants by 1990.

Tobacco, asbestos
combination deadly

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ In an un-
usual twist on lawsuits filed by
cancer victims against tobacco
companies, a federal jury is hear-
ing evidence that asbestos and
tobacco, when combined, have
a far d.ead|ier effect than either
does separately.

The suit was filed by the estate
of John Ray Gunsalus, who
smoked two packs of Pall Malls
a day and worked at shipyards
where his work sometimes left
him covered with dusty asbestos
particles.

Also a heavy drinker, Gunsalus
had three heart attacks during the
1970s and was diagnosed with

Columbia prof discusses today's medical ethics

By Heidi White

For The Pitt News

Should abortion be legal? How
should organs be distributed
among transplant patients? Does
a patient or his family have the
right to refuse medical treatment?
These questions were addressed
recently by Dr. David J. Roth-
man, director of the Center for
the Study of Society and Medi-
cine at Columbia University.

Rothman lectured on ethics
and medical technology in rela-
tion to civil liberties at Pitt's
School of Public Health.

Sponsored by the American
Civil Liberties Union, Rothman
addressed topics such as organ
transplantation, genetic engineer-
ing, abortion rights, termination
of treatment, surrogate mother-
hood and psychosurgery.

Rothman said, ”Medicine is
really changing and has, in the
past several decades, changed
what we mean by life, what we
mean by liberty and the pursuit
of happiness. I think that the
changes brought on by medicine
are fundamental, and if we don't
cross over and start taking on
these issues, then we are missing
some very, very critical areas.”

As far as termination of treat-
ment goes, Rothman believes
”abortion and psychosurgery
were the easy cases.” Now
modern medicine brings on more
confounding cases where it is
much more difficult to determine
where autonomy stops and med-
ical wizardry takes over. ’’It raises
the potential of state intervention
which is going to be presented,

not in the guise of control or of
limiting liberties, but instead in
the guise of helping, or doing
good or in the guise of welfare.”

Rothman believes we have a
”somewhat restricted” right to re-
fuse medical treatment. ”Fifteen
years ago, the real problem was

patients not being listened to; my
fear now is that patients may be
listened to a little too quickly 
so yes, a right to refuse treatment
but — with a very large BUT
I don't think if a patient says it
then that's [the end of] it! I think
that it's much more complicated
than that. But on the other hand,
I certainly am not trying to advo-
cate a return to the old days of

medical paternalism — where
doctor knows best and the patient
is sick and compliant — that

won't do either  it is not sim-
ply ’My body -— my say’ because
you may not be making the right
decision... .”

There has been much con-
troversy surrounding organ trans-
plantation procedures.: do we
have things to say about fairness
of procedures? Do we have

‘T I ‘ I‘ I‘ - . .
____ ,_, , ., , , ,;,,__._ .. . ...-. .. . ...._ .  -.-

things to say about the potential
for discrimination? Does a right
to life include a right to a new
heart? Does the possibility of not
being able to pay keep a person
out of line to receive a lifesaving
organ? What are the rules and
regulations here? Who gets to
make these decisions? This is
where the ACLU comes into
play.”

Some long-unanswered ques-
tions that Rothman believes the
ACLU should get involved with
concern state's rights. Does the
Government have the right to our
body parts after we are dead? Or
is dead,DEAD? Does a person
have the right to be buried with
his organs, therefore increasing
the shortage of organs and con-
sequently causing others to die
because they need the organs he
wanted to keep in his body after
he no longer needed them? This,
in a sense, could be saying that
the organs are ours on loan, but
when we die they become the
state's to use as they see fit.

Another question, according to
Rothman, that the ACLU should
address has to do with the right
to sell one’s organs. He argues
that the only party who does not
profit is the donor. The hospital
and the team of doctors are paid,
and the recipient of the organ is
allowed to live. The donor's es-
tate gets nothing. Rothman does
not believe the organs should be
auctioned off to the highest bid-
der, but he suggests they could be
sold. If a woman can ”rent her
own uterus” for surrogate
motherhood, then why can't a
donor's heirs gain a little from his

  

or her death?

Rothman feels that the ACLU
should get involved with the
government in making laws relat-
ed to these subjects because
Pennsylvania has virtually no
laws pertaining to transplanta-
tion, genetic research, monitored
human experimentation and sur-
rogate motherhood. ‘

Rothman is presently a Bernard
Schoenberg professor of Social

Medicine; a member of the board
of directors for the Mental Health
Law Project in Washington D.C.;
a fellow of the Hastings Institute
of Society, Ethics and Life
Sciences; chairman-of the ACLU
Committee on the Termination of
Treatment; he serves on the In-
stitutional Review Board, the Crit-
ical Care Committee, the
Neonatal Bioethics Review Com-
mittee.

Q: How can I tell if my hus-
band is really having a good time
during sex? He is so quiet about
it. I have a girlfriend whose lover
moans and groans and yells, so
she can tell he gets carried away.
Can a man keep so quiet about
it if he is really enjoying sex?

A: It isn't a question of what ”a
man” can do. Each man is differ-
ent, unique, within a general
male mold. Men are not Ken
dolls, or sex robots, or clones.
Your girlfriend's man is an in-
dividual; your husband is your
own special male. I am inclined
to think from the various testimo-
ny I have collected, that most
men don't really get as demon-
strative as your girlfriend claims.
She may be exaggerating. Or, he
may be dramatizing to impress
her. In fact, he may be faking —~

who fake climaxes for one reason
or another. Or it may be this

noises like elephants when he
reaches a crescendo. But your
husband can be very quiet and
still be having terrific sex.

I often get questions from wives
such as ”how can I give him a
better time in bed?” or ”how can
I give more of myself?” when the
male partner is having as good a
time as he cares to have. If he
isn't complaining, and if you are
enjoying sex with him, don't bor-
row trouble.

Q: I'm 78, and my boyfriend
and I want to move in together.
This is not to his parents’ liking,
nor mine. They think we should
get married or live apart. What
do you think? In your experience,
does living together work for
young couples?

A: I can't generalize about cou-
ples moving in together before
marriage or instead of marriage.
For some, it works — from 24

Smokers should
accept responsibility

For the first time in 30 years, a jury has ruled that an illness
caused by cigarette smoking was at least partially the fault of
a tobacco company.

In a case anti-smoking groups are calling a ”break in the dam”
for suits against cigarette makers, a Federal jury awarded
$400,000 in damages to Antonio Cipollone, the husband of
Rose Cipollone, who died of lung cancer. On the other side
of the dispute, cigarette companies are claiming that the deci-
sion was only a minor inconvenience because the charges of
conspiracy to misrepresent facts and knowingly mislead the pub-
lic were dropped.

Mrs. Cipollone, who began smoking before the .1965 Feder-
al Statute requiring cigarette companies to print warnings on
tobacco products and advertisements for tobacco products,
claimed in a deposition taken before her death that Liggett ads,
calling their cigarettes "just what the doctor ordered" and

O ”safe,” led her to smoke.

‘Going to law school shouldn't be a life

.0

There are those who have expressed hope that this decision
will trigger further liability suits against the tobacco industry,
although the award did not cover even one-fourth the plain-
tiff's legal costs for the 5-year trial.

While we certainly cannot condone the ads in question -—
they were misleading — there seems to be something patently
wrong in claiming that cigarette companies are completely to
blame in smoking-related deaths. At the heart of the matter,
there is the question of whether a person should have the right
to abuse his own body. Smoking is not a habit forced on any-
one. There must be a conscious decision to begin. To say, af-
ter a death has occured, that an outside agency was responsible
for the death is to say that a person refuses to assume responsi-
bility for his or her actions. The freedom to choose, whether
choosing ahabit or a presidential candidate, carries with it a
responsibility to accept the outcomes of that choice.

They checked my identifica-
tion, fingerprinted me, and stuck
me in a hot room with 48 other
people. All of us quietly obeyed
as they seated us, one by one.
Most of the people stared straight
ahead and kept a stone-cold ex-
pression. I could sense a few
were scared. Yet, this wasn't the
place for sympathy or compas-
sion. It was survival. We were
taken there by our own choosing,
regardless of the terrible torture
they planned to inflict. Some
called it hell, they called it the
Law School Admissions Test.

Before that day, Monday, June
13 was only a circled date on my
calendar. How could I complete-
ly imagine its significance? Only
now I realize my confrontation
with the course of my distant
future.

The test moderators looked like
normal people. I'm sure they had
regular jobs, friends and family,
but they seemed to lack some-
thing human. Everything they
said was read from a booklet. I

wondered if they liked what they
were doing or if they would care
if I dropped dead -of a heart
attack.

Two moderators slowly walked
down the aisles dropping off
plastic-sealed LSAT exams on ev-
ery desk. I felt increasingly un-
easy and attributed it to the four
cups of coffee I had consumed 20
minutes ago. As I received my
booklet, something felt wrong, as
if I boarded the wrong airplane
going home.

I noticedmy feet were tapping
on the floor and I was gnawing
on my fingernails. We opened
our test booklets; I neatly lined up
my six newly sharpened pencils,
and unwrapped a fresh piece of
bubble gum.

”Begin,” the moderator said,
and the tune of Jeopardy sound-
ed in my head. The first section
was analytical reading. _I poured
all my education, concentration
and common sense into ques-
tions involving characters like

Theists have been leaders

My first response to Mr. Sa-
ment’s [column] (The Pitt News,
June 8) is that many theists did-
lead ”mankind out of the primor-
dial cave.” I could make a long
list of such people; scientists such
as Sir Isaac Newton, Gregor Men-
del and Robert Boyle; writers
such as Dante, Basho and I.B.
Singer; statesmen such as Asoka,
M.L. KingJr. and Milton —-whose
work ensures that we can debate
these issues. Such people found
that their ”superior supernatural
standards" called them to im-
prove this world.

However, Mr. Sament does
have a point. Most of the reli-
gious in this world are poor and
ill-educated. So is most of the
world. When the people in the
welfare hotels are offered jobs
and. schooling, they generally
take them. Their religion does not
keep them from trying to better
their lives. It tells them that the
accomplished in this world, who
do not use intelligence and
wealth and power to love their
neighbor, may lose their sereni-
ty and happiness.

Another possibility

I would like to respond to Mr.
Sament’s article ”They know not
what they say,” (The Pitt News,
June 8). If one follows the course
of theological reflection, one
notes that many categories of
thought were appropriated from
humanistic philosophy. Aristo-
tle's notions of perfection, im-
mutability, omnipotence, etc.
were used in an attempt to define
God.

A natural result was an inten-
sification of the problem of evil
in a ’’perfectly’’ created world.
Plato's stress on universals
(Goodness, Beauty, etc.) resulted
in a downplaying of the particu-
lars. Essence prevailed over exis-
tence, an earthly life was judged
inferior to an afterlife in the
Realm of Ideas.

Theological speculation in the
20th century has built upon the
insights of existentialism and the

process thought of Whitehead.

erasers before we hit the half-way
point. They allowed us a T0-
minute ”rest". I felt a strange urge
to run out laughing likeha lunat-
ic, buy a case of beer and head
down to Atlantic City. I settled for
a trip to the water fountain.

Fifteen minutes in to the se-
cond half of the exam, my ner-
vousness transformed in to
violent hatred of everyone
around me. Everyone seemed
like selfish, greedy, hungry
beasts, viciously tearing through
their exams for the self-
gratification of becoming law-
yers. I cursed the characters in my
exam, axing them into pieces
with my pencil.

Who the hell were these peo-
ple to judge if I could be a law-
yer? Most of the questions they
asked me were useless, boring
and had nothing to do with the
American legal system. Each
question attacked my ability to
reason, designed to trick me at
every deductive step.

An attempt has been made to
reclaim the understanding of God
known to Jesus Christ and the ear-
ly Christians. Judaism has defined
God as wholly other and yet inti-
mately concerned with his crea-
tion. Jesus continued this stream
of thought by affirming life, for-
giveness and reconciliation wi-
thin the context of a human
community.

God was seen as One who
calls man forward to a brighter fu-
ture in the dawning kingdom. He
attempts to lure man by integrat-
ing our values with our own.

Faith in a God who is author of
growth and progress does not re-
quire the sacrifice of intellect but
precludes it. The problem of evil
arises as man holds on to his past
or tries to operate in an eternal
present. Man must be open to
changes in himself and his world
which will lead to greater free-
doms and benefits for all. Some-
times the old must be sacrificed,
such may involve a measure of
suffering for the unprepared.

It didn't seem fair; what if I

What then? My childhood

We came to the last section

I never had any childhood

wasn't even interested in law un-
til I went to college, as much in-
terested as I was in journalism,
acting and psychology.

Perhaps I was over-reacting.
Perhaps the most terrifying part of
choosing a career isn't the possi-
bility of failure but of success.

As college students, our deci-
sions only entail the scope of a
course description guide. Yet,
when we choose our career, we
do not have the luxury of easily
dropping the course. We make
sacrifices.

Maybe the time isn't right for
me to make sacrifices. Taking the
LSATs made me realize that I
don't have much time left, and
that, for anyone, could be some-

Roaming the halls
of The Carnegie

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Contributing Editor

The Carnegie is presenting a
new exhibit that would make the
Flintstones proud. The Dinosaurs
Alive exhibition will be displayed
at the Carnegie Museum of
Natural History from June 19
through September 25.

These half-size, life-like
dinosaurs, created by the Dina-
mation lnternational Corporation
of California, open their mouths,
twist their bodies and move their

- forelegs freely. The creatures are
_able to move their tails and

heads, take steps forward and
backward and have breath and
eye movements. Their movement
is powered by compressed air
pumps and controlled by com-
puters.

imagined dinosaur sounds, der-
ived from modern reptile vocali-
zations, are created by digitized
recordings and synchronized
with mouth movements.

According to Tina Calabro of
The Carnegie’s Media Relations
Office, ”They imitate what

dinosaurs might have been like
millions of years ago.”

The dinosaurs will be displayed
in a setting that resembles their
natural habitat.

Buhl Science Center will spon-
sor special dinosaur activities in
conjunction with the exhibit, in-
cluding two robotic Dinamation
creatures and a planetarium sky
show entitled ”Disappearance of
the Dinosaurs.”

Admission to Dinosaurs Alive
also includes entrance to the Car-
negie Museum of Art and Muse-
um of Natural History, which
features Dinosaur Hall, one of the
country's most outstanding col-
lections of fossilized dinosaur
skeletons. Eleven different genera
are on display in Dinosaur Hall,
which is visited by over 200,000
people each year.

The museum's dinosaur collec-
tion was begun in 1898 when

Shedding tears of joy because it's Always August

Always August
Geography
SST Records

Always August's third album sounds as if they have
been wandering the same bluesy flatlands that Santana,
Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead once trod in
the late 60s. Sketches of Jorma Kaukenon and Jerry Gar-
cia abound without falling into the depths of derivative.

Side one of Geography begins with the Santana-esque,
percussion—driven ”...Flat|and.” Shards of guitar inten-
sity thrusting from the speakers push aside any miscon-
ception that Always August is just a throwback to Electric
Kool-Aid'Acid Test. Competitive lead interchanges be-
tween bassist Tim Harding and guitarists Lee West and
John Kiefer are frequent. Always August is heavily into
jamming out. The four songs on this EP total over 23
minutes — there must be some heavy rocking going
down.

On ”Sama Layuca,” bassist Harding proves that some-
one can still jam out like Jack Cassidy. He conjures an
enticing pattern that cruises ”Sama Layuca” into a
groove around which guitars and sax intermingle into
a snakedance of electrifying proportions. Walking a slim
line between ”Baxter’s” Airplane overkill and pure bril-
liance, Always August manages to stay one step ahead
of monotony. At times, ”Sama Layuca" even sounds
reminiscent of Miles Davis's Bitches Brew because of
sax—man Tom Wall's wailing riffs.

”Mesa” and ”One Straw Revolution” have roots in
”Workingman’s Dead.” ”Mesa” is a cool acoustic rocker

Please see August, page 7

Tuck & Patti
Tears of loy
Windham Hill

It may be unfortunate that Tears of loy, the debut LP
of the gifted jazz singer Patti Cathcart and her inventive
guitarist, Tuck Andress, is on the Windham Hill record
label.

The greater part of the Windham Hill catalog consists
of impressionistic and politely tedious recordings; the
10 soulful and immediately likeable love songs on Tears
of loy refute the deserved Windham Hill stereotype of
self—important, comatose elevator music. If they remain
trapped in the record store bins consigned exclusively
to Windham Hill products, Tuck & Patti may never reach
the larger jazz and sophisticated pop audience they so
obviously deserve.

This remarkable album is sure to please. Of the three
original compositions on the album, two of them, the
title track and ”Everything’s Gonna Be All Right,” are
unrelentingly swinging work—outs as polished as any of
the standards that fill out the album. While surely not
yet in the same league as the unrivalled Sarah Vaughan
in the interpretation of standard ballads such as Rodg-
ers’ and Hart's "My Romance," Patti Cathcart’s vocal
performances reveal a sensuous and engaging dramatic
sensibility reminiscent of Vaughan. Cathcart’s controlled,
gospel-tinged interpretation of Cyndi Lauper's spare bal-
lad ”Time After Time," which builds and builds to an
ecstatic climax, is something close to a revelation.

On the very fast and funny ”l’ve Got Just About Every-

lt's summer again, and the heat is sweltering. But this
year, the weather isn't the only thing that's hot in Pitts-
burgh. The local music scene is burning with new
releases and I'll Tell You What Man from The Clarks is
a definite scorcher.

The Clarks’ debut album typifies what is meant by
rough, fiery rock ’n’ roll. .

The opening cut ”Hesitating" grabs the listener, and
the remaining tracks strengthen that hold. ’’In the End”
is a moody piece featuring Greg Joseph's rhythmic bass,
Dave Minirek’s powerful drum, Rob Hertweck’s sting-
ing guitar and Scott Blasey’s gritty vocals. ”Pretty as You
Please,” with Minirek’s pace-setting opening drum solo,
is a catchy tune filled with energy and spunk. Round-
ing out side one is ”Help Me Out,” possibly the best
cut on the album.

Side two highlights The Clarks’ diversity. ”On My Way 3,.

Back Home" is solid rock with thoughtful lyrics, while
”l’m the Only" is a playful song with a good dance beat.
The acoustic guitar gives the folky ’’All That Much” an
honest, earthy feel. *

The fire and passion often present in their live shows
hasn't been lost in the studio. On their album I'll Tell
You What Man , The Clarks have successfully
reproduced their energetic sound. The album is full, fast
and spirited rock ‘n’ roll. -

Creamer fired by Penguins’ management

(AP) —- The Pittsburgh Penguins
fired Pierre Creamer after one
season as head coach Tuesday
and finally went public with their
search for his replacement.

Creamer, 43, led the Penguins
to a 36-35-9 record, the team's
first winning season in nine years;
but that was still not good enough
to make the Stanley Cup playoffs
with Mario Lemieux, the league's
leading scorer and its Most Valu-
able Player. The Penguins
finished last in the Patrick Di-
vision.

”They wanted to find a big
dummy for not making the
playoffs and they chose me,”
Creamer said. ”We had a good,

positive year in Pittsburgh.”

No replacement was named
Tuesday.

But Tony Esposito, Penguins’
new vice president and general
manager, reportedly discussed
Creamer’s job with several can-
didates at last weekend's NHL
draft in Montreal. Esposito said he
hoped to have a new coach by
July 4.

Among reported candidates
are: Eddie Johnston, the Pen-
guins’ former general manager
and former head coach from
1980 to 1983; Gene Ubriaco, a
minor league coach and a child-
hood friend of Creamer’s from
Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario; Rick

Ley, coach of the Penguins’ farm
team at Muskegon, Mich.; Jac-
ques Martin, fired last month as
coach of the St. Louis Blues; and
John Paddock, coach of the
Philadelphia Flyers’ farm team at
Hershey.

Esposito announced Creamer’s
firing ”after long and careful con-
sideration” and after a private but
well-publicized morning meeting
with him at Pittsburgh's Civic
Arena. 1

”Pierre is a good hockey man
and knows the game. However,
he has had some problems in the
area of communications,” Esposi-
to said.

Basketball camp's enroll

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Although the college basketball
season has been over for better
than two months now, the Pitt
men's coaching staff won't be
spending the summer ”golfing or
laying out in the sun,” as Panther
assistant coach Norm Law put it.

Far from it, actually. The annu-
al Pitt Panthers’ Basketball Camp
for boys and girls aged 8-18 be-
gins next Monday, and the
coaches are expecting their lar-
gest turnout since Paul Evans be-

came the Pitt head coach three
years ago.

”The camps are going good as
far as enrollment," said Law, also
the camp director.

There will be four camps of five
days each this year, running be-
tween June 20 and August 5.

”We expect 220 campers the
first week, 380 the second week;
we hope to get 200 the third

‘ week, and we hope for 150 the

fourth week,” said Law.

Law said enrollment for the
summer camps has increased dra-
matically over the past three

years, from 500 campers in 1986
to 550 in 1987, and to an estimat-
ed 800 this year.

These camps are nothing new
to the Pitt coaches. ”Pitt’s had
camps for at least 10 years," said
Pitt director of ticket sales and
promotions Kimball Smith. ”All
the coaches at Pitt since Buzz
Ridl have had camps. But they've
really become popular since Pitt
joined the Big East,” Smith
added.

Although these camps would
give the coaching staff an easy
opportunity to see future talent,

lished reports of a poor relation-
ship between Creamer and his
players.

Several unidentified players
said Creamer was aloof and arro-
gant, and he was unaware of the
need for a victory in the Pen-
guins’ next-to-last game of the
season against the Washington
Capitals on April 2.

’’I had good communication
with the players,” Creamer said.

But he said later that some
players had "input” into his fir-
ing because ”they’re the ones
who sometimes judge you.”

”My way of coaching didn't get
along with some players,” he said
finally.

The Penguins are expected to
pay off the remaining two years
of Creamer’s contract, estimated
-at about $100,000 a year.

”|t’s not like he's getting two
weeks’ severance pay.”

Creamer’s firing was not unex-
pected. His status had been tenu-
ous since mid-April, when
Esposito, who was named to the
Hockey Hall of Fame on Mon-
day, was hired by the Edward J.
DeBartolo family to improve the
play of the franchise, which has
not been in the playoffs since
1982.

Creamer was conspicuous in
his absence at Saturday's NHL

Vasvary pleased with
results, leadership
of men's track team

Despite a series of debilitating
injuries to Dave Moore, Lars
Hummel, Paul Friedrich and
Dave Price, Pitt men's track
coach John Vasvary was pleased
with the progress made by the
1988 Panthers and is optimistical-
ly looking to the future.

”We were especially pleased
by the performance of the young
kids and several upperclassmen,”
commented Vasvary.

Several individuals were sin-
gled out by the coach for their ef-
forts. According to Vasvary,
”Seniors George lfill and Calvin
Holmes were super in their role
as leaders on and off the track.”

Tom Boggan and Glenn Rhines
were recognized for taking time
out to work with younger mem-
bers of the team, while junior Eric
Cannon led the way on the track
in meet after meet.

Sophomores Chop Burton and

captured the Big East 400-meter
title but qualified for the NCAA
meet in the event as well.
Mike Stratos culminated a fine
year by capturing the javelin
throw at the Big East Champion-
ships this spring, while Friedrich
battled back from injury to clock
a time of 8:58 in the 3,000-meter

Law said they are not run as
recruiting camps. ”These are in-
structional, fundamental camps.
Campers are put in groups ac-
cording to their age and ability.”

The campers gain valuable ex-
perience. from not only the Pitt
coaching staff, but from high
school and college coaches from
around the country.

”Our staff is all involved,” said
Law, ”but there are coaches com-
ing from all over the country.”
This year's staff includes coaches
from New York, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan

run at the |C4A meet. That same
time at the Big East Champion-
ships would have put Friedrich in
the winner's circle.

One of the finest efforts of the
campaign came from freshman
Neil Malobicky in the |C4A meet,
where he ran a 47.3 opening split
in the 1600-meter relay despite
never running better than a 49 se-
cond 400—meters in high school
last year.

Vasvary is eagerly anticipating
what his young team can accom-
plish in the future. With return-
ing standouts Cannon, Ellis,
Moore, Price and redshirt Lee
McRae (eligible for the outdoor
season next year), as well as solid
performers Boggan, Rhines,
Malobicky, Cornell Brown and
Tom Brookover, the experienced
Panthers will be on the prowl.

”Our young guys grew up fast
this year with the injuries we
suffered. Having experienced
performers on the track always
has a calming effect on younger
teammates. That way the energy
is burned in their legs and not
their head,” observed Vasvary.

Pitt's coach feels the Panthers
had an excellent recruiting year.
Among the standouts recruited by
Pitt were Sam Rice and Brent
Shield.

Rice is a sprinter who ciocked
one of the finest indoor dash
times in the high school ranks this
past year for Cardinal Hayes High
School in New York City.

Shield is a hurdler from Harris-
burg High School who captured

and Florida.

Included on the staff will be
Blackhawk High School coach
John Miller, father of Pitt point
guard Sean Miller, and George
and Austin Lehman.

The staff usually includes guest
speakers from the pro ranks, but
Law said he is not yet sure who
will attend these camps.

All instruction during the
camps will take place in Pitt's
Fitzgerald Field House.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 15, I988

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —
Kent Tekulve of the Philadel-
phia Phillies says boredom is
the enemy.

The durable 41-year-old was
placed on the disabled list
Monday for the first time in the
reliever’s 14-year major league
career and his overall 19-year
professional career.

 -I-, The Phillies said Tekulve is

suffering from a strain of his
right shoulder. He has been
placed on the 15-day disabled
list, dating from last Saturday.
The Phillies replaced
Tekulve on the 24-man roster
with right-hand reliever Brad
Moore from their Reading
farm in the Class AA Eastern
League. Moore was 2-4 with
seven saves and a 4.01 ERA in
25 games at Reading.
Tekulve ranks third on the
all—time list with 969 games

.““~ pitched, all in relief. He is 2-4

this season with three saves
and a 3.93 ERA.

Tekulve said he first injured
the shoulder in early May and

Tekulve sidelined

started treatment May 9. He
said he kept pitching because
Steve Bedrosian was still
recuperating from walking
pneumonia and the team
needed him.

”The shoulder simply ran
out of strength,” Tekulve said
Monday night. ’’I haven't been
able to do the things I wanted
to, throw effectively.”

Tekulve was unsure how he
would take his first dis-
ablement.

”It’s a unique experience for
me,” he said. "I don't know
how I'll react. I'll probably go
nuts.”

The pitcher said he kept go-
ing as long as he could be-
cause he felt pressure from a
bullpen short of talent at the
moment.

”I had one good inning and
then had nothing in my sec-
ond inning,” he said. ”It came
down to where  I had about
40 pitches in my arm. I need
25 to warm up, which left me
15 for the game.”

Creamer-

After Esposito arrived, he did
not meet with Creamer for two
weeks and then did not invite
him on a scouting mission to the
Memorial Cup junior tour-
nament.

They wanted to find a
big dummy for not
making the playoffs
and they chose me.

Creamer joined the Penguins
after coaching the Montreal
Canadiens’ minor league affiliate
in Sherbrooke for three seasons,
guiding his team to the Calder
Cup Finals twice. His record at
Sherbrooke was 120-104-1'4.

He also coached the Junior
Canadiens in the Quebec Major
Junior Hockey League for four
seasons, when his overall record

 was 165-105-6.

He was the Penguins’ ninth
head coach in the franchise's 21
NHL seasons. He was hired by
the Penguins on June 4, 1987.

NCAA keeps quiet

The NCAA has yet to announce
if it will officially launch an inves-
tigation into allegations made by
former Pitt tailback Craig Hey-
ward that he reportedly received
$500 from Pitt assistant coach
Frank D’Alonzo, as The Sporting
News reported in their June 13
issue. --

Heyward was allegedly paid to
wear a jacket bearing the insignia
of a Detroit—based company
while he was in Houston for the
Bluebonnet Bowl in December.

The NCAA said it was not their
policy to discuss a possible inves-
tigation of a ”member institu-
tion," according to the article.

Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik
filed a report on the charges with
the NCAA but refused to make
public any of his statements.
