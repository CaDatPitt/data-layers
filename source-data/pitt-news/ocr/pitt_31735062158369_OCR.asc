, Claimed To Be

Too Expensive

Demolition work on the Schen-
ley Theater, property of the Uni-
versity, begins today. Fixtures,
rugs, switchboards, and any usable
material from the theater will be
employed elsewhere in the Uni-
versity.

The Schenley Theater was orig-
inally purchased as part of the ex-
pansion program and was not to
be used as an auditorium on a
-permanent basis.

Temporary use as meeting hall
was considered but costs for’ re-
conditioning the theater were too
high to make the idea practical.

Due to the proximity of the

. theater with adjacent buildings,
demolition work must be han-
dled slowly and with great care.

Expected completion date of the
work is Jan. 15. A crane will be
moved into the theater to remove
the second balcony after which the
demolition experts will begin tear-
ing down the walls. .

The movie seats inside the the-
ater are available free of charge to
anyone who will cart them away;
They are not, however, in "their
original condition.

 

Rally W’ednesday

A pep rally, sponsored by the
Student Union Board, will be held
at noon this Wednesday. The rally
will be held in Bigelow Court —
weather permitting.

The University iVarsity March-
ing Band will appear with the

’ cheerleaders, and members of the

football team.

INTRAMURAL SPORTS

Men’s Council is forming an
intramural sport board. The
board's function would be to or-
ganize and supervise all intra-
mural sports at the University.
Anyone interested in working

1 on the Board should contact

Denis Lichtman of Men’s Coun-
cil.

Fund Drive Finishes
With Alumni Dinner

Leaders of Pitt, the University of Pennsylvania and Tem-
ple University have asked their alumni and civic leaders in
Pittsburgh to support a request that the Commonwealth in-
crease its ﬁnancial support to the three state—aided schools.

At a meeting in Schenley Hall, last Thursday, Nov. 20,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, President Gaylord P. Harnwell, of

Pennsylvania, and Dr.
Gladfelter, Provost of Temple,
explained the needs of their in-
stitutions and various
available for meeting them.

The Pittsburgh meeting was the
last of a series of nine gatherings
held throughout out the state to
acquaint citizens of the Common-
wealth with the needs of their in-
stitutions.-

Point Out Services

The three university heads enu-
merated the services which their
institutions render to the Com-
monwealth and to its citizens.

They pointed out that almost
half of the state's physicians
and lawyers, a majority of its
dentists, and most of its veteri-
narians are graduates of the
three universities. Nearly one
out of "three college and «uni-
versity students in‘the state is
enrolled -at Pitt, Pennsylvania,
or Temple.

The three educators pointed
out that among the 49 states and
the District of Columbia, Penn-
sylvania ranks sixth in income
per student from tuition, 14th in
income from grants and endow-
ments from private sources, and
46th in state aid per student.

Ask for $23,800,000

Chancellor, President Harnwell
and President Johnson said that
for the next biennium the three
institutions will ask the State
Legislature for a total of $23,-
800,000 to help meet expenses for
general maintenance. .

Of the new goal Pennsylvania

will ask for $9,377,200; Pitt,

$7,830,200; and Temple, $6,592,-

600. The money does not in-

clude requests for appropria-

tions to their medical and vet-

l\/lillardﬁ-~   

resources

, 4;}
crux:-11-_v schools.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld stated that ~

thz crisis in American education
is the result of two challenges
which it faces-—one the challenge
of Russian education, the other a
domestic challenge resulting from
the population increase in our
own country‘.
Example of Khazakstan

On the challenge of Russian
education, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
and -President Harnwell cited
their ﬁndings as members of a
group of American educators who
visited Russia this past summer to
study higher education in the
Soviet Union.

As a measure of the determi-
nation of the llussians, Chancellor
Litchtleld cited the case of the
Republic 0:’ Khazakstan. .

Forty years ago this area was
inhabited by a nomadic people
who were,90 per cent illiterate.
Today, nearly all these people
are literate. There are 27 univer-
sities in Khazakstan attended by
some 60,000 students. ,

The domestic challenge is the
expected “bulge" in the num-
bers of students who will be
seeking higher education. The
increased demand for college
and university education will
result from the greater number
of students entering elementary
schools. ,
To meet these challenges the
three universities are trying to
make more efficient use of their
existing facilities. Students and
private sources are doing their
share to help the situation. They
hope_the Commonwealth will in-
crease its support.

Convention

Of Phi Etas

A four man delegation rep-
resenting Phi Eta Sigma, the
national freshman honorary
fraternity, attended a bian-

‘ nual convention at the Uni-

versity of Wisconsin.

The two day convention was
in the Wisconsin "Center
Building with general business
and reports presented» and dis-
cussed the ﬁrst day. The delegates

‘were then put into special com-

mittees such as constitution, ritual,
individual
work to be presented tolthe con-
vention. ’

_Phi Eta Sigma was founded at

the University of Illinois and has
expanded until at present it con-

sists of 97 active chapters dis-
tributed throughout the country.
The local chapter was organized
in 1937. A

— The main purpose of Phi Eta
Sigma is to reward freshman
scholarship and ’ promote and
encourage scholarship to all
members of the University. Phi
Eta Sigma taps freshmen men
who have received a 2.5 Q.P.A.
for the ﬁrst semester of their
freshman year or a 2.5 Q.P.A.
for their overall freshman year.

The main activity of the local
chapter is to offer free tutoring
sessions to students taking the
freshman courses which present
difficulty. Several dinner meetings
are also held during the semester.

"The members who attended the
convention were: Dick Dodds,
Arts ’60, Sam McAllister, Arts ’60,
A1 Schoﬁeld, Arts’ 60, and Lee
Thompson Arts ’60.

The purpose of the convention
was to obtain information and
ideas of how the‘ local chapter can
promote scholarship on campus.

deﬁnite ideas about his future.

'“I wanted a job dealing with people

plained how much‘ emphasis the tele-
phone companies put on sales and

that was for me.”

Bob graduated" with an.A.B. degree
in Business in 1954, and went immedi-
ately with Northwestern ‘Bell Telephone
Company, in Omaha. Today, he is a
sales supervisor with seven men report-
ing to him. His group is responsible
for recommending and selling com-
munications, facilities like PBX switch-
boards, “hands” free” speakerpl1’ones

and “push button” telephone systems
for all kinds of businesses.

“This is selling at its best,” says Bob.
“Customers, respect the telephone com-
pany and the advice and service we can
offer them. So they welcome our visits.
And I’m getting valuable experience in
business operations and in supervision

Music vs. The Press

Gilels, cnbum,

, By John I.owen'|'lIol

Every now and then, to revive sagging public
interest, businesses demand of their press agents
that they create a focus_ of public attention, play
him up to be a sensation, and _quickly make of
him a .myth. The Yankees did this with Ryne
Duren, the movies with James Dean, and the
country with Dwight David Eisenhdwer.

But the ‘purpose of- this article isinot to spew

my discontent with the present administration; it
--is to discuss some creatures of publicity who have
appeared ‘in the last year in the ever-1nore-com-
mercialized ﬁeld of classical music. A
A couple of years back, the Kremlin and Dulles
shocked the world "by agreeing to a “cultural ex-
change.” One offche ﬁrst products of this exchange
was the Americem tour of Emil Gilels. Gilels was
not the first Russian/ musician to visit the United
-States; he had had a worthy predecessor in the

7 great violinist David Oistrakh.

The publicity men made “ ﬁne capital of
Oistrakh’s we1l—deserved‘ rave _notices and- set
forth Gilels‘ as his‘-pianistic ‘counterpart. Partly on
the ‘strength of the big’-build—up, partly because
of a curiosity as to whether a Russian is ‘a human

being, and partly-from a desire to showthewgrlde

that they arevbig-. enough to cheer for their ene-

- mies, people turned» out in tre'm,endous throngs to

hear Emil Gilels plaiyi ‘ - — ,
From coast.to_ coast he drew packed houses and
sour reviews. The critics were annoyed that his
managers allowed him, to playnothing but Tchai-
kovsky.‘ (It is a well-known fact that an audience

will always cheer long and loud for Tchaikovskyf

‘it is equally known that it _is quite impossible

 
  

Madison Ave. \

to judge a pianist by his playing‘ thereof.)

The critics were annoyed that Gilels did not 0

demonstrate any exceptional musicianship in his

K playing of Tchaikovsky. The connoisseurs were

disappointed in that when he departed from the
school of the Russian sentimentalists he ‘failed
dismally to project his work..

‘This year saw the emergence of the American
answer to Gilels. Van Cliburn rocketed to the
heights in the wake of the publicity which fol-
lowed his winning a huge Moscow piano contest.

.Cliburn has non—musical qualities which aided in

his development as a myth. He is the Texas long-
hair,» the Al1—Ainerican young artist.‘

He had won the acclaim of those who, inour
minds, would not give this’acclaim,_ readily. He is
a most pleasing personality. In short, ﬁne fodder
for the Madison Avenue cannons.

With the unpleasant image of another‘ Gilels ,

in mind, the critics joined the overflow crowds on
Cliburn’s recent tour, and came in for a suiiprise.
_.Cliburn turned out to be a genuinely ﬁnepianist,
one of the best of the young ones today. '
Alas, I—doubt that it was Cliburn's artistic
solidity which caused the advertisers to make of
him a phenomena. It was the publicity of the Mos-
cow contest dumped in ‘their collective laps which
urged them to carry on. On their next try they
will likely as not lay another egg. ‘ ' . ‘
Today, perhaps the ﬁnest pianist in the world,
Sviatoslav Richter, "is virtually unknown to the
western world and the Pitt-sburgh Symphony here
plays to half—empty Syria Mosque. The time has
"come-for higher standards of audience discrimi-
nation and less reliance on the press agent.-

supported his topic, which was,
-as thieiititle implies,
research. .
First, however, Entenberggave

theiaudience the following back- »

. ground inaterial, complete -with
the examples: , _ .
Advertising as. a whole is; con-
cerned with,the. right kind oi!
appeal. There are two basic
types of ‘appeals —- “rational,”
which aim at hooking thefcon—
sum'er with promises of depend-
ability, economy, convenience,
etc., . and “emotional,” which
‘ stress product associations lead-
ing to things like prestige, emu-
lation, individuality, or ,con-
formity.

Play On Whim .

The emotionak appeal, of
course, derives a great deal 0
its potency through the public’s
‘subconscious nature or »whims.
And here enters motivational re-
search, the prime emotional ap-
proach, which explicitly enables
the consumer to recognize and
satisfy his underlying desires. It
is purposeful psychology.

Sometimes symbols are used
that infer a sense of emotional
security. Good Luck Margarine
came out with a small fourleaf
clover trademark on one cor_ner
of the box. Eventually the clover
expanded until it‘ covered the
whole label. Sales doubled within

~ four months. ‘ ~ ~

under aiphase of mild mass
hysteria, buying things they
neither need nor want. '

In short, Packard holds that

consumers are buying values and"

they are the wrong values. En-
fenberg, however, disagrees. He
maintains that M. R. is -not _an
immoral influence for two rea-
sons.

First of all, we are living in
an economy " of over-abundance
whichdesperately needs distri-
bution methods. Only two—thirds
of our consumer capacity has
been absorbed since 1946. M.R.
is now a vital servant of distri-

. bution. --

Secondly, people seldom act

Letters To

Editor, The Pitt News:

‘In Re the “Beat Generation.”-

At ﬁrst I was a little amused
but then .I became disturbed by

I Miss Amdur’s front page criti-

- cism of the. Beat Generation.

‘The article, in_ the issue of Nov.-
10, 1958, gives the reader the
impression that the beat is a
rather‘ unstable person, dressing
in a loose fashion, and spending
all of his time floating around
in an opium-inspired dreamland.

The article does not stop there,
but goes on to imply that the
beat is making no contribution
_towards curing the inﬁrmities

admitted to be present in our

society.

Now either Mr. Culver has not
really observed the beat genera-
tion, or he has observed a non-
repr_esentative_ segment of it, for
his conclusions ‘are mos extra-

The Editor

ordinary and erroneous.

‘ The average beat is a student,
or a young professional, who
usually is learned not only in
his own discipline, but in others
as well. -

Further, the beats are not a
“passive” group, but actually are
making real contributions to-
wards the improvement of our
society. '

For this rebellion and for the
many ways in which these in-
dividuals struggle to better our
society, they have my admira-
tion. ,

In conclusion, the beat genera-
tion can best be interpreted as
a modern, progressive state of
mind or social attitude; and not
a cult of “childish” people whose

total desire in life ‘is to beg“

‘.‘cool.”

Library Group Tours New Stacks 0

Student Committee

To Make Survey‘
Of Volumes Used _

The Student Library Com-
mittee held its ﬁrst meeting
last week. They toured the
new track area in the location
of the old cafeteria. This
group, the ﬁrst of its kind in
in the University, is needed to
help with the manipulation of the
new stacks, to which the students
will have direct access. --

The committee will also help
in making surveys concerning the
number --of students using the
library and the books available to
them. It is felt'that the library
can serve the students better if
they contribute their viewpoints.

The ten members on the Student
Library Committee represent all’
of the schools that come under the
domain of the main library.

They are as follows: Nathan

. ’Maryn, Graduate School of Public

and International Affairs; Ronald
Bussey, Graduate School- of_ Re-
tailing; Nancy Robinson, Graduate
School of Social Work; John Ba-
rone, and Samuel Kamin,—School
of Business Administration; Mich-
ael Bilirakis, School of Engineer-
ing , and Mines; John Janeski,
Lenna A. Przeracki, and Morris
Stampfer, School of the Liberal
Arts; Patricia Privett, School of

THE CLOTHES You SAVE MAY BE YOUR: OWN

In this column we take up fashions for college men, which means

, of course, the Ivy Look. Toda.y’s Ivy Look clothes have made a

great stride forward. Not; only do they have thin lapels, three but-
tons, narrow trousers, and a minimum of shoulder padding, but
—now hear this!——this year they are actually covered with ivy!

This new devel_opm‘ent, while attractive beyond the singing
of it, nevertheless gives. rise to certain hazards. For instance,
people keep_.t1'ying’ to plant you on Arbor Day. Indeed, this is

precisely what happened to two SAE’s. of my‘ a.cqua‘intance,-

Walter R.'Gurlash and ‘l?red.Rasp. Before they could protest,
they were snatched up, planted, limed, and watered, and today
they support a hammock in Cut and Shoot, Vermont.

Let us now discuss-shirts. Again this year the campus favorit-e
is the good old Oxford with button-down collar and barrel
cults. This is without doubt an admirable garment, but let me

ask you.a question: if you don’t wear anything but Oxfords, .
what do—you do with all the cuff links people have been giving -

you for your birthday since you were twelve years old_?

_ Well sir, some fellows have their wrists pierced, but what E.‘
Mackenzie Sigafoos, a Chi Psi of my acquaintance, did was to
t-akefa dozen pairs of his handsome gold monogrammed cuff
links and string them together in a charm bracelet for his girl,
Jo-Carol Isobar.

(Itturned out, incidentally, ‘to be a mistake. In short order

‘so many admirers accrued to- Jo-Carol on account of her gor-

geous bracelet that she grew tired of plain old E. Mackenzie,
and one night when she was seated on a bench in Lovers Lane
throwing sticks for.E. Mackenzie to retrieve, she suddenly,

‘ cruelly, without warning, told him they were through. '

-‘fl am heartbroken,” said E. Mackenzie, heartbroken. "But
if go you must, give me back my charm bracelet’!

‘ .“No, I will keep it,” said Jo—Carol.

“What 'for??’ said E. Mackenzie. “You can’t wear it. The
initials on the cuff links are all mine—E.M.S.”

“Ha, ha, the joke is on you,’_’ said Jo—Carol. f.‘Yest.crday I was -
voted Miss Chinese Restaurant of 195 .’Z-

.“S0?” said E. Mackenzie.

“So,” replied ‘Jo-Carol, “E.M.S. does not stand for E. Mac-
kenzie Sigalfoos. It stands for Eat M ore Subgum!”

A brokenman, E. Mackenzie today squeezes out a meagre
living as a pendulum in Cleveland. Jo-Carol was killed in a
tong war.)

But I digress. We were talking about/well-dressed men, and the
one essential for every well-dressed man-—.a.nd every well-dressed
woman too——is a well-dressed cigarette—neat, compact, ﬂavor-
ful, and correct for work or play, sunshine or shower, repose or
revelry, darkness or light. And where does one ﬁnd suchn per-

’fect companion? Just go to any tobacco counter and ask for

Philip Morris. Ask for it in long size or regular. Ask for it in
soft packior hard. But ask for it; that's the important thing.
Don’t just stand there making cryptic gestures at your tobac-
conist. He may be armed. mm x... 5......

High-Scoringliions
Look for 6 th Victory

By FRANK PINKUS
This Thursday the Panthers will meet the Nittany Lions
in a game to determine the Commonwealth’s number-two
team. Nebraska already has won the mythical Pennsylvania

championship.

Both teams have identical
four common opponents. Penn
braska a two-touchdown favorite:

while the Panthers were favored
to win by more than three touch-
downs.

Both returned stunned by the
Cornhuskers. State, 14-7, and Pitt,
14-6. Both teams also lost to Syra-
cuse while the Panthers tied Army
who had previously whipped the
Lions 26-0. The Nittanies played
to a 14-14 deadlock with West Vir-
ginia, while the Panthers defeated
the Mountaineers, 15-8.

Series Begins in 1893

Penn State also holds victories
over Pennsylvania, 43-0; Mar-
quette, 40-8; Boston University,
34-0; Furman 36-0; and only last
week they whipped Holy Cross,
32-0. -

The Panther-Penn State se-
ries began in 1893 and was an-
nually played on Thanksgiving
Day until 1931. This year’s
game, the 58th, will kick off the
City’s Bicentennial and set the
stage for a year-long series of
sports attractions in the City.
,The Panthers have won 32, lost

22, and 3 games have ended in
ties. Last year’s game ended in a
14-13 victory for the Panthers.
They went into the ﬁnal period
trailing 13-0, but put together two
touchdown drives in the last quar-
ter with Norton Seaman converting
the extra point and giving Pitt the
victory. ‘
Stopped Greene

Last week the Nittany Lions
ﬁnally broke loose and ran over
Tom Greene and company with
ease. The resurging coach of the
Lions, Rip Engle, said, referring to
the Holy Cross game, “We ﬁnally
played the kind of football we’re
capable of playing.” In the past
State has been plagued by fum-
bles and dropped passes.

Panther End Coach Ernie
Hefferle, who has been scouting
State had this to say, “I watched
State against West Virginia and
Holy Cross and in both of those
games I thought they looked bet-
ter than we did.”

“They could have turned the
.West Virginia game into a rout
had they held on to the ball. They
ran Holy Cross into the ground.”

Line Is Strong

Hefferle goes on to say, “The
line is big. It moves well, blocks
well. Defensively, they’re very
strong. They gang up on you in
their tackling. It’s very seldom
that one man brings you down-
they always have two, three, or
four men to greet you.”

The backs that Hefferle most
fears are Left Half Dave Kas-
perian who leads Penn State in
rushing and scoring. Kasperian
has gained 356 yards, more than
any Pitt player, and has scored
seven touchdowns.

Botula Local Boy

The rushing runner-up is a
South Hills High graduate, junior
Fullback Pat Botula who has
compiled a 4.5 average while net-
ting 324 yards. The right halfback
is sophomore Jim Kerr who is
averaging 3.4 yards per carry.

Quarterback is probably the
strongest position on the team,

some impressive passing. The
third team quarterback is Bob

The ends are Norm Nefi and
Maurice Schleicher, who Hefferle
said are on a par with the Pitt
ends. The tackles, large 225-
pounders, Andy Stynchula on the
left side and Joe Bohart, are the
men the Panthers will have to
move if they wish to run with the
ball.

from 1952 through 1954.

From Collegian

The game between John

Rip Engle’s Penn State foot-
ball eleven will not be the
only grid event listed for this
Thursday_

A "ﬁrst” has been instituted be-
tween the newspapers of these
two institutions. At 9:30 a.m. at
the practice ﬁeld across from the

Field ‘House on Thanksgiving, a
six—man team from the Pitt News
will meet a similar group frornthe
Penn State Daily Collegian in a
two—hand touch game.

The aggregation from Univer-
sity Park will be lead by Sports
Editor Lou Prato and his capa-
ble assistant, Matt “As a Matter
of Fact” Mathews. “We will
show up with a strong team that
will be out to murder you guys,”
commented Prato last week.

Word from the Pitt News is that
the local journalists will more than
just show up for the encounter,
“Even if they are bigger than
our squad, we will simply outrun
them to gain our victory,” declar-.
ed Sports Editor Murray Chass.

_ The remainder of the local team
