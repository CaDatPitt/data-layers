Ohio State postponed because of
wet grounds, Pitt’s potentially pow-
erful 1941 baseball team will leave
Pittsburgh this afternoon for Char-

Worthingtorz Writes Poetry, Stories, Plays,
Cleans Houses, Acts, and Goes to School

At the University, Walter Worth-
ington is a student in Edwin L.
Peterson’s writing class.

At the Pittsburgh playhouse,
Worthington is no less a personage
than “De Lawd.”

To clear up this bit of heavenly
transition we might add that Wal-
ter Worthington is a promising
writer and actor who is at present
appearing in the leading role in
the production of Marc Connelly’s
“Green Pastures” at the playhouse.

Working as long as 20 to 22 hours
a day in his jobs as a contractor for
house cleaning work and masonry
jobs, in addition to an all night
shift at the College club. Worth-
ington said that he gets his sleep
all day Saturday, and by catching
“cat naps” whenever he can.

For the past ten years Worth-
ington has been writing plays,
short stories, and poetry. He plan-
ned to study law when Don Brown,
a former ‘graduate assistant at the

gs

WALTER WORTHINGTON
.  lawd!

University, convinced him that he
should be a Writer.

Since that time he had had nu1n-
erous works published, including
many which were staged by local
theatrical groups. The ﬁrst play
Worthington produced was “Inde-
pendent Hamilton,” which was pre-
sented by the North Side Civic
league in 1931. From then until
1935, most of his plays were pro-
duced by the Olympian Dramatic
players.

His acting, Worthington ex-
plains, is merely an outgrowth of
his desire to write. He declared.
“The best way to create fictional
characters is to live them on the
stage.”

Worthington’s aim is to make
enough money so that he can devote
all his time to his writing. “The
ﬁrst requisite for writing is time
in which to write,” he said. And
after ten years of writing only at
short intervals, he is not discour-
aged.

Dr. Bowman Will Head Local

. By FRED LANGE

' United China Relief Committee

Chancellor John G. Bowman broke a policy this year which had
become almost a tradition—a tradition that stood for 20 years. .

Since Dr. Bowman assumed the chancellorship of the University two
decades. ago, he has been offered several positions on iraridus committees

and commissions outside the Uni-
versity. But each request was re-
fused.

On Thursday, March 27, Dr.
Bowman broke his 20-year old rule.
He accepted the, chairmanship of
the United China relief committee
for Pittsburgh, the ﬁrst major non-
University activity since he be-
came head of Pitt in 1921.

Explaining his acceptance of the
chairmanship, Dr. Bowman de-
clared, “Some friends who have
helped when I asked them to do
things for the University have
asked me to do something for the
Chinese . . . The answer was easy
because I have a great affection for
and an understanding of the Chi-
nese people.” .

The problem in the Paciﬁc is
more critical than Americans real-
ize, asserted the chancellor. “These
Chinese do not forget things,” he
commented.

“We must put forth more effort
and more money, for times have
changed a great deal since the be-
ginning of the (Oriental) war.”

‘Dr. Bowman expects the Pitts-
burgh quota to be about $100,000.
The national United China relief
has set its goal for $5,000,000.

To create interest in the project,
dinners and luncheons will be
scheduled. Guests may be given
chopsticks to eat with and a rice
bowl to eat from, according to Dr.
Bowman.

The United States relief is a
union of several organizations for
aid to China, combining to make a
country wide, united appeal.

James G. Blaine, president of the
Marine Midland Trust company, is
chairman of the national campaign.
Wendell L. Willkie, Pearl S. Buck,
former Ambassador William C. Bul-
litt, David O. Selznick, John D.
Rockefeller, 3rd, and Colonel The-
odore Roosevelt Jr., are among the
directors of the organization.

Official spring recess will be
from April 7 to April 12 inclusive,
the oﬂice of the registrar an-
nounced today. Classes will be
resumed on Monday, April 14 at
8:30 o’clock. All University offi-
ces will be closed, Good Friday,
April 11.

This is the last issue of the Pitt
News until Wednesday, April 16.

All copy for the next issue must
be in the News ofﬁce by 3:30
o’clock Monday, April 14.

Arranges Banquet
For Observance

The Panamerican Club. of Pitts-
burgh will observe Panamerican
day, April 14 at a banquet in the

Memorial Committee Requests
Suggestions from Senior Class

A ballot box for seniors’ sugges-
tions for the memorial to be dedi-

cated to the University by the class
of 1941 will be located‘, on the
ground floor of the Cathedral, an-
nounces D. Ann Carrier, C41, co-
chairman of the committee for the
memorial selection.

Two suggestions are already be-
fore the committee: a stained-glass
window and a Seat of Honor. The
senior class of 1940 gave a glass
window which was placed in the
alcove opposite the Fifth avenue
entrance. “We could give a simi-
lar window for some other location
in the Cathe‘ral, on the first floor
or perhaps one of the libraries,”
Miss Carrier stated.

The proposed Seat of Honor
would be used on special occasions
as an honor for special guests. Ac-
cording to the committee, it would
establish a tradition of honoring
special guests in such manner.

. they want to stymie nati.onal defense programs,

foreign radicals that they are.

It was not o:.c.ly ironic that the report was

issued this  It

Planned either by

(1) The administration which wants to add
a bit of p.ro-labor color to the industrial pic-

ture, or by

(2) Senator LaFollet.te, who, like many

others, does not understand the administra-

tion’s present attitude toward labor, and, fear-
ing that President Roosevelt has reversed his

former policy, issued the report this week as

his small share to counteract the present trend.
At this writing the two big clashes on the
labor front concern 1’ai°faire coal (the oper-
ators and the papers call it a “walkout”; the

miners sa it’s a “lockout”) and the CIO inva-
Y

sion of Henry Ford’s River Rouge manor, the
largest industrial plant in the world.

In what direction the President will nod his
head in this dispute is hard to guess. Last
year, when he was still speaking with John L.,

he went over backwards and endorsed the UMW

demands for a union shop. But there is some
doubt whether he’ll spring for the dollar-a-
day increase asked this week.
The President has been grinding away at
the national defense-for-Britain program too
long and too hard to let a little thing like 400,000
miners stand in his way, even if he, liberal
. president that he is, personally favors the union
request. Another school of thought says that
FDR has returned to a Country Squire frame of
"mind, has ordered" the government pro-labor
propaganda turned off, and is ready to crack

. was probably planned.

ing that Franklin D. is a “The election’s over,
we don’t need their votes now” man.

Not to be dismissed, however, is the personal
element in the Roosevelt-Lewis relationship. It
must be remembered that the man with the
bushy eyebrows—neXt to W'endell VV. himself——
was the foremost anti-Roosevelt orator last fall.
And that man in the Vihite House isn’t letting
this slip from his memory.

The Ford situation is another doosie to ﬁgure
out. Especially with such examples of news-
Y‘

[*7

 reporting as carried by lnte1‘11atio1’:al Nexvs
 last ‘Nednesday in the Sun-Telegr:1ph:
.%.-ppa:‘cz1tly faked interviews (with  
me.ntiened) all placing the union in  bad light
accompanied main accounts of the stril-:e, head-
lir ‘-'.-vitli such slan’—.ied C‘I‘.l_3I..lO1’!S as “Ford
V.7Lii‘l<ers Battle Pickets in CIO E7/.;ril:'e.”

Why the auto workers used this ;:>a.ri:iculai"
time to attempt to smash the Harry Bennett
labor policy of Ford has produced a handi'ul of
theories:

John L. put the pressure on 'Widinan and
he Detroit U AW’ boys and demanded that they
time their walkout with that of the miners.

If the union organizes Ford, it will mean
the greatest victory for organized labor in the
country’s history. No other employer has so
elaborately thwarted efforts of workers to
unionize. But from present and past labor
policy and from ofﬁcial statements, Henry Ford
and Harry Bennett are not going to back down
and permit unionization, especially at this time
when they can use such a good excuse as na-
tional defense.

Pro-Ford American newspapers have molded
public opinion to an anti-union opinion so that
if a stalemate ensues, the government must take
the responsibility of settling the strike. Be-
cause Henry Ford is so determined in his poli-
cy, the government can do either of two things:
side with Ford, or back up the union.

If the administration chooses the latter
course, it will be necessary for the government
to take over the motor company, national de-
fensed by army blitz car contracts and an air-
plane motor factory which is scheduled to open
soon. Both Mrs. and Mr. Roosevelt have been
quoted to this eﬁect.

If the government sides with Ford, chances
are that Lewis will not take it lying down, but
instead call a general nation-wide CIO sympathy
strike.

Public opinion has been led to believe that
the present industrial slowdown is entirely the
fault of labor. This is the impression today.
This was the impression four year- ago when
the newspapers covered the Little Steel strike.

University Symphony Orchestra

Presents Annual Spring Concert

0 By Jean Garland

The University Symphony Or-
chestra under the direction of The-
odore M. Finney, associate prof-
fessor and head of the department
of music-appreciation, presented a
diversiﬁed program of unusual in-
terest for the annual home concert
in the Foster Memorial last Wed-
nesday evening.

Miriam Goldstein, C41, appeared
as piano soloist playing the first
movement of the brilliant Schu-
mann A Minor Concerto. Possess-
ing well rounded tones, Miss Gold-
stein played with ease and com-
plete assurance. The orchestra, too,
was in top form and the players
gave their full support to their
guest soloist who played zestfully,
and both cooperated with superb
results. Miss Goldstein generously
offered Mendelsohn’s “Capriccio” as
an encore number.

Another high spot on the pro-
gram was the University string en-
semble directed by Dr. Wendell
Otey, instructor in music apprecia-
tion, playing two suites for strings

and cembalo. This instrumental

E.’ G. Fremont, president of the

The industrial engineer, whose
organization”is credited with de-

rectly upon the “upper brackets of
management,” who, he said, have

_ been relying upon the “old Amer-

ican theory that we will get by
so_mehow.” . .
.“There has been lack of plan-

deliberation and a wild rushing

tory results would follow,’’ Fremont
said. ‘_‘The airplane industry has
.. suffered most from unbridled ex-

5,500 men they are turning out four

THE FUN HASS STARTED

“SLAPSY MAXIE”
ROSEN BLOOM

 

Direct from his Florida Tri-
umph with an All-Star Cast
of Hollywood Favorites, in-

music of the seventeenth century
has melodic appeal, freshness and
unusual charm.

.
Finney chose for his symphony
the familiar Beethoven symphony
No. 2 and the orchestra and con-
ductor gave this work all the
breadth and dignity it deserved.

Other items on the program were
Von Webers “Overture to Der
Freischutz,” and the “Overture to
Mi.gnon” by Thomas.

Conductor Flnney and the or-
chestra received spontaneous ap-
plause for the stirring account of
the Finale from the Dvorak Sym-
phony No. 5, bringing the concert
to an impelling close.

Each operator in San Francisco’s Chinatown telephone ex-
change must speak English plus at least three of the five
Chinese dialects—-Som Yup, Soy Yup, Hcong Sow, Cow
Gong and Aw Duck-—in order to handle calls. For the average
Chinese understands no dialect but his own!

Since there is no Chinese alphabet, the 36 page directory,
listing 22200 subscribers, can’t be printed in the usual way.

It is handwritten—then reproduced by engraving and print-
ing processes. Subscribers are listed by streets, instead of
alphabetically. And operators must almost know the book
by heart, for the Chinese seldom call by number—but by

name and address.

Here is a Bell System exchange that in many
ways is unique. But it is just like thousands of
others in giving good service to telephone users.

the Delts and Phi Kaps will tangle
in what should be an interesting
contest.

In this depart-

ment Phi Kappa’s ace Connell has

Silvcrman Carries SALE! Hopes
Also at 3 o’clock on field 2.

I.-a:n‘o:?_:.1 Chi Alpha will battle

‘Theta Clzi. Although both teams
are at equal strengtii, neither is

expected to .-nish out of the second
division.

Last years champion, the Sam-
mies. will start the defense of their
laurels against the  nine at 4
o’clock.

Missing from last year’s outﬁt
will be their star pitcher Lou
Mendlow, but his understudy,
“Red” Silverman, will be enough
to carry them safely past the
opener.

Another interesting game will be
played at the same time when a
star studded Phi Gam team plays
Sigma Chi.

This outﬁt, led by such outstand-
ing players as Bitner, Grossett, and
Colvin, should have no trouble
with the much weaker Sigma Chi
nine.

Rosenstock Captains Phi Eps

At 5 o’clock two pre-season fa-
vorites, the Phi Delts and Phi Eps,
tangle in a game which may have
much to do with the season’s ﬁnal
standing.

The Phi Eps are expected to take
this contest on the strength of their
veteran battery of Silverburg and
Bernheim, and the slugging ability
of Captain Rosenstock, but Cox,
Young, and company can easily
spring an upset.

The last battle of the day will be
the contest between an untested
PiKA nine and a graduation rid-
dled Pilam team.

Biggest loss of the Pilams was
their pitcher, Bert Jaﬁe, and they
will have to depend solely on their
remaining veterans, Kreimer, Mat-
tes, and Sable.

Pitt Swimmers
Prove Stronger

Than Expected

In picking the highlight of the
1940 Panther swimming season, the
surprising second place win in the
Eastern Collegiate Swimming As-
sociation meet, wins an unanimous
vote because it alone brightened
what might have been a very dis-
appointing campaign. '

The Panther splashers started
the season with an anticipated loss
to a superior Michigan aggregation.
Then the Gradymen proceeded to
drop some close ones to Franklin
and Marshall, Kenyon, Rider, and
Ohio State, with an easy victory
over Penn State sandwiched in.
Swimmers Faced Terriﬁc Schedule

A pair of problems that beset
Coach Ben Grady from the very
start of the season were his lack
of reserve strength and the dim-
culty of scheduling appropriate op-
ponentsg

It seems that the Pitt swimming ~ :1
in-b'e'— '

squad was a_ competitive
tween. They were quite capable of
keepinga clean slate against splash
teams of the {calibre of Tech or
Slippery Rock. 4 On. the other hand,
the Panthers weren"t strong enough
to cope ‘with the superior strengths

of such teams as Michigan, Ohio,
State, or other highly respected ‘

squads... But Pitt chose the latter
of the two evils and the poor rec-
ord was, the result.

As for the individual swimmers,
they deﬁnitely deserve a bit of ver-
bal applause for their efforts. Dick
Ames, captain of the squad, con-
sistently won the diving duels with
his outstanding performances.
Ames had a very capable assistant
in little Joe Kaule, who by his val-
uable contributions this year, be-
comes the ﬁrst student from the
Pharmacy School to win a varsity
letter in almost ten years.
COSg'rove High Point Man

Herb Cosgrove, Eastern Collegi-
ate breaststroke champion, is high
scorer of the Panther squad. His
accomplishments are well known
to followers of the acquatic sport at
the University. Joe Orloff gave
Cosgrove quite a battle for top hon-
ors of the aggregation. Swimming
both the free styles and backstroke,
Orloff in his junior year has deﬁn-
itely earned his letter.

Another consistent free-style Win-
ner was Gus Wilde, a Grady-made
merman." Before coming to Pitt,
Gus had never competed in a swim-
ming race. But under the tutelage
of Coach Grady, Wilde conditioned
himself by taking a one-mile swim
workout every day. His highly
successful season resulted.

5 Indoor Track Marks Broken
At Ninth Annual University Meet

Pitt’s ninth annual University

indoor championships came to an

end yesterday afternoon with a record breaking two mile run by Walt

Sterner.
varsity and freshman track stars.

Four records were smashed by

one by an unsung freshman miler.

It marked the ﬁfth mark broken in the three'day affair by

the Panther varsity squadmen, and
Leading the assault on the Pitt

trackhouse records were Del Anderson, brilliant senior half miler, Dusty
Rhodes, junior pole vaulting sensation, Hap Stickel, the junior low
hurdling star, Bill Curtis, freshman miler from Sewickley, and Sterner

in the two mile run.

It would be hard. to single out any one of these performers as more
outstanding than the others, but Anderson’s feat rubbed the biggest
name from the list when. the smooth striding senior broke the immortal

Johnny Woodruﬁ°’s half mile mark by :00.3.

Anderson toured the 880-

yard route in 1159.5, remarkable time for the number of harp turns he
has to take in the wooden shack back ofthe metallurgical laboratories.

Walter Sterner took the spotlight in the last day of the meet when

he broke the seven year old two
mile record by 203.7. He ran the
course in 9148.2 to establish a
mark that should not be touched
for quite some time-
Rhoades Breaks Record

As expected, Rhoades knocked
the old pole vault record into a

cocked hat, soaring to 13 feet 6 -

inches, nine inches above Cy Pelu-
cha’s old standard. His vaulting
twin, Red J essup, didn’t fare as well
as he usually does, missing at 13
feet. Rhoades attempted to goto

13 feet 9 inches but ﬂicked the bar ,
slightlyaonsthe way down. .
Stickel, who has been alternating
between the track and the football
field came back yesterday to :-break
by one-tenth‘ of

a second the low
hurdle record. he,
' shared with Ken
Ryden. He post-
_ ed marks of 5.9
- seconds for both
his trial" heat
and semi-ﬁnals.
Tuesday after-
noon, the hard-
enin g process
that develops in
muscles after
‘football activity
was evident as
he lost to Bullet
Bill Carter and
Stickel showed strain in
running a 33.9 second two—lap dash,
far slower than the record.
Curtis Sets New Freshman Mark

A long-standing freshman mark
was shattered by Curtis, whose
long ebony legs covered the mile
in 4:41.8 seconds. The old ﬁgures
of 4:43 belonged to Red Tost who
posted that time back in 1934.

Thesummaries for Tuesday and
Wednesday follow:

is the easiest way to ﬂit home to the

again when vacation time’s over.
The saving is plenty big——in both

Syria-Lebanon Room Differs
From Others in Project

. By GEORGE cnnucos

Distinctive from all other nation-
ality rooms, the Syria-Lebanon
room which will be opened some-
time in Mat; is an authentic orig-
inal, every part of which has been
imported from its former site in
Damascus, the capitol of Syria.

When the French had to destroy
several palaces in Damascus in or-
der to create a new modern road,
Asfar, a well-known near-East an-
tique dealer, bought and removed
the ﬁnest panelgd rooms of one of
these palaces for sale in the United
States, where original Syrian pan-
eling had been unknown.

Four complete rooms were
brought to the United States and
were displayed in 1937-1938 in the
Vester galleries in New York.

Albert Klimcheck, University
architect, obtained one of these au-
thentic chambers, a library, for the
Syrian—Lebanese of Pittsburgh
when they decided to build their
nationality room. Then contrary to
all the other rooms, instead of ﬁt-
ting the pieces to ﬁt the room, the
University carpenters built a new
room to ﬁt the pieces.

This room which is a small one
is situated on the side of the Cathe-
dral looking out towards Heinz
chapel and adjacent to the Univer-
sity post-office.

The walls are constructed of pine
on which designs are molded in
plaster, colorfully painted. This
type of decoration is called Gesso
work.

Around the top of the walls, on
separate panels, a Syrian quotation

Dean Tippetts Praises Jones 
In ¥Vo1-k on Public Relations

“The one professor in the Uni-
versity who has done the most to
improve public relations,” is the
honor ascribed to Montfort Jones,
professor of ﬁnance, by Charles S.
Tippetts, dean of the School of
Business Administration.

Pointing out the number of times
Mr. Jones has left his teaching post
to attend the panel discussions
sponsored by the American Bank-
ing association concerning the eco-
nomic and ﬁnancial effects of the
defense program and the war on
the United States, Dean Tippetts
said that these discussions created
such a goodwill everywhere they
were presented there was no doubt
as to who was spreading the great-
est amount of goodwill outside the
University.

The panels have been presented
in nearly every large city in the
east including New York, Philadel-
phia, Atlantic City, Cleveland,
Richmond, Louisville, and as far
west as St. Paul, Minneapolis, and
Milwaukee, and Jones has been
present at each one.

William A. Irwin, assistant direc-
tor of the graduate school of bank-
ing, directs the four man discussion
team. Willard Atkins, chairman of
the department of economics at
Washington Square college and A.
Anton Friedrich, director of the di-
vision of uniﬁed studies", at Wash-
ington Square college, both of New
York university, together with
Jones make up the complete team.

All of the participants in the
discussion are members of the eco-
nomics faculty of the graduate
school of banking.

Friday, Mr. Jones will leave
Pittsburgh to attend the spring
meeting of the faculty and alumni

Eugene Myers, instructor in eco-

To be used as a conference room

will have no chairs, but instead
will have low divans lining its
three sides. Each divan will be
covered by three large satin ﬁnish-

small low tables called “iskamalas”
will be placed before the divans.
