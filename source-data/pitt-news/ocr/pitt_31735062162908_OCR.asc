Gerald Moore, .
Accolnpanist,

To/ Speak Here

Accompanist [Gerald Moore will
present a solo 'lecture—recital en-
titled ‘The Accompanist Speaks”
at this Wednesday’s Midday pro-
gram ‘in the1SU ballroom. He will
later meet informally with stu-
-dents at the 3 p.m. coffee ho‘ur*in
the "Lounge. . ,
' A recent Moore performance re-
‘ceived this reaction from “The
Manchester Guardianz” “If any-
body ever has the opportunity to

* attend Gerald Moore’s lecture-re-

cital, ‘The Accompanist -Speaks,’
let him not miss it, even if a long
journey is involved on_ foot, with
peas in the boots.”

The _program Moore presents is
basedon his long experience in
accompanying .singers and in-
strumelltal virtuosos. Included
‘among them are Mesdames‘Flag-
stad, Gerhardt, and .'Hempel;
Chaliapin, Kipnis, Melchoir; and
violinists and‘ cellists such as
Casals, Elman, and Menuhin.

Born in Watford, England, in

1899, .most of Moore’s early

musical training was in Canada

able -English boy pianist.”- Later
he retulgled to ‘England, deter-
mined to become an accomplish- ~
ed musical. _

It is said that the turning point
in his life came when Landon
Ronald told’ him that the world
was over—stocked with’ brilliant

solo. pianists, but that there were.
few greed accompanists in -the

ﬁeld. _ _ _

,Moore toured the U.S. with

tenor John Coates in 1925., But

his own concer activities were
confined to Europe until his New

York Town Hall performance in-.

 Tuesday at Noon ~ -
_, I i ;The conﬂict between Tap Day and Engineers Week
A has been resolved. Tap Day ceremonies will go on as sched-
uled at noon on March 16. The engineers’ event originally
set for that time will be held instead on March 18 (Friday) ‘_
“on the hill.’’. .   I
There probably is-nothing wrong with this slight al-
eration in the engineers’ "plan except that they must make
“the necessary changes. But there was one item which came
, to light during the “negotiations” between the two groups
that could use changing itself. . —
 The engineers said they were considering having their
‘ ‘-special event on the Tuesday of that particular week. This
was not possible, however, because Tuesday at noon is re-
served for one event and onlyone-——services at Heinz'Chapel.
_ Restricting this hour to only these services seems pure-
ly illogical. We have no ﬁgures on the average attendance at
. the Chapel services, but common sense dictates that not
pl enough persons would attend to warrant making this hour
 fprohibitive to other university events./ ‘ p _‘ ‘
i After all, the services and the Chapel are geared to
.only one faith. ’ '. -V
No other continuing uniiférsity event is given such-

 
  
  
 
  

To

 
   
 
 
   
   
     
  

7';sa1_rie time as a Midday program. But a Midday program
I ‘could not be held at the same time as _Heinz'Chapel services
’:"-'—at noon on Tuesday. ~ .. ‘ J V - '
' ' Just what person or what oﬁice established -this policy
 is not too clear. The stock answer given to anyone who in-
-2
glversity policy.” ’  - h _
“ ' The Heinz Chapel services are ﬁne for those students
- 5. who want to participate in them. No reason exists, though,
 why students should not have the right to make a choice
I ;._of what program or event to attend at noon’ on Tuesday or
uanyother time, ‘ ’
Such a choice is taken away when the hour is closed
 j to everything except the services. If only the person. who
« set this policy could be found, maybe it could be clianged‘.

The Tubk Shop, with its vile coffee, catatonic
squatters, and depressing cliques,.tucks itself into
a corner of the cathedral convenient to students
and personnel. It’_s a uniqueiplace.

The,interior design of the Tuck Shop is not '-

functional as Scotty’s Diner, un- --
varied as the cafeteria, or topi-
cal as the HuntRoom. There are
no iron chairs, Vfprmicah tables,
drapes, signs, or pictures‘ (save
one painting) on "the walls to
deliberately create a mood. '
The ceilingand walls and the
ﬂoor are not painted with gay,
imposing colors, nor are they
made fancy "with the adornments
of some architectural period.
Everything in the Tuck Shop is

plain and simple. , ' ' -

The place -is neutral in tone. Whether a person
feels happy or blue, the place sympathizes_ with

that mood. In the argot of the logotherapists tht;
Tuck Shop is thus a psychological chameleon.
The Tuck Shop’s indirect .lighting gives it a
special tone. The light coming through the big
windows, anything but direct, brings out a soft-
nesspin. things:
Sbft. Warm. with Many Shapes .- ' 1
,\One the walls, lights camouﬂaged by cream-
colored shades send a warm light up to‘ the ceil-
ing. From behind each ceiling beam shines a light
that the-ceiling sends down tgthe Tuck Shop soft
and clean. -.» ' , _
/Even more unique, In this narrow age of con-
densing and compacting, the Tuck Shop is extra
spacious. Its high ceiling, its bread, smooth walls,
and its monstrously large windows give it a roomy
atmospliere. The wide aisle running the length of
the main area of the Tuck_Shop and spreading far

‘into each booth balance out'this spaciou/sness. _
Tuck Shop" booths are something special -in

themselves. These ‘heavy, padded, green benches

‘with’ high, thick backs have a distinctive shape.

Some look like ill-formed horse shoes, others like
watermelon rinds. Their great size forces people
to sit cramped close to one another, ‘yet strung
wide apart like_ an arc of strung beads.

books, purses, and scarfs interspersed with cof‘lee- .
stained cups, paper bags, half eaten sandwiches,—_
and bent straws. The creation on each table and its

‘spill—of’f onto the seats gives each booth at distinc-

tive character. — ,
It's All in One's Perception

The "curvature of.each of these centres of cul-
ture differs from that of adjoining ones. This dis-
tinctiveness is furthe\r enhanced by the way people
sit in the booths. As they sit in one booth facing
one another in a group, they have their backs
to those in adjoining booths. _

The Tuck Shop is a place of’ many views.
Shaped like the Greek letter pi, it contains several
pillars and ‘cigarette machines that obstruct any-
one’s view. It is impossible to see the whole place
at a ‘glance. . '

From one seat in a booth a person has .a cer-
tain view. But from another, two feet toeither.

has a different one. This is not_ because the curva-

ture of‘ the booth has turned him around either,

In this way, the Tuck Shop is a’ different place_ »

for each person, depending on where he usually sits.‘

the debit side of the ledger Ben Grady’s tanke1's'haye won only two
meets while dropping eight. Carl Rees’“‘thinclads have failed to win
in their ﬁrst threestarts but‘ should make -awespeetable showing in
the IC4A’s this week. . ' ,

Individual D8l'f0rnl6l'S/ in their respective sports have been
Dave Hirst, gymnastics, Jim Emert, swimming, Ralph Mason.
squash, Mel Barnwell, Larry =0ch, track, Dick Martin, Larry
Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington and John Zolikoff, wrestlers.

Dave Hirst, Panther top gymnast, broke the uniVersity’s record
for number of points scored in a career when he scored 16 points
against Temple to bring his total to 271..‘ But more outstanding was‘
his performance against Navy when the senior from Philadelphia
broke Tom Darling’s total of 232 points-for one performance on the
ﬂying rings. The gymnastic team will be traveling to Temple for the

-Easterns this week and; chances are that Hirst will be,_adding a-few=

-more laurels as he grows near the end of his college career.

In swimming it has been the record breaking races of Pan-
ther Jim Emert. While swimming the 50 and 100. yard freestyle,
Emert was defeated only oncepin both of theseraces. He set a new
Pitt record in the 50 andlhis only loss in thatdistance came
against NYU when Bill Lather set a school mark of 23.6_ seconds.
Emert, too, will b_e going to the-Easterns next _week and Grady is

. counting on him’ to make a good showing for the lowly swimmers.

Mel -Barnwell and Larry Och have been the big names in track
for Coach Rees Although Barnwell didn’t do well against Army in
the opening meet he has come backstrong and should be one of the
fastest men in the East this year. _/Och, a shot putter, broke Pitt’s
record in that event with a throw of 51 feet,,«7.1/2 inches. He broke the

eight minutes Guzik chased the

the Panthers would win the
meet. But at this point the ref

the meet ended in a 14-14 tie.
