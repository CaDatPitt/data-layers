  Details released and

Western Psychiatric
Institute shootings

By Gretchen Andersen ~
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Allegheny County District Attorney Ste-
phen Zappalajr. said Wednesday that many
people could have been hurt “beyond what
we experienced” during the Western Psy-
chiatric shootings on March 8.

But Zappala said that UPMC had sev-
eral warning signs before the shooting
occurred. The alleged shooter, 30-yeariold
John Shick, menaced UPMC Shadyside
employees with a baseball bat on two sepa-
rate occasions, but the incidents were not
reported to police. In February, a doctor
across the country, who had been in com-
munication with Shick, alerted UPMC"that
Shick could pose a threat to the hospital.

The district attorney read email cor-
respondences between the_Ca1ifornia doc-
tor and an assistant U.S. attorney during
Wednesday’s press conference at the Uni—_
versity of Pittsburgh Public Safety Build-
ing. He also discussed the events leading
up to and during the incident, as.well as
the response of Pitt police. This was the
ﬁrst time Zappala has spoken about the
shooting, which left Shick and a UPMC
employee dead and seven others wounded,
since the incident happened nearly three
weeks ago. ~ »

Police Chief Nathan Harperjoined Zappala, T

who outlined the events of the shooting, as
well as developments pertaining to Shick’s
mental health leading up to March 8.

The warning signs

Deputy District Attorney Mark Tran-
quilli said that in November 2011, Shick
had his ﬁrst interaction with Western Psy-
chiatric Institute after being banned from
Duquesne University, and was reluctant to
speak with mental health experts.

At the end of November, the doctor at ‘

Western Psychiatric Institute scheduled a
follow—up, which Shick attended. The doc-

tor had already made contact with Shick’s ‘

mother, who called in and reported her
son had been diagnosed with late—onset
schizophrenia, and was concerned he had
stopped taking his medicine for the past
eight to'10 months, Tranquilli said.

Pitt received bomb threats at both the Ca-
thedral of Learning and. Chevron Science

Center Wednesday. ' - '

This marks the fourth bomb threat a
the Cathedral over the past two weeks and
the second at Chevron since February.

‘ Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said that
the threat at Cathedral Wednesday is re-
lated to the previous three threats, while
the one at Chevron is not related. .

Around 10 a.m., Pitt sent out the ﬁrst

‘Emergency Notiﬁcation System alert of the

day, alerting the campus of the Chevron
bomb threat and telling people.to evacuate
the building. -  g
The -threat concluded nearly two hours
later, and police reopened the building at
1 p.m. -
' Pitt spokesman John Fedele saidthat
the threat was similar to others received
this month, and it was found in a women’s
bathroom.

bomb threat shortly after the evacuation
began at 5:49 pm. The threat concluded
a little before 8 p.m., and the building re-
opened at 9 p.m. . '

The doctor at Western Psychiatric Insti-
tute encouraged Shick to get on a prescrip-
tion for schizophrenia, but Shick refused and
terminated the appointment. Tranquilli said
the doctor reported that Shick had another
appointment scheduled for December, which
he did not attend.
Tranquilli said Shick’s interactions with
UPMC became “more disturbing” at the be-
ginning of this year.

“Cutting to the chase, I ﬁnd myself in a
very unusual predicament. Turns out I sus-

long before it was announced.-That’s be-
cause John Shick contacted me two Weeks,
before the shooting, and because I sounded
the alarm at UPMC about the risk this man
presented,” the email read. “I sit here now

Zappala said detectives will head out to
California to investigate the doctor’s email

“There are writings where he is angry,

Zappala referred to a map of Western
Psychiatric Institute and photos of the crime
scene to outline the events of that day.

“There’s evidence taken from his apart—.
ment- which indicate that he had a walking
map of UPMC facilities, but had also drawn
some maps, one.of which had a cafeteria

Urgent Care.

About a half—hour before entering UPMC_’s
Western Psychiatricllnstitute, Shick called
‘Yellow Cab and planned to take a taxi to the

hospital with two bags ﬁlled with Molotov _

cocktails, triage bandages and incendiary
materials. that would trigger an explosive,
Zappala said. '

Yellow Cab could not offer Shick a ride, so
he left the bags at his apartment and walked
to Western Psychiatric Institute on O’Hara
Street with two 9 niillimeter handguns.

According to Zappala, the shooting began
when Shick entered the building shortly

' after 1:42 p.m. wearing a trench coat and

’ carrying an umbrella and hat that concealed
his two weapons. - H
Shick ﬁrst shot UPMQ security guard]er—

UPMC

 

emy Byer in the leg and proceeded to ﬁre
at him twice more, but missed. Shick then
moved into the ﬁrst ﬂoor lobby where he
shot receptionist Kathryn Leight, 65, four

- times, and unit clerk Marta Drevitch, 56,‘

twice. .

Byer, Leight and Drevitch survived the
shooting, along with four other victims.
UPMC employee Michael Schaab, 25, died
after Shick shot him.

‘ Zappala believes Schaab was shot in the
lobby because the McDonald’s wrapper that
Schaab entered the building with was left
there. Zappala said that according to the
autopsy, Schaab was shot in the chest. The

I bullet penetrated Schaab’s pulmonary artery

and aorta, causing him to die between one
and three minutes after Shick shot him.
Pitt police received a 911 call, and within
one minute and 46 ‘seconds, they were on
the scene. Zappala regarded that as an “out-
standing” response-time. He said at one
point about 11 Pitt police ofﬁcers wereon
thescene. -. ' .. . . -
“Their actions are nothing short of hero-
ic,” Zappala said of the Pitt police ofﬁcers.
Zappala said Pitt police met Shick in—a
hallway where Schaab’s body was lying on
the ground. Shick took cover behind Keith

. Taylor, a UPMC employee, whom he had

shot in the ankle.

Pitt police ofﬁcer Tom Lasky asked Shick
to get on the ground several times. Shick
almost complied, putting his gun on the
ground and his hands up, but stayed in a
kneeling position, ‘Zappala said.

' . Zappala said that Lasky told him most.
of what Shick said was incomprehensible, P

but remembers him saying “shoot me, just

shoot me.” However, the evidence taken‘

from 'Shick’s apartment is not consistent
with suicide—by-cop. _ ’ V
Soon after his interaction with Lasky,

‘Zappala said Shick “came up quickly,” on _

his knees and began to ﬁre in the hallway.
When Shick stopped ﬁring, Pitt police Sgt.

Daniel Papale returned ﬁre, fatally shooting ’

Shick three times: center mass’, hip and in
the head. ’ ~

there because of thebomb threat.

Pitt freshman Kaitlyn Probasco was in
class when the alarm went off at the Chev-
ron Science Center and said she was on her

_ way into the Cathedral of Learning later
‘that day when students started ﬁling out.

Frustrated after having her chemistry
exam postponed until Friday, Probasco, a -
Psychology major on the pre—med track,
commented on the way professors have
adapted to the string of bomb threats over
the past few weeks.

“It’s like they’re making it part of their
daily routine,” she said. V

Some classes reconvened on the Cathe—,
dral lawn after evacuation, and others out-
side of the_William Pitt Union. ~ '

Freshman Emily Saxon, a rehabilitation
sciences major, stood next to Probasco
outside of the Cathedral’s front entrance
and’ shared in her frustration. ,

“I don’t know who’s going to want to
come here,” Saxon said about high school
seniors deciding on colleges for the fall.

Neither student found signiﬁcance in V
Wednesday’s bomb threats.

Saxon hypothesized that the threats
came from a student who did not study for

have “crazy theories” as to the source of
the threats, and that she hoped it wasn’t a

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Boy_ stirs a cuphof homemade soda water with a °
stick. Boy leaves _stick in the cup. Boy leaves cup
outside on a cold evening. Boy tries to pull the
stick out the next day, but ﬁnds the stick is stuck.
Boy has invented the Popsicle. ' '
lIt’s funny to think that such an obvious treat
was actually created by accident. It seems inevi-
table that someone would discover that a stick and
frozen soda water are a great combination. But.

' we’ll never know for sure.

This brings usto another random combination .
that future generations may someday see: as obvi-
ous: Chess Boxing. '

No, not chest boxing, which would simply V

combine chest-based maneuvers into the familiar _
sport, or chess boxes, which provide a surface for
chess games._I’m talking about Chess Boxing.

If you aren’t familiar with the sport, it’s only
been around since the early ’90s and has yet ‘to
enjoy any popularity outside its European home-
land (with the exception of Wu—Tang Clan music
videos). The activity is exactly what -it sounds like:

' a four-minute round of chess followedbya three-

minute boxing round, with each alternating until
somebody is knocked out, checkmated, declared
victor bythe judges or dismissed for exceeding the
-12-minute time window for making chess moves. '
The sport features a combination as novel. as

. ' the Popsicle, except its creation was purposeful.

In the Popsicle’s case, the result was a convenient
way to enjoy a frozen, sweet treat. For Chess Box-

lete to exercise both brain and brawn C-— and more
importantly, to quickly switch back and forth be-
tween them. .

Both also reﬂect the times in which they were

created. Created in 1905, the Popsicle in many

ways embodies the amazing new conveniences

' the world experienced at the turnof the century.

Through industrialization and the rise of the mid-
dle class, more people than ever had leisure time,
and the Popsicle helped ﬁll part of the void.

Similarly, Chess Boxing reﬂects. today’s fast-
paced, multitasking culture. This column was
written from several locations over the course of
a week, interspersed delicately between exercis-
ing, eating, sleeping and a — ahem —— St. Patrick’s
Day weekend. How better to harness the modern
energy in all of us than through a sport like Chess
Boxing?

It remains to be seen whether the activity will

_ ever be popular in the United States. ESPN’s Rick

Reilly Characterized it as “one of the world’s dumb-
est sports,” so it may just be too weird for our cul-
ture’s taste. But its mere existence demonstrates
how disparate things can be combined in novel
ways to capture the spirit of a time.

‘The value of unexpected combinations extends
beyond sports and food. In health care, the com-
bined and unexpected contributions of 'econ'o—
mists, engineers and doctors are helping to‘ drive
innovation in hospital administration,“according

to Dr. Mark Roberts, the chairman of the Depart— .

ment of Health Policy and Management at the
Graduate School of Public Health. During a pre-
sentation in early March, he noted that while the
combinations aren’t as coincidental as adding a
stick to frozen soda water, the integration of dis-
parate ﬁelds has produced some of the most inter-
esting ideas he’s encountered in his career. ‘
We shouldn’t be afraid of experimentation.

or intentional combination of different things that
creates value. ‘ ’ . _ .
To encourage this experimentation, there are

many changes, big and small, that our community‘

would be to end restrictions on the use of pub-

lic spaces. The prohibition of skateboarding on '

This is where a defense of liberal arts education

At the very least, Pitt students should create

My mom thinks I have a lot of
friends. Or at least one friend. Or
at least one friend who likes me a
lot and texts me all the time.‘ But
really, it’s just Twitter, which my
mom happens to think is the stu-
pidest invention of all time. A ,
Now, I promise that. I have

other friends besides Twitter, -but -~

let’s face it: The social media ser-
vice gets a bad rap. Since it was
founded in 2006, it has attracted
a variety of criticisms, not all
of them invalid. Nevertheless, a
careful evaluation of its advantag-
es and disadvantages might help
change a lot of people’s minds.‘ V

..-Many Internet users’, “espe-

cially busy college students, are

wary of tweeting because it actu-

4 ally takes a lotof time.'Though_

the.‘ service advertises itself as
fast and easy, condensing your
thoughts to 140 characters might
prove difﬁcult.

' /

Keeping up with the people

you follow, as well, is time con- _

suming, especially because you
have to scroll through an end-
less page of tweets with no easy
way to search for the one you
want. Some Twitter_users might

be coming to terms with the fact A

that they just don’t have’ the time
to devote to the site.

Many people also ﬁnd it easi-
est ‘to maintain just one social
networking proﬁle. In most cases,
Twitter takes a back seat to Face-
book, which offers many features
that Twitter does not, including

: photo albums, a chance to identify

your likes and interests on ' an in-
formational page and the ability to
partake in groups and separate the

‘feeds of your friends. And although

pictures can be tweeted, they can-

not be displayed in the mass for-

mat familiar to Facebook users.
Another thing that discourag-
es users from embracing Twitter
is its seeming purposelessness.
If Ihad a nickel for every time
my mom asked me, “-But what

off my student loans next week.

While the purposes of Facebook

are as diverse as keeping up with
high school friends to advertising
the band you started last week-
end, Twitter seems like a venue
for spouting random thoughts in
bite—sized snippets.

Although it’s possible to follow
the thoughts of your old friends
and Tweet about your band, the
chances that these messages will

get lost in a feed is much more 7

likely than on a Facebook page,
where updates are separated into
categories. _ . _

For the above reasons, and

many "more I’m sure, Twitter has’

received a variety of harsh criti-
cisms, especially over the past
few months. At the same time, I
think more people will soon rec-
ognize its advantages.

Consider, for instance, that
Twitter users can take advantage
of free or’ discounted products,-
shows or appearances. Recently
Ingrid ‘Michaelson ' used only

Twitter and Facebook to_ an-

nounce her upcoming tour and‘

included a password for obtain-
ing. pre-order tickets. Other mu-
sical artists and celebrities have
also announced free shows and
surprise appearances via Twitter.

The service is also surprisingly

useful for personal relationships.-V

It’s much less invasive to follow
people on Twitter than'to' ask
for their phone number or even

friend them on Facebook._It’s a‘

friendly gesture that could be
helpful in the future if you need
to contact someone that you have

. no other way'of contacting. At the
beginning of the semester I fol-
.lowed a girl in one of my classes

on Twitter and was able to tweet
at her when I didn’-tunderstand
our homework assignment. Now
we’ve exchanged numbers and
are better friends because of it.
But perhaps-the best and most

like WPXI, the Pittsburgh Post-

A 9—by-12-foot wall stands in the back lot
of the Unsmoke Systems Artspace, an im-

posing art installation that is meant to be

just that. Projectors paint videos of Pales-
tinians onto the wall, their voices an eerie
mix of passion and sorrow, reﬂecting the
nature of the exhibition. ' .

Titled “I Am Palestine,” this installation
piece, imagined and constructed by Pitt se-
niors Karina Goulordova and Sean Neely,
gives a fresh view on Palestinians caught in
an area torn by war and violence. '

“The main purpose of this piece is" to
show the dominance of the wall,” Goulor-
dova said. “We hope that people, through
this exhibit, will be able to see another side
of Palestine.” , .

Goulordova ﬁrst went to the Palestin-
ian Territories two years ago as part of a
journey to practice and better her Arabic.

.Working with a local non-governmental

organization, Goulordova said she was
surprised by the level of diversity that she
encountered. Intrigued, she began to con-

‘MadMen’ premieregslow-paced. and character-driven s    

By Brian Dollard
Staﬂ‘ Writer

After nearly becoming as distant a mem-
ory as the 1960s, “Mad Men” returned to
.viewers on Sunday with the two-hour pre-
miere of its ﬁfth season. ‘

Few are happy with the status quo at
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce when the ac-
tion opens after Memorial Day .1966. The
symbolic drives the conﬂict in the ﬁrst epi-
sode. Megan (Jessica Paré) wants to throw
Don (Jon Hamm') a surprise birthday party.
Joan (Christina Hendricks) wants to leave
her apartment. Pete (Vincent Kartheiser)
wants Roger’s (John Slattery) more spa-
cious office.

- Although far from an exciting two

hours of television — the episode verged

on tedious —— the season opener’s reliance
on minor conﬂicts does not mean charac-
ter developments are absent from the pre-
miere. . -

While episode writer and series creator
Matthew Weiner takes a leisurely-pace to
develop the motivations behind these de-
cisions, each story gives the audience a
strong preview of what the new season
might examine. -

A key aspect of the ﬁrst episode that
“Mad' Men” examines well is the chang-

Megan arranges a surprise celebration
of Don’s 40th birthday with his coworkers

The swinging soirée serves as a
noticeable reminder of the genera- J T

Their disagreements over the

uses her sexual power over Don
in a way that his ex-wife, Betty,
never did. He is submissive to
her. Megan subtly sells faith-

prone Don.

Get ready to ‘Express Yourself’
  ~ with this summer’s hot song

MIERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS

  ratiuwuhsfiuln   f 

a

By Gabriela DiDonna
WPTS Contributor

With the weather growing warmer and
porchparties becoming more frequent,
one song has reigned supreme on my play-

. list designed to show the house across the
‘street who’s boss. Ladies and gentlemen,

the ‘undeniable summer song thus‘ far:
Diplo’s “Express Yourself,” featuring New
Orleans rapper Nicky Da B.

The ﬁrst single off Diplo’s forthcoming

EP of the same name, “Express Yourself” -

marks new territory for the Philadelphia-
based DJ, producer and owner of the record ,
label Mad Decent. Diplo, aka Thomas Wes-
ley Pentz, is best known for his production
work, ranging from clients such as Usher
(“Climax”), Santigold and M.I.A. His work -
spans genres as diverse as Brazilian baile
funk to moombahton to‘Angolan kuduro.
Yet it was Diplo’s appropriation of New ,0r-
leans bounce music on “Express Yourself”
that.marked the ﬁrst time I really took no-
tice of his beat—making skill.

“Express Yourself” takes its cue from

_New Orleans bounce, an energetic form

of rap music characterized by. a quick or
double—time bounce beat ripe for dancing.
What makes this particular form of music
so special is its ability to transcend differ-
ences between people and allow them to‘
do exactly what the title commands and
express th'err_1selves. It’s the perfect way to
get into the freedom of summer.’ . '

The track features hometown hero
Nicky Da B spitting quick rhymes and
commanding the listener to “make it clap”
in a way that adds another texture to_ the
already complicated beat. The video for
this song is equally thrilling, with men and
women shaking it to the beat while doing
handstands. . V

Diplo takes note of New Orleans bounce . ‘

at atime of renewed interest in the 30—yea_r- _
old genre, thanks to a new generation of

.. «qt.

HMCT Campus

musicians such as Big Freedia,. Rusty Lazer,
Sissy Nobby and Nicky Da B. Big Freedia
—— pronounced “Free—duh” —- the most
famous of the new crop, is a transgender
musician and the self-proclaimed “Queen
Diva” of Bounce music.

She’s brought her electric live show
twice already to the ’Burgh and returns

. in April to the Rex Theater. Her last» con-

cert, a packed house at the Shadow Lounge
in June, was a blur of call—and—response
action, sweaty dancing and “azz every-

where,” thanks to the audience and Freed-

ia’s backup dancers. ’ q .

The strength of bounce music, par-
ticularly the “sissy bounce” variant prac-
ticed by Freedia, is its ability to transgress
boundaries of sexuality, gender, and race.
It provokes both men and women to dance
its classic, hypersexualized-bounce style
with a lack of self-consciousness’ or inhi-
bition. If you want to strike up a rager this
summer, bump your stereo and express
yourself. a '

Aﬂﬁﬂjm REVEEW

Current events inspire Anti-Fp|ag’s new album

By Patrick Wagner .
Staﬁwriter

With the Occupy movement, WikiLeaks
and U.S. troops still on foreign soil, 2012
was made for an Anti-Flag album.

On The General Strike, Pittsburgh’s po-
litical punk band doesn’t just deliver new
slogans in the same musical template, but
rather explores the sonic versatility of
both punk and folk’ with an eye toward the
stories they tell. '

The ﬁrst track, “Controlled Opposi-
tion,” jets forward with screeching guitars,
tantalizing drum rolls and lead singer Jus-
tin Sane’s signature snarl —— all in less than
30 seconds. " '

“1915” rocks .;with articulate lead gui-
tar from Chris Head and a hypnotically
in-sync rhythm provided by drummer Pat
Thetic. Thematically, it focuses on the con-
troversial execution of songwriter and la-
bor activistjoe Hill. “Every word he wrote,
he spoke, he sung,” the group sings in uni-
son, “We are still singing.”

Chris #2’s heavy bass lines still frame
tracks like “The New Sound,”- and while the
group maintains their punk rock sound,
they’ve also moved toward a articulately
sung —- and heavily related — style of folk-
rock. “That alarm clock ringin’ in your ear /
Radio playing sports report cheer / But you
got nothing to cheer or shout about / Just a
nine-to-ﬁve'in a lousy town.”

“Resist” begins with a 30-second assault

of wailing guitars and screamed vocals be-
fore slowing itself down to about midtem-
po, then speeding back up again in ‘about
one minute. They never lost the punk rock.
The last track, “The Ghosts of Alexan-
dria,” shines with some of Anti-Flag’s most
beautiful songwriting to date. A melan-
choly bass and contemplative lead guitar
will scorch yourlears while the song’s re-

frain echoes, “And we watched the summer ‘

turn to the Autumn of Glory.”

While not ‘as consistent or ground-
breaking as The Terror State‘ or For Blood
and Empire, The General Strike is a strong

domination and oppression that this mas-

Since Neely had experience in wood-

much of the physical design‘ process and
construction. -

“My challenge wasdesoribing my vision _

Goulordova and Neely went on to ex-
plain that Braddock wasa thriving com-
munity during the steel boom, but since

, the mills began to outsource, the commu-

nity had ‘fallen on tough times, with shop
owners leaving in droves. ‘

 R'ecently.it’s been on an upturn, attract-

Contemporary art Ph.D candidate Cris-

or it can imply a group of producers or the

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers pickup win, force g

By R] Sepich
Staff’ Writer

~ Even without injured senior star

guard Ashton Gibbs, the Pitt
men’s basketball team refused to
let its season end‘ on Wednesday
night.

‘ With, a‘ dramatic 57-53 victory
over Washington State at the
Petersen Events Center, the
Panthers leveled the three—game
College Basketball Invitational
championship series with the
Cougars at 1-1. The decisive third
game will be played Friday night
at the Petersen Events Center.

Pitt sophomore guard Lamar
Patterson said Gibbs’ absence

didn’t affect the Panthers’
‘mindset too much throughout
the game.

“Our game plan didn’t really
change that much,” Patterson said
in a postgame presslcgonference.
“We knew what we wanted to do
coming into the game and I felt
like we did pretty much tha .”

Following Monday night’s
tough one—point defeat’ at
Washington State and the cross-
country ﬂight back to Pittsburgh,
the Panthers appeared to be

the fresher team early on in the .

game-

A pair of 3—point,ers from
junior point guard Travon
Woodall gave Pitt a 9-7 lead that
the team would maintain until
the game’s closing minutes.

Then, with time ticking down
in the ﬁrst half and the Cougars
hoping to carry momentum into

“the break, senior Nasir Robinson ’

found himself in a precarious
situation. The Pitt forward was
forced to hoist up a rare 3—pointer
and, to the pleasant surprise of
the crowd, swished the shot as
the Panthers went into halftime
with a 29-20 advantage.

“I just shot it and it went in,”
Robinson said of the shot. “I was
conﬁdent that it was going in.”

The 3—pointer was only the
seventh in Robinso_n’s career,

who scored 10 points and had 

four rebounds on Wednesday
’ evening.
However, the Cougars quickly
got’ back into: the game at the
beginning of the second half.’

“That’s something positive we

the Panthers’ lead for good when

After an important defensive
stop, sophomore forward Talib

A GYMNASTICS

By Dexter Gulick
Staﬁ’ Writer

This past Saturday marked the ﬁrst time in
eight years thatthe University of Pittsburgh
hosted the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics

-_,,League ‘a championship meet, and the

change of venue marked an improvement i

in performance for the Panthers.

The locationof the championship meet,

° has cycled through Pitt and the other seven

schools in the EAGL conference over the '

a

years. Pitt’s gymnastics team placed ﬁfth
this year, an improvement from last year’s
seventh—place ﬁnish.-
. This meet caps the season for the
Pitt women, giving the team a 9-11 (6-6
EAGL) record. Their record marks another

improvement from- Pitt’s 4-17 (1-7 EAGL)_

showing last year. ' -
“We had one of our best meets of the

year,” head coachDebra Yohman said.‘
"‘Our expectations were that we could

compete for the championshiptitle. That
meet was very close. There wasn’t a team

/ -

o

in that whole meet, out of eight teams, that
counted a fall. That’s pretty impressive. It
was very competitive.” . 1‘

As a team, Pitt ﬁnished third in the
unevenbars and second on the balance
beam with 48.755 and 48.725, respectively.
That placed the team just behind the West
Virginia Mountaineers’ 49.175 and North
Carolina State Wolfpack’s 49.100 (uneven
bars).and the West Virginia Mountaineers’
48.850 (balancebeam). W

Yohman. “I think the judges kind of boxed '

themselves in and got a little tighter for
the last two teams. I personally did not feel
like we got the scores we deserved on ﬂoor

compared to the other teams‘, but that’s -

not anything we can do anything about.”

' Pitt’s total score of. 195.375 was a mere
.125 points from the University of North
_Carolina’s 195.550, which earned them a
fourth-place ﬁnish. Overall, the Panthers

Nﬂlteamshattle
in final weeks for
i  playoff spots

By Donnie Tasser'
Columnist

With only ﬁve or six games remaining for
each team, the National Hockey League
playoff picture is still far from clear. "

l Three teams in each conference are
sitting comfortably with‘ playoff berths
locked up, but many more are scratching
and clawing for their opportunity to
«compete for Lord Stanley’s Cup. ’ ‘

In the East Division, three teams
from the Atlantic Division — the New
York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins and
Philadelphia Flyers '— have clinched
playoff spots, with a fourth — the New
Jersey Devils — sitting in sixth on the cusp
of securing their own spot. The drama lies
in the three—way battle for the last two
spots and the ﬁght for the top seed.

The Ottawa Senators (88 points),
Buffalo Sabres (86 points) and Washington
Capitals (84 points) are locked in a battle
with five games remaining for eachteam.

The Sabres are coming off a big 5-1
dismantling of the (Capitals and have won
ﬁve games in a row. They are surging at
the right time, but face a tough test in the

8 equally red-hot Penguins on Friday. .

stop underachieving in the playoffs? Well,
all signs point to a spring spent sitting on
the couch for the fading Capitals. They-
have lost ﬁve of their past seven games and
still have to play Boston, Florida and the

' Rangers. On top of that, they’ll needlosses
from either the Senators or Sabres. It’s
not looking good right now in our nation’s
capital, and I just can’t see them snapping
out of it in time to catch a spot.

The Penguins, currently on a 14-2-1 tear,
have been snapping at the heels of the top-
seeded Rangers for about a week. '

They are three points back with six
games to play, and every win is going to
count; If they fail to catch the Rangers, they
will be forced into fourth place —— behind
the three division winners —— and matched
up with the ﬁfth—seeded Philadelphia
Flyers in the ﬁrst round. Neither the Pens"
nor the Rangers desire a ﬁrst-round match:

tricky. There are ﬁve — count ’em, ﬁve -7
teams within two points of theﬁnal two
playoff spots in the conference.

Dallas and Phoenix (87 points) are
currently. in, but making their lives
miserable are Los Angeles, Colorado (both
with 86 points) and Calgary (85 points).
The Stars are sitting in the best spot,
currently in seventh (via tiebreaker over
the Coyotes) with six games remaining. The

Coyotes only have ﬁve games to play, but

get to play the likes of Anaheim, Minnesota
and Columbus — all pitiful teams.
Colorado is in a bit of a precarious
position, a point out but with only four
games to play, including a big match-up
with Calgary. The Flames have ﬁve games

remaining and also have to play the Kings, 

along with the Aves. . V

Los Angeles, following its game with
the Flames, only has to play the Oilers‘
twice and the Wild once in its remaining
games. But none of these teams are playing
particularly well. Dallas has won just two
of its past six games, Phoenix and Los
Angeles have both lost their past two, and
Colorado its past three. The Flames just
recently‘ defeated the Stars, but lost ﬁve in
a row prior to that. Whew, get all that?

Anyway, ifl had to bet, Ipwould say the ‘

Dallas Stars and the Los Angeles Kings both
limp into the playoffs in the most exciting

‘who—wants—it—least race that anyone has

ever seen. I

championship. ‘

“Going into the meet, we had high
expectations to do well,” Pitt senior Alicia
Talucci said. “I did everythingl really could
to contribute to the team. We didn’t count
a fall. We did everything we could, but
unfortunately it was left up to judging. As
a team we did everything that the coaches
asked of us. It just didn’t pan out for us in
the end.” .

Looking forward, the Panthers now
prepare for the NCAA regional meet held
in Raleigh, N.C. ' ' ~

Selection for the meet is tricky. Based '

on team’s overall scoring average, the top
36 teams are divided into six regions. After
the regions are established, the top ﬁve all-
around competitors ‘from each region are
selected from teams that were not invited
to attend the regional meet. Lastly, the

‘ top—ranked competitors in each individual

event are selected to compete.

Pitt’s team, averaging 193.445 points
per meet, did not meet the criteria to attend
the NCAA regional met in Raleigh. That
honor goes to Florida, Ohio State, Penn
State, North Carolina State, Kent State and
the.University of North Carolina. Instead,
Talucci and sophomore , Katie O’Rourke

deﬁcit back to just two. ‘

But Patterson ended all doubts by
draining two pressure free throws in
the game’s ﬁnal seconds to complete the
scoring. 6

After the game, Pitt head coach Jamie
Dixon said he was pleased with the victory
and believes playing in these close games
is something that will pay off when Pitt’s
returning players ﬁnd themselves in tight
battles in future seasons. '

“We’re getting. some good experience
out of this and working on these situations
will help us down the road,” he said.

_ Patterson agreed and said winning
games that come down to the wire will give
the Panthers conﬁdence heading into next
season. i "

“Some of our guys  weren’t as conﬁdent
during the season, but they’re getting that
conﬁdence right now and that’s going to

be erfect oin into next ear,” he said. ,
P S S Y

“We plan on getting back [to the NCAA
Tournament] next year.” _

Now' the two teams will meet one ﬁnal
time on Friday, with the victor ending their
season as CB1 champion. _

“It’s a good opportunity for us,”
Robinson said. “We wanted to play in this
tournament and now we want to try and get
this win Friday night.” I

will attend as individual specialists. Talucci
will compete in the vault and O’Rourke will
compete‘ in the ﬂoor "exercise only. Haley
Bodenheimer, named as the EAGL’s Rookie
of the Year, will attend as one of the ﬁve all-
around competitors.

Preparation-wise, ‘we’ll be doing the
same thing we’ve been doing, except that
we get two weeks to prepare instead of just
one,’f O’Rourke said. “I think it’ll be fun.
Florida, who’s ranked No. 1 in the country,

will be there, so that’ll be really fun to ‘

watch them.”

Pitt’s NCAA regional meet will be hosted
by North Carolina State, an EAGL foe.
Action starts Saturday, April 7 at 4 p.m. at
the Reynolds Coliseum. I i
