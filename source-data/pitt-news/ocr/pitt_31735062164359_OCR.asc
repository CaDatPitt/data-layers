Macapagal pak at Convocation  

Philippine President

Depicts Asia as the
Ideological Battlefield

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld departed from the pro-
cedure of past years of delivering a state of the union speech
about the University at the Fall Convocation to allow Dios-
dado Macapagal, president of the Philippine Islands, to de-
liberate about the state of the world.

After honorary degrees were conferred upon Sister M.
Thomas Acquinas Carroll, Robert Brainard Corey, and Solis
Horwitz, alumni who have distinguished themselves in their
respective ﬁelds, President Macapagal was presented with
an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree and proceeded to
deliver the main Convocation address.

President Macapagal’s main theme was the Asian social revolu-
tion. He emphasized, “Asia must change its economic level or perish.”
A new synthesis is required to meet the current problems he said.
He deﬁned these problems as food, freedom, and government.

Economy Grows

He noted that although there has been an accelerated economic
growth, a great deal of progress has yet to be made to provide the
ordinary man with a decent standard of living. “Asians must in-
crease their national self—determintion to combat the obstacles fac-
ing them. The establishment of a government that demands popular
control is a mandatory step.”

Macapagal said there are two opposing solutions to Asia’s
problems: one by the Communist and another by the democratic
world. “Some Asians see in Communism their only hope for
salvation. Burdens of depression for years have inﬂuenced their
belief that the Soviet Union and Communist China provide the
best answers to their problems.”

The Russian revolution of 1917 said Macapagal, set Asians off
to march for freedom. As the Communists gained power, he explain-
ed, they propagandized Asian communism as the first step toward
democracy. The leaders were portrayed as agrarian reformers, not
communists.

America Counters

Said Macapagal, “These lies drew vigorous responses from Amer-
ica, who countered them with statements to the effect that Com-
munism must be suppressed, even with troops, if necessary.”

President Macapagal emphasized that the United States can-
not afford to be neutral. “One-half of the world's population
lives in Asia, with one-third located in the Far East. Intercession
is compulsory to show the marked difference between the so-
cial revolution in Asia -and Communism. The social revolution
cannot be contained; communism can and must be suppressed.”

President Macapagal closed his address by saying that the forma-
tion of .a solution to Asia’s problem requires cooperation between
Asia and the West. He declared that the West must realize that this
is Asia’s problem and Asia’s choice. “It must be reckoned with as
an ally or an enemy in its own right.’-’ ‘

MDC Starts Night Vi gils to Ward Off Raids

By CHRIS MARTIN

At a two hour meeting Wednesday, Men's Dorm Coun-
cil passed a resolution for a pre-exam period and nominated
a candidate for homecoming queen. An all night vigil to
guard against West Virginia University raiders this week-
end, was also authorized.

The Dorm Council passed a unanimous resolution call-
ing for reading periods before ﬁnals. The resolution will now
be forwarded to the Student Affairs Committee. Currently,
ﬁnal exams begin the day after classes end.

Alice Bilewicz was nominated to represent MDC in the
Homecoming queen contest. Tickets for Homecoming will be sold
for $5.50. They could be sold for ﬁve dollars if two thirds of the
non-Greek dorm members want tickets. James Neubeck, MDC vice-
president, reminded dorm senators that their houses’ enthusiasm at
the pep rallies counts points toward the spirit trophy.

Elections
In the election of secretary and treasurer for the President’s Cabi-
net, MDC President Harvey Lefton admonished the delegates not
to lower the requirements for the two offices for they would “moral-
ly violate the constitution of MDC,” which he described as a “sacred
documeu .” An amendment passed at the meeting set requirements

as a minimum of 45 credits and a QPA of 2-75. A P1‘0P0Sed amend.-i “

ment for lowering -the requirements failed. In the election, Harold
Blumberg was elected secretary and Stephen Glassburg, treasurer.
Ed J-alil, athletic chairman, reported a new system has be
devised for rating teams and that bowling may also be offered.
He said it is still doubtful whether the softball dorm champs
will play the fraternity winners. Publicity chairman Warren
Cox announced that MDC will buy a large roll of paper to be
sold at a slight proﬁt to houses for posters, making money for
MDC. Banners cost for Homecoming this year will be limited
to $20.
Resolutions were passed calling for an open house this weekend
and house participation in the United Fund. MDC hopes to have

‘ each member contribute ten cents to the Fund.

The Vigilantes

The most spirited order of business was the resolution dealing
with prevention of damage by West Virginia raiders this weekend.
John Bender, assistant director of men’s housing and adviser to MDC,
urged the passing of the resolution. He said if it was well organized,
it would be fun. Following discussions as to how and what would
be the duties of the vigilantes, a vote was taken on the issue.

Is was unanimous except for Warren Coax who said, “This sort
of thing could lead to a reoccurance of what happened last Tues-

day. I don’t think the men will be -very silent, especially at those‘

‘hours of thetmcrning-."~ =‘ 1 ‘ 1

According to Dr. Anthony, the importance of
linguistics is that it “gives insight into certain
aspects of human behavior, namely, how human
beings communicate with each other.” Due to the
advancement in linguistics, missionaries and edu-
cators are able to assist in the development of
.alphabets for unwritten languages.

To Choose 36 Delegates

For the ﬁrst time in the history
of the University, the freshmen
men will have a Freshmen Coun-
cil. Organized by Men's Council
which is headed by Lenny
Schwartz, the freshman group
will be comprised of 36 men.

Delegates will be selected on
the basis of a proportion of com-

may be obtained in the Dean of

For those people who have difficulty
speaking a foreign language, the study of
linguistics provides an effective technique
for mastering other tongues.

Dr. Edward M. Anthony, chairman of
the University’s new Department of General Lin-
guistics, stresses that by making a detailed analysis
of the structure of different languages, it is possi-
ble to erase habits developed from one’s native

purpose of teaching linguistics abroad. The United
States Information Agency has binational centers
located in many areas of the world at which Eng-
lish is taught. These centers are represented by
members of two nationalities.

Dr. Anthony stated that the University was
interested in establishing a linguistics depart-
ment because it is more and more becoming a
university responsibility to aid in the under-
standing of human linguistic behavior.

Before the linguistics department was founded
at the University, Dr. Anthony worked extensive-
ly on sever.al phases of linguistics. He taught lin-
guistics at the University of Michigan for 19 years.

In 1951, he set ‘up an accelerated English pro-
gram in Afghanistan. Dr. Anthony taught in Thai-
land during 1955-57 on a Fulbright lecture grant
and returned there from 1958-61 as director of a
three-country linguistics program in Thailand,
Laos, .and Vietnam.

The subject of academic dishonesty is always a good one to toss around on a
philosophical plane and is a typical one to be entertained in discussion by honorary ‘

 . fraternities or so-called policy-making groups.

It is a good one to toss around because people can tch-tch and relieve any sub-
conscious tension they might have about its actual exi'stence. But doing anything about
it is'quite another thing: it exists at most schools, the discussion goes; it is part of
human nature; and you can’t make the world perfect, you know.

This summer the Student Affairs Committee had an interesting chat with Pro-
fessor George Fahey who was concerned with the problem and had been working
wi'thin the University Senate to draw up a statement of policy from the faculty’s
viewpoint. ‘

The Committee tossed around the idea, as committees do, and generally concur-
red that although the students certainly could not be held blameless in the cheating
that it was idea1istica.lly up to the individu al professors to set an atmosphere of aca-
demic integrity in their classrooms. Stud ents cited instances of large lecture courses
which, with little supervision and multiple choice examinations, were most conducive
to cheating. - ‘ V

They also described classroom situations where a professor had m-ade his views
on integrity so clear that he could walk out of a three hour test and not one student
would think of cheating. The test was also constructed in such a comprehensive way
that cheating would be almost impossible.

_ Professor Fahey said at that time that he would take the Committee’s recom-
mendations back to the University Senate and that they, as the appropriate source,
would draw up a statement by this fall. Hopefully then, the students would give
an all-out support for the first strong stand the University has taken in this area.

In prepration for Professor Fahey’s report, Student Government has already
designated a committee to draw up spine written support for the more detailed stand
to be taken by the faculty. We also under stand that the Student Union Board is dis-

‘ , cussing a forum program to air administrative, faculty, and student views on the prob-

lem. No amoiint of discussion can be too much if it ends with a concrete statement

   

of policy. This is one line of student development that must be explicit.

Editor, "The Pitt News:

In the Friday, October 2, edi-
tion of The Pitt News, an article
by Miss Nancy Delaney appeared
on page four. The article was an
an extremely eloquent plea for
a more non-conformist student
body, one which is not afraid to
register its complaints in such a
way as to be unmistakably clear
to the administration’. All well
and good.

Buried inside the column, how-
ever, was a cleverly conceived
dig at Senator Goldwater. Miss
Delaney associates anti-discrimin-
ation, anti-aloofness, and non-

Fortunately, there are some
students here who do not reflect
the atmosphere created in Miss
De1aney’s article.

Miss Delaney would call us ex-
tremists; she would chastize us
for wanting to act drastically to_
stave off the increasing loss of
our freedom. Yet with inﬁnite
hypocrisy she encourages stu-
dents to “throw red slips and
chant ‘We shall overcome,’ re-
fuse to pull down the shades,
and demand ‘We want silk”’ as a
manifestation of their disapproval
of the status quo.

In short, Miss Delaney is ad-
vocating extremism, pure and
simple, and it doesn’t look quite
so bad on the other foot, does it?

Spiraling Spirit . .-

Show — Offs Subdued

By AL JANEZIC

The Spirit Award Committee of Student Government ‘.7

has wasted no time in subduing show-offs vying for the Spir-
it Award. The judges have pared points from ratings of
groups caught acting in “poor taste,’f especially at last Sat-
urday’s football game where objects were thrown on the
playing ﬁeld, and students were nab-
bed interfering with half-time cere-
monies of both schools.

“Poor taste,” however, is rather
mild; rude would be more accurate

ample, after the majority of the SA
participants bobbed their signs and
I strained their lungs" “in taste,” an
Indian whooped along on horseback
during the William and Mary alma
mater. '

siasts thought the spirit was liquid, got groggy and passed?
out.

Misdirected spirit was evident, too, at the pep rally on
Friday. One group of crowd pleasers decided to make a
commotion with a motor scooter to drown out the band.

-Others huddled to talk when cheers were in progress and

then stood mute, waiting for a break in the cheering to
get in their own choruses. Even the cheerleaders didn’t
help much as they tittered at a chant offered by the band.

program that has begun on a strong note. Nary a violation
was noted at the Fall Convocation, where orderliness, ap-
pearance and especially attendance were more important
than outbursts of glee.

_' ALONG WITH a $2 deposit that entitles a group to
complete for the award has gone a genuine feeling to win.
The appearance of numerous banners and signs at the rail
lies and thefootball game have shown that the organiza—_
tions are not taking the competition ﬂippantly.

And neither are the 18 judges. They have cited their
disappointment at the lack of common-sense politeness.
They-.a.pparently are out to notice the little diffe-rences that

measure spirit.

IFC otes to Have

Homecoming Floats

If Frats Say Yes

Interfraten. .y Council has voted to build Homecoming
ﬂoats, provided that at least seven fraternities commit them-

selves by next Friday.

The decision reached at Wednesday’s meeting, was a
combination of two resolutions. First, IFC approved by a
narrow margin the ﬂoat proposal submitted by the 1964
Homecoming Committee. The stipulation was made that the
proposal be “subject to change by the committee.”

Then, to insure sufficient support from the Greeks, IFC
resolved to drop the construction of ﬂoats if less than seven
fraternities register by October 16. The registration date was moved
a week ahead by Jim Smith, Homecoming chairman, to iron out dif-

ﬁculties' with the proposal.

The proposal calls for the construction of ﬂoats on 14 feet long,
ﬂat-bed stake trucks with. a $100 limit. Up to ﬁve live ﬁgures may be

placed on the ﬂoat. The cost, size,

and hours spent on the ﬂoat were In other
cut in half this year because IFC
vetoed ﬂoats last year unless
satisfactory solutions to the prob-
lems of money, time, size, and

irate neighbors could be found.

business, Richard

Bruni of Phi Kappa Theta was
elected secretary of IFC, and
Jack Koury announced that open
rush ends Tuesday at 5 p.m.

IFC Resolution

Commenting on IFC’s resolu-
tions, President Norm I-Iimes
said: “The Greek System makes
a great contribution to Home-
coming by building ﬂoats. How-
ever, seven ﬂoats .are not enough
in my estimation.” He urged the V
fraternity representatives to take
the proposal back to their groups,
discuss changes, and give sug-
gestions to the Homecoming Com-
mittee.

 Announces Close  
Spirit Award Race

Student Government has released the results of the
:ﬁrst Spirit Award ratings with a warning that judges will
penalize groups wh ose activities are considered in poo-r taste.

The decision was made after Saturday’s football game,

‘said co-chairman Barbara Goodman, when groups “threw
objects onto the playing ﬁeld, interferred with the half-time cere-

.monies of both schools, and showed disrespect for other groups and
‘their displays.” S

 Results of the‘ ﬁrst.rating among fraternities shows Sigma Chi,
ﬁrst place; Alpha Phi Alpha, second; Phi Gamma Delta, third; Pi

First of all, whatever your major interest-
ﬁnance & accounting, personnel or business
administration, data systems programming,
languages or linguistic research—you can make
use of your college-acquired capabilities with
the National Security Agency, headquarters
for secure communications research and devel-
opment . . . unusual design reﬁnements in com-
puter & edp systems . . . cryptologic and related
techniques. Your professional growth and earn-
ing power expand from the day you join us,

without having to wait for years of "experience." _

Then, too, you will engage in study and
research that will take you well beyond known
and accepted boundaries of knowledge. Al-
though NSA is a key research activity within
the Department of Defense, it has inﬂuence and
responsibility of far greater scope. . . and in-
tellectual associations with leading institutions,
laboratories, agencies and consultants. The art

 

and science of secure communications in all its
ramiﬁcations is utterly without precedent or
resrricn'on, and involves programs of national
importance.

PROQRAMS OF NATIONAL IMPOR-
TANCE—a thought worth repeating. For
what it may be worth to you personally, you’ll
realize an extra measure of satisfaction from
your NSA.work, knowing that the results may
beneﬁt a lot of people. '

In this regard, you’ll ﬁnd, too, that the NSA
interchange-of-information leads easily and
naturally to a maximum extension of your in-
dividual capabilities. You’ll ﬁnd yourself work-
ing with people from an amazing range of
intellectual sectors——philosophy, psychology,
history, international affairs, English, art and
music . . . over 500 of whom have advanced
degrees—in a near-academic environment.

particular are nearby).

One further advantage is NSA’s location . . .
midway between Washington and Baltimore in
an area of fast-growing business, industry, and
research expansion. Take your pick of in-town,
suburban, or rural living-—and enjoy the prox-
imity to the Chesapeake Bay and ocean resort
region.

-If you agree-act now

If you are interested in an NSA career,
you must apply for the Professional Qual-
iﬁcation Test NO LATER THAN WED-
NESDAY, OCTOBER 14th. Your College
Placement Officer has a PQT brochure
and application. (You must be a U.S. citi-
zen, and are subject to a character &

SCOUTING REPORTS

IF STEVE PETRO had scouted for General Robert E.
Lee, there never would have been a Civil War. Lee Would
have surrendered before Fort Sumter.
We heard Petro give a scouting report on the
West Virginia University Mountaineers Tuesday. He
made Gene Corum sound like Hannibal leading his
elephants over the mountains After listening to
Petro’s report We thought it was the Panthers that
were thirteen point underdogs. '

’ PETRO HAS a valid reason for buildinglup the Moun-

taineers higher than Mount Idee. It’s called defense
mechanism. Now, after Petro’s rave notices about
West Virginia, if the Panthers lose, the\Pitt coaches
can point to Petro’s glowing scouting reports.
If the Panthers win, the coaches can point to
Petro’s scouting report, and say they {Won an im-
portant game over a strong, spirited team.

D TO LISTEN to Petro, West Virginia’s quarterback Ed
r Pastilong sounds like a toss between Sammy .Baugh and

Red Grange. But a check of his three-game statistics
shows he has completed only 33 per cent of his passes
_ for 244 yards. He has lost 21 yards rushing. That
gives him a total offense of 223 yards, or five yards
less for the season than Fred Mazurek had against
William and Mary. ‘

 IFOR ONCE, we'd like to hear an honest scouting report

at a press luncheon. We’d like to hear that West Virginia,
- although with a 2-1 record, has two of its wins
against teams of the calibre of William and Mary.
They defeated Richmond, 2-10, and managed only

one touchdown in their 7-3 win over the Citadel. -

Army played the same Citadel team. The Citadel
’ was annihilated. V -
PERHAPS MAZUREK.’ summed up West Virginia best
when he said, “Against everyone else they hardly look
. like a football team. But when they play us, all of a"
sudden they played like eleven all-Americans. They
really want to beat us-”
They sure do. Students at West Virginia had
.,“BEAT PITT” signs up before their football game
with Rice. If the Mountaineers win this game, it will
make their season. We don’t think they can do it.
We’ll take the Panthers in an easy game, 26-8.

West Virginia Eager  Foe   

. s.

For Panthers Tomorrow

At the football luncheon at Gus-
tine’s Tuesday, scout Steve Petra
made the West Virginia Moun-
taineers sound like the Green
Bay Packers, and possibly they
may be that tough facing the Pan-
thers this Saturday. Kick-off time
will be 1:30 at the Stadium be-
for a Parents Day crowd.

“We can’t take West Virginia
lightly,” explained coach John

Michelosen, “this game is their
whole season. Ratings and pre-
dictions don’t mean a thing.”

Last year’s game is an excel-
lent example of what can happen
when heavily favored Pitt team
plays a not so highly rated Moun-
taineer team. In fact more often
than not as the records show
down through the years the fav-
orite doesn’t win.

In fact the scouting reports
show how highly the West Vir-
ginians regard this game. “In his
scouting Report Steve (Petro)
said that West Virginia held out
the ﬁrst team for the last quar-
ter of the Rice game last wee ,”
said Michelosen.

“Also Dick Leftridge played
very little in the Rice game. He
had been hurt, however, Steve

Cubs  Meet Little Mounties
At Morgantown Today

The Panther cubs meet the
Little Mountaineers in a
freshman football game this
afternoon at Morgantown,
West Virginia.

Starting at right end for the
cubs will be high school all-Amer-
ica Bob Longo. Bob Bazylak, an-
other high school all-American
and probably one of the ﬁnest
passers ever to come out of West-
ern Pennsylvania, according to
coach Bill Kaliden, is a roll-out
specialist. .

“He’ll be on his own,” em-
Dhasized Kaliden. The B&L
combination isn’t an inexperi-
enced one. Bazylak’s passing
and Longo’s catching brought
victory to the Big 33 in its
game with the all-staters from
Texas, late in August.

“It should be a pretty inter-
esting afternoon,” said Kaliden.
“Our offense will contain a little
bit of everything from the four
oifenses-——UCLA, Oregon, William
and Mary and West Virginia-
which we have simulated for the
scrixmnages with the varsity.—

West Virginia will employ the

‘ platoon system. “We will use one

I ‘unit on offense only and a sec-

ond on defense,” said coach Ed
Shockey. “That way, more play-
ers will see action.”

-“We’re basically going to use
the same boys on offense and de-
fense,” countered Kaliden. “That’s
the only way we can learn who
can block and who can tackle.”

Dr. R. H. Edwin Espy, gen-
eral secretary of the National
Council of Churches, will speak
on “Made of One Blood” at the
11 am. service on Sunday in
Heinz Chapel.

By BILL CABIN
’,Optimism reigns" supreme on
the soccer team as they antici-
pate a convincing victory over
West Virginia tomorrow at 10
- am.’ at Forbes Field. “Unless we
fall ﬂat on our faces, we should
win handily,” said coach Leo

Bemis".
= -Mountaineer coach Sam Mau-
rice admits that his team is still
inexperienced despite their 2-0
ecord. They defeated Fairmont
in their opener, 3-2, and beat
West Virginia Wesleyan, 4-2, last
week. ‘~~
.. “Their schedule is primarily
- composed of small colleges,”
 said Bemis, “and we're their
« ‘big game. If they beat us, they
ﬂfeel that their season is a suc-
« qcess.”
‘A The Mounties chances of win-
Iiing on Saturday, however, seem
Eslim. “They have one good player

}"Dunlevy, Pa., who transfered
there from Point Park. He’s got
‘a good foot, and was a top scorer
jfO1‘ the Gallatin-Dunlevy amateur
' am,” said Bemis,
. “The only trouble is that they
have nobody to go with him,
since their squad is primarily in-
experienced. I think we’ll be able

gthe team won't .present a prob-

Two weeks ago the Citadel also
stopped the heralded Pastilong

cold. He managed to complete «

only four passes in 15 attempts.
His coach Gene Corum said that
Pastilong “was trying for the
long bomb too much.” However,
the Mountaineer defense contain-
ed the weak Citadel attack and
West Virginia squeaked by, win-

‘ ning 7-3.

The Mountaineers’ opening
210-10 victory over Richmond
was a completely diiferent foot-
ball game. Pastilong and Grid-
dle ripped through the Rich-
mond defense. Pastilong ac-
counted for all three West Vir-
ginia touchdowns’ and ex-Ma-
rine Criddle broke away for 52
yards rushing in just five car-
ries plus three pass receptions
for another 72 yards.
Meanwhile the mammoth Moun-
taineer lines completely domin-
ated Richmond. Huge holes were
opened for the West Virginia
backs and the Spider rushing at-
tack was limited to 54 yards in
32 -carries. However; the Moun-
