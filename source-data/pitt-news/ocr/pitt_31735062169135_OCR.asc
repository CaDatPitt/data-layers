Officials Propose
Means of Financing
College Educations  

White House officials are seri-
ously considering a. proposal to
have the U. S. ﬁnance the col-
lege education of any student
who would agree to pay a life-
time surcharge on his income.

KDKA News visited the cam-

pus Tuesday to interview Chan-

cellor David H. Kurtzmann, Lin-
da Goldstein, editor of The Pitt
News, and Robert Kaplan, for-
mer general manager of WPGI-I,
concerning the proposal. All
three agreed on the general con-
cept of the plan, but each ex-
pressed his doubt as to Whether
it would be effective as it is now
set up.

Dr. John M. Mays of the White
House Office of Science and

-Technology. said the proposal

was “being generally discussed
in Government—-a. number of
persons are involved.”

Opposition is building up in
the Health, Education and Wel-
fare (HEW) Department, where
ranking officials consider the
scheme impractical.

But Treasury, Budget Bureau
and Office of Science and Tech-
nology officials lean toward the
proposal.

The basic idea is this:

>The Government would set
up a revolving fund, or “Educa-
t.-onal Opportunity Bank,” from
which a student could borrow
what he needed for his college
career.

>T-he student would agree to
pay back a ﬁxed percentage on
top of his inco-me tax when he
-went to work. The student -who
became a high-income physician,
for ex-ample, would pay back
more than the student who be-
came a low-income minister.

> An option in the plan would
permit the student who became
wealthy to “buy out” his debt to
the Government with a lump-

- sum payment.

The plan’s “real purpose is to
enable anyone admitted to ‘acol-

  
  
  
 

lege to be able to pay his way
in that college,” Dr. Mays said.
Existing loan programs, run by
private institutions, are not able
to lend large enough amounts.”

Support for the plan has come
from Carnegie-ﬁnanced seminars
held here jointly by Antioch Col-
lege and the Institute of Policy
Studies. B

Christopher J encks of the In-
stitute says under the plan col-
leges could raise tuitions enough
to pay the total cost of educa-

tion. Tuitions todlay pay only a"

a fraction of college costs, with
endowment income and state

' and Federal aid paying the rest.
The Treasury and Budget Bu-‘

reau see the plan as a way to
deal government ‘out of paying
for education cost by eliminat-
ing billions of dollars in subsi-
dies now going to colleges. Mr.
Brewster noted the plan would
permit expenses to be paid “with-
out the hazards you face in di-
rect government interference.”
Bu-t HEW off-icials argue it
would end valuable competition
between private and public col-
lcges and would hang a ﬁnancial
albatross around a student's
neck for all his working life.

The William Pitt Debate
Union (WPDU) recently
spent one month from April
'26 to May 27 in Great Bri-
tain, debating at six uni-
versities on topics ranging
from the perennial Vietnam to
“swinging London.” WPDU de-
baters Armand Belly, Michael
Smith, and Mahmood Mamdani
made the trip.

On April 27, Belly and Mam-..
dani debated at the Cambridge
Union of Cambridge University,
one of the most prestigious of
its kind in the world. Belly and
Mamdani opposed each other,

Fourteen Students Involved
In Latin American Studies

by PAUL STOLLER
(See Editorial, “A Positive Step”—Pa.ge 4)
The recently instituted Latin American Studies Pro-

gram provides the student with real intellectual experie-nce,_

according to Dr. Carl Beck, associate professor of political
science and director of the International Studies Program.

“The Latin American Studies Program,” stated Beck,
“is a very important educational experiment. It strips away
the formality of college classrooms and creates an exciting atmos-

phere for the student involved."

The program, an oifshot of the International Studies Division,
consists of lectures, seminars, and tutorials. The format, in Beck's
opinion, provides an informal educational atmosphere which is con-
ducive to successful and worthwhile learning. L

“At this time, I -am very happy with the program,” stated Beck.
“I recently talked to a number of the students involved and they
were very enthused about all the aspects of the program.”

There are 14 students and four faculty members involved in ,

the program. “This is almost a three to one ratio of students to

faculty,” stressed Beck.

The faculty members currently teaching in the Latin American
Studies Program are James Molly of the Political Science Depart-
ment, Dr. William J. Smole of the Geography Department, Dr. Juan
Vazquez, professor of Hispanic Languages, and Dr. Mereno of the
Sociology Department. “Thefaculty for the program is excellent
and t'he students are reacting favorably to the quality of their

instruction,” according to Beck,

The 14 students involved with .-the program live, study, and at-
tend their lectures, seminars _and tutorials in a special area of
Amos Hall. “The informal atmosphere in Amos Hall,” stressed
Beck, “provides the student with a. real air of intellectual progress.”

The Latin American Studies Program  not be open to stu-
dents in the fall. But this type of study involving lectures, sem-
inars, tutorials, and other graduate school oriented methods of
teaching will be continued. “Instead of offering the Latin Ameri-
can Studies Program in the future, we will apply this type of
method of instruction to another subject,” said Beck. “Tlhe subject
of study, however, will depend on what faculty members are-av*ail-

able.

A.A.U.P. Meeting

by BEVERLY LOU TAYLOR

Acting Chancellor David H.
Kurztman addressed members
of the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP)
Tuesday evening in the S-U Sup-
per Room. Chancelolr Kurtzman
expressed his appreciation to the
faculty for their support during
his two years in the Ohancellor’-s
office.

He commented that, contrary
to the New York Times’ tag of
“demoralized” upon the Univer-
sity, the budget for faculty sal-
ary increases is a healthy 7.6
per cent," and that next year’s
milar provi-

   

stated that the anticipated fac-
ulty turn-over will be about half
-that of the average for the past
years.

As some of the implications of
the University’s state-related
program, Chancellor Kurtzman
discussed:

>Tuition reduction has indi-
rectly beneﬁtted the school;
there are 6,600 applications for
the 2,000 places in the fresh-.
man class, thus permitting the
school to be more selective.

>The University has been
able to provide education for
many —. students who couldn't
have ‘otherwise afforded it.
> The‘ out-of-state students -tu.i- .

tion has been reduced by $100.
—> The University has seated
J2 .“commonwealth trustees,”
seven of whom are alumni of
the University. Chancellor Kurtz-
man quipped that we are the
cnly school to have on its Board
of Trustees both the president
of United States Steel and the
president of United Steelwork-
ers.
> The University receives in-
creased support. The state gave
us six million dollars last year,
nine million this year, and for
next year the University has re-
quested 12 million. In terms of

for the resolution. -

The manner of debated used
at most British debating unions
is parliamentary debate, in
which a government team, lead

UPT’s Mandrake

Play Survive

by ROBERT L. HOROWITZ _
(Mr. Horowitz will review the
controversial film Ulysses based
on the James Joyce novel in Mon-
day’s paper Pitt News.)
Wednesday evening the
University Theatre present-
ed an enjoyable production
of Niccola Machiavelli’s The
Mandrake at the Stephen
Foster Memorial. Despite
some handicaps, i. e., only

. four and a half Weeks of re-

hearsal ,inconsistent lan-
guage and actor dialet, as well
as some organizational prob
lems, the show provides a most
ententainin g night at the theatre.
The story deals with. the at-
tempts of Callima-co, a young,
weallthy rake,- to m-ake love to
the beautiful, innocent Lucre-
zia. Unfortunately Lucrezia is
-married to Nicia, a dimwitted
lawyer, Call-imaco seeks the help
of the parasitic Ligurio. Ligurio
uses his cun-n-in-g to take advan-
tage of Nicia’s stupidity, to get
I-u'crezia’s confes-sor, Friar Ti-
moteo, to convince her to go
against her morals for the good
she will do, and Lucrezias mo-

n-: ther to get Lucrezia’s mother to

help him work out his diaboli-
cal but successful plans.

John Kri=tch’s portrayal of
Friar Timoteo was excellent.
His performance was by far the
best of all those . on the stage.
He employed many little bits of
action, fondling his money pouch,
bu-tting his feet, blessing every-
one at every chance he got,
which added emensely to his
performance.

Jim Berry had some very good
‘moments. His control both of
voice and action, especially dur-
ing his soliloquies, i.e. when he
spoke of the pain he will go
through before his moment of
pleasures with Lucrezia.

Gregory Lehlane did a ﬁne job
in the role of Ligur-i-o. Ligurio
is the most difficult role to work

with in this play. Not only is it

aissance comedy, The Mandrake.

physically triing, but it is also
a difficult role to perform with
consistence. Dan Nalbach, Lin-
da Citron, Be Lancaster Hayllar,
and Emily Petty performed well.
Ba-rbara Lyon’s small but witty
role as the woman was an extra
added delighlt.

Wandalie Henshaw’s direction,
on the most part, had some
-bright moments, especially dur-
ing the slapstick capture of the
disguised Callimaco, and again
during his unwilling removal
from his love. The moderniza-
tion of the language though
making the script more familiar
with a modern audience wa.s not
consistent and left something to
be desired. Miss Hens'haw’.s
choice of actors and the result
of their joint efforts are worth

The costumes were colorfully
and beautifully made by Cynthia
Kritch. They added a great deal
to the play. The lighting was
spotty. There were some mo-
ments when the actors’ faces
were covered with shadow.

The set was fair, however, the
fountain in the center of the
stage was disconcerting at times.
The props and the actors use

During the Student Government presidential campaign last January,
~ one frequently aired complaint was the deterioration of an advantageous
student-teacher ratio. Students rightfully criticized the growing classes

even in the field courses of their major area of study.

We feel that there is an urgent need to improve the status quo on
this question and must -commend one inroad that has been made towards
giving more personal attention to the individual student: the Latin Ameri-

can Studies Program.

The Program, which is experimental in nature, involves four faculty
members and 14 students, an “almost 3-to-1 ratio of students to faculty,”
as pointed out by Dr. Carl Beck, director of the In_ternational Studies Pro-

gram, under which the Latin American Program falls.

The participating students live, study, and attend their lectures,
‘seminars, and tutorials in a special area of Amos Hall. They have a rare
 opportunity to explore their subject matter in a depth that could not be

possible in a regular classroom format.

The most important aspect of an experiment such as the Latin Ameri-
can Studies Program is that it is exploring a new, intensified way of teach-
i-ng that will -be applied to other subjects in the future, according to Dr.

Cur Youthful Generation
Lower Voting Age to 1 8

by Alice Goldsmith

THE GREAT increase in the

 number of young people in our

 

population, as well as the heavy
toll of men needed to ﬁght in
the war in Vietnam along with
the greater emphasis now placed
on youth has led me to advocate
lowering the voting age from
21 to 18.

Lowering the voting age is
not a new idea, it was first pro-
posed in Congress during World
‘War II when a large percentage
of the military forces was made
up of men barely 18 years old.
In ‘his State of the Union mes-

I ' sage in 1954, President Dwight

-ii": '

D. Eisenhower endorsed the
plan and the Senate came with-
in five votes of approving it.
Recently the proposal has re-
gained imxpetus through the
campaigns of Senators Kennedy
and Percy and other freshmen
in congress who direct them-
selves to today's youth and to-
morrow’s voters. However, the
question remains as to why our
youth must be only the voters
of tomorrow, and not of today.
FOUR STATES have lowered
_. their voting ages, even if the
lowered voting age is only ap-
plicable to state and local elec-
tions. In Kentucky and Georgia
the voting age is 18, in Alaska,
19,and in Hawaii, 20. The mere
fact that our two youngest
states have lowered the mini-
mum age shows that they are
confident in the ability to judge
and the intelligence this group

of the population.

The question, If they are old
enough to fight aren't they old

The question, “if they are old
enough to vote?” is the most
emotional argument, it is by no
means the only one. All the in-
dividuals that fall into the 18
to 21 category are either in col-
lege, in the service, working or
following another course of ac-
tion which will make them bet-
ter individuals and therefore
better citizens of the United
States.

Today's 18-year-olds are psy-
chologically ready to vote, be-
cause they have just had high
school courses in government
and are strongly motivated
toward participating in the dem-
ocratic system of government in
which they believe the strength
and power of the world is to
come.

The voting age should, there-
fore, be lowered in order to en-
courage this response and en-

_ thusiasm in the democratic pro-

cess. Frequently, potential vo-
ters lose interest in government
after they have been out of
school for a number of years
and begin to subscribe to the
false notion that the one vote
can not make much a difference.

HOWEVER THIS is a faculty
argument since less than half

P  ‘t’ St  
C Beck. He stressed that “this type of study involving lectures, seminars,

tutorials, and -other graduate school-oriented methods of teaching will be
continued.”

We commend the initiative of the founders of this Program and feel

that this is a definite step in the right direction. As our enrollment in-
creases, there is always the inherent danger of resorting to lecture classes
of several hundred students to resolve the dilemma of a larger student

population. Always we are experiencing overcrowded classes, much to our

discomfort and displeasure. For all intensive purposes, the goal of a rea-
sonable student-teacher ratio has been abandoned.

While we wholeheartedly, applaud the Latin American Studies Pro-
gram, we do feel that it is- but one inroad towards a more personalized
relationship between students and faculty. There is a much more grave
need, however, to concentrate on attaining a more satisfactory student-

teacher ratio that will beneﬁt our student body at large.

any given election and a large
number of elections are won by
slim margins. One needs only
to be reminded of the, late Pres-
ident John F. Kennedy's victory,
over Richard Nixon and even
our recent Student Government
election in which Ken Frederick
won by only 144 votes.

The advocates who back a
congressional amendment to
lower the voting age include
a list of about 34 senators and
30 representatives. This impres-
sive list of leaders ranges across
the political spectrum and in-
cludes the leaders of both ma-
jor parties. Should this bill be
passed in Congress, it would
then have to be ratified by
three-forths (38) of the states,
before it could become an

amendment.

If ratified before the 1968
Presidential Election, this
amendment would add almost
seven million new voters to
the polls. The impact would
even be greater in years to
come, because of the large num-
ber of teenagers today. Since
the population of the United
States is becoming more youth-
ful and since the population
will be under 25 by i975, the
government and politicians
should plan measures which
will be directed towards making
these individuals independent
and thinking citizens of Amer-
ican society.

Although a sudden increase’

in the number of young voters
could swing an election one way
or another, here is a large num-
ber of supporters who either
think this block of voters would
swing the election their way or
who think todays 18-year-olds
are mature enough to make in-
telligent decisions for the com-
mon welfare of all society. I
believe that, given the opportun-

Is Justice Being Served?

In Defense of Dodd

FOR THOSE who maintain a
dogged belief in the principle of
Justice in this country, the Dodd
case must have caused .a trau-
matic blow of cosmic magni-
tude to their faith. For there is
a malodorousness ri-sing from
this affair that should add to
Lady Justice's blindfold anose-
plug. .

The reams of accusations and
exposes which spewed forth

_from the acid—d-ipped pen -of Col-

um-nist, Drew Pearson, foully
‘gotten by ex-members of Dodd’s
office staff —turned thieves, in
the eyes of the Senate Ethics

Committee were 90 per cent.

spurious.

Dodd’s -relationship with Gen.
Klein and the West German gov-
ernment, and the “Persian Rug
Aﬂiairs” must have been quite
licit. The Committee found it
all quite i-nsubstantial.

‘WHAT THE Committee did
find objectionable, however, was
Dodd’s admitted use of testi-
monial dinner revenues for per-
sonal expenses, seven cases of
double billing -in seven years,
and Dodd’s use of an automo-
bile owned by an inﬂuential
friend.

The latter charges are incredi-
bly trivial. Does seven instances
of. double billing, amounting to
only a few hundred dollars, con-
st-itut’e a major offense when
spread over seven years? It

' might-.

But certainly not when there
were also cases in which Dodd
paid twice. Certainly not when
it was the same accountant who
kept Dodd’s books for those sev-
en years and was ﬁred by Dodd,
and later ran to Drew Pearson,
perhaps for revenge. Certainly
not when no evidence was pro-
duced that proved Dodd either
ordered or was even aware of
the double billings.

IT IS reasonable to expect
Dodd, who besides his awesome
array of usual Senate duties is
a member of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and chairman

~ . by Alan Disler

of the Internal Security Sub-

committee, to be aware of every
entry in his office books?

If Dodd had actually meant
to defraud the government,
would he be satisﬁed with only
several hundred dollars in sev-
en years? It doesn't stand to
reason.

AJS for the use of the auto-
molbile, perhaps it was impro-
per for Dodd to use it, but is
this grounds for censure?

CONCERNING THE use of tes-

timonial money for personal ex- ‘

penses, there are no laws pro-
scribing -the practice. Perhaps
there should be, but there is no
reason to nail Dodd to a cross.

'And insofar as ethics is con-

cerned, who is to say where po;
li~tician’s private life ' is demar-
cated from his public life? When
a Senator is called at home to.
do a favor for a constituent,
does this fall under his public,
or private life.

Furtrhermore, over 300 contri-
butors

they didn't mind Dodd’s person-
al use of the funds. As for the
others, apparently, not one con.
tributor was incensed enough to
complain either to Dodd or to

‘ the Ethics Committee.

According to an American le-
gal tradition, innocence is al-
Way assumeduntil proved other-
wise, beyond reasonable doubt.
By this standard, Dodd should
be in no danger. But he is.

Wrote VS/illiam Buckley, Jr., “I
for one announce the beginning
of a long period of bitterness
against the phony moralizers
who conspired against a brave
and simple man of distinguish-
ed public record, and against

the tribun-al which found him‘ 

-guilty by bill of attainder.”
Dodd has said that he will run
for reelection regardless of the
Senate vote, And if Dodd is to
be condemned or vindica-ted, it
will be by those whose voice is

said. “After totaling it up at the
end of the year, he owed me.

Banner is a coach that does
payoff, however. He rewarded
Bodenheimer with the Philly
trip. The 6-2, 210 pound thrower
has thrown 223 feet in practic
but only 209'feet in competition.

—He’s got it,” emphasized Ban-‘
neI‘- “He just must learn to re:
lax and at V-illano-va, he'll ﬁnd
no pressure.”

Muscle, somthing "which Bod-
enheimer has, is something
which isn't really needed to
throw the javelin. “I've seen lit-
'tle guys toss just as far,” point-
ed out Bodenheimer. “It’s all in
the , quickness, the twist and
snap in your bodylthat counts.”

Tomorrow when the big meet
is completed, some of Boden-

heimer’s “friends” will have ﬁn-.

ished their collegiate ‘careers.

For the tracksters, half miler Roger Holly and javelin thrower Wayne Bodenheimer are
the only entrants. It will be the initial appearance for each athlete.

When Roger Holly trots

. around the Stadium track

-durng practice he looks like
a limp ostrich. But when he
makes his move, his kick, in
a tight race, he looks like he's
trying to escape reality.

Actually, th-at’.s how the pale,
tall and loose jointed youth be-
gan his track career. He was
trying to escape. ‘

As any adolescent, he wanted
to prove his physical prowess to
his peers, to himself. He knew
he was fast. He knew also_ he
was a weak runner.

His Butler, Pa., high school
coach made him go out for the
cross country team to strength-
en the legs. “I hated it,” Holly
said bluntly. It was hard physi-
cal conditioning.

Ironically, when head coach-

JimiBanner saw him, Holly had ‘

to run cross crountry again.
Ho1ly’s enthusiasm for the over-
land sport again came forth.

“I hated it then too. But now
it's paying off. My legs are,
stronger and I can withstand‘
greater distance,” explained Hol-
ly. It's ironic how a coach’s
seemingly unwise decision be-
comes just the right decision
when an athlete reaches suc-
cess. '

Watching Holly over the past
year-, Banner called him the most
improved runner on the team.
He was speaking. relatively, com-
paring Holly’s first and second
seasons.

“I didn’t do a damn thing last
year,” blurted the 6-2, 165 pound
junior. Now he runs in three
events, the 440 hurdles, after
switching from the quarter mile,
the mile relay, and the half mile.
In Philadelphia, he will stay
solely with the ‘half mile.

Although he's inexperienced
and has shown it at times, Holly
has picked up tips from Banner
and from competition. His best
time in the half mile is 1:53, but
Banner feels he can lower it.

“I don’t know whether this is
a certain plateau for me or not.
I hope I can live up to what
coach Banner feels is my po-
tential,” Holly said. i

“He has told me to stay with
the pack at the IC4A’s. Stay

with the more experienced run- '

ners. Pull away when they do.
And kick in the stretch, if I can,
when they do,” pointed out Holly.

Holly wants to run the open-
ing quarter of the half mile in
53 ﬂat. He said too, that he
“must” better his best time to
qualify for the ﬁnals where the
cutoff usually comes at 1:49 or
1:50. “Ihope I get in a fast heat

-for the trials,” he added.

At Villanova, Holly will -run
against experience... If he is
placed in a heat with either the
VVi1dcats' Dave Patrick or Ford-
ham’s Jack Fath, there’s a bet
he'll get his wish.

Tomorrow In Twinbill

With Rival

Duquesne

by -MIKE BROURMAN

The city college baseball championship will be decided

this Saturday when the mitters entertain Duquesne in a
doubleheader at Leech Farm. Game time is 1 pm.

A pair of victories earlier this week raised‘ the Pan-

thers’ record to 12-3 while the Dukes show a 10-5 slate.

Last year, the mitters won both games, 12-0 and 4-3.
Dave Welty (5-1) and Don Stock (2-2) will hurl the ﬁnal games

(4-2) and Mike Creighton (2-1).

vforthe Pant-hers, while Duquesne will counter with Jim Oldenberg

Coach Bobby Lewis’ mittens brought their lumber with them
this week against st. Francis and Allegheny. ”

Against Allegheny at Meadville Wednesday, the Panthers wast-
ed no time in asserting their power. They drove out starting pitch-
er Ken Herrick with seven runs in the ﬁrst, then coasted to an

11-2 victory.

‘ Denny Wingert-sahn, with relief help from Stock, posted his
fourth win against no defeats in his sophomore season.
In the big ﬁrst inning, with one down Tom Beckett tripled
over the left ﬁelder’s head and Welty doubled him home. Welty
scored when the left fielder dropped Ken Cookes liner for a two

base error.

Successive singles by Steve Kienzl, George McKenzie, Tom
"Smith and Chris Mitchell and a double by Tom Srtickel drove Her-
rick out and put the other ﬁve runs across the plate. '

Mitchell, Cooke, Kienzl, McKenzie and Srtickel each had a pair

of hits to lead the Panthers.

With the score standing at 8-0 in the second inning, one Alle-
gheny player was heard muttering, “I hope they score one more
so it's 9-0 and we can call it a forfeit and go home.” Unfortunately
for him, all nine innings were played, but the mi-tters, under assis-
tant coach and trainer G. Wilson “Will” Myers, substiuted liberal-
ly in an effort to keep the score down.

“We don’t want to pour it on: 'We may want to play them

again,” said Myers astutely.

It took a little longer for the attack to get rolling Tuesday at
Leech Farm against St. Francis, but when it started the results

were the same.

The Frankies got off to a fast 3-0 lead against Gary Laidig,
then saw their chances fade as the Panthers pushed across two
runs in the third, seven in the fourth, and added four more in the

ﬁfth enroute to a 14-4 win.

fourth inning was a nightmare. In two-thirds of an inning he was
touched for two hits and gave up six walks. After the ﬁnal walk,
St. John simply ran off the mound in disgust and headed (for the

runs if he was moved up in the batting order, kept his word by

Last year, Nichols’ singles

helped him improve, noted Nich-

, 01s, “is that this year I’m think-

ing more instead of just hitting
the ball.’.’

This is the second year playing in the coveted ﬁrst

Nichols describes himself as
“a consistent and opportunist
player who must constantly

singles, he feels that he’s a bet-
ter doubles player than singles
player. Nichols gives a candid
reason for that. “I feel more
relaxed in doubles and find it a
more enjoyable game. I-can play
it with a sort of care-free atti-
tude, knowing that if I make a
mistake, there is a good chance
that my partner can cover for
me.” .

Nichols’ partner this year is
junior Bill Goldstein. Together
they have beaten eight oppon-
ents while losing to two. “Gold-
stein’s style is an aggressive one
which complements my steady,
opportunist play,” comments
Nichols. “We click together.

“In the last two matches
against Grove City and Game-
gie Tech, we really had to exert
ourselves as the competition was
truly stiff for the ﬁrst time this
year,”_ recalls Nichols, “but we

pleasing to Nichols because he
was able to play “guts tennis.”
“I feel better winning a gutsy

Nichols, “I had to play. a defen-
