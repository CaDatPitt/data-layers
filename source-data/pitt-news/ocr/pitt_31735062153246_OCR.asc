nights’ run of the annual Cap and
Gown ‘Club production, “Done and
Undone,” at the.Nixon Theater, Tar-
entum, last Monday and Tuesday

brey Schoﬁeld, Louis Fushan, William
Cadwallader, Max Loevner, Harvey
Harman and Ralfe O. P. Silverman.
J". D.‘Duve, Phil «Small and the Uni-

with sparkling melodies, went across
and made a show that willbe remem-
bered.

SENATE Sllliﬁlisls PLAN
.H1N NIHNINNNNN NP
FIIIITBALL TIEIIETS

‘Action has been taken by thg‘Stud-
ent Senate in connection with seat
distribution at Forbes Field f‘ the
football season. The preserft ruling in
that respect is: ,

“Alumni can secure a box ofeight
seats as long as the supply-of boxes.
lasts. In case they have four members
of immediate family and make special
requisition for same, they can get
total of four reserved seats. All others
get two. Students can get two tickets
for members of immediate family, and
if they desire can exchange their stud-
ent book for two more seats, giving

them a total of four.”

A new plan has been tendered by
the Athletic Council, which will be
taken up in the next meeting of the
Senate:

Alumni can secure two tickets each,
this including box seats and reserved
seats. Students who are holders of
athletic books to get two ﬁrst ﬂoor
reserved tickets for use only by mem-
bers of their immediate family. No
exchanges can be made on student
athletic books, When ordering they
sign a form, stating tickets are to be
used by members of their immediate
families. Said form also to read that
party getting tickets is familiar with
ruling of the University Board of Trus-
tees that any person found guilty of
“sdalpin-g” tickets will be immediately
expelled. .

The following was proposed:
Blanks for ordering tickets would be
secured -at Director Miller’s oﬂice,
Trees Gymnasium. There would be
a certain date, approximately two
weeks before each game, which is the
last date on which orders can be
ﬁled.

The garduate manager would have a
clerk stationed at Director Miller’s
oﬂice from 2 to 5 o'clock every after
noon from opening of school until the
end of the football season, who will at-
tend to distribution of order blanks
and receiving of orders. All orders to
be turned over to him and tickets
paid for at the time. *-Student ath-
letic books to -be presented at the
time.

On the day after closing date for
receipt of orders, all blanks to be
placed in a -box, and shaken up. Presi-
dent of Student Senate, or some one
appointed by him, then to make draw-
ings and orders to be ﬁlled in the
rotation they are drawn by him.

Ir order to give students opportun-
ity to get some of the best seats for
members of their immediate family,
and so that their orders will not have
to be ﬁlled after all the Alumni or-
’ ders are taken care of as in the past,

 

reserved sections of ﬁrst floor, as long
as the supply lasts, viz: Alumni in
section 1, students in section 2, Alum-
ni in section 3, students in section 4,
etc.
Tickets supplied on all student or-
ders to be mailed to the parties order-
ing them from the oﬁi-ce of the Grad-
uate Manager of Athletics.
The foregoing plan of distribution
is to be explained inaletter furnished
to students when they secure their
student athletic books.

The Inter-class Chess Tournament
has so far been featured by the win-

ning play of the Freshmen, who are at
present far ahead of the, other con-
tenders, having won 10 games out of
16, with a percentage of .625. The
records of games won by the other
classes are respectively: .Sophomores
3 out of 7, percentage .429, and Juniors
4 out of 11, percentage_.364. However,
only a small percentage of the sched-

fortunes is entirely possible.

The Penn State Chess Club, which
has been newly organized, has sent a
challenge to the Pitt Chess Club for
a match to be played some time during

Senatorial discussion opened Wed-
nesday, March 16, with a consideration
of the Freshman-Sophomore free-for-
all. The discussion was to the effect
that the Senate should have a number
of upper class men, to control and ref-
eree any ﬁghts that. should occur be-
tween the contestants. The opinion of
the Senatepwas that such contests
should be conducted under a set of
rules in ord~er""to' miniinizze-’tl1‘e» danger
of physical injury. A committee of
three senators was appointed to take
charge of such affairs.

Rose Fine, chairman of the commit-
tee for revision of the constitution of
the Senate, was granted a small appro-
priation to cover expenses in ascer-
taining the character of senatorial con-
stitutions in other schools.

A motion was adopted by which a-
committee of seven Juniors ‘and
Seniors will sit once a week at the
Sophomore tribunal, to see that fair
decisions are accorded the Freshmen.
The committee consists of Short‘, Cos-
cia, Henry, Hamilton, ‘Smith, Ross and

amount of .alumni support than ever
before. _ During the past week 3,000

circular’ notices, ’with order blanks,

were sent to the Plttites living in
Pittsburgh and orders’ have been
coming in -steadily’ ever since. Many
of the. 'out-of-town alumni, who have
been reading of the club’s activities
in The Weekly- have sent in orders
on the, blanks published on this page.

The fact that ‘the club is -turning
over the proﬁts-of this year's. -shows
to the “Alumni _Hall’.’ Fund has

stiru-ck a popular chord with ‘ every-~,

one-—alum_ni, students and all Pitt-

crowds will turn out to all perform-
ances that»will pack the Schenley

April 9, ‘is Alumni Night and the

week ‘for a long chat, at which time
he unfolded some of his plans for

‘boosting his particular specia.lty——

ent day cheer le’ad3ers,- “Jimmy”
hopes to make ‘Pitt’s cheering next
fall the bestow the land. He wants
the fans to talkfas much about Pitt
cheering ‘and Pitt spirit as they do
about -the Pitt football team, itself.
And with the plans he has,‘ there is
no reason why this won't be worked
out. ‘. . — . -

Scott has been in New York for
the past ﬁve months, taking a. spe-
cial training course with Lee, Hig-
gin-son & Company, investment bank-
ers. He has 'now- been assigned to
their Pitt:sburgh;' » office, A Common-
wealth Building. “While in- New
York, Scott attended one of the pro-
fessional football. games there and
it -impressedi him with the impor-
tance of a cheerleader, just as ..the
several professional games at Forbes
Field did to Pittsburghers. “I am
coivinced,”.vsa.id _lJi1li- to ‘the writer,
“that the college cheerleader has i an
important part at football games and
I thinkit is an activity that can be
developed to .a. high degree of per-
fection.’ So I am going to do my
little bit ‘for Pitt there.” Hurrah for

V THE LAST LAP A,

T v 7 ,.The time has come for us to sprint.‘ For we are on the l-ast

,“ l,ap.,:of.our school year. , As we start back to school after our ‘Easter

-va,cfation_all of-us doubtless are making resolutions that willuinsurel A A

.’”ah?"{ﬂying ﬁnish.” Our position now is an‘ advantageo‘11s,.oi1e.. We
' 's,till}have enough time -to correct glaring mistakes of the year,,lto
L   "out plans so hopefully begun last October. If our school‘ life
.  been ’wells-“ordered and regulated .thr‘oughout the year,‘ our
1  the home stretch will be just a matter ofipleasant exercise.
Bul;l.if  have procrastinated and delayed, let things slip along, then
;  Eh “ be? a lung-testing drive‘ in theilast part of the course- A _' E

I  ‘ [Seniors who will soon depart with their; diplomas, are reminded.
 that there is much to be done before graduation. A let-up of energy

, .atfth_is. time isnot to -be desired. Those who willreturn’-next year
would do well to look forward a little and takeinotice just how
 much advantage they will derive from a systematic winding up of

thisyear.’s aﬂairs in the remaining months of school. i

 ‘ V A FINE SEASON‘
The» Pitt girls’ basket ball team has added ‘another perfect

V eco dto7its,<co1lection of six undefeated seasons in-‘as many years.
'¥’l2h:ts°year’s team, which won nine games over. teams such as West-
 Geneva, Beaver, Thiel_ and Slippery Rock Normal, was
 by‘Lemon Arnold, ’20, and managed by Katherine Saunders.
 théjl°James was captain. ' The guards did remarkable work thrbugh-

A  "bud-the entire year, holding the opponents in several games without

goal and in allbut one game to two baskets. Scarcely less

, g of credit are the centers who succeededin keeping the ball

_   .opponent’s territory. Cracklshooting marked the play ,
f 3’ of  ‘forwards, who ‘averaged four to six baskets apiece per

‘ , Theesubstitutes performed ably when called upon. Theplay-V

_ the team was characterized by clean, hard playing. The girls

.. V. bitedgwonderful spirit ‘and. received much favorable‘ comment
 l"’awfayh from home. Only ..one_member of the regular team will be

in V  graduation, sothat the girls have bright prospectsfor next. »

‘Three 1iew_”Alleghen€y‘-Moun~tla.in ‘As-
sociation of A. A.  records ,were
established_ 'S'a.tu'rday ‘week . at their
Indoor Championships at’ ‘theft East
End'Audito'rium, and two of the marks
were lowered by Pitt -‘men. Pitt ﬁn-
ished Lsecondi to P. A. A. in ‘the. ﬁnal
‘point score after crowding the club
athletes the whole way, but the
splendid showing off some of‘ the men
more than offset the fact that the
"point trophywas not won,» inasmuch
as Shea, Allen, Martin and Capers‘

The two-mile record was lowered
by “Esler Hays; in his. first race‘ in
competition. in the splendid time of
10:01." This. ibrands,Hays as a. future
star ofgthe first magnitude as _it is
equivalent to;a'bout 9:35 on a L good
outdoor track. _LHe had.Llittle. or no
difficulty in defeating Grover Caughey,
P, A. A.’s star, who held on to‘a.bout
the tenth lap and then found the pace :
too fast. A’Hearne had. third place
cinch-ed but became mixed up on the
only 23‘ laps, being dis-

‘qualified.  C — V . z
, Robusch added the second record,
clearing the bar in the high jumpat
50 feet 10 inches and barely missing
at 6 feet. i’His‘ -mark was 92 inches bet-
ter than the old records-. Brickley.
Wakeﬁeld and Fawcettall ran well in
the 300-yard run, winning their heats,
and the first two ﬁnishing second and
third respectively in the ‘ﬁnal. ‘Sim-
ilarly Pyle and Rylander were third
‘and fourth in the 1000-yard run. Pitt’s
remaining three points were made by
"Capt. Thornton, who was forced to
take second place to ’McNei1Aof- West-
inghouse in the 12-pound shot put. Mc-
Neil broke the old record, Tom him
self coming within three inches‘ of it.
