Point Par/< Launches Fund Drive

by JIM HOSEK .

Point Park College (PPC) stu-
dents. alumni and faculty mem-
bers last week launched a cam-
paign to raise enough money “to
the financially troubled
school alive.“

PPC, which needs at least $1
million, was unable to meets its
monthly payroll at the end of
May or to make state mortage
payments that amoun_t to about
$300,000, according to Thomas
M. Kerr. vice—chairman of the
College's trustees.

As a result of the financial prob-
lems,.PPC’s faculty voted last
week to demand the resignation
of Arthur Blum as president. He
announced his resignation Satur-
day, and John V. Hopkins, vice-
president and academic dean, was
named acting president.

In addition to these problems.
the school is in court contesting
claims by the‘ city and county
that it owes $1.1 million in delin-
quent property taxes. \

Called in to help Point Park was

w Pitt’s chancellor emeritus David

Kurtzman. He will head a.finan-
cial advisory committee, but
stressed that this role was not one
of getting money to keep the Col-
lege alive, but mainly to help by
making recommendations.

A college sorority. however.
has decided to take some of the
money raising efforts on their
own. Sigma Delta Sigma (SDS) is
coordinating a "pennies for Point
Park " donation drive in the West-
ern Pennsylvania area.

Darlene Mastandrea. SDS pres-
ident. hopes that $400.000 will be
raised by asking three million
Western Pennsylvanians to give
13 pennies—significant of the 13
years PPC has been in existence.

“This is a damn good school,”
said Point Park’s radio station
manager Mark Bursic.’ “We’re

' not going to let it all go under. A

united effort can save this place.”
This remark. however. cannot

. be attributed to all PPC students.
Adrianne Charapp. a sociology

major, said that she was trans-

fering to Duquesne University be-

cause of all the problems PPC is
now having.

"The school." she said. "is
really going under.wThey have a
poor sociology program. and the
school is just too expensive."

Dave Marchick of the theater
department said that he would not
even think of transferring at the
present time.

He claimed that he did not care

too much what happens to the rest
of the school "as long as the dance

~ and theater programs at the Play-

house and Ballet Theatre contin-
ue as they have been."

Because of the dance and bal-
let departments’ association with

Smith Urges Coordination of Efforts

Task Force, City

by MICHAEL CLINTON

A Parking Meter Symposium
was held in the Student Union
Wednesday evening to disucss
parking problems faced by Pitt's
night students.

The meeting revolved around

the efforts of the Parking Task
Force Committee of the General
Studies Council. whoihave been
acting as the representatives for
approximately 6,000 students
who attend night classes in the
School of General Studies.

According to Marikay Jung,
administrator of the Council, “A
survey taken in 1971 of 1,970 night
school students showed the park-
ing meter situation to be the
greatest obstacle to attending
evening classes at Pitt.” She ex-

  Cutbac/<sForCe V
Layoff of .44 lanitors

by DAVE MAJERNIK
Recent cutbacks in the Univer-
sity‘s custodial forces have caus-
ed fears that maintenance serv-

‘ ices would be severely curtailed.

Student Government President.
Bege Kaufman met with Chancel-
lor Posvar June 5 to discuss the
recent layoff of 44 custodial
workers at Pitt.

Kaufman said he wanted to
make sure maintenance services
in the Student Union building
would-not be decreased. He said
Posvar assured him the cutbacks
would notrseriously effect main-
tenance in that building and only
administrative offices would be
cleaned less frequently.

David Glavin. president of set-v—

...,‘ ice Employees International Un-
ion Local 29. which represents the

400 custodial workers at Pitt. con-
firmed the layoff of the 44 jani-
tors. - --

Glavin maintained that the lay-
off was perfectly legal since funds

to the University had been cut.

back. and said the situation in no
way reflected hard feelings be-
tween the union and the Univer-
sity. The workers were laid off
according to seniority. he said:
The workers who remain, Glav-
in said, are not allowed to be forc-

ed to do extra work,to make up

for those laid off. ‘-

According to Glavin. the union
is putting pressure on the state.
through the legislators. to in-
crease allocations to Pitt.

Bill Acker. manager of Facil-
ities Maintenance and in charge
of all custodial personnel. said
manyservices will not be as fre-
quent as before. “For example."
he said. "some floors are now
done every three nights instead
of every other night.“

Public areas such as balls,
classrooms, rest rooms have first
priority, said -Acker, while of-
fices will bear most of the effects
of the service cutback.

No more layoffs are expected
in the future. he said. and if the
University gets additional funds
from the state. someof the laid
off workers will be called back.

Student Union Manager Terry
Melani reported: "We haven’t yet
experienced any problems. Serv-
i-ce hasn't appreciably changed.“

Many workers, however, were
loss optimistic than their union
leader and bosses, claiming there
is an increase in their work load
because of the cutbacks. some
workers expressed dismay be-
cause they had to neglect some of
their own work to cover those

laid off. Others said they were i

Smith. who spoke Thursday at-

a conference-seminar on, “The
Urban Consumer," held in Bene-
dum Hall. said that Americans
have yet to define themselves “as
resources that determine whether
a business or government will
survive." A '

The _absence of consumer
awareness, said Smith, stems
from incomplete understanding

of the economic system. The con-
sumer, he explained, is ignorant
of what his rights are, and does
not realize that the expenditures
he makes determine his position
in the economy.

‘ “Whenever you purchase bad
food or housing. or pay for serv-
ices you don't receive, you dic-
tate on what terms you will accept
goods and services." Smith de-
clared.

"It would be ‘constitutionally
inappropriate’ for President
Nixon to be subpoenaed before a

' federal grand jury investigating

the Watergate scandals." said
the White House last week. ac-
cording to the New York Times.

The issue arose when the W'hite

House disclosed that Nixon had .

logs of conversations with ex-
counsel John Dean. III. but
would refuse to make them
available to the investigators.

The Times later reported that
Presidential counsels announc-
edthat the logs will be released
to the Ervin Committee some-
time this week.

But despite these develop-
ments. a serious legal and po-

litical question remains.

The media._ especially "televi-
sion. is also toiblame for the con-
sumer's present state. according
to Smith. Buyers, he said. have
been “programmed" to behave in
a certain way through their con-
tact with media advertising.

Smith noted that the media has
allowed business to influence

what goes on the air, since com- ,

merical stations depend on ad-
vertising money to produce pro-
grams. He described it as one
..indication that “we are no long-
er concerned with people, but

' with the accumulation of dollars

and cents.” -

"Another danger to consumers.
Smith maintained. is the concen-
tration of power in industry and

mer protection agency was pro-
posed nationally. big business mo-
bilized immediately to stop it. The
one way to get law promulgated
is to muster the organizational
clout of consumers to fight back.“
Fragmented governmental ef-
forts was cited by Smith as a ina-
jor factor hurting the consumer
cause. Federal. state. and local
agencies are not working to-
gether as they should. he said.
"When the constituency. an
agency. is supposed to serve
needs solutions to problems and
that agency is unable to help. the
constituency loses faith and be-
comes alienated." added Smith.

Consumer information organ-
izations, Smith believes, can play
several valuable roles:

I) They can educate the buyer
about his rights and warn him
about unjust business practices;

2) They can provide leadership
for mobilizing consumer power;

3) They can act as a coordinat-
ing body to direct people with

problems to the agencies most
likely to help them in specific
areas. such as housing. health
care. or legal services.

Smith's own organization. set
up in 1968 under the Office of
Economic Opportunity. has serv-
ed mainly as a troubleshooting
organization which worked iwth
specific consumer complaints.

were “costly programs that

Kurtzman said that his advice
a year ago to Blum was to get rid
of these programs and was refus-

ing the Playhouse, contributed to
the College's current financial
crisis.

U.S.W To Hold Elections

by DREW PORVAZNTK

Union elections for offices in
the linited Steelworkers of Amer-
ica. Local 1397. will be held June
11 at the Homestead headquarters.

Local 1397 is the union local for
the llomestead Works of the Unit-
ed States Steel Company and is
the largest union local in West-
ern Pennsylvania with 7.300
members. At one time Local 1397
was the largest union local in the
nation with 14.000 members and
the Homestead Works had the
largest amount of steel produc-
tion in the world.

Funds

A state fact-finding team. too.

has urged Point Park to “divest
its interests“ in three cultural af-
filiates — the Pittsburgh Play-
house. Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
and the American Wind Symphony.

The recommendations. which
also included a drastic reduction
in administrative staff. were
prepared by the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Facilities Au-
thority tPHEFAi after PPC offi-
cials informed the state that it
could not make its mortgage pay-
ment.

The PHEFA report also recom-
mended that the College “liqui-
date tangible assets not required
for current operations,” referring
to the college-owned Lester A.
Hamburg Conference Center in
Lawrence-County, which is valued
at $300,000. It has been used for
fund-raising and entertaining by
administrative officials.

The report also called for the
termination of the school lease
on a $110000 a year lease in
Switzerland. where some PPC
students are getting an education.

The closing of PPC would mean
that 445 persons would be out of
work and that over 2.000 students
would have to find another school
to attend.

Other activities being planned
besides the "Pennies for Point
Park" campaign are a Pittsburgh
Playhouse benefit performance of
Carousel June 17, a Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre performance.

The offices up for election in-
clude president, vice president,
treasurer, financial and record-
ing secretaries, journal agent,
inside and outside guards, and
trustees.

For the presidency of Local
1397. “Babe“ Fernandez is chal-
lenging incumbent Ray Anderson
who received wide publicity for
his active support of George Mc-
Govern last year and his attempts
to get the United Steelworkers of
America to endorse the candida-
cy of McGovern at the USWA con-
vention.

Candidate Fernandez heads the
unity slate of union office hope-
fuls. Also on the unity slate is Ed
Wargo who is running against
Andy Polemba for the post of
treasurer‘.

Wargo said that the slate hopes
to cut union costs and to put the
union on a more sound basis. He
added that the slate favors “more
stringent control over economic
matters of the union.”

,Wargo said specifically that
the unity slate is working for a
30 year. full pension regardless
of age. double time paid for work
on Sundays. and the right to
strike on safety matters.

This last issue implies that if
an unsafe working situation
arises and the compamy fails to
take necessary measures to cor-
rect the safety hazard. then the
local would have the right to
strike. This would shut down op-

erations in the mill until the haz-
ard is eliminated.

Wargo added that a major goal
of the local is to see that work is
done safely and that workers
aren’t injured. He said that job
safety is a joint effort where the
union and company work together.

In other matters. Ed Wargo
said that steel unions have made
progress including workers pen-
sions. insurance. full hospitaliza-
tion. cost-of—living increases and
one of the best Blue Cross—Blue
Shield programs of the nation.

Unions have also been a prime
force behind making job safety a
necessity according to Wargo.
He said that working in the mills
years ago was “very treacher-
ous.“ -

Now steel mills have become
much safer. Workers are required

to wear hard hats, protective eye '

glasses, gloves and metatarsal
shoes as basics for protection
from injury.

When asked about the unity
slates chances of being elected.
Wargo said he felt confident of
victory provided that all of the un-
ion members come and vote be-
cause "one vote can mean win-
ning or losing.“

The many Pitt students hired
by the Homestead Works for sum-
mer are eligible to vote in the un-
ion elections since they automati-
cally become union members

- when they begin their jobs.

Subpeona Issue

(Continued from Page 1)

"The House of Representatives
has the right to investigate the
Executive Office through the
power of impeachment. There-
fore they maintain the privilege
to subpoena. presidential docu-
ments," said Kronfeld. "Then.
technically, the President has no
power to withhold papers, or logs
from the Congress.” —

Contrary to this view, former
Attorney General Richard Klien—
deninst. has said that while the
House holds _the power to im-
peach, the mandate comes from a
two-thirds majority vote, and not
necessarily from sufficient evi-
dence. ’ '

Kliendeinst continued that since

no evidence is neededto convict,-
none must be given when asked.

Dr. Richard Seeburger, Pitt
law professor and former stu-
dent of Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox, agreed with Eu-
nice Ross that the subpoena issue
has political implications.

"There is that certain immun-
ity in high offices to preserve the
separation of powers. The Presi-
dent is immune to the service of
process while he is in office.
much like the position of a diplo-
mat in a foreign country,

‘-‘In this particular case, the
President may wish to divulge
some of those documentsgor he
may not. That will be up to him.”

Seeburger added that in con-
stitutional questions of theory
such as this, it is wise to think~in
practical terms. _"How are you
going to make the President ap-
pear in court if he doesn’t want
to?“

In these "practical terms,"
William Maloni, special assistant
to Pittsburgh Congressman Wil-
liam Moorhead, told the PittNews,

“The Congress may sub-

poena the President, and the,
White House may choose to lg-
nore it. Logically, the next step
tin criminal cases) is to arrest.

now afraid to complain about
anything for fear of their jobs.

Ma/ny said‘-they dreaded they

him for contempt of court. But
this is a political situation.“ '

Maloni concluded, “In this case,
both branches of government (the
Senate and the Executive) would
wait on a decision from the third
branch—the Supreme Court. As
yet, they have made no such de-
cisions.”

In 1807, a precedent to the exe-
cutive subpoena issue was made
in the case, United States v. Aaron
Burr.

Chief Justice John Marshall
wrote in that case that Burr had
the right to subpoena Thomas
Jefferson for treason charges
and to subpoena related docu-
ments.

This ruling is noted frequently
by Senator Sam Ervin and mem-
bers of his committee, who are
seeking evidence in the Water-
gate conspiracy scandals.

The case is also mentioned by
those experts who do not agree
that it is legal to subpoena the
President, because Jefferson~did
not appear in response, and the
courts did nothing to enforce the
principal.

TWO Pitt students qualified for
Sigma Delta Psi, a national hon-
orary athletic fraternity for men.
Trackster Bill Rea, a senior, and
soccer player Jerry Kruth, a
graduate student, achieved the
honor by meeting requirements

Veterans

‘Editor:

I First, I would like. to thank the
Editors for their continuing sup-
port of interest in Veterans.

, However, the Thursday, June

(7, 1973 Pitt News carried on its

'- front page an article by Eugene
Sanders in which I was misquot-
ed and certain projects concern-

‘-3 " ing Veterans were misrepresent-
" ‘ ed.

To begin with, as most any
‘veteran knows, the single ex-GI
in school -full-time receives $220

7-mo. not $225. (I hope the V.A.
, did not receive any calls de-
I ‘manding that extra $5.)

_ A While the article does make
- the point that, “Because the G.I.
Bill provides ‘insufficient funds,
many Vets can’t afford to go to
college,” non-veteran students
must realize that that $220/mo.
the_Vet receives often eliminates
H him or her from receiving loans,
  jscbolarships, work-study or any
  other grants based upon need.
 Non-vets must also realize that
 . Vets do not receive free tuition,
  -books and housing as was the case
with the WWII GI Bill.

‘ One of the projects I am cur-
nrently developing is the ex—serv-
iceman in Transition Center

_ (EX-IT), misrepresented as "Ex-
,GI‘s in training.” This project

_..will- NOT be an alternative to

  the. Veterans Administration in

Vanyway. We hope to be working
‘directly with the V.A. in a co-

. operative fashion to supplement
I ‘_ their efforts in Allegheny

, “County. The V.A. cannot do ev-
I ¥_.’-‘erything nor are they mandated

 by‘ the Federal Government to

~_g,do/ everything. The EX-IT Cen-
 ter. will provide an ex-GI-to-ex-

‘VGII link to ALL agencies that

' provide se_rvice to veterans.

 The EX-IT Center is not a
 l‘,'Pennsylvania State Program"
 as was implied by the article.
" It is not funded by the “Junior
 GI'Bill." The so-called “Junior
_ "GI Bill" is a bill pending in
 Harrisburg that will provide a
:; yjsupplement of $50/mo. to that
‘g which the student/vet receives
 from the Federal GI Bill. This
" "$50/mo.‘ will be paid directly to
 the student/vet, and will not pro-

 vide funds for the EX-IT Center
' ‘L  or anything like it. .

 

/1,

 
 

The article concluded with a

 statement I did not make, that,
.  '““Veterans are a7 great source of
 manpower that this "country
' should not ignore.” While the
 . statement is true, it does not ex-
. " press my personal motivations for
 working to,benefit veterans. I am

‘ interested in generating public

 interest in benefits and services

-I  for veterans so that today's vet-
  eran can make choices about his
1- fzafuture. If the GI Bill were ade-
. ' quate to providing a college edu-
’ —_ cation for veterans, then young
_ veterans could have- the option
‘  to rise out of poverty, to‘ explore
1 » himself in a humanistic academ-
 ic environment, to re-involve
., i "' himself in our society, and to re-
,1 I,,_‘.»: habilitate himself and overcome
H the guilt and alienation produc-
 ed in him by having to fight in
tfthe. shameful racist war in In-
 dochina. A college education for
 theilvet will, of course, also
_-,3’. better his chances among the
in competitive hordes on the em-
 ployment market.

. _ When one realizes‘ that this
_ War was fought largely by the
EA/poor and the Black and that only
" I about 4% of veterans from pover-
, , ty and disadvantaged backgrounds
L‘_.,;, -.use_ their GI Bill _educational
 _‘ benefits, then one must conclude

BAS Editorial

(In Response to the Thursday,
June 7, 1973 Editorial.)

It appears" that the all powerful
structured mechanism of the uni-
versity administration has fin-
ally found another weapon to
combat the solitary black stud-
ent organization i.e. the Black
Action Society, on the campus of
the University of Pittsburgh. This
weapon is allocations or funds
on which the organization is run.
These allocations I "understand
come through the blessings and
good graces of the Committee on
Student Organization. The CSO
having the awareness of the dis-
crimination and racist practices
perpetuated’ by white institu-
tions i.e. American Institutions
instilled in their doctrine that
"no organization shall discrimin-
ate on the basis of race, religion
or national origin.“

I know for a fact that this dis-
crimination against Blacks is still
in existence in the society as a
while and its various institutions
such as Universities etc. I feel
,that it would be a mistake for
this Black organization to change
the framework constructed as a
defense against the known dis-
crimination. I feel that it is un-
necessary for ‘the Black Action
Society to include white students
in their membership as long as
the organization as a whole can
work and interact effectively
with other Student Organizations.

. I know that the organization
would not want to see itself
diluted or decreased to the point
"where it is totally controlled by
the powerful structured mech-
anism of the university admin-
istrations. Yet it is improbable

that the organization can func-

tion without funds. and this is

 ,3 :‘_‘>

easily understandable. So the
weapon of allocations (funds)
come into play. It sounds right
that if students moniesare used
they should have a say in the us-
age of it. But it is also true_that
there are many many student or-
ganizations that are funded by
allocations that the Black stud-
ent neither participate in or has
knowledge of.

To expect a man to hold his
hands up and just let you shoot
him down is a little too much. . .

BAS Editorial "B

To:’ Pitt News ‘

This article is in‘response to
the editorial -in the June 7. Pitt
News where it states that the
B.A.S. constitution is discrimin-
atory because of the one clause
that says “the B.A.S. does not
exclude participation from any
student upon this campus so long
as their goals are in accord-
ance with ours."

I can't understand why the
B.A.S. and other black organiza-
tions never get any good publi-
city on this campus? Whenever
we do something well we have to
run around and find the media
to cover it. As soon as a little
clause in our constitution comes
up everyone jumps in the arena
and tries to draw blood.

There .are countless student
organizations, faculty organiza-
tion, and administrative organiza-
tions around and throughout this
university that have constitutions
that read like the bible but in
reality the people are hypocrits
and if a black were to attempt to
join he would be avoided and
made to feel like an idiot’ until
he eventually leaves of his own
accord or until the organization
finds a reason to get rid of him.

The B.A.S. is not a hypocritical
organization. We try to be hon-
est. No matter what our con-
stitution says discrimination will
go on as usual. This is nothing
but a play on words. We are a
black organization and we can’t
afford such leisures as word
plays. we are concerned with
reality, the way things really are.

Discrimination manifests itself
because white people perpetuate
it. They can’t come to grips with
their racism. They are the rich
and _powerful majority. We are the
minority. They use fancy words
to cover up what is really hap-

pening. This attack on the B.A.S.

constitution is nothing’ but an-
other way for the majority to
throw their weight around.

If the B.A.S. becomes a black/
white organization it would be
impossible to measure the suc-
cesses and failures of the B.A.S.
as a black organization. This
strategy we realize is a weapon
that ,has been used by the white,
rich and powerful majority
throughout out history and we do

not want this to happen, simply_

because the black student would
once again be without the pro-
per representation within this
highly intelligent, educated, hu-
mane, and efficient institution.

not too subtlely. that those of my

white women (perhaps black
women face the same difficul-

one myself) are, being»vunmerci-

fully persecuted here at the uni-
versity and in the surrounding
community. No. my charges are
not directed at Oakland business-
people or the university adminis-
tration who many complain are
unlikely to hire us and quite
likely to fire us. Those hiding be-
hind their bureaucratic desks con-
stitute the least of my problems.

Those to whom I object are
more likely to frequent the
streets of Oakland or the halls

and elevators of the university.
I am speaking of he who will

Why me? I dress quite de-

self a public spectacle, and I cer-

BAS Editorial

(A response to the June 7, editor-
iai in the Pin News).

I‘m writing in regard to the
June 7th editorial in the Pitt
News concerning the B.A.S. I‘m
very much disturbed by it. I not-
iced nearing the end of the arti-

attempt to engage me in‘

cle it stated. “It is not the pur-
pose of this editorial to question
the need for an organization such
as the B.A.S. This is above dis-
pute." If this is true than I see-
no problem. The B.A.S. is just
as it states . . . the B.A.S.. and if
you're not questioning the need
of what it should be or what you
as a white student thought that
it should be.

I apologize if I'm wrong but
all I see is a play on words and
in that play on words I see a

contradiction and I would appre— ,

ciate. as a student. a black stud-
ent that this be plainly said to
me as well as the many other
students surrounding me. If there
is definately a need for anor-
ganization such as the B.A.S. . . .
and the B.A.S. is exactly now
what it was when it was origin-
ally created, then why are you
questioning it? To question the
B.A.S. is to question its existence
and it was just stated at the clos-
ing of your questioning editor-
ial, that it was notto accom-
plish this.

Vale of Fears

President Nixon traveled thru
this Vale of Fears always hoping
to arrive to the Promised Land."

Andihe saw the lights of the

celestial city afar off.

When he arrived at the gate
he found it guarded by St. Peter.
And he advised St. Peter not to
stand in his way because of his
position of strength he would
force his way in. But St. Peter
said that this place was reserved
for the nonviolent and peace
makers only. And he stood firm.
President Nixon returned back
into the country and in the vi-

cinity of the City of Vanity Fair, _

the earth gave way and he, his

Institutional Truth

By BROTHER KABA
(David Michael Gaston)

I would like to pose a few dis- ‘

quieting questions to students.
administrators, instructors. and
the general public. What is the
truth and purpose of an institu-
tionalized education? Is truth
tau ht as a universal principal.
or are curriculums devised to
mass produce younger and more
capable interchangeable parts.
as the system of government and

society move into areas of more

complexity?
I would like~to present an ap-
proach to developing a door-
way through which a truth could
be reached. ‘A frightening reality.
this: "What do you see the way
it is. and -what do you see be-
cause you were taught to see it‘
that way?" ”
There are many steps to revela-
tion and truth, applied truth is . . .
wisdom . . . . First there must be
universal respect and honesty.
Let the truths of the world be
taught to the world. Turn the
mind not toward pre-set and iso-
lated thought, but find in your
thoughts the power of creative-
ness, innovation, revelation,
and self knowledge, which
should prevent self-destruction!

You find this world to be a di-
versity, and an artificial system.

for example, America's indistinc- ' ‘

tiveness, is the reason for it's in-
ternational pre-eminence, and
is responsible -for its profit and
power.

How undisciplined are your
thoughts reader? You are the end
product of western values and col-
lective consciousness . . . . . . . A
civilization ends in ‘and is reflect-
ed by the individuals it creates!
I have asked thousands, "What
is the American Dream”? No one
knew! Now I_ ask you for ans-
wers: Would one dare .to tell
and teach the truths ’of Mankind.
(Mankind-Kind of man) to ele-
vate common consciousness? Is
this university self satisfying and
alive with the awe of revelation.
operating under conditions that
instill and inspire a learning spir-
it? Life is a total experience.
a tree is bent by the life it had
to grow! If there is no growth.
there is death, for growth is life.
Life, is a total experience! Could
you face yourself as a total hu-
man experience? To see . . . . . . .
And know . .  . SELF! How
would this change the conditions
of your life, in relation t moti-
vation and goals? I hope to have
scattered some seeds of thought. ‘
to raise questions, or eyebrows-

Sticks & Bones--

by JOHN SMITH

Just how far will the American
family go to hand on to the dream‘?
This and other questions are ex-
plained at some length by David
Rabe in his play Sticks and Bones,
the current production of the
Pittsburgh Poor Players.

The drama focuses on a typical
American family-—remember the
lovable Nelsons of yesteryear.
Well. here they are again. Ozzie.
Harriet. Ricky, and David. Ozzie
still lounges on the sofa in front of
the TV, Harriet still makes fudge.

and Ricky still strums his guitar.

David, however, has been away '

at the war. After two years here-
turns, blind. But (as seems to be
the case of blind protagonists
from Oedipus on up) has had his
eyes opened to the horrible real-
ity of war. ‘

Couple this with an affair with a
"yellow whore“ over there. and
you have enough to put a strain on
anyone‘s life—especially Ozzie
and Harriet. .

To present this story. Rabe
uses every technique available to
the modern playwright. There's
realism—the drama of a son re-

sionism comes in the form of a
beautiful Vietnamese girl float-
ing around as David's memories.
The names of the characters as
well as the bizzaree ending con-
stitute absurdism. In short. it's
all there. I

The piece has been highly ac-
claimed—Tony awards, etc. Plans
were made to present it as a tele-
vision audiences. I really don’t
know what all the hubbub was
about. It didn’t strike me as be-
ing particularly fantastic.

As I have mentioned before. the

Wakeman Has Six Wives

by BARBARA GERAUD

It‘s not often that an instrumen-
talist can carry off an entire al-
bum by himself, especially if he‘s
thecomposer of all the selections.
All too often, the end result

‘sounds like the grossest of all

ego trips. monotonous in the ex-
treme, and just plain worthless.

No so, however, is Rick Wake-
man's The Six Wives of Henry
VIII (A&M). Yes the master key-
board wizard has created some of
the most refreshingly innovative
yet classically influenced music
to come on in many a year.

Each of Henry’s wives is de-
picted in an individual composi-
tion—“Catherine of »Aragon”—the
first, the virgin bride. The music
is forceful, yet subservient, be-
fitting her role. '

But the composition is all too
short, as was Catherine’s marri-
age. Her disappointment with her
life at Court andher withdrawal
into the life of the Church are ac-
curately portrayed—the bright-
ness and happiness of the music
decaying into the dirge—like fugues
of a church organ.

“Anne Boleyn‘ ‘-—the honky-tonk
piano theme for the tart she was.
The theme builds slow-ly, then as
the church bells toll her death-
knell (they were always against
her), there is a rushing crescendo

_ as things happened too fast for

Anne to control, building to her
abrupt end of the gallows in a
erash of noise.

“Jane Seymour” — with the

thinkling piano showing her youth"
and childlike view of the world

underlaid by the somber tones of

the church organ at St. Giles,
Cripplegate. Her pregnancy with
the future Prince Edward was the
main part of her life, as it is of
this piece. L

They heavy Moog keyboard runs
ebb and flow, carrying the listen-
er along on their waves, nearly
completely conveying the anguish
and difficulty of her labor and
childbirth.

"Anne of Cl,eves"' was a dom-
estically inclined hausfrau from
the Duchy of Cleves, a basically
German principality. The music
moves with all the air of a coun-
try bumpkin lost in the big city.
This is the one piece where Wake-
man borrows heavily from the
classical, incorporating the theme
from "Hungarian Fire Dance"
into his story.

And the two Catherines —- How-
ard and Parr. Youth and matur-
ity. High spirits and matronly
quietude. Promiscuity and fidel-
ity. The two pieces present def-
inite contrasts in tone, as the-two
wives (numbers five and six)
were quite defferent.

Wakeman" used quite a variety
of instruments for this LP, all of
which he played himself: two
Mellotron 400-D’s (the super-du-
per biggies), two Mini—Moog Syn-
thesizers, an RMI electric piano
and harpsichord, a custom-built
Hammond C-3 organ (again, the
biggest model), a S.teinway grand.

‘ they weren’t used merely for the

sake of using as many instru-
ments as possible. Each has its
place, and they’re all blended
into a magnificent ensemble.

His classical influences are evi-
dent throughout the album, but
there is not the outright plagar-
ism that characterizes Keith
Emerson’s. “improvisations.”
Nor does Wakeman sacrifice pro-
fessionalism for show.

His coolness and creativity
come through in each track. and
it’s easy to imagine these in con-
cert—sounding like music and not
bases for show-off-ism-

In short, this is one album def-
initely worth its price—the in-
dividuality, creativity, musician-
ship, and quality of the composi-
tions and their execution make it
one of the best albums to appear
in the last five years.

play is a conglomeration of tech-
niques. This detracts somewhat
from a story which could have
been quite valid had it been pre-
sented in any of the styles that
it contains.

In other words. it could have
worked as a straight drama. Or
perhaps a totally absurd version
could have made it. But. as it
stands. the ideas tend to get lost
in the sauce.

Also, Rabe does not attack the
evils that he wishes to expose
with a whole lot of subtly. The is-
sues of war, racism, religious
hypocracy and the American fam-
ily scene in general could and
have had entire plays devoted to
a single one.

By trying to cover all of these
things at once the points have to
be made flatly. So, the viewer gets
the idea that he has been hit over
the head with the playwrights
message. It also makes for a play

which just runs too long.

including Majestic Prince. Can-C
onnaro II, Tim Tam. and North-

ern Dancer.

"Well. if any horse has run a
better-mile—and—a—half I‘ve nev-
er seen it," declared Lauren.
"This is the greatest horse I've
ever seen.“ '

It was Secretariat’s 13th victory
in 15 tries, and the $90,120 purse .
raised his lifetime earnings to
$895,242. '

The victory for Mrs. Penny Twee-
dy, who has "syndicated Secre-
tariat for 6,000,000 dollars. gives
Meadow Stables five of the six
big thoroughbred races in two
years. Only last year‘s Preakness
eludedxher. as Riva Ridge was
just not good in the sloppy track
in Baltimore that day. Secretar-
iat was a good "mudder”. and as
one scribe put it, Secretariat
could have won the Belmont on
roller skates.

, A crowd of 69,138, second larg-
est ever, cheered madly as Sec-
retariat poured it on, and gave
the Meadow Stable crew a long
standing ovation.

Secretariat does not go into
breeding until November 15, and
is expected to race several times
before then, hoping to surpass
the million dollar mark in earn-
ings. His next race will probably
be the Travers Stakes, a handi-
cap, at Saratoga, N.Y., in August. -

Another race of interest to
weekday is the Washington Inter-
national, run in early November. 4
This race would pit Secretariat
up against the top turf horses of
the world.

"The grass would have to be
firm and Secretariat would have

’ to be fit,” said Tweedy. "It would

mean testing him on the grass
at some time, of course. Run-
ning in the International would
be a great honor.”

The Belmont win probably
clinched Secretariat’s second
straight horse-of-the-year award.
Many observers believed that

Secreatariat would have trouble

AP—It wasn’t a race, it was a

a hero. They wanted something
bigger than life. And they got
it.

In a time when stone too of-

"I run best when I'm out there

afternoon he became‘a legend.
Secretariat’s 31-length victory in
the Belmont Stake_s, making him
the first horse in 25 years to win
the Triple Crown, was a lot
more than just an important
horse race.

This‘ colt caught the fancy .of
the American people in one of
those . rare waves of hysteria
that Europeans find difficult to
understand. His soulful eyes gaz-
ed from the covers of national
magazines. Television treated
him almost reverently.

And very few of the crowd of
68,138 who suffered at Belmont
in 90-degree heat Saturday were
anything but Secretariat freaks.

They cheered him when he
came onto the track, when he
paraded to the post. But when
he came down that stretch in
an extra-terrestrial display of
strength, they surged toward

‘the rail. and they roared for a

dream, a legend.

Many of them went away with
a little piece of history—a mutuel
ticket that said "Belmont Park 2
Race 8 June 9, 1973 WIN 2."

Secretariat was the No. 2
horse, and thousands of those
tickets weren’t cashed.

The ppst-race interviews tax-
ed the vocabularies of those who
talked about the horse. Superla-
tives weren’t enough. What words
could they use that would really
articulate what they felt?

‘It wasn’t just that Secretariat
won-it was the way he did it-
in a world-beating fashion that
made one wonder what really was
in his head.. And all of this with-
out being pushed by other horses
or touched by Ron Turcotte's
whip.

One writer. said: "God. .1 wish
that horse could talk.

Secretariat can race for Meadow
Stable until Nov. 15 and then,

if he passes a fertility test, will '

be retired to stud under control
of the syndicate.
"We would like to race him as

a 4-year-old,” said Helen Tweedy, .

operator of Meadow Stable. "But
we can’t because of the agree-
ment. So there’s no use feeling
sad about it.”

No matter what Secretariat does
next, the strapping chestnut son
of Bold Ruler has joined the
sport’s immortals and the three
gems of his Triple Crown are
among the most brilliant in the
history of the American turf. -

—The fastest Kentucky Derby
in history, 14:59 2-5 for the 11/4
miles, with a drive that began
five-eighths of a mile from the
finish. _

——A Preakness triumph marked
by a surge that carried him from
last place going into the-first
turn into the lead coming out of
it, and by a 1:54 2-5 clocking, se-

classic.

ing caught in 1:59 flat for 11/4 .

also was a Belmont record. The

-old mark was six lengths set b_v

Count Fleet 30 years ago.

, Bart Mack to stop a constant bar-

season.

The Panthers came out flying
in the first period. putting the
pressure on their opponents de-
fense. When Frank's Lunch did
get an opportunity to break out
of their town zone. they were
stopped easily by the Panther de-
fense. Consequently. the Panthers
got a lucky break which gave
them a 1-0 lead when Tom Lang‘s
centering pass deflected off a de-
fensemans skate and past goalie
Clarke.

The Panther defense continued
to play a tough game throughout
most of the first period. Defense- _
men Kerry Browne and Gary
Cummings combined with goalie

rage from the Frank’s Lunch of-
fense. Then, near the end of the
first frame, Billy Glanville and
company got on the scoreboard
when Mack was screened on a
shot from Randy Legge. The puck
just slipped by on the right side
making the score 1-1 at the end
ofaperiod. —

But. the second period was a
different story. The tired Pan-
thers suffered a defensive lapse
early in the period and’ Franks
Lunch put three quick goals by
the surprised Panther. goalie.
Tom Myers, Rick Vernon. and
John Thomas each got a goal as
the score quickly jumped to 4-1.

The Panthers weren‘t'ready to
give up despite the lopsided score.
They kept skating hard for the
remainder of theperiod, again

A REGULAR WITH the Pitt Hockey Club, Denny Browne chose to play with
old linemate Bill Glanville and Frank’s Lunch instead of the Panthers.
Browne picked up a goal for his efforts last Thursday night.

playing very tight defense. Late
in the period the Panthers got
their second goal as Rick Bagin-
ski scored on a breakaway. The
little center stole the puck at the
red line and skated in alone on
Clarke putting the puck in the
lower left corner.

The next Panther goal came in
the third period as’ defenseman
John Finney skated up ice with
the puck and passed to Tom Lang
who was all alone in frontof the
Frank’s Lunch goal. He flipped a
low shot into the net for his sec-
ond goal of the game.

But, the Panthers were not able

to get_ any closer than this as Guy
Carole and Denny Browne added
two more goals to make the score
6-3. Mack, who finished the game
with 44 saves. stopped the po-
tent Frank’s Lunch offense for
the rest of the period, but the
Panthers were too worn out to put
much pressure on their opponents.

The loss brings the Panthers
record to’5-3, keeping them in a
tie for second place. They will be
in action again tomorrow night at
the Alpine as they play the War-
riors in a 10 p.m. contest. The
Panthers have defeated this team
already this season by a score of
8-1.
