Mardi Gras

You, you, and you are invited
to the 1946 Spring Festival by
Herky Knell, president of Stu-
dent Congress; Alice ‘Soﬁs, ﬁnan-
cial co-ordinator; and Bicky Feld-
man, general chairman of Spring
Festival. And it’s you, you, and
you who will make Spring Festival
the biggest success Pitt has seen
for years.

“The chairmen of the individual
events have been working hard
and they’ve done a terriﬁc job.
Now it’s up to the student to put

‘the spring in the festival,” said

Chairman Feldman in her best
New Jersey a-ccent.

The theme of the festival is New
Orleans Mardi Gras. In the best
Southern style, there will be a
Mardi Gras ‘parade, a -carnival,
and a big ball to end the festivi-
ties. Traditional Pitt Spring Fes-
tival events include an address
by the Chancellor, Tap Day cere-
monies, a ﬂoat parade, sweepstakes
and a track meet.

“We have tried to keep the
prices of all events down to the
minimum,” said Alice Soﬁs. Then
she added brightly, “So that
everyone, can come, we have made
each event stag except the Mardi
Gras -Ball.” _

Literary Forum Launches

New Major In Writing

“The writing forum on Friday will be the unoiﬁcial inauguration

. of the new writing ‘major to be given by the University next year,”
said Edwin L. Peterson, associate professor of English.

“For many

years Pitt has had a tradition of ﬁne writing and yet no particular

attention has been given it. Now the University is remedying this by

playing host to a very distinguished group of artists in the writing
‘ A

ﬁeld.”

The writing major, which will
equip the student with the cul-
tural background and technical
skills necessary for good writing,
will -be separated from the straight
English major next year. New
courses in radio, advertising, and
verse writing will be introduced
and a student magazine will be
established.

Besides these advantages, the
English department has made
other arrangements to help young
writers. Margaret Cousins, editor

T

of Good Houskeeping magazine,
will read and give her personal
judgment of any manuscript which
the department submits to her.
Doubleday and company will con-
sider 30 student manuscripts and
award $200 to the author of the
best one. Kenneth McCormick,
editor-in-chief of Doubleday and
company who made the arrange-
ments with the University for this
award will be one of the guests at
the forum.

Elections on campus are once more the leading subject for
conversation. In the Tuck shop, in the Commons room, and
almost any other secluded corner around the campus, you see
small, intimate groups discussing the latest list of nominees an-

nounced. This is a. normal reaction; even the political move-
ments devised at these meetings are natural outcomes of the

Claire Lebovitz, Betty Linden, Dolores Keisler, Lee K2113:-ii‘;

competition among various ‘individuals and organizations on

campus. But itiis questionable whether the politics that enter
into the election proceedings are for the best or not.

We are not disputing the right of any individual to stand
for a candidate that he feels is capable of assuming a respon-
sible position with for instance, the Student Congress, and also,
to encourage his friends to back this candidate. All well and
good. .

However, the point is that when students back a candidate
merely for personal, selﬁsh reasons, without taking into con-
sideration such qualities as character, their scholastic standing,
leadership, and personality, they are actually retarding stu-
dent progress at the University.

For an example, let us go over the purpose of Student Con-
gress as taken from the Vade Mecum and:Compass: “The pur-
pose of this organization shall be‘ to coordinate student govern-
ment for women and student government for men into a uniﬁed
whole; to initia.te and carry out programs of work which pro-
mote the best interests of men and women students in their joint
relations; to create student opinion sympathetic with the Uni-
versity ideal; to provide a medium for the expression of that
student opinion. to foster loyalty to the University; and to en-
rich the opportunities for fellowship between students and mem-
bers of the faculty and administration.”

If then, we elect to ofﬁce students who are easily inﬂuenced
by “fast talkers” and are persuaded to change their opinions
to “go along with the rest of the boys” forithe sake of putting
across a political deal, and if we elect to office a person who
lacks the interest in the organization and only wants to be con-
nected with it for the name of an activity to appear beside his
name in the yearbook, we can not criticize any organization for
not fulﬁlling its purpose. We need not complain about “stu-
dent spirit” because we’ll never have any as long as we have
no leaders to inspire us. And in general as a student body we
can expect no changes that will beneﬁt us as a whole.

Some will say this editorial-is just the usual pep-talk be-
fore election which says the same old things over and over.
Maybe so, yet as long as there is a need to direct and stimulate
electing there will be editorials written. Until, on this campus,
there are open campaigning and political contests sponsored,
there will always be the necessity to advise and urge students
to do their own thinking and to do it intelligently and ob-
jectively. ‘

Thus, the main issue involved is that you go to the polls
and_.vote today. Vote for the man you honestly believe deserv-
ing of a vote and do not let yourself be outwitted into any col-

7”/14 /Val‘ ea-me?

Students who pride themselves on maintaining a vital in-
terest in world problems will be interested in attending an
assembly which wil be addressed in Foster memorial on Mon-
day at 10:45 o’clock by Dr. Ben M. Cherrington, special con-
sultant of the Department of State, VVashington, D. C.

Dr. Cherrington will speak on the United Nations Educa-
tion, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Organization, which he served as
American representative at the London conference. His talk
will emphasize the part universities can play in the UNESCO.
With the world in its present state of chaos and disorder, col-
lege students should acquire some comprehension of the active
role education can play in international ‘rehabilitation. Dr.
Cherrington’s talk, based on his broad background in the ﬁeld
of education, his experience in the conduct of international re-
lations, and his work with UNESCO, will give the student a
comprehensive picture of the world today from the standpoint
of education.

An anthem inspired by one of
the windows in Heinz Chapel will
be featured at a special song
service this Friday, in Heinz
Chapel at one o’clock. The anthem,
“Hope,” was written by Theodore
M. Finney, professor of music ap-
preciation. Doris Jack wrote the
lyrics for the anthem.

The Hope window is above and
to the right of the alter. Its color
is green, the traditional shade for
hope. The Hope window is one of
three; the left window symbo-
lizes faith and is white; the mid-
dle window stands for love or
charity and is red, the tradiion-
al color for love.

Friday’s service will be com-

ed by the students. Jean Mueller

The service will conclude at 1:25

it will be spiced with side shows,

nothing missing and nothing in-

Confucius Say: °°Take~In

Vet’s Review May 9-10”

Confucius say: “He who does

not come to see the Vet’s Review

to be presented on the evenings of May 9 and 10 at 8:15 in Foster

memorial, is deﬁnitely a square in
Right you are, old man! And

the social circle.”
may we add that if there is such

a character running loose, (and we doubt that there is) he is also
an icky and a droop and deserves no better a fate than to be stoned

to death, with paper wads, that is.

You don't have to be a Confu-9
cius to know that the Vet’s re-
view will be the funniest, most
hilarious extravaganza to grace
these hallowed halls, in many a
moon. But you’ll never have again
a Chinaman’s chance of having so
much fun for so little cost. Hustle
right down to the ground floor
and make with the long green for
a couple of tickets!

Confucius also say, “Gather all
your ears and listen to wha-t’s in
store.” First of all, the orchestra
will open the show with “We’re
in the Army Now.” The back-
ground for the ﬁrst act includes
Winter Wonderland, I Love Life,
There’s a Great Day Comm’ Man-
am-ia, and a group of service songs.
The solo on One Alone from Sig-
mund Romberg’s Desert Song will
be sung by Rick Hu.hn with Henry
Bloom at the piano.

The Night Club Sequence open-
ing -the second act features three
Jerome Kern numbers degenerat-
ing into St. Louis Blues and Hey
Ba-ba-7°e—bop. The Grand Finale
for the show will be the Ballad

for Americans sung by the chorus,
orchestra, and baritone soloist,
Harry Herlinger.

The directors of the Vets re-
view are Len Fried, fresh from
the cast of “This Is The Army”
and Stewart Workmaster. The
music for‘ the show is being di-
rected by" Joe Dym. Advisors are
R. L. Arthur, Theodore M. Finney
and Mac_*Shapiro.

And that’s not all. The Vets have
loads of novelty numbers such as
singing and dancing, chorus girls,
jugglers and hot—pian-o artists who
are strictly on the solid side and

guaranteed to make you glad you
didn’t sta"y home and knit. So
come on all you guys and gals.
Why be a square? Tickets are now
on sale, 60 cents (small change,
that is) Hurry, there’re goin’ fast!
(Ed Nbte: By the way, any
musicians who are interested in
playing with the orchestra may
apply in the Vet’s office on the
eighth floor of the Cathedral.
Show time is not far off and re-
hearsals are now going on.)

Ed Kowlaszyk and Irv Terrier

Vet Sketches

By Joy Gluck

Irv Terner and Ed Kowlaszyk
met on the ship on the way back
to the Staes and spent 14 days of

sea sickness together. But they
had more than sea sickness in
common. Both -boys had attended
Universities in England under the
Army edu-caion plan. Irv was. en-
rolled in the University of South
Wales and Monmouthshire and Ed
was enrolled at Jesus college, Ox-
ford.

Comparing‘ notes they found
that they -both enjoyed the experi-
ence _very much. Ed mentioned
the teas with the girls’ schools,
and the valet service. Irv remem-
bered, with a sigh, the breakfasts
they served him in bed at Wales.
tea first thing in the
morn.ing,” he said.

At O;:l'ord, Ed studied politics
and English government. In con-
nection with his studies he made
ﬁeld trips to Parliament in Lon-
don where he once heard a very
interesting debate on the Amer-
1132111 loan to Britain.

Irv, who was a liberal arts stu-
dent, said the students at’Wales
laughed when they heard that he
was actually a pre-medical stu-
dent ts-iking liberal arts. There
they specialized immediately in
medical studies. “English educa-
tion is a highly specialized pro-
position,” Irv said.

Ed was at "Oxford when Gen-
—tral Eisenhower went up to get an
honorary degree. “ ke got a great
ovation; he was a favorite with
Oxford graduates and faculty,” Ed
recalls. On that day Ed and Sam
Brown, a Stars and Stripes re-
pozzter, spent some time with Eis-

enhower getting a story. Ed said
that “Ike” was very proud of “hisl
boys" going to Oxford because

he felt they were furthering An-
glo-American relations.

Irv ha-d a somewhat similar ex-
perience when the King and
Queen visited Cardiff to honor the
war dead and pay tribute to the
wounded survivors. Irv was able to
take pictures of them when they
went to the University t-o con-
gratulate the chancellor, Lord
Rees. “By the way,” Irv said, “did
you know that most Welshmen
know about Pittsburgh, because
m-ost of them have relatives here?”
Even though they were used to
‘hearing about Pittsburgh, they al-
most fainted when Irv told them
the Cathedral of Learning had 42
stories.

Both agreed that the ﬁnest part
of the day was at four o’clock
when everything stopped for tea.
The rations, however, were poor
in England after the war so that
they got only 30 cents Worth of
Spam a week. Irv said he was
sure that the only vegetable in
England was brussels sprouts.

In spite of the brussel sprouts
both boys agreed that the Army’s
plan for the GI’s education was
one of the best things that could
have happened for better under-
standing between England and
America. The average British sub-
ject, they said, was amazed that
the United States government
spent so much money just to get
boys into colleges.” Everybody
liked the Yanks,” Ed said and Irv
put in ‘.‘All but the girls at Car-
diff.” “By the way,” Irv reminded
us, “-Ed got a sheepskin at Ox-
ford.’-’ Now that he is a member
ofithe college he will be a mem-
ber for the rest of his life, in fact
he can register his children at Ox-
ford as soon as they are born.

son, this afternoon at 2:30 o’cl

ock, on the Pitt tennis courts

against” Carnegie Tech. Theteam was scheduled to open the
past Saturday at Wheeling, VV. Va., against Ohio State, but wet

grounds» forced the match to‘-be¢ .

postponed. Both schools" are anxi-
-ous to play, and therefore a match
at a later date may be arranged.
Not much is known about the
strength of either Pitt or lTe‘ch;3 -

schools’f'"Pitt is a decided ‘favorite
to win because of a galaxy of dis-
trict stars.

Dr. Dave O’Laughlin, coach of
the Panthers, has had several
weeks to look his players over,
and now is fairly certain of his
starting lin-e-up. Jack Southworth,
Paul Steele, Chuck Roberts, Bobby
Bald, Jack O'Brien, Ed Louth, and
Art H-armuth will be used in the
singles, and as doubles’ entries,

O’Lau~ghlin has chosen three pairs:
Southworth an-d Bald, Steele and
Roberts, and Jack Clinton and
Harry Gillespie.

The poor weather recently has
kept the boys from practicing as
much as they desire, but they feel
that they will give a good account
of themselves this year. Although
they ar-e not under-estimating
Tech, the Pitt players are relieved

because they will not have to

tackle Ohio State ﬁrst.

Two tennis matches with West
Virginia have been dropped at the
request of the Mountaineers. This
leaves the Pitt team with only 6
more games.

Local Track Team In
Triangular Meet Sat.

by Al Roth

Coa-ch Carl Olson will reassem-
ble his roving track forces this
Saturday afternoon when the Pan-
thers take their ﬁrst severe test
of the young season in a triangu-
lar bazaar with Penn» State and
Maryland at State College.

_ Last weekend found the Pitt
thinclads moving in a two pronged
attack as part of the squad accom-
panied Olson to the Penn Relays
in Philadelphia while the remain-
der battled Carnegie Tech and the
weather for a 69% to 561/; tri-
umph.

Aces Herb Douglas, Clarence
Doak, Johnny Ulam, Ed Sudzina,
and Gene I-Ieide tried their luck in
the 52 annual running of the Phil-
adelphia ffair. However not even
ﬁve aces were sufficient to sweep
away‘ any ﬁrst in the meet as the
Pi-ttmen ﬁnished third in the half-
mile ‘relay and Herb Douglas was
surprised in the broad jump. Navy
captured the one-half mile chase
with Army, second; and Pitt, third.
The Panthers led ‘through the ﬁrst
quarter after Doak reeled off a :49
second, quarter but the Blue and
Gold were unable to maintain the
lightening like pace. Fred John-
son of Camp Lejeune, N. C., leaped
23 feet 11/4 inches‘ to u-pset Doug-
lass in the long jlunp. Joh-nson’s
winning jump was over a foot less
thansthe mark setaby Douglas when
when the Panther trackster cap-
tured the IC4A indoor title earlier
this year. V _

Most interesting to the Panther

of dashman Tommy Carr, former

injury, and most recently an ap-

Henry “Clip” Clougherty

Introducing 
Junglecats »
Regular Center

A boy who came out of nowhere
last season and can be accredited
with turning last year’s—Pitt-‘Penn
State game into a ‘Panther victory
is Henry “Clipper” Clougherty.

Clougherty’s ﬁne defensive play
halted the everdriving Nittany
Lions.

Let’s take a look at the Clipper:

Here are some of his a-ch-ieve—
ments as an athlete: he was the
basketball and football ‘captain at
Swissvale high school in‘ 1938; the
only student at that school ever
to hold that honor. He played cen-
ter his ﬁrst two years” in high
school, and then switched to half
and quarter back in his last two
years. From high school he went
to St. Vincent college where he
played at quarter back for two
years. “Clipper” came to Pitt the
past fall and starred at center in
the last three games.

He served in the Marine corps
for 31/2 years, a good deal of
the time as a Sergeant. “Clip”
fought in such famous battles as
Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Tinian, and
Saipan. At Saipan he was injur-
ed beneath the right arm by a
hand grenade and when receov-
ered, obtained his discharge.

Besides his. basketball and foot-
ball positions in high school, Clip
found time to serve as president
of the Junion class.

He has been practicing with the

Snorts Editor

 

At the end of this week Wes Fesler will dismiss his group of
grid candidates and won’t be calling them back to work until ﬁve
weeks before their opening assignment against Illinois. As the
Panthers stand now they are no match for any Big Nine foe.

The group of gridders who have stayed through the six weeks
of drills‘ have learned a lot of football. You can go from one end of
the line to the other and then cover all the positions in the backﬁeld
and you will get the same answer, “I learned a lot of football, espe-
cially the ﬁner points.”

That ‘goes to prove that the Pitt Panthers aren’t lacking expert

coaching but are lacking quality, quantity, and all that goes with it,
particularly when the schedule is considered.
,3. A little article tucked away in a corner of a sport's page has
Illinois ticketed as the dark horse in the Big Nine. Buddy Young
has much to do with the rating. Not trying to be a pessimist but
unless soinething pops up from nowhere just chalk up another loss
for Pitt against a Western Conference foe. After that put a check
in the loss column for the remaining Big Nine games on the card.
You might as well put Notre Dame on the long end of the score, too.
In the remaining games—Pitt should keep the scores close and even
win three or four. -

As said before—“Don’t blame the coach for the losses.” It takes
more than coaching. '

A Rim Around Pitt Sports

Pitt athletes were kept quite busy this past weekend and it was
far from lost.

 Carl Olson took his tracksters down to Philadelphia for the Penn
Relays. The cold damp weather didn't agree with the Panther thin-
clads nor many other of the participating athletes. The most Douglas
could do was take a second in the broad jump and the relay team
took a third in the half mile. Clarence Doak, another Pitt hopeful
whose specialty is the low hurdles, was withdrawn from the event
by Coach Olson who felt he wouldn’t be rested for the relays.

On Saturday afternoon, before an estimated crowd of 35 spec-
tators, the Pitt Nine came through with their ﬁrst win of the infant
seasonwby defeating Juniata 6 to 3. Despite the decided victory, the
Panthers are still a no hitting ball club. Fielding honors in the home
debut goes to John Connelly who shut off a Salem rally with two
diving shoe string catches.

' 9 If Carl Olson hadn’t left Tommy Carr back in Pittsburgh for
the Pitt-Carnegie Tech track meet the Panthers might have lost to
the Tartans. Instead Pitt went on to win which more or less ended a
highly ‘successful weekend.

A Report From Over There
A boy that Dr. Carlson could really use when next season rolls
around is Dodo Canterna.
' Dodo keeps us posted on his whereabouts and just how he is
doing, The latest report has the former Pitt ﬂoor star on the ﬁrst
team of the All ETO basketball team and also chosen as the Most

‘Valuable player in the USAFE.

<‘ Now you know why the doctor has a spot for him on his team.

‘One of the ball players whom Canterna played against is Sam Trom-

betore. Trombetore tied Mikan's scoring record in ’43 while playing
for Loygla University.
A couple other boys who have a name for themselves and

A gained it on the hardwood are Illinois’ Whiz Kids, Fulton and Motkr.

Quoting Canterna, “Boy, they are really a bunch of good ball
players.”

Phi Eps Take

Fraternity
Swim Meet

The annual IF swimming meet

turned into a one team exhibition
as a highly experienced Phi Ep
team went on to take ﬁve ﬁrst
places and second for an enorm-
ous total of 321/2 points.

The outcome of the meet was
never in doubt after the ﬁrst race
as the Phi Ep duo, Reel and Sut-
nick, went on to cop two ﬁrsts
each and lead their team on to vic-
tory -in' the medley relay. The
other seven entering fraternities
fought doggedly but the main
competition lie only for second
place which went to the Pi Lams.

The meet was run off in the
pool at Trees gym. The races were
run offin heats and each team was
timed individually. The scoring
had ﬁve points for ﬁrst, four
points for third, two points for
fourth, and one point for ﬁfth. In
case of a tie, the two teams split
the points b‘etween them.

The officiating was excellent and
Mr. Weeks should be high-ly prais-
ed for the ﬁne job he did in run-
ning off the races.

frost produced some harvest. As-
cord-ing to the recently-released
Poling’s Ratings, only ﬁve colleges
faced stronger opposition than
Pitt, which had a 29.1 schedule

From what we’ve seen and

fair campus seem to be doing “all
reet” with the social affairs they

have listed in their little black
books. Leading the parade of so-
cial activities are the Phi Gams

TNT

By Teddy Termite
The lawn is definitely the place

write about for May day. At this
time of year, it begins to rival
the Tuck shops as a center of not
quite extra-curricular but at least
non-intellectual activities. The ac-
cepted pose is to assume a semi-
prone position and lean slightly
backward with the mouth half
open so as to drink in literally the
full balmy content of the Pitts-
burgh zephyrs and breezes. Con-
currently, with all this, you are
making sweet talk with your cur-
rent honey to the aceomp-animent
of sweet spring sounds. For in-
stance—-the gentle lulling roar of
street car wheels interspersed into
the gleeful sh-outs of Pirate root-
ers, that is when they are gleeful,
of course. Is the lawn fun? Yeah,
it sure is from what they tell me.
Never go there myself though, too
many big ants rambling around on
the loose.
