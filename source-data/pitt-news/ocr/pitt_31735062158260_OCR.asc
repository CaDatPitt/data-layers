Honorary

Taps Four

The University's chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa has elected to mem-
bership three students from the
School of Liberal Arts; Dr. The-
odore M. Finney, head of the de-
partment of music history and
literature, was tapped as an hon-'
orary member. Initiation for the
four will be held early in Febru-

.ary.

The three students are Jay L.
Funkhouser, a chemistry major
who graduated in August, 1958;
Esther J. Mishelvich, an English
major,’ who will be‘ graduated in
June, 1959; and Carol Ann
Schmitt, a political science ma-
jor, who will graduate in Febru-
ary, 1959.

Phi Beta Kappa elects members
twice each year, usually in De-
cember and May. Only students
enrolled in the School of Liberal
Arts and ,majoring in liberal
studies are eligible. The Q.P.A. is
only one of several factors weigh-
ed in selecting members.

The rules of the chapter re-
quire that a person elected
must have had, in high school
or college or both, the equiva-
lent of the intermediate college
course in a foreign language and
two years of mathematics, in-
eludipg algebra and plane ge-
ometry. ‘

Courses considered
in character are not counted in
computing the Q.P.A., and a stu-
dent is ineligible who has accum-
ulated more than 18 such credits.
Weight is also given to the
breadth of the course programs.

Thieves sW7inning Out T

In Game 'With Police

By JOANNE DOLINAR
University police are still playing “cops and robbers"
with the thief or thieves who have been stealing articles of
clothing and school materials from the racks outside the

Schenley Cafeteria.

So far the “robbers” have been winning the game.

 Passes
New By-Laws

At an- election held last Mon-
day, undergraduate women ap-
proved the revisions in the by-
laws of AWS, which were pro-
posed by Senior Court. Major
changes, which will go into effect
next semester, are in three areas.

The Vice-president of AWS
will, in addition to acting as co-
ordinator of committees, assume
responsbilities in the area of pub-
lic relations.

The chairman of the Women's
Residence Council will be elected
by the women living on campus.
Formerly this position was an ap-
pointed office.

The third change concerns the
standing committees of AWS.
The Twelfth Floor and Cus-
toms committees were elimi-
nated. These committees will
combine in duties’ with the So-
cial. and Traditions committees
respectively.

Seni-or Court emphasized that
the combining of the Customs
with‘ the Traditions committee
does not mean that freshmen
events such as Lantern Night will
be dropped.

0.

The latest reports show that
three coats were taken from the
racks last Tuesday during the noon
hour while a student marshall was
on duty. A number of books also
have been reported missing, al-
though not through oﬂ"icial chan-
nels.

The stealing has extended to
other areas of the University. A
lunch bucket which contained,
besides a lunch the sum of ﬁve
dollars was stolen from a janitor
last VVednesday evening, out-
side a nationality rooin.

Dr. William Swartzbaugh urges
students to report any thefts to
the Student Desk in the Cathedral
or in the Student'Union. He feel:
that if all cases are reported, even
if minor, they will be of help in
tracing the criminal.

Plans were released last week
for a temporary checkroom out-
side the cafeteria. These plans
have been changed and instead,
the room next to the cafeteria, of!
the foyer, will be put to use.

This area has been used in the
past as a storage place for the
tables, chairs and other equip-
ment from the ballroom.

This checkroom will accommo-
date 200 coats. If the demand for
checking facilities increases, this
space can be expanded to accom-
modate 700 coats.

Discontent

With Food

Twenty per cent or the under-
graduate day-student population
took part in a Dining Facilities
Survey conducted in the cafeteria,
Tuck Shop, and Hunt Room in
October. Of the 1600 question-
naires distributed, 1300 were re-
turned. _

The purpose of the survey was
to determine the student opinion
of the present facilities on the
main campus area. An indepen-
dent student committee made up
of John J. Blank, Richard E.
Kleiser, and Arnold Papernick.

The greatest number of com-
plaints received were about price,
quality of food, service, and in-
The
University Food Service has been
notiﬁed of the complaints and has
planned for improvements.

It was discovered that 72 per

» cent of students with meal tick-

ets think that the quality of food
is unsatisfactory. Of the stu-
dents who pay cash, 43 per cent
complained about the food.
Almost one half of those sur-
veyed eat their lunch at the Uni-
versity, while one third eat their
dinner here. Only 20 per cent eat
breakfast at the University.
Employees are considered‘ to be
courteous by over 92 per cent of
those questioned. Most students

‘consider the.price of a meal out
‘of proportion with the prices of

restaurants in the Oakland area.

Busy Panthers Face
Exams, Five Games

Coach Bob Timmons’ hoopsters will not giveway to aca-
demics in the semester examination lull as they play ﬁve
games, two at home and three abroad, before classes resume

on Feb. 9.

The Blue and Gold journey to University Park Saturday
to play the ﬁrst game of a home-and-home series with Penn

State. The encounter will end an¢

11-day ‘layoff for the Lions who
have a record of 4-5 and will be
the Panthers’ only" game of the
week. The Lions won the Rich-
mond Invitation tournament last
month.

Geneva, on Jan. 28, and, Holy
Cross, on Feb. 6, will be met at
the Field House while the two

‘ other road games are with Duke
and Vvest Virginia. Last season
the Jungle Cats defeated" Penn

State twice, Geneva, Holy Cross,

and Duke once while losing to

the Mountaineers twice. and

Holy Cross once. I

Recently Penn State Coach
John Egli compared Lion soph
star Mark DuMars with the Pan-
thers’ All-American, Don Hen-
non: “Hennon’s a great shooter,
but I don’t think he can set you
up like DuMars. Our problem is
to get the other kids to catch his
passes. He’s so clever that I’m
afraid that they’ll get hurt.” p

Not to be outdone by Egli’s
statement, Timmons had this to
say about Hennon’s ability to
set up his teammates. “Don's
passes are so tricky that“there
are times when it looks as if we
are playing feed-in-the-face
basketbalL” '

The largest crowd of the 1958-
59 season, 5,245, saw the Panthers
lose their ninth game in 14 tries,
as they fell before Bucknell for

the second time this season, 72-58.
at the Field House last Saturday
evening. The game was the night-
cap of the Scoreboard Fund bask-
etball triple-header for Children's
Hospital. .

Trailing the favored Bucknell
ﬁve by only one point at half-
time, 32-31, the Blue and Gold
then started making their usual
mistakes that have been so costly
to them since their triumph over
Duquesne in the_Steel Bowl.

Hal Danzig and Jack Flanegan
each tallied 20' points for Buck-
nell while Harley hit for 16.
Hennon led the Panthers with 28
points. Fridley and John Mesher
were next with ten and nine
points. Danzig led the rebounders
with 22 grabs.

Gymnasts Appear

On TV Tomorrow ,

A special gymnastics program
will be presented tomorrow eve-
ning at 7 p.m. on WQED-TV. The
series of Pitt Huddle programs,
under the direction of Dr. H. C.
Carlson, willfeature the Panther
gymnasts, coached by Warren
Neiger.

Special emphasis will be placed
upon tumbling and rope climbing.
Some skills on the parallel bars
also will be displayed.

  

Gymnasts Take
Opening Match

Over Syracuse

Army, defending Eastern
champions, will try to _halt
the modest one—meet winning
streak of_ the Panther gym-
nasts when ‘they visit the

Field House Saturday night

at 8 p.m. “If everyone hits we
have a chance to beat them,”
stated Warren Neiger, the Jungle
Cats’ coach. '

By sweeping -.-the high bar, the

Skyscraper U. squad defeated
Syracuse, 571/2-37%, in a dual
meet at Syracuse last Saturday
afternoon. It was the ﬁrst meet
of the season for both teams.
John’”Marcinko led the assault
on the» high bar followed in or-
der by John Rainaldi and Dave

Hirst. Marcinko’s score was 255.‘ ‘

The Blue and Gold also cap-
tured firsts in the‘ rope climb
and ﬂying rings in downing
Coach Paul Romeo’s Orange
gymnasts.

The rope was supposed to be
the Panthers’ weakest event, but
co-captain John Cacolice surpris-
ed all observers by coming in
ﬁrst in the rather slow time of
4.5 seconds.

Hirst won the rings in a close
battle with teammate‘ Tom
Treese. Hirst registered 241
points. Paul Leveine of Syra-
cuse came in third. The Or-
ange’s Tom Bird won the tumb-
ling with a 256 ‘score followed
by Panthers’ Hirst and co-cap-
tain Don Neeld.

Leveine scored the only double
of the meet by capturing the
sidehorse and parallel bar events
with respective point totals of 224
and 249. . p

ILightwei.ghts Pave Way  
Again In 16-12 Victory 

For the third straight time Rex Peery’s lightweight mat-
men put the Panthers out in front, this time enabling them to
down Syracuse, 16-12. The undefeated Panthers now hold
a 5-0 lead in the all-time series with the Orange.

\Paul Powell, Panther NCAA Champion in the 123-lb.\

class, started the Blue and Gold rolling as he gained a 7-1 de-

cision over Neil Hayes.
Larry Lauchle outglassed George
Stephens by the same score in the
130-lb, class. ‘

The only pin 'of. the match came
when the Orange’s Les Austin
ﬂoored Sherm Moyer with a
straight front scissors and over-
head bar._ .‘.ustin?s victory in the
137-lb. class Carrie with 3:24 gone
in the match. ‘

The Panthers came right back
at the Orange as Bob Bubb de-

In the 167—lb. ﬁght Harry Pol-
lak of Syracuse was able to hold

season as he was held to a tie

In the heavyweight division
Syracuse. gridder Art Baker beat
Tom Hall, 9-3. ‘ '

The victories posted by Powell,

bled them to keep unbeaten strings
_alive. All four have won their
three season matches. Powell also
holds a varsity record of 17 wins,
one draw and no defeats.

Swimmers Finally
Defeated by Navy
After Three Wins

The mermen’s three-meet win
streak came to a harsh end Sat-
urday night as Navy swamped
them, 67-19. The Panthers had
extended their undefeated season
Friday night with a last event
46-40 victory over Lehigh.

The only winners for the Pan-
thers in the Navy loss were Bart
Haas in the 100 yard freestyle and
Howard Treser in the 440-yard
freestyle. «

It took a victory in the 400-
yard freestyle relay, the ﬁnal
event of the evening, to give the

Panthers their close win over

Lehigh at Bethlehem. Going into

that event the Panthers were he-

hind, 40-39. But Lou Durbin,

Barry Kent, Bart Ha-as and Jim
‘ Emert defeated the Lehigh quar-

tet for the win.

Sophomore Treser was a double
winner with ﬁrsts in the 220‘and

But Portfolio l5oesn’t Get Rest

‘Diplomat ’, Olson Ready to tire

Track Mentor In
Sports Since 1917

. By SALLY WERNER

Most famous world travel-
ers are diplomats. In the guise
of Secretary of State, Foreign
Secretary, or Prime Minister,
they circle the world. Little
known is that Pitt, too, boasts
of a travelling diplomat.

His portfolio: sports; his name;
Carl Olson, retiring Pitt, track
coach. ,

As a representative of the state
department in 1956, Olson visited
a number of countries. Although
he didn’t speak-their languages,
they shared a common interest—-
sports. \

At the University of New

Delhi, India, he spoke of ﬁeld

hockey; in Madrid, .all sports.

Through interpreters he spoke

in Singapore, Hong Kong, Por-
tugal and other locales. Yet “we

live in the greatest country in
the world,” he feels. ‘

The only embarrassing situation
on his tour occurred in Spain.
There oﬂicials who thought he
was travelling with his wife met
him with dozens of roses. The of-
ﬁcials, not knowing. where to put
them, deposited them in the
coach’s rooms. The odor was “un-
bearable.”

In addition to the 1956 tour, 01-
son has attended every Olympic
contest held since 1932. In 1936,
he was assistant track coach at
the competition in Adolf Hitler’s
Berlin. ‘ ‘

In 1952 he travelled to Hel-
sinki, Finland, where he wason

common ground. Thanks to a.

two-year education in Sweden.

he was able to speak Finnish,
as well as Norwegian and Dan-

Because of his frequent contact
with foreign sportsmen, the coach
has made some comparative ob-
servations on the United States.
“Here,” he stated, “there is too
much emphasis on winning. A
career of 50 per cent is good.”

This is indulgence coming from
a man whose squad won every

indoor meet last season. Under his .

guidance, P a n t h e r track-and-
ﬁelders have won 21 individual
ICAAAA championships. Three of

his runners-—John Woodruff, Herb -

Although’ an admirer of .for-
eign competitors, Olson feels
strongly regarding importe d

IS STUDYING NECESSARY?

Once there were three roommates and their names were Walter
Pellucid, Casimir Fing, and Lelloy Holocaust and they were all
taking English lit. They were all happy, lrieiidly, outgoing
types and they all smoked Philip Morris Cigarettes as you
would expect from such a gregarious trio, for Philip Morris is

, thevvery essence of sociability, the very spirit of amity, the very

soul of concord, with its toba.cco so mild and true, its packs so
soft and ﬂip"-top, its length so regular or long size. You will
find when you smoke Philip Morris that the birds sing for you
and no man’s hand is gaised against you.

Each night after dinner Walter and Casimir and LeRoy went
to their room and studied English lit. For three hours they sat
in sombre silence and pored over their books and then, squinty
and spent, they toppled onto their pallets and’ sobbed them-
selves to sleep. ’

‘ This joyless situation obtained all through September and
October. Then one November night they were all simultane-
ously struck by a ma.rvelous idea. “We afe all studying the same
thing,” they cried. “Why, then, should each of us‘study for
three hours? Why not each study for one hour? It is true we
will only learn one—third as much that way, but it does not
matter because there are three of us and next January before
the exams, we can get together and pool our knowledge!”

Oh, what rapture then fell on Walter and Casimir and LeRoyl
They ﬂung their beanies into the a.ir and danced a schottische
and litthirty or forty Philip Morrises and ran out to pursue
the pleasure _which had so long, so bitterly, been missing from
their lives. ,

Alas, they found instead a series of grisly misfortunes. Walter,
alas, went searching for love and was soon going steady with a.
coed named Invicta Breadstuii, a handsome lass, but, alas,
hopelessly addicted to bowling. Each night she bowled ﬁve
hundred lines, some nights a thousand. Poor Wa.lter’s thumb
was a shambles and his purse wasyempty, but Invicta just kept
on bowling and in the end, alas, she left VValter for a pin-"setter,
which was a terrible thing to do to \Va.lter, especially in this
case,-because the pin-setter was automatic.

Walter, of course, was far too distraught to study his English
lit, but he took some comfort from the fact that his room-
mates were studying and they would help him before the exams.
But VValter, alas, was wrong. His roonnnates, Casimir and
LeRoy, were nature loversand they used their free time to go
for long tramps in the woods. One November night, alas, ‘
they were treed by twobears, Casimir by a brown bear and
LeRoy_by a Kodiak, and they were kept in the trees until mid-
January when winter set in and the brown bear and the Kotliak
went away to hibernate. '

So when the three roommates met before exams to pool
their knowledge, they found they had none to pool! Well sir,
they had a good long laugh about that and then rushed to the
kitchen and stuck their heads in the oven. It was, however, an
electric oven and the effects were, on the whole, beneﬁcial. The
wax in their ears got melted and they acquired a healthy tan
and today they are married. to a lovely young heiress named
Ganglia Bran and live in the Canal Zone, where there are many
nice boats to wave at. ' 1; mg 34., g,,.,,,,_
