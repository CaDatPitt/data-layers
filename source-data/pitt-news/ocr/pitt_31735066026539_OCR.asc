Union troubles continue at WPIC

By Jackie Duggan

, For The PittNews

With another picketing rally planned for March 4,
negotiations between Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic workers and the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center still seem to be miles apart

District ll99P is part of the Service Employees

International Union which represents the service
and maintenance employees at WPIC. _ .
’ They have been negotiating with UPMC since
Jan. 10. Their union contract expired Feb. 3, and,
according to ll99P members, UPMC’s newcom-
ttact proposal is unacceptable.

“T hey are asking us towalk away from people
who have built the union and have devoted their
lives to WPIC,” said John Borsos, president of the
local ll99P union.

Borsos said UPMC has proposed the elimination
of the worker’s union health and pension beneﬁts.
As a replacement, UPMC will offer ll99P the
same health care benefits and pension that other
UPMC employees receive.

“If we move off our union pension fund, anyone
who is retired is cut loose,” said Borsos. “They’ll

get their pension, but it will be locked into what

they receive now.”

Local ll99P’s pension formula allows for an
increase in beneﬁts for those who are retired.

“If you retired in 1976, the cost of living goes up,
and that is what our formula takes into account,”
said Borsos. °

According to Borsos, UPMC’s pension plan does
‘not allow for a rate increase. He said the plan isn’t
bad for people who work ﬁve to 10 years, but the
majority of ll99P workers stay with WPIC for 10
to 20 years.

Sid Seligman, director of Human Resources for
UPMC, said UPMC is responding to the cost-
reduction efforts that are presently going on in the
health community. .

“We are a high-cost provider facility, and must
become competitive with other institutions in the
health care community,” said Seligman. “Our goal
is to make sure beneﬁt costs for this group [1 l99P]
is the same as other UPMC employees.”

Seligman also added that the UPMC_retirement
program is among the better retirement programs
for hospital workers in the region.

Local ll99P workers said they do not feel the
same way. .

“We ﬁgured out, based on the pension that is in
place now and the pension they are proposing,”

Professor's
suggestion
for school
is to unify

By Matt Fentress
For The Pitt News

Allegheny County’s 43
public schools could be
made more effective, equi-
table and efficient if they
were merged under a coun-
ty—wide system, according
to Pitt professor William
Cooley.

Education professor
Cooley, who serves as the
director of Pennsylvania
Educational Policy Studies
in Pitt’s Learning Research
and Development Center,
made this recommendation
in a recent paper entitled
“Restructuring Allegheny
County’s Public Schools.”
He has sent the paper to
some 300 educators and
fotmdations in the county.

To Cooley’s delight, the
paper has become some-
what of a minor media

event. “I’m in the business .

of tiying to inﬂuence educa-
tional policy,” said Cooley,
“and you can’t do that
unless you get some atten-
tion.”

Since the paper was pub-
lished in late January,
Cooley has appeared on
WTAE and 3WS radio talk
shows and a WQED televi-
sion show. He has also had
articles written about him in
numerous local newspa-
pers. ‘

Some of the major points
developed in his paper are:

°Schools would be more
effective if a clear county-
wide system of accountabil-
ity were implemented. _

°In order to develop clear
lines of accountability and
eliminate the “chain of
blame” in public schools,

Pitt Students For Life group battles against abortion

By David Palmer
For The Pitt News

At Pitt, one student organization is get-
ting involved in the issue of abortion.

According to the Students for Life
organization, it has a much different per-
spective than the average person believes.

“Our goal is to educate the Pitt campus

' about pro-life issues like abortion and

why it’s wrong,” said Sophia Kusturis, a
group member.

Students for Life has approximately 30
active members and over 200-others that
are interested in participating in the
group’s activities, according to Kusturis.

These activities range from volunteer
work at crisis pregnancy centers to pick-
eting outside local abortion clinics.

The members participate in Project
Multitude in which pro-life supporters
picket outside local abortion clinics on

— several Saturdays each month.

The members also help an organization
called Mom’s. This group provides day
care for children whose mothers go to
school during the day.

According to the Students for Life, the
group also tries to bring well-known
speakers to the Pitt campus to help edu-
cate its views.

“We try to get speakers on topics such‘

as post-abortion syndrome, the afteref-

fects of abortion _and counseling about

abortion,” said Kusturis.

The group is currently trying to sched-
ule Mary Beddingfield to speak later in
the semester about her personal experi-
ence copinggwith post-abortion syn-
drome.

Kusturis said the group’s ultimate goal
is to educate people on pro-life issues,
show why abortion is wrong, provide
worthwhile activities and show alterna-
tives to abortion.

The Students for Life will hold its first
meeting of the semester tonight at 8:30 in
room 525 of the William Pitt Union.

CHINA — The United
States and China have
signed an agreement that
will avert a pending trade
war between the two coun-
tries.

China has agreed to
respect the copyrights, trade-
marks and patents on music,
software, films and other
intellectual property that
enter China’s market from
the United States.

Both sides view
changes in China’s policy as
encouraging and as a posi-
tive turning point in the rela-
tionship between the United
States and China.

China closed two of its
biggest manufacturing plants
which were known for copy-

MOSCOW — Russia
announced that it will dis-

World War II by Soviet
troops in Germany.

Many of the works to be

taken when Russian troops
occupied Germany in 1941
and have been kept hidden
for over 50 years.

German officials are upset

that Russian troops stole

Both sides are discussing
the return of some of the

WASHINGTON —
Republican Gov. Lamar
Alexander will be the second
person to throw his hat in
the ring as a candidate for
president in the 1996 elec-
tion.

Alexander, who is gover-

nor of Tennessee, is running

on a conservative platform‘

which includes scaling back
the government’s involve-
ment in states’ activities, as
well as cutting taxes and
government spending.

Alexander also said he
would close the Education
Department, let individual
states manage their welfare
programs and would close
Congress for six months dur-
ing the year. — Reuters

WASHINGTON — This
week, the Senate will vote
on the balanced budget
amendment, which would
require the federal budget to
be balanced. '

Senate Republicans are
pushing to come up with the
needed 67 votes so that the
measure can be approved
and sent on to the states for
ratification.

The measure, which was
approved by the House earli-
er this year, is facing an
uphill battle in the Senate,
because many Senate
Democrats do not approve or
are undecided.

The measure must be
approved by two-thirds of
the Senate to be sent on to
the states for ratification.

Then 38 of the 50 states -

must approve the balanced
budget measure before it can
become a part of the
Constitution. ‘—- Reuters '

Pitt Semester ot Sect
students travel to Turkey,
Ukraine ond Morocco

(Tony F iorini is a photographer for
The Pitt News and a junior at Pitt.
This column‘ is a recollection of his
travels in the fall on Semester at
Sea. Photos also by Tony F iorini. )

ODESSA, Ukraine —— It’s me
again, back from the S.S. Universe,
this time in Odessa, Ukraine. Our
journey from Israel was interesting.
As we entered the Mediterranean
Sea, a storm broke, and we experi-
enced some of the roughest weatlr-
er yet. They even broke out the
“Please "hold on to your tray!” signs
in the cafeteria. It was an intense
three days of classes ending with a
trip through the Bosporus Strait
into the Black Sea.

When the ship clocked in the
morning, I had to be ‘ready for my
trip to Saint Petersburg. It was a
twohour plane ride that I will not
forget any time soon. The bus from
the ship drove right out onto the
runway, and we boarded the plane.
Inside, underneath a badly ﬁtted
layer of carpeting, I could see that
the ﬂoors were plywood. I had
never seen wood as a construction
material for a jet before, not to
mention the stench of fuel and the
luggage rack — the kind you
would ﬁnd on a bus above your
head for carryon bags.

All the buildings in Saint
Petersburg are massive structures,
built by the great czars of pre-
Communist Russia. They are orni-
nous and uninviting,.like nothing I
have ever seen It makes me glad
to live in Pittsburgh where the
buildings are very colorful com-
pared to them. g

I went to a circus show in Saint
Petersburg and left knowing a great
injustice is being done to the ani-
mals there. Emaciated tigers
walked slowly around the cage,
made to run by a whip when not
moving fast enough. The ring was
ﬁlthy, and I could only imagine
what the cages backstage looked
like. It made me think, “Why is
this happening?” But this is a job
for these people; it puts food on the
table, I would guess.

Saint Petersburg was cold and
dark. Being so far north, the sun
came up at 9:30 in the morning,
and set at 3:30 in the afternoon. It
was strange. Also strange for an
American was seeing every person
outside wearing a fur hat. I.fo1md
out why they were wearing them
after I bought one —- they are the

warmest things you can put on
your head. I left Saint Petersburg
feeling that I really didn’t see what
I wanted. I didn’t get to meet any
students and talk with them. Russia
is a country that requires much
more than a week for exploration.

We went back through the
Bosporus, only this time we
stopped in Istanbul, Turkey.
Istanbul is an amazing city with an
even more amazing history. The
people are friendly, almost too
friendly — everyone wants to sell
you something, usually a rug. I
must have beenasked to buy a mg
a hundred times. I would answer,
”No, I have wall-to-wall carpet-
ing.” But the Turks are very persis-
tent. “You have friend that needs
carpet?” they would ask.

The Grand Bazaar, with over
1,000 shops, is the craziest place I
know of in the world to shop. You
can buy a gold necklace and walk
next door and get a leg of lamb. -I
I Things were priced considerably
high, but the key is to bargain.
There were usually no price tags,
so you had to ask the owner how
much he wanted for whatever you
wanted to buy. Then tell him you
will give him halfof what he said.
He will laugh at you, and maybe
come down a little. This is where
the fun starts. The game could last
for as long as 45 minutes, and in
the end, after you have walked
away seven or eight times, you
should end up giving him a little

more than half of the original ask-

ing price. It was frustrating at
times, but it was nice to have that
interaction. Usually, between the
bargaining, there is some genuine
conversation.

When the seller learns you are
from America, he most often
would say, “Oooh, are you from
America?! Are you a student from
the ship? I will give you special
price for you, my American
friend.” The Universe stops there
once a year, and most of the shop
owners know about it.

Mosques, the religious buildings

of Islam, dominate the skyline. _

Each mosque has at least one
minaret, a tower from which a per-
son calls the people of the area to
prayer. A follower of Islam prays
ﬁve times a day. I went to a prayer
meeting of the Sufi-Dervish
Brotherhood, a group within Islam
that has a special way of praying.
Two busloads of Semester at Sea

students went, and when we got
there, the men were chanting. We
listened, and when there was a
break, the male students were
asked if we wanted to join in. It

was an extraordinary experience. a

As they walked around in circles,
we joined in. They showed us what
to do, how to walk and what to say.
I left Turkey with some great expe-
riences. It is a place I would like to
explore more, but so are all the
other countries on the itinerary. »

The sail to Morocco was rela-
tively uneventful, except for the
day that the Rock of Gibraltar was
in sight. I was in the middle of
class, and my professor decided to
take a 10-minute break to look at
the rock. Everyone kept saying,
“Get a piece of the rock,” and tak-
ing pictures. It was cool, but it was
a lot of commotion-over a rock

In a pre-port briefing, it was
stressed that women should travel
in groups, and when possible, with
men. I wanted to go to Manakesh,
the in-spot to go and hang out in
the hippy ‘60s. Two friends, Carly
and Sandi, and I got together and
decided to go. After a tlnee—hour
train ride we were ﬁnally there.

We found a hotel room, got a
bite to eat and wanted to explore
our new surroundings. Fenna
Square was the logical place to
start. It is a huge open square in the
middle of town where during the
day, people charm snakes, tell sto-
ries and sell snacks. At around 5
p.m., things start to change, and it

turns into a completely different
place. It becomes more crowded
and alive with the smells ‘of cook-
ing camel meat. This is the Fenna
Square we walked into, and it was
an experience. Before I knew it,
there was excitement right next to
me. A short round man ran after
some kids and was hitting them
with his keys that were on the end
of a piece of string. He then
approached me and gave me my
ship ID that the kids had stolen
from my front pocket. The man

V was nice and showed us around the
square. It was amazing that no one

would bother us when he was

-around. I didn’t like the fact that I
had to have a native with me so 1

other people would not harass me,
but that’s what had to happen.

The next day, we got a guide to
show us the bazaar, a maze of
shops where leather goods were
the best buy. I made a few purchas-
es, and, believe me, bargairringis a
must here too.

The next day, Carly, Sandi and I
explored Marrakesh on our own,
without a guide. We really didn’t
go very far —— back to the market
to make some last-minute buys —-—
and as the sun was setting we
found an old palace. It was mostly
in ruins with crumbling walls and
rotting wood, but it was calm. As

“usual, a guide was waiting to show

us around, but we declined. He
was obviously upset and couldn’t
understand why we didn’t want his
services. We had been to so many

 
   

places and been given so many
tours, we wanted to do this one on
our own. We knew we might miss
some things, but it was not really
important to us. -

As the sun was slipping down
behind the crumbling walls, I sat
down to reﬂect on what I had been
doing for the past three months. So

many things came into my head‘

that night —-— that fall day in
Vancouver when I left, my birth-
day party in the Red Sea, walking
on the Great Wall of China and
standing in front of the pyramids.
Then there were the people and the
students in almost every country ‘I
had met _

We rode the train back the next
afternoon to spend a day in
Casablanca. I went on my own to
take some pictures and walk
around the city. The next day was
the last, and the United States‘. It

was a weird day for me: I was A
happy and sad, excited and.

depressed, ready and, at the same
time, not ready. I spent as long as I
could off the ship. Standing in the
dark, on the dock, I could not

V believe this day had come to pass.

For all of you who have faithful-
ly been reading, my journey is
almost over. I have been home for
two months now, but there is one
last port to write about — Fort

-Lauderdale, Fla. There will be one

more article on the many hardships

Curb cable costs

Just in time for April Fool’s Day, TCI of Pennsylvania
will play a cruel joke on its subscribers. The company will
raise its rates, but it won’t say “April Foo1’s!” and promptly
lower them again. Instead, its customers will receive a rate
increase and one extra channel.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, there will be a
rate increase of $.96 for the city of Pittsburgh. This is above
and beyond the $1.05 increase that began this month. The
two rate hikes planned this year will raise the monthly fee
for basic service to $24.23, a 9 percent increase. The subur-
banites will also get a rate increase, but it will be less than
their city cousins; they will face increased costs of about
$.45 to $.75 a month.

The rub is that although the costs are going up, there
will not necessarily be a substantial increase in the quality
of service. But what are the people of Allegheny County to
do? TCI is the region’s largest cable company, and it holds
a virtual monopoly over the area. They do hold a monopoly
over the University of Pittsburgh itself.

Currently, the cable system is not of the highest
quality. Service varies from day-to-day, and .TCI’s
customers must pay whether they get good service or not.
If the cable goes out, they must pay the monthly flat
rate just as if the cable service was functioning properly.
Yet, if the city of Pittsburgh cuts off the water, at least
the water meter is not running. If your electricity does not
flow through the wires, the meter is not running there
either.

The city of Pittsburgh should encourage other companies
to give TCI some competition which would prevent rate
hikes. TCI says these rate hikes can be made under the
Federal Communications Commission rules that allow rate
hikes to cover outside costs. Also, with more varied service,
customers can get service which is more closely tailored to
their demands. 7 ‘

Outside of that possibility, subscribers to TCI’s service
should watch their provider like hawks to ensure that they
get what they pay for. Customers have a right to the service
they have purchased in good faith.

If the cable company’s service is substandard, then sub-
scribers should call and complain. In addition, they should

. let TCI know what they want in the way of service.

Subscribers ought not just let the company dictate what they
will receive, but should make suggestions and ask for ser-
vices such as new specialty channels and interactive ser-
vices. - ‘

Stand up and be counted. The students at this university,
both on campus and off campus, make up a noticeable part
of the subscribers for TCI. By making your views known,
you will make the company more responsive to you and its
other customers.

GOP’s Contract
With America,
the rhetoric is
/,  heating up as the
. " ' Republicans pre-
Columnist pare to debate
Tony . the most contro-
Dickensheets versial portion of
their contract.
As with the first half of the
Contract, I am a supporter of the
majority of the second—half
issues as well. But recently the
Republicans have aimed their
guns at a target that I clearly
don’t agree with. They have
introduced a bill which would
shift money that has been used
in the past to guarantee poor
children free or reduced-price
school lunches to the states.
While the Republican proposal
would not destroy the lunch pro-
grams as the Democrats have
claimed, I do question the feasi-
bility of simply giving three-
block grant to the states as a way
of funding them. A
There are currently 14 million
low-income children throughout
the country who receive free or
reduced-price lunches, in addi-
tion to more than six million
mothers and children who sup-
plement their diet through the
WIC program. What some
Republicans have yet to
acknowledge is that these pro-
grams-are NOT the sort of wel-

fare programs which continue to,

pay young girls to have children
or that allow healthy, able adults
to simply stay at home and wait
for a government handout every
month while not working for
years. Children do not qualify to,
as Senator Phil Gramm says,
“help us pull the wagon.” We
must understand that many of
these children do not live in wel-
fare families. As a student in the
public school system I received
reduced-price lunches for years,
and my father always had a full-

time job in addition to at least
one part-time job. Giving chil-
dren a healthy lunch is not about
“personal responsibility” as
some in the GOP have wrongly
asserted. I’m all in favor of elim-
inating welfare, but let’s not mis-
takenly include this program
with those others, because there
are no similarities. A clear dis-
tinction must be made between
these programs and welfare
reform. Even the Republicans

‘ have acknowledged this fact, or

they wouldn’t be advocating‘ giv-

ing states money to support it.

Under the Republican pro-
gram, states would still have to
spend a full 80 percent of the
block grant money on subsidiz-
ing the school lunches for chil-

dren. This is a requirement on .

the states, not a choice as
President Clinton has claimed.
What I am mostly" concerned
about is that some children
won’t get fed, and that some

' states, in an attempt to save

money, will not ensure that
schools have adequate nutrition-
al standards. This is absolutely
essential if we are to expect chil-
dren to be able to receive an ade-
quate education, since it is a sci-
entifrc fact that the health of chil-
dren and their ability to learn are
inextricably linked. Not only do
good nutritional programs help
children learn better, but they
also will cutdown on health care
costs and help to create a more
qualiﬁed work force.

The reason that the
Republicans have stated for
introducing this legislation is to
cut the bureaucracy. While there
is nobody more in favor of cut-
ting the bureaucracy than me, I
am also absolutely convinced
that there are certain programs
and responsibilities that must
remain in the control of the fed-
eral government. The standard
measuring rod‘ that. the
Republicans use is if it is in the
national interest than the federal

not a welfare program

The problem is that many of
them seem to believe that only
the military has a direct link with
our national security. I would
argue that as technology contin-
ues to advance and the need for a
highly educated populace
becomes more urgent, that being
a technological superpower will
be every bit as important as hav-

ing a strong military. In fact, in

the future the educational quality
of those in our military will have
to increase as well. Otherwise,
there will be a threat not only to
America’s economic superiority,
but to our military’s as well.

Our education system is
already inferior to most other
industrialized nations and it
won’t help if many of our chil-
dren are inadequately fed, mak-
ing them unable to concentrate
on their studies. Speaker
Gingrich knows the importance

of an educated populace in the .

coming post-industrial, techno-
logical age and he would be wise
to see that our government edu-
cates as many of its citizens as
possible. Otherwise, in the near
future, this country will not only
have increased racial strife, but a
very serious conflict between
those that have an education and
find good jobs, and those that
don’t.

I believe that the federal gov-
ernment can allow the local gov-
ernments to have some ﬂexibili-
ty in education and the school
lunch programs, but not without

any supervision.'If the federal I

government gives states an unsu-
pervised blank check, I have no
doubt that the first program that
will be cut in times of fiscal trou-
ble will be children’s school
lunches. This will happen
whether the politician is a
Republican OR a Democrat
because children can’t vote, and
they don’t contribute to re-elec-
tion campaigns.

Antigua’s ~

Columnist Ceremony
Sean before the
Duncan start Of the
Providence
game Saturday, it was tough for
the man who bleeds blue and
gold to hold back.
“I was trying to think about

the game plan, so I wouldn’t
look at my mom or any of the
other mothers tearing up,”
Antigua said. “I saw Jaime’s
[Peterson] mother tearing up.
Then I saw my mother tearing
up and I said, ‘Aww.’ Then the
tears came down.”

The emotion displayed by
Antigua, and the other two
seniors, Peterson and Chris
Gant, who were honored at their
last game at the Fitzgerald Field
House, is indicative of the entire
1994-95 Pitt season. It is indica-
tive ofa team that lacks the all-
around ability that most teams
have, but makes it up with heart
and emotion.

And the seniors deﬁnitely
went out with a bang. The trio
combined for 35 of the Panthers’-
56 points and added 28
rebounds, lifting Pitt past a
pesky Friar squad, 56-48.

Each senior contributed in dif-
ferent ways to the outcome,
which culminated a rocky 8-16
season.

Gant stood in the spotlight
with his career-high 21 points
and grabbed 14 rebounds.
Behind him was Antigua, who
punched in 10 points, four
rebounds and four assists. But
more importantly, he left his
heart and guts laying center
court right next to Pitt’s new
panther emblem, the same
emblem he appropriately has tat-
tooed on his arm. Antigua’s
gutty hustle and emotion are
some things he has shown every
game in his four—year career at
Pitt. V

Then there was Peterson —
the crowd favorite, the dark
horse and Pitt’s linchpin.
Unfortunately for Peterson, his
four points weren’t representa-
tive of his season — a season
that saw a rail—thin 6-foot-9 cen-

‘ ter step out of last year’s mini-

mal playing time and Eric
Mobley’s shadow to practically
dominate the Big East.

Peterson, whom many are
calling the most improved player
in the country, was among the
top 10 in six conference cate-
gories, including first in blocks.
And before teams started keying
on Peterson, he led in free throw
percentage, ﬁeld goal percentage
and rebounds, to go along with

Pitt’s Orlando Antigua
glided across the lane and
threw down a monster slam
just before the first-half
buzzer sounded. When he
landed, Antigua stood
motionless, staring at the
crowd with a slight smirk
like he knew there was more
to come in the second half.

Antigua’s look didn’t lie.
Pitt piled it on Providence
in the first five minutes of

the second
half and

back, as
Pitt won its
third Big
East game in four tries, beat-
ing the Friars 56-48
Saturday afternoon at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

“We won the game today,
and obviously it wasn’t pret-
ty,” Pitt coach Ralph Willard
said.

“We haven’t played too
much pretty basketball all
year, and again, what we
won was with heart and soul
and effort, and that’s a trib-
ute to those three kids.” .

The kids Willard was
referring to were the three
seniors, Antigua, Chris Gant
and Jaime Peterson, who
played their last game at the
Field House.

The seniors led the way
for the Panthers, making

their last home game a mem-
orable one.

Gant paved the way with a
career and game-high 21
points and nabbed 14 boards.
Antigua finished with 10
points, and Peterson grabbed
10 rebounds but scored only
four points, 10 below his
average.

“I told Jaime and Orlando
of course it’s going to be
emotional in the beginning,
but just stick through it and
try to stay focused on the
game,” Gant said, “because

that’s what we were trying to

do was to come out with a
victory. If we would of lost,
our last game would have
defeated the purpose.”

Whether there was a lot of
emotion or not, neither team
could shoot straight. Pitt
shot 35 percent for the game,
while Providence shot a
skimpy 31.4 percent.

One of the main reasons
for the Friars’ ineptness to
score was that Pitt bottled up
the Friars main-gun Eric
Williams. Williams, a 6-
foot-8 forward, who came
into the game averaging 19.3
points, scored only five,
while only connecting on
one shot for the game.

“Eric Williams, our top
player, didn’t have his usual
good game,” Friar coach
Pete Gillen said. “So when
he has an off-game, like all
players do, it’s tough for us
to be real competitive.”

Williams scored 27 points

Miami nabs title from men ’s swim

By Jim Wheeler
For The Pitt News

Before the men’s swim-
ming and diving team
stepped into Trees Pool this
weekend, they had won the
Big East Championship 11
out of the past 12 years. Last

night the record fell to 11 for

13.

The Panthers finished third
with a total score of 675.
Miami won the title with
679.5 and Syracuse took sec-
ond with 675.5.

Behind Pitt was Villanova
(502), Connecticut (330.5),
St. John’s (196), Providence
(172), Seton Hall (153.5),
Boston College (145) and
Georgetown (102).

All coach Chuck Knoles
could do was smile, knowing
that him and his team would
haveto wait until next year
to get their revenge.

“I was really proud of the
guys,” Knoles saidi “I think
had everything gone as was
planned, if it weren’t for one
disqualification, we would
have been repeat champions.
I’m really proud of these
young men, proud of their
accomplishments. I think
that what they did tonight is

 

a phenomenal comeback
with very adverse circum-
stances.

“They didn’t stop, they just
kept pounding event after
event to come on back and
get back into the meet. I
think it*was kind of shocking
to everybody. They deserved
to be the swimmers of the
meet; they really did because
I was extremely proud of
them.”

A crucial false start on
Saturday made Pitt chase
Miami throughout the finals
last night.

women’s swim team wrote the
final chapter of their 1995
story in dramatic fashion
Sunday night at Trees Pool.
The overachieving team came
14 and a half points from win-
ning the Big East
Championship. V

The meet was decided on by
the final race as Pitt, along
with eventual winner
Villanova and second place
finisher Miami, swam the 400-
yard freestyle medley. The
final score for the three-day
meet was Villanova with 595
points, then Miami with 583,
followed by the Panthers, who
amassed 580.5 points. The vic-
tory also gave Villanova its
fourth straight Big East
Championship.

meet was going to be tough,”

Lady Panthers sink Villanova, 49-44.

By Michael Kovak
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panthers
ended their regular season
with three straight wins after
they defeated Villanova 49-44
Saturday night at the Field
House.

It was senior night for co-

c a p t a i n s

C a r o 1

Morton and

J c n i n e
Joyce,and
both play-
ers_ were
instrumen-
tal down
. the stretch.

“J enine and Carol did a fan-
tastic job tonight,” head coach
Kirk Bruce said.

The Lady Panthers trailed
40.-39 with 4:18 left in the
game when Joyce drained two
foul shots to give Pitt a 41-40
lead. After a block by center
Latia Howard, Morton made a
jumper to give Pitt a 43-40
lead.

Villanova would not go
away, though.

Two straight buckets by the
Lady Wildcats gave ‘Nova a
44-43 lead with just 1:45

remaining.

With 1:20 remaining,
Howard rebounded a missed
jump shot, scored and was
fouled. =

“That was the biggest buck-
et of my career at Pitt,”
Howard said. .

After Howard’s bucket,
Bruce called a time-out before
Howard’s foul shot.

“I wasn’t trying‘ to ice my
own player,” Bruce said. “I
thought it was more important
for the team to know what to
do if Latia missed the foul
shot.”

Howard did not miss the
foul shot, and the freshman
gave Pitt the lead for good at
46-44. _

“We really wanted this

. game,” Howard said. “Last

year ‘Nova knocked us out of
the NCAAs. This was kind of
’ a payback.”

Morton then iced the victo-
ry with the final three points,
two coming on a layup assist-
ed by Joyce.

The pace of the first half
was not as fast and furious as
the second.

Guard Stephanie Petho
finally got the Lady Panthers
on the board 3:45 into the

game with a jumper that knot-
ted the score at two.

Over the next five minutes,
Pitt went on an 11-4 run to
open up a 13-6 lead. Pitt
never trailed the remainder of
the half, and at one point
opened up a 27-17 lead on a
reverse layup by Julie
Fornadel with 3:14 remaining
in the half.

The scoreboard at halftime
showed the Lady Panthers
leading 27-19. I _

The Lady Panther defense
held Villanova to 28 percent
shooting in.'the first half, as
only three Lady Wildcats
scored. Pitt shot 39 percent
(12-31) for the half. 9

For the game, Villanova
shot 32 percent (18-57), while
Pitt’s shooting dropped to 36
percent (19-53).

“We have not been shooting
well at all lately,” Bruce said.

Leading all scorers,
Villanova point guard
Michele Thornton scored 18
points. Only four Villanova
players scored. Lady Wildcat
center Jennifer Maga collect-
ed a game-high 12 rebounds.

Leading the point tally for
the Lady Panthers was
Morton, who was the only Pitt

player in double-figures with
12 points. Petho and Howard
each netted nine points, while
Howard also added 10 boards.
Joyce added eight points.

The victory raised the Lady
Panthers’ record to 16-10
overall, with a 10-8 confer-
ence mark. Villanova, who
had won seven straight,
dropped to 18-7 (13-4).

More importantly, the win
elevated Pitt to a fourth seed
in the upcoming Big East
Tournament starting March 3
at Seton Hall.

Pitt will play St. John’s on
Saturday March 4. The two
teams split their regular sea-
son meetings with both teams
scoring blowout victories on
their respective home courts.

“We really want St. John’s,”
Howard said. “They beat us
before, but we know that we
are better.” '

Bruce said, “We have to do
a better job defensively
against St. John’s or we might
lose to them again.”

The chances of the Lady
Panthers making the NCAA

' Tournament appear slim. The

Big East Tournament champi-
onship could be their only
shot.

Longtime Pitt
man Lewis

dies at 65

Former Pitt baseball coach
and longtime athletic depart-
ment administrator Bobby
Lewis died at his home
Wednesday following a lengthy
illness.

Lewis, 65, served in many
capacities during his 38-year
tenure at Pitt before his retire-
ment in January 1993. He was
best known for compiling a
438-389 record as Pitt’s base-
ball coach for 36 years.

“Bobby was a great man -
and a great Pitt man,” said Pitt
Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
following Lewis’ death. “He
touched many, many lives dur-
ing his long and distinguished
career at Pitt.” ,

‘When Lewis ended his base-
ball coaching duties in 1990, he
continued to serve the depart-
ment as an assistant athletic
director until his retirement.

In addition, Lewis served 10
years as program coordinator
for men’s varsity sports.

Lewis is survived by his
wife, LaVerne, and a son,
Robert Jr.

said an almost voiceless head
swimming coach Marian
Cassidy Kean. “A lot of things
can happen in a three-day
meet like this. You have to
have the ability to come back
and fight if things do not go
your way.”

The meet also marked the
first Big East Championship
competition for the freshman
on the team and the final one
for senior co—captain Vicki
Geubtner.

“The upperclassmen told us
about the intensity of the Big
East Championships, but we
really did not know what ‘to
expect,” said freshman Becca

Heyns. “It was very exciting.-

Both the men’s and woman’s
meets came to the end, and
Pitt was in the middle of it.”

“I was really happy with the
outcome of the meet,” said an
emotional Geubtner. “This
was our best finish since I
have been here. I would have
liked to win the meet, but we
came close. In my heart, Pitt
won this meet.”

Kean, along with her team’s
strong performance, walked
away with an award 'of her

‘own. The second—year coach
was voted by her peers as the
Big East Women’s Coach of
the Year.

“It is always great when you
are recognized by your peers,”
said Kean. “I think the award
is a reflection of the team’s
performance. The whole team
won the award.”

Pitt diving star and
Olympic-hopeful Sunday
Lewandowski finished off an
average Saturday for herself
by winning both the one and
three-meter competition en
route to being named the
Women’s Big East Diver of
the Year.

“I tried a new dive on the
one~meter board,” said
Lewandowski. “Fortunately, it
went well. I needed that dive
to win. If I did not land it, the
results would have been dif-
ferent. On days like these, I
am proud to be a Pittsburgh
Panther.” ’

"‘I am very pleased with our
performance this weekend,”
said diving coach Julian Krug.
“Our season is far from being
over, but with the way we per-

formed this weekend, it _ -

appears that we are on the
right track.”

his 14.8 point average.

Despite all the adversity, like
frequent injuries that limited the
Panthers with seven scholarship
players for most of the season,
the three seniors kept their heads
high, shielded off the bunches of
heart-breaking losses and kept
fighting back each game.

They’ve had to adapt to Ralph
Willard’s new system after play-
ing under Paul Evans for three
years. They were in the same
boat as the rest of theteam but
still carried the brunt of burden in
Pitt’s losing ways — and did it
admirably.

After suffering two struggling
seasons, the worst thing for the
trio is they won’t be part of the
Pitt basketball turnaround when
Willard gets his prized recruits
next season.

“Today after we won I told
coach Willard that I had an extra
year, that my brother did some
research and I had an extra year,
and he started smiling,” Peterson
joked. “But that’s part of life.”

But life isn’t always fair,
because if it was Peterson,
Antigua and Gant would have a
taste of the national limelight that
Pitt will soon embark.

But they do have the satisfac-
tion of knowing that they laid the
groundwork, put in the labor and
built the bridges for future Pitt
teams to cross.

than a second behind
Syracuse and Miami.

Even though the Panthers
didn’t walk away with the
title, they all credited their
teammates, which was the
most important thing they
knew was left.

Pete Hezky summed up
the meet best when he said,
“I think we did a great job,
we fought hard and we lost.
Who cares, we’re going to be
back next year and we’re
going to train hard.

“We’re going to go back,

going to do great because we

We’re going to train hard
