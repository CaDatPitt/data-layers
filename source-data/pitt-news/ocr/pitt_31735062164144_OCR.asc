  Freshman

Class Will

Top 1400

This year’s freshman class will
be the largest in the University’s
history. Dr. Alan C. Rankin, as-
sistant chancellor for student and
general affairs, said that 1478
freshmen have paid their deposits
for the fall term.

“Any new applicantiis being
asked to wait for January or to
consider one of the regional
campuses for September," stated
Richard D. Stephenson, assistant
director of admissions.

The’ University had been plan-
ning 'for a class of around 1350'
and feels that the present class
will just about ﬁll the existing
University facilities. ' .

S Class Full

Although the University has “all

we can handle,” Mr. Stephenson
emphasized that full consideration
and acknowledgment wil be given
to all late applications. “We want

. to, work invthe best. _il1fC§_.!,‘e_$_ts of -the”

student,” he ' said,

This year's « incoming fresh-
man class shows a reverse trend

' from the past two years. when

the -classes hovered at about
1100.

‘Director of Admissions Everard
K. Pinneo cited larger high school

graduating classes as the reason

for the increase in students.

Similar Class

Academically, Pinneo expects
the incoming class to be very sim-
ilar to last year's class, whose
average College Board scores were
545 in verbal, and 570‘ in math.

63 percent of last year’s. fresh-'
man classewere from the upper
ﬁfth, and 24 per cent were from
the second ﬁfth of their high

rrhe  

school classes.

this wish come true.

According to Miss’Andino, who

British Drama Expert

 Jamieson Explains Theater,

By BILL MAWHINNEY ,

Michael J amieson, Warden -of the Uni-
versity of Sussex, England gave what he
’ ca1led.a “rapid, glib, superﬁcial survey” of 
what is ‘going on. in the contemporary
British .theater at a Forum Series lecture

in the SU Lower-9= Lounge.

_He began his general sketch by mentioning
that last year was a good season for British plays
in New York. So many top British stage per-

“sonalities were performing in

London suffered a‘ “stars famine”.

_ He added that the British scene is dominated
byﬁthe commercial theaters in London just as ‘
New York is the center for the American stage.
Some obvious diﬁerences between the “capitals
ofthe English-speaking theater” are the higher ’
prices of tickets in New York, the .“respect you
give to your critics here in America”, and the
fact that England no longer has anything com-

parable to “Off—Broadway.”
Vital Play Groups

According to Mr. Jamieson, the most signiﬁ-
cant development in the last decade has been
the establishment of vital play—producing ,‘or-
ganizations which have‘ pumped important new‘
talent into the English stage. He speciﬁcally
talked of. the policies and activities of the

Bring, (On The   Panthers!

,By Marvin ’Brufus’ Zelkowiiz

Universities constantly need money. Tuition
doesn’t cover the cost of today’s education. The

- University is no different from any other. It’

needs money. How to get this money is a problem.
‘Each summer Pitt Stadium is empty, used for
nothing‘ except track. Yet it
This
maintenance costs money.
Pitt Stadium can solve
both problems itself. It can
-_pay for its own maintenance,
"and it can help the Univer-
’ sity solve its ﬁnancial worries.
The administrators, with the
cooperation of the Athletic De-

dium as a coliseum during the 03:: 

summer months. With a coli-

seum, the University could charge admission for
a full day’s summer fun, thereby raising some‘ of
the money it needs.

They could start with gladiatorial combats in
the morning, pitting fourth string football players
against live panthers. (We know that the Romans
used lions, but remember school spirit.)

This combat would serve several purposes.

iFirst, it would expose the substitutes to the

' rigors of battle. Coach John Michelosen would 7

no longer have to worry about inexperience- By

the time fall came around, they would be ex-

perienced veterans in combat, with the upcom-

ing football wars seeming to be a break from
their summer fun.

Second, the athletic department would be able
to cut down on the feeding bill for the football
players, most likely resulting in an admission
rate 1‘educti0n to the gladiatorial games while
still meeting expenses.

Third, the zoology department would be able
to cut down on its feeding bill for the panthers.

 

Fourth, the gladiatorial games would provide a
full morning’s entertainment for the University
student who seeks his kicks in unusual ways.-

~Fifth, the games would bring revenue to the

University. People would flock to Pitt from
the entire tri-state area to get a look at some
genuine gladiatorial combat. .

Sixth, the gladiatorial combat would keep stu-
dents from sleeping in the morning. In this way,
students would get used to getting up early, and
they would miss fewer early classes this fall.‘

The afternoon could add even more variety to

the day. Using the ﬂoor of the stadium as a base

for a lake, sea battles could be staged with the
Pershing Riﬂes manning one ship, and the Arnold
Air Society running the other.

The ships, which would of course be
triremes, could be designed by professors in the
Classics Depa.rtment'and could be built by the
carpenters in the Cathedral basement.

After the ships are assembled, the Greeks here
could paintsthem, thereby adding to the classical
atmosphere of the day .as well as giving them
practice for the ﬂoats they will have to paint
should the tradition be re-introduced into Home-
coming. -

But for a slightly different twist the stadium
could be drained in the midst of the battle,
leaving‘ the two military groups free to get some
actual practice in 0 using their knowledge of .
\ warfare. ‘

There is a shortcoming to this sea battle, how-
ever. For if Dean Helen Rush should_ happen to
watch the carpenters while they are building the
triremes, the carpenters are more likely to ready
a thousand ships for Helen, instead of -two for the
games. '

Then, after the day’s activity, in keeping with
the classical tradition already established,’ w
could have an orgy. "

facilities. Laboratory

A = ,:- adequate
 .?h’pparatus has been severely limit-
.~ .ed.. Often there is only enough
equipment for a professor to per-
form demonstrations; a student
“may never‘ get the chance to do
 experiments for himself.
' New Labs Built
‘In the fall, however, a new
chemistry lab built by Central
. . University will open, with $50,000
~ worth of equipment supplied by
the University of Pittsburgh.
$90,000 worth of civil engineering
equipment will be supplied to a
second laboratory, also opening in
the fall. In addition a new lan-
guage laboratory valued at $8,000
has just been turned over to Cen-
tral University, and a new psy-
, chology lab has just been in-
augurated. '

“These laboratories are teach-
ing instruments,” Dr. Schaeffer
stressed. He feels this is an im
portant distinction, for most
laboratories in Latin America
are only for professors.

Textbooks, too, are scarce, since
they are often costly, and seldom

small and contain mostly rare
books in law, medicine, and philo-
sophy, hindering greatly the effort
to place more emphasis on natural
and social sciences.
Prerequisites Lacking
_ Among the problems of organi-
zations at Central University is
the lack of prerequisites for
courses. Students may be taking
both an introductory and an ad-
' vanced course in the same subject
at the same time. Since few of
A . I the students are really prepared
for the advanced course, the pro-
fessor is ﬁorced to teach at a much
lower level; the end result is two
duplicate elementary c o u r s e s.
“Often a student never really gets
an advanced course,” remarks
Dean Schaeffer. -

Thus, although students spend
their entire college career
studying in only one ﬁeld and
learning little about unrelated
subjects, they still do not be-
come highly specialized, believes
Miss Andino, who attended the
University of Cuenca in South-
ern Ecuador.

Each faculty, such as law, medi-
cine or philosophy, functions in-
‘ dependently, which also leads to
duplication.
Need Full-time Staff
Another of the major objectives
the Ecuadorian officials are trying
. . to carry out, is the acquiring of a
v,...- full-time faculty and staff, which
is extremely difficult due to the
lack. of resources. When Central
_, University reopened in April, after
 ’i being closed two months because
' of "student riots against an Ecua-
dorian border treaty, it had for
the ﬁrst time Q full-time rector
‘and assistant rector. -
“At the present,” Dr. Schaef-
fer added, “the dean of the
medical faculties is a practicing

~/‘.

By VIJAY JAIN '

Few ‘authors now write what they
hope will be best sellers for their prin-
cipal source of livelihood. They. write
with an eye on the large -panoramic
screen which they expect that, by, the
grace of movie moguls, their story will

‘fill in the near future. Gore Vidal and his
‘latest offering JVLIAN (Little, Brown and Co.,
Boston and Toronto, $6.95) may be classiﬁed in
this category. . .
The book is‘ a pseudo-autobiography of
Roman'Emperor Julian the Apostate. Julian
ascends the throne with the campaign promise,
to restore gods of Hellenism to their former
glory and, unlike most political promises nowa-
days, Julian sets out to uproot "Christianity
from Rome, once electedto the high office.

The philosopher king is a hero shaped after
Plato’s directives, he is a Greek scholar, he has

reason, rhetoric, and persuasion. "Julian uses
satire to convert Christians’ to heathens. To
round up popular appeal of the hero he is" also
an essayist and a military genius which even-
tually is his undoing. ' ’

, Best Seller Ingredients _
The best seller’ ingredients present include
glimpses of his private life, namely his mar-
.riage with his cousin Helena and his affairs
with the ‘blue stocking’ Macrina. H
For the battle enthusiasts there are vari-
ous, colorful campaigns which Julian mas-
terminds. The scene changes from Constan-
" tinople to Athens to, Milan to Paris to An-
tioch and ﬁnally to Babylon.

Thus the book has all the ingredients of be-
coming a super-collosal, giant screen, multi-
million dollar Hollywood spectacular. As far as
the book itself is concerned, the subject needed
quite a bit‘ of research and consolidation of

‘JVLIAN’

    

facts, a job from which Gore Vidal did not
Shirk.
, Homework Well Done . . -
In fact the author went all out to make his
work reek of authenticity. So much’ so that at
times-it seems that he is placing facts before
his reader to emphasize the fact that, he has
done his homework and some extra work for
good measure. ~ 4 " i '
Fact and fiction is skillfully woven to-
gether to arrive at a. book doing full justice
-— to the highly complex and. historic‘ ﬁgure.
The intermingling of truth andfalsehood is
so good that the reader does not know when
he is reading the life of Julian and when it is
the brainchild of Vidal himself.

Vidal has made a name for himself for his
insight and his careful control of language in
such works as- The Best Man, Visit to a Small
Planet and his first Wtlliwaw which he wrote
at the age of 19. Julian measures up to the
reputation that he has established for himself.
‘It. may be an academic question-but he leaves
the reader with the view that a lesser man than
he would have failed at work of such great
magnitude. We tend to share that opinion.

Overall View

This is not tosay thatithere are no ﬂaws
in the entire work. There are the usual cliches
and pitfalls that authors knowingly‘ or un-
wittingly fall into when undertaking to write
best sellers which are later made into giant
screen spectaculars, but they may be classiﬁed_
as the ingredients necessary to make any book
a best seller or into a multi-million dollar
movie. , -

The book, taken as a whole, is excellent in
many departments and commends itself to the
reader. It should be read for itself as is being
done by thousands who have made it achieve
the best seller list. The movie may be good but
the reader should read the book just in case
the Hollywood.moguls decide to let this one
pass without notice.

’Pitt News’ Accepts .

Paid Political Ads

. The Pitt News will accept paid
political advertising starting in
September, the newspaper’s exec»-
utive board decided lastweek.

Previously, both political and
liquor ads were not acceptable
revenue. The solicitation of liquor
advertising would be in conﬂict
w-ith University policy, but there
is no record of any such ruling for
political advertising. A It

‘ Business manager Donald Fried-
man ‘expressed hope that this in-

VI

crease in revenue might oﬁset the ’

drop in funds due the lossof cigar-
ette advertising last summer.
