the care of rooms. Each student
will be expected to keep his room
neat; such as, clothes and shoes
in their proper places and books
and papers placed neatly, not
strewn about the room. Chores
such as these will not be the wor-
ry of the maids or janitors.

Residents will be expected to
join the University Hospital and

The price of this medical service
is $10 for 12 months.

Application in the dean of men's

insure the return of the key. The
deposit or a part of it will be re-
turned to the student at the end
of his term of occupancy.

There will be three lounges in
the dormitory where the students
can spend their leisure hours. Mr.
Ricart is looking forward to and
making plans for the day when

A POLL THAT WORKS

Student Congress’s ﬁrst poll results are in and the re-
turns are encouraging. The Interfraternity Council used the
newly-created opinion-sampling machinery to determine the
probable attendance at its winter formal. -
The poll showed that 62 percent of the fraternity men ex-
pected to attend". Sixty-six percent actually showed" up. That
four percent error isn’t bad for a “ﬁrst try. .
Right now the Poll Committee is interested in ﬁnding
more work for itself. There are so many people around school

about this “I” that‘ it shouldn’t be too difficult to keep the com-

mittee and its workers busy.

If you or your organization are interested in learning
student reaction to some question around school, contact Toni
Ryan, Student Congress" representative, as soon as -possible.

Rated oﬁ its sole performance to date, the P011 Committee
seems to be a worthwhile addition to Student Con-gress’s.ac-
tivities.

IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH SCHOOL
RECOGNIZED BY POLIO GRANT

A lot of us don’t appreciate the respect in which our Medi-

months something crops up to remind us of the Center’s repu-
tation. L \.

Fresh evidence came this week with the announcement of
the grant of $148,000 made by the‘ National Committee on
Infantile Paralysis to the University for research in the ﬁeld of
polio viruses. .

Together with the recently created, School of Public Health

_the grant emphasizes the prominent position that Medical Cen-

ter has achieved in national medical; circles.

New Major
At Syracuse

SYRACUSE, N. Y.—(I.P.)—
Liberal Arts juniors, sophomores,
and freshmen will have a choice
of a new major ﬁeld, the Amer-
ican Studies program, this semes-
ter, at Syracuse University.

To consist of courses in several
social sciences, the new sequence
will offer students a 30 credit ma-
jor in American civilization._Ma-
jors in the__new ﬁeld will be able
to choose 24 credits from three
groups. Requiring at lea_st six and
not more than 12 hours in each
group, the sequence has listed-
group 1 as literature, ﬁne arts, and
philosophy; group 2 has sociology,
geography, and economics; and
group 3 lists Citizenship, (advanc-
ed), history and political sci-
ence.

The courses "in each group will
be those pertaining to the United
States or American affairs, and
the ﬁnal six hours will be a sen-
ior seminar on the" overall topic.

The new sequence committee,
headed by Dr. Stuart G. Brown,
chairman of the Citizenship de-
partment, has. speciﬁed certain
p\rerequisites which students must
nieet intheir freshman and soph-
omore years. Th_ese include Amer-
ican literature, history, and polit-
ical science.

The committee pointed out that
Syracuse is not pioneering in this
sequence, “since Harvard, ~ Minne-

Reserve, and Williams universi-
ties all have similar major
groups.”

More Truth Thah Poetry

Two grid followers refuse to allow Pitt ’s astonishing sea
of ’48 pass on without comment, although they have no box
to pick about it. So, let’s make the.letters received the, ﬁi
post mortem and lay the record safely away.

One gentleman, who prefers to’
be known as “An Ardent Pitt
Fan,” encloses a clipping from
“Public Opinion,” the Chambers-
burg (Pa.) paper, underlining the
following portion of an article
quoting Harry,Dayhoff, referee at
the Pitt-Penn State game:

' “He went into detail on the up-
set of “Penn State by Pittsburgh
and stated that internal dissension
among the players was one of the
reasons for Penn State’s downfall.

“ ‘The best team didn’t win that
game,’ Dayhoff .. declared. ‘Penn
State did everything but lick
them in the score.’ ”

In Defense Of Pitt

“It may be true that Penn State was not up_to par, a
that Pitt was playing better'tha.n usual. But on this part

New Qualifications Announced

For Army Officer Commissions

The Military department released information this week outlin-
ing the methods whereby certain qualiﬁed personnel may obtain
commissions in the Oﬁicers’ Reserve Corps and the Regular Army.
Colonel J. I. Hincke, professor of Military Science and Tactics,
pointed out that these methods are in addition to the ROTC pro-

gram
Qualiﬁed veterans of any of

the Armed Forces, between the

pleted two years of college, can
apply for immediate commissions

as reserve second lieutenants
Veterans must have completed a
minimum of one year of previous
service and must agree to serve
on active duty for two years upon
receiving their commissions. Suc-
cessful aplicants are given a 12-
week training course and the op-
portunity to compete for a Reg-
ular Army commission.

Former World War 11 Army of-
ﬁcers who do not hold reserve
commissions and are under 47
years of age may also re-enter
the military service as reserve
officers on active duty. V

A former commissioned officer
of any of the Armed Forces who
served in such a papacity for at
least one year and who is less
than 30 years old may apply for
direct commission in the Regular

Armyuin addition to meeting the
physical standards, the applicant
must have a degree from an ac-
credited cbllege or university, or
be due to receive a degree before
June, 1949.

In order to satisfy the need for
technicians and specialists the
Army has provided for the direct
appointment in the O. R. C. of
qualiﬁed persons in all grades

-from second lieutenant to lieu-

tenant colonel. Appointments are
made in certain of the adminis-
trative and technical services. A
minimum. of a bachelor’s degree
is required to qualify as a spe-
cialist in these branches. No im-
mediate active duty is required
in this type of appointment, al-
though successful completion of
two years of extension courses is
mandatory for those appointed as
second lieutenants.

Added to Long List of Services

By FRANK JORDAN

The announcement yesterday
that the student desk has added
a message center to its growing
list of services emphasizes the
fact that the desk is rapidly be-
coming the hub of student activ-
ity.
If Pete wants to tell Joe he’s

cutting English class all he has

to_ do niw is go to the Student

Desk, write his message on a pro-
‘ vided card, and ﬁle it alphabetic-

ally under Joe’s last name. All

Joes, incidentally, are expected

to drop down to the desk every

now and then and look for any
messages that might have accum-
ulated for them. The ﬁle will be
cleaned out at the beginning of
each week.
. The new service supplements
but does not replace the Cwens
message box in the information
oﬁice on the ﬁrst floor of the Ca-
thedral. Both men and women
may use the new ‘message box.

But as Elizabeth Sharp, desk
attendant, points out, the message
center is just the latest in a long
line of desk facilities designed to
make things easiers for the har-
rassed student.

As of yesterday, the desk offer-
ed, in addition to the message
center, basketball tickets for the

Pitt-Allegheny game, Ski Club

memberships, Pitt Independent
, Association memberships, New-

man Club memberships, Foto

Club memberships, a box full of

Pitt Chest pledges still outstand-

ing, recorded Pitt songs, nation-
ality room prints, and a pack of

ID cards never picked up by stu-

dents.

a pencil, pen or scotch tape, let
you use her telephone for inside
calls, and explain the elevators
to you.

The latter comes under, the
heading o-f general information.
This takes up a great deal of Miss
Sharp’s time. She estimates that
she handles around a thousand

‘queries a day from students want-

ing to know the answers to such
diversiﬁed questions as “How do
I get to St. Francis hospital?’7 and
“Where can I get a class card for
English 185?”

To aid her in advising lost
and/or confused students, Miss
Sharp keeps on hand maps of the
University district, catalogues and
copies of University announce-
ments. ,

The desk itself was put into
service a couple of months before
Miss Sharp took over in Septem-
ber. Representing an outlay of
well over $5000, the desk was
built by the University to ﬁll a
long standing need for a center
of student activities. It is panel-
ed with expensive oak and sports
a sound-proof ceiling above it, all
looking rather bizarre amid the
comparative drabness of the
ground ﬂoor halls. .

F Carlson Gives

by Donald Giﬁ'in,
Sports Editor,

Sophs Chance -

" Dr. H. C. Carlson, the genial continuity proponent as practiced
by his Pitt basketball team, was chided by a Pittsburghsports
writer when, he started four sophomores and senior George Mc-

Crossin against Tech last week.

“Think they’ll be that easy, Doc?” he asked.

“I’ve got to give my sophomores experience,” he replied. “And
I can’t put them in at the end of our games. It’s usually too close.”

This on—the-surface, typical Carlson quote is actually more
profound than ﬁrst reaction toiit indicates. Most of the time when
his ﬂoormen build themselves an eight-or ten—point lead, they settle
back into a possession offense, which holds the margin at a stable

level.

‘Two notable exceptions were
the second Miami contest, when
the Panthers went point-happy,
and the Allegheny game Saturday
night.

After they had established a
comfortable edge over the tired
Allegheny club, Doc sent the ﬁrst

._ team to the showers and returned
the sophomores, who had allowed

Entertains Winning

Panther Basketballers 

A West Point basketball team, once-beaten but untested,

will be host tomorrow night to Dr. H. C. Carlson’s victory-minded 

Pitt Panthers. The Cadets will be out to avenge a 42-41 nipping
handed them by Pitt last season.
Army has played only twice, trouncing Union College, 60-45,
and losing to Brown; but neither game was a true test of ability.
Coach Johnny Mauer’s starting quintet ‘is a totally veteran af-
fair, a fact that has stirred up optimism among West Point fans.
Last year the same ﬁve had a mediocre record of eight wins in 17

games, but the experience should account for considerable improve- ~
A

ment. ,
The Pitts see no reason, how-
ever, why they should not bump

the Cadets into the loss column.
In the ﬁrst place, the Panthers
are riding the crest of a ﬁve-
game winning streak.

Secondly, the Panthers, usually
smaller than their opponents, are

every bit as big as the West

ointers. Both starting teams, as
a matter of fact, average exactly
six feet and one-half inch.

Another point in Pitt’s favor is
the rust on the Army basketball
machine. The Cadets, always late
starters in basketball, cannot pos-
sibly have gotten into the‘ swing
of things with only two games
under their belts.

But with a West Point lineup
which features such all-around
athletic ability as that of Arnold
Galiﬁa, famed gridiron quarter-
back, and Jim Rawers, well-
known fullback, the odds can be
set only by the ﬂip of a coin.

Freshman basketball practice
will be held tomorrow and.

ran so fast and so often that after
ten minutes of play, their oppo-

I What is more, the Gators, ac-
customed to falling back into a
shifting zone on defense, could
not fall back in time once fatigue
set in. And because tired men
show a greater tendency to foul
than fresh men, the Pitts spent a
pretty fair portion of their _time
at the foul line.

The result of Allegheny’s fatigue
was a 29-21 halftime lead for the
Panthers.

needed to stay eight or ten points

in front of thehaggard opposition. I

Sammy David and Dodo Can-
terna, I
point pair, were in excellent form.
David kept the scorers busy by
racking up 25 points, while Can-
terna put away 19. Most of David’s
points were made on short pitch
shots from the front of th hoop,
although on’ one occasion Sammy
tipped a ﬁeld goal from a distance
of ﬁfteen feet.

The game was unusual in that

the Panthers suspended their cus-
tomary rule against outside shoot-
ing. They shot from afar with
comparative abandon, but it was
still the close shots that did the
damage.

By MYRON KOPELMAN
‘Here at Pitt there are two strong arguments against the con-

brainy. The first is Nick Bolkovac and the second is Sammy David.

time and kept piling it on in the
second half.

Jim Steel of the Indians was
runnerup in scoring with twelve
points while Joe Esper led the

Peak led the mentions.

’_ The husky blond tackle was
named to the Fox—Movietone

, News ﬁrst team by dramatic Bill

Stern,‘ and received second team
honors on the NEA’news service
listings.

Nick also was named by the
Associated Press as “lineman of
for his work in the
Penn State game. Ironically
enough, the Nittany Lions only
accorded Bolkovac‘ second—team
mention on their all-opponent‘
eleven.

Captain lV[cPeak’s most signiﬁ-

.cant recognition came in his se-

lection by oteammates as “most
valuable.” He was also voted the
City’s most valuable lineman, and
was chosen as an end on the East
team in San Francisco’s Shrine

Phi Eps Display  

I Wh° ' P’ L
The Phi Eps and Pi Lams fought another of their traditional
battles Thursday evening. When it was all over the Phi Eps were

on top, 39-13.
Last year’s IF champs got off
late in the second quarter to lead

to a slow start, but pulled away

, 15-7, at half-time.

The Phi Eps showed class with lanky Bob Miller controlling
the backboards and the two diminutive speedsters, Curly Weitz

and Jack Goldsmith, hitting frorrtO
all angles on their_ shots.

Weitz with 13 points led ‘the
scorers. His running mate, Gold-
smith, was runnerup with 10. The
best any Pi Lam shotmaker could
show was Danny Benjamin’s four
points.

In another IF encounter, Delta
Tau Delta had too much on the
ball in beating Phi Delta Theta,
24-14. ‘

The Delts were 'never behind
and lead 14-3 at half-time in a
rough contest that saw 33 fouls
called. Bill Hawkins of the DTD
five, who sat out nearly the entire
l.ast half, led the scorers with 8
points. , ~
Winless SAM Quinfef
Upsets PiKA Club, 26-23 “’

The downfall of PiKA athletic
teams was fur9her indicated when
a winless SAM ﬁve upset the for-
mer IM rnonopolizers, 26-23, to
highlight Wednesday’s basketball
action at Trees gym.

Otherwise, favored quintets
walked away with their contests
at the hilltop court. ‘

The Sammies jumped off to a

quick lead and stayed there, al-
though they never extended their
edge to more than.ﬁve points.
They were ahead at half-time by
only two points.
1 Gene F-eingold headed SAM
scoring with 13 points. Frank
Dougherty paced the losers with
S1X. ‘

Using their regulars sparingly,
the undefeated Phi Eps beat Sig-
ma Pi, 30-18. Tall Sid Amdur led
the Phi Eps to their easy victory
by cording 14 points. Alcot had
six for the losers. . -

Of the three one-sided contests,
Delta Tau De1ta’s virtual white-'
wash of hapless Kappa Nu stood
out. The Delts, using a dozen
players, allowed Kappa Nu on}:

continued the point—making until
they reached 51-9.

Since so many man were used
by the Delts, Harry Wright and
Bill Weber had to be content with
eightvpoints apiece in taking high
honors.

High-scoring Jack Doyle, No. 1
man in IM action, hit his, game
average on the nose, hooping 16
markers to spark the Theta Chi
quintet to a 38-21 decision over

Alpha Phi Delta.

In the lone game at the Stadium,
the SAE’s came roaring from be-'
hind in the last three minutes to

top ' the Pi Lams, 42-33. Fred
Klein’s 13 points kept the Pi Lams
ahead most of the way. Red Moul-

 

ton, who hit with 12, led the rally-'

ing Yellow Jackets.

Students C-et Pointers
On Study Overseas

Dr. Elizabeth Waelti, visiting professor in the department of mod-
ern languages, will ‘address students interested in studying abroad
this summer at a meeting Thursday at 2:30 p. m., 330 C1.

The first in a series of speakers sponsored by the newly-creat-
ed University Committee on Educational Exchange, Dr. Waelti will

discuss the forthcoming summer
French and foreign travel.

Leaving in June, the students will attend the “Seven Weeks"

trip to Switzerland for a study of

Summer Course” of the University of Neuchatel, Switzerland, and

will then take a three-week tour

of France, Italy and perhaps Ger-

many. Dr. Waelti is the director of the American section of this

summer vacgtion course.

One of the big criticisms by
Americans who have previously
studied abroad is that since for-
eign schools are organized differ-
ently from ours, they did not
meet the needs of Americans.

Pupils Attend
Kansas Meet

Eleven Pitt stﬁdents journeyed
to the University of Kansas
Lawrence, Kansas, over the hol-
idays to attend the Ecumenical
Student Conference of the United
Student Christian Council.

University students attending

in

were: Howard Bright, Jr.. H.
Ralph Bishoff, Thomas Vates,
Estelle Nifong, Bessie Petett,

William R. G. Hopper, James Say,
Robert Ingram, Irene Curran,
Dozia Frazier, and Glenn Hutten-
hauer.

Mr. J. Fred Miller and Miss
June Rose Anderson, new Baptist
student advisor, were in charge
of the local delegation.

Sessions of the conference con-
tinued from Dec. 27, 1948 to Jan.
1, 1949.

Speakers for the convention in-
cluded Dr. John Mackay, Dr. A.
Nash, Mr. J. S. Bixler, Dr. George
Kelsey, Mr. Robert BilHeimer,
and Dr. Elton Trueblood.

“The Church and Personal
Faith” was the topic of the open-
ing platform program with Dr.
John Mackay. His address stated
that the Church has the answer
to the craving of present-day men
and women for faith. He also

stressed both a mental and emo-
tional love for God. ,

Dr. D.Elton Trueblood, author
of three books, a Quaker, and a
noted authority on religion spoke
on “The Church. and Dail Work.”
He told how a Christian slhould go
about choosing a vocation.

Something new in the confer-
ence setup were the small “Min-
con” discussion groups. Students
might discuss anything at all in
these groups that they considered
pertient. These discussions were
boiled down by a committee

which gave an overall anlysis of

the subjects discussed by the
groups in their daily reports.

The United Student Christian
Council which staged the confer-
ence is intended to be a union of
student Christians and student
Christian organizations. It stands
for interdenominational unity and
“widening channels of coopera-
tion” among student religious or-
ganizations.
