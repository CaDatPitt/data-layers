THE LITTLE sAvEl2

Among America’s great sav-
ers, George T. Coffee is 8.
legend. One day, George dis-
covered that by golng to sleep
with his shoes on, he could
save a full 60 seconds dressing
in the morning. Multiplying
this by 365 days-gave him
over 6 hours saved per year.
Then, multiplying this by 8

years~—gave him 48 hours—‘

or two full days saved! George
was giddy. “Think of it,” he
mused. “Two full days saved
to do anything . . . read,
sleep or go to Europe!”
Another time, George passed
a store that advertised “Save
$50 When You Buy These
$100 Suits!” George imme-
diately saw the fantastic op-
portunity . . . realizing that he
' could save $100 by not buying
any of these suits.‘ Thereupon,

he proceeded not to buy ten

suits and rolled up a tidy

$1,000 in a few seconds.
However, the best saving

George ever did by far-—was

when he happened on the

Van Heusen Vantage Shirt.-
Vantage is a shirt you don’t.

have to iron . . . so you save
on laundry bills. Wash it——
hang it up to dry-—that’s all.
“So what,” you sneer, “aren’t
there other shirts that can do
the same thing?” “Mebbe,”
we sneer, “but Vantage is a
cotton shirt——with all of cot-

. ton’s natural softness, poros-

ity and comfort. And it only
costs $5!”

Men—-grab a pencil in your
ﬁst. Figure out your laundry

bill for shirts for a year. Then.

ﬁgure out the price for seven
Vantage shirts. You’ll find

that Vantage shirts actually ' ‘

pay for themselves in the
laundry bills you save! See
you at the bank.

P.S. You can also save your-
self the trouble of searching for
lost collar-stays. For Vantage
shirts have Collarite sewn-in
stays which can’t get lost, keep
the collar neat, always.

Tomorrow the Student Union will be dedicated, This
day has been long awaited and widely anticipated.

To the average student at the University, in fact to all
students this is probably the ﬁrst real symbol of Pitt’s new
outlook on education. ' 3

The classroom and professional buildings are modern

-and sleek, the Midday Series is impressive and stimulating,

the new administrators and faculty are learned and effi-
cient, but to the undergraduate nothing so well represents
a renaissance, nothing so typiﬁes a spirit of intellectual

s inspiration as the opening of the student union.

Here the student will ﬁnd the solace and seclusion he

craves. He will also ﬁnd the companionship and open dis-
.9 cussion which he looks for in a great University.

It is a justiﬁable feeling of pride and satisfaction that

‘students will feel with the dedication of Schenley Hall.

For years there has been promise and excuses about

lntegration Disputes . .‘.

One School For All

In recent weeks one cannot pick up a paper or
listen to the radio for any length of time without
hearing of some new development in, or comment
on, the integration battle at Little Rock, Ark.

There are many people, both in this country
and throughout the rest of the
world who have differing and
deﬁnite opinions as to whether
or not integration is a good
thing, and if it is, just how fast
or how slow it should be insti-
tuted in sections of the country
where the majority of the pop-
ulation is against it.

On one side of the fence you
have the violent segregationists . 1
who will stand for nothing but separate schools’ for
whites and Negroes. On the other side are those
who just as ﬁrmly believe that a completely in-
tegrated school system for all states is necessary.

And then, somewhere in between these dia-
metrically opposed factions are those who favor
segregation, but who, like Tennessee Governor
Frank Clement, are also determined to carry out
the law as passed down by the Federal courts. An-
other individual who does not belong at either ex-
treme is the ever present middle of the roader, who
would like to please everyon.

Choice of Pupils

A letter, written to one of the downtown news-
papers expresses the idea of one such potential
pacifist. Quoting in part, “an 'American, Negro, or
white, should be allowed his individual choice of
which school his own child should attend.”

“If a Negro person desires his children to at-
tend a school with white children, then he should
have the right to see that his wishes are fulﬁlled.

Who Reaps The Harvest? . . .

    

 

   

 

And if a white person wants his children togo to
a school that only enrolls whites. then he should
also have his rights respected. There should be

schools only for Negroes, schools only for whites,

and integrated schools for both Negroes and
whites.”

While on the surface this sems like a very
happy solution to the whole problem, it is at sec-

ond glance, very impractical. The writer of the

  
 

 

letter was obviously in favor of doubling or even 7

tripling the number of schools now in existence in
order to give everyone a broader selection.

The writer also seems to feel it un-American to
ask parents to send their sons.and daughters to

school with children of other, races. As taxpayers, .

helping to support public schools, parents should

‘ have the right to send their children to the public

school nearest their home; a school which is at-
tended by all other children living in the same
school area. Whether or not the children belong to
the same race, religion, or national origin should
not determine the school which they.attend.

Unufair Standards

Those parents who do not wish their precious‘

children exposed to differnt colored skins have the
perogitive of placing these children in private
schools, or have a private tutor hired to give special
instruction. ‘ 1

As long as white and Negro adults are paying

taxes to support public schools it is gross injustice T

to ask one race to travel farther for their schooling,
or to use sub-standard facilities.

The only way in which mutual respect, under-'

standing and cooperation can be established be-
tween different races, religions, or family back-

grounds is for these different people to inter—mingle  k
and get to know one another on a common ground.‘iy-‘pig ‘

Big - Time Football



The Oct. 2 letter to the editor
of the Pitt News decrying the
student seating shortage at the
Oklahoma game brings to light
an often avoided but somewhat
tragic fact. This
i.n many ways,
fact being that,
p res e nt big-
time football
often seems
neither to be-
long to nor to
credit a uni- ‘
versity.

The gradual‘
increasing
ballyhoo pre- ’

ceding the

if game beg'an'not long after last

year’s. season had ended. ‘But
most-of the noise did not come
from students, at least not from
Pitt. students. ‘It came

ers, coaches, and, street corner
en,thusiasts.'By game time the
whole nation was aware of the
top-ranked position that await-
ed the winner. '
Fifty-nine thousand people
crowded into the stadium to see
the game. Among them were
many Pitt students who had
come to a supposedly school
function only to discover and to

‘ be turned away from what had

grown into an event of mass
public signiﬁcance.

There was not enough room
in the standsfor this group of
students. There was room for
business men, professional men,
laborers, city and state officials,
sportscasters, writers, and red-
jacketed out-of-staters, but there
was not enough room for stu-
dents.

After the game a thin, highly
intoxicated man, wearing a
white cowboy“ hat and -carrying

 

_ instead a
from sportswriters, sportscast—- .

sign, staggered to the edge of
the band and awkwardly“ mim-
icked the performing band lead-
er. There had been room for him
too.

It would be foolish, however,
to pretend that the distressing
results of such public encroach-
ment into an essentially student
affair was, or will be, peculiar
only to Pitt. During the current
season the situation will prob-
ably be repeated, -in one way or
another, at college stadiums

throughout the country.
Football Isn't Everything

.Of course there are many who
argue that student inconveni-
ences are frequent and that de-
spite, and because of, its adop-

. tion by the general public, big-

time college football is a good
thing. They seem to believe that

a university boasting a top team

automatically rises in stature
and is admired‘ and recognized
as a whole by the outsider. This
impression is more absurd than
unsound.

The outsider who follows a
particular team is interested
solely in football thrills- How
many individuals who can name
Ok1ahoma’s backﬁeld, or‘ can
rattle off the average weight of
its line, know anything about
the University of Oklah0ma"it—
self? .

What is the University noted
for? Is it a recommended liberal
arts school? Does it offer grad-
uate work in law, education, or
medicine? Most people neither
know nor care. The football
team, having won 41 games in
a-row, is obviously great but it
bears no reflection on the Uni-
versity. - '

What's Big -Is Good

Still, in spite of the failings of

a large rectangular “Beat Pitt”
big—time football, of its gradual
evolution away from the school
and into the hands of the public,
which views it much the same
as it views professional football,
there are multitudes of students
themselves who uphold and vig-
orously defend it. '
They like it because it is big.
Unknowingly they are guided by
a phase of modern—day inaterial-
ism which contradicts funda-
mental teachings and bases all
values on “show.” u
Sometimes their opinion of a
university actually depends en-
tirely on its footballteam; Like

‘fl

   

sir

the UCLA student who,‘ two‘

years ago, displayed his own
ignorance by belittling Princeton
University because it "played, as

he put it, "not the rugged West , T

Coastybrand of football, but
‘(pot/Sy'$!

Most students, however, are
fortunately not so "disillusioned,
and claim to ‘support theirteam
because of what is called “school

spirit.” If such a‘ thing as i"‘schoo1

spirit” exists then it can _be said
that ‘most students
speciﬁc desire for, or“ attraction
-to big-time football for its own

-.sake.

For if a student has _‘‘school
spirit” he can cheer and support
his team no matter who it plays
or what bracket it rests in. He
does not need backing from the
public or the press.’

College football

is a sport

have no L,-

which deserves a place on every

campus. But it sometimes dis-
plays itself in proportions that
seem to obliterate the unity,
character, and even theipurpose
of a university. It must be‘clari-
ﬁed to the point where “it. can be
seen» by all in its proper per-
spective. v .

Letters To The

Editor, the Pitt News: ‘

Wandering amidst the hills and
Gothic elevators of the Univers-
sity, I have heard more than one

disquieting rumor about the exact
nomenclature assigned to the new‘

“Brackenridge” in some quarters
has been termed a mistake. The
actual title in truth, these purists
have argued is “Breckenridge”,
after the founder of the school,

Hugh Henry Breckenridge.

Some intensive \search through
still-dusty archives in the.‘ elderly

fact. There were two men in his-

The latter, who is claimed to have

‘Panther Offense Hits New Hig 

  

As Gridders Down SC

By DAVID BREAKSTONE
The Panther football team pushed Southern Califonia all
over the Coliseum Friday night, but had a somewhat harder
time cracking over the goal line. They made itacross three

times, however, and this was
tory.

enough to insure a 20-14 vic-

The win completed a sweep for the Blue and Gold on

th‘e West Coast and brought theO

season mark to a pair of wins
against one loss.
Riddle Rolls
Fred Riddle, the good-natured
fullback from Crafton, was the big
noise for Skyscraper U. He crack-
ed the Southern Cal defense for
110 yards in 17 carries and pro-
vided vital momentum again and
again in the ﬁrst half.

Indeed, in the initial two
quarters. Riddle ran for 95 of
those yards and had the Trojan
athletic director Jess Hill in
awed wonderment at halftime.

“That fellow Riddle was un-

stoppable,” exclaimed the former

Trojan head coach. “He ran
‘through and over us.”
Riddle normally runs behind

Dick Bowen and Bob Stark at the
post, but started
against the Californians when the
ﬁrst pair were hobbled by injur-
ies. Bowen was a spectator for
the second consecutive wek, while
‘Stark played brieﬂy throughout
the game.

Panther Drive Stalls

The Jungle Cats won the toss on
Friday and elected to receive.
Dick Haley took the kick on his
own 10 and brought it out to the
28. In thirteen straight running
plays, Quarterback Bill Kaliden
ﬂawlessly moved his mates down
to the Trojans’ 16 yard line. Here
the drive stalled as the locals
failed to make the neded first
down by six inches.

After Rex Johnston picked up
a first down for the home town-
ers, the Pitt line dug in and
forced Quarterback Jim Conroy
to punt. Starting on the South-
ern Cal 42, Kaliden fooled his
opponents by pitching 16 yards
‘to End Bo Zanos for a quick
first down.

With Haley and Riddle alter-
nating at lugging the leather, the
Panthers pranced down to the Cal
1, where Kaliden leaned in for the
score with 1:12 remaining in the
quarter.-

Ivan Toncic ducked in and add-

ed the extra point. The score:
Pitt 7, Trojans 0. The first period
score was signiﬁcant in itself for
it marked the ﬁrst time a
Panther team had talled in the
beginning canto since 1955.
“B” Squad Plays

Coach John Michelosen em-
ployed the platoon system for the
ﬁrst time this year as Toncic pre-
pared to kick off. He inserted the
“B” squad to spell the regulars
and the move paid a rather
speedy dividend. Southern C_al
couldn’t move the ball for losing
ground, by penalty and Panther
alertness. Accordingly, Conroy
elected to punt out of the jam on
his own 15 yard line.

“Lineman—of-the-W e e k Art
Gob had other designs on Con-
roy’s plan. At the snap of the
ball Gob came barreling
through the opposition’s line,
neatly blocked the attempted
punt, chased the bouncing ball
into the end zone and fell on it
for a touchdown. Again he was
the “right man at the right
time.” Toncic’s extra point try
was blocked. '

After an exchange of punts
which set Pitt in a bit of a hole on
their own 6 yard line, the breaks
went to Southern Cal. Stark
picked up a first down at the 17
and on first down Toncic elected
to pass. He was hit as he faded
back, fumbled, and End Lou
Byrd smothered the ball.

Wrecker Rex Scores

The “A” team dashed back in
to avert a score, but Wrecker Rex
Johnston wrecked the scheme. On
third down Rex rambled home
nine yards for the six points. Full-
back Jack Isherwood converted
to narrow the gap to 13-7.

The locals moved, after the
kick-off, to the Trojan 22 be-
fore End Harry Douglas picked
off a Kaliden aerial. After an-
other punt exchange, Pitt got
close enough to let Nort Sea-
man try a 35 yard ﬁeld goal.
The kick, however, was short.

 

 

 

 

In IM Standing

Five teams remain unbeat-
en in the Interfraternity Foot-
ball League after the ﬁrst
week of play. Two of these
teams are in League A, two
in League B, and the fifth in
League C.

The leader in “B” is Pi Kappa
Alpha with a. 2-0 record. Delta
Tau Delta, last year's IF runner-
up, won its only game thus far
in the same divisiivn.

Sigma Chi and Kappa Nu share
first place in League A. Both
teams have won one game and
dropped none. In the “C” circuit
Sigma Pi is the only undefeated
team, having won its opener.

In last Thursday’s contests, Phi
Epsilon Pi drubbed Pi Lambda
Phi, 25-0, while Pi Kappa Alpha
also shut out Theta Chi, 21-0. The
win over Pi Lamb gave Phi Ep,
last year‘s Interfraternity League
champions, an even 1-1 mark in
League A.

The League is set up accord-
ing to the active membership in
each fraternity. In other words,
“A” includes the "ix fraterni-
ties with the largest member-
ship. “B" has the middle six,
and “C" has the smallest frater-
nities. C

One rule change has been made
this season. Section four under
“Eligibility Rules and Regula-
tions” originally read,
must play in at least two regular
league games with an organiza-
tion to be eligible for any play-
oﬁ‘s.”

The change has been made so
that instead of the second word
being "man,” it is now “pledge.”
Thus an active member may miss
all of the league games and still
be eligible for the playoffs.”

Haley intercepted the first pass
from scrimmage as the second
half began. He snared it on the
Cal 25 and returned it to the 12. A
clipping penalty set the ball back
to the 27, though.

Five plays later Haley turned
the corner for 7 yards and a score.
It was called back however as a
striped shirt lad noted a Panther
holding. Joe Scisley took back 10
yards and Riddle chipped in with
7 more. Toncic sneaked over from
the one and converted afterward.

Pestich Shines;
Scores Twice

By JIlVI LACEY

Sparked by Simeon Pes-
tich’s two last period goals,
the Panther Booters scored a
3-0 white—wash over the Den-
nison University Big Red last
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

Neither team could penetrate
the other’s ﬁne defense. With just
15 seconds left in the ﬁrst half,
Jerry Bressanelli, Pitt’s All Amer-
ican, intercepted a Denison pass
and moved into the Big Red’s
territory.

He passed to Sam Hazou, who
centered in from: of the goal to
Jason Shrinsky. Shrinsky banged
it home for a one-goal lead at lzalf.
time.

The third period was another A

defensive one. Neither team
could generate an offense. The
Big Red had two close “in” shots
at goalie Ron Goga, but both
times he turned the shots aside
to preserve hi; shut-out.

After the teams changed goals
sophomore Pestich put the game
out of reach of the Big Red. He
scored his ﬁrst goal on 2-. corner

the assist came from Ron Wyatt

Meet Ohio State _Next

The Panther’ Harriers completely outran the Slippery
Rock Rockets last Friday at the _loser’s home course by a 17-
41 count.

The first four men to cross the ﬁnish line were from the
local squad. Speedy junior Vince Timon and sophomore ﬁnd

Ron Rush crossed the tap@ simultaneously in the fast time of
20 minutes and 6 seconds whichﬁ-—»-~— — -—-

was just four-tenths of a second

Following that speedy pair we 0 6 OC Cb e 6 pd

came another Panther twosome.
Tied for third was Captain John
Christof and Bill Walters.
Two Slippery Rock men slipped
in next. They were John Dicken-
son and Jay Mooney who took
ﬁfth and sixth places. Ron Gold-
stein of the Blue and Gold follow-

Tom Dudas.

Coach Carl Olson is well pleas-
ed with the steady improvement
of Timon, Rush, Walters, and
Christof, but is still hunting for
that ﬁfth man to make this year’s
squad a to combination to
beat. He hopes Goldstein will
round into a good ﬁfth man.

goals were by the alternate line.
Coach Bemis is pleased with
the progress made by the squad
in just three weeks. He is par-
ticularly pleased with the work
of the alternate line. He still re-
gards Jerry Bressanelli as his
“Bread and Butter” player, and
Harold Kipp and Bill Eisinger
are rounding into a fine fullback
pair.

Goalie Ron Goga was injured
midway in the fourth period to
give the Blue and Gold a few
agonizing minutes. After a few‘
minutes Goga was ready to play
but Coach Bemis wisely took him
out for sub goalie Paul Ciancutti,
who preserved Goga's shut-out.

Next Saturday Coach Bemis
and his Booters will travel to Lock
Haven to play Lock Haven team.
This will be thefﬁrst ofpthree
games to be played ineight days.
The other games will be at the
Stadium against Grove City on
Oct. 15 and Slippery Rock on
Oct. 19.

Slippery Rock surprised Coach
Olson as they were stronger
than last year and better than
anyone had expected. Even
though they were improved,
they didn't give much opposi-
tion to the hurrying Blue and
Gold.

Coach Olson will get a better
‘idea of how good his Harriers are
next Saturday when they meet a
tough and experienced Ohio Uni-
versity team from Athens. They
will run the meet over the Schen-
ley Course starting at 10:30 am.
from Flagstaff Hill.

Reserves Open
Panther Offense

By ED KOLTISKA

Two victories is just what the doctor ordered al’t.e:r the drubbing
the Panthers took at the hands of Oklahoma. The coaching staff, in-
cluding John Michelosen, has been wearing a smile for the past three

days due to the showing of their new offense. It really iSn‘t a new«

offense but instead an offense that is opening up more as every game
goes by.

Truely, experience is the best teacher. The reserves as well as
the regulars have been ready to admit this. In the Oklahoma tilt the
Panthers displayed no offense, but in the Oregon contest, the locals
were in possession of the ball for the first nine minutes of the first
quarter. They moved the ball readily between the twenty yard line
markers throughout the game, but then the trouble came. Nothing
seemed to jell for the Panthers within the twenty and they had to
relinquish the ball.

In the Southern California game, the Jungle Cats seemed to
over come this difﬁculty as they drove for a touchdown in the
ﬁrst quarters; something they haven’t been able to do the two
previous games. '

The Panther line has come alive and has been opening up the cen-
ter for the backs. In preseason ratings the Pitt line was the most pub-
licized line in the East and in the last two games they lived up to
their reputation. They allowed Oregon 91 yards on the ground and
53 yards to Southern California.

Offensively the line paved the way for 108, yards in Oregon and
270 yards against the Trojans, whose line weight averaged 220 pounds
compared to 225 pounds for the Panthers. '

The biggest element of surprise has been the showing of the
reserve backs, Prior to season play, it was doubtful whether Coach

The score stood at 20-7. _
Toncic had taken over with the
"A’s” after Kaliden had suffered

ftlying block. The third quarter
:progressed in a tiresome manner
tas play was hindered by a verit-
able red storm of oﬁlcial’s hand-
tkerchiets. Ten penalties of the fit-
iteen yard variety were marched

t Southern Cal turned to the des-
iperate plan of attack to even up
the score. Reserve quarterback

passer, came in and started to fill

'passes. Inaccurate with thci excep-
tion of one. I
That cone came with four
minutes remaining in the third
quarter. On the Pitt 30 yard

lofted a high pass to the end
zone where End Don Voyne
brabbed it. Isherwood’s extra
point try was true. Pitt's margin
was now six markers.

Wood uncorked a pass with 55
seconds left to Back Jose Ortega.
I Flara covered on the play and was
;called for illegal maneuvers on
lthe Panther 39. Luckily, Wood’s
{aim on his next thre lobs was
Epoor, and the Panthers had their
tvictory.

On arrival at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport at 9 pm.
Saturday, the Panthers completed one of the longest road
trips (ten days) ever made by a Pitt football squad. In fact,
some old timers say that they can’t recall any collegiate team
ever making such a swing. So the Jungle Cats may have set
a record.

t Leisure time for the Panthers
The day after the game, As— %
t

Michelosen would give many 0  —
reserves a chance to play. But
due to injuries in the starting
array, reserves have proven
their worth.

With Dick Bowen and Jim
Theodore on the sidelines, Joe
Scisley was inserted in the lineup
and proved himself a mountain of
a man on defense and offense at
the halfback slot. Bob Stark took
over the fullback duties in Ore-
gon and was the leading ground-
gainer.

In the California game, Michel-
osen started Fred Riddle at full-
back in place of Stark who was
nursing a slight injury from the
previous tilt. And as it turned out
Riddle carried the load as he
picked up 110 yards in 17 tries.

To top this off, Dick Haley
operating from the halfback slot
hasn’t had a bad game yet. He
has added a lot of color with
hard, fast running and good de-
fensive coverage.

Bill Kaliden has shown a lot of
improvement since the first game.
He has opened up the offense
early in the last two games and
has greatly improved in his pass-
ing. In the last two games he
completed 50 percent of his tosses.

As an alternate at quarterback,
Ivan Toncic has shown he is cap-
able of taking over in tight
squeezes. In the Duck fray, Toncic

last minute and a half and came
through with a touchdown pass to
reserve end Art Gob with 22 sec-
onds remaining in the game.
Then again in the Trojan
game, Toncic replaced Kaliden,
who was injured in the second
quarter, and went on to score a
touchdown early in the third
period.

Backﬁeld coach Vic Fusia has
been very happy with the per-
Iormance of the backs. “They all
have been coming along fine and
we still haven“: really hit our.
peak, commented Fusia.

The Panthers to date have
shown one thing that the coaches
and fans always look for and that
is improvement. Continuing in
this direction, the Panthers can’t
help ﬁnishing up strong _after a
bad start.

Transfer Tea
an 12th F1001“

The women transfers were
guests of the University at a
tea on the twelfth floor on
Thursday afternoon. D e a n
Rush and the Transfer Com-
mittee, under the chairman-

ship of Mary Anne Siedle, were
hostesses.

Transfer women were escorted
to the tea by members of the
Transfer Committee, introduced
to Dean Rush and her staff and
to many student leaders. Each
girl received a Forum announce-
ment which will give her an op-
portunity to know more girls,
learn much about her new Alma
Mater, and to quickly feel a part

is of Pitt.

The following day, Friday. was
Activities Day. Every girl had an
opportunity to express her inter-
ests and to immediately become
a part of the extra curricular
program. Being a transfer, it is
assumed that she has established
herself academically at the Uni-
versity level, which is of major
concern.

Statistics are still not complete
but to date there are 133 women
transfer students representing 45
schools admitted for the year 57-
58. Any girl who has not been
notified of special transfer pro-
grams please see Mrs. Milligan.
Assistant Dean of Women. who
has personally contacted all the
transfer women.

Students who would like to
write news or features for the
PITT NEWS should come to
809 Cl any Monday or Thurs-
day. Positions are also open on
the copy desk and for proof
readers. Interested p e r s o n 5
should contact Millard Amdur.
