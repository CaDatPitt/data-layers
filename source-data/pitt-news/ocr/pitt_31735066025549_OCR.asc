The fear of an approaching ﬂu epidemic from

Hong Kong's avian ﬂu strain has been blown out of
proportion, say UPMC Health Systems researchers.
t "We might see another pandemic of ﬂu, but at this
point the risk of an epidemic is not high because the
key component to an epidemic is a strain that can pass
directly from person to person," said Dr. David
Tweardy, the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center's Head of Infectious Diseases.

The ﬂu is normally spread from bird to pig to
human, ‘and thus far has not been observed being
passed through personal contact.

Concern arose in the medical community recent-
ly after the usual pat-
tem of dispersement
shifted when nonnal
ﬂu strains mutated
into the avian strain
which went directly
from chickens to
humans.

The swine’s
removal from the
equation caused fear
that the avian ﬂu
would be harsher
than normal ﬂu and
that humans would
have little or no

 

Dr. David Tweardy
said the avian strain

is treatable because it is a mutation of one of the two
types of normal ﬂu strains, the A strain, which can be
prevented with an annual ﬂu shot.

‘ The B strain has less severe symptoms, is virtual-
ly untreatable, and is vastly less common than the A
strain. This mild case of the ﬂu is often confused with
the common cold Flu symptoms include a high fever,
coughing, sore throat, chills, headaches and overall
achiness. Cold symptoms may be ﬂu-like but are less
serious. »

Initially, PittTV was to
be an infocharmel which

over to a regular TV channel,
but Miller eventually realized
that she was aiming for two
different concepts. The ask-

$58,000, which wasn’t
enough to fund the launching
of a program-broadcasting

Most Pitt students in the over-21 crowd
have been in Oakland for at least three
years, so they know what bars and restau-
rants the area has to offer — CJ’s, Peter’s,
the Attic, etc. But in February, there will be
a new place to go to on the weekends.

According to Gregg Pangle, general
manager of the Beehive, if a liquor license
is granted, the Pollenator will be opening
sometime in February on the second ﬂoor
of the old King’s Court on Forbes Avenue.

“We’re all very excited about this. It's
really going to be a lot different than the
other bars in Oaklan ,” said Pangle.

Pangle said the Pollenator will have a
unique design to offer a fresh alternative to
the other bars around Oakland. ‘‘I think the
atmosphere alone will attract customers,”
said Pangle.

Resident artist Mike Saxman, who is
responsible for creating the Lava Lounge
on the South Side, will design the layout for
the Pollenator.

To attract a crowd, Pangle said Saxman
will incorporate lots of colorful decorations

and furniture and a booth that will look
down on Forbes Avenue. ‘The view from
the booth will be really cool at night,”
Pangle said

Music will be provided by a DJ,
although bands may play occasionally.
“I’m not sure if there will be a dance ﬂoor, 4,
but there will deﬁnitely be room for danc-
mg.”

According to Pangle, different themes 4*
will be featured each night to accommodate
everyone’s musical taste, however, the
management has not chosen any themes
yet.
The new upstairs bar/restaurant will1
offer a different menu from the Beehive’s
present one, creating a clear separation I
from the coffeehouse downstairs.

‘This will be a much more lucrative ;
business,” said Pangle. “Kids used to go
upstairs to sit but not buy anything. They‘
were loud and would scare away cus-
tomers.” .

With the great number of cotfee bars
popping up and pushing bars out of busi-
ness in big cities across America, some are

strain were either poultry workers or farm-
lies that lived in close vicinity to the fowl
fanns. Four are dead.

No one outside the fowl farms’ vicinity
has contracted the avian ﬂu from another
person, according to Tweardy.

"The strains out there now are not very
different from past strains so the immune
system will be able to ﬁght them adequate-
ly," Tweardy said, "but the virulence of the
avian strain has raised concerns."

The excessive measures undertaken in

‘ ' Hong Kong to contain this new ﬂu strain

elicited memories of past epidemics and
renewed fear in the possibility of future ones.
One past viral strain responsible for
massive global damage was the superﬂu of
1918, the Spanish inﬂuenza, It wiped out 25
to 40 million people within 18 months.
Doctors asked people to wear white

thirds of its victims among healthy adults

Tweardy . said that because the avian

strain will not cause an epidemic, it will not

‘ bring about catastrophic results like the

Spanish inﬂuenza, which some historians
believe contributed to the end of World War
I with its massive death count.

"Since the avian strain is different from

already existing strains, it will be under

heavy surveillance for a time," said Tweardy.

If a superﬂu were to strike tomorrow,
the affects would be disastrous because of
today's increased population in concentrated
urban areas and international travel.

"It's always a good idea to get a ﬂu shot
because of all the traveling done," said
Colleen Cross, an English writing major at
Pitt.

Since there are no established ways to
accurately monitor the spread of viral dis-

eases, it's hard to pinpoint where the geo- '

graphic problem areas are. Some people dis-
play nosyrnptorns of ﬂu, yet can be carriers
of the virus.

. Katie Grau, a Pitt student said, "I've
been scared of AIDS, now I'm scared of the
ﬂu. Is there anything left not to be afraid of?"

Andre Watson said it took a month to
ﬁnd Hillrnan Library on his own, and it
takes him a week each semester to suc-
cessfully locate his new classrooms.

And his freshman, year, while other
people were sitting outside the Towers‘
lobby to ﬁnd new friends, Watson was
spending most of his free time ﬁnding his
way around campus.

Watson is one of six blind students-at
Pitt. His aim isto make people feel com-
fortable with his blindness by showing his
independence and providing classmates
and friends with facts about what it’s like
to live without sight.

“I want people to know that disabled
people are people. I believe I can affect
things on an individual basis,” said
Watson.

A senior in psychology, he said his
education in perception allows him to
grasp common stereotypes of blind peo-
ple, and he works to abolishthem through
education.

Last semester, Watson gave a presen-

 
 
 
  
   
  
   
  

tation to his Spanish
class on writing and
reading Braille. He
wrote Spanish words
in Braille and handed
them out to students
to decipher.

“It was great. I
learned a whole lot
about Braille and a
lot of people I talked
to said they were
impressed with the
presentation also,”
said classmate Beth
McClaine.

and those at Pitt Disability Resources and
Services say he’s a popular guy on cam-
pus, Watson says he still deals with people
on a daily basis who underestimate his
abilities.

One of these people was a teacher
Watson had last semester.

“I think the professor didn’t want me
in his class at the beginning of the semes-
ter. He suggested I take [an oral form of the
class] instead of his written class,” said
Watson. ‘

Watson found he had to prove himself
to the teacher, which made him push him-
self even harder to excel. Spanish classes
are the hardest for him because no one at

found classmates who read to him. He
worked hard throughout the semester and
earned a high B in the class.

‘Towards the end of the year, he was
very nice and very good,” said Watson of
his teacher. “The teachers that are dedicat-
ed to the students —— they are the good
ones.” -

In addition to educating students
about his disability, Watson counsels par-
ents of blind children, telling them his per-
sonal experiences so they can better under-
stand and help their handicapped children.
He does this to help parents prepare for the
problems and stereotypes ahead of them.

Watson said his independence can be
attributed to his ~mother pushing him to
overcome his disability. Blind at age 9 as
a result of complications from a severe
case of pink eye, Watson’s mother
immediately taught him to never use his
blindness as an excuse.

“If I asked her for help in matching
socks and she knew there was a way for
me to distinguish between socks, she
would refuse to help me,” he said.

When choosing a college, Watson said
he decided to move far from his West
Philadelphia home to Pittsburgh mainly
because he wanted to gain more inde-
pendence.

But Watson admits that independence
alone will not get him through college.
He uses many tools to be able to take

example, he uses an electronic
Braillewriter to take notes in class. The
machine is made up of six keys that
write letters through various combina-
tions of the pressed keys.

The words are then stored in the
machine’s memory and can be printed
out or spoken. Watson said some blind

A students use tape recorders, but he likes
to have the notes right in front of him.

Most of the time, though, Watson uses
a laptop computer that lately has been
malfunctioning.

“That’s the only disadvantage to rely-
ing on a computer —— if you don’t have
it, you’re lost,” said Watson.

Watson succeeds in tasks on his own
most of the time, but sometimes must

classes and to make his life easier. For _

call Pitt’s Disability Resources for help.

The center acts as a liaison between
professors and disabled students, and helps
students with their individual needs.
Sometimes the students use.the workers in
the service as someone to talk to about
their problems.

“They’re a support group, in a way,”
said Watson.

Employees at the center read tests to
blind students and record their answers,
help translate hand outs from professors
and train them to ﬁnd buildings and
resources around campus.

“It’s funny. For a lot of students, it’s
just basic accommodations and testing.
But then there are students like Andre ...”
laughed Neely Main, an employee at the
center for ﬁve years.

Watson has earned a reputation for
being slightly disorganized.

Main referred to one of many stories
that circulate the center: the time Watson
dropped his ID card behind his TV and
called the service for help.

“We told him that if he needed us to,
we would come and ﬁnd it for him, but he

ﬁnally found it. He was just blowing ‘off 

steam,” said Main.

Watson is very involved with the cen-
ter. Main and another employee, Sara
Helms, said he comes up to the office to
chat sometimes. They say his individuality
and independence impress ‘them.

“He’s amazing. Look. He made us a
snowﬂake,” Helms said, pointing to the
white piece of intricately‘ cut paper hang—
ing by a string above her desk. “He made
the hearts on it better than I could have.”

Watson plans. to attend graduate
school somewhere close to Philadelphia
after he ﬁnishes at Pitt. After his schooling,
he hopes to be able to counsel other people
with disabilities.

“People need to know that it’s not the
blindness that’s the difﬁculty. It is the
stereotypes and assumptions that go along
with it,” said Watson.

with Windows constitute a “monopoly.” Think about it.
There’s no logical connection there at all.

The fact is, Microsoft has been attacked because it tried
to be honest, because it tried to make the better product. For
years, Microsoft employees sat in ofﬁces and created com-
puter programs that were so good, people bought them.

Gates became successful by providing quality products
to consumers.

Microsoft’s rivals, however, developed a different
plan. V
They’ve been lobbying Washington for some time
now, whispering in the ears of politicians and building up
anti-Microsoft sentiment with the lawmakers.

According to The New York Times, Microsoft had a
small office in Washington with only one employee until
very recently.

Now, it has been forced to play hardball and has begun
hiring professional lobbyists to start spreading the word
that Gates is not the devil incarnate —— a supposition that
politicians were eager to believe when properly seduced by
representatives from Netscape, Oracle and the like.

It’s too bad, actually, that this must involve Washington
at all, because most of our elected representatives don’t
know the ﬁrst thing about computers.

These guys are professional campaigners who spend
most of their days just raising money so they can run for
office again. You won’t ﬁnd too many computer program-
mers in that bunch. _

They don’t have any business pretending to be com-
puter experts and deciding whether Explorer is an essential
part of Windows, as Microsoft contends. They don’t know
anything about computer programming, and few would
understand any convincing technical arguments.

But understanding that, and not treating politicians as
computer experts, was Microsoft’s mistake. Gates swatted
at gnats who can arbitrarily decide his company’s fate,
based on who’s offering bigger campaign contributions.

Pittsburgh Tribune-Review
investigative journalist
Christopher Ruddy wrote a series
of articles calling into question
suspect circumstances involving
Commerce ‘Secretary Ron
Brown’s death. He then faced a
plethora of attacks and denials
from White House press secretary
Mike McCurry, the Justice
Department and New York Times
columnists. The onslaught of ver-
bal outbreaks begs the question —
What is there to hide?

Mystery has surrounded Ron
Brown’s death from the day his
Air Force plane crashed in
Croatia. The exact cause of the
crash that also killed 34 other
businessmen and aides has never
been determined. Strangely, the
plane was never equipped with a
black box that would have record-
ed communication and technical
data in the cockpit. Black boxes
are standard for Air Force planes,
as well as commercial ones.

Beyond these initial eyebrow
raisers, Air Force Lt. Col. Steve
Cogswell,
examiner, came across photos of
X-rays that show a .45 hole and
metal fragments in Brown’s head.
A .45 hole could have been caused
by a .45, .44, or .40 caliber gun.
Despite this, no autopsy was con-
ducted. Allegheny County
Coroner Cyril Wecht has stated
that, in such situations, autopsies
are standard procedure.
Therefore, someone with the Air
Force medical examiners would
have had to order that an autopsy
not be conducted. Both Cogswell

and Wecht say an autopsy should
have been done.

They are not the only voices
calling for a serious examination
of these questionable events.
Support from powerful blacks
across the nation has been
swelling. NAACP President
Kwesi Mfume, U.S. Rep. Maxine
Waters and Rev. Jesse Jackson
have been relentless in their
demands for an _investigation.
Civil rights activist Dick Gregory
was arrested outside of the Aimed
Forces Institute of Pathology dur-
ing a protest with more than 50
people. »

Three questions stand out:
Where is the mainstream media?
Why the vicious reactions? And
who the hell does everyone expect
to do the investigation?

Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw,

Peter Jennings and Bernard Shaw
have never once covered this con-
troversial, hard news. Instead, we
are fed the usual schlock —
Buddy vs. Socks or Michael
Kennedy vs. the Tree. At a radio
station over Christmas break, the
headline coming over the AP wire
was Chris Far1ey’s death (even 48
hours later), while Gregory had
assembled more protesters than
the environmentalists usually
have. This issue has been relegat-
ed to the realm of talk radio in yet
another demonstration of the left-
wing persuasions of nightly news
shows.

Second, what does the White
House, the Justice Department,
and the New York Times have at
stake that makes them launch

vital information due to uncooper-

The FBI or CIA would seem
the only avenues that possess the
resources to carry it out, but their
independence from the White

between none and Bill), an FBI or .

Opinions Editor

I’m afraid for FAS.

Provost James Maher holds control
over the future of Pitt’s biggest school. He
has the sole responsibility of choosing the
next FAS dean, and I’rn worried lre’ll feel
pressured into making the wrong choice.

I don’t really know Maher, so I can’t
tell you how he’ll hold up against the stress,
but I can assure you that there’s sonre pres-
sure for him to do the wrong thing.

What would that wrong thing be?

Picking Charies Cnudde for FAS dean.

Cnudde is a dean at Florida State right
now. He’s survived a search comrnittee’s
interviews and a visit to Pitt to become one
of only three candidates left ﬁom 97.

But he’d be a terrible mistake for Pitt.

Cnudde has no vision. He’s a terrible
public speaker who, at the open forums,
read disturbing ideas from 3x5 index cards.
Actually, he read at the 3x5 index cards,
making it diﬂicult if not impossible to think
ofhim as aleader-——not agood quality to
look for in someone you want to inspire and
lead a school.

What disturbing idea did he endorsed?

He actually said the parents of under-

graduatesposeathIeattotheAmericanuni—‘

versity.
Apparently, parents, and some stu-
dents, are self-important enough to actually

thout vision does not a good dean make

want an education. He said parents threaten
universities by wanting their children to
obtain practical knowledge so they will be
competitive in the job market when they
graduate.

How dare they?

Well, I’m sorry, Dr. Cnudde, but I must
be a bit naive. I, too, thought we were sup-
posed to learn something at school. I must
have been pretty stupid to want a job when
I’m ﬁnished with a fonrral education

I, too, must be dangerous to this uni-
versity, as are my parents.

Maybe I’ll appreciate your point of
view better one day when I become a fac-
ulty member at a research university. But I
sure hope not. ‘

Pitt is a research university, not a
research institution. The campus isn’t
meant as a playground for researchers try-
ing to invent the better mousetrap. ’

Universities developed out of
researchers’ desire to pursue their interests
and follow their bliss. They couldn’t make
a living at it if they weren’t providing a ser-
vicetosornebodyelseintheprocess.

The same holds true today. No matter
how many grants and endowments Pitt has
ﬁom government and private sources, Pitt
would collapse instantly if there were no
more students paying tuition. .

Ahhh,butthatseemstobetheonly
reason why anybody might consider

Cnudde. Apparently, he likes fundraising.

Personally, I don’t think this guy could
sell a candy bar to his own mother at clear-
ance price. He just doesn’t have any charis-
ma whatsoever. That much was obvious at
the open forums.

In fact, if I were considering endowing
a few million dollars to Pitt, I’d want to
know that it would be well spent, and this
guy would scare me away from believing it
would be. I’d want to know that people
would use their time spending my money
wisely, not just going around asking people
for more.

Pitt needs a leader, a visionary, an
administrator. The dean is not supposed to
be a PR liaison trying to sell Pitt to rich folk.
That’s what we have a chancellor for.

Apparently, a few poor souls were
impressed when Cnudde name—dropped at
the open forum, citing that he once met
with Newt Gingrich and asked the politi-
cian for a letter of introduction to some
potential beneﬁciary for Florida State.

Big deal. He didn’t say he was suc-
cessful. Just that he had some idea for “cre-
ative” fundraising. Creative only impresses
me when it works.

But that might not matter to adminis-
trators who are probably panicking right
now. Pitt is still in the “quiet” stages of a big
(read: $500 million!) fundraising cam-
paign. “Quiet” means, “We haven’t raised
at least half the money yet, so we’re not

do poorly and embarrass ourselves.” That’s
probably a smart policy, since the word on
the street is they’re behind, big time.

Maybe that’s why Cnudde made the
cut and is one of the three ﬁnalists: in case
somebody decides it’s more important to
try anything and everything to raise money
than it is to hire somebody who is focused
on how to properly spend it.

FAS has struggled with a big school
and a small budget for some time now. In
fact, in the 1970s, before Peter Koehler
became dean, his predecessor had to con-
tend with a growing school and small ﬁscal
resources. Not everybody was happy with
the way that guy handled things. Not every-
body is happy right now with Koehler,
especially those from departments whose
budgets were threatened last spring by the
deﬁcit FAS has been run in.

This capital campaign won’t help edu-
cation much if most of the money goes to
building a convocation center and new
scoreboards for the Athletics Department.

The only thing that will help acade-
mics is a dean who cares about education
more than anything else, and is more inter-
ested in deciding how to properly budget a
school than in hobnobbing with rich people
to size them up for donations.

Kris Kissel hopes James Maher has the
courage to do what is best for FAS, because
it won’t be easy to do.

Yinzers relent:
Broncos deserve
the Super Bowl

Something drastic happened on
Sunday afternoon, something that
will affect all Pittsburghers, both
now and far into the future. This

news is big bigger than a double
kielbasa and ‘kraut sandwich.

Be warned: It’s more discourag-
ing than the steel mills closing,
more disheartening than Mario
Lemieux’s retirement and more
gruesome than rush-hour traffic.

The Steelers lost.

In the past, those words have

had a profound impact on the col- .

lective psyche of Pittsburghers.
Some people have been forced into
a depressed state resembling an
Irish wake. Others have binged on
Iron City until they became rounder
than Jerome Bettis. Still others have
taken out their aggressions on those
old Bubby Brister voodoo dolls.

But guess what? The Steelers
were outplayed by the Denver
Broncos on Sunday and they
deserved to lose. And most people
don’t seem too upset.

Most prognosticators expected
that the AFC Championship game
would be closely contested. The
oddsmakers in Las Vegas agreed,
first making the Steelers a one—point
favorite early in the week before
shifting the advantage to the
Broncos by game time,

While there were, of course, a
handful of yinzers spouting off out-
landish predictions (“Dude, take the
black an’ gold 65 to nuthin’ n’at”),
most sane people predicted a much
closer contest.

Maybe that’s why Sunday’s 24-
21 Denver victory seemed much
less disparaging than other Steeler
losses.

The Steelershad beaten the
Broncos 35-24 just one month ago,
playing one of their most impres-
sive games of the year. They were
able to put together a complete
game, bouncing back from a 14-
point deficit. Both Kordell Stewart
and Yancey Thigpen had the best
games of their careers while the
Steeler defense shut down the
Broncos’ running back Terrell
Davis.

ll lth-ranked Panthers take out l8th-ranked Golden Eagles, 29-8

Brian Knavish

Staff Writer

The casual sports fan who
glances at the Pitt wrestling sched-
ule and sees Clarion might think it
is one of those push over matches
used to pad the team’s record.

But the Golden Eagles, despite
their school’s small size, are an
annual ‘powerhouse and were
ranked 18th in the nation when they

traveled into Fitzgerald Field
House last night.
But Clarion’s impressive

resume didn’t matter. The Golden

Eagles got blown away 29-8 by the
llth-ranked Panthers.

“It was a great performance, a
lot of our guys came through for us
tonight,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said.

The teams traded technical falls
in the first two matches of the
evening. Clarion’s Lee Pritts cap-
tured an 18-2 victory at the 118-
pound weight class, and Pitt sopho-
more Rob Loper dominated in his
17-1 victory at 126 to tie the team
score at 5.

“I felt pretty good,” Loper said

The two best battles of the

On April 18 at the Downtown Hilton
Hotel, Pittsburgh Panthers’ quarterback
Pete Gonzalez and Coach Walt Harris
will put on their best suits for the annual
Dapper Dan award banquet.

The banquet, which has hosted local
legends like Dan Marino, Roberto
Clemente, Mario Lemieux and Terry
Bradshaw, is held yearly, with nominees
for the organization’s Sportsman of the
Year award in attendance. Sixteen local
sports ﬁgures are invited, with Harris and
Gonzalez. the only representatives from
the University.

“I’ve lived here for less than a year,
so I’m not sure exactly what the award is
all about, but I’m very humbled to be up
there with the past winners and norni—
nees,” Harris said.

Harris said that he wasn’t sure if he
was accepted into the community yet
because many people only know him as a
coach, not as a person. “I think I’ve got a

long way to go, but it certainly is an
honor to be nominated,” said Harris.
Gonzalez is looking to be the first
Panther to win the award since Dan
Marino won in 1983.

Pitt may have dropped the in my mind he could win it [nation-

Panthers three team points — the dif-
ference between a minor decision
and a loss via pinfall.

“I am [happy], but I’m not,”
Jesko said after the match. “I
thought I wrestled pretty good, but
there’s always room for improve-
ment.”

Clarion alumnus Kurt Angle was
on hand last night to watch his
school, and was impressed with his
nephew’s progress.

“Mark is performing at national

Olympian said. “There is no doubt

The match at 142 was equally as
exciting, as redshirt sophomore
Mike Ziska upset Clarion’s Tom

nation, in a 3-2 nail-biter.

“I’ve had a bad year. Hopefully
this will be a turning point for me,”
Ziska said.

Redshirt junior Brian Pardini,
who battled his way into the lineup
this week to earn his first varsity
start, gave Pitt an 11-8 lead with his

“Pardini did a great job. This

University of Auburn in March -
something that the team failed to do
last season.

“Everyone is pretty upbeat
about the season and we’re really
looking forward to it,” Stefanski
said.

As the Big East season
approaches, Coach Knoles is opti-
mistic that the Panthers can repeat
as conference champions as long as
the team stays focused and confi-
dent.

“If I was a betting man, I’d put
money on us to win the Big East
again,” Knoles said.

The Panthers will return to
action on Saturday, Jan. 17, when
they invade West Virginia at 10
a.m.

Their 1998 home debut will be
on Saturday, Jan. 24 versus
Villanova at 1 p.m. at Trees Pool.
Pitt will conclude its dual meet sea-
son by hosting cross—town rival
Duquesne on Feb. 7 at noon.

Meets are free to Pitt students,
with diving competition taking
place one half—hour before swim-
ming begins.

COLUMN

ﬂawless game, such domination
was not in the cards this week-
end.

The Broncos refused to be
denied a spot in their fourth
Super Bowl. The ageless won-
der, John Elway, showed the
poise and confidence that 15
years of NFL experience had
brought him by leading the
Broncos to victory. If Stewart,
in just his first season as start-
ing quarterback, took notes on
Elway’s performance, the
Steelers will be in good shape
for the future.

Jerome Bettis ended up hav-
ing a statistically better game
than Davis, but the Broncos’
runner made the big plays when
they mattered most, first with a
43-yard run in the first quarter
and then with a clutch run‘ late
in the fourth quarter that iced
the Steelers’ fate.

After the Steelers spotted
Denver a 24-14 lead, the
defense was able to shut out the
Broncos in the second half. But
it was the Bronco defense that
tightened in the final quarter,
preventing the Steelers from
coming any closer than three
points.

FROM PAGE 8

In short, the Broncos made
the plays that mattered most.

Sure, there were other con-
tributions to the Steelers’ loss.
Stewart’s erratic play certainly
contributed; his two intercep-
tions in the end zone and one
fumble stunted three potential
scoring drives. . Thigpen
dropped two crucial passes for
large gains. Plus, two touchy
pass—interference calls against
the Steelers may have changed
the outcome. 5 .

But in the end, it was the
other team’s strong play, not the
Steelers’ errors, that decided the
outcome. While the Steelers had
the advantage against the
Broncos a month ago, this
Sunday it was the Broncos’ turn
to play a ﬂawless game. They
earned the right to represent the
AFC in the Super Bowl.

So for once. these words
won’t be as hard to swallow:

The Steelers lost.

credited them for his personal
success. “Personal achieve-

- ments are great; however, it’s
a small piece in the big pic-
ture. I think the whole team
deserves to be nominated,”
said Gonzalez.

The Panthers face com-
petition from all areas of
Pittsburgh sports. Steelers
representatives include
Jerome Bettis and Kordell
Stewart, while the Pirates are
represented by manager Gene
Lamont and no—hitter-throw-
ing Francisco Cordova.

Al Abrams, the late editor
of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, started the Dapper
Dan Club in May of 1936.
Abrams wanted to start a club
for sports and business ﬁgures
who were “dapperly dressed.”
Abrams labeled his choices as
“Dapper Dans,” which he
included in his column.
Hence, the stylish suits.
The idea was intended to
build local interest, but before

. Abrams knew it, there was a

waiting list of four to ﬁve
hundred people. Abrams
spawned the idea of a sports

Abrams and his friends
made $800, which they
donated to charity. In addi-
tion, Abrams hosted a PGA
event called the Dapper Dan
Open and a heavyweight
championship ﬁght at Forbes
Field. The events made
$250,000 for charity organi-
zations.

Abrams died in 1977, but
the Dapper Dan award ban-
quet is still a prestigious
award in the Pittsburgh area.
The award has since evolved
from the best dressed into the
best overall sports ﬁgure.

Dapper Dan Charities
Inc., which presents the
award, is a major organization
in the Pittsburgh area. It con-
tributes to many different
