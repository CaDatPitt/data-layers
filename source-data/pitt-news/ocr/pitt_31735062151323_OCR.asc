b . ‘Plenty of Baseball.

 “This is a wonderful country for base-
ball because you could start playing the
ﬁrst of March and play until November.

e evenings are long now and we get
quite a bit‘ of baseball practice after
supper. Our officers have a strong team
and we will have some hot ‘games -this
summer. The first game they walloped
~us good, but_'then we had not been prac-
ticing. I am sure we can beat them.
We are going to an artillery camp about
thirty miles from here, to play this
week and will have many short trips
like that this’ summer. _ _

This is beginning to look like a. small
city instead of a hospital. They are
building many new wards and barracks,
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C; A. huts and
now they have a railroad built from the
main line right into the hospital. It
will save a great deal of hauling, bot
of.patients and supplies. "

“We have been having some dandy
Phi Gamma banquets over here, each
month. ‘In, May we are to have 8. big
Founders’ Day banquet, and are trying
to get in touchlwlth any Phi Gamms
near —here and have a large turnout. ‘

]'ack’s Letter.
,,Jack’s letter is as’ follows:

.“Just a short note to share with you
my recent pleasure in visiting the Pitt
Base Hospital. Over Sunday a friend
and I ﬂew about 150 miles over to the
place where they are stationed. It was
exactly like going home to drop in on
them. Old friends from the Major
down to ‘Andy’ Hastings and ‘Pety’
Davis, who were hauling coal and looked
it. Lieut. Max Neal, as dentist, took us
under his wing and gave us the key
to the hospital, with Major Arbuthnot’s
sanction. Every» minute or so we were
meeting old friends. It was great. ‘Chip’

bunch more came-sailing up and added
to the homey feeling.‘ A big Univer-

place added to the last touch. Itijust
made_ you"exp'and and, believe me, I ex-
panded. -~ I »

They were ,

“After lunch my friend did a. little
exhibition ﬂying for a while and I can-
; tended myself with trying to land in a
;little football field near the hospital,
,doing nothing more spectacular than
§diving into the ﬁeld and climbing out
‘rather steeply over some telegraph
wires. '

“The more I get of that kind of
friendship the larger place the Univer-
sity gets in my heart. Those four years
moulded me into a man with friends,
which is a high ‘point inany one's lad-
der of ambition. Even though I may
never have my diploma from the Uni-
versity, she will always be my foster
mother and I hope the poor efforts I
.make at bringing her credit will partic-
ularly repay my debt to her.

A LETTER   FROM
“GUNBO_A_l"’ SMITH

Monday Eve.
Dear Buck: ' ,

I shouldn’t take this time to write,
but I will just drop you a note.

I have just finished my,ﬁrst day's
real work. I like it 0. K., but had
a big job wished on me ‘ ' .

The first thing this morning we
were out for "hrill. There‘ are only
5 meniin -our class who have not had
military experience before coming,
here. The instructor found an awk-
ward squad the l‘ll'S'l'. crack out of the
box and told all who had not had
previous ‘military experience to. join
i-t. I had a ‘hard time deciding
whether to go or not, vbutgat last I
decided to put on a bold front and
stick. Then the instructor came up;
to me and asked,"“Where did you
have military experience be-
fore?” I told him and vhevsa-id '“O.
K., you can stay.” He took us all
out among the trees and gave some
twenty men of us that ‘he zpicked out

a chance to take the company for a

little close order dri1l.— Then he
asked if any men thought they could
do better.‘ Some said «they could and
were given a chance. He knocked
me cold when he said Cadet Smith,
will be Captain of Company M from
now on. Then he announced First
Lieutenant, Second Lieu-tenant and
First Sergeant. Honestly, it has had
me on the jump all day. Starting with
drilling the boys among the trees,
then two hours on the drill grounds,
then regimental ‘formation, one hour
on the drill‘ grounds this A. M., re-
view and' ‘inspection this evening.
Bel-ieve me when I say that I only
made one big mistake, and they al-
ways excuse mistakes of cade“t~ofﬁ-
cers the ﬁrst ‘-week or so. But, be-
lieve me, when youiget mixed up in.

GOOD MATERIAL
FOR TRACK TEAM

There is a wealth of material avail-
able for the track team this year, and,
while there is a large number of
candidates’ out now, there are still a
good ‘bunchin school who shouldibe
out. Coach Kerr is anxious to get

hard season ahead, and the men will
need all the workouts they can get
in. With -these bright sunny days
here‘now there is no further excuse
for «the men not coming otft. I
The sprints and middle—dis-tance
men are the most abundant and
these events seem to be well taken
care of. Shea, Albright, Peters, Eek-
hardt, Addleman, ‘Thoma-s, Town-
s‘hen-d, Miller, Bovard and »Klingen-,
smith shape up as the best bunch of
runners that has ever been out for
the Pitt’ V.ars=it-y. .
' In‘ the weigiht events the candidates
who have come out are not of the
highest caliber, but should add some
points ‘to score. Of‘-course '-Captain
Southerland will be the standby in
these events, and «there are MrcLaren,
who is developing well and has the
stuff in him; Easterday, a pretty good‘
shot putter, and Stanford, the weight
man ofibhe freshman team lastiyear.
There is also a p«ossib«ility‘tha:t Jake
Stahl -will take up work in this dc;
pantment of ﬁae1_d:activi.'ties.. _.
There are a good list of .ca+ndiidate‘s

olas, Misch and Speck doing good
and coming sthrong. The
hurdles as usual are -the’"iwe‘akes~t end
of the team .and in the past" -this
weakness has/beendthe cause of sev-
eral defeats.’ It se-ems Timpoissible to
get.good thurdlers in school. The
