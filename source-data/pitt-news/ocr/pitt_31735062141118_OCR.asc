, Those Concerned Said . . 

“I would like every student-
fraternity and non-fraternity alike
—-who saw or has any evidence of
fraud in yesterday’s election to see
me between 1:30 and 4 P. M. to-
day in 801 Cathedral. We already
have evidence of fraud, but we
want all the proof we can pos-
sibly get. It is absolutely vital that
we get every piece of evidence, so
that even the most skeptical can-
not doubt that the will of the ma-
jority of the students has been frus-
t':ate_cl by unscrupulous and dis-
honest methods. To have the stu-
dents‘ money spent and the stu-
dents’ affairs regulated by ‘repre-
sentatives’ elected through fraud
would be to make a farce of stu-
dent government; that is why ev-
ery student should help see that
dishonesty does not win.”

Hiram Milton, C42.

I am greatly pleased with the re-
sults of yesterday's election, and
feel that support against the con-
veniently styled amendment prov-
ed clear thinking. /

It is really unfortunate that the
voting on this amendment was so

close as the opposition is already
trumping up stories of the corrupt
voting that is alleged to have taken
place.
Obviously,

April 2, 1942

Fraternities Win 21 Seats
in SFA; independents, 69

Charging fraudulent voting on the part of Fraternity
men, the Independent party refused to accept the one-vote

772 to 771 defeat of an amendment for equal
of both p-arties in Student-Faculty association.

representation

Represented by_I-Iiram Milton, C42, independents Will not
contest the election of 21 Fraternity and nine Independent

members to SFA, but will ask
the present Student-Faculty
association to set aside the
vote on the grounds of fraud and
decimi-e the amendment passed. If
this is refused, says Milton, the
protest will be carried to adminis-
trative officers.

Deﬁnite proof of dishonest vot-
ing methods on the part of Fra-
ternities has been obtained by In-
dependents in the form of identiﬁ-
cation cards that were being used
by students to whom they did not
belong, according to Mi1ton’s ac-
cusation.

Affidavits can be produced, states
Milton, from students who saw tri-
ple voting, who saw the same iden-
tilication cards being used by dif-
ferent students.

Serving as watchers, Fraternity
men permitted other Fraternity
people to vote more than once,
and put to general dishonest use
the card-punching system. (Each
identiﬁcation card is punched,
which allows the student to vote
only once.) ‘

Fraternity men had little to say
about Independent charges of frau-
dulent voting, except that they
were untrue and that Independents
had also attempted to vote more
than once. They said that proof
of this would be forthcoming.

Milton, however, maintains that
Independents have sufficient veriﬁ-
cation of Fraternity dishonesty to
demand the passage of the equal
representation amendment or at
least another general election, if
necessary.

If the amendment is declared
passed because of the fraudulent
vote, Independents will have gain.-
ed equal representation for the
ﬁrst time, and SFA will have 16
Fraternity yand 16 Independent
representatives.

According to the present sys-
tem students vote for individual
candidates in SFA, College associa-
tion and Men's council. The amend-
ment would provide that the 16
Fraternity men gaining the high-
est number of votes and the 16
highest Independents would be
elected to the 32 seats in SFA.

Statements of the Dean of Men
and Fraternity and Independent
leaders appear elsewhere on this
page. Solicited by the Pitt News
were statements‘ from other fra-
ternity leaders, but they could not
be reached late yesterday evening.

Complete election tabulations,
most news-worthy feature of which
is Independent Aldo Icardi’s smash-
ing of the all-tirne high vote mark,
are listed above.

, Gentlemen .7

General student elections went ‘off this year about as
expected.

Fraternities placed a large majority of their candidates
in oliffice; independents placed a small number of candidates
in 0 ice.

But the “Equality” amendment turned out to be quite
a surprise. One-—only one small vote—-beat the purpose
of the amendment: equal representation in SFA for fra-
ternities and independents: and changed the entire com-
p-lexion of the new SFA.

Independent leaders charge that there was much fraud—
ulent voting at the polls on the part of fraternity men and
women.

There should be an immediate investigation of these
charges.

For if what Independent leaders claim has any element
of truth in it——and we ﬁrmly. believe that it does——then the
standard of gentlemanliness and common decency at the Uni-
versity has hit a new low. ,

It is not gentlemanly to vote twice.

It is not gentlemanly to encourage fraudulent voting.
Fraternity men have aided—with little doubt—fraudulent
voting.

It is common knowledge that fraternities have made a
practice of cheating at elections. ’

In years past they have jammed the polls at noon, voted ’

any number of times, sat in the voting booths reading papers
in order to discourage independent voting.

This, we say, is common knowledge. It has been done
before. But before—-except for such a situation years ago in
which another electien was called—nothing has been done.

This year something had better be done. Or the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh becomes a school in which the meaning
of gentlemanliness has been smirched beyond repair.

No administration officer will be able to stand up before

the student body and mention the word “gentleman” unless
something honest is done about this fraudulent voting.
’ No faculty man serving on SFA will retain the respect
of the students unless he does all in his power to help institute
an honest, impartial, and exhaustive investigation of the In-
dependent charges. a

No student in SFA will be above the epithet “coward”
unless he aids impartially and non-politically in, the investi-
gation.

SFA is ﬁghting for its very life now.

And petty cheating, if allowed, can strangle interest in
student government even quickerthan petty politics. There
is nothing so disgusting to honest studentsas petty political
cheating. ' -

Circumstantial evidence points to the fact that there was
enough fraudulent voting to have changed the "outcome of the
election considerably. _ .
Another vote on the “Equality” amendment seems ad-
visable. - ’

SFA elections committee, and SFA itself, can easily stop

any investigation, or vote down any proposal for another pleb- .

iscite. If they do, they will only be passing the buck on to the
administration. And they will be defeating the purpose of
SFA. »
I If SFA fails to cleanse itself, then SFA will die a nat-
ural death. -

Death from dictatorship and petty machine politics.

Death from inattention to gentlemanliness and honesty.
