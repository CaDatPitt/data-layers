Professor
identifies
bones

Olivia Garber
Staﬂ" Writer

For some believers, our fates lie in
the stars, our future in the marks of
our palms. Forjeffrey Schwartz, our
identity is in our bones.

Schwartz, a Pitt anthropology
professor, has worked with the Al-
legheny County police since 1974.
The county police contact him about
three or four times per year.

He is the only anthropologist that ~

aids the county.

Aspecialist inforensic anthropol-
ogy, he assists police when they ﬁnd
human skeletons. Most recently, he
helped them idenﬁfybones foundina
Churchill, .Pa., park in mid—March.

Schwartz needs only moments
with the remains before he is able
to piece together a picture of who a
person was.

A quick perusal for the anthro-
pologist can reveal the age, sex and
height of the victim. Schwartz looks
for fungal infections, cavities and
even sinuses .— features that leave
unique marks on a person, helping
anthropologists identify him.

The shape of a person’s sinuses

T is unique, like a ﬁngerprint. If po-

lice have a lead on the identity of the
victim, comparing X-rays with the
sinuses of the remains can lead to
a positive identiﬁcation, Sch
said. '

Lifestyles can also leave traces
on bones.

Battle inthe boardroom

Devanathwas on the AcadernicAf-
fairs Committee of Student Govem-
ment Board her freshman year and
wasappointedto thechairposition the
following year. She then served as an
elected Board member for two years.

Charlie Shull, current SGB presi-
dent, has known Nila since fall 2007

when they ran on the same slate for
Board positions.

“In my experience working with
Nila, she’s always attuned herselfto be
very principled, and she moves with a
view toward absolute achievement,”
Shull said.

Shull said the two never worked
directly on a project together outside
of (ampaigning.

“She’d do what it takes to accom-
plish the job,” Shull said. “While I don’t
feel Nilahas always shown appropriate
respectforallSGB positions, especially
the president last year, I feel that she
was always working toward the bet-
terment of the studen .”

Former SGB President Kevin Mor-
rison, who clashedwith Devanathboth
privately and publicly, declinedto com-
ment on his experience working with
Devanath.

Devanath said the two did notspeak
for some time while in ofﬁce, but once

came together to ﬁght it at City Coun-

help the students,” Devanath said.
Devanathdescribedthe 2009 SGB
as a “spectrum of disagreement,” with
her at one end and Morrison at the
other.
Duringthefallbudgethearings, 14
student organizations appealed the

allocatiosng decisions they had been

given.

When the board voted on whether
the allocaﬁons committee made the
rightdecisions or not, the votewassplit
7-1 seven times, with Devanath voting

one way and the remaining board ‘ I

members the other.

Devanath said there was always
disagreement over funding the Asian
groups because there were many dif-
ferenttypes, suchas dance groups and
cultural groups. She said some board
members didn’twantto give one group
moneywhen another group requested
ﬁindingforasimjlarthing,though not

. the exactsame.

“I couldvotetowithholdthe money,
but their programs looked like they

— would attract a lot of people. My core

philosophy is that it’s the students’
money, so give it to them,” Devanath
said. «
Devanath said that problems oc-
curred when resolutions on adminis-
tration-stiident communication were
proposed after the G-20 Summit.
Devanath also voted against the

G-20 Summit-related resolution Shull ’

and former SGB member Lance Bon-
ner proposed. The resolution said the
board would work with the adminis-
tration to explain police action during
the protests. Devanath didn’t vote for
the resolution, which passed, because
it didn’t specify what how SGB would
“work’.’ with the administration.

“Some words were said that were
very unprofessional, so I left the meet-
ing,” Devanath said.

Assorted interests

Devanath hasn’t been deterred
though. She’s staying on campus and

pulling on the membrane caused the
bones to become bigger, helping
Schwartz identify the man.

Sometimes, Schwartz uses his
knowledge not only to identify bones,
but to ﬁnd them, as well.

_ When he visited Cyprus in 1971 .

and 1972, he said he learned that
a correlation exists between _dis—
turbances in vegetation and burial
sites.

Bedrock is close to the surface
in Cyprus, so the country’s vegeta-
tion tends to be small and scattered.
When Schwartz saw larger areas of
vegetation, he deduced that burial
sites must be nearby. '

The holes from the burial sites
allowed for more water retention,
thus allowing the vegetation to grow
larger. _

Schwartz used the same detec-
tive approach in a case he received
in the 1980s.

Police had captured a man sus-
pected of 24 murders, and part of
the man’s plea bargain required him
to disclose the location of two of his
victims.

The man directed police to a pine

grove. Schwartz, along with officers

and body—snifﬁng dogs scoured the’

area for remains. .
As the sun set, Schwartz noticed

V something odd in the grove. In the

middle of the pine grove appeared a
line of three maple saplings, growing
from a depression in the ground.

Jeffrey Schwartz:

“As many years as I have been in
the morgue and seen dead people, it
still gets. me,” he said. _

He recalled one case inwhich he
helped police identify a woman.

The case left a strong mark on '

back of the neck.

He said he can discover general

the neck and is the only bone in the

human body not connected to any,

other bones via joints. If someone
has been strangled, usually the hyoid
bonewill break, although that doesn’t
always happen, Schwartz said.

' Dr. Abdulrezak Shakir,.associ-
ate medical examiner for Allegh-
eny County, said Schwartz helps the
county by evaluating the evidence
that remains on the bones. V

Schwartz can help determine with
what instrument injuries are consis-

with a sharp blade or a dull blade,

Shakir said. ‘ ‘

Police call Schwartz to ﬁnd skel-

The police once called him be-
cause a citizen had given them a bag
of bones. The citizen reported that
there was a human vertebra among
the bones. , —

The human vertebra turned out
to be the ankle of a cow, and the rest
of the “bones” were rocks.

any responsibilityto nuanced argument or soundreason. ~ _ .

That Howardbestows the title of“some citizens” on the32 millionuninsuredAmericans who would be helpedby the

General.Tom Corbett’s motive for ﬁling suit against the federal government.

The most plausible explanation, that the suit is in fact a political stunt, is never answered. Rather; Howard offers

To the Editor,

I am writing in regard to the March 29 article “Pitt Pride Week kicks off.” Speciﬁcally, I would like toaddress the
RainbowAlliance’sDragShow. . ‘

Dragis not nearlyasprevalentintiie gay communityasthe RainbowAlliance would have you believe. Itis onthe fringes,
it is the extremes and it is not at all an indication of the community as awhole. It is merely the most ostentatious. I

Particularly troublesome for me was sophomore Aron Stone’s quote that said “Some people have no idea who gay
people are, or they deﬁne them through stereotypes. Pride Week shows them we’re normal people just like they are.”

Weareindeednormalpeoplejustliketheyare,butP1ideWeekisnotrepresentativeofthat.L -

Pride Week, as run by the Rainbow Alliance, shows the largely untrue stereotypes that people already associate with
the LGBT community. .

What’s more, they have even added another stereotypical event, the DragRaoe. '

Iknowthiswill not change the Rainbow.Al1iance’s policy of promoting gay stereotypes, butI urge students to realize
that, on the whole, gaypeople behave inaperfectiy normal manner, andlhope the Pitt communitywilltake Pride Week

MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Sloshy froshies, too much is never enough

I see your freshman 15 and raise you a sophomore 60.

 
  
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

With the advent of springtime here
on our fair campus, you have un-
doubtedly begun to think about de-
veloping the base tan and rippling
hard body needed for success at
the beach.

Unfortunately, if you’re like most
of your peers —— an estimated 76
percent of them, according to
always—authoritative Wikipedia —
you’ve gained the dreaded fresh-
man 15. '

Now, far from concentrating
your precious energies on the se-
lection of a suitable swimsuit, you’re
left ﬁguring out how to stave off or
reverse the bloat and decay that
resulted from one too many extra-
syrupy pancake breakfasts, lunches
_and dinners.

Well, you came to the right spot,
because today’s Moustache Column
of America constitutes the Rosetta
Stone needed to solve your little
problem. .

You probably believe the best

thing to do now is to undertake a

program of intense physical exer-

cise. Perhaps you’ve even consid-

ered joining this hot, new univer-

s sity exercise group you’ve heard so
much about.

Friend, let us tell you something:

are.

There are plenty of do-gooders
and try—harders writing for Amer-
ica’s top checkout line tabloids who
will tell you that you deserve some
other kind of body, but a slightly
plumper physique has lots to rec-

able past you can exaggerate and
idealize.

Prom queen? Abercrombie &
Fitch model? Humor columnist?
Now is the time to relive the dreams
that never came true.

Second, you can embrace a new

Abercrombie & Fitch model? Humor
columnist? Now is the timeto relive the
dreams that nevercame true.  

Dropping barbells with 15—pound

bumper plates, performing ring A

l dips, doing air squats in weighted
vests and swingingkettlebells isn’t
the answer. '

No, all that program would do
is get you back in shape in no time
ﬂat — and getting back in shape
is just another way of hiding from
the truth.

See, this freshman 15 is who you

ommend toit. »

First, now that you look different
from the way you did in high school,
you’ve got an appropriate frame of
reference for your glory days.

Knee injuries sustained during
junior year of high school football
— when you were certainly going
tobe all—state or at least all—county
—. aside, becoming out of shape is
an awesome way to develop a us-

role. Ever watch one of those hot
college comedies? There’s always
a choice part in those for a chubby,
sassy girlfriend or a fat, obnoxious
roommate.

These. people might not get
the partners of their dreams, but
their frolicsome antics never fail to
steal the show. So answer this: Why
wouldn’t you want to be a show-
stealer, friend?

>7 Finally, the freshman 15 is a rite
of passage, akin to catching your
galpal ﬂirting on Facebook with
your best pal or watching ‘-‘The
Boondock Sain ” for the 50th time.
It marks the boundary that sepa-
rates exciting adulthood — withits
9-to-5 workdays and khaki pants
that have a loosewaist — from the
marathon sleeping sessions and

drunken bacchanalia of dreary’

adolescence.

Now that you’ve put on the avoir-
dupois like nobody’s business, aren’t
you ready for the big time? Aren’t
you ready to be a grown-up?

As always, you can thank us later,
kind reader.

ér and operator of the Moustache

muscle—building goals and achieve
the body of your ﬁiends’ sweetest

MUSIC on CAMPUS

 

Folk music series

Calliope and the University Library System present the Emerging Legends Series.

Jordan Streussnig
Staﬁ Writer

» There’s a new venue in town, and

it’s right on Pitt’s campus.

A recent collaboration between
Pittsburgh’s folk music society Cal-
liope and Hillman Library will
transform Cup & Chaucer Café into
a folk music .venue once or twice
per month.

The quiet concerts are part
of the Emerging Legends Series,
which is the brainchild of Uni-
versity librarian Rush Miller. The
series facilitates performances
by local folk musicians in the Cup
& Chaucer Café, located on the
ground ﬂoor of Hillman Library.

“The Hillman Library is a per-
fect setting for this series in that
a large part of Calliope’s mission
is to educate the public about tra-
ditional music, and presenting the
series in an academic environment

iPad’s release hasn’t subdued debates

 
    
 

Donald Campbell
Columnist

The release of the iPad on Saturday»

hasn’t quelled the often contentious
debates that Apple raised when
it announced the iPad back in late
January.

Since then, many writers and
techies praised the iPad’s innovative
design and expressed excitement
over the concept of atouchpad device
running the light iPhone operating
system.

Other authors, myself included,
brought the iPad’s ﬁxture position in
the garne of computer gadgets into
question.

‘ Techies across the country are still questioning the future of the iPad in the computer world._

The big debate over the iPad is
whether the new device has a market-
able place in the world of consumer
electronics has subsided, only to be
replaced with a signiﬁcantly more
existential battle.

Many bloggers and columnists
are questioningwhetherthey’re okay
with Apple’s control over the devel-
opment and dissemination stages of
the iPad. As with many arguments,
the reality is a bit more middle-of-
the-road than many would have you
believe.

The entire argument lies around
the fact that, without some rather
clever measures, a stock iPad cannot
have just any piece of code orprogram
loaded on it. Software mustbe written

usingApple’s development tools and
approvedbefore the Apple Apps store
will “officially” distribute the software
to iPad users. Apple can apply certain
degrees of censorship, such as block-
ing applications whose functionality
or subject matter is problematic.

The programmer does not have
accesstothe ﬁmdamental underlying
system of the iPad, as aprogrammer
would in aWmdows, Linux or Macin-
tosh OS X general-purpose computer.
Programmers are therefore limited
to referencing the iPad’s features
through a set of Apple—controlled
tools called a Software Development
Kit, or SDK.

ALBUM REVIEW

Mash-up album leeches off
the talent of other artists

Kieran Layton
A8‘E Editor

Jason Derulo

Jason Derulo

Rocks Like:_]ay Sean, Chris Brown
Grade: C+

son den]

It’s usually not a good sign when an -

artist’s lead single becomes a hit not be-
cause of its originality or admirable dis-
play of musicianship, but rather because
it samples a song from a much more tal-
ented artist. .

Forjason Derulo, that song is the chart-
topper “Whatcha Say,” and that sample
is Imogen Heap’s indie—electronic classic
“Hiderand Seek.”

Fortunately for Derulo, however," his
self—titled debut album enters the music
scene offering catchy and well—produced

 

  

— if not necessarily innovative — pop
R&B tracks. _

Fans of the -leadsingle will- undoubt-
edly find more to like here. While none
of the other songs will ingrain themselves
so deeply that you can’t help .but uncon-
sciously hum them at random intervals

"throughout the day, almost all are pleas-

ant, and the good news foriDerulo is that

they all sound like they could wind up

on the radio and become
hits. I I

' His second single “In

’ My Head” is one such

track, and I would argue

that it’s a better main-

“_Whatcha Say,” if only
because it lets the listener
know that Derulo does not
necessarily need to rely
on samples for success
—— just a good produc-
tion team. But hey, what
pop star doesn’t? Plus, at
least he writes most of his
own music. *

“Blind” and “Queen
of Hearts” borrow more
heavily from the R&B side
of the musical spectrum
than the other tracks and
prove that the artist has
some degree of versatility, something that
I would love to-see him explore further on
an upcoming album.

So while the album is generally enjoy-
able, there is ultimately little memorable
content, especially in a rad_io age in which
every other song sounds likeit could fit in
among these tracks.

Perhaps it’s onlya trend (and at this

point, I hope it is), but in the future, Derulo s
will need to find something to separate A

himself from the rest of the pack if he
wants another “Whatcha Say”-sized hit. .

Musicians ready to move in after renovations

The new musical program willkick into full swing once Cup £5’ Chaucer is mademore music- friendly over the summer. 

Folk music 4 8

a library setting —— compliments
the series perfectly,” Patricia Tan,-
ner, executive director of Calliope,
said.

i Miller said the idea to create
some sort of music program has
been brewing in his head since Cup
& Chaucer was added to the library
eight years ago.

i As a board member of“Calliope,
Miller proposed the idea to Tanner,
and then the idea took off.

“I think it’s great tolhavefall 

these wonderful performers-for
people to enjoy free of -charge.
These same musicians are playing
in concerts not free to the public,”_
Miller said. “The whole goal of the
program is just to make the café

more welcoming, not so quiet and

boring.” *
But students don’t have to wor-

ry about the performances,inter- '

rupting their studies.
“We want to provide casual
background music, not to be

thought of as necessarily a concert, .

that people can listen to as they

, come and go,” Miller said.

Miller also mentioned plans
to renovate the café this summer
to create a more music-friendly
setting with a bit more space for
listeners.

“I think we will attract more
people when the renovations are
complete, and I want to expand

__the progranystart to include more N
"genres of music,” he said; “Every-

thing from. classical to who-knows-
what .:._.but it can’t be too loud.”

This past week, Pitt chemis-
try professor Steve Weber and
Pitt English professor Phil Smith
rocked Cup & Chaucer with their
own stylings of some classic folk
tunes.

The duo didea Bob Dylan cover -

and gave renditions of older songs
such as “Duncan and Brady” that
are so ‘steeped in tradition that they
have no known original artist.

Smith and Weber also played
“One Meatball,” originally per-
formed in the 1930s byjosh White.

Rush Miller:

cians had not joined forces as a

consistently performing duo. We-
ber is a member of another band,

The whole goal of the program
isijust to make the café more

The song details the despair of one
manso poor he went to a restau-
rant asking only for what he could
afford: one meatball.

Tanner asked Weber and Smith,

members of the board of directors '

at Calliope, to play lastjanuary at
Cup 8: Chaucer. ~

1 Though they had known eac
other for a while, the two musi-

gwelcoming, not so quiet and
boring.      

the Monongahela Sheiks, and
Smith, Smokestack Lightning.
The ﬁrst show was such a suc-
cess that Weber and Smith were
asked to return to the café — an

invitation -that propelled them to -

continue practicing together.

“I like the idea of creating social .

space within thelibrary. It makes

the library a more interesting en— —

vironment for thoughtful activity,”
Weber said. ' 
Though perhaps not in agree-

‘ment about the most interesting

subject matter academically, Smith
and Weber can come to terms on

. one thing —— that the tradition of

folk music is alive and well in Pitts-
burgh, and they each hope to do his
part in keeping it that way.

“I became interested in folk
music during the ’6os. We all
liked rock ’n’ roll, but there was
something stupid and commercial
about it,” Smith said. “Folk mu=
sic is very socially conscious and
thoughtful, and during the Civil
Rights Movement and Vietnam,
this music seemed to address itself
in socially aware ways.

“The artists,” he said, “were
sort of generational models.”

The Wreckids will perform
the-next show at Cup & Chaucer
Wednesday, April 14, from 6 to 7
p.m.

STAR PLAYERS

Pitching duet barreling through Big East

Two of Pitt’s pitchers, Corey Baker and Nathan Hood, are among the league ’s best in wins and strikeouts. rs

Alex Oltmanns
Staffwri ter

While they have taken different
paths to get there, Pitt pitchers
Corey Baker and Nathan Hood
now stand together atop the Big
East.

Ranking No. 1 and No. 2 in in-
nings pitched in the Big East, Hood
and Baker helped lead the team to
its best start since 2002.

Baker and Hood also rank ﬁrst
and fourth, respectively, in wins.

Baker, a junior, has been a
starting pitcher since his fresh-
man year at Pitt, when he ﬁnished
third on the team in strikeouts that
season. Last year, he lead the team
in wins.

Yet, Hood has taken a much
different route to his top-seated
standing.

Now a senior, he spent his
ﬁrst‘ two years of college playing
at North Central Texas Commu-
nity College, where he was known
more as a hitter before transfer-

ring to Pitt last year.

He played primarily in the out-
ﬁeld for the Panthers last season,
pitching only 16 innings all year
as he dealt with a nagging elbow
injury.

Nathan Hood:

He knows whatit takes to
pitch in the Big East.

Even with those few innings of
Big East pitching experience, head
coach Joe Jordano knew what he
had in Hood and approached him
at the end of last season, letting
him know that he would be one of
the go-to pitchers this spring.

“Towards the end of last year
and into the summer, he checked
in on me a few times and pretty
much told me that he was going
to need a big effort off the mound
from me,” Hood said. “I know I
had the stuff to do it, and Coach

1 Fordham. during spring break,

just gave me an opportunity.”
His “stuff” has been almost
unhittable so far this year, as his
three-pitch arsenal of a fastball,
slider and split—change have been
baffling hitters all season. Up to

this point, he’s met Coach Jorda-
no’s expectations, going 5-0 with
a 3.10 ERA and is third in the Big
East in strikeouts with 47.

Hood said his best start of the
season came in a 13-0 win over

during which he threw eight shut-
out innings while giving up only
two hits.

The pitcher directly behind
him in the Big East in strikeouts:
Corey Baker.

Big East in innings pitched.

to become one of the premier
pitchers in the league. He’s 6-0
with a 3.20 ERA, but with his ex-
perience, he knows the season is
far from over.

With Hood already tripling his
inning total from last season, they
know it’s important to keep their
arms fresh. Baker’s learned that
from ﬁrst—hand experience.

“Last year, I threw a lot of in-
nings too, and I kind of got tired

there in the end,” Baker said. “I’ve-

done a pretty good job of keeping

up with my running, conditioning '

and lifting in the offseason and
taking that into the season.”

Hood credits team trainer Tim
Beltz for helping him, Baker and
all the other pitchers with their
conditioning, as they both cited
that lifting between starts has
helped build their arm strength.

For Hood it’s just been a mat-
ter of training all year to reach
this point.

“During fall practice, I pitched
a lot more than I did last year, so
that helped me out a lot,” Hood'*4
said.

With Baker being the Big East
veteran of the two aces and learn-
ing what it takes to compete not
just physically but mentally at that
level, he’s helped Hood adjust to 3
the grind of facing some of the top
hitters in the country three or four
times per start.

“He knows what it takes to
pitch in the Big East,” Hood said.

3 The Pitt baseball team ended its re-

cord-settingwinningstreak by losing
to Rutgers last weekend.

Pitt (19—6, 4-2 Big East) lost two
in the three-game series against the
Scarlet Knights (14-11, 5-1 Big East).

The Panthers lost the ﬁrst game
9-8. Junior Corey Baker started for
the Panthers, recording a no-deci-
sion, afterpitching seven innings and
giving up four runs, on 12 hits, while
striking out three.

The Panthers went ahead in the

vid Chester. Scoring on the play was
junior left ﬁelderjohn Schultz.

Rutgers battled back, tying the
score inthe bottom half ofthe fourth
on two leadoff singles, asacriﬁce bunt
and atwo-run single by Russ Hopkins
to center ﬁeld.

Pitttook the lead back in the ﬁfth,
on a two—out single by senior short-
stop Danny Lopez, bringing junior

the score to 3-2.

The Panthers extended the lead ,

to 5-2 in the top of the sixth. After a
leadoif single by juniorthird baseman
Joe Leonard, Chester homered for a
second time on the day, taking the
pitch out over the wall in left-center.

“[Chester] took a great offensive
approach all weekend,” head coach

Joejordano said. “Both ofhis homer-
uns would have been out of any park
in the country. He crushed both.”

Pitt extended the lead once again
in the top of the seventh, scoring
three more runs, making the score
8-2. Theseruns came from RBIs from
Leonard, redshirt junior catcher Ke-
vanSmith and juniorsecond baseman
Travis Whitmore.

In the bottom of the inning, Rut-
gers cut the Panthers’ lead to 8-4,
after loading the bases with no outs.
Baker was able to get out of the in-
ning after Rutgers scored two runs
on an RBI double play and a double
to left ﬁeld.

Pitt went to the bullpen in the
bottom of the eighth, when Baker

loaded the bases with no outs. The
Panthers turned to redshirt fresh-
man, Ray Black. Black was able to get
out of the inning unscathed, after re-
cordingthree straight outs, including
a Strikeout.

In the bottom of the ninth, Rut-
gers loaded the bases again, this time
with one out. ~

Pitt turned to redshirt freshman
J.R. Leonardi to close out the ninth.
After consecutive singles, the score
was cut to 8-7.

With two outs and runners on sec-
ond and third, Lopez ﬁelded a ground
ball, but the throw was off and Rut-
gers scored the winning run.

“It was very difﬁcult. We played
fairly well for 8.1 innings, and we just
did not close it out,”Jordano said after
the game. “Give credit to Rutgers,

though. They got timely hits and_

made the plays. It was an emotional
loss, tough to swallow.”

The loss ended Pitt’s record win-
ning streak at 11.

In game two, Pitt was unable to
battle back from the previous day’s
tough loss, losing 6-1. Taking the

loss for the Panthers was sophomore
Matt Iannazzo, who gave up ﬁve runs
(three earned) over six and one-third

“We simply did not play well in

_ game two. Matt Iannazzo pitchedwell

enough to win, and he kept us in the
game. We were just off at the plate,”
Jordano said.

- In game three, the Panthers were
able to salvage awininthe series, ona
rally in the top of the ninth inning.

“[It was a] huge win for us, we

' could have packed it in when we

went down 3-1, then went down again
5-4. But we kept ﬁghting and came
through at the end,”]ordano said.

“Nate Hood pitched a phenom-
enal game for us, and ]_.R.' Leonardi
was as good in relie ,” he said.

Down 3-0 in the top of the third
inning, the Panthers narrowed the
marginto two runs, on singles by red-
shirt junior center ﬁelder Zach Dug-
ganand by Schultz. Duggan scored on
an RBI groundout by Leonard.

The Panthers were able to tie the
score at 3-3 in the top of the ﬁfth in-

ning. After leadoff singles by Lopez-

and Schultz, Chester hit a single to
send Lopez home. Schultz was able
to reach home on a wild pitch.

In the top of the seventh, the Pan-
thers took their ﬁrst lead of the game‘
at 4-3, on an RBI single .by Smith,
scoring Lopez.

After Rutgers regained the lead .

with two runs of its own in the bottom
of the inning, the Panthers tied the
game again in the eighth at 5-5.

After a walk and stolen base by -

Duggan, Lopez connected with atwo-
out double, scoring Duggan.

In the top of the ninth, the Pan-
thers were able to ﬁnishvthe come-

back. A leadoff single by Leonard and-

two errors by the Rutgers inﬁeld al-
lowed Pitt to score pinch runner Evan
Oswald.

With the lead at 6-5, Pitt was
able to close out the game with
three consecutive outs, recorded by
Leonardi.

The Panthers will play at Akron
and Kent State duringthe weekbefore
an important series at home against
Louisville, the defending Big East
champions.

“'I'0NY’S TAKE

Farewell, Mellon Arena  

The Igloo takes its final bow, The Pitt News ‘reminisces

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

 

» For those of you from outside the Pittsburgh

area, the word “igloo” mightnot invoke much
emotion. But to some Pittsburghers, the mere
mention of the Igloo can trigger a smile.

_ The Igloo, formally known as Mellon Arena,
will take its ﬁnal bow Thursday as it hosts its
last regular season NHL game when the New
York Islanders visit the Penguins.

Then known as the Civic Arena, its 1961

opening started a new era in arena engineering.
‘ The spherical dome roof opened — the ﬁrst of
its kind to do so.

The design was ﬁt for some incredible con-
certs.

The roof was opened when The Beatles
played there in 1964, which was probably a
good thing, because the screams would have
blown the roof off, anyway.

Courtesy Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh

Sadly, the now-obsolete Igloo will be vacant
next season, as the Penguins move across the
street to the state-of-the—art Consol Energy
Center.

Sure, the new arena is sorely needed, but
what makes Mellon Arena outdated is also
what makes it so damn special. l

There is literally no legroom in any of the
seats. I’ve been_in coach seats on airplanes
with more space than the Igloo. But that’s what
makes a game there so great. Sure, your knees
rest on the seat in front of you, but every seat

. , .

is close to the action.
Even if you sit at the top of the arena, dan-

gling from the ceiling in the F level, you are still _

pretty much over top of the goal and can still
read each player’s jersey.
O’ I When the upper levels were constructed
to add more seating capacity, it created some
limited-view seats in the lower levels,‘including
a few seats directly behind poles.

I sat in such aseat for a game. A steel beam

Igloo < 16

This happened to me last
week. .

Sidney Crosby scored his
second goal of the game against
‘Toronto and I kicked my beer

' over in jubilation. I immediately

to me, but he didn’t care. He un-
derstood, and he then went on to

spilled his beer on people.
, We then started talking about
._ how the new arena will have cup
A holders in the seats, which will be
nice, but it won’t have the same
friendly feel as the Igloo._
I’m sure Consol Energy Center
will be spectacular, but it is hardly
unique. '

was directly in my lap. My legs werepretty E
~ much straddling it. Ihad to use the beam to lift

myself out of my seat every time the Penguins
scored. ' I

Yes, it was armoying,‘butI could still watch
the entire game. I just had to keep moving my
body from side to side.

I quickly made a new friend, because ev-
ery time the puck went to the far side, I had
to pretty much lean over her seat. She was a

season ticket holder, so she understood my _

predicament. .
That is one of the greatest features of the

_ Igloo: Itbrings peopletogether,bothphysically -

and emotionally. , »

There are no cup holders in any of the seats,
so you have to set your drinks on theground
by your feet — which is pretty dangerous,.con-
sidering that in hockey, a goal canbe scored at
any moment. — I ,

So excitement—fueled spills happen quite
often, and when they do, it is common for
strangers sitting next to each other to become
friends. A

has the same type of design: a giant
building with a fantastic glass facade. New]er—

A sey, Kansas City and Raleigh all have arenas like

this. Now Pittsburgh will be added to the list.
No longer will Pittsburgh’s venue be one of

a kind. It won’t even be the only of its kind in .
_ Pittsburgh —— the Petersen ‘Events Center has

the same style: I’ve yet to see the inside of the
new arena, but hopefully, they will somehow
manage to keep the cozy feeling of Mellon
Arena alive in the Consol Energy Center.

I’ve sat in the upper level of the Prudential , I

Center in Newjersey, and it was not veryﬁin —-
not only because the Penguins lost to the Devils
for theﬁfth straight time, but alsobecause Ifelt
like Iwas a mile away from the action — and I
was in the front of the upper level.

Even if the Consol Energy Center manages '

to have a cozy feel to it, it will never be like
the Igloo. There are only two regular season
games left.

Pittsburgh fans need to cherish Mellon
Arena while it lasts, because next year, the
Penguins will no longer have a unique build-

_ ing in which to play.
