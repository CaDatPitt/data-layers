crease ﬁnancial support.

SGA erect a panther on the lawn
of the Student Union with.so1ici-

President Bert O’Malley, Arts
’59, reported that the chief ac-
complishment of the SGA Fall
Retreat was the grasping of the
idea that the Student Govern-
ment is a poizcy-making body
with unlimited jurisdiction.

Woody Turner, Arts ’61, moved
that the student group arrange
for discussion sessions set by a
committee subject to the approval
of SGA.

He also moved that SGA con-
gratulate the committee respon-
sible for the Pep Rally on Fri-
day evening and all students
making it a success.

Both motions were passed.

A motion proposed by Kent Jar-
rell, Arts "60, that SGA direct
delegates to the Student Affairs
Committee to ask that SGA par-
ticipte in the allocation of funds
to student organizations was pass-
ed. ‘ '

The budget dated June 30, 1958,
prepared by Kent Jarréll, was ap-
proved. .

Placement Publication

Shows Engineer Need

The College Placement Annual hasrevealed this week
that no let up in demand for college trained engineers will

occur in 1959.

More than 1600 ﬁrms have listed their employment needs
in the Annual, and over 1000 of these are seeking engineers.
The demand of ﬁrms seeking mechanical engineers remains

the highest for the second con-¢

secutive year.

Almost 800 ﬁrms are "seeking
applicants with mechanical engi-
neering degrees. Following in or-
der of company interest are elec-
trical and electronic engineers
sought by 706 companies, sales
personnel needed by 591, and ac-
countants by 513.

Industrial engineers are need-
ed by 481 organizations, chemi-_
cal engineers by 464, business
administrators by 427, and
chemistsof all types sought by
396.

The Placement Annual is pub-
lished on a non proﬁt basis by
the College Placement Council.
This year’s edition contains more
than 120 job classiﬁcations, both
technical and non-technical.

The publication is designed by
placement ofﬁcers to assist gradu-
ating seniors in procuring posi-
tions in their respective ﬁelds.

Seniors are coached in matters
of dress, conduct, and self ap-
praisal, in preparation for meet-
ing the recruiters who will visit

their campuses before next
June. ‘

The Placement Council esti-
mated that job opportunities

would equal if not exceed those of
the past year. The most recent re-

‘The Pitt News has embarked upon a program to im-

S prove its communications in the Pitt campus community.

_ . This week marks the beginning of a two—month trial of
three editions per week. Its success will depend. upon vari-
ous factors. One, our own efﬁciency. Two, ﬁnancial support.

’And three, the reception _of our program by the student

body. - " A
The new deadlines for news will mean adjustment of

' procedures by publicity chairmen of various groups. It can

also mean better coverage of news as it happens.

_ This seems as good a time as any to state our role in
the expanding University.-The 'P_i_tt News is not a corpora-
tion newssheet. It is not our obligation to support every ac-
tion of the University administration. No_r is it our pre-

rogative to criticize unjustly or merely for the sake jof'mak—

ing noise.
It ‘must serve the student body. The views of students

' are given a thorough airing in this newspaper, let the chips

fall as they may. * -
Second, we must present the ever_yday information

about University happenings-and this means the whole

University, not just the School of the Liberal Arts, but all
the other undergraduate, graduate and professional schools.
_Our “News Bulletin” is to convey messages to individ-
uals--concerning organization meetings, and other informa-
tion of interest only to a limited group of people.
, Third, in a way, we must represent the faculty which

has no publication’ of its own to include its problems, desires,

occasional disagreements with administrative policy.
It’s up to the Pitt News to seek out these opinions and
set "them into print.
‘ Last, there is -the area of public service which we are
beginning through the co—sponsoring of two leading political

‘ candidates in Midday Series programs in October. Other

features outside the printed word should be forthcoming
through the sponsorship of the Pitt News. _
All this, needless to say, is an oversimpliﬁcation, but it

- should suﬂice to give some idea of the scope and breadth of

news coverage and service which we attempt to offer. I
, If, at the end, of the two months, we feel that we have
not been supcessful in publishing three times per week, we

.will be honest with our readers and revert to serving the

University family only twice a’ week .
However, if we feel that we have done_ a suitable job
and receive a favorable opinion from you, the readers, we
will then ask the proper sources for the funds that will en-
able us to ﬁnish the year with three editions each week.

Principled Or Survival    

, By Millard Amdur
The U. S. diplomacy force has put itself into a
predicament that has estranged our allies over ‘fa

principle.”

Just who are we defending? The Chinese Na-

tionalists and what an ambigu-
ous term this has becpme. We
are defending Generalissimo
Chiang Kai Shek and company.
Now if the Generalissimo at
least appreciated what the U. S.
is doing to preserve his decadent
regime, the administration might

claim the humanitarian aspect j’
, of their venture into the ridicu-

lous.

Stubborn Chiang
But Chiang, in his only open

press conference of recent years, has. declared that
China will not, under anyconditions, accept de-
militarization of the off-shore islands. This weak-
ens what few bargaining points the U. S. had in

Warsaw. .

George Yeh, new ambassador to the U. S. from
of China ‘asked and blustered
through a one-half hour panel show, “Face the,Na-
tion,” on which he was unwilling to answer most
of the questions the panelists threw at him.
Mr. Yeh was also quite concerned about the ,

great principle they were ﬁghting for. He said that
Red China could not be trusted to respect any

the “Republic”

» agreement.

‘C When asked about Warsaw ‘and the possibility
of reaching an agreement, the Chinese ambassador
claimed that China had no idea what the U. s. was’
doing there since they (the government) had not

been informed.

Confident Brucker

trip to the Far East_ and claimed the blockade was

eﬁectively broken.

Over 90,000 Chinese soldiers are on Quemoy,
enough to hold it without‘ outside help, according

. to Brucker. He is also quite certain that the Chinese
Communists do not have nuclear weapons. The
Chinese story of their position is far from so con-

B u t perhaps
it is incorrect to '
say that he has

since- both his
name and face ‘
are still public-

would be better
to mention his

No, he has not slain any giants,

much more perceptive, profound,

about the motivating force be-

there was no force as we should
like to think of it, that is, a re-

What there was, was an idea,
originating somewhere within
the Air Academy, to do some-
thing for the beneﬁt of its young
pilots. Something ‘to ﬁll them

with pride, conﬁdence, and in-
spiration.

Now it is quite ﬁtting that
such an idea should have arisen
in this new institution. For the

that the  S. had not given the Nationalists the

Nevertheless, both Chiang and Yeh say China

Chinese having to show this restraint to keep the

swers to too many such ques-
tions, the Air Force ﬁgures he
spends too much time on culture
and not enough on doing. He is,
according to the Academy reg-
istrar, flunked.”

That’s a nice healthy practice.
After all, what can an apprecia-

What did men like these know

I was surprised to read that the
University may have a new ‘Na-

my mind. ‘

First, how much will the Uni-

cost of construction? Second, if
the University is willing to‘ invest
money in a new Nationality Room,
should not some other Pittsburgh

Panthers Catch
Bucs' ‘Disease’

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

Despite the fact that the autumnal equinox occurred
around here a week ago yesterday, Fall never actually be-
gins in Pittsburgh until the_ Pirates have ﬁnished their
season. _ _ 

‘There were quite a few people in the little world of
Oakland who thought Fall would start about ten days later
than usual this year, but the Braves came to Nature's rescue

_ and made sure the Pirates would entertain no post-season

visitors. Despite the failure of the Bucs to bring oﬂf asport
miracle, by winning the’ pennant, they did fascinatingly well
in ﬁnishing ‘a rather close second.

The success (which did spoil" many Pittsburgh “rock—
hunting” fans) of the summer professionals may be contagi-
ous, as witness the fast start of our fall amateurs, the Pan-
thers. With a couple of convincing wins over foes from each
coast, the football squad show signs of making the nation’s
sporting attention remain right here.

* * * *

If the unorthodox comparison between the winning Pir-
ates and Panthers is carried along further, some interesting

_ conjecture is produced. It is generally agreed that the base-

ballers succeeded this year because of experience combined
with youthgand a lack of injuries. ’

The defense tightened; the hitting heightened; then, the

V pitching improved. With the reinforcement provided by a

few new faces, the club became world-beaters. The team
had “jelled.” The absence of injuries was indeed fortuitous.
No other N. L. club muddled through the schedule with as
few hurts as-the‘ Pirates.

The two quick wins of our team can be attributed to the
same factor which boosted the Bucs——experience and youth.
The veteran backﬁeld and line is playing together for the
second season. Their replacements stream in from the now-
celebrated sophomore and under—rated junior classes. To-
gether they present a fearsome problem in sheer manpower
for the eight future opponents to overcome.

* * =l= #4

The second factor—injuries—will determine, as usual,

‘V the overall success of the 1958 season. Already we have been

attacked by the damage which results from hard—contact

C football. With Kaliden, Toncic, Haley, Rathi, and Merkovsky

unavailable because of various accidents, the coaching staff
must be uneasily recalling last year.

Along with all the other things which went awry dur-
ing the ’57 season, injuries to the, backs and the middle of
the line proved to be an insurmountable handicap. It is,
therefore, safe to say that the remainder of this season will
be pleasant only if the parade of injuries is halted. “How?”
you ask. A tricky question, defying undergraduate answer.
We‘ can only be sure that Trainers Howard Waite and Roger
McGill will have adequate supplies of balm and soothing

; words come Saturday’s Minnesota tussle.

The Bunyans from the North Woods have never been
noted for physical or mental gentlity. In fact, such Gophers
as Leo Nomellini and Clay Tonnemaker established a tough
tradition which is still encouraged by Coach Murray
Warmath.

The brittle Panthers are out to snare the Gophers for

the ﬁrst time. With adhesive tape, prayers, and Pirate luck

they may be successful.

F rosh Grid Prospects

ppear Brighter Now

It seems that a big problem has been settled for Coach
Lou Cecconi’s.freshman football squad.

The frosh gridders, who a week earlier were rather low
on morale, were given a shot in the arm by the varsity’s 27-6
victory over UCLA and the Holy Cross win. According to
Cecconi, “The win plus the healing of all our injuries has

really boosted the morale of our:

team.” . _ .
Among the large group of non-
scholarship players many have
shown outstanding ability and are
expected to play a big part in Cec-
coni’s plans. Several of these
players showing well in pre-sea-
son practice are Lawrence Klink,
Regis Welsh, William Connelly,
James Scott, and John Rohrman.
“At this point,” said Cecconi,
“the team has started to develop
into a well—rounded unit. I’ve
been able to pick a ﬁrst team,
but of course this lineup is al-
ways subject to change. Any
player proving himself is sure
to move up to the ﬁrst team.”

The tentative starting lineup is
as follows; Quarterback—Richard
Sanker, Halfbacks—Ed Ferdinand
and John Yaccino, Fullb‘ack—
Mike Frasca, Ends—Joe Latvis
and Woody Haser, Tackles—Mark
Lenz and Phil Diemert, Guards—
Bill Fisher and Regis. Coustillac,
Center——Bob Hanak or Andrew
Kuzneski.

Haggerty Takes Lead, Amdur Right

Breakstone Still Picking Losers

 

.with a subterranean 7-8

   

David (Wait til next week)
Breakstone is still trying to ﬁgure
out what hit him over the week-
end, as he was the only Pitt News
Yogi to stay‘ below the .500 mark
at the end of the ﬁrst two weeks
of selecting winning‘ teams.

Breakstone, always the one to
be different, held tight to his losers
this. ‘past Weekend and came up
' record.

  

(Hi John) Haggerty almost pulled
the unheard of as he selected all
but two of the 15 games correctly.

The big surprise, and this no
doubt calls for a Senate investiga-
tion, was Millard Amdur’s mark
of 12-3. This puts him right in be-
hind Haggerty in the race for Yogi
honors.

 
 
     

His favorite school, Carroll, proved
victorious in the Game of the
Weak, shutting out ‘Elmhurst, 47-0.
Don Crafton, guest player, had 11
right and three wrong.

Harriers Take
Opening Meet
As Rush Wins

The Panther Harriers scored
their ﬁrst win of the 1958 season
by defeating Slippery Rock and
Oberlin in a triangular meet on
the rain-drenched Schenley course
on Saturday.

The ‘score of the meet was Pitt
22, Slippery Rock 34, and Ober-
lin 76.

-The Panthers had three men
ﬁnishing in the ﬁrst ﬁve and thus
were able to clinch the meet. Ron
Rush, John Christoff and _Dale
Fauser ﬁnished one,.two, three,
respectively‘for the Harriers.

Rush ran the 4.3 mile course in
24 minutes, nine seconds. Finish-
ing fourth and ﬁfth were Dick
Shirley and Pat Mooney of Slip-
pery Rock.

The Panthers next meet will be
Saturday against a strong West-
minster team. The meet will be
run at the Schenley course.

Injuries Keep

Toncic,Kaliden T

‘On Hopeful List  

By LARRY HAGGERTY

No, Panther football ‘team
has ever beaten Minnesota,
but the, Blue and Gold will
probably be favored to do it
in Minneapolis this Saturday
even though they might have to
operate with an 18-year-old soph-
omore at quarterback.

Third stringer Ed Sharockman,
who had to play most of the game
against Holy Cross last Saturday,’
appears at the moment to be the
likely starter at quarterback since
ﬁrst stringer Ivan Toncic and al-
ternate Bill Kaliden are nursing
injuries. ' .

“Kaliden’s injured instep is »-one-S

of those things that could make,

him a question mark all season..

One day he seems to be improv-
ing while the next day.he is limp-
ing worse than ever,” commented
Trainer Howard Waite.
Rib Cartilage Torn

“Toncic,” said Waite,. “had. a
cartilage torn from his rib cage
Saturday and had to miss the last
three quarters. He can raise his
throwing arm only with great ef-
fort and pain and his status will
be doubtful for another two to
three days.”

Two regulars, Right Guard.Ed
Michaels and Left Halfback

Dick Haley, suffered leg injuries 

in the win over Holy Cross but»
'Michaels deﬁnitely ﬁgures to
play against the Gophers.
Haley’s condition will be doubt-
ful for 36 to 48 hours.

“Even if we have to start Shar-
ockman against Minnesota, we
don't ﬁgure _ to be outclassed,"
voiced Panther coach, John,
Michelosen. “Eddie showed _a _lot
of poise against Holy Cross and
got pretty good mileage out of the
offense,” continued the Skyscraper
U. mentor.

Depth Everywhere

Thus the Panthers seem to be
three-deep in capable quarter-
backs. “As the season progresses
it looks more and more like we

have depth at every position and“-‘

this seems to be a much better
tea in thanl astseason -,kR-
team than last season,” stated line
coach Jack Wiley . '
“Before the season started we
had many doubts about the 1958
Squad but they appear to be

Pass 100% ‘Better

When the Panthers open the 1958 soccer season, they
will be ﬁelding one of the strongest passing teams in the
school’s history. Since passing is a necessity for a good soccer
team, the Panthers are hopeful of making a good showing

for themselves this year.

“This year’s'team is a hundred per cent better passing

team then last year’s
Bemis stated “When we posted
an 8 and 2 record. If this passing
continues throughout the season
our boys should play some ﬁne
soccer.”

The booters have 14 lettermen

‘ returning from last year’s squad.

They are headed by co-captains

Chuck Kane and Ron Goga. Both

Kane and Goga are boys who

never played a game of soccer be-

fore entering college.

This year they both were select-
ed by their teammates as out-
standing players at_ their positions
when they were chosen co-cap-
tains. ~

Another booter that shows
ﬁne promiseis Fernando Fabra-

— gas. He will be playing the half-
back spot which was vacated
when All-American Jerry Bres-
anelli graduated last year.

Head candidates for the front

‘ line positions this year are Lee

Goodman, Jack Horox, Bob Mur-
dock, Bob McNulty, Jason
Shrinsky, Ed Weihrauch and Kane.
Goga will be in goal while the
backs will probably be Bill Eising—
er, Fabragas, Ron Podmilsak, Ron
Wyatt and Tom Young. ‘ ‘ .

‘the opener with Akron on Oct. 4

‘wiped out now after the first
two games,” added Wiley.

Coach Michelosen is very much
concerned about the quarterback
situation for the game with the
Golden Gophers. “We must have
three signal callers available for
the game or we will be hurting in

‘this vital spot.”

To clarify just what he meant

' by hurting, Michelosen went on.
’ “If Kaliden and Toncic both miss
the game, that will leave us with‘

only two quarterbacks—name1y
Sharockman and Pete Prince.
Neither one, however, has much
experience so naturally we will
need one of the veterans to alter-

.nate with the other two.”

When Michelosen was the
backﬁeld coach for Jock Suther-
.land’s- Brooklyn Dodgers in 1940,
the National Football Leaguers
had a tackle by the name of
Bud Svendsen. The mascot of
the team happened to be Svend-
sen’s young son.

The boy grew up in Minneapolis
and attended a local high school.
He now stands 6—feet, 1-inch and
weighs 200 pounds. His name is
Bernard Svendsen and he just
happens to be the center and cap-
tain of the team that Michelosen’s
squad will face this weekend.

F or Improved Squash

“I am sure that we have the
nucleus for a much better team
this season,” stated squash coach

record of 4-1 in dual meets while‘

Knouse was right behind him with
a 3-2 chart.

Up from the freshman team to
