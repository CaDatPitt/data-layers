Centrex Phone System
to Equip Dorm Rooms-

In a recent telephone interview
' Vice Chancellor of Operations Jo-

seph Dutton further clarified the‘

new Centrex telephone system to
be installed throughout the Uni-
versity. Q
Questions _ha_d "arisen concern-
ing how students were
charged for the new system. A
flat fee will be added on to all
room bills for next year in order
to cover the system's basic cost.
Inhabitants of all dormitory
rooms _will then have two_ options
for use of the telephones which
will be placed in each room.
 it". A student may request that his
phone be equipped only to receive
incoming calls_ and’to transmit
outgoing calls within the Centrex
system only. Under this plan the
student will not pay any telephone
charges past the initial one added
to his room billl.

Telephones may also be estab-
lished for full use. that is to re-
ceive as well as transmit calls

taken. the student will receive a

regular bill from the telephone

company for all calls made.’

Dutton explained that all tele-
. phones presently connected with-
in the dormitories will be remov-
ed._ A new’University—wide tele-
phone code will replace the cur-
rent number. All telephones with-
in-the Centrex system will begin
with .the s-ame first three digits.
with the remaining four digits of
the number corresponding to what
are now referred to as extension
numbers. Each telephone within
the system will have a separate

Campus Cops Blast Security

by DENNY McMANUS

The state of campus security
and the quality of the Campus Po-
li/celforce have once again been
questioned. this time by campus
policemen.

Public outcry about the situation
has seemed to have died down
from the peek of concern reached
last fall.

On the WPGH News program
Livewire. heard Monday, Feb. 19,
at 8 p.m., two campus policemen
gave their story on what is and
isn’t being done with respect to
the Campus Police and campus
security. Fearing possible‘ re-
prisals, the officers chose to re;

main anonymous. They were re-
ferred to simply as Officer X and
Officer Y. The officers appeared
on the program to give the other
side of a story presented on an-
ther Livewire program last term
by Campus Police Superintendent
Joseph Gil. Officers X and Y felt
that they were “voicing the opin-
ion of most officers” when mak-
ing their statements and answer-

ing questions from the interview-

ers and listeners.

Discussing the ‘training of Cam-
pus Police. both officers saidthat
they were just “students looking
for. jobs“ when they joined the

force. At that time they received,

no training. merely “axgun and a

A University freshmanhas an-
nounced his attention to seek a
spot on the Republican ticket for
Pittsburgh City Council. Richard
Green. in makihg the announce-

now there is no one on the coun-
cil that can effectively represent
them." i i

‘RICHARD GREEN — Pitt freshman

Green has been a committee-

mittee at Pitt. a group that has
been working for reduced transit

opportunity to bring out the is-

- sues. It isldisgusting to kep hear-

ing the same rhetoric from allthe
candidates.” Green says, “I have
a carteblanche from the party to
say anything I,believe.” The Re-
publican endorsements are due
in a few weeks, and he plans to
run in the primary Whether he
receives one or not. l’

The primary. motivation for
Green's candidacy is what he, sees

as a failure by the present council"

and mayor to represent the peo-
ple in a direct fashion. “The pre-

- sent administration is no better,

than the ‘last. The Councilmen
' seem to be strictly par,\t-time.
Their doors are not open to the
publicff he says. ~
Green admits that l\/Iayor Pete
' Flaherty has had some success in
cleaning up the city‘s administra-
tive process. He is less impress-

ed with Flahertys austerity pro-

gram. Of it he says:'“Anybody
can reduce taxes by reducing
,services. There has to'"be a trade-
off there." J 

‘He is less respectful of the main
Democratic challenger to Flaher-
ty, Councilman Richard Caligiuri.
“Caligiuri did not do enough while
in council to justify his arrogant
position now,’T Green insists. “If
Caligiuri gets elected and graft
and corruption start up again, the
city could see a Republican mayor
in four years./”

Alsodrawing fire from Green is
the Skybus Early Action Program.
He thinks that the Skybus route
should run from East Pittsburgh
‘through Oakland to the downtown

area. He says. “This isfthe most
heavily populated area of the
city. Anyway. the South Hills al-
ready h-as the best transit system
in the area with their trolleys.”

Remuneration Issue

by JOHN POULIN

,In response to a current inquiry‘
into the usage of student activities
fee money to remunerate stu-
‘dents: in campus organizations.
-Terri Weaver. chairman of the
Remunerations ..B_oard. has at-
tempted to_cla_rify some misun-
derstandings which she feels are
the roots of the issue.

Weaver explained the the Re-

- munerations Board originated last

summer after Student Govern-
ment pointed out the inconsisten-
cy of having paid positions in
some campus organizations while
others were non—salaried. Dean
Moye of Student Affairs then as-
signed a task force to formulate
a policy on student remuneration.

The disappearing task force

‘concluded that the remuneration

of students for their services was

~ in order, Weaver said, because of

the time which some organiza-
tions required, their was often no

‘opportunity to work on a part-time

job as do many students. And in
some instances, it was found that
the activity involved ‘additional
personal expnses for which there
had not been reimbursement.
After investigation of several
possible sources of funds. the stu-
dent activities fee was found ‘to
be the only one which- was feasi-
ble. Weaver said. The Universi-
ty‘s budget was found too tight to
allow direct funding. and it was
thought that compensation in the
form of a scholarship would be.

Intimate Courses Addedi  

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

' A As a "continuation of past poli-
cy” in the History Department.
several “small courses which will
facilitate personal contact be-
tween professors and students"
will be offered this fall. accord-
ing to Dr. Van Beck ‘Hall of the
department.

Hall explained that the new
courses. some “entirely innova-
tive" and others the result of "re-
vamping established offerings."
reflect ‘the departments policy
over the last several years of

' eliminating formal requirements.

honor programs_and the like.

‘Among the seminars that the
department will offer are Andrew

. Mellon Professor Michael Cher-.

niavsky’s Soviet Social History.
This course will deal with the re-
formation of culture in- the USSR
since the/revolution in 1917, in’-
cluding’the changing. role of wom-
en, attitudestowards work, -and

iy,Campi1s Security on

‘ artistic developments.

As the department “moves to-
ward better student understand-
ing of the resources. both human
and material that are available

‘ within the University.-"Hall noted

that courses such as Associate
Professor Robert Dohertys will
be offered in greater number.
This course will deal with the
traditional cultures of North
American Indians and ‘how these
cultures responded to pressure
t'rom advancing Europeans. Do-
herty extends to us The Teachings

of Don Juan and Black Elk Speaks A_
among his required texts for this

course. _
Doherty isaalso offering a course

on the role of religion in Ameri- T

Levine is offering a course in a re-
lated field: Rural America: The
Pre-Modern Era. His course will

it will move on to the relationships
and conflicts between urban and

mi These seminars, which the de-
partment feels will- increase the
degree of contactbetween profes-
sors -and students and course sub- /
ject matter, will coincide with the
/History 169 and 170 course list-

ings. These are‘ independent study A’

options which will allow the stu-.
dent to work intensively with a
professor, either producing a ma-
jor research paper} or delving’ into
specific topics in considerable

_ depth within the framework of an,»-

reading seminar. _.

Hall remarked that a'1m8ugh
this _ policy. which encourages

‘close contact between student and

instructor. is. a positive force in

the department. it causes diffi-

culties “because the -University...

» contributions. Redbook seems proud to be running
the story; they are sending out a lot‘ of press re—

 

'l‘he releases give away the reasoning behind
the author‘s change of heart. I am disappointed.

Bill Buckley has thrown away the magic cloak
of involuted logic which once shielded the foolish-
ness of his basic premises. He opposses -the con-
tinued existence of criminal penalties for the pos-
session or use of marijuana,’ not because the vege-
table is harmless, not on the grounds that the law
has stigmatized a possibly useful herb, but simply
because the laws we now have cannot be effectively

\

This is poor logic andworse law.

The reasoning‘ that laws which are ‘impossible
or inconvenient to administer should be repealed.
has acquired the force of law if not of respectab_il—
ity in this country. The most conspicuous example
of such repeal was the old experiment of Prohibi-
tion. Even when the Amendment was killed. but left
hanging on the Constitution like a hangnail as a re— -
minder of the mortality _and occasional foolishness
of human law. it did not expire on quite such utilit-
arian grouiidsn Th driving force behind the re— '
peal may well have been the painfully acquired

' knowledge that that law could not be enforced. but
the Congress in those days was gracious even in
defeat. It admitted. in effect. that Prohibition had
been a stupid idea. that the several states had allow-
ed themselves to be "panicked -into ratifying what
was in fact a view of alcohol which was the exclu-

. sive property of a hysterical minority.

' The mistake was acknowledged and rectified."

Now it seems that the’ law can do no wrong. ex-
cept perhaps economically. We should abandon a
"position which was not in itself wrong simply be-
cause we can no longer afford to support it. Or the
same reasoning; our. most recent war was neither
wrong nor a result of" _faulty judgment: it was sim-
ply an investment we dumped when itffailed to pay

An extension of this brand of cheap reasoning is

‘ interesting but scary." We spend a fortune every

year. as a nation. on the control of automobile traf-

fic. Despite our efforts. 55.000 people die yearly as

a result of traffic mishaps. Oviously our laws can-.

not be enforced; why not scrap them and spend the
money on something that works‘?

Murder is illegal but it happens every day. The .
cities are in desperate financial trouble. Police and
fire department salaries are a huge part of every
city’s budget. Dump them.

Legal services provided to the poor often allow
them to successfully sue the prosperous. oi‘ even

the government. Off with its budget.

This could go on for longer than would fit on
this page. The point. I think. is clear. The formerly
admirable‘ William Buckley has added his voice to
those of the forces of Nixonian pragmatism. He will

- probably "trick a lot ‘of people the is ver_v persua-

Some time ago. I was walking through the hallowed halls of the Ca-
thedral with a classmate when he was treated to some act of dis-
courtesy by another student.

With such a touch of scorn in his voice. my companion grumbled.
"Typical Pitt student! "

Although I don’t know what research this fellow did on illbred peo-
ple, I tend to believe his blanket indictment of our campus’ student body

is a little unfair. But just the same, at times his immortal words do

seem to ring true.

Take the people who block the halls. Honestly. I wish someone
would take them. '

On the one day. for some unknown reason. that you are hurrying to
class. you find your path blocked by dozens of conversing students. In
the halls they stand in tightly-packed’ clumps. laughing and _yaking. and

, effectively stopping traffic. E
-On the stairways and sidewalks, they walk three or four abreast,
and move about as fast as molasses in freezing weather.

During a lecture, they slurp, short, and sniffle as if modern tech-
nology had never created that wondrous invention, the handerchief.
But the list is too long for this space.‘
Recently. I began to wonder what might be done about the bad inan-
ners problem at Pitt. So one day. coming to school on the bus. I dis‘.-
.cussed it with a good friend who has a few-absolutely atrocious habits.
Aside from learning what it’s like to be coughed at, I discovered from

the dialogue that bad manners is a touchy subject with the people who
are the worst offenders.

When I called my friend "boorish." he told me where to go and

what to do once I got there. _ y
Mind you. this was a friend. so I probably got off easy. If he were

an enemy or a sti'ag2er. he no doubt could have broken by wrists and-..

dumped lighted cigarets down by shirt collar.

All this put a damper on a brilliant plan of mine that would have
made etiquette evangelists out of Pitt’s-slob community.

I thought maybe the College of Arts-and Sciences could offer
courses in social breeding.-The University could make a professor of
columnist Elizabeth Post. daugher-in—law of the famous Emily Post.
and could thereby throw a crumb to the women‘s rights advocates in
the process. ' - ' ‘ v

The program would be called "Post Undergraduate Work.“

Now I realize that the people who would need the program the
most, would be the least likely to sign up for it.‘Oh, well.

Controversial Low Could

‘Affect World Health

J By .ioii.\' STOWELL

1 Associated Press Writer

\\';\.\‘lll.\'(i'l‘()\ «AP» »— A deceptively simple federal law. on the
_.books for 1:3 years. is behind a controversy which could liilluencc
the health not only of :\lliCl‘l(‘ttIl.\'. but of people around the world.

The haunting question. which has baffled the world‘s top scien-
tists so far. is whether any amount ~ no matter how small # of a
chemical that causes cancer in laboratory animals can be intentioii-
ally added to food without risk.

The difficulty is that no one can say whether laboratory tests
translate into danger to humans, and how much of any element pos-
fesathreat.

Consumers and Congress are caught in the middle of the long-
running debate between public-interest groups and the food and
f.-liemlcal industry. ‘

.n—\ ".\'o congressman is going to be put in the position of voting
tor" cancer.“ said a high Food and Drug Administration official.
‘I think we owe it to them to provide an escape route.“

_ At the heart of the conti‘oversy is a 1958 amendment. the so-
1:-alled Delaney Clause. to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act which
reads in part: ~

“No additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce
cancer when ingested by man or animals, or if it is found, after tests
which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food addi-
izives, to induce cancer in man or animal. . . .”

The law takes its name unofficiall_v from Rep. James J. Delaney.
D—.\'.\'.. who pushed it through after five _vears of hearings on food
‘chemicals. »
it Twice before the law has come under attack—in 1969 when the

~)opu.lar artificial sweetener cyclamate was banned. and again last
ceai when the livestock—feed additive diethylstilbestrol DES was or-
fired off the market.

The loss to consumers has been minute. and relatively inexpen-

tve. Alternatives were available in most cases although perhaps
not as effective.

DES fias been banned only from livestock feed. Pending results
i>f' still-secret Agriculture Department tests. the growth hormone can
foe used as ear-implant pellets although cattle are a month slower in
reaching market weight.

“At this point in time,” says FDA Commissioner Charles C. Ed-
wards, “most of the damage that has been done in the application of
Delaney has been a commercial damage and not a consumer dam-
age.”

But federal regulators. businessmen and increasing numbers of
.‘;:ongressrnen are concerned that refined testing techniques may
'.<trike down more and more food additives.

, Consumer groups are equally concerned that any modification of

§he  would expose more persons to cancer.

Lg Delaney has caused FDA to do some fancy stepping on selen-

“um. an essential nutrient for man and animals. ’
' Almost two years ago the American Feed Manufacturers Asso-
éiation petitioned FDA for permission to use selenium in chicken,
turkey and pig feed to overcome natural deficiencies in the Mid-
‘;.vest and far Northwest. They said producers were losing more than
540 million a year because of low production and high mortality.

FDA has delayed approval because large doses of selenium are
.:iighly toxic. and a suspected carcinogen.

Dellmuth’s proposal. which

“This will make possible the
liveliest kind of competition,
which should result in the best

New regional banks would be

those in populated areas. _

More personal loan services-

ed by Kerner.

The government also charged
the defendants concealed own-
ership of the stock through coin-

plicated financial transactions
and they improperly filed tax
returns in 1966' and 1967 when

they revealed their profits.

Kerner was charged with ly-
ing to a federal grand jury by
denying he ever discussed rac-
ing dates with racing board mem-
bers. .

He was convicted of all 17
counts charged and Isaacs was
convicted of the 15 counts against
him.

Kerner. governor of Illinois
from 1961 to 1968. was impas-
sive in the courtroom. -

Kerner spent 312 days on the wit-
nessstand denying charges against
him. The defense conceded that
Kerner and Isaacs had obtained
the stock and made a profit from
ittin a six—year period. Bu_t Ker-
ner contended the stock was not
a bribe. that he never commit-
ted an act to influence racing
dates in Illinois and that he pro-
perly paid taxes on his stock
profits.

The defense for Kerner was
based heavily on discrediting
the government’s two key witness-
es, Marjorie -Everett, former
head of Chicago. Thoroughbred
Enterprise, and William S. Mill-
er, racing chairman during Ker-
ner’s administration.‘

Miller. 72. was indicted with
Kerner and Isaacs. but the gov-
ernment agreed to dismiss char-
ges against him in exchange for
his testimony.

Kerner has been on leave
with pay from his $42.500-a-year

_post on the appeals bench since

he and Isaacs were indicted Dec.
15. 1971.

  Speakers Appraise '
 Federal Shield Law   

NEW YORK lAP>—The editor
of the Detroit News says the Su-
preme Courts decision last June
on confidentiality of newsmens
sources necessitates the enact-
ment of a “highly qualified shield
law."

Martin S. Hayden. who also is
vice president of the newspaper.
told a journalism conference Sun-

vday that in general his newspaper
believes that state and federal leg-
islatures "should keep their noses
out of our business."

“We were against the fair news-
paper act on account of its being
a special economic privilege for
publishers,” he said.

"We did not agree with some
publishers who thought the news-

papers should be free from the,

wage and price controls act and
we don't favor post office subsi-
dies for newspapers."

But Hayden said the Supreme
Courts ruling "last June com-
pelling New York Times reporter
Earl Caldwell todisclose confi-
dential information had made him
believe in "the necessity of a fed-
eral shield law."

by RICH KIENZLE

— Rock music and television have
been natural enemies ever since
Ed Sullivan insisted Elvis Presley,
be shown from the waist up in
1956. With a few exceptions. like
Shindig, the 1968 Elvis special
and the Cat Stevens Leon Rus-
sell special on educational TV. it‘s
been a constant war. The Band
walked off a Glen Campbell seg-
ment when he insisted they per-
from from a pickup truck. sur-
rounded by haystacks. Bob Dylan
walked off Sullivan‘s show when
CBS refused to let him sing an an-
ti-John Birch song in 1962. The
Rolling Stones appeared on the
Hollywood Palace in 1964 and
were subjected to a stream of
anti—longhair comments from host
Dean Martin. TV seems to be
afraid of rock. and it doesn‘t look
like the current rock TV series
have the potential to reconcile the
two.

In Concert’s earliest show with
Alice Cooper was knocked off a
few local ABC stations when pro-
gram directors were offended b_v
Alice's silly but‘ certainly not ob-
scene antics. Nothing like this has
happened "so far on the Midnight

A .Special, which \is really a linear

descendant of American Band-
stand (oddly enough. AB's foun-
der Dick Clark‘ produced the In
Concert segment review— .

‘ed here).
Since Midnight S_pecial-started‘

first, I’ll talk about it. The host
was Mac Davis, who ha just ap-
peared on Johnny Carson due." to
someone’s bad timing at NBC.
Davis fancies himself a “song
painter.” What he really does is
write and sing mostly yammery
songs about “marshallowl skies”
and such’. To his credit he wrote
“Ghetto,” a fine song made pop-
ular by Elvis. “Dream Me Home”
is a lame traveling song. I get the
impression Davis wrote it just to
get the word “Nashville” in there.
“Baby D ’ Hooked ii ”

would sound, good by the Right-
eous Brothers, but Mac doesn't
do it justice. His cutesy 1964 cof-
feehouse patter between song
was pretty terrible, as was his
self-indulgent rap about some-
thing called “hamboning.”

Billy Preston performed in a
restrained manner. but whoever
was stupid enough to ‘schedule him
so it appeared here and on In Con-
cert the same night should be shot.
Nowadays. Billy thinks he’s Sly
Stone. so he donned a big aim and
knee boots. "Blackbirds." the
Beatle tune seemed too light for
the hard sound of his band.
"That‘s the Way God Planned It.”
performed in a gospel style. lack-
ed the emotional thing so impor-
tant to good gospel music.

The Doobie Brothers turned me
off with the first note of "Jesus Is
Just Alright.“ recorded appar-
ently to cash in on the current
Jesus foolishness sweeping’ the
country. lnstrumentall_v they get
their ‘sound from the Allman
Brothers. even ripping off the Du-
ane Allman-Dick Betts dual lead
guitars. One cant really dance to
Sitting

Billy Paul sounds a lot like John-

ny Mathis, but that’s cool. Mathis

just recorded his “Me and Mrs. ‘

Jones.” His all-over sound is sort
of supper ‘club, but after _the
“heavy” crab of the Doobies it
was a Godsend. Hands down, they
were the most professional outfit

on either show. Paul is of the

Gamble-Huff school of R&B out

"of Philadelphia and if he’s any-

indication, Philly might become
the sort of-R&B center Detroit

.was in the early sixties. The man

has class, no doubt about it.
The Dueling Banjos are about

as country as the Beverly Hill-'

billies. Need more be said‘? Speak-
ing of country. veteran country
singer. Waylon Jennings was a dis-

appointment. He sang "You Can

Johnny Cash style. He's trying to
break into rock music and show-
ed it with his puff sleeve shirt.
cowboy hat and jeans. He'd never
get away with that at a country
concert. Maybe he should try be-
ing himself.

God knows whose idea it was to
drag Joan Rivers outvof the sup-
per clubs to appear for three min-
utes on Midnight Special. The au-
dience laughter was forced as she
related her middle—aged stories
about adolesence and dating.

In Concert led off-with Kenny
Loggins and Jim Messina. Front-
ing an incredibly tight band, they
tore into their superb hit “Your
Mama Don’t Dance.” The- next
thing was a nice but rambling
flute jam. Then everybody but
Loggins left the stage. He grab-
bed an accoustic guitar and pro-
ceeded to out-lame Mac Davis
with an unnamed song and some-—
thing _called “Dixie Holiday.”

Mercifully, the band came back to.

do another rocker and a “Coun-
try” tune thatywas rather poorly
played, with Al Garth’s fiddle
-nearly inaudible. Messina picked’
a nice guitar solo.’ He used to be

with Poco’ and. I _think he was v

Poco.

Billy Preston went from medio-
cre on NBC to obnoxious on ABC.‘
This time" he strutted around’ the
stage. occasionally shouting "Do
You Feel Alright?“ He did a ter-

rible Sly imitation on "Day Trip- -

per” and a long monotonous jam

on electric piano. "Get Back" al-
most caught fire. but his constant
jumping about ruined it. Also. the
constant camera shots of the -kids
in the audience jumping. clapping.
and waving like a demented How-
dy Doody peanut gallery become
embarrassing to watch after a
while.

The Hollies were best known as
apart of the British Invasion of the
mid—sixties and as Graliam
.\'ash’s old band. Recently they
regained popularity with _ "He
Ain't Heavy” and f'Long Cool
Woman." Their first thing. "Long
Dark Road"was pretty bad with
the famous Hollies harmonies off-
key and the guitar and harp play-
ing quite sloppy. ‘

The oldie “Carrie Anne” ‘was _

much better, and sounded like
Nash was still with the group.
“Bus Stop” showed. the hole left
when he moved on. His high voice
was missing and their attempts to
cover.it up resulted in more off-

key singing-. They seemed to know

it, and stopped halfway through.
“He Ain’t Heavy” was well-play-
ed, but can you dig a song with
lines like “his welfare is my con-
cern?” They wound up with the
excellent “Long Cool Woman in a
Black Dress,” which proved that

- the Hollies are primarily a great

singles band, when they want to
be.

Between the two 'shows.,.I think
In Concert is the better-one. But
it seems only a few acts make

the rounds of both shows. like Cur-

tis Mayfield and the Doobies.

‘ ice composed and directed by Nathan Davis of the Music Depart-
mentat Pitt. Described as an "international-interdenominational‘,'
service. the composition is based upon expressions of various faiths
. throughout the world. ‘
The service isa large scale effort and requires the participation
of a number of artists. In addition the University of Pittsburgh Jazz
Ensemble, which Mr. Davis conducts, the Heinz Chapel Concert
Choir, the University and City Ministries Gospel Choir, and guest
soloists Brenda Joyce and Mary Ann Doody will also participate.

Various members of the clergy and other representatives of the
faiths involved in the undertaking will offer prayersand messages
throughout the course of the service. The international character of

’ the service will be enhanced by the offering of these various pray-
ersin the original language of each religious group. A . ‘
Musically speaking, the, composition also draws upon original
rhythms and melodies which characterize the regions of the reli- 4
gions represented in the program. Latin, African, American, Indian,

music. t

rly captures the strength of

'hrough short, telling opening
nes, director Jan Troell shows
desperation of a life made in-
arable by both natural disas-
s and exploitation by rich
downers and hypocritical cler-
. The central characters are
rl Oskar (Max von Sydow)
l his wife Kristina (Liv Ull-
nn). No matter how much
:kbreaking toil they put into

worship there in peace. It is
touching to see how their simple

to face unknown dangers.

duous sea voyage in cramped
quarters. This portion is truly

made particularly evident. Lice.
stench. and death follow _ but
their resolve is never shaken.

The cast is uniformly excellent
and so perfectly suited to their
roles that it seems that the char-
acters themselves and not actors
are on the screen. Max von
Sydow and Liv Ullmann super-
bly portray the varuous emotions
of Karl and Kristina—the blissful
happiness of young love, the
despair when crops spoil and
food supply is in doubt, the agony
of seeing their young daughter
die, and most important, the hope
for a better life which sustains
them through the difficult jour-
ney to America. Eddie Axberg is
fine in showing how the belief
in “the Promised Land” took
shape in Robert and spread to

others. _
He has some very moving

scenes with Pierre Lindstedt who
portarys a fellow laborer. Special
mention must also be given to
the finely-etched‘ characteriza-
tions of Allan Edwall as the-de-
dicated Danjel and Monica
Zetterlund as a prostitute who
becomes one of his followers.

The Emigrants is one of the
few films to effectively deal with
an epic subject and one of the
great ones concerning the early
growth of America.

it seemed, of the deep sea, for it
was impossible that the mind or

sheet of water which stretched
away in leagues of rippling lus-
tre to the north and south, or

trace the narrow line of islets
bounding it to the east.
The salt breeze. the white

moaning sea—birds. the masses of
black weed separating and disap-
pearing gradually. in knots of
heaving shoal. under the advance

As the boat drew nearer to the

had just left sank behind him
into one long, low, sad-coloured
line, tufted irregularly with brush-

seemed its northern extremity,
the hills of Arqua rose in a dark
cluster of purple pyramids, bal-
anced on the bright mirage of the
lagoon; two or three smooth surg-

reached, and the outmost of

its untrodden streets _was enter-
ed, not through towered gate or
guarded rampart, but as a deep
inlet between two rocks of coral
in the Indian Sea, when first
upon the traveller’s sight opened
the long ranges of columned pal-"
aces, — each with its black boat
moored at the portal, — each with
its image cast down, beneath its
feet, upon that green pavement
which every breeze broke into
new fantasies of rich tessella-
tionﬁ when first, at the extremi-
ty of the bright vista, the shadowy
Rialto threw its colossal curve
slowly forth from behind the pal-
ace of the Camerlenghi.

That strange curve. so delicate.
so adamantine. strong as a iiioun—
tain cavern. graceful as a_bow just
bent: when first. before its moon-
like circumference was all risen.
the gondolier‘s cry ‘Ah! Stali.‘
struck sharp upon the ear. and
the prow turned aside under the
mighty cornices that half met
over the narrow canal. where the
plush of the water followed close
and loud. ringing along the mar-
ble by the boat‘s side; and when
at last that boat darted forth upon
the breadth of silver sea. across
which the front of the Ducal
palace. flushed with its sanguine
veins. looks to the snowy dome
of Our Lady of Salvation. it was
no marvel that the mind should be
so deeply entranced by the vis-
ionary charm of a scene so beau-
tiful and so strange. as to forget
the darker truths of its history and
its being.

Well might it seem that such
a city had owed her existence
rather to the rod of the enchan-
ter. than the fear of the fugitive:
that the waters which encircled
her had been’ chosen for the
mirror of her state. rather than
the shelter .of her nakedness:
and that all which in nature was
wild~or.merciless. — Time and De-
cay. as well asthe waves and
tempests. — had been won to adorn
her instead of to destroy. and
migh_t still spare. for ages ‘to

have fixed for its throne the sands

game entertainment of the 1972-
73 basketball season at the Field

During the 1971-72 campaign
the Cavaliers racked up a 21-7

game by Lafayette by the slim

Four of these wins have been
against teams that Pitt has also
faced thislyear-; The Cavaliers
have defeated West Virginia,
Penn State, and William and Mary
by substantially the same amount
of points as Pitt. I

The Panthers. however. fell vic-
tim to North Carolina by the
score of 99-70 while the Cavaliers
downed the Tar Heels. 84-78. -

With the Panthers the. Cava-
liers hold the edge in the short se-
ries by 3-1. In last year‘s contest
Virginia thoroughly beat the Pan-
tllel/IS. 84-74. - '

Key factors in’ last season’s vic-
tory were Barry Parkhill who
scored 22 points off of the Cats
and Scott McCandlish who collect-
ed 13 points. McCandlish has since

graduated, [but Parkhill is-back in '

his senior year to hassle the Cats
once more.

For the past two years Parkhill
has led Virginia in scoi‘ing7du1'-
ing the 1971-72 season he reached
a21.6 average. ‘

In 1972 Parkhill was showered
with honors. The long list is as fol-
lows: he_ was acclaimed unani-
mous All-ACC and All-Tourna-'
ment. ACC basketball player of
theyear. ACC athlete of theyeai‘.

zato. who at the same time remains somewhat surprised at his success
this season. "I.can't really .explaini‘t. I haven't done anything different

But now the skinny. [black-haired V kid‘ from Brjdgeville has "won
more matches than anyone on the Panther squad and he is one of Coach
A-dams best hopes for an Eastern title. Buzzato agrees with Adams.

“Ive got a- shot rat the Eastern championshipt. I've beaten every— .
body but the kid from Navy.”‘* he said. The kidfrom l\'avy is Ros Chaf-
in. who decisioned John in Pitts heartbreaking 19-15 loss to the Mid-
dies. who are considered a good bet for number one or two in-the East.
"I'd like to wrestle him again—in the finals. before the home crowd."

Buzzato feels that his record will speak for itself, and earn him a
top seeding in the big tourney. “I should be seeded first or second, at
least in the top-four. I’ve beaten most everyone else. One thing going,
for me is that‘I’ll only have to wrestle four times to win the title.”

According to tournament rules. the first seeded grapplers are
paired with matmen whose records are weaker. The number one seeded _
and the second seeded draws the next to last. and soon. V

Buzzato believes that this year‘s Panther squad is a "tournament
more than it is a ‘dual meet team.“ He feels that it is better ‘
than last year‘s team in that it is stocked with better individual talent.
"I think we have some people who can go to the nationals."

i_ As for the dual meet", season. the Pantherssenior "is somewhat "dis?

itt’s Roaring “Tiger”

Better yet. it was working.

Though smiles were abundant
at his performance. so was the
reaction. Why with Lucius Keese
on the floor and “Tiger" on the
sidelines. the Field House was a
noisy——yes you heard right-—noisy
place to be.

"Tim Grgurich (Pitt assistant
coach) and Bill Baierl (president
of the basketball booster club)
asked me to do it." Auslander re-
called the other day. explaining
the reason he undertook his latest
job- "I was afraid. I didn’t want
to make a fool out of myself. But
after thinking about it. I thought
the worst I could do was fail."

It's evident now that Tiger has
not failed. But if the fans have
taken to him. he has also found.
new friends.

"I think the Pitt. fans are tre-
mendous. I really do. In the past
when I used to come to the games
they were quiet. ‘For not knowing

‘how they would respond. they

have been great.“

“Tiger" Paul has been great
too. For his new found success. he
has been awarded his own private
chair in front of the student sec-
tion. he has made threeroad trips
with the Panthers. and his show
has become as certain as the
opening jumpball. But it’s when
the Tigers comes off his chair that
the fireworks begin. First he will
ask for a "P" an “I."‘a "t” and

a “T“ via the megaphone. Then he "

will brutally cast the amplifier
aside and begin what looks like a

» shadow boxing match, demandinga

"Lets go Pitt" from the parti-
sans.

but I‘ll do it as long as the fans
respond and the players like it.
I like composed people in the

me. I guess you could call me the
George Allen of collegiate basket-

“I‘m more bark than bite. but I
live and die with the team."

A sign that Pitt officials have
appreciated his efforts is evi-
denced in the fact that~"Tiger"
has traveled with the hoopsters.
And he has left: his mark at each
stop.

when the official told me to be
quiet. I had to listen. I had gotten
a ride-up to Philly and didn’t want
to be sent outside to stand in the
cold."

And at Notre Dame. “Tiger"
was told he was the greatest.

"Mrs. Digger Phelps—the No-
tre Dame coach‘s wife—told me I
was the greatest."

What may come as a surprise
to a lot of people is the fact that
Auslander has a very intelligent
basketball mind. Yes. In the past
he has coached all-star teams-

Wuycik on his team—and heseven
has an evaluation of” the squad he
cheers so hard for. . ‘

"I think” Pitt has a Very fine nu-
cleus for a good team. With a lit-
tle more consistent play out of the
center position they would be
much better,” he explained. as
any coach might.

A Attitude Key  

 

Rich Marl-cley’s Success

by LYNN HARRIS
Acclaimed the “biggest success story of the
track program this year" by coach Don Mollenauer.
Rich Markley is provin”g that attitude is a fundamen——
tal key to success.

A 1970 graduate of Moon High School. Markley
started running track in his’ freshman year. He
lettered in 10th grade and broke the record in the
mile and half mile at Moon High. so by the time he
was a senior he had quite a reputation. Senior year
he also ran cross country and was undefeated in
dual meets.

Attitude was a major factor in his\success but
the caliber of competition at Moon High School was
not indicative of what he would face in the future.

Rich chose Pitt over Penn State, the University
of Pennsylvania, and several other schools for two
reasons: the academics were excellent at Pitt and
coming to Pittsburgh he would face the kind of ‘com-
petition he felt he needed to reach his potential.

/

Beginning his freshman year. his attitude had a
negative effect on his performance. Running cross
country Rich injured his leg. then preparing for the

indoor track season he twisted his ankle.’

In his sophomore year he broke his hand during
cross country but ran during the outdoor track sea-
son. He enjoyedthe running but his mental outlook
was poor. On the verge of giving up track for good at
the end of the outdoor season Rich actually did stop

V running until late August. When faced with the up-
' coming '72 season Rich made a decision. ,

“If I run I’m going to do it 100 per cent, and if
I don’t succeed I can at least‘ say I tried,” com-
mented Markley. P

Starting out with cross country this year Rich
improved in comparison to past performances.
Then the indoor season started and this is where
attitude has played the key role. ‘

Improving throughout the season Rich reached»
his peak at Michigan State in the three quarter
mile with a 3 :01. ”

“I’m doing better than Iexpected, but Ifeel I
still haven't reached my potential,” said Rich.

"1 would like to go to the nationals." he contin-
ued.-

Besides Coach Banner the trackster credits
Coach Mollenauer and Jerry Richey for giving him
the extra incentive to win.

Commenting on the team as a whole, Markley ’
feels the relay teams have good potential. “We can
win at the IC4A’s if we can put everything to-
gether,” referred Rich to the poor health and in-
juries that have plagued the team this year.

Markley will run the outdoor season and con-

‘tinue working out in preparation for cross country

next year.

Satisfied with the track program at Pitt Rich
especially likes the dual meets. '

“The dual meets with the small schools gives me
the opportunity to compete in other events and see
the results. It also gives athletes who aren't pro-
gressing real fast a chance to compete and prove
themselves,” commented the trackster. _

A psychology major. hoping to go to law school.
Markley would like to keep running in the future to
"keep in shape."

Attitude being the key element in Rich Mark-
1ey‘s success thus far this track season. he leaves
the impression that it will continue taking the posi-
tive form that it has had~—with the results it has

had.too.

Wednesday, February 21, l973——THE PITT NEWS—Page 11 if

  The Tiger

(‘Co/ztinueizl from Pay/e 10)

Relaxing in the stands before
the North Carolina A&T game
Wednesday night. petting his Pitt
varsity letter sweater. given to
him ‘by Frank Gustine la former
Pitt athlete ). Auslander explained
why he is called a "Tiger."

"When I was 13 years old. I
tried out for my high school foot-
ball team." the 1970 Peabody
High graduate said. “I was about
about 5-2‘ and weighed 200
pounds. I was pretty bad. but I
had illusions of granduer danc-
ing in my head. you know. another
"Red" Grange. But when I hit
the dummy they nicknamed me
“Tiger." because it/looked like
the dummy was hitting me.“ .

Getting back to the more pleas-

ant present. Auslander gave an-..

other reason why; he likes his new
job so much.‘ I

"At Notre Dame the team lost a
heartbreaker. I remember when
the game was lost and Sam Flem-
ing dove trying to steal a ball from
Dwight Clay. After he fell. Clay
offered Sam his hand and Sam
took it. Th_at took real class. Even
in defeat sportmanship didn‘t lose
its place. That typifi-es the kind
of kids thy have here and why
I'm proud to be connected with
them." I

Sometimes though. "Tiger”
hopestheg fans would display the
same kind of sportsmanship.

"It bothers me when fans from

Pitt root against Duquesne and
Duquesne fans root against Pitt.

when they aren‘t playing each

other in the Steel Bowl. I'm a bas-

ketball fan and I like to see the_— 

Pittsburgh teams win. I root for 

Duquesne when they play. even
though my heart is with Pitt."

Duquesne. however. has had a

'.V

full time cheerleader for 18
years. and Auslander respects 
Mossie hoot—shoot Rah-rah"  ‘-

Murphy for what he is- number
one. '

"People tell. me I'm the g,i‘eat-yﬁif

est. But in this city I consider my-'
self number two cheerleaderr
Mossie "Shoot-shoot
years and I can't be expected to
be as good as he is." I ”

Well. "Tiger" Paul, will find...‘

Rah-rah";

  

:4‘-...

himself rooting against Duquesne if 

again next year. He will also meets '

Murphy head on in another con-

frontation for the city's number ._'

one ranking.

How’s that for another reason"

for next year's Steel Bowl!
