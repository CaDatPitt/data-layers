For R-Day

Because of the intense require-
ments of the acceleration program,
classes will not be ‘dismissed today
to accommodate 18 and 19 year old
men students who must register in
the ﬁfth national draft.

Using almost the same proced-
ure used during the last draft held
in the University in February, the
registering will take place in the
lounge of Foster Memorial hall
-from 7 o’clock in the morning to 9
o’clock in the evening.

J. G‘. Quick, University registrar,
will be the chief draft registrar of
the University which is a precinct
of Oakland’s draft board number
four. He will be assisted by nine
subordinate registrars.

Included in this registration are
students who have reached their
twentieth birthday since last Jan-
uary ﬁrst.

Two cards are to be ﬁlled out

Regular Classes

In order to meet requirements
of the accelerated program, class-
es will meet, according to sched-
ule, on “R” Day, Tuesday, June
30. (Today) -

Selective Service Registration
for students eighteen and nine-
teen years of age will be con-
ducted in the Social Rom of Fos-

by the registrar,:who does all the
writing. Recorded will be such
things as the registrant’s name,
address, place of birth, age, and
employment.

After the information has been
certiﬁed, both registrar and regis-
trant will sign the cards. One card
will be sent immediately to the 10-
cal draft board of the student. Thus,
students, no matter where they live
or where their local draft board
meets, can register at the Univer-
sity. The second card must be car-
ried by the registrant in accordance
with Federal regulations.

Fewer registrants are expected to
sign up today than registered last
February 16 when over 600 stu-
dents and faculty members regis-
tered. S '

Cicsed Windows, Dull Blue Lights,

By IRVVIN ROSEN
I saw the Cathedral of Learning
completely dark last Thursday
night. Long before the blackout
siren sounded the Cathedral was
made :ready—windows were closed
and locked, shades were drawn,
lights put out, dull blue lights put
in the elevators‘ instead of the
bright white on-es, the building
cleared of students.
In charge of darkening the build-

 "§ ing was Dr. John Geise, the Ca-

"-thedral air—raid warden. I met Dr.
,Geise Thursday night at 8:30, he
had got me a special permit to be
in the building during the black-
out.

At 8:30 we started. First the eve-

he ning school and defense training

courses and some accounting classes
were dismissed after it got too dark
to conduct classes by daylight. No
lights were turned on after the
ﬁliniout.

A Then all the lights on the ﬁrst
reeipfioors were turned 0

ut, and-

building was dark. All this was done
before the blackout started, so that
by the time the bells and sirens
sounded, all of the Cathedral’s
5,000 odd lights had been turned
out.

Every light was put out———lights
in halls, in offices, table lamps in
the faculty club, lights on elevat-
for dashboards, lights on the stair-
ways, the huge Commons room
chandeliers, even lights warming
the cages of experimental chick-
ens in the biology lab were ex-
tinguishcd.

As soon as each room was sup-
posedly cleared and darkened, Dr.
Giese began his inspection——every
room of every ﬂoor of the building.
Starting from the 36th ﬂoor and
working groundward, it took war-
den Giese only about 45 minutes to
cover the entire Cathedral——so well
had his route been planned before-
hand.

caught well in advance o'f the black-
out signal, so that when the warn-
ing ﬁnally came at 9:15 Dr. Ge.ise’s
work had been done—the Cathedral
was in complete darkness.

When the blackout ﬁnally came
we took an elevator to 36, got out,
climbed up four or ﬁve ﬂights of
wooden steps, then up a ladder and
out onto the Cathedral roof. In less

No one loves a loser. The Panther baseball squad prac-
tically lost dailythis past spring, consequently big league

scouts were as scarce as the ‘local victories. Last year when“

the Blue and Gold had a winner, no less than ﬁve players were
offered contracts, but this season, Johnny Brown was the only
lad given a baseball job. Brown is trying out with the Canton
ball club in the Middle Atlantic league, but may have to forego
baseball for the Army.

Bobby Malloy, ﬁreball hurler from last
reported pitching brilliant ball for the Birmingham Barons
in the Southern Association.

Baseball mentor Ralph Mitterling is biting his nails these
days waiting for next spring’s season to start. The cause for
all of Mitterling’s impatience is freshman Howard Scott. Scott
is pitching ball for a Wilkinsburg sandlot baseball team. Yes,
he wins, but .that’s not all. In every game he has hurled thus
far this season he hasst-ruck out 21 men.

Carlson Tries His Curve,

Proves He .Was   Right  

By ELAINE KAHN _
To those. who may have voiced

some skepticism regarding the Fa-
tigue Curve theory which our Doc-P
tor Carlson has been promoting

these past few years, we present:

the case of the Doctor, himself. The
Doctor had, over the years, picked
upsome 220 pounds, his only ambi-
tion’ after ;dinner was to sleep, and
his conditioning was not of A the
-best. Then he began to take hisown

.._test of physical ‘application and con-

ditioning, going through the exer-
cises three times a day.

With ‘the results only partially
in, we ﬁiid the Doctor has dropped
twenty pounds, his conditioning is
so good that he makes his daily

excursions to Trees gym byway ' 1

of the steps, all 169,01‘ them, and
"instead of sleeping after dinner,
spoils the sleep of somerof his stu-
dents by staying up to correct their
papers. '

The fatigue curve has been incor-
porated into a test which tries its
subject for condition, training, pro-
duction, and application. The test
demands that the subjectdo some
simple exercise such as the stand-
ing ruﬁ for a period of ten seconds,
going “all out” each time he per-
forms the exercise.

At the end of ten seconds the
number of times the exercises was
preformed is recorded. Two min-

utes of rest are interposed, the ex-’

ercise is repeated, and the results
again recorded. Ten seconds of ex-

ercise and two minutes of rest are '

alternated until 100 seconds of work
has been recorded.

Any deviation from the normal
rate of decrease is counted as an
error which counts ten points. The
errors are then subtracted from
100’to give the rate of application.

Condition is measured by taking

 

DR. H. CLIFFORD-CARLSON
authority on curves

the pulse rate of the applicant be- ‘

fore exercise, immediately after-
wards, and at two minute intervals
until the pulse rate is again normal.
A quick return of the pulse rate to
normal indicates good condition. A
slow return indicates the need
of better conditioning, possible
through conscientious repetition of
the test.

The test is receiving its most not-
able workout in a graduate physi-
cal education course. There are

' some thirty students in the class

ranging all the way from 21-year-
old students to 61-year-old teach-
ers. One member of the class is a
61-year-old woman, the mother of
four children, one of whom is a
teacher at Yale.

    Two ”Ne..vdiga tion Colurisiesj

Added For_$ervice Men 1,  

For the convenience of men en-
tering Army or Navy aviation and
the Navy, Merchant Marine, or
Coast Guard, two new courses in
navigation, one air navigation and
one sea navigation, have been added
to the University’s curriculum, Dr.
Frank W. Shockley, director of the
summer session, announced last
week. I

Two sections in air navigation,
one daytime and one evening have
been inaugurated. One section
meets Mondays through Fridays
from 1 to 2:30 o'clock from June
29 to August 7. Another meets
Monday, Wednesday, and’ Friday
evenings from 6:15 to 9 o'clock Tor
six weeks. Dr. James Taylor, head
of the mathematics department,
announces that these courses carry
three credits.

For men entering the Navy, Mer-
chant Marine, or Coast Guard,
courses in Sea Navigation have
been continued, with sections ar-
ranged for both day and evening.
One class meets Monday through
Friday from 1 to 2:30 o'clock for
six weeks, and the other meets Mon-
day, Wednesday, and Friday eve-
nings from 6:15 to 9 o’clock.

These courses, inaugurated in

March, are part of a program to
assist the Army and Navy in pre-
paring men for commissions, and
to make those holding commissions
more valuable to the services, Dr.
Taylor stated. Explaining that sea
navigation and advanced mathe-

matics courses have already been,

offered, Dr. Taylor said that more

than 100 men, all awaiting call for

service, have taken the courses.
“While the essential principles of

air navigation and sea navigation"

are the same,” he said, “the sub-
jects dilfer in certain important re-
spects.” For this reason the new
course in air navigation was plan-
ned. ‘ /\
