‘Old’ Senate Hears
Accomplishments, 1 1
Allocation Suggestions

By DAN BOOKER,
In the midst of a campaign to elect a new Senate, the
incumbent Student Government (SG) had its ﬁnal business

meeting last night. After President Ralph Manning went

over SG accomplishments for the past year, the senators

considered in a two-and-a-half hour session all special Allo-

cations Committee recommendations. »
Manning cited the large trimester poll turnout, the “ex-

cellent” Homecoming and Parents Weekend ‘programs, the’

formation of and membership ill state and city-wide organ-
izations, and the move for a new Student Union as signiﬁcant ac-
complishments of the retiring SG. He stressed that many of the pro-
grams started would have to be carried on by the new Senate if these

projects are to become effective.

Of the allocations recommendations, the Senate failed to approve

’ two. It was the second time the funds request of the Mens Glee Club

was returned to the committee by SG. The request asks for $4200. to
expand a concert trip through the South to last seven days. The com-
mittee had approved $2000 of this request. This was no change from
the original decision turned back in December by the senators. The
basis of the cominittee’s decision was “poor planning" 011 the Part Of
the club, noted Bill Calbin,'Allocation’s Committee member.

The other recommendation
turned back to the committee
was one allocating none of the
$200 ‘requested by the Pitt Ski
Club. The club asked for the
funds to ﬁnance participation in
a skiing competition. Both of the
reconsidered allocations requests
will be decided upon by the new
Senate.‘ I ' A '

The largest approved allocation
was $1900 for the Engineers’
Week Concert. This was only
part of the $2700 requested for
the concert. The OWL received
its total request of $1430. The
next largest allocation was one
of $925 to the ROTC Cadet Bri-
gade.

The total requested in the 11
allocations considered ‘was $16,-
6l3. Approximately $23,650. was
available for allocation, but only
a total of $6742 was approved by
the committee and by the Senate.
All of the allocations requests
considered were emergency re-

. quests and were not for programs

of this summer or next fall.
The Senate also heard several

committee reports. Tom Sachs,

chairman of the Liberal Arts

Cabinet, announced that the Fac- -

the proposals for pass-fail cours-
ulty Senate would today consider
es. Under the proposals, a stu-
dent with more than 64 credits
would be able to take a maxi-
mum of six credits not in his
major ﬁeld that would count for
graduation but for which he
would not receive a letter grade.

Latin American Studies

New Program Begins

The International Studies Pro-
gram (ISP) for the Academic
Disciplines, the Center for Latin
American Studies, and the School
of Liberal Arts have announced
a new program for concentrated
study on Latin ‘America for jun-
iors and seniors in the spring, of
this year. . -

A small and selected group of
students will spend April 26 thru
Aug. 9 in close association with‘
a resident faculty composed of
the- ‘following Latin American
specialists:
Smole of the department of Ge-
ography, Professor Juan Vazquez
of the Department of Hispanic
Languages and Literature, Pro-
fessor James Molloy of the De-
partment of Political Science, and

Professor Jose Moreno of the De-

partment of Sociology.

The program will be financed
by a Ford Foundation grant and
by the University.

According to the announce-
ment, the program is designed
around the conviction that the
study of. an area of the world
gains special meaning and value
when it is undertaken through
several disciplines simultaneous-
ly. The program's basic objective
WI“ be realized as students broad-
on and deepen their understand-
ing of satin America through con-
stant intellectual exchange with
other students and professors
from a variety of academic back-
grounds.

In order to create a small in-
tellectual community around this
program, students will be housed
together. Men will live in an area
in their dormitory which will be

adjacent to the offices of the

resident faculty. Women will be
assigned to one area in their
dormitory. Some preference in
admission to the program will be
given to students agreeing to this
arrangement _

Each student will participate
in several seminars led by the

faculty members. He  also.

study which will be developed
out of. his own interest in Latin
America. The student’s program
will be selected in consultation
with his tutor.

Students who participate will
register only for this Latin Amer-
ican program and not for any
other courses. ‘they will receive
15 credits toward graduation. Sta.

cents are encouraged to not witn-

liold application because of other
required courses in the spring,

since the start or the prograin‘

advisers, chairmen, and deans in
order to seek solutions 10!‘ ind.-

Applying students should be
juniors or seniors in good aca-
demic standing in an undergrad-
uate school in the University.
They should have a serious inter-
est in Latin America inciudmg

guage. lsacn applicant will be re-
quested to present an outime of
the independent study eacii
would like to pursue in the tu-
torial. ’ -

Application forms and further
information can be obtained from

dent to undertake independent ‘

study, upon the aptness or his
outline of work to the purposes
of the program, and upon‘. his
academic record. Applicants will

./“My immediate goals are top
listen and learn as much as I2
can,” declared Dr. Wesley Posvar-i
at a press conference yesterday

in, the Chancellor's office. “My P

general philosophy, as far asithe
administration is concerned, ‘is
that a new broom ought not to
sweep clean. I would propose to
change nothing until I know
what I’m doing.” ,
Dr. Posvar ﬁelded questions .
from reporters on the following ,
topics: '

An Honor Code at Pitt: “I really ‘V

wouldn’t think of an honor code
at Pit.” Explaining the reason- _
ing behind the honor code at the
Air Force Academy where he" cur-

rently heads the political science . '
department, Dr. Posvar stated,» '

“It is an essential part of the pro-

fessional ethic of a career officer.‘ I‘

I think the honor code is a mat-

ter of public trust in the interest ' 

of the United States.”

Pitt as -a State-Related School:‘l.-V-All

"A state-related institution gets
the calibre of ‘student that goes

to a private ‘institution. Some of  5
the great state universities.» —‘ " i

such as Michigan and Indiana e
have state support and compare
very favorably with the Ivy
League. The difference between
private and public institutions is

becoming very diffused, and the ‘

status of this institution is quite
comparable to universities itha
appear private.” ‘

Student - Faculty - Administra-
tive Relationship: “I look at a. ;
university as a single corpus of 
people who are engaged in schol-. "
arship with no clear line of de-V__‘y

niarcation between them. The
role of the administration is to
provide service to this corpus'.’_’

Pitt as a Regional University:

“There "are several favorable I

trends towards expanding the

constituency of the. University- I L

It is important to maintain "a

significant ratio of out-of-state 
students, and it is in the interest .j '
of Pennsylvania students that
Pitt be a cosmopolitan university. I 
The current figures are due al-

most entirely to the shortage of
dormitory space, and this will be‘
corrected in a few years.”

Academic Freedom: “This. is a

fundamental value that must be » A

var emphasized the hnportaxice
of “portraying the full spectrum

A Student Hits
Athletic Dept.

Editor, Pitt News:

The NCAA is dead! They just
committed an act which could
easily disrupt the entire system
and possibly lead to the end of
college athletics. They have elect-
ed Frank Carver vice-president.
Although I just read this in the
Pittsburgh Press, I still carmot
believe that anyone could com-
mit such a blunder, after all, his
own school’s athletic program
has deteriorated to such a point
that it may have to schedule
Point Park and the Pittsburgh
Art Institute in all sports next
fall. What about the great Pitt
athletic program? Well, I've been
here and am a three-year letter-
man in a varsity sport, and here
are some of the inside facts.

When was the last time any-
one saw any of our high-ranking
athletic department officials at a
cross-country meet, a swimming
match, or a soccer game? In my
opinion the man who is responsi-
ble for the entire athletic pro-
gram should attend as many
events as possible. At last year’s
All Sports banquet Frank Carver
completely overlooked the recog-
nition of soccer player George
Sommer who was NCAA All-
American..HoW many Al1-Ameri-
cans are at Pitt? And yet this
was not a case of accidental omis-

sion, Carver actually DID N01‘
KNOW THAT SOMMER HAD
MADE ALL-AMERICAN, which
was officially announced three
months before the banquet.

In this school athletes have
practically no identity. You
spend exhausting and punishing
hours of practice, only to have
to beg for a basketball to work
out with in the 0R season. I am
not suggesting the ridiculous pol-
icies of the Big 10 and West Coast
where athletes need only to snap
their ﬁngers for almost anything,
including grades. Any soccer
player will tell you that Carver
cares more for local high school
teams than he does for his own
teams. ‘

The budget is another area

. which needs improving. I realize

the troubles the University got
itself into, but the athletic budg-
et seems ridiculous, especially
when you consider that the
wrestling team travels in auto-
moblies, and there is little if any
scholarship help for minor sports.

I could write 20 pages full of
incidents which would make you
roll on the ﬂoor and die laugh-
ing. To express my, feelings ex-
actly, “The athletic program at
this school stinks.” It’s time to
clean house, and cleaning‘ house

means starting with the main
source of inadequacy — the ath-
letic director. I expect an answer
from the Field House to appear
here filled with wordy and con-
vincing arguments and “facts”
to set me straight.

But I have been here too long.
What I have written here are ac-
counts which I know exist. This
is not the letter of a frustrated
athlete seeking revenge, but that
of a fairly successful athlete
(despite overwhelming odds in
the AD office) who is completely
disgusted. Since I have not yet
graduated and have an athletic
scholarship, I am asking that
you withhold my name. I would
like to keep my scholarship.

Shidemantle Leads

By ANDY swmrrz

For the past six_ years co-
ordination, imagination, and
originality have been three
aspects of Dave Shideman-
tle’s everyday life. Since his
high school days at Butler, Pa.
in which he was runner up in the
state ﬁnals on the horizontal bar
and long horse, he has vaulted to
the Eastern championship‘ on the
long horse, ranked fifth in the
nation.

Dave originally became inter-
ested in gymnastics following the
accident while diving on his high
school swimming squad. He ad-
mittedly may never have entered
this sport otherwise. His Butler
high gymnastics squad never lost
a meet during that period or
since. Incidentally Ig Perez and
Jim Sacco, presently co-captains
of the gymnastic team, were
teammates of his.

In gymnastics each individual
makes his own movements for
each event and Dave has found
that originality is important.

“Each participant tries to co-
ordinate his own moves with his

personality such that he will be

able to do the trick which best
that good style adds to good form
suits his style.” Shidemantle feels
which in gymnastics is continuity
‘and precision in-each event.
“Gymnastics is like writing a
good essay with several transi-
tion sentences. Each move you
make while participating in an
event, especially the floor exer-
cises must have continuity with
the rest of your performance.”
$hidemantle’s favorite event is
the floor exercise which basical-
ly- consists of tumbling. Once
again continuity of movement is

DAVE EMANTLE runs through his routine in the floor exer-
cises. The Eastern ‘champion on the long horse originally only became
interested in gymnastics after an accident while on the swimming

team at Butler High. \

most important. He is presently
performing in three events: floor

exercise, long horse, and on the,

trampoline. He has yet to ﬁnish
less than third in any of these
events this year.

However it has been a rough
start for Dave Shidemantle due
to a freak accident in early No-
vember while practicing for _the
upcoming season. Since he broke
hislfoot, Coach Warren Neiger
has gradually phased him into
certain events. Last year, Shide-
mantle dislocated his elbow and
only competed in two meets be-
fore the Eastern championships
in which he took the only first
place for Pitt. E

Neiger feels that Shidemantle
could have been an all-around
man or at least able to partici-

pate in six events if it wasn’t for
his two injuries. Presently, Shide-
mantle is down to 145 pounds
which is exactly where he wants
to be and feels in top, physical
shape, excepting one taped foot.

In commenting on the teams
losing record, Shidemantle said,
“No one likes to be a loser and
I'm disappointed in the schools
support for the team. I feel that
a gymnast is somewhat of a
“showman” and it definitely
helps if people are there to watch
you. Student support adds incen-
tive to me and ﬁres up the en-
tire team. I am concerned about
my individual performance like
everyone on the team, however,
we are all out there representing
the University of Pittsburgh" and
proud of it.”

Pitt Alumnus

Horwitz Now LBJ Aid

by MARTHA HARTLE
Because of the current
struggle in Vietnam the De-
fense Department has taken

the spotlight in the Presi- I

dential cabinet. Along with
the department itself, Secre-
tary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara and his staff have also

- been making headlines.

University alunrmi boast one of
these headliners—Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense Solis Horwitz.
Horwitz was appointed to the
position by President Johnson in
1964 after spending several years
in governmental service.

As Assistant Secretary of De-
fense, Horwitz serves as princi-
pal staff assistant to the Secre-
tary for Administration, Manage-
ment, and Organization. He is al-
so the principal advisor to the
secretary for the National Com-
munications System.

Born November 2, 1910, Hor-
witz entered the University in
1927. He received an AB. degree
in 1930, an AM. in 1932, and
went on to receive a L.L.B. de-
gree at Harvard Law School. The
University awarded him an Hon-
orary Doctor of Law degree in
1964.

Included among his campus ac-
tivities were Phi Alpha Theta, Pi
Tau Phi, and Phi Beta Kappa
(alumni). Current activities re-
lated to the University include
executive board of Washington,
D.C., University Alumni Chapter.
He served as regional agent for
the annual giving fund in 1960-
61.

Horwitz practiced law in the
Pittsburgh area from 1937-42.
During World War II he served
as a Japanese language specialist
with army intelligence and later

wrote the summary for the
Tokyo War Crime Trials.

Prior to his appointment as As-
sistant Secretary of Defense, the
University alumnus served as Di-
rector of , Organizational and
Management Planning in the Of-
ﬁoe of the Secretary of Defense.
This department was created by
McNamara in 1961.

Horwitz has also held a num-
ber of positions as counsel or in-

_ vestigator for congressional com-

mittees. These include counsel for
Senate Committee on Govern-
mental Operations, general coun-
sel for Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, counsel for Senate
Majority Policy Committee, coun-
sel for preparedness subcommit-
tee of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and consultant to -the
the National Security Resources

-Stone Named

Chairman To
CED Board

Donald C. Stone, dean of the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA)
has been appointed to two posts
on the Committee for Economic
Development (CED). He will
serve as chairman of its Advis-
ory Board on Improvement of
Management in Government and
will become a member of the
Committee’s Research Advisory
Board.

of about 250 trustees, most of
whom are heads of major United
States. corporations. It publishes
policy papers from its studies of
economic, social, and public is-
sues of national importance.

Sibelius Concerto  

Performed Tonight

By ADRIENNE MILLER

This evening at the Syria Mosque, violinist Szymon
Goldberg will perform the Sibelius Violin Concerto iii D
Minor with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and guest
conductor Witold Rowicki. Like Beethoven, Brahms, Men-
dlessohn and Tchaikovsky before him, Sibelius wrote but
one violin concerto. Unlike the aforementioned composers,

however, Sibelius was himself an
accomplished violinist.

Sibelius wrote his Violin Con-
certo in 1903, then in 1905, at
the age of forty, he revised it.
He has described its ‘first per-

formance thus, “In October 1905,’

my violin concerto, in its revised
and ﬁnal form, stood its Baptism
of ﬁre in Germany at a concert
in the Singakademic in Berlin.
The solo part was played by‘ Karl
Valir and the accompaniment was
conducted by ‘none other than
Richard Strauss.

Sibelius is one of the few great
composers to receive recognition
during his lifetime. The violin
concerto is lyrical, melodius and
romantic.

More than most contemporary
composers, Sibelius has suffered
from the “interpretations” cri-
tics have read into his music.
One critic once remarked that if
he had not stopped to look at an
atlas where he observed that
Sibelius’+native Finland is “most-
ly flat and water-logged with
lakes,” he would have written
that the Violin Concerto was
hewn out of the rocks of Fin-
land’s mountains.

Still_ another writer was re-
minded by the slow second move-
ment of the composer brooding
over his lost youth. The same
commentator heard in the ﬁnal
movement “an ancient folk song

_ in .which the careless bravery

had been replaced by a kind of
contemplative death.” No won-

der Sibelius hated critics. But no
matter what interpretations cri-
tics give to his concerto, all agree

-that it is exciting and beautiful

music.
