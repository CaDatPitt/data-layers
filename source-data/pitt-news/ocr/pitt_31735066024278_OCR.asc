Spinners No-Shows
Cost PPC Thousands

By BETH lNGOLD

The Pill News Staff Writer

The cancellation of he Spinners’)

appearance, due to low ticket sales,
took a $7,500 chunk out of the Stu-
dent Activities Fund. .

The Pitt Program Council (PPC)
cancelled the January 29 concert at
the Syria Mosque because only a
little more than 300 tickets had been
sold. But, in fulfilling the contract,
the PPC had to pay 50 percent ofthe
group’s fee. 1

“It’s normal procedure that artist
will get 50 percent of whatever they
normally would have been paid,
when the producer cancels,” said
Henry Morris, program coordinator

"of the PPC.

“You make the decision that you
would lose more money to go with
the concert than to pull out at a
given time. If they had appeared, the
cost would have been more than
$15,000 because there’s a lot more
cost to a concert thanjust the artist's
pay,” he said.

Joyce Giangarlo, advisor to PPC,
said, “We had to make the decision
whether it was easier to lose $7,500
or wait it out, maybe getting a thou-
sand people at the show and spend-
ing $20,000. ’ .

‘‘It was really traumatic becauseit
was the first decision we made to
cancel something simply because we
were just not sure of the attendance.
We felt comfortable that the
audience would probably increase,
but we didn’t want to take that

'chance with student money,” she

said.

“There’s no general policy,” Mor-
ris said. “You have to take every
concert for itself and make decisions
as you go along. lfthe concert was a
lot less expensive, we may have still
went on.”

Buddy Allen, the Spinners’ man-
ager, refused to comment, saying he
didn’t want to get involved in any
issue concerning the fee The
Spinners received.

“It's over. it’s a thing of the past.

0 The cancellation occurred and we

accept that. We don’t want to dwell
on it,” he said.

Giangarlo said she doesn’t believe
the problem wasjust misjudging the
Spinners’ popularity.

“I think it also had a lot to do with
the fact that The Pitt News didn’t
print for part of the first week of
school and the week of the concert.

“We get minimal support from the
newspaper in terms of promoting
short of paidadvertising and paid
advertising can only say so much
about something,”_she said.

“The Spinners should be name
recognition,” Morris said. “They’ve
had a name for an extended period
of time so you would think the stu-
dents, for the name’s sake, would go
to hear them. But obviously we mis-
read_ something. They’re obviously
not exceptionally ‘hot’ at this time.”

Morris said he believes low ticket
sales were caused by a number of
contributing factors such as enter-
tainment competition in an urban
area, advertising, and .“misreading
the students’ perceived needs.”

Pitt Police Go F o P

The Pill News Staff Writer

The Pitt_ campus" police . voted '

Wednesday to allow the Fraternal
Order of Police (FOP), Lodge 99, to
be their collective bargaining repre-
sentative with 39 votes for represen-
tation, two votes‘ for ‘no
representation, and 15 votes which
were challenged by the university. ,

The 15 ‘votes were challenged on
the basis that some officers partici-
pating in the election, the shift com-
manders and the sergeant in‘ charge
.of detectives, were upper manage-
mentilevel personnel and thereby
excluded from voting by state labor
laws, and that other officers had not
completed their six month proba-
tionary period of employment with
the campus police, according to
police chief William Tucker.

j‘l’m pleased. with the outcome of
the election and I am also pleased
with the overwhelming amount of

H support that the officers gave to the
FOP,”’ said Sgt. James Chester of
the campus police'and president of
FOP Lodge 99. — -

The campus police had previously
been represented by the United
Plant Guard Workers of America

vania State Labor Relations Code,

A ‘Renaissance 11
extension’ for the
Oakland area.

"By FREDERICK BEERS

Pill News Staff Writer

Problems in the institutional-
community relationship «are being
addressed in a comprehensive
manner through the implementation
of The Oakland Plan.

The plan, still in its infancy, is
aimed at redeveloping the area by
attempting to "overcome Oakland's
problems by working with its exist-
ing scale,” rather than calling for
sweeping changeshas other plans
have. '

Developed over a period of l8
months by Oakland Directions Inc.
and Urban Design Associates, the
plan combines the interests of all
sectors of the community—-
students, institutions, residents, city
agencies, businesses, developers,
employees, and public repre-
sentatives—into a "policy work-
book," which sets up guidelines,
makes recommendations for prob-
lems, and sets up the mechanism for
implementation.

The plan has been described as a
”Renaissance ll extension" to
include Oakland.

The first step toward the ultimate
goal-—”to upgrade the quality oflife,
work, and recreation in Oakland
and the welfare of the Oakland
citizens”—is the implementation of
a two-year plan.

' Apartments on loulsa street

After identifying Oakland's
problems—-institutional growing
pains, limited and chaotic traffic and
parking, and a rapidly declining
housing situation--the Ol)l Plan-
ning Committee outlined the two-

year plan, which is described in the
fundable. ‘

document as ”realistic.
and unanimously endorsed by all
constituents."

The progress ofthe two-year plan
was described as ”fair to good" by
City Planner Raymond Reaves.

The city will he funding upwards
of $5 million toward the two-year

_ budget, according to initial figures

Jack Freeman, vice-chancellor of

 administration at Pitt. said the pro-

gress of Pius part in the plan,
approximately SI8 million for the
remodeling of Schenley H_all and the

He added that there is sufficient
agreement among parties involved,
and that the university will presently
be meeting with the appropriate city
and community authorities and
selecting an architect. .

Public opposition in the past has
hindered any housing’ proposals
from becoming reality.

People's Oakland spokesperson
Kathy Boykowycz said “more fia-
nancing, more input“ is needed to
really get the plan moving. . .

Aside from the improvements at
Pitt, the two-year plan essentially
calls for the following:

Institutional: in addition to the
university projects, first-phase rene-
wal of the University Health Center
of Pittsburgh (UHCP), to be funded
by the UHCP.

Traffic and Parking: synchroniza-
tion of traffic signals, a new circula-
tion system, a design for
reorientation of Schenley Plaza,
new parking facilities, and residen-
tial sticker parking to be funded by
the city and UHCP.

Residential: housing rehabilita-
tion, scattered site housing for the
elderly, and landscaping .to be
funded by the city, the Department
of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, business developers, and land- .
lords.

Commercial: business and public
improvements, to be funded by busi—/
ness developers.

Joel Etinger, UHCP planner, said
the UHCP will “take a look at the
Oakland plan as it currently exists
and see what we can impliment dur-
ing the next two years."

said. —

He added, however, that the trail
will be delayed by the closing oftwo
Schenley Park bridges.

Reaves said of the design for reo-
rientation of Schenley. Plaza, that
the city is “defining what it wants to
do there.” He explained that the
parking authority, the university,
and Carnegie Institute have met,
and that the parking authority is
“getting people to do the final
designs on cost and breakdowns.”

Residents around Magee
Women‘s Hospital have requested
the sticker parking, Reaves said, but
he added that he’s not sure the city
can ‘accommodate them because of
the ques:§o.~ at what to do with the
displaced cars »

New park. ‘ facilities, he said,
include locations at Darraugh/ Ter-
race, which is tied in with the UHCP
renewal; Centre/Craig, currently
involved in a legal dispute which
Reaves said, “we'll win": and Fifth-
/Forbe_s/ Bellefield/ Neville, which
he said is tied in with the Schenley
Plaza study. ~‘"~

He added that other i sites are
being considered, such as behind the
Board of Education building.

Residentially, Reaves said, the
city is taking a “closer look at sites-
that had been identiﬁed as possibili-
ties (for rehabilitation), such as the
St. Regis School site and the lsaly’s
site.” '

Boykowycz expressed concern‘
-that

this area——central to her
group—would not get proper atten-
tion because “there’s not much more

community input_now than there-

was before."

Reaves said, however, that hous-
ing was a priority.

PAAR Seeks Change
In High Court Rule

By ROSE M. MCHUGH

Pittsburgh Action Against ‘Rape
(PAAR) is currently involved in
promoting legislation that would
not allow courts to subpoena their
files. ’

Anne Pride, director and fund
raiser for PAAR, said that their
records contain little or no informa-
tion of any value to the courts.

Describing the type of aid PAAR
tries to give its clients, Pride said,
‘?The first question we ask a client (a
victim of sexual abuse) is ‘How are
you?’ We are more interested in the
client’s physical and emotional well-
being, rather than the details of the

rape. We leave that to the police.” *

PAAR said it feels it should have
the right to grant its clients confiden-
tiality. Currently, physicians: lawy-
ers, schools and psychologists have
that right.

In October a case came up in
which Common.Pleas Judge Ralph
Cappy subpoenaed the files of a

_ woman, a client of PAAR. She was

willing to share the information with
the judge, but feared the defense
attorney. On her behalf, Anne Pride
refused to relinquish the files. As a
result, Judge Cappy sentenced Pride
to jail.

Pride ducked the sentence by
receiving a stay and then preparing
legal briefs that argued the right to
confidentiality of the victim and the
consulting service. Furthermore,
they claimed the files contained no
direct statements or quotesmade by
the client and therefore are not
applicable in court.

-o--o------------------ . . . . --

On January 22, the Supreme
Court justices ruled that the rape

victim center did not have the right .

to confidentiality and the files must
be released. However, they also
ruled that a hearing be held to deter-
mine ifthe information in the files is
relevant.

On February.9, Judge Cappy once
again opened the case which had
been hanging since October. Giving
heed to the new decision, Pride was
questioned by thejudge, the defense
attorney, and PAAR attorney Anne
Begler. Questions such as “When
were the records’made?”~ and “Do
they contain direct statements?"
were answered during the hearing’.

Pride reported that the hearing
went well — that Judge Cappy did
not look at the records. A

/

Although this woman"s confiden-

tiality was retained, two other

women’s in Delaware and Montgo-
mery counties were not. Their files
were released and according to
Pride, did not meet the criteria of the
Supreme Court decision.

Pride and others associated with
PAAR would like to see legislation
passed , that would decide deﬁni-
tively that rape crisis centers could
offer clients complete conﬁdential-
ity through complete privacy of files.

Said Pride, “We’re not sitting
around on this, we feel that we need
this legislation instantly. Our clients
need it and it is a lot of work — l
have 20 subpoenas waiting to be
answered.

Faculty and "research assistants
from the University of Pittsburgh
have prepared hitherto classified
transcripts of executive sessions of
the United States House Committee
on Foreign Affairs. The ten volumes
cover 1951 to 1956, offering a por-
trait of post—World War II foreign
policy in the process of develop-
ment. According to project director
Harold L. Hitchens, the volumes
hold a mirror up to our recent past
and provide important clues to the
complex of America in the l980s.

The volumes cover a couple of
topics including the formal end of
World War ll, the American role in
NATO’s buildup, the Korean War
and its aftermath, and foreign pol.-
icy readjustments required in light of
the Communist takeover in China
and the French loss of Southeast
Asia. Hitchens claims that the infor-
mation often provides a refocus of
historical perspective.

For example, Hitchens finds it
interesting that Secretary of State
Dulles, commonly regarded as the
hapwkish hard-line architect of
America’s massive retaliations, sev-
eral times warned the Committee in
closed sessions against the involve-
ment of U.S. ground troops in Sou-
theast Asia. Hevinsisted that the
American people will not stand for
makinglndo-.China another Korea.

The transcripts also foreshadow
the gordian problems of the l980s:
energy and the Middle East. In 1953,
for example, a witness told the Sub-
committee on the Near_ East and

Africa that, in the abscence of cer-
tain actions, there would be a global
shortage by 1975. Also, in 1954,
Gov. Harold Stassen, then director
of the Foreign Operation Adminis-
tration, pointed out that the people
of Iran who were “anti-Shah" were
also “anti-U.S'.” In the 1950s,, said
Hitchens, “this was not commonly
absorbed.”

Hitchens said, “I think that these
volumes are one of the more impor-
tant sources for studying our foreign
policy as it is developed in the years‘
following World War 11. They espe-
cially throw light on the role ofCon-
gress in the development of
American foreign policy."

These volumes represent a con.-
tiuation of a similar series prepared
by Pitt which covers 1943 through
l950. They all were prepared under

an arrangement between the Com-“‘

mittee on Foreign Affairs and the‘
University Center for International
Studies (UCIS). Pitt faculty and
research assistants selected mate-
rials of historical interest from the
Committee’s files in the National
Archives and prepared introduvtory
and background materials and
annotated the texts.

According to project director Hit-7

chens, senior research associate in
UCIS, ‘the Committee,‘ through its-

chairman Representative Clement J. V

Zablocki (D-Wis.), indicated its
desire to make available the maxi-
mum amount of its record that
might be of interestto the public and
to scholars. P i

been the enhancement ofthe univer-

said, “The international dimension
of the university has changed over
the years, and I like to think my
work with our professional schools
had somethingto do with building
and strengthening it.”

For example, he served as a con-
sultant in establishing a degree pro-

committal.”

Tourists in the Lancaster area, as
well as local residents, often head to
the Wilbur Chocolate Factory’s

“We also find soft-center items do
real well. There’s not much demand
in this area for molded chocolate
hearts,” said Bill Medlicott, store
manager. _

He also finds many shoppers put

Evaluating

    Evaluations

It is rare that Pitt gets caught with its academic pants
down in the public arena, and it is even rarer when the
univerisity is objectively criticized by an outside evaluator.
But the fact remains that the more constructive criticism the
better, so naturally we were interested when both of these
evaluative aspects were published as the result of a report
issued by the Middle States Association of Colleges and
Schools. _

Interested, but also surprised by some of the confusing,
and simplistic, so-called recommendations of the evaluation
team outlined in their nine “major” recommendations. For
instance, if Pitt’s administration were to apply these
recommendations: ‘

—Pitt would plead to the state for increased common-
wealth suport while at the same time telling the state to keep
its “regulatory” and auditing hands out of Pitt's business;

—Pitt would seriously consider “program reductions or
closures“ while at the same time: constuct a new building for
the Graduate School of Business, renovate the offices of the

philosophy and mathematics departments, and relocate the
classics department out of Hillman Library;

 

pinion  

 

 

——and, -among other things, streamline the university
bureaucracy while at the same time forming “regional ‘Blue
Ribbon’ Joint Planning Effort Commitee” for the evalua-
tion of the two-year regional camuses at Greensburg and
Titusville.

To expand on this recommedation that Pitt step up its-

efforts to secure additional funding from the state while
maintaining autonomy at the same time, we find the basic
issue of give-and-take to be completely absent in this reason-

" ing. Simply stated, if Pitt and the other state-relateds seek
/ additional commonwealth support in the form of preferred

status in the General Funds budget, then they had better be
prepared to give up some of their autonomy from the state
intrinsic in the ciiurent arrangement.

At a recent press conference Gov. Dick Thornbugh
summed it up in his response to House Bill I58, which would
give the state-relateds preferred status: “I guess the long and
the short of it is that non-preferred status will be changed to
preferred status at some cost to the independance of those
institutions...”

As for the suggestion that “serious consideration be given
to program reductions or closures on order to prevent
serious deterioration of quality,” we can’t help but notice the
inconsistency between this statement and a subsequent one
urging the “need for additional space for academic and
research programs...” In this case there is a sense of ill-

percieved priorities on the part ofthe evaluators; would they
prefer Pitt cut programs while appropriating funds for
expensive construction projects? Hence. the evaluators
would probably have been overwhelmed when the Salk Hall
renovation and dental‘annex were completed in I967 at a
total cost of $8.2 million, $l.4 million of which was picked
up by Pitt and the rest picked up by thestate; $1.4 million I10
doubt put to good use, but which could have been equally
been applied to the creation of new dental or medical aca-
demic programs. —

These two cases ofincompatible positions within the Mid-
dle States evaluation report indicate the difficulties inherent
on any evaluation conducted by outside or semi-related
agencies. Due to a.number of factors predicated by the
infrequency of on-site evaluations, a lack of time for effec-
tive communication between the evaluator and the institu-
tion, and the confusion between stated institutional concepts
and actual conditions, one can only get the sense that this
and subsequent evaluations were conducted in a vacuum.

But this does not mean that evaluations such as this be
discontinued; it simply means that the recommendations
they propose remain simply that—-recommendations. As,
stated at the beginning of-this editorial, the Middle States’
recommendations were confusing and simplistic in their
approach to university problems, but by the sametoken they
serve to increase the awareness of these problems.

U.S. Is Actual Offenderln Iranian, Hostage Crisis    

Dear Editor: ‘
I had almost gotten

through the hostage crisis without a
whimper, but‘ Chris Clinton‘s
column in Friday's paper really
makes me lose patience. Clinton is
quite right that the whole episode is
a slap in the face of the American
people; the offender, however, is the
U.S. government which so blithely,
indeed eagerly, contributed to the
conditions that caused the revolu-
tion and then did not have the min-
imal sense required to step out ofthe
way ofthe material going to the fan.

I find it hard to understand why
people should take to heart the fate
of a few bureaucrats when there are
so many more pressing and substan-
tial problems—or rather, I do
understand and it depresses me.
Americans think that these foreign
service officers are "our" boys and
girls. While it is true that we must
pay taxes and contribute in other
ways to the enterprise of U.S.
government, we have no more to do
with State Department decisions
than we do with the policies of Gen-
eral Motors (or Chrysler, to use a
more apt example).

If the hostages were ”our" boys
and girls, there would probably have

I i been no revolution, because the boys

and girls would not have installed
the Shah in the first place, back in

I ~ . I953. They would not have trained

the Shah's secret police, they would
._ not have dumped tens_of billions of
dollars of weaponry on this medie-
val country, they would not have
totally ignored the mass opposition

A. - movements. But they didn't ask us,
they asked the Shah. If they were
i’ _"(_>ur”_boys,and girls, the Sl1_2l_I,W_,0tIld_'

 

contracts; - _- -_ , _
Moreover, Ilnlike; the ‘rest .«of=.us.'. -

not have been permitted into the
U.S. But they didn't ask us‘, they
asked David Rockefeller.

As for the Iranian ”atrocities,"
they were certainly naughty. I myself
would never want a tooth knocked
out, and I always resented my pro-
fessors for the months of mental
stress and boredom I was forced to
undergo.

I imagine it's much worse for that
creme de la creme that gets into the
foreign service. But any resident of
the Shah's jails, or of most American
prisons for that matter, wouldjump
at the chance to suffer such atroci-
ties. Some hundreds of millions of
people under regimes withwhich the
U.S. government has similarly cozy
arrangements (as it’ did with the
Shah) would definitely improve
their living standards if they could
somehow contrive to get captured
by fanatic Iranian terrorist mobs.

As to the innocence of the hos-
tages, one should always give the
benefit of the doubt where possible.
Undoubtedly these nice cleancut
types were in genral as reluctant as
the American public to understand
the nature of the less wholesome
activities of the U.S. government
and U.S. corporations in Imperial
Iran. But at some point we stop tak-
ing ignorance as an excuse. We don't
generally have much sympathy with
the guy who jumps off a skyscraper
expecting to fly, just because he is
not acquainted with Newtonian
gravitation ‘theory. Similarly, those
intimately associated with a corrupt
and brutal regime should expect
some consequences of that associa-
tion- beyond the" caviar’ and

   

 

  

these people chose to take an active
role in the government enterprise, in
exchange for the chance to rub
elbows with ministers and presidents
and billionaires and perhaps to
become one of them.

Whether they always agreed with
the policies set is immaterial. The
range of possible U.S. policies is

very predictable, and these good i

bureauacrats always do as they are
told. Few mercenaries have inspired
-such lyrical outpourings as these 52.

Now, it may well be true, as one of
the hostages claims, that Americans
were never officially present in the
SAVAK torture chambers. Seems to
me we've heardthat one before, at
Nuremberg. Or to put it another
way, Good Massa never has to w-hup
his slaves, because he can always
hire some "trash" to do the dirty
work,'or threaten them with sale to
the Bad Massa. '

Many Americans have swal-
lowed, eagerly or otherwise, the pab-
lum that we're all one big happy
family with the same purpose and
ideals. That is not true. Kissinger got
his regional policeman, the oil com-
panies and Chase Manhattan got
vastly increased profits, the war
industry got the ideal customer: an
unlimitable wealthy addict. We got
ruinous oil prices and disrupted

supply lines. and the contempt ofthe '

world for our government-'s choice
of Johns. .

Now the official line proposes to
renew precisely the policy that
helped cause the revolution and the
embassy seizure, and can only lead

to more of the same: "get tough with .
the terrorists." Terrorists, of course,

‘RansomMoney’— Pay Now Or No Dental Diploma Later

“Dear Editor:

“Lordy, won’t you buy me a den-
tal degree?”

The University of Pittsburgh has
issued yet another edict which will
serve to pad the pockets of the
bureaucrats. They are demanding
tuition money, yet are denying edu-
cation. The school is proving once

again that a university education has
become big business.

Ten dental students completed all
academic requirements and spent
$20,000 to graduate in December,
1980. That‘s what the diplomas say,
the ones that are still in the hands of
the Dental School and not in the
hands ofthe students, who must still

pay $2,400 “ransom" to get them.
Where is thejustice in paying tuition
after graduation? Money has
become the name of the game.
Conversations with the school’s
deans in early January implied the
attitude of “Well, if it was up to me,
you wouldn’t have to pay.” Two of
the students somehow managed not

Hats Off To The Health Service

Dear Editor:
Student Health Service,
which is located at 204 Bracken-
ridge, generally goes unnoticed for
their amazing ability to keep a uni-
versity of over 7000 students alive
and well. l-t seems that the only
recognition that the nurses and doc-
tors of the addition to the residence
hall receive is from sick people at
their time of need...after which they
are forgotten. -

ls unfortunately was one of those
sick people recently and because of

the great care and attention that was
given me by the Student Health Ser-
vice, I felt that the credit and recog-
nition they deserve should be made
known.

This university-operated service,
which costs all full and part-time
students the small amount of$2l per
term, offers many opportunities.
lncluded are allergy shots, derma-
tology, general medicine, gynecol-
ogy, internal medicine, and even lab
work and minor out-patient surgery.
Also offered are prescription and

over-the-counter drugs at a reduced
rate and pamphlets on all sorts of
topics.

The Student Health Service is
available for any student that has
paid his fee. It is open from 8:00 a.m.
until ‘l 1:00 p.m. and there is no limit
on the number oftimes a student can
go there. They are helpful foralmost
any problem the troubled student
may have. -

LA C Explains A rrest Procedures

NOTE: This column is based on
information from a publication of
the Community Release Agency
titled “What Happens When You
Get Arrested?" The information is
reprinted with the permission of the
Community Release Agency.

Hopefully there will never be any
reason for you to be arrested. If you
should be arrested, however,
whether or not you have committed
crime, you should be aware of what
will happen to you, what your rights
are, and where you can go for help.

If you are arrested, do not resist
the officers even if you feel that you
should not be arrested. This could

. lead to additional charges against



 

you. Be cooperative; the police offic-
ers are doing their duty.

You should be told at the time of
your arrest that you have the right to
remain silent, and that anything you
say can be used against you in a
court of law. You are not required to
tell the officers anything except your
name and address. It is in your best
interests to remain silent until you
can speak to an attorney.

_You will»be taken to the Public
Safety Building in downtown Pitts-
burgh where, within six hours of

your arrest, you will be booked (the t

arrest will be entered into the police

records), photographed, finger-'

printed, and your possessions will be
removed from your person (you will
be given a receipt, which you should
retain). You will be arraigned (told
of the charge against you and the
amount of your bail)."/

You may be allowed to make one
phone call. It is to your advantage to
contact someone who can post bail
and contact an attorney for you.
You will be interviewed by someone
from the County Bail Agency. Since
this person will recommend the
amount ‘of your bail, you should
"cooperate with this person and
answer all questions truthfully.
There are several types of bail and
releases: release on one‘s own recog-
nizance, release under supervision
percentage, straight and surety.
These will be discussed in a later
Legal Awareness Column.

When you are arraigned, the
judge or magistrate will inform you
of the charges against you, present
you with a copy of those charges.’

jail before the preliminary hearing.
At the arraignment you may be
given forms to sign. Don’t sign any-
thing until you have read it and fully
understand it, or have spoken to
your attorney.

Three to 10 days after your arrest
you will appear before a magistrate
for your’ preliminary hearing. The
persons who have brought the
charges against you (complaint/ants)
and a representative from the Dis-
trict Attorney's office will be pres-
ent. You must be at the hearing,
accompanied by your legal represen-
tative. The magistrate will decide at
the hearing what charges for the trial
will be held against 'you. He can
change the amount of bail, decide
that there is not enough evidence
against you to take you to trial,‘
reduce the crime to a summary
offense, and order .you to pay a fine,
go to jail, or make restitution to the _
victiin. If the charges are held
against you for the trial, a date for
the formal arraignment will be set.

On the day and time set for you by
the magistrate, you will report to the
Calendar Control office to receive a
written statement of the charges
against you and to be given a date
and time to appear in court for a
trial. You will have to provide proof"
that you will be represented by an
attorney at your trial.

Before your trial, you will decide
how you should plead. You should
tell your attorney all the facts. If you
decide to plead not guilty, you will
have a trial; if you plead guilty, you
will be sentenced by a judge. Your
attorney may advise you to “plea
bargain”-—plead guilty to lesser or
fewer charges in return for a lighter
sentence. The final decision as to
how you plead is yours; your attor-
ney acts as an advisor.

If you pleadinot guilty, your case
will come up for trial.You can give
up your right to ajury trial and have
the case heard by a judge. If you
have a jury trial, thejury will decide
what charges you are guilty of. if
you waive the right to ajury trial, the
judge ‘will decide your innocence or

' guilt.

lf you -are found not guilty at the

. trial, you will be released and a por-

tion ofthe money you posted for bail
will be returned to you. Court costs,
fines, or restitutions will be deducted
from you bail, andwhatever is left

the rest will be paid ‘back to you.

You can be given any of several
sentences. You may have to pay a
fine, be put on probation, or»s_en‘-
tenced to a_prison term.

If you are arrested. and need help,
there are several agencies in Pitts-
burgh that can help you. If you do
not have an attorney, the Allegheny
County Bar Association sponsers a
lawyer referral service that will be
able to recommend an attorney. This
service can be consulted at 261-0518.
Be sure you find out what the attor-

ney you speak to will charge you for «

his or her services. If you can not
afford an attorney, the court will
appoint a Public Defender to your
case (Public Defender’s office is 355-
5801). ~

You can obtain additional infor-

Credit For Real Learning   ° 

By WENDY WAREHAM

After six years of sporadic stu-
denthood, I have much experience
with the great scramble for credits
while trying to concentrate’ on my
major. I’m not against credit
requirements; I think a distribution
in studies is an essential part of a
good education.

But I would like to propose that
the university adopt a program that
gives credits for all the things stu-
dents learn in and outside the uni-
versity environment. Credits for
living, or learn while you live, or
something like that. This would free
more time for. concentrating ‘on
major courses while still remaining a
full-time student.

” Here are a few sketchy examples:

‘I. Survival l0]: 3 credits. These ’

three credits will be awarded to any
student who successfully survives
two or more years of Oakland living.
After two years, the students should
have a working knowledge of the
following survival techniques: how
to eat ﬁve meals a w.eek,on less than‘
$10, or fifty" ways to prepare Kraff
macaroni and cheese; how to secure
suitable supplies of condiments
from fast food joints,’ trherby saving
from fast food joints, thereby saving
approximately $5 per semester; how
to avoid getting a parking ticket
when you have no change for the
meter; and how to do laundry in one
load bi-monthly.

2. Intro to Money Management:

Panthers Defeat Penn State,70-63

Pitt Makes Big Free
T hro WSDO wn Stretch

BY MIKE DICHIARA
The Pitt News Sports Editor

“We stopped playing communist
basketball. That’s when everybody
gets the same number of shots. We
started playing dictator basketball,
when we order who gets the shots,”
said head coach Roy Chipman fol-
lowing his Panthers’ 70-63 victory
over rival Penn State at the Field
House Wednesday night.

The game was delayed 30 minutes
because the Nittany Lions had trou-
ble getting to the Field House due to
snowy conditions.

“We were sitting around at about
quarter to seven and Penn State still
wasn’t here,” said Chipman. “We
waited and waited and with the
music playing (from the stereo in the
lockerroom), the guys started danc-
ing around and I thought it would
hurt us. We just couldn't sit there
and let the kids get hurt.”

Chipman then talked with the
officials and the 30 minute clock was
started. lf Penn State didn’t make it
by then, the game would have been
forfeited to the Panthers. But the
Lions arrived minutes later and the
game began by 8:30 p.m.

Pitt’ opened the game strongly and
took an early 10-4 lead. Sam Clancy,
who was the game’s high scorer with
27 points, opened the Panther attack
with two free throws. He added
another point from the line and
Carlton Neverson pumped in two
jumpers. Dwayne Wallace scored on

a driving lay—up and Paul Brozovich‘

hit one of two free throws to com-

plete the early Panther spurt. Never-
son and Wallace added balance to
the offense by scoring 14 and 12
points, respectively.

“It was areal big win for us,” said
Neverson. “lt’s three in a row now
and we have momentum toward the
next game.”

The early success for Pitt ended
quickly as Penn State caught up and
passed the Panthers for a 20-l2 lead
with 4:25 remaining in the half.

“They’re so physical,” Neverson
said about the Lions. “They're not
very quick but what they lack in
quickness they make up in being
physical. We just kept banging and
banging and got through.”

Penn State plays the physical
game so well because of their size.
Except for guard Mike Edelman (6-
feet-2 and a half inches), the starting
line-up consisted oi no one smaller
than 6 feet—7.

The Lions used their superior size
to get inside on Pitt and draw fouls.
Wallace picked up three early fouls
and had to sit out a substantial part
of the first half.

“I thought the key for the first
half,” said Chipman, “was when we
lost Wallace. Dwayne’s been doing a
great job for us and when he left, we
could have gone down by as many as
eight or nine points.

“We were able to go with Never-
son and Olinger,” continued the
Panther coach. “Dave did a good
job defensively and helped keep us in
the game.”

Pantherettes  Win Game F
 With Rally In Final Minutes

By MARIE HUFF

The Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pantherettes bounc_ed back 7

from a 45-42 halftime deficit to score
a thrilling 83-78 victory over the

Lady Lions of Penn State. Pitt, now-

l6-5, must overcome the “hex” of '

Friday the l3thas they head for the
nation's capitol to take on Howard
University. '

Penn State drew blood first, Carol
Walderman hitting a jumper six
seconds into the game. The_ two
teams traded baskets until Carol
Dugan connected on a free throw
that brought the Pantherettes within
one, 8-7. Pitt could "not take the lead,
and the Lady Lions used two Wal-
derman jumpers and a three point
play by Cheryl Ellison to build a 19-
13' lead with 12:58 remaining inithe
ehalf.

The Pantherettes, working in
spurts most of the first 20 minutes,
knotted the game at 19-19 on the
strength of two Debbie Lewis lay-
ups. Pitt was still unable to take the

lead, and the Pantherettes scoring-

lapse allowed Penn State. to put
together their biggest lead of the

Panthers Play Well, Beat PennS

After an exchange of baskets, Pitt
opened up a five point lead with
about 14 minutes left in the game.
Wallace hit a I7-footer, then con-
verted one of two shots from the line
to keep the Panthers ahead.

Penn State recaptured the lead by
one, 4|-40, on a short jumper by
Scott Wolz. After another exchange
of baskets, Pitt regained a four point
advantage as Clancy scored on a
spinning jumper in the lane and was
fouled on the play. The free throw
was good and Pitt was up 49-45.

'Clancy hit an excellent l3-for-l4
from the foul line as the entire
Panther team hit the clutch freebies
when they counted. Pitt shot 73 per-
cent from the line and 47 percent
from the floor. The most important
part of the field goal shooting was
that Pitt converted on IS of 26 (58
percent) shots in the second half, a
remarkable improvement over the
36 percent from the floor in the first
half.

Three minutes later, Pitt extended
the lead to five and maintained it
over the rest of the game. For about
five full minutes, each team ran up
and down the court exchanging

baskets.

“I was a little worried,” said
Clancy, “because it seemed as if we
traded about ten baskets apiece. We
couldn't really stop them but when
we made our shots, it relieved the
pressure until they made theirs."

With under two minutes remain-
ing in the game, Penn State still
trailed by five, 64-59, and had to
start fouling. But Pitt responded as
they hadn’t yet this season by bit-
ting six ofeight free throws down the
stretch.

“I think it (successful free throw
shooting) was due to a lot more con-
centration in the game," explained
Neverson.

Wallace connected on the first
two, Neverson hit two more with 48
seconds left, McMillian hit one of
two and Wallace converted one
more. Pitt made the final 70-63 when
Neverson broke loose for a slam
dunk off the fast break with one
second remaining.

“This is probably the best we’ve
played the last three or four minutes
in a game,” said Chipman.‘“Well,
maybe I shouldn’t say that because I
thought we played _well against

Maryland. we didn’t hit the free
throws against Maryland. But we
made them tonight.”

“If there is a better player in the
eastern United States than Sam
Clancy, I’d like to see him. He‘s play-
ing great ball,”Chipman continued.
“Sam said that he wanted the bas-
ketball, he told the guys that he
wanted it. And I wanted him to have
it, too.”‘

Pitt’s record improves to 12-9 on
the season while Penn State falls to
15-8. Pitt’s next game is this Sunday
at the Civic Arena, where the Panth-
ers meet Duquesne in an important
Eastern Eight conference game.

Pitt narrowed the gap by Clancy

hitting a lay-up, Neverson scoring ‘

on an l8-footer and Olinger driving
for a lay-up.» With the Panthers
down by three and the clock winding
down in the half, Lennie McMillian
hit an off—balance, turn-around
jumper from 18 feet to cut the half-
time Lion lead to one, 25-24.

“Their (Penn State’s) defense was
not as tough to crack as it looked,”
said McMillian. “It was just a physi-
cal, rough and tough game."

To the Editor: /

This is to register a friendly but serious complaint about the coverage
accorded by SHOWCASE to theatrical activities on the Pitt campus. The
most recent issue (February 3) is a case in point. Its cover story on Dracula:
Sabbat and its reviews on several other theatrical activities in town pointed
up the absence of a review to the City Theatre Company's La Ronde, now
playing at the Studio Theatre on campus. Notice of that production was

relegated to a blurb in the memos column. _

This is, in fact, typical. A sort of reverse snlobbism seems to govern
editorial policy at SHOWCASE: it seems that ifPitt is doing it, it's somehow
parochial to cover an event. This is a little like Groucho Marx's joke about
not wanting to’belong to any club that would accept him as a member.

Literally dozens of our productions have gone without reviews in the last
several years. SHOWCASE hasconsistently failed to review the produc-
tions acted, directed and designed by their fellow students in the Studio
Theatre; they have rarely reviewed the events of The Floating Theatre, a
Pitt-sponsored program to bring the best of avant-garde professional thea-
tre to the campus; you even failed to review both productions of the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival, an e_ve-nt of national importance, and to which
the WALL STREET IOURNAL gave a full column story. Nor has there
been a single cover story on a Pitt production in my memory. '

It is, I think, a disservice to your fellow students not to keep them
informed of the activities to which they in many cases have privileged
access: I doubt that many students knew of the special discount forthe
Shakespeare , Festival subsidized by the Pitt Programming Council-
probably becausenotice of that discount was restricted to a one—line notice
in a single issue of SHOWCASE. How many students will be prevented ~
from ‘seeinglour next mainstage production of‘Company either because
they'll never find out about it or because," by the time they do, it will be sold
out?

Attilio Favorini, Chairperson
Theatre Arts Department '

. Al. r

‘Editors’ Note: L ‘ 0 . ‘ . , - 0 0 ,
We wish, Mr. Favorini, you would check your facts; we've checked ours.
Of the three productions done by The Three Rivers Shakespeare Festi-

val, two were covered by SHOWCASE,‘a_s well a full-length feature cover- '

‘ ing the Festival in general. Last term, we ran a feature on’the Mainstage

production, to date we have given generousecoverageto every event spon-
sored by The Floating Theatre, and donated front—page coverage to your
production of Hearts and Diamonds. ‘ .

The Pittsburgh theater scene is practically unlimited;~and our space is
quite obviously not. We, as Editors, must pick and choose as we see fairest._
Granted, many people will feel s__hort—changed by this, probably more so
than not. But we do try and cover as broad and as diverse a cFoss—section as
possible. So please, Mr Favorini, be patientl B ’

7"- Floating Theatre Brings NTD To Pittsburgh

BY CHRIS LYNNE

What brought a crowd of both
hearing and deaf to experience
together, the telling of Homer's
classic Illiad .7 On Sunday night, it was
the temporary landing of the Floating
presentation of the
‘National Theater of the Deaf

performing The Illiad, Play By Play.

Through both sign language and
narration, the great story of the
Trojan War unfolded in the form of a
football game between the Greeks
and the Trojans.

The opening act immediately drew
the audience into the tension on stage
as Achilles (Howie Seago) engrosses
himself in the ritual of tackling a
football dummy. So keen was his
silent concentration that nobody
could help but wonder who he seems
to hate. And why does he hate? For
what does he prepare? While these

.questions remain unsettled, four

.‘other players dressed like Achilles
enter, two at each end of the stage.
They face each other'and begin
passing footballs in mechanical
unison. A pendulum rhythm ”tick-

tocks,” undisturbed by Achilles”

unnerving war cries.

The story lightens up, and frames a
picture of modern pro football with
the introduction of a male—female
commentator team (Andy Vasnick
and Jody Steiner) and a few, bouncy
cheerleaders.

The commentators bring the war
into the contemporary frame of
reference as they bark out the action
throughout _most of‘ the play.
Steiner's whiny, sing—song voice
sensationalizes events to the point of

cheapening the gravity of war. With
every "You've just seen it, folks!”
from her, the battle becomes more
like a football game, or modern
football becomes more war-like.

Either way, the parallel is so close
that we have to re-examine one of
our favorite cultural pastimes and ask
if paying to see grown men crunch
heads excuses us ‘from being any less
bloodthirsty than if we were
constantly at war.

world, Helen of Sparta, Paris gave the
prize to the goddess of love. Since
Helen was the wife of a Creek, the
love of Menelaus, the Greeks waged

war with the Trojans in an effort to -

win Helen.
The outstanding singular
performance is then given by

Menelaus (Mike Lamitola) when he
mimes the story of Helen's rather
unusual conception. Helen, it seems,
was fathered by Zeus when he

"...the parallel is so close that we must i
re-examine one ofourfaoorite cultural
pastimes anal ask if it excuses us from
being any less bloodthirsty than if we

were constantly at war.’

4

The popularization of the ancient
war is enhanced by the appearance of
Zeus as a Goodyear blimp and a
commercial with Achilles in the role
oflloe Greene accepting a Coke in a
fond exchange for one of his towels.

Keeping up with the humor, a slide
show presented the story of the
golden apple and how the Trojan War
actually started. A dispute over who
was the most beautiful of 'the
goddesses was settled when Zeus
arbitrarily chose a'Troj'an prince as
the judge. Since Aphrodite promised
him the most beautiful woman in the

appeared to her mother in the form of

a swan.

So imagine the seduction of a
bathing woman by la great white
waterbird, and you've got. a story

easily brushed off in the form of.
However, 1

Greek mythology.
Lamitola so convincingly mimes the
tale, daring the audience toentertain
images-of bestiality, that you may

later wonder about t-he perversion

that must have runrampant in their
culture. "
Lamitola later stirred the audience

  GREEK EPIC SCORES ON FOOTBALL FIELD

fanged, blood thitsty serpent, hissing
and violently assaulting a mother
sparrow. He so completely drew on
his expressive energy, that the
audience surrendered their emotions
to follow wherever his face, hands,
and body would lead.

At half-time the players actively
told the story of the Odyessey. They
presented themselves in band

uniforms with Odyesseus as the:

drum major, ready to give a quick
rundown of the perils of the epic.
With a few mounts and holds‘,
together /the group mimed a ship, a

two-headed monster, and a Cyclops, _

all complete with moving parts.

The formations were a successful
display of their sensitivity to the
pictoral characteristics unique to
each. object. Each of the moving parts
maintained an even beat, and
together they created a musical
h a r m o n y . T h e
reminiscient of an orchestra
accompaning a_ scene to heighten and
direct emotion. '

It is during the second half ofthe 

war that the~anger peaks. The

dimming of the lights, the silence, 2 
and the low circling Greeks and .
Trojaﬁns as they meet one on one, is ,

indicative of the climax of the war.

Misplaced Scientist Deflates Potential Thriller

ALTER-ED STATES

Directed by Ken Russell

Adapted from Paddy Chayevsky’s
book "Altered States" ‘

By ].D. KLEINKE

   

/
,/.

If Altered States makes the big, meta-
phoric splash it promises, it certainly
isn't in Lake Profound.

Take one obsessive physiologist
conducting horrifying genetic
research at the Harvard Medical Col-
lege. Throw in a dash or two of bril-
liance, add a heavy dose of curiosity
and one very peculiar knack for reli-
gious allegory and schizophrenic
consciousness. And what we have" is
science; pure and untampered with
by any of the more foolish sentiments
like morality and so on, but science all
the same.

On second thought, what coalesces
on the screen is not science, but

Director Ken Russell with Blair Brown and W1 iam Hurt

pseudo—science. Pseudo—science
because Dr. Jessup is reckless, impul-
sive,/and just plain irresponsible. He
utilizes laboratory conventions like
the scientific method as readily as he
does chopsticks

 

A great storybook, sci-fi type char-
acter, but certainly no scientist. But
then again, no humanist either. He
tries, but humanists never manage to
escape morality quite as unscathed as
does Iessup. So he's no scientist and

‘he's no humanist; and in actuality,

he's not much of anything. The liter-
ary void the character is caught in
gives him a frightening lack of credi-
bility. As a result, Altered States misses
its target. It should mean more, and it
doesn't. _ R I

William Hurt portrays the moder-
nized version of Dr. Frankenstein,

‘ Iessup. But that particular“19th cen-

tury physiologist was an illusion, a

fantastical creation, and was treated
as such. '

Jessup fills the same niche, but is S
' forced awkwardly onto the screen at

face value. Where Frankenstein was a

pretensions of the film emerge in full
force. _

Jessup is presented in a straight-
faced, laughingly sincere role. And
the mad scientist can never: be sin-
cere. Maybe to himself, but not to the‘
rest- of the rational populace. In
Altered States the sincere scientist runs
around like a madman. ‘

Yes, the film dazzles, it really does.
The concept, the sensibility, the
whole idea that man can regress

within his genetic structure back‘
through his evolutionary past is a

fascinating, if not terrifying notion.
But the endless potential and
power of the theme are caught in the

. than typical Neanderthal

. bottleneck of a film suffering from a

terminal case of tunnelvision. The
focus of the film is the taint that takes
a brilliant premise and does it little
merit. It is the focus indeed, which is
just too narrow.

I-Iurt makes a great effort at bring-

ing out the internalized torment of a,¢/;,..

man searching for the most ultimate
of ultimate truths. Mankind’s abso-
lute infancy is the target; and from its
hopefully realized grasp, the charac-
ter attempts to wrestle the greatest
of all answers. .

But all too soon it becomes obvious
that Hurt does not have the dynamics

to pull it off. The classic -theme of ,

watching a man come systematically
unwound is the approach of filtered
States, but doesn't do justice to the
concentration on his breakdown as a
character. So the focus should natu-
rally shift away frorn—Russell’s fum-
bling an-d mediocre portrayal,
towards the plethora of moral an_d

social implications that the premise of _

the film evokes. However, this does
not happen.‘ ‘ .
Of the many attempts to avert Dr.
Iessup on his collision "course toward
self—destruction, .be they ‘ the’ soft
touch of his wife's love or the slightly
less forgiving touch of his colleagues’
common sense, all are to no avail. Jes-
sup is doomed, and so is the film at
this point. Away it skirts, flavored

.with several confusing sequences

evoking religious allusion, and spat-
tered "with .visual effects that are
nothing short of pure sensationalism.
]essup’s metaphysical masturbation
goes too far, and the film takes a
sharp turn for the absurd. Unfortu-
nate indeed, for within ‘those recur-
ring ‘scenes of actual genetic and
physical regression there's great sty-
listic potential. ’

Dr. Jessup, turned Neanderthal

man, zips through the filthy streets_
of Boston, clothed in nothing other

nothing, and a cloak of faded neon. In

American Film Industry Sinking Amid Problem ‘(Crisis

By LESLIE VANBUSKIRK

Something's wrong with the film
industry. People in virtually every
city from New York to Los Angeles
are shaking their heads and nodding
in agreement to phrases like "They
don't make movies like they used to."
Film directors who don't come
through with a financial hit are being
held solely responsible by the public
and critics alike for a failure( Heaven's
gate's Michael Cimino). Being a
director used to be a revered
profession; now it's often thought of
on the same level as a used car
salesman.

The number one complaint is that
Hollywood studios are allowing far
too much money to be spent on
making a single picture. Movies used
to cost a few million‘ to make, but
average budgets have soared to
anywhere between $10 million and‘
$40 million per picture.

But is it possible that the rising
costs of producing a movie and the
manic egos of directors are
respr visible for the industry's recent
problems? In a way, yes, but in
another way, no; they're merely

I contributing factors. The real cause is

hardly so simple. It is as complicated
and vague as the Hollywood Myth
itself. I

At the top of the pyramid is the
structure of the modern-day studio.
Compared to the set-up during what
has come to be known as the Golden
Age of Hollywood, today's studio is
radically different. Gone are .the
powerful, cigar—chomping. studio
heads who held all the cards and dealt
them as they saw fit. Whether or not
their decisions to produce a picture
were‘ based on careful thought and I
planning, or merely on whim is_

debatable. But what really matters is i

that these men had authority. What
they said, went. Period. ' .
Film, studios are now rurr/by a

group of people and, although the I

title of "chief" or "president" is

delegated to someone, that person is
little more than a figurehead or a
scapegoat. Itylogically follows that
groups take considerably more time
to reach a decison than a single
person. A lot of time is spent
rhetorically discussing, or arguing,

the investor. In order to get these
people interested, the studio must
have the project already set up, with a
director and a star or stars chosen.
Here's where the often-used term
"bankable" comes into play. The
' investment

machine is an

  

sea “
the pros and cons of each project, and
struggling in power plays. It comes as
no surprise that these key executives
are hired and fired in alarming
frequency. Therefore, the main core
of the company is made up of people
who don't know and aren't given the

time to get to know one another well.

enough to work cohesively.

Studios used to run on their own
money. When the decision to make a
picture was finalized, themoney put

up‘ for the budget belonged to the A
studio. Today, however, studios rely '

on banks for money. Loans are made

by the bank with the added cost of

interest, thus escalating the total‘
amount that must. return in pure,

profit in order to make the picture

financially successful. - L
In addition, since studios do not

rely on their own financial reservoir,

they must "sell" an ideafbr a film to ’'

Heaven's

anonymous, automated device with

one purpose: to make ‘money. It has .

absolutely no interest in creating art
unless it turns a profit. To “minimize

' risks, only films with adirector and

stars whose last pictures were)‘
monetary hits are backed up.

This system hasn't worked well in

- recent months. Steven Spielberg was

given the .O.K. to do 1941 at $36
million because of the success of ]aws.

, He put a few biggnames in it, notably

John Belushi, who was considered
bankable because of Animal House, and
investors lined up at his door. But the

’ bankable director and stars made no

difference-—-1941 was a flop. Other
examples include The Blues Brothers
($36 million), Popeye ($20 million),
Raise the‘ Titanic ($40 million), and
Gate ($42 million and‘
counting).

Of the bunch, Heaven's Gate has
garnered the most publicity and
controversy. Although it previewed _.
to the critics only once, it has become . ' I
the target of numerous insults, jokes,’
and gossip. It has become obvious.” I
that Heaven's Gate and its director,

‘Wooden Clogs’ A Beautiful Portrait Of Simple Life

-me TREE or WOODEN CLOGS
Written and directed by Ermanno
Olmi g‘ o

By IANE HOLAHAN

The Tree Of Wooden Clogs is a subtle ii

masterpiece. It's like watching.a bril- 4
liant ballet dancer who makes every-
thing he does look so easy and simple,
yet_ at the same time takes your
breath away. As do all film masterpie-
ces, it asks you to reach for your own
humanity as you reach for the films.
Director and writer Ermanno Olmi _
has brilliantly brought to life a small
peasant farming community in Italy

‘at the turn of the century. Their lives
. are open up to us through dozens of

small scenes, which by themselves

mean little, but put toghether tell a
larger story. This is not easy ‘to do.
Too often films in this vein turn out
to be pretentious and empty.

The Tree Of Wooden Clogs j wofks so

beautifulliy because Olmi knows how ‘

to delve into his characters and make‘

us care about them without making "

up plot and action. We can watch, for

example, ayoung widow go through

her day to day life; from doing

laundry to sitting and knitting, and .

care about her and her life.
'Nothing’extraordin"a'ry happens in
‘the film, it only concerns a year in the
life of this smal-1 farming community,
yet Olmi leaves the viewer feeling

'that'the_ir lives, simply for the sheer-

.simplicity of them, are extraordinary.

It is no minor achievement to make
an audience care so deeply about'the
ordinary lives of these people.

The cast, which is made up entirely ,

of amateur ‘actors, is, without excep-

, tion, extraordinary. In fa_ct._the film

has the feel of a documentary, as
thoughthese people are living their

~.lives and‘the camera just happens to

be watching them. After observing a
r in their lives, you feel as though V
you kiiow them, have always known
them and always will. Their lives go
deeper than the fil_m—they become
part ‘of your life. ' i _ ‘ . '
Yet Olmi is very subtle about eve- -
rything. T-heir humanity comes
through minor action, so you getto

rience rather than being...‘y-t:old=‘

irony accessible to today's filmmak-
ers is in full gear. Accompanying a
pack of homeless street dogs, the
much ”altered" Jessup plays the
primal act better than he does the
modern.

‘The’ scenario is a classic. On the
screen pre-historic man tangles with

the perils of urban America,,and' the ‘

whole concept is quite humorous.
But all too soon, Jessup is back in

the modern flesh, and with the weak-

est ofthernatic pulse. When he ‘pro-

the vain hope _of salvaging }essup's

Susan Gillis graduated from

Pitt with a masters degree in

polished her talent in New
York with the Virginia Laid-

Shoestring Dance Ensemble.
An opportunity came up when
the Dance Alloy began to
perform professionally and
Susan snatched up the offer to

Pittsburgh. She then joined
Kevin Maloney, a Pitt Gradu-

four other choreographers;
the two collaborated on the
six reperatoire highlights to be

Susan describes the first "A

piece done to music by Albi-

fun to dance but technically
demanding." Created by
Rebecca Rice Flanigan, it is a
celebration of dance for a
quartet of women, where the
energy and brightness
express the dancers’ joy of
moving freely. Both Kevin and
Susan strongly favor the
second dance, L’/iuto as their
pet piece because it is the

most visually frenzied and

ballet, men are more retricted,

can use individuality. It allows

_Of the car piece, Kevin says,

feel that L’/luto is a representa-

Susan describes the plot as a A
parable of metropolitan life.

Michael Stanley: Midwest Return T

\ THE MICHAEL STANLEY BAND

Stanley Theatre

I Friday, February 6, 1981

BY DAVID KOVACH

Pittsburgh was treated to music I

from the ”Heartland" recently when
the Michael Stanley Band took the
stage for two shows at the Stanley
Theatre'_s ‘new, over-2'1 club setting.
The seven-member outfit tried their
damndest to win over a polite, but
less than enthusiastic crowd with a

-steamy, power—packed performance

at the 8:00 show. Although the
audience was clearly unfamiliar with

V most of the material, they finally ’

came alive toward the end of the two-
hour set. '

The Michael Stanley Band hails

V from the Cleveland/Youngstown

area where they are the most popular
item since sliced bread. The band
recently had no problem selling out
two shows on New Year's Eve and
New Year's Day at the Richfield Coli-
seum in Cleveland, which is compa-
rable to our Civic'Arena. While there
are other pockets of support around
the country, most areas are still unfa-
miliar with the band's. music. Pitts-
burgh is one suchyarea. Over" the past

three years, scheduled Pittsburgh‘

appearances for the band have turned
into a series of last minute cancella-

tions‘. However, in an effort to
reverse’ this trend-, they have played

alone. Along with some recent radio
support, perhaps the momentum can
start building.

As could be_expected, the music
consisted of material from the new
Heartland album, along with their best
known tunes from Greatest Hints and
Cabin Fever. The band chose to skip
their slowly‘ building anthem,
”.Midwe_st Midnight," in favor of
diving right into ”I'll Never Need

Anyone More (Than I Need You .

,Tonight),’’ from the Heartland record.

DOUBLE FANTASY
J.ohn Lennon and Yoko Ono

K Geffen Records

In the next to last song on
Double Fantasy Yoko Ono sings;
Every man has a woman who loves
him/If he finds her in this life time/He
will know. John Lennon was
luckier than most. He knew.

_Doul7le Fantasy, -subtitled A
Heart Play, is about being in love,
watching TV, bad dreams, lone-
liness, children, responsibility,
and what is more, it's about
appreciating all that.

There is no finality tothis

‘ album, no secrets of life state-

ments. Double Fantasy. is both
ideologically and musically
modest. Neither Lennon or Ono
aspire for anything more than,a
passing statement of their
happiness. J

If Ono's songs have more bite
than Lennon's it's because she's
willing to see the darker side
inherent in any deep and trust-
ing relationship. I'm Moving On
and Give Me Something are curt,
wirey songs, while I'm Your
Angel and Beautiful Boys are lux-
uriously beautiful. Lennon on
the other hand has no ambivi-
lance. Beautiful Boy, Watching The
Wheels andDear Yoko have little if
any anger in them.

Maybe satisfaction isn't part
of rock and roll, so maybe this
isn't rock and roll, maybe it's
more. Perhaps the biggest and
best accomplishment is that it's
possible to listen to Double Fan-
tasy and for a moment forget
December 8, 1980. But only for
a moment.

BUMP IN THE NIGHT

Mercury _

I've always been a sucker for
the Faces. Throughout all their
sloppiness and drunken reputa-
tion théy had theirmoments of
absolute brilliance. Since the
band broke up, it's deposited
Rod Steward into vapidity, guit-
arist Ron Wood into the Stones‘,
and Kenny Jones into the Who.
Only keyboardist Ian McLagan
continues an eccentric solo

" path.

"Essentially what McLagan
has done is to recreate the Faces
sound without reforming the

s 5 band. Guitarist Johnny Lee
' Schell plays just like Ron Wood

(who contributes one song to

the LP) and the rest of the band

still plays that straight ahead

Bump In The Night is suggested
for those who lovingly

drinks. It's ideologically correct.

MAKING MOVIES
Dire Straits
Warner

"Making Movies Dire Straits
third album, is just what the
title implies—a brilliant package
of cinematic music that will
send vivid shives down the
send vivid shivers down the
music listeners.

Movies c'est la creme de la creme of

‘previous Straits albums. It

blends the fast-paced. imagery
of Dire Straitswith the seductive-
ness of Communique. In Making
Movies, Knopfler brings his
genius of lyrics and music to a
honed apex that culminates -in

' an irresistible album. .
The album is faster than the

previous two, but still contains
the intricate meshing of guitar,
bass, and drums that is the sole
trademark of the Straits. There

is also an added "wall of sound” V

effect that can be especially
noted with the sonic accentua-
tion of Pick Withers drum on

"Skateaway." Knopfler's char-I

acteristically nasal voice
delivers the final brush stroke
that paints a masterpiece.

Guest-starring on the album
is Roy Blittan of the E Street
Band who handles keyboards
exceptionally on several of the
cuts, the’ most noted being
”Tunnel Of Love.” One group
change that seems of little
importance is that Mark's
brother, David, has left the
group. .

The classic cuts seem to have

THE JEALOUS KIND
Delbert McClinton
Capitol

Delbert McClinton sounds
like Van Morrison without
brains. There's nothing wrong
with that--— brains get in the
way a lot of the time.

McClinton is happy just to
sing his honky tonk love songs
and leave the thinking up to
somebody else. The problem is
that there are too many people
around who do that, and they
and McClinton all start to blend
together.

The Jealous Kind, another pro-
duction from The Muscle
Shoals Rhythm Section (and
everyone in the business has
one) is as memorable as it is
forgettable. A I

McClinton serves up some

hot numbers. ”Giving It Up For A

Your Love” is a great song, as is
the title song, aslow bluesy bal-
lad. But these highlights are not
enough to sustain the whole
album. _ .

The rest of the songs just sort
of go ' through the motions.
Only "Take Me To The River"
(yea, everyone .in the business

has done that one) is an out and} ‘
out failure. The others are _

pleasing diversions that benefit
from McClinton's' fine voice,
but are hinyderedby the pristine
production of Barry'Beckett and
his crew. . —

”Giving It Up For Your Love"
proves how. good Delbert

McClinton can be, if only he'd._

TRUST '

Elvis Costello and The
Attractions ‘
Columbia

Has it ever occurred to you _
that in three and a half years,"

Elvis Costellohas managed” to

get out sixalbums of songs? Not _
five-cut wonders, but efforts _,
containing over a hundred.

. songs total.

This comes to mind because '

Costello's new record sounds
nothing so much as his ‘first.
That's inaccurate in a way, but
the feel is there; filtered
through three years of
experience. -

‘' For the first time in awhile, ' ‘
Costello gets down into good .

( I

old—fashioned rock n roll.-'

There's ”Lover's Walk” with its

4 Bo Diddley beat, a nifty little‘

reiteration of all the ways loyers
get "tangled up. There's ‘also

"Lexumburg" which is simply a
burn—down-the—house adre-
nalin number.”

Ballads are not neglected, as
"Shot With His Own Gun" is
the male answer to_"Alison",
and "Clubland" is the best piece
of pop rock Costello has come
up with since the Armed Forces
album.

Costello has commented that

_ he isn't going to be around for

his own "artistic decline.” You

wonder if he willever get to that ’

point. He certainly’ shows _no
sign of letting up. You can trust
in that.-

And the hits just- keep on
coming.
