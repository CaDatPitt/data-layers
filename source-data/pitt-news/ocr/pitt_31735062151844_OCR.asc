you have a fundamentalist taste in
poetry, you will be glad to hear that
all these lyrics, with the exception of
Miss St. Clair’s cinquain, are metri-
cal and rhymed. '

It is diﬁicult to deal out praise and
blame in reviewing a work like this
one. Yet I am tempted to venture
a few generalizations. For one thing,

these writers are writing; they have
brought forth into good black print
‘whatever was ‘jumping around inside
them clamoring for expression.

They did not-merely dream of writ-

ing, lapped in the delicious narcotic
sleepof “some day.” I repeat, they
wrote. And that is good, for if ever
our writers‘ are to_ write better, it will
be through the unremitting practice
of their art and through the encour-
a‘ge‘m_en_t of seeing their work printed,
when that is possible, in volumes like‘
theone at ._hand.

. , Pieces Interesting, Sincere

Two qualitiesin particular please
me about the collection. Almost
without exception, thelpieces are in-
teresting; and without any exception
at all, they are sincere. I put down

But shortcomings like these are in-
evitable in the work—-the early work,
at least-'—-of writers who have some-

last bit of it said. Better such than
dullness, sterility, lack of ﬁre and im-
agination, vexations which this year’s
Journeymanmercifully spares us. ~
In closing, I with-to choose two
'.‘ﬁrsts.” My preference in the
prose is Miss Brennan's “Cat Pa-.
g_oda,"- for its half-magical "mood of
scene; and among the poems, I am
taken most by ‘Edwin Banks’
“Dsphnis and Chloe,”-,whi'ch con-
veys a human reality with admir-
able restraint and technical skill.
I_ ‘mention these choices in the hope
that others will seek their own
preferences--or .at» least take . the
op‘portun"ity to impugn my sanity.
these pages with a picture of a group
of sensitive, intelligent individuals,:
each in his own way intensely inter-
ested inithe reality about him, con-.
cerned. with ﬁnding out its meaning
or its beauty or its truth, and willing

picture, and inonethe less so for the;
merit of the writing that evokes it.

Such defects as one ﬁnds are not
serious. Possibly some of the prose
is over-luxuriant, a little too gaily
festoned with adjectives; perhaps the
majority of the -stories and sketches
would. make a sharper impression
after some judicious pruning.

Now and ‘again, one -may suspect
that the poets have been led away
from the. strict path of their mean-
ing by the allurement of a seductive
rhyme. I - .. ‘

Norman

By John Mu-tinco

Higher education does little or
nothing to combat the “herd instinct,”
one of the basic psychologicalfactors
that niakes war possible.

This wat: the statenient of Ameri-
ca’s No. 1 socialist, Norman Thomas,
as he addressed a large group of Uni-
ve1‘:3it}' students Monday in Hotel
Schenley. -Approitimately 200 stu-
dents crowzled into the French Room
of the hotel to hear the talk.

Mr. Thomas declared that" the
“herd instinct” is becoming greater
all over the worldfand is especially
gaining ground in most of our col-
leges and universities. This, he said.
is the result of the attitude of stu-
dents and the homes they come from,

emphasizing the desire to “get
ahead.” '
Freedom Of Expression
Praising The Pitt News for its

‘stand taken in Monday’s editorial
-against cens.orship_.' Thomas declared
the foundation of any ilewspapcr de-
pends upon f1'eedo.m of expression.

The socialist: leader said that the
Worltl War -was a “lost opportunity”
as far as chances for a lasting peace
were concerned. Following the un-
fortunate Peace of Versailles, he
traced peace thought through what
he called “the crazy decade of the
twenties.” College students in this
period, he declared. did not care for
understanding. I‘?  this period, he
added, that geziamte-‘l dictators like
Hitler. .

“There is no basis for security,” he
continued, “but 9. different world.
Peace is not a;\;u_'o;)1'iate to a world
still organized under a capitalist na-
tionalistic system. The world is di-

Evelyn. "It takes a digestion in tiptop shape.

vided into the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-

nots’ with respect to both social

classes and nationalities.”

Thomas named two points which
he declared essential to winning
peace: (1) Development of a new
world-wide social order in the form
of a federation of cooperative com-
nionwealths with equality for nation-
alities and races; (2) Discovering
means in bringing this about to mini-
mize the danger of war.

Meantime, he said, care must be
taken at least to put the brakes on
capitalistic government.”

Asked what he thought of neu-
trality legislation, the perennial

presidential candidate said that he

favored mandatory neutrality legis-
lation with exceptions in policy made
by Congress rather than the Presi-
dent. However, he said that he
doubted whether such a neutrality
law would stand up for long under
pressure. '

Using recor-_d',s as a basis, ._Temple is
.a decided favorite. , They are leading
't_li'7’e[ l’eague":with only »_two defeats,
while" Wést‘Virginia' is cellared in the
Conference standing with only two
victories. But records also prove that

town ﬂo"o'r,'and.“a'nything” has dis-
tinctly a_ Mountaineer partiality. The
‘books prove that West"Virginiai is
hard to beat on its home floor, and
the physical atmosphere goes a long
way in deciding the Tresult of any
floor game. " ‘.
,.Then, another record-book fact that‘
evens things up comes" from the ﬁrst
meeting of these two-‘teams, held
"earlier in the year ‘at’ Philadelphia.

From this evidence it seems that
tonight’s contest, which holds the ulti-

should be a swell game. There are
a lot of Panthers who will be rooting
for a team tonight that they hope

‘The faculty does decide according to

When the vote was taken, the
amendment failed to get‘ even a ma-
jority of votes, two—thirds being nec-
essary.

that only-the president" be elected by
the Assembly, was defeated by a vote
‘of 12 to 11. ’

A_n‘o_ther defeated motion was. Wil-
liam. Stark’s proposal that dance
‘chairmen be removed from the execu-
tive committee of SFA. Defending
the_pro_posal, Stark pointed out that
entirely too much weight was being
given‘ to that relatviely minor func-
tlon of the executive committee, and
that this measure‘ would serve to set-
tle this question immediately at the
elections in thefspring.

The suggestion‘. was easily defeated
after William Brinker, assistant pro-
fessor of chemical engineering, said:
“We seem to ..be ‘progressing’ in re-
verse direction to the situation at the
University 15 years ago, when one
strongly organized school controlled
all campus politics and all class ofﬁ-
cers.”

A suggestion. by D. C. Schultz,
BA38, that a‘poll be ‘taken of stu-
dent opinion .to discover whether the
student body was in favor of a small
activitiesfee, to be used to aid such
insuﬂiciently ‘subsidized activities as
Pitt Players and debating, or as an
alternative, that they receive an in-
creased appropriation from the pres-
ent activities fund, was referred to

' AST‘ night a constitutional change of some
I merit.'was introduced from the = ﬂoor, in the"
Student-Faculty "Association's _ March meeting,
but most of theiboys and girls were not only
feeling “chippery’-’ but were also anxious‘ to‘ ad-
journ. The -News will attempt, ‘therefore,.'to
present the subject in a more serious and sensible
light to give the matter at least its just consid-
eration.

The proposed change involves the discontiniu-_

ance of the present appointment system to select
chairmen for the class dances, and the subsequent
adoption of a popular election system. _ ,_ _
From a distant point of view the signiﬁcance
of this change is open to question. During the
past‘ year,'peop1ewill tell you, dance chairmen,

extent that:

Election day in April, and all other student
elections and tappings, will be eliminated for-
ever, and in its place. a ballot box will be placed
in Room 801, Cathedral, and in Heinz House,
where the three sufficiently qualiﬁed people will
vote-concerning the election of all student offi-

"I had just ﬁnished a descriptive

I read it over

Presently, I subjected it to my
perpetual critic, asked him for his

calmly,-quietly, his face register-
ing nouexpression whatsoever. Then
he remarked, handing ‘my Mss._
back: "So what."

“So wliat.'."’ I queried. “What do
you mean ‘So what?’ I merely handed
you this paper for criticism, asked
you for your opinion, urged you to
make some critical.jud‘gnient. Have
you nothing more to say?”

“Nothing more. Just ‘So what?’ ”

“But you must explain," I de-
manded. “Please, just something
more than '50 what?’ ”

“You are angry,” he explained.

“You want me to say more, to pre- ‘

But when I asked so what? you must
try to tell me the ‘wl1at’—the sig-

script.” ’ ’ 

“The meanintt? Why don't you
see what I'm -trying to do?” I‘
questioned.‘ “I'm trying to present‘
a description --—- that and nothing
more. I have inr.lude,d good, ‘even
rich, details -- you «intimate that
yourself. Heavens, man, what do
you want?" - _

“Just signiﬁcance—--that’s all,” my
critic responded.

good picture? Doesn’t it strike your
fancy? Isn't it of somevalue?”

“Let me answer your questions
in order," my critic offered. “As
for your first, I would say that as a
picture it is fairly good. But it is
a rather obvious example of word
painting: a brook, a. bird, h butter-
fly,a.nd a. cow. And then some flow-
ers and grass colored with adjec-
tives. It is a picture, yes.

_ , "But no, it ‘does not strike my
fancy. You see .1 have read practi-
cally hundreds of these pictures: pic-
tures of rain and snow and sun, pic-
tures of birds and rabbits and pet
dogs, and even meadows. If what
you call my fancy is my ability to be

satisﬁed by any particular piece of

writing, I should not say that your
description strikes anything. Unless
it strikes me that it is rather mean-
ingless. ’ .
“Your third question—-‘isn"'t it
of some value’--—I should say that:
it is--potentially. In a several hun-_
dred page novel, yoil might include
it to offer ﬂavor and setting. Alone,

it has no value. It may help to
train you to write clearly by giv-
, ing you practice in setting down‘
what yousee in writing, but if the
result is that you are satisﬁed by
such- writing per se, your writing
Will never be ‘significant. Person-
ally,TI feel that each writer, amn-
teur or professional, likes to think
that his work means something to

this; SFA -should enact legislation to provide
for-the popular selection of the men who are to

The ‘selection would . tal<'e'.placet5at" the ‘regular
spring elections and would not add a great~deal
more work to the present election set-up. «ach

regardless of school, would be eligible to vote
under the proposed amendment. The freshmen

_ officers could be elected at a special election

some time in the early Fall._ _
This change would do mor-ethan to discourage

if the assembly candidate who seeks election merely
: to"take’a part 'in‘tli'e se'le"'c.tion7 of a dance chair-
man.

It would do more than ridding SFA of
this political step-child,'and.«a1low time for the

' consideration and enactment of more important
- legislation.‘ It, takes no gseatleader to chairman

spite of thechairman in charge. Under the pro-

result. of ‘the change, 'there.might 'he..a diff erence

between Junior Prom and Senior Ball. A posi-

tive ‘class ‘consciousness,’ socially, is likely to be

. realized. When graduation comes around, there
will be, normally, a sizeable surplus that might
well be used to buy the class memorials, and
thus replace the present system of re_t.u1;‘I,1ing four
dollars and two half-dollars to each senior for
his or her ﬁve dollar deposit on the graduation
cap and gown, followed by asking each senior
to contribute “a half dollar or more” from an
already tightly-pinched pocketbook for “a living
memorial to the Cathedral.” The living memo-
rials are ﬁne, but they should not be collected
by passing the hat up and down the graduation
line. The expense should be made" up, propor-
tionatel.-y gvpr the.-’four year period. “Splits of
the spoils, plums, ’ and “revolving” dance chair-
men would not even be mentioned in SFA cham-
b_ers under the new system.‘ Much time and fric-
tion would be saved in disposing of this rela-
tively unimportant issue- Sophomores are com-
petent and should ..th_e1-efore ..be permitted, to
select their own class chairman, and similarly for
the other classes. _Good, healthy disagreement

ONE of the reputed effects of the Depression was that
it induced the great mass of the population to de-

 

 

vote a part" of their attention to social and intellectual‘

Acc‘oi'ding‘ to the thesis advanced, the eco-
brought the people to a sense of the reali-
ties of life, made them realize that there were such
things in the _.world as."‘ideas” and that it was to_theJi'
interest to know about them and, at least, to. discuss

probler__ns.

FREQUENTLY, the increased circulation of books_a't

the public libraries was pointed to as an indication
of the new trend; the lecture .pl.at;£o1-ni, deserted by
itinerant English novelists and foreign culture-briI.1g_ei's,
was employed as a forum of advanced public opinion.
and great numbers of open-eared common folk attended
And because the incidence of the crisis was so complete,
and its effects so startling, it was assiiuiied that the great
mass of the common people had no other choice but to
think. ,. ' " -

Actually, of co.i.ii'se, tl-:.r.- population was doing no
more thinking than it liud done before 1929.

The qiiestionings that one liearcl on all sides were
raised by individuals who had either always questioned

. O

the tenets of the existing system or-who, because of I

their altered position in the crisis, had no other choice
than to question. From the great mass of the popula-
tion there came only the muffled roar of great inchoate
discontent, and the leaders were the ones who whipped
these emotional urges into concrete demands and semi-
logical programs. The masses neither criticized nor
debated“tl‘ie programs in any realistic fashion; they

' merely followed. The leaders furnished the intellectual

framework for the tide of unrelated, ._unoi'ganize-d emo-
tion for relief and refoi*m———indeed, sometimes almost
of revolution itself——that whirled dervish-like across the
U. S. during the dark years of‘1931-33. They, the
leaders, and not the people as a whole were the voice
of the people. : - .

Vox Populi . .

THE harbingers of reform rode on the wave of dis-
content but. now that the Depression has lifted they
ﬁnd themselves losing out; the sovereign people, now
that their incomes have risen, want little or no tamper-
ing with the system; they want to be let alone so that
they can react -with the necessary enthusiasm to what-
ever new fancy comes along. -They do not want to be
tired out by intellectualism. . ’
It is hard tobelieve that had there been any real
tl'_iin_kin.g on the part of the “people” tliatit would have
dissipated so quickly. But today, except for those
workers who are offered substantial advantages——such
as increases in wages,_shorter working hours, etc.-—from
the reforming_ activities of unions, the population has
littleiriterest in anything -except the earthy,'day-to-day
activities which have always claimed .their atteiition.

.Dl1I‘l1'lg‘ the Depression it was because they were suf-

ficiently aggravated by :the economic crisis that the
people espoused any opinion; and then that opinion was
held aloft as though it had proceeded entirely from
themselves. A

By and large, however, the “people” do not have to
“think things out.” The theme song of Democracy is
that the “Voice of the People is the Voice of God.”
‘_When you can just ra’r back and declare that something
is thus-and-so from a sort of divine intuition, what need
is there to think the problem out?
