TOMS
Shoes to

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt students want to help get shoes
for children in developing countries,
like Guatemala, Argentina and Ethio-
pia, through a company called TOMS
Shoes. . V 4
. For each pair of shoes the TOMS
company sells, it gives a pair away
to a child in a developing nation.
The company has given away more
than a million shoes and reached out
through thousands of college students
across the country.
Pitt’s group is one of the 1,800

' United States college and high school

campus clubs representing the com-
pany’s mission, said Nori Powojski,

City councilman addresses studentconstituents

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staff Writer

City Councilman Bruce Kraus spoke to
a group of students in the William Pitt
Union to try to get to know his Oakland
constituents better. But ﬁrst, he wanted to
know what students thought of him.
“Anybody have a bad opinion of me?

-I’m dead serious,” he said.

really think of students,” he said.

Kraus said it’s true that his image is
much more associated with the South
Side than Oakland because it’s a bigger
and sexier area. He represents many Pitt
students in District Three, which includes
most of South and Central Oakland.

Through the question-and-answer ses-
sion, Kraus, who is up for re-election this
fall, laid out issues he’s addressed as a
councilman. It is the second such visit
Kraus made to Pitt’s campus this year. His
first was a similar session before awatch

in January; r ‘ A . V
Kraus said he’s known to be strict when
it comes to policy on alcohol consumption

and nightlife. But as someone who was

party for_the State of the Union Address

once college—aged, he said nightlife is an _

important part of the college experience
and maintaining a safe and lively evening
scene in Pittsburgh is one of his goals.
“[Students] deserve to enjoy nightlife
in a safe environment that’s well policed
and welllit,” he said. .
As Pittsburgh’s library system .has

faced economic strain’ over the past few
years, Kraus said he’s working to ensure
the continued functioning of the Carnegie

V Library in Oakland,’]bu;t the ‘City; Council

has found itdifficult to coordinate” with
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and his adminis-
tration on this issue. '

Mike Waalkes, a member of Pitt Demo-
crats, was glad for any effort to save the
Carnegie library system.

egie library. There’s so many budget cuts

club coordinatorforTOMS Shoes. The
company itselfbegan with one man,
not named Tom, but Blake Mycoskie,
an entrepreneur from Texas. The
name TOMS Shoes actually stands for
Tomorrow’s Future, Powojski said.
The club’s leaders said they hope
-to promote TOMS Shoes’ mission

' through events on campus. Lauren

Miller, the club’s vice president, said
one of its biggest events this yearwill
be Style Your Sole on March 24. Stu-
dents can bring their TOMS and the
club will have canvas, sharpies and
acrylic paint available, ready for per-
sonal decorations on the shoes.
TOMS Shoes also sponsors the
One Day Without Shoes, which takes
place on Aprils. For24 hours, partici-
pants don’twear any kind of footwear
to raise awareness for poor children
in developing countries, accordingto
the company’s website. According to
the site, more than 250,000 people,
participated in the event last year.

I “The purpose is to be reallyvisible
and have people ask why we are walk-
ing without shoes on and tell them

outthe problem that exists,” Miller

said.

The shoes cost between $40 and '

$100 a pair from TOMS Shoes’ web~
site. Most are slip—ons or low—rise,

A laced shoes and made from burlap,

corduroy or canvas.

Graduate School of Public and In-
ternational Affairs professor Kevin
Kearns said the company is an exam-
ple of a movement in philanthropy
called social enterprise, in which the
ideais to establish a business that_has
business goals but also accomplishes a
social good or beneﬁtfor society.

TOMS Shoes also can provide a
“sustainable” source of assistance
to people in need without having to
rely on government funding, philan-

thropic ﬁmding or corporate grants,

he said.

Kearns said thatthis means TOMS
doesn’t need to be constantly asking
other parties for money to support
its cause. Another beneﬁtwith TOMS
Shoes is that the company builds pub-
lic awareness of the need for shoes in
the developing world while creating a
network of support through customer
loyalty-

“People get sort ofhooked on buy-
ing their shoes there, and then they

Coach: Player will not return to

frombeingsumned.

Court records showthat Diaz, originallyﬁnm
Bronx, N.Y., was also chargedwith public drunken-

‘ ness and obstruction ofhighways.

Diaz did not immediately respond to requests
for comment and court records did not list an

. attorney for him.

Ata news conference yesterday, Todd Graham,
who became head football coach injanuary, said
Diaz will not retnm to the team, though he had
been tryingto before the incident.

“Unfortunately, he madea mistake and there’s
going to be accountability there, and that’s why
he’s not in our program anymore,” Graham said.
‘The thingwith me is thatyou hurt for the kid 
that’s something that’s very diiﬁcult as a coach to
make those kind of decisions.”

Diaz was charged by court summons, and his
next hearing is scheduled for April 11.

might get engaged in other ways, perhaps by
volunteering, or by making additional charitable
donations,” Kearns said. ‘

There are about 50 students who come to
regular meetings and 130 on the mailing list for
TOMS Shoes of Pittsburgh, Miller said. The club

has shown documentary screenings and created '

committees to plan events.

The club’s leaders — president Natalie Val-
entino, Miller and business manager Rebecca
Sherman —— are sophomores who say they wear
TOMS Shoes.

“A couple of years ago, I saw a commercial
on TV, and then bought my ﬁrst pair last year,”
Valentino said. “AfterI spoke about the company
for class, I tl1ought, ‘We have to do something
about this.”’

The company began asan idea that occurred
to Mycoskie ﬁve years ago. When traveling in
Argenﬁnain 2006, Mycoskie noticed many chil-
dren had no shoes. He decided to help these
children by creating a company that would give
a pair of new shoes to a child in need with each
pair of shoes purchased — part of the One for
One Movement.

GSPIA associate professor Paul Nelson said
TOMS Shoes has more justamarketing gim-
mick, it’s a company that does arespectable job
reaching out those who need shoes. But people‘ in
need might rather have money than shoes.

, “You may need to realize thatapair of shoes

Shoes go to needy children

next day for sale to buy food, vegetable oil or
medical supplies E—' which is a smart choice on
their part,”EN'elson said. T

Nelson said students should continue their ,

awareness and look on websites such as Oxfam,

1 Bread for the World and Amnesty International

among others, after they buy a pair of TOMS
Shoes. -

Both Nelson and Kearns stressed the un-
portance of being careful to avoid damaging
local shoe industries. Nelson said that when a
surplus is given to a population, local industries
would have to compete with the lesser priced or
free products.

“There are shoe industries in Africa such as
N igeria, Kenya and South Africa and we need
to be make sure there is no indirect effect of un-
dercutting small shoe industries,” Nelson said.

The company website says one of its guiding
principles in giving away shoes is “Do no Harm,”
in which TOMS Shoes will “workwith their part-
ners to ensure that the children receiving our
shoes truly could not afford to purchase them
on their own, to minimize the negative impact
on the local shoe—selling economy.”

‘ By last September, the most recent statis-
tics, the TOMS Shoes company gave away more
than one million pairs of shoes, according to
its website.

“We hope to raise awareness fortheir move-
ment and cause,” Sherman said. “And this is a

- given to someone might be on the market the

   

, unique route to help people.” I

night in room 540 of the William Pitt Union during a question—and—answer session.

the institution,” Waalkes said.

Members of Pitt Democrats also asked
about the ailing pension system the city
faces.

The city managed to avoid a state take-
over of its pension fund by a few hours.
But if the state had taken over, the result
might not have been too bad, given the
state’s record of managing pension funds
compared to the city’s.

“Given our record and the state’s  it’s

kind of a no—brainer,” he said.

Kraus also distanced himself from the
proposed Fair Share Tax, a 1—percent tax
on tuition for Pittsburgh’s college students
that was introduced in 2009 but not en-
acted. He said there was a gap in under-
standing about students’ feelings when
the tax was proposed. But the vehement
student response made their opinions
clear, he said.

“The stupidest thing you can do as an

elected official is assume you know what
people are thinking,” he said.

The councilman also spoke about his
history. When he first ran for election, he
directly addressed his personal life.

“I’m gonna go out there and say, ‘Hello,
I’m Bruce Kraus and I’m a homosexual and
alcoholic. Will you vote for me?”’

But Kraus didn’t think of deﬁning him~
self as the first openly gay public official
in Pittsburgh. He was a public official who
happened to be gay. He also said he’s been
sober for more than 22 years.

Kraus is seeking re—election and he
could have to form relationships with
new City Council members, depending
on the results. A petition to put his name
on the Democratic ballot was on a table
in the room.

“When you’re in the business that I’m
in, every relationship is the most impor-
tant one,” he said. I

Deeper into the
mud of shame

e won! After delivering
Wa disappointing season
fraught with on-the-

ﬁeld missteps and administrative
peccadilloes, Pitt’s football team
has ﬁnally proven victorious.

But wait —— don’t start high-
ﬁving or popping champagnes.

Apparently, the Panthers are
better than everyone else — at
getting arrested. Yesterday, Sports
Illustrated published the results of
an investigation that found that
the Panthers had more football
players bearing criminal records
than any other team in the SI 2010
preseason Top 25.

The six—month investigation
was conducted by Sports Illustrat-
ed and CBS News, and it involved
scouring records of all 2,837
players in the preseason rosters
of those 25 teams. According to
Sports Illustrated, 2010 Pitt foot-
ball players represented more than
10 percent of all players found to
have been charged or cited with
a crime — 22 Pitt athletes out of
204 total. .

With no school-by-school de-
tails as to the nature of the charg-
es, the number of convictions or
their trend over time, the SI article
is clearly limited and should not
spark overreaction. But for Pitt
to sit conﬁdently at the top of the
list — the next runner up has four
fewer players charged — is a dis-
grace.

True, many of the high-proﬁle
cases that account for Pitt’s SI
ranking— stories involvingjabaal
Sheard,Jason Douglas andjeffrey
Knox — have already had their day
in the news cycle. But now with
the SI publication receiving na-
tional attention, the football team
has yet again accomplished one
more tug on the incessant drag
of Pitt’s name through the mud
of ignominy. Somehow, some way,
this self-provoked shaming must
stop.

One proposed solution, as the
SI article suggests, is criminal
background checks during re-
cruiting. According to the article,
ever since Knox was arrested and
booted from the team, the Athletic

Department has changed its re-
cruiting practices, but background
checks are still not pursued.

Instead, the University state-
ment published in the article
says the change is a “checklist of
questions that attempts to gain
greater knowledge of the behavior
and citizenship of an individual
prospect.”

In a news conference yester-
day, Athletic Director Steve Ped-
erson called this milder diagnostic
“background research,” and he
insisted that it was integrated
before the Athletic Department
knew a media investigation was
in the works.

Whether or not this “back—
ground research” will adequately
substitute for actual background
checks remains to be seen. But we
agree that Pitt recruiters should
expend more energy reaching into
incoming athletes’ pasts, at least
for football candidates. With a
professional stadium and several
nationally televised games, the
football team carries the Pitt em-
blem like few others. Considering
that and Panther football’s recent
history of high-proﬁle criminal
charges, a background check pi-
lot would ﬁttingly start with the
football team.

No one’s calling background
checks the silver bullet or instruct-
ing recruiters to disqualifyvanyone
with misdemeanors. Background
checks represent only one useful
tool for the Athletic Department
to use as it makes sure ~ we hope
— that the embarrassing 2010
season never repeats itself. But a
solution we think would be more
effective is changing the culture
now abounding in Pitt football.
By next year, every player should
appreciate his role as a leader in
the campus community, and he
should realize the magnitude of
damage he can inﬂict with even
one slip—up.

When Todd Graham accepted
the job of head coach in Janu-
ary, he talked of bringing to the
football program “integrity.” So
Coach, you clearly have a lot of
work ahead of you. 3;’: '

UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

Auf wiedersehen to
Unconventional Wisdom

 
   

Jacob Brown
Columnist

I could write a really poetic column
with words that waft through the at-
mosphere, or diction that could soar
above our imaginations in some kind
of elaborate poetry. But I’m not going
to. There’s no need.

Because what I really mean to say
withoutallof the ﬂuff is that afterwrit—
ingforthis newspaper since 2oo6,this
will be the last column of my college
career -— even with two months left
of school. Yes, really.

Now with 4,352 characters left to
makethe most ofmy exit, I’rn supposed
to share something that will change
your lives, some kind of inspiration
that you’ll remember years from now.
Iwas originallyplanning onwritingthis
column about following your passion
and not being afraid to ﬁght for what
you believe in.

Then I looked at the last column
I wrote in high school and realized it
was basically about the same thing. So
I scrapped that idea. .

Then I thought I’d jump on some
vitriolic tangent about how Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg is an absentee
landlord — someone put in the sole
position of makingour college degrees
cost more tomorrow than they do to-
day. Indeed, when I enrolled at Pitt in
2006, we were ranked 58th inthe na-
tion, according to US News 8: World
Report.

Today, 01? Nordy has done a stellar
job, raisingtnitionrates consistently, al-
lowingPittto overpopulateto the point
where students are living in hotels in-
stead of becoming more selective and
leuing our rank slip to 64th.

Forthat kind of progress, it sounds
like he deserves his six-ﬁgure paycheck
about as much as Michael Vick would
deserve to beaguestjudge atthe West-
minster Dog Show. But Fve been com-

plaining about his reclusiveness and

hypocrisy for years to no avail, so it’d
be awaste of time to continue that any
ﬁirther.

So ifI’m not goingto lecture y’all on
vim,vigor andwhy Nordy shouldmake
like me and resignwhile the going’s still
good, Iﬁgure I should change the pace
to what I’ve learned over the past ﬁve
years in college.

This year, Ibegan compilingarun-
ninglistof philosophies and teachings
that college has provided me. With the
last 2,712 characters I have left in this
career, I’m goingto share afewofthem
with you — all of which are open to
interpretation beyond the literal con-
text.

Perhaps the ﬁrst thing I learned in
college —— besides never to play beer
pongwithrumand Coke—was asirn-
ple one: Ifagirl——orwhatever sexrows
your gears — asks you to dance, the
answer is always an immediate “yes.”
No questions asked. .

Young professionals find jobs on dance ﬂoor

Sierra Starks
Senior Staff Writer

First Fridays

This Friday and every ﬁrst Fri-
day of the months to follow

9 p.m. to 2 a.m. (Most start at
7 p.m.) ‘

980 Liberty Ave.
ﬁrstfridayspitt.com

While listening to a DJ’s music and
shuffling around the dance ﬂoor,
some 20—somethings have found
the connections they needed to
land jobs.

Xavier Hairston-Khan, a recent
CMU graduate, compared the First
Fridays events at the August Wil-
son Center for African American
Culture to a college party with
older and more mature attendees.
The nationally recognized parties,
which are held each month, are
meant to help young black profes-
sionals ﬁnd jobs within the city,
though anyone is allowed to at-
tend.

Hairston-Khan, who now
works for Turner Construction
as a ﬁeld engineer, said that with
this crowd he was able to network
and learn more about local profes-
sional organizations. e

“What I appreciated most about
First Fridays was the fact that I was
surrounded by a positive group of
people of color,” Hairston—Khan
said. “There were people like ‘me,
young and professional, who had
similar aspirations and were work-
ing to achieve them ... Just being
surrounded by those people was
welcoming. Having fun with them
was an added bonus.”

The events are organized by’

Justin Nwokeji, founder and execu-
tive director of Savvy Marketing.
Savvy Marketing is a marketing,
entertainment, event planning and
promotions group. It’s dedicated
to creating events and using vari-
ous industries to improve oppor-
tunities for urban residents.

The winner will open for B.o.B. on March 26

Jonathan Shakesprere
For The Pitt News

Before the chart—topping rap-
per B.o.B. takes the stage in the
Fitzgerald Field House on March
26, at least one of Pitt’s student
musicians will take the stage,
performing for 3,000 of their
peers.

The Pitt Program Council, in
conjunction with WPTS, will host
21 Hip-Hop Battle in Nordy’s Place
at 10 p.m. today to decide who
will be the opening act for B.o.B.’s
first performance in Pittsburgh.
Representatives from the two
campus organizations expect a

good turnout.

“The Hip-Hop Battle is differ-
ent from the traditional cypher
setup of only individual perfor-
mances, so the title reﬂects the
spirit of the event and a desire
to continue the_tradition of last
year,” said Pokuaa Owusu, head
of promotions for WPTS.

Only the first 10 groups who
signed up are able to perform,
and each receives 10 minutes to
showcase its ability. Judges will
then rank each act on a scale of
one to 10, incorporating crowd
response to ﬁnalize their scores

and determine the winner with

the highest added score. I

In a culture where top—10 songs on the
radio typically consist of computer-
generated beats and melodies, Solas
offers a refreshing twist to the mo-

notony, with an array of instruments
that create a rich folk sound.

With just weeks until St. Pan'ick’s
Day, Irishfolkband Solas has released
its newalbum, The Turning Tide, after
14 years as a band. The group follows
its 2008 albumForLove andLaughter
witl1 the new release.

The band uses nine different in-
struments andafemale vocalist on its
albums, providing the audience with
a traditional Irish sound. But Solas

I puts a modern twist on their music,

producing an album that could easily
transcend the playlists of more con-
temporary listeners.

Many tracks on both For Love
and Laughter and The Turning Tide
emulate the traditionallrishgenrethat
Solas promotes, but there are clear
hints toward other more mainstream

genres, like country and jazz.
“Hugo’s Big Reel,” the opening
track on The Tuming Tide, starts the
albumwithaninstrumentalpiecethat
effectively demonstrates Solas’ diverse
use of instruments through a more
traditional piece of Irish folk music.
Other tracks, such as “The Crows of
Killimer/Box Reel #2/Boys of Malin/

The Reel House,” also portray the ,

genre strongly.

The Ttlrning Tide continues with
“GirlintheWar,”abeautiﬁ1lballadthat
emulates Solas’ contemporaryfusions
and sounds similar to some popular
country songs.

calist, asserts her presence without
overpowering the rest of the band and

Formostpeople, acarisassociatedwith
travel and little else. Colin Noonan, how-
ever, had a different mentality when
creating the 12 paintings in his “Idle”
exhibit: The automobile became a pri-
vate space, wherein’the driver and the
vehicle both sit still, doing nothing.

“Idle” features pieces‘ that merge
two classic genres of att— oil paintings
and portraits —-todepictpeople stalled
intheir cars. The exhibit, which repre-
sentsa change inthe artist’s work, will
open Friday and remain open through
April 3.

For Noonan, focusing on portraits
was a switch from landscape paint-
ings.

“Makingst1'lls become suchacaged

way ofworkingthatpeople lumped me
into acategorythatwasn’t satisfactory,”
Noonan said about prior pieces and
exhibits. “People wantedtoputme into
aclassical sort of mode. My newworkis
an attempt not to divorce myselffrom
the classical model butto update it and
keep the fashion of the day.”

Retuming to Pittsburgh in 2003
after studying art in New York, Noo-
nan felt burned out after dealing with
“astressﬁiltimeinmy life.”With school
over, he felttheurgetoworkand founda
job asamechanic atthe German Motor
Werks Garage.

“I was interested in the art of me-
chanics because it’s similar to art,”
Noonan said. “It’s something you can
learn.” ' ' - ’

Noonan’s interest in art never
completely disappeared, and the art-

ist now uses a corner of the garage as-

his studio. He occasionally helps with
maintenance, but for the most part,
he “tries to be a ghost and work in the

. space nextto the workers.”

To help with his “Idle” portraits,
Noonan asked people to model for

him, including Eva Mueller, a junioriat
Chatham University studying interior
architecture. She’d previously stud-
ied photography and knew Noonan
through networking with Pittsburgh’s
artistic community.

“He had talked to me about what
his artwas aboutand hewas tryingto
emulate the stilllife portraits ofpeople,”
Mueller said. “He wanted them to be

reﬂective ofa mystery. Ifyouarelooking -

atan oil paintingand you see a portrait
of somebody, ittells astory. Ithinkthat’s
what hewas tryingto do. And I’ve had
some experiencewithphotographyand
thatwas how he started his process.”

came into the shop four or ﬁve times
during the process to help Noonan
capture just what he wanted.

sessions just to get that image in his

MOVIE COLUMN

Many movies favor

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

  

In caseyou hadn’t noticed, ﬁlm executives believe
theyﬁnally knowthe secretto makingasuccessful
movie: Shun original ideas at all cost. ‘

. It’s become almost passe to bemoan Holly-
wood’s obsessioriwith makingaproﬁt, but colum-
nist Mark Harris still manages to make the issue
seem incendiary. With snide assurance, theformer
Entertainment Weekly executive editor outlines
in February’s GQ the myriad interrelated reasons
why originality has been almost entirely eclipsed
bymarketingsensibilities — aprocess he doesn’t
hesitate to proclaim the “death” of movies.

Harrishasalonglistofculprits he blames for i

rvenue over creativity  

Harris enumerates this year’s movie roster; which
includes f‘fouradaptations of comic books,” “one
sequel to a sequelto a sequel to a movie based
on an amusement—park ride,” “one prequel to a
remake,” “two sequels with a 5 in the title” and .
“one sequelthat, iﬁtwere inclinedto use numbers,
would haveto have a71/2 inthe title [‘I-Iarry Potter
and the Deathly HallowsPt.2’].’’ ’

Indeed, a cursory comparison of thegtop 10
highest—grossing ﬁlms of 1973 and the top 10 ’
highest—grossing ﬁlms of 2010 underscores the
sheer unoriginality of our cinematic landscape:
In the former list original features, including
“American Graffiti” and “Last Tango _in Paris,”
areprevalent; inthe latter onlytwo ﬁlms, “Incep—
tion” and “Despicable Me,” aren’t taken from
existing stories. I

do studios busy themselves with the almost
negligible chore of brainstorming its

execution.

movie marketing whizzes to the makers of “Top
Gun.” Even ordinary audiences aren’t spared -
we’re simply too preoccupied with private stream-
ing devices, he said, to invest the time and money.
into the localmultiplex.

There’s a lot in Harris’ column worth engag-
ing — I encourage everyone to read it — but I’d
like to focus my attention on ‘the point I found
most arresting: the ideathat Hollywoodﬁhns are
evaluatedﬁrstand foremost on the basis of sales
potential. Only once a movie’s bankability is as—‘
sureddo studios busythernselves withthe almost
negligible chore of brainstorming its execution.

This would at least partially explain the pre-
dominance of franchises at the multiplex -
squalid recyclings of previous and likely more

proliferation of these ﬁlms is that they’re exten—
sions of already—existing_“brands,” and there-
fore make for safer investments than original
features. “Harry Potter,”forinstance,was already
a best—selling novel before it hit theaters; “Scott
Pilgrim”was apopular comic book. Sequels, too,
are brands, as are remakes. Original features on
the other hand — movies like “Inception” or
' ‘Avatar” — are treated as anomalies when they

 do succeed and afﬁrmations of model when

they don’t.
Lest you think this mentality is exaggerated,

commendable efforts. The rationale guiding the ~

Given the current obsession with brands,
it’s easy to imagine a sort of cinematic dystopia
wherein every “n ’ ﬁlm is a spin-off, sequel or

A remake of some previous work. The entertain— ‘
mentlandscape begins to abide byalawofdimin—
ishingretnrns ——the originality ofﬁlms approach-
ingbut never quite equaling zero. Eventually, the
industry’s bank of reusable material becomes
exhausted; sometime perhaps after “Saw 178.”

To avert this nightmare scenario, if we’re not
already in the midst of it,’ I’d like to advocate a
boycott of sorts: From here on out, any movie
that is in some ways an extension of an existing
brand, including comic book movies, sequels and
remakes, should be shunned until it hits Netﬂix.
Conversely every original feature, especially if
it’s onewith the backing of major studios, should ’
merit our theater attendance. Whether any of
these movies are any good should be of no object
— the fate of the cinema is at stake.

Of course my initiative is_unlikelyto ﬁnd much
support among moviegoers, particularly those

eagerlyanticipatingti1e‘newBatmaninstallment "V

or the ﬁnal chapter of the “Harry Potter” series.
Nevertheless, it makesforaninteresting exercise
to envision the consequences of this collective
shunning. After all, ifthere’s anywayto eradicate
what seems to be an increasingly entrenched
mentality, it’s this ,— Hollywood executives, after
all, are notorious for only trusting the money. I

After discovering some of Noonan’s landscapes
on display at a cafe, she researched the artist and
beganto talkwithhim about doinga show.

Sweterlitsch said shewas intriguedby Noonan’s
current comparisons between the human body
and the car as a machine.

Eva Mueller:

Intheexhibitthere’s“acarbeingstalledaswell ‘

[as the people], in a way,” Sweterlitsch said. “It’s
a meditative moment and still moment, which
is interesting because these are oil paintings.
They’re layer upon layer and take time to work
on and require you to slow down and look at the
contemporary subjects in this quiet meditative
way.You’llwonderwhattl1e;frethir1kir1gornoﬁce
more about the shadows across their faces. It’s
really ﬁlled with stillness. It really does match a
car being idle as well.”

i Noonan’s artbrings somethingnewto the gal-
lery, Sweterlimch said. 

“They’re images based inthe garage aswellas \

people on carsand peopleas individuals,” she said.
“It’s very ﬁgurative which is different from what
we’ve shown recently. And traditional oil paintings
aredifferent, too.” ~

i Mueller said shewas impressedwiththe results
of Noonan’s latest endeavor.

“I think they look almost scary for how real
they are,” she said “I didn’t expect them to turn

ing the venue of the event from the Shadow
Lounge to the August Wilson Center for
African American Culture, located in Pitts-

burgh’s Cultural District. With this change ,

in venue, Nwokejihopes to compete with

— other cities around the nation.

When he came to Pittsburgh from Wash-
ington, D.C., in 2007, Nwokeji noticed there
weren’t a lot of social events for young black
professionals in Pittsburgh. He felt there
was a void that needed to be ﬁlled.

Justin Nwokeji:

“We wanted these young professionals
to have a place to go not only to just en-

joy themselves but also to" network with
like—minded individuals,” he said. So he

revamped the The Reel House First Fridays
event.

This year, attendees can expect to par-
ticipate in an art gallery crawl hosted by the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. For the ﬁrst part
of the night, usually beginning at 7 p.m.,
they can enjoy a networking happy hour that
begins with a live jazz band —— this month
the Live City Jazz Band is featured — hors
d’oeuvres and a chance, to interact with the

‘ corporate sponsor of the month, although

there is no corporate sponsor this month.
In a change, this month’s event will begin
at 9 p.m. '
_]anuary’s corporate sponsor was High-
mark, a Pittsburgh—based company that
manages Blue Cross and Blue Shield health

insurance. Nwokeji thought it was important ‘

to include networking with a local corpora-
tion in the night’s agenda because he want-
ed to enlighten young black professionals

about the job opportunities available for ’
them in Pittsburgh. A
Though many universities are present in

the area, Nwokeji believes that “Pittsburgh
doesn’t keep the young professionals or
students who gettheir education here past
graduation.” Heattributed this lack of re-
tention to the students’ lack of knowledge
of the companies that are looking to hire
minorities in the area.

Alecia Shipman, cultivation associate
for the center, found herself in exactly that
position years’ ago when ﬁrst pursuing her
undergraduate degree in New York. She,
like many of her friends, left Pittsburgh to
ﬁnd a more suitable environment.

When Shipman returned to Pittsburgh
to begin her graduate studies at Carnegie
Mellon University, she thought the pick-
ings were slim. ,

Sometime between the hours of 9 and
10 p.m. on a First Friday evening, the DJ
proceeds to play a mixture of hip-hop, R&B
and soul music and the atmosphere becomes
more_party—like, Nwokeji said. I

Yet it’s evident to Shipman that the focus
is never taken away from the exchange and
cultivation of culture. ‘

“There were a few times that I would
leave out of the dance area and see people
actually looking at the artwork on the walls,”
she said. “First Fridays is a prime opportu-
nity for people not only to enjoy our space
[at the center] and the nightlife atmosphere,
but to also embrace the arts.”

Shipman, like Nwokej i, hopes that Pitts-
burgh can begin to do some embracing of
its own.

“A lot of recent graduates leave because
they can’t ﬁnd what they need here,” Ship-
man said. “They don’t feel like Pittsburgh
is for them.” '

“It’s obviously an issue,” she continued.
“But it’s most obvious when you see students

who have graduated from Pitt, CMU or other ‘

universities in the area, and they immedi-
ately apply for jobs elsewhere.” ,,

going on — the school added
more in—depth procedures for evalu-
ating players before they arrived on

campus. He added that the process A

is still dependent on coaches going to
the schools and cities to learn what

: they can about the recruit.

“The hardest part in all that is
that it’s very hard to predict human
behavior,” he said. “Sometimes,
people make mistakes. We’re doing
the best we can while they’re here
to help them grow into the kind of
people that we know they want to be
and what we want for them.”

Pederson said that conducting
actual background checks is a con_-
versation that would have to take
place on the national level between
conference commissioners and ath-
letic directors.

“I think anytime you can do that
and it would be fair and equitable to
everybody, including the student ath-
letes involved, we would certainly be
in favor of having that discussion.”

The joint Sports Illustrated and
CBS News investigation consisted
of running background checks on
all 2,837 players on the 25 preseason

rosters. Of the 25 schools, only two I

conduct background checks inde-
pendently and none of the schools
looked at juvenile records.

According to the article, investi-
gators used 31 courthouses, 25 law
enforcement agencies and 17 states
to check players’ names, dates of
birth and other information. They
also used online databases to ﬁnd
criminal records. Seven percent of
the 2,837 players had criminal re-
cords.

Pederson said it’s been an un-
usual year for the football team, as
the Panthers experienced a number
of high-proﬁle incidents in a short
amount of time. Within a period of
about three months this summer,
four Pitt players were arrested for
violent crimes.

“I think this is very atypical of
the football program and the Atl1—
letic Department,” Pederson said.
“Anything that reﬂects in a negative
way on the University is very disap-
pointing to us.”

In July, former defensive end Ja-
baal Sheard pleaded guilty to disor-
derly conduct and was permitted to
rejoin the team after originally facing

charges of aggravated assault and
resisting arrest.

Runningbackjason Douglas was
charged with aggravated assault by
vehicle after allegedly strikingaper-
son with a car while driving under
the inﬂuence. Keith Coleman, an of-
fensive lineman, was charged with
aggravated assault and disorderly
conduct. Safety Jeff Knox was ac-
cused of disorderly conduct, simple
assault and recklessly endangering
another person. — V

Douglas, Coleman and Knoxwere
all suspended from the team.

“We have had students that have
made mistakes and when they’ve
made mistakes they’ve paid a very
high price in an awﬁil lot of cases,”
Pederson said. -

On the same day the Sports Illus-
trated/ CBS News article was released,
former Pitt football player Fernando
Diaz was arrested after a confronta-
tionwith the police.

Todd Graham, who was named 4

the Pitt head football coach in]anu-
ary, said he knew about the situation
involving the team’s recent problems
with the law from day one.

“I was very, very aware of the
situation and it’s not something we
startedtalkingabout today,” Graham
said. “We started talking about it the
very ﬁrst meeting.” I a

He said he’s going to emphasize
acting in “the Pitt way.”

“[That means] character, inten-
sity, discipline and accountability,” he
said. “All we can do is press forward
from here.”

He also said that he doesn’t expect
the investigation to have an impact
on recruiting.

“You need to reap what you sow,”
he said. “I think kids will meet what-
ever expectation you set and we set
very,very high standards. The pointl
made today is that the standard isn’t
that you didn’t get arrested; our stan-
dard is much higher than that.”

Pederson said Pitt is focusing
on educating and mentoring the
student athletes in order to com-
municate that they have a respon-
sibility to themselves, their families
and the University to uphold a high
standard. *

_,“They take that seriously,” he
said. “Certainly, they feel as bad as
anybody.” I

Men who inspired “The Fighter” speak at Pitt

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

__i9lhen Micky Ward was a kid, he used to
play pretend. I-Ie’d walk downstairs to the
basement and go three rounds with the
entire Olympic boxing team, coming up-
stairs afterward exhausted and drenched
in sweat.

That was the beginning of a successful
career for Ward, who started boxing when
he was 7 years old. A former World Boxing
Union champion, Ward, along with his
brother Dicky Eklund, eventually became
the focus of the Oscar-nominated movie
“The Fighter.” *

 Last night, the Pitt Program Council
brought both Ward and Eklund to the Wil-
liam Pitt Union and the two former boxers
answered questions from Richard Farrell,
a friend who consulted on the screenplay
for “The Fighter,” about their careers, rela-
tionship and experience with the movie.

“I was always going to the gym with
[Dicky] ,” Ward said from a seat on stage. “I
started ﬁghting because of Dicky. I thought
I would do it just to stay in shape. I never

thought I’d do it as a profession.”

Eklund once had a promising career
of his own as a three—time Golden Gloves
Champion. In 1978, he faced Sugar Ray
Leonard in a ﬁght shown on HBO. After
watching a clip of the ﬁght on a projector
screen, Eklund said he never let the idea
of going against Leonard get to him. .

“He has two hands, I have two hands,”
he said.

But Eklund’s struggle with drugs ended
his career in 1985 and a clip of an HBO
special that documented his addiction to
crack cocaine showed the drastic change
in Eklund from his days as a ﬁghter.

He said he didn’t know how good he
was until it was too late.

“I should’ve kept training hard,” he
said. “But everything was so easy to get.
I knew [Micky] couldn’t make the same
mistakes I made.”

Ward said he thought about walking
away during Eklund’s battle with drugs
and crime, but that he never went through
with the idea. , V

“It’s family, you just can’t give up on
somebody because they have a problem,”

TRACK AND FIELD

Pitt to compete in indoor championships this VV€€l(€I1(l;

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Formanytrackandﬁeld athletes, the season really
starts when outdoor competition begins. But it’s
zvduring the indoor season that goals are set and
 reﬁned.
3 “The outdoor season is really considered the
season because itiswhatyouwillremember most
. since it isthe lasttimeyouwillbe competingbefore
‘going home for the summer or ending your col-
legiate career,” Pitthead coachAlonzo Webb said.
r‘“I‘he indoor season lets you knowwhatyou need
4 to work on heading into the outdoor season.”
V Although the indoor season can be seen as a
ipreparatory time, it does allow for competitive
meets, includingtheupcomingwomen’s and men’s
championships to be held this weekend.

Both Pitt squads will travel to Boston, with
fthe women competing in the Eastern Collegiate
?Athletic Conference Championships and the men
‘ taking part in the Intercollegiate Association of
-AmateurAthletes of America Championships.

i The women’s team is coming off of a ninth-

 place ﬁnish in the recent Big East Indoor Cham-

ipionships where 11 top-nine ﬁnishes were
earned.

Inthat meet, the4x4oo relayteam, composed

of seniors Brianna Broyles, Da’Lynn Mills, Kate-

lynn Brown and sophomorejonnique Lawrence
took home second place with a time of 3:42.36,
whereas freshman Ashley Corum ﬁnished ﬁrst
in the triple jump with a career-high 12 .51-meter
leap.
ForWebb, the success of Corum and otherﬁrst—
year competitors is noteworthy and somethingto
watch for in this weekend’s competition.

Micah Murray:

of something great,” Murray said. ‘A bond was
formed, butwe knowthatthisbondis only going

Eklund became Ward’s trainer

‘Fighter’ 4 14

' Ward said. “He was a great trainer.”

After Eklund’s career ended, he became

,Ward’s full-time trainer. Eklund spent time
in prison during Ward’s career and said
that his goal for after he got out was for
,Ward to become champion of the world —
‘a title he eventually claimed in 2000.

A“I’always knew he was going to be some-
thing,” Eklund said.

After viewing a clip of Ward’s ﬁght
against Alfonso Sanchez, the brothers

1 demonstrated Ward’s signature punches,
in which Ward gives his opponent a tap
to the head so his hand will go up and
then hits him in the liver to stop the blood
ﬂow.

Asked if Ward ever got the best of him
when they were sparring, Eklund replied
ﬁthat Ward knocked him out on one occa-

sion. Ward added that the knock-out blow
was retribution for when he was younger
and Eklund was faster and stronger.

“When did you wake up?” Farrell asked
about Ward’s knock-out punch.

“Today,” Eklund joked.

. Both Eklund and Ward said they enjoyed
the experience of “The Fighter.” Ward said
the movie had been in the works for years,
often starting and then getting postponed.
But Mark Wahlberg, who portrayed Ward
in the movie, kept pushing for the movie
to be made. '

“He’s a good guy. He always wanted to
play a ﬁghter,” Ward said. “He did a hell
of a job.” A v

Ward added that Wahlberg took a train-
er with himto every movie he worked on

so he could stay in shape for when “The :;

Fighter” went into production.

“He could do very well at ﬁghting if
he wanted to, guaranteed,’? Ward said of

’ Wahlberg... 

Christian Bale, who earned the Best
Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal
of Eklund, still keeps in touch with the
man he portrayed. “ T  g p

‘Dickenese.”’

Farrell ended the interview portion of
the evening by showing the entire ninth
round of Ward’s ﬁght against Arturo Gatti,
which is widely regarded as one of the
greatest boxing rounds of all time.

The ninth—round knockdown provided
Ward with the majority decision and the
