Capt.Jack E. Foley rarely talked about
ﬁghting in World War II.

So Elaine Foley, :1 Pitt senior, did
not begin to understand what her
grandfather had been through until
her 11th grade history teacher as-
signed the book “Band of Brothers.”

Both thebook and the HBO mini-
series. of the same name follow the
men of the U.S. Army’s 506th -Parag

immortalized as Easy Company, as
they seek to conquer the Nazis during
World War II.

Foley, one of the paratroopers, suf~
fered through an icy blockade in~Bas-
togne, France, slept in cold trenches
in Belgium and helped overtake Adolf

Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest mountain retreat

Jack Foley, a Pitt alumnus, died
Monday of complications from Type

He rarely shared his.WWII sto~

children.

“He never really talked about it,
and we never asked,” Elaine Foley
said.’ “He was just our grandpa. Our

When Foley’s teacher required

 her class to read “Band of Brothers,”
‘ things changed.

Korean fest honors G—2O

Community hosts fl’l’St Korean festival to welcome foreign leaders '

To honor Korea’s presence in
both the G-20 Summit and in
Pittsburgh, the city’s Korean
community came together for
its ﬁrst annual Korean Festival

yesterday.

When they found out that
Korea will be represented at the

The Korean Association of
Greater Pittsburgh and the K0-

hosted the ﬁve-hour festival in
the Cathedral of Learning com-

Patrick Shin, an emcee for the
festival, said the occasion was
more than just a celebration about

“Dr. Lee wanted this event to
teach Korean descendants who
weren’t born in Korea to learn
more about Korean culture,” Shin
said. “We also wanted to show
foreign Koreans that the Korean
community in the U.S. are wel-
coming them here, too.”

Guests enjoyed many presen-
tations throughout the event. A
local group of Pittsburgh students
performed Taekwondo demon-
strations for the crowd, including
punching, kicking and ﬁghting
sets. The performers broke wood-

Watching the 2001 HBO miniseries pro-

duced by Steven Spielberg was another story

altogether. Foley said she was shocked when
she saw some of the obstacles her grandfather
had to overcome.

“I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I thought,
‘That’s my grandpa.’ It was so sad and upset-
ting to see him going through all of that I had
no idea.”

_ 4 Jack Foley was 21 when he joined the army.

A Pitt senior studying political science and eco-

nomics, he and 19 members of his ROTC unit
entered the army onjune 29, 1943.

Five months later, Foley graduated from of-
ﬁcer candidate school as alieutenantinthe Coast
Artillery Corps. He wentfrom guardingthe Puget
Sound, an inland waterwayinwashington, to the
Paciﬁc Ocean, to Fort Benning, in Georgia.

After he completedhis paratrooper training
in October 1944, Foleywas shipped to Scotland
and then to Holland. There, he led a platoon as
Easy Company fought to liberate Holland.

His team endured bitter weather, injuries,

illnesses and terrible violence during the Battle
of the Bulge before capt11ringHitler’s Eagle’s Nest
retreat in the German Alps.

Foley was shot in the wrist in the Alsatian
town of Haguenau near the German border
before the war ended. He received the Purple

Jenny Hempen, another emcee, said
the event showed non-Koreans how dif-
ferent Korean culture is from other Asian ‘
cultures.

“Chinese andjapanese culture is pretty
well-known,” said Hempen. “But I think
Korean culture has a lot of personality and
passion.”

' Shin agreed.

“We use different characters and speak
a different language than the Chinese and
Japanese,” he said. “We have very different
food, too. We’re a passionate people, and I
think this event showed that.”

Editorial

Soda tax a tiptoe in

the right direction

nder the contentious pro-

I I posed tax on soft drinks,

a can of soda might cost

more than that crumpled dollar
bill in your pocket.

The tax, which has yet to make
its way through Congress, on sug-
ary soft drinks won’t be limited to
soda pop, however. Energy drinks,
sports beverages, juices and iced-
tea will be taxed, as well, accord-
ing to The New York Times. Diet
sodas are exempt from the tax
despite their potentially harm-
ful artiﬁcial sweeteners.

As Americans, we’re somewhat
accustomed to governmental
regulation of what goes into our
bodies. Cigarettes and alcohol are
far from healthy —— we’ve known
that for decades. To dissuade our
intake of such products, the gov-
ernment has affixed sin taxes é
special taxes levied on products
viewed as objectionable — to
these goods. Sugar—laced bever-
ages might not carry the carci-
nogenic toxins of a smoldering
cigarette, but they’re still a prime
culprit responsible for America’s
expanding waistline and a con-
tributor to our millions of cases
of heart disease.

Some — particularly, the soda
pop industry — view this new tax
as unnecessary and question its
real effectiveness. The causes
behind obesity are complex and
diverse.

The tax sure isn’t a magic ﬁx
for swelling obesity rates. But who
said it was supposed to be? The
tax probably won’t be enough to
deter the steadfast soda lover. Yet
it might be enough to persuade
an addict to cut down by a can or
two a day.

Neither is the beverage tax a

savior for the health care indus-
try’s ailing revenue. But at a time
when the future of health care
in this nation stands at a pivotal
crossroads, one thing’s for sure:

Our health care system is going to '

need all the money it can get.
The projected rate stands at

approximately one cent per ﬂuid

ounce of the beverage. A 12-can
case with 12-ounce cans sells for
around $3.20. The tax would add
$1.44. The tax could raise $14.9
billion in its ﬁrst year.

So would the new fee deter
soda pop lovers? A research
study on the price elasticity of
soft drinks showed that for ev-
ery 10 percent rise in the price,
consumption decreases between
8 to 10 percent.

Given the contention this tax
continues to face on the national
level, it might be better for states
to decide the matter independent-

ly. If nothing else, the tax might ’

have a better chance of instate-
ment on a state level. Some are
bound to ﬁnd it favorable. We
wonder, though, why this tax is
to be levied on sugary beverages
alone? There is a smorgasbord of
unhealthy foods weighing down
Americans. Convenience store
snacks like candy bars and cook-
ies sure aren’t helping America’s
waistline, yet one can still pay for
these products with a pocketful of
loose change. ,

Also, if this tax really aims for
salubrious results, why not tar-
get those beverages rich with caf-
feine? The health pros and cons of
coffee are a topic of debate in and
of themselves. But reaching for a
cola over a cup of coffee means an
energy boost plus a hefty dose of
sugar and calories.

Thuppal: Aid more than just penning a check

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

 

I have often been impressed by
how much money well-to—do sub-
urbanites are willing to pump into
aid organizations simply because
they have a picture of a starving
African child on their poster. Be-
lieving they are helping to change
the world, they reach for their
checkbooks and wallets in order
to avoid any meaningful action for
their cause du jour.

‘ Though they mean well, one
danger in donating to-these or-
ganizations is that it creates a cap
on how much one can help. Dol-

lars are measurable. One can stop’

giving them, claiming that he has
already given so much to so many
causes. ,

For three years, I worked for
such an organization and helped
to open up hearts and wallets en
route to funding hospitals over-
sees. However, after some time,
I became unsatisﬁed with the re-
sults, knowing that I could only

offer money and not much more.

In this way, I was secure and
didn’t need to take any extra ef-
forts to concern myself with the
people Iwas helping. Having given
them the set amount needed to
buy books or satisfy their hunger, I
moved on with the understanding
that my work was done.

Let me state that any projects
that are looking to improve the
quality of life around the world
should be commended. However,
their success in funneling cash to
these poorer nationshas left us
with a sense of detached indif-
ference.

When we see statistics showing
that so many millions of dollars

“have been used to combat "AIDS
and that so many schools have
been built for disadvantaged chil-
dren, we want to stop and be satis-
ﬁed with our accomplishments.

And this includes stopping with
respect to helping those in our
own neighborhoods. When groups
such as Amnesty International and
Invisible Children post unnerving
statistics about the slaughter of

millions oversees, we are quick
to reach out to these numbers in-
stead of our neighbors.

case. If we can understand that
changing lives has much more
to do with human interaction,

6C 

[Charities’] success in funneling cash to
these poorer nations has left us with a,
sense of detached indifference.

In believing that we have done
our part, we ‘retire to our comfort-
able lives, believing that others
can carry the torch from here on
out.

As I stated, these groups are
doing wonderful projects around
the world that will surely bring

opportunity and hope to people‘

that had none before. But they are
unwillingly spreading a shallow
ideology, in which the amount that
one should.he1p others is conﬁned
to dollars. 4

But this does not have to be the

we may begin to reverse these
notions of helping only through
money. Just around the city, a few
organizations have adopted this
mentality.

At the local level, helping oth-
ers can be much more meaningful
through nonproﬁts such as Pitts-
burgh Cares. The group works to
provide volunteer opportunities
involving care for seniors and as-
sisting with community events. Al-
though one is not working directly
to save the lives of others, the con-
nections made and the gratitude

received will have as much of a
positive impact on the helper as
on those being helped.

Even on an international level,
money is not the only thing that
can be used to change lives. Orga-
nizations such as the Pittsburgh-
based Global Links have made
their name by developing creative
and low-cost methods of aid. For
example, Global Links recycles
surplus medical supplies and ships
them to developing nations where
they are in desperate need.

Initiatives such as these ask
only for volunteers to give their
time and energy as opposed to di-
rectly paying to help others. And
in that, helping others is no longer
calculated in dollars.

As the world’s wealthiest na-
tion, the United States and its
people probably feel a necessity to
help those in developing nations.
But hopefully, in the future, they
will not forget that aid extends
beyond the simple act of writing
a check.

Watch out boys: Megan Fox wants toeatyou

The Diablo Cody and Megan Fox pairing might seem like a match made in heaven, but it’s a lukewarm endeavor

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

Megan Fox is astoundingly hot. That

is an inarguable fact. .

Her latest movie, however, is
not.

In fact, the “Mean Girls” meets
“Carrie” hybrid that is “_]ennifer’s
Body” is frequently colder than the
lifeless male corpses on which Fox
munches throughout the ﬁlm.

While never generating even a
hint of tension or scariness and only
sparsely connecting with the awk-
ward dark humor, the ﬁlm amounts
to nothing more than adisappointing
misstep for the talented individuals
involved.

When the news was armounced
that Academy Award-winning “Juno”
scribe Diablo Cody was penning a
teen horror movie, there was much
speculation as to how her signature
hipster—speak would translate to the
horror genre.

When the news that Fox would
play a literal man—eating seduc-
tress hit the Web, the skeptics were
silenced by the Angelina _]olie-in-
training, tab1oid—ready personality
and radiating beauty.

Foxas an “honest—to-blog” spout-
ing queen bee who eats boys? The
movie could practically make itself!

Unfortunately, something went

wrong along the way, because the
only thing atwhich the ﬁlm succeeds

is reminding audiences of how irri-
tating Cody’s perception of teenage

conversation patterns really is. ‘

Levinson: Forget sexy —— new film to bring badassback

According to Noah, the era of “badass” film characters is not dead yet. In fact, it might be making a comeback.

Noah Levinson
Contributing Editor

 

 

Badass.

Letthe word soakinforabit. What
does it mean‘? Is itaperson who we glo-
rifyandcanonlydreamtobeoneday?
Maybe more of a man or woman who
will do whatever ittal<es to accomplish
his goal. Perhaps it's just a dude or du-
dette with whom you shouldn’t mess.

Butinmovies, does badassery even-
tua1lyfade?Oncean actor reaches 65, is
he no longer a big-screen badass?

Hell no.

Several days ago, the oﬁicial trailer
for “Harry Brown” stormed the Inter-
net.

Directed by newcomer Daniel Bar-
ber, the moviestars76—year-old Michael
Caine as not Bruce Wayne’s butler, but
ratheramanoutforgruesome revenge
against a group of London punks who
kill his bestﬁiend.

Cainehas beenabadass fromthe
beginning -— see 1971’s “Get Carter”
to truly appreciate Caine’s macho in-
stincts. I:.\/en though there have been
only afew similar roles thnoughouthis
career (i.e., “Miss Congeniality” and
“Bewitched”), Caine certainly still has
that tough guy in him.

The plot line isn’t original, but it’s
alwaysfuntowatcholderactors kicking
ass. For instance, 2008’s “Taken” had
an older Liam Neeson, reaping ven-
geance atterhis daughteris kidnapped

overseas.

Even if Robert Pattinson
gained some muscle A
mass, De Niro could still
beat him to a pulp.

A more worthy example ofelderly
revenge, though, comes from’ Clint
Eastwood in 2008’s “Gran Torino.”

Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a

widow living alone in a violent area
of Detroit. Kowalski is introduced as
a stereotypical racist septiragenarian.
But after meeting his young Hmong

‘neighbor, Kowalski becomes slightly

less racist. ,

Didi mentionthatKowalski is aKo—
rean War veteran — a badass Korean
Warveteran? ‘

Nothing is more entertainingthan

_ watchinghelplessoldmenﬁghttoprove

that those liver spots don’t deﬁne who
theyare. It’s the amount ofviolencethat
they create thatdeﬁnes their lives.

Maybe itis also asign thatourHol—.

Andrl would much rather prefer

Robert De Niro, the manfrom “Good-
fellas,”“RagingBull”and“’I‘axiDriver”
to play the badass he is, no matterhis

Even if Robert Pattinson gained
some muscle mass, De Niro could still

Erickjordan, frontman of the folk-rock group
The Rosewood Thieves, has a theory for why
music has deteriorated: accessibility.

“I just think it’s so easy to make music now,”
Jordan said. “Your ears are kind of ﬂooded with
crap. Therewas as many crappy bands out inthe
760s and ’70s,but none ofthem could affordto go
to astudio and record those crappy songs. So you

. neverheardthem—whichisbest.Now,anybody

canbe approachable and justrecordtl1eircrappy

_ songs and put it on MySpace.”
Jordan’s answer to this overexposure of me— .

diocrityis The Rosewood Thieves — aband that
prefers to dwell on the warmer, less digitalized
sounds of classic rock.
“You don’t have all these overdubs,” Jordan
said. “You need to hear mess—ups.”

Jordan, analive ofEastSt1'oudsburg, Pa., said
the band’s particular rock ’n’ roll purism was
always there.

Jordan met the ﬁrst members of the Thieves
while attending a boarding school in California,
and, united by their shared love of a bygone era,
he and the others moved to New York City to

trying, it’sijusthowwe always sound .” ._

ﬁrst EP.

“At that poir1t, everybody kind of quitawhati

they were doing and were like, ‘Let’s just go for
this,”’Jordan said. A

'I‘hatwinter, afterbeingholed up inacramped
apartment, the ﬂedging band was offered an
upstate New Yorkfarmhouse inwhichtolivefree
of charge — an experience many would consider
an idyllic artistic endeavor. But notjordan.

“Itwas really hard,” he said. “We were really
youngand stupid. Itwas very cold. Itwas like an
abandoned house, basically. It wasn’t the most

’ prime place to be. But it was fun looking back.” -

Despite its Siberian standard of living, the
band managed to turn outacareenboosling EP,
Fmm the Deoéer Heme. _

With Lennon-esque singing and sublime
blues, allmusic.com called it “an understated
beauty.” The album was soon featured in Paste
magazine’s “Band of the Week” feature, inwhich
Jordan joked, “My ear just doesn’t accept any-
thing from 1975 on.”

Followingthis was another EP (Lmarome) and

the band’s ﬁrstﬁ1ll—length album, the cozy Rae and '

S /Jine, which earned the band sound comparisons
to legendary rock bands like The Beatles.

  Mason makes case for starting middle linebacker job

The freshman played for an injured Adam Gunn and led the Panthers to a 27-14 win over Navy

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

It looks like the Pittfootball team has
a quarterback controversy after all.

It’s not Bill Stull against Tino Sun-
seri, though. It’s Dan Mason against
Adam Gurm at middle linebacker, or
“the quarterback of the defense” as
Masoncalled it after Pitt’s 27-14 win
over Navy on Saturday.

Gunn, a senior, started Pitt’s ﬁrst
two games at middle linebacker and
led the team with 19 tackles and ﬁve
sacks. Against Buffalo two weeks
ago, Gurm sprained his left ankle in
Pitt’s 54-27 victory. Although he only
missed a few plays in that game, he
didn’t play against Navy.

That opened up the starting
linebacker spot for Mason, a fresh-
man. He ﬁnished the game with a
team-high 11 tackles and two sacks,
tying Mick Williams for most on the
team. - 7

- As a middle linebacker, Mason
has to run the huddle, call plays and
anchorthe entire defense. Mason
was nervous in his ﬁrst start, saying,
“As a freshman, it’s a big deal.”

“He was makingall thecalls [and]
was conﬁdent with it too,” defensive
end Greg Romeus said. “He’s a young
guy, but didn’t act like it.”

Mason and the Pitt defense gave
up 218 total yards, only 89 coming
through the air. Navy’s leading re-
ceiverwas Mike Schupp, who caught
two passes for 24 yards. To putthat
in some perspective, Stull had 23
receiving yards himself. One of the

. ' quarterback’s passes was tipped at

the line of scrimmage and he caught
it and ranfor 23 yards. "
Part of the reason for so few
passing yards is because Navy is an
extremely run-oriented team. The
Midshipmen ranfor 129 yards on 46
carries, or 2.8 yards per carry. '
The Panthers’ prowess on defense
is all the more impressive given they
didn’t know they would be without
Gurm until the day before the game.

In only his third career game, Dan Mason made his ﬁrst

Coach Dave Warmstedt said Gunn
practiced all week but didn’t seem
ready to play. He said he expects
Gunn to play next Saturday when Pitt
travels to North Carolina State.

Although Gunn is the starter,
it’s clear Mason needs to get on the
ﬁeld.

Whether that means moving ei-
ther Gunn or Mason to one of the
outside linebacker positions or just

having Gunn and Mason split timing
at middle linebacker, Wannstedt has
a good problem on his hands. And
he’s aware of it.

When asked if Mason will play
next week, Wannstedt said, “We’ll
look at the tape [of Mason playing
in the Navy game] ,” then paused for
about two seconds before cracking
awide grin.

“He’s going to play.”

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

Ashley Cuba scored a goal in each r
period as the Pitt women’s soccer .

team defeated St. Bonaventure 4-0
at Founders Field on Sunday.

The Panthers had a quick start,
with two goals coming within the
ﬁrst 20 minutes of play.

The early offensive barrage

surprised many, considering the
Panthers played to a 1-1 double
overtime tie against West Virginia
on Friday.

But Pitt head coach Sue-Moy
Chin said she knew the importance
of a successful ﬁrst period because

A the Panthers might start feeling the

effects of the West Virginia game as
time passed.

‘‘That’s something we stressed
in pre-game — getting an early

jump on them and starting out
strong,” Chin said. “Especially
after Friday night, with how long
and hard we played, we knew we
weren’t going to have good legs.”

Cuba made the ﬁrst goal in the
12th minute off a Katelyn Ruhe as-
sist.

Pitt’s Laura Berbert followed
with a goal in the 19th minute to
give the Panthers a 2-0 advan-
tage.

The 2-0 lead held until the
break, and Pitt took an 8-2 shot
advantage into halftime.

In the second quarter, the Pan-
thers showed no signs of weariness
from their game on Friday.

They even added to their lead
in the ﬁnal minutes of play.

Lyndsay Pierson beat the goalie
for a score in the 79th minute, and
Cuba assisted on the play.

Leaping 
Baldwin leads
passing game.

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

The running game has always been a
staple of the Pitt offense, but against
Navy a new feature of the offense
emerged — an explosive passing
game.

By game’s end, nine Panther?‘
caught a pass, includingquarterback
Bill Stull, in a 27-14 victory over Navy.
But of all the players, no Panther
is better suited to lead the passing
attack than wide receiverjonathan
Baldwin — especially when he’s in
single coverage, like he was for a
majority of the Navy game.

And by now, everyone knows this
motto: If Baldwin is in one—on-one
coverage, throw him the ball.

“No. 82, one—on-one with any-
one, I’m going to like my matchup?‘
Stull said.

The No. 82 is graceﬁilly worn by
Baldwin, a sophomore whose 6—foot—
5-inch frame and athleticism allow
him to dazzle with spectacular leap-
ing catches.

Stull is also conﬁdent in Bald-
win’s jumping ability..

“He always tells me, ‘Bill, just
give me a chance, put it up in the air.
I’m going to jump,”’ Stull said. “I’m
like, ‘J B, I know you got the 42-inch
vertical and you’re going to jump‘
over someone.’ I just make sure I try
and give him a chance and throw a
good’ ball.”

When I get the one-on-
one opportunity, I just go up 4,
and catch the ball.

Jonathan Baldwin

Both players acknowledged that
against Navy, Pitt wanted to “opeft
it up more” and throw deep passes

When I’m sad, stressed or gassy, I reach for a
sports movie.

Sports movies combine the two best forms
of entertainment — sports and movies. Who-
ever invented this combo deserves a Medal of
Freedom.

I can watch sports movies all day. Films like
“61,” which is masterful, “Cobb,” which is poi-
gnant and “Slap Shot,” which, with the late great
Paul Newman, is unforgettable. L

My guilty pleasure, though, is “The Replace-
ments,” at 2000 ﬁlm about owners in a ﬁctional
football league bringing in replacement players
during a strike. - -

‘ So when I heard that the NBA planned to lock
out referees on Oct. 1, and bringin replacement
ofﬁcials-until the two sides reach a labor agree-
ment, I ruffled through my movie collection and
popped in the disc to do some research:

’ I assume the followingfewweeks will mirror
the plot of “The Replacements.” ‘ -

Negotiations between the two sides collapsed
when the referees backed out of an agreement

over retirementbeneﬁts. Big-money issues such *

as per diems and dental plans also divide the
league and referees. '
, Referees accused the league of using them
_ to set an example for the players. The players’
collective bargaining agreementwith the league
ends in a year, and league commissioner David
Stern might be drawing a hard line now.
A But the conference room haggling about
pensions and dentists grew tiring after a few
’ days. . _ - V .

Then news broke that the NBA e-mailed 44
officials fromthe WNBA and lesser professional
leagues about refereeing preseason andsome
regular season games. Replacements.

Cue the openingscredits.

Stern will contact retired actor Gene Hack-
man to search forthe best serni-pro and WNBA
referees hiding in the greater Washington
area. ’ ‘

Early in his journey, Hackman will ﬁnd Not
Keanu Reeves living in a houseboat and will tell
Reeves he has heart. “You have heart,” he’ll say.
“Your ability to emphatically call ablockingfoul
rivals the greats.” '

 

Hackman will put together an oddball group
of referees so laughable it just might work. Or-
landojones, nowforgotten in the entertainment
world, will revitalize his career when he keeps a
straight face telling Celﬁcs coach Doc Rivers he
didn’t see the charge, even though he did.

John Madden and Pat Summerall will show
up and provide commentary for no reason.
Madden will even give Stern advice. After all,
last week he became a special adviser to NFL
Commissioner Roger Goodell.

‘ Early on, the replacements will fail miser-
ably. Fans, though, won’t notice the difference.
Crowds already see officials as inconsistent at
best and disgraced ofﬁcial-turned-convict Tim
Donaghy at worst. »

But four weeks and several team—building
montages later, the replacement referees will
grow into a cohesive unit, earning the respect
of even the vilest ﬁrst—row hecklers.

Wlien the lockout inevitably ends, the re- A

placements will be relegated once again to the
D-Leagues and houseboat living. Ifeel another
montage. _

The real referees will return with their cushy
dental plans and per diems. Hackmanwill note
to Stern, “They lack heart.”

Several rah—rah speeches later, Not Reeves
andjones will ﬁnd themselves back on the big
stage, oﬁiciating a big playoff game.

“I can’t do it,” Reeves will say. “I’m not good
enough!”

“But, kid, you have heart!” Hackman will

respond. “Now go reflike a pro!”

In abeautiﬁil moment, Reeves andjones will -

put their whistles away in the ﬁnal minute of the
game. Stern willwipe a j oyous tear from his eye.
“They have learned so much,” he will say.

“I remember-when they were timidly calling
fouls by the book just a few months ago,” Hack-
man will reminisce. ‘

After the game — what team won doesn’t
matter, as it’s always about the referees —

. Reeves and Jones will ride off into the sunset.

“The Replacements: Referee Lockout” willﬁlm
next summer. ’ g

Hackman will quote “Damn Yankees!” once
more and prattle on about heart before re-en-
tering retirement. 4

Coincidentally, Hackman watched “Danm
Yankees!” before the game because he felt a
little gassy. ’

Baldwin
converts two
fourth downs

Baldwin 4 11

to complement the running game. This was a
plan devised by offensive coordinator, Frank
Cignettijr.

Fortunately for Pitt, the Stull-Baldwin con-
nection worked. i A

Stull looked Baldwin’s way twice on key
fourth-down conversions in Pitt’s win.

The two conversions, one a22-yard strike
on fourth—and-three and the other an 11-yard
completion on fourth-and-seven, led to 10

- Pitt points.

Yet even on those pressure-packed passes,
Baldwin can humbly describe his responsibili-
ties in securing the catch.

“I just have to run my route and try to get
open and make a play for my team,” Baldwin
said. “I have to be alert for where the sticks_
are, too, and just continue to try and make
plays.”

It’s apparent Baldwin is becoming Pitt’s
safety valve on offense. The ease with which
Baldwin takes to the air isn’t overestimated.
Baldwin practices his skills in the week lead-
ing up to games. .

Both Stull and Baldwin said one—on-one
drills are a part of practice each week. Through
three games, it’s clear the connection is start-

‘ ing to show promise.

Simply put, Baldwin said, “When I get the
one-on-one opportunity, I just go up and catch
the ball.”

Panthers shut out once again «

Louisville beat the Pitt men ’s soccer team 5-0, which is its ﬁfth shut out in the past six games

Adam Littman and Alex Oltmanss
Staff Report

With a 5-0 loss yesterday to Louisville, the
Pitt men’s soccer team has lost six consecu-
tive games, scoring just three goals during
that stretch.

All three of those goals came in a4-3 over-

time loss to Santa Barbara, meaning Pitt (1-6-1,

0-2-0 Big East) has been shut out in ﬁve of its
last six games.

Of course, it’s hard to score when you take
zero shots on goal, as the Panthers did against
Louisville. Pitt had six shots altogether. The
Cardinals had 19, including eight shots on
goal.

No. 13 Louisville (5-0-1, 2-o-o Big East) took
control earlyin the game, as Paolo DelPiccolo
scored the game’s ﬁrst goal on a rebound.

Within the next minute. and a half, Louis-
ville added goals by Othaniel Yanez and Buck
Tufty to give the Cardinals a 3-0 lead head-

2

ing into the half. Goals by Freddie Braun and
Brent Rosendall in the second half brought
the Panther deﬁcit to ﬁve.

Luckily for the Panthers, their next game
is against DePaul.

Heading into yesterday’s action, DePaul was?

12th in the 16—team conference in goals allowed _

with eight in ﬁve games. The Blue Demons also
have yet to shut out a team this year.

The game is Friday at 7 p.m. at Founders
Field. -

Ruhe,Cubathe
‘unsungheroes’
of the victory

set up a goal for Cuba in the 84th minute to
produce the ﬁnal margin of victory.

“Itwas a great setup by Ruhe playing it
in to Habbel, and Habbel did a great job in
serving the ball across,” Chin said.

“I think those two were the unsung he-
roes of that goal.” .

Cuba led the Panthers with three shots
on goal. Pitt out-shot the Bonnies 14-7 and
ﬁnished with a 7-4 advantage in shots on
goal. _

“Playing a complete game is something
that we’ve been working on,” Chin said. “We
played well in our other games, but having
that strong start is something we’ve been
looking for.” ' V

The Panthers return to action on Sept. 24,
when they take on South Florida at Founders

Field at 7 p.m.
