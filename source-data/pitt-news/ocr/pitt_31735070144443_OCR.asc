they‘are here, they feel lonely and
this is a chance to make friends,”
said Liu. She anticipated an atten-
dance of over 800 people. "

Liu said she wanted to wish
everyone a happy Chinese New

Even on Sunday morning, the
dancers, moralers and casual par-
ticipants kept the party going with
47square, talking and, of course,
dancing.

The greek—sponsored Pitt Dance
Marathon took place from 11 a.m.

Saturday to 11 a.m. Sunday in the

Fitzgerald Field House and raised
a total of $51,249.19 this year for
the Lung and Thoracic Malignan-
cy Program at the University of

a Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. .

Some of the most enthusiastic
dancing came as dancers strived
to reach the ﬁnal goal of staying
standing until 11 a.m. A

“My feet are killing me,” said

Pitt student and dancer Hans

Glas. » A

Earlier in the marathon, Glas
said he felt enthusiastic about the
next 13 hours.

“It’s amazing,” he said. “If peo— S

ple aren’t here, they are absolutely,
entirely wrong.”

Glas and his group of moralers,
people assigned to keep the danc-
er awake and having fun, spent
the majority of the time dancing.

One of Glas’ moralers, Pitt ju-
nior Cameron Giles, stayed with
him through the whole night ex-
cept for a four-hour nap.

“I want people to -know Chi-

especially to know China,” said
Wang. P
Wang said that the event be-

‘gan because Chinese students

were feeling disconnected from
the New Year’s celebrations of
their friends and relatives in Chi-
na. Wang said that, though the
event was originally just held for
Chinese ‘citizens, it has been ex-
panded to include all members of
the community. I

“F6: the CSSA, we try to be
non-political and non—religious
in every way. We want to bring

everyone together for fun,” said

Wang. “It’s just for fun.”

Jian Li, a chemistry graduate ,

student, said. that the association
exists primarily to build connec-
tions among the Chinese students,
fellow international students and
Americans at the University. Li
was excited about the arrival of
the new year.

“This kind of celebration has
been going on for 5,000 years,”
‘said Li of the Spring Festival.
“For the Chinese, it’s more im-
portant than the Super Bowl.”

Li said that_ there are a num-
ber of foods that are traditionally
servedfor the festival, including
ﬁsh, pork, beef and jiao zi,'a spe-

' cial type of durnpling.

Li noted the importance of
ﬁreworks‘ in the celebration. Ac-
cording to tradition, ﬁreworks
were usedto produce noise that
would scare away a havoc-wreak-
ing mythical beast.

 said that his parents and
grandparents continue to’ reside

in China and that he regrets being

unable to be with them.

“Fortunately,” said Li, “I went
back [to China] this winter, and
we had a family reunion‘: Even
though I cannot have Spring Fes-
tival with them, I am glad that I
will see them again soon.”

The association is composed
of more than 1,000 students.
The Spring Festival is the major

activity the organization puts on, -
though there is also a talent show

and a number of different ath-
letic clubs.

Day-long dance event

The hours between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. pro-

‘ vided the greatest challenge, said Glas.

“Everyone started to fall asleep while
dancing,” he said.

At the beginning of the night, cancer
survivor and Pitt alumnus Shannon Barry
spoke to the crowd about his pride in the
Pitt greeks.

“They’ve created an event that funds re-
search that keeps our lives on track,” said
Barry.

Pitt senior Elyssa Gerst said stories like
Barry’s help to keep the dancers motivated
through the night.

Gerst has participated in the marathon
in some way every year since her freshman
year when it began. During that time, she
has never fallen asleep, and this year she
didn’t worry about it, she said.

Dinner lacked vegetarian options, said
Gerst, but besides that she said that the
event seemed better organized than in past
years. >

All of the 200 ofﬁcial dancers, moralers
and staff ate food donated from local res-
taurants such as Chipotle, Bruegger’s, Quiz-
no’s, Qdoba and Vocelli. Hundreds of other
attendees had to fend for themselves.

Dancing when she liked the music, Gerst
made it through to the end of the night with
the help of games and extra activities.

The marathon reached its peak after
midnight during the techno dance. The
students who showed up for this section
of the marathon seemed to outnumber the
dancers and formal participants.

“All the people dancing have just got
here,” said Gerst. A

With strobe lights ﬂashing, the D] played
a combination of remixed pop songs and
classic techno, and the staff handed out free
glow sticks to the dancers.

During the marathon, students could also

participate in games and activities spaced ;

out through the 24 hours.

At about 1 p.m., students played corn—
hole with equipment donated from the Pitt
Cornhole Club.

At about 3 p.m., the Eat ’n Park smi-
ley cookie mascot showed up, and students
decorated their own smiley cookies.

Students played water pong, “Guitar
Hero” and colored, as well. ~

The event also featured a variety of musi-
cal acts and entertainers, including the Pitt
drumline, D] B—Tips, D] Allbe, the Jungle

- and the Pitt dance team and cheerleaders.
Some students, such as Laura Fedoronko   "W 

and Kelly Coppler, showed up at the mara-

thOI'l j11St t0 SCC a certain gfOLlp  StOpp€d ""  '""'""'""”"' 

by the marathon to support the drumline.

Coppler, who only stayed for the begin—  .. ..  

ning of the marathon, said she liked the
concept but felt that the greeks could do
more with it.

The event also lost one of its biggest ce-
lebrities, Steelers kicker Jeff Reed, because
of the Super Bowl.

In order to keep the event alcohol-free,
overall captain Megan Mautz said the orga-
nizers posted security guards at the entrance
and did not allow anyone to carry liquid into
the building.

Medics took one girl suffering from dehy-
dration to the hospital early on in the event,
said Mautz, but the girl was released and in
good condition only a few hours later.

In the last hour, many of the participants
danced their hardest to ﬁnish up the mara-
thon. -

Pitt freshman Amanda Klepes said she
went through good and bad times, but she
still managed to toss her arms out and jump
around to the beat.

“It’s all mind over matter,” said Klepes.

Driving with cell phones
only safe if ‘hands free

Cell phone use while driving
has a ‘history of causing both
crashes and controversy.

' State Rep. Josh Shapiro, D-
Montgomery, tried in 2007 to pass
a bill that would prohibit hand-

held cell phone use while driving a

in Pennsylvania, according to the

' Pittsburgh Post—Gazette. The bill
‘ failed although it received sup-

port from 44 co-sponsors.
A couple of weeks ago, Sha-

piro announced he would re-

launch the bill. Despite a past
failure, Shapiro is heading down
the correct road.

Pennsylvania state police re-
ports revealed that in 2007 alone
hand-held cell phones contrib-
uted to 1,245 vehicle accidents.
Yet in that same year, only 56 ac-

cidents involved hands-free cell

phones.

The statistics provide irnmu-
table evidence that hand-held cell
phones are a legitimate disrup-
tion to drivers. They are a cause

i for both _fender-benders and se-_

vere, life-threatening automobile
accidents.

Although a bill banningpcell-
phone use while driving should
be passed right away, the policy
‘would bea waste of state legisla-

tors’ time if the new law were not A

properly enforced. A
Critics of the proposed law

‘ argue that the state police would

have no means of keeping the
lawiin check.

Proper enforcement of this
law would require, ﬁrst and .fore-
most, a strong effort by state
police: They must actively seek
violators.

The penalty for violating the
cell phone law should not be
merely tacked on to a driver’s re-

cord when he s committed a sep- .

arate violationor was involved in
an accident. A ,
To increase effectiveness, of-

ﬁcers would need to adamantly

target violators. If receiving a
ticket for driving while on a cell
phone» were as common as get-
ting a speeding ticket, the num-
ber of violators would most
likely diminish.

Under Shapiro’s bill, the pen-
alty for defying the cell phone
ban is a $50 fine. No points
would be added to the violator’s
license, however.

\With the ‘proposed conse-
quences, violators would not re-
ceive a strict enough punishment
so as to maximize the effective-
ness of the law. The fine should
be comparable to a serious
speeding ticket and points should
be added to the licenses of those
caught disregarding this law. '

Cell -phone prohibition laws
have spurred complaints from
those opposed to over-regulation
from government. Critics cite nu-
merous other driving distractions
— from blaring radios to eating
or drinking while driving — and
argue that such disturbances hin-
der driving ability on a compara-
tive level.

Yet the range of driver distrac-
tions is too diverse to implement
a policy for each one. Hand-held
cell phones are a ubiquitous dis-

' traction to drivers, and thus a

specific policy against their use is
warranted. ,

Pennsylvania should join the
six states -— including New Jer-
sey, California, Connecticut and
New York — that already pro-
hibit cell-phone use while driv-
ing.

Prison rape is inexcusable

by Levvis Lehe
Calumniat

 

One of President Barack
Obama’s first acts as president
was to close the Guantanomo
Bay detention facility. In the eyes
of the world, and most Ameri-
cans, the order marked a huge
step forward for human dignity.

After all, how could the

United States keep those people
jailed without a trial? How could-
the U.S. engage in torture of
prisoners?
' For many citizens serving
time in U.S. prisons, though,
life might be better if they had
gone ahead and joined Al Qaeda
before their court date. At least
at Guantanamo, nobody gets
raped. ' _ ’

Prison rape is far worse than
any of the interrogation meth-
ods that have _induced so much
shame. '

. The tragedy of prison rape

- isn’t just that itviolates what we
' feel are prisoners’ basic human

rights. After all, many people

believe everyone has a right to ,

health care, too. Yet some Amer-

' icans still die from curable dis- -

eases.

The tragedy of prison rape
is that it violates the Constitu-
tion. Before going the extra mile

to provide social services or put

on a good face for the world, the

president, Congress and courts”

have a sworn duty to obey the

éé
For many citizens serving
time in U.S. prisons, though,

had gone ahead and joined

‘date. At least at Guantanamo,
nobody gets raped.

Constitution — and the Con-
stitution prohibits cruel and un-
usual punishment. ‘
In fact, this provision is in the
Bill of Rights: Even our unsym-
pathetic founding fathers’, who
left slavery intact and women
unable to vote, thought the Con-
stitution was unacceptable with-
out the Eighth Amendment.‘
But is” prison rape “punish-

as

merit”? It isn’t stated by law or in
any sentence that anyone should
ever be raped. No judge ever
demands it as penitence for any
crime, no matter how horrible,
even in a country that upholds
the death penalty.

_ Prison rape is a useless pun-
is'hm‘ent' anyway. 'It’s a sentence
dealt unpredictably that doesn’t
afﬂict or deter, but actually’ em-

~ powers the strongest, the most

violent and the most _ruthless.
It’s a whip that falls most savage-

ly on the young, the effeminate,'

the weak, the inexperienced, the
trusting and those without gang
membership. g

However, to a simpleton ob-
server visiting the United States,
it would be hard to deny prison
rape isinot part of our punish-
ment system.

Some ﬁgures -claim between
200 and 300 thousand rapes oc-
cur behind bars in the United
States every year. Yet other es-
timates put the ﬁgure much
lower. ,

An iron code of silence reins
over so much of prison life that
it’s hard to separate fact from

p ﬁction. Prison rape happens, but

Rape inconsistent with prisoner rehabilitation

Lehe, page 4

it’s unclear how often and what’s consid-
ered rape and who’s doing the raping.

It’s undeniable, though, that the Amer-
ican public is brutally tolerant of prison
rape and considers it a de facto part of
punishment for law—breakers.

.On “CSI,” the investigators ‘— who are
protagonists — threaten suspects with the
prospect of prison rape. On a ﬁeld trip,
my roommate’s public high school class
walked a cell block while prisoners snarled
at them like animals, screaming they were
going to rape the boys.

The message was obvious: ‘7D’on’t go
to prison! You’ll get raped.” ‘

After Enron, California Attorney Gen-

eral Bill Lockyer went on the record with

surprising honesty and said, “I would love

P to personally escort [Ken] Lay to an 8—by-

\

10 cell that he could share with a tattooed
dude who says, ‘Hi, my name is "Spike,
honey?”

How can politicians claim that the pe-
nal system aims to rehabilitate while turn-
ing a blind eye to prison rape?

After a man is so abominably dehu-
manized, we can only hope that the man

‘so pampered and blessed, to put ourselves

. demands.

will be able to carry on the normal func-
tions of life, such as paying taxes, getting
his license renewed, giving correct change,
counting calories, talking to women, drink-
ing in moderation and thanking customers
for doing business with us.

It’s profoundly alien for us as students,

LetterToTheEditor

In a letter to the editor in Friday’s Pitt News, Patrick Graham made some claims regarding the standards we apply to our presidents. V _

The problem is this: If Obama is fantastically successful, he will receive a great deal of credit and be praised a hero. If he is unable to turn the failing economy around or prevent A
further‘ failures, people will excuse him due to the difficult situation he’s been left with. . ' i . ' '

Graham posed the question: “Is this a double standard?” and supplied us with an answer, ‘.‘Absolutely.” Graham suggests that hypocrisy ‘lies behind the claims that Bush was a
resounding failure, whereas it would be more fair were we to provide excuses for him. ’ '

Given the limited effectiveness of a person’s — even the president’s — abilities, we might expect little change in the world. Perhaps it does not reflect negatively or positively
on an individual who fails to accomplish the near impossible ———- which the president’s job is looking more and more like. However, if he does well, he will have accomplished the
near impossible and would therefore deserve much p’raise and thanks. ' ' . ‘ ' . .

Bush does not fit into either of these categories, sincehe was not simply a “do nothing” president. Rather, he ignored the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, aided the growth
of xenophobia and religious intolerance and began the prolonged war in Iraq. ' ' ~ '

In this way, the exculpatory promise we issue to Obama is not a double standard. It is the selfsame standard by which we’ve judged Bush as one of the worst presidents in
recent —— and perhaps not—so—recent — history. a ' l ' "

Courtesy Prince in Public

Prince in Public, Pitt's answer to 5OHl3 and other electro-inﬂuenced pop punk groups, is aiming  with its entry into a contest to win an opening slot on the Rockstar Taste
of Chaos tour. Top left, from left: Josh Siva, Gary Crow, Eric Neugebaur and Rob Hackett.

by Sarah Simkin
Staﬁ’ Wrder

Most musicians would walk .

away from a failed performance
empty-handed and disheartened.
Not'Prince In Public.

The band went into last year’s
Battle of the Bands — a competi-
tion for being the opening band at
Pitt Program Council’s Fall Fest ——
as a two-person electronic group.
But the duo experienced technical

difficulties and failed to land the

opening spot, allowing them some
time to regroup. Only a semester
later, Prince in Public has emerged
as a four-person pop band.

Pitt sophomores Gary Crow
of Lancaster, Pa., and Josh Siva of
Buffalo, N.Y., met in 2007 while
living in Litchﬁeld Tower B as
freshmen. The duo began writing
minimalist electronic, music, and
released a single, “Euro Girl,” on
iTunes.

Rob Hackett of Pittsburgh’s

suburban North Hills, also cur?

rently a Pitt sophomore, was un-
deterred by Crow and Siva’s smok-
ing speakers and lack of vocals at
the Battle of the Bands. He felt
they had potential to be a full band

and contacted them to see if they _

would be interested in collaborat-
ing. '

They were, and soon Crow,
Siva, Hackett and Eric Neugebaur,
a high—school friend of Hackett’s
and a Duquesne sophomore, were
a four—piece band.

“You could call it popppunk or
power pop,” said Siva, Prince In
Public’s guitarist and keyboardist.
“We want something that people
can hear and smile about, as well
as jump around and get into it.”

Crow is the lead singer, Hack-
ett plays ‘bass, and Neugebaur
plays drums.

Each of the band members
comes from a different musical
background, from indie to metal,
 them widespread variety.

“Every song is a little different.
The new sound is just awesome,
I’m really happy with it,” said
Neugebaur. ,

The sound wasn’t the only thing
that changed from the band’s ori-
gin to- its current incarnation. The
band’s original name, Port Author-
ity, though able to capitalize on the
free advertising on every public
transit vehicle, was not going to

work for serious purposes.

“Every name we were com-
ing up with was more ridiculous
than the last. Eventually it sort of
evolved out of free association
with a bunch of friends one night,
luck of the draw,” said Crow.

Since then, the Internet has
enabled Prince In Public to pro-
moteitself far beyond traditional
means.

 

We want something that
people can hear and smile
about, as well as jump around
and get into.



“That’s why. I love technology.
We could not,have done it with-
out MySpace,” said Hackett. The
band’s MySpace page receives tens
of thousands of views ‘weekly
and has attracted fans all over the
country and internationally.

Now, Prince In Public is hit-
ting the stage- The band is cur-

 

rently participating in the Ernie

Ball Music Man/ Vans Warped
Tour competition on www.Bat—

tleOfTheBands.com. Unsigned

. bands self-register for the contest
and upload their music, compet- -

ing to generate the most “buzz
factor,” or fan support, which is

I measured by daily voting and page

views. Of the top 20 bands‘ with
the most buzz factor, judges will
choose one winner from each of
44 cities to perform in the 2009
Rockstar Taste of Chaos tour.

The band is competing to play
in Cleveland, Ohio, Rochester,
N.Y. and Baltimore, Md.

“Finishingin the top would.

be a milestone on its own, not to
mention a chance to play at the

next level-,” said Siva. “We have a-

grassroots campaign going to get
friends and family to register and
vote. It’s a very simple process.”
Pittsburgh’s music scene can be
as dismal as its weather in terms

of opportunities for bands. Nev-

ertheless the band has played sev-
eral smaller venues and continues
to book shows ‘for the spring and
summer, and hopes to play at Pitt’s
Bigelow Bash. I '

“The most important thing is
to establish a solid base in Pitts-
burgh, right now our fans are scat-
tered nationally,” said Neugebaur.

Prince In Public is currently
recording its debut EP in studios
at Duquesne University. Within
four to six weeks its music will be
available on iTunes, Amazon, Best

Buy and several other major music

retailers.

“If we aren’t physically playing, ,

everything we do has to do with
the music or promotion,” said
Neugebaur. A .

It’s a ﬁne balance to strike for
a band as devoted to its music as
Prince in Public.

“\We understand our limits as
students with what we can and

can’t do. We want to do both _

worlds, to be successful as mu-
sicians without failing out of
school,” said Neugebaur.

The band intendsto stay in_

school, but would consider taking
time off if a big enough opportu-
nity presented itself. They hope to
tour the east coast over the sum-
mer. Siva said, ‘‘We’ll go as far as
our wheels and expense accounts

will take us.” ~

Rourke brilliantly returns

January 26, 2009.

to the screen as bruiser

by Kieran Layton
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Wrestler

Starring Mickey Rourke, Marisa
Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood
Director: Darren Aronofsky
Fox Searchlight

 

Immediate '

  
 

Don’t call it anything less than a comeback.

Unlike the new Guns N’ Roses CD that came
out a few months ago, Mickey Rourke, in one of
the best performances of the year, proves that
his talenfwas not left back in the 19805.

In ‘The Wrestler,” directed by “Requiem for
a Dream” auteur Darren Aronofsky, the actor
who everyone thought faded into obscurity after
years passed without a major role, regains rel-
evance in a  way. In what could be construed
as an eerie parallel to his own career, Rourke
ignites the screen as a fading pro wrestler who
refuses to be extinguished without one last, great
spark . M A
The ﬁlm opens with credits that double as a

primer on the superstar history of Randy ‘The

Ram” Robinson (Rourke). Through newspaper

. clippings and an exaggerated commentator in

the background, the audience grasps that this
guy  a big deal. . .

The contrast comes fast and ﬁitiously,
though, when Randy is seen as he is today ——
playing shows to a meager yet dedicated fan base
inismall New Jersey ﬁre halls. Though The Ram
is never actually witnessed in his state of glory,
it is instantly sensed how he exists as merely a
shadow of his former self.

The ﬁlm follows Randy both in narrative and
literally, through the many  shots that
keep his massive ﬁame always facing away from
us, but always front and center. He is seen strug-
gling with money and has no real relationships in

his life. There is the  stripper (Tomei) with

whom he wishes he could connect, and some-

thing about an estranged daughter  is
gradually revealed ‘

The ﬁlm doesn’t bother itself with compli-
cated plot developments or convoluted narra-
tion '— there is a wrestling match that Randy
sees as a comeback opportunity, but after a heart
mack almost kills him, the only thing Randy
loves and truly knows is stripped from him, leav-
ing him with nothing but his own misery.

The ﬁlm, like many of Aronofsky’s, is bleak,
brutally honest and rarely optimistic The audi-
ence watches, for the most part, the propelled
destruction of a human being. The irony dou-
bles as the human happens to be one who rev-
eled in a destructive sport that really isn’t a sport
at all.

I Of course, the movie often suggests other-
wise. Wrestling scenes areviolent, and no mat-
ter how much you try to convince yourself that
it is all for show, the goriness and outcomes of
ﬁghts are reminders that real  is involved,
with sometimes deadly consequences.

Much of the hype surrounding the movie

stems directly from Rourke’s performance, and

none of it is exaggerated. ‘

Besides being one of the most physically
demanding roles of the year, Rourke embodies
every nook and cranny of human misery and
struggle through his expressions, intonations
and gestures over the course of the ﬁlm.

One scene ﬁnds Randy  to re—establish‘

a connection with his estranged daughter on an
abandoned pier, and he "explains to her why he
left her and how he has failed as a father. Though
it could easily have crossed the line to 
sentimentality, the large and  Rourke
grounds it in honest and raw emotion, and he

turns it into one of the most touching scenes of ‘

the past year.

The supporting cast only adds quality. Marisa
Tomei graces the stripper pole with more sexi-
ness and ﬁnesse than women half her age, and
she should be commended for having the tenac-
ity to prove that women over 40 can pull off

extended nude scenes Evan Rachel Wood, de—,
spite her short screen time, plays the estranged

daughter role as well as anyone could. _
If there is one drawback, it is that the ﬁlm
seems to meander from scene to scene in its

micldle section While never becoming dull for

E a singie second, some   would have
made the emotional impact on the audience I

much stronger.
Let’s cross our ﬁngers that Rourke doesn’t
stayaway from the screen  for so long.

Pitt routs West Virginia,wins Brawl

Pitt realizes

importance
of Young

MORGANTOWN, W Va. _
With 12:18 left in the second half
of Pitt’s showdown against West
Virginia yesterday, Panthers coach
Jamie Dixon pulled star center De-
Juan Blair out for a breather.

Only two minutes later, point
guard Levance Fields left the court

as well. Two—thirds of Pitt’s “Big °
Three” watched from the bench,

while the Panthers clung to a single-
digit lead in the Backyard Brawl.
No matter. Yesterday at around
5:30 p.m., the Sam Young Show
started. And it lasted through the
end of Pitt’s 79-67 victory over the
Mountaineers. .
Young had eight points during
the crucial 13-3 run that knocked

to six points, Young exploded for

Pitt point guard Levance Fields.
“[\X/est Virginia] has ‘the tall play-

Big East run

by Jasmine Hawkins
. Staﬂ Writer

\V1th 0.4 seconds remaining in
Pitt’s game against Syracuse on Sat-
urday, senior Xenia Stewart released
the game—winning jumper for the
Panthers in their 77-75 win over
conference rival Syracuse.

“I think that’s what you live for as
coaches and players,” said Pitt coach
Agnus Berenato. “Everyone visual-
izes the win at the buzzer. It doesn’t
get much better  that.”

The Orange trailed most of the
game, but a 3-pointer by Syracuse’s
Erica Morrow and a layup by Chan-
drea Jones tied the game with 19.7

4 seconds on the clock.

Pitt called a timeout with 8.6

seconds in the game, and Syracuse 7

players collapsed on Shavonte Zel-
lous when play resumed, ‘leaving
Stewart open on the right  to
pull up and hit the buzzer—beating
shot. Zellous assisted the shot and
ended with 15 points and 6 assists
overall Stewart had 11 points for
the night

 off to a shaky start
against Big East competition, Pitt
regrouped and recovered. Including
the win over Syracuse, the Panthers

are on a three game  streak,

A 14-4 overall and 4-2 in the Big East

.“After the loss,we hadaweek off
and we were able to recover,” said
Berenato. “My staff puts together

an excellent game plan, and the team
is doing a tremendous job.”

Currently, No. 25—ranked Pitt is
tied with Notre Dame for fourth
in the Big East According to Be-
renato, there’s no need to be con-
cerned with the team’s losses.

“I think the team was getting
complacent, but a setback allows
you to show your true colors,” said
Berenato. “It’s not about what hap-
pens to you, but how you respond is
what matters.” .

After the win over South Flori-
da, the team had three tough away
games‘ lined up. \X/ith one road
game left, the team proved it can
compete.

“A three-game road trip is hard,”

boosts Panthers in conference standings

said Berenato. “Our players now
know that every game is important,
and we’re two—thirds of the way
there.”

Being in the Big East, Pitt can’t
get too comfortable.

~ “There is no conference like the
Big East,” said Berenato. “We have a
tough road ahead.”

Pitt will face Georgetown on the
road this Tuesday, then play home
games against Marquette and Notre
Dame.

Berenato said that planning and
execution will be the most important

'  for Pitt the rest of the way.

“All of our focus is on George-

- town, and we’re  to stick to the

game plan,” she said.

Second half propels Panthers

January 26, 2009

Pitt forward Sam Young went 9 for 14 from the ﬁeld and knocked down all four of his free throws during
yesterday's win. The Panthers as a team shot better than 55 percent for the day.

onto the lead.

With 10 minutes to go injthe
ﬁrst half, Fields tied the game for
the ﬁfth time with a layup and was
fouled‘ by West Virginia’s Alex
Ruoff in the process. The scoring
went back and forth again for the
majority of the half. Nasir Rob-
inson, Blair and West Virginia’s
Devin Ebanks each scored two in
the ﬁnal minutes of the half, leav-
ing the score with Pitt up, 39-37
at the break.

Young picked up his third foul

just a few seconds into the sec-
ond half, and Butler began the
scoring with an early 3-pointer
that gave the Mountaineers the

‘lead back. But two Blair layups

in the next minute of action gave
Pitt the edge again 43-40. When
Young came back off the bench
a few minutes later, Pitt was ready
to put the game away.

Young’s 16 points helped the
Panthers put together several

the spirit out of West  and
its loyal crowd. When Blair exited,
_ Pitt led 55-50. By the time Dixon
J threw him back in, Pitt was up -71-
58. t
Mountaineers coach Bob Hug-
gins admitted that Young beat his
team.
__ “He’s a great player, and he’s
’ been doing that for a long time,”
said Huggins. “We gave Sam some
open looks, and he made them.”
Yesterday’s Victory showed
just how important Young is to
.__the Panthers. Although Blair and
Fields possess their own unique
qualities that entertain the audi-
ence, Young is the character who

carries the show.
Just last week, Young was cn'ti—

cized for his inability to drive to the ‘

basket and his reliance on 3-point-
ers. He went through a three-game
stretch in which he made only 15-
of—49 shots, and seven of those
were from beyond the arc. Dur-
ing Pitt’s only loss of the season
last Saturday to Louisville, Young
hoisted 10 3—pointers and made
tWO.

It looks like that phase is over.

“I felt like a couple games in the
past I took too many threes,” said
Young. “It’s uncharacteristic of me
to take too many. I’m not [David-
son guard] Stephen Curry or any:

body like that I have too many di- I

mensions in my game to be relying
on the three that much.”

Those dimensions were on
display at the WVU Coliseum yes-
terday. Young attacked the basket
repeatedly, either dunking in full
force or drawing contact; He made
all four of his free throws as well.

Dixon reiterated just what
Young brings to Pitt’s story.

“He’s going to be an NBA ﬁrst—
round piclg and this is a guy that
was pretty much underrecruited
coming out of high school,” said
Dixon. “He’s a great example of a
kid that, even for our own players
right now or future players, we can

talk about a kid who has worked.
And we can show our newcomers
or freshmen that this guy has come
from where he was to where he is
now because he’s the hardest work-
ing guy in the gym.”

Blair is a legitimatemonster in
the paint, and Fields holds his own
as one of the countryfs top point
guards and playmakers. But Pitt
hasn’t shown it can beat a top-ﬂight
Big East opponent when Young
has an off game.

The Panthers knocked off St.
John’s and South Florida when
Young wasn’t his normal self, but
Pitt’s luck ran out when he strug-
gled from the ﬁeld against Louis-

ond half.

Dixon went 3-of—5 from be-
hind the arc and scored 11 points
in 32 minutes of action.

Guard Alex Ruoff, the only
senior on West Virginia’s roster,
scored 16 in the contest.

Blair ended with his 13th
double—double of the season,
scoring 16 points and adding 11
rebounds.

Pitt (1 8-1, 6-1) plays again on
Wednesday when it travels to Vil-
lanova for a 7 p.m. matchup.

dominant

ville.

It looked like Pitt might suffer
the same fate when Young picked
up his third foul only seven seconds
into the second half, and Dixon sat
him for ﬁve minutes. West Virginia
led 45-43 when Young came back
in, and Pitt outscored the Moun-
taineers 36-22 the rest of the way.

Young’s second-half effort as-
sured that his slump is behind

‘ pretty much can tell when
I’m in a groove from practice,” said
Young. “When my practices are
good, my games are usually good?’

News" that’s sure to keep Pitt’s
audience happy.

Gymnastios

by Laura Veith
For T be Pitt New

The Pitt gymnastics team made the
short travel ‘to conference rival West Vir-
ginia on Friday night, hoping to claim its
ﬁrstwin of the season.

With a small lead of 0.3 going into
the ﬁnal rotation, the Panthers took to
the beam. But costly wobbles caused a
194.775-192.700 Mountaineer win.

“The girls tried so hard to hang on,”

said Pitt coach Yohman after the meet, V

“They weren’t going to fall off that beam.
They did so well, but we just have to work
on the small things.”
Despite the loss, the women showed
‘improvement with seven gymnasts scoring
personal highs and two team season—high
scores on both the beam and vault. -

In the opening rotation, co-captains‘

I.‘-‘0.I‘a. I I .

We have coverage designedespecially for Pitt students.

Alix Croop and Dani Bryan set personal
highs on. the bars. Tying her career high,
Croop tallied a 9.825 for second. place,
while Bryan scored a 9.675 —— also a sea-
son high.

The Panthers ﬁnished off the vault with
a season—high score of 49.125, as Bryan led
all with a 9.900. Teammates Molly Moyer
and Alicia Talucci followed closely behind
with scores of 9.825 and 9.850.’ Senior

Pitt gymnastics wobbles to Brawl loss

Anya Chayka ﬁnished with a 9.800, tying
her career high. '

Taking to the ﬂoor for the third rota-
tion, the Panthers posted a season—high
mark of 49.00. Once again, Bryan led the
way with a career high 9.875 and a second
overall standing. _

‘Croop and Shannon McConnel also set
season—high scores. Croop added a 9.850
and McConnel followed with a 9.800, giv-
ing the Panthers a 0.3 point advantage go-
ing into the ﬁnal -rotation. .

Yet problems on the beam and a strong
ﬁnal rotation for the Mountaineers led to
the Panther loss.

“They were just nervous -out there,”
said Pitt coach Debbie Yohman. “But we
showed near championship caliber.”

I Bryan said that even though Pitt is still
winless, the team morale hasn’t been af-
fected.

.‘‘We set the bar really high this season,”
she said. “We have all the skills and talent
to win the [conference], we just" have to
work on consistency and we can do it.”

The Panthers will host North Carolina
State on Sunday at Fitzgerald Field House
at 1 p.m.
