THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1950

Program
Here Set

By BOB LEWIS

The University will be second
to no Pittsburgh institution this
year in the celebration of Penn-

’ sylvania Week, Oct. 1622.
J Pitt’s local committee has
arranged for classroom speeches,
sound films, and the distribution

literature about Pennsylvania's
history and industry. Throughout
the week, Pittsburghers will see-
the State flag flying below the
United States standard on the
flag pole between the Heinz Chapel
and the Cathedral.
Open House
Highlighting Pitt's contribution
-to the annual celebration will be
the University’s Open House on
Sunday, Oct. 22, from 2 to 6 p.m.
While exhibits are in progress
all over the campus, the Commons
Room will be the center of the re-
ception. Chancellor and Mrs. Rufus
H. Fitzgerald will welcome visitors
there, and student and faculty aides
will be on hand to direct strangers
and answer questions. i

The annual Open House is parti-
cularly designed to give students a
chance to bring their parents to
meet University officials and fa-
culty and visit the campus build-
ings.

This year’s
friendship

demonstration of
to Pittsburgh and the
state promises to be even a greater
success than last year’s Open
House. In addition to opening most
of the Cathedral's classrooms, lab-
oratories, and libraries for inspec-
tion, many of the Upper Campus
buildings will be open.

University buses will provide
transportation from the Fifth Ave-
nue entrance of the Cathedral to
other Pitt buildings every 20 min-
utes.

Many Exhibits

Various exhibits have been plan-
ned to appeal to all tastes of the
University’s guests. Scientifically
inclined alumni and friends, for
instance, can see the electron
microscope or biophysics lab in
Thaw Hall. In the Cathedral, Room
G-8, the physics department will
put on a demonstration, and the
biology department will have an
exhibit of plant and animal physi-
ology on the ninth floor.

An atom bomb show, including a
talk and motion picture every half
hour, will also share the ninth floor
with a display of new researches and
products in citrus fruits.

cil Vote:

44 Ayes Against 4 Nays »

By TIM KOVAR

Men’s Council's program to

put a dink on every freshman

head has received valuable support from a vital source--- Fresh-

man Council.

At its first meeting held in 817 C1. on Thursday 44 of the 50
frosh representatives voted to continue the dink program. When
the 50 members of the council were polled in a straw vote, the

results tallied as follows:

For continuance of the dink pro-
gram: 44.
Against: 4
Abstaining: 1

Heated Discussion
Prior to the vote, a heated dis-
cussion arose between the veterans
and the younger set of freshman
about continuing the dink program.

The split between the two factions
was evident from the start when
Men’s Council Representative Len
Baker called for comment on the
subject.

The vets, protesting loudly against
the set-up, made such remarks as
"silly’_’ and "beneath our dignity’.’
Dinks were conspicuously absent
from the heads of the veterans but
it was later discovered that the

The Freshman Council, set up
for the purpose of acting as a repre-

sentative group where freshman

Plot Plans

he lnterfraternity Advisors
Council will hold it's first meeting
of the year tonight at the Phi Delt
house, 225 N. Dithridge St.

A dinner and talk fest on foot-
ball will be held from 6:00 to 7:30
p.m. with Captain Tom Hamilton as
the speaker.

Joe Seidlars, Phi Delt host, will
preside at the business meeting
from 7:30 to about 8:30. There is
no regular order of business except
organizational plans and proposals.

The Interfraternity Advisors
Council was very strong before the
war and came back last year, but
they have not yet been formally re-
organized.

Their purpose is to discuss prob-
lems, such as finances, rushing,
and other affairs and then advise
IF Council of their views.

lnterfraternity Advisers Council
is made up of an alumni and a fac-
ulty advisor from each’: fraternity.
Officers have not yet been elected
and Lester Braily, assistant dean
of men,is acting as temporary chair-
man and secretary.

Some of the proposed plans in-
clude a possible "fraternity row,”
to be constructed near Pitt in the
close future.

WASHINGTON, D. C.. Oct. 17 - As thousands of young medical men
went to register for the draft yesterday, selective service Chief Lewis
B. Hershey warned that many men now deferred from the draft will be
called up next, and that he may soon ask for the elimination of all de-
pendency deferments except for fathers. Even some fathers may have to
be called, if other categories fail to supply enough men, he predicted.

‘Korea Today’ Topic

For Journalist ’s Lecture

Mrs. lnduk Pahk, Korean lecturer and journalist, will speak in
Stephen Fostertiemorial tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. on
At present Mrs. Pahk is a Voice of America commentator. This
position may endanger members of her family still living there but
as she puts it “It is a matter of conviction. Besides, if we were

all afraid, who would fight?”

During the American occupation
in Korea, Mrs. Pahk worked as a
radio lecturer with ‘the Military Gov-
ernment in the department of public
information. She is also the author
of several books and has written for
Korean newspapers.

Commenting on the Korean situa-
tion she said "South Koreans are
good fighters. Give them the weapons
and you Americans will not be dis-
appointed. Southerners as a rule use
their brains. Northerners use their
brawn. But as always, in the long
run, brain must conquer brawn.”

Mrs. Pahk did her undergraduate
work in Korea and at Wesleyan Col-
lege, and received her M.A. degree
from Teachers’ College, Columbia
University.

Mrs. Pahk was born in Chinnampo,
Korea, which is north of the 38th
parallel.

Her lectures at colleges through-

out the country are sponsored by
the East and West Association.

from that standpoint, in that almost
every man present had something to
say about the controversial orienta-
tion program.

“Not Training”

The main argument for the vet-
eran group stemmed from the idea
that "they were at college to get an
education and didn't see where the
‘wearing of the dink figured in that
training.” -

One vet voiced the opinion that
it was “below our dignity” to wear
a silly dink. They were of the opin-
ion that men over 21 and married
men should be exempt from the
rule.

On the other hand, thejust-out-of
school faction believed that while
not a necessity, the dinks did have
an "important place in college
life.” They believed that the dink
was a small enough contribution to
school spirit and that "the veter-
ans should be able to go along with
the idea since it is only required
for six weeks.”

President Satisfied
MC president Roy Titchworth sat
in on the meeting and commented,
“Since Pitt is a street-car College
with no definite campus life, the
dink is a small enough thing to con-
tribute to a freshman’s pride in his
university.”
When asked if he did not think
the dink was merely a good way for
the upperclassmen to identify the
“freshies,” Titchworth replied,
“The‘dink is a symbol that you are
a member of the freshman class at
the University of Pittsburgh."
Further discussion was cut short
for lack of time.

Eight Dinkless Frosh Ha uled

Before Upper

Eight freshman were brought

Class Court

before the first meeting of the

Upper Class Court because they didn't wear their dinks.

Of these eight offenders, three
said they lost their dinks, and the
other five offered no excuses. The
five were warned that if a second
offense occurs, disciplinary action
will be taken.

Norton Berman, vice president of
Men’s Council and co-chairman of

its customs and traditions committee, '

said, "Now that the Court is com-
pletely functioning, all freshman
violators will be brought before the
Court for trial and appropriate action
will be taken.”

'-° Members of upper class patrol
will report offenders to the dean of
Men’s office, and the offenders will
be notified by mail and ordered to

appear before the Court.

  Fee for Withdrawing

Goes Up 100 per cent

The cost of dropping a course
in these inﬂated times, gone up.

at Pitt has, like everything else

The Treasurer’s Office has made public a new schedule of
charges to students who withdraw or drop a course during a sem-
ester which shows rates that are in some cases double those pre-

viousl y in effect.

Under the new schedule, students
who drop a regular sixteen-week
course after attending for one week
Or less will be charged 20 percent
of tuition. They used to pay only
10 percent.

Gets Higher
A charge of 100 percent of tuition

is the rate now in effect if the period

of attendance is five weeks or longer.
Previously, this rate applied only
to those who attended a course for
a period of eight weeks or more.

The new schedule was adopted at
the recommendation of the Veterans
Administration. Its purpose is to
bring the rates at Pitt closer to the
level of those in effect at mo st other
universities.

Roy W. Henley, veterans accoun-
tant, said, however, that although
the new rates are considerably
steeper than the old ones; they are
still among the most liberal in the
country.

, Draftees Exempt

He said also that they apply to
everyone, veteran and non-veteran
alike, with one major exception.

Any student who is called to ac-
tive duty with the armed services
will be charged on a pro rata basis.
That is,ifhe has attended one week
of a‘ sixteen-week course the with-
drawal charge will be one sixteenth
of his tuition. This is the same rate
that prevailed before the change.

All seniors graduating from the

College are required to take the

Graduate Record Examinations, Dr. George L. Fahey, director of
the University Testing Service, announced today.
For students who expect to graduate in Feb.,, 1951, these tests

will be given on Nov. 14 and 16 from

1 to 5 p.m. and Nov. 17 from 1 to
3 p.m.

lGraduate Nurse

February graduates will receive Wins Fgllowghip

letters concerning appointment time
and place.

Seniors graduating in June will
be given the test in April, and Sept-
ember graduates will be tested in
July.

The examination consists of eight
tests of general knowledge, which
include mathematics, physical sci-
ence, social studies,literature, arts.
vocabulary, and effectiveness of
expression.

In addition to this for a majority
of students there is an advanced
test in their major fields.

Ac cording to Dr. Fahey, there
are three reasons why this test is
given.

It aids the University in self
evaluation incomparision with other
colleges.

From the standpoint of the stu-
dent, it gives him an appraisal of
his own academic attainment, and
is also of use to students interested
in graudate study. Many graduate
schools require the results of this
examination for admission.

Sophomores are no longer re-
quired to take the exam. '

Copies of the University Social
Calender are available free of charge

nity events,mixer dances, receptions
and other socials, as well as football
games, up to Dec. 23.

Inasmuch as the calender repre-
sents an outlay of $70 by Congress’
Publicity Committee, Carothers said
that ‘he is interested in student's
reaction to it. He said that anyone
who wants to express his opinion
on it may do so via the Student Con-
gress suggestion boxes, the loca-
tions of which are to be announced

The following exerpts are quoted
from the Selective Service Opera-

sued to all local draft boards:

“...college- students, other than
_students of healing arts..., local
boards may consider the following
conditions when all three exist in
the case of any registrant as war-
ranting consideration for occupa-
tional deferment:

1. The registrant has completed

at least one academic year of
a full-time course of instruc-

tion at a college, university.

ing.

The college or university at
which the registrant last com-
pleted an academic year of a
full-time course of instruction
certifies that the registrant's
scholastic standing placed
him among the upper half of
his class.

The local board is satisfied
by the record of the regi-

THE PITT NEWS - Tuesday, October 17, 1950 -- Page 4

Send the Band

It is a journalistic tradition that a newspaper develops an
editorial policy on institutions and issues. In this editorial we

wish to express our opinion on the Pitt Varsity Band. We’re for
it. We think it is a pretty darn good band.

The issue is whether or not the band should go to the Notre
Dame game. Again we are for the band. We think it should go.

We'd like to let the people out in Indiana get a good look at
our band. We’d also like to let the millions of television set
owners in the nation see our band. There are an estimated eight
million TV sets in the country. Of this a large number will un-
doubtedly be watching the Panther clash with the Irish. Seeing
the band on TV will let a great many people understand why we
are so proud of the band. ‘It will convince a lot‘ of doubters that
that our boasting is not idle.

Conservative estimates place the number of Pitt supporters
who will be in the stands at South Bend at four thousand. "Of this
number, two thousand will go on three special trains. The rest
will get there by plane, train and auto. Back here, in Pittsburgh,
there will be roughly two hundred thousand fans and students
rooting for the Panther on TV. This will make the Pitt-Irish game
the largest in spectator-student attendance this year. _'It will be as
if a gigantic stadium had been built and two hundred thousand
fans had crushed their way in.

Saturday’s performance by the band is sufficient argument that

it will bring credit to the University.

The chief obstacle to the band’s attendance at the game is-

2500 dollars. The band like all other departments, has been af-
fected by the reduced University budget. It is clear, therefore,
that the money, must come from an outside source, or from the
students themselves.

We have figured that it would cost each student about 50
cents a head. But voluntary contributions, while they are admir-
able are rather uncertain.

A better way would be for the leading student organizations
on the campus to get together and organize some kind of drive
that will net 2500 dollars. Student Congress, Men’s Council,
WSGA and IF Council are the logical leaders for such a drive.

We hope that they, like the NEWS, will take the hint and fol-
low student opinion.

Send the band to Notre Dame!

Frosh Vote

The overwhelming 44 to 4 vote endorsement of Men’s Coun-
cil.’s freshman program by the newly organized Freshman Coun-
cil is important in that it is the first time Frosh have been able
to register their opinion on something which directly_ affects them.
They now have a sounding board for their own particular problems.

The overwhelming approval of the dinks comes as a surprise
to many juniors and seniors who didn’t have to wear them in their
first year here. It has been a common belief that Frosh were
generally not in favor of Men’s Council’s addition to their ward-
robe. The frosh themselves have now effectively exploded that
theory.

Since the Freshman Council is an offspring of Men’s Council
it will be interesting to note the amount of freedom they give their
child. We hope they are tolerant parents.

Chest Drive

In approximately three weeks Pitt students will be asked to
throw their dimes and dollars into the till for‘ the 1950 Pitt Chest
Drive. Beneﬁting will be 100 and 1 organizations, some directly
connected with the University, others not. Stock the Chest full
this year-. Bear in mind last year's fund drive which ended $2400
shy of its goal.

Flashbacks

Twenty years ago the student
body at Pitt published a weekly
newspaper. As the university
was not as wealthy then as it
is now, the price charged for
the Pitt Weekly was five cents.
Here are a few items culled
from the Weekly to highlight
the Pitt of twenty years ago.

John Weber, business mana-
ger of the university, reported
that the bookstore would lose
$1100 because they had cut the
price of theme paper a nickel a

showed a profit for the whole
year of $61.

Editor,
Pitt News

It is inspiring to be able to recog-
nize and welcome our new Freshmen
and the "dinks” are attractive as
well as identifying. However,I
wonder if we are being quite fair
to our new students to encourage
the wearing of caps at all times

in elevators and in the presence of
ladies.
What do you think about this?

Dorothy Rood
Chairman, Department of Public
Health Nursing

Those big horses from Texas certainly didn’t act coltish
Saturday afternoon in the Stadium. Very businesslike, in fact.
Too bad we couldn’t accomplish the mane objective and give

Rice a really good currying.

, By the way, if Texas is the land blessed by ‘God where the
sun shines like the Texans claim, how come they got themselves

an Owl for a mascot.

Rice’s theme song is sung to the
tune of that piece about somebody’s
golden anniversary. After his boys
got off to a 7-0 lead, only to lose
the game and Bill Sichko, one of
the best of the Panther halfbacks,
Casanova probably doesn’t care if
he doesn’t see those boys from
Texas again for another 50 years.

Owl ls lll Omen

Chalk the loss up to a hangover
of bad luck from Friday the thir-
teenth if you're superstitious.
That’s when news that three more
Panthers were on their way to the
Marines became public. The cry is
“The Marines Have Landed.” It's
been changed to “Don helmets,com-
rades, and hold that line. Here
Comes the Pitt backfield.”

Father Tom O’Connor, the guest
speaker, was ribbing Casanova at
the Newman Club communion break-
fast Sunday morning.

He told a story about three par-
ochial high schools whose district
limits overlap. Seems the three
coaches were all anxious to recruit
the stars of a championship grade
school team. After a talk with the

2 nun in charge, one coach offered

the kids free tuition ($5 a month);
the second offered tuition and

books; the third, tuition, books, and
carfare.

Milkshake Subsidy

If Casanova agreed to subsidize
each boy with a weekly milkshake,
the priest said he would guarantee
the coach would get the cream of
thegrade school crop in his district.

Five years is a lot of milkshakes,
but if the Marines keep raiding, Cas
could do well to consider the pro-
position.

The cheering from the high school
section Saturday was enthusiastic.
But Jack Baker, head cheerleader,
probably isn’t feeling as charitable
as he might toward the younger fry.
Somebody beaned him with either
an apple or a hot chocolate can, he
doesn’t know which. He staggered
around for several minutes before
his head cleared.

For once he was sorry the 1'6‘
spouse from the stands was stunning,
I guess.

New Kiss Definition

Did you hear about the biology
lab assistant who stoutly maintains
that a kiss is just an anatomical
juxtaposition of the obiscular
muscles? Tch, Tchl Or more ap-
propriate, if not as phonetic, Tusk,
Tusk! What an ivory tower he’s
been living in!

Ground Broken For Nurses
Home In Medical Center

Ground was broken Oct. 12 for Pitt’s new multi-million dollar
Nurses’ Home, which will house 650 student nurses. The building
will require two years’ construction before completion.

In June, 1948, a group of Pittsburgh civic leaders were told of
Pitt’s giant building program. Thirteen months later, Alan Scaife,

chairman of the University’s Build-
ing Fund Campaign, reported that
$7,334,240 had been raised toward
the $12,700,000 goal.

At that time the plans called for
eight new buildings. In the Medical
Center the school plans to build a
new School of Medicine Building,
a Clinical Wards and Clinical Lab-
oratories Wing and the Nurses Home.
Total cost for these three buildings
alone came to a little over

$10,000,000.

FRONTIER LIFE -- Two students look over part of the Darlington

Room’s Open House display.

Proclamations by Gov. John Penn offer

gold bounties for Indian scalps and refute Virginia's claim to Western
Pennsylvania. All documents are originals, not copies.

()-H Exhibit Tells Tale;
Blood, Gold, Politics

The public will get a glimpse of blood, Spanish gold and co-
lonial politics in a Darlington Library open house exhibit of rare
documents from early Pennsylvania history.

One of the items, a Proclamation by the lieutenant governor,
which will be on view from 2 to 6 p.m. Sunday, dates back to 175C.

It offers 150 pieces of gold for
every Indian over 12 years old
taken prisoner.

For a warrior’s SCa.1P, and for
every female squaw and every boy
taken prisoner, the reward was 130
pieces of gold. The scalp of a fe-
male or apboy was worth 50 pieces
of gold.

The display will feature very
rare and valuable letters, manu-
.scripts, maps,’ magazines, also
newspapers, and printed histories
of early Pennsylvania.

Among the letters are one’ by Mad
Anthony Wayne, an account of trade
dealings with the Indian Capt.
White Eyes by George Croghan,
letters by Hugh Henry Breckenridge,

Service to Pennsylvania is a year round program for the Insti-
tute of Local Government, located here in the Cathedral. Directed
by Dr. Elmer D. Graper, head of the Political Science department,
this six year old organization has expanded rapidly both in acti-

vitie s and fame.

Since 1947, the Institute has engaged in a threefold program,
including formal classes in the Political Science department, re-

the founder of the University of
Pittsburgh, and many others.

In addition to the above men-
tioned,twhe collection contains some
of the finest and rarest of the early
Pennsylvanian Indian treaties
printed by Franklin.

“The most interesting item in the
exhibit to me,” says Mrs. Lois
Mulkearn, "is the counter-procla-
mation of John Penn against Vir-
ginia’s claim for the land around
Pittsburgh. The Proclamation men-
tions the Quebec Act of 1774 in
which the British government ex-
presses the provinces of Quebec
and Canada to be bounded by the
northern and western boundaries of
Pennsylvania.”

Historian

Park and State

By GEORGE BARBOUR

Without historians like Dr. John W. Oliver, head of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s history department , there would be little
basis for celebrating a Pennsylvania Week. .

For five years, starting in 1931, Dr. Oliver was chairman of

an extensive program,

Survey. It was sponsored by the
Historical Society of Western Penn-
sylvania, the University of Pitts-
burgh, and the Buhl Foundation.

To hear Dr. Oliver tell of the
project, you would think it was just
an overnight assignment. But the
survey was a momentous job.

From the information gathered,
ten books were published. The sub-
jects ranged through the economic,
political, and social aspects of
pioneer life in Western Pennsyl-
vania. Among the several authors
are Dr. Leland W. Baldwin and Dr.
Russell  Ferguson of the history
department.

At; present Dr. Oliver has two
other positions besides being on
the University's Faculty. As state-
appointed member of the Pennsyl-
vania Historical Commission, he
works to preserve Pennsylvania’s
historical heritage and to preserve

public records, historical docu-
ments, and places of historic in-
terest.

His other position is chairman of

the Western Pennsylvania Historical

the Point Park Historic commission.
With a smile, Dr. Oliver told of his
friendly tiff with the Daughters of
American Revolution concerning
historic Fort Pitt. His proposal to
raise the blockhouse to a level with
the surrounding land which has en-
gulfed it,was met with a firm “no.”

State’s Native

Art Displayed

“Pennsylvania” has been the
theme ‘for four interesting exhibits
in the Fine Arts department in the
past few years.

The first of these was an exhibit
in 1938 which featured the work of
19th century artists from Pittsburgh.

River boats, and paintings per-
taining to river life were displayed

in 1947 in a show entitled “Pitts-
burgh and its Rivers.”

Pennsylvania Dutch Art

"Pennsylvanian Folk Art” which
featured particularly the art of the
Pennsylvania Dutch was shown in
1941. In this same year “Old Pitts-
burgh” was portrayed by old prints,
drawings, paintings, glass work
and pottery. ‘

The department tries to display
the work of one 19th century reg-
ional artist each year.

Last year they showed the work
of Russell Smith. Russell Smith is
of particular interest as a document-
ary artist. He painted views of
Pittsburgh and its buildings which
have since been destroyed. Among
themlwas a painting of "Western
University of Pennsylvania,” the
old name for Pitt.

Woodwell Considered

For this years regional artist ex-
hibit, the department is considering
the work of Joseph Woodwell.Joseph
Woodwell is a nineteenth century
artist and is also the father ofMrs.
Johanna W.K. Hailman an outstand-
ing painter in Pittsburgh.

search projects, and informational
services.

Classes are offered at Pitt in
Pennsylvania Local Government,
and a Borough Officers’ Training
Course in Police, Health, Recrea-
tion, Planning, and Public Rela-
tions is given in several of Pitts-
burgh’s residential sections for in-

service training of local govern-

ment employees.
Has Own Library

With the aid of its own library,
the Institute answers an average of
76 inquiries daily, sent in from all
over the state. Besides this work,
last year it published the “Pitts-
burgh Manual,” the most complete
description of Pittsburgh govern-
ment to date. I

A new venture was begun last
winter with the formation of the
Associated Institutes of Govern-
ment of Pennsylvania Universi-
ties. Institutes are now organized
at Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania

State, and Pittsburgh, and will
share facilities, especially as
regards the research carried on

by all groups .

Grads Keep
State Healthy

Pitt graduates are doing much to
keep the state and nation’s citi-
zens healthy.

The Schools of Medicine, Den-
tistry, Nursing, and Pharmacy of
the University of Pittsburgh have
done a large share of the work
necessary to maintain modern
health standards.

The School of Pharmacy, from
its beginning as the Pittsburgh
College of Pharmacy in 1878, a
two year school, has grown to a
unit of the University with a four
year course granting the degree
of Bachelor of Science in Phar-
macy. As a member of the Public
Health Team the school gives ser-
vice to the public not only in
Pennsylvania, but "in the other
fortv-seven states.

Over the past years approxi-
mately 4,09O students have gra-
duated from the Dental School.
Eighty-five per cent of these den-
tists set up their practices in
western Pennsylvania. The infir-
mary last year treated 5,400 pa-
tients. Six hundred of these were
children.

The Schools of Nursing and
Medicine train a,large number of
Pennsylvania’s medical people.

One-tenth of all the nurses in
the United States received their
training in Pennsylvania. No other
state in the Union has more nursing
schools. So there's one chance in
ten that the next nurse that takes
your pulse learned how to do it in
the Keystone state.

11 War, Peace, Industry

Pennsylvania’s coal and steel industries, its highways and
lams, and its ore and oil are big reasons why the state is one of
he most highly developed areas in the country.

Pitt’s School of Engineering is shouldering its share of the
esponsibility for producing the technically trained/men who can
;et the most from the state’s raw materials and production.

The school’s program for gradu-
te work in industry is the first of
:s kind anywhere in the world.

Every one of the school’s depart-
ments is developing future leaders
)rV all the essential industries
'hich, make Pennsylvania great.

The head of the chemical en-
ineering department, Prof. James
Ioull, reports that the graduates of
is department are employed in all
tates of the union, but especially
1 Pennsylvania.

800 Inspectors Trained

During the war this department
rained 800 inspectors for war
roduction lines. Pittsburgh in-
ustries were almost exclusively
upervised by Pitt-trained men.

The civil engineering department
lso has its graduates spread
hroughout the city, state, and
ountry. Says Prof. R. F. Edgar,

head of the department, "Since

'18-46 the civil engineering depart-

ment has been supplying engi-
neers to this community where
they have been employed in road
building, steel designing and erec-
tion, water supply, drainage, and
city planning.”
Miners Protected

The mining engineering depart-
ment under Prof. E. A. Dines act-
ing head, graduated 25 students
this past year who are working in
and around the bituminous mines
of Pittsburgh. Forming the intel-
ligent backbone of the mining
industry in Pennsylvania, they

‘protect the health and welfare of

the state's miners.
Pitt claims the world's first
petroleum engineering school.
Started in 1912 when this state’s
wells were producing most of

the nation’s oil supply, the
school’s purpose is to develop
techniques of oil field operation.

Pennsylvania, the industrial
storehouse of the nation, offers
tremendous opportunities to the
engineering school graduate.

Duff Honors Prof

Governor James Duff recently
commissioned Prof. R. D. Gorhan,
head of the electrical engineering
department, as a member of State
Registration Board of Professional
Engineers of July 20,1950.

One of the department’s in-
structors, J. F. Pierce, was re-
leased from teaching duties for
important research on cybernetics--
study of the similarities between
an electric brain and the human
brain and the nervous system.

The department turns out 125
graduates a year. Most of these
step immediately into Penn-
sylvania's electrical industries.

War Help Cited

From the department of metal-
lurgical engineering, Prof. G. R,
Fitterer, head, cites two instances

of specific help from his depart-

“arsenal of democracy,” there was
a terrific wartime shortage of train-

ed personnel for steel companies
and the ordinance departments of
the armed forces. Twenty-two

hundred people were trained as
steel inspectors through the en-
gineering science, management war
training program at three centers

in Pittsburgh, and

Erie.

More recently, since 1942, the
department has conducted research

for the acid open-hearth steel-
producing companies peculiar to

Pennsylvania. By this process,
steel produced is given the extra

strength necessary for strenuous
service in turbines, locomotives,
and pullman cars. Carnegie-Illinois
Mesta, Blaw-Knox are only three

of the dozen or so producers of
this steel.

Pitt’s Law School is not only concerned with graduating suc-
cessful attorneys, but is engaging in several other important pub-

lic service projects. Among these
is the public health project -- the
codification and revision of the
public ‘health ordinances of Pitts-
burgh and the laws of Penn-
sylvania. A complete codification
of the city's ordinances will soon
be available to persons connected
with public health service.
Housing laws and ordinances of
the Pittsburgh metropolitan area
have also come under the survey of
the Law School. At the request of
the Allegheny Conference on Com-
mun ity Development, the Law
School has prepared an intensive

study dealing with this subject.

Historically the most significant
contribution that the Law School
has made is the fact that the large
majority of graduates live and
work in this area.

Among 2,000 Pitt Alumni are
numerous outstanding attorneys,
bar association presidents, judges
of tr.ial and appellate courts, and
l'l0l.Cl€fS Of important governmental
posts. Pitt law graduates serve
Pittsburgh business and‘ industry,
not only in terms of governmental
structure but in the economic
growth of the area.

Pennsylvania Week Section

School of Business Brings

Executives Back toSchool

The fifth session of the School of Business Administration's
course in Management Problems for Executives starts this week.

This unusual management course has developed rapidly into
a vital contribution to the industrial progress of Pennsylvania,

the nation, and the world.

As Prof. E. C. Stone, administrative practices head, puts it:
"This course in Management Problems for Executives constitutes

a new type of adult education for
men in practical life. Our objective
is to help the more capable men of
industry to develop ability to think
like able executives.”
Youngest Is 39

All students in the course are men
Of 39 or over who have worked for
anorganization long enough to reach
the department head level. Each man
has been selected by his company
officers as good executive timber,
with an inherent ability to advance.
The company's faith in these future
top policy makers is shown by the
fact that eachfirm finances its man’s
tuition for the course, as well as
his room and board for the eight
weeks session.

The course was established. in
Spring of 1949 under the sponsorship
of the Education Committee of Pitts-
burgh’s Chamber of Commerce. Mem— -
bers of this committee rank among
the most distinguished business and
educational authorities in the land.
Students live and eat together for
the course's duration.

Teachers Former Veeps
The teachers are also former man-
agers and vice-presidents with long
experience in varied fields of busi-
ness. For example, Prof. Stone has

‘been with Duquesne Light for 36

years as general manager and later
as a vice-president. He is still a
director of the firm.

Students themselves possess con-
siderable experience in varied in-
dustries, from food products to pet-
roleum. They are constantly encour-
aged to learn from each other by
freely interchanging information and
ideas.

English Still
Basic Skill

Pitt offers to the men and women
of western Pennsylvania numerous
opportunities in the field of Eng-
lish.

D11. Putnam Jones, head of the
English department, believes that
the department’s most important
contribution to Pennsylvania has
been in raising “the level of com-
petence in reading andwriting among
the young men and women of the
western part of the state.”

In addition to basic skills, Pitt
offers professional training in Eng-
lish at all educational le'vels. Four
members of the senior English staff
have themselves received training
at the University.

Many men and women are also
trained to make their living through
all phases of writing from news
reporting to poetry.

Dr. Jones reports that there is

Pitt Needs Better Luck
To Spill Northwestern

If the Pitt Panthers are to upset Northwestern at Evanston
this week, they will certainly need a change of luck. No team can
afford the bushel of bad breaks that came the Panthers’ way, as
they lost to Rice, 14-7, Saturday.

The last quarter, for example, was a period when nothing
seemed to go right for Len Casanova’s men. Four times they were
on or within the Rice 20, and once on the 29, but they failed
every time to push the ball past the goal line.

Twice Gene Silver intercepted Fred Botti’s passes in the end
zone to end Pitt threats and keep the Owls among the unbeaten

Top Panthers Twice

Pitt's cross country team met its
.match on Saturday. The previously

undefeated harriers bowed to Penn
State, 17-38, on the Schenley Park
course.

Over the wet S-mile course Penn
State's Bill Ashenfelter and Al
Porto finished in a tie for first
place with a 27:20.5 time. Bernie
Luterancik was the first Pittite to
finish with a 27:38 time.

Ken Mahanna, winner of the first
two Pitt meets, finished seventh

, with a 28:02 time. He was the sec-
, ond Panther to score.
 _ The Pitt frosh, opening their
‘schedule, dropped a 19‘/2-35}/2 meet
to the Penn State frosh. Statefs
, Don Bagby, Carl Godshall, and
'j. Bob Hollen crossed the finish line
together to give the Lions the first
1 three places. Their time was 16:57

Don DelliGati was the first Pan-

lwith a time of 17:10.

 

Delts Topple
Phi Gams

By BOB GOLLINGS

In a clash of two undefeated in-
tramural teams, Phi Delta Theta,
nosed out Phi Gamma Delta, 13-8,
Friday, to take the lead in Section
Two of the Fraternity League.

The Phi Delts moved to an early
lead, as George Harris passed them
to two touchdowns byhalftime.Com-
pleted TD passes to Jim Stopford
and Jerry Cornwell established a
13-0 lead.

The Fijis first score came as the
Phi Delts, on their own goal line,
bobbled a pass from center and let
it fall into the endzone for asafety.

Slnrtly afterward, the Phi Gams
made their only touchdown as Buz
Pinkerton snaked through the center
of the line for a 60-yard touchdown
romp.

DTD Wins

Delta Tau Delta jammed two
touchdowns together in the second
half of Thursday aftemoon’s game
to squeeze out the Phi Kaps, 19-14.

Both teams, touted as strong con-
tenders in Section 2 this year, filled
the air with passes throughout the
game, rarely attempting any running
plays.

It was the first game this year for
the DTD’s but their star was again
Kenny Thorpe, who sparked the
Delts to a second place finish last
year.

Thorpe scored two TD’s for the
victors. His first touchdown came
on a brilliant kickoff return. The
other score came on a razzle-dazzle
play with Thorpe finally taking a
lateral from Ed Truter and racing
into payland.

Phi Kap scored their first touch-
down on the first play from scrim-
mage, Tippy Gentile going over.
Then, with but a. minute to play in
the final quarter, Gentile fired a
long desperation pass to Tom Bren-
echin for the final score.

DISCARDS from

the 2 Sports Shuffle

 

RVMLLDOEBGE

Coach Len Casanova had nothing but praise for.his team after the

Rice game.

"it was a tough one for the boys to lose, but if they knock some-

body else around like they did
Rice, they're going to win.”

The Panther players were pretty
well broken up over the loss, for
they realized that victory was
within their grasp several times.

It # ¥

The toughest beak of all came
when the referee nullified Tony
simile's long run in the final
quarter by caning a clipping
penalty on Bob Brennen.

Simile had grabbed a Rice
fumble in mid-air on the Pitt 35
and carried it to the Rice 21.
Brennan put a block on at Rice
tackler at midfield that observers
called “perfect,” but the referee
ruled otherwise.

it!

Two of Pitt's key backfield men,
Quarterback Bob Bestwick and
llalfback Bill Sichko saw no action
at all in the second half. Bestwick
sat it out with an injured knee,
while Sichko suffered a mild con-
cussion in the first half and re-
mained in the dressing room for
the rest of the game.

Fred Botti handled himself well

as sub for Bestwick, considering
that it was the first time he had.
really been under fire in his col-
lege career. For three years, Botti
had sat on the bench during the
single wing regime, because his
running ability wasn't up to his
passing ability.

His running cost the Panthers a
scoring chance Saturday. Finding
all his receivers covered on one
occasion, Botti decided to run arid
had rambled a good 20 yards deep
into Rice territory when he fumbled
and the Owls recovered. Botti
practically invited the fumble by
carrying the ball on his hip.

game against Rice, and he made
it his best. Entering the game in

suffered a mild concussion.

Casanova, who was making his
first home appearancezt Pitt coach,
used the two-platoon system for the
first time in Panther history, and
got pleasing results.

Line improved

The famed Pitt line, which had
thus far failed to live up to its
clippings, finally looked like the
mean, rugged wall that it was sup-
posed to be. That is, the defensive
line.

The offensive line looked a bit
ragged, however. What frequently
appeared to be offsicles to the
casual eye, was actually the Pan-
thers’ inability to hit and charge
together.

Rice was able to set up one TD
and score a second by reason of
Pitt's pass defense going to sleep,
but the Panther defenders somewhat
improved over their showing at
Duke and Ohio State. This coming
weekend, they face a passing wiz-

I ard in Northwestern’s Dick (Posey)

F lowers ' Glass Connects

The Cotton Bowlchamps’ winning
touchdown came in the third quarter
when Vernon Glass found Bill How-
ton all by himself in the end zone.
A Glass-to-Bob Allen aerial set up
the Owls’ first score, and three
plays later, Billy Burkhalter plunged
over from the one.

The lone Pitt tally came with 55
seconds gone in the secondquarter.
Bob Bestwick pulled a quarterback
sneak from the half-yard line.

The score was made possible
when the brilliant Billy Reynolds
intercepted a pass to put the ball
on the Rice 37. Bestwick passed to
Nick DeRosa on the three, andHalf-
back Armand DiFonso moved it to
within inches of the goal line.

Miss Joan Reichman,
Female Nagurski “’“E§$C'.".‘TZEf“‘“

Two sororities, the AE Phis and the Phi Mus, staged a touch
football game at the Schenley Oval Friday before several hundred
spectators -—mostly male. It was expected that the De an of

Women’s Office would raid the af-
fair, but since no such interruption
took place, the AE Phis were able
to put together a bona fide 16-0
victory.

The victors played with sweat
shirts,_ blue jeans, saddle shoes,
and B0. Generous containers of
Air-Wick should have been circu-
lated in every huddle.

Sartoriol Slaps

As for their opponents, they even
looked the shoddy part of losers.
You’d think they could have scared
up six jerseys of the same color,
but no.They not only lost the game,
but because of their sartorial im-
perfection, also came out second
in showing-off honors.

It was a cold, windy day -- de-
cidedly unfavorable for one’s hair-
do. If there had been twins in the
ball game, neither would have had
the Toni. The left end for the AE
Phis,a smallish blonde who smoked
glamourously during time-outs, pro-
ce eded to develop a wind-blown
head of hair that resembled a floor
mop hanging out a second-story
window.

Television cameras ground away,
and the girls were courteous enough
to pause, with third down and goal
to go, for posed video pictures.

Reichman Terrific

There was, however, one partici-
pant who endeared herself to the
crowd by sincerely playing a little
football. She was Miss Joan Reich-
man, a running, passing, kicking,
blocking, pass-catching, hell-on-
legs of a woman.

Playing for the winners, Miss
Reichman snared one touchdown
pass, and on another play, inter-

, cepted an aerial and bulleted the

length of the field (about 40 yards)
for another TD.
Miss Reichman, only an average-

I’

sized female,was aided in her feats
by a large wad of chewing gum
which she munched furiously while
skirting ends and returning punts.

Another Turner

On defense, she backed up the
line. She would crouch low, tens-
ing herself in preparation for bust-
ing through the line like Bulldog
Turner on a rampage. Once, while
running interferance for a ball-
carrier, Miss Reichman threw a
murderous block on an opponent,
and then, in sporting fashion, re-

turned to assist the gasping, half-
conscious victim to her feet.

Showing the mark of an outstand-
ing performer, Miss Reichman never
made the same mistake twice. On
her first kick-off, she approached
the ball with low, long, Groucho
Marx-like steps. The resulting kick
was a ground ball that petered out
of bounds.

Quite 0 Gal

On her next try, however, Miss
Reichman minced up to the ball and
booted a line drive which sent the
Phi Mus scattering for cover and
landed in the end zone. Quite a gal,
this Miss Reichman.

All in all, though, the average
player in the game was an affected,
untalented female who ought to have
stuck. to draping herself over a
Tuck Shop booth. This should go to
college?

iS.P. Langley,/lir Pioneer,
Was First Pitt Astronomer

, By 303 LEWIS
Kg Samuel Pierpont Langley, noted astronomer and airplane pio-
neer, was the first director of the Allegheny Observatory, one of
Pitt’s lesser known branches. Following amalgamation with the
University in 1867, the beginning of Langley’s directorship, the
Observatory has had a long record of service to Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania, and the nation.

Mr. Langley built the first heav-
ier-than-air craft capable ofsus-
tained free flight in the history of r
the world. His experiments proved
the theory of inclined planes and
foresaw the great velocities at
which man could someday travel
through the air.

Twice Langley succeeded in
launching his “aerodrome” which
flew over half a mile at the unheard
of speed of 30 miles per hour. The
experimental airplane, however,
never successfully carried a pass-
enger and was doomed to be called
“Langley’s Folly.”

Years later his man-carrying air-
ship was tested bythe Curtiss Corp-
oration and proved its remarkable
stability and ease of handling.
