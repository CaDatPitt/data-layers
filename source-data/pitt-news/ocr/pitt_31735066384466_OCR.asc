Posvar Urges ‘Tuition-Saving’ $1 0.5 Million Boost

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staffwriter

HARRISBURG—Chancellor Posvar
delivered Pitt’s case for an additional $10.5
million in state funding to the House
Appropriations Committee here Friday, saying
such an increase would enable the University
to avert another tuition hike.

“If we could just get that increase we could
get by,” Posvar said.

Governor Shapp’s proposal to the General
Assembly for ﬁscal year 1978-79 held Pitt’s
appropriations at $60.4 million, or $10.5
million below the school’s request of $70.9

million. . _
Posvar, along with several key University

administrators, told the House committee the
$10.5 million figure represents a seven percent
annual increase accorded other state agencies

, the past three years. ’
‘ ‘We’re only asking for fair treatment, ” the

Chancellor added.

He said no adjustment in Shapp’s budget
would bring Pitt its third consecutive year of
zero increase in state funding and a decline in
constantdollars of more than 20 percent.

“Obviously no organization, large or small,
public or private, can take this kind of blow
without some traumatic effect,” Posvar said.
He added that Pitt has been forced to raise
tuition “again and again.”

The Chancellor said tuition increases have
made it more difficult for children of lower-and
middle-income families to attend the
University. He said Pitt’s freshman enrollment
from those families has dropped 15 percent in
the past ﬁve years. ,

“That decline has to correlate with the cost
of tuition,” Posvar added.

The heads of the three other state-related
universities all spoke in a similar vein in asking
for more appropriations Friday.

The amounts the schools asked for and the
amount recommended by Shapp are: Penn
State, $125.9 requested, $106.7 million
recommended; Temple, $74.5 million, $68.5

' million, and Lincoln, $5.5 million, $3.1 million.

As expected, Posvar told committee

' members that funding higher education is the

best public investment for the future, providing
long-range benefits. V
“We train people who make the state work:

engineers, doctors, lawyers and so on,” he
added. ,

Following Posvar’s budget address,
committee members questioned him on
several topics, including aid for med students,
tenure and co-operative academic programs .
with other state-related schools.

At a press conference afterward, student
representatives from Penn State, Temple and
Pitt, including Student Government Board
member Dave Hesidence, called on the state to
increase Shapp’s budget to their schools and to
create a new form of budgetary process.

“Unless the state legislature adopts a state
budget that provides funding for the
state-related universities far above and beyond
the levels proposed by Governor Shapp,
quality education in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania will become a dream realized by
a privileged minority,” Hesidence said in a
prepared statement.

“We, representing the students of the
state related universities, feel this would be a‘
tragedy of immense and far-reaching
proportions and one that the citizens of
Pennsylvania‘ could not afford.’ ’

RSA toTake

‘The Resident Student
Association (RSA) will take its
complaint against recent housing
hikes before Chancellor Posvar at
tomorrow"s Student. Affairs
Advisory Committee (SAAC)
meeting.

RSA chairman Phil Cillo said
yesterday that after r_ecent talks
with Auxiliary Services director

also an incumbent-,-—win by a slim
margin in a 17-vote victory over
Michael Jones.

votes over Sonya Liggons and Bill
Harper. '

“We (Harris, and Holloway) said
last year we could do the best job,
and we said we could do it again this

Don Hughes, he believed it was
time to take the matter to “higher
levels.”

The RSA’s complaint stems from
a University decision to increase
housing rates for Forbes Pavillion,
Bruce Hall and McCormick Hall
cathedral suite accommodations in
the fall. After housing rate
increases were announced earlier
the housing office only recently
tacked on another $24 for these
areas.

“Housing never consulted any-

Cillo said. “They left out -the RSA

not think this was quite fair."

The RSA responded to the
increases last week by releasing‘
“counter-proposals” which called
for only a $12 increase for the

“It was a middle-of-the-road
compromise,” Cillo said,
"Students should pay a little more

because of the much nicer cathedral
facilities.”

Cillo stated more emphasis
should be placed on renovating
current dorm facilities.

“Housing was unwilling to make
renovations to existing campus
buildings,” he said. “They tend to
neglect these buildings and facili-
ties. The buildings are then

relegated to a second-rate position ,

in their minds.”

Cillo believes the RSA has the
support of the Student Government
Board (SGB) president Josh
Baylson.

“They (SGB) are sympathetic
with us,” Cillo said. ‘ ‘They think we
have a legitimate complaint and
they arequpset with the situation.”

Cillo also said talks with business
and ﬁnance administrators were
encouraging.

“They believed there was a .
serious breakdown in communica-
tions and feel something must be

,done,”,,said Cillo. “They. agreed

that we had a good complaint and it .
was my opinion that they think the 5

Cillo said the RSA would not take

Local Miners Criticize Carter

By The Associated Press
MONONGAHELA, Pa."-Members of United Mine Workers
Local 2244 took note of candidate .I_immy Carter’s 1976; visit to their
grimy workplace Sunday as they were told to go back to work.

“He’s taken big industry’s side,” scowled curly-haired doe
Vilchek, who recalled shaking the President’s hand when Carter and
a phalanx of security agents toured the Mathies Mine about 25 miles

south of Pittsburgh.
“I’m a damn good Democrat, but he’s made a Republican out of
me,” said Walter Sgaggini, who’s been a miner for 41 years since

pi; taking a job at the age of 15.

“Jimmy Carter talks about human rights, but what rights is he
giving us coal miners?”

The miners were bitter about the President’s decision to invoke
the Taft-Hartley Act and seek a court-ordered, 80-day cooling off
period in the UMW’s nationwide strike.

One of them suggested that a copy of the order directing them to
return to work be distributed so that ﬁnancially strapped families
can use it for “commode paper.”

The responsed came as local union president Alvin Berkich told
about 300 strikers assembled in the smoky Monongahela Turner’s
Club that the back-to-work order took effect with the 12:01 a.m. shift
Mondav. -

“I have to tell you to go to work...and that’s exactly what I’mi
telling you to do,” Berkich said. A

Bridgeville Residents File Second

 Suit Against Koppers Co.

By The Associated Press

BRIDGEVILLE, Pa.-Residents of this Allegheny County
community have ﬁled a second lawsuit against Koppers Co. as a
result of a series of toxic chemical leaks.

About 20 families last week asked Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court to force Koppers to stop what the suit calls violations of
various pollution laws. -

The residents recently sued for $700,000 in damages to
themselves and their property.

“We’re not trying to close them down, but we do want Koppers to
solve its emission problems,” said Anthony P. Picadio, one of two
attorneys representing the residents.

The latest suit accused Koppers of knowing that the residents
were being exposed to dangerous concentrations of chemicals, but
failing to notify them so that they could take precautions.

 The suits were ﬁled about a week apart after county health

authorities last month identiﬁed ﬁve speciﬁc leaks of respiratory
irritants-vanadium pentoxide, phthalic anhydride andbenzene, a
suspected carcinogen.

Avalanche Buries l4 in Switzerland

mountain slopes near this village in western Switzerland yesterday,
burying at least 14 skiers under a deep blanket of snow, authorities
announced. ’ .

First reports said" between 15 and 60 skiers might have been
trapped. ‘Police later said they knew of only 14 persons missing but
they acknowledged there could be more.’

“It was a huge, horrible monster,” a police spokesman said.
“We can safely say that we are looking for 14 victims, seven Swiss
and the rest French, but there. may be more.”

 He said two skiers were quickly rescued but “there are others in
‘ ’‘*'there somewhere-we just don’t know how many or where.”

A massive search was launched involving some 250 volunteers,
Swiss uniformed soldiers, air rescue helicopters and Red Cross
workers. Trained tracker dogs alsolwere being used.

Flood lights were brought in to help in the search.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

The Budget Hearing

Chancellor Posvar will probably report to the Faculty Senate
Council this afternoon on his testimony before the State House
Appropriations Committee last Friday. He is not likely to bring
back an encouraging word.

The Chancellor presented the committee with several‘ important
facts of academic life during this testimony.

It is becoming more and more difficult for lower and lower-
middle class students to attend Pitt, he said. Among public univer-
sities, Pitt, Penn State and Temple have the nation’s highest tuition
rates, although the average Pennsylvania student's ability to pay is
20 percent below the national average.

Education is a good investment, Posvar reminded the legislators.

~.
Q-an
4

.A.L.4.

 

Students who matriculate in Pennsylvania tend to stay in Penn-

sylvania, and they are a boon to the economy. Seven thousand
persons are employed at Pitt, and they pay nearly $7 million in state
and local taxes each year, he said. ~ 

The funding freeze the University has experienced during the
past three years “calls into question the commitment of the govern-
ment of Pennsylvania to the very idea of public higher education,”
Posvar said. “If the trend is not soon reversed...academic
programs cangbeseriously damaged.’ ’

Overall, theféhancellor said nothing new or surprising during
Friday’s plea to the House Appropriations Committee. The basic
issues have been the same for several months; public problems,
even when resolutely ignored, do not usually go away, nor do they
significantly change theirshape

It is difficult to keep from being downright pessimistic about the
future of public higher education in Pennsylvania. The most
discouraging thing has been the almost total lack of response-of
any kind—-from the legislators. The University’s advocates have
advanced argument after argument, but the people who pull the
pursestrings have not responded in kind, not even with any stron
counterarguments. »

It’s as if the legislators were trying to ignore public higher
education to death. We suspect that this is because the political
risks involved in a more productive dialogue are not, in the
legislators’ minds, worth it.

Letters to the Editor

Credibility in Advertising

This letter concerns itself with the
full page ad run by Daniel's Realty
in the March 8 issue of the paper.

There are several misleading
quotes within the ad that have the
potential of deceiving- the reader.

(1) The words “Campus Housing
Man” give the distinct impression
that'Mr. Mosse is in some way
connected with this campus. He is
not.

(2) The use of the word“ap-
proved” gives the impression that
the University has officially ap-

proved Mr. Mosse. I daresay it has
not.

I realize that the income received
from an ad of that size is
substantial. Still, as an organ of the
Pitt student body I should think that
you should seek to be aware of such
misleading wording in an ad.

I have dealt with Mr. Mosse, and
while he is not the worst landlord
that I have dealt with, he is not all
peaches and cream. The invest-
ment of renting an apartment is a
move that can have serious legal

repercussions. The service that
your paper renders should, in the

future, be administered with a 1ittI%“' '

(directly) discourage students from

asking that The Pitt News use a little
more professional discretion in

~o(\’”

euphemistically call “detention.”

By GARY GOVERT

A few days ago I stumbled into
an unusually rewarding conversa-
tion: I was able to talk, for about
three hours, with a black South
African who has been involved in

'the movement for change in his

country.

John—his real name and how we
met are best left unpublicized—is
an intellectual. _‘ Not an intellectual
in the disparaging sense of the
word that we Americansgtend to
employ (i.e., egghead), ‘but “an
intellectual
sense—a learned, articulate, re-
spectable thinker. He has been, for

a number of years, part of the black _

consciousness movement in South
Africa—a movement I first learned

about last September, through the if

death of Steven Biko.

Like Biko, John has spent time
in what the South Africans rather

in the Old World--7-7

He was a first-time offender
though, and his political offense
was relatively mild, so he was
released after several weeks. He
did not end up like Biko, or like the
black radicals who simply disap-
.pe.a.r'.and.are later reported to have

hanged themselves, or to have
jumped from a window.

(The Pretoria Government made
a mistake with Biko, John says. He
was too well-known, and we found
out about him. But there are many,
many more.) I .
 John and} talked about Bike and
about what  black consciousness
movement is up’ against. Apar-
theid, he. conﬁrmed,‘ ‘not only
separates blacks from whites; it
also separates blacksfrom blacks.

Buthelezi of the Zulus-—have en-
couraged this intra~racial ethnic
separation.

‘Black consciousness tries, mostly
in appeals to the young, to bring
unity to South Africa's culturally
diverse majority; it tries to bridge
the -ethnic chasms ~ created by
enforced tribalism.’ For without
this unity, John said, blacks can
never challenge the powerful white

Government. “Conscientizing” is I

working, he said,—but it will be a
long, slow process.

‘t We next talked about the
feasibility of economic sanctions
against South Africa. John said it
is not true, as some have claimed,
that a cutoff of United States
‘investment would harm South
African blacks more than it would
hurt the Government. It would, in
the short run, cause a loss of jobs,

2 I especially in urban areas. But the

resultant return of many blacks to
subsistence agriculture would, in
the long run, help them to build an
economy that better suits their
needs.

The loss of investment is feared
by the Government; John said,
because it would undermine the
state-serving, high-technology eco-
nomy that now dominates the lives
of all South Africans. Western
journalists and diplomats who visit
South Africa don't seem to learn
this, he surmised, because they
only talk to blacks who have been
co-opted by the Government. All
the radicals are in jail or otherwise
safely put away.

(To a large extent, John echoed
the sentiments of Steve Biko, who
said in an’ interview shortly before
he was killed: “If Washington is

really interested i,n,_,contributing to
.,L:..--- . ~-,—._ .v:,,.»-,- .--.,

the development of a just society in
South Africa, it (will) discourage
investment in South Africa. We
blacks are perfectly willing to
suffer the consequences. We are
quite accustomed to suffering”)
Finally, John and I talked at
some length about his radical
Christianity. A
Now, it is difficult enough to be a
Christian in America—what with

SIDELINES  

Black consciousness
tries, mostly through
appeals to the young, to
bridge the ethnic
chasms created by en-
forced tribalism.

the slings and arrows of outrageous
secularism swirling about one’s
head-——but consider John's situa-

tion. He is a black Christian living ‘

under a white racist Government
that rules in the worst tradition of
Calvinism—aparthe_id in the name
of Christ. As a white Christian
whose theology is largely Calvin-
istic, it is enough to make me want
to go hide in my prayer closet.

John, however, has a different
response. I-Ie recognizes in the
theology of Afrikaner nationalism
the same spirit that led churchmen

of the American South to claim
biblical justification for slavery
during the l800’s—and he has
already begun to fight this
perversion of the faith (hence, the
“detention ' ’).

But John also recognizes the
error that South African blacks
make when they reject Christianity
because of the Afrikaners’ heresy;
to do‘ so, he says, is to mistake the

theology for the faith, to mistake
the appearance of the thing for the
thing itself. It is the same mistake
made by many Americans, who
disavow the church on account of
the hypocrites who so often people
it. Correcting this case of mistaken
identity is, for John, the other side
of the polemical coin.

The chances for future political
change were the focal point of our
conversation, however, and I
eventually asked John the question
that often proves most diﬁicultwf. ,_
Christians: What about violencriﬁ-I

Organized violence from across
the borders is nearly hopeless,
John said. The South African
military is simply too strong. (It is,
without much doubt, the strongest
in Africa.) Internally based
guerrilla warfare would probably
be just as ineffective, he said.

But sabotage—-blowing up Gov-
ernment buildings, trains and the
like —is a good bet, according to
John. He would, as a Christian,
have no qualms about suppot-t‘i_nr}_
such sabotage, though he was‘-..i*,
sure he was cut out for the act‘ ’
bombing itself. He seemed
unwilling to think about the lives
that might be lost, but he had
clearly made up his mind.

Now, days after our conversa-
tion, I’m still thinking about the
sabotage thing. It is something far
away from me, and it is something I
have time to think about.

John does not enjoy that kind of
leisure. He'll be going back to
South Africa before long. He told
me, in response to a question, that

he doesn't expect to see t 8’'’?2,’

PARIS——A Socialist-Communist
alliance challenging 20 years of
Gaullist rule was winning a slim
popular majority Sunday in the first
round of French legislative elec-
tions, computer projections
showed.

The combined left was given just
over 50 percent of the vote, short of
pre-electoral opinion poll predic-
tions that ranged as high as 56
percent. The ruling center-right
coalition was projected to be
winning 45-46 percent.

a The rest was scattered among
m

inority groups whose votes could
prove decisive in the second, run-off
round of elections next Sunday.

Analysts said the leftist bloc—the
Socialists, Communists and the
small Leftist Radical Party—would

need solid support from minority ,

parties, such as ecologists and
extreme leftists, to turn a narrow
popular victory in the ﬁrst round
into a parliamentary majority in the
second.

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
It interesting to look at the
television ratings for the 7 p.m. to
7:30 p.m. time slot Monday-
NBC’s national
news show, with John Chancellor,

I is last; WPGH’s “Hogan’s Her-

oes” is third; the CBS news, with
Walter Cronkite, is second; and
ﬁrst place is held securely by
WTAE’s “Bowling for Dollars.”
On June 18, 1978, “Bowling for
Dollars” will celebrate its ﬁfth

x anniversary, with a record that has

shown a rating increase each year.

When WTAE decided to follow
the lead of other stations across the
country, John Conomikes, station
vice-president, told Nick Perry, who
was selected to host “Bowling for
Dollars,” that the show would make
him “the biggest name in
Pittsburgh.”

“No matter where I go now, I’m
recognized,” said Perry. “To this
day, I still tell John he picked a
winner (‘Bowling for Dollars’).”

It is fitting that mass recognition
should be accorded to a man who
will celebrate his 30th anniversary
in the broadcasting ﬁeld this year.

:-Perr be an his career at a radio

station in Charleston, W.Va.,
making $28 a week and living in
what had once been “the biggest
whorehouse in West Virginia.”

lucrative proposition; the weekly
salary increased to $75 a week, and

Perry found a job as a croupier at a
dice game at night that matched his
broadcast salary.

“Every six weeks, I’d drive over
300 miles to Pittsburgh, where my
wife and oldest son lived,” Perry
said. “It took around seven hours to
get there and the roads were so
desolate that if my car had ever
broken down—God help me.”

In 1950, Perry retired from radio
and, having returned to Pittsburgh,

..   . 

magazine-type show entitled “This ,
is Pittsburgh,” Perry was respon- ...
sible for coming up with interesting
subjects, as well as doing the show.

 

“This one show we did was from a
state trooper‘, training school, and
I sat in_the backseat of a. patrol car
while one of the trainees took his
driving test,” Perry said. “After
the test was over, I ended the
segment by interviewing the
instructor. I asked him how the

became a television announcer,

working for WDTV (Channel 3),
WENS (Channel 16) and KDKA
(Channel 2) before becoming the
first announcer hired by WTAE-TV
in 1958. Those days, when
television was suffering from
growing pains, laid the groundwork
for the industry as we know it today.

Those eight years were anything
but dull for a newcomer to
television like Perry.

“My first audience participation
show was “Polka Party” on WDTV,
which was called the ‘Window of the
World,’ ” Perry said. “I would
announce the songs, and then I had
to dance with the people who came
to the studio. Ialways picked the fat
ladies, and one day the lady I was
dancing with tripped, and we both
fell down."

When John Galbraith, Bob Prince
and others decided to start a UHF
station, Perry did an audition and
found himself with a new job. Most,
if not all, of his job changes were
inspired by a need for more money.

Rosewell did play-by-play for

game from Cincinnati, and after-

drive took about six hours, and
Rosey never shut up the whole time.
I always thought I knew a lot of
jokes, but Rosewell told jokes for six
straight hours, and I never had

entire right side was coated with
tobacco juice.”

Many men might develop an
inﬂated view of themselves after
years in the public eye, but Perry
seems to have kept his feet in direct
contact with the ground throughout
his career. ‘

“I had to be the world's worst
disc jockey——bar none,” Perry said
about his radio career. “I really
don’t know why they kept me as
long as they did.”

On Sept. 18, 1958, Perry was
hired as an announcer for the
newest television station in
Pittsburgh, WTAE-TV.

“I have more seniority than
anyone at the station,” Perry said,
“so I'll be there until hell freezes
over.”

Perry is a staff announcer for
WTAE, which means that he puts in
40 hours every week doing work
such as commercials and station

breaks, besides his two shows,
“Bowling for Dollars” and
“Greater Pittsburgh Championship
Bowling.”

“I’ve buried more shows than
any other local announcer,” Perry
said. “Outside of the news, local
shows just don’t last too long.”

Among the shows that are now in
the grave are “It’s in the Name,”
“Namingo,” “Dialing for Dollars”
and “Pin Busters.”

“It’s in the Name” was a game
show that had contestants’ re-
arrange scrambled letters into
words during a time limit.

‘ ‘I remember this one young lady
won $8,000 on the show and put a
down payment on a home she
always wanted,” Perry said. “I
even know where the house is; it’s
on Saltzburg Road.”

“Dialing for Dollars” was a
morning movie show, where money
was given to any telephone caller
able to correctly state the count for
the day and the amount of money in
the jackpot.

“One time I called this lady who
couldn’t give me the answers, so I
told her the station would send her a
consolation, prize, which was

policy,’ ’ Perry said. ‘ ‘A couple days
later, I got a letter from her that
said, ‘Be sure and send my
constipation prize, you cruk.’

“One day we ran the reels of the
movie in the wrong order, and no
one even noticed, not even the
people upstairs,” he said. “I guess
that showed how many people paid
attention to that show.”

“Greater Pittsburgh Champion-
ship Bowling” has been on the air
19 years; for 17% years, it has been
broadcasted live. The show has
featured bowlers of national
prominence such as Don Carter,
along with bowlers familiar only in
the Pittsburgh area. These years of
experience made Perry a likely
choice as host when Conomikes
decided to bring “Bowling for
Dollars” to Pittsburgh.

“Bowling for Dollars” needs
little explanation—any bowler who
throws two consecutive strikes
breaks the jackpot and splits it with
a home viewer, called a “pin pal.”
Most viewers form either a love or
hate relationship with the show.

Contestants, most in front of a
television camera for the ﬁrst time
and some with the tendency to be
frank, have given Perry some
interesting experiences.

One of the most satisfying
moments of his career occurred
during a showgwhen Perry did an
interview with a young man who
stuttered very badly. Some patience
and a little coaching by the veteran
announcer helped the man put
together more words without
stuttering than he had ever done
before.

“I spent about 10 minutes with
him before the interview, and told
him to think of the ﬁrst word he was
going to say before saying it, ” Perry
said. “If he just tried to pronounce
the ﬁrst letter and go from there, I
knew he’d never get the word out.

“Well, we did the entire

interview, and he didn’t stutter
once,” Perry added. “After the
show, his mother came out of the
audience and kissed me, and later I

able to get through to the young
man.”

Many viewers believe that
“Bowling for Dollars” is ﬁxed, that
the station plants a ringer on the
show to break the jackpot, who then
gives the money back to the station.
That is why Perry loves to see
someone who doesn’t appear
capable of even lifting a bowling
ball break the jackpot.

“This one lady came on the show
who was about 5-6 and no more than
98 pounds,” Perry said. “One of the
ﬁrst things she wanted to know
before we went on the air was
whether I noticed that she didn’t
have any teeth. Now, you’d have to
be blind not to notice, but I told her
you couldn’t tell just to put her at
ease.

“When she bowled, it took the
ball about ﬁve seconds to get down
the alley, but she broke the jackpot
and won over $3,000,” Perry
recalled. “Then I asked her what
she was going to do with the money
and she said, ‘Get myself a set of
false teeth.’ ”

Cases of extreme nervousness
are common, Perry said, and must
be dealt with carefully so contes-
tants don’t fall apart on the air.

“One guy was afraid he would
forget the people he brought to the
studio with him, so he wrote their
names on his hand in red ink,”

Perry said. “When the time came
for him to identify the people, he
looked at his hand, but the ink
smeared because of the perspira-
tion and he couldn’t read a thing. So
then he tried to name the people
from memory, and the first person
was his daughter and he couldn’t
remember her name. Eventually,
someone from the audience had to
tell him. ‘

“Another time this guy was on
the show and before we went on the
air, he seemed to be a real
extrovert,” Perry continued.
“Well, his turn came up, I
announced him and no one walked
out. I announced him again and no
one came out again. So, we brought
out the next bowler, and thenbroke
for a commercial.

“I saw the guy standing in the
back, and he told me he was just too
nervous to walk out in front of all
those people. Itold him to come out
now while the commercials were
running and then when we signed
back on, he'd already be standing
there. Well, that’s what we did, and
he was ﬁne and almost broke the
jackpot.”

People often say interesting
things when a microphone is put in
front of them, Perry said, and an
announcer must be ready to deal
with an embarrassing situation as
soon as it presents itself.

manager for a fried ‘chicken
franchise,” Perry said. “I asked her
if he brought home any free
samples, and she said, ‘Hell no, I’m
sick and tired of that crap.’

“We deleted that from the
interview so her husband wouldn’t
be reprimanded by his bosses, even
though it made the interview
interesting.

“Another time a man came on
and told me he was a proofreader for
a printing company,” Perry said.

“When I asked him for more details I’

about his job, he said, ‘I make sure
there ain’t no mistakes.’ ”

In the case of an announcer,
mistakes are made in front of large
audiences.

“One time this lady, who was a
deaf-mute, was to be on the show,
and she had her daughter with her
to answer my questions,” Perry
said. “At the end of the interview,
she was going to say ‘hello’ in sign
language. Well, I let the audience
know what was going to happen,
and I put the microphone in front of
this lady as if you could hear sign
language. I felt really bad.”

Despite his citywide fame, Perry

is an active member of his Highland"

Park neighborhood, giving basket-
ball and handball lessons to
children and participating in his
street’s group snow shoveling
effort. To his family, his fame comes
from the type of person he is, not
how many hours his face is seen on
television.

“When Nick first started in
broadcasting, the whole family
would watch,” he wife, Georgia,
said, “but then it just becomes
routine, like anything else.”

Body on Ice 

To Prayers

By The Associated Press

REEDS SPRING, Mo.—After
praying over a freezer for more than
two hours, a preacher admitted
Sunday that he had failed to raise
his mother from the dead.

Evangelist Daniel, Aaron Rogers
and the three other preachers he
had recruited to assist him in the
“resurrection service” said they
had “tried eyerything Jesus told us

to do, and we don’t know what we;@,_

wrong.”

Gladys Rogers, 80, died Feb. 2 in
Harrison, Ark., 25 miles south of
this southwest Missouri town.
Rogers packed her body in dry ice
for six days, then had it placed in the
freezer. It took him more than a
month to win a permit to have the
body removed from Arkansas to the
Clarkson Mortuary here.

Reeds Spring was the only place
he could ﬁnd a mortician who would
go along with his plan.

“Jesus commanded us to preac . }‘
the gospel, heal the sick, raise th ‘

dead,” said Rogers, when asked his
motive.

He had said his mother would rise
from the dead and give a sign that
“the end of this age” is near.

Rogers arranged for gospel
singers from St. Louis to lead
singing in an adjoining chapel as he
and his fellow preachers prayed for
the resurrection to occur in a
combination ofﬁce and visiting
room, closed off from the chapel,
where the freezer was powered by a
portable generator.

“TA UDshow ” a Triumph for 99 Cent Theater ..

By MICHAEL X. ZELENAK

TAUDshow

Directed by John Pynchon Holmes
99c Floating Theater Festival
Kresge Theater, Carlow College

This weekend, Pittsburgh
audiences got an inspired vision of
the French poet Antonin Artaud.
The four-day engagement of
“TAUDshow,” part of the 99c
Floating program, ended last night.
The play opens Wednesday off-
Broadway in New York at the
Performing Garage Theater for a
ﬁve-week run.

“TAUDshow” is a stark and
intimate one-man show that tries to
recreate what French playwright
Andre Gide called “the incredible
passion of Artaud.”

Actor Jerry Mayer starts the
one-hour piece by reading one of
Artaud’s letters. He unveils two
large photographs of the poet and
proceeds to change clothes on
stage. This casual ceremony shows
the actor assuming the role.

As the production unfolds, Mayer
is transformed and becomes a man
possessed. His voice, facial ex-
pressions and physicality changes.
The personality of Artaud fuses
with that of the actor. The spirit of
Artaud/Mayer becomes the domi-

nant and unifying force of the play.
There is no plot. Dialogue and
action become insignificant. The
impelling power of the presentation
transcends any normal concept of
characterization or role-playing.

The life of Artaud is tragic. The
gifted poet/actor/writer was born
in 1896. At ﬁve, he was stricken by
cerebral meningitis. He became a
lifetime opium addict and was
conﬁned to an‘ asylum as early as
1915. From 1937-1946 he never saw
the outside world. His incarceration
at Rodez and the prolonged, painful
sessions of electro-shock treatment,

‘Rhoda-esque’ but I won't take any
of them.”

Harper proved that stereotyped
image could be broken by
portraying a dramatic character in
Jerome Kilty’s “Dear Liar,” a
production presented at Pitt last
week and is currently touring

‘campuses throughout the country.

But despite her objections to
being seen as Rhoda, the character
is still connecting the actress with
her audience. She receives mail
from her viewers who tell her about
their involvement in the program
and their identiﬁcation with her
problems.

“But the mail doesn’t shape our
programs in any way. The show
succeeds because the writers write
what they feel is entertaining and
what they feel is funny.”

Harper said the relationship
between Mary Richards (Mary
Tyler Moore) and Rhoda on the old
“Mary Tyler Moore Show” was
‘ ‘ absolutely fantastic. ’ ’

“The key to my character was to
move Mary’s behind—to move that
‘shiksa’. I used to call her ‘kid,’
which I developed myself. I was
patronizing this dumb cheerleader
who needed to be pushed. It wasn’t
that she was really dumb but just
that I was city-wise.”

I Television, as a common
medium, has not only brought
viewers to speciﬁcally identify with
“Rhoda,” Harper said, but has
brought the whole culture together.

“Television establishes a com-
monality between people,” she
added. “We can all share the same
experience and yet have individual
reactions . ’ ’

 » ‘ ‘ ’ ~

Before becoming successful in
“Rhoda,” Harper was a dancer in a
number of Broadway musicals. At
age 17, she began her career in
theater where she was making only
$72 a week and later got a raise to
$94. B

Asked what advice she could give
students interested in pursuing the
entertainment ﬁeld, Harper said

Harper said as far as auditions
are concerned “there are not 300

and the other person.

competition and make that audition

explodes, as the rasping, gesticula-
ing Artaud/Mayer gropes,
struggles and tears himself apart.
The spirit of Artaud is conjured up

in this frenetic alchemy.

The ﬁnal ﬁfteen minutes of the
play, where Artaud/Mayer listens
to a recording of the last scene of his
play “To Have Done with the
Judgement of God” (1947), is an
amazing and overwhelming
experience. The audience witnesses
“Hell in Elysium,” ultimate
devolution and apotheosis.

Area Band Revives Jazz

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

Pitt News Staff Writer

“Jazz is coming out of the closet
again,” says Billy Kuhn, drummer
for the Shadyside Quartet.

Representative of the recent
revival of jazz, the group also
includes Harry Cardillo (keyboards
and composer), Dave LaRocca
(electric and string basses and
composer) and George Green
(tenor saxophone).

Newly formed last October, the
group plays Tuesday through
Saturday night at Lou’s Bar in
Shadyside, with a matinee and
open session every Saturday.

All members of the group have
extensive backgrounds in jazz.
Cardillo has played since age
thirteen and traveled extensively
through South America.

“He’s oneof the foremost young

I

composers in the area,” Kuhn

remarked.

LaRocca is a nationally-known
bass player who has played with
such notables as Buddy Rich and
locally with Spider and Co.

As for Kuhn himself, he has had
extensive experience in both rock
and jazz, having played since age
thirteen. He’s performed with just
about every great older jazz
musician. '

George Green, the sax player,
also has an interesting background,
having performed with George
Benson, Charlie Persip and Don
Paterson.

Among the classic jazz ‘musicians
that have influenced the band are
John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Keith
Jarrett and Weather Report.

The group exhibits a profession-
al, well-composed sodiid. Key-
boards, sax and trumpet are the
mainstays of the music. The steady

beat and strong bass provided by
Kuhn and LaRocca respectively
create a good background for the
other musicians to perform.

Through such selections as
Kenny Dorum’s “Blue Bossa,”
Miles Davis’ “Theme” and “81,”
Cardillo’s ﬂuid keyboard work
comes alive, constantly changing,
forming and re-forming chords in
an ever-changing sound. The ﬁne
keyboard work combines with the
lively, rich improvisation on the
trumpet and sax, all elements
working and molding into a ﬂowing’
sculpture of music.

“We’re working toward record-
ing and concert dates in order to
get in front of live audiences,"
Kuhn said. “More and more
people are starting to realize that
there is much more to be offered
than what is heard on, commercial
radio stations. We’d like to reach
as many people as possible with
our music.” »

director John Pynchon Holmes
discussed the production in the
dressing room.

“I ﬁrst turned on to Artaud in
1965,” Mayer related. ‘‘I was in a
stock company that was doing
‘Private Lives,’ and a friend gave
me a book with a selection of
Artaud’s writings.

“I got the idea and began work on
the script two years ago. A one-man‘
show is always difficult, and this
one became a real challenge. I
didn’t want to focus on chronology

or anything like that. The chrono-

logy is there, but it is buried.”

Mayer, a product of the
University of Nebraska and the
NYU School of the Arts, looks upon
the production as a “show and tell’ ’
session.

‘ ‘I want to tell about the poet and
show the double.”

He and Holmes have worked
together for almost twenty years.‘
They were among the seven original
founders of the Manhattan Theater
Project.

“In many ways,” Holmes

explained, “TAUDshow” is more‘

about an actor in performance than
it is about Artaud. Artaud is the
metaphor. The play succeeds or
fails solely with the actor; the words
themselves become insigniﬁcant.”

Director Leon Katz and manager
Brian St. John Schoﬁeld of the
Floating Theater are to be
applauded for another success. The
Floating Theater is alive in the most
vital, real and basic sense of the
world. It is showcasing a force in the
modern drama that is verging on a
transformation of the genre. In
comparison, all “traditional”

theater seems more and more a trite 

fossil. Wonder and awe are
returning to the stage.

“Theater,” says Artaud, “is the
genesis of creation.”

small the part is if you can do it fully.
You are in the salad and the role you

training—85 hours of sensitivity
awareness of one’s self.

Stet|er’s Saga like a Broken Record —|mprove, Improve
Sports

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staffwriter

‘ After setting ﬁve individual
records at last weekend’s Eastern
regional championships, Pitt all-
American swimmer Kathy Stetler
has one thing on her mind as she
prepares for the national champion-
ships to be held next week in
Durham, N.C.

“I’d like to improve my times,”
Stetler said. “I’ve been aiming for
the nationals all year. It would be
nice to do well in them time-wise.”

For Stetler to accomplish this
goal, she would have to improve the
record-shattering times she posted
in the 50-, 100-, and 200-yard
freestyle and 50- and 100-yard

butterﬂy. For another swimmer,
this goal may seem unrealistic, but
for an Olympic hopeful like Stetler,
Pantherette swim coach Kate
Matheson thinks, it’s a very realistic
one.

“She’s having her best season,”
Matheson said. “I don’t see
anything holding her back from
improving her times next weekend.
Right now, she’s swimming so well

that she can do anything she puts
her mind to.” '

Matheson thinks Stetler can chop
off as much as three seconds in one
event (200-yard freestyle), and
she’s predicting similar reductions
in the other events.

‘ ‘I don't see why she can’t hit the
50-plus (second) range in the
100-yard ﬂy and the 100-yard
freestyle,” Matheson said. “She

can drop down to the 23-plus range
in the 50-yard freestyle, too, and I
can see her swimming a 1:50 in the
200-yard freestyle.

In addition to her individual
events, Stetler will anchor both the
200-yard and 400-yard freestyle
relay teams. Along with Patty
Davis, Christy Elstonland Suzanne
Pulley, Stetler swam to team and
meet records in the 200-yard
freestyle relay.

That, record, along with her
individual records, gave Stetler the
distinction of being the ﬁrst
swimmer in the eight-year history of
the Eastern championships to break
six meet records.

For her efforts, Stetler was given

a lengthy standing ovation, the ﬁrst
such ovation accorded any swimmer
in the history of the meet.

“I can still remember the
ovation,” Stetler said. “After the
team had gotten its awards (Pitt
ﬁnished fourth in the team
standings), one of - the women
presenting the awards told me to
stay for a few minutes after the
presentation was over. I didn’t
know what was coming, until I saw
all these people starting to stand up
and applaud.

‘ ‘All of a sudden everyone started
to stand up. It was a strange
experience, seeing all those people
getting up and clapping for you, but
it's one l’ll never forget.”

asts’AIA W Championship Dreams Doused 1

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Call it inexperience or call it bad
luck, but whatever it is called, the
Pantherette gymnasts had their
hopes for a berth to the AIAW
national championship doused be-
cause of it at the Eastern Regional
Championship at the Field House
this weekend.

The young Pantherettes, who
were seeded third behind Clarion
and Penn State prior to the meet,
ﬁnished ﬁfth in a ﬁeld of ﬁfteen,
with a score of 137.0, behind New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, de-
fending national champion Clarion
(second place) and Penn State, who
claimed ﬁrst-place honors in the
Friday team competition.

The participants in the AIAW
National Championship in Seattle
are the winners of the nine regional
competitions held across the nation
this weekend added to the next
seven highest marks nationally.
Head coach Donna DeMarino
believes the Pantherette’s score of
137.0 could possibly place them
among the top scorers in the
nation. .

The Pantherettes top perform-
ers, freshmen Myra Bachuchin and
Bonnie Tressler, completed the
team competition with all-around
tallies of 35.30, enough to make

Bachuchin a finalist for the
following days’ individual competi-
tion on vault and Tressler on ﬂoor
exercise and balance beam.

The next day Tressler went on to
tie for ﬁfth place on the ﬂoor
exercise with Clarion’s Karen
Brezack with a score (a combina-
tion of Friday and Saturday) of
18.0, while Tressler placed ninth on
the balance beam. Bachuchin
placed eighth on the vaulting
portion of the individual competi-
tion with her score of 18.25 despite
a back injury she sustained
vaulting Friday evening.

“Myra and Bonnie have an
excellent chance of placing in
Nationals, as for the rest of the
team, there is an outside chance.
We probably won’t ﬁnd out until
later this week and until then we'll
just be biting our ﬁngernails,”
DeMarino sair‘ .

DeMarino said she was pleased
with the performance of a young
team that turned in its third-high-
est score of the year Friday
evening.

“For a young team with only one
senior, no juniors, two sophomores
competing and the rest freshmen I
think they did a fantastic job,”
DeMarino said. “Of course we
were all disappointed, but that was
only natural.”

Panthers Skate

By JIM PANE

Pitt News Staff Writer

  Pitt’s hockey Panthers rebound-

ed from Saturday’s befuddling 9-4
loss to the Ohio State hockey club
by whipping those same Buckeyes,
8-5, at the Lake Vue Ice Rink
yesterday.

The Panthers saw seemingly
comfortable 3-1 and 4-2 leads
evaporate in that ﬁrst contest and
nearly let the same thing happen to
a 6-0 score yesterday, but two
third-period goals salvaged a split
in the series and raised Pitt’s
record to 13-9-1. With only a single

\>-«game remaining (against Penn
’ State-McKeesport Friday), the

Panthers have assured themselves
of a ﬁfth straight winning season.

In Saturday’s contest, Pitt was
cruising with a 4-2 advantage
before Ohio State dazzled goalie
Tom Slivka and replacement Ken
Greb with seven unanswered goals
through the second and third
periods.

“We just fell apart in the second
and third periods,” said coach Bob
Montgomery after his team gained
revenge yesterday. “We didn’t

 play position hockey. It's basically
 %the same thing that started to

happen today.” ,

who surrendered a coffin-sealing
goal by Pitt’s Tom Sherwin late in
the game.

“Right away, after Ohio State
scored ﬁve in a row, they (the Pitt
players) started getting down on
themselves,” said Russ Musta, the
Moon Township High School coach
who assisted Montgomery behind
the bench during the series. “I
explained to them that you can’t do
that. A mad hockey player is not a
good hockey player. —

“All I told them to do," he
continued, “was to play the
boards. If you win the battle of the
boards, you’ll win the game.”

Pitt took advantage of a
wide-open ﬁrst period in which it
looked like the Panthers were at
times toying with Buckeye goalie

Steve Oakes. After Pitt netminder '

Larry Newell was tested in the
early going, Gallick capitalized on
Pitt’s ﬁrst shot of the game with a
goal at 3:06. Curt Hetz added the
next two Panther scores, one
coming with his back to Oakes and
the other with the Ohio State goalie
trapped out of the net.

From that point, the Buckeyes
started hitting, whiph resulted in a
little more pressure in the Pitt end.
Newell, who faced 47 shots in the
game, was forced to turn aside
several short-range shots, and it

looked as if the momentum was

Part 0ne—A   Major Change in Panther Basketball-

There are those who would say—in fact, when Tim
’Grgurich’s ears are in the vicinity, there are those
who would scream—that the Pitt basketball team
should have won at least 20 games this season. They
would be the impassioned-of-late fans, and they
might be right.

. There, too, are those who would point out that the
Panthers won 16 games -and lost, in often inex-
plicable manner, 11 times this past season. They
would be anyone who has glanced at the season’s
statistics, and they would be right.

-And, finally, there are those who would argue the
team should consider itself fortunate to have escaped
the past five months with fewer than 20 losses. They
would be those who, mindful of a 6-21 season of un-
fulfilled promise, had last cared about Pitt basketball
about the time of the season’s first snow. And, had
the Panthers not turned their season around as winter
term began, those backsliding fans might have been
right.

This season’s early returns did not bode well for
Pitt basketball. This was a team coming off a year
that made one want to forget the sport, let alone the
season.

During that season, only three Panthers had per-
formances that could mitigate the unhappiness of the
year. None had been seniors. Two, Sonny Lewis and
Michael Rice, could be encouraged further by the
fact they had been freshmen. The third, Larry
Harris, had averaged more than 22 points per game
for the second consecutive season. Those three gave
Pitt at least some hope for 1977-78.

But as the new season began, Rice was
academically ineligible. And, before fall term was
over, Rice was studying not textbooks but college
catalogs from other schools. It was, it seemed,
strike one against Tim Grgurich.

But Sonny Lewis had no such troubles. He was
out on the ﬂoor for every game—-until the warmups
were completed. Then, he owned a seat on the bench,
courtesy of a conflict with his coach. When he
was in the game, he on occasion displayed talent
great enough to cause his coach to wince at the
thought of returning Lewis to the bench. Sonny
solved his coach’s problem by transferring to Point

’ even the best shooter can score from the bench.

Park. Striketwo‘.

Ah, but all was not lost. Larry Harris was at Pitt
to stay; so was his shot. When Harris was shooting,
a 20-foot jumper was a high-percentage shot. A
medium-range bank shot was a sure two-point
deposit. Pro scouts came to see Harris; if they came
too early in the season, they saw only how few points

   

 

That, by my count, would have been strike three. I
But Tim Grgurich hadn’t been retired yet.

The reason for what has been a thorough turn-
around of a basketball program lies largely in the
accelerated development of several Panthers. The
easy schedule, the better coaching and Tiger Paul
helped, but it took talent to transform early
January's mediocre 6-5 team to late February’s
reaching-for-more 15-8 squad.

Much of that talent belonged to Sam Clancy, one
of history's few freshmen ever to merit his advance
billing. He averaged 12 rebounds and 14 points per
game, inspired his teammates to rebound as they
never had before and displayed a disposition that

. temporarily put to rest visions of Sonny Lewis, Terry

Peavy, Kelvin Smith and David Washington. The
only problem Clancy creates (for anyone on his side)
belongs to Pitt ‘sports information director Dean
Billick, who must be contemplating whether it is ap-
propriate to describe a player in terms of wingspan
and average altitude.

In Clancy’s case, it is.

Wayne Williams, asked to play a new position for
the third time in three years, responded with a year-
long performance that merited attention as the
team’s most valuable. An all-America on defense
and in hustle, Williams was, at times, the closest

‘been the case a year before.

thing Pitt had to a guard on the court. He handled
the responsibility in a manner that led Pitt to several
wins. ‘

Ed Scheuermann, though still 25 to 30 pounds

away from being the 6-11 complement Clancy could

use, continued to improve. Pressed prematurely into
service as a freshman, Scheuermann will give Pitt
some solid basketball before he leaves. That he can
be an effective big man was proved several times this
season, most strikingly against Maryland.

Pete Strickland, blamed for a portion of Pitt’s
early misfortune by some Pitt followers (who, me?)
when he was a starter, took a seat on the bench at
mid-season. Before the season was over, his
steadying hand, all-out hustle and—yes—-his outside
shooting had been directly responsible for most of
the season’s most important wins.

Terry Knight, though inconsistent, was the team’s
third-leading scorer and second-leading rebounder.
Though Harris usually had more points and Clancy
normally had more rebounds, Knight’s totals usually
were the difference—numerically—between Pitt and
its opponent.

Harris finished his career with the intensity that
was said to have been lacking in his first three and
one-half seasons. The emotional high be exhibited
before the Duquesne game at the Field House was
equalled in extreme by the sense of loss he felt after
the final loss to Villanova.

After that last game of theseason, Pitt’s players
left the Arena dressing room slowly. The positive
aspects of the season far outweighed the negative
facets, but the most depressing moment had come
recently—and with little warning—-when referee
Mickey Crowley and guard Rory Sparrow had com-
bined to hand Pitt a last-second loss. Reminded of
how good the season had been for them and for Pitt,
they began to offer ways in which they could have
done better. They were not offering excuses, as had
Instead, they were
looking ahead to another season, resolving to ‘con-
tinue a Pitt program that has advanced to a position
from which it can fight for the affection and support
of Pittsburgh. ~

Lady Lions Best Gymnasts in East

all-around spots, with Carr taking
ﬁrst on a score of 37.40 (a 9.35
average on each event), while
teammates Jan Anthony, Lisa
Ingebretsen and Pat Spisak collect-
ed fourth, ﬁfth and sixth ﬁnishes
respectively.

Carr, a sophomore from Phila-

delphia virtually stole the show and

every first place award given at the
Eastern championship. Aside from
being a top-ﬂight collegiate per-

‘ former, Carr is also considered to
be an outstanding international -

competitor, having won an unprec-
edented ﬁve gold medals at the
1975 Pan American games at age
16.

Clarion State also had a good
showing in the two-day competi-
tion, with Nancy Jones finsishing
second in Friday’s team all-around.
Jones was also the only competitor
to outscore Ann Carr on a single
event. Jones took advantage of a
fall by Carr on, the unevens in the
preliminaries on Friday and went
on to place ﬁrst with her scoi'e of
18.60.

Reflecting on gymnastics at Pitt,

DeMarino noted that the Panther-
ettes have steadily improved their
performances in regional competi-

tion (21st in 1975; 14 in 1976; 7th in

1977) followed by their fifth place‘

finish this year.

“This is the best season ever at
Pitt for women's gymnastics, and
I’m thrilled with it. I guess maybe
we were just expecting too much

from ourselves this year at
regionals, but there certainly isn’t
anything wrong with setting your
goals high.” .

changing. But a powerplay goal by
Dave Elson and a whistler from the
point by Bob Stein that found its
mark quickly deﬂated the non-stop
Buckeyes.

Tim Duffy notched Pitt’s sixth
goal berore OSU’s Lany Fravel
swiped a rebound off Newell’s pads
and slid -it under the sprawling
netminder with 40 seconds left in
the period to give the Buckeyes :1
glimmer of hope.

Ohio State's ﬁrst-period nopes
turned into second-period goals.
Although Newellcame up with 19
panther-quick saves, he was unable
to continue the heroics for 15
minutes. Four red-lighters by the

 

Buckeyes, who spent most of those
15 minutes in the Pitt zone, sent
the Panthers into the dressing
room thinking about their previous
game.

But Gallick’s game-saving‘
effort straight off the third-period
faceoff fave Pitt a chance to gain its.
composure; The Panthers slowed
the pace to a walk and managed to
hold on.

The only thing left was for
Sherwin to score with four minutes
remaining. The goal was a
beauty—a result of a partial break
that had Sherwin shooting while
riding the hip check of a buckeye
defender.

“After Ohio State's comeback in
the ﬁrst game, they (the Panthers)
didn't need any pep talk to get
them up for this game,” Musta
said. “They knew they could come
out and score goals.

“They (the Buckeyes) did try to
psyche us out, though,” he said.
“They'd say, ‘We didn’t bring so
and so on the trip, and we really
don't care if we win.’ That’s
nonsense. It’ an old tactic, and it
darn near worked.”
