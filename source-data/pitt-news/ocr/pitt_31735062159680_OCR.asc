Alumni End

Campaign

Alumni officials will terminate
their ‘efforts in behalf of the Build-
Fund Campaign at the huge Smor-
gasbord on ]une 13 during Spring
Homecoming.

Five thousand of the alumni have
already chipped in $627,500 to the
fund, «and more contributions are
expected from the crowd of over
2000 old grads who will attend the
Scandinavian-style banquet.

The sums raised so far in the
overall campaign add up to
$7,805,000.

A big circus tent will shelter
the guests at the dinner. It will
be set up on the lawn of the Cathe-
dral at Forbes and Bellefield.

Campus Groups Join Friday

For Tap Day Ceremonies

Although all students attending Tap Day ceremonies will not
receive awards, the first thousand will be given souvenirs of this

year’s Spring Festival.

The Spring Festival committee has brought a supply of decals
to be distributed. These miniature signs may be pasted on books

and other objects. Printed on them
will be "Childhood Daze 1950.”

As in former years, Tap Day
this year will be held on the Cathe-
dral lawn before Heinz Chapel on
Friday, May 5. All 10:30 classes
have been dismissed so that stu-
dents may attend the ceremonies.

The celebration is slated to be
the unofficial opening of Spring
Festival. The date was set two
weeks ahead of Spring Festival to
avoid conflicting with the week of
fun.

Tap Day participants will make
awards during the program. _Four
organizations are tapping members. _

Outstanding men leaders on camp-
us who have attainedjunior standing
will be tapped into Omicron Delta
Kappa, honorary leadership frater-
nity. Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzger-
ald will announce the ODK Award,
the naming of the outstanding
senior man on campus. The name
of the» awardee will be engraved
on ODK walk.

such backgrounds as, publishing, education, criticism, and the
writing and editing of poetry, the essay, the short story, and the

novel.

According to Edwin L. Peterson, chairman of the conference,

the program is designed to sti-
mulate and guide not only writers
but everyone interested in reading
intelligentl-y. '

The series of events is spread
over several hours Thursday and

sc T. E1... New President Tonight
Ewart, Greenberger, ..
Contend for Top

Government Office

By DICK KOVAR
Pitt News Assistant Editor
Climaxing a year marked by factional strife, members of the
1949-50 Student Congress will sit down with their successors at
a banquet tonight to observe the electio'n of next year’s Congress

I
4

Both the incumbent and incoming legislators will meet at the

annual Congress -dinner meeting,

I held at the Royal York dining room,

which President Flora Die-
mert and other retiring members
will report and comment on Con-
gress activities, past and future.

The election of the new president
and other officers _will complete
the evening's agenda.

after

Former Alliance Split

The principal contenders for the
top position are two men who have
been close political allies through-
out the year, Donald Ewart and
Howard Greenberger. Both have
long records of service and partici-
pation in student activities and
government. _

Ewart and Greenberger, along
with Ray Maher, Bill Swanson, and
Dave Cleland (who has since left
school) composed a liberal faction
in Congress which distinguished
itself in several filibustering cru-
sades last fall, most prominent of
which was a narrowly-defeated
attempt to wrest increased free
time for football victory celebra-
tions from the administration. .

Pre-meetingpoliticking and down-
rhe-line voting on the part of the
group, sometimes dubbed the ‘Filthy
Five,’ characterized their solidarity
and forced their opponents in Con-
gress to adopt similar methods.

Maher Backs Ewart

L The election picture, however,
finds Maher and an unknown number
of allies backing Ewart against
Greenberger, who is supported by
Swanson and probably Don Wilde,
Dave Fox, Brenda McCauley, and
an equally unpredictable number of
new members. The latter three
named constitute part of the block
that opposed the Five on most
issues last year. V

Except for Miss McCauley, who
was internally re-elected last week,
none of the incumbents will be able
to offer more than campaign support,
since only the new members and the
candidates themselves, also inter-
ally re-elected, are entitled to’
vote.

. Miss McCauley, as on other issues
in Congress, is an unknown factor,
but will probably side with Green-
berger, according to a prediction
made by Maher.

No Opposition Seen
The fifteen new members who will
be voting with the incumbent hold-
overs will, of course, decide the
election. Both candidates have

been reported as trying to line upi

Lab Has Strong Radio,

No Broadcast Li ense I
* By LEO MOSS .
The University of Pittsburgh owns enough radio equipment to
start a small radio station-as Duquesne University has done. .
In Thaw Hall there is 300 watt AM radio transmitter that Could
broadcast farther than Pittsburgh station \X/PIT and some of the
smaller stations around Pittsburgh. ‘ I ’

"According to John F. Pierce, as-
sistant professor of electrical en-
gineering, the average  station
in Pittsburgh can broadcast no fan-
ther than Pitt could with the fre-
quency modulation transfnitterowned
by the pniversity.

For Lab Use Only

But Pitt has nolicense to broad- »

cast, and at present the equipment
is being used onlyufor laboratory
training purposes.

Besidesthis radio equipment, the
Department of Electrical Engin-

eering has many of the modern de- a

vices used today in industry. One
of the most modem is a 100 watt
remote control transmitter that works
by a dial, the same as a telephone.

In Thaw Hall there is a complete
telephone system that is equivalent
to miles of wire across the country.

Models Used

Since smoke control went into
effect, many of Pittsburgh's fac-
tories have beenusing a precipitron
to filterout the impurities in smoke.
The electronics lab has a model of
this machine to demonstrate to stu-
dents how air can be purified.

When a street light burns out in
Pittsburgh, a special machine is
needed to re-connect the circuit
andkeep allthe lights in that bl_ock
from going out. The same machine
is beingused in the lab under simi-
lar conditions. 74

An induction heater, the same
used to mold plastic forcommercial
purposes, is demonstrated in the
Thaw Hall lab.

FM sound receivers, radar sets,
and a 100,000 volt high voltage
system make up some of the prac-
tical instruments in use for the
training of future electrical engin-
eers.

"There is no junk lying around
the lab,” says Mr. Pierce. The de-
partment has "really good equip-
ment.”

Tseadership T-
Meeting Set

John O.Mosely, headovf the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon national School for
Leader-ship, will speak to an Inter-
fraternity Leadership Conference to

‘ be held at Pitt on Thursday.

The conferenceis set for 7:30 p.m.
in G—34 Cl and is open to all frater-
nity members.

Mr. Mosely will speak on “Frater-
nity Intangible.” He was formerly
presidentof the University ofNevada
but resigned that post to head the ‘
SAE school. He was awarded the
Interfraternity Conference Award for
outstanding service to fraternities

Mag Offers

The Panther’s graduation issue,
slated forpublication May 10,offers
a 50 per cent increase in quantity of
material, according to Don‘ Horowitz,
managing editor. I

The campus humor magazine will
contain 48pagesinste"'adof the usual
32.

Included in the increased format
are several articles which the staff
believe will continue the Panther’s
hold as a sell-out magazine. Every
edition of this ‘school-year has com-
pletelysoldout. The May 10 issue is
the last of the year. '

Within the Panther will be four
short stories, more than any previous
issue this year. One of the stories,
an impression of Hollywood and the
people who run it and work in it, -is’
by John R.iWilson, and is expected.’
to be a very well—received part of
the magazine, according to Horowitz

There will be three serious" fea-
tures about Pitt personalities. A
four-page picture story will be car-
ried on the track team. .-

Only original photographs are be-
ing used in the May 10 issue. Cam-
pus Candids, the photograph spread
with "captions, has been eliminated.
According to Horowitz, this type of
article, though the Panther was one
of the first to use it, has becone
thackneyedin nearly all college mag-
azinesand in book form.

The graduation edition also in-
cludes a “handbook” for students
on communism, which Horowitz de-
scribes as a“serious, useful” article.
This will occupy six pages of the
.magazine. ' ' . r

In addition a four-page cartoon
spread is scheduled. Also, says
Horowitz, jokes, which have proven
to beapopular feature in past issues,
will appear in large numbers.

Students Not Affected
By TV, Survey Shows

By GEORGE

BARBOUR

While two physical specimens hammer-lock and half-nelson
each other on television screens, most college students are at
home wrestling with political science, math, or other subjects.

This general statement summarizes facts obtained from a
survey of college students to find the effects television has had

on them one year after it was intro-
duced into the Pittsburgh area.

The study, conducted by ;Veronica
Maz of the sociology department,
wasmadeinjanuary 1950. Questions
on the survey were answered by 834
undergraduate students taking intro-
ductory sociology courses at the
University.

Transition Different

The transition period from before
to after TV presents sharp differences
between owners and non-owners. The
effects of TV on owners is a more
significant study since mo st people
will probably eventually own receiv-
ing sets.

In this transition period, more
college men go to the bars than
the women. College girls, according
to the study have not increased visits
to public bars. Only one of thirty
girls reported more time spent at
bars, while eleven of the thirty re-
ported less time in public places
where liquor is sold.

In the early experiment of TV, it
was revealed that many set-owners
spent less time studying. The poll
did not discuss the effect on effici-
ency in school.

Stay at Home Now
On the whole, college students
who have TV sets where they live,
spend less time now listening to the

I radio, playing the phonograph, and

attending movies, but more time than
before at home.

Television’s impact on this cross
section of Pitt students has not pro-
duced revolutionary changes in in-
dividual and family habits as pre-
dicted in books and periodicals.

Television just has not “caught
on” with college students, the study
revealed. Although95%of people not
owning sets plan to buy a receiving
set in the future, they are not very
enthusiastic about owningone. They
just take TV for granted and watch

Among the works in MSS are
severalwritings which have attained
national prominence. One of these
is an excerpt from Mrs. Amy Fox’s
new novel, "Kim Dawson,” which

the writers’ conference, Thursday

TV Produces Change

Of the small number of students
who reported that TVhad produced a
change ‘in some activities, most re-
ported more visits to friends, pri-
vate organizations, and taverns. Set
owners stayed at home more often
than before.

The report states that it is “de-
fensible” to assume that TV watchers
will develop discriminating habits of
selecting the programs which appeal
to them.

WSA Makes

Four members of the Women's

Penn State tomorrow to participate
in the annual Pennsylvania Poetry

ish will read dramatic selections,
poetry, and prose narrative during
the festival.

This is the first year any entrants
from Pitt have been registered in the
program -held annually on the Penn

Mildred Ann Ditty, instructor in
speech, coached the team.

‘ of the celebration to’ be broadcast on various local radio

“Cordic 8: Company,” Rege Cor-
dic’s WWSW cacophony of sound from

is hopingthat Cordic’speculiar sound
effects don’t blast Spring Festival
into -next summer.

Starting with "Cordic 8: Com-

Coach Dr. David O'I-oughlin will

to go with Johnny Lohstoeter and
Harry Campney, his top two men,
or else his Pitt Netters will prob-
ably suffer another defeat against
Navy a week from tomorrow.

The need for more power in the

Panthers dropped a 6-3 decision to
Oberlin on Saturday. Only Lohstoeter
and Campney won in singles.

Trying to obtain deeper strength
in the doubles, the Pitts teamed
Lohstoeter with Jim Boyd, No. 4

the Ohioans took a close match.The
Panthers other point came in the
doubles when Campney teamed with
Bob Silberstein to win in straight
sets.

weakened the local ~linksmen. Mi’

lone experienced players on Mc-

Playing

‘Chess’ With Paul Chess

By STAN SKIRBOLL
Paul Chess hopes that the Pitt

coaches have made their last move _

in the game of chess.
Chess, who is‘ now running as
first-string fullback, started his

football career as an end. That was 

as a freshman in Meadville High
School.

The next three years at Mead-
ville, Paul was changed to halfback,
where he made honorable mention
for state honors in his last two
years.

As a freshman at Pitt in 1948,-
however, the cycle started all over
again. Pitt coaches, worriedover
the graduationlosses of Bill McPeak
and Leo Skaldany, moved the 6
foot, 195-pound blond back to the
terminal position.

Back to First Love

The game of chess continued for
Paul in his sophomore year, as
varsity coach Mike Milligan put
Chess back at his first love - the
halfback spot.

This season, with the coming of
the T-formation, ‘Head Coach Len
Casanova has again changed posi-
tions for Chess. Working on the
theory that the backfield must be
fast as well as p‘owerful, Chess
was switched to fullback.

No doubt Chess will do most of
the punting for the Panthers next
season. He did all of it forhis
high school, and subbed quite cap-
ably for the injured Bill Hardisty
last year.

the ball.

Chess did get a chance to lug
the leather in the Penn State game,
and he classifies that one play as
the biggest thrill of his short car-
eer.

In the third quarter, Chess took
a "flat pass from Carl DePasqua and
raced 57 yards up the side line to

Coaching Helped

"I realize I played nothing but
single wing ball in college,” says
the slippery ex-taillbacik, "but that’s
why I took an assistant coaching
job this spring under Len Casanova.
I've learned a lot about the T these
past weeks.”

Bimbo ‘does not think his lack of
height (5-7) will prevent him from

operating at quarterback. " Albert

As for competition from the brilli-

 Casanova was openly saying optimistic things about his team's
, future.

The rumor was not startling inso-
"far ,as,the chances of having a good
team were concerned, brit rather,

‘ , because a member ofthat institu-

tional clan, the football coaches of
America, was actually speaking
(optimistically. _
This I had to heat for myself. So
'I scooted up the mountain that sits

For example, you find that the
all-junior backfield can pour it on
when it comes to speed. The boys
are the kind who never miss a

but by no means a slow man, either.

"Bobby Bestwick is at the top
of the quarterback list right now.”

says Casanova. “Perhaps he’s not
a natural at the position, but he’s
willing 5 take orders and he has
a fierce determination to make
good.”

All in all, the Panther backfield,
which was commonly expected to
present Casanova with his most
painful headache, seems to add up
to anything except. a bust.

Yet, as Len Casanova says,

there is still a lot to be learned.

Coed Show

Has Humor

   

Hilarity (should be the keynote
from the time the curtain goes up
on the Pitt Players production of
"Connecticut Yankee” until the
show is over. “Yankee”, the first
coed musical to be presented at
Pitt, will be shown in Foster Me-
morial May 18, 19, 20, and 25, 26,
27. ‘

Such well-known tunes as "My
Heart Stood Still” and "Thou
Swell” are from the Rodgers and
Hart score created especially for
the Mark Twain story.

The current production is slated
to be one of the most‘ involved and
technical of those presented by the
Players this year.

Backing up Director Harvey J.
Pope will be five other directors
taking care of different phases of
work. Special help will be needed
in the fields of music, choral, dan-
cing, technical, and costuming.

Robert L. Arthur, director of
bands and orchestra at Pitt, will
serve as musical director. Ben
Benack, assistant to Arthur, will
be choral director.

Dancing will be directed by Mrs.
Rose Mukerji, instructor at Falk
School. ‘Technical director is
Robert Prendeville. Norma Reno
will design thevcostumes.

The essence of the "Yankee” is
the transportation to ancient Came-
lot of the hero, Martin, played by
Orrin S. Champer,, with an enlisted
Wave, Fay, played by Marjorie
Cohen, and a Wac, played by Shir-
ley Long.

There he poses as a magician
and wins the blessings of the
people in his new role as "the
Boss.”

At the end of the play, Martin
wakes up to find that the whole
episode in Camelot with‘ King
Arthur has been a dream.
