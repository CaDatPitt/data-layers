United Faculty fights
dismissal of petition

By George Kresak
Opinions Editor

The United Faculty will soon be ap-

’ pealing the decision by hearing ex-

aminer Elliot Newman of the Penn-
sylvania Labor Relations Board to
dismiss its petition for a collective
bargaining election, according to
United Faculty President Philip Wion.
Wion said the United Faculty “intend-
ed to file an appeal, probably some
time this week," before the deadline
of Feb. 3, extended from the original
deadline of Jan. 23.

l The PLRB dismissed the United
Faculty’s petition for having failed to

“We believe the faculty
of the University of Pitts-
burgh wants and deserves
a vote on collective
bargaining. We will not go
away. ”

— Philip "Wion

submit the required authorization cards
from 30 percent of the faculty in the
bargaining unit. But Wion and the
United Faculty contend that, by their
estimates, the necessary number of
authorization cards was indeed submit-
ted, and the United Faculty will base
its appeal on this ground.

Newman ruled last-October that the
bargaining unit to be considered in the
vote for collective bargaining be com-
prised of all Pitt faculty members, not
just the tenured full-time and pa1“t—time
faculty the United Faculty sought to
represent in its original petition. Wion
said that after the expansion of the

‘¢.?l.€?{.Ctl?i§3.;1.il.l¢.-».--:.-  . .. 

   

 

bargaining unit, he and the United
Faculty were led to believe that the total
number of faculty on the list was ap-
proximately 2,240. The United Facul-
ty was never given access to the list,
although it had requested to see it,
Wion said.

In December, the United Faculty

submitted 274 new authorization cards, ,

adding to the 506 it had previously sub-
mitted in January of 1984 prior to the
expansion of the bargaining unit. Wion
explained that the United Faculty was
told that the original submissions were
still valid and that with the addition of
the new authorization cards, the United
Faculty had produced a total of 780
authorization -cards —— more than
enough to satisfy the 30 percent
requirement.

Wion said, “The United Faculty was
never told how many valid authoriza-
tion cards were submitted, only that it
was not the required 30 percent.” He
suggested a number of explanations for
what the United Faculty contends is a
discrepancy. It’s possible, said Wion,
that either the PLRB miscounted the
valid authorization cards submitted or
that the PLRB had changed the ground‘
rules of what constituted a valid
authorization card or expanded the
bargaining unit without informing the
United Faculty. PLRB hearing ex-
aminer Newman could not be contacted
for a response.

Should the United Fac’ulty’s appeal
be unsuccessful, Wion said, “the
United Faculty‘ would file a new peti-
tion for a vote on collective bargain-
ing and be ready to submit fresh
authorization cards. ” He added, “We
believe the faculty of the University of
Pittsburgh wants and deserves a vote
on collective bargaining  We will not
go away.”

This artist’s rendition depicts Children’s Hospital’s new Main oer, which was dedicaed last

I it Friday ata ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Children’s opens ‘.Main Tower’   —,

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

The new Main Tower of Children’s
Hospital was officially christened Fri-
day morning in a ribbon cutting
ceremony. The 92 million, 12 story
facility, will eventually house all pa-
tient beds, a rooftop helipad, the inten-
sive care unit and various other
amenities. According to public relation
officials, ’ the tower’s central
laboratories and radiology imaging
complex will be shared by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh hospitals.-

On hand for the ceremony was a host
of dignitaries, including Pittsburgh
Mayor Richard Caliguiri, Mrs.
Richard Thornburgh (wife of the Penn-
sylvania governor) and Fred Rogers,

ty. In his remarks, Caliguiri said he
was “very pleased that the tower ex-
ists”and that the facilities are another
reason why “our city is No. l.” The
mayor pointed out that although the city
did not directly fund the project, it was
nonetheless involved.

“We’ve [the city] helped to raise
some money [for the Tower project],”

Caliguiri said. “We’ve been involved»

in the zoning and the planning.”

The costs of the new tower have been
incurred by Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh, Presbyterian-University
Hospital and the Health Center
Development.

Children’s Hospital’s President Ed-
win K. Zechman Jr. spoke of the Main
Tower project in relation to the goals
of his institution.

A landscaping worker was injured
Friday after hitting an electric service
line with a digging bar while digging
a hole in front of the Cathedral of
Learning.

The worker, Timothy Graf, was im-
mediately taken to Presbyterian-

University Hospital and was admitted, ,

according to hospital spokesman
Thomas Chakurda. Graf’s condition
was unknown, but Chakurda said the
injuries were not serious. Graf was
released Saturday.

The accident occurred Friday at
about 1:15 p.m. when Graf and other

workers from McKinley Landscape‘

Nursery, Inc. were digging post holes
in front of the Cathedral, an uniden-
tiﬁed worker said. After Graf dug
down about two feet, his digging bar

struck a 4,160-volt electrical service‘

line which then sent electricity through
his body. After a small explosion, the

remarked. “Now, we have the facil-

ities and the resources to do just that.” _ » H

R. Banks Smith, chairman of the
board of trustees, commented as well
on Children’s Hospital’s commitment
to the area’s young. According to
Smith, The Tower is representative of
a “rededication to child care excellence
in the city of Pittsburgh.”

F riday’s ceremony was the culmina-
tion of many years of hard work. Ac-
cording to Public Relations assistant

director Lynn McMahon, the idea for I

the tower first came about in the mid-
’60s. She notes, although, that the pro-.
ject was not officially begun until Oc-
tober, 1982. ‘ '

McMahon expects the facility to be
in use by mid-February. The majority
of patients are expected to be settled in
by March.

As a result of the damage to the ser-
vice line, electricity in several buildings
on campus, including the campus
bookstore and the Cathedral,
automatically went off. In the
Cathedral, classes were disrupted for
the rest of the afternoon and the
building was eventually closed.

Physical Plant director Richard

,McLellan said Friday that he did not

yet know the extent of the damage or
the cost for repairs. However, he did
say the line may have to be replaced.

Building maintenance director Ken-
neth Soergel, after surveying the area
where the accident occurred, said the
worker was lucky he wasn’t hurt more
than he was. “IfI was him, I’djust go
straight to church,” Soergel said.

‘Sun City’ explanation
to be shown at WPU

By Teresa Candori
For The Pitt News

Students for a Free South Africa
together with the Pitt Program Coun-
cil plan to show the video “The Mak-
ing of Sun City” Tuesday, Jan. 28, in
the William Pitt Union.

The 45-minute video will be shown
in the video room at one hour intervals
beginning at 10 a.m. and lasting until
8 p.m.

“The Making of Sun City” recounts
the efforts of Little Steven and Artists
United Against Apartheid to record the
song and film the video “Sun City.”
Little Steven, who wrote and record-
ed “Sun City,” speaks of his inspira-
tion for the project. He was initially
motivated by a song entitled “Biko,”
written and recorded by Peter Gabriel.

The video touches briefly on the life
of Steven Biko, a leader of the non-
violent Black Consciousness Move-
ment in South Africa, allegedly beaten
to death by police. The song inspired

Little Steven to travel to South Africa.

where he spoke with leaders of the anti-

apartheid movement and became com-
mitted to working to end apartheid.

The video features interviews with
members of Artists Against Apartheid,
who recorded the album “Sun City.”
The force that led the artists to band
together was a boycott of the South
African resort called Sun City, which
has been accused of being a propagan-
da device for the racist South African
government.

Ringo Starr, one of the artists in the
video, tells of how he first became
aware of the situation at Sun City 20
years ago when the Beatles were
asked to play there. Other artists who
are interviewed in the video are Lou
Reed, Bruce Springsteen and Bono of
U2.

The interviews are interspersed with
scenes from the video and clips of the
artists performing. The video for the
song. which is shown in its entirety at
the end of “The Making of Sun City”
includes actual footage of the situation
in South Africa. Members of the South
African band Malpoets characterize the
impact of the Sun City project: ‘-‘We
need to be on this album — we don’t
care if we have to die.”

Yo, Pilgrims

None can deny that acts of terrorism pose a grave '

challenge to world leaders. Short of condemning
the horror and menace of terrorism and those who
undertake it, there is little that can be done im-
mediately to end the crimes perpetrated by the PLO
and other responsible groups. As world leaders puz-
zle over ways to protect the lives of citizens from
terrorists, they are continually greeted by failure
and frustration.

This is particularly galling to a man of President
Reagan’s disposition. A swaggering throwback to
the likes of John Wayne, Reagan is loathe to
negotiate from any but a position of strength and
superiority. Refusing to admit the vulnerability of
the United States to a band of troublesome “kooks’ ’
and “ﬂakes,” he has sought far and wide for a
target to bully about, one that could be held
singularly culpable for all the outrages that forth-
right Americans have had to endure. And 10, he has
succeeded in his quest, identifying, a particularly vile
and nasty antagonist in Libya’s Col. Moammar
Khadafy. But is Khadafy anything more than a con-
venient target, a particularly opportune scapegoat?
Such would seem to be the case. For all his bellicose
posturing, Khadafy’—s role in international terrorism
would seem to be quite minimal. .

So while Mr. Reagan thumps his chest and
vociferates in righteous indignation, howling ex-
ecrations at Khadafy and his schemes, the real cause

of terrorism remains unaddressed. There is no visi- A

ble evidence that the Reagan administration has
made even the most perfunctory attempts to bring
Arab and Israeli leaders to the bargaining table. Mr.
Reagan seems to have forgotten that at the root of
the turmoil in the Middle East is the dispute between
these two groups. He would do well to remember
that, above all, Khadafy is an opportunist. He more
than welcomes the notoriety that Mr. Reagan has
so obligingly bestowed upon him.

Letters to the Editor

More Evil Russians

I am a loyal Pitt News reader and I
usually ﬁnd it very entertaining. I never
fail to get a chuckle out of my favorite
section, Opinion. I especially like the
column on the far left (no pun intend-
ed), the one and only article in large
print, because your opinion is more im-
portant than anyone else’s. A

Your editorial of Wednesday, Jan.
22 wasn’t quite as amusing as your
usual nonsense. You hit the nail square
on the head this time (just joking of
course). Seriously, though, that sort of
absurd garbage is less than
professional.

How’s this for logic — “Peace
through Weakness.” Our defense
budget may be bloated, but our
defenses certainly aren’t.

But, you declare we don‘t need to
spend so much on defense because the
Soviets merely wish to insure their own
survival. Perhaps you haven’t leafed
through Gorbachev’s manifesto. He
restates the goal (a goal which must be
millions of years old, surely you’ve
heard by now) of a world united under
communist rule. Keeping a straight
face, say the Afghanistans asked their
friendly Russian neighbor to help them
put down a revolt.

You suggest that the Soviet govern-
ment is not so evil. Come on
guys/girls, you’re talking about a
government that gives guns to
Khadafy. You might ask the citi_zens of

Eastern Europe if the Soviet govern-
ment is evil.

Please don’t declare me a victim of
the Rocky/Rambo syndrome. I’m not
even a’Republican.

Frats And Alcohol

Well, Nasos Georgiadis, so much for
elevating the Pitt frat man above the
“Animal House” stereotype. It is very
sad, but typical, that you feel alcohol
“governs your lives” and that you feel
so strongly about having it at your rush
parties. If you feel alcohol is that im-
portant maybe you should be speaking
to someone from AA and not just from
the Pitt administration.

Sandi Miller

Just Desserts

In the Jan. 17 Pitt News editorial en-
titled “Base Retribution,” it is claimed
capital punishment implicitly contains
an “immature emotional response -
a base desire for vengeance.” It goes
on to call capital punishment “juvenile,

errant impulse” that leads one to
“cringe in moral revulsion when made
to appreciate the grotesqueness of such
a horrifying procedure.”

I must take issue with this claim. It

seems to me that vengeance is not an-

emotion elicited by a system of justice
that executes capital punishments, but
is rather the result of a system that fails
to execute just punishment.

Humans have an intuitive sense of
justice that tells them the law should
punish criminals in proportion to the
crimes they commit. Naturally, the
gravest of crimes — murder —
deserves the severest of punishments.
This is not a bloodthirsty desire for
vengeance. It is only a recognition of
the importance of the rule of law in a
free and civil society.

In other words, citizens of a society
in which a murderer receives the same
sentence as a thief, and is soon back
in the streets, are not secure citizens.
If they feel justice is not being carried
out, they may feel the need for
vengeance.

Several closing points. First, capital
punishment is not murder. Murderers
kill innocent people, whereas capital
punishment kills murderers. Second,
the “system” cannot be compas-
sionate. Only people can be compas-
sionate. And finally, as for the sugges-
tion that proponents of capital punish-
ment attend an execution: Well, fine,
but only if you get tickets to the next
murder/rape of an 85-year-old lady.

Monday, Jan. 20, marked the
first national celebration of the
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King

Bill Cosby was there. dressed in
a collegiate sweatshirt. Elizabeth
Taylor appeared, dripping with
diamonds. Patti LaBelle, Diana
Ross. Lionel Richie and Kenny
Loggins performed. NBC's all—star
celebration of King‘s birthday was
truly a gala event.

Ronald Reagan made a speech
during the day. after declaring the
national holiday. Commercials
focusing on King’s stirring
speeches and his part in the history
of the civil rights struggle, were
aired throughout the weekend.

Indeed, the nation turned out to
honor one of the most inﬂuential
and charismatic men in history.

However, what did the average
American do to celebrate the na-
tional holiday? Watched the news
features, the television specials and
read the newsprint versions of
King’s career —— all very passive .
activities.

Perhaps this lack of active par-
ticipation in the holiday by every-
day citizens can be blamed on the
“apathy" of our time. Perhaps the
blame can be placed on the fact that
the holiday was (like most of our
celebrations) a bit too commercial.

To be sure. it was admirable to
see the celebrities use theirtalents
to promote the day and the man for

‘ whom it -was named. However, I

.. us to do on his birthday  make

‘ ‘Dream’ ’

feel that King would have wanted
more. 4

I think that King would have
wanted this generation to examine
the civil rights issues of the '60s and
reflect on how they have changed.
He probably would have urged us
to keep the movement going and to
ﬁght racism as well as sexism in the
’80s. King would have pleaded with
the citizens of the United States to
keep his dream alive.

’Most of the rhetoric used on
Monday was in the past tense. I
don't think that the civil rights bat-
tle is over. Yes, King achieved
much during his lifetime, but there
is still’ more to do. King‘s fight is
not behind us. It is constantly
before us — make a commitment
to pursue the dream.

I think that is what Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. would have wanted

a commitment.

Beyond Reason/Matthew Tolbertr

Have you heard the news? No wet
rush next fall! Really! No, I haven’t
read any official statements by Pitt or
the IFC in The Pitt News. But the
rumor is on every Greek’s lips: “The
university will not tolerate wet rushes

_ anymore!” Man, I bet Andy and Nasos

right now are after each other‘s throats!

Why am I complaining? The end of
wet rush will bring the downfall of
Pitt’s fraternities! See, the only way
Greeks can get people to come to rush
functions is by offering alcohol.
Rushees come to a fraternity house and
drink cheap beer while the brothers
look them over and spot a few poten—
tial members. They offer these rushees
a bid. If the rushees accept — the
alcohol helps here — boom! The frater-
nity has a new member in the club! No
alcohol, though, and you have no one
showing up to your party and, logical-
ly, no one to offer a bid to. Your frater-
nity' dies from lack of new blood.

What kind of club? A drinking club?
Hey buddy, our fraternities do more
than that! We, ah, we — yeah, we have
fund raisers, and ah, we have — um,
socials so we can, ah, meet new
people.

       
 
  

Illegal? Sure, serving alcohol to

 minors is against the law. But rules

were made to be broken, right?
Besides, we’ve been breaking the law
for years. Why bother to change now?

Can fraternities attract people in
other ways besides with alcohol? Are
you crazy? No one goes to a fraternity
house unless there’s Heineken or Pur-

  

 I ple Punch. What else have we to attract

 

 them with? Heck, we never even

  
  

      
  
   
       
   
         
     

 
 

bothered holding rush functions until

 wet rush started. Dry rush is a waste.

I mean, how can you have a good time

' dry?

What do you mean, try sponsoring
dry activities? And having the brothers
actually converse with everyone who
comes to our functions? Hey pal, I’m
no socialite. Give me some grain and

and I'll have a ball. I need a good belt

or two of my friend J.D. to rap with g

the opposite sex and strut my stuff.
Besides,ﬁm activities? I‘m no kid. I'm
an adult! Says so right here on my
driver‘s license. And I’m a Greek! And
Greeks don’t play games during rush.
What kind of image would aﬁm place
to party give our fraternity?,My frater-
nity brothers do things differently now
at our parties compared to their days
in elementary school, like, ah, social
drinking, and, ah, well 

What! Come up with new rushing
techniques? How are we supposed -to
come up with new techniques when
they can’t include serving Blue Ribbon
or Iron City? Do I look like a creative
person? Besides, what can top a Booze-
Until-You—Bust-or-Barf night? What
am I, stupid? People don‘t want to do
anything at college but drink. Right?

No! Drinking isn’t the most impor-

tant thing in my life, or in my fraterni— _

ty’s goals. What’s more important to
me and my brothers is, ah, um. 

Immoral? What do you mean, I’m
immoral? Just because I play quarters
while watching .Marylin Chambers
videos?

Hey buddy, just leave me alone. I
can handle my own problems and my
life. Now get out of my way ‘cause I’m
late to an important party. I have to get
trashed tonight.

.Walter “Walt” Pos, fresh young
university representative for the IFC,
bounded into the IFC meeting 15
minutes late. “Hi guys!” he shouted
and waved, smiling Ultra Brite teeth
and swinging his briefcase onto the
speaker’s podium. “Have I got some
exciting new news for you from the big
boys upstairs!” .

Grumbles of “Big Brother” and “by
the ball bearings” echoed through the
room.

“After great discussion,” Walt ex-
citedly went on, “of two minutes, our
illustrious university leaders have come
to a policy conclusion about Greek let-

ters on sweatpants.” c

Pitt‘s fraternity representatives leaned
forward in their chairs

"By decree of the university, you are
now allowed to wear Greek letters on
sweatpants ONLY in the the Towers
Lobby laundry room and in the
stairwells of Holland Hall.” Walt
ﬂashed a big grin of pleasure about the
shock value of his presentation.

The room shook and erupted.

“What kind of crazy legislation is
that!" cried one representative.

“That’s worse then last week’s
regulation banning MTV in fraternity
houses until it’s approved by the Rev._
Jerry Falwell!" shouted another.

“No fair! No fair!" screamed
everyone else.

“No fair?" Walt yawned. “The
university administration, in its
ultimate wisdom, considers it very
equitable.”

“But we were never consulted!" ex-
claimed the IFC president.

“Never consulted?” said Walt.
“Who’s there to consult? This ruling
is for everyone’s mutual welfare."

“Then what good is the IFC if we
can’t discuss this matter?” the presi-
dent exclaimed.

“Hmmm,” thought Walt. “You’re
right. OK, go ahead and discuss it.”

For the next three hours fraternity
representatives stood up and gave elo-
quent speeches based on the deep-
rooted political and philosophical views
of our great society concerning why
Greeks should be able to wear Greek
.letters on their sweatpants everywhere.
When all had been said, Joe took the
podium again.

“Very well discussed. The new
policy, however, stays in effect
whether you like it or not.” And with
another famous-smile, Walt closed his

‘briefcase and danced out of the room,

leaving behind the speechless IFC, the

fraternity reps, their president and a

meek reporter from The Pitt News.
All 10 of them.

I a shadowy» place to relieve my nausea

Washington Post Writers I Group/Richard Cohen

At the conclusion of a traditional
year-end Te Deum Mass, Pope John
Paul II interrupted a homily on
“religious indifference” to once again
condemn terrorism. Palestinian suicide
squads had just struck at the Rome and
Vienna airports and the Pope, once a
victim of terrorism himself, was indig-
nant and horrified. His words were
clear and forceful but Vatican policy,
alas, is something else. It had yet to
establish normal diplomatic relations
with ‘Israel.

Seventy-nine governments recognize
Israel and have normal relations with
its government. The Vatican is not one
of them. Its apostolic delegate is ac-
credited to the mayor of Jerusalem but
not to the nation itself. The Vatican
makes such distinctions, it has told
Israel, no longer on religious grounds
(Pius ‘X once said, “Jews have
recognized our Lord; we cannot
recognize the Jewish people”), but
because the borders of the nation-are
not yet established.

That’s an understatement. The West
Bank and Gaza are occupied territories.
The Golan Heights has been annexed.
The capital, Jerusalem, once intended
to be an international city, is held by
Israel and claimed, at least in part, by
Jordan. It is beloved by all Islam,
Christianity and Judaism. If you forget
how thorny this one issue is alone, you
may lose your right hand.

Still, other nations manage to have
normal diplomatic relations with Israel.
Spain just became no. 79. Like most
of the others, it does not recognize
Israeli suzerainty over Jerusalem or, it
almost goes without saying, the West
Bank and Gaza. For that reason, it, like
the United States and most other coun-
tries, has located its embassy in Tel

. Aviv,.a_ciVty. uncon_testab1y.in.Israe1i ter-

ritory. Of the 79 countries with normal
diplomatic ‘relations with Israel, less
than a handful maintain embassies in
contested Jerusalem.

The refusal of the Vatican to join
those 79 may seem insignificant. After
all, we are talking about the Vatican —
108 acres in the middle of Rome. It has
no commerce worthy of the name and,
as Joseph Stalin cynically observed, no
(army) divisions either. What it has in
abundance is awesome moral standing:
When the home office of Roman
Catholicism speaks, the world listens.

And to some ears, what the Vatican
has been saying by withholding normal
relations with Israel is uncomfortably
close to what Arab extremists say. It
is a variation of the Israel-is-illegitimate
theme, another way of saying that the
legal title to Israel is clouded and —
who knows? — maybe even temporary.
It is this view of Israel as both illegal
and temporary that enables Yasir
Arafat to vow that, in the name of
humanity, he will limit terrorist opera-
tions to Israel and the occupied ter-
ritories — and then, presumably, wait
until a grateful world awards him the
Nobel Peace Prize.

To the chagrin-of Israel, the pope
met with Arafat. He had his reasons.
Palestinian nationalism is a reality, and
Arafat, by pronunciamento of the Arab
states, is its spokesman. But Israel is
a reality too, and no. matter what its
borders may eventually be, no matter
what the eventual disposition of the
West Bank or the solution to the heart-
break of the wandering Palestinian, it
remains a nation that is entitled to live
in peace. The solutionof territorial
disputes, even a solution to the Palest-
inian problem, does not require the
destruction of the state of Israel nor the

Vatican Suggests Israel Is A BanditNation

counters.

Of course the Pope knows that. He
knows, too, that full recognition of
Israel might pose some difficulties for
the Vatican in certain Arab and Third
World states — and maybe that, and
not uncertain boundaries, is the real
reason for the church's position. hen
I asked the Vatican Embassy here for
comment, it told me to submit my ques-
tions by mail and said it would respond
the same way.) But the experiences of
79 nations, including Egypt, prove that
these are not insurmountable
difficulties. ‘

The Pope’s denunciation of terrorism
was appropriate and forceful. But as
long as the Vatican treats Israel as
something other than a normal nation,
it lends support to those who say it is
an illegal nation —— a trespasser in the

Arab Middle East. The Pope’s words-

were fine, but if he really wants to be
heard he ought to treat Israel as no dif-
ferent from any other nation. Even in

Rome, action speaks louder than

words.

Correction: Contrary to the
last line of Friday’s editorial,
the report drawn from was not
specifically concerned with the
Department of Computer
Science. In addition, the report
in no way inferred that said
department is composed of poor
students.

Lack of
rebounds
key to Pitt
downfall

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

Old fishermen like to tell stories
about “the ones that got away.” But
even the most experienced storytelling
sportsman will have nothing on the
1986 Pitt basketball team. The Panthers
let another one off the hook Saturday
as St. John’s battled back from a
12-point second half deficit to down
Pitt 68-67.

Pitt played a whale ofa game in the
first half, hitting 76 percent of their
shots from the floor and playing their
most inspired 20 minutes of the season.
By the time the teams gave way to to
the Golden Girl ﬁoor show at halftime,
Pitt was in command, leading 40-28.

“We let one slip away,” Pitt coach
Roy Chipman said. “The key was we
just didn’t rebound in the second half,
especially on defense.”

The biggest reason Pitt didn’t re-
bound in the ﬁnal stanza was 6-8 and
wearing a red jersey with the number
21 emblazoned on the back: Walter
Berry made the boards his own. Berry

dominated the inside game, grabbing’

1 1 rebounds and scoring 34 points. Of
those, 22 came in the second half.

“Walter Berry was a great player to-
day,” St. J ohn’s' coach Lou Carnesecca
said. Louie might have added Berry has
been a great player all season, leading
the Big East in both scoring and
rebounding.

Before Berry, and his crew took over
in the final 20 minutes, it looked like

it was going to be Pitt’s day. The Pan-'

thers opened strong, ﬁring out to a 22-7
lead midway through the first half. St.

The Truth: 5

Berry may
be best ’in
the nation  

It was just three minutes into the sec-
ond half at Saturday’s Pitt-St. John’s

matchup at the Fitzgerald Field House. < 1

With Pitt dominating from the opening
tipoff, the Panthers were in control
with a 44-35 lead. It was truth or con-
sequences time for St. John’s.

It was Pitt who found “_the truth”
and by virtue received the conse-
quences. St. John's rallied from a

15-point deﬁcit behind Walter “Truth” 1

Berry, to nip the Panthers 68-67.
Pittgained the big lead virtue of
some very hot ﬁrst-half shooting and

by not stopping — but containing — St. I

John’s Berry. Berry, a 6-8 junior, was
frustrated in the first half and the open-
ing minutes of the second as he hit on
only six of his first 16 shots from_the
ﬁeld. Still, Berry had 14 points, but
tight defensive play by Pitt’s Charles
Smith and Keith Armstrong prevented
him from dominating, a‘ trait he has
used to burn opponents so. many times

“My shots kept rolling in and out,”
Berry said, “but I stayed with it.”

St. John’s realized Pitt could not
shoot 76 percent from the ﬁeld in the
second half as they did in the first and
thus continued with their offensive
game plan which was to move the ball
inside to Berry and let him do his stuff,

Pitt did cool off in the second half
— just as Berry heated up.

Providence hands it to Pitt, 96-71

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers were beaten
Saturday afternoon by a talented Prov-
idence Lady Friars team 96-71 in a Big
East conference game at Fitzgerald
Field House.

Pitt led 20-18 with 9:54 left in the
first half, but Providence outscored the
Lady Panthers 25-11 to take a com-
manding 43-31 lead at halftime. In the
second half, Providence forward Mary
Burke and center Britt King combined
for 24 points, taking Pitt out of the
game. The Lady Panthers could get no
closer than 64-50 with 10 minutes to
go. .
Head coach Kirk Bruce was obvious-
ly disappointed in his team’s perform-
ance. “Today we took three steps

backwards,” he said. “We just didn’t
get after it. We weren’t physical
enough and we backed down from
them. They pushed us around and we
didn’t retaliate in any kind of way.”

The loss dropped Pitt to 7-9 overall
and 3-6 in the conference. Providence

The difference at the foul line was

“They pushed us around and’ we didn ’t retaliate in any kind of way. ’

)

— Head coach Kirk Bruce

improved their record to 13-4 overall
and 7-2 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers lost the game on
the boards and at the foul line. Prov-
idence out-rebounded Pitt 46-38 and
the Lady Panthers could never get the
critical rebounds. As Bruce put it, “We
gave them too many second-shot op-

not so surprising, takingtinto account
the foul situation. Pitt was whistled for
27 fouls in the game, but Providence
only had 14 team fouls. Quite in-
teresting ﬁgures, especially consider-
ing the Lady Panthers were playing on
their home court. But Bruce wasn’t
about to use it as an alibi. “The of-

Forward Jane Plake and Tyner each
had nine rebounds for the Lady Pan-
thers. '

Providence had a balanced attack
which included six double-figure
scorers. Burke led the Lady Friars with
22 points, King had 21, guard Diann
Reynolds had 14, center Doreen

Ferguson had 13, guard Doris Sable
contributed 12 points and forward
Joanie Powers chipped in 10. Prov-
idence’s King led in rebounding with
13 boards, while.Ferguson added 10.

' “Providence has a nice ballclub,”
admitted Bruce. “They’re well
coached and they have some good
athletes. But I don’t think they are 25
points better than we are. Today they

The Pitt News. January 27. I986

Rowan’s homecoming successful

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Ron Rowan had the chance of a
lifetime on Saturday.‘ He was standing
on the foul line. with an opportunity to
end any hopes Pitt — the same team
he watched as he grew up in Beaver
Falls — had of winning the basketball
game.

The pressure was on. and Rowan
knew it. He calmly stepped to the foul
line and missed the first half of a one-
and—one. The possibility of being a goat
existed shortly but vanished quickly as
Demetreus Gore’s desperationjumper
looked more like a Mark Brasco field
goal attempt.

The game was over, St. John’s
escaped with a one—point. 68-67 win.
and Rowan escaped with his pride
intact.

“I just wanted to come in here and
do the bestjob I could,” Rowan said.
“I'm always glad when we come out
with a victory, but a win here makes
it a little more special.”—

Things have been special for Rowan
ever since he came to St. John's three
years ago. A 6-5 senior, Rowan spent
two years at Notre Dame. before
transferring to St. John’s.

Last year, his first year of eligibili-
ty at St. John’s, Rowan played a ma-
jor role off the bench as the Redmen
were regular season Big East Cham-
pions and went all the way to the Final
Four.

“I am real happy now at St. John’s,”
Rowan said. “Things were not right at
Notre Dame, but I really like where I
am at now.”

St. John’s guard Ron Rowan (12), a native of near- ‘

Wendy Isaacman/The Pitt News

 

by Beaver Falls, had 17 points against Pitt on

Saturday.
Another person who is happy that

Rowan is in New York is St. John’s V

head coach Lou Carnesecca.

Faced with the task of rebuilding
after the graduation of Chris Mullin,
Bill Wennington, Mike Moses and Ron
Stewart, Carnesecca has relied heavi-
ly upon Rowan to add some scoring
balance to an attack that is dominated
by Walter Berry. Rowan did just that
on Saturday. tossing in 17 points while
dishing out four assists.

“Ron really hit some big buckets for

us,” Carnesecca said. “He has been 

a major part of our offense all year
long.”

Rowan was the man that Carnesecca
wanted on the foul line for that crucial
last foul shot. A 91—percent free throw
shooter, Rowan had his chance.

“He’s the guy that is the great free
throw shooter,” Carnesecca said. “I’m
sure he didn’t plan on missing it. Jerry
West missed three in a row one time.”

“I missed that one, and I’m sure I‘ll
miss another one,” a confident Rowan
stated. “We won the game, and that
is all that matters.

Berry may be the best

continued from page 7

the lead at 49-48. And it was Berry
who did nearly all of the damage. Berry
scored atdozen in the run on a variety
of dazzling moves.

He scored on breakaway dunks,
IO-foot jumpers, and spin moves to the
hoop. When Berry’s teammates shot
and missed, it was Berry who grabbed
the offensive rebound and put it in.

“We couldn’t check Walter Berry on
the boards,” said Pitt coach Roy Chip-
man. “He must have had eight shots
off from offensive rebounds.”

And they all went in as Berry never
cooled off. In all, he scored 34 points,
22 points in the second half alone. He
also hammered the boards for 11 re-
bounds, with eight coming while he
was on offense. Just for insurance, he
added two block shots, two assists and

a steal.

“We worked hard to stop him,”
Armstrong said, “but he’s just a real
good player.”

In effect, Saturday was Walter Berry
Day in Pittsburgh. He virtually all by
himself stole a victory that was signed,
sealed and delivered to Pitt.

“There was no doubt in my mind we
would come back,” Berry said.
“When we were down 15 points, I
think I had to come out and take con-
trol because everyone was looking for
me to be the leader.”

Berry has adjusted well to becoming
the St. John’s leader. Last season, a
year in which the Redman went 31-4
and advanced all the way to the
semifinals in the NCAA, it was Chris
Mullen who received all the media
attention.

. . 4 ,-..,=';-‘, . 2 4w; .,_,, :«' .1 v:

I2 iPage:_?-I9 : 

This season, since Mullen graduated,
St. John’s was expected to fall to the
middle of the pack in the Big East
Conference. '

No such thing has happened. St.
John’s is off to a 19-2 start, good for
eighth in the nation in all the major
polls. And they are tied for first with
Syracuse in the Big East with a 6-1
record.

In the process, Berry has become not
only the star of the Big East but one
of the nation’s best forwards. When the
season ends, he will be a strong can-
didate, if the not favorite, for the Na-
tional Player of the Year Award.

Berry has led his team in scoring in
all but one game this season —— and he

leads with excitement. Every time‘

Berry touches the ball he is a threat to
shoot. He will shoot with his back to

the basket, he will shoot on double or
triple pumps — and he makes them._

“He has awkward moves,” Arm-
strong said. “You never know where

he’s gonna go next. He knows what he‘

wants to do with the ball, and if he
doesn’t, he creates something.”

Berry’s creative moves come from
the playground style he learned while
growing up in the Bronx section of
New York City. He averaged 17.0 per
game last season but was labeled the
same as Pitt’s Demetreus Gore —— too
wild. With the help of St. John’s coach
Lou Camcsecca, Berry has merged his
aggressive street behavior with
Carnesecca’s basketball patterns and
has become a much better player.

“Walter Berry is the best player
we’ve faced this season,” Chipman
said.

Pitt-St. J ohn’s

continued from page 7

John's was having trouble at both ends
of the court. hitting only 43 percent of
their shots while capturing just four
defensive rebounds.

Un_fortunately for Pitt, the rules re-
quire two halves be played.

“We played the same defense [in the
second halt]” Chipman stressed. “I
think we got pretty good shots, wejust
didn't rebound."

One reason Pitt had trouble in the
paint was the forced absence of Charles
Smith in the second half. Smith found
himself in deep foul trouble when his
fourth personal was called with over 15
minutes remaining. Pitt’s leading re-
bounder watched the next five minutes
from the bench.

“That hurt us deeply.” Chipman
said of Smith‘s foul difficulties. “He
is a very crucial player for us, especial-
ly against a team that plays man—to—man'
a lot, which St. John’s does. With

‘Smith out of the game, we just stopped

playing."
It was during that crucial ﬁve—minute
stretch without Smith that Pitt saw its

lead disappear into the smoke-filled

When Smith left the contest, Pitt was
still comfortably ahead 48-4l. Five
minutes later. they trailed 56-52.

After that, Pitt never regained the
lead. although it did tie the ballgame
three times in the final four minutes.

Ron Rowan put St. John’s up 68-66
with 1:06 left, but on Pitt's next posses-
sion he fouled Keith Armstrong, giv-
ing the Panther center a chance to tie
the game from the free throw line. But
Armstrong missed his first shot, and
sank the follow-up, to pull Pitt to within
a single point of the Redmen.

With St. John’s trying to run out the
clock, Pitt failed to commit a foul un-
til there were 11 seconds to go when
Armstrong finally bumped Rowan.

The Beaver Falls native missed his
free throw and the Panthers had a ﬁnal
trip downccourt to pull out a win. But
a shot by Demetreus Gore fell just short
of its target and Pitt, again, fell just
short of beating St. John’s.

“I feel bad,” Gore said after the

ttl’s Charles Smilys in two ‘points ‘over the

game. “We had a 14-point lead. Yeah.
I feel real bad. I don't know how to
assess us. I think we're better than our
record shows. We're not in a bad posi-
tion. but we could be better."

"We’re not dead," Chipman
reminded. “We didn't die today. We
lost to the No. 8 team in the nation. We
wanted to win. We thought we had a
good chance to win."

The Panthers are not in dire straits
yet, but they are 4-4 in the conference
with games against Syracuse, Villanova
and Georgetown looming on the near
horizon.
