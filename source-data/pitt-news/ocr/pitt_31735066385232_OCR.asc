”The University is rigorously
pursuing every legal means to
recover every penny owed,” said
Mary Ann Aug,

University Relations, in regard to
the alleged kickback scheme in-
volving Harry Musko.

Musko, the assistant manager

Director of '

cused of accepting at least
$4,000 monthly from Bertenthal
& Sons, Pitt's largest provider of
janitorial goods, in exchange for
payments from the University for
supplies that were not actually
delivered. I F

Musko was authorized to pur-
chase from Bertenthal, which has
done business with Pitt for at least
seventeen years, under a blanket
purchase order contract, the Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette reported.

’’In any situation where you
need an ongoing supply; of
materials, you use blanket pur-
chase orders,” said Aug. ”This is
common for any large organiza-
tion, including universities.”

_The blanket purchase order
contract ”is -afiniteycontract and
does not mean that you can

want,” she said.

Jackson opposes fifth consecutive tuition raise

By Stephanie Myers

_ Staff Writer

Student tuition has increased
during each ofthe last five years,
according to a letter Craig Jack-
son, president of the Student
Government Board, sent to
university Senate President Her-
bert Chesler. Jackson's letter
was sent to voice his disapproval
of the Senate's decision to raise
tuition again.

Jackson stated that his concern,
was the raising of students’ tui-
tions by 10 percent. '

At the Senate Council meeting

on Sept. 19, 1988, appropriations,

were decided to go first to pay for
the increases in faculty salaries.
The Senate was unsure of the
proportion of appropriations go-
ing toward financial aid.
Jackson feels that the state's ap-
propriations should benefit the

~ students as well as the faculty.

’’I am very distressed that the
students’ financial aid is not at

least being given equal treatment
with faculty salaries,” Jackson
said. ”Taking any more money
from [students] would be a gross
injustice." '

Jackson feels it odd that even

though the university as awhole

is trying to work to receive funds
from the state, some peopleare
actually ”trying to gobble up
more than they should get.”

Jackson believes that this will
increase students’ dislike for their
professors, knowing that the
professors are. overpaid and that
the students are losing money.

’’If this money is helping any
students, that's great, because
some students just have trouble
scraping up the money,” Jackson
said.

Jackson also explained that
once professors are tenured,

they're in for life, but if students »

can't get the money, they're out.
He feels that financial security of
the students is more on the line
than the professors’. I

This week Jackson also attend-
ed an ad hoc meeting on com-
puter usage, during which they
discussed problems of CAP ac-
counts.

In addition, many students are
having problems with their ac-
counts being, shut off without
notification. There is supposed to

I be a warning printed on the

screen when a student has used
75 percent of his allocated ac-
count. This is not done in all in-
stances, and it has caused much
grief to students who could not
get their programs done on time.

They also discussed opening
the David Lawrence computing
lab all night rather than keeping
the lab in the Old Engineering
Hall during this time. There is a
greater number of all types of
computers and software available
in David Lawrence that would
help more students get work
done.

Any student can receive a CAP
account with a $200 limit. After

the limit is exceeded, the student
must then access another ac-
count, which may take at least
three days.

If anyone has complaints about
this system he may call in or at-
tend the meeting next Wednes-
day at 1 p.m. I

”One way we are going to try

to tackle this problem is [by] get- .

ting students involved,” Jackson
said.

In other business, the Elections
Committee stated that there were
no more applications for w,rite—in
candidates, and it doesn't antici-
pate any. The committee requests
a lot of assistance from the com-
mittees at the voting polls.

, Endorsement Night will be
held on Oct. 31 at 7:30 p.m. in
suite 510 of the William Pitt Un-
ion. Meet the Candidates Night
will take place Nov. 2 in the

attempting torecover all money from fraud case

keys,” said’ John _J. Zagari,
Musko’s attorney, for the, Post
Gazette, describing Musko’s dis-

. missal from his University post.

The officials were also saying
to Musko, ”we want these” and
”we’re going to gather up your"
possessions,” said Zagari, ”and
that sounds a lot like a firing to
me.” I v

”Suspension withoutpay pend-~
ing resolution of the case is the
more appropriate response,” he
said. I

"’So far two individuals have
been suspended,” said Lewis M.
Popper, attorney for the Univer-
sity Counsel. ”Musko and
another who we cannot identify
since that individual has not yet-
been charged.” _

Bertenthal said that Musko
started demanding ”funds in
return for orders” in .1982. As the
demands increased, Bertenthal
no longer funded the payments to
Musko from his own pocket.

The plan was for Bertenthal to“
supply Musko with false invoices
which the University would pay.
Of these payments, Musko would
receive sixty percent, the rest for
Bertenthal.

”We have a very strict purchas-
ing department,” said Aug. ”All

Casey administration took liberties with ruling in 1982}

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ The 8

Pennsylvania Supreme Court said
the Casey administration mis-
takenly broadened a narrow
1982 ruling to justify scheduling
two state judicial elections for
Nov. 8.

The opinion released Tuesday
explained a one—paragraph deci-
sion Sept. 27 canceling the elec-
tions for a seat on the state
Supreme Court and one on the
state Superior Court. The ruling
affected four candidates, two for
each seat.

The decision also apparently
extended the terms of Superior
Court Judge James R. Melinson
and Supreme Court Justice Juan-
ita K. Stout, appointed by Gov.
Robert P. Casey to replace two
judges who retired in 1987.

The appointments were sched-
uled to expire in January, when
the newly elected judges would
take office.

”The terms of the appoint-
ments will have to be amended
to reflect the dictates of our state
constitution,” the court said.

Philadelphia attorney Richard
A. Sprague filed a lawsuit Aug. 17
to stop the elections. He pointed
to a section of the constitution
that requires judicial elections in
odd-numbered years to avoid the
distractions of presidential cam-

paigns.

The Casey administration
pointed to a previous Supreme
Court ruling that allowed a judi-
cial election in 1982.

PACs represent business and

Parkinson's disease: no cure, but help can be found»

By Jarrett Altdorfer
For The Pitt News

John was a well-respected,
40-year-old teacher, husband and
father. But something was wrong.
In the beginning, only his left arm
trembled. Over time, John lost
more control of his body, and his

.speech became slurred. Eventu-

ally, John was diagnosed as hav-
ing Parkinson’s disease. John was
embarrassed, ashamed and
confused. -

But John was not alone, nor
was he resigned to a bitter fate.
Harry Truman, Mao‘ Tse Tung
and Francisco Franco are
renowned historic figures who
suffered from Parkinson's.

In the United States alone, Par-
kinson’s has claimed over a mil-
lion victims. More people suffer
from Parkinson's than multiple

sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou
Gehrig's Disease) combined.

Nancy Kosanovich, a nurse
specialist in the department of
neurology at the University of
Pittsburgh, lectured yesterday on
the disease, telling her audience
that Parkinson's is really a closet
disease.

”The easiest thing is to sit
around and feel bad. Patients
need to keep going and push
themselves,” she said.

Parkinson's Disease is a com-
mon disorder of the brain. It is the
degeneration of neurons in the
part of the nervous system which
controls movement, posture,
balance and walking. This
damage produces the primary
symptoms: rigidity, slow move-
ment, postural instability and
tremors. Minor symptoms may

include depression, slurred
speech, difficulty in swallowing,
drooling, impotence and consti-
pation. .

The cause of Parkinson's is
unknown, and there are no
specific tests to determine its
presence. A diagnosis is based on
the evaluation of symptoms
resulting from a neurological ex-
amination. Several rating scales
determine the severity of Parkin-
son's Disease. Each scale has
stages by which the physician
evaluates the disease.
range from mild (no visible dis-
ease) to advanced (complete im-
mobility.)

Medical treatment is used as
the patient’s symptoms worsen.
Drugs are introduced in accor-
dance to the progression of the
disease. Levodopa (L—dopa) is an
important treatment for sym-

Stages .

ptoms of Parkinson’s and is the
most effective anti—Parkinson’s
drug. Over time, L-dopa’s
benefits begin to dissipate. In ad-
dition, there are side effects, such
as hallucinations.

In the past, surgery was often
used to treat Parkinson's patients.
The operation, which placed a
freezing probe in the part of the
brain called the thalamus, was ef-
fective in relieving only tremors
and rigidity. Recently in Mexico,
China and Sweden, scientists be-
gan transplanting human fetal
cells into Parkinson»,s patients.

Kosanovich said this procedure
is not a cure and raises controver-
sial ethical issues.

Physical exercise has been
proven to have a major role in the
management of Parkinson's pa-
tients. Regular exercise together
with good medical treatment can

increase mobility, improve bal-
ance, improve coordination and
increase independence.

Kosanovich said that a good fit-
ness program consists of exercise
at least three times a week. Pa-
tients must remain active while
standing, sitting, or lying down.

Ken is Kosanovich’s star pa-
tient. Diagnosed with Parkinson's
Disease in 1976, his physical and
mental condition is superior to
that of most Americans. Ken
walks two hours every day. He
uses Nautilus machines at a local
gym three times a week and does
floor exercises on other days.
Ken's weight is 170 pounds,
down from 240. Mentally, he
maintains a positive attitude. Hu-
mor replaces anger and
depression.

Whales are
on verge of
freedom in
Alaska

By Bruce Bartley

Associated Press Writer

BARROW, Alaska — Super-
power -saviors were close to
opening a path to the sea for two
trapped whales Wednesday after
Soviet icebreakers bashed
through an ice ridge and Ameri-
cans hacked iceholes toward the
Russians.

The whales ”are acting in a
very excited manner, almost like
they can sense freedom,” said
Sgt. Ian Robertson, spokesman
for the Alaska National Guard.

At first light, the Soviet
icebreakers were a half—mile from
the line of breathing holes being
cut by Americans working in the
opposite direction, he said.

Later Wednesday, rescuers
planned to use a gargantuan,
tractor—like device propelled by
pontoon augers to cut the rela-
tively thin ice remaining between
the whales and the icebreakers’
farthest advance. .

Rescue coordinator Ron Morris
of the U.S. National Oceanic and

Atmospheric Administration said.

the whales could be free by late
Wednesday if all went well. The
weather_ was a ”positively
balmy” —— 5 degrees Fahrenheit,
Robertson said.

The breakthrough in the effort
to free the migrating gray whales
caught in an early freeze came af-
ter more than a week of delays
and disappointments.

”We feel very good about it,”
said Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen
of NOAA. ”The cooperation has
just been fantastic. The Soviets
came in here with a very positive
attitude and went to work im-
mediately.’’

On Tuesday, the Americans
moved the huge mammals
around a shoal that had stymied
progress for three days. Eskimos
with chain saws cut a detour in
the ice so that the whales could
swim around the shallow water
they had refused to pass.

When the Eskimos started cut-
ting the air holes, the whales ”fol—
lowed the water right to the end.
They like that deeper water,”
Petersen said.

. One priest's action
  has effect on many

Two weeks ago, a priest was arrested for sexually as-‘
saulting two young boys, and the implication of this inci-
dent has shaken priest and citizen alike.

It is tragic that the actions of one man can affect a whole
organization. Priests hold a particularly high place in our

. society, especially in a moral sense. They are often the

most involved people in the community. .

But now, priests have reservations, as might some
citizens. "The assumption is no longer, ’Isn’t it nice to see
a priest with those young boys?’ I think every priest is
aware of that,” said Bishop Anthony Bosco in yesterday's

Pittsburgh Press.

It must be stressed that priests are as human as every-
one else; that they are thought of as 'ho|ier’ than most peo-
ple makes an incident like this stand out even more.

Hopefully, people will realize that the priest involved
in this incident does not reflect the way other priests be-
have and will continue to give the other priests the respect

I have a cold.

This past weekend, I stood out-
side in the torrential downpours
that plagued our proud city and
shouted at the top of my lungs.
Consequently, I became sick.

"Were you at Homecoming?”
I was asked by some friends.

”No,” I replied, ’’I was at
another all-American event.”

"What could be more Ameri-
can than watching the home
team wallop the hell out of the
adversaries on Homecoming
weekend?”

"I was at a political rally," I
said.

"Oh," they said, ”that's too
bad about your cold, but you'll
get that if you stand outside in the
rain."

They walked away shaking

their heads as if it were a

ridiculous thing to go to a rally in

the rain.

I stood outside for a principle
and, well, I'm still sick, but that's
all right. At least there is some
comfort in knowing that there are
5,000 other people who did the
same thing, and I'll wager that

While the latest issue of Roll-
ing Stone magazine features an
article proposing that the AIDS
”crisis" among heterosexuals has
been greatly exaggerated, this
November's issue of Spin isn't
taking any chances.

This issue of the rival magazine
will contain aifree Trojan con-

- dom with "explicit” instructions

for proper use.

Bob G.GuccioneJr. said: "We
are making a statement to our
young adult readership.  It is an
immensely important and respon-
sible statement —— that safe sex
can save lives.”

Condomania has taken over
the United States. His and her
towels have been replaced by
Trojans for him and Trojans for
her.

‘ Appalled at the thought of a
purported life-saving device? Ap-
palled at the thought of a device

. designed in the hopes that some-

day, a man, woman or child will
not waste away, die of pneumo-
nia, tuberculosis or any other

I AIDS-related disease?

”Our customers didn't want
it," is what the general manager
of a distributing company said. I
don't know the exact readership
of Spin, but it is pretty obvious
that it is a magazine whose
majority of readership would not
be offended.

It is absolutely absurd that

and thinki

half of them have colds too.

You might be asking yourself-,
you who have no rally ex-
perience, ”Why stand out in the
rain and scream?”

Why, indeed. I mean, the can-
didate probably never saw or
heard me among the rest of the
masses that congregated in his
honor. He also had an umbrella
and secret service men to keep
him comfy.

, Well, ye of football, concert
and parade experience probably
know the feeling of unity that
comes with a crowd that is
gathered for the same purpose. I
guess that's why I and those other
silly people stood out in the rain.
However, there is something

different about "unity" when you '

cross over into the dark and mud-
dy waters of politics.

You could sit right next to a
Democrat or a Republican (or,
egads, someone else) at a Pitt

many of the drugstores which are
protesting the free condom actu-
ally sell condoms.

That is almost as ironic as the

convenience store, 7-Eleven,
which chose not to sell maga-
zines that contained nudity any
longer — and then adopted the
slogan "Freedom of Choice.”
Which brings up the old adage

FRANCES
SANSIGI

— if they know there's a condom
inside, they can choose not to
buy it.

Guccione's efforts will most
likely drown in all the other
hoopla surrounding AIDS. I fore-
see the only press he'll get will be
a few small articles on the back
pages of newspapers and a plug
on MTV, but you never know.

Even so, those who proclaim
their disgust with the Spin con-
doms are being petty and ig-
norant, and more often than not,
are not readers of Spin magazine.

One clear indication of that is
the general manager's statement:
"We checked with the supermar-
ket and convenience store chains
and other outlets. ..."

But did they check with the
customers? Yes, she said, "Our
customers didn't want it." But she
did not say customers of Spin

magazine.
Spin boasts a monthly circula-

tion of 140,000, which is evi- ‘

dence enough to me that only
140,000 people will receive a
condom, which means that mil-
lions of others won't, so what are
store owners complaining about?

How could a condom, tucked
away neatly in a magazine,
offend anyone who chosenot to

pick it up, leaf through it and

look?

So, most places you could buy »

the magazine, you can buy a con-
dom. Most people know there
are condoms in drugstores, super-
markets, etc., but they don't get
offended every time they go into
a drugstore or supermarket. So
what's the difference if you know
there is a condom in a magazine?
The fact is, theyknow condoms
exist. What these protesters are
saying, in effect, is that they are
appalled that condoms exist.

Children's possible access, is
one issue, but cooperative store
owners will probably tape the
magazine shut, like many do with
pornographic material.

"Our inclusion of the condom
is an emphatic message,” said
Guccione.

As Marshall McLuhan once
said, the medium is the message.
But I bet he never had this in
mind.

ng of strange things

game and not even know it, and
it really doesn't even matter be-
cause everyone knows politics
have no role in athletic events.

However, try standing in a
large room (take the lobby of the
WPU) and shout out some polit-
ical propaganda and then see
how many friends (and enemies)
you can make in five minutes.

Election time is fun  it allows
those of similar convictions to
unify. Instead of reading the
news, we make it with our
marches, parades, posters and
commercials.

We get instant friends (just add
convictions and presto, change-o:
instant a|lies!!). We also get ins-
tant enemies (try writing columns
for The Pitt News). On top of it
all, we get nifty buttons and neon
signs to flash proudly to un-
suspecting folk.

Political affiliation is also a
wonderful excuse for having par-

ties which re—affirm our faith. We
stand around the hors d’oeuvres
table and the keg; we speak of
wonderful times to come, or the
continuation of the wonderful
times we've been having.
However, I'm glad that it will
all be over soon. Eitherimy guy
or the other one is going to take

‘office, and then we can go back

to being anonymous. I won't
have to tell my roommates to turn
down the stereo when the news
comes on, and I won't have to
stand out in the rain, ripping my
vocal cords apart.

I can either sleep easily for the»

next four years, or I can toss and
turn in my bed, anticipating the
next time I get to call people from
the phone banks and ask them,
”Will you be voting in this elec-
tion, sir, ma’am or mzzz? And for
whom?”

Hopefully by then, I'll get rid
of this miserable cold.

FRIDAY NIGHTS THIS FALL

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 27, I988

By Tim Azinger

Assistant Showcase Editor

Tracking down Thin White
Line is a tedious task. Luckily, I
meet Dale McQuade (drums) on
the doorstep of Bob Porter's (vo-
cals) house, where the band
practices.

Dale was in the same «predica-
ment I was: he couldn't findthe
rest of the band.

A trip down Chesterfield Road
to Sharon Fredricks’ (bass) house
produces no results. Sharon is the
newest member of the band, but
she never does show up for the
rehearsal.

-On our return trip up the hill,
we bump into Charles Rosen-
blujm (saxophone). Still finding
no one home, we pile into
Charles’ old, grey ”boat” and
proceed to the Luna, a favorite
band hangout.

Sure enough, we find Bob
there and trek back to the house,

» where we find Jason Bakes (gui-
‘ tar) and Tim Dunleavy (guitar),

who had broken in through the
front window. ’

. Finally, we all squeeze into the
kitchen and position ourselves
around the cubicle ‘table. The
house is a perfect example of a
striving band's rehearsal pad. It's
slightly cluttered to say the least.

”This is nothing,” saysPTim.
”This looks like Home and
Garden compared to what it used
to be.”

It's a furious interview session.
I throw out questions and then
tediously sift through the barrage
of answers that assault me from
all sides. I

Dale quietly sits beside me and
nods his agreement to the others’
statements. He ocasionally adds
his own, barely audible
responses.

Jason excitedly rifles questions

of his own at me. ”Do you like

my tattoo? Don't I know you from»

somewhere? Do you do drugs?
Did you see that movie Prince of
Darkness?”

I simplyshrug my shoulders
and continue down my list of
questions.

”Thin White Line has had
numerous incarnations since
1985,” says Tim. ”This incarna-
tion has been together for about
a year and a half.”

”Thin White Line is sort of the
Shirley MacLaine of bands,” adds
Charles.

The best way to describe Thin
White Line's style is to start with
a base of rock ’n’ roll and then
add every item that exists in the
musical realm. I

”We play rock ’n’ roll with or-
ganized mania,” says Tim. ”Our
favorite description is [that] we're
Otis Redding fronting the Sex
Pistols.”

As for influences, take your
pick. There are probably very few
that aren't on Thin White Line’s
list.

”You’ve got five people that
are all into different music,” says
Tim. ”Bob came up on R&B and
blues and then got heavilyinto
rock’n’roll. I was heavily in-
fluenced by punk and the avant-
garde of the late’70s, like Roxy
Music. Dale likes the real
psychedelic and electronic stuff.
Jason, he likes everything from

‘ Rush to the Swans. We take the

whole gamut of rock. We like
everything.”
Diverse characters accompany

the band’s intricately different
personal preferences.

”We’re the KKK’s dream,” says
Tim. ”We’ve got Negroes, Jews,
Catholics; we've got ’em all.”

While original flavoring persists
in their music, the band does
have 15 covers that they use at
various times.

”A lot of them are unrecogniz-
able though,” says Charles.

”What we've unconsciously
done,” adds Tim, ”is taken a lot
of things that people might recog-
nize and put them together in our
own fashion.”

When on stage, a frenzied, dy-
namic show is the ultimate goal
for the band. They want the au-
dience to be just as involved’ as
they are.

”On stage, we're. like Andy ..

Gibb on acid,” says Charles with
a sarcastic grin;

”When we play,” Tim adds,

”the only thing we strive for is
energy, to get the audience as
psyched as we are.”
‘ Thin White Line is also concen-
trating on making their material
available to the public. With one
tape, Dock of the B-usstop, on
Brainthrust, already out, the band
is looking forward to more
recording;

”We’re looking for another a|— .

bum or cassette to come out
around Christmas,” says Bob.
”Right now, our videos are com-
ing to the front.”

Currently, Thin White Line's
first video ”Strange Glances,”
can be seen on Tri—State Videos,
which is aired here in Pittsburgh:

Work on the ”Pink Dots from
Mars” video is underway and a
half—hour |ive,lThin White Line
video is due to be released within
the next two weeks. ,

After finishing the formal busi-
ness, it’s off. to the basement to
practice. Rehearsal must go on,
despite the absence of a bass
player. This doesn’t seem to
bother the rest of the band.

The basement is theepitome of
the house's disarray. Amplifiers
are precariously stacked around
the room. Dale's drums are hid-
den away under the stairs. This is
where he likes to play.

The floor is scattered with emp-

ty beer cans, broken glass,

cigarette butts, paper scraps and
used spit cups.
”I like to chew a lot when we

practice,” says Jason, opening a

new can of Copenhagen.

A mad half hour search ensues
for an extension cord. Without
electricity, equipment just won't
work.

Practice finally begins. It’s all
ecstatically intense. Judging from
the vigor I felt from this simple
basement jam, I can only assume
what they would be like in front
of a crowd. ‘

Bob spews forth lines of cool,
marshma||ow—thick vocals, oca-
sionally breaking into high-

'pitched primal screams. His

bluesy voice harmoniously con-
trasts the band’s rugged guitar
rhythms.

Charles breaks into wailing sax
solos to accompany Tim's guitar
leads.

”We’re tired of this cliquish
sh——t,” says Bob. ”We play mus-
ic for everyone. We want people
to support local music.”

Thin White Line will be play-
ing at Club Concourse this Friday
night. The band extends an invi-
tation to everyone.

Michael makes a
cutting comeback

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

The shape. The face. The
house. The night. The sequel.
The turkey.

Hol|ywood’s resurgence into
the horror film genre over the last
decade has undoubtedly
spawned a new staple for the
movie industry’s ever-changing
diet, one which traditionally
binges on the proverbial Mean-
Ugly—Dude—With-A—Mother—
Fixation—Who—Cho‘ps-Up-
Teenagers—For-Fun—With—/\-
Power—Saw type, adding new and
exciting dimensions to movie di-
alogue and riveting, Oscar-
nominated performances from
California's leading stunt men.

And of course, movie—goers are
incessantly reminded that these
fine feature films are flourishing
at the box office. Big buck bad-
dies from the 19405 and 505, like
Frankenstein's monster, Dracula,
and the Wolf Man, have been
replaced by the bone-chilling Su—
per Slashers of the 19805: Jason,
Leather—Face,' Freddy Krueger
and, of course, your friend and
mine, Michael Myers.

But unlike his episodic col-
leagues, Mike hasn't chopped a
finger in about 10 years, and for
a while he remained mercilessly
incarcerated in a custom—made
video store straight-jacket. But
now he's back in the theater, and
he's badder and deffer than ever

‘in Halloween 4: The Return of
Michael Mvers. ,

Now a cursory summary for all
you late—comers: In 1963 on Hal-
loween night, 6-year-old Michael
Myers hacked up his older sister
Judith with a butcher knife in the
little town of Haddonfield, lll.

Mommy and Daddy Myers came ,

home and locked him up for
good in Smith Grove and that
was the end of that. Or so they
thought. ‘

from the asylum and returned to
Haddonfield, where he method-
ically chopped up all of Jamie Lee
Curtis's friends, who were a bad
influence on her anyway, if you
ask me.

Michael’s psychiatrist, Dr. Sam
Loomis (Donald Pleasence, not
John Gavin) rescued her in the
nick of time, shooting him repeat-
edly. Later, in the second install-
ment, he ignites an oxygen tank,
seemingly killing both Michael

Here goes. Follow if you can:

It is 10 years later, and Michael
Myers (George P. Wilbur) is
comatose in a maximum securi-
ty ward at the Federal Hospital in
Illinois. His face is still bandaged
from the explosion (like he hasn’t
had plenty of time to heal), and
the federal authorities have
demanded his transfer to a state
hospital. L

While en route to his new
home, Michael decides it's time
to go trick or treating and subse-
quently takes out the medical van
crew single—handedly.

Loomis, upon learning of the
transfer disaster on the night be-
fore Halloween, begins his sec-
ond trip to Haddonfield, where
he believes Michael will certain-
ly go to murder his only living
relative, a young niece named
Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris).

The local authorities, headed
by Sheriff Meeker (Beau Starr),
barricade themselves inside
Meeker’s house and callthe state

‘police for backup assistance via

shortwave radio, since Michael
has already butchered the folks at
the police station and has
knocked out the town's electrici-
ty (Haddonfield’s finest).

by a pulsating drum machine and
an assortment of tapes, Nivek and

contained an eclectic smattering
of Einsturzende Neubauten and

Chicago played at Lunch Time

By Mark Brown

C ontributing Editor

Pitt's Lunch Time Theatre re-
cently finished its presentation of
Sam Shepard’s play Chicago on
Friday, Oct. 21.

The primary performers were

. Brad Lichtenstein, who played

the part of Stu, and Sue Duber-
stein, who portrayed the charac-
ter Joy, Stu’s lover.

”The general idea was that Stu
portrayed the artist in America,”
said Duberstein, a CMU theater
arts major from Bethel Park.

Duberstein said that she chose
the name Joy because it was al-
legorical. Her persona was joyful.

 

Throughout the play, _5tl_J F9-
nains in a bathtub maintaining a
rap that he found difficult. Ac-
cording to Lichtenstein, ”This
play was one of the most bizarre
things that I've ever done in my
life. People in the [theater arts]
department liked it, but won-
dered what the hell it was about.
The play concerned viewing the
world as insane, typical early
Sam Shepard stuff.”

One prop used by the rest of
the cast was a fishing pole, which
Duberstein said represented fish-
ing for meaning in life. ”We were
all fishing for Stu,” said
Duberstein.

In the play, Joy accepts a job

York, and she is torn between
staying with her lover or leaving.
Stu remains in the bathtub, inces-
santly treating the audience to a
monologue best described as
schizophrenic.

’’It was difficult for me to
memorize all of those lines, but
they were all important. It was
hard to keep that train of thought,
especially while sitting in a
bathtub," said Lichtenstein, a Pitt
student concentrating in pre—med
studies.

Both Duberstein and Lichten-
stein are auditioning for the next
Lunch Time Theatre play, Danc-
ing, which opens Nov. 28 and
will be held in the basement
theater of the Cathedral of

Prince brings his new controversial show to town.

By Erin Flynn
Staff Writer

Prince is soon to arrive in Pitts-
burgh with his outrageous live
show on Oct. 28 to promote his
newest album, Lovesexy.

The funk—rock singer has re-
cently toured the_ United King-
dom, all of Germany, and he is
now hitting every major North
American market in the States.
His concert is an exhibition, a
rich phenomenon displaying his
flighty and ultra-drastic in-
ventions.

The dazzling stage show fea-
tures a basketball court and other
playground equipment, an over-
sized hydraulic bed, neon signs,
a mammoth—sized, heart—shaped
candy box, a rotating drumset for
special guest Sheila E., and the
vintage Thunderbird seen in his
"Alphabet Street” video. The un-

With these props, Prince cre-

where he performs. He performs
songs from his entire risque
career, along with a healthy por-
tion of hits from his current LP,
Lovesexy.

Prince's tradition of black
American music continues with
this new Paisley %releg,se,
while it introduces and iii"aT"i<’s his
recently discovered spiritual
growth. His songs discuss desires,
but teach listeners to commit to
a higher power.

is daring, if not blasphemous.

There are phrases on Lovesexy
such as, ”Let Him touch u and
your own lovesexy will be born,”
”a feeling you get when you fall
in love/ not with a girl or boy, but
with the heavens above,” “The
sexuality’s real/ Tonight we make
love with only words,” and ”God
is alive/ Let Him touch you.”

Prince combines his awakened
spirituality with rather forward
lyrics, and the religious and sex-
ual references have brought a
question to mind. Considering
the previously provocative
Prince, writing the extremely sug-
gestive ”Let’s pretend we’re mar-
ried,” and the juicy lyrics to
”Darling Nikki,” is it believable
that this promiscuous performer
has really found himself a whole
new evolution through God?

A French publication, Le
Figaro, said that ”God will sure-
ly forgive this rougish sinner of
show biz.”

|fGod doesn't forgive him, the
rest of the world will, and already
has. Lovesexy has quickly
reached number one in the Unit-
ed Kingdom, all across Germany,
and is doing very well in the
States. Prince's Madison Square
Garden show sold out in 40
minutes, and he started off his
tour in Paris with four sold—out
performances.

Prince begins his album saying,
"Welcome to the New Power
Generation. The reason my voice
is so clear is there's no smack in
my hrain ” He tries tn relats In his
listeners, as well as guide. them
with his wisdom and experience.

Lovesexy, Prince's daring a-nd

don't leave much to the imagi-
nauon.

Halloween

Continued from page 11

Carpenter’s superb sense of
camera direction and his overall
captivating style made the origi-
nal Halloween (produced for less
than $300,000) a $60 million,
critical success in 1978 and suc-
cessfully revived the audience-
suspense film.

Dwight H. Little, director of
Halloween 4, lacks any con-
sistency in effectively building
suspense and instead goes for
what author Stephen King has
referred to as the ”total gross-
out,” making this film nothing
more than a flimsy special effects
and horror vehicle which does lit-
tle more than churn the stomach
and insult the intelligence.

In terms of characterization,
there is none. Alan McElroy has
written a screenplay that would
probably serve better for wrap-
ping fish than making movies.
His characters are as dull and as
boring as the lifeless, incompe-
tent actors who play them.

Donald Pleasence, the remark-
able actor who brought us such
fine performances in Escape to
Witch Mountain, Oh, God! and,
of course, Hearts ofthe West, dis-
plays major Oscar potential in
this film 

McElroy has also turned what
was once a vulnerable, frighten-
ing Michael Myers character into
a suburban Jason Voorhees, who
possesses superhuman strength
that is entirely laughable. And, of

‘SHOWCASE Soun

Nice Strong Arm
Mind Furnace
Homestead

Nice Strong Arm's newest LP,
Mind Furnace, is an album filled
with stories and haunting images.
The album sounds like old Smiths
records because of the band's use
of visions of people and odd in-
cidents for songs.

The album opens with ”Win-
dowsill,” a story about an actor,
an empty theater, a hazy film and
pigeons. Good thing that the
words are included inside the
cover. Like songs by The Cure,
the lyrics are not only slightly
difficult to understand, they are
too interesting to pass up.

With a few of the songs, like
”Everyday an Ambulance” and
”Faucethead,” it’s easy to get lost
in the thick sound, and it's not the
most attractive fog, either.

With ”Secret Language,” their
lyrics are charmingly eerie, with
images such as ”the klutching
kitchen kiss klings desperately,
dying, dreaming of yesterday's
youth.”

Mind Furnace’s most wicked-
ly draining song has to be
”Swingset.” ‘Keeping with in-
credible ”Morrissey fashion," this
song is about the pain that a small
child goes through after her
mommy is killed. Sharp lyrics like
”How could she know at four,

what the hell a gun was for?”-

combine with dreamy, playful vi-
sions l_ike ”loving playtime
swingset mommy.” The chorus

”so just go away” is effective as 9

a childlike response.
Their sound is solid, and their
wild immagination is poetic, but

— Erin Flynn

 Fishbone

Truth and Soul
Columbia

Truth and Soul from Fishbone
shows the growth in this distinc-
tive, talented band. Is it for bet-
ter or for worse? Their second
album continued their deep brass
sound and jolting rhythm, while
Truth and Soul, their third,vtakes
a big step towards more consis-
tent melodies, tame voices and
fewer mid—song suprises.

”Freddie’s Dead” is sung like
a storytime song. Before their per-
formance of this song in last
week's Oakland appearance, the
band preached that the song is
about the deadliness of hard
drugs like heroin and crack.

Too many of the cuts on this
record skip by because of a
predictable melody Fishbone has
acquired. ”Ma and Pa," ”Ques-
tion of Life” and ”One Day” are

. examples of this change.

”Bonin’ in the Boneyard.”
Here we are! A good ol’ Fishbone
song just like the old days. Com-
plete with a brass sound and
quick lyrics, ”Boneyard” even
has the traditional Fishbone
abrupt stops, attacking again with
a totally different melody. Very
similar to ”Turn the Other Way”
from the LP In Your Face, ”Pour-
ing Rain” is sultry, devouringly
slow and very un-Fishbone.

Other than ”Ghetto Sound-
wave” and the racing rhythm of
”Sub|iminal Facism,” Truth and
Soul changes, rather than con-
tinues, Fishbone’s original sound.
”Change” is the last song on the
album. How appropriate. The
song, which sounds identical
live, has a gentle guitar and con-
trolled voices. What a great way
to end the album, and how sym-
bolic of Fishbone’s new sound

when compared to the old.
— Erin Flynn

The Feelies
Only Life
/\&M

Only Life, the third release by
Hoboken’s Feelies, is an excel-
lent album that should spring-
board the band to popular
acclaim. Showcased are the
band’s tight, distinctive sound
and their clear, accessible lyrics.

The band is comprised of five
talented musicians, including Bill
Million and Glenn Mercer, both
playing some polished guitar
licks and co—writing all the origi-
nal material on the album. Merc-
er handles all of the lead vocals
and is reminiscent of Lou Reed.
Brenda Stuart is an A-1 bassist, es-

dings

on vinyl.

Let’s Active is Eric Marshall and
John Heames laying down the
bass and back-beat, and‘Mitch
Easter and Angie Carlson sharing
the mike. Easter co—produced the
album and co—wrote all the origi-
nal songs with Carlson. Their
voices range from Easter’s nasal
talking/singing wail to Carlson's
rich, versatile singing.

Another refreshing aspect of
the band's range is its willingness
to roam musically. From the
bluesy rocker, ”Terminate,” to
the psuedo-jazz instrumental,
”Orpheus in Hades Lounge,” to
the straight—ahead rocker—with-an-
edge, ”Ten Layers Down,” Let's
Active does it all with a distinc-
tive flavor.

Every Dog is a sure hit with
anyone who likes the guitar rock
bands of the progressive scene.

-Oakland listening range that

makes her presence felt on the

whole record. Duo drummers
Stan Demerski and Dave Weck—
erman add to the musical muscle
and percussion without drowning
out the rest of the group.

There isn't a bad cut on the al-
bum, and you can't help but
move to the music since most of
the songs are fast paced, and all
are under five minutes long.

THE PITT NEWS

‘Open date gives Pitt
chance to mend prior
to last home game

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

Not too many major college
football coaches would look for-
ward to having a week off, after
their team outscored the last two
opponents by a combined 94-17
margin, but that is exactly the at-
titude that Pittsburgh head coach
Mike Gottfried is taking with the
Panthers’ weekend break in the
schedule.

”We’ve got a good chance to

Q rest some people and heal some

tr

  

injuries,” Gottfried said at yester-
day's light practice session at Pitt
Stadium. ”We needed this week
of .” H

indeed, four of the best players
— offensive tackle Tom Ricketts,
wideout Billy Osborn, running
back Adam Walker and defensive
tackle Marc Spindler did not even
practice yesterday.

Ricketts, a candidate for sever-
al postseason honors and an
almost certain first— or second-
round pick in next year's Nation-
al Football League draft, is still
suffering the effects of a badly
sprained ankle. Osborn, mean-
while, is bothered by a gimpy an-
kle, and Walker has yet to
recover from nagging ankle and
groin injuries suffered early in the
season.__ j _ _ ~

Spindler is out for the year with
a torn ligament in his knee, and
is back in Presbyterian Universi-
ty Hospital with an infection in
the same knee.

In addition, quarterback Larry
Wanke, offensive linemen Chris

Please see Injuries, page 21

 

Goetz and Roman Matusz , and
freshman linebacker Ricardo
McDonald all are hampered
somewhat by various ailments,
but nevertheless were able to don
sweatsuits and participate in
practice.

Luckily for Gottfried, several
young players have played
strong, despite being armed with
only limited experience, allowing
Pitt to annihilate Temple 42-7
two weeks ago and Navy 52-6 in
the annual Homecoming contest
this past Saturday.

”We’re very pleased with how
the young players have come
on,” Gottfried said. ”So many
times you just can't measure what
that means to a team.”

Obviously, the scintillating
emergence of freshman Curvin
Richards has taken up the slack,
to say the least, during Walker's
absence in the linuep, but the
overall injury situation reached
critical proportions in the Navy
contest, especially for both lines.

The left side of the Panther
offensive line was anchored by
redshirt freshmen Scott Miller and
Dave Dixon rather than veterans
Goetz and Ricketts.

Defensively, four true freshmen
— Jeff Esters, Mike Chalenski,
Ken Radinick and Gary
Gorajewski — saw extensive
playing time against the Midship-
men, and performed well.

a ”We’re going to work with a
patched-up offensive line, but we
hope to get some of them back
for Rutgers,” Gottfried stated.

Cornerback Alonzo Hampton has averaged 11.9 yards per return through seven games:

 

Hampton 10th in the
country in punt returns

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

It used to be that when a play-

W er was put on the special teams,

it was because he wasn't good
enough to start.

In private meetings, the
coaches would say things like,
”He can't run. He can't block. He
can't tackle. Put him on the spe-
cial teams.”

Well, times have changed. Not
only are the special team players
some of the best athletes on the
team, they are also many of the
starters.

Every team in the country does
this in hopes of gaining excellent
field position and maybe even a
few points.

Pitt is no exception to this. On
kickoff returns, they have shifted
their lineup somewhat through-
out the season. On punt returns,
it has been defensive back Alon-
zo Hampton.

Hampton has responded in
grand fashion. He is averaging
11.9 yards a return, including a
71-yarder for a touchdown
against Northern Iowa. Not too
bad for a guy who sat out last sea-

_ son after transferring from River-

side Junior College in California.

’’I really enjoy returning
punts,” Hampton, 6-foot, 195
pounds, said. ”Of course, the
other guys getting good blocks for

you makes it a lot easier.

”We have really been working
hard on our special teams in prac-
tice. it's starting to pay off in the
games. Everybody is getting their
blocks and making my job easy.”

Hampton is not only the Pan-
ther punt returner, but he doubles
as a defensive back. Hampton is
currently eighth on the team in
with 30 tackles and always seems
to be around the ball.

”My first love is defensive
back,” Hampton said. ”Special
teams started out as something
that I did to help out the team. It
has turned into something more
now.”

Hampton is 10th in the nation
in punt returns, which is some-
thing he has yearned for all year.

”One of my goals when I
found out that I was going to
return punts was to finish in the
top 10 in punt returns at the end
of the year,” Hampton said. ’’If
I can continue to do as well as l
have, and the rest of the guys on
the punt return team help out,
then my goal will be accom-
plished.” '

The part of the Pitt schedule
that could be brutal to the team
is the last three games. They play
at Penn State, at N.C. State and
at Syracuse —— three very tough
road games. Yet, Hampton
doesn't see this as much of a

 THE PITT NEWS, Thursdcty, Octoberl27, I988

WVU two-touchdown favorite over PSU 

This week, the eyes of the na-
tion are on West Virginia. The
Mountaineers take on Penn State
in a nationally televised contest
(CBS, 2:30 p.m.) that is probably
the biggest game in the history of
West Virginia football.

So many things are riding on
this game for West Virginia. First,
and most importantly, the ’Eers
must win to keep their goal of a
national championship alive. Se-
cond, West Virginia can, by
soundly beating Penn State, send
a message—to the country: there
is more to Eastern football than
just Pitt and Penn State. Finally,
WVU quarterback Maior Harris,

who is coming off the best game
of his career, will be showcased
to the nation for the first time.

Last week: 6-4 (.600), For the
year: 51-23 (.689).

West Virginia — 31, Penn
State —-— 17.

Amazing as it may seem, Penn
State is simply not a good football
team. The only thing left for the
Lions to try is to upset Notre
Dame or please their fans with a
win over hated Pitt.

Rutgers — 28, Temple — 14.

This year it was thought that the
Beasts of the East were West Vir-
ginia, Syracuse and Rutgers until
the Scarlet Knights lost to Army.

Utah — 5, San Diego St —-— 3.
The WAC is completely out of
hand. They usually score a ton of
points, but this week the defenses
take over. In a weird game, the
Utes will get a safety with less

VINCE
LONGO

than a minute to play. Put the
house on it.

Upset of the Week:

Arizona St — 27, Oregon — 20

ASU surprised many people
last week by beating Washington
State. This week it's the Ducks’

turn to feel the wrath of the Sun
Devils. And Oregon had just
burst back into the Top 20, too.

UCLA —— 30, Washington St —-
14.

This would have been a much
bigger game if, as mentioned
above, the Cougars hadn't been
upset by Arizona State. Washing-
ton State must have been looking
past ASU to UCLA.

Illinois — 21, Minnesota — 20.

The Illini came from nowhere
to post an undefeated Big 10
record until last week, when they
were nipped by Michigan State,
26-21. Illinois is not out of the Big
Ten race — yetﬂ

Lasorda
manager
of year

By Ronald Blum
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — Tommy Lasor-
da, who led Los Angeles to the
World Series championship and
their sixth National League West

title in 12 years, was named NLQ‘

Manager of the Year Wednesday
by the Baseball Writers Associa-
tion of America.

Lasorda received 101 points in
balloting by a committee of two
writers from each NL city. He had
19 first-place votes and was
named on 23 of 24 ballots. It was
the second time Lasgrda was vet-
ed manager of the year. He won
the award in 1983, its initial year.

Jim Leyland of Pittsburgh was
second with 50 points after lead-
ing the Pirates to an 85-75 record
and second place in the East be-
hind the New York Mets.

Davey Johnson, who led the
Mets to a league-leading 100-60
record and their second East title
in three years, was third with 38
points.

Jack McKeon, who took over
the Padres from Larry Bowa on
May 28, was fourth with 27
points. San Diego was 67-48 un-
der McKeon and had the second-
best record in the league over the
final four months of the season.

Lasorda learned that he had
won while flying to Los Angeles
after the Dodgers had been ho-
nored Wednesday at the White
House.

”This completes my day —— one
of the greatest days of my life,”
the Dodger manager told Jack
Lang, secretary-treasurer of the
writers’ group, in a telephone
conversation from the plane.

”Any success that a manager
gets can only come through the
contributions of the players be-
cause they’re the ones that do the
job,” Lasorda said at the White
House.

The Dodgers, who won the
West by seven games, were
94-67 this year after finishing
73-89 in 1986 and 1987.

Los Angeles is 1,022-874 in
Lasorda’s 12 years as manager.
He ‘is third among active
managers in victories behind
Sparky Anderson of Detroit and
Whitey Herzog of St. Louis and
is 38th on the all—time list.

Lasorda has been with the
Dodgers for 39 years — 12 as
manager, four as a coach, eight
as a minor-league manager, four
as a scout and 11 as a player,
primarily in the minor leagues.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 27, l988

. Recruiting ties make Lions-Panthers HamPt0|1

volleyball match something special

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The battle for Eastern volleyball
supremacy comes to Pitt as the
Lady Panthers host the 20th-
ranked Penn State Lady Lions at
7 p.m. Saturday at Fitzgerald
Field House.

Last year, before an enthusias-
tic throng of 1,300 at Fitzgerald
Field House, the Lady Panthers
defeated Penn State three games
to one.

Penn State will be coming to
town with a sparkling 24-1
record, their lone loss being to a
ranked University _ of Texas at
Arlington squad.

The Lady Panthers will be tak-
ing a 15-5 record into the fray and
plan on giving no quarter to Penn
State.

”We feel confident for a num-
ber of reasons. We have played
some top caliber opponents
[BYU, Pacific, Texas, Arizona,

LSU and Houston], while Penn‘

State has not been playing tough
opposition lately. Secondly, we
have been consistently improving
this year,” said Pitt coach Shelton
Collier.

Both Pitt and Penn State will be
fielding young teams, with the
Lady Panthers starting the only
two seniors in the match —
Denise Frawley and Nora Mulvi-

hill. Their younger teammates .

will look for them‘ to provide
leadership.

’’It is a really big rivalry for us.
I think playing at home will pro-

-- vide us with a big advantage,"

commented all—American candi-
date Frawley.

Middle—blocker Mulvihill has
her own personal reasons for be-
ing highly motivated to beat Penn
State.

’’I didn't get to play last year
against Penn State, and I really
want to play well against them
this year. It is our biggest home
match of the season,” she noted.

As with football, the Pitt-Penn
State rivalry in volleyball runs
deep. Many of the athletes per-
forming on both sides of the court
narrowed their final collegiate
choices to either Pitt or Penn
State. They are anxious to prove
that they made the right choice.

The recruiting rivalry alone
would be sufficient to stoke the
competitive fires of the two
schools, but year after year the

match has determined the top A

team in the East as well as had
NCAA tournament implications.

The Lady Panthers to an in-
dividual are anxious to face the
Lady Lions.

”lt’s the biggest game of the
season. l think coming off losses
to two beatable teams, like LSU
and Houston, we have a lot to
take out on an opponent. And
Penn State is that opponent.
There is no one I like playing
against more than Penn State,”

A said co-captain Kelly Matheis.

The Lady Panthers took two of
three matches from Penn State
last season with their defeat oc-
curring in the last meeting of the
season between the two teams.
That loss has provided added
motivation for the Pitt team.

’’I didn't get to play last year,
and I really want to avenge our
loss at Penn State. We hope to
show our fans we are a team
worth supporting,” commented
middle—blocker Michele

Adamson.

One of the goals the Pitt team
set for itself at the start of the sea-
son was to be nationally ranked,
and Penn State is a hurdle to
clear.

”l think the team is excited to
play the match against Penn State
at home. We are confident we
will play well in front of a large
crowd. Our intensity has picked
up with this match in mind,” said
Collier.

NOTES: Prior to the match on
Saturday, former U.S. Olympic
Team Captain Sue Woodstra will
give a clinic on ”lmproving Your
Defense and Serve Reception
Skills.” The clinic will start at 5
p.m., and admission is free.

get at home. We just have to play
harder and more like a team.

”Right now, we feel really
good after winning two games.
We dominated offensively and

defensively in those games.
Everybody is ready for the last
stretch ‘of the season.”
Hampton is originally from
Denver, Colo., where the air is a
little thinner, and you have to
breathe more heavily. So far this
season, Hampton has played
above what everybody expected
and made opponents breathe

heavily every time he touches the
ball.

Pitt soccer team breaks skid with 3-0 win,

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

The Panther soccer team
(5-7-1) proved to be too much for
Niagara University last night,
coming up with amuch-needed
3-0 victory.

Panther goalkeeper Jay Kapus-
ta recorded his second shutout of
the season, as the defense totally
shut down Niagara's offensive
attack.

Pitt mounted its own offensive
attack as two freshmen scored
their first goals of the season.

Brian Pellegrino scored unas-
sisted at 25:11.

”The ball hit off a defender first
into me. It
dropped to my feet and I just
tucked it away in the goal,”
Pellegrino said. ”It was the best
thing that ever could happen.”

Freshman striker Mike Laus
scored on a pass from Mark
Mostinckx midway through the
second half.

The final Panther goal came
late in the second half as Scott

Armstrong poked one in unassist-
ed to the chant of ”LEMlEUX!”
from the crowd.

Niagara was so frustrated that
they resorted to tripping, holding,
and tackling to stop the ever-
encroaching Panther offense.
Several yellow cards were issued
to assorted members of the team.
The most blatant penalty came as
a Niagara fullback literally
grabbed Bryan Hammond's jer-
sey with both hands and pulled
him to the ground to prevent a
breakaway.

The Panthers beat a pretty good
team. Niagara tied Cannon
University, which is ranked No.
1 in Division II. They lost to Syra-
cuse, ranked in the top 20, in the
final minute of that game. Over-
all, Niagara is two games above
.500 at 10-8-1. -

Pellegrino said, ”They’re great
one—touch players. Things just
didn't go their way, and they had
their chances.”

One curious element in this
game was the play of Niagara's
defense. Namely, their goalie

punted the ball but once the en-
tire game. Mostly, he just threw
the ball out to his defenders.

This curious phenomenon kept
offensive pressure in Niagara's
end for most of the game.

Panther assistant coach Bob
Campbell said, ”That’s just their
style of play. They tried to con-
trol the ball with short passing,
which is more English. I guess
their coach feels any ball in the
air is a 50-50 ba|l.”

Parts of the game were marked
by player congestion on all areas
of the field. Players from both
sides were consistently bunched
up, with no one to pass to. Coach
Joe Luxbacher explained, ”They
play a short-pass game and try to
get a lot of people around the
ball. We knew they weren't go-
ing to open up, so we tried to
close the space around the ball.
Some teams draw you in and

then send [the ball], but they
didn’t.”

Pitt did not suffer from congest-
ed play, but Niagara certainly
did. All of Pitt's goals resulted
from change-of-field passes
which caught the bunched-up
Niagara defense off guard.

Finally, the Panthers have
produced a multi-goal game, af-
ter scoring only one goal in their
four previous games. Luxbacher
hopes his team will get used to
putting the ball in the net.

The Panthers really have not
been overmatched all season.
They have faced some extreme-
ly tough opponents and have lost
by slight margins. Luxbacher feels
that Pitt is an extremely capable
Division I team.

’’I was telling the guys in prac-
tice this week that we're not too
far from being a real good team,”
Luxbacher said. ”The guvs have

 

been working hard. They had a
great effort against St. John's [last
season's division winner]. It just
seems like some nights you score,
and others you don't.”

Approximately 190 fans braved
the cold on Youth Night at Pitt
Stadium to witness the victory.
An aspiring collegiate women’;-
striker, Heather Osmond from
Swissvale, said of her favorite lo-
cal team, ”The offense appeared
to be running most effectively in
this game. The Panthers have
been struggling all season with
scoring. It looks like they're on
the right track now, and I hope
they can keep it up against Vil-
lanova.”

And ’Nova it is this Saturday at
1:30 p.m. in the stadium as the
Panthers close out their Big East
season. Pitt plays their final home

game on Monday, Oct. 31, atc‘

2:30 p.m. against IUP.

,Q_K

Noll undecided on quarterback

PITTSBURGH (AP) - Pitts.
burgh Steelers quarterback
Bubby Brister seems ready to
play on Sunday against the
New York Jets, but Coach
Chuck Noll has not named a
starting quarterback for the
game.

Brister’s status was upgrad-
ed Wednesday from question-
able to probable, but he
continued to split practice

time with quarterback Todd
Blackledge, who has played
the last three games.

Brister dislocated the middle
finger of his right hand during
the Steelers’ Oct. 2 loss to
Cleveland.

Offensive guard John Rien-
stra, on injured reserve since
Sept. 20 with a fracture in his
lower right leg, suffered a
sprained left ankle during
Wednesday's practice.

Linebacker Gregg Carr, list-
ed as questionable with an an-
kle injury for Sunday's game,
did not practice Wednesday.

The remaining injured Steel-
ers are listed as probable and
practiced on Wednesday.
They are running back Earnest
Jackson (ribs), defensive end
Tim Johnson (shoulder) and
lineb_acker Bryan Hinkle
(hand)

Lemieux not happy
with Pen’s new offer

(AP) —— Pittsburgh Penguins
star center Mario Lemieux said
Wednesday the team's latest
contract offer was ”not very
good/’

Penguins General Manager
Tony Esposito met with
Lemieux’s agent, Tom Reich,
in Pittsburgh Tuesday, offering
what he said was a seven—year
contract that would -make

Lemieux ”definitely the
second-highest paid player in
the league.”

Reich told Lemieux about
the proposal late Tuesday
night, shortly after Lemieux

-scored two goals and five

points to lead the Penguins to
a 6-1 victory over the Calgary
Flames at the Civic Arena.
”The proposal was not even
close to what we expected,”
Lemieux said after practice
Wednesday. ”We’re not hap-
py with the way they handled

, -~~~the- situation. I'll meet with

Tom Reich again Monday, and

some decision will be made
then.”

Lemieux, 23, has two years
and an option remaining on
his current contract, which is
believed to pay him more than
$600,000 this season.
Lemieux reportedly is seeking
about $l.5‘mil|ion a year.

Wayne Gretzky of the Los
Angeles Kings is the NHL’s
highest paid player, reported-
ly making $2 million a year.

The Penguins agreed to
renegotiate the deal after
Lemieux won the National
Hockey League's scoring
championship and Most Valu-
able Player award in 1987-88.

’’I think the organization is
smart enough to realize that
some people are making big
bucks’ in thisjleague,” said
Lemieux, who has racked up
15 goals and 3] points in eight
games this season. ’’I just want
tojbe treated fairly.”

Esposito said he didn't think
the offer was bad.

The reason Pitt has an off week
is because the Syracuse game,

at the Carrier Dome, has been
moved to Dec. 3 in order to ac-

The Panthers will be staring the
pesky Rutgers Scarlet Knights in
the eyes next weekend at Pitt

philosophy worked well enough
during Pitt's last week off, as Gott-

date.

Gottfried envisions his team
responding in a similar manner to
Rutgers.

”| just think we'll continue to
get better,” he said when asked
about how the off-week should
affect the Rutgers encounter.
”The players are working real
hard, and if they continue to
work hard, we should be all right.

Joe Paterno has yet to decide on his starting QB against WVU.

Sacca may be replaced by Lonergan

By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) —
With victories over traditional
rival West Virginia in 28 of the
last 29 years, Penn State is not ac-
customed to playing the spoiler
against the Mountaineers.

But Penn State Coach Joe Pater-
no says his Nittany Lions are at
least two—touchdown underdogs
against unbeaten and seventh-
ranked West Virginia for Satur-
day's game.

”This year, West Virginia has
much better personnel. We have
potentially good personnel, but
we're a year or two away at least.
They're there. They're there right
now,” Paterno said.

Penn State, 4-3, plays West Vir-
ginia, 7-0, in Morgantown, W.Va.

’’I think it's probably the best
offensive team we've ever played
against,” said Paterno, in his 23rd
year as Penn State's head coach.
’’I can't believe there are six
teams in the country better than
they are.”

Paterno, at his weekly news
conference Tuesday, compared
West Virginia's offense to Miami
in 1986 with Vinny Testaverde at
quarterback, but said quarterback
Major Harris’ running ability
made the Mountaineers more ex-
plosive.

Penn State defeated that Miami
team 14-10 to win the Fiesta
Bowl and the national champion-
ship, but Paterno was downplay-
ing the Lions’ chances against
West Virginia.

”lt’s going to be tough. We’re
going to go in there and hopeful-
ly they'll drop a few passes,” he
said.

Asked about the point spread
in Saturday's game, Paterno said,
’’I’m surprised it's only 13. I
would have thought it would
have been more. That's being
very generous to us.”

West Virginia has averaged 43
points a game and scored more
than 50 points three times.

Harris, a second—year quarter-
back, has completed 59 of 97
passes for 1,095 yards and seven
touchdowns. He has also run the
ball 72 times for 371 yards and

‘ five touchdowns.

West Virginia's last victory over
Penn State came in 1984, when
the Mountaineers won 17-14 at
home. Befo.e that, the Nittany
Lions had won 25 consecutive
games.

Penn State defeated West Vir-

ginia 25-21 last year and holdsra
44-8-2 advantage in the series.

This season, Paterno has been
trying to develop a freshman
quarterback and a young offense,
which has failed to score a touch-
down in the last six quarters ir~
successive losses to No. 16 Syra-
cuse and No. 19 Alabama. I-T

Tony Sacca, the first true fresh-
man ever to start for Paterno,

[replaced Tom Bill at quarterback

in the third game of the season
when the junior suffered a dislo-
cated kneecap.

”I think Sacca learned a great
deal by playing down in Alaba-
ma and I think our young offense
learned a lot,” Paterno said. ”We
now can raise a notch as to what
we can handle.”

Paterno said Sacca and the
offense would be better prepared
for the blitzes and crowd noise in
West Virginia as a result of the
8-3 loss last Saturday at Legion
Field in Birmingham, Ala.

Sacca has connected on just
under 40 percent of his passes,
completing 47 of 118 for 722
yards and four touchdowns. Har-

ris has a 61 percent completionﬁ

rate.

died just about every hole.’’,

Fuzzy Zoeller shot a 64', his‘?

best score this year, but found
himself in second place.

”That (62) was a marvelous
round of golf,” Zoeller said. ”Are
you sure he played all the way
around?” I

Zoeller, seeking his first tour,

victory since 1986, was 8-under-
par at the Lake Buena Vista
course, the shortest and easiest of
the three layouts. Mark Calcavec—
Chlaz F00l<l€ Jay Don Blake and
Mark McCumber all shot 65 at
the same course and were tied for
third.

Five golfers shot a 66 —— Chip
Beck, the tour’s No. 2 money
winner this year, and Rick Pear-
son at Lake Buena Vista; Robert
Wrenn ‘and Tom Kite at Palm;
and David Edwards at Magnolia.

Paul Azinger, Donnie Ham-
mond and Russ Cochran shot 67.
Nineteen golfers had a 68.
Defending champion Larry Nel-
son had a 72.

Par was broken by 80 of the Q

132 entrants.

’’I know it's depressing to shoot
1 or 2 or 3 under, and 40 people
have passed you,” Zoeller said.

Lohr started slowly, missing bir-
die putts of 8, 15 and 18 feet on
the first four holes. But he
knocked two 140-foot wedge
shots to within a foot of the cup
for birdies, and later made birdie
putts of 15, 25 and 15 feet. Lohr
birdied all four of the par 5 holes
and tied his personal best score.

”The key was I drove it really
well, and that set me up on the
fairways,” he said.
