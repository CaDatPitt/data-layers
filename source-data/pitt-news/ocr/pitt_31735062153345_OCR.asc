The June issue"ot the Pitt Review _
afppearedbion the campus last Friday. A

The cover design, a. clever picture of
graduation styles, was drawn by Ruth
Thomas. Several articles on univer-

sity literary ‘interests and graduation.-

were printed, together withetan ‘essay
by Henry Kelly upon “Pitts-burgh.As
A Far Country.*" _ . V «

The important part ofthe issue was
the material submitted under, _ the

.;wiiiiem ..A;-.‘.JohhSton,lShort..gSt01;Y. 0<.>n- .

test of {one hundred dollars. Mr.
Johnston repeated his splendid offer
this year with the result that an en-
couraging increase was noted in the
interest in the Pitt Review. and in the
short story ﬁeld. _The students have
a great debt of thanks which they
owe to Mr. Johnston for this chance
to compete under the stimulus of a
prize Offer.

Some of the " stories which have
been printed in- this number are:
“Blind 4, Fathers”. by ‘Chauncey E.
Pruger; “A Rubber '1:'ale"iby R. Nel-
son Irons; “Beautiful Untrue Things”
by Samuel Albo, and “The Boy's
David” '-by Frederick P. Mayer. ‘

The Arnold W. Rosenthal Essay-
Contest is also doing a. great deal to
encourage literary activity at Pitt,
and an article of appreciation~ for Mr.
Rosentliars oﬁer has been printed in
this issue. Essays» for this contest
are being judged and will be rated
in the near future, ,

An article reviewing the four years
of a senior’s life at Pitt completes
the number. This article, “Looking
Backward," was written by Miriam
L. Bomhard. 1 The Pitt Review will
be on sale at Memorial Hall today. ' ‘

LITERARY FRATERNITY.  
is IIREANIZEII HERE

'1 ‘The fraternity committee of the
University approved the application
of the “Scriveners” for recognition as

an honorary literary fraternity, May
27. The Greek termination was: not
used because it.was felt that the char-
acter of the new fraternity could ’-be
emphasized best ‘by the use of an Eng-
lish title, but the organization is list-
ed and will operate as a fraternity,
despite the change in the usual meth-
od of naming fraternities with the
customary Greek letters,-

The object of the organization is to
give the members an opportunity to
write under criticism. It has been
felt that some ‘group interested in the
production of original work could
beneﬁt by frequent meetings to dis-
cuss problems. To increase the in-
terest in writing and literature, by
offering an opportunity for informal
discussion has «been the purpose of
the new fraternity. "

Opportunity for membership will be
given to those who feel I that their
ability in- writing would make them
eligible, forimembership by two stated
meetings each year, when manuscript
may be submitted for competitive
membership in the fraternity.

The oﬁicers elected are: Frederick
P, Mayer, president; C. R. Thayer,
vice president;- Elizabeth H. Wilkin-
son, secretary, and Samuel V. Albo,
treasurer. Professor Lincoln R. Gibbs

Tonight"-s  banquet at‘)-the Hotel Schenley ‘at

6:30 o’clock will wind up the Commencement activities
and it will be a’ﬁt‘ting ﬁnale for» one of the most important
‘ years in the history of the University. While the banquet
is called an “A1umn‘iy;’Banquet,” thisterm is applied be’-
_ cause the Association‘ merely arranges the details
for it. It could‘ perhaps more properly be termed a “Uni-
versity banquet.” as all Pittites, including members of the
undergraduate and alumni ranks, trustees, faculty, etc.,
are in~vite‘d. .. Following the usual plan,» it will ‘be strictly
informal a.nd every, effort will be made to eliminate all
“stiffness.” The  Entertainment Committee wants
everyone to come and have -a good time and the program

. has been arranged with that

in view.

of the School of Education. It just
happens - that “Charlie” ' has a‘
“Charlie “Junior” now a student at
Pitt so that he is in a position to
speak from the standpoint of an
alumnus and the “dad” of a student.
_ The speakers, - . ’

The speakers will -be, George
Wl1arton‘Pepper. of Philadelphia, the
Com-encement Day orator; Arthur
W._ Thompson, president, of the Phil-
adelphia ,-Company, and Chancellor
Emeritus McCormick, recipients of
honorary degrees; ..Roland. A. Mc
Crady, newly electer chairman of
Alumni’ Council, and Chancellor John
G. Bowman. This will be Chancellor
Bowman's initial bow to the alumni
of Pitt and everyone‘ will listen
eagerly to wh~a‘t he has to say. Mr.
Thompson is one of‘ the most active
alumni of Allegheny College,‘ which
is now engaged in an. endowment
campaign and is one of "Pittsburgh's
most prominent ‘business men. _ In

The program of an. -‘oratorical con-

through the kindness of Miss M317

Mrs. Hamilton, who kept the PTO-
, gram for gmore than half a: century.
‘ was the -ﬂrst graduate of Central High
school, itself the first institution of
thatgrade in the city. She was long
' considered an authority upon the early
educational‘ «affairs of Pittsburgh and
she and her sister, through Whose
thoughtfulness the program came to

us, are descendants of one ‘of the,

earliest ‘and best’ known of the “old
famniesff in ‘Western Pennsylvania.

prominence at the bar in New York
City and was one of the most Acon-
sistently enthusiastic of the Univer-

’life.‘- Another name which appears on

the program is that of Dr. David "V R.

is known to scores of students and

lthousandst of alumni through his long

service to. the community and

hold that leadership in the Pittsburgh
distr‘ict——-—such names as Childs, Mar-

and others. There is inter-evst, too, in
the subjects of these orations. It is
quite probable that their contest dif-
fers much less thanmlght be expected
from that of the speeches on similar
occasions by present. day undergrad-

are’ a long distance from those which

Women was created in the summer,
Of 1919, and Thyrsa  Amos, at
that time,» social director for ‘the
summer session of the University of
? The
title then agreed on was Adviser. of
Women, but was changed in 1920 to
Dean of Women’. Why was the de
partment -created? For several rea-
First, the increased enroll-g
nlent of women introduced certain
deﬁnite problems which we-re not
academic, and which were peculiarly
student problems. ‘Second, the‘ inter-
estsoff the Women students needed
to  centralized, and these various
interests‘ organizedvfor the best ex-
pression and development of  the
women. A-- third reason was the
need for a general representative
of the‘ women before thefaclty and
the public. ' _

Some the student problems which
have met wltlr-some solution in the
last two years are ‘those of; voca-
tional gguidance, self-help. ' scholar

Besides innumerable ‘ individual con-
ferences with reference to ‘choice of.
life "career, the dean of women, in
conjunction‘ with an undergraduate
committee, has arranged several
group ,oontferen.ces -where discussions
of speciﬁc vocations have been car-
riedﬁon.   .  ... -.

In -Apri‘l»,%= 1920, Helen -Bennett," of
Chicago Bureau of Occupation, was
brought‘ to Pitt to conduct a three’
days’ conference on vocations. Wom-
en were allowed cuts to ‘attend
_these lectures. - In the fall -of 1020,

ance Association was entertained by
the women‘ of Pitt, and an opportun-
ity given to hear notable men and
women’ discuss their A chosen voca-
tions. The dean of women makes 'a
~survey of ' each girl’s vocational .in-
terests, Whlich is the basis for indi-
‘vl'druéa'.l help. .
.The problem of .-the self-supporting
girl is a; large one at Pitt. The dean
of women has secured positions and
ﬁnancial ‘aid for“many women in the
last two years. \. Self-help demands

of [registrationin schools. of the Uni:-'.

has helped to secure s.a.ti.sfactory ar-
rangements for a number of women.

Scholastic standing-has not been
an ideal for certain types of women,
who are concerned chieﬂy with so-
-curing a ‘degree, rather than a‘.n-ed-u-
cation. Various methods of inter-
esting the women in scholarship per
se'_ha.ve been introduced, and in ‘sev-
eral ._ instances, successfully.

It is not possible to discuss all
the various‘, problems. It would not
be fair, however, to omit the social
ideals which the dean of women has
expressed and has worked.’ for at

Membership of Chess Club  
  Gains During Past Year

The growthof interest in the game
of chess during the past year has
been one of the most prominent as
well as one of_ the ‘most’ interesting
features. in campus activities. Two
years ago the only interest manifest-
ed ih the game was by seven mem-
bers of the_:Sichool of Chemistry who
had a‘liking for the game and formed
a small club. They did not, however,
hold regular meetings or pretend to
represent the University. During the
1919-20 season the club raised its
membership to 17, but still did not
attempt to obtain recognition from
the University as an activity. At the
beginning of the first semester this
year the membership of the clu-b took

a sudden upward trend and the pros- ,

pects were so -bright‘ that the mem-
bers decided to form a deﬁnite organ-
ization and petition the authorities
for recognition. This was accom-

. plished and the club membership now

stands as follows: president, Albert
E. Hoyt, Chem. ’23; vice president,
Leon N. Loeb, -Chem. ’22, and secre-
tary-treasurer, Norman J. Harrar,

2 is hoped that the chess team will be

sent to New York to play in the an-
nual intercollegiate matches next
fall. Inasmuch as the annual tourn-
ament will not be over soon eno-ugh,
the team which has just had the
most successful »-season will probably
represent the University in these
matches. . ‘

To prevent the placing of the Var-
sity chess team players in the same
bracket when the drawings for the
tournament are""'m-ade- next fall these
men will be placed in the round be-
fore the semi-ﬁnal, where they will
meet the Winners in each division.

There has been .considerable agita-
tion lately -favoring the formation
of an honorary chess fraternity, sim-
ilar to those of other universities
and having the officers of the club
and team members elected to its
membership each year. This mat-
ter will be fully liscussed and de-
-cided upon at an early meeting next
-fall. ‘

 

FTAMINE IN [illlNA is

What the war did-to the universities
and colleges in this country and in
England, the present great famine is
doing to those in China. The stu-
dents are forsaking their classrooms
iniresp-onse to a call of need. A

 

S'evera'l of the Chinese colleges al-‘

ready have closed, and the students
have gone to the stricken districts in

the‘quickly mobilized army of relief '

workers through whose efforts many
among the millions left destitute by
ﬂood and drought are being kept alive
with food rushed in from the outside
world. . Q

In other institutions, where some
students will-remain, they are divid-
ing their food with the starving folk
of -the ﬁve stricken province-s. on the
“stint yourself to save” plan.

And this is one of the striking

signs of the awakening in the new

republic for which our own American
colleges are largely responsible.
Whatever progressive Western spirit
China has today, she owes to the
young men and women educated here

and in Europe, many of whose ex-'

penses at American universities and
colleges were paid for out of Boxer
indemnity money. Her hope for the
future rests with them and with the
students in the Chinese colleges mod-
eled after our own.

Before the call for men and women
willing to endure hardship and hard
work in famine relief became so ur-
gent, the 800 students of the Univer-
-sity of Nanking petitioned the auth-
orities of that institution to reduce
the amount of food served at the stu-
dent tables in order that what should

be saved might be sent to the famine

victims. -
They saved $800 duringthe ﬁrst

A half of the school year, besides con-

tributing more than $3,000 in cash.
$800 is a lot of money in China.
Board at the U. of N. costs about
$3.50 a month. No, not a day, or
week-—a month! Figure and ‘you’ll
see that the Chinese students really
stinted themselves. They saved a
good many lives. At current prices
in China, their $800 would buy 20 tons
ofsweet potatoes, 13 tons of millet,
5,000 pounds of meat, or 8,000 pounds
of/fish. .

Everywhere ‘Chinese students are
throwing themselves into the organiz-
ed effort to save their starving coun-
trymen. In Soochow University Num-
ber Three, a much smaller institution
than the U. of N., they saved $120 in
a month by denying themselves meat
and ﬁsh. Many of these same stu-
dents are now in the famine -provinces
busy with the tremendous work of
distribution. ,

From I-Iuchow comes word that the
government schools in that vicinity
raised 3. large amount of money by

,giving a series of entertain ents

which lasted a. weeln In Ne York
City they produced a Chinese play
and turned the proceeds‘ over to the
fund; ' ‘
