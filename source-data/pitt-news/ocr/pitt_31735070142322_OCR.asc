forced a Pitt student to pose on

Tuition tax vote
occurs today

Amid pressure from students and constituents,
City Council mobilizes to play peacekeeper

Drew Singer
Editor in Chief

Some City Council members want
this moming’s vote on the proposed
student tax to be tabled, which
would give oﬂicials more time to
explore alternatives.

In preparation for this morning’s
preliminary vote on the proposed
1 percent tuition tax, City Council
members spent their respective days
yesterday meeting with university
representatives and one another
well into the evening.

Councilwoman Tonya Payne —

whose district includes South Oak- .

land andDowntown — has previ-
ously shown support for the tax, but
said she’s keeping an open mind.

Payne, who met with representa-
tives from Pitt and Point Park yester—
day, said delaying the decision until
next week will gain much—needed
time for oﬂicials on both sides of
the debate.

“All of our goals are the same:
We don’t want to tax students,” she
said. “Getting to that goal may be
different for some of us, so we all
need to get to the same page to make
sure it happens.”

Payne‘ said she expected Coun-
cil members to work into the night
yesterday, vying for one another’s
votes. . '

. Pitt grad student Danieljimenez,
presidentof the Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Assembly, said he
was one of the people who met with

Council members yesterday.

“I think we got across to the
Council that this isn’t a fair tax and
students are already paying their
taxes,” he said. “It would have a
negative impact on students and the
public’s perception of the city.”

Jimenez said he expects today’s
10 a.m. vote to result in the tax being
tabled, but as of last night, the one-
week hold wasn’t a guarantee.

“I’m not sure that that’s going
to happen yet,” Payne said. “People
tend to fall off the bandwagon. We
need to make sure that we’re stick-

. ing together.”

While these developments come
less than one day after 150 students
ﬂooded a public hearing in protest
of the tax, Council members down-
played the seemingly sudden change
of direction, saying that changes
have been in the works for a while.

“It’s what we’ve been trying to do

' for over a month,” Councilwoman

Theresa Kail—Smith said. “We’re at
the point where we’re opening up
conversation.” -
Kail-Smith, who has shown
support for the tax in the past, said
she’s still lookingfor the right reso-
lution.
“I’m not changing my stance,”
she said, “but we’re working on it.”
Kail—Smith, whose district in-
cludes Mount Washington and
Crafton, said she was also one of
the Council members who met with
Pitt ofﬁcials today. ,

Board commends students
for protesting tax proposal

Erin Block
Staff Writer

Student Government Board members an-
nounced at last night’s meeting that they are
hopeﬁil for two things this week: the possible
postponement of the mayor’s Fair Share Tax and
the Pitt vs. Cincinnati football game. ,

Board president Kevin Morrison thanked
Nick Trainer, the Board’s governmental relations
chair, forhis work to lobby against the proposed
tax on Pittsburgh college students, which would
levy 1 percent of students’ tuition for the city.

Morrison said he’s excited about the progress
SGB made with the tax and the response from
Pitt students.

Trainer thanked students for participatingin
petitions and attending City Council meetings.
He said he hopes the Council’s vote, scheduled
today, will be postponed to a later date (see re-
lated story, page 1).

“If the tax is postponed, students will not see
the tax on the upcoming budget,” he said.

Trainer added that students have a “good
chance” of avoiding the tax.

Trainer also" said that Rep. Paul Costa, D-
Wilkins Township, will propose legislation to
prohibit any similar tax from happening any-

The state legislature might offer the city
of Pittsburgh an alternative to the student
tuition tax. - g

The Non—Proﬁt. Essential Services. Fee
Bill would allow municipalities to place a fee

on the real estate of nonproﬁt institutions,.

such as universities and hospitals, or allow
the institutions to continue with voluntary
contributions. The bill was referred to the
Senate Finance Committee last year, but two
state congressmen plan to reintroduce it.
State Sen. Wayne D. Fontana, D-Brooldine,
will reintroduce the bill that would amend
the Institutions of Purely Public‘Charity Act
that governs tax exemptions for nonproﬁt

i institutions. State Rep. Timothy Solobay,

D-Washington County, plans to introduce
a similar bill in the State House of Repre-
sentatives. ‘ l
. Fontana said that "he wants to start a gen-
uine discussion about_the role of nonproﬁt
institutions and their contributions to lo cal
municipalities. The nonproﬁt institutions
need to give some money in exchange for
the municipal services that they expect, he
said. . '
The bill would provide “another alterna-

tive for the problems on the table,” espe-
cially the controversial student tuition tax,
Fontana said: 7 e

The student tuition tax was the main sub-
jectyof a public hearing by City Council on

.. Monday, where officials and students from

various universities in Pittsburgh spoke out
against the tax.

Five members of City Council came out
in support of the student tuition tax, the

V necessary number of votes for it to pass, at

a press conference two weeks ago. Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl’s budget for 2010 does not
include revenue from the proposed tuition
tax, at the urging of the state—appointed.In-
tergovernmental Cooperation Authority.

Instead, the budget includes a series.of "

smaller budget cuts and source of new rev-

enue proposed by City Councilman William

Peduto and City Controller Michael Lamb.
Peduto opposed the student tuition tax,

‘saying’ that it was “illegal and off—target,” to

tax students rather than the institutions.

Ravenstahl said that he wanted to pur- .
sue the student tuition tax and have it in

the books before the end of the year. That
would give the city enough time to defend

a likely court challenge and collect the tax T I
in 2011, he said. '

Panera, County offer phone cards—for—cookies program

Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

Ifyou’re good to others, I’ll give you a cookie.

More accurately, if you donate an intema—
tional phone cardto servicemen overseas, Panera
Bread will give you a cookie.

partnered with Allegheny County for its sixth
annual phone card drive beneﬁting military per-
sonnel who hail from Western Pennsylvania.

People can drop off phone cards at any of
Pittsburgh’s 26 Panera Bread locations.

The phone cards will be distributed among
the 171st Air Refueling Wing, 911th Airlift Wing
and 316th Expeditionary Sustainment Command
of the Army Reserve.

Lt. Chris Preffer, of the 171st Air Reﬁieling
Wing, said soldiers typically have about 15 min-
utes to call home now and then, but the phone
cards allow deployed soldiers to avoid the long
wait times for the military’s provided morale
lines.

“You cangoto any public phones overseas,” he
said. “We give these to 1ow—ranking service men
who are making little money on the pay scale.”

He added that the military doesn’t authorize
personal cellphones insomeareas —-whichcan
be expensive abroad.

Larry Kuzmanko, director of Allegheny

County special events, said the drives raised
more than 100,000 phone card minutes in the
lastﬁve years, not includingthe 14,000 minutes
donated this year.

Preffer said that when the next group of
soldiers in the 171st Air Reﬁieling Wing leave in
March, they’ll deliver the cards to soldiers sta-
tioned in Iraq. Kuzmanko expects that with the
corporate partnership, therewillbe enough phone
cards raised to deliverin March and hopeﬁilly in
time for soldiers to use this holiday season.

Kuzmanko was one of the people who devel-
oped the phone card drive idea after he realized
that the conﬂicts abroad would continue.

“We certainly hope there’s adaywe don’t have
to do this,” he said.

Megan Dardanell, spokeswoman for Allegh-
eny County Executive Dan Onorato, said people
have sent domestic calling cards and money, but
intemational cards are preferred. Those who do
notwanttostop atPanera Bread maybringphone
cardstothe County Office Buildingorapark ofﬁce
located in Boyce, Hartwood, North, Round Hill,
Settler’s Cabin, South and White Oak.

People can also mail phone cards to the Al-
legheny County Special Events Office, 515-B

burgh, Pa. 15219.

not generate as much revenue for the city.

The bill exempts nonproﬁt institutions
with less than 50,000 square feet of real
estate. Every 1,000 square feet after that
could be taxed at up to $100, he said.

To determine the amount of revenue the
fee would bring Pittsburgh requires an au-
dit by Allegheny County to determine the
amount of nonproﬁt real estate that would
fall under the fee, Fontana said.

Based on an estimate of Pitt property
at its main campus in Central Oakland, the
proposed fee could cost the University less
than $1 million. If the cost were passed on
to students, they would pay about $33 each.
The currently proposed 1 percent tax would
charge undergraduate, in-state Arts and
Sciences students $135.

Mary Hines, president of the Pittsburgh
Council on Higher Education, said that the
universities would focus on the student tu-
ition tax before considering other propos-
als.

“Until the student tuition tax is off the
table, we will not talk about other solutions,”
Hines said. "

While the student tuition tax would di-
rectly impact students, Fontana said the
proposed real estate fee on nonproﬁts would
not necessarily hurt students or patients.
The institutions could choose to avoid rais-
ing the cost of tuition by making cuts in other
areas of their budgets.

Because the proposed fee would be based
on real estate, the amount that the fee costs
in the future would remain in the hands of
nonproﬁt groups, Fontana said.

“The institutions have the option to buy
or not buy. If they can’t afford the tax, then
they shouldn’t buy,” he said.

Outrage over tax to

bring wanted results

ittsburgh City Council heard

an earful — and rightly so

—— from a vociferous group
of 150 students from area schools,
such as Pitt, Carnegie Mellon,
Chatham University and Point
Park University, on Monday.

There’s no doubt about it. The
Council heard students’ message:
We’re mad.

Fortunately, student-speakers
said it more eloquently than that,
but with no less conviction. There’s
no denying the fervor behind a pe-
tition against the tax that spanned
10,150 names and the labeling of
the tax as “stupid” and “a hostage
situation.” But did the cries sink
in? More importantly, will they re-
sult in a nixing of the odious Fair
Share Tax?

So maybe it took the City of
Pittsburgh’s plundering into stu-
dents’ very own precious purses
in order to get such a historically
apathetic group motivated enough
to virtually storm the City-County
building. Nonetheless, they did
it, and it’s making a difference 
hopefully.

As of Monday, ﬁve of nine City
Council members supported the
Fair Share Tax. Now, some City
Council members want this morn-
ing’s vote to be tabled in order to
provide time to consider alterna-
tives.

This possible change of course
immediately follows Monday’s
heated meeting, and we’d like to
think this is a result of Council
members’ hearing students’ pleas.
Yet some members seem reluctant
to acknowledge students’ inﬂu-
ence.

“It’s what we’ve been trying
to do for over a month,” Council-
woman Theresa Kail-Smith told
The Pitt News. “We’re at the point
where We’re opening up for con-
versation,” she said.

It’s rare to see all the Pittsburgh-
area colleges united in such a way,
and it’s unfortunate our alliance
falls under such circumstances. Yet
we’ve shown our commitment as
a group, and let’s hope all schools
continue their efforts. The larger
the opposition to this tax, the more
likely we’ll see its elimination.

Monday’s meeting saw three

’Student Government Board

members-elect along with a vo-
cal SGB President-elect, Charlie
Shull, in attendance. Current SGB
President, Kevin Morrison, and
some Board members were also
in attendance. Part of SGB’s job
is to represent the student body
and ﬁght for the best interest of
students, and We’re glad current
members made the trip despite
their lame-duck standing.

Similarly, we hope Shull and in-'
coming board members keep up
their activism. They’re not quite
in the limelight yet, but now is
their time to start off right. Given
Pittsburgh’s economic standing
and ﬂuctuating tuition rates, SGB
members should have these city
ofﬁcials in their speed dials.

Shull told the Council that if they
instated the tax, he would seek to"
unite the Pitt student body against
Council members during the next
election. Students have shown they
have a voice, and they’re not afraid
to start yelling. Pittsburgh council
members, listen up.

take action and participate in city
politics. Monday’s public hearing
before City Council was packed
with students who testiﬁed to the
unfairness of the proposed tax
while other students carried signs
reading “No Taxation Without
Representation,” the Wall Street
Journal reported.

Although students’ general op-
position to the tax and the remarks
made by SGB members were pre-
dictable, the use of “No Taxation
Without Representation” as a rally-
ing cry represents something new

' in campus activism.

Indeed, there are countless
student groups at Pitt dedicated
to improving the lives of others,
to stopping human rights abuses
internationally and to combating
“oppression” in its various guises,

but it’s rare to see students acting
to preserve their individual liber-
ties. '
Individual liberty is a value that
ﬁnds little place in an academic
environment that tends to em-
phasize globalism, volunteerism
and guilt where the sins of our

American forebears are extrapo-

lated as broad indictments against
American society today. Academia
focuses disproportionately on
the suffering of various historical
victims and tends to ignore the
accomplishments of individuals
outside of victim communities.
Interestingly, academia’s focus
on the victim and the oppressed
tends to create an environment
where students are identiﬁed as
privileged members of a corrupt
society that’s moral duty is to bet-
ter the lives of others around the
world. For this reason, thousands
of students dedicate their time and
energy to alleviating conﬂicts in
Darfur and Palestine or easing
the suffering of the poor and the

hungry.

After all, we are privileged
members of a rich society and
are morally bound to give back.
Aren’t we?

It’s this self—imposed percep-
tion of privilege that Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl tapped into when he
created the Fair Share_Tax argu-
ing that university students are
“privileged” to be receiving an

_ education and should give back

to those around them who are less
fortunate. In this case, the less for-
tunate happens to mean the city of
Pittsburgh — a city that’s govern-
ment is too poor to pay for city
services and workers’ pensions by
itself and needs the privileged to
step in and help out.

Ravenstahl’s tax is the logical
conclusion drawn from the culture
of self-sacriﬁce that dominates
college campuses. But with the
needy closer to home and lacking
a compelling historical narrative
of oppression by white men, col-
lege students are less inclined to
help out.

Interestingly, students and aca-

important value and a motive force

tive city government.

The narrative that students

have adopted in their ﬁght against

the tax is as old as the foundation l

of this republic and relies heav-
ily on the language of individual
rights and a largely libertarian,
anti-tax attitude. The problem is
that students decided to portray
themselves as citizens only after
ﬁnancial pressure forced them to
abandon the college cult of self-
sacriﬁce.

But I do believe that there are
students in the mass of those
opposing the tax who genuinely
believe in the rhetoric of liberty
that was heard in Monday’s Coun-
cil meeting, and I think that these
voices that have risen in defense of
students as citizens deserve to be
recognized and encouraged.

For this reason and others,
I’ve started an essay contest on

Wednesday, and then the issue will
be out of our hands and into the
courts. But before we return to the
way things were before the student
tax roused us, we need to examine
whether the old campus culture of
guilt-ridden self-sacriﬁce is still
viable or whether we should cre-
ate a new academic culture that
emphasizes individuallibertyand _
well-being over the good of distant
others.

We must push forward andfully'

riﬁce so that we can fully protect
our individual liberties as citizens
of this city, state and nation.

Reminiscing freshman year

Missing Market Central’s ready-made meals and moments of mishaps

 
   

Katie Azzara
Columnist

[There is a certain phrase that car-

ries with it such power and signif-
icance that at Pitt, sophomores,
juniors. and seniors alike can be

_ heard uttering it on various oc-

casions. This phrase connotes a
strong sense of superiority and
-self-congratulation to the speaker

"while shaming the subject to an

extreme degree. The phrase?
“That’s so freshman year.”

j If you aren’t guilty of saying it
yourself, you’vé‘probably heard
it around campus. There’s just
something so satisfying about not
being a freshman, even if — like
me — you’re a sophomore, which
is only one small step away.

The ability to attribute any and
"all embarrassing, immature or

just plain silly behavior to fresh-

men is a small sort of triumph for
older students. And being able
to dismiss certain things — at-
tending frat parties, eating at
Market Central and traveling in
giant packs — as being “so fresh-
man year” seems to give us non-
freshmen an inexplicable sense
of satisfaction. But while we rec-
ognize the need to construct our
identities against lowly freshmen,
most of us have yet to realize ex-
actly why this is so necessary.

I have a theory. Listen closely,
freshmen, because I’m about to
let you in on a secret: We older
students envy you.

Sure, there are beneﬁts to be-
ing a non-freshman. We ﬁnally get
the freedom to move off campus,
but that comes with the added
stress of monthly payments and
navigating the Oakland loop.

In reality, we miss living in

Towers and busing everywhere
—— especially those of us who
now have to deal with rent and
parking. In all honesty, the best
thing about not being a freshman
is probably making fun of those
who are.

For us non-freshman, gone are
the days of walking downstairs
and grabbing a pre—made grilled
cheese sandwich at midnight. As
much as I hate to admit it, go-
ing to_Market Central is a special
treat these days. Not only does
it bring back fond memories of
freshman year, but it also means
we don’t have to’ cook.

Listen closely,
freshmen, because
I’m about to let you in
on a secret: We older
students envy you.

‘ We even miss experiences
that once seemed disastrous but
are now dear memories, such as

being stranded in the freezing

cold for hours at the Waterfront,
SouthSide Works or Kennywood
—— and the list‘ goes on — waiting
for a bus.

The end of freshman year
can be traumatizing, and being
a sophomore is odd in that you
no longer have a distinct place
within the college world the way
that freshmen do. You are forced
to enter into a strange sort of Fri-
day-night limbo between being
too old for fraternity parties and
too young for bars.

We become slightly lost, and

we choose to embrace our mem-
ories of freshman year. We try
wishing them back into existence,
because wishing to be older would
mean being closer to graduating
—,something that no college stu-
dent really wants. We all miss be-
ing freshmen as we creep closer
and closer to entering the real
world and make decisions about
courses, majors and careers.

So my advice to freshmen is
to live it up while you can. Rather
than being embarrassed by the

"fact that you’re a f1rst—year stu-

dent at Pitt, take advantage of
your desirable position. Don’t
worry, about the real world,’your
major or graduation. There will
be plenty. of time for that in the
coming years.

It’s OK if you make a fool out
of yourself or act immature,
because, after all, you’re just a
freshman. The rest of us have no
excuses‘. And if we snicker at you
and say, “He must be a freshman,”
when you ask for directions, or
use the classicyline “That’s so
freshman year,” when discuss-
ing plans for the weekend, don’t
be offended. Be ﬂattered instead.
We’re just jealous.

On textsfromlastnight.com, I
once read a particularly compel-
ling entrythat said something
along the lines of, “I spent all day
watching freshmen move in and
yelling ‘Trade lives with me!’” I
totally get where this anonymous
texter was coming from. He must
be one of the lost, confused, envi-
ous upperclassmen.

Freshmen, I think we’d all
trade lives with you if we could,
myself included. So —- any tak-
ers?

Engineer Cecil Balmond has a me-

The exhibit, “H_edge,” demon-

architecture and engineering.
.Balmond is an engineer of inter-

national recognition who has worked

with many architects globally, as well

- as some artists, accordingto Raymund

Ryan, architecture curator at Carnegie

“The key point on ‘H_edge’ is it’s
aninstallation,” Ryan said. “It’s alaby-
rinth. The intentionispeoplewillenjoy
wandering through this thing but be
puzzled how. it stays vertical.”

The structure seems so simple, yet
it forms an elaborate and decorative
maze. It’s composed of around 6,000
aluminum plates suspended between
stainless—steel chains, which look like

‘metallicivyhangingfromthinair. ’

The trick isrthat it’s standing ﬁ‘om '

“The edges of leaves are inserted

Ryan said. “It’s very light, but itcreates

It’s strong and delicate at the same

“The end product, because it is so
thought—out and more than applied
science, becomes an art object in and

Born in Sri Lanka, Balmond is
deputy chairman of Arup, the inter-
national design consultantﬁrm based
in London. Despite Balmond not be-

Ryanbelieves “H_edge”is anantiquing
structure.

In addition to the actual metallic
structure, there is amirror onthewall
thatvisually elongates the maze, aswell
as several information boxes, called
light boxes, on the walls that contain

designs and information about engi— '
V neering principles.

For example, Balmond explains in
shortﬁlms embedded within the light
boxes, the ﬁactal “is a geometric idea
that repeats at different scales.”

that in my elementary-school glory I -

realized shoes were pretty great.

My roommate and I were in New

formative quality of shoes. Few other
articles of fashion possess an equal
ability to step—up your outﬁt. You can

This is why I’m-rnorally opposedto
ﬂip-ﬂops and those icky brown clogs.
They don’t do anything for any outﬁt
you could possibly hope to pull off. 1
I’ve seen many outﬁts ruined by the

I Let’s not even get started on Crocs
and those MB’I‘ (Masai Barefoot Tech-

to improve your posture. You should
know by now that these are simply
unacceptable.

Also, wearing ﬂip-ﬂopsto aformal

portant numbers and other ideas and patterns.

Informative as this may be, there’s another
goal of the exhibit.

“It should be somewhat mysterious,” Ryan
said. “We try to get the lighting right. We want
the natural light there, as well, when possible.
The light should bounce around the complicated
structure and create a sense of mystery.”

All of this information and mystery is tucked
into a single room, going by the oﬂicial name
“Forum 64: H_edge,” because Balmond’s instal-
lation is No. 64 to go through the separated ex-
hibition space.

The room sits between the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History and the Carnegie Museum of
Art. The little room usually holds contemporary

works of artwith just one or two pieces, creating
ateaser for the visitors.

“‘H_edge’ appeals to the core historic mission
of Carnegie Museums ofPit1sburgh: the advance-
ment of art and science,” Ryan said. “It plays to
the issue of arts and sciences coexisting.”

On Saturday Nov. 21, a Pitt Arts—sponsored
trip included a guided tour of the exhibit along “
with lunch at the Museum Café.

This exhibitiontakes placeﬁnm Nov. 14, 2009
to May 30, 2010 inthe Forum Gallery of the Car-
negie Museum of ArtinPittsburgh. Balmondwill
also give a lecture Feb. 6, 2010.

  Prince-Wright to try out for international games

Junior Joe Prince—Wright was invited for the second straight time to try out for England’s team for the World University Games

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

While it might have been a disap-
pointing season for the Pitt men’s
soccer team, the play of at least one of
its members did not go unnoticed.
Juniorjoe Prince—Wright was re-
cently invited to compete with 30
other British—based players in the
United States in the British Univer-
sity Team trials, which will deter-
mine the team for Great Britain in

e the 2011 World University Games

held in Chir1a. The University Games
are the third-largest event after the
Olympics and the Asian Games.
Prince—Wright is the ﬁrst Pitt player
ever invited to the trials.
Prince—Wright, hailing from
Southampton, England, also com-
peted in the 2008 team trials forthis
year’s team, as the games take place

every other year. As the youngest
player in the ﬁeld, Prince—Wright did
not make the ﬁnal roster.

“The experience from last year’s
trials made me realize thatl can com-
pete with the top players in England,”
Prince—Wright said. “It gave me con-
ﬁdence knowing that I can compete
at that level.”

Competing against numerous se-
niors and post-graduate students in
the previous trials, the competition
was stiff. Yet Prince—Wright at least
left a lasting impression going into
the upcoming tryouts, as he scored
the lone goal in a 1-0 scrimmage.

While happy with his perfor-
mance the last time around, Prince-
Wright knows that he needs to show
even more in next December’s trials.
“I feel like I need to make a bigger
impression,” he said.

Prince-Wright burst onto the ra-

dar of the British University Games’
coaches when he scored two goals in
a game against Seton Hall last season
in which an English coach was in at-
tendance.

The coach contacted Pitt head I

coachjoe Luxbacher to ﬁnd out more
about the then—sophomore.

He has nine points in 22 career
starts in his three-year career at Pitt,
while primarily playing midﬁeld af-
ter an accomplished prep career in
England, where he was a member
of the ﬁve—time Southampton City
Cup championship team ,and also
earning the 1999-2000 Sportsman
of the Year Award. .

Prince—Wright is conﬁdent that
he can improve enough to make the
team next year as he has plenty of
time to improve over the course of an
entire summer as well as his senior
season at Pitt. ~

For one last time, Mellon Arena will
board up its ice for a night and host
a college basketball game as the
Pitt men’s basketball team takes on
Duquesne tonight at 7.

Out of the 77 times the City Game
has been played, 34 games have taken

* placeatMellonArena, thelasta78-63

Pitt win on Dec. 22, 2oo1.
“It’s very special to play the last
game at Mellon Arena,” junior guard

Brad Wanamaker said Monday. ‘‘It’s A

great for the city, for both teams and

- r the universities."

The Panthers (5-1) have dominated
the rivalry, both recently and through-
out its history. Pitt holds a 46-31 lead
all-time, including the last eight vic-
tories. The longest winning streak on
either sidewaswhen Pittwon nine ina

I rowfrom1982-1988.TheDukes’ (5-1)

longest winning streak is four, which
they’ve achieved on three separate
occasions.

However, the last time Duquesne
beat Pitt was at the Mellon Arena on

8- Dec. 21, 2000. The Dukes won 71-70.

Duquesne’s Aaron Lovelace hit a shot

to give the Dukes a lead with a little
more than two seconds remaining.
After Duquesne accidentally sent six
defenders onthe court afteratimeout
and were called for a technical foul,
Pitt’s freshman guardjulius Page went
to line forawould—be game-tyingﬁee
throw, but missed.

“Thatwas unique,” said Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon, who at that timewas sﬁll
an assistant coach under Ben How-
land. “Itwas a tough loss.”

While thosewerethelasttwo times
the City Game was at Mellon Arena,
Pitt has played there afew times since.
Pittwonitsﬁrsttwo games ofthe 2002
NCAA Tournament at Mellon Arena,
71-54 against Central Connecticut
State and 63-50 against California.
All-time at Mellon Arena, Pitt is 61-51.
Duquesne, which used Mellon Arena
asits home from 1964-1988, is247-107
in the building.

Even though the two teams only
play once in the regular season, the
players are quite familiar with one
another.

“They play against each other all
the time,” Dixon said.

Wanamaker said players com-
pete during the summer league in
Greentree, at open gyms and in

»Mel/on Arena to host City Game for

pickup games with one another. Even
though he added thathe thinks Pitt
and Duquesne players are closer and
talk more than in past years, it’s still
a rivalry.

“Anythingwe do with them is per-
sonal, so playingwiththemina game
with referees is goingto be even more
intense,” Wanamaker said.

Dixon is close with Duquesne
coach Ron Everhart, even saying that
he roots for Duquesne “when they’re
not playing us.” Still, Dixon said this
game is more for the players than
coaches.

“This is for bragging rights in the
city,” center Gary McGhee said.

If McGhee wants the bragging
rights this year, he ﬁgures to be a big
factor tonight, as he’ll partly have the
task of guarding Duquesne forward
Damian Saunders. .

“He canplay on the perimeter, but
he’s their biggest guy on the ﬂoor,”
Dixon said.

Saunders is averaging 16.8 points
per game and is second in the nation
with 15.5 rebounds a game.

“He usually starts out onthewing,

just runs in and gets a lot of tip-out

rebounds,” McGhee said.
The Panthers also have to worry

Coming off tournament sweep, Panthers travel to Ohio

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

Balanced scoring proved important for the
Pitt women’s basketball team, as it defeated
Appalachian State and Marshall to win its
annual Thanksgiving Tournament over the
holiday break.

The Panthers (5-0) look to continue their
equal attack when they travel to Youngstown
State tonight to take on the Penguins (0-6)
at 7:05 p.m. in their ﬁrst game away from the
Petersen Events Center all year.

Jania Sims, Chelsea Cole and Shayla Scott
were named to the All-Tournament Team,
with Sims also earning the tournament
MVP.

“Jania Sims deserved MVP, but Shayla
Scott and Chelsea Cole were fabulous,” head
coach Agnus Berenato said. “It’s a compli-
ment that all of the coaches voted for three
players from the University of Pittsburgh.”

Sims scored 14 points and racked up six
assists against Marshall, while scoring 16
and dishing out four assists against Appa-
lachian State. '

Scott notched a double—double against Ap-
palachian State, with a career—high 17 points
and 11 rebounds. She added 11 points against

Marshall.

“I’ve been struggling the past couple of
practices and not feeling as conﬁdent in my-
sel ,” Scott said following the victory over
Appalachian State. “I took a deep breath be-
fore the game and realized that what is in the
past is in the past. I need to have conﬁdence
and knock down shots and to get rebounds
and assists.”

Cole followed Scott’s double—double with
one of her own against Marshall, when she
scored 11 points and grabbed'11 rebounds.
She almost reached a double—double against
Appalachian State, with 10 points and nine
boards.

While leading scorer Taneisha Harrison
struggled against Appalachian State with nine
points on 4—of-17 shooting, she came back
to lead the Panthers with 15 points against
Marshall.

“She saw the opportunity to be aggressive,”
Berenato said. “We look to her to be a scorer.
I was happy to see her bounce back.”

Youngstown State returns one starter
and ﬁve letter winners from last year’s team,
which ﬁnished 3-27 overall and 1-17 in the
Horizon League.

Four of the ﬁve returning players and ﬁve
of the eight Penguin newcomers are members
of the backcourt, so the Penguins ﬁnd most

of their depth in the guard positions.

Sophomore guard Macey Nortey is the
only returning starter for Youngstown State.
She started 25 games last season, while aver-
aging 5.6 points in 26.8 minutes per game.

Junior Bojana “Boki” Dimitrov, a transfer
from Carl Albert State College, averaged 10
points and 4.5 assists as a sophomore point
guard for the Vikings.

The Penguins have only three true post
players on their roster, including senior Ra-
chael Manuel.

Not only is Manuel the most experienced
frontcourt presence for the Penguins, she’s
also the veteran leader of the squad, having
played in 85 games while averaging 1.9 points
and 2.1 rebounds.

6—foot—3 Manuel is the tallest Penguin, the
next tallest being freshman forward Kaitlin
Rohrs, at 6 feet 1 inch, who hasn’t played
at all this season. Fellow freshman Brandi
Brown is the only other frontcourt player
for Youngstown State, standing at 5 feet 11
inches. She’s the team’s leading rebounder,
averaging 9.8 boards per game. Of Brown’s
59 total rebounds this season, 26 have come
on the offensive side of the ﬂoor.

With such a depleted frontline, the Pan-
thers could use their size to dominate down
low. Led by 6-foot-6 center Shawnice “Pep-

Panthers need to limit turnovers

City Game 4 14

about guarding Bill Clark, who averages 18.3
points a game. The Dukes leading scorer is Mel-
quan Bolding, who is averagingzs points a game
after playing in just the ﬁrst game this year and
then breaking his right wrist.

Dixon also said the Dukes “play srn .” Of
the six players averaging more than 10 minutes
a game, Saunders is the tallest at 6 feet7 inches,
but even he doesn’t spend too much time down
low. ’

“He’s veryversatile,” Wanamaker said. “Gary
and Nas [Robinson] are going to have to step

out on the wing and guard him. It’s going to be
achallenge forall of us.” ~ V

Duquesne plays withafairly uptempo offense
and likes to run a lot.

“They playwith no post,” Dixon said. “Teams
that do that are planning to shoot the three and
spread the ﬂoor.”

D Clarkis the most likely to shoot from beyond
the arc, leadingthe teamin3—pointers taken (46)
and 3—pointers made (14). Jason Duty is next
most likely to shoot a 3—pointer, hitting 9-of—29
attempts this year. BJ. Monteiro hasn’t taken

many 3—pointers, only nine this year, but he has
hit four of them for a 44.4 shooting percentage
ﬁom long range. ‘

For the Panthers to win, they must cut down

on turnovers. In two of Pitt’s last three games, it ,

has ﬁnished with more tumovers than assists.
Oddly enough, the only game where that didn’t
happen, Pitt had the same number of assists-to-
turnovers and lost 78-62 to No. 3 Texas.

“Our main goal has been improvement
throughout the year, and through six games this
year we’ve improved,” Dixon said.

and 6—foot-"3 forward Kate Popovec, the Pan-
thers tower over the Penguins. Pitt also has
three more players on its roster who are at
least 6 feet tall. l

In the Panthers”ﬁve games this year,

they’ve only been out—rebounded twice. St. _
Francis hauled in one more rebound and-

Appalachian State brought down six more
missed shots than Pitt. Youngstown State is
getting out-rebounded by 9.8 rebounds per
game this year. .

Youngstown State is currently on a season-
long, six-game losing streak, includinga70-51
loss to Weber State on Saturday. The closest
ﬁnal score so far this year for the Penguins is
a 76-67 loss at Louisiana—Monroe. Every other
loss has been by at least 12 points.

Nortey led the Penguins with 15 points and ‘

six assists in the loss, while Manuel added 11
points and six rebounds.

Dimitrov contributed eight points.

Youngstown State shot 35.1 percent against
