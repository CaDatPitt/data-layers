Kramer Says University

“Think-Tank’ Can Aid City

(Continued from Page 1)
When questioned if the. city had

» a role in providing parking facili-

ties for Oakland, the Democratic
candidate reminisced, “I walked

to school from where I lived —

it was to miles.” He felt that

“there are plenty of parking spaces
within a mile of the University

now.”

When asked what student ac-
tions would precipitate city in-
tervention, the morality candidate
replied,” the University should
call for help . . . but if the city
sees that there is a clear and pre-
sent danger” it should act. Kra-
mer refused to comment on the
use of billie clubs and police
dogs in the spring melee on the
Towers patio last year. As a judge
he felt any answer would require
a full presentation of the facts
of the incident.

The residents of Oakland are
concerned about the encroach-
ment by the University in its ex-
pansion plans. Judge Kramer sees
a need for a new approach to
tax exempt” institutions, since
one-third of the property in the
city is tax-exempt.

When asked how he would favor
any rezoning of Oakland and fu-
ture development, Kramer neatly
side-stepped any position by
pointing out that “each case (for
rezoning) is handled separately.
“The people who have had
their homes here’ for fifty
years must be-taken into consi-
deration.”

continued to list five areas
in which American policy must
be examined.

Morganthau first discussed
the problem‘ of our allies and
NATO. When NATO was first
proposed, it was a “necessity”
for Europe because the US,

with its nuclear ‘power, was “an .

umbrella of security for Europe.”
The situation has changed, how-
ever, and now the US and Europe
have “unmatched interests.”

“The US must make up its
mind” in European policy, he
declared. “We must make com-
mon our interests or develop a
more intimate relation and coor-
dinate our foreign policies.”
Morganthau sees “no vital role
for NATO” in the future.

Another problem area are the
communists, said Morganthau.
Today the communists are a “pol-
icentric” force,’ which has adapt-
ed itself to specific aims in each
country. As for Vietnam, the US
must first define what kind of com-
munism is in that country and
then “decide what is the hear-
ing of this kind of communism on
the interests of the US.” He ex-

plained that a “philosophical op-
position” does not necessarily
mean “political and military op-

position” as well.position” as well.”

In the area of underdeveloped
countries, Morganthau said that
the US should adopt a policy of
siding with the Latin American
Church, which is on the side of
the revolution against Commun-
ism. He stated that we do not have
a choice “between the status quo
and a revolution, but between
revolution and revolution.” Fur-
thermore, “we have to reorient
ourselves to Asia, Africa, and La-
tin America.”

Morganthau also advocated
that a “radical rethinking is need-
ed to adjust the foreign: policy to
the possibility of nuclear war.”
He called the Anti-Ballistic Mis-

sile System a “piece of junk”

which reflects “archaic mode’ of
thought . . . . there is no defense
against nuclear war.” When ques-
tioned about the possibility* of war-
fare with Red China, he stated,
“If and when Red China is a ma-
jor nuclear power, it.wil1 be as
vulnerable to nugcler attack as we
are. We can only rely on Red
China’s rationality.”* ‘

Suppression and

Liberation

by Dave Tiernan,
Editor

According to various literature coming
across my desk lately, the problem facing
the advocates of the 18-year-old vote are
very similar to those faced here by the ad-
vocates of student power.

As one interested graduate student noted

recently, “When you present your demands
or speak your rightful say and turn around
to see that your fellow students aren’t
standing behind you, you feel rather fool-
ish.” '
- MANY STUDENT . LEADERS must
feel awful lonely, too. I know I often sit
down here to write something and feel that
it’s a horrible waste of time. The 18-year-
old vote supporters must feel the same.

Think how futile it must seem to them
when they have to produce pages and pages
of literature just to get teens off their fat
behinds to support a cause that is probably
the most legitimate cause they will ever
have to champion.

If the majority of 18, 19, and 20-year-
olds got together and showed their cong-
ressmen ' that they wanted the vote, it

i’ > would be delivered ina matter of months.

SO, T00, IF the majority of students
here voiced an opinion in public about the
way in which this university is run, it
wouldn’t be long before they would have
more than a token representation of various
committees and councils.

After realizing that very, very few late
teens voice their opposition to the manda-
tory draft, the whole problem seems to be

Reflections of the Spleen '

 

 

by MARC SIMON
Staff News Writer

Since there really hasn’t been much to

1 do since the winter term let out, I’ve been

trying to find new amusements. I’m sure
many of you are in the same position. Well,
I think I’ve discovered (or perhaps redis-
covered) a new kick —— pin-ball machines.
But let me warn you: don’t become too in-
volved with them or you’ll find yourself

.. hooked before you know it. I know. I’m a

cured pin-bal1_ addict. In fact, I wouldn't
be here today if it weren’t for that wonder-
ful group, Pin-Ball Autonomous. They
pulled.me out of the arcade just in time.

Itwas a musty Saturday morning. I’d ‘
been up practically all night, trying to
“make a score” (that means win a game in
regular talk). My unshaved face was drawn
and wrinkled, my eyes were dull, my tongue
was dry, and my hands were shaking. I look-
ed at my index fingers and saw the hor-
rid red indentations that come from using
-the flippers so much, a sure sign of a pin-
ball addict, or, as the hip people call them,
a “jangly.” I tried to make my clouded
mind think clearly, but all I coqd recall
was the few games I had won when my
score’s last humber . had matched the
machine -— the cheap way to win. How many
games had I played the night before, how
many nickels, dimes, and quarters had I
thrown away, just to hear that magic “pop,”
the signal of a free game?

I dragged my weary boddy to the front
of the store, and with ten of my last twen-
ty cents bought a box of jujubees. You can
tell if a person is a jangly is he is constant-
ly eating jujubees — they're the only food a

I hardened jangly really craves. This is be-

cause they come in a variety of colors,
which reminds the jangly of lighted specials,
and because they are small and can be
“popped” into the mouth, which has a quasi-
similarity to “popping”
free games.

, I quickly popped a few jujubees (the
red ones really “tripped” me) and walked
toward the “Airport” machine, the one I
could never beat. The store owner tried to
stop me. “Don’t you know when you’ve
had enough?” he cried. “You lousy jangly,
you’re throwing you life away!” But I

that because we are suppressed from child-
hood by parents, teachers and the govern-
ment, we come to easily accept the usurp-
ing of our rights. We even become so pro-
grammed that we fail to become vocal when
there is a chance of our supressors listen-
ing to us.

Possibly college students would rather
wait a few years and become suppressors
in the form of parents, teachers, and mem-
bers of the military-industrial complex than
work for their liberation now.

LOOK AT WHERE you’re going
though. Industry says it agaees that the
war in Vietnam is not too groovy, but what
actin have they taken to stop it? If late
teens are waiting to become suppressors,
what is industry waiting for? Maybe the
good money and good life and good cars
and good homes and good country clubs make
up for their role as the government’s nig-
ger.

And, believe it or not, the government
faces the same problem that all the other
groups face. Due to the lack of participa-
tion by .people in this grand and glorious
country, the government must play the
role of nigger to the rest of theworld
insteadof working to improve the condition
in its own back yard.

Look at the news media. Look at all the
attention a group of campus radicals is
getting. through the media, and in turn by
the government. And now public service
groups such as the American Legion and
Playboy magazine are turning their ef-
forts toward the discontented students.
What would the response be if a group
of citizens raised a stink about their sup-
pression and gained‘ support from other
citizens as the college radicals have?
Maybe the roles would reverse and priori-
ties would be shuffled around and some-

V thing constructive would be done.

SIGNS DON'T INDICATE it will
happen in my lifetime, but then again, who
knows how the next generation will act
to suppression.

couldn’t listen to him. All my attention
was geared to “Airport.” I'll beat you this
time, you bastard. You'll pop for me or I'll
tilt you like you’ve never been tilted be-
fore.

I reached into my filthy pants (jangles
don’t care about their personal appear-
ance) for my dime, but to my my horror
it was gone. I frantically searched all my
clothibg for it. I got down on my hands and
knees and grovelled all over the floor try-
ing to recover the dime, but it wasn’t
there. Finally I collapsed into a corner in a
severe withdrawal, my wrists and fingers
jumping as if they were actually shaking.

register rang I imagined it to be a one-

‘thousand point special. I spasmodically

chewed my jujubees, but they began to
stick in mythroat. I’d never been this bad
before. I started screaming, “I need a dime,
I need a dine!!” but no one paid any at-
tention.

Just then" a tall young man who was
neatly dressed and groomed bent over me
and said in a kindly voice,” I’m here to help
you. I've been through what you’re go-
ing through now, so I know how you feel.
I’m from Pin-Ball Autonomous.”

Sure, I'd heard of the place, but I
never believed in it. But I knew he was on
the level, because I saw the flipper scars
on his index fingers. Also, he was smoking
a cigarette, the«Pin-B all ‘Autonomous sub-
situte for jujubees. I raised my hand to him
the first act on my road back.

Well, it wasn’t easy, but I’ve re-
covered, thanks to Pin-Ball Automonous.
I can now walk by a pin-ball machine
and not want to play it, and even if I do
want to play it I can quit whenever I
want. I no longer crave jujubees, either.

Handicapped Were Not Considered
iln The University's Building Plans

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer
“The United States leads the world in
the amount of health and welfare expen-
ditures and activities, and yet the incidence
of disease, disability and premature

death continues to rise ‘every year, and
these statistics increase in percentage as
“Senator Rob-

well as absolute numbers.
ert Kennedy. July 13, 1966

Although 13 per
cent of the U. 5. pop-
ulation not residing
in institutions is han-
dicapped, this sector
of the population is
not covered by any
of the Civil Rights
Acts, Minimum Wage _ ,
Laws, Insurance, or  '
Fair Housing Stan- Mlss STONE
ards. Many of them are rejected from
schools and universities.

    

This is the first of a series of articles
concerning the various problems of the
handicapped. It will deal with some of the
problems of handicapped students at the
University. A

The architects who designed most of the
University’s buildings have failed to in-
clude adequate prvisions for handi-
capped students. Primarily, there are but
few ramps along the curbs of University
sidewalks. This includes Forbes Ave.
where there are no curb cuts leading to
the library. .

The modern Hillman Library poses
many problems for the handicapped. There
is no ramp out onto the sundeck. The nar-
rrowness of the book stacks inhibits wheel
chair maneuverability. In addition,
the restrooms, although equipped with a
stall with a handrail, are very hard to get
into.

The Common Facilities Building has
excellent provisions for the handicapped
but there are no curb cuts to get there eas-
ily. Unfortunately, Heinz Chapel and Ste-
phen Foster Memorial are almost complete-

ly inaccessible to the handicapped.

Wheelchair students can easily enter the
Cathedral. However once inside, they face
a multitude of problems. There is no rail-
ing in the one accessible rest room in the
entire building. The door is 22”
wide as
compared to the 32 ” minimum set by the
Architectural Barriers Acts. ‘

There are no handicapped engineer-
ing students, probably because Engineer-
ing Hill presents too many obstacles. When
the new school is finished, hopefully,
this will change. The Human Energy Re-
search Lab in Trees Hall was originally
designed for handicapped students. How-
ever, it is never used by them because there
is no available transportation to Trees for
handicapped students.

It.took four years for the University to
build wheelchair ramps between the Cathe-
dral and Clapp Hall. It took the Uni-
versity one month to put in steps from the
Quadrangle to the Student Union for the
express purpose of controlling students dur-
ing riots.

This year, the school signed a ten-
year lease for the Koch Apts on Center

Ave. for graduate students. It is spend-
ing huge sums of money to renovate the
building and yet is is not including ele-

G

vators or ramps which would make the hous-

ing accessible to handicapped grad stu-

, dents. By doing so, not only is -the Uni-

versity causing some students a great deal
of inconvenience, but it is also breaking
a law.

The next time a student walks to Hill-
man, the Cathedral or Engineer-
ing Hill, he should look at the architectural
barriers facing these students and
multiply them by 100. He may then get
some idea of what it is to be like a wheel-
chair at the University.

Before the end of May, there will be a
meeting of graduate and undergraduate
students, faculty, representatives from the
Home for Cripple Children, St. Francis
Hospital, Harmarville Rehabilita-
tion Center, Penn Rehabilitation Center
at Hohnstown, and Open Doors for the Han-
dicapped, with the administration of the
University. The purpose of this meeting
is to find out what the University’s- at-
titude is towards the handicapped and to
elicit from it a committment policy con-
cerning these students. At this meeting,
representatives of student health, housing
and admissions will speak.

The Conversion of Paul

Editor, The Pitt News,

I wish to make this public protest to
the filthy and blasphemous language used
in Paul Stoller’s recent column about grad-
uation day. I can sympathize with his feel-
mgs about the boredom experienced at
such an event but I cannot condone -his

“overreaction” by using profanity and blas- -W

pheming the names of my heavenly Fa-
ther and my personal Savious, Jesus
Christ.

When people have to use profanity
and blasphemy to express themselves, two
facts are obvious: (1) they lack the nec-
essary culture and education to express
themselves in a manner befitting those who
deserve to graduate, and (2) they do not have
a personal relationship with God through
His Son, Jesus Christ.

This Jew called Jesus Christ was the
One who died in Calvary’s Cross for sin-
ners — and we’re all sinners! He was the
One who shed.His precious blood so that
we might never know the torments of an
eternal Hell and ultimate Lake of Fire.
Yes, the Lord Jesus Christ means more to
me than life itself and I wish Paul Stoller
yvould let my Savious beome his Savious

Nashville Country

Dylan Changes His Style

by BRUCE LEVENSON
‘Associate Editor

The ever-evolving Bob Dyland

has added another dimension to
his musical genius in his latest
album Nashville Country. A folk
singer in origin, Dylan added rock

elements to his style a few years I

ago in creating a distinct new
mode — folk rock. This new al-
bum marks the addition of coun-
try music to his repertoire and
the emergence of a new Dylan
sound, a synthesis of folk, rock,
and country.

The harsh vocals, cynical lyrics,
and frenzied guitar and harmon-
ica that characterized previous
Dylan collections have been aban-
done in favor of a mellow,
smoother vocal style, light-heart-
ed, messageless tunes, with a
highly seasoned country flavoring
on the instrumentals. In spite of
the changes, the ten new Dylan
orginals remain distinctively Bob
Dylan.

The country-folk synthesis is
no more prevalent that on the in-
strumental selection “Nashville
Skyline Rag.” This gay, well-con-
structed basically country melody
features Dylan playing folk guitar
and folk harp interludes. Banging
country piano keys tie the entire
tune together.

The folk rock flavored country
guitar provides the only accom-
paniment for Dylan and guest ar-
tist Johnny Cash on “Girl from the
North Country.” Country music

_ great Cash and Dylan trade the

first verses of the enchanting
composition and join voices on the
last two. Dylan’s new voice, a
combination that smacks of Gom-
er Pyle and Al Jolson, contrasts
with Cash’s deep resonance to
produce a hauntingly melodic ef-
fect.

unteers will be provided with

The enchanting characteristic '

of the Dylan vocals also prevails
in “Lay, Lady, Lay,” possibly the
best cut on the album. The artist
complements this piece by pro-
ducing notes from his guitar that
seem to whine.

The catchy “Tell Me That It Isn’t

True” and the soothing ballad, “I ‘

Threw It All Away” are enhanced
by an organ playing in the back-
ground. The organ is reminiscent
of “Positively Fourth Street” in
the latter song. This song prob-
ably comes closest of all those on
the album to matching Dylan’s
previous style.

The lyrics of the whimsical
“Peggy Day” and “Country Pie”
_ show a humor not evident in pre-
vious Dylan albums. These songs
are further heightened by a twan-
gy quality that the artist is able
to produce from his guitar.

The lyrics of “I Threw It All
Away,” “Tonight I’ll Be Staying
Here with You,” and “One More
Night” are some of the best on the
album yet lack the traditional Dy-
lan symbolism and deep meaning.
The words of these songs, as with
the entire collection, are subordi-
nate to the music.

This is unusual for Bob Dylan
whose fame has heretofore been a
result ofthe sharpness and im-
pact of his lyrics. His singing and
instrumental abilities have us-
ually been downgraded, even by
his most enthusiastic followers.

In Nashville Skyline there are
no messages. This is the first Dy-
lan album for listening and re-.
laxing. Here Dylan emerges as a

string of 22-plus innings "sans
earned runs.

“Mike got behind on the bat-
ters — 2-0 usually,” Lewis noted.
“Then, he had to come in too
good, and that’s when they hit

, him.’’

The Lions scored two runs in
the first inning, but like so
many times before with Niccols
on the mound, the tallies were
unearned.

All of the mitters’ scores were .

ligitimate, all coming on singles.
Three. base hits placed together
in the second accounted for one
run,‘ while four bingles in the
fifth brought three scores across
the plate. ’

Frank Gustine was the batting
star for the mitters in the night-
cap. He had a four-for-four day
at the plate, scored once, and
drove intwo runs. Gustine, who
also pitched the sixth inning, is
now the batting leader among
his teammates. He’s hitting at a
454 clip.

Gustine doesn’t have to hold that
lead for too long. The mitters
have only two games remain-
ing on their 1969 schedule.
Tomorrow they travel to Kent,
Ohio to meet Dick Paskrt’s Kent
State Golden Flashes and Fri-
day it’s back to Pittsburgh for a
meeting with Duquesne at Her-
schel Field.

Kent State has had a very dif-
ficult spring, especially after
the good campaign they had last

year. Most of their team records,

offensively, were broken last year
and the Flashes had the player
who was to become the New York
Yankees’ first selection in the
baseball draft. Thurmond Munson,
now property of the Yanks, left
the Flashes with a record career
batting average of .390. He hit
.413 last spring.

So far this year the Flashes
have a 4-win, 13-losses, 1 tie mark,
and their leading hitter is Tony
Nappi, a junior infielder who is
swinging .333. The squad has a
team average at the plate of .225,

compared to the mitter’s' .295‘

pace.

On paper, the mitters appear
to be equal on defense with the
Flashes, as both teams have made
more errors than the -coaches
would have wanted to see. Lewis
may be able to look at a few, to-
morrow, without worrying, though.

Coaches Not
  Ready With
, Star Choices

-by ED CONLEY ,
Only four pitching lpots
are open on each of the All-
Star squads to be selected by
the Tri-State Coaches Asso-
ciation for Sunday’s North-
South game at Forbes Field.
Thatmeans a lot of good district
‘pitchers will be disappointed.

Hurlers highlight the list of
nominations for the first attrac-
tion of the new college baseball
coaches group, but many of them

are beingeliminated at this mo-

ment. The coaches had hoped to
announce their A11-Star line-ups
over the weekend, but having fal-
len behind a bit, tomorrowlooks
like the day of rekoning.

Two of the leading candidates
for the mound positions are Bob-
by Lewis’ top Panther hurlers,
George Medich and Mike Nic-
cols. When the nominations were
made Medich had a 1.10 earned-
run average and a 3-1 record. N ic-
cols, a sophomore, carried an
unimpressive 1-1 mark at the time,
but his ERA was 0.00. The right-
hander had pitched 18-1/3 innings
without allowing an earned run.

Joe Filipowski of Clarion
State and Larry Sawyer of Grove
City are also among the final-
ists. Those pitchers possess low
ERA’s, despite the difficulties
they have had against Lewis’
mitters. Filipowski’s ERA is 0.82
and Sawyer’s is 1.24.

Last week the mitters defeat-
ed Clarion, 6-2, hitting Filipow-
ski hard. Filipowski didn’t lose
the game, but he was unable to
stop the mitters’ hot bats. The mit-
ters and Medich edged Sawyer,
2-1, earlier in the season.

Point Park’s Joe O’Grodnik is
another pitcher who has a chance
to make the line—up. The hurler-
shortstop is Panther Ron O’Grod-
nik’s brother, and‘Ron is among
the shortstops still in the run-
ning. A .

Joe McCain and Bob Solonickne
are the only other Panther base-
ballers on . the nominating list.»
Both are outfield candidates, and

McCain is batting .348 with 13.‘

That’

 

by Jerry ‘Cruebel

Sports Editor

When the mitters completed their fielding drills be-

fore Wednesday’s game against Clarion at Leech Farm

Field, Merf the Cerf, the Panther version of that infamous
Floridian wildman and thief walked up to Joe McCain.
Merf asked the hard-hitting centerfielder to stand along
the first base line and catch a couple of tosses. He then ran
towards the fence in left-centerfield determined to prove
that he could throw the baseball 330 feet.

“That kid is crazy,” said sophomore first basemen

V Earle Bellisario from the sidelines. “He’s crazy.”

That kid, Merf the Cerf, is the baseball team’s rookie
manager Dave Canterman, and the long-haired equipment
man could very well be a bit loco.’

During one game, Merf sat himself down on the grass
a few feet from'the end of the bench where coach Bobby
Lewis was sitting. He began to untie his shoe lace. “I think
I have glass in my shoe,” guessed Merf.

Merf took off his shoe,-turned it upside-down, and sure
enough, little particles of glass trcikled out. He looked up
and smiled, “That must be the ‘glass fro_m the whiskey
glass I stepped on in the bar last night.”

‘ But Merf is at his best when "he sits behind the batting
cage and talks up a storm. One of his self-assigned duties
as manager is to rile opposing players, like he did in Tues-
day’s 12-9 victory over Duquesne.

MANAGER DAVE CANTERMAN, alias Merf the Cerf, watches the ac-

tion from his familiar spot behind the batting cage. If Merf were to

i ever quit his post, baseball would not be as much fun for the mitters
' ‘as it is now.

Relief pitcher John Smulski was having his troubles
on the mound in the seventh inning’ when Merf turned to-
wards the Panther bench, pointed to the Duquesne hurler,
and shouted, “He has a shotgun arm, except it isnt loaded.”

Merf paused a moment, either to clear his strained
throat, or to think of something else to say, or both. Then
he yelled, “He throws bee bee’s. He never worked with
baseballs before.” '

In the’Duquesne half of the third inning, with the mit-
ters ahead 4-0, Dukes starting pitcher Paul Hindes sin-
gled. Hindes signalled his bench for a warm-up jacket. “He
don’t get a jacket,” shouted Merf. “He hasn’t been doing
that good, so he gets punished.” ,_ ‘

The Dukes scored that inning, and for the first inning
in the game, Merf’s artistic talents weren’t needed. Usual-
ly, when the opposition fails to cross the plate, Merf the
Cerf draws little faces within the zeros on the scoreboard.
After two innings, according to Merf’s unique way of keep-
ing score, the.mitters led, four runs to two faces.

“You did that well,’’ I said to Merf, as the sunglasses-
clad junior manager approached the bench after drawing a
face on the scoreboard. .

“Class,” beamed Merf. “It may be low, but it’s class.”

But “Zip,” as Merf is often called by the mitters,
does not always refrain his jeers to opposing players. The
game against Duquesne was a particularly poorly umpired
contest, and the players on both benches were riding Carty
Willis, the umpire behind the plate.

“This is the worst game I ever umped,” moaned Willis,
complaining about the onslaught of heckling that had been
directed at him throughout the game.

“That’s funny,” replied Merf, thinking about the num-
erous disputed calls Willis misjudged during the game. “I
was about to say the same thing.”.

“Zip” is always saying or doing something out of the
ordinary, and the mitters wouldn’t be the same happy fam-
ily without him. The opposition isn’t the same with him.

Netters Drop Ninth Consecutive’:

Riggle Offers Pope Needed Help
For Remainirtg Three Matches

by BILL NAAB

A‘squad’s second team is generally composed of players who do not meet the caliber of the
first string. Such is not the case for coach Ben Pope and his tennis team. ’

“There are ten people in school
who could beat our present team,”
Pope said. He remarked that the
score between the two groups
would probably be 5-1, or 4-2 in
singles matches. ‘Mike Riggle
John King, J. D. Lewis, and Bob
Dumler are the most important
members of this non-playing sec-
ond team.

Without the help of this capa-
ble ‘second team,’ the netters
are gasping for some sort of hope.
Saturday, they lost their ‘ninth
match without a victory to Grove
City. “We’re struggling. We don’t

GOLF
The Golf team (3-6) hosts Car-

negie ‘- Mellon this afternoon _ '
at Shannopin Country Club. ,

The contest starts at 1:30 p.m.

The golfers earned their third

_ victory of the season against

Duquesne Friday Afternoon,

also on their home course. Num-

ber one man John Meteney fired

a two-under-par 69 to lead the
linksmen to an easy 6-1 win.

Mike McGuire (5-4), Chick
Patrick (6-4), Joe Volansky (3-2‘)
Richard Antinuzzi (3-2), Sam
Zinger (5-4), and Henry Hig-
genbottom (5-4) also won their
matches for the golf team.

SUMMER SOFTBALL LEAGUE

The rain has not been as
hard on this year’s'Summer Soft-
ball League schedule as it was
on last year’s intramural slate,
and after the first week of
play in the undergraduate
league three teams share first
place.

On top in the International
League are Born Losers, Sigma
Chi, and Delta Sigma Phi, all
boasting 1-0 records.

AE Pi (1-1) is in second
place, followed by Phi Kappa
Theta (0-1) and Kappa Kappa
Psi lost its only game to AE
Pi when they watched three runs
cross the plate in the sixth in-
ning.

Today, at 6:00 p.m., Kap-
pa Kappa Psi will try again
for their initial victory in the
league when (they oppose Sig-
ma Chi. Sigma Chi dumped
Phi Kappa ‘Theta, 10-9, in
their opening game.

Tomorrow Sigma Chi battles
undefeated Delta Sigma Phi,
and the Phi Kaps aim for their
first win against Alpha Ep-
silon Pi.

The entire schedule can be
obtained at the Intramural office
in Trees Hall.

have all the players available who
could play,” said Pope. .“There’s
something that doesn’t inspire
them (the second team’). What
are you going to do if they re-
fuse to play? They have to have
desire, motivation, and pride for
the school.”

One ray of hope, however, oc-
cured within the past week. Mike
Riggle has decided to participate
in the three remaining home
matches of the season. Pope has
so much faith in Riggle’s ability
that he stated that his number one
man, Tom Stomp, wouldn’t have
much of a chance against the
talented refugee of the pow-
erful ‘second team.’

This past Saturday, however,
even the ‘second team’ would
have had their hands full. Grove
City dumped. the netters, 8-0 .
A singles and a doubles match
was forfeited to the Grovers.
Number six man John Ewing did
now show up. Ewing, possibly

will join the ranks of the non-
playing second team.

“I have no idea why he didn’t
come, and I’ve had no call. He
might not play anymore this
season. He shouldn’ be car-
ried on the squad if he breaks a
rule like that,” remarked Pope.

Meanwhile, the men who did"
show up were treated harshly.
Tom Stromp was knocked off 6-4
and 6-2 in singles.
