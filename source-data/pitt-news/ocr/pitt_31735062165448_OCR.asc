Charity Discussed
At Friday Service

Friday night services at Heinz
Chapel, commemoratirrg the 175th
anniversary of both the Univer-
sity and the United States Con-
stitution, were conducted by Rab-
bi Jacob of the Rodef Shalom
Temple. Rabbi Rubinstein, who
usually» leads the service, was
kept away by the death of his
father-in-law.

Rabbi Jacob spoke on the ne-
cessity for recognizing the part
others play in any success a per-
son may have. He proposed that
a ﬁrm religious foundation must
be based on a habit of kindness
and charity towards one’s fellow
man.

One point in Rabbi Jaeob’s
sermon was that one should be-
gin to practice the habit of kind-
ness now, rather than “tomor-
row.” He remarked that the
“tomorrow” so many people speak

of never arrives.

Rabbi Jacob was assisted by the

elude the Bronze Star medal, the

Belgium Fourragere and three
battle stars for service in Europe,
and the Commendation Ribbon
tor service in Korea. He has been
awarded occupation medals for
Germany and Japan, and ser-
vice medals for the American,
European and Paciﬁc theatres.
Colonel Banks, who recently re-
ceived his M.A. from the Univer-
sity, served under General Pat-V
ton during World War I in Eng-
land, France, Germany, and Aus-
tria. He also served in Okinawa

Intermission, Band in I A
0"" Delight Dance Crowd

Huntsmen Dedicate ‘Kitten’ Song to Dr. Rankin;
Minuet Interlude Found ‘Brief But Interesting’
By JOE GREIF

Saturday night brought students, alumni, faculty, ad-
ministration, and guests to the Student Union for the Con-

stitution Ball.

Woody Herman’s orchestra played brassy but polished
sounds which were well received by the dancers.

Herman presented an excellently chosen repertoire, with.

plenty to please every taste. The¢

band received large rounds of ap-

V plause forinumbers such as “Tea

A

for Two Cha Cha.”,It more than
fulfilled its reputation as one of
the outstanding groups in the
country.
Midway Entertainment
At.'about the midway point of

33.3,‘ the dance, there was_ a lengthy

Vx.‘

intermission . during which ‘]two
student‘ groups entertained the
guests. The ﬁrst of these was a
group of singing boys called The
Huntsmen. Already familiar to
many students from their per-
formances at recent functions,
The Huntsmen made new friends
among" the older guests. By in-
jecting some laughs. into their act,
the ‘boys retained audience atten-
tion. ' '
One of the numbers in their
act was “Purring Kitten,” which
they dedicated to Dr. Rankin.
Called back for an encore, the
boys broke up the audience
with their version ‘of “Zombie
Jamboree.” Though not all of
The Huntsmen have particu-
larly ﬁne singing voices, -they
are living nroof of how much
can be accomplished with a lit-
tle showmanship and innnova-
tion; '

The second group to perform
during" this intermision was a cos-
tumed octet doing an 18th century
minuet. They were dressed in _the
style of George Washington’s day,
Whit.‘ wigs and all. Music for the

‘played by Colin Sterne with an

        

assist from a couple of Mr, Her-
man’s men. It was a brief but
interesting, interlude. '

Monday’s Alumni Honors Convocation erupted as an
. "unfortunate blemish on‘ the face of an otherwise‘ perfect
i _ University Anniversary celebration.
The highly-touted affair proved. tophave little or no
 meaning to, the general student body, who is constantly
being repremanded for not supporting Honors Convoca-

I -One glance at the structure of Monday’s performance
wouldeasily reveal why‘ students have not attended these
A events very strongly in the past and, indeed, why so many
students felt compelled tolvacate Syria Mosque before the
program had been completed.
The only color in the entire program was exhibited in‘
~ the pagentry of the processional, an event which no stu-
i_ dent should miss. However, Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein’s
_ seemingly endless invocation set the tone for the remainder
of the ceremonies.
Simply too many alumni, though “honored and revered
' __ in -their fields,” were brought to the fore on Monday. The
recipients unequivocally deserved recognition; it is doubt-
ful, however, that they deserved being subjected to their
lengthy introductions, verbal biographies and cliche-rid-
den hosannas.

Beginning with his review of themonumental changes
at the University during the past five years, Litchﬁeld dis-
.appointingly produced statistics concerning the students,
faculty and building programs which had beenmade public
for some time. »

The Chancellor also commented that the rennovation
ofithe University had met with “overwhelming endorse-
ment” and “enthusiastic support” of the community. Such
remarks are questionable in light of the highly critical atti-
tude of the city’s papers, and their readers’ letters which
consistently declaim the school's tuition and real estate ac-
quisitions —- two subjects which Litchﬁeld failed to touch
upon. q

The proposal that the school prepare to enter the space
‘age through its research and other use of its facilities is a
highly admirable one, but suddenly it became buried, un-
developed, in the middle of several other suggestions, none
of which equalled the former.

Direction and importance appeared to be lacking in the
Chancellor's address, as they were in the earlier parts of
the program. It is felt that they must be returned to Honors
Convocation if students are expected to attend and remain
at them.

School Spirit‘ .‘ : is I

Freshman Ent

   

husiasm  

By, Jackie Katz

 
   
 

Much has been said in the past couple of years
about the lack of school spirit and the amount of
apathy shown for the University. Yet in spite of
this, the pep rally held last week
and the game on Saturday were
very well represented by stu-
dents. The cheering at both of
these events was also louder
than it had previously been./.,

Is itpossible that some school
spirit is ﬁnally working its way
out? Is it because these events
were televised? Or is itthat the
freshmen are enthusiastic about
attending a big university and
allthe spirit we have been wit-
nessing is coming fromthem? It is possible that
allthree of these facts are true. '

Last-year the ﬁrst pep rally was deemed suc-

 

cessful, but many remarked that the_majority of a

people in attendance were freshmen. Last week
there were remarks such as “Gee, there are an
awful lot of people at this rally. I’ll bet most of
them are freshmen.” -

Is it wrong that the majority of people with
school spirit are freshmen? Not if their spirit con-
tinues and does notdwindle. Last year’s freshmen
class was very enthusiastic at the beginning of the
term. Yet, when Student Government called _ a
freshman» meeting so that ‘the ,class- could meet
their senators only 25 freshmen showed up.

Aid ‘Enthusiasm

Let’s not "let the enthusiasm that this year’s
class has dwindle. Instead it should be aided in its
growth. A ﬁne start has already been made this
summer and at the beginning of this term‘ with
the Freshmen Camp, Freshmen Outing, and the
riverboat cruises.

With the co-operation ‘oi the various school clubs‘

I and organizations we can keep the freshmen inter‘-

ested and full of school spirit. If this can: be done
each year, we will soon have a student body that
is very" mindful of school spirit.

We must not forget that school spirit‘ does not

just mean cheering at a football game or attend-
ing a pep rally. Instead, it means participating in
all school events, and supporting all school func-
tions. The clubs and organizations can help in
keeping the freshmen enthusiastic by -having open
houses, inviting them to meetings, and trying, in
general, to encouragethem to ‘join now the activi-
ties in which they have an interest.

Granted, many of the different organizations
had a member speak to the freshmen during the
Freshmen Camp and Outing about their organiza-
tion. But hearing and seeing are entirely two"
different things. I
Pitt Players Party Praised

One group, ‘the Pitt Players, has already held an
openhouse. This party was very successful’ and it
-gavelthe Playersa wonderful opportunity to sell
themselves to the freshmen _and anyone else who
was interested in that particular group.

, Last yearno group was given the privilege of/»_
, in

having _a member speak at the Freshman Outingzi  3
and very few organizations had an open house or f “'. ,

meeting, for the class. Consequently, most of the
freshmen soon lost all of their interest and spirit

V for belonging. -
' These parties and .meetings- need not be just ’

for ‘the freshmen- It would be advantageous also to
invite the’ upperclassmen. In thisway we might
attempt tobring back the/ enthusiasm that they
had when they were freshmen’.

A ' There are still a lot of upperclassmen that have

school spirit, granted. But these people -seem to ,

be in the minority.’ Last year’ a pep club was
formed. The members made posters "announcing
the pep rallies- They encouraged their .friends to
come, and actually did everything they ‘possibly
could to get’ the student body to come to a pep
rally. Y_et,vas the season progressed, attendance at
the‘ rallies progressively dwindled.

Those upperclassmen who still have spirit

‘should ‘do; their best to- instill that spirit in their
. fellow studentsf"In this way not only will we have .
enthusiastic. freshmen, but an entire school of’:-

enthusiastic students.

’ A Touc|1y‘eProb|eem . . .

~As a .result of numerous conversations with
physicians, aifew magazine articles", and personal
debate I formed some very deﬁnite ‘opinions on a
subject which is very seldm discussed openly.
Only with the bold faced type of ‘
“thalidomide” did the opportune A
moment arise for my motivations
to take a tangible form and en-
able me to suggest some possible
solutions to a rather touchy sub-
ject. Criminal Abortion. , ‘
Abortion! To the straight-
laced, uninformed person it is a
‘naughty word. To the medical ;
doctor it is merely another term '
in his professional vcabulary. To
the general public it is ‘a topic 1
which is discreetly avoided. A" My concern is not
with the ethical aspects of -abortion itself, but in‘-

 

stead with the unlawful existence ‘of ‘criminal

abortion, a "problem for society. ,

‘According to STEDMAN’S ‘SHORTER <MEDI-
CAL DICTIONARY, criminal abortion is deﬁned as
that which is undertaken solely for the purpose of
getting rid of the as product of conception, and not
necessitated _by the state of the mother’s health.
This would not include the therapeutic_ abortions
performed by medical doctors within the bounds of
the state laws.. Criminal abortion involves the do-
it-yourself pseudo-doctors who make a living by
performing their ‘fduty.” This group includes
largely persons with just a smattering‘ of medical
knowledge, medical students who ﬂunked, out, den-
tists pressed for cash, druggists tempted by the
easy monetary gains, and even such persons as
mechanics with access to an outdated anatomy text.
Millions Aborted Illegally

In the United States, it is estimated that there
are as many as three million criminal abortions
performed annually. More startling is the fact
that ﬁve thousand women are killed at the hands
of these incompetents. “These numbers mean very
little to the average person. But to someone at-
tached to the girl that is. infected, sterilized, or
killed by a person ignorant of medicine, these num-
bers become vividly meaningful.

Loss of fertility due to a clothes_ hanger wound
is no nice thing to talk about, "but many times it
takes such an event to arouse public interest in
the cause of'.hum‘anity.- For a racket" which._is. on

The ‘existence of this situation presents a prob-

Attack New Grading System
Huhbies Confused Over Recent Change to IBM ‘
.»< r Machine , Method of Letter Grade Evaluation

By VIJAY JAIN

“The recent change over from
the percentage grading system to
the letter grading system has got
our husbands confused and we
don’t think that some of the in-
structors understand, it either,”
complained two members of the
Student Auxiliary toithe Ameri-
can Dental Association, Mrs. Syl-

grvia Follet and Mrs. Gayle Sweet.

According to ‘the wives of the
dental students, the University
changed the grading system in

mid-stream for their husbands be-0

cause “they felt that the IBM ma-

chines will be able'to handle the
' letter grades better than the per-

centage grades.” -

“Not even the top student in the
dental ‘school was invited to the

honors convocation last year, due
to the change in the grading sys-
tem.” Mrs. Sweet stated.
Obtainedelnformation _

I called the office of dean of
dental school to obtain c_omment,
but was informed that the infor-
mation about the two grading
systems and to get. their com-
ment, but was informed that the
information could not be given to
me.

The ‘lady atthe Dean’s oﬂice

 told me, “Why can’t the stu-

‘dents come to us directly, any
way their wives have nothing to
do in the matter . . . if the stu-
dents do not understand the
new grading system it is too
bad.” _

Mrs. Follet, however’, informed

me that their husbands did make ,

an effort’ to ﬁnd out about the
grading system but their instruc-

’tors were unable to explain it to‘
’ them, they seemed as confused as

anyone else.
' Student Explains

' ’ A /dental student, who wished

to remain anonymous, explained
that previously 75 per cent was
minimum passing and one knew
just where the student stood by
the marks he got, now “C” is pass-
ing. Most test papers are not re-
turned and if they are, they just

. bear the letter grade, thus one

x

::"--'\=}_.f\_is uncertain if one is barely pass-

..I

ing or missing a “B” by a point.
Any student obtaining below
a “C” grade has to take a re-
test, repeat the year or is dis-
missed depending on his pre-
vious record, so it is very im-
portant to know exactly where
onestands; the student conclud-
ed.
Gayle and Sylvia suggested that
both the letter grades, and the
percent marks obtained should be
told; they should have continued
“the old grading -system for the
upperclassmen; and. the students
should be explained“ the one grad-

,‘ ing. system as compared to the

otlmr, i.e. 7,5 to 83 ‘is a» “C."

That. the University has no
housing .project for the married
students, and there are no im-
midiate plans for such an endeav-
or also bothered Gayle and
Sylvia. “Even 'a small liberal arts
college like W. & J. with only 900
students has a .‘splinter village’
for the married students.

“During the 175 years of the
University’s ‘glorious’ past sure-
ly the need must have arisen to
house the married students.”

Gayle" complained that there
were no quarters within a reason-
able budget for the married stu-
dents. f‘A,fter the exhorbitant tui-
tion, which they further raise
nearly every year, we cannot af-
ford to pay the rent asked of us.”

Lack of Facilities

Moving to another problem,
they talked about the lack of ade-
quate facilities for parking at the
University. “Our hubbies have to
rise with the sun to get a park-
ing place, and we have to rise
with them to send them off.” The
better-‘halves complained.

T h e administration should
have taken this matter into con-
sideration when planning the
new complex of Health Profes-
.sions Buildings.

“Our ‘husbands have to wear
white shirts to the school every

day, and we the girls have- to do

all the laundry. We can’t afford
to send them to the laundry. We 0

think that white shirts should not
be mandatory, but optional.” Syl-
via spoke for all in her group. '
Age Range

The dental students range in
age from early 20s to late 40s, and
come from Florida in the South,
to California in the west; conﬁd-

ed Sylvia, “our membership is 89.

excluding the incoming fresh-
man’s wives. Our once a month
meetings are held on the second
Wednesday at the Uni_versity’s
Nurses’ residence, which about 60
members attend.”-

The auxiliary was establish-
ed in 1959, “to bring together
women of a similar interests to
develop a friendly and social
group . . .”

Gayle informed that each year
a project is planned. For the
past two years a “Smile Con-
test” for children between the
ages of six and ten has been
arranged, “these contests have
proved to be quite successful
and we have received over
2,000 entries.” .

Most of the auxiliary members
either go to school themselves, or
work to support the family, in ad-
dition to doing the household
chores.

African Educational Problems

Six Members of University Faculty Participate
In Annual Summer Conference Series at Hague

Six University faculty mem-

bers traveled to the Hague this
August to participate in an in-
ternational’ seminar which ex-
plored the problem of African
education. _ '
\ The second international sem-
inar, sponsored by the Nether-
lands Universities Foundation For
International Cooperation. the
University of Pittsburgh, and the
Regional Council for Interna-
tional Education (Pittsburgh), was
held at NUFFIC headquarters in
the Hague.

The discussion, “American and
Dutch Educational Values and
Emerging Africa”, was a continua-
tion of last year’s seminar which
explored to what extent education
was, shaped by and in its turn
moulded the cultural environment.
Subjects dealt with in the dis-
cussions included education in an

‘industralizing society, the value

of early or late‘ specialization,
mass education vs. education for

‘ an intellectual elite, the tradition

of non-school education, and ed-
ucation in non-Western countries.
Committees Reported

At the concluding session, com-
mittes presented their reports on
those educational values in the
two systems which the partici-
pants considered to ~be appli-
cable to emerging Afrcan edu-
cation.

The ﬁnal seminar of the ser-

les is to be held'a.‘. NUFFIC

to discuss the place of the so- A

cial sciences and humanities in

Class Begins ' to Show

Cub Gridders Already Eyeing
Opener Against West Virginia

A By STU BERNSTEIN

A highly enthusiastic group of 30 freshman gridders con-
tinue to knock pads this week in preparation for their Sept.
29 opener against West Virginia. ‘ "

The Cubs face their traditionally small, but_ rpugh,
schedule this. season. After their game .with the Moun-

taineers, the fresh will travel to¢

"the Naval Academy and Penn
State.‘ The only home contest of
the campaign will be with Kent
State on Oct. 19.

Coach" Kaliden has not as‘ yet
touched on a starting team for'the
Cubs upcoming scrimmages. “I in-
tend to play my A and_ B squads
about the same amount,”'he said,
“torgive all the .boys experience.”

Blocking Solid

Right now the depth of the
team seems concentrated at the
tackle slot. vKaliden has four
equally aggressive blockers in Jim
Jones, George Macko, Tom Ray-
monand Bob Milkovitz.

Joe Novogratz, brother of
Army great Bob Novogratz, is
providing strength at guard, an-
other deep part of the bigger
than usual freshman line._

The backﬁeld also shows great
talent. A pair of Kens, Lucas and
Perry, will be’ doing the signal
calling. The Cubs have a good
deal of break—away running abil-
ity .in halfbacks Eric Crabtree,
Dale Stewart and Jim Dodaro. _

The most impressive aspect ‘a of
the team, however, is their desire.
“_This team shows a great deal of
downright enthusiasm,” said the
Cub mentor.

More Work

The coach hopes to get more
use out of the Head Hunters who
had a somewhat spoiled debut.
“I’d certainly like to use them
more, but I'll have to see how
they work out,” he said.

The Head Hunters started the
second half, as the Panthers
kicked off, and Miami proceeded

. to march downfield for a. score.
the regular team came in once
the Hurricanes were inSid¢ the
Panther 20.

The Head Hunters looked like
an outstanding success when they
ﬁrst entered the game. On the
first play the defensive unit was
in, George Mira threw his only
long pass ‘of the day and safety-
man Fran Novak intercepted it.

From then on, for the Head
Hunters and the rest of the squad,
it was all downhill.

The intramural program will pull an interesting switch

boys will play it,” he said. °

‘Bemis called the alumni squad,
“probably the best defensive team

* Walt J eﬂords, a highly-touted
sophomore, played a sound defen-

according to Bemis. Dave Reich-

long, powerful kicks, and Paul

Bemis also singled out Andy

their stellar play in the game.-
