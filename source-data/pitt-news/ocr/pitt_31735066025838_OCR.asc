Showcase Editor

Attempting to "overcome jeers all
evening from angry students, former Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates
described the May riots ir1 LA. as being
run “by hoodlums” and that the “good
people stayed at home.”

His attack drew a hostile response from
Black Action Society members and others
who protested the event. Raising fists and
turning their chairs away from Gates,
some of the audience chanted “bullshit”
to several of Gates’ responses.

Midway through a ‘question-and—answer
session, African Americans swept out of
the Assembly Room chanting “No justice,
no peace.”

The debate between Gates and Nadine
Strossen, who is the president of the
American Civil Liberties Union, was
intended to focus on whether law and
order is working in our society. But the
focus often turned into Gates’ involve-
ment in the beating of motorist Rodney
King and the riots that occurred after the
police officers surrounding the beating
were acquitted.

Gates drew loud hissing sounds as he
defended the LA. Police Department say-
ing “there was nothing wrong with the
initial blows delivered to King.” He

stressed that the officers were repeatedly

unable to take King into custody pointing

to the fact that he was able to throw four

police officers off of him initially. _
Strossen criticized not only the LAPD

for the incident, but also the jurors who

Assembly Room last night.

Former Los Angeles Police Chief Gates
and President of the American Civil Liberties
Union Nadine Strossen debated on whether
law and order works in America.

Gates said that he was not bothered by
the protesters who had stationed them-
selves in front of the union. “Everyone has
the right to demonstrate,” he said.

Gates said that he was concerned that
some people misunderstood the roll he
played as ‘police chief at the time of the
Rodney King beating. He said that some
people seemed to believe that he actually
took part in the beating when he was not
even there. '

“[Thel Rodney King [situation] doesn’t
deserve the attention that it gets, it really
doesn’t,” he said.

Gates said the main reason he travels to
colleges and universities is because crime is
a serious issue to young people and that
hopefully they would find some hope for
the situation after the debate.

“I would just like to sit down with four or
five members of the group that was protest-
ing and just talk with them and discuss the
issues,” Gates said. “Until you take the time
to know one another, you can’t get beyond
the issues that are plaguing this country.

Gates was also concerned that the pro-
testers were passing judgement on a person

Undergrads to boost
Project Jump Start

By Christine Hanna
News Editor '

The Student Government Board is looking for four CAS
undergrads to fill positions and represent student con-
cerns on advisory committees for Governor Robert
Casey’s Project Jump Start.

Students can apply to be on committees for the future
multi—purpose academic complex, convocation center,
expansion of Hillman Library and the Bellefield Annex.

Director of Space Management William Flurry said that
it is important that there are students on these committees
because “the chancellor has assured a more open and
democratic way of making decisions,” and students can
“formulate the policies for occupancy of the buildings.”

“[The student committee membersl‘ will be able to
address student concerns,” SGB President Gil Golden
said.‘ '

Golden said students will be able to help decide if
there needs to be more study space in the library or a
larger computer lab. They will also be able to add their
original ideas.

Golden also said that this is a time when students can
come up with ideas that the administration never would
dream of. A

Flurry said that it is hard to say whenthe first. shovel
will hit the ground and the construction will begin. “What
we have to do is make plans,” he said. -

Any interested students can apply at Friday’s SGB meet-
ing at 3 p.m. in 639 William Pitt Union.

Students who are interested and cannot attend the
meeting can stop by the sixth ﬂoor office before Friday.

Nearly 200 African—American
students marched in the rain
from the Towers to the William
Pitt Union last night singing, “The
people united will never‘ be
defeated,” as part of a protest
against police brutality.

A student, who did not want to
be identified, spoke through a
megaphone to the protesters out-
side of the Union.

“This is not just about Gates.
This- is a protest for all the broth-
ers that are shot everyday like
dogs in the street,” she said.

The demonstration, organized
by the Black Action Society,
began at 7:20 p.m. under the
shelter of the crosswalk extend-
ing over Forbes Avenue, about
an hour before the debate enti-
tled “Law and Order in America:
Is the System Working?” between
American Civil Liberties Union
President Nadine Strossen and
the former Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl Gates.

As students stood in line to
purchase tickets for the debate,
the protesters entered the
Assembly Room in a solid line
that coiled from the Assembly
Room to the Fifth Avenue
entrance of the union.

te

with mock tickets made to sym-
bolize the need for reparation.

“We are going to use these
tickets as reparation for what has
happened,” a student said to the
group before entering the debate.
He referred to PPC’s disregard
toward African-American stu-
dents.

The student added that it is not

enough to have black students
join the PPC. -
“We don’t have time to be on
the Pitt Program Council. We
have to fight other struggles.”

The media was also the object

 
   

of criticism. .

Another speaker at the rally
told the members of the group
not to make any comments or
give their names to any reporter,
specifically The Pitt News
reporter.

“Say your name, is Rodney
King or X,” she said.

She added, "‘You do not to
speak to any of the media
because they never represent
you correctly.”

Pitt as/eed to fund telescope in Arizona

By Leon Fuksman
and David Weimer
The Pitt News

Pitt’s physics and astronomy department
is pressuringthe university to invest in the
Arizona telescope project. Local environ-
mentalist claim the project will disinherit
the San Carlos Apache Tribe from sacred
land and endanger the existence of the
Mount Graham red squirrel.

The University of Arizona invited Pitt to .

take part in a plan to expand two observa-
tories already erected on Mount Graham.
Pitt’s Student Environ- mental Action
Coalition aspires to prevent the construc-
tion of the Columbus Telescope project by

. organizing a signature drive today from 11

a.m. to 1 p.m. in front of the Cathedral of
Learning.

“We’re trying to get people interested.
Once we have their attention we can put
together real solutions, not just sit around
and talk about it,” said Matt Peters, head
of Native Issues of SEAC.

The Allegheny Observatory and the
physics and astronomy departments were
offered a one-tenth share in the project.

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor will have

the final say in the university’s involve-
ment, Dr. Dave Turnshek, professor of
physics and astronomy, 

“The chancellor is considering a number
of proposals, and no decision has been
made,” university spokesperson Tim
Ziaukas said. - _

T urnshek proposed other possible tele-
scope sites to O’Connor, including two in
Chile. He said Mt. Graham is the most cost
efficient site and would become the largest

observatory in the world.

Through computer networking‘,
Pittsburgh astronomers would study early
universe evolution unhindered by an
excessively lit metropolitan area and the
limited capability of the local Allegheny
observatory.

 is one of the most important areas
of research,” Cyril Hazard, professor of
physics and astronomy, said. “It would
earn Pittsburgh some prominence.”

The proposed telescope site has stirred
up a controversy among Apache Indians
who consider the mountain ' sacred.
According to a chronology published by
the Apache Survival Coalition in 1983, the
passing of the Arizona Wilderness Bill with-

.drew Mt. Graham from V/"ildemess desig-

nation. This paved the way for a 1984 bull-
dozing of a Native American religious site.

“Any religious person knows that it is a
sin to be disrespectful of another’s religion.
For us, religion and culture are not so sep-
arate. On this mountain is a great life-giv-
ing force. You have no knowledge of the
place you are about to destroy,” said
Franklin Stanley Sr., San Carlos Apache
Medicine Man and spiritual leader.

Turnshek said the observatory would
benefit the Apaches by boosting the local
economy.

“This observatory would provide good
jobs for a lot of the Apaches,” he said.
“Other telescope projects in the past have
spurred a lot of jobs for the Indians.”

Hazard said that the feelings of local
Apaches regarding the sacred site do not
represent the convictions of all Apaches.

The other debatable issues are the ecolo-
gy of the mountain and the red squirrel
which lives on the boreal summit of Mt.
Graham. ,

“Mt. Graham possesses more life zones

« than any other isolated U.S. mountain.

More than 18 unique plants and animals
have evolved at this ‘inland Galapagos’

A loud rumble -resonates
through Pitt Stadium as a cloud of
steam drifts from the south tun-
nel. i -

Thirty ‘screaming lunatics ham-
mer away on golden drums
overzealously leading the charge
from the “hole.”

It’s Saturday, gameday at Pitt
Stadium. And the University of

‘Pittsburgh Marching Band high-

steps from the tunnel onto the

~ turf for its pregame show. _
The bright sound and polished

drill that unfolds on Saturdays
does not just happen by sheer
magic. It is the result of unbeliev-

able sacriﬁce, dedication and hard

work.

“People in the university and in
the standsthink that the band just
appears on the field,” said Dr.

O’Neill Sanford, director of bands. ’

“They have no idea how much
hard worrrand how much time
the band.,puts. in..’T.. _ 
Sanford, assisted by associate
director ofibands, David Moy,

and Assistant Directors Jack.

Anderson and Mel Orange,
stressed the overall importance of
the band as far as representing
the Pitt community. I

“The band is the largest public
relations tool of the University of
Pittsburgh,” Sanford said.

The marching band is in its 81st

. year at Pitt. Anderson, a band

member during the 19605, said it
has undergone significant

changes. In the 1930s and 19405

the band fell in line as more _or
less part of the ROTC program
here and catered to this military
aspect until after World War II.
The band in its present form
began in the ‘60s but remained
an all—male organization until
1971. Before the Golden Girls

   
 

   
  
  

 

a’  se

started in 1974, Pitt did not have
any majorettes or a drum major.

"The Golden Girls’ are just one of
many traditions that have become ,

part of the Pitt band experience.
The “Panther head” formation
that composes a portion of the
pregame drill has been around
since the 1950s, while the script
Pitt formation the band forms
during its pregame drill evolved
from a block Pitt used during the
Johrmy Majors era of Pitt football

in the mid—’70s. According to
Anderson, the Majors and Jackie-
Sherrill eras of Panther football ,

were resurgent times for the band
here. After a brief periodof
decline, membership rose again‘

and currently stands at about 200. .

During football season, the
workload for these students
becomes overbearing. The season
begins at a week-long band camp
in. mid-August, where" basic play-
ing and marching skills are taught
and refined and a great deal of

- continuity and .camaraderie are
built. ‘

After camp, the band putsin as

.many as four nights of practice
during the week, and often sacri-

ﬁces its entire Saturday on Pitts
home-game days, beginning with
practices at 8 a.m. ' '

But I the band experience
encompasses much more than
just football games‘, basketball
games and pep rallies. In addi-
tion, the band participates in
parades, high school festivals‘ 
occasionally, gubernatorial ir1au-
gurations. The band will perform
at the Steelers—Seattle Seahawks
game on Dec. 6 and has per-
formed at Buffalo Bills home
games in the past. .

my main goals was to have a

total band program — ‘all facets:

she said “bought into the myth of
a big black man. The jurors
believed he was in control.”

Both Gates and Strossen
agreed, with dilferent reasoning,

 

t that the criminal justice system,

from the streets to the courts to
the police departments, is not
working. Gates blamed everyone
from the media to the American
Civil Liberties Union in his rea-
sons.

Strossen, the first female ever
to be elected president of the
ACLU, offered various reasons for
the systems failure. These reasons
ranged from racism and discrimi-
nation within the criminal justice
system to an unwritten code of
honor among police forces that
treats minorities, particularly
African-American males, unfairly.

, The often—ﬁerce debate packed

the Assembly Room to standing _

capacity as the two jockeyed
back and forth arguing law and
order. In his attack, Gates blamed
the ACLU for initiating restrictions
on police departments that made
them “unworkable”_ and argued
that the media had made gang

membership “en vogue” by men-
tioning gang members and gang
names.

“If you want to see your name
up in lights, all you have to do is

— join a gang,” and essentially

watch the 11 o’dock news, Gates
said. »

Strossen lashed out at discrimi-
nation within the criminal justice
system dubbing it “pervaded by
racism.” She said the system treat-
ed white victims as “more seri-
ous” and-cited the fact that not
one member of the LAPD “stood
up and reported this miscon-
duct,” referring to the King beat-
ing as well as a code of honor
that existed within the depart-
ment.

She urged students to turn

anger and-fury into constructive V

action and said that the ACLU
was working to install civilian

review boards in each city. She

also stressed the need for “under-
standing and respect towards dif-
ferent cultures and from police
officers towards the communi-
ties.”  

Gates, said he has met with

“some small demonstrations” dur- "

 

ing speeches and debates he has
given recently.’He drew furious
reaction from students while ask-
ing the crowd to boo and “let it
out” as he took the podium.
Many students felt he was patron-
izing them, and one student
screamed “we ain’t no animals”
after his remark.

Gates attempted to defend his

A 43 years in public oﬁice, includ-

ing 14 as LAPD chief, on various
grounds. He cited his record of
hiring more minorities into the
police department than any other
chief and repeatedly stressed the
fact that “within 36 hours the

- LAPD had _responded to the

nation’s biggest riot.”

‘ Strossen saw the riots different-
ly. She countered them with
numbers and estimates and cited
the 54 deaths and billions of dol-
lars in damage that had been
done. '

Both sides argued about the
size of police forces. "Gates said
that bigger and bigger police
forces are what is wanted,
“because you know that [the
police] stands between you and
crime, but it doesn’t punish the

THE"PI'l’I‘- NEWS, Thursday,‘ November 12,1992? -

criminals.” —

He also warned that you can-
not “thrash the police department
and have them respond the way
you want them to.” He also criti-
cized the ACLU saying “they are
nothing as far as I’m concerned”

Strossen who advocates more
police protection urged that “we
have failed to hold supervisors
accountable.” She said that cor-
ruption 'and racism start from “top
to finish” of police departments
and likened this system to a “poi-

son that spreads throughout the '

system” and is not condoned.

She said that people should not
jump to the conclusion “that all
police should be criticized” but
compared some departments’

“swat-team tactics” to “militaristic.

PDs whose attack on cn'rne and
drugs turned into an attack on
citizens.”

Gates, who tried to shield char-

_acter attacks from the audience

that portrayed him as a bigot and
racist, asked the audience to have
the courtesy to hear him out,
adding “you listen and decide
whether you like someone or
not.”

“There’s no way to get to

Pitt student Marc Fragglia

ple.”

Former Pittsburgh Steeler

debate, said that it was a
good idea.

“I really enjoyed it,” he
said. “It really brought to
mind how the political and
power systems of this

, country should have more

community meetings like
this. We need a lot more of
these sort of things,” he
said." .

Sandra Jordan, a profes-
sor in Pitt’s School of Law
and moderator of the
debate, said that the debate
went well. ,

“I feel comfortable with
the fact that we got a lot of
questions of the students
answered,” she said. “I feel
the protest could have
been more productive. The
issues were addressed, but
many more issues needed
to be addressed.”

the protest was more of a

and cheered.

Before going over to the
union, the speaker made sure

that only the truly dedicated stu-

dents participated. .
“We need committed people.
We don’t need people out here
who are just going to come and
see what happens,” she said.
Another unidentified person
stressed the importance that the

protest against violence did not _

lead to more violence. —

“We are not making this into a
violent rally, but you know how
the police are,” she said.

The speaker continued and
told the group to form a line with
females on the inside and males
on the -outside when someone

- yelled the command “position.”

The group was further instructed
to lock arms in case “they” (the
police) tried any violence.

As a second precaution, the I

speaker told the group that if it
heard the command “disperse” it
was to meet back at the Towers.
“That means something is deﬁ-
nitely not right.”

Outside the Towers, third-year
student Andrew George held a
sign which read “Justice give it
up and turn it loose.” When
asked why he joined in the
protest, he pointed to his sign.

“We are very worried about
the environmental problems, and
if there were any serious envi-
ronmental problems, we would
not go there,” Hazard said.

Turnshek added that the
secured observatory area would
protect the squirrel by making it
less accessible to the public.

“I see this as a large excuse,”
Hayes said.

Peters said today’s signature
drive is SEAC’s second effort to

. show O’Connor that Pitt students

are opposed to the telescope

_ project.

“If we can get Pitt to withdraw,
we’re preventing something that
might happen, not protesting
something that already hap-
pened,” Peters said.

Turnshek said he opposes
most of the concerns raised by
SEAC. He said the public rela-
tions office at the University of
Arizona mishandled the inforrna—
tion distributed to the public.

“Hundreds and hundreds of
articles have been written on this
issue, and they are not dealing
with the facts,” Turnshek said.
“There is always going to be a
faction that decides what the
answer is even before examining
the facts.”

symphonic band,” Sanford said.

Over the last five years,
Sanford has developed a solid
symphonic band program,
something Pitt lacked prior to
his arrival in 1985.

“The key thing for our devel-
opment as far as the sound of
the band, is we have been
recruiting better musicians,” he
said.

The symphonic band keeps a
talented core of musicians play-
ing together the entire academic
year, and their abilities rub off
to other players.

“Symphonic band has greatly
enhanced the sound of march-
ing band,” Sanford said.

Pitt’s drurnline, an animated

bunch that dubs itself “the
crew,” has built a proud tradi-
tion and earned a reputation for
excellence. Many of the drum-
mers said that outdoing other
drumlines, namely West
Virginia’s, is a top priority.

“We’re more competitive,”
said Larry Wilson, who is
known by his crewmates as
“Dawg.” “It’s one of the things
we strive for  to have them
come here and listen to us.”

For all of their time and effort,
some of the students feel
neglected by the university and
made this known by voicing
their concerns to Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes and
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
earlier this season. However,

the band has yet to see any
results of this meeting.

“The band is one of the most
dedicated organizations at this
university  as much as we’re
shunned by the administration
in their support,” senior trumpet
player Scott “Fudge” Meade
said. “We haven’t been happy
as far as support. We have no
band room, like other schools.”

The lack of a practice facility
hurts the recruiting cause, espe-
cially when high school seniors
come to Pitt and see that facili-
ties here do not equal those that
they have in high school.

The band moves ahead
despite these setbacks, and
though reasons for such
extreme dedication vary, many

band members‘spo:ke of the ‘

bonding that being a part of this
group entails. _* " >

“You join band because you
like to play your instrument.
Even after that wears off, you
still keep coming back because
of all the friends you’ve:_made,”
said Aaron Forsythe, also
known as “Jughead.”"“Especially
in the drumline, no matter how
fed up you get  you’re part of
a larger whole with a common
goal —— to do so>me serious
drumming. And that_keeps you
there.” ‘ A 

The band will present an
entire marching season of music

Lock the 

Six months ago, the world was in a time warp.
Los Angeles crashed and burned while everybody
else stood frozen because of the decision that
had just been handed down. America, the country
which for centuries had attracted immigrants" in
search of the “free and the brave,” stood as an
empty reﬂection and a false image of everything
it was not. The whole concept of “freedom and
justice for all” was’finally released from behind
the white cloud which covered it.

The white cloud was darkened, and the sky was
much more ominous. Looming over the country
was L.A. Police Chief Daryl Gates and a police
department whose job it was to provide justice.

At that time, it became all too apparent that

. those who are supposed to be upholding justice

are the ones who abuse it the most.

Yesterday, the _Pitt Program Council hosted a
debate between Gates and American Civil
Liberties Union President Nadine Strossen. The
debate was an issue that both participants were
supposed to know something about — “Law and
Order in America: Is the System Working?”

Well, the answer to that question was obvious
before the debate even began. As Strossen said,
and as Gates proved, the answer is no. But our
question is not whether or not the justice system

is working, but why on Earth would PPC bring.

somebody like Gates in to answer it? If PPC really
wanted a substantive_debate on this topic, it
could have at least brought in someone who
could show that it is working. This _was nothing
more than a frivolous and wasteful way to spend
our student fees on a subject worthy of a sub-
stantive discussion. It’s not so much that we are
upset that PPC brought Gates in, but that he dis-
cussed an issue which he clearly knows very little
about. Perhaps a Supreme Court justice or a
police chief whose officers actually respect the
law could have been brought in to debate this
issue.

But we understand that the original intent

-behind Gates’ visit was not to debate Strossen.

We also understand that'Gates was brought in
because he is an extremely infamous personality.
Despite these reasons, we still have to _ask the
question: Why Gates? And even more important-
ly: Why this debate? The debate was about justice
in America and whether the system was working.
A debate is supposed to bring two intelligent
people together to discuss an issue on which
they are diametrically opposed. .

While Strossen and Gates differed on several
points, they are both clear indicators of a system
that isn’t working. The only difference is that one
said it and the other proved it.

(DH? 1

, The eulogizing of the
Republican Party and conser-
vatismas a viable force in
American politics is premature.

Maybe.

In a country where
Democrats control Congress,
most cities and states and the
majority of public “opinion,
Republicans could take comfort
in the presidency. Last
T uesday, the Republicans even
lost that. Now what? A _

The task for the Republican
Party is to become appealing to

‘a broad public the way it was

in the 1980s. In the last decade,
the disparity between
Democrats and Republicans
narrowed. There is danger that
those gains may be lost. The
party must work to develop, a
unified message. The problems
that have plagued the
Democrats have been too
much liberal thinking and too
much pandering to various
interest groups. This year, espe-
cially at the convention in
Houston, the Republican Party
looked as if were being over-.
taken by the ultraconservative,
religious right.

The party platform called for
a Constitutional amendment to
outlaw abortion. Such a view is
bound to alienate - people. The
speeches of Pat Buchanan and
Pat Robertson, more memo-
rable than the president’s
acceptance speech, did the
same. The success of the party
in the ‘80s lay in the broad-

based coalition of conservative,

moderate and liberal
Republicans and the support of
conservative Democrats. In
order to remain important on
the American scene, the party
must move back toward the

mainstream and welcome more-

people. Ronald Reagan was an
effective mainstream
Republican. He emphasized
issues people could identify
with and the party benefitted.
Republicans have to find the
key issues in the 1990s the way
they did in the 19805.

With a Democrat in the

Don't start the death march just yet

White’ House, the Republicans
Could finally achieve the
desired gains in representation
in Congress. In midterm elec-
tions, the party out of power in
the White House traditionally
gains seats. The elections are
viewed as a statement about
the effectiveness of the presi-
_dent. The more the electorate
likes the president, the less
seats his party will lose. Right
now, the president-elect has a
difficult road ahead with both
the economy and with foreign
affairs. This is an excellent
opportunity for the
Republicans. They should prey

Ed
Kichline

on all weaknesses of the
administration, finding the
strongest candidates to chal-
lenge Democratic incumbents.
Reducing the Democratic
majority in the Congress is
essential to strengthening the
party for the future.

The search begins now for a’

candidate for president. Clinton
will likely have an advantage as
the incumbent, but a strong
candidate could pose a stiff
challenge. The Republican can-

' didate would need to have

charisma, energy, minimal neg-
atives and an appealing mes-
sage. These guidelines seem to
exclude Dan Quayle and Phil
Gramm, —_ two individuals men-
tioned as candidates. Many
Republicans favor Jack Kemp,
and it will be interesting to see
if he can appeal to the
American public. I ,
Pennsylvania in 1994 will be
a good test for the Republican
Party. The senatorial election in
1991 sent a foreboding mes-

. sage to the Republicans. The

races for senator’ and governor
could erase those errors. Harris

Wofford’s seat will be up, and,

the Republicans have a great
chance to unseat him if they
can choose a good challenger.
Health care will not have the

9 mize

saliency it did in 1991, and

Wofford will probably be with-

out political mastermind James
Carville, who helped Clinton
win the presidency.

The failures of 1991 and 1992
will 1 not be forgotten by the
Republicans. Dick Thornburgh
and George Bush underestimat-
ed their opponents and failed
to appeal to the people.
Clinton and Wofford, on the
other hand, won because they
appealed directly to the people.
The Republicans must re-learn
to listen to the people and
address their needs.

The governor’s race looks

' favorable for the Republicans.‘

Gov. Bob Casey is one of the

least popular men in the state. -
This weakens the Democrats. .

The leading Republican candi-
date right now is Attorney
General Ernie Preate. To maxi-
their chances, the
Republicans must ensure that
the primaries are not divisive.
The candidate should not be
weakened by members of his
own party. Also, Preate must
realize how the public feels
about abortion. Preate is a
prominent member of the pro-
life movement.l

If he runs for governor sup-
porting the banning of abor-
tion, he will repel the voters.
Abortion will be an issue, and
he should stick with the
Pennsylvania law he argued
before the Supreme Court.
Abortion is not a winning issue
for Republicarisf

In post-election analysis, the

Democrats and the media have
talked about fundamental prob-
lerns with the Republican Party.
The party is still alive and well.
However, the party does not
have a dominant force like
Ronald Reagan to define the
issues anymore. This year
should mark the birth of a new
Republican Party with a new
conservatism to» appeal to
America.

Musical wee/eend features seminars, concerts byjozzz greats

 

Freddie Hubbard (above) and Grover Washington, Jr. (Inset) are the two main performers at Pitt's 22nd Annual Jazz Seminar.
‘By Lane Hornfeck
Staff Writer

Flowing and abounding with funk,
rhythm and thyme, Pitt’s 22nd Annual
jazz Seminar will be held Nov. 12, 13

and 14 in the William Pitt Union. The ‘

event will culminate with the concert on
Saturday at 8 p.m. in Carnegie Music
Hall. a

Dr. Nathan Davis, professor of Jazz
studies at Pitt, has compiled one of the
hottest programs for this year’s Jazz
seminar and concert. The bill consists of
Grover Wasliington Jr. on saxophone,
Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Art Farmer

on trumpet, Mulgrew Miller on piano,
Miroslaz Vitous on bass, Philip Caterine
on guitar, Idris Muhammad on drums
and finally, Davis himself on saxophone.

Davis, who wrote the arrangements
for the concert, is planning to feature
each individual artist, allowing each the
opportunity “to do his own thing.”

Davis believes “in a high-powered,
light, exciting set” and promises that the
music is programmed for that.

“We have some straight—ahead things
— Latin, funk and some ballads; so
there is a variety of things,” Davis said.

Despite the ever—present importance
of intense music, the seminar’s concept

is focused primarily on the objective of
educating people.

Davis recalled the time when he
decided to leave Paris and return to the
United States to_ teach. Musicians
thought that he would be giving away
the secrets of the music, During the ‘SOs
there weren’t Jazz studies programs at
universities and conservatories, so the
musician had to learn the hard way —
on the road.

It was people like Kenny Clarke,
Donald Byrd and Dizzy Gillespie who
encouraged Davis to come back to the
United States and get into teaching.
According to Davis, Gillespie once said

that “we needcats with a degree,
because not enough cats have experi-
ence and a degree.”

“Most of the guys said it was a cop-
out. Now it’s different; everybody wants
to teach. It's the thing to do,” Davis said.

When Davis first started teaching in“

1969, it was a rare thing. Along with
Dave Baker and Donald Byrd, Davis
was a pioneer for Jazz education in this
country. _

“At first the universities wanted to hire
musicologists, the classicists, to teach
jazz,” Davis said. “They wanted to give
the Jazz" musicians a non—tenured, part-

New chair
Coleman
steers Pitt
theater

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

“Being an actor allows me the

luxury of not having to play a.

number of roles in life because
I’ve played so many onstage,”
says Stephen Coleman, the new
chair of Pitt’s theater department.

Coleman, who previously

‘headed the university’s Masters

of Fine Arts acting program,
plans to bring change and a
sense of community to Pitt
Theatre. Over the past few
years, different sections of the
department have segregated
themselves and worked as indi-
entities. This year
Coleman hopes to bridge the
void between the graduate stu-
dents and the undergrads as
well as between the acting,
directing and technical theater‘
departments.

Because awareness of Pitt
Theatre is marginal on campus,
the department must work twice
as hard to get the word out
about upcoming productions. In
addition, the department is
undergoing a transitional year
due to the financial troubles of
the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival. Coleman cited the
importance of retaining the festi-
val. , -
“T RSF is not only an educa-
tional tool, but it is also a profes-
sional outlet for the university
community,” he said.

The 1992 year was a difficult
one for theater in general.
Several theaters suffered ﬁnan-
cially, including TRSF. Under
Co'leman’s watchful eye the
TRSF is up for review by a board

Pitt's The Ro veer ;. is an enj aetheatrical experience

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

Aphra Behn wrote The
Rover during the the
Restoration of the 17th centu-
ry, which is sometimes
referred to as .“The Silver
Age.” It was a time of glitter-
ing chandeliess and intricate
silver tea services, a world
full of artificial beauty.
“Beauty patches” were worn
by both sexes to cover blem-
ishes, and wigs were never
more popular. Society pre-
scribed an elaborate code of
etiquette and morals while
explorations into sexual free-
dom were continuing. The
theater of the period reflect-
ed these layers of propriety
and sensuality, producing
many satirical comedies
which delved into the con-
trasts between manners and
morality with surprising
depth.

The Rover is no exception

to this rule. It explores the
themes of male-female rela-
tionships, and the connec-
tions (or lack thereof, in
some cases) between love,
sex, morality and marriage
with the keen, bawdy wit
that isetypical to theater dur-
ing the restoration. However,
this play has a couple of
unusual twists — it was writ-
ten by a woman, and the
female characters have the
upper hand. They actively
shape their own destinies
and choose the men they will
love and marry.

Three of the play’s central
female characters are sisters
— Florinda (Candice Brown-
McDonald), Hellena (Brynn
Bennett) and Valeria (Patricia
Meade). All three are trying
to break out of the destinies
ordained for them by their
oppressive brother, Don

Pedro (BJ. Williams). They

Tico and Alec return to the
MTV and radio airwaves with a
12-track message of positive
change entitled Keep The
Faith.

Saturated with the message
of hope, perseverance and
(predictably) faith, Faith
attempts to showcase the
band’s newfound attitude
about life, love and the mean-
ing of togetherness.

It’s a logical theme in light
of the rumored rift that split
the heart of the band — singer
Jon Bon Jovi and smooth lead
guitarist Richie Sambora — a

few years ago. But regardless
of the whole, sentiment-thing,
it’s no excuse for the band’s
insistence in departing from
what got them where they are
— namely cranking out user-
friendly, believable, cheesy
rock tunes.

The “growing as a band”
concept behind most of Faith
is noble, but it’s just not that
good. Want examples? Listen
to “In These Arms.” With Jon
waxing bogus sugary senti-
ment from the get-go, “Arms”
rambles on aimlessly for five-
plus minutes without ever

kicking in like you’d expect

from a mid-tempo Jovi simmer.

Abdullah SABIT (from Bosnia)
on Nov. 15th, (Friday), 1992 7:00 PM
at CL 324 (Cathedral of.Learning).

“Bed of Roses” is bound to
be a hit solely on the fact that
it has a perfect ballad title
(ﬂower titles in a ballad are a
cinch), but it’s not happening.
Period. It’s pure sentimental
glop. Check this line out:
“Sitting here wasted and
wounded at this old piano/
Trying hard to capture the
moment this morning I don’t
know/ ‘Cause a bottle of
vodka is still lodged in my
head.” Ugh! A

“Dry Country,” “Fear” and
“Little Bit of Soul” also employ
the same soci_al—awareness
theme that drives the album’s
title track, only they fail miser-
ably in their attempts to entice
emotion or thinking out of the
listener. It’s almost as if the
band was forced to sing these
songs — regardless of the
obviously thin content.

There area few tolerable,
radio-friendly tunes that keep
Faith from becoming totally
intolerable. They might even
be successful enough to keep
this sedate album from falling
comple.tely on its face.

  This Friday, in theatres across America, the director of

ettable love story ever told...

“I Believe,” the first cut on
the album, combines the airy,
drum—driven Bon Jovi sound
with the muttered vocals of
Jon “This Ain’t No Blaze of
Glory 11” Bon jovi, creating a
semi—believab1e positive mes-
sage of self—motivation: “Don’t
look up on your movie
screens/ in record stores or
magazines/ Close your eyes
and you will see/ that you are
all you will really need/ I
believe — I believe.”

“I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead”
could’ve been on an old Bon
Jovi album —— employing a
silly sing—along chorus along-

’ side a jazzed—up framework of

rock sound. It’s the tightest
and best tune on the album.

“Keep The Faith” — the
band’s first video/single —-—
also captures the enthusiasm
that made tight cuts from
“Slippery When Wet” and
“New Jersey” so popular.

Kicked into light, toe—tappin’
gear by way of some groovin’
bass and drum work, Faith
once again embarks on that
“we want to prove that we
care about the world” vibe that
the band seems determined to
sell to music fans and critics in
this album: “Everybody needs
somebody to love/ Everybody
needs somebody to hate/
Everybody’s bitching ‘cause
they can’t get enough/ And it’s
hard to hold on — when
there’s no one to lean on.”

If onlythe Bon Jovers could
sustain this believablevibe
throughout the whole album.
_That’s probably too much to
ask. ‘

Izzy Stradlin and the
Ju Ju Hounds
Geffen Records

Izzy gonna be all right.

After blowing through the
sonic gymnastics of the ex-
Guns-and-Roses’ guitarist and
his new-found foils, that’s
exactly what you’ll think when
considering the future of this
rock quartet.

Riding a skeleton framework
of classic rock chords, the
reborn Stradlin guides the Ju
Ju Hounds through 10 mega-
_blistering-cool rockers in bril-

liant fashion — rendering a,

debut album that any rock
wannabes would be proud of.
The only thing they messed
up on is the album’s title‘. This
self-titled album should’ve
been called Exile on Stradlin
Street or Sucking in the 903.
It’s that pseudo—Rolling
Stones-ish. It’s also that good.
Stradlin doesn’t waste any
time in proving his worth in
the rock business, rollin’ from
the get—go with “Somebody

Knockin, a rollicking tune
that thrives on a simple rhythm
guitar and Izzy’s best Keith
Richard rasp impression. Like
most songs on the debut com-
pilation. “Somebody” mixes
indistinguishable lyrics (trou-

time position. Jazz musicians,
great Jazz musicians, ’were
teaching at four or five different
universities to make one salary.

“David Baker and I fought
that. Here at Pitt and at Indiana
University, actually, we have set
a precedent with all of the hon-
ors and rank that go with it.
The new president of Indiana
University called David Baker
over to his house the second
day on campus and named him
a distinguished professor,
because he respects his work
and commitment. Now you’re
seeing more and more schools
give tenured teaching‘ positions;
it’s a testament to our fight.”

Pitt’s seminars are taught by
some of the most famous, edu-
cated Jazz mu. rcians of today,
incorporating not on‘. ,1 cats with
the ability to play, but those
with a degree as well. The
musicians should be viewed as
visiting professors. And as far as
Davis is concerned “we can list
them as our prestigious faculty.”

will love and marry instead
of complying with arranged
marriages and forced dedica-

'tions to the church. Their

chances come during the
Naples Carnival, in which
they roam dressed as
Gypsies, able to freely pur-
sue their desires.

Bennett plays Hellena, the
most adventurous sister, with
real spark. She handles her
many “asides” to the audi-
ence with comedic skill,
resisting the temptation to
overplay them, As a result,
she turns in one of the best
performances of the show.
Her character’s single-minded
determination to win
Willmore (Greg
Longenhagen) and avoid life
in the nunnery is perfectly
suited to Bennett’s high-ener-
gy portrayal._

McDonald and Meade are
well—matched as the other,
slightly more “proper” sisters.
They mince across the stage
and snap their fans in unison
perfectly. Meade is a flirta-
tious Valeria, simpering inno-
cently at every man in the
cast. She gives a delightful
performance in one of the
show’s smaller roles.
McDonald plays Florinda
well, with perfectly—timed
reactions and a delicate ﬂair.
However, her performance is
much like those she gave in
the Shakespeare Festival this
summer. Typecasting is
unavoidable in the theater,
and her portrayal is well-suit-
ed to the role, but it would
be nice to see her in some-
thing different.

The other featured female

characters are a collection of_

courtesans (high-class prosti-
tutes) whose attitudes on life
and love provide a counter-
point to the sisters’ attitudes.

year’s seminar, just recorded a
new album, Live at Fat
Tuesdays, which is a club in
New York. With him on the gig
were young talented players
such as Javon Jackson on tenor
saxophone, Benny Greene on
piano, Tony Reedus on drums
and Christian McBride on bass.
Hubbard, who won a
Grammy in 1973' for his album
First Light, met Davis years ago
when he was playing with Art
Blakey and the jazz
Messengers. They recently per-

’ formed together at the Music

Educators Conference in Monte
Carlo. I

“Nathan was one of the
teachers, and I was one of the
performers. It brought in stu-
dents from all over Europe and
music educators from different
universities,” Hubbard said.

Conferences like the annual
jazz seminar at Pitt and the
Monte Carlo conference grant
talented musicians like
Hubbard the forum and ability
to teach young, talented music
students.

“Whenever Nathan calls me

to do these things, I do it
because I see what he’s trying
to do — teach the people,”
Hubbard said.

“Now you can get a degree in
this music. When I went to
school in the ‘50s at Jordan
Conservatory in Indianapolis,
Indiana there were only classi-
cal [degrees]; we now have pro-
fessionals come in to a legiti-
mate study.”

It is unfortunate that Jazz
music was developed in this
country, and yet it has never
received the true respect. It was
never considered as viable as
classical music.

“Before, there weren’t books
or literature on these people,
which make [the music] more
legitimate,” Hubbard said. I

Hubbard, who likes to create
lines that are difficult to play
and understand, learned from

some of the best Jazz trum-
peters back in the ‘S05 and ‘60s
— Miles Davis and Gillespie.
He feels that it is unfortunate
that there is such an unaware-
ness of Jazz in the United
States.

“They like the music more
over [in Europe] than they do
here,” Hubbard said. “Art
Blakey told me that music
washes away the dust of every-
day life. Jazz is played to culti-
vate minds and enlighten peo-

ple about life, because jazz is.

life. This is great what Nathan is
doing  bringing these differ-
ent kinds of people together
and teaching them about Jazz.”
According to Hubbard, it is
through going into the schools
and educating people that Jazz
will truly permeate the society
of today. However, Hubbard
stresses that it is ultra—important

that musicians take business
courses along with studying
music, because most of the
managers will take advantage
of musicians.

This year’s seminar is not
only dedicated to the impor-
tance of education but also to
the efforts of two of the great
innovators in Jazz history —
Gillespie and Billy Eckstein.

Fortunately for the University
of Pittsburgh community, the
seminar has had support from
top administrators like Donald
Henderson, who has been there
from the beginning. According
to Davis, had it not been for
Henderson the seminar and
concert series would not be
here. Now Chancellor Dennis
O’Connor and William Harmon,
vice chancellor of Student
Affairs, actively support the
seminar.

gestures.

The gentlemen of The
Rover are also well played.
Williams is‘ a masterful Don
Pedro, aptly conveying the
dominant role fathers and
brothers played in a woman’s
life during this period. Kevin
McDonald makes a gentle
Belvile, the object of
Florinda’s affections. His per-
formance has an understated
intensity, which provides a
wonderful contrast to the
abject fire of the other princi-
pal male players. Bradford
Olson gives a particularly
memorable performance as
Blunt, a ridiculous country
gentleman.

Longenhagen portrays
Willmore, the rover of the
play’s title. A soldier of for-'
tune, Willmore is the link
between many of the other
cast members. Longenhagen
is excellent in the role, cov-
ering his character’s cheating,
lying and womanizing with a
charming, likeable surface.
He is thedarkest character in
this play, for all the window-
dressing charm he exudes.
Longenhagen carries this
well, conveying both aspects
of the character.

As usual, Pitt’s production
values are top—notch (espe-
cially the swordplayi), and
the play is well worth seeing.
Its commentary on women
has relevance in today’s soci-
ety, and it’s a truly enjoyable
piece of theater as well. '

Coleman

Continued from page 9

of internal constituents from the universi-
ty as well as two outside consultants.
After trimming the fat from the program,
the festival will emerge with enhanced
resources and a slightly shorter season.

One of the new additions to the perfor-
mance season is the Master of Fine Arts
Repertory series. Second and third-year
MFA students perform two plays, Mad
Forest and The Rover, simultaneously over

 

 ‘,’Novein'b’er" "is'2‘,‘i99'2“*_

a two—week run. Another new element in
the Pitt Theatre formula is a series called
“First Wednesdays.” Coleman said this
program will give people _in the theater
community as well as theater civilians the
opportunity to come together, witness a
scene and then discuss and analyze what
they’ve seen.

“Hopefully this will bridge the gap
between formal study of theater and actu-
al performance,” he said.

Coleman, who has been a professor of
theater at Pitt for several years, forges
ahead with new ideas and plans for the
department yet still manages to keep his
career in perspective. In addition to
teaching, he directs several stage produc-
tions each year and leases himself out as

* a professional character actor. .

Coleman has one of those instantly rec-
ognizable faces — probably because he’s
done over a dozen ﬁlms, over 200 stage

roles and an innumerable number of
commercials. Next term Coleman will
direct A Month in the Country by Ivan
Turgenev continuing the mainstage sea-
son. He described it as a mid-19th-centu-
ry Russian comedy. .

Coleman feels a deep sense of satisfac-
tion in performing and directing through
the accolades of a job well done. But in
teaching, he finds gratification through
seeing improvement in his students. .

   

Continued from page'10
repeated playback.

After “Somebody,” the Ju Ju
Hounds_prove their sonic
worth with a, heated jaunt
called “Pressure Drop” — a
fuzz-busting rambler that.
strives for complete stereo hys-
teria thanks to some tough
drumwork by backbeater
Charlie “Chalo” Quintana._ _
Though only the chorus is
understandable, the .vocals live
it up big, courtesy‘ of some
quirky “ooh-oohs” by Stradlin
and the Ju Jus’ background
gang bantering. The tune’s
ending is the topper —‘— a
smooth, downshifted reggae
humfest that ebbs with the
word “Ahh!” — A

The fun doesn’t end there.
In tune number three, Stradlin
steals the vibe of Eric
Clapton’s sweet version of
“Willie and the Handjive” in
the slumbering song “Time
Gone By.” ' '

Izzy’s vocals border on the
Peter Gabriel/Bob Marley
throaty side, rendering a
peaceful reflective tone that
parallels ‘the sobered-up
Stradlin’s new life in music:
“Received a letter .'.. from
oversea/ said if you come
would you like to see
me/ may not recognize me/
time has changed my face/
Time fills the pages/ turn the
page/ time will not stop over
 will turn its weight on you.”
The song hints of the breakup
of Stradlin and G—’N’-R in a
smooth, positive manner.

The album’s first single,
“Shuffle it Off,” is the first
release for a good reason: It’s
the hottest tune of them all.
Again borrowing. from the
gods of rock — this time the
bass linefrom Lou Re‘ed’s
“Wildside” and the back vocals
from the Stones’ “Miss You” — '
“Shufﬂe” strolls like a shot of
whiskey that bites back in all
the right ways. Ouch and yeah
all in one!

The theme of “give me more
hurtin’ rock” is applied in
spades (and shots) through the
rest of the album. Songs like
“Train Tracks,” “Cuttin’ The
Rug” and “Come On Now
Inside” are must—listens for
those who think themselves
the most ardent of rock afi-
cionados. They are merely
great in comparison to the
aforementioned classic tracks.

Top to bottom, Stradlin’s
debut is packed with tight,
tough rock ‘n’ roll — unpre-
tentious, refreshing and worthy
of sitting alongside’ great rock
CD5 on any collector’s shelf.

‘By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Two years ago, a power-
house Louisville team came
into Pitt Stadium, charged
out to a 27-6 lead and held
on for a 27-20 victory over
the Panthers.

That Cardinal
team featured
an explosive
offense led by
quarterback
B r o W n i n g
Nagle, who
completed 13 of 22 passes
for 177 yards and one touch-
down in the game. He is
now battling Ken OfBrien for
the starting quarterback job
with the New York Jets.

The guy who really burned
Pitt on that day, halfback
Ralph Dawkins, is still
around. He rushed for 88
yards and caught five passes
for 69 yards in that game.

 

. ....«lr aw.-m ...«:..=g—.....n 4»-., ...—‘3_

 

Both numbers were tops on
the team.

Dawkins is still carrying
the load -‘for the Louisville
offense. He averages 121.8
yards of total offense per
game, more than a quarter of
the team’s total of 402.5 per
game.

He has carried the ball
twice as many times as any
other back on the team,
rolling up 481 yards and
seven scores despite an aver-
age of only 3.2 yards per
carry for the season. The
team only has 966 total yards
rushing. Junior Anthony
Shelman has come on lately
and now has 350 yards and a
5.1 yards per carry average.

Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said he was
impressed by the running
game against national power
Texas A&M last week.

Those backs ran behind an

offensive line with. only one.

coach _ Howard
Schnellenberger said his
young offensive line is better
than the one his team had
two years ago when the
team was 10-1, including the
win over Pitt.

Behind the line is junior
quarterback Jeff Brohm.
After seeing minimal action
as _a first-year student,
including some time against
Pitt, Brohm was slated to
take Nagle’s place last year.
That plan ended when

Dozw/ems
carries Zoom’
for Cardinals

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Louisville halfback Ralph
Dawkins may have to see a

' chiropractor after this season,

since" the all-purpose back
has had to carry the team’s
offense on his back.

As he finds himself moving
toward the end zone it makes
no difference to Dawkins
whether it be on the ground
or through the air. He leads
all Louisville backs, with 407
yards rushing and seven
touchdowns. Dawkins is also
the Cardinal’s leading receiver
so far this year with 43 catch-
es for 506 yards receiving and
three scores. On top of those
duties, Dawkins also returns
kickoffs and punts if need be.

Multiple duties is nothing
new for Dawkins. He has led
his team in rushing and
receiving the past two sea-

A sons. Dawkins was the only

player in Louisville history to
lead the Cardinals in rushing
in each of his first two sea-
sons. 5

Over the last two years,
Dawkinshas carried the ball
more than all other Cardinal
backs combined — amassing
over 2,300 yards of total
offense — with the rest of
this season and all of next
season still remaining.

“Ralph. Dawkins has been
our go-to man these past two
seasons,” Louisville head

See Dawkins, page P-11

great mold  

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

When you think of the
great players that Howard
Schnellenberger has pro-
duced, you usually think of
great quarterbacks.

Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar,
Browning Nagle, Ray
Buchanan. Buchanan? That’s
right. Buchanan is a great
one. The only thing that
separates him from the other
names is that he is a free
safety.

Buchanan has seen it all as
a Louisville Cardinal. He saw
a football program explode
on the national scene when
the Cards won the 1991
Fiesta Bowl over Alabama,
and he has seen a program
fall on its face when the
next season it went 2-9.

Saturday, Alex ’Van Pelt
and the Pitt Panther offense
will have seen enough of
Buchanan.

“[Buchanan' has been] tout-
ed as one of the finest‘
safeties in the country and is
as good a safety as we have
seen all year long,” Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett said.
“That whole secondary has
great speed and great quick-
ness. It is going to be an
excellent. test _for us.
Certainly we are up to it. We
are playing at our peak.”

Buchanan is the leader of
that secondary — the heart
of the Cardinal defense —
and has been for the past
three seasons, so expect him
to make the key plays to
lead the team. '

Louisville defensieliibraces for Pitt onslaught

 Jiiriliiakely
Managing Editor

The Pitt [Panthers (3-6)
have one more opportunity
to showcase their high-pow-
ered passing attack in front
of the home crowd.

And the thought of being
the potential
victim of Alex
Van Pelt’s last
hurrah does

not sit well

with Louisville

(4-6) head
coach Howard
Schnellenberger.

“Obviously, what we see

is an offense that is proba-

bly the best [offense] in the
nation,” Schnellenberger

said. “One of the most excit-
ing and difficult [teams] to
defense that we have seen.
[Pitt] has a quarterback
that’s very special  so it’s
going to be a real test for
our defense to contain —
obviously we can’t control
—- but to contain this great
offense.”

If the Cardinals have any
hope of containing that
offense and escaping with a
victory, much of that hope
will fall on the shoulders of
preseason All-American
senior safety Ray Buchanan.
He leads a secondary that
Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said may be the
toughest challenge Van Pelt
has met all season.

“[Buchanan] is touted as
one of the finest safeties in
the country and is as good a
safety as we have seen all
year long,” Hackett said.
“That whole secondary has
great speed and great quick-
ness. It is going to be an
excellent test for us.
Certainly we are’ up to it.
We are playing at our
peak.”

The Panthers will have to
keep their offensive attack
balanced between the pass
and the run to keep one of
the youngest defensive units
in the country guessing.

“If they look at us as a
passing team, we gotta run,”
Hackett said. “We gotta
keep it mixed up to beat

them.”

What the Cardinal defense
lacks in age, it makes up for
in depth and the experience
of playing against some of
the best teams in the coun-
try. ,
Louisville has played four
teams ranked in the Top 20
this year — and has played
them well. The Cardinal
defense gained respect
against Ohio State and
Syracuse, giving>up 20 and
15 points respectively in
tight games. It has proven
that it can defend the run
(in containing the powerful
Texas A&M rushing attack
for three-and-a-half quarters
last week) as well as the

The U. of A. win throws a

(Oregon State, at Wash. St.),
the Huskies clinch the Rose

If Washington has to forfeit
the games that Hobert
played in, things get real

could emerge as the victor
of this match-up.

Arizona comes in blister-

Schoolboys come back ffrom‘la‘y-off with a) vengeance

where they haven’t lost yet.
To- boot, USC is seeking
revenge after back-to-back
humiliating losses vs.
Arizona.

Trojan defense is playing
well and offense clicking
strong, despite a season-low
nine points at Stanford last
week. Oddsmakers are

.being "generous to Trojans '

by inﬂating the line to two-
and-a-half. We like USC at
home, but aren’t willing to
lay over a field goal as
Arizona’s “D” is too strong.
Don’t bite on a Trojan over-
lay. The ‘Zona bandwagon
is due to derail and the hot
California sun is a prime
spot for a jumping. Take
USC - 2 1/ 2 cautiously.

She stood there primed like
an F-15 on an aircraft carrier
runway, her shirt-sleeve
rolled up above the shoulder
exposing a left arm like a
sidewinder missile, waiting to
fire. '

For what seemed like an
eternity, Ann Marie Lucanie
stood on the runway know'n
as the Fitzgerald Field House
volleyball court and waited.
The set floate_cl through the
air with_ all the motion of a
knuckle ball, hovering above
her. until she could not wait
any longer.

Five steps and 12 feet later,
Lucanie' was airborne. Witli

a

legs bent backward, back
arched and left arm cocked,
she zeroed in on the hapless
target in front of her, locked
on and fired. Her left arm cut
through the air like an air-to-
air missile, and connected
with the ball, send-
ing it over the net
with a thunderous
boom between
two blockers and
down for the point.

plished. -

If Air Force terminology
can be applied to the sport
of volleyball, then Lucanie,-a
junior outside hitter and All-

volleyball team, would be
known as a Top Gun.

Her skill and talent make
the fundamentals of hitting
look very easy. To the
untrained eye, orto those
who have never played vol-
leyball at a level higher than
picnic ball, hitting would
appear to involve
nothing more than
jumping as high as
.you can, swinging
as fast as you can
and hitting as hard
as you can.
Anyone who has
played the game competitive-
ly will say there isa lot more
to hitting than meets the eye.

“People think it’s very
easy,” Pitt head coach Sue
W'oodstra said. “But what
they don’t understand is the

in e an 

complexities that go into all
aspects of the kill — the
approach, the velocity, the
follow through. It’s not sim-
ple at all.”

Lucanie, as well as the rest
of the players on the Pitt vol-
leyball team, are the products
of years of experience on the
court. From high school to
club to junior national teams,
each has worked very hard
to hone her skills. While
some skills are easier to
refine than others, hitting
seems to be the most reward-
ing, yet difficult, to master.

“As a hitter, I know I‘m on
when I can go up and see
the whole side of the other
court and I can hit it down,”

 LuXbachere

receives Big

East award
ByBrian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

Following a‘ record—setting
1992 season, Pitt soccer head
coach Joe Luxbacher was
named Big East'Coach of the
Year at the postseason league
banquet last weekend in Stoirs,
Conn. I

In his ninth year at Pitt,
Luxbacher led the Panthers to
one of the biggest turnarounds
in conference history, guiding
his team to a S~2—1 regular—sea—
son league mark in ‘92. Last
year Pitt went winless in Big
East play (()—6—2 in 1991). -

For Luxbacher, the award ‘

was like his overachieving ‘92
team: an o_ut—of—the—b'lue, posi-
tive surprise.

“I hadn’t expected it,”
Luxbacher said. “It was a nice
surprise.”

While Luxbacher was appre-
ciative of the honor, he was
quick to note the true factors
behind gaining the accolade.

“It’s a tribute to the players,”
Luxbacher said. “I didn’t score
the goals. I didn’t play defense.
As a result of the team’s effort,
I get the award.

“It’s nice. But it’s for the
kids.”

While the conference
acknowledged the work of the
Panthers’ head coach, no Pitt
player was named ‘ to the
league’s All—Conference team.
Luxbacher said he feels the
lack of a Pittsburgh player on
the team is an injustice because
the Panthers contended for the
league title all season.

“It disappoints me,”

Luxbacher said. “I didn’t think

they gave. us much credit all

year long. We wind up in sec~ .

0nd place overall  and no
one gets on all-conference.

Upon, reading the article in
The Pitt News concerning the
rowing team, I was greatly
disturbed. As a virtual
founder, four—year head
coach and life—1ong stake
holder in the crew, I felt it
my duty to clarify some
skewed facts from the article.

The Pitt Crew became a
highly competitive body dur~
ing the winter of the 1988-’89

school year. In that first
spring we accomplished the ‘

impossible, winning a. title in

a ‘varsity event with novices *

at the Mid-America Collegiate
Rowing Championships and
medaling at the Dad Vail
regatta, which in your article
was referred to as the
National Championships. For
the record, the Collegiate

National Championships are
in June in Cincinnati, Ohio,
not the Dad Vail, which is in
Philadelphia in May.

Second, since 1989 the Pitt
Crew has medaled three
boats at the Dad Vail, includ-
ing having thci fastest
American Men’s pair last year
and the top—ranked men’s
top four. Furthermore, three
individuals. from that men’s
four went onto win a true
national championship last
July. J

The Pitt crew is in no way
adopting a new attitude
geared toward competition
this year. It has been there
all along. What else would
be the impetus behind 34 of
the rowers last year forgoing
their spring break to travel to

“Florida not to party, but to

‘spend five to six hours a day
on the water training? They
did more work in a week
than many crews do in a
month.

No, the Pitt crew is not a
new body that is trying to
establish a tradition; it is an
established body with a rich
tradition.

In summation, I would like
to list some final facts. The
Pitt crew over the _last three
year has averaged 25 medals
per year. A boat of Pitt row-
ers that graduated last year
travelled to the Head of the
Charles Regatta this year,
and, despite not having
rowed together since May,

placed 10th out of 40 in.

championship fours, not club

Former rowing club coach defends his record at Pitt

fours like the current rowers.

To put this in perspective,
the winner of club fours was
Rocky Mountain Rowing Club
in a time of 17:10.40, and the
winners of championship
fours were four Olympic
gold medalists from the
Canadian Olympic team in a
time of 13:59:28. Incidentally,
the Pitt Alumni finished in

16:55.98 and would have

won club fours had they not
been ineligible due to some
of the rowers’ statuses as
national champions.

I do support the new
coaches in their mission to
continue the competitive tra-
dition of the Pitt Crew, and I
do encourage people to try
rowing. -But as it was my

record that was being inaccu-

rately stated by three people
—- Rick Kelliher, Mary Gott
and Anne Schleicher —— all of
whom were not even at the
University of Pittsburgh last
year, I felt it was imperative
that I reply.>Anyone who was
here last year was able to
follow our outstanding sea-
son through the articles of
The Pitt News’ own Brian
Gallagher.

The Pitt crew is a body
destined for greatness, but
the seeds for that were sown
long before Rick, Mary and
Annie ever came to
Pittsburgh.

Sincerely,
Joel J. Kehm

Brohm does bring the
dimension of being a good
scrambler to the offense.

“I think Brohm will be a
class quarterback in good
time,” Schnellenberger said.
“He is very important to our
offense. As our quarterback
goes, our offensive team
goes?

When Brohm looks down
field, the first guy he finds is

—gsurprise — Dawkins. He
has grabbed 43 passes for
506 yards and three touch-
downs. Fullback Jamie Asher
is next with 20 receptions.
Quarterback Brohm’s brother

‘Greg Brohm is tops among

wide receivers with 18 catch-
es this year.

The Louisville offense has
improved as the season has
gone on, but it is no jugger-
naut. Paul Hackett said this

is a good opportunity to see
how far the defense has pro-
gressed.

The Pitt defense must do a.
decent job shutting down
this shaky offense as the
explosive Panther offense
will be taking on a tough
Cardinal defense.

Unfortunately for Pitt,
decent has been too much to
ask of its defense this sea-
son. '

coach Howard
Schnellenberger said.
“Now with the depth we
have in the backfield,
[Dawkinsl can be even
more effective this year.”

Dawkins is a 5-foot-
9inch, 195-pound junior
from William. M. Raines
High‘ School in
Jacksonville, Florida.

Besides running, catch-
ing passes and returning
kickoffs and punts,
Dawkins is an excellent.
blocker as well. He has
even attempted three pass-

‘ es this year, completing
two in'cluding one touch-
down._That is an improve-
ment on last year, when all

three of his passes fell
incomplete.

Last year Dawkins was
selected by his teammates
as team MVP as well as
most outstanding back. His
outstanding all-around per-
formance on the field last
year earned him honorable
mention All-American sta-
tus.

This Saturday, in order
for the Panthers to beat the
Cardinals, they will have to
stop Dawkins.

“Louisv_ille plays hard
and is well coached 
they h-ave an exciting run-
ning back in Ralph
Dawkins,” Pitt head foot-
ball coach Paul_Hackett
said.

“They don’t beat them-

are a scary team, particularly
on defense. They may be as
good a defensive football
team as-we have played all

Schnellenberger, a national
championship coach for the
Miami Hurricanes in 1983,
brought that successful defen-
sive scheme with him to
Louisville. The Cardinals play
with four down linemen,
three linebackers and an

umbrella of defensive backs '

behind them.

They can stop the run
because of great speed and
solid tackling as proven by

their success in shutting
down Syracuse’s quick option
game (some_thing Pitt has his-
torically had problems con-
taining).

Gaines round out a deep
defensive backfield that will
be battling not only the
efforts of Van Pelt, but
fatigue. The Cardinals will
wrap up a four-game road
trip and their season Saturday
afternoon. “
“The fact that they are play-
ing four games in a row has
to be tough for them, but I’ll
tell you_what: They’re impres-
sive,” Hackett said. “They’re
young and“. frisky. They run
around. Particularly their sec-
ondary is outstanding.”
Hackett said that the fatigue
factor may sway this

ballgamein the Panthers’
favor, citing personal experi-
ence. On Sept. 12, Pitt lost an
emotional game to West
Virginia «University and then
traveled to play Rutgers on
only three days rest. It was a
challenge that the Panthers
were unable to meet —— a
challenge that Hackett hopes
Louisville will also fail to
meet.

“That’s the closest thing

that has happened to Pitt that
[Louisville has] undergone,”
H_ackett said‘. “[When you
don’t rest], you don’t play
well.”

what I do out there on

defensive side of the
ball,” Buchanan said.

A 1992 Playboy All-
American, Buchanan

lades on his list of
accomplishments. In
1991, he ranked. fourth
nationally in intercep-
tions (eight), along
with being named to
the Associated Press
All-South first team.
He was also named
Defensive MVP in the
1991 Fiesta Bowl.

“I’m just a player. I’m
just going to go out
there and play every
down as hard as I
can,” Buchanan said
about his All-American
status.

Last season,
Buchanan was third on
the team with 108 tack-
les and led the team
with eight intercep-
tions. This year he is
continuing the same
success.

director and anyone else ——
Van Pelt is still overrated.
He makes too many mis-
takes and fails to punch it in
from the red zone. After Van
pelt went down early
against Syracuse, we saw
glimpses of the future with
john Ryan at the helm.

At this point, the defense
is better off blitzing every

P-lﬁ

down in hopes of a big
play. And the same goes for
the woeful special teams
unit where recklessness
might be an inspiration. The
last time it played in Pitt
Stadium, the special units
turned into a nightmarish
sideshow in which using the
word disaster would be a
tender understatement.

Lucanie said. .

“It’s a great feeling when
you’re hitting well. It feels like
you’re up in the air a long
time.”

The art of the kill involves
certain technical fundamentals.
Like any sport, footwork is

very important to being suc- A

cessful.
“If a player is on the court
and doesn’t have proper foot-

work, it can make all the dif-
ference in her success,”
Woodstra said. “You have to
be in control of your body at
all times and have a good cen-
ter of gravity, otherwise you
may end up in the net or
underneath the ball on the
approach.”

The approach is also crucial.
Jump too soon on a kill, and a

hitter may hit the ball too,

net and onto I-79. Jump too
late and the hitter is doomed
to hit the ball into the net.

“Speed is very important on
the approach, but it has to be
controlled speed,” Woodstra
said. “If a player goes too fast, ’
that leaves them off balance
and going forward on their
jump. That happens a lot to
the younger players.”

Another aspect that younger
players have difficulty with,
according to Woodstra, is what
is known as “seeing the
block,” where a hitter can see
the opposing players on the
other side at the same time she
sees the set, and know where
to hit it where they can’t get
it. This involves experience
and teamwork.

“Young players tend to focus
only on the ball and hit it as
hard as they can,” Woodstra
said. “As a player gets more
experience, her peripheral

can see the set in the air and
the defense at the same time.
It is a hard thing to learn but,
once learned, makes things a
lot easier.”

Players also credit their back
row teammates on successful
hitting.

“It makes it easier to kill
when the back line tells you
where the defense is,” Pitt
middle hitter Carrie Thornton
said. “That way you know
whether to go down the line
or cross court.”

Contrary to popular belief,
there is more to killing than
smashing the ball as hard as
possible. The “dink” is under-
rated and can also be equally
as effective. ‘

“Am [Lucanie] is very good
at it,” Woodstra said. “It just
adds another shot to a player’s
repertoire to put the ball any-
where, and most importantly,
it makes the defense think. It
can really confuse them and

change momentum.”

Hitting, in addition to
its technical aspects, requires
a certain mental approach
to be successful and consis-
tent, according to the players.

“You have to be aggressive
and go at it full force,”
Thornton said. “You can’t let
up.” A

“The best feeling is to put it
away without anyone touching

-it,”, first-year middle hitter

Alyssia Yanik said. “When you
can see the seams, you know
it’s a good set. It makes it easi-
er to hit and easier to crush.”

If the kill in volleyball is the
equivalent to the home run in
baseball, the dunk in basket-
ball and the goal in hockey,
then what would the players
say is the ultimate kill?

“I dream of doing it against
the top—ranked team in the
NCAA’s at game point,”
first-year player Sara Mitchell
says.

bowl season and the loser
here can pack it in. Rutgers,
facing only three teams with
a winning record all season,
has lost by an average
of over 14 points in
those matchups. Still, the
Scarlet Knights can salvage
a fairly impressive home
campaign‘ (4-1) with a big
win here. But they must
rebound from a humbling
road loss at Virginia Tech,
not to mention in—house
troubles, as defensive line
coach jeter wasarrested
recently in a raid of a crack
house.

The Mounties, on, the
other hand, have been rack-
ing up big numbers on
offense all year and got
back on a winning track last
week against East Carolina
after dropping three
toughies against Miami,
Penn State and Syracuse.

Despite defensive liabilities, -

we prefer to shade WVU’s
offense potency and emerg-

‘ ing RB Adrian Murrellr——

who is easily the best player
on the field. Expect him to
rumble for over 100 yards
and a couple of TD’s as
Mountaineers win handily
and push the win streak to
eight against Rutgers. Take
WVU-4. ’

Bonus Babies: Hawaii
Rainbows (7-1) +4 1/2 at
SD State Aztecs (4-3-1)

The Rainbows can clinch
the WAC crown_ with a win
against a sporadic SD State
bunch. Must respect the
presence of sensational tail-
back Marshall Faulk, but
Hawaii counters with its
own groundeater, big tail-
back Travis Sims (averaging
6.2 yards a pop).

State has faltered at
crucial times on  This
campaign and stop unit
is shaky. The Rainbows
are sound and balanced on
both sides of the ball. SD
State is an impressive 6-1
vs. spread in this WAC
matchup, but Hawaii is an

unbelievable 14-1 vs.‘ spread
in the last 15 on wacky
WAC road. Plus, ‘the
Rainbows have won four
straight and 5-1-1 on the
year vs. the line. Take
Hawaii +4 1/2.

Penn State Nittany Lions
(6-3) +10 at Notre Dame
Fightin’ Irish‘(7-1-1)

It is nice to see PSU on
the skids, dropping three
out of the last four, but we
certainly don’t welcome the
rejuvenated Irish squad,
which got rich against the
Panthers four weeks ago
and has stomped to a com-
bined 186—51 point-total
margin in four straight shel-
lackings. The schedule
favors the Nittany Lions,
who had a week off to pre-
pare for potent Irish stew
ground game.

Tailback Reggie Brooks
has mangled opposing
defenses all season, and the
PSU stop unit has faltered
terribly over the past few
weeks. As dynamic

the field Saturday will
be in blue and white,

McDuffie. A surefire top five‘
pick come April, McDuffie
would be getting major
Heisman hype if he played
fora PR machine like the
Irish.

Forget Qadry Ismail,
David Palmer and even
Kevin Williams. He doesn’t
have a fancy nickname like
Rocket or Missile, but the
silky smooth McDuffie
doesn’t need one. He’s the
most explosive and is the
flat—out best all-around
receiver/return specialist the
nation has seen in years.
Tim Brown and any of the
Ismails can’t dream about
being as productive as 0.].

 

because "on top of theflash,
McDuffie’s hands are soft as
feathers.

The Lions have fared well
in front ofthe golden dome,
taking three of last six meet-
ings here, but might be
lackluster knowing they
already have a Blockbuster
berth clinched. Don’t buy it
though — Joe Pa isn’t look-
ing to become Joe Pathetic.
If anyone owns Lou Holtz’s
soul,‘ it is Joe Pa. With Pitt’s
decline in recent years, the
Irish have become a bitter
rival to PSU, and with this,
the last scheduled meeting
of the series, emotions
could run out of control.
Expect PSU. to come primed
and ready to go down to the

wire with the Irish.»Take 0
