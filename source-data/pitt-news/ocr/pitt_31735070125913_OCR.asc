A participant in a training camp for terrorism response units dons full protective gear. Across the
nation, fears of biochemical warfare have grown as media outlets release reports of anthrax infections.

As fears ofbiochemical terrorism  

CHARLES ORNSTEIN,
Los Angeles Times '

While. it is. difficult to turn anthrax into a weapon
of mass. destruction, it is quite easy to grow the bacte-
ria in a lab and distribute small quantities piecemeal,
even through the mail, experts said Saturday.

I “Growing this organism is no problem,” said
Norman Cheville, dean of Iowa State University’s
School of Veterinary Medicine. “It grows readily. It
grows overnight.” .

Until last week, the threat of anthrax had been

' V couched largely in terms of its use as a weapon of

mass destruction — and how difﬁcult that would be.
But the death of a man in Florida and the infection of
an NBC News employee in New York have shed light
on the ease of using anthrax for individual criminal
acts. * '

> New York officials conﬁrmed Saturday that an
envelope opened by an NBC staff member tested pos-

itive for anthrax.- Another letter sent to a Microsoft

grow, experts work to inform public

ofﬁce in Reno, Nev., also tested positive, Nevada offi-

cials said.

Bioterrorism experts say the use of the U.S. Postal

Service to transmit lethal bacteria is signiﬁcant and ’

should trigger changes in how mail is handled.

“After hundreds of threats and hoaxes in the last
few years, somebody has ﬁnally been able to do it,”
said David Siegrist, director of studies for Countering
Biological Terrorism at the Potomac Institute‘ for
Policy Studies in Virginia. “That has to guide our
judgment going forward on how we treat some of

these threats.”

In the short tenn, Siegrist said, company mail-
room employees should use rubber gloves and be vig-
ilant for suspicious packages with no return addresses,
block lettering and excessive tape. Going forward,
though, he said, the post ofﬁcemust develop and use

new technologies that protect ag

biological agents.

One student remained in

Union after anthrax threat

Senior Staff Writer

. Joshua Taylor continued to work uninterrupted in his ﬁfth

ﬂoor ofﬁce in the W1lliam’Pitt Union Saturday night, even as oth-
ers ﬂed the building after city 91 1’ operators received a phone call
threatening the release of a deadly biological agent there. W

Taylor said that when he ﬁnally left the building at approxi-
mately 9:30 pm. — more than 20 minutes after police received
the first of two anthrax-related threats — he did so only because
he had plans to meet a friend. I

According to Wendy Ignasiak, a Union manager who was on
duty during the evacuation, she and another manager made an
announcement over the building’s intercom system armouncing
the evacuation.

But, Ignasiak said, neither police nor University personnel

T activated the building’s central ﬁre alarm. . *

University spokesman Robert Hill said that rather than trig-
gering the ﬁre alarm, city and Pitt police searched the Union from
“top to bottom.”

Taylor, a Rainbow Alliance officer, said that with a window
open to let fresh air in, he was aware of sirens on the streets below,
but thought little of them. . . ' _

, “Nothing_seemed_ particlrlariy alarming at the time,”_ he said.
“Oakland is a throughway. Sirens"; go off at all hours of the day.”
j According to Taylor, what’he_’didn’t hear was any indication
that police had cleared the building. ' ' '

“No alarm,” Taylor said. “Nothing in" the building. [I had] no
clue what was going on.” ' ' e ~ ,

‘Had the threat been a real one, I would have been affected,”
he said. “Surely there would have been a way to alert everyone to
the fact that something was wrong in a timely fashion.’_’

Ignasiak acknowledged that the intercom might be difficult to
hear from some locations. A . -

“If [people] shuttheir ofﬁce door, they might not be able to
hear,” she said. ‘The intercom is not quite up to par.”

According to the incident report she and the other manager on
duty submitted, Ignasiak saw a police oﬁicer run through the
-building at 9:21 p.m. At that time, she said, the police ofﬁcer told
everyone to evacuate. , .

Ignasiak said that immediately after the ofﬁcer ordered the
evacuation she and other managers made the intercom armounce-
ment to vacate the building and told police officers where they
might locate other students who remained in the building. 7

According to Ignasiak, she and the other manager then left
the building as instructed.

Chris Chergi, manager of the Union, said in the event of a
bomb threat, the Union has traditionally followed the building’s
ﬁre evacuation procedures, which include tiiggering the build-

The Pitt News

Black Action Society crowned
sophomore Adolph Sims and junior
Deshaun Sewell as the first Mr. and
Ms. Black University of Pittsburgh at a
coronation ball held Saturday night at
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association on
Fifth Avenue.

As grand prize winners, the pair
won a trip to Las Vegas, gold watches
and $75 vouchers for the Pitt Book
Center.

The pageant, held two days earlier,
featured the 13 contestants competing

_for the title by showcasing their intel-

lect, talent and leadership qualities.
The event, part of BAS’
Homecoming 2001 Celebration, filled
the Assembly Room of the William Pitt
Union on Thursday night with students
curious to see the eight women and ﬁve
men demonstrate their skills.
According to Kyaien O’Quinn,
BAS vice president, the organization
wants to "host the pageant next year

before homecoming week and then’
sponsor the winners for homecoming 1

king and queen.

“Students will hopefully support
the winner, after they see how much
the candidates [have] gone through,”
O’Quinn said.

Each contestant represented an
African country, wearing a Kinte cloth
sash labeled with his or her respective
nation throughout the night, reﬂective

V of the pageant’s theme of African her-

itage.

Judges scored the participants in
three main categories: interview, talent
and evening wear.

Because of the large number of
contestants, BAS held the interview
portion at an earlier time to cut the
length of the program.

Ms. Egypt, Sewell, received the
first standing ovation of the evening.
Blindfolded and with a white paper
chain cufﬁng her wrists, she entranced
the audience with an original poem
about black society that was inspired
by Spike Lee’s film “Bamboozled.”

A few minutes later, Ms. Chad,
J ordyn White, had the audience on its
feet with her performance of the hit
song “Fallin”’ by Alicia Keys. As the
senior pounded the keys of a grand
piano while singing, the audience
swayed back and forth bellowing the
lyrics with her.

Mr. Zaire, Keon Scott, performed
an original song, while Sims and Mr.
Ethiopia, Nathan James, displayed
their theatrical skills by performing
monologues from a play.

Senior Nkaiso Akpabio used the
three minutes allotted for his perfor-
mance to request that the audience bow
their heads and say “The Lord’s
Prayer” together in a moment of reﬂec-
tion of the attack on Sept. 11. He used
the rest of his time to recite an original
poem, titled “After Eden.” '

The participants demonstrated

' their fashion style in the evening wear

session, modeling clothes donated
from area stores. The women’s styles
ranged from a blue satin ball gown to a
pink sheer dress topped with a denim
jacket. The men wore traditional tuxe-
do attire, including junior Jason Flint’s
coffee—colored plaid suit.

’ Senior Kena Cooper thought this
pageant presented a better format than
the usual BAS talent shows.

“You have to have some brains to
be here,” Cooper said. ‘

After a brief intermissiomremcees
Barry “Bhaav” Wilkins and Joveline
Pettis announced the six finalists. The
finalists — Sewell, Nicole Cofer,

-Rashida Doyle, Sims, James and Scott

— then answered a final question about
the future of black men and women to
help determine the winner.

Wilkins said he hopes the pageant
becomes an annual event for BAS,
leaving something for the students to
look forward to each year.

“The concept was really good and
gives the [black] student body more to
identify with,” he said.

Depression screening raises awareness

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

Millions of students have a
potentially fatal disease and many
don’t even know it. As strange as it
may sound, clinical depression can
go undetected for years.

“You could be
depressed over a long
period of time, like
two years, and you
could just believe that
it’s you,” said Teddy
Fakles, a counselor in
the University
Counseling Center.

The counseling
center participated

moderately

National Depression
Screening Day, a pro-
gram of the World
Health Organization.
Students received
screening forms that asked a series of
short questions about symptoms such
as lack of sleep and energy and “feel—
ings of worthlessness.”

- Students filled out the forms.
Then, the counselors scored the
forms and enumerated the students’
risk factors. Afterward, students had
counseling sessions to talk about the

results.

“This way, they can get some
immediate feedback,” said counsel-
ing center intern Deborah DiLazzaro.
DiLazzaro worked at the screening
table on the lower level of the
William Pitt Union.

Can a screening form tell you if a
person is depressed? Probably not.

“It’s not diagnostic,”
DiLazzaro said. “[The
screening] just puts it
out into their immedi-
ate awareness that this
is a common problem
and that these are
some of the common
side effects.”

Fakles also empha-
sized the importance
of making depressed
students aware that it’s
a clinical disease and
that they need help.
“People very often
think it’s them,” Fakles said. “One of
the symptoms of depression is that
you feel guilty.”

The screenings were an alterna-
tive to going directly to the counsel-
ing center, which some students find
intimidating.

,lClinical depression can lead to
changes in sleep cycles and appetite,
increased restlessness, and loss of
interest and pleasure in activities
ranging from school to sex. It can
also lead to suicide, which is the third

leading cause of death in Americans

age 15 to 24, according’ to the WHO
and the Centers for Disease Control
and. Prevention.

National Depression Screening
Day, an annual event, occurred on the
one-month anniversary of the terror-
ist attacks on the World Trade Center
and Pentagon. Fakles said -that stu-
dents are more at risk for symptoms
of conditions such as depression and
post-traumatic stress disorder.

A “We wanted to be very alert that
it’s happening one month after the
attacks,” Fakles said. “One month is
exactly the amount of time where
symptoms start to show.”

For most people, being on edge

’ and more tense is a perfectly normal ‘

reaction to an infringement on our

national security, Fakles said.
“People who suffer from anxiety

or depression in thefirst place might

reach a point where talking to your-

friends isn’t enough and they really
should talk to a professional about
it,” she said.

County coroner believes Lee
Harvey Oswald didn’t act alone

MARTY FLAHERTY
Staff Writer

According to the ﬁndings of
Allegheny County Coroner Dr. Cyril H.
Wecht, the U.S. government committee
assigned to investigate the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy was
inconsistent with the forensic evidence
of the case.

Wecht is a nationally renowned
forensics expert who was the first foren-
sic pathologist allowed by the Kennedy
family to examine the president’s
remains. .

Wecht’s lecture on the Kennedy
assassination last Wednesday night was
not a conspiracy theory based upon con-
jecture about who had motive, opportu-
nity and means to carry out the assassi-
nation. Rather, it was a methodical, sci-
entific rebuttal of the Warren
Commission’s ﬁndings, which endorsed
the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone in killing President
Kennedy. .

Wecht pointed out was that there
was an 11-degree upward angle from an
entry wound in Kennedy’s back to the

corresponding exit wound in his throat. '

According to Wecht, this angle
would be wholly inconsistent with the
trajectory of a bullet fired from
Oswald’s supposed position on the sixth
ﬂoor of the Texas School Book
Depository unless Kennedy was bent
over_ at the time.

“John Kennedy was not tying his
shoes or scratching his groin  when he
was shot,” Wecht said. “He was doing
what a president in a motorcade should

‘be doing: smiling and waving.”

To illustrate this point, Wecht dis-
played a series of slides, including still
captures from Abraham Zapruder’s film
of the assassination, as well as diagrams
from the original autopsy performed on
Kennedy. He noted that this evidence —
not information gathered on his own —

was the source for his calculations.

He also attacked the “single bullet

theory,” the explanation presented by’

Arlen Specter, now a Pennsylvania sen-
ator. According to this theory, three bul-
lets fired by Oswald could account for
the eight wounds in President Kennedy
and Texas Gov. John Connally, who
rode in the limousine with Kennedy.

Wecht said that the Warren
Commission’s claim that a single gim-
man carried out the assassination
depended on the ability of one of those
three bullets to account for several of
the eight wounds.

Specter’s account of how this might
have happened, as shown in a diagram
that Wecht displayed, required the bullet
to repeatedly change direction and

speed. “Whatever you want, this bullet
readily and happily obliges,” Wecht
said.

Wecht also questioned the quality of
the investigation, and, in particular, the
expertise of the two naval pathologists
assigned to perform the autopsy on
Kennedy.

V He said that these men “could not
recall ever [examining] a gunshot
wound,” and that they had never taken a
single -course’ at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology, which Wecht
described as “the Mecca of pathology in
the entire world.”

The selection of these two men was
illogical, Wecht said, in light of the fact
that a number of civilians, whom Wecht
rated as the top pathologists in the
nation, were within an hour’s transit of
the autopsy site. '

This decision, he said, was likely
due to the fact that a pair of military men
would be likely to answer to what their
superior officers asked of them.

Wecht said that the men performing
the autopsy were told the supposed facts
of the case and that the “whole scenario
was put in place” before the autopsy
began. The result of this, according to
Wecht, was a “retroactive investigation”
that could only serve to support the
given conclusions.

He also said that the rush to con-
clude the issues involved along with the
questionable nature of the investigation
created a cover-up that was not neces-
sarily the act of the guilty covering their
tracks. _

“I think there is a political need to

, quiet these things down to assuage the

anxieties of the people,” he said. J
Wecht did not make any claims

about who might have carried out the,
assassination during his lecture, but '

afterward answered a question to that
effect by saying, “Not Cuba, not
China,” but an “American patriot,”
seeking to eliminate a politician who
could not be removed from ofﬁce by
election. '

A He ‘suggested that the later assassi-
nation of Kennedy’s brother, Robert
Kennedy, was carried out with the same
motive.

Wecht’s lecture was not a ‘stand-
alone event, but part of a ﬁve-week
course called “The J Assassination:
The Continuing Inquiry.”

Wecht is one of several guest speak-
ers featured in the course each semester.

This semester is the third section of
a four-part class, with different informa-
tion discussed in each section.

The .course is offered without credit
by the Center for Lifetime Learning, a
branch of the. College of General
Studies.

Experts analyze potential biological weapons  

Anthrax, page 1

Postal oﬂicials say there’s no way to inspect per-
sonally the hundreds of millions of letters and pack-
ages delivered every day. They urgethe public to be
cautious and to report suspicious activity.

A few milligrams of anthrax, which would not be V

visible to the naked eye, contains millions of anthrax
spores, enough to infect thousands of people if dis-
persed properly, experts said. More than likely, most
people would only be able to produce a small fraction

 of ﬂrat.

“This is what you can do with any germ,” said
Philip Hanna, a professor of A microbiology and
immunology at the University of Michigan. “Anthrax
is just new to the United States’ perspective. What’s
scarier is the intent, not the technologies.

' “Fertilizer isn’t particularly scary, but if you put it

. into a van with gasoline and drive it to .a federal build-

ing, you can blow it up.” That’s what happened in
1995 at the Alfred P. Munah federal building in
Oklahoma City.

-Fortimately, Hanna said, the human body is
somewhat resilient to anthrax, and it takes thousands
of spores to cause infection. “Anthrax is a very ineffi-
cient sort of murder weapon,” he said. “Ifyou send out
thousands of anthrax letters, even if they’re all opened,
very few people are going to contract the disease. For
once with anthrax, nature cuts us a break.”

For instance, in Florida, only one person died of
inhaled anthrax; at least seven others tested positive
for exposure but did not become ill.

Until the n1id—l990s, the government kept few
tabs on who shared and sold samples of anthrax and
other dangerous bacteria. In the rnid-1980s, before the

Persian Gulf War, the not—for—proﬁt biological supply 6'

company American Type Culture Collection sold
three strains of anthrax to Iraq, which reportedly used
the bacteria to create biological weapons.

. Then, in 1995, a laboratory worker at Ohio State
University obtained three vials of bubonic plague
from American Type by falsifying university letter-

head.

The man, Larry Wayne Harris, pleaded guilty to
one count of wire fraud. Harris, a member of the white
supremacist group Aryan Nations, also claimed that he
cultivated anthrax by taking samples from a 20-year-
old burial site for cattle that had died of the disease. \-
' After realizing lax lab controls, Congress passed a
1996 law that severely limits the interstate shipment of
anthrax and other pathogenic strains, such as plague.

Researchers wishing to obtain anthrax today must
ﬁrst receivea license ﬁom the Centers from Disease
Control and Prevention. In addition, shippers must
inform the government when they send an anthrax
sample, and researchers must then acknowledge
receipt.

Labs are not the only place to obtain anthrax,
though. The bacterium can be obtained from contam-
inated animals orﬁom soil near where the animals are
buried, experts Said.

Sophisticated technology is needed to turn rod-
shaped anthrax bacteria into dried, particle-size spores
that could contaminate thousands of people over a
large geographic area. Creating smaller supplies
intended to affect one or two people doesn’t require
any equipment, said anthrax expert Martin Hugh-
Jones of Louisiana State University. »

Anthrax infection can take three forms, depend-
ing on how the spores enter the body. If enough spores
are breathed in, inhaled anthrax will develop and is
nearly always fatal if not treated early. Spores‘ can also
enter the body through a cut in the skin, causing a blis-
ter and large scabbed sore. Finally, a person can devel-
op an anthrax infection if they eat food contaminated
with the bacteria.

Antibiotics, such as Cipro, doxycyclene and peni-
cillin, are effective at treating the infection if used
early. Inhalation anthrax is, the most deadly, while
cutaneous anthrax (through the skin) usually resolves
itself on its own. - ~ ‘

The man who died in Florida had inhalation
anthrax, while an NBC employee in New York devel-
oped the infection through her skin.

ing’s central ﬁre alarm.

Ignasiak said that she did not know why the police did not
make use of the ﬁre alarm — as they later did during the evacua-
tion of some Schenley Quadrangle residencehalls, but speculated
that “maybe everyone left the building too quickly.” ,

Taylor said that when he ﬁnally exited the Union through the
Fifth Avenue entrance, police officers there asked him whether
anyone else remained in the building. To the best of his knowl-
edge there was no one else, Taylor said. 1

According to Taylor, the police didn’t question him about his
presence in the building. Taylor said police only told him onlym-
cm to cross the street where he waited with others before eventu-
ally leaving. - _

Hill said the University has no speciﬁc policy that applies to
terrorist threats, adding that the emergency procedures that gov-
ern ﬁre evacuation are designed to encompass everysituation.

Chergi said since she began working at the University in the
1970s, she has witnessed many evacuations, but acknowledged
the unique nature of an anthrax threat. '

“We’ve had bomb scares before and it was never like this,”
she said.

EDITORIAL

Cooperation, not turf wars,
needed in emergencies

Saturday night, some students sat in
Hillman Library or their rooms, diligently
studying for midterms. Others were out at
bars and restaurants, enjoying the night
with friends. Others were hanging out in
friends’ rooms.

By 9:30 p.m., everybody in the
Union, Hillman, Schenley Quad and
Towers did the same thing: Wandered the
streets of Oakland, fearing a terrorist
attack but not knowing the exact nature of
the threat.

Two hours later, they received the all
clear to return to their previous activities.
But this followed chaos and confusion.

Pitt and city police did the right thing by  

taking the threat seriously. The chaos that
ensued should, we hope, force those
responsible for responding to emergencies
to reevaluate their plans.

The University must equip the Union
with a better intercom system. An ofﬁcer

. from the Rainbow Alliance continued to

work, unaware of what was happening
around him, on the ﬁfth ﬂoor more than
20 minutes after the initial threat. Had the
threat been real, his life would have been
in danger. Police should have activated
fire alarms in all affected buildings, not
only the residence halls.

Diﬁerent agencies —— including Pitt
police, city police, housing, Union man-

agement and library management — need
to better coordinate their efforts and have
on hand an emergency response plan with
a speciﬁc role assigned to each agency.
Possibly the University still has plans
from long ago, which it should use as
examples to make new plans.

Pitt police and city policeare the two
agencies that need to coordinate the most.
While federal and local authorities have a
reputation for poor cooperation, there is
no reason city and college police should.
In an emergency, there is no need for a turf
war.

In the event of another biological
scare, perhaps people would be safer stay-
ing in their rooms. While students in
Hillman and the Union were in immediate
danger, those in the residence halls were
not. In fact, they likelyfound themselves
in more danger when they left their rooms.

When an evacuation is necessary, any
new response plan should include a cen-
tralized place for the evacuees to go.
Saturday night, students found themselves
wandering the streets of Oakland. This
should not happen again.

Never before have we faced the threat
of biological terrorism on campus. It
caught the University off guard. Now it
has happened,‘ and administrators must
find a better way to handle it the next time.

Do you ‘remember when you first
realized your parents were actual people
with their own lives, not people who just
lived to nag you, about homework and

A curfew?

That might sound silly, but it’s easy
to forget that your parents existed before
becoming mom and dad.

A while ago, I made a miraculous
discovery: My mother is not just a person,
but also an intelligent and fascinating per-

discovered that she actually studied many

of the same things that interest me now ’

—— even though she’s a businesswoman
and Fm an English writing major.

And when we talked about the long = '

line of jerks I dated in high school, she
related stories about getting stood up for
dates and finding out her nerdy’ best
friend Chip had a crush on her.

It took me 18 years to realize that,
even though my mom infuriated me in

son completely apart from
her identity as my mom.
When I was in second
grade, I saw my teacher,
Mrs. Wilson, at the grocery
store with .her husband. I

I guess I somehow
thought she just slept under her desk at
night and waited for her students to come
back to class. The idea that she had a life
outside school was incomprehensible.

'It’s the same thing with parents. At
some point, you become adult enough to
realize your parents are adults, too, and
might actually have something to say if
you talk to them.

It wasn’t until my freshman year,
after I moved out of my mom’s house,
that I realized I actually enjoy hanging
out with her. ‘

During that year, my mom and I got
into the habit of occasionally meeting
Downtown near her ofﬁce for coffee or

_ dinner, just to catch up. Dtuing those

brief conversations, It learned many
things about my mom that I had never
known.

‘ When we talked about myclasses, I

talked about going to my boyfriend’s fra-

events at his college fraternity. We talked
about my plans for studying abroad next

share stories about the time he spent in
Germany with the Army. ‘
So the next time your parents call,
you might want to try actually talking to

them instead of trying to end the conver--

Trust in midst of fear brings out true spirit of homecoming

, We are all taught at a very early age
not to talk to strangers. Particularly
ones in cars. Especially when they offer
you a ride somewhere.

But Saturday night, as city and Pitt
police converged on campus to address
an anthrax scare, as students ran out of
the library and their residence halls, as
students current and past
to celebrate
homecoming, the_ rules
were different.

And that is why two
freshmen took a chance on
a ride with my friend and
me — two utter strangers.

We were on our way to
Station - Square for Pitt

  

annon

weren’t even sure how they were going
to get to the cruise — the shuttles sched-
uled to take students to the dock were
stuck at the Union.

Maybe it was camaraderie born of a
shared scary experience or maybe they
just trusted us because we were dressed
up too. Whatever it was, they decided to
join us in our quick Jetta
jaunt to Station Square.

We got acquainted as
we drove. We found out our
backseat companions were
both Towers-dwelling fresh-
men excited about the
prospect ‘ of dancing the
night away — anthrax or not.

As we drove over the

 

Program Council’s annual . Birmingham Bridge and the
homecoming cruise. MCI-aughlln whole Pittsburgh skyline
Waylaid by the police Editor in Chief came into view, I reclaimed
activity, we wondered a funny fuzzy feeling in the

whether the event was still going to-be
held. So naturally, as we drove past a
couple dressed in evening wear, we
stopped to ask their opinion.

While they weren’t sure if the event
had been canceled, the two told us they

Homecoming coverage
inadequate

Hi, my name is Nkemjika
Ofodile. I was crowned the
Homecoming Queen 2001 for Pitt
this past Saturday. Today, which is
Oct. 15, I expected to see a good-
sized article on homecoming, the
court, and the king and queen.
Something elaborate enough to
take 50 copies and mail them to
family and friends. .

But this was not to beso as all
there was was a picture of the back
of my head.-I went into -your
officesand inquired as to why this
was. I was told, by one of your
editors, and I can’t quite remember
her name, that all of you on the
staff felt that homecoming had
been covered quite accurately.

these two freshmen and glad they

accepted our invitation to come to the
cruise with us. They could easily have
bought into the mentality of fear, which
was at that point overtaking our cam-
pus. But they trusted two people.

Looking over at my friend, whom I
had only seen intermittently since his
summer graduation, and brimming with
good Sarnaritanism, I felt sure I had
found the actual meaning of homecom-
ing weekend. It wasn’t the extra shine
on the Union ﬂoors, mounds of posters
advertising candidates for homecoming
royalty ‘or even the posh alumni soirees
happening all over campus to raise
money for the University coffers.

It was the tiny moments like mine —
when you realize your abject happiness
in a place — that constituted a real
homecoming. At that moment, I rekin-
dled my love affair with Pitt — a place
where, even despite terrorist threats, a

couple of freshmen could keep some

faith and I could still enjoy a night of
music and maritime goodness with an
old friend. ’

It was a similar moment the night

before, when watching . white gold
sparks rain down around the Cathedral,
I felt my eyes water. Standing on
Bigelow Boulevard beneath ﬁreworks
and the Cathedral pyrotechnics show,
my impending April graduation became
a reality. And even though I’d been
bemoaning midterrns and assignments
and classes in general, I admitted to
myself that I’ll miss Pitt when it’s time
to leave. And reasons like that will
spring to mind when I ponder whether
to return to Pitt as an alumna for home-
coming next year.

As the four of us got out of the car
and headed off separately, my friend
and I told the freshmen we’d be more
than happy to chauffeur them home as
well. And as we strolled back to the car
later, chilly from peering at the skyline
from the upper deck all night, the fresh-
men found us again.

Editor in Chief Shannon McLaughlin
hopes the anonymous freshmen of her
column enjoyed themselves Saturday
night and someday return the favor by
oﬂering two strangers a ride.

But I as well as many others
beg to differ. You had one article

on Friday, which covered every— -

one, not just the court. -It was a
candidate article. There have been
articles in the past on those who
made homecoming court, so there-
fore, it is not clear to me as to why
not this year.

I feel as though there have
been great accomplishments made
within the minority community
this past weekend, and yet, for
some odd reason, your newspaper
is making its best attempts to sup-
press that information from being
completely released to the public,
or even just those that might not
have known. This is not just an
issue that I have for myself, as I
feel that you putting in the back of
my head was unjust, bu_t there
could have been some type of pic-
ture of Penny in there.

The court could also have had
pictures togetheraas everyone on
the field se.emed to have been
snapping away. One of those pic-
tures had to have come out. The
point is that your newspaper has
taken some of the joy and prestige
out of this event by refusing to put

‘all of the pictures and the articles

that should have been in the news-
paper, and simply settling on what

I guess is your View on how impor-
tant this was: the back of my head.

A tale of
two teams

   

 

Spa-rs Vlnw

Joe Marchilena,

If your boss gave you an ultima-
tum, would you do your best to fulfill
it?

Ivan Hlinka didn’t and it cost him
his job. .

Hlinka’s failure to fulfill manage-
ment’s request to improve his English
over the summer was one of the top
reasons he was fired as Penguins
coach Monday morning. Assistant

coach Rick‘ Kehoe was named to,

replace Hlinka and try to turn around
a 0-4 start.

Hlinka has one of the greatest
hockey minds in the world, leading
the Czech national team to a gold
medal at the 1998 Olympics. The only
problem is that he doesn’t think in
English, which makes it difficult to
communicate with players.

Unfortunately, Hlinka is not the
only reason for the Penguins’ woeful
start. Throw in the loss of the second
greatest player in the world and a
young defense and you’ve got the rea-
son why Pittsburgh is winless after
four games for the first time since the
1983-84 season.

That year, the Penguins won only
16 games and finished dead last.

After a tremendous run in last’

year’s playoffs, big things were
expected from the Penguins, despite

the loss of J arornir J agr. General man- .

ager Craig Patrick re-signed all of the
team’s free agents except for defense-
man Bob Boughner. Young players
like Johan Hedberg and Andrew
Ference looked ready to take their
games to the next level.

Instead, youth and some bad luck
hurt the Penguins. Boughner’s loss,
along with injuries to Janne
Laukkanen and Hans Jonsson, has not

Harris Simplifies offense

BRIAN GOLDMAN

With six games left, Pitt’s football season isn’t
even half over. Yet some members of the media are
already calling this season a failure on the Panthers’
part. These statements could affect the players’ psyche
going into Saturday’s showdown with Boston College.

“Our players don’t read newspapers -because they
don’t have the money or the time,” Harris said. “They

read the Pitt News, and that’s
about it.”' A

At the beginning of the sea-
son some experts predicted Pitt
would be the spoiler in the Big
East conference and would com-
pete with Miami and Virginia
Tech. The expectations dwindled
after Saturday’s loss. Though
hopes of a bowl bid are fading,
Harris is confident that his play-
ers are still positive about the rest
of the season.

“I believe we should be bet-
ter,” Harris said. “But we have
been our own worst enemy.”

Lastweek, the women’s cross
country team ran in the cold and rain
at Lehigh, Pa.

This week in Greenville, S.C.,
the team was at the other extreme.
Not only was it brutally hot at the

Pre-Nationals Meet held on the cam- ‘

pus of Furman University, but the
6,000 meter course they ran was
rated one of the five hardest in the
country. .

It will be the site of the NCAA
Championships at the end of the sea-
son, and most of the teams that were
there this weekend will likely be
back then.

In the faster of the two heats at
the meet, the Pitt women finished
31st, furthering its hope that it will
be one of those teams.

“They competed against the best

Freeman said. “The experience they
got this weekend was really price-

The heat and the course itself
affected the women’s times with one
runner, freshman Lauren Shaffer,

Men’s soccer ties

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Last year’s meeting between the men’s soccer team and the
then No. 2 St. John’s Red Storm resulted in a shocking Panther vic-
tory. The Panthers ﬁnished the season 13-5.

This year’s rematch between the Panthers and the Red. Storm
at Quaker Valley High School was played in a steady rain and ended
in a stunning 1-1 tie.

“If you’re organized and determined then you set yourself up
for the big play,” head coach Joe Luxbacher said. “I’ve expected us
to do well all along.” I

Pitt went into Sunday’s— game 3-7 overall and 0-5 in the‘Big
East, while the Red Storm came in ranked No. 3 in the nation. St.
John’s outplayed the Panthers in the ﬁrst half as they outshot them
1 1-0.

“We’ve been shooting ourselves in the foot, with ejections or
just blunders that would cost us,” he said. “We had a solid elfort
against an undefeated team.”

Red Storm midﬁelder Christopher Wmgert scored on a penal-
ty kick in the 58th minute of the game to give St. John’s a 1-0 lead.

“He [Gaul] probably didn’t have to come out and play the ball
that aggressive,” Luxbacher said. “Justin Gaul played big. He kept
us in the game in the ﬁrst half and we settled down in the second
half.”

Pitt struck back in the 77th minute of the game. Midﬁelder
Bryan Hopper passed the ball to defenseman Clay Haﬂich, who
sent a cross pass to midﬁelder Marco Canizales. Carrizales then put
the ball past Red Storm goalkeeper Guy Hertz. The goal was
Carrizales’s third of the season.

For the game, St. J ohn’s outshot Pitt 24-9. The Panthers round-
ed up 26 fouls, compared to the Red Storrn’s 12.

Panthers’ goalkeeper Justin Gaul had a career game with 15

saves. Eight of Gaul’s saves came in the ﬁrst half. For his eﬂ°ort,'

Gaul was named the Co-Big East goalkeeper of the week
Defensemen Miles Dowiak and Josh Whitham both chipped in

two shots to lead the Panthers. St. J ohn’s Timothy O’Neill led the

Red Storm with ﬁve shots, while midﬁelder Chris Corcoran had

four. ‘ ‘ '
“I’ve been harping on the importance of individual mental
preparation,” Luxbacher said. “We played more of a man—marking
defense, where you either do your job or you come out.” 0

Pitt’s next game is this Saturday as the team travels to

Providence. The Panthers next home game will be Oct. 24 when .
, they go against Robert Monis. The game will be played at Robert’

Morris, but it will be considered a home game for the Panthers.

Season weighing on players and coach

fumbles.

“We’ve been cutting back on
and simplifying our play calls,”
Harris said. “We are going to keep
cutting back until we get it right.”

Turnovers are a problem for Pitt"

this season. They had 10 turnovers
in their last two games combined
regardless of who has the ball or
who throws it.

Antonio Bryant and R.J. English
have been victims of the fumble,
and Rod Rutherford and David
Priestley have combined for eight
interceptions this season, and six in
the past two games. Even Boston
College head coach Tom O’Brien
has noticed Pitt’s lack of retaining
the football.

“Pitt seems to be getting some
good drives on offense,” O’Brien
said. “But they seem to be shooting
themselves in the foot on offense.”

When problems arise on a foot- the Panthers’ only touchdown of the on ESPN regional starting at noon. ’

ball team, there are always those
players who feel that the way to
turn the negatives into positives is
to put more pressure on them to
help the team win. The Panthers are
no different than any other college
football team. Each Pitt player has
the burden of four straight losses on
their backs and has puts a lot of
pressure‘ on himself. According to
Harris, this can sometimes be a
problem.

“Some players are trying too
hard,” Harris said. “Antonio is an
intense competitor and when he
can’t do what he wants, he gets
frustrated. Our quarterbacks are
also putting way too much pressure
on themselves.”

In every game this season, both
Rutherford and Priestley have
switched back and forth at quarter-
back. On Saturday, Priestley was on
the field for the first three drives,
with Rutherford entering the game
in a short yardage situation to score

game. A I ’
Late in the second quarter, Pit

forced a Syracuse fumble on the
Orangemen’s own five-yard line.
The Panthers recovered the ball, but
in a short yardage, first down and
five situation, Harris decided to use
Priestley instead of Rutherford,
sparking some controversy. When

.asked Monday if the quarterback

situation would change Saturday at
Boston College, Harris answer with

.an emphatic, 5‘Nope.”

Last year the Panthers bl-ew
away Boston College in Three
Rivers Stadium winning 42-26. Pitt
running back Kevan Barlow had
209 yards running, while quarter-
back John Turman threw for 332
yards in the air, and five touchdown

1 passes. Over 220 of those yards and

two of the touchdowns were on
throws to Bryant.

This year, the Panthers head to
Boston 1-4, while the Eagles enter
at 5-2. The game will be televised

helped either. lgleither of their replace- ‘

ments, Josef £,?Melichar, nor Michal
Rosival, hasplayed a full season in
the NHL.

Hedberg has already lost three
times as many games this season as he
did last year. In his threelosses, he
gave up an average of 3.66 goals and
stopped only 85 percent of the shots
he faced.

It doesn’t help that Hedberg hasn’-t
had any assistance from the other end.

The Penguins, who were second in
the league in goals last season, have
scored just seven goals so far this

year. Martin Straka leads the team -

with three goals. Mario Lemieux and
Alexei Kovalev have yet to score. The
power play, which is supposed to be

"one of their.strengths, is 0-for—19 this

season.

The biggest problem has been try-
ing to replace J agr. Patrick was able to
acquire Washington’s top three
prospects in exchange for the five
time scoringchampion, but only one

’ of them, Kris Beech, made the team.

All three of those players may
someday help the Penguins win the
Stanley Cup, but none of them can be
the offensive force this year that J agr
had been for the last decade. .

.While the Penguins have disap-
pointed so far this year,_ another
Pittsburgh team has proved the pre-

. season predictions wrong. To the sur-

prise of many, the Steelers busted out
of the gates to a 3-1 record and sole
possession of first place in the AFC
Central division.

Their passing game may not be

Steelers face reality check

equivalent to that of the St. Louis
Rams, but for the past three weeks, it

has been enough.

With the group of running backs

the Steelers have, why do they ever

need to throw the ball. ,

They can pound the ball with
Jerome Bettis, who had his third 100-
yard game of the season in Sunday’s
20-17 win in Kansas City. They can
also run outside with Amos Zereoue.

Or they can really change things
up and let Kordell Stewart run the
ball. So what if he has‘trouble hitting
an open receiver in the end zone. Let
him do what he does best —— run the
football.

Of course, it also helps to have a
defense that has given up an AFC-low
12 points a game and ranks third'over—
all in the NFL. It really helps when
that defense has scored almost as

. many touchdowns as the offense has.

' The Steelers are not quite at the
same level as the Rams or Baltimore
Ravens yet. Next week’s game against
Tampa Bay should give coach Bill
Cowher an idea of where his teams
stands.

Pittsburgh’s offense is second in
the league in rushing. That statistic
could be deceptive, considering that
none of the Steelers’ first four oppo-
nents is ranked higher than 25th in run
defense. . _

Tampa Bay is ranked third.

If the offense can find a way to

‘move the ball against the Buccaneers,

this year, the Steelers might prove
everyone wrong.

Pitt News.

Sophomore Mike Diano‘ was
the first Panther to finish the five-
mile course for Pitt, coming in
10th with a time of 26:53.

“I think Mike has got a lot
more in him,” Freeman said.

Freshman Darrell Curtis, who
has been the top runner for the
men the’ past couple of meets, fin-
ished 18th. _.

Sophomore Dan Hull finished
one second and a place later.
Freshman Nick Westerman kept
Pitt’s top four tight, by finishing
21 seconds later than Diano with a

time of 27:14.

The time was good for 22nd
and fellow freshman J eryl Wilborn
took 32nd with a time of 27:49.

With the Big East
Championships just around the
corner, Freeman still thinks the
menhave some work to do.

where we really have to start
