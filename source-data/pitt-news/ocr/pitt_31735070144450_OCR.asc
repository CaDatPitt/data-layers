EPA: Pittsburgh misses ozone mark

by Caitlyn Christensen
Staﬂ Wrt'ter

The Environmental Protec-
tion Agency announced that be-
cause the Pittsburgh area has not
met federal health standards for
ozone, it might reclassify the area,
placing limits on new industries
and road building within the city
limits.

The EPA measures an area’s
ozone value based on a three-year
time period, said Christopher

Cripps, an environmental engi-
neer for the EPA. Pittsburgh’s
reading for 2005-2007, of 87 parts
per billion, didn’t meet the federal
standard set in 1997, which is 80
parts per billion.

If Pittsburgh’s ozone level
doesn’t I improve, the EPA will
reclassify the area, which recently
became “moderate ' non—attain-
ment,” to “serious non-attain-
ment” in 2010. _ ’

“OMG!” “Gross!” “Sweet!”

Echoes of awe, disapproval
and praise resonated throughout
Posvar Hall Friday night at Pitt’s
Obscure Movie Group’s showing
of “Throne of Blood,” directed
by Japanese ﬁlmmaker Akira Ku-
rosawa. '

“Throne of Blood,” a rendi-
tion of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,”

“They actually shot real arrows
at the actors so that they could
show REAL fear. If you think
that this is your run-of-the-mill
regicide, you are.mistaken,”~ said
group president Dan Wolf in a
newsletter. .

The group offers a new movie

without any cover charge. Meet-

ings take place every Friday night 7

in Posvar Hall beginning at 8 p.m.,

although the movie normally starts _

shortly after, as everyone gets situ-

ated. The movie brings in between

20   members each week.
“Joining the club is as easy as

showing up for a meeting and get-
ting on our e-mailing list,” said
Vi/olf, who majors in biology and
business.

Wolf said his father owned a
movie store, so he was exposed to
different kinds of films, directors
and actors while growing up.

The group alternates between
genres, attempting to avoid show-
ing two action movies or two
horror movies consecutively and
makes an effort to balance watch-
ability with obscurity, said W/olf.

“I guess we are talking about
relative obscurity. We aten’t try-
ing to get. anything too radical
like ‘The Wedding Trough,’ but
we don’t have a problem show-
ing an extreme movie either,” said
sophomore Eoin Koepﬁnger, vice
president of the group.

Wolf admits that Koepﬁnger,
a film studies major, has a better

knowledge of obscurity If a film ,

possesses questionable content,
e-mails are forwarded to all group
members before the showing.

Skeleton of V Cadavra,” “Battle

Boat moves by surface tension

by Alie Gensheimer
Staﬂ Wrder

Pitt researchers have designed
a boat that moves the same way
insects skate‘ on water and oper-
ates without the use of sails, mo-

. tor or paddles.

The developments might
eventually be used in robots and
microsurgery. '

Inspiration for the boat came

to Sung Kwon‘ Cho, Pitt senior »

researcher and professor of me-
chanical engineering and materi-
als science, after he read research
conducted at MIT on the aquatic
motion of Pyrrhalta beetle lar-
vae.

Dr. David Hu was part of the
team studying the beetles. He said
that the researchers watched how

the insects landed and moved on
water surfaces.

Sang Kug Chung, a Pitt en-
gineering doctoral student who
assisted with the project, elabo-
rated.

_ “The larva is a very poor
swimmer usually, but as he swims
he bends his back, changing the
surface tension from front to

rear,” said Chung.

expenses. The four units include the
Office of the Provost, the Office of
the Budget and Controller, the senior
vice chancellor of health sciences and
the executive vice chancellor, who

deals with investments and facilities’

“Everyone was given a target
number and asked to ﬁnd ways to
meet that target,” said Clark. “[The
chancellor] pushed implementation

Nordenberg suggested, and the
Board of Trustees approved, a salary

members make up the majority of ﬁlms
viewed.

The Obscure Movie Group members
use Netﬂix to rent the movies that they
don’t already own, said Wolf.

The club began in the fall of 2006 after
seniors Shanna Murphy and Matt Carrick,
the club’s co—founders, got the idea while
riding a bus home after swing dancing one
night.

The name came soon after, but the ab-
breviation, OMG, was no mere accident.

“We tossed around names like the ‘Off-
beat Movie Group, the Offbeat Film Society
[and] the Obscure Movie Club, and then we
realized if we use the Obscure Movie Group
it could be ‘OMGl”’ said Carrick.

In the past, OMG has held a Zombie
Walk and made T—shirts for its members. It
picks a group member to dress up as a robot
at the Activities Fair each fall.

“To be honest, I think this is just some-
thing that people want. People like having
that one movie to talk about that nobody
else knows about,” said Carrick. “We al-
ways get members suggesting movies, and
it’s great because they find these-awesome,
weird, obscure movies to share with other

people.”

Group member Aaron Crandall, a gradu-
ate student, said he agrees with Carrick.

“An interesting point about the Value of
this group: Have you ever heard of ‘UHF?”’
asked Crandall. “It’s a movie written by
Weird Al Yankovic. When Orion Pictures
placed it in front of test audiences it rated
better than [almost] anything that they had
ever made.”

Crandall continued, “The reason you
have never heard of it is because among the A
things that opened that weekend were ‘Le-
thal Weapon 2,’ ‘Batman’ and ‘Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade.’ It just got completely 
buried, and no one has really heard of it be-
cause of that timing.’.’

Both Wolf and Koepﬁnger are new to
their roles. They took the positions after
Carrick and Murphy, who will graduate in
the spring, both resigned last semester.

“I’d like to see the group ﬂourish and
prosper. The best way to do that is to take
matters into your own hands,” said Wolf

Wolf plans to collaborate with other
groups on campus.

Because the group shows a wide range
of movies, they can invite various special-
interest groups to showings that they might
enjoy.

tries ﬁled petitions against it.

After two years in the court of appeals,
the litigation went to the Supreme Court
of the United States in 1999, and the stan-
dard was approved in 2001. However, it
wasn’t implemented until April 2004 be-
cause the question arose of how the EPA
would implement the standard.

Because of this, Cripps said that “if an
area meets the 1997 standard right now, it
isn’t that bad because the standard wasn’t
implemented until ﬁve years ago  but
Pittsburgh still isn’t even close.”

Because of the EPA’s stricter ozone
standard set in May 2008, which is 74 parts
per billion, Pittsburgh is now further from
reaching these guidelines. “It doesn’t seem
likely that Pittsburgh will obtain the new
standard by 2010,” said Cripps. “In fact, it
seems nearly impossible.”

The new EPA standard is based on A

“public health and welfare with ample mar-
gin of safety,” said Cripps. _
It is unknown if the current levels are

January 27, 2009

safe until the long—term effects are seen, he
said, but for now the EPA has set a stan-
dard based on current research.

Cripps said the EPA analyzed how long
it might take the area to meet the current
standards, and it came up with the year
2020, “but Pittsburgh could possibly ob-
tain the standard sooner depending on
how we choose to classify it.” i

To meet the 2008 standard the state
of Pennsylvania must first create a plan
to meet the -V1997 standard and work from
there. Also, the state has already set its own
rules regarding car and truck emissions,
and also implemented more thorough
vehicle—inspection programs. Cripps said,
“The immediate impacts aren’t as big be-
cause they’ve already been done.”

Group Against Smog and Pollution, men-
tioned local efforts such as Allegheny Plac-
es, which develops comprehensive plans

Surrounding areas may

contribute to ozone levels

Ozone, page 4

Pittsburgh meet the new ozone standard.

“We need to rely more on federal regu-
lations to make this happen than on local
efforts,” said Osborne. “Ozone is the type
of gas that is so widespread that it cov-
ers the entire northeast region; Therefore,
we can try to reduce it in our area, but we
can’t stop it from blowing in from other
places.” 1

Dan Volz, a researcher in Pitt’s Gradu-
ate School of Public Health, agreed that
the area’s ozone levels have a lot to do with
the surrounding areas and the region’s to-
pography.

One of the problems is that Pittsburgh
is in avalley, which makes it hard for chem-
icals to leave our area, he said.

Volz also said that the ozone level in
our area is a product of the old coal-ﬁre
plants along the Ohio and Allegheny rivers

that emit chemicals. The winds carry the

problem east and toward Pittsburgh.

High ozone levels aren’t “totally a prob-
lem of our own making,” said Volz, be-
cause many of these plants are located as
far as Ohio, out of Pennsylvania govern-
ment jurisdiction.

Students, along with experts and pro-
fessionals, share in the concern that Pitts-
burgh will again be reclassified in 2010 if it
doesn’t improve its ozone levels.

Osborne agreed. “The fact that we still
haven’t met a standard that is obsolete is a
bit worrisome,” he said.

However, Osborne noted that ozone
levels are often out of human control, as
much of it is based on temperatures in
the summer. A lot of what will happen
in 2010 is based on what the weather in
the summer is like, he said. “If we have a
good summer, we can probably just meet
the standard.”

Smog levels often elevate in the sum-
mer when the sun is strong and tempera-
tures are high. The‘ sunlight reacts with

‘ ground-level pollutants and generates high

ozone levels.

Cripps also said the summer tempera-
tures will be the major determining factor
in whether Pittsburgh is reclassiﬁed.

Summer weather aside, Pittsburgh might
qualify for a one- or two-year extension to

. meet the current ozone standards based on

its improvements, which the EPA will look
at in March 2009, according to Cripps.
Every three years, the EPA takes a read-
ing of an area’s ozone‘ level, and based
upon this reading, the area is classiﬁed as
“attainment,” “non—attainment,” “moder—

ate non—attainment” or “serious non—at-
tainment.” Areas are classiﬁed depending
on how far they are from meeting the air
quality standard.

“The state needs a real implementation
plan,” said Osborne, “not just a county
planning committee, which gives friendly
suggestions instead of setting rules.”

.. Bike rack bill helps

Pittsburgh be cycle-friendly

Bicycles are fast becoming
one of the most popular means
of personal transportation. Low
costs and health beneﬁts spur
many short-distance commuters
to bike rather than take the bus
or drive, but one problem with
cycling is the lack of adequate
bike racks and storage in many
parts of Pittsburgh.

But that problem could be

"solved if new legislation pro-
posed by Mayor Luke Ravenstahl "

is passed by the Pittsburgh City
Council. , .

The bill would allow private
businesses to construct their
own bike racks after paying a $25
fee to the city and _a review of
the plans by the City Planning
Department. In a press release
Ravenstahl said, “It’s important
that we show residents and our
bicycle community that we are
serious about Pittsburgh’s role as
a bike—friendly and green city.”

Overall, the proposed legisla-
tion seems like an extremely pos-
itive step for the city. Not only
would allowing private business-
es to easily construct their own
racks make parking a bike easier,
it could also encourage more
people to bike rather than drive.

The city is already putting up
an additional 100 racks as part
of the neighborhood business
district initiative, and allowing
businesses to construct their
own racks would allow them to
place racks in close proximity to
their entrances, rather than sev-
eral blocks away.

Nonetheless, there are a few
aspects of the proposed legisla-
tion that warrant some scrutiny.
For instance, the bill stipulates

that the racksimust conform to
city standards and leave at least
ﬁve feet of unobstructed side-
walk-space.

While it’s good that the bill
ensures sidewalks remain naviga-
ble, it could prevent store owners
with businesses on narrow side-
walks from constructing racks at
all, or at least severely limit the
number or types of racks they
could construct.

Also, the $25 fee, while not
overly expensive, is at least a lit-
tle punitive. One way to justify it
could be to take the money col-
lected and use it in other bike-
related projects such as painting
bike lanes or constructing city-
owned racks.

Despite these minor issues,

the bill as it stands is deﬁnitely
a step in the right direction for
Pittsburgh. The city already has a
reputation of being highly livable
and environmentally conscious,
a difficult. image to achieve after
decades as a smoky industrial
town.

A growing number of green
buildings -——- including the David
L. Lawrence Convention Cen-
ter, the largest green building in
the world — and an increasing
amount of green initiatives are
changing Pittsburgh into an en-
vironmental capital. Support for

green technology, even some-,

thing as simple as bicycles, is cru-
cial to maintaining that image.

The beneﬁts of cycling, both
in terms of health and the en-
vironment, are well known and
reported. It is comforting to see
Pittsburgh embracing bike cul-
ture and allowing private busi-
nesses to do the same.

Politics makes for good gossip

    

by Molly Green
Cola/nmitt

I I love political gossip. It’s kind of I

like celebrity gossip, except bet-
ter, because with celebrities you
pretty much expect the pre-teen
antics, the drug problems and
ripped leggings.

But politicians? These are peo-
ple who walk around in Armani
powersuits, answering phone calls
about stipulation 23.d of some
bill on public zoos. \While I don’t

‘doubt that it goes on —- oh, how
I’m sure it goes on — politicians,
ever mindful of public image, are
just extremely good at hiding the
smack-talking, the rumor-mon-
gering and overall bitch-slapping
of the political sphere.

Therefore, it’s three times as
gratifying to get a whiff of politi-
cians in their natural state.

\With this in mind, I have to
say I was especially tickled by last
week’s events surrounding the
Search to ﬁll Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton’s senatorial posi-
tion. This played out like a Feb-
ruary sweeps episode of “Gossip

Git .”

At one end we have Gov. Da-
vid Paterson, who’s basically that
kid who wants everyone to like
him. Paterson was sworn in as
governor of New York after the
former governor, Eliot Spitzer,
was accused of servicing pros-
titutes and generally just being a
creep. Paterson is a kind of des-
perate sort, eager for attention.

So you can imagine his delight

.when he was given the task of

choosing Clinton’s replacement.
All of a sudden, everyone wanted
to talk to him. Even Katie Couric
wanted an interview!

So Paterson, eager to per-
petuate his newfound fame, did
the most counterintuitive thing
possible. Instead of choosing a
replacement expediently and dip-
lomatically, he declared that he
could not ﬁll the seat until Clin-
ton was ofﬁcially sworn in as sec-
retary of state.

Thanks to Paterson’s media-
whoring, nearly 10 possible candi-
dates came out of the woodwork
and announced their interest in
the position.

Of these, none was more sur-
prising tthan Caroline Kennedy, a

notoriously private person who,
until recently, wanted absolutely
nothing to do with the public do-
main. O

Despite her lack of experi-
ence, Kennedy became an instant
front—runner, because, well, she’s
a Kennedy. As the day of Clin-
ton’s appointment neared, people
became increasingly convinced
that Kennedy had the position
locked up.

That is, of course, until the
events of Wednesday, Jan. 21,
which is when things get good.

Seemingly out of nowhere, the
New York Post broke this shock-
ing story: According to an anony-
mous source, Kennedy withdrew
her name from consideration.

Then the media circus began.
Soon after both" the Post and

The New York Times reported A

that Kennedy had withdrawn,
both citing anonymous sources,
NBC announced that according

to sources close to the Kennedys

-——- also anonymous, of course —
Kennedy had not withdrawn, cit-
ing a miscommunication between
Paterson and Kennedy.

For the next several hours,
no one, probably not even Pa-

terson, knew exactly what was
going on. Finally, at midnight, to
end the most confusing round of

A he-said-she-said-Caroline—Ken-

nedy—wants—to-be—a-senator—and-

then-doesn’t—and—then—does—and—

then-doesn’t—again ever, Kennedy
announced in an official state-
ment that she had withdrawn her
name for “personal reasons.”

Oh the mystery! The drama!
Who was that first anonymous
source — someone on Kennedy’s
end, or Paterson’s? What hap-
pened during those silent hours
of deliberation before Kennedy
announced her decision? When
did Kennedy actually first with-
draw? Did Paterson ever ‘plan
on picking Kennedy in the first
place? Most beguiling of all, what
were Kennedy’s “personal rea-
sons” for dropping /out?

Paterson’s anonymous sources
came out swinging the next day
with their own answers, insinu-
ating that Kennedy dropped out
because of problems relating to a
nanny, unpaid taxes and possible
marital troubles.

Kennedy’s sources, miffed by

-these reports, charged the gover-
nor with mudslinging. According
to an Associated Press report,

learning that Paterson had also
given a BFF friendship bracelet
to Andrew Cuomo!

“BFF means best friends for-

ever,” said the source. “Caroline
takes that title very seriously, but
apparently Gov. Paterson does
not.”
As for where all these “anony—
mous” sources come from, that’s
a great question. I suspect that
probably at least half of the
sources on Paterson’s end were
actually Paterson himself.

I can see him now, twisting
the phone wire anxiously around
his ﬁnger and speaking in a way-
too—high—pitched voice, so as to
“hide” his true identity:

“Hello? Am I speaking with
the New York Post?  Hi, this is
a close, personal friend of Gov.
Paterson  Yes, I think you could
say I know him pretty well *giggle
giggle*  Yeah, I’m just calling to
inform you that Gov. Paterson
wasn’t ever even considering that
two-tirning, last-minute-decision-
changing jerk Caroline Kennedy

Partisans

by Mason Herron

Cola/n/ziatt

The promises of bipartisanship
are enticing. Barack Obama’s candi-
dacy promised a post—partisan, post-
ideologcal United States If we were
to believe the myths propagated by
the more credulous block of his sup-
porters, it would seem that with a
snap of the  the heavens would
open while luminous rays descended,
snufﬁng partisan pestilence ﬁom the
hallowed corridors of our Capitol.

The notion that this country
might find the most effective solu-
tions to its most debilitating problems
with support from all sides is illusory.
The unfortunate myth of this era is
one which promotes compromise as
a panacea.

Virtues of partisanship are found
in the vision of the Founding Fathers.
Free speech, by design, is inalienably
granted not only for its moral neces-
sity, but also through a belief that un-
abridged, unsuppressed speech was
the best means to create progress in
society. In “On Liberty,” John Stuart
Mill elucidated, "Ihe peculiar evil of
silencing the expression of an opin-
ion is, that it is robbing the human
race; posterity as well as the existing
generation; those who dissent from
the opinion, still more than those
who hold it.”

Bipardsanship and bipartisan leg-

islation silences the minority opinion

of political compromise.
Compromise «squeezes out pe-
ripheral viewpoints The public often
cries out for the emergence of third
parties and alternative choices Bipar-
tisanship merely silences any 
minorities while strengthening the
two—party system as the center swells
Efforts labeled as bipartisan dur-
ing their creation often  harsh
disapproval. The immediate biparti-
san triumphs eventually dissolve into
allegations of unaccountability and
hollowinquisition. The invasion of
Iraq, the Military Cornmissions Act,
the Patriot Act, No Child Left Behind

The notion that this
country might find the

most effective solutions
to its most debilitating
problems with support
from all sides is illusory.

and the FISA amendments are all ‘

tabbed as bipartisan efforts, and all are
deemed to be scourges of the last de-
cade. On the other hand, the Emanci-
pation Proclamation and Civil Rights
Act were divisive yet critical

Most Americans see gridlock in
our Congress as stubbornness Each
side is characterized as  to

hip isn't a bad thing

rect

Bipartisanship is also falsely
equated with expeditiousness The
assumption is that if done without
partisanship, problems may be solved
quickly and efficiently. This quick
process, however, foregoes neces-
sary debate. For example, there are
numerous clarnors for a solution to
health care. —

The belief that health care can be
ﬁxed by the government is a partisan
viewpoint Many feel government
cannot or should not provide a so-
lution. Bipartisanship in solving the
health care crisis through government
would stifle the-latter viewpoint.

Nonetheless, slanderous and ad

  hominem squabbling should be erad-

icated It does not add to the public
discourse, and it is destructive rather
than productive There are opportu-
nities for personal attacks, but only if
done substantially Politicians should
not let personal grudges interfere
with the public forum.
Ourgoal,andthegoalofour
representatives, should be to listen
to all sides, consider all opinions, and
question all assertions These prac-
tices, once implemented, may ap-

However, a much greater purpose is

Seeing Jazz: A Tribute to the
Masters and Pittsburgh Jazz
Legends

Manchester Craftsmen's Guild
1815 Metropolitan Street
Through April 3
419-329-1773

Percussion and painting might
be more similar than most would
expect.

Beginning this week, Man-
chester Craftsmen’s Guild (MCG)
presents “Seeing Jazz: A Tribute
to the Masters and Pittsburgh jazz
Legends.” The exhibition displays
subtle parallels between music and
other art media.

MCG was founded in 1968 by
Bill Strickland, a Pittsburgh native
looking to start an art program to
help minority students in the area.

Renee ~ Govanucci, associate

producer at MCG, said that the
“nonprofit arts and learning cen-
ter’s mission is to educate and in-
spire inner-city youth and preserve,
present and promote jazz and vi-

 

sual arts to stimulate intercultural
understanding.”

Through a blend of art classes
at the center, ranging from ceram-
ics to digital arts, and an integrated
arts curriculum at local schools,
the MCG Youth program impacts
more than 3,000 students per
week, explained Govanucci. Stu-
dents, mostly in middle and high
school, can attend classes tuition-
free.

The MCG]azz division puts on
concerts throughout the year and
organizes classes with musicians.

“Seeing Jazz” will likely be just
as Valuable to attendees.

“The goal of the exhibit is to
provoke awareness of crossover
between jazz music and visual
arts. It’s an educational experience
that’s beneficial for all age groups.
A lot of people can relate to it,”
said Heather Powell, MCG’s coor-
dinator of exhibitions and visiting
artists.

Pittsburgh native Gwendolyn
Black collaborated with MCG to
curate and produce the exhibi-

music.

tion. Powell explained that Black
worked on the show for 10 years in
New York City before approach-
ing MCG about hosting.

“We happen to be in an ideal

situation here at MCG since we

have both parts [art and jazz] un-
der one roof,” said Powell. Black
hopes that this will be the start of
“Seeingjazz” as a traveling exhibi-
tion.

“There’s such a deep history of
jazz in Pittsburgh. This exhibit will
get people to talk about that his-
tory. I think that’s something she
kept at the forefront of her mind,”
said Powell.

The gallery will showcase a
wide range of forms, including
ceramics, sculpture, paintings and
photographs. The exhibit features
both nationally known artists with
works on loan from various loca-
tions as well as local artists.

One such local artist is Tina
Brewer, who works in_a less tradi-
tional medium — quilts.

Brewer uses a‘ unique collage
technique to create story quilts.

“I started 30 years ago. Iwas an
interior decorator and had all these

scraps, so I decided to explore quilt
making. I didn’t like the traditional
process, so I tried the collage tech-
nique,” said Brewer.

Her fabrics come from a diz-
zying array of sources — every-
where from Ghana to local artists
who hand—dye fabric.

“Sometimes I use mementos
from the past —- a handkerchief
or skirt — as a backdrop. Then I
superimpose shapes on top with
transparent fabrics,” she said.

Brewer explained her relation-
ship between jazz music and art:
“I’m inﬂuenced by many art forms
—— poetry, music, dance. The im-
provisation in jazz is how I con-
struct my quilts. Each quilt is like
a dance.”

“Music, if you listen to it long.

and hard, you see visions,” con-
tinued Brewer. “But you have to
really focus. You have to become
immersed in the sound, the voices,
the words.”

Brewer started quilting after
learning about African history and
how it’s interpreted in the United
States.

V She recalled  to her-

self, “I’m 35 years old, and I’m
just starting to learn about African
history, I need to teach it to other
people. So I’ll use my quilts as a
teaching tool.”

Brewer, a member of the Penn-
sylvania Council of the Arts, also
teaches students the quilting trade
and has worked with MCG’s after
school program.

“They’ve been a major sup-
porter of me. They have given me
a platform. They gave me a one-
person show in the ‘90s, so'I’m al-
ways willing to help out at MCG.”

Those who would like a closer
look at how jazz and art intertwine
can attend the Feb. 5 artist recep-

. tion. Free of charge, from 6:15 to

8:45 p.m., visitors can enjoy dem-
onstrations, food and a concert.
Author of Pittsburgh Jazz, John
Brewer will have a book__ signing
and MCG’s honored 2008 Pitts-
burgh jazz Legends (including
Roger Humphries and Joe Negri)
will perform.

“This is a chance to mingle
with the artists, learn how they cre-
ate their work and use jazz as their
medium,” said Govanucci.

Reel Talk with Tom

Second coming of ‘Knight’ is unnecessary at best

by Tom VanBuren
Sembr Staﬂ W/rite/'

 

Advertising is a funny thing, es-
pecially when you’re  to con-
vince people to see a movie that’s
sold more than 53 million tickets.
But that hasn’t stopped Warner
Bros. from promoting “The Dark
Knight,” back in theaters as of last
weekend to remind Oscar voters
that it exists. ‘

How do you convince people
to pay $10.50 to see a movie they
already own? A poster outside the
Pittsburgh Mills IMAX theater ad-
vertises the movie as “The way it
was MEANT to be seen.” Imag-
ine! A movie meant to be seen
in the theater. This is an unusual
concept indeed, but I’ll trust their
artistic vision.

Now let’s be fair.

“The Dark Knight” did, af-
ter all, feature several scenes shot
specially in IIVIAX format, en-
hancing the theatrical experience
over, say, watching it on an iPod.

 

But if you’ve seen the movie since
its DVD release —— and based on
the sales numbers, you did — you
know that while it’s meant to be
seen in the theater, it doesn’t have
to be. .

Not every movie is so lucky
— just look at “Beowulf.” From
behind a pair of heavy—duty 3-D
glasses —— straight from the Willy
Wonka school of optical fashion
— this computer-animated adven-
ture is exciting and irnmersive.

Without the fancy spectacles,

though, the movie isn’t even a fan-

cy spectacle. It’s just a violent, sexy
version of “Shrek.” Without the
novel illusion that Anthony,Hop-
kins is throwing coins at you, or
that Ray Winstone’s genitals might
slap‘ you across the face, the mov-
ie’s contrivances show through.

In late autumn 2007, Beowulf
begged his men to remember
him “not as a king or a hero, but
a man, fallible and ﬂawed.” Sure,
Beowulf, you’re justa regular Joe,
running/ around ﬁghting dragons
and boning an Angelina Jolie de-
mon. In 2009, one can easily see

how ﬂawed “Beowulf” really is,

p Music by

Bach, Brian Eno
and The Beach Boys

and it isn’t because of the time
that has elapsed. It’s because you
can no longer see it the way it was
meant to be seen. The content of
the movie isn’t half as interesting
as the theatrical execution meant
to distract you from its own blah-
ness.

 s’?

Advertising is a"-ﬁ1'nny
thing, especially
when you're trying
to convince people to

see a movie that's sold-

0 well over 53 million
tickets.

“W

This makes me wonder why
Warner Bros. went this route with
“The Dark Knight” re-release
marketing campaign.

Telling my wife that “this is

the way it was meant to be seen”
won’t convince her to ﬁnally see
the movie with me. If that’s what
the studio wanted, the marketing

slogan would be “Now with 100 '

percent more naked Chtistian Bale
rushes.” And with the new wide
releases of many arthouse Oscar
nominees, this seems a bit ill-timed.

Since last week’s Oscar nominee
announcement, the academy has
been a popular target, accused of
shunning mainstream movie—goers
and blockbusters by nominating
lesser-seen ﬁlms like ‘The Reader”
and ‘_‘Frost/ Nixon.” While artistic
integrity is a natural inﬂuence on
the voting, the academy has its
mind on its money, too.

“The Dark Knight” is the sec-
ond-highest grossing movie of all
time — it’s made ‘enough money
for every person in New York City
to see it about six times. Its time
has come and gone. By nominat-
ing other deserving movies,' the
academy might ﬁnally convince
people to go see them.

Unfortunately, there are any
number of great movies out there
— some even (gasp) better than

“The Dark Knight” —— that a1jen’t
being seen. “Slumdog Millionaire”
made less this weekend than both
“Hotel. for Dogs” and the third
‘fUnderwor1d” movie.
Should you see “Dark Knight”
over “Slumdog” simply because of
some veiled threat that you might
miss this one last chance to see it
as it was truly meant to be seen?
That you’ll one day confess to
your grandchildren that, no, you
didn’t see ‘The Dark Knight” in
the theater? That you’ll spend your
nights tightly clutching your Blu-

ray copy and weeping over long- _

lost opportunity?

Please. If that were your best
argument, you’d be seeing “My
Bloody Valentine” before 
else — at least that’s in 3-D. Go
see “Slumdog Millionaire” and en-

courage Hollywood to make more

movies like it.

It’s in theaters, so I can only as-
sume that’s how it was meant to be
seen. _

You’ve already proven how
much you love “The Dark Knight,”
and you can always watch it when
you get home.

Gran Turino

Starring Clint Eastwood
Directed by Clint Eastwood
Warner Bros. Studios

When watching a Clint
Eastwood movie, it’s

hard not to notice‘
how the character
being portrayed
by Eastwood isn’t
the character any-
more, but just Clint
Eastwood’s ﬁlm persona.

In most of his ﬁlms, Eastwood is a tough,
fearless, “don’t mess with me or I’ll blow
your head off” kind of guy. So if you ask
someone, “What was the trainers name in
‘Million Dollar Baby?” The answer is Clint
Eastwood. The old cowboy in “Unforgiv-
en”? Clint Eastwood. Even when watching
his earlier ﬁlms, you don’t remember the ’
names. ”Clint Eastwood, the Bad and the
Ugly/’? ,

In “Gran Torino,” after seeing a young
girl’s beaten, bruised and bloodied face, Clint‘
Eastwood’s character goes to his home and
sheds a tear. While many would think, “Oh
jeez, give me a break, Clint Eastwood’s senti-
mental side?” the opposite is quite true. Walt
is a believable character, a true character. It is
hard for Clint Eastwood to become charac-
ters because they are all so Clint Eastwood-y

  

Today’s difficulty level: Mediurn   

similar, but in “Gran Torino,” especially its
ending, Eastwood distances himself from
some of his other characters, and becomes
a different face of Clint Eastwood.

He is Walt Kowalski, a Korean War vet-
eran living in a rapidly changing Detroit. The
beginning of the ﬁlm shows just what kind
of man Walt is — a grumpy, racist, lonely
grandpa. Walt’s Hmong neighbors are con-
stantly harassed by their cousin, nicknamed
Spider (Doua Moua), and his gang. Spider
constantly tries to recruit his teenage cousin,
Thao (Bee Vang), for his gang.

After Walt scares off the gang during
a terrifying confrontation where Thao is
dragged to Spider’s car, the Hmong neigh-
bors, even against Walt’s wishes, become
more of a family than Walt ever had.

Walt’s real family comes together for the
only kind of reunion they have — a funeral.
They arrive to pay respects for Walt’s wife,
Mrs. Kowalksi, even if it’s in hooded snow-
boarding sweatshirts, belly—button rings and
Lions jerseys, as in the case of his spoiled
grandchildren.

Walt hates what the world is turning into.
He thinks it’s a garbage heap ﬁlled with dis-
respectful brats, low—life gangs and dumb
foreigners. He spends most of his days just
sitting on his porch with his dog, washing
down six or seven beers. Surely, he loses
count. _ ’

There’s no hiding around the corner or
trying to ignore it. This ﬁlm "is full of rac-

ists. Eastwood constantly spurts out racial
insults. He goes around calling his neighbors,
“gooks,” “chinks” and “spooks.” When a girl
introduces herself as Yoo, he calls her Yum-
Yum for the rest of the film.

Some might be familiar with this — the
racist grandfather who lets Hispanic slander
or the “n-word” slip from his tongue. Of
course, the family usually just gasps and then
goes on with dinner, trying to ignore him.

If you are offended easily by racism or
if political incorrectness throws you into a
tantrum, stay far away from “Gran Torino.”

But “Gran Torino” isn’t and shouldn’t be
about the racist grandfathers of today but
rather the fears of what we might become
— a lonely, spiteful grandpa edging closer to
death every day. a

While it’s obvious that most of the sup-
porting Hmong characters are not profes-
sional actors, Thao and Sue (Ahney Her),
the teenagers living next door to Walt, end
up being annoyingly stereotypical in their
performances. Even the gang members’ act-
ing gets a little tedious. It is understood that
they’re from the ghetto and are  to be
tough, so there’s no reason to overemphasize
the cliches.

Walt Kowalski is constantly submerged

with thoughts of life and death, according
to a priest at his wife’s church. Upon reach-
ing Walt’s age, though, is it hard to blame
him? When you aren’t thinking about the
day you’re going to die, you’re thinking about
how meaningful your life was. When people
aren’t content with the way their lives went,
they usually don’t put the effort forth to
change it. It’s just too late. If one situation
comes by that could change your entire life,
though, would you be too old and tired to
take it?
I don’t think Walt would.

Wrestling

by Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬂ Wrtter

The stout man leans against a wallwith
one hand on his hip, watching, twitching
and stating at the.ﬂaring limbs.

Deep in the dungeons of Pitt’s Fitzger-
ald Field House, wrestling practice is in full

swing. Six—minute matches, mano a mano, .

full-effort Division I wrestlers going toe-to-
toe in a permanently sweat-stenched room
where there’s no such  as turning the
thermostat up too high. »

‘Watch the hands, watch the hands!” the

man yells with the faintest hint of urgency at V

a practice match  in front of him.

The coach watches two wrestlers as they
continue going at it, speechless. How he
would love to lock arms with the wrestler to
whom he’s now forced to merely coach, but
even he admits that age and engaging in the
sport for around four decades brings some
aches and pains.

It’s still not stopping Rande Stottlemyer
from teaching the sport he loves, and it

him still misses wrestling. '

He continues to watch, not saying anoth- _
er word, but moving everso slightly with the .

movement of the match. One arm folded,

propping up the other as he puts his hand in '

front of his’ mouth.

Just when the match looks to be on the
brink of a decision, the buzzer blares for a
much-needed water break, as evidenced by
the sweat-stained shirts and sweatpants.

i As Stottlemyer paces around the gold-

Wrestling desire burns in

glowing room, bordered with the pictures
of the conference and national champions
as well as All-Americans he has coached,
there must be an inkling on his mind. There
must be the slight itch for the wrestling that
he misses the most.

“When you wrestle them (his student

athletes), there’s a certain respect because ‘

you can do what they’re  to get better
at,” said Stottlemyer. “I can watch it, I can
see it, I can feel it in my own bones, but to

go out and wrestle a six-minute match at a .

high pace, it ain’t happening.”

He wants to wrestle to teach. It is not

so much that he wants to wrestle  just

to fulﬁll his love of the sport. Teaching Pitt

wrestlers is something that gives him the
most satisfaction. Out of all people they will
ever know, Stottlemyer knows exactly what
his athletes are going through. _
“Rande’s a_ lot different than other coach-
es,” said Mark Powell, a ﬁfth-year senior
transfer student from Purdue. “Because he’s
been around the sport for so long, he knows

when you need to rest, knows how hard-
' to go, when to go hard, but he also knows

when to ease back a little bit. He really opti-
mizes your performance;” ,

A blue-collar worker, and at self-titled
“country bumpkin,” Stottlemyer has been a
ﬁxture at Pitt since before his entire roster
of student athletes was even born. ’ A

Stottlemyer grew up in W/ashington

Lands, W Va., and attended Hickory High A

Pitt wrestling coach Rande Stottlemyer has headed the program for 50 years and has
more wins than any coach in Pitt history. Stottlemyer has coached six Pitt wrestlers to ‘

the NCAA Championships.

Freestyle wrestling champion and al PIAA- -

state runner-up.

Stottlemyer came to Pitt in the m1d_1 970s  

to pursue his wrestling career and to experi-
ence the city setting.

“That was the ’70s, it was kind of a
wacko time,” said Stottlemyer. “I had never

ridden a bus or done a lotof that cultural ..

stuff before I came here. But wrestling was
wrestling. You had to work hard at it to be
good.” ’
He became a three-time NCAA All-
American, put together 21 6846-2 record

— and served as team captain for each of his

varsity seasons.

The Pitt men’s wrestling team suffered a

“crushing defeat at the hands of cross-state

/2-

,3;

foe Penn Sunday, falling to the Quakers 20-
1 6.
The Panthers, (2-5, 2-0 EWL), who en-

tered Sunday’s match No. 24 in the nation, _ _

were slightly favored over No. 25 Penn.

It was the first time the schools have
ever squared off.

In one of the day’s biggest surprises,

Penn’s Trey McLean upset senior heavy- 1

weight Zach Sheaffer. -

Though Sheaffer was coming off a

concussion, Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer

expected more from the veteran,”-who has
101 ‘career victories and is one win shy of
Pitt’s top-15 all~time win list.

A “We have got to have our seniors come 9
through,” said Stottlemyer. “He lost and it

was close, but he shouldn’t have lost.”
Despite the defeat, the Panthers had

. some bright spots.

Tyler Nauman, a redshirt gfreshman

pin fall, _a rarity at the college level.

Another freshman, Zac Thomusseit,-

also impressed, winning his match at the

“He  ‘a.-heck of a job,” said Stottle-
myer_.' _‘,‘He'was really focused.” 1»
A Junior  Conroy also pulled
through,  his 133-poundmatch.
Still, the loss likely means a drop from

i the rankings for the Panthers. Although

Penn was expected to be a tough match,
Stottlemyer still believed the Panthers
could have come out victorious. '

“We lost a'_ few we could have had,”f
said Stottlemyer, referring to a devastating _ »

overtime loss at the 125-pound division.

-‘We didn’t step up when we needed to.’-=5

Football

Trio prepares to replace McCoy

by Kyle Craig
smﬂ Lr7,~zza~

As LeSean McCoy prepares for the NFL
Draft and meets with his new agent, Drew
Rosenhaus, the Pitt football team is forced to ﬁll
the offensive void McCoy leaves behind.

Besides McCoy’s production ———- 1,571 rush-
 yards and 21 touchdowns — the Panthers

 also lose his superstar swagger and game-break-
’ ingability. \X/ith McCoy in the backﬁeld, the

Parithers were a competitive team against any
opponent  V 5

To make the situation more difﬁcult, Pitt
doesn’t have a seasoned backup ball—carrier it can
turn to during this transition LaRod Stephens-
Howlingis  and he’s  starting
experience and reliable  with him.

Together, McCoy and Stephens-Howling
accounted for 2,324 yards on the ground and
through the air — 52 percent of the Panthers’ to-
tal offense. They also tallied 26 of the 39 offen-
sive touchdowns the team scored last season

Statistically, the departure of McCoy and
Stephens—Howling appears catastrophic, espe-
cially with Pitt’s futility during the Sun Bowl still
looming in the minds of Pitt fans However, los-
ing players to the NFL and graduation is part of
college football Now, Pitt gets to ﬁnd out who’s
ready to climb up the depth chart and grasp the

opportunity-

Shariff Harris, Kevin Collier and Chris Burns
are slated to compete ﬁ)r the starting position in
the spring. Combined, Harris, a redshirt fresh-
man, and Collier, a redshirt sophomore, totaled
46 rushing yards on 16 attempts during “mop
up” time this past season. Those numbers aren’t
overwhelmingly impressive, but both backs have
more in—game experience than Burns, who spent
his freshman season on the sideline

On the bright side, each back shows intrigu-
ingpotentiaLDur:inglirnitedtirne,Harr:ishas
ﬂashed the ability to run people over, something
rarely seen ﬁrom McCoy or Stephens—Howling.
Collier displayed his shiftiness and lateral quick-
ness at the end of the Syracuse game this past
season

Burns’ role in the offense is still unclear. Some
people around the program who have seen him
practice indicate that he has the playmaking abil-
ity to become Pitfs feature back His develop-
ment and performance during the spring will be
eagerly examined by Panther fans -

 out of  school, Scoutcom
ranked Burns the 14th best back in the nation,
while Rivalscom listed him 15th. High—school
prowess aside, Burns will have to beat out two
more experienced runners to claim the starting
role

Early on, the most: likely scenario involves
all three backs getting touches and receiving an
opportunity to make plays Considering McCo§?s
immense talent, it isn’t hard to imagine that three
people are needed to replace his production

Regardless of who is  the ball for the
Panthers next fall, it’s fair to say that they’ll need
assistance from the passing attack to be effective
McCoy shouldered the entire offensive workload
on several occasions throughout his Pitt career: It
is too much toexpectHarris, CollierorBurns to
ﬁnd success against defenses that are selling out
to stop the run on every play.

If the Panther running-back corps, and of-
fense as a whole, hopes to ﬁnd success in the
future, it will have to discover a way to establish a
balanced offensive attack To do that, Pitt needs
more from the quarterback position, which, be-
tween Bill Stull and Pat Bostick, generated 10
touchdowns compared to 14 interceptions

The numbers indicate that Pitt’s ability to
score points will be the paramount question
surrounding the team as it moves through the
offseason  a great deal can change be-
tween now and August, but as players continue
to train and prepare for spring football, it will be
crucial for them to keepin mind that McCoy isn’t
walking through those locker-room doors — the

onus is on them.

Pitt  back LeSean McCoy evades West Virginia's Sidney Glover in a game this year. McCoy declared for the NFL Draft two
weeks ago. Shariff Harris, Kevin Collier and Chris Burns are vying to replace him for the 2009 season.

Place your Super Bowl bets

by Adam Littman A
Senior Staﬂ WrL'ter

  

People love to bet on the Super Bowl.

It might be difﬁcult to believe, but it’s true. Or at
least that’s what a recent study by the Littman Insti-
tute of Sham Percentages says

The "study says 94 percent of people admit to
having bet on the Super Bowl, and it was the most
fun  they’ve ever done The other six percent
couldn’t be contacted,  because they
can’t alford phones after losing all their money

Track and Field

Panthers succeed at
State Farm Games 

by Ravi Marfatia
Sta/7 Writer

The Pittsburgh track and ﬁeld team had a
successful outing against West Virginia in Mor-
gantown on Saturday, with nine members of the

teamsettingpostseason qualifyingmarksatthe

State Farm Games.

On the mer1’s side, freshman hurdler jer-
maine Lowery ﬁnished fourth in the 60—meter
hurdles, posting a time of 8.38 seconds, which
qualiﬁed him for the Big East postseason.

The Pitt men also looked impressive in the
ﬁeld events,  Dan Kwiatowski and Garrett
Lirkinboth hittingqualifyingmarksinthe shot
put;

In the track events, junior sprinter Maka
Mudekunye won the 60—meter dash with a time
of 7.11 seconds, then followed that performance
by  the 200-meter dash.

Freshman sprinter Dontave Cowsette also
continued Pitt’s success in the sprinting events
by  the 500-meter dash with a time of 1
minute, 6.01 seconds

. Cowsette’s performance continued, as he was

ished second in the 1000-meter with a time of
2:34.04.

then, wrestlers could get away with not “do—
ing the 365” as he calls it, though most of
the decent ones would do as much work in
tl:1e'*sumrner as they could.

“At that time the mindset was just start-

ing where people were working out all year
round,” said Stottlemyer. “I didn’t do it like
they do today.”

Today, Stottlemyer’s work ethic has
evolved into a simple number that becomes
his mantra for anyone wanting to be a suc-
cessful Division I wrestler: 365.

Stottlemyer’s blue-collar mentality took
complete control of him after one particular
loss in high school.

It was his senior year and Stottlemyer
was looking to cap off an outstanding high
school career with a state championship. He
made itto the ﬁnals and looked to be in good
shape, until the unthinkable happened.

“I was ahead by three points with like
seven seconds to go. I was reversed and put
on my back for four and I lost 8-7,” said Sto-

L   maria; at Prusb g

  
 
  
  
 
  

ttlemyer. “There’s always one guy that loses
a heartbreaker in the ﬁnals when they’re
ahead and they had no business losing, and
that was me.”

The loss provided the extra motivation
he needed to push himself in the sport.

“That summer, I went out and wrestled
my butt of ,” said Stottlemyer. “I had a
burning inside me. I knew I couldn’t ﬁnish

— like that.”

Looking back, Stottlemyer said it was
one of the best things to ever happen to
him. It propelled him through college and
soon, almost too soon, afterward into a head
coaching position. ,

“I graduated [from Pitt], and I was an
assistant coach for maybe 11 months,” said
Stottlemyer. “Next thing you know in ’78,
at age 23, I was the head wrestling coach at
the University of Pittsburgh. How crazy is
that?”

To say he’s seen his fair share of Pitts-
burgh history since then would be an under-
statement.

“The kids have made it what it is,” said
Stottlemyer. “Buildings change, professors
change, things like that change, but the kids
and the relationships you build with those
guys, that’s the reason we do what we do.”

He glances off to spot Powell approach-
ing him and greets him with a “Hey, what’s
up?”

Powell asks, for a stretch, Stottlemyer
turns with a smirk on his face to say, “Give
me a minute.”

He is 53, but nobody would know it if
they sawhis agility on his feet. As Powell lies
on his stomach, Stottlemyer, with a glaring
look of focus, steps, turns, twists and hops
around him while working almost every
limb of his body.

He may have lost a step since his glory‘

days, when he was an All—American.

If he could do it, he would, but it won’t
happen.

“The fact that Rande doesn’t wrestle
anymore doesn’t mean he can’t be a good
coach,” said Peters. “Everybody misses the
wrestling. That’s why we stay in it.”

Staying in it is what Stottlemyer does
best. For 30 years, in a world of change, he
has been one of the most consistent aspects
of Pitt.

:

“He sure isn’t going to retire anytime .
soon,” said Peters.
