Quick Announces
Final Statistics
For Registration

 

Freshman Enrollment Shows
Increase Over 1933 - 34;
Other Classes Decline

 

Men OutnumberWomen

According to the ﬁgures in the ﬁnal
first semester registration statistics
compiled by the registrar, John G.
Quick, mien still outnumber the wom-
en on the University camp-us. _

There are 2517 men and 1300 wom-
en, or in relation to the total campus
registration, men make up 65.9 per
cent and the women 34.1 per cent.

Statistics in the report also show
that 73.3 per cent of the freshman
class are men, but that only 65.2 per
cent of the senior class are men.
This is explained for the most part,
according to Mr. Quick, by the trans-
ferring of men into professional
schools in their sophomore yea.r. Other
class comparisons are:

senior, 61.6 per cent men, 38.4 per
cent women; and special and unclas-
siﬁed, 65.2 per cent men, 34.8 per cent
women,

Freshman class increase in enroll-
ment is 103 or 10.4 per cent over last
year. The sophomore class showed
a slight increase of nine or ten per
cent. The three remaining divisions,
junior, senior, special and unclassiﬁed
showed decreases of 5.2 per cent, 2.9
per cent and 23.6 per cent respec-
tively.

In the ﬁrst year classes the School
of Mines leads in percentage of en-
rollment increase with 117.6 per cent
over last year; School of Engineering
is next with 51 per cent; and the
School of Business Administration
follows with 38.1 per cent. The Col-
lege and School of Education showed
a slight decrease of 2.7 per cent.

Total resident enrollment is 8,364,
an increase of 36 or .4 per cent over
ﬁgures of last year.

Comparisons of this semester’s reg-
istration by schools with that of last
year in Mr. Quick’s release are: the
College 2081, a decrease of 1.2 per
cent ;= School ..  iQ. All
increase of .4 p-er cent; School of
Mines, 21.1 per cent; School of Busi-
ness Administration, an increase of
10.6 per cent; School of Education,
631, a decrease of 11.7 per cent;
Johnstowii center, 328, an increase of
12.3 per cent; Erie Center, 328, an in-
crease of 47 per cent; Graduate
School, 1044, a decrease of 7.6 per
cent; Downtown Division, 1973, an in-
crease of 4 per cent; School of Medi-
cine, 265, an increase of 2.3 Del‘ Cent:

Dr. Widiams Leads Forum

Discussion On Nationalism

 

Declaring that nationalism is a rela-
tively recent development, Dr. Benja-
inin H. Vvilliams led a discussion on
the subject at a meeting of the Stu-
dents lnternational Relations group
held Monday in Room 315, Alumni
hall.

Dr, Williams summed up brieﬂy the
history of nationalism, commenting
on its growth in France, Japan and
China.

Commenting on the factors which
have helped develop narrow interna-
tional outlooks, Dr, Williams listed:
race, religion, language and national
literature,

Nationalism _in Japan, Dr. Williams
said, was a recent development and to
a great extent dependent on the indus-
trial revolution.

‘‘If this happens in China.” he add-
ed, “There will be nationalism on a
large scale.”

Class Officers Elected

On Future Cities

Intimates‘ Pittsburgh To Lose
Stigma Of “Smoky Oity”

 

 

’ The city of tomorrow will tend to
reproduce the best aspects of the
country, and the country in turn will
tend vastly more to resemble the
city, according to Dr. E. R. Weidlein,
director of the Mellon institute, in an
address, entitled “The atmosphere for
city beautiﬁcation,” delivered over
KDKA last night.

Dr. ‘Weidlein based his discourse on
observations in Pittsburgh and other
cities, and coupled these facts with
information gathered in the institute.
Pittsburgh, he intimated, issoon due
to lose its stigma as a smoky and
dirty city,

“From the day of its founding,” he
said, “Pittsburgh has been the scene
of a struggle between conﬂicting
forces: one, the constant desire to
conserve and enhance the beauty of
natural resources; the other, the
stern necessity for making practical
use of raw materials, including the
burning of coal.” Now, however, Dr.
Weidlein asserts, a new and better
atmosphere for city beautiﬁcation is
being built up in Pittsburgh.

Smoker For Members
Sponsored By Sigma Tau

 

 

A smoker sponsored by Sigma Tau.
honorary fraternity of the School of
Engineering, will be held tomorrow
night, The smoker will serve as a
get-acquainted meeting for active
members of the organization and stu-»
dents.

Eligibility for membership in Sigma
Tau depends upon a junior or senior
class standing in the School of Engi-
neering and a 1.5 scholastic average
for the preceding semester.

The speakers will be L. C. McC'and-
liss, faculty adviser of Sigma Tan and
head of the department of civil engi-
neering; and Jack Helquist, ME35,
president of the fraternity. Refresh-
ments will be served at the close of
the evening.

 

Engineers Threat-en
Another ‘Niki: Paws’

It has been found on good, but
unofficial authority that the se-
mester issue of that classic publi-
cation of the School of Engineer.

ing, the Nitt Pews, is due on
campus tomorrow.-
Charles M. Hamish, EE35,

chairman of the Engineering As-
sociation dance scheduled for No-
vember 16, is reputed to be editor
of the paper. No information
could be obtained by the News of
the make-up of the sheet this
semester.

At its last appearance, the Nitt

Bervard Nichols Sees I Increasing
Problem In Assimilation Of
Potential Workers

As seen by Bervard Nichols, editor
of the Pittsburgh Business Review, in
a special article for that publication,
the most serious problem of the pres-
ent unemployment situation is the
great number of people never before
employed, now seeking jobs.

Eight per cent of the total employ-
able population in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, 40,000 individuals of whom a lit-
tle less than half are women, are now
seeking jobs in Allegheny county who
have never before been employed. ,

Taking this with the number of
those previously employed but now
out of work, Nichols ﬁnds the problem
doubly serious when he notes that ‘of
all those gainfully employed in normal
times, nearly one-third were out of
work in April, 1934.

-Tlie increase of unemployment be-
gan in Allegheny county in 1929,
but the problem of idle workers did
not become pressing until the latter
part of 1930. By August, 1932, the total
had reached 406,000, and with the ex-
ception of one insigniﬁcant decrease
in late 1932, steadily‘ mounted until
April, 1933. At that time 43 per cent
of the entire working population were

unemployed. In the last 18 months
the ﬁgure has dropped to 31 per cent,
but even with this improvement, the
situation in the Pittsburgh district re-
mains serious. Approximately 297,000
are without work, and of those em-
ployed only 50 per cent have full-tinie
employment.

Unemployment among foreign born
whites is less than among native
whites, a result, perhaps, of their
smaller number and their domination
of hard labor jobs. Only 29 per cent
of the males and but 26 per cent of
foreign-born females are without em-
ployment. . . . 

‘Al greater proportion of negroes are
unemployed than are the whites, and
a greater number of women are out of
work than men, Less than 31 per
cent of white males are unemployed
and only 35 per cent of white females,
as contrasted with the 48 per cent of
colored males and 55 per cent of col-
ored females seeking employment.

Engineers, Miners
To Hold Banquet

Plan Festival For Twenty-Fifth
Anniversary Of Site Change

Friday night graduates of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines will
celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the moving of their schools to their
present site on the University campus
with a banquet at Hotel Schenley.

The banquet has been arranged by
H. C. George, head of the department
of oil and gas. Mr. George is being
assisted by R. M. Totten, CE15, who
is chairman of the Alumni committee
for the affair. Dr. F. L. Bishop, pro-
fessor of physics in the School of En-
gineering, will act as toastmaster.

-Guest speakers will include Samuel
A. Taylor, consulting engineer for Iron
City Electric company; Charles W.
Ridinger, president of Iron -City Elec-
tric company, and S. M. Kintiier, vice
president of the Westinghouse Elec-
tric company and former professor of
electrical engineering at the Univer-
sity.

The former site of the two schools
was on Perrysville avenue on the
North Side. In 1909 the Schools of
Engineering and Mines were moved
to campus. The School of Engineer-
ing was established in 1865 and the
School of Mines was ﬁrst; authorized
by an act of the state legislature in
1895.

Cap And Gown Alumni
Meet, Plan Next Show

The ﬁrst plans for the forthcoming’;

Cap and Gown show were discussed at
a meeting of the members of the
Graduate Cap and Gown club last
night in the Schenley hotel.

The officers of the Graduate club
a.re;- George F, -MacDonald, presi-4
dent; Dr. F. D. Brantlinger, vice pres-
ident; Dr. Benjamin Levant, second
vice president; John M. St. Peter, sec-
retary; and Dr. Leo Shongield, treas-
urer.

Congress and is favorable to the ob-
jectives of the national administra-
tion.

Commenting on the recent attack
on inflation and the New Deal by
Senator David A. Reed, Republican of
Pennsylvania, Congressman Ellenbo-
gen said, “Any attack that Senator
Reed makes on the New Deal will
mean votes for the Democratic party.”

In regard to the attack of Governor
Pinchot on George Earle, Democratic
gubernatorial candidate, as a tax
dodger, Ellenbogen declared, “Earle is
not a tax dodger. The state claimed
that the corporation with which Earle
is connected failed to pay its taxes.
This is a matter which lies between
the corporation and the govei.‘nment.”

Commenting on the statement made
by E. H. Coleman, head of the Alle-
gheny County Republican committee.-
at the Inquiry forum last week, that
“the President is surrounded by a
group of inexperienced professors,”
Ellenbogen said, “Coleman’s conten-

tion is a lot of nonsense.”

Foreign Policy Association

- Dean Of College

To Make Formal
Bow Next Month

College Association Assembly
Will Introduce Dr. Spencer
To Students Of School

Seek Free Class Hour

Dr. Herbert Spencer, who is serv-
ing his ﬁrst year as dean of the Col-
1986, will be formally introduced to
the students of that school at a spe-
cial assembly some time next month.

DOD ‘Campbell, ’35, president of the
College Association, disclosed that his
Orgaiiization is sponsoring the assem-
bly in an attempt to supplemgent its
Drogram of dances and scholarship ex-
tensions and “bring together a closer
association among students and fac-
ulty members of the College.”

Dr. Spencer, who was appointed
dean of the College this semester, has
never addressed any meeting of stu-
dents here except the Freshman ban-
quet duriiig orientation week in Sep-
tenibcr.

Although no deﬁnite date has been
set for the assembly, it will probably
take place about the middle of No-
vember, Campbell said, and “is as
deﬁnite as such things can be.”

“The college student of the future”
is the tentative subject of Dr. Spen-
cer's address.

Maxine Christensen, ’35, and Harvey
Goldsteiii, '37, both members of the
cabinet of the College Association,
have been appointed by Campbell to
make preliminary arrangements for
the event.

A particular attempt will be made
to obtain a free fourth hour on some
Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, dur-
ing the coming month. Even if the
dismissal of all classes in the College
at that time is not authorized, the as-
sembly will take place anyway, Camp-
bell maintained,

Each year the College Association
has arranged at least one general as-
sembly for students in that school.
Primarily, the association is function-
ing to sponsor two dances each semes-
ter—a formal and an informal. It
also extends a number of short term
loans and scholarship notes to needy
and worthy College students.

Exception To A Motion

HAT MIGHT be a brand new, perfectly good

idea came out of California Monday when
Santa Monica’s \Vi1l Rogers made his Rose Bowl
choices. _

Said Columnist Rogers: “It looks llke ‘Elle
Army and Navy both got good football teams, and
I hereby make this as a motion, a Congressional
motion, that if they both breeze through, and even
after playing each other (and if it’s a good close
game), that both teams be brought out to the Rose
Bowl.”

It is just possible, of course, that Army and Navy
will reach their game together without having been
previously defeated this season.

It is just possible that Army will hold Navy to
that “good close game.”

But Navy, at least, will not “breeze throughf.’

Unless there is some way to cancel that appoint-
ment with Mr. Sutherland ’s Scythe two weeks
from Saturday.

Civil Service As A Goal

WO MORE Eastern colleges have just made

room in their curricula for programs of study
in civil service. The list of schools leading this
movement now includes: Princeton, which coin-
menced a civil service department last year, Har-
vard, a.nd \Villiam and Mary.

The place of civil service training in conteinpor-
ary universities is indisputable. The increase in
government personnel which the present adininis-
tration has brought about is not likely to disap-
pear, whatever party or coalition of pai't.y incin-
bers wins the elections of 1934 and 1936. The
Rooscveltian extension of government has made
civil employment, including state and local gov-
ernment jobs, the vocation of the largest single
group of workers in the United States.

Speaking of the need for a trained personnel in
government, on the occasion of receiving one of his
honorary doctorates, President Roosevelt has said:
“\Ve need a trained personnel. \Ve need disinter-
ested, as well as broad-gauged public officials. This
part of our problem we have not yet solved.”

A tendency toward heavier enrollments at the
University in classes in political science, economics
and history shows that students here have moved
to solve part of the problem electively. A

Special training inihthese subjects we hope to see
greatly increased, at a time when every indication
points to the fact that the country is more and
more entrusting its direction to the civil service.
Such a civil service, trained and recruited from
Oxford and Cambridge by a selective process of

New System At Chicago
Has Succeeded, ,De,an.Says

By Bernard Fleming

An experiment in modern education which dispenses
with credits, course marks, and compulsory class attend-
ance, being carried on by the University of Chicago in its
College, is showing a marked advancement over the Col-
lege's former method of instruction.

The new plan, in its fourth year at the University,
gives students full latitude in use of their time. They
are judged for course completion by their ability to pass
batteries of comprehensive examinations rather than at-
tendance in classes and ability to pass instructors’ exam-
inations.

Concentration by the Chicago faculty on course de-
sign has resulted in better selection of materials and
better class organization. It is no longer necessary to be
in residence at the College, and a student may take the
comprehensive examinations, seven in number, whenever
he thinks it advisable. Examinations are six hours long,
divided between morning and afternoon on a given day.

Each student must pass 42 hours of exams, at one

exam period of two weeks or spread them over several
periods within two calendar years. For all students
there are ﬁve general comprehensive(examinations speci-
ﬁcally required in these ﬁve ﬁelds: English composition;
biological sciences, the humanities, social sciences and
physical sciences. Two additional examinations are
elective; chosen, usually, from the departmental ﬁelds.

According to Chauncey S. Boucher, dean of the College,
the results of Chicago’s experiments are gratifying: “As
a result of printed syllabi and, particularly, of our exam-
ination system, we have developed in three years more
signiﬁcant improvements in the clear deﬁnition of educa-
tional objectives, and in the selection of materials and
their organization and presentation than would other-
wise have come in a score of years. These gains are at-
tributable primarily to our abandonment of the course
credit system and the adoption of a program of compre-
hensive examinations.”

Eliot ‘Prophet
Of Impotence’

—— Maarer

I

 

By Herrymon Maurer

N AN EARLIER issue of the Pitt News I spoke of the
changing T. S. Eliot as a symbol of the changing lit-
6l‘3-1')’ Credos of the last decade. Perhaps it might be ad-
visable to discuss the earlier stable Mr. Eliot and the

later vacillating Mr. Eliot in more detail,

T. _S. Eliot has,spent most of his eﬁective literary life
denying in technically astounding verse the romantic ef-
fusions and the “all’s well with the world” announce-
ments found here and there throughout the English lit-
erary tradition. This is all he has attempted. In the
face of despair and disillusion he has had the strength
only to announce his own and others’ impotence.

His poems, destructive of age-cherished illusions, a.re
on the whole true—at least for this age——a1tliough Eliot
feels, perhaps, having found the undraped body of illu-
sion scrawny and sick, that in few periods was that
frame more healthy. Modern artists assert their uni-
versality and turn their back on history. In all events,
the ﬁrst poem which called my attention to T. S. Eliot is
wittily true and valuable to our own age:

At mating time the hippo’s voice
Betrays inﬂexions hoarse and odd,
But every week we hear rejoice
The Church, at being one with God.

The descendant of the romantic ﬁgures of the past is
J. Alfred Prufrock, but this gentleman is a weary ro-
mantic and Eliot ﬁnds in his wanderings nothing but dis-
illusion. So much for what is said. As for the saying
of it, Eliot has endeavored to complicate the issue as
much as possible. The reader is to wade through line
after line of cuiiningly subtle phrase, endeavor to pene-
trate some introductory lines in Italian, perform a num-
ber of mental gymnastics, and then undergo an esthetic
thrill upon discovering what the poem is about.

After an introductory line in Greek, a poem of much
the sa.me sort as “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,”
“Sweeney Among the Nightingales,” is more clear in its
presentation of repulsion because of vulgarity:

The person in thelspanish cape
Tries to sit on Sweeiiey’s knees,
Slips and pulls the table cloth,
Overturns a coffee cup,
Reorganized upon the ﬂoor,

She yawns and draws a stocking up.

He Deserts “The Hippo”

Still, in the Love Song, particularly, Mr. Eliot deserted
the strong clarity of “the Hippopotamus,” and, feeling
no doubt that he had little to say, attempted to embellish
his poem with allegorical uncertainty. Here he began
to line up with the French syiiibolistic school. A poem,
that school would have one understand, is better and
more important if the artist expresses a littie bit of his
idea——a.nd adds. confusion even to that little bit-and
leaves for the reader the probein of uiitaiigliiig and ﬁnd-
ing out the rest. The reaction which one gets from suc-
cessfully threading one’s way through a maze of uncer-
tainty is called the esthetic emotion. This theory evi-
dently appealed to Mr. Eliot since he became a French
poet writing in English.

“The Waste Land” is his best poem. Here he is too
terriﬁed to complicate the issue as much as he does in
the Love Song——altliough there remains much that is
not clear. But the burning fright of disillusion hits
clearly and effectively. We feel the meaningless, the
pettiiiess, the vulgarity of certain phases of modern life,
and we remember the oppressive vacancy of the line
spokeiiin the pub, “Hurry up please, it’s time.”

That there are constructive forces
scene, it is difficult to deny.

in the present
But Mr. Eliot has not come

in Contact with these forces, and so he follows “The '

Vvaste Land” with another expression of impotence,
“The Hollow Men,” in which he beats loudly on his own
chest and discovers it to be hollow. Everybody else’s
chest is hollow, too, and Mr. Eliot pens a confession of
the defeat of the world.

It seems that after so much expression of futility, Eliot
had difficulty in drinking any more of his own liquor.
It was at this time that he embraced “Classicism in lit-
era.ture, ro_vali-sin in politics, and anglo-Catholicism in
religion.” Solace he found somehow in these institu-
tions, however unable he was to- deﬁne them. Not only

could he drink no more of his own liquor, however nau- '

seating and revolting it might be, but he could turn to
dead institutions of the past, institutions which he could
not expla.iii, This was the supreme expression of im.
potence, in comparison with “The Hollow Man,” for in
that poem Eliot faces his conclusion, is tonic.

Eliot Becomes Critic

With his new credo Mr. Eliot turned to the profession
of critic. His ideas at once stood forth as completely
bemuddled and disjointed.‘ "Mr. Eliot both attacked and
praised certain phases of fascism, dogmatism, disinter-
estedness, dictatorships. He appeared and still appears
to be pleased by dogmatisni and dictatorship, but not
dictatorship of any radical variety. However, he read
Marx and commented on his profound analysis, but said
that, however complete and tonic communism might be,
its anti-religious ideas kept away those with religious
faith. I believe a. Mr. Schapps commented on the fact
that religion may exist in a communistic state although
in a private and not political form. But nonetheless Mr.
Eliot stayed on the safe road of senseless conservatism
and muddled criticism.

Certainly Mr. Eliot is hollow now.
our indebtedness to him. We must not deny his remark-
able technical excellence. Besides, however much he
has complicated the issue, on occasion he has given us
poems strongly expressive of the impotence and futility
of modern traditional life. Too much the temperamental
artist—concerned with the moods of now—a.nd not
enough the man—concerned with doing something about
something out-of-oi'der—he has limited himself decisive-
ly. We can only say, paraphrasing Gertrude Stein’s
words on Hemingway, “We are thankful for what we
got; it was not much and we wish it were more.” And
we shall point out clearly, as Miss Stein did not, that the
fault is with the teacher, not with the student.

ed, looking, I hope, dubious.

“Sure?” I ventur-

“You never saw a better one, did

you?” she replied, and since I liadn’t, I meekly essayed, “\Vell,
thanks for telling me,” and stepped on her foot.

“Oh that’s quite all right,” she gui-gled———if you know Sally,
you will admit that she does gurgle——-and we slipped around some

more until the music was over.

It was quite by accident that Sally
and I were dancing together. The
senior women were making a big play
for some senior men—this was last
Friday niglit—and we were there to
enjoy the occasion. Unfortunately—
although the question of fortune de-
pended upon where and how you stood
—the stag line was longer than that
of -the deer, and Sally and I had met
on the rebound.

I had always wondered what a ghost
was like underneath it all, and was
about to ﬁnd out, when that tall Pick-
ering fellow (pittpourri to you) re-
marked over my shoulder, “Tut tut.
must be decent, you know. After all,
even a ghost . .” so I gave it up.
I looked around long enough to notice
that the 22 lights (electric) had been
camouﬂaged into every color save
white, and these, plus an assortment
of oak leaves and the ghost, gave the
place a festive appearance.

When the music started a.gain—al-

‘ thouglrtliose that were interested in

the music for art’s sake were heard
complaining —— I watched the stags,
who toward the end of the dance were
gaining courage. The circle around
the floor grew tighter and tighter,
with the fellows edging in on the
dancing couples. Betty Black and Kit
Hall were tapped (honorary?) and
then the rush began.

I managed to get out of the jam at.

the same time that all the other seeds
were going in, and so I could watch
it. The girls averaged seven steps
per man. Everyone was becoming
merry_ when the music stopped, and
the stags beat a hasty retreat, I
afterwards deduced that the rush had
come so late because the ﬁve gallons
of cider that Foreman brought from
the Pi Kap house had lasted most of
the evening. Next time, though. that
he wants to dance with his partner,
he'll bring ten gallons—we hope.

The nicest part was the fact that
it was so exclusively  senior affair.

Dear Father:

Since I have recently become a re-
porter on the Daily News-, I have area-
son to visit the Cliancellor’s ofﬁce, and
so I did yesterday, when I knew he
was in VVashington. He has the high-
est position in the University in more
ways than one, for his oﬁice is on the
top floor, the fortieth, in the Cathe-
dral. Miss Hammer, his seci'eta.ry,
greeted me somewhat skeptically, but
ﬁnally I was admittedto the oﬂice,
‘and once there, saw why he had de-
serted the suite in State Hall.

His office looks out on all sides of
the Cathedral through huge bay win-
dows of glass and tracery. From his
desk, he can look directly downtown,
and by shifting his eyes to the right
can peer all over campus. The people
below, moving about, look no larger
than dots. Behind him is East Lib-
erty, and from the fourth side, he
-views the engineering department
building where old Carnegie Tech
used to raise a separate standard.

As the integrating force of the Uni-
versity, he has at least physically S9-
lected the one point from which he
can see the whole school. It is from
his office that all the great visitors ob-
serve the views, and it was here that
those scientiﬁc tests were made last
yea;-_ It is the only sheltered ob-
servation point at the top.

For the student or visiting observer,
the room is closed, naturally, yet there
a.re eight higher points. In each of
the four turrets that surmount the
building there are two platforms, with
stairs, very decorative, between them.
These are open to anyone With 3 D91‘-
mit. A week ago yesterday, Dr-
Sherman held a Student council ban-
quet in his office, and served thr-
whole .meal right there; so you can
gather what facilities there are-

After the banquet the Chancellor
spoke to them and his talk was broad-
cast from the school station NECP,
which stands for National Education
Center at Pittsburgh. He spoke Well,
of course, yet he must have been con-
scious of many elements in the situ-
ation: here was he in a beautiful
room, before intelligent students, in
the most remarkable education build-
ing of the century, speaking over the
strongest station in Pennsylvania,
what he hopes will be the heartiest
welcome a. chancellor ever offered stu-
dent representatives. Vive Le Chan-
cellor!

Old Manuscripts
Washed, Ironed,
Then Stored

Manuscripts are washed and pressed
daily at the Vvestern Pennsylvania
Historical Society building under the
supervision of Franklin F. Holbrook,
acting director.

“Oh yes,” said his assistant, “we
always wash a manuscript before we
ﬁle it away. Of course we have to
be careful in using the sponge. VVe
must also test the paper ﬁrst to see
that the ink doesn’t run, but you’d be
surprised how tough those old papers
are. They can stand more wear and

tea.r than a modern newspaper ever
could.” '

After the washing, wrinkles are
pressed out of every manuscript and
its sides basted with a special Japa-
nese mending tissue before the paper
is locked up in a dustproof box. Some-
times the manuscripts are shipped
downstairs to the “dark room” so that
photographs can be taken of them.

The Historical society's latest acqui-
sition is the toll book of the Monon-
gahela Bridge company from 1818 to
1845 when the bridge was destroyed
by ﬁre.

 
 

Among other things, the toll,

book records that on January 19, 1832
the “Bridge fell down into the river”

and a year later it was recovered.
Another new acquisition is the Burd

papers which include such items as
the order of a general in the Revolu-
tion, signed by Colonel Burd, declar-
ing that “No person is to purchase
from the Indians until Mr. Croghon
comes Home and sees the General.”

Pitt Gets Ready 5
For Battle With I
Ascending Irish

Laydenmen Exhibit More Power
And Punch In Every Game;
May Hit Peak For Pitt

 

 

crest of a victory
wave that has now reached three
straight games, the Irish of Notre
Dame come to town Friday to prepare
to help Pitt celebrate a Homecoming
Day with a football game Saturday
afternoon. There is nothing that the
Irish would relish more than running
that victory streak to four straight.

At the outset of the season, when
Notre Dame lost a 7-6 opening strug-
gle with Texas, the horde of Irish
followers began looking around for
other bandwagons to mount. Layden
would need another year, they
thought, and away they went.

It took just one Week for the Lay-
denmen to change all that. With the
second and third teams playing most
of the game, the Irish socked it to
the boys from Purdue for an 18-7 vic-
tory. News of that ball game brought
the horde of followers scampering
back pell-mell with their ticket stubs
and put them all once more in the
Notre Dame chorus.

Since then they have had no cause
for regret. The South Benders bump-
ed off an old-time nemesis, Carnegie
Tech, by a two-touchdown margin
without working up much of a sweat.
Just last Saturday these up and com-
ing green-jerseyed fellows backed the
Badgers of Wisconsin up against a
wall and walked off with a 19-0 vic-
tory.

According to all reports, the Notre
Dames looked like a ball club while
beating Wisconsin. The starting back-
ﬁeld of Frohmart, Shakespeare, Me-
linkovich, and Elser, while not caus-
ing anyone to get out the pictures of
the famous “Four Horsemen,” show-
ed a lot of power and ability as they
picked up the yardage against the
Badgers, a. team of no mean repute.

It appears, then, that the Irish out-
ﬁt has been picking up more class
from Saturday to Saturday, much in
the manner of a snowball rolling
down hill. Whether or not they will
have come along far enough o11 the
road toward being a great team will
be settled in part by. the Pitt game
Saturday.

The Panther triumph over \Vest—
minster’s Titans last Saturday leaves
them with nothing of more importance
than a few very muddy jerseys. The
ﬁrst outﬁt, with the exception of Or-
miston, saw some action, but just
enough of it to make the changing
into their uniforms worthwhile. Mean-
while the reserves gained what neces-
sary experience may be derived from
shoving the XVestminster boys around
in a very muddy ﬁeld.

Most of the bumps and bruises sus-
tained in the hard Minnesota battle
have been ironed out by Trainer
Moore and the Panthers should be in
top form to meet whatever the Irish
have to offer. It’s just barely possible
that the Laydenmen will be offering
the most they have given this year.

Varsity Concludes
Pre-Season Drill

Basketball Pavilion Remodeled
By Stadium Repair Crew

Having ﬁnished its preliminary
practice last week, the varsity basket-
ball squad again takes a vacation.
The boys will remain idle for two
weeks before resuming their practices
for the coming season,

At the last few practices Doc Carl-
son, varsity coach, used a large num-
ber of different comjbinations of play-
ers for the tentative varsity. -Claire
Cribbs, last year’s all-American cen- .
ter, has been alternating between cen-
ter and forward. Pete Noon takes
Cribb’s center post when the latter is
at forward. Skippy Hughes, Ted 7
Roderick, Ross Emerick, Slim Wainio, .
and Ken Kuno, have all been moved
back and forth, between guard and
forward positions, each having a
chance for a berth on the varsity. ,

With an easy week ahead of them,
the varsity men also have a pleasant ‘
week, journeying to the Jacktown Ho-
tel, near Irwin on the Lincoln High-
way, for a chicken dinner Thursday '
night. “Doc” claims he supplies the
ﬁnancial backing for the diner.

During the time that the varsity
did not practice, the stadium crew of
repairmen ﬁnished their work on the
basketball ﬂoor and the seats. The
seats, under the basket at the upper
end of the ﬂoor have been moved back
ﬁve feet to give the players more
room on the ﬂoor. Formerly, players ~
on the teams had a difficult time to
keep from running into the seats and .
spectators while cutting into that
basket. The seats have all been rein-
forced, while those behind the basket
were replaced with new ones.

Notre Dame Schedule ;

For the beneﬁt of the many 10-
cal friends of Notre Dame, a
schedule of their coming week-
end is printed. The Irish leave
South Bend at 9 o'clock Thurs-
day evening on a special train,
bringing with them some forty
football players. They expect to
arrive at about 7:30 o’clock Fri-
day morning in the Pennsylvania
station.

After allowing the news pho-
tographers the necessary time
for their pictures, the football
men will be hurried off to their
quarters at the Pittsburgh Ath-
letic association, Private work-
out for the players before the
cameramen will be held at 2
o’clock. The team plans to leave
Pittsburgh at 10:40 following the
game. '

Notre Dame’s band will not ac-
company the team, according to
the schedule given out by the
publicity department of Notre
Dame.

Panther Harriers
Meet N otre Dame

Olson Men Eager To Win Again
Following Defeat By State

 

 

All branches of the cross-country
team will be in action this week-end.
The varsity will run against the un-
defeated harriers of Notre Dame in a
dual meet Saturday morning at 11
o’clock on the Schenley Park course.
Prior to this event, the Junior AMA

championships will be run off at 10'

o’clock. In_this meet Coach Olson
plans to enter both the freshman and
junior varsity teams. ,

At Penn State last Saturday after-
noon the varsity harriers gave the
Nittany Lion runners their stiffest
competition of this season, going
down to a 31-24 defeat. Racing over
the ﬁve and one-tenth mile course at
the Saucon Valley country club, Cap-
tain Harvey of State and his team-
mate, Book, came within a few sec-
onds of breaking the course record
as they led the ﬁeld home. The time
for the long grind was 27 minutes, 46
seconds.

Kirkpatrick was the ﬁrst Panther

to ﬁnish, trailing the two State run"-_;
ners by approximately seven seconds.
He was fo.lowed by W'a.genhouser and
Musico of Pitt who came in ﬁfth and
sixth, respectively. The rest of the
field was strung out in the following
order: Detwiler, State, sixth; Alexan-
der, State, seventh; Downey, State,
eighth; Tost, Pitt, ninth; and Al-
bright, Pitt, tenth.

The Pitt team will have another op-
portunity to beat the State runners
as both teams are entered in the IC4A
meet in New York on November 19.

Following Panthers
To New Castle

 

By Charles A. Ruch

Vvestminster is a. college located at
New lvilmington, Pa. There are
some who claim that there should be
two “i’s” in Westminster. There are
others who claim that two are not
necessary since there isn't that much

to see. After spending a night there,
the author doesn't choose to take
sides.

To begin with there was a dance.
The dance started at 8 o’clock and
was scheduled to end at 11, the time
when all self-respecting Pitt students
are arriving at their dances. Dances
are pretty much the same everywhere
and if one can imagine holding such
an affair at the stadium basketball
lpavilion, one gets a general idea of
it all.

Of particular interest was the
method of intermissions. The coeds
lare not allowed to smoke on campus,
llet alone in the dance place. That
‘ encourages a great scurrying for hats
and coats, after which the boys and
girls strike out for cars and roar away
from the campus limits. They allget
back sooner or later. ' c

The coeds living in the dorms must
be in by 11:30. By the time the coats
and hats are collected again, it lacks
but 15 minutes of that time and every-

lege Inn." I

It has not been estimated just how.
many English themes have been writ-l
ten at Westminster about “Collegel
Inn,” but it is safe to say that every;
student has taken at least one crack
at it. There is no time wasted there,
there are no checks. This eating
process has to be done in a hurry and
the honor system goes, except in the
ﬁghts for choice booths.

The mob rattles around the room,
eating and yelling and laughing and
calling for all kinds of odd concoc-
tions of which “slush” is the only one
worth remembering. This is served
in a glass and consists of ice cream,
chocolate syrup, and a dash or two of
whatever else the attendant happens
to spill into the glass while preparing
the delight. A remark is made about
the crowd. “You should try,” sug-
gests one of the native sons, “to get
in here during chapel hour.”

After the girls are returned safely
to their dorm the boys hit for the
fraternity houses. The fraternity
houses are ‘frame affairs with rather
conspicuous ﬁre escapes. The latter
is a tip passed on to a local Greek
house. Here the boys engage in the
usual bull-sessions, prominent among
which discussion is the surprising in-
formation (secured ﬁrst-hand from
the “team”) that the Pitt boys play
a very clean brand of football.

Some people masquerade as spooks
or witches; others go to taffy pulling
parties, and still others go out and
ring doorbells. The sophomore women
will do none of these. They
celebrate Halloween by having a
Dunker party at 12:30 o’clock today
in Heinz House.

Doughnuts, the approved by all
good dunkers, will be served with ap-
Admission is free.

The program, to be presented by
talented sophomores, includes dances
by Bernice Simpson and Mary Jo
Kunkle; an original musical skit by
Mary pou Dowling and Lula Sekey,
and a reading by Betty Knop.

Juniors To Pay Dues

Square cards with the inscription “l

around campus. This is the method
adopted by the junior women’s ﬁnance
committee to get women to pay their
class dues. Margaret Lehm, class

treasurer, is chairman of the ﬁnance

I Multiplier Today

Today at 11:30 o’clock will be one
time when one person equals four per-
sons. It’s not good logic, but senior
women rule that it is correct as far
as their Chocolate Multipliers are con-
cerned.

Last Vvednesday, every member of
the senior women’s cabinet attended
the first l\lu1tiplier, and today each
will bring three additional women.
Therefore, one senior last VVednesday
equals four seniors today.

Helene Green and Mary Smith are
in charge of this informal series of

get-acquainted socials.

By Eleanor Knight
Sociology and piccalilli are all in
the day’s work to Ann McAfee, C35.

She is a good example of the old
maxim, “The more you do. the more
you can do.” Of herself she says,
“I'm not at all a serious person” and
she threatens to shoot me at sight if
I write an article describing her as a
long—faced individual intent only on
seeing how much she could do and in
how short a time. Not wishing in-
complete grades this semester, I shall
write about her in the “flippant” man-
her which she requested.

She is of medium height . . has

what digniﬁed manner . . great vi-

tality, energy and capacity for work
. a sense of humor . . . a modest
person . . .

In commenting upon her work at
the University, Mrs. McAfee said,
“Parents have just as much right and
obligation to get an education as their
children. They must keep abreast of
the times in order to understand the
viewpoint of youth.”
