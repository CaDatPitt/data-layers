Grandy Winner

Dick Grandy, a liberal arts
math major, was last year’s re-
cipient of the award. Desiring to
improve his French, after four
trimesters of the language, he
studied six weeks at an extension

‘ of the University of Aix Mar-

seilles, Nice, France.

Calling it a “tremendous-ex-V
perience to see an amazing variety
of cultures,” Grandy feels that it
is “important to have some idea
of what you want to do before
you go, because there is just so
much to see.” Tangiers, where he
stopped on his way to Europe,
and East Berlin proved most in-
teresting. Summing up his ex-
periences as “S” Award recipient,
Grandy remarked,‘ “It’s _a taste

Pitt News editor Matthew
Nesvisky stated last week that-
“this fMarch Forth on March

lent opportunity to visit other
schools, mingle with other stu- »
"dents, herald. the approaching
spring season and prove that
Pitt students ‘have college

The idea of themarch occurred

  ‘Apathy at Pitt’ TttzhMet With Apathy

'5:

Heath Leads SUB Discussion

 

UNSYMPATHETIC with the apathetic are panel-
Professor Lawrence Lee,

ists Bernard Adams,

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Three people out of ap-‘

proximately 250- responded
favorably to the query “did

' you feel that this discussion

was worthwhile?” after Mon-
day’s SUB panel‘ discussion

about “Intellectual Apathy ‘at
Pitt.”
Forceful, provocative opening

statements were at first expected
from m-embers of the panel, since
Dr. Roy Heath, director of the
University Counselling Center for
Student Affairs, asked all report-
ers to leave for what was to be a
closed discussion.

He did ,however, allow The Pitt
News to be represented as part
“of the University circle.”

Expectation Dissipated

This expectation was soon dissi-
pated. “There is relatively little
here,” commented Bernard Adams,

.rspecial assistant to the Chancellor,
'. “although I shall probably be op-

posed in this view by the mem-
bers of the faculty who have you
‘in class.”

Adams continued to state that
the student is “more idealistic
because he cares.” Arts senior
Sheila Rinnie. did not share
Adams’ sentiments. Miss Rinnie

;stated that “Students are just
. interested in fulﬁlling require-
- ments or getting a good grade.

Anything learned from a course
is not used. The majority of the
students are muchttoo complac-
ent.”

English and humanities profes-
sor Lawrence Lee, asserted that it
is “not in the nature of manfto
be apathetic. If students are apa-
thetic we should seek the source
of illness within ourselves. The
American student needs to do
more for himself.”

‘You Have to Be Blind’

Lionel Rothkrug, history and
social science instructor, demand-
ed to know why “students don’t
get excited about ideas. You have
to be blind not to see the apathy.”

He went on to call for a beer
hall “where 3.2 beer would be
served where students can stay
up all night and freely argue
over the world's problems over
a pitcher of beer. If there are
no bull sessions, the students
will not apply their knowledge.”

Martin Landy, the other student
on the board, said that only some
students are apathetic. “You must
divide the body of college students
and see the apathetic group and
the‘ unapathetic group.”

Discussion Opened

Dr. Heath then opened the dis-
cussion to the many observers.
Unfortunately, many (of them
simply wanted to observe. There
were, however, a number of com-
ments and questions from the
ﬂoor. A

Dr.»Roy Heath (standing), senior Sheila Rinnie,
Lionel Rothkrug,and junior Martin Landy.

I

. —_ Pitt News Photo
R

Jon Samburg, Liberal Arts
freshman, maintained that “if a
student has enough interest to
go to college, it is because he
wants to learn. If there is intel-
lectual apathy, "it is generated
by the administration or’ fac-
ulty. If’ a professor -has nothing
tooffer, apathy will occur.”‘

Dr. Lee asserted that he agreed
completely. He went on to add,
though, that “it is the greatest job
to generate discussions in class.
Students are very vociferous "in
the halls, when I am on my way to
ameeting, but not in class.” '

Most Forceful Speakers

The most forceful speakers
from the audience turned'out to
be a progressively more incoher-
ent, but rightly excited, graduate
student, not a University gradu-
ate,‘however, and a Saudi Arab-
ian with a British accent who
asked “do you want many people
half educated or just a few that
are well educated?” Discussion on
this question did not follow.

.Murdo MacLeod associate
professor of history and social sci-
ence observed that when arriving
at college “the student is inform-
ed that he is an adult. Then the
administration puts all sorts of
juvenile restrictions on him. The
student is in an indecisive posi-
tion. As long as the administration
dominates a campus, there will be

no intellectual excitement.” '

Procedure Changes Announced

For Paying Dorm Deposits

Associate Dean of Women
.Savina Skewis, has announced
that there will be a change in the
procedure for paying dorm de-
posits.

Previously, a charge of $35 was
paid by freshmen entering the
University. When damage occur-
-red in the dorm rooms, cost for
it was subtracted from the $35
deposit. The remainder or all of it
was refunded upon graduation.

Bookkeeping Trouble

This has proved to be a great
deal of trouble to the 12th floor
‘bookkeeping system and a dis-
turbance to students who usually
‘had to wait 90 days to get their
refund.

This process will be discon-
tinued after the Spring term. In
April, when women students
who desire to room in the dorms"
sign their contracts for the fall
term, they will be asked $40
additional. The entire $75 will

,be subtracted from their non-

academic invoice when it is paid
in the Fall.

This will be a continuous pro-r
cess. Each April the student will-

pay $75 and each fall it -will be
substracted from ‘her
demic invoice.

Good Faith

This is done in good faith by
the student who is telling» the
University that she intends to live
on the campus in the fall. This
will prevent a raise in dorm fees
which generally occurs when stu-
dents applying to several colleges
break their contract with the Uni-
versity.

When students notify the Uni-
versity that theywill be register-
ing and then fail to do so, this
usually causes an excess of many
rooms and the cost is made up by
the students.

If damage does occur now, it
will be registered with Miss
Skewis and women will not be
able to register again until dam-
age is paid for.

Heads for

By KATHIE EDWARDS
“Fire them at me,” demand-
ed Ronald Georgescu, a poised
and charming young man
with large brown eyes and a
thatch of shiny black hair
tumbling over his forehead,‘
as he was being questioned about

his latest accomplishments in the
ﬁeld of drama.

Ron graduated from the Uni-
versity last December and is pre-
sently playing the romantic lead
in Fantastics, an original musical
play by Tom Jones and Harvey
Schmidt now being performed at
the’ Pittsburgh Playhouse.
Originally Psych Major

Originally planning to be a psy-
chology major, Ron entered the
University after graduating from

in Latrobe. The ‘trimester plan
appealed to him because he had
so much schooling‘ ahead of him.
Once here, however, Ron de-
cided to change his major to
English and has written several
original plays. When asked why
he didn’t'major in drama since
he plans on a career in the
theatre, Ron pointed out that he
wanted a Liberal Arts education

' first. A

“I don’t think a person at 18
really knows where he’s going,
especially in acting. He should
have some practical experience
first. He should know what acting
is all about, before entering into
extensive courses in drama.”
Yale "Drama School Goal

‘Now that Ron has gotten his
Lilgeral AFLS degree, he is plan-
hing to enter the School of Drama
at Yale in September. His work
there will require three years for
completion. Conditions in the
school, he said, are very similar
to the New York stage, and the
student is allowed to leave at any

legitimate theatre. .

No stranger to avid Play-
house patrons, Ron has been ap-
pearing in productions there for
tvwoiyears. His first role was in
Little Mary Sunshine. Since
then, he has appeared in Mac-
beth, Okay» and The Pied Piper
of Hamlin, which was also fea-_‘
tured on KDKA-TV. '

Here at the University, Ron was
a member of the original Pitt
Players, where“he played the lead
role in The Boyfriend. He has also
appeared in numerous productions
at St. Vincent’s. _

Shows Versatility

In Fantasticks, which -has been
running for three years in New
York City at the Sullivan Theatre
oil’-Broadway, he shows off his
talent for singing and dancing, as
well as acting. He began taking
voice lessons ﬁve weeks ago, but
has had no other lessons, he said.
“I just picked it" up doing shows,
I guess.”

When Fantasticks closes in
Pittsburgh, Ron intends to do
some TV commercials in New
York and work in summer stock
until he enters Yale in the fall.

With a. strong sense of pride
tempered with humility, Ron feels
that “the most poignant thing
about acting is being able to po_r-

ience to the audience as well.”

“Acting is just living,” he con-
tinued. “Look at Fantasticks. It’s
great comedy, and yet it’s very
tender and moving. It’s an inti-
mate kind of show, where the
actors have a close contact with
the audience. That’s what gives it
life. In fact, it’s that close rapport
between audience and actor that
gives any good show life,” he con-
cluded.

Party Time

Student Government elections will soon be upon us‘
again and it is hoped that this subject will be given a bit
more consideration than it has received in the past.

Last year the voters showed a marked lack of interest

. ‘’'"in the organization, -.even though an important referendum

was being considered on one occasion which called for the
abolishment of the body. It was narrowly saved, however,
and a new regime was established which has proven itself
an effective force on this campus. . '

At least two students will be actively seeking the presi-
dential post this year. This is a rarity in itself and a wel-
come one, as too often in the past,'no more than one -candi-
date could be found. We have already heard of mutterings
of campaign tactics and that competition will be high.

The re-establishment of “political parties” is also being
rumored. These groups, often tagged with extraordinarily

V f~idea1istic"names, generally serve no other purpose than the

promotion of favorite sons for the top posts in SG. After

the election, these parties disband with amazing speed, re-‘

gardless of success or failure.

Toooften in the past, however, the structure of the
“party” and its platform has drawn the attention away from
theindividual seeking office. Last year the parties achieved
some purpose but the memory ofprevious years in which
these makeshift groups made noise leaves a stigma on them
which is hard to erase. The election of a mock dark-horse
candidate — a true blemish on the University’s student
political past — was the most overt indication of the general
falsity of the party system.

The idea of two or more candidates seriously seeking
the presidency of SG, accompanied by running-mates for
the other executive oflices, is welcomed, but the re-estab-
lishment of the parti.es is not. These organizations have con-
tinually given SG a blackeye which it does not deserve and
have often hampered the right man from being elected to
the right oﬂice. Too often, students have become engross-
ed with the idea of “playing politics“ when they should be
concerned about running a student legislative body.

Let us watch the growth of student politics in the near-
ing campaign. And as we begin to weigh the candidates, let
us hope that the party system will -not develop to again
harm, hamper and ridicule SG.

The Lost Art

,There has been a resurgence in the old question
of whether or not the City ‘of Pittsburgh is ar-
tistically dead, a question as old as the three
rivers themselves. As a matter of fact, there has
been considerable doubt that 
Pittsburgh ever had any cul— *
tured breath in its sooty respira-
tory system. But few American
cities can, as cities, boast a his-.
tory of art. This is understand-
able, as America simply hasn’t
been around that long and art
apparently cannot be whipped
up at the same pace of technol-‘ '
ogy and industry. _

We are more concerned, however, with the pres-
ent _state of the various art forms in Steeltown. As
a city which, as some of. most prominent citizens
propose, may one day claim education as its largest
industry, it is felt that Pittsburgh rightfully should
be fostering the arts withdynamic zeal.

Predictably, such-is not the case. Inga recent
move to “economize,” Mayor Joseph M. Barr cold-

ly dropped the Pittsburgh Symphony,- Carnegie '

Museum, the Three Rivers‘ Arts Festival and other
cultural organizations from its list of recipients of
municipal monies. ’ A

Like. Too Mcmv Others '

Pittsburgh, like too many other cities in- this
country, has had great diﬂiculty. in supporting, its
musical and art centers inrecent years. With the
announcement of the Mayor’s budget-trimmings,
the Symphony and others choked forth their cries
of disbelief and dispair.,Some private citizens also
complainedf most were busy watching the hockey
scores, however. , / ‘

For if Pittsburgh is not an art-mindedtown,

it certainly is a sports—minded one. The City is _‘

proud of its baseball team. and, after several years
of strong ﬁnancial support of a cellar—squatter, it
pushed the team into a World Series Champion-
ship with admirable spirit. Football interest has
been divided here between the professional Steel-
ers and our own Panthers, -but neither team has
gone hungry. College basketball has also enjoyed
popularity here, as well as hockey. "A

The town’s sports—mania is best exempliﬁed by
the recent erection of the Hill District’s Civic.._.Arena.
One wonders just how “civic” j this admittedly
beautiful, mechanical—roofed structu're’is,,when one
remembers that the Arena was built ostensibly to
house The Civic Light. Onem and similar compan-
ies.

 

By Matthew Nesvisky

It has only taken one season to show that the
Big Dome is inadequate for theatre presentation.
The acoustics there are hideous and the seating
arrangement reduces the stage totelevision screen
proportion. The Light Opera, which was forced “to
pound the boards at Pitt Stadium and the steamy
Melody Tent in the past, reported a loss on its
regular season last year at the Arena and is con-\
sidering looking for a new home.

The Arena, accordingly, has been found to be
an excellent barnyard for basketball, hockey -and
boxing and is, of course, ample reason for John Q.
Pittsburgh to stamp his feet and brandish his pop-
corn box in glee. .

On top of all this, the City has given its bles-
sings on the proposedconstruction of a new sports
stadium on the Northside, Pittsburgh’~s Hobo
Jungle. This announcement came about the same
time as the one concerning the cutting of the aid
’to our music and art centers.

The City admits that itcannot afford to ﬁnance
the proposed stadium, but in the sa.me breath,
recognizes the fact that Pittsburgh cannot survive
without “big league sports.” As" is custom, the
Mayor has become embroiled with the County and

State governments overlthe ﬁnancing -of the ball-

park. At the same time, the local culture groups
have been forced to appeal to these same govern-
ments for» aid- Their chances are as slim as the
stadium’s chances are fat.
Not Even A Half

It appears ‘then that the: City as government
doesn’t give a boot and a half for the ﬁner things
in life. This is a sad note, for a growing element of
people’hére*are supporting culture. The idea of the
Three Riv rs Arts Festival has been enthusiastical-
ly received by participants and audience alike. At-
tendance is up at the Symphony, even though
Steinberg has been forced to offer various discount
rate plans in order to secure season subscriptions.
Carnegie Museum’s art galleries, while rather
starved for good pieces in its permanent collection,

has had success with several recent “road shows.”
Foreign ﬁlm theatres are ﬂourishing here and a

new espresso-ﬂavored movie house is under con-
struction. Concert tours are multiplying. v

' -- The growing element does, indeed, have a -thirst
for the arts in this City. But unless they band to-
gether to make themselves heard, they will be out-
shouted by the average Pittsburgher’s sporting

 Qualms Over Cuba . .'

Thorn in

Our Side

By far the most volatile issue in American for-
eign policy today is what is commonly termed the
“Cuban Affair.” ' This sunny Caribbean island,
ninety miles from o_ur shores, has caused more
more hysteria, more ‘
ﬂag-waving oration, more un.jus- v
tiﬁed and irresponsible speeches,
and more battle fever than any

nant and most painful thorn in
the side of the American, public.

But of greater magnitude
than all of the symptomatic hys-
terics is the root of the disease A
Cuba represents, and the_traged_ies it has caused.

Cuba is a bastion of Communist imperialism in
the Western hemisphere, and in this. respect it is
offensive to us, like the smell of a skunk.. But the
disease Cuba represents_is not solely its Commu-
nist government and ties to Moscow; it is also the
representation of acute paranoia thrust upon the
American people.’ The FEAR of this island, /its now

‘limited weaponry, and the men‘ that run it ‘causes

men to make rash, reckless moves. It causes Sena-
tor Scott of Pennsylvania to conceive of a “plot”
between Kennedy and Khrushchev. It causes other
Congressmen to state that “sources” have revealed
to them that there are missiles hidden in Cuba.
It induces the "press of this nation to cover page
after page with news, features, and editorials on
Cuba. -
Go On Frothing

Almost all of these complainers want to “do
something about Cuba.” When asked, for speciﬁcs.
most back down. But they do not publicize their
retreats from this speciﬁc question: “Do you want
to invade Cuba now?” Rather they go on frothing
at the mouth, even after an exhaustive, precedent-

   

 

By Jim Kleinberg

setting brieﬁng by Secretary of Defense’ McNamara. ‘-

What is America’s response? Why, to arms, to
arms! ..

'The tragedy of Cuba is manifold. First, the
Cuban problem, as it is today, represents a failure
on the part of American strategy. We held onto
the safe relationship with Batista until the bonds
were forcibly broken. We denied, our own self-
righteous claims to democracy and liberty by deal-
ing with the Batistas and Trujillos of the Carib-
bean. We are now paying. the price in measures‘.

of anti-Americanism, the rise of Communism, and’
the slowdown of our aid programs.

Second, the Cuban Affair has diverted the at-
tention of our nation and its leaders from other
spots on the globe where policy and. action are
needed.

Fear Limits Diplomacy '

Third, our ﬁeld of diplomacy has been severely
limited by our fear over Cuba. We have centered
so much concern on this island that we really are
down to three basic policies: one, forget about it
(clearly ridiculous); two, invade (at high cost);
and three, watch it carefully (present policy).

Finally, there is the tragedy that Cuba might
cause. This would be an invasion at the present
time. For Cuba, holding only __the small weapons
described by McNamara, is not a military threat to
us, or any other Latin American nation as long as
we survey it closely and constantly. To avenge the
insults heaped on us by Castro’s words and very
presence; to vent the frustration of the Cold War on
Cuba; to let our emotions run away with us — these

would be pitifully poor reasons to send Americans '':'~«

to their death. Latin America could not applaud
such an act; nor could our NATO allies. The only
man to smack his lips with joy in the long run

would be Nikita Khrushche in:the  em]? ‘

By. FREDA KELLAMS

Monday night my friend and ‘I
arrived in front of Brackenridge,
books tucked under our arms, be-
gan saying goodnight. We were
laughing —— some secret joke like
always
share. Had a kind ‘of “life is
good” feeling -—- grateful for
warmth; friendship, educational
opportunity,. for knowing each
other. I

But alas! sweet normalcy is"al-

ways cut short, at_ least at Pitt»

it is, at" least in Pittsburgh. Cut
short’ by walking Pitt Provincial-
ism-in school jackets and crew
cuts. Cut like a knife thrown by
an idiot-child, these faceless ‘‘stu-
dents]? these courageous “Ameri-
cans leveled their hatred at us.

“Nigger! Yaah, I’d kill him.”
Their backs were turned. I
wouldn’t afford them the satis-
faction of looking up to identify
their backs. They were in a group
-—- remarks are safe then. I re-
membered Matt. Swetonic’s arti-
cle in The Pitt News about some
obnoxious characters disrupting
the viewing of a movie in Holland
Hall — members of the Univer-
sity family.

Aha! I thought, the same type
of creature. Masked, bunched,
cowardly, worse than that, lack-
ing in any conceptions of the
most basic truths concerning hu-

man decency.

And I ask them, whoever they
are, the members of this face-
less crew, how can they live with
their own selves. What gives them
the white right of indecency, to

' violate the autonomy of their fel-

low creatures? I ask them why
they hide? I ask why they stare?

I would meet them face to face,
but would they meet me? I ask
them what in God’s name they
are doing at Pitt, walking defile-
ments of all that a, university
education should mean? I cringe
— I see visions of potential Mc-
Carthyites. I see empirical evi-
dence of a subtle,’ unorganized,
and therefore more insidious -Ku
Klux Klan, and I see it at Pitt.

I ask more. Why is it that peo-
ple in authority in this Univer-
sity, not to speak of the country
as a whole, do not speak out
against what they must realize
to be one of the chief, if not the
number one problem in this coun-
try, that is the prejudice and
coldness practiced by so—called
“solid American citizens” against
the? Negro. . .

Domthey not see how blatant

   

stares in street and restaurant,
how crude remarks, how nervous
aversions, are indicative of ‘fes-
tering prejudice anr fear, — and
on the part of students yet.

What is the spectre” they see?
A Negro man and a white girl
together? The lack of a strong and
open stand by people in positions
of authority, the provincialism
and downright ﬂagrancy‘ at ‘Pitt
is pitiable, deplorable.

It all helps weave an atmos-
phere of alienation, alienation of
the American Negro, alienation of
all. who would lead their own
lives their own way, alienation
of the foreign student in this

country, and the grossest denial '

of all human, liberal and sup-
posedly American values. '
I am asking why. I am asking
why Dean Rush does not include
a , convincing statement to all
freshmen women during orienta-

tion concerning America’s chief,

problems and the.University com-
munity’s role in meeting them.
She has great moral "authority.
An honest word from her carries
weight. Why not more explicit

words concerning A basic human .

dignity to the Negro?

._Penn State Opposition For
0 Wrestlers in Season Finale

for Johnson

Pound Bout

faces Penn State Saturday at

The grapplers now own a 4-3 record. They have only lost.
three times once since 1951 and that time, in 1961, they won

- chairman of the NCAA committee‘

six. The maximum number
wins they can have this year is
five, since Saturday’s match is
the season finale.

Penn State is not having one of
its better years either. The Lions
stand at 4-3, but to their credit is
the fact that they have given
Syracuse its toughest match of the
season. The Orange defeated Penn
State, 17-11, last Saturday.

Ready to Go _

The match against Syracuse
showed that the Lions will be
ready to give the Panthers a tough
battle. ‘ .

Their 130-p o u n d e r, Bob
Haney, defeated Syracuse's
Bethe] Greenhalgh, 8-5. Green-
halgh tied Mike Johnson, so this
should be Johnson’s toughest
match. _

George Edwards,’ who handles
the 157-pound spot for Penn State,
is one of the best in the East in
that position. He beat Daryl Kel-
vington in dual-meet action last
year.

At 177 and 191-pounds the
Lions’ have a duo that could give
their Panther counterparts, Lee
Hall and Kenn Barr plenty of
trc ‘Jle.

Mike Gill, the 177-pounder,

of‘?

drew with Syracuse’s Lew Rob-

erts, who beat Hall. Ed Pohland -

has.ranked with the best in the
‘East in the 191-pound class for
the last two years.

Heavyweight Dick Walker
pinned Jeff Ware last year, so the
Lions could mean trouble for the
Panthers, in what should be an
extremely close match.

Peery plans no change in his
lineup that lost to Lehigh, except
the return to action of 123-pound-
er Tom Heniff, who is over a knee
injury. '

Frank ‘O’Korn drew praise
from the coach with his per-
formance against Lehigh. “With
O’Korn at 137 we have our‘
strongest team. He’s looked real
good his last two matches and
looks like he may do something
in Easterns.” .

Johnson and Jim Harrison will
be out to end the season with un-
beaten records. These ‘two how-
ever, have been just about the
only bright spots for the Panthers.

A win Saturday would at least
keep the wrestlers above the .500
mark and getithemlin winning
form ‘for the Eastern champion-
ships, two weeks hence. '

Ohio University challenges the 7-1 record of the Panther

“Overall, we will be stronger

this year than last.”

“Any Ohio school, small or
large, is always hard to beat in
swimming,” Coach Ben Grady
said.

Chrysler Returns

,Returning from last year’s
squad is Bob Chrysler, defending
Mid-American Conference 440-
yard champion, and Bob Wallsten,
who ﬁnished second in the con-
ference diving competition.

The Panthers’ Steve Ganong,
however, beat Chrysler twice’

Ganong is not even the fastest

coach.

Ron Levine won the 200-yard

this winter. His brother Rob com-
pleted the 200-yard backstroke in
2110.1 last year. which was a
school record then. Rob was
clocked in 2:O4.8 against Bucknell
this season.

Last year the Panthers won

’ both relays. They were timed at

Track Team After
‘Second Triumph
Against Kent State

Carl Rees’ track team hosts
Kent State on Saturday in an at-

. tempt to better a 1-1 record.

The track team had few bright
spots in the meet with Maryland
and Navy at Annapolis. Maryland
had 75 points, Navy 39, and the
Panthers, 12.

John Bailey ran the two mile
in 9:36, the best time by .a
Panther trackman in the last six
years. but still only ﬁnished
third.

Vance Carter, key man in the
440 and 880 relay, didn't make the
trip, and Joe Friend, star hurdles
man, didn't compete because of an
injury.

The track team will be count-
mg on Ron Weiers in the pole
vault. Rees was "pleased with his
.14-foot vault. “If not for a miss,
he would have tied for second,”
he said.

The freshmen will meet Kent
State’s frosh Saturday.

Cymnasts Visit

Penn State In
Last Dual Meet

The Penn State Nittany
Lions, holding second place in
the Eastern Gymnastics
League, will host the Panther
gymnasts Saturday at Univer-
sity Park. The meet will con-
clude the season for the Cats, who
are having their worst season un-
der C o a _c h Warrerr Neiger’s
regime. .

Paced by Tom Seward who is

regarded as the best ‘in the East,

in free’ exercise and George Wil-
liams, an ace still-rings perform-
er, the Lions have clawed their
way to a 4-1 record, losing only
to unbeaten Syracuse.

Other Penn State leaders are
Ray Cherry on the side horse,
F. P. Sforza on the long horse,
John Bruning on the horizontal
bar and Gene Harlacher on the
parallels. A

The Lions, however, are injury-
ridden, a factor which may help
the Panthers. Williams has a torn
muscle in his right arm which
makes it difficult for him to per-
form the hold positions in his
still rings specialty. Several sub-
stitutes are also injured.

The Panthers, now 1-4-1, will
close the regular’ season. It will
be the last dual meet for seniors
Jack Lehner, Ed Zamecnik, and
Bob Pingatore. These three men

posted most of the Panther in-
dividual victories this year and
will be the key men in. the effor
to upset_the_Li_ons. . . . ‘

   

 

Penn State Foe

The r e s u l t s of tonight’s

and Saturday’s contest with.
Penn State are the last two

question marks to the Pan-

thers’ post-season . plans.

Coach Bob Timmons’ club has
already received an invitation
from the National
Tournament at New York, and a
feeler from the NCAA committee.

Penn State athletic director
Ernie McCoy, who is‘ also the

 

ready accepted an NIT bid.
Common Foes

Penn State’s performance at
home tonight against .West Vir-
ginia, a recent Panther victim,
will also count.

A r m y coach George Hunter,
another member of the NCAA
selection committee, said Sat-
urday after his team lost to
Penn State, 75-68: “I believe

but I will vote for the team that
wins Saturday.”

The Panthers meanwhile
swamped the Lions, 68-48, at Rec
Hall in December. The Lions have
only lost twice since and now
have a_ 14-3 mark. '

Temple Judge ,

Tonight’s game in the Phila-
delphia ‘Palestra is also important
for Pitt, because Temple c’oa ch

on the dial, will carry ..tonight’s
game beginning at _7 p.m. Coach

The Panthers seek to improve
their‘16-4 record. The Owls are

Yes — the big thing.

3; You’re going to have kids—so
you’ll want maternity benefits.

I’d like" lots of children.

 

5. And you’re not going to wantto
work all your life, are you?
You’re going to want to take it
easy 7 you know, travel around,
live it up. So you need a
retirement plan that guarantees
you plenty of dough.

I can see it now.

 

 

   

 

 

2. You have to consider your needs.
You’re going to get married some
day, aren’t you? Then you need
life and accident insurance.

Go on— go on-

4. And what about medical bills?
That’s something every big
family has to think about. You
need a good major medicallplan
that covers almost everything.

‘ You’re right — you’re rightl

 

- 6. That's why I say you have to
look at the fringe beneﬁts when
you look fora job.

But don't you also have to
look for interesting work,
good income, the chance
for advancement?

7. You sure do. That's why I'm
going to work for Equitable. You
get all those job advantages-
and all the fringe benefits, too.
