   

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The Panthers struck quickly and skillfully for two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s game
against Penn State to sieze a precious victory 14-13, from
the jaws of defeat.

Quarterback Bill Kaliden. Fullback Fred Riddle, and
Guard Nort Seaman, whose extra point conversion
swung the decision in the locals’ favor, were prominent
in the winning close—out of the home season. But indi-
viduals were not responsible for the thrilling victory
over the Nittany Lions. ‘ /

It was a rousing display of team cohesiveness, in the _

ﬁnal stanza, that snapped the Blue and Gold's four
game losing string. Prodded by a rooting section which
roared and howled its chagrin after State had scored
its second touchdown, late in the third period, the
Panthers came alive, with vigor. They ‘pocketed the en-
suing kickoff and rolled 74 yards withgll plays into the
Lions’ endzone for their initial tally. It came after two
minutes had elapsed in the ﬁnal quarter.

The’ spark of cooperation did not go out, following the

 

.p.....;..... Squeeze ByStutc,

tionless after the kickoff, recaptured the oﬁensive and
scored about four minutes later, via “air mail.” This set
the stage for Seaman to show his storied kicking prowess
with the extra point attempt. His first try was good, but
the Panthers had too many men in the backfield.

The second boot was from the 14 yard line, but the
added distance proved no obstacle for the taciturn line-
man, who was born in Calcutta, India. His kick was
straight, deep, and, best of all, good for the point and
the hairs breadth triumph. It was Seaman’s first con-
version in two tries this campaign. ‘

Until this late surge by the men of Skyscraper U., the
gridders from Mt. Nitanny had the situation under con-
trol agxd were coasting’ toward win number seven. They
had played the first half with the same lackluster var-
iety of mechanical ball which the Panthers employed.
They did distinguish themselves, however, by scoring a i
touchdown.

The Lions took the ball, late in the second quarter, on
their own 42 yard line. Quarterback Al Jacks passed to
Fullback Maury Schleicher for 43 yards to the Panther

threw a fourth down touchdown pass to End Ron Markie-
wicz. The play started as an end run, from a handoif,
but Caye was caught in his backﬁeld and .choveled the
ball at Markiewicz in desperation. Emil Caprara con-
verted.

State made it 13-0 in the third quarter on a nine yard

pass from Jacks to End Paul North. Caprara missed the
point, but at that time it didn’t seem to matter.
I Then the Panther, at last. bared his fangs. Dick
Haley took the kickoff and the Blue and Gold were
rolling. Eleven plays later Riddle, who led all ground
gainers with 75 yards traveled, cracked over from the
two. Ivan Toncic converted.

Two I/ninutes later, the locals were in possession again
and clicking. Halfback Andy Sepsi provided the impor-
tant initial impetus with a 13 yard dash around end. The_
Blue and Gold plowed slowly down the State 45, where
on first down, Kaliden passed. The Lions were caught off
guard by this radical departure from form and End
Dick Scherer was all alone on the 25 yard. line with an
empty field in front of him. He took the ﬁne areal in

Pitt Chest Chairman Answers

Negative Remarks on Pro

gram

In an interview with the Pitt News, Pitt Chest Chairman,
Gene Klein, Bus. Ad. ’59, has remarked on the negative com-
ments issuing from various places. In particular, a column
and a letter to the editor in the Pitt News were discussed.

First, according to Klein,

the purpose of sending enve-

lopes and brochure before the campaign was to educate be-

forehand, thus eliminating anye

“high pressure tactics.” This has
been construed to just the op-
posite. ,

All the envelopes were to be
returned ‘during the class hour
solicitation in order to save time
and money. In this manner, none
of the individuals who declined
to give were to be contacted again,
a much more efficient plan than
had been used in previous years.

Envelopes Not Returned
Many students failed to return
their envelopes, however, thus
nullifying any gains to be had in
this part of the program.

Far from trying to coerce any-
one to _give then, stated Klein,
the purpose of having the “re-
fusal”. on the envelope was to
expedite matters for the com-
mittee. _ . .

The committee's word choice
may have been faulty and they

I apologize, but they do not believe

that the one word should have
made a great diiference in the
attitude of anyone willing to give.

Jobs, Groups Vie
For Attention of
Dr. Swartzbaugh

By .ROSALIE GLAND

In the short ﬁve months
that he has been at Pitt, Dr.
William Swartzbaugh has
-lived up to the recommenda-
-tion given him by Dr. Charles
‘Peake concerning his ap-
‘pointment as director of the Stu-
dent Union. , E L

In announcing the appointment,
Dr. Peake remarked, “By train-
-ing and experience, he is unusual-

.ly well-qualiﬁed for the position.’

His doctoral studies have been in
the area of student personnel and
the program at the Ohio State
‘Student Union under his leader-
ship has attracted widespread in-
terest.”
V A tall, slim young man with
warm blue eyes, Dr. Swartzbaugh
shows surprised modesty at the
mention of his accomplishments
thus far.
' Duties Numerous
His duties are vague, undeﬁn-
able, and many. In this position
as director, he is responsible for
the general supervision and ad-
ministration of all aspects of the
Union.
Speciﬁcally, he is coordinator
of the Midday Series, works
chsely with University organi-
zations in the planning of
events, programs, and policies.
He also cooperates with the
maintenance and food services.
Dr. Swartzbaugh expressed sat-
isfaction over the progress and
popularity of the Midday Series.
An indication of its success was
the near capacity audience who
heard Dr. Fackenheim’s lecture on
“Existentialism” at Stephen Fos-
ter Auditorium last Thursday.
The average attendance at the
programs is two hundred.
Resides in Allison Park
Claiming Toledo, Ohio, as his
hometown, Dr. Swartzbaugh now
resides with his wife and three
children in Allison Park. A pic-
ture of his children, Billy, 9,
Jimmy, 3, and Jan, 5, occupies a
position of honor in his bpokcase.
Dr. Swartzbaugh received his
Bachelor of Arts degree at
Dartmouth where he completed
a modiﬁed major in psychology
with minors in sociology, En-
glish, and mathematics.

It seems like days but it is really close to a year since

the Pitt.,News carried the banner, “Students To Get Free

_ By David Breialtstone

It was a warm evening for November and the
windows ‘of the room were partly open. Several
boys were sitting on the ﬂoor ﬁnishing off ham-
burgers and coffee which had come from the White
Tower across the street. A couple of the fellows‘
were taking the last puffs on their cigarettes and’
preparing to get back to their
own rooms. ’ .
' Abruptly someone noticed that
a cardboard cup, which had
served as an ashtray, was
smouldering. In an instant it was
aﬂame and ‘everyone jumped up.
The wastebasket, ‘at eleven
o’c,lock, was stuffed full and the
bathroom was too far down the
hall. Couldn’t leave it on the
ﬂoor to stamp it out, either, for
the good carpeting would get
damaged. ‘ v ’ ,

They had to do something quickly to avoid ca-
tastrophe and they did. Someone scooped up the
small ﬁreball and tossed it out the window. The
burning missile landed on the ﬁrst story roof and
the dorm students, at the sixth ﬂoor window,
watched it go out. Unfortunately,'or fortunately as
the viewpoint dictates, a University patrolman saw
the ﬁrebrand drop from the building and noted the
sixth ﬂoor window.

Culprits Caught

He went to the correct room,.admonished the
occupants, ﬁled his report, and the incident ap-
peared extinguished. Lieutenant Charles Ray, head
of the University Police, later q’uestioned his offi-
cer about the affair and then sent a letter of cau-
tion to‘ Dr. Charles’ Peake, assistant chancellor for
student affairs. ‘

A copy of that letter found its way to the Pitt
News and last Wednesday an editorial titled, “Dorm
Delinquents,” appeared in the paper. The editorial
blew the roof off the Schenley House dorm, and its
inhabitants, and resident supervisors were amazed."
For until the News appeared no one had any idea
that a complaint about the dormitory was going to»
be made or why." '

From Lt. Ray’s letter, the News quoted the con-
dition of the room as being such that “they (the
police) ‘did not expect a dog to sleep in such~a
place.” In addition, these conditions constituted

l

 

were added editorial comments about a rather
vacuous opinion from an unidentiﬁed, sclf-ap-

pointed dorm inspector, and a passing remark about 

missing elevator buttons.

' Comfort. Not Sterlity

The charges were damagingly stated, but sadly
unwarranted. At fault, no doubt, were these alleged
foul conditions ‘reported by the police. The fire-

_ brand accidentewas regrettable, but none the \less

an accident. However, if unmade beds, a full waste-
basket, and open windows can be termed “health
and ﬁre hazards,” then the boys were guilty. Not
only are these fellows guilty, but most of the dorm
is guilty. Comfort, college style, has never been

equated with “Aunt Mary” tidiness, to’the last?

particle of dust, and should not be.

Moreover“,»the general condition of the dormitory,
housekeeping—wise, is good, if not perfect. It a
comparison could be made with other dormitory

proorns across the country, I feel certain that ours

would take a back seat to few in terms of livability.
I, personally, ave seen college rooms which looked
as if they had been ransasked by a horde of the
original European Vandals and the local authorities
appeared unperturbed. These rooms might well
have been classiﬁed as objectionable; ours could
never.be. T

The Schenley ‘House boys, generally, take justi-
ﬁable pride in their palatial quarters and do a good
job of looking after their own, rooms. Other minor

offenses, undeniably, have occurred. The oﬁicial,

language used in the controversial letter however,
was dubiously chosen.
‘Call for Intelligence

The general lack of adult communication which
marked this incident has been characteristic in the
dormitory situation. The resident faculty member

letter was sent to Dr. Peake. Accurate documenta-
tion was, thus, impossible. Additionally, the embry-
onic self-government plan at Schenley House has
been hampered by the usual administrative red
tape. So naturally, they were not adviseﬁd about the
“crime,” since they have no official status.

Nothing has occurred at the dormitory, includ-
ing the apocryphal swiping of elevator ﬂoor buttons
by residents, to warrant the denial of a coordinated
governing body. In an atmosphere free of
“watchers” and exaggerated tales about living con-
ditions, in an atmosphere of effective self-govern-

The most recent flare-up in
the troubled Middle East Area
is the drive by Egypt and Syria
to unseat King Hussein of Jor-
don.

A l t h o u g h
Jordon n a

 

it has great
signiﬁcance in
its effect on
world politics
The kingdom is ,
a state that‘
was established .
by the British
at the end of
World. War, I

for the expressed purpose of
assuring Britain that its political
and military power would be
maintained in the Middle East.

In actuality, Jordon is an
artiﬁcial ,sta.te that depends for
its economic existence on sub-
sidies frommother countries.

From the period since World
War I to the end of last year,
Britain sﬁpported the country
and assured relative peace in the
Arab world concerning the ques-
tion of Jordon’s sovereignity.

Last fear, since the Jordanian
government rid itself of British
influence in its army and gov-
ernment, it has become the cen-
ter of concern among the Arab
states, because this nation‘s eco-
nomic income is not assured.

Neither of the Arab nations
wishes to see this country fall
under the influence of any other
Arab state; thus this constant
tension exists which is main-
’/tained as Jordon continues in its
economic tottering.

Three weeks ago Egypt
through Cairo Radio started a
campaign that was directed en-
tirely against «King . Hussein and

 

T his propoganda move lpro- -

gressed rapidly when Syria
threw its support against Hus-
sein. Through the radio and
press of these two countries,
they kept up a constant barage
of condemnation against‘ King
Hussein directed to his people.
Jordas In Danger

The Jordainian government

‘and particularly Hussein ‘were

in immediate danger. Iraq and
Saudia Arabia, sensing the bal-
ance of power shifting to the
side of Nasser, tried to stop this
tirade of propoganda by using
their political and diplomatic
power to ﬁnd a solution.,

It was two weeks ago that
Nasser changed his “Unseat-
Hussein” campaign to a more
drastic “Assassinate Hussein.”
This attack against the king was
directed primarily to arouse the
one-million Palestinian refugees

who were affected by the Israeli- I

Arab War of .1948. _
Nasser charged the King with
conspiring ?in secret with Israel
to settle the refugee problem.
The accusation of a secret settle-
ment between Jordon and Israel
was the, most effective charge
that Nasser could have used to
arouse the ire of -the’ Palestinian
refugees, composing two thirds
of the population of Jordon,
against the rule "of King“Hfus-
sein. _ , , .
This charge on the part of
Egypt and Syria made Iraq’ and

Suadia Arabia realize, that 'Nas- .

ser must be stopped ‘and the

Jordanian government must‘ be’

supported.

Both countries offered econo-
mic, assistance that would help
maintain the sovereignty of Jor-
don and offered verbal help in

support of the present Jordanian. A

government systeirn.

that Egypt and Syria suddenly
decided to relinquish their at-
tacks on the Hashemite King-
dom. It was on November 18
that the Egyptian press stopped
asking the Jordanian people to
“clear the situation” by assasin-
ating their Monarch.
Assasination Asked ,
What has been the results?

First, the one million Palesti-.

nians who are constantly in a
state of_. irate tension were
“aroused even further by the
charge of Nasser that Hussein
was negotiating a settlement
with Israel.

Secondly, it has been noted
by observers in Amman that the
opposition to the King has be-
come bolder since the beginning
of Nasser’s attacks. King Hus-
sein has‘ found it necessary to
tighten. even more his previously
strict martial law placed on the
country in April._ _

, Finally, Iraq” and Saudia
Arabia have ‘committed them-
selves to the existence of Jordon
further than it iswwise to con-

tinue to maintain "unity in ,t.he\‘,

5 HOW TO STUDY.

The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes have bought this
space so I can bring a message of importance to American
undergra<luai:es each week. There is no more important
niessage I can bring you than this: College can be beauti-
ful. Don’t louse it up with st,-udying._ — «

That was my mistake. At first, cowed by college,
I studied ‘so much that I turned into a dreary, blinking
creature, subject to dry mouth and night sweats. This
dismal condition prevailed until I learned the real mean-
ing of college. And what is that‘? I’ll tell you what: tg
prepare you to face the realities of the world. And what
do you need to face the realities of the world‘? I’ll tell you
what: poise. And how do you get poise? I.’ll tell you how:
not by sticking your nose in a’ book, you may be sure!

Relax! Live! "Enjoy! . . . That’s how you get poise.
Of course you have to study, but be poised about it.
Don’t be like some drones who spend every single night
buried in a book. They are not learning poise; what's
more, they are playing hob with their posture.

The truly poised student knows better than to make
the whole semester hideous with studying. He knows that
the night before an exam is plenty of time to study. ’

Yes, I’ve heard people condemn cramming. But who
are these people? They are the electric light and power
intere.sts, that’s who! They want you to sit up late and
study every night so you will use more electricity and

‘ enrich their bulging coffers.

Don’t be ta.ken in by their insidious propaganda!
Cramming is clearly the only sensible way to study. But
beware! Even cramming can be overdone. When you
cram, be sure you are good and relaxed. Before you start,
eat a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat
another hearty dinner. Then go park some place and light
up a Marlboro. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it aiiords.
Don’t go home till you’re properly relaxed.

 

Once at home, stay relaxed. Do not, however, fall

asleep. This is too relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose ’

achair that is not too comfortable. For example, take“
a Cll2tlr_l7\’lt<ll nails pointing up through the seat.
Place several packs of Marlboros within easy reach.

Good, mild tobaccohelps you relax, and that’s what

Marlboro is-—good, mild tobacco. But Marlboro is more
than just good, mild tobacco; it is also cigarette paper
to keep the good, mild tobacco from spilling all over the

place. And a ﬁlter. And a flip—top box. And a red -tape -

to lift the cigarettes easily . . . It is, in short, a lot to like.

Now you’ve got the uncomfortable chair and the
Marlboros. Now you need light. Use the lit end of your
Marlboro. Do not enrich the light and power interests.

Read your textbook in a slow, relaxed manner. Do
not underline; it reduces the resale value of the book.

Always keep your books in prime resale condition. You

never know when you’ll need getaway money.

As you read you will no doubt come across many.
things you don’t understand. But don’t panic. Relax."
Play some Fats Domino. Remove a callus. ,}o out and
catch some night crawlers. ‘

Relax! Live! Enjoy! Remember-any numbgr of

people have bachelor’s degrees, but precious few havepoise ! -

Panthers Fighting
Long Uphill Battle

' By ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

 

Student support can go a long, long way. Although two other 4

pep rallies were held this year,‘ only the rally and bond ﬁre held last
Friday evening proved to be the success of the year. The reason be-
ing the 14-13 Panther victory over State on Saturday afternoon.

At ﬁrst it seemed as if the Panthers were playing their usual
losing game with the score 7-0 at the half in favor of Penn State.
Because of the poor showing by the Jungle Cats in the ﬁrst half,
State followers were already planning for their post season trip to

~( the Southland. The Panther rooters in turn were wondering whether»

or not the pep rally the night before was worth the effort.

, Nothing seemed to go right for the Blue and Gold. Their

" tackling hit a new low. On numerous occasions, Richie Lucas and
Al Jacks were trapped in their backﬁeld but the Panther tacklers
were just brushed aside easily and the passes were thrown or the
runs made. One excuse for this may have been that there weren’t
any scrimmage sessions the past week due to the number of in-
Juries.

Then too, the breaks were against the Jungle Cats in the ﬁrst
rolling dead on the two yard line while the second hit on the two,
half. In the ﬁrst quarter alone, Lucas punted twice with the ﬁrst one
took reverse english, and bounced back to the six yard line.

In the second quarter, Eddie Caye “took a hand off and tried the
left side of the line only to be stopped ﬁve yards behind the line of
scrimmage. Before going down, he turned and ﬁred a pass to Ron
Markiewicz who got up off theé
ground after a blocking assignment

‘V’ to ﬁnd the ball in his hands for a
touchdown.

With the breaks against them,
and the cheering section for
them, the Panthers came ‘back
determined in the second half
and drove for two touchdowns
within four minutes of one an-
other to win the ball game. No-r-4
ton Seaman kicked the all-im-
portant extra point from the 14
yard line.

What once looked like a losing
season for the Panthers may now
become a fairly successful one
providing the Blue and Gold can
win the last game of the season
against Miami to boost their over-

*"‘ all record to 5-5.
