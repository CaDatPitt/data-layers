._ > Dr. James A. Kehl, dean of the
" . School of Liberal Arts, has an-
1 nounced the new rulings on aca-
 demic probation and the Distri-
bution of Studies requirements.
 When a student's overall QPA
-falls below 2.0, he is notiﬁed by
mail that he is on probation for
the next term. Should his QPA
remain below the 2.0 minimum
" at the end of his first trimester
on probation, he may continue
on probation for an additional
term before dismissal. The clean
will review dismissals upon re-
ceipt of a written request.
To regain satisfactory academ-
ic standing, a student should re-
view his academic program. He
might consider repeating a fail-
ed course or limit his credit load.
Repeating a failed course not
only helps the student by raising
his QPA but also gives him a
ﬁrmer foundation for future prog-
ress in the subject area. Similar-
ly a lighter academic schedule
may help the student to achieve
more and to develop his interest.
Should a student lapse into a
second Period of probation hav-
ing once regained satisfactory
standing, he will be immediately
. dismissed.

A new distribution program
will require students to take 14-
15 credits in each of the three

divisions with the credits taken
from a  of three depart-
ments. V

These courses may be drawn
from series numbered 80 and 180
as well as from those other
courses that have been accepted
by the School-of Liberal Arts as
meeting the distribution require-
ment. They will include the 70-

levelcourses for students se1ect- .

ed for honors work. In addition,
the ﬁrst two courses in a stu-
dents major and in his related
area will automatically be count-
ed toward satisfying the Distri-
bution of Studies requirement.

The objective of this program
is to assure each"'student the
chance of developing critical
judgment in the arts and sciences
and the awareness of an intellec-
tual heritage.

what phony (although ad-
mittedly very effective) to
cast a halo around Kennedy
because he was tragically
murdered at an early age.

One can feel the horror of
the assassination but still
maintain that the way a man
dies does not make "him a
good President. One, can ad-
mire a person’s personality’
and other commendable qual-
ities but a country isn’t or
shouldn’t be, run by a sym-
pathy meter.

SORENSON painted a rosy
picture of the state of the
union under Kennedy. The
tide turned in foreign affairs,
he said, yet peace is as far
away as it ever was.

The New Economics has
insured prosperity he assert
ed, yet poverty by their own
ﬁgures went from 17 million
under Kennedy to 35 million
under Johnson, balance of
payments are as unbalanced
as ever, and inﬂation is again
peeking its head above the ,
horizon. /

Under Kennedy, the exe-
cutive took the lead in the
federal branch, and the fed-
eral branch the lead in Amer-
ican government, he said.
Without further explanation
we are to applaud the fact
that someone elected by less
than one-tenth of a per cent
of the vote should dominate
American government.

Student Union, SkiClub
Has First Joint Event

By J. D. GLASSER

The first of the joint Stu-
dent Union-Ski Club trips to
Laurel Mountain was held
Sat., Jan. 22. Two hundred
and twenty students turned
out for the first trip of the

season and, despite some unfav-
orable weather, most had an en-
joyable trip. ,

Student Union Director Robert
Loch and Helen Rovegno led the
journey on the two buses which
left the Student Union early in
the afternoon for the brief two
and one-half hour ride to the ski
area.

When the students arrived,
they were pushed through the ﬁt-
ting and rental process so quick-
ly that a few lucky ones even
had time to get on the slopes
before the lifts were closed down
for the dinner break.

As the snow- covered skiers
headed for the warmth and se-
curity of "the cafeteria and bar
they were treated to a display of
ﬁreworksgas the power lines came
down across the slopes. The wor-
ried students were shaken by
the prospect of having to spend
a weekend snowbound in the pow-
erless lodge as they wandered
around the candle-lit rooms try-
ing to ﬁnd some way to spend
their time.

Some solace was provided by
the entertainment of two of the
ski instructors as they regaled
the crowd with songs on the pi-
ano and recorder. A combo did
brave the storm to. come _but they
were somewhat hampered by the
lack of outlets to plug in their
instruments.

After only three, and one-half

* hours the power was turned back
on and the students ﬂocked to
the slopes for a few hours of
night skiing. But even with the
best eﬂorts of the manage-

ment and the power company
the tows on the beginners slope
were never turned back on. But
the hardy, determined to get in
their day of skiing, trudged up
the slope, came back down in one
fashion or another, and then
trudged back up again.

But the best part of the day
was yet to come. As the weary,
but ‘happy skiers—for most man-
aged to enjoy themselves despite
the handicaps imposed by nature
—— trudged through the growing
drifts back to their buses, they
had the prospect of a long ride
back and hopes that classes would
be called off on Monday.

Pecos Bill,

s year out of the West, a hero
mes to the University who is
ct so legendary and not so giant

Sylvestor Stevenson, from Tulsa,
klahoma, stands only /six feet

'" «f-Pittsburgh, but Steve had his
mind practically made up even

enior year. He was approached
;:by a friend of his, former Pan-
{ther player Julius Peques, and
agwas oﬂered a scholarship pend-
_-.''ing on his senior performance.

“ “I visited the school and was
1 pressed with what they/had to
ioﬁer,” Steve recalled. “It was a
pretty good engineering school
 I also liked the trimester. I
met the coaches and liked both
_of them." Steve indicated that
 senior year wasn’t all he had
{hoped it would be, but the coach-
Kes apparently had faith because‘
here he is. And he’s not satisﬁed
with this year either.

“No, not at all. I’m sort of oil.’
and on. very inconsistent. I have
-a good half and then a bad half.”
‘Not too many people are com-
plaining, though, because Steve
is almost always in double ﬁg-
.ures, including 20 last Saturday
_against Youngstown. He explains
that, , too. “I get a lot of assists
‘from the guards. They’re good at
“ spotting the open man.”

;a For a 6-2 forward, Steve pulls
"a tremendous amount of re-
;bounds, sharing team leadership
‘with 6-5 A1 DiFrischia. There are
‘guards bigger than Stevenson.

, “Heigh ” he explains, “is to a
certain extent unimportant in re-
 It is mostly position
fand timins—gettins the ball at
the tor» of your leap.”

Steve found the transition to
eastern basketball easy because
it was virtually non—existant. “I
think they play more defense out
.West, it’s more organized. My
high school was the highest scor-
 ing team in the state's history
_,-and we only averaged about 70
points per game.” _
Although eight games still re-
. main this season, thoughts turn
, to next year's varsity. Steve says
he’s “hopeful” but frosh coach
' Tim Grgurich is positive. “We ex-
pect Steve to grow an inch or
two over the summer. He can
1 play underneath, and he can
sfshoot from the outside. Steve's

‘ Steve plans to play summer

says next year’s team could be
“hurting in height and experi-
ence” but adds that “people say
( it (experience) means a lot, but
I‘ I never noticed it.”

Remaining Games Promise
No Respite for 4-11 Cagers

The Panthers’ record is 4-11 and there are no ‘breath-
ers’ among the seven games left on the schedule. They meet
Fordham Saturday in New York and then there’s a rapidly
improving Carnegie Tech team, to be followed by Temple,
then West Virginia . . .

Bob Lovett remains the bright
spot in the hoopsters offense. He
leads the Panther scoring attack,
averaging almost 16 points a
game. In his last ﬁve contests,
Lovett has averaged 21 points.

Larry Szykowny brought ‘his
average up to 14 points with ﬁne
shooting during last week’s West
Virginia and St. Johns games.
His 29 points against WVU repre-
sents the highest Panther scor-
ing eﬁort of the season.

The recently injured Stan Fal-

enski had averaged 12 points 3
game before he was hurt. The
other injured hoopster, Ken Bol-
ens, will deﬁnitely miss the next
several games.

But coach Bob Timmons’ big-
gest problem is still his bench.
He has been forced to use sopho-
mores Bill Buck and Bill Ben-
nett in crucial situations. To
make the matters worse he hasn’t
received any scoring from Pete
Smith, Bob Caldwell, and Nick
Generalovich- All are averaging
less than four points a game.

Assistant Sports Editor

As of Tuesday the wrest-
ling team was still buried in
some snow drift in Eastern
Pennsylvania and rumor has
it that they’ve been digging
out slowly on purpose with the
hope of missing the home meet
with Cornell tomorrow at 3 p.m.
in the Field House.

The wrestling record now stands
at 1-3 after the 25-10 loss to
Army last Saturday and the pros-
pects of beating the Big Red
aren’t promising.

Cornell puts heavy emphasis
on its wrestling program at the
expense of its other winter sports
and the results have paid off for
the last ten years:~They’ve won
the Ivy title eight out of the last
10 times and have picked up 27
wins over the past ﬁve years in
that selective circuit.

Despite ‘its success in its own
league, the Big Red has been hav-

ing trouble with the outsiders
this year. Their record going into
tomorrow’s meet is 2-5 with the
two wins coming over Harvard
and Pennsylvania. Navy downed
them 19-15, the same team which
routed the matmen' 35-3 two
weeks ago.

Last year, Cornell defeated the
wrestlers 21-11 at Ithaca. Head-
ing the returnees from that squad
is J elf Stephens, who is the reign-
ing Eastern champion at 157. He
has been wrestling at 167 thus
far this year and his dual meet
record is 4-1. His loss was to
Penn State's Jerry Seaman, who
was the runner-up to Stephens
last year in the Easterns.

Randy Kahlor’s opponent to-
morrow in the 177 pound class
will be Fran Ferraro, whose dual
meet record'is 4-2. Ferraro placed
fourth at 167 in the EIWA. In

the next weight class up Bob
