Abortion issue debated during WQED forum

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staff Writer

With few issues dividing to-
day's American public more than
abortion, representatives from
each side of the issue got the op-
portunity to voice their opinions
in a heated debate aired Sunday
on TV station WQED. .

”The purpose of the special
[program] was to provide infor-
mation on a historic case that the
Supreme Court will be challeng-

g ing,” said WQED promotional

director Lu Conser.

The program, titled Abortion: A
National Town Meeting, was
structured as a debate and was
moderated by former CBS News
correspondent Fred Graham.

BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -
Police found a mass grave just

,_ south of the Mexican border
[to Tuesday containing the bodies of

12 people who were the victims
of human sacrifice by a satanic
cult of drug smugglers, officials
said.

”It was horrible,” Cameron
County Sheriff Alex Perez told a
news conference in this border
city. ’’It was like a human slaugh-
terhouse.”

Mexican federal police arrest-
ed four people, said sheriff's Lt.

from the National Abortion
Rights League, Planned Parent-
hood Federation of America, the
National Right to Life Committee,
the March for Life and the Unit-
ed States Catholic Conference.
Aired in light of the April 9
March for Women's Equali-
ty/\Nomen’s Lives in Washington,

' D.C., the debate focused on the

possibility of the Supreme Court
overturning the historic 1973 Roe
vs. Wade case in which women
were given the legal right to have
abortions.

For the pro—choice side, the ar-
guments centered around the fact
that the privacy of women would
be invaded, as well as their
morals decided by the legislature,
if abortion becomes illegal.

”Americans ask,” said a‘

citizens, but did not identify them

police included 21-year-old

Kilroy, who vanished during his
spring break last month while in
the Mexican city of Matamoros,

at random by drug smugglers
who hoped human sacrifices

9 Insufficient funding may

limit hospital services  

By Rich Kirkpatrick

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG (AP) - Hospital
services for the needy may be cut
if the state doesn't restore about
$44 million for medical educa-

3 tion and hospital reimbursements

in the upcoming budget, hospi-

tal officials said Tuesday.
Officials from the Hospital As-

sociation of Pennsylvania and

three hospitals said at a Capital»

news conference that hospitals
are being squeezed by the state
cuts and reduced payments from
private insurers.
Hospital Association president
»John Russell said hospitals may
have no choice but to cut services
for the needy if they can't balance
their books.
”There’s no way hospitals can

continue offering services if the‘

budget goes through in its present
form,” he said.

Gov. Robert P.-Casey has pro- -

posed eliminating $22 million for
graduate medical education and
offered a 2.5 percent increase.for
inpatient medical assistance rates
and no inflation increase for out-
patient fees. However, Casey's
budget spokesman Rod Snyder
said the spending plan calls for an
1 1.8 percent increase in -funds for
outpatient services.

Hospitals want the $22 million
restored, and a 5.8 percent in-
crease for both inpatient services
and outpatient fees, Russell said.

About 800 people from hospi-
tal medical and administrative
staffs lobbied with lawmakers
Tuesday on restoring money to

representative from the NARL,
”who will now get the right to
make decisions on the personal
and moral issues of women? The
women themselves or the poli-
ticians?”

The pro—choice panel then
refuted a pro-life statement by
saying that the further along in
pregnancy, the more a fetus is
capable of feeling.

”Ninety percent of abortions
are [performed] in the first
trimester of pregnancy,” stated
the pro—choice side.

They then proceeded to
proclaim that if abortion were to
be made illegal, poor and lower
working—class women would be
most greatly affected.

”It has been continually proved
that with money comes the ease

to make decisions that those
without money [cannot make],”
stated a pro-chioicer.

”What about the women who
cannot afford to raise a baby? We
thought that the pro—life case was
aimed toward the welfare of
these babies,” a panel member
added.

They concluded that Ameri-
cans should be equally con-
cerned with the health of the
women involved as well as the
fetus.

When the turn came for the
pro—life side to state its case, panel
members appeared more emo-
tional than their counterparts.

The thrust of its case- targeted
abortion as murder.

”Innocent fetuses are being
maimed,” stated a member of the

NRLC.

The pro—life side claimed that
since it believed the fetus to be
alive from the moment of con-
ception, it is entitled to constitu-
tional rights. .

”With conception begins the
journey of life,’’ said a pro—life ad-
vocate. 

Refuting the pro—choice argu-
ment that the majority of abor-
tions occur in the first trimester of
pregnancy, the anti-abortion side
attempted to get an answer as to
whether abortion was legal dur-
ing all nine months of a woman's
pregnancy.

”We just want to know,” asked
a panel member from the pro—life
side, ”if [when] a woman is

Federal regulation of gas prices halted

WASHINGTON (AP) — A
House panel approved legislation
yesterday to end 35 years of fed-
eral control of natural gas prices,
a step cheered by the energy in-
dustry but criticized by some
consumer groups even though
decontrol could mean slightly
cheaper gas for the nation's con-
sumers.

The House Energy and Com-
merce Committee, on a voice
vote without dissent, sent the
measure to the full House, where
even its strongest critics say ap-
proval is likely.

A similar measure has been in-
troduced but not yet acted on in
the Senate. .

The legislation would complete
a price decontrol process that be-

' gan in 1978 with the Natural Gas

Policy Act, which removed price
limits on certain kinds of gas
while also establishing two
dozen categories of gas, each
with a ceiling price.

About one-third of U.S. natur-
al gas currently is subject to fed-
eral price controls.

The House bill, sponsored by
Rep. Philip Sharp, D-lnd., would

lift theremaining price controls
as supply contracts expire or are
re-negotiated, with all such limits
to be removed by Jan. 1, 1993.

Oldest archdiocese
sees new archbishop

BALTIMORE (AP) ~ Bishop
William H. Keeler of Harrisburg,
Pa., who was named yesterday as
the 14th archbishop of the na-
tion’s oldeset archdiocese, said
he was humbled by the ap-
pointment.

NEWS BRIEFS

‘'1 am honored and deeply
grateful to our Holy Father for this
assignment,” Keeler, 58, said at
a news conference. ’’I pledge to
Pope John Paul my loyalty, and
I know that I have his support.”

He will be installed May 23,
succeeding Archbishop William

_D. Borders, 75, who retired.

Borders will continue to serve as
administrative leader of the arch-
diocese until Kee|er’s installation.

Keeler, who has been extreme-
ly active in interfaith work, is con-
sidered a conservative who has
taken stances against cohabita-
tion, premarital sex, abortion and
capital punishment.

Strip searching may
end in Pa. schools

HARRISBURG (AP) --
Teachers would be banned from
strip searching students and stu-
dents would be barred from par-
ticipating in athletics if they take
anabolic steroids under legisla-
tion approved by a House panel
yesterday.

The House Education Commit-
tee unanimously approved legis-
lation that contained several
changes to the state public school
code.

The proposal approved by the
committee would provide for a
$300 fine or a 90-day jail sen-
tence for any teacher convicted
of strip searching a student.

As for steroid use, Education
Chairman Ronald Cowell, D-

Allegheny, said the incidence of
the drug among school students
at all levels has increased during
the past 10 years. There is also in-
creasing evidence that steroids
cause long-term health problems,
he said.

Limited TV coverage

of Senate debated

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ A
Philadelphia Republican law-
maker yesterday introduced a
plan that would allow limited
-television and radio coverage of
the Senate for the first time.

Sen. M. Joseph Rocks’ proposal
is an attempt to ”promote further
openness in government” and
provide the public with a means
to better understand the Senate's
part in the legislative process, the
resolution said.

Rocks’ plan would prohibit
filming, televising or broadcast-
ing of sessions of the Senate ex-
cept when authorized. All audio
and video recordingwould be
made by Senate employees and

would be provided to licensed ra- ‘

dio or television stations upon
request. »

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April l2, l989

. Calloused and uncaring?  
Pittsburgh Press reporter homeless on assignment

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Journalists have long been la-
beled asiuncaring and unaffected
by the disasters, broken families
and shattered lives which they

_ report about every day. It is an
¢ image solidified by the cut-and-

dried, ”just the facts” style in
which most news articles are
written..

One man, however, has used
his gift of creativity to tell a per-
sonal story despite the constraints
of newswriting rules.

Douglas Heuck, a 27-year-old
reporter for The Pittsburgh Press,
has done more than just tell a sto-
ry in writing an investigative ser-

¢ ies on life as homeless person.

Writing as a participant in the
lives of those he describes,
Heuck has inspired and informed
his audience.

Heuck grew up in Cincinnati.
During high school he was edi-
tor in chief of the school's
newspaper, planting" the seeds a

Qcareer, the harvest of which he

would reap later at Kenyon Col-
lege, where he founded an in-
dependent monthly newspaper
called The Gambier /ournal.
Heuck explained that his goal
with the journal was to present
the facts without reprisal from the
college administration. That moti-
vated Heuck to sell advertising
and handle money matters to
keep the journal financially in-
dependent from themschool.

After graduating in 1984, he -

wandered through a series of odd
jobs until landing his first writing
assignment on a weekly, The
Phoenix in Brooklyn, NY; He
said he was fired from that job af-
ter two weeks,‘ because ”the guy
told me I had no "curiosity and
would never make. it.”

’ Heuck eventually wound up in
Pittsburgh, and was hired by The

 

 

Press to cover meetings. He
laughed that the type of reporting
he was doing then involved ”four
topics that you write about," tax-
es, police, school boards and
roads.

To a writer like Doug Heuck,
that assignment was somewhat
frustrating and boring. He ex-
plained that to him, journalism af-
fords the reader and the reporter
the opportunity to ”see worlds
right next to you, and be shocked
and horrified by them.”

That was when he conceived
the idea for an investigative piece
on the homeless in Pittsburgh.
Heuck said that the idea struck
him one day when he ”won-
dered what it would be like to be
in that situation.”

After presenting his idea to the
editors, it was agreed that Heuck
would spend two weeks at the
end ofjune and beginning ofJuly,
posing as a homeless person. He

would interact with those he

a‘

would meet on the streets, and at
the end of the two weeks, he
would write a series of stories
about life on the streets of the
city.

And so, after a last night's visit
to his parents’ home, Heuck
gathered some tattered clothes
and took to the streets. He spent
three of his nights in shelters and
the remaining 11 throughout the
Strip District, at Point State Park
and in Squirrel Hill.

Heuck’s first fear was that he
would not fit in with the home-
less, but would be an obvious
outsider. He found, however, that
”There are all sorts of people
who are homeless." It was this
variety that allowed Heuck to
keep his cover.

”Most people who are home-
less see the problem as temporary
and don't see it as their identity,”
Heuck observed. ’_’All responsi-
bilities and obligations sort of slip
out the window.”

    

$1

Heuck ran the first of his arti-
cles in late July. Stepping away
from the guidelines of conven-
tional journalism, Heuck told his
story from a first—person point of
view. ”The object of the story
was to show people what actual-
ly exists,” he said, and that much
of the ”intimacy” of the story
would have been lost had he
tried to tell it from a typical third-
person omniscient viewpoint.
Heuck said he saw himself serv-
ing as a guide through the world
of the homeless.

Heuck achieved success by
taking an interest in his surround-
ings and attempting ”to effect a
change!’

”Nobody expected the feed-
back that came," Heuck said.
‘Ti here were] messages from TV
and radio stations. A lot of letters
came in, a lot of calls. I was a lit-
tle bit overwhelmed by it.”

The response generated by
Heuck’s story not only has en-

 

lightened the readers of the
homeless in Pittsburgh, but also
has furthered Heuck’s career. As
a result of the story, Heuck has

established himself as one of _

Pittsburgh's top investigative jour-
nalists. After the story ran, he said
the editors began to grant him
bigger assignments. Heuck re-
mains humble about his success,
adding that he had hoped the ser-
ies would allow his editors to
trust his judgement on other ar-
ticles.

Heuck has proven that good
fortune can visit people who
care. He has shown that one per-
son can make a difference. By
presenting the plight of the home-
less in a dignified manner, Heuck
has not merely alerted the read-

er about this growing problem;

he has also shown the homeless
as ordinary people with feelings,
concerns and ambitions, whose
road to success was marred by
obstacles and obtrusions.

pick one Anglo male that partic-
ular night,” the lieutenant said.

The cult had been involved in
human sacrifices for about nine
months, he said, and prayed to
the devil ”so the police would
not arrest them, so bullets would
not kill them and so they could
make more money.”

Authorities would not com-
ment on the other victims, and
would not say whether any were
U.S. citizens.

The 12 bodies were found
Tuesday morning in a field about
20 miles west of Matamoros,
along with evidence of voodoo or
magic, Gavito said.

"I've been an investigator 15
years and it's one of the worst
things I've ever seen,” he said.

Kilroy, a pre-medical student,
vanished from a crowded
Matamoros street shortly after 2

‘am. on March 14 while on a

drinking foray with a group of
friends in Matamoros, a city of
180,000 just across the Rio
Grande from Brownsville.

Law officers on both sides of
the border were stumped, with
no clues to Kilroy’s disappear-
ance despite an intensive search,
the questioning of nearly 100
people and a $15,000 reward.

Casey told him the administra-

He said the education money
was eliminated because he felt
the money could be better spent

many doctors helped by the state

poor patients. The program was

er that hospitals already are at the
breaking point. Hospitals are los-

.Takeover inherent;

chairman confident

(AP) — H.H. Robertson Co.
Chairman Jack Hatcher said
management is not worried by
New York investor Douglas Kass’
plan to buy at least 40 percent of
the company's outstanding com-
mon stock.

”lt’s just obvious that he be-

-lieves the company stock is a
good buy at the price right now,”
Hatcher said. ”We’ve got a com-
pany to run. We're not going to
stop what we're doing to try to
figure out what he's doing.”

Kass and his firm, DAK Part-
ners, said in a required filing
Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that he
has obtained clearance to expand
DAK’s 5.18 percent holding.

Hatcher said the company

”Frank|y, it doesn't concern us
that much,” he said.

The stock closed Tuesday at‘

$10.50 per share, up 50 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.
Robertson manufactures steel
roofs, facades and other building
parts. It reported a loss of $28.2
million on sales of $413 million
for 1988. Its fourth—quarter profit
of $1.1 7 million, or 19 cents per
share, was the first in three years.

Robertson averted atakeover
by Canada's Belzberg family in
1986 by giving the investors three
board seats. The Belzbergs own
more than 25 percent of the
stock.

Hatcher said Kass could not ac-
quire the company without
cooperation from the Belzbergs.

the abortion?”

Replied a pro—choice advocate,
’’I suppose so.”

At this point the moderator
turned the floor over to questions
from the audience. Points of the
pro— and anti—abortion arguments
were rehashed by audience
members supporting either side.

I reached to answer the phone.
’’Hello?”

‘'50 you didn't get arrested.”

”Hi, Mom. Are you watching
the news?”

”Yes. I just saw the police
punch that guy in the face. I was
just wondering if you were all
right,” my mother said.

”Well, if I had gotten arrested,
you would have been the first
person I called for bail.”

”Did you get hurt?" she asked
in her motherly way.

”No. I couldn't find an extra
ticket for Monday's show and
when I saw the police in riot gear,
I went back up to the parking lot.
I did see the rush though,” I said.

”I guess all those hippies
freaked the cops out, huh?” she
asked. .

”Yeah, I suppose they did. Can

9 you say uptight, Mom?”

She laughed. ”We|l, I'm glad
you're all right. Take care, hon,”
she said.

”Bye, Mom,” I replied‘.

I went back to watching the
news, learning that the last time

‘ Pittsburgh police used riot gear
was when the Steelers won the
8 Super Bowl in 1979.

The station thenshowed two
clips from KDKA—TV; one was of
a cop punching a Deadhead
when both of the young man's
arms were pinned behind his
back, and another featuring a
policeman kicking another per-
son (who was also being held) in
the face.

  

JESICA
COVILLE

I've waited untilnow to pen
this article of mine because I

wanted to see if anyone else at '

the university wanted a chance at
this story.

Since no one approached the
editors, I decided to pull out my

handy-dandy soapbox and ask a
couple of questions about crowd
control, police brutality and The
Grateful Dead.

I was at the concert both nights.
On Sunday, there were eight
policemen to cover the event.
There were 50 arrests made that
night for various reasons; drug-
and alcohol-related crimes, for
the most part.

These 50 arrests then prompt-
ed 27 (yes, 27, folks) more police-
men to arrive for the concert on
Monday night.

Riot gear?

Call me naive, but what hide-
ous acts could have prompted full
riot gear? I have yet to hear an ac-
ceptable answer.

If you know something about
The Grateful Dead, then you
know that most of the people
who follow them (dubbed Dead-
heads) are peaceful people. They
go from town to town ”on tour”
with the-band because they ap-
preciate the music.

Unfortunately, with a group of
39,000 (the estimated number of
people at the Civic Arena), there

are going to be some trouble».

makers.

My question is, with the band
so incredibly popular now, why
was the event held at the Civic
Arena (which only holds about
17,000 people), when we have
Three Rivers Stadium?

The parking lots are bigger and
it's far enough away from any
residential neighborhoods that
the Deadheads could have
camped out without creating any
problems.

But no, Pittsburgh decides to
solve the problem with riot gear
and what I personally believe to
be police brutality.

Now we have Mayor Masloff
and Public Safety Director Can-
non considering whether the city
should ban The Grateful Dead.

What's next, Ms. Masloff?
Should we burn Dead albums
along with Run-DMC’s (another
group also banned by the city)
records? Maybe we should just
ban music altogether.

Hmmm... why don't we ban
the Pens, the Pirates and the
Steelers while were at it? There
are rowdy fans at those events,

Wednesday, April I2, I989

Proper police behavior and The Grateful Dead concert

probably more there than there
are at a Dead show.

What's the difference between
a drunk Pens fan and a fan of The
Dead? Dinero, baby, dinero.

I'm relatively disgusted by this
situation, as I'm sure you can well
see. It's not because I'm a Dead-
head (I don't tour with them) that
I disagree with the police in riot
gear. I disagree with their even
being there.

The Dead have been around
for over 20 years, and I'm sure
they will be around for a lot
longer. The city's overreaction
only gives both the band and
Pittsburgh a bad name.

So Ms. Masloff and Mr. Can-
non, take another look at the
tapes. Hopefully you will realize
that the situation was handled in
a bad way and that people who
appreciate the music of The
Grateful Dead should not be
punished for the actions of a few.

Abortion. You know the argu-
e ments (at least some of them), and
you knowthe sides to_ choose from.
iYo'u’re either for it, against it, or
are totally dumbfoundedyin coming
to terms with it. With the recent ju-
dicial review of Roe vs. Wade, two
basic scenarios can be put forth as
possible outcomes, adding further
grist for the judicial mill: If Roe vs. '
Wade is overturned, the only means
for having an abortion will be coat
Q hangers and trips to Europe. Most
' will be unable to afford the latter.
There may very well be a popula-
tion surge among those lower socio-
economic families who are already
- without sufficient means of support.
Women’s rights will have been dealt
a severe blow.

The other scenario", less dramatic
than the first, will basically be a con-
tinuation of the present situation.
This is what so severely irritates the
conservative right and religiously af-
filiated pro-life camps. To them, we
are now drowning in a sea of ignomi-
ny which should tweak any God-
fearing American’s conscience, if he
or she has one. In legislating against
abortion, hopefully they would be
able to save a substantial number of
potential people.

These opposingviews are practi-
cally impossible to argue when de-
bating about abortion. There’s just
no give-and-take, as it’s a zero-sum
situation for both parties involved:
mothers and fetuses. That, along
with the extreme hotheadedness and
self-righteousness of people on both
sides, has created a convoluted po-
lemic which is more frustrating than

. clarifying, and_has produced less in
the way of crucial insights and more
in the way of ignorance, violence and

, strained communication.

After so many years of such
breakdown, what should we make of
it? Until now, the major tactic for

3‘ either side has been to create com- I

pelling moral and constitutional ar-
guments which would eventually lead
to legislation. That is what Roe vs.

PERSPECTIVES oN ABORTION:

Wade has done, and what the pro-
life camp would like to do in over-
turning it. But beyond such efforts,
has there really been any complete
resolution in anyon_e’_,s consc,ier_,1jg:_T,f”;;;_‘;
At this moment, our Supreme Co’u’r't*
has limited choices. Its members can
choose between unnecessarily abort-
ed (conceived) fetuses, or the strip-
ping away of a woman’s basic right
to control her body. Alone, both the
right to life and the right to choose
- would be unanimously affirmed. But
as conflicting issues, it is extremely
difficult to establish any sort of
primacy. As a judicial issue, it is still
a zero-sum game, as one side must
concede its rights at the game’s con-
clusion, with legislation keeping all‘
involved honest. The present judi-
cial review may proclaim a new win-
ner. Unfortunately, even a new
moral (and legal) champion will not
make things much easier to swallow,

The issuesof the abortion debate are more complex than

PART 3 or 3

as there will still be some big losses.
Sadly, the struggle for moral and
legal hegemonybetween the life and
choice camps has been extremely in- e
sffsséual in. <=<_>.mi.r.1s.t°.t.e.rr.r.1.s With die. ;

I ' problem responsible-for sueh-vehe-

ment conflict in the first place. On

closer inspection, this inability to 4

face the real issue appears to reveal
a major flaw in almost everyone’s
logic in approaching the abortion is-
sue altogether. We’ve forgotten how

it is we ended up playing the game .

in the first place: men and women '
getting together to cause pregnan-
cies. Now, at first this may seem su-
perfluous, but that first impression
is mainly a product of abortion-
argument conditioning. In fact, it is
absolutely, positively necessary to
get pregnant if one is to have an
abortion. So, in essence, one could.
say the real primary issue is sex, and
how one conducts one’s sex life.

  

I I 

"A curse on both your houses,”

I declare to the camps of life and -

choice, as F..D.R.‘ once did to the
houses of labor and capital, back in
the ’e'ra:of' the Néw‘Deal.' It'is' rriy '
opinion that the major oversight
(and tragedy) of the abortion debate
is that while both sides continue
their vociferous, essentially selfish
posturing, "still the people go on f-
cking,” which is another quote, but
this time from Kurt Vonnegut, and
straight out of Breakfast of Cham-
pions. Both camps have been so
nearsighted and defensive about
their positions that no one, to my
knowledge, has thought of directing
all of that energy toward the“source
of mutual frustration: unwanted
pregnancies. The present abortion
debates have done nothing to put
forth any constructive arguments or
proposals intended to resolve the
problem at its origin, and while both
sides have been clamoring for
"rights,” people are still ending up
with fetuses they .did not expect,
want, or make provisions for.
The roots of the abortion problem
have existed long before there have
been articulated abortion arguments.
What’s worse, sex has only recent-
ly become a sanctioned public issue.
Due in great part to massive sexual
taboos and irrational religious or-
thodoxy, this country has only re-
cently begun an awareness campaign
designed to advocate safe-sex prac-
tices, with heavy emphasis upon con-
traceptive use. While the main
thrust of that effort has been in
response to the relentless tide of
AIDS,'the complete failure to deal
with it until now can be viewed as
part of the failure to effectively come
to grips with our unwanted pregnan-
cy problem. Both tragedies are the
result of jgnorance, and often-times
a refusal by certain influential social
groups to recognize the problem as
shared by all. As we have seen, both
abortion and AIDS as issues did not
achieve complete public attention
until those problems began to affect
the middle and upper classes. By‘
‘ that time, both problems,were.bot_h

far past the crisis stage. But then
again, a crisis is sometimes a mat-
ter of perspective.

So while the abortion debate has

,. tried toplay catch,-up, it overshot the

,r..ea,l, problem and instead merely at-
tempted to secure rights. Rights are
certainly very important and foun- E
dational to any" just operation of so-
ciety, but the achievement of rights
at the expense of a true solution
often only blunts the problem. Fur-
thermore, sometimes the debate
whichiintends to spawn insights only.
obscures the real problem even I
more, and redirects the issue fun-
damentally. The abortion polemic is
a paragon case. Both pro-life and
pro-choice camps are guilty of strug-
gling for selfish ends. Pro-lifers, in .
their refusal to address the essential
problem of unwanted pregnancies,
are seeking only to gratify their
moral consciences, knowing that
they will have made it illegal
(although far from impossible) to ob-
tain an abortion. Pro-choice groups,-
in their refusal, are settling only for
the right to choose. This promotes
(though not in the case of rape or
life—threatening situations) indirect-
ly a failure to take responsibility for
one’s sexual activity. .

Is it too simple to ask that if there
were no unwanted pregnancies,
there would be no abortion debate?
I can understand being accused of
idealism. But as I see it, the abor-T
tion debate at present promises no
resolution which even comes close
to dealing with the source of con-
flict, and it remains a zero-sum game ‘

‘without a satisfactory conclusion.

Fetuses are still being aborted un-I
necessarily. Neither a legal right to
life not a legal right to choose can
constructively address the realities
of our sexual lives, or the alarming
rate ‘of occurrence of unwanted.
pregnancies. These are the issues to
be faced squarely. While rights are
definitely essential, when they be-
come the sole focus of effort and at-

i . tention and as a result obscure the
- problem which cries for a solution,

itis no-' longer a zero-sum game —-a '

justa. question of morality vs. constitutionality.

it’s. a iero-sum tragedy.

Gore

wasted
CBA
chance

0 Think Demetreus Gore is
perturbed? The former Pitt basket-
ball star, who was taken in the
fourth round of the Continental
Basketball Association draft by
the Tulsa Fastbreakers, is playing
basketball at the Fitzgerald Field
House when he could be in the
semifinal round of the CBA

playoffs.

   

MATT
MARTIN

As the Fastbreakers attempt to
advance to the finals, Gore is still
shadowed by an incident at the
Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport, where he was arrested
for possession of an unregistered
weapon.

Gore, however, still would not
have been with the team. When
contacted earlier in the season, a
Tulsa spokesperson said that
Gore never showed up at train-
ing camp, and that it was thought
he was playing overseas.

0 A week ago, Steve Fisher was
the luckiest, happiest man alive.
This week, he's the new head
coach of the Michigan basketball
team.

Although his resume is impres-
sive — seven-year assistant at
Michigan, a 6-0 record as an in-
terim head coach, Michigan's first
national championship — noth-
ing is being taken for granted by
Michigan AD Bo Schembechler.

Schembechler signed Fisher to
a one—year contract. Anything
else would have been
preposterous.

After the ride that Fisher-‘was on
in the NCAA tournament, he will
be in the national limelight next
season. Much will be expected of
him. And if he doesn't deliver,
the marriage that the Michigan
fans have with him will soon be-
come a divorce at the hands of
Schembechler.

0 As if Frank Viola doesn't have
enough problems — -he's 0-2 in
his first two starts of the season
for the Minnesota Twins after
winning the 1988 American
League Cy Young Award — the
Twins compounded things by
offering him a paltry $7.9 million
three-year contract. Rather than
be insulted, the major league

leader in wins over the past five ’

years insists he will probably not

be back in Minnesota next

season. . ‘
Viola, who sought $8.1 million

0 from the Twins, wins the goat—of—
~ the-week award. Despitehis track

record, no other team will com-
pete with an $8 million man.

' Witness the problems Orel Her-
I._shi$-er andthe ..L-A-.D0d8.s%rsr.b3d.-

Demetreus Gore was taken by the CBA’s Tulsa Fastbreakers in last year's draft.

Olson prime candidate

before reaching a $7.7 million
agreement.

Unless Viola reconsiders, he'll
find himself traded for someone
who gives more of a hoot about
the pitching aspect of the game
rather than the money aspect.
The Twins certainly won't let Vio-
la slip out under free agency
without benefiting from his
departure. '

0 Another problem-child, Dar-
ryl Strawberry of the New York
Mets, recently discovered that he
was allegedly the father of a
1-year-old daughter in St. Louis.

Strawberry lives in New York,
as does his wife.

Strawberry expressed his dis-
pleasure with his Mets contract
earlier in the season. Although
he's been quiet since, the Mets
should shop him. He's unques-
tionably one of the most talent-
ed players in baseball today, but
is also a detriment to the attitude
of the club and the public’s atti-
tude concerning the team. Straw-
berry would bring no meager
return in a trade.

0 Is it Isiah Thomas, or is it the
Detroit Pistons basketball team?
The All-Star point guard, who in-
jured his hand in a fight with
Chicago Bulls center Bill Cart-
wright last week and is out for
three weeks, has become the
fourth of the Pistons enforcers.

Dennis Rodman, Rick Mahorn
and Bill Laimbeer have all had
their run-ins with other players
from ‘around, the league.

. Although allthree. are.»key..play-

ers in the Piston rotation, none
has the impact of Thomas. '

The Pistons sport the best
record in pro basketball today.
Can they keep it without the
talented hands of Isiah? Is Tho-
mas actually the newest bad boy
on the block, or will his absence
make the Pistons work that much
harder to gain a second consecu-
tive berth in the NBA Finals? Stay
tuned.

0 When Patrick Ewing first
came into the NBA from George-
town in 1985, Adidas began mar-
keting a sneaker in his name,
something that is commonplace
for big—name athletes like Ewing.

After four years in the league
and a progression that has seem-
ingly brought Ewing to the top of
his game, he has broken his com-
mitment with Adidas and be-
come part-owner of a shoe
company known as Phoenix.

Title notwithstanding, it's a step
down for Ewing. The fledgling
Phoenix company, however,
now has its first marquee name
to help deliver its goods.

How will the company market
Ewing? As ”Jammers from Jamai-

ca”? ”Ewe’s Shoes”? ”Pat’s
Flats”? ”Knickerbocker Un-
naturals”?

0 If NBA teams allow their stars
to take part in the 1992 Olym-
pics, there's no doubt that the
United States will claim the gold
medal in that event. No other na-
tion can even come close to the
athleticism the U.S. pros display.

Pirates
beat Mets
4-3 in
opener

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

Bobby Bonilla singled home
the winning run off reliever Ran-
dy Myers with two outs in the
11th inning as the Pittsburgh
Pirates won their home opener
Tuesday night, beating the New
York Mets 4-3.

Jose Lind singled with one out
in the 11th off Myers, 0"-1, stole
second and moved to third on
Andy Van Slyke’s ground out to
second.

Bonilla then bounced a slow
roller that third baseman Dave
Magadan caught with a back-
hand stab. But Bonilla easily beat
his three-hop throw to first, as
Lind scored.

Jeff Robinson, 1-1, retired all
three batters he faced in the 11th
for the victory as the Pirates end-

ed a four-game losing streak. The I I

Mets and Pirates are both 2-4.
The Mets led 3-2 when Myers

- replaced Sid Fernandez, who had
pitched three scoreless innings in -

relief of starter Bob Ojeda, in the
ninth.

Lind drew a leadoff walk,
moved to third on Bonil|a’s one-
out single to center, and scored

7'on"G"lenn Wilson's sacrifice fly to

right.

Lind entered the game _0-for-8
lifetime against Myers, including
four strikeouts. Last season, op-

posing batters were 12-for-75 _

for Kentucky position

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Lute
Olson appears to be the No.1
candidate, for Kentucky's vacant
basketball coaching job if the
price is right. ‘

Olson, head coach at Arizona,

‘is expected to meet’ with Ken-

tucky athletics director C.M.
Newton this week’ to discuss the
details of the job.

”Hopefully, it'll work into
that,” Newton said of Olson be-
coming the school's prime can-
didate to replace Eddie Sutton,
who left under fire. ”Obviously
we're interested and obviously
he's interested.”

Olson and Newton were ex-
pected to meet in Lexington on
Thursday.

Newton, however, said Mon-
day night that he had not offered

' the post to Olson.

”We’ve still got some more
things to talk about,” Newton
said.

Cedric Dempsey, University of
Arizona athletic director, said he
gave Kentucky officials permis-

sion to talk with Olson but didn't '

know of the coach's intentions.
”I would hope we could bring
all these rumors to a head and
resolve what needs to be
resolved,” Dempsey said.

_   .Dempsev said that .bsf0re the t

C

Olson-Kentucky linkup, he had‘

recommended that Olson's con-'
tract be extended three years and
his base salary be increased, and

that the Board of Regents had ap-__ . 

proved the measure. .

The current contract has two _ '1
years to go, meaning Olson,’ 
would have a five-year contract‘ 0
at Arizona. The Arizona Repub-R
lic in Phoenix said Olson's cur-‘
rent base salary is believed to be . 
between $85,000 and $95,000 
with a total package reported to   r
be worth between $400,000 and _ I 

$500,000.

The Republic alsolreported that  ‘
one unidentified source said the-'

Kentucky package for Olson

would be more than $750,000_,;

each season. ‘

Olson, 54, was offered the Ken-?_ 
tucky job in 1985 but turned it _"  _

down. — 
He has compiled a 137-55

record in six seasons at Arizona. 1

Olson also has said the sanc-
tions Kentucky could receive

from the NCAA Committee on In- 

fractions as a result of 18 alleged
violations of NCAA rules could
influence his decision. Universi-

V ty officials are scheduled to meet 
with the NCAA Committee on In- 5

fractions on April 22.

Detroit

DETROIT (AP) — Carmen
Castillo hit a grand slam in Min-
nesota’s eight-run eighth inning,
and Kirby Puckett drove in two
runs Tuesday with a double and
a homer, leading the Twins to
their 12th straight victory over
Detroit, 14-0.

Allan Anderson worked seven '

innings for the Twins, allowing
seven hits as he beat the Tigers
for the fourth straight time. Rook-
ies German Gonzalez and Gary
Wayne completed the shutout
with an inning apiece in relief.
Gonzalez struck out all three bat-
ters he faced, and Wayne gave up
one hit in the ninth. _

The Twins chased Detroit's
Jack Morris, 0-2, in the fourth in-
ning, and already leading 6-0,

‘they blew it wide open in the.

eighth. .

Clay believed to be one of rapists FOOTBALL

By Owen Canfield

Associated Press Writer

NORMAN, Okla. — The victim
of an alleged gang rape in an Ok-
lahoma athletic dormitory told a
court Tuesday she came to be-
lieve suspended Oklahoma foot-
ball player Nigel Clay was one of
her assailants after discussing the
case with prosecutors.

Clay, Bernard Hall and Glen
Bell, Sooner teammates, are ac-
cused of first—degree rape in the
alleged attack at the dormitory on
Jan. 21. Hall and Clay face two
other charges each of furnishing

/liquor to a minor.

The victims has testified that
she and a friend had gone to Nor-
man for a double date with two
Oklahoma football players, and
that said she was attacked after
she came out of a bathroom in

 
      

 

the athletic dormitory.

Sherrelyn Lynette Osborn said
she and her boyfriend, Larry
Medice, were in Medice’s room,
directly below Clay's, when she
heard screams.

’’It was a noise that sounded
like a struggle,” Osborne said. ’’I
said, ’Nigel must be fighting
somebody.’ ”

Osborn said the noises got
louder, she heard a second
scream and that the noises sound-
ed as though someone was fall-
ing to the floor. -

”We looked at each other and
said, ’It sounds like some girl's
getting her butt kicked/” she
said.

She said Medice went upstairs
to investigate. A few moments
later, she said, she went to find
Medice.

- - ame downstairs an o o
I‘ i 

  

me some girl had just got raped,”
Osborn said.

She said neither she nor
Medice called police. They later
told the district attorney what
they had heard, she said.

In cross—examination, Osborn
told the court she had once
described the screams as possibly
being screams of passion.

The 20-year-old Oklahoma
City victim spent seven hours on
the witness stand Tuesday for the
second day of a preliminary hear-
ing which is used to determine if
the suspended football players
should be tried on the charges
filed against them in Cleveland
County District Court.

Clay's attorney, Joel Barr, be-
gan Tuesday’s questioning by
asking the victim when she came
to believe Clay may have been
one of her assailants. The wom-

an said she had seen evidence
Feb. 9 in the district attorney's
office that led her to believe Clay
was one of the attackers. The
prosecutor's office filed charges
the next day.

She said she believed, because
of his size, that Clay woud have
been the fifth of the six people
she said attacked her. An Okla-
homa media guide lists Clay as
being 6—foot—4 and weighing 274
pounds

In earlier testimony, the victim
had said the fifth attacker
”knocked the breath out of me.”

The woman often struggled
with questions from Barr and
from Charlie Cox, Bell's attorney.

Cox tried to determine how
many men were in Clay's room
and how many the woman was
able to identify.

Knight enjoying caddy role for Nancy Lopez

(AP) — The caddy shouldering
the golf bag looks familiar, but
out of place.

Shouldn't he be wearing a
baseball uniform, and swinging a
bat?

For 18 years, until this spring,

he did. A
Ray Knight, MVP of the 1986

World Series, is caddying for his’

wife, Nancy Lopez, on the LPGA
Toun

”It’s something I've always
wanted to do. I can be with her
out here and [with] the family
more. I've enjoyed it,” said
Knight, recently retired from an

‘i

 

18-year career, the last 13 in the
major leagues.

”I know a lot of people tease
him about carrying my bag, but
he's my best friend, not just my
husband,” said Lopez, an LPGA
Hall of Famer. ’’I want him here.

”With Ray out here, I can play
a lot of tournaments and try to be-
come the leading money winner
again.”

”I’m leaving the game feeling
I can still play,” the 33-year-old
former infielder said. ”But I don't
want to be a part-time player. I'm
not good at that. I've always been
an intense player, keyed up.

”I can't sit and wait. The more
I sat on the bench last year, the
more I thought about retiring. I
think I made the right decision,
but it's going to take awhile to get
used to it.

”I’ve never lost that en-
thusiasm, never lost that joy,”
said Knight, who, in addition to
his World Series MVP year with
the New York Mets, had .300
seasons earlier with Houston and
Cincinnati. -

In past years, Lopez adjusted
her tour schedule so she and her
husband could spend time
together. But when Knight was

  

traded from Baltimore to Detroit
last year in spring training, it
threw their plans into disarray.

”Nancy’s schedule was already
set according to Baltimore's
schedule,” Knight said. ’’It didn't
match with Detroit's schedule
and we wound up seeing each
other only five weeks during the
entire summer.”

Knight said his new job ”is not
as easy as it looks.”

”He knows what he's doing
out there,” said Lopez, who will
be among the favorites in the

gives me the yardage and keeps
me from making mental
mistakes.”

So far there have been virtual-
ly no family spats on the course.

But, recalling the Kemper
Open earlier this year, Knight
said, ”We had a disagreement
with club selection; I thought she
should use a 4-iron to the green
and she wanted to hit a 5-iron.”

Lopez proceeded to hit the
5—iron short and into the water.

”I ended up saying, ‘See, you

never listen to me.” Knight said.

HILTON HEAD ISLAND,
S.C. Newly crowned
Masters champion Nick Faldo
has no great expectations for
the $800,000 Heritage Classic
this week.

But the long—range prospects
are something else. I

”I’m at my peak now,” the
31-year-old Englishman said
Tuesday. ”The next five years
should be my best.”

His target for those five
years: more major champi-
onships.

”One a year?” he mused.
”That’s about the ultimate per-
centage. That’s what Uack]
Nicklaus did at his peak.
That's about the ultimate.”

And that's very nearly Fal-
do’s pace. He won the 1987

Mastersgives Faldo Iong—term goals:

British Open, lost the 1988
U.S. Open in a playoff and
now is the winner of the first
major title of 1989.

His emotionally draining
playoff victory in Augusta,
Ga., last Sunday took its toll,
however.

”It’s been a very long, very
busy last couple of days,” Fal-
do said, and sketched out his
post-Masters schedule:

Four hours of sleep Sunday
night, with a 5 a.m. wake—up
to appear on three early-
morning network talk shows
Monday morning, followed by
a return visit ”to clear out my
locker” at the Augusta Nation-
al Golf Club and-a drive over
to Hilton Head Island.

A series of trans-Atlantic
telephone calls, including one
to wife, Jill, took up the rest of

the day.

Tuesday was taken up with
more telephone calls, more in-
terviews and a practice session
for the Heritage event that be-
gins Thursday.

It is that sort of schedule that
may limit his peak-
performance seasons to a five-
year period, Faldo said.

”l’ve been playing pro golf
for 14 years now. Five more
and it's close to 20. That's a
long time on the road,” Faldo
said. ”It could be I'll be
burned out by then.”

He listed the extensive,
almost non-stop travel and
heavy demands on his time as
major factors.

’’In seven weeks we might
go from Europe to Japan to
Australia to the States and
back to Europe,” he said. ,

By Denne H. Freeman
AP Sports Writer

IRVING, Texas Tex
Schramm is being cut out of key
decisions made by the new own-
er of the Dallas Cowboys and
may not. be in the club's front
office much longer.

Schramm, the glue that held
together one of the NFL’s most
successful franchises, is consider-
ing the job as commissioner of
the new international league that
will develop talent for the NFL.

”I’m keeping my options
open,”-he said on Tuesday.

However, Schramm, president
and general manager since the
club's founding, has been on the
outside since Jerry Jones pur-
chased the Cowboys from B_um
Bright on Feb. 25.

For example:

0 Schramm didn't know Jones
gave new coach Jimmy Johnson
a 10-year contract until reporters
told him. I

,0 Schramm wasn't asked to

Schramm’s future may
not be with Cowboys

join a meeting last weekend be-
tween Jones, Johnson, quarter-
back prospect Troy Aikman of
UCLA and his agent, Leigh
Steinberg.

0 Schramm did not attend a re— -
cent beer and barbecue session
that Johnson and Jones held for
the players. Jones invited some
100 business friends.

Asked about being left out of
the decision-making, Schramm
said, ”That’s the prerogative of
the new owner. He said from the
beginning he was going to be in-
volved in everything from socks
to jockstraps. He has [been].”

Schramm also said from the be-
ginning he didn't think he could
handle a day-to-day caretaker
role after nearly three decades of
calling the shots. '

”That’s not my style,” he said;

Schramm won't admit he has
made a decision but he talks as
if he has decided to do something
other than be a figurehead for the
Cowboys.

Canada ’s Williams says
he didn’t use steroids

' TORONTO (AP) — Desai Wil.
liams, a teammate and close

friend‘ of —.s"pri-i1?ter?.Ben Johnson‘, 

Tuesday denied being on steroids
since the 1970s, saying he’de-
ceived his coach into thinking he
took the banned drugs.
Williams, Canada's top
200-meter runner, admitted in

testimony at a. hearing into drug *
use by Canadian track and field 7

athletes that he.-took steroids brie- I
fly in 1987 under threat of cen-
sure from his coach, Charlie
Francis.

”Charlie’s philosophy was: ”It’s
my way or the highway,’ ” Wil-
liams said. A

Williams told the investigation

into cheating in sport that.‘-”drugs"-1., *
played a major role in my deci- _

sion” to leave“ Franc-is'for' four
years, beginning in 1983.

”I don't think I was-given a fair
chance because I think they
(drugs) were being pushed on me

-a little bit too,,_.often,” he said. I
Francis, sprinter Angella Is- '

sajenko and other teammates
have testified that Williams, John-
son and others began taking
drugs 3 forbidden by internation-
al sporting groups 8 in 1982.
Johnson was stripped of the

  

Olympic gold medal in the.

100-meter dash last year when he
tested positive for steroids.
Williams said he returned to
Francis in 1987 and took the
drugs briefly before being
injured. ' .
