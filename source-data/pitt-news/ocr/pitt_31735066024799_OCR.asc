ommittee Not Consulted on Kirkpatrick 

By SETH LU BOVE

Sometimes, the committees of
Pitt’s Senate Council become so
numerous and varied that the Coun-
cil takes on the appearance ofa Con-
gressional system of committees.

Other times, committees which
were said to have been consulted
actually were not,.and it leads to
some rather embarrassing moments
for the individual who stated that a
particular committee was consulted
on an issue.

This, it was revealed the May ll
Senate Council meeting, was the
case with the selection of United
Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpa-
trick as the honorary degree recip-
ient at this year’s commencement.

Contrary to a previous statement i

made by William Brown, president
of the University Senate, in the April
23 University Times that Pitt Chan-

‘ cellor Wesley Posvar had consulted ‘

with the Educational Policies Com-
mittee of the Senate, the chancellor
never did consult with the commit-
tee regarding the choice of
Kirkpatrick. '

“The Educational Policies Com-
mittee did not review the recipient
of this year’s degree,” said Richard
Pratt, chairman of the committee.

The political science department
was contacted regarding the choice
of Kirkpatrick, but not completely.
Only six members of the.depart-
ment’s faculty were consulted, Pos-'
var ‘revealed. A ‘

“There wasn’t in fact a formal
consultation” with the department,
Posvar admitted. 

“This year we accelerated the pro-

cess,” ‘Posvar said, citing the diffi-

culty of securing a speaker t_hrough
active recruitment. But nonetheless,
there were nothing but good inten-
tions regarding the whole process,
and “everyone was sincere, everyone
was well-intentioned,” Posvar later

»added.

There is no university-‘wide policy
regarding consultation with the
Senate committees or the discipline
of which the speaker is a member
but Posvar has exercised this perog-
ative on his own accord. C . P

In the future, a special committee
chaired, by John Quatroche, secre-
tary ofthe university, will screen and
set procedurg» regarding the selec-'
tion of honorary degree recipients.
Formation of the committee, has-
tened by the controversyisurround-
ing this year’s recipient, was part of
an April 14, I980 Senate "Council
resolution prepared by the Educa-
tional Policies Committee. —

“Obviously, that’ committee had
to beset up quite far in advance for
to have worked , and it wasn't,”
Brown said. a i

In another matter involving the
Educational Policies _ Committee,
the committee‘ reported Monday
that at’the present time it could not.
“endorse a recommendation” for'a "
university-wide language require-
ment. - - _ -'

Although the committee in its ‘
report -recognized. “general ‘sym-
patjiy” among Pitt’s“ faculty for the
promotion of foreign language
study, negative impacts on _.recruit-'
ing; curricula, university resources,
and the difficulty of defining compe-
tence were cited as the major reasons
for the committee’s decisionnot to‘
endorse the language requirement. ’

financial aid. “Any additional
requirement at the high school level
with which students and ‘parents
must deal is always perceived as yet
another obstacle or barrier to the
enrollment process...we emphasize
that presenting this as an admission
requirement has a negative effect on
good students who might, other-
wise, be planning to apply.”

Steele Gow, dean ofthe College of

General Studies, told the committee‘

that “For CGS, which serves work-
ing adults, most of whom are long
out of high school and a majority of
whom have some previous college
credits before they come to us are
t_herefore not truefreshmen, the con-
sequences would be disasterous for
both recruitment and retention,
probably cutting our 6,000 enroll-
ment in half."

The general consensus among the
professional schools such as nurs-
ing, pharmacy and engineering was
that a foreign language requirement
would displace other electives, such
as literature or art.

sion"), it has failed to afford women
the ability to have it both ways
because they cannot have a success-
ful career and a satisfying personal
life. This inequity is a battle to be
fought by the feminist movement in
the 80’s, Bachrach said.

“Although you have it easier than
we did, you still don’t have it all,”
‘Bachrach said. “You still can’t be
happy professionally and personally
if you‘re a woman. This is most
unfair. But this is yourfight, and I
hope to hell you win it.”

Fast Talkers I

The University of Pittsburgh
emerged victorious over the other 61
debate teams selected to participate
in the national finals held at Califor-
nia State Polytechnic University,
Pomona, California, April I0-I3.

The Pitt debators won a 5-0 deci- I

sion over Dartmouth in the final
round. The topic debate was
resolved: That The United States
Should Signiﬁcantly Increase Its
Foreign ‘ Military Commitments.

The Pitt debators are Steve Mar-
zen, graduating senior from Ann
Arbor, Michigan and Mike Alberty,
a junior communications major
from Portland, Oregon. Marzen will
attend the Harvard Law School in
the fall; Alberty will return for his
senior year and continue debating.
Their coach is Dr. Thomas Kane,
Associate Professor of Speech
Communication.

  Pitt, Oakland  

it  and City Council

The University of Pittsburgh and the Oakland community are
inexorably tied. Oakland’s problems, such as housing, safety and
parking, are shared by the university since many Pitt students reside

in Oakland. In addition, long time Oakland residents worry about
. the effect Pitt’s expansion has had on their neighborhood. A

Some candidates in this year's City Council primary campaign

A - have very definite views on the relationship betweenthe university
and Oakland. These ‘are people who have had extensive. experience.

working in Pittsburgh neighborhoods. They understand the prob-
lems Pittsburgh neighborhoods are facing, and they deserve a chance
to voice these concerns as city council members. They are:
Mary Lou Daniel, 47, a Democrat from Elliot. Daniel is the
coordinator for Pittsburgh’s Neighborhoods for'Living Center and a
former director of the Pittsburgh Neighborhood Alliance. "Daniel
said she believes the university has to work with neighborhood
groups to alleviate Oakland’s housing problems. She thinks Pitt
officials have the clout to encourage the Port Authority to develop a
more efficient mass transit system to lessen Oakland’s parking prob-
lem. Daniel also faults the university for not communicating with the
Oakland community in planning its expansion.

David Patrick Hughes, 35, a Democrat from Squirrel Hill.
Hughes, a Pitt graduate who lived in Oakland for 30 years, is the
Health Director ofthe Pittsburgh Free Clinic. He worked in neigh-
borhood programs for l5 years, and also taught school in Manches-
_ter. Hughes said Pitt showed little foresight when it expanded
without planning for the changes the surrounding community would

have to undergo. He sees this lack of concern for people as a general »

_trend among public officials. -
Victor Willem, 32, a Democrat from Greenfieldﬂazelwood. Wil-
‘lem is an experienced neighborhood planner andadministrator;
currently, he serves as director of the Semple Senior Citizen pro-
gram. Willem said Pitt’s expansion has left its surrounding neighbor-

7  , hoods with a fear of “institutional growth” because they had no role

in and did not understand the nature of Pitt's growth. He sees a need

  for a closer relationship between Pitt and the city, since Pitt has

‘played a large part in changing neighborhoods and placing-new

 demands on thecity. _ _ _
 ~ . ﬁjoliflingaro, 26, Consumer Party candidate from Oakland. Zin-

garo is the coordinator of the Semple Stre Co-op, and a member of
the'Pittsburgh Neighborhood Alliance and the South Oakland Citi-

' 3 -,zen’s Council. Zingaro believes the university can play the role of a

 ,, ‘protagonist in supporting community efforts to crack down on

, '5 j T absentee landlords, ﬁnding quality off-canpus housing forstudents,
V and cleaning up Oakland.

The common thread that runs through the positions of these

 ., ‘candidates is their belief in the need for Pittsburgh neighborhoods to
S  be represented in City government decisions. Many neighborhoods
'5 are finding their needs overshadowed by Rennaissance ll and the

city’s emphasis on developing the downtown area. v
- For the University of Pittsburgh and the Oakland commuinity, the

'_diff"iculty of living together continues. The candidates above have

[offered their ideas on how the university and Oakland can best strike
- a balance that will satisfy both sides. They suggest that cooperation is

 a first step to alleviating the problems Pitt and Oakland share_. It is :

Column

Education:*Well Worth The Cost

By LARRY LUNSFOSRD

Is college really worth it?

That’s the question posed by syn- pi

dicated columnist Ellen Goodman
in a recent column. Ms Goodman
describes the problem of decreasing
enrollments colleges and universities
have faced in recent years and how
institutions have resorted to cheap
thrills campaigns to lure students to
enroll. The columnist does a good

job of describing the woes parents, ‘

students, and institutions encounter
each academic year, but she fails to
answer the question: ls college really
worth it?

John Sawhill, the former presi-
dent of New York University is
quoted in the column as saying col-
leges and universities are “going
after adults with all the grace and
dignity of the California gold rush."
Ms. Goodman herself added that
students are recruited “with all the
gentility of a Ph.D. Barnum and
Bailey." _ .

Perhaps there is ‘value in critici-

zing the recruitment methods, but '

what about the resul-ts of the recruit-
ment? These critics appear to ques-'
tion the role of institutions in
attempting to replace what are
called the traditional students,»-the
18- to 22-year-olds, with what we
refer to as non-traditional students,
those persons previously not
expected to seek higher learning.
Somewhere in all this the American
dream has gotten lost.

The American system of higher
education has moved to a system of
education for the rnasses—and edu-
cation for a lifetime. A college edu-
cation is generally accepted as a
necessity. We hearthat education
should be open and life-long. Thus,
there is a philosophical acceptance
of the right to fail. - '

These new _students showing up
on ourcollege and university cam-
puses come from a variety of back-
grounds. Many are first generation
students who cometo us academi-
cally ill-prepared. Others are ethnic
and racial minority students, women
seeking education in traditionally
male fields, people seeking a career

change, veterans, housewives, and’

the individual who is usually 55-
years or older -and has already
retired professionally. The latter
group is one population on which

’ colleges and universities have con-

centrated heaviest. One. out of nine
Americans is over 65-years-old, and

they have been objects of benign '

neglect for years. _

The latter groups of folks have
caused"much change on our'cam-
puses. In some cases, actual institu-
tional missions and goals have
altered toyaccommodate the needs of
these new learners. New programs
_have been added and others
modiﬁed. W

‘ These people deserve to be re-
cruited. They deserve the chance to
have the opportunity to ._learn. Our

colleges and universities are obli-r’

Although many high school grad-
uates are ﬁnding rewarding and lu-

vc job: without attending col-'
col ege, this still does not take away

from the true value that a college
education offers to the individual

and to society. The benefits far out-~

weigh the negative aspects of obtain-
ing a college degree. ‘

One ofthe many Policy Studies in
Higher Education conducted by the
Carnegie Council predicted for the
future that “colleges and universities
will compete for ever more scarce
students in destructive ways, includ-
ing false advertising, easy academic
credits, soft courses, grade inﬂa-
tion...” Perhaps we shouldn’t spend
so much time criticizing our decision
to recruit non-traditional students,
but instead spend some time design-
ing, new and more professional
means of recruiting and educating

Education is well worth the cost.
Ann Landers said it best in one of
her columns: “if you think educa-
tion is expensive, try ignorance.”

  iO1g1tsiders Make It On Their Own
/And They Like ItThat Way    

If you decide to run for City
Council and expect to win‘ a seat,
you‘d better have three things going
for you. The first thing is to be a
Democrat. The second is to receive
the endorsement of the party. The
third is to have a big campaign fund.
Of course, the second automatically
facilitates the third.

If you're a Democrat and you
don't get the party nod, you have
one strike against you.You'd better

social cause.
lfyo_u're a Republican running for
Council, first think twiceiabout run-
ning. Consider that all nine
members of City Council areDem0-
crats, and almost always have been,
and that of the voters registered in
the city of Pittsburgh, approxi-
mately 164,000 are Democrats,
34,000 are Republicans, and ll,000
are registered with third parties. If
you still decide to run, then contact“
all your friends and ask for cam-
paign money. Then mount a cam-

paign to convince the voters thafyou
have friends in high places in Harris-
burg and Washington, D.C., friends
in very high places, preferably the
U.S. _Treasury if not the White
House. '

If ’you’re an independent, you
practically have three strikes against
you “before you even start the cam-
paign. You don‘t have the endorse-
ment of the Democratic
Party.Second, you are up against
the tendency to vote along party
lines, no matter how palatable your
solutions to problems are. Third,
you don't have widespread business
support or $20,000 to run the cam-
paign. You’d better mount a grass

— roots campaign and hope for a mira-

c_le, like only lndependenzﬁshowing
up to vote on election day.

The obstacles, then, to an “out-
sider,” even if’ that means being a
Democrat in good standing who
doesn’t have official party backing,
are formidable.‘ To understandiwhy
‘the _city became so locked into this
sysfem you have to go back to 1906.

In that ‘year, 43 of the then 72
Council members were indicted on
bribery and fraud charges. Although
the charges were swept under the
rug, what grew out ofthem was the
l9ll Pittsburgh Plan, that man-

dated a council with nine members

elected at-large, as opposed to the
old system whichlelgected council
persons "by, the wards they
represented.

According to Professor
Owens of Pitt‘s Urban Studies
Department. the at-large system
makes it xery difficult for a non-
endorsed candidate to win.

Ray

\“The city is overwhelmingly
Democratic, the ward chairmen do
the work getting out the vote. Until
recently, it's always been enough,”
he said. "‘ '

That is until’l979, when environ-
mental activist Michelle Maddoff

 

 

ran her “Maddofffor City Council"
campaign without party support
and won. ' A
“She had a high visibility and was
well-known through her work on
pollution control (with Group”_

* Hughes
Against‘ Smog and Pollutioi1),”
Owen said. ' _ _ , _ §

Council by district elections; as
proposed by Councilman Tom Fla-
herty, who calls the old method
“anachronistic,” would change all
that according to Owen. “lt’s easier
to oppose endorsements with dis-
trict elections,”Owen said. “ You
have to please people in the district.
With a grass roots campaign its pos-
sible to win. _/

“Political party. organizations
don’t like to see it. You’re gonna
have tremendous publicity opposing
it.” C A u ' -

Most city council members are on
record as favoring the old system.

Democratic candidate Jack
Wagner from Beechview is running
because “we need better representa-
tion on City Council”. He is not wor-
ried, he, said, about not being
endorsed, ,

“There are -18 people-running on
the Democratic ticket; four are
endorsed,” Wagner said. "I am not
one of them. All four can be beaten.
I intend to be one ofthem (who will
beat them).” Wagner drives a street
cleaner which he is borrowing from
“a friend of a friend” on the cam-
paign trail.

David Patrick Hughes of Squirrel"
Hill, Director ofthe Pittsburgh Free
Clinic, said he decided to run
because he is fed up with certain
Counicl members. “As we go
around, every person we talk to is
thoroughly disgusted with the
Democrats and thoroughly dis-
gusted with City Council,” Hughes’
said. i ‘ _

“My real goal is to change the
Democratic Party to a more grass
roots, democratic kind of populous
party in this city,” he added.

Republican candidate David E.
Dean of Shadyside said the main
theme of the Republican campaign

‘ is “accessibility to_ funds” in the state
capitol and in Washington.

“We’re obviously going to be

strapped for cash in this city because’

of cutbacks on the federal level so
what’s going to be most critical is
correct application of the funds that
are available and access to them,”
Dean said. , ,

How does Consumer Party candi-
date John_ Zingaro of Oakland feel
about running as ‘an Independent?

“It feels great,” heisaid. “lionce
described it as being able to go into a
library and having permission to yell
and scream while everyone else
stayed quiet.” »

Zingaro openly calls himself a lib-
eral, and on" voting "day, “we’re up

against the stigma of running as a

third party—l prefer to call it an"
alternative party. - 

“We’re“ trying to ‘show people

running for the convenience of the

Zingaro said the Consumer Party
movement in Pennsylvania, which
will be I5 years old this month, has
about 5,000 members in the Phila-

delphia area where the party began,
and over l,000 in the western part of
the state. Nationwide it takes the
form of the Citizen's Party which is
only two years old, and whose
'spokeman is consumer advocate
Barry Commoner. 

Zingaro’s campaign is part of a
national campaign, and represents
not just local\ issues. He said he.
would rather work outside the sys-
tem than play,favorites with the

, Party. ~

“Once you’re in office your hands
are tied, because you got elected to
office on the basis of favors and per-
sonalities," Zingaro said. “We’re try-

'ing. to get a coalition of people

interested strictly on issues we’re
dealing with. lt’s useless to get
elected unless youhave a mandate to
act. a

“The Democratic Party in Alle- i_

ﬂicts of interest it’s best to sidestep
that whole tangled web and start

The Inside Story A

” The Pitt.News, Wednesday,.May I3, 1981 ' V '

The Old Political  Machine
 Ain’t What ItUsedto Be

In the old days, when smoke—filled
rooms were a standard fixture in
Pittsburgh politics, a handful of
kingmakers could wave their hands
over the headof a candidate and
transform him into an office-holder.

Things aren‘t quite the same
today. The machine has grown
rusty, the smoke—filled room has
given way to the tastefully decorated
corporate office, and the candidate
must impress more than a handful of
kingmakers to get elected.

Thereare a number of reasons
why the Democratic Party in Pitts-
burgh is no longer the well-oiled
machine it was during the days of
Mayor David Lawrence. Acultura-
tion of ehtnic groups, movement to
the suburbs, and loss of patronage
jobs, have all made people less
dependent on what the old machine
had to offer.

~ /“In the history of
Allegheny politics it
was a historical
reform, ” Flaherty said.
“The party has cer-
tainly opened up as far
as the political process
is concerned.” ,

In addition, the process of endors-
ing a candidate h_as changed. At the
height ofthc machine's power, a few
men would decide on who would be
included on the party slate. These
candidates were guaranteed almost
certian victory. P

In recent years the selection‘ pro-
cess has been opened up to include
the hundreds of county-comrnittee-

persons. The committee-persons‘

meet in a convention, listen to the
various candidates for office and
then vote on whom to endorse.
According

 

Council member, Tom Flaherty, the
new selection" process, brought

about in the early 70’s by former.

party chairman Eugene Coon, has

made the endorsed candidates more‘ .

‘ representitive of the whole party.

“In the history of Allegheny polit— o‘.

_ics, it was a historical reform,” Fla-
herty said, “the partyhas certainly
opened up as far as the political pro-.
cess is concerned, and I think that it

In this year’s elections, particu-’

    
 
 

llarly the council race, the Demo-
is healthy for the party." \
' Despite the changes, however, the
backing of Pittsburgh’s Democratic
party can‘ be a valuable asset for~a
candidate. — _ A e

  

‘cratic party is probably the best

means of gaining office. It provides
organization, funding, and name
recognition where a candidate,
alone, may have none.

I

This year's council race includes a
field of l8 democrats. For the most
part, their campaign funds are small,
in the range of $1,500 to $3,000,
gathered mostly from small'contri-
butions. In the case of the endorsed
candidates money came in the form

of $0 to $250 dollar donations,
This is not to say that it isthe

party itself thatbis>po.uring money.

.into -.-these campaigns, but the

' endorsed candidatesare a_utom‘ati-‘

cally plugged into an organizational

  

structure that can yield that sort of

‘ capital.

In addition to funding sources,
the party can provide a network of
volunteers and campaign workers
for a candidate. Also, there is the
fact that many people are inclined to

‘vote a’“straight‘party ticket without

giving much thought to who’s name
is o_n it. .
Many times, these factors will al

come together and put a candidate
in office, but there have been excep-
tions. Pete Flahrety was the first pol-
itician to beat the machine and
become mayor. Michel-leg Madoff
also circumvented the parTy*appar-
ratus to “become a City Council
member. What distinguishes the
organization of today from the

macihineiofipthe, past is the lack of
certainty. ' ' 1 *~

Two meet and stadium records
were broken and a third tied at the
llth annual Pitt Men’s Outdoor
Track Invitational at Pitt Stadium
Saturday, a meetmarked by disap-
pointment for a Pitt triple jumper
and an Ohio Statemiddle-distance
runner trying to defend his l980
record-setting performance.

Pitt’s Larry Kinney, certainly a
favorite for an assault on the meet
triple jump record, was scratched
early in the day after aggravating a
hamstring‘pull.

“The injury was suffered‘ last
week, but he certainly may have
been ready for the meet,” a Pitt

trainer said. “However, when he.

woke up this (Saturday) morning, he
had some pain, and we decided he:
shouldn’t aggravate it any further.”

The day’s biggest disappointment
was mo_re of an embarrassment for

Ohio State’s Scott Rider, who last ‘

year set ameet and stadium record
of l:48.3 in the 800-meter run\.

The Buckeye runner, competing
in the second of two heats, moved
into the lead at the 200-meter mark
and held that lead until, with 50

' metersleft, Penn State’s Mike Cook
‘and Seton Hall’s Brian Jennings
blew by Rider, leaving him far back_

in the pack."

The strongest Pitt challenge in
that heat came from Greg Conover,
who made a move from his third-
place spot with [20 meters left. But,_

« like Rider, Conover was left trailing‘ ,
in the pack whenthe race was)‘,

between Cook and Jennings.

Cook finished in 1:49.23 with M.»

nings a close second at'l:50.2. Con- "

over finished in l:_5l.7i for sixth
place, but the Panthers“Garla‘nd

Brown won thefirst heat in l:5‘l.5i

for a fifth-placelfinish overall,
Other than Brownlanld Conover,
Pitt’s best were Ralph Mitton, 46_'
feet 7 inches in the ‘triplejumpgand
the mile relay ‘team, which finished

fourth in 3:l6.9;. A » _
lf the meet had any one strong

performance, it came from Seton

After concluding its best season in
27 years at 25-8, the Pitt Panther
baseball team has to hope its statist-
sics will do the talking as the Eastern
selection committee pores over its
nominations for the upcoming
NCAA Eastern Regionals.

On paper, at least, it looks like the
Panthers can’t miss. Besides owning
one of the best records in the East,

the team packs five players averag-i .

pitching rotation that has accounted
for all 25'wins, and includes 1) a

two no-hitters this season, 2)_a fresh-

The Pitt Panther’s men's ten-
nis team closed out its spring sea-
son with a strong 4-l record over
* break.

Several individual performers
shone as the Panthers peaked in
the last third of the season to
finish 7-5.

Going into the season, Pitt
coach George Diffenbach pre-
dicted that his team, largely inex- .
perienced at the outset, would
improve with each match. And
they did.

Pitt began the late surge at
home with a tough 5-4 victory
over stubborn West Liberty
State College on April 9. Six of
the nine matches went to the
three-set limit.

Pitt’s Mark Weinberg and Jeff
Brand clinched the win with a
6-3, 3-6, 7-6 victory over Jim
Dinnocenzo and Randy Snyder
in the next-to-last doubles match
of the day.

“It was a great Pitt tennis vic-
tory and a strong effort as a
team," Diffenbach said. “Brand
and Weinberg pulled through to
clinch the victory after a thrilling
ending in a I2-point tiebreaker at
No. 2 doubles.”

White, Wagner, Brand and
Steve Berkovitz gave Pitt four of
six victories in the singles. West
Liberty’s No. I doubles team
Rick Rhbades, and Rod Work-.
man, rebounded to defeat
Wagner and White to close the

margin to 4-3 before Brand and
Weinberg‘s dramatic win.

The next day, Pitt came back
and defeated visiting Slippery
Rock, 6-3. Again White,
Wagner, Brand and Berkovitz
led the way in the singles for Pitt.

In the doubles, White and
Wagner teamed to outlast Chuck
Veitmer and Joe Bartos, 3-6, 6-2,
6-3. Berkovitz and AI Sodomsky
teamed at No. 3 doubles to pull
out a close match, 6-4, 7-5.

“Slippery Rock was a close
match,” Diffenbach said. “The

I key matches were by White and
H Wagner in singles, followed by"

Tennis Team Closes SeasonWith Surge

Brand and Berkovitz at No. 5
and 6 respectively,_ in the
singles.” _ "'

Those last two vit ories in sin-
gles gave Pitt son breathing
room going into t. . doubles,
breaking a 2-2 deadlc . .4 after the
first four matches.

Pitt extended its win .treak to"
three with a rain-shor- -‘led 5.-l-
victory over Carnegie-We ‘llon.

Despite playing thCti' third

match in three days, the Panthers S

came out strong behind Wagner
and White to take the first two
singles matches. CM U’s Chris
Kopchak was the lone bright
spot for the Tartans, with a 6-1,
6-3 win over Tony Calderone at
No. 3. _
Brand, A Berkovitz, and
Sodomsky swept the last three
contests to clinch the match for
Pitt before. the doubles segment
of the competition was scratched
due to rain. A

The team got a rare day off
before traveling to California
State on April I3. But the Panth-
ers didn’t enjoy the visit.

In 50-degree weather on out-
door courts marred by cracks,
California State ripped to a 9-0
victory over Pitt. ,

Cal State won convincingly

“It was our sixth match in

Diffenbach said. “As students
and athletes, our guys were tired
and under academic pressure.”

But the skid was short—lived as
Pitt rebounded to beat Robert
Morris on A-pril I4, 5-4, indoors
at the Airport Racket Club.

The Colonials started strong
with victories at No. I and No. 2
singles over White and Wagner

ana’s runs were unearned after Pitt
committed four errors in the ﬁfth as
‘ Indiana registered its ﬁve runs. The
game extended Lacowicz’s streak to
SI innings without surfendering an
earned run. In addition, Lacowicz's

four strike-outs gave him 75 in jus

64 innings this season. ‘
The Panthers rallied from the 5-0
deﬁcit to belt four home runs to win
the game. Mihalik again led the Pitt
attack with a 3-4 game, with one
RBI, assisted by senior first base-
man Rich Kline, who went 2-3 with 2
RBl’s. Marc Massa, Dennis Stitch,
Mike Fitzpatrick and Kline all
cracked homers for the Panthers. It
was Massa’s homer in the bottom of
the rotnth that ignited the Pitt rally.
” In the second game, Krause, a 6-4
righthander from Allderice High
School, completed the season unde_-
feated (7-0) with a 5-I victory. Sed-
eral of the scouts who came to see
Lacowicz pitch stuck around to
watch the up-and-coming Krause,

who limited the Indians to four hits.

and four walks, and struck out nine
in going the distance. Indiana's lone
run in the third, and was unearned.
unearned.

Leftfielder Doug Steiner led Pitt
with a 3-3 day at the plate, that
included one home run and 2 RBI’s.
Stiener also recorded two stolen
bases as the Pitt team ran all after-
noon on the Indiana team, chalking
up four base thefts and setting up
several runs on hit and run plays.

Stiener also made a sparkling def-
ensive play in left in the top of the
sixth when he went up againstthe
fence in left-center to rob Indiana's

. Bill Marquette of a home run. Dar-
rell Gissendanner barely missed

' making a superb diving catch in the
. _top of the third after blazing a long,

. long way from his right ﬁeldspot to
‘short right center, just beyond the
A‘ infield. The ball popped out of Gis-
sendanner’s glove as he hit the grass,
but he held the Indiana batter to a
single. '

within this week. Since many of the
committee members have not seen

team are relying on their statisticsato

“We were rolling, winning I7 of 19
the last few weeks and we own the

assessing Pitt's chances. “But, either

Pitt Duos  
Get Respect  

Despite not playing a spring colle— _‘
giate season, two Pitt Pantherette?“-e‘
doubles teams made a strong show-
ing at the Middle States Intercolle-

_giate. Tennis Championships three
weeks ago. '

Randy Belkin and Kathy Jacob-
son, entered the tournament seeded
fourth in the ﬁeld which included
representatives from 40 schools
from Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
New York and West Virginia. Lisa
La Furia and Alden Lacaria teamed

. as Pitt's other entry in the two-day
tournament held in Trenton, N. J ..

-Belkin and Jacobson shot by /75::
Seton Hall in the-ﬁrst match, 6-2,
6-I, before stumbling against Syra-

I cuse, 6-3, 0-6, 6-2. ‘

“Even though the score may not
indicate it, they were all close games
and very tough sets against Syra-
cuse,“ said Pitt coach Fran Webster.
‘“Its an honor in itself to be seeded A
fourth and it shows the respect for
these two girls by _the other schools."

The lossdropped the Pantherette
duo into the consolation bracket
where they eased past Lehigh,_6-2,
6-2. The win sent the Pitt teammates
into the quarterﬁnal round against
Rutgers. L I

In a close match, Rutgers survived

I with a 6-4, 6-4 win that ‘knocked
Belkin and Jacobson out of the tour- S
nament. Webster was pleased with ("J

- the two Pantherettes":p]ay, espe-

- cially since most other schools play
year-round schedules and Pitt plays
only a fall season. -'

“The weather conditions at the
tournament weren't ideal, but the
girls ﬁnished very well". They’ve been
practicing but they haven’t been in
‘any real competitions since the (fall)
season,” Webster said.

Pitt's other doubles entry, Lisa La
Furia and Alden Lacaria, opened
almost-identical to their teammates,
as they also defeated a Seton Hall Q!
team, 6-3, 6-3. The similarities stop
there though, as a Lehigh team de-
feated the Pantherette pair, 5-7,-6-4,’
7-5 in a hard-fought match.

Webster said.v“The match could’ve
gone either way." ,

Pitt assistant basketball coach
Seth Greenberg, billed as the “ener-
getic young coach” and “excellent
recruiter” of the Panther staff, had
his seemingly sage advice backfire
after Pitt‘s failure to sign highly-
touted Jeff l-loffler, a 6-9 center,
from Connecticut.

Greenberg, 25, whose dislike for
collegiate press manifested itself in
hisstill ringing words of wisdom,
“only say what you know” and “stay
within your limits.” Greenberg
found just how much of his foot
could fit into his mouth after Pitt did ,
an about-face and announced they
were no longer recruiting Hoffler
because of his poor grades,ja prob-
lem Pitt anticipated at the outset.

Earlier, head coach Roy Chipman
and Greenberg had characterized‘
the signing of the highly-coveted
Hoffler as almost a formality, but
they came away from Connecticut 1
empty-handed after a visit to secure
Hoffler’s signature. , - "A

Why did Greenberg go against his ; i’

- own advice toT“'say only what you .
know”? i - P

“I just didn’t want to tell you the.

truth,” Greenberg replied.
