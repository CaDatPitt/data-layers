However, like most big move-
ments, the_Pennsylvania League

sprung up over night. Unlike the
mid-western states where the con-
test program was developed and
planned from the beginning, Penn-
sylvania had to develop its pro-
gram out of existing organizations.
It was the outgrowth of re-
gional contests which had ex-
isted in Pennsylvania since 1900.
In Fayette County and in north-
western Pennsylvania, especial-
ly, speech and music contests
had been held for a number of
years.
_ Under the leadership of -Uni-
versity and state. educators, the
Pennsylvania League expanded
and each year, except for the dark
days -of World War II, sponsored
a major three-day festival in dif-
ferent :cities throughout .the com-
monwealth. . g M .
Strict Policy Followed _

_.ThelIeague committee follows
a strict policy which requires that
the conference be held in -a diﬁer-
ent city each year. This idea
spreads out league conferences so
that they are accessible to every
participating community.
"' While the league provides

participants. in speech and mu-
sic, it also accomplishes ulterior
goals, expressed in the follow-
ing excerpt from we Pennsyl-
vania Forensic and Music
League Bulletin: .

“ . . . the League has a far
greater effect on young people
than providing a means of de-
velopment in music and speech.

By AL DONALSON _ -

Ron Sobel, Col. ’57, was elected president of Men’s Coun-
cil last Thursday evening at the Fairfax Hotel. ‘Three of the
four All-Pitt representatives in Council voted for Sobel, who
had the support of the 10-vote Panther Party bloc, to en-
_able the former MC social chairman defeat the Indepen-
dents’ Danny O’Conne11, Engr. ’58, by a narrow 13-11 margin.

After election results were announced by Election Chair-

the dean of men, Sobel immedi-
ately assured the Independents
that they will “benefit from any
legislation passed” during his ad-
ministration. -

As an Engineer in the Transmission
Section of Bell Telephone Company of
Pennsylvania, Richard M. Walsh plans
for the future. ‘ « '

“Our group’s responsibility,” says

Dick, “is to see that we have suﬂicient
facilities to handle present and future
needs. Telephone usage _is growing every
year, and we keep up- with this growth
by keeping ahead of it. .

“For instance, to meet the increasing
demand for communication circuits in
our area, we’re adding 70,000 new chan-
nel miles this year alone, at a cost of
$3,500,000. Laying new cable will give
us 40,000 of those channel miles, and
we’ll get the other 30,000 through use of
carrier equipment, which lets us send a

DicklWalsh graduated in 1953 from the University of
Delaware with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. There
are many interesting career opportunities in other Bell
Telephone_ Companies, and in Bell Telephone Labora-
tories, Western Eleclric and Sandia Corporation. Your

number, of long distance. calls on each
pair of wires. simultaneously.

* “Thus, though a cable might have only
300 pairs ofwires, we can, with carrier,
make it carry over 3000 telephone calls
at one time. Using carrier equipment to
get extra circuits out of cab1e—which_ is
expensive to make and lay—is an example
of how we engineer to give high-grade
service at the lowest possible cost.

“Before I graduated from college I had
interviews, with twenty-eight companies.

Out’ of all these I chose the telephone

company because it had the most to offer
in the way of interesting work, training
and opportunity. This certainly‘ turned
out to be true. In a growing business
your opportunities grow,'too.”

IT’S LATER THAN YOU THINK!

All year long you’ve been promising yourself to go‘

there. Now summer vacation is just around the corner and
you still haven’_t set foot in the place. Shame on you!

But it’s not too late. Right now, this very minute, before
you weaken, lift up your head and forward march to the
place you have been avoiding ever since school began. I refer,
of course,‘ to the library.

 

Now here you are at the library. That wasn’t so bad, was
it? Of course not! Go inside. What do you see? A sign that
says “NO SMOKING.” Go outside. Light a Philip Morris.
Smoke. Go back inside.

’- Because now you.are ready. Now your trembling
“resolution is rigid. Now your pulsing psyche is serene. You
have been gentled by gentle Philip Morris. You have been

tranquilized by a smoke that dates and pampers and caresses, 10
that lifts the fallen, repairs the shattered, straightens the.

bent, unravels the knotted, rights -the askew, and fastens the
unbuttoned. . “ ‘
In the center of the library-you see the main circulation
desk. Look in the card catalogue for the number of the book
you want, write-the number on a slip, and hand it to the
eﬁicient and obliging young lady at the desk. The efficient
and obliging young lady then gives the slip to an efficient‘
and obliging page boy who trots briskly back into the stacks,
curls up on a limp leather encyclopedia, and sleeps for an
hour. or two. Then, puffy but refreshed, he returns your slip
to the eﬂicient and obliging young lady at the desk, who tells
you one of three things: (a) “Your book is out._” (b) “Your
book is at the bindery.” (c) . “Your book is-on reserve.”

‘Having learned that the circulation desk hasn’t the
least intention of ever parting with a book, let usnow go
into the periodical room. Here we spend hours sifting through

an imposing array of magazines-—magazines from all thefar . ~

corners of the earth, magazines of every nature and descrip-
tion-but though we search diligently and well, we cannot
ﬁnd Mad or Conﬁdential. .
Next let us venture into the reference room. Here inthis
hushed, vaulted chamber, we ﬁnd the true scholars of the
university—earnest, dedicated young men and women who
"care for only one thing in the world: the pursuit of knowledge.
Let us eavesdrop for a moment on this erudite -couple
poring over heavy tomes at the corner table. Hush‘!-' She
speaks: ‘ ’
SHE: Whatcha readin’, hey? ’ . ,
HE: “The Origin of Speciesl” You ever read it?
SHE: No, but I seen the movie. - , , -
HE: Oh.

SHE: Philip Morris?

HE: Of corris! ,

our way homeward-a triﬂe weary, perhaps, but enlightened
and renewed and better citizens for having spent these happy

hours in the library. Aloha, library, aloha! ©Max S,m,ma,,_1956

I Peake Directs Knox, Michigan Housing

"New Dorm Plan Set

A former member of the Federal Housing Administra-
tion, Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld knows his real estate.
Obviously he knows how to get it. But he hired Dr. Charles
Peake. because Peake knows how to use it. ' ‘

- The assistant chancellor was instrumental in establish-
ing at the University of Michigan the “Michigan House
Plan” widely known as a program for making college dor-
mitory life part of the total edu-9
cational program.

He is also/ the creator of the

Knox College program. There,
eight students are assigned to four
rooms aﬂoor with their own pri-
vate lounge. -
Large View Needed ,

“Students who come to a Uni-
versity must get a larger view” of
their education, Peake expressed
himself. They must learn to study
in areas conducive to contempla-
tion and concentration. They must
learn to live together and to adjust
to changes in living) modes, he
said, in effect. _ '

He was the first faculty resi-
dent advisor in the new resident
halls which were in the process
of being built when he arrived
at Michigan where his« position
as assistant dean of the College

of Lierature, Science, and the '

Arts, gaye him sway over 6,700
students, the largest single group
in the University.

'_,, The newly-appointed assistant
‘ chancellor developed the famed

“West Quadrangle” which consist-
ed of eight separate “houses,” each
with 120 to 140 students.

member lived on each ﬂoor, setting
the academic tone and discipline.
A woman as social director of each
house established the ‘ so-called
“social” attitude among the men.

Grad Students Used
On each ﬂoor, there was also a
graduate student who served as
assistant resident advisor——such
students are chosen from varied
ﬁelds of interest to lend variety to
the dorm situation.
In the Knox College Plan, one
faculty member living in a private

.. charge of two buildings housing

students. In each building,
there are eight students to a ﬂoor,
three ﬂoors. Each group of eight
has a private lounge—in the*new-
est experiments, ﬁreplaces are i-n-
cluded in the lounges, but Peake is
not so sure they are practical
enoughto merit the cost expended.

»The faculty advisor lives with
his family in a contemporary
house‘ behind the dorms. The
houes is valued at $18,500.

As for government in the dor-
mitories, each suite elects a rep-
resentative who in turn votes for

them.’
Councils For Dorms
-Dorm Councils only function

within the dorms and only hous-
ing problems ‘come within their

jurisdiction.’ But they often plan

parties in the dorms for social
life; instructors and advisors often
drop in for bull sessipns.
According to an enthusiastic
freshman pre - medical student
whom this writer interviewed,
women are invited frequently to
the dorms. Paul Norris described

' one party: f‘0n the ﬁrst ﬂoor

people sit around and play cards
or_ chat around; on the second
ﬂoor they can dance to a small‘
band in the lounge and get re-
freshments. Everyone. seems to
have a good time.”

The lounges are constantly qpen
for bull sessions; but rooms are for_
the sole use of studying and sleep-
mg.

‘‘Not enough students know how
to study,” Dr. Peake asserted.

“Few can concentrate on a sub--

ject for a solid hour.” Best possi-

ble conditions are provided in the

dorms for relaxation and study.
Frosh Live in Dorms

All freshmen are required to
live in the dormitories, because
“the ﬁrst year is terribly import-
ant” to help the student develop
his goals, Peake stated. The turn-
over among the men is usually
good; approximately ﬁfty per cent
of the student men join fraternities
in their, advanced years at Knox,
opening room for new. freshmen
moving into the dorms.

For the women, one large apart-
ment house is provided, although
another building will soon be built
for_ them Peake stated. A special
hotel has been purchased there for
married students and their wives.

These are the two popular pro-

rams with which Dean Peake has

Dennis Zymboly, one of the All-

Tells About
Challenging

, Philosphy

Among Dr. Peake’s more
prominent qualities is mobili-
ty.
After having combined with

a an architect to design an ultra-

modern home in Ann Arbor,
he was offered the “challenge”
at Knox College. Despite that he
and his family, had"'not lived in
the home (hada View on top of a
hill ﬁve miles around) even a
year, he accepted the Knox posi-
tion without any qualms, _saying,

i in effect, he wouldn’t be a slave

to a building.
The Peakes have just recently
moved into a -ranch-type bunga-

low which he designed. Yet, with
the Knox Renaissance well under-

way, he accepted the position at
Pitt ,and must sell the second
He’ll probably have
more difficulty ﬁnding a plot of
land in Pittsburgh than at any
other place.
New Man Like Changes

But he likes changes for the
personalchallenge that they give
him. Enthusiastic about anything
he takes up, the .appointee ex-
pressed surprise at being ,given
the Pitt job: “I never thought of
going out (if the academic area.”

His whole educational philos-
however, expresses the.
’same type of freedom and move-
ment he expresses in his archi-
tecture. “The nice thing about
educational institutions is that .
you canchange them,” he em-
phasized while walking along

' the Knox College viewing the

rapidly growing campus.

In a small college, one must
measure objectives carefully and
constantly; the goals must be de-

- ﬁned, and administration and fa-

culty must know exactly what
objectives are ‘set up and what
must be deevloped within the stu-

dent. “The secret of intellect and

social growth is-_ motivation for

lpurposeful learning,” he empha-

sized. V .
It is the job of careful counsel-
ing to gain insight into special
aptitudes and interests of students
and to relate them ‘to speciﬁc
goals, he continued.
Far too often, Dr. Peake point-
ed" out, students have entered

ﬁelds to which they are com-
pletely unsuited, because of
family pressures. He cautioned,
for example, that the student
who ﬁnds himself inadequate. in
an engineering course should be
guided into another ﬁeld of the
University to which he is more
suited.

Arrangements should be made
to guide students so that an ori-
ginal sense of failure born of too
high goals can be turned into a
feeling of success in other Uni-
versity areas._ '

The‘ problem often presents it-
self of the student who ‘sets his

goals too low, "and, thus, fails\to,

experience the full intellectual
growth of which"he is capable,
Peake brought out during the
conversation. _ \
Advising, Counseling Differ
He pointed out the vast diff-
erence between advising students
in curriculum at the beginning of
semesters or occasionally through-
out the year and guiding them to
those values, that provide a most
extensive intellectual experience.
Students must be given a
“burning desire” for understand-
ing, Dr. Peake stated, enraptur-
ed with the prospect of ﬁnding .
students to so direct. Unfor-
tunately, the practical philos-
opher stated, something too
often “doesnft happen”,to those

- challenging him.

people with special competence.

Counseling must work on the
“referral principal”. Professors
who realize a problem must know
immediately to whom they can re-
fer a student for further guidance,
and the student who leaves a
University because of incompati-
bility of some sort leaves “always
with a sense of failure.”

Problem Most Important
‘Peake considers this problem
one. of great importance in the
intellectual situation _of the Uni-
versity.

At Knox college, there a.re
full-time counselors. In other
school situations, admissions
departments evian conduct pre-

program, however, can be far

easier used in a small College

than a large University.

Close contacts and intimate re-
lationships are important between
students and faculty members in
order to, develop that “burning

desire” which comes of atmos-

phere conductive to. study and to
assure “permanent goals” for.in-
dividuals. ~ ~

This is Dr. 'Peake’s_ primary
educational philosophy- when he
speaks of it, his square jaw sets
ﬁrmer, the line§ in ‘his face grow
ta,ut —-— it’s his life work and his
life philosophy. And it is always

Comments Given on Many Subjects

,Versed in all aspects of student activities in the universi-
ties where he has held academic positions, Dr. Peake ran the_
gamut in discussing general practices and attitudes of extra

A and co-curricular programs. Here, abbreviated, are sofme of
his comments concerning a variety of subjects:

Registration-—“In order to build up residential students
an extensive scholarship program should be in effect.”

Student Government — “Stability
and Continuity are signiﬁcant
problems.” A means must be de-
vised to.train students in broad
aspects of government programs.
Student government has as its

 primary responsibility, “the devel-

in a community relationship.” It
is,a “kind of small microcosm,

' where they (students) learn to de-

velop programs for common good.”
“Student opinions and needs
should be voiced and given to ad-
ministration without administra-
tion losing its responsibility.”
Young Democrats and Young Re-
publicans —- “They’re conventional
organizations.” '
Religion——“There is a legitimate
area for strong programs in ‘the
general area of religion.” Such
programs must be appropriate and
in character with institutions that
are not sectarian universities.”
Dr. Peake pointed out an exten-
sive program of academic courses
offered within the Humanities re-
quirements at Knox College con-
cerning such topics as “Great
Ideals in the Non-Christian Re-
ligion” and “Types of Religious

Philosophy.” ~

 

One “can’t realistically separate
spiritual development ‘of students
from the secular education they
receive.” '
Honor, System-—Taking ﬁrm hold
at Knox College since its inception
ﬁve years ago: ‘,‘requires a great
deal of energy and a certain de-’
votion.” ‘

Book Store—“A good bookstore
should provide an insight into the
intellectual life of the University.”
Dr. Peake remarked on the large
number of high quality books ‘ap-
pearing in pock‘et—book _editions
within the means of students.

Publications—“The big job ‘of all
student editors is to learn princi-
ples of editorial responsibility.”
Although he does not believe in
censorship, Peaketdoes stress the
need of editorial responsibility—
the obligation for disseminating
the truth. -

“A paper is not a methodical de-
vice to transmit events over tele-
type (in reference to extensive use
of wire services in college papers).
Students should “dig up the news”
for “personal training and for get-
ting real rewards out of it.”_
. ,, , _

  

Nationality Rooms —-‘ Creates re-
spect and proper attitude toward
nationality groups. “A ﬁne waly of
meeting the situation in a nice
manner.”
Student

Employment and ‘ Job

Placement-—“They should be‘ re- ,

lated with counseling.” ‘
Fraternities and Sororities-—They
prove important on campuses.
Schools should attempt to assure
good facilities for these groups al-
though they should not necessarily
supply funds for houses. '
Faculty‘-Student Relations——“Open
House Night” is a steady thing at
Knox. In the fall, each group of
students -m‘eets with their particu-
lar counselor in an initial get-to-
gether. The relations continue
throughout the year.

Park Hotel.

He has been carrying on consistent correspondence with ,
New York-architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and will
behere to see renovations being. made over the summer. 

According to, Peake, it would be far better to have the
remodeling done before students move in than to have
workmen hammering away around them. But, if the time _
lapse is too short for the renovation program, students. may '
either move into facilities at a later date than in September

around them.

Three Stories Considered
From a general impression,
Peake feels conﬁdent that the ﬁrst
three stories will be ready for ac-
cupancy in September. , A.
Although ﬁnal plans for initial
changes will be laid with the
architects next week when Peake
arrives in town, dining facilities
and a few meeting ‘rooms will
probably be the ﬁrsbfacilities open
to students—with proper atmos-
phere. ‘, ‘\ i I
In discussions held ‘Saturday
night and through Sunday,
Peake continuously emphasized
the idea of “atmosphere.” He
pointed out to this reporter a
small dining hall. in the Hotel
Custer ‘which had been decor-
ated in a colonial Dutch motif
with a large,-- gaily-decorated
kitchen cupboard and a stone
well from which waitresses drew
ice water.

Nine—year old Terry Anne Peake whispered an excited
but shy “ahh” when she heard that she would be able to visit

whether she would like to see big skyscrapers every day

replied haltingly, “I guess so.” Her father reminded her that I in

“Things sound exciting.” Mrs.

ment, of Dr. Peake’s appointment,
a department store and a milk
company have already written
them; so they already have _a

Good Cook Comes

Certainly, Pittsburgh will gain
another good cook when she ar-
rives permanently in July. But
she will be ‘here earlier. A ‘charm-
ing hostess and avigorous con-
versationalist, Mrs. Peake will fly
to Pittsburgh with her husband on

all fan, he can still hit a mean
ball and play a fast game in his
early forties, so friends say. '
Although he played the game
high school, he didn’t ﬁnd the
time in college, so he didn’t go
out for the team at the University
of Michigan. ,

While his sports tendencies are
‘toward’ baseball, his academic
:leaning in English lies mostly in
lthe Eighteenth Century literature.
He teaches an Eighteenth Century
Course at Knox. The group of
eight meets in his office in round
table discussion -— the best way
to conduct such a class, he feels.

The newly-appointed assistant
chancellor has no particular favo-
rite writer in that period; rather,
he approaches the subject from
the whole, bringing into his
courses the political, scientiﬁc,
and economic ramiﬁcations which
affected the literature and vice
versa.

The course begins actually with

branches out through literature to

Salvaterra, Kaliden,

Lewis Fight for QB

By DON KAISERMAN
The key to the “T” is the quarterback. Last season, Pete
Neft took over the signal-caller post in the Panther version

of the T-formation at mid—season and sparked the Blue and~

Gold to the Sugar Bowl.

This year, the all-important position is up for grabs.
Two veterans, Corny Salvaterra and Darrell Lewis, appear
to have an edge over their less-experienced rivals.

Salvaterra was being counted
upon to lead the team last year
after being dubbed a “sophomore
sensation” in 1954. In fact, some
pre—season prognosticators went
so far as'to rate him as one of the
East’s top offensive backs.

National Magazine Praises Corny

_However, the 6-0, 195—pound
senior failed to live up to these
rave notices, and apparently was
suffering from an overly—cautious
outlook. More aften than not, he
preferred to run with the ball in-
stead of heaving it on intend

throws the nice, light, fast pass
that we look for.”

The Homestead ﬂedgling already
has shown enough defensive abil-
ity to be considered on a par with
Salvaterra and Lewis in that de-
partment. As far as calling the
plays is concerned, Kaliden has
a Phi Eta Sigma key to prove his
capability. .

At the moment, though, due to
Salvaterra’s injury, Lewis is
holding down the number one

' spot. A left-handed ﬂinger from
Wilkinsburg, Lewis is also a
hard runner. But, as yet, he has

‘failed to show that he can be a
competent passer.

Lewis’ biggest asset is that he
provides great leadership and runs
the team well, as was demonstrat-
ed in the closing seconds at New
Orleans last January. The 5-10,

as a steadying inﬂuence.

On°the other side of the experi-
ence ledger is Bill Kaliden, a 6-0,
185-pound sophomore from Home-
stead. Without a single varsity
game under his belt, Kaliden is
already one of the squad’s most
publicized players.

;.:Lewismen to  Initiate
  Home Season Today

I By AL ABRAMS ,

The Panther baseball team has been battling two factors

so far this season and have not done too well against either.
The ﬁrst is that scheduled by the athletic department
and the second is the unscheduled_weather which cancelled
most of the spring training and has continued to plague the

--¢—_*ewin ball games, the right com-

squad .into the season.

The home opener with Geneva was cancelled yesterday
due to snow, and the Panthers will open their season at
home today, weather permitting at Mellon Field. Starting

xtime of the game will be 3 p.m.

Since the ﬁrst two weeks of- the 1956 ‘campaign with the

Panthers losing ﬁve out of the ﬁrst¢

six ball games, the question of
what is wrong with the Panther
baseball team has been asked by
a number of the sportsminded
student body.

Lewis Needs Combination

Coach Bobby Lewis, before the
1956 season got underway, was
looking for a better season than
last year, but so far has been un-
able to come up with the right
combination of pitching and hit-
ting.

Every time the batters are
having a ﬁeld day, the pitching
seems to collapse and when the
pitchers have good stuff on the
ball, the batters seem to fall in-
to a lethargic mood. In order" to

bination of both will have to be
found.‘ .

Another fault that has slowed
down the Pitt nine has been the
wildness of their pitchers in the
opening stages of the games. The
squad has lost four out of ﬁve balls
games—due to this wildness.

Training Curtailed

This can partly be blamed, as
can the rest of their woes, on‘ the
fact - that spring training was
greatly curtailed because of the
bad weather. ‘
In. the past week’s games, the
Panthers looked better than at any
‘ other time during the season. After
a game was called off with St. Vin-
cent’s ‘due to" a snow storm, the
Pittites traveled to Bucknell. It
_,was there the team won their ﬁrst

booming bat of Bill Schmitt and
the twirling of Ronnie Moog.
Schmitt came up in the third
inning with two on and smacked
a triple to drive in both runners.
Thenrin the sixth,‘ he stepped to ‘
the plate, with the bases loaded
and slammed a grand slam home
run, to give him six runs-baa-
ted-in of the ten that the Pan-
thers acquired.

Moog pitched a good ball game
and only weakened in the ﬁfth in-
ning to give up ﬁve runs. Other
than that, ‘Bucknell didn’t have
anything and had only ﬁve hits for
the afternoon. ~

Panthers Meet ‘Reds’
Then the Panthers journeyed to

a Saturday encounter, and were
looking for revenge of a defeat
from last year. As it turned out the
Panthers will have to wait until
next year to get their revenge.
They dropped a 3-1 decision.

Hartwig Award Goes to   Sowell

Schmitt,-iiikowski
Honored at Athletic
Fete Monday Night

Arnie Sowell, Pitt’s world
renowned half-miler, was
given the highest athletic
award of the University Mon-
day night at,a giant banquet
held at Webster Hall. ‘

Sowell was awarded the
Charles C. Hartwig Award ”for
having done most to promote and
sponsor thebest interests of ath-
letics at the University of Pitts-
burgh.”" 4

Bill Schmitt, football guard and
leading baseball hitter, was given
the Athletic Committee Award» for

.being the student “who has main-

tained the best combination of
high scholarship, all—around ath-
letic ability, sportsmanship, and
aptitude.”
Special Merit Awarded

Chester Zukowski, Col. ’56,‘ who
has been head cheerleader for two
years was given a special merit
award. ~Zukowski served last year
as student representative to the
Athletic Committee.

Approximately 350 athletes were
in the banquet crowd of 500 to
see the top Pitt athletes receive
special commendation and to cheer
the Sugar Bowl football team who

.received a special tribute from

assistant band director Benny Be-
nack and his musicians. They
played “Hail to Pitt,” dixie-land
style.

Sowell, the Panthers’ big hope-’

ful in the 1956 Olympics in Mel-
bourne will have his name carved
on the Charles C. Hartwig walk
between Heinz Chapel and the
Cathedral. The track star is the
ﬁrst junior to be so honored.
