Magee—Women’s Hospital is undergoing extensive renovation as part of the University Health Center expansion plans

House Bill .158 would   Put Appropri

By CHRIS CLINTON '

There’s much talk going around
these days about the appropriations
crisis, as ideas are being shufﬂed
around by university officials and
members of the state legislature.
One of these ideas that is currently
in debate is House Bill 158.

This constitutional "amendment-

was first introduced to the General
Assembly in Harrisburg on
February 7, 1980 by Rep. Ronald R.
Cowell. This amendment ,if passed,
“will make the four state-related
schools part of the General Ap-
propriations instead of the current
non—prefered status,’_’ Cowell said
in an interview.

This means that Pitt, Penn State,

budgeted along with the essential

-state services which fall in the

general fund category.

Cowell outlined his bill in a letter
to the editor that appeared’ in The
Pitt News on July 30, l980. He
wrote that his bill _“will give due
recognition to the state-related
schools as integralxparts of our
Commonwealth’s system of higher
education.”

His bill would also “close the ex-
isting loophole in our constitutional
obligation to pass a balanced

' budget by including in the General

-Appropriations Bill all of the
significant expenditures of state
government which are to be funded

' by General Fund Revenues.”

Expansion Begins With
Folk Clinic Renovations

By NOLA WERNER

The University Health Center’s
$250 million expansion plan, which
will come before City Council for
formal’ approval in October or

* November, will begin with the
external renovations of Falk Clinic
next spring.

-The groundbreaking is expected
next April or May if the Health
System Agency approves the plan
by the end of their board meeting
.in March, said Dr. Donald F. Leon,
Health Center president and_ dean

of the University of Pittsburgh‘

Medical School. a

V One of the controversies which
has arisen between the Oakland
community ant the Health Center is
a dispute over Presbyterian -
University Hospital’s plans to use
the lsaly plant site for valet parking

and out-of-house office
according to Leon.

The old ice cream factory, which
presently lies vacant above the
lsaly store, was designated "by
Oakland Directions Inc. as an area
of opportunity that can not be used
for institutional pruposes, accord-
ing to Sandy Phillips, the executive
director of People’s Oakland.

People’s Oakland and the South
Oakland Citizen's Council. (SOCC)
are two of the community organiza-
tions who are opposed to the
Health Center’s use of the lsaly
plant site. .

If the Health Center uses the A

lsaly site they will be breaking their
commitment not to use residential

SOCC member and a member of

DA Hires Pih‘ Prof
to Study Jury Verdicts

By CLARE GLEASON
Pitt Newslstaff Writer ‘
-Pitt Professor Raymond E. Owen
has been appointed by the
Allegheny "County District Attorn-
ey’s office to direct a scientific
study. of county criminal court
juries to determine whether verdicts

’ are based on facts or racial or other

bias.‘ V
Funding for the project will come

from -a $25,000 grant from the.

Richard King Mellon Foundation.
The study will be conducted by
the University Center for Social and
Urban Research (UCSUR) under
the supervision of ViJai Singh. It is
the first study of its kind to be con-
ducted in the county. p
“The hypothesis of the study is to

' 1, systematically analyze the peremp-

tory challenge system and whether

1 ~ or not this system results in biased

juries,” according to Steven Man-
ners from UCSUR.

A peremptory challenge is the

tion to his bill by “key university

officials” and legislative leaders.

“The university is concerned

about the control (of the university)

, issue. This bill doesn’t discuss the

control issue.” _

‘ Cowell has seen support from
legislative leaders like House
minority leader Leroy Irvis , but the
lack of support from other leaders
is because, of the resistance of the
university he said. ‘

“People won't consider it unless

the legislature. They have immense
lobbying power if the choose to use
it.” ’
Cowell reassured that House Bill
158 will not take any independence
away from the university: “If the
state eante_d control, it could be
done by going back and changing
legislation concerning state-related

schools.” He termed the university‘

official’s fear “unfounded.”

“The school has a difficult time
making decisions if they don't
know how much money they’re get-
ting until September or October.”

related schools

prospective juror without explanan-

- tion. The number of peremptory

challenges varies with the alleged
crime.

“The idea of juries and peremp-

tory ‘challenges is not intended to
produce a representative and un-
biased jury. It is attempting to pro-
duce offsetting biases that will
cancel one another out,” Owen
said. ,

The study was initiated because
the defense attorney of a man tried

for murder in the county last spring n

accused District Attorney Bob
'Colvi1le of systematicallly
discriminating against black jurors,
therby being unfair to black
defendants. V

The D.A. denied any systematic
policy of discrimination. ‘

Judge James R. McGregor ruled
that the county assistant pro-
secuters were in fact guilty of
discriminating against black jurors
for black defendants.

This ruling prompted the D.A. to

passed by June 30 of each fiscal
year for the following fiscal year.
Cowell said that if his bill is pass-
ed, the school will ‘be able to assess‘
their budget for the next fiscal year

because it will be a part of the‘

General Fund.
In the July 30 letter to The Pitt

News, Cowell wrote that state-‘

related schools faced being held
hostage by the state government .

“We are witnessing once again
the hostage situation that has con-
fronted the university community
on several other occasions since the
mid-sixties.” Cowell said in the in-
terview that his bill will put an end
to this situation.

The parking facilities will be

The hospitals will be funded by a 20
percent equity and the remaining
80 percent through hospital auth-
ority bonds which “will have a
fairly mild impact on the patients’
daily care dollar,” Leon said.

“We are the last hospital group
to undertake expansion. Forbes,

therapy and an X-ray department
will _be_funded 100 percent by a
public bond issue and no equity.

‘Due "to the present high cost of
operating these services in the
university space, the construction
of a new clinic would only mean an
approximate 10 percent increase
over present costs, according to
Leon. ‘

However, Phillips said she feels
the Health Center. is taking
advantage of a provision in ODI’s
Oakland Plan" which allows for the
renewal of institutions.

The construction of a parking
garage on Terrace and Darragh
streets, _along with some of the
other massive expansion the
Health Center is planning, would
be detrimental to the community
and goes beyond renewal of an

‘institution, according to Phillips.

The proposal at this time calls for
a new Children’s Hospital building
so that support services, such as
child psychiatry, which’ are pres-
ently scattered around Oakland,
can be moved back into the
hospital. The old Children’s Hos-

pital would then be converted into

an outpatient primary care unit for
children. I

“The ﬁrst two phases of our
four-phase plan will mean an
enormous increment of pediatric
care,” Leon said.

In 15 to 20 years, projected plans .

call for a new building for Falk
Clinic, with Children’s Hospital
receiving the old Falk building for
expanded pediatric services.

The Eye and Ear Hospital would I

vacate its present location for a new
building._ The Presbyterian -
University "Hospital would then
take over the old" Eye and Ear
building to expand their support
services. and post-operative care
with a slight increase in beds, Leon
explained. ~

The plan will mean .40 to 50
percent more space. '
‘The expansion in capability is
towards outpatient care with
replacement of inpatient care
facilities/’Leon said. I

“The hospitals are over 50 years
old. We now have 750 square feet
of hospital space per patient and
we need 1150 square feet in order
to avoid curtailing support serv-
ices,” he added.

A controversial part of the plan
calls for the construction of parking
garages. - .

“A peak parking deﬁcit that

‘approaches 5,000 cars a day is

expected by 1985. We are planning
on building about 3,000 parking
spaces by 1985,” Leon said.

Before the plan can be‘ enacted,
it must ﬁrst receive the approval of
the state Health Systems Agency, a
national system of health care
planning, according to Paul
Girdany, a community health
advocate for the Community Health
Advocacy Network (CHAN)
formerly Pittsburgh's Patients’
Rights Program.

One of the program objectives of
CHAN ' is to increase community
involvement in the Health Systems

.. .;..,,........,...... o.......IR..... 

Agency, which by law must have a

membership that is 51 percent
consumers of health care versus
providers of health care.

-“We are not opposed to the
expansion per se, but rather to the
harmful effects it will have on the
community without compensating
for them,” explained Girdany.

The Health Center should make
its hospitals more accessible to the
residents of the area.

“There are doctors in those‘
hospitals who refuse to treat
anyone on medical assistance, and
some of the hospitals have not
fulﬁlled the Hill-Burton Act,"
according to Girdany.

The Hill-Burton Act ia a law
which provides free and below-cost
hospital care for people of lower
income status. “In the long term it
(the expansion program) will
inﬂate hospital costs, which will be
passed on to the patients.
Meanwhile, there is a community
that can't receive health care,” he
added.

The community should be
guaranteed improved service be-
fore they agree to an expansion
plan, he added.

In Support of Anderson

By MIKE MALLINGER

Ed Kirtner walked into the
newsroom of The Pitt News looking
slightly tired and disheveled. He
said his hometown was Hampton,
Virginia, and that he was a
materials engineering graduate of
Virginia Tech‘ and he had bicycled

3,000 miles across the country in"

support of imdependent presiden-
tial candidate John Anderson.
Kirtner’s trek stared nine weeks
ago in‘ Portland, Oregon. He and
two friends, one his college room-
mate, ‘flew from ‘Virginia to

“Portland with their bicycles and

camping equipment. Although Kirt-
ner admitted the trio of Anderson

at thebegining, they covered bet-

" ween 60 to 90 miles a day.

“I’ve never done anything

. athletic in my life,” said Kirtner. ‘

Once underway , - they camped
along ‘the road for the first five
weeks. Sunburned and sore, they
challenged the northern /Wyoming
desert. Kirtner had never seen the
West before and said,“‘On bicycle
you go slow enough to absorb sur-

roundings and meet the people; The

Nebraska, when _ Kirtner’s two
friends decided to return to
Virginia Kirtner made plans to con-
tinue to Portland, Maine. It was in
Nebraska that he made contact with
the Anderson campaign. Kirtner’s
initial reaction of Anderson as
-“really intersting guy...quite amaz-
ing.” '

‘Kirtner spent the night in jail in
Grenell, Iowa--not a lawbreaker by
nature, he first asked the police if
he could set up his tent in the park
and they offered him a cushy cell in-
stead. He slept in jail that night and
showered at the fire station in the
morning.'His only complaint‘ was

that they locked him in at midnight. . ‘
supporters were a bit out of shape - I

g The plight of senior citizens
brought Kirtner into the world of

politics,’ he explained in his,

hometown he cut senior citzens’
lawns and afterwards listened to
them talk for hours. He became
sypathetic to their problems,
especially to their disdain for nurs-
ing homes. " I .

“If they (nursing homes) don’t
tear you apart, you're not human,”
he said. . V

(One of the planksiin Anderson’s

platform is toincrease tax‘ deduc- I

tions for families that take'care of
elderly relations.) ’

Politically, Kirtner is astute. As a
concerned citizen he has found peo-
ple “sitting on the fence” in this
election, and he finds Anderson the
“most realistic and pragmatic of
the candidates.”

“He does not say one thing on
the East coast and another on the
West coast.-” ‘ _

When confronted with the fact
that Anderson is running a poor
third in the race, he points out that
Anderson has ony one tenth the
funding of the other‘ conadidates
and,. and that coming voluntarily
from grassroots supporters. The in-
dependent candidate has raised six
million dollars to date.

As Kirtner nears the end of his
journey, things"are getting better.
No longer does he have tocamp

: out: he calls ahead and local Ander-
son supporters put him up for the

night. He was given a dinner in
Toledo androde on the press truck
in Chicago in a Labor Day parade
for Anderson. He added that he is
behind the scenes in this campaign
and is “not trying to get intothe cir-
cus.”

His only problemis one of fre-
quent morning ‘disorientation.
“sometimes I wake up and don’t
know where I am,” he said.

s A By.-RAY YOUNG
The Armenian-American» Club of

—  Pittsburgh and other Armenian-,
. Americans are trying to get an

Armenian’ nationality room in the

Cathedral, according to ‘Gerard

Koshlarian, president of the club.
Koshkarian has been raising

- funds to pay for the addition of an

Armenian nationality room. $5,000
has been raised so far for the room.
. However, that is not .enough

. ‘money .to construct a ‘ nationality‘

room. Dr. Maxine Bruhns, director

of the nationality rooms, said that L

the. current cost of a nationality
room is approximately $150,000.
To help raise the difference in

, funds Koshkarian said there will be.

an Armenian Festival Saturday,

Sept. 20 in the lower floor of the ‘

Stephen Memorial. ‘

The festival will begin at 6 p.m.
when Armenian food will be sold
and from 8-12 there will be Arme-

' ‘ nian folk dancing accompanied by

an Armenian band from

,_Cleveland. There will be a $2.50

door charge that will be used to pay

e_ for the band.

But not just any group can have a

‘ nationality. room; they must meet

certain criteria, according to

Bruhns “There must be a communi-

more accurate picture of a

psychiatric clinic, said Millie Sucov,
director of Volunteer Services and
Community Education at WPIC.
“Bringing ,_t_he community to
WPIC was the best way, to educate

_ the public _and provide patients with

a * normalized interac_tion,”said
Millie Sucov. . ' ,
The volunteers provide in-
patients with recreational activities
and act as a friend. One patient -said
he enjoyed talking with a volunteer

-more than a doctor or nurse
because he» knew the volunteers

ty in Pittsburgh which. represents

L the cultural heritage which wants to’

establish the room,” Bruhns said.
She. added that the culture or
geographic area must pre-date 1787
and that before any funds are- rais-
ed, Pitt must give formal permis-
sion for the group to try to build a
nationality room.

The Armenian-American Club,
organized in 1977 as a nonprofit
organization, has university permis-
sion and , according to Koshkarian,
they hope to raise all necessary
funds and pick the design for the
room in the next three years.

Bruhns said it takes anaverage of

ten years, from fund-raising to‘ the V‘
opening ceremony, for a nationality

room to be established. Today there

are 19 nationality rooms. All of A
_ them, ecxept the Early American

room, are on the first floor of the
Cathedral.

Bruhns -said all new nationality
rooms will be built on the third
floor of the Cathedral where ‘the
Early American room already is.
She added that the rooms will be
built’ on the third ﬂoonrather than
the second because the elevators can
be programmed to stop on the third
floor. - _

wanted to be there more and
weren’t.‘ just “doing their job”. Pa-

tients receive generally positive at- ~
' Vtitudes from the volunteers, Millie

Sucov said. - ' _
_ WPIC has about 75' regular
volunteers in areas such as

psychology, education, and social
work. There are two children’s, one
adolescent, and four adult pro-.
grams. Volunteers work an

average of four hqurs at a time, ~

twice a week.
Some of the various activities
that volunteers help with are: the

,liArmenian-Americans Trying For
 Nationality Room in Cathedral

the Armenian room will center
upon a specific period in Armenian
history Koshkarian said. The period
of the Armenian room will either be
11th or 12th century since Armenia
lost its independence to Turkey
shortly after this period,- according
to Koshkarian. »

The Armenian-American club a

more difficult time raising funds. a

than other nationality ‘groups since
there is no nation to donate money
to help construct the room,
Koshkarian said. »

Another problem facing
Armenian-Americans in‘ building
their’ room‘ is materials, according

7 .»to Koshkarian,: If they chooc to use 3 -
‘a special redstone predominent in ' _
Armenian architecture, they can-—

only get it in Soviet Armenia, which
be expensive.if not im-

plained.

Bruhns said other nationality
rooms are being planned. Among
them are an Israel room, an African
room, and a Ukrainian room. She
said that the Ukrainian community

is planning to complete their room V

by 1988 so that it opens during the
loooth anniversay year of Chris-
tianity in the Ukraine.

Opinion

Everything to Gain,
Nothing to Lose A

The University of Pittsburgh has everything to

‘ gain and nothing to lose by wholeheartedly support- -

ing the passage of H.B. 158, a bill currently under
discussion before the Pennsylvania General
Assembly. . I

The legislation, which would make Pitt and other
state—related universities a part of the Com-
monwealth’s_ general budget instead of the non-
preferred status that it know suffers, was introduced
by Rep. Ron Cowell as a cure-all to Pitts yearly
budgetary headaches. ~

The annual non-preferred appropriations waiting

game for Pitt, Penn State, Lincoln, and Temple
Universities could become a thing of the past if the
the schools would be considered among the essential
general budget items. ‘
Unfortunately for the Commonwealths students,
Cowell and the co-sponsors of the bill have met some
opposition from members of the Pitt administration.

, “The university is concerned about the control [of _
the university] issue. The bill doesn't discuss the con-

trol issue,” Cowell said.

‘State House Minority Leader K. Leroy Irvis ‘said
that the resisitance on the-ipart of the university has
been in part responsible for the lack of support -from
members of the legislature. ’

“People won’t consider it unless the university
supports it,” Cowell said.’
Cowell has time and time again insisted that the

‘bill will not in any way revoke power from the

university. ‘

“If the state wanted control, it could be done by
going back and changing legislation concerning the
state—related schools,” Cowell said.

It seems apparent that Cowell along with other
proponents of legislation favoring higher education‘

 G112 lﬂttt 

Page 10-.—Wednesday, September 17, 1980

have no alterior motives in proposing this bill. It
also seems about time for Pitt’s admininistration
along with the administrations of the other schools to
swallow their suspicions and recognize the ever in-
creasing financial burden being placed on their stu-
dent with each and every tuition increase.

With students being forced to face a tuition in-
crease every year for the past five years, Pennsylva-
nians are being driven to out of state schools where
they can receive the same education at a much lower
price.

For years, Pitt along with other state related
universities have been held at the mercy of state
legislators, many of whom fail to recognize the sorry-

status of higher education here in the Com-

monwealth.

Pitt dependence on state appropriations for one-
third of its annual budget yearly loses out with the
Commonwealth. And yearly, the students-bear the
final brunt of this monetary situation.

The final decision rests with the Pitt adminstra-

. tion— whether to accept the word of Cowell and the

other legislators with a genuine interest in the ‘sur-
vival of higher education

' To the Editor: . .
. , Thank God for PMAP! An inci-

dent that occuredion my floor this
week has prompted me to.write this
‘letter to praise the work of the peer
medical aides. But this praise is not
without some criticism of Student
Health (namely, their allocation of
funds). I

A girl on my floor suddenly fell ill
to the point of passing out. Im-
mediately, the Campus Police and
the Rescue Squad were called. In
the interim (approximately twenty-

five minutes), I called my girlfriend
who is ‘a paramedic and a member

of PMAP. She was on the floor »

within seconds, administering first
aid to this girl until the Rescue
Squad arrived. It was a stroke of
luck that my girlfriend was home,
just at the time we needed her most.

But what would have happened if s

she hadn’t have been home? I
doubt that anyone on the floor was
capable of doing what this medical
aide did. Besides giving excellent
medical assistance to this girl, she

saved us from what could possibly
have been a chaotic scene of panic
and possible hysteria. She took
command of the situation, calming
and reassuring all of us that
everything would be alright I
Unfortunately, not everyone liv-
ing ’ in the residence halls knows
where to locate a peer medical aide.
An article in the'Sept. 12 edition of

_ The Pitt News, entitled “Students

Run Medical Aid Program,” stated
that, “The purpose of PMAP is to
provide immediate response first

-aid on campus...”. How is it possi-
ble to provide immediate response
first aid to someone if there is no
way to locate these people (except,
of course, on weekendslll? The
peer _medical aides are a group of
highly skilled paramedics, emergen-
cy medical trainees, and advanced
first aiders who know how to do
more than put a splint on a finger.
Their knowledge and skill are
definitely being stifled!

Given sufficient funding from
Student Health, a list of all peer

is   Availability of Medical Aides Inadequate?

medical aides, their locations on
campus, and their.-, phone numbers
could _be compiled and distributed
to every Resident Assistant in the
university dormitories. The Resi-
dent Assistant in turn could call at-
tention to this list at their floor
meetings. They could also post this
list so that everyone, not just a for-
tunate few, would know where to
contact these people in case another
emergency situation of this type
should ever happen to occur again.

.WritersciysRep. Not Aware’ of Responsibilities

students have short memories. sent people, if representation is the

(Editor’s note: This letter was
written in response to a letter writ-
ten by James Knepper, member of
Pa. House of Representatives,
published on Sept. 5)

I recently read the letter you
wrote to the Pitt News editor
(published September 5, 1980). In
the letter you made various points
which indicate that you have some
misconceptions and are not aware
of the responsibilities of a State
Representative. Permit me to
elaborate.

I. You begin by stating that you are
insulted by the request for your

I. position and indicated that the Pitt

There is no need to be insulted. In
fact you should welcome the oppor-
tunity to have thousands of voters
read what you have done in support
of educational institutions. As far
as Pitt students having short
memories for something that hap-
pened three years ago, consider that
most students weren't even of
voting age at that time and that the
average student spends only four
years in college.

‘ 2. You state that no students ac-

tively volunteered to work in your
campaign. Are you implying that in
order to gain your support on an
issue, constituents should help you
in your campaign? That appears to
me to-be a strange method to repre-

form for this policy.

3. You claim that the students

have failed to do their job, although
you do not say what their job is. I.
presume you mean that they -are
supposed to run to Harrisburg and
convince the General Assembly that
there should be additional funding.
If that_is true, I'd like to know why
we're paying you thousands of
dollars. a year to attend the General
Assemblies. 4

4. You state that the members of
the General Assembly do'not nor-
mally react to funding for higher
education on a crisis basis.Three
cheers for our quick acting
le_gi..;;..::rs. They did a fine job of

reacting quickly to Philadelphia's

‘ transportation problems.

5. You state that the Pitt students
should have a hard-working com-
mittee already at work in the
General Assembly for the 1981-1982
budget, as if the students don’t have
any otherhard work to do here in
Pittsburgh.

I am not a student at Pitt, but'I
graduated in 1979. Without support
from the state and federal govern-
ments, I would not have been able
to obtain my mechanical engineer-
ing degree. I feel that now that I am
working, I am able to reimberse the
government with my tax dollars,
and the taxes that I pay as an
engineer are much higher than those
I would have paid without a degree.

There is definitely a payback for

» support of education. However, the

payback is not short term, so it
takes a representative with good in-
sight into long term benefits to sup-
port education.

There ate so many more benﬁts
to supporting education that it
would take pages more to detail. I
realize what these benefits are and I
urge you and your asssociates to
continue to support education and
to inform the people what these
beneﬁts are.

‘Student Media Need Freedom From Administration

By NICK ARNETT

“I don’t feel like sending $36
million to a university that doesn’t
know what good taste is -and
doesn’t have the guts to inform its
students what good taste is.”

Those words came from (then
State Representative Russell J.

LaMarca after he announced (some ,

years ago) that he would withhold
all money from Pitt if any state
funds were used to finance the
“obscenities and vulgarities” he
claimed to have found in student
publications.

It’s clear that pressure could be
exerted upon student media by
those who hold the purse-strings,
despite denials from university of-
ficials of any intention to control
the content of student media. The
administration, board of trustees,
and state legislature regard The Pitt
News as the “official” student
newspaper, so they retain an in-
terest in what appears in the paper.
However, there have been subtle

and obvious attempts to influence
content.

The new media board established
by the administration holds the
power to" “approve. . .editorial and
advertising policies of all recognized
student media and pub1ic_ations.” It
approves budgets and is the
publisher of student media with
“the encumbent responsibilities
and requisite authority.” The
board" may adopt a laissez-faire

policy toward the content of

student media, but there is a clear
option of exercising tighter control.

For a , newspaper or other
medium to be truly free, as implied
in the First Amendment, there must

be “no law” to abridge it. Only a -

full independent newspaper at Pitt
could be free. «

There is a difference between
separating The Pitt News from the
administration and separating it
from the university. The Pitt News
should be a voice of the communi-

qty, reflecting the views of all parts _

of the university—.-students, faculty
and administrators. To adequately
do so, the paper must not be super-
vised by any particular faction. The
administration has the resources to
produce its own publications, but it
should never count The Pitt News
as one of them.

_ Many of the nation's college and
university student papers are in-
dependent—for example, the Har-
vard Crimson. In recent years,
there has been a trend toward in-
dependence, but the transition has
been difficult for many. .

An.independent paper must be
financial success. There would be
no student government or ad-
ministration available to_ bail out
the paper if costs exceeded income.
To make ends meet, independent

papers sometimes begin to charge.

students. As might be expected,
students have not been pleased to
pay for something" they used to
receive f‘free. ’ ’

At Pitt, the student newspaper

isn't free, though it has that ap-
pearance. It's supported by the stu-
dent activities fee. ‘An independent
Pitt News would free those dollars

-to be -spent elsewhere, or the fee

could’ be lowered.

An independent Pitt News would
have to maintain high quality—if it
didn't, it wouldn’t sell; if it didn't
sell, it would fold. L

Student Activities Director Andy
Smith envisions another result of an
independent Pitt News.

"I would speculate,” he said,
“that before long, a vacuum on
campus would spring up. That’s a
guess. I’ve seen that in other stu-
dent activities.”

Multiple student papers are not
unusual—UCLA has eight. A little
competition for The Pitt ‘News
might be the best thing that has
happened to it. ' A newspaper
fighting to sell copies has to do a
good job; Smith suggests that there
are not enough interested, compe-
tent students to operate, another

campus paper. There could be
more, if the administration took the
proper step.

The power to exist as the student
newspaper should not rest in the
hands of the administration. Super-
vision, through a media board, is
not the way to assure the jour-
nalistic quality of The Pitt News.
Instead, the university should

employ its time-honored method of '

inculcating responsibility—teach! If
Pitt’s administration wants a high-
quality student press, it should im-
prove the quality of writing courses,
rather than attempting to enforce it.

The administration cannot legally
enjoy traditional publisher's rights.
It has failed to include that fact in
the media board’s Constitution, so
the potential exists for interference
with the freedom of student- media.
If the administration doesn’t
refrain from such influence, then
The Pitt News and other student
media should take steps toward true
independence.

o Rep. Would Vote for Increased Taxes to Provide Money .'

‘x

To the Editor:

I am appalled by the action of
Governor Thornburgh in using the
state-related universities as pawns in
his budget dispute with the General
Assembly.

The Governor is opposed to rais-
ing taxes, but he is unwilling to trim
state spending by less than one per-
cent in order to fully provide the ap-

propriations for these institutions. .

Months ago, when the Governor
released his budget to the General
Assembly, it was obvious to budget
analysts that sufficient revenues did
not exist. Even though he was
aware of this situation, he pursued
the adoption of an unbalanced

Bill Would Help State-Relateds  

To the Editor:

I have been a supporter of addi-
tional funds for the University of
Pittsburgh ever since I joined the
Pennsylvania Legislature in 1968.

I not only support additional
money for higher education, but I
am willing to vote for increased
taxes to fund it. During the 1977
budget crisis, on at least six occa-
sions, I voted in favor of additional
income taxes to provide funds for
higher education among other
things.

The problem is that most
members of the legislature will not

budget on‘ the basis that the Penn-
sylvania Liquor Control Board
would provide him with an addi-
-tional $26 million by raising the
retail price of alcoholic beverages
by ten cents a bottle. I do not blame
the LCB for rejecting this scheme
because they have been subjected to
tremendous criticism of inefficiency
and overpricing of their merchan-
dise. ‘

In order to round out his revenue
requirements, the Governor wishes
to raise licensing and other fees that
affect various trades and industries.
The fee increases, as proposed by
Mr. Thornburgh, in many
categories amount to several hun-
dred percent. Consequently, he

vote for additional taxes because of
a fear of reprisal in the next elec-
tion. The voting, taxpaying public
is not at all interested in paying ad-
ditional taxes toprovide additional
funds to the state government for
including higher
education. A legislator is merely an
extension of his constituency.
During my campaigns, I have
found that most voters feel that we
are spending too much money on
higher education and many other
things. I disagree with my consti-
tuents and I have repeatedly voted

for both additional funds and addi-

tional taxes because I think a
legislator should have the courage

should not have been surprised
when a majority of the legislators of
his own party refused to endorse th
proposal. ‘ ~

While the Governor wishes to
place the blame on the LCB and the
legislature, Auditor General
Benedict points ‘out that the ad-
ministration has encumbered $555
million for the alleged purpose of
paying forthcoming bills. It has
been our experience over the last

several years that approximately ten .

percent of these encumbered funds

bills, but are lapsed and the money

appropriation. In the current fiscal

Unfortunately, there are not

higher education and I would gladly
vote for increased taxes to provide
this money.

  State Representative Appalled at Governor's Action

3

To the Editor:

As you are aware, there are two
seperate budgetary issues facing
state-related universities. One, uni-
que to this fiscal year is the looming
threat of ‘a 10 percent cut in funding
based upon the the state’s inability

_ -to generate revenue sufficient to

‘L

meet scheduled expenditures. Pitt,
Penn State, and the other non-
preferred appropriations are
vulnerable to these cuts because of

their budgetary status, much as they j

were held hostage in the chaotic
budget and tax battles of 1977.
Resolution of this issue hinges on
the fate of legislativeefforts slated
for the fall and the outcome of a
lawsuit which has been filed that
may alter the ‘relationship between
preferred and non-preferred ap-

. propriations.

The more complex problem is the
annual controversy over the level of
state funding. In simple terms, the
increase in state funding rarely, if
ever, matches the inflation rate as
applied to education costs. State-
related universities, state colleges,
community colleges, and the public
school system all encounter the
same fate. Current state budgetary
philosophy calls for increases in
spending less than the rate of inﬂa-
tion. This policy serves as a nominal
brake on government induced inﬂa-
tion and forces money managersto
become more efficient and
eliminate frills.

In many cases, this philosophy
also translates into an increase in
the local share of costs. ‘For institiu-
tions of higherlearning, _it means
either stepped up efforts to obtain

\ .

private funding, tuition increases,
cutbacks in program offerings, or
often some combination of the
three. ,

As long as inﬂation continues to
ravage the economy, tuition in-
creaseswill be a fact of life at col-
leges and universities throughout
the nation. However, the size and
effect of these‘ increases can be
ameliorated. As tuitions rise, the
amount of state and federal aid to
students has increased commen-
surately and eligibility has been
broadened. Part-time employment
opportunities for students have
become more numerous in response
to soaring educational costs.

As stated earlier, economies have
been introduced and cutbacks in-
curred. In the short-term, retrench-
ment is probably benficial, but it

cannot be a long-term process.
Unabated cutbacks arguably
diminish the quality of the product,
seriously imparing academic ser-
vices.

Barring a change in constitu-
tional status, which is a long-term
and somewhat dubious proposition,
the state-related universities and
their students face an uphill lobby-
ing effort. Given their “end of the
line” position on the funding spec-
trum, the state-relateds need inten-
sive lobbying from officials and
students to protect their share. In
addition, there is a greater need
here than elsewhere to demonstrate
the dollars spent are allocated wise-
ly as. there is no state oversight.

As an alumnus of Penn State, I
am sensitive to the needs of our
state-related,universities. As a state

Senator, I am all too familiar with
the annual funding crunch. I have
and will continue to be a staunch

advocate of sufficient level of fun-
ding to maintain the standards of

excellence we have established for "

higher education in the Com-
monwealth. The task before you is
to ensure that a majority of the
Senators and House members share
in this commitment.

By MIKE DICHIARA
_ Pitt News Ass't Sports Editor

The optimism expressed before
the Boston College game was toned
down at yesterday’s press luncheon
at the Crossgates Inn. There was
more of a feeling of how Pitt was
going to substantiate its preseason
high ranking.

When -the Panthers venture to
Lawrence, Kansas this Saturday to
face the Jayhawks, Pitt will try to
eliminate some of the mistakes
which plagued them throughout
their season opening win.

“Little mistakes hurt us a whole
lot,’’ said Panther coach Jackie
Sherrill, “but they are correctable-
The adversity should help us down
the_ line.”

Kansas coach Don Fambrough
spoke to the media via a telephone
hookup from Lawrence. He
evaluated both his team and Pitt. .

"‘I was pleased "with our
defense,” he said. They played bet-
ter than I expected. The defensive
turned V in a
performance.”

Indeed, the defense of Kansas
played well in‘ gaining a 7-7 tie last
Saturday against an experienced of-
fensive unit ‘in Oregon. Kansas’
starting quarterback was injured
early in the game so the Jayhawks
had to rely on‘ freshman, Frank
Seurer, who finished the game.He
was so impressive that he has earn-
ed a starting berth against Pitt.

“We’ll (Kansas) start the
freshman(Seurer),” said Fam-

' brough. “He’s similar to Marino in

that he possesses a lot of maturity
'foi' a freshman.” '

Kansas may have an immediate
advantage in the punting game.
Against Oregon, the Jayhawks
averaged 46 yards per punt. Pitt on-

ly averaged 30 yards against Boston ’
_ College.
Fambrough was asked about

Pitt’s defense. “I am amazed by
that defensive unit.- Looking at the

films, I saw that they are all over the »

ﬁeld. It is one of the best defensive
units I’ve seen ever.”

Pitt defensive coach Ron Dicker-
son commented on the performance
of that unit. “Watching the secon-
dary during the game from the
sidelines, I was disappointed,” he
said. “But after looking at the films
afterward, overall they did a good
job.”

Terry White had two intercep-
tions and played very well,” said
Dickerson. “Trocano did a super

Dave   Trout Kicked Around

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Sports Writer -

Some oftthe most famous stars
and top-notched athletes have been
discovered in the most ironic ways.
Looking -around, one can see that
there are still thousands of young
talented athletes just waiting 3 for
their prime opportunity to make the
headlines.

In fact take a walk up to Pitt
Stadium any dayand on can see a

_ discovery that‘, in the past three

years has turned out to be a very im-
portant one for the_Panther foo’-
ball team. That discovery is Dave
Trout. '

Trout, who spent his growing
years in Bolivia, didn’t really know
too much about playing the
American game of football.’ To
him, a football was much rounder
and had black and white leather

‘ panels, and was not made of

pigskin. Until one afternoon when
Trout, then a sophomore at nearby
Southmoreland High School, was
kicking around a soccer ball, and
was stopped by his high school

football coach. That man was John

Bacha who Trout gives a great deal
of credit to for his career.
“Yeah, I was doing a little bit of

. .. !<i.c.l<.ir.1s. with. the . s.°c.c.er P41! and .

Georgetown threat.

coach Bacha asked me if I wanted
to play football. I decided to give it
a try.”

Thanks to Bacha’s persistent
coaching, Trout is now a prominent
member of the high ranked Pan-
thers and aiming to break the Pitt
record for a field goal of 52 yards.

‘*1 credit a lot to Coach Bacha for
starting me out,” said Trout. “He

Pantherette Spikers Host Invitational

By SCOTT STONE

This weekend’s. Pitt Invitational
Women’s Volleyball Tournament
promises to be a premier showcase
of Eastern power and talent. The
Pantherettes will meet, head on, the
five toughest teams in their divi-
sion.

“We’re a young team, but we’re
strong,” said coach Shelton Collier.
“I set this match up to put the cards
on the table.”

Pitt opens against second-ranked
Georgetown at 4:30 p.m. on Friday.
According to the coach, the D.C.
team is strong, experienced, and
filled with six-footers. Collier is
relying on his squad to play ‘-‘in-
telligent volleyball” to counter the

was in a position where he either
made me or broke me. He went out
of his way to help me because I had
never kicked before. He always
made an effort to make me comfor-
table.” '
Trout never really lived in the
states until his senior year of high
school. He and his parents, who
were missionaries in Bolivia travel-

“Our team is short, but we have
power,” Collier said. “These girls
have been playing long enough that
they’re confident and accustomed
to using theirsmarts to defeat teams

that are bigger and stronger than
them.” _

The concept of “intelligent
volleyball” is rooted in a strong
player sense of the game, and is
constantly refined through practice
and preparation. After last week’s
tournament in Cleveland, the team
is concentrating on serving, setting,
and spike-shot selection.

“Our serves were good in
Cleveland,” Collier said, “but they
need to be better’ against these
Eastern teams.”

Setter Maria Perez will be getting
a lot of practice this week, accor-

evideced by the game against
Oregon. Kansas gained a tie with 15
seconds remaining in the game, cap-
ping a 65-yard touchdown drive.

When asked what concerns him

.most about Pitt, the Kansas coach

replied, “Everything.”

Pitt Notes: This will be the first
ever trip to Lawrence for the Pan-

ed to the United States a number of
times due to medical reasons. For-
tunately, for the young Trout’s
career, those trips seemed to occur
in the fall of the year---better
known in Pittsburgh as FOOT-
BALL SEASON.

So after graduating from
Southmoreland (Trout lived there
his entire senior year) and com-

ding to the coach. “Practicing not
only good passing, but retrieving in-
accurate passes,” he said “She’s
going to set a couple hundred balls
each day.”

Spike-shot selection is a key to
the team’s power. Spikers Ellen
Mangus, Shelly Riemersma, Diane
Zak, and Paula Olsen will be prac-
ticing against male players to
develop skills necessary to beat the
tall Georgetown players.

“We’re working with them
specifically,” Collier said, “on im-
proving their ability to hit around
blocks, and to hit quick offensive
plays.” ,

This tournament will have a
great deal of bearing on the Na-
tionals, with 20. teams competing.

Soccer Ball First

pleting a very successful high school
career, it was time to choose which
college to attend. The nearby Pan-
thers had just won the national
championship and still had a
number of returning players to
makeup another fine team under
new head coach Jackie Sherrill.

“Objective opinions” in the East
are looking to Georgetown and
Rutgers as the teams to beat, citing
their strength, and Pitt’s loss of six
foot seniors Andy Plent and Cindy
Chambers.

“People are expecting Rutgers
and Georgetown to defeat us this
season,” Collier said, “but our
team’s pretty sure that’s not going
to happen.”

The Pantherettes expect to gain
valuable information and efl"
perience against these teams that
will help them later in the season.

“If we lose to some of these
Eastern teams,” said Collier, “we’ll
be able to quickly identify what it is
we need to work on.”

  Boorers Ready for Invaders Fromsr. Vincent's  

By ANNA ARLOITA
Pitt News Sports Writer

Three years have passed since the
Pitt soccer team has met St. Vincent
College, this evening’s opponent at
Pitt Stadium. In that last confron-
tation between the two squads, the
Panthers came out on top of the
scoring with an 8-0 anihilation of
St. Vincent.

That was three years ago though
and the makeup of both squads
have changed quite considerably.
‘First of all, on the Panthers’ end of
the ﬁeld were two players that have
now played two years ‘of profes-
sional ball. Frank Bucci, an
outstanding performer in front of
the Pitt nets and Johnny O’Hara, a
superb midfielder, led the way to
the Panther victory. -Another dif-
ference was very evident on the
other side of the field with the St.
Vincent squad. St. Vincent was a
much smaller inexperienced, young
team that simply did not fare well
against a much more
knowledgeable Panther lineup.

The confrontation will again take
place. The Panthers will show a
very young team when they take the
ﬁeld. this evening, a team that
despite the fact that there are only
two seniors on the squad, still had a
great deal of experience under their
belts.

Danny Hamm and Tom Kunkel
are the only two seniors under head
coach Leo Bemis’ instruction this
season. It is Bemis’, hopes, after
ing St. Vincent play last weekend,
that the Panthers don't consider
them too lightly, based on past ex-
perience. '

“I saw St. Vincent and ‘Mercy-
hurst (another Pitt opponent later

-jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

I in this season) tie each other 1-1 in

an overtime game last
weekend,”said Bemis. “They have
avery good team this year, unlike
when we last met them three years
ago. The goalkeeper is very active,

‘with good hands, punting, ‘ and

throwing. Plus everyone on the
team goes to the ball in the air,”
continued Bemis,“and the passing
is good also.” :

St. Vincent will be the -first con-
ference foe that the Panthers will
face in the young season. With St.
Vincent being a Division II school,
though, Pitt’s first Divisionpl com-
petition will not come until the Slip:
pery_._Rock matchup this Saturday
on. the road. Pitt’s overall record
stands at 1-1, after the Panthers
defeated Kent State last Friday
night in a 2-0 overtime game.
Sophomores Eric Tiedtke and Troy
Norton scored in the 20 minute
overtime period. “We won't know

. exactly what we've got here until we

get some more games under our
belts," said Bemis. “Kent State did
not pose as too tough of competi-
tion like Akron did the week
before. We did show improvement
between those two games; the
younger players that I am insertin_g/
are working in good and there is a
fine team effort.”

Back again to defend the Panther
nets will be junior Scott Thunberg
who has been displaying some very
impressive keeping techniques in
the past few weeks. Thunberg had
boosted himself into the number-
one goalie position after sharing the
job for the past two seasons.

WE CONSIDER

(Continued from page 12)

Trout chose the Panthers over such

major colleges as Tennessee,‘

‘Florida, Penn‘ State, Michigan, "and
West Virginia.

.“Pitt was close to my new home
plus the team had just come off a
very impressive national cham-

, pionship year,” said Trout. “It was

an exceptional program to go into

and the team was receiving good.

recognition from all the media.”
Another thing to consider was the
man recruiting -him. “I had been
recruited by a lot of schools, one of
which was University of Tennessee

and Johnny Majors,” said Trout.’

“Sherrill was much more ‘convinc-

_ing.” .

It is that same Johnny Majors
and the same University of Ten~
nessee that Trout and his‘ team-
-mates will face on- October 25 in
Knoxville. The Volunteers are one
of the teams that make what Trout

~ considers to be a tough schedule for

the Panthers. . _

“All our opponents will be tough.

and even more so because we are
ranked highly and predicted to do
well this season, said Trout. So

everyone that we meet will be trying

to be the team that will knock us
off. Teams like Penn State and
WVU are always tough to go up
against, just as is Syracuse and a
number of others.

This high ranking and impressive
predictions have been going on ever
since the end of last season when
the Panthers “finished the 1979
season ranked number six in the na-
tion. Trout believes that it does add
pressure on him andhis teammates,
but} he also thinks that the Panthers
are handling the publicity very.well.

“It does add. undue pressure
every week to the team,” said
Trout, “but there are alot of seniors
on "the team and a. great deal of
maturity. I_ think that everyone is
taking the credit and criticsm very
well. We have a fine team here this

year with. an excellent display of .

spirit. We’ve worked hard and we
have a good mental attitude which

I is something that we have 'toAmain_- .
, tain all year.”   
When Trout came to the Pan‘-: 

thers as’ a freshman in 1977, .-‘he?
.didn’t just walk into the number“ _,

 

one kicking position on the team‘... ‘

Competition was there in the7forr’n 

of Marc Schubert. He shared those"-_’ 

kicking responsibilities -» with."

I Schubert for three years, along  . ‘
the punting job. This year is the -V .‘

first that the job has been Trouts’. 

alone. With all these opportunities - _-

in line for the rest of the season, 
Trout should have a good chancetof
break Pitt’s longest ﬁeld goal ’

record of 52 yards, which was tied‘ 

back in 1974 by Carson Long. Fred
Cox also holds the same record.

“This is the first time that ‘all the j 

kicking has been in my hands,”

said Trout,“and I ‘certain_ly'don’t 

want to be a weak spot on the team

that is going to be great. People are _i_

expecting a lot from us this yearandlj 
we haven’t proven anything yet.
That’s something that we have to
do every week.”

Breaking that field goal record is . i

one of the top thingsxon Trout’.s list
of personsal accomplishments for
this 1980 season. °

‘‘I had a 51-yarder against "WVU
in 1978 but I am aiming to break.
that record,” said Trout. “But my
biggest goal is to have a consistent
season.” '

Trout goes back to the days when
he didn’t know much about playing

. \

I

football, known as soccer, to which .’

Trout credits his career.

Soccer has done everything -for I‘

my football career. It has_ given .
said Trout. “I love the sport. so "
much because it gave me the-oppor-
tunity to receive a football scholar-
ship at Pitt and receive an educa‘,-,
tion. If I don’t make it in football _~
afmr college I'll go back to soccer.”

 Step People... Moving Up In  World    

 any nun: BALLARO’l'l'0

'C_“These stepsrepresent us—they
aren't going anywhere. Neither are
any of us.” '

“Because it's here.”

, “Because the steps don't ‘go
anywhere. I mean, we wouldn't sit
on steps that people use all day.
Besides, it's right in the center of
things; most of our classes are
near.” .

These are some of the answers I
got when I asked the “step people”
why they sit on the “steps to
nowhere.”

The steps to nowhere, located in
the Student Union, are a gathering
place for commuter students. Most
of them are from Plum and Steel
Valley. -The step people aren't a
new thing here at Pitt. The original
step people, who were from Steel
Valley, set up the tradition six or
seven years ago. ’

iriendzz environment. Please contact

This year’s group includes cham-
pion class cutters Matt Smith, Terry
Churilla, and Jerry Gaughan, who

is also famousfor sleeping on the

steps. Then there's Bob Wilson

A ' (“Dumpster”), who is known as the

“resident psychopath.” -

“He'll kill for a dime,” said
Gaughan.

Abuse is common on the steps to
nowhere, as Bob Curry, the “resi-
dent person to beat on”.would con-
firm;

The rest of the members are Les
Weyant ‘ (who wants to know if
Warmkessel “put me up to this”),
Janelle Barthlow, Beth Osterholm,
Andi Vitulla, Ellyn Cup, Lenny
Szarmach, Drew Borcik, Lisa Shar-
rett, Janet Frazier, Mark Merritt,
and Glen Kopec. _

When I asked them what they do
between classes, I got a variety of
answers, but they all agreed it
wasn’t studying.

 

“What happens here is entertain-

.ing if you have a sense of humor,”

said one.
‘-‘lt’s great to watch people,
especially freshmen. We see people

.start up these steps, thinking they
a go somewhere. They are so embar-
. rassed when they realize that the

steps just go around and back
down. ‘They sit down for a few
minutes and pretend they belong
there,” a step person said.

“We have been known to play

‘ baseball on the steps,” another ad-

ded. '
When they are not in class and

they are not busy making fun of »

freshmen, the step people amuse
themselves by abusing each other,
sponsoring toga parties, and parti-
cipating in sports. Their favorite
sport is “gatering,” but they also
like the more common sports, such
as football and soccer. They have a
'ootball and a soccer team, which is
;nown as the Steps. The Steps plan
to do well this season; they are pret-
ty sure that they will go undefeated
into the National Championship.
The step people are always look-
ing for new members. Right now
they are looking for one with an
apartment--could that mean the end
of the step people? If anyone is in-
terested in joining the step people,
they have to pass the tests. I’m not
sure what the tests are, but I know
that they involve some kind of

abuse. The step‘ people are also
looking for female recruits;
however, they must be able to take
abuse. ‘ ’

.“Most‘of the guys here talk like
drunken sailors,”, according to a
step person.

There is .a similarity between the
step people and “Animal House,”
and the step people would like
veryone to know that “Animal
House” is a copy of them.

"John Belushi was down here a
couple of times, and we taught him
how to “gater,” the step people
confided.

Anyone who _is interested in join-
ing the step people, or would just
like to see them (Is this really true?),
can stop in at the Student Union
between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. If
you’re tired of going to classes, feel
you need some abuse, or just feel
like killing time, drop in for a visit.
The step people welcome everyone.

Burt Reynolds seems tofall undeniably

‘ a hindrance to his career is uncertain, for

Reynold’s has stepped out of the 'good ole’

‘Concert’, Experience

No Nukes ~ V _ _

Directed by Julian Schlossberg

Danny Goldberg and Anthony Potenza \ .
By MARY 

 At the beginning of the movie No Nukes,
a fan waiting outside New York's Madison
Square Garden‘ comments that "...the
crowd is a bunch of bullshitters. They're
just here for a concert." The same could be
said for the crowd at a local theater, where
shouts of "Bruce!" seemed to be the norm,
while any demonstrative anti-nuclear_feel-
ing was non~existent. A

‘ The music, after all," is _the core of the
film. Footage from MUSE (Musicians
United for _Safe Energy) concerts hghlights
No Nukes.
anti-nuclear statements, a MUSE film, and
backstage glimpses of the musicians.

The; musicians involved in the project,
from Jackson Browne to Graham Nash,
turn in outstanding musical performances.
Particularly exceptional is a James Taylor-

Carly Simon-John Hall-Graham Nasl_1_ren- ’ "

dition of Dylan's ”The Times They Are A
Changin’.” Anti-nuclear anthems, like

Browne's "Before the Deluge," Hall's?
”Power,_” and Nash's new "Barrel of Pain”'

work’ well and mix easily with the variety of
music offered by the other performers.
The Pittsburgh audience was somewhat
unappreciative of this, however, for at
every change of scene, the familiar shouts
of "Bruce" would begin. Springsteen lives

up to all expectations, offering. easily the

' most energetic performance of the night.

The music blends well with .

Bruce follows a new song, ”The.River'.' with 9”

the classic "Thunder Road,” then plays with

the audience, dramatically fainting then ,1

coaxing them to beg for more.
Interspersed with the performances are

glances backstage’. Some of these moments

aregspontaneous and touching; sornexseem
staged and hard to take. Graham Nash
rehear'ses”Our House" on the piano to the
inharmonious banging of his young son,
and the. two break into laughter. Converse-
ly, Nash states he's going to talk to Ralph
Nader, and while Ralph spews astonishing
facts about nuclear power, Nash says things
like "sheesh" .and_ “wow,” lookingpredict-‘
ably horrified the whole time.

In addition to this backstage footage, a A
film put together by MUSE is part of No -

Nukes. Consisting partly of actual U.S. .ar-
my films, the MUSE film is both shocking
and funny. An army chaplain, in glescrib- .
ing an atomic explosion, tells a soldier the
sky turns a beautiful pale yellow, and that
the explosion is a ”beautiful experience." ‘

  

Although the anti-_nuclear talk in No  . it

Nikes is effective, it doesn't overwhelm the

film. In fact, it's interesting to see rock stars  -

in another context: as concerned citizens,
as responsible parents.

 Scoring With Alternative Theater Exp

By CANDICE KOMAR

As I make my way up the dusty
red staircase, I can hear a muffled
voice from the floor above.‘ A stout
blonde-haired woman leans over the
railing and gives me a casual smile
of welcome. This was Pat Buckley,
whom I had asked to set uplthe in-
terview with Jed Harris, the new ar-
tistic director of Theater Express.
Looking past her, I see a 'man with
a beard and wild curly brown hair '
talking on the phone. ”Jed had to
get this call out of the way,” she ex-
plains. Jed looks up giving me a big
grin and a wave as if he has known
me for a long time. I had, in fact,
come in contact with this man
before when he spoke to atheater
class of mine last term, but we were
never personally introduced.

While we wait for Jed, I am
shown around the theater. The old
converted warehouse has the same .
special feel that any theater has
while it lies dormant without a

M rehearsal or a performance going
' on. The varnished seats shimmer
with eerie expectancy, and the flats’
echo theiremaining traces of energy
from a past rehearsal. Ihear the
phone being put back on its cradle, ‘
" and Jed comes around the canvas
that separates the theater from his
office with his quick easy walk. His
eyes shine a cool. pleasant blue. A
V Iintroduce myself and he takes
me to his '’office,’’ a“ desk among
several others located on the_ same
level as the stage. He climbs into a
high—backed black leather chair un-
doubtedly a former prop because of
-its elaborate design in contrast to
the other sterile furniture. Jed sits
with one leg crossed over the other.
After questioning him about his first
exposure to the theater and his for-

the theater. I act occasionally to
keep in touch with my work.”

Jed's mother was a ballet teacher '
so at an early age he was accus-
tomed to performing in small shows
and puttingon little productions of
his own in his backyard. In high

' _ school, after seeing a class perfor-

mance,’ he decided to try acting
himself and was chosen to play the
leads in many subsequent shows.
From there he went on to study
theater at the University of Wiscon-
sin because the professors there

were interested in the same type of

theater that he was. .Mr. Harris's
favorite type of theater‘ is not the
typical "la dee da” Broadway show,
but more challenging alternative-
forms of theater. Jed came to Pitts-
burgh straight-from Milwaukee five
years ago. "I'm here because at

that no longer possible, I'll either
find a different way to do it here or
go elsewhere." ’ ’
Jed lives on Negley Avenue,
about a mile away from thetheater.
- He shares an apartment with his '

girlfriend Pamela and her cat. A
typical day for him is waking up at .
nine thirty, getting out -of bed at
ten, then going to the office. When
working with a full time company
such as Theater Express,he usually
rehearses during the late afternoon
and early evening. His favorite time
to work, according to ‘his own
biological clock, is from ten"p.m. to

I two a.m. orlater. It usually takes
him about two hours to wind down
from rehearsal, and Jed usually does
this by either reading (three .
newspapers daily) or watching
television. He admits to being ad-

_ dicted to M.A.S.H. and Lou Grant.
”There is something 'there~that ‘an
awful lot of people want to see. _I
enjoy watching it for that sake. A
lot of times when I watch TV I just

’ “sit and turn into\a zombie for a J
couple of hours—not really seeing
what is on the screen, but letting
certainlthings from rehearsal run ,

' The whole time.he is talking, Jed"

.‘ projects an eagerness to share his
love for his work. Cigarette smoke
streams up through thexsunlight
which is pouring in the bare win-
dow, creating a thin haze. He is
almost lay_ing across his desk now,
one arm propped behind his mouse-
colored head. J

The phone rings. Pat,, who is

working at a desk nearby, answers
it at _a glance from Jed. She says it
is Pittsburgh Magazine on the line.
Aware that the tape recorder is still
running Jed softly asks her to take a

It is rare when opera comes to Pitts-
burgh; it is even rarer when it com’esJ_ to a

theater group like the Pittsburgh"

Laboratory Theatrep And for the time it
takes to screen actors both for their voice
and histrionic techniques, to direct en-

‘trances with the music, and even to write

the score, it would seem that theefforts
would not be wasted. But alas, for the most
part, they are, at least as far as the casual
theatergoer is concerned.

Theater is entertainment; if it doesn't ab-
sorb* the audience's interest and embody its
collective intellect" during the course of the
evening, another choice is still_open: the
audience could leave with something to
think about. Unfortunately this production
really is not effective at either, for various

‘ reasons.

The opera is based on an

- autobiographical novel by Gertrude Stein,

written‘ in 1901, about her and the three
generatins before her. \Gertrude Stein, we
learn during the two-and-one-half hour
(too long) opera, is a writer. Nothing of
real interest (i.e., anything unique) is
re\\]Iealed about her philosophy of writing,
on y that she often describes her occupation

in cute terms. This is the beginning of the J

opera, and the audience almost immediate-
ly lets these first few minutes of Stein's
(Julie Silverman) monologue penetrate their
minds, but from there on, words—simple
words, standard writers’ ideas—slip by,
and we are waiting for something else to
happen. \

It does. From Stein's non-operatic
monologues (which begin the production
and are spaced quite liberally throughout),

Jed’s favorite plays are not tradi-
tional in the sense of what usually

_ comes to mind when we think of an

\ actual script. He prefers to have a

group of actors collaborating on

which direction to take at each

is Samuel Beckett. Last season he

work to-me, I tried to come as close
as possible to what I thought

play currently being done is unique
to the nature of each piece. Jed has

ly—on a miserable piano by Asher Raboy,
and conducted by Ian Gallacher. The cons-
tant simple tinkering on the piano lends
itself very soon to’tedium and becomes.
trancelike in its monotony, not aided by
that which’happens' onstage. Well, the
ancestors of Gertrude Stein appear, in black
and white garb, and sing—generally not
well and oftentimes terribly——about
themselves and their troubled souls. And
troubled they are, for they are migrating to
America, gradually losing their old world
traditions and replacing them with the

‘values’ and culture (and flippancy) of the

American way of life.

_Wha_t lacks here is a_ development of
characters, and there are many. We are
simply sung to, a musical lecture as it were,
and there—is absolutely little for the au-
dience to do intellectually in order to feel
out the characters themselves. As far as
what can be obtained from the play, Stein's
monologues, while hypnotic (they go from
the simple and occasionally cute to the

J flamboyantly repetitious), they do repre-

sent-an evolution of self-awareness.

~- Behind the door of room 117 in
the music building on the Pitt cam-
pus, there lies a vast realm of unex-
’\ \ plored territory. Each year a dozen
or so students walk in, barely
suspecting what they will be up
against. Regardless, though, by the
time they are finished with the
course, which started them on their
., "trek, they emerge as composers—of
electronic music. '

Begun decades ago as collections
of tape recorders, then growing to
include other electronic noise-
producing gadgets, and then finally
incorporating the development of
actual synthesizers, the world of
electronic music has been gaining in

_, popularity as well as complexity?’

But the Pitt music studio goes one
step further—the use of computers .
to control different aspects of
sound. And the synthesizer-
computer hybrid system is among

the few in the nation.
K .

. . This term, music professor
Wayne Slawson will be teaching the
first of an anticipated two-year se-

\ quence of courses, Introduction to
Electronic Music. Open to anyone,
regardless of musical background or

scrutiny. The collection of Navone’s

also be a bit of work with the com-_ ‘
puter, but don't worry-—no com-
puter experience is needed either.
Slawson sees the work performed in
the studio as ”producing sounds
from‘/scratch,” allowing the com-
poser, using various techniques, to** E

sounds are brought together in
aesthetically pleasing patterns.

teaches at the Washburn University of Art
in Topeka and received his bachelor's and
master's degree from San Jose State College
in California. Navone concentrated on
figurative painting for approximately ten
years before a non-figurative style evolved
that has since grown more abstract. '

’’I'd rather they look and bring their own
experiences into the painting. It's up to the

. student to complete them,” he said.

Navone does not title his works. ”There
isn't a literary content. Verbalization is
something forced on us. Words are «limited
and limiting,” he said. ~

He prepares his canvases with latex paint .
only on the wrong side, then uses a penciled
grid to transfer the design he has worked
out earlier on a smaller scale. The grid lines

provide a skeleton for each piece, a solid

foundation. Five large canvases, prepared
in this manner, are the focal point of the ex-
hibition that includes a smaller canvas
without a grid and several ink and crayon
drawings. Color -treatment varies from can-
vas to canvas. In one instance, pure
yellows, greens, and blues are ‘delicately
blended so that one almost suspects an air-
brush was used. On the same wall, deeper
browns and reds are given a rougher, more
emotional treatment.

The works’ deepest fascination, however, ,.

lies in the complex, convolusive designs he
carefully transferred to the canvas. The
designs are at once fragmentary and

unified, suggesting different moods and im- 3

ages. _

”One takes the chance of being an ass,"
Navone said. "If a work ceases to be mysti-
fying, we stop looking.”

. Slawson has taken notice of the
synthesizer’s effect onthe music of
today. He cites one of the reasons -., .
for this "new musicT’: the advantage
of electronic musicis that it is
essentially unlimited as to the varie-

to the control over them.

computer, sits like a control center,
connected to the music facility by a_
thick "umbilical cord” which carries
the voltages necessary to regulate
the synthesizer. A course in com-
puter music was taught for the first
time last winter, using computer

. programs developed by ‘Slawson
and other members of Pitt's music
faculty and staff.

For those interested in ta_king the
electronic music courses, there is a
lot of knowledge to be gained. But
working successfully with electronic
music calls for only two things, says
Slawson: imagination and a great
deal of time. It is a relatively dif-
ficult field of composition in‘ that
many find ithard to imagine dif-
ferent‘types of musical structures,
and to use these components in a
piece of music may require a large-
scale effort. ”But,” Slawson says,
"it’s a wonderful way to approach
the, creative process.” ‘

— - Even if you can't fit the course in-
to your schedule, you may still
become exposed to electronic music
at Pitt through one of two ways.
First, on the last Wednesday of

a half-hour tour of the facility will
take place starting at 8:30 p.m.

Starting Anew With Capote On ‘Music For Chameleons’  

MUSIC FOR CI-IAMELEONS
Truman Capote
Random House

. ' By KAREN METZINGER

Music for Chameleons is the work of a.

new writer, Truman Capote. In this book
of short stories and a short non-fiction

novel, "Handcarved Coffins," Capote ex- _

hibits a brand—new style that ”s_ets (himself)
center stage." The gambling is high stakes;
tampering with a highly successful style to

_ \ pcreatea new and hopefully, successful one.

Capote broke the bank on this one. Music
for Chameleons is more than an enjoyable

_ book for readers. It is also a textbook for
writers. _'

Many of the stories in this collection are a
result of the hundreds of writing exercises
that Capote set himself to. In the preface of
Music for Chameleons Capote writes, “(I)
reconstructed, in a ‘ vere, minimal man-

ner, commonplace conversations with

everyday people.. .. After writing hundreds

' of pages of this simple-minded sort ofthing,

I eventually developed a style. I had found

a framework into~which I could assimilate '

everything I knew about writing.”

The -book is divided into three parts."
Part I is headed, "Music for Chameleons."
The story of the same name is »a slightly
rhapsodic recounting of a visit with a
character, Madame, on Martinique. She is
a curious person, but what makes her more
intriguingis her relationship to the author,»

which is unexplained. This story isn't the

‘strongest of the set, but its title is in-

teresting, as well as the anecdote attached.
 Jones," "A Lamp in a Window," ”Mo-
jave," "Hospitality" and "Dazzle" complete
this first part. In these stories the reader
perceives a genuiness in Capote's style that
is sorely lacking in most contemporary
writers. Reading these stories is like sitting
back and listening with fascination as a
clever stranger reminisces ‘about the people
he has known, because that is exactly what
these stories are. ~ J

Part II is Handczzrued Coffins,subtitled
"A Nonfiction Account of an American
Crime." The story is told in "a play-like
form, mixing both objective and subjective
reportage of events and characters. The
plot is so clever one doubts its dub of "non-
fiction,” but, then, one never knows....
Handcarved Coffins, despite -its brevity,
could_ stand alone as a book, instead of be-
ing included in a collection.

Part III is titled "Conversational Por-

traits." The conversations.related in the
stories hereare with a variety _of people:
Capote's cleaning woman, an old college
acquaintance, a childhood friend, Pearl
Bailey, Robert Beausoleil (of Manson Fami-

ly notoriety), Marilyn Monroe, and with‘

himself. The treatment of these Jzeal per,-
sons/ characters is gentler than F. Scott Fit-
zgerald's (though he usually disguised
names), but Capote's use of these subjects
as bona fide material uses the same defense
as Fitzgerald did when he came under at-

tack for doing so. In Capote's-words, "All a.
writer has to work ‘with is the material he

has gathered as the‘ result of his own"

endeavor and observations, and he cannot
be denied the right‘ to use it. Condemn, but
not deny.” Despite the celebrity of sore of
these characters, the "conversations"

and the reader feels privy to a few delicious

We get a call from The Silencers’ per-

firmed. T '

Unfortunately, in the interests of

confrontation with the group did not pro-

life. , Not something you would expect
from guys who wear'.dark glasses in L
sweaty, smoky bars and play loud surging
music into-the wee hours of the morning.
Quickly, it becomes apparent that The
Silencers aren't your typical ”rock stars,"
if’ the cliche is appropriate. TThey aren't
kids anymore but men in their late 20's

who have lived through enough lean times.

to know what it takes to survive in
today's music biz. They are veterans of .
the Pittsburgh bar,scene'"and the

_ megalopoly business of rock 'n’ roll. In- ‘

deed, the credentials of this band are im-
pressive. 

They aren't show offseither, but musi-
cians who are happy «to beplaying the
type of music. they've always wanted to

do." That's not to say The Silencers aren't -

hungry-—they’re eager» to make this thing _a
success--just professional.

We explain to the band that we enjoyed

our initial meeting at Mancinifs but we
didn't get the real story that our impatient
editor had demanded.‘ A

The Silencers become very cooperative.
We have gained their trust.

”Do you wanna know the true untold
story," King asks, "or the glim-glam '
story?” . -

"Whatever," we respond. _ .

‘ __'/They_’r'e both one in' the same," assures

Czuri. _ 7

The Silencers" story to date is this so
far: S \

King: "Me and D.T. (Takos) were
playing in a lounge band and we said,
‘fuck this shit, and let's try this’ and then
we got these other guys together." -

_paign was to make a demo tape of King

and Takos-penned songs. The band
entered" Ierée studios in New Brighton last
November and cameaway with "Shiver
and Shake,” "Head On Collision," "I
Can't Believe It” and the as-o_f-yet

4 ‘unreleased "Love Gone Bad" in the can.

They then signed a management deal with
Record Logic, a company that also
handles David Werner. All of this was
finalized before The Silencers ever ap-
peared on ._a_ stage. V

With’ a management deal and a record-
ing advance in hand, The Silencers began
to hone their sound and image on the few
Pittsburgh clubs thatwould take them.
‘ 1 ’’When we startediplaying‘ around the
city, no one wanted us," explained Foster
of thier difficulty in securing gigs and exile
to smaller clubs like the Electric Banana.

. Now, of course, The Silencers are in de-

mand at home and abroad.

The next step was the all important
,record debut to be done in the Power Sta-
tion studios in New York with producer
Bob Clearmountain, another Werner
association. Clearmountain’s recording
credits include Bruce Springsteen's forth-
coming album, The River; '

Rock 'n’ Roll Enforcers took a mere -
seven days invDecember to complete, \
"hand claps and all.” The finalstep was
to find at record company willing to take a
chance on a new band. Chrysalis and
A&M Records showed interest but

E ultimately, The Silencers found it most‘

convenient to do it themselves.

”Our manager shopped around for the
best deal and the best possible deal was to
create a new label for the band," Pella ex-’
plained. Thus Precision Records was

launched. Hopefully, the label will lend
some much needed support for other ‘
Pittsburgh bands soon. ‘ l
‘A After the album hit the streets, The
Silencers hit the road. Cleveland, Detroit,
Ph_iladelphia (with Hall 8: Oates), Cincin-
nati (with Heart and 10, 070 -fans) and
.New York (Trax, The Ritz) were all whis-
tle stops along the _way. The Silencer
_ message was beginning to spread.
‘I _TheS'ilencer/ secret agent image was
‘developed by King-who claims the in-
spiration was culled from old 007 movies.
In "You know how cool James Bond is,”
said King tongue-in-cheek, "well that's
how cool we are. James Bond is so suave

record) and the Atlantic Records signed

Czuri remembers his three albums and
four years with Diamond Reo with a twist
of frustration and pride of having sur-~
viyed a trying but learning experience.

"With Diamond Reo we gave vita real
good shot. ~Probably alittle longer than it

' should have been," he_said_'of'his days I

when the'.Dia,monds supported rock acts .
like Ted Nugent, Kiss, Blue Oyster Cult, .

every record they pressed. Interestingly
enough, Diamond Reo. albums are now

tinental: Plus all those gimmicks he has,
too." . . '  '
C But King also admits that the intema-
tionalspy look didn't go over with
"everyone. He concedes the band may’
play down the image in the future.

Warren King is probably Pittsburgh's

most recognized guitarist——certainly the
coolest. The tag as "the Gary Cooper of
rock guitarists" suits him well. His com-
ments are short and straight to the point
yet he's equally open and great to talk to.

L It's clear, however, that The Silencers
are his brain trust. ‘ .

King hails from the Wilkinsburg area"

Another One
Bites The Dust

QUEEN/ DAKOTA
Civic Arena

_ \ By MARK MONAHAN

On Queen's last visit to Pittsburgh three
years ago, ﬁfe British quartet played during
a blustery winter night at a lesslthan half-
filled Stanley Theater.

At thetime, the band was little more than
a cult group, and the size of the audience
wasn't surprising.

' Since then, the band's fortunes have
definitely improved with a continuous
string of gold and platinum albums and hit

‘Q singles and you would think that when they

recently played the Civic Arena,‘ a ticket for
the show would besa hot item.
That was not ‘the case. The band drew

in less than 7,000 people and it seemed as if

somebody had forgot to tell Pittsburgh that
the group with the number five album in
the country was in town.

Those who did show up were treated
to an unbelievable -light show from a group
who needs all the dynamic help and flash
they can get to try and give theinextremely
lightweight and sugary hard rock pop any
degree of urgency and excitement.

To put it-bluntly, Queen live is a rather
limp and wimpy bands

Lead singer Freddie Mercury is perhaps
the most obnoxious posing frontman in the
history of rock’n’roll. Instead of entertain-
ing _or creating something of hisown, Mer-
cury takes styles and songs'and tries to get
away with his rather practiced macho but
uninspired delivery. »

Be it Elvis Presley‘ rockabilly ("Jailhouse I

Rock," "Crazy Little Thing Called Love"),

 opera ("Bohemian Rhapsody”), punk rock

("Sheer Heart
Attack"), heavy
metal (”Tie Your

cury was doing so

knock him out or at

better. Drummer

The anticipation of a weeks-in-advance
sellout at Mancini’s and the frustration of a

brief city Fire Marshall interupted ap-.

* pearance at The Decade back in March, had

only whetted the appetite. This time The I

Pretenders did not disappoint.

As a still growing group, The Pretenders
are immense_ly blessed. Chrissie Hynde,
clearly the leader of the band, does quite
well for an ex-groupie. Her song writing is
dynamically strong, her voice is transcen-
dent and her guita? playing is more than
adequate. Her petulant demeanor,
however, seems unlikely to change.

The Mancini show began with Chrissie

and company a little cold and indifferent .
’ towardslthe SRO crowd—they were a‘-tad
methodical in their delivery. and I-Iynde was - '

acting so damn-hard-assed, she froze the
audience in fear instead of pulling them into

V the swing of things.-

t Civic Arena

easy and simple cymbal crashes and
elementary rolls to compensate for his
rather lackluster style.

The only saving grace of the band was
lead guitarist Brian May. He has a unique
guitar sound from his homemade axe, and
it was the songs on which he was primarily

featured—"Brighton Rock," ”Now I'm
Here,” ”Tie Your Mother Down”—that was
Queen at it's best. A

Of course, May is only one fourth of

‘ Queen and it is Mercury who dominates the ‘
' group's image and sound with his posing

and songs.
To strip them of their light show, smoke
and stage theatrics and let Queen stand on
‘its music alone would expose how really
uncreativeﬂand unimaginative their .music
is. Not the kind of stuff that has the
substance to last through the years, nor

f should it.

As for Dakota, Queen's opening act, they
are the latest in the long line of Journey,
Foreigner and Styx clones polluting the air-
waves and concert halls of America;

With really imaginative and stimulating
songs with titles like "Lady" and ’’Changes’’
thrown in their atrociously pedestrian
50-minute set, you wonder how these guys
ever got signed, let alone put out on na-
tional tour when there are ten bands in this
city who could blow their hippie mentalities
and music right off the stage.

like an attack on her) adoring fans. Later,
she dedicated "Up The Neck," ”to the
asshole that stole my handkerchief," and
scolded an Instamatic-happy fan with the
curt warning, ”no pictures, please!"

By the time\"I(id"*'folled around though,
The Pretenders loosened up and proved to
be quite the powerful’ force they are on
record. They whipped off most of their one
and only album and threw in the latest

single, ”Talk Of The Town," plus another '

Kinks cover from '65, "I Go To Sleep," that
didn't sound quite as catchy as "Stop Your

By GEORGE SI-IANER

Okay folks, here's the game plan. We've
got an album of local talent produced by
people in the city. At the same time, there's
a charity drive going on for the Will Rogers’
Institute. Wouldn't it be a good idea for the
acts on the album to get together and do a
show? That way the bands are able to pro-
mote themselves while helping out the
drive. Doing well, while doing good, eh?

It was a good idea except" for one small
flaw—no one showed up to watch the
show. Actually, that's a little harsh; it isn't

go on, though, and the‘ bands did acquit
themselves quite well. I - .

Empire, Rock N’ Ravens, and The
‘Flashcats are all basically cover bands doing
the music they admire‘. Respectively, it'_s
"heavy metal, Fifties’ rock 'n roll, and heavy
rhythm and; blues. These were the bands

incongruous in the King's Court and though
,_the playing was good, they couldn't trans-
' cend the artificialty of the situation.

, Hank and The Hornets and Eddie and
The Otters with some original material to
display managed to come off better under
the circumstances. With the more energetic
material delivered by these bands (different
stripes of Sixties’ Rock), the vacuum,was
partially filled. In particular, this was a

special occasion for the Otters as this was '

their last performance.

Somewhat ‘surprisingly, the most ap-

propriate sets were the acoustic country of.

The Leslie Smith Band and the nightcap of
The Walk N’ Roll’ Brothers. The light,

melancholy music of Leslie Smith fit the at- " '

mosphere of the‘ evening well. Also, the
camaraderie oflmembers of the various acts
, backing up The Walk N’ Roll Brothers put a

brave face on the evening as the whole crew _

went through a rendition of "Smokey Ioe’s
Cafe" (sung by Lee Hollihan, engineer‘ on

atlempted, there will be better luck in the

turn-out. All involved certainly -deserved . ~

By MARCY PETRUSCH _ '

After last August's concert cancelation, maybe Chicago felt they owed Pittsburgh
something. Maybe they were just glad to'be, back after a two year absence: For
whatever the reason, Chicago played to a sold-out audience, andwas superb.

The nine members of ‘the band (the group's seven plus two guests) didn't rely just on
"greatest hits"—although they were prominent and well placed— but played a lot of
new and lesser known material that the audience lcﬂed. A

The opening set was a mixture of pleasantly new songs that were combined with old
favorites to form not a new Chicago,'l_:zut a different Chicago. The emphasis was on
rock—not the easy listening ballads like "Colour My World" and "Wishing You Were
Here,," but more like ”Hot Streets” and the brand new Chicago XIV album.

Chicago opened with ”'I/"lre American Dream” from XIV. The crowd was on their feet I

cheering with in the _firstfew bars; it was a great start. » j E
Other songs in the first set included, "Beginnings," "No Tell Love," "Little Miss
Lovin-’,," "Alive Again," the new ”Manipulation,” and "Song For You.”
After the 50 minute intermission, Chicago came back to play some up-beat songs in-
cluding ”Doing Business,” "South California Purple," and the new ”Thunder and

Lightning,” "Overnight Cafe," and the excellent, ”Hold On." Then, it was back to their

greatest hits. Almost all the biggies were’ performed; "If You Leave -Me Now,” "Does’

Anyone Really Know What Time It Is?," "Saturday In The Park" and "Feeling Stronger
Every Day."_ ' } ’
' As” an encore Chicago came back with "25 Or 6 To 4" and the Beatles’ "Got To Get
You Into My Life." An appropriate finish. » '
Chicago was excellent. It was a concert worth waiting a year for.

CARY MYRICK AND THE’!-'IGURES

Nobody showed up.

Well, not actually noone. If you include
the bartenders, the band and its crew you
have half_ of the forty bodies in the

' Mancini’s audience last Tuesday night. This

relatively private public gathering was to
the Pittsburgh debut of Epic

and the Figures. The light turnout can be
explained by low profile, pre-concert
publicity and the simple fact that Pittsburgh
radio is giving Myrick andV‘Co. little to no
airplay action. All things considered this is
a shame, for Gary -Myrick and the Figures

V aren't too shabby live.

In concert Gary Myrick and the Figures
are much thewsame as they are on record.

V They are a cool, calculated, mainstream

new wave band. (They have much more in
common with the Cars than they do with

the Clash.) It quickly became apparent that '

the majority of these songs are commercial-
ly viable. "She Talks In Stereo," "The Par-
ty,"» and "She's So Teenage" contain plea-
sant hooks while still retaining the 1976
punk energy that allows this band to suc-
cessfully strattle the ‘fence between new
wave and Foreigner.

Considering the size of the crowd I didn't '
expect a good show but Myrick proved me

‘ wrong. As the Figures took the stage with a

new song called "Died on T.V.” they used
the opportunity to convert a few more peo-
ple into fans. Ten songs and 45 minutes
later Myrick was done, He exploited the
hooks in ”The Party," played-guitar hero
on "Ever Since the World Began" and
developed an amazing amount of dynamic
tension on ”She's So Teenage." They closed
with ”Meaningless" and it was over.

After the performance Gary Myrick. said
he was frustrated by the size of the crowd.

TED NUGENT/ HUMBLE PIE
Civic Arena
September 11, 1980

By. REX_NORDHEIMER

" In an eardrumlbursting performance at
the Civic Arena, Ted Nugent and Humble
Pie displayed their awesome talents. Crack-

ing the dome, Nugent bewildered his au- I
dience by using his guitar as an offensive‘

weapon. A

Beginning the evening's festivities, Hum-
ble Pie blasted a surprisingly small number
of songs. Singing ”Thirty Days in the
Hole," they prepared the populus for a
night of scorching—hot music. Even though
their set was extremely short-lasted, they

definitely left a good impression upon this )

critic.”

Anticipating the main attraction, the
mass of spectators created a riotous uproar
in the relatively short period of time in bet-

iﬁween the bands. Once ‘Terrible Ted" arriv-

ed with a variety of new and old songs, he
transformed his fans into a pack of crazed
lunatics. Not only did he play new songs
from his latest album, but he introduced

and recorded some unreleased material‘

such as "Jailbait," "Flying Lip—Lock," and
"Put-Up'or Shut-Up." Saving classics like
'"Cat Scratch Fever," and "Great White Buf-
falo," for the end, "The Wildman," turned
the volume all the way up for anight of in-
tense jam. etween encores, the dome was
opened concreting the magnificience of the
show. For his final return to the stage that

ff evening, Ted swung across the stage on a

rope, wearing nothing but a loin cloth.

After the conclusion, all left with more
than just a constant ringing in the ears, but
the memories of gnarly rock and roll.

DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES
Stanley Theatre
August 22,1980

3.. By scorr MOWRY

This evening started off a definite high
point when promoter Rich Engler announc-
ed that Black rose, featuring the infamous

‘ Cher had cancelled due to "a couple of sore

throats." Instead, Pittsburgh's .own The.

Silencers had, on very short notice, filled in
their absence.

Two junior reporters from The New Sun
also sitting in the freebie section, were
disappointed and asked, "who are they?‘
Ha, are you guys from Pittsburgh?"
~ The Silencers had to work hard to win
over a laidback Hall 8: Oates audience, plus
the few disappointed Cher fans. Consider-
ing the odds, they fared_ quite. well. By the
end of their 45 minute set there. was definite
Ewing in The_Silenc_ers' favor. Iln thiscase,‘

 

 

persistance (and a killer batch of songs)

paid off.  _
Daryl Hall and John Oates entrance onto
the Stanley stage was met by a barrage of
screams, bras and panties, not necessariuly
in that order, from a predominantly female

crowd.

The mood of the show was immediately
established as Hall 8: Oates and their four
piece band launched into "How Does It
Feel," fromthe new Voices album. For the
rest of the show, I couldn't help but feel
that the Philadelphia duo was playing for
the girls and ignoring all male patrons in the
audience.

Their 18 song set was-snappy but;if it
wasn't‘ for the Daryl Hall solo numbers,
“Sacred Songs” and'”New York, New
York," I would have definitely feltfslighted.

The inclusion’ of "You've Lost That
Lovin' Feeling" was a nice touch that ended
theshow. I just "hope that Hall 8: Oates

surpass their previous ‘achievements.

The Kinks concert repetoire was basically
a Low Budget tour (they played seven songs
from that: LP) with many greatest hits. Of
the Low Budget material, the blues based
"A Gallon of Gas" and the,pu‘mp-it-up
"Pressure" shined. In the greatest hits
department, satisfaction was guaranteed.
All you can say about classics like "All Day
And All the Night," "David Watts," "You
Really Got Me," "Lola," or "Celluloid
Heroes" is wonderful.

Ray Davies is one of the most animated
showmen I've "ever seen. He performed
with an energy and determination that puts
the punks to shame. Davies spent most of
the night literally jumping around the stage
on the balls of his feet, shaking hands with
the fans and whipping up piles of en-
thusiasm. oThe guitar work of Dave Davies

BENNY MARDONES

August 20, 1980 4 ‘
By DAVID KOVACH

The current recession continues to plague
the concert business withrising ticket prices.
and slumping sales. The Decade continues
to take strides in bringing nationally-
normally not have a place to play.‘ \_

The latest in this series of shows came off I
as scheduled when Benny Mardones and his
band took the stage on this hot August
night. A ‘standing-room-only crowd pro-
vided a warm welcome for this newcomer.

The set opened (like his latest album,’
Never Run Never Hide) with the
meticulously-crafted rocker ”She’s So’
French." "American Bandstand" is a tribute
of sorts’ to that dance show's‘host Dick
Clark. and how he, curiously enough, never
seems to age. Throughout the show, Mar-
dones mixed up the rockers and the ballads.
The highlight of the evening for most of
those in attendance was the faithful _rendi-
tion of Mardones’ hit song "Into the Night."
Of more importance to Mardones’ however
was "Too Young," a song dedicated to his
deceased cousin and good friend Johnny
I§,veret't. While covering eight of the nine
tunes from thenew album note-for-note,
Mardones headed into the crowd and urged
on audience participation during an extend-
ed version of the rousing "Mighta Been

Love." The band continued well‘ into the‘ '

wee hours of the morning with music from

the first LP. Thank God For Girls.
Mardones is a singer/songwriter with a

good stage presence, even though he plays

no instruments himself." The backup musi‘- \

cians were adequate at best as they careful-
ly and systematically turned out song after ’
song. Their inexperience in playing as a unit
was evident. Despite all of this, Mardones
stands out as an emerging talent for the
future. '

was unsurpassed. As an extra treat Dave

did the single of his solo album entitled "Im-
agination_."- Mick Avory is one of the
simplest,

whole thing together.

V j Imagine a mixture of David Johanson
and Bruce Springsteen and you have open-
ing act, ‘Johnny Cougar. His band, -The
Zone, contained the wildest stage antics by
a bass player in a supporting role. This ska
looking gentleman spent the evening runn-
ing from» stage . left to stage right and
generally upstaging Cougar. As a whole,
Johnny Cougar fend The Zone weren't bad,

' just undistinguished.

By far the'Kinks was the best concert in _.
Pittsburgh this year. ' In fact, it was the best’

show in the citysince last year's Who con-I
cert.

" PPANORAMA
The Cars
Elektra/Asylum.

The thing that placed Candy-O on
a lower plane of uniqueness from the
first Cars album was Ric Ocasek’s
new found penchant for writing_iam-
bic songs that rose from pentameter
to octameter. The basic difference
were the lyrics themselves and the
speed of the song.

Panorama seems to fall into the
same expectorating beat as Candy-O;
a spitting of metaphor and simile ac-
celerating to varying degrees, yet too
chug-chug for the Cars’ third effort to
stand on its own. .

Panorama picks up to a more tap-
pable speed by the end of thelfirst
side with ”Getting Through," and
carries it over to the entire second
side, but the album ends with the
listener still wanton of at least one or
two of the catches thatgave fire to
their debut work. Panorama is more

\ like a Candy-O sequel than a next in-
, stallment in the Cars repertoire, and
the enjoyment of the better songs like
"DownBoys," "Running To You,"
and "Up And Down” last only as

long as one listens to them. Nothing ~

really sticks to the ribs after you take
the album off. ‘

\The story continues.

In the recent glut.of California rock
‘<_’talent,” one of the few bands to real-
ly shine has been The Motels.
Something of a cross between The

Pretenders and Roxy Music, the jaun- _

diced worldview and smokey singing
of frontwoman Martha -Davis made
for an enjoyable experience’.

With the second album out, there's.

been a few- changes. The most
notable change has been the breaking
of.Davis’ song monopoly. This has
produced rockers like "Envy” and
"-Cry Baby;" aggressive numbers with

a "Bo Diddley beat from Tim »
.McGovern and Marty Iourad. Other I

standouts are "Party Professionals,"
a cynical piece of dance-rock from

more popular, Sabbath’s appeal took
a downfall. ,

AMERICAN NOISE

AMERICAN NOISE
American Noise
_ Elektra

‘ American Noise is a Cleveland,
Ohio hard rock band. Their debut
album sounds something like other
midwest hard rockers such as rniddle
period Rick Derringer, or Joe Walsh
during his days in the James Gang.
The record is listenable but you don't
go around «humming the songs once
it's offyour turntable. At this point,’
American Noise is unpretentious and
shows a little bit. of promise.

I'd give American Noise ten points
for their name and I'd remove five
points from their total score for
enlisting the help of L.A. trend-
monger Kim Fowley.

. PLAYING FOR KEEPS
Eddie Money
Columbia

Eddie Money is a rock star, but, by
no, means, "a superstar.. The main
reason for this has been that his first
two \ albums lacked punch—they

~were nice albums, mind you, but

nothing to get‘ very excited about.
Unfortunately, Playing For Keeps
falls into the same category.

Money seems to have what counts:
a gusty R8:-B voice, certified crowd

' appeal, and decent. songwriting skills.
Therefore, it seems safe to say that
he's not solely to blame. It's the pro-

. ducer's job to give an album direction
and to capture the best parts of an air-.
tist’s style‘ on vinyl. Ron Nevison
failed to do either one of these things,
which accounts for the album's
overall listless quality. ‘

As with the previous LP's, there
are no outstandingly bad songs here,
and even a few good ones. The best '
of the lot is the reggae-tinged ”Run-
ning Back," followed‘ "Trinidad,"
and ”Million Dollar Girl." Still, Play-
ing For Keeps is only for die-hard Ed-
die Money fans‘. .

WILD PLANET
The B-52's
Warner Brothers

When the B-52's first album was
released, I found it hard to believe
that they _,come from Georgia. Now
that their second album is out, I find
it hard to believe that they come from
this planet at all. Wild Planet is a
continuation of the humorous,
quirky pop sound heard on the debut

hasn't changed much, either. Last

. time around there was a song about
rock lobsters, and now there's one
about a pink dog with a wig who's
named ”Quiche Lorraine."

Thank heavens for an album that
doesn't have a single so-called "mean-
ingful” song tucked between its
grooves. This one's recommended for
anyone without long hair and earth
sandals.

Interplanetary pop for aliens and
non-aliens‘alike. "

WDVE, TPC and The Silencers have
amassed about 600 kids to take part in the
filming. Most of them are under 21 and
probably have never seen this hometown
. ‘band live thanks" to Pennsylvania's ancient

Blue Laws. ,

' The plot is simple. The Silencers

magically appear in the middle of the .

Strip District--stage, lights and  equip-

ment are set up in frontof the Banana

Factory as gangs of kids and extras come

pouring in from‘ the streets ‘and: V ‘

warehouses that surround.

The Silencers look impressive-~bla¥ck

‘ andtwhite suits, skinny ties and lots of
' churning rock ’n’,roll. as TPC films clips of

”Illegal,” "Remote Control" and ’’Peter
Gunn.".  I \ ' -

The,kids love ’em. V

Bird Foster‘ looks like a‘ high school
K principal with his neathair, mustache and
gold tiebar as he lays dow71 a smooth, '
su-re back-beat. ~ -

Czuri is his typical teen idol self. His
vocals never seem to be too much. He
tempers his delivery well with The '
Silencers’ clean, powerful, instrumental
,-assault.

 Warrenlin a gray suit and ‘black tie,

ultimate contra'st——an I Spy, gentleman
ripping through furious guitar leads. L

Pella and D.T. look equally smart and
self-assured.

Together, they are The Silencers-‘Pitts-g
burgh's strongest rock’n’roll band vet. I I
