An unusually large ‘crowd
packed the Student Government
Board meeting room on the
eighth floor of the  Pitt
Union last night, even though
three board members left early
because of their respective sorori-
ties’ bid nights. «

Around 30 people attended
the meeting, and about 20 were
members of Keep It Real, a stu-
dent organization that tutors
refugee families and children in
Pittsburgh. .

Keep It Real vice president
Nick Brown‘ said the group
showed up in large numbers be-
cause they expected to get denied
as a result of an allocation issue
from last year -with a ‘different
club.

The SGB allocations commit-
tee initially advised the board to
deny Keep It Real’s request for
$1,390 because the group had re-
quested money for the same event
before, which SGB precedent has
not allowed. . ' «

Brown and the other members
stood to address the board about

_ the ‘request. Brown explained that

Keep It Real requested $51,895 last

year for transportation costs, but .

prices were higher than expected
this year because of rising gas

a u * .
prices, he said.

The board denied the alloca— _

tions recommendation that would

have denied the request and mo- ,

tioned to approve the full addi-
tional cost of $1,390. ‘
Brown said he and the other
members had expected the board
to deny the request even after he
explained Keep It Real’s situation.

For T /25 Pitt New '

Fraternity brothers and soror-
ity sisters are doing a little rushing
around of their own as they pre-
pare to invite new members into
their respective organizations.

Sororities and fraternities have
different recruitment processes,
but both, which are taking place
now, involve about a week of

events through which potential

new greeks have the opportunity
to meet the brothers and sisters
in each organization.

Pitt’s sororities began their
recruitment week last Wednes-
day, 'when about 280 interested
recruits were divided into groups
led by sisters from various hous-

es, called'Rho Gammas, and vis-.

ited all eleven sororities, They

visited ifive houses on Wednesday"

and another six on Thursday.

-“It’s really fast—p.aced,” said
Megan Mulert, a member of
Delta Phi Epsilon sorority. .

A Mulert said that on the ﬁrst
two nights, the sisters can only
spend about 20 _ minutes with
each group of -girls. 4

But as rush week has pro-
gressed, the women rushing so-
rorities visited fewer and fewer
houses and spent more time with
each of them so that they could

narrow down their choices.

“I think it’s interesting that
each house emphasizes differ-
ent values that they believe in,”
said Molly Holmes, who went
through recruitment.

» On Friday night, interested
women visited the seven sorori-
ties that they liked the_ most, and
on Sunday night they visited their

.top four choices, provided that

the sororities invited them back.

variety of classes at Pitt, includ-
ing Introduction to Japanese
Literature, Westerns and Samu-
rai Films, Japanese Society and
Culture through, Cinema, Fourth
Year Japanese and Japanese Lit-
erature and the West. C
This semester, however, she
was on sabbatical leave.

Keiko, as she liked’ her stu-
dents to call her, died doing what

ln Memoriam: Keiko PM

she loved: ﬁshing.
The former professor and act-

ing chair of Pitt’s Department

of East Asian Languages and

Literatures died on Sunday, Sept.

14, 2008, from renal failure and
pulmonary ‘edema resulting from

A freshwater drowning, said the In-

diana County coroner’s office.
At the time of her death, Mc-

Donald, who was born in Nara,

Japan, was in the process of writ-

, ing two books. She had begun.
to revise “I-Iiroshi Shirnizu: A ,

Forgotten- Veteran of Children’s
Films,”.and “The Woman Behind
the Camera: Japanese Film Direc-
tors” is under contract from the
University of Hawaii Press. A
Throughout her career, Mc—'
Donald’s students and fellow fac-

ulty members praised’her strong’

work ethic, dedication to teach-
ing, warm personality and kind-
ness toward others. V ’
“She was a superb department
adviser for students, showing
understanding while maintaining’

CDonalcl

appropriate standards,” said Pitt
professor emeritus  Thomas
Rirner, who worked with McDon—,
ald on several projects, including;
a book called “Nara Encounters.”

This book matched photos of Ja- W

pan’s ancientcapital with bits of
literary and historical texts.

“This was her hometown,
and she did aremarkable job in;
locating out-of—the-way photos,
sections of novels or stories to
be translated, and a number of
other aspects of this complicated

SGB to vote on resolution next

He said the difference between
this request and the one the group
submitted last year was that Keep
It Real had no control over the
unforeseen costs.

“And to see it go smoothly, it
kind of made me think differently
about SGB,” added Brown.

Board member Amanda Reed
introduced a resolution to the
board that would recognize the
Student Vote Coalition, an effort
to register Pitt students to vote, as
the “sole voter registration entity”
on campus recognized by SGB
and Pitt administration. i

Reed said the resolution was
necessary so that SGB could rec-
ognize a credible organization for
student voter registration.

She said the goals are to ensure
that students can get their cards
in on time for the presidential
election and to encourage non-
partisan civic participation. The
resolution would not ban other
groups on campus from register-

ing voters.
 --Arte: Ilccd a1’rd'bOaI'CI‘In’€'ITﬂ5Ef~

Perry Servedio read the resolution,
the board tabled it to be voted on
during next week’s meeting.

Board member Ryan Haddad
announced that online registra-
tion is now available for Pitt Make
A Difference Day on Oct. 18, a
board effort to have students
do mass. volunteering in Pitts-
burgh. The Web site is www.pit:t.
edu/ ~pmad.

President Sumter Link said
he hoped the program would en-
courage students to give back to
the city.

“Students may get a bad rap,”
said Link. “Hopefully it will en-
courage civic responsibility. This
could show that we actually do
care about Oakland and the city.”

Board members Nila De-
vanath, Francee Varner and Lacee
Ecker left the meeting early.

because the money requested was
for travel expenses to an event
outside of the country.

A representative from
the organization said that two
years ago, the money had been
approved for a similar request and
that they would not be able to at-
tend the conference if the money
was denied.

Pitt Outdoors Club requested
$2,002 from SGB for a confer-
ence on the West Coast, but it was
denied.

A representative from that
club said that the board denied
the request because there may
have been a closer conference.
The Club, however, said there
were no closer conferences.

Groups welcome new

brothers and sisters

Greeks, page 2

  

 

Andrew Keelan / Senior Staff Photographer

Freshman Tyler Stipcak talks to brothers in Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and meets

’ some "cool new people," as he said.

On Monday, which was known as Pref.
Night, the potential sorority sisters visited
the two houses they were the most inter-
ested in.

Sororities capped off the recruitment
process last night after the women who
were rushing signed their bids.

Fraternity rush less formal

Fraternities also started their rush week
on Friday.

“It just gave those rushing an oppor-
tunity to meet some of the brothers,” said
Chris Kuncio, a brother in Phi Delta Theta
fraternity.

Kuncio’s fraternity held its first event in
the Williarn Pitt Union. Fraternities reserve
restaurants and other local venues to host
rush events. Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, for
example, held events at Boornerang’s and
Quaker Steak and Lube.

One night, they also held a barbecue at

 

but to the University as a whole.”

   
  

their house.

“We don’t try to bribe people with food
so that they come to events, but it always
helps,” said Kuncio.

Each fraternity also hosts a final event
on an invite—only basis for its potential new
brothers. Afterwards, the brothers vote on
which members they’d like to offer bids
to.

Unlike sorority rush, there is no for-
mal process where a potential recruit visits
every fraternity. Potential new members
can visit, or not visit, any rush event they
choose.

Rushing is open to all students, includ-
ing seniors.

“I rushed my sophomore year,” said
Ashley VanAlen, a sister of Kappa Delta
sorority. “As a transfer student, all of the
changes were difficult for me to grasp.
Rushing and joining really helped me to
feel connected, not only with my sisters,

Women embrace and cheer during bid night in front of the William Pitt Union. This

was the first time the new members joined with their respective sororities.

project,” said Rirner. “She proved herself

an ideal colleague.”
Paula Locante, the secretary and admin-
istrator of the Department of East Asian

Languages and Literatures, said that she

worked closely with McDonald last year
when McDonald was the acting chair of

the department.

“I learned a lot from her about trying

to stay calm and organized,” said Locante.

“And she’d frequently bring me prizes:
ﬂowers, wine and always a T—shirt or scarf
or jewelry from Japan.”

Locante added that she especially ad-
mired McDoriald’s strong dedication, love

;for her work, “no pain, no gain” motto,

cheerfulness, energetic personality and

overall radiance.

In 1963, McDonald obtained her under-

graduate degree in English, with a minor in
linguistics, from Osaka University of For-
eign Studies in Minoh, Osaka, Japan.

She later traveled to Sacramento to

complete her master’s degree at the State
University of California in 1966 and earned
-her doctorate degree at the University of

Oregon in 1974 after writing a dissertation
titled “In Search of the Orient: W. B. Yeats

{and Japanese Tradition.”

McDonald received numerous honors

The report states that too

5 eration into students who do

A well on AP exams, SAT sub-A
’ ject testsand other indicators

of how well a student under-

j stands information from his

high school curriculum. The
College Board, which owns

the SAT, defended its useful-

ness and have said that it’s a
fai_r and accurate measure of
how well a student will per-
form in higher education.

The NACAC has a point:
There are major problems

with the SAT. It doesn’t test

much of the knowledge that
students learn in high school
beyond ‘basic English .and
mathematics skills. It’s been
studiedso rigorously that SAT
prep courses are positively
abundant — and these courses
are often too expensive forev-
eryone but affluent students.

‘ For those who can afford the

courses, it reduces the test to

’ a reﬂex reaction, full of strat-
,_ egy and tricks instead of actual ,
 knowledge. ‘

While the new essay section
and changes to the SAT’s ver-

‘ bal criteria have made progress

in alleviating this effect, it’s still
apparent that the test doesn’t

i paint a complete picture of

a student. Instead, it reduces
students to numbers that are

easily scaled and weighed, to

the beneﬁt of some and to the
chagrin of many more.

There are also problems
with having colleges look at

-other indicators of applicant I

potential. While other~stan-

. dardized tests help admissions '
officers get a feel for students,

the fees for taking them all can
pile up quickly, which could
prevent  but upper-class ap-
plicants from taking the full

range. Placingjheavy emphasis A

on tests that many people'sim-

" ply can’t afford is hardly a fair 1

system.
Other suggestions are to al-
low students to send in a more

diversified portfolio of per- _

sonal material, such as multi-

ple essays and other work that ~ - i
could be relevant to whatthey

it could be -more complicated.
What happens when a poten-
tial studio arts major sends in
pieces of painting and sculp-
ture? Should the admissions
board look at other student art
to see whether it’s up to snuff,
or ask a critic?’ *

That, in effect, is the big-

gest problem with asking for

Nader's good, but not presidential

   

by. Giles Hovvard . A

national politics ‘has brought at-

. tention to issues that Republicans
,and Democrats would otherwise
‘ignore. _

I view Nader as the quintessential-

V  gadﬂy. He’s called for the irnpeach- ‘
: ments of George Bush and Dick
Cheney, ‘supported a single—payer

universal health care system and

worked to strengthen unions. He’s
taken unpopular, extreme positions
with which many other Americans

and I agree and‘ then had the cour-
age to take them to the ballot box.
But it’s at the; ballot box that

j V  -things getU:ic.ky-.' ‘
/ more in admissions boards to 
, make sure that the highest-

Nader doesn’t have the 

 organization or charisma to win a
{ presidential election in this country.
g Instead, his" campaign poses this

question to supporters: Why vote
for a candidate who has no chance

 to win?

Nader’s argument used toibe
that the Republican and Demo-
cratic candidates shared such simi-

.   ' lar worldviews and policy positions
 Ralph Nader has the nasty habit ‘ I
 of being right at the saine time that
 he’s wrong. He’s been something of
 a hero to me for years, butsupport—

j ing him tends to leave a sour taste in

; my mouth. ' 4 '

 I don’t regard him as-Va “spoil— V
i er.” In fact, I think that his ‘role in .

that the differencebetween them
was negligible.

For a while, Nader was _n3ght.
Republicans and Democrats have
shared responsibility for everything
from -NAFTA to the war in Iraq,
and certainly neither party’s leaders
have ever stood up for progressive
values the way Nader has.

. But this election is different.

In this election, there are more I

important issues than the Taft-
Hartley Act. Props to Nader for
consistently opposing’ paperless .
electronic voting machines, . but
I’m more worried about the over-
all economy and our position in the
world." ' .
Nader has always struck me as
unable to see the forest for the trees.

And although he’s a fearless crusad-

' erfor consumer safety and workers’

rights, foreign policy has never been

'.  forte.

That’s not meant as a criticism
of Nader as apublic ﬁgure, but
instead as a cniicism of him as a‘
presidential candidate. Nader would
probably make a great senator or
representative. ‘He could chair an
oversight committee and  auto-

industry reps to his heart’s_content,
and he’d « probably achieve some
good in the process. But his skills
aren’t presidential. A _
Of course, Nader’s not the only

_ presidential candidate with this
problem.

The economy is collapsing
around his ears and, like Nader’s
obsession  the Taft-Hartley
Act, John McCain is still talking

about congressional earmarks. A
And this is where the difference

between the two parties really mani-
fests itself. This is why Nader’s old

[rhetoric isn’t appropriate in this elec-

tion: Obama can articulate positions
on macroeconomic issues, while‘
McCain fantasizes about channel-
ing the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt

and using the presidency as a bully _ '

Church andplstate shouldstay Separate

. by Matthew Diabes

“No provision in our Consti-
tution ought to be dearer to man

than that which protects the rights‘

of conscience against the power
of its public functionaries, were it
possible that any of these should
consider a conquest over the con-
science of men.” These are words
from Thomas Jefferson, ’ explain’-
ing the value of the separation of
church and state. S

Today, Jefferson would be as-

tounded by the condition of this .

tenet of democracy in our society.
A shocking number of voters to-
day are rejecting the idea of this
separation by making religion a
deciding factor in elections. In
fact, according to the nonparti-
san, nonprofit organization Public
Agenda, 42 percent of Americans
believe it is not wrong to consider
seriously a candidate’s religion

' when deciding whom to vote for.

What is most concerning is
that this follows a global, war-

down barriers of cadence and lan-

The decision to set “The Iliad”

in WWII was sparked by Lombard’s
cover ——a photograph of the D-
Day landings called “Into the Jaws
of Death.” Though the use of

WWII soldiers to "portray the tale
could be controversial, Meineck, an
ex—U.K. marine, is sensitive to the
pain of that periodiof history. “It’s
very gentle,” said Donato, adding,
“It’s a wonderful way to engage with

Overclock your processor, rev up your computer

by Donald Campbell
~. Staff Writer

  

Processors today are marketed
solely by their clock speed. The
laptop used to write this article
is an Intel Core 2 Duo running
at 2.4 gigahertz. Simply put, the
clock speed is the heartbeat of
the computer. The rating of
the processor in any given com-
puter is not the end-all—be—all
of that machine’s performance,
though. Commonly, processors
can perform at a higher clock
rate. Higher clock rates do not
always guarantee better per-
formance, but they often help.

Processor manufacturing is,

surprisingly, a rather hit—or—miss V

endeavor. Out of a batch of pro-
cessors, many have errors; Some
are not capable’ of running reli-
ably at the frequency, or ‘clock
speed, for which they were origi-
nally intended. Others may not
work perfectly, at their recom-
mended clock speeds but could,
for general use, be very reliable.
Processors that are iffy are

often sold as lower-end proces-‘
sors —— such as the Intel Cel-

eron —-— or are simply sold to
run at a lower clock rate. All
processors are sold to run at a
clock speed that has been deter-
mined to be extremely reliable.

Where does this leave you? It
leaves you with some experimen-
tation. Your machine could have
its clock rate increased moderate—_
ly, possibly squeezing out a little
bit more performance, while not
impacting its overall reliability.
This practice, called overclocking,
has become signiﬁcantly easier
as computer BIOS and mother-
board technology have become
more advanced. Overclocking
can be accomplished without any
practical hardware, background.

How is this feat of hacker
engineering accomplished? As
with most things in the computer
world, it depends on your CPU
and your CPU’s manufacturer.
Some older motherboards re-
quire some jumper settings to be
changed. In other words, you are
required to open up your com;

  

puter and rearrange some simple

connections. A simple pair of
tweezers can replace jumpers.
Other motherboard manufac-

turers have written software to

modern processors will not over-

multiplier settings are changed. '
' Once again, depending on the

to run a 1.0 gigahertz processor, g

its cooling system may be unable

_, to handle the processor when it
is overclocked to 1.2 gigahertz. If _

you have any concerns over cool-
ing, add a fan to your computer
or look into buying a larger heat
sink to ﬁt over the processor.
_Overclocking in general can
give you some performance
gains. If done right and in the
right environment, a machine

can be made to run significantly-

faster than originally intended.
Additional information on over-
clocking can be found on the In-
ternet. There are articles that will
walk you through the exact steps
necessary to overclock a comput-
er successfully.

If you are the user of a pre-
built industry, computer, such as
a Dell or a_ Gateway, there may

even be step—by—step tutorials for _

sor model. just remember: Don’t
push your computer too hard,

Epic poem with modern touch invokes ﬁerce emotion

Iliad, page 14

that our actions should bring the greatest
good tb the greatest many.

Aquila’s mission mimics Bentham — ac-
cording to its Web site, its goal is also to “bring
the greatest works to the greatest many.”

Enter the first pairing: Hedonism, the pur-
suit of pleasure, derives from the Greek hedo-
nismos, meaning “delight.” While many audi-
ences might perceive classical theater to be the

antithesis of hedonism, Aquila has managed _

to pair the two.

Meineck is a classicist and translator. “He’s
incredibly knowledgeable,” said Donato. “The
company came about in part because working
in that medium, it’s only natural to want to see
the plays staged.” But as any eighth—grade class
tackling “Romeo and juliet” will tell you, mak-

ing classical works accessible and enjoyable to I

the modern reader or Viewer is no easy task.

Fortunately for audiences, Meineck ex-
plained, “Classical works become classics
because they are the best artistic works, and
they still speak to us.” Donato added, “Clas-
sical theater is the foundation for everything
that comes after. The themes are universal and
always will be.”

“The Iliad” tells the tale of the Trojan War,
focusingion the struggle within the Achaean
camp, events that took place 10 years after the

conﬂict’s beginning. The very first lines of the
epic poem invoke one of humankind’s fiercest
emotions:

Rage—Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’
son Achilles,

murderous, doomed, that cost the Achae—
ans countless losses,

hurling down to the House of Death so
many sturdy souls,

great fighters’ souls, but made their bodies
carrion,

“Most people perceive ‘The Iliad’ as a
poem or a book,” wrote Meineck, “but it was
originally a performance text.” In fact, the skill
of writing was lost in Greece in the centuries
after the Trojan War. Essentially, that means
that a written work of nearly 800 pages was
once encapsulated entirely within someone’s
brain and could be shared and performed over
the course of several nights.

Aquila will have only a few hours to pres-

ent the work. “We will attempt to tell the

whole first book in three 50 minute parts,”
said Donato.

“I think that we do brave theater,” said Do-
nato. “We explore works from classical drama
that are very true to their original form and
modern in their design. And they are always
accessible to all ages and communities.”

F lameneo dancers step into Pitt Union today

Artful Wednesdays, page 14
Clippingefs request After ﬁve years, she explained,
a whole new class of students will be enrolled at
Pitt—— students who would beneﬁt from exposure
to exotic musical presentations such as these

Artful \X/ednesdays officially started in 2003
with the intention “to have performances of 
quality right where students live,” said Clippinger.

Unofﬁcially, the program started in 2002 when
Clippinger had a trio perfonh in the lobby of
Litchﬁeld Towers For ﬁve years performances
were held there, but they have since been moved
to Nordyfs Place because renovations  the
space and layout of the building

“It was so great in the residence halls,”
Clippinger said of the music, “because students
would bump into it’ ’ A

In her ﬁrst experimentations with the Towers
setup, however, Clippinger noted that students
“clomping up and down the stairs” interrupted
quiet bands Acoustics were less than ideal,
and there was no  available for student

passersby.

 

That emphasis on diversity
clearly shapes the lineup,
drawing musicians and
dancers from four con-
tinents, as well as from

Pittsburgh.

 

‘Tm only bringing loud  to that
loud place,” said Clippinger upon noticing the
disruptive noise level of the lobby. There were

louder presentations, including music by chamber I

musicians, thereafter

Clippinger is optimistic about the new setup at
Nordyfs Place.

She also noted that students still “bump
into” performances as they did in Towers after
wandering in from Schenley Cafe in the Union.
“I ended up  happy because it’s comfy,’ ’ she
said.

The acts that students will bump into this fall
are an unusual assortment of art and music, the
combination forming the basis of the program.

“Diversity is Very important to me,” said
Clippingen

That emphasis on  cleariy shapes the
lineup,  musicians and dancers from four
continents, as well as from Pittsburgh.

- Namoli Brenner,  and songwriter, will
perform at Nordy’s Place on Oct 8. She is an

advocate for GLBT causes and has produced six
CDs on her own label. Rooted in folk but skilled
in many instruments, Brennefs music is difﬁcult to
categorize deﬁnitively.

Kenia & Company performs on Oct 15.
Kenia, whose fusion of Brazilian  and pop
brought her success in the ’80s and ’90s, has had
a vibrant music career  three decades and
including the release of six albums

The Pillow Project, a thematic artistic endeavor
featuring dance, video and graphic art, hailsfrom
Pittsburgh and is slated to perform at Nordy’s

Place on Oct 22.

Oct 2% performance is the Mata Suing
Quartet, featuring violins, viola and cello The
quartet plays a diverse selection of classical and
modern South American music.

Musuhalpa, a music group featuring
instruments from three countries in the Andean
Mountain regions, plays on Nov 5. Musicians will
playsongs featuringPeruvianpanpipes,aswe1las
unique percussion and string instruments from
Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru.

Pit1sburgh’sownDanoeAlloy'I'heaterprovides

the entertainment on Nov 12, combining ballet
and modern dance for theatrical impact;

Duende Carnaron plays on Nov 19 and
features spirited dance and song in the ﬂamenco
tradition.

Nordfs Place offers  and tables for
Artful Wednesdays’ free lunch and good acoustic
conditions, as well as a stage for performers

Artﬁil Wednesdays operates with a $16,000
budget  to Clippinger, which is used
to pay for lunch, technical staff and equipment

any chance of a Crossltouchdown.

But there’s more.

This play had the chance of working
either way.

"~Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt said after
the game that both quarterbacks ‘had
options, meaning if the defense would
have loaded the box, Stull would have
been the quarterback, and Cross would
have motioned out. A

In ‘that case, the play likely wouldn’t
have been a designed draw, but it would
have had options with the five—receiver
set. With Stull’s accuracy in the short
game, this play might have worked, too.
But if the defense is spread out, the ﬁekd
was wide open for the run. ‘

One Pitt player said the play was
designed completely as a draw for Cross.
The receivers were simply there as
decoys. This means Pitt still'isn’t entirely
comfortable with‘ Cross’ decision—making
or throwing ability. But this might change.

If Pitt can continue to complete passes
early, it will have a chance to run plays
with Cross more often. And if these plays
start showing passing options as well, the
offense could see some real explosion.

- Imagine if Cross becomes comfortable
making more throws. If the defense
assumes Cross is running, he’ll be able to
roll out and make the toss to ,a receiver
in single coverage. If they drop back and
cover the receivers, he’ll ‘do what he did
on Saturday. . ,

Either way, Pitt needs to get Cross into
the playbook a little more. He needs to be
makinghandoffs and some shorter passes.
This way, the "defense won’t always, know
what’s coming at it. .

After ‘the game, Wannstedt said he
plans on doing this. .

If opposing teams know Cross is
running on‘ every play, itwill meanvmore
10-yard losses — like the one we saw in the
fourth quarter on Saturday in his second
career play at Bitt,

» \X./e’ll likely see a good amount of Cross

on Saturday against a. Syracuse defense

that can’t seem to keep ‘anyone out of the

end zone.  c I
It’ll be a good chance to try some new

things and give Cross some experience.
Andif the dual—quarterback threat can

be more consistent in the game ‘plan, it

will just mean more and more problems
for the opposing defense. L .

lWeb sitesa tool‘ a

in job searches

by Kelly Thomas.
For T/ac Pitt Nerutr

Web sites like CareerBuilder.com
and Monster.com provide students

‘K with helpful tools to aid in their .
post—gra'duation job searches. How-

ever, they don’t replace traditional
methods of getting hired.

Allison Nawoj, a career adviser
at CareerBuilder.com, said that on-
line job search sites give both em-
ployers and job seekers more access
to each other. i

“Going online allows you to re-

ally spread your net wide,” said _Na-

woj. She added that for employers,
“One major beneﬁt is that they can

i get a lot of resumes very quicklyfi

To some, this may seem to put
job seekers, especially inexperi-

enced, recent graduates, at a disad-
vantage. Nawoj countered that no
matter where you look for jobs, the
market is competitive, and the key is
to make yourself stand out.

Brian Heddleston, the employ-
ment development manager of

Pitt’s Career Services, said, “As a.

candidate, you’re just one of many.
Being creative is the best way to ap-
P157.”

Heddleston said Careervservices

doesn’t encourage people to use job ‘

search Web sites because companies
usually post job opportunities on
their individual Web sites as Well. His
advice is to go directly to the source.
Research the company and contact
it instead of working through a
third-party Web site, he said.

Interviewing
easy to master

by Mike Ploetzf
For T be Pitt New

The art of the effective inter-
view isn’t as difficult to grasp as
you might think.

By doing your research and
dressing your best, you can in-
stantly go from “ho—hum hire”
to “Hey! This guy’s on ﬁre!”

That being said, a few core
principles are worth keeping in
mind.

Always remember that the
main purpose of an interview is
to sell yourself to the employer.
Everything you do and say tells
your interviewer something
about how you may (or may not)
ﬁt into the company’s plans.

On the subject of clothing,

moderation is key. Of course,
you should dress profession-
ally. For both guys and girls that
means a suit in conventionally
neutral and understated tones,
but keep in mind that it is pos-
sible to out—dress your inter-
viewer. ’

Barbara juliussen, the Career
Development Ofﬁce’s associate
director, said applicants should
also opt for subtle fragrances
and accents. And try to wear
only minimal jewelry.

Nothing turns off an em-
ployer more than the overpow-

ering scent of cheap cologne
— well, except for the sight of
an ugly tattoo stretching across
your arm. Decisions like these

When Pitt Employment Services
coordinator Danielle Scott walked into
her office on Monday morning, she
found a heap of job  awaiting

_ her approval.

, In one weekend, employers
interested in hiring Pitt students _sent
her applications to have 52 jobs placed
on the University’s FutureLinks Web
site, which allows students to post their
resumes online and employers to list

"That way, students’ ﬁumes will

Golf offers escape from 'realWorld' 

by Mike Gladysz
Co/ztrilmti/zg Editor

    

So, I heard my dad  about

[this place called “the real world.”

A .Apparently it’s the place‘ where

- people go after college — the

place where people get full-time
jobs, mortgages, 401 (k)s and health
insurance '
Ever heard of it? \Well, I have.
And I’m not going to lie to you guys:

It doesn’t sound fun.

 a job is hard. Applications,
interviews and paperwork are about
as much fun as  dropped into

Angry, hungry otters

and even showed up on time. And,
surprise, surprise, both places offered
me second interviews.

But here’s the  I didn’t like
either of them. And there’s no way
I’d be able to sit in an ofﬁce for eight
hours a day, for the rest of my life

So this isiwhat I’m going to do.‘

I7ve thought long and hard about how
to solve my problems and guarantee
happiness the rest of I my life

I’ve decided that I’m going to-be a
professional golfer. i

I already have the clubs, at good.

only that, but lately I’m getting a lot
better.

Last month I beat my dad for the
first time We’ve been playing together

made a’ bogey putt to win by two

let’s go down the list

Does work make me happy? No.

Long hours? No.

Mean boss? No.

Hard ﬁnancial decisions? No.

You get the idea.

Golf makes me happy. And if I
can manage to make it in the top-200

Shaun ‘Micheel currently ranks
200th on the PGA Tour "money
list. As the 200th best player on the
tour, he’s made $157,828 so far this
year. He’s played in only 16 events,
meaning he averages about $10,000
per day of work.

That’s about $9,984 mofethan
I make per day of work. And that
would be nice. 4

But it’s not just about the money.
The workday is short when you’re
a professional golfer. I can wake up

around 8 am., skip the shower and ,

head to the course, where I’ll warm

up for about an hour.

Around 9:30, I’ll step to the tee
box. About four hours later, I’ll get in
my car and head home

Not bad,.huh? p

There are no mean customers
on the golf course I play faster
than. most people, so there’s no tight

' deadline, either.

There’s no boss breathing down
my neck, and" no phone  off
the hook or e—mails to check.

Instead of a computer, I have a
scorecard. Instead of a secretary, I
have a caddy. Instead of tight pants
and a suit jacket, I have loose khakis
and a polo shirt

I guess there will be some work

involved. It’s called practice But"

practice is fun. It’s not like  a

presentation for the company CEO‘

or selling insurance door—to-door.
My caddy will carry my clubs all the
time, and if I’m on the tour, I’ll likely
get a sponsorship. That will pay for

practice rounds. ..
So far this

year, lVIicheel is

averaging a score of 72.9 per round.

He’s 39 years old.

While I’m probably averaging a. 93
or so per round, I’ve been improving
my score by about two or three
strokes every year. And I’m only 21.

That means in two years, I’ll be
 90. In five, I’ll be around 78.
By the time I’m in my late 20s, I can
drive Micheel down to spot 201.

I’ll be roaming the local courses,
putting for birdie and sporting my
SPF—70 suntan lotion.

By that  people with real jobs
will be sweating out their quarterly
review, hoping to get that bonus and
wondering how traffic will be on the
 home.

And if you’re one of those people,

Professional Wardrobe key to interview

by Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Although a stylish outﬁt
alone won’t win over a future
employer, it deﬁnitely doesn’t
hurt.

Would you hire someone to
deal with important customers
and represent your company if
he walked in for his interview
wearing ill-ﬁtting, stained pants,
an unbuttoned, unltucked shirt
and messy hair? Probably not.

First impressions are

. important. You may have a
killer resume, but if you don’t

have the presentation to go
along with it, the conversation
you have won’t matter much.
Do you want your interviewer
to be staring in shock at your
inappropriate outﬁt or staring
in awe at the intelligent answers
you give to his questions?

The typical interview dress

code is business professional,
but this can vary depending on
the company and the industry.
If it’s a creative ﬁeld, you may
want to look a bit more relaxed
so that you don’t seem stuffy.
If you’re going the traditional
route, here are a few guidelines
to help you land your dream job
(and look great while doing it).

For the gentlemen, business
professional entails a suit, dress
shirt and matching tie. Dress
shoes should match the outﬁt
and be clean and scuff—free.
And don’t forget to make sure
that your socks match, too.

When choosing your suit,
it’s best to choose conservative
colors like black, gray or navy.
Steer clear of the color red. It’s
pretty bold and is often seen as
a “power” color.

And remember: no hats,
no denim, no sneakers and no

sweats, and take it easy on the
cologne.

Make sure everything ﬁts
properly. Tuck in your shirt,
and see that it’s neatly pressed
for maximum impact. Ah, you
look like a CEO already!

Dressing professionally is a
little trickier for women. You
don’t want to look frumpy and
boring, but you also don’t want
to “dumb yourself down” by
wearing clothes that are too
trendy or sexy.

A skirt or pantsuit is a
safe bet. And again, wear
conservative clothes that come
in neutral colors. No bright
blue or neon green, please.
Underneath your jacket, wear
a button—down shirt in a
coordinating color or a dressy
top with a modest neckline. We
know you have goodies, but
your interviewer doesn’t need

to see them.

And watch your skirt length.
It should be long enough that
you can sit down comfortably in
public. You don’t want to send
the message that you’ll be using
skills other than those listed on
your resume to work your way
up the corporate ladder.

Your shoes should be
a reasonable height. You
_ shouldn’t look like you’re

auditioning to be the sixth
Spice Girl. And like your suit,
make sure that your footwear is
a traditional color and not too

ﬂashy. Steer awayifrom glitter,"

sparkles and excessive jewelry
and makeup.

Avoid attire.
Bermuda shorts and ﬂip—ﬂops
aren’t suitable for interviews.

For the ﬁnishing touches,
take off your chipped nail
polish, carry a nice, matching

S1.11'I11'I1€I.'

bag, and wear panty hose. I

know, I know. Panty hose are
associated with old ladies.
Nevertheless, they polish off
your look, and the interview
will last probably an hour at the
most, so it won’t be long before
your legs can breathe again.

It’s important to feel
comfortable and conﬁdent
when you go into an interview,
so make sure that you’re at ease
with whatever you decide to
wear.

If you’re not sure that you
can tell what’s appropriate, try
calling the company’s Human
Resources department and
ask for a dress code. When in
doubt, overdress.

Finally, think of your clothes
like you would think of a
resume it just gets you in the
door. It’s up to you to let your
personality shine through.

Online Writers earn thousands per month

For T be Pitt New

\We might as well admit it:
Everything in society has to
move at warp speed. Wireless
Internet, text messaging, food
outlets — and cash flow.

_ The Internet may be one of
the best places to make money
‘quickly. Just type in “make
cash fast” or something along
those lines, and more than 1.5
million options will be placed
at your fingertips."

The top results I noticed
were selling items on eBay and
online writing. Because we
can only sell so much before
we have an empty living space

and no clothing, harnessing ,

best bet for fast cash.

The top three answers are

Associate Content,
HubPages, Squidoo and
thisisby.us are great places
to start your search. Each
site seems to carry the same
general message: Sign up, start
writing about something you
love, and get paid.

One of the highest—ranked
jobs is that of a product
reviewer. Essentially, all you
have to do is create a review
on your own Web site and join
an affiliate program for the

product.
One Web site, eHow.
com, offers step-by-step

instructions: “Be passionate.
Be interesting. Be honest. Be
detailed. Be consultative.”

Just run a search, and you
can find plenty of companies
looking for online writers,
probably because many people
don’t take the time to hone
their writing skills.

Does this seem too good
to be true? Well, of course,
there’s always a catch. Nothing
comes easy in life, even on the
Internet.

One downside is that the
Internet is not a simple place.
It’s vast and unorganized,

At the ripe old age of, say,
22 or 23, it may seem a little
macabre to think about things
like retirement funds and life
insurance policies. But when
you sign on to your first full-
time job, odds are a few of these
terms will pop up.

Retirement terms

401 (k) n. — the most
common form of a deﬁned
contribution retirement plan.
Your boss deducts money —-—-
you choose the amount —-— from
your paycheck and places it in a
savings account for you.

Bonds n.’ — ‘You loan a
company money, and it agrees to

 fund n. —

pay you back either on a specific
date or at a future date of your
choosing. You make money
because the company pays you
interest.

De ‘ﬁned con 'tri 'bu 'tion
retirement plan 11. — a retirement
account that your employer

sponsors.

In °di 'vid -u 'al Retirement
Account (IRA) n. — a savings
plan with some tax breaks. IRAs
come in several different forms.
A traditional IRA, for example,
requires you to pay taxes only
when you make withdrawals.
One of the most common, the
Roth IRA, allows your money to
grow tax-free.

occurs
when a group, usually consisting
of thousands of people, decides

to invest in something together.
Participants in a mutual fund
may invest in large companies,
stocks, bonds or real estate. They
split the fund’s gains or losses.

Pen ' sion n. — an account
that your boss maintains so that
he can give you a salary after you
retire.

Re ' tire ' ment n. —— a time
in life when you don’t have to
work, and no one can make you
feel bad about it.

Social Security 11. — A portion
of your paycheck goes into
Social Security. So, when you
retire, you can, in theory, collect
It.

Stocks ‘n. —— Those things
that always seem to_ go up and

into a frenzy. Actually, though,
they’re shares in a company. You
can make money off of them
if they become worth more
than you paid for them, or if
the company decides to issue
dividends, which are payments
given to shareholders that reﬂect
the company’s earnings.

Health insurance terms

Health in 'sur °ance n. — that
thing you rely on whenyou need
some meds, visit a doctor or
break a few limbs falling down
the stairs.

Health main ' te ' nance
organization n. — a form of
health insurance in which
members pay a ﬁxed monthly
fee. They must generally choose
from a select group of doctors.

to do the follow-up,” she said.

Many Web sites like Career-

.Builder.com and Monster.com allow
users to create proﬁles and upload
resumes. They also post tips that
tell applicants how to make their re-
sumes stand out.

Nawoj cautioned that generic
resumes are not likely to make a
student attractive to companies. Ap-
plicants, she said, should tailor their
applications for the job they want.

Heddleston agrees. He said that
writing a more personalized cover
letter addressed to the proper person
is better than simply addressing the
letter “To whom it may concern.”

 
      

A better way to ﬁnd work.

 

r;¢s'54‘ rhea-we {me An. ceié, er 3-ppéf  ‘é=m$ag.~

Because online job postings get
so many responses, some employers
look for speciﬁc buzzwords in their
applicants’ resumes and cover let-
ters, Nawoj said. They scan the doc-
uments for those words, and if they
don’t ﬁnd them, they often move on
to the next applicant.

“Sometimes it’s just a matter of
selecting proper keywords and put-
ting buzzwords in your resume,”
said Nawoj.

In addition, Nawoj advised stu-
dents to use more than one job
search site and to use all the re-
sources available to them, not just
the Internet. The key to success is
doing a “combination of everything
you can handle, while still handling a
student workload.”

Many students agree that job
search sites are convenient. Pitt
sophomore Phil DiCicco said he
used Monster.com to look for in-
ternships.

“The application process was

complicated, and the results were
mediocre,” said DiCicco. “I rate
Monster a C-.”

Another sophomore, Nick Kelly,
said, “Nothing beats personal con-
tact.” Despite low grades, Kelly said
he was able to get a lab job because
the employer liked his personality.

At the same time, he said that he
agreed that searching for jobs online
could open up doors.

“I’d be down to seeing what is
available,” he said.

Although job search Web sites
provide a valuable service, students
shouldn’t forget the basics of ap-
plying for jobs: Make your resume
stands out, tailor it to the position,
and always follow up with the com-
pany after submitting an applica-
tion. ' A

“I think [job search sites] are
deﬁnitely a beneﬁt to all people ap-
plying,” said Nawoj. “It’s a matter of
ﬁnding the right mix for you.”

The members must delegate tasks,

“all the littie logistics” of general event-

schoolwork.

Senior Iauren Cavalier said that she
knows the process well Cavalier serves as
the alumni relations chair for Alpha Delta
Pi sorority and interns at the Pittsburgh

As an intern, Cavaliers responsibilities
include “assisting in the planning and exe-

heart association hosts each year. Cavalier
knew the Gala director; Mary Catherine
Houser, betnuse she is the recruitment
advisor for Alpha Delta Pi.
