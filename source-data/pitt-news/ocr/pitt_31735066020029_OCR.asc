Freshmen participated in a life-size Twister game on the Cathedral lawn during the first day of orientation.

Freshmen t tste of net four years

By Cindy Fish

Groups of incoming freshmen
began orienting themselves to Pitt's
campus thislpast weekend.

, Participation varied, with some
freshmen getting involved in the ac-
tivities offered and others just watch-
ing. .

This year the orientation provided
a taste of everything, from
watermelon with the Greeks to a
dance in the student union with some
live music from The Affordable Floors
and Hector in Paris.

”The dance was alright. I thought
The Affordable Floors were pretty
good,” said Steve Salvatore, a
freshman who admitted that he real-
ly hasn't gotten involved with much
of the orientation schedule.

Lynne Skerlec, a freshman who
has basically gotten involved, stated

. that she ”didn’t like the bands too .

much, but got the feeling that others
enjoyed them.”

Freshmen Allyson Harkness, Tonya Sheffield, David Agate.

However, Skerlec said that she
believed orientation to be very
beneficial to freshmen and that it was
a really good way. to meet people.

Jared Zerbe and Tiffany Russo, two
freshmen who recently met during
orientation, had basically the same
opinion of the events offered during
orientation.

’’It wasn't worth going to,”said
Russo of most of the events she had
been to. Zerbe, who only attended
the dance on Sunday night, said

about the rest of orientation, ’’I don't
do things like that.”

Tiffany and Jared did come to a
mutual conclusion that the dance
was really enjoyable and that they
were able to meet a lot of people
there. _

At Monday's watermelon picnic,
held on the Cathedral Lawn by the
Greeks, Jo Ellen Kelly, a member of
Kappa Kappa Gamma, explained the

”The watermelon picnic is to
welcome students to Pitt, and en-
courage them to go Greek,” said Kel-
ly. ’’It’s a good way to meet people
and we're trying to encourage
freshmen to go through rush so that
they get involved in Pitt life."

Jim Bihiou, a freshman who attend-
ed the watermelon picnic, is think-
ing about pledging a fraternity during

rush.

l5ihiou’s friend, Steve Salvatore, ex-
pressed an interest in the Greek
system by attendin.g the picnic, but
then explained,”l don't want to
pledge a fraternity yet. I want to get
settled first.” .

Allyson Harkness already _ had
pledging a sorority in mind before
coming to Pitt. She signed up for rush
through the mail and seems excited
about the rush events coming up this
week.

Harkness also expressed optimism
regarding the entire orientation pro-
gram. ”|’ve gone to all the events so
far, and it seems to give students a
good idea _of the school,” she said.
’’I would recommend going to orien-
tation for future students.”

Along with the adjustments of

purpose of such an event for , meeting new people, a lot of

freshmen.

NAPLES, Fla. — Pennsylvania
tobacco heir Steven Wayne.Benson
was sentenced Tuesday morning to

j two consecutive life sentences for the

pipe bomb murders of his mother

’ and adopted brother. Benson, 35,

also received an additional 22 years
in prison on six lesser charges. Pros-
ecutors had argued for the death
penalty for Benson, who now must
spend at least 50 years in jail before
being eligible for parole. Benson had
already been convicted of the
murders of his mother Margaret and
adopted brother Scott. Prosecutors
said Benson feared he was going to
be eliminated from his mother's will
—— and a share of a multi-million
dollar fortune — so he acted to make
sure he would not. Witnesses said
Benson showed no emotion as he
was read the verdict.

Pretoria bombing

injures 18

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
Police said Tuesday afternoon that a
bomb left at a parcel counter of a
store Monday blew out the entire
front of the store, injuring 18. A

police spokesman said four people
were seriously hurt, including a
3-year-old white child.

Khadafy calls

Reagan ”mad”
, 
TRIPOLI, Libya — Moammar
Khadafy celebrated his 17th anniver-
sary as Libya's leader Monday. He
marked the occasion with verbal at-
tacks on President Reagan and praise
of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
In a speech to a large crowd in
Tripoli’s Green Square, Khadafy said,
”Reagan is a madman, physically and
psychologically sick. If Reagan
doesn't stop his stupidities I will form
an international army to fight
Americans everywhere, and I am sure
that in a few years the world will be
rid of this new Nazi empire.”
Khadafy’s outburst comes after four
months of silence following the U.S.
bombing raid on Libyan targets in
Tripoli, which killed the adopted
baby daughter of Khadafy. State
Department sources have hinted in
recent weeks that the United States
may be considering a pre—emptive
strike to thwart another planned ter-
rorist act by Libya. But Khadafy said

Tobacco heir gets consecutive life terms

ing charges was allowed to visit with
him Monday. After the meeting, Ruth
Daniloff, wife of Nicholas Daniloff,
said the Soviets plan to keep him in

jail for 10 days before deciding
whether to release him or formally
charge him with spying. Daniloff

called the alleged spying charges ”a
complete farce" and said she feared
her husband would be put on trial.
The chairman of the magazine, Mor-
timer Zuckerman, described the jail-
ing of his Moscow correspondent as
”a phony arrest based on contrived

circumstances.” State Department
sources think the arrest is in retalia-
tion for an arrest ofan alleged Soviet
U.N. spy, Gennady Zakharov, in
New York. Daniloff told his wife he

was framed and said that he was
meeting with a Soviet acquaintance
Saturday night when that man hand-
ed him a package, which he did not
know the contents of. Daniloff said

at that point he was jumped by eight
KGB agents and arrested. The Soviets
later said the package contained
maps marked ”Top Secret” and
photos of Soviet military installations.

Waiting in line for football tickets vides a perfect chance for Alana Karle to get to know new friends. 

Students ready for Panther season

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Pitt football is now in action. After
a rigorous summer practice, new
head coach Mike Gottfried, along
with the Panther team, is ready for
the scrutiny of the public eye.

Fan support is an important aspect
in college football. It boasts the
morale of the players. But after last
year's mediocre season student sup-
port seemed questionable for the up-
coming year.

Or so it did.

Students waited in line for over an
hour this past Monday for tickets to
the Pitt-Maryland game.

Freshman Alana Karle didn't get a
season pass, but she was intent on go-
ing to the first game, regardless of the

line for tickets. ”I’ve never been to
a Pitt game. I've never even seen the
stadium, but I hope the team has a
good season.”

Sophomore Pat Rivas didn't seem
to mind the wait either. ”It’s the first
game of the year,” he said. ”There’s
no use staying up in my room
tonight.” ’

Rivas said that he didn't sign up in
time for a season football pass but he
intends to get one.

Sophomore Woody McCor also
plans on getting a season pass but for
the present time he thought that
waiting in line was worth it. ”lt’s go-
ing to be a good game. They [the Pan-
thers] have some rough scheduling,
but I expect them to. do good,

especially with the new coach.”

There were other students though,
who said that they would never have
waited in line for over an hour.

Senior Andy lezzi, who worked in
the student union passing out tickets
was suprised by the crowds. ’’I’d
have come ten minutes before the
game to get my ticket. There were
people who waited over an hour.
That's crazy.”

One student was upset that the first
game wasn't free, as it was last year.
’’It would be a better way to get
students to go to the games,” said
sophomore Gary Star. ”Students are

skeptical because of the team. I think‘

that there's so much controversy sur-
rounding the team they aren't going
to do well.

”Gottfried seems like he'll be a .

great coach, but in my opinion it's
going to take him more than one year
to get the team to respond.”

Star did say that he was going to
the game though.

Other students admitted that they

l.lVI

‘III

NION B

4TH AT

l\ "fl

didn't even care if the team won or
lost.

Larry, a senior who wished to be
identified by his first name only, was
tailgating at the Syria Mosque
preceding the game. ”The games are
like a big party," he said. ”Look
around, half of the students here just
go toget crazy. It's also nice because
it brings students together.”

So what happens after a 10-7 loss?

”It was a good game,” said senior
Jeff Frelic. ”The offense looked real-
ly good and both defenses looked
good. I think they'll [the Panthers]
suprise a few teams.”

Frelic said he plans on attending

the rest of the Panther games.
' Whether they go to watch the
game, to party or to criticize, it seems
that a few losses are not going to stop
Pitt students from attending Panther
games.

Squirrel Hill, the owner of a
40-apartment complex known as
Parkview Estates, was attempting ‘P
to evict Donald Hatchin, 38, of
Oakland when Hatchin pulled
out a gun and shot him. Hatchin
then took his own life. -
Earlier in the day police said
they tried to settle a rent dispute

Help wanted:

1988 president

His name is Lido Anthony Iacocca, and he doesn't want
to run for president of the United States. Not now, not
in 1988, not ever. He has said so on several occasions
and becomes almost irate at the prospect's mention. He
has said, ''I’m not running for anything — except maybe
my life." So the man who has entered America's collec-
tive living room selling Chrysler Corporation products
won't take an $11 million-plus cut in pay to work in
Washington.

Why has Lee Iacocca gained the trust of the American
public? Why is the American public pleading for his can-
didacy? Furthermore, why have so many non—politicians
gained notable momentum in their quest for the Oval Of-
fice? Are we afraid of politicians and the way they govern?

Since our last great politician, Richard M. Nixon, we've
elected a peanut farmer and an actor to the highest of-
fice. Now we clamor for a car maker on the Democratic
ticket and an evangelist on the Republican ticket.

Who is this religious crusader? Pat Robertson. He is one
man who is serious about his White House hopes. His
message is clear. A moral nation will be a successful na-
tion! His views are not much different from those of our
current president. Whether or not Pat Robertson gains ac-
cess to the Rose Garden, his presence will be felt in '88.

By supporting non—politicians, the American people are

‘saying something. Mr. Reagan may not be solving

everyone’s problems, he may be creating new ones, but
he makes us feel good. We have an omnipotent grand-
father looking over us. We've needed that.

Now that we feel good, we need something else. This
something else is shown by the men we're begging to run
for the presidency. We need a problem-solver.

Our country now has the largest national budget deficit
in its short history. We have a dollar that is losing value
in world markets. We have a trade deficit that continues
to grow in spite of concessions made by those with whom
we trade. Who can solve these problems? Lee Iacocca.

Iacocca would certainly make the American dollar
strong again. Look at what he did at Chrysler. He took
over a company that was losing $6 million a day in 1978
and guided it — by 1983 the company made a profit of
$350 million. His street—tough approach to finance cou-
pled with his charisma would prove invaluable if he were
to run for president.

Iacocca, Robertson, Hart, Bush, Kemp — the name is
not important. The man we choose in '88 is important.
In the men who are now gaining popularity, we see the
qualities we want in a president. We want someone who
can solve our nation's problems. Be they financial, moral
or both, we want a man who will do more. Be aware now.

Don't blame tuition hikes
on maintenance workers

On July 3, I was interested to read
a local newspaper's article interview-
ing Mr. Posvar in which he stated the
reason for the tuition increase at the
University of Pittsburgh for the fall.

Being a union maintenance worker
for Pitt, I was delighted to hear about
the "5 to 6 percent inflation-busting
raise” for this year. After seven
months of intense negotiations the
maintenance staff won ’a 1.7 percent-
a-year increase (including benefits)
for the next three years. (Only 1 per-
cent for those employees with less
than 10 years.)

‘Presently, the university is
negotiating a wage cut with the
custodial and building stationary
engineers. The administration staff
within the university organization
may have received this phantom raise

LETTERS

but it was not reflected in the
maintenance staff's salary increase.

It comes as no surprise to find that
for every one maintenance task there
is a "rabbit hutch" of administrators.
Apparently, President Posvar does
not measure this ever-growing ad-
ministrative staff's daily work output
with the same yardstick that measures
the maintenance workers. If this were
true the raise percentage might well
be reversed.

Mr. Posvar, please do not include
the maintenance salaries as an excuse
for higher tuition.

I think it is time you treated your

maintenance employees with the
same fair hand and respect as your
faculty. Or perhaps you should enroll
yourself in the university's "informal
program” for mathematics (if you can
afford the tuition) and then
recalculate our raise. '

Oakland apartments infested
with cockroaches, rats, mice

I had the unfortunate experience of
witnessing my first landlord/tenant
conflict today.

g My roommate and I were standing
in front of our apartment on Monday
afternoon when somebody ap-
proached us. He had just arrived in
Pittsburgh and was prepared to move
into his new apartment. He told me
a story that, regretfully, happens too
many times to too many people.

He and his best friend signed a
lease and paid a security deposit on
an apartment in South Oakland last
spring. It is in a large townhouse, and
when they went to look at it last
year, their landlord showed them a
furnished model to give them an idea
of how theirs would look. They were
told that their place was in much the
same condition as was the model.
They signed and paid before ever
seeing or setting foot in their par-
ticular unit. ‘

The summer passed, and they
came back to school ready to move
in. They opened the door of the
apartment expecting to see
something from Architectural Digest.

What they found was a rfjggtgmece

of 'lli'dEistatement. Their ”modern,
furnished apartment" had one
dresser, a kitchen table, peeling paint,
cracked walls and assorted vermin.
They refused to move in and de-

  

FA

 

manded a refund from their landlord.
She refused. They're taking her to
court.

What I saw today should not hap-

spen. It's as much the student's fault

as it it the landlord's. Students who
are in a hurry to move out of the
dorms naively accept everything the
local landowners tell them. That's
nothing new, and it's something that
15 not. going to go away_ S3,';‘,'e peo-
Ple W'll 3l‘.,‘v'2i'ys be greedy, others will
always be naive. I'd like to propose
something that could avert situations
like this in the future.

The SGB, the ORL or the Housing
Office should set up an ”Off-Campus
Housing Agency" to inspect apart-

ments that Pitt students would like to
rent. if the agency finds a unit to be
satisfactory and the landlord/manager
to be tolerable, the unit would be
awarded a Pitt "seal of approval."
The agency could set up a directory
of approved residences. If this pro-
gram were properly managed and
publicized, it could be successful.
Students would rent the approved
units because they know that they're
not going to get screwed, and
landlords would clean up their acts
because they know they stand abet-
ter chance of renting their approved
units.

A program like this would save off-
campus students needless headaches
and money. it would make a lot of
people much happier to be here and
could help to reverse the feeling ex-
perienced by many of us who have
fled the dorms: the feeling that Pitt
has abandoned us, that we've
forfeited our rights to protection from
the perils of the real world.

Woodson, Dr. Kimbo, Mr. Hughes
and anybody else with any pull in our
community, listen to my proposal. I
know that this will cost money, and
take time and effort, but it will pro-
vide a much needed service for the
students, which, after all, is why you
hold the positions you do."

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 3, I986

 

Q. We are two secretaries, both
married, one pregnant, with a young,
male, married boss who comes on to
one of us when the other steps out
of the office, askingus to make love
and joking about it when we refuse.
We don't want to take him to court
because he needs help, but it's a
pain. What can we do?

A. Nothing you describe is grave
enough or threatening enough for
you to take him to court. On the
other hand, you don't have to put up
with this obnoxious behavior.

There are many ways to deal with
this effectively, but I suggest that the
two of you corner him together and
say, ”Look, a little kidding is fun, but
this has become unfun — even if we
are flattered that you like us. We like
working for you, but out with this
clowning around because it makes us
uncomfortable. We don't want to
look for other jobs, but we will if
forced — both of us."

Perhaps you would have trouble
chorusing that message in unison, so
divide it up between .you, like the
two people on a news show.

Q. My husband said there are
vaginal orgasms, and he told the mar-
riage counselor that he had a girl-
friend who had six vaginal orgasms
in a row. The counselor laughed and
said she was a great actress and
deserved an Oscar. I can climax only
when he stimulates the clitoris direct-
ly, and he said this means I'm inade-
quate. What do you say?

A. I say that if I had been the
counselor I might have said the same
thing because it is all too possible that
your husband is exaggerating [about]
that other woman's orgasms (or she
was). But we have to face it — some
women do have multiple orgasms.

Multiple orgasms are not needed
for a great sex life, but some women
do have them, the way some people
always sneeze more than once. Three
times seems to be the number for
multiple sneezers. Possibly this

-former girlfriend was fond of the

number six and would have six
orgasms in a row. .
But not "vaginal orgasms."

The vaginal orgasm was a bugbear ‘

that did much harm to people who

The Refrigerator:

In the annals of momentous news
events it is likely to be forgotten
within days,but the action of William
Perry of the Chicago Bears in a na-
tionally televised football game with
the St. Louis Cardinals last Saturday
night deserves some belated
comment.

Perry, for those who did not see it,
approached St. Louis quarterback
Neil Lomax during the first half.
Lomax was holding the football, hop-
ing to throw it. Perry wrapped his
arms around Lomax. Then he lifted
Lomax into the air. He let Lomax
hover for a moment. Then he threw
Lomax to the ground. Firmly.

This was the subject of heated
discussion by the television comm_en-
tators. One said that a whistle should
have been blown as soon as Lomax
was in the grasp of Perry. Another
went so far as to say that Perry should
be suspended for what he did. Many
observers said that the ugly mood
began from the time Perry threw
Lomax tolthe ground. Even Perry's
own coach, Mike Ditka, said, "I

wouldn't want to see my quarterback
tackled that way, and I can see why
a coach would be upset.”

In the words of one commentator,
”Quarterbacks are too valuable to
allow that to happen.” The point was
that as soon as a defensive player has
stopped a quarterback’s motion — as
Perry did when he wrapped his arms
around Lomax — all action on the
field should be called to a halt.

Indeed, if you had watched the
play in question, you would have
winced for quarterback Lomax. One
can only imagine what it feels like to

f be held aloft by William Perry and

then slammed to the ground.

Whatever success Perry has attain-
ed in life dates back to those early
days when it was impressed upon
him that iﬂhe were to pick up smaller
people and hurl them to the ground,
then good things would happen to
him. -

The chances of Perry ever making
it out of his boyhood home ofAiken,
S.C., would have been much more
remote had he not discovered that he

read about it. There was supposed to
be an orgasm that women got with-
out the stimulation of the clitoris. And
any ”mature" woman was supposed
to have that kind of orgasm.

This idea is no longer credited by
any responsible authority. All female
orgasms are triggered by the clitoral
nerve ends, no matter how the

 

. _.;.-.. ,

had the power to pick up smaller
people and hurl them to the ground.

So, by picking up Neil Lomax and
hurling him to the ground, Perry was

'0 only continuing his life's destiny.

That destiny changed last year, of
course, when Coach Ditka allowed_
Perry to carry the ball on offense, and
suddenly the whole country was talk-

, ing about the man referred to as ”The

Secretaries find their employer toobossy-

orgasm is achieved or how "big" it
is or where the woman feels that it
seems to be located.

If you have an orgasm by any
means at all you are fortunate
because many women have not
learned to have one at all. So tell that
husband to tune out that sports chan-
nel and read some of the up—to-date
books on sexuality. And tell him not
to go around calling names — two
can always play at that game.

Q. I love the idea of doing all kinds
of things with my girlfriend, but in ac-
tual practice I often wonder if many
things I have read about aren't just
fantasies, impossible to do. For in-
stance, trying to please my girlfriend
orally, I can't breathe.

A. When trying something new for
your mutual repertoire, always keep
in mind that it has to be possible and
safe, OK? Don't swing from a chan-
delier; it makes a bad trapeze outside
of fantasy. For pleasuring your
girlfriend orally, let her raise herself
by putting a pillow under her or lie

Refrigerator."

Suddenly Perry was expected to be
articulate on talk shows, gregarious
with the press, cooperative with
photographers, charming in
restaurants and approachable on the
street by autograph seekers.

Some of these things Perry did bet-
ter than others. But it must have all

. been very puzzling to him. Here was

a young man who had been tutored
in one thing — picking up smaller
people and hurling them to the
ground — and now the whole world
was expecting him to be_ta|ented at

a whole raft of unrelated duties.
One thing can be said about the

Neil Lomax incident: It wasn't a
stereotypical case of why a lineman
treats a quarterback roughly.
Psychologists and sportswriters will
tell you that the reason linemen
sometimes act ungently with quarter-
backs is because quarterbacks are the
glamour boys, the ones who get the
bigger paychecks, the more lavish
publicity and the greater adulation
from fans. Linemen resent this.

mutual act and needs her coop-
eration.

Q. I've been going with my present
boyfriend for two years. I don't want 
to marry him, yet I don't like to tell
him no and hurt him. I think he might
do something if I do turn him down
definitely.

 

A. But you can't marry the guy’
because you hate to hurt his feelings,
that will lead to hurting his feelings “ '
worse later on. If you think he might
harm himself you have to urge him
to see a psychiatrist. If he seems likely , .
to do such a thing or threatens to do " ._ , 
that, he needs help, seriously — not . 
just you being super careful of his ' V
feelings. If he threatens, take» it
seriously, but don't marry him. That
is no basis fora marriage.

Faculty and administration clash

~ By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

For more than four years, a group
called the United Faculty has been
trying to organize a collective
bargaining unit for the full- and part-
time faculty at Pitt's main and
regional campuses.

So far, the efforts of the faculty
members, led by Philip Wion, a pro-
fessor in the English department,
have been unsuccessful.

Since 1984, when the group peti-
tioned the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board for the right to hold an

3' . election, the United Faculty and the

administration have been in a legal
battle.

. "We are working toward a co|lec- A
tive bargaining unit for the faculty,”
. Wion said.

The Pitt News is the official student newspaper
of the University of Pittsburgh.

    First meeting Thurs

 

The Pitt administration has based
its objections on the Yeshiva Deci-
sion of the United States Supreme
Court. In that 1980 ruling, the court
decided that the full-time faculty at
Yeshiva University in New York
would not be allowed to unionize
because its role in admissions and
other matters were managerial rather
than employee functions. Thus they
were not entitled to the benefits of
collective bargaining under the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act.

Wion said that "the Pitt situation
is different. That case referred to a
private institution whereas Pitt is a
state-supported school and falls
under state law. The Yeshiva decision
was for schools under federal
jurisdiction. Pennsylvania law should
not be interpreted along federal
lines." He went on to say that ”the

university does not have to make the

claim of the Yeshiva decision 
Posvar's position on this issue is not
only anti-union, it's anti—democratic.”

Scott Zimmerman, an attorney with
the law firm of Rothman and Gordon
has represented the university for 20
years. He said Posvar's position is
based on the Yeshiva case Supreme
Court decision and that to attack it is
to say that the Supreme Court is anti-
union and anti—democratic.

’’I don't think that's a fair claim to
make about such an institution,” said
Zimmerman.

Wion said, ”Posvar must feel that
if the faculty is permitted to vote, they
will choose to unionize."

Hearings are scheduled with the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board
in November to discuss the univer-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 3, 1986‘

over union issue

sity’s claim that the faculty at Pitt is
barred from organizing under the
Yeshiva Decision.

”Even if we receive a favorable rul-
ing at the hearing, we expect the
university to block action through
legal means,” Wion said.

Posvar could not be reached for
comment.

For a petition to be considered by
the labor board, supporters must file
signed opinion cards from 30 percent
of the faculty.

Wion said, ”We got those cards.
We have at least 30 percent of the
faculty ‘supporting us.

”Unions aren't organized unless
the employees feel that they aren't
being treated fairly,” he continued.

day at 11 

"The role of the faculty in making
decisions is not as effective as it
should be. Collective bargaining
would give the faculty a stronger
position.

”The other consideration is
economic. Faculty across the coun-
try have lost 20 percent of their pur-
chasing power  Pitt faculty have a
long way to go to catch up with that
figure,” he explained.

Wion said that the average salary
for teachers in the Pittsburgh public
schools with a master's degree was
more than the average associate pro-
fessor at Pitt. ”We don't begrudge the
public school teachers their salaries
— they've earned them. We're trying
to get the Pitt faculty the salaries they
deserve.”

If you are planning to spend more than $849
on a stereo system, make sure it sounds
better than this one!

If you have been running all over town
looking and listening to stereo systems, you
may have decided that the only really
satisfying ones cost $2000 or more. Visit us
at opus one and hear an amazing system
that we have designed to equal or outperform
these $2000 systems.

These $2000 systems were put together
by nice people with good intentions.Our $849
system was designed by people whose
intentions are j_ust as good, butwhose
knowledge of sound is much greater.

This knowledge was not brought to us by
the tooth fairy, but earned from 26 years of
hard work. The staff of opus one has
installed more sound systems, recorded
more live musical performances, and
repaired more components than all the other
Pittsburgh hifi stores combined. The opus
one staff has learned what is important for.
good sound and what is not.

We have carefully analyzed why our
expensive systems sound so very good.
These expensive systems have very wide
frequency and dynamic range, great clarity,
and a natural balanced sound. After
listening to and testing hundreds of medium
cost components, we have selected only

_those that come closest to the sound quality
found in our finest systems. Changing even

one of these components could substantially
reduce the quality of the system.

We have based our system around the
Boston A100 loudspeaker developed by
Andy Petite. He is the co-designer of the
original Large Advent which became the
world's largest selling speaker; We know of
no speaker at twice the price that has such
wide frequency range, particular its very
deep bass.

If the Boston A1003 are to reproduce the
deep bass, the amplifier driving them must
have the ability to supply that deep bass.
We recommend the new Kenwood
KRV-55R-Remote controlled AM-FM

‘stereo receiver as the clearest sounding,
receiver in its price class with enough power
to satisfy both you and the Bostons. It
delivers 55 watts RMS power into each
Boston A100 with less than

0.008% total harmonic distortion from
20-20,000 Hz. This is enough clear power to
play two large rooms of speakers. The
KRV-55R has a very sensitive FM tuner that
can bring in even distant stations.

We recommend the precision Dual 1258
belt-driven automatic turntable. The 1258
features a very gentle free moving tone arm
which correctly handles the record -
preserving excellent-sounding Sonus
Black magnetic cartridge. This

combination performs much betterthan most

of the new direct drive, linear tracking
turntables. V

Priced individually the components sell for
$1050. Our system price includes a
dust-cover and all connecting cables. Our
service department with its 26 years of
experience has the capability of fulfilling the
manufacturers warranties.

This system has the power and dynamic
range to handle the new CD disks. If you
would like to add a great sounding and well
constructed CD player to this system, we
strongly recommend the Teac_ PD-200
Compact Disk player. It regularly sells for
$470, but a special purchase has let us offer
this on sale for $249. Supplies on the Teac
PD-200 are limited.

It's that time of year again.

The leaves are starting to turn
brown. The crack of pads can be
heard in Pitt Stadium. Students are

‘pouring into the campus, bringing
with them all the comforts of home:
stereos, typewriters, musical in-
struments, television sets and com-
puters.

Many students are eagerly an-
ticipating the start of another school
year. And so are many thieves.

But there is an organization that is
helping students take a bite out of
crime: The Society of Chartered Prop-
erty and Casualty Underwriters.

CPCU is based in Malvern, Pa.,

and has been helping people fight
crime since 1944. CPCU spokesman
John Woerth describes the organiza-
tion as ”wanting to educate the
public as to ways to help prevent
crime.”

According to Woerth, college
students can be particularly
vulnerable because they'll ”go out for
a bit and just leave stereos, etc., sit-

ting in the window where thieves

have an easy crack at them.”
Woerth said there are a number of

steps students can take to help pro-
tect their valuables, the most impor-
tant being ”Operation ID,’’ a national
anti-theft program.

The program works like this:
Students engrave personal belong-
ings with an ID number, go to the

local police department and fill out
some forms to register the property.
Woerth said police departments
across the country are participating
in the program. '

Woerth said thieves don't like to
take things engraved with identifica-
tion numbers because they are out for
a quick sale, and buyers are usually
wary of items with lD numbers.

Another tip for students is always
lock your door, even if you are just
going to be out of your room for a
minute. It's easy for a professional to
walk in, take money or jewelry and
be gone in seconds.

Also, students should not store
money in obvious places, such as
desk drawers, or leave jewelry on top
of furniture. Avoid telling friends
where money is hidden. Woerth sairl

.Crime aserious concern ofstudents

in most cases the criminal and the
victim know each other.

It's often easy for criminals to know
when college students are on vaca-
tion and break in during this time.
Woerth said first floor rooms are par-
ticularly vulnerable, and students
should be especially careful to close
curtains, lock windows and put
valuable equipment, such as stereos,
in the closet or under the bed.

Many students advertise for rides,
rugs, books, etc. Woerth suggests on-
ly to list your first name and phone
number when advertising for such
things. Do not list a room number.
The more information about what's
in your room and when you won't be
there, the easier it is for thieves to
strike.

Eating
disorders
avoidable

Editor's Note: The following arti-
cle was written by a member of the
Pittsburgh Education Network for
Eating Disorders who wishes to re-
main anonymous.

Eating disorders have reached
epidemic proportions in today's
society, especially the college
population. These disorders cause a
great deal of pain, both emotionally
and physically, for the sufferers. By
sharing one’s concerns and feelings
with others who have had similar ex-
periences, he or shecan discover
ways to make positive changes in his
or her life and to break out of the trap
these disorders can create.

Laura sits in her dormitory room,
staring out her opened window,
watching the people outside throw-
ing a Frisbee. It is two o'clock in the
afternoon. She has been studying
since eight in the morning. She is
alone. Her roommate spends little
time in the room. It seems she always
has something better to do than
study. Laura turns her attention to her
textbook, but once again, she cannot
concentrate. She thinks maybe she is
distracted by the playful noises out-
side. As she gets up to close the win-
dow, she hears the familiar rumble
and repeats to herself, ”l am not
hungry  I am not hungry .  ”
Maybe exercise will help her con-
centrate.

After riding her bike for as long as
she can, Laura returns to her empty
dorm room. She goes to the back of
her closet and takes out her newest
friend, the bathroom scale. She
cheers -105! Laura hears a noise at

. the door and hurriedly puts the scale

back to its hiding place. It's her room-
mate, Pam, who's come to ask her to
go with her to the cafeteria for din-
ner. Laura tenses up in an effort to
sound convincing and replies, ”No
thanks Pam, I just ate.”

If this story sounds familiar to you,
you or someone you know may be
suffering from an eating disorder. The
Student Health Service, the Health
Education Office and the community-
based organization Pittsburgh Educa-
tion Network for Eating Disorders co-
sponsor a support group which meets
weekly. Group members recognize
that they have an unhealthy attitude
concerning food. Many are dissatis-
fied with their body image and have
a poor self-concept. Some group
members have suffered from anorex-
ia, bulimia or compulsive overeating
for a number of years before" joining
the support group. The group offers
a safe environment to discuss the
underlying problems which con-
tribute to these disorders, while
alleviating the feelings of alienation
common among sufferers.

’’I felt so alone until I found the
group,” said one group member. ”At

' first I was afraid to talk, but they never

pressured me to contribute if I didn't

. want to. Just sitting there and having

someone else express what I was
feeling was a great comfort.”

The group is scheduled to meet
Sept.‘l7 at 1 p.m. in Room 624 of
the William Pitt Union.

Brutus joins faculty  

Dennis Brutus, South African affairs
expert and internationally recognized
poet and writer, has been named
chairman of Pitt's Department of
Black Community Education Re-
search and Development.

Brutus plans to develop and ex-
pand the strengths of the department,
specifically literature and politics.

According to Brutus, the depart-
ment plans to host several sym-
posiums involving African writers. In
1988, it will host the 13th Annual
Conference of the African Literature
Association.

”The conference .will be a major
event,” Brutus said. ”Some 250
African writers and scholars will be
in attendance.”

Brutus will structure the depart-
ment’s literature program around the
writers attending the conference.

”We have plans now to focus the

\ study of the department on the

QT.-—jQmgmQm.mgmQmOmOmO

writers that will be at the con-
ference,” Brutus said. ”We will con-
centrate on their works and will be
doing research on those writers
throughout the term.”

Also, Brutus is planning a series of
symposiums on post-apartheid South
Africa. The first will take place this
fall and will include experts from the
Pittsburgh area and from around
Pennsylvania. A major symposium is
still in the works. Brutus expects

‘ many prestigious speakers to attend

the svmposium.

”We expect Senator John Heinz to
attend,” Brutus said. ”And possibly
such others as Bishop Tutu and Gavin
Relly who is the chairman of the
largest corporation in South Africa.

”We hope to involve both the
political and corporate communities
in this symposium, although the sym-
posiums are still in the planning stage
and none of the names are definite.”

 SGB increases involvement in allocations

.-... .

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

When you receive your tuition in-
voice for the fall term, you'll notice
that there is a particular item marked
”activities fee." Upon payment of
this fee, you are entitled to take ad-
vantage of various campus activities
and programs. After all students have
payed the fee, it amounts to about
$300,000. This money goes to the
Student Government Board, which in
turn, allocates it back to you.

The SGB is responsible for the
distribution of funds to various stu-
dent organizations on campus. They
also represent the student body to the
administration and faculty. Jim Mum-
ma, president of the SGB, said
another important function ' is to
’’simply look at problems or concerns
students have and to do what we can
to rectify those.”

President Pro Tempore Amy Unks
said that the SGB at Pitt is very in-

volved in the allocation process. ”We
basically run that [allocation] more
than a lot of student governments
do,” she said.

Mumma agreed, saying that he
believed that compared to other
universities, the SGB allocation pro-
cess at Pitt is probably the best in the
country.

Because students are paying the
fee, it is important that the money is
allocated properly.

”|t’s very beneficial that we have
students allocating that money to stu-
dent groups instead of administrators
[allocating the moneyl/' Mumma
said.

According to Mumma, the SGB is
the most important campus organiza-
tion. ”They’re accountable to us.
They represent only small parts of the
university whereas we represent
every undergraduate student,” he
continued. 0

The board consists of a president
and eight board members, which is
one reason why it is ”more concen-
trated and centralized,” said Mum-

ma.”lt helps us to come together on
issues. A lot of large campuses have
senates and they just spend the en-
tire year arguing,” he said.

This fall, the SGB in conjunction
with CGS student government and
Pitt graduate schools’ student govern-
ment, will choose student members
for the board of trustees. This selec-
tion takes place every four years.

A first for the board this fall is the
formation of an advisory committee
to the board of trustees on divestment
from South Africa that Mumma will
sit on. A decision is expected from
the board in October.

”Student Government has called

ment, and this year is the first time

anything. We have a resolution for
them in committee,” Mumma said.

He said that overall, the SGB has
become increasingly involved in im-
portant issues. Unks said that the ad-
ministration is very cooperative. ”The
administration makes it a point to in-
volve us in most of their decisions,
more than most people would think.
They need us basically for our view-
point,” she said.

The SGB consists of six standing
committees. The judicial board and
elections committee will have posi-
tions open in the fall, according to
Mumma. The student relations com-
mittee, which does publicity for the
SGB and the governmental relations
committee, a group that lobbies for
student issues in Harrisburg, are
always open for membership. A stu-
dent can become a member of the
allocations committee by interview.
There is also an affirmative action
committee, which welcomes all in-
terested members.

Upstage has New Yorkstyle

By Christopher Capra

When examining Oakland's ”par-
ty district” — those bars which dot
the streets of the campus and its sur-
roundings — one should check into
The Upstage Lounge at 3609 Forbes
Ave. near Atwood Street and Meyran
Avenue.

The Upstage features good drinks
at good prices, great music and danc-
ing on its ”new wave" nights (Mon-
days, Wednesdays and Saturdays). It
is closed on Tuesdays.

The Upstage is a rare find in the

they also have a wide choice of fresh

means conservative, and the place is
too loud and fast to be a ”meat

Today, the times aren't so rich for
The Decade. An example is their
cover charge of $5 to see Norm Nar-
dini and $3 for Joey G. It's just not
the same anymore.

But, looking at The Decade from
the standpoint of the present, and not
the past, it could be thought of as in-
teresting — sort of like a museum.
There are lots of interesting artifacts
and specials. For instance, Tuesday
night is Ladies’ Night with free admis-
sion for all females. Wednesday is
Iron City night, when all Iron City
products are reduced in price: $1 for
Iron City and |.C Light, and $1 .50 for
l.C. Coolers. Last, but not least, is
Thursday which is beer blast night
featuring no cover and 50 cent drafts.

The Decade may be a nice place
to go and see your favorite national-
ly obscure band, or simply to
reminisce about the '70s. But guys,
it's no place to take a girl, especially
if you want to impress her.

   

   

Caleco’s; casual,

By Christopher Capra
Staff Writer

A bar which’ features more specials
than any other in the area is Caleco’s
on Oakland Avenue near Forbes.

Of all the bars I attended, Caleco’s

offered more than any of the others-

in specials almost every night.

The week begins with Genesee
happy hour from 4-7 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Drafts and pitchers of
Genesee products are 50 cents and
$2.50 respectively. Wednesday is
Molson night when glasses of cold
Molson on draft are only 50 cents
and pitchers are only $3 from 8 p.m.

Caleco’s offers a D.J. Tuesday
through Saturday nights, with Tues-
day night being oldies night. Planned
for the fall are I.C. Golden Lager
nights, and Y97-FM nights with many
specials to be offered.

The ‘ atmosphere at Caleco’s is
usually crowded and loud. It's a far
cry from the bar that used to occupy
the same building — Danny's Pub
which didn't really bring in the
crowds that the new renters do.

Caleco’s is a reasonably priced,
typical college campus bar with no
cover charge. It is closed on Sundays
and positive l.D. is required.

freshmen are having to adjust to the
routine -of living with a roommate
and, in many cases, a personthey
have never met before. ’’I feel like it'll
be hard to live with a new person and
having to share the way roommates
must,” said Harkness. Tanya Shef-
field, a new acquaintance of
Harkness’, said, ’’I used to share a
room with my brother, so a room-
mate is no big deal.”

Freshmen David Agale also said

that sharing a room was no big deal.
”lt’s really not that much ofa change
for me,” said Agale, ”because I
shared a room with my brother too.”
Agale said that the ‘orientation was
useful although he ”thought the men-
tor meetings were the worst.”
Harkness, Sheffield and Agale ex-
pressed various opinions on the
orientation events that brought them
together. And like most freshmen
they felt that it served its purpose in
allowing them to meet other students.

THE PITT NEWS

Ferguson out for at least one semester

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball team was stung
by the announcement yesterday that
junior forward Marlon Ferguson is in-
eligible for the fall semester and
could possibly be out for the entire
season. ‘

Ferguson, who sat out last season
with a medical redshirt, was expected
to battle with Tico Cooper for a start-
ing position at the power forward
post, if 6-10 junior Charles Smith is
indeed moved to center.

Ferguson's absence, coupled with
the ineligibility of four of five Pitt

There was. something eerily
familiar about Monday night's loss to
Maryland. There was Mark Brasco

face at least, costing Pitt the ballgarne. r

The time for a change is now. Not

now. Mark Brasco has to be replac-
ed as the Pitt placekicker.

The record speaks for itself.

recruits, leaves new coach Paul Evans
with only nine scholarship players for
the upcoming year.

The latest recruit to be ruled ineligi-
ble is Jimmy Rodgers, a 6-1 point
guard from Brunswick Junior College
in Georgia. Rodgers, who was ex-
pected to challenge for the starting
spot at point guard along with

’ sophomore Mike Goodson, failed to

meet his junior college requirements
and will not enroll at Pitt.

Rodgers is the fourth of the Pan-
thers’ five basketball recruits who will
not be playing at Pitt this season.

guidelines of Proposition 48.

Under Proposition 48, a high
school senior must score at least 700
on the SAT and maintain a minimum
2.0 grade point average in a core of

11 academic subjects. If these stan-
dards are not met, an athlete on
scholarship is ineligible for athletic
competition his or her freshman year.

want to lose a year of eligibility, so

able to compete for the Buckeyes this
season because he is paying his own
tuition and is not on athletic
scholarship.

McNeil, a native of Wilson, N.‘C.,
will enroll at Allegany Community
College in Cumberland, Md.

Gatling, a teammate ot Goodson at
Elizabeth High School in New Jersey,
will enroll at Pitt even though he is
ineligible.

Pitt's fifth recruit, Rodney Brookin,

a 6-5 forward from Stee'lton,—Pa., met
the eligibility requirements and,

But there were differences. The
times a-re a changin’ at Pitt Stadium.
Last year's leading rusher, Charles
Gladman, was held to 24 yards on
only 10 carries, and ”|ronhead”
Héyward proved to be a better
receiver than running back against

' the Terps. The most striking change,
= however, was Pitt's offensive
' _, philosophy.

Foge Fazio, a defensive-minded

 coach from the day he was born, was
1 content to let the run set up the pass.

With Mike Gottfried, the opposite is

.9 ‘true. Gottfried promised Pitt fans an
o ‘offense as wide-open as the Kansas

prairie, and Monday night he
delivered.

John Congemi had one of his most
outstanding games, throwing for 258

A » yards on 45 attempts. Congemi com-

pleted 23 of those throws, including

: a nifty 32 yard touchdown throw to
Reggie Williams. Significantly, Con-
‘V gemi threw no interceptions against

a strong Maryland defensive

backfield.

’’I thought I did alright,” said a
weary Congemi after the game. ”But

I . the bottom line is we didn't win. We
"should have put them away early.

We had a lot of chances. It's

7' a frustrating because we dominated."

Congemi added that the Maryland

 ..defense was as good as the reputa-

tion that preceded them, ”but in the

 same breath I always felt in control.”

‘Besides an increased reliance on
the passing game, another difference

. in the Pitt offense Monday night was

”One thing about our offense is
that we already have a lot of it in,”
said Brown. ”We have a lot of dif-
ferent areas to cover. We have a lot
of plays and a lot of formations, and

we do what we have to do to adjust
to whatever defense we're playing.”

Brown, whose rushing high was a

got the ball so often. ”Yeah, I was sur-
prised, but I got the ball early a few

times and it worked. I don't think
Coach Gottfried is going to be
stereotyped. He'll go with whatever’s
working.”

Ironically, in what was one of Pitt's
better offensive performances, Gott-
fried never let the offense go for it on
a fourth down and short play.

In the first quarter, Gottfried elected
to try a field goal on a fourth and one
at the Maryland 24. The kick was
wide right. In the second quarter,
John Rasp was called in to punt on
a fourth and two at the Maryland 38.
Later in that quarter Gottfried again
let Brasco kick on a fourth and four
from the Maryland 12. Again the kick
was wide right.

Gottfried said he would ”come
back tomorrow and assess [the kick-
ing situation] then.” The rookie
coach defended his punting call
because Pitt had good field position
and did not want to lose it, and he
thought perhaps a punt could pin
Maryland deep in their own territory.
Gottfried was right on that count.
Steve Apke downed the ball on the
Pitt seven yard line.

Despite the excellent field position
Pitt enjoyed nearly all night, the Pan-
thers simply could not score when
they had to. Maryland did, and that
was the difference in the ballgame.

We missed a lot of scoring oppor-
tunities,” Gottfried said. ”We just
didn't get it done. You have to give
Maryland a lot of credit. They took
the ball and moved it-down on us

and had a chance for a ﬁeld goal, and

the kid made it.”

The drive Gottfried was alluding to
was the most crucial series of the
game. Pitt finally put together a
touchdown drive midway through
the fourth quarter to make the score

7-6. Rarely has there been as much‘

pressure on a college kicker to make
an extra pointas there was on Brasco
then. Brasco’s kick was true and the

Panthers tied the score with only five
minutes and 12 seconds left in the
game. '

Pat Viancourt’s kickoff was short.
Keeta Covington took it at the sixteen
and returned the ball 20 yards to the
the Maryland 36. j _

On the first play from scrimmage,
Maryland quarterback Dan Henning

' gave the ball to running back Tom-

my Neal. Neal broke left and broke
2 tackles behind the line of scrim-
mage on his way to a 14 yard gain.
From there, Henning & Co. picked
apart the Pitt defense that had stifled
them all night. The Maryland drive
didn't run out of gas until the Pitt 11
yard line.

On a fourth and seven, Maryland
kicker Dan Plocki came in for a field
goal. The 29 yard attempt was
perfect, and Maryland had the lead
for good.

It seems a mystery as to why
Maryland was so successful on their

’ final drive when they had been

stymied there before.

”We stayed in our regular
coverage," Pitt defensive back Quin-
tin Jones said of the defensive scheme
on Maryland's field goal drive.

The Panthers have this week off,
then travel to N .C. State on Sept. 13.
Pitt will have a long time time to let
this game eat -at their confidence.

”We just need to get a win under
our belts,” Gottfried said. ”You’ve
got to find ways to win. I told the
team after the game that now they'll
face some real adversity early in the
year. I still think we have a chance
tohave a prettygood team. No one
game makes or.breaks a ‘year. We'll
just have to be a better team from this
game.”

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 3, I986

 

 

Brasco

continued from page l7

ted, 11 field goals made with 35 per-
cent accuracy. There were 4 games
in which Mark Brasco contributed to
three Pitt losses and one tie.

It is time for a change. Brasco has
had more than his share of oppor-
tunities to prove himself and has fail-
ed in every attempt. The high school
All-America from Jeanette has been,
to say the least, a major disappoint-
ment in a Panther uniform.

Yet he cannot be blamed solely for
the four games Pitt lost or tied in
which he missed field-goal attempts.
In my opinion, if you depend on your
kicker to win games for you, you're
in trouble." Good teams don't depend
on placekickers.

All I am saying is that he should
have all the pressure, which he hasn't
handled very well, removed from his
shoulders. Burden someone else with
the task of doing the placekicking.

Every fall camp at Edinboro Univer-
sity Brasco has kicked like he is All-
World. He has shown tremendous
accuracy and a strong leg, making
successful attempts of 50-55 yards
with room to spare.

But that is fall camp. The stands are

empty and the critics few. Most im-
portantly, the statistics are mean-
ingless. That is where Brasco excels.
Yet, when he performs in a regular
season game with 50,000 fans wat-
ching he can not do the job.

Jeff Van Horne, Pitt's freshmen
kicker from Cheney, Wash., is an im-
pressive kicker. Despite being clear-
ly out dueled by Brasco at camp, he
has shown a lot of promise. Natural-
ly he doesn't have the experience
Brasco has, but he does possess one

trait which Brasco lacks -— con-

. fidence. Van Home has yet to kick

in a collegiate game. Until he does,
he will not have to endure the men-
tal hardships of kicking for a
mediocre major college team that

. depends entirely too much on its

kicker to win games.

‘ Brasco doesn't-have any problems
physically, just mentally. His mind is
frazzled. Every time he goes out to
kick he thinks about all the misses,
all the pressure. Simply stated, when
Mark Brasco goes out to kick a field
goal he just doesn't have confidence
that he's going to put the ball through

the goal post. -

Surprisingly, his teammates
disagree. ”Mark seemed relaxed to
me. I thought he was ready to go,”
said Van Horne. ”Fundamental|y, he
wasn't doing anything wrong.”

Brasco’s holder on field goals,

quarterback John Congemi, offered
similar sentiments. "Mark was doing
the same things that he had been do-
ing in practice," said Congemi. "He
just didn't kick well tonight.”

That is the problem. There is
nothing that indicates Brasco will
kick well in any other game this year.

Now, it is time for a change. Get
the monkey off Brasco’s back. Let Jeff
Van Horne kick. Pitt has suffered
through two consecutive disappoint-
ing seasons, and they are off on the
wrong foot, no pun intended, in this,
their most important season ever. The
fans are looking for a scapegoat, and
Brasco has been it. When a team's
kicker ‘is the main target of the fan's
wrath,’ something is wrong.

Mike Gottfried should do Brasco a
favor and bench him. The kid just
can't handle the pressure and, from
all indications, he never will. ,

Notes from a disappointing 10-7
loss to the Maryland Terrapins:

0 For those of you who thought this
was Mike Gottfried’s first loss ever at
Pitt Stadium, you are wrong. Gott-
fried was the head man at Cincinnati
in 1981 when the Panthers trounced

. ' . the Bearcats 38-7.

0 Taking all factors into considera-
tion, the attendance (48,120) was im-

, pressive. With the TV coverage of the

game and the Labor Day holiday, Pitt

I officials couldn't ask for a bigger

crowd.

I The game was such a defensive
battle that Maryland's kicker, Dan
Plocki, was named the ESPN-
Hartford Insurance Player of the
Game. Plocki, a North Allegheny
graduate, kicked the game winning
field goal with two minutes re-
maining.

6 0 Maryland defensive back Lewis

Askew, a Gateway High School,
graduate, had four tackles for the Ter- ’

rapins. Arnold Walker, Maryland's
freshman running back from Con-
nellsville, Pa., is ineligible under the
rules of Proposition 48.

North Carolina State for a night game.
The Panthers defeated the Wolfpack
24-10 at Pitt Stadium last season.

0 Tailback Charles Gladman had a
disappointing night running the ball,
but he still moved up in the Pitt
record books. Gladman’s 27 yards
rushing moved him ahead of Freddy
Jacobs, with 1,637 yards, and into
10th place on the Panther all-time
rushing list. '

0 A bright note for the Panthers
was that they didn't suffer any major
injuries in the contest. The most
notable injuries were: running back
Tom Brown (strained knee), defen-
sive back Quintin Jones (leg cramps),
Gladman (shoulder), and Tony
Woods (pulled groin).

0 The loss was the Pautners’ third
straight defeat at home. It also
marked only the third opening game
loss for Pitt in the last 13 years.

0 Craig Heyward’s return to the
college gridiron was rather unevent-
ful. ”lronhead” rushed one time for
10 yards and caught three passes for
24 yards in limited playing time.

0 Defensively the Panthers had a.

few stellar performances. Defensive
tackle Lorenzo Freeman had a good

game, recording five tackles (one for
a seven yard loss), one sack and a
fumble recovery. Linebackers Jerry
Olsavsky and Zeke Gadson played
well. Olsavsky led Pitt with 11
tackles, while Gadson, a converted
running back, added six tackles and
a sack.

0 Despite the loss, Pitt had the
edge in most of the statistical
categories. The Panthers bested the
Terrapins in first downs (20-17), yards
passing (258-166), total yards
(347-257) and time of possession
(32:20-27:40).

0 The game was marked by con-
troversy in the third quarter when
Charles Gladman caught a 32-yard
pass from Congemi, but then ap-
parently fumbled and Maryland
recovered. The officials then decid-
ed he was down at the ‘time of the
fumble and gave the ball to Pitt. But
another official overruled and
Maryland got the ball back.

The Terrapins marched 54 yards in
nine plays, scoring on a one-yard TD
run by Tommy Neal. Gottfried still
doesn't understand the reversal of the
decision on G|adman’s fumble. ’’All
they explained to me was that a guy
made the call and was overruled by
another official. So they changed the
call,’’ he said.

team,” linebacker Chuck Faucette
said after the game. ”This is very
satisfying.”

Maryland used a very tough
defense and a shaky offense to eke
out a win in a game most observers
probably think they should have lost.
Pitt owned thefirst half, but when the
money was on the table late in the
game, it was Maryland, not Pitt, who

believed to have been caused by a
heart attack, it was later learned that
' Bias died due to cocaine intoxication.

the entire Maryland campus, as
allegations rranging from player
payoffs to grade fixing to a drug
T epidemic among athletes to possible
A criminal charges against the school's
basketball coach.
It will be a long time before

. the Maryland football team took the
first steps toward that time.
’’It was a great win for the whole

rose to the occasion.

”We knew it would be a very
tough, physical game,” Maryland
coach Bobby Ross said. ”We ex-
pected it, and we knew a win would
have a great deal of meaning for our
football team. The big thing is that it
helps us confidence-wise.”

The Maryland offense was placed
in the inexperienced hands of Dan
Henning, who had never before
played in a college game.

’’I don't think he was tentative at
all,” Ross said of Henning. ”He just
had to get a feel for things. We had ’

Pitt prepares: A week with the Panthers

By Jim U rban
Editor-in-Chief

What does it take to prepare a team
for a home opener? For Pitt it took a
lot of sweat, a lot of running and a
lot of practice. This past week, the
Panthers prepared for Maryland at
Pitt Stadium. The Pitt News was
there.

Tuesday, Aug. 26 —- six days till
Maryland —- Less than a week re-
mains before Maryland comes into
town, and Pitt has begun to refine
what it instilled during camp.

Today’s workout went smoothly
until late in practice when freshman
punter John Rasp slightly sprained his
left ankle. The accident occurred dur-
ing a live punting drill where the first
punting team was working against
the scout team.

Rasp got the punt off but was
subsequently knocked down by
several players including freshman
linebacker Chris Jackson. Gottfried
did something he doesn't do very
often to the scout team — he raised
his voice. He stressed the fact that
knocking down and injuring the start-
ing punter does not do the team

much good.

After practice, Gottfried sat down
with Jackson in the bleachers at Pitt
Stadium where. they calmly and
quietly discussed the incident.

’’It is a mild sprain,” Gottfried said
after practice of Rasp’s injury. ”He
should be back soon.” Gottfried
stressed that the battle between Rasp
and Scott Merlack would continue.
”We’l| have to see how Rasp comes
back from the sprain,” Gottfried said.

Rasp, a freshman from Norwin,
seemed to fall behind early but late-
ly had pulled ahead in the punting
race. Merlack finished practice work-
ing with the first team and seemed
unshaken by the injury to Rasp.

”John’s been kicking good,”
Merlack said. ”He had a shaky start
but came on strong of late. I am just
trying to get my rhythm established
again. I hope both of us do good, but
only one can play.”

For most of the practice, John Con-
gemi worked with the first team of-
fense. Gottfried had the unit work on
the regular offense for 35 minutes
and then worked on the offense in-
side the 20-yard line for the final 25
minutes of practice.

The receivers, especially junior
Mike Stewart, looked good, but there
were some problems. Charles Glad-
man dropped two passes out of the
backfield before finally pulling one
in. Starting tight end Vernon Kirk also
dropped one. Is this a sign of things
to come?

When the Panthers worked on
their goal-line offense, the unit went
with two fullbacks, Tom Brown and
Matt LaVigna, with Charles Gladman
at tailback. Brown lined up as a U-
back, behind the right tackle, and
Gladman and LaVigna were in the I-
formation. Two plays seemed to
come out of this formation — either
Gladman up the middle or Congemi
around the right end.

Fullback Craig Heyward, who
reported to fall camp almost 30
pounds overweight, would not reveal
his current weight but said he and Pitt
assistant strength coach Ray Oliver
have a bet as to whether or not
Heyward can get down to his play-
ing weight before the Maryland
game.

.  i fens’e into the game.”

One luxury Henning had to help
him through his first game was run-
ning back Alvin Blount.

Blount, a certain All-ACC selection

‘A in 1986 led all rushers with 66 yards.

Of those, 39 came in the second

5 half. Blount, like the rest of the
" Maryland offense, was shut down

during the first half.

”We' ‘just did more the second
half,” Blount said, explaining the dif-
ference in Maryland's performance.

A strong defense and Pitt's missed

' field goals kept Maryland in the

game, but Blount doesn't see that
happening all year.

”The defense kept us in it,” he said.
”But in the second half we got on
track. I think the first few games will
be like this until the offense gets more

. experienced. We had no games ex-

perience at quarterback and only a
few games on the ,offe_nsive line. So
I think it will take a few games until
we get it all together.”

There is no , question that the

Maryland defense has it all together.
They are led by All-ACC defensive
back Keeta Covington and All-
America candidate Chuck Faucette.

”I think our defense did an
outstanding job of keeping us in the
ball game the first half," Ross said.
”I came off the field at the beginning
of the second half and heard they had
the ball something like 22 minutes to
our eight, and I had not realized it
was that long. I thought our defense
did a great job, and all we had to do
was get our offense in gear so we
could take the pressure off our
defense.”

Faucette, tied for the Maryland
high with nine tackles, agreed with
his coach.

"I think what you saw tonightis
pretty much the way the year will go.
I think the offense showed tonight
they are capable of winning.

”This win will help our confidence
tremendously. It was a great win.”

For Faucette, the key to Maryland's
defensive success was the pressure
put on Congemi.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 3, I986

Wednesday, Aug. 27, 1986 — five
days till Maryland — Heyward said
his weight has stabilized. ’’I look skin-
ny  too skinny at that,” Heyward
said.

Word has it that he is tipping the
scales at around 258 pounds — 13
pounds ovenNeight. Still, it looks as
if he will see some limited action at
tailback if Gladman needs a rest.

Rasp did not practice today
because he is in the hospital with a
mild concussion. Gottfried said that
will not affect the punting race in any
way. He still expects Rasp to be back
by Monday for the Maryland game,
and either he or Merlack will punt.

Thursday, Aug. 28, 1986 — four
days till Maryland — Starting quarter-
back John Congemi looked sharp to-
day. Now all he has to do is get some
receivers that will hold on to the ball.
Kirk and Gladman both dropped
passes again today, but Gottfried said
he is not worried.

”I think a lot of these dropped

fried said. ’’It has been a long camp,
and we are going to start shortening
the practices so the guys can get their

The team donned its game
uniforms today and the coaches tried
out headsets for the first time. The
squad worked through a lot of game
situations, with the coaches signaling
in plays from the sidelines. A 30-sec-
ond clock was even used as well as
a referee.

Gottfried did not have much to say
after practice, but it was obvious he
was not happy. Still, he would not
call the practice session -a complete
loss.

”I don't know if there is ever a
horrible practice,” Gottfried said.

Friday, Aug. 29, 1986 4 three
days till Maryland — As the days get
closer, the smiles get scarcer on the
practice field at Pitt Stadium. ”This
is very serious,” Gottfried said with
a straight face.

Posvar and Dr. Ed Bozik — showed
up at practice today had something
to do with it. Gottfried said Posvar
spoke briefly to the squad.

The Panthers, meanwhile, would
not feel their pads until Monday night
against Maryland. They practiced in
sweats today, and Gottfried said they
will remain in sweats for the re-
mainder of the practices. As promised
yesterday, the practice session was
shortened. ,

Elsewhere, the early signs of Musco
— the company that will illuminate
Pitt Stadium on Monday — began to
surface. Large trucks moved into the
stadium area, and with them, securi-
ty guards to guard against vandalism.

Saturday, Aug. 30, 1986 — two
days until Maryland — Rasp punted
well today, and it is quite evident that
he will handle the chores on Mon-
day. Pitt worked on the little things
today, such as onside kicks and kick-
ing off after a safety. Gottfried did not
have" much to say after practice as the
serious attitude remained. He was
surprised by one visitor to practice,

however.

The Goodyear blimp appeared
overhead towards the end of practice.
Gottfried said he has never had the
blimp attend one of his practices
before. He has never even had the
blimp attend one of his games before.

Maryland will practice Sunday at
2:30 p.m. ’’If I were them, I would
sure come in a lot later than that,”
Gottfried said, referring to the fact
that the game is not until the follow-
ing Monday night.

The Panthers will spend tonight
and tomorrow night in a hotel.

Sunday, Aug. 31, 1986 — one day
till Maryland — The lights were on
at Pitt Stadium tonight as Pitt con-
ducted the final workout of the
preseason. It was a typical final day
workout, just running through what
the Panthers will try tomorrow night.

Security was tight. Visitors had to
get past two security guards before
they even reached the field. The first
thing Gottfried did when he walked
out of the locker room was to look
around the stadium checking for

possible Maryland spies.

Pitt was in and out quickly. After I ‘
practice, Gottfried walked the field '

checking out the lighting. He said he
was not sure if there were spots

where he could take advantage of a g I I
Maryland defensive back because of _- “- ‘

the glare of the lights, but he would
sure try.

All that was left now was to play _ 

the game.
Monday, Sept. 1, 1986 —- What is
weird when looking back at the past

week is that some of the questionable _ I
areas came through for Pitt. For ex-

ample, Gladman, who dropped

several passes during the week, turn- . .3 

ed out to be the Panthers’ leading "V

receiver against Maryland. He caught 

six passes for 78 yards.

THE PITT l_\lEWS, Wednesday,-September 3, W86

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt women's basketball coach Kirk
Bruce lost his two assistant coaches

 this past summer, but he wasted no
time in finding replacements.

A Carol Dugan, an assistant the past

~ four seasons at Pitt, left to take a

similar job at Virginia Tech.
Dugan, herself a former Lady Pan-

T ther hoopster, had a great relation-

res women's basketball coaches

ship with Bruce and the players,
making her departure quite a disap-
pointment.

”All the girls were upset, but they
understand,” commented Bruce. ’‘It
was a tough decision for Carol. But
when you resign yourself to the fact
that you want to coach basketball,
especially as an assistant, you can't
stagger in one place. So it was an im-
portant career move-for her.”

The same can be said for part-time
assistant Wavne Williams, who

resigned to devote more time to his
insurance sales job. .-

”The girls got along well with
Wayne,” said Bruce. ”The problem
was that his regular job was killing
him. It was interfering with his work
here at times. I talked with him about
it and he felt it would be best to pur-
sue only one occupation.”

Williams, a former starting point
guard on the Pitt men's team, spent
only one year as a Lady Panther
assistant.

With Dugan and Williams gone,
Bruce had to act quickly to find
replacements. And he did, as Kim
Basick and John LeMiuex were
recently hired to fill the posts.

Basick, an assistant at Robert Mor-
ris the past three seasons, is a top
quality coach and a good addition for
Pitt. ”Kim knows the talent around
Pennsylvania as well as anyone,”
said Bruce. ”She’s a good recruiter.
I also think she will do well handl-

_ ing some administrative duties for us.

7. Posters that are written in a foreign language must include an English translation.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

All around, Kim's a good coach.”
LeMiuex, a former Kent State assis-
tant, was not contacted by Pitt about
the open coaching position, rather,
he submitted a resume. Bruce was
impressed and hired LeMiuex.

Bruce is not very familiar with
LeMiuex, but yet he has no doubts
abotlt his new assistant’s coaching
abilities. ”l met John at last year's
women's Final Four in Lexington,”
said Bruce. ’’And I'm very confident
that he will do a fine job for us at
Pitt.”

Bruce, entering his second season
as Lady Panther head coach, feels the
loss of Dugan and Williams will not
affect his team's morale. ”The girls
are all mature,” added Bruce. ”They
know these things happen. As long
as they know that I'm here and that
I'm not leaving, they'll be alright.”

LADY PANTHER NOTES: Bruce
said that Lori Johnson, Pitt's star
recruit from New Castle High School,
had surgery on her injured knee this
summer. She is out of the cast and
doing fine, but will be redshirted this
season. What could be a problem for
Johnson is Proposition 48, the
eligibility guidelines for freshmen
athletes. Johnson scored above the
required minimum on the ACT, but
apparently there is a discrepancy with
a math course she tookat New Cas-
tle. Pitt is still reviewing the situation
at this moment. If there is an un-
favorable ruling in Johnson's case,
then she would have to sit out the
1987-88 season because, athletical-
ly, that would be her freshman year,
due to the fact she is taking a medical
redshirt this season. Pitt's two other
freshmen, Jenny Schingler and Karen
Threatt, met the eligibility re-
quirements.
