By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer
After two alleged "sexual assaults
and several intrusions by a male
prowler into’ female shower rooms

in Lothrop Hall, residents‘ there.»

have demanded that security be
tightened in the dormitory. . ‘
’ After a man entered. a women’s'
shower room late Wednesday night
and then ﬂed when questioned by a
woman taking ‘a shower, residents
organized hallway patrols"to keep a
constant ‘watch, for the prowler,
whom resident ‘assistants’ report
has been seen roamingthe halls

and harrassing ‘female students‘ in \\

showers.

Pitt Police have now assigned a
policeman to guard the building
and an extra person has been
assigned to check IDs before

residents enter Lothrop Hall‘

elevators.

According to Brian Keemer,
Lothrop Hall’s representative to
the Inter-‘Residence’ Board and_the

movement of people

director of the Lothrop Security
Committee, some of the women on
different ‘ﬂoors have organized
buddy systems, and women living
on the 13th floor have posted signs
warning ‘that any unescorted man
will be asked to leave the floor.
Keemer also wants to‘ arrange

permanent ‘changes in Lothrop’s

security’ system to make the

building less accessible. He points‘ .

out that it is now possible tq enter
the p building‘ at ﬁve different
places.

‘Besides the main entrance, two

passages from the Victoria building’ '

to Lothrop are open during ‘part of
the day, according ‘to Keemer.‘ He-
said people can also enter through
the loading ‘ clock, a tunnel from
Presbyterian. Hospital and ‘a street

Congress HandsCarter Victoryin Energyvote

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON —A weary Con-
gress handed Jimmy Carter the
biggest domestic victroy of ‘his
presidency yesterday, approving a
much-changed national enery plan
ﬁrst sent to Capitol Hill 18 month
ago. ~

The 95th Congress sent the White
House a package that critics said
will cost consumers too much and
produce few new energy reserves.

The president praised the
package, saying it “will advance out
national security, ensure our
freedom of action in foreign affairs
and protect our economic interests
at home and abroad.”

Bleary-eyed House members
completed their 231-168 vote for the
enery program at 7:32 a.m. shortly
after dawn broke over the Capitol

‘dome in the‘; midst of an

\

around-the-clock legislative ses-

sion. 1

From 1 beginning to end, the.
legislation stirred bitter contoversy
and its outcome was in doubt almost
until the end,

The ﬁve-part energy package is a
far weaker one than Carter sent to
Congress on April 20, 1977 when he
said the United States’ energy
problems was “the moral equiva-
lent of war.”

A Imulti-billion-dollar tax on
crudeoil, which Carter once termed
the centerpiece of the program, and
a nickel-a-gallon tax on gasoling
were dropped as the measure
worked its way through Congress.

Even‘ its prime backers acknow-
led-gepd shortcomings in the legisla-
 it emerged from a tortuous
series of legislative compromises.

Ngnetheless, the measuremarks

. /

the ﬁrst attempt to overcome widely
divergent. regional and economic
interests ‘and enact a unified policy
to increase energy production and
encourage conservation.

A parallel goal is a reduction of
imported oil. The United States
now uses about 16 million barrels of
oil daily, importing about half that
amount. '

Carter’s energy advisers claim
the energy program approved by

Congress will reduce that by 2.5 "

million barrels daily, improving the
positionof the dollar abroad, and
enhancing confidence in the

American economy among its’

trading partners in Europe and
Japan.’  i
The most‘ ‘heated debate on the
program focused on a plan.that will
zderegulate the price of newly found

1  gas by 1985.

In the meantime, producers are
granted increases over eight years
that will double the prices they can
charge.

While those portions of the
natural gas compromise meet the
wishes of the oil and gasproducers,

,the bill also eliminates a dual
pricing system between producer
and non-producer states.

Supporters said this will elimin-
ate a repeat of wintertime shortages
of natural gas that closed Midwest-
ern and Eastern schools and
factories, two years ago. ‘

The energy tax bill would provide
tax credits up to $300 for Americans
who insulate their homes ‘or install
other weatherizing. equipment.

It would also give a maximum tax
credit of $2,200. for those who install
solar heating or wind _ energy
equipment’.

McWilliams, is , currently drawing 1

" up a constitution for the Penn-

Flaherty, Thomburgh Take Break

Pennsylvania's two major gubernatorial candidates did

' little campaigning yesterday, with one staying home to

In the waning weeks of the election battle that ends in the
polling booths Nov. 7, Democrat Peter F. Flaherty and
Republican Richard L. Thomburgh have criticized each
other’s campaign tactics and political advertisements.

Flaherty accused Thomburgh of running what he called a
“dirty” campaign by trying to discredit his actiions as

The Thornburgh television ads allege that Flaherty raised

Taxes Cut for 65 Million

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Congress

completed action yesterday on an
$18.7 billion bill that would cut
taxes for 65 million couples and
individuals next year, slash the
capital gains tax and.,,gi,v_e a new
break to elderly Americans who sell

- their homes.

The House voted 337-38 to pass
the measure following passage by
the Senate on a 72-3 vote.

The measure .now goes to the

of White House, and a top presidential

aide said. the president would want
to give it careful scrutiny before
deciding whether to sign it.

The Senate, on a 46-29 vote,
defeated a last-minute attempt to
revive a provision that would have
cut taxes an additional $164.5

‘ billion in 1980 through 1983 if

government spending were held-
down. I

 The final tax __bill would give a

$167 " tax cut to a
four-member family_ with income of
$20,000, deductions totaling 23'
percent of income and a current tax
bill of $2,180. A couple with no
dependents and $20,000 income

6 would get a $98 reduction from the

present $2,555. A single person with
the same income would receive $117
off the current $3,232.

In typical cases under $20,000
income, the cut would offset the
higher Social Security taxes that will
go into effect next Jan. 1.‘ There
would be few cases in vv”h'ich.the tax

p cut would be large enough ~3to'§ offset

the Social Security increase and the
heavier income-tax burden caused

typical ‘

deduction, for state and ‘local
gasoline taxes.
For the first time, some

unemployment.compensation
would be taxed also when the
recepient’s total income exceeds"
$20,000, if single, and $25,000, if
marrie’cl}.WThis would affect about
900,000 persons.‘

Over objections of Republican
members, the conferences junked a
provision allowing a tax credit of up
to $250 for college tuition and"
another that would have‘ provided
additional tax cuts of $164.5 billion
in 1980. through 1983 if Congress
held down the growth of federal
spending. '

The bill would increase the‘
current. $750-per-person exemption
to $1,000; repeal the existing
$35-per-person credit; raise the
standard deductions to $2,300 for
single persons and $3,400 for
couples and cut individual tax rates.

An existing tax credit of up to $400
for . poor working families with
children would be raised to $500,
and-some of the benefits would be

made available to families with

incomes up to $10,000.’ ‘

The new tax break for ‘persons
over 55_ who sell their homes and
don't buy another costing at least as.
much is ‘a trimmed -version of a
provision the House had voted for
all persons, regardless of age.

The compromise would allow a
person 55 orolder a tax-free profit of
up to $100,000 from the-sale of the
home in which he or she had lived for

three of the lastiﬁve years. A person

The Carter administration origi-
nally opposed any cut in the capital

‘ gains tax, but agreed last week that

a cut of about $2 billion would be
acceptable. The compromise
version would cost about $2.1
billion. ‘ 7

' The net effect of the bill would be
to cut the current 49.1 percent
maximum tax on capital gains to 28
percent. .

This would be done by increasing
the current 50 percent exemption on
capital-gains to 60 percent. Forty
percent would be taxed at the same
rate applied to the’ taxpayer's
regular income.

After a $20,000 exclusion, the
other 60 percent of capital gains
would be subject to a new graduated
“-alternative minimum tax” of up to
25 percent, which would be paid

only if it exceeds the‘person’s

regular income tax.
‘ The reduction in capital gains
is aimed at increasing

ican businesses. Opponents claim
there are -far better ways to induce
investment in stocks; they note that
more than half of capital gains are
from such holdings as art help the
economy.

. The business tax cuts in. the
package include cutting the maxi-
mum tax on corporate profits to 46
percent and the lowest rate to 17
percent,

  Trudeau’s Fate

OTTAWA- Candians pass judge-
ment on the Prime Minister Pierre
Elliot Trudeau and his- government
today _in a series of special
parliamentary elections that may
forecast his fate-in next year’s
elections that may forecast his fate in
next year’s national campaign. ’
Canada’s sagging economy has
been the dominant issue, but the
Quebec separatist movement and
Trudeau’s personal leadership are
key elements in the background.

Fifteen empty seats among the

House of Commons’ 264 electoral ‘

districts are up for grabs in the
by-elections, and opposition spokes-
men say ‘a poor showing by
Trudeau’s governing Liberal Party
will increase pressure on the prime
minister to resign.

Rushing The
Anti-Apartheid
  Question

The anti-apartheid group, the “Pitt out of South

cAfrica Coalition,” in only its second meeting last

Thursday night (Oct. 12), discussed the possibilityof
picketing the mid-November University Board of
Trustees meeting. ,

This is a fine idea. Theoretically, the best way to

-solve a problem is through its source—the' $31.
million the University board has invested in com- .

panics doing business in South Africa.
Few doubt that the cause is unjust—the Student

:Government Board, representative of the student

body, even went so far as to pass a resolution in-
troduced by coalition member Bob Wagner, urging
the University divest those monies. Compared to
boards in the past four years, such strong action is
rare.

But the coalition is too eager to have.its point

i heard—the November deadline is much too soon to

present a good argument to 40 Pitt’s-financial-

welfare-is~crucial-minded Trustees, 15 of whom also
hold interest in businesses in South African com-
panies.

In this -University, the only way to make a point
with the administration is to: (1) have a good cause,
(2) provide reasonable alternatives to solve the
problem and (3) have a student, support. Again, the
coalition has an exellent cause in the protection of
human rights but so far has not released any alter-
natives to help solve the problem and has not proven
it has a large student backing. .

As for alternatives, the coalition only has create

' the proper steering, research and education commit-

tees needed to investigate solutions. Given that these.

committees will meet as soon as possible, half ‘ a
month is not enough to compile a well-research
report. ’

Student support is,the major problem. Exactly 25 '

people showed up for the last meeting——good, con-
sidering the lack of publicity the group has received
so far, but bad as far as representation of the entire
student body is concerned. All the trustees need do is
learn just how few memebers make up the coalition
and’ label it as a mere “radical” group of the only
students on campus interested in the human rights
issue. More student power punch is needed.

Wagner seems tolgnow how to gain student sup-
port when he statedin a Pitt News article (Friday,
Oct. 13) that “Students don’t know what apartheid
is...they don’t know -what Pitt’s ‘ investments are
doing” and continued that students first must be in-

formed of the situation in South Africa. A petition,

a solid piece of evidence, is needed to prove that a
great number of students support the coalition’s
claims. But first, as Wagner claims, the students
must be educated on the circumstances of the
problem——educating over 12,000 undergraduate
students, much less circul_ati_ng_ a petition to earn the
needed nufnber of signatures for support, will take
longer than half a month. ,

To be effective, the coalition should aim for a later
deadline on urging the Board of Trustees to divest
South African interests. A rushed, thrown‘-together
presentation with uneducated or no factual student

‘backing will be laughed off by any thinking man.

And that would be a shame—any future hopes of

urging divestment, by the Coalition or other student ‘
group, would suffer a damaging blow against its

credibility. ' _ ‘

_to the District of Columbia.

On the Statehood of Washington,'D;C._r .

By MAGGIE MCKAY

The United States Constitution
has been amended only 26 times
since its adoption nearly 200 years
ago.‘ There are now two amend-
ments ﬁghting for state ratifica-

- tion, the most prominent being the

Equal Rights Amendment. But the
other heeds attention also an
amendment that would grant
voting representation in Congress
The
proposal, which must be ratiﬁed by
38 states in the next seven years,
would enable district residents’ to,
elect two U.S. senators and‘ the
number of, representatives war-
ranted by its population.

Essentially, this amendment
would grant the District of
Columbia the status of a state in
both the Senate and the House of
Representatives as matters stand
now, The'District of Columbia is a
politically neutral federal city.
Article 1, section 8 of the
Constitution vests authority over
the affairs of the District of
Columbia in the Congress and
gives it exclusive legislative juris-

diction over the seat of govern-
ment.

Special committees in both the ,

House and Senate deal with district
affairs. The city does have a mayor
and a 13-member legislative

council, but it has no autonomy. "

The District of Columbia self-
government and Governmental
Reorganization Act of 1973 gave
Congress veto power over any
legislative act of the D.C. Council.
Under the 1973 legislation, the
district cannot, among other
things, enact a commuter tax on
the non-residents working in the
area, make any change in the
organization or jurisdiction of D.C.
courts or levy atax on any federal
property.

Congress also must approve the
district's budget and m_ay enact
legislation for the district on any
subject. It also can amend or repeal
any‘ law in force in the district

Opponents to the constitutional
amendmentstate, that the exist-
ence of the congressional commit-
tees provides the district with
enough representation. They also
believe it lacks any economic or

social characteristics that would~

warrant treating it as ifvit were a
state. They argue that most of the
residents are federal employees
who maintain their voting ‘registra-
tion in other ‘states, and therefore
are not without adequate represen-
tation. But more importantly, they

fear that House Joint Resolution
554 will dilute the equal suffrage of

each state in the Senate.

Jesse Helms, a Republican spoke
against the amendment on the floor
of the Senate, saying, “It is
obvious that if the 50 states have
equal representation, the adding of
two more Senators who do not
represent a State cheapens the
representation and dignity of the
States themselves. We know the

inflation that resultsfor the dollar‘

when we expend the money supply
to pay the federal deﬁcit. -This
proposal is inﬂation of the vote in
the Senate."

Otheri argumerits hinge on the _

intention of America's founding

fathers. Some senators argue that ‘-

failure, to give the district two
senators was neither an oversight

nor an accident, as the framers,

wanted to set aside an area free
from any state's influence.

Be that as it may, the population

of the district is ' now almost
700,000--almost larger than seven
states. The residents of the district
paid $1.4 billion in federal taxes in
.the 1977 ﬁscal year--an amount
greater than the taxes paid by 11
states. The_per capita tax burden
for district residents is $2,116 or
$491 above the national average.

The district does receive federal
payments that are not available to
the states, but those monies are
intended to offset the overall

negative ﬁscal impact of the federal -.

government on the District. It is an
effort by Congress to- ease the

burdens imposed on the city by the \

tax-exempt federal land and
buildings.
5 The basis of American political
thoughtrests on the concept of the
consent of those ‘governed. The.
obligations of citizenship can be

imposed only by the consent of the”
' citizens. Within the states, this

consent is obtained and "enacted
through the election of represen-
tatives to Congress.

The residents of the'District of
Columbia fulﬁll all the obligations
of American citizenship. They must
pay taxes andidefend the country in
the time of war (237 district
residents were killed in Vietnam--a
casualty level higher than that of

states such as Delaware, Vermont 5,,

&_Nevada). Although many who
live in the district retain resident
status in other states, there is a
signiﬁcant number of people who
are;-,_‘;distrjct natives a_nd__ who,

. therefore,__are without a voice in the

way. tgtggtfcity is, governed. The
comnfttttees in the House and
Senate ".’§can repeal or amend
legislation , without imput . from
district residents.

~_-_.:.-.-r~~ .i—« it ;,l'J1egprol§lem.of statehood aside,

it is a matter offundamen-tal justice
to , extend the full rights of
representative government to the
citizens of the nation's capital. All ,

representatives in Congress--and‘
thus \have a voice in their
governance. ”

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Financial Aid Ofﬁce must be one of
the most mismanaged, ,mucked-up
and unorganized student services
on campus. -

At the undergraduate school I
attended all ﬁnancial aid was
already subtracted from the tuition
bill sent out over the summer. Just
pay the balance. Simple. No “over
there" to chase this form. “up
there" to get this signed and
"Down there" again. Everything
was run from one central location.
And if there was any question, your
financial record would appear
instantly on the computer ‘screen.
Unlike at Pitt. 1

You can imagine my disgust
when, after waiting 3‘/zhours,in
line, I heard a conversation akin to
this: i

A Financial id Needs A id

‘'1 can't find X's ‘ﬁle, I looked in

V the drawer.’ '

"‘Did you check on Y's desk?"

“No, oh here ’is Z’s ﬁ1e—
remember when we were looking
for that?"

No wonder there is such a long
line!

What is even worse is that this is
conﬁdential material concerning
you and I-that gets strewn about
with seeming unconcern. Is this
the kind of “student service" we
desire? _

Recently I’ went back to the
Financial Aid Ofﬁce to get another
form. “Sorry, but we don't h ve
yours." the lady told me.“
“Somebody goofed." -

‘Q. Elliot Richardson, United States
ambassador-at-large and President
Carter’s representative to the
United Nation's Law of the Sea
conference told reporters at a news

  conference at the Pitt Law School

Friday about his current appoint-
ments, his future and his role in the
Watergate investigations.

. = In his current position as Carter’s

representative in the Law of the
Sea conference, Richardson rep-
resents the United States in
negotiations with 128 other count-
ries to agree on a treaty that would
set rules for the world’s seaways.

The conference has almost come
to an agreement on a treaty. The

“People have accepted the
responsibility (to be more alert),”
said Keemer. “I’m happy to say
student government has reinforced

‘this and ’ students are complying
with the requests to be more
responsible. I know this has been
part of theproblem,- but I think
other things could be worked on.”

The security committee that
Keemer heads has made several
proposals that would improve
securtiy at Lothrop, and it plans to
present those suggestions to
University officials at a meeting
tonight. -

The suggestions include the
closing of all entrances and exits to
the building except the main
entrance, and the placement of
security doors on the eight female
ﬂoors in the dorm and ‘locks on all
exit doors. These security doors
would be like the ones in the
Towers, which can only be
unlocked by residents who live on '
the ﬂoor. ,

The committee also proposes
that locks be placed on all
bathnroom doors‘ so that only
residents of a certain floor could
enter the bathrooms.

JoAnn Gibbs, assistant director
of the Ofﬁce of Residence Life, said

_ there are some security problems

at Lothrop.

“The Inthrop desk is one of. the
worst situations. we have,” she.
said. She explained that the glass
partition that separates the atten-
dant from, people entering the
building makes it difficult for the
attendant to monitor the doors.

G:i-bbs added that she hoped
some improvements in the security
system could be made. “I think its
possible but its going to take a little
work," she said. .

that business and labor curb their
demands, but somewhere short of
mandatory wage and price controls
that hardly anyone wants. Carter
has already indicated that some
form of government sanction would

result if wage’ demands exceed 7

percent and prices go up more than
53/4 percent. .
izconomists have often been

called upon by the White House to
prescribe cures for the mysterious

several ‘who have advised past

presidents were asked what “inﬂa- v

only major obstacle is the question
of sea mining fo_r minerals, mostly
nickel, outside of coastal countries’
200 mile “economic limit." The
U.S. 1 recently passed legislation
allowing business concerns to mine
outside the limits and is insisting
that the treaty must recognize the
acquired rights of the U.S.
companies. -

Richardson said the clause
recognizing the. United States’
acquired rights must be included in
the treaty before he would even
submit it to the Senate for approval.
He said developing countries don't

seems to resist a cure.

To Prof. Walter Heller, chief
economic adviser to Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson and now a
teacher the the University of
Minnesota, the problem has its,
most clear-cut historic roots in the
shortages and stunning price rises
of raw goods and fuel that marked
1973 and 1974.

But now - nearly four years later
- labor. has seized its chance to
“catch up” with those" higher

workers like farmers. Food prices
have gone up 9.7 percent in the last
eight months. Unfortunately wages
are rising rapidly but productivity
is not. '

the developing countries would
hinder the search for minerals.
Richardson was also Attorney
_General during the Watergate

Investigation. He called ex-Presid- .

ent Nixon’s order to fire Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox an act of
“impropiety" and said he resigned
rather than follow Nixon’s order to
fire Cox.

Richardson, who has held four
cabinet posts and has been
ambassador to Great Britain, was
-asked if he had any intentions of
running for public office. He
answered that he “misses politics“
in his bipartisan job but would most
likely not be running for any office
in 1980 because he prefers to stay
with his current positions. -. '

productivity is rising 1 or 2 percent \

Workers aren’t‘entirely to blame

Heller. Industryhas been too slow
in making needed investments‘ in

agers in the latest techniques, and
in making work and ftlie workplace

labor to curb their wage and price

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

“I don’t know what it is about
that song," said Chuck Mangione
about “Feels So Good,”/ the
instrumental jazz‘ number that
propelled him to stardom after 20
years of professional work. The

D “Topcforty is an unusual place to
-— have a song."

During a press conference in
Schenley Hall's Venetian Room
Friday, Mangione held forth his
feelings on the success of “Feels
So‘ Good" and his place in the field
of jazz.

The album's success has been’

, puzzling to Mangione who was in
‘Pittsburgh for two concerts this

weekend. “I don’t think the music
is different than anything we’ve
done before.“ The entire album,
was composed in
three days. ' A
Despite increasing criticism from
colleagues who claim‘ Mangione
“went commercial” with “Feels So

Good," hesaid that a top forty hit ._

was advantageous in ways other’

” than monetary.

“Jazz musicians. are their own
worst enemies,” Mangione said.
“As soon as anyone has “a, hit,
everyone writes him off as a
prostitute. 4Person’ally, I think
everyone should be cheeri‘n’g'their

And if someone likes the p

out and listen to the artist's other,

Success 'also makes innovation
possible, Mangione said, citing his
latest album, “Children of San-
which he describes as

“I think that if_ “Feels So Good"
hadn’t happened, “Children of
Sanchez" would never have been
possible. . I’d never have dared to
do that project if I hadn’t done
“Feels So Good,” Mangione said.

“Children of Sanchez” is a‘

musical interpretation of a series of  always desirable.

stories about a Mexican family.
Nothing in the album is geared for
hit single status, but, then,
Mangione feels that none of his
previous albums were aimed at that
market either._

“When I brought the tapes in for
to A & M
records, they said, ‘We have a hit

‘on our hands’ but I don’t think

there\ was anything different
conceptually speaking.’ I never did
make a hit single, all Idid was
make an album," he said. “I just
keep writing music and playing it.

_ If you write the music and play it, it

has your own identity."

As a child in Rochester, N.Y.,
Mangione was exposed to the great
jazz artists of C‘ the 1950’ _Dizzy
Gillespie, Art Blakely and John
Coltrane. Today, Mangione says
he doesn’t have any personal

Marks. ‘The Big Fix’ 

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

The Big Fix '
Universal Pictures
Directed by Jeremy Paul Kagen

Pitt News Staff Writer

- candidate.

Moses Wine is a modern day Los Angeles gumshoe with problems.
He’s a disillusioned casualty of the 1960s Berkeley underground,
divorced and behind in his child support payments for his two young sons,
drives around in a beat up Volkswagen, lives in a seedy apartment and is
broke.

In “The Big Fix” Oscar winner Richard Drevfuss stars as the
keen‘-witted but disgusted modern day private eye ’ who has been
trudging through the 1970s with apathetic cynicsim. ‘

The plot revolves around Wine’s involvement with a political smear
campaign against a California gubernatorial candidate that leads to an

/intense web of mystery and murder.

The action starts with Wine being found-through a quirk of fate by his

‘\ old Berkeley heartthrob (Susan Anspasch).

She now works on the campaign staff of a conservative gubernatorial
Her boss," the campaign manager, -is played by John
Lithgrow, himself a man with a secret radical past. He hires Wine to find
an Abby Hoffman-like character from the 60s named Howard Eppis
whom he believes is responsible for printing bogus posters featuring
himself posedwith the candidate. _

This would beipolitically damaging and leads Dreyfuss and Anspasch
off on a trial they hope will lead to answers about the smear campaign.

Anspasch’s involvement gets her murdered by two hit men who have ’

been hired by a revengeful industrialist (F ritz-Weaver) who is trying to
defame the members of the fictitious California Four.

It’ s a cammando radical group that caused him great embarassmefff in
the 605 since his son, Lithgrow, was a member along with the missing
radical leader Eppis. .

Along the way, a leftist farm worker leader is kidnapped in order to I
draw attention to the disappearing Berkeley radical. movement that
Weaver hopes to frame by killing the candidate with an explosion on the
LA." Freeway. ' ‘

What makes the film so enjoyable is Dreyfuss’s modern-Vday
interpretation of the anti-hero detective.

He smokes grass. has a wife who he married to avoid the draft, and he

' is stuck with the responsibility of raising two sons he brings along on his

investigations because his wife refuses to babysit them. .
Unlike many of the famous screen sleuths such as Sam Spade and
Phillip Marlowe, Wine, a character adapted from a best selling book by
reporter Roger Simon, is humorous because of his klutziness and
compassion, not his cool aloffness. ~ '
Wine was a_ man who marched in the 60s. He belonged to all of the
leftist student groups and he’s bitter int he 705 because he feels nobody
strives for anything beyond the status quo. ,
He's turned to the unlikely career of private investigator because to

,.some degree it offers personal freedom while also hiding himcfrom a

society that has let him down in every possible way.

“There are many people I enjoy,
liut I’m not the sort of person who
rushes out to buy somebody’s
latest album to find direction,” he
said.

Currently working ‘ on a live
album taped during a concert at the
Hollywood Bowl early this summer, ' ‘
Mangione said the change in

audiences since “Feels So Good”
has been tremendous but not‘

“Our crowd is now a very diverse
one,” Mangione explained. “It
ranges from kids in ’ grammar
school. I think college audiences,
tend to be more vocal because of
the way ‘they've been conditioned
at rock concerts not that I favor
,that. I know a lot of good
rnusic——solos, quiet songs'—that are
.covered up by audience reactions.”
When composing, Mangione
said he usually creates first, with
no concept in mind. C
“Music comes first,” he saidV\
“You try to ﬁgure out what the
_music feels like before» you decide
on a title.”

Pittsburgh was treated to a night of humor as Martin

the Stanley Theatre. c _

From the moment Mull took the stage, clad in a white
suit and surrounded byiliving room fggfniture, there was
never a dull moment.  I ‘

Playing an electric _guitar and accompanied by
A pianist Ed Wise, Mull entertained the audience with a
repertoire of outrageous songs: “Men” (the first folk

song, according to Mull), “Noses,” ‘Do the Nothing,”.

the bluesy “Siamese Twins”_ and an‘ untitled song in
which Mull hummed rather than voicing obscenities.

These songs, coupled with Mull’s classic one-liners,"
subtle humor (“It’s so hard to say ‘good-bye, so let’s
just say hors d’oeuvres’’) and tremendous

communication with the audience, made Mull’s ,
“Woodstock,” as he called it, an experience in comedy »

This season, there seems to be an abundance of new
detective series in which the main character solves a
big problem every week. In contrast, “Dallas” is one
show that has its main character actually causing the
problems for other characters.

“Dallas” revolvesaround the Ewing family at the
Southford ranch.- They control a major company,
Ewing Oil (what else?). - .

Larry‘Hagman, whom “I-Dream of Jeannie” fans
will remember, plays J. R. Ewing, the ruthless older
brother. His main goal is total control of Ewing Oil,
and his tactics every week center around intimidating

his wife so he can have someone to cheaton, and Gary,
the middle brother who left his wife and daughter
sixteen years ago to pursue his new found gambling
career. .
Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes play the

Singer Kenny Rankin, who has been labeled a “folk A __
romanticist,” appeared as Mull’s opening act. Afte'r4‘,ff

opening the show with the haunting “~‘She’s a" Lady”

and a few songs from the 30s and 40s, Rankin swerved , 

into an atypical medley of Stevie Wonder, Laura Nyro,

Billy Preston and Paul McCartney tunes. Next Rankin, 5. .v;_._;,_l
4 who: had beenplaying acoustical guitar, went to the —  ‘.—
piano and, with his bassist and’ "drummer (Peter? ' 

Marshall and Ron ‘Kirby, respectively), began a light
jazz jam session. ‘ . .

This uncoordinated programldiminished the effects ; _
of Rankin’s tremendous vocal abilities and left.theg'i" 
L audience confused. It was obvious that Rankin not only'_»_, A f

was out of his realm as a musician, but also was out of

place as a concert performer. Listening to Rankin’s " 

music in a concert setting is not nearly as enlightening

and entertaining an experience as listening to one of - 
his albums. A ’ .  _.
The evening was a disappointment tovall but the mo_st--  _.
devout Rankin fans. but it was salvaged by the clever 7; ; :_,:’

and ‘entertaining performance of Mull.

sassing ‘back to aunts, Lucy spendsiher time in the .» 

haystacks with the ranch hand. ’

In this season's premiere, J .R. has a real,"  
problem—brother Gary is about to return after an ' “ _'
sixteen-year absence. It seems that Gary is working in '

Las Vegas and recognizes Bobby, who is th_ere.f'or an

Oilman’s convention. Bobby persuades Gary to come .  i

back to the ranch and wee Lucy. Gary tries to make up
for lost time with Lucy and his wife, Val, w_hom J . R. '
ran out of town as soon as Gary left. ’

J . R. pretends to be grateful for Gary's return and  
helps Gary by letting him run one company‘ that has _ ’ .' ' It
proved to b_e_ a financial disaster. Gary cannotdeal‘ .' 

with the pressure and ﬁnallyleaves, saying that he
doesn’t belong on the farm. Soon after, his wife leaves
because she knows that sooner or later J .R. would

make sure of it. ~‘ , _‘3"

What's odd is that both Pam and Bobby have seen

what J . R. is capable of and they do nothing about it. 1 

Their purpose is to fall prey to the /wickedschemes of '
J.R. every‘week._ ‘ -
“Dallas” stands on shaky ground. Who would

think the authors could manage a plausible story every‘

week about a powerful brother intimidating and
victimizing his own family? However, the show does

have one asset, and that is Larry Hagman. He plays
into his role well as the guy you’d love to hate. The '

“good ole boy” attitude he puts on when he’s with

Daddy and Mama "is amusing, and his mild Texan? ‘ I .. :

  Dreyfuss’ ‘Big Fix’
Amusing and Realistic

I / (Continued from page 11)

There are many humorous moments that director Jeremy Paul Kagan
(“Heroes”) serves up in thisnicely balanced detective thrilller.

The death of the hopes and dreams of 60s radicals like Wine is
conveyed strongely. However, Dreyfuss’s characterization is buoyent
and determined as he deals with his misfortune and solves this, the
biggest and most important case in his dreary career.

Rounding out the ﬁne supporting Case are Bonnie Bedelia as his
selfish wife and Ofelia Medina as Chicano comrade of the kidnapped far
leader. _

Dreyfuss was involved with the actual protests and marches at
Berkeley and the audience can feel his deep nostalgia for the character
through the actions of Wine. ‘

His strongest scenes come when we see the compassion of the
displaced radical Wine. 3

Although his kids come from an unhappy marriage of convenience, he
is a good father is brought to tears when they are nearly shot by the two
hit men hired to stop him.

In another scene he is shown crying in a public library as he watches
documentary footage taken at the time of Berkeley.

Unquestionably, “The Big Fix’ ’ is one ofthe best films of the year and
one of the few ﬁlms of recent memory that takes such a bittersweet and _
complete backtrack look at the 605, one of the most signiﬁcant eras in the
history of America. '

Pitt News Staff Writer

SOUTH BEND, Ind.—-“If you had
told me they (Notre Dame) would
score 19 points in the fourth quarter
on our defense, I‘ never would have
believed it,” said Jackie Sherrill.

Believeable or not, the ninth-
ranked ‘Pitt Panthers lost theirﬁrst
game of the season to a ﬁred-up
Notre Dame squad, 26-17, Saturday
before a sellout crowd of 59,075.

Irish quarterback Joe Montana
had a hand in all three fourth-quarter
touchdowns as he threw for two and
ran for the other score. Montana
completed 11 E>f15‘ passes in the
second half,’ which included, a

_seven-for-seven performance in -the

ﬁnal period to earn offensive

player-of-the-game honors.

The Panthers seemed to have the
game under control until Montana
began his Superman imitation.

Notre Dame got on the scoreboard
in the ﬁrst quarter by taking
advantage - of an interception by
cornerback Tom Gibons and driving
39 yards for the touchdown. The
two-yard scoring run by Jerome
Heavens was the ﬁrst /touchdown
allowed by the Panthers  the initial
period in the last ’18 games.

The Panthers were content to run

the option and throw a variety of.

short passes early in trying to ﬁnd
the soft spot in the ‘Irish defense.
«Pitt knotted the score with a
79-yard drive in the second quarter
capped by a three-yard run by Rick
Trocano for the touchdown. The

‘Panthers achieved almost perfect

balance on the drive by rushing for
43 yards and gaining 36 through the
air. Trocano converted two
third-and-long situations, once
ﬁnding Gordon Jones slanting over
the middle, and again by hitting
Ralph Still on a comeback. pattern
after being forced from the pocket.

Tonight

Chicago at Denver

only when necessary, Montana
brought Notre Dame,73 yards before
the drive stalled at the Pitt 7-yard
line. Joe Unis came on to miss his
second ﬁeld goa.l in 10 minutes, but
the Irish had- proven they could
move the ball on the Pitt defense.

“Our kids did not get‘ down on

each other at all,” said Irish head
coach Dan Devine. “We didn't let
the missed field goal bother us. -We
kept putting the pressure on
Pittsburgh and ﬁgured something
good would--happen  -we kept
putting pressure on them.”

The Pitt offense responded by
puitting» seven more‘ points worth of
pressure on Notre Dame with
another touchdown three and

a 7-6 lead on the first of. two
touchdown passes by quarterback
Brian Sipe. A
The Steelers, held to 67 yards
total offense in the first half put
their seventh-straight victory in the
bag with two long scoring drives in
-the third period,the first culmin-
ated by Terry Bradshaw’s 28-yard
pass to Lynn Swann and the other
capped by Rocky Bleier’s one-yard
run. The Browns, 4-3, hurt their
own cause with three ﬁrst-half
fumbles--the first two setting up
Roy Gerela’s ﬁeld goals--and two
interceptions. Mike Wagner's
interception of a Sipe pass early in
the third period started the Steelers
on a 69-yard march that was the
first sustained drive of the game for
Pittsburgh." ' _
Sipe, who earlier hit Dave Logan
with a 17-yard scoring pass, added’
a 19 yarder to Reggie.Rucker for
Cleveland's ﬁnal score early in the
fourth quarter. ’
I The Browns made an unsuccess-
ful try on fourth down and six at

one-half minutes into the final
period.

The Panthers covered the entire
62 yards on the ground, but kept the
Irish on their toes with a couple of.

interesting calls. On second-and-
short, Trocano barely overthrew
Jones on a ﬂy pattern, and on first
down, an option pass from Larry-
Sims to Jones was ruled incomplete.

On the option pass, Jones once
again proved he is no ordinary split

..end. With the ball upfor grabs,

Jones jockeyed for position with Joe
Restic, outjumped him and tipped
the ball up to keep it in play. When
Restic fell, Jones went up and
grabbed the ball. After he took two
steps, Dave Waymer came over and

midﬁeld on their next possession.
Pittsburgh’ scored three plays later
on Bradshaw’s 32-yard pass to John
Stallworth. , .

Pittsburgh fullback Franco"
Harris rushed for 41 yards on 15
carries to move‘ past former Steeler
John Henry Johnson as the seventh
leading rusher in NFLhistory, with
6,843 yards.

The Steelers got off to a 6-0 lead
after coming up with two Cleveland
turnovers in the first period, before
a crowd numbering 81,302, the
largest in the NFL this season.

Steeler cornerback Mel Blount
intercepted Sipe’s‘pass on the third
play of the game and ran it back 35
yards to the Browns’ 15. Three
plays gained 9 yards and Gerela
made it 3-0 with a 23-yard ﬁeld goal

just 3:33 into the game.

The Browns moved from their \
own 26 to Pittsburgh’s 44 on the

next possession before fullback

Cleo Miller fumbled. The Steelers
recovered at the Cleveland 48 and
marched to the 27.before calling on

Pitt's wrestling team, ranked
20th in 1977, begins practice today
for its Nov. 21 opener against
Bloomsburg State. The Panthers
need to ﬁll the void left by four
graduated starters, and they hope
to answer questions about whether
this year's team can match last
year's 13-4 record.

“Balance will be the key to our
whole season," coach Dave Adams
said. “We lost some good
-wrestlers. Mark Stepanovich
(heavyweight), Bill Bailey (190
pounds), George O’Korn (177
pounds) and Rande Stottlemyer
(134 pounds) won a heck of a lot
more matches than they lost for us.
It's going to be hard to replace

them.”

 

According" to =Stottlemyer, a
former all-America and now a Pitt
assistant, the wrestlers have mixed
emotions about starting practice.

‘‘I think they are looking forward
to returning to the mat,” said
Stottlemyer. “But I think they
know once practice starts, the long,
hard season also starts."

1

“We're in pretty good shape,’
Adams observed. “We have some
very good guys returning in some
of the lower weight divisions.”

Glenn Maxwell. (118 pounds) and
Jose.Martinez (126 pounds), 'both
Eastern Wrestling League cham-
pions and NCAA Championship
participants a year ago, return for
the Panthers. Also back are spot
starters Steve "Gouletas (142
pounds), Mike Bond (150 pounds),

 

GraPDIersOPenPractice

Ed Bredniak«(150 pounds), Tom
Jones (160 pounds) and Jim
Gordon (167 pounds). Gordon, one
of four seniors on the team, and
Jones ﬁnished third in the EWL
Championships last season.

Recruits Steve "Smokey” Smo-
charski (heavyweight), John Chen-
dy (177 pounds) and Jeff Gordon
(134 pounds) are expected ‘to ﬁll
three of the vacancies.

At 6-9‘/2, 375 pounds, Smochar-
ski is believed to be the biggest
athlete ever to attend Pitt.

3 “He's a goodone,” Stottlemyer
said of the transfer from Keystone
Junior‘ College. “I saw him
wrestling Bill Bailey the other day,
and I was quite impressed. Few
people handle Bailey the way
Smokey did that day.”

Team T hatLives by the Defense, Dies by the Defense

SOUTH BEND, Ind.—The Pitt Panthers, a team
that was supposed to live by its defense in 1978, died
because of that unit Saturday against Notre Dame
with the entire nation looking on. _

The breakdown, which allowed the Irish to over-
come a 17-7 deficit in less than 14 minutes, was com-
plete. The Notre Dame offensive line was dominant
whether it was opening holes for Jerome Heavens
and Vagas Ferguson or pass blocking for Joe Mon-
tana. The secondary was not much better; on several
occasions the Notre Dame receivers were open th
moment the ball was snapped. ‘

Head coach Jackie Sherrill once said the way to tell
if a team played well defensively is to see who made
the tackles. If most of the tackles were made by the
linemen and linebackers, the defense played better
than if the stops were made by the secondary:

D An analysis of the statistics shows Pitt had a poor
game defensively by its own coach’s standards.

Cornerbacks Willie Marsh and J OJ 0 Heath were in
on eight and six tackles, respectively, against the Irish
compared to- four and two in the Boston College
game. Jeff Delaney made five tackles Saturday and
only two against the Eagles, while free ‘safety Mike

Balzer was involved in eight stops this week and none .

Fll'S'C and Goal

By BOB LABRIOLA

The defense has had trouble stopping the opponent

following a Pitt turnover throughout the year.
Although Notre Dame scored two touchdowns
following Panther turnovers Saturday, the Irish were
required to drive more than 30 yards to hit paydirt.
Quite a contrast from the 1977 game when Pitt fum-
bled five times in its own territory and still held the
Irish to 19 points. '
The Notre Dame game made one thing perfectly
clear—-Pitt does not have the defensive personnel to

' line up against a team such as the Irishand dominate.

Greg Meisner and Bill Neill are good football

players (maybe in a couple years great football

players), but againstian offensive line ‘with the size
and experience Notre Dame put on the field, they
come up a little short. _
Because of the complexity of pass defenses, it is
difficult to point any accusing fingers, but anyone

_who saw the game knows the secondary was porous.
Marsh and whoever else was supposed to be covering
the Notre Dame tight ends all had a long afternoon.
Kris Haines, Dennis Gringinger and Dean Masztak
combined for 10 receptions for 167 yards and one
touchdown. None of the catches had to be made in a
crowd. Pitt broke up seven passes and intercepted
four against Boston College, compared to no inter-
ceptions and one defensed pass against the Irish‘.
Montana is a good quarterback, but there are bet-
ter ones on the\horizon——Chuck Fusina, Jimmy Jor-
dan and Wally Woodham. If the secondary cannot
manage to get any closer to the wide receivers, all the
quarterbacks will look good. — .
The defense, which played well for 46 minutes
Saturday," will have to rebound much the same way

the offense did. The Panthers no longer can stiﬂethe '

offenses of the Notre Dames and Penn States the way
it was done the last couple years. The team no longer
can depend on a single player or one unit to survive
adversity. More‘than any timeover the last three
seasons, Pitt must as a 40-man unit. ’ ._
There are no more Tony Dorsetts, Matt-

V Cavanaughs, Randy Holloways or Bob Jurys. The

MariaParis' Leads Pantherettes to High Tourney Finish

By CINDY NATALI

Quality, not quantity, came
through for Pitt’s women’s tennis
team when it captured a fourth
place finish at the Eastern
Collegiate Tournament last week-
endin New Paltz, N.Y.

Despite playing with only a
partial team, Pitt followed behind
Princeton, Virginia and Penn ‘State.
Thirty-seven schools participated.

The top two singles players and
the top two doubles teams usually
represent each school. Pitt

‘entered two singles players and

   

NOTICE

only one doubles team, however.
Maris Paris and Janet Decostro
represented Pitt in the singles
while Lisa LaFuria and Randi
Belkin teamed in the doubles.

A pleased Irma Pytka, Pitt’s
assistant coach, said, “All of them
did very well. It was a good
tournamnet for us.”

For the ﬁrst time, Paris, Pitt’s
number one player reached the
semiﬁnals at ’ Easterns. Although
the official results will not be

known until later today, Pytka said"

that Paris would ﬁnish third or
fourth in the singles since there

6-1, 6-2. Paris then beat Gina
Bribando of Gallsboro, 6-0, 6-1.

For the second time in two

  Skins Lose First

By ‘The Associated Press

The Rhiladelphia Eagles, led by‘

running back Wilbert Montgomery
and defensive end Dennis Harrison,
knocked the Washington Redskins

' from the National Footba1l.League’s
unbeaten ranks yesterday with a
17-0 victory. ‘

That left only two NFL clubs
unbeaten after seven weeks of the
season -- the Pittsburgh Steelers,
who whippedthe Cleveland Browns
34-14, and the Los Angeles Rams,
who defeated the Minnesota Vikings
3_4-17. 

Montgomery rushed for 125 yards
on 25 carries, his fourth 100-yard

I plusrunning game of the season,

and scored the game-winning
touchdown for the Eagles on a
12-yard run in the fourth quarter.
Harrison, a rookie who only plays
in passing situations, had two
quarterback sacks, knocked down a
pass and caused a fumble against the
stunned Redskins.
Rookie Larry Anderson’s 95-yard

kickoff return late in the first half’

put the Steelers in front and they
went ‘on to beat the Browns, their
closest rival in the American

“Maria really played beautiful
tennis,” said Pytka.

In the semiﬁnals, Paris met Jan
Devereux from defending cham-
pion Princeton. 'Paris put her
under in two sets, 6-2, 6-2, to clinch
a spot in the top ﬁve.

Decostro stacked up enough wins
to reach the quarterﬁnals. Al-
though weakened by a bad cold,
she continued to play well through
the tournament, according to
Pytka.

Decostro downed Kean’s' Raquel

Oliverius. 4-6, 7-6, 7-0 in the ﬁrst

round. Moving on, shebeat Heidi
Hess of Madison, 6-4, 6-1.

Her 6-4, 6-0 victory over Cathy
Stanton of Trenton carried De-
costro to the quarter ﬁnals. But
Joy McManus, the third-seeded
player from Penn State, proved to
be too much and beat Decostro,
6-3, 6-3'on her way to the ﬁnals.

Playing for the ﬁrst time as a
doubles team, freshman Belkin and
LaFuria reached the quarterﬁnals
in the consolation matches. They
won four matches and lost two in
the competition.

recovered at the Pitt 31-yard line.
“I guess I surprised him with the
pitch,” said Trocano. ‘ “Rooster
didn’t get his hands up in time.”
After three running plays,
Montana faced a fourth-and-two
from the Pitt 21-yard line, but
Devine knew his quarterback had a

hot hand and decided to gamble. »

The way Montana had pickedhthe
Panthers apart in the second half
made the move a9 virtual sure thing.

Tightend Jeff Grindinger found a
gaping hole in the secondary,

Montana’s throw was on the money,
and the ball was on the Pitt 8.

The defense. momentarily stif-
fened, but on fourth down from the
3-yard line, Montana found Vagas
Ferguson for Notre Dame’s third
touchdown in 12 minutes.

“Perhaps I should have gone for a
ﬁeld goal,” said Devine, “but

yards for a TD and John Cappelletti
scored on a 4-yard run, clinching the
Rams’ victory. Los Angeles’
defense limited Minnesota to 39‘
yards rushing. ,

Elsewhere, Green Bay’s Steve
Odom, who had promised that if he
scored a touchdown he would give
the game ball to an 11-year-old boy
who last week lost both legs in a
tractor accident, -ran back the
opening kickoff 95 yards for a score,

sometimes you have to go by the seat
of your pants. I had faith Joe would
find someone open on the play, and
he hit Ferguson for the clincher.”

Sherrill was ableto put his ﬁnger
on the turning point of the game.

“After we scored our last
touchdown, their 86 yard drive was
the key,” said Sherrill. “They had to
do it and they did.”

Trocano, who performed well
throughout the game, cited Montan
as the key.

“When his team was down, he

(Montana) brought them back with 1

his passing,” said Trocano. “That’s
what makes a good quarterback.
great.” ’

“When Montana hit Haines and
they went in to score and take the
lead,‘ that hurt,” said Sherrill.
“When we fumbled, and they
came.back to score again, that broke
our backs.”

You can certainly believe that.
