Patrick Gallagher is Pitt’s next chancellor and
a j okester, too. '
Gallagher jumped in the back of a photo
opportunity ofKathy Humphrey, vice provost
and dean of students, and two students yester-
day during a special Dean’s Hour that allowed
students the chance to meet Gallagher.
Gallagher might have accepted serious re-
sponsibilities as Pitt’s next chancellor, but has
notletthe power makehimseem unapproach-
able. He cracked jokes and posed with a giant
cutout ofjamie Dixon at a Pitt basketball game.
. Pitt’s Board of Trustees elected Gallagher
as the University’s 18th chancellor and chief
executive oﬂicer during a special Board meet-
ing last Saturday morning. Gallagher is the
acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Department
of Commerce and the director of the National
Insﬁtute of Standards and Technology.
While very few students attended the
Board of 'I‘rustee’s meeting, students in the
Oakland Zoo, Pitt basketball’s student section,
went wild after Gallagher was introduced as
the next chancellor before Saturday after-
noonis Pitt men’s basketball game against
iiirgiéua   the Petersen Events Center.

Students and staff met with Gallagher in a
more intimate setting during the Dean’s Hour
at Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt Union on
Sunday, concludingaweekend that Gallagher
describedas a“giant group hugfromall of Pitt
and Pittsburgh.” B

Various student groups on campus such
_as Pitt Pathﬁnders, the Blue and Gold soci-
ety, Student Government Board and athletics
teams attended Dean’s Hour to greet Pitt’s
newest chief executive. Students were also
given the opportunity to have their picture
taken with Gallagher. _ —

Audrey Ann Blakely, afreshman majorin
in computer science and physics and astrono-

. my and member ofPitt’s tennis team, attended

the Dean’s Hour and said she hoped Gallagher
will be “as accessible as he seems to be so far.”

Brandon Benjamin, an SGB Board mem-
ber, said he hopes Gallagherwillbe passionate

‘ about education and social justice.

- Gallagherfs appointment is the end result
of a six-month search by the Board of Trust-
ees to ﬁll the position of Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg, who announced” last June he
would be stepping down after 19 years as

‘ Pitt’s chancellor.

The Board assembled a26-membersearch

committee and hired Storbeck 8: Pimentel
Associates, an executive search ﬁrm, to ﬁnd
Pitt’s next leader. '

Stephen Tritch, chairman of the Board,
said Gallagher was the evident choice in a
worldwide candidate pool. ' _

Gallagher secretly visited campus twice
durjngthis period to meet the Board ofI‘rust-
ees, key leaders and constituent groups before
the Board publicly made its decision Saturday
morning in the Assembly Room of William
Pitt Union.' A ‘ .

Establishing an Agenda

When he returns to campus Aug. ‘1 as
chancellor instead of chancellor-elect, Gal-
laghersaid his ﬁrst two areas of focus will be

7 strengthening Pitt’s partnerships and engag-

ing students. ' » _ g _
Gallagher said he will work to build upon
previously established partnerships with Uni-

_ versityof Pittsburgh Medical Center, Carnegie

Mellon University, private businesses, Pitts-

.burgh’s city government, the state government '

and the federal government. _ , 
“WhatI hope I really bring is a capacity to
collaborate and build those bridges. A uni-
versity doesn’t sit by itself. It is entwined and
embedded inthe community,” Gallagher said.
Subra Suresh‘, president of CMU, said he
is excited aboutthe possibilities aheadforthe
two universities and is delighted that Galla-

V gher will become Pitt’s next chancellor.

Suresh and Gallagher have worked to-'

gether previously and partnered to launch.

several initiatives while they served as heads
of federal agencies. V
_ Suresh previously served as the director of
the National Science Foundation from 2010
until his appointment to president of CMU
in 2013. _ ‘_
Gallagher said his positions in govem—

, ment and the NIST were centered on working

with federal agencies and will help to

' collaborate.

' “It’s been in my DNA,” Gallagher said. . T l
The NIST, which Gallagher has worked

for since 1993, and Pitt already have ahealthy; 1

relationship.
Pitt received a $15 million grant inJanu—
ary 2010 from the NIST, when Gallagherwas

its head, to help fund renovations for _labo- _
- ratories in Pitt’s Department of Physics and

Astronomy.
Gallagher said he was not sure how his

. newpositionwould affectﬁiture connections ‘

between Pitt and the NIST, but like in other
areas, Gallagher said he will work to develop
a closer bond between the two.

Expanding student interest

Nordenberg and Tritch also noted_Gal—
lagher, who completed his Ph.D in physics
at Pitt in 1991, has a strong commitment to
science and research. .

However, Gallagher said he is still passion-
ate about the humanities. ‘ »

‘‘I’m a liberal arts guy at heart,” Gallagher
said.

Citingpersonal experience, Gallagher said '

he did not know whata physicist did when he
began studying physics and philosophy as an
undergraduate student at Benedictine College,
a liberal arts college located in Kansas. 4
Gallagher said it is good to focus on sci-
ence and technology, but not at the expense

_ of other areas of study.
. - STEM — science, technology, math and
' engineering — majors have been in the spot-

light at Pitt recently with the establishment
of the Discipline—Based Science Education
Research Center.

The center was established to give stu-
dents a place to work hands-on instead ofjust
reading from texts, which Gallagher said he
believes is the best way to encourage students
to retain.STEM material.

Gallagher said the University must give
students a “glimpse of the possibilities” for
what they could do with these majors.

Gallagher said Pitt must give students com-
pelling experiences that willopen up doors
and added that this applies to all ma]-prs, Pitt
athletics, arts and other facets of campus.

Pitt currently claims the unsavory title as
the most expensive public school in the United

c States, afact that Tritch said is theiresult of ,

funding cuts from the state. ,
Gallagher pointed out that he is “tuition-

V paying parent” and said hewillwork with the

Board of Trustees to tackle tuition.‘

“What you really want to ensure is the af-
fordability of the college doesn’t affect access
and education,” Gallagher said.

Gallagher said hewas openwiththe search’
committee regardingthe fact that he does not
have traditional experience in ﬁindraising.

“I mean, the federal government doesn’t
ﬁindraise unless you call that taxes,” Galla-
gher joked.

However, Gallagher added that people give
moneyto feel like part of something and said
he can use his experience in developing rela-
tionships to’ raise money for Pitt.

Tritch also noted that Gallagher had to

convince congress to ﬁind the NIST, which ,
received hundreds of millions of dollars each’

year during Gal1agher’s tenure..

Gallagher said he wants to focus on build
ing a personal relationship with the student
body. _ ’

He recognizes that.he is a new face on
campus and promises to go to “where the
people are,” rather than having the people
come to him. I I

“When I am walking on the street, I hope
people-will stop me and want to talk to‘ me',”

_ Gallagher said.

Pittsburgh Roots

1 Gallagher might be a new face to students, I

but he is a familiar sight to Pitt and the city.

His mother grew up in Pittsburgh, and
Gallagher attended second grade at a Pitts-
burgh elementary school while living with
his grandparents.

Gallagher retumed to Pittsburgh as agrad—
uate student at Pitt and met his wife, Karen,
in Pittsburgh. » -

After Gallagher completed his Ph.D in
physics at Pitt in 1991, the couple moved to
Boston so Gallagher could accept a position
as a research associate at Boston University.

“It was hard leaving Pittsburgh,” Karen

Gallagher said. “I cried my eyes out when I"

ﬁrst saw that [Boston] apartrnen .” V

Gallagher returned to Pittsburgh in April
2012 to serve as the commencement speaker
at graduation, and the University awarded him
an honorary Doctor of Publicservice degree.

Gallaghefs youngest son, Ryan, 16, accom-
panied his parents throughout the weekend.
Ryan Gallagher said he attended his ﬁrst Pitt
basketball game and received an informal
campus tour by a group of students.

“I thought [Pitt] would be intimidating

' because its urban, but I was surprised. It was

more spacedout than I thought it would be,”
Ryan Gallagher said. M
Pitt has high hopes for the elder Gallagher,
who will pick up the reins after the end of Nor-
denberg’s successful and long commitment to
the-University. . ~
_ Yet, according to Ryan, Pitt has no reason
to worry because his father will make a great
chancellor.
“—He’s always had the businessman mode.
He just kind of goes for things and knows his
stuff. He is good with people,” Ryan Gallagher

Gallaghertold the packed room of students
during Dean’s Hour to call him out if they ever
feel he is ignoring their interests.

He urged students to come to him with
their requests and not let him make them feel
marginalized. '

A In exchange, Gallagher has a request of ,
his own.

“All I ask is that you don’t call me ‘Gally.’
You got to come up with a better nickname,”
Gallagher joked, referencing longtime Nor-
denberg’s nickname, “Nordy.” I

SOPHILTHY

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

Hopefully this doesn’t come ‘as a
surprise, but a standard path that
ensures a job right after under-
grad does not exist.

While there is obviously a gen-
eral outline we can follow — the
fact that you’re attending a uni-
versity is proof that you’re follow-
ing one — there is no checklist
you can cross off each semester
to guarantee that you’re on the
right track and won’t need to
move back in with your parents
after you throw your cap in the air.

Students hoping to ﬂoat in the
postgraduate life should be {aware
that preparing themselves for the
nonacademic world requires ex-
perience that's, well, nonacadem-

ic. It’s the simplest of logic, but
it’s logic that many fail to follow:
We often concern ourselves with
ﬁnding a major that we’re pas-
sionate about and push through
our semesters thinking within the
conﬁnes of the classes required.
Yes, undergrad offers the oppor-
tunity to learn, but it also offers an
incredibly valuable opportunity
to learn outside of the classroom.
Important to note is that most
college advisers won’t take into
account the duality when check-
ing up on their students; more
often than not they will simply en-
sure that you’re meeting academic
requirements and treat your»un-
dergrad years like checking off a
box. Students often walk blindly
out of advising appointments”
believing that they’re following

____._...I_’_...I.__I._\T____._I...QNS

Q

the right track when they should

realistically be doing much more

with their time during under-

grad. This tactic might work for
a student who plans on pursuing
postgraduate schooling, in which

case the goal is to create a good

resume and scores for another
application process, but if you’re

not in the expensive postgraduate

safety net, you’re placing yourself
in murky waters.

The reality is that students
should be asking many more
questions during these advising‘
appointments — something that
upperclassmen soon learn to envy
about freshmen and sophomores
with ample time left in their un-
dergraduate careers. Patrick Alt-
dorfer, apolitical science adviser
and professor at Pitt, emphasized

this-aspect of advising appoint-
ments when asked about how
to gain a well-rounded advising
experience. ' ‘ A
“We’re trained to give students
academic advice, and yes, the No.

1_ priority is academics. But at’

the end of _our meetings we ask if
there’s_ anything else. If the stu-
dent has nothing to ask, then the
meeting is over,” Altdorfer said.
For students who still have
several advising appointments
left, remember this “is there any-’
thing else?” portion. The beneﬁts
of good advisingrequire the focus
and goals of theeindividual stu-
dent, which are necessary if he
or she wants anything other than
basic academic advice. Advisers
have many resources they are
willing to provide to students, but

Students must be proactive in building resume undergraduates

it is up to the student to request
this type of advising. The prob-
lem isn’t a lack of resources for
‘practical experience, but rather
that students assume advisers
will openly provide and stress this
importance As a result, many stu-
dents make the mistake of solely
focusing on ﬁnishing their majors
and “rounding out’’- their resumes
by joining student organizations
during time that could be spent
more eﬂiciently.

“Undergrad is not so much

about learning and ‘discover-

ing’.yourself as it is about gain-
ing practical work experience
_while your cost of living is very
inexpensive,” said a Pitt gradu-
ate from 2013, who asked to re-

main anonymous because of employment
reasons. Her gap—year—then-law—school
plans had changed after leaving the haze
of undergrad safety, which forced her to
pursue an unexpected path for which she
wasn’t exactlypprepared.

“It’s always important to have a backup
plan. Grad school is not apermanent ﬁxture
in every hopeful lawyer-doctor’s life, and

when you declare yourself ‘prelaw’ or ‘pre-
med,’ professors should be more realistic
about it. Ask yourself, “If this falls through,
do I have enough practical experience in my
held to get a job that I will enjoy?”’

' The eye—opening aspect of this case
is that this former student devoted her
time to exactly what was asked of her by
her adviser: checkmarking the general
suggestions of a high GPA, research and
time— consuming extracurricular activities.
Onpaper, she had all the credentials of a
successful graduate who overcame chal-

lenges during her college career. But her
lack of professional networking and work
skills landed her in a demanding job that
she didn’t have the experience to approach
correctly.

“A reality of postgrad life is a feeling
of desperation. Buzzfeed articles make it
seem cute, but unfortunately, the job hunt
led to my not asking enough questions of
my future employers and quickly accepting
a. job that came my way.

..“Always make a point to get the full story
on the position and what it entails because

many managers will take advantage of re-
cent grads who haven’t learned the ropes
and pile on unexpected responsibilities
and hours.”

She notes that although outside experi-
ence is avital part of the undergraduate
career, you cannot rely on undergraduate
advisers to truly stress this importance.
The practical aspect of an undergraduate
career is something that she had to ﬁgure
out on her own.

Pitt’s wrestling team had a new slate of
opponents this year and a number of new
faces on its roster, but the team’s win-loss
record is something the team’s seniors are
used to at this point.

Over the previous four seasons, Pitt
wrestling has won its conference, the East-
ern Wrestling League, six times — three

regular-season and three tournament W

championships. But on Friday, -the N o. 6
Panthers became the ﬁrst Pitt team to win a

  SPORTS

Panthers capitalize on first ACC season, earn league title

share of the Atlantic Coast Conference title
by defeating no. 16 Virginia Tech 19-14. The
team can clinch the outright title Feb. 22
if it defeats North Carolina, a matchup in
which the Panthers are heavily favored. '

“To accomplish a team goal and make
history at the same time is something that
I’ll never forget,” senior Shelton Mack said.

The Panthers pounced on the Hokies
early by winning the ﬁrst three matches
and taking a 9-0 lead with wins by redshirt
senior Anthony Zanetta, No. 20 Mack and
freshman No. 17 Edgar Bright.

Virginia Tech countered with three wins .

of its own, including a technical fall at 157

pounds, which led to an 11-9 Virginia Tech

lead with four matches remaining.
Luckily for the Panthers, three ranked

‘ wrestlers awaited at the next weight class

to right the ship and secure the champi-
onship. ‘

No. 7 Tyler Wilps, a redshirt junior,-

earned a major decision, 13-3, putting

Pitt up 13-11 -—’ a lead the Panthers would

relinquish.

No. 6 Max Thomusseit and redshirt
sophomore No. 18 Nick Bonaccorsi each
picked up decisions over ranked wrestlers

to push the Panthers toward their eventual
total of 19 points.

Pitt lost the heavyweight bout because
senior P.J. Tasser sat out with the match no
longer in question and Pitt’s Mike Gregory
lost by a 12-10 decision. '

For the upperclassmen who have pre-
viously seen success, getting this win and
making Pitt history has a special meaning.

_“Securing the ﬁrst-ever ACC title has
a better feeling of accomplishment more

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Patterson hampered by injury in

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

With about nine minutes remaining
in Pitt’s game Sunday against Virginia
Tech, Lamar Patterson, his right hand
braced by a spiral of white athletic tape
running up to and around the knuckle
of his thumb, hoisted the ball above
his head with his elbows slightly bent.

Patterson’s thumb hadn’t been re-
ported as injured, and the tape hadn’t
been seen before, but he looked familiar
in that moment. He stood as statuesque
as a lighthouse, the basketball swiveling
back and forth brieﬂy until it illumi-
nated the open part of the court.

“There is something going on with
[my thumb],” Patterson said after the
game. “I hurt it in the last game, but I am
trying to get it straightened out now.”

But then he broke his form and riﬂed
a pass to Talib Zanna, waitingjust un-
der the basket, for an easy kiss off the
glass. It was Zanna’s ﬁrst basket of the
afternoon.

On Pitt’s next possession, Patterson
was open for a 3—pointerjust ahead of
the left corner.

Once he collected the pass and bent
his legs to prepare for the jump, the

Oakland Zoo paused in anticipation,
preparing for the eruption of cheers
that follows a three. With or without the

athletic tape on Patterson’s hand, the

crowd witnessed thescene frequently
all season.

Since Patterson had already show-
cased his ever-broadening skillset with
the overhead bullet to Zanna, and since
the fifth—year senior forward was mak-
ing threes on almost 43 percent of his
attempts, why shouldn’t they have ex-
pected a wide—open swish?

Because this was Patterson’s first
shot attempt of the matinee, it wasn’t
strange that he missed as he adjusted
to the flow of Saturday’s game. It was
how he couldn’t connect when left alone
as though he were simply shooting a
warm—up jumper. The ball hit the back
of the rim and bounced off almost as
high as ithad approached the basket.

The concerned crowd bellowed col-
lectively.

But Patterson was back at it on the
Panthers’ next possession, again with no
obstructions to his traditionally sound
3-point shooting. Now he was ﬁring
from the right elbow, but the result was

worse. The ball didn’t even hit the rim,
instead, tvhudding off the lower left cor-
ner of the square on the backboard.
- This time you could hear Patterson’s
concerned, almost exhausted exhale.
Then, Virginia Tech — the worst
team in the ACC, with just_ a single win
against Miami in overtime —— quickly

team,” Zanetta said. ,
It should come as no surprise that Pitt
has taken so quickly to the ACC, given the

success it had previously and the lofty goals ‘

set by the wrestlers themselves.

conference championship is only a small

accomplishment of what we really desire,” . h

The next shot from Patterson, who
earlier in the week led Pitt to an over-
time victory at Miami with 25 points,
was another airballed 3-pointer. It
would be his last attempt of the opening
half, in which he ﬁnished having missed
all threelof his shots in i8 minutes.

Although his shooting touch was
off, his passing vision never faltered,
and he collected ﬁve assists, suggesting
the taped thumb affected his shooting
hand. He was the same multi—skilled
player, but something was off. ’

Of more concern, though, was the
fact that the lowly Hokies remained
within a point, 27-26,at “halftime.

Patterson re-emerged from the
break with a clean right hand, which
was noticeably swollen. ‘

“I took the wrap off because it was
uncomfortable and a little too tight,” he
said. “There ‘is nothing to worry about.
I knew I was going to play in this game.”

He was playing, but still missing, off
the mark on three second—half attempts
and pointless through regulation. And

yetPitt head coachjamie Dixon left him
in the action.

“I thought he did a good job with
some good things defensively,” Dixon
said. “He came up with a couple of
steals. His help with defense was good
down the stretch. We tried to get him
rest, and we tried to get him going, but
you’re not going to have your best game
every night.”
