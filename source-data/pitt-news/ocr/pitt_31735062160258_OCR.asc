WASHINGTON AP--The State
Department began weighing today
the sensitive question of recogni-
tion of the new military junta in
Chile that has ousted the regime of
leftist President Salvador Allende.

Diplomatic, observers said they
expected Washington, anticipating
charges that it was responsible for
the coup, would allow a decent
interval before conferring recogni-
tion to avoid too close an initial
identification with the ﬂedgling

junta.

But the official view here was
that the future long-term relation-
ship between Washington and
Santiago will be based largely on
how the new government goes
about building a political and social
consensus on which to build an
orderly economic reconstruction
program.

Shortly after Allende took office,
U.S. bilateral lending to Chile dried
up as did financial assistance from
the World Bank and the Inter-
american Development Bank both
of which are under heavy American
inﬂuence.

The uncompensated nationaliza-
tion of U.S. copper mining interests
was listed as a reason for the

assistance cutoff, but Chile also
had developed a reputation for
inept economic management.
One official said that the
economic situation under Allende
was such that even the Soviet

Union declined to provide more V

than token assistance. Chile’s
inﬂation rate over the past year has
reached an estimated 300 per cent,
the highest in the world.

Despite a general deterioration
in relations between the two
countries over the past three years,
ties between their respective
military establishments appear to
have ﬂourished.

The United States -has continued
to train Chilean military officers,
and the U.S. and Chilean navies
have maintained their program of
annual joint maneuvers off the
Chilean coast.

This year’s exercises were
scheduled to begin Tuesday morn-
ing but were called off after word of
the military takeover reached
Washington. To avoid a diplomatic
incident, the four American vessels
involved were ordered to change
course and not to penetrate the
200-mile maritime limit over which
Chile claims jurisdiction.

Blacks’ needs——top priority

Black Action Society (BAS), Joni
(Namosha) Smith, spoke out
yesterday against Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosen-

berg’s authority to appoint the"
chairman of the Black Studies
Department.

“One person should not be

allmred to make decisions that

affect an entire department,”
Smith said. “The department
faculty should have been con-
sulted.”

Smith expressed concern over
the recent controversy over the
appointment by Dean Rosenberg of
Dr. Fela Sowande as Black Studies
acting chairman over faculty-

“Sowande is not attuned to the
problems of the department and
would not help it grow. Neither
Fela nor Curtiss could bring the
necessary cohesiveness to the
department to insure its survival.
The Dean should have been more

considerate of people in the
department.
“This situation is another

example of efforts to squash social
movements by autonomous deci-
sion makers.”

Smith has faith that the Black
Studies Department will continue
to grow despite the chairmanship
controversy. “The department did
not disintegrate from the turmoil,”
she said. “It’s experiencing
growing pains. There is a history
of black departments becoming
phased out across the country for
lack of money, but our department
continues to offer a strong,
innovative program. We will lobby
for more funds to offer more
subjects.”

BAS Chairman William Kilson
added, “Black departments and
programs are not high on the
priority lists of universities and
state agencies that provide much of
the money for education. But our
department has stablized and is
operating normally.” ’

Turning to BAS’ plans for this
year, Kilson said his primary goal

..is to help institute the forming of

small interest groups within BAS to
deal more directly with the
personal interests of black students

BY LARRY PAN SINO

An Alternative security system
to the 1 a.m. restriction on
admission of non-residents to
dormitories was proposed Wed-
nesday to Chancellor,Wesley W.
Posver and Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs Alfred L. Moye by
Student Government President
Regis Kaufman. Kaufman made
the proposal at a meeting of the

Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee (SAAC) meeting.

The proposed system eliminated
the 1 a.m. rule and substituted an
entry-escort procedure. Under this
proposal, between 1 a.m. and 7
a.m. the host resident would
identify and sign in all guests with
the dorm desk attendants. The
resident would also assume re-
sponsibility for the actions of his
visitiors. ~

Rege Kaufman

BAS Goals

plained, “voter registration drives,
dance groups, a big sister program

students, and chess clubs are all
possibilities. We can provide

funds.

“We also want to work with
issues that affect students’ daily
lives, such as unnecessary security
procedures in the dorms and the $5
drop/ add fee.

“And we are planning a foreign
studies program.”

Smith discussed what BAS
planned in cultural and social
events. “We will work with balck
departments such as Black Studies,
to stage educational programs. For
example, we are considering rap

( Continued on Page 2). .  I

Kaufman said he formulated the
alternative proposal after 445
students signed a Student Govern-
ment (SG) petition opposing the 1
a.m. restriction.

“It took us less than one day to
accumulate the signatures, and
most of the signers are dorm
residents,” Kaufman said.

Dr. Moye gave Kaufman assur-
ance that the proposal would be
decided upon within one week.

Kaufman read an prepared
statement articulating the rea-
soning behing SG’s opposition to
the 1 a.m. rule. “We feel it is a
restrictive and discriminatory de-
cision. Students are being
penalized for the past failures of
the desk attendants to do their jobs
and keep out tresspassers. Since
these attendants are University
employees, the University is at
fault.

“Our educational experience
here should have an open,
free-ﬂowing philosophical atmos-
phere. The 1 a.m. rule restricts the
ﬂow of people and ideas. Does the
administration want its students to
be manipulated and deceived or to
develop in an open environment?

“And why was the decision
made during the summer when
very few students were around to
offer suggestions or oppose it?”

Chancellor Posvar answered
“The situation presented an
urgency for common safety that
outweighed considerations of stu-
dent imput. We had to get the
security system planned during the
summer so it could be implemented
in the fall.

“The physical safety of the
students is more important than
petition or student opposition. Dr.
Moye and I are responsible for
injury to our residents and are
aware of the seriousness of the
problem. We have seen the results
of injury and dealt with parents.
Under such circumstances, I feel I
have a moral duty to be
autocratic.”

Moye added “The, desk atten-
dants are not totally at fault in the
failure of former systems.
Students must cooperate. Iknow of
much hasseling of attendants at
Towers A and B, which contributed
to their being removed.

“Student Government has taken
a responsible position on this issue.

However, I don’t believe asking
residents to adhere to the 1 a.m.
rule is restricting their education.”

Sharon Sexton, editor-in-chief of
The Pitt News, asked why the time
of 1 a.m. was chosen. Dr. Moye
responded, “1 a.m. beats the
crowd coming out of local bars and
off the streets. It is an arbitrary but
reasonable hour.” a

Sexton then asked, “Why was no
distinction made between non-
resident students and people not
enrolled at all?”

“That
against guests who are not
students,” Dr. Moye said. “An

Beef Increase Possible,

Agriculture Dept. Says

WASHINGTON AP -- More
beef soon may be headed toward
consumer dinner tables, according
to a new feedlot inventory of cattle
by the Agriculture Department.

As of Sept. 1, the department
said Thursday, cattle being fat-
tened for slaughter in seven
important beef states totaled more
than 9.1 million head, up 6 per cent
from a year earlier.

The Sept. 1 count, however, was
up only slightly from a month
previous. During August, the
report said, sales from the
fattening pens dropped 20 per
cent from a year earlier._

That was during the price lid on
retail and wholesale beef prices
which was removed earlier this
week.

The report provided further
evidence that cattle were held back
from slaughter longer than usual.
During August cattle which were
sold averaged up to 39 pounds
heavier in weight than a year
earlier.

The department said the average
price for slaughter steers at major
markets in August was $52.86 per
100 pounds of liver weight, up
$18.16 from a year ago and $5.43
above the July average.

Apathy Strikes Again

Turnout at Tenant Union Seminar Extremely Poor

 

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

A student tenant seminar,
convoked to familiarize off-campus
residents with their protective
rights and responsibilities, failed to
elicit much response from the Pitt
community.

The colloquium, co-ordinated by
the Pitt Tenant Union, volunteered
the expertise of officials from the
Sheriff’s Department, Board of
Health, Bureau of Building Inspec-
tions, and the Union’s attorneys on
retainer.

Despite the array of empty seats,
the administrative guests showed
an eagerness to address them-

' selves to all the questions which

arose. Thomas Trimm, a Tenant
Union attorney, delineated some of
the concerns which preoccupy the
legal staff’s attention.

Kilson, Smith

“A major problem for students
has been getting security deposits
back from the landlords at the end
of the lease,” Trimm observed.
“There are a number of landlords
who are unscrupulous with their
damage deposit practices. They
disguise the deposits as ‘gravy’
items, but never intend to refund
them when the lease expires.”

Trimm emphasized that students
must understand every provision in
the lease before affixing their
signature. “Often, the lease
stipulates that should the property
be sold, tenants can be evicted
within 30 or 60 days. Too many
people overlook these kinds of
things,” he asserted.

Anthony Ovesny, chief of the
Housing Section for the Allegheny
County Health Department, critic-
ized the University’s off-campus
housing policies.

sessions on important social issues
such as relationship between men
and women, African liberation
struggles, and life for a black
student in a white university.

‘‘In order to provide something
to do, we will sponsor dances,
coffee houses, informal parties and
work with Student Government on
Lecture series and mass appeal,
entertainment for white and black

students.

“White students’ views of BAS’

as an exclusively black organization
are a problem. We do not exclude
whites from our activities, and
White students should make a
conscious effort to check into our
programs. BAS tries to provide
black students the opportunity to
grow and exercise their abilities.
We are not anti—white but are
pro-black.”

“The University can be faulted
for not having am‘. approved list of
residences that are fit to inhabit.
The Univesity’s ability to quality
apartments as approved or non-
approved could provide invaluable
assistance to students searching for
a decent home,” Ovesney charged.

He also deplored student prac-
tices of merely considering price
and proximity when re-locating for
the fall.

“lnstead of pausing to compile a
list of their quarters’ shortcomings
and confronting the landlord with
them, they simply look at the price
and the distance,” Ovesney lamen-
ted. “We've had instances of
people leasing a $300 per month
apartment that’s missing a window
in the bedroom!”

health administrator for the central
district, disclosed that gross

Dr. Whitman Returns
to U.S. Economics Dept.

BY FELICE NEWMAN

Pitt’s Dr. Marina Whitman has
left the President’s Council of
Economic Advisors to return to the
Economics Department.

In 1971 Richard Nixon appointed
Whitman to the Price Commission,
a seven-member board which
makes guidelines for price contrui.
She was the first woman to be
named to full Council membership.

Discussing President Nixon’s
economic policy, Dr. Whitman
said, “I think that what happened
was that we had wage-price
controls tailored to certain econo-
mic conditions. Phase III was a
mistake. Pressure ammounted on
the President to ‘do something.’
So, the President decided that he
had to impose a freeze as a way of
moving back to stricter controls.

“The danger we all saw was that
we’d ﬁnd ourselves trying to use
these controls under conditions
that weren’t appropriate. This is a
problem that could have been
predicted. ’ ’

To answer the question of
whether wage-price controls are an
aid to our economy, Whitman said,
“Are we better off? I don’t know.
My guess is that we’re somewhat
better off than without controls.”

Whitman said she accepted the
President’s offer for the “challenge
of being able to practice my
profession.” She noted that
doctors and lawyers are always
involved in the practice of their
professions, while in economics
“very seldom do you get to try to
make it work in the real world.”

Whitman announced her Council
resignation in June.

overcrowding has been a principal
irritant with housing officials.

Both Ovesney and Davis con-
ceded that it requires “a courage-
ous individual” to file a complaint
about any housing deﬁciency that
may exist. Most students waver
under the possibility of engen-
dering the landlord’s hostility, and
hence, the number of complaints
which their office has handled has
been few.

Lieutenant Joseph Blazevich, a
deputy in the Sheriff’s Department
outlined the procedures involved in
anxeviction. “Every lease should
contain a provision, insuring the
tenant with a reasonable time
period for vacating the premises.
Our job is to serve the order, giving
the party either a 72-hour or 10-day
notice, whichever is applicable,”
Blazevich explained.

“Our job can also be one of
arbitration,” he noted. “If, for
practical considerations, a student
is unable to comply with an order,
then an arrangement is hammered
out, whereby both parties are
presented with new terms that will
facilitate a normal departure.
However, if a student adopts an
intractable posture, then it is the
sheriff’s duty to implement force.

Edward J. Miller, a code
enforcement administrator with the
Building Inspections division,
enumerated the most common
forms of violations with respect to
the various city codes for apart-
ment buildings.

The Tuck Shop-A cut above the others

What Price Hamburger?

BY GEORGE ZRUST

With the re-opening on Tuesday,
September 11, of the Student
Union's Hunt Room, The Pitt News
learned that a hamburger cost 10
cents less at the Student Union
facility than at the Cathedral of
Learning’s Tuck Shop.

Both the Tuck Shop and the Hunt
Room are operated by Szabo Food
Service.

A subsequent investigation re-
vealed that Szabo’s Scaife Hall
cafeteria was also charging only 35
cents for the hamburger.

The Tuck Shop hot dog costs 45
cents, also 10 cents higher than at
the Student Union and Scaife Hall
food facilities.

When the Pitt News pointed out
the higher price to Tuck Shop
manager Ida Emery, the menu was
changed immediately to show 35
cents for the hamburger.

Emery explained that during the
summer the Tuck Shop had begun
using pre-seasoned, “charcoaled”
hamburger patties, resulting in the
45 cents price beginning Septem-
ber 4.

Emery attributed the higher
priced hot dog to the use of a more
expensive bun. The hot dog and
roll is also grilled while the others
serve boiled weiner on an
untoasted roll.

However, according to Tom
Albert, Director of Food Services
for the University, the price was
ordered rolled back the same day.

A Tuck Shop cashier said that
she had been charging only 35

cents since the rollback.

Szabo District Manager Kie
Haghighi reaffirmed that the
hamburger was different brand
than that used at the Union and
Scaife.

He added that the 45 cents price
was also due to the larger size of
the Tuck Shop burger.

This statement, though, was
later.contradicted by Szabo Re-
gional Operations Manager Wayne

inconvenience some people.”

Sexton replied, “Yes, but the
better system would be the one
which inconveniences the least
number of people.” Sexton added,
“It was a serious mistake not
consider student opinion in pro-
ducing the security plan.”

Posvar said that $35,000 was
procured to ﬁnance the hiring of
detectives to serve as desk
attendants between 8 p.m. and 7
a.m. The detectives will probably
begin service by the middle of next
week, when contract problems with
the detective agency are expected
to be ironed out.

Moving to other matters on the
agenda, Kaufman protested Uni-
versity plans to charge 25 cents for
a time schedule for class registra-
tion. SG board members Susan
Ruffner said free time schedules
are a University ‘service that
students deserve.

Chancellor Posvar cited wasteful
student use of time schedules, the
financial squeeze the University is
experiencing. and Pitt’s need for
increased income as reasons for the
planned fee.

Again SAAC members Kaufman
and Sexton objected to the
exclusion of student input in
administrative decisions which
directly affect students.

Next on the agenda was the topic
of food service participation in the
boycott of lettuce picked by
Teamsters Union workers in
California and Arizona. The
present policy is to serve United
Farm Workers [UFW] lettuce when
available; UFW-approved Mich-
igan and local lettuce when not,
and otherwise Teamsters lettuce
when no other could be procured.

SAAC recognized that they have
no legal right to force students to
support the boycott and resolved to
take a referendum to the resident
student population and examine
the results before acting further.

The Chancellor remarked, ‘‘I
support the UFW on this matter to
the legal extent."

Finally, the Committee inquired
of any University decision to
purchase and renovate two build-
ings on Oakland Avenue for future
student cooperative housing.

“These homes are in really bad
shape," Dr. Moye said. “We’re

not sure if they're worth the
investment.”
Chancellor Posvar added,

4“Criminal gangs have broken into
the vacant buildings (at 217 and
235 Oakland Ave.) and stripped
them of plumbing. wiring and
carpeting. It would cost more to
renovate these structures than to
build new ones."

The African heritage of black
Americans will soon be repre-
sented in a new Nationality room in
the Cathedral of Learning.

Walter C. Worthington, co-
founder of the Western Penn-
sylvania Research & Historical

Society, is chairman of a committee
of community leaders that met this
summer to formulate plans for the
projected room.

The African Heritage room is the
most recent of two room commit-
tees formed since the completion of
the Irish Room in 1957. Another
committee has been formulating a
design for an Israel room.

The proposed rooms will up—date

classrooms.

no differences in the brand of

in both Houses. It is expected that it will be quickly signed by Mr.
Nixon, well-known for his interest in sports in general, football in
particular, and the Washington Redskins specifically.

After so many months of antagonism between the President and
Congress it is heartening to see that we are finally getting “back to the

business of running the country.”

In the President’s Watergate message he admonished the press for
“leering and sneering” at his administration and its policies.

Sometimes it is damn hard not to.

The government is in serious trouble when the4President and the
Congress can only concur over issues such as football. .

This week the President vetoed a much -needed medical care
emergency bill. The House sustained that veto.

Mr. Nixon must be joking if he thinks that the United States
Congress, in dealing successfully with such frivilous issues as football,
is “doing the job it was elected to do” or dealing with matters of vital

interest to this country.

The President is correct when he says that we must begin to deal
seriously with the needs of our country and the business of running the
government. Now is the time for Congress and President to stop
playing politics and begin to deal seriously with issues which seriously

A couple of days ago, signs appeared at the
entrances to the Cathedral of Leaning. They were
neatly printed, in white letters on a black cardboard
background. I do not recall the exact wording, but
they suggested that it was illegal to take dogs or .

bicycles into the building.

lwas going to copy down the exact wording today,
but the signs had vanished. The University was a
victim of its own rules; the signs had been affixed
with tubes of masking tape, sticky side out, the only
legal adhesive in all the witdth and length of Pitt.

The reason the signs are priceless is that those I
saw were, without exception, attached along side

this year, when a series of six drawings of Pittsburgh

scenes was featured on the backs of_ the twelve-ounce
cans. One represented the Cathedral of Learning,
but on such a small scale that no details were visible.

signs, I would gladly buy him a glass of beer. He
must have led a miraculously sheltered life up there
in the upper reaches of the Tower. It must not have
occurred to him that there is only one thing in the
world which is more difficult to get through a
revolving door than a bicycle, and that is a dog. It is
even worse if the dog is on a leash.

If these signs reflect policy, as they surely must,
they will surely be replaced. I suggest that the
replacements be more complete, and forbid riding
horseback through the revolving doors as well.

A new literary form has been invented by a local
brewery. The cans and bottles in which its beer is
sold have lately been decorated with pictures,sports
schedules, and even sports questions on the labels,
with answers supplied on the backs of the labels.

(1 know very well that there is only one brewery left
in the city. I have called it a “a local brewery” in
order to avoid mentioning its name. Mentioning its

limericks, and they could print the very best, as there
would be no censorship problem. The contents of the
cans would keep offensive material out of the hands
of minors.

Short stories would be nice, but they would have to
be very short to ﬁt on a can. Of course, they could be
serialized, with every six-pack guaranteed to contain
all six episodes of a single story. Longer works would
occupy a whole case; “War and Peace” would
probably cover a truckload.

I think the idea is brilliant, and I can hardly wait to
read my way through a lot of suds.

beer cans and bottles as anyone without cirrhosis,
has just told me something‘ which lowers my hopes.
He thought the labels with the questions were great,
until he bought a whole case of beer. Each bottle of
the two dozen had the same question on it. This

First, I object to the loss of a

A freedom I had last year here at Pitt.

Curfews are not for the university
to inﬂict on its students. Marian E.
Hirst was quoted in the September
10, 1973 issue of The Pitt News as
saying, “We feel that 1 o’clock is a
reasonable hour for students to be

S in the dorms.” Are we adults able

to decide for ourselves, or are we
still children??!!

Secondly, it assumes that Pitt
students can’t be some of the cause
of the security problem on campus.
Aren’t Pitt students just as capable

 

as any outsiders

residents from other dorms is
completely illogical.

, Thirdly, Marian E. Hirst was
quoted in the same article as
saying, “This (security measures)
is not the business of Student
Government, lntrafraternity Coun-
cil or Panhellenic‘ Council.” I
should think at least two of the
three groups would be up in anger
at such a statement. Isn’t Student
Government our general represen-
tationsat Pitt? Are they in reality
just push-overs for any administra-
tive action labeled “necessary” by
such non-elected , non-student
administrators as in Residence Life

Finally, why is it so difficult to

enforce the system of checking I.D.
cards before admittance to dorms?

If such a system is now being used
to check for Pitt residents to gain
admittance after 1 a.m., why can’t
a properly identified non-resident
also be admitted--the same system
can be used! By a. “properly

person who is admitted after being

a Pitt resident to allow them
entrance. Where would the
“serious security problem” be
then??!!

Everything I have heard from
resident students about the 1 a.m.
curfew has been opposition and an
urge to search for alternatives in
the security measures. I strongly
suggest that all resident students
write to The Pitt News and/ or the
Office of. Student Affairs (Dr.
Alfred Moye) and voice their
opinions on this restriction. There
can be “security” without restric-
tions on the rights of the residents.
I hope many students voice their
concern with me and are willing to
help solve this problem in way that
is fair and agreeable to all.

Abortion

Dear Editor:

For those women who may have
been frightened by the letter from
James Buzonas ‘concerning the
medical aspects of abortion, let it
be said that all the latest facts on
the subject are available in Falk

.Medical Library and they prove

Mr. Buzonas to be wrong. For a
better understanding of the British
experience with abortion, some
may want to consult page 9 of
Family Planning Perspectives for
October, 1971. A much more
extensive review is avialable in
other journals. Also let it be
mentioned that there is absolutely
no evidence to support ‘Mr.
Buzonas’ claims of increased
sterility, prematurity, etc. His lack
of knowledge is clearly shown when
he mentioned the possibility of
Rh-sensitization may be a problem,

LETTER POLICY’

 

The PITT NEWS welcomes
letters from all of its readers
on any subject which may in-
terest them. There is no other
way for the editorial page to
reflect the various opinions of
the University.

Letters to the PITT NEWS
should be typed and must be
signed, but we will withhold

the identities of writers who
wish to remain anonymous.

Relatively short letters have
the best chance of publica-
tion; when it is necessary to
edit a letter it will be done to
conserve space, not to alter
the opinion of the writer.

Rh-sensitization would occur in
susceptible women when they
carried their pregnancy to term, yet
James does ' not advocate that
childbirth be halted for this reason.
Loyal readers of the Pitt News
may recall the dialogue which Mr.
Buzonas and I conducted in these
pages last year on this subject.
This year, I will not subject the
readers to a continuation of this
debate. Besides, a newspaper is
hardly the place to have an

Dear Editor:

I am taking the time to write this
message hoping that you will
publish it and therefore communi-
cate it to other students in my
situation. . . . .particularly FEMALE
BICYCLISTS.

After one week of classes, I am
about ready to give up bicycling to
school. Not because riding a bike
in Oakland traffic is dangerous, but
because of certain MALE motor-
ists and MALE pedestrians are
making life hard me. For example,
everytime I ride down Forbes
Avenue some male motorists honks
his horn and yells “hey girlie, use
your turn signals.” But when I

do stick out my arm to show which
way I’m going, I get jeers and yells_
from certain male pedestrians.

Like the jerks who hang out in front

of Roy Rogers. I always stop at red
lights and I try to be considerate of
motorists, for my own sake more
than anything but everyday some
guy pulls out in front of me and
makes a right turn without
signalling.

I feel that I’m getting these tricks
played on me not just because I’m
on a bike but also because I’m
female. My male biking friend
says he never gets hassles -and he
even runs the red light!!

Why Why Why can't I bike in
peace? '

I’ll continue to ride because it
saves me money and save the
country gas and all the pollution
that goes with it. And I really enjoy
the feeling of wind in my hair and
feeling my muscles moving. Are
there any other women in my
situation?

Tell me what should I do?

comedy that made its mark upon
the Italian Renaissance Theatre

Life in the Test Tube

BY KARL BALDYS

“From time to time,” said Dr.
Kelser, “as I mentioned last time,
we will have visual aids, speakers,
etc. Today we are fortunate to have
with us a great man. The world’s
foremost authority, Professor Irwin
Corey.”

The distinguished visiting pro-
fessor, in a turtle neck sweater,
brown sport jacket and matching
H.I.S. slacks, walked to the
podium. “I feel it is incumbent on
this discussion that, regardless of
what would appear to be the
similarities and differences of these
two cultures (pointing to chart),
that we ask ourselves, ‘Why?”

“With the value of the commod-
ity therein derives the price. As
Marx said, 5We must eliminate the
private ownership of property.
Because, what really matters is the
personal ownership of property/
and we should all remember
that/becausethat is the reason why
the private ownership of property is
so odius to us all/these private
people are screwing the whole
thing up.”

“Take beef for example. There
is a commodity whose value is
lower than its price. and yet,
people say, ‘‘I have no beef with
Nixon.” ‘

Professor Irwin Corey has been
delivering such lectures for over
thirty years. He has given them in
every major night club and theater
from New York to San Francisco
and is universally known as the
man who has the answer to

everything but never aswers,

anything--the crazy professor.
“It is said today that life can be
made in the test tube. This is a

  

great moment. But, there are
many dangers involved with
artificial reproduction of the
species. President Nixon himself is
a product of artificial insemination,
and thereinour first example.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.”

“You may ask, what relation
does this have to the the
geographically underpriviledged
society--Nothing! After all, land is
the basis of all wealth. Without
land there is nothing. And
President Lincoln was aware of
this. In his great speech of 1864, or
1863, or 1865, in his Emancipation
Declamation, Proclamation, the
President of the United States
purported what was a mere
subtrefuge. Some Black disc
jockeys in New York have not been
deceived, however, and between
the jive are beginning to call
themselves men.”

The class was surprised and
entertained. As Professor Corey
and his hosts from the Student

Union Board sat down to dinner I
asked him if he was equally
satisﬁed.

Q: What did you think of the
audience? ,

Corey: Well, they laughed. But,
they were a captive audience.

Q: I understand you're
disappointed by many female
comediennes? Don't you think
that’s unfair?

Corey: No. All they do is trash.
The woman comedians of today all
stink? You don’t think so?

Q: What about Carol Burnett,
Phyliss Diller?

Corey: Those are two of the
worst. What are they doing for
women? They’re all ass-kissers.
Their just playing it for what it’s

The Special Activities for this term will be announced in The
Wednesday, September ‘I2, at 6:30 p.m., a Mass, buffet, and

worth.

Q: Are you against women's
liberation?

Corey: I didn’t say that. I saw
Bill Buckley debate Germaine
Greer. She cut him up. She’s a
great person. Her, and Gloria
Steinem. They’re doing some-
thing.

Q: You do a lot of racial jokes.
Do you... .

Corey: I don’t do any racial
jokes. I don’t do jokes.

Q: You do a lot of political stuff.
What do you think about Nixon?

Corey: He’s no good. I hate to
say more about that.

Q: You said in your lecture “We
don’t know what the hell life is...

Corey: Life is chaos. To be an
artist is to be a rebel, a person who
thrives on chaos. That’s why when
people talk to me about John
Wayne and Bob Hope as actors I
tell them these people aren’t
artists.”

Q: Certainly you’ve met these
people. What is your personal
impression? ‘

Corey: A chunk of vomit. Those
guys, Hope and John Wayne, who
never had a uniform on in their
lives, tell us to send our boys to
Vietnam to get killed. That’s a
hunk of vomit.

Corey was a surprise more than
once in the evening. I found myself
more excited about his personal
views than his act. Perhaps, that
was because his act never seemed
to end. When he was off stage he
was merely toned down.

He expressed an admiration for
Salvador Allende, saying that his
big mistake was in not destroying
the system that elected him, and in
not destroying the army. “Why

does Chile need an army?” he said.

Corey refused the traditional
before dinner cocktail saying “It
dulls my act." But he didn’t
refrain from harrassing the wait-
ress just a bit. “The crabs are
good, huh? What, have they been
around for two weeks? This is blue
cheese? Tastes like mayonaise. A
little cream in my coffee, if it’s not
too much trouble, darling--
miserable bitch!” At times his
New York accent and his rough
taxi-driver approach was con-
fusing.

Corey: This society is decadent.
Actor, actress. Where is there ever
mentioned actress in Shakespere’s
theatre? There were no women on

the stage.
Q: You're knocking women
again.

Corey: Why? Actor is not male
either. This society is full of
Georgie Jessel, Paul
Lynde, Dom DeLuise. There's a
fag. Did you know Raymond Burr
was a fag? You wouldn’t know it by
the parts he plays but he has to
cover it up. There's nothing wrong
with lesbians or homosexuals.
They shouldn’t cover it up
though.”

BY PRESTON RIDGE

F. Scott Fitzgeratd’s The Great
Gatsby is currently being ﬁlmed by
Paramount pictures. With a
budget of about seven million
dollars and big name talent
including Mia Farrow and Robert
Redford, it is predicted to be one of
the biggest movies of our time.
Current fashions boasting the
Gatsby look, and a revival of ﬁlms
and books highlighting the roaring
twenties are all part of the fanfare
surrounding this upcoming ﬁlm.

Fire eaters, Previews

As the result of a lot of work and
even more luck I managed to be in
that movie.

Upon arriving in Rhode Island
this summer, I discovered that
Paramount had rented Rosecliff
castle for the ﬁlming of the three
party scenes crucial to the Gatsby
story. Rosecliff is one of the
grandest of the Newport mansions
and as such was perfectly suited for
creating the atmosphere of the
Gatsby Era. I also discovered that
Paramount was looking for extras
to be party guests. I decided to
audition, little knowing that about

and slides

eight thousand other people had
the same idea.

I made an appointment ﬁguring I
would have a private audition.
When I arrived there were people

everywhere. After what seemed to~

be an endless wait I was ushered
into a room with about sixty other
hopefuls.

Needless to say, as I took my seat
I was just a little bit neverous. Just
to be seen in this ﬁlm could count
as a deﬁnite plus in the area of a
career boost, but there were so
many people that the thought of
ever making it seemed impossible.
As my mind wandered in a
thousand different directions Ber-
nie Styles, Paramount’s casting
director, started talking to us about
what he was looking for. We were
individually asked to come up to his
desk. He looked and quickly
decided. I was one of the three he
said yes to.

We still had to face the big
director himself, Jack Clayton, for

Studio Theatre Holds First Meeting

BY CHARLES OGG

For the ﬁrst time I wandered into
the depths beneath the Cathedral.
Harbored there was an entire
enclave congregating under the
name “Studio Theater”.

“Go on in, there's food and drink
on the table,” a friendly face called
out. I was sent to cover a meeting,
and here was a large social
gathering. Expecting order to be
called at any moment I ventured
further into the room.

To my right stis an old broken-in
couch and a well worn chair, parts
of a set; I am standingin a theater.
In one corner a man swallows ﬁre.
Next to him ﬂash slides of previous
productions while 15 to 20 people
mill about.

From the ﬁrst conversation I
discover how these students have
invested there lives in this room.
“I come down here whenever I
have some spare time," is an
average comment. “Having a
common goal, and working to-
gether to achieve it is such a great
experience,” one of the newer
members conﬁdes to me.

 

‘ babysitting 8. minor chores.

The theater people have formed
what seems to be a close knit
family, yet'it is a family to be
broken up at the end of the year.
The only director of the crowd,
Layne Williams, graduates without
a replacement. This seems to be a
common trend, and these people
are desperate to initiate new
comrades into the clan. Next year
there will be many signiﬁcant
openings, and the time to start is
now.

‘One purpose of the “meeting”
was to attract fresh blood. Limited
funds limited advertising which
may have limited new faces. Those
that appeared were treated to
fascinating displays of the technical
aspects of performing, including
makeup, costuming, and guided
tours of the catwalks where lie
lights and sound. Then the lights
dimmed and a scene from “A Taste
of Honey” appeared.

The president of the Studio
Theater Board, J..I. Tierney .Ir.,
started a pre-med student. _Fervor

“The University Theater is the
only theater run solely by under-
graduates for undergraduates,
unlike the department which
involves mostly graduates and even
hires professionals,” J ..I. said.

Layne, the director, adds “Many
of us are theater majors and must
work with the department pro-
duction, limiting the amount of
time we can put in here. We
desperately need new people.”

“Many people put 200 hours a
term here, the actors giving more.
I sleep here because I live so far
away,” claimed the stage mana-

ger.

Never having had any tremen-
dous desire to work with the
theater I nevertheless found myself
agreeing to stop back again. I plan
to see “A Taste of Honey”. If
anyone else is interested be sure to
make reservations in advance, as it
will most certainly be sold out.

your curiosity they urge students to

THE STUDIO THEATRE‘ '

Friday, September 14, 1973——THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

Inside those Gatsby Parties

the ﬁnal O.K. One week from the
ﬁrst encounter I was led into
another room for the ﬁnal test.

Mr. Clayton came in, went to the
head of the room, and pointed to
those he wanted. God, how brutal,
I thought. A moment later all was
forgiven as he singled me out. I
had made it. Gatsby, Mia Farrow,
and the roaring twenties here I
come. After being hustled off to
wardrobe and fitted with a suit of
black tails and white tie, I drove
home anxiously awaiting the first
night’s filming.

Finally, that night arrived and
the fun began. First to wardrobe,
then make-up and then into the
buses that would take us to the set.
It was a wet misty night and

. Rosecliff, on the shore of Newport

seemed only to perfect as the home

of Gatsby. It was as mysterious

and unique as the‘ man.

We were led off the buses and
down to the tents which were to
serve as our nightly living quarters
for the next two weeks. Shortly
they called us for positions and off
we went to the set. I’ll not soon
forget the initial effect of walking
from a muddy garden path into the
grandeur of the Gatsby set. It was
then and there that I decided there
was a lot to be said for the magic of
the movies.

The next two weeks were spent
ﬁlming. I was in scenes with as few
as ten people and in some with as
many as ﬁve hundred. We even
spoke in one scene. The problem is
that with all the footage that is shot
one never know what will be used
and what will end up on the
cutting-room floor. I am anxious to
ﬁnd out.

Every experience was new and
different in its own way. Early on,
the troops of party guests had been

divided into two groups. Those
that were the background and a
smaller group that were positioned
around the camera - in the fore-
ground. Luckily I was in the
foreground group.

What I found truly amazing was
the endless amounts of money that
were being spent on the film. The
nightly Newport budget was fifty
thousand dollars. Most of the
costumes were original and as such
were in themselves worth thou-
sands of dollars. Even the food bill
was astronomical. Huge legs of
beef and lamb, and dozens of
lobsters all designed on tree
‘models decorated the tables. After
two weeks the poor lobsters had to
be disinfected before every scene
just to stop the smell. But even
through all that, they always looked
great.

The entire company was great to
work with without exception. In
fact, on the fourth of July the crew
staged a ﬁreworks display for the
beneﬁt of those who were working
and couldn’t celebrate in a more
conventional way.

I made one very big mistake.
One evening I agreed to do a dance
scene and it damn near killed me.
It required about twenty takes
which meant about ﬁve hours of
dancing the Charleston. I now
have a clear picture of what it
means to have sore feet. We really
earned out money that night!!

Meeting and working with so
many actors and actresses was in
itself an experience. Mia Farrow
was a delight; in every respect. In
fact everyone from the biggest star
to the smallest un-star worked like
hell to make these scenes the likes
of which have not been seen before
and may never be seen again. The
magic was there in Newport.

Traffic sits on top of ‘Donald Duck,
I somewhere between Swiss Family

Robinson and Deep Throat.

Heavy Traffic is a feature length
cartoon from the makers of Fritz
the Cat dealing quite bluntly with
the true life story of Ralph Bakshi.
Bakshi is director and author of
both Fritz and Traffic. Bakshi, just
like his character Michael in the
movie, was raised in the rough,
dirty, low life of New York City.
The picture drawn of this life is not
a pretty one Jews, blacks, the
Mafia, and cripples are all laughed
at and finally spat on. Scenes of
raw sex and bloody violence are
frequent and explicit.

Although I am sure the charac-
ters could be given stronger basic
traits, perhaps more effectively
defined, the early manhood of
Michael if strongly portrayed.

Michael, again like the early
Bakshi, keeps to his room and
draws cartoons day long, not

~. meeting any of the outer world’s

standards. As a crazy old black
man 7 tells Michael,
“We’s all niggers, boy, only some

’ 5 of us don’t know it yet.” Later, a

bustling black girl, Carole, be-
friends Michael, and through her
“talents,” they try to make it to the
big time.

A most impressive method of
switching between live action and
used consistently
throughout the movie. Paintings,
old movies, and scenes of New
York City are all used effectively,
making the total affect all the more
realistic. When the animation ends

and Bakshi brings us back to a real‘

Animation and Reality

life Carole and Michael, the impact
of realism on the viewer is moving
and powerful.

The movie as a whole is
promising and at the same time,
upsetting. It is comforting to know
that a man of Bakshi’s abilities has
fulfilled a neglected field, that is,
animation outside of the Disney
world. There are promising signs
in the construction of mood,
characterization, and presentation.
Social comments were many and of
quality. ,

My major complaint is with the

extreme number and grotesquen

ness of sexual acts. I trust that I
am not being Puritan in this
thinking, but if Bakshi would clean
up that which seems to be
unnecessary, I am positive that a
larger market could be reached.
Bakshi has said that he is upset
with the X-rating of both Fritz and
Traffic. But in reference to Traffic,
he hasn’t my sympathy on this
point.- One would be much less
distracted if the film was cleaned
up, so that the audience could
concentrate much more on social
themes and the quality of the
animation. Only when this is done,
do I believe that Bakshi’s com-
plaints ' are well founded. I
sincerely hope that his thinking
does change, for in Heavy Traffic
we see hope for a much greater
growth in the field of film.

feature this weekend. Eliot

Eliot Kappel is new to the coffee

songs for only four years, but about
four months ago he hit it big.

Kappel is a student at New York
University. As he put it, “I studied
acting at N.Y.U. until I was asked
to fill in one night between groups
at a concert. From then on I was a
songwriter.”

Kappel is currently writing songs
for an album which he is planning
to cut with Peer-Southem. Kappel
plays a mixture of his own work and
popular songs of the James Taylor
variety. Kappel said, “With my
music...l’m just trying to make
people thin .”

Kean Kimmel & Country are
bringing apart of the country to
Pitt this weekend. Songs like The
Tennessee Stud and I saw the

accompaniement of banjo and
fiddle, present a kind of entertain-
ment that is too infrequent in the
city.

The members of the group, Larry
Kean, Richard Pollach and Dick
Kimmel began their music career
in Morgantown. They met there in
graduate school. Two of the
musicians have graduate degress

may be versatile, but they play a

BY BART MACK
Associate Sports Editor

Even though riddled by injuries at
the quarter back spot, the Georgia
Bulldogs still have to rate as the
favorites when they meet Pitt at
Sanford Stadium, in Athens,
Georgia, Saturday afternoon.

Last year Georgia played the
toughest schedule in their history
and compiled a 7-4 record. The
Bulldogs were ignored in the bowl

bid department even though two of
their victims (N.C. State and
Georgia Tech) were winners in
post-season affairs.

“We should be an improved
tean,” Georgia coach Vince Dooley

claims. “We have much more
depth in our offensive and
defensive lines than last year.”

On the defense, the Bulldogs have
three interior linemen that will
pose extreme difficulties for the
Pitt offense. Seniors Dan Jones

and Jim Cagle and junior Dan

Spivey all carry high credentials.

“We feel good about our
defensive prospects this year,"
Dooley remarked. “Our main
problem last year was at linebacker
and we must improve our situation
there

At those positions, the Bulldogs
have four sophomores and a pair of
juniors that are scheduled to see
action. Of the three candidates for
the middle spot, two are sophs;

Friday, September 14, 1973-(THE rrrr NEWS—-Page 9

Bulldogs ’ Bark Worse Than Bite?

Thomas Holt is the only junior and
he ran as third string in 1972.
Coper Gunby and Jim Baker are
the second men and both have been
converted from the defensive line
of last year's Georgia frosh.

Clarence Pope and Dan Henson
are sophomores battling junior
Keith Harris for the weakside spot.
Harris was first string varsity last
season while the two sophs enjoyed
good freshmen years.

   Hungry 
 Panthers 

“We’re going down there with the idea of winning, but realistically,
I’d like to know we could come out of there without getting annihilated.
I hope to be respectable.” (Johnny Majors, commenting on
tomorrogs/’s Pitt Georgia football game.)
“I've never gone into a game where we didn’t have a chance to win.
l’ve also never gone into a game where we didn't have a chance of
losing." (Majors at Tuesday's football luncheon.)

“We didn’t come to Pitt to lose. We’ve got to teach our players to
learn not to lose... This team is tired of losing.” (Johnny Majors, upon

» first coming to Pitt.)

On the eve of the first football game that Johnny Majors will coach at
Pitt, it isn’t easy to predict what will happen tomorrow. While talking
about getting rid of the losing attitude here at Pitt, Majors talks about
not getting annihilated. He backs this up however, by declaring, “This
is an unrealistic opener.”

There are many reasons which would justify Pitt’s being blown out of
the field in Athens. The fact that Vince Dooley and his staff have been
at Georgia for ten years, as opposed to Majors‘ ten months, is a good
example. The fact that Georgia has been recruiting for many years the
number of players Pitt did this year also supports a Bulldog romp.

There are other pro Georgia factors as well, like the home field
advantage, and the fact that Georgia will be used to the expected swel-
tering temperatures.

But then there are a few thing the Panthers have going for them.

(Continued on Page 10)

shore up the LCB spot for the
Bulldogs. Both were regulars in
’72. Senior Rich Conn looks to have
the RCB spot nailed down. He led
the Bulldogs in interceptions last
year with five, also starting at
safety when he was needed.

Senior Don Golden has been the
number one strong safety atAthens
for the last two years and at 6-4 and
197 pounds he’ll provide size and
strength to the Bulldog secondary.
James Jackson, another starter for
the last two years, rounds out the
Georgia defense at free safety,
where he was the varsity number
one in ’72. Jackson started at a
cornerback spot when he was
sophomore.

The toughest offensive assign-
ment for coach Dooley is finding a
backup for starting quarterback
Andy Johnson. The second
toughest is keeping Johnson
healthy. Going into the game,
there is no real backup for Johnson
and the number one signal caller
had the wind knocked out of him in
practice this week.

“We have a depth problem at

quarterback,” Dooley admitted.
“All of our backup quarterbacks
were injured in practice this
week.”

Horace King is scheduled for
starting duties at fullback for the
Bulldogs and can also be used as a
tailback. Jimmy Poulis, at tailback,
led the Bulldogs in rushing last
vear.

On the line, seniors Jim Curring-
ton, LT, Mac McWhorter, LG,
Chris Hammond, C, and RG Buck
Baker bring with them an average
of 237 pounds and 6-2 height. Add
soph phenom Rich Appleby at tight
end and senior Bob Bums at
ﬂanker.

Pitt mentor Johnny Majors would
not predict any pattern that the
game might follow, saying,
“There’s no way to predict what
type of game it’ll be. Our players
are anxious but we’ll have to play a
lot of young people;
they're all superstars but by
default, to provide depth. A lot
of young people will be seeing
action.”

Weather forecasts call for no rain
and temperatures in the 90’s for a
Saturday afternoon in Georgia.

Boaters Battle Bucknell  

BY YAIER LEHRER

Coming off a rout of a young

_ Geneva squad by a score of 9-0, the

Pitt booters will bring a little more
confidence and lot more practice
into a game against the Bisons of

Bucknell 1:30 tomorrow at Pitt
Stadium.
The Bucknell team has not

scored a goal against the Panthers
in its two previous meetings, losing
both times by a score of 2-0, and
will be out to erase that black mark
from their record.

“Bucknell is a much improved
team this year,” commented Coach
Bemis, “and they will be showing
us a lot more offense than they
have before.”

The Cats have had about the
same amount of practice as the
Bisons but it still remains to be
seen whether the Panther booters
can work as a cohesive unit with
their limited time of playing
together.

“Our guys know they have a
tough game ahead of them, but
have been working very hard not
making the same sort of mistakes
they made in the Geneva game,”
says Bemis, “But there is no
question that the win against

Geneva has ‘given them more
confidence and has helped to
prepare them mentally for this
game.”

It will be last week’s lineup that
will face the Bisons with only the
wing positions in question, being a
toss-up between some four players,
while the Bison lineup is pretty
much set with only last year’s

goalie gone from the Bucknell
roster.

This is Bucknell’s first official
game of the season and their
rustiness could show but this is still
a team that has played together
before and should give the
Panthers some very stiff competi-
tion, and in a way this is also Pitt’s
first real soccer game of the
season.

Hungry
Panthers

(Continued from Page-9)

Johnny‘ Majors has assembled the finest young coaching stafflinthe
country, and many of its members are familiar with Southeastern
conference football. This will be a “homecoming for Majors, and I
really don’t think he is going to be embarrased in front of his family
and friends.

This is the first game for a new, enthusiastic staff, and in Tony
Dorsett and Carson Long, among others, the Bulldogs may see a potent
scoring machine.

The word outvof Athens is that Georgia is taking the game lightly,
looking ahead to its big showdown with Alabama next month,‘and not
being overly concerned with its first three opponents.

Perhaps most important though, is the fact that Pitt Panthers are
hungry. Every returnee from last year's squad is sick and tired of
being beaten every Saturday. Monday practices are mentally hard to
take when you lose, and Jackie Sherrill and the rest of the assistants
aren't going to be too pleased either.

Pit came close to winning many games last year, and with the addition
of the likes of Long, Dorsett. Kelcy Daviston, Gary Burley, and more, I
feel that the Panthers have the needed edge that they lacked last
season.

I’m not going to predict that Pitt will upset Georgia tomorrow. But

the game will not be a runaway, and the Panthers will not be
embarrassed or annihalated. Georgia did not score more than 28

’ points in one game all of last season, and they will"not ‘do sé’ against

Pitt. Furthermore, Pitt is going to score at least two touchdowns.
' The strength of the 1973 Panther lies in the defense. Even last
season, without the extra beef Maiors recruited, the defense played
well, considering the fact that it spent most of each game on the
playing field. In the words of Sherrill, “We will chase the football,”
and there may be a few loose ones to chase.
The Bulldogs could be in for a surprise when they see the Pitt offense.
Dorsett seems to be the type of player that the defense must key on,

— and if Georgia does that, the rest of the offense should make good

headway. If not, well, Doresett could score two touchdowns himself.

Yes, Pitt has a chance of defeating the biggest Southern team that
Majors has ever seen. It will be an upset though, but it could happen,
because the Panthers are hungry.

As long as I'm making predictions, I may as well take a shot at the
rest of the season. If Pitt beats Georgia, I can't see Majors losing more
than three games the rest of the season. If Georgia does come out
ahead, Istill think Pitt could win seven games, and deﬁnitely will have
a winning season.

Frosh Fill Depth Chart

BY VINCE DI NARDO

When the Pitt Panthers take to
Sanford Staduim Field ‘tomorrow
afternoon at 2:00 P.M. (EST) in
Athens, Georgia, all the talk will
come to an end and, in the musical
words of singer Gilbert O’Sullivan,
it will be time for the John
Majorites to: “Get down, get
down, get down.”

What transgresses in the process
should cue head coach John Majors
on how well the 1973 Cats will be
able to “stand up” under the
certain adversities of the form-
idable 1973 schedule.

The ‘bookies have favored the
Georgia Bulldogsiwith a 17 point
spread on the contest, but Bulldog
head coach Vince Dooley, who will
begin his 10th season at the helm,
is weary of the spread and ignorant
of what to expect from the Majors
coaching staff. From all indica-
tions, however, it ought to literally
be a cat and dog ﬁght in the first
meeting ever by the two teams.

“The game will be a venture into
the unknown for us,” Dooley said
over a phone hookup on Tuesday.
“Not only are the Panthers a new
team, but Majors is a new coach.
That’s double trouble.”

Certainly, the trip will be a
mysterious one for Majors as well.

With two freshmen, two sopho-

mores, and three Junior College
transfers slated to start along with
17 returning lettermen Majors
ﬁnds himself in a foggy mist.

, “There is noway to predict what
kind of game this is going to be,”
Majors said. “We are going to
have a lot of young people in there

and there’s no way of telling what
they are going to do. We’ll be able
to better tell after we evaluate the
game.”

Offensively, the cats will line up
out of the I-Formation with the
backs occasionally splitting.
Majors will employ two wide
receivers and a tight end. On
defense, they will basically line up
in the 5-2--with 5 down lineman, a
nose guard and two linebackers. .

Here is a rundown on how the
Pittsburghers will stack up:

OFFENSIVE LINE: Seniors
Dave Wannstedt (6-5, 230) and
Dave Blandino (6-2, 225) will start
at the tackles. They will be backed
up by a couple of untested
sophomores in Theo Lawrence and
Ed Kucharik.‘ Junior Reynold
Stoner (6-3, 225) and Senior John
Robb (6-4, 225) should get the job
at Guard. Here Pitt seems to have
adequate depth in Senior Ray
Olson and Chis Perry, a Junior.

As of Thursday, Junior Mike
Carey (6-3, 215) had the edge at
center. But, freshman John Pelusi
and Shophomore Ray Zuraw (6-3,
210) are hot on his heels.

Senior Stan Ostrowski (6-2, 202)
has tight end all locked up-- for the
Georgia game at least-- and he will
be backed up by Sophomore James
Farley. Holdover Les Block is
injured. Freshman Clifton Crans-
ford (6-1, 175) is slated to start at
Split End, but Majors could
possibly switch to letterman Bruce
Murphy who was switched to wide
receiver from running back.

OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD: Ma-
jors might be holding his breath on

Quarterbacking position. Junior
Bill Daniels (5-11, 175) will start,
but should he be forced to leave the
game the cats could be in big
trouble. Thursday, Majors was still
not sure as to whom the back up
man would be. Whether it will be
Junior Rich Washinko, Freshman
George O’Korn, or Freshman
Robert Haygood had yet to be
decided.

Freshman Tony Dorsett (5-11,
170) will start at tail back and he
will be relieved by Senior Clair
Wilson. Dave Janesek, (6-1, 202)
seems to have the nod at fullback.
Sophomore Curtis Smith, who was
at Pitt last year but was ineligible
will back Janasek. Todd Toerper
(6-3, 180) hasbeen given the job at
flanker with Rodney Clark--a
transfer from Dade County Junior
College--backing him up.

the panthers are probably strong-

Senior Glenn Hyde (6-3, 240) and
Junior Dave Jancisin (6-5, 230)
manning the tackles and All-
American candidate Jim Buckmon
(6-3, 230) and Sophomore Tom
Perko (6-4, 220) at the ends, the
Cats are solid here. However, an
injury would be deadly.

Behind the stars, Majors has a
line of freshmen: Ed Wilamowski
backs Buckmon, Don Parrish backs
Jancisin, John Hanhauser backs

Hyde. Junior Carlos Hamlin--a
linebacker last year--is behind
Perko.

At nose guard, the Panthers will
have Gary Burley (6-3, 250).

questions.

Following several delays due to
entry problems, the intramural
softball season got under way for
fraternity teams on Wednesday.

On Thursday evening, Kappa
Sigma came from behind to defeat
a good Delta Sigma Phi squad. by a
3-1 tally. As expected, pitching
and defense dominated the game,
as the larger, fourteen-inch ball
made its debut.

Trailing 1-0 in the bottom of the
fourth, Kappa Sigma tied the
game, behind the hustle of
shortstop “Web” Webster. With
two outs, Webster scored all the
way from second, when first base
was left open on a grounder hit to
the second baseman’s right.

Delta Sigma Phi missed a golden
opportunity to recapture the lead in
the fifth. With two on and none
out, Delta Sigma could not advance
a runner until there were two out.
Following an intentional pass,
winning hurler Mike Harp retired
the side on an easy ground ball to
second base.

sixth. With two out and none on,
Steve Brown lined a single to
center, and Bob Jankowski got
aboard on a two-base throwing
error. Mike Heneroty stepped to
the plate and drove home the lead
run with a slow chop to short.
J ankowski scored the insurance run
when the throw to first was
dropped. Hrap completed his
five-hitter by retiring the side in
order in the seventh.

Along with the arrival of the
larger softball comes much contro-
versy. For the most part, the
players do not care for the ball.
Although the ball appears to be
easier to hit, it seems to hang in the
air much longer and bounces much
slower, enabling ﬁelders to reach it
with much greater regularity,
according to talk on the bench.

decided to go to the bigger ball this
term because it is easier to see at
night, and that is probably won't,
repeat, won’tjump out of the park.
The experimental ball will receive a
stern acid test during the following
five weeks. Whether or not it will
turn out a success, only time can
tell. But as of right now, this
miniature canteloupe with strings
is not very popular with the
offensive-minded players.

With the aid of a few thousand pounds of microorga—
nisms, we’re helping to solve the water pollution problem in
Rochester. Maybe the solution can help others.

What we did was to combine two processes in a way
that gives us one of the most efficient water-purifying sys-
tems private industry has ever developed.

One process is called “activated sludge,” developed
by man to accelerate nature’s microorganism adsorption.
What this means is that for the majority of wastes man can
produce, there is an organism waiting somewhere that will
happily assimilate it. And thrive on it.

The breakthrough came when Kodak scientists found
a way to combine the activated sludge process with a trickling
ﬁlter process and optimized the combination.

We tested our system in a pilot plant for ﬁve years.

  and they helped clean up the Genesee River.

(At Kodak, we were working on environmental improvement
long before it made headlines.) And the pilot project worked
so well, we built a ten-million—dollar plant that can purify
36-million gallons of water a day.

Governor Rockefeller called this “the biggest volun-
tary project undertaken by private industry in support of
New York State’s pure-water program.”

Why did we do it? Partly because we’re in business to

make a.proﬁt——and clean water is vital to our business. But in
furthering our own needs, we have helped further society’s.
And our business depends on society. ‘
_ _ We hope our efforts to cope with water pollution will
inspire others to. do ‘the same. And, we’d be happy to share
our water-purifymg information with them. We all need clean
water. «So we all have to work together.

Kodak

More than a business.
