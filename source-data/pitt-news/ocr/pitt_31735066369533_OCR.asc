Second Power Failure in Two Days Hits University

By JEFF COUCH

Pitt News Staff Writer
A second power failure struck
the university Thursday morning

‘ and authorities said it probably was

not related to Wednesday’s mass-
ive electrical failure. .

The power failure occurred at
9:15 a.m. with the -first circuit
restored to working order at 10:16
a.m., and the remainder of the
circuits repaired by 12:30 p.m.,

. according to university officials.

Alex Kaminsky, director of plant
services and building maintenance,
said that one of Pitt’s main
breakers were “kicked out” which
also “kicked out” a Duquesne
Light breaker, causing the power
failure.

According to Kaminsky, the
electrical system was designed so
that the university breaker could
not be “kicked back” into
operating condition until Duquesne
Light returned its breaker to
operation.

Some of the buildings effected by
the Thursday morning power
failure were the Cathedral of
Learning, Schenley Hall and the
Quad, Forbes Quadrangle, Hillman

Library, and the Law building.

When the lights went out and the
air conditioners stopped, Pitt
campus police went into action.

Within minutes of Wednesday’s
power failure, campus police
emergency procedures were in
effect and university officials
termed the operation a success.

Ed Bozik, assistant chancellor,
said campus buildings were

evacuated /in about one hour and '

twenty minutes.

“People were calm and I thought
they reacted quite yvell to it,” he
said. '

Jim Watters, from the campus
police office of planning and
research, called the emergency

Watters said police officers were
dispatched immediately to every
building on campus as soon as the
blackout occurred, physically
checked each building and reported
any problems to proper authorities.

Officers also spent time rescuing
people stranded in elevators,
according to Watters. '

Police were informed of the
stranded people by emergency
telephones within the elevators and
a device that automatically notiﬁed
them of any problem, Watters said.

AsslstantDirector’s Resignation: More to Come?

Conney Kimbo insists there will not be any major‘
staff changes in the Office of Student Activities this
summer.

Pitt’s vice chancellor for student affairs said last
week that when the new director of student activities
takes office Aug. 1, it is doubtful he (the director)
will replace the cureent six advisors on the first floor
of Schenley Hall.

“I would not expect the director to come in and
clean house unless people were not producing,”
Kimbo said last week. “If you have good people, it is
foolish to release them.” , _

Yesterday, however, Nancy Evans, assistant
director of student activities, resigned to take a
position in the Graduate School of Business’s office
of the dean. Evans’ duties included advising the
Student Government Board’s Allocations Commit-
tee. Her departure could be a sign of things to come.

Still, Kimbo said yesterday that it is “false to
presume” the new director will be followed by staff
changes.

“As far as I’m concerned, the only position that
has to be filled is Nancy Evans’,” Kimbo said.

It is a fact, however, that more than one member v

of the current office have sent resumes elsewhere.

Nice Try

  Letter

Good guys finish last, so the old cl-iche goes, but
the truth behind the saying will be brought to light
should the house of representatives pass a bill that

will give President Carter the power to order gasoline

‘rationing if there is a severe energy crisis.

One of the clauses in Carter’s plan, already ap-
proved by the Senate, is that gasoline allocations will
be based on each state’s prior consumption. There-
fore, passage of the bill as it stands will mean larger
fuel allotments for states who are conspicuous con-
sumers and small allotments for small users-—like
Pennsylvania.

What Carter’s plan_ ignores, according to Pen-
nsylvania Governor Richard T hornburgh, is the fact
that some states have been consciously cutting back
in energy usage since the energy crunch of 1974.

“The program carried out in this state was
designed to limit consumption,” said Thornburgh,
who was in Pittsburgh yesterday to discuss the issue.
“It (the bill) simply doesn’t make sense to me.
We’re being penalized for being the good guys.”

Granted, Carter’s plan has taken many area’s, of

rationing into consideration. Carter agreed not to-

use the powers except in dire emergencies and to
make more gasoline available for farmers, taxi cabs
and truck drivers and for certain energy-related in-
dustries. In addition, there would be a three car limit
in obtaining coupons. The limit is intended to keep
people from buying junk cars to become eligible for
additional gasoline rations. ,

Although we believe that rationing is not the an-
swer to the energy situation, it is almost a certainty
that the bill will be passed.

. Jeanne Bingman, Production Editor

Thornburgh said he has sent letters to the White
House and Secretary of The'Department of Energy,
James Schesslinger protesting the basis for
allocations. All well and good, but in this case the
pen is not mightier than the sword. The gravity of
the energy crisis and the seriousness of gasoline
rationing-—which has not been in effect since World
War II—calls for more definite action.

Thornburgh’s 11th hour efforts may help him
maintain his credibility among his constituency but it
was a superficial gesture that boils down to saving
face and nothing more.

It appears that no lessons were learned from the
gasoline shortages of five years ago. If rationing is

the price we must pay for forgotten ‘lessons, then -

politicians should learn to do their homework.

The front page article of the May
3, 1979 issue of The Pitt News
(Scaife Rape Suspect Arraigned on
Tuesday) was an example of poor
investigative reporting by the

staff writer. If the reporter had

done her “homework” and had
interviewed staff, students, and
faculty at Scaife Hall, the
erroneous assumptions verbalized
by Police Chief Graham would have
been dispelled and‘- there would be
no need for this letter.

Police Chief Graham is wrong!
The “interest and fear” sup-
posedly enacted after a rape
incident has not “died down”, and
more than “a few people” have

i been ‘attending meetings at Scaife

Hall. .

The first meeting was held with
Security (at which Police Chief
Graham was present) numbering

_, 30 in attendance. At this meeting a

contact network was established. It
was through this network that the
Crime Prevention Unit was able to
make contacts and obtain inform-
ation instrumental to their survey.

The second meeting held with
Security more than doubled in
attendance, including depart-
mental administrators.
incidents were reported during that
meeting to Security representatives
Conte, Watters and Westbrooks
which illustrate that the decline in
interest has been on the part of
Security and not the staff, faculty
and students. Officer Conte
assured those in attendance that at
10:00 p.m. Security personnel were
stationed at the fourth floor
entrance to check I.D.’s and ensure
that the register is signed.
However, it was brought out at that
meeting that since the rape
incident, various staff, faculty and

Several a

graduate students had not been
stopped, nor asked for identi-
fication. One faculty member was
told not to sign the register because
the sheet was full.

The last meeting held (a
presentation on rape prevention at
which Security representation was
present) numbered 155 including
staff, faculty and students. Since
that last meeting numerous
requests have been made to
reschedule more meetings. The
number of concerned staff, stu-
dents and faculty at Scaife Hall is
not dwindling. It is steadily
increasing. ‘

Another false assumption
presented in The Pitt News was
the caption under the photograph
“Business is Back to Usual at

Scaife Hall”. Business is not back

to usual. The atmoshpere is mixed
with apprehension, fear and anger.

Not one interim measure has been
implemented even though Police
Chief Graham publically admitted’
at our first meeting that there was a
“total lack of security at Scaife”.

The staff, students and faculty are
awaiting the results of the survey
that has been submitted to the Vice
Chancellor of Business and Finance
and the Vice Chancellor of the
Health Related Professions. If
stricter security measures are not
implemented at Scaife, there will
not only be an atmosphere of
apprehension, fear and anger, but
total disillusionment which will
undoubtedly trigger further actions
by the occupants of Scaife Hall.

This letter has been signed by
staff, faculty and students of Scaife
who are in agreement that the
article in The Pitt News and
speciﬁcally Police Chief Graham’s
remarks do not accurately portray
our commitment. It is expected in
the future that The Pitt News and
speciﬁcally Police Chief Graham’s
remarks do not accurately portray
our commitment. It is expected in

the future that The Pitt News

and inclusive articles surrounding
incidents at Scaife Hall and that
Police Chief Graham will carefully
analyze the situation before making
general assumptions. We can

strongly about securing Scaife Hall
and will continue to pursue this

Jilana And The Exotic  World Of Oriental Dance

By MARK HOLAN

Oriental dancing, known as “belly
dancing” in the venacular, was first
introduced to the United States in 1893.
The cite was the Chicago World’s Fair
and the main attraction of three dancers
was a short, chubby girl named Little
Egypt.

Little Egypt appeared clad in long robes
that covered all but her stomach-—hence
“belly” dancing. It wasn’t long after this
that an anonymous vaudeville promoter
(known to oriental dancers as Mr. Sonny
0. Boy or Mr. S.O.B.) turned this
imported dance genre into a sexist side
show. To those ignorant of its origins,
oriental dancing has since come to be
thought of as something on a par with
strip-tease and go-go dancing.

It isn’t. And Ruth Kirsch. who performs
and teaches oriental dance under .the
name Jilana, is quick to point out this
popular misconception.

“Originally, oriental dancing was used
as an exercise for the preparation of

natural childbirth,” said Kirsch. Many of
today’s exercises for naturalchildbirth, in
fact, are based on oriental dance
techniques andmovements which date
back to 5000 B.C.

Dance was used not only as a
preparation for childbirth, but also as a
guide todelivery. A gathering of friends
would dance around the. conceiving
woman, providing a sense of rhythm as
she went into contractions. A spirit‘ of.
solidarity among the women was also
provided. V

This intimate connection between

’ childbirth and oriental dance  perhaps

be thought of in sexual terms.. I '

(Interestingly, oriental dance was even-
tually practiced by men becausefof a
belief that the messiah couldlonly be

became one of the ‘few privileg'es_— that _ _

women were permitted in the way of
entertainment. The dance of the seven
veils is not a strip tease (although
clothing is removed) but rather a
symbolic dance of women freeing
themselves from male domination and
life’s problems.

Kirsch became interested in oriental
dance through a course she took while
attending Clark University in Wisconsin.
She soon found it to be_the most enjoyable
genre she has studied and learned to

Among these are cymbals, Swords, and
candles. T

Besides performing, Kirsch also teaches

‘dance at the -Community College. This,’

coupled with a combination of daily West

African and Jazz Dance exercises, help

keep her in shape.

“Oriental dance is sensual‘ but not
sexual.” emphasized Kirsch, alluding
again to the perversion of what she feels
is a beautiful art form.-

' Park College

Pittsburgh Playhouse

Poet-composer Rod McKuen was on
hand last Thursday for the world
premiere of his first musical compositions
for ballet. On opening night, he spoke to
the audience briefly during the second
intermission. McKuen talked about what
he sees as the breaking down of barriers
between different art forms. He views
this as a healthy trend since such
distinctions are not important and
because this intermingling results in
greater popularity for all forms.»

The program illustrated his point
emphatically. The variety of styles
ranged from classical ballet to jazz-disco
to hoedown.

The main feature was McKuen’s
“Americana Suite” as choreographed by
American Dance Ensemble founder
Nicolas Petrov. (McKuen conﬁded he
prefers to call the piece “R.F.D.”)
The scene is a turn of the century
American village in late afternoon.
Among the dancers are cowboys and
cowgirls, acrobats, a rainmaker, and a
drunk who trips and sways with
incredible poise. The piece, with its
carnival atmosphere, is a sentimental
look at romantic notions of our American
roots. The dancing is lively, at times even
rowdy.

The premiere included two other

 “Short and Suite,” choreographed by

A number of presentations preceded

the selections by McKuen. Among them A

was another world premiere, “Oh Happy
Day.” This jazz piece also choreographed
by Bentz was the most engaging part of
the entire performance. ‘

The first scene, in a chapel, portrays
the emotion of gospel service. As Aretha
Franklin sings “Amazing Grace,” the
dancing begins in a slow ﬂow, then rises
to a feverish pitch. During the next scene,

The third scene is. the best. . ‘The

He is joined ﬁrst by a man ‘(Marty
McDonough), then by a woman (Denise
Azzari) and the three weave together in a
twining, sensuous dance.

Mark Hall Amitin’s Vision

of a Changing Theater

By MICHAEL McCABE

The Floating Theatre brought Mark Hall

(Amitin to Pitt this week to hold his

“Visions for a Changing Teatre”
workshop.

Amitin, who recieved his doctorate
degree from the University of Paris, now
lives in New York City but says he spends
about half of his time on the road. In
addition to conducting workshops, he is

- currently working on a project with noted ‘

playwright Edward Albee and also
developing a series for the Public
Broadcasting System of experimental
theatre.

“It involves a lot of improvisation, but
there are basic structures that we work
from. We begin with simple exercises,”
said Amitin in describing his workshop.
As an example, he explained an exercise
called fast/ slow where half of the
participants walk as fast as they can along

a diagonal line across the ﬂoor while the A

other half walk as slow as they can along
another diagonal that crosses the fast
moving line. The command “freeze” may
be given at any time. This exercise
improves balance. v
Another dimension can be added, once

  suowusr on

,

Movies

the walkers are frozen, by having them
start a spontaneous conversation with the
person nearest them on some random
subject such as “carrots.”

The eventual goal is to develop an
experimental piece (A brief sketch or skit)
out of a series of exercises. Amitin said
that the idea is to “structure the piece by
using the voice and the body in a way that
differs from standard theatrical tech-
niques.”,He added that, since it has no
text, the piece involves “Not so much
people playing characters as they are
being performers.”

Possibly due to the time of year and the

, beautiful weather outside, few people

showed up for the workshop, scheduled to
run Monday through Friday in the Studio
Theatre. Amitin was disappointed but to
not too concerned over the turnout. “I
don’t think it’s me,” he remarked. “I go
to other schools and usually get a good
response.”

Don Merinelli, administrative assistant
for the Floating Theatre, noted that
Amitin’s “Visions for. a Changing
Theatre” has been rescheduled as part of
the new season this fall and will return for
two and a half ' days, November 30
through December 2. — .

  A Visit To Woody Allen’s Beautiful Manhattan

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Manhattan
Directed by Woody Allen

“Manhattan” is the quintessential
Woody Allen ﬁlm. Dealing with Allen’s
two favorite themes—confused relation-
ships and a love of New York, the picture
is in many ways similiar to Allen’s award
winning “Annie Hall” and, in a few
ways, superior.

Plotwise, “Manhattan”centers around
Isaac Davis (Allen), a successful
television writer. Twice divorced at 42,
he is having an affair with a sophisticated
high school senior (Marial Hemingway).
His lesbian exwife (Meryl Streep) who
divorced him for another woman is
writing a book about their relationship,
and he learns that his best friend Yale
(Michael Murphy), who Isaac thinks has
the only perfect marriage around, is
cheating on his wife (Anne Byrne) with
Mary, an obnoxious journalist (Diane
Keaton).

Mary and Isaac begin a relationship
that is almost as complicated as the
Allen-Keaton romance in “Annie Hall.”
The focus of the film is on people, not
plot, and the interactions of the cast are
witty, funny and invariably touching.

Keaton, looking improbably like Jill

Clayburgh wearing a pressed “Annie
Hall”,wardrobe, is a neurotic egocentric
in her early scenes. Later, when she
shows her vulnerability, the performance
is one of Keaton’s best.

Murphy, playing the part that Tony
Roberts usually does onlyibetter, is ﬁne.
as is Byrne in her screen debut.

Hemingway, though, throws the film
off kilter. Presumably, she is in the film
to represent innocence among the jaded
Manhattan sophosticates, but she is as
cool and remote as a Saks mannequin.
Even in scenes at the soda fountain
counter where she gives Isaac a
harmonica lack the sweetness and
sentimentality the part calls for.
Hemingway, with cheekbones so pro-
minent they could support two of the
cantilevered stories from Falling Water.
seems incapable of emotion and this
severly damages the structure of
“Manhattan.”

Allen is Allen—what more can one ask?
Isaac looks for love in a world where the
name of the game is confusion; when he
at last finds it, he is unable to accept it.

The dialogue is vintage Allen. One-
liners and wisecracks ﬂy across at an
almost alarming pace. “Mating for life
only happens between pigeons and
Catholics,” Isaac tells Yale morosely.
There are the sly digs at vapid
sophistication and there are genuinely

ludicrous situations like Isaac’s wife
accusing him of trying to run down her
lover with his car. “I wasn't driving
fast,” he protests. “You took the whole
front porch off the cabin when you
crashed,” she retorts. T
Filmed in black and white, the shots of

the city in “Manhattan” are stunning-
particularly the scenes in the planetarium
where Isaac and Mary wander through
exhibits of the galaxy.

The score—all classic George Gersh-
win——is excellent, adding just the right
atmosphere of intimacy.

“The Innocent” Powerful Last
Work by Director Visconti

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

“The Innocent” is a highly touted film
by. Luchino Visconti mainly because he
died soon after its completion.

But it’s more than that. Visconti has
painted a vivid and all-too-clear picture of
what Victorian life must have been like.

“The Innocent" plays on the good old
Victorian double standard‘. It’s okay for
Tullio Hermil (Giancarlo Gianini) to play
around as much as he wants, but if his
wife Guiliana (Laura Antonini) tries the
same thing, then all hell breaks loose and
she is made to feel subservient.

This plot unwinds slowly. First we
learn of Hermil’s relationship/ affair with
Teresa Raffe (Jennifer O’Neill), and his
subsequent desire to leave his wife for
her (“You’re just like a sister now,” he
claims to Guiliana).

Things develop into a real mess for all
concerned when Hermil discovers his
wife’s love affair with an author, Filippe
D’Arborio (Marc Porel). After this, in the
best Victorian double-standard tradition,
Hermil tries to get back with Guiliana and
convince her that he loves her, with all
sorts of empty talk.

He soon learns of her pregnancy to

D’Arborio and tries to (force her to have

an abortion, which she refuses to do.

D’Arborio'dies of a disease contracted
while in _Africa, and the child is born
fatherless..

The scary part of this film is that stuft
like this probably did happen. There
probably were people like this, men like
Hermil who, thanks to Victorian culture,
were able to get away with virtually

New Barbarians: Some Stones and a Few Friends

By CRIS HOEL

New Barbarians‘
Civic Arena
May 2, 1979

Though rough edges robbed the New
Barbarians of some deserved luster, the
band recently constructed by Ron Wood
and led by Keith Richards offered a
splendid show from a ghoulish Civic

I Arena stage last Wednesday.

The Barbarians’ are a Rolling Stones-
' rooted band whose main purpose during a
hastily charted 17-city tour appears to be
the promotion‘ of Wood’s current album
(“Gimme Some Neck”). But while
plaqued by the Stones’ ghost and a
horrendous effort at the sound mixer. the
Barbarians compensated for a lack of
polish with ﬂashes of talent that often
thrilled a crowd of some 12,000 persons
during a show that consumed more than
two hours.

The evening's constant highlight was
bright guitar work by Richards and
Wood. but even their exceptional display
was dissipated needlessly in several
ways. 0

A pair of equally inexcusable errors
teamed to thwart what could have been
an exceptional performance. This was a
quickly conceived show—Wood’s name
was mispelled on every ticket—but that
does not explain the use of radio spots
whose content (a string of Rolling Stones
riffs) led the audience to believe this

would be a Mick Jagger-less Stones
concert. And whomever was at the
controls of the mixing board did his best
to waste an excellent combination of
artistic and technical resources through-
out the evening.

But the oft-repeated sight—and
sound—of Richards and— Wood jamming
face-to-face was enough to make the
crowd excuse poor sound and forget
Jagger.

There was variety of music—carefully
constructed Wood-based tunes mixed
with blues and let-it-rip rock ‘n’ ro1l—and
a consistency of performance that was
more than enough to remind anyone that
Keith Richards and his usual band are
unsurpassed even today anﬂ that
Richards can entertain even with
unfamiliar material.

Many songs from “Gimme Some
Neck” were well-tailored to the abilities
of Richards, Wood and a back-up band
that featured bassist Stanley Clarke,

drummer Joseph Modelistex, sometimes-I

Stones Ian MacLagen (keyboards),and
Bobby Keyes (saxophone).

“Worry No '

More," “Don’t Worry,” “Lost and
Lonely” and “Seven Days” formed this
portion of the show.

The three Stones songs the Barbarians
chose were wisely selected. “Honky
Tonk Woman,” whose recognizable intro
did more for the crowd than did two hours
of Wood’s prancing, allowed the audience
to breathe a mid-show sigh of relief and
halted the “Will they play any Stones?”
wondering. .

“Before They Make Me Run,”
probably the best song found on the
Stones’ latest album and the only “Some
Girls” cut on which Richards supplies
lead vocals, also was a peak and an
extended version of “Jumpin’ Jack
Flash” was a perfect encore.

The band was familiar with the Rolling
Stones songs. Richards, at least as much
as Jagger, supplies the thrust that long
has placed the Stones atop the rock ’n’
roll heap. Wood replaced Mick Taylor at
guitar and other instruments for the
Stones some time ago and his
contributions to “Some Girls” are
substantial. .

Keyes toured with the Stones during
their American tour of early 1972 and
MacLagen also was a party to “Some
Girls.” Clarke may be jazz’s finest bassist
and Modeliste, if nothing else, was loud,
thanks to mixer manipulator.

The Stones, growing old, are in the
midst of a search for new direction (many
fear that direction will be downhill) and
have not been in Pittsburgh since the
early ’70s. Their most recent tour of this
country, and their most recent album,
were not warmly received by critics and
followers. The lackluster atmosphere
said to surround the current Stones
however was not to be found at the
Arena.

The stage—a sheet of white with red
paint spashed about—-was covered with

clothing throughout the evening, since,

dazzling guitar work occasionally caused
fans to shed jackets and toss them at
Richards and Wood. It takes a rare
product of ‘vability, effort and enthusiasm
to take the shirt from a fan’s back; those
ingredients are what fueled the Bar-
barians.

The Innocent:
Victorian Life
And Love

(Continued from page 4)
anything (including murder) in the name
of that culture.

Visconti makes Hermil look like a
villain with his actions. He threatens his
estranged wife with all sorts of
punishment if she doesn't do what he
wants, and gives it to her when she
doesn’t. He’s a real psychopath and
mental case; and the sad part is Guiliana
sees only what he allows her to. Both are
caught up in a web of Victorian society.

In fact, this cruel way of life and
Hermil’s actions make the audience
writhe and ﬁdget in their seats with
disgust. ‘

The audience, however, isn’t distracted
from the believability of the characters.
All persons play their parts very well, and
the three principals play theirs excellent-

- ly. Gianelli throws his psychoses at us,

making his character alive and terrifying.
Antonelli gives off her wide-eyed
innocence with every close-up, and
O'Neill radiates the sultry sexiness that is
Teresa Raffa.

The score is also good. Strings and
piano are used to powerfully set the mood
with various parts of scores by Mozart,
Lizst and Chopin.

Once again a powerful Visconti film,
and one that despite the English subtitles

By MARK HOLAN
Van Halen

May 7, 1979

Billing themselves as the leaders of a

‘new age of rock, Van Halen took the stage '

Monday night before a sold-out crowd at
the Stanley Theatre.

the . Dutch-born’ brothers Van Halen;

‘ ‘A Edward on guitar’ and Alex’ behind the

drums, put out a solid night of rock and
_raw energy. I »

Van A Halen‘ was. unmistakably tight
throughout their two-hour show.

.Although each member had several

moments in the spotlight, especially front
man and .lead singer David Roth, the full
impact of the concert came across as a
group effort. This is certainly a credit to

. the young band on their second major

tour.
The. crowd consisted of primarily

' hard-core fans, a‘ large majority of which
. were under 18, whodanced, clapped and

sang to the well aired songs from the

Cheap Trick
Stanley Theatre

It can hardly be argued that Cheap
Trick is one of the hottest rock bands
around these days. Their’ latest album,
“Cheap Trick at Budokan,” a live
recording, is currently one of the top five
albums in the country. The group is
listened to, talked about and written
about more than nearly any other rock act
today. I

Cheap Trick lived up to their reputation

Trick is the leader of the pack.

Rick Nielsen (lead guitar and vocals)
and Robin Zander (lead vocals and guitar)
head the group while Tom Peterson and
Bun E. Carlos back them on bass guitar
and drums, respectively. Zander sings on
center stage while the antics and artistry

‘of Nielsen captivate the crowd. Not your
typical rock ﬁgure, Nielsen looks like a
middle-aged man dressed as a 10-year-
old English schoolboy.

His zaniness aside, Nielsen is a highly
respected guitarist. His personal guitar

Roth _is undoubtly a candidate for

He is a volatile combination of Robert

and Mick Jagger’s moves (though more
energized) wrapped-up in that front man
cockiness of all three. ‘Roth’s energy

show .with many
individual soloes, he dominated never-
theless. His longest solo, “Eruption,”
the intro to “You Really Got Me,” a
Kinks tune from the first Van Halen
album, was one of the evening’s
highlights however. .

Brother Alex and bassist Mike Anthony
provided a strong base line to Van

Halen’s hard rock sound. Anthony's solo I
. in smoke of dry ice and Alex’s lit drum

stick finale to “Atomic Punk” added to
the overall cosmetics of the show and
pleased the crowd but were not especially
good musically.

Van Halen did all but one song from
their first album, highlights “Running
With the Devil,” “Ain’t Talking About

Love,” and “Jamie’s Crying.”

Linda Ronstandt’s “You’re No Good,”

“Sombody Get Me A Doctor” and

“Dance The Night Away” from the
second album were also met with

thunderous applause.

Warming-up for Van Halen was

‘Pittsburgh's own Stemrock Fever. The

five member band was well received.
They did four original songs and closed
with Deep Purple’s “Highway Star” and
Ted Nugent’s “Good Friends And A
Bottle Of Wine.” The formerwas the
better of the two imitations.

Pittsburgh will no doubt see Van Halen
headline another show soon. “Ain’t
Talking About Love” was recorded for an
upcoming live album. If Van Halen,
continues to put out as many hit songs as
they have on their first two albums and '
can maintain their high energy level, they
may well be the leaders of a new age of
rock that they claim to be. ‘

Energetic Rick James
Better Than Adverage

By DAVID E. STUBBS

Rick James
Stanley Theatre
May 5, 1979

When Rick James and the Stone City
Band came to Pittsburgh on Saturday
night for two shows, little more was
expected than an average funk show.
Surprisingly, this show was a welcomed
relief.

Rick James, performance was a very
energetic trip into ’ his famed “Punk
Funk.” “Punk Funk” is James’ own
brand of funk complete with sexual -'
antics, marijuana, fantasies and of course
the ability to make you want to groove. '

The best thing about the show was the

fact that J ames? played the majority of his _ ' ‘
songs. A lot of acts will disappoint ‘alarge ;

number of their fans by not doing this.

The major highlights of the evening _— A

were the performances of “Hollywood,”

“Sexy Lady,’_’ “High On Your Love
Suite,” and thepopular Pittsburgh hits,
“You and I” and _“Mary Jane.” '

’ Rick James played spot performances.
on a variety j of I instruments. including
guitar, bass, clavinet, and conga. His
performance showed that there is much
ta1ent‘within~.thje .‘p‘ego-mad” funk star.

models and he made use of at least 10 of
them Sunday night.

Playing on his pedastal, tossing guitars
to the roadies, ﬂicking guitar picks to the
audience and strapping on three and four
guitars at a time are all activities of
Nielsen throughout the course of the
show. ‘ .

The band stuck to the format of their
recent “Budokan” album for most of the
night, playing nine of the 10 tunes
from that L.P. Other songs were taken
from the most recent studio album.
“Heaven Tonight.” One of the

highlights of the show was ‘ ‘I Know What
I Want, and I Know How to Get It” from
their forthcoming album “Dream

Police.” Another treat was the rocking-

rendition of the Beatles “Day Tripper’ ’ as
the first encore number. And of course
the smash hit “Surrender,” “I Want You
to Want Me” and “Ain’t That a Shame”
were the real show-stoppers.

The Seattle-based band TKO opened
the show for Cheap, Trick. Starting like
gangbusters with the outstanding “Rock
and Roll Again,” they continued to win
over the crowd with eight songs from

their debut album “Let It Roll.”
Thegroup sounds extremely like The
Who, especially in the studio. Lead
singer Brad Sinsel looks and sounds like
‘Roger Daltry. Guitarist Rick Pierce has
quick feet and fast guitar playing ﬁngers.
Tony Bortko, Darryl Siguenza and Mark
Seidenverg round out the hard-rocking
quintet. '
Pittsburgh was exposed to the future of
rock and roll Sunday night. As the 1980's
roll around, look for Cheap Trick‘ and
TKO to still be rocking and rolling at the
top.

The Bettervision Eye Clinic is
now offering a program of eye-
exercises that can safety correct
most cases of poor eyesight-so
that glasses -or contact lenses
are no longer needed. Originally
developed by Dr. William H. Bates
of the New York Eye Hospital, this
method has been widely used by the
Armed Forces, schools, clinics, and
thousands of private individuals, for
the treatment of:

O nearsightedness
O farsightedness
O astigmatism

O middle-age sight

For many years it was thou ht that .

poor eyesight was just bad uck, or
something you inherit from your parents.
Scientists now know that most eyesight
problems are caused by accumulated
stress and tension——which squeeze the
eyeball out of shape, and affect. the
muscles that do the focusing. The result
is the eye cannot form a clear image, and
the world appears to be blurry. In peo le
over 40, the natural aging process is a so
an important factor.

No matter what
your eyesight problem
the Bates Method can help you. .
This is a health care program,
and will benefit
everyone who follows ‘it-—
children, adults, and seniors.

It is important to understand that
glasses do not cure a visual problem.
hey are simply a compensating device
—-—like crutches. In fact, glasses usually
make the condition worse. Because they
make the eyes weak and lazy, a minor
problem often develops into a lifetime of
wearing glasses.

The Bates Method corrects poor
eyesight by strengthening the eye-
musc es and relaxing the eyeball. You do
simple easy exercises that increase your
focusing power, eliminate eyestrain, and
bring your eyesight back to normal.

Because the Bates Method deals with
the basic cause of your eyesight
problem, you canexpect to see a definite
improvement in as little as 1 or 2 weeks.
Even if you have worn glasses all your
life—-things will become clearer and
clearer, and you will have flashes of good
vision. . . as you go through the program,
these ﬂashes become lon er and more
frequent. . .gradually b endin into
permanent better sight——at whic point
the exercises are no longer necessary.

We usually find that people whose
eyesight is not too bad can return to
20/20 vision in about a month. Even if
your eyesight is really oor, within 2
to 3 months you should e able to put
away your glasses, once and for all. Read
these case histories:

 

Aldous Huxley—Nobel Author

“My vision was getting steadily worse,
even with greatly strengthened glasses.
To my dismay I realized I was going
blind. On the advice of my Doctor I
decided to try the Bates Method. There
was an immediate irn rovement. After
only 2 months I was a le to read clearly
without glasses. Better still, the cataract
which had covered part of one eye for
over 16 years was beginning to clear up.”

Rev. Frederick A. Milos, M.S.

“By following the simple exercises ‘ven
in this rogram, I have compfeltely
recovere my vision. Now I can read for
long periods without my glasses.”

Ron Moore—Technician

“I originally went to the Clinic to deliver
some equipment—and ended up trying
their e e-exercise program. I am near-
sighte , and have worn glasses for 15
yrs. In just 3 weeks after starting
the program, my‘ eyesight has already
improved to the point where I can now
drive, do business, and watch T.V.—all
without my glasses!”

Third-Baseman Mihalik Knuckles Down Despite Injury 1

By KAREN KADILAK ~
pm News sum Writer

A freak accident may have put a
damper on a good baseball season
for Panther Chris Mihalik, but it
did not prevent the third baseman
from playing in either of Pitt’s
weekend double-headers.

Despite a severely cut knuckle he
suffered when changing the oil in a
friend’s car last Thursday, Mihalik
started in three of the four games
Pitt (13-4) played against Charion
and Penn State last weekend.

“Saturday, the ﬁnger hurt like
hell, but it didn’t bother me
Sunday,” explained Mihalik, play-

ing with ﬁve stitches on his right

ring ﬁnger. “Saturday, I was
batting with two ﬁngers. It hurt
that much.”

“Chris did a good job‘ ﬁelding
the ball, although he did have some
trouble holding the bat against
Clarion,” Pitt coach Bob Lewis
said. “We didn’t start him in the
second game against Clarion
because of that problem.”

According to Lewis, Mihalik
played better Sunday.

“He had a really good day in the
ﬁeld against Penn State, turning
over two double plays,” the
Panther coach said. “Chris also

After suffering the injury, the
sophomore from Allentown did not
know whether he would play again
this season. “The doctor in the
emergency room told me I would
miss a week or two, which meant I_
would have been out for the rest of
the season,” Mihalik said Thurs-
day. “But I saw Kip Smith, the Pitt
trainer, and he told me I probably
could play Saturday.”

“The trainer taped Mihalik’s

Lewis said. “Chris did not want to

Agostinella. _

Agostinella foresees this years
invitational to be ﬁlled with much
more quality in the Panthers’
corner. The meet‘ will bring in
some tough competition for Pan-
thers, but Agostinella believes Pitt
will fare well.

“This invitational will be one of
the better meets in the East this
season,” said Agostinella. “It will
ﬁeld a total of 10 all-Americans. I,
think our events will do much

better this year than we did last’
lseasonl.”

Top names who will compete in
tonight’s and Saturday’s events
include Garnett Edwards of WVU

NCAA high-hurdle competition.
Coming out of rival Penn State are
two long distance all-Americans,
Bob Snyder and.Alan Scharsu, in
the 2-mile and 3-mile respectively.
Mark Hunter, a three-time all-
American distance runner from
Cleveland State will be another to
keep an eye on.

The Panthers will have their
share of top-place contesters in the
opening trials tonight.‘ Among
those who are favored to ﬁnish
highly will be Pitts 400- and 1600-
meter relay teams. The 400 team

Pitt News Staff Writer _

At the opening of the 1979 track
season, Coach Mike Agostinella
was well aware of the fact he had
been blessed with a fine crop of
freshmen athletes. Midway
through the indoor season, one of
those first-year Panthers, Larry
Kinney, started to make his
competition take notice.

After only three meets with the
Panthers, Kinney broke Pitt’s
if’ door triple jump record when he
recorded a 50-6 jump at the Pitt

, Relays. One week later, Kinney
broke this record while participa-
ting inthe Princeton Relays.

beginning of indoor season,” said
Kinney. “In each of those first
three meets I kept improving.
After those, though, there was less
competition.”

Kinney says he enjoys outdoor
competition better than indoor as
long as the weather is suitable.
“As long as the weather is warm
I'd rather jump outdoors because
indoor tends to make you feel
closed in. It also makes you feel as
if you are jumping a farther
distance, which you aren’t.”

High school dictated Kinney’s

jump in which Kinney performed
his best in his last two years of high
school competition.
year he was second in the PIAA
meet. He bettered this by taking
first place in the same event one
year later. Combining his track
talents with service on the
basketball team, he was named as
a high school scholar athlete and as
the school’s Outstanding Athlete as
a senior.

Kinneys’ goal this season is to
qualify for nationals, which will be
held in three weeks. In order to do
so he must jump 52 feet, a distance

took first place at the prestigious
Penn Relays.

“The Penn Relays were a trip,”
said Kinney. “I was really
surprised because I had thought a
lot of people would do a lot better.
I was really pleased with the
outcome of the relays, although I
think better weather conditions
could have produced better re-
sults.” '

Kinney now has three ‘more
chances to qualify for the NCAA
championships: the Pitt Invita-

‘ ‘My goal this year was to qualify
for the nationals,” said Kinney.
“It’s nice when you can win but it
wouldn’t be a big setback to lose. I

wasn’t able to qualify for the indoor‘

nationals so I would really like
qualifying for the outdoor.”

Looking to the Invitational this
weekend, Kinney sees much of his
competition coming from the
Virginia Military Institute. “They
have a few jumpers in the 50 and 51
range,” said Kinney, “but I don’t
think there is anyone who will be
