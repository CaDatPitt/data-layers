Philip Wion: the planning process is ‘fundamentally flawed]

Mondale wins New York,
brings his campaign here

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News J

Walter Mondale last night re-established
himself as the leading candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination going
into next week’s Pennsylvania primary by
scoring a lopsided victory in the New York
race for 252 conventi.on delegates.

In what stands as his most significant vic-
tory to date, Mondale swept past Senator
Gary Hart, capturing 47 percent of the vote.
With 85 percent of the returns in, Mondale
had -secured 525,844 votes compared to
Hart’s 324,880 or 29 percent.

Jesse Jackson ran a close third with 22
percent of the vote, much of which ‘came
from New York City where he ran second to
Mondale.

With the New York race behind them, the
three candidates will turn their attention to
Pennsylvania, home of an April 10 primary
in which ll7 delegates will be at stake.

Pittsburgh will host the third in a series of
debates sponsored by the League of Women
Voters tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the David L.
Lawrence Convention Center.

Both Hart and Jackson have made tena- _

tive plans to campaign on the Pitt campus
tomorrow afternoon. Hart’s campus organ-

izers have secured time in the David Law— .

rence Auditorium for a possible visit by the

candidate, and one of his more notable sup-
porters, singer/songwriter Carole King, will
perform tomorrow from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. in
the William” Pitt Union.

Jackson is scheduled to appear at noon
tomorrow in the Moot Teplitz Memorial
Courtroom on th-e lower level of the Law
School Building. Jackson’s appearance is
being sponsored by the Black American Law
Student Association. ' .

Mondale will arrive in Pittsburgh tomor-
row morning and will make an appearance
at Sacred Heart'High School in Shadyside
sometime later in the day.

The debate, to be attended by over 500
media members and an equal number of
invited dignitaries and guests, yesterday sur-
vived an attempted legal block by the Lyn-
don L_aRouche Campaign. LaRouche’s
third-party campaign, based largely on the
right wing activists anti-Kissinger message,
claimed discrimination on the part of the
league which turned down his request to be
included in the debate lineup.

Judge Silvestri Silvestri refused to hear
the case on the grounds that, as a private
organization, the League of Women Voters
could determine the debate participants.

According to Marjorie Hecht, a campaign
coordinator at LaRouche’s New York head-
quarters, the ruling will be appealed to the
Federal Elections Committee on the
grounds that the debate is being held in a

public facility and should be considered a I

non-plrlvvate event

Fear and loathing

Union criticizes plan,

By Michele Rhodes
And ‘Marty Willis
The Pitt News

.Describing Pitt Provost Roger Benja-
min‘s recently implemented planning pro-
-cess -as‘ “fundamentally flawed,” United

,Faculty president Phillip Wion, in a news

conference yesterday, expressed what he
called the serious reservations of many
faculty members concerning that plan.
While recognizing the need for establish-
ing academic priorities, Wion said he cannot
accept the current plan because it was
designed by theuniversity administration on
a unilateral basis, without faculty input.
“We’re not against planning," Wion said.
“Decisions here [in the plan] were not made
in the collegial process.” -
United Faculty‘ seeks to bargain collec-

‘ tively for the approximately l,250 faculty in

the provosts’s area. Because the central
issues of faculty salaries and faculty gover-
nance in university decision-making prom-
ise to be dramatically ~ affected by the
provost‘s plan, UF has taken special interest
in responding to the plan, Wion explained.

The provost‘s plan calls for each depart-
ment to reassess its priorities as though it’
had to make a 25-percent budget reduction
and faced no constraints of tenure commit-
ment to veteran professors. B

‘Wion asked why the university adminis-

administrators ‘respond

tration has launched a planning effort that _
P threatens to cut resources at a time when real

income for faculty has eroded 20 percent
over the past 10 years.

United Faculty secretary Mark McCol-
loch cited a steady rise in enrollment astactu-
ally increasing the university's resource base,
thus making the provost’s~drastic cuts seem
arbitrary and unnecessary.

James Cunningham, vice-president ofthe
United Faculty, described the university
governance system as “very authoritarian.”
He questioned the appointment of a l5-
member faculty panel assembled to provide
‘nput during the planning process. The panel
would better serve the process had it been
democratically elected by the faculty rather
than appointed by the administration,

- according to Cunningham‘.

The University Senate Budget Policies
Committee has made repeated reccomenda-
tions for higher salary increases than faculty
actually have received, Wion said. He cited
this as an example of how faculty commit-
tees are structured to make statements that
are only advisory in nature and are non-
binding on the administration. L

“We would _like to see...more detailed
specifications of the ‘faculty consultative
mechanisms’ to be used in the planning pro-
cess,” Wion had said in a March 8 letter to
Provost Roger Benjamin. _

The shortcomings of faculty” governance
systems and the failure of faculty salaries to‘
keep pace with the cost of living are two of

‘Pair of bomb threats  

surprise Pitt campus

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News A g

In what campus police believe are unre-
lated incidents, two bomb threats were
directed at the university yesterday. Both
proved to be false alarms.

At 12:45 p.m., an anonymous caller tele-
phoned the Pittsburgh Police No. 4 Precinct
on Semple and Louisa Streets, warning that
a device would explode on the third floor of

‘ the Cathedral. Campus police were imme-

diately alerted, and detectives were sent to
investigate. After evacuating the entire floor
and conducting a thorough search, they
found nothing.

At 3:40-p.m., an unidentified caller who

denounced university animal research pro-
jects, phoned the campus police communi-
cations center and said that a bomb had been
planted in a pickup truck parked in Pitt’s
O’Hara Street garage.

Campus police. again investigated the
threat and found no explosives. 8

According to James Watters, the assistant
director of public safety of the campus
police, the threats came during- the part of
the year when such events are common.

“We see a marked increase toward the end
of the term, around midterms and finals,"
Watters said. “They also come when we have
labor disturbances.”

Referring to the first threat, Watters
added, “Coming into No. 4 is highly unu-
sual. lt’s related to campus activity and [the
call] is inconsistent in that regard. He indi-
cated he was mad at somebody, but was

rather nondescriptive, not clearly , tied to
anything.” '

Watters did explain that the second threat
could be related to the annual occurrence of
World Day for Animals, which will be
observed this year April 24.

Daniel Kinney, co-chairman of the local
chapter of Mobilization for Animals, which
is sponsoring a protest demonstration April
24 on campus, denied any involvement by
his group in the second threat.

“Bomb threats are not something the
Mobilization for" Animals would do,” he
said. '

Though he did not connect the group to
the second threat, Watters contends that the
upcoming animal rights day coincides with
the second threat.’ “That’s something that
needs to be checked,” he said, “but I would
think that somewheregbehind this call, there
is some tie to that. I '

“The fact that that's coming up would lead
you to believe that it is connected.”

Watters further explained that the*caller
indicated “he was dissatisfied with the way
animals were being treated at Scaife Hall
[Pitt Medical School],”though the caller did
not reveal any group affiliation. p

Watters said police never considered
emptying the Cathedral after responding to
the first bomb threat.

“Our decision of what to evacuate-

depends on the construction of the build-
ing,” he said. “The Cathedral, in particular,
poses much less difficulty; it can withstand a
hell of a lot, basically. It's so solidly con-
structed. We would also disrupt a lot of
activity and maybe stimulate more calls.”

Union criticizes planning

continued from page one

the primary reasons that unioniza-
tion and collective bargaining are
needed at’ Pitt, according to Wion.
“The faculty needs to be organized,”
he said.

“The [provost’s] planning process
pits faculty against each other,”
Wion said, further describing the
process as “demoralizing" and
“divisive.”

In an interview after the news con-
ference, university counsel David
Sullivan defended the provost’s
effort, explaining that the provost’s
mission as the chief planning officer
of the university is to develop a com-
prehensive plan for establishing
priorites and allocating resources.

“The entire planning process was
apparently misrepresented,” Sulli-
van said. He described planning
contingent upon the 25 percent
budget reductions as an exercisethat
would force departments to make
their true priorities clear and to
develop backup plans for a worst-
possible-situational scenario.

The success of the provost’s plan
depends upon faculty input, Sulli-

‘There is never going
to be a day when the
faculty has sole and
total control over
everything that goes
on at this university.
It's too big.’

—- David Sullivan

van said, adding that this is a clear
case of the facu1ty‘s participating in
the governance of the university.

“There is never going to be a day
when the faculty has sole and total
control over everything that goes on
in this university," Sullivan said.
“It's too big. Ofcourse, decisions are
made every day by the administra-
tion without consulting the faculty
that affect the entire university.
There just isn’t time to consult them
on every single decision.”

‘Sullivan continued, “Under no
circumstances, I am told by the pro-
vost. does he contemplate taking
any action that would jeopardize
tenure rights."

When asked to respond to Wion‘s
assertion that salary recommenda-
tions made by the University
Senate's budget policies committee
have consistently been ignored, Sul-
livan said. “That is the most abso-
lutely asinine statement I can
conceive of. What difference is a
union going to make?”

Sullivan and fellow university
counsel Ronald Talarico said the
total amount of money available for
faculty salaries depends to a large
extent. on factors over which the
administration has no control. “A
union can’t change the fact the there
isn’t any more money. A union can’t
change the fact that there are more
Ph.D.’s thanjob openings,” Sullivan
said.

“The important thing is that abso-
lutely nothing would change if there
were a union.”

Running Scared

There seems to be a growing tide of fear in this country. Not a
fear caused by any one thing, just a wave of fear in general, and
it may have a subtle but profound effect upon this nation’s
politics. '

During periods of fear and ‘insecurity, Americans tend to
seek refuge in the institutions which surround them, believing it
is better to live with the system they know rather than to take a
chance on one that they don’t.

Whether this fear is warranted has become relatively unim-
portant. This perception of fear has put the Reagan administra-
tion at an ever-increasing advantage to retain control over the
‘Oval Office.

The International Olympic Committee has beenaffected by
this rash of paranoia. In the upcoming _l984 L.A. games, the
organizers have increased the security contingent that will be
present to 1;an.. unprecedented number. There will be 10,000
participants. being guarded by 17,000 security personnel.

At the grassroots level, there has been a rise in membership
of vigilante and militant groups as well as the appearance of the
so-called survivalists, who store months of food in their home,
keep a handy arsenal, and believe that ‘soon people will lose
faith ‘in money and begin trading in bullets. Whether inten-
tional or not, President Reagan has acted in such a manner so
as to capitalize on this fear. _

The president has had concrete slabs constructed in front of
the White House to prevent anyone from crashing through the
gates with some kind of an armed vehicle. (It’ too bad the
president didn’t have this type of foresight before the Marines
in Lebanon were killed by the explosion from a dynamite-laden
truck.) .

Other federal and local government buildings across the
country have followed suit, turning many beautifully designed
buildings into fortresses in a combat zone waiting for a war.

Americans feel the impact of the increased militancy in
society; a militancy that has not been able to justify itself. There
has not been any substantial increases in violence in this coun-
try. There aren’t people sitting patiently in their Chevys, wait-
ing their turn to try and blow up the president or to sabatoge
the U.S. Post Office.

‘ But the government is still going through the motions that it
is ﬁghting a presumably invisible enemy. The government
creates the atomoshere that there is pending danger. We are in a
war situation, and the country can’t risk a change in leadership.
Or so the theory goes.

Many journalists have complained that Reagan isn‘t cam-
paigning, he is running from the rose garden. Instead, he’s
lettingea heightened, unpublicized national fear campaign for
him. '

Letters To The Editor

The Arabs a

should let
Israel alone

Phyllis Gray in her opinion piece
(Pitt News, 3/30/84) makes the
point that. we have the right to be
informed. This I have no quarrel
with; it is the tradition of both Juda-
ism and Israel to encourage the free
expression of ideas. In fact, I look
forward to hearing exactly why the
university cancelled the Young
Socialists program. Gray’s explana-
tion of “Zionist pressure" is simply
absurd.

However, Gray might start by bet-
ter informing herself. Her under-
standing of Israeli society and the
trauma of the Holocaust are so naive
as to be laughable -— if only her
misinformation didn’t hurt so much.

If the Holocaust was a class strug-
gle, does that mean that Jewish law-
yers of Berlin and the Jewish farmers
of Poland were of the same class?
Can we determine one’s class by ex-
amining one’s Jewish ancestry four
generations back to better choose
who should die, as Hitler did? Can
any country honestly be compared
with Germany’s systematic murder
of a people?

Gray’s viewpoint is so mired in
ideology that she forgets that there
are real human beings involved on
both sides of this conﬂit. Her ﬁnal
statement appears to support the
destruction of the State of Israel.
Israel’s right to -this small piece of
land should not deny others’ rights
to make their lives there; but neither
should nearly the whole Arab world
deny this right to Israel.

Before Gray blindly accepts Abu
.lihad’s (self-proclaimed leader .of
the Munich massacre) claim that all
the Palestinians want is to live in
peace, she should, at the very least,
read the Palestinian Covenant,
which, article by article, denies the
right of Israel to exist, thereby
threatening the lives of Jews
throughout the world. How can
anyone claim to desire peaceful
existence for one people while deny-
ing this right for another people?

Yes, it's good to be informed and
to want peace, but presenting de-
structive information doesn’t help
any of us.

not individuals
breeds racism 

Phyllis Grayfs “From Where I
Stand” (The Pitt News, March 30,
I984) is the most insulting piece to
appear in your opinion pages in
quite some time.

As an individualist, a libertarian
and a firm believer in capitalism
(real capitalism ~ not a “mixed
economy”), I would be a hypocrite
to deny her right to her opinion.
After all, her mind is her private
property. But thre are three mislead-
ing claims in her column.

First is her insistence that the uni-
versity “censored" the film “The
Palestinian.” The university has the

right to decide what takes place on
-university property. Since the uni-
versity neither seized the film nor
had those who wished to show it or
see it arrested, the charge of censor-
ship is inappropriate.

Second, is her low estimation of
individualism. “It makes people self-
centered...," she says; if by “self-
centered” she means ‘lunwilling to
give up something of value without
receiving something of equal value

in return,” then I’m all for self- ’

centeredness. But Ms. Gray goes on
to claim that this rational form of
living makes people bigoted: “If a
person is seen to be different, we
tend to shy away and criticize the
differences in the other person.”The
truth is that to an individualist,
equality is the acceptence of differ-
ences, while to _a collcctivist, “equal”
means “interchangeable.” (Does
“All persons are created interchan-
geable” sound as funny to you as it
does to me?) It is collectivism, not
individualism, which creates racism,
and Hitler was a collectivist.

This brings me to the third point.
Contrary to Ms. Gray’s.insulting
claim, Hitler was no capitalist; he
railed against free markets and
“Jewish capitalism.” He named his
brand of fascism “national social-
ism,” as anyone who makes the
“careful study of history," which
Ms. Gray recommends, will dis-
cover. Hitler‘s collectivism
expressed itself in such anti-
individualistic slogans as “You are
nothing, your people are every-

0 thing" and “Work [not private prop-
erty] makes freedom.”

Americans and Soviets; unite

As voters, we have often heard
candidates for the presidency call for
“new ideas.” Gary Hart is not an
original. He has only caught the
attention of the press and the voters
as something new and bright.

In the past, new ideas rarely came
to be; they were actually only old
ideas cast in different rhetoric. This
past experience makes me somewhat
skeptical of anyone promising “new
ideas," at least skeptical with respect
to whether the ideas are actually
new. -

This approach is a little better,
fresh and more appealing than Mon-
dale’s old ideas, still related in famil-
iar rhetoric.

Reagan, of course, never made

any pretext that his ideas were new.
They are not. But what if someone
said he had “new ideas” and was
serious about it? What would be
desirable? I enjoy and know more
about international affaris; thus,
this is where my dreams lie.
America's leaders have always
acted as if power or inﬂuence and
the balance between them were what
made the world go around. Before
World War II, there were many.cen-
ters of inﬂuence in the world. Today,
there are presumed to be two cen-
ters. We therefore act as if whatever
goes against U.S. interests (wha-
tever they may be) must go for
Soviet ‘interests (whatever they,
too, may be). In essence, there is

only one world pie to cut up and thus
a finite number of shares. This is
called zero-sum.

Listen to Reagan's rhetoric and
watch the United States behavior
abroad. This belief is spelled out.
But what if this notion were not
true‘? This perception of reality then
may only be a self-fulfilling pro-
phecy. This is where my desire for
“new ideas“ begins.

The world is not zero—sum by
nature. There is not a deterministic
balance between the United States
and the Soviet Union. What is per-
ceived as a blow to U.S. interests is
not, therefore, always in the Soviet
Union’s interest. The only thing that
guarantees this is U.S. policy reflect-

to end bi-polarity

ing the belief of a zero-sum world.
As an example: by directing hos-
tile action toward a rebel movement
or state, the group is often forced to
side with another state as a response
to U.S. resources. The Soviet Union
has many resources and often is the
state to which the group turns for aid
(there are others that can give aid
and often do, but it is the Soviet aid
on which we focus). We (the U.S.)
then point to the evidence of Soviet
aid as a proof that they are behind
the group. Therefore, the group
must be at odds with U.S. interests.
This is a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. If
the U.S., at the beginning, did not
pursue hostile policy towards the
group, the results may have been dif-

ferent. They may not have gone to
the Soviets for aid. They could have
gone elsewhere.

In this situation, the U.S. could
take a neutral position or offer only
non-military aid to the side oppos-
ing the rebels (this is only a label).
Thus, the rebels would not be forced
into Soviet hands. Not all states or
groups desire to be involved with the
U.S. or U.S.S.R. They are only
doing so as a result of the U.S. and
U.S.S.R. pushing on them to make a
choice. If one side does not push, a
choice will not be necessary.

It is not all U.S. or U.S.S.R.! This
is a new idea that-truly would be new
to U.S. leaders. It has not been tried
before!

From where I stand/ Timothy Hunter

Reagan and conservative politics, a right turn

It seems as though many people
around this campus feel that the
opinions presented in this paper are
mostly from a non-conservative
point of view.

As a Republican and, I suppose, a
conservative too, l‘d like to make,
for whatever they’re worth, a few
comments on some of the latest
issues that have been ﬂoating
around the news.

The most colorful ofthese issues is
the race for the Democratic Party
nomination. According to News-
week, this is not a race; it’s a battle.
“Hart and Mondale were like two
gladiators thrashing about in the
dark, desperately trying to score
points with a mercurial electorate
and using invective and innuendo as
their chosen weapons,” said the arti-
cle.

As all of the classical gladiators
did in the past, these two gladiators
will eventually be defeated by their
opponent, Ronald Reagan.

Reagan’s most powerful weapons,
of course, are his opponents; they
will defeat themselves. Their ridicu-
lous rhetoric about ground ham-
burger is stifled by policies that have
done wonders for the stock market,
brought inflation down, employ-
ment up, and, as recent reports

reveal, brought sharp increases in
corporate outlays — insuring a
strong and stable economy.

Some believe Reagan is a little
harsh on the Soviets. Dr. Peter, in
The Pitt News March 28, said,
“Americans have to realize the
majority of people in the U.S.S.R.
are neither barbarians nor potential
defectors.” Reagan does not believe
the people of Russia are a threat; the
threat is the corrupt leaders of the
Soviet's Communist .Party. These
leaders, such as Konstantin Cher-
nenko, are deadly bumbling idiots.

“Chernenko not only stumbled
and stuttered through his own 45-
minute [campaign] speech, he also
managed to get confused and omit a
critical passage on U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions  He frequently lost his place.
‘Well-organized, persistent work
yields, uh, er, yields, uh, fruit,‘ he
read," reported Newsweek.

This type of leader has the power
to order invasions of troops into
Afghanistan or order pilots to shoot
civilian planes out of the sky. This is
the type of leader that Reagan
wishes to squelch.

While Reagan is silently defeating
Hart and Mondale, there is one —
other candidate running in the
Democratic race, Reverend Jessie

Jackson. In this election year, he
doesn‘t stand a chance. Why is he
still running? He probably feels he
can win the Democratic nomination

in 1988. This feeling was made
known in the early seventies, when,
according to Life, Jackson stated
‘The issues ain’t no more to save the
Democrats; the issue is not to save
the Republicans; but the democracy
and the republic are at stake, and
unless someone rises ith the power to
reconcile black and while, young”
and old, he is not qualified to save
the nation.” At least he isn‘t repeat-
ing silly television commercials.

It doesn’t really matter who wins
the Democratic nomination in 1988;
he or she will still losc.to Senator
Jack Kemp for the presidency.

There are a few others who feel
they can become president in 1984,
such as Sonia Johnson. March 30's
issue of The Pitt News reported that
she fasted for 37 days in Illinois to
win passage of the ERA. It appears

as though she will make a great pres-
ident. With all of the problems that
arise in the world, she and everyone
else in her cabinet would be dead of
starvation within the first few
months of her office. So much for

fanatics. _ _
The ERA is good if it ensures

equality between men and women. it
will never become part of the Consti-
tution, however, for reasons such as
those presented by Mrs. Anley
Oberdick in The Pitt News, March
30. She said the amendment doesn't
clarify subjects such as drafting
women, legal status of divorced
owmen and the demands of homo-
sexuals.

The amendment also does not
clarify what should be done with the
organizations such as the Boy
Scouts or Girl Scouts; should they
become one organization‘? What
about Pitt's football team — should
girls have to compete against 6-5,
285-lb. Bill Fralics?

What should be done with those
people who engage in activities such
as bestiality, homosexuality or
incest among consenting adults? If
they don‘t harm anyone, nothing
should be done; unless, of course,
they ask for help.

California, a state where one
might consider this type of activity
rather common, just rejected
another bill that would ensure no
discrimination against these people
in the job market; this bill has been
rejected for the past seven years.
Even California doesn't wish to pro-

mote this-type of activity, which, I
suppose, is not that shocking
anyway.

Abortion is murder. I can't prove
that it is, but it can't be proven
beyond reasonable doubt that it
isn't.

John Hinckley was sentenced to _a
psychiatric hospital rather than pri-
son because he could not be proven
guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Fctuses are not guilty, beyond rea-
sonable doubt, of not being humans;
why are they put to death’?

A few weeks ago, The Pittsburgh
Press reported a story about a wom-
an’s baby daughter who was eaten
by their pet dog. The story explained
that this woman was not very upset
about this incident — the death of
her daughter. She was upset when
the authorities wanted to kill the
dog. She explained she could always
have another child, but she could
never get another dog like her pres-
ent one. This women’s indifferent

attitude for the life of her child is the ’

same attitude of the pro-abortionist,
or, as they euphemistically call
themselves, pro-choicers.

So there you have it, the opinions
of a Republican conservative,
always with room for improvement,
always ready to change — but not
too easily.

It Can Be.

It you can point, you can use a Macintosh. .The screen
layout resembles a desktop, with pictures you'll
easily recognize, like file folders, note pads, and a
trash can. Apple added a pointer on the screen. and
attached the pointer to a "mouse". As you move the
mouse with your hand. you move the pointer on the
screen. To tell the Macintosh what to do. you simply
move the mouse until you're pointing to the object or
function you want. Click the button on top of the
mouse. and you instantly begin working with that
object: open a file folder, and read the papers inside.
Whether you're working with words, numbers, or
even pictures Macintosh always works the same way.
with the simple point-and-click oi the mouse, you
can add an illustration lrom one software program to
the text of another, chart the path to completion on a
project, or change the width of a column on a
spreadsheet.

You just have to be smart enough to buy one.

vice-presidentof his fraternity, Phi
Beta Sigma, and an active member
of the NAACP.

“I have been involved in many
leadership roles, and I feel that I can
use my skills to help the Black

Action Society at the university,” he
said.

“Black students have a responsi-
bility to the black community. We
must take what we learned from
school and take it to the black com-
munity and teach to others what we
have learned,” he explained.

Other areas upon which Coleman
said he will concentrate include
involving black fraternities and sor-
orities in BAS, organizing a newslet-
ter to let students know of events
and planning voter
drives.

Gladys Brown, a political science
major, said that building up the
organization’s political action com-
mittee, which was established last
year, is a plan of action she wants to
get underway.

“This program will deal with voter
registration, minorify recruitment at
Pitt and student retention,” Brown
said. I’m going to see if the Black
Action Society can work with

registration '

admissions in recruiting minorities
from the Pittsburgh area.”
Coleman replaces acting chair-
man Darryl Davis. During Davis’
administration, the organization
dealt with the issues of black student
retention and securing prominent
black figures to speak at commence-
ment exercises. *

A black person has never received
an honorary degree at commence-
ment, according to Davis.

Davis said he will still play an
active role at the university. He is the
only student appointed to the finan-
cial subcommittee of the University
Senate. After the inauguration,
Davis will continue looking for ways
to better minority recruitment.

Before Brown was elected to her
post, she was the executive secretary
for the BAS and conducted the
organization’s correspondence.

“I had to know how the whole

organization was run,” she said. _

“That is how I got interested in run-
ning for co-chairman."

First recognition of deaf

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

In an effort to bring the hearing
and the deaf communities closer
together, Pitt’s Sign Connection
Deaf Awareness Club and Disabled
Student Services co-sponsered Pitt‘s
first annual Deaf Awareness Day
yesterday in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom.

“Many students shy away from
deaf people because they don't know
how to relate to them,” said deaf
awareness secretary Debbie Mad-
ara.

The sign language and deaf
awareness clubs, according to club
president Jeff Pannier, attempts to
provide academic and social life for
deaf students and teaches people
how to communicate socially with
the deaf community through Ameri-
can sign language, the most com-
mon language of the deaf.

Throughout the ballroom, organ-
izations such as the Pennsylvania

symbols to represent ideas and con-
cepts, the communication gap
between the hearing world and the
deaf community will gradually dis-
appear, Pannier _said._

' Many students participated in
yesterday’s festivities.

“Beautiful Hands,“ an entertain-
ment group ofstudents who perform
in sign language, acted out many
songs and medleys in an effort to
provide a broader means of expres-
sion for the deaf and to show that
emotions and feelings can be
expressed through sign language.

The group began in I980 as aclass
project in a sign language class at
Pitt, acording to Miss Deaf Pennsyl-
vania Karen Walkney, who estab-
lished “Beautiful Hands.” The
group, she said, is fulfillment of her
life-long dream to create a perform-
ing group to spread deaf awareness.

David Parker, director of a sim-
ilar performing group called “Break-
through,” also performed at the
Deaf Awareness Day program. Too
many times, he said, students are not

aware of the services for the deaf.
“Our goal IS to make students sen-

sitive but not sympathetic toward

 

 
 

Basement,

deaf people on campus."

Bill Parise, the parent of a deaf
child, spoke to the audience about
the importance of educating not
only the children, but the parents as
well.

“Parents cannot ignore the com-

munication gap between themselves »

and their deaf child,“ he said. “Right
now, teachers are not trained to
work with parents of hearing-
impaired children, but they will have
to be trained so that parents can
communicate with their children.”

At one table, Westinghouse repre-
sentative John Russel displayed var-
ious telecommunication systems
which could enable deaf people to
communicate with others by tele-
phone. Through a sign language
interpreter, he said that Deaf
Awareness Day is a very good way
to show the hearing people what
deaf people do.

“Too many people view deaf peo-
ple as abnormal and different, and
deaf people live the same way as
hearing people. Deaf Awareness
Day is merely a way of asking for
support and understanding toward
the deaf community."

Dead man
idenﬁﬁed

The identity of a man found
dead in the William Pitt Union
on Sunday was released yester-
day by the Allegheny County
Coroner’s Office. The man has
been identified as 35-year-old
Mark Harris of Pittsburgh, Pa.

Following an autopsy on
Monday, the coroner reported
that Harris’ death was caused by
heart failure. Campus police ser-
geant Walt Waters said the
police would accept the report
and ‘stop their investigation of
Harris. They have not released
an address for Harris, but list his
residence at his mother‘s Squirrel
Hill home. The police released
no work history, police record or
other means of identification.

The disorder in Saudi Arabia has
become_intense, Kuwait has fallen
and it looks like the Saudi govern-
ment will Iose its control any day.

‘ The Saudis look to the United States

for help, and U.S. troops move in.
The Russians may recognize that the
measure is intended only to help
Saudi Arabia, but they may decide
the presence ofthe U.S. signiﬁes our
interest in watching the Soviet
Union.

Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll,
Jr., the deputy director for the Cen-

ter for Defense Information, pres- '

ented this scenario of World War
Three at Pitt yesterday during a lec-
ture entitled “Peace Through
Strength: ,The Ultimate Paradox."

“In my military and _ political
appraisal of the situation,” Carroll
said, “the Soviets will’ not tolerate
U.S. military presence in theregion,

warns against military solutions

and there will be a U.S.-Soviet
conflict.”

In formulating Mideast policy, he
said, the United States has one over-
riding interest. “We are committed
to the survival of Israel. Israel exists
and we guarantee its existence. This
makes difficult every other action we
make in the entire region."

United States actions in the region
include the selling of nuclear and
conventional weapons to Mideast
nations, including Israel and various
Arab states.

“This is the paradox," Carroll
said. “We guarantee the existence of
the State of Israel, yet we are arming
almost every Moslem state in the
region.

“We are arming some of them
totally unresponsive to their security
needs,“ he said.

ing in the Korean War and spending
six years in Vietnam. He was direc-

The conflicts in the Middle East

he said, and Lebanon is a perfect

powerful position,” he said. Because
of their enemies and demographic
and economic problems. Carroll

said, “Its very difficult to see the

long-term security of Israel.

“The United States certainly has a
role to play in the Middle East if we
are far-sighted and work for long-
term resolutions instead of working
toward military solutions. They
won‘t work," he said.

He said the Soviet Union won‘t
take anything by military force if
they can do it by taking a more
peaceful, long—term approach. “The
U.S.S.R., if nothing else, is very con-
servative when it comes to military
risks,“ he said.

He labelled as “rationalization”

the argument that if we don’t sell .

weapons to the Mideast countries,
someone else will. ’

“The United States is the most

said. “We ought to be exerting our

Pitt professor Ted Windt, an
expert in presidental rhetoric and
frequent consultant to political cam-
paigns, thinks tomorrow's debate
will depend largely on the final New
York tally.

“I think the debate at Columbia
[March 25] dissolved into acrimony,

, with Jesse Jackson as the peace-

maker," said Windt. _“The initial
primaries tend to be run on safe
issues. We are now in the second
phase. and it is beginning to become,
well. testy.

“Now they are attacking one
another, and Gary Hart has been put
on the defensive.”

Windt has seen many presidental
candidates visit college campuses,
and he knows what people are likely
to hear tomorrow.

“Students will hear the standard
campaign speech, which every can-
didate has to-have because he does
so many of them,” Windt said.
“Both Jackson and Hart, and "Mon-
dale if he decides to to visit here, will
have to gear that to the concerns of
young people‘.

“They most likely will gear their
speeches toward criticism of Ronald
Reagan and his cuts in education
and student aid.“

Windt said that he was not at all
surprised that the debate came to
Pittsburgh. He said that former
president Jimmy Carter always con-
sidered this one of his favorite states.

“In any democratic candidacy,
Pittsburgh has to be considered as
important as Philadelphia," Windt
said. ,

Q: What game takes at least two to three

hours to play, costs around $35 and is the

hottest on today's market?
% A: Triuial Pursuit.
l Six thousand trivia questions are
posed in Trivial Pursuit, a board game
which has taken the market by storm. it
is the most populars“thinking game”
since Dungeons and Dragons, yet Trivial
Pursuit isn’t as difficult.

The game can be found in stores
beside the Cabbage Patch Kids —— that is,
they are nowhere to be found. You must
join a long waiting list and possibly offer
a deposit. It takes anywhere from two
weeks to two months for the game to
come in and your name to be reached
, on the list. 0
 i ‘‘very rarely will one find the game just
sitting on the shelf,” said a salesperson
from the Toy Soldier in Fox Chapel. ‘fwe
 A, had a shipment of 24 games come in
A, just lastweek, and they were all gone 0
‘ within 24 hours.”

‘ Trivial Pursuit reached its peak of
popularity right after Christmas, accord-
ing to a saleswoman from S.W. Randall T
Toyes and Gifts in'Squirrel Hill. Waiting
lists have grown and flourished ever
since.

The game can be played by two
people or 24 people, according to the
directions. A playing board, one die, six
player tokens, 36 scoring wedges and
1,00() question and answer cards are
included with the $35 cost.   T

The playing board shows a circle that ’
resembles a wagon wheel, with six
spokes extending from the center, or

The game that has Pitt s;

‘hub. The circle and spokes are divided
into six color categories, which represent
’ the six categories of questions.

Geography, Entertainment, History, Art
and Literature, Science and Nature, and
Sports and Leisure categories are
included with the set. Additional catego-
ries may be purchased.

There are many conceptions of what
makes the game so popular and fun to
play. -

“The questions are interestingand fun
to listen to,” said Pitt student Pam Hanlin,
who plays the game regularly.

The Toy Soldier salesperson bases its
popularity on the fact that “it tests your  
knowledge in a fun way while learning
things at the sametime.”

“It’s surprising the knowledge you
retain without actually studying it, you
just know the answer from hearsay,”
said Curt Stauffer, a freshman business
major at Pitt.

Trivial Pursuit is a time-consuming
game. “lt’s a fun and a challenging‘
game, but it takes too long,” said pre-
dental student John Dever. Most games
last at least two or three hours and can
last up to six or seven hours.

The game can become boring with the
long sitting, but players say that a few
days away from the game are a sure-fire
remedy.

That’s another thing that makes the
game so popular. It rarely becomes
repetitious; there are more than enough
questions from which to choose.

It’s a good idea to see the game before
buying it because of it's price and
availability, but if you are a trivia buff,
this is definitely the game for you.

Rowe has been a United States representative at seven international competi-
tions, and she is considered a prime ‘competitor at the annual United States
Nationals.

In an interview with The Washington Post, Rowe said, “I tend to be one

of those who shoots well in competition —— but not No. l.” Rowe, however,
has proved herself wrong. She claimed the No. 1 position on the 1984
National Archery Team, demonstrating her ability as a competitor in
the Olympics, to be held thissummer in Los Angeles.
Rowe’s personal gains from her competitions are not only
her celebrity status and titles. As a child, Rowe said she
was shy. Archery has given her a chance to prove. her
ability to herself and to others. “There were holes in
my life that I used archery to ﬁll up. I wasn‘t shoot-

the time element of practicing is her biggest gripe. “I’m getting a little tired of
knowing that during the summer, I’ve got to block out time to practice. When
you’re away, all the continuity that develops over the years — friends and work

Panther netters deal

with extremes in split    

By Jim Pletr-as

ThePittNews

The Pitt men‘s tennis team has
played the extremes in the past two
days.. On Monday, it played a strong
team from Akron University, and
yesterday, the Panthers faced a weak
Duquesne squad.

As would, be expected, the results
correlated with the opponent’s rela-
tive strength.

Duquesne provided little compe-
tition for the Panthers, as Pitt shut
out the Dukes 9-0. So dominating
were the Panthers that the Dukes
did not come close to winning a sin-
gle set.

It was the type of match the
Panthers needed after the’ match
with Akron, where Pitt was defeated
7-2 at the Trees courts on Monday.
It helped them tolpractice shots they
ordinarily wouldn't have, and in_
general, it was a confidence booster.

Akron (I4-7), described by
coach Georgei Dieffenbaeh as “a
great team,” soundly defeated t-he
Panthers. With the exception of No.
1 singles player Dave Johnson, the
squad didn‘t play up to its potential.

Johnson was the only bright spot,
winning a hard-fought three-set
match over Francis Poirier 2-6, 6-0,
6-3. Johnson played well after drop-
ping the first set, hustling after every
point.

The ' highlight of his match
occurred with Johnson up 4-3 in the
third set, down 40-30 on Poirier’s
serve. The freshman proceeded to
win the next three points, giving him
the game and a 5-3 lead. On match
point, Johnson hit a difficult back-
hand volley on the run into the open

court, which was ‘typical of his play

in the last two sets.

Dieffenbach was extremely
pleased with Johnson’s play.
“Dave played inspired and very

smart tennis," \ Dieffenbach‘ said. ,

“He also moved much better than
normal.” '

The Panthers may have been able
to make the score closer, but they
were without the services of No. 3
singles Jack Kalla, who is out for the
year with a torn cartilage in his knee,
suffered in Sunday’s match against
George Washington.

“It was difficult to play without

‘Jack ‘because everybody had to‘

move up a spot," Johnson said.
This meant that people had to
play against competition of a higher

level. It also created prolems with

the doubles pairings because every-
body was playing with a different
partner.

Kalla‘s loss will hurt the team’s
chances in the remaining ﬁve
matches, especially going into
Thursday's away match against a
powerful West Virginia squad.

of the team. L

“I do think it will hurt us, but we

“Our next two matches [WVU

Clancy lowers the boom

By Charlie O’!-lara 7
The Pitt News

A genuine athlete is someone who
can excel in any sport under any
condition.

Webster’s_could have put Sam
Clancy’s picture beside the diction-
ary deﬁnition.

The 6-7, 260-lb. Clancy was an
honorable mention All-America
basketball player at Pitt, where he
starred from 1977-81. He holds the
school career rebounding mark and

was member of the 1979 United._

States Pan American Games team.

Currently, Clancy is aidefensive

ball League.
“I’ve played against just about

‘everybody in the league, and he’s a

great player,” said Dale Markham,
the 6-9, 285-lb. offensive right tackle
of the Oakland Invaders who was
face-to-face with Clancy for much of
Sunday afternoon’s game at Three
Rivers Stadium. “I think once he

gets some more experience, he'll be
one of the best in the league.”

Clancy began his professional
basketball career when he was
chosen by the Phoenix Suns in the
third round of the National Basket-
ball Association draft in the summer
of 1981. He was released, however,
just before the team broke from its
training camp. A

He went on to play for Billings of
the Continental Basketball Associa-
tion, where he averaged I3 points
and eight rebounds per game.

In the spring of 1982, the Seattle
Seahawks of the National Football
League (NFL) were in dire need of
someone to play tight end when
former Pitt football coach Jackie
Sherrill mentioned Clancy as a
possibility.

The Seahawks made Clancy their

llth pick in the draft. He spent his _

first year with the club on the injured
reserve list after suffering a knee
injury during training camp.

“I think that was the best thing
that could have happened to me,”
Clancy said. “It gave me a chance to
really learn what professional foot-
ball is all about."

For the 1983 season, Clancy was
switched to defensive end and
played on passing situations as an
additional pass rusher. He recorded
a sack in’ a December playoff game
with the Denver Broncos.

Immediately following the NFL
season, Clancy signed with the
Maulers.

Clancy currently leads the Maul-
ers ‘(Z-4) in solo tackles with 42 —-
an average of seven per game — and
in sacks with ﬁve.

Mauler defensive line coach
Frank Lauterbur said that if Clancy
continues his rapid improvement, he
would soon become a dominating
player.

Clancy played football in high
school for Brashear and earlier for
Fifth’ Avenue before it closed down.
While at‘Brashear he was selected as
a member of the Parade All-
America team. At Pitt, he never
played during the regular season,
but did participate in spring drills as

_ a senior.

He made the transition from high
school football to collegiate basket-
ball to professional football.

“The transition was really hard.
especially the first year in Seattle,’
Clancy said. “I learned a lot in that
year, but I never realized just how
complicated pro football really is.

“I‘ve been ableto use a lot of the
skills that I learned in basketball to
‘help me as a defensive player. It‘s
certainly a lot easier to use some of
the ‘shake-n-bake‘ moves on some of
these huge offensive linemen.”

Another adjustment Clancy has
made is to that of team player rather
than the role of star. In high school
and Pitt, he was the center of atten-
tion. Game plans were designed with
Clancy as the focal point.

“It's great to have the opportunity
to be a part of a new tradition,” he
said. “When I came to Pitt, they said
that they would build the team
around me. Here, there are a. lot of
great players. I want to become one
of the greatest defensive lineman in
the game, but I'm not that yet and
want to help the team in any way I

Goalies key in Cup chase

By Marty Willis
The Pitt News

Okay, true hockey fans. You can
come out of the woodwork now. It's
been a long and boring National
Hockey League season, especially
for thoseof us cursed by being Pen-
guin fans.

The real fun begins tonight, when
the league’s second season -— the
Stanley Cup playoffs — begins in
eight cities. The 80-game regular
season means nothing now, as each
of the 16 playoff teams start from
scratch, each with a viable shot at
bringing home the Cup - or so the
popular theory goes.

The fact is that only six or seven
clubs are legitimate contenders for
the Cup this year. Of course, the
dynastic New York Islanders, who
have won the championship for the
last four years, must be considered
the favorite again.

Pittsburgh fans generally cite the
Islanders as the team they most love
to hate, ever since they shocked the
Penguins in the 1975 playoffs with
four straight victories. It was a blow
from which the Penguin franchise
never recovered. Still, you can’t help
but admire an islander team that
consistently delivers with hard
work, timely scoring, and great
clutch goaltending by Billy Smith.

This year, only Edmonton, Bos-
ton, Washington, Buffalo, Quebec
and Philadelphia stand a reasonable

    
     

The other entries, from Minnesota
to Vancouver, are out of the
running.

Here’s why: Playoff upsets are
rare in the first round. Despite the
fact that a weaker team can benefit
from a shorter, five-game series by
coming up with a hot goaltender,
only two of eight underdogs got past
the first round last year. This time
around, two first-round upsets
could occur, but not any more.

The reason is goaltending. Crazy
as it sounds, if you can accurately
evaluate each team’s goalies, you’ve
finished most of the work necessary
to predict the outcome of a series.
Last year, this writer was a sports
announcer at WPGH radio and used
the all-goalie theory to pinpoint
seven of eight winners in the first
round and four of four in the second
round.

The most notable lesson from
1983 was that a team like the lowly
Rangers, who finished fourth in the
Patrick division, could eliminate a
powerful Philadelphia Flyer squad
that had finished second in a 21-
team league during the regular sea-
son. What most folks had not
realized was that any team relying
on rookies at both of its goalie spots
will be on the golf course after the
opening playoff round.

Now that that’s clear, this season’s J

playoff picks:

New York Islanders over New
York Rangers. With veterans like
Mike Bossy, Bryan Trottier and
Dennis Potvin, plus Smith in goal, it

Washington over Philadelphia.
The Caps led the league with a 2.82
goals-against‘ average and eight
shutouts, four each by Pat Riggin
and Al Jensen, who finished first
and third, respectively, in goaltend-
ing. The Flyers had won eight
straight games prior to the playoffs,
but lost to Washington 4-1 on the
last day of the season.

. Boston over Montreal. The Cana-
diens have been blown out of the
opening playoff round for three
straight years, and that was before
this year’s disaster, when they ﬁn-
ished w_ith a record of 35-40-5, their
worst in decades. No contest at all.

Quebec over Buffalo. Now, this
one is risky. If the Nords win, it will
be an upset. Buffalo has the league’s
second—best netminding, but the
Sabres’ top goalie, Tom Barrasso, is
a rookie. Buffalo had its best season
in years, but so did Quebec. The rati-
onale behind this pick is rooted in
Quebec’s 6-0-1 record against Buf-
falo during the regular season, along
with its 4-l victory over the Sabres
last Saturday.

Edmonton over Winnipeg. The
Oilers have Wayne Gretsky. The
Oilers have Glenn Anderson, Mark
Messier, Jari Kurri and Paul Coffey.
They also have two good goalies to
the Jets’ one. They compiled an 8-0-
0 record this year against the Jets.
Enough said.

Calgary over Vancouver. Calgary
lost its most dominant player, Kent
Nilsson, for the playoffs because ofa
recent injury. Still, goalie Rejean

Panthers
enjoy the
spnng

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

Finally, spring has begun in Pitts-
burgh. The last two days have been
ideal spring days, with bright sun-
shine and temperature in the ﬁfties.

For Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis, the change has been a wel-
come sight, especially after coming
back from playing five games in
Florida, only to spend a week
indoors and see two doubleheaders
washed out because of inclement
weather.

“It’s great to be playing on a field,
swinging a bat," Lewis said. “The
pitchers can come out, throw a ball
around, and get back their timing
and location.”

The dry conditions, however,
have come at an unfortunate time.
This is the last week for classes, and
the university and Lewis refused to
reschedule games during this time.

“The last week is the most impor-
tant of a term,” he said.

So the Panthers are hoping for the
- -- = ' ."‘“‘““  weather conditions of the past three
, , , Tlm M.0ersh./The Pm News days to return this weekend. Pitt has

Carnegie-Mellon visits Trees Field
Sunday for a twin bill.

Forthe time being, Lewis has
played intrasquad games to give the
pitchers an opportunity to throw in
simulated game situations.

There are problems playing
against teammates, though. “You
have mixed emotions in these
games,” Lewis said. “If someone hits
the ball well, you wonder about the
pitching, and if a pitcher strikes out V
- . batters, you wonder about the
f ‘ T hitting.

‘ _ “Also, it's difficult to play with

mates. It’s hard to get fired up.”

excited about the season. Even

5th Cup

continued from page seventeen
Lemelin had his best year ever, while
Canuck goalies Richard Brodeur
and John Garrett each surrendered
over four goals per game. These
teams may be basically even other-
wise, but defense counts the most in
the playoffs.

Chicago over Minnesota. This is
the second upset alluded to above.
Minnesota has won its division, but
only finished a few games over .500.
Chicago suffered through a woeful
season but recently welcomed star
left wing Al Secord back to the
lineup after he recovered from a
major injury. Again, goaltending
will be crucial. Black Hawk goalie
Murray Bannerman gave up only
3.38 goals per game this year, while
Gilles Meloche and Don Beaupre of
Minnesota allowed 4.18 and 4.12,
respectively.

St. Louis over Detroit. Because
neither team is very good, this is a
close one. Detroit had a triumphant
year in comparison with the past few
years, yet managed to blow its last
two games last weekend against Chi~
cago and finish below the Blues, who
finished below the .500 mark. St.
Louis goaltender Mike Liut is the
only reason the Blues should look
forward to a second playoff round.

In the second round, the winners
will be the Islanders, Bruins, Oilers
and Black Hawks. In the semifinals,
look for New York and Edmonton

to survive for a rematch of last year’s

final.

Because Smith and Roland
Melanson hold the distinct edge
over Oilers goalies Andy Moog and
Grant Fuhr, the four—time cham-
pions should complete a successful
drive for five. Even ifpeople in Pitts-
burgh hate them.

 ‘Jack of all trades’ finds

satisfaction in competition

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Jan Marcus modestly calls him-
self a “jack of all trades, master of
none."

Contrary to his self-proclaimed

mediocrity, Marcus has already met
with unexpected success. Enthusi-
asm radiates from this English writ-
ing major whose cerebral palsy has
not stopped himfrom enjoying a
multi-faceted career at Pitt.

He works in the athletic ticket
office and has ambitions of obtain-
ing a master’s degree in athletic
administration in order to become
an athletic director.

Marcus just returned Monday
from a stint in Florida as manager
for the Panther baseball squad. “I
chase -balls and handle travel
arrangements, uniforms and passing
out meal money,” said Marcus.

Still, there was something missing
from his life. Competition. It was all
around him. He looked after ath-
letes, watched them compete and
even assisted in getting spectators to
watch these physically active collegi-

e ans engage in competition.

» tion

“I ’m still really ﬂoating. I never thought I ’d
experience the kind of high you get from

competing. ”

--Jan Marcus

“I wanted to become involved
somehow,” Marcus said. “My doc-
tor, Dr. Richard Ray [the baseball
team physician], wanted me to lift. I
really had to decide for myself.

Marcus began a weightlifting
workout with Dr. Warren Sipp,
strength—gaining specialist and
adaptive physical education instruc-
tor at Trees Hall. Sipp encouraged
Marcus to become involved in com-
petition for the handicapped.

In January, Marcus was informed
that the Pittsburgh Sports Liability
games were to be held March 10 at
Reizenstein Middle School in East
Liberty. Sponsored by Pittsburgh
Parks and Recreation, the competi-
included several swimming
events. He decided to train for the
50- and I00-meter freestyle.

Marcus had never before com-
peted in a swim meet. Enter David
Belowich, Pitt women’s swimming
coach.

“I outlined a workout for him,”
Belowich said. “Marcus told me he
had a competition, and he had a
short period of time to train for it.”

Every athlete is placed in one of
eight divisions based on age and
ability. Marcus was entered in Div-
ision 7, age 21. Though initially told
he was “Not handicapped enough,”
Marcus was allowed to compete and
won both events.

“I gave him some solid tips, but it
wasn’t the training program,” said
Belowich, “it was the desire of the
person in the program [that enabled
Marcus to win]."

Marcus emphasized Belowich’s
crucial role at a time when the
women’s swim team was in the midst
of the Big East competition which
Pitt won.

“He helped me out a great deal. I
needed some help preparing for [the
competition], and he always had

- time to talk to me."

‘‘I’m still really floating. I never
thought I’d experience the kind of
high you get from competing,” said
Marcus.

His presence in the weight room
did not go thoroughly unnoticed
during October and November.
“They snickered under their
breaths,” Marcus said. “They didn’t
actually say it, but I’m sure they
thought ‘he‘ll be here a week and
leave.” It kind of bothered them to
be around someone who was out of
shape."

The snickers have stopped, espe-
cially now that Marcus is compet-
ing. His winning times at the
Pittsburgh Sports Liability Games
qualified him for the Pennsylvania
Keystone State competition to be
held in July or August. All athletes,
regardless of disability,,are able to
participate in the state competition.

Marcus said that he’ll be training
all summer for the Keystone Games.
His present workout schedule
includes swimming in the morning
and lifting in the afternoon.

Marcus said that he has learned a
lot from the competition. “I learned
more than the feel of competing. l’ve
learned how lucky I am and what
really good friends I have. It just
shows that everything is relative -
anyone can compete regardless of
physical and mental [handicaps].

“It’s made me aware of my han-
dicap and what I can do in spite of
it."

The Pitt News, Wednesday, April 4, I984

‘Shirk, Spector compete in

national gym championships

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

Lisa Shirk and Alisa Spector,
Pitt's premier women gymnasts, will
be ﬂying to California today to com-
pete in the NCAA National Gym-
nastics championship to be held this

‘ weekend at UCLA.

This weekends national cham-
pionship meet will showcase the
nation’s 10 best collegiate teams as
well as the I0 best individual per-
formers from across the country.

Contributing heavily in the latter
category will be Pitt, which will send
No. I seed Shirk and No. 7 Spector
into the individual competition.

Good scores at the regional com-
petion and throughout the year gave
Pitt’s gymnasts the right to compete
on Friday in the first round of the
meet. The first or optional round
will slim the field from ten to eight in
team and individual competion.The
top eight will then go to the ﬁnals.

In the individual competition, the’
top six will automatically become
All-America award winners. Shirk
and Spector will both compete in a
rotation immediately following a
qualifing team so they do not have to
compete alone.

Spector will start at 5:30 and will
act as the last member of the Utah
rotation. Shirk will begin at 7:30
and, in similar fashion, will trail the
Georgia team. Lady Panther gym-
nastics coach Donna Sanft said she
thinks trailing the other teams will
be an advantage to her gymnasts
because they should look better than
the team members who compete
before them. .

Sanft went on to say that it should
be interesting to see how her gym-
nasts, and the team in general, com-
pare to the teams that will be present
at the competion. Pitt missed send-
ing the entire team to the competi-
tion by two-tenths of a point, and
according to Sanft, was edged out

 

“I just feel no one’s
going to really notice
me. I’ll just mingle
with the Georgia
team.”

--Lisa Shirk

only because of the regional
bracketing.

“Even though we didn't qualify,
we had the l0th-highest composite
score in the country. In my eyes, that
puts us among the top I0 highest
teams,” Sanft said.

Sanft said that Shirk has looked
good in practice and should fare well
at the competitions this weekend.
She also said that Spector has had
good workouts inspite of a nasal
infection that kept her out of the
gym for two weeks.

“For Alisa to qualify as a fresh-
man is encouraging,” Sanft said.
“Qualifying for the national cham-
pionship is an honor. My hope is
that they will hit all four events, and
if that places them in the top eight,
great.”

Shirk said, “I’ve been having good
workoutssince reeionals.” But if the
truth were to be known, Shi_rk’s
workouts have been less than rosy.
A recurring leg injury that red-
shirted her last year has ﬂared up
again this year and kept her from
practicing the vault since the
regional competition, which was
nearly two weeks ago.

“It doesn‘t matter what it [my leg]
feels like; there’s one meet, and that’s
it.” Shirk said. .

Two years ago, Shirk brought the

national title on the uneven parallel
bars home to Pitt. When asked if she
was planning to repeat this feat, she
said, “I’d like to make bar finals and
see what happens.” i

To say that Shirk has been the
most noticed gymnast in Pitt’s meets
this year is an understatement. But
this weekend, when she goes up
against the best in the country, she
may just be a face in the crowd.
When. asked if this bothers her she
said, “I just feel no one’s going to
really notice me. l’ll just mingle in
with the Georgia team.”

Spector, who competed in
national gymnastics club competi-
tion in high school, said she is both
excited and nervous about the meet.
“Right now, I feel strong. The beam
has been going really good and
strong,” Spector said.

“l’ve never been to California._Jt’s

going to be fun just going," slfersaid.

“If I hit four out of four routines, the
scores will just . come.” Spector
started the year in a slump but came
out of it after setting her goals and
working towards them. She said she
has lived up to, her. expectaions and
is excited to‘ have qualified for
nationals.

“Lisa and I were ecstatic when we
got the news —-— we almost killed our-
selves jumping on the stairs.”
