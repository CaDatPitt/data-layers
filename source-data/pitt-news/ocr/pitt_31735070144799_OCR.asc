Pitt researchers have gotten closer to
 a cure for colon cancer
Robert Schoen, a Pitt professor of
medicine and epidemiology, and Oli-
vera Finn, a professorin Pitfs School of
Medicine, areleadinga team 
 a vaccine on humans that
prevent the pre-malignant polyps that
fonn in the colon and turn into cancer
Colon cancer, which results in more
than 650,000 deaths each year, ‘is the
second leading cause of cancer—related
deaths in the \Western world, according
to the Wodd Health Organization
The  of the vaccine follows
the old cliche of “nipping a problem in
the b ” i
The vaccine targets an abnormal
variant of a self—made cell protein called
MUC1. The  normally secretes
mucin in the  of the colon, protect-
ing cells from the harsh environment of
the ducts -
 the cell that produces the
MUC1 protein as a.  machine If

the cells that make MUCl. _

Oompa Loompas, James Bond take over stage

by Jen Hirsch
Staff W/rite/'

_Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House
played host to a different kind of
competition Friday night.

The rules were simple for
Greek Sing: an undergraduate stu-
dent would choreograph an eight-
minute act with one vocal per-
formance. But then the Oompa
Loompas took over.

Members of Pitt’s Greek com-
munity battled for singing su-
premacy at Greek Sing, an annual
competition and charity event that
pairs fraternities with sororities
for a singing, and dancing perfor—
mance. p

Delta Zeta sorority and Delta‘
Chi fraternity placed first for their
“\Xi/illy Wbnka”—therned perfor-

mance. They also took home best
costume and best scenery honors
for the Oornpa _ Loompa outfits
and chocolate factory set.

With a red light backdrop, re-
mixed “james Bond” theme songs
and seductive Waltzing, Delta Del-
ta Delta sorority and Kappa Sigma

' fraternity Won first runner—up and

best choreography for their 007-
themed performance. ’ ‘

The men of Kappa Sigma,
who placed ﬁrst last year, did not
let their female counterparts out-
shine them onstage.

“We’re dance—o1:iented,” said
junior Paul Park backstage. Af-
ter delivering a high—energy per-
formance, Park looked less like a
secret agent and more like a wax
ﬁgure at Madarn'Tussauds if‘ the“

Pitt's sororities and fraternities took their turns'performing in the Fitzgerald Fi

Greek Sing Pagé 6 to raise money for the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

Best Buddies embark on

8-hour scavenger hunt  

by Becky Reiser
i Stzyf Writer
‘ A group of college students and their buddies
spent Saturday proposing to strangers, 
human pyramids and singinginrestaurants.
They were competingin an annual giant scav-
enger hunt called ‘Wﬁdnight Madness” to raise
money for Best Buddies Pennsylvania, 21 non-
profit organization that’ tries to improve the lives
of people with intellectual disabilities.
Megan Carbaugh, the group’s program su-
pervisor, said the money raised from donations

. and pledges will help fund programs.

Carbaugh said there are 20 chapters in the

1 western part of the state, and she would like to
' expand the progratn.

Pitt’s student chapter works with Best Bud-
dies‘ College, the extension of the international
program. Best Buddies College  university
students with people —— their buddies —— who

. are 18 or older and have intellectual disabilities.

“It’s nice because most of the buddies are the
same age as their matches,” said Amanda Tizio,
president of Best Buddies at Pitt.

Tizio said there are currently 49 matches at
Pitt and 29 “associate members,” people who are

Many of the people who participate in Best

Buddies attend CITY Connections, a program
that helps to teach life skills, such as cooking or

.  a job, to high school graduates with dis-

abilities _

The group members participate in one event
per month with their buddies, but Midnight Mad?
ness is one of the biggest and most anticipated
events of the year. i, .

Deena Kim, Pitt’s executive director of Mid-

night Madness, explained that 20 colleges across"
‘ the country participate in a day-long scavenger

hunt to raise money for the Best Buddies ‘orga-

nization.

Pitt was one of_three schools picked. to host
a scavenger hunt.” Saint Francis University and
Penn State also hosted hunts

The scavenger huntparticipants compete not
only with teams.at Pitt, but also with ‘other col-
leges in the country 1

“The scavenger hunt is based on the city. It’s
speciﬁc to Pittsburgh,” said Kim, who helped
compose the list of assignments for the hunt.

The list looks more like a packet, with 11 sec-
iions of tasks to complete Groups must travel to

crowd applauded.

But some attendees gasped and mut—
tered, “Keep it PG,” at the ﬂuttering skirts
in the act. I .

Senior Caroline Sincavage, who choreo-
graphed the “Wizard of Oz” act by Chi
Omega sorority, said, she thought it was im-
portant to tell a story. '

Dorothy (played by Sincavage), the Tin

Man, Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion each led
solo performances after narration by Glinda
the Good Witch. Although Scarecrow lost
her prop and hat at one point, she delivered
an otherwise ﬂawless performance. 0

Together, the four then traveled to Oz by
tune of Unk’s “Walk It Out” and defeated
the Wicked Witch.

Chi Omega and Zeta Beta Tau fraternity
set the bar high for the night but went un-
noticed by the judges, leaving without even
an honorable mention.

Pete Hammerle, a senior Sigma Chi who

helped coordinate the event, had been at the
Field House since 5 a.m. He said this event
reminded him how much he loves Greek life.

The coordinator of fraternity and soror-

ity life,-Summer Rothrock, said events like

Greek Sing make her job enjoyable.

“Our~Greek students are some of the
top leaders on campus,” she said. “They’ve
worked night and day to raise money and
put on a good show tonight.”

sorority and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity of
the National Pan—Hellenic Council enter-

Event coordinators have yet to determine
the amount of money raised, but Hammerle
estimated before the show that Greek Sing
would bring in nearly $30,000 for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

If so, the Greek community would be on
track with its pledge to raise $500,000 in five
years for the University of Pittsburgh Can-
cer Institute, he said.

  school's indecent act

Six years ago, at the _age of

~13, Savana Redding was strip-

searched at her school in Arizo-
na. She was in eighth grade.

The assistant principal at
Redding’s school suspected her
of ‘having brought prescription-
strength ibuprofen pills to school,
the New York Times reported.

In response, iwo female school’
employees thoroughly searched"

Redding: She had to remove both

her bra and underwear. -
No pills were found, and Red-

ding, an honors student, was left

‘humiliated. Redding’s_ mother.

was disgusted by the school’s ac-
t:ion_and ﬁled a lawsuit. Redding’s
case -4- 'she’s now 19 — will be

heard before the Supreme Court '

this April.
This case will ask justices to

consider a difficult question: In V
‘ an attempt to keep schools drug-

_free, just how much freedom do
school ofﬁcials have in‘ policing
suspected students? The preva-
lence of drugs stored and traf-
ﬁcked through schools is an issue
that unquestionably warrants. our
attention. ‘ i

Yet Redding’s case exempli-

, ﬁes an inappropriate overstep of
:_authority that _tarnishes the repu-
:tation of our nation’s school sys-
¥ tem.

At any age, a strip-search by

school officials would be an un-
‘ comfortable occurrence. But for
_. a 13-year-old, they experience
. would be markedly more trauma-
, tizing than for an older student.
’ A younger student might not be

as able to fully grasp- the reason-

ing behind the school’s actions.
Arguments surfaced that the

school’s actions _ violated the

‘ Fourth Amendment, which pro-

hibits searches.

unreasonable

Even if the act is labeled uncon-
stitutional, the matter remains
that the school’s procedure was
overwhelmingly improper.

If Redding’s school Officials
intended to strip-search her, they
should have first sought the per-
missionof her parents. Schools
often seek parental permission
before releasing students on a

ﬁeld trip or even showing R—rat—;
ed movies. Disregarding parental l

consent in this situation is con-
tradictory to such a typically cir-
cumspect system.

There are other measures

to combat drug exchange and
storage that don’t blatantly in-A
vade students’ privacy. Random :
locker searches could_. be used:
frequently because lockers are,
after all, school property. Some 1
might regard students’ backpacks ;
and their very pockets as private f
property. But at least a search of 
these items doesn’t violate per- 1
sonal privacy to theextent of a I

full strip-search.

In addition to causing per-:

sonal trauma, such -searches

would damage a stude_nt’s rela—:
tionship with the school system. 

Any _ falsely. suspected student

subjected to a strip—search likely’:
would feel cheated and violatedi
by an institution that’s supposed -'
to maintain an environment con- i
V. ducive to learningand moral de- 

velopment.

Drug use is a real issue, but%
—~ as in Redding’s situation 
supposed prescription pills- just"
aren’t as dangerous as a student Q
concealing a ﬁrearm, for exam— f
ple. Her search marked an unfor— =
tunate example of school ofﬁ-:

To the Editor,

In Mason Herron’s March 25 article addressing the Employee Free Choice Act, he badly distorts what
the EF CA actually says. In doing so, he joins in’ the chorus of hysterical business interests lobbying against

anything that might facilitate workplace unionization.

First of all, the EFCA does not abolish the right to a secret ballot. It only removes the right of manag-
ers and bosses to demand one. Traditionally, anti—union employers insisted on secret—ballot union elections
not out of any concern" for democracy, but  order to prolong the unionization process. This allowed em-
ployers time to terrorize employees with firings and threats of company closure and mass unemployment.
Under the EFCA, the workers can still decide to form a union by secret ballot, but it is now their decision;
employers no longer.have the right to demand it. '

Another of Herron’s claiins, namely that “businesses have been equally guilty of violent coercion [as

iN.E.R.D. gets sad students dancing after Pitt loss

onstage to have their own rock star
moment, resulting, predictably, in said
guys jumping up and down, playing

‘air  and generally  they

were Pharrell W1Hian1s
But the self—love didn’t stop there

For a six—minute, slinky soul jam, the
N.E.RD. crew invited a veritable ﬂoor
of Holland Hall onstage for \X/illiamsg
to dance with and  to. The guy
and  stage overpopulation played
more like an episode of the surely in
the works MTV reality series “Who

Wants to Fellate Pharrell?” than a hip-

hop Show _
Thankfully, all was not lost
N.E.R.D. dove head first into the
thumping coke workout “Everybody
Nose” and the  funky
“She Wants to Move”. When the
band spliced in the  riff oﬂFranz'

'Ferdinand’s ‘Take Me Out,” the show

ﬁnally came ﬁlll circle, ending with the
infectious and intense energy it started
on

Pitt might not have won on Sat-

“ urday- night, but for the few hundred

students packed into the Fitzgerald
Field House, N.E.R.D.’s show of wild
and live hip—hop made the loss an
easier pill to swallow

Taza 21 brings great flavor

to Murray Avenue

fresh every day.

makes to order Two vertical rotisseries revolve
slowly with hunks of lamb and chicken, meats
identiﬁable even at 20iyards, unlike the conglom-
erate meats offered at chain  and schwarma
shops

Upon entering, three giant menu boards ar-

_rest the hungry customers attention. Offerings

ranging from meat and  sandwiches
($6—$7) to salads and soups ($2.50), yogurt drinks
($2.50), milk and honey fruit cocktails ($4.00),
desserts and Arabic coffee ($2.50) made it diffi-
cult to decide what; to order. But  another
look at the paper menus offered on the coun-
ter, I decided to ‘go with Taza 2l’s specialty, the
schwarma After all, I had to investigate whatwas
deemed a “schwarma experience’ ’ Why just have
a sandwich when an expexience beckons?

And because daily specials offer a good look

company it; ‘ 2 .

v  six days a week —— the cafe closes on
Mondays —_— Taza 21 was relatively quiet on a
Saturday afternoon. A couple, stillwearing their

coats despite the warmth of the restaurant, qui— _

etiy munched on tabouli salad and split a wrap.
The restaurant was not playing music and the flat
screen installed above the counter seemed a black
hole in the company of the  spirited pri-
mary colors that deﬁned walls and

Despite the lack of ambient sound, Taza 21
felt insulated ﬁom the street, even the noise of
the buses passing by failed to penetrate the lazy-
aftemoon atmosphere

While we waited, Abraham bustled about
the kitchen, carefully slicing bits of meat from
the rotisseiies,  the falafel and  the
cucumber sauce a bit of a stir before 
us our sandwiches Pressed, whole wheat wraps
contained _the smell of fresh parsley, tomato and

tahini sauce layered over the hot lamb and chick— .

en, a mouth-watering concoction ,
Though a bit the lamb had a deep, rich
ﬂavor that was offset by the light cucumber

ever uied —— a light crunch preceded a moist and
spicy cake of  accompanied by lettuce,

. tomatoes, chopped pickles and parsley
We lingered over lunch, almost unable to ﬁn—.

to the monstrous size of other sandwich estaly

etables,  for a lunch that kept me full until
well into theevening
It would be easy to ovedook the
 cafe if you were intent ‘upon reaching
 ‘ the Giant Eagie or the 61C Cafe for an
afternoon coffee But the bright yel-
lows and reds of the storefront make
Taza 21 a place that grows on the ha-
bitual stroller. ‘After 8 1 / 2 months of  Mur-
ray Avenue home, the foot traffic has increased.
“After a few passes, people come in to check

Pittsburgh photographers career seen through Silver Eye

Gruber, page l0

“Aaronel is a strong woman with an incredible
work ethic,” said Bloomﬁeld in an e—mail. “She is
feariess about photographing in unusual places,
like fenced—in dilapidated steel mills or underneath
bridges.”

Often, Gruber will focus on the lesser—photo-
graphed aspects of a scene, rather than the obvi-
ous, generically beautiful vistas

“All of her photographs are unexpected,” said
Shearing “There’s a very eariy color photograph
of a  in France  If she turned her camera
half an inch in any other direction, she would have
gotten one of the greatest views in Europe But

what she’s done is taken a photograph of a shack,-

which is a rather  formal arrangement”
Of particular interest to Gruber is the city
of Pittsburgh. Some of her most iconic photos
portray industrial desolation in gloomy shadescof
gray
“I think people see her photographs of the

ruins of the industry, [and] people are grabbed by A

those images in personal ways,” said Shearing

But Gruber isn’t "interested in  focusing
on Pittsburghs past industries In “The Analyti-
cal Eye,” visitors can see the old and the new of
Pittsburgh, its industrial past and is green time

(as seen in “Downtown Pittsburgh Skyscrapers
from Mount Washington”).

“Most people outside of Pitisburgh now
think of Pittsburgh as  a black and smoky
city, which is the very opposite [‘Downtown Pitts-
burgh  from Mount \X/ashington’] is

printed in silvers and light greens It comes out as i
kind of a rebuff to the perceived view,’ ’ said ‘Shear? A

All in all, one remains constant through-

out Grube-r’s different projects: her,  "

“I do believe that Aaronel has an eye that

principles, to the way  can literally work to-=
getherina framein aninteresting, formalwa,”
said Benedictjones. “She can analyze a scene and
translate that three—dimensional reality into a two
dimensional plane’ ’

Gruber’s workhas been on display many times
before — museums and corporations seem to
gobble it up —- but this is the first time visitors will
be able’ to experience the ﬁill breadth of her pho-
tography in one exhibit And the best  about
it?‘ It’s just a short bus ride away.

Pitt’s last two contests had gone, it
was just the type of game the Pan-j

guard, Levance Fields, was at the line
to shoot two free throws The mood

'throws,VVillanova would miss a last-

second prayer and the game would 1

 Hot Hand

by Emily Steiner
Staﬂ W/liter _

OKLAHOMA CITY — The
scene at the Ford Center in Okla-
homa City on Sunday night was
anything but favorable for a play-

’ er, coach or fan of the blue and

gold.

Between the roaring crowd
of 10,343, an overbearing sea of
red surrounding the 20-some Pitt
fans and the barely audible cries

of “Let’s Go Pitt,” it was beyond’

overwhelming to be a Panther.

. The Panthers, once behind by
as much as 27, found some late
offense, went on a 12-0 run in

the ﬁnal minutes, and didn’t allow 2

Oklahoma to score in the last six
minutes. But it was too late. The
Sooners advanced. to the Elite
Eight, beating Pitt 70-59.
Despite circumstances work-
ing against them, Pitt started hot.
It.took an early 2-0 lead and
even though Oklahoma had aria-

now and their careers. We just had an incred-
ible game and two very good teams playing their
hearts out and they left everything on the ﬂoor.

‘Young, Blair awarded ~

—Pitt senior forward Sam Young and Blair '
were named to the East Regional‘ all—tourna— .

ment team. ;

A —Young averaged 23.3 points per game in
his fourcontests, totaling 93 points in all. Blair
added 16.8 points and 13.8 rebounds per game,
both improvements on his season averages.

—Villanova players Dwayne Anderson and
Dante Cunningham were also named to the

team, while \X/ildcat Scottie Reynolds was cred— ‘
ited as the most outstanding player. Reynolds _
' tallied 12.5 points per game in the East Region, 3

but hit the huge shot to lift Villanova to the Final

Four.

. Something about the second half
—It was the second Villanova—Pitt matchup
this season in which Pitt was favored by more
than two points, and the second time the Pan-

- thers held a halftime lead before eventually fall-
-mg.

-Pitt led by five  the last contest and

eventually lost the game by 10, 67-57. The Pan— ' B

thers led by. two at the break on Saturday night
and were outscored by four in the second pe-
riod. R '

Other stats and trends

—The last time the Big East had two teams in
the Final Four was in 1987, when Syracuse’ and
Providence made the trip. Led by coach Bob
Knight, Indiana eventually _won the title.

_\Xf1th the loss, Pitt’s all—time NCAA Tourna— ,.

ment record dropped to 21 —22_.

Zellous scores I8 ‘points

in final game as Panther

i Women's basketball, page 15
Hand. “I think I had a good game tonight, . i

but shout out to everyone else. I’m_ really
glad I had a good game, but I’m so much
happier that we’re in the Elite Eight and
still alive.” _ .

' With the combined efforts of Zellous,
Taneisha Harrison and Xenia Stewart, Pitt
and Oklahoma found themselves tied once
again,_ this time at 16, before Oklahoma
started to run away. i '

The difference in‘ the matchup was of—
fense. Pitt’s shots just didn’t fall, and it
seemed like Oklahoma couldn’t miss. In
the first half, Pitt made only 31 percent of
its ﬁeld goals and only went 3—of—13 from
behind the arc.

Zellous halted an Oklahoma run, con-
verting on a long jumper, but Pitt couldn’t
get any intensity to match that of the
Sooners, no doubt encouraged by the over-
whelming home crowd. -

The teams went to halftime with a score
at 41-32 ‘in favor of Oklahoma.

The ball wasn’t sinking any easier for .

Pitt after a break. '

_Ok1ahoma’s Nyesha Stevenson- hit an
early 3—pointer, which Zellous followed up
with one of her own, her first from long
distance of the game.

Stevenson hit another 3—pointer just as
the shot clock ran out, and the Panthers’
offense came to a virtual halt from there.

“In our eyes it was a big play,” said Zel-
lous. “I think it was one second on the
clock andthat got the crowd into it. We
just had a defensive letdown. It was a big
play for them.” ' ~ ‘

With a score of 47-35, the Sooners went
on a’ 17-2 scoring rampage, and the game
was all but lost. . ‘

Zellous found some offense with 10
minutes in-the half, scoring two for the
team, and giving Pitt a boost in score, 64-39.

Although Elite Eight status was all but

she left the game with two minutes to go.
She scored 18 in her ﬁnal game for Pitt, 12

in the second half, and brought down nine I

rebounds in 35 minutes of play.
