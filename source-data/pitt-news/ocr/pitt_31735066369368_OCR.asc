Foerster, Wecht Win Democrat Nomination ForCounly Seals

. _ By ROD GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer ..

County commissioner candidates Thomas J. Foerster
and Cyril H. Wecht won_ the endorsement of the Allegheny
County Democratic Committee Saturday during a
convention marked bydissent at the Syria (Mosque in
Oakland. ' .

Incumbent Commissioner Foerster, with 1,252 votes,
and Coroner Wecht, with 1,092, led by a large margin the
other three commissioner candidates, Clerk of Courts
Wayne P. Kelly (with 685), Oakmont Democratic Chairman
Dorothy Duffy (with 332) and Harrison ‘Township
Commissioner Gracian Korpanty (with 23).

Sheriff Eugene L. Coon, another county commissioner
candidate who did not attend the convention, withdrew
from the endorsement race, protesting that the convention
was “rigged” to defeat anyone except Foerster and Wecht.

Coon, who lost the county Democratic committee
chairmanship to Wecht in 1977, also objected to the

decision by the committee to allow no speeches by the
candidates for county offices before the endorsement vote.
“I always allowed the candidates three to five minutes to
speak when I was chairman,” Coon said in a telephone
interview. “How can people get the feel for someone if
they haven't heard them speak?”. ’
Coon also said the use of uniformed guards at the
convention “smacked of intimidation and oppression.”
7 Both F oerster and Wecht said they had no opinion on the
vote against speechmaking; Both said they would have
been willing to speak if necessary.

“I was willing to go either way, ” Wecht said. “I wanted

that (the decision on speechmaking) decided by‘ the
committee people.” V .

Wecht also-defended the use of security guards at the
convention. He said that the guards were necessary to
avoid cheating, which, he contended, had occurred at the
convention in 1971 and 1975. ..

Other commissioner candidatesprotested the decision

not to allow speeches. Korpanty, a dark horse candidate... 
_ said that his constitutional right to free speech ljlad been’),
denied by the decision against speeches after he had _b18C!_l  j’
already notiﬁed by letter that he would be able to speak , 

three minutes. r
“This is one of the most unAmerican meetings I ever)

attended in my life,” Korpanty said. ‘ g l 2
Letters had been sent to the A candidates vying for

endorsement telling them they could have the chance to . i’

give a speech. However, Wecht said the ultimate decision
was left to the committee members. ‘

Kelly, who made the original motion that speeches be
allowed, said his reaction to the vote against speeches as
“violent. " , 1/

’ “There was no reason not to permit committeemen to‘,
hear the candidates,” Kelly said. "I was permitted to
speak four years ago when I ran for clerk". of courts and
because I was able to speak, I was endorsed.”

“Some house organ...would

The Student Government Board
last Friday cast its support for the
Alternative Curriculum program in
light of a 5-4 College of Arts and
Sciences Council vote earlier in the
week to continue but “review” the
troubled program.

In .a resolution issued by

president-elect Stan Galanski, the

SGB said it would back up the

Democrats Suppor

(Continued from page 1)

Although Foerster said the vote against speeches was
not political and that committee members heard candidates
at local- caucuses, other observers at the convention
disagreed.

Observers pointed out that no speeches favored Wecht
because candidates could not attack him on the so-called
“professional education fund” in the coroner’s office or
other issues. They also commented that caucuses were
held only sporadically and that many committee members
might not have heard the candidates speak.

In other endorsement'votes, Frank Lucchino won the

fiendorsement for county controller in a surprise victory over

incumbent John P. Lynch. Lucchinoreceived 871 votes,

while Lynch received 856 and William F. Wymard, 45.

Incumbent District Attorney Bob Colville won
endorsement with 1,311 votes over Frank A. McFerran Jr.
with 403 votes. '

. Deputy County Treasurer Jay Costa won the
endorsement for county treasurer over Jury Commissioner
Jean Milko and- William D. Presutti Jr. by a vote of
1,424-323-63. ‘ ‘

John P. Joyce won the endorsement for prothonotary
with 1,361 votes over Robert P. Ravenstahl, with 203, and

~ Jerry Morrone, with 170.

Mt. Lebanon attorney Michael Della Vecchia defeated
nine other candidates to win the endorsement for recorder
of deeds. Della Vecchia pulled 599 votes; George Braun,
412; Joseph Babish, 240; William Werley, 1,60; Bernard
Antol, 132; Richard Tenney, 90; J. Paul Farrell, 51; Patrick
K. Regan, 48; G. Pete Veltre, 21; and Joseph Mastriano,
11.

McKees Rocks‘ Mayor John Kyle Jr. won the

fendorsement for clerk of courts over Frank ‘Williams,
-maintenance director for the County Housing Authority, by
 three votes. '

Kyle garnered 331 votes; Williams, 328; John Ford, 326;

Committee members at the convention apparently voted
factional lines within the county

~..Democratic Party and were not affected by the reports
-':'about the “professional education funds” and two other

'0 privately controlled funds within the coroner’s office.

Robert Murphy of the 7th Ward, 16th District in

'3 Shadyside, said he never was a Wecht supporter and that

f "the new revelations about the coroner’s office only raised

_ more doubts about Wecht in his mind.

“There is no doubt that Wecht is a brilliant forensic

__.pathologist but that doesn't qualify him for what he is
_-lfdoing in the party,” Murphy said.

Commenting on the professional education fund,

 Murphy added: “Even if there is no question if the funds
;. were used correctly, why wasn’t it all above board and
Urevealed to the public? If past coroners had the same type
‘-of ‘fund, why didn’t Wecht be above them and reveal the

.._,existence of the funds?”

Lain Lee, secretary for Pittsburgh’s 13th Ward
Democratic Committee, said he felt Wecht and Foerster

3'were the best candidates for commissioner and thatvthe
hjprofessional fund was needed to help compensate the

coroner and his employees.
“I don’t think the county pays enough for men in

-.professional positions. It’s the same in Harrisburg.

Salaries are not enough for the caliber of men we want in
office. Wecht had to find some way to compensate his
professional help,” Lee said. '

Besides the question on speeches, county committee
members bickered over procedural questions about the
requirement of a majority vote for endorsements,
permission for candidates to send poll watchers to observe
the vote count and allowing state committee members from
the county to vote on endorsements.

Most of the committeemen at the convention, who
seemed to have decided who they supported and who were
eager to vote, supported allowing a plurality vote to decide
what candidates would win endorsement.

Various committeemembers who backed plurality said it
would take many run-off elections to decide what
candidate received endorsements. One committeeman
said there was no provision for dropping candidates from
the ballet in run-off elections and that this would lead to a
deadlock at the convention.

Sara Wymard, a committeeman from the Pittsburgh's
14th Ward, argued with acting chairman Frank Conﬂenti
about allowing representatives of each candidate to
observe the vote count. 5

Conflenti answered that the decision had been made at
party ofﬁces downtown because a professional voting
machine company had been chosen to handle the elections.

“Why does the hiring of that ﬁrm deny candidates what
has historically been their right?” Wymard asked.

Before Wymard finished her debate with the chair,
Wecht, the county committee chairman, was forced to
intercede and agreed that any candidate who wished could
send a poll watcher to the Mosque basement, where ballets
from 30 voting machines were being counted.

Faculty Assembly Votes To Support University Times

(Continued from page 1)

ther, if there were one, savings
would be minimal,” Engel said
in reference to Massey’s
statement that the Times’——if
discontinued——would be re-
placed by another newspaper.

Vice Chancellor of Public
Affairs Bernard Kobosky sta-
ted yesterday that the admini-

"stration did not plan to cease

publication of the Times.
“We have no plans to cut

The University Times’; at this
time,” Kobosky said. _ 

He added that while the
paper, along with several other
university publications, was

‘studied by the administration

for areas in which — savings
could be made, no final
decision about the future of the
Times or any other publication
would be made until after 1980

conducted in March.

“I’m concerned there’s an
awful lot of paranoia out there.
I think people are getting
awfully, awfully premature
about something that may not
happen,” Kobosky said.

Professor Robert Newman of
the speech department ex-
pressed concern at the assem-
bly meeting about the fzite of
the Times.

“For some of us it has been
the only avenue by which we
can seek to achieve change,”
Newman said.

In other business, Professor
Richard C. Tobias introduced
what he called a “lengthy
resolution” as an agent -for a
faculty member who is not a
member of the assembly.

The nine-point resolution,
which was tabled until copies of

it could be distributed to
assembly members for closer
review, included advocation of
examination of university ef-
forts to raise funds from
non-government sources and
from the Pennsylvania legisla-
ture, an examination of the

impact of increased 1978-79 ‘

tuition on all areas of the
university, and the effective-
ness of administrative units
within the university.

CMU Slates Criminal Justice Program

Carnegie-Mellon University has begun a new program
on Quantitative Methods in Criminal Justice.

The program is open to advanced students in the social
sciences and statistics. The research and training program
will help to develop criminology as an empirically-based
science by focusing on quantitive methods of researching
problems in crime and criminal justice.

“Criminology, as it now exists, is one of our most
primitive sciences," said Dr. Alfred Blumstein, Director of
the Urban Systems Institute. “Its development has been
severly hindered by an emotional, value-laden approach to
research. Most people form judgements based on their
experience with crime or the criminal justice system, rather
than on empirical evidence.”

*1

Blumstein said that a common belief is that people who
get arrested are a deviant group representing a small
segment of our population.

“This is not so,” he said. “Recent quantitative studies
show that as many as 60 percent of the males in the United
States will be arrested some time in their lives. This fact is
surprising to most people, and certainly changes their
perception of what an arrest record implies.” .

Blumstein said he believes that there are many policy
decisions for which quantitative analysis could be
particularly beneﬁcial. These include the severity of the
punishement imposed on a particular offender, the number
of prison cells built, and the types of programs available in
the prison.

The program is partially funded by a training grant from
the Center for Studies in Crime and Delinquency of the
National Institute of Mental Health.

Resident Life
Holds Festival
For Children

One hundred fifty to 200
institutionalized retarded‘ and
handicapped children will be the
focus of a festival sponsored by the
resident assistants and the Ofﬁce
of Resident Life to be held at Pitt on
Saturday, Mar. 31. The children,
ages 5-13, will ‘participate in the
ﬁrst “Hand in Hand Festival” in
the Pittsburgh area, which will be
held in the basement of the Forbes
Quadrangle from 12:00 to 5:00 p.m.

The idea of the festival originat-
ed at the St. Joseph’s College in
Philadelphia three years ago.
Harry Kuhn, one of the festival‘s
student volunteers, explained the
purpose of “Hand in Hand.”

“We want to introduce the Pitt
students to the institutionalized
retarded and handicapped of the
community while providing a day of
recreation for the children,” he

I

The festival headed by John
Fitzsimmons, a Pitt student, will
provide special performances by
magicians, mimes, live bands,
puppet shows, skits, cartoons, and
displays. The role of the Pitt
students will be to act as
one-on-one guides with each of the
children.

"The student volunteer will serve
as the child’s friend and guide
through the entertainments and
activities of the ﬁve hour pro-
gram," Kuhn explained.

Applications to work as a guide
for the festival can be picked up in
the Ofﬁce of Residence Life or
room 517 of the student Union.

Student orientation ses-
sions will be held one week before
the festival to inform all volunteers
of their responsibiliities and to
answer any questions that may

  The LCB
iAnd the Law

The recent re-emergence of Pennsylvania Liquor

Control Board agents following an exposé in a Pit-
burgh newspaper leads us back to the age-old issue of
the-w»drinking age in‘ Pennsylva_;nia,. and rnore
specifically, why this age has not - been lowered
despite active lobbying in Harrisburg.

The newspaper article, which dealt with the
carousing of college students in Oakland on Thur-
day nights, is said to be the cause of recent raids on
popular Oakland night spots, as well as the increased
carding of local tavern patrons. i

To deny that the majority of Oakland drinking
establishments serve patrons that are not 21 years old
(perhaps under false pretenses at times) or to deny

g drink

ll

that the majority of “underage” students attending
the University of Pittsburgh and other local colleges
is, in our minds, totally absurd. The incon-
sistent meanderings of the PLCB are, to be sure, an
embarrassment to the local enforcement agencies and
pub owners, as well as an inconvenience to local
college students, who will be frequenting these
establishments again in the near future.

What ' can be done?“ Complaining about the
coverage that the incident received in the local
newspaper is a thought, but the ultimate outcome of
that is at best, a reprimand for the reporter. Then it
is only amatter of time until another eager reporter.
ventures into the editor’s office with a. great idea for
a news‘ feature.

We could always ask the student body to go on a
general boycott of the local pubs as a protest, but
trying to keep a college student from hoisting a mug
or two of his favorite ale is tantamount to putting a
fish in water and asking it not to swim. Besides, any
boycott would certainly be good news for the PLCB,
who would more than likely take credit for the move.

The best answer seems to be lobbying, coupled
with the old practice of waiting for the PLCB\to go
away and then returning to your favorite watering
hole until the agents come back again. Each time
that the proposal is voted on in the state legislature,
the margin of defeat grows smaller. Ultimately, the

drinking age will be lowered.

Page 6—Monday, February 26, 1979

It is our belief that the average college stuglent, .

much like _the average adult, could maintain a mature
and discreet attitude towards drinking if the drinking
age was lowered, as it has occurred in various other
states across the nation. _ . ‘

.It should be obvious to those responsible-for the
denial of these rightsthat sporadic raids on bars will
not deter students from frequenting drinking
establishments again, regardless of the financial risk.
Constructive, organized attempts to rid the mature,
liquor drinking young adults of Pennsylvania of this
undue restriction is the only answer to the problem.

Fighting Over Game of Marbles

By RODGRIFFITI-I

The petty exchange between
Sara Wymard and Frank Conﬂenti
was typical of the atmosphere of
the Allegheny County Democratic
Committee on Saturday. Wymard
jumped into the fray after the
restless committee members had
waited anhour and 45 minutes for
the results in the endorsement
vote. .

“Why are there no poll watchers
allowed for the three hour count?”
she asked.

“An independent out-of-county
company was hired to run the
elections,” Conﬂenti replied.

“Why does the hiring of that firm
deny candidates what has histori-
cally been their right?” she then
asked. ,

This heated debate between the
two ended when Cyril Wecht,
chairman of the county committee,
took to the podium and embarras-
sed Wymard with a twist of his
rhetorical genius.

’ When Wymard challenged the
chair she was defending a historic
right at the convention, but her

action also shows the deep ‘

divisions within the county Demo-
There are

great ﬁssures that split Wecht and
Foerster from other leaders such as
Sheriff Eugene Coon and the
Flaherty brothers. '

After watching these factions
battle over allowing candidates to
speak and other minor procedural
questions, one wonders at the
pointlessness of the deliberations.
The committee is like a group of
children fighting over a game of
marbles.

For all their assumption of
importance within Allegheny
County, the committee and the
candidates they endorsed, if they
win office, can yield little power.
For years the county Democratic
Party has deterioriated to the point
that the committeemen fight for
little besides an ego boost at
election time.

County commissioners oversee
the county budget and the county
departments but this power means
little when compared to the
influence of state and federal
agencies. Since the presidential
administration of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, the federal government
has grown like an octopus, taking
over services once the exclusive
domain of local government.

The only group less powerful
than the county commissioners is
the row officers who oversee the

different administrative duties of
the county. Every year the row

officers receive the recognition‘

they deserve—next to none.
Although they control significant
patronage that they dole to the
party faithful with regularity, the
row officers only handle the tasks
of recordingvdeeds and wills that
have little lasting, impact on
people’s lives.

While these county posts slowly
have been stripped of their power,
the influence the party committee
had in elections has been diminish-
ed by the advent of electronic
media and the public relations
consultant in state and national
elections. As Pete Flaherty and
Richard Caliguiri have shown in
mayoral elections and as Milton

Shapp has shown in the guber- .

natorial elections, candidates do
not need hundreds of precinct
captains to win elections for them.

With the use of television and
radio, candidates can present
themselves to voters. With the
proper training and primping, the
candidate who uses TV well can
even defeat the old party regulars
who usually suffer from a rotund
bulge in the middle covered by a
baggy suit.

While the county party has been
diluted to little more than a select

WELCOME TO

' PENNSYLVANIA

club for politically inclined middle-

aged Democrats, the eager sup- ,.
plicants who regularly arrive at A"
every conventiofi never tire.

Wherever Wecht or Foerster was

on Saturday, dutiful committeemen

kowtowed to them, wringing their

hand in a damp handshake and

identifying themselves by name,

ward and district.

The only reason why these loyal
Democrats remain is the hope for
an easy job and perhaps the hope to
revel in the turmoil of local politics
that has replaced the wielding of
any significant power.

Although these souls may mean
for the return of the days of Davey
Lawrence when the party had some
power, they all know those are
gone for good. As one young

Democrat commented, “You know,
those days will never come back.”

Someday the party will either
pass into oblivion or change to once
again serve a major role in politics
beyond the local level. Until then,
the party and its convention does
little real harm. Those with ability
for better things no longer play the
games of party politics while the
old men who know nothing else
remain content if they can play
precinct captain.
. As for the rest of the public, the
arguments of Wymard and Con-
tlenti or Wecht and Coon offer a
diversion, and perhaps entertain-
ment. Most of the public find
nothing funnier than Cyril Wecht
turning red in the face for what is
really no reason at all.

Letters

H ippies, Beads and A C s

I am writing this letter to the
people responsible for drawing and
printing such a propagandistic
cartoon as the one displayed in the
Friday, Feb. 17
Alternative Curriculum program.
The _pictures displayed in the
cartoon, those of a hippie, a pair of
love beads, and a girl in a
mini-skirt, suggest that the news-.
paper views the students involved
in the program, as “leftwing

radicals” whoare clinging to lost

ideals.

For those who are more aware on
the news staff, a look at some old
Pitt News would clearly tell you
that any “political” ideals that
were held by the university as a
whole vanished long ago. Perhaps,
even the idea of the university as a
“whole," on airy issue, has
vanished. Therefore, it seems the
political overtones, seductiveiy

issue on the ’

suggested by the cartoon, were
misdirected.

The only lost idea we may hold
on to, and are being scrutinised for,
‘is the idea that we still have the
right to ask...why? To ask why our
educational system must be run the
way it is and why we cannot
question whether the system is
right for us, especially when we are
paying a high price for it.

So, until this school realizes
more of what our ideas and our
programs are all about (which the
university has hidden pretty well
through scanty advertisement) I
think it only fair that the newspaper
refrain from making any more
slanderous inferences.

Sussman —— A Lack of Disicernmentiin Word Choice

In your issuebf Feb. 12, you
published a letter by Professor
Maurice Sussman of the biological
sciences department which was
directed at remarks made by my
departmental colleague, Professor
Richard Cottam, during the course
of an interview with The Pitt News
on the subject of the Iranian
Revolution and, particularly, ele-
ments of its leadership.

I do not wish to contest in this
space the content of Sussman’s
letter, though there is much that is
contestable. Rather, my concern is
with Sussman’s lack of discern-
ment in his choice of words.
Toward the outset of his letter,
Sussman claims he does not want
to patronize ‘Cottam. Toward the

close of his letter, he fears, if
parenthetically, that indeed he has
patronized Cottam after all.
Sussman need not fear that he
has done so. What he does need to
be wary of is his misuse of
vocabulary. To patronize, accor-
ding to Webster’s Seventh Edition,
is “to adopt an air of condescension
toward" and to condescend means
“to assume an air of superiority.”
Unless Sussman has qualiﬁcations
that I have not heard of—-and his
letter gives me no reason to believe
that I have missed anything on this
score——the word that I believe he
meant to use was not patronize but
instead presumptuous. To be
presumptuous means “to overstep
due bounds,” and “to take

liberties.” It would, for example,
be presumptuous of me to lecture
Sussman on the intricacies of cell
structure, but I suspect that he
would hardly find it patronizing for
me to do so.

I do not know whether we shall

have further opportunities to hear
more political analyses and didactic
commentaries (complete with ad-
ditional bibliographic suggestions)
from Professor Sussman, but in
case we do, I trust that he will have

a proper need to apologize for his

patronizing attitudes rather than,
as was the case here. for his
presumptuousness.

After one listens to the album,

one can’t deny a distinct feeling of’

deja vu. The listener may begin
wondering if he doesn't already

The major contributing factor to
that sensation is Frederickson’s
vocals——they sound~ unmistakably
like Geddy Lee of Rush or Steve
Perry of Journey.

Most of the material on
“Trillion” sounds basically the

‘same. There are some real

standouts though in spite of all the

keyboards and trite, inane, lyrics.
Most notable are~“Child Upon

the Earth,” "Hand It to the

,Wind,” “Big Boy,” »“.May As Well

Go” and “Never Had It,So Good.”

It is rumored that Trillion’s next
release may be titled ‘‘Don’t Look

initely be a move in the right
direction.

gially good about it either. It’s all
very unimaginative rock ’n’ roll.
Side one of “‘Air Special” opens
with “Taste Of Your Love.” The
vocals sound so much like Alice
Cooper of old that it's frightening.
It’s followed by “Waitin’ For the
Weekend,” Bo Diddley’s “Who Do
You Love," “Tears Of a Fool” and
“Cooda Crawlin’,” featuring a
harmonica solo which conjures

images of the J. Geils Band.

The ﬁrst side closes with Benny
Goodman—Charlie Christian’s “Air
Mail Special.” This is the album’s
best tune for two reasons-—-there
are no vocals and it's only 23
seconds long. .

Side two opens with “Never‘Say
Die,” an original tune, not Black
Sabbath’s. The middle of the disc is
ﬁlled in by “Fever,” “Love

Stealer” and “Let It Roll.” All are
rockers, but not good ones.

The album concludes with
“Down the‘ Road Apiece,” a Will

“The Warriors” has attracted

its all about” outlook on life is excellent. Michael’s
character is complex: he is cool and confident confronting
his Viet Cong captors "or when stalking deer in the

.mountains but clumsy and unsure of himself and his

relationship with Linda (finely played by Meryl Streep).
“There’s times when only a doctor can understand you,”
says mill buddy Stan (John Cazale).
De Niro’s.best acting surfaces in one-to-one scenes with

Walken and Streep.

One flaw in the movie involves the time factor and the
war as an issue. It is not clear how long Michael, Nick and
Stevens are overseas, when they enlisted, if they
volunteered or if they were drafted. There are no
indications about their feelings toward the war before they
leave, only drunken boisterousness. (“I hope they send us
where the bullets fly.”) ‘ A

It seems Cimino and Washburn are not concerned about
i the war as apublic issue. The war slerves as an event

bringing about change in the lives of a few characters.
Whether that change is experienced on the streets of
Saigon or inside a steel mill in Clairton is unimportant.
What is important is the ability——or inability—-of each

‘person to handle such change.

“The Deer Hunter” received ‘nine Academy Award
nominations, including best picture. Also receiving

Connery ’s Performance Steals
‘The Great Train Robbery’

By PHIL CONTES
Pit} News Staff Writer

The year is 1855 and there is
25,000 pounds in gold sitting on as
British train. No one ever robbed a
moving train before, but for 25,000
pounds, Edward Pierce is willing to

belthe ﬁrst to try.

That’s the basic plot behind
Michael Crichton’s adventurous
and entertaining film, “The Great
Train Robbery.” Crichton’s screen-
play. adapted from his novel, is

. fast-paced and oftenamusing, and

L
x

his direction is masterful. He
develops many tension-building
scenes before the climactic rob-
ber'y, including an escape from
Newgate prison, a robbery (which
is really a ract against time), a
betrayal, and a chase through
London’s slums for revenge.

Sean Connery is excellent
throughout as Pierce, the master-
mind of the crime. He brings
together an assembly of crooks,
including Lesley-Anne Down and
Donald Sutherland as Agar. a.
bumbler with tremendous talent as
a pickpocket and lockbreaker. '

Connery brings his usual suave,
sophisticated touch to his charac-
terization, playing the part with.
just ‘a bit of self mockery. He is
delightfully amoral, not at all above
a brutal murder is necessary. This
contrast of his light-hearted witti-
ness. evident in an exchange of
double entendre’s with a very prim
and proper English genrlewoman
that exposes her fraud, and his

cold—blookcd brutality. brings a
needed complexity to Pierce’s
character.

Sutherland’s role is equally

enjoyable. He is involved in the

‘ crime not so much for the money,

but out of the desire to prove
himself a master safecracker, the
best in all of England. He is the
perfect

Brownsville
Album Back to

Basic Rock ’n ’Roll 9

(Continuedfr0m page 10)

all you Brownsville fans out there

(i.e. heathens), enjoy this new
album; it’s full of dull power
cording and simple lyrics that are
rarely intelligible—just the kind of
thing you’re probably looking for in
a bad rock ’n’ roll album.

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor

Curses! Foiled again.

A week ago, the Panthers were
plotting a Villanova Wildcat am-
bush that would enable Pitt to
capture first place in the Eastern
Eight basketball league standings.
But it was the Panthers who were
ambushed iii the Wildcats’ noisy
FieldVHouse and they came home
witha plan to secure second-place
by knocking off Rutgers.

Based on the assumption the
Scarlet Knights’ all-Americacenter
James Bailey would not play one of
his best games of the year, it would
have been possible for Pitt to beat
Rutgers impressively. For a while
Friday night it» appeared the
Panthers might get that win.

Then the 6-foot-8 Bailey literally
took control of the game at 2:23 in
the first half by slamming in an
alley-oop from teammate Tom
Brown and repeating the play less
than one minute later. This
showed that Rutgers was not going
to let itself be intimidated by Pitt’s
recent winning streak, the 5,102
unusually vocal fans or even the
roar of the Blues Brothers Band.

Pitt’s 76-68 loss to Rutgers could
best be summed up as follows:
Bailey was unstoppable, the
Panthers shooting in the second
half erratic and (pardon the sports
Pitt’s playing was not
intense.

“Tonight was the first night in a
month-and-a-half we played with-
out intensity,” said coach Tim
Grgurich. “Our inside game has to
be strong, the press has to be
working and this hurt us.”

Bailey’s outstanding perfor-
mance of 24 points and nine
rebounds was a little easier
because Sam Clancy was absent for
parts of the second half. The
6-foot-6 Panther mainstay was
charged with his fourth personal
foul at 14:57 and was forced to find
a place on the bench.

“Bailey just doesn’t miss," said
Pitt guard Carlton Neverson. “If
you let him get inside you’re
either going to foul him or he's
going to get two points.”

Rutgers spent a lot of time at the
free throw line, attempting 35 shots

but only making 20. Pitt was 10 for
16.

Twelve of Terry Knight’s game-
high 18 points were scored in the
second half and enabled Pitt to stay
in the game despite a Scarlet
Knight lead that twice ballooned to
11 points late in the contest.

There were moments of hope for
Pitt such as when the Panthers

Bonnie Tressler whirls through her uneven parallel bars routine ‘against

came within four points at 67-63.
Rutgers inbound pass sailed clear
to halfcourt where Knight fielded
it, only to find himself charged with
a controversial over-and-back vio-
lation. The visitors retained
possession of the ball and put the
game out of reach seconds later on
a three-point play by Rutgers’
Kelvin Troy. V‘ ,

During those final minutes, some
forced shots by Pitt and a number
of incredible near misses“ also kept
the Panthers from winning their
twelfth home game of the season.
“There were a few shots I thought
were going in for sure,” said guard
Dave Olinger. ‘‘It could have been
a lot closer.”

Pitt Gymnasts Win Weekend Pair

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Hoping to rise in the national
standings, Pitt’s women gymnasts
(6-3 and 17th-ranked nationally)
withstood a tiring road trip to
defeat East Stroudsburg, 133.4-

113.05, and Temple, 126.8-120.0,

Friday and Saturday.

“It was our best weekend of the
season,” said Pantherette coach
Donna DeMarino Sanft. “The East
Stroudsburg meet was especially
good. We had a number of
outstanding performances against
them. Everyone did well.

“Saturday’s meet was not as
good but I expected that because it
was our second meet in two days
and our girls were tired. It was a
long weekend and they were
anxious to finish the meet.”

Against East Stroudsburg, Pitt
took the ﬁrst three places in every
event except the balance beam and
vaulting. However, the Panther-
ettes were not as sharp against
Temple and they scored their
lowest point total of the season.

“I think we .could have done

,~\ ,-‘. In -. .» vi  . . ,-

without the Temple meet,” Sanft
said. “The judging was poor, our
girls were tired and we just didn't
do well.”

“It was a waste,” Sanft added.
“Even when you lose, you usually
learn something about yourself as a
team but against Temple we did
not gain insight into anything.”

Sanft said the judging was poor
in both‘ meets because the judges
who ordinarily would have worked
at them were officiating at the
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Ath-
letic Association and United
Gymnastics Federation Elite Divi-
sion Championships, that were also
held in eastern Pennsylvania this
weekend.

“We probably could have scored
135 points against East Strouds-
burg and at least 132 against
Temple if the judginghad been
good,” Sanft said.

Holly Martino was Pitt’s leading
scorer in both meets with scores of

-33.8 and 33.4 in the all-around
competition. Following Martino in

scoring were Roxann Evans and

Myra Bachuchin, who finished
second and third in the all-around
competition against East Strouds-
burg.

Pitt will meet defending national
champion Penn State this Saturday
in the Trees ‘Hall small gym. The
Pantherettes originally were
scheduled to meet F armingdale but
Farmingdale cancelled the meet.

Saturday’s meet will not affect
either Pitt’s or Penn State's
win-loss record because it is
rescheduled. However, individual
performances will be used to
determine Eastern and national
championship qualification.

“After this weekend, 1 think our
girls are looking forward to the
challenge of meeting Penn State,”
Sanft said.

The Pantherettes lost at Penn
State by 13 points early in January.

GYMNASTICS NOTES: The

starting time of Saturday’s doublet:

dual meet has been moved from 2
p.m. to 7 p.m. While the women
meet Penn State, Pitt’s men will

Four Panther wrestlers qualiﬁed
for the NCAA championships to be
held in Ames, Iowa, next week as
the Pitt wrestling team ﬁnished
fourth in the Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) Tournament last
weekend at the Field House.

Glenn Maxwell (118 pounds),
Jose Martinez (126) and Skip Bolin
(167) each placed in their respect-
ive wieght classes to qualify,
while Tom Jones (158) was selected

' ‘as one of four wild cards chosen by

the seven head coaches.

Maxwell was the 118-pound
champion, pinning Penn State’s
Jack Chidester at 3:13 in the ﬁrst
round, decisioning West Virginia’s
Mike Perry. 10-3, in the semi-ﬁnals
and super-decisioning. Cleveland
State’s Jamie Reid, 15-4, to win the
title.

“Glenn has been wrestling well
for us all year," Pitt head coach
Dave Adams said.

Martinez and Bolin ﬁnished
second in their weight classes.

Martinez crushed West Virginia’s
Dave Taylor, 12-4, in the opening
round, then upset top-seeded
defending champion Tom Diamond
of Clarion, 8-6, in the semi-ﬁnal
round. But Bloomsburg’s Don
Reese held him off, 5-4, in the
championship bout.

Bolin got a bye in the opening
round, then beat West Virginia’s
Joel Davia, 10-3, to qualify for the
NCAA’s. Bloomsburg’s defending
champion Dom DiGioacchino won
the title, however, with an 8-3
decision over Bolin.

Jones, one of four wild card
entrants Mar. 8 to 10 at the
NCAA’s, finished fourth in the
tournament at 158 pounds. He
decisioned Penn State’s John
Hanrahan, 7-4, in the opening
round before losing to top-seeded
Dale Gilbert of Clarion, .8-7, in the
semi-ﬁnals.

In the consolations, Jones pinned
Lock Haven’s Fred Montgomery at
6:04, but met Hanrahan for the
second time in the tournament and
lost, 3-1, in overtime. Still, he

“The coaches felt that 158 was
one of the toughest weight classes
in the tournament,” Adams ex-

plained. “So they gave wild cards'

to both Jones and Hanrahan. The
league has to choose guys who can
do the best job for the league
against quality competition, and
the coaches were very honest in
picking four wild cards who can do
that.”

   Pittsburgh Catching the  

By ANNA ARLOTTA ... .

Pitt News Staff Writer
The newest sport catching on

p in America today isii’t football or

basketball—it’s soccer. Soccer
teams are popping up all over the
country and just as fast as these
teams are being born Pitt is dishing

out players to compete for them.

Pittsburgh has followed suit and
found the soccer spirit—that is, the
Pittsburgh Spirit.

City soccer fans have the
opportunity to see two of their own
local products playing for the
Pittsburgh Spirit—Pitt alumni
Frank Bucci,—from Bethle Park, and
Joe Luxbacher, from Upper St.
Clair. .

The Major Indoor Soccer League
(MISL) drew ' both Buccia and
Luxbacher to the spirit after they
played outdoor professional soccer
following graduation from Pitt.

The Spirit is a very young team.
Luxbacher, at 28, is the team’s
oldest player.

“Indoor soccer is an exciting
sport-—people here ‘like it,” said
Luxbacher. “Sports fans are
coming to look at the league. The
league itself is successful. Even
though we (the Spirit) are not
winning, I’m still optimistic.”

Bucci, shares this optimism. “I
think if we can put» together a
couple of wins, we stand a chance

to get into the playoffs,” he said.
“And once you get there, anything
can happen.”

Some may question the Spirit's
future in Pittsburgh because of
their last-place standing in the
MISL. Bucci and Luxbacher are
not among those curious about the
Spirit's existence next year. “A
first-year team in any pro sport is
tough,” Luxbacher said. “We
have many young players on our
team, inexperienced players. I
think we can end up with a decent
season and the playoffs can find
anything happening.”

Bucci agreed. “I think we’ll still ,

be around next year,” he claimed.
“There’s going to be a lot of
changes in personnel soon and
there will be improvement. We’ll
still be here next year.” 7 ’

There have been disappoint-
ments to Bucci, however.

“So far " in Pittsburgh,
Americans aren't showing that we
can play, even though we have the
potential,” Bucci said. “The Spirit
is the future of soccer in Pittsburgh
and there are four of us from the
area——Dave Egan from Shadyside,
Art Rex from the North Hills, Joe
(Luxbacher) from Upper St. Clair
and me. My parents finally get to
see me play in the pros-—I like
that.” ’

Both western Pennsylvanian

we‘

 

natives, ‘Buccijandja Luxbacher

decided to ‘attend the University of
Pittsburgh, although'they didn’t
play together as Panthers. In his
three years at Pitt, Luxbacher set
two records--—most goals in one
game (7) and most goals in a career
(35). ‘

“When I was at Pitt (1972-74),
we had pretty good years,”
Luxbacher said. “I think there are
excellent players there now and
they're playing pretty good soccer
with a tough schedule.”

Bucci also holds a Pitt record
from his 1974-78 playing years-—-
most career shutouts (15). Last
season, Bucci helped coach the
goalies at Pitt, under head coach
Leo Bemis. _

Luxbacher, who has been con-
verted from an outdoor striker into
an indoor defender, came to the
Spirit with professional expgrience.

int’ of lndcorPror- Soccer

(a ~«now-defunct A North American"

Soccer League team).

“After leaving Pitt, I signed with
the Philadelphia Atoms,” said
Luxbacher. “I enjoyed playing
there, although I didn’t get all that
much playing time because many
of the players were foreign and got
the nod.”

From the Atoms, Luxbacher
went on to play with the newly
established Pittsburgh Miners of
the American Soccer League,

a team that folded after a year of ,

play.

Bucci gained his first profession-
al experience when he signed with
the Connecticut Yankees of the
ASL last April. In‘ one year with the

-Yankees, Bucci, ,_who has-"only.

played goalie for five years, was
named the ASL’s second choice for
1978 Rookie of the Year. He
missed by one vote.

“Although the Yankees ended
the season last in the league, it was

a great learning experience, for?‘

me,” Bucci said. ‘‘I was glad I
played on that team. We weren’t
very good so there was a good deal
of pressure on me as a goalie. It

gave me confidence that I could.

play in a league around such great
competition. I played against some
great, world-class players. ”

Both Bucci and Luxbacher hope
to’ stay in soccer’s professional
ranks and carry the Pitt name into
the sport.

“Pitt hasa good chance to catch
on to this soccer spirit next
season,’_’ said Bucci.
we’ve got Pittsburghers to look at
indoor soccer, they can ﬁnd quality
outdoor soccer-by watching Pitt.
I’m sure that many Pitt players will
join us in the professional ranks.”

Rutgers Buiies Pantherettes, 91-72

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staffwriter

Despite a 31-point record perfor-
mance by center Wanda Randolph,
the‘ Pitt women’s basketball team
fell to Rutgers, 91-72. Randolph, a
junior All-America candidate at
center scored only six of her 3]
record points in the first half, then

came on strong later to surpass
Edinboro’s Shiela Collins’ previous
Field House record of 30 points set
in 1975. A

Other than Randolph’s second

tough time taming the number two
ranked team in the East. Rutgers

showed the Pantherettes that they
were every bit capable of that
average and more.

“They had excellent shooting.
They’re not" just a one or two
individual team with a few people
that you can rely on,” coach Jean
Belthaser said. “The only thing
that you can do is play them
straight up.”

Balthaser’s words were sup-
ported by six Rutgers players
ending the game in double figures,
led by Kathy Glutz with 20.

The Pantherettes kept pace with

within six points in the first half.
Rutgers soon took command when

A they scored 15 unanswered points,

putting it ahead of Pitt, 36-17.
Many of ,_Pitt’s 21 turnovers
occurred at this point, causing the
Pantherettes to find themselves
down 38-17 at halftime.

After the intermission, Randolph
threw in ten straight points to bring
Pitt within 11. Following Ran-
dolph’s spree, however, Rutgers
ran off 11 points to put it up by 20.

‘ “We made some major mistakes
in the beginning,” said Balthaser.
“We were underestimating their
ability. They had a great team with
excellent shooters and we’ were

I having trouble generating offense.

We were getting one shot to every

‘ three or four of theirs, which hurt
‘r us badly.

“We were caught in a trans-
itional game in the first half and at
spots in the second half,” said
Balthaser. ‘-‘They started fast-
breaking on us and we had to fight
to get back, being down by 29.”

Balthaser credited Randolph’s
record-setting performance.

“Wanda just played great in the
second half, getting 25 of her
points in the second half alone."

Randolph added 17 rebounds to
her 31 .points, followed by
Stephanie Stripling with 10. .

   Season Ends With Losses, But Pantherettes Get Bid

. By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News StaI'fWriter

Pitt’s women's basketball team

had a goal all season long, one that
all sports.teams have in common.
That goal was to continue into
post-season play once the regular
season was over. The Pantherettes
have attained this goal and now
they have the chance for a
comeback in this second season.
They have received a bid to
participate in regional tournament
action starting next weekend.)

Competition for the Pantherettes
begins on Saturday as they face
‘number-one seeded Cheyney State
in an afternoon game at the
University of Delaware. Pitt has

been tabbed as the last seed of the
eight teams competing, which
forces the Pantherettes to come up
against some very tough compet-
ition early in the tournament.
Cheyney State is not an unknown
team to Pitt. The two met earlier in
the season with Pitt dropping a
12-point decision to Cheyney.

The Pantherettes will have five
days to prepare for Cheyney State;
to coach Jean Balthaser, that’s a
blessing.

“We're excited that we have
been given another chance to
compete,” said Balthaser. “And

Pitt's Kinney, Blackshear
Lead Tracksters in Michigan

By JOE BRANDT

Coming off a respectable show-
ing at Delaware last week, the Pitt
track squad turned in another ﬁne
performance last Friday at the
University of Michigan Wolverine
Relays in Ann Arbor. Michigan.

Running against some of the top
teams in the East and Midwest, a
number of Panthers stood out at
the meet. Pitt was led by its two
freshmen jumpers, Larry'Kinney
and Tim Blackshear. Kinney won
the triple jump with a leap of 49-9.
more than three feet further than
his nearest competitor.

“Larry has the ability to become
one of ‘the ﬁnest jumpers in the
history of this university,” said
Pitt's jumping coach Dan Good-
year, “and could clear 51' if
pushed -by .competiticr.. ’ ’

Blackshear placed 2nd in the log
jump, with a distance of 23-4.

“Both Larry and Tim are
dynamite athletes, with tremen-
dous natural ability, and should
contribute many points to this team
in the next three years,” said
Goodyear.

Some impressive performances

runners,.with Joel Albers placing
fourth in the 880 mile in a time of
l:54.4, and Bud Cooper taking

Cooper also participated in the

Gary Siriano was sixth.

The Panthers have one more
meet remaining on their indoor
schedule before they move from
the Field House to Pitt Stadium for
their outdoor season. They will
travel to Eastern Michigan on
March 3.

Although Pitt was originally
scheduled to compete at Middle
Tennessee on that date, head track
coach Mike Agostinella chose to
take his team to Eastern Michigan
instead. “The competition will be
stronger at Eastern Michigan,”
said Agostinella.

us. Because of the difﬁculty of our
schedule, these ﬁve days are a
luxury for us.”

Balthaser went on to explain’ that
competing against Cheyney State
could be an advantage for the
Pantherettes. *

“We are the underdog in this
tournament and playing the num-
ber-one seed the opening game
isn't an enviable position to be in,”
said Balthaser.” But Cheyney
plays a slower type of game, which
for us is an advantage because of
how thin we are running, especially
in our guard position. We’ve been
playing one tough game after

another and this break will give us.

another opportunity.” ‘
Tournament action begins on

Friday night at’ Delaware when
number-three seeded Penn State
takes on number six St. Josephs’ in
the ﬁrst game of a doubleheader.
Following will be number-four
Maryland against number ﬁve
Montclair State.

Saturday’s action will see num-
ber two Rutgers pitted against
number seven Edinboro and
Cheyney State against Pitt.

The tournament is run on a
single elimination basis.

Region 1B, in which Pitt is
competing, sends two teams from
their original eight to the national
tournament.‘

“Our region is predominantly

a the strongest in the country,” Bal-

thaser. “So strong that we are

allowed "to send our number one

and two teams into national
competition. ”
“I’m glad that we'll have

another ‘opportunity (to play),"
said captain Robin Fry. “As a
senior, I’m happy to get one more
chance this season and I’m excited
to be able to compete against some
tough teams before my basketball
career ends.

According to Fry, “Any given
team can win any given night. We
have a lot of work ahead of us but
we’re not out of their 4 range of
competition.

“We’ll give them a run for their
money. Besides, they have

everything to lose and we have
everything to gain.”

Rutgers’ Abdel Anderson can't stop Wayne Williams from scoring.
