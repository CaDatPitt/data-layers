The BAS built a second shanty on the Union lawn on Monday to illustrate their committment to Pitt's divestment.

 Moral protest or an eyesore?

Black Action Society erects second shanty  

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Slowly but surely, the anti-
apartheid movement at Pitt is shifting
into high gear. ‘Monday, the Black
Action Society constructed a second
shanty in front of the William Pitt
Union. -

0 After the revolution, See page 6

”The new shanty represents our
way of contributing to the divestment
cause.  Its purpose is to bring more
awareness to the students on campus.
We want to raise the concern of stu-
dents,” said BAS chairman Tony

Baldwin. .

Tendayi Mundawarara, of Students
for a Free South Africa which works
jointly with the BAS in maintaining
the shanties, contends that a second
structure was needed to maintain
momentum. '

”We have no interest in keeping
the status quo,” Mundawarara said.
”The new shanty symbolizes the fact

that our cause is a continually escalat- ~

ing one. It symbolizes the fact that
we're moving on.”

Both Baldwin and Mundawarara
suggestedthat further steps mightbe
taken if the new structure fails to
generate sufficient reaction.

”We realize the shanty won't be
the complete answer,” stated Bald-
win. ”We are considering more ex-
treme action.” _

Baldwin believes opposition to the
shantiescomes mainly from those
who oppose divestment.

”The people who dislike the shan-
ties are the ones who support Pitt's
keeping its investments in South Afri-
ca,” Baldwin stated.

Baldwin believes the board of;
trustees should follow the example

set recently by several major U.S. cor-
porations.

’’If people like IBM, Coca-Cola and

others are pulling out, so should Pitt,”
said Baldwin.

Baldwin disagrees ”wholehearted-
ly” with the administration's ap-
proach to the divestment question.

”These people [i.e., the university
administration and President Reagan]
are very conservative,” Baldwin said.
”They only care about money. They
don't seem to care about human
suffering. One must wonder if these
people really believe there's a God.”

Baldwin alleges that the fight for
divestment is just beginning.

‘Consciousness all over the world
is being raised,” said Baldwin.

Dr. Bernard Fisher, distin-
guished service professor in the
department. of surgery at the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine, is the recipient of the
most prestigious award given‘ by
the American Cancer Society, its
‘medal of honor. This award was
presented to him last nightduring
the society's annual dinner at the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New
York City. _

According to the American Can-
cer Society, Dr. Fisher was
honored for his ”persistent coura-

geous action which changed atti-
tudes so women could receive
less extensive treatment for early
breast cancer and for determining
the role adjuvant chemotherapy
plays in controlling metastases,
thereby saving more lives.”

Dr. Fisher, who has been chair-_
man of the National Surgical Ad-
juvant Breast and Bowel Project
since 1967, challenged conven-
tional concepts of breast cancer
surgery, which were based on the
belief that tumors spread in an
orderly fashion and that extensive

profreceives medal of honor

surgery in the cancerous area was
necessary to improve survival.

Through a series of national
clinic trials, Dr. Fisher led col-
leagues in centers throughout the
country in gathering scientific data
to validate the idea that radical
mastectomy, a mutilating surgical
procedure that was standard treat-
ment for nearly a century, was

_ often not necessary.

Indeed, the clinical trials proved
that segmental mastectomy —— a
breast-preserving surgical tech-

- appropriate and effective treat-

nique that removes the cancerous
lump and an adequate amount of
normal tissue — plus radiation is

ment for breast cancer patients
with tumors up to 1‘/2 inches in
diameter.

Dr; Fisher's investigations into
the nature of cancer are continu-
ing, but his scientifically based
revelations about breast cancer bi-
ology have already begun to bring
about dramatic changes in physi-
cians’ approaches to localizing
control of cancer.

Bell calls

for more
education
spending  

By Christopher Connell

AP Writer

A national commission headed by
former Secretary of Education Terrel
H. Bell said the United States is risk-

' ing ”national suicide” unless it sharp-
ly increases spending on its schools-

and colleges.

The academic and civic leaders, in
a report commissioned by a state col-
lege group, rebuked President Rea-
gan and others who have sought to
cut aid for college students.

The report, released Sunday, called
for a domestic Marshall Plan to nearly
double the number of college-

educated adults by the turn of the I

century.

”Public officials who propose
budget reductions in education at a
time when the republic is handi-
capped by the burden of an un-
dereducated populace are
unthinkingly abetting an act of na-
tional suicide," the Bell commission
said. ”Their priorities are wrong.”

The 56—page report, "To Secure the
Blessings of Liberty,” was prepared
for the American Association of State

Colleges and Universities, which is

holding its annual meeting in Phoe-

nix. Bell was addressing the group to-_

day on the recommendations.

The 22-member panel included Ar-
kansas Gov. Bill Clinton and former
Mississippi Gov. William Winter, as
well as a half-dozen college presi-
dents, the heads of both national
teacher unions and the chancellor of
New York City's schools.

The association represents 372
four-year campuses that enroll 2.5
million students and award _a third of
all bachelor's degrees.

It urged states to keep college tui-
tions as low as possible, in part to
help recruit more minority students
and stop the growth of ”an American
underclass.” It also urged the state
colleges to take the lead in produc-
ing the 1 million new teachers need-
ed by public schools in the next
decade, and to help cut the dropout
rate in half.

The commission criticized states
for curtailing spending on remedial
programs. It said remedial education
will be needed ”for the foreseeable
future” in the state colleges.

The report's pungent language
echoed the 1983 ”A Nation At Risk”
report by the National Commission
on Excellence in Education, which
Bell appointed.

That report warned of a ”rising tide
of mediocrity” in U.S. schools and
likened their condition to "a unilater-
al act of disarmament.” It spurred
many states to raise high school
graduation standards and boost
school budgets. -

Two French hostages freed in Lebanon

DAMASCUS, Syria — Two French
hostages freed from captivity in Leb-
anon were handed over to French
diplomats today at the Syrian Foreign
Ministry and then flew home to
France. '

Camille Sontag, 85, a retired auto
dealer kidnapped May 7, and Marcel
Coudari, a 54-year-old businessman
seized in February, looked well but
bewildered after their ordeal.

The pair, who arrived in Damascus
from Beirut during the night, were
driven from the Foreign Ministry to
the French Embassy, where they
boarded a jet and flew home.

Both men wore suits, ties and clean
shirts and sat for an hour in a minis-
try anteroom before they were for-
mally handed over by Foreign Min
ister Farouk al-Sharaa to their coun-
trymen, who flew in earlier aboard
the jet.

The white-haired Sontag, sporting
an unkempt beard, sat nervously,
quietly wringing his hands as he and
Coudari were served Arabic coffee in
small blue cups.

Coudari chain-smoked American
cigarettes and talked with Syrian
officials.

The appearance of the two in
Damascus followed reports that the
organization holding them in Leba-

non planned their imminent release.

The three French government en-
voys arrived earlier today aboard a
special aircraft and headed to the
French Embassy. Then, together with
Ambassador Alain Grenier, they went
to the Foreign Ministry and met with
Sharaa.

The envoys were identified as Fran-
cois Bujon de L’Estang, Premier
Jacques Chirac’s diplomatic adviser,
Eric Desmaret, chief of staff to For-
eign Ministerlean-Bernard Raimond
and Michel Roussin, of Chirac’s
office.

In Lebanon on Monday, anony-
mous callers claiming to speak for the
Revolutionary Justice Organization
telephoned Beirut newspapers As-
Safir and An-Nahar, saying the
Frenchmen had been freed in M05-
lem west Beirut’s Ramlet al—Baida
residential district.

With the release of the two, six
Frenchmen remain missing in
Lebanon. I

Reagan says ‘no’
to any Iran deals

WASHINGTON — President Rea-

ASSOCIATED PRESS

reported arms-for-hostages swaps, Ln-
sists that no U.S. laws have been vio-
lated and that the U.S. policy against
deals with terrorists remains intact.

The president, according to his
spokesman Larry Speakes, also asked
his advisers on Monday to keep si-
lent about the matter because
”hostage lives are at stake.”

Speakes, in a statement issued late
Monday, said Reagan huddled with
his top aides in an Oval Office meet-
ing earlier in the day.

The meeting came after congres-
sional leaders said they would inves-
tigate whether the National Security
Council skirted the law in circum-
venting Congress, the State Depart-
ment and the Pentagon in reportedly
arranging arms sales to Iran in ex-
change for U.S. hostages.

Reports surfaced last week that
such arms shipments might have
been involved in the release of three
U.S. hostages, including David Jacob-
sen on Nov. 2.

The Washington Post, quoting
unidentified sources, said in today's

editions that National Security Ad-
vise_rJohn Poindexter told key mem-
bers of Congress that the White
House made ”a miscalculation on
who it could trust in Iran” when it
secretly established contacts there.

Byrd to lead Senate

WASHINGTON — Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston announced Tuesday that he.
has abandoned his challenge to Sen.
Robert C. Byrd for the job of majori-
ty leader in the 100th Congress, leav-
ing Byrd unopposed for the post.

’’I do not believe I have the votes,”
Johnston told reporters. Byrd has led
the Democrats in the Senate for near-
ly a decade.

Johnston added that Byrd had
projected ”an aura of electability”
that slowed any momentum he might
have had among incoming Demo-
cratic senators.

The South African Press Associa-
tion reported 19 injured, quoting an
unidentified spokeswoman for the
provincial hospital in Newcastle.

”Nobody died,” said Police Col.
F.M. Venter. ”According to my
knowledge there were three police-
men and three women [injured].”

He also said that one officer was
seriously hurt.

Venter said the three policemer“»

and at least one woman were hurt in
the explosion outside the magistrate's
court in Newcastle. The other two
people were injured at the earlier ex-
plosion at the shopping arcade.
SAPA quoted the hospital spokes-
woman as saying that all the injured

at the hospital were black, and that —

seven were in serious condition, and
two were in critical condition.

A local newspaper reporter, who
was prevented by police from seeing
any injured people or damage at the
courthouse, said the first explosion
took place in a shopping arcade :1‘
about 2:30 p.m. between a sporting
goods store and a shop selling news-
papers and stationery. The second
blast occurred a half-hour later at the
courthouse and ”was the larger ex-
plosion," said the reporter, who re-
fused to be identified by name.

Thinking about what is learned through death

Suicide is a-most difficult thing
for those who are left behind.

All that is left for us to do is
wonder why and perhaps think of
what we could have done to stop
it. After thinking of it over and
over again, we are left with the
same conclusion: Why?

It is something we can never
know, and this makes the thought
of it even more difficult than the
death alone.

Dr. Paul Biloen, a researcher
and professor of chemical and
petroleum engineering, died a vic-
tim of suicide on Oct. 28, 1986.
He was 47.

”He was a very well known and
respected researcher of interna-
tional reputation,” said James
Goodwin, a colleague of Biloen's.

”He was considered one of the
sharpest minds in the field._’’

Biloen was involved in two

I research projects. One funded by

the Gas Research Institute, the
other by the National Science
Foundation.

Police offer safety program
for student apartments

By Craig Pearson

Staff Writer

City and campus police will be
presenting personal safety pro-
grams because of the recent out-
break of burglaries and thefts in
the Oakland area.

On Thursday, Nov. 13 at 7
p.m., sergeants C. Grier and D.
Pizoli of the University of Pitts-
burgh Police will present a pro-

. garding personal safety, you can

Chiang said Biloen had among the
biggest research projects in chemi-
cal and petroleum engineering at
Pitt.

Knowing all this makes his sui-
cide a difficult thing to
-understand.

A story about the death was
printed in The Pitt News the Fri-
day after it occurred. The headline
for the story said, ”Pitt chemistry
prof jumps off bridge.”

Within the story, several mis-
takes were made. Names were
misspelled. Details of what Biloen
did as a researcher were printed
incorrectly.

A few letters, phone calls and
comments to those who work for
the paper showed us quickly how
serious the mistakes were.

Most place the blame on the
writer. Some said he didn't put
enough thought into the story.
Others criticized his credibility as
a writer.

The disappointing thing is that
he was not responsible for the
headline, and the.errors contained

within the story were such that
editors who read the story should
have caught them.

Matt Thornton understood the
importance of the story and the
.decency of the man. Somewhere
between writing and printing, that
understanding was lost. It was not
only lost by the writer but also by
those who edited what he wrote.

I have always felt criticism of -a
newspaper by its readers is the
most important of functions. We

need a check-and—balance system ”

to ensure that the quality of the
paper is at an acceptable level. -

When that level drops, the read-
er is thereto let us know.

The bad part of this criticism is
our inability to correct what errors
were made. We can be made

an

aware, embarrassed and shunned
by our readers, but the mistakes
cannot be erased.
What we can hope is that,

through criticism, we learn how to
avoid the same mistake.

One letter said, ”The Pitt News
should provide more responsible
journalism.”

I hope the writer will see im-
provement at some later date, and
understand his criticism and anger
with the treatment of this story did
accomplish something.

As we serve the readership of
the university community, we
constantly learn what is inade-
quate about that service and try to
improve it.

Dr. Paul Biloen meant more to
the people around him than he
could see.

It is sad when the bad in our
lives is seen as somehow more
important than the good. But it
happens

It is even sadder when the im-

  3

portance of the loss of life is for-
gotten because of a headline that
never should have been printed.

Judging from the response of
those who saw the paper and
knew the man, Biloen deserved
much better than what he
received from us.

I know the headline we wrote
has been forgotten by many, For
those who do remember, there is

probably anger associated with the )

it.

The research he began goes on,
the students he taught will con-
tinue to learn. We will continue
writing headlines. There is much
to look at in this case, and good
reason to pause for a moment and
remember him. At this point that
is all we can do.

The man's life had an effect on
those who knew him. His death‘
had a smaller effect on those who
didn't.

We are learning.

May he rest in peace.

Common sense
is the best cure

Last Friday, Nov. 7, Pittsburgh Police Chief William Moore met
with Gary Moses, the head of Pitt's Public Safety Department. They
originally planned to discuss the rash of crime in South Oakland, but
that led to a discussion about the safety (or lack thereof) of students
living in off-campus apartments.

They didn't come up with any earth-shattering conclusions on how
to combat crime in Oakland, but they did suggest some sensible meas-
ures to control it. - ‘

So far this term, the crime rate in Oakland seems to have increased
dramatically. At the same time, police protection has increased ac-
cordingly. Even though there are more officers on~duty in our neigh-
borhood, that hasn’t stemmed the amount of assaults and robberies.

Moore and Moses alluded to the idea that the police have done
pretty much all that they can do at this point, and the rest is up to us.

Being up to us doesn't mean calling in the Guardian Angels or start-
ing some other vigilante group. It doesn't mean keeping a .38 in your
backpack. And it doesn't mean we have to sit back and be potential
victims for the rest of our years at Pitt.

What it does mean, however, is that students have to begin using
some common sense when they are walkingaround after dark and_
when they have safely arrived at their apartments. Simple things such
as locking doors, walking in groups and keeping your eyes open can
do a lot to reduce the amount of crimes committed in Oakland. Make
sure that your doors and windows are locked at all times. If you sus-
pect anything is wrong, you've been robbed, or there is someone
trying to break in, call the police immediately.

It's apparent that the police have done all that they are going to
do. The rest is all up to us.

Free radio access
isn't a good idea

Remember the summit held by Reagan and Gorbachev last month?

. It wasn't too hard to forget. The two men met, things looked good

for some sortof mutual agreement, then they reached a stalemate,
and both men went home empty-handed. All of the reports from
Iceland since then have said that there was no real progress made
in regard to superpower relations. .

This week's U.S. News and World Report carried a story about one
deal struck at the summit.that may just come to fruition.

The United States has a radio station called the Voice of America
that broadcasts in Russian 215 hours of programming into the Soviet
Union every week. At the same time, the Soviet Union has one called
Radio Moscow that beams 224 hours of programs in English to North
America. Radio Moscow is on a shortwave band, and few Ameri-
‘cans own shortwave radios, so not too many people here listen to
it. The Voice of America has a much larger audience in the Soviet
Union but only when Soviet citizens can get it. The Soviet govern-
ment spends an estimated $1 billion a year jamming the broadcasts
of. the Voice of America.

So, at the most recent summit, Gorbachev offered to stop jamming’

our broadcasts to his country if we givehim better access to ours.
Namely, the Soviets want to lease time on an AM frequency so that
they can reach more of us. ’

It is a shame that the two most powerful men in the world can only
agree on something as trivial as this. And they haven't even officially
agreed on it yet. It's so ridiculous that it's almost comic. Radio
Moscow is a tool of Soviet propaganda. At the same time, The Voice
of America is a tool for U.S. propaganda. It's a pretty sad commen-
tary on both of our countries when the guarantee to freely distribute
misinformation comes before the guarantee that there will be a world
left in which to distribute this misinformation.

At the rate things are going, the world may never see an end to'

the arms race and the senseless rivalry between the Soviet Unionand
the United States. At least now American and Soviet citizens will be
able to hear a_ declarationof war - live. I

The evil of two lessers

Finally, an election that appealed
to the most basic problems of our so-
ciety instead of those boring, old is-
sues. Of course, we're speaking of
the Pennsylvania gubernatorialrace
— a breath of something less than
fresh air for the people of this great
state.

We, as democratic members of the
government of the people, by the
people and for the people, were
asked to judge the relative merits of
the preferred candidates. And a fine
batch we had this time around.

In one corner, weighing the useful-
ness of drug experimentation, tran-
scendental meditation and a
daughter's birthday, we had the es-
teemed William Scranton. Personal-
ly, he was my pick for the office. His
anguished screams were the quietest
and were at least silenced before the
polling got started.

In the other corner, from the state
of confusion, with a long history of
absenteeism, able to throw mud for
miles’ with a single television com-
mercial, we had Bob Casey. We have
to admire a man that sticks to his
guns, and I almost mean that literally.

MATTHEW
THORNTON

Please.

It seemed things got a little out of
hand there toward the beginning and
only got worse.

The candidate escalated the defa- ’

mation race to discreditable propor-
tions. By the time Scranton told his
loving public he'd had enough, we
were all too numb to react or even
to care. Too little, much too late.

Enough sarcasm. I guess that we
witnessed a change in the way our
politicians campaign. Since a cam-
paign ideally should ‘tell the voter
everything he needs to know to
choose responsibly, we can assume

’ that the new governor will manage

his office the same way he managed
his campaign.

A bit of extrapolation.

For fun, let's assume that a new

‘highway is going to be built and that

part of a residential area will have to

be moved to make room. Furthe
let's assume that Casey wants the‘
highway to be built.

With Casey's methods for getting
elected in mind, think about the way
he'd attack the problem.

As soon as the debate opened, the
media would be full of advertise-
ments abouthow often the people
used their homes. Would Casey as-
sert that since the. homes were only
inhabited for a couple of months out
of the year, the residents reallyx
weren't suited to have them? 7

Then,_1he residents might retaliate
by saying that since Casey didn't
spend much time on the existing
road, he really didn't have any need
for it.

Casey, in turn, tells the people of
the state that at one point in his past,
one of the residents used drugs while
meditating. What's more important,
he might ask, a hippie or a road?

I imagine we can all see where this
is going, so I'll quit. I can only hope
that Bob Casey decides to run his

new office with more reservation andﬁ

sophistication than he showed before ‘
the polls.

Whites are too sensitive

I want to know what is going on
when a college newspaper devotes
front-page coverage toward running
the picture of an alleged rape suspect
on your Nov. 5 issue. I'm beginning
to feel that all of this fervor over black
attacks on whites is a sick case of
overkill. Why are you whites having
so much trouble? My God, in practi-
cally every issue of The Pitt News,
you poor, delicate, sensitive whites
are either being attacked, robbed,
raped, punched or something. My
Dad and Mom used to tell me when
I was growingup, when people con-
tinuously have trouble, maybe you
should stop and take a look at your-
selves. After all, there are black wom-

en on campus and other young black‘
' men, and we can seem to maneuver

without yelling [about] any physical
abusive treatment. I am a black
Carlow College student, and I'm a
firm believer that ifl mind my busi-
ness, people will mind their business,
and so far I've had little or no trou-
ble. Now something is radically
wrong when people are constantly
complaining.

There is enough room in Oakland,
and in this world for that matter, for

_blacks and whites. And to those

whites_who are having difficulty,

' might I offer a suggestion? Just find

somewhere else to go. And while I'm

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November T2, I986 S

.-Home movies take on a newdimension

Q. My husband has been faithful
to me for seven years of marriage and
he does a wonderful job on my feel-
ings about myself—’always building
me up, telling me I'm gorgeous, dy-
namite, sexy. He even takes videos
of me in the nude, making me feel
so desirable. Because of the videos,
my friend says my husband is sexu-
ally abnormal. My husband claims

~"-“*"he’s OK. What's your verdict?

A. Your friend, as you term her, is
wrong and your husband is right.
He's perfectly OK. He's better than
.OK; he's terrific! If he makes you feel
that good, and you have him all to
yourself, that's living. Never mind
what your friend says, she's only
jealous. Who takes videos of her?

It might come as a surprise to your
friend to know how many sedate
couples have taken pictures of each
other in the costume of Eden. It often
startles. I don't mean. those terrible
young people — most parents of mat-
-ed children have got used to finding,
in a stack of prints, the ones the hap-
py couple forgot to remove. Or did
they forget? That's the question par-
ents have in mind sometimes, as they

hand the stack of pictures back with
a compliment, taking no special no-

tice — why start a fight? .-

What I mean is when the young
person finds a nude young woman
among parental photos, wonders
who it is, then, by chilling degrees,
she realizes it's Mother! She chal-
lenges her father about this evidence
of past degeneracy, and all he says
is that the picture cheers him up, re-
minds him of old times, when all the
world was green. .

Sometimes I ask a man to have a
picture in his mind of his wife at an
earlier time, when she was so allur-
ing to him, when she filled him with
sexual desire. That can help to restore
a starved marital sex life. It's a useful
erotic image, and one the man has
no moral objection to, seeing no
adultery in desiring a memory of his
own wife.

Restoring his own strong sexual
feelings from an early, though up-
right, age can. really do the trick.
Something similar happens when
Dad finds that old photo of Mom —
at the bottom of a drawer, hidden
from outsiders.

Performers get a

Patte Wheat-Lieber is new to the
, Midwest, and she hadlheard about an

Worganization whose work intrigued

her. So she decided to check it out.

The organization is called Arts Un-
limited. Its mission is simple. Arts Un-
limited sends performers to places
where people cannot get out to see
entertainment — places like hospi-
tals, nursing homes and residential
centers for the disabled. Arts Unlimit-
ed has 24 different acts that it sends
to these places.

On paper it sounded good. Patte

_ Wheat-Lieber wanted to seefor

I

—'herself._ .
‘‘I went to a nursing home in Nor-
ridge, Ill.,” she said. “I got there at

I p.m. and was let into the main din-
ing room where the performance was
to be. There were bright paintings on
the wall and little baskets of artificial
flowers on tables.”

The residents of the nursing home

had not entered the room yet. Wheat- .

Lieber was experiencing mixed feel-
ings. Her father had died recently and
had spent his last year in a nursing
home that wasn't nearly as nice as

.,__. this one.

“My feelings,” she said, "were
what I suppose are the usual feelings

that people‘ have when they visit a
convalescent home: the feeling that
I never want to be like this, that I
won't be like this — the prayer to let
me go quickly before it gets to this.
It has something to do with the sl ‘It-
tered illusion that we look at, the
depleted, worn-out spacesuits that
are, after all, simply lent to us to make
our way about the planet. And even

more distressing — the faces with the

lights out in the windows, the eyes
dead, some not even turned inward
to dream.” '

It was time for the show to begin.
Wheelchairs were pushed into the
room and lined up in rows. Some of
the residents were staring vacantly;

WESTI-IEIMER

That's how she used to look with
all her clothes off! He has forgotten
how she looked, and this reminds
him. And in his mind the wife who
has grown older with him isclothed
in that youthful nudity all over again.
She can't buy clothes like that at the
mall for restoring Dad's interest.

I think having pictures like that, in
hidden albums in the mind or even

in bottom dresser drawers, serves a
wonderful purpose in married life. It
is not good just for parents but also
for that busybody daughter who finds
it by mistake.

Sometime, in some way, it is good
to realize that a parent has a sexual
nature. That can help a young person
to understand her own nature, and in
time her child's nature.

We sex advisers often say that fan-
tasy is wonderful, but that acting out
fantasy can be dangerous. But’ being
in erotic home videos is acting out
that porn-queen fantasy harmlessly.

I am of two minds about your talk-
ing about your private videotaping
sessions with your friend. What you
do in private with your husband
should perhaps be more private. On
the other hand, by exchanging sexu-
al experiences confidentially, friends
spread much helpful and life-en-
hancing information.

Perhaps the right thing is to be pret-
ty close-mouthed about these private
activities, all permissible between
consenting adults, and certainly be-
tween married adults who are mar-
ried to each other. If you do tell a

little of that life to a friend, make it
a close and trustworthy friend who
will not say hostile hurtful things to
you about cherished private things,
or carry misunderstanding tales
around town.

Q. I'm 18 years old —- what they
call _I8 going on 30. My love is a
wonderful man of 54. We have very
good sex most of the time, but he
doesn't have great confidence that he
can satisfy me. I have told him he
does, especially when he doesn't
think about it. He tries not to think

about it, but he is so wrapped in anxi- '

ety at times‘ that he can't get erect.
What do you suggest?

A. You are probably right that anxi-
ety plays a part in his problem. It is

also wise to know that a man his age ‘

can use physical stimulation to be-
come erect. If this is understood and
accepted he can probably have a
good sex life, giving you great pleas-
ure as well as himself, for many years.
I do think your lover should see a
urologist — not with the idea that
there may be something wrong", but
to have sound information and reas-
surance.

some were simply talking among '’

themselves like any expectant au-
dience; some were asleep.

Into the room came a singing act
called Yvonne and Larry. They have

performed at Midwestern clubs and

restaurants for years; in real life they
are Mr. and Mrs.’ Lawrence Lindsey.

Wheat-Lieber said:

«“Yvonne began with a vigorous
song at the piano, and then Larry sang
‘New York, New York’ with Yvonne
accompanying. There was polite ap-
plause, but many of the nursing

Disarmament will

There persists in the American
mentality the ridiculous notion that
nuclear disarmament would benefit
the United States.

Those who expose such a view-

?-‘lpoint failto grasp the extent to which

their nation has come to rely on its
nuclear arsenal as a strategic deter-
rent. Gorbachev has said repeatedly
that his ultimate goal is the elimina-
tion of all nuclear weapons.

Indeed, one can hardly doubt his
sincerity.

Few today would question Soviet
conventional superiority, especially

» in Europe. If nuclear weapons were

i of German occupation. How soon.‘

to vanish tomorrow, the Soviets

.would have it in their power to

sweep to the English Channel in a
matter of weeks.

Surprisingly, though, the European
left fails to understand this. I find few
events more shocking as the recent
anti-nuclear demonstrations in Bonn,
West Germany. For some reason, the
West Germans refuse to believe they
would be the first victims of a Rus-
sian blitzkrieg. Like so many others,
they have been spoiled by the peace
and prosperity the U.S. nuclear um-
brella has brought about. .

And what about the French? How
soon they have forgotten the horrors

. ’_

 

they have forgotten those infamous
news reels which show thousands of
humiliated, teary—eyed Parisians
watching helplessly as wave after
wave of Nazi troops descended the

Champs-Elysees. Before their next ’

anti-nuclear rally, the French so-
cialists should ask themselves ifthey
would like to suffer a similar fate at
the hands of the Soviets.

Perhaps, however, one could argue
that the Soviets would not choose to
expand if given the opportunity.

Let us assume, as do so many liber-
als, that the Soviets are not the evil-
minded imperialists the Reagan Ad-
ministration believes them to be ——
that the Soviet Union, even in the ab-
sence of an American nuclear deter-
rent, would not embark on a policy
of aggression. Such a scenario would
leave the United States and the allies
two choices.

NATO could either remain depen-
dent on Soviet benevolence or under-
take a massive conventional build-
up. Dismal as it may seem, the Unit-
ed States would be compelled to opt
for the latter alternative.

Intentions are ever—changing; they
are no more stable than the motiva-
tions from which they. are derived.
Soviet ‘desires for peaceful co-
existence might vanish with the next

home residents just sat. Then Larry
sang ‘I Left My Heart in San Francis-
co.’ A woman in the front row sud-
denly began singing along. Another
woman made no movement at all,
but her face changed; her eyes be-
came dreamy, and she seemed to be
back in another place, another time.

“Larry launched into ‘Chicago,’
‘and the woman who had been sing-

’ ing along began clapping her hands

reorganization of the Kremlin.

Few Americans today realize what
a trying experience conventional re-
arming would be. Production of con-
sumer luxuries would undoubtedly
be curtailed. Conscription would
once again become an everyday real-
ity. Students would do well to
remember this before protesting for
a nuclear-free world.

All of this is concerned only with
U.S. strategic position versus the
Soviets.

What about the Chinese? Fighting
an ever-modernizing giant whose
population exceeds a billion would
be like trying to stop an avalanche;
the People's Republic ‘of China
would swallow Southeast Asia and
with it, billions of American trade
dollars in days.

_ To this point, we haveonly exam-
ined the potential consequences of
nuclear disarmament; we have not
yet considered the feasibility of such
of_an endeavor.

For obvious reasons, the United

 

‘Are’ you ready to sing?’ and _there
were enthusiastic responses. Yvonne
called out the words to ‘Let Me Call
You Sweetheart,’ and by now most
of the people in the room were
singing. n

"One elderly man was coaxed by
his friends and the staff to get up and
sing. He was rolled up front in his
wheelchair, and Yvonne accompa-
nied him as he sang ‘Oh, Marie’ and
‘Pennies From Heaven.’ He had a
good, strong voice, and I looked
around the room and saw an alive-
ness in the faces I hadn't seen before.

“Yvonne and Larry moved on to
‘Me and My Shadow’ and ‘Bye, Bye
Blackbird.’ Both Yvonne and Larry
were obviously having a wonderful
time, and the warmth.of the party
filled the room with energy. It had be-
come a real exchange — they were

putting it out and getting it back."

When Larry began singing ‘Please

Release Me,’ a woman who had been ’

clapping in time to the songs sudden-
Iy raised her hands for Larry to help
her out of her wheelchair. He drew
her to her feet, and they danced. Her
legs were weak, and she had to main-
tain a wide stance to keep her

States and the Soviet Union cannot
agree to disarm unilaterally. Com-

Chinese, Indian, Israeli, British and
French cooperation as _well. But even

cured, could the United States ever

that matter, ever trust us?

balance, but her friends were cheer-

ing her on.”

Larry went on to sing "Unforgetta-
b|e,” and a man from the nursing
home asked Patte Wheat-Lieber to
dance. She was surprised; the request
startled her out of her observer role,
and she moved onto the dance floor
with the man, self-conscious at first,
but soon happy to be there.

Yvonne and Larry finished with
“When You're Smiling.” The pro-
gram had lasted 40 minutes.

“Yvonne and Larry moved toward
the door,” Wheat-Lieber said. “They
were surrounded by chattering old-
sters. There were those who couldn't
move or speak, but their eyes had
changed — some sparkled; faces that
had been closed were open. In some
cases the expressions were simply
softened; people's guards had been
let down. Bodies that couldn't stand
sat up straighter in the chairs as they
were wheeled out.”

Patte Wheat-Lieber left the nursing
home. She thought about all the big-
name performers who play before

tens of thousands of people in huge.

stadiums. On this day, Yvonne and
Larry had performed for 75 people.
But what a difference they had made.

the U.S.

would dominate world politics.

All of this is not to suggest the Unit-
ed States should never consider
reducing current stockpiles of nuclear
warheads if the Soviets agree to do
the same. However, we must never
contemplate complete nuclear dis-
armament, with or without a strateg-
ic defense initiative.

To do so would imperil the free-
dom so many have fought and died
for.

After the Revolution 

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Sooner or later, the repressed peo-
ple of South Africa will be free. When
they are, the need for a stable, fair
government will be overpowering.

United States Congressman
Howard Woalpe (Mich.), chairman of
the Congressional ‘Committee on
Africa, will be the keynote speaker at
the opening of a symposium entitled
”Post-Apartheid South Africa.”

The symposium, sponsored by the
black studies department, will focus
on the economic, political and social
considerations necessary for the
transfer of power after apartheid has
been dismantled.

’’It is an attempt to seriously exam-
ine what kind of new society is be-
ing sought,” said Dennis Brutus,
South African political exile and

chairman of the black studies
department.

The speakers at the symposium will
represent political interests in South
Africa as well as university professors
studying the problem.

”Everyone fights for the revolu-
tion,” observed Andy Arnowitz, a
member of the planning group for the
symposium, adding, ”when the revo-
lution is won, no one has spent any
time thinking about what will happen
afterwards.”

in the past, turnouts for South Afri-
can rallies have not been as highas
expected, but Jules Lobel said he
feels confident that there will be near-
ly 300 people in attendance.

In a letter to the planning commit-
tee for the symposium, Mayor
Richard Caliguiri discussed his feel-
ings about the issue of divestment.

”The Botha ‘administration must

understand‘ that divestment and the
end of apartheid are not just trendy
issues on American college cam-
puses; they must understand that
their treatment of the citizens is
repugnant to all who value, freedom
and life,” the letter admonished.

The opening address will be at
7:30 Friday evening in Benedum Hall
Auditorium, followed on Saturday by
a series of workshops and lectures
discussing the constitution_a|, eco-
nomic, social and political issues in
South Africa that relate to the end of
apartheid.

”We certainly hold the view that
looking into post—apartheid South
Africa is no longer an unthinkable act
or a mere intellectual exercise,” Bru-
tus said. ’’[It is] an absolute necessi-
ty made inescapable" by the sweeping
logic of revolt within and without
South Africa.”

The contest is run at Pitt by the
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh and
at Penn State by the American Red
Cross of the Johnstown region.

According to Marge Brown of the
Central Blood Bank, Pitt had a
168-pint lead over Penn State on
Monday afternoon.

‘The figures then were 2,508 total
pints of blood donated by Pitt sup-
porters to Penn State's 2,340.

On Tuesday, Central Blood Bank
reported that the new totals were
2,911 pints from Pitt supporters and
2,904 pints from Penn State.

Marge Brown predicted the possi-
bility of Pitt losing its lead Monday
when she said that Pitt was only
slightly ahead. ~

”Penn State doesn't like to lose,”

.she said. ”They’|l start going through

the dorms, frats and everywhere else
to find donors.”

One thing Pitt students can do to
keep the lead is to get friends and
relatives to donate blood.

”We let everyone vote at all our
area donation centers, and what stu-
dents can do is get all their friends
and families to donate and put in a
vote for Pitt,” she said. "

Due to the fact that there is a mini-_
mum of 60 days required between

the times someone is allowed to give ‘

blood, most of the campus Creeks
will not be donating in the challenge.

The Greeks have their own annu-
al blood drive during the upcoming
Greek Week.

According to Ken Kumer of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, the Greeks
have been doing their part in this
challenge by recruiting donors and
informing others about the drive.

”A lot of people are donating for
the first time because of the
challenge,” Brown said.

The winning school will receive a
plaque at the annual Pitt—Penn State
game.

Last year, Pitt lost the challenge and
had to present the plaque to Penn
State at home.

This year, Pitt plays Penn State at
State College. ”lt’s now Pitt's turn,”

I said Brown. _
”Let’s go get the plaque back at

Penn State and bring it home where

An angel with rotors rescues the severely injured

By Michelle Zollner

‘ Staff Writer

The Center for Emergency Medi-
cine’s helicopter, Angel 1, looks like

. any ordinary helicopter. However,

medical equipment to treat victims of
trauma is available on board, as well
as an experienced medical team and
pilot.

According to Valerie Schreiber, an
aeromedical specialist, only a select
group of accident victims are trans-
ported on this helicopter.

The person has to be severely in-

jured internally. Potential candidates
include a pedestrian hit at over 30
mph, a person who has fallen over
20 feet or the victim of an automo-
bile accident who has been trapped
for over 20 minutes, Schreiber said.

”Using the helicopter is too expen-
sive if there are only minor injuries
involved,” said Schreiber.

Once the patient has become a
candidate for helicopter transport, the
weather becomes a vital factor in
deciding if the transport is to take
place. ,

The dispatcher first contacts the pi-

lot for clearance for Angel 1 to take
off. According to Herb Schutt, the
helicopter is kept on the ground in
cases of fog or haze. If the weather
is even marginal, the helicopter may
not fly.

”No heroes here,” Schutt said. ’’If
an unsafe situation arises, [the pilot]
can set down in a field.”

The helicopter needs a square area
of 60 feet to land. If this situation
doesn't present itself, the patient is
either transported by ground or kept
at the hospital until weather permits.

Schutt said he had one transport
during which the weather was so bad
that the helicopter was forced to land
in a field, and the patient was brought
to the helicopter by land transport.

Once the patient is stabilized at the

‘ accident scene or the hospital, the pa-

tient is transported. If the patient is
conscious, he is asked if he's ever
flown before. ‘

The patient is medicated if he has‘
not flown or has had trouble with fly-

ing in the past, according to Vince
Verdile, an emergency medicine phy-
sician affiliated with the residency
program at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The professionals have an interest-

ing job. Every day is unpredictable,

”Angel 1 averages three tlights a
day,” said Schutt. This past Saturday,
there were six flights.

Last Sunday, the helicopter had a
public relations showing at Mercy
Hospital's new Emergi—care Unit in
Monroeville.

The Center for Emergency Medi-
cine has an aeromedical associates

program which provides paramedics

with clinical training, lectures and
flight time so that when they are
available, they can ride on a
transport.

At the new Mercy opening, the pi-
lot, nurse and physician taught the
public as well as their peers about the
capabilities of the chopper.

The helicopter itself is German-
made and can travel at speeds of 150
mph, according to Schutt. The trip to
Monroeville took the helicopter three
minutes. The helicopter can transport

two patients at a time. It can travel I_

round trip up to 300 miles without
refueling. ~
Schreiber said that, compared to
other helicopters, this one has few
constraints and is the largest helicop-
ter presently monitored and trans-

ported.

Presently there is a landing pad at
Mercy where the helicopter is sta-
tioned. According to Verdile, sites
other than Mercy were considered.
This site was settled on so that the
helicopter could ”take off over the
river and avoid disturbing residential
areas,” said Verdile. For patient con-
venience, new landing pads are be-
ing opened. One is at St. Francis’ and
will be completed by‘ January.
Another has been built at Children's
but has not been officially dedicated.

The service provided by the Center
for Emergency Medicine and a con-
sortium of other hospitals ”supplies
help and serves as a conduit to bring
patients from outlying areas into the
city system,” said Verdile.

Lightning

Sprinter McRae, world-class all the way

By Greg Sysyn

Staff Writer

Six seconds. Just stop for a minute
and think about what someone can
do in six seconds. A brisk jog across
a clear Fifth Avenue takes about six

V seconds. Pitt track star Lee McRae, in

six seconds, can run 55 meters (about
60 yards). That is why McRae holds
the world's record .in the 55—meter
and is dubbed ”The Fastest Man in
the World.”

At this moment, McRae is one of
the premier athletes in the world. He
spent this past summer in the Soviet
Union competing in Ted Turner's
much ballyhooed fiasco: The Good-
will Games. A far cry from his
hometown of Pembroke, NC., a
rural town between Fayetteville and
the South Carolina border. The ex-
perience at theggames proved to be
interesting.

”It [Goodwill Games] was a big
thing for me,” said McRae. ”It was
my first time outside the United
States, and it was really interesting to
see how other people live.”

At the Goodwill Games, McRae
competed in two events: the
I00-meter dash and the men's
400—meter relay. In the 100-meter
dash McRae finished fourth.

“The meet wasn't how the televi-
sion presented it,” said_McRae. ”The
food was bad and the facilities were
poor. As a consequence, I didn't per-
form as well as I would have liked to.
I was disappointed.”

In the men's 400—meter relay, the
U.S. team took the gold and record-
ed the third fastest time ever in'that
event, but McRae felt that the squad
could have run faster.

”I gave it my all, and I feel that the
other guys did, except for one,” said
McRae. ”Namely, Carl Lewis. I feel
that he didn't run up to his potential
— that he was holding back and_that

 
 

 Br_own. is thHeg:l.'Panth‘ersi’ ‘unsung hero in the ‘backfield.

he was the reason that we didn't get
the world's record.”

This was not a personal attack on
Carl Lewis, though. McRae still feels
that Lewis is an admirable person.

”Carl Lewis is a real nice person
within the track circuit.  As a per-
son all around he is really nice — that
is, if you get to know the real Carl
Lewis and not the media's Carl
Lewis.”

Looking back to the world record,
McRae now feels mixed surprise. ”I
am surprised with all the success that
I have had. But at the same time, I
feel that last year I had just begun to
come into my own.” ,

Panther track coach John Vasvary
expressed similar feelings on
McRae’s record—shattering perform-
ance at the NCAA Track and Field
Championships in Oklahoma City.

”When we recruited Lee, we felt

' that he had the potential,” said Vas-

vary. ”Once he got here, we could
see that it was just a matter of refin-
ing his skills. The raw speed was
there; he just needed to get stronger
and acquire some confidence.

’’In the beginning he was beating
a, lot of people on inborn talent alone,
but the refining improved him great-
ly. He had run well earlier, and he

showed ‘the capability to break the

record. That day everything was put
together, and he hit a good race.
Everyone wasn't surprised, but they
were excited.”

With all this success, one would -

think that someone would tend to
rest on his laurels for some time, but
that is not the case with McRae, who
started training for the indoor season
back on Sept. 5.

”Now I am hitting the weights
harder this year than in the past," said
McRae. ’’In the past, I had not real-
ized the importance of weightlifting
in track; but now I am taking lifting
weights more seriously, and I feel that

outstanding performer at t

NCAA championships, and he is hopingfor similar success this year.

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

If you ask anyone on the defensive
squad of our football team for one of
the best pieces of advice they could
give you, one of the things they
would probably tell you before any-
thing else is never get in the way of

_ Tom Brown.

Brown, a 6-1, 225-pound senior
fullback from Lower Burrell, Pa., is
considered by many one of the best
blocking backs on the Panther squad,
and, ifjudged by records alone, this
would be a hard point to dispute.

This season, in nine games, he has
accumulated 310 net yards in rush-
ing and made I touchdown in 65 at-
tempts for a 4.8 average. In pass
receiving, he has made 19 recepti_ons
for 132 yards and a solid 7.0 average.
In the Miami game last week, he was
second only to Craig Heyward in
rushing yardage.

In the past three years, Brown has

proven himself a very durable play-
er with the ability not only to block
well but also to run and catch well.
His first game was in 1984 against
-Oklahoma, and he scored his first
college touchdown against Rutgers
last season. Also last year, he led the
way for Charles Gladman’s 1,085
yards. '

     

 

 

_ Running back coach Tommie Lig-

gins has a lot of praise for Brown. He

said, ”Tom Brown is the ideal full-

back. He is strong, quick, and [he] is
a threat to break a big run at any time.
Tommy is the type of kid you really
enjoy coaching because he seldom
makes a mistake." '

Brown said he felt this past week's
game against Miami was one of the
best days of his college career.
Although the Panthers lost, Brown
has nothing but strong affection for
his teammates.

”I think offensively we played very
respectably,” said Brown. "Also, our
whole team played a very respecta-
ble game. Our runners really can
hold their own, no matter what team
we're playing. This includes Miami.
Look at what Ironhead did; anyone
who can gain all that yardage against
the No. 1 team in the country certain-
ly is one great player, and that is go-
ing on the full belief that Miami was
playing the best they could.”

Brown feels many mistakes which
occurred during Saturday's game and
which were the main cause for the
Panthers’ loss occurred primarily be-
cause of the keen eyes of the Miami
defense, but he also feels one specific
problem stands out.

”The quarterback situation was
probably our biggest problem in the
game. It certainly was the question‘
all last week as to who would be it.”

_ As a freshman, Brown was able .to_-

W‘

 

  Panther fullback Tom Brown is ’keeping the faith’

ell,‘

see a Fiesta Bowl team. He also wit- '

nessed the depressed seasons under
Foge Fazio. He considers this year's

team a transitory one under new_

coach Mike Gottfried.
”We have a very good team this

year, no matter what the statistics‘-

say,” Brown said. "we have set our
foundations on Coach Gottfried, and
he has done the same thing with us.
It is not going to be long before'Pitt
is once again one of the most respect-

ed teams in the country. Gottfried is

going to make his team grow and
win.

_”Mike Gottfried is real|y“a great
person. He says what he means and
is very sincere. He wants everyone
to give it their all and do well. He lets
us know what direction to go.‘ And
above all, he wants us to win, and he
does his damnedest to see that it hap-
pens. If anyone can do it, he surely
can.”

In his last season here at Pitt, Tom

Brown can reflect back upon both
good memories and bad. He prefers.

to remember the good and gives
strong" and sincere advice to next
year's returning players.

”What I can say to the team is just ._ I

keep the faith and never let your con-

fidence go. Stick with Coach Gott-. 
fried and listen to what he has to say. '

This way, plus a little hard work,

 

,there’s no way you can do.badly."  

 

I

 

l ‘S ‘l I know what you're thinking.

You're thinking there is no reason

 _. in the world for you to go to the Pitt-
: 7 Rutgers game this Saturday. You're
I ‘ thinking itwill be cold, possibly rain-

ing or snowing, and you are not ex-
; actly going to see a battle for the
‘national championship. That is all

” 2 true, but there are still several com-

pelling reasons for you to go to the
game. As a public service to the read-
ers of this fine journal, I shall tell you
what those reasons are.

First of all, this game will be very
interesting because of the developing
of Sal Genilla as a player. This week
will be a much better indicator of
what Sal has in store for us next year
than the Miami game was or the
Penn State game will be. To expect

to perform well against the great

*"v—defenses those teams have is to ex-

' pect the impossible. But against Rut-
' gers, a team that is not nearly as good
as its 5-3-1 record, Genilla should be
able to experiment a little and find

a quarterback learning a new offense. I

i

out what part of the offense he is
comfortable with and what part he
needs to work with.

It will also be your last chance —-
unless you plan to drive to Penn State
—— to see future NFL players like Ran-
dy Dixon, Tony Woods and Steve
Apke while they are still in college.
That may not seem like much, but I
think it's neat to be able to say that
I saw Dan Marino, Jimbo Covert and
Hugh Green before they became NFL
stars. Look at it this way, all your
friends at California University of
Pennsylvania, Edinboro and Clarion
will never see a future pro football
player in college. Unless they come
to Pitt Stadium. This will also mark

John Congemi’s last day on the Pitt -

Stadium turf. It will be a day most
likely filled with bittersweet
memories for Congemi, who can
only wish his two greatest moments
,— the 1984 Fiesta Bowl and the 1984
Penn State game — had been at the
stadium. Congemi ends what has
been one of the gutsiest careers I

Perhaps the most compelling rea-
son for going to the game is that, if
you are graduating, this week will be
your last chance to ever see the Pan-
thers while you are student here. You
can never sit in the student section
again and feel a part of it. It is true
that you can come back in future
years to homecoming games and
Penn State games, but then you'll be
in the adult sections and it won't be

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November I2, 1986

Panther fans shouldn't give up the ship

nearly as much fun as it now. Even
if you do sneak back into the student
section it won't be the same. This is
your final chance to savor the at-
mosphere of the student section be-
fore it passes into memory.

But that is not all. No, there are
other reasons to go to the game.

One reason to go is to find a Rut-
gers fan and ask him just what exact-
ly a Scarlet Knight is, and if it differs
significantly from knights of other
colors. There could be a problem,
however, in actually locating a Rut-
gers fan. At last count there were 37
in America and 43 worldwide (not in-
cluding Eastern Bloc nations). At Rut-
gers, nobody ever goes to the football

games. That's the reason — well -

that's one of a dozen reasons — peo-
ple make fun of Rutgers. If we don't
go to the game this week, people will

make fun of us, especially Penn State
people.

The crowd will be packed with
fabulous babes for all the dudes to
meet and full of fine young men for
young ladies to make acquaintance
with. Pitt Stadium is a great pick-up
spot

This will be your last chance to see
Pitt win until next September.

And finally, it will be a good way
to show Mike Gottfried and the Pitt
players you appreciate all they have
done this season. The team is 4-4-1
right now, but I honestly believe that
if Mike Gottfried had begun coach-
ing Pitt two years ago, this team
would not only have destroyed Mia-
mi but also be in serious contention
for the national championship.

So go to the game. You'll have a
good time  I promise.

Pitt sophomore running back
Craig ”Ironhead" Heyward has
been named Sports Illustrated
Player-of-the-Week for his perfor-
mance in Saturday's 37-10 loss to
the Miami Hurricanes.

Heyward, who rushed for 254
yards on 39 carries against Mia-
mi, broke Tony Dorsett’s single
game Pitt record of 38 carries in,
a game. Also, his 254 yards rush-
ing was the fourth best single
game total in Panther history.

The 6-0, 260-pound Heyward
was nothing short of sensational
in the Miami game, consistently
running through much smaller
defensive backs.

Usually the defense gives out
the majority of punishment in a
football game but don't tell Hey-
ward that.

”The way I look at it, they [the

Heyward is Player-of-the-Week

defense] are out to hurt me,” said
"Heyward. ’’I like to give a hit to
someone and then receive one.”

The one man who was at the
end of a lot of Heyward’s punish-
ing runs was Miami defensive
back Benny Blades.

”The first time I ran over Ben-
ny he said to me, ’a|right you got
me this time,’ but then when I ran
over him again he was upset,”
commented Heyward.

Despite Pitt's disappointing
4-4-1 record to date, the season
has been a good one for Hey-
ward, who sat out last year be-
cause of disciplinary problems.

Going into fall camp many peo-
ple questioned his ability to run
the football effectively, because of
his weight ”problem.”

But his statistics through the
Panthers’ first nine games of the
year have answered those critics.

Heyward has carried the ball
113 times for 643 yards and six
touchdowns, while catching 17

passes for 253 yards and one
touchdown.

With the difficulties Heyward
has been through at Pitt he is more
than pleased that people are be-
ginning to talk about him in a
positive way. ~

”With the struggles I had been
going through my freshman and
sophomore years, it was nice to
have people look up toward me
for something good instead of
something negative which they
usually do,” said Heyward.

With only two games remaining

- Syracuse: Life without the Pearl

By Jim Urban

Eclitor—in—Chief

Editor's Note: The Big East confer-
ence lost several of the nation’s bet-
ter basketball players, including
Dwayne ”The Pearl” Washington of
Syracuse and Walter Berry of St.
/ohn’s, to the National Basketball As-
sociation last spring. The upcoming
season promises to reveal the new
stars of perhaps the nation's best
basketball conference. This is the first
in a series ofarticles previewing the
1986-87 Big East basketball season,
the up—and-coming teams and the
players to watch.

For three years, he was the most
exciting player in the Big East. He
came from the metropolitan New
York area to a rural school that played
basketball between the sidelines of
its football field. He is Dwayne
Washington.

He set a career assist record at Syra— .
cuse and was the best shooter in the
Big East last year, hitting 55 percent
from the field. He is ”The Pearl.”

He passed up his senior year of
NCAA eligibility and now plays for
the New Jersey Nets of the NBA. He
is gone.

Preview
 

That is the reality that faces Syra—
cuse basketball coach Jim Boeheim
and the 27,000-plus fans that show
up at the Carrier Dome every time
Syracuse has a home game.

For three years, Dwayne ”The
Pearl” Washington was Syracuse
basketball. As Washington went, so
went the Orangemen. When Syra-
cuse needed a basket, the ball was
in Washington's hands.

After saying during all of last sea-
son that he would not go hardship to
the NBA, Washington did it anyway
and left Boeheim without an ex-
perienced backcourt and without a
team leader.

Boeheim thought he had landed
the player who could step in and '
stabilize the position Washington va-
cated when he signed high school
A||—America Earl Duncan from Los
Angeles last winter, but Duncan was
declared academically ineligible un-
der Proposition 48.

So what does he do now? Boeheim
is left with one experienced guard,
6-3 senior Greg Monroe, and a bevy
of young, unproven talent.

”What can you say?” Boeheim
asked. ”No one guy can possibly

come close to taking Dwayne’s
place. You have to fill his shoes with
a combination of guys.”

That means Monroe, Sherman
Douglas, a 6-0 sophomore from
Washington D.C., and 6-4 freshman
Stevie Thompson from L.A.’s Cren-
shaw High School will have to han-
dle two guard positions.

Last year, Syracuse played one
guard at a time. Boeheim went with
Washington, three forwards and a
center most of the time. That will
change this year.

”Last year we went with one guard
because of Dwayne,” Boeheim said.
”This year we will have two guards
in the game at all times. Hopefully
that will help our ball-handling and

compensate for Dwayne not being

there.”

But there are other pieces to the
puzzle that must be replaced, too.
Gone, along with ”The Pearl,” are a
couple of other jewels: 6-7 Rafael Ad-
dison and 6-9 Wendell Alexis. Both
departed for the NBA, and with them
went a combined 30.2 ppg. Add
Washington's 17.3 ppg, and Syracuse
lost 61 peicent of last year's point
production.

For The Pitt News

Gymnastics is nothing new to Deb-
bie Yohman, Pitt's new women's
gymnastics coach. For the last 20
years, she has been competing in or
coaching gymnastics.

While in high school in Memphis,
Tenn., Yohman competed for a pri-
vate club team and as a Class I gym-
nast. She then went on to compete
"collegiately for Clarion University in
Pennsylvania. .

Yohman recalls her best event as
vault, but her favorite was the beam.
She competed on all four events

V throughout her first three years of col-

lege and worked as the student assis-
tant coach during her last year.

In 1977, Yohman graduated from
Clarion with a degree in elementary

education. She went on to the
University of Iowa where she com-
pleted her graduate work and worked
as the graduate assistant coach. At
some point, Yohman worked as the
tennis coach, although she could not
hit the ball over the net herself.

After leaving Iowa, Yohman be-
came the head coach of gymnastics
at the University of Wisconsin at Mil-
waukee. After three years, Yohman
moved on to being the assistant
coach at Oklahoma State University.
For four years, Yohman’s job consist-
ed of coaching beam and floor and
judging bars and vault.

Last winter, Yohman applied for
the job as head of Pitt's women's
gymnastics program. She got the job,
replacing Donna Sanft, who became
the head of Women Athletes Affairs.

State's program is comparable to
Pitt's. Both teams consistently rank in
the Top 20 nationally.

Yohman’s goal .or her new team is
similar to the goals that the gymnasts
themselves have set. ”We want to
improve our regional standing,” said
Yohman. ”If we can't beat Penn State

or Ohio State, then we can come"

closer to them."

The Pitt women's gymnastics team
has a tough season ahead of them,
though. ‘Withonly three home meets
on the schedule, and two of these
counting toward the combined
regional score, the gymnasts have to
come through consistently at home.

Yohman stated that setting high ex-

" pectations for her team is a big part

of her coaching philosophy. ”I expect
my athletes to be the best that they
can be,” said Yohman. ”It’s a
challenge to bring out their best.”

It will be a tough order for Pitt to
make the nationals in 1987, though.
Toward that goal, Yohman said, ”We
have to beat Penn State and Ohio
State. That is the easiest way, and
that's not easy at all.”

Although Pitt's actual season does
not begin until January, there is an
intra-squad meet later in November
and a preseason meet against IUP in
December to help Yohman and her
assistant coach Louie Ligouri decide
on the Lady Panthers’ line-up.

Canadian native a star in volleyball

By Kelley Butt

Sta ff Writer

Lady Panther volleyball setter
Louise O’Shaughnessey’s career at
Pitt can be summed up in one word:
underestimated. The junior from
Toronto, Canada, is finishing her
third year in a Pitt uniform. .

Originally, O’Shaughnessey didn't
intend to play collegiate volleyball.
In fact, she didn't plan on coming to
the United States to go to college.
Coach Shelton Collier just happened
to find Louise playing in a tourna-
ment at which he was evaluating
another recruit.

”l was very impressed with
Louise's attitude. She seemed to have
a very team-oriented view,” stated
Collier. ’’I knew that she had the

- potential to become a great player.”

O’Shaughnessey noted, ”Coming
to Pitt was the best thing that I've ever
done. I looked at the chance to play
volleyball in the Unites States as an
opportunity. I don't regret making the
decision to play volleyball.”

Although volleyball is a fairly
popular sport in Canada, colleges do
not offer athletic scholarships. Aca-
demics are the sole basis for accep-
tance into a university.

Louise said, ”My family was very
_supportive of me. They helped make
my decision to come to Pitt easy. I
had every intention of going to
school in Canada, but I really liked
the coach and the [then] Pitt players.”
She added,”Shelton is a greatrcoach.
He sincerely does everything for his
players. When I decided to come to
Pitt, I was comfortable with the de-
cision.” -

Though the basic fundamentals of
the game are the same, volleyball
played in the Unites States is a much
more intense game than that played
in Canada. O’Shaughnessey noted,

Luxbacher content about soccer future

By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team finished its
1986 campaign with an impressive
10-5-2 record.

”Looking back on the season, I
thought our players overall did a real
good job,” said Coach Joe Lux-
bacher.

”They finished strong. We went
through sort of a rough time during
the middle of the season where we
lost a couple of games that we actu-
ally dominated but couldn't score.
The team hung in there; they kept
working hard. I'm very pleased
overall.

”To win 10 games, considering
[that] coming into the season we had
so many question marks, is very
good,” Luxbacher continued. ”We
had a goalie who had never really
played in a varsity game. We lost a
couple of players to injury or ineligi-

”It took a while for me to adjust to
the added pressure, but I really en-
joy it. You get so much more out of
yourself with the added intensity.”

Another factor that has played an
important role in this season is trav-
el time. The Lady Panthers have been
on the road for the last four week-
ends. As Louise noted, ”It [traveling]
takes a lot out of the team. It's very
tiring, but it's worth it.”

In her first season as a setter (she
was an outside hitter as a freshman
and sophomore), O’Shaughnessey
has had a lot of responsibility on her
shoulders. The responsibility shows
in terms of team performance. Instead

strange.”

It may be even stranger if return-
ing center Rony Seikaly continues to
have problems with a lame ankle.

Boeheim said in New York last
week that Seikaly will not be ready
to play until conference time in ear-
ly January.

That leaves Boeheim doing a lot of
guessing. P

Syracuse is preparing for the worst
right now, acting as if Seikaly will
never return.

”If he is not in there,” Boeheim
said, ”I guess we are as ready as we
will ever be.”

Seikaly averaged 10.1 ppg and 7.8
rpg last year as the Orange posted a
26-6 record. He was picked
preseason All—Big East last week by
the Big East coaches.

Joining Triche on the Seikaly-less
front line is 6-9 sophomore Rodney
Walker, 6-9 junior Derek Brower and
6-7 sophomore Herman Harried. The
three combined for a total 6.8 ppg
last season, not exactly an impressive
total. Derrick Coleman, a 6-9 fresh-
man from Detroit, Mich., may help,
but Triche may be the one who steps
forward with or without Seikaly in the
lineup.

”With the loss of Raf [Addison] and
Wendell [Alexis], it will give me a
chance to be more aggressive offen-
sively and basically get everybody
more involved in the offense,” Triche
said.

But then, there is the matter of dis-
tributing the ball — a chore that
Washington gladly did for the past
three seasons.

’’Hopefully there is life after
Dwayne Washington,” Triche added.
”He is an exceptional player, and I
don't think, in this decade, anyone
will take his place.”

”No one can replace him,” Mon-
roe reaffirmed, ”but as a team, maybe
we can replace him.”

7. ,4l.‘ aka .i.,. i;,,..

bility, and we graduated five seniors.
So it was virtually a whole new team
coming in.”

It has been a season of ups and
downs. Pitt started off by winning
their first five games and then tied
Ohio State. Next it was off to the Mar-
shall Tournament, where they cap-
tured first place by beating Morehead
State and Vanderbilt. The Panthers
returned home to play West Virginia,
whom they lost to for their first loss
ofthe season. Next came Seton Hall
and another loss. At this point Pitt
wanted to prove how good they real-
ly were, and Youngstown State was
the victim.

Next on the schedule was Big East
rival Georgetown; it was also Pitt's
third loss. The Panthers came back to
face Robert Morris but were beaten
again. Pitt's winless streak continued
as they tied St. John's and lost to
Carnegie-Mellon. The Panthers end-
ed their season on a high note by
beating both Villanova and IUP.
Along the way, their biggest margin

of playing defensively, O’Shaughnes-
sey finds that the offensive flow is
contingent upon her performance.

Louise noted, ’’I am more defen-
sive-minded than I am offensive-
minded, but I am working on my
concentration.” Consistency is a must
for the setter of any team. Louise add-
ed, ”I think our team would be bet-
ter off if the setters were more
experienced. I feel that sometimes,
because of my inexperience, I hold
the team back.”

O’Shaughnessey seems to have
handled the change well. The losses
Pitt has suffered this season have
been inflicted by quality opponents
like Penn State Westrn Michigan

of victory was 10-0 (Youngstown
State), and their worst defeat was 4-0
(Seton Hall).

One of the best things this year was
the playing stamina of goalie Mark
Hendricks. He finished the season
with nine shutouts, just one short of
the all-time Pitt record.

”There was a lot of pressure thrust
onto Mark's shoulders,” said Lux-
bacher. ”Since our other goalies were
out with injuries, he was really the
only healthy goaltender. If he hadnot
come through with good, solid play,
we would have really had problems.
Mark is a self-motivated individual.
Since he knew that the others were
hurt, he may have had the tendency
to relax. But he wants to be the best
that he can be; he hung in there and
kept working. Mark did a great job
for us.

”We also had a lot of other play-
ers who had not been in starting roles
before they assumed leadership, and
[they] did a good job,” Luxbacher
continued. ’’If we didn't have that,

 

and Santa Barbara. Pitt and
O’Shaughnessey have the caliber to
make a respectable NCAA bid.

As a freshman, O’Shaughnessey
was a key factor in leading Pitt to a
Big East title. Though her role was
mainly supportive, she was very in-
ﬂuenﬂaL

Coach Collier pointed out that
O’Shaughnessey has earned the
respect of teammates and coaching
staff alike. ”Louise has one of the best
team orientedattitudes that I've ever
coached. She's always willing to
make a personal sacrifice. As a per-
son and as a player, she's one ofthe
briht spots here itt” Cllir said.

we would have had a poor season.
People like Kurt Weber and Seckin
Ablack filled in well. Todd Smith
played extremely well in the back.
Danny Liberati, who has been the
center of our defense for the last three
years, had another great season.

"We also had a fine group of fresh-
men. Bryan Hammond had a good
year, and I think he learned a lot.
Scott Armstrong and Jim Bottamely
came in at times and did a good job.
Although the freshmen didn't play
that much, I think they are going to
be key players in the future. It was
a total team effort,” added Lux-
bacher.

Although this season was filled
with good things, Luxbacher also saw
a few disappointments.

”Some guys who we had counted
on in past years suffered injuries.
Scott Reimer played in a few games,
but his knee didn't hold up. Sam Lan-
za and John Osberg also struggled all
year. If they could have stayed
healthy, they might have been a

dominant force.”

In the scoring department, Erim
Gude finished the season with five
goals and six assists for a total of 16
points. Mike Grimes was a close sec-
ond with five goals and three assists
for 13 points. John Chauvin had nine
points, and he got all of them against
Youngstown State. Pitt outscored its
opponents 38 goals to 15.

”Coming into this season, a lot of
people thought that Pitt would not
have a good season because we lost
so many guys from last year. We end-
ed up surprising some people," said
Luxbacher. ”Once the players get on
the field, all I can do is watch. I ha-

.ven’t scored a goal all year. I com-

mend them for their success.”

So another soccer season has
passed. All that is left is to look for-
ward to the next. ”We have a good
nucleus coming back,” Luxbacher
said. ”If we can get some players
who can help us on the [offensive] at-
tack area, I think we can be success-
ful again next year.”

_ THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November I2, I986

Mc Rae

Continued from page 9
it will help me reach my goal of 5.95
for this year.”

Every athlete's goal is to perform in
the Olympics. McRae is no different
from the rest in this respect. Seoul,
Korea is that long-term goal that
looms on the horizon.

”I have alwaysidreamt of compet-
ing in the Olympics. And I believe in
myself that I can do it now," com-
mented McRae. ’’It is still a long way
off. I take everything day by day, and
I feel that the good Lord planned all

P of our lives and whatever happens,

happens.” I

Despite the length of time between
now and Seoul in '88, McRae feels
that he should be a legitimate con-
tender.‘

”| feel that I should be around the
top in 1988. I feel that if I keep up
with what I am doing now and, bar-
ring any serious injuries, there is no
doubt in my mind that I will be there
in contention,” said McRae.

To the layman track observer, the
question why someone with the tal-
ent of Lee McRae came 500 miles
north to run track here at Pitt might
arise, but Coach Vasvary puts this
speculation aside.

”I think he really l_iked the school,”
said Vasvary. ”I think he saw where
the program was heading and that
made him feel that he was going to
be treated well here, both as a per-
son and as an athlete. It was a.com-
bination. When he was a senior in
high school, we [the Panther track
squad] came down to North Caroli-
na for a meet against local powers
North Carolina State and the Univer-
sity of,North Carolina. Some of his
coaches were at the meet and saw us
win. I think that that also was a fac-
tor in his decision to attend Pitt.”

McRae added that his competitive
friendship with past rival and now
teammate, senior Alan Laws, aided
in his decision to come to Pitt.

”Alan had a lot of effect on my
coming here,” added McRae. ’’I had
met him in club meets during the
summer, and he had said some nice
things about Pitt, and that made me
want to become a part of it.”

Laws elaborated on this, adding
that many of the same factors that at-
tracted him to Pitt helped convince
McRae to come here,

’’I had known Lee for a while
through competing against him,” said
Laws. ”We had similar high school
backgrounds. I talked to him about

the situation here at Pitt and told him
how the university had given me a
fair shake both academically and ath-
letically. I also told himhow the pro-
gram was building and was heading
in the right direction.”

When McRae first came to Pitt, he
was recruited in track as a sprinter
and i_n football as a wide receiver.
McRae would like to participate in
both if he could, but at the same time,
he feels that football could jeopardize
his track success.

”When I first came to Pitt, Coach
Fazio wanted me to gain 30 pounds,”
said McRae. ”I didn't think that I
could gain 30 pounds and still be
competitive in track. I was then
forced to choose between track and
football. Then early on with Coach
Gottfried, I thought about playing
football again, but then I looked at
my track record here at Pitt and I
decided to stick with a good thing
and pursue track until the '88 Olym-
pics in Seoul. After that I might try
football.

”I love both sports, and I would
like to play both if I could. When I
left high school I actually preferred
football. I really have no regrets, but
I am a little disappointed that I
couldn't play both.”

As a coach once said, ”Don’t look
back, someone might be gaining on
you!” McRae seems to follow this
philosophy to a tee.

”I just go out and compete the best
that I can. I go out with the attitude
that I can run against anyone and
win,” said McRae. ’’I really have no

rivalries, I just take one [sprinter] on ~

at a time because when you think too
much about one guy, another will
come up and catch you. There are
too many great sprinters to concen-
trate on just one guy.”

The specter of steroids ‘always
looms over international competi-
tion, and track and field might be the
second most ‘popular?’ sport, behind
weightlifting, where concern is grow-
ing. McRae acknowledges the exis-
tence of steroids, but at the same
time, he does not see how they could
benefit him.

’’I couldn't see myself taking drugs
to become a better athlete. I am on
top now, and I got here naturally
[without drugs], so why should I use
drugs? But then again, there are peo-
ple currently on the circuit using
drugs — mainly the foreign athletes.
But I don't let it affect me, though.”

McRae never remains complacent
with his performance. He always
finds some aspect of his race to im-
prove. ”I have a tendency to look to
the side in races,” McRae says. "It
has lost me the race on several oc-
casions."

He also trains all year. In the col-
legiate off-season, McRae runs for the
Caramu Track Club in outer New Jer-
sey under Wilbur Ross, the famous
hurdler coach. Coach Ross is
described by Panther coach Vasvary
as ”one of the top track coaches in
the country.”

All the hoopla surrounding McRae
causes followers to forget that he is
a member of a track team and not just
an independent competitor. McRae
is excited about the Panthers’ success
last year (fifth in the NCAA), and he
is optimistic about the Panthers’
prospects for this season.

”The biggest team goal right now
is winning the Big East meet. This is
not only my team goal, but the whole
team's goal,” said McRae. ”My class
[the junior class] came in as freshmen
with really no one to look up to. We
have been leaders almost the whole
time. We have been talking about
winning‘ the Big East meet for two
years now, and now is the time to do
something about it.

’’We have always thought of our-
selves as a family, and now I feel that
we have jelled into one. As for the
NCAA, we did’ finish fifth in the in-
door meet with only seven people

competing. This year we should im-_

prove on that finish. We have the

capability to put two relay teams and

three hurdlers besides myself, instead
of just one relay team and one hur-
_dler like last year.”

McRae’s individual goals are rela-
tively simple. ”This year I am going
to try to get as close to 5.95 as I_ca'n,”

~ he said. ’’I am going to try to reach
my peak for Oklahoma City again,
like last year.” -

_In a school yearning for athletic
prowess, McRae and the track pro-
gram have enjoyed quiet success. In
the Tower's Lobby with the om-
nipresent football and basketball
players, McRae goes virtually unno-
ticed. This anonymity seems to suit
McRae’s personality perfectly. McRae
stresses that despite all his success,
he will remain the ”same old Lee.”
