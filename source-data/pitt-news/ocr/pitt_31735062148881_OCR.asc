Dean Travels
For European

Lecture Tour

Miss Helen Pool Rush, Dean
of Women at the University,
has been invited by the Brit-
ish—American Associates to

give a series of lectures in
England this fall.

Selected to receive a Winifred
Cullis Lecture-Fellowship, Miss
Rush will lecture in England dur-
ing the six-week Oct. 21 to Nov.
30. During that time she will give
twenty-four lectures on the ed-
ucation of women in the United
States.

Some of the specific subjects
on which she will speak include

“At What is American Educa-
tion Aiming?” “The Contem-

porary American Woman,” and

“Homes and Families in the

United States.”

Discussing her lecture tour Miss
Rush said she will draw many
examples from her experiences as
Dean of Women at the University
of Pittsburgh. She plans to illus-
trate the interest American Uni-
versities -take in educating the
whole person and to stress the
fact that when University life can
be personalized it releases the best
in a person.

Miss Rush will sail from New
York today on the Queen Eliz-
abeth. Following the conclusion
of her lecture series, she will
travel through Germany, Switz-
erland, Italy and France, return-
ing to the campus Feb. 1.

Entrance Tests

Required Here

The University of Pitts-
burgh will require College
Entrance Examination Board
scores of all prospective stu-
dents beginning with the 1958-59
term.

Admissions Director Bernard
Adams said the exams’ are an-
other" step to put the university
“in line with the ﬁnest institu-
tions in the country.” He added:

“It gives a more uniform

yardstick by which we can
judge the applicant’s suitability
for college work.”

Under Pitt's old system of ad-
mitting students, high school grad-
‘uates in the upper two-ﬁfths of
their class were not required to
take entrance examinations.

No students will be exempt un-
der the new ruling.

Adams said that failure in the
tests will not necessarily exclude
a student. Those will be judged

on their high school achievement
records and, the recommendations
of their principals.

lounge as a second student lounge
area; and the installation of two
self-service elevators. The ball-
room has been kept for campus

dances and other student affairs.

WQED Initiates Series

Of Medical

Programs

WQED opened a series of 13 medical programs entitled

' “World of Medicine” on Sunday when it presented the intro-

ductory show. The second show, which is the ﬁrst of the act-
ual series, will be shown this Sunday at 11:30 am. It will be

repeated Monday at 8 p.m.,
in the series.

The series, the ﬁrst to s»temO~

from a_ newly developed plan
whereby private industry is in-
vited to endow nationally dis-
tributed educational TV programs,
is being produced under a public
service grant from Schering Cor-
poration, pharmaceutical manu-

‘facturer. It is being telecast over

some 30 other educational tele-
vision stations throughout the
nation.
“Veterinary Medicine”
The show this Sunday, entitled

S “Veterinary Medicine,” is a View
-of the veterinarian’s world, where

the work that goes on has a direct
bearing on the health and treat-
ment of human beings.
Appearing as guest on the
show will be Dr. Jacob Siegrist,
veterinary medicine department
of the Schering Corporation.
Among the programs included
in the series are “The Nurse,”
which dramatizes the importance

~_ of the nurse in the daily life of

the hospital; “Recovery Room,” a
camera-tour showing where pa-
tients are taken following surgery

and how lives are now saved that .

earlier might have been lost.
Blood Pressure Taken
Also included in the series are
“The Eye,” which uses the camera
itself to show near-and far—sight—
edness, blurred vision and other
abnormalities; “Geriatrics,” a pic-
torial survey of a growing medi-
cal. specialty; and “alergy,” which
explains the allergic process and
shows what can be done about it.
A demonstration of taking
blood pressure is believed to be

u.-
D

as will each of the programs

the ﬁrst demonstration to be
shown on television. Another

television first will be the dis-

cussion on the use of hormones.

In this program, several patients
relate their experiences and tell

how hormones have helped

them.

Narrating the “World of Medi-
cine” series will be Ken Nordine,
previously active in both radio
and television. Nordine has ap-
peared on such shows as “What’s
My Line?” “Arthur Godfrey and
His Friends,” and “Captain Mid-
night.”

Dryer Produces

Sherman H. Dryer, a veteran in
the ﬁeld of mass communication
for -education, is the producer of
the series. Since 1944, Mr. Dryer
has had his own production ﬁrm
specializing in scientiﬁc and pub-
lic service programs.

Some of these programs are:
“The VVorld We Live In,” “Heri-
tage,” “The Great Adventure,”
“The Search That Never Ends,”
“Exploring the Unknown,” a
dramatic series for Encyclo-
pedia Britannica and another
for Collier’s Encyclopaedia.

Dryer was an oﬁicial observer
at the Conference on Peaceful
uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva
in 1955. He also served as the
American representative at the
International Scientiﬁc Film Con-
gress in London.

The premiere of the series was
held in New York by the recently
formed Organization for National

 

lead members of Phi Eta Sigma,

man honorary fraternity, in an after-dinner dis-
cussion of the aims and purposes of the organi-

zation. This was the ﬁrst meeting

the group and was held in'Parlors A and B of
the Student Union. At the meeting, chairman of

Support of Educational Television S

(ONSET). This organization was
established with the idea that pri-
vate industries would be invited
to endow nationally distributed
educational television programs
without inﬂuence over program
content.

In this way, ONSET enforces
the educational independence of
the programs. Patrons are ac-
cepted only by invitation.
Schering Corporation’s accep-
tance made it the ﬁrst company

to support this new approach
for the development of national
educational television."

The “patron” approach will en-
able educational TV to produce
quality programs on a national
basis without the controls of com-
mercial sponsorshipfbut with the
supportgof business ﬁrms. Until
now, educational TV program-
ming has been almost entirely
local and has been supported by
funds from civic, school and phil-

' anthropic groups and individuals.

 

discussed plans for the free service conducted an-
nually in freshmen courses by the group. A com-
plete program for free tutoring in chemistry,
biology, mathematics, German, and English I will
be set up for the beneﬁt of both men and women
students. Phi Eta Sigma expects to have the plan
in operation one month earlier than usual. Dr.
Gray spoke to the society on the responsibilities
of scholarship.

1 According to John W. Taylor,
executive director of the Chicago
Educational Television Associa-
tion, “The, concept of the patron
places educational television on
the threshhold of new adventures
in creative programming. “World
of Medicine’ is a pioneering proj-
ect in educational television.”
After the initial showing of the
13 programs, the kinescopes will
be made available by Schering
Corporation to medical and lay
educational and civic groups.

The awardee stated that the
stories concerning the Sheffield

taxes are true. “The outlook for

getting ahead is not too bright,” w

he commented in reference» to the
economic situation.
+ Hoover attributes the lack of
motivation on the part of work-
ers to -the remains of Socialism
and the high luxury taxes which
are thirty-three and one—third
per cent above purchase price.
His salary of $21 per week was
adequate for room, board, carfare,
and spending money.
Visited Widely
The student’s itinerary included
visits to Dinboro, London, Paris,
Geneva, Rome, Florence, Frank-
fort, Cologne, and Amtserdam. He
was particularly impressed by the
absence of rain and fog in London
where he spent a week.

In trying to describe Rome,
Hoover said, ‘flt deﬁes my lim-
ited vocabulary.” He regards it
as the city which has every-‘‘
thing. Discussing Italian food,\
he summed up by saying, “I ate
better and more in Italy than in
any other place.”

The closest he came to any of

abroad was the day he missed
seeing Carolyn Mazur, French
‘Scholarship recipient, by
hours at the American Express in
Genoa.

He describes the Finns as a
“warm and friendly people”
who know a "lot about our his-
tory and standard of living.
“They are the most considerate
and sincere_ people I have ever
met.”

The student was surprised by
the fact that much of the hard
work such as cleaning streets and
laboring in the ﬁelds is done by

women. He also noted the poli-

tical situation of "the tiny ‘coun-
try with its neighbor, Russia.
“They are forced to trade with

“Russia to maintain their ‘friend-

ship’,” he wrote in his mid-sum-
mer report to the University.

Wise was pleased to discover
that some of the textbooks which
he used in studying chemistry
at Pitt are being used in Fin-.
land and Germany. “I had the
pre-formed opinion that Ger-

gineering, but I believe that we
Americans are tops in the tech-

statement he added that half of
the. books he found in the tech-
nical library at the University
of Urich are American.

The scholarship winner toured
Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and
Stockholm before his arrival in
Finland. He described Amsterdam
as having “the most bicycles and
oldest trolleys of anyplace I've
seen.” The sight of the Dutch
people actually wearing wooden
shoes fascinated him. “The
wooden shoes are good for work-
ing in the moist bulb ﬁelds and
looked to be rather comfortable,"
he admitted later. 0

More Than Meets The Eye

Not»-enough has been said about the disgusting situ-
ation that occurred at the Pitt-Oklahoma football game.

Those who were not involved in the grandstand blunder
probably don’t realize just what an injustice was done to
students at that game. Many students who arrived as much

A as one-half hour before kickoff time were forced to stand

in the aisles. Those that arrived later never got out of
the ramps and into the_ stands. Still others, roughly one
hundred, were never admitted to the stadium. They ar-
rived at the student gates to ﬁnd them locked.

Now for the few that did get into the aisles and ramps
the Pittsburgh Police provided an unnecessary insult by
stupidly insisting that the fans clear the aisles by standing
on the ﬁeld, even though the top aisles of the stadium,

.which could easily accommodate several hundred and are

not used for emergencies, was empty. The police them-
selves, once the aisles were clear, sat down and used the
aisles as reserved seats. This included the lieutenant in
charge.

The reasons for this unprecedented crowding of the
student section was obvious to anyone who was seated in
the student section or saw the half formed Block ‘P’ stunts
from the ﬁeld.

_There were a great, great many people in the student
section who were not students, not faculty, in fact not any-
body who had any relationship with Pitt outside of their
ability to secure tickets for the student section.

It is doubtful that -the same situation could. occur at
the relatively unheralded Nebraska game this weekend,
but-in the coming month there will be some very important

' games. Games which might determine the Eastern cham-

pionship. This will mean big gates and wide spectator in-
terest.

If the same situation again leaves students in the cold
while hundreds of high-paying non—student “fans” take
over the student section, the PITT NEWS will want more
answers. And they had better be good ones.

Samuel Pepys ——-_ Curioso

(rnzroirs NOTE: Fitzhugh
Schenley, last year’s roving re-
porter on the Oakland and
Shadyside beats, is now, in line
with the New Era at Pitt, re-
viewing books for the PITT
NEWS).

By FIZHUGH SCHENLEY

David G. Weiss, director of
Men’s Glee Club and assistant
professor of music, has packed the
story of late seventeenth century
England into a small book about
Samuel Pepys and the music he
loved. Samuel Pepys, Curioso is
more than an account of one man
and his fascination with music.
It is a history of the times, and the
years of Pepys’ Diary, 1660-1669,
were exciting ones in England.

The term “curioso” is explained
Weiss’ preface. “It de-
scribes,” according to the Wheat-
ley edition quoted, “the intelli-
gent inquirer whose business was
the public service, but whose

amusement was general knowl-

edge.”

Such a description ﬁts Pepys
exactly, and the Professor takes
as his theme Pepys’ curiosity and

not another period
but i do not
appreciate his
viewpoint because
good politics is

real good business

Fourth Conference on Business

To Be Staged atWebster Hall

The Fourth Pitt Conference on Business Prospects is to
be held this year on Nov. 1, at Hotel Webster Hall.

The purpose of this conference is to get an idea of what

sults for Top Management.”

During the afternoon session,
four seminars are scheduled.

They include: “The Impact of
the Road Construction Program
on the Economy,” “The Impact of
Discretionary Spending on the
Economy,” “Is the Business Cycle
Obsolete?” and “Patents and Re-

searchiin the Future Organziation
of the Steel Industry.”

Following dinner will be an-

other seminar entitled, “Let’s
Look Ahead.” Dr. A. C. Van
Dusen, assistant Chancellor of

Pitt, will preside at dinner, and

foresee business prospects in the
future.

Those attending this conference
are research workers, and execu-
tives who will turn in to their
individual companies a direct re-
port of the meeting.

Book Printed
By University
On Pepys Life

The University of Pittsburgh
Press has just published Samuel
Pepys, Curioso, an account of!
amateur and professional music
in England of the Restoration as
Samuel Pepys viewed it and took
part in it. '

The author is David G. Weiss,
associate professor of music his-
tory and literature at the Uni-
versity. Weiss conceived the idea
of such a book at the University
of Iowa in 1952 and concluded
the last bit of research for the
book in the Pepysian Library at
Magdalene College, Cambridge
University in 1956.

“Samuel Pepys, Curioso” con-
tains important information about
all the great musicians of the
time, as well as minor, but none
the less signiﬁcant ones.

The author also discusses in-
struments of the time, such as
the flageolet, (recorder, theorbo.
violin, guitar, angelique, and dul-
cimer and others.

The instruments are beautifully
illustrated by Charles Richard
Moore of Pittsburgh.

Government Opens
Examinations To
Juniors In College

The Civil Service Commission
has announced that the Federal
Government is opening its Fed-
eral-Service_ Entrance Examina-
tion to college juniors in addi-
tion to seniors, college graduates
and others of equivalent experi-
ence.

Juniors and seniors who pass
the examination will be eligible
for job appointments, effective
after graduation. Their names
will be placed on the list of elig-
ibles which is to be established.

The first Federal—Service En-
trance Examination is scheduled
for Nov. 16, and subsequent ex-
aminations will be held in Jan._.
Feb., Mar. and May, 1958. Ap-
plicants have until Oct. 31 to ﬁle
for the Nov. written testf

The positions ﬁlled through the
examination are in nearly every
field of work. During the year
1957 more than 7,500 job appoint-
ments in 175 different occupations
were made of persons who passed
the examination.

The Commission estimates that
during the next 12 months at least
the same number of entrance-
level jobs, at salaries ranging
from $3,670 to $4,525 per year,
will be ﬁlled from the FSEE lists
of eligibles.

WSGA To Hold Meet
To Vote Name Change

The Women’s Self Government Association will hold an
open meeting next Wednesday, Oct._l6, at 7 p.m. in 1228 CI.
for the purpose of voting on the proposed name change of the

organization.

All undergraduate full-time women students are invited
to take part in the discussion and voting. Gladys Flesher,

Chief Justice of Senior Court, willO

read and explain the proposed
amendments to the by-laws which
would be made necessary by the
change in name.

Dinner will not be served to
members of the Commission prior

to the open business as is the
usual procedure.
Chris Taylor, president, sug-

gested the change to Associated
Women Students at the annual
WSGA retreat early last month.
'ihe Commission approved the
the idea. She gave two basic rea-
sons for the decision.

First, the Pitt women students
are members of the Intercollegiate
Association of Women Students,
which prefers that its members
call themselves AWS for the sake
of uniformity.

~ Secondly, according to Miss
Taylor, the meaning of the word
“self-government” has been mis-
understood to mean the governing
of the campus women by means of
legislation. Its actual

interpreta .

tion, however, is the self expres-
sion of each member as part of a
policy making body rather than a
legislative group.

At the last business meeting,
held Oct. 2, Esther Mishelevich,
IAWS representative, discussed
the national organization. There
are 140 member schools in the
country, divided into four regions.

Pitt, Allegheny, and Penn State
are the three members in the
state. They are in regioh four. The
regional meeting is set for April 2
through 5 at the University of
West Virginia. Miss Mishelevich
also reported on the national con-
vention held last March at Michi-
gan State University. -

The Customs Committee will
sponsor a fashion show to high-
light its customs program Oct. 11
from 3 to 5 p.m. in 1228 C1. Both
freshman and upperclass women
will serve as models. Subject is
“What to Wear When.” Chairman
is Sally Nelson, Col. ’59. '

Panthers Home

Host Nebraska

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

Lcking his victory wounds, the
twice victorious Panther returns
to his home lair this Saturday to
entertain the winless playboys of
the University of Nebraska. The
opening kickoff at the Stadium is
set for 1:15 p.m. and the Blue and
Gold should be favored to make
it three straight.

As it stands now, the greatest
obsticle that Coach John Mich
elosen and his aides face in ready-
ing the Jungle Cats for Saturday
is the long injury list. Quarter-
back Bill Kaliden, halfback Jim
Theodore, and fullback Dick
Bowen are the starters heading
the long list. Kaliden’s right thigh
was rather badly bruised by a
ﬂying tackle late in the first half
of Friday’s game with Southern
Cal.

Jim Theodore appeared brieﬂy
in the evening affair, but just

-brieﬂy enough to re-strain his bad

knee. However, he should be
ready to go on the opening whis-
tle. The fate of Bowen still re-
mains somewhat up in the air.
Bowen hurt his ankle in the Okla-
homa debacle, but it was not be-
lieved at the time to be serious.
However, he has yet to enter a
game with that tricky injury.

Injuries Sideline Starters
If Bowen does not start, now
that the Western swing is com-
plete and familiar Stadium sod is
underfoot, it is questionable

.whether or not his understudy Bob

Stark will ﬁll in. Stark was

The score of 20-14 was not
a clear indication of the local’s
edge. They led in every depart-
ment but passing yardage and
fumbles, but for a tideof pen-
alties, which at times appeared
all engulﬁng, the score might
have been higher in the Blue
and Gold’s favor.

The disparity in experience be-
tween the ﬁrst and second team
lines is decreasing. Twice against
Southern Cal, the line was pla-
tooned as Coach Michelosen em-
ployed a complete switch in man-
power. Linemen Rathi, Westwood,
Michaels, Crafton, Humeston, and
Gob got to see, collectively, more
action than any other time in the
season. This speaks well for the
improvement of the team as a
whole.

Huskers May Surprise  

Panther Winning Streak

By MURRAY CHASS .
The Nebraska Cornhuskers could make trouble for the
Panthers this Saturday at the Stadium if certain facts that
they have in common. with the unbelievable Oklahoma Soon-

ers could help.

First of all, Bill Jennings, the Cornhusker coach, has a
long background with the Sooners. He played his college foot-

ball there from 1938 through 19400

and later returned to the Sooner
fold as backﬁeld coach for seven
years through the 1953 season.

_The second point Saturday’s op-
ponent has in common with the
Southwesterners is that they are
both members of the Big Eight
Conference.

Finally Nebraska points with
pride to the fact that a local
cattle rancher will “wheel out his
private plane and fly members
of his family 500 miles” to see a
Cornhusker game.

However, only the ﬁrst com-
mon fact could help the visitors
on the gridiron. And even this
has not done anything for the
weak Huskers. As the old story
goes, you just don’t produce a
winning team without the neces-
sary personnel. '

As Nebraska’s ﬁrst three games
show, they don’t have the per-
sonnel. Washington State downed
them, 34-12, and Army shellack-
ed them, 42-0. Only last Saturday
were the Huskers able to come
through with a. victory, 14-7, over
a so-so Kansas State squad.

Possibly the reason for the
Huskers’ ineptness on the grid-
iron is the failure to come up with
their strongest starting team. At
the beginning of Fall practice
Coach Jennings had intended to
start senior George Harshman at
quarterback, Leo George and
Larry Naviaux at the halves, and
Jerry Brown at ‘fullback.

But after the ﬁrst three games
Harshman is nowhere to be found

and George is just holding on. For
the upcoming tussle it appears
that Roy Stinnett, whose name

was not even on the ﬁrst three? 

teams earlier in the Fall, will call 0
signals against the Panthers.

And for the other halfback post,
besides Naviaux, Jennings may
use either Bennie Dillard or Gene
Sandage.

The Huskers have ‘a sophomore
quarterback by the name of Harry
Tolly who has seen quite a bit
of action behind Stinnett. Other
backs who will be trying to run
through the rejuvenated “Five
Jumbos” are Carroll Zaruba and
George Cifra, a tri—lettering full-
back. — *

If the situation on the line is
anything like that in the back-
ﬁeld the following players pro-
bably won’t start against the
locals. First of all, four linesmen,
who are listed as members of the

ﬁrst eleven, have won two letters. ’ .

These are Left Tackle Don
Rhoda, Left Guard Jerry Petersen,
Right Guard Don“ Kampe, and
Right Tackle Jerry Wheeler. That
leaves Marlin Hilding and Mike
Lee for the ends and Dick Mc-
Cashland at center. i

As for the fans on Saturday,
they better listen to the vendors
who scream, “You can’t tell the
players without the numbers."
For without a scorecard, they
won’t be able to tell if Nebraska
or the Panther freshmen are play-

JACK I-IOROX
On starting line

Otherwise the squad is in fine
physical shape.

Even though the Pitt Booters
won their second game of the
young campaign, Coach Bemis
took a pessimistic view, of last
Saturday’s game. He commented
“We looked ragged on offense,
even though we scored three
goals. Our passes were not sharp
or the shots on goal true.” The
head-mentor is quick to add, “and
many of our “players were out the

no practice sessions.”

Bemis will continue to alternate
starting lines if at all possible be-
cause of the success in the ﬁrst
two games. He will start the game
with the line of Sam Hazou,
Chuck Kane, Pete Karavellis.
Jack Horox, and Jim Graham.

On alternate line he will have
Bob Kalchthler, Lee Goodman,
Shrinsky, Simeon Pestich, and Ed

for praise. Kipp,‘ Eisinger, Bres-
sanelli and Hester all drew ac-

colades for their fine defensive,

play that successfully contained
the Dennison Big Red offense.

The head mentor hopes to have
a complete squad on hand for a
week of practice on their oﬁen-
sive passing and team work. Ever.
with this one Chink in their armor
they managed to score three goals
by being opportunists.

arships awarded every year. Any American student, married

or single, may apply. They muste

be under years of age on
Oct. 1, 1958, and have graduated
from an American university.

Each award is worth $1,540 per
year. Passage is paid to and from
the United Kingdom with married
men getting ‘an extra allowance.

MOST POPULAR GAME that ever went to col-
lege—that’s Sticklers! Just write a simple riddle
and a two-word rhyming answer. For example:
What’s a big cat shot full of holes? (Answer:
peppered leopard.) Both words must have the
same number of syllables-—bleak freak, ﬂuent
truant, vinery ﬁnery. Send Sticklers, with your
name, address, college and class to Happy-Joe-
Lucky, Box 67A, Mt. Vernon, N. Y. Don’t do
drawings! We’ll pay $25 for every Stickler we
use in our ads—and for hundreds that never see
print. While you’re Stickling, light up a light
smoke-—light up a Lucky. You'll say it’s the
best-tasting cigarette you ever smoked!
