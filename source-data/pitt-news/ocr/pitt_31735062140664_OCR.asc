ducted at Pitt.

From 2,236 undergraduate stu-
dents, $2,362.30 has been collect-
ed to date, according to figures
released by Theodore W. Biddle,
acting dean of men.

Mr. Biddle pointed out, how-
ever, that all the contributions
were not considered since about
$500 is expected from 965 profes-
sional students as well as future
undergraduate pledges which will
be given in the oﬂices of the dean
of men and women.

Seventy—ﬁve per cent of the
money which is being collected is
turned over to organizations which
are connected directly with the
University. The student loan funds
receive 30 per cent, YMCA-YWCA
40 per cent, and Pitt-in-China five
per cent. The other 25 per cent
which is collected is turned over to
the national United Fund drive,
which benefits the Red Cross, USO,
hospitals, and other relief organ-
izations.

Commenting on the returns, ‘Mr.
Biddle said, “The committee is
well pleased. The reports thus far
indicate that the students are con-
tributing more enthusiastically than
they have in the past.”

The returns fiom the Faculty
drive, begun before the student
drive, have not yet been released,
but if the faculty responds as it
has in preceding years, it will raise
its quota of $7,300.

Speaks at Town
Meeting Monday

Northeastern regional director
of the Steel Workers’ Organizing
committee and» vice-president of
the CIO, Clinton F. Golden, will
discuss the relation of labor to
national defense at Town Meeting
Monday.

William Seyler, C42, chairman,
stated that Golden will be intro-
duced by J. J. Blair, assistant pro-
fessor of economics. ’

“This will be the most well-
known national ﬁgure Town Meet-
ing has presented this year,” Sey-
ler said. “Because of the recent
illness of Phillip Murray, president
of CIO, Golden has played. an im-
portant part in national labor re-
lations during the last few weeks.”

Cummings Leaves
For Washington

Herbert J. Cummings, instructor
in accounting and economics, will
meet his last class at the Univer-
sity today before leaving for Wash-
ington, D. C., to become an econo-

Mr. Cummings was selected by
Secretary of State \Cordell Hull.
and A. A. Berle, assistant secre-
tary of state, to work on the prob-
lem of the ‘frozen European assets
brought about by the present war.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
the School of Business Administra-
tion, announced that Herbert I.
Parnes, giaduate assistant in eco-
nomics, and Frank N. Willetts, in-
structor in accounting, would prob-
ably replace Mr. Cummings.

Commons room.

Over 800 guests 7 are ex-.
pected, and although the cere-‘
mony is primarily for the persons
of Greek descent, all persons in-'
terested may attend. 

Archbishop Atlienagoras, heard
of’ the Greek Orthodox church in
America, will bless the room with
a ceremony akin to the blessing of
a new Greek home.'

Speaking in behalf of the Greek
government, Cimon Diamantopow
los, Greek ambassador to the Uni*i:-
ed States, will deliver the principal
address. <

Nicholas Kalmer, chairman of
the committee for the dedication,
will welcome the assemblage and
introduce the honor guests. Later
in the program he will present the

The Right
To Work?

Editor, the Pitt News:
Mr. Mavrinac, to you the closed

shop seems essential, while I see
it as dangerous tool in the hands

of the laboring man. To be sure
the laborer is entitled to his rights.
But I amvof the contention that
this is not one of them.

i‘ “The closed shop deprives the
individual of his right to work.’_’
Yes, for the heads of the closed
shop can exclude anyone that they
wish from working for a living-by
their so-called “right.” Sure, if the
union heads were virtuous and
‘pure in heart, mind, and soul, they
would not succumb to such evils.
But in reality they ‘do and this we
must face.’

I The closed shopunder such ruth- _

less leaders may even do more——
it ‘may become the"'too1 to elimi-
nate whole groups from working.
Yes, in the face.of facts, what is

there to show that they cannot, if-

they will it, discriminate against
Negro workers or Catholics or any
other sect or -religious body that
they take a dislike to.

Yes, these fears are easily
brushed aside when you say that
‘the closed shop unions will not
have such leadership as mentioned,
but I say that it is not beyond the

power for’ it to happen.

Ifarold Laski Writes Openly    

T o.Neu1°ot1'c American Youth

By ED_GAR BEIGEL

7When Harold Laski writes a
book, American students sit up and
take notice.\ But Harold Laski’s

open letter to American youth-—

The Strategy of Freedom—falls

short of the mark of new ideas we A

expect in a Laski book.

Most of Laski’s new book is a
clear and careful discussion of the
need for the defeat of Nazi Ger-
many, and the impossibility of
peace and security in a’ fascist

‘world. But Laski gave a better dis-.

cussion of the same issue .in
“Where Do We Go From Here?”
published two years ago. And any-
one who can't see the issue by
now is, it would seem, neurotic.

. But this book is written directly
at the American college student-
the cynical, skeptical, student—-
who thinks England equals Ger-
many; in other words, the neurotic.
He should read this book.

How many American college
students are, on this basis, neu-
rotic, I don't pretend to know. But
I do believe that many students
are interested in really ﬁnding out
about the strategy of freedom.

Most students I believe want to
know whether this is to be total
war‘ for-us or not; whether we
must fight or not; whether they
want to ﬁght or not in order to
decide the issue.

This is’ what Laski-like all of

the pleaders on the subject before

him——-fails to account for. If this
is not total war under the above
deﬁnition, then the American stu-

this issue will not ‘be decided by
American students, regardless of
the fact that it is they who will be

book in this respect falls on open
and eager, but unfortunately help-

less, and somewhat fatalistic, ears.’

and GM engineers will do the work:
and this is what is happening here
now. Laski says “my plea is not
a plea for direct American par-
ticipaton . . . we do" not need Ameri-
can manpower for victory.”

Laski instead says our part in
the strategy should be a continu-
ance of Lend-Lease in its broadest
version. But he. nevertheless con-
stantly suggests the idea of direct
participation, as an alternative to

Panthers Last Stumbling Block
On Fordham’ s Bowl Bound Road

By ALEX ZELENSKI
Pitt News Sports Editor

With a ‘backﬁeld that rates above any in the country and
a line that is comparable to the “blocks of granite” of yester-

year, Fo_rdham’s unbeaten Rams hope to add another victim .

in their march to a bowl bid tomorrow afternoon when they
face the victoryless Panthers at the Pitt stadium.

Running up large scores. didn’t mean a thing to Jim

Crowley’s boys in their first ﬁve games, but when they face
their bitter rivals, Pitt, nothing more than a rout would

please the New Yorkers.

This year’s Fordham aggregation is rated above any
other teamthat Crowley has ever coached for in’B1umen- .

stock, Noble, And1'e_ico, and Filipowicz, he can proudly point

to the best balanced backﬁeld in
the country. 0 '

The critics seemed to think that

'the Rain front wall was weak, but V

last week they hit their peak when
they held _Purdue’s ﬁne team with-.
'out a ﬁr_st down during the entire
game.

But oddly enough, whether Pitt
'has an undefeated te’am or just
another ball club, the mention of
the word, Pitt, starts the Fordham
lians worrying. Pitt beat them be-
fore when the had undefeated
teams, and the local fans are ex-
pecting them to do it tomorrow.

It will be the last game in their
seven-year series, so the Pitt grid-
ders are hoping to make that last-
ing impression on the Rams by
knocking them out of the running
for the Eastern title or a possible
bowl bid.

During the Pitt practice sessions
this week the squad looked impres-
sive. This is no criterion, how-
ever, for the team also looked good
before the Purdue, and Duke
games.

Edgar Jones is expected to car-
ry all of the mail up on the Sta-
dium tomorrow, with occasional

help from Bill Dutton and Frank
Saksa. The Fordham Rams will be
out to stop that elusive Mr. Jones
for, no doubt, the Ram scout got
an eyeful last Saturday when Jones
single-handedly threw a scare into
_the Buckeye fans. V A I

Johnny Stahl replaced Marty
Rosepink in the startingilineup last
Wednesday, and should be the act-
ing game captain o'f the (lay.

Bill Dillon’s inspired ball playing
has been the talk of the drills, and
it has moved him into the varsity
lineup ahead of veteran George
Mitchell.

The only other change in the
line was Jack Durishan over Harry
Kindelberger. Kindelberger did
not play the type of ball that he
was capable of playing against
Duke, and Durishan moved into
the left tackle post. Then against
Ohio State, Durishan was a stand-
out on offense and defense, thus
nailing down the position for him-
self.

George Allshouse will again start
the game at center, while Gervelis
and Stahl will take care of the ter-
minal posts. Opposite Durishan
and Dillon will be seasonal captain
Ralph Fife and Bill Benghauser.

Unless the Ambridge draft board
has a change of heart, Eddie Ziol-
kowski, co.-captain of Pitt’s basket-
ball team, won’t _be around when
the current season opens.

“Ziol” was notiﬁed of his 1-A
standing about a month ago. As
he is apsenior he had hoped to ob-
tain a deferment until he complet-
ed this year. With this in mind, he
appealed to his local board for a
re-classiﬁcation. Through a mis-
understanding his appeal was re-
fused and he is still 1-A.

In explaining his position “Ziol”
said, “I only want a postponement
until I graduate in June. I’m not
trying to get out of going.”

He has appealed a second time
and if he is again refused, “Lefty”
said that he would enlist in the air
corps. ‘

AE 8: ME Seniors Topple Frosh, 9-6,-
Sammies Eliminate Pi Lambda Phi

Scoring a. touchdown on the
opening play of the second half,

the AE and ME seniors eked out
a win over the AE and ME frosh
and sophs by a 9 to 6 score, in a
bitterly contested game last Mon-
clay.

The seniors were forced to
come from behind as the fresh and
sophs scored on a pass from
O’Connell to Hohos in the early
stages of the game. O’Connell,
who did most of the passing for
the frosh-sophs, was caught be-
hind his own goal by Samson, and
the half ended 6 to 2 in the fresh-
soph’s favor.

With defeat looming before
hem, the seniors started the sec-
0nd half with a rush. They ran
the-kickoff back to midﬁeld. On the
first play Winkler faded back
quickly and threw a long pass to

,Mamaux in the end zone for the

touchdown. Mamaux then threw
to Winkler for the conversion.

Playing the best ball they have
shown all year Sigma Alpha Mu
knocked the Pi Lams off in their
traditional “battle. for blood"
game, 22-6, last Tuesday. The
Sammies didn’t wait long to start
on their victory march as they
took the opening kick-off and
scored on two quick plays. The
scoring play was a pass from
“Hack” White to Harry Abramo-
vitz. The conversion went from
Abramovitz to Dan Coltin.

A few minutes later the score
rose to 13-0 as White threw to
Coltin. The PiLams ﬁnally scored
as the half was ending. The score
came on a disputed play, as Herb

Krongold took a short pass over
the line and evaded the SAM safe-
ty man.

The second half saw the Sam-
mies toy with their opponents as
they scoredanother touchdown on
a pass from White «to Norman Sa-
polsky. The final scoring play of
the game came on a dropkick field
goal by Joe Aaron from about the
20-yard line.

Earlier in the day Sigma Chi
upset the Delts 6-0, in a bruising
game. Two men were injured in
the contest and had to leave the
ﬁeld under assistance. ’Vicious
blocking marked the entire battle
as a defeat meant elimination for
either team. 0

N ' tt  
$‘Coach Carl 'Olson’s nomad cross
country pack will make their third
consecutive invasion of enemy ter-
ritory tomorrow when they assem-
ble their war equipment_ and make
a drive on State College in an ef-
fort to undermine Penn State’s
crack harrier squad.
The Nittany Lion’s roster is
studded with cross country stars
which are led by Captain Gordon.
‘However, the spearhead of the
State thinclads is Stone, a sensa-
tional sophomore, who is going to
prove to be a thorn in the side of
the Panther team. '

Boiggerie, Goffberg and Thiel
back up this duo as the reserve
power. State possesses one of the
best well-balanced teams in the
‘collegiate circles. To ‘date they
have been toppled only once and
that was by N.Y.U. who boast
the country’s outstanding hill and
dale topper, MacMitchell. It’: a
veteran ball club that the local
barriers will bounce up agains
tomorrow. '

. In their meeting last year over
the Schenley course, the Panthers
subdued the boys from State Col-
lege. So the Olsonmen will have
to expect a close contest. The odds
will be against the local spikers
because the Nittany Lions will be
running on a familiar course. This
is a greatadvantage to hold over
an opponent.

Although the Hillanders took
one on the nose at the hands of

.Army last Saturday, Coach Olson
had one favorable remark to make
about the form displayed in the
meet. He said, “Curtis looked like
a champ against the Mules and
should hold his own against the
State team.”

The locals will set up camp just
outside of State College. They will
stay at Bellefonte until the start
of the meet Saturday afternoon.

According to reports, the meet
will start at 2:00, the same time
that the Penn State-Syracuse grid
encounter is scheduled to be run-
off. The State ofﬁcials plan to
close the meet in the stadium be-
tween halves.

However, both will be out to cap

Coach Olson plans to take seven

boys to the State affair. Bill Cur-

Davis, Miller and Bob Graham are.

certain starters for the Panther
cause, while the sixth and seventh
posts will be ﬁlled by trials to be
held between Allias, Saunders,
Carr and McGibbeney. '

Allias has been deposed from
the first five and his position was
ﬁlled in by Miller, another sopho-
more. This has been Miller's ﬁrs!’
taste of cross competition and he
is showing up well. In the trials
held last week he came in fifth and
looks like a real piece of timber
for the Pitt team.
