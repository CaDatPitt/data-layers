Fire investigators say they
haven’t yet determined the
cause of a fire that ripped
through an Oakland apartment
Monday, leaving at least seven
Pitt students homeless.

The fire erupted on the
third floor corner apartment at
513 Zulema St. before spread-

ing to 515 Zulema St., where
firefighters finally contained
it. Nobody was injured in the
blaze.

City fire investigators need
to talk to the occupant of the
third floor apartment before
making any determinations,
according to Pittsburgh
Assistant Fire Chief John
Gourley.

Gourley said investigators

have ruled out arson, and that
the blaze caused an estimated
$110,000 damage at 513
Zulema St.

“The apartments are com-
pletely uninhabitable,” he
said. “Those that weren’t dam-
aged by fire were damaged by
smoke and water.”

Residents of 515 Zulema
St. are still living in the build-

Tri-Delta hit with temorarysuspension

Hal Turner

Editor In chief
Pitt’s Delta Delta Delta Sorority

chapter has been slapped with an

temporary suspension‘ for throwing
a party where teenagers allegedly
got drunk, but the judge who urged
officials to revoke the sorority’s
charter said “they’d have been
decertified in 20 minutes” if the
outcome had been deadly.

Last Tuesday, Pittsburgh Judge
Daniel Butler issued a letter to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg call-
ing for the sorority’s decertifica-

tion, saying he was shocked by the
testimony of an 18-year-old woman
who said she got drunk at 21 Tri-
Delta “date party.” She said she and
her 19-year-old date took a taxi to
his dormitory where she testified he
sexually assaulted her.

If Tri-Delta broke University
drinking policy, Pitt should deliver
a punishment fitting the most
severe potential results of underage
drinking, not necessarily those that
occurred, Butler said.

“If they had driven drunk and
died in a car crash, I can guarantee
they [Tri-Delta] would have been

decertified in 203 minutes,” he said,
adding that he thinks decertification
is not excessive punishment.

Butler also said -he believes the
University investigation into’ alco-
hol policy violations stems from the
case’s publicity.

“That’s the only reason [Pitt is
investigating] -—- it’s a response to
press inquiry,” he said. 0

However, Pitt claims looking
into those violations could have
jeopardized the more important sex-
ual assault case before it went to
hearing May 15. Individuals might
be “less than cooperative” in the

sexual assault investigation if they
were being questioned about under-
age drinking, spokesman Ken
Service said.

Pitt Police have been working
on the sexual assault case since the

victim reported it on April 17,

Service said. Pitt’s Office of
Student Affairs didn’t begin its
underage-drinking investigation
until late May, however.
“Underage drinking was not
ignored. Once the [sexual assault]
hearing took place, that made it eas-
ier for the other investigation,”

Committee OKs
U-zone upgrade,
awaits board approval

Jason Gallinger

  

Assistant News Editor

Pitt’s trustees endorsed a proposal
Thursday to allow students to ride
Port Authority Transit buses any-
where in Allegheny County free of
charge.

The board’s Student Affairs
Committee Voted to increase stu-
dents’ security, safety and transporta-
tion fee to-$55 per semester for both
full- and part-time students.

Since 1997 the fee has been $37
per semester for
full-time and $16
per semester for
part-time students.

The increase
would take effect
at the beginning of
the fall 1998-99
semester.

If the full
board of trustees
votes in favor of
the plan at its June
25 meeting, stu-
dents would be
able to use their ID '
cards to ride Port
Authority buses
and light rail vehi-
cles anywhere in
Allegheny County.

Pitt would use
the increased secu-
rity, safety and
transportation fee
to pay PAT for the
service.

The plan. would not affect current
University shuttle service. However,
Pitt spokesman Ken Service cau-
tioned the proposal would be a
“demonstration project” for the first
year.

Service said the University could
adjust the plan for cost if the number
of riders turns out to be higher or
lower than current estimates. Other
factors might also arise, he said, as
the plan is utilized and Pitt identifies
unforeseen complications.

If cost or other factors indicate
the proposal is not feasible for the
long term, administration could abol-
ish it, Service said.

But he added “most people feel
pretty confident” the plan would work
out.

In April, students exercised a rare
opportunity to affect administrative
policy-making when the Department
of Parking and Transportation asked

He Said

* ‘ 3

them to vote on the proposal. More

' than 3,000 students voted in favor of

the plan. I
Following the student vote, the
Parking and Transportation

Committee — made up of representa-
tives of the Student Government
Board, Graduate and Professional

Student Association, Resident
Student Association and the
University Senate -- endorsed the

proposal, clearing the way for it to
proceed to the ‘Student Affairs;
Committee. “
The board of
trustees must next
endorse the plan. If
the board approves
the proposal, the
Department of
Parking and
Transportation will
finalize the arrange-
ments with PAT.
PAT’s board
of directors must
also approve the
proposal.
According to
Director of Parking
and Transportation
G. Robert Harkins,
the University hopes
to implement the
proposal by the fall
1998-99 semester.
Citing a need
to leave himself
room to negotiate
1- ‘ ~ with the Port
Authority, Harkins could not disclose
the tentative cost of the proposal.

However, past attempts to achieve
a similar agreement with PAT yielded
a figure in the range of $6 million per
year. Harkins said the offer new under
consideration is considerably lower.

Pitt’s administration initially con-
templated two alternative methods for
increasing the security, safety and
transportation fee.

The method administration chose
called for a ﬂat rate for both full- and
part-time students.

The other option was a $67 per
semester fee for full-time students
and a $31 per semester fee for part-
time students.

Service said the University chose
the ﬂat fee because it offers greater
equality.

“The feeling was that both full-
and part-time students will get the
same benefit regardless of the number
of courses they’re taking,” he said.

, Con artist costs
Pitt $400

Pitt invited Dr. Gavin Christopher, a
wealthy Boston doctor who promised to
donate $2 million during his visit to the
University, but instead got Jamal Smith
of Zaruba Street in Oakland.

Smith, who cost the University over
$400 in’ hotel, limousine and food bills,
posed first as the ﬁctitious doctor and
then as his son in an effort to scam the
University.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, he reportedly called the
Development Office several times and
promised a donation before, the
University fomially invited him to visit.

Posing as Dr. Christopher, Srriith

wthen contacted the University and
claimed to have contracted spinal

meningitis. He said he would send his
son, Jamal, to whom he had given
power of attorney, in his place.

When Smith arrived at Pitt on May
19 as Jamal Christopher, he claimed he
lost his luggage and his limousine driver
held him at gun point and stole his wal-
let.

Pitt paid for his room at the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association and
Smith used the University’s tab to buy
food, a long-sleeved T-shirt, a leather
portfolio and a quill pen. He also ran up
a $9 telephone bill and a bar tab.

University ofﬁcials took Smith
shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue, although
they refused to buy the $2,000 suit he
requested. 1

Smith also took a limousine tour of
Pittsburgh before Pitt oﬂicials became
suspicious and called Pitt police, who
confronted Smith at the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association. There he con-
fessed he had similarly scammed
Stanford University, Case Western
Reserve University, Morehouse College
and Wake Forest College.

Arternise Xyftis from the
Development Oﬁice refused to com-
ment on the situation.

Pitt student
accused.
of church arson

A Pitt student accused of arson ﬂed
the scene of the crime but left his blood
and ﬁngerprints behind.

Todd R. Davies, 26, of Prospect
Road, Prospect, turned himself in to FBI
agents in Pittsburgh Friday. A federal
grand jury indicted Davies the day
before on a charge he set ﬁre to the
Calvary Baptist Church in Jefferson
Township, Butler County, on March 12.

The blaze caused $1.5 million dam-
age to the church and an adjoining
school. Three fireﬁghters suffered
injuries battling the blaze.

After setting the ﬁre, Davies, whom

police say has no prior criminal record,
allegedly broke into a school bus parked
in the church lot. Police say he punched
a window with his bare fist, leaving
‘blood and fingerprints on the glass.

State police in Butler matched
blood and ﬁngerprints from the bus with
samples taken from Davies under a
court order. DNA tests of the blood are
pending.

According to Daniel Boeh, an
investigator for the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, Davies had been
a parisliioner of the church several years
ago. ‘

There has been no indication of
Davies’ motive. Boeh did say, however,
the arson was not a hate crime.

, Davies was arraigned in , U.S.
District Court on Friday and released on
$5,000 bond.

He will face federal charges in lieu
of local indictments, according to Butler
County District Attorney Timothy
McC1me.

Police have speculated a second
person was involved with the Butler
County ﬁre, although investigators have
refused to offer speciﬁc details of this
person’s identity or the details of the per-
son’s involvement.

The Calvary congregation plans to

rebuild the church. Since the ﬁre, ser_- A

vices have been held in the school gym-

nasium, which the ﬁre did not damage.
In recent months, southwestern
Pennsylvania has been the scene of ﬁve
other church arsons. Investigators have
not linked the ﬁre at Calvary Baptist
Church and Davies with those other

ﬁres. --

stench that pervades their dwelling.

Xavier Prine, who lives at 515
Zulema St., said he filed an insur-
ance claim because many of his
belongings were charred from the
smoke that billowed through his
next-door apartment. Firefighters
also chopped a hole in the ceiling of
his apartment to make sure the roof
wasn’t on fire, he said.

Prine said he signed a lease last
spring to rent an apartment at 513
Zulema St. in the fall, but isn’t sure
that will happen.

“The building is unlivable,” he
said. “The whole third floor was
gutted.” '

He said the building’s owner,
M.J. Kelly, told him they would
have to wait to hear from their

whether to try to repair the building
or level it and rebuild.

“Kelly said to sit tight to see
what happens with the building,”
Prine said. ,“We signed our lease and

our security deposit is in so we

would loose a whole month of rent
if we went somewhere else.’.’

Prine said Kelly told him he’d
help out however he could if they
couldn’t repair the apartment for
fall. Kelly, however, couldn’t be
reached for comment.

Newt's diplomacy needs
some serious iine-tuning

Well done, Newt Gingrich. Congratulations! You

deserve a medal for the outstanding display of diplo-
macy you’ve shown on your trip to the Middle East.

Seemingly determined "to make a fool of the ~

United States and undermine current negotiations

over Israel’s partial withdrawal from the Palestinian ’

West Bank, Gingrich accused the Palestinian
Authority of “systematically inciting violence among

' its followers.” .

He also said, “I think it’s wrong for the American
Secretary of State to become the agent for the
Palestinians.” , V

Though he did not visit the proposed site of a U.S.
embassy in Jerusalem, which would be a rubber-

9 stamp approval by the U.S. for Israel’s claim to the

city (Palestine wants the mostly-Muslim East
Jerusalem as its capital), he said Jerusalem should be
the symbolic capital of the Jewish state.

His comments prompted a walkout in the Israeli
Parliament by Palestinian representatives, and caused
several people in Washington to gape and wonder at
the length and breadth of the House Speaker’s stupid-
ity (not that this is the first time, though).

This- begs the question: Why the hell was
Gingrich, of all prominent American political ﬁgures,
sent as a diplomat into one of the world’s most
volatile negotiation processes? Was Louis Farrakhan
ill? Was Ralph Reed attending a convention? Sending
Gingrich to the Middle East makes about as much
sense as inviting the Marquis de Sade to a children’s
birthday party. -

Thankfully, Gingrich’s motor-mouth did not
cause too much damage, except to himself, by raising
a few giggles with his assertion that Palestinian nego-
tiators are incompetent. Yes, that’s right Newt
Gingrich, of all people, implied someone else is
incompetent.

Despite this aggressive pandering to the Israelis,
Israeli Defense Minister Yrtzhak Mordechai said on
Monday there was a general agreement over a “dou-
ble—digit” percentage withdrawal from the West
Bank, which he says will be lower than the 13 percent
suggested by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
and agreed on by the Palestinian Authority.

The State Departrnent’s James Rubin said with
the exception of the comments, Gingrich’s trip had
gone well.

Perhaps Rubin should’ve just told Gingrich to
shut up.

 

Card-buying: parental
discretion advised

Mother’s Day has since passed,
although I did have the opportunity to buy
a Mother’s Day card, lest mother cut off
the “expense account.”

I’ve always felt the act of guys buying
cards is like girls going to the bathroom -—
it must be done in a group. My group con-

. sisted only of my best friend, who was

nonetheless a supportive ﬁgure. (You

4 always need someone to tell you you’re in

the ‘To 40—Year-Old Jail_Mommy from
20-Something Son Fresh Out of the
Closet” section.) ‘

So with help on hand and a large mall
with an annoying amount of possibilities
before me, I checked to make sure I had,
at most, $5 on me. At least this way I
wouldn’t’ be tempted to buy Mom one of

“those useless pastel-colored ceramic trin-
kets that seem to populate many card
stores (perched on delicate glass shelves,
no less).

I used to take card-buying quite seri-
ously until I realized I was
giving cards to‘ ﬁiends, and I
saw the types of cards others
were giving to the same
friends. Buying cards used, to
belike ﬁndingadecentpairof
sneakers. The sneakers typically took

about a week and 10 stores to ﬁnd, and‘

even then I was only moderately happy.
But when I chose and bought a pair‘ of

’ sneakers in under 15 minutes, Iknew that

the card-buying wall would be the next to
crumble. ,
Despite this new-found attitude, I dis-
covered such expedience can’t always be
had. For instance, a dirty card won’t do, so
that entire section is out. Something com-
ical is always nice, so that serious business
— you know the ones with the deep pas-

sages on the front and on the inside —— is-

also out. The formula became simple: ﬁnd
store, ﬁnd humor, ﬁnd right time period
(it’s not Fatl1er’s Day yet) and look for the
cards with three colors and bold (but brief)
writing on the front.

I walked into the store pretending
there was only ﬁve minutes until close.
This mentality forces a quick, yet usually
decent card-buying decision. Since I used
to work retail, I understand what’s going
through the minds of the poor chaps
behind the counter:

“Darrin it, couldn’t they go some-
where else?! And why today? Mother’s
Day is still a damn month from now. I
hope they don’t knock over one of those
glass cases with all those useless pastel-
colored trinkets in them! Why don’t peo-
ple like those?”

I often wonder who designs some of
these wretched cards, with choice verse on

the front along the lines of: “Roses are red,
violets are blue,” and on the inside, “I’m
glad the police chose a mother for me like
you.” Another front/inside combination:
“The days are so bright, and the nights so
dark,” and, “and you being my mother is
like swimming with the shar .”

After picking the card, there is, of .

course, the moral question of picking the
envelope. "Ihat’s right, picking the enve-
lope. My former custom was to take the
envelope so conveniently provided behind

‘ the card This, however, is apparently out

of style. I was shown, by a friend on a pre-
vious card—searching excursion that it’s
actually OK to pick and choose the card’s
wardrobe as well. Gone were the days of
submitting to drab yellows or hideous

pinks. In are the present days of bright,

blues and crazy neons —— orange, yellow
and, gasp, chartreusel ‘

Try not to feel too restrained, although
the experienced, (like myself) try to put the
card into the envelope before
leaving the store. I was so
excited the ﬁrst time I didn’t
notice my card was choked by
my silly decision. My friend,
the recipient, understood,
although his moﬂier seemed baffled.

. I ﬁnally did ﬁnd something both
appropriate and funny, and elected a loud
and lovely ﬂoral jacket. Upon further
inspection of the store, I noticed these real-
ly large cards, the ones twice the size ofa
normal card. I began thinking: would it be
really silly to buy two cards and put them,
side by side, in one immense envelope? Is
this taboo? Not considering Mother’s Day,
but what about a birthday party for twins?
Or if your mother’s. birthday is May 5,
could you give her the two cards on May
10? I doubt I’ll have to deal with this. I
don’t know any twins that well and murn’s
birthday is in the middle of January. (I sup-

pose a combination of birthday and

Inauguration Day cards could be opted
for.)

Moﬂier usually enjoys the cards I give
her (with the written promise of a hug and
a kiss every day for a month in lieu of a
gift), this one being no exception. 'I‘hey’re
read once then put away with all the other
colorful cards and even more colorful
envelopes. This year’s says on the ﬁont:
“On this wonderful holiday for you,
Mother, in May,” and on the inside, “your
son hopes you don’t mind him wasting his
years at college away.”

If nothing else, she can use the enve-

lope for wrapping paper.

Food preparation a misunderstood art

Heather Barnett
columnist
I’m not exactly a June Cleaver

. wannabe. I couldn’t care less about how

Snuggle-soft my towels are, and as for the
carpet — well, I, like nature, abhor a vacu-
um.

I have exactly one arguably domestic
talent I can cook

The art: of preparing food is one of the
most misunderstood, ranking somewhere on
the scale between abstract expressionism
and interpretive dance involving blue—paint—
ed nudes and Silly String. People think of
cooking as a pastime for the mild-rnannered,
the mother hen, yes, the woman.

This is, need you ask, bull. First off, do
you know how many of the world’s master
chefs are women? Neither do I, but it’s a
small number, I know that Professional

I kitchens are famously stressful workplaces,

and are slightly less likely to become truly
non—sexist environments than the Aberdeen

 ‘ Proving Ground

But what about devoted amateurs like
me, the people who spend hours of their free
time trying to perfect their lemon souﬂle, the
people who consult “The New York Times
Cookbook” far more frequently than any of
the inspired texts of the world’s major reli-

gions? What drives us?

Cooking feeds animal urges beyond the

most obvious — hunger. It provides an out-
let for basic human emotions. It allows you
to be completely civilized on the outside
while providing a pressure valve for socially
unacceptable impulses. e ,

One of the great things many peo- ,_
ple don’t realize about cook- //
ing is how aggressive it real- »,
ly is. Chopping. Pounding. 
Kneading. Whipping. Better 
to sink a knife into a
mushroom, I I
say, than
i n t o a
your
neigh-
b o r . 
(Unless, of
course, your
upstairs neighbor
is getting jiggy
with it at 3 am, in
which case no jury in
the world will \hold you
responsible.)

For the homicidal maniac in you, try
cooking lobster. You plunge them into boil-
ing water and try to convince yourself
they’re just clattering around in that pan

because of an automatic neuromuscular
reaction. Then you drown your sorrows in
drawn butter.

Cooking is also great for control freaks.
Except for stuff like Christmas cookies,
foods are generally most easily prepared by
one person. This means no sharing of
authority, no passing the buck, for the fate of
the world.

I’m calming down now. Really.

Cooking takes a certain amount of guts
and endurance, though. You have to be
ready to think and act quickly. It’s a
t metaphor for life. Hey, my man Hany

- Truman said it —— “If you can’t
stand the heat, get out of the
kitchen.”
The thing about cooks
you have to realize is we’re
obsessive because we have a
se1f—feeding addiction. We
make good food, we start to
expect good food, we get to the
V point where nothing is acceptable
but the best.

You exhibit certain symptoms when
you start to become a foodie. (I hate that
word, but at least it sounds less pretentious
than “gourme ’ or “epicure.”) You start to do
things like packing a lunch not because
you’re broke but because you can’t ﬁnd a

decent green salad in Oakland You can no
longer eat margarine because it has an effect
on your palate like licking the ﬂoor in a
petroleum—based fertilizer factory. You start
referring to your favorite cookbook authors
by ﬁrst name: Craig, Julia, Irma. (Claiborne,
Child and Rombauer. You hate the new edi-
tion of “The Joy of Cooking.” By the way,
like New Coke, it just ain’t the real thing.)

Cooking is a big component of inde-
pendence. If you can’t do really simple
things — cooking frozen vegetables, for
instance, or frying an egg — you will always
be beholden either to someone else to cook
for you or to prepackaged food. Do you real-
ly want to spend your entire life existing on
Ramen noodles and Stouffer’s French bread
pizza?

Moreover, being able to make your own
food lets you manifest your individuality.
You don’t like nuts in sweet rolls? Don’t use
them. Want pizza with sliced grapefruit and
guacamole? Then you’re a strange little
duck, but go for it anyway.

Food is like a lot ofthings in life — it’s
not so much what you’re given, but instead
what you do with it. And it deserves to be
savored instead of just gotten over with.

Heather Barnett believes that Marshmallow
Fluﬁ" is one of nature 3* perfect foods.

  Draconian

J. Michael

Murray

Recently in San Francisco, U.S.
District court judge Charles Breyer ordered
six medical marijuana clubs to be closed for
violation of the Controlled Substance Act.
The clubs provide marijuana to individuals
suffering from theside effects of AIDS and
cancer treatments, as well as to persons
afflicted by disorders such as multiple scle-
rosis and muscular dystrophy. The club
owners pledge to keep the clubs open until
they have their day in court.

These are the men and women whose
sutferings are both neglected and prolonged
by an often questioned, half- century—old
political agenda, laid out by none other than
the United States most corrupt public oﬂi—
cial to date, J. Edgar Hoover. This is the man
who denied the existence of any organized
crime in his decades as director of the FBI.

(Also, the proﬁts from the sale of mari-
juana and other illegal substances do not
end up in the pockets of small time dealers
and growers, but in the pockets of the drug
cartel barons. These individuals are not the
inmates in our federal and state prisons.
They are far enough away from local dis-
tributors to avoid prosecution.

As our prisons ﬁll with non—violent
marijuana oﬂenders to levels that exceed
the per capita rate of any other democratic
nation, one must begin to ask if our federal
govermnent’s methods in curbing drug use

marijuana laws infringe on rights

are excessive or even eﬂ’ective. There are
twice as many teenage marijuana users
today as there were in 1990, just about ﬁf-
teen years after the “Just Say No” campaign
began. Aren’t our children the ones we
believed we’d be saving by subscribing to
this anti-drug propaganda and “war on
drugs”?

War uniﬁes support for a weak admin-
istration, it diverts money from the citizens’
pockets, and it gives constitutional cause to
infringe on citizens’ privacy and personal
liberties. The red threat, now gone, has left
the American war machine without a target.
The funds are now allocated to break down
the barrier set by our forefathers to prevent
our country falling into a fascist state: the
Bill of Rights. Our liberties are trashed with
each penny spent to spy on, manipulate and
incarcerate citizens who choose to ignite a
joint after a hard day’s work or, God forbid,
try to lessen slightly the painful effects of
chemotherapy. '

The World Health Organization recent-
ly released a report on the global effects of
marijuana. It found that the use of marijua-
na worldwide had insigniﬁcant negative
effects on health and social welfare, espe-
cially when compared with the use of nico-
tine and alcohol. The report went on to say
that even if marijuana use were to increase
to the levels of these other two drugs, their
ﬁnding would most likely be the same. The
report’s release was delayed for several
months due to pressure from, who else, the

United States government. The U.S. gov-
ernment has also been instrumental in
delaying medical marijuana legalization in
Canada, Great Britain, France and
Germany. All fear the political and econom-
ic sanctions promised by U.S. policy-mak-
ers for narcotics decriminalization. Our
diplomats have even strongly discouraged
foreign doctors and scientists from
researching the possible beneﬁts of marijua-
na.

Most marijuana addicts reported by the
government are usually people who have
chosen to go into treatment to avoid or
lessen their prison sentences, although mar-
ijuana addiction is somewhat of a myth any-
way. There is no chemical addiction like
that of nicotine, heroin and even alcohol. An
addict of any one of these substances shows
serious withdrawal symptoms, while mari-
juana users seem to be able to walk away
from the drug without serious conse-
quences. The greatest danger to marijuana
users comes not from the drug itself, but
from the law— enforcement officials wh
hunt them down like dogs. -

Anyone who has experimented with
marijuana will generally say that although
there may be better ways to spend your time
and money, it is quite harmless. Abuse and
overuse of any substance can be detrimental
to your health. Eat too much and you get fat.
Drink too much alcohol and problems
ensue, though even the use of alcohol in
moderation has been found to lessen your

chances of heart disease. Let’s get drug
addicts out of prison and into treatment, and
let responsible adults make ﬂieir own deci-
sions about the use of recreational drugs.
There are more drugs in any one prison than
Hunter S. Thompson and Trmotlry Leary
have seen in ﬂieir whole lives. It costs more
toputadrugdealerinprisonthantoputhim
into treatment, and treatment is twice as
likely to keep him from’ using, and therefore
selling.

Science doesn’t lie, politicians do. A
recent CBS poll found that 70 percent of
Americans favor decriminalization of med-
ical marijuana, considering its obvious ben-
eﬁts in medicine. There is, however, little
support on Capitol Hill.

Write to your congressman, senator
and president. Join NORML. Attend rallies
and smoke-outs. You don’t have to use mar-
ijuana to realize there is a great evil bearing
‘down on everyone’s rights and liberties. It
must be stopped — ﬁrst with the legaliza-
tion of marijuana for medical purposes.

That is the torch Lady Liberty carries
today, but our current government is trying
every form of propaganda to keep us in the
dark. If the torch is extinguished, we lose
the very essence of the American way of
freedom. 0

Special eats

over

By JAKE WOMER

I want Godzookie, the ridiculous cartoon rnini-
Godzilla with a squeaky voice and wings. He only
called the big guy when there were major problems.
Well, he should be screaming now. The problem is
Godzilla looks like a chump.

Sony spent $120 million on the new special-
effects laden Godzilla. The ﬁlm has been marketed
for the better part of a year with the tag line ”SIZE
DOES MATTER” They even showed Godzilla’s
mammoth foot crushing the remains of a T-rex.
They ﬁgured it was a shoe-in to break the Memorial
Day weekend box office record of over $90 million,
held by Iurassic Park: The Lost World. But early
reports show the lizard well behind the the
dinosaurs’ record. Hmmm. Maybe size doesn't mat-
ter so much.

Digital effects have enhanced ﬁlms in the past
and will again this summer, but Godzilla will not
enter any esteemed pantheon. iWhile ﬁlmmakers
Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the creators of
Independence Day, used numerous computer-gener-
ated effects, they forgot about adding suspense to
the story. It takes talent to strip all of the suspense
from the scene of a rampaging beast killing thou-
sands. But they succeeded. Godzilla is more worried
about nesting in Manhattan and feeding his young
with ﬁsh. I don't want to sympathize with Godzilla.
Come on, the tame lizard doesn't even eat anybody
or breathe ﬁre. He just runs and swims. The may-
hem is dull, and only the army is in danger because
the city was evacuated.

In The Lost World, the dinosaurs actually eat peo-
ple. Now that’ s something to cause a little tension
and suspense. Steven Spielberg offers poachers up
for food, and even a few of the good guys ——that’ s
entertainment. ]eff Goldblum’s character even adds
good cheesy humor to depreciate the film's realism.

That’ s one way Devlin and Emmerich could

 

paltry plots

have gone
—— a cele-
bration of
cheese. A

in a
rubber suit  * -
would be a bit much, but the sight of Godzilla’s dark
disproportioned body is funny only because the
ﬁlmmakers don't seem to be in on the joke of their
creation. He looks ﬁerce, but he's just a scared
puppy. The cheese could have been raised to points
of utter side-splitting hilarity by the likes of Tim
Burton of Beetlejuice fame, but these guys don't seem
to have the vision to see beyond the ﬂashiness of the
effects.

In one scene, the actors run through a corridor of
snapping baby ’zillas. The creatures were obviously
added later because the acting is completely out of
sync with the effects. The actors don't even have a
chance at realism as they pretend to fear dozens of
biting beasts. Somehow, all of the actors survive. It’ s
cheesy as hell, but the ﬁlmmakers don't seem ready
to admit it.

They obviously think the special effects
and multi-million dollar marketing are enough to
sell the ﬁlm without a good plot.

From executive producer Spielberg, Deep Impact,
the other sci-ﬁ ﬂick now in theaters, shows ﬂashes of

and Emmerich use them to support nearly every
scene of their ﬁlm.

Fortunately, the number of special—effects ﬁlled
films has dwindled since last summer. The X—ﬁles
will likely have a few digital effects with their big-
screen budget. And director Terry Gilliam uses spe-
cial effects with a careful eye toward drug-induced
hallucinations in Pear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
Armageddon is the other big special effects movie this
summer. The latter comet movie ex lores more of
an outer space attempt to destroy tllfe comet, with
meteor showers pouring down on the planet.
Hopefully, if we have to watch another comet movie
the apocalypse will come. That would make for
some cool effects, but producer Jerry Bruckheirner is
known for letting the good guys win against all
odds. And the unbeatable action ﬁgure Bruce Willis
is the star. It doesn't look good for the comet, but
with any luck, Armageddon will be the last all-con-
surning digital effects movie until the next install-
ment of Star Wars —— the franchise that started digi-
tal hysteria.

self-awareness that Godzilla so desperately
needs. Digital effects only get about 15 minutes
of screen time. The rest of the time is spent
preparing for imminent doom or trying to avoid
it in a ﬁght for survival. The effects are a huge
comet and a mountainous tidal wave. They are
both realistic enough that I could picture col-
lapsing in fear at the sight of either one, but I
would just go into convulsions of laughter while
watching Godzilla lay an egg.

Director Mimi Leder uses digital effects as a
tool to enhance the spell of the ﬁlm, but Devlin

Just in case you’re not a fan and
you’re interested in becoming one,
think of Sonic Youth as Nirvana with a
real twist of lime. Only Nirvana was
better.

Now, although not a royal true—blue
Sonic Youth fan, I’m trying to be open-
minded; but sometimes being open-
minded does not pay off. 
Sonic Youth’s music has
been described as “teen-age
distortion,” and I whole-
heartedly agree. Their music
has a tendency to sound as 
though it was put together at the last
minute. The raw, unreﬁned approach
does not work for Sonic Youth this
time. ’

Their latest release, A Thousand
Leaves, is a mix of the two albums G00
and Dirty. If you’re a loyal fan, you
should feel right at home. And if you
are a loyal fan who has followed them
for the past 16 years, then you probably
know all about their style and what
makes them tick. So what the hell is
with all the weird noises they use in
their albums? They sounds more like

your dad working in the wood sho

than a rhythmic groove. ‘

 

  

 

I realize their music is not for
everyone. But now that I probably have
every single Sonic Youth fan ready to
egg my house, the CD is not all bad.
Look for the previously released track
“Sunday” with its mellow guitar riffs
and steady beat on MTV and radio sta-
tions soon. Also, “Hits of Sunshine (for
Allen Ginsburg)” and “Karen Koltrane”

are incredibly engrossing and enjoyable

to boot. But don’t expect to
find the latter two tracks on
the air waves anytime soon
because both are exception-
ally long songs, each
, exceeding nine minutes.
That means if you’re a die—hard fan, run
and plop down your money at the local
record store for the album. You will
enjoy it, but everybody else should just
borrow the CD. On a side note, for all
you intense listeners,’ the band is
announcing a US tour. Fortunately,
they’re not stopping in hum-drum
Pittsburgh, but they will be dropping in
on Philadelphia at the Electric Factory
in early June as well as New York, so
watch out for them. Finally,
Pittsburgh’s’ backwards conservatism
works in our favor because I’d rather
slit my wrists than listen to these songs
performed live. ’ I

Michael Glabicki, lead guitarist of
local—turned—national act Rusted Root, will
return to his roots this June 2 to play a ben-
efit show for the Allegheny National
Forest.

“For the Allegheny” is a grass—roots
appeal to preserve the Allegheny National
Forest by vocalizing local support for the
new national bill, HR 2789, the
National Forest Protection and
Restoration Act. This bill primarily
aims to end logging on federal public
lands, such as the Allegheny Forest.

Glabicki is maintaining his rela-
tionship with the band while devel-
oping new material for a solo album
he’ll record later this year.

The recording of his solo album
will coincide with the release of
Rusted Root’s new CD. Rusted Root has
grown into a platinum recording act over
the past five years, touring with acts like
Page and Plant, The Dave Matthews Band,
The Grateful Dead and Sheryl Crow.

His wife, Smokelin, will open the all-
ages event. She is an enticing songstress
who weaves colorful poetry into a seduc-
tive aura of trance and spunk. She has been
performing since 1994 at local and region-
al venues.

 

 

The Middle Eastern dance troupe
Ghawazee will perform also throughout the
night. Formed in late 1995, the 1l—member
dance group was conceived as a forum for
Middle Eastern dance and music to display
and educate audiences as well as entertain
them.

Promoters of “For the Allegheny” hope
the concert will bring issues bill HR 2789
addresses into the local political spotlight.
In addition, a letter—writ—
ing campaign will be
organized at the show.

“Through the spirit
of music, we will
inspire, ' inform and
empower interested peo-
ple to come together and
take action. Right in the
backyard of Pittsburgh is
the potential for one of
the world’s most beautiful forests,” said
Glabicki in a press release, “and as of now,
if we don’t do something, it will be turned

It just seems Glabicki’s entrancing
tunes would be better served by the tall
pines of the forest or another outdoor venue
rather than the long tap handles and wood-
en tables at Rosebud.

S|ers' cuts

are coming.
Who should go?

All right Steeler fans, look at
your calendar. It’s May 27. Five more
days until you’ll see some major
changes to the face of your football
team.

“June 1 marks the first day of the
second wave of free agency. It’s the
day that NFL teams can cut players
without their 1998 salaries counting
against the coming year’s salary cap.

And fora team like the Steelers, V
who right now don’t have enough
salary cap room to breathe, next
Monday will be like Christmas in
June.

Cutting players can actually be a
good thing for a team because many
throw tons of money at old, marginal-
ly talented free agents.

At the‘ time of the signings, these

4 moves seemed strategic and essential

to ﬁll gaping holes in the lineup. But
a couple of years later when you have
a 30-something ﬂop making $2 mil-
lion sitting on your bench, you can’t
wait to get rid of him. So the teams
wait until June 1, cut him and use that
money to sign someone else, usually
at a bargain price.

Now the Steelers have never
fallen into the game of overpaying
players. They are probably smarter
with their money than any team in the
league, and they have never been
caught up in wild spending sprees.
Instead they’ve concentrated on re-
signing their own stars, building
through the draft and trying to devel-
op a well-rounded team, instead of
overpaying three or four stars and
having the rest of the roster ﬁlled with
bums (like dem Cowboys).

But right now, the Steelers have
a couple of major holes to ﬁll and a
couple of expendable players soaking
up some substantial cash.

Washed-up cornerback Donell
Wolford should be a sure goner. Last
year he proved he couldn’t cover a
piece of bread with peanut butter, and
the team can save about a million dol-
lars by cutting him next week.

Former All-Pro Greg Lloyd. is
the other player that the Steelers
would be smart to let go.

I’m not saying Lloyd can’t play
the game at all anymore, but he can’t
play it the level of making $3 million
a year. At one time he was the best
outside linebacker in the league, but

6.24 meters. This was her sec- 
ond jump this season which qual- .
iﬁed her to compete in the
NCAA National Championship next
week in Buffalo, N.Y.

Smith added a win in the triple
jump with a jump of just under 44 feet,
which also qualiﬁed her for the NCAA
meet June 3-6.

"Trecia had an awesome weekend,”
Head Coach Steve Lewis said. '

jumping t nation

Smith's national championship long

NBA heuclsinie Ihe end of life‘

playoffs with three teams Iefl

Joe Carmody
For The Pltt News

Now that the NBA playoffs are
in full swing, it's time for the world
to see superstars’ like Michael
Jordan, Karl Malone and Reggie
Miller show their stuff.

This past weekend displayed
what the game of basketball is all
about .

The Utah Jazz, who swept the

a Los Angeles Lakers in four straight

games, showed that hard work and
commitment to a team's philosophy
are how to strive toward a champi-
onship ring.

The Chicago Bulls and Indiana
Pacers, who are tied at two games
apiece in their best of seven Eastern
Conference Finals series, demon-
strated the importance of reserve
players, free-throw shooting and
pressure defense in determining the
outcome of the game.

Although the heroics of the
league's superstars make or break
their teams’ chances, it's the little
things in the sport of basketball that

V put Michael or Reggie in the posi-

tion to create the big play which

I makes the game as exciting as it is.

 
 

The league's reputation has
been in question all season long, so
the drama and excitement of the
playoffs are a relief to those who
share the same love of the game as
the members of the Jazz, Bulls and
Pacers.

The list of
problems within
the league is end-
less: salaries, '
selfish attitudes,
sneaker compa-
nies, super agents,

coaching staffs and mature players.

These teams take the game to a
new level by increasing their com-
petitiveness and emotions, not their
vertical leaps and sharp tongues.

But don't suspect anything but
aggressive play in
the remaining
games.

The Bulls and
Pacers are current-
ly at war with each
other. Tempers
have ﬂared; partic-

television con— ularly during
tracts, Marv Memorial Dayfs
Albert, Latrell game four.

Sprewell, crime, There was

drug and alcohol
abuse and disloy-
alty to the fans.
The drama
that has unfolded
between these
three remaining
teams has done a
great deal to shift the attention of
fans back to the court and away
from the front office, which really
is not that important to the sport.
The Jazz, Bulls and Pacers are

The Jazz, on the other hand,
showed no sign of satisfaction after
sweeping the young and talented
team from Los Angeles.

close games, and they won't settle
for anything but a world champi-
onship of their own.

Karl Malone said to a USA
Today sports reporter after Sunday's
victory in Inglewood, California,
"We took care of business, but our
job isn't done yet. There is no swag-
ger in this team. We go out and play
the game. We just take care of busi-
ness."

It's this type of attitude that
makes. Malone the player he is.
Both Jordan and Miller are just as
focused, along with everybody else
involved in these world class orga-
nizations and playing in these very
exciting playoffs.

These players set an example
that everyone in the world of bas-
ketball and in the world in general
should follow, and hopefully
Michael, Karl and Reggie's commit-
ment to the game and desire to suc-

ceed will spread both on and off the ‘

court.

So every player, coach, fan or
newcomer to the greatest game on
earth, catch the action Wednesday
night in Chicago at 9 p.m. on NBC
and see why the real pros are still
on the court.

there’s just no room for an old line-
backer with a bad knee making that
kind of money on a Superbowl con-
tending team that has other holes to ﬁll.

For one thing, the Steelers are
knee—deep in linebackers. They have
two of the league’s best on the inside
with Levon Kirkland and Earl Holmes.

At outside linebacker, they recent-
ly signed Jason Gildon to a long-term
deal, and young studs Mike Vrabel and
Steve Conley could become stars.

The Steelers also need money to
sign their draft picks. Alan Faneca,
Jeremy Staat and company are going to
be impact players, and the Steelers need
to get them in camp as soon as possible.

The team has signed one draft pick
and has 11 more to go and no money
with which to sign them.

But the area where their biggest
hole exists is in the defensive backﬁeld.
The team thought they had that position
taken care of when they signed Dwayne
Washington to start at the comerback
spot opposite of last year’s number one
pick Chad Scott.

But Scott tore his anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee two weeks
ago and will be out for the entire year.
That leaves.a gaping hole in the sec-
ondary; comerback is probably the

mom PAGE 12 L

absolute last spot you want to have a
hole on the defensive side of the ball.

Right now the Steelers have a cou-
ple joumeymen and rookies on the ros-
ter, but if players like that start, any
capable team will exploit that weakness
on a regular basis.

The team could move Carnell
Lake to comerback again, but while he
is a solid comerback, he is the league’s
best safety, and the Steelers want to
keep him there if possible.

After Monday, a handful of ade-
quate comerbacks should become
available when they get cut from other
teams. They’re guys who might not be
worth $2 or $3 million to the team
that’s cutting them, but would be a bar-
gain to the Steelers at $500,000 or so.

Similarly, Greg Lloyd might not
be worth the $3 million the Steelers are
paying him, but he might be a bargain
at a cheaper price to another team with

‘a hole at linebacker.

Cutting Lloyd isn’t just giving
away a former All-Pro; it’s a more efﬁ—

’ cient use of money in areas that can

help the team win more games next
year.

Brian Knavish is the Assistant
Sports Editor at The Pitt News and
would love to be cut by the Steelers
after an All-Pro season and a knee

injury.

enough for her to qualify for the NCAA
National Championship meet next
weekend as well. _

She came back less than an hour
later to run in the relay. Dorin set her
personal best time in the relay to go
along with the great performances of
the other three runners. "

“That time will be one of the top
three times in the world this year,”
Lewis said.

On the mens' team, the 4x400 relay
team placed fourth. Gregg Blake,
Sekou Dilday, Carl Taylor and Jeremy
Ward qualified forthe ﬁnals with a time
of 3:09:06. Dilday placed sixth in the
400—meter race, which also qualiﬁe
him for the ﬁnals. '

“Considering the youth that we
have and the people who scored who
were all underclassmen, I am super-

happy and elated,” Lewis said. A
Also, Jack Jeffreys fared well last
weekend by ﬁnishing fourth in the 110-
meter hurdles with a time of 14.31 sec-
onds in the ﬁnals.
“The only thing our runners are
lacking against these 23, 24, 25-year-

olds is experience,” Lewis said.

Smith racked up a 14th place ﬁnish
in the javelin and a fourth in the shotput
with a throw of 45 feet, 2.14 inches.

Joetta Purter ﬁnished sixth in the
400—meter intermediate hurdles. All of
these womens' scores added up to a
fourth place finish for the Lady
Panthers. George Mason won the
Championship, with Seton Hall ﬁnish-
ing second and West Virginia ﬁnishing
third. .

The biggest surprise of the week-
end was Tasha Peart, according to
Lewis. The freshman ﬁnished eighth in
the 400-meters, running 54.35 seconds
in the trials.
