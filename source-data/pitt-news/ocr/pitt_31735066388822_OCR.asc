Heyward
pleads

guilty
in court

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

Craig "lronhead” Heyward
pleaded guilty to disorderly con-
duct yesterday in a magistrate
court and was ordered by Judge
Joan Melvin to perform 50 hours
of community service work.

Melvin also ordered Heyward
to pay $150 of restitution to the
Pitt police officer whose glasses
were broken during the Jan. 10
incident.

The incident occured during a
shooting in the William Pitt Un-
ion. The campus police claimed
that Heyward refused to leave the
scene of the shooting. Heyward
insisted that he was simply trying
to find out what had happened
when a policewoman started
poking him with a nightstick.

The other charges of simple as-
sault and resisting arrest were
dropped through a plea-
bargaining arrangement.

’’It was handled like any other
case,” said Ray Radakovich, Hey-
ward’s lawyer, in an interview
with the Associated Press. ”He
[Heyward] received the same
treatment that anyone else would
have received at a magistrate
court, and that's all we wanted.
It was fair. Rather than dragging

Pitt students wanted their
basketball TV, and they final-
ly got it —— or at least the next
best thing.

The demand for Pitt-
Syracuse basketball tickets has
prompted the athletic office,
operating in conjunction with
the Pitt Program Council, to air
the game to Pitt students on
closed-circuit television in the
Fitzgerald Field House.

A major controversy arose
when,Pitt Athletic Director Ed
Bozik decided to black out
Wednesday's game for the
second year in a row in Pitts-
burgh and surrounding areas.

Assistant Director of Student
Activities Tom Misuraca said
there was a ”perceived need
from the students.” He also
said, ”The Athletic Depart-
ment and the PPC had similar
ideas, so we were able to work

Craig Heyward had his day in court yesterday and came away with a court sentence of 50 hours of community

service work and a small fine.

it out any more, we just thought
it was best to get it over with.”

Radakovich said Heyward
would have preferred to have
paid a fine because of plans to
leave town. Heyward said that
the community service isn't a
problem, though. ”Whatever the
work is,” said Heyward, ’’I’m
willing to do it, just to get the 50
hours out of the way.”

Heyward has until May 15 to
perform the community work, or
he will serve a 30-day jail
sentence.

This is Heyward’s third arrest

it in the Field House."

The closed-circuit broadcast
will be open to any Pitt stu-
dent having a valid student
ID,’’ Misuraca said. ”The stu-
dents are behind the team, so
we should make every effort
[to allow them to view the
game].” -

According to Bozik, the de-
cision to black out the game
stems from a need to ”main—
tain a demand for tickets.”

He added that the approxi-
mate 2,000 tickets Pitt makes
available is proportionally
larger than any other Big East
college as well. ”No other Big
East team gives free tickets to
its students,” he said.

Bozik said that 16 out of the
27 games this year were
scheduled to be televised, in-
cluding six at home, and that
with the possibilities of the Big
East and NCAA tournaments,
an estimated 21 games may be
shown.

A large group of students

during his tenure at Pitt. ln Janu-
ary of 1985, he was arrested by
campus police and charged with
aggravated and simple assault for
striking another Pitt student in the
face with a crutch. He was later
sentenced to a one-year proba-
tion period and was ruled ineligi-
ble to play in the 1985 football
season.

In March of 1986, he was
charged and fined for simple as-
sault and harassment of a
12-year-old paperboy.

Heyward, who has decided not
to return to play for Pitt in the

have stated they believe the
blackout is unnecessary and
even harmful to the basketball
team. And although this Pitt-
Syracuse game will be played
in the Civic Arena, the same
amount of tickets (2,000) were
issued.

Pitt student Ron Kyslinger
said he was so angry about Bo-
zik’s decision that he called to
inform WTAE that he had or-
ganized a group of students to
rally at the William Pitt Union
in an effort to gain support for
their attempt to have the pro-
gram televised.

’’I heard Ed Bozik was plan-
ning to black out the game, so
1 called him. After talking to
him, it got me upset that he
didn't have any sympathy for
the students. Then I talked to
a few friends and decided to
start up the petition Thursday
night,” said Kyslinger, a
junior.

1988 football season and will pe-
tition the NFL to be allowed to
enter a supplemental draft, said
he had no regrets coming to Pitt.

‘'1 had a great time here,” said
Heyward. ’’If I had to do it all
over again, I would still come
back to the University of Pitts-
burgh, but I'd do it in a different
way.”

After the trial, Heyward said he
planned to go home for a few
days. ”|'ll'be with people who
understand the real Craig Hey-
ward — people who I grew up
with and that I can have a lot

more fun with,” he said.

Rushing for more than 1,600
yards this year, Heyward leaves
as the second—leading rusher in
Pitt history, behind only Tony
Dorsett. He is only the eighth
NCAA Division 1 player to rush
for more than 100 yards in each
of his team's regular-season
games. He finished fifth in the
Heisman voting.

”Who is the real Craig Hey-
ward?” asked the star running
back. ”He’s the happy-go-lucky,

C/\/I U students protest
military use of SE]

By Mark Brown
Staff Writer

Local demonstrators gathered
in front of Carnegie Mellon
University's Software Engineering
Institute yesterday morning to
protest a closed meeting of the
board of trustees, which was be-
ing held inside the SEI building.

Ross Kronenbitter, a protestor
from a group called a Brighter Fu-
ture, stated: ”The fact that they're
having a closed trustee meeting
is unusual. CMU is becoming
more military than educational.
 It's a sign of stupidity that CMU
is pandering to the military.”

Protest signs read ”Divest
[From] War,” ”Stop CMU Sub-
mission to Military Industrial Per-
suasion” and ’’Closed Trustee
Meeting —- No Voice for Hu-
manity”.

Pitt graduate Mary Hanlon, a
protester, said, ” A girlfriend of

mine had a baby last night, which
reinforces my desire for life to
continue on this planet. The
money and the brains here could
be used to feed people instead of
killing them.” Pointing to the SE1

building, she added, ”This is‘

ridiculous.”

A group calling themselves
Peace TV was on hand to film the
protest and will show the footage
on Monday at 2 p.m. on channel
21, public access community tel-
evision.

Patti Heckart, of Peace TV,
said, ”We’re here to use the me-
dia to show images of people
working for progressive social
change, instead of racism, sex-
ism, violence and commer-
cialism.”

”The board of trustee meetings
are always closed. That's policy,”
said CMU's public relations Vice
President Don Hale. "We are not

Contras nix peace process; time to raise funds

MIAMI - ("ontra leaders an-
nounced Monday they will delay
peace talks with Nicaragua’s San-
dinista government in the wake
of congressional rejection of their
aid package.

(fontra director Alfredo Cesar
said neither the rebels nor Roman
(‘atliolic (‘hurch leaders mediat-
ing the negotiations would be
able to attend a meeting sched-
uled for Wednesday in
(iuatemala.

The delay will be for only ”a
few days or a couple of weeks,”
said Cesar, who said that Wed-
nesday's meeting date had been
tentative in any case.

The Contra leadership also an-
nounced a formal fund—raising
drive that has already received
$5()() from presidential candidate
Sen. Bob [)ole, R-Kan., and $400
from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

But Director Adolfo Calero said
”private funds can never replace
the aid” turned down by

The money raised in the Unit-

weapons elsewhere.

”We will go to third iountries
and people living outside the
United States” for funds to buy
weapons, said Calero, but added
that no other nations have yet
been approached.

The leaders said all contribu-
tions will be funneled through

a.m. Tuesday. The governor, a
Democrat in his second year in
office, has already said he plans
no tax increases or decreases.

Robert Urotevant, Casey’.s
spokesman, said the speech itself
will represent a departure from
past practice, in which governors
listed how many millions would
be earmarked for specific
programs.

”The governor's speech is go-
ing to be thematic: and not a
dollar-for-dollar laundry list. This
really is the year that people will
begin to .see Robert P. Casey in
terms of where he wants to lead
the state,” Cirotevant said.

Pittsburgh's elnergency system

a woman was raped after police,

home for a burglar and then left.
While the officers searched, the

Ronald Taylor said his mother,

Robert Kennedy, chief of Emer-

”There was certainly a problem

”We can't say the woman would

Council discusses 911 problems Blackout

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Council is hold-
ing a special session today at 10
a.m. to discuss the recent
problems with the “'91 1" system
and the mayor's service line
(255-INFO).

Recently, City Council disco-
vered that 91 1 operators were an-
swering calls from the service
line, which was originally estab-
lished to ensure that the 911 lines
weren't congested with non-
emergency calls.

’’I am surprised that anyone
would want to take credit for the
idea [the mayor's service line],”

   

      

said Michael Leonard, a night-
time supervisor of the 911
operators.

Councilwoman Michelle
Madoff, who sponsored the bill
that set up the service number last
December, said, ”They [the Pub-
lic Safety Department],didn’t tell
me after the fact that emergency
operators were going to have to
answer the calls.”

Public Safety Chairman Jack
Wagner said that Madoff was
briefed by the public safety direc-
tor and the assistant public safe-
ty director on how the line would
be operated.

According to Wagner, one half
of the 700,000 calls that the 91 1
lines handled last year were for

The fact that the trustee's meet-
ing is being held in the SE1 build-
ing has nothing to do with
making any decisions necessari-

the service line. He called for the
immediate termination of the line
and accused Madoff of using the
line for political purposes.

Madoff then accused Wagner
of taking a ”cheap shot” at her
over the issue. She said that
Wagner was in favor of the line
when she introduced it.

"I can't believe that they're
ganging up on me on my own
bill. This whole mess will be
straightened out by Thursday,”
said Madoff.

Madoff said the public safety
director told her that an anwering
machine is going to be installed
on the line.

The public safety director could
not be reached for comment

According to Kyslinger, ’’I

I was told I would be hearing
from them the following day. It
wasn't even 15 minutes later that
we heard he [Bill Hillgrove, a
sportscaster with the station] was
more than interested in doing the
interviews.”

big deal is. I think that

get tickets should be

they didn't.

than, say, a person in McKeesport
or wherever. You pay your stu-
dent activities fee," he said.

However, he said that, in prin-
ciple, he agrees with Bozik.
"You're asking him to give away
his products. 1 would think there
is a price value here," said
Hillgrove.

’’I happen to feel he could
probably do a lot for public rela-

tions [if he were to televise the
game]/’ said Hillgrove.

The possible side effects of the
blackouts were also brought up.
Kyslinger said, "There are impres-
sionable high school students out
there.” He said he feels would-
be recruits may ignore Pitt on the
basis that blackouts lessen the tel-
evision coverage of the team.

Kyslinger, who gathered about
1,500 signatures for his petition,
said he has received the utmost
support. ”Every single student,
eV'/‘eifi/’;'single Golden Panther, ev-
ery single alumnus I have asked
to sign the petition has.”

Student Phil Arrigo said that the
size of the Pitt student body, in
relation to the number of availa-
ble tickets, is reason enough for
the game to be shown on cam-
pus: ”The Civic Arena seats
17,000. The school has 30,000
people. It's really depriving. I'm
going to have to listen to it on the
radio instead of watching on TV.
It's really unfair.”

Student Gina Falsetti said it's
unfair to the students who sup-
ported the team when they were
mediocre. ”But most important-
ly, we've lost the ability to sup-
port our team,” said Falsetti.

Pitt basketball player De-
metreus Gore commented on the
matter, saying, "I don't see what
the big deal is. I think that every-
body that can’t get tickets should
be able to watch the game on TV.
if [the athletic department] gave
a reason [for the blackout], I
could understand. But they
didn’t.” He would not comment
on Bozik’s decision.

Bozik’s blackout for

your patron protection?

The ineptitude of Pitt's athletic administration has surfaced
once again.

Pitt athletic director Dr. Edward E. Bozik has decided to black
out Wednesday's sold-out Pitt—Syracuse game at the Civic Are-
na for the second year in a row. The game will be shown for
Pitt students via closed circuit at Fitzgerald Field House.

Bozik told The Pittsburgh Press: "We have an obligation to
people who bought tickets rather than sitting home watching
it free. They paid for their tickets, they paid for their parking;
we want to protect them. This is particularly true for games at
the Civic Arena.”

First of all, Bozik feels he has an obligation to the fans who
are paying to see his product. He may even be worried some
ticket-holders will get so upset about home games being on
television they'll ditch their season tickets and stay at home
to watch the games in the future.

This is the mentality of a small thinker. Bozik is underestimat-
ing the demand for his product. According to Pitt ticket manager
Dick Lukehart, 800 to 1,000 people are on a waiting list for
season ticket’s for next year alone.

Pitt basketball is arguably the hottest ticket in the city of Pitts-
burgh right now. Bozik doesn't realize this. If he does, his
reasoning is way off base.

Bozik told the Press: "We're not always going to be 16-2 this
time of year. What we're trying to do is maintain the term value
of the Pitt basketball ticket."

Pitt basketball is indeed a hot ticket because of the team's
success, but it is also in demand because: a) there's little rea-
son to believe Pitt will not have a perennial Top 20 program
for years to come, b) Paul Evans’ coaching style is consistent
with what Pittsburgh fans like — hard work and discipline, and
c) this city has been starving for a true champion since the Pirates
and Steelers in 1979.

We assume these points of contention evade Bozik. He
doesn't have any consideration for the Pitt basketball fans in
this city. All he sees is the bottom lihe. Bozik’s alienating thou-
sands of fans who won't be in the stands at Wednesday night's
game. But Bozik’s definition’ of a fan is unique. Bozik’s only
fans are the ones who pay money to see the games.

No wonder Bozik was greeted by a round of boos at the Pen-
guins’ game Saturday night when former hockey star Bobby
Orr presented Bozik with a $10,000 scholarship for walk-on
athletes at Pitt.

How can't you boo a guy who alienates the sports fans of
his city to protect Pitt's pocketbook? A pocketbook that has no
chance of deflating, even without the blackouts.

It's getting rather distressing to watch the public perception
of Pitt's football and basketball programs suffer because of the
shortcomings of the leaders of the athletic department. An ath-
letic department that is an absolute joke considering the quali-
ty of its money-making programs, namely football and
basketball. V

Pitt's athletic teams are big-time, but they're all run like small-
time collegiate programs.

The Pitt football team's trip to the lowly Bluebonnet Bowl
and the blackout of home basketball games — two recent ex-
amples of poorly made Bozik decisions — show just how poorly
he plays the sports administration game.

The members of the Khomeini

To dismiss Rambo as just

cism. Personally, I think Stallone
would make a better Chippen-

while Stallone and his ex—wife

ties from the movie series, please
don't write off the real issue be-
cause of an adventure movie's
box-office success.

The real issue is that American
servicemen are still being held
captive in Southeast Asia. There
is also evidence of Westerners,
such as journalists, and relief
workers being held prisoner for
over a decade and a half.

But who cares?

Unless you have a loved one
missing in action, why would you

I care.

The second Rambo epic serves
the cause of enlightening the

public to the fact that everything.

Americans missing in action may
not be true. It's a reminder that
various government agencies act
on their own for reasons that they
rarely disclose.

Pitt focuses on drug awareness

By Stephanie Gruich

Staff Writer

It's the week to focus attention
on the effects of drug abuse on in-
dividuals and society and to dis-
courage drug abuse among
students, faculty and staff on col-
lege and university campuses na-
tionwide. This week is the first
annual National Collegiate Drug
Awareness Week. It is being
sponsored by the Inter-
Association Task Force on Alco-
hol and Other Substance Abuse
Issues.

Pitt's Health Education Office's
advisory board has invited cam-
pus organizations to participate in
helping promote drug abuse
awareness, according to Shirley
Haberman, a health educator at
the Student Health Service.

Bridgette Guernsey, Greek Ad-
visor said that one of the pro-
grams being held this week is

”Drugs, Alcohol and Sexuality.”
Guernsey said she ”is not sure on
the attendance” but is hoping for
a good turnout. The event is be-
ing held tonight in the ballroom
of the William Pitt Union at 8
p.m.

Another event geared especial-
ly for campus resident advisors
will be held Wednesday. The fo-
cus is on training the RAs to bet-
ter identify early signs of drug
abuse. This is being conducted
through the Office of Residence
Life.

”We basically want to bring to
light that some students will have
problems in the future. We want
to effectively intervene and get
them to proper resources," said
Haberman.

Rick Herrnberger, a Pitt stu-
dent, said, ”lt’s impossible on a
university campus [to monitor

students] because it's too large. .

An RA is not around his or her
residents enough to notice a
problem. A friend, however,
could.”

”We can associate low-grade
point averages, missed classes,
driving
under the influence and unat-
tended sexual activity with drug
or alcohol abuse,” said
Halagrman.

-Although this is a targeted
week, Pitt has already taken ac-
tion against drug abuse. Weekly,
there are campus events that are
offered for students, faculty and
staff to enjoy — without alcohol
being served. The Pitt Program
Council is also presenting the
Coffee House, movies in David
Lawrence Hall, and the new
nightclub in the WPU concourse
area.

Q,

SPORTS

A THE PITT NEWS

What do out—of-state players see in Pitt?

One day as I was sitting around
and contemplating the universe,
as I so often do, the question oc-
curred to me, ”How has Pitt
managed to land such a high-
quality recruiting class for'l’66t-
ball the past two years, particu-
larly out-of-state recruits?”

Let's face it, a recruit who
comes to Pitt from, say, Florida,
gets lousy weather, a campus
which is something less than
spectacular, no guarantee of play-
ing before large crowds at the
stadium and, lately, no guarantee
of playing in a bowl game, much
less a major bowl.

Then I thought of all the stock
answers. Pitt has had a huge

number of players make it to the
pros. Pitt has had 27 first-team
All-Americans in the past 15
years. There were four former
Panthers playing in this year's Pro
Bowl. Pitt is located in a major
metropolitan area, with lots of tel-
evision stations and newspapers
to chronicle the Panthers’ ex-
ploits. Pitt has won nine national
championships, which places
them sixth all-time. And finally,
Pitt is academically one of the top
state or state-related universities
in the country.

While the reasons listed above
are undoubtedly factors in an out-
of-state recruit’s decision to at-
tend Pitt, the real reasons for

VINCE
LONGO

choosing Pitt are actually more
likely to be tangible, practical rea-
sons. Playing time is one such
reason.

”I couldn't see myself playing
at Michigan any time soon,” said
Pitt quarterback and Detroit na-
tive Darnell Dickerson. ”They
have two good quarterbacks
now, and they might want to
change my position. I wanted to
get away from home -—- there's

nothing to do at home — and I
had a chance to play here as a
freshman. I didn't start to think
about Pitt until they started
recruiting me. As I was growing
up, I always thought about play-
ing for LSU or maybe Ok-
lahoma.”

The type of role a recruit figures
to play on the team is also an im-

portant factor, according to Pitt 5

running back and Florida native
Ronald Redmon. Redmon was a
highly recruited and talented
back from Miami who chose the
Panthers over the mighty Hurri-
canes. Why?

”Miami seems like a place for
quarterbacks and receivers," said

7

Tuesday, February 9, I988

Redmon. ”Here, the running
back is more well-rounded. At
Miami, you rarely get a chance to
run the ball.”

Some players cite even more
basic, no-nonsense reasons for at-
tending Pitt. Panther kicker Jeff
VanHorne, a native of the state of
Washington, was regarded as one
of the top five kickers on the West
Coast and was recruited by
Washington and Washington
State, among others. So what
turned Jeff off about State U.?
”Washington and Washington
State don't give scholarships to
their kickers,” said VanHorne.
”They want you to walk on.”

The women's gymnastics
team traveled to Missouri last
weekend for the Purina Cat
Classic.

The Cat Classic is one of the
most prestigious invitationals
in Women's Division I gym-
nastics. Competing for Pitt
were seniors Kim Calderone,
Cathy Coleman and Leann
Vaughn; juniors Trish Aser and
Stephanie Megill; sophomores
Hope Celani and Shelly Sleith;
and freshmen Jeannie Vecchio
and Kathy Wallish.

The meet featured high—level
teams such as the University of

Arizona, Auburn University,

Penn State University and the
host team, University of Mis-
souri. Considering the high
level of difficulty and con-
sistency these teams attained,
Pitt failed to place in the top
three.

On their first two events,
beam and floor, the Lady Pan-
thers had their share of mis-
takes. According to Coach
Debbie Yohman, ”The cause
for some of the mistakes was
simply nerves. Other mistakes
were due to a combination of
adding new skills and compet-
ing at such a high-level meet.”

Despite the problems on
beam and floor, Aser and Wal-
lish advanced to finals — Aser
on beam and Wallish on floor.

On the balance beam, Aser
made a tremendous comeback
in finals. After a major break
in the preliminaries, Aser went
all out in finals and placed sec-
ond in the event.

On vaulting, the Lady Pan-
thers obtained their highest
vault score for the year with a
total of 45.95 points. Wallish,
Coleman and Sleith all scored
9.0. Aser scored 9.2. Co-
captains Vaughn and Calder-
one both advanced to finals on
vault.

Vaughn, who has been
plagued with injuries this year,
made a great debut perfor-
mance for the Panthers, scor-
ing 9.35 in prelims and 9.2 in
finals.

I-,. .
Pitt's Trish Aser’s performance on the balance beam wasn't enough to vault the Panthers to victory at the Purina Cat Classic in l\4issouri.

Lady gymnasts clawed at Purina Classic

Calderone, who competed
all-around in the meet also
had great vaults in both pre-
lims (9.4) and finals (9.45). She
placed fourth in the vaulting
event.

On the uneven parallel bars,
Sleith and Calderone each had
one fall but still managed to
score well with 8.3 and 8.5,
respectively. Coleman had a
minor break but also scored
well with 8.85.

Celani, Wallish and Vecchio
received their highest scores of
the year on the unevens with
8.7, 8.8 and 9.25, respec-
tively.

Vecchio advanced to finals
on the event and perfomed
very well, receiving 9.0.

 

.. er/The Pm N..

 

Coach Yohman was very
happy with the trip to Missou-
ri. ”The trip was good, and it
was a real fun meet with high-
level gymnastics,” she said.

Even with the mistakes and
injuries, the Panthers scored
higher than when Pitt went to
the Cat Classic two years ago.

”Hopefully, next time we
get invited back, we'll be able
to close the gap on a couple
of those teams,” said Yohman.

Yohman also added, ”Over-
all, it was a really exciting
meet for the kids. They com-
peted with two of the top
teams in the nation [Arizona
and Auburn]. My seniors per-
formed really well.

AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA —— Coach
Joe Paterno appears to have
struck gold in recruiting what
he has said will be his last
four-year class at Penn State.

Paterno already has commit-
ments from seven members of
the 1987 Associated Press All-
State Scholastic Football team
and at least seven more blue
chip out—of-state prospects.

Although Pitt beat Penn
State this year on the _playing
field, the Panthers have ac-
quired just four from the AP

other areas.

Paterno apparently is in-
forming his recruits that they
will be his last full-term group
since, barring unforeseen cir-
cumstances, he plans to retire
when he reaches 65 in 1991.

Wednesday is the first day
recruits can sign letters of
intent.

From the AP first-team
offense, Paterno has recruited
interior linemen Brian Dozier
(6-foot-4, 280-pounds) from
Chester and Todd Rucci (6-6,
260) of Upper Darby; running
back Bobby Samuels (6-0,
180) from Farrell and probably
end Rudy Glocker (6-6, 228)

squad and at least six from.

Paterno continues
getting cream-of-the
crop in recruits

of Owen J. Roberts. Glocker
still is looking at Virginia.

On defense, the Nittany
Lions have in tow end Rick
Sayles (6-5, 205) of
McKeesport, and linebacker
Eric Renkey (6-3, 240) and
back Chris Cisar (6-2, 195),
both from North Hills.

In addition, Paterno talked
quarterback Tony Sacca of
Delran, N.J., rated one of the
best prospects in the nation,
into casting his lot with the
Nittany Lions.

The scuttlebutt is that Pater-
no sold Sacca on his ”grave-
yard” for quarterbacks by
pointing out how much his
ground-oriented Lions threw
with Todd Blackledge in the
1982 national championship
season.

"Penn State also has Adam
Shinnick, a running back-
defensive back from Walpole,
Mass. He was voted the North-
east Player of the Year in Pa-
rade magazine.

Others include: Eric Lewan-
dowski, a linebacker-safety
from Erie Prep; Mark Graham,
defensive back-wide receiver
from Clifton, N.J.; Anthony
Matesic, a two-way lineman
from Bergen, N.J., and Brett
Wright, a linebacker from

Philadelphia's Goukas fired as ‘
coach, Lynamnamed as interim  

By Ralph Bernstein
Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA —— The slump-
ing Philadelphia 76ers fired
Coach Matt Guokas Monday for
failing to win with the team they
said he designed, and replaced
him with assistant Jim Lynam.

Lynam takes over Tuesday
night when the sub-.500 team
that has lost seven of its last nine
and 10 straight on the road opens
the second half of the NBA sea-
son in Atlanta against the Hawks.

Owner Harold Katz blamed
Guokas for the 76ers’ slide from
the league's elite.

When reporters suggested at
the news conference that Katz’s
trades, not Guokas’ coaching,
were responsible, Katz said:

”Every single trade we've made
was recommended by Matty
Guokas. This was Matty Guokas'
team. Every guy was recom-
mended to me by Matty Guokas.

”Moses Malone, Roy Hinson,
every single trade was recom-
mended by Matty Guokas. And
his recommendations almost al-
ways were taken. Yes, I made the
final decisions. I could have ve-
toed. So I am ultimately respon-
sible. I take that responsibility.”

Lynam appeared at the news
conference then left for Atlanta.

General Manager John Nash
said Lynam would coach the rest
of the season, and his contract
would be reviewed after that. Ly-
nam said he viewed himself asan

interim coach whose future
would be determined by the job
he does. H -

”You live and die by your
record,” Lynam said.

In making the announcement,
Nash said, ”Matty is a guy who
contributed a great deal, but this
is part of the package that comes
with the territory of being a
coach. When things are not go-
ing the way you want, coaches
go. You bring someone in to try
and right the ship.”

Guokas, who was told of the
change Sunday evening, was not
at the news conference. He was
not immediately available for
comment.

Guokas had been the Sixers’
coach since June 14, I985, suc-
ceeding Billy Cunningham. Three
days later, he hired Lynam, who
previously had been an assistant
in Portland and head coach of the
San Diego and Los Angeles
Clippers.

Lynam said his immediate task
was ”extracting the maximum ef-
fort from the players. That is a
coach's ultimate challenge in this
league.”

"I haven't got any genius ideas
to turn this team around," he ad-
ded. "We are not playing defense
very well, so we'll have to in-
crease the quality of defense.
We're not shooting well. We'll
have to take some aggressive
steps.”

Asked what Lynam could do
that Guokas did not, Katz replied,

”Jimmy is feisty,” in an obvious
reference to Guokas’ low-key
style. As a college player at St.
Joseph's (Pa.), Lynam earned the
reputation of a firebrand and self-
motivator.

The 76ers enter the second half
of the season with a 20-23 record
in’ second place, 11 games be’-
hind the Ieading Boston Celtics in
the Atlantic Division. They have
made less than 50 percent of their
field goals in 11 consecutive
games, and the opposition has
been shooting against them as a
60 percent clip.

Contributing factors to the
team's woes included Andrew
Toney’s chronic foot problems
and a back injury that has side-
lined starting forward Cliff Robin-
son for the last seven games.

. All-Star forward Charles Barks-‘
ley missed two recent games with '
a sprained left ankle but appeared
in the last two games before the
All-Star break.

Katz said the change was
decided over the weekend in
meetings with Nash.

’'I think that over the last two
weeks, the defensive effort was
not there,” Katz said. "I am not
downing Matty Guokas. Players
do have to motivate themselves.
But when [other] teams are shoot-
ing 60 percent, I don't think we
can say that is quality defense.”

Katz said he had been hoping
that things would get better.

"But they never got better,” he

‘Hockey club splits a pair over weekend

0

By John Labriola

For The Pitt News

Eve_n though the temperature
this past weekend averaged about
10 degrees, things heated up for
the Panther Hockey Club as they
continued to battle for the top
spot in the West Penn College
Hockey Association.

The Panthers took on the Gold-
en Knights of Gannon Universi-
ty on Saturday, losing 6-3. On
Sunday, the Panthers turned their
luck around, defeating city-rival
Carnegie Mellon 7-5.

Although the Panthers lost to,

the first-place Knights, it was a
hard—fought battle. The first peri-
od started off with a goal scored
by the Golden Knights, followed
by two consecutive Gannon
penalties for high-sticking.

A few minutes later, John
Carlins, Panther right wing,

" received a roughing penalty as a

result of a Golden Knight slash-
ing penalty. The remainder of the
first period went without a goal
for either team.

During the second period, both
teams racked up penalties. Marc
Bowers received a roughing
penalty off of a Gannon holding
penalty. Four minutes later,
Carlins took another roughing
penalty as a result of a high-
sticking penalty. Brian Owens
received an interference penalty
as a result of Carlins’ roughing
penalty.

With the Panthers now short-
handed, the Golden Knights
scored their second goal of the
game, taking a 2-0 lead.

The Panthers scored their first
goal of the game in the second
period by Bowers. Gannon coun-
tered with a goal less than a
minute later.

Gannon’s J.D. Faulkner deliv-

ered a blow to the back of
Owens’ neck. Owens fell to the
ice and was helped off by his
teammates, while Faulkner was
given a two—minute high-sticking
penalty.

Bowers scored the second Pan-
ther goal 22 seconds later, but the
Golden Knights retaliated with a
goal of their own, bringing the
score to 4-2.

With five minutes left in the
game, Gannon scored to pull out
a 5-2 lead over the Panthers.

Eric Anderson closed out the
scoring for Pitt on a power-play
goal. Gannon then took two
more penalties, one for interfer-
ence and another for high-
sticking, bringing the number of
Gannon players in the penalty
box to three.

With three minutes remaining
in the game, David Agresti scored
a short-handed goal for the Gold-
en Knights.

”I think we played a good
game, but there were some bad
breaks,” said Jeff Rohay, the Pan-
thers’ goalie. ’’I think we had a
couple of bad breaks in the third
period and gave up a couple of
bad goals.”

”We will have to do a little bit
of soul—searching, so we will
come out and play tough tomor-
row,” said Owens.

On Sunday, that's just what the
Panthers did. They started off the
first period on a power play
scored by Bowers. The Panthers
then scored two more power-play
goals during the first period, one
from Todd Raible and the other
from Owens. This gave the Pan-
thers a 3-0 lead over the Tartans
at the end of the first period.

In the second period, the Tar-
tans took advantage of a short-
handed Panther squad by scoring
their first goal of the game. Two

minutes later, the Tartans again
scored to bring the game within
one goal, 3-2.

With 1:28 remaining in the sec-
ond period, Bill McDade scored
to increase the Panther lead to
4-2. With 31 seconds left, the Tar-
tans scored again.

Three minutes into the third
period, Bowers scored on a pow-
er play followed by another Pan-
ther goal scored by Clontz.

Greg Timmons of CMU reg-
istered a hat trick when he scored
his third goal of the game late in
the third period. This was fol-
lowed by a Panther goal scored

by Jim Jacobs to give the Panthers
a 7-4 lead.

With three minutes left in the
game, the Tartans scored to bring
the final score to 7-5.

”It was a good game and a big
win,” said Coach Bele.

”We owed them one,” com-
mented Bowers. ”When we are
on, nobody can beat us or stop
us.”

”Our defense was excellent to-
day, and the power plays were
fantastic. When Marc and I click,
goals go into the net like they did
tonight,” stated Owens.

The Panthers’ next game is

against Penn State-McKeesport
on Wednesday, Feb. 10 at
McKeesport. Faceoff is at 10 p.m.

”We have got to play the same
way we did today to win against
Penn State. We also have to
check hard and stay out of the
penalty box,” said Bele.
Owens, the Panthers’ captain,
said, ”They have a good
goaltender, Mike O’Brian. And
Lance Riddle, their center, is also
good/’

On blackouts, books, bowls and

basketball —- Sports’ Killer B’s I

With the expected sellout of
this issue of The Pitt News, the
paper's sports staff has decided to

lift the previously planned black— 8

out of this article. In response,
public outrage has reached anar-
chic proportions.

When was the last time that
a highly ranked college basket-
ball outfit, such as the flashy
UNLV Runnin’ Rebels, has fallen
twice in one season to a basical-
ly unnotable, unscary, perenial-
ly presumed ignored hooper-
scooper team, such as the
University of California, Santa
Barbara Gauchos. Last Saturday
night, it was UCSB 71 UNLV 66,
only the second time this season
that Jerry Tarkanian’s team has
scored fewer points than the op-
position (which, of course, was
USCB on both occasions). Possi-

0 For as many Pro Bowls that

the AFC has won in the 1980s,
you'd figure the conference
would have snapped up a few
more Super Bowl Trophies along
the way. The Super Slate for the

with that, Vince Lombardi is
probably resting quite peaceful-

”|run-intotrouble” Heyward’s
abrupt departure from the Pitt
football program is, in the long
run, a blessing. And maybe not
even one in disguise. Whatever
the amount of yardage and touch-
downs he produced on the play-
ing field, the exchange isn't
comparable when considering
the almost incessant headaches
and reputation—tarnishing antics
that Heyward brought to the
university in the form of assaults,
disorderly conduct, broken
basketball rims at Trees Hall and
plain old badmouthing toward
students and potential Pitt
recruits.

Head football coach Mike
Gottfried made a valiant P.R. ef-

fort at trying to clean up Hey-
ward’s troublemaker image, but
for a college football program
that is wholeheartedly trying to
regain an elite status as a gridiron
power and the respect of an en-
tire nation,‘ bidding a quiet
”goodbye” to Heyward and his
hoodlum antics is most likely a

secure step in the right direction. I”

A‘ 0 If the NBA playoffs were to
start today, the entire crew of
teams that perform in the Eastern
Conference's Central Division
would qualify. Even the division's
last place team, the Indiana
Pacers, are playing respectable
basketball at .500. And looking
for a turn for the worse? Check
out the conference's once-mighty
Atlantic division, where only the
Boston Celtics at 32-13 have a
winning record.

you want to struggle through the
times of some good ol’ boy who
happens to get loaded, laid and
loaded on every other page. Hey
Ken, what happened to all those
great football games you once
played in?

0 Oh, guess what, folks. It
looks like they're probably going
to go through with that blackout.

Relay teams keep
success “on track’

W

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Boosted by a first-place finish
of the 4 x 400-meter relay team,
the Pitt men's track team turned
in a strong performance at the
George Mason Invitational on
Sunday. The relay team of Elbert
Ellis, Rowan Mighty, Chop Bur-
ton and Dave Price finished in a
time of 3:14.73, qualifying them
for the lC4A championships.

The Panther’s 4 x 8()()-meter re-
lay team of Tom Boggan, Chris
Nauman, Tony Brookover and
Dave Moore finished a strong
second by running a 7:43.83.

Calvin Holmes turned in a
strong performance for Pitt in
finishing second in the 55-meter
hurdles with a time of 7.38.
George lfill ran a 7.46 in taking
fourth.

In the 800-meter run, Dave
Moore ran a 1:51.23, finishing
fourth as well as qualifying for the
lC4A championships. Another
fourth-place finish was in the
1500-meter run as Keith Dowling
was clocked in 3:59.14.

Pitt's Paul Friedrich had a
strong showing in the
3,000-meter run, while finishing
second. His time of 8:19.73
qualified him for the lC4A meet.

Panther coach John Vasvary
thought the meet was a positive
experience for his team.

”We had a good meet. We got
some real good things accom-
plished in getting some more
people qualified for the lC4A
championships,” said Vasvary.

But a recruit’s decision to at-
tend Pitt is not based entirely on
practicality. There is still a place
for emotion and just plain gut-
feeling.

”l’ve always wanted to play for
two schools growing up -—— Flori-
da and Pitt,” said Redmon. ”l've
wanted to play at Pitt or Florida
since seventh grade. Also, the
people at Pitt cared about me
more as a person than as an ath-
lete, and the guys on this team
want to win.”

Dickerson agreed.

”The program here is decent —
it's all right. It's a nice program,”
said Dickerson. ”The people treat
you right. My friends thought it
was a good school to go to, with
a good tradition.”

”As for the freshmen and up-
perclassmen, the meet was great
experience for them because it
lets them know what's out there
and what kind of high difficulty
they're up against,” said
Yohman.

It seems that the only thing the
Panthers are lacking is difficulty.
With all the injuries the team is
suffering from, especially fresh-
men Robyn Borchers and Carrie
Carnesale, the team has had to
settle for lower scores due to low-
er difficulty. Borchers and Carne-
sale use a great amount of
difficulty in their routines.

"Until we pick up our
difficulty, we'll have to settle for
the scores were getting,” Yoh-
man stated.

The next meet will be this Sun-
day at Trees Hall against Temple.
The meet begins at 2 p.m.

said. “We just have to try some-
thing new.”

The 76ers’ problems started af-
ter Cuokas took over. Bobby
Jones and Julius Erving retired,
and then came the controversial
trade of Malone, one of the
game's dominating centers.

The 76ers sent the 6-10 Ma-
lone, Terry Catledge and two No.
1 draft choices to the Washington
Bullets for center Jeff Ruland and
Robinson.

Ruland played five games and
suffered a knee injury that forced
him to retire. The 76ers have
been struggling without a big
center ever since. They have tried
Tim McCormick, Mark
McNamara, Hinson and last
year's top draft choice, Chris
Welp. Welp Suffered a knee in-
jury that has sidelined him for the
season.

On the same day they traded
Malone, the Sixers dealt the top
pick in the draft to Cleveland for
Hinson, who last month was
dealt with McCormick to New
Jersey for Mike Gminski and Ben
Coleman. Cleveland took North
Carolina center Brad Daugherty
with the Sixers’ pick.

Guokas, who signed a new
two-year contract last May, built
a record of 119-88 starting with
a 54-28 finish in the 1985-86 and
following with 45-37 in '86-87.

Lynam, before coaching in the
NBA, spent 11 seasons as a col-
lege coach at Fairfield, American
and St. Joseph's.

The Clippers were 30-52 under
Lynam in 1983-84, and 22-39 the
following season before he was
replaced by Don Chaney.

Guokas spent 1() seasons as an
NBA player with the Sixers,
Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City,
Houston and Buffalo.
