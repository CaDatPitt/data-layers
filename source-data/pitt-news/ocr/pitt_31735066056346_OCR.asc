Panthers shock #7 Seton Hall 76-73 in huge upset

By Jim Lakely
Managing Editor

Swish.

It’s the sweetest sound in basket-
ball.

And after Pitt guard Garrick
Thomas’ 23-foot jumper made that
sound with only five seconds left to
beat Seton Hall 76-73 Saturday
night, the Fitzgerald Field House
was filled with the second sweetest
sound in basketball — deafening
roars.

“It feels so good,” Thomas said.
“To beat the number seven team in
the nation feels real good.”

The play that may serve as an
omen to a team with newly-turned
fortune was really just an odd twist
of fate.

“We had a pick and roll set up for
Jerry [McCullough] and Chris
[McNeall,” Panther head coach Paul
Evans said. “lButl they doubled up
on Chris inside and covered Jerry
pretty well on the outside, so
Garrick was left open.”

Swish.

“Last year we were losing those
games,” McNeal said. “But this year
it feels good to knock someone off
and win some Close games. Usually
Pitt comes on the short end of the
stick in close games.”

But not this time. The Panthers
were able to raise their record to
11-2 (4-2 in the Big East) and com-
plete a week of coming up on the

Liverpatiem‘
improves: stable
but still Critical

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

The 62-year-old man who under-
went transplant surgery to receive a
baboon liver eight days ago, is in
stable, but critical condition.

University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center transplant surgeons said that
he is improving but not as quickly as
they had hoped and his new liver is
not functioning to anticipated levels.

“Doctors say this may be why the
patient has not fully awakened,”
UPMC spokesperson Lisa Rossi said
Thursday.

UPMC doctors performed a liver
biopsy on the baboon liver recipient.
A biopsy involves taking a tissue
sample of the liver for testing to
determine how it is functioning.
Doctors inserted a needle through
the patient’s abdomen to retrieve the
sample in a one-hour procedure per-
formed on Thursday. The patient
was returned to the intensive care
unit following the procedure.

Doctors said Friday that the results
of the biopsy were inconclusive.
“Based on their visual examination
during the biopsy and the patient
status, they are treating the recipient
as if there were rejection,” Rossi

long end of the stick. Pitt upset
then No. 15 Connecticut, 80-78, last
Tuesday.

The script for the upset began in
the first half when Pitt could seem
to do no wrong.

Behind an electrified crowd,
McNeal began his 19-point barrage
by hitting shots from all over the
floor while Thomas (16 points)
began his outside assault with his

first of four three-pointers.
Backcourt mate McCullough
showed the over-capacity crowd his
highlight of the game on a sweet
fast break. The 5-foot-11-inch floor
genefal moved around Pirate point
guard Danny Hurley and drew three
more defenders before blindly dish-
ing to a flying Antoine Jones for the
baseline slam and an early 11-9

lead McCullough tallied seven

     

 

said.

UPMC surgeons also removed the
recipient’s spleen on Thursday.
Doctors said they had considered a
splenectomy (surgical removal of the
spleen) prior to transplantbecause
of the patient’s low white blood cell
count

When a liver becomes scarred, as
with the advanced hepatitis B with
which the patient is infected, the
spleen becomes enlarged. The
enlarged spleen then begins to trap
lymphocytes, a type of white blood
cell that helps to combat infections.
Trapping these white blood cells in
the spleen results in a low white
blood cell count in the bloodstream.

UPMC surgeons had hoped the
liver transplant would improve the
white blood cell count, but it did
not, Rossi said.

On Saturday the recipient was still
listed in stable but critical condition.

Doctors said there was a slight
improvement of the liver recipient’s
mental status.

He seemed to be more aware of
his surroundings andwas able to
squeeze the hands of family mem-
bers and doctors upon request.

On Sunday, doctors reported the
patient was again showing signs of
becoming more awake.

On Monday, UPMC doctors report-
ed the patient was ‘‘clinically improv-
ing,” but still listed as critical but
stable, according to UPMC
spokesperson Jane Duffield.

Due to a rise in the patient’s biliru-
bin count, doctors performed an
open liver biopsy on Monday.
(Bilirubin, a component of bile
secreted by the liver, is measured in
the bloodstream to gauge liver func-
tion.)  j.

The results of this latest biopsy
were unavailable at press time.

assists on the night.

A veteran Seton Hall group would
not be flustered. Hard-working for-
ward Jerry Walker answered with a
jumper from the top of the key and
21 tough blue collar bucket in the
paint. Coupled by the sharp shoot-
ing of All—American guard Terry
Dehere and Lithuanian bronze
medalist Arturas Karnishovas, Seton
Hall was able to keep the Panthers
from getting away.

But Pitt gained momentum at the
end of the half when guard Marlon
Rhymes grabbed a Hurley miss and
hit a streaking Orlando Antigua for
a layup as the buzzer sounded to
give Pitt a 39-35 lead.

“I thought the first half was about
as good as we could play,” Evans
said.

Well, it could hardly get any bet-
ter. Pitt shot 54 percent from the
floor and stretched its slight
rebounding edge in the first half to
a 44-32 domination by games end.:

“Our confidence grew as the game
went on,” said McNeal, who ripped
down six pf Pitt’s 22 offensive
boards.

Center-Eric Mobley got into the
act in the second half and got big

Luther Wright out of the game._

Mobley"s quick post moves on the
inside forced Wright to pick up his
third foul very early in the second
half. Smelling blood, Pitt again
worked the ball inside to Mobley,

Stolen campus
shuttle bus
left on corner

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Thursday. night someone was
apparently too impatient to
wait for the campus shuttle
bus.

So he or she just stole it -
out from under the noses of
thecampus police.

The bus was parked next
to the campus police depart-
ment in the Forbes Quad
parking lot, when an unknown
person entered the bus
by pushing open the folding
passenger doors and then
drove it to the corner of Bates
and Bouquet Streets.

“lThe thief] just left the bus
there,” Assistant Director of
Public Safety Gary Moses said.
“We have no idea why he took
it.” ,

The university’s Department
of Transportation recently
spent, $2 million to expand the
campus shuttle and bus system.

Post-Gazette presses start

By Beth Kovaly
Asst. News Editor

Read all about it, The Pittshzirgh
Post—Gazette is back in business.

Exactly eight months after being
shut down by the teamsters strike.
the paper could once again be found
at local newsstands and convenience
stores — if you went looking early
enough.

About 350,000 copies were expect-
ed to hit the stands yesterday.

Still, downtown vending boxes
stood empty early in the day and
some convenience stores sold out as
early as 7 a.m.

In Oakland, Gus Miller’s
Newsstand received about 260
copies of the Gazette and quickly
sold out, according to one employ-
ee.

The 7—ELEVEN on Forbes Avenue
also sold out of the paper early yes-
terday.

Bearing the headline, “Post—Ga7.ette
presses roar back to life after 8-
month strike,” the paper started what
it is calling a “New  The 80-
page, four section newspaper led
with the US. military attack on Iraq.

Gazette managers had warned that
delivery capacity was only going to
be around 85 percent for Monday,
and some of the outerlying areas
might not be covered at first.

Once it gets rolling, the Post-
Gazetle will be distributed as far as
Harrisburg to the east and Erie to the
north. according to paper managers.

On Sunday, the eve of the first
publication, over 1,000 people gath-
ered at the Pittsburgh Hilton 8:
Towers to celebrate the return of the
paper.

The strike, which began on May
17, centered on the Press Co.’s plans
to eliminate teamster distributor jobs.

The Post-Gazette eventually
bought The Pittsburgh Press from
E.W. Scripps Co. for $54 million.

The Post-Gazette now bears the
slogan “And the Best of The
Pittsburgh Press,” in reference to
employees that were brought over,
as what once were Pittsburgh’s two
major papers merge into one.

On Sunday, Teamster President Joe
Molinaro said part of the agreement
that ended the strike involves 260
Teamsters being laid off in the next
five years.

Photojournalist shares
life through pictures

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Through her camera lens,
photojournalist Donna
Ferrato has seen a young boy
scale a wall from fear of his
fathe_r, a young woman
whose stomach was covered
with tire treads from her
boyfriend’s truck and a
young man in a hospital after
being stabbed in the back by
his girlfriend.

For the past 12 years
Ferrato has documented vic-
tims of domestic violence in
hospitals, homes and
women’s shelters. Her pic-
tures, she said, “shatter the
belief that home is the refuge
from the chaos of life.”

Ferrato spoke about the
experiences of the people in
the photos which she pro-
jected on a screen Thursday
afternoon in a Pitt Law
School courtroom.

“I don’t see this work as
art,” Ferrato told the audi-
ence. “I want everyone to
get as much knowledge as
they can about the hard facts
of social violence  These
pictures are all about infor-
mation and I want everyone
to get as much information
as they can about this

because this is the major
social problem, not only in
America, but in the whole
world.”

Continued from page 3
zine to allow her to do
a story on domestic violence
in the early ‘80s, Ferrato
went to live in a women’s
shelter in Pittsburgh,
which turned into a decade-
long assignment that took
Ferrato from New York to
California.

-One photo portrayed a
woman on a hospital bed

‘with a stab wound in her leg

who did not want to press
charges against the stabber,
her husband.

“She told me,” Ferrato said,
“it’s really hard for me when
someone says he loves you,
but would want to hurt you
this badly.”

Another group of photos
depicts what Ferrato had
thought was the ideal family
until she lived with them for

a few weeks.

“But the longer I stayed
with this family the more I
started to see the cracks in
the facade of this American
family.”

The problems began when
the wife hid their cocaine
pipe from her husband.

When the husband realized
it was gone, he got rough
with his wife as Ferrato and
the couple’s baby sat a few
feet away.

Ferrato picked up her cam-
era and took a picture of the
husband yelling at his wife.

As soon as she took the
picture, he stopped, Ferrato
said.

Ferrato continued the
story of this family as
she flipped to another
photo, which showed
the husband in the bath-

IE--‘STUDENT

room with a blow torch
about to light his wife’s furs
on fire.

“I gave all these beautiful
things and I can take them
away if you don’t obey me,”
Ferrato recalled the husband
screamed at his wife.

“He didn’t care that I was
there. He was completely
focused on trying to get the
message across that he was
the boss,” she added.

Unfortunately, this time
Ferrato’s camera could not
protect the wife. Ferrato
snapped a photo as the
angry man struck his wife
across the face.

“I kept thinking, Oh my
god, I don’t believe this is
happening. ‘What the f——-
are you doing? You’re going
to kill her,”’ Ferrato said to
the husband.

The last photo of this fami-
ly is the woman sitting alone

a day later.
“I made her tell me
what she was feeling,”

Ferrato said. “And she told
me that she had always
believed that he loved her
so much that he couldn’t
hit her. But tonight he
had beaten her like he
wouldn’t have even touched
their animals, so she would
never believe in his love
again.”

After seeing many women
in jail for killing their hus-
bands who beat them,
Ferrato asked the audience
why the legal system is
harder on the victims than
the ones who commit the
crimes.

“I don’t understand why
women are punished four

times more for defending
themselves. And the men
who beat them to death are
sentenced maybe a third of
the time of the women’s sen-
tence?”

Ferrato’s lecture and slide
presentation is part of a
month-long lecture series on
women and violence entitled
“Living with the Enemy.”

The event was co-spon-
sored by Pitt’s Women’s
Studies Program as well as
The Women’s Center and
Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh
and Silver Eye Center for
Photography.

The series continues
Thursday with Pitt his-
tory professor Janelle

and he put an incredible
blind fall-away shot in off
the glass after being mauled
by Wright. The conversion
of the three-point play gave
the Panthers a 43-35 lead,
sent Wright to the pine with
four fouls and set the tone
in the paint.

“[Wrightl got beat. I
shouldn’t have played him,”
Carlesimo said. “I gave him
too many minutes, and in
retrospect, he wasn’t ready
to play.

“Our interior defense was
just not good. We never

controlled them on the
boards,” he said. “They
killed us on the offensive
boards all night.”

Seton Hall, abandoning
the inside game, looked
to its guards to bring
them back. Pitt held a
comfortable eight-point
lead at the 10-minute
mark, but the Pirates were
able to pull within four
points with only five min-
utes left.

Just as it looked like Pitt
was going to flinch under
the pressure (as it has done
in the past), McCullough

showed why he should be
considered among the best
players in the conference by
coolly nailing a three-point-
er right in the face of
Hurley to give Pitt a seven-
point pad.

But Seton Hall just kept
giving the ball to Dehere
and Karnishovas, and
they delivered with jumpers
of their own.

With the score 73-72 Pitt,
Thomas fouled Dehere with
36 seconds left and sent
him to the free throw line
to shoot two. Success
would give Seton Hall its

one, and it was an opportu-
nity lost.

“Pittsburgh played very
well  they deserved to
win,” Carlesimo said. “When
it comes down to an end of
a game play you are either
lucky or unlucky. Garrick
made the shot.”

The miss allowed Thomas
to take the winning shot
with the comfort of knowing
that Pitt would at least go to

Short Honeymoon

It’s difficult to understand the irrational thought process of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. After being more than con-
vincingly defeated by the allied forces two years ago, he
has continued to defy UN orders and threatens his Arab
neighbors. Like a nagging child who won’t go away, he is a
reminder of how necessary it is for the United States to, at
least for now, act as the world’s parent.

On Wednesday, Bill Clinton will become the 42nd presi-
dent of the United States. In our lifetime it is hard to
remember a president entering the White House in such
difficult times. For decades there was the evil empire, but
the world was assumed to be largely bipolar with the
Soviet Union and the United States acting as hegemons.
Problems at other global comers were treated as also-rans
— an indirect offshot of US—Soviet relations.

Today, the world is not as simple as “good vs. bad.”
While the fall of the Soviet Union may have made the
world safer for democracy it did little for global stability.
Indeed it may have even manifested it since the Soviet
Union provided aide for many countries.

As such, we cannot ignore many the foreign policy issues
facing us today. Nor can we hardly treat them as “sec—
ondary” to issues such as the economy. Throughout the
election Clinton pledged to focus on domestic issues; and
he should, for one cannot be strong abroad if one is not
strong at home. But Hussein’s actions remind us that the
United States can hardly assume an isolationist stance. Most
importantly, though, as the shift in power moves slowly
toward a more equal United States, Japan and European
Community, and away from US hegemony, it is important
that President Clinton see us through this smooth transition.

While the attention of the media has largely been on
Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia, problems exist throughout the
world. In the Middle East, for example, Saddam Hussein is
but a short—terrn problem. In terms of stability, the larger
problem in this region is the dying peace talks between
Israel and the other Arab nations. Bush brought them to the
table. Clinton has to make them break bread together.

In Asia there is a rising power in China; in Africa there
is not only civil war in Somalia but in Liberia and
Mozambique as well; in Europe the Ukraine has yet to rat-
ify the Start I treaty, which may cause other republics in the
former Soviet Union to become more defiant; in the
Carribean there is the issue of Haiti.

These are just a few of the foreign policy issues facing
the Clinton administration. The surface has hardly been
scratched. To assure global safety it is essential that he con-
tinues to work with the Bush administration and not try to
distinguish himself by immediately assuming command.
For now, we are the world’s one superpower. Of course
we will continue to define what that means, as this admin-
istration and the future ones assume control. For now,
though, the world is in need of strong leadership.

Welcome President Clinton.

Happy to leave Pitt dormitory

More than anything, I want to
find a place to live where I can
stay in my bedroom and find
some peace and quiet. This has
not been much of a problem in
past years, as there had been a
higher level of respect for quiet
hours and for fellow residents.
Such respect has disappeared
this year.

Almost nightly, there is a
gathering of individu-

ria on weekends. If anything
more than money was involved
in that decision, I would be sur-
prised.

Another change was the
installation of ‘ cable.
Considering how Lothrop was
without television since Septem-
ber, this was awaited with great
eagerness. Around the end of
October new TV stands were

Department and the ORL saw fit
to shower us with a barrage of
literature. The ORL distributed
lists to be posted in each hall.
Residents were to sign the list to
indicate the time they were
leaving for break. This silly
exercise was little more than an
invitation for anyone to break
into an unoccupied room.
Fortunately, most residents had
the good sense not to

sign it.
It even seems

These are the same
people who play
their stereos at unnat-
ural levels during the
afternoon. Once
quiet hours arrive, it
is necessary to con-
gregate in the hall,
speaking at volumes
that rival stereos.
This happens
almost every night. I
would file a formal
complaint, but I
would be afraid it
would just be torn
up upon arrival at

the Office of
Residence - Life
(O.R.L.).

I always hoped I would never
have to say these words, but the
time has come: I want to leave
the residence halls at the
University of Pittsburgh.

I have lived in the same room
for my four years here, which
indicates past satisfaction with
the residence hall experience.
Unfortunately, this year has
been an exception.

Sure, it started with promise.
The cafeteria at Lothrop would
open on weekends, eliminating
the traumatizing trip to the
Towers cafeteria. This lasted
through the first semester, but
after careful study the decision
was made to reclose the cafete-

put in the lounges. In the mid-
dle of November, cable lines
were run into the lounges.

Some time in December, the
new televisions arrived. The
pow—er cord from the TV didn’t
reach the electrical outlet. Once
this was corrected, the televi-
sions were up and running. But,
it was finals week, and no one
cared.

Now we have cable, but if
you want to watch Channel 2,
go to Channel 6, Channel 4 is
on channel 5 and Channel 11 is

on Channel 23. Makes sense to’

me.
Nonsense peaked at the end
of last semester as the Housing

like the mail system
has deteriorated this
year. As if this were
even possible. The
delivery times have
reached more erratic
dimensions. Mail is
put in boxes at vary-
ing times and some-
times remains sorted

in the mailroom.

The policy
should be enough
staff to ensure that all
mail delivered on a
particular day gets to
the students on that
day. Rumors have also
circulated in Lothrop
about the theft of packages.
Such rumors have caused many
students to have deliveries sent
to their home, an inconvenience
that should be unnecessary.

With each passing day, I
become more frustrated by the
residence hall. experience.
Unfortunately, the authorities in
these situations have been
ernasculated.

Hopefully, someone will find
the strength and will to handle
problems such as these, or else
there could be an explosion in
Lothrop Hall.

if      

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

A first-year backup isn’t supposed to
hit the final shot of a tension-saturated
Big East battle.

9 A first-year
backup isn’t sup-
posed to even ta/ee
the final shot of a
preseason scrim-
mage, let alone the
most important 40
minutes of what is

fast becoming a successful 1992-‘95
Pitt basketball season.

But in the wonderfully simple bas-
ketball world according to Garrick
Thomas, the rookie shooting star of
Pitt’s dramatic 76-75 upset win over
seventh-ranked Seton Hall, if the
opportunity presents itself with the
game on the line — namely a 25-foot
three-point bomb with five ticks left in
regulation ——- there’s only one thing to
do.

“I just shoot it,” Thomas said. “I
don’t think about it. The ball hap-
pened to be in my hands, so I shot it.”

And you know the rest.

Thomas buries the trey —— Seton
Hall’s John Leahy barely misses a
game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer
— the fanatical throng of 6,798
screaming Panther fans swarm the
Field House court — Pitt re-enters the
Top 25 — Goodnight, Irene.

So in a game saturated with stars of
momentous proportions —— Seton
Hall’s Terry Dehere and Jerry Walker,
Pitts Jerry McCullough, Chris McNeal
and Eric Mobley — an early substitu-
tion for Ahmad Shareef became the
shining star in the biggest Panthers’
win of the year.

After Thomas’ kneejerk rainbow
jumper from the right wing touched
nothing but the bottom of the net ——
earning the Houston, Texas, native the
honor of Big East Freshman-of-the-
Week —— all comments about Pitt’s lat-
est upset act were directed toward the
unernotional, confident 6-foot-4-inch
business major.

“He’s a very good shooter,” Pitt head
coach Paul Evans said. “He’s a little
streaky, so you have to get him in [the
game] to see how he’s hitting. Tonight,
I thought he shot well throughout the

entire game."

“We gave him too many open
looks,” Seton Hall Coach P.J.
Carlesimo said. “The last one he hit
was a deep shot, but when he came in
the game we just didn’t play him. Poor
defense.

“It seems there is a tradition of Pitt

freshmen having a coming out party
against us.”

While Thomas’ party on the Pirates
left Carlesimo and company helpless,
it wasn’t his only admirable work from
the Panthers’ profound version of the
Riﬂeman. In addition to finishing the

Women's boops
erases 19 point
deficit in win
§)y1}]:/sonBran1e

In one of the most improbable comebacks
in Pitt women’s basketball history, the
Panthers rallied from a 19-point first half
deficit to defeat the Georgetown Hoyas.

Easily the most hard fought battle of the
season, the 74-70 victory was sealed when
Pitt forward Tiffany Fingers hit two free
throws with only nine seconds left.

In the first half the Panthers quickly found
themselves down by 11 points. Hoya for-
ward Kris W"rIfill’s jumper at 16:47 of the first
made it 11-0. Pitt finally scored when Tuna
Ransom hit a layup and the subsequent foul
shot . 6

The name of the game for both teams in
the first half was turnovers. Pitt committed 15
while the Hoyas handed the ball back eight
times.

“If we hadn’t turned it over as many times
as we did, we would have won by 10,”
Panther head coach Kirk Bruce said.

Once again‘ this season a tough press limit-
ed the Panthers’ offensive attack. Georgetown
head coach Patrick Knapp instituted a stifling
full-court pressure on Pitt.

“We had a hard time getting it in but not as
much as in the past,” Panther forward Jonna
Huernrich said. “Our guards are getting better
at bringing the ball up and handling the pres-
sure.”

“They adjusted their press for what they
know we had problems with,” Bruce said. “It
gave us a few problems in the first half, but in
the second half we got the ball into Jonna
and Turia. When it comes down to it, I’d
rather score off the press. You can score in
bunches and come back.”

Down 278 the Panthers began their coine-
back. After Hoya Nadira Ricks nailed a three-

pointer to give Georgetown its 19-point-

advantage, the Panthers’ shots started to fall.

Guard Carol Morton and Ransom each hit a
couple of free throws, and Jill Colabrese fol-
lowed by knocking down a three. By half-
time, the Panthers had cut the Hoya lead to
only four.

“Its all about getting [momentum] back,”
Bruce said. “lErinl Maloy hit some key bas-
kets, Fessler hit her free throws, and each girl
picked the other up.”

“Our defense is what got us back into the
game because our shots weren’t falling,”
Huemrich said. “We changed defenses on

Grappling the ups and downs of
wrestling is not easy.

Just ask the Pitt wrestling team
about the weekend that has just
passed them by.

The Panthers, relying on their
momentum gained from the
Nebraska Tournament a week ago,
defeated No. 18 Clemson 21-15.
But then they fell hard on hard
times and lost to a fired-up, nation-
ally-ranked Lock Haven squad 20-
15.

“We wrestled well at Nebraska
and that canied into the Clemson
match,” 190—pound junior Jeff
Kloiber said. “At Lock Haven things

started slow.”

Kicking off the weekend with
Clemson on Friday, the Panthers
were still riding the “high” from
Nebraska. The  was evident
in 118pound Mike Moore. The Pitt
sophomore started things off with a
bang and totally controlled his
Tiger counterpart James Jones.

The match then swung back and
forth. At 126, undefeated Sam
Henson dominated Pitt first—year
wrestler John Ritchey and also
gained a major decision to tie the
match at 4-4.

Coming back at 154, Panther J.J.
Fasnucht took a close 14-8 decision
while Pitt first-year grappler Brett
Gould lost his match in a decision,

STATE COLLEGE, PA — Regardless of the
sport, recent Pitt teams have fallen into a huge
slump against their counterparts from Penn
State. J

The men’s swimming and diving team had
hoped to change some of that last Saturday as
it traveled to face a very strong Nittany Lion
squad.

Unfortunately for Pitt, Penn State swam well
all afternoon on its way to a 144-97 victory.

The Nittany Lions dominated from start to
finish, taking first place in eight of the 11
swimming events. Chip Berry and Adam
Carroll led the Lion cause with two victories
each. 9

Berry controlled the distance events, win-
ning both the 500- and 1,000-yard freestyle,
while Carroll won the 200 butterﬂy and led a

one-two-three Penn State finish in the 50
freestyle.

Despite the loss, sophomore Jonti Bacharach
said that the meet was not the end of the
world for this team.

“For us, it’s a reality check that is going to
help us in the long run,” Bacharach said. “It’s
disappointing for the seniors that we didn’t
beat them, but we were a lot closer to them
than we were last year.”

Sophomore Matt Brady did continue his out-
standing season for the Panthers with two vic-
tories. Brady, who won the 200 individual
medley and the 200 backstroke, said that he
felt strong throughout his swims.

“I was pretty happy with how I swam, tech-
nically things felt pretty good,” Brady said.

As for the team, Brady had praise for his
teammates and their performances against the
Nittany Lions.

them and our shots started
falling at the end [of the first
halﬂ.”

The second half had much
more of an even tempo, with
neither team jumping to a huge
lead or hitting many unan-
swered baskets.

It began much like the first,
however, with the Hoyas build-
ing on their lead and gaining a
nine-point advantage. Niki
Reid’s jumper at 16:06 made it
46-40 Hoyas.

But the bombers returned to
the Panther line—up. Fingers hit
two free throws and then a 10-
footer for the Panthers. Maloy
drained a three, and Huemrich
hit a jumper on the baseline to
tie the game at 53 at 11:02.

The teams exchanged bas-
kets and Georgetown even
recaptured the lead, a 67-66
advantage with 2:34 remaining.
But the Panthers took over at
the foul line and never looked
back.

Colabrese, Huemrich and
Fessler each hit sets of two foul
shots to ice the game for Pitt.

Huemrich led all scorers with
28 points. She also eclipsed the
1,000-point mark in her Panther
career. Hoya forward Kris Witﬁll
became Georgetown’s all-time
leading scorer during the con-
test.

Bruce said he objected to
some of the tactics that Knapp
used during the game, especial-
ly concerning his players’ foul-
ing. Maloy was fouled extreme-
ly hard by a Hoya who, instead
of hitting her on the wrists,
swatted at Maloy’s head and
momentarily dizzied her.

“I thought that the Maloy foul
was dirty,” Bruce said. “If one of
my players fouled one of his
like that and he didn’t say any-
thing, then something would be
wrong.”

Bruce confronted Knapp after
the foul, and the two began jaw-
ing at one another. Knapp had
no comment on the situation

night with 16 points on four—of-
seven shooting from three-point
range — all clutch shots —
Thomas’ defensive effort on
Pirates’ All-American guard
Terry Dehere was just as irnpor—
tant to Pitt’s victory cause.

Although Dehere finished
with a game—high 23 points, the
Seton Hall senior and sure-bet
NBA first—rounder scored only
nine points in the 24 minutes
when Thomas was on the floor.

For Dehere — arguably the ,
best shooter in the Big East — I

Thomas’ deadly accuracy was a
thing of bitter beauty.

.“The range of Garrick
Thomas surprised me,” Dehere

said. “He made some tough I

shots  and his shots were
from NBA range. Coming in, I
didn’t expect that.

those shots.”

Dehere~wasn’t the only player
on the court who was dazed by
the effortless determination in
which Thomas played and shot
the ball. Pitt forward McNeal
was impressed and slightly
amazed at the calm nature of
the first-year guard during the
biggest game of his life.

ers who have never been in this

“Garrick is a freshman  and
he doesn’t know what Big East
basketball is all about. He just
comes in to play his game.”

“I think it was an outstand-
ing meet, and the team is
really starting to come
together,” Brady said.
“Nobody is taking away from
anyone else, and everybody
realizes the common goal.”

The divers also had some
success against a very small
Penn State diving team,
which has been decimated
by injuries. Senior co-captain
Sean Braud took first place
in the one-meter competition
and second in the three-
meter.

Even with Braud’s success,
head diving coach Julian
Krug was not thrilled with
his divers as a whole.

“Today was not represen-
tative of how well we can
dive, and we can learn some
lessons from this meet,” Krug
said. “We have the talent and
motivation to do well, but
we have some improving to
do.”

PITT BITS: Pitt’s next
swim is this Saturday when
the team travels with the
women for a 1 p.m. dual
meet vs West Virginia.

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended by Section 513 of Public
Law 93-568, referred to as the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students,” (more commonly called
the “Buckley Amendment”) requires that the University of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and

students of the following information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of students. In order to do so,

these provisions are binding on the University:

- Individual student records include only information necessary and relevant to the educa-

tional purposes of the institution.

- Student records are open for inspection by students or parents of students under 18 years of

age upon request, with the exception that letters of recommendation written prior to January 1,
1975, remain confidential. Additionally, specific documents that students have waived their right

to inspect remain confidential.

- Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.

- The institution may not release student records outside the institution without student cons-

ent, unless one of several exceptions applies.

- Requests external to the institution for information regarding students should be document-

ed, as should releases of student information.

- The University may establish categories of information known as “Directory Information”
and release this information upon request by individuals external to the institution. This may be
done only after students are provided the opportunity to request exclusions from their information

being released.

Directory information includes the following information:

Name

Address

Phone Number
Major Field of Study

Achievements, degrees, academic awards, or honors
Weight and height, if a member of athletic teams

Date and Place of Birth
Previous Educational Institution
Photograph

Participation in officially recognized activities and sports

Dates of Attendance

When the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System receives a student's refusal to permit

the release of “Directory Information", no further disclosures are made without that student’s writ-

ten consent. (Exoept to parties who have legal access to student records without written consent.)

_ The refusal to permit directory information is permanent. Rescinding of this action can be done by

the student submitting the request in writing to the Coordinator of the Student Judicial System.
Further information regarding the Buckley Amendment may be obtained in 738 William Pitt

Union. If you choose not to have any of the personal information included in Directory

Information released, complete and return this form to 738 William Pitt Union by 5:00 P.M.,

THE PI’IT NEWS, Tuesday, January 19,1993

Wrestling

Continued from page 8
8-1, at 142.

The swing continued at 150 as
Pitt senior Steve Budman won a
major decision, 16-7.

Pitt got another major decision at
167 and pushed its lead to 15-10.
This time it was senior Sean Gibbs
who crushed his winless Clemson
opponent 11-3.

The tide turned for good, how-
ever, at 177. First-year wrestler John
Gilbeaut turned in an impressive
performance for the Panthers and
won a close match with his stub-
bom riding time, 2-1.

“Gilbeaut beat a good wrestler,”
Panther head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “John has done a
nice job this year.” I

Trailing 18-13, Clemson needed
to pin Pitt’s undefeated heavy-
weight, Pat Wrltanger, for the win.
Wrltanger muscled his way to a 4-0
win and sealed the Panthers’ 21-13

victory. Gaining their second dual-
match win of the season,
Stottlemyer was not impressed.

“The bottom lineis, we won,”
Stottlemyer said. “To win the big
matches we have to be more
aggressive.”

The big matches Stottlemyer
spoke of were not too far away. In
fact, on Saturday, Pitt travelled to
Lock Haven to meet the always-
tough Bald Eagles.

The momentum that got Pitt
through the Clemson match was
nowhere to be found against Lock
Haven. The first two matches of the
meet signiﬁed that

At the 118 and 126 weight class-
es Pitt lost both matches and never
seemed to be able to compensate
for the consecutive setbacks.

“The first two matches hurt,”
Stottlemyer said. “It really put us
back on our heels. After that we
were dead even [with Lock

I--' STUDENT

Haven].”
But the intensity and fire seen

just a day before against Clemson .

disappeared like a shy ghost.

“Some of the guys were real ﬂat,”
Budman said. “We were up for
Clemson but not for Lock. Haven. ”

Wrestling well for the Panthers
were Gould at 142, Budman at 150
and Gilbeaut at 177. But those per-
formances were not enough to
beat an inspired Bald Eagle team.

“Basically they [Lock Haven] took
it to us,” Stottlemyer said. “We
didn’t seem ready, we just did not
wrestle well.”

Stottlemyer said there was no
need to panic.

“We have to stay on course and
make subtle changes,” Stottlemyer
said of his team. “We have to be
more intense, and that is something
you learn in the wrestling room.”

Besides handling those crazy
wrestling ups and downs.
