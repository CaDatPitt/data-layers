Predicts Close Victory

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Richard Bishirjian  Senator Barry Goldwater will be‘
elected President of the United States in November. Accord-
ing to the chairman of the Youth for Goldwater movement _
in Pennsylvania, President Lyndon Johnson lacks the. per-
sonality and the selling power to wood the American voter.

Although Bishirjian admits that “if the election were

held today, Johnson would win in

a landslide,” he feels the apparent .; 

Republican candidate’ for the Pres-

idency has a strong grass roots 5
movement that will make Senator "E

Goldwater our 37th, President.

television appearances and rallies
ahead that will sell his personality
to the people.

Ahead Where It Counts

“Goldwater is ahead where it
counts/’. Bishirjian continued. “He
has volunteers working for him
who will go from door to door get-
ting people to vote for him. Peo-
ple will vote for Goldwater as a
favor to their volunteer friends.”

Goldwater's decision to vote
“no”, on the Civil Rights Bill

" “will‘7ha—ve“’little lot" no effect‘ on

the election, according to Bish-

irjian. The Negroes have never‘

voted for Republicans, and-

Bishirjian does "not think that

a- Goldwater “yes” vote would

have inﬂuenced them positively

anyway. '

‘ “The Republicans wouldn’t get
the Negro vote no matter who they
nominated” Bishirjlan said. “But
the’ Negroes have nothing to fear
from Goldwater.” .  A

B-ishirj-ian says the Urrited States
“needs” a Republican President.
He says that the Republicans have
a more realistic concept of the
Communist threat.- “If Richard
Nixon were President,” he said,
“Castro would not be in Cuba now,
we would not have lost Laos, and
we would not be losing the war in
Viet Nam.” - '

According to Bishirjian, while
the Republicans can offer a real-
istic foreign policy to‘ the Nation,
the only thingithe Democrats have
to offer is hand-outs. -“If. people
want a hand-out, they know. who
to vote for,” Bishirj-ian said.

Certain

If Senator Barry Goldwater"

wins the Republican nomination
for the Presidency tonight, it won't;
be because he had popular sup-
port. A recent,._Gallup poll showed
that 60-’ per cent of the registered
Republicans polled favored Gov’-
ernor William vW. Scranton ovei.‘
the Arizona senator. 1

A simzilarlpoll taken two

ago in The Pitt News indicated 

similar trend.

In spite of the lack of popular " ‘ '

support, however, Goldwater has
739 delegate votes behind him, _84

more than the 655,he needs for the

nomination. . -_
In spite of Senator Goldwater's

seem-ing unpopularity among many-

Republicans, however, Chairman
Richard Bishirjian of the Youth
for Goldwater movement in Penn'-
sylvania is optimistic. ' J
“No one is going to bolt, the
party because we have a conserva-
tive candidate,” Bishirjian said.
“The liberals fan the party since
1936. In all that time, the'con-

servatives stayed with the party." ‘

Although 739 delegates have
said they would vote for Senator
Golwater on the ﬁrst ballot, the

Senator actually has about ,- 325.

legally committed, ballots. This
has lead to speculation that Gold-
water could lose the nomination
if he does not win it on the ﬁrs;

ballot.” / 1

 

 
  

‘ “That’s not really true," Bishir§- ‘

jian said. If, Goldwater doesn’t"geb
the nomination on "the first ballot-,

he will -pick up delegates on the . - ‘

second ballot. Either way, Bishirq
jian .conc1ud_ed,j“he’s in." J'__ "

In Dick Bishirjian’s statement Monday that Senator Barry Goldwater will not
only wrap up the Republican nomination today but has cinched the election in Novem-
ber as well, he omitted one factor .—— the difference in the two campaigns.

/The president of Pennsylvania’s Youth for Goldwater described President Lyn-
don Johnson as lacking the personality and the sellng power to woo the voters. But

VGoldwater, he says, “is on the rise. He has a lot of television appearances and rallies

ahead that will sell his personality to the people.” ' -ta . H .
But whether Goldwater’s avoidance of public appearance thus far inlthe race," is
an indication of the “right” needing no further explanation or a safety measure
from foot-in-mouth assertions,_ Governor William Scranton slammed this avoidance as
a bad political move in a Meet the Press conference Sunday night. I . V .
4 The producers had stretched the half-hour show to an hour to.let the press get
that much more of a chance to meet with the two candidates for the Republican
nomination. But all the viewers got was another half hour of free Scranton advertising.

. Goldwater didn’t show.

And when the Arizonasenator backedoutminutes before air time, it wasn’t the
interviewers who pressed the poin-t. It was Scranton. The trouble with Goldwater, the
Pennsylvania Governor pointed out, is that -he doesn’t know how to ﬁght in an election
as the underdog. I’ve done it twice ‘and, I know, he explained. You have to take advan-
tage of every public appearance.’ You have to be more than willing to meet the public

—- he punned, to‘ Meet the Press.

He announced at— that time" his proposalthat Goldwater meet him on the ﬂoor
of the Convention for an unprecedented public restatement of their views. He felt
that the delegates were not com letely sure of Goldwater’s policies and that the
Arizona senator himself needed to clarify them publicly.

Goldwater may have been able to get this far with the press shyness Scranton
was deprecating Sunday night. Bishirjian’s acclaim for Goldwater’s strong grass
roots backing, for the irrelevance of his vote on the Civil Rights Bill, for the impact of
campaigning volunteer groups like the Young Republicans may be true. In this part

of the campaign.

But if today’s events check out Bishi

rjian’s predictions, Goldwater is going to

have to honestly face his public for the real test if theNovember election is going to be

any kind of ﬁght.

Three Jeers For The GOP  .

\

Barry's Merry Men

Tonight the Republican Party will presum-
ably select Senator Barry Goldwater as its Presi-
dential nominee. Governor William Scranton’s
eleventh-hour campaign was not only belated but
half-hearted, and Senator Goldwater’s supporters
were determined not to permit a defeat such as

-the late Senator Taft suffered at the hands of
the Eisenhower-Lodge forces in 1952.

There is in San Francisco an unmistakable
antipathy among the delegates toward what is
,loosely labeled the “Eastern Establishment,” a
Apolitico-ﬁnancial monolith which, according to the
“Goldwater propagandists, has prevented the con-
-servatives from nominating a “real” Republican
for nearly thirty years. This notion has gained
-credence in Republican circles and is signiﬁcant,
‘not in itself, but rather because it demonstrates
“the extent to which the Goldwater phenomenon
is essentially "one of sectionalist protest.

Goldwater’s delegate strength is concentrat-
' ed primarily in the South, in the rural Mid-
~, west, in the Rocky Mountain belt, and in his
' ‘native Southwest. He has only nominal support
J in the urbanized and industrialized states of the
-3 Midwest, the Middle Atlantic region, and New

England. - A

V If one examines the implications of this fact in
terms of delegate voting, one discovers that the"
Senator commands a hegemonic base of wellover
.500 delegates, despite his weakness in the more
populous states, where only one of every six dele-
gates will support him. In short, the Republican
-professionals in the East believe that a Goldwater

-candidacy would prove suicidal in their states, a!

contention which Governor Scranton is all too‘
yvilling to document.

If there is a fallacy in the Goldwater blue-
-print for victory in November (and there are
‘probably many), it is that a candidate can cap-
-ture a Presidential election without winning the

"Northeast. Most analyists believe that the Eisen--

‘hower triumphs were attributable to the General’s
‘ability to cut into traditionally Democratic areas.
‘It is inconceivable to imagine a Republican win-
_ning«a national election without carrying substan-
tial numbers of Democratic votes._ A reactionary
candidate like the Arizonan will only'.solidify the.
elements of the Democratic Party (e.g., labor and
the Negro vote) and alienate members of his own
.-party‘-i  xdseem 

 
 

‘Goldwater ca_ndidacy__

 

AI A Schlosser

precludes the pbssibility of Democratic defections
into the Republican column.

Goldwater is riding a wave of popular frus-
tration and fear, although he is not consciously
exploiting it. His most virulent supporters are
Americans who generally oppose the political
course, both in domestic and international af-
fairs, which the United States has chartered for
herself since the Second World War. To back ,
Goldwater is to repudiate not only the Ken-
nedy-Johnson administration’ but the Eisen-
hower era as well, notably on the issues of
civil rights and international organizations. 4

The majority of the Goldwater faithful do
not believe that the powers of the national gov-
ernment should be brought to bear on racial in-
justice. Goldwater’s suggestion ‘that the President
use moral persuasion ’to assure equal protection
in the Deep South is preposterqus.” He opposed
the Civil‘ Rights Act on the grounds that. it
would lead to a national “police state,”_ and yet
he would leave the Negro to the tender mercies
of George Wallace and Paul Johnson, who pre-

‘side over states‘ in which the’ Negro has neither

legal protection nor recourse". .

V Similarly,*most of the :'.enator’s stalwarts ob-
jected to the Supreme Court’s school desegrega-‘
tion decision and now are hysterical about the
Court’s rulings on public school prayers and re-
apportionment. Each of these cases has dealt a
harsh blow to rural conservatism: the desegrega-
tion ruling affecting their social mores, the school
prayer decision-challenging their religious fund-
amentalism and mythology, and the reapportion-
ment judgments threatening to end their dispar-
ate political power. A

In international affairs the Goldwater crowd

has stubbornly refused to accept as reality,-the
easing of tensions between Washington‘ and
Moscow. These persons genuinely fear. a detente
with the Soviet Union, which would deprive the
crusading and‘- militant anti-Communists ‘of their
cause celebre and undoubtedly weaken the ap-
peal of Goldwaterism. Their unwillingness to
enter into ‘disarmament negotiations is a natural
extension of this fear.

The Goldwater peoplehave prevailed at San
Francisco both in ‘,the compb’sition7of' platform and
the selection Aoficandidates. The American people
will indeed ‘havepa “choice,’i but will the: Grand

Lifeguards’ Linguistic A  
Prowess Saves Lives

Editor, The Pitt News:

In response to the article “Walk, Don’t Corner” in the July
6 issue of The Pitt News we, the lifeguards of Trees Hall Pool,
feel that there was an inference of deﬁciency in operating the pool
because of a language barrier. Don’t be fooled!

We, the four lifeguards, wish to make ‘it known that some.‘
12 languages‘ pertinent to the operation of this Olympic size pool...
are spoken among us. The problem of communication that arose. “

on several occasions was this. . _

Bruce Parker was ‘on chair duty. He speaks I-Iebr_ew.,v Greek,
and Chinese. ‘Will Weisz was in the control room and he speaks
Russian,’ German, and Italian. Frank Reed was on the sun deck
and he speaks French, Latin, and Spanish. At night we are
studying Himilayen from the fourth member of our staff Dick

Hulme. He is an expert in Sanskrit and prepared for his position_

at Trees Hall by procurring his PoS in Sanskrit in the mountains
of northeast India. He also speaks varied. dialects of Hindi.

(‘Dick was off that day.) Anyway, when the stocky, muscular‘

and unconcerned youngman ran along the pool deck Bruce said
“Walk!” over the PA. The man made no response. Reacting‘ in-
stinctively to the situation, he spurted “Lech Leat, hevacacha!”
(This would have seemed like confused babbling to one who does
not know Hebrew.) Still no response from the man. In des-
peration he yelled, “Beta Eta Theta Iota!” which is Greek for
Finally he yelled “Tson!”
From the office Will yelled “Gehen! Nie Begite!” and
“Non,Cerrere!” But, by this time the man had reached his.
_ friends and had stopped. If Frank had been available he
would have called “Marchez!” “Ambula!” or “Andar!” to him
and the man would have recognized his own tongue, Spanish.
You can see that we can handle most situations.
As a matter of fact, last week a very serious situation was
brought under control because of our knowledge of diverse-
languages. We were honored by the presence of the ancient Hali

' Lai Dama of Tibet, Dick’s old friend. He swam into deep water
and Dick was the only guard to recognize his plea for help. This ,_
plea wasiin "Sanskrit and because of our expert, Dick, the 134- "

year-old priest was saved in a ‘dramatic rescue.‘ Those who were
present will remember our efficiency in handling the situation.
So, it has been established that.we can control most situations
and that we can communicate in 12 languages. There is no
running on the pool deck and we hope that this warning" will
suffice. It’s for your beneﬁt. ‘ -
And for those who speak our native tongue, the word is
spelled W-A-L—K! ‘ '

‘The Machineries of. Joy’

By MATTHEW NE SVISKY

Ray Bradbury has gone slick,
and on him it looks good.

Long known only to science ﬁc-

tion and fantasy afﬁcinados, Brad-

bury has, in recent years, extended
himself to a much wider audience
by writing many different kinds
of stories in many different styles,
and publishing them in such di-
verse “slick-papers” as Playboy

' and The Saturday Evening Post.

 

His latest collection of short’

stories, most of which appeared
in the above-mentioned publica-
tions, is ‘The Machineries of Joy
(Simon~ _an_d.: Schuster, 255 Pp.,
$4.50).

Bradbury still turns out science
fiction stories, but they are in the
minority in this collection and, in-
deed,__are minor in value. And
even the science ﬁction is slick;
in the story, “Boys! Raise Giant
Mushrooms in Your Cellar!” for
example, we are not given another
tired. space-opera about an in-
vasion of extra-terrestial fungi,
but rather, the story of a man
who_ thinks that the mail-order
mushrooms being raised by the
neighborhood boys might be from
outer space. The result is a fan-
tastic story told in a t0ngue—jn..
logical-cheek manner.

Shining Ttiuch

The true touch of the poet
shines through, -however, ‘when
Bradbury writes in his favorite
genre, fantasy. In “Death and the
Maiden,” we meet a recluse of
ninety-one who has spent half of
her years afraid of life and the
other half afraid of death. She

. ﬁnally allows death to take her

when he offers the one thing she
needs most: love. ‘
Dressed as a handsome suitor
from the days of her youth, he
offers twenty-four hours of ro-
mantic‘courtship if she will ac-
cept him as a Faithful Lover
for eternity. The aged woman
deliberates and ﬁnally chooses,
walking off on the Suitor’s arm
to a life brief but more mean-
ingful than she had ever known.

Bradbury proves himself no
under-aCheever when writing the
story’ which comments on con-
temporary American life. “A
Flight of Ravens” and “The Best
of ‘ All Possible Worlds” show
quick insight into the dreams, des-
peration, and drama in the world
of the tinsel—eyed martini-weld-

Humor Abounds

Humor, in fact, abounds in this
collection. “The Anthem Sprint-»

crackling comedy it is. The title‘
refers to a group of Irish pub-
crawlers whose main form of ath-

the cinema at the end of the pic-

and fortune of a sort await the

See You A t Intermission . ..

The leading characters,VWilliam Russell and Joseph Cantwell, are ﬁghting for the
presidential nomination and each seeks the endorsement of former President Arthur

to have been based on the actual
characters of Adlai Stevenson,
' Richard Nixon and Harry Truman

and some striking similarities are
obvious. Each character in the

‘ play, however, is really based on

a combination of several modern

political ﬁgures. and of course the-

“Nixon” and “Stevenson” ﬁgures
"are placed in the same party in
the play.

Close Race

Russell is the wealthy intellec-
tual with a philosophic approach
to government while Cantwell is
the self—made politician who is
hard-nosed and practical. Each
distrusts the other’s abilities and
intentions but the race is close and
ﬁnally both men discover that
smear tactics seem to be the only
way to swing the convention in
the desired direction.

Even the ex—president is hard
put to decide which of the two
is the “best man” for the job.
Russell has integrity but lacks
decisiveness. Cantwell is the op-
posite. A

The play makes for an interest-
ing, often funny, often tragic

 r’ story; it becomes particularly sig-

With the Republican gathering in San Francisco stealing all the headlines these
days, Little Lake Theater has wisely decided to follow convention week with the ‘revealing
Wplay about behind the scenes intrigue at a similar convention, Gore Vidal’s “The Best

I

niﬁcant in-view of a similar show
being acted in real ‘life in San
Francisco. There are more than a
few relationships between Amer-
ican' politics and American enter-
tainment. In any event, it would
be engaging to see “The Best
Man” after watching the results of
the current conventxon and won-
dering what went on in the back
rooms of the Cow Palace.
Best on Stage

Even if you have seen the_r_novie
version now playing to much ac-
claim at the Guild, the Little Lake
production is to be recommended.
Though the film departs only
slightly from the stage play, “The
Best Man” is a study in charac-
terization as well as politics and is
the type of story that is best ap-
preciated on the stage.

Melvyn Douglas and Frank
Lovejoy did the roles of Russell
and Cantwell respectively on
Broadway just before the 1960
conventions. In the screen ver-
sion Henry Fonda and Cliff
Robertson are quite good in the
same roles. V

Little Lake has also come up
with an exceptional cast for the
local production. Will‘, Disney,
managing director of the theater,
will play Russell. Tom Gaydos, in-
structor and director at the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse, will oppose him
as Cantwell. Those who have seen
these two men work before know
what "an excellent stage battle is
in store. Two of the ﬁnest actors
in the area will be at work in
scenes which provide them with
head-on clashes.

Familiar Cast

The rest of the cast will be fa-
miliar to Pittsburgh theater-goers
also. Connie Barker‘ and Jane
Ruoss should be excellent as the
wives of the two presidential
hopefuls. Jack Price will do -the
“Truman—Eisenhower” role as the
ex—Presid'ent. Jack Siren will play
the noxious Sheldon Marcus done
in the ﬁlm by Shelly Berman. Lew
Hutchinson, recently acclaimed
for -his effective performance in
“Calculated Risk,” at both Little‘
Lake and the Pittsburgh Play-

house, will play Senator Carlin. _

Helen Carson will be the out-
spoken Mrs. Gamage._ ’

This most capable cast adds
to the timeliness and excellence
of the play andmakes “The Best
Man” a very good bet for a ﬁne
evening’s entertainment this
coming week. '

The Little Lake Theater is lo-
cated south of Mt. Lebanon on
Route 19 about 30 minutes from
the University via Parkway and
Liberty Tubes. By the way, the
Lake has a special deal for stu-
dents on Friday night. Couples
get two tickets for the price of
one. “The Best Man’-’ plays July
20 thru July 25 followed by “More
than Meets the Eye” from July 27
thru August 1st.

See you at intermission.’
