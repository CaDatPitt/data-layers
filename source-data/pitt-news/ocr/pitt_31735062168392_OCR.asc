  13 7 Women Residents

Shape Honors Program
In Tower C Dormitory

By ALAN DISLER

The Honor Dormitory program
for selected women residents has
been expanded to 137 partici-
pants, according to Lorraine Sib-
bet, director of women’s housing.
This number represents an in-"
crease of 81 women over last
year’s initial program.

The Honor -area, comprising
floors 12 through 16 of Tower C,
is intended to provide greater re-
sponsibility and freedom to up-
perclass women who have “ex-
citizenship” and

The applications are screened
by a committee including Miss
Sibbet, president of each quad-
rangle dorm, and the head resi-
dent‘ of Tower C. This year, 190,
women applied for residence in
the Honor area.

Some of the privileges accord-
ed'Honor area residents are: no
curfew, no —limit on number of
weekends taken away from the
dorm, and open houses for the
purpose of men’s visitation. on
weekends. ’

According to Miss Sibbet, the
University has “recognized that
women students have wanted the
responsibility of an Honors area,”
and'that she “expects that they
will be able to assume that re-

' sponsibility.”

" Despite the increased freedom,
Miss Sibbet added that Honors
area residents “must keep in
mind that the area is a Univer-
sitar of Pittsburgh residence,” and
that they must abide by the rules
of the University governing the
Honor dorms. “If they object to
the rules,” said Miss Sibbet, ffwe
can only suggest that they live
off campus, which they are per-
mitted to do.”

Concerning the possibility that
the Honors area program might

 ,...:._,.__._....-— >

be expanded, or that some of the
privileges accorded them be ex-
tended to all of the women’s resi-
dences, Dean of Women Savina
Skewis “could not say for sure.”

According to Dean Skewis, Uni-
versity women are ,“ﬁne, intelli-
gent people,” and that “we al-
ways talk freely with each other.”
Having “great faith in the intelli-
gence and judgment of women
student leaders,” Dean Skewis
does not rule out the possibility
of extension of privileges in the
future, citing the “ﬁne relation-
ship” and “cooperation with wom-
en students” which the adrninis-
tration has maintained.

Two Changes

The School of the Liberal Art
has announced two changes tha
will affect many students. ‘On’

time during which a student ma
drop a course without prejudice
The period has been extended
from four to six weeks." For the
current term the ﬁnal date fo_r__
dropping a course will be October '

This new deadline in no .wa§

ing refunds since a student in
the School of the Liberal°Ar:t’s
must carry at least 12 credits:

 

Much of this progress is due
to the Ford Foundation grant for
the International Dimension,
awarded to the University two
years ago. The grant has support-'
ed individual research, subsidized
the appointments of specialists in
international studies, aided in the
inauguration of faculty seminars
and assisted in the establishment
_of the area certiﬁcate programs.

“With the rapid increase in the
" number. of scooters and motor-
cycles on the campus, the Univer-
sity police can no longer ‘look
the other way’ with respect to
parking infractions,” remarked
Police Captain Charles Ray in a
statement to the Pitt News.

The major concern is with ve-
hicles parked on sidewalks and
entrances where they present a
danegrous obstacle to handicap-
ped students and pedistrians.

_’ Captain Ray remarked, “They
are licensed vehicles and subject
to the same Pennsylvania Motor
 Vehicle Laws as automobiles. Ve-
hicles violating regulations set
up by the administration may be
‘ chain lock-ed and the owner will
‘have to appear personally and
pay $5 to release the chain.”

Illegal areas include: yellow
lines; sidewalks; on lawns at en-
trances, and in buildings or non-
t~raﬂ’ic areas; in restricted Univer-
sity lots, except in space identi-
ﬁed for cycles; in legal ,,cycle
areas from 1 to 6 a.m.', and in

_ the Schenley Quadrangle.

The University has provided
the following locations around
the campus where scooters and
cycles may be parked without

 charge: Schenley Hall on the
 Fifth Avenue Side; Clapp-Lang

- ley Hall Loading Dock; State Hall
beside the front entrance; Gate 1
of the Stadium at the ticket booth,
except when the Stadium is in

the rear of Pennsylvania Hall;
the Dental Clinic, beside the en-
trance; and the Langley Hall
Parking Lot immediately to the

-left of the enrtance drive, as

long as this lot remains in use.
“Pm in favor of cycles,” said.

Captain Ray. “They are a good’

answer to transportation and park-
ing in a highly congested area
such as we have at the University.

Having ridden a ‘big Harley’ a

Ginevan Newly Appointed
Director of iMen’s Housing

This fall the students in the
men's dormitories have a new
director to whom they may voice
their complaints and compliments
about “Tower living.” David
Ginevan has been appointed Di-
rector of Men’s Housing, succeed-
ing Arthur Underwood, now Dean
of Men at Northwestern Univer-
sity.

‘Ginevan views his duties as
“helping men develop outside of
the classroom.” As such, he feels
that the liberal dorm setting, few
rules and no curfews, gives them
the opportunity to mature social-
ly. “We do not feel we should
treat them as high school stu-
dents,” he said.

“The ‘house system’ in the
Towers, is a very effective way

or meeting the needs of dorm stu-
dents,” Ginevan continued. “The
house system gives them a feel-
ing of belonging to a group on
campus.”

Although Ginevan generally
feels that the counseling program
help the students, he feels that
the counselors are too often con-
sidered policemen. He feels that
this is not their place. “Men
should realize that rules are nec-
essary in group living,” he said.

-In viewing his job as “head
counselor,” Ginevan hopes to sat-
isfy the men in his charge. “I will
review every request I get for
roommate changes for February,
and naturally, I will try to cor-
rect any housing errors that have

been made along the way.

" ’ The Air Force ROTC at the Uni-
 versity has instituted a new pro-
gram which eliminates most of

lawn done by that group.

Cadet Lt. . Col David Palacia,
cadet commander, announced at
the Corp‘ meeting Thursday that
 projects will replace most of the

Editorial: Questions to Be Answered   

In August of this month the University embarked upon a new course

. -:'_..of‘»educational leadership. ‘It ceased to be a strictly private institution
'T_gand ‘joined the commonwealth system of Higher Education, thus making

)

our‘University state-related. _
Questions quickly come to the mind of one observing the situation.

 ‘ The University in the last ten years came a long way in becoming an inter-
Y national seat of education. '

When all is said and. done, it is clear that the University will

1 ;gain infinite benefits from the new state-relationship. There need be
 no retrenchment, only progress. The single question that remains un-
i-answered is that of the- out-of-state tuition structure.

It is easy to wonder whether the new state—relationship will mean
backtracking on that course of advancement. The state university, as

 an educational concept, has gained great prestige in recent months. Par-
‘ A tic_ular prominence came to the idea when the University of California at

Berkeley was rated as having the best graduate school program in the
country. ,
Yet Berkeley is in California and the University of Michigan is not

A aistate school operating under our system. It must be frankly admitted
' 1 that neither Penn State or Temple University project the image of the

great learning center so often talked about during the Litchfield era.
The only way to deal with the problem is to try and answer the
questions so often heard on campus.
> The University now has great responsibilities to ‘the State of Penn-

if sylvania. Will the beneﬁts, in the end, out weigh the burdens?

The answer to this question in the final analysis must be a very

 definite “Yes.” Never again will the University be faced with a ﬁnancial

crisis similar to that of the Summer of 1965. The State is committed to
maintaining the University of Pittsburgh as an integral part of the higher

V . education system of this State.

But this support will not only come to the University intimes of
extreme need. The period of sustained growth that our school is now in
will continue because we now have the necessary ﬁnancial aid. The build-
ing program in evidence across the campus will expand and eventually
provide much needed facilities for students such as additional dormitories,
a student union, and added classroom area.

Because of increased state funds, faculty can be increased and
salaries can be raised. The real beneﬁts for the faculty however still are
uncertain. This year thirty-ﬁve members were added‘ to the faculty, but
at the same time student enrollment was substantially increased.

_ > Will not the increases in enrollment create a extremely crowded

   

This question can again be definitely answered-—“No.” While DI‘,

' Kurtzman recently predicted a full time enrollment of 30,000 sometime

in some future year, he also clearly predicted the inauguration next year
of a $104.8 million building program.
As was the case this year with an increase in enrollment, new faculty

would also be added. The enrollment of the University will increase only .

as fast as the school’s facilities are expanded.
> Will academic freedom at the University be affected by State con-
trols?
There seems absolutely no possibility that this could ever happen.

This has never been the case at Temple or Penn State. As Dr. Kurtzman ,

pointed out, the University has been receiving State-aid for many -years
and never has there been any problem.

> Will the quality of the student body diminish under the state—rela-
tionship?,

Facts and figures indicate that the other universities and colleges
in the area will also have to increase their facilities so as to meet a pre-
dicted population growth in Western Pennsylvania. If the other institu-
tions also expand, the University can continue to admit a high quality
student. Community colleges, now opening in Allegheny County, will
absorb many area residents. Moreover because of the lowered tuition, the
University will be able to attract top level students from low income areas.

1 Previously these students might have gone to Temple or Penn State be-

cause of the University’s high costs.
> Will the University continue to- have a cosmopolitan student body,
gathering people from all across the country? '
This question, one of the most pressing, can only be determined by

future events. If our tuition structure remains the same, it is doubtful

that we can attract many out—of-state students. However Dr. Kurtzman
has stated that he is working for swift reduction of out-of-state fees.
It is imperative that the University take this step and give it, top
priority. A balanced out-of-state tuition scale similar to that at Temple
University would open the doors of the school to students from varied
geographic and economic background. Without a reduction of this type
the University will inevitably lack an essential ingredient. A student
body must be judged on the basis of its diversity as well as its intellectual
achievement. » 1
The new state—relationship opens innumerable doors for the Uni-
versity. It will give the University sustained support so that it can con-
tinue without interruption along the road of achievement it has followed
in the past decade. The one gnawing question of out—of-state tuition
should not be allowed to haunt us too long. It is our hope that the prom-

I The New Challenge at

 

 From the Chancellor

 

At no other time of the
year is there quite the same
kind of excitement and con-

 fusion on campus as during
='-1.. the ﬁrst few days of the fall
' '-term. The halls boil with peo-
ple, the bulletin boards bris-
 _ tle with notices, the quad-
. rangle is a snarl. Lines at
 ‘._the bookstore and the cafe-
’. teria seem to stretch into
 eternity. .
_ ‘ Through it all there is
,- a hint of fall in the air; peo-
ple are beginning to talk
football; there is a sense of
_ -newness about the institu-
.___tion despite its 179 years.
 1- , That newness takes much
 of its direction from the
emany forms of change which
surround the University.
Change is a constant in a
University and fall is the
 time when change seems

  

ated.
Some of the changes are
; visible. The stone facade of
the Hillman Library ﬁlls
, that gap of sky where bare
’ steel beams pierced the emp-
tiness last spring. The head-
acheballs have leveled the
Logan Armory to make way
for the new engineering
building. The Matthews

 

Building on Forbes St. has-

been demolished in prepara-
tion for the Common Facil-
ities Building. The annex to

lie‘ Health Building is under

completion.

The internal changes are
most difficult to see. Pitt
starts its 179th year with
three new academic depart-
ments — computer science,
metallurgical and materials
engineering, and microbral

and molecular biology—and

a number of new programs,
professors, and distinguish-
ed visitors. —

 Support Milton Shapp

The Man For The Times

By Linda Goldstein

AS COLLEGE students, it
is our responsibility to ac-
tively- support candidates

— who represent our beliefs.

John F. .Kennedy, for ex-
ample, was the very personi-
fication of the idealism and
dedication that college stu-

dents admire so deeply. One

of his greatest achievements
was his ability to inspire
thousands of young people to

enter the political arena to”

fulfill their desire to serve

the American people.
Kennedy has a worthy suc-

cessor in Pennsylvania. Just

the feel of an old manuscript
in your hands, or by inter-
preting a work of art.

Pitt cannot give you an
education. Pitt can only pro-

vide the opportunity for you

to receive an education. The
classroom, the lecture hall,
the lab, the football ﬁeld, the
debating rostrum, the con-

cert hal1—all are part of the -

opportunity the University
holds forth. ' 

That opportunity is new
each year. What you will do
with it will not be quite like
what anyone before you has
done with it.

In welcoming you—both
you who are returning and
you who are new—it is my
fondest hope that education
will get ‘into your bones in

such a .way,_that "you will

as John Kennedy sought a
public mandate in the pri-
mary races during the 1960
campaign, Milton Shapp went
to the people in his quest for
the Democratic gubernatori-
al nomination \last spring.
Unlike Kennedy, Shapp was
rejected by the leaders of
the Democratic organi_zation,
who felt that he had not
adequately demonstrated his
qualiﬁcations. But Shapp,
whose entire life had been
highlighted by rising to chal-
lenges and succeeding against
odds, was determined to take
his caseto the people and
let them judge._

No other businessman has
ever received the AFL-CIO
‘Outstanding Citizen Award.
No other industrialist has
ever taken upon himself the
responsibilty for issuing a
detailed monthly report ana-
lyzing Pennsylvania's prob-
lems and offering solutions.
And no other man has ever
defeated the organizational
the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination in
the history of Pennsylvania.

beginning. He is battlingone
of the smoothest public re-

Pennsylvania in the form of
the current Republican ad- .
ministration. Shapp can and ‘:
will penetrate through the
facade. His stands on issues
such as higher education re-
flect his capacity for seeking
new and better solutions to

our state for years. ‘

Long Liv

: The grand old lady of
 Pittsburgh aristocracy has
" done it again, Miss Helen

 Clay Frick, the sole surviving

Henry Clay Frick, has begun
a crusade against acedemic
freedom. She is currently su-
ing Dr. Sylvester K. Stevens,
9 a historian, for making
I; “false, scandalous malicious

’ and defamatory” statements
about her father in Stevens’
 book, Pennsylvan.ia’— Birth-
. place ofa Nation.

_ ' Mr. Stevens based his
‘writings on investigation of
historical data and his own
’ background in history. He
“ holds a Doctor of Philosophy
;degree from Columbia Uni-
j versity, served as State His-
_torian of Pennsylvania for
~ 19 years, and is currently in
‘ his tenth year as executive
., director of the Pennsylvania
‘ “ Historical and Museum Com-
 mission. Miss Frick, a promi-
. nent philanthropist in the
 Pittsburgh area, has based
 ‘her statements on her recol-

  

 I lections of her father as‘

_, ““an upright and honorable
~ man.”

 The suit began in January,
 1965, shortly after Stevens’
 book was published by Ran-
‘ dom House. In the summer
“ of 1965 evidence was pre-
; sented before Common Pleas
 Judge Clinton R. Weidner in
,’ Carlisle, ‘Pa. In mid-July,

@1966, Judge Weidner ruled
that Stevens could not use
 any secondary material (e.g.,
, other histories or reference
I *=works) as evidence. The rul-
—. : jg mg included works, by schol-
 ars such as Ida Tarbell and

 

daughter of industrialist »

Allan Nevins. Stevens’ attor-
ney now has an appeal pend-
ing for the, United States
District Court in New York
to intervene on the grounds
that the suit violates the de-
f e n d a n t ’ s constitutional
right of free press.

There is mixed opinion
about the seriousness of the
case. Simon H. Rifkind, Stev-
ens’ attorney, and an ad—hoc
committee of historians claim
that a successful suit by
Miss Frick “would inhibit
our (the scholars’) right to
speak freely about the past
based upon scholarly re-
search, and . . . would per-
mit the descendants of long-
dead historical figures to
have serious books removed
from circulation simply be-
cause something critical was
said‘ about their ancestors.”

ON THE other hand, Miss
comic escapade by a wealthy
woman which will be dis-
Frick’s suit can be seen as a
missed either by a local,
state, or federal court. What-
ever the outcome, and cer-
tainly Dr. Stevens’ cause
seems more worthwhile, the
action of Miss Frick must be

  i  ~ ‘     '

of foremost concern to the
University community.

The University has accept-
ed considerable gifts from
Miss Frick (e.g., Henry Clay
Frick Fine Arts Building)
and the names Frick and
the University of Pittsburgh
are intimately associated.
While Miss Frick’s philan-
thropy has seem designed to
support and stimulate aca-
demic endeavors, her current
legal action contradicts such
motives and makes her con-
tributions .to the academic
community relatively mean-
ingless.

If the University stands
idly by- during the proceed-

ings it too will be indulging _«
in hypocrisy. The Faculty

Senate and Student Govern-
ment are both obligated to
announce their opposition to
Miss Frick’s action. She has
demonstrated an unfortunate

preference for personal sat-

isfaction over academic free-
dom. While faculty and stu-
dents can neither assuage
her desires nor" substantial-
ly affect the judicial deci-
sion, they must demonstrate
their preference for academ-
ic freedom.

Additional Revenue
Used by University
For Tuition Reduction

By DAN BOOKER

State relatedness for the Uni-
versity has been called by some
observers the most substantial
change in the University’s posi-
tion since its very inception.
Others, including Acting Chan-
cellor David Kurtzman, seem to
feel that state relatedness is only
a matter of the degree of money
received from the state and that,
though change will be substantial,
it wil not be overwhelming.

Not enough time has passed

since the University became state
related to decide which of these
views is correct. But, no matter
which one proves valid, at least
some changes will have occurred
in the University. Tuition cuts,
increased enrollments, and an ex-
panding physical plant are a few
of the immediate changes. The
story of the legislative journey
of the bills that allowed these
changes and alterations to be
made is in itself an interesting
tale which gives University stu-
dents a lesson in the political
game as it is played in Pennsyl-
Vania.

When the governor signed, on
August 23, the bill providing for
state relatedness the story was
ended and the lesson learned.
Students had been led through
a four-month gauntlet of exasper-
ation, hope, bitterness, partisan
politics and even a row over
birth control. They had experi-
enced a rather common occur-
ance in American politics—only
:1 small battle was fought over
the Pitt bills themselves, but they
became pawns in a much larger
legislative war. To many stu-
dents, every additional day spent
on haggling over a seemingly un-
related bill was agonizing.

What. then, is the story?

I

The tale has its roots, as do
many current University prob-
lems, in the ﬁnancial crisis of

last summer. However, though
the state provided the University
with a $5 million emergency allo-
cation last fall, students were not
introduced to the term “state re-
latedness” until early in March
of this year. In that ﬁrst week
of March, newspaper stories be-
gan to appear linking the Univer-
sity and the state. One story
mentioned a drop in tuition and
the ﬁgure “450” began to be in-
cluded in rumors. By the third
week of March, Governor William
Scranton had called for a special
session of the legislature to deal
with, among other things, state
relatedness for the University.

On March 24, representatives
of 12 colleges and universities in
the area met in Pittsburgh to dis-
cuss the effect of possible state
relatedness for the University on
their own institutions. The heads
of Duquesne University and
Mount Mercy College expressed
fears that their schools might be
hurt. Officials of other schools ex-
pressed little or no concern.

After three weeks of such
meetings and discussions, the
General Assembly opened its spe-
cial session. That same day. April
18, bills were introduced into
both the Senate and House which
would provide for official state
related status for the University.
The Senate measure and the
House bill differed only in the
number of trustees to be appoint-
ed by the state. Senators Robert
D. Fleming and Albert Pechan,
chief sponsors of the upper house
bill, provided in the bill for the
appointment of nine members to
the Board of Trustees by the
state. The House bill, sponsored
chiefly by K. Leroy Irvis and
James Gallagher. called for 12
state-appointed trustees.

The bills were given first read-
ing in their respective houses and
then referred to committee——us—
ual procedure. The area of most

quested by the Governor, with Thompson repre-

The Pitt News.

immediate student concern was
the much discussed tuition cut.
A scare that only freshmen would
get the proposed slash in rates
had appeared a few days before
the special session opened.
Enough prominent legislators had,
however, promised that the cut
would be for all full-time stu-
dents so that concern quickly
diminished. A week after the
"freshmen only” scare, Rep. Gal-
lagher, chairman of the House
Higher Education Committee, was
even talking about a reduction in

rates for part-time students.

On this optimistic note, the
winter term ended and in-state
students headed for home fully
expecting to need only $250 on
September 7.

Here, the story paused for
many students-—those who could
not keep track of developments
over the summer. The strange
letter from Comptroller Paul Sol-
yan that accompanied the aca-
demic invoices came as a com-
plete surprise to these people. Not
having followed the story, these

Tuition Discrepancy

Students Criticize Great Difference

By ROBERT ZAVOS

The $1,150 difference in tuition
between in-state and out-of-State
students has brought much criti-
zism from both in-state and out-of-
state students. Acting Chancellor
David A. Kurtzman has said that
the University did not have time
to make an adjustment for out-
-of-state students this trimester,
but something might be done for
the winter trimester.

Meanwhile, Jon Meyers, Stu-
dent Government (SG) Senator,
has suggested that SG form a
committee to act as a “sounding
board” to get out-of-state student
reactions. He said that the ﬁrst
corrective step should be to re-
move the ‘$100 per trimester out-
"of-stateffee. - '

When queried about the tuition
difference, out - of - stater Tom
Sacks, chairman of the Liberal
Arts Cabinet, said, “The move
will hurt the University because
the student body will he basically
from Western Pennsylvania. By
‘having the student body_concen-
trated from one geographical area
an institute of higher learning
sacriﬁces a. great deal of its aca-
demic atmosphere.”

With regard to the present tui-
tion situation, Bill Cabin, former
editor of the Pitt News and now
president of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, stated, “It is a tacticle mis-
take from both the viewpoint of
getting a diversiﬁed student body
and from the point of inequality.
I realize that" no "state schools

gn

charge the same rate for in-state
and out-of-state students, but the
cliscrepency here is too much.
The out-of-state tuition should be
lowered several hundred dollars."

Out-of-stater Roy Meckler, who
is also business manager of the
1967 Owl, said, “The student body
will suffer because out-of-state
students will not be fairly rep-
resented. The University loses
something when it lowers the di-
versiﬁcation of the student body.
State relatedness was necessary
but the difference in rates is too
much.”

Another out - of - stater, Bernie
McLeod, feature editor of the Pitt
News, expressed a different point
of‘ view: “A person chooses his
college on how much it has to

‘offer and the choice is free. If _he

would rather pay more at this
University than at a lower priced
school in his own state, it is be-
cause he wants to be here.”
Howard Ainisman, SG vice-pres-
dent, stated, “The tuition cut was
inevitable since it is necessary
for state residents to go to school
in Western Pennsylvania at a
reasonable cost. It is unfortunate
that out-of-state students who
have in the past paid higher tui-
tion still have to pay.”
Whatever the final outcome
will be, the general consensus is
that the tuition cut for state res-
idents was necessary, but the cost
to the University in the lack of
student body diversity might be
too high unless something is done

to lessen the disparity in tuition
rates. ' ’

students couldn’t understand,
what seemed to be the unusual- ‘

ly large number of troubles with
invoicing and the cryptic corres-
pondence from the ﬁnancial aid
office. For these students, the

rest of the story may be particu- -

larly interesting.

II

The short break between the
winter and summer trimesters
was a period of rest for students,
but in Harrisburg the legislators,
surprisingly, were on the job.
(Around this time the General
Assembly had been taking num-

erous vacations.) The House had -

passed its form of the state re-
latedness bill. On the evening of
April 27, the situation looked
good to the average observer. The
nextmorning, however, the bat-

tle over the General Appropria.- . 

tions Bill and its affect on the
Pitt legislation made ﬁrst notice
in the papers. The terms of this
conﬂict became all too familiar
to the summer readers of the Pitt
News.

House Democrats on one side

 

 

and Senate Republicans on the. 

other side constituted the antago-
nists in the struggle. The Repre-
sentatives felt that the General
Appropriations Bill, which pro-
vides funds for the routine oper-
ation of state agencies and de;
partments, should be separated

into over 100 different bills( one

for each state agency or depart-
ment receiving funds). The Sen-
ators' demanded that the bill re-

main in the form of one bill co _-‘

ering every area.

(Continued from Page 7.)
 This, in itself, would not ordi-
 have caused concern. The
problem was that, under a 34-
yfear’-ola ruling of the state Su-
preme Court, the general appro-
priati_ons, in whatever form, were

toﬁbe passed before “non-prefer-
red” legislation. The $19.5 mil-
lion Univers. ty appropriation bill,
which would allow tuition to be
slashed to $450, was considered
'.‘non-preferred” legislation.

‘T Moreover, the Senate decided
_ that‘ it would not act on the en-
Qabling legislation for state re-
latedness until the Senate version
 the General Appropriations
Bill was approved.

Throughout the months of June
and July this stalemate continued.
It‘ seemed to students that the
General Assembly was always ei-
;, ther on vacation or using the
;;Pitt bills as political footballs,
levers‘ inethe game of politics.

_ ,3 _ Exasperation among students
jﬁincreased daily. Among adminis-
-I Ltrators, each passing day meant
~-less time to complete necessary
-{':;work and a great deal of, uncer-
tainty as to what the situation
would be when the inﬂux of stu-
dents began in the fall. The Stu-
-‘dent Aid office sent out state-
inents listing the amount of ﬁ-
nancial aid a student would re-
ceive at three different tuition
rates. In the housing olrices, the
initial concern was that there
it ould be a, great shortage of
‘rooms. A Director of Off-Campus
;_Housing was appointed to offer

help to the students who wouldn’t
be able to acquire a dormitory
room. As the weeks wore on,
however, housing olficials found
that the demand for rooms was
less than expected.

In admissions, Dean Jack Critch-
ﬁeld talked about making plans
to accommodate 400 additional-
frcshmen over the 1,600 previous
ﬁgure. At the end of July (with

the acceptance deadline two,

weeks away), only 1,400 had for-
mally accepted. The ﬁgure never
did reach 1,600.

In the long waiting period, stu-
dents did make some efforts to
expedite the matter. A rally,
sponsored by the Pitt News and
Student Government (SG), drew
State Sen. Leonard Staisey, Dem-
ocratic candidate for lieutenant
governor, Sen. Fleming, Rep. Ir-

. vis, and Rep. Harry Markowitz.

Statements came from Governor
Scranton, Rep. Joshua Eilberg,
House majority leader, and Sen.
Albert Pechan. Unfortunately, the
rally didn’t draw great student
support and Irvis blasted stu-
dents for their apathy.

The rally, along with extra
editions of the Pitt News, resolu-
tions by SG, petitions, and trips

to Harrisburg by students seem-
ed to have little eﬁect on the
men in the capitol.

When the ﬁrst action ﬁnally
did come it seemed to create lit-
the excitement. On July 27, a week
before ﬁnals, the enabling legis-
lation passed both the House and

amendments. The Senate had ac-
cepted the House plan of having

bill awaited only the governor’s
signature.

But, the most urgent problem
at this stage in the story, and the
reason why the passage of the
state relatedness bill itself caused
minimum excitement, was the
fact that the $19.5 million aid-for-
tuition bill was still immovable.
Time was running out. Some leg-
islators had promised that stu-
dents would get rebates if they
had to pay the full $1,400. This
was not satisfactory because less
than a year before the governor
had vetoed a similar proposal for
Temple University students. Fur-I

 

 

len, chairman o-f the House Ap-
propriations Committee, decided
to take issue with appropriations
to the state Welfare Department,
because the funds were destined
to be used to ﬁnance a prog. am
of birth control. Mullen seemed
determined to hold the General
Appropriations Bill in committee
until the money for birth control
was dropped from the bill.

Time had now run out. In-
voices had to be mailed. The
Board of Trustees decided to
stretch time, however, by billing

in—state students at rates of both ’

$700 and $250. The latter amount
would be paid if the legislature
acted before registration time.
Hopes were raised slightly when
a special House-Senate confer-

‘ence committee was established

to attempt a resolution’ 01 the
General Appropriations dispute.
"These hopes were, at long last,
justiﬁed. On August 8, the con-
ference committee announced a
settlement of the four-month old

Overwhelming

battle. The General Appropria-
tions Bill was to be approved as
the Senate had wanted. Mullen

got only a few concessions on the -

birth contol issue. The General
Appropriations Bill was passed
the next day. ‘

That same day, August 9. after
having waived a rule that would
have delayed passage another
day, the Pitt appropriation bill
passed easily and was sent to the
governor.

For students, the long, hot sum-
mer was over. For administra-
tors, there was paper work to
catch up on. Tuition reduction
‘for full-time and part—time grad-
uate and undergraduate in-state
students was assured. M

The Governor penned his name
to the tuition reduction bill on
August 23.

Thus ends the story.

The only question remaining
is, “Will everybody live happily
ever after?”

thermore, a number of students,
particularly freshmen, had based
all their_ plans on paying only
$225 on registration day.

fused situation, Rep. Martin Mul-

By MARY LYNN BROWN
When students of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh opened the reg-

I istration materials which they re-

ceived in August, they found that
the character of the University
hadichanged. The University had
taken on a “new look.” The Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh had become
state related.

State relatedness is the result
of many factors in the Univer-
sity’s past and in the state of
Pennsylvania’s plan for fulﬁlling
the needs for higher education
of its young people, but it is also
the acting out of an entirely new
concept in education. In a state-
ment to faculty -and students,
Acting Chancellor David Kurtz-
man said, “We think it is some-,
thing genuinely new on the edu-
cational scene.”

Dr. Kurtzman went on to ex-
plain the factors that led to Uni-
versity state relatedness. The es-
sence of his statement is con-
tained below.

In order to understand the fac-
tors which have led to the enact-'
ment of this new concept at the
University, one must look back
over the crisis at this University
last year and its causes, and link
that situation with the legislative
developments in Harrisburg over
the past few months.

P Last year, the ﬁnancial crisis
at the University was the result
of a complex series of causes dat-
ing back to the end of the Sec-
0nd World War. Not only did the
ﬁrst big baby boom begin after
the war, but more people began
to seek a higher education. These
babies are now causing the num-

particularly in urban areas. More
space, teachers, and equipment
are needed to accommodate them.

In the past two decades, sci-
ence and technology, have made
great advances. Again, more
space, teachers and equipment
are needed to accommodate them.

This is the dilemma of the
modern university, particularly
if it is a private, urban universi-
ty. Federal government subsidies,
philanthropy, and high tuition
costs combined are often not
enough to meet the ﬁnancial
strain caused by such rapid
growth.

The fact that, nationwide, about
60 per cent of college students
are enrolled in publicly support-
ed institutions demonstrates that
this dilemma is often solved by
the use of’ state funds, of state
relatedness; in Pennsylvania,
however, only 25 per cent of col-
lege students are enrolled in pub-
lic supported institutions. As Dr.
Kurtzman said, “The state has
always been able to rely on a
strong private higher education
system to fill its needs.” .

What, then, has changed? Why
does the state now need state re-
latedness of private institutions
to meet its educational needs.
The answer is again in the rising
number of students to be edu-
cated at the lowest possible cost.
The state had, according to Dr.
Kurtzman, “fallen behind in such
important areas of public educa-
tion service as providing low tui-
tion education.” I

Rather than build entirely new
educational centers, which would
require a tremendous expendi-

The Why of State Relatednessi
  It How It All Came About

found that it could use existing
institutions to help meet its
needs and, at the same ,time,
help solve their ﬁnancial and
growth problems. State re-
latedness was born in Pennsyl-
vania.

The University of Pittsburgh
is not a state university, but it is
not a private university. What
will this in-between status mean
to the students? Low tuition costs
to the in-state students and, even-
tually, lower costs to the out-of-
state students are the obvious re-
sults. But there are subtle re-
sults which will magnify through
the years. The ten-year gro-w-th
plan just completed which was
largelysuccessful in the analysis
made by the Ford Foundation,
can be. supplemented with new
buildings, new. grants, and an in-
creasingly larger enrollment.
These subtle changes are already
very much in evidence.

For the ﬁrst time in the past
six years, the University is op-

erating on a small surplus. This

does not mean that large debts
have been dissolved, but it does
mean that the crisis is over.
Three new departments have
been added to the academic pro-

grams: Computer Science in the .

Academic Disciplines, Metallurg-
ical and Materials Engineering,
and Microbial and Molecular Bio-
logy.

Engineering School Opens
New Educational Office

The University School of En-
gineering has established a new
Engineering Office for Continu-
ing Education and International
Programs.

Minor C. Hawk, assistant direc-

/tor of the University’s Know-

ledge Availability Systems Cen-
ter, will direct the activities of
the new office, designed to pro-
vide liason with industry and
government agencies.

and other government agencies
on matters relating to the admin-
istration of University engineer-
ing education programs abroad.
The University’s continuing ed-
ucation programs in engineering
include both short courses," de-
signed to provide engineers-in-
service with specialized skills re-
lated to their work, as well as
advanced degree programs aimed
at increasing through part-time
study, the over-all competence of

two years.

This is what state relatedness
has meant and will mean to the
University.

As Kurtzman said to the in-
coming class’ Sept. 6, “That’s a
fantastic amount of activity for
any University, but particularly
for one that only a year ago
faced a major ﬁnancial crisis.”

Deadline for ﬁ1in'g applications
for the Activities Fair has been
extended until Thursday, Sept.
15. Applications can be obtained
at the Student Union Desk. I

r.VVorks In Nationwide TV

 

By BILL CABIN

Vi‘ V There are many national-

4

ly- prominent people Whose
names are associated with
-the University of Pitts-

Jonas Salk, founder of the

 polio vaccine, football stars
1‘  Mike Ditka and Joe Schmidt,

artist Virgil Cantini, philos-

* opher Adolph Grunebaum, and
‘ anthropologist George P. Mur-

dock. We. now have a new cele-
brity. His name is Abe Wachs-
berg and he is the all-time mon-
ey winner on the quiz show “You
.Don’t Say.”

, Wachsberg, a senior psychology
ma-jor, went to Los Angeles in
May to work as a sales represen-

 7 . tative for Pram Laboratories of

California. He hoped to make

I" -, money in his summer job and

soak up some California sun-

 

 ,‘ shine at leisure. Instead his lei-

sure time allowed him to accu-
mulate $3,800 by sitting in an

wgair-conditioned television studio

guessing the names of famous
persons.

“I knew I could play the game
well from watching it at home
on TV,” said Wachsberg, “but it

* also took a. great deal of luck.”
 The show consists of two teams,

_ each composed of a celebrity.and

an audience member, and their
object is to guess the name of
designated famous persons. One

 401'" the members of each team re-

  

‘ ceives the famous name and gives

  his partner an incomplete sen-

 
 

 

 

 

ﬁtence. The partner must guess

the famous person by using the

_' missing word as his clue.

“Once I began winning people
kept on asking me how I did it,”
said _Wachsberg. “Often it was
just coincidence and after I got

 . rolling it seemed like ESP. (Ex-

tra Sensory Perception).” One
day he received the word Oliver
as a clue and correctly guessed

Oliver Cromwell as the famous
person. People asked him why

. he picked such an obscure per-

son instead of someone more ob-
vious like Oliver Wendell Holmes
or Oliver Twist. The next day he
received Oliver again as a clue.

4 His correct guess was “just by

coincidence” Oliver Wendell

Holmes.

Among Wachsberg’s partners
were comediene Pat Carroll, an-
nouncer Toin Kennedy, actor Cae-
sar Romero, and actress Tina
Louise. Miss Louise was Wachs-
berg’s ﬁrst partner and he lost
his ﬁrst game. Despite the loss,
Wachsberg went for six shows
before being eliminated by a sec-
ond loss.

 

“After the loss in the ﬁrst
game I was ready to settle for
the consolation prize of a trip to
-I-Ionolulu,” said Wachsberg. By
the‘ fourth show he had eclipsed
the old male record of $2,700 and
by his next-to—the-last appear-
ance he had surpassed the old
female mark of $3,200. His new
record of $3,800 _was the most
earned by any single contestant
in the 'show’s four year history.

Wachsberg plans to use the
money for medical school. Of
course, there is the income tax,
but Wachsberg says, “I don’t plan
on giving Uncle Sam a whole
lot.” Now with the beneﬁts of
summertime leisure stored safe-
ly in a bank, Abe Wachsberg re-
turns to classes ‘bearing a Cali-
fornia tan and the title of the
all-time winner of “You Don’t
Say.

By HOBART HARRIS

Friday, Sept. 16, is opening
night for the ﬁrst production of
the University of Pittsburgh The-
atre’s repertoire series, “The Fri-
day Night Theatre.”

The "University of Pittsburgh

3’ Theatre is beginning its ﬁrst year

at. the University. In the past,
dramatic productions were pro-
duced by an undergraduate group,
the Pitt Players. With most of
the money and direction for plays
coming from the University Dra-
ma Department, the new organi-
zation Cwas formed to combine
the talents of both. students an

faculty. ‘ —

Dr. Ralph Allen, assistant pro-
fessor of speech and theatre arts,
is director of the Theatre with
Bob Horowitz as undergraduate
president. Horowitz was elected
president of the Pitt Players last
spring, before the University The-
atre was organized.

The Friday Night Theatre is a
repertory series that will offer
between six and ten productions,
beginning with Jean Paul Sar-
tre’s No Exit, this Friday eve-
ning. In the repertore tradition,
each production will be repeated
several times during the term.

"Horowitz feels that such a sys-
tem allows “a "member of the
University community. to see a
production no matter what his
social or exam schedule.”

The repertoire system would
also eliminate the seating prob-
lem in the Friday Night The-
atre’s “home,” Studio Theatre
1001 CL, which can seat only 72
people at one time. “In the rush
for tickets for last season’s Sud-
denly Last Summer, Horowitz
said people were turned away.
We don’t want it to happen
again.”

Productions for the upcoming
season are Edward Albee’s The
Zoo Story, Samuel Beckett’s
Krapp’s Last Tape, Arthur Kop-
it’s Chamber Music, The Second
Shepard’s Play and The Fantas-
ties. The Fantastics will be the
ﬁrst musical produced at the Uni-
versity in ﬁve years.

Tickets for No Exit are now on
sale in 116 CL at 75 cents each.

Tickets can also be purchased at _

the door. Curtain time is 8 p.m.

General try-outs for the Friday
Night Theatre productions aswell
as Duchess of Malﬁ, the ﬁrst reg-
ular production of the year, will
be held today from 2 p.m. to 5
p.m. in Stephen Foster Memorial

Auditorium.

Reports

“Man-Made Enzymes:
A Goal for the Future”

Dr. Klaus Hofman, Common-
wealth Professor of Experimental
Medicine» at the University, has
reported at the annual meeting
of the American Chemical So-
ciety in New York that he has
succeeded in synthesizing all 20
amino acids in the “S-peptide"
fragment of the enzyme ribonu-
clease. He was optimistic that
within ten years scientists will
learn to make whole enzymes in
the laboratory.

In his paper, “Man-Made En-
zymes: a Goal for the Future,”
Dr. Hofman said that once sci-
entists can synthesize chemical
variations of enzymes, they will
be able to better understand nat-
uraly occuring enzymes. There is
a current theory that the absence
of such enzymes may cause gen-
etic defects.

Dr. Hofman pointed out that
synthesis of enzymes would be

Old Program Revived L

In Nationality Rooms

. “When Irfirst walked into
a Nationality Classroom as a

'.freshman,” said three-year

Nationality Room hostess

It .. Nancy Steinbach, “I asked

my teacher what the room

A was all about. He thought for a
.moment, then said, ‘I haven't

the vaguest idea.”’

VTo clear up “foggy” under-

‘ standings about the Nationality

Rooms, Mrs. Martha Anderson,
director of the Nationality Rooms,
is re-activating a program this
fall, designed to acquaint stu-
dents and teachers who use the
classroom with their history and
meaning. -

At the request of the teacher,
a Nationality Room Hostess will

come to one of the early class
sessions and explain the room to
the group. An open letter was
posted last Friday in each Liber-
al Art department inviting teach-
ers to call Mrs. Anderson at ex-
tension 211 and make arrange-
ments for a Hostess to visit their
class.

“This program had been dis-
continued in the past,” said Mrs.
Anderson,, “because the arrange-
ments had become too compli-
cated. We now feel that the
‘open letter’ will help stream-
line the procedures.

“If the program works,” she
continued, “each student will
have a new understanding o-f an
unusual classroom in which he
will spend’ so much time during
the next four months.”

Dr. George P. Murdock, An-
drew Mellon Professor of Anthro-
pology at the University, has re-

Hart Sees Tough, Rigorous Drills
As Groundwork for Huge Football
Rebuilding Chore In First Season

By GEORGE LIES
Tough could be the word
for Panther football this
Fall. Tough not in the way
of bad breaks, but in the
manner of new head coach

Dave Hart’s physical condi-

tioning.

The conditioning program
has taken its toll, especially
those not mentally ready for
Hart’s brand of football.

With only fifty—one play-
ers remaining from a squad
of 61 which practiced last
Spring, Hart took over a re-
building program where even
the blue prints were sketchy.
His injured number many
and his walkouts number al-
most as many.

The Panthers’ first game
is this Saturday *( against
UCLA) and they will be

Another Day

Are the Panthers as Bad

As Everyone Thinks?

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

lllIllll|ll|.“f‘

Dave Hart, the new Panther head coach, must be feel-
ing like the driver of the tenth car in a 20 car pile-up on
some ignoble freeway. No matter which way he turns or
how loud he shouts, there just doesn’t seem to be any way
out.

Hired last year to pull a big time football school out of
an embarrassing situation, Hart has been fighting ever
since to avoid being sucked down into the big time mess he

found waiting for him.

The mess wasn’t Hart’s making. The
blame has to be shared by the since depart-
ed John Michelosen staff and the Athletic
Department. In the meantime, words are
still flying and the major casualties are the
players caught in the middle.

Michelosen, in his days as head coach,
used to think that words were the scourge
of civilization. In contrast, Hart is fast
building up a reputation as one of the most
outspoken coaches in the Pittsburgh area.

His gift for conversation has won him a lot of friends.
It helped to bring in a freshman squad which should be the
nucleus of a Winning tradition again at Pitt in several years.

His quotes have also won him a lot of sympathy. After
the Fall scrimmage last week Hart said, “I don’t know how
a major institution can allow itself to fall into a situation
where its only has 47 bodies capable of playing football.

“You can be darn sure that we’re going to try to beat
the situation. In the meantime me and the kids are just
going to have to suffer because of it. We just don’t have
enough numbers or football players.

Then with a slight wink he pointed to anotherlocker
room and said, “But we’ve started something over there.”
It was the locker where the freshmen ‘were suiting up.

According to Hart, this year's team lacks everything
it. takes to bea good major team. There is no depth. The
offensive line is too small to push people around. Nobody
can break five flat in the 40-yard dash or 10.7 in the 100.
There are only 18 key men on the squad. The running game
just hasn’t seemed to progress past the standing still phase.

Hart has said that “the physical ability just isn’t
there.”

But there’s something there which makes you stop and
wonder.

Sane people just don’t go about every day beating their
brains out in practice if the possibility of winning is com-
pletely hopeless. In Hart’s words ‘.‘these boys are giving
125% every day.”

There is still a pride among Western Pennsylvania foot-
ball players and Pitt is still the bedrock of Western Pa.
football.

The dissension so evident on teams in the past has nearly
disappeared. This years’ Panthers are psyched up. They’re
convinced they’re going to surprise a lot of people.

The publicity has painted Pitt black this year_and for
some reason you get a sneaky feeling that this is the way
Hart wants it. For despite all‘his public utterances, he’ll
say in private, “I think they’re a better football team than
a lot of us think.” .

It’s Hart’s job to keepthe players keyed _up. Hopefully
his psychology won’t backfire. , \. ;_~.' ' -

short on manpower, but they

do have one advantage over"

the Bruins of Los Angeles.
“Pitt has a tremendous ad-
vantage,” Tommy Prothro,
head coach at UCLA point-
ed out, “they get to start
practice about a week earli-
er.”

Don’t look for a three-deep line-
up in the Panthers’ _ program.
There isn’t one. With specialists
and injured, Hart just doesn’t
have enough players to go
around.

However, for UCLA this Satur-
day, Hart does have in mind a
starting offense but it’s a trying
way to make "a start.

On offense, junior Bob Longo,
considered one of the ﬁnest ends
in the East, starts at the split
end position, while senior Mickey
Rosborough starts at the tight
end position.

Ed James, a senior, throws to
these two. Mike Elliot, also a
safety, plays behind James who
has seen only 15 minutes of ac-_
tion as a sub in the two past
years.

“James is throwing better
now,” Hart said, “and with Lon-
go and Rosborough catching
them, we’ll probably build our
attack around an air game against
UCLA."

Last year Longo caught 20 pas.
ses for 341 yards while Rosbor-
ough shows a career total of 48
receptions for 515 yards.

Along with James in Hart’s I-
formation backﬁeld are Dewey
Chester at tailback, Joe Jones or
lviike Raklewicz at fullback, and
Skip Orszulak or Chip Rife at
wingback.

“Chester looks like he can do
the job running for us,” Hart
said of the workhorse halfback
who clocked only 71 minutes last
Year. “And I can always go to
(Jim) Flanigan in short yardage
situations.”

Most of Hart’s top players "are
slated for defensive positions,
however. “I like to go with ex-
perienced players on defense, but
they must have speed,” Hart said.

Joe Curtin, who ran well in the
Spring intra-squad game, F1ani-
gan, the captain of the team;
Bobby Dyer, and .Bob Bazylak are
also expected to see some offen-

sive action aside from their de-
fensive work.

Hart appeared pleased with yes-
terday’s practice in which the
team drilled on goal-line defense
and UCLA’s play formation. “The
team is coming around physically
and the boys even showed a little

‘zip out there,” Hart said.

Again, as they do every prac-
tice, the Panthers drilled on
punts and kickoff formations.

This is unusual because most col- '

lege teams practice once a week
on kicking patterns. “If (Aldo)
Zo-rtea can come through for us
with those long punts, we’ll be
in good shape,” Hart said.

Zortea, who lettered two years
on the soccer team, along with
Frank Clark are the kicking spe-
cialists. Tackle Howie Heit kicks
placements.

offensive line is locked down _iI1
Hart’s mind, with the only posi-
tion giving him real trouble
the left guard spot where three
players, Andy Beamon, Dick Mi-
ale, and Ray Radakovich are
competing for the berth.

At the other guard position,
Dave Randour, who suffered an
arm injury in last Saturday's
scrimmage, should start with
Mike Coleman right behind him.

Ed Whittaker (right) and Howie
Heit (left) are the tackles with
Bob Taylor starting at center.
Whittaker, a sophomore, impress-
ed the coaches during Spring
drills and they installed him as
a starter.

Platooning as much as he can,
Hart will have to go with a half
dozen or more two-way players
because of the lack of depth and
experience.

    H-‘C SMOKER   — Wm. SEPTEMBERZI. I96

    

   

 

In an athletic department
where minor sports usually
go begging for players, soc-
cer players were dropped out of
heaven.

Restricted to one lane schol-
arship a year, Bemis has man-
aged to come up with the depth
that most coaches here only
dream about.

~Five starters are back from
last year’s team, which went to
the NCAA. Add to this several
other returning lettermen, and
a group of good sophomores, and‘
there is much reason for Bemis
to be optimistic.

The cast is headed by Art Rich-
ardson, team captain who opens
his third year at fullback. Also
returning are three other two
year starters, including Sal Ta-
vares at left wing, Jim Snyder at
fullback, and Vince Bartolotta at
halfback. . .

Adding depth are lettermen
Bill Zurzola, who will open at
fullback, Pete Snyder at rover,
Bob Racunas at right wing, and
Lou Cepanec at goalie.

Two new players have beaten
out lettermen for berths. Al
Traunsteiner, who lettered in
1964 but was_injured last year,
will open at either center, for-
ward or halfback. Dave Shim-
peno is a sophomore who can
play anywhere, but will probably
end up at halfback. The other

" spot is up for grabs.

Despite all this, Bemis is not
satisﬁed. After last week's scrim-
mage against 'the alumni, won by
the varsity 4-2, he said, “We look
a lot better but ‘we still have a
long way to go. We lost our con-
tinuity, _and I had to switch for-
mations to get the ball moving.”

This switch,’ replacing a half-
back with another lineman, was
highly successful against the
alumni, and B-emis intends to
use it more this year.

Still defense and not oﬂfense,
says Bemis, is the key to the
team's success. “Our attack will
come if we have a solid defense.

SAL TAVARES
One of last year’s leading scorers.

We need more co-ordination in
our fullback line. Right now this
is our weakest point.”

A bruised heel suffered by Zur-
zola has hampered any attempts
to correct this weakness. He has
been unable to practice at all,
but Bemis expects him to see ac-

Saturday.

Shimpeno, who suffered a leg
injury against the alumni also
is expected to be ready for Frost-
burg.

So, the booters should be at
full strength physically. Mentally,
it is another story, according to
Bemis. “I’m afraid they are tend-
ing to overlook Frostburg and
look ahead to West Chester and
Michigan State. I

' West Chester and Michigan
State are two of the top ten
teams in the country. It will be
these two games which decide
the booters fate. Still, not over-
looking Frostburg, “They came
on strong at the end of last year,”
says Bennis, “and they should be
real tough this year, especially at
home. We will have to play real
well if we expect to beat them

Cubs Run UCLA’s Offenses;
Win Respect for Themselves

By ROY JACOBS
Just as any superstructure needs a firm foundation, a
rebuilt football power relies on a strong freshman unit to
inspire a comeback. Both head coach Dave Hart and frosh
coach Seve Petro feel this year’s group is the start.

Although unable to start re-
cruiting until last January, Hart
is pleased with his 33 prospects.
However, “we are in no way

satisﬁed,” added the coach, “be- ‘

cause there is much more-to be
done. We’ll have a better group
this year simply because we're
already ahead of last year.” Last
weekend the coaching staff and
interested alumni scouted over 30
local high school games.

The more immediate concern is
this ‘year’s squad and its four
game schedule. Currently, the
freshmen have been running
UCLA’s offenses and defenses
against the varsity. Neither Hart
nor Petro seems to worry about
any adverse effects on the play-
ers. I

“They’ve sacriﬁed a lotof team
practice to ‘be UCLA,’ but every
boy stood out in the job he was
called to do,” complimented Pe-‘
tro. Hart added that V“most schools
use the same practice only they
say they don't for recruiting pur-
poses. We work them right in
with our drills, and theY’Ve 31‘

‘ ready won respect from the var-

sity.”

The frosh’s ﬁrst game_ isn’t un-
til October 14 when they go to
West Virginia. The coaches plan

to work with them particularly 

on Fridays with extra work on
Mondays and Thursdays when
the varsity has light practices.
Petro, who compared this group
to the 1953 freshmen who went
on to the Sugar Bowl, was im-
pressed with the boys’ unity and
the speed of the backs. Hart
mentioned that 12 or more of
the freshmen could help the var-
sity this year.

- Pi Lams Win;

Beat ZBT In

  Tight Game

The intramural softball season
opened last Monday with a good
showing by an underdog and the
crumbling of a former power
The results of three fraternity A
league games were Delta Sigma
Chi 6, Delta Tau Delta 6; Sigma
Chi 6, Sigma Alpha Mn 4; and Pi
Lambda Phi 4, Zeta Beta Tau 2.

ZBT, in the tougher A League
for the ﬁrst time, gave Pi Lam a
tough ‘ﬁght and it was a close

‘ :7 game all the way. Pi Lam held

a 3-2 edge until the top of the
seventh when catcher Marc
Schwartz scored from ~ﬁrst on
Mike Olscher’s double and a Zeeb
throwing error, On their last
licks, ZBT staged a near rally,
but Shelley Bratman’s pitching
cooled them off as they left two
men on base at the end of the
game.

After their first game last
year, the Sammies looked unstop-
able. Now it looks as if nothing
will make them go as Sigma Chi
had no trouble downing them,
7-4. Last year’s third place team
couldn’t hit the ball out of the
infield and their own infield
could not hold onto the ball. Ear-
ly inning errors by the left side
of the Sammy inﬁeld led to most
of the Sig Chi runs.

Stan Smokler and Bill Goren,
who relieved Smokler in the ﬁfth
inning, pitched adequately, but
their ﬁelders fell apart behind
them. The Sig Chi’s hitting was

Illllllllllllllllllll I IIIIIII:IllIdlllllllllll'IllII!IllllllllllilllliIllllhllllllllllhlllli-Ii~I:.IIIIII

not too much better than the
losers as ﬁelding decided the
game.

The winners almost threw the
game away in the same way that
the Sammies did. Two bobbled
pop ﬂies and hits by Chuck Cash-
er and Roger Kleid led the losers
squeeze out four runs in their
half of the sixth inning. Sig Chi
pitcher Terry Hyman snuffed out
this rally and had no further
trouble with the weak Sammy

stop sparked the ﬁeld behind Hy-
man. Kleid, Barry Roth and Len-
ny Baxt proved to be the only
standouts in the Sammy field.

In the afternoon’s most excit-
ing game, the Delta Sigs scored
four runs in the last inning to
turn what had been a 5-2 deﬁcit
into a 6-5 win over the Delts.
Chip Fabio’s pitching and Jim
Beck’s three-for-four hitting paced
the victory.

 

Flanigan  Defensive Signals

(Continued from Page 18.)
can’t say ‘well I made that tac-

kle, let somebody else make this
one.’ Once you stop trying it’s
only you who is going to get hurt.”

Despite the fact that one mis-
take on defense can break open a
ball game, Flanigan refuses to
feel the pressure as defensive sig-
nal caller.

“I think I learned a lot from
last year,” says Flanigan. “I real.
ly tried last year and I think I
knew my stuff. But a lot of the
times last year the defenses just
weren’t basically sound. They
lacked common football sense.
Defense is a great deal more than
just knocking people over.”

“This year our strategy is sound
er. We have more blitzes, slants
and plugs. Roughly 35 in all. I
think we have an advantage over
a lot of teams and I think we’re
going to surprise a lot of people."

Flanigan feels that if he’s hurt,

, somebody could easily step into

his place. But he’s wrong. _If Pitt
is going to surprise anybody this
year Flanigan is going to have to

be on the ﬁeld pulling the strings . 

of strategy and spirit. Without
Flanigan the fragile structure of
this year’s Panthers would crum-
ble even faster than the greatest
pessimist expects.

Harriers Run, Run, Run Under Banner;
Three Returning Lettermen

The cross-country team will not
be taking in too much scenery
during its tours through Schen-
ley.Park this season, basically be-
cause they’ll be too tired to look
around during their workouts un-
der new head coach Jim Banner.

Two years ago, as interim coach
Banner led the harriers to an
undefeated season.

During« the past three weeks,
Banner has tuned the barriers

1 into top physical condition by

means of two workouts a day.
each 10 miles. Fran Shor and
Frank _I-Iandleman are the only
two year lettermen returning
from the undefeated 1964 cross-

country team. The remaining
three positions on the squad will

be ﬁlled by one-year letterman.

Larry Hubner, Paul Gregg, and
Ken Lewton. The ﬁrst alternate
is Roger Hally.

Banner is reluctant to make
any predictions because if any
injuries occur to the starting ﬁve
or one alternate the harriers.will
be in trouble. Banner did say
that every member of the team
has been giving 100 per cent of
his ability. “If hard work means
success, then the cross-country
team will deﬁnitely be success-
ful.” ,
