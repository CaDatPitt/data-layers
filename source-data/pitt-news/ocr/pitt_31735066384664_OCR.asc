Area Redevelopments Discussed

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
' Pitt News Staff Writer

Efforts to alleviate traffic and
housing problems in Oakland were
discussed last Wednesday night by
area residents at a forum sponsored
by Oakland Directions Inc. (ODI) at
the First Baptist Church on Bayard
Street. -

Redevelopment options wer
presented by Don Carter and David
Lewis, representatives of Urban
Design Associates, a consulting
ﬁrm-hired by ODI to explore and

' formulate goals for renovation in

_ Oakland.

residential areas have become

corroded because of revisions made . p
to suit student housing. They added A

that a redesigning of the Oakland _
residential area must be done in -

order toavoid the development of a

- ‘ ‘student ghetto.”

Possible solutions suggested by
Carter include student housing
projects in Hazelwood and the
creation of a special student
residential area “close to campus. ”
Carter added that much-needed
dorm expansions by Pitt compound
the problem.

. “The University could do~with
some two, three, or four thousand
additional housing units and still be
short,” Carter said.

Several solutions to the trafﬁc
problem were presented by Lewis.

' Alternatives discussed included:

- . Return two-way trafﬁc to Fifth

 Redirect incoming Bates Street
traffic from the parkway to the

Bigelow and Craft Avenue areas.

Create_ a central bus loop

, circulating through Oakland.

Lewis added that a Forbes Avenue

subway system could be considered
as a long-term project.

Carter and Lewis directed much
of their planning ideas on two areas
of redevelopment.

First, they advocated repair of
“ﬁxed” zones. These are areas
where redevelopment is not pos-
sible (institutional and commercial.
areas), but building renewal and
strengthening of the existing
environment can be considered.

Second, “areas of opportunity”
+—vacant land and underutilized
buildings-—where opportunities for
large-scale development exist.

‘ Community residents formed five
task. forces-—-transportation, com-
mercial, residential, institutional,
and public safety—to consider the

‘Urban’ Design Associates’ propo-

sals.

Wecht Lectures On 
Kennedy Assassination

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht lectured last week on the
ﬁndings of the Warren Commission
report on the Kennedy assassina-
tion. . ~

Wecht, a nationally acclaimed
forensic pathologist, called the
assassination of the nation's 35th
President a conspiracy rather than
the work of a single man as the
Warren Commission stated in its
report.

The Commission was created
under‘ a special order of the late
President Johnson in September,
1964, and has since come under
heavy ﬁre from members of the
medical, scientific and political
communities for its alleged pro-
cedural inaccuracies.

In an attempt to paint a clearer
picture of what led to the
assassination, Wecht reconstructed
several of the major events of the
day. ,

Wecht claimed Kennedy, who at
the time was proposing strong
civil-rights legislation, made the
trip to Dallas despite warnings from
Sen. Adlai Stevenson. Stevenson
had experienced tension and
hostility in Dallas weeks prior to the
Kennedy trip. The afternoon of the
President’s arrival large amounts of
anti-Kennedy literature were distri-
buted in the Dallas streets by a
group financed by the son of the
Texas millionaire, H.L. Hunt.

According to Wecht, the 1964
election was on Kennedy’s mind,
and he made the trip with hopes of
gaining popularity in the South.

At 12:30 p.m. on November 22,
1963, Kennedy, Vice President
Johnson and Texas Governor John
Connally embarked on the first leg
of a Texas trip.

The motorcade in which they
were traveling at a slow speed
passed the Texas Book Depository
as shots rang out, striking»Kenn'edy
in the neck and Connally in the right
side.

Another bullet delivered the fatal
blast to Kennedy striking him in the
lower rear skull. ‘

At that time, "secret service

Anti-Nuclear ProtestorsMorch Downtown  

By TOM M. KUKUCKA ,

Pitt News Staff Writer
Some 150 demonstrators pic-

0 keted the United States Steel and

 

Gulf buildings downtown last
Saturday, protesting Rockwell In-

'temational’s and Gulf Oil Corpora- '

tion’s involvement in the production
of nuclear weaponsyand materials.

Termed ‘ ‘Mobilization. For Survi-

val,” the‘ protest, coincided with; .
much larger demonstrations at the,
Rocky Flats Nufclear ‘plant i.xiéar»."‘
Denver,‘ Colo.-, »_ and_‘the-:-- Nuclear ‘_
Reprocessing plant at 5. _BarnWel1‘s-‘ 5

S.C.

Rockwell manufactui-e's ‘plu-
tonium triggers for nuclear war-

heads at the Denver facility at the

rate of 3 to i1o_pt-;r—;I‘d‘ay, and Gulf
owns» 25 percent_'g‘,of‘1-A the ‘Barnwell
plant, , which —  designed ' to .‘ store

spent fuel from nuclear plants
throughout the world.

Both plants have been criticized
as unhealthful and unsafe.

The protesters gathered at the
Steel building at noon, carrying

" signs and shouting slogans such as
_ “three bombs a day and Rockwell
leads the way,” and “no more

billions for nuclear destruction.”

 ’ Then they proceeded to the Gulf

"building and ﬁnally to a rally at

 Market Square where a small folk

-group entertained and speakers
preached against nuclear energy
and the neutron bomb.

Two Pitt teachers, Dr. John
Townsendof the physics depart-
ment, and writing instructor Liane
Norman were guest speakers. Also

speaking at the rally were Richard

Hayden of the“_Friends of the Earth
and Paul Garver from the Pennsyl-
vania Alliance-for Jobs and Energy.

Townsend described the effects
of an atomic bomb, saying a bomb
dropped on Oakland would destroy
the city in a half-minute.

He said ' a bomb dropped on
Oaklandwould “vaporize the sheet
metal from autos; in Market
Square" in seconds.*f‘~ ;,

‘ ‘After 30 seconds, ._it’s_ all over, ”
Townsend b. ‘said. ' ; *“Pittsburgh is
dead.”.  j .  1  , .

Norman‘ said .Ain_erica- should

trated on other sources; '

“There is f more ., and more

of radioactivity.,T’ _-Norman ‘said. A
“Experts "tellt;ns~, we‘ must rely on
nuclear energyfto: siistain your level

of living. They said the same thing
about the Indochina war.”‘

Garver advocated solar energy in
place of the “so-called peaceful
atom.”

‘ ‘We have to make sure there are
no nukes in war and also no nukes in
peace, ’ ’ Garver said.

Hayden also stressed the need for
a stronger committment ‘to the
development of solar energy,
calling it “the world’s long-termed
energy source.”

During the walk to Market
Square, the protestors passed’ out
leaﬂets and petitions to the
downtown crowd.

The Mobilization for Survival is a
national coalition of labor, religious,
peace", J "environment and social-

justice groups.

agents swarmed over the Presiden-
tial limousine and rushed the
wounded men to Parkland Hospital
where the President was pro-
nounced dead 35 minutes later.

. According to Wecht, immediately
following the pronouncement of
Kennedy’s death, the hospital staff
physicians were ordered out of the
treatment room by military per-
sonnel.
‘ ‘serious procedural error. ’ ’

Later that day, an autopsy was
performed on Kennedy by doctors
Wecht called “military physicians
with absolutely no forensic train-
ing.”

“This is why the whole thing
became such a debacle,” Wecht
said. “These physicians also had
non-medical ofﬁcials in the autopsy
room issuing orders to them as to
what they were and were not

. permitted to do. This is not a matter

of hearsay but a matter of record.”

Wecht added that in the course of
the autopsy several pieces of basic
evidence were ignored, such as the
appearance of a bullet hole in the
President’s back with no bullet to
match. The bullet was later
discovered on the floor of " the
emergency room of Parkland
Hospital by a maintenance man who
claimed the bullet fell from
Kennedy’s stretcher.

Wecht also said the physicians
disregarded the wound in Ken-
nedy’s neck because it had been
enlarged surgically by doctors in an
attempt to clear an airway for the

President, making it less visible as

a wound.

It was at this time the
“single-bullet theory” was form-
ulated, whereby one bullet alleged-
ly wounded Kennedy in the lower
shoulder, made a U-turn in the
body, wounded him again in the
neck, then struck Connally.
Entering Connally’s body, the
bullet supposedly exited from his

chest and ﬁnally came to rest in his _

right thigh. ’

Wecht said he and other forensic
pathologists stood amazed that such .
a “physically and scientiﬁcally

disclosed to the public.

“It would be impossible for a
single bullet to have behaved in this
manner, and to have caused this
much damage in two men,” Wecht
said. But with the single-bullet
theory, there is Oswald acting alone
and without it we have a
conspiracy. ’ ’

Wecht said the proof of a
conspiracy ' in the assassination
entered the picture when the
ballistics and trajectory reports on
the shots fired were studied.

Reports, compiled separately
from those of the Warren Commis-
sion, state that under testing by

second pauses between shots.

‘ ‘This proved impossible because
it was found that even the best
marksman will take a minimum of
2.3 seconds to get a second shot off”
Wecht said. “If, in fact, Oswald
would have fired at Connally from
the exact position that he fired at
Kennedy, the shot (with a speed of
2,000 feet per second) would have
completely missed the Governor
because of the movement of the
motorcade. ’ ’

Although Wecht did not say who
might have been involved in such a
conspiracy, he did focus on the

Wecht said that Jack Ruby was
“a man for all seasons,” who just
weeks before the assassination had
been involved with smuggling guns
in Cuba.

In closing, Wecht asked the
audience to reﬂect on the elections
that have passed since the Kennedy
assassination. '

“In 1964, JFK was almost
assured reelection,” he said, “as

party nomination in 1968. In 1972

support of large powerful unions
such as the United Steelworkers.

New Jersey Casino Opening Contested

'3)’ The Associated Press

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J .—Resorts‘ International chairman James M.
Crosby used unusually strong language yesterday to attack those
opposed to the planned opening of the ﬁrstcasino by Memorial Day.

On another issue, the detailed “rules of the game,” considered
by some to be crucial to the future tone of Atlantic City’s c asinos, are
likely to be decided when the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission meets here today.

Crosby said statements calling for a delay in the opening by ‘Sen.
Garrett W. Hagedom, R-Bergen, and the Rev. Howard J. Abbott of
the Citizens Casino Surveillance Coalition were “a desperate effort
on the part of self-serving individuals to malign the company.”

Hagedorn said lastweek that the coalition, made up largely of
opponents to the 1974 and 1976 casino referenda, is compiling
information on the Florida-based conglomerate that could result in
the denial of _a temporary permit and a permanent license.

Abbott said his group wﬂl present the informatiori at a hearing in
Trenton next Wednesday on Resorts’ application for a temporary
casino permit. The coalition has asked that the hearing be delayed
until June 15.

Speer Defends U.S. Steel's
South African Operation

By The Associated Press

.MINNEAPOLIS-—'I'he board chairman of United .States Steel
yesterday defended the ﬁrm’s operations in South Africa, winning
shareholder support in rejecting a proposal to halt industrial
expansion there.

The resolution offered by the Episcopal Church’s Domestic and _

_Foreign Missionary Society called for the corporation to withhold

any expansion by Big Steel while the South African Government '

practices “a legally enforced system of racism known as
apartheid.”

But chairman Edgar B. Speer told some 400 shareholders at the
annual meeting that correcting that country’s social problems
“cannotbe accomplished overnight.” He said “progress” made in
the past,four to ﬁve years was “unbelievable, and I’m'pleased with
it.”

Speer also said United States Steel depends on South Africa for
vital raw materials, including ferromanganese, without which steel
could not be produced.

Begin Celebrates Israeli Birthday
At The White House

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—President Carter and Prime Minister
Menachem Begin celebrated Israel’s 30th birthday yesterday as
Congress began considering a proposed three-way jet ﬁghter sale
that has heightened tensions between the United States and the
Jewish state.

The occasion for Begin’s visit was a White House reception
marking the American observance of the anniversary of the
founding of Israel in 1948. Carter invited about 1,200 rabbis and
other Jewish leaders to join him and Begin at the White House
reception. ’

The Israeli leader also planned to hold private talks with Carter
concerning the impasse in Middle East peace talks. But it was not
immediately known whether the pair would discuss ‘C__art,er’s plan to
sell jet ﬁghters to Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as to Israel.

Begin spent Sunday in New York where he attended ceremonies
marking the Jewish uprising in the Warsaw ghetto during World
War II, and he planned to fly to Los Angeles for another anniversary

Off-Campus Housing

Any student who has tried to find off-‘campus housing near the
Pitt campus knows a severe housing problem exists in Oakland.
Apartments and rooms for rent within 10 minutes walking distance
of the campus are rented as fast as they become available. Every
year, students encroach on family residential areas in North
Oakland and South Oaklandmore distant from the University.

The students bring to those fringe areas greater congestion with

‘ the accompanying problems of less java.ilabl’e parking, more noise,

traffic problems and physical neglect of rented ~-properties. Private
homeowners in the fringe areas suffer when the worth of the
houses in which they have invested their li-fe’s savings drops sharply
after students invade their neighborhoods’. 4

A consulting firm hired by,}()al;.land.“Directions Inc. has now
developed several alternative ahswershr, to control the expansion of
student housing onto North Craig?‘ Street. and other streets once
dominated by privately owned.homesa. , , .

One solution to the problernt.,su{g'3gests a special district for stu-
dents be established in Oakland .wit_li Atwood Street the boundary

I between student housing and private housing.

This answer seems completely unsatisfactory, because there are
simply not enough buildings in that portion of Oakland to accom-
modate Pitt students. Unless developers plans’ to replace existing
dwellings in the student area with fa high-rise project, this policy
--would only aggravate of f-campus housing shortages. The founding
of a student “ghetto” with such_.a‘bo_rder is especially repulsive.

Any high-rise project wouldfprobab-ly be unaffordable. Past
development projects have proven ‘private developers are not
willing to develop housing since itgis unprofitable, and there are no
longer overabundant public funds.‘ available for such building
projects. ,    _

A second proposal calls for,»-increasedlgstudepnt housing in the

Hazelwood area. Though it”  ‘,“sp”rnewha’t distant from Pitt,
Hazelwood is less congested than’éll¢land," thus offering a better
site for more student housing.“  ‘Pitt students already live in
the area, but the lack of a direet;,'.bus.’-.?route between Hazelwood
Bﬁlililltl lllllllllts §t8Wl:tl Bf stlit:l.ettt:’l$lVstellilng in the area.

This second alternative seems the better choice. It inconvenien-
ces students who must live in'lH‘_azelwood, but there is no other
feasible answer to the dilemma. ’ 

To speed the adoption of thislpiolicy,» Pitt should intercede and
push Port Authority Transit to establish a Hazelwood to Oakland
bus route, the first step toward development of Hazelwood.

Letters to the Editor

Misunderstanding of Course for TAs

I must point out a serious
misunderstanding in your editorial

entitled “GSO Unionization,” in ,

The Pitt News of April 17. The
editorial discussed the amount of
credit to be given for “a course all

teaching assistants and teaching

fellows must take next year.”
There is no such, course. The
subject of the statements. made at
the FAS-GSO meeting was OFD
200, a service course that the Office
of Faculty Development is provid-
ing, free, for teaching assistants
and teaching fellows next fall: a
once-a-week course in university-
level teaching, to be ‘held on
Thursday afternoons from 4:30 to
6:30 p.m. It consists of a
carefully-planned, but individual-
ized syllabus, designed solely to

help those who feel the need for
some further guidance in teaching
their classes here at Pitt. ’

1 would hope that the offering of r
credit might be an incentive to TAs ‘

to take the course. For that reason, I

brought the credit issue to the FAS E

Graduate Council for their consid-

eration. But the course is purely if

voluntary. It was designed in
response to teaching assistants’
own expressions of need, and it is
being offered as a service to them.

There are many who will want to

take it, credit or no credit. Enroll- ,

ment must be limited to 30,
however, on a ﬁrst-come, first-
served basis. Graduate students
who are interested in taking it
should check with their depart-

ments or call extension 5692 for
information. i

g -"It is regrettable that this course,
dsfsigned. only to help TAs, was
misinterpreted as an administration
requirement and used as a pawn in
union/nori-union discussions. The

.Ofﬁ_ce. of Faculty Development is

d¢di€8’£edgto serving the needs of
P1.tt’s__ teaching personnel, both
faculty and graduate students. Next
fall's course» in University Teaching

‘is only; one .of several programs

designed togphelp people throughout
the University who want to improve

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Most of the world has been
skeptically scrutinizing the accords
designed to eventually establish
black majority rule in Rhodesia.
Many observers question whether
the agreement will actually lead to
majority rule. Bryon R. Hove’s
dismissal from his post in the
Justice and Law and Order
Ministries confirms suspicions
about the sincerity of the white
minority’s support for majority rule.

Hove was fired from the
Government because he called for.

These comments seemed to be
legitimate suggestions by Hove,
who headed the Justice and Law
and Order Ministries jointly with
Hilary G. Squires, a white. Prime
Minister Ian D. Smith felt
otherwise, claiming the statements
violated provisions in the constitu-
tional accord which bar political
interference in the police, army,
judiciary, and the civil service.

’ Smith and other white leaders
first demanded that Hove retract his
statements. When he refused,

Hove was ejected from his
Government position.

Smith’s action suggests he has no
intention to establish majority rule
in Rhodesia. Instead it appears he
plans to use the transition plan to
make it look like Rhodesia is moving
toward majority rule, while black
Rhodesians are actually being
prevented from gaining any real
power.

Such behavior by the white
minority can only aggravate the
already tense situation in Rhodesia.
Black popular sentiment expressed
by demonstrators seems totally in
support of Hove. If the Government
refuses to reinstate Hove, this
popular support could force black
leader Bishop. Abel Muzorewa to
withdraw from the transition
Government. Without Muzorewa-
the only black leader in the present
Government with popular support

‘—the transitional Government

becomes a facade not truly
representing the black Rhodesians‘
concerns.

If Muzorewa withdraws from the
Rhodesian Government, the inter-
national consensus that the present
constitutional accords are meaning-
less is supported. In such an
atmosphere world opinion could
easily turn strongly against the
present Rhodesian government.

The United States cannot afford

Besides harming our strategic

reluctance to become further

States’ willingness to support
human rights at all times, and opens
us to charges of racism. If the State
Department takes steps to reinstate
Hove and reopen negotiations, this
doubt can be prevented and a long

averted, which would beneﬁt not
only Rhodesians and Africans, but
the world as well.

Kline Publicly Discloses
Election Contributions

By Tne Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Lieutenant
Governor Kline ﬁled a voluntary
report with the state yesterday,
listing contributions since Feb. 1 of
$333,880 to Kline’s campaign for
the Democratic gubernatorial nom-
ination.

An accompanying new release
from Kline’s campaign committee
said the ﬁling was evidence of the
candidate’s candor, and it scored
“other candidates who have made
sporadic disclosures. ’ ’

Kline’s major opponents, how-
ever, former state Auditor General
Bob. Casey and former Pittsburgh
Mayor Pete Flaherty, have also ﬁled
such voluntary reports, and each
has scheduled at least one more.

the release from line's committee
makes much of Kline’s committ-
ment to ﬁle the reports quarterly.

Flaherty’s staff ﬁled a report
March 16,’ showing contributions
dating to Dec. 15,1977, of $115,000.
A report ﬁled April 17 detailed
additional ‘contributions of
$172,848, for a total of $287,848.

Casey’s people ﬁled a voluntary
report in April‘, showing contribu-
tions since the previous November
of $324,000. Casey’s campaign
official, Tom Brislin, said yesterday

the total now is “in excess of
$600,000,” with another report
slatedfor the week before the may
16 primary.

If Brislin’s updated estimate is
accurate, Casey is winning the
fundraising battle. Kline’s camp is
reporting a total of ‘$588,218 raised
since Kline’s committee was
established in April 1976.
Flaherty’s $287,848 total makes
him a distant third.

The Casey war chest, however,
won’t do the candidate much good if
voters confuse him ‘on the ballot
with Robert P. Casey of Allegheny
county, seeking the nomination for

lieutenant governor, or Robert J.

Casey, seeking Democratic nomina-
tion in the 18th -Congressional
District. i i ’

 toavoid the possibility of such
"confusion, Casey ‘had requested‘

that “former auditor general?’ be
listed on the ballotbehind his name,
but Commonwealth Court last week
rejected the request.

A Casey campaign spokesman
said yesterday the name issue will
not be pursued further.

In. campaigning yesterday, Fla-
herty was interviewed by several
newspapers in suburban Phila-
delphia, then attended a fundraiser,

Clemente’s Widow Loses
Appeal on Negligence Suit

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The Supreme
Court left intact yesterday a
decision barring baseball star
Roberto Clemente widow from

ollectin dama es for her hus-
E33 ,2 fdti sea 1}} an aiiaiaas
crash.

The justices turned down Vera
Clemente’s appeal contending that
the federal government should be
liable for damages in allowing an
unsafe plane into the air.

Clemente, one of baseball’s
greatest talents as a longtime
outﬁelder with the Pittsburgh
Pirates, was killed Dec. 31, 1972
when a DC-7 plane he had chartered
to carry relief supplies to earth-
quake victims in Nicaragua crashed
shortly after takeoff from his native
Puerto Rico.

All persons aboard—Clemente,
two other passengers and two crew
members—were killed. Mrs.
Clemente was joined in the suit by
relatvies of the two passengers who

accompanied her husband, Angel
Lozano and Francisco Matias.

They noted that the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) just
three months before the crash had
ordered all employees" to keep
constant surveillance of charter
plane operators to ensure their
planes were safe.

The surviving relatives’ lawsuit
charged that federal employees
should have inspected the airplane,
discovered its lack of airworthiness
and thus prevented its takeoff from
San Juan International Airport.

A federal trial judge in San Juan
ruled that the aircraft was being
operated illegally by an uncertiﬁed
owner and that it was overloaded by
4,193 pounds at takeoff.

The judge ruled that the federal
governmentuwas liable for money
but the ruling was overturned by the
United Stated Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit.

onerotes Paper

in Disclosure of Secret Proceedings

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON—Newspapers
cannot be criminally punished for
publishing truthful information
about secret Governmental pro-
ceedings, a unanimous Supreme

Court ruled yesterday.

The high court struck down a
Virginia law making it a crime to
report about a state judicial
commission’s conﬁdential investi-

gations into judges’ ﬁtness to hold

office .

That law was invoked against
Landmark Communications, pub-
lisher of the Virginian-Pilot news-
paper in Norfolk, after the paper
published on Oct. 4, 1975, an
accurate repot that the state’s
Judicial Inquiry and Review Com-
-mission had studied complaints
against a domestic relations court
judge.

“The article published by
Landmark provided accurate factual
information about a legistively
authorized inquiry. . .and in so doing
clearly served those interests in
public scrutiny and discussion of
Governmental affairs that the First
Amendment was adopted to
protect,” Chief Justice Warren E.

8 Burger wrote for the court.

The court’s vote was 7-0.

Justices Wlliam J. Brennan Jr. and
Lewis F. Powell  did not
participate in deciding the case.
Although the controversy in-
volved a newspaper report, wording
in Burger’s16-page decision clearly
extended such First Amendment
rights to broadcasters as well.

At the outset, Burger described
the legal issue as “whether the First
Amendment permits the criminal
punishment of their persons who
are strangers to the inquiry,
including new media, ‘for divulging
or publishing truthful information
regarding conﬁdential proceed-
ings.”

Landmark Communications, af-
ter the Virginian-Pilot article
appeared, was indicted, convicted
and ﬁned $500 under the now
invalidated state law.

The Virginia Supreme Court
upheld the conviction and ﬁne,

, ruling that the law made any breach

of secrecy in the justice.

That reasoning was rejected
yesterday.

“Neither the commonwealth’s

interest in protecting the reputation ~

of its judges, nor in maintaining the
institutional integrity of its courts is
sufficient to justify the subsequent
punishment of speech at issue
here,” Burger said.

The court’s ruling does not
protect from criminal sanctions
commission members, staff mem-
bers or witnesses who appear
before the commission and take
pledges of secrecy in the event
those persons are found to give out
information about the closed
proceedings.

older man who he feels should really
be put in a home for the aged.

assists her when she masterminds a
dramatic flight plan to thwart her
Uncle Frank from placing Grandpa in
a home, is played by David
Stambaugh.

McCartney Too Innovative in

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and
his group, Wings, are innovative in
their music—as their new album,
“London Town,” shows. But most
of the songs on the LP go overboard
in innovation——the tangent on

A which they travel misses the mark,

downgrading the quality of the
album. _
‘Wings aims for the catchy,

toe-tapping tune—with a curve or
two thrown at the listener in almost
every song. “London Town”
features half-simple melodies and
half-attempts at staggeringly dif-
ferent concepts in songwriting—the
use of such instruments as the moog
and ﬂageolet (a tin whistle), the
melody changes. For the most part,
both halves fail.

The first four cuts on the album
are the best. In both the title track

Paul McCartney could do better than “London Times”

and “Cafe on the Left Bank,”
Wings sings Beatles-like composi-
tions with a modernized rock sound.
The lyrics are the same seemingly-
nonsensical-but-full-of-meaning
lines the Beatles were famous for in
the mid-1960’s, but the music has a
1978 beat and utilizes the moog and
drums well.

“I’m Carrying’ ’ is the only ballad
on the LP, and is a nice change of
pace. The guitar work sets a warm
mood for the smooth vocals by
Denny Laine.

“Backwards Traveller” is the
first try at hard rock on the album. It
contains very few lyrics, and lets
Wings tout its playing prowess with
.moog and good guitarwork-—not
harsh, but blending tones.

Unfortunately, that is the last
prime cut of the LP. The rest of the
songs are, at best; average.

“Children Children” and “Girl-‘

friends” are the worst works on the
disc. ‘ ‘Children’ ’ tries to be a sort of
toddlers’ song with a rock base. It
gets caught in the middle, and is
confusing to the listener.
“Girlfriend” is a horribly simplistic
song, with lyrics disappointingly
devoid of any meaning. McCartney
is capable of better.

‘ Side one ends with “I’ve Had
Enough,” another hard rock
attempt with a chorus so monotone
it’s irritating.

Side two is worse. “With a Little
Luck,” the top-40 hit currently
making the rounds on radio, is
catchy, but the instrumental parts
are much too simple to sustain the
listeners’ interests’ interest. The

moog is featured here, and makes.

the song as enjoyable as it can be
without a motivating score.

A barrage of innovation follows.
“Famous Groupies” takes on a
circus-like air that provides a
different angle to a common theme.
But the song, although different in
music circles, is laughably cami-

valistic until it verges on the
ridiculous.

“Deliver Your Children” and
‘ ‘Name and Address’ ’ are hard-rock
tunes that are bland and lifeless.
“Address” is an Elvis Presley-type
rock ’n roll offering with McCartney
utilizing his“‘boogie” voice. It’s a
nice try at an area of music
synonymous with the late Presley-

but not up to the same standards. I

“Don’t Let It Bring You Down”

 

Denny Laine provides smooth vocals." on “I’m Carrying”

'London Town’

features a little singing by Linda
McCartney—-Paul’s wife. That is an
unfortunate mistake—she sings
off-key and can’t seem to hit high or
low notes in this rock song.

‘The album ﬁnishes with “Morse
Moose and the Grey Goose,” a
gimmicky rock song that quickly
changes into a sailor ditty with a
rock backup. Very unique,
innovative stuff, but too gimmicky
to be enjoyed.

However, last week, it was

As for the Germans’ acceptance
of the program, the producer said
the German audience will probably

Americans did.”

“Uﬁe §iir-‘vey stiawea that 50

Dan lust Continues To Have a Good Year

By MARIA SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

For high jumper Dan Goodyear, it

was a repeat of last year’s Penn
Relays, except for a happier ending.
For distance runner Dave Mc-
Donald, it was the opportunity to
break more Pitt records, his third
and fourth of the year.

7 ” These two Panthers turned in the '

eam’s most impressive showings at
the 84th annual Penn Relays, held
last week at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Franklin Field.

A year ago at this meet, Goodyear
cleared seven feet but tied another
jumper. He was eventually
awarded second place, losing on
more missed attempts.

Last week, Goodyear made sure
that wouldn’t happen again,
clearing 6-8, 6-10 and 7-0 on the ﬁrst
three attempts. Again, another
jumper cleared seven feet, but this
time the Pitt athlete won on misses,
beating some 80 jumpers.

gmtszcnonaid failed to win the 5000

meters, but his time of 14:06 was
within 20 seconds of North
Carolina’s Ralph King, who won the
event. McDonald’s clocking broke
senior Panther Mel Boyd’s record
and also qualiﬁed him for the NCAA
championships.

McDonald also set a new

three-mile record. His 13:36 time
shattered the record held by former
Pitt all-America Jerry Richey.

Taylor, with an effort of 47-7, and

Other notable performances were ShiPP€n (43-9). Willis Shannon

(49.7), Bud Cooper (48.4) and Keith
Leckenby (48.4) combined for a
3215.4 in the event, their best time
of the season.

Dan Goodyear clears 7-0 en route to winning the-high jump competition.

A week earlier, Pitt participated

in the West Virginia Relays against

15 schools and clubs. Freshman
Randy Bailey, running the steeple-
chase for only the second time in his
life, won the race with a meet record
of 9: 19. Goodyear was second in the
high jump (6-10), as was pole
vaulter Gene Roach (14-6). The
two-mile relay of Rich Moore, Mel
Boyd, Roger Winstanley and Tom
Herrmann (7:43) were also second-
place ﬁnishers.

Shot-putter Mile Wallace was
third in the competition (49-10), and
the Shippen-Shannon-Cooper -
Leckenby mile relay won third-place
honors with a time of 3:18.3.

Pitt will compete against two
Eastern powers, Penn State and
Maryland, Saturday, in a double-
dual meet. Coach Mike Agostinella
said the distance races and the pole
vault should be areas of great
interest.

“We hope to do good things in
several of these events,” Agostin-
ella said. “Penn State in particular
always has strong distance runners,
and I think Gene (Roach) will have
some good competition in the pole
vault.”

The meet, to be held i11 State
College, will be the Panthers’ last
chance to prepare for the May 12-13
Pitt Invitational at Pitt Stadium.

Today Is Commencement for Several Panther Seniors

   

  rounil-‘cho'icés.”" ‘ " ‘ 

Before John Majors arrived and the language
requirement left here, Pitt was listed somewhere in
the vicinity of Alaska A&Q, Mississippi Mudlands
and, of course, Posvar Wesleyan on pro football
scouts’ list of places to go. If a third—string Pitt punt

 pper went in the 14th round because the New

‘rleans player personnel director liked the kid’s
middle name, Pitt followers considered it a decent
year. And if said snapper lingered at the Saints’
camp long enough to finish his first quart of
Gatorade before he was told to leave, Panther fans
grew ecstatic and ready to face another 1-10 season at
the Stadium. '

But that was before Pitt began to produce national
champions, all-Americas and NFL rookies of the
year. The 1978 college draft, which began at just
about the time today’s edition of The Pitt News

..‘began to hit wastebaskets all across campus, is of

‘nsiderable interest to Pitt fans, who could see as
many as three of their Panthers taken before the first

round is completed.

The prime Panthers are Matt Cavanaugh, Randy
Holloway and Bob Jury, and, while they are not up
to the standard set by this year’s three “monster”
picks—Texas runner Earl Campbell, Florida receiver
Wes Chandler and Ohio State brick wall Chris
Ward—each was mentioned more than once as a
good bet to go in the first round by a group of player
personnel directors contacted by The Pitt News
yesterday.

 “Chandler, Ward and Campbell are the'g’uaran.- ' A

teed“ super players,” said one team’s top talent

‘ evaluator, “and after that there is a considerable

droip. ,‘ But. those three guys from Pitt should be first-_

. . .
‘.5. ,"l'.vx

. .t "  was

      

 

“We definitely gave Cavanaugh a lot of con-
sideration,” said Kansas City’s Les Miller, owner of
the draft’s number-two pick. “But we have other
positions to worry about, though I really do think

he’s the best of the four or five really good quarter--

backs coming out this year.” ,

 

The Pitt News has learned that Kansas City after
watching Houston select Campbell, will select
either Ross Browner of Notre'Dame or Art Still of
Kentucky. Each is a defensive end.

, New Orleans, possessor of pick No. 3, will select
Chandler; the New York Jets will likely follow by
taking Ward, -a massive guard; Buffalo may make
Oklahoma State runner Terry Miller the fifth player
to be chosen. '

And so it will go until San Francisco, choosing
seventh, becomes the first team to consider taking
Matt Cavanaugh, who will be the first Pitt player
drafted (Cavanaugh is holding a press conference‘ at
noon today at the home of his advisor and wealthy
friend, Joe Massaro). ' '

“We asked Cavanaugh‘ to"-come. out here for a

physical,” said 49ers’1p’layer personnel; director

available by the time the seventh pick rolled around.)
We’re still interested in him, though. It’s just that we

9 probably wouldn’t go after a quarterback with that

kind of pick. We have a list of seven people—I plan
to take the highest available player on that list when
our turn comes up—but no quarterback is on that
list.” ‘

That must be a disappointing to Cavanaugh’s
backers at Pitt; as late as yesterday, they were con-
fident the 49ers would take Cavanaugh if he were
available.

That makes Cavanaugh’s probable destination
Cleveland, though the 49ers’ White ended a conver-
sation by cautioning that “Joe Thomas (the San
Francisco general manager) is very, very high on
Cavanaugh and ‘you shouldn’t be surprised if we end
up with him.”

The second Panther to go should be Holloway.-

“He had a poor senior year,” said. one personnel
director, “but that won’t scare many people off. ’ ’

“Holloway is a good pick,” agreed Kansas City’s
Les Miller, the director of personnel for the Chiefs. V
“He’s put on weight since the season was over, and
it’s good, hard weight.”

The opinion of the scouts yesterday was that
Holloway would go midway through the first round.
Look for the New England Pats, choosing 14th, to
make Holloway their pick.

The third Pitt player with first-round potential is‘

Bob Jury. ’

_ “Jury and Kenny Greene (Washington State) are '_
U the (two best safeties in the country,” said Mike
Hickey,_ personnel director of the Jets. "‘He’l-l go .

player Bob Gruber last week was

. an-xious to leave Pitt and go home

for the summer.

But,~as anxious as he was, the
Greenville, Pa., native stayed in
Oakland so he could get further
treatment on a gimpy ankle that
kept him out of most of spring
practice.

‘‘I’ve. been working on the

A ankle,” Gruber said last week. “In.
~ fact, they’re going to give me some

workouts to do this summer that

should really help strengthen it.”

Gruber ' hopes the workouts,
consisting of running and weight-
lifting, will help liealthe ankle in
time for Fall camp when the 6-5,
245-pound junior is expected to
battle both Kurt Brechbill and Ed
Gallagher for a starting job at left
offensive tackle.

‘ ‘I’ll do anything to help the ankle
heal,” Gruber said, referring to the
injury incurred during the first week
of spring practice. “It’s sort of
disheartening to have an injury like
this, but it’s just one of those things
you have to accept. There's nothing
you can really do about it.”

Playing defensive tackle at the
time, Gruber was running along the

line when offensive tackle Mark
May fell’ on his ankle, rupturing the
tendons. Gruber laughs at the
thought of the injury not occurring
had he. not talked the Panther
coaching staff into letting him play
the first week of spring practice at
defensive tackle instead of across
the line, as originally planned.

“I told some of the coaches that I
wouldn’t mind playing defensive
tackle for a week or two before
moving to offense,” continued
Gruber, who was a starting

would be better to be injured in the

Gruber is already anticipating the

By JIM PANE

Pin News Staff Writer

The best way to eulogize Len Barcalow, Pitt’s 69-
year-old hockey coach whose bout with cancer ended
last week,.1s to describe, through a team practice, the
relationship he had with his players. That relationship,
in essence, was what ‘Len Barcalow was all about.

Barcalow-sat, lacing his skates in the Civic Arena
dressing _I‘00m,_ and joked with his team prior to the
practice in which he was to make ﬁnal player cuts
before his fifth and final season opener. He looked
slightly, uncharacteristically, troubied_

_“I hate like hell to cut some of these guys,” Barcalow
d. They all try hard, they all want to make this

 club, but what the hell can I do? You can only dress so

many for a game. We have our first game coming up
next week, so tonight’s the night something has to be
done?’

Barcalow often expressed similar concern for his
less-talented players who saw little game action. Mem-

dues; and Barcalow believed in each one’s right to play;
he was torn between that and the desire to win.

 the ice, Barcalow had his Panthers loosen up by
spririting around each faceoff circle in succession. One
 flew by his coach at center ice and said, “Come
on,.§IL?enny, why don’t you join us?”
.. Barcalow laughed. “Hell, I did this stuff 40 years
ago.” .
.; The subsequent warm-up drill began to annoy the

p _ .tt’ coach. Barcalow’s prescribed lines of four skaters

hever turned up with four skaters. He stood patiently,
hands in pockets, occasionally spewing a small wad of
spit onto the ice, before: _
"“I said four!” His voice echoed. off the Arena
ceiling..“One, two, three, four!” . - ‘
Barcalow skated down the line, pointing harshly to
where each numbered player should be- Lining them up
for another try, he blew his whistle, but, again, never
four.
“Four!” he stopped them again. “F-O-U-R!”
Geez, you can’t even count for Petesake.” v
Later, Barcalow ordered a clockwise stroll around
the rink. Many players, however, began in the opposite
direction. ‘

 said clockwise!” His sandpaper voice‘ was still I

going strong. “You can’t count, you can’t tell. which
way the hands of a clock go, you’ll never be able to play
hockey!”

“‘ Barcalow’s Relationship With Players Made llim Special

 

Leonard C. Barcalow, Pitt's hockey
coach, died in St. Francis Hospital
April 26 after four months of
deteriorating health. He was 69.

Barcalow came to Pitt in the fall of
1973 when the hockey club was
beginning its third year, and amassed a
ﬁve-year record of 73-26-6. In his first
three years behind the bench,
Barcalow, whose teams never experi-
enced a losing season, led the Panthers
to consecutive Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Hockey

titles before Pitt retired from the
league in 1975.

A former president of the Pittsburgh
Amateur Hockey League, Barcalow
coached many levels of hockey and was
an NHL Players’ Association Hockey
School instructor for the Chicago Black
Hawks.

Barcalow, who worked as the
assistant recreation activity director at
Allegheny County’s North Park, is
survived by his wife, Grace Wimer

stood at center ice while the Panthers supposedly
displayed a fast—action drill of skating, passing and
shooting at the goalie. Barcalow was instead treated to
a showing of sloppy passes, tumbling skaters and
missed shots. He commented to Montgomery on each
ﬂub.

“He’ll never make the team,” he’d say, or, “That
klutz, he’s no good.”

“Two hands, Larry, you’re not in no spaghetti
joint...Rick, stay in the net——you’re going way out of
the crease like a Chinaman...Put it on the tape...At-
tababy...Now you got him...Thatsa way to chop his
butt...Whoaaa...Good job...Get ’im, get ’im...Score!”

With Barcalow, the team’s pace quickened. The
skaters flew, latching on to bad passes, making even
more good passes—on the tape. The goalie, oc-
casionally beat by a great shot, reached out for some
nice saves, and he was staying in the crease instead of
venturing off like a Chinaman. Barcalow was pleased.

“These guys are really great,” he told Montgomery.

“Watch Larry,” he said as Larry Gallick picked up a
pass andscooted toward the netminder. “He’s going to
score here, watch.”

Gallick’s shot went wide, but Barcalow smiled
anyway.

“These guys are something else,” he said.

Praise was always one of Barcalow’s trademarks.
Through his many successes at Pitt, credit always went
to his players. V, _

“These guys are the best,” he said after the previous
season’s final game. “They definitely have class. Hell,
any dummy can .coach this team-—that’s why I’m
here.” ,

Barcalow called a five-minute break, during which he
skated (and how people marveled at the way a man his

"and explained some of the things the kid was doing
wrong. The player didn’t question his coach but just
listened, nodding his head.

Barcalow resumed practice with a scrimmage. Again,

he became displeased. Players kept leaving their
positions, a wrong for which Barcalow often scolded

his team. _ _ _
“Alex, stay the hell over here!” he said, pointing.

“You’re gonna get beat some day if you keep leaving

my head, you’re gonna get beat.”

“But, Lenny,” the player retorted, “I have to break
somewhere.”

“Well, break me some bread next time,” Barcalow
said. “Now stay in your lane.”

The team chuckled. It was just enough to break the
monotony of a practice.

“That’s one great thing about. Lenny,” a starter said
on the bench. “He can get serious, but still keep you
loose. He’s a great guy; there just wouldn’t be a show
without Lenny.”

Barcalow had them scrimmage further before he saw
that time was growing short in this last practice before
final cuts.

“O.K., we’ll make them run some sprints, then I can
break their little hearts,” he told Montgomery.

“We’ve got a game coming up,” he said, talking
more to himself than anybody. “That’s the way it’s
gotta be.” p A

And that’s the way Barcalow was——a blend of
gruffness, sympathy and one-liner wit. He may have
been a strange mixture of many things, but one fact
remains—Barcalow was hockey.

“Hockey was his whole life,” Grace, his wife, poin-
ted out.

DUQUESNE, Pa.—Run to victory
in a marathon one day. Back to a
steel mill for the 3-11 shift the next
day.

That’s the whirlwind world of
Marty Sudzina.

In Philadelphia recently, the
26-year-old laborer at National
Tube’s Duquesne Works outdis-
tanced some 500 runners to win the
prestigious Penn Relays marathon
for _the second time in three years.

The 130-pound Sudzina com-
pleted the 26.2-mile run in
2:23.51—more than four minutes
ahead of runnerup Mark Ogden of

wfeorgetown University.

   Sudzina’s Marathon Victo

“It was a great day to race,”
enthused Sudzina, who has put
himself back in the picture for a
berth in the 1980 Olympics.

“The temperature was about 70
degrees and the sun was shining. I
just felt like running. It was like a
stroll in the park, the race was so
easy,” related the young bachelor,
who won the same marathon in 1976
but ﬁnished seventh last year.

Sudzina admitted his effort was
buoyed somewhat by a telephone
call from the U.S. Olympic
Committee a few days before.

“The Committee wants me to
begin training again,” he said.
“They’re trying to get me a job
where I can go into a good training
routine, not like what I have to do
while I’m working in the mill.”

Sudzina’s daily routine, coupled
with a strength-sapping laborer’s
job in the mill, boggles the mind of
many observers.

‘ ‘I still run my 25 miles a day,’ ’ he
reported. “I get up at 5 o’clock in
the morning to run. Then I go back
out and run again about 12:30 p.m.
And I go to work at 3 p.m.”

I .. , ‘Tuesday, May 2, 197s—rm: PI’-IT NEWS-l’age:;1"=7

Surely, a weaker man would
crumble -under that routine. Not
Sudzina. .

“I’m ‘back on the road to Moscow
now.” says Sudzina.

It wasn’t that way a few months
ago. Sudzina was about to give up
marathon running.

“It was getting to me,” he
admitted. "‘I didn’t know which
way to turn. When the Olympic
Committee called, that turned me
around. That gave me new hope
that I can still make it big.”

Yet working in the steel mill tends
to get Sudzina down, and he admits
it’.

ry Buoys Olympic Hopes

“It’s not the best place in the
world to work when you’re trying to
stay in racing condition,” said
Sudzina, whose father was a track
star at the University of Pittsburgh.

“But it’s a job I need. And those
people have really been wonderful
to me. Really understanding my
problems.”

Sudzina plans to sit back and wait
for mvrtations to big marathon
races.

“I ,1,mow the invitations will
001116. Marty said. “When ygu

Wm 3 big race. the invitations
always will come.”

 Opening Loss Would Have Decimated Bullets-Grevey

PHILADELPHIA—Kevin Grevey
intimated that had Washington lost
Sunday’s‘ game to the Philadelphia
'76ers, it might have -shot the Bullets
right out of the National Basketball
Association playoffs.

The Bu-llets, lost a four point lead
in the ﬁnal five seconds and had to
go into overtime to upset the
favored Sixers, 122-117, in the ﬁrst
of a best-of-seven Eastern Confer-
ence playoff ﬁnal. Doug Collins’

3

21-foot jumper at the regulation
buzzer tied it at 109.

“It would have beena serious
blow if we lost that game,” said
Grevey, whose 26 points helped the
Bullets win here for the first time in
more than three years.

“It would have been terribly
demoralizing,” he explained,
“because they weren’t sharp. And,
if we couldn’t beat. them when they
weren’t sharp, it would be tough

doing otherwise.”
But the Bullets prevailed,
outscoring the 76ers, 13-8, in the

A ﬁve-minute overtime to wrest the

home court advantage from Phila-

s delphia. The Bullets got what they

came here for——at least a split in the
two games at the Spectrum even if
they lose Wednesday night.
Grevey recalled that at the half of
Sunday’s opener with the score tied
at 47, he had said to himself, “Hey,

these iguys don’t look sharp.
They’re not going to be able to turn
it around 24. minutes. We really
have re. .chance to win this thing.”
Grevey,T7a I second-year player

‘from Kentucky who averaged 15.5"

points during. the regular season,
said he was very pleased for the
Bullets’ Wes Unseld and Elvin
Hayes.  T

The 32-year-old Hayes scored 28,
(nine in the overtime) grabbed 18

rebounds and blocked six shots.
Unseld collected 10 points, .10
rebounds and handed out -.;four
assists. I Ei_'1_
“He (Unseld) is so underrated,”
Grevey claimed. “Maybe he’ll get‘
some recognition if we win 
thing.” 
Sixers coach Billy Cunningham
said his team had to forget Game 1,
go over the ﬁlms, take out the
mistakes and correct them.

/( I.-/Iri/.-/zvr/V/>'rw I’u!;r’ In’)
time our second choice comes up.”

The -Steelers, much of whose defensive backfield
either stinks .or’—is crazy, are said to be considering
Jury;as.avfirst-round choice.

After ,l’ury_,, Hollowav and Cavanaugh comes Pitt’s
second group, Tom Brzoza and Elliott Walker.

Brzoza,"-4 'par:-il,’ all-America at both guard and center at .

Pitt,Fdrew (more publicity during his college career
but tWa-ljker. .a fleet and sturdy runner, draws more

notice from the men with the bucks.

‘,‘Brzoza could go behind Walker,” said Hickey of
New York. ,“Walker’s a good football player . . .
he’ll play for someone in this league next year.”

Brzoza’s size—he was quick, not huge—scaredj  
some scouts, but he is carrying 252 pounds today and

it would not be insane to look for him to be chosen

5 near Walker in the third or fourth round.

The other Panthers looking to be drafted are J .C.
Wilson at cornerback (small but talented), Willie

Pitt Seniors Graduate to NFL Draft

Taylor at wideout (unheralded but with Crazy 

p for fingers), LeRoy Felder (unheralded but respected‘
_ _ and steady) and Randy Reutershan (whom the p
’ , ’Steelers are considering as a late-round pick because .

of their ailing special teams). '

 I » “This is a bad year after the first few outstanding —
" 7 -«prospects are gone,” the personnel directors agreed1.;;',’

“But it ain’t that bad.” ; ._
And that’s bad news for Pitt’s third-sting 

snapper. He’ll have to buy his Gatorade at A&P,fitv_ '
