University
Cancels
CarRace

By MIKE BUCSKO

Pitt’s participation in a national
college driving competition reached
a dead end when the university’s
involvement was vetoed by the
Office of Student Activities.

The event, the National Collegiate
Driving Championships, is cur-
rently being held at 69 other colleges
and was supposed to take place at
Pitt yesterday, according to Ed
Solomon, president and founder of
Campus Dimensions. Campus
Dimensions is a private, Pittsburgh-
based company coordinating the
event.

Solomon said Pitt was the only
school out of a possible 70 partici-
pants, including MIT, Stanford and
Harvard, refusing to take part in the
competition.

Solomon said he began coordi-
nating the event last month with

Greg Wilson, president of the Inter- '

fraternity Council, and said he
thought he had the green light before
the university informed him that it
was cancelled late last week.
Solomon blamed the office’s direc-
tor, Andy Smith, for the
cancellation.

“Student Activities put a
whammy on the thing,” he said.

The event is sponsored by the

Chrysler Corporation, the Sports

Car Club of America, and the
National Safety Council and is free

to all participants. Solomon said‘

Chrysler donated a Dodge Daytona

-Turbo car for the competition,

which allows participants to drive
around pylons arranged in a figure-
eight course. He said the course
stresses accuracy over speed because
the car is locked into first gear and
National Safety Council representa-
tives control a “kill switch” to pre-
vent injuries if the car happened to
run out of control.

A winner chosen at each college
nationwide is flown to Daytona
Beach, Fla., at the expense of
Chrysler and will compete against
representatives from other schools
for over $20,000 in prizes, Solomon
said. Prizes include a $5,000 scholar-

. ship and the use of a Dodge car fora

year for first prize and a $3,000 scho-
larship and the use ofa car for a year
for second prize, he, said. Contest-
ants only needed a valid Pitt ID and
driver’s license.

“The only place we’ve had a prob- _

lem is my hometown,” Solomon
said. “It's kind of embarassing.”
The event was to have taken place
on Bigelow Boulevard between Fifth
and Forbes Avenues. Wilson app-
lied for and obtained a permit to
close off Bigelow from the city's
Department of Public Works, two
weeks ago in the university's name.

Businesses Profit From Strike

By PAM CYGRYMUS ' B

As the Giant Eagle strike goes into
its 17th day, students and residents
in the» Oakland-Squirrel Hill area
are learning to cope with the incon-
venience’ of not having a super-
market in the ‘area.

For example, senior citizens in the
Squirrel Hill area have really been
inconvenienced according to Reva
Horn, supervisor of counselling for
the Jewish Family and Children Ser-
vices’ department of aged.

She said that her organization
provides transportation for the
elderly in the area, regardless of
creed. Before the strike, shoppers
were taken to the Giant Eagle on
Barth St. and given two hours to do
their shopping. They were also able
to go to the post office, drug store
and kosher food store, all in the
same area as Giant Eagle.

Two trips must be made now, one
to shop and one to run other
errands, Horn said. The group takes
the senior citizens to a Foodland to
shop, but there is “really nothing else
around it,” she said.

Dawn Isaac, of Husser-Powell
Family Services, a part of the South
Oakland Citizen's Council, said that
there has been an increase in the
number of people requesting trans-
portation to the grocery store. She
feels this increase is due to the Giant
Eagle strike. The service is usually

requested only-by the eld_erI.y..,and ,, I

those who cannot get to the store on
their own, but now it may be needed
by others as well.

Julie'H/ill, executive director of
the YMCA on campus, said that
although no requests have been
made,’ transportation to go food
shopping could be provided through
the YMCA. The program could be
conducted in a fashion similar to
that currently used to take students
to Century III and Monroeville
Malls.

‘If you think about
it, my store has
become the I
second-largest in
the South Oakland

area.”
—Nick Mancini

The convenience stores along
Forbes Avenue, Sheetz, Stop-N-Go
and 7-1 I, all agreed that their busi-
ness had increased. Mary Jane
Brucker, an assistant manager at 7-
11, said that business had increased
only “slightly” and credited it to the
location of the particular 7-1 1.

College students _will go for the
convenience, Brucker said, so 7-! l’s
volume is ‘”more constant. She said
that perhaps a 7-11 in a residential
area might experience a larger
increase in sales. V V .

Nick 'Mancini of Mancini’s,
located in South Oakland, said that
his business had “increased substan-
tially.” He said that sales have
increased by $200-$300 a day, an
increase of about 30 percent.

“We are nota small neighborhood '

store,” Mancini said. ‘‘We’re only
small in size.” He said he thinks that
Mancini’s is a major alternative to

-the Giant Eagle, especially in the

South Oakland area.

Mancini added that he is trying to
make his store more convenient to
shoppers by staying open a little
longer, opening earlier, carrying
extra inventory, and running more
specials. '

He said that his store “fills the
void" left by convenience stores
because he sells fresh meats and
poultry. ~

“If you think about it, my store
has become the second-largest in the
South Oakland area,” Mancini said.

Tim Sperry, Membership Educa-
tion Coordinator of the Semple
Street Food Co-op, said that sales at
the co-op have increased since the
strike, but the long term effects on

Committee
Rejects
Reprint  
Request  

By PEGGY FERRI

The Student Goverment Board
Elections Committee rejected a can-.
didate’s request asking for a reprint
of election ballots. The committee
decided against Avery Abrams’
request, citing that his slate, the
Coalition for Cable T.V. in the
Dorms, does not constitute a slate
according to election code.

The code definition states that ~

“the name of a candidate with the

name of a slate may appear on the.

ballot by the ..candidate’s written
request at least 48 hours before the
election.”

Abrams petitioned the committee ,

with the argument that a slate can be

«defined in the singular, allowing one i

candidate to run on the ticket.
Abrams is opposing Monday’s
decision on the grounds that it com-
pletely disregards the committee’s
recommendation from the emer-
gency meeting the night before.

. “The decision is invalid,” Abrams ‘
said. He“further explained that

Monday’s meeting did not consti-
tute a proper quorum because there
were only four board members pres-
ent, three of whom were on the Elec-
tions Committee. Those present

were Jim Brady, MichaelJoano.w, ._ y 

Judy Townsend, and Kathy Brown.

“I didn-t’t~ ask for-any of this [pub-.» » ‘B

licity],” he added. “I was given an

incorrect election code and the real I
. issue here is whether the administra-‘

tion was involved.” ,
The code which Abrams says he

was givenstipulated that a candidate‘

must provide 48 hours’notice before
his name can appear on a ballot with

the name of a slate. Updatediver-' I

sions of the code, however, indicate

that the candidate must provide a -

week’s notice.

The committee attributed this to a
clerical error and concentrated
instead on the definition of the word
“slate.” The definition which the
committee used said that a slate is a
list of candidates. ‘ "

According to Brady, who was at
the meeting, Avery, defended his
position “very strongly.” The ques-
tion was whether the coalition could
be considered as a slate rather than a
slogan. . - .

“The defintion of slate is vague,
and a revision of the code could be
necessary,” Elections
member Michael Joanow-said.

Abrams contended that the
administration is involved in SGB
elections, which he said means that
the SGB has no power or credibility.

Abrams went on to say that Brady
told him the ballots were going to be
reprinted until Assistant Director of
Student Activities Joyce Giangarlo
cancelled the order. g

If he loses the elections, Abrams

said he is looking into procedures to » ‘ '

challenge the elections. He added he

has checked into this procedure by ‘

meeting with Activities Director
Andy Smith.

“[Smith] suggested that I bring
the matter up. before the Student
Government Board Judicial Board,”
Abrams explained, “but [because ‘it
has been so long since there has been
a case like this,] there is no such
thing.” ' G

Other candidates have expressed
their own opinions on the incident.

Board candidate Bob Kramer said
that he felt the issue was a bit trivial,

but agrees with the committee’s deci- _

sion not to reprint the ballots.
“[Publicity] has not been unfair. If
anything, it has done as much harm‘

I as goodj” he explained.

No Report Filed Onunsolved Fire

By ANA PUGA

No official report has been
filed on Wednesday’s deliber-
ately-set fire at the Pitt-owned
building used for student hous-
ing at 305 Atwood St., according
to Pitt campus police.

The university's director ofthe
Office of Property Management,
Charles Graham, said he does
not intend to file a report with
campus police because he
believes they have already been
advised of the fire.

“They [campus and city
police] would have, had to have
been there and been advised of it.
The city police and the university
police have a relationship; they

units go out, police units go with
them — always," Graham said.

Walt Waters, assistant direc-
tor of ‘campus’ police, disagrees.
“There was no report filed. Our
buildings is somewhat limited, as
kinds of buildings is somewhat
limited, as opposed to a dorm or
something like that."

Waters said that normally
campus police are not notified
when city police are called to a
fire.

No citation for fire code viola-
tions was filed against property
management, according to fire
inspector Ralph Lange.

“Because they replaced the

_ doorknobs and smoke detectors

immediately, no citation was
filed,” he said.

Acting battalion chief Roy.
Pelke said that someone had
fixed the doorknobs in the build-
ing after the fire began but before
the fire inspectors arrived. The
property management mainte-
nance worker who first noticed
the fire when tenants complained
of smoke in the hallways was not
available to respond to Pelke’s
comment.

Pittsburgh fire captain Tho-
mas Hitchings said he will file an
official report with the city
police.

“There are no suspects, but
there is a record that the fire was
an incendiary fire. If anything
comes up later, we’ll pursue it.”

Pitt Hosts Jazz Seminar

By CHELLE J. HRITZ

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Jazz Seminar will celebrate its thir-
teenth year with a concert, Nov. 5, at
the Carnegie Music Hall.

The Jazz Seminar has attracted
many creators of the international
jazz forum. As Dr. Nathan Davis,
director of jazz studies at Pitt said,
“Each year the group of musicians is
hand-picked and we've had every-
one here.” ‘

Past Jazz Seminars have hosted
such performers as Terro Pollard,
Dizzy Gillespie, Ron Carter, Grover
Washington Jr., Monty Alexander
and Sonny Rollins, among many
others, who played before a fasci-
nated crowd of students, faculty and
jazz fans of Pittsburgh. '

Davis was responsible for the
original Jazz Seminar, back in 1970.

This year’s group includes French
tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin,
trumpeter Woody Shaw, Eric Gale,
bassist Rufus Reid, pianist Kenny
Barron, percussionist ldris Muham-
mad, Africa’s traditional percus-
sionist-Komla Amoaku and Pittjazz
studies director Nathan Davis, on
soprano saxophone.

According to Davis, Johnny Grif-
fin is coming “direct from Paris”and
has recorded in Paris and Germany
where he is—very well known.

Davis has worked with Woody
Shaw in -Paris for three years.

He accompanied pianist Kenny
Barron in Kansas City in December,
as well as Rufus Reid in Chicago.
Also, ldris Muhammed is on Davis’
most recent album Faces of Love.

Davis said, “This is the first time
that this specific group has played
together. However, each person
would know the music of the other
person somewhere down the line.
They have probably worked with
one of the other individuals.”

The practice on the day of the con-
cert will be the first time that the
entire group will play together.
According to Davis, the quality of
the musicians provides that a min-
imal amount of practice is needed.

The cost of this year’s seminar is
$17,000, said Davis. He believes
musicians are attracted from all over

the world because of the great talent -

reputation. of this event.

Historically, the city of Pittsburgh
has been inﬂuenced byjazz. It was a
convenient resting place for musi-
cians when they travelled from New
York to Chicago, and it has become
an establishment for musical knowl-
edge to the people of Pittsburgh.

Davis said, “The city is now con-
sidering giving us an ongoing grant
because it [the Jazz Seminar] has
become a city institution.

“The publicity might help him in
the election,” board candidate Pam-

damaged his credibility.?’ She added.

that publicity similar to that given
this incident would have been bene-
ficial for the other candidates
because they, like Abrams, would
have an edge over the other
candidates. 0

Candidate David Pikovsky said
he does not feel the Coalition for
Cable T.V. in the Dorms is a valid
one, and added that he also agrees
with the committee’s decision.

  Opinion

Unexpected

On this, the first day of elections for the Student Govern-
ment Board, some people might wonder if the process is
intended to provide Pitt with student leaders or practicing
politicians. .

Take, for example, an incident involving board candidate
Avery Abrams and the Elections Committee. Abrams
wanted to run on a slate called the Coalition for Cable TV in
the Dorms. He thought he gave the Elections Committee
sufficient notice of his intentions, and he expected the ballots
to be reprinted to include the coalition’s name.

Abrams’ definition of the word slate and the Elections
Committee’s definition, however, were in disagreement. A
slate is traditionally two or more candidates running on the
same ticket — not one candidate, as Abrams sees it. The
word “slate,” as used in the code is ambiguous, primarily
because they did not have the foresight to deﬁne it terms
independent of Webster’s. The Election Committee decided
on Monday’ not to change the ballots to include Abrams’
slate and not to postpone the election. Abrams, the Elections
Committee and the other candidates all offered a litany'of
stances, excuses, accusations and ultimata overthe incident.
' Rumors are now circulating that Abrams, if he loses the
election, will challenge the Elections Committee’s decision
and ask that the election be invalidated.

This is not the first time the Election Committee or, more
specifically, its code has been in the middle of a controversy.
Recently, a misinterpretation of the elections code resulted
in candidate Laura Eliason’s being disqualifed from the race.
The committee will have to evaluate the code and possibly
revise it — again.

Additonal controversy began two days ago in the pages of
this newspaper. Because of a printing error in Monday’s
edition, the names of the presidental candidates did not
coincide with their respective pictures. The candidates had
every right to be upset over the error, but the response of
candidate Greg Petro has exceeded reasonable limits.

Our endorsement of Petro was based on qualities very *
different from those ‘he has exhibited since the error
occurred. An election as important as SGB can make anyone
nervous, but so will an office as important as SGB president.
Both require a mature and rational outlook. ,

The repeated visits to The Pitt News offices by Petro and

his “campaign manager" went beyond assuring that a correc- .

tion would be printed. The Pitt News is intended as a forum
for opinion and information, not as a complaint box for the
SGB elections.

The manner in which the candidates handled themselves
prior to the elections raises the question of how they will act
if elected to SGB. The problem of “communication" has
been made all too clear by this week’s events.

These incidents can only further the bad image of student
government possessed by the student body. Politics may
have invented petty squabbling, but these squabblings
should play no role in student government, which, like stu-
dent media, is intended as a learning experience.

The Pitt News Editorial Board endorsed its candidates

‘ this week, and it stands by those endorsements. However, it

also endorsed an efficient student goverment, free of the type
of behavior some have displayed/this week.

Invasion Set A Dangerous Precedent .

By MARTY WILLIS

The Cuban Revolution of I959
marked a permanent change in
international relations‘ within the
Western Hemisphere. American
policymakers have devoted more
energy to preventing the appearance
of “another Cuba" in Latin America
than they have to any other political
obiective of the last 24 years. .-

This effort has taken a variety of
forms — diplomatic pressure within
international organizations, mil-
itary aid and training for anti-
communist (also known as
“friendly”) governments, and eco-
nomic boycotting of Cuba and, since
I979, Nicaragua —- most of them
legal and legitimate. Other, more
questionable tactics have been used
as well, such as the supposedly
“covert” CIA plan to oust the Sandi-'
nista regme in Nicaragua by fund-
ing and training an army of
expatriate Nicaraguans.

The rationale for all this includes
the North American perception,

never stated publicly, that Latin’

America and the Caribbean are,
after all, still “our backyard.” Unfor-
tunately, this kind of ethnocentric
chauvinism is a fundamental com-
ponent of Washlngton’s mentality,
especially since the arrival of the for-
eign policy disaster that is the Rea-
gan Administration.‘ - ‘ '
But the battle for Grenada, still
being fought a week after the U.S.
invasion, has set a new and danger-

ous precedent. For the first time
ever, American soldiers are in direct
combat with Cuban troops. Think
about this for a minute: Reagan’s
Yankee imperialist intruders and
Fidel Castro’s revolutionary com-
munist intruders are running around
the island of Grenada trying to shoot
and kill each other. But these guys
are only I8, 20 or possibly 25 years
old. One. of them could be the skinny
kid from your high school gym class.
Now they’re killing and dying in a"
faraway tropical paradise. For
what? _ » -

What is the issue? What's behind
all the strategies, maneuvers and kil-
lings? Ideology.’ The events of the

past week should show us something

very frightening, if we can still see
with any perspective after all the
years of absorbing dispassionate
news reports and nationalistic
speeches from various government
officials. _

Political ideology is runping out
of control. Not content simply to.
dominate the way we all view the
world, the monster now threatens to
explode, embroiling us in a new se-
ries of wars. Perhaps humanity is
finally readying, after all the false
alarms, to have “the war to end all
wars."

Maybe these words are unduly
alarmist. Maybe no such series of
wars is in the cards. But if not, it
could be because the American pub-

_ Iic knows how to draw the line. as in

the Vietnam experience. Presuma-
bly, there is only so much we will
take in the way of wars _ and
invasions.

The militarism of the Reagan
Administration is suddenly becom-
ing overt, not covert.-Our political
and military leaders have always
been prepared to send thousands of
young men around the globe to die
for “democracy,” but they count on
the American people’s consent to a

. considerable extent. If not for public

opinion, U.S. troops would have

~moved. into El Salvador two years
_ ago.

The Pentagon may have contin-
gency plans to invade almost every
country in the world, but how can
anyone expect to impose democracy
at gunpoint? Now that the invasion
of Grenada has forfeited whatever
moral superiority the U.S. had
enioyed since the Soviet take-over of
Afghanistan, what intervention will
come next? -

Many Americans are wondering it

- the administration would dare to

invade Nicaragua next. I know at
least two’ Pittsburghers who
seriously expect such an invasion
within weeks. If this prediction
comes true, how preposterous will
the idea of a war against Cuba be?
Or against the Soviet Union? A great
deal depends on how much the
American people are willing to
accept.

Elections Chair Defines ‘Slate’

Dear Editor:

Once again, problems have arisen
for the Student Government Elec-
tions Committee (SGEC). The first
situation to arise was that of Laura
Eliason, who had broken SGEC
compaigning rules and was thus
expelled ‘from the elections. The
SGEC did what it had to do to insure
a fair and equal election for all
involved. The Avery Abrams con-
troversy is the second situation.

Avery Abrams has petitioned the

Elections Committee to run as a
slate on the ballots. This produced
two problems. First, Mr. Abrams
somehow obtained an outdated
copy of the elections code which did
not specify that he had to turn his
petition in one week before elec-
tions.~ This mistake was recognized
by the Elections Committee, and the
time period of last‘year’s code (48
hours) was upheld for Mr. Abrams
to achieve his desired slate.

That brings us to problem number
two. Does Avery Abrams and the
Coalition for Cable TV constitute a
slate? Mr. Abrams argues that the
coalition he represents places him in
a situation of heading a political

party thus giving him the right to run
as a slate. He cited that “the Repub-
lican party is a slate." ' ,

According to the SGEC elections
code- Article V, sec. 2, (a,b,c),-the
American Heritage Dictionary and
Webster’s Dictionary, Mr. Abrams’
definition is incorrect. The diction-
ary deﬁnition of a slate is “a list of
the candidates of a particular party
running for various offices." Web-
ster’s goes on to define a slate as “a
list of candidates proposed for nom-
ination or election."

In both definitions, the word “list”
is stressed, proposing the number of
candidates to be plural. Also, 'under
the appropriate section of the elec-
tions code, it states “candidates may
campaign together.” Emphasizing
once again the plural form. Combin-
ing these definitions and rules, the

logical conclusion is that a slate.

must consist of two or
candidates.

In fact, the SGEC has a limit of
four that are allowed to run as a
slate. In accordance with the proper
definition ofa slate and Mr. Abrams
position, the SGEC, ruled not to
postpone the elections because Mr.
Abrams did not constitute a slate.

ITIOTC

Furthermore, we gave Mr. Abrams
an additional 24 hours to produce a

second candidate to fulfill his slate. L

business cannot be assessed until the
strike is over.

“We don't know if we'll be able to
keep them [new customers] or not,"
Sperry said. _

He added that the co-op has

— placed two ads in the Pit: News and

plans to place ads, in other local
newspapers to make people in the
area more aware of the co-op.
Members of the co-op receive a 20
percent discount on items over non-

members. To be a member, aiperson ‘

either must buy a share in the co-op,

‘ and volunteer to work at the co-op a

few hours a month or pay a monthly
due. .
“We’ve found that our existing
members are also buying more at the
co-op than before the strike,” Sperry
said.

Information concerning the status
of negotiations has not been released
because the Federal Mediation Ser-

vice has asked both the union and .

the Giant Eagle not to give out any
information about the talks, accord-

Page 5

ing to Giant Eagle official Jonathan
Williams and Richard Flanagan, a
community organizer for Support

‘Our Neighborhoods Action Coali-

tion, (SNAC) a local group that is
working closely with the union.

“The federal mediator involved
did publicly state that progress has
been made,” said Flanagan.

City Council has granted the
request made by SNAC members
and Giant Eagleemployees to look
into the matter because Giant Eagle
used money from an Urban Devel-
opment Action Grant (UDAG) to
build a warehouse and large freez-
ers, Flanagan said.

He added that the warehouse and
freezer project was supposed to
create jobs in the area. Council is
questioning the “good faith" of
Giant Eagle, according to Flanagan,
because the freezer stage of the pro-
ject has not been completed. SNAC
claims that the jobs created were
merely transfers from out-of-state
operations that were shut down.

continued from page one
dent Activities was notified of the
event through Greek adviser Bridget
Guernsey, it was vetoed. ,

Both‘ Wilson and Solomon said
theythought they went through all
the proper channels of .the univer-
sity, from the Office of Risk Man-
agement to the campus police, to
secure clearance for the event and
were not aware that Student Acti-
vites had to be notiﬁed.

“I really didn’t think we needed
their approval,” Wilson said.

Solomon contends that there were
political reasons for the competi-
tion’s cancellation ' and that they
originated in the Office of Student
Activities.

“It’s a harmless event perceived as
dangerous for somebody’s political
future,” he said.

When contacted about the-reason
for cancelling theevent and Solom-
on’s assertion, student activities
director Andy Smith said there were
no political implications whatsoever
and the issue was the sequestering of
Bigelow'Boulevard and the incon-
venience that would cause to Pitt’s
87-percent-commuter population.

“Nobody here is running for

office,” Smith said. “It’s a baseless

charge by somebody who doesn't
have the facts.” .

Smith said Bigelow Boulevard is a
“main thoroughfare” and that,
although the university does occas-
sionally close it down, most recently
for the Homecoming parade, it is
never closed all day.

“We don’t do things to put our
students at a disadvantage,” he said.

Smith said he was not aware that
the winner would" be ﬂown to Day-

tona Beach or that Pitt was the only
college to decline participation,
questioning the accuracy of Solom-
on’s facts. He also said the car com-
petition had no history at the
university, unlike the Homecoming
parade, to justify closing Bigelow
Boulevard and that, although the
project was planned for a month, “it
was not well organized in advance.”

“We’re not here to send students
to Daytona Beach,” Smith said.
“We’re here for education.”

Solomon, reached later, said that
he does not think Chrysler and the
National Safety Council, an organi-
zation he referred to as being “one
step” from Santa Claus, would allow
their names to be placed in an ad
that was false.

He also said he had received 30 to
40 phone calls yesterday from Pitt
students inquiring about how they
could participate in ’ the event.
Solomon said the competition could
not have any “history” because this
is the first year it is being held, but it
has a “track record” at Stanford, the
University of Pennsylvania and
othercolleges around the country.

A question as to who was respon-
sible for cancelling the permit arose
because Wilson said he was told by
the Greek adviser that the city had
cancelled it, but Smith said he had
initiated the action. Wilson called
the situation “strange.”

“The city approved it, the Risk
Management Office approved it,
news and publications approved it,”
he said. “Why would the city
approve it?”

Because Pitt refused participa-
-tion, Solomon was forced to go up
Forbes Avenue to Carnegie-Mellon

THE FIIEDHTING
IRISH

By CHARLIE O'HARA
And MARK A. SINDLER

It will be like walking through the
hallowed halls of a museum. The
more steps that are taken, the more

A there is to gape at as the eyes swivel

the neck in 360-degree revolutions.
To revere the occasion is to ﬁnd
the mind in total awe of what is
being perceived.
Come this Saturday, the Pitt foot-
ball team will ﬁnd itself amidst a
legendary institution when the

Panthers travel to South Bend, Ind., "

to face another legendaryartifact,
Notre Dame.

Indeed, this is what many college
football followers point to when
mentioning the authentic memora-
bilia of yesteryear. Notre Dame Sta-
dium is the place where dreams are
played out in reality, where young-
sters dream one day of walking over
the turf that made the Four Horse-
men famous, that supported the
likes of Ara Parseghian and Knute
Rockne, to reveal just an inkling of
Notre Dame’s past greats.

In three days, the Panthers, once
themselves youngsters and harbor-
ing fantasies of one day matching
their talents against this utopia of a
football team, will enter through the
gates of the Fighting Irishmen’s

‘home field to prove just what a real

football team is composed, of.
Simply stated, it will be ‘Pitt (6-2)
vs. Tradition (also 6-2).

Hoover  
Courts
Potential

By LAURIE KUBLI

There was a chill in the air this
Halloween, a cold, pervasive draft
that pulled collars closer together
and plucked stubborn leaves from
brittle branches.

Autumn's frosty mornings make
starting the car and getting to classes
more difficult than ever, many stu-
dents optingto forgo the battle and
stay in bed. I

Now is not the time for idleness,
though, but for action —»— the type of

fiery intensity that quickly chills the»

opposition and leaves no doubt as to
which is the better team.

This is the goal of the Pitt
women’s volleyball team, whose

second-place ﬁnish in a ﬁeld of five.

teams in the weekend Tennessee
Classic enabled the spikers to regain

‘ some of the confidence momentarily

lost sight of recently.

One player warming to that task-

with an intensity, her quiet demean-
or belying it all, is freshman outside-
hitter Sue Hoover, a graduate of
Richland High School, the latest
state Class AA champion.

Hoover faced a former Richland
teammate this weekend, Jill Berke-
bile of North Carolina.

“We were definitely up for that
game,“ Hoover said. “It felt really
weird playing Jill because Ifelt likel
should‘ have been playing over there
beside her instead of against her.

_ ‘‘I just wanted to play really well,
to show that Pitt has the better
program.” V I -

A Chance Meeting With
Fate, Tradition Beckons

Many of these are the same-

Panthers that witnessed, perhaps
helplessly, a 31-16 mugging last year
on their own turf. Included in the
report of stolen items were national
title hopes.

A similar concept does not hinge
on this years edition‘s outcome.

though, are the Panthers’ present
chances of snagging near-major
bowl bids. . '

It is a near-awesome task for a
team of players none of whomshave
ever seen the inside of— Notre Dame
Stadium. The excitement as well as
some nervousness flows through._the
veins of many of them as the day
quickly draws near.

Pitt has not won at Notre Dame
since 1976, when Tony Dorsett was a
senior, Gerald Ford was president
and the Panthers were the national
champions. Pitt won impressively,
31-10, as Dorsett ran for 163 yards.

Since then, there have been two
new presidents elected, and there
have been three Notre Dame victo-
ries ('l9-9 in 1977, 26-17 in 1978).

Neither Pitt nor Notre Dame can
afford another loss if they intend on
finishing the ’83 ‘campaign in the
Top 10. .

Though none of the Panthers will
admit that the game resembles an
infant taking his first steps, the
incentive of all the post season
makes for a heightened intensity and
a drop of the unknown, each player’s
insight into and anticipation of the
weekend contest makes for what
could be potentially the most
inﬂuential game of the season.

Senior All-America candidate
free safety Tommy Flynn: “The,
Notre Dame tradition goes back as
far as college football does. The Pitt-
Notre Dame rivalry is one of the
premier games in college football. I
remember watching the games in the
’70s when Dorsett was at Pitt.

“The game on Saturday is the
turning point of our season. It will
determine what we do for the rest of
the season.”

The Lady Panthers hand deli-
vered that message in no uncertain
terms by defeating the Lady Tar
Heels in three games by an average

' of eight points.

Coach Shelton Collier believes

Boaters’ Record   
Slips Below .500   

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt soccer team saw its
record drop below .500 when Gen-
eva defeated the'Panthers 2-! Mon-
day evening on the road.

The match, originally scheduled
for last Tuesday, was postponed
because of poor ﬁeld conditions, but
according to Pitt head coach Leo
Bemis, the field was not any better
two nights ago, contributing to Gen-
eva’s first goal.

“A soft shot from the corner hit a
piece of sod and the ball took an
unusual bounce," Bemis said. “Our
goalie, Dave Torrence, stopped the
ball, but couldn’t hold on, and the
rebound was knocked in,”

Halfway through the second half,
Pitt evened the score at 1-1 when
Bob Howard scored on an assist
from senior Nick Wilson. Three
minutes later, though, Geneva went
ahead for good and, in the process,
Pitt's season record fell to 8-9-1.

“We knew it was going to be a
close game when we went in there,"

_Bemis remarked. “Both teams had

some gooi opportunities to score
goals but didn’t."

One reason the Panthers may not
have taken advantage of scoring
opportunities is because they were
missing the services of their leading
scorer, freshman Rich Godfrey, who

‘ was "spending the weekend at his

home in Fallston, Md. '

When, on Sunday, the Geneva
coach exercised his option to have
the game moved back to Geneva

_(after originally being scheduled for, _ —

Pitt Stadium), that did not give
Godfrey enough time to return to
Pitt.

1 Final Kick‘

Tonight an era comes to a
close, one that has been in exist-
ence for the past 32'years.

Leo Bemis, Pitt head soccer
coach, will lead his squad onto
the carpet of Pitt Stadium for the
ﬁnal _time when the Panthers
square off aganist Akron.
Though the match, scheduled to
begin at 7:15 p.m-., is not Bemis’
ﬁnal one this season‘, it is Pitt’s
last home encounter. , ,

Bemis will retire once Pitt’s
season ends with the Big East;
Championships in Connecticut
next weekend. He first h_eralded
soccer onto the Pitt campus in
1951, when the sports had its
start as a club.

Since 1953, soccer has been a.
varsity sport. Only one other Pitt
coach, basketball’s Doc Carlson

(1923-53), has served as long as
Bemis in Pitt's coaching ranks.

intensity,” he said. “Sue used her
topspin serve to ace Jill, and blocked
Jill's spikes several times. Sue was a
major reason for our win, and Jill
was somewhat neutralized.”

- Collier observed that Hoover’s‘,

numbing serve more closely resem-
bles a spike than a serve.

His acquaintanceship with

-Hoover began three years ago when

the fourth-year coach saw the young
spiker playing in the Pennsylvania
state volleyball championships. Col-
lier was then organizing this area’s
Junior Olympic squad, and said that
Hoover and current teammate Kris

’Wexell were the nucleus of his young

team that finished fifth at the Ama-
teur Athletic Union’s national

championships that year.

Hoover was a starting middle
blocker on the Junior Olympic cir-
cuit that first year, as well as the
following two years when the team
placed third in I98] and fourth in
1982. Richland’s captain during her
senior year, Hoover led her high

school to the top podium in Class
AA.

The outside hitter, who earned l0
varsity letters in high school (volley-
ball, basketball, track) and was
actively sought by the other’ state
school, Penn State, credits her
coaches with developing her volley-
ball skills.

“Shelton has made so much
improvement with me — advanced
my skills in specific areas,” she said.

“Linda Renzi, my high school
coach, is fabulous. My sister, Paula,
was our assistant coach and my jun-
ior high coach, and she really pushed
me to do better.”

The experience with the Junior-

Olympics not only sharpened Hoo-
ver’s skills but greatly inﬂuenced the
mental aspect of her game.

“I used to get down on myself,"
the business major continued, “but
then I saw the other players weren't
doing that — I had to change my
attitude toward the game and
toward myself.

“I've matured as a result.”

Collier is impressed by the changt
in Hoover since leaving the small,

rural high school of Richland, which
graduated only 187 students this
spring. ”

“Sue came here shy and modest,’
Collier said, “but she is becoming
more and more self-confident. Sue is
a more aggressive player, but she
still maintains a good-natured atti-
tude along with her emotional devel-
opment in playing college
volleyball.”

On a team with highly-specialized
positions, Hoover is diverse enough
to be the only player to consume all
three spots up front. At season’s
start, the freshman started at middle
blocker alongside veteran hitter
Ulana Kohutiak.

Now Hoover starts right side (ai
grueling blocking spot) and left side
front, a demanding area she was not
accustomed to.

Collier said that it was Hoover’s
left-side hitting that proved to be a
deciding factor in the team’s early-
season victory over nationally
ranked Florida State.

“I loved every minute of it,”
Hoover recalled of the FSU match.

Hoover’s Potential Vacuums lnexperience

“I guess you could say I felt pretty
good about that."

This weekend, Pitt hosts the Con-
verse Classic, featuring a Friday
night matchup at 7 p.m. with Big
East rival Georgetown, once
defeated by Pitt this season.

Saturday the Lady Panthers host
Cincinnati at l0 a.m. and later face
Eastern Kentucky at 8 p.m. in the
gym of perennial state Class AAA
champions, Norwin High School.

Hoover sees these matches as
crucial. V

“There will be a big crowd at Nor--
win,” she remarked. “It’ll be very
exciting because we play better for a
crowd. The Georgetown game will
also be important, to determine the
best team in the East,”

Already Hoover has opposed
such collegiate forces as'Purdue,
Penn State, Mississippi and Ken-
tucky, amongst ‘others. Hence, she is
no stranger to success on the volley-
ball court — whether victory for the
team wasattained or not. .

“It would be nice to win the
NCAAS,” she said, anticipating

Baseball Potpouri. . ..

Even though the baseball season
ended over two weeks ago, news
from the hot-stove league keeps

ﬂowing around.

The Pirates have asked waivers on
pitcher Bob Owchinko for the pur-
pose of giving him his unconditional
release. Owchinko appeared in one
game for Pittsburgh, giving up one
run and two hits without retiring a
batter. '

Also granted outright releases
were Philadelphia second baseman
Joe Morgan and Texas pitcher Jon
Matlack and infielder Larry Bittner.

Morgan may return to San Fran-
cisco, which is closer to his home in
Oakland. The 19-year veteran has
not determined if he will return in
1984.

Texas vice president and general
manager Joe Klein said both were
released to give a look at young
prospects in the organization andto
give the two a chance to catch on
with another team.

Legendary Remembrance.

National Football League com-
missioner Pete Rozelle said,
“George Halas leaves modern pro-
fessional football as his memorial.”

Halas, the founder, owner and
longtime’ coach of the Chicago
Bears, died two nights ago in his
Chicago home at the age of 88. He
was the last surviving founder of the
NFL.

Rozelle called Halas “the
National Football League — its.
founder, the driving force that sus-
tained it during struggling pioneer
years.”

He said Halas was the “owner-
coach innovator whose dynamic
Bear teams triggered public accep-.
tance of the NFL, and the revered
elder statesman whose vision and
vitality were pivotal in the league

growth.”

Hall-of-Fame _quarterback Sid
Luckman, a mainstay of the “Mon-
sters of the Midway,” who domi-
nated pro football in the 1940s,
recalled the “dedication of his play-
ers, the people he cared for, his com-

‘ passion for human beings.”

Bear coach Mike Ditka, a star of
the last championship team in 1963,
called Halas a difficult man, who

I ~ was always deserving of respect.

«Said Ditka, “I had my differences
but I never lost my respect for him.
There’s a big difference there. You
don’t have to agree withasomebody
so long as you respect them."

A i A If you're a commuter, you will want a commuter

 “ on the board to represent your needs to the
.'  administration. '

  “ If you're involved in any student organization,

the elected members of the board have a final say in
the allocations of funds for your group.

If you live off campus, you will want to elect a
student who realizes your needs such as a campus
van that operates late at night.

All students sho/111d realize that the SGB exists to
represent student needs and concerns.

During his term, the president of SGB meets with
A  many university faculty members in an effort to
' ' assess student needs. He is given the authority to
appoint SGB members to a variety of committees so
as to provide student input. This studentinput pro-
vided via committees can be seen as SGB’s ”power
of suggestion.” A

By giving the opportunity to speak, to meet and
discuss issues with the administration directly, the
board's ”power of suggestion" can lead’-to a ”power
of influence.” " r

Aside from these powers, the board holds a defi-
nite financial power. Every winter term-, student
organizations submit a detailed budget tofthe Allo-
cations committee requesting funds for activities
and general expenses. These funds come from your
student activities fee. The board has the final say
over the budget recommendations.

As you can see, your vote can put the person in
office who will do the best for you.
