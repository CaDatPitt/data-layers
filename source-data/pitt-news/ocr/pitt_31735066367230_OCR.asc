Nixon Edges Senator Kennedy
In Weekly Student Voting Poll

Vice President Richard M. Nixon edged ahead of Sen-
ator John F._ Kennedy by three per cent in the second of a
series of weekly polls of voting opinions of thePitt student

body.

Forty-six per cent of the students cast their vote for
Nixon, 43 per cent for Kennedy, nine per cent were unde-
cided and two per cent gave n09

opinion.

Last week students interviewed
cast 55 per cent for Kennedy and
43 per cent for Nixon. A small
sample of the Sept. 26 inter-
viewees, on being re—interviewed,
showed an even distribution be-
tween the two presidential candi-
dates. K

Debate Influenced Vote

Almost two—thirds of the stu-
dents interviewed said that they
had watched the first Kennedy-
Nixon debate. Seventy-four per
cent of this group indicated that
the debate had some or consider-
able influence on their choice for
president.

Parents voting preferences
also showed a swing. toward

week’s poll. Forty-ﬁve per cent
supported Nixon, 34 per cent
Kennedy, four percent indicat-
ed split votes between parents.

Five per cent were still unde-

-dents interviewed did not know

how their parents would vote;

SG Committee
Reveals Health
Service Probe

Phil Levin, chairman of Student
Government Health and Welfare
Committee, reported that among
the ﬁfty resident students inter-
viewed, information regarding the
inﬁrmary and other health services
was scant.

Levin stressed that the commit-
tee's ﬁndings are not an inference
that any of the doctors on the
health service staff are incompe-
tent.

Health Service Unknown

The investigation showed three
areas .in which organization is
lacking, the committee reported.
Freshmen were not informed dur-
ing orientation week about the
functions of the health service or
the location of the inﬁrmary, as
shown by their lack of knowledge
in this respect, Levin stated.

“If they had attended resi-
dence hall meetings, to which
they were invited, they would
have been informed,” said Dr.
Swartzbaugh, dean of students.
According to Dr; Swartzbaugh
such information was given at
ﬂoor meetings and ball meet-
ings.

In addition, it was found that
physical exams were not given to
men students of the Freshman
class. “This matter was handled
in a very slip-shod way," said
Levin.

Campus Unprotected

Finally, it was reported that the
doctor’s oiﬁce hours last until 4:30
and then leave the campus without
the protection of a physician.

What more could a budding research engineer want? Steve
Polaski, B.S. in electrical engineering, January, 1959, starts

out for his day’s work enthusiastically, with a cheerful send-
'oﬁ' from his charming young wife. The car and infant son are
both 1960 models, the pleasant new home is in the heart of the
Allegheny Mountains . . . and the job is supervisor of the ﬁeld
portion of an extensive research and development program for the
first 460,000-volt electric trainsmvission line in the United States.

Steve ﬁnds living in this mountainous area ideal for the pursuit
of his main hobby, hunting. His equipment includes two riﬂes
and two shotguns in prime condition and he enjoys exciting
off-hours sport bagging wild turkeys, pheasants and rabbits

in the forests near his home.

Another hobby, photography, ﬁts right into his work schedule.

Flashback: Eleven months after starting with his

in a_ research project at General Electric ompany’s

he is seen -at the G.E. lab where he helped develop
instruments to measure lightning current.

 

At one of the two 460,000-volt line structures near

Reveals Health

Service Probe

(Continued from Page I)

Dr. Swartzbaugh explained
that a plan is being proposed for
"(January which would require
men to have physical examina-
tions by their own physicians.
Unless such a plan is executed
one entire class of men will have
had no examinations.

Levin proposed a three point
program to ﬁll the needs of the
present health service system: All
students should be required to
have a complete physical examina-
tion prior to -entering the Univer-
sity: the orientation system should
be revamoed on the matter of in-
forming freshmen as to health
services and facilities.

Resident Needed

“I propose that a resident doctor
be brought on this campus before
January," he said in his third
point.

In addition to Chairman Levin,
the following three members of
the Health and Welfare Com-
mittee participated in the in-
vestigation: John H i b s h a m,
Steve Lipton and Richard Rosen.

The committee posed these ques-
tions to students they interviewed:
During orientation week were you
informed about the University
health services‘? What would you
do if you became seriously ill‘?
Did you ever experience an illness
at the University which required
medical aid?”

"HOME SWEET HOMECOMIING”

A great number of people lmve been asking me lately, “What

why my new sports car looks that I h:i\'en't had time to answer.
I am now pleased to report that I finally di.<.<:o\'oro(l why my
sportscar leaks-—I have been driving it upside down—aud so
I am ready today to turn my attention to Homecoming.

Even the football gutne does not improve their tempers.
_“Hmmph I" tlwy snort as the home team completes a 101-yard
march to a touchdown. “Do you call that football’? Why, back
in my day, they'd have been over on the first down! By
George, football was football in those days—not this namby-
pamby girls’ game that passes for football today! Take a look
at that bench—50 substitutes sitting there. Why, in my day,
there were 11 men on a team and that was it. When you broke
a leg. they slapped a piece of tape on it and you went right back
in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Sign.-
foos, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I
mean, he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry?
Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning
drop kick in the last four seconds of play, dead as he was. Back
in my day,’ they played foollmll, by George!" .

lIver_vthing. say the old grads, was better back in their day-
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the
old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a
smoke like .\l::rlboro~never a cigarette with such a lot to like
-—never zl filter so eas_\' drawing, a flavor so mild yet hearty, so
abundant, so bountiful-—never a choice of ﬂip—top box or soft
pack.

So o_ld grads. young gratis, and undergrads, why don't you
settle back and have a full-ﬂavored smoke‘? Try Marlboro, the
ﬁltered cigarette with the unﬁltered taste, and Homecoming
will be a happy occasion and the sun will shine‘and the air will
be ﬁlled with the murmur of wings and no man's hand will be
raised against you. I

To many Pitt students the
most indelible memories of high
school are of participation in a
band or orchestra. The many
extra hours spent rehearsing was
fun more than it was work. And
the high school band always had
a certain spirit of its own, more
intense than that of the student
body.

Individual members, secretly aspiring to be con-
cert artists, practiced long hours after homework
was ﬁnished. They hoped to be chosen to partici-
pate in All-State Band or Orchestra, or Pittsburgh
Junior Symphony. Those who were especially de-
‘ termined as well as skilled could hope to be chosen
as a» state ﬁnalist in the Pennsylvania Music and
Forensic League contests, _where the competition
was state-wide and too keen for the squeamish and

a Letters to the Editor 

Crooks, and Cheats;
Must be Punished

Editor, The Pitt News: ’

In the “Letters to the Editor”
column of The Pitt News on
October 5th, there were two let-
ters (one coward would not even
sign his name) arguing that
honesty or dishonesty is the con-
cern of the individual.

More speciﬁcally, they said
that one should ﬁx his attention
on his own paper, and be obli-
vious to cheating that others may
employ. Dishonesty, they state,
has its own intrinsic ultimate
punishment.

Well, I don’t believe in heaven
or hell. That these people said
this, is, even to my condescend-
ing self, horrifying. We live in a
society -— all together. What one
person ’does has its effect on us
all. Cheating, just as robbing, is
felt by the object of the action.
The robber does not suffer unless
he is caught. The robbed always
suffers. 1

Crimes against society m u s t
not be ignored. Cheaters must
ﬁnd good reason here not to

cheat; what happens in hell is.

not important.

Student Finds Midday

fine. But the selection of speak-
ers from the political ﬁeld has
been narrow, inadequate, and
unfortunately biased. The num-
ber of speakers chosen from the

political field has been narrow,-

inadequate, and unfortunately
biased.’ The number of speakers
chosen from the political left-of-
center as compared to the num-
ber of conservative thinkers per-
mitted to appear has been aston-
ishingly lopsided. _
In the past year, the Midday

rect in saying that the last con-
servative to appear was Hugh
Scott ‘during his campaign for
United States Senate in 1958.
Without question ,all of these
liberal spokesmen were worth
listening to and it was our good

fortune to hear their views. It
seems only reasonable, however,
that a similar _number of con-

Quiet Place for Study

Being a first trimester fresh-
man,‘I’ve been here at Pitt for
only a short’ period of time; I’ve
come to like this school a great
deal. -3,

But I have one problem. I can- . A
not ﬁnd a quiet place to study.
My classes and campus activities
take up most of my daytime
hours, forcing me to receive eve-
ning hours forgstudy. In the eve-
ning the dormitories are not \
quiet enough because many stu-
dents have time to study during
the day and spend their evening
hours in leisure. I have tried al-
though to keep noises and inter- "
ruptions in my room and on my’
floor to a minimum. I do not ex-
pect others to make their study
time coincide with mine. '

In seeking a place to study, I
have tried the laundry and re-

, creation rooms. The light there is
good, but otherwise these rooms
are poorly equipped for this pur-
pose. The floor lounges are some-
times quiet, but they ‘are often
occupied with students taking a .
break from their studies. 

Thetlibraries have a quiet at- 
mosphere for—a few hours during 
the evening, but this is not
enough time to complete study’
requirements. Where else can I V 5
go to study where I can find they‘ 

/quietness necessary to think?

Last week an English lecturer ~
stopped short in his lecture on
organizing ideas, lowered his
head and very quietly comment-
ed, that it’s too bad that there is
nowhere on this‘ campus where
one can be alone and think.

What’s Behind the‘Blue Door

Tremblings

In Cathedral Basements

Recorded

Deep in the second basement of the‘ Cathedral behind
one of those blue metal doors is the seismograph station. This
little scientiﬁc unit consists of two_ instrument rooms and a

recording dark room.

Mounted on a ﬂoating platform based more than 60 feet
below the basement ﬂoor two seismographs record the trem-

blings of the earth from varying:

degrees in a northeast-southwest
line, while a third and newer in-
strument records vertical tremors.
Any disturbances are then record-
ed on light sensitive paper in the
dark room.

Once every twenty-four hours
University Seismologist. Eugene,
Sulkowski, or his assistant, Don-
ald Groff, enters the dark room
and removes the day’s record
from the revolving drum. The
record is then developed and
added to the month’s ﬁle.

Although designed for the use
of those who have an interest in
earthquakes, the seismographs
carry an interesting record of

“other things. Little waves on the

paper called microseises record
the amount of traffic passing by
and others show the expansion
and contraction of the Cathedral
as the temperature changes.

.__-.._..- . --..... .... . ,..g. . ..

Though few people at the Uni-
versity know of the station’s ex-
istence it receives mail from other
stations all over the world in re-
lation to seismic activity. The sta-
tion was established many years
ago and has been recording the
daily tremblings of the earth ever
since.

A step-child of the Geology de-
partment the seismograph station

Humorous Characters

Illustrate

‘Army’ Life

By ALVIN M. RESNICK
Soldier in the Rain by William Goldman (Atheneum,
$4), is a refreshing book prescribed for all those afflicted with
the it’s - the-fifth—week-of-school—and-I’m-four-weeks-behind-

in—my-work-already doldrums.

The secret of the book is the charming freshness and
innocence of its characters. The vulgarity usually associated

with army humor has been almost?

completely eliminated. and in its
place Goldman has successfully
substituted humorous character-
ization.
Duo Inseperable

Boyish Sergeant Eustis Clay of
the Camp Scott Transient Com-
pany is the “idea man” for the
team of Slaughter and Clay. Ro-
tund Master Sergeant Maxwell
Slaughter is the “barins" of the
inseperable duo. Together, these
two simple. but loveable G.I.'s
move from one amusing predica-
ment to another, making artiﬁcial

mountains out of Camp Scott
molehills.
Who in the world. for in-

stance, would risk court-martial
to obtain a second-hand electric
fan? VVell. Eustis Clay does.
In fact, Eustis bribes an offi-
cer, lies to his commander, and
even invents a new disease.
“sc"atbosis," in order to get the
Ian.

The explanation of “st-abosi.s.“
which Sergeant Slaughter, mas-
querading as Clay’s Doctor—Major.
relates to Clays commander over
the telephone forms one of the
comedy highspots oi‘ the book.

Disease Described

This is part of
Slaughter’s "scientiﬁc"
tion: “‘Now. in our constant
against disease. the central‘
dermal layer acts as what
might call a buffer. A shield. Bo-
tween the internal epidermal and
the external epidermal. Now the
internal epidermal gets along
pretty well by itself. He’s an in-

craftsmanship or hidden meaning.

Strong ChiefNeeded, Bowles Says

Urges Students
To Jump, Onto
Kennedy Wagon
In the next four years only
a “strong president,” and an
“informed public” with “new

ideas” can solve the many
problems facing the United

States, Chester Bowles told
his Midday Series audience Mon-
day.

With Kennedy as president,

Bowles declared, “we will have a
real sense of knowing where we
are going. a sense of purpose.”
Bowles believes that Kennedy’s
qualiﬁcations are more valid and

, more real than Nixon’s. Kennedy

has a “greater knowledge and un-
derstanding of where we are go-
ing." he said.

Foreign Question Emphasized

The next president will have to
face problems whose answers are
“obscure and unclear,” Bowles
stated. He emphasized the im-
portance of the foreign relations
question because “to all of us nu-
clear weapons are terrifying."

There are two possibilities
facing the American people:
“The Soviet, feeling an advan-
tage may try to blackmail us or
our allies thus setting off a nu-
clear war,” or it may be a case
of clear miscalculation. “We
can think that we will be at-
tacked and therefore must hit
first.” .

“It’s been 180 years since the
Declaration of Independence. Its
statements have not yet been deﬁ-
nitely put into aet.ion. We must
get on with these things that need
lone. Our new president must
use all of our nation’s resources?’

“The Democrats have faith,"
jlowles said. Inessence, the Dem-
.)cratic party will say “let’s do
more than we are doing, while the
Republicans are satisﬁed with
things as they are.”

For iWest Virginia Saturday  

Vignali, Martyrs, ’;

Guzik Ready to

See Action
BY JACK SMITH

At the Stadium this Satur-
day when the Panther clashes
with West Virginia the Cats
will have only one thought in
mind—Revenge.

The Blue and Gold remem-

members vividly the 23-15 lacing
the Mountaineers handed them
last year. The Favored Panthers
traveled to Morgantown; they left
more shocked than anything else,
for they were completely outclass-
ed.

This year the Golden Panthers
claim it will be a different story.
It’s Homecoming weekend; the
Panthers won their first game last
week and want more than any-
thing to pulverize the Mounties
who have a 0-3-1 record to date.

Record Not Spectacular

Actually the Panthers record,
1-2-1, is not more spectacular, but
the Cats have met more formid-
able opponents. However, grid-
iron experts say you can throw
away the record books when these
two teams meet, for anything can
happen.

The grudge series between
these two teams dates back to
1895 with the Panthers holding
a wide 38-13-1 margin. How-
ever, over the past four years
each team has taken a turn
winning. It’s the Panthers turn
to win this year.

“They ruined us last year,”
Fullback Jim Cunningham said.
“We might have gotten a bowl bid
if they hadn’t beaten us. We want
this one real bad."

Team Beginning to Roll

“The team is beginning to roll
now,” Halfback Bob Clemens said.
“I’d like to beat West Virginia

4:

Fierce Defensive‘ End

by five touchdowns.” The last time
the Panthers beat the Mounties
that bad was in 1904 when they
won 53-0. Since that time the
Mountaineers have taken great de-
light in containing “the boys from
the big city.”

After last week’s performance,
Quarterback Jim Traﬁcant is
again expected to guide the
Panthers attack. “I feel we can
win the rest of our games,”
Traﬁcant said. “We have some
of the best runners in the coun-
try and some of the finest re-
ceivers. It’s not hard to pass
when you have someone who
can catch.”

Halfback John Yaccino is start-
ing to approach the ratings the
coaches gave him earlier this year.
Last Saturday he ran harder and
faster than he has in previous out-
ings. Another surprise was Lou
Slaby. The young sophomore, who

has moved up to second string.

fullback, running behind Cunning-
ham, appears to have his eye on
the starting berth next year.

Injuries are healing according

to the trainers. Larry Vignali will A

strengthen the center of the line
now that he is ready to start again
at guard. Dick Matyus and Bob
Kuzik, both sidelined for the past
two weeks with minor injuries,
may see action. Big Dick Mills has
had several bad hemmorages in
his arms, but is able to play.

Fresh I Athletic
Teams Give Hint
Of Bright Future

Sports Editor

With the fgeshman football team posting, a 48-0 victory

_U"qver our southern cousins, West, Virginia, and the frosh
. cross-country squad beating the Penn State yearlings for
the first time in five years, it looks as though the future

years will bring some outstanding athletic teams to the Pitt

campus.

The fresh football win is significant in that the Panther
freshman teams always boast of having lots of good material

Four years ago the Cats w

ere supposed to havethe best
of the school. If my memory

is correct they received some pretty bad beatings that year
‘and played something near .500 ball.

Coach Bimbo Cecconi has ,a host of ﬁne backs this
year and has converted some of them to linemen. In the
two games that the Cubs have played thus far they have
yet to be scored upon and have displayed an awesome
oﬁensive attack. Cecconi has done a tremendous job of
converting those highly touted backs to hard nose line-

RICH.

As for the cross-country team, it is a rarity when the
Pitt frosh beat State. The Nittany Lions have the advantage
of giving more scholarships than the Panthers and receiving
»much more student support for their teams than do the Cats.

This year Coach Carl Rees has brought in distant run-

’ners instead of the usual 440-yard dash men. This will im-

prove Pitt’s track team in that it will give them crnore
strength in the one mile and two mile runs.

Another sport which looks like it will soon be ready

to produce consistently winn
squad. The Cats will have at
starting lineup this year and

ing teams, is the basketball
least one sophomore in the
they will have a couple of

freshmen on the fresh team who might be able to make

the varsity this year if they

were eligible.

So I guess- we can say that the sport picture around the
University should be improving in the near future, and who
can tell maybe someday the Panthers may be able to have
the people of Pittsburgh running around town yelling

“Pound ’em Panthers.”

Powerful Kick

“Frank Abel, the Akron center
forward, has one of the most pow-
erful kicks that I’ve ever seen,”
commented Coach Bemis.

But still the Panthers will
have to worry about their nu-
merous injuries. Pete Smith will
not practice all week in hope
that he may be ready for the
game Saturday. The pulled ten-
don in is heel has been giving
the “Little Leprechaun” a lot
of trouble.

If Corky Cuthbert runs and gets
his legs in good shape, he may be
able to play in top form against
Akron. Bob McNulty will be miss-

5ing’from —the Cats‘ lineup. Coach

Bemis said that he may move
Ron Prado up from the fullback
position and let Chuck Dunbar
ﬁll in for Prado.

It is very doubtful that George
Zanicopolous will play. “Zeke”
said, f‘I'll be out for one game at
the most.” _

Commenting on the Akron team,
Coach Bemis said, “They will

deﬁnitely be “up” for this game

With the excitement of the
World Series, the leading
(Scoop) Smith, feels
that he is not receiving due
credit. With a 12-3 record last

week and a 40-13' overall,

Scoop is far out in front of all
challengers. He said, “I concede
the championship to myself al-
though the season is half over.”

The woman on the scene, Jo-.

anne “Speedy” Dolinar, seems to;
be stealing some of the limelight:
away from the men. ‘Last week!

She passed the playergﬁand has her ‘ homa over Kansas and Purdue! ed,

sights set on the first spot. Speedy;
would appreciate the men losing.
all their games so she can move‘
into first place’ in the standings.
Fritz Walker, the player, prom-‘
ises better results this week, be-
cause he is studying the rating
sheets and "is certain that the
woman was lucky and will ﬂop.
Marshall “Whip ’em Yanks”
Romeo hopes he will do better
than the Yankees are doing.
Last week he picked the games
while watching the Yankees
win, but the hope for the Yanks
is not good this week. If he
wants to gain the first place

spot he will have to do better. 

The coaches, represented this
week by Coach Bimbo Steve Cec-
coni, are hoping for some of the
team’s winning luck to rub off on
them. They aren’tdoing their pro-
fession justice by not being able to
pick the rightlteams, but that is
why teams get upset every week.

Ted “Beat ’em Bucs” Colton is

living up to his boast of a few

weeks ago. Just like Henry Aaron
he says, “I will go back to drink-

' ing if I can’t move up in the stand-

ings.”
The upsets this week are Okla-

over Ohio State.

The independent section of the

Last year's champion, the Chi-

while the Iron Men are also :1
strong 3-0, and Psi Omega carries \
a 2-0 card. The three-way tie

Mountaineers Hope to Repeat Upset

By ART FLEISCHNER

Head Coach Gene Corum. will bring his winless West’

Virginia Mountaineers into the Stadium this Saturday.
Corum, who has just become head coach after ten years as
an assistant, is instituting a rebuilding process. West Vir-
ginia would like nothing better than a repeat performance of
last year’s 23-15 upset victory over the Cats.

The Mountaineers have been‘

Four Ex-servicemen

i

The Mountaineers have four ex- ‘

servicemtE*n on their squad. They
are Evans, Carman Pomponio and
Tom Huston, its two finest. de-
fensive backs, and sophomore
tackle Dick McGraw.

Pomponio substitutes for Ev-
ans on defense. He receives'lit-
tle credit from all but the most
astute observers of the defen-
sive game.

This year’s backﬁeld is bigger
and stronger. Although the block-
ing is adequate, the overall back-

Eli Kosanovich is the starting
left halfback. Don Myers leads
the Mountaineer rushing attack
with a 5.6 average per carry and
and 106 yards overall.

West Virginia is not a heavy
team. The average weight of the
line is 200 pounds: the backs av-
erage 186; an overall average of
195.

Three players are tied for the
t.cz—tm lead in pass receptions. They

Dave Santrock and Pete Trolley
are expected to start at the guard
positions with Keith Melenyzer
slated to see plenty of action.

Charles Lanasa is back to bulwark
the center of the line.

The sad part of the story is that
no single individual has stood out
-as the player or players Corum
lcould point to and say, "they will
lead us to new heights.” It appears
to be a group of good average
football players, with some very
promising sophomores.
