“The Human Adventure” To Be
Screened At Carnegie Hall

The most remarkable motion pic-
ture ever ﬁlmed, one in which the
earth cools from a volcanic, whirling
mass "into landand water, plains and
oceans; where prehistoric ‘beasts range
the new plains, glaciers creep over
them and back, man rises and gains
mastery over ﬁre, tools of ﬂint and
ﬁnally metal, tills the land, sails the
seas and ﬁnally the air, “The Human
Adventure,” will be shown for Univer-
sity students and faculty members
next Tuesday. -

All second hour classes will be
oniitte-:1 to provide time for the pic-
tures which will be shown at Car-
iiegie Music Hall at 9:30 o’clock. The
pictures have been rented by the
University in conjunction with Car-
negie Institute, Carnegie Institute of
Technology and the Pittsburgh Board
of Public Education. Each of these
organizations has booked a speciﬁc
hour for the showing of the ﬁlm.

“The Human Adventure” has been
classed as a 4,000 mile ﬂight across
the lands where mankind rose from
savagery to civilization. It was pro-
duced under the supervision of the
Oriental Institute of the University of
Chicago. The Institute is a scientiﬁc
organization for the study of past cul-
tures. The ﬁli1i,conip1etely in sound,
was produced under the scientific
supervision of Dr. James H. Breasted,
director of the Institute.

Repression Held ,
Valid At Forum

Dr. Shaffer Says, “We Recall
What We Want To”

“The concert of repression so
basic to psychoanalysis can be ﬁtted
into a m.ore objective theory of psy-
chology,” according to Dr. Laurance
F. Shaffer, assistant professor of psy-
chology at Carnegie Tech, who ad-
dressed the psychology forum Monday
afternoon.

“There is deﬁnite experimental evi-
dence," said Dr. Shaffer, “that we
tend to forget incidents associated
with emotions of fear, guilt, or shame
more rea.dily than incidents associated
with pleasant feelings. The tendency
of such ‘active forgetting’ to manifest
itself later in the form of phobias,
compulsions, and other behavior de-
fects can be explained by the theory
of conditioned response.”

‘Coed Captains Go Into Huddle,

Ball Gift Problem

 

It's an old truism that when you
want to get the girl friend the most
acceptable sort of remembrance for
the Yuletide season, you right aw_ay

page some ﬁrm old feminine friend
(the kind you can safely conﬁde in,
perlfalls) and plead with her to rustle
off and buy your honey something that
slie—the ﬁrm old feminine friend (the
kind you can safely conﬁde in, per-
haps)—-would herself like to be given.
And then you do an about-face and
figure that the girl friend would ﬁnd
that same gift very nice. ‘

The Military Ball committee is
working on the same tack,

The point is that the ten honorary
coed captains of the ROTC—the ten
seniors who, in the opinion of the
corps, are the most popular and most
everything in their class and set here-
abouts——hai_re -.been drafted by the
"committee t‘o‘fi'ust:le"'off"a"nd pick ‘out
the favors for the ‘big, four-band, four-

ballroom Ball next week.

The girls have been reliving those
days of December when the gift shops
and novelty stores and jewelry em-
poriuins were overrun with puzzled
shoppers. Their selections, when
ﬁnally made, promise to be “just what
the girls most like to receive as fav-
011$.”

The chairmen and sub-coininittee
chairmen of the affair have been
busy, themselves, selecting favors for
their fellow men. This will be the
first University affair to feature gifts
for the nien'as well as the women.

Barton Calls Personality, Poise,
Appearance Three Job Essentials

 

By James Donoghue

VVant a job?

Develop your personality, watch
your appearance and don’t be nervous.
These are the things that get_ men
jobs, according to J. Clyde Barton, di-
rector of the University Placement
bureau, who spoke before the YMCA
Monday freshman club at the Y hut.

“Personality will get you over,” he
said, “or it will keep you from getting
over. The majority of people whose
names are in our ﬁles and who don't
get jobs have no personality.”

“Don't ask me what I mean by per-
sonality,” he
can't give a deﬁnition. Even the pro-
fessors I have talked to don’t agree.
But you and I both know what I mean
when I say personality. My guess is
as good as anyone else’s.”

Said the director, “The University
P13081116‘-llt bureau has to be careful to
pick the right man. Its job is to build
up- a list of companies who will call
on the bureau when they happen to
need a new man - .
on the spot when someone we send
goes to the interview dressed careless-
ly. I won't be put on the spot if I
know beforehand that I can avoid it.”

According to Mr. Barton, the man
looking for work who “goes into an
ofﬁce and sits in a lump is rolled out
again without a, word.”

After personality, appearance was
called most inrportant. “You don’t
have to pay a lot of money for your
‘clothes to look well-dressed,” said the
speaker, “but the most important

continued, “because I.

. and it puts me,

thing is that your suit and overcoat,
hat and shoes harmonize.” Most peo-
ple, according to Mr. Barton, buy their
clothes with no thought of how they
will go with what they already have.
They wear grey hats with suits or
topcoats that demand brov.»-"n hats;
or they wear brown shoes with suits
that will only look well with black
shoes. "Mr. Barton did not discuss
neckties. , _

“Another fallacy is that many peo-
ple believe that you can't look well in
a $22.50 suit. The suit. isn’t what
counts; it’s what's in it."

“Don't be nervous,” was his third
recommend:-ition. Most people look-
ing for jobs have a slight tinge of in-
feriority coniplex. Mr. Barton be-
lieves that iiiaiiy students lose out be-
cause they can’t, or don‘t, ‘ippcar
natural and able to carry on a logical
conversation.

As more or less a side issue of his
general topic “The personality of the
job hunter,” Mr. Barton discussed
salesinen. He said that people never
try sales work until they can’t ﬁnd
anything else.
is that they're afraid of their own
ability,” he concluded.

In the early part of his address, Mr.
Barton gave some ‘brief statistics on
the number of men who have been
placed by his department. Last year
$20_.00-0 worth of work was handled
through the bureau. Indirectly, out
of the Placement bureau at the pres-
ent time, 431 FERA students are
working and 100 more are awaiting
further assignments.

Silverman invited

To Talk in South

To Lecture On Indispensability
Of Glass At ACS Meetings

 

   

Following the University debating
team by only a few days, Dr. Alexan-
der Silvernian, head of the department
of chemistry, goes south himself next
week. ,

The debating team, will make a tour
of six colleges and universities below
the Mason-Dixon line; Dr. Silverman
will speak, on invitation of the Amer-
ican Chemical society, before seven
southern branches. of that society on
“Glass: An indispensable factor in
modern civilization.”

-Recognized as one of the outstand-
ing authorities on glass in the United
States, Dr. Silverman has lectured on
the indispensability of that material
on countless occasions, and recently
over the air in conjunction with the
convention of the American Ceramic
society in Buffalo. His private col-
lection of rare specimens of glass is
among the most complete and valu-
able in existence. ,

The sections of the ACS which he
will address from March 19 to 30 in-
clude: Kentucky, at Lexington; East
Tennessee. at Knoxville; Georgia, at
Atlanta; Alabania, at Birmingham;
Louisiana, at New Orleans; Florida,
at De Land; and Virginia, at Williams-
burg.

At Atlanta, it will be a joint meet-
ing of ACS and Georgia Academy of
Science, and at Williainsburg, ACS
and Hampton Roads Chemists’ club.

Tomorrow evening, an annual con-
ference of paint, varnish, and lacquer
manufacturers and I technologists at
the‘ IJ'uquesne”'club,‘ will be addressed
by Dr. Silverman, on “Glass.”

Speaig/it Causes
Dickens Revival
By Performance

The revival of interest in Charles
Dickens, which has ﬂourished in the
past two years, was given additional
impetus Monday in Heinz House, when
Frank Speaight, famed British char-
acter actor, perform-.ed before a de-
lighted audience of about 250 stu-
dents.

Mr_ -Speaight began his performance‘

with two scenes from “Pickwick Pa-
pers,” which took place after the trial
of Bardwell versus Pickwick. These
were followed by an amazing sketch
of the domestic troubles between Da-
vid Copperﬁeld and his child wife,
Dora, in “David Copperﬁeld.”

After his main selections, Mr.
Speaight took the opportunity to
warn students against becoming elocu-
tionists. He demonstrated his argu-
ments with two satires on this art.
His keyword was “be natural,” and
his audience was ﬁnding it difﬁcult to
maintain composure between extreme-
1y humorous scenes.

Beginning In September, Degrees,

Five Divisions Listed

A course of training in govern-
mental service will be instituted
by the University in Scpteinbcr
uiidcr the supervision of Dr. El-
mer l)._ Graper, head of the polit-
icul science department, and Dr.
-.l‘a,n__lcs C. ‘C11-ai_'l_eswoi'th, assistant.
1310188301‘ or political science.

This course which will be known
its “"i:‘ne. Governmental service
Course will be open to both graduate
and undergraduate students. The un-
(lt}1‘g1‘adiia.te course leading to a degree
of Bachelor of Arts and a certiﬁcate
of attainment will consist of ﬁve di-
YISIOIISI f01j<-Eign service, international
trade, public administration, taxation
and ﬁnance. and labor relations. The
graduate course leading to a degree
of Master or of Doctor of Public Ad-
ministration will be more highly
specialized than that prescribed for
the undergraduate divisions.

111 1'eg‘<11‘d to the new course, Dr.
Charleswortli said:

.‘‘In my opinion the University of
Pittsburgh is_ pioneering in entering
this professional field, along with
other schools.”

Although the governments in the
leading European countries, })il1'tlCl'.--
larly France and England, have en-
couraged this type of education for
years, it IS a new development in the
United States. At the present time
in this country Princeton, l"-larvard,
George W’ a s h i n g t 0 ii, VVisconsin,
Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Uni-
versities include a course of this kind
in their curriculuni.

Commenting further on the course
Dr. C-harlesworth added:

“This course has been gone over
very carefully by the faculty. I con-
sider it the most complete of its
kind in the country.

“In a few years the government
service will constitute one of the
most flourishing careers of the col.
lege graduate.”

The. principal differences between the
Governmental Service Course for un-
dergraduates and any ‘major course in
political science or economies are the
following:

(1) Progress in the course will be
constantly supervised by a faculty
member designated as Coordinator of
the Governmental Service course who
will have authority to remove a stu-
dent from it, if his work is not indi-
cative, of future advancement in the
public service_

(2) [Division seminars will be con-
ducted in the senior year in which
each student will write a thesis and
do some ﬁeld work.

(3) "The total number of credits
required for graduation and certiﬁca-
tion is approximately 13 more than for
the usual bachelor’s course of" study.

(4) A higher than usual standard

. of accomplishment ..will.be demanded

of the student.

(5) Upon the completion of his
four year’s work the student will re-
ceive a certiﬁcate in addition to his
diploma.

The records of applicants for the
graduate course must be acceptable
to both the political science and eco-
nomics or sociology department. The
graduate ‘course differs from any pro-
granrof graduate study in the political
science. sociology 01' economics de-
partment in the following particulars:

(1) The students may not. take
more than three—quarters of their work
in any one department.

(2) ‘The student's thesis and his
oral and written examinations are un-
der the joint jurisdiction of the po-
litical science and economics depart.-
ment.

-(3) Part of the program of study
may consist of ﬁeld work at some dis-
tant point or of other extra-mural
investigation, at the discretion of the
student and his major professor and
the coordinators.

(4) Candidates for the degree 03
Doctor of Public Administration may,
with the consent of the coordinator.
submit evidence of proﬁciency in one
instead of two or more foreign 1311‘
guages. _

Freshmen entering the University
in 1935 who wish to take this course
will confer and register with 
James C. Charlesworth at registration
headquarters. He will also enroll
sophomores and juniors who expect to
enter it. Adjustments will be_ made
in their plan of study if possible to
permit them to complete the Govern-
mental Service course in the usual
four years. If a student's preparatory
school record is not commendable, he
-may be admitted to the course of pro-
bation for one semester.

Don’t Be In A Hurry,
Gloveriior

OV. GEORGE H. EARLE,
who comes to Pittsburgh to-
morrow night to attend the
Spring meeting of the University
Board of Trustees, should ar-
raiigc to attend some Spring
meetings of University classes
and activities, too, the day after
tomorrow and the day after that.
His visit can be as long, and as
informal, as he wants to make it.
He has our invitation to come to
class and answer Dr. VVilliams’
questions on international law, or
to insert a few suggestions of his
own on American foreign policy
into a lecture by Dr. James. If
the Governor is interested in state
politics, there are other students

reach conclusions.

He might well go to lunch with
a few seniors who would like to
be graduate -‘students,’ but ‘who
cannot be graduate students be-
cause of University budget econ-
omies that have wiped out fellow-
ships in order to save experienced
teachers. The Governor and the
seniors might ﬁnd the Univer-
sity’s state appropriation a theme
in common. _

Freshman, sophomore and ju-
nior students might find it a little
hard to lunch with the Governor,
but their interests in his budget
recoinmendations are no less di-
rect. They would want him to
visit the tall building and to be
shown the plans of the national-
ity rooms, the Foster llicinorial
and the Heinz Chapel.

As well as members of the
faculty, students will want Gov-
ernor Earle to reach a conclusion
on whether academic freedom is
abridged at this University.

Yes, indeed, Governor, you’ve
no idea how welcome you are at
Pitt. Stay out "West here awhile,
and when you return to Harris-
be surprised how
many of those letters from Mayor
.McNair and Harry Hopkins
won ’t need answering. Come up
to The Pitt News office and let ’s

Student Strike Breakers

“ HE DEMONSTRATION will
not be held——even if we have
to use force.”

Vlfhat powers of evil in a coun-
try of free traditions called forth
that statement? ‘Nliat citizens
will prevent what other citizens
from doing what?

According to the Los Angel-cs
correspondent of the Universal
Service, “patriotic” groups of
students at the University of-Cal-
ifornia at Los Angeles will pre-

vent ‘ ‘ radical ’ ’ students from
demonstrating in a one - hour
strike, April 12, against war.

The “patriotic” groups will use

$4,000,000 Medical Center

An Accusation
Three Little Words
By ROMAN LAPICA

$4,000,000 Medical Center

Just 27 Years ago, the Western
Pennsylvania Medical College was de-
scribed as “dirty, and disorderly be-
yond description.”

The next Year, 1908, it was consol-
idated with the University and the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching repo1'ted:

“A more thorough piece of house-
cleaning within so short a period
is hardly credible.”

‘Today the Medical School bides its
time as plans develop for the comple-
tion of Pitt’s three to four-million-
dollar medical center, which will
place it among the leading schools of
the country.

For 26 years the med school has
ranked A in Foundation ratings.
Today it is one out of 87 Canadian
and American schools so recognized.

I-3815 Year 371 Were refused recog-
nition.

According to plans, ﬁve buildings
will comprise the medical center.
The University hospital will have
eight parts, including the new ined-
ical school itself, of which the Eye
and Ear and a center section alone
are completed.

 

Economist Speaks

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, economist,
yesterday told the Occupational
Readjustment conference he hoped

Pittsburgh would be one of the six or
eight cities to be selected by the U.
S. Employment Service as research
centers for the study of unemploy-
ment.

He also threw out a warning that
no one can tell how many of the
10,500,000 unemployed in the coun-
try are employable.

Later he said about Huey Long:

“He will never be president.
The American people have too
much of a sense of humor.”

An Accusation

The war drags on. The League
brands Paraguay the aggressor. Eu-
rope declares an arms embargo
against the South American ‘republic.

And still Uncle Sam fails to act.
Dr. N. A. N_ Cleven, history, he-
lieves U. S. munition makers have

much to do with preventing the gov-
ernment from taking decisive action
in the war.

He told The Pitt News evidence
points to some connection between
munitions makers here and both
warring countries. Possibly contracts
made before and during the war have
forced companies to declare against
intervention in the squabble.

He added:

“There will be no move against
Paraguay, the aggressor, by the
United States until these contracts
run out."

On alignment of neighboring coun-

tries, Dr. Cleven said:

“Brazil and Peru are behind
Bolivia. Chile and Argentine fa-
vor Paraguay. The war, however,
is turning against Paraguay."

About the League, the professor

declared:

“it has one law for weak nations
and another for the strong. Of
course it will do nothing against
Italy in the Abyssinia affair, just as
it did nothing in the Manchuria
case. ‘

‘‘I am disappointed the United
States has taken no action.”

World Casting Aside Cyst
Of Popular Seif-Satisfaction

“The People” Forced To Abandon Decadent Ideals Still
In Search For Fundamentals Of Life

By Herrymon Maurer

OR A LONG time our civilization remained supremely self-satisﬁed, no
matter how ineiﬁciently it operated, no matter how poorly it cared for
the majority of people who lived under it, no matter how ineffectually it
attempted to provide concepts which might give meaning to the lives of the
people. But, as Bernard Shaw says, however long nature’s credits may be,
they must eventually be paid off.

Today in order to adjust our debts we have forced
ourselves to change our outlook. On the surface, per-
haps, all appears calm, but even that calm is frenzied.
Those persons whose professional function it is to deny
decadence a.re insanely assuring themselves that the
world is still in order. Ludwig Lewisohn’s defense of
the bourgeois, for instance, partakes more of hysteria
than of the stability which he ascribes to the third
estate. .

Those who can no longer rise in defense of their
age can do nothing but question its omnipotence. They
have suffered a loss of conﬁdence, conﬁdence not only
in the age itself but in the human basis which under-
lies any situation; today they wander around aimlessly,

Herrymon Maurer hoping against hope to ﬁnd some actuality which can
bring to troubled and confused minds some sense of calm, some sense of
stability.

Perhaps we might use the scientiﬁc questionings of Einstein as repre-
sentative of the new attitude. Scientiﬁc theory has never been exempt from
the inﬂuence of history; the science in which Darwin conﬁdently put his
faith is not the same science as the one which Einstein has surveyed; the
basic change of attitude comes not from progress toward greater knowledge,
though this may be an effect, but from the change of mind characteristic of
the years between Darwin and Einstein.

In all events, Einstein, the modern thinker, after looking at the uni-
verse, after examining it in terms of his own senses and his own feelings,
has conﬁdently asserted that the universe is not one simple and actual fact,
The universe is really multiple; there are as many universes as there are
points of reference, as there are attitudes. Bergson, who carried the idea
of the relative truth of science still further, proclaimed to a world anxious
for belief in inf-allibility the inability of scientiﬁc reasoning to achieve knowl-
edge.

At the same time literature, distrustful of itself and suspicious of the
world, retired into its own mind, and announced its own relativity by. saying
that an artistic production has meaning only for him who creates it. When
writers wrote intelligibly they drowned all activity in 3. flood of futility, or
ran off to the South Seas or to a past age to seek a security which they
could not ﬁnd at home.

Religion became either distrustful of its own dogmas or ﬁerce in shabby
defenses of them. And so distrust grew. It touched every institution. Tra-
ditional education was examined, condemned; progressive education was at-
tempted; even its worth was called in question. Prominent thinkers ques-
tioned the worth of the family as an educational and emotional institution.

More and more, distrust centered about the governmental-economic basis
of the civilization. Words that once only ﬁery labor leaders and prophetic
seers had dared to utter now appeared in standard periodicals. Philosophers
and ‘scientists assured -an-- already ’ j ittery“wo‘rld *-that capitalism ‘ could not’ take
care of its own members, that it either sentenced most of them to starva-
tion or led them out to slaughter each other.

At the same time the ideals upon which the age was built ceased to
command the respect of the people. Those ideals scared some persons by
forcing them to consider social and ﬁnancial success the ‘great achievements
of life; they oppressed others by not affording them opportunity for expres-
sion of feelings and ablities which they possessed; they ruined still others
by cutting loose their moorings and forcing them to drift over hostile foreign
land.

By 1914 the world was already beginning to swirl around the heads of
its inhabitants. People began to feel isolated, alone, lost without any guide
posts in a swirling, pushing vortex of meaningless and unconnected
phenomena. . .

The war heightened the confusion of minds already hysterical. The
dadaistic movement, functioning in an atmosphere of oppressive disillusion,
characterized the post-war days. This organization attacked every tradi-
tional concept, condemned every feature of its age, ﬂoundered about in a
state of confused lunacy. In their meetings dadaists howled and shrieked
their unhappiness to an unlieeding sky; then, worn out, they collapsed.

The depression descended upon a stricken world; it could not deepen
the despair; it could only force the attention of more people upon it.

If there is any ﬁgure representative of the twentieth-century confusion,
it is Paul Valery’s M. Teste, an exaggerated grotesque, no doubt, but a
ﬁgure made oppressive by elements of confusion, of lack of meaning, of
inactivity, of self—exami'nation and distrust all which Valery introduced into
his characters. There are persons, of course, who deny the existence of
M. Teste by aflirming a false idealism and mysticism. But there is more of
proof than of refutation in their attitude. There is much of M. Teste in each
one of us; those elements can be eradicated only by strongmedicine, not by
weak wish-fulﬁllment. 

An age hasidecayed, and now beneath us it is breaking apart; now it is
for us to clear away the debris and to begin the work of reconstruction.
Vvith what tools shall we work? VVho knows? We shall ﬁnd means only
through a recognition, based on experience, of the fundamentals which decay
cannot touch, and through understanding of the confusion of our own age
and its lack of meaning.

 

 

 

I Letters From Readers :_ :

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reference to your editorial of
March 11 concerning the National
Student League and its petition for
recognition‘ by the Student Faculty
Association, I would like to clear up
considerable doubt which seems to ex-

cern ourselves with such an arrange-
ment until the revised petition is act-
ually presented. Until the constitu-
tion is altered .to meet this ordinary
requirement‘, it is an impossibility to
pass upon the organization and grant
it a Pitt charter. Let it be clearly

ist with reference to the entire situa-
tion.

‘The National Student League in
its petition for recognition stated that
it was to be an organization consist-
ing of students and graduates of the
University of Pittsburgh, of Carnegie
Institute of Technology, and of Du-
quesne. As I mentioned in returning
the petition to its sponsors, it is con-
trary to the policy of the Student
Faculty Association to bestow the
sanction of the University of Pitts-
burgh upon any organization that
draws from three campus bodies. That
same attitude is maintained by the
Student Council of Carnegie Institute
of Technology and has been the pol-
icy with regard to recognition for
many years.

The Executive committee in return-
ing the petition indeed recognized
that the petitioning group was will-
ing to redeﬁne its membership and
draw only from the Pitt campus body.

However, obviously we cannot con-

understood that no extra regulations
are being imposed upon any group
of students eager to be sanctioned by
the SFA, and all that is required 
an ordinary compliance with the reg-
ulations formulatcd by the Urganiza-
tions committee at the beginning of
the school year. Copies of these
‘rules and regulations can be obtained
by any group at the Student Faculty
Association office, or at the office of
the Dean of Men at any time. When
these conditions are properly fulﬁlled,
then the petition can be validly con-
sidered.

dent Faculty Association.

Education Will
Bring ‘Good Life’
Thesis Of Lloyd

\ By Alan C. Lloyd

FEVV YEARS ago Chancellor

Bowman wrote for The Pittsburgh
Record that education was learning to

live, the making of students into
artists in the values of living. He
terminated his paper by saying, to
quote:

“The demand of this day upon
the colleges . is that every
teacher, from the lowest assistant
to the top, be himself and live the
ideal he would teach; that he have
character, scholarship, and human-
ity to vitalize his subject to his
students; that he count with sin-
cerity the effect he has upon their
lives.”

it It 2:

Most psychologists like to tell the
impressive story of the old Catholic
priest who said, “Give me a child for
his ﬁrst six years
and I’ll so train
him that nothing
can corrupt him
afterwards.” And
there are few who
wo uld challeng-2

the boast.
Dockeray gives

the psycliological

story. A man,

when he sees the
garments of his iii-
fant daughter
blaze, knows a.
“sudden impulse to
action.” He strips

Alan Lloyd the garments in an
instant, and at the same time shields
her face with his hand. I-Iis actions
are fairly well organized. Dockeray
says that, had the man’s previous
training been different, had he as a.
child never learned to react quickly
to situations, the daughter might have
been burned to death. On the other
hand, had his training been in strip-
ping blazing garments from people,
the actions might have been less vio-
lent and forceful.

=|< * *

Yet no psychologist will say that
we stop learning. The step from
elementary school to junior high, or
junior high to senior high, or from
there to college, does not mark the
end of the training period. If it did,
it would be useless to continue.

Dickens suggests endless possibili-
ties in his Fagan of Oliver Twist fame.
That nephew or young sister of yours
in grade schoo1—would you stand" for
a Fagan as teacher? As a matter of
fact, you probably wouldn’t even want
Fagan’s nephew in the same room
with yours. I am sure that most of
us would object to having children
reared and taught amid the smells of
the gutter. Perhaps this is why we
have social workers.

High school students, though, are
entirely different. They have healthy,
level ideas on most subjects. They
are eager to step into a profession of
their own choice. They are scrupu-
lous, and have by the time they reach
the ninth grade, or well, maybe the
twelfth, overcome the evils of parental
and environmental discouragement

. . false.

There are not many students who
receive such rigorous childhood train-
ing as to make them impervious to
the world. The high school boy or
girl must be helped, and there is no
one quite so apparently intended for
this position as the teacher.

Dr. Lessenberry, of the commer-
cial education department, gave em-
phasis to this point in an address
at a dinner given by the commercial
fraternity, Delta Delta Lambda. He
pointed out that it is the ‘duty of
commercial teachers to train stu-
dents in a new, honorable business
style, one which realizes that hu-
manity should come before personal
gain.

The importance of the teacher, as
I have sought to bring out above,
checks closely with a statement of Dr.
Yeager, recently quoted in The News,
to the effect that there should be a.
closer tie-up of the schools with the
social order. Teachers have a weapon
in the form of their own personality,
their bearing, their impressioiis, that
can be used for great good or evil
both socially and politically. Certain-
ly the national educational societies
could inflict upon the minds of the
next generation of voters certain prin-
ciples, even as Hearst is trying to do

with the present voters.

College students range from im-
mature )’0l«'ngsters to worldly adults.
The degree of discrimination varies
in the same proportions. For this
reason it is impossible to pursue a
middle course, as to educational
restriction. Should the school bring
flaring liberals before impression-
able minds, liberals that seem at-
tractive to the mature? Or should
the school bring the flat, textual
teacher to the young, and at the
same time disgust to those who find
constant fault with the standard
truisms of the existing order?

Panthers To Settle A Couple
Of Feuds At Morgantown

 

Cats Need Victory
To Capture Title
In Conference

 

By William K. Trosen

There comes a time when all
good things must come to an end.
In the case of Dr. Carlson and a
powerful Panther basketball
team, tonight’s the night when
Messrs. Cribbs, Hughes and com-
pany step in against a h1gh-step-
ping VVest Virginia ﬁve at Morgan-
town and bid adieu to a successful
1934-35 basketball season. Fittingly,
the ﬁnal game looms as one of the
most important battles of the season.
A Panther victory assures the Pitts-
burgh team of an undisputed East-
ern Intercollegiate conference title,
while a win for \Vest Virginia will tie
up the honors between the two teams.

In addition to closing the cage sea-
son, the game also winds up the
careers of three of the most brilliant
Panther stars in recent years. The
great Claire Cribbs, ﬁghting Skippy
Hughes, and the valuable substitute,
Slim W'ainio_. will toss basketballs for
the last time for the Panthers. For
the Mountaineers, only one player on
the varsity, Big Joe Stydahar, will be
appearing in the last act. Cribbs, who
was chosen on last year’s All-Ameri-
can cage team, has been again honor-
ed with a position on at least one of
this season's All-American teams, a.
team chosen by 60 of the country’s
leading basketball coaches.

Sleepy Glenn and his Mountaineers
face the Panthers tonight with more
than one reason for wishing to send
a pack of Panthers back to Pittsburgh
with their tails between their legs.
First comes the little matter of the
conference difference between the
two teams and then, the Mountaineers
can point rather timidly to the string
of nine straight defeats handed to
them during the last ﬁve years by
Panther teams. Top this off with the
bitter memories of the 35-34 whipping
the Mountaineers received from the
Panthers in Pittsburgh recently and
it puts Sleepy’s boys in just the pro-
per mood to welcome the Golden Cats
to Morgantown.

Recently, Glenn has had his team
clicking together with all the preci-
sion of a Sutherland-coached football
team. The Mountaineers have won
every game since their lop-sided loss
to Temple at Philadelp-hia over six
weeks ago.

West Viirginia swamped the Hoyas of
Georgetown. 43-13, and literally mur-
dered Washington and Jeﬁerson last
Saturday, 65-16.

The Mountaineer lineup will remain
the same as the one used in Pitts-
burgh in January against the Pan-
thers. At the forwards Coach Glenn
will probably place Al Colebank and
Jack Gocke, a pair of high scoring
courtmen. Captain Joe Stydahar will
pit his six feet, four inches at center
against the Cats’ Pete Noon, while
teaming at guards will be Andy Mes-
trovic and Johnny Phares, crack de-
fensive men.

Coach Carlson will probably not
take a. chance on starting a senior
team. but will stick to his usual ﬁve
starters. Co-captain Skippy Hughes
and Ted Roderick will play opposite
the VVest Virginia guards. Big Pete
Noon will be at center, while the
guards will be taken care of by the
Panthers’ unbeatable combination,
Co-captain Claire Cribbs and sopho-
more Ross Emrick.

Scholofl“Bfoy Meet
Set For Saturday

Annual Interscholastics Attract
Large Number of Entries

The twenty-ﬁrst annual Interscho-
lastic swimming meet sponsored by
the University will be held Saturday,
March 16, at Trees Pool. To date
over 200 entry blanks have been re-
ceived and the meet promises to be
the largest one ever scheduled. High-
schools from.‘ Western Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and VVest Virginia have already
signiﬁed their intention of entering
the meet.

The trial events will take place be-
ginning at 1:30 in the afternoon and
the ﬁnals will be held starting at 8
o’clock in the evening.

It is expected that a large number
of 1‘cC01‘dS will be broken when the
high school boys begin their assault
on them. Fifth Avenue high school
of Pittsburgh is the advance favorite
to cop the meet. The Fifth Avenue
team has won eight straight meets
this year including a victory over the
Panther freshmen. Their relay team
is undefeated as yet, and they possess
considerable strength in the back-
stroke and freestyle events.

The University individual swimming
championships will be held in con-
junction with the Interscholastic
meet.

Among the entrants are Stinner and
Ruhe in the sprints, Swazuk and
Stiranka in the breaststroke, Denny
and Lindberg in the freestyle events,
Lindb-erg in the backstroke and
sprints, l\=lcQuillan and Myers in the
diving events, and Lewis, Jones and
Denny in the longer races.

The annual event staged for the
district high schools is perhaps the
most popular meet of its kind. Every
year the entry lists grow larger and
the competition becomes keener as
the high school lads ﬁght it out for
supremacy in the water events.

A counterpart to this affair is
planned by Coach Carl Olson as a
grand track and ﬁeld contest for the
secondary school boys. This year the
meet is scheduled for Saturday, March
30, at the Pitt track house. Olson has
already received numerous entry
blanks and expects this year’s affair
to top even the most successful one of
last year.

Boxers Seek To Mar
Fine Mountaineer
Ring Records

By Thomas F. Pellow

Coach Jack Schricker’s Pitt
boxers will leave this morning
for Morgantown where they will
meet the “lest Virginia Moun-
taineers in a preliminary attrac-
tion to the Pitt-West Virginia
basketball game this evening.

Smarting under the defeat inﬂicted
upon them by Navy Saturday night,
the Panthers are determined to re-
sume their winning stride. The Pitt
punchers displayed a decided improve-
ment against the Naval Academy over
the showing they made against the
Wisconsin Badgers, and, "but for a
series of tough breaks, the decision
might well have gone the other way.

All of the boys came out of the
Navy match in good shape with the
exception of Joe Kopp, who suffered
a but cut over his eye. Kopp has been
handicapped by tough luck all year
and will be unable to ﬁght for the re-
mainder of the season because of the
stitches which are necessary to heal
the injury‘. Coach Schricker is ex-
pecting Linderman to take Kopp's
place if he can make the weight.

The Mountaineers, who are coach-
ed by Edward Vacharesse, this year
are enjoying one of the best seasons
in the history of the ring sport at
the school. To date they have defeat-
ed Bucknell, Duquesne, VVestern
Maryland, and Carnegie Tech. Their
closest match was with VVestern Mary-
land, whom they defeated 5-3.

Coach Vacharesse has an aggres-
sive, rugged team, and most of his
ﬁghters have had at least two years
of varsity experience. They are cap-
tained by Pete Puglia, who began the
season as a bantamweight, but who
has fought in the 115-pound class in
the last two matches. ‘

One of the feature events on the
card should ‘be the bout in the 135-
pound class between Captain Jimmy
Giannatti of Pitt and Vacharesse, the
VVest Virginia lightweight. Giannatti,
who earned a draw with Blitch of the
Navy in his last appearance, will be
seeking his sixth victory. Vacharesse,
who to date has chalked up two
knockouts in four bouts, “possesses
dynamite in his ﬁsts which bodes ill
for the Panther captain.

Bernie Speigel will attempt to re-
sume his winning streak which was
shattered in the Navy match, when
he meets Ferrari, the West Virginia

welterweight. The fans were of the
opinion that Speigel held the edge
over Hooker, his Middie opponent,

despite the fact that the Navy boy was
awarded the verdict. Ferrari, who is
in -his ﬁrst year of intercollegiate
competition, won his last ﬁght when
he was awarded the decision over
Restaing of Carnegie Tech.

The probable line-ups are:

Pitt w. Va.
115-pounds——Sivak . . . . . . . . . . . Puglia
125-pounds——Paslowski . . . . . . . . Welch
135-pounds—Giannatti . . . . Vacheresse

dium, but this coming meet will be an
Intercollegiate league match with the
Tech boys shooting in their own
range and the Panthers in their home
quarters. Scores will be compared
and the winner announced either late
Saturday or on Sunday.

The next varsity postal league meet
will also take place on Saturday with
the riﬂemen meeting Michigan. The
ROTC team will also have a match
with Louisiana State, Idaho, and Cor-
nell.

As a. matter of record, the results
of the Pitt-Tech match are being pub-

the outcome of last night's playoff.
Phi Kappa lost by a 30-12 margin in
the regular game, but secured a re-

Pace Three

Milers To Enter
Chicago Relays

Olson Takes Six-Man Team West
For Armour Tech Meet

Chicago track fans will get a chance
to see Coach Carl Olson’s fast step-
ping mile-relay team in action Satur-
day when the baton-passers toe the
mark for their favorite event in the
seventh annual Armour Tech relays
at the University of Chicago ﬁeld
house.

In addition to the relay team,
Olson will probably take along a few
other track and ﬁeld stars. Arvel
Fleming who did spectacular work in
the CIC meet last Saturday will enter
the 70-yard dash and low hurdles
events. In last year’s meet, he won
the low hurdles and took a third in
the dash. Pelucha who pole vaulted
13 feet, 3 inches last Saturday and
who ﬁnished in a tie for third in last
winter's Tech relays will attempt to

better his standing in this coming
meet.
Oth~:-.r men making the trip will

probably include Menaker, Bonavita,
who captured second place in the shot
last year in Chicago, Kirkpatrick, and
Wagenhouser or Musico.

In each of the last two Armour
meets, the relay team has hung up
two new marks. In 1933, they estab-
lished a record of 3 minutes, 23.5 sec-
onds for the mile, and this latter mark
was bettered by .6 of a second last
year. On the basis of last Saturdays
showing, the Kiger, Groat, MacDonald,
Connelly team should change their
present Armour Tech mark.

The team will leave Friday morn-
ing for the Vvindy City,

An innovation was presented at
Monday night's session of the Retail
Institute, a six-weeks’ course given
by the Research Bureau for Retail

ical slant,” and discussed the custom-
er traits of impulsiveness, deliberate-
ness, indecision, decision, talkative-
ness, silence and suspicion.

Customers showing these traits buy
for the motives of self-preservation.
possession, companionship, pride, im-
itation, curiosity, and parental rea-
sons, according to Miss Ely.

After describing each type of cus-
tomer and each customer trait, Miss
Ely: explained. the methods best used
for each customer. Following her
talk, she spoke informally on slides
taken from the New Yorker which
showed interesting and sometimes
embarrassing phases of the customer-
salesman relation.

Ides Of March
Scorned As YW
Members Frolic-

Did you get out of bed on the wrong
side this morning, or have you broken
a mirror recently? If so, you are in
the mood to attend the YWCA “Ides
of March" party on the 36th ﬂoor of
the Cathedral this afternoon at 3:30
o’c‘lock'L - - -

YVV mernbers and sophomore and
junior non-members who care to at-
tend. undaunted by the superstitious
date—the 13th——will boldly duck under
a ladder in order to prove their non-
superstitious mettle.

hiembers of the organization who
have planned the party spent a
greater part of the last few days in
dropping forks, in the hope that a.
large group would turn out; others
have emptied salt cellars over their
left shoulders to keep evil spirits
away.

It is just possible that guests will
have to gaze over‘ their left shoulders
at a large paper moon or march be-
hind an army of black cats.

But t.o deal more speciﬁcally with
the Ides of M.arc.h, a parody on the
death of Julius Caesar will be pre-
sented and Roman refreshments will

 

be served.

Horseshoes will be placed upside
down, but care will be taken to see
that there will be only slight possibili-
ties of the shoes ifalliiig. And if they
should fall—they're only paper.

Taken all in all, it would seem as
though only brave, hardened people
would appeal‘ at the Ides of March
party, but the rarnpus YVVCA invites
any interested upper-class students to
lake the risk.
