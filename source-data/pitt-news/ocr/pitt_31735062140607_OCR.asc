ing before attaining the present
draft age.”

Pitt freshmen who will debate
and serve as critics in the ﬁrst
round are Richard C. Briney, C,

plans for their annual high school tournament, held tomorrow morning
and afternoon at the University. Attracting over 400 debaters, critics,
and coaches, tomorrows’ event is expected to be the biggest in the his-

tory of the tournament.

SPA Plans Assemblies

To Use Commons Room

In an attempt to increase stu-
dent use of the Commons room,
Student—Faculty association plans
to sponsor student assemblies, fea-
turing University and: outside en-
tertainment conducted every Wed-
nesday during activities hour.

Roy Ruane, C42, president of
SFA, said, “We have a two-fold
purpose in sponsoring these assem-
blies. Primarily we wish to create
a greater interest in the Commons
r-oom for the student body. It is in-
tended to be the center of Univer-
sity social activities, yet,' aside
from those who use the tables
there for studying, few persons use
the room for its intended purpose
—that of a social gathering place.”

“Secondly,” he continued, , “the

assemblies will interest the stu-
dents in the University groups that
will perform .every Wednesday.
Many have never had an opportu-

nity to hear, for example, the
women’s choral, the concert band,
the Glee club, or the University or-
chestra. This will offer them an
opportunity to acquaint themselves
with the work of these groups and
will stimulate an interest in each
organization.”

In addition to Pitt organizations,
SFA intends to provide outside en-
tertainment. furnished by local tal-
ent or visiting groups and individ-
uals.

The SFA book drive, now in the

middle of its third week, has again ‘

been extended, Ralph Hines, Ed42,
co-chairman of the drive, stated
today.

“Although books have been
coming in quite well, the commit-
tee believes that the supply is far
from exhausted,” he declared.
“Therefore we have once again
extended the drive to the last
school week before Christmas.

“In the meantime, we will con-
tact all school activities and organ-
izations to ask for contributions.
will be set

h .

 

E9

ternities vs. sororities competition
will be held.”

The receiving center, moved
Monday to the ground ﬂoor eleva-
tor lobby, will accept donations
daily from 9 to 4:30 o’clock, Hines
added. he University bookstore,
cooperating with the committee,
will also receive books during the
regular store hours.

In response to last Wednesday's
plea of Billy Anne Swank, C42,
organization manager of the Owl,
all of the eight groups scheduled
for pictures appeared on time.
Billy is hoping and praying that
this new record is upheld today
and hereafter.

In view of the record just estab-
lished, Billy has no doubt (well,
not much) that every one of the
following organizations will appear
at 24 Cathedral on time today;

12:30 Delta Tau Delta

12:45 Chi Omega
1:00 Sigma Alpha Epsilon
1:15 Alpha Epsilon Phi
2:30 Delta Phi Epsilon

Old-Newsboy Drive _

Apron-clad “upperclassmen newsboys” will penetrate

Volume 33 Number 30 all parts of the campus Monday as representatives of the

annual University old-newsboy drive to beneﬁt crippled

children.

The entire proceeds of the drive, sponsored by Pitt Stu-
dent Faculty association, will be turned over to the Children’s
hospital for aid to crippled children. The paper, offered for
sale by 30 upperclass student leaders, will be a special edition
printed and donated by the Pittsburgh Press.

Aldo Icardi, C43, and Betty Sapp, C42, co-chairmen of
the project, announced that the drive last year netted $140.81,
more than four times as much as any other university or

college in Pittsburgh.

“We hope,” says Miss Sapp,
make this year’s campaign the most successful.

The opening campaign of

“to exceed that amount and

U

the series, started in 1935, col-

lected less than thirty dollars. Last year nearly 1500 issues

were sold at an average price

of nine cents.

“The disposal of all the papers at an average sale price
of 10 cents,” says Icardi, “plus individual contributions of
any denominationiwill more than please us.” _

The drive is entirely apart from all others and will be

carried out on campus only.

Photographs of Draftees
To Be Included ln Owl

Seniors who face a prospective draft call and who have not bought
a yearbook are assured of having their picture in the Owl if they make

the deposit tod

John Broiiiy, C42, editor, stating that the senior sales campaign
ends today, declared that this decision to include draftees in the 

was made possible by the high per-
centage of seniors who have al-
ready purchased a yearbook, and
by the desire of the Owl staff to
do their share in National Defense
morale building.

Senior men who have been noti-
ﬁed by their Selective Service
boards that a draft call is imminent
are now assured of the inclusion of
thei pictures and activities in the
1942 Owl. Any senior man or wom-
an who has not puchased the book
and had his or her picture taken
at Photo Reﬂex studio can still do
so today.

Deposits on the yearbook will
be accepted until 6 o’clock tonight
in the office, 803 Cathedral, and
picture sittings at Photo Reflex stu-
dio will be made until tomorrow.

Referring to the “Most Photoge-
nic Hands” contest concluded two
weeks ago, Brosky explained that
ﬁnalists will meet next week for
the ﬁnal judging by the ﬁne arts
department. Eleanor Mitchell and
Reid Hastie of the ﬁne arts de-
partment will notify the ﬁnalists of
the time and place of the judging.

The Owl received today, Brosky
added, the diploma which was
awarded to the 1941 yearbook in

' the twenty-ﬁrst National Yearbook

contest. “This is the ﬁrst time,”
Brosky explained, “thatiwe receiv.
red the diploma. Usually we are

merely notiﬁed of our standing in“

the contest.” The 1941’,Owl received
a ﬁrst class rating in the judging

How the Japanese ﬁt into the
world picture of war is just as,in-
teresting. Some people think the
"President does not disfavor giving
hell to Japan, since. it would give
the Navy “practice -in action”
. they've been awaiting 43 years.

But strangely enough Germany

— and England are even more inter-

ested in our ﬁghting Japan. The
Germans think such a war would
tie-up and/or divert American pub-
lic interest. The British think pull-
ing us into any war anywhere

‘would pull us into the European

war, which every correspondent re-

turning from England says they .

want to do. _
The only people that didn't
seem to want the Japs to light the
Americans are the Japs. They still
want to’ talk. _ »
We think the secret of this whole
thing is thatlthe Jap government

‘knows it’s ﬁghting a losing battle;

‘they also have the delusion that a
"German victory would in some in-
conceivable way bring a Jap vic-
tory. . .—
The Japs aren’t sure of a.Ger—
man victory; (even Dr. Goebbels’

them, on this. point). So they are

in PAUL E. PFIsCHNER_

Everything from‘ strikes to wom-
en’s clothes can be found in the
news from other campuses today.

Last week neighbor college stu-

\ dents from Westminster went on a

strike. A false rumor that the col-
lege president was to be replaced
caused it. ’ C

After rumors swept the campus ,

that Dr. Robert F. Galbreath was
to be dismissed as "college presi-
dent, the students refused to enter
the classrooms, but Dr. Galbregth
invited the strikers to a mass meet-
v ing in the college auditorium and
,_ informed them he hadn't been dis-
, missed, and wasn’t going to be.
Giving the president a cheer, the
students went back to their classes.

Two sophomore men were re-
covering today from serious burns
received last week when they were
pushed accidently into a campus
bonﬁre preceding the California-
Stanfond football game.

As members of the California
university rally committee, they
tried to prevent an over-zealous
group of students from putting a
wooden barricade on the ﬁre.

Courses in first aid for all stu-
dents will be part of the Muhlen-
berg college program after the first
of the year. President Levering
Tyson said it was another move on
the part of the liberal arts college
to prepare its students for an ac-

’ tive part in America's defense pro-
gram. . _

Facts and traditions in the his-
tory of their own college have been
offered to Hollins college student
in advanced composition work.

The writing class seized upon
the idea that in the vaults of Hol-
lins lay a large collection of docu-
ments, letters, reports, and me-
mentos of bygone college days

’ - which could be used for articles
and stories.

Bernard M. Kellmurray, ‘fresh-
man adviser at Yale university, sat
in his room today and said, “How
women’s clothes have changed!”

He had regained his sight after ﬁve _

years of total blindness.
Kelmurray was stricken in 1936
while working for the Department
of Interior in Washington, - and

Several weeks ago objects began
to, be distinguishable to his left
eye, and within a few days the
sight of his right eye was restored.
No explanation could be offered
for the restoration of his eyesight
which was lost due to a retina
disease.

He was amazed at the changes,
particularly in women’s fashions.
He noted_that they appeared “less
feminine,” but had “more curves”
than ﬁve years ago.

Railroads Offer  
Student Rates
On Holiday Trips

With a tremendous number of
Uncle _Sam’s army expected to
travel overithe holidays on military
furloughs, railroad officials are
urging students to travel to and

from their homes before December
17 and after January 7.

Plans‘ are already under way to
take care of the lalrge volume of
student traffic, by issuing “College
Special" fares which offer substan-
tial savings when the round-trip
ticket is purchased in the student's
home town for the trip to college
and return.

‘Those students who already have A

return portions of “College Spe-
cials" purchased in the fall, are
urged to use them on the trip from
college to home and buy a new
ticket before coming back to col-
lege. The return portion of this
ticket can be used at Easter or at
the end of the school year.

For those who have no ticket
now, it is cheaper to purchase a
one-way ticket to their“ homes in
order to secure the beneﬁts of the

~ new ticket which can only" be
bought in the home town.
Students, faculty members and
staff members of colleges and uni-
versities and other educational in-
stitutions throughout the country
are eligible. Reductions are obtain-
able for the use of Pullman accom-
modations when used in connection
with these “College Specials.”

This adaptation of Lillian Hell-
man's unforgettable play is horri-
ble to sit through, but Sam Gold-
wyn has given it a masterful pro-
duction and Bette Davis and a first-
rate cast interpret it excellently.
Miss Davis, by the way, has never
been better. As Regina Geddens,
shrewish bourgeois Southern lady,
she ﬁnally has a role worthy of her
integrity as an actress.

"Sergeant York”

If you haven’t seen this fine
American movie, then by all means
hop off to—see_ it. Some of it _is
hammy, and there are scenes that
will insult your intelligence, but on

 

the whole it's one of the ﬁnest
“mass consumption” movies ever
made.» There is nothing arty or
pretentious about “Sergeant York;”
it’s just fine old American home-
spun.

”The Scoundrel"

The “Scoundrel” with Noel Cow-
ard and Julie Haydon was obvious-
ly intended to be some sort of mor-

alizing about God's place in the ~'_

some obsolete New York company
produced the picture, which ex-

plains its ﬂop. Hollywood, movie- ‘
wise Hollywood, should have done 

the job.

I In the thirties the skirts began
to grow longer and straighter. They

make up our mind whether they
looked like a street dress that had
stretched or an evening_ gown that
had shrunk. Actually they looked
like nothing and the women who
iilvore them looked the same.

Freshman Units Prepare

Board Activity Schedule

By N0nMA JONso_N
Freshman unit members have

been some of the busiest people on
campus these past _days——planning
new programs and breaking in
newly-elected oﬂicers. ' From Ber-
nadette Blatt, C42, chairman of the
entire unit organization,iwe learn
that the units have already held
their ﬁrst meetings under the new

O‘ chairmen.

Ada Block, C, was elected chair-
«man of the Acting unit. Under her
V leadership ‘the group expects to

study the latest plays and play pro-
duction, and will produce a series
of short skits.

The amateur photographers in
the Camera Arts unit plan to photo-
graph various freshmen and fresh-
men events. These photos will lat-
er be put on display. They have
selected as theirchairman, Marcia
Chandler, C.

There willbe much ado for the
Publications unit, what with their

‘ intent to publish in miniature, a

miineographed Pitt News, an Owl
and a Panther. »That’s quite a job,

-but with Elizabeth Pilgrim as their

chairman, they hope to-succeed.

The Christmas Decorations and
table settings. and window displays
that the Arts and Crafts unit is
planning to make, constitute an-
other line of activity. When the
holiday displays are complete, they
intend to make jewelry. Helen
Hadgis, C, has been elected to the
chairmanship.

The Books and Plays unit has
-just made Unis Latshaw their lead-
er and are planning to read, dis-
cuss andicriticize the more popular
plays. They will have several
theatre parties at the Nixon and
the Pittsburgh Playhouse.

The future program of the Music
Unit, ofwhich Lucille Morgan is
chairman, is indeﬁnite. They are
now practicing group singing, and
choral speaking. _ .

Something democratic is brew-
ing in the Sports unit. They are
planning a program in which all
the units can participate. They
also promise to hold their usual
Play Day program in the Trees
gym. . Marcella Strutzel, C, is
chairman.

“More and better speakers” is
the theme of the Speech unit. Un-
der the leadership of chairman Jo-
sephine Fagnani, C, they are prac-
ticing public speaking, choral

Planetarium Shows C'h1°1'stmas     

Scene, Sidérostat Telescope

By HARRIET BAUER it 

Each year at Christmas time,
people all over the city ﬂock to the
Buhl Planetarium to hear’ the old
story of the Bethlehem Star told in
a new, scientiﬁc, yet moving way.

To the hushed throng of people
gathered under a most realistic
bowl of dark sky, time wheels
back two thousand years and once
more a brilliant light flashes across
the sky, while a quiet voice tells
the story of the Christ-child.

Less widely-known, no less ef-
fective drama goes on in a small,
tiled room near the “Theater of the
Stars.”

There, bent starlight is caught
by a powerful telescope, and held
for study by scientists and the lay-
man.

The telescope, only one of its
kind open to the public, unlike
other such instruments, never

' moves.
- A giant mirror, set under a panel
in the roof which slides back to
reveal the sky, does the moving.
Powered by nine electric motors,
the mirror catches the light of any
star or planet, and bends it afound
the corner into the telescope.

Once the desired star has been
found, the image is not lost as
time passes, for the mirrorqis me-
chanically adjusted to rotate in
time with the earth's movement.

The one and a half ton instru-
ment is called a siderostat tele-
scope, and took ﬁve months to de-
sign, two years to build.

Observers remain in a warm
room next to the one where the gi-
gantic telescope is.kept. The slid-
ing roof above the telescope is
opened at night for visitors, is kept
closed during daylight hours.

Buhl Planetarium, built in 1939
at a cost of more than a million
dollars, has beenivisited by 900,000
people who have seen the drama of
the skies. The structure includes
the Theater of the Stars, the Peo-
ple’s Observatory, and the Octagon
Gallery.

The Planetarium is “dedicated
to, the popular understanding of
astronomy and natural sciences.”
To do that, exhibits in the Octagon
Gallery are changed to keep
abreast of science in the news to-
day. “Theatre of the Stars” shows
are changed each month so that in
a year the entire heavens are cov-
ered.

Arthur L. Draper,‘ lecturer in
astronomy at the University, con-
ducts a series of lectures on the
Survey of Astronomy every Thurs-
day evening. The course includes
demonstrations with special em-
phasis given to a study of the con-
struction of the instrument.

The People’s observatory which
houses the new siderostat tele-
scope, the second of its kind in
America, was built and equipped
at a cost of $30,000.

“Can America be bombed?” is
a question answered now at the
Planetarium. On exhibition in the
Octagon Gallery is a series of gi-
ant maps, dioramas, scale models
of modern military aircraft, globes,
and story-telling charts. This ex-

P1’ tt Forum
To Present

Union Head

Current labor problems and their
effect onthe labor policies of to-
day will be discussed at Pitt Town
meeting Monday when, Clinton S.
Golden, northeastern regional di-
rector of the Steel Workers Organ-
izing committee, speaks on “Labor
and National Defense” in 208 Ca-
thedral.

Chairman of the meeting which
begins at 2:30 /o’clock, will be
Harry Lanfer, C42, executive-com.
mittee member, of PTM.

The Pitt victory celebration of
November 10 prevented Mr. Golden
from speaking at the Pitt Town
meeting scheduled for that day.

Golden began his labor activi-
ties in 1904 when he joined the
Locomotive Fireman's brother-
hood. After becoming affiliated
with several labor‘ unions as their
representative in conventions, he
later joined ex-governor Pinchot’s
administrative force as a senior la-
bor administrator.

In 1935 and 1936 he served as
director of the NLRB in western
Pennsylvania. During the last CIO
convention Golden was reelected to
the vice-presidency,‘ the post he
held l.ast year.

Pitt Cagers Meet Semi-Pros

ln Preparation For Campaign "

Continuing to face the city’s out-
standing semi-pro talent, the Blue
and Gold basketball squad is get-
ting ready to taper off as the open-
ing of the new ‘season gets nearer.
Last night they played the strong
Young Republican club of the Mu-
nicipal league. Twolformer Pitt
stars, Don Smith and Bob John-
son played for the semi-pro club,
as did Manny Hyatt, brother of the
famous Charley Hyatt.

The showing of the Panther
squad thus far has been v_ery grati-
fying to Dr. Carlson, ‘for last Wed-
nesday he stated, “We look like
we're going to have a good ball
club this season.” He went on to
say that although this year's squad
may not ‘have outstanding ability,
they have the necessary emotional
drive and spirit to produce a win-
ning. team. V V V .

According to" Carlson this spirit
and". ﬁght is, “The lighting up or
vitalizing of“ ability and ’ endur-
ance.” The team has the will to
win, and what they lack in ability
will be more than made up in their
determination" to win.

Starting‘ with their ﬁrst game i

against Northwestern, December
20, the Panthers face four strong

teams within two weeks and Will“

have completed one-fourth of their
schedule in that time. Regardless
of this, they’ll be ready to do their
best in the opinion‘ of Carlson.
Following the opening tilt with
the Wildcats in Evanston, the Pan-
thers travel to Butler, Indiana, to
take on the Butler squad. Butler
always floors a strong team, and if
the local boys can come through
with _a win over both Northwestern
and the Indiana school, the great
season Dr. Carlson is looking for-
ward to, willbe in the making.

guests for the evening, and then“
four nights later the “Big Red" of "

Cornell university will appear on
the Stadium ﬂoor.

These four games will give the
local fans and Carlson an indica-
tion‘ of just what the remaining
three—quarters of the season will be
like. Wins in all four contests, or
three out of the four, will fulﬁll
preseason expectations, but if they
go the other way all of Carlson’s
optimism will have been for naught.

Co-captains
and Larry Paffrath, Tay Malarky,
Jimmy Egan and Bobby‘ Artman
continue to make up the starting
five ‘at this stage of the practice
sessions,'and it is likely that these
five will be the starting quintet
when the season opens. Steve Shu-
ber is the first relief man, while
sophomore Walter Jones has come
along fast and has moved up close
to the first five.

Jones is a perfect example of
what Carlson meant when he spoke
about spirit and the will to win.

Despite the fact that this sea-
son's football squad emerged from
the gridiron battes with a rather
spotty record of only three victories
against six defeats, it nevertheless
produced its usual amount of grid
stars. As in past years the Panthers.
always succeed in uncov,ering a few
stars who gained national recogni-
tion. This year was no exception.

around play of;
Edgar “the mail
man” Jones, at
vtracted the atten
tion of the foot-'
ball hierarchy of
the country.

Fife was the
“Rock of Gib- . ,. V
1-altar" on the line. In every game
it ’was Ralph who was in the ene-
my's backﬁeld to pull down the
swivel-hipped ball carriers through-
out most of the sixty minutes of
the contests. It was this type of
play that won for Fife the praise
of almost every coach and player
he met. . .

“Sleepy” Jim Crowley, mentor of
the powerful Fordham Rams, even
in.his extreme grief and despair af-
ter ~the»Jungle Cats -upset his; highly
touted eleven, remarked, f‘;T.hat boy
Fife is the best linemanll haveseen
all «year—bar none.;”V This ‘coming
from someone whofhas met the top

notch‘, teams of. the country is in-1

" deed a feather in‘ Capt, Ralph's, cap.

.,Crowley, however,‘ was not the

only one who thought the “Can-
ton Ki ” worthy of recognition.
The numerous “All American"
lists published these past‘ two weeks
placed Fife on their squad with

monotonous regularity.

The NEA, one of the most au-

thentic of the numerous “All-Elev-
ens” in that is selected by the com-
posite vote of newspapermen,
scouts, oﬁicials, etc., placed the
Panther star on their second team.
Ted Husing, veteran sports an-

nouncer and football authority for a

CBS, honored Fife in a similar
manner by also placing him on his
second team. ’ .

Besides placing high on these

famous squads Fife was chosen on
the UP second eleven and received
honorable mention on William Ran-
dolph Hearst’s select team. To add
a perfect ﬁnish to Ralph Fife’s bril-
liant career, he has been picked by

-Andy Kerr and Bernie»Bierman to

represent the East in the annual
East-West classic-in San Francisco
on New Year's Day.

Perhaps the most publicized
man on the Pitt squad has been
Edgar Jones. The Special Deliv-

* ery ﬂash came toithe Sky Scraper
School House with press accounts
that predicted “surefire” acclaim

- for the Scranton lad. “Special De-
livery” Jones didn't set the world,
afire in his first two years here for
he failed to live up to any of his

_« numerous publicity buildups.

This year, however, the “Mail-
man” ﬁnally arrived—-—by airmail. It
was Jones who led the Jungle Cats

to their stunning upset victory over
the powerful Fordham Rams. One
week later it was Edgar again. who
turned a certain defeat into’ a~glori-
ous victory when he intercepted a
Nebraska pass and scampered 75
yards for a touchown. Thirty sec.
onds later ‘Special Delivery almost
repeated the stunt but this time he
was stopped just three yards short
of pay dirt. Jones’ all around. of-
fensive play was the bright spot of
the Panther squad.

Edgar" shared natioiial fame
withhis teammate ~Ralph Fife, re-
ceiving honorable mention on the
Hearst, and United Press all Amer-
ica teams. In addition to this he is
one of Carl Snavely’s choices to
play in N orth-South game on
Christmas day. Thus the collegiate
gridiron pictures close for two of
the most outstanding players in
Pitt’s history. ‘

Eddie Ziolkowski ,

  
   

By JERRY RIPP , _ .
It's quiet up on the hill behind

the stadium now. ‘ The intramural
footballers have reached the end
of another tough grind. However,
the echo still remains; the echo of

-one of the greatest intramural sea-

sons in Pitt's history.

When the fall season started, it
gave promise of being a great cam-
paign, and then from the ‘opening
day to ﬁnal triumph by the cham-
pion Punks, it fulﬁlled that prom-
ise.

Running hand in hand with this

top notch season was the excellent

. showing made by the Punks. For

the third successive year the Punks

ended up on. top of the intramural

heap, but this year they really at-

tained the heights of intramural
football. ,

The record they compiled this
year wasn’t -great, it was thought
to be impossible. In six games they
ran up a total of 226 points, an av-
erage of better than 37 «points per
contest. Throughout the entire
season‘ they-were forced to give up
the ball by punting only once,and
that came in their ﬁnal game.

Led by Eddie Ziolkowski, the ,

Punks smothered every team they
faced, and then bottled them up
completely on the defense. The
fact that they weren’t scored upon
gives you some indication as to the
great defense they had.

The Punks lose Ziolkowski, Lar-
ry Paffrath and Ralph Josephs
through graduation. The first two
were the main parts of the Punks
deadly offense, while Josephs was
a bear on the defense. Their loss
creates three big holes to be ﬁlled
for next year, but leave. it to the
Punks, they’ll find someone to take
over those spots.

There 1 were other good teams
that played this year, but they

' were overshadowed completely by

a team that was ‘probably the

PunIcFoot.ba1IersTe1°med      
Greatest In I-M History Basketba" P|a

greatest combination to play on an
intramural ﬁeld at Pitt. The Punks
are kings again, and this year they
are real ‘kings’.

ACompetition in the fraternity
league this year was /keener than
ever. No one team ended the sea-
son with a clean slate, wi the
championship ending in a rea dog
fight between the Phi Eps, who
ﬁnally won the ’Greek crown, and
PiKA. L

These two teams met for the ﬁrst

time in midseason, -with PiKA
swamping the Neville street team,
33-7. When the season ﬁnally end-
ed the Phi Eps had to face the then
undefeated PiKA’s again. This
.time the Phi Eps rose" up and_ held
their. previous vanquishers to one
touchdown ,while they were scored
two.

Thus another game between
these two teams was made neces-
sary, and once again the Phi Eps
were equal to the occasion as they
beat the PiKA’s again, and won
the fraternity . championship which
was just about out of their reach.

The thing that made the Phi
Ep triumphs so outstanding was the
fact that they were facing a team
that had already beaten them, and
had beaten them badly. They came
through in the fact of big odds,

, and were justly crowned the fra-
ternity loop’s ' titleholders.

The engineering league race was
close too, but not as close as that
in the fraternity circuit. Here it
was a case of whether it would be
the -AE&ME seniors» or the AE&

‘ME frosh and sophs that would,

win out. The seniors ended their
season with a spotless record, as
they administeredtwo defeats to
their younger brethren.

And so the intramural football
season is over, but the echo of the
greatest season ever seen here re-
mains.

raternities

With intramural football, speed-
abll, badminton and paddle tennis

safely tucked away until next fall,
-the winter

intramural -‘program
gets underway next week, with the
same four sports that were offered
last year holding the spotlight
again this season. They include
basketball, volleyball, table tennis
and bowling.

Basketball, of ‘course, gets most
of the attention, for the frater-
nities, independents and engineers
all put out good clubs. Last year

In preparation for their annual
series. of postal and shoulder-to-
shoulder matches with some of the
most formidable aggregations in
the collegiate circle, the Pitt riﬂe

team is really “shooting the works”
these days. .

Just what kind of matches these
are is, no doubt, a mystery to most
of you students; therefore, they
are explained as follows:

The postal matches, in which
the participating colleges actually
do not meet, are by far the most
common. These consist of teams’
shooting scores compiled and mail-
ed to the ‘various colleges. After
all the -scores. have been tabulated,
the winner is decided. J

On the other hand, the partici-
pants do meet» in the shoulder-to-
shoulder matches. /Naturally, these
are much. more interesting than
those via the mail.

The football season is oﬁicially

over. The all-Americans have been
selected and disagreed with; the
«bowl teams have been chosen and
disagreed with; and the second
guessers have convened and dis-
agreed with period.

But, while the season is over the
post mortems go on. Just now the
question of the hour is why do
people go to football games. The
simple answer is that they like it.
But what is there about it that
imakes them like it enough to
brave even the most miserable of
weather conditions.

Baseball is the most considerate
of its fans not to mention its play-
ers. Wet grounds, a temperature
of less than 70 degrees, or a mild
drizzle is enough to cause the post-
ponement of the game. The’ hockey
spectator endures —_ nothing worse
than the possibility of being acci-
dentally slashed over the head with
a hockey stick or purposely slash-
ed over the head with a hockey
stick because one of the players
decided, he didn’t like his attitude.

Football, on- the other hand, is
as hard on: the spectators (they
sit on benches, too) as it is on the

players. The -fan usually watches.

football under weather’ conditions
that are such that, as one fan put
it, “a dog wouldn’t go outin it,-—
only a football fan." For his pains
the fan’s only tangible »_reward is
likely to be a pair of frozen toes
or ears.

Yet ﬁfty-ﬁve thousand soaked

and shivering fans sat in a combi-
nation rain and -snow storm to

Why Do You Go To A Football Besihlntensive

Game? Qureies Frantici Scribe i

watch the Pitt-Fordham game a
year ago. Twenty thousand sat
through two hours of driving rain
to watch Carnegie Tech fall before
Notre, Dame this year. So, you ask
“why?” Why will people watch a
game under such impossible con-

ditions? What has football got
that the other sports -lack?

We too asked “why?” ,only we
asked it of a number of the spec-
tators at the Pitt games this _,year.
Our method of attack was direct
and simple, although ‘the effect was
comparable to that of the rattle-
snake who first paralyzes his vic-
tim. People are, it seems, amazed,
not to say stunned, when their mo-
tives in doing anything are ques-

tioned. “Why, we would ask, did,

you come to this game?”

The ﬁrst person we queried, a.

neat little blond, gave only arath-.
er prosaic_ response. She was there‘,
she simpered, because her boy
friend had taken her.

A certain gentleman who‘ was

considerably more illuminated than
his answer was illuminating, con-
ﬁded that he came to all the foot-
ball games because he liked the
“good fellowship” that was evi-
dent there, adding that he always
had a good time and liked to mix
With the crowd. .

The women,-and they're an aw-
ful lot of them, we asked, ‘agreed
that it was the all around color, the
band, and the old college spirit
that brought them out in any kind
of weather to watch a game.

A spectator who was more in-
clined to be communicative stated
that he liked football because you

  on The I-M

Schedule . . ..

 

could never tell just what was go-
ing to happen, and then proceeded
to_oﬂ"er examples. As this inter-
view took place at the Fordham
game the ‘ gentleman deﬁnitely
made his point.

P‘ Some of the other answers were
even "less informative. One woman
stated that she always went to see
one game a year. A telegraph op-
erator explained that he was there
only because it was his job, and if

_he never had to watch another 1
football game he’d be very happy. -

Another man merely said’ that he
liked to watch football, but it
turned out that he had even a bet-
ter reason. He was Mrs. Bowser's
father!

The poll proved two things: (1)“‘

people like to goto football games

-too, (2) people don’t know why
they go and don’t care just so they
get there.

Come to think of it, why did we
sit through that 1940 Fordham
game and through all six of the
1941 games? Oh, er, a, um. Oh
well, it's a silly" question anyway.

Pitt’s contribution to national

_ defense through technical training

at the main campus and at the ex-
tension branches is growing rapid-
ly,’ according to Joseph S. Lambie,
director of the University program.
Chief objective of the program
has been to remedy the deﬁcien-
cies of trained men in defense in-
dustry, and the course, originally
strictly an engineering course, has
been modiﬁed to meet the actual
demands of‘ industry it now in-
cludes physics, chemistry, and al-
lied sciences.
Courses today number 52 and

none of them are regular Unive.r- .

sity courses, but were evolved from
the suggestions of plant managers.
Fifteen or 20 additional courses are

 ow . Lambi e Reports Developments
In University Defense Program

being considered.

Classes vary in size with the de-
mand and facilities available. The
smallest course numbers 11 while
the largest has close to 700 students
enrolled. .

Although not the most import-
ant, gmechanical drawing is the
most popular, Mr. Lambie said. In-
{eluded in the curriculum are classes
111 Spectrography, analysis of met-
al, radio and electronics, and other
advanced courses. Unfortunately,
these are the courses which have
limited facilities.

Present ﬁgures show enrollment
of about 2,816 students ‘in the va-
rious courses, 1,614 on the camp-
us, and the others at the East Pitts-
burgh, Johnstown, and Erie exten-
sion centers. »

Most of the students are indus-
trial workers, about ﬁve per cent
being unemployed, and about three
per cent or 50, are women.

Since most of the students work,
classes are conducted in the even-
ings, except Saturday morning and
afternoon classes for those who
Work at night. Practically all the
classes meet twice a week in ses-
sions of three or four hours. The
entire course covers 16 weeks.

Many of the
members of theiliniversity faculty,
although a large number of promi-
nent industrial engineers, special-
ists in their ﬁelds, ‘have, been
brought in from the factories to
give men the speciﬁc training
needed.

Looking into the future, Mr.

Lambie declared that the courses 1

will continue after the war inor-
der to supply trained personnel
which will be needed in post-war
rehabilitation. ,
Mr. Lambie predicts. a‘ larger in-
flux of women into industry, not.
as office workers, but in the plants
in positions such as
which require skill but not great
physical strength. Taking into vac-
count the low average student age
of 28 years and the dropping of

dustry, he expects a youthful, pro-
gressive democratic spirit in the
industry of the future.
