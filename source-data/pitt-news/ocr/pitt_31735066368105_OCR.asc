  Election Violations ‘Getting Out of Hand’

0

By RAY WUSLICH

Student Government Board can-
didates who are illegally placing
campaign posters all over campus
will be prosecuted and the election
results could be suspended because
of the violations, the SGB Elec-
tions Committee announced at a
special meeting Wednesday.

Elections chairman Mavina
Simon told the candidates and
their representatives that they had
until Friday morning to remove
illegally placed materials. After
that deadline, any further written

complaints will be referred to the
Judicial Board. ‘

“Everything has gotten out of
hand,” Simon said. “The adminis-
tration is upset, mainly about pos-
ters. One candidate had adhesive
backed stickers in the Cathedral.
The maintenance people couldn’t
get it off, and that’s defacing
property.”

According to election regula-
tions, candidates are allowed a
maximum of fifteen posters, which
must be stamped by the Office of
Residence Life. Candidates are not
allowed. to place more than one
poster per classroom, and these
posters may not be placed on class-
room walls, windows, ceilings,

doors, or podiums, according to
regulations.

In addition, posters are only per-
mitted on the cork strip or on top of
the blackboard or on bulletin
boards.

At Wednesday’s meeting, Simon
said there have been numerous vio-
lations of the regulations and that
complaints have been registered by
Pitt professors and others who have
been inconvenienced by the place-
ment of posters on classroom walls.
(Not one poster in Towers Lobby
has ORL approval.)

president—wil1 not prevent the

I Today's generation is too
mannerly, and the only way to
overcome this problem is to act
up more and remember to l)e
cute about it, according to P. J.
O'Rourke, former editor of the
satire magazine National
y.’.,mnp0on.

The lecture, entitled “Mod-
ern Manners,” was sponsored
by the Pitt Program Council.

He said that students today
are just too good—compared to
the students he went to college
with.

“‘I went to college in the 605,”
O’Rourke said, “and we busted
our asses carrying heavy picket
signs and doing dangerous
drugs all so that you students
could have girls in your dorm
after 10 pm.”

He said"that we have to mis-
behave in a general‘ manner

rather than a specific one
because specific misbehavior
gets a person into specific

trouble—-like jail.

“The best way to act up in a
general way is to act weird," he
‘explained. “My generation
used up all the weird—if some-
thing was weird, we smoked it.

Bragging that his genera-
tion's act was a tough act to’ fol-
low, he offered the audience
some helpful hints on acting up
since it was obvious they were
not sure how.

“First,” he said, ”shock your
parents.” According to
O’Roiirke, this is actually good
for them—it readies them for
what is to come. He added that
one method is to dress in panty-
hose, dye your hair blue and

wear Band-aids on your
nipples.
()’Rourke resigned from

.\’aliom1I I.ampoon in I98],
and since then, he has been oti
the leiture circuit. He is cur-
rently working on several

movies, including one about

How To Act Right In The sos;
P.J. O’Rourke On Manners

Former National Lampoon editor P. J._0’Rourke advised
Pitt students last night on the importance of modern
manners. A sample: “Meals are a great place to make a
spectacle of yourself. You can be rude and get a lot of

attention.” H
destructive middle class kids.
He has also written a book on
modern manners.

Manners, according to
O'Rourke, are what your
mother always wanted to have.
However, in these times,
manners apply to new
situations.

For example, there is a drug
etiquette.

Marijuana is impolite,

O‘Rourke explained, because it
is rude to steal fiye gallons of
marshmallow dessert topping
and keep it all to yourself, not to
mention consuming it in 20
minutes.

“Tlie only polite drug." he
said. "is cocaine." Cocaine
turns you itito a charming,
bright, witty person." He added

Weinschenker photo
.that cocaine is very bad for the
body and urged people to give
their cocaine to him rather than
have them risk their health.

“What to wear when doing
cocaine is also very important,”
O'Rourke said, adding , that
Richard Pryor is an example of
how important this is.

Table manners are another
area entirely.

“Meals are a great place to
make a spectacle of yourself,”
O'Rourke explained. “You can
be rude and get a lot of
attention."

For instance, if people are
eating roast beef. you can run
around the table taking food off
of people’s plates and try to put

elections committee from enforc-
ing the regulations, Simon said.

“Candidates are trying to take
advantage of the idea that we won't
prosecute because of the numbers,”
she said. “The elections have been
thrown out before, and we will do
it again.” Candidates who are dis-
qualified may appeal, and the pro-
cess could suspend the results
indefinitely, she said.

Campaign violations have not
been limited to the placement of
posters.

“There has been evidence that
students have been tampering with

the campaign material of others,-”
Simon said.

Joyce Giancarlo, an assistant
director of student activities who
advises the SGB, said the adminis-
tration is considering charging
candidates who violate the code for
maintenance costs. In some cases,
she said, removaliof the material
damages university property. In
addition, the registrar is “talking
about going after them, which
means that their registrations at the
university could be disqualified.”

Thomas Campell, advisor to the
judicial board, said that violators
could face ajudicial board hearing.

Caribbean Conference

Studies Region’s Stability

By SCOTT REX

Pitt’s international conference
on stability and instability in the
Caribbean basin opened yesterday,
with a number of scholars assess-
ing the current situation in that
region and analyzing its future
options.

The conference, which also runs
today, deal/t with the “explosive
countries in the Caribbean Basin,”
including Nicaragua, El Salvador

and Guatemala, and the role of the
US. in the basin. _

The United States doesn’t under-
stand Latin America well and
doesn't consider relations with it to
be a priority, according to Howard
Wiarda, a political science profes-
sor at the American Enterprise
Institute.

Board MembersArgue How To Act Right In The 803

“T

g By TODD ERKEL

The Student Government Board
yesterday failed to reach an agree-
ment on Pitt's representation at the
Association for American Univer-
sity Students Conference in Prin-
ceton, N.].

O, A proposal by the Allocations

{Committee that would allow five
representatives from various Pitt
student organizations, including
two from SGB to attend the confer-
ence was rejected by a vote of 6-1.

Chip Roth cast the lone “no"
vote_, and Spencer Davis was absent
from the meeting.

The SGB had originally pro-
posed that l0 students, including
five from SGB, attend the
November conference at which
schools from across the nation will
conduct workshops for various st.u—
dent organizations. One of the
workshops will be presented by
Pitt's Black Action Society.

“The Allocations Committee
did right in cutting five people,”
said Chip Roth. “There are guide-
lines for other student organiza-
tions. Why double or triple the
number for student government?”

Other board members disagreed
with Roth, saying that although
funded by student government, the
conference is a benefit to all student
organizations and should be ade-
quately represented by students
from Pitt.

“Money is irrelevent if the pro-
gram is worth it,” said board
member Linda O’Connor, who

Q'%[[€Hd(‘d last year's conference.

Both the board and the Alloca-
tions Committee will now recon-
sider the problem.

‘About Conference

The board later voted unani-
mously to recognize the Pitt chap-
ter of the Youth Institute for Peace
in the Middle-East, a national.
non-sectarian organization of
Christians and Jews formed to pro-
mote dialogue and cooperation
with Arab organizations in dealing
with the problems in the MidF.ast.

In other business: '

0 Linda O'Connor has been
named to the Provost Search Com-
mittee now seeking a replacement
for Rhoten Smith. Linda said that
she will contact the schools of pros-
pective candidates to see how they
worked with student organ

0 Linda Hausman announced
that the budget for the new Com-
muter Association will be ready by
Nov. l0. Hausman also announced
that she would contact the city
about the parking spaces taken
over by the filming crew of Para-
mount Pictures in front of Carne-
gie Library.

0 A request by the Pitt Bowling
Club for $450 to conduct an
instructional program for its
members was approved.

0 A request by the Resident Stu-
dent Association to move its Nov.
18 coffee house to Soldiers 8: Sailors
was approved.

0 A decision on funding for the
Pitt Hockey Club was delayed until
next week.

0 A $35 request by the Pitt Fris-
bee Club .for tournament registra-
tion fees was denied. President
Todd Deluca said that funding for
any inter-collegiate competition
would require the SGB to have
insurance covering the players, a
financial impossibility.

continued from page one
the (ow back together again,
O'Rourke said.

He said that one of his favor-
ites is using roast chicken for
hand puppets and pretending
that they can fly. He explained
that this was his preference over
food fights because the ideas are
so much more clever.

O'Rourke also said that
manners tell you how to ingest
food properly, but never how to
expel it.

“There’s no way to do this
politely," he added. “just do it
interestingly so that it makes for
amusing stories later on.”

O’Rourke also said that the
least a person can do is to make
certain that what he throws up
matches what his date is wear-
ing. For example, if you are dat-

ing a preppie who is into pink
and green, then the proper
foods are lima beans and rose.
Navy blue skirt and blazer out-
fits are difficult. he admitted,
because there are very few blue
foods.

.\lanners regarding dating
and sex, are also changing,
according to O’Rourke.

He said that this’generation
can still act weird as far as sex is
concerned because weird sex is
something his generation did
not use up. His generation
wanted to use it all up, but Jim
Morrison died before he got
around to them.

Since women's liberation,
dating etiquette has become
more equal.

“On a (late. the man cannot
cut Lg) his date’s food or tie her

shoes for her. but he performs
many other services for her.”
O‘Rourke said.

He told the ' males in the
audience not to be fooled into
thinking that the ERA was a
failure. He explained that the
females really did win and that
now is the time for all males to
unconditionally surrender.

He said that men have three
duties: to be husbands, provide
orgasms and get in touch with
their emotions, which means
crying in public on demand.

“You have to be husbands
because women want them for
sortie reason—]ane Fonda has
one." he said. He added that the
training for this is to never put
the garbage out and to ask every
woman you meet when dinner
will be ready.

Forum: Athletic Scholarships

continued from page three

have to do well in school, so you
can play, so you can keep your
scholarship."

He said that it is harder to lose a
scholarship than to keep doing
well academically while under
contract.

“This is a helluva program," he
said. “There are support services
who say you got to do this, see
him or‘ see a tutor. They really
keep an eye on you and catch you
before you start doing badly."

Although it occurs quite rarely,
an athlete can lose a scholarship
by being convicted of a crime,
subject to J-Board action, guilty
of not following academic guide-
lines, or found using drugs._

These are among the “generic
rules" in Bozik's administration

which says it adheres to _demo-.

cratic guidelines when dealing
with scholarship violators.
According to Bozik, an appeals

process is established when he
notiﬁes, by May, the allegedly
guilty athlete and says the monies
will not be renewed the following
academic year.

"The student then appeals to
the vice-provost," Bozik
explained, "who convenes a

group who hears the athletes-

case. There have been three
cases in the last couple years, so
the system does work"

There are always the shadier
sides of athletic scholarships, par-
ticulary ruthless recruiters who

- may cast bad lights on recipients.

Vaughan described his situa-
tion best.

“I don't believe in those kinds
of recruiters. If they can buy you,
then they can always sell you. If
they give you cars and money,
they feel like you owe them some-
thing. Hobody's going to sell
me.”

Dukovich sees the “promise-

all" recruiter as casting a false
impression on -highly talented
athletes.

“They give you the spoiled
effect and make it seem that peo-
ple give you everything," he said.

"I was once getting taped near
a volleyball player, and one of the
trainers went out to get coffee. He
asked me ifl wanted a cup, andl

. said ‘yes.’ When he brought it

back for me, she really cut into
me after that."

Whatever the obligations, con-
sequences or details involved in
athletic scholarships, Bozik is
looking to increase the primary
sources of scholarship monies-
from both university funds and
booster contributions.

“One of my objectives as
athletic director is to raise the
level supplied by the Pitt Golden
Panthers. I want to establish an
endowment fund in perpetuity
that collects interest.”

rarchy that take precedence, such as
our relations with the Soviets,"
Wiarda said. “We do not under-
stand it well...it is not viewed in its
own terms, but all of us see what we
want to see.”

According to Wiarda, 11.5. pol-
icy toward Latin America has
remained basically unchanged
through the past administrations.
The question in dealing with
Latin America is not the adminis-
tration's goals, but the best way to
achieve them, he said.

“In non—crisis times, we promote
democracy and human rights, but
these are subordinate to our inter-
est in maintaining stability and
our access to raw materials and
markets," Wiarda said. “We don't
mind change as long as it doesn’t
get out of hand.”

He said the press has helped
moderate the administration’s
view because “no administration
can justify the slaughter of nuns in
the face of media attention."

Pitt professor James Malloy said
that a structural change in the
1970s caused us to re-examine our
policies toward Central America.

“We can no longer call the
shots,” Malloy said. “And there is
no other power to do it, either.”

Malloy advocated forming an
international coalition, at the initi-
ative of the U.S., to deal with Latin
America.

NICARAGUA

The United States’ policy toward
Nicaragua “proves to be counter-

productive,” said Harold Sims, a
Pitt history professor.

The Reagan administration sup-
ports opposition groups, Sims
explained, and is “unaware" of the
goals of the Sandinistas.

Sims said the Sandinistas have
four goals: a mixed economy: pol-
itical pluralism; a literacy and
health campaign; and a diversifi-
cation of military and economic
aid.

A destabilization campaign
begun last year by the Central
Intelligence Agency has diverted
the Sandinistas toward these goals,
Sims said. He doubted. however,
that the U.S. will become involved
militarily in the area.

“You can slip close to 100 advis-
ers past the American public, but
you can't slip military interven-
tion,” he said.

Professor Mauricio Solaun from
the University of Illinois said the
U.S. appears to be moving toward
the option of negotiations with the
Sandinistas since Secretary of State

George Schultz replaced Alexander 1

Haig.

EL SALVADOR

A solution to the crisis in El Sal-
vador is not a realistic possibility in
the near future, according to Mar-
garet Daly Hayes, of the U.S.
Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations.

Hayes, who rules out stability as
a possible solution, gave five possi-
ble outcomes to the conflict in El

Salvador: military victory by the
left; a political solution; consolida-
tion of the centrist position;
entrenchment and the prevailing
of the status quo; and a military
victory by the right.

“Not one of these is likely in the
future. People in El Salvador have
to tolerate both sides, and they have
opted for neither," Hayes said.

GUATEMALA

The United States “is stuck with
the burden of history" for its inter-
vention in Central America, said
Richard Millet, a sociology profes-
sor from Southern Illinois
University.

“There are people in our govern-
ment who would pay the Nicara-
guans to drive their tanks into El
Salvador," Millet said. “That's
what they seem to want."

He explained that the Central
American crisis is increasingly sig-
nificant because “it has raised the
killings of innocent people to a
world level."

Millet said that a military victory
by the right is a possible outcome
to the conflict. “It (the military
right) has seen what happens to
armies that lose—-in Nicaragua,
Cuba and in the Mexican
revolution.” »

He said one alternative to cur-
rent U.S. policy is for the United
States to “do a Pontious Pilate Act
and wash our hands of the whole
affair."

Q?

By MARK A. SINDLER

With college expenses continu-
ally skyrocketing, the prospects
of high school graduates from
low-income families receiving
any higher education is becom-
ing rarer—unless that graduate is
gifted with exceptional athletic
talents.

To three Pitt varsity athletes,
these statements are applicable.
if it were not for their natural abili-
ties, a college education might
have been but a passing fantasy.

Clyde Vaughan, a 6-7 junior for-
ward on the basketball team, is
one of seven children from a
ﬁnancially-strapped family. For
senior Diane Zack, a full.scholar-
ship on the women's volleyball
team was her only savior as she
came from a household whose

(‘parents couldn't afford college

expenses." ,

And Rick Dukovich, a special
teams and defensive secondary
football player, views his scholar-
ship as the inroad to a career in
dentistry.

"I accepted (the scholarship)
because it’s a means to an end. it
would have been harder on my
family (there are two other
siblings now in college) to get me
through dentistry. Besides, athlet-
ics is a good way to get school
paid for," Dukovich said.

At Pitt, athletic scholarships are
a big business, although the
entire program pales when com-
pared to other Division I schools,
according to athletic director Dr.
Ed Bozik

"Our ﬁnancial aid, in compari-
son, is relatively modest with
respect to state funds or booster
contributions," Bozik said.

Even so, the Golden Panther
Club raised an excess of
$858,000 for fiscal year 1981 -82,
a new school record. Pitt cur-
rently sustains 231 partial and full
scholarship recipients.

The sport-by-sport breakdown
of these scholarships reveals 101
football scholarships, 16 for
men's basketball, 15 for baseball,
12 for soccer, 22 for men's and
women's swimming, 15 for
men’s and women's gymnastics,
13 for men's and women's track
and ﬁeld, 12 for women's basket-
ball, 10 for women's volleyball,

" one each for ﬁeld hockey and

women's tennis and 13 for
wrestling.

Bozik noted that the NCAA
stipulates that only. 95 and _15
scholarships can be awarded to
football and men's basketball,
respectively. The two Pittteams,
however, exceed these figures
because of injuries. Pitt can there-
fore add players if injuries reduce
the number of scholarship play-
ers to below the prescribed
ceilings.

Pitt's athletic department gives
all coachina staffs, except foot-
balls and men's basketball's,
budgets for recruiting because
the two latter teams are revenue-
producing sports.

Football and basketball scho-
larships are all full scholarships,
meaning the athlete receives full
tuition, room and board free of
charge. Another NCAA bylaw
also states that all scholarships
(full or partial) must be ‘granted
on a year-to-year basis. Bozik
said, however, that Pitt tends to
make the four-year commitment
to all recipients, injuries

. ‘ notwithstanding.

When determining monies for
recruits, Bozik said, "It is the
recommendation of the coach
who makes budgetary decisions.
He or she starts out with a_budget-
ary limit?‘ .

With that in mind, all head

' coaches make a collective deci-

sion, Bozik stated, and determine
on which sports to concentrate.

Also taken into consideration
are the faciligzies available to each
sport and the individual
programs.

FORUM

Athletic Scholarships

Once various teams determine
where they stand, partial and full
scholarships are doled out in
many ways, Bozik explained.
Examples include half tuition or
full tuition and no room and
board. Pell Grants and PHEAA
assistance are also considered
ﬁnancial alternatives in each ath-
lete's case.

"Say the track coach has a
youngster he wants to recruit,"
Bozik explained. "He knows the
family's ﬁnancial background
and then sees the ﬁnancial aid
officer. He will then see me, and
we will work towards a solution
using state funds and university
subsidies." ,

Bozik added that each recip-
ient is handled on an individual
basis. it is the vice-provost who
make: the ﬁnal aid award, but it is
Bozik who deals directly with the
teams.

Although scholarship recip-
ients may incur no negative as-
pects from being subsidized,
-‘.-here are many obligations
placed on them, including a min-

.jmum QPA (2.0), training ses-

sions, coaching disciplines and
conﬂicts with academic work.

Dukovich was recruited by
then-defensive coordinator Foge
"azio because he "kinda knew I
was coming here." The Bethel
Park native liked the hometown
atmosphere at Pitt and was inter-
ested in the graduate work
offered.

He said of his scholarship, "it
takes a great burden off your
back, and I like playing football.
Everything keeps going, keeps
going. The schedule keeps you
from getting lax, and I can get that
way if I'm not busy."

lndeed, considering Dukovich
is now nursing an ailing knee. His
typical daily schedule means
being at Pitt Stadium by 230 p.m.
and attending meetings for about
an hour. After getting taped, prac-
tice starts at 3:30 and ends at 6

p.m. “
Added to that is the unwritten

- requirement" that he lift three

times a week and spend his leis-
ure time watching game ﬁlms. In
addition, he gets knee treatments
three times a day, starting at 7:30
a.m.

The regiment is not quite as
rigorous for Zack, but she takes it
seriously.

"it means that l have enough
skill and talent that l'm important
enough for the team. They
believe in me. I'm a good invest-
ment," she said.

Zack practices daily from 3:30-
6:30 p.m., but taping and treat-
ments eat up another hour. She
cites another obligation, the
"mental things every player goes
through."

"What I have to do is perform.
To do this it takes hours of mental
preparation during free time. I
can't even study during trips. I
know what I have to dO—that's
the reason," Zack explained.

Of the 100 or so schools that
sought Vaughan's talents during
his high school days, he chose
Pitt because of its business
school and the fact that the
coaches here make the players
go to class and emphasize
graduation.

Sunday through Friday,
Vaughan can be found at the ﬁeld
house from 3 to 7 p.m. Again,
tapings and practice are
preoccupations.

The trend with these and other
scholarship recipients is that
academia interferes on a regular

basis. During his season,

Vaughan can easily miss two or

three days of classes per week
»"It really hurts,“-» he said. "Peo-

' ple think otherwise. But I usually

find a girl with notes and can usu-
ally take exams before road trips.
The professors know, and I tell
them ahead of time."

For Zack, the story is different.

"it's like pulling teeth with the
professors when I leave," she
said. “Making up tests is harder
and some professors do not like
athletes because of the football
players. They don't like giving
special treatment”

Zack had to accept a "G" grade
during Nationals last year. She
said she always makes a point to
view her calendar in advance and

looks to her professor for mutual ‘C

agreement over exam schedul-
In .

gShe likes completing exams
before road trips to avoid
makeups and, as she repeated, ‘'1
can't study during trips because
I'm thinking volleyball too much."

The obligations Dukovich con-
fronts are bypassed by "doing
what you're supposed to do. You

Deeper Issues

Pittsburgh’s referendum concerning defense
spending has had its teeth filed, but fortunately, it

Voters will decide on Tuesday if the mayor should
be required to prepare an annual report outlining
just how much of the city’s federal income tax dol-
lars are going to the Pentagon and the impact
defense spending has on the economy.

The wording of the referendum is bland, giving
the impression that the only pertinent question is
whether there should be a report. The issue, how-
ever, goes deeper than that.

The ballot question gives Pittsburgliers the
opportunity to show whether they care about exces-
sive military spending or the loss ofjobs experienced L

The question will read:

“Shall Section 204...be supplemented to require
the mayor to provide annual reports on the federal
tax money paid from the citizens of Pittsburgh to the
federal government for use by the military?”

The original statement, sponsored by the national
organization Jobs With Peace, required both a
report and an analysis of the impact of the military
budget on the city’s economy in relation to jobs and
social services. Jobs With Peace has sponsored reso-
” lutions in several major cities against higher mil-

The average Pittsburgh family will spend $22,000
over the next five years to fund the defense budget.
While spending for social services is being cut 50
percent, according to the group's local chapter.

Employment research has shown that industrial
centers lose more jobs than they gain. In 1983, Pitt.s-
burgh stands to show a net loss of $1.7 million, and ‘
.we’re not the only ones not getting our fair share.

More than as a focus on unemployment, peace
groups see it as away to increase voter awareness,
helping to inform the public of the effects of the‘
arms race in dollars and cents terms.

Issues In The SGB Race

By RON BARBER

I have previously suggested that
issues play a less than primary role
in student government elections.
While some relationship exists
between the positions favored by a
Student Government Board (SGB)
candidate and the way students
voted last year, the relationship is
rather weak. But this relationship
describes voter behavior only.
What about the candidates? What
role do issues play in their cam-
paign strategies? Here I can suggest
many more questions than I.can
answer. To what extent, for exam-
ple, do candidates map out their
stands before they start campaign-
ing? Do they maintain consistent
stands throughout the campaign?
To what extent are issues stressed
in their posters and advertise-
ments? A great deal of research
would have to be done to answer
these questions. Sotne interesting
information does exist, however,
regarding another question: Do
candidates organize themselves
into ideologically similar groups
to advance their common ideas like
professional politicians organize

’ parties, and if so, how?

Political parties have been
allowed in past elections under the
Student Government Code,
although they have also been out-
lawed at various times. In 1975, sev-
eral students sought to run as
“Young Socialists.” At that time,
parties (groups of students run-
ning under a common title) were
not allowed under the election
code, and early in the campaign,
the Student Government Elections
Committee (SGEC) told this group
that they could not distribute liter-
ature identifying themselves as
“YounggSocialists." Later in the
campaign, however, SGEC ruled
that this case had not been properly
handled and granted them the
right to idetitify themselves as a
political party.

The next year, many “Young
Socialists,” calling themselves
“Socialists," entered the SGB race
under a new electioti c()de permit-

‘ ting parties. In that year, due to

irregularities in the votitig
machines then iti use, the first bal-
loting for SGB president was itival-

" idated and a second presidential

electioti called.

()ccasionally, students have reg-
istered with SGEC as “slate.s."
under provisions in the election
cotle‘allowing slate cantlidates to
use common pulilicity materials
antl spend tnore money on thecam-
paign than intliyitlual tatitlitlates.
The (‘lll’I’t’lII election totle pet tnits a
slate of two (‘;tII(ll(l;Ilt'\ to spentl

not have a generic title (such as
“l)etnocrats” or “Young Social-
ists,” for instance) and often gives
less emphasis to the conitnonality
of the views of its members than a
party would.

Slates and parties are not seen
too freqtieiitly in SGB elections.

“The control of SGB
elections by funding
interests may...prevent
students from speaking
with a clear, united

‘ voice.”

To my knowledge, there has not
been more than one slate or party
involved in any one election since
1970, when the Student Commun-
ity Union and the United Student
Coalition squared off in a cam-
paign that resulted in two invali-
dated elections and a president
assuming office amid allegations
that he had spent several hundred
dollars in excess of the amount
allowed under the election code.
Certainly we cati say that politi-
cal parties have not played a signif-
icant role in recent SGB
campaigns. And I would again
suggest that issues of catnpus—wide
interest have not played a leading
role, either. Perhaps we must con-
cltitle that the primary interest stu-

dents today have iti student
government has little to do with
these sorts of issues. Perhaps it is
better this way. Campaigns have
run more smoothly when parties
and the issue orientations they
bring are not involved. After all
student governments might not
have power to bring about the
changes that some optimistic can-
didates and observers suggest. Per-
haps the contemporary world does
not raise the desire in students to be
clearly heard on social issues.

The important job of SGB may
be to divide the spoils from the Stu-
dent Activities Fee among student
organizations. If that is the case,
then why not allow those interested
organizations to do battle over SGB
elections and allow the rest of us to
live in peace?

The problem with this attitude is
that it threatens to allow the alloca-
tions interests of student organiza-
tions to control student
government to such an extent that
broader issues cannot receive fair
hearing. The control of SGB elec-

tions by funding interests may, for_ _

Q-

example, prevent students frotn -I

speaking with a clear, united voice
against undesirable actions by uni-
versity or government adrninistra—
tors. Students must consider this
problem (and similar problems
which may exist) before allowing
their representative institutions to
become nothing more than money-
machines for student organiza-
tiotis.

Now that the University of Pitts-
burgh's Center for Latin American
Studies has organized a “major"
conference on the subject, it seems
appropriate to discuss the program
of economic aid to the Caribbean
Region as proposed by the Reagan
Administration.

The “Caribbean Basin" was
“created" by President Reagan
during his speech at the Organiza-
tion of American States (OAS) on
Feb. 24, 1982. Such a region was
defined as the Islands, Central
America and South American
_nations that have Carribbean
coastlines.

Graduate students of the almost
defunct geography department at
Pitt placed an emergency call to the
State Department to respectfully
point out that El Salvador doesn’t
have any coastlines in the Carri-
bean. “So? What the heck!” ans-
wered the other end of the line.

The Caribbeanlis not a region of
economic interest to the United
States businessmen. but, in view of
our military presence in El Salva-
dor and Honduras, this region has
recently achieved a political and
military priority to our
government.

The Caribbean Basin Initiative

'(CBl) is basically a one-year pack-

age of U.S. aid. However, the
Caribbean Basin Initiative as
explained by President Reagan is
an effort to stop “imported terror-

ism and armed attack" in the
region. The CBI becomes another

military project camouflaged by
the benevolent idea of U.S. eco-
nomic aid, thus abusing the good
will of the American people.

Such a point of view is one of the
fundamental faults of the CBI. The

U.S.. government again fails to rec-
ognize that the social and political

instability of the region has its
roots in centuries of unsatisfied

basic human needs, instead of
“outside terrorism and subver-

sion.” In essence, the CBI becomes
a modern version of U.S. imperial

theological doctrines for Latin

America.

The economic assistance under
the CBI means 15350 'n economic
support funds.

The CBI doesn't takeinto con-
sideratibn the particular socio-
economic needs of each country,
nor does it allow for self-help pro-
jects initiated by the countries in
question. The centralized plan-

_ ning and implementation of the

program lie on the desks of
Washington bureaucrats.

The CBI is not a unilateral,’
multi-year commitment to help the'
poor of the Caribbean, who COITI1
-prise 80 percent of the total popula-K
tion. Instead, it promotes”
unbalanced growth beneficial to‘
the rich while its incentives for
agricultural production of export’
crops will accelerate the malnutri-
tion of the local people. Wide-
spread hiinger is already present.

The CBI funds are insufficient,
ill-distributed and misused for mil-
itary purposes. Other factors, such
as the ecoinoiiics of Mexico and
Venezuela, U.S. aggression against
Cuba, Grenada and Nicaragua,
U.S. presence in El Salvador and
support for its U.S.-elected govern-
ment, and huge military aid to
Honduras and Guatemala have

created an atmosphere of total dis-
trust for our initiative.

Poor economic plannng of the
CBI can be described better by these
examples: the CBI offers incentives
to increase sugar production and
dependence on the U.S.\as a single
trading partner, in spite of the fact
that, by 1998. the U.S. will produce
enough sugar from corn syrup to
cover all domestic needs and
become a cheaper international
source. Why should the U.S. plan
to invest one-third of the CBI‘s
funds in El Salvador, considering
the present situation, rather than
try to find a solution to that con-
flict before any .U.S. aid is availa-

R" ble? But the solution in El Salvador

is not a military one—unless we in

G The Main Reason For Economic Aid To Caribbean

the United States desire another
Vietnam type of defeat. The only
solution is negotiations between
the FDR and El Salvador’s arm"
without any U.S. interference.

Unfortunately, the CBI's main
purpose seems to be to maintain a
U.S.-Soviet polarized world
polemic initiated by the Center of
Strategic and International Studies
at Geo'getown University. Such a
frame of discussion is the identical
structure of the “major" confer-
ence organized by a similar institu-
tion at Pitt.

What’s Vital: Rock and Roll

Dear Editor:

I'd like to congratulate the intel-
lectual community of Pitt. Recent
editions of The Pitt News have
been filled with student letters.
This should counteract any argu-
ments that Pitt students are apa-
thetic and uncaring.

For The Pitt News editors, it was
just a matter of finding ar issue of
significant magnitude to arrest the
attention of dedicated students.

After all the editorials that have
been addressed to pressing issues-
issues we should be conscious of
now, issues we’ll confront for the
rest of our lives—we have finally
seen an issue that stirs the souls of

students. No, Pitt students aren’t V

concerned about Political Action
Committees, nuclear arms or the
environment. Even when editorials

hit close to home—grade restric-
tions on financial aid, the lack of
jobs for college’ grads——no one
responded. What did engender a
massive response was Chris Clin-
ton’s commentary on sexism in
rock lyrics.

Isuppose I could find it encou-
raging that the issue of sexism has
sparked controversy here. But, after
all, none of these letters had a thing
to do with sexism. The problem
was that Ms. Clinton didn’t know
the lyrics to The Who’s latest song.
I mean, where is your social
consciousness?

What is real, vital, important, is
due respect for the lyrics of rock
groups. Our entertainment has
become more real than reality. If
we ignore the larger issues of
society maybe they’ll go away. And

in the meantime, we can have a hell
of a good time.

We find it necessary to party, to
amuse ourselves, but not to live as

We don’t have convictions, we

infuriating that college students-.

When you get paid back with interest like

COOL CATS/25 YEARS OF
ROCK-N-ROLL STYLE
Edited by Tony Stewart
Delilah Books

Rock-n-roll has only been
around for what, 25 or 30
years? But if it were all to end
tomorrow, it would probably
stand as the most, although cer-
tainly not the best, documented
art form/movement/craze since
the start of written history. So,
you ask, do we need or want
another book to further rock's
posterity? Maybe not, but, Cool
Cuts isn't just another look at
rock history.

Tony Stewart, feature editor

of England's New Musical Express
magazine, has put together a
book that shines new light on
rock's development by examin-
ing its style—the clothes, hair,
glares and poses that ushered in
the youth rebellion of the
1950s—~and continuing ‘the
study of how that style reflects
the rebellion's music upto the
present day.
_ Stewart has the help here of
such luminaries as Ian Dury and
Paul Weller of The ]am, who
write on the '50s and '60s
respectively. The three other
chapters, "Girls,tyle,” ”Glam—
rock" and "The Seventies,” are
all handled by writers from
NME,

With the exception of Dury,
who gives us a running‘ mono-

logue that is just too‘personal

and too British for any Yankee
youth to grasp, the writers all
manage to summarize eras of
rock—n-roll with plenty of infor-
mation, while still leaving time
to soak up the great photos (all
in b & w though) found in each
chapter.

 

 

Paul Weller reveals as much
about the forces behind his
music-making as hedoes on the
Mod movement in his '60s’
chapter entitled ”The Total
Look." The book's highlight,
though, has to be Cynthia
Rose's chapter, "Cirlstyle."
Rose tackles issues beyond

 

Roxy Music and its "art-
directed existence" forms the
focus of the chapter on Glam-
rock as the book takes on a very
British angle .

Ultimately, Cool Cats is a pic-
ture book, and maybe that's
where the real story isjtold. The
shifts that took popular music

  

fashion and music, providig
insight into the roles women
play in rock—n-roll, the market-
ing of image in rock and the
interconnections between pop-
ular music and the media.
Rose contrasts the "50's teen
idolette" with the denunciation
of that tradition, the "Cheap
Girls"——The Shangri-Las, The
Ronettes and The lkettes. Rose
sees contemporaries such as
Bette Midler, Patti Smith and
even Bruce Springsteen as "the
echoes of the Cheap Girl sin-
gers.” Rose goes on to give
attention to trend setters such
as Janis Joplin and Debbie
Harry.

, Go!

back and forth across the Atlan-
tic are revealed here through
pictures of English and Ameri-
can youth borrowing each oth-.
er’s ”styles." The timelessness
of the ”style" is also exhibited in
pictures of artists from differ-
ent eras in similar dress and
pose. Such juxtapositions
include shots of The Clash in
1980 and The Shadows of 1960
and one of_ the Beatles on EMI's
balcony set next to a parody by
the Sex Pistols of the now fam-
ous album cover.

Cool Cuts is a must for anyone

interested in taking a whole
new look at rock—n-roll, as well
as those who think that England
is the lifeblood of popular music
as it so blatantly considers itself
to be. An American writer or
even the lure of glossy color pic-
tures could have made it a book
for everyone to have, but con-
sidering how we whooped them
in the Revolution, we'll allow
them to go on thinking what
they may. But remember one
thing: the King was born here.

'Hold Me!’--Squeeze Me.
——Tdke Mel-lame!

By IIM HOHMAN

Pitt's Studio Theatre kicked
off its 1982 season with an out-
standing production of Jules
Feiffer's Hold Me! The combina-
tion of sketches that never cease
to hold your attention and per-
formances that bring each char-
acterto life will surely make this
one of the better plays of the
year.

Hold Me! is, in short, a com-
ment on the situation of the
individual in the society of the
'80s. Through a collage of var-
ious scenes, each with different
characters, held together only
by the personage of the dancer
(Cece Donoghue), Hold Me!
touches on many of the prob-
lems of today—breakup of mar-
riages, emotional repression,
violence and the plight of the
elderly are only a few examples.

It is to the credit of the direc-
tor, Christopher Applegate, and
the cast that Hold Me! is truly
entertaining. What could have
been a morose, depressing play
or an idiotic, stupid one turns
out instead to be funny, yet
thought-provoking. The entire
cast of six was simply excellent.
As Bernard, William B. Cooley,
]r., had the entire audience
chuckling as he related the
tragedy of a man who was too
nice for his own good or the
story of two lovers who
”exploded like two bombs in the
night." De Bora Smith moved
the whole audience as, in a
prayer to God, she relates the
anguish of a woman who has
finally found something good in
life, only to find herself losing it.
With perfect timing, she deli-
vered the unexpected punch
line. Among the many charac-

ters Eileen Kramer played, her
portrayal of the woman who
puts her face together with Fix-
ident stood out as one of the
best.

Especially good were Cece
Donoghue, Barbara Ann
Mischler and Dan Wyse. As the
dancer, Cece Donoghue per-
formed her dances with great
wit and irony, yet when called
upon to relate the feelings of
disillusioned youth, she is
totally believable. Barbara Ann
Mischler was haunting as the
woman to whom ”waking up is a
false act of courage." As the
brainy woman who tricks men
into thinking they are smarter
than she is, Mischler plays her
scene with just the right touch
of humor. Dan Wyse plays all
his characters, from a simpleton
in the laundry room to a lonely
outcast to a man who tap dances
through life, with humanity and
skill.

Christopher Applegate's
direction left the audience no
time to think; each episode
started immediately after the
preceding one. This rapid pacing
enhanced the collage effect of
the play quite nicely.

The set, sound, lighting, cos-
tumes and choreography, done
by Henry Hehmann, Gary Con-

lklin, David Jager-Walker,

Cheryl Bell and Cece Donoghue
respectively, were also well
done and appropriate for the
play- —
Many people avoid the
theater because they're never
sure whether or not they'll like
the production and don't want
.to waste money. With such a
-low price (free to Pitt under-
grads) and high quality, there is

no ‘reason why anybody should I

miss the Studio Theatre's pro.-
duction of Hold Me.’

  AT SELED THEATRE NEAR YOU!

Where has this tour taken you so far, and
where do you and the hand intend to go?

All over...we went up to Toronto and
then we went down the west coast of
America down to San Francisco, San
Diego, L.A., New Orleans, you name
it, we did it! (laughter) Cleveland, all
those places; we're just covering
some other places we haven't been to,
mainly major places, just trying to
get near to a few people who have
heard the records, like Generation X,
but also look into what I'm into now,
you know, so we're just trying to get
close to people.

Why did you leave Generation X?

Iust because I didn't think the group
was going to expand on its ideas any-
more just by staying in it, you know?
I thought there were more chances of
expanding on the ideas if we were
apart. It was easiest, it . was just
obvious...the last Generation X
album wasn't the beginning of some-
thing for that group; I think it was
the culmination of it, and then the
individual people are gonna have to

take different areas and different
places, you know?

 
   
   
 

Do you think you re had to take a lot oftlalt‘ for
moving to /i/rmuu from Eilglizllll?

 
   
   

Oh, yeah. For some people, it's really
taboo to do that, but then it's always
been wrong to do so many things.
Uh...I just think "fuck 'em," you
know, you can't please everybody all
the time, and I'm not out to do it. I
don't care, pleasing people isn't
really the object. What the object is
more is trying’ to tell the truth and
write good songs and observe things
in the way you wish them to, rather
than do things just 'cos it pleases peo-
ple. Well, ‘you know, nothing's
pleased anybody half the time, so
fuck ‘em (laughter); I mean, my parents
used to tell me I wasan idiot for
‘having long hair, but hey, I stuck it
out, and now I'm an idiot because I've
gone to America! You know, you
can't win! —

 
          

Do you think up liven worth it——moz‘ing to

 
 

/lmerim.-°

 
 
  

Yeah, because I came here to try and
do something new, or at least get a
band that could work on the road and
play to people again and have the
enthusiasm...it takes .a lot and I
needed to come to a new place just to
kinda force myself into getting the
enthusiasm back to bother to be in a
group, you know, 'cos when you've
been through all those sort of man-
ager trouble things and people rip-
ping you off and stuff, when they're
supposed to be your friend, there's a
lot of betrayal, right? So that was
another reason Generation X broke
up. It's more to get back where we
started, you know, where rock and
roll was fun; where we didn't have no
money, we didn't have nothing," we

rip us off. I wanted to work and be as

successful or more successful in
terms of experimenting than Gener-
ation X, and that's really where we're
§8HH3 IRBVS 83 t8 RSWE tHa‘t‘§ Wflﬂt
we've got—something going in
terms of musicians.

How would you classify your own music?

It's more rock and roll probably than
Generation X, though only really

because I took what I wanted out of ~'

the last album, out of the last bit of
Generation X, which was using the
rhythm machine, the idea of constant
rhythm and constant heartbeat
rhythm, which was what I was get-
ting into. The old Generation X used
to have a kind of inner rhythm, it just
kind of moved on its own rhythm. It
was a bit more like...I guess it was
like The Who and other people. The
beat wasn't rooted to a 4/4 time, you
know, I dunno, it's not all that {laugh-
ter); it's all really very simple, instead
of going oom—bam.’ oorn—l7am/, it just
went srhoo—s(hoo, srhoo—schoo/ It grooved
a lot. But this stuff is rooted to a
group, it's definite dance music, and
that's what we got into in Genera-
tion X, and that was mainly because
of me, I believe.

/lre you still looking for that dance musir
sound?

Yeah, that's really what I want to do;
I want to achieve both things. You
know, it's easy enough to say clever
things in songs and it's easy enough
to get people to dance and to move
about and think together, but to do
them all at the same time is an ulti-
mate kind oflthing, so that's what I'm
trying to do. ‘

What are your reflections on /lmeriran

. Showcase, Friday October 29, 1982

---Page 15

 

Well, the only difference is the Eng-
lish audience is much more into the
fashion of things, so you tend to be
able to tell on whose side people are a
bit more immediately. Like people
‘kind of get into wearing your gear, so
if they're into you, they'll sort of
have stuff like you wear on, and if
they're not into you, they'll have
stuff like the other groups wear. So,
that's the only thing that's harder to
tell _(in the U.S.)——what people are
into. But people are a lot moreopen
in a way here ’cos they're not so con-
fined by a national press and national
fashion. You can wear jeans here and
be into "heavy metal, punk rock or
classical music—to a certain extent
there's that missing in England, but
it's still the same in terms of people
appreciating it as music, I think, so to
me they're people like anybody else. I
play to all different types of people-—
Iapanese people, black people, and it
just depends on if they're into it
personally.

/ire you'(ounting on this album to finally
make Billy lilol a superstar in /imerim?

No, it's only a beginning for the
whole thing; really, it's a beginning
for me again, just as the third Gener-
ation X’ album was a beginning for
that goup again and an end as well.
But it is a beginning for me and I
could take it lots of ways——I might
keep on like -this or I might do
records with somebody else or-—-I
dun_no——that's what's kind of excit-
ing about it.

Why iliil you release only an El’ last year
(Don't Stop)?

It was just me playing about, really-

'a record for fun. Also I wanted

"Dancing With Myself" to come out
here in a form that American people
could buy without paying rip-off
import prices, so it was a good way of
getting four tracks for a cheap price.

but, of course, it couldn't be right '

’cos I'm much more used to playing
with a group and I like playing with
groups; I don't like playing just with
pick-up groups and, like, I'm not Bo
Diddley—I just can't get up there and
do it with anybody. I have to have me
own group.

Who were your musiral idols?

Oh, the Velvet Underground, Iggy
(Pop), MC5, people like that. Just
American rock and roll...things we
thought were great and still do. A lot

of those sorts of things English peo-

ple have always picked up on; the
sort of underground side of Ameri-
can ' rock and roll; like Gene
Vincent—and not many people over
here even know who he is. I can say
"Gene Vincent" and people'll look at
you and, "Who the _fuck's he?" and
you're in the heart of where he came
from! So, we're always into that, just
as much as we were into German
electronic groups years ago—in the
early '70s. So, thank God there was a
bit. of New York Dolls and a bit of
great German music! Americans and
Germans were saving our hides at
that time, while English people were
into terrible things!

Do you think English people try to lie /'lHIt’Yl-
(an in a way?

Oh, no, no-—I just mean there's a
kind of interplay; we kind of picked
up on each other's good -music, that's
what was great—we interacted.
What kind of happened, which I
think is a drag, is that it's sort of
stopped happening. That's what
made it so hard for a lot of the Eng-
lish things that have happened to

make any impact in America. As for
America improving on its musical
culture...instead of lots of new
things and exciting things happen-
ing, it's all been rather staid and laid-
out. Like radio people made their
minds up what they're gonna play.
But now, again, it's the people
demanding what they want and I
think that's great. It's like America's
really starting to shift again’ in terms
of trying to make up its mind wha’t"it
was; it went through such heavy
times in the '60s and '70s, but now it
seems to be demanding things again
...demanding new things as well as
wanting the old things. They want
something for the '80s. We can't just
rely on the "good old days"—these
should be the "good old days" for us!
Fuck the '60s! They had their time,
let's have ours.

You're one of a handful of performers who's
still maintaining a punk image. Why? ls it
important to you?

I just got the image; it's just me. I
mean, I haven't got a big car or a lot of
money or anything, but I've got
things which I think are more impor-
tant than that. I think that being in a
group and being able to play music
and do what I want in today's age is a
luxury. Better than what most peo-
ple have to do; I mean, they have to
do what other people tell them. I do
what I want. Mind you, I pay the
penalty of it—there's no pension, no
rock and roll pension or nothing, but
who gives a shit? I don't want a pen-
sion. I want to live for now, not

T tomorrow. I'm very lucky. A lot of

people are on the dole queue and
standing there with nothing, and
they've got three kids and a wife and
all that...it's happening in England
and America and I think that's
another reason why the countries are
getting together again—we've got
the same problems. But yeah, I'm
lucky, I can do what I want, thank
God. A lot of other people are really
in a bad way. That's why I'm into this
idea of making it so people can dance
to the music as well as think about it.

My real name is Big Bill Barkley— how do I get to the Big Valley?

 

- do——most people do real crummy

 

That way, if they don't want to think
of thebad’ side of it, they don't have
to. Why should they have to suffer

' more than, you know, digging coal

every day, which is what most people

 

 

 

jobs, and I'm sure they don't want to
be reminded of it all the time.

What are your thoughts on /imerican radio?

What's so great about American
radio is that you can really listen to
so many different things. For
instance, in England there's no such
thing as black stations; it's just like
Radio One, Two, Three, and Four
and local commercial stations, which
are growing, but still. aren't very

important or very good. Whereas, ’

here , radio is absolutely wild in terms
of choice! But there again, there's
virtually no choice at all; like, the
ratings just kind of control every-
thing. So it's like a censorship. You
don't have that in England——you
have a government station that tends
to stay open and cover all sorts of
things. It's really weird to think
there's all these stations here (in the
U.S.), but it's really controlled. I just
think it's good that people them-
selves are changing the ratings so
they're putting it back in their own
pool. That's what people should do:
demand things and then they'll get
them, and they won't be at the mercy
of these people who run these
corporations.

Can you pirture you rselfstill doing what you
do now when you're say, 50 years old?

No, I don't really intend on doing this
then—I certainly hope I go out
before then! It seems like it'd be silly.
Anyway, I can't imagine myself
doing this kind of music at 50—I
might be doing something else.

Like what?

I dunno. I'll just have to find some-
thing else I'm interested in!

FOREVER NOW
Psychedelic Furs
Columbia

There's two ways to look at
this one. Either the Psychedelic
Furs decided that they wanted
to inject themselves into the
mainstream of lip-glossed pop
or they thought that it was time
to move on along the fringe of
fashion—a place where this
band has always chosen to
remain. Judging from the atti-
tude of their, first two releases,
the latter theory probably holds

nTPhe main difference between
Forever Now and the previous
Furs albums is production——
namely that of Todd Rundgren.
Where former producer Steve

THE ANIMATION GENERA-
TION

Novo Combo

Polydor

In certain battles, it's best not
to recognize the enemy, and yet
recent albums (The Who's It's
Hard, for one) have been depict-
ing the video-crazed armies that
have rock-n-roll by the joy
sticks. Novo Combo's The Ani-
mation Generation is another artsy
address to the war of disposable
income and that's fine, but
shouldn't the music have some-
thing to say as well?

Novo Combo showed prom-
ise on last year's debut, Novo
Combo, but The /lnirnation Cenera—
tion may have to be written off
as a sophomoric jinx. Although
they were clearly several
notches below in their musi-
cianship and lyrical scope, Novo
Combo delivered the same combi-
nation of pop-rock-reggae that
the world has come to love as
The Police. Songs like "Up Peri-
scope" and "City Bound ('E'
Train)" moved one into spasms
of dance and still inspired
second and third listenings.

The material on The Animation
Generation is disposable after the
first listen. Novo Combo con-
tinues to vein third-world per-
cussions, but the remaining part
of the mix is as indistinct as an
"anyone can play" organ.

Lyrically, Novo Combo seems

Lilywhite complemented the
Furs’ somewhat scathing lyrics
and music with his fuzzy, dis-
torted, almost Spectorish tech-
nique, Rundgren has glossed
over many of the Furs’ jagged
edges with his "this is how
American pop should sound”
production. The result is sort of
a mutation—a paradox between
the Psychedelic Furs’ music and
the way it actually sounds. If
that was the intention, well, it
worked. Otherwise, it seems to
cool some of the band's fire.
However, the Furs still man-
age to sizzle. Music—wise, the
album has a much more com-
pact sound, especially with the
departures of saxophonist Dun-
can Klibgurn, guitarist Roger
Morris and drummer Vince Ely
(who left after Forever Now was
recorded.) This leaves the Psy-
chedelic Furs as a quartet
including vocalist Richard
Butler, new drummer Phil Cla-
vert, bassist Tim Butler and
John Ashton on guitars. Also
included on the album are Gary
Window and Donn Adams of
NRBQ, who take care of the
horns. With this upheaval has
come a slightly different sound
for the band. While the first two

drawn to pop-profundity a la
Rush with songs like "Welcome
Innervision," and "Chained
Man." "She Runs" starts off
great with an irresistible reggae
beat, but by mid-song you're
wondering "The bass, where's
the bass?" "Keep Your Love
Alive” contains an accoustic gui-
tar and sounds very much like
something REO has done/will
do.

I'll keep on listening to "Up
Periscope" etc., until this band
can re—focus on their music and
leave the hollow commentaries
on modern man to Heavy Metal
morons. On The /lnimatz'on Gener-
ation, what you see——the four
band members modelling the
spoils of success—is, unfortu-
nately, what you get.

MAD ABOUT TOWN
Slow Children
Ensign/RCA

Slow Children, like the traffic
sign of the same name, annoys
you to the point where you'll
find yourself wanting to do the
opposite (run 'em down!). As far
as originality goes, they're par
for the course (who else sings
songs with titles like "Unplug—
ging the Vacuum"and "Vanessa
Vacillating".7)., but the music
and execution make me want to
gag; too cute, too fast, too
yeecchh!

‘ PSYCI-IEDELIC FURS

  

   

albums concentrated on a more
rhythmic approach, Forever Now
dwells more on melodies. (Com-
pare "Love My Way" with
"India.") In addition, the saxo-
phones and horns play a much
more prominent role on Forever
Now than on previous albums.
Where, in the past, Duncan Kli-
burn's sax was used almost sub-
consciously to weave in and out
of the rhythms (on Psychedelic
Furs and Talk, Talk, Talk,) Win-
dow's and Adams’ horns are
brought out front with some
melodies of their own. The
result is a very American horn
sound that starts to resemble,
but mercifully falls short of, say,
an Asbury Jukes section. Aside
from all that, Ashton's guitars
still manage to mesmerize and
Butler's bass still thunders with
that familiar, subtly sinister
sound that is undeniably the
Psychedelic Furs.

Then there is Richard Butler.
With Forever Now, this former art
student has written some of his
best material lyrically. On this
album, Butler's theme seems to
deal with personal freedoms
and their restrictions.
"Love My Way," which asks for
sexual freedom, to the political

Mad About Town is ridiculously
similar to Slow Children's debut
release of 1981—come to think
of it, it could be that same
album, for I can discern no dif-
ference. Aha—that's it! They
just designed a new album
cover, changed a few words and
song titles and presto—instant
"new LP!" Oh well, that's
nothing new, considering Fleet-

campaign implications of "Presi-
dent Gas," to the fevered love
warnings of "Danger," Butler
finds a way, like Elvis Costello,
to sneer at just about anything.
However, this isn't the same
anger that Costello embodies.
Instead, it's more of a mocking
disbelief at some of today's
accepted norms and practices.
Where Costello shows his
wounds at street level, Butler
always finds a high horse to
taunt from—usually unscathed.
In addition, this album also
marks a great deal more of
coherence and realism in
Butler's songwriting--for the
time being.

Although rabid Furs fans may
be disappointed at Rundgren's
slick production and the inher-
ent quasi-mainstream sound
that follows, Forever Now is none-
theless a primo album. It marks
a progression in the Furs’ style,
and highlights the fact that this
band is not afraid to change.
Sure, standing still in quicksand
will prevent one from sinking,
but the Psychelic Furs have
always kept themselves well out
of the quagmire. Forever Now
shows that now is not forever.

OVER THE RAINBOW
Judy Garland
Music For Pleasure, Ltd.

A Judy Garland album? Why
not? There are plenty of Judy
Garland fans out there, even
some in the record buying age
group of 13 to 30. This new
collection of Judy Garland's
songs is just the thing for those
fans. The collection, Over The
Rainbow, contains 16 of some of
her most well known songs.
Among them are such classics as
”For Me and My Gal," "On the
Sunny Side of the Street,"
"You'll Never Walk Alone,"
”The Trolley Song," "That Old
Black Magic,” "I’ve Got
Rhythm," "Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas," "You
Made Me Love You," and, of
course, "Over the Rainbow."

Garland's rendition of "Over
the Rainbow," heartfelt and
moving, becomes especially
touching when one considers
her life story. A performer since
early childhood, a contract with
MGM started her life as a movie
actress and her rise to national
fame. Yet, for all her achieve-
ments and acclaim, Judy Gar-
land never found true happiness
in life and died at the age of 47.

The sound of Over The
Rainboio, though in mono, is very
good considering the age of the
original recordings. Since this
album is sure not to be a big
seller, you will have to look hard
to find it. I bought my copy at
the Record Outlet at a very
reasonable price. Over The
Rainbow would make a perfect
gift for a musically—minded
mom or dad, or anyone who

levee the old musicals.

SREAMING BLUE MURDER
Girlschool
Epic .
Deep in the tormented soulof
every male American who grew
up in the '70s and ever got sick
on a six—pack in ninth grade is a
secret passion for Heavy Metal.
Sometimes, this is ajlatent infat-
uation; sometimes, it is a burn-
ing urge to flail the air with an

 

I all-girl outfit named Girlschool,

invisible Stratocaster. ,What-
ever its manifestation, the
opening riffs of ”Whole Lotta
Love" or ”Paranoid" will induce
Pavlovian responses from most
of the adult male population in
this land of ours. Heavy Metal is
like the crazy cousin of the fam-
ily; nobody wants to admit it,
but everybody can't help feeling
a slight surge of nostalgia at the
memory of Alice Cooper's Billion
Dollar Babies tour. I was there, I
know...I remember. I thought
I'd forgotten, but wonder of
wonders, I slap on this disc by an

and my foot taps, my sinuses
unclog and I start thinking of
cutting school and cherry
bombs and all those old high
school memories. Yeah! Get
DOWN! ‘

Nuge, move over. David Lee,
get lost. Girlschool is here, and
they're out for blood. Somehow
affiliated with Motorhead,
these honeys play it LOUD and
do it with a pretty good amount
of proficiency. They know the
licks, they know the hooks, and
they even do passable covers; in
this case, Z.Z.Top’s old smoker,
”Tush." This is Joan Jett with-
out the pop sensibility, and I bet
they'll love it in Detroit. So, the
next time you feel like chugging
some brewskis and blasting the
neighbors, along with yourself,
int_o decorticated Jello, grab a
copy of Screaming Blue Murder.
One final note: for some
strange unfathomable reason,
these girls appeal to punks in
Britain. Large masses of the
breed turn up at their shows.
Don't ask me why. This music
has as much to do with safety
pins and left-wing rhetoric as
your grandmother. This is
music for corporate America.

SUBURBAN VOODOO
Paul Carrack
EPIC

Ifothe talents of Paul Carrack
are any indication, the recently
announced breakup of Squeeze
could be a blessing, providing
Difford and Tilbrook can go on
supplying pop music with their
talented understudies. Suburban
Voodoo, Carrack's first solo
effort since departing from
Squeeze last year, is a promising
debut that contains 12 three-
minute songs in true pop-music
form.

Under the knowing ear of
producer Nick Lowe, Carrack's
ability to fashion an irresistible
melody comes through as his
wailing organ springs from the

Squeeze—like sound. Textures
are provided by Carrack's
vocals, a mix of the two shades

of soul—Wislon Pickett's power

and edge and the lushness of
The Righteous Brothers.

With 12 songs on the album,
repetition could have been a
problem, but Carrack mixes the
styles, approaching everything
from funk, with "Out of
Touch," to country-swing, with
"What A Way To Go."

’’I Need You," the album's
first single, reminds me of
Squeeze’s "Tempted," which
Carrack also sang; it retains a
danceable quality despite its
slow tempo. ”Don’t Give My
Heart A Break" and "I Found
Love" share that Motown-
sound of Four Top's hits such as
"Bernadette."

The intensity level of Suburban
Voodoo could use a shot or two of
guitar, but if it's a level ride
through pop-fantasy you're
after, then this is the vehicle to
take.

If Kenny Loggins fans are
expecting another Celebrate Me
Home, they may be slightly dis-
appointed after listening to his
latest, High Adventure.

Although High Adventure does

have abandoned his mastery of
the love ballad for a ”now we're
having a good time" (his words)
mentality.

The music and lyrics are fun,
but often the acoustics get in
the way of Loggins’ voice. In the
Top 40 hit, "Don’t Fight It"
(with Journey's Steve Perry),
Loggins winds up screaming
most of the lyrics to have his
voice heard above the screech-
ing guitars. .
By far, the two best songs on
the album are the ones that fea-
ture the old Loggins style.
”Only a Miracle" (also written
with McDonald) is about Log-
gins’ young son and is the most
sophisticated cut on the album.
Following an all-strings prelude
by Marty Paich, the song is a
lavish production that seems to
belong in a movie soundtrack.

stuff-—a broken heart and a
guitar-—that made Loggins
what he is today. His voice has
no problems here. ”The More
We Try" is ‘and indication that
Loggins still has the ability to
sing the love ballad—and sing it
with style.

Despite a few flaws, Loggins
fans will enjoy this album, and
he might even gain a few
"unsures."

The Pitt News, Friday October 29, 1982

Can Julius Dawkins and the Pitt offense come alive against Louisville?

.-.-.

"Joe McCall:

Will Have

By IRA M. KATZ

It often happens that so many
young athletes are foretold by
coaches, media and fans how far
their capabilities stretch.

Panther junior running back Joe

"Q?-Mc(Iall came to Pitt with the nick-

names “Do it all” and “Slasher,”
and even some Blue and Gold
faithful thought he would be the
next Tony Dorsett.

In 1980, his freshman year,
McCall showed signs of the bril-
liance that had preceded his college
playing days at Pitt. He rushed for
453 yards as halfback.

Then, in 1981, McCall picked up
where he left off the previous sea-
son, rushing for 71 yards against
Illinois in the opener.

The rest of that season proved to
be a nightmare for McCall. He only
rushed for 109 more yards the entire
season.

“Last year I had a couple of men-
tal and physical let downs, so this

— year I decided to come out and dedi-

cate myself to helping the team,"
McCall said. “I’m pleased with the
way things have progressed since
last year.”

McCall came to Pitt from Jack-
son High School in Miami, Florida
whre he kept the Pitt-Jackson con-
nection intact. Such former Pitt
stars as Cecil Johnson, Elliot
Walker and Arnie Weatherington
had all found their way north to
Pitt from Jackson.

In high school, McCall earned
four football and as many track let-
ters. He was named Inner-City
Back of the Year in both his junior
and senior years.

Former Panther coach Jackie
Sherrill recruited McCall for Pitt.
Sherrill was no stranger to
Mc(Zall—he had coached his

Chance To “Do It All” ThisWeekend 

brother Michael Strachan at Iowa
State. Strachan later went on to
play football for the New Orleans
Saints.

So far, football at Pitt has been
one monstrous rollercoaster for
McCall. For each up, there has
been a down.

“Sometime in your life you are
always going to be down, but you
have to put that in the past and
think that you’re never going to be
in that position again,” McCall
said.

When the Panthers host Louis-
ville tomorrow, McCall will have
an opportunity to contribute and
maybe spark a Pitt offense which
has been erratic so far this season.

An injury to starting fullback
Bill Beach gave McCall a chance to
see some playing time last week
against Syracuse. He carried the
ball six times for 35 yards and had
four receptions for 24 yards.

The Panther offenseihas shown
signs of improvement over the past
few games but hasn’t scored many
points in the process.

“I think we are doing the best we
can, but it's the little things that

have held us back from punching.

the ball across the goal line,"
McCall said. J
McCall knows that Pitt has to be

careful not to look past Louisville
to Notre Dame, who follows the

Cardinals’ tracks into Pitt
Stadium.
“I'm not taking Louisville

lightly at all—-they have at good
team,” McCall offered. “We are
going to go out in this game and try
to improve."

So, as the Panthers -make a bid
for a national championship, Joe
.\Ic(Zall figures to play an increas-
ingly larger role. 7 -

Will Louisville
Kick-Return

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The Louisville Cardinal football
team. Not quite enough to cast fear
into opposing coaches. Surely
Foge Fazio will not be awakened by
haunting thoughts tonight. No
ghosts from years past. Pitt has
won twice in as many chances, 27-6
six years back and 4l-23 two years
ago.

Then again, the same was said
before last week’s game against
Syracuse. Blowout. No business
being on the same field. Squeeze
those Orangemen till they crush.

It never happened. What makes
tomorrow’s matchup between 6-0
Pitt and 3-4 Louisville more than
just an exercise in formality. It’s
someone from above staring down
upon Fazio and saying, “Here,
consider Louisville a gift from
above. Use those Cardinals to get
the offense going. And keep the
defense intact.” '

Louisville has been a gift for
many an offense this season. In
four losses to-Cincinnati, Miami,

Temple and Southern Mississippi,
the Cardinals have given up 169
points. That's over three times
.-more than the 56 points that Pitt
has surrendered over a six game
span.

But Fazio is not about to thank
the gods just yet. Perhaps he
extended his hand a bit prema-
turely last week. Maybe he’s still-
upset with what they sent down for
the first four games of the season.

“Louisville is a very physical
football team,”. Fazio said at Pitt’s
weekly press conference this past
Tuesday. “The defense is excep-
tionally aggressive.”

Is he serious? Louisville? The
Louisville Cardinals? He has
ample reason to have already
popped the corks. Perhaps he

means the Louisville Cardinal bas- '
ketball team. What’s that, Foge?

You say you’re serious.

Maybe he is. Fazio was wary of
Syracuse and Temple in weeks past
when the chalk players were toss-
ing three touchdowns around. If

Joe McCal_l, who earned the
nickname “do it all” in high
school, will have a chance to
live up to the title when Pitt

Netters
End At

Big East”

By TIM DINGER

The Lady Panther teIInis team
enters the final stage of the season
when it travels to Concord, N.Y., to
compete in the Big East
Championships.

The Pitt squad goes into the
tournament with an 8-2 record
Imder coach George Dieffenbach.

A loss to Bucknell last Wednes-
day in the final regular season
match has caused Dieffenbach to
work the team hard this past
week—preparing for the outstaIId-
ing teams that will enter the
tournament.

For seniors Cathy Jacobson, Lisa
LaFuria and Linda Stadler, a loss
would mean the end of three suc-
cessful careers at Pitt.

Jacobson, Pitt’s No. 1 singles
player and team captain, is a three
year letter winner. She has com-
bined singles and‘ doubles matches
for a 27-6 record over the last three
years. A

Pitt's No. 2 singles player, Lisa

LaFuria, ended the season with an
8-2 singles record and a 7-2 doubles

record.

Linda Stadler played volleyball

In baseball circles he is known as
Lefty. Unless you read the news-

. "papers or reside within the perime-

ters of Philadephia, you would
probably guess this guy to be some
Mafia hit-man.

His name is Steve Carlton, and
he just set a precedent by being
awarded the National League Cy
Young Award—-baseball’s recogni-
tion to the top pitcher of each
season.

But why is so little known about
Carlton? Why is it that if you lived
on the same block as he does you
probably wouldn’t know it?

Well, over his many star-studded
years‘, Carlton has been victim, on
more than one occasion, of run-ins

,_‘g:-grtith the media. Therefore, Silent

Steve does not engage in informa-
tive and enlightening chats with
the press.

That is quite a shame. Generally
speaking, sports exists to entertain
the masses. Baseball is no excep-
tion, and it is Qven played during
summer, the most enjoyable part of
the year.

It can be argued that sports is
more business-oriented than fun-
oriented, as evidenced by the cur-
rent grief being generated by the
NFL owners and the players’
union (NFLPA). But the fact
remains—the public pays to walk

Vgttwtihrough turnstyles to observe per-

i formers who are special because of
their distinct athletic talents.

Which brings us to Carlton,
unquestionably one of the best per-
formers in baseball. But he refuses
to share his experiences and
thoughts with the masses-all
because he felt that the media gave
him the shaft when he did talk with
themf

Carlton takes all the excitement
and _grandeur out of basel)all. He
plays the great American
pastime—apple pie, Chevrolet and
neat moms. Youngsters dreaming
of slugging 500 HRs or saving 30
games a season when they get
older. Baseball—catch the fever.

But no. Instead, one of the
.game’s perennial stars chooses to

‘§i"iisr)late himself from this sports-

consuming country of ours because
he feels he has not been treated in a
just and fair manner. Therefore, he
retaliates and deflates that big
colorful balloon in the sky that
symbolizes the grand old game.

To go a little further, I will rattle
off some statistics proving Carl-
ton’s sovereignty on the mound.
His league-leading strikeout total
this past season (286) leaves him
only 70 shy of Walter Johnson's

2, top mark. He's in_ his 12th year
‘<,;?§\'itlr the Phillies. Next year will be
his l7th in the majors. And Carlton.

even recorded 23 wins after an 0-1
start this season.

Is it too unrealistic to say Carlton
ts invincible?

Presently, there are six Panthers

Both defenses played well. Pitt’s
offense had difficulty controlling
the ball against the quick-moving
midfield of Penn State.

“We didn’t work the ball as well
as we should have,” said coach Leo

Bemis. “We didn’t take advantage
of the few chances we had.”

Some  
Extra

Tickets

By DALE MOORE

Christmas has arrived early for
some residents of this city. For a
select and lucky few, it has come
without snow or songs or reindeer,

and it has taken a strange form.«._" _.> i

has come in the form of a present, a
very rare present indeed. It is one
which must be usedibefore Dec. 25,
since it will become worthless after
next Saturday. The present is a
ticket to the Pitt-Notre Dame
game.

This ticket, considering the con-
tinuing pro football strike, is prob-
ably the most sought after ticket in
the Pittsburgh area right now. It
has been said that some seats are
being scalped for $40 a ducet.

The game was announced a sell
out quite a while ago, even with the
installation of temporary bleachers
in Pitt Stadium. So how did the
lucky few get tickets to the game?

They just asked. But they asked at g

the right place. 

Although the game has been sold
out for well over a month, accord-
ing to the stadium ticket office, any
person could have walked to the
ticket office in the Student Union
this week and purchased $12 gen-
eral admission seats for the game.

If there are still tickets available,
why are people paying so much to
acquire them by illegal means?
Because they don’t know that
tickets are still available. That the,“
Student Union has been SClliﬁ‘g’:
Pitt-Notre Dame tickets is the best
kept secret on campus. The sta-
dium ticket office has a recording
saying the game is a sellout. When
calling the ticket office for addi-
tional information. they are again
reassured.

By BRIAN BALK

The NFI. players strike is on day
47 and still no hope for a settleiiieirt
can be seen on the horizon. A new

league (the IISFI.) proved it was for

real by annouiicingits opening day
in jiily. But covllege footl)all is one
faction of the game which has not
undergotie any type of drastic
change. College football will
always be a mainstay which fans
can look forward to week after
week, year after year.

So let's ptit aside contract negoti-
ations a_i-id new football franchise
openings and focus on this week’s
collegiate inatchups. Here are my
predictions for this weekend:

PITT vs. LOUISVILLE: The
Panthers are 6-0, and the Cardinals
present no real threat to snap their
winning streak. Although ‘the
Panther squad is riddled with
bumps and bruises, Louisville will
not be able to take advantage of
their iniuries. Last weekend if you

Boston College 10.

WEST VIRGINIA vs. EAST
CAROLINA: Although Jeff Hos-
tetler will miss action in this game
(due to the weekly sadistic defen-
sive line pounding), East Carolina
will not be able to capitalize on
WVU's misfortune. The Pirates
have a fine squad, but nothing
comparable to the Mountaineers
depth and talent. WVU will up
their winning record. WVU 21,
East Carolina l0.

NOTRE DAME vs. NAVY:
Notre I)airie will attempt to save

lands. Evidence shows that they
most likely will do it. The Mid-
shipmen are much improved
(thanks to the realigning job of
head coach Gary Traiiqiiill, for-
merly of WVU). The improve-
ment, however, will not curtail the
aggresive drive of the Fighting
Irish. Notre 17, Navy 10.

imprint.

 

sey. will go head to head with the
best the Pac 10 has to offer—the
Huskies. Stanford would have a
legitimate shot at an upset if they
had anything that resembled a def-
ensive unit. Elway will achieve
another 300-yard game, but his arm
will not carry Stanford to victory.
Washington 3], Stanford 28.

OHIO STATE vs. PURDUE:
The Buckeyes are having an off sea-
son, but they're not that off the
track to lose to the dreadful Boiler-
makers. The Buckeyes may not be
able to overtake the top rung in the
Big Ten, btit they will regain some
conference respect with a win.
OSU 24, Purdue 10.

ILLINOIS vs. IOWA: The Illini
will be psyched going into this
game after their eleventh-hour win
over Wiscoiison last week. Tony
Eason, with an effective receiving
corps, will be ready to trounce
Iowa. Believe it or not, llliiiois is
heading for a Big Ten title this
year. Illinois 24, Iowa 10

SOUTHERN METHODIST vs.

FLORIDA STATE vs. MIAMI
OF FLORDA: Is there any truth to
the Orange Bowl jinx that Florida
State claims afflicts them every
year? Head coach Bobby Bowdeti
will be able to give it aiiotlier try to
see if the “()i‘;iiige (Iurse" really
exists. Miami is good. l)tit FSU is
on a roll. Florida State will tri-
umph due to its momentum. FSU
28, Miami 27.

NORTH CAROLINA vs.
MARYLAND: One of the biggest
surprises of the year is that Mary-
land is indeed worthy of Division I
football. The Terrapins though,
hven’t matured into a dominating
Eastern power just yet. North
Carolina has only suffered one loss
this year—Arid you know who that

was to. They are not about to lose;

to the still—green Terrapins. North
Carolina 21, \/Iaryland l0.

ARIZONA STATE vs. USC:
Arizona has shown that its offense
can lead them to the top of the
polls. USC will go all out to dis-
continue their good fortune. The
Trojans would have a valid chance
if they weren’t so depleted in the
running back category. Arizona
State 17. USC l0.

ARKANSAS vs. RICE: Once the
Razor Backs get through with the
Owls they will wish they had
stayed home in the paddies. Arkan-
sas will make pudding out of Rice’. ;
Arkansas 42, Rice 7.

 

 

TEXAS vs. TEXAS TECH: This
intrastate rivalry always proves to
be an exciting bout. But this year,
the Long Horns are just too litige.

Texas Tech will not present too

much of a challenge this weekend.
Texas 23, Texas Tech 10.

MICHIGAN STATE vs. INDI-
NIA: It is not too often that a quar-
terback will pass over 400 yards and
still lose, but Indiana's Babe Lau-
fenberg, a precise passer, did it last
week against Ohio State. Laufen-
berg will not let that crazy situation

occur again. Indiana 32, Michigan

State 14.

OREGON vs. UCLA: Unfortu-
nately, tying the Fighting Irish I3-
13 last weekend will be the
highlight of the entire season for
Oregon. If the Ducks ever win a
game, it surely will not be at the
Rose Bowl. UCLA 27, Oregon 10.

ALABAMA vs. MISSISSIPPI
STATE: The Bear will try all his
options, reverses and audibles, at
Mississippi State this weekend.
With quarterback Walter Lewis’
running and passing abilities, it
sould be an easy walkover for the
Crimson Tide. Alabama 28, Missis-
sippi State 7.

It appears they were lying.
According to Mel Cratslev, the
manager of the ticket office, the
truth 15 being told.

Cratsley said that the stadium
ticket office has no more tickets for
next week’s game. Therefore, they
are sold out.

“However, " said Cratsley, “the
Student Union may still have
tickets left. We assume that they
have sold them or will sell them all
before the game on Saturday.”

According to Cratsley, the tickets
at the Student Union are there to
benefit the students. “The Student
Union requested the tickets a long
time ago so they would have some-
thing to sell to the kids when the
date tickets ran out," he said.

Those who bought the tickets
yesterday didn't care why, when or
how the tickets got there, only that
they were there. Brian Foster, a
freshman engineering major,
bought four tickets.

“I have four friends who want to
come in for the game,” Foster said.

“I tried to buy tickets when I first 8

came here in September and

couldn‘t. I’m glad I got these.

Although the tickets will be gone
after next Saturday, the memories
of the game will linger for a long
time. For those who bought tickets
after the game was sold out, it will
be even more memorable. These
people, it could be said, have been
blessed by the luck of the Irish.

TIIE ll1'E BEER All-STARS

STRIKE AGAIN.      

Teammate Ben Davidson felt
Rodney deserved a break, or
at least a fracture. Billy Martin
didn't argue with that. Jim
Honochick couldn’t believe his
eyes. Neither could Marv

Throneberry.
So the First Lite Beer
Bowling Tournament
ended in a draw. And '
the argument over the
best thing about Lite
was left unsettled.
But there was one
thing everyone agreed
on. it was truly every-
   thing you always
‘ "  wanted in a bowling
tournament. And less.

When famous bowler Don
Carter invited 23 Kingpins to
the First Lite Beer Bowling
Tournament, it seemed like a
great idea.

It was thegguys who drink
Lite Beer fro.m Miller
because it tastes great,
against the guys_who
drink it because it’s less
filling. And once again,
the All—Starslproved
they’re in a league by
themselves. ' -

After a lot of pins
(and quite a few Lite
Beers) went down and
the smoke finally
cleared, the score was

tied, with only one man left to go.
Rodney Dangerfield. A
Allhe needed to win itwas one

V pin. Aklutz situation. Rodney, in .
top form, gotthe same amount of
pins as he gets respect. None.

From left to right: Bubba Smith. Dick Butkus. Frank Robinson. Jim Honochick. Ray Nitschke. Ben Davidson. Don Carter. Billy Martin. Matt Snell.

this week? Pitt‘s eight cylinder
  2  about four so far this season.
Louisville's began on only four

and has coasted downhill ever

‘ since. The Cardinals were shutout
by Southern Mississippi last week

48-0.
' Louisville's chances lie in its
. \ I speed and kick return teams.
, Quarterback Dean May has. at

times, been successful in throwing
to swift re(‘ei\'ers Mark Clayton and
Keith Humphries. (Ilayton is con-
sidered a pro prospect, despite his
smallish 5-10, l75—lb. frame.

“They’re quick and as talented
as any we've faced this year," Fazio
said. “May has a strong arm and
can get it to them if he is given the
time."

Will he have the time? No other
quarterbacks have so far this sea-
son. Panther pursuers have given
opposing signal callers enough
time to take the snap, few steps
backwards and a punishing blow
from a monster of a linetnan. Pitt
averages seven sacks a game.

The Cardinal kick return teams
should fare much better than its
quarterback. Humphries led the
nation in kickoff returns last week,
racing eight times for 253 yards and
a 31.6 average. Humphries, who
was third in the nation in punt

once this season.

Frank Minnifield has returned
punts seven times for M0 yards this
season; his longest was an 88-

~ yarder. I;ast year,~he’le(l.th'e nation
in kickoff returns.

“We’ll have to be alert with the
kicking game," Fazio said. “It can
break the game open for them."

It sounds as if Fazio may have
some haunting thoughts after all.
