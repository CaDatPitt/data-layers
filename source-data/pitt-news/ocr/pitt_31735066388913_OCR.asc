helped Randy, a student at the
Western Pennsylvania School for
Blind Children, light the Greek
Week torch to mark the offical
begining of Pitt's 1988 Greek
Week last night at a reception in
the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

”Greek Week 1988 is a special
time, a time to dedicate ourselves
in the spirit of friendship  a time
to remember,” said Hunn.

Greek Week goals for 1988 in-
clude raising $75,000 for the
Western Pennsylvania School for
Blind Children and collecting
1800 pints of blood for the Cen-
tral Blood Bank.

Pitt to restrict smoking to designated areas of campus

By Scot Ross
Staff vvﬁiter

A smoking policy that would
restrict the areas on campus in
which students and faculty can
smoke is set to go into effect on
April 11.

Created by the Office for Affir-
mative Action, the new policy
restricts smoking in most univer-
sity buildings, including stair-
wells, conference rooms and
hallways.

As well, all cafeterias, restaur-
ants and club facilities must
designate at least a 25 percent
nonsmoking area. Private offices
and residence halls are to be
either smoking or nonsmoking,

depending on the wishes of the
occupants.

Campus buses and vans that
follow regular routes will also for-
bid smoking.

Affirmative Action Director
Maryann Coffey explained that
the university has been contem-
plating the move since _fall of
1986.

”We did a survey of the univer-
sity community in the spring of
1987. At that time, it was disco-
vered the majority of faculty, staff
and students were nonsmokers.
At the same time, this office was
hearing from other offices where
there was friction between smok-
ers and nonsmokers,” said
Coffey.

Coffey noted that the recent
adoption of a smoking policy
throughout the city of Pittsburgh
acted as a catalyst for creating
Pitt's policy.

It's fair to smokers
and nonsmokers. It
considers both.

While unable to give specific
punitive details, Coffey said that
violators would be brought be-
fore the Student Judicial Board for
appropriate action.

people don't smoke in elevators

Board to reconsider golf club’s

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Because of a mistake in filing
a Student Government travel re-
quest form, the Panther Golf Club
asked for over $9,000 more than
it intended to request for its an-
nual golf trip, according to the
club’s vice president and the Al-
locations Committee chair-
person.

The request will be resubmitted
to the Student Government Board
at Monday's meeting.

The SGB last week denied the
club’s $12,383.56 request which,
according to the request form,
was to cover lodging, transporta-
tion, publicity, supplies and in-

structional clinics for 30
members. The board did approve
$1,368.56 to cover half the cost
of transportation.

Following a Pitt News article
concerning the reqest, Mark
Mooney, vice president of the
Golf Club, sent a letter to The Pitt
News in which he denied the
club requested $12,000.

Mooney said in the letter, ”The
Pitt News reported that the golf
club’s request was over $12,000,
when, in fact, it was $3,383.56."

According to Karen Bohichik,
Allocations Committee chairper-
son, the club did request
$12,383.56.

"We wanted money for trans-
portation; we intended to pay for

our own lodging,” said Mooney,
who was responsible for prepar-
ing the request. .

According to the travel request
form, each of the club’s 30 mem-
bers would be required to con-
tribute $300 toward the trip.
Mooney said he was under the
impression that the $9,000 would
be deducted from the total cost
of the trip. Therefore, the club’s
officers thought they were re-
questing $3,383.56.

”Matt [Lemmons, Allocations
liaison to the Golf club] looked
at the form before we turned it
in,” said Mooney. ”He said it was
correct; he said it was fine.”

According to Bohichik, ”Matt’s
role is to make sure everything is

and places historically posted as
nonsmoking,” Coffey believes

- that enforcing this policy will not

be a difficult task.

When asked about the new
policy, most students supported
it because they feel it will lessen
the conflict between smokers and
nonsmokers but also will uphold
the rights of both parties.

Freshman Brian Kubit said, ”lt's
good. I don't like smoking at all.
I think that if there's going to be
places to smoke, that's fine. I
mean, they have a right to smoke,
but it should be in a separate area
for smoking. And if you can stand
it, go in."

Timmie Boyle, a junior major-
ing in English literature agreed,

”lt’s fair to smokers and nons-
mokers. It considers both.”

Some students feel that the
policy may also curtail some of
the health risks involved with
smoking.

Tony Caruso, a senior, said,
”As a smoker, I know that smok-
ing is bad for your health  I feel
this policy is proper in that it
respects the rights of people who
don't smoke.”

Pre-law junior Aggie Beraquit
remarked that it was ”good for
the people who do [smoke] be-
cause they won't be able to
smoke as much, but in the
library, some people need it
when they're studying or cram-
ming," she added.

allocations request

on the right form. He doesn't go
over the forms line by line."

The travel request form was
filled out correctly; the amount
requested was incorrect.

”[Lemmons] would not check
to make sure they understood,”
Bohichik said. «

Neither Lemmons nor Sang
Hong, president of the Golf Club,
could not be reached for com-
ment at presstime.

Mooney also said in his letter,
’’In regards to the fourth para-
graph [of the March 3 article] stat-
ing, ’No members of the Panther
Golf Club were at the meeting to
defend the request,’ is false [sic].
The president and the entire staff
of the Panther Golf Club were

present at the Allocations inter-
view at 6:20 p.m. on Feb. 23 to
present the budget request to the
Student Government Board."

According to Bohichik, the in-
terview to which Mooney
referred concerned the club’s
1988-89 budget, which takes ef-
fect July 1.

”They turned this travel request
in with their budget packet, and
we had to deal with it as an emer-
gency request,” Bohichik said.
”They’re confusing this with their
annual request.”

Regulations governing emer-
gency requests allow members of
clubs to defend their requests be-
fore the SGB votes on the
request.

‘Massive’ Philly prison corruption uncovered

PHILADELPHIA —— Saying a
special investigation uncovered
”a massive network" of corrup-

tion in city prisons, District Attor- -

ney Ronald Castille Tuesday
announced charges against seven
guards and two inmates and said

' there would be more.

Castille said during a press con-
ference outside the Philadelphia
Detention Center that arrests
could reach into the hundreds be-
fore the 18-month probe known
as ”Operation Ferret” is complet-
ed. Officials said the investigation
was prompted by widespread
reports of corruption and com-
plaints within the system.

”The investigation will poten-
tially yield the largest number of
arrests related to official miscon-
duct by correctional officers in
this country's history," Castille
said.

He said it was still too early to
go into specifics that would ex-
plain his comments about the ex-
tent of the problem. l

The first charges stemmed from
two separate incidents, an escape
from Laurel Hall minimum-
security pre-release unit and an

aggravated assault against a
prisoner at a downtown YWCA,
another pre-release facility.

Those named in a grand jury
presentment were charged with
crimes ranging from aggravated
assault to escape.

Castille declined to say how far
back the investigation will go in
looking for criminal activity, nor
would he say how many escapes
were made by inmates aided by
guards who were paid off.

Ozone Ia yer shrinks;

skin cancer cases up

WASHINGTON -— The protec-
tive ozone layer over the United
States appears to have shrunk
about 2.3 percent since 1969,
scientists said today in the most
thorough study yet of ozone
depletion.

Experts have estimated that a 1
percent depletion could mean a
5 percent to 6 percent increase in
skin cancers.

But today's report from the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration, the work of more
than 100 experts over 17 months,
put the annual ozone depletion

over the mid-latitudes of the
northern hemisphere at a much
higher rate.

Those latitudes, 30 degrees to
64 degrees, take in all of the Unit-
ed States except southern Texas,

Louisiana and Florida and extend
halfway up Canada's Yukon Ter-
ritory.

The scientists laid the respon-
sibility for the ozone depletion
squarely on chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), chemicals used to power
some aerosol sprays.

”At this point, there is no other
culprit to blame,” said Sherwood
Rowland of the University of
California at Irvine.

Senate gives its OK

for more foreigners
WASHINGTON -—- The Senate,
on a vote of 88-4, passed legisla-
tion Tuesday to vastly expand op-
portunities for foreign
professionals and skilled workers
to legally enter the United States.

The immigration-overhaul bill
went to the House. Senators Ed-
ward M. Kennedy, D—Mass., and
Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., had
led a bipartisan effort to guide the
measure through the Senate.

The legislation would apply to
those who try to obtain legal
residency through normal U.S.
government channels. Sixteen
months ago, Congress ended a
six—year debate by enacting legis-
lation to curb extensive illegal en-
tries into the United States.

Simpson and Kennedy took
aim at a legal immigration system
in which 90 percent of those
granted visas are admitted be-
cause they have close family
members living legally in this
country. Only 10 percent of the
immigration visas are granted to
fill the needs of the labor market.

The magazine reported in its
March 19 issue that more homes
now have VCRs than have cable
television, and it predicted that
VCR ownership will rise from 53
percent to more than 80 percent
by 1995.

The rapid spread of the ”little
rectangular box” has forced the
television networks to consider
new tactics, such as recommend-

ing viewers to tape shows if.

they’re going to watch others first.

When CBS pitted Tour of Duty
against the top—rated Cosby
Show, the network contemplated
ads saying that if viewers had to
watch Cosby, they owed it to
themselves to at least tape Tour
of Duty. CBS didn't use the ads,
but they probably will use such
tactics someday, the magazine
reported.

CBS and NBC scheduled Satur-
day night programs with VCR
users in mind, knowing that those
evening hours are the prime time
for playing videotapes.

day's Academic Billboard that an

Royal visit is remembered in Pittsburgh

By Gretchen Haller
For The Pitt News

Prince Charles conquered
hearts with his royal charm when
he came to a snow—covered Mon
Valley March 4 for the Remaking
Cities Conference.

Even though he has since
returned to his native land, his in-
fluence continues to affect local
residents, architects, urban plan-
ners and government and univer-
sity officials as they embark on
the implementation of innova-
tions presented during his U.S.
visit.

Already, new conferences are
being planned. Pitt President
Wesley Posvar has announced

that he will sponsor an invitation-
al ”Conference on Milltowns:
Despair, Hopes and Opportuni-
ties.” Approximately TOO com-
munity leaders and faculty will
consider the role the university
can play in the restructuring of
the Mon Valley.

The first international Region-
al Urban Design Assistance
Team, consisting of 17 British and
American experts in urban de-
sign, economics, political
science, transportation and the
environment discussed ways to
spark the Mon Valley's economy.

For five days, the team concen-
trated much study, action and
media attention on turning think-
ing around from reliance on the

steel industry in supporting the
Pittsburgh economy to prodding
residents and planners to take
charge of their own destinies.

Tony McGann, a community
planner from Liverpool, England,
had this to say when the R/U DAT
report was presented to the pub-
lic in Homestead: ’’It’s time to get
off your backsides and get
stokin’.”

Dr. James Cunningham, profes-
sor of social work at Pitt, worked
with the R/U DAT team because
of the school's River Communi-
ties Project, a series of studies
done since 1983 on the crises
caused by unemployment in the
Mon Valley.

”The most important outcome

Viet Phom/The Pitt News

Prince Charles visited Pittsburgh on March 4th and got a dose of cold weather before speaking

on economic recovery tactics.

of my work with the R/UDAT
team,” said Cunningham, ”was
its confirmation of the growing
reality that the Mon Valley can-
not recover unless it starts from
within. It is necessary for local
leaders to get their acts together
and make demands on outside
institutions in order to start their
own recovery.”

Cunningham feels that the
Remaking Cities Conference was
”one of the better ones because
it stimulated alternative visions
and will produce a document
with useful ideas.”

Dr. Morton Coleman, joint
professor of social work at Pitt,
became a contributor to that
document because of his
research into the relationship of
urban change and hammered out
worthwhile recommendations for
all communities, not just
Pittsburgh.

The workshop examined ways
to create new partnerships for de-
velopment with public/private in-
stitutional investment in city
centers, neighborhoods and of
regional issues.

”Pitt’s interest is in the overall
sense of participatory planning,”
said Coleman. ’’In order to get lo-
cal motivation, those affected by
the planning decisions have
some organized voice, have
pools of money available to them
and must build leadership.”

Coleman feels that when build-
ing public/private partnerships,
"themes are more important than
specifics. These partnerships can
create synergy and bring the ac-
tors to the table to cooperate, but

they shouldn't build another lay-
er in an already confusing system,
or take accountability away from
where it belongs. They should do
the job that the public and private
sectors can’t do separately.”

The partnership workshop
grappled with those issues with
recommendations that public
agencies should become less
negative and act as enablers to
help people find financing in ord-
er to turn their self-help aspir-
ations into viable schemes.

The workshop on new eco-
nomic opportunities for cities,
chaired by Paul Farmer, assistant
planning director for the city of
Pittsburgh, discussed linkage as a
concept broader than direct fees
for production of housing, and
tailored to local issues.

One example was the Urban
Development Action Grant from
the federal government for resto-
ration of the Benedum Center.
Through it, repayment came in
providing free and reduced-price
tickets for events in the theater for
low and moderate income elder-
ly and disadvantaged popu-
lations.

”Social equity goals are central
to development policy,” Farmer
said, and he cited the failure of
traditional education in dealing
with the problems of education-
al psychology and cultural atti-
tudes, where ”education is not
highly valued, and a culture of
dependency has developed.”

Non—traditional types of educa-
tion, such as a church—based
computer literacy program for fa-

Continued from page 1

The Opening Ceremony is the
beginning of a 24 day period of
events and fund-raisers.

”The importance of this kick-off
is to introduce the sponsors, the
chairpersons and the others in-
volved and let them know that
Greek Week has begun and that
we need their support to help
these kids," said Daniel Skowron,
co-chairperson of the Opening
Ceremony.

There were several speakers on
hand, including D.J. Jimmy
Roach, who is an honorary chair-
person. ”This is a good humani-
ty test,” said Roach. ’’If you go by
[the Blind School] and can't get
involved, you might as well just
jump into the grave. it is as good
a cause as you can get involved
in.”

Bob O’Conner of Pappan’s-Roy

Rogers, a sponsor of Greek
Week, said, "A famous man once
said ’A man never stands so tall
as when he stoops down to help
a child.’ I think the Pitt Greeks are
standing about 10 feet tall."
A group of nine students from the
school performed after the speak-
ers, singing six songs. They
received a standing ovation.

this year and we've been learn-
ing a lot of songs,” said Blind

Fostering a new class of lead-

all the workshops. The recom-

borhood projects that would act
as incubators for such leadership
development (lashed directly
with the idea of regionalism (with

”l thought [the singing] was
great. I wasn't a bit nervous," said
another student, Jamie Mielcusry.
”Last night, when I was in bed,
I was hoping that there would be
some talent scouts here and
somebody from Motown records
could get me a singing career. I
enjoy singing and I love to dance,
too.”

Some of the events scheduled
to occur the next 10 days are the
Dance Marathon, Chariot Race,
Olympiad, Greek Gorge, God-
Goddess Contest and the Greek
Sing.

”The events look awesome,"
said events co-chairperson Trisha
Pantureri. ”Everything’s coming
together. Of course, right at the
end, everyone seems flustered
because they're nervous. But
everyone knows what they're
doing.”

”We're going to turn some
heads this year. l think people are
really going to be in awe,” said

Ron Bizick, the other events
chairperson.

Marathon, which starts on Friday
at 5 p.m. and end on Saturday at
5 p.m., 24 hours later. Each frater-
nity and sorority are required to
have between 20 and 45 percent
of their members dancing, and
each dancer must raise between
$100 and $250 to be in the mara-
thon. The participants must
dance all 24 hours to receive any
points.

There will be several live
bands, including the Affordable
Floors, the Sponges and 1 1th
Hour, and also a comedian.

”That’s been the big change
this year," said dance co-
chairperson Bill Breitenbach.
”The fact that we’ve brought in
a lot more live entertainment will
hopefully make the marathon a
lot more fun.”

The Dance Marathon hopes to
bring in $35,000 alone.

After the marathon is the Chari-
ot Race on Monday. There will
be three heats of two chariots
each. Each chariot is a group of
five fraternities and sororities. It
will be run on Biglow Boulevard
in between Fifth and Forbes

Cryonic freezing can
possibly prolong life

Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

”I believe we should just say
no to death and aging,” said
Berkeley cryobiologist Dr.
Paul Segal, a guest lecturer
sponsored by the Engineering
Student Cabinet, last night in
the Benedum Auditorium.

Segal stressed man's ability
to delay the aging process sig-
nificantly by using new ad-
vances in the sciences of
cloning, cryonics and
dietetics.

”What we are discussing
here is hard science, not
science fiction. In the new
millennium, we will set out to
conquer death, and with it,
time,” Segal told a large au-
dience.

Segal explained that he and
several other researchers in
California have postulated that
aging is a process that takes
place primarily in the brain.

Through his experimentation
with rats, Segal concluded that
aging can be delayed by feed-
ing the rat a diet deficient in
the amino acid tryptophan.

Segal cites the potential
medical benefits and advances
in transplant technology as the
main reason for scientists to
continue their controversial
research in cloning human be
ings. Segal said that currently,
patients who are in dire need
of an organ transplant could
be dehydrated and frozen
while the search for an organ
continued.

Segal compared the criti-
cism of genetic science with
the reservations many felt
about the flight of the Wright
Brothers’ first airplane.

”l think this will come be-
cause there are great forces
that are propelling these dis-
(overies to the scientific fore-
front," said Segal.

- No joke: To smoke,
or not to smoke?

The pending implementation of the university's smoking poli-
cy may be a positive step toward making the academic environ-
ment more healthy, but it must also be seen as a move that
restricts the freedoms of many students, faculty and staff mem-
bers at Pitt.

Smoking has been proven unhealthy, and in many cases, pas-
sive smokers -- those who have been exposed to ”second-
hand” smoke — claim unhealthy results. Unfortunately, enact-
ing and enforcing a policy that forces smokers to light up in
designated areas so as not to bother non-smokers is an unfair
measure.

Until now, if a non—smoker became annoyed with cigarette
smoke, that person was free to find somewhere else to breathe

, and work. After April I 1, students and faculty who smoke will

be evicted from a major part of the university's facilities

whenever they want, or need, a cigarette.

A person who smokes will no longer have the freedom to

exercise his desire to smoke when he wants to, and he will

be forced to find refuge in a predesignated section which may
not have the environment or materials necessary for him to carry
on with his business. In essence, non—smokers are telling smok-
ers that if they want to smoke, they are going to be punished

and sent to stand in an overcrowded corner.

In a nutshell 

The Catholic goes to church to speak about God. The
vodounist dances in the honfour to become God.

—— Haitian folk saying

Somebody has got to do it

When I was a kid, it was only
the good guys against the bad
guys.

After school, several of my fel-
low fourth-graders and I would
gather at someone’s house, split
up into teams of Russians and
Americans and then hunt each
other down between bushes,
back yards and driveways on the
block.

All of us wanted to be the
American good guys so we
flipped coins for ideology.

We were fearless in our pursuit
of the enemy, killed each other
with waterguns and died
gloriously.

The Americans always won -
it just seemed to be understood
between us. The only advantage
of being a Russian was having the
opportunity to try new and more
spectacular stunts of dying.

Now and then we would suffer
bloody noses, scraped knees and
bruised arms. But the injuries just
made the game more exciting.

MARC
DUCHIN

When dinner time rolled
around and the game was over,
it seemed certain we would all
grow up and become genuine
spies some day.

Now that I'm in college and
aware of many other job oppor-
tunities, being a spy isn't as ap-
pealing as it once was.

Many other students across the
nation seem to feel the same way,
as they are protesting CIA recruit-
ment on campus.

The morality and behavior of
the CIA is questionable in respect
to international laws and equal
rights. Students who actively
speak out against discrimination
and criminal activities should be
commended. Unfortunately, in
reality, determining what is right
and wrong isn't that simple.

He finds disillusionment and not m

I reluctantly took the first step
in becoming a ”responsible
citizen” two Fridays ago. While
I was visiting the rural, economi-
cally depressed place I call my
hometown, I went to the post
office and registered to vote.

Now I know that you patriots
out there would remind me that
voting is a great privilege in our
land of ”liberty and justice for
all.” There will be those who will
say that I am taking my privilege
to participate in ”democratic"
government too lightly — thumb-
ing my nose at the dead of the
past two world wars and Viet-
nam. However, this is not my in-
tent. ! am not ungrateful for the
life I live, nor do I wish to down-
play the sacrifices made by our
veterans when called upon to
serve this great nation.

My disillusionment lies beyond
the facade of political process
that blankets this land and is seen
by the rest of the world. I am dis-
gusted with the character of its
people.

Followers of evolutionist theory
tell us that man has lived on Earth
for millions of years. And in this

time, we as a species have ex-
panded our knowledge through
curiosity and creativity. We have
moved ourselves across the seas,
elevated our humble homes to
rival the mountains and have
taken on wings and soared to dis-
cover new worlds. Listen as
science sings its hymn to man:
”Creat is Man and greatly to be
praised!”

Despite our technology, we
have been less than successful in
finding men of character and
elevating them to positions of
authority to serve our best in-
terests. Again, this year, our selec-
tion of political leaders is bleak.
The nightly news never fails to
keep us up to date on the scan-
dals that disparage the reputa-
tions of those who, believe it or
not, claim they will be the best
at running this nation. I'm sorry,

but I have a hard time with this.-

I guess that the person on top
of my ”undeserving” list is Gary
Hart, and by looking at the vot-
ing results of ”Super Tuesday,” I
take it that many Americans feel
the same way. Here is a man who
has proven that he cannot even

 

 

ERIC KRIDLE

be faithful to his own wife. Hart
was a victim of his own short-
comings, and last week, he with-
drew for the second time from
the campaign.

Then there's Bush, who,
despite his continual downplay-
ing of his wimp image, came out
of the South whistling Dixie and
leading the Republican march to
the White House. This is the
same Bush who wrestled with
Dan Rather on national television
but refused to take Bob Dole up

on a debate before the Illinois
primary. Come on, George! Are
you afraid that the other boys on
the block will laugh at you?

Let's see. Now we have Pat
Robertson making accusations
that the revelation of Jimmy
Swaggart’s misconduct was
manufactured by the Bush
machine to ”discredit" his
campaign.

Finally, there is Jesse Jackson,
who seems to feel the majority of
the American people are not in-
telligent enough to understand
some of the reasons behind the
problems we now face except by
pointing a self-righteous finger at
everyone but the poor and
minorities. If the ”message,” as
he said, is to be kept ”low
enough for the goats to get it,"
then we must divide America into
two groups: (1) The good,
monetarily deprived blue-collar
workers who have never hurt
anyone in their lives and are
constantly being taken advantage
of by (2) The evil, bloodthirsty
"rich.” Jesse, let's talk reality.

I could go on, but it is unneces-
sary. This nation needs leaders of

The CIA never claimed to be a
church. It is a tool of government
to assure national security. Moral-
ity and security in our society
often clash with one another.
When dealing with foreign af-
fairs, circumstances arise in
which the best‘ action for the
United States to take may not be
the most moral one.

The CIA recruits just like any
other business, and as with every
business, it is designed for its own
personal gain.

In an interview with The Daily
Targum, CIA recruiter Jim Fitzger-
ald said, ”We live in a very small
world, a world that's full of tur-
moil and terrorism. It would be
foolhardy of us not to be aware
of developments of other coun-
tries as they relate to our
country."

We're not kids anymore and
being a spy may not necessarily
mean being a good guy.

character to serve in its political
offices, and by what I read, see
and hear, I am beginning to
wonder if such souls exist. Where
are these men of integrity and sta-
ture? Give us someone who is
educated but humble. Someone
who truly understands people, is
kind to the poor and gentle to the
aged.

The common citizen, however,
cannot shirk his guilt and impose
it upon the rich and influential.
Niccolo Machiavelli told us cen-
turies ago the ”public morality”
has a direct effect upon the ”po-
Iitical morality of the ruler.” Our
cry for liberty has become a plea
for pleasure while our quest for
justice is now merely a search for
another discrimination against
who else but me, the center of
the universe.

So we shouldn't be surprised
when we learn of the greed, de-
ception and infidelities of those
men society sees as possessing
greatness.

Colonial anti-slavery bill found

By Ian Gehorsam
Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA —- A 300—year-
old anti-slavery document that
provoked storms of debate but
never won approval will be the
focus of a renewed call for justice
during a week of activities here.

The tricentennial will celebrate
the authors’ convictions, but will
also mourn the nation's failure to
end slavery for another 175 years,
said the event's coordinator, Wil-
liam Grassie.

Written in April of 1688 by four
German-born Quakers, the Ger-
mantown Anti-Slavery Protest
was one of the earliest recorded
calls for abolition in America.
The document was fiercely de-
bated during several Quaker
meetings in Philadelphia and in
nearby Burlington, N.l., but was
finally set aside.

Several congregants concluded
that the statement was ”so
weighty that we think it not ex-
pedient to meddle with it here,”
according to the Cermantown
Historical Society.

”lt wasn't well-received,” said
one of the anniversary organizers,
Robert Tatman. ”lt went up
through several levels of the
Quaker hierarchy and then was
bounced back to lower levels.
There was no real agreement
among them about how to ap-
proach the problem."

”Some who were slave owners

were aghast,” Grassie said.

The document, written by Fran-
cis Daniel Pastorius and three
others, asked hard questions of
people who had been buying
slaves since the founding of the
colony of Pennsylvania in 1682.

English Quaker merchants and
traders, including colony found-
er William Penn, had grown ac-
customed to the slave trade
conducted by English seamen,
and they considered slaves the
answer to the ‘labor shortage in
the New World.

But Pastorius and the other
German signers had not encoun-
tered slavery in Germany, and
they decried it in America,
challenging the Quakers to up-
hold Penn's ”Holy Experiment”
in freedom.

”Pray, What thing in the world
can be done worse towards us,
then if men should robb or steal
us away, sell us for slaves to
strange Countries, separating
housband[s] from their wifes and
children  ” the four settlers
wrote.

”There is a saying that we shall
do to all [people] like as we will
be done ourselves; making no
difference of what generation,
descent or colour they are.”

But the statement won little
support and slavery remained a
central part of colonial life.

”You could call it a failure,"
Crassie said of the document.

Even so, the protest helped fan

later -protests and ultimately
prompted Quakers to forbid slav-
ery among its members in 1776.
In 1780, Pennsylvania became
the first state to pass a law lead-
ing to a gradual abolition of slav-
ery within its borders, Grassie
said.

The anniversary program will
feature a parade and rally on
April 23 in the north Philadelphia
neighborhood of Germantown
where the protest was written. A
youth choir and community pot-
luck dinner will be held April 24,
followed by by a five-day youth
leadership training program for
100 teenagers.

Grassie said the week's activi-
ties are intended to underscore
the moral issues of the past and
those of today.

An essay contest, a lecture ser-
ies and an original play will be
capped by a reception sponsored
by Mayor Wilson Goode.

As part of the preparations, the
organizers have drafted a ”l988
Germantown Protest” that is be-
ing circulated as a petition.
”While human slavery has been
abolished in law,” the organizers
write, ”the callous disregard of
life persists today in the abundant
denial of basic human rights and
needs. Our Germantown fore-
bears would have us stand today
with the homeless, the hungry,
the unemployed and the neglect-
ed  ”

Senate Iegislates
rules for attendance

By Lawrence L. Knutson
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — The
Senate, struggling to make
legislating a more orderly af-
fair, put itself on a new work
schedule this year and tight-
ened up its procedures.

‘Under the new schedule,
the Senate works in Washing-
ton for three straight weeks
and then permits senators to
return to their home states for
a full week to attend to their
constituents.

The purpose of the change
was to disband the so—called
Tuesday—Thursday club,
named for the age-old practice
of many senators who left
Washington on Thursday
evenings and did not return
until the following Tuesdays.

Now when the Senate is
meeting, senators are expect-
ed to attend, Monday through

Friday, no exceptions.

Roll call votes, which often
were prolonged for an hour or
more while the Senate waited
for an absent member to arrive
from the airport or from a
meeting across town, were
limited to a strict 15 minutes
each, no exceptions.

And that caused the
problem.

The three Senate office
buildings are linked to the
Capitol by an underground
subway.

For years that subway has
routinely and efficiently served
two of those buildings -— the
Russell and the Dirksen.

But the tunnel which was
extended to the new Hart
Senate Office Building is far
longer, as is the trip to the
Capitol.

And the Hart Building con-
tains the offices of 50 of the
100 senators.

THE PITT NEWS

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Never before has the word
”seed” had so little meaning.

Not the traditional seed that
sowers have been generally
known to sow.

Or the hillbilly see’d, as in
”Willie Ester explained to me her
sit—chee-a-shen, and now I see’d
what she meant.”

This particular seed has to do
with the hoedown referred to as
the NCAA’s College Hoops
Spring Fastbreak Contest, with an
all-expense paid trip for four to
Kemper Arena in Kansas City,
Mo., as the grand prize.

In simpler terms, call it March
Madness.

In the history of the NCAAs,
never before has the overall dis-
tance between the tournament's
No. 1 seed (Temple Owls) and
the tournament's 64th seed (say,
Cornell or Lehigh) been shorter.
And as for the 62 participants
strewn in between, well, who
knows which will eventually
sprout up out of the pack?

The East Regional —— The na-
tion's top-ranked and top-seeded
team in the East, Temple (29-1),
could run into immediate trouble
with the winner of Friday's
Georgetown—LSU matchup. Tem-
ple has virtually no bench

Kansas City could be
determining factor in
Lane's future at Pitt

For the second consecutive
year, the Pitt basketball team has
made it to the 64—team NCAA
Tournament. Expectations run
high for the Panthers, seeded sec-
ond in the Midwest Regional.

And why shouldn't they? Pitt
finished the season 23-6, winning
the Big East regular-season title

 

MATT
MARTIN

and finishing eighth in the As-
sociated Press national poll.

But on a closer look, maybe Pitt
fans shouldn't be so optimistic
about their team's chances to win
the national title.

The Panthers are coming off a
season—souring 72-69 loss to Vil-
lanova in the semifinal round of
the Big East Tournament and
have lost three of their past seven
games, including two losses to
Seton Hall within nine days.

The Panthers have not been
playing the basketball they're
capable of, getting out-
rebounded in all but three of their
past nine games.

Foul trouble has also plagued
Pitt, evidenced by reserve center
Steve Maslek’s appearance in the
game against the Wildcats when
Charles Smith and Bobby Martin
were on the bench with four fouls
each.

So why are the Panthers ranked
where they are? Of course,
they've been playing good
basketball all year long, always

staying in the Top 10 in the polls.
But most of all, it's because they
won when it counted - an 85-84
victory over Syracuse March 6 in
the Carrier Dome that ensured
them their first ever Big East
championship, as well as victo-
ries over nationally ranked teams
like Florida and Georgetown
earlier this year.

The driving force behind the
victory over Syracuse was Jerome
Lane, who had a career-high 29
points, as well as 15 rebounds.
But Jerome has not been quite so
crowd—pleasing in the games
since. Despite being named to
the Big East All-Tournament
Team, it was Lane who allowed
Villanova’s Mark Plansky to hit
the deciding three-pointer in the
Pitt loss last Saturday.

You have to give Lane his due.
He was named second—team All-
American and second—team All-
Big East this week.

But it was never more apparent
than on Lane's botched defensive
play that Lane expects to be given
his due. Lane did what he
thought he should do, despite
direct orders from coach Paul
Evans not to double down on Vil-
lanova center Tom Greis.

It has also never been more ap
parent than this season that when
Jerome Lane comes to play, Pitt
wins. And that could be the
difference in this year's national
tourney.

Lane has slipped out more than
one clue that he will go pro after
this year. First, he said that if Pitt

did the gymnasts win, they also
broke four school records.

The Lady Panthers scored a to-
tal of 184.65 points which easily
defeated Kent State's total of
177.85. It broke the Pitt record of
183.85 set in 1986.

Late—season comer Indiana

ably due to the team's recent

Junior Jerome Lane might be thinking about passing up his last year as a Panther for the NBA.

The Lady Panthers scored
46.55 points on vaulting, and
broke their first record of the
evening.(46.25-1984)

Pitt also took the top three
places in the vaulting, event. Co-
captains Kim Calderone (9.5) and
Leann Vaughn (9.4), along with
Trish Aser (9.3) all achieved their
highest scores of the season.

The gymnasts were on a roll as
they moved to the uneven
parallel bars where senior Cathy

Coleman and freshman Jeannie
Vecchio tied for the win with a
score of 9.4. Freshman Robyn
Borchers placed third on the un-
evens with a 9.1.

On their third event, the

coaches seemed overwhelmed

Gymnasts finish third in Great Lakes meet ,

By Sharon Haney

Staff Writer

The Pitt inen’s gymnastics team
hosted two meets at Trees llall
over spring break.

The first was held on Saturday,
March 5. Pitt hosted the Great
Lakes Championships which held
preliminaries for teams and finals
for top individuals. Kent State
finished first, scoring a 266.45.
William and Mary was second,
scoring 2.58.25. Pitt took third
with a 251.65. Eastern Michigan
finished fourth scoring a 215.7,
and Radford was fifth, receiving
a 167.7.

Jorge Gonzalez, one of Pitt's
top all—arounder.s, only competed
in two of the six events because
of a strained muscle in his shoul-
der, so Pitt sent only five of the
six gymnasts allowed to some of
the events.

()n the floor exercise, the top
Pitt gymnasts were Pat Pollaci
scoring a 9.()5, Steve Powanda
scoring an 8.75 and Keith Barsky
and Don Bullard, each scoring an
8.7.

()n the pommel horse, (ion/a-
le/ set a new (ireat lakes record,
receiving a 9.65. Next for Pitt was
Pollaci with an 8.7 and Todd Pro-
beck with a 7.65.

(‘)n the rings, the top Panthers
were Pollaci, scoring a 9.0, and
David llasselbrook and Dan
Tarosky, both scoring an 8.55.

The top vaulters for Pitt were
Gonzalez. (9.15), Powanda (9.1)
and Chris ()'l.oughlin and Polla-
ci, both with a 9.0.

()n the parallel bars, Pollaci,
Powanda and Tarosky were the
top Panthers, receiving scores of
8.8, 8.75, and 8.45 respectively.

The top Pitt gymnasts on the
high bar were Powanda with an
8.6 and Bullard and Hasselbrook,
each with an 8.55.

Pollaci finished third in the all-
around competition, scoring a
52.4.

Head coach Frank D’/\mico
said, ”We did as good as we
could with what we have. We
don't have much backing, so
when one of our guys gets hurt,
sometimes we're short a man.
With our many injuries, we're

just trying to hold on; we c an’t I)e
aggressive. ()ur best team isn't
out there."

/\bout scoring .1 new record
and a personal best on the porn-
mel horse, Gonzalez said, "I
went up there with a slightly
different attitude. I tried to relax
and just swing my routine. If I
keep it going, hopefully I'll have
the same results."

”The absence of Jorge seemed
to change the face of the meet.
We would've made a better run
for second place if Jorge was
healthy. But on the bright side,
we made the most out of what we
had today,” said Tarosky.

’’I think we did OK. We had
some major breaks. Since it's the
end of the season, we're a little
laid back and a little tired. But
overall, the guys did well," said
()'Loughlin.

In the finals, 1() gymnasts com~
peted, at least one from each
school, with the top six receiving
ribbons. On the floor exercise,
Pollaci took second, scoring a
9.3. On the pommel horse, Gon-
zalez once again received a 9.65

and took first place. Pollaci
finished third with an 8.8.

The still rings had three l’an~
thers competing, with Tarosky
taking third, scoring 9.15.
Tarosky was the defending ring-
score champion for the (ireat
I akes. last year he won the event
with a score of 9.()5.

(ionzalez was first on the vault,
scoring a 9.3. Powanda was in a
three—way tie for second place
with a 9.1.

On the parallel bars, Powanda
tied for third place with a score
of 9.1, and Pollaci took fifth place
with a score of 9.05.

Bullard and Hasselbrook took
fourth and fifth on the high bar
receiving scores of 8.8 and 8.65,
respectively.

"Anytime you can improve
your score, it's a step in the right
direction," said Tarosky.

”We have a young team, and
we're making improvements
every meet. We're not blessed
with healthy bodies in the gym,
but there's a fantastic attitude. We
have an optimistic future," he
added.

Panthers finished 8-6 overall.

"I didn't think we (lid poorly.

for him. "My goal was a 54, but
any time you hit a personal best,
you can't be displeased. That

Continued from page 9
wins the championship, he
would undoubtedly forego his
senior year of eligibility since
there would be nothing more for
him to accomplish in college.

And this past weekend, Lane
said, however subliminally, that
he would probably seek the hard-
ship clause in this year's NBA’s
draft.

Lane, who lives with his grand-
mother in Akron, Ohio, said that
she had done enough for him and
it was time for her to get some-
thing in return. Shades of Craig
Heyward!

Of course, nothing Lane says
can be taken as gospel, but if re-
cent spats with Evans, such as
Lane's snapping a towel at Evans
in the Villanova game, are any in—
dication, Lane may be playing his
last games with Pitt in the tour-
nament.

Lane was also quoted in the
Pittsburgh Press this past Sunday
as saying, ’’It don't matter what
he [Evans] says to me. What he
says just goes over my head.”

How will we know for sure if
Lane is leaving?

We won't until Lane officially
announces or denies his sup-
posed departure. But a good
predictor could be his play in the
NCAAs.

Lane has always said he has
trouble getting revved up for the
lesser teams on Pitt's schedule.
With Eastern Michigan of the
Mid—American Conference as
Pitt's first-round foe this Friday in
Lincoln, Neb., Lane may well
prove himself a hypocrite, at least
for a game.

If Lane is serious about taking
his one—man rebounding show to
the pro circus, he more than like-
ly will jump his game a notch or
two — not necessarily for Pitt's
sake, but more so to improve his
position in the draft.

Of course, it can only help the
Panthers if he does so. Pitt's in-
side game is the key to the team's
advancing in post-season play.

Unfortunately for Pitt, it is also
Lane's door to the pro ranks.
Keep an eye on him.

National League West could be
a wide open race for pennant

The following column is an
analysis of the National League
West Division.

The National League West
could be the only division that
has a pennant race this season. At
least three teams, with the possi-
bility of a fourth, have the neces-
sary horses to take the crown.

Right now, the Cincinnati Reds
appear to be the frontrunners.
Eric Davis is one of the most ex-
citing young talents in the game
today. First—baseman Nick Esasky
blossomed into a good hitter the
last month of the season. And, of
course, they have the season-
worn Dave Concepcion to give a

solid backup at practically any‘

position.

Through the trade route, the
Reds have been able to pick up
two of the best left-handers in the
game, Dennis Rasmussen and
Danny Jackson.

Jackson was a dominating 9-18
with Kansas City last season. The
numbers may not look that good,
but in his 18 losses, the power-
less Royals lineup gave him just

VINCE
CAREY

a little over two runs per game.

The bullpen is solid enough to
win a division title with the hard-
throwing John Franco (32 saves
last season) as a stopper.

If they can pick up one more
quality starting pitcher, and if
owner Marge Schott lets Pete
Rose manage the club the way it
should be managed, the Reds will
be facing the Mets in the league
championship game.

The Houston Astros could be
the best overall team in the divi-
sion; the only problem is that
they play in the Astrodome.

Their pitching staff is almost as
good as the Mets’. Nolan Ryan,
still throwing fire at 40, is as con-
sistent as they come. Give him
some runs to work with and Ryan
will win at least 20 games.

After Ryan is former Cy Young
award-winner and bal|—scuffer,
Mike Scott. Sometimes his

pitches are just plain unhittable.
If the game is tight in the ninth,
reliever Dave Smith comes trot-
ting out. Not only is he unhitta-
ble, but he doesn’t lose.

It's just that the Astrodome is
not conducive to hitters. First-
baseman Glenn Davis is one of
the premier power—hitters in the
National League. It's just a shame
that he has to play in Houston.

The Los Angeles Dodgers
could be the surprise team of the
season. They have what it takes
to get past the West.

The acquisition of Kurt Gibson
was one of the best moves that
the Dodgers have made in recent
years. Sure, he's another of those
American League sluggers who
hasn't faced National League
pitching, but he's good enough to
overcome this lack of experience.
Plus, the fans in L.A. won't jump
all over him for any kind of bad
start. He will thrive in the
southern California sun.

After Gibson, the Dodgers have
as much power in their lineup as
anyone. Mike Marshall will be

Tri-captains are important to Hockey Club

By John Labriola

Staff Writer

The Panther Hockey Club has
a long-standing tradition of
choosing three captains for their
team. The first captain is chosen

‘as the leader of the team, while

his assistant captains represent
both the offense and the defense.

During the game, most of the
on-ice decisions come from these
three players.

This past year, coach Jeff Bele
named Brian Owens captain and
Todd Raible and Greg Rich as his
two assistant captains.

Brian Owens is a junior from
Monroeville, where he played
hockey for three years. He is
working toward a double major
in business and economics. The

5-foot-1 1, I80-pound center has
been playing for Pitt for three
years.

”Last year, I played a partial
year because of a shoulder
injury.”

Owens’ injury has not affected
his performance this year. He is
tied with Marc Bowers for the po-
sition of top scorer for the Pan-
thers. He led the team in assists
(24), but he also had the most
penalty minutes (89).

Before every game, Owens
performs a few rituals that are real
eye-catchers. ”Before I play, my
shirt has to be tucked in all of the
way around me.

”My stick has to be taped com-
pletely from heel to toe. I can't
play without having this done,”
he said.

Owens also wears a pair of
blue and gold oversocks which
do not match. He also does not
wear any socks inside of his
skates.

”I don't wear any socks in my
skates because when I was in
eighth grade, I heard that Phil Es-
posito didn't wear them, so I
stopped wearing them.”

Assistant Todd Raible is a
senior from the North Hills,
where he played for two years.
He is also working toward a dou-
ble major in business and com-
puter science. The 5-7,
I40-pound center has been play-
ing for Pitt for four years.

Unlike Owens, Raible isn't
very superstitious. ”I don't really
believe in superstitions. When
something happens, I just don't
do it again," Raible commented.

’’I have to agree with Todd,”
said Greg Rich, the other assistant
captain.

”Superstitions aren't really that
big. They are Brian's life,
though.”

Rich is a senior from Shaler,
where he played for three years
The 6-1, 200-pound defenseman
has been playing for Pitt for three
years and is majoring in commu-
nications.

The Panthers challenge teams
that are not in their league so that
they can gain more experience.

”When we play teams like Cin-
cinnati and Penn State [main
campus], we know that there is
a good chance that we might get
clobbered. But, it gives us a
chance to gain the experience of
playing against a team that is bet-

ter than us. In the long run, it
helps us to become a better
team,” said Raible.

’_ ‘When we went to Penn State,
it was more for the ice time than
for the experience," added
Owens.

As a result of the tension and
frustrations that build up during
a hockey game, fights often oc-
cur. ”I feel that fights are a large
part of the game, but they aren't
the best part of the game,” stat-
ed Raible.

’’l have to agree that fights are
a part of the game, but I don't feel
that they are needed in amateur
sports. The fights detract from the
momentum of the game,” said
Owens.

”|t’s more or less defense.
Either you hit someone or you get
hit,” stated Rich.

STUDENTS

To retain or select a room for the Fall Term 1988, please remember
the following dates and times:

Kentucky, winner of the SEC, has
played more like Mildcats, not
Wildcats, in recent NCAA tourna-
ments, but at 22-5, this Eddie Sut-
ton team seems to have peaked
at the right time. Should be in-
teresting to see what UC-Santa
Barbara can do after putting on a
pretty good show in the much-
improved PCAA. Illinois, for once
not a regional favorite, could col-
lect a few scalps while the other
teams aren't looking.

Who's headed to Kemper from
the Southeast? Oklahoma. The
Sooners have more muscle inside
than anyone, and probably the
bracket’s best point guard in
Ricky Grace. This isn't coach Bil-
ly Tubbs’ best Oklahoma team,
but it'll do just fine this year.

The West Regional — Arizona,
North Carolina, Michigan,
Wyoming, UNLV, Iowa -— initial-
ly, it seems like the NCAA tried
to put all of its golden eggs in one
basket with these pairings. Arizo-
na's Wildcats (3l—2), the region's
top seed, have flirted with the
polls’ No. I ranking all season,
but competing in the weak
Pac-10 didn't make this team as
tawdry as it could be. 1980 was
the last time a Pac-l0er — hap-
pened to be UCLA -- made it all
the way to the Final Four. So it
could be pretty safe to go ahead
and kiss Arizona good-bye. The
Tarheels are talented and have
been Top 10 material all season,
but are still so, so young. The
’Hee|s will need another year of
maturity before their day comes
again. Michigan or Wyoming,
without question, have what it
takes in terms of talent. But heart
and poise under pressure? That's

Third Miller makes hoops a family affair

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

Before he won fame as Pitt's in-
telligent young point guard, Sean
Miller turned down a mini-
fortune he could have made per-
forming his sleight-of-hand ball-
handling wizardry around the
world.

" Well, don't look now, but the

John Miller family of Beaver Falls,
Pa., is up to its old tricks. '

He's only 9- years-old and a
third grader, but Ryan ”Archie”
Miller, Sean's younger brother, is
getting into the act -—- literally.

Now that Sean has quit per-
forming his one-man basketball
show to concentrate on running
the show for eighth-ranked Pitt,
his little brother is learning the
tricks of the trade.

And, before long, Ryan Miller

’ just might find himself spinning

seven balls at the same time on
The Tonight Show with johnny
Carson, just as big brother did as
a 13-year-old in 1983.

”Where Sean would take the
time when he was young to do

all of the drills, Archie would
rather play. He plays all the
time,” said John Miller, the
basketball coach at Blackhawk
High School in Beaver Falls.

’’I can't tell yet if he's going to
get into it the same way Sean did,
but he's the same age Sean was
when he started, and they're pret-
ty comparable.”

The only difference between
the two brothers, Dad Miller said,
is, ”Ryan is growing up different;
he's in the middle of all the hoop-
la. He's in the middle of all the
craziness” generated by Sean's
success.

Between his pee-wee team's
games, watching big brother play
for a nationally ranked team, his
father's high school games and
his own performances with Pitt's
ballhandling troupe, the Little
Panthers, one might think Ryan
Miller would quickly burn out on
basketball.

”Naw, he loves it,” Sean said.
”He probably likes to play even
more than I did. I just got into the
drills a little more than he does.”

John Miller said that with Ar-

Freshman Kathy Wallish at-
tained her highest season score
with a 9.45 and won the event.
Aser finished second with a 9.4,
and Shelly Sleith placed third
with a 9.25.

The last home meet will be this
Friday, March 18 when Pitt hosts
Bowling Green at Trees Hall. The
meet starts at 7pm. This will be
the final home meet for seniors
Kim Calderone, Cathy Coleman,
and Leann Vaughn.

Miller dislikes the nickname --
he has been careful not to push
too much basketball too soon.
”We want everything to be fun,
and if it looks like I'm pushing,
I back off,” he said. ”With Sean,
you never had to worry about
pushing him because he always
did so much for himself.”
When college coaches used to
watch a diminutive Sean Miller
perform his ballhandling and
trick dribbling stunts at college
and pro games, coaching clinics
and camps, they'd smile and say,
”Yeah, nice, but can he play?”
But once the 6-foot Sean began
to grow —- he's gained nearly four
inches in the last two years — his
father was certain that the count-

behind-the-back dribbling and
playground games would pay off.

They did on Monday when
Sean, after averaging 10 points
and seven assists a game in his
rookie season, was named the
Big East Conference freshman of
the year.

’’I’m just happy he's been re-
warded for his hard work for 10
years,” his father said. ”He’s
worked so extra hard all his life
 in the summers, he used to live
on the outdoor courts. He didn't
grow up in a big city, but he al-
ways played like a city kid; he'd
stay on the playgrounds for
hours.

”He’s worked the summer
camps all his life; he played at all
the big camps. He was always
right in the middle of it. It paid

It almost paid off a few years
ago, in dollars and cents, when
Sean had to turn down an esti-
mated $100,000 in shoe compa-
ny endorsement offers and
commercials to remain eligible
for a college scholarship.

And now, it could be Miller
time again.

”We’re not sure yet, but [Ryan]
may perform the halftime show at
the Dapper Dan [prep all-star
game in Pittsburgh],” John Miller
said. ’’I don't know how far it's
going to go with him, if he's go-
ing to get into it the way Sean did.

”But he seems to love basket-
ball the way Sean did. We'll just
have to wait and see.”

Wrestling team sends
four to NCAA Tourney
after EWL victories

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Panther wrestling team
finished fourth in last weekend's
Eastern Wrestling League Tourna-
ment. ln the process, four wres-
tlers qualified for the NCAA
Championships this Thursday
through Saturday.

”[The EWL] this year was the
toughest during the regular sea-
son, and the tournament was no
exception,” Pitt coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. ”Everyone who
competed was very, very good. It
was real exciting.”

Pitt's Alan Utter pulled the sur-
prise of the tourney. Utter came
in as an unseeded 134-pounder,
and came away with the cham-
pionship.

Before the tournament, Stottle-
myer predicted that Utter would
win. He is the first unseeded
wrestler to win the tournament in
the 12 years that it has been held.

”Alan did a real bang~up job,”
Stottlemyer said. ”lt was the best
string of matches that he has put
together all year. He wrestled
really tough. Alan believed in
himself; he knew that he was ev-
ery bit as good as the rest of them.
I was really proud.”

All-American and undefeated
(43-0) Pat Santoro breezed
through the tournament to take
the championship.

”Pat looked outstanding
again,” Stottlemyer said. "He just
goes in and gets the job done. 1
really don’t think that anybody
can beat him.”

Freshman Scott Hovan rolled
through the tournament, until it
was time for the championship
match.

No.1 seed Dave Morgan
stopped him. Hovan finished se-
cond, but he still qualified for the
NCAAs

”Scott wrestled good, just not
too smart,” Stottlemyer said. ”He
always comes out fast but some-
times gets caught up in too many
things besides the match. He
looked like he could win it, then
came the championship. But, for
a freshman to finish as high as
second is still very good.”

At 158 pounds, Jeff Turner was
the last Panther to qualify. He
started slowly but was able to fin-
ish third in the tournament.

”Jeff is a good wrestler,”
Stottlemyer said. ”He was able to
beat guys this time around who
have beaten him before. He beat
a guy from Clarion 2-O, came
away with a 2-0 win against the
Lock Haven man, so he did a

good job.

”He also came in unseeded
and pulled off the third place. Jeff
wrestled what I would call a
smart tourney. He just did what
was needed and didn't get too
fancy.”

Penn State won the team cham-
pionship, followed by Lock
Haven, Bloomsburg, Pitt, West
Virginia, Cleveland State and
Clarion. The Panthers finished
7‘/2 points out of second place.

”Our guys showed everybody
that Pitt is a tough team,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”We had a few un-
believable performances with a
lineup that wasn't the same as
what we started the year with.

”l think that if Mike Tongel [an-
kle injury] had been able to com-
pete, we would have been a solid
second place. Plus, some of the
breaks didn't go our way. 1
though that we would be able to
score points at 167 and 177, but
we didn't. I thought we could
take a fourth place at
heavyweight, but we didn't.
Everybody wrestled up to their
potential, and we earned that
respect.”

The NCAAS are being held in
Ames, Iowa, this year. The finals
are being broadcast live on ESPN,
Saturday at 9 p.m.

moved to first base, which should
give his fragile knees a rest. Pedro
Guerrero is going to be tried as
a third baseman again. He has
failed there before, but now
Guerrero says that he is going to
dedicate himself to the part. If he
does that, it could be another
Comeback-Player-of-the-Year
award in his trophy case.

The newly acquired Mike Da-
vis and Alfredo Griffin give
speed. Second baseman Steve
Sax is consistent, and John Shel-
by is a very underrated outfielder.

Pitching is a little thin, with
Orel Hershiser and Fernando
Valenzuela as the only proven
starters and Jesse Orosco (ac-
quired from the Mets) a good left-
handed reliever. Wasn't there a
team last year that won with only
two quality starters, one quality
reliever and a powerful lineup?

The San Francisco Giants will
have a tough time repeating this
season.

Sure, they have the horses in
the lineup and their pitching is
above par, but there are too many
things going on in the organi-
zation.

Take into account that the
ownership is always grumbling
about moving out of Candlestick
Park and how no team can repeat
nowadays, and you have a tough

season in front of you. Those one-
flap-down fans could be chanting
”huh-baby!” at playoff time this
yeah

Who was one of the best teams
after the all-star break last season?

Well, the San Diego Padres,
that's who.

They are led by the colorful
(mostly an angry red) Larry Bowa
on the bench and the very con-
sistent Tony Gwynn in the field.
Gwynn will hit over .320 every
year. Chris Brown was a bust
with the Giants but has all of the
potential. Benito Santiago was
Rookie of the Year and one of the
best catchers in the game.

The pitching is downright
lousy, which will hold them
back. The loss of reliever Rich
”Goose” Gossage to the Cubs
won't help matters. But the
Padres’ youth will be able to stay
with people through the long
haul.

The saddest team in baseball
this year might be the Atlanta
Braves.

Chuck Tanner is too soft and
too old to get his team motivated
anymore. Dale Murphy is a liv-
ing legend and is the only one
worth going to see.

Their best battery is Zane
(Smith) to Ozzie (Virgil). This isn't
really a team; it's more like an
SCTV skit.

Arizona hopes history

won't repeat itself in
this year's NCAA field

By Arthur H. Rotstein

Associated Press Writer

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Each of
the last three years, Arizona has
danced the NCAA Tournament’s
one-step shuffle. A quick loss,
and out the door.

This time, the No. 2-ranked
Wildcats, 31-2 and top seeded in
the West Regional, are looking to
win the dance marathon while
doubling as a doorman and
ushering other guests home.

”We’re excited, I think, that the
time is here,” Coach Lute Olson
said Tuesday, ”and it could not
come at a better time. We're
playing the best we've played all
year long.

’’If you don't think you can win
it, you shouldn't be there, and
you won't win it if you don't
think you will."

He said his staff and players ar-

en't concerned about the strength
of the West Regional field, which
includes seven teams ranked in
the Top Twenty. /

”We’re not worried about any-
thing, and that's not to say we
don’t respect everybody we play,
because I think we do,” Olson
said. ”But respect and fear, I
think, are two different things.”

A year ago, the Wildcats were

18-12, making the West field as‘

the 10th seed. This season's vete-
rans readily admit they were
awed, fearful or outmanned the
first few or three times they
played in the NCAA Tournament.

They say that's not the case
now, coming as they are off a
regular season season in which
they won three tournaments, in-
cluding the Great Alaska
Shootout and the Fiesta Classic in
which they beat Michigan, Syra-
cuse and Duke.
