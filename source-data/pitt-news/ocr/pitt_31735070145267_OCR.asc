Raptors multiply on Pitt campus

Pittsburgh awaits the birth of chicks to the peregrine falcons who live atop the Cathedral.

Olivia Garber
For The Pitt News

The Cathedral of Learning is many

' things —— a symbol of higher educa-
tion, a quiet study area surrounded by
Gothic Revival architecture and, quite
literally, a lovers’ nest. ‘

Dorothy, an 11-year-old peregrine
falcon, and her partner, E2, have nested
at the very top the Cathedral of Leam-
ing since 2002. Dorothy recently laid
three eggs — thethirdjusttwo nights
ago — in the sandy nest, which is be-
ing monitored by the National Aviary
inPit1;sburgh. ’

Kate St.John, avolunteerwho moni-
tors the pair of peregrine falcons, calls
the building “the Taj Mahal for fal-
cons.” ‘

“The Cathedral of Learning is fan-
tastic’. It’s a gorgeous building, [with a]
good view, and the nearest nest is far
away, so there’s no competition,” said St.
John, whohasbeen monitoringfalcons
since 2001.

Because peregrine falcons nest on
cliffswith sand and gravel, the Cathedral

plenty of songbirds for food,” Brann-
ingsaid.

The nest at Pitt has produced 29
ﬂedglings since 2002, but Dorothy
ﬂew to Pittsburgh from Wisconsin in
2001, according to the National Avi-

, arywebsite.

Dorothy—whowas named aftera

' parking lot attendant who monitored

falcons — hatched in Wisconsin in
1999. When she was about a year old,
Dorothy ﬂew to Pittsburgh. Because
Dorothy had been handed after she
hatched, the Naﬁonal Aviary was able
to ﬁnd out from where she had ﬂown.
Dorothy’s long journey is consistent
with the nomadic tendencies of per-
egrine falcons.

“Peregrines wander. They don’t
migrate. They go every which way,” St.
John said. .

In 2002, Dorothy ﬁrst nested in
Pittsburgh with her mate, Erie, who
was identiﬁed from his band as com-
ing from Columbus, Ohio. Erie, who
made national news for ﬁghting and
killing a competing male falcon from
Cleveland, mysteriously disappeared
in October 2007.

Erin Estell, assistant director of
Animal Programs at the National Avi-
ary, saidthereareanumber of different
scenarios explainingthe disappearance
of Erie. E2 (short for Erie 2) could have
fought oﬂErie, or Erie could have died,

Pitt gymnastics team fresh-

her window to see something
that, in her hometown of Chi-

“When we came here, there ,
was a whole lot of traffic but
people moved over right away
instead of cutting us off,” Biros

Biros was a senior in high

Pitt for the ﬁrst time. That trek

New trustee to focus on campus ﬁnances

Eva Bugos
For The Pitt News

Thomas VanKirk, a local law-
yer, has been appointed to the
Pitt Board of Trustees.

Keith McCall, the speaker of
Pennsylvania’s House of Repre-
sentatives, appointed VanKirk
to the position, the Pitt Board
of Trustees Chairman Stephen
Tritch announced at the board’s
winter meeting last month.

The board of trustees has 36
voting members, 12 of whom are
appointed by the governor and by
members of the state Senate and
House of Representatives. The
rest of the board members are
elected by the board, some with
recommendations from the Pitt
Alumni Association.

VanKirk is currently chair and
previously was CEO of Buchanan
Ingersoll & Rooney PC, a Pitts-
burgh—based law ﬁrm. VanKirk is
a practicing litigator who focuses

on corporate takeovers and anti-
trust-counseling and litigation.
As a new board member,
VanKirk said he is concerned
with the fiscal policies and aca-
demic reputation of the school.
' “I am very interested in the
audit function, to make sure that
the university stays on what I be-
lieve is currently a very sound

‘ﬁscal track,” he said. “And I am

also interested in the academic
side, in seeing that the university
grows and is recognized as a lead-

ing academic institution.” 4
He has several civic and chari-
table leadership positions, ac-

cording to his page on his law V

firm’s website. He is on com-
mittees orvboards for several
organizations, including United
Way of Allegheny County and the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, as well
as the council of theiUniversity of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.
The University of Pittsburgh
Board of Trustees is ultimately
responsible for all University af-

fairs, according to the Pitt Staff .

Handbook.

The board delegates most au-
thority to the chancellor, but it
is directly responsible for selec-
tion of the chancellor, approval
of major University policies and
deﬁnition of University’s mission
and goals. ‘

The board meets three or
more times each year and carries
out its work in committees, many
of which include non‘-voting staff
and student members.

Census 2010: Coming to a mailbox near you

Oﬂicial explains how students should fill out the upcoming Census.

Eva Bugos
For The Pitt News

For many people in the United

States, ﬁlling out the address‘

line on the decennial U.S. Census
is fairly straightforward: They
live at one location.

But because college students
are a highly mobile group, they
are historically misrepresented
in the survey, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau website.

. Ben Ramos, partnership co-
ordinator at the Philadelphia
Regional Census.Center, at-
tempted to explain how students
will complete the census. '

The census, which is taken
every 10 years, aims to count
people “where they’re living
and they’re working and they’re
spending most of their time,”
he said.

That means college students
will complete the survey in the
following ways: ‘

 

   Arrival Survival Volunteers:

Join our team as an Arrival Su

Students living on campus

On—campus residence halls
and fraternities are cons_idered
group quarters. Students living
in group quarters are counted
during Group Quarters Enumer-
ation between April 1 and May
21. They ﬁll out an Individual
Census Report. ,

A Census Bureau employee
meets in advance with a member
of Student Affairs to discuss the
most effective method of dis-
tributing the census, accord-
ing to the U.S. Census Bureau’s
Census on Campus Initiative
website.

Pitt spokeswoman Patricia
White said she did not know last
night how Pitt planned to coor-
dinate with census workers.

Students living off campus

Students living in off—campus
housing, such as apartments or

houses, will receive a census
questionnaire in March. They
should ﬁll out the questionnaire
andvreturn it by April 1, which is
Census Day. The Census Bureau
is training people to go door to
door to collect census data from
households that do not return
the questionnaire by April 1.

Non-citizens

Since the U.S. Census counts
every person living in the United
States, citizens and non—citizens
alike should ﬁll out the form. In-
ternational students whose pri-
mary residence is in the United
States on April 1 should ﬁll out
the census, according to a U.S.
Census Bureau fact sheet.

/

Study-abroad students

According to the Census Bu— -

reau Website, if you are studying
abroad on April 1, 2Q10, you will
not be counted in the census.

If you are studying abroad for
part of the year, but are living in
the United States on April 1, you
should ﬁll out a census form.

Information to know about
the census

Ramos emphasized that the
information provided by indi-
viduals for the census is strictly
conﬁdential.

By law, the Census Bureau
cannot share individual re-
sponses with any agency, and
Census Bureau employees take
an oath and may be ﬁned and
sent to jail for disclosing conﬁ-
dential information, according
to a Census Bureau factsheet.

“The only information that
most of us read about or know
about the census is used for sta-
tistical purposes only,” Ramos
said. Statistical information is
used by individuals and busi-
nesses cam use the data to help
them understand the dynamics

marketing purposes. The results
of the census can affect govern-
ment officials’ decisions about
critical services, such as how to
fund transportation and public
health and safety. Government
student loans and public edu-
cation funds are also allocated
based on the population counts
obtained from the census.

Ramos also stressed that the
2010 Census questionnaire is
the shortest form in the history
of the census, since its incep-
tion in 1790. Population data
obtained from the census is used
to allocate funds and determine
political representation at the
federal, state and municipal
levels. ’

“So that’s why it’s important
to conduct a complete and full
count of every resident,” Ramos
said. “It has nothing to do with
immigration  The Constitu-
tion requires us to conduct a full
count of every individual living
in the U.S.”

for long. ’
“Dorothy doesn’t die of heart sickness. She

finds another mate,” Estell said.
E2,whowashatched atthe GulfTowerinPitts-

burgh, arrived on the scene in fall 2007, and in »

spring 2008, Dorothy began nesting with him.
Three eggs nestled on top of the Cathedral mark
the third time Dorothy andE2 have made a gener-
ous contribution to the peregrine population.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission and the
NationalAviaryband eyases, orbabyfalcons, when
they are around three to four weeks old. When
eyases arebanded depends on the size of the bird,
Estell said. The people in charge of banding the
eyases wait for the feet to be completely grown so
thatthe band does not get too tight orfall off.

While it is possible to track falcons through
the Pennsylvania Game Commission’s telemetry
researchstudy (available through the Pennsylvania
Game Comrnissionwebsite), the bands serveas an
identiﬁcation and research tool, Brauning said.

Because ofthe bands, two falcons who hatched
at the Cathedral have been located and identiﬁed
by falcon watchers in the area. A female hatched
in 2007was lastrecorded at her own nesting site
in Rochester, N.Y., lastyear. The second falcon, a
male hatchedin2008,was spottedlastDecember
in Tarentum, Pa., according to Brauning and the
National Aviary. ‘

The peregrine falcon was removed from the
nationallistof endangered species in1999, accord-
ingto the Environmental ProtectionAgency’sweb-
site, butperegrinefalcons remainaPennsylvania
Endangered Species. The banding of the falcons
hashelped monitorthebirds, andwhileitdoes not
directiycontributetothe repopulation ofperegrine
falcons, it does serve as atool, Brauning said. He

. also said the banning of DDT in 1972, a pesticide

used on crops and forest lands,was a prerequisite
to helping the falcons repopulate.

Now, Brauning says that the Pennsylvania
Game Commission helps protectperegrines from
human activity. Their numbers are sﬂll small, with
only 1700 breeding pairs in the U.S. and Canada,
according to the Pennsylvania Game Commis-
sion. Peregrine falcons can be found on all places
of the earth except Antarctica; in addition to the
Cathedral ofLearning, Pittsburgh has other nest-
inglocations at the GulfI‘owerinDowntown, East
Rochester—Monaca Bridge and 62nd Street Bridge,
according to the National Aviary website.

Although Dorothyzand E2 have been exposed
to humans sincebirth, St.Johnst1'essesthatthese

A birds are not pets.

“They do notlike people. Theywill attack any-
onewho messeswiththeirnest,”St.John said. “But,
theywill put up with people being aroun .”

While the urban environment does provide
certain amenities — like an unlimited supply of
pigeons to eat —- there are certain dangers in
Pittsburgh that don’t exist in a falcon’s natural
habitat.

One of the most common ways for falcons to
dieisto collidewithwindowpanes, Brauningsaid.
Injune 2008, aPit1sburghfalcon crashed into the
Rand Building and broke his neck, according to a
previous article in The Pitt News.

People canwatch live video of the famous lov-
ers ir1 their nest on The National Aviary’s website.
St. John writes about the peregrines in her blog,
Outside MyWmdow,whichis on the WQED web-
site. ‘

The typical mating season of peregrines lasts

fromlateMarchthroughMay,accordingtoDe—,

fenders of Wildlife. The average nest usually has
threeto four eggs, whichwill hatch afcerabout 30
days of gestation.

Pittsburgh could soon see another
drink tax — not on booze this
time, but on sugary drinks.
Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl announced his plan earlier
this week that would put a 2—cents-
per-ounce tax on sugary bever-
ages such as soda, energy drinks,
ﬂavored waters and sweetened
teas sold at restaurants, stores
and vending machines, accord-
ing to the Pittsburgh Post—Ga-

zette. Diet sodas and fruit juices

wouldn’t be taxed.

It’s not the sweetest of deals
for all — any new tax always
makes the citizenry cringe. Yet
compared to Ravenstahl’s and
others’ past proposed and instat-

»ed taxes, this tax is much more

Pittsburgh Pop Tax could make money, save lives

agreeable.

Joanna Doven, Ravenstahl’s
spokeswoman, told the Post—Ga-
zette that consumption statistics
compiled by Yale University proj-
ect that Pittsburgh could raise $25
million a year from the tax.

Ravenstahl has proposed more
than one egregiously unpopular
plan to raise money for the city
and help payoff Pittsburgh’s multi-
million dollar pension woes. His
tuition tax proposed near the end
of last year sought to levy a tax
on area college students equal
to one percent of their tuition.
Even for in-state Pitt students,
the tax would have amounted to
over $100. Local students, edu-
cators and administrators pro-

tested ﬁercely until Ravenstahl
ﬁnally —. and rightly — caved.
Ravenstahl has also mentioned
taxing typically tax- exempt non-
proﬁt groups — another heavily
criticized idea. ,

Pittsburghers were also served
with the Allegheny County Drink
Tax back in 2008 that originally
placed a 10 percent tax on poured
alcoholic beverages. Many citi-
zens, especially bar owners,
didn’t ﬁnd it fair and voiced
strongobjections.

A soda tax won’t leave soda-
holics feeling bubbly, and there’s
strong opposition from the Penn-
sylvania Beverage Association.
Opponents say it’ll only make

more expensive. But it’s still a
more universal tax compared to

the tuition tax or potential tax

on non-proﬁts. A tax on sugary
drinks isn’t a novel concept —
Philadelphia’s mayor is in the
midst of planning a potential
soda tax. New York state is also
considering a_soda tax. Perhaps
it’s a blossoming trend, but the
tax could have a beneﬁcial side
effect. _ '

' Soda might not be on the same
destructive level as alcohol and
cigarettes + both of which al-
ready have sin taxes affixed —-— but

. it’s been shown to contribute to

obesity and isn’t nearly as healthy
compared to more basic bever-

The Philadelphia Inquirer re-
ported that a study published in
the Archives of Internal Medi-
cine followed 5,000 soda-drink-
ing individuals for 20 years as
they moved across the country
and purchased soda at different
prices. A $1 increase in price of
a 2—liter bottle of soda resulted
in less consumption, the study
found. Speciﬁcally, the price raise
resulted in 124 fewer calories con-
sumed per day and 2.34 pounds
lower bodyweight per year. Now,

children also drink more soda

than milk.

For as much as we scoff at
taxes, such a tax seems the most
fair, and could even do some good
to our health.

Health care hoopla: Reconciliation a b*tch

Reconciliation weakens entrenched Democratic system.

Republicans ignoring the past. And the present.

Dave Beitzel
Columnist

 

Get readyto choke on it, GOP, because health care
reform is coming! You say it’s being “rammed
down the throa ” of Americans, but the recon-
ciliationtactic beingused is more like massaging
acat’s throat to get the pill down. ‘
Reconciliation is amundane procedure that
ties legislation to budgetary impact. It has the

ability to bypass the super majority of 60 votes .

needed in the Senate to break a ﬁlibuster.

If you’re not face down on the page by now,
here’s why the Democrats need to use it.

The Census Bureau estimated that there were
46 million uninsured Americans in2008. In the
past two years that number has balloonedas
high as 52 million by some estimates, probably
because of skyrocketing insurance rates and un-

' . employment.Pinkslips endinsurancecoverage

and suddenly that adult-onset diabetes becomes

l extort the rabble. Anthem Blue Cross raised its
rates by 39 percentbecause $500 million inprof—
its is apparently peasant money. The proposed
health care bill — including the reconciliation
bill —— would help about 30 million Americans
get coverage, make insurance more affordable,

end pre—existing condition discrimination, in-

crease competition in the marketplace, make
insurance plans portable from job to job and
actually decrease the national deﬁcit.

Yet Republicans have been stubborn. Presi-
dent Obama has tried negotiatingwith them on
health care, but if you listen to Rush Limbaugh,

you’cl think this bill reanimates Sta1in’s corpse to_

of the American
legislative system
that undermines the
spirit and history of our

Democratic system. To do so, they are ready
to use reconciliation, an arcane parliamentary
procedure ﬁrst implemented in 1974, designed
to be a seldom—used process that “changes
existing laws to conform with tax and spend-
ing levels set in a budget resolution.” It does
so by permitting the passage of elements with
a 51-vote majority, without the possibility of
ﬁlibuster.

It was not designed to be a stealth back-
door option to avoid a ﬁlibuster for sweeping
legislative changes, and it has never been used
as such.

But that’s exactly what Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid, D—Nev., has determined
to do. It’s precisely what our founding fathers
feared: In Federalist No. 10, James Madison
warned of the dangers of tyranny of the ma-

jority, noting that “measures are too often
decided, not according to the rules ofjustice
and the rights of the minor party, but by the

superior force of an interested and overbear— .

ing majority.”

And here we have the superior force of an
overbearing congressional majority pushing
for a bill that the American people broadly op-
pose (a recent Associated Press poll found that
68 percent of Americans want the Democrats
to work with Republicans instead of crafting a

progress is stymied because they’re apparently
just sitting around holding ticlde festivals.

Now the Republicans say, “The American
public wants to start over.” When? When Repub-
licans eventually get back the majority? They
were in power from 1996-2006. Health care
barely got a mention, but Republicans found
time to use reconciliation on a host of other
bills.

Republicans have actuallyused reconciliation
almosttvvice as much as Democrats — 14to 8 ac-
cordingto PolitiFact. They used it for the welfare
reform bill in 1996, forwhich, by the way, House
Minority Leaderjohn “Do I Kind of Remind You
of Snooki?” Boehner voted. Would Republicans
say that he “jammed through” welfare reform,
as he says about Obama and health care?

Republicans again used reconciliation in
2001 and 2003 to pass the famous Bush tax
cuts. The 2003 cuts passed ona51-50 vote, with
Darth Cheney risingfrom his cryptto break the
tie. And at $2.5 trillion, those tax cuts were more
than twice as costly as the House health care
proposal, according to a study by the Citizens

for Taxjustice. Conservatives can’t say a bill
of this magnitude has never gone through on
reconciliation before.

The whole thing reeks of intellectual dis-
honesty. .

Republicans hemmed and hawed and fed the
public lies —‘ death panels, illegal immigrant
coverage, etc. — until they plowed enoughpeo—
ple into believing the bill was a death sentence.
That’s why polls show a majority of Americans
hating “the bill” but loving all of its individual
components. They’ve beenﬂeeced by conserva-
tive opinion-makers.

T If the Republicans had any dignity or belief
in their own rhetoric, they’d explain the details
of the bill in town halls. They’d talk about the

components, which are wildly popular. They’d V

ask for ideas on improving it, because the bill
isn’t near perfect. 9 .

Instead, they just trot out the 2,400-page
document. They squeal and shriek about social-
ism. They brought out their caricauirizedversion
of the Founders, regurgitating their CliffsNotes
understanding of the Constitution. _

The ﬁlibuster isn’t in the Constitution. Nei-
ther is reconciliation. They’re both parliamen-
tary parlortricks —— neither ofwhich voters will

are in the minority, they’ll rage with the fury of
hell to stop Republican reconciliation bills.

The heart of either argument is majority
versus minority rights.

Conservatives say this reconciliation bill
tramples all over the rights of the minority. It
does trample all over Republicans, but they’re
not the minority here. V

The minority is 52 million uninsured Ameri-

‘ cans. They can’t afford health care, so they cer-

tainly can’t afford to lobby with the ferocity of

pharmaceutical and insurance corporations.
That’s the minority that needs to be protected

here, and this legislation starts doing that.

The charm of a show starring
ﬁve singing and dancing nuns is
not readily discernable. What is
clear, though, is that divine in-

show’s success over its long history

As “Nunsense” makes its de-

be able to discover what the fuss
is about.

Pittsburgh might not be geo-
graphically far from the show’s
birthplace in Manhattan, but 27
years of notoriety, countless pro-

ductions around the country and
six sequels set apart this 2010 pro-
duction from its origins.

Most musicals nowadays are
inspired by movies, books and
plays, but “Nunsense” holds the
distinction of being born from a
line of greeting cards. In the early
1980s, Goggin wrote a series of
cards featuring actress Marilyn Fa-
rina in the full nun’s habit. For the
sake of advertising the line, Goggin
wrote small scenes for Farina to
perform at press events. Eventu-
ally, these sketches inspired him
to create a whole musical for the
Mother Superior character.

The original run of the musical
“Nunsense Story” was scheduled
for four days, but popular demand
kept it playing in Manhattan for 38
weeks. What eventuallybecame
just “Nunsense” was ﬂeshed out

alities and a revamped score. The

ANALYSIS‘

‘Star-Spangled’ gets mangled in history

National anthem performers once arrested, now applauded for attaching bells and whistles to original song.

_ Kelsey Shea
Asst. A8-E Editor

It’s Saturday morning and Jeff

Jimerson walks onto the ice at .

Mellon Arena to belt out the na-
tional anthem for yet another
Penguins’ game.

As a lukewarm Pens fan, Jim-
erson’s bio is as unfamiliar to me
as cross checks and high-sticking.
But judging by his neatly parted,
slightly poofy blonde hair and

' black turtleneck, I’m predicting ,

a corny rendition of “The Star-
Spangled Banner” complete with
vocal acrobatics and added oc-
taves simply because Jimerson
— like most others who sing the
national anthem for crowds of

people — can.

I’m cringing and prepping
myself for an “American Idol”
moment of self-indulgent sing-

whistles on every hook andnote
of the song. I was actually a little
taken aback by Jimerson. It had
been a while since I heard the

It’s an infamously difficult song
to sing, and those who can sing
it really want you know that they
can really sing it.

Divine bestowment aside, there isa sort of artistic challenge
to be met in singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

ing, but Jimerson goes against
the grain and doesn’t turn into a
patriotic diva on ice. He instead
gives a straightforward, but still
impressive, performance with-
out hanging excessive bells and

anthem sung as it was written (or
at least close). It’s a bit abnormal
in our society these days.

To be fair, by nature “The
Star-Spangled Banner” is bound
to attract to some diva singers.

Singer Darryl Reed kindly
tried to explain the situation by
saying,- “The national anthem
is kind of a hard song to sing
sometimes, and God gave me the
strength to put it together.”

Divine bestowment aside,
there is a sort of artistic chal-
lenge to be met in singing “The
Star-Spangled Banner.” A singer
has to have a range of about two
to two-and-a—half octaves to
maketheir way through the low
“Oh say can you see,” to the high
“rockets red glare, the bombs
bursting in air.”

Mariah Carey notably holds
the Guinness World Record for
hitting the highest note (a G7#)
and ranging ﬁve —-— rather than
the traditional two — octaves
over the course of the anthem.

Ironically enough, 50 years
ago Carey’s patriotic perfor-
mance would not have been met
with cheers and an induction
into a book of world records, but

FILM REVIEW _

Film moves to minors

‘League’ a poor take of overused genre

Noah Levinson
Staff Writer

“She’s Out of My League”

Starring: Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve
Director:Jim Field Smith
Paramount Pictures

Grade: D+

When an attractive woman spends her
time dating even an average-looking guy,
quick judgments ﬂy around — “He must
be rich as hell,” or “She must have really
low self- esteem,” or, my personal favorite,
“Maybe she’s blind.”

In “She’s Out of My League,” agorgeous
event planer, Molly (Alice Eve), starts a re-
lationship with sweet, sensitive, average-
looking airport security guard, Kirk (Jay
Baruchel). One question, though, suppos-
edly drives this movie from start to ﬁnish.
Why is she with him? '

character, situation and line of dialogue
is modeled off some other movie about
attractiveness and whatnot.

Kirk, portrayed byjay Baruchel — who
played a novice actor in “Tropic Thunder”
as well as one of Seth Rogan’s character’s
friends in “Knocked Up,” —- has this weird
stew of personas going on inside him. He’s
a little friendly like “Knocked Up” co-star,
Rogan, but dorky like one of those kids
from “Weird Science.” Add a little James
Stewart underdog, and there’s Baruchel’s
persona —- maybe still not ready to lead
a film of his own. ‘i _

Kirk’s friends cannot stop talking
about how ridiculously attractive Molly
— played by relatively—unknown actress
Alice Eve —- is. Still, she’s not all caught
up in her beauty in the Paris Hilton way
from the excruciating “The Hottie & The
Nottie.” ‘

The film goes on for way too long, try-
ing to be amusing in its plot turns, but ends

It seems like every character, situation and line of
dialogue is modeled off someother movie about
attractiveness and whatnot.

That’s not the question I asked for the

T entire 104 minutes, though. .

A better question — why wasn’t this
movie fun? Well, the entire time I was try-
ing to figure out what movie the creators
had watched before diving into “She’s Out
of My League,” because it seems like every

up as annoying. The jokes themselves set-
tle on expletives and physical slapstick. In
one of the film’s funnier moments, Kirk’s

family and friends — including his ex— ,

girlfriend and her new boyfriend —-has
lunch with the smoking—hot Molly. When
they find out how much money she makes

Movie should embrace
low humor ranks

League < 10

Courtesy Darren Michaels

Kirk (Jay Baruchel) and Molly (Alice Eve) make quite the odd couple. Unfortunately,

they can’t spark up any comedic chemistry.

in her line of work, the family goes back
and forth spewing, “F*** you” to each
other. Kirk’s mom —— played by Debra Jo
Rupp — otherwise known as Kitty For-
man on “That ‘70s Show” — even lets an
f—bomb out in amazement.

One of the more disgusting moments
occurs when Kirk gets a little too excited
during a make-out session with Molly.
As Molly’s parents come in to say hello,
Kirk tries to rush out of the room, hiding
the sticky stain on his pants. The scene
is extremely awkward, trying to make an
extremely gross moment not as gross. But

it is gross! You see the stain, the dog licks
it — and it’s sticky! But the scene ends
quickly — the ﬁlm perhaps embarrassed
by its own gross—out humor. “American
Pie” wasn’t afraid of gross—out comedy,
so why should “She’s Out of My League”
be?

The one hopeful in this mess of a film,
though, seems to be T._]. Miller (“Clover—
field”) — who plays Kirk’s airport buddy,
Stainer. Miller keeps Stainer dry, consis-
tent and funny — even coming out of the
“She’s Out of My League” with only a few
scrapes on him.

‘ “Nunsense” tells the story of

people who take on the challenge’ '

of directing a show that they wrote

when certain scenes do not play

“When I write something and

You have to let it go,” Goggin said in

‘an interview over the phone.

V The critical acclaim and fan sup-
port that came in the wake of the
premiere of “Nunsense” inspired
Goggin to continue creating new
chapters for the hilariously holy
saga. They include holiday and old
western specials. The newest entry,
“Nunset Boulevard: The Nunsense

She remembers feeling “terriﬁed”

room, but since she landed the

been the “sweetest” of directors.

“[Goggin] leaves rehearsals

' was essentially the same as cutting up an
American flag and making a napkin out
of it — downright treasonous.

The inﬂuential Russian—born composer
Igor Stravinsky learned not to tamper with
“The Star-Spangled Banner” the hard way
in 1940, when he led the Boston Symphony ,

Orchestra in an unusual rendition of the
national anthem. Shortly after the show,
he was arrested for the violation of federal
law that prohibited the reharmonization
of the national anthem.

Jose Feliciano ran into similar trouble
when he sang an acoustic, bluesy folk ver-

sion of the national anthem at Detroit’s
Tiger Stadium before game ﬁve of the 1968
World Series. Feliciano wasn’t cuffed and
dragged to prison like Stravinsky, but his
performance did cause quite an uproar.
NBC reported people across the country
hurling shoes at their TV sets and veterans
across the nationwere all in a huff.

Feliciano’s performance, which took
place just 10 months beforejimi Hendrix’s
legendary Woodstock rendition of “The
Star-Spangled Banner” was controversial,
but it did crack open the door of inter-
pretation. Performers such as Hendrix
and Aerosmith ——the latter replaced the
lyrics ‘home of the brave’ with ‘home of
the Indianapolis 500’ ——caught some heat
for shaking things up, but not nearly to

_ the degree that Feliciano did.

And so, the road for modern rendi-
tions of “The Star-Spangled Banner” was
paved for Mariah Carey and similar vocal
overachievers and their interpretations
of the national anthem.

 

Yeah, that sounds about
right. God bless America.

From the Windy City to the Steel City, Meaghan Biros is a rising star on the Pitt women’s gymnastic squad.

coaches remained committed to
her, even when an injury during
her sophomore year in high school
scared other schools away.

While doing a tumble at a gym
back home, on a floor that, ac-
cording to Biros, “didn’t have
that much spring,” she hit a
rough patch and felt her lower
back cringe. * .

‘It’s fine,’ she thought, ‘I’ll
keep going.’

But later on she had trouble
breathing. She knew something
was wrong, and decided to go see
a doctor.

“I was doing bars, and I
stopped and broke down because
I couldn’t breathe,” Biros said.

Biros suffered a stress fracture
of her L5 disc in her back, one of
the most stressed discs of the spi-
nal cord, and couldn’t participate
in practices for almost a year.

During that time, she wore
a back brace for half a year and
went to practice to, “do stretches,
but nothing else,” Biros said.

The injury tested her patience
while she was sidelined.

“I hated watching people do
stuff when I couldn’t do any-
thing,” Biros said, “People helped
me through it, but it was really

hard.”

But Pitt coaches knew she
would contribute right away.
Even some teammates take extra

practices.

“She brings a lot of compe-
tition on an individual basis,”
sophomore Alicia Talucci said.
“The best thing about having her
as a teammate is she makes me
want to better myself because
she’s such a competitor.”

She scored a career high
38.850 in the all-around in the
Panthers’ victory over Western

Michigan, George Washing-

ton and Penn on March 5, good
enough for third place overall.

She also scored a career-high
9.650 on the balance beam and
finished fourth overall in the vault
(9.775), uneven bars (9.70) and
ﬂoor exercise (9.725).

Then, a week later, Biros had
another solid night for Pitt against
Arkansas. She beat her career
high in theall-around, scoring a
38.875 after hitting all four of her
routines. This included notching
another career-high score of 9.85
on the vault.

Biros’ score helped lead the
Panthers to a 194.525 on the
night, their third-highest score
of the season. ' V

Biros’ coach, Pitt gymnastics
head coach Debbie Yohman, de-
scribed her as “powerful.”

“The height she gets,” Yohman
said, “she makes it look easy.”

The Rookie of the Week honor

meticulous tracing and care to

“I’ve drawn for a long time,”
Biros said. “My dad is a really
good artist, so he would teach
me things. I’m not great at it but

ing dogs and cats that are cute,”
Biros said. “I’m a visual person,
so if I see something, I like to
draw it.”

Back home in Chicago, Biros
has a dog named Cosmo and a cat
named Crede.

The cat’s name, especially,
demonstrates her other true love:
Chicago sports teams.

Her cat is named after former
Chicago White Sox third baseman
Joe Crede. While Biros was decid-
ing on a name, and watching the
White Sox game, Crede hit a home
run and the name stuck.

“Pierzynski is too long,” Biros
said of White. Sox catcher A] Pier-
zynski, another one of her favor-

Biros admits, being away from
Chicago isn’t too tough, but being
away from Chicago-style pizza,»
that’s a different story. 

“My family and I would get
pizza every Friday. Sorrento’s
doesn’t quite stack up,” Biros
said.

It’s a minor complaint, but one
that Biros said she will endure to -
have the recognized success she’s
had during her freshman year.

Talucci, a standout freshman
gymnast herself, is confident
Biros’ success will continue af-
ter this year. 1‘,

‘‘She’s really talented,” Talucci‘
said, “I think we should deﬁnitely
get used to her receiving recogni-

NHL needs new policy .

Tonyjovenitti
Columnist

 

Dirty hits in the NHL are such a hot topic
that if I collected the twocents that seem-
ingly every single sports writer is putting
into the debate, I might be able to afford
NHL tickets. But there is one thing that
analysts are leaving out: common sense.
Reckless hits came to the forefront of
NHL talk last week after the Penguins’ Matt
Cooke hit Boston Bruins Marc Savard in the
head shortly after Savard shot the puck. Sa-
vard laid on the ice unconscious for several
minutes, and the once-rowdy Mellon Arena

_ crowd fell silent.

discipline czar, couldn’t ﬁnd anything in the
rule book to suspend Cooke. Campbell cited
a similar incident in which Philadelphia
Flyers captain Mike Richards hit Florida
Panthers’ David Booth in the’ head, and
since Richards wasn’t suspended, Cooke
shouldn’t be either. ‘

The general managers of the NHL met
that weekend and quickly proposed a new
rule against blindside hits to the head, but
the riile willlikely not come into ‘effect until
next season and the punishment for such
hits is vague.

Campbell may not have found anything .

in the rule book, but Canadian hockey per-
sonality Don Cherry did. On Hockey Night
in Canada, he expressed his outrage over

   

But again, how can we ever truly know if a player deliberately
tries to injure an opponent. The answer is never.

Cooke didn’t receive a penalty for the
hit (to be fair, neither team’s coach saw
the hit, so it’s not surprising that the refs
didn’t either), but there was much specula-
tion that Cooke would receive a suspension
once the league reviewed the hit. Cooke has
been suspended for dirty hits in the past,
including once this season.

Pitt lights up mound

Women’s softball team readies for upcoming invitational

Softball 4 16 .

performance by Pitt junior pitcher Alyssa
O’Conne1l.

We were conﬁdent, we
were aggressive and we
put the ball in play

Holly Aprile

. O’Connel1 held Quinnipiac scoreless
for ﬁve innings, and the only runs allowed
came off of a three—run homer in the sixth
inning; '

“Offensively, the Panthers struggled

I to generate any sort of rhythm as junior

Ashley Amistade earned Pitt’s only hit of
the game. ,

However, an offensive surge propelled
the Panthers to a 6-5 victory over Drake in
their next game of the tournament.

All of the Panther’s runs came in the
second inning, although only two hits
were recorded. Sophomore Niki Cognigni
sparked the offense by contributing two
hits and driving in two runs.

Ap.rile noted that differences were evi-
dent in the team’s play against Drake as

A I compared to the performance at the plate

in the Quinnipiac-game.
“We were conﬁdent, we were aggres-
sive and we put the ball in play,” Aprile

‘said. “Against Quinnipiac, we struggled

to make proper adjustments. We need to
commit to being aggressive at the plate
at all times.”

The Panthers entered the next day of
tournament-play with scheduled games

against Maine and Jacksonville State and
similar outcomes ensued as Pitt again fin-
ished the day 1-1. .

In a 7-5 win over Maine, the Panthers
relied on three pitchers to secure the vic-
tory. Senior Kayla Zinger earned the sta-
tistical win whereas junior Cory Berliner
recorded the save. O’Connel1 also faced
the Maine batters, giving up four runs in
three innings.

Aprile was pleased with the offensive
production, especially from her freshman

right ﬁelder.

“All the players impress me at differ-
ent times,‘ but freshman Krista Rodgers
has done really well at the plate,” Aprile
said. ~ 1

Rogers contributed two hits and one
run in three at-bats in the Maine con-
test. - _

- But the inconsistency of the Panthers
appeared again in the ﬁnal game of the
tournament as Pitt fell to Jacksonville State
1—o in eight innings. _

» Jacksonville State pitcher Ashley Elias-
son earned, a no—hit shutout as the Pan-
thers failed to connect at the plate.

Aprile believes that the disparity in
offensivegproduction from game to game
has a lotto do with mentality.

“A successful hitter will fail more than
they succeed so you have to keep your
failures in perspective or your conﬁdence
may wane,” Aprile said. “When you have
big innings like the one against Drake, it
helps build confidence if the team trusts

, in that success. Without trust, it is tough

to repeat that success.”

The Panthers (8-9) will look to empha-
size situational hitting and their short
game as they prepare this week for the

upcoming James Madison Invitational, '

which begins Friday when Pitt takes on
Fordham.

The’ referees were watching this one,
and Ovechkin received a 5-minute boarding
penalty and was ejected from the game. Af-
ter a hearing, the NHL suspended Ovechkin
for two games. ~

Saying the NHL disciplinary system is
inconsistent is an understatement. “Ran—

dom” might be a better word for it.

The analysts keep arguingover wheth-
er Cooke deliberately injured Savard or
whether Ovechkin deliberately injured
Ca‘mpbel1 (for the record, Ovechkin said
he didn’t mean to injure Campbell in a
press conference and even offered a public
apology).

But again, how can we ever truly know if
a player deliberately tries to injure an op-
ponent. The answer is never. Alas, we have
found the source of the inconsistency.

‘ These hits often happen so quickly that
referees cannot see everything that hap-
pened. How are they supposed to deter-
mine what the player’s intent was? Even
when the NHL’s discipline team reviews
hits in slow motion, they cannot gage in-
tent.

Therefore, I now come to the point
where I throw in my two cents.

Get rid of the highly subjective word
“deliberate” altogether from the NHL
rulebook. Instead, make any reckless hit
— whether to the head or into the boards
— subject to a ﬁve—minute penalty and a
game misconduct.

Everyone will argue over the intent
of the hits, but even the most biased of
Penguins fans can agree that Cooke’s hit‘
was reckless, the same goes for Ovech-
kin’s hit.

When the referee sees a reckless hit, the
player will be penalized right away. They
won’t have to wait for discipline hearings.

- And for the occasions where it happens

when no refs are looking, then allow the
NHL to review it that evening, and assess a3
one game suspension to the player for the

next game. So even if a player isn’t kicked 5-
out during a game, he will be for the next

game and everything will even out.

Yes, reckless is still a subjective word,
but it is nowhere near as subjective as the
word “deliberate.”

This has got to be better than the cur-
rent system, where we have Matt Cooke
setting up goals for his team one game after

A his extremely reckless hit, while Ovechkin

will be watching from the press box for
similar recklessness.

Instead of looking to past rulings to
try to be consistent, the NHL needs to
address the reason for its inconsistency
and try to ﬁx it.
