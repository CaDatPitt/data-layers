 Meeting

4 » Themes for the fall poetry read-
ing and public speaking program
of ..Women’s Speech Association
were -announ-ced at the initial
speech meeting last Thursday af-
ternoon by President Penn Burke,
-BA, and Vi-ce-President Abbie
_Westermann, Ed.

The public speaking and forum
discussion this semester are to
center around the main topic,
“What is Women.’s Role in a World
at Peace?” This su-bject was brok-
en down into the social, economic,
and political aspects, which are to
be -discussed at three separate
forums.

The ﬁrst forum will be at 2:30
o’clock on Thursday, October 11.
At ' this meeting Abbie Wester-
mann will preside and Lillian
Valli, Ed; Chalotte Ginsburg, Ed;
Adrienne Aldisert, Ed.; and Penn
Burke, ‘BA, will open the forum
by discussing various social as-
pects of women’s part in peace.
The topics will include the family,
the church an-d religion, education,
and the community.

Appointed at the meeting were
committee heads to work up plans
for the two other forums. Lor-
raine Bieno, C, and Sally Oleon,
C, are co-chairmen for the po-
litical-forum, and Betty Waugh,
BA, for the economi-c forum. All
women wishing to participate in
these events are requested to con-
tact these girls..

— In the ﬁeld of poetry reading,
directed by Abbie Westermann, a
series of programs has been ar-
ranged for each month in which
all women interested in reading
poetry aloud may participate. The
theme -for Oct-ober is “Of Shades
and Shivers”; that of November
is, “Counting our Blessings,” an-d
the December meeting is concern-
ed with “A Merry Christmas to
All.” All speech members who
would like to read aloud may see
Abbie Westermann to arrange for
their selections. The ﬁrst program

 is scheduled for   _

‘buff face brick trimmed with

ﬂumed oak. It is well adapted‘ for
entertaining with a spacious living
room opening onto, a large en-
closed verandah which contains an
open ﬁreplace and a small foun-
tain and which is ﬂoored inblack
and white marble in parquet pat-
tern. A notable feature is the en-
trance hallway with its handsome
stairwell surrounded by a ﬁne
Tudor ballastrade.

The" house centers a lot 120 by
180 feet which rises in the rear
to a terrace reached by a ﬂight of
wide stone steps. The property
was acquired in 1920 by Mr. Sny-
der from Mrs. Agnes C. Messler
and the residence was occupied by
Mr. Snyder and his family until
a few years ago.

Mr. Snyder has been a trustee of
the University since 1918 and has
always taken an active part in
University affairs.

but once.” But it’s knocking four
times at Pitt this year. Wednes-
day, Thursday, Friday, and Satur-
day, October 10-13. The occasion
is “Hello Week.”

It will give the forward people
an “excuse” for being forward and
the bashful a “chance” to be for-
ward.

“Hello Week” will begin ofﬁ-
cially with a luncheon in the Tuck
Shops and Mess hall where some
form of entertainment will be fea-
tured.

event and a chance to meet new
personalities. There will be a
dance to the gym on Friday, Octo-
‘ber 12, from 3:30 to 6:30. It will
be a “Get-Acquainted” -dance—
a non—-date affair.

Pitt Alumnae
Commence

Fund Drive

Alumnae of the University met
at a tea Sunday in the Commons
Room. The occasion was the open-
ing of a campaign to raise $25,000
of the $100,000 needed to ﬁnish
a woman’s ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

Miss Helen Pool ‘Rush, Dean of
Women, spoke of the immediate
need of social headquarters for
women students which the ﬂoor
would provide. “A very large en-
rollment of women this fall makes
the ﬂoor more imperative than
ever,” she said.

‘She stressed, however, wider
implications, “the p-otentialities of
the floor for postwar democracy”.

“It will provide training for
the social graces of the home mak-
er and will be important in _the
role women have ‘to play in com-
munity life. As a place for _ﬁne
living it -can create an influence
that will be felt all -over Western
Pennsylvania. It can become a
center that should represent the
ﬁnest in social living.”

The twelfth floor has been set
aside as a floor of women’s ac-
tivities. Here they will have their
teas and gatherings. They will ﬁnd
rooms for rest and relaxation. The
ﬂoor will house a drawing room
as well as an informal room.

Work has already been begun
from funds collected by under-
graduates and from money given
by alumnae before the war. -Miss
Rush asked that the work be no-t
interrupted by‘ lack of money to
continue it.

Mrs. Helen Frost Dice, in charge
of the alumnae campaign, explain-
ed the mechanics of it.

In the case of Pitt more than
other institutions, alumnae have a
debt she said,

Plans were made to contact pos-
sible contributors by mail. Since
there are no other meetings sched-
uled, soliciting and collecting of
funds will be a'matter‘of person-
al initiative, according to Mrs.
Dice.

Miss Elizabeth ‘Teal, assistant
to the Dean of Women, was in
«charge of the tea. She was assisted
by seven undergraduates.

Alumni Smoker

Precedes Game

Bucknell and Pitt men will be
guests of the University Club at a
football smoker, which will be
held by the General Alumni As-
sociation on October 5, as a pre-
lude to the Scheduled. Pitt-Buck-
nell game of October 6. Prominent
guests will be Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, and Dr. Herbert L.
Spencer, President of Bucknell
University.

This will be one of the ﬁrst ac-
tivities of the 1945-1946 year for
the association, which recently or-
ganized for the new year.

Advance announcement is also
being given for the Homecoming

Rally for all Pitt Alumni.

 

Vol. 39,- No. 3

First Pep Assembly

Tomorrow, 4th Hour

The ﬁrst pep assembly of the 1945 football season will take place
tomorrow, Thursday, at 11:30. Fourth hour classes will be dismissed,
thus allowing all students to attend. At this time the student body

will gather at the Bigelow Boulevard entrance to the Cathedral.

If

weather does not permit an outside rally, it will be transferred to

Stephen Foster Memorial.

Not since Clark Shaughnessy started brewing his “T” concoctions

has there been a really represen-9

tative attendance at a pep rally.

The rumor has persisted that the
reason for the ebb in Pitt spirit
was that the Panthers were having
their troubles with the nation’s
grid bigwigs. And so the exist-
ence of a fair-weather attitude to-
wards Pitt football. I I

Now is Pitt’s chance to offer its
rebuttal. A 100 percent turnout
for the rally would do it.

The Pitt band, under the direc-
tion of Robert L. Arthur, will make
its second appearance of the sea-
son, having returned to action with
its performance at the West Vir-
ginia game.

Among the standout features of
the program will be the appear-
ance as a speaker of one of Pitts-
burgh’s foremost sportscasters,
Bob Prince.

Others on the list of speakers
are Coach Shaughnessy, Chancel-
lor Fitzgerald, Dean Biddle, Ath-
letic Director Hagan, and other
coaches. _

And, of course, the cheerleaders
will be on hand to lead the rally.

School Offers
List of Jobs

Are you looking for a job?
What with inﬂationary prices
(banana splits, 350), is insolvency
cramping your social life? Is the
breath of your creditors hot upon
the back of your neck? Well,
brother, worry no more, you have
found the honest way to payyour
debts!

No, this is not an ad for a loan
agency. This is simply to tell you
men, particularly you freshmen,
about the University Placement
bureau, maintained by the Dean of
Men’s oﬂice solely for the purpose
of helping extravagant under-
grads. You see. you’re not the
ﬁrst college student _to go in the
proverbial “ﬁnancial hole.” Your
problem is an old one and the
Dean of Men’s oﬁice knows exactly
how to deal with it.

They have a long, well, pretty
long, list of part-time jobs that
you can ﬁll in your afternoon,
evening or Saturday hours. Some
of them require little more than
that you be on the job and offer
considerable time for study.
Others demand physical labor; but
these, in general, pay higher
wages. It’s just a question of how
quickly you want to get out of
bankruptcy.

Pitkin Club Meets
Next Wednesday

Pitkin club will begin its thirty-
third year when it meets for the
ﬁrst time this semester on Wed-
nesday, October 3, at 5:45 p. m.
at Shadyside Presbyterian church.
Reverend Vance Yarnelle will su-
pervise activities this year.

Religious topics of current in-
terest will be discussed, and the

'1! “Ma/.»e” Z/ze Wade!
We

A salient feature of civilization in our time has been the
reaching of our highest peaks of idealism while we are concur-
rently engaged in the inhuman business of war. The reason, of
course, for this rather ironical phenomenon is that we never
fully appreciate a good thing until it is taken from us. This
war, like the last, has seen a resurgence of feeling in regard to
the necessity for global cooperation. Just as home is never
more wonderful than it is in the mind of a soldier when he is
thousands of miles away, world cooperation similarly reaches the
heights of desirability in the minds of people ﬁghting a war.
However, in the past when peace has come, it has been accom-
panied by indifference and a wave of selﬁsh nationalism, which
sweeps all the hopes of the world’s little people before it.

Today, we stand at the crossroads again.’ The San Fran-
cisco Conference has laid the foundation stones of a workable
mechanism for World peace. Yet, the sly selﬁsh whispers are
starting up already. People whose shortsightedness 1S nothing
short of tragic, are complaining because we are sending large
shipments of food to Europe and endeavoring to help those bat-
tle-scarred countries get back to a semblance of normalcy. They
applauded when lend-lease to Great Britain was terminated and
expressed the hope that we will discontinue all supplies to
Britain. They are constantly clamoring for the premature re-
turn of our armies of occupation. They fail to see that the dead-
ly eﬁfectiveness of modern warfare has woven the «future of all
peoples into one common pattern and bound us to one common
destiny. This time, the awesome destructive power of the
atomic bomb may prove the spur needed for piercing the tough

.hide of selﬁshness and. indifference. In short, we have tried be-

fore and failed. Now, with the means -of destruction science
has produced and will produce, failure may well mean suicide.
Of course, this does not mean that we must strive to attain
perfection overnight, for it goes without saying that human
ideals‘ are always many steps ahead of human accomplishments
-——which is generally a" healthy condition in itself. However, it
does mean that we must gradually change our thinking habits

. from thinking in terms of national ﬂags and national boundaries

to putting our thoughts and concepts on an international basis,

' “so that the world gradually evolves, for us, into one big neigh- _

borhood of people. As “citizens of the world,” we will see that
there is more than one side to many vexing problems and we
will come to learn and appreciate more fully the values of com-
promise and arbitration. In the past, our lives and the scope of
our national achievements have been the result and sum total of
innumerable individual and group accomplishments. Similarly,
in the future, “our” world will be what we make it.
' Jim Pettican.

If we, at Pitt, during the past few years were accused of
not having much school spirit, we half-heartedly could clear
our conscience by answering that the lack of spirit was due
to the “war.” We were without a band to lead us in “Hail to
Pitt” and the “Alma Mater,” our cheerleaders were drafted
from game to game; and some of us just didn’t have the estatic
attitude generally displayed in the grandstands. Our minds
wandered off to the battle ﬁelds of Europe and the South Paciﬁc
where the greatest grid games of the century were being played.
We had only one goal to reach, victory. And it must be ﬁnal
for the wounds of one game would not heal in time for us to
brush up on our plays and score in the next tilt.

Things have changed now and we are gradually returning
to normalcy. We can no longer harangue on the band. Favor-
able comments have been received on the music the band sup-
plied at last Saturday’s game, and We are looking forward to
the time when the boys will be well organized and trained to
march out onto the ﬁeld. Granted, the cheerleaders are new,
but if we show our loyal spirit we will learn the cheers they had
mimeographed for us, and cooperate with them at the games.
This year’s football schedule shows plenty of opportunity
or us to yet get out and back up our team, prove to the squad
that we are supporting them, win or lose. There are seven
more games to be played in our home stadium.

Women Vets

Needs Met

Greensboro, N. C.—(I.P.)— To
meet the needs of women war
veterans, the faculty of The Wom-
en’s College of the University of
North Carolina ‘has set up a Vet-
erans Education committee, ap-
proved certain modiﬁcations of
courses, and provided for a com-
mittee on curriculum problems,
looking toward further changes.

Important in the plans for meet-
ing the needs of service women is
the decision to allow nurses of the
army and navy medical corp-s to
o-btain a college degree by taking
two years of college work, in ad-
dition to the nurses’ training al-
ready received. ‘

It is recommended that this also
apply to graduate nurses of ap-
proved hospitals who have car-
ried on their profession on the
home front -during the war, the
faculty recognizing an obligation
to public health nurses, who face
the probability of being required
to obtain college degrees.

Other proposed curriculum
changes are the setting up of spe-
cial physiotherapy, homemaking
an-d recreati-on courses for women
veterans and placing ﬁrst year
foreign language courses on a six-
day-a-week basis to -enable stu-

dents to -ﬁnish the entire language

requirement in one year.

‘The Veterans’ Education com-
mittee is charged with dealing
“with all problems relating to the
academic placement of veterans,
psych-ological testing, academic
an-d social advising”; with publi-
cizing the pr-ogram, and with rec-
ommending further curriculum
changes to meet the needs and in-
terests of women veterans.

The committee on curriculum
problems will consist of a faculty
committee of 20 members, one to
be elected by each o.f the 20 ma-
jor departments, and a student
advisory -committee of like num-
ber and representative, to be chos-
en by students majoring in the
departments. Each division shall
-elect a steering committee of ﬁve
members -to coordinate ﬁndings
and recommendations of the larger
committee.

Norwegian Room
Completed

Reconversion at Pitt has begun!
But, insofar as the Norwegian
room is concerned, it is ﬁnished.
When the war descended upon us,
the room was only partially com-
pleted, but with the need for
space so great, it was thrown open
to classes as it was. When the

Air Corps left, pressure for space’,

slackened, and last year the work

of completion was again taken up.-

Now, at last, the Norwegian room
is open for classes——this time, ﬁn-
ished. The work was done under
the guidance and supervision of
Eric Eliassen of Oslo, Norway,
the architect and designer of the
room.

According to Albert A. Klim-
chek, University architect, “The
Norwegian room is built en-
tirely of wood (walls, floor, and
ceiling) in accord with centuries-
old tradition of the people of that
country. Simplicity, modesty, and
the unselﬁsh minds of the Nor-
wegian people were the chief na-
tional characteristics the
moulding of paneled woodwork on
the walls are of simple contour
and the panels themselves simple
in shape. The painted beams of
the low, ﬁat ceiling of this area
also present a traditional habit of
the native architects and indicate
a further desire to make the in-
teriors warm and cheerful look-
ing . . .”

In describing the furniture, Mr.
Klimchek said of the professor’s
table: “A Norwegian table is
never one with just four legs and
a top but is usually designed with
utility, durability and beauty in
mind.”

Pitt is justly proud of this latest
addition to her family of com-
pleted Nationality rooms.

ROTC Organized
On New Basis

The ROTC unit at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh will be organ-
ized on a new basis this year, ac-
cording to Major Wills C.A.C.,
commanding ofﬁcer. The enlarged
enrollment in Military Science,
150 freshmen this fall as compared
with 85 last February, has enabled
the department to form a complete
battalion.

The freshmen are to be com-
manded by cadet oﬂicers who will
be chosen this week from the up-
perclass ROTC men. Several
freshmen who have had previous
mlitary training will also be can-
didates for officer positions. About
45 cadet oﬁ‘icers will be chosen, in-
cluding one battalion commander,
two company commanders, four
platoon sergeants and thirty-two
squad leaders and assistant squad
leaders.

At present, the upperclassmen
are under command of Major Wil-
liam Havlak, C.A.C., and the
freshmen are being given instruc-
tions by M/‘.Sgts. Doherty, Black,

Flynn, and Sergeant Shablowski.

Flying Club
Announces

Meeting

Attention veterans and ﬂying
fans! The ﬁrst formal meeting of
the Pitt Flying Club will take
place on Thursday, October 11 in
room 132 the fourth hour.

The Pitt Flying Club was ﬁrst
organized in the spring semester
of 1945 for the purpose of promot-
ing an aviation program at Pitt.
There has been a widespread in-
terest in all phases of aviation,
and as a result a group of en-
thusiastic students headed by Sam
Heggie, aviation major, organized
a meeting with the deans of the
different scho-ols at the Univer-
sity. The decision of the meeting
was to contract a private ﬂight
school which would operate from
the County Airport for the pres-
ent time. With this news, more
than a hundred students expressed
their -desire to ﬂy by signing ap-
plications for -charter membership
in the club. This spurred the com.-
mittee into immediate action and
much work was devoted in ﬁnding
a suitable contractor offering suf-
ﬁci-ently reduced rates for the
members.

On July 13 a group of 13 mem-
bers met at the University and
were taken to the Pitt Wilkins
Airport. These members were an
experimental group; in fact, they
were the ﬁrst students to take
actual ﬂight lessons sponsored by
a ﬂight contractor, now operating
from the County Airport. During
the summer period this group was
increased to 25-.

Plans of the ﬁrst meeting of the
fall semester include the election
of oﬁ‘icers and the adoption of a
constitution, requirements for

‘be discussed. Sam Heggie, pr-esid- _

veterans will be chosen to meet
with the representatives of the
Univers-ity, and clarify those who
are eligible to take ﬂight instruc-
tion under the existing laws of
the veteran’s administration. Sam

urges as many interested veter-

ans as possible to_attend this meet-
ing because he believes that
through their combined efforts,‘

the attainment of ﬂight training .3
under the government sponsored ’

programs can be achieved.

“The University has cooperated
in -helping the clubV-
fulﬁll its ambitions,” Sam said." '

Cwen Directories

Ready For Print

I know you fellows are just
dying to know the name of that
luscious blonde who sits in front
of you in history class; and, no
kidding, I'll bet she’s anrious that
you know it, too. But those Cwen
directories» j.ust aren't ready yet.
Of course, everyone on campus
will want one and that’s quite a
large order for the Cwens and
the’ printer.

The directory has been the
Cwen’s big contribution to our
campus but they {began their ac-
tivities early this year. The thirty-
three Cwens served as ushers at
the Freshman Green Armband
ceremony and also as aides at the
High Tea.

Another tremendous task they

have undertaken is that of serving

as hostesses for the ﬁfteen Nation-
ality rooms.

But that’s  . th-e beginning!
The arrival or the directories in
October will mark the conclusion
of a project now under way. Re-
member, both -will be worth
watching and waiting for.

cal, -physical and biological sci-
ences, to be administered by the

National Research Council has an-
nounced.

Each applicant, nominated by a

ofwhis graduate school, will be ap-
pointed for such terms as are
deemed ‘necessary for the attain-
ment of a degree. He will be sub-
ject to periodic reviews of his
progress.

Band Expecte-Tl
To Enlarge

A good band promotes school
spirit at the football games.
Pitt alumnus will tell, you how
the big gold and blue bands of
former years ﬁlled the spectators
with pep and enthusiasm as they
swing along to stirring marches
and executed smartly styled for-
mations. The tread of martial
feet has always stirred human
emotion and just as “there is some-
thing about a soldier,” there is
also something about a bandsman.

{Robert L. Arthur, counselor to
student activities, and director of
University band and orchestra, is
reorganizing the band this fall
and attempting to restore it to a
pre-war basis. All those who are
qualiﬁed are urged to turn out.
If you play a band instrument
watch the ground ﬂoor bulletin
board for rehearsal announce-
ments and report as soon as pos-
sible. Rehearsals will probably be
in 817 CL.

- Dr. Jotham Johnson
Classics Head

Resumes Post

In College

Another of Pitt’s former staff
members has doffed his Navy uni-
form for the title of professor.

Lt. Comdr. Jotham Johnson,
now on terminal leave from the
Navy, has been named acting head
of the classics department of the
University. He succeeds Dr. James
R. Stinchcomb who died July 13.

Dr. Johnson was assistant pro-
fessor of classics in 1937 until he
was commissioned as lieutenant
(j.g.) in February, 1942. He was
ﬁeld director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum expedition
to Minturnae, Italy, from 1931 to
1934.

The new classics professor was
the only American authorized to
excavate in Italy since 1913. For
this Work he had had three years
of practical archaeological ex-
perience in Greece and Syria.

He and his assistants discovered
and excavated the forum of Min-
turnae and its surrounding monu-
ments including seven temples, a
theater, a large public colonnade,
and numerous Roman sculptures
and inscriptions. Their many dis-
coveries are on exhibition in the
University of Pennsylvania Mu-
seum and in the National Museum,
Naples.

During his overseas service Dr.
Johnson revisited the site of the
excavations. “It was in surpris-
ingly good condition,” he said.
“Despite the war, very little dam-
age was suffered.”

Dr. Johnson received his Doctor
of Philosophy degree in 1931 at
the University of Pennsylvania.
While in service he trained at the
US Naval Station, Key West, Fla.
In October, 1944, he was ordered
to an advanced base overseas as
ﬂag secretary and later as ﬂag

mandant of the base.

  Faculty Members Return

To Campus Posts

More veterans! Here is more
news about veterans at Pitt.
Strangely enough, they are ‘not
students but faculty members.
Har-old A. Phelps traded Lieuten-
ant for Professor when he came
back to his former position as
-professor of sociology. He was do-
ing naval training work on the
West Coast.

With Dr.. Phelps have come men
returning to almost every depart-
ment in the College. In the biology
department, Capt. Kenneth Wert—
man, -who was with the Army
Medical college in Washington, D.
C., has returned to rep_la-c-e Dr. A.
B. Wallgren who -has retired be-
cause of illness.

From the Chemical Warfare
Board at Aberdeen, Maryland,
comes Capt. Douglas G. Nichol-
son who will be assistant profes-
sor of chemistry. Before the war
he taught at the University of Il-
linois. Lt. Commander Jotham
Johnson, who had been stationed
at a naval bas at Oran, North
Aifri-ca, has returned as assistant
professor of -classics and acting
head of the department, while
from the Navy comes Lt. Robert
X. Graham who was in charge of
publicity at Great Lakes Naval

Icardi Coaches
Cheerleaders

Th-e cheerleaders performing an-
tics for the Pep Rally on ‘Thurs-
day, October 4, are the result of
the coaching of Captain Aldo
Icardi, a former student awaiting
discharge ‘from the paratroops.

He devoted his leave to train-
ing Pitts -cheerleaders in the art
of getting booming cheers and

in real spirit to back up a winning

team.

Those Pitt students of a -few
years ago will recall Captain
Icar-di as a very active cheerlead-
er, well qualiﬁed to train cheer-
leaders. ‘

Under his direction -a new sys-
tem is being used this year to
unify cheers. Mimeographed sheets
are ‘being distributed at the games,
on which cheers are typed and
numbered. Cards are placed in
back of the cheer leaders. and the
numbers on the -cards coincide
with those of the various cheers.

"With all this assistance we can
and should be able to cheer in a
really big way. How about a loud
cheer of thanks to Ike.

We’ve been hearing many green
arm-band wearers asking, “What’s
that pin?” or saying, “Oh, what a
pretty pin”! These pretty pins,
my lassies, belong to Pitt sorority
women and some of those espe-
cially good-looking pins formerly
belonged to fraternity men, who
are now letting their best girls
wear them.

Speaking of pins, Annette Sil-
ver, A E Phi president, has added
to her Pi Lam pin, a beautiful
diamond ring for THE ﬁnger. The
lucky guy is Jerry Buchman, Pitt
Med student.

Alpha Kappa Alpha are having
their “Chilly Feed” at the Ammon
Recreation Center, immediately
ater the Pitt victory (we hope)
over Bucknell.

Alice Blatteau and Frieda Ham-

mermiester have been formally

Congratulations, girls!

Congratulations are due down

married Frank Zender and Martha
Carmen married her air corp lieu-
tenant.

The Tri Delts are looking for-
ward to having a gala time after
the Bucknell game. En masse,
they are going to Lola Ward’s
home, where they will have a
wiener roast.

The Delta Zetas are expecting
their Sorors from Bucknell to
come down for this week’s game.
The sorority is glad to welcome
Mrs. Alma Smith who has suc-
ceeded Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson as
housemother.

A big “get well” to Jeanne
Goushe, who won’t be able to be
with her Theta sisters for a while.
Jeanne is in Shadyside Hospital,
ﬁghting a case of pneumonia.

Kappa Kappa Gamma will be
guests of the Delts at a Tea—Dance

The ﬁrst week of fraternity ac-
tivity was marked by an ever in-
creasing tide of returning veter-
ans. Phi Delt, George Lynn is back
on campus after being overseas
for the past two years. PiKA’s Bob
Mild, Bob Smith, ‘and Bill Dev-
lin were welcomed back. with a
dance held in their honor after
the West Virginia game. Other
weekend social events included a
dinner dance held by the Delts in
their chapter house and a dance
held by the Phi Kaps in honor of
Ray Wach who is leaving shortly
for the army. The Delts also wish
to announce the election of David
Deise as treasurer. Further elec-
tion results showed George Po-
limus as president of S. A. E. and
Lou Carpenter as new president of
Sigma Chi.

Ray Gasper, Bill De Stein, Pete
Dobda, Mike Costello, and «Chuck
Harrison have recently become
Sigma Chi brothers. and Norbert
Sihamblatt and Kenny‘ Lenchner

The Phi Gams have completed
plans for an ‘all: day affair for ac-
tives and alumni this coming
Saturday. The affair will start
with the Bucknell game and will
end with a dance held at one of
Pittsburgh’s ﬁner clubs.

From Pi Lam.-coimes the news
that a dance band -consisting of

Deep sympathies are extended
to the Phi Delts who lost brother
Jimmy Layton this summer.

Pitt—West Virginia game. What
fun!

Theta Phi Alpha will initiate
Margie Cole, Margie Dixon, Lou
Guidish, Corky Robinson, Mary

IdahoCollege
Makes Plans

For Veterans

Caldwell, I-daho -— (I.P.) --The
an,sw.er to the question “What to
dotwith the married veteran who
wants to go to college under G.I.
educational beneﬁts?” has been
given zb.y,. the College of I-daho in
thepurchase of the Premier Auto
Court, self-styled, “The Finest in
the;West,” adjacent to the campus.

Theﬁcourt contains eight attrac-
tiv_e,;cottages with ﬁfteen fully
furnished ‘apartment units, ready
to ;serve as many returning veter-
ans and their brides. The large
ho_;n_1e in the -compound will be
converted into quarters for ten
or '- twelve men students, and the
(ﬁlling station and lunch counter
will.:.be operated on a lease basis.
To..the extent that the cottages
are not immediately used by mar-
ried couples and during vacation
per.iods,. they .will continue to be
av‘aila=b'le to tourists an-d other
transients. - i

“The College -of Idaho has tak-
en‘ this step as an emergency
In-easure,” declared -President W.
W,”_Hall, Jr-., “to meet the antici-
pated need of married veterans
for, living quarters on the campus.
At‘ the same time it will provide
housing :for a number of single
men for whom dormitory accom-
m'oda'tions are not at present avail-
able. _ ; i _

.“-‘With both campus dormitories
ﬁlled to capacity with women stu-
dents the College is bursting at
the seams to accommodate its ap-
plicants. This condition promises
to;become aggravated as the back-
togcollege movement progresses
among both returning war veter-
ans and non-veterans. Purchase of
the auto court is designed to meet
this situation and also to provide
through its auxiliary services and
tourist trade a sound and con-
tinuing ﬁnancial investment.”

Arrives

On Campus

Dr. James Taylor, head of the
Mathematics Department, an-
nounces deﬁnite information on
the Aviation ‘Program and Pitt’s
Link Trainer.

The Link Trainer arrived Tues-
day, September 25th. A room has
been completed for its use on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral. Ap-
parently the University is one of
the ﬁrst in the country to obtain
a Link Trainer from surplus prop-
erty allotments. Recently, a repre-
sentative from another Univer-
sity was here, inquiring how we
were able to get it, and sought in-
formation concerning our Aviation
Program. Miss Grace Statler and
Mr. Strothman, returned veterans,
have been appointed to assist in
the Link Trainer instruction.

The uses for the Link Trainer
are:

1. As laboratory equipment for
courses in Navigation and Physics
of Flight. The Trainer will be used
to a very large extent in Mathe-
matics 131, 132, Advanced Navi-
gation, and to a more limited ex-
tent in Math. 25, 26, Navigation,
Physics 13, and «Physics of Flight.

2. The Link Trainer will be
available on a fee basis for those
who wish 2 or 3 hours of Link to
supplement elementary ﬂight les-
sons.

3. The Link Trainer will be
available on a fee basis. for a com-
plete course in Link or for those
who seek instrument ﬂying rat-
ings.

' _ FLYING

1. Contracts for ﬂight lessons
under the University auspices are
in their ﬁnal stage. Announce-
ments will be released soon.

2. 23 students began ﬂying this
summer by in~divi~du.al arrange-
ments at reduced rates with one
of the ﬂying schools. Contracts are
now being negotiated with this
school.

3. Formal organization meeting

of the Pitt Flying Club will take ‘

place in room 132, the 4th hour,
on Thursday, October 11.

4. Two meetings last spring re-
sulted in a list of over 200 pro-
spective members. The coming
meeting is for formal adoption of
the constitution and by-laws, and
perspective plans for the future. _

One last note before the editor
reminds me again about the paper
shortage: the YWCA membership
week starts the 15th of October.

See you at all the events.

Until then, this is the Y Liner

Based on the lackadaisical as-
sumption that two can write as
cheaply as one, this week’s Pitt-
pourri becomes a journalistic duet
as it swings into high gear with a

vengeance. Now that there are
two of us to share the blame on
an equal basis, we can hurl twice
as many brickbats as before and
stick out our respective tongues
twice at every cash customer. So
with the ﬂossy and frilly formali-
ties dispensed with, let’s start hit-
ting the high spots on the low-

Pitt Line-up Remains

By Allan Roth

The Pitt Panther gridmen, high-
ly elated over breaking into the
win column by virtue of their
romp over West Virginia now
point toward this week’s battle
with Bucknell with ‘-high hopes of,
making it two in a row.

The thundering herd, tutored by
Elwood “Woody” Ludwig, A Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. -alumnus,
has been in action three times this
fall and has a victory and two
losses to show. The Bisons opened
their season early on September
12 when they threw the University
of Scranton gridders, but then
dropped the next two starts, one
by a 19-7 -count to the Wildcats of
Villanova College and in the sec-
ond they ended up on the short
end of a hard-fought 1'19-8 decision
to Ed. -McKeever’s highly touted
Cornell eleven last Saturday aft-
ernoon.

Ludwig will bring a strange
conglameration of talent with him
from Lewisburg, Pa. His squad be-
ing made up of a mixture of 17
years olds, Navy V-12 Trainees,
4-F"s, and veterans, with an age
range, in years, from youngsters of
17 to men of 248. The Bison con-
tingent made up of ‘about 38 men
will include nine holdovers from

won seven, lost two and were tied
once. More than half the entire
Bison roster is made up of the
Navy V-12 trainees. b

A glance at the probable start-
ing lineup of .Saturday’s guests at
Pitt Stadium would show, at the
ends, Paul Rutan and Bob Wil-
liams, a co-captain of the visitors.
Rutan is a Navy man hailing. from
Swarthmore, Pa., and is 6-1 tall,
tip-ping the scales at 18-5 lbs. He
saw action with Bucknell last year
and is an excellent pass—receiver.
Williams, also a veteran of last sea-
son’s Bucknell squad, is one of the
biggest men in the starting lineups,
standing 6-3 and weighing 205.
He is 19 years old and hailsfrom
the high school football capital

1945 edition of Clark Shaughnes-
sy’s Golden Panthers ran rough-
shod over Ira -Rogers Mountaineers
to the tune of 20-0, all scoring
coming in the first half. The first
Panther bid for victory came in
the ﬁrs't quarter when Mike Rous-
sos, erstwhile tackle converted to
tailback, plunged over from the
one. The second score -came later
in the same period when Jimmy
Joe Robinson -crossed the goal-
line for thesix points. Both points
after touchdown were neatly con-
verted by big Roussos. The last 6
pointer of the afternoon came in
the second period when George
Linelli, ex—Peabody High gridder
went over on a short jaunt. The
pass from center was dropped and
Roussos who had gone back to at-
tempt the conversion was forced
to plunge for the extra point and
was knocked down short of the
goal line. The Pittites had many
chances to score in the second half
but booted away every opportu-
nity. Especially poor were the Pitt
reserve backﬁelders in pass re-
ception which would have upped
their margin of victory had their
intended receivers held onto them.

Start For F loormen

Dr. Carlson has planned an early start for his 1945 basketeers.
The varsity squad will be fully equipped by October 5 and the ﬁrst
work outs scheduled on the Stadium for October 8 and 9 at 4:30

ed following the freshman tour-'

neys and football season. The
freshman tourneys will get under
way at 2 o’clock and end at
5 on Ocober 10. All freshmen
who -wish to try out for the
team must be present some-
time during the day and br.ing
their own nbasketball equipment.
The school -willgsupply towels and
lockers. The vdiﬁiculty in getting
sport’s equipment necessitates this.
The tourneys will be run off in
the following manner. Teams will
be chosen at random. As soon as
ten men arrive the game begins.
Each player will -be given an op-
portunity to play. At the com-
pletion of the tournaments, Coach
Carlson will assign those who
make the (best showing to the
Varsity and the remaining boys
to the Junior Varsity.
Six Returning Letterman

The Panthers have six letter

tion, w-hile Hank Zeller, Mr. Big
of the Panthers, is one up on him.

A Great Season Ahead"

The outlook at the present time,
is very bright for Dr. Carlson.
With the largest squad in many
a year and‘ many of these boys
with previous experien-ce are
available. If everything goes well
maybe this years squad will be
the doctor’s Number 2 Win ’em All

I was talking to Ed Zimmovan
the other day. You know, Pitt had
one touchdown in the game against
Ilinois, and Ed was the «boy who
made it. The 6 feet 1 inch, 180
pound halﬁback from Uniontown
was a little shy in talking about
his merits on the ﬁeld, but I did
manage to get a few answers.

This is Ed’s second year at Pitt
and his second year on the Pitt
football squad. His football career
dates all the way back to his days
at North Union where he played
for about a year. But he wasn’t
always a halfback. ‘That's some-
thing new. Just last year he held
his own at end very well, and

now h-e’s catching on fast at right
half. Keeping in the athletic line
both in and out of school, Ed is
in the -Physical Education depart-
ment and will probably be on the
coaching end of football some day.

As I said before, it was pretty
hard getting answers out ofeEd.
He’s a boy of a very few words.
For instance, I asked him if there
were anything in particular he
liked a lot, and he replied,

Steaks.

‘Of course, I was hinting around
for something else so I asked,

What about the women?

To that question I merely got
a shrug. of the shoulders. But I
kept trying.

“What is it Ed, blondles, brun--
ettes, or redheads?” I asked.

Blondes, I guess. ‘

-I still wasn’t satisﬁed.

Blondes, I repeated. Is that all?

Well, I like baseball, too.

I thought if I got him talking
about the team an-d its prospects
for the year he’-d be more talka-
tive so I asked,

How do you think Pitt will do
this year? *

Good, he replied.

Yes, Ed’s a man of a few words,
but he has'already shown that
action speaks louder than words.

A Word About the Game

For an undermanned and excep-
tionally green team the West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers played a game
that no West Virginian should be
ashamed of. The Panthers entered
the game with an edge in weight,
experience and reserves and de-
spite it all the Mountaineers fought
back and fought hard. The West
Virginians either played over their
heads or the Panthers were under
par, I believe the latter is true.
The Jungle Cats might think they

played a great game, but they are

the only ones that think so. True,
Roussos went through the Moun-
taineer line’ for large gains. But
he fell over himself and came to

earth without a Mountaineer
around.

Captain Aldo Icardi, former Pitt
cheerleader, should be given the
credit for this year’s cheerleaders.
Captain Ike spent his afternoons
last week preparing the boys for
the home opener. Ike is the last
of the colorful cheerleaders that
the present crop of Pitt students
remember. Possibly his half bald

cheering days on the gridiron. If

Future of Pitt's Minor Sports
Undecided

Are we going to have baseball
this spring? Will Pitt ﬁeld a
track squad? Is tennis coming
back to the courts on the hill?
According to James Hagan, Pitt
Athletic Director, their future
will be decided at a meeting in
November. It is more than likely
that Pitt will again place teams in
these minor sports. Coach Ralph
Miterling, baseball coach, is still at
Skyscraper U and has turned his
services over to Clark Shaugh—
nessy for the winter. Back at the
university on terminal leave is
Olsen, former track coach. Olsen
produced track teams that gained
the highest honors in the United
States and this is a perfect year
to get back into the competition,
with such men in the Jimmy Joe
Robinson calibre around. Doc
Hartwig, Panther tennis coach un-
til it was dropped last year, is
now assistant football coach. The
court game at Pitt was dropped
because of the lack of interest.
If the playing interest is as great
for these minor sports as it is for
football and basketball nothing
can stop us from again having

‘Dd 5/zeta/net

By Jim Furbee

Among the many veterans en-
rolled at Pitt un-der the ‘G. 1. Bill
of Rights, is former Staff Sergeant
James Shannon, a typical Ex—G.I.

He lived in Pleasant Hills, and
graduated from Langley High in
1938. He worked at General Elec-
tric until a few months after Pearl
Harbor, when he enlisted in the
Air Corps. Soon, Jim was Staff
Sergeant and a gunner on a B-29,
4«0~1st Bomber Group, England.

Jim is reluctant about having
his awards put in this column, but
after some persuasion he said, “I
got the D.F.:C., and the Air Medal
and some clusters.”

Jim is a good looking chap,
about 5 feet, ten inches, medium
stature, dark hair, and keen blue
eyes. He enjoys a good time, but
feels that all extr-acurri-cular ac-
tivities will have to wait until he

' gets a good start’ scho.lastically.

-We don’t believe any of us have
more enthusiasm than Jim. He
says enthusiastically, “I was just
as happy when I got my Pitt reg-

got my discharge papers.”

The regular Chapel service will
-be observed this Friday, October
5, at one o’clock in Heinz Chapel.
Dr. Farmer, student chaplain, will
be the speaker.

The Heinz Chapel Choir will
make its ﬁrst appearance of the
year at this meeting. Margaret
Hurrell will act as student leader.

All stud-ents are urged to at-
tend the service which will con-
clude at 1:25. Fred'Lotz, Univer-
sity organist, will be at the organ.

Jim, a freshman in the College,
is taking a Pre-Dent course. He
says, somewhat ironically, that he
would rather be on the giving end
of the drill than the receiving end.

W-ell, we feel that “Doc” Shan-
non will be good enough to grind
away on our molars any day. So
here’s wishing Jim Shannon lots
of luck. With his attitude he’s
bound to succeed.

(Vets Reunite P
At Registration

Two Pitt freshmen—both vet-
erans of sea action from Trinidad
to Casablanca--agreed this week
that it's a small world, after all.

The pair, Charles Brownﬁeld-, of
Uniontown, and Alvin Roy Mey-
ers, of Brentwood, had to go half-
way around the world to meet ‘at
Casablanca, where they were sta-
tioned together for 16 months be-
fore Alvin shipped out in August,
1944, for the invasion of Southern
France. ' 1

Last week they met again in the
ofﬁ-ce of the Registrar and discov-
ered on-ce more that their paths
had converged. Although the two
had lost ‘touch with each other
since they were buddies in North
Africa, both had returned to this
country, received Navy disc-harges,
and entered Pitt in time for- the
fall semester. ‘ ‘ .

Charles and Alvin, both’ regis-
tered in the College, served as
Navy radiomen in the ‘South
American area and in the North
African and Mediterranean‘ thea-
ters. " ‘ ‘
