Effects of amnesty
policy unclear

By Aaron Stier- Cohen
Staff Writer

COVER PHllTll BY STEVEN GAREINKEE

It’s been almost 10 months since the Pennsylvania
General Assembly unanimously passed the state’s
alcohol amnesty bill

The act, which was signed into law on_]uly 7,
grants amnesty onlytothe underage drinkerwho
calls emergency services foranintoxicated friend.
The underage personwhocallsthe policewillnot
-face prosecution forund " edrinking_orposses~
sion of alcoholas longas the person believes he
is theﬁrstperson tocontact emergency services,
does it in “goodfai ,” provides his name to the
emergency officer or operator andwaits with the
friend until help arrives.

Now the new arrmesty bill is playing out in .

college campuses across Pennsylvania, and for
col1egeslikePitt, which previouslyhadazero-tol-
erance policywithregardstounderagedrinking,
that means a change in policy. Pitt made changes
to its Student Code of Conduct last summer to
adhere to the state law.
Butexpertssayit’shardtotellifit’s madeadif—
ference. Pitt Policecommuriity Relations Officer
Ron Bennett said it's hard to tell if the new policy
is havingany effect on students.
“Right now it doesn’t appear that anyone is
 the new policy,” Bennett said.
Sean Moll, legislative assistant to State Sen.
John Rafferty, R-Montgomery, the first sponsor
of the Senate bill448, said that he hasn’t received
any updates on how the new law is doing.
Wendy Zellner, UPMC Media Relations Direc-
tor, said that they have no way of knowing if the

_ amnesty bill has resulted in more young adults

being admitted because of alcohol.

“We do not track patient visits to [the Hos-
pital] as being ‘alcohol-related,” Zeller said in
an email. “So I don’t have any real trends that I
canprovide.” '

Moll said that in researching the bill, the Sen-
ate found that there are very few non—vehicle re-
lated student alcohol deaths across the state, but
anythingthatcanbe done to rninimizeeven those
deathsis aproductiveuseof state power. “Itsreally
common sense legislation,” Moll said. “You can
tell just from the voting numbers everyone was
on the same page.” I

Poling berpng kills iesspential forcollee

By Andrew Gretchko
Stajf Wri ter

A case of beer holds a lot of possi-
bilities on a Friday night, but there
are more productive methods of
attaining belligerency than just
drinking it straight. And in the
words ofthe “Beerfest” character
Landﬁll, “We’re the party brigade,
and we’re here to play some drink-
ing games.” i

, Drinking games serve a dual
purpose: They help to bring people

together while also encouraging ‘

them to drink more. There’s one
classic drinking game that reins
supreme and towers over the rest:
beer pong. V

Let’s start with the basics: Set
up 10 plastic cups in a triangular
shape on a table, with four in a row
at the very end of the table and the
rest ﬁltered in respectively, then
ﬁll the cups one-quarter of the way
with water.

... 77- ..,.._......,....c,. ..... , > o.

Some people play with six cups.

‘Stop that. You’re giving the game

ball into one of the opposing team’s

cups on the op- T the next
ponents’ end.   a  round.
Sounds narne DidI
easy,ri t? I’ve T A ' mention
Seen too many .      .  that the,
games go on i oppo-

far longer than they should, prov-
ing the difﬁculty of the game. Add
alcohol to themix and a potentially
simple game becomes a drawn-out
affair.

Beer pong begins when one
player from each team takes a ping-

nents look each other in the eye
when they shoot? This is called
eye-to-eye, and it makes the game
much more difficult. The two play-

ers continue this sequence until i

one player makes a cup.
The game continues in a back-

and-forth manner, each side mak-
ing two consecutive attempts at
shooting their ping-pong balls into
the opponents’ remaining cups
until one side achieves victory by
making a shot into all of the op-
ponents’ cups.

While these might be the oﬂicial
rules of the game, there are also
a few house rules that help keep
the game interesting. Some of the
staples include “balls back” (when
both players on one team score in
one round), “re—racks” (a rule that
dictates how y times a team
can change that-':nf?)r1l'mation of their
opponents’ cups) and “redemp-
tion” (a method that gives the los-
ing team a chance to shoot their
balls one last time, and if success-
ful, continue until they miss).

After the formal rules are sort-
ed out, things begin to get fun. My
personalfavorite is the NBA Jam
rule. Based on the popular 1993
video game known for its high-ﬂy-
ing dunks and “Boom Shakalaka”

sound effects, this rule puts the
video game’s “on ﬁre” component
into effect.

' In NBA Jam, if a player made
two shots in a row, the announcer
would yell, “He’s heating up!” to
tempt the player to drain a third
straight basket, which would
cause the announcer to yell “He’s
on ﬁre!”

This would transform the suc-
cessful shooter into a deadly weap-
on, wielding a ﬂaming basketball
that never failed to swish through
the hoop as the player made shot

after shot. The video game trans-'

lates well into beer pong. When one
person makes three consecutive
shots, the player earns the “on ﬁre”

‘ status, which allows them to shoot

continuously until they miss.
While Pitt beer pong may not
emulate the Las Vegas World Se-
ries of Beer Pong, it’s still nothing
to take lightly. When it comes to
this drinking game, practice makes
perfect. i i

For those who want to add some competi-

tion to their drinking, here are four essen- T

tial drinking games. Just remember that the
point is fun, not hospitalization, so don’t
drink more than you can handle.
The Basics of Four Essential
Drinking Games

Kings (a.k.a. Circle of Death):

A card game which tends to result in some
sloppy nights out, Kings consists of yourbest
friends and a deck of cards — and some beer
too. This game requires a deck of ‘cards and

at least one beer per person along with one ’

extra beer per round. ,

Place one beer can in the center of a table,
fanning the cards out in a complete circle
around the can. Each player takes turns
drawing a card, announces the number of
the card and then wedges it face up into the
pop tab of the beer in the center.

- Each card has special signiﬁcance:
Two is you: The person who drew the card

‘picks someone to take a gulp of beer.

Three is me: The person who drew the
card takes a gulp of beer. 4

Four is ﬂoor: Whoever is the last to touch
the ﬂoor takes a gulp of beer.

Five is guys: All guys take a gulp of beer.

Six is chicks: All girls take a gulp of
beer. .

Seven is heaven: The last person to raise
a hand in the air takes a gulp of beer.

Eight is date: The person who drew the
card picks another player, who is then forced
to take a gulp every time the person who
drew the card drinks. -

Nine is rhyme: The person who draws
the card picks a word, and moving clock-
wise, each person in turn says a different
word that rhymes with the original. The
ﬁrst person who can’t think of a word takes
a gulp of beer.

10 is categories: The person who drew the
card picks a category —— such as buildings at
Pitt — and moving clockwise, each person
in turn names something in that category.
The ﬁrst person who fails to do so takes a
gulp of beer. _

Jack is “Never have I ever...”: Moving

clockwise, each person lists something he -‘

thinks the others have done, and the ﬁrst
person to have done three listed tasks takes
a gulp of beer.

Queen is question master: The person
who drew the card asks the other players
questions, which they can only reply to in the

. form of another question. Whoever breaks

this rule takes a gulp of beer.

King is rule master: The person who drew V

the card creates a rule. For example, only
use yourleft hand to hold your beer can.
The ﬁrst person to break this rule takes a
gulp of beer.

Ace is the dreaded waterfall: The player

  Detailson drinking games

who drew the card chugs a beer, stopping
whenever he sees ﬁt, while the other players
can only stop chugging once the person to
the left of them has stopped.

The person who forces the pop tab to"

crack open the can of beer chugs the whole
beer, resulting in the end of the game.

Flip Cup:

Teams of equal. numbers stand on either
side of a table, ﬁlling their cups upvto an
agreed upon amount equal in volume to the
person standing across from them. Starting
at one end of the table, the ﬁrst two players

clink their cups together and then chug their -

beers as.quickly as they can.

Once ﬁnished, they place their cups right— .’

side—up at the edge of the table before at-
tempting to use their ﬁngers to ﬂip the cup
so that it lands upside down on the table.
Once accomplished, the next player in line
on that _team performs the same act. The
ﬁrst team to have each playergsuccessfully
complete this task wins.
‘Speed Quarters: ' -

Requiring only a table, beer, two cups_

and two quarters, speed quarters is a good

way to get people to. drink large quantities _

of beer in a short amount of time.

The game starts as two participants. on
opposite sides of the table — each with a cup
in front of them — bounce their quarter off
the table and attempt to land them into their

cups. They can do this as quickly as they’d ‘

like until they are able to perform the task,
sending the cup around the table clockwise
and taking a gulp from their beer as the next
player tries to complete the same feat.

This continues until a person is unable
to bounce a quarter into the cup quickly
enough, eventually getting lapped bythe
person next to him This results in the per-
son chugging the beer for a certain amount
of time, dictated by the other participants.
In elimination speed quarters, this person
is also eliminated from the next round of
play.

Mine Field:

Mine ﬁeld is yet another competitive
drinking game requiring a beer, a quarter
and a cup for each player. The objective of
the game is to get your opponents to drink
as much as possible. '

To achieve this goal, contestants take

turns ﬂicking a quarter, chugging their beer _

for as long as they dare before attempting
to stop the quarter. They can only use only
two ﬁngers, and they can’t knock it.over.
Once accomplished, they pass the quarter
clockwise to the next contestant, who does
the same. .
Once a contestant has ﬁnished his beer,
he waits for an opponent of his choosing to

ﬂick the quarter, slamming his can down .

onto ‘the spinning quarter and forcing the
opponent to take a gulp of beer and spin
again. This can is now a land mine, and if a
quarter hits it while spinning, the contestant
who ﬂicked the quarter must take a gulp of
beer and spin again. I

Pairing up beer and
sporting events

By Michael Macagnone 8: Drew Shull
The Pitt News staff

Sports and beer go together. It doesn’t get
any better than_drinking a. refreshing brew

’ while watching your favorite game.
Nobody wants to drink a beer that doesn’t‘ '

feel right for his or her sport, so after much
debate and hand-wringing,_we’ve come up
with our own guide to sports and beer.

Of course, the options within a stadium
are usually limited, so maybe a quick trip
to a distributor or sports bar can get you
your ﬁx. " -

' Baseball: India Pale Ale

Appreciating baseball can be a tumult of
strong but subtle . sensations: the smell of
fresh cut grass, the perfectly thrown sinker»-
and the crack of an ash bat. A

You’ll never ﬁnd an IPA in a beer bong. It’s
not a beer for chugging — perfect for a sport

that takes its time as well. Take a sip of this ‘

strongly ﬂavored brew while ﬁlling out your
scorecard in the bottom of the third inning,
and you’ll understand what we mean.

Nascar: Icebeer

Nascar has no frills, and neither.does
ice beer.

- To make ice-beer, brewers freeze water
in a lager before separating and siphoning it
off. This leaves a stronger beer without the
pretense-ofwatering it down. It’s perfect for
watching a race on a hot summer day.

Plenty of mass—market breweries offer
this option at a pretty good price, meaning
you can get through all 500 miles of left turns
without breaking the bank.

Soccer: Local brew

Soccer is a global sport, and beer is a
global drink.

The beer you drink at the Old Firm while
singing “The Boys of the Old Brigade” won’t
be the beer you drink at El Clésico while try-
ing to forget Messi almost came up through
Real’s youth system.

‘I So buy a local beer, ﬁnd the supporters’
pub, and singalong. Asjournalists, we hap—J
pen to be partial to the anthem from South
London’s Millwallz '

“No one likes us,

No one likes us,

No one likes us!

And we don’t care.”

Football: American-style
yellow lager,

Football is nothing if not in your face.

Shotgunning a oath, swift way to drink when done righ

By Patrick Wagner
Staﬂ” Writer

With 12 amber ounces ofYueng1ing
in his hand, my father once told
me that opening a beer can wasn’t
always such an easy thing.

Sharp steel church keys were
pressed into the tops of cans to
open them since their introduction
in the 1930s; the easy pull—tabs we
know today weren’t implemented
till the ’60s. Of course, you can still
open a beer with a tool, but this is
usually done for a completely dif-
ferent purpose.

Shotgunning a beer is a way to
quickly drink the canned bever-
age in its entirety. This seemingly
Herculean feat is accomplished by
puncturing a small hole in the bot-
tom of the can’s body and drinking
from it as you pull the main tab and
allow gravity to force the contents
out. This is the same bottleneck
principle involved in beer bongs
and the colorful funnels that ﬁll
many fraternity houses and Face-
book pictures.

Follow these
tips to ensure
that you don’t

ruin the party

whileiyou

attempt to ruin
   yourHver 

Though the process seems pretty easy,
following a few tips can ensure that you
don’t ruin the party while you attempt to
ruin your liver.

As this is an activity best enjoyed with
friends, be mindﬁil of where they are and
how much liquid a punctured beer can might
produce. Kitchens, bathrooms and porches
all make perfect venues as there’s always a
reasonable probability someone is‘ going to
puncture a can wrong and give the whole
party an eau de biére. To that same end,
don’t use beer that might be shaken up — it’s
probably too angry. A

. During preparation, be sure to hold the
can so that the bottom is just slightly pointed
up. This ensures that the can’s air bubble is at

. the point of puncture and thusless likely’ to V

disturb the contents. See above. Also make
sure the can’s pull-tab is oriented in a some-
what ergonomic position so you can pull it
as quickly as possible.

The puncture is key to the whole process
and can be done most effectively with some
thing like a pointed key or a knife. Make sure
to carefully cut into — or stab —— the air

' bubble, making a roughly nickel—sized hole.

Be aware of the sharp aluminum points you

just created. Blood makes a terrible mixer.

From here, the remaining steps are to
return the beer to a vertical position, pop
the pull—tab_ and .enjoy the ride as air ﬁlls
the can and beer ﬁlls your belly. Remember
that the more you struggle to drink it like a
conventional beer,_ the slower it will go.

While the key has long been the tradi-
tional implement of choice, a few new inno-
vations have added safety and convenience
to the practice. A friend of mine uses a de-
vice called “The Shotgun,” which features a
church key-style device to create a perfectly
punctured hole. The leverage provided by

the hard plastic instruments fulcrum en-l

sures a safe and hassle—free opehing. Other

devices resembling pointed keys are also .

available and provide a more traditional
‘experience. '

During the whole process, safety_should
be a priority. Remember, 12 oz. of beer will
take the average person an hour to get out
of his system. Gauge whether consuming
that much liquid —‘— and, more importantly,

, carbonation —— all at once is a good idea and
"always be careful with the pointed imple-

ment you’re making. the hole with. '

That being said, it can be a great competi-
tion between friends to see who chugs the
fastest. Announce it at a party and you’ll
have everyone calling “shotgun.” 

SPIIRTS BEER

FROM PAGE 8

The pace of the sport doesn’t allow for dis-
tractions that might take your eyes off the
action. .

Because of that, the American yellow la-
ger, a thoroughly undistracting brew, lets
you get sloshed without taking your mind
off the game.

These are your Budweisers, Coors and
Millers. On a more local kick, they’re the
Rolling Rocks, Pabst Blue Ribbons and Natu-
ral Lights of the world. Served cold, they give
a refreshing kick to keep you attentive while
the teams battle back and forth.

Hockey: Stout

Perfect for when you’re listening to the
f*cking song. '

Hard—hitting and downright bitter
at times, this is the beer you drink when
you’re trying to sober up from the whiskey

 " . you pounded beforeqthe game. A dark ale,

brown or even blackish, this hefty brew
also gives you plenty of fuel to heckle at all

‘ passersby. , ’
So crack a stout down at the rink, and -
don’t stop sipping until the gloves come

off.
Basketball: Wheat beer

\Smooth and stylish, basketball deserves
a beer that goes down easy.

Drink one of these with the celebrities
sitting courtside while Blake Grifﬁn sends
another poor chump back to the‘ AAU.

When beer is this easy to drink, you‘won’t
have to worry about pulling a LeBron and
choking when you get to the end.

Golf: Irish Red

It’s not as famous as the Emerald Isle’s
other beer of choice, but you need a beer

that you can drink 18 of in a day for four '

days in a row.

That doesn’t mean you should spring for
a Smirnoff Ice: This is a sport for gentlemen
and gentlewomen — except at Augusta Na-
tional, where it’s just for gentlemen.

We don’t always drink beer at sporting
events, but when we do, we make sure it’s
the right one. C I

  Fifteen bomb threats p|aguePitt’s -
campus Thursday, taking total to 126

V The Pitt News_ Staff

General bomb threats once again
targeted campus buildings as 15
buildings were evacuated Thurs-
day. A

The threats on campus, which
started on Feb. 13 with Chevron
Science Center, have since emp-
tied buildings 126 times. Thurs-
day’s threats came in four waves,
ﬁrst targeting dormitories before
emptying academic buildings later
in the afternoon and evening.

Threats at 8 a.m. emptied Litch-
ﬁeld Towers, Bruce Hall, Lbthrop

Hall, Sutherland Hall and Pennsyl-
vania Hall, running up the number
of bomb threat evacuationsthis se-
mester to 118. The count surpassed
the century mark on Wednesday, a
day that saw 12 threats.

On April 5, a threat to Litch-
ﬁeld Towers alone took around
three hours to clear, and on April
11, threats to ﬁve other campus
residence halls were threatened si-
multaneously. It took two and a half
hours to clear all ﬁve buildings.

‘ Freshman Justin Clagg, a resi-

dent at Sutherland Hall, stayed up '

late studying for a physics test. But
the alarms that sounded around 8
a.m. threw his sleep schedule off.

“I only got threehours of sleep
because of it,” Clagg said. “I was
planning on waking up around
twelve.” .

The dorms were reoccupied just
after 9 a.m., about one hour after
the Emergency Notiﬁcation System
alert went out. - — -

Just before 2 p.m., another EN
alert went out informing campus of
a threat to Alumni Hall, which was
cleared about an hour later.

Because of the threat to Alumni

Hall, Clagg’s physics test was can-

celed.
At 4:30 p.m., another set of
bomb threats were received for

Experts define
‘person of interest’

By Gideon Bradshaw
Staﬁ’ Writer

On March 23, when University
spokesman Robert Hill said the
police identiﬁed a “person of inter-
est” for the string of bomb threats
on Pitt’s campus this semester,
many assumed that police were
close to making an arrest.
But legal ex-

legal deﬁnition for what the term
“person of interest” means.

John Burkoff, a professor who
specializes in criminal law at Pitt’s
School of Law, agreed that there is
no technical deﬁnition for “person
of interest.”

“‘Person of interest’ is really a
term of convenience,” Burkoff said.
“It’s not a ‘term of art.’”

Legal professionals use “term

of art” to de-

perts and police
agree that the
term “person of

“Person of

scribe a tech-
nical expres-
sion with a

interest” is not precise mean-
I ’ I ' .

:v3itIll10‘fsl.1}1,sIp1ei)cl:l,’S’   mgHe said au-
despite many thorities may
people associat-  a   say that they
ing the two terms ' n have identi-
as such.   - ﬁed a person

Diane Rich- of interest

ards, spokes-

- John Burkoﬁ

in order to
assure a ner-

woman fo; the
Pittsburgh police
department, said that the term
does not carry an assumption of
guilt.

“A person(s) of interest simply
means that Law Enforcement is
interested in speaking with those
who they feel can assist or provide
information regarding an investi-
gation,” shesajd inan email.

A person of interest does not

carry any direct implication of cul- A

pability without an admission of
guilt or further evidence that links
the individual with the crime.

Tony Gaskew, director of the
criminal justice program at the
University of Pittsburgh’s Bradford
campus, said the term “person of
interest” carries no legal deﬁni-
tion. Police may use the phrase to
identify any individual connected
with a case, such as a possible wit-
ness to a crime or the person they
believe committed the act.

Gaskew emphasized that law
enforcement distinguishes be-
tween a person of interest, which
does not implicate a person direct-
ly in a crime, and the term suspect,
which does.

“If a person has been named a
suspect, there is an assumption of
due process,” he said, adding that
“suspect” refers to a person for
whom law enforcement has prob-
able cause to implicate him or her
of a crime. V

Gaskew added that there is no

vous public
that they are conducting investi-
gations.

Gaskew said that the expression
person of interest became part of
the public vernacular after the
media incorrectly labeled Richard
Jewell as a suspect in the attempted
bombing during the 1996 Atlanta
Summer Olympics.

Gaskew said news channels
and papers -labeled Jewell as a
suspect after the security guard
discovered the bomb planted at
the Olympic site and alerted police
about the threat.‘Jewell, who was
never charged with the crime, later
brought successful lawsuits against
the news organizations that impli-
cated him.

,“Prior to the Richard Jewell
case, the media would often name
a person ofinterest as a suspect,”
Gaskew said, adding that the me-
dia have become more cautious
about using the label, which car-
ries with it a direct link between
an individual and the commission
of a crime.

Like Gaskew, Richard stressed
that while the term appears often,
it should not be taken as a label
of guilt.

“Again, this does not implicate
or tie anyone to a crime until it can
be justly proven that the person(s)
has indeed initiated the crime or
was an accomplice/conspirator in a
crime,” she said in an email. I

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Dispatches from Pitt’s 2016 CMU invasion“

 
 
 

Matt Schaff
Columnist

  

--CLASSIFIED-

April 17, 2016
Dearest Mother and Father,

I received those articles making
specious comparisons betweenusand
the Bush Administration’s Iraq War,
and I know you meant well. But re-'
ally, you’ve got tolstop listening to the

apologist media. Listen to me — shut '

your ears, shut your eyes, shut your
mouth; whatever it takes to prevent
yourselffrom being controlled. Oth-
erwise, yo_u’re un-American.

All these journalists want is for
Chancellor George W. to fail and for
our beloved University to ﬂounder in
its glorious crusade to bring a wave
of Pitt-ocracy to the region. Publish-
ing such fact-based reports that fairly
depict Pitt’s administrative bungling of
the ongoingwar is tantamount to sid-
ingwiththe enemy: the bomb “threat-
enists,” asthey’re now called. Anyone
not with us is, by deﬁnition, against
us ——these‘ despicable truth-tellers are
nothing more than articulate threat-
enist sympathizers.They’relettingthe
threatenistswin. »

We cannot simplywake up tomor— 7

row, as the bloodthirsty journalists
demand, and accept that our inva-
sion has descended into quagmire,

2 TE77 thatitsentthousandsofyoungpeople

into treacherous conditions based
on false pretenses and that it’s pro-
vided an attention diversion allow-
ing University administrators to give
themselves raises, all while sinking
Pitt’s reputation on the international
stage. Collectively taking such a cold
shower of reason is dangerous. The
infallibility of our leader shall not be
compromised —— we need to protect
Pitt pride, after all.

Perhaps some renewed good will
— like the kind we felt in early 2014
— could deﬂect these viciously ac-
curate media attacks. You remember
2014, a short time after Chancellor
W. assumed his current role, when
Pitt buildings sustained their second
round of successive, seemingly endless
bomb threats. Facingthe ﬁrst round in
2012, Chancellor Mark N ordenberg,
father of current Chancellorw. (his full
name is George  Nordenberg, but
he prefers the name “W.”), limited his
approachtotreatingthe “ﬂ1reatenists”

as only a traditional law enforcement
problem. The bomb threats ﬁzzled
eventually, no doubt, but sure enough
they resurfaced two years later, with
faculty schedules compromised and
students evacuated from exam peri-
ods. Itwas thenthatthe sonpromised
toﬁnish the job hisfatherstarted—-to
once andforallnip “threatenism” from
where it had indubitably budded.
That’s why ChancellorVV., miredin
random bomb threats, decided to de-

clare “The War on Threatenism” and

invade Carnegie Mellon University.
Allshades of mud were slungatthe
Chancellor overthis most courageous
decision—you’ve heard the butfoons
in the media. When he could have de-
voted precious focus to hunting down
the real people responsible forterror-
izing the Cathedral of Learning and
Chevron Hall, Chancellor W. thought
it more appropriateto squanderpoliti~
cal capital, institutional values and the
educational experimentby spuriously
directingblame ataregime with tenu-
ous connection to the threatenists, so
they say. When he could have listened
to intelligence reports that CMU en-
gineering students weren’t actually
buildingweapons of mass intimidation
(WMIS), ChancellorW. preferred to en-
casehis ears inRoc’s panther head, so
they say. And when, upon committing
his institution to this course, he could
have allocated the massive resources
truly needed to support the CMU Oc-
cupation, he instead cut tuition, lost

-donors and raised his administrator

buddies’ salaries and beneﬁts, so they
say. But who cares what they say? Re-
member, these Pitt pride-less ingrates
are merely thinkingwith their heads;
our Pitt generation will only achieve
greatness ifwe follow the lead of Chan-
cellorW. and base our understanding
of the world on “gut feelings.”

Here’s one such gut feeling chock-
full of extrapolatory power: Pitt’s

- 21-day .“blitzkrieg” of a post-2014-
'bomb-threats court casewhose ruling

established blue-and-gold hegemony
over Tartan plaid — we sure—as-heck
busted those CMU lawyers’ bunkers
—— was nothing short of awesome.
Therefore, anything Pitt administra-
tors do or say must be similarly awe-

. some—likethe newpolicy, outofthe

“See Something, Frame Someone”
campaign, or the installment of elec-
tronic “Patriot Peepers” in Pitt build-

ings, particularly bathrooms. Armed
with these ubiquitous microphones,

which can recognize “thre'atenist-like”
mutterings the second they fall out of

students’ mouths or other oriﬁces, we
can now valiantly protect our Univer-
sity’s honor by dishonoring our col-
leagues’ privacy rights. A

But as much as we’ve judiciously
put the rights ofPitt students on hold,

discipline and goaltending.

On nine occasions, the Flyers
conceded unnecessary power
plays. The Penguins capitalized
by scoring four of their goals on

due to Ilya Bryzgalov and Sergei

But the Flyers’ goaltending

With the fortunate goal that

Maybe it was the orange T-

that motivated the Penguins. Or
perhaps they were just tired of
getting beaten by the team they
hate the most.

~ Whatever the reason, the play-
ers that we watched on Wednesday
night ﬁnally looked like the Pen-
guins that many analysts picked
to win the Stanley Cup before the

“This has been a really tough

Debating the merits of Oakland vs. South Side bars

Despite living in the same city
for four years, Pitt students hail-
ing from opposite ends of the
state still can’t seem to agree on
certain things — such as which
convenience store is better and
which hockey team deserves to
win the Stanley Cup. But there’s
one question that’s divided people
from both Pittsburgh and Phila-
delphia: Are South Side bar crawls
always preferable to Oakland bar
crawls?

For many Pittsburghers, the
answer is a resounding yes. East
Carson Street, the South Side’s
main thoroughfare, features one
of the longest uninterrupted
stretches of bars in the Untied
States (not to mention a slew of
cheap restaurants and live music

venues). But for the Pitt students ,

who live a mile or so beyond the

Hot Metal Bridge," the question V

seems reasonable. Do the beneﬁts
of making the excursionoutweigh
the costs, or» should Oakland resi-
dents be content with‘ the more
relaxed ambiance of their local
bars?

Proponents of the latter op-

tion would argue that the bars
surrounding Pitt’s campus more
than satisfy students’ needs. And
to a certain extent, they’re right.
Everything from cozy, relaxed

environments to more upscale_

drinking to packed dance halls can
be found within a short walking
distance of the Cathedral; More
importantly, perhaps, bars like
Gene’s Place maintain an intimate
atmosphere that’s all too scarce
on East Carson Street. Although
‘Atwood attracts more than its fair

share of drunks on»Friday night,
there’s no rivaling the belliger-

ent hordes that descend‘ onto the
South Side “come the weekend."
Champions of Pittsburgh’s
version of New York’s East Vil-
lage would note, however,,.that

L for all, its garishnessand excess,

the South Side really does offer‘
something for everyone. If you
can stand the commotion, there’s
nearly no limit to the interest-
ing people and situations you’ll
encounter. And if you don’t like
the bar you visit, you can simply
move next door.

If you’re wearing high heels,

 many people wouldn’t think of

though, that can quickly grow
exhausting. For most Oakland
residents, a night away from home
often entails tramping around in
expensive clothes. Factor in prep-
aration time, and the outing might
soon seem much less enticing.
And perhaps that’s something
every student can agree on. The
South Side is, indisputably, the

ganizing a trip across the bridge
often becomes an ordeal in itself.
Taxi fare is only $10 or so, but

initiating an East Carson Street
bar crawl without dressing up and
pregaming.

When you’re interested in a ca-
sual night out, Oakland bars are an
ideal recourse. But if you’re intent
on making the ‘most’ of your Fri-
day night — if, say, it’s your 21st
birthday or your best friend from
home is visiting for the weekend
— then the South Side is practi-
cally unbeatable. And whichever
neighborhood you choose, please
don’t bring your underage friends
— unless you want to appear in
the police blotter, that is.

Tips for drinking with
sophisticated people

By (fourtney Strauss
Columnist

     

Most of us are all too familiar with
college drinks: Pepsi bottles of
Bankers Club, shot pitchers laced
with gummy worms, $4 double
whiskey and cokes.'_But if you’re
moving away from Oakland this
summer, you’ll need to know how
to behave at upscale bars and res-
taurants.

No one loves a dive bar more
than I do, but last summer I fre-
quently found mys elf in downtown
Pittsburgh at 5:30 p.m. on Thurs
days and Fridays (and sometimes
Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednes-
days) with my coworkers. That
meant I had to put my pinky up
and‘ do some “Sex in the City”-
style drinking. I’d always been an
admirer of martinis A-4 the sexi~
ness of the glass, the sleekness
of the drinkers (James Bond, for
instance.) — and I knew I wanted
vodka with olives and no ice. The
problem was, I didn’t know how
to order it. So when I requested
what I called “an original mar-

ingaiid

tini,” the bartender leaned in and
said, “Let me help you out.” She
told me I needed to order a dry
(extra Vermouth) Grey Goose (my
favorite vodka) martini up (in the
fancy glass with no ice) and olives
(not a lemon twist). You can also
get it dirty (with olive juice, which
I personally hate) or made with gin
(the classic alcohol for the drink).
A Manhattan makes for an equally
upscale drinking experience, as
does a whiskey (particularly if it’s
Maker’s Mark), sweet Vermouth
and bitters mix on the rocks (no
matter how old I am I’ll always
ask bartenders to put extra mara-
schino cherries in mine, the drink’s
signature garnish).

If you’re into sweeter drinks,
I’ve got you covered as well. I’m
sure you’ve heard of the cosmo-
politan —- aka cosmo —'——' ayummy
blend of vodka, triple sec, cran-
berry and lime. Bars will havetheir
own signature martinis as well; I
particularly enjoy the pear one at
Joe Mama’s.

beer kind of night? Needless to ”
say, a Miller Lite or any “Lite”
beer shouldn’t be your ﬁrst choice.
You’re much safer selecting some-
thing like a Sam Adams, Magic Hat
or a local creation like a Pittsburgh-
brewed Penn Pilsner. 

There are ﬁve basic types of
beer: premium imports like Hob-
goblin, microbrews like Dogﬁsh
Head, more common imports like
Stella Artois, what I like to call the
all-American beers like Coors and
kind—of microbrews like Sam Ad-
ams, which are a fancier departure
from the all-American ales. Over
the summer, my coworker gave me
a crash course in beer basics. “The
more bitter and tangy a beer is,”
she said, “the more hops it has.”“’
Pilsners and lagers are the lightest
types of beer, which make them
ideal for people who aren’t big
beer fans.

What about wine? After a few
networking events at The Wine
Loft, I realized I needed to know
more than just the distinction be--
tween “red” or “white” to order

High-quality alcohol encourages moderate drinking  

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Most college students choose their alcohol
using two criteria: cheapness and volume.
The ﬁrst criterion enables the second
— the cheaper the booze, the more you can
obtain. Unfortunately, this mentality is self-
reinforcing. If every keg party serves some
kind of vile “beer,” you begin to think that’s
what alcohol really tastes like. There’s no op-
portunity to discriminate between better and

worse stuff. ,

More importantly, drinking those large
quantities of alcohol can adversely affect
your health and relationships. Consequences

A can range from car accidents to unplanned

pregnancy to cirrhosis.

Of course, the prohibitionist View of beer
as “demon rum” is equally wrong-headed.
Alcohol can make conversation ﬂow more
freely and is thus a valuable social lubricant.
Some of the best conversations I remember
occurred after a glass of wine. And let’s face it,
being buzzed is fun. The key is using alcohol

in moderation. Right around the age of 21 is
the best time to learn this skill. It’s legal to
drink, meaning that there’s no need t6 guzzle
as much alcohol as possible before getting
caught, and you’re still young enough to learn
responsible habits.

A majorway to encourage drinking in mod-
eration is to choose high-quality alcohol. Now,

‘ I don’t want to sound like one of those annoy-

ingwine drinkers who will not consume any-
thing that’s fermented after the Carter admin-
istration or the hipster who drinks only those
beers which are made in three-bottle batches.

I’m also not going to say that expensive stuff
should be the only stuff one drinks, especially
not when I just had a glass of Charles Shaw.
But good alcohol changes one’s perspective on
how the substance should be used.
Generally, good stuff is expensive. This is
not to say that the only good alcohol is expen-
sive orthat more expensive necessarily means
better. But, in general, the higher cost associ-

‘ ated with better booze can discourage heavy

drinking. Better wine and spirits also make the
statement “I’m drinking it for the taste” make
sense: It’s good enough to not be the kind of
thing you would want to slam down.

Given a reasonably good wine or spirit, the
drinker does not want to get drunk as quickly
as possible, as doing so diminishes the overall
experience. When drinking better drinks, the
objective of the drinker changes to enjoying
each sip and wishing that drunkenness did

not occur. This shift in mindset is harder to i

achieve when drinking inferior beer, wine
or liquor. In fact, the only reason for drink-
ing some of the worse stuff is to get drunk.
So if bad stuff is all one drinks, one can be
excused for thinking that’s the only purpose
of drinking. .

4 A good wine, and, more importantly, a
good wine pairing,’also allows one to start
seeing the consumption of alcohol as part of
a larger experience instead of merely an end
in itself. I have had maybe two formal dinners
featuring an aperitif before dinner followed by
wine during and a different wine at dessert,

with the three drinks spaced out across two or A

three hours. A few other dinner planners have

. skipped the dessert wine, but the overall idea \

was the same. Sounds a little old-fashioned,
if not effete, doesn’t it?

Well, sort of. But that still doesn’t detract
from one central fact: Those dinners were
some of me most pleasant I’ve ever had. Good
wine pairings have a nice way of comple-
menting the food, like ketchup has a way of
complementing french fries. Much like too
much ketchup ruins the experience of french
fries, too much wine ruins the experience of
dinner.

It’s also helpful to drink in the occasional
formal setting. Having too much to drink in
front of your in—laws at a restaurant is embar-
rassing. Spilling liquor on your suit jacket is
equally gauche andwill runup the dry-cleaning
bill. Keeping tabs on alcohol consumption is a
good way of getting to know one’s limits and
training oneself to walk that ﬁne line between
buzzed and blitzed. If one decides to drink too
much, it will be a conscious decision rather
than a failure to understand limitations.

Of course, it’s still possible to drink fancier
stuff and end up like F. Scott Fitzgerald or Wil-
liam Faulkner. However, I get the sense that if
a lot of college students were to start drinking
better alcohol, their outlook on drinking— its
costs, its beneﬁts and its function —— would
change in a way that would encourage mod-
eration and responsible use. I

carbs. It’ll take the alcohol longer to pass
through your system when you have food in
your stomach.

A lot of people think it’s a good idea to eat
while drinking to avoid a hangover, but I’m
not one of those people. Eating while out for
the night generally means pizza or some other
form of greasy food, and that’s not good for
your digestion. Grease is hard on your stomach,
and so is alcohol. Pick your poison: You can
choose.either pizza or alcohol, but don’t mix
them. It only hurts more. If you really want to
eat, select something easier to digest. Have
toast, a bowl of cereal orsome macaroni and
cheese. A W .

Drink water -

This is maximally important. The vast ma-
jority of your hangover derives from dehydra-
tion. There are various theories about when to
drink water. One friend tells me to drink two

' glasses of water before bed. Another tells me

to drink a glass of water immediately upon
waking. My mom tells me to drink a glass of
water between each drink. I don’t think any are
wrong. Drinkwater, oryouwillfeel horrible the
next daywhenyourbody realizes you peed out

all its precious nutrients.

Other theorists say that drinking Pedialyte
or Gatorade the next morning works bet-
ter than just plain water. I personally think
Gatorade tastes like sweaty soccer practices

and the ﬂu, so it’s not my preferred method of
hydration. But if it works for you, do it.
. The next day
OK, so you failed. It happens. You wake
up with a pounding headache, an inability to

‘be productive and possibly even the desire to

vomit. Fear not. A hangover is sort of like the
common cold: There’s no cure, so you treat
the symptoms. .

If you have aheadache, poundafew glasses

I of water and see if you feel any better after

about a half hour. Headaches result from de-
hydration, and this should help. If it doesn’t,

pop an ibuprofen.

If you can’t seem to focus or get any work
done, this is likely the result of too little sleep.
Obviously the best cure is a few more hours of
sleep. If you don’t have that kind of time, drink
some coffee. The energy boost should get you

‘ through what you need to accomplish.

If you have the urge to vomit, then you
deﬁnitely drank too much. However, know-
ing this won’t help you feel better. You can
try over-the—counter medicines like Emetrol
or Pepto-Bismol, which might alleviate your
nausea. If you don’t have these medicines on
hand and can’t manage to leave the house, try to '
wait it out. Keep drinking water, and eat some
toast. You can get through this.

Know when to give up ‘ .

There are times when you just can’t defe

2 i
the hangover: When this happens, know when

to give up and sleep it off. Throw your pajamas ‘

back on ’—' or maybe you never changed out of
them —— get into bed and give it a few hours.
You can be productive later. Sometimes you just
need a reminder of what it feels like to drink
way too much. When this happens, try not to
let it happen again. -

As a parting gift, here are some quick—and—
dirty to—don’ts: Don’t drink an entire bottle of
red wine, don’t take antihistamines before go-
ing out and don’tthinkyou’re getting anything
above the bottom shelfwhen you ordera mixed
drink on special at a bar.

Here’s hoping for success in navigating a
hangover—free lifestyle.I ,

with conﬁdence. First, the reds —— zinfandel,
cabernet sauvignon, shiraz and merlot are
more dry, whereas pinot noir, sherry and
port are sweeter. As for the whites, char-
donnay, sauvignon blanc, champagne, rose

' and pinot gris are dry, whereasRiesling and

white zinfandel are relatively sweet. Wine

‘tends to make me sleepy, but if you’re some— '

where like The Loft, ordering a merlot or
Riesling is a safe choice.

What if you’re at a post—work happy hour
or dining out with a grad school professor?
Well, before drinks are ordered you should
discuss whether or not your group wants to
buy in rounds or individually. While rounds

‘C can be fun, everyone at the table trying the .

same drink might not be ﬁnancially feasible.
Remember that bargoers should always tip.
If you didn’t opena tab, tip after each drink
is purchased. If you do open one, leave a 15

percent to 20 percent tip on your total bill. -

Don’t be rude to the bartender or server

by summoning him loudly or addressing ‘

them as “Waiter” or “Sir.” A normal volume
“excuse me” will sufﬁce. ;

Alcohol can’ be delightful in itself, as
long as it’s enjoyed responsibly, but it can
also facilitate a great deal of networking
and socializing — you’d be surprised at the
connections you can make over a nice pinot
grigio. Don’t be overwhelmed by the real-
world bar scene. Conﬁdence is key. Order
and sip your drink with assurance, and you’ll
be the coolest cat in the club.‘
