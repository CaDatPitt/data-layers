SG Votes Adjournment,
Studies Special Ramps

By JOSEY GROSSMAN -

Student Government voted Monday to adjourn until
February 26 when they will meet to handle any matters that
come up before the March 7 election.

Dave Menzer, chairman of the elections committee, re-
ported that undergraduates cast 290 votes for the Repre-
sentative’s Plan, 258 votes for dissolving SG, 170 votes for

the President’s Plan, and 26 votes.

for no change in the present sys-
tem. The Senate granted Menzer’s
committee full power to run the
March elections for new SG ex-
ecutive ofﬁcers and representa-
tives.

Claude Lair told the Senate
that he and his committee had
spoken to Dr. Thompson of the
Health Service about providing a
ramp on the SU steps for dis-
abled students. Thompson report-
ed that an administrative com-
mittee had already discussed the

.matter and planned to install a

ramp, costing between $2,000 and
$3,000, by the fall of 1962.
“ Ramp Needed
According to the administrative
committee, there is a’ deﬁnite need
for such a ramp with the increas-
ing admission of disabled stu-
dents.
The ‘senators also discussed
a temporary solution for the
problem. They decided to send
4 letter to the administrative
committee, headed by Dr. Jack
Birch, suggesting that a temp-
orary signaling device such as
a bell be installed at a mini-
mum cost. The signal would
alert the SU desk to send out
someone to help the disabled
students up the steps.
From interviews with and let-
ters from handicapped students,

Lair concluded that the main
problem is -the Schenley Hall
steps. “When the students come

‘back from the library at night, .

they might have to wait 10 to 15
minutes before someone comes
along to help them up the steps.
This isn’t bad in warm weather,
but in the winter it’s hard.”

Another problem exists at the
side entrance to the Cathedral.
‘Here, too, the students in wheel-
chairs have to wait a long time
at night before someone comes to
help them,’ Lair said.

District Executives"

T 0 Counsel Students

The Society for the Advancement of Management has
announced a Careers Counseling Program during the month
of February to give students career information and oppor-
tunity to meet and converse with executives. The program
is operated by the Professional Chapter of the Society.

Forty-ﬁve management executives from twenty-three

well lnmown Pittsburgh corpora-9

tions are acting as counselors to
undergraduates for the month.
Paul Preston, the Professional
Chapter Counseling coordinator
announced that the counseling
was available for all Liberal Arts,
Business Administration and En-
gineering students who are in-

? terested.

The 45 S.A.1\/I. execs are from
companies in the rxrea such as
ALCOA, H. J. Heinz, Jones and
Laughljn Steel, Mine Safety Ap-
pliances, Pittsburgh Plate Glass,
and Westinghouse. They seek to
strengthen the profession by help-
ing students to select the best ca-
reer for their future.

Counseling Offered

The program is made available
to all so that students can become
acquainted with the activities of
S.A.M. and gain accurate and di-
rect information on conditions in
various ﬁelds. Couseling offers ex-
perience in the art of meeting and
conversing with executives to the
student.

s.A.M. stresses that this is

not a. placement programv but
that good business contacts can
aid in future placement. Coun-
colors are available on a first
come first served basis. It the
student has a preference he is

requested to register early for
the program.

Applications for the program
are available in 317 SU. Jim
Zetwo is campus president of the
organization and can supply fur-
‘the details. S.A.M. requests that
students have some pertinent
questions for their first interview

as this is not a lecture program.

ri-Term Plan

By TOM. BRYANT
The University administration and student body are
playing an important role in the modernization of the Flor-
ida state educational system. Beginning next September, all
state-operated colleges and universities will shift to the tri-

mester calendar, pioneered by
According to the January

the University of Pittsburgh.
28 issue of the Miami Herald,

the Florida State Cabinet hase
unanimously approved the switch

from the former semester plan to
a modiﬁed three-term plan.

The Florida trimester will differ
from its Pittsburgh counterpart
during the spring term. Sessions
beginning April 10 and continuing
through August 10 will be “split,”
giving students the opportunity of
going to school all summer or se-
lecting either the first or second
half of the term. The second half
begins June 20. ‘

Teachers to Attend

The Florida Board of Control
believes that teachers will still at-
tend college during the latter half
of the summer term, following the
close of public schools. Students
_can also elect two and one-half
trimesters each year, enabling
them to complete their schooling
in less than four years. ‘

The June 20 “split” will also
permit students working their
way through college to secure
summer employment yet inc-
rease their progress through
school.

istrators have acted as advisors

cision to adopt the trimester.

the University forwarded trimes-
ter data to Dr. W. Hugh Stickler,
director of institutional research

The Florida educators feel
that the main advantage of the
trimester is the shorter period
required to obtain a Bachelor's
degree in arts or sciences and
secondarily, a Christmas vaca-
tion “free from worry over ﬁnal
examinations.”

Florida governor Farris Bryant
has said he “would wait awhile
before giving the plan a full bless-
ing.” He added that he wanted to
be sure that the trimester is a
“true” year ’round calendar and
that the state has enough money
for the necessary pay raise for
teachers.

 Author Creates Vvorld

 

Review of ‘Death of Ahashuerus’

 

j sored by the Nationality Council

Of Haunted

  Individuals

By INA AMDUR

Every author creates his

own universe, perfectly dis-

tinguishable from that of any other writer’s because each
author has his own unique vision of the world which can-
not be duplicated. Par Lagerkvist, a Swedish Nobel Prize
winner, has just added another fragment to his own universe
in “The Death of Ahashuerus (Random House, 118 pp.)

In “Bar_abb‘asi” and his other?

novels, Lagekvist’s We1tanschau-
ung is unmistakable. He peoples
his world w-ith men haunted and
tortured by God and the meaning
of life. Lagerkvist’s"ﬁctional uni-
verse goes beyond realism his is
a religious and surrealistic view
of man. A ~~

The ultimate concern of Lagerk-
vist’s characters is to ﬁnd salva-
tion. whether it be secular or re-
ligious, and to understand the
meaning of existence.

Suffers Eternal Life

Asashuerus, in the title of the
book, is the Wandering Jew, the
mythical ﬁgure who did not let
Christ lean on his house on the
way to Calvary. Christ punished
him by saying, “Tarry thou, ’till

I return,” thereby condemning
him to eternal life.
In this novel Ahashuerus

makes the acquantance of a
group of pilgrims going toward
the Holy Land. One of them,
Tobias, is not a believer but is
strangely haunted by the ﬁgure
of a dead woman with a stig-
mata, whom he saw frozen to
death in a cabin. He buried her,
and decided for her sake to go
to the Holy Land.

Diana, another of the ‘pilgrims,
is the lover of Tobias and was
also the mistress of ,a band of
robbers with which Tobias was
formerly associated. The three of
them set out to the Holy Land
by themselves, but never get there
for different reasons.

Actually do Arrive
However, perhaps in another
sense, they do arrive at the Holy
Land. Ashashuerus says at one
point that for him the Holy Land
is death, the death which was
denied him by Christ. Diana dies
more beautifully than she lived,
and Tobias himself, we are led to
believe, has ﬁnally decided that
he is a true pilgrim, although he
will never reach his destination.
Lagerkvist’s excellence is not
in his plot, but in his por-
trayals of tormented religious
consciousness. The important.
events in the novel. which can-
not be summarized, are Ahash-

uerus’ inner monologue with
God; Tobias’ ﬁghts with himself;
and Diana’s desperate nihilism
and untimely sacriﬁcial death.
This book, as all of Lagerkvists,

‘retains a mythical quality because
‘neither the characters, the events,

nor the places are particularized
with names or dates. Although all
of the characters have names,
they are symbolic ones and only
add to the timeless sense which
Lagerkvist achieves.

Those who insist on a kind of
secular realism ‘in the novel. will
probably not like the dimly out-
lined characters Lagerkvist
creates. While their sufferings are
real, one cannot say that one
knows Tobias, Diana, or Ashash-
uerus.

Those who can accept Lagerk-
vist"s world and those who can
enter into the novel as concerned
participants will find that their
own view of the world has been
enlarged after reading “The
Death of Ahashuerus.”

  Tiglzt Schedule.

“Each trimester is the equivalent, academically, of the
traditional semester; it is not a variation of the quarter
system.” This is the story the University Bulletin tells,
but one look at the spring time schedule gives quite a dif-
ferent picture.

Despite constant reminders that students should‘ plan

C their spring curricula just as they would the fall and win-

; . terterms, the latest time schedule shows a decided cut in

..‘.

\

the number of courses offered these students.
In English alone, of the 31 different courses offered
‘thisterm,’ 13 of them‘ have- been dropped from,the spring

' roster. In history only seven of the 23 winter courses plus
history courses offered from A

three additions total ten
April to August. ‘
Math has suffered a similar loss. From a choice of 19

/

‘f courses in the winter, the spring student now has an op-

portunity to selectifrom eight courses. And History of
Religion has disappeared altogether.

iiOf course, it is important to consider the type of course 3

remaining. For the beginning college algebra student or
the basic math enthusiast, the ﬁeld is a gold mine. But
for the math major who not only desires a more advanc-
ed curriculum, but must also fulﬁll particular advanced
“courses in order to graduate, the spring term ‘offers little

, incentive to attend. A large number of courses inall cur-

ricula rank below the 100 level. ,r
If the spring trimester equals each other term it should
present the same opportunities for an education as its fall
and winter counterparts. I
Two possible arguments present themselves at this

. time. (Many of the teaching faculty will not or cannot re-

main for the spring term. In addition, the risk of main-

taining a faculty member who might teach just one or

two students is not economically sound. , ..

As for the student, he could alleviate much of the con-
ﬁusion by arranging his schedule so that requirements can
be taken in the fall and winter terms. But a student must

I plan his curriculum for the winter term in mid-November
-four months before the spring schedule is available. How
is he to know what courses will be offered in the summer?

If this University plans to maintainia year-round pro-
gram, it should offer a comprehensive curriculum to ac-

company it. The spring trimester must become more than

Letters
Student Decries,
‘Jim. Crow’ incident

Editor, The Pitt News:

Is it possible that Jim Crow is
still alive in this city, no- less at
this University? A friend of mine
witnessed an incident at our Book

Center which deserves some ex- ‘

planation. Three Negro boys, aged
perhaps 12 qr 13, ' were a ejected
from the inner part of the store
by a cane-welding, towering white
man. i '
The excuse given was thattchi1-
dren are not allowed in without
their parents. If this is true, why

. weren’t the boys turned back by

the‘ guide or by one of the check-
ers?
If this is‘ the store’s policy,‘ why

is there no sign in Vront to save A

young, would—be customers from
embarrassment? And ﬁnally, if
this is true, why was my 10-year-
o1d,\white sister allowed to come
in alone, wander about the store,
and make a purchase for me‘?

Why, at a time when Pitt, one
of the up-and-coming institutions,
is tryinglto build a good national
and even international reputation,
does aparadox like this have to
arise? Right-thinking "Pitt stu-
dents deserve an explanation.

Mary L. Rubin

Editor’s Note: Informed of the
preceding letter, Paul Boltacz,
General Manager of the Univer-
sity Bookstore, replied that he
was complying with a policy set
by Frick and other local grade
schools which asks that he ex-
clude children of grade school age
not accompanied by an adult.

He regretted that the incident
involved Negro boys" and said
that he has asked» many children,
Negro and White, to enter the
store only with an adult.

Duke Sports Editor
Answers O'Brien

Editor, The Pitt News:

If not entirely factual or logic-
al, your sports edit-or’s column
about the Duquesne Dukes which
appeared in the February 5 issue
of The,Pitt News was interesting.

Mr. O’Brien" opened that *par-

 

. ticular column on the artiﬁcial

theme that Duquesne teams‘ are,
suffering from a persecution cem-
plex. To justify this ‘persecution”
viewpoint, I" he», related a

and the Iron Dukes, with the tale

hingipg on an allegedquote by

Becker. / A -
First off, Mr. Becker states that

the Duke persecution’ complex ac-

cusation is a new wrinkle to him
Secondly, Mr. O’Brien reported
that the Iron Dukes were made
up of a Protestant and four Jews.
Actually, the team was comprised
of‘ a protestant, a Jew, two Cath-

‘ olics and one Greek Orthodox.

To make matters more confus-
ing, Mr. O’Brien says that whether
the story is folklore or not doesn’t
matter since it still “serves to ill-
ustrate the persecution complex

that has riddled Duquesne teams.” .

“Doesn’t matter???” Either O’-
Brien has trouble with logic or
he’s trying to snow someone ! That
Iron Duke story was the only
thing on which he based his en-
tire argument. ’

What I am really curious about,
however, is are your s.tudentsNso
apathetic -about the Pitt Sports
program that they would rather
read about Duquesne sports, or is
it just Mr. O’Brien’s personal
writing preference???

African Mobilization

By Traore' D. Mory

Questions asked of foreigners from underdeveloped. countries I
(I would say “non-developed countries”) often have this in common: V
either they reflect certain misconceptions, or they reveal’ a certain’:
' attitude of condescenion. In regard to Africa, the questions are g
usually oriented toward pointing out'the gap between "civilized and 

industrialized Europe 0r,AmeTiC3 alld lUn81€-C0V-
ered, tribal Africa on the other. ‘

Those persons who insist upon questions of
an ironical nature are lacking in intellectual mod-
esty and need not be taken seriously. But there are
others who have gross misconceptions about Africa.
I would attribute these misconceptions to the grave
error they have in believing that Europe and Amer-
ica alone possess a civilization and that any other
way of life is necessarily backward. This concept 4
of civilization is completely false because it is .
based upon the technicl aand ‘scientiﬁc level ‘of ,
the so-called developed c0untI"ieS- ’

Science and technology may well be parts of the culture of a.

 

country but they are not the complete culture. In fact, it would.  

dangerous to use these two elements as the only criteria in a value

judgment. The scientiﬁc and technological level of the United States

is logically explainable both historically and geographically. I it
Itis explainable historically because any country that has been

independent for more than two centuries, provided with immense_ < «

natural resources which are not the product of any intellectual ca-
pacity and beneﬁtting from the scientiﬁc knowledge which is the
result of the scientiﬁclknowleclge which ignores differences in‘ races
and civilizations, is capable of developing to its fullest._ The Soviet
Union, which before‘ 19.17 lived on primary commerce of woodand
furs, has managed to carve for herself in less than 50 years and by
way of revolution, an enviable position. ‘ l I \
Creates for Necessity

It is explainable geographically because man often does not
create out of desire for luxury, but rather through necessity. In
fact, man’s survival in Siberia meant the creation of appropriate
means of heating. It would be ridiculous in Africa to install heating
systems in houses where the thermometer registers 70 degrees.

If Africa does not have what Europe or America has, it is simply
because she has not wanted to create what she did not need; If

‘ Africa is today non-developed, -it is because ,her road toward full

development has been hindered by colonial powers. It is needless
to show to what degree this colonialism has deprived Africa of her
natural and human resources. Therefore, today, as we are liberating
ourselves, ‘we are not so much concerned about complexes, but
rather about creating conditions for rapid development. This is the
meaning of African mobilization. Indeed, the African man intends
to reintegrate universal society by means which channel all his
energy and all his capacity toward superior objectives which are

‘ common to the community of conscious people's. '

There is fear that communism may make inroads into Africa

‘and that certain countries are -falling under dictatorship. If com-

munism and the loss of individualliberties do, -indeed, pose a threat,

'1 would say that. we are unaware of their existence for there is a

greater threat: the exploitation and inhuman repressions of the
colonialists. In factgcontrary to the traditional Western concept of
liberty, the individual in Africa cannot‘ consider his personal liberty
before that of his society. His liberty depends essen_tially on the.
liberty that his society has in relation to the community of nations.
Besides, it is hard to conceive of a FREE individual in an EN-
SLAVED society. .
Let us take this example and suppose that my friend Jerry
(an African), is in jail (his society, a colony). Jerry does not con-
sider his right to walk around his jail as liberty. But he does con-

‘V siderxhis liberty in relation to the exterior world; and,’ obviously,

{

he feels himself a prisoner. Jerry cannot be free so long as his
society is not.‘ This is why we consider as our primary objective
the liberation of our societies from foreign domination.‘ The inde-
pendence accorded to various African countries must not be con-
sidered as an end’ in itself, but rather’ as a step toward the fulﬁll-
ment of a greater objective: the complete liberation of the African
continent. _ —
Dedicai-ed i-o Liberation , e

The African ‘people are entirely dedicated to this liberation
upon which the liberty and security of peach African state depends.
In fact, the following quotation from a speech by President Sekou
Tour illustrates better than any other example the indivisibility of
the African continent: “We are conscious that, so ‘long as the whole
of Africa is not liberated, Guinea will feel itself threatened. It is
exactly as if one took the image of a_man with a wound infhis
finger: the ﬁnger itself does not feel the pain, if there is pain, but
it is the entire body of the man that registers it. Guinea registers
the pain of the colonized people of Africa.” \ '

It is for this basic liberty that we are mobilizing. We cannot
consider the Cold War when we have a Hot War at home. Algeria
is in ﬂames, the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Guinea are sub-
jected to the most inhuman atrocities and the French government

"deﬁes an entire continent by making atomic experiments in the in-
.hab1ted region of Reggane.‘*The challenge of colonialism is too great

for the Africans ‘E0 ignore in order to occupy themselves with
imaginary dangers‘. We are entirely conscious of our true problems
and no intimidating maneuver on the part of the colonialists will be
ableto stop Africa-’s irresistible march toward liberation.

Limited Government, Free Market . . .
Conserva tives
Seeklndividualism

By STAN STEIN
“We believe in individualism.
We believe that only through the
practices of limited government
and a free market economy can
our liberty be preserved. We think
it important that these ideas be
recognized by the campus commu-

nity.” ‘
With. this statement the presi-
dent of the Conservative Study

Group, Jesse Kasowitz, summed

up the basic tenents of the study
group and of the conservative
movement in America. ‘
The group, little more than a
year old, has operated informally
since its conception' but,

sures, has drawn up a‘ constitu-
tion and is now trying to gain of-
ficial recognition as a campus or-
genization.
Not an ‘Action’ Group

The function of the? group, ac-
cording to Kasowitz, is educa-
tional. It is not an action group
as is the .Young Republicans or
Young Democrats, but it simply
tries to present/the ideas and phi-
losophy of Conservatism to Uni-
versity students. ‘

In the past, the group has

. sponsored a lecture forum, and

has, presented such speakers as
Russel Kirk, William F. Buck-
ley, Frederick Hayek, and Frank
S. Meyers. They have held dis-
cussion groups in which they
have discussed current events
and topics of current interest.
They have held study groups in
which they have examined the
works of Edmund Burke, Buck-
ley, Hayek and others. And
they have broadcast their views
in speeches presented over
WPGH. «

The group itself is composed of
15 members. They have no na-
tional affiliations, although they
receive literature from the Inter-
collegiate Society or Individualists
and some of their members are
also members of the Young Amer-
icans for Freedom. The group has
no practical function in that it
does not campaign actively during
election years, and it is, thus far,
li.mited in scope to the University
campus. ' T

Interest Through Reading —

Kasowitz, an arts senior major-
ing in political science for pre-
law, first became interested in the
conservative movement last year
through friends on other cam-
puses and through the books that
he has read on conservatism. Since
then he has been the major work-
horse for. the organization, plan-
ning the discussio.n sessions and
negotiating for speakers to appear
at the lecture forums.

In justifying the incongruity
between students’ usual trend to
liberalism and their growing,
acceptance of conservatism.
Kasowitz stated that the con-
servative movement is a “reac-
tion to the liberal bias being
presented in classrooms and in
textebooks.”

“The liberal bias isn’t objec-
tive,” Kasowitz said. “The con-
servative movement is an import-
ant trend trying to revive some
of the values that students seem
to have forgotten in their search
for a better lif:.”

Went Inactive
Kasowitz, who went inactive

Stop at the S. . . ’

suc- »
cumbing ‘to administrative pres-‘

from Phi Epsilon Pi Fraternity
two years ago, is also the presi-
dent of the Jazz Club, Program-
ming Director for the John Mar-
shall Society, vice-president of the
International, Relations Club, and
a member of. the University of
Pittsburgh Marching band in
which he plays the drums.

He stressed the fact that
though the members of the study
group believe, basically, in the
same thing, the group does not
decide deﬁnite. group policies.
In general, however, the mem-
bers of the group see no pur-
pose in Student SANE, they feel
that the new Marxist Discussion
Group is a good thing as long
as it remains a basically educa-
tinal and inactive organization,’
and they accept, or at least tol-
erate, the views of the John
Birch Society.

Kasowitz also stressed that not

all the members of the group were
convinced conservatives and that
the meetings and lectures are open
to anybody.

Looks to Future V

In looking forward to the fu-
ture, Kasowitz stated that the
group will continuethe lecture se-
ries, possibly presenting John Dos
Passes, Ludwig Von Mises, and
Barry Goldwater. They will also
continue the discussion and study
groups, and they will, if possible,
continue to speak over WPGH.

There are new plans, how-
ever, Kasowitz mentioned. The
group is planning to begin pub-
lication of a periodical which
will set forth the beliefs of the
conservatives and which will
be sent "to other campuses
around the country. The funds
for this publication will be de-
rived, for the most part from
public contribution. Kasowitz.
in conjunction with Martin Lan-
dy, is also planning to begin a
political forum which will be
open to anyone.

At present, the group is,ope.r-
ating informally with the Student
Union as headquarers, but they
hope that they will be able to
move into a new office after they
are otiicially recognized. A

LAUS REX

Greatness lies not In being strong, but in the rigtht using of strength.
' -—-H. .W. Beecher

This Saturday Wrestling Coach Rex Peery will seek his

centennial win against -Lehigh, the second-best wrestling
team in the country, at the Field House at 8pm.

The human heifer smiles with intoxicating good na-

ture when he dwells on the idea. “It sure will be nice to
win,” he said. “Mum sure will be tickled pink.”

“Mum” is Peery’s tiny ‘wife, the‘ little woman who has been de- ~

ciphering telephone calls for 13 years whenpRex is on the road with
his Pitt matmen. “He always shouts himself hoarse,” ‘Mum’ said.

“I

can hardly hear him.”

«.5 Doesn't .Lose. Mum

But the raspy whisperings that Mum strains to hear, have_been_
on the happy side in most cases, for Peery‘ seldom calls home about

a loss. He doesn't avoid phone boothssin ‘disgust; he just doesn’t lose
too often. '

Rex -Peery two losses. _

He learned well too, for his own coach was as competent as
they ever come in the! sport. Edward Clark Gallagher’s teams
won 70 consecutive meets from 1921 to 1932. They also won 11
of the 13 national championships contested from 1928 to 1940.
Peery inherited the winning habit. He was going to need it
when he later came to Pitt.

Peery spruced up on his tactics, coaching high schools in. Okla-

recommended him to Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, who wanted

reactivate the sport at the University of Pittsburgh.

The sport was born at Pitt in 1914. The Panthers lost their first
outing, 4-3, to Lafayette, and that was the closest they ever came to
 winning for quite some time. They lost to the likes of MIT and

Johns Hopkins. V
Jock Couldn't Even Help

Even the presence ofpa heavyweight with a heavier Scottish
brogue named Jock Sutherland couldn’t keep the neophytes from
losing 12 matches with nary a win. The sport was dropped from

the program in 1917.

A The mat sport wouldn’t stay pinned. Pitt tried again in 1935,
but 17‘ straight losses dampened their pioneering spirits once
again. Then Peery came along‘. He wasn’t an overnight miracle
worker either. His first team recorded an 0-10 mark.

A His curtain lecture was worth all the sermons in the world for
teaching the virtues of patience and long—suffering endured during

his ﬁrst year.

Peery teaches wrestling the way they teach chemistry or eco-~
nomics —- no nonsense. His wrestlers give him their undivided atten-
tion, no gawking, no wisecracking. He teaches them more than
i"“'V§j_‘cechniques. He conditions men mentally. He. toughe-US _them-

From him they have learned the joy of terse, even bitter, com-
petition in practice as well as in meets. He has hun

“They eat lettuce and steak,” Peery says. “They (10 What
other people call making sacriﬁces. That is, they get big helpmgs

Peery has a private battle‘ with the paunch, and he -joins in with

Peery’s success is due to sweat. And his wrestlers are
constantly reminded of the message which Rex first greeted his
initial Pitt team with: “I want no one who is satisﬁed with
mediocrity.”

When his boys go out on the mat against Lehigh this Saturday
 they should think of another of his favorite expressions: “The true

For the second consecutive week, the Panther swim-
ming team will be performing in enemy waters.‘This week
the Cats will travel south as they meet Washington and
Leeon Friday, and the Tarheels of North Carolina State
the following afternoon.

The Panthers will try "to

on Friday after their loss to Syr- v
acuse last week. Although not too
much is known about the Wash-
ington and Lee squad they can
be expected to give the Cats a
tough time. ‘A

“Anytime you swim in your
opponent’s pool you -have to ex-
pect "trouble,” commented Pitt
swimming Coach Ben Grady,
earlier this year. “The home team
always has the advantage, and
even poorer teams are likely to

pin last year. Augie scored a
reversal with 36 seconds to go,
and got an additional point for
riding time to win 4-2 over the
ACC’s outstanding wrestler.

In the 177-pound pairing Ken
Barr was scored upon for the first
time in ﬁve‘ meets, when Bill
Nishell managed an escape while
losing 4-1., In the heavyweight
match, Tom Jeffries overcame a
55 pound weight advantage ‘to
best Roger Schoals, 4-3.

Three efﬁicient Panthers, Rich .
Martin, Daryl Kelvington and
Jim Harrison, scored shutouts as
the team breezed to its sixth
straight win. John Zolikoff prepp-
ped for his scrap with the Engi-
neers, winning easily, 7-1.

On Saturday, the Panthers
will play their last game away
from home when they visit a
revenge - minded Westminster
quintet. The last time~the two
teams met, the Cats knocked the
Titans from the ranks of the un-
beaten with a 58-45 upset.

Coach Buzz Ridl’s squad is again
among the top ﬁve small schools
_in the country despite having also
-lost a game to St. Francis’ of
Pennsylvania. They are still‘ being
led by their Little All-American
Ron Galbreath, who was‘ shut off
when he came to the Field House.

The boy who impressed Pitt
fans most, however, was Warren
Sallade who popped in 10 points
and grabbed the sam. number of
rebounds. Because the Titans will
be up for the game and have a
home court advantage, the Pan-
thers will have to put out their
best effort. I

Grady.

Seek Revenge

On Saturday the Panthers will
be seeking revenge against North
Carolina State. Last year, the Tar-
heels were one of the three teams
to defeat the Cats, but this time
the Pitt squad should prove to be
stronger because of the addition
of many valuable sophomores.

In spite of their recent loss at
Syracuse, the Panthers continue
their onslaught against the record
books. ,

Steve Ganong cracked the
record in the 440 yard free
style event last week, lowering‘
the mark to 4:49.23. Ganong pre-.
viously had set the old record
along with the 220 mark against
NYU. ‘

Earlier this season, Rob and
Ron Levine and Dennis McHugh
got into the ..act setting new rec-
ords in the 200 back stroke, the
200 yard butterﬂy, 200 yard in- 1
dividual medley, and 200 breast

view a Pitt wrestling match. _
not appeared at such wrestling hotbeds as Lehigh and Penn
State they could not be blamed for suilering from stage

fright, since they generally perform before crowds of less
than 1000 on their home grounds.‘
The reason for the march on the how he is doing it vet he 35, am;

Field House is the match between
the Panthers and Lehigh. In addi-
tion to the small but faithful
corps that attend all matches the
crowd will be augmented. by many
Lehigh alumni and students plus
a group of people who will be at-
tracted by the publiclty the match
has been given.

One word of caution for every-

gone in attendance. Don’t try to

duplicate the display of unsports-
manlike conduct the good people
of Bethlehem put on last year.
"Not only did they throw paper
cups and the like on the mat, but
they even booed Larry Lauchle

‘after he won‘the Eastern 130
pound title.
Show Class

The basketball fans of Phila-

delphia ‘proved that two such
wrongs don’t make a right during
the recent Duquesne-Villanova
game. Letus proﬁt by it, and show
that we are strictly class.
’ The match itself should be
extremely close. It could, and
probably ‘will not, be decided
until the ﬁnal match. Here’s the
way the teams should lineup,
plus a few comments.

123 pounds -— Rich Martin vs.
Bill ll/Ierriam. Merriam is one ‘of
the better lightweights in the
East. Martin is the best.

136 Pounds — Sherm Moyer
vs. Doug Baillie or Pat Smartt.
Baillie is a two time Eastern
third place ﬁinisher and Smartt
has been good enough to keep
him on the bench most of year.
Moyer’s showing at Navy gives
hope.

T137 Pounds—John Zolikoff vs.
Curt Alexander. Alexander is
good enough to have tied Daryl
Kelvington.the past two years.
Zolikoff’s drop in weight isheld
in awe by wrestling experts, in-
cluding Rex Peery. They can’t see’

it =l- =: .

(‘Mighty Mite” SUCCESSOR—
Rich Martin, 123 pounder, is un-
defeated in seven meets this year,
and has a lifetime chart at Pitt
of 37-3. He is the finest light-
weight wrestler at the school since
Olympian Larry Lauchle grad-
uated last year. Lauchle was an
Eastern chamPi0n 3‘? 130
pounds. , _
Martin is still unbeaten in reg’-
ular competition, losing twice in
the NCAA tourney and once in the
ﬁnals of the Easterns. The, wrest-
ling team haslost only four times
since Martin has been on the team.

weight advantage was the differ-
ence. What‘the losspof poundage
will do to him will be determin-
ed Saturday and will likely de-
termine the outcome of the match.
A toss-up.

177 Pounds -— Ken Barr vs.

Jim Detrixhe. Barr has an im-

pressive, record against average
competition. Detrixhe, an Eastern
champion, has an excellent rec-
ord against excellent competition.
Barr had better stay off his back.
against this fine pinner.

191’ Pounds - Tom Jeffries vs.
Chuck Moore. Moore was good
enough to take a second in the
1961 Easterns at heavyweight.
The drop in weight should help
him. Yet, when Syracuse coach
Joe Scanduraw as asked to com-
pare the two, he said, “There is
no comparison! Moore is noth-
ing!” Scandura is a smart man.

Heavyweight —- Jeff Ware vs.
John Burns. Probably the two
weakest men on each squad. An-
other toss-up. ’

The 167 pound match appears
to be the key bout. If Angeli wins,
this should give Lehigh a 4-3

ﬁnal two matches. They would
need only one more win and
could probably get it by insert-
ing Moore at Heavyweight against
Ware and semi-concede at 191

If Harrison defeats Angell the
Panthers should be on their way
to a win. And tears would flow
for another year in the Lehigh
Valley.

Don’t boo no matter what,
however, for the quality of mercy

There is good reason for the
match between the two Eastern
powerhouses drawing so much at-
tention. Lehigh has an 3-0 record

and is currently ranked second in
the country while the Panthers
stand at 6-0-1 and are fourth in
the nation. 
Not only will the honor of be-
ing the top team in the East rest
on the outcome, but the winner
will also be, in "a strong position
to challenge powerful Oklahoma
State for the number one spot in
the polls.
Point for Match

Both teams have been_ point-
ing for this match all season, but
Lehigh has an added incentive to
win. Last year the Panthers
knocked the Engineers from the

, : ranks of the" unbeaten, and they
 nor the wrestling mad people of
T Bethlehem, Pa., have forgotten.

Lehigh will send just about .

the same team onto the mat
that they used last year. One
notable exception is Thad Turn-
er, an Eastern champion at 167
pounds. His place, due to drops
in weight by several wrestlers,
will be taken by heavyweight
John Burns.

Lehigh lineup will be the inser-
tion of Bill Merriam at 123 pounds
in place of Pat Smartt. Smartt or
Doug Baillie will be at 130 pounds.
The rest of the lineup includes,
Curt Alexander, 137, Pete Gratto
or Doug Koch, 147, Kirk Pendle-

Detrixhe, 177, Chuck Moore, 191
and Burns.

Same Lineup

Rex Peery’ will counter with the
same lineup he has been using‘ all
season, Rich Martin, Sherm Moy-
er, John Zolikoff, Daryl Kelving-
ton, Augie Arrigone, Jim'Harrison,
Ken Barr, Tom Jeﬁries and Jeff
Ware.

The match, like last season’s
encounter, should be extremely
close. Like -last year, it could
go down to the last match. Pitt
appears to have favorites at 123,
.137, 147 and 191 pounds.
Lehigh can look for wins at
130, 157 and 177 pounds. Both the
167 pound and/heavyweight divis-
ions are tossups and the winner
of these two matches will likely
take the meet.
It will take an outstanding nine
man performance to pull off a Pitt
win. The Panthers are capable of
this and a win on Saturday will
not be the upset "hat it was last
year.

THE MANY LOVES OF
THORWALD DOCKSTADER

When Thorwald Dockstader—sopllomol'e, epicure, and sports-
ma.n—-ﬁrst took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarett-es that came, to hand. He did what any
sophomore, epicure, and sportsman would do: be sampled sev-
eral brands until he found the very be.st~a-mild, rich, ﬂavorful
smoke-—an endless source of coml'ort and satisfactioll——a smoke
that never palled, never failed to plea.s'e-—a smoke‘ rthat age
could not wither nor custom sta.le-a ﬁlter cig'a1'ettc with an
unﬁltered taste -—3sIarlbol'o, of course! "
Silnilarly, when Thorwald took up girls, he did not simply
select the first one who came along. He sampled. First he
dated an English litel'atul‘c major named Elizabeth Barrett
Scllwzlrtz, a wisp of a girl with large, luminous eyes and a soul .
that sllimlnered with a pale, unearthly bea.ut_v. Trippingly,
' tl'ippingly,slle walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat
with him behind a windward dune and listened to a couch shell
and sighed sweetly and took out a little gold pencil and a little
morocco notebook and wrote a little poem:
I 1:.»/ill lie upon. the shore,
I will "lie a dreasmer,
I will feel the sea once more,
Pomzdirng on my femm‘.

Tllorwald’s second date was with a physical education major

 

  

. , /
~llcrlzo”//oz’ 61//2/5/5’ irélf 1%’ I:§fﬂ//aWl7£%I77c /d//hf...

named Peaches Glendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile
and a size 18 neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder track 0
Where they did 100 laps to open the pores. Then they played
four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 36 holes of golf, nine
lnIllllg‘S of one o’cat, six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile and a.
quarter of leapfrog. Then they went ten .rounds with eight
ounce gloves and had heaping bowls of whey and exchanged 9.
ﬁrm llandsllakc and went home to their respective whirlpool
baths.

'l‘horwald’s ﬁnal date was with a golden-haired, creamy-
browed, green-eyed, red—lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi
Sigaloos. Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said,
“(lee whillikers, what/s college for anyhow-to ﬁll your head
full of icky old facts, or to. discover the shilling essence tllatjs
YOU 27”

Totsi‘ started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious
restaurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. *I"ron1. there they went, to a deluxe movie palace where
Tot.’-ii had popcorn with butter. Then she had a bag of chocolate

‘ covered raisins—also with butter. Then they went to a costly
ballroom and did the Twist till dawn, tipping the band every
eight bars. Then they went toa Chinese restaurant where
Totsi, unable -to tlmlslat-e the menu, solved her problem by
ordering one of everything. Then Thorwald took her to the
womeu’s dorm, boosted her in the window, and ‘went downtown
to wait 1" or the em_plo_vment office to open. T

VVllile waiting, Thorwald. thought over all of his girls and

' came to a sensible decision. “I think,” he said to llinlself, “tlmt
I will stick with Marlboros. I am not rich enough for girls.”f

Linguistics

2 .. 1‘niiNEWsr- wleaiiesaéty,

February 

Discussed

At Dormitory T alk

By MARILYN EIGES
Dr. Edward Kennard of the an-
thropology department was the

guest speaker at McCormick Hall
Dormitory Monday night.
Before an informal gathering of

interested students Dr. Kennard ’

spoke on “Linguistics———the study
of words.”

The purpose of linguistics is to
study and deﬁne a language in all
its aspects—the pronunciation,
grammar, and meaning of. words.
It also includes the study of
change of a language, or histori-
cal. linguistics.

. Constantly Changing

‘ Dr. Kennard said that a lan-
guage exists in a state of constant
change, not only in time, but in
space. Spatially, Americans speak

s e v e r a 1 languages, commonly ‘i

called dialects. Many pronuncia-
tion differences are so vast that a
northerner for example is unable
to understand the speech of some-
one south of the Mason-Dixon
line. New Englanders have many

speech idiosyncracies as do those

people west of the Alleghenies. It
is the job of aislinguist to deter-
mine these differences and deﬁne
them.

, Historical change is also of
interest to a Linguistic. Great,
changes in a language are read-
ily observable when one com-
pares the works of Chaucer with
those of a modern writer, ac-
cordingly to Kennard.

Change also occurs in the spe-
ciﬁc vocabulary of a ‘people.
Words can be said to fall into
three. general 4 categories -— t h e
learned form, the standard form

 and the sub-standard form. Words

in their usage tend tg move either

which refreshments were served.
