Pitt master plan criticized by local groups

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

Pitt’s plans for construc-
tion over the next five years
do not include enough
improvements in student
housing or in reduction of
traffic congestion in
Oakland, said the chairman
of the Oakland Neighbor-

hood Alliance, Marshall
Goodwin.

“We would rather see
money spent addressing
those issues than on a bas-
ketball arena which will
cause more problems for the
community,” Goodwin said.

The Oakland Neighbor-
hood Alliance wants to see
an increase in on-campus
housing for graduate under-

graduate students because of
the problems that result from
students living in residential
areas, Goodwin said.

Those problems include
noise, parties and the lack of
upkeep of the neighborhood,
Goodwin said. Residents
would like students to know
“that when they put their
trash out and [the city]
doesn’t pick it up that [the

students] should take it back’
in,” he said.

Goodwin criticized.the
draft copy of Pitt’s Master
Space Plan, which describes
Pitt’s construction plans for
the next five years and
breaks them up into short-
range goals, mid-range goals
and long-range goals. The
plan will bepresented to the

Pitt student claims police brutality

By Sam Gresock
and Mark Gordon
The Pitt News

A 24-year-old Pitt student said he was beaten
up by Pittsburgh city police officers outside the

Original Hot Dog Shop in late August.

A Pittsburgh police report said the student was
causing a disturbance in the restaurant’s bar area
and began arguing when he was told to leave.

Looking for an independent voice, Pitt sopho-
more Tim Allen is searching for witnesses who
may have any information about the possible

incident.

Allen said at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Aug.

28, two Pittsburgh city police officers forcibly
removed him from the restaurant after Allen ’
argued with another officer who had asked him

to stop playing a game of cards.

Pitt professor questions the end of apartheid

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

Pitt Professor Dennis Brutus
expressed skepticism that apartheid has
completely ended in South Africa.

Referring to an editorial in Tuesday’s
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, in which the
writer mentioned South Africa as an
exemplary democracy, Brutus
questioned the validity of this example
at yesterday’s History Department-
sponsored Brown Bag Lunch Seminar.

Under the interim constitution, which
lasts until 1999, possession of power in
South Africa is not based on the results
of the election, as they normally are,
said Brutus.

“Unless the [majority] party won 67
percent of the votes counted they
would be required to form what is
called a government of maximum unity

. all of the parties that participated

I in the election, as long as they got 5

percent of the total votes counted,
each of those parties was entitled to

a seat not only in the parliament, but in
the cabinet,” said Brutus.

“So you end up with a cabinet com-
posed of a variety of political view-
points, both those who are committed to
democratic change and those who had
opposed democratic change,” said
Brutus.

Defining apartheid, Brutus said it sep-
arated whites and non-whites. “But not
merely separates them in a process
of segregation, but by law. Whites

New Van
Dcimme
movie
filmed in
Pittsburgh

By Matt Serlin
Managing Editor

Hollywood has been
transplanted to Pittsburgh
while Jean-Claude Van
Damme films his new

. movie, billed as “Die

Hard on the Ice.”

The producers of the
film, “Sudden Death,”
are looking for people to
ﬁll the stands of the
Civic Arena on ﬁve sep-
arate occasions.
Everyone is eligible.

The plot of the film
revolves around Van
Damme, who plays a for-
mer Pittsburgh ﬁreﬁght-
er who works as a securi-
ty guard at the arena.

A terroristic threat
against the arena dur-
ing game seven of the
Stanley Cup finals
between the Pittsburgh
Penguins and the
Chicago Blackhawks
supplies the bulk of the
action in the ﬁlm.

Scenes being shot in
the arena are mostly
crowd shots, and there
will be plenty of oppor-
tunities for people to get
on camera.

Several local hockey
personalities will be on
hand for the filming,
including Mario
Lemieux, who has a
cameo appearance in the
ﬁlm.

The film is being shot
at 20 different locations
throughout Pittsburgh,
according to a spokesper-
son for the ﬁlm.

The filming in the
arena will take place
today, Oct. 3, 4, 7,and 10.
Admission to the event is
free and open to anyone.

People wishing to
attend the event need to
pick tickets up at local
Shop ‘n Save stores or
Koenig Sports.

The filming will con-
tinue through December.
The movie is tentatively
set for release in the
spring of 1995.

Apartheid

going into black areas or ~

blacks going into white areas
were jailed for the crime of
being in the wrong area,”
Brutus said.

Through apartheid, .whites,
who made up 13 percent of
the population, controlled 87
percent of the land, Brutus
said.

Outlining important dates
in the apartheid time line,
Brutus said South Africa
became a state in 1910, a
republic in 1960 and the sys-
tem supposedly caved in dur-
ing 1990.

. “[l960] is also the year
when the opposition of the
black majority to minority
white rule crystalizes and

takes two forms. First,
unarmed resistance  and
armed resistance,” said
Brutus.

Both the African National
Congress and the Pan-
African Congress were
banned and declared

banned organizations, Brutus
said. “The organizations are
driven underground and
announced that they are
now moving from a non-vio-
lent struggle to a group that
will not exclude violence.”
“lt’s worth remembering
the factors involved in
bringing about that change,
of which one of easily the
most important was
student activism in the
United States,” Brutus said.
According to Brutus, when
he first came to Pitt, the
university had $72 million
invested in South African-
related industries. Now it’s
down to about $14 million.
“There were other factors
of course [for the change],
but certainly the economic
pressures externally, com-
bined with pressures inside
. and probably what hurt
South Africa more than any-
thing else was exclusion
from international sports,”
said Brutus.

Safety

°From page I

It all started when Debbie
Gardner was training to be a
police officer in Cincinnati. She
was the top student in her class,
but when she was confronted
with real criminals, she froze
and she could not breathe,
according to her husband. She
told that story to her teacher,
Mike, and he told her that she
was the first person he knew
who admitted fear.

Not being able to breathe in
dangerous situations has
become a focus for the seminar.

“The winner in violence is
the person who is breathing
when it is over,” Debbie
Gardner said.. “The problem is
that we hold our breath in a cri-
sis situation.”

During the seminar, Gardner
picked four people out of the
audience to pose as four types
of criminals. There was a thief,
a frustrated individual, a psy-
chotic person and an assassin.
She stressed that a big part of
the problem with some of these
criminals is drugs and alcohol.

“When someone is high, they

don’t care. They have extraor-
dinary strength, and they don’t
feel anything,” she said.
“People who are buzzed don’t
respond to pain.”

Gardner said a way to com-
bat these individuals is to main-
tain your self—confidence
through your breathing and to
get a grip on the situation.

“Everything you need, you
got. We have got. to give you
the power to get past your
fear,” she said. A

Gardner also spoke about the
importance of realizing that the
responsibility of self-defense is
up to yourself.

“We are fighting for people’s
freedom, but we are demanding
they take 100 percent responsi-
bility for their safety,” Gardner
said. “Law enforcement’s job is
to get there, not be there,” she
added.

Theresa Rifenburg was one
of the many Pitt students in
attendance last night.

“I’m from a small town, and
[the safety seminar] is a good
idea just in case something
happens,” Rifenburg said.

to me to see that the universi-

“It doesn’t mean there

said.

Short-term construction projects
include adding to Hillman Library,
building a convocation center and reno-
vating Pitt Stadium football facilities
and the Music Building.

Pitt does consider providing more
housing a high priority in order to
become more competitive with other
schools, but “we have a very full plate
in terms of what we need money for,”

The Oakland Neighborhood Alliance
will ask Pitt to establish parking
facilities outside of Oakland, make
more of an effort to encourage people to
carpool and provide employees with bus
passesinstead of parking spaces,
Goodwin said.

The Master Plan at least shows that
Pitt has recognized housing and trans-
portation problems, Anderson said.

“Everybody might not like the conclu-

because at least we’ve got dialogue.”

Jones and Goodwin said they would
like students to contribute to this dia-
logue.

“We consider [students] a part of the

“It’s just figuring out how‘ we can all
live together,  how we can learn from

get outl.”' Allen said. ‘‘I was
wondering how this guy was
allowed to be so rude to the
O’s customers.”

After Allen told a manager
on duty at the Original that the
officer was being rude, he said,
another officer grabbed him by
the neck, picked him up and
threw him out of the restau-
rant, causing Allen to hit his
head off the sidewalk.

According to the incident
report, Allen repeatedly argued
with police after talking to the
manager, ignored three orders
to leave the restaurant, and
was escorted outside by offi-
cers who told him not to
return.

As he was taken out of the
restaurant, Allen said the offi-
cers threw him to the ground
and left him there as they went
back into the Original.

“They carried me outside
and slammed the back of my
head off the sidewalk,” Allen
said. “My legs were kicking as
if I were in some sort of
seizure.”

Allen said when he went
back into the restaurant and
tried to get the second officer’s
name, he was thrown out
again, causing his head to
strike the sidewalk again.

“The next thing I know I’m
waking up on the pavement
face down, and one hand is
getting a handcuff put on it,”
Allen said.”I couldn’t control
my legs. I was spinning after
[the officer] smashed my head
 I was in pain.”

According to the incident
report, Allen was arrested for
disorderly conduct and deﬁant
trespass. Allen said he spent
the rest of the night in a cell in
the City of Pittsburgh Public
Safety Building and was
released Aug. 28 around 9
p.m. ’

“I was not told to stay out or
not come back in [the restau-
rant] unless smashing some-
one’s head off the pavement
means that,” Allen said.

Though Allen said he
injured his head, elbow and
neck during the altercation, he
did not seek medical attention
until he returned to Pitt Aug.
29. According to a Pitt Student
Health Service report, Allen
also originally told Student
Health employees he did not
lose consciousness, then later
said he did become uncon-

Senate goes national

Come November, Pennsylvania will once again be at the fore-
front of the national political scene. The cause is the U.S.
Senate race between the current Democratic Senator Harris
Wofford and Republican Representative Rick Santorum.

This race has national importance for a number of reasons. In
the spring of ‘9l, Wofford was appointed interim Senator by
Governor Casey when Republican Senator John Heinz died in
office. This led to a special runoff election pitting Wofford
against then Attorney General Richard Thornburg. Wofford,
running largely on the need for health care reform, overcame a
40-point deficit to defeat Thornburg. This not only brought the
issue of health care to national attention, but was also the first
major sign of dissatisfaction with the Bush administration.

This year’s race is making headlines for many similar rea-
sons. Wofford is often‘strongly identified with President
Clinton, and Republicans would love to exact revenge for the
embarrassing ‘9l defeat and then use it against Clinton. Also,
some see this race as another litmus test on health care. Victory
by Wofford could maintain the desire for reform; conversely, a
Santorum win may send health reform down the drain.
Furthermore, many people believe the Republicans to be
grooming the young Santorum for “bigger and better things.”

What is certain is that the race will be hotly contested, and a
great deal of national attention (and money) will be centered

on Pennsylvania. The Pitt News urges everyone to closely
follow this election and to find out the truth about both candi-
dates.

Pass clean air

The Pennsylvania Senate voted 36-13 on Tuesday to delay
implementation of an auto emissions inspection program until
a better one can be drawn up. The bill now goes to the House
where, if passed, it could place Pennsylvania in violation of
the 1990 Clean Air Act.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. has ordered
Pennsylvania to begin a stringent auto emissions program in
the state’s 25 smoggiest counties. If Pennsylvania fails to com-
ply, the EPA has threatened to impose sanctions which include
the loss of $900 million a year in federal highway funds.

The Pitt News urges the Pennsylvania House to vote against
the measure and allow the inspection program to be enacted.
The Clean Air Act was a big step forward in dealing with pol-
lution. For Pennsylvania to hold up the process is unjustifi-
able. Auto emissions programs have been effective in
California and if they can work there then they can certainly
work in here. Furthermore, torisk the loss of $900 million in
federal highway funds is highly irresponsible on the part of the
Pennsylvania Legislature. Reportedly, the debate in the Senate
had more to do with the governor’s race than pollution. Quit
playing politics, do your jobs and allow pollution control to go
through. ’

CWO disagrees with The Pitt News

Dear Editor,

On behalf of The Campus
Women’s Organization, we
wish to respond to the Sept.
27 article that appeared in
The Pitt News concerning
our meeting that was held on
Sept. 22.

CWO did indeed contact ‘

the Office of Public Safety
before the meeting occurred
and inquired about an assault
that was mentioned in the
The Pitt News police blotter
and said that the issue
was under further investiga-
tion.

We then independently dis-
covered the identity of the
fraternity house in question.
Later that evening, we raised
the issue for discussion and
concluded that more infor-
mation would be needed in
order to pursue the matter.

CWO has contacted the
Office of Public Safety
and the Interfraternity

Council and is fully cooper-O

ating with both organiza-
tion’s efforts.

LE 1' '1' E R s

 

We have been in communi-
cation with these two organi-
zations for several days,
despite the false allegations
that were made by The Pitt
News.

We have been unjustly
accused by The Pitt News on
several occasions, apparently
they continue to report false
information.

If they would have made
direct contact with CWO.
concerning the editorial on
Sept. 28, they would have
known that their information
was false.

CWO expects an apo-
logy due to their con-
stant degradation of our
character.

We are confident that
Public Safety will ensure a
thorough investigation.
CWO has a great interest in
these allegations, and if they
prove to be well-founded,
then we expect proper mea-
sures to be taken. Until that
time, CWO will be tireless in
their efforts in pursuing jus-
tice.

Sincerely,

Stephanie Sudzina
Scott Dolin
Co-Presidents of CWO

Gun control debate article is one-sided

Dear Editor,

a possible
Moore.

anti-gun bias by Mr.

John Moore’s article in The Pitt News
article of Sept. 26, “Debaters discuss
gun control issue” leaves the reader with a
highly biased account of the gun con-
trol issue. With both Kenneth Steinberg,
V.P. of Pennsylvania Against Violence
and Michael Slavonic, NRA board of
director member present at the debate, Mr.
Moore has chosen only to include Mr.
Steinberg’s anti-gun point of view in his arti-
cle.

The omission of Mr. Slavonic’s points
of view regarding gun ownership by
law-abiding citizens and their right to
self-defense is inappropriate and expresses

  

Would you like to wriie
for opinions? We won!
you! Call 648-7984 and

ask for Tom. ‘I

It could be construed, by the omission
of pro-gun views in the article, that Mr.
Moore believes that the anti-gun case is so
weak that it could be easily refuted by Mr.
Slavonic’s comments.

I hope Mr. Moore will leave his one-
sided writing to the editorial page in the
future. '

New York. I’m just glad to be back. (who would’ve '

thought?) One good thing that came out of my trip was
the phat shit on the radio. KRS One and his boys were

catching mad wreck on 98.7 KISS during ,
Supernatural’s (ex- NMS winner; victim of a Craig G E5’

lyrical beatdown) show. Kris ripped it thoroughly. Then,
there’s the ill joint with Da Brat, Jermaine Duprifand
The Notorious B.l.G. It comes off lovely. But, the
phattest thing that I heard was the obese freestyle fea-
turing B.l.G, Craig Mack, Rampage: The Last Boy
Scout and L.L. Cool J. l’m tapping my sources to get
a copy that one! It’s in regular rotation on Hot 97 in New
York. For the illest flavor in Pittsburgh, tune in to 92.1
WPTS FM with yours truly from 9pm - 11pm on
Fridays, Tenth Brother from 11pm - 1am on Fridays,
and The 40 D’s on Tuesdays from ttpm — 1am. More
shows are definitely on the way. A lot of people are get-
ting real open to the video show that I work on. Mad
shots to Dex, Big Chuck and others who have shown
love to it. For those that are missing out, you can catch
it on Mondays at 11pm. You have to have cable
(PCTV channel 21; cable ready TV’s B-side channel 7).
lt’s the world’s first R—rated video show; it’s so freakin’

If you’re true to this, then you must have heard of
him. First he was brought to the world’s attention by
winning the Source Magazine’s Unsigned Hype Artist
of the Month back in late ‘91—ear|y ‘92. Rhyming over
nothing but a breakbeat, BIG caught wreck and much
respect. From then, the buzz was on. He flexed a little
somethin’ on the remix of Mary J. Blige’s “Real
Love’f. Shortly after that, he teamed up with Heavy D.,
3rd Eye, Guru, Busta Rhymes and Rob 0. to freak
the ill posse cut “Al Buncha Niggas.” He then signed a
single deal with Uptown Records and dropped the
underground hit “Party And Bullshit”, from the Who’s

    
 
  
 
 
 
 

The Man? soundtrack. He freaked the “What’s The
11” remix with Mary J. (which, coupled with another
erse without Mary or K-Ci and totally different music,
ecame the infamous “Dreams”, which will not be
eleased publicly and is not on this album.) From there,
he rest was all BadBoy and BIG. ‘

“Juicy” was the first cut that introduced the debut
lbum to the world. It was (and still is) burning up the
harts. With the classic song “Juicy Fruit” by MTume as
he base, BIG freaks a phat rags-to-riches story. The B-
ide “Unbelievable” is pure buttah! The DJ Premier-
roduced track is a smooth, bare-bones track that
llows BlG’s style to run rampid. The album’s title cut is
ust crazy ill. “The What,” the only true duet on the
lbum, has BIG and Method Man rippin’ shit on a
mooth loop. The two styles are so complementary,
hey should be a group. “Suicidal Thoughts” is anoth-
_ r track on some old orbital shit. His angle on this one
‘V is from the perspective of a suicidal person reaching
out to his boy, ending in imminent death. BIG is one of
the illest story tellers to date. At this moment, in my
opinion, I don’t think anyone can touch him for the
moment. The entire album is the shit.

Of course, there are some beefs to be had, but it’s
nothing too major. First, the skit with him getting his
d**k sucked could’ve been left out of this. Second, even
though the version of “Me & My Bitch” is dope, the
original is a lot better than that one because it’s a lot
smoother. The intro is also different from what was on

Wednesday, 3:24 p.m.,'.
Lamar Phillips left Oasis
Records and Tapes strapped
with a new cassette single by
Artifacts, “Wrong Side of the
Tracks.” Phillips is 16 years
old. The tape is Clean. No Dirt.
No vulgarity. And, no parental
warning label.

Tuesday. Same time, same
place. Phillips fronted the cash
for Underground Kings. A
PARENTAL ADVISORY had
been smacked on the tape.

In between the two purchas-
es, PennsyIvania’s House
Judiciary Committee had met,
and took steps to make
Phillips’ Tuesday-purchase
illegal for his age group, that
under-18 crowd.

Wednesday morning the
committee reviewed House Bill
2982, which would make it ille-
gal for people under the age of
18 to purchase CDs, tapes or

albums with parental warning
labels. If made into a law, HB
2982 would impose $25-$100
fines upon any.music outlet
violating the prohibition and
require 25-100 hours of com-
munity service at a rape crisis
center for juveniles purchasing
stickered material.

Overwhelmingly, 21-3, the
committee approved the bill for
a House vote in the near
future.

The biII’s sponsor, T.J.
Rooney, D- Northampton, said
that since being drafted in
June, the bill has made
remarkable progress.
However, the bill may not be
voted on for months because
the state legislature will soon
take an election break, then
adjourn Nov. 30 and recon-
vene in January.

Although, Rooney said,
“Technically, it could be voted

in as early as Tuesday in the
House.”

The bill has drawn staunch
criticism from the American
Civil Liberties Union as well as
other organizations. Limiting
the distribution of an artist’s
music violates the First
Amendment’s freedom of
speech clause and is unconsti-
tutional, said ACLU lobbyist
Larry Frankel.

John Woods, co-founder of
Rock Out Censorship, said his
organization will continue to
mount mass opposition
against the bill.

“There’s going to be a hell of
a fight in January,” he said.

Woods said his organization
frequently deals with such leg-
islation but that this bill is the
most extreme he has ever
been involved with. Levying
fines on music outlets and
requiring minors to undergo

community service would be
the most extreme methods of
dealing with music and its
alleged influence on street vio-
Ience, Woods said.

“Considering the punitive
attachments to it, this is the
most dangerous bill I have
seen,” he said.

Phillips said he believes the
punishment for breaking such
a law would be too strict.

“lt’s kind of harsh because

you are just buying some

tapes, and the music usually
tells the truth anyways,” he
said.

However, Rooney said he is
willing to make adjustments in
some parts of the bill, but
could not specify what those
changes may entail.

In order for the bill to be
made into a law, the state
House must pass it with 110
votes, the Senate must submit

26 votes in favor of the bill and
the Governor must sign it.

“I’ve talked to a number of
senators, both Democrat and
Republican, and I think it
would most probably meet with
the same type of favorable
approval that it met with in
committee today,” Rooney
said.

While worried about the pos-
sible effects of HB 2982 in
Pennsylvania, Woods said he
fears passage of such a bill in
other states as well.

He said, ‘‘It is going to set a
real dangerous precedent.
You're going to see a lot of
other states jump on the band-
wagon.”

Wickedly loud music
cranked out of the doors as
I approached what was to
be my home for the next 24
hours. As I walked into the
urinesque light of The Pit
theatre lobby, I was greeted
by the vivacious faces
responsible for the first
Improvathon at Pitt.

Before I plunge into my
experience, let me say that

Improvathon raised
$1,350.37 for cystic fibrosis.
Improvathon was put

together in three weeks by
the ambitious regulars who
run Friday Night lmprovs. It
started at 11 p.m. last
Friday and ended at 11 p.m.
last Saturday.

I grabbed a seat house
right while a skinny, young
man raised his arms and
proclaimed, “I have

supreme power over your

souls.’’ If I didn't know
emcee Chick Leiby person-
ally, I still would have
laughed.

OK, so Chick was out of
control with his incredible
spasms of energy starting
regular Friday Night
lmprovs. They played a mil-
lion games, like freeze,
which involved two people
starting an improv, someone
yelling “freeze!” one of the
starters coming out of the
game and the new person
beginning a different improv.

The cool thing is that
everything everyone did
was encouraged and sup-
ported by everyone there,
except for a couple _of peo-
ple they had to kill because
they‘just weren’t funny.
Even after the killings,

=-2% _.
everyone helped cle
the mess.

Anyway, back to the truth.
The night was full of rhyth-
mic sounds from
Bobespierre and the Reign
of Terror, Blindsight (who
pleasantly burned incense
while they played), The
Distractions (Improvathon
unplugged), Blogurt and
other bands who donated
their talent.

Not only did bands play,
but all types of artists took
the stage and shared their
work. Adiva Blacque
(lmprovathon’s official drag
queen) performed, amateur
playwrights staged plays,
actors performed, poetry
was recited, there was a
Bid-for-FNI-regulars (a
“Love Connection” kind of
thing) which alone brought

ore than $300. Of
course, they bought them-
selves, but it went to charity,
so who cares. Audience
members purchased the FNI
regulars for,a night of magi-
cal ouija m.ania under the
stars.

Right, I’m back from yet
another bizarre joke that
seems to go on forever. I
guess looking back at my
experience, I tend to slowly
start sinking into the crazy
world of improv. It was an
amazing time.

“lt’s good karma,” smiled
Andy Gavlinski, one of the
24-hour supporters.

I must admit it was good
karma. Sponsors donated
all kinds of food: donuts,
cookies, pizza, salad, soda,
oh and of course bagels.

Pitt Theatre kicks off the
semester with two student-
directed lab productions.

The Ruffian on the Stair
comes from the renowned
archives of Joe Orton (author of
What the Butler Saw). This pro-
duction goes up Sept. 29, 30
and Oct.1 at 8 p.m.

Colin Grube is directing and
designing this dark, psychologi-
cal drama with a cast of three:
Dawnelle Stutzman (Joyce),
Daniel Brown (Mike), and David
Martin (Wilson).

Without spilling all the juicy
details, the play is about Joyce
and Mike being tormented by
Wilson because Mike killed his
brother.

“lt’s violence, passion and
goldfish,” laughed Grube. ‘‘I’m
telling a story about domestic
violence and independence.”

The second kick-ass lab is
Corinne Jacker’s, Bits and
Pieces, which goes up Oct. 6, 7
and 8. Heather Harrison will be
directing this realistic, dark com-
edy commenting on male-female
relationships.

The cast creating lris’s search
to meet the different people now
using her late husbands’ organs
are: Aaron Turner (Phil), Desiree
Ciancio (Iris), Chick Leiby (a
cross-dressing Italian prostitute),
Kate Freed (Helen-Phil’s sister)
and Gorgeana Genchur (Mrs.
Eberly). Leiby and Genchur will
be performing a variety of roles.

“WhoIe things aren’t as impor-
tant to society as the bits and
pieces,” remarked Harrison.

Both productionsstart at 8
p.m. and include a Saturday

Picture Perfect Morning
Edie Brickell
Geffen

Once upon a time there was
group called the New
Bohemians. They played dood-
ly, Grateful Dead-inspired jazz
pop and an earthy singer
named Edie Brickell.

Geffen Records signed them,
and before you could say “sell-
out,” they became Edie Brickell
and the New Bohemians. With
the spotlight on Ms. Brickell, the
label probably figured more
people would take notice and
buy their records.

After scoring a minor hit with
their existential reworking of
Popeye’s “l Yam What I Yam”
credo, the band virtually disap-
peared from sight. Articles
described how Geffen manipu-
lated this naive band, even forc-
ing them to boot their original
drummer. They became the
textbook example of what not to
do when courted by a major
label.

Now Edie has jettisoned the
New Bohemians and bought
herself an acoustic guitar. She
doesn’t need all that deadweight
anyhow, right? Well, |et’s see.

On Picture Perfect Morning,
her music has shifted away from
the Dead/HORDE kids to the
mature easy-listening crowd.
With her husband Paul Simon
producing (providing a strange
twist on the Mrs. Robinson sce-
nario), Brickell’s album is perfect
for “|ite” music fans. It sounds
great as background music,
never requiring any effort from
the listener and never providing
anything too rough. lt’s ....... ..
nice.

Everyone else will find Picture
Perfect Morning to be a bland,

lifeless, unimaginative piece of
fluff.

Maybe it isn’t fair to assume
that Edie just learned to play
guitar because she does on
several tracks. But her strum-
ming, and more importantly her
writing, come off like a begin-
ning musician. “Tomorrow
Comes” opens the album on a
bad note, no pun intended. The
song is built around two chords
with no changes or dynamic
shifts to give it any variety. It just
drags on for nearly four min-
utes.

On “Good Times,” she takes
a stab at soul music and winds
up embarassing everyone
involved. The song lacks imagi-
nation, the arrangement is stiff
and the spoken interlude by
Barry White turns the whole
thing into a parody. White
hasn’t sounded this amusing
since his cameo on “The
Simpsons.”

Brickell has decent song
ideas, but she seems to lack
the imagination to flesh them
out. Her lyrics normally sound
,so trite, they border on cliche
’(“lt’s hard to believe that you’re
really here/ So I just pretend
that you’re not there”). Even the
titles have been used before:
“When the Lights Go Down”;
and in addition to “Good
Times,” you’ll find the unrelated
“Hard Times.”

If you’re looking for some
wallpaper music, Picture
Perfect Morning will provide
plenty of it. if not, ignore it and it
will hopefuly go away

Dogs Under Stress
Moe Tucker
1994 Sky Records

Moe Tucker ain’t no dead
blues singer like most people
think, and that wonderful teeny-
bopper magazine, Sassy, loves
her new album. I, naturally, love
Moe too. For the less enlight-
ened students, Moe Tucker
was the drummer for the Velvet
Underground. Over the past
few years, she has worked at
Wal-mart, released five solo
efforts and appeared on works
by the likes of Half Japanese
and others. These days,
though, she picks up a guitar
instead of drum sticks on her
albums.

In her latest release, she
interweaves anti-establishment
lyrics along with the standard
pop-music style. If you’re not
careful, you can find yourself
singing along to lyrics like '‘I
don’t care what you need or
what you choose to read/
‘cause it's me myself and I;
that’s who I look out for.” Moe
expresses ideas of discontent
honestly through simple lyrics
that .aren’t overpowered by the
music.

It's refreshing that she plays
the electric guitar and sings
loudly, while presently most
females are whining away in
their ethereal genre. For the
interest of any indie-rock music
buff, Sterling Morrison from VU

definite VU influence evident in
the majority of songs. The influ-
ence lies in the fact that VU
employed the minimalistic tech-
nique of standard drumming
and straight-forward guitars.
Moe continues this tradition of
playing and adds her own spe-
cial touch, which marks her as
an original instead of someone
living off the fame of former
bands. I think Moe Tucker is
simply really fresh and that
everyone should go and buy
her record. While you’re out
spending your hard earned
money, pick up her other bril-
liant 1994 release, I Spent a
Week There the Other Night.
Moe allows a glimpse of monot-
onous middle-class America to
show through her catchy “sing-
along” lyrics and music. Moe is
definitely the best damn song-
writer the walls of Wal-mart
have ever seen.

Luscious Jackson
Grand RoyaVCapitol

T777'7V‘7TVTTTTTTT"7VT7TTTTT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXXXXXXXXIIXXXXXIXXXX

Freak that wax. Whether
Motown or Manhattan’s Lower
East Side, if ever a ’90s band
validates pop’s return to the
groovier-than-thou sensibilities
of '70s hipness, then Luscious
Jackson is it —— the smartest
“once—upon-a-retro-time” story
since Arnold Horschak began
cuttin’ up Mr. Kotter’s class.
With the same cunning found in
mangy alley cats who have sur-
vived several Village winters,
these street-savvy, grunge-
weary womyn have created a
serious, studious sound using
harmonious r&b snippets sug-
gesting Beastiepop — jazz,
horns, hip hop and a yo-yo-yo

be-bop. Although Natural

Ingredients could have easily
been a tired platform shoe
cliché, the album is much more

a moody, funk-infused compila-
tion than a means to cash in on
a transient trend — demonstrat-
ing a genuine artistry on this
record, the band’s first full-
length release.

Although the album’s organic
sound is more refined than In
Search of Mannys under-pro-
duced EP appeal, check out “LP
Retreat’ for a well-defined old-
school ethos: “This is the culture
of dusty old vinyl/this is the tribal
record of love [sic] put the nee-
dle on the record Mr. DJ/you
can’t kill the culture.” Aluminum
foil brush strokes on’. snare,
sedated synth and a down-beat
bass conjure up verité images
of a sluggish Valium-popping
populace diggin’ each other on
graffiti-soaked subways. The
song’s crackling pop and low-
key crescendos help Jill Cuniff

‘make the dreamy assertion: “l’m

escapin’ to vinyl shores.” She
doesn’t go alone, however,
because it’s LJ’s intention to
bring listeners along with them to
that magical isle of style.

A surreal, colorful strain also
runs throughout the album and
is most prominent on “Energy
Sucker’ with Gabrielle Glaser’s

 

warped wah—wah guitar.
Assertive, “l-am-woman” lyrics
also give the song an ERA-liber-
ation tone: “hey energy
sucker/l’m a goddess not your
mother” — all the while hanging
onto Kate Schellenbach’s hip
hop, high-hat trap. Soul-driven
rhythms and lyrics also have a

place in “Strongman,” which,

mature vocals complement the

sionfest figuring on almost every
track. “Find Your Mind,” “Pele

Yet there’s been no discussion

home), and signing to a major
label (which they’re already
on.) God forbid the band tries
to get paid for making music!

I know 18 months is kind of
generous, but I don’t want to
come off as a cynic.

I have yet to see a video
from this group, don’t know if
a single has been released and
know nothing about the band
(other than what’s printed on
the album sleeve). So the
songs must stand alone. And
they do a pretty good job of
not falling down. only teeter-
ing once or twice.

coiiltl use a. fix or l.\\7t)- oi‘ lithi-

best lyrics i‘t‘;\’0l‘t’i.3 around
2ilili~.'-:0-Cléii. tjlest:‘u:.::,i-,'e situa-
tions. “Capsi;«iecl.."’ the second

song on the album. begins
with the oh so profound. “I
hate you, yet I imitate you.
You‘re in my dreams pushing
me around.” Not straying too
far from the old hate genre.
“Capsized” is followed by a
song about a stepson wanting
to torch the family home once
daddy is 6 feet under.
(“Stepson”) and then the trials
and tribulations of just anoth-
er crappy day, aptly titled
“Bad Day.” (Lately I can’t
stand people, they’re always
rubbing me the wrong way, I
don’t feel like smiling, it
wouldn’t look right on my
face.”)

The songs are, of course,
laden with power chords and
distortion, (Whatcha expect,
it’s the ‘90s. Even Harry
Connick Jr. plugs in on his
latest album.) but Beebout’s
voice can still be heard,
though at times painfully
straining, over the guitars and
drum.

1 have to mention “Time By
the Dime” before I close.
Coming last on the album, I
missed it the first few times I
listened to Clumsy. The sound
is just as hard as the others,
the lyrics repetitive almost to
a fault, but it sticks in your
head. (This is a good thing.)
“The radio plays the same old
songs, over and over. It’s my
time I can be at home,” (an
ironic lyric seeing as how
people will inevitably be say-
ing it about this band, if they
get big).

The sound is punk but with
a big emphasis on pop which
will cross over well to the
music video channels and the
more progressive radio sta-
tions. This, if we learn any-
thing from history, will play a
big part in their success and
then eventually be the cause
of their downfall.

My advice is to buy the
album. It’s good, and they
deserve the recognition. But
get it before they’re played on
the radio and all the goofy
guys with Caesar cuts start to
bad—mouth the band for sell-
ing—out. (then you can say,
“Yeah I liked them before
they ...”)

Michigan '5
loss was a
hard pill to
swallow

s the
age-
old

_ saying goes,
= a picture

f really does
 speak a thou-
ii sand words.
Columnist In
-Tom every news
Schneider publication,

from the Post-

Gazette to USA Today, there it
was — a portrait of a dejected
Chuck Winters of Michigan
kneeling on the field, with his
head to the ground. In the
background, an ecstatic
Herchell Troutman of
Colorado trots across the field
after he and his fellow
Buffaloes had just completed
an improbable last-second,
come-from-behind 27-26 vic-
tory over the Wolverines in
Ann Arbor.

The painfully descriptive .
Jekyll & Hyde picture typified
the wide range of reaction
after Buffalo quarterback
Kordell Stewart’s 75-yard des-
peration toss into a crowded
end zone came to rest in the
hands of Michael Westbrook
with no time remaining.

Therein lies two real truths
to sports in general. First of
all, the exultation over a victo-
ry cannot exist without the
numbing coldness of defeat.
Second, and most importantly,
one cannot truly appreciate the
former without first having
experienced the latter. —

That second truth holds true
not just for athletes, but for the
fan as well.

What makes Michigan’s loss
to Colorado last Saturday such
a special example of the cruel
nature of sports is the extraor-
dinary circumstances sur-
rounding it.

First of all, the game itself,
regardless of how it ended,
would have a huge impact on
the national championship pic-
ture. Both were top- 10 pro-
grams, with excellent chances

I at the national title.

If the Wolverines had simply
lost the game, they and their
fans would have been disap-
pointed enough. But the way
they lost the game was the cru-
elest way that any loss can

« happen — having a sure victo-

ry snatched away at the
absolute last second.

For the contingent of fair-
weather Wolverine fans, there
were probably a million ques-
tions racing around in their
heads, demanding to be
answered. ~

PH! offensive line under fire

Pitt must
step up
against
Louisville
Saturday  

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

Pitt football coach Johnny
Majors’ crackling remarks and
stem words could be heard
echoing throughout the press
conference Monday. Majors
was angry, and at practice that
afternoon, the yelling must
have been much louder. H

“I’m very upset that we are
not doing better than we are at
this present time,” he said.
“Right now I believe that we
are a sub-par football team.”

These comments came on the
heels of a lackluster loss to
Boston College in which the
Panther offense was lethargic
at best.

The Louisville team which
Pitt faces this Saturday could
be the answer to the Panthers.’

including 153 on the ground.
But the Panthers will likely

Men's, women's tennis
teams whip St. Francis

By Tawnya Adams
For The Pitt News

The men’s tennis team
swept St. Francis College in
singles and doubles, 7-0,
Tuesday night at the Cost
"Center.

“It was a solid performance
for the men’s top six,” Braden
Doherty, the top-seeded sin-
gles player said.

Head coach George
Dieffenbach said the teams
they play determine the out-
come of the games.

“St. Francis wasn’t a strong
men’s team,” Dieffenbach
said.

Pitt beat them by the same
score last year.

Pitt is inexperienced at the
4, 5 and 6 spots, but not hav-
ing strong competition gives
them the opportunity to
improve with every match.

“With everyone winning, it
was a very encouraging day,
and we definitely showed
improvement match by
match,” Doherty said.

This big win has the team
excited for the rest of the sea-
son. “Even though we need to
work on our depth, the team
really showed a solid perfor-
mance today,“ Dieffenbach
said.

By Vicki Geubtnerq
Staff Writer

Switching the doubles line-
up proved successful for the
Pitt women’s tennis team as it
defeated St. Francis 6-3 yes-
terday at the’ Cost Center,
improving its record to 3-4.

The first-time doubles team
of Marla Zielinski and Fran
Davis won 6-2, 6-1.

“They played very well
together,” coach George
Dieffenbach said. “They’re
both attackers and like to get
to the net and put away the
ball.”

Number-one singles player
Alison Baker, who won. her
match 6-1, 6-0, said this past
week the team has been
focusing on “classic dou-
bles,” which means “coming
into the net as fast as we can
and cutting off the first shot.”

This method wasn’t carried
out as well in Baker’s and
Tamara Kalesnik’s doubles
match. . .

“We’ve never really prac-
ticed together. I was paired up
with her because Tammy was
injured,” Baker said.

Captain Tammy Keister
suffered from an injured
wrist. She lost her singles
match 6-4, 6-2.

Big East in rushing at 121

yards a game, will get the start.
“Hopefully Curtis’ ankle will

continue to get better,” center

I Lawson Mollica said. “We’d

like tohave him this week, but
I don’t think it’s going to hap-
pen. But I’m sure that Billy
will do a fine job like he has all
year”

Pitt will continue to try to
establish the run but will also
most likely attempt to take
advantage of a young Cardinal
secondary which starts three
‘sophomores. But after last
weeks debacle against BC,
Majors feels that some changes
may be in order for the passing
game to be effective.

“I’m upset with a couple of
our offensive linemen who just
didn’t get anything done,” he
said. “We’ve got a young quar-
terback who’s probably a little
shell-shocked. He’s competi-
tive, and I have no concern that
he will not bounce back, but
we’ve got to give him a little
more time.

“We’re gonna make a few
changes, but we’re not going to
change anything drastically on
offense or defense.”

“This is going to be an excit-
ing week,” wide receiver Billy
Davis said. A

“There are gonna be a lot of
people whose jobs are on the
line. A lot of people who are
going to have to prove to coach
Majors and to themselves that
that they are capable of playing
the way that they are expected
to play. People are going to
have to put up, shut up or get
out.”

There is also concern on the
other side of the ball. The
defense is currently ranked
next-to-last in the conference

Asher has Pitt's number

By Keith Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

If there’s anyone in the ,

world who knows about beat-
ing Pitt, it must be
Louisville’s Jamie Asher.

Asher, a senior tight end, is
3-0 when facing the Panthers.
Last season, he used the Pitt
contest as a coming out
party, catching six passes for
86 yards in a 29-7 slaughter
at Pitt Stadium.

While others might feel
overconfident when facing a
team they never lost to,
Asher prepares for the worst.

“I think it is going to be a
very good game,” he said.
“Both teams are very well
coached. [The Panthers] are a
rebuilding school just like we
are. They like to get out and
get after it and their tech-
niques are well-taught. They
are a very disciplined team. I
think this is going to be a
hard-hitting game. A couple
of plays here and there for
the winning team is going to
pull it out.

“I definitely think that
Pittsburgh’s record doesn't
show what type of team they

are. They played very diffi- '

cult teams and played well
against those teams.”

While giving credit to the
Panthers, Asher might be the

best offensive player Pitt has
faced all year. Considering
his stats after three games,
the All-American candidate
is making Boston College’s
preseason All-American tight
end Pete Mitchell look like a
Girl Scout.

The 6-foot-4 inch, 245-
pound terror has caught more
passes than any other tight
end in the nation. ,

His 23 pass receptions rank,

him fourth in the nation,
averaging 7.67 catches a
game. Playing in the same
amount of games, Mitchell
has grabbed 16 receptions for
5.3 a game.

Asher also ranks 14th in
the nation while averaging 86
yards per game, Mitchell
only manages 45.

“I know [Asher] is one of
the best receiving tight ends,”
Pitt defensive end Zatiti
Moody said.

“He made some nice catch-
es [this year], but I haven’t
seen him block someone off
the ball. I don’t think he can
block too good.”

This might be one area the
Panthers might get a surprise
on Saturday.

Besides averaging 12.7
yards a reception a year ago,
No. 37 was the co-recipient
of Louisville’s top offensive

The Pitt News, Thursday, September 29, 1994

Like Pitt, Louisville in middle of rebuilding process

‘ Louisville,

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

In his 10th season as head
coach at the University of
Howard
Schnellenberger seems to be one
of only a few bright spots on an
otherwise thin and inexperienced
team.

The Cardinals (1-2) are in a

‘ rebuilding stage with their foot-

ball pro-

gram. After

last year’s

impressive

v 9-3 record

that included

an 18-7 vic-

tory over Michigan State in the

Liberty Bowl, the Cardinals lost

15 total starters from both sides
of scrimmage.

Schnellenberger took the

Cardinals to the Fiesta Bowl in

1990, beat Alabama 34-7, and

- also set a school record with a

10-1-1 season.
The only record in sight for

Schnellenberger this year is his
50th win as head coach at
Louisville. In their only win
against Arizona State, the
Cardinals committed a record 17
penalties and five turnovers. But
for Schnellenberger, a win is a
win.

“We were lucky winning that
game,” Schnellenberger said.
“But from a coachinga stand-
point, we are a lot further along
than I thought we would have
been.”

“This is a season where we
weren’t sure how mature or how
well this football team would
play,” Schnellenberger said.

Though Schnellenberger does
not allude to any change in his
offensive style regardless of the
quarterback, it was the inconsis-
tencies of junior quarterback
Marty Lowe that forced him to
the bench in favor of sophomore
Jason Payne against the Sun
Devils.

“I’ve been pleased with Marty
even though I took him out

against Arizona State,”
Schnellenberger said. “He
knows how to run our offense,
and we can win with the way he
runs it.”

The effectiveness of Lowe
remains to be seen, but it is the
gutsy play and consistency of
senior standout tight end Jamie
Asher that gives the Cardinals
some sort of offensive threat.

Even though statistics show
that Asher has compiled a record
of 256 yards on 23 receptions in
three games, he only has one
touchdown.

Another example of
Louisvil1e’s inconsistency is
senior halfback Anthony
Shelman. Against Kentucky in
the first game of the season he
rushed for 123 yards on 25 car-
ries. Then facing the Longhorns,
he got the _ball 11 times for a
measly 27 yards. In the
Cardinals’ win against ASU,
Shelman ran for 112 yards on 26
carries.

Although Shelrnan is a senior,

he has matched his total carries
from 1992 in the first three
games of this year.

The experience lies in the
offensive line and tight end posi-
tions, Schnellenberger said.

“Two of our four receivers are
freshmen, and one is a junior
college transfer who hasn’t
played much,” Schnellenberger
said.

The “old man” of the receivers
squad is ﬁfth—year senior Shawn
Jackson who is third in recep-
tions this year behind Asher and
freshman split end Miquel
Montano.

“We’re very young at receiver
and quarterback,”
Schnellenberger said. “We are
very experienced at tight end.”

Experience is a reoccurring
theme for the head coach of the
Cardinals, especially since it is
lacking in this football team.

A “[On defense] we’re talking
about nine players who never
lined up for Louisville before,”
Schnellenberger said.

That leaves strong safety Terry
Quinn and defensive end
Kendall Browngthe only two
defensive players who have seen
action prior to this season.

“Right now we are trying to
find our personality,”
Schnellenberger said. “We are
trying to find our determination
and intensity level.”

The Louisville defense is raw
and very thin. The three starting
linebackers are all in their first
year of seeing action, as are three
of the four defensive linemen.

“We’ve been playing four ‘

defensive backs for the whole
game, and the linebackers we
play the whole game too,’-’
Schnellenberger said. “We’ve
played with three defensive tack-
les and three defensive ends, so
we’re virtually playing with all
freshmen.”

Although Louisville does not
appear to be a great threat statis-
tically, Majors is wary of Lowe
and respects the ability, of
Schnellenberger as a coach.

“[Lowe] is a good quarter-
back, we are going to have to
play well,” Majors said.
“Howard was a great [collegiate]

football player and he’s an excel-
lent coach.”
With the numbers

Schnellenberger has produced at
Louisville, along with the
impressive credentials of an 11-
year stint in the NFL, he will
need more than his own ability
and track record to make this a
winning season.

But don’t be too surprised if
the Cardinals make some magic.
It was Schnellenberger who
turned the Miami Hurricane
football program into a power-
house after winning the 1983

_ national championship.

The careers of
Schnellenberger and Majors are
similar. Once again history
repeats itself, and these two men
who faced each other playing
college football years ago, ﬁnd
themselves in basically the same
position this weekend.

They both need a win.

McCullou h

status to e
determined
today

The status of starting point
guard Jerry McCu1lough’s knee
injury will be determined today
at a 1:30 press conference held
by Pitt head basketball coach
Ralph Willard. ‘

Pitt’s orthopedic surgeon Dr.
Freddie Fu will determine
whether McCullough needs
surgery or not prior to the press
conference.

McCullough injured his knee
at an informal pickup game at
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse. He sus-
tained “some damage” to his
anterior cruciate ligament’ and

U knee cartilage.

lineman award.

Cardinal head coach
Howard Schnellenberger
feels he is the best tight end
prospect he’s had at
Louisville because he,
“Blocks as well as he catch-
es.”

Don’t tell Asher this,
blocking is something he
tries to downplay.

“If I had a choice to run a
pass route and catch the ball
or block, I’ll definitely want
to catch the ball,” the four-
year starter said.

“I think [I got the award]
because it might be a mix-
ture between some good
blocking and possibly the
fact I had so many receptions
and coach Schnellenberger
maybe felt like I deserved
the reward. We didn’t have
one to fit my category, and
he just slid me into that cate-
gory.”

One category that Asher
never wants to fall under is a
loser. Coming into this
weekend’s contest against

Pitt, the Cardinals are 1-2.

The team’s slow start
doesn’t bother him because
in his eyes, things are going
to get better.

“I feel we are doing fairly
well,” Asher said. “We got
beat against some teams we
should’ve beaten. But you
know we are kind of young
and you know that’s kind of
been a factor in those games.
But I think as far as giving
out effort and as far as our
work habits, I think we are
doing great.

“We could be down right

now, but there is that bright
side of knowing we could be
3-0 as easy as we are 1-2.”
‘ Asher wasn’t always the
optimist. During his fresh-
man year things were very
rough. The Cardinalssuf—
fered through a 2-9 season.

But as Asher matured as a
ball player, the team devel-
oped into a winner.

His sophomore season, the
Cardinals improved their
record to 5-6. During that

Panthers. who surrendered 21
first-half points to Boston

feed off of their second-half
performance when they shut
out the Eagles and limited
them to 100 yards in total

The Panther secondary, led
by sophomore Denorse
Mosley, the Big East intercep-
tion leader with four, will try to

erratic play. Junior Anthony
Dorsett will make his second
straight start at right corner-

“Dorsett played well in many
ways,” Majors said. “He’s still

He doesn’t have a lot of experi-
