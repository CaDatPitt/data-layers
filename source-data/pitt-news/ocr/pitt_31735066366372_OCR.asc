’_wPasised Unanimously  
MDC Accepts Social Revisions,
Asks Miss Rush to Consider Bill

The Men’s Dorm Council (MDC)
unanimously passed a bill to pre-
sent for consideration its pro-
posed revision of social rules to
Miss Helen Pool Rush.

Harvey Altman, chairman of
the grievance committee, review-

1<__§.ed the progress he had made in

 

his discussions with Saga Food
and Auxiliary Enterprises. Saga
agreed to keep the’ condiment
trays full throughout the meal,
rather than just filling them at
the beginning. They also prom-
ised to service the vending ma-
chines in Tower B more fre-
quently, and experiment with
baked potatoes rather than mash-
ed at the Saturday night meal.
.fl‘he proposed social rules con-

’ tain several major changes from

the rules now in effect. First is
the elmination of restrictions on

the number of parties a house.

might have .in_ any given trimes-

‘ 1., .

ter. The houses would be able
to have an unlimited number
under MDC’s plan.

Secondly, the men’s doors will
no longer be required to be fully
open when there are girls in
their rooms. The new ruling per-
mits the doors to be half-closed,
providing a measure of privacy
for the men and their dates.

Finally, and most controversial
in the Council’s opinion, is a
visitation policy permitting men
to bring their dates up to their
rooms on Friday and Saturday

nights between the hours of 9 ‘

p.m. and I a.m. Joe Seton, chair-
man‘ of the Social Rules Revision
Committee, explained the need
for visitation rights by observing
that after the movie or play, or
dance is over, and after a cou-
ple has had something to eat,
they have nowhere to go if they

Tower C Residents Speak;   is

Refuse Place on MDC

Tower C residents have not expressed any overt inter-.
est in gaining representation on Men’s Dormitory Council
since the Oct. 27 meeting, according to David Ginevan, the
head resident of the Tower. “Since that meeting no one has
contacted the floor counselor or me about becoming a part

of MDC,” Ginevan said. _

Ginevan explained that the
graduate men in Tower C have
never expressed interest as a
group in becoming a part of
MDC. “According to the MDC
Constitution the men would have
to organize into houses to join
MDC and from what the counse-
lors report to me they do not
want to organize like this.” ‘

Harvey Frand, a Tower C grad-
uate student who was not per-
mitted to speak at the Oct. 27
meeting, expressed the same feel-
ing as Ginevan when questioned-
‘Clarifying the situation existing
at that meeting, he explained

  

that when he could not speak,
he asked the name of his repre-
sentative at the “meeting. He was
told that Tower C was not rep-
resented. When MDC was form-
ed, Tower C had the option to
join, but did not take the oppor-
tunity.

“Men’s Dormity Council is an

‘undergraduate organization hav-

ing jurisdiction only over under-
graduate men’s housing and there
is no reason for Tower C to be
represented on it,” Frand said.
He added that the other graduate
residents of Tower C to whom
he had spoken” felt the same

Professor Emeritus Hunt Now Writes

After Retirement as English Teacher

By BERN] McLEOD_

The ability to write, to re-
create a time, place or character
is a gift. According to Dr. Per-
ceval Hunt, professor emeritus of
English, this gift provides the
writer with “the power to say,
exactly right, something worth
saying.” In the years since his
retirement, his knowledge, ex-
perience, and giftedness have en-
abled him 1.9 continue teaching
through three acclaimed and lit-
erary books.

In 1922, Professor Hunt came
to the University from the Uni-
versity of Iowa and for 26 years
taught creative writing, poetry
and Shakespeare. Now retired
and living near the University,
Hunt has written three books
since his retirement in 1948. Be-
cause he considered teaching a
full-time job, he did not write
before. As Frederick Hetzel, edi-
tor of the University Press has
noted, “Admirers of his books
often call the University Press

and reminisce about Professor _

‘Hunt as a teacher and especially
about his class in creative writ-
ing. It was supposed to be some
experience.”

Many critics consider his books
an experience in themselves. In
his ﬁrst, Samuel Pepys in the
Diary, Dr. Hunt has recreated
Pepys with the insight of a close

By WILLIAM R. JEROME

King Lear, while normally a
culminating point for scholars
and devotees of Shakespeare,
seems equally suited as ‘a start-
ing point for newcomers to
Shakespearean drama. All char-
acteristics wit, irony, and rhythm
of Shakespeare are found in
Lear, as well as the larger themes
seldom missing from his other
works. And the American Con-
servatory Theatre production of
King Lear at the Pittsburgh Play-
house, while unavoidably lag-
ging in spots, is a near-complete
and memorable evening of dra-
ma, in the Sheakespeare tradi-
tion. .

The story of the 80-year-old
Lear dividing his kingdom among
his daughters, Goneril, Regan,

It ' and Cordelia, remains appealing

today, for we are still plagued
with the problem of dealing with
aging relatives. But the play, of

. course, is much more. In divid-

ing his realm, Lear asks which
daughter loves him most.

Goneril and Regan use their
family bond to sway Lear, while
Cordelia tells him honestly that
she loves him to the extent of
that bond,"no more nor less. She
is then disinherited by the en-
raged monarch, who secretly
loves her more than his other
two daughters. Cordelia later be-
comes a saving ﬁgure in the play,
and Lear returns to her after
realizing the barbarism of Gon-
eril and Regan and, eventually,
himself. '

A. As with most Shakespeare, fa-
miliarity with the play breeds
contentment. But it is not a must,
for this production begins and
ends with good acting. The audi-
ences in his time had no paper-

back editions to study before-
hand, and so the acting had to
be more than competent to be
successful. Rene Auberjonois as
the aging Lear lives up to this
tradition, bringing ﬂesh and blood
vitality to the paper-and-ink role
in the text as he spits forth the
speeches of the enraged monarch
or literally sings the melancholic
lines of the dying king.

The ironic theme of bondage in
the play—in which Lear is link-
ed by nature to the unnatural
evil of his daughters, Goneril
and Regan—is obviously but not
tritely portrayed by Auberjonois.
He is complemented by the voice
of the Fool, played by Robert
Gammell, who brings wit and hu-
mor to the play, as well as pro-

viding periods of relief between,

scenes of heavy drama. These
two actors in particular have.mas-
tered the rhythm of the play,
and it is noteworthy to observe
the length of the silent periods
of the play as contributing in its
effectiveness.

Also pertinent is thestaging of
this production. The bondage.
theme is graphically represented
by the physical’ distances be-
tween characters which set up
visual tensions corresponding to
the spoken tension. In this‘ way
there is an entire set of visual
contexts, greatly enhanced by

lighting techniques and by the
scenery which, although simple, I

also connotes fluctuating electric

tension as seen in a cardiognaph. '

The background music, too, adds
to the rhythm and vitality of the
play through dissonance and
subtlety.

But somehow, somewhere the
vitality seems to ebb. Perhaps it
is in the text itself which, al-
though streamlined somewhat,
still tends to lag in spots. Even
spirited acting by Auberjonois

and Gammell, by Laurence Luck-

inbil as Edmund, and John Car- I

penteras Gloucester cannot elim-

inate the occasional yawning. ..
This is the weak point of the
production, but it cannot be help— * ,

ed; it even serves to enliven the
already lively scenes, particular-

ly in Act III when Lear turns ::,

mad_upon the heath during a

violent thunderstorm, The rela- _

tive complacency of earlier scenes
leaves with the ﬁrst rush of

blood to one’s head, as Lear f
seethes with raw, bare animal- 

ism on the stage. It is a master-
ful scene; the most memorable
one in the entire production.

Lear then, is a play to be seen.
Visually it oifers much that can-
not be conveyed through text
alone, and the Conservatory pro-
duction exhausts these possibil-
ities. Since sight images thrive
in Shakespeare, the importance
of seeing the plays as Well as
reading them is great. And, all
things considered, this Lear pro.

‘ duction is faithful to the Shakes-

pearean balance of speech and
action. It is a professional effort,
worthy of the attention. of both

A Maid

 Not Honor
All War Dead?

”-Editor, The Pitt News:

 “I? wish to make a few com.
:ments concerning Mr. Supansic’s
{article (Pitt News, Nov. 1).

His reference to Stalingrad was
'-apparently designed to parallel

Nazi Germany's reason for being
in Russia. Our history honors
major should perhaps do a little
more investigation on World War
‘II. The Nazi's position at that
time was not the same as ours,
but ‘was, in fact, the very same
position advocated by Commun-
__ism today. i.e. Communist China's
ecent stand on militant world
-domination by Communism.

Primarily, however, I chal.
lenge Mr. Supansic’s statement
-concerning those German soldiers
who -died in___vain at Stalingrad.

"our position in Vietnam with"

should not honor its beloved war
dead? And what dead should not
be so honored after having made
the supreme [sacrifice for their
people? The fact that they fought
a losing battle for a cause which
is despised by us makes their

deaths no less ho/norable. “Great-_

er love has no man than to lay
down his life for his fellow man.”
As sacrilegious as it may sound,
I must say that I_ honor those
starved, frozen bodies a thousand
times more than those pseudo-
moralists who hide behind the
cloak of paciﬁsm.

It completely escapes me why
any person should be afraid to
display emotion. Is not pride in
and love of one’s country emo-
tionally oriented? Should our
dead soldiers not be openly hon-
ored because persons like Mr.
Supansic prefer to ’stiﬂe feelings
of patriotism? '

Rally Concerned
With Beatriiks

Editor, The Pitt News:

The rally held last Wednesday
to support the troops in Vietnam
was more than disgusting; it was
sickening. It isembarrassing to
be a part of a student body which
equates patriotism with jingoism.
Had the speakers given rational
reasons for our staying in Viet-
nam, the rally might have con-
tained some dignity.

The people who wish the Unit-
ed States to pull out of Vietnam
are not against the ﬁghting troops,
as the leaders of the rally wish
everyone to believe. The infer-
ence that they are is a subtle
twisting of ideas, intended to en-
snare the unthinking. I think we
realize that soldiers are in Viet-
nam because of governmental
policy, not because they wish to
be.

However, more shocking than
the fact that the crowd was irra-
tional in their vociferous support,
of the rally, was the fact that the
demonstration was not really in
support of US. policy in Vietnam.

dents in our University.”

A specific encounter with this
measure" came when one of us
was asked to sign a petition. The
response to’the question of the
purpose of the rally was that it
was “to put down the ‘beatniks’
of the University." If this has
been a minority opinion of the

    

(This is part one of (L, two-part series cmicerning the “South
African azmrtheicl system (sejmrution of peoples on the basis of
- ('olo’r). The information was acquired through conversations be-
tween Barney Desai, ‘president of the South African Colored
People's Congress and Miss Reifman. Quotes and statistics are
taken from speeches Desai has presented. at various sessions of
London’s Parlimnent where he has (ippearecl on behalf of the
oppressed African majority. I)esai and Miss Reifman partici-
palerl in the U_nive-rsity of Oslo International-Summer School
held in Oslo, Noruvly this smmner.)
‘ During a session of the House of Assembly of the Gov-
ernment of South Africa, Jan. 25, the opposition asked that
Africans be consulted regarding the affairs of South Africa.
Prime Minister Dr. Verwoerd quickly replied, “Reduced to
its simplest form the problem isnothing than this: We
want. to keep _South Africa White.” “Keep-
ing it White” can only mean‘ one thing,
namely White domination. Not leadership
nor guidance‘, but -control and supremacy.
The South African minority government
under Verwoerd is determined to mold so-
ciety in accordance to its master-dog ideol-
ogy. All actions and policies concerning the
treatment and status of the Black Africa
perpetuate this ideology. The “repressive
- pass system” is perhaps the most inhuman
MISS REIFMAN of all measures employed by the govern-
ment to suppress the Black majority. This measure restricts
the Africans right of movement, of residence and of em-
ployment by forcing him to carry a pass. More than _one—
half million African’s are arrested each year for unjustified
offenses such as misplacing passes. These offenses are pun-
ished by indefinite terms of detention and whipping. From
Feb. 1, 1963, -the Pass Law was extended to incorporate
women as well as men. _ . '
THE RESULT of this extention is -despicably cruel.
Husbands, and wives have been arrested separately and
takenlin “home1ands” hundreds of miles apart. During a
peaceful demonstration insharpesville aga1nst'th_e Pass Law
the police opened fire and 67 Africans were killed,‘ 86 in-
jured. When asked if this incident had any significance the

- officer in command said, "‘Well—we may get better equip-

anti-Vietnam demonstrators, per- ’

haps it could be ignored. But
when one of the main speakers
declared that ‘.‘this turnout is the
true representation of the clean-
cut majority in our University,”
it must be taken seriously.

Furthermore, one banner, a
crude drawing of the stereotype
beatnik, complete with guitar,
proclaimed, “Our school isn’t run
by these.”

Finally, the president of Stu-
dent Government stated that this
rally would serve two purposes:
“It would show American troops
that we are behind them and also
do a lot for the image of the
University.”
concerned more with the image
of the University? This seems
undeniable when, at a seminar
during Parents’ Weekend, the
parents were assured that the
“bearded” activists”

Aren’t we really

were only

one per cent of the student body. ‘

Yet, what kind of image are

2

the students presenting? Perhaps '

‘to the Board of Trustees, they

present a very good American
image, comparable to right wing
organizations. To thinking indi-
viduals, this is somewhat fright-
ening.

If this is indicative of the level

of thinking on this campus, then _

someone has deﬁnitely failed
somewhere. The rally was the low-
est form of propaganda. It was
not in support of troops, in Viet-
nam. Rather," it was protest
against the so-called beatniks. It
was’ simple rabble-rousing.

ment.” This statement epitomizes the attitude of the Ver-'
woerd regime. . A ’

 

The Group Areas Act of 1950 separates the racial

groups geographically. Location is determined by the
amountof Negro ‘heritage of the individual. One of the tests
to establish whether an African is to_be classiﬁed as _a
Black or Colored is the infamous “pencil test. ’ A pencil is
placed in the African’s hair and he is asked to shake his
head. If the pencil stays he is labelled a Black; if the pencil

falls, he is a Colored. '

IN LINE with thepolicy of territorial separation, the
government is proceeding with plans to remove the Afri-
can population of 250,000 in the West Cape and reserve the
area for Whites and“Co1ored. Out of ..a total population of
17 million approximately 3.5 million are Whites. Yet the
combined land of the African reserves constitute 13\ percent
of’ the total land area; 87 percent reserved for the White
minority. The African reserves contain none of themineral
resources, -none of _ the magor communities or industrial
areas, and no ports. A . _

EVEN IN the schools, Africans are emersed in an at-
mosphere of inferiority. The Whites are ‘determined to seg-
regate education on a basis of race and to indoctrinate non-
Whites into accepting the subservient positions which they
inherit_ at birth. The Ministerof Native Affairs announced
in 1953, “When I have control of- education I will reform it
so that natives will be taught from childhood to-realize. that
equality with Europeans is not for them. People who believe
in equality are not -desirable teachers for the natives."

AFRICANS have no political Voting rights whatsoever.
The type of self-government being granted to them in areas
known as Bantustans can only be described as shams. The
government of Cape Town retains complete control over
matters of defense, external affairs, currency, public loans
and banking, maintenance of internal security and contribu-

‘tion revisions of the Bantustans. The African leaders Vvho

have opposed this governmental structure and social "dis-
crimination have been imprisond and silenced. Others, such

\



as Desai, have taken exile in order to escape “indefinite de- »

tention.” - 1 -
The Black Majority is suppressed both by legal_ amend-
ments of the administration and the general effects of the

apartheid system. These will be discussed in Monday’s ar-VQE

Signer Questions
Petition Purpose

Editor, The Pitt News:

While walking through the
Student Union early last week, I
was stopped, and asked to sign a
petition which, I was told, would
ask the Student Government to
affirm that the students of the
University support the United
States servicemen in Vietnam.

Personally, I do not agree with
the United States government’s
Vietnam policy. However, I do
not approve of those who openly
break the law by’ burning draft
cards, or who seek to evade their
military obligations by claiming
they are conscientious objectors,
homosexuals, and the like. As a

citizen I feel I have the right to .

disagree with my government's
policies—but I also have the duty
to serve -my country when serv-
ice is required.

I noticed, from the news cov-
erage, that some of the recent
anti - Vietnam «policy demonstra—'
tions not only condemned the
policy makers, but also the serv-
icemen in Vietnam as well. I
felt that a petition indicating that

. college students hacf not “turned

against” the men serving in Viet-‘
nam would give some moral sup-
port to these men who, after all,
are not policy makers but rather

are acting in accordance with \

Letters To The Editor

the requirements of citizenship.
So, after being verbally reassured
that the petition was not one of
support "of the U.S. policy in
Vietnam, I signed the petition.

I was quite surprised to read
in the Pittsburgh Press that ,“a
petition containing some 3,000
signatures urging Student Gov-
ernment to affirm its commit-
ment in support of U.S. policy
in Vietnam will be sent . . . to
President Johnson and the De-
fense Dept.” The radio and tele-
vision reports concerning the pe-

tition conveyed the same mess-
age—that the petition is in sup-
port of U.S. policy.

I am left to wonder if those
who circulated the petition pur-
posely misrepresented it as a
statement of support for the serv-
icemen, when it actually was in
support of government policy. If
this misrepresentation was delib-
erate, I would be inclined to
think of those who circulated the
petition as being just as repre-
hensible as those who burn their
draft cards — neither action is

consistent with the expected be-

the petition, those who worked

Penn States cross—country
team will be a prohibitive
favorite to whip the Pan-
thers at State College today.
But, when these two rivals
meet, no matter what the
sport, the form book usually goes

‘right out the window.

H.’
C

The boys from Mt. Nittany are
the second best cross-country
squad in the East, based on past
performances. In ﬁve meets, they
have only a close loss to George-
itown, defending IC4A champs, to
mar their record. They i have
beaten West Virginia and Syra-

cuse handily, while winning two A

close meets over Navy and Villa-
nova. The loss that Villanova
suffered was their only one in
the past seven years.

The harriers and Lions have
met two common foes. Both de-
feated West Virginia easily, but
Penn State beat Navy, 27-28, and
Pitt lost to them, 17-42.

Penn State Coach John Lucas
feels he has three ﬁne runners
in Chuck’ Leuthold,‘ Art Morris
and Bill Pfeiffer. Leuthold is the
captain and number one man,
but Morris has beaten him in the
last two meets. Pfeiffer has been
the third man for State all sea-
son.

could offset the top three Staters,
which could make the fourth and
ﬁfth men the crucial factors in
the meet. Eichenlaub is conﬁdent
that a victory can be had. Han-
delman, who has been coming on
strong lately, is more enthusias-
tic. “I think we’ll beat State,”
said Handelman. “If all the boys
decide to pull together we can
upset them.”

The Panthers need a win to

‘even their record at 3-3. This is

the ﬁnal meet of the year, and
a win over Penn State just might
make it a successful season.

Ahead; Phi? Ep Tops Delts

There was little intramur_

I a1- football action early this-

week as only three games
were played. In Dorm league
contests, Tuesday, Haw-

thorn House whipped Suth-
erland, 27-12, and Panther House
topped the House of Lords, 15-0.
Wednesday, Phi Epsilon Pi edged
Delta Tau‘ Delta, 12-6.
Hawthorne scored once in every
period and pulled away from a
6-6 tie. Steve Solnoki threw two
40-yard touchdowns and ran for
a 30-yarder. Bob Patryllo aided
both Panther TD’s, ﬁring a ﬁve
yard pass to Ron Homak in the
second quarter and running ﬁve

yards for a score in the third

period following Chris Mitchell's
interception. Phi Ep and Delts
battled into overtime tied, 6-6.
Andy Wiener scored the win-
ning TD on a 60-yard run.

the Dental School team, 22-0.

ledged letdown against Navy last
week after the big win over
Southern California, the ﬁghting
Irish only managed a 29-3 win.
The same Middie team shutout
the Panthers, 12-0.

The Notre Dame backﬁeld of
Bill Wolski, Larry Conjar, Nick
Eddy and Bill Zloch has gained
1,114 yards rushing thus far this
season..Of the 412 offensive plays
run off by the Irish, 345 have
been on the ground.

“We won't ﬁnd a better back-
ﬁeld all year,” said Joe Pulle-
kinens, who has scouted the
Irish. “They like to ram that ball
right at you. They’re just as
good this year as they were last
year. Then, it was the passing
game that scared you, now it's
the running game?’

For the Panthers tomorrow
their offense will mainly be in
the air. Quarterback Kenny Lu-
cas has now set two school rec-
ords——yards gained by passing

By TOM SACKS
It was last year at this-
time that Notre Dame, un-
defeated and ranked number
one nationally, invaded Pan-
ther stadium to play a team
that had ‘only notched two
victories. The Irish narrow-
ly averted an upset, 17-15.
The gridders are hoping to-
. morrow’s game at 1:30 p.m. in
the Stadium will be a similar tale.
The big question is whether a
keyed up Panther team will be
enough to stop the best running
team in the country. It’s even
questionable if the Panthers are
capable of getting excited about
anything after last weeks 51-13
A loss to Syracuse.
.1» One factor in the gridders’ fav-
’ or is that the Irish already have
their eyes set on their Nov. 20
battle with unbeaten Michigan
State. However, in their acknow-

BARRY McKNIGHT and other Panther blockers clear way for
running play against Miami. Their job will be muchharder with the
big, experienced glrish Line.

for one season (1,419) and for
career (2,155). Lucas will be the
second outstanding passer Notre.
Dame has met this season. The
other was Purdue’s Bob Greise.

Greise completed 19 of 22 pass-
es that day and dealt the Irish
their only defeat thus far. Greise
was that type of scrambler that
could evade their blitzing line-
backers and still manage to
throw the ball. Lucas will not be
able to rely on his running abil-
ity tomorrow if he is hard press-
ed. It will be up to the offensive
line to provide some type of pro-
tection. The last time they didn’t,
against Navy, the offense was
shut out.

Notre Dame coach Ara Parseg-
hian in anticipation of a passing
attack has been working on his
pass defense for the past week.
His three deep men are Tom
Longo, Tony Carey and Nick
Rassas. This is the second year
they’ve worked together as a unit.

played at 9:30 Sunday morning
at Schenley Oval, before 10 or
12 wildly enthusiastic fans. The
promoters for the bowl game
were able to lineup two Schen-
ley Hall powerhouses, The Pitt
News Hawks and The Owl Owls.
The Owls will be out on a limb
from the start when George
“Moustachio” Lies unlimbers his
arm forra few touchdown tosses.
Frank “Wimpy” Smizik will be
his prime target. Smizik was All-
Eastern Intercollegiate Y ell o w
Journalism Conference pick in
his sophomore year, but didn’t
play last season due to jaundice.
Several new faces will be pre-
sent in the Hawk line-up. Jay
“F1atbush” Rosenstein and Tom
“Alabama” Sacks will be other
receivers Moustachio will be
throwing to. Neither one is very
good, but they are both psyched
up for the game.

-25 James Dodaro (200)

The key to their defense is left
tackle Pete Duranko, according
to Pullekines. He has made 54
tackles, second only to lineback-
er Jim Lynch’s 67. Rassas has in-
tercepted ﬁve passes and has re.-
turned them for a total of 162
yards.

Notre Dame’s Tom Regner and
Dick Arrington split the chores
in playing both ways. Regner is
left guard on offense and Ar-
rington is right guard. They al-
ternate at the right tackle spot
on defense. Arrington is regard-
ed by many as the’ strongest per-

_son to ever play football at Notre

Dame.

Injuries to key Panthers might
make the Irish’s defensive work
load a lot easier tomorrow. Start-
ing ends Mitch Zalnasky and
Mickey Rosborough have both
been hobbled by pulled groin
muscles. Coach John Michelosen
expects that they’ll both be ready
for action, however.

  Gr-idders Seek To Surprise Irish

Michelosen’s biggest problem

‘right now, besides trying to for-

“i.

get the score of last week’s game, A

is coming up with the best for-
mula for containing Eddy, Con-
jar and Wolski. He. ean’t afford
to key on just one or two be.
cause all three are equally dan-
gerous. Last Saturday, the Pan-
thers attempted to key on Syra-
cuse’s Floyd Little and he still
managed to score four touch-
downs.

“After the game I thoughtthat
a hurricane had just gone through
us,” said Michelosen. “After ana-
lyzing it this week I realized it
was really a steamroller. Little
was the best back I've seen in a
long, long time.”

Concerning Notre Dame, Mich-
elosen had said, “They play like
professionals.” Even profession-

als are capable of making mis- 2

takes and for the Panthers’ sake
it might be Notre Dame’s turn
tomorrow.
