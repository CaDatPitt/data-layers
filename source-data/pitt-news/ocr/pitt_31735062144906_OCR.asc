PLEDGE 64 MEN TO
PITT F RATERNITIES

End -of Two-Weeks Rushing
Results in Comparatively
Small Pledgee Group

 

 

Pledging of sixty-four men by ﬁf-
teen social fraternities, has been
announced at the conclusion of a
two weeks rushing period which
ended Sunday.

Pledging is not complete at this
time, further bids being under con-
sideration for acceptance scheduled
for announcement later. The rush-
ing season just ended is the last un-
der the present system, in accord-
ance with plans under consideration
by Interfraternity Council. Begin-
ning next fall, rushing will be de-
ferred until the second semester and
pledging will be by means of prefer-
ential bidding.

As a result of the small number
of new students registering in mid-
term, second semester rushing has
not been on as large a scale as the
fall rushing and the number pledged
is correspondingly lighter. Groups
of pledges named at this time con-
sist largel of those who have de-
ferred aﬁi iation, with fraternities
until the second semester. Frater-
nities and men pledged are:

Steady Decrease of Marriages Is Due
To Scarcity of Old Fashioned Girls

By Sidney Eiges

Leap Year hath lost its charms,
or, as Joe College would say it,
“Women aren’t so hot any more.”
For those who are more intelligent
we might say that the-.~Malthusian
Theory of Population is at work.

All in all, it means that in Janu-
ary _last year there were twenty
marriages: more than in January of
this year. All of which is all wrong.
This is leap year when the hearts of
the weaker and vacillating males are
caught in t.he snares laid by the
tenacious members of the opposite
sex. Either the snares are not well
laid or the male has become domi-
nant and sly enough to escape the
dreaded clutches of the cave woman.
Believe us, this is true if statistics
mean anything.

Last Leap Year in 1924 during
the month of January the clerk at
the Marriage License Bureau down
town said, “This way, please/" to
851 blushing couples. And to the
best of his knowledge all 851 were
joined in the holy bonds of matri-
mony. But 10! a change appears.
In 1925 only 829 prepared to meet
life together on a. twenty-ﬁve dollar
salary and January, 1926, saw only
794 marriage licenses leave the of-
ﬁce of the bureau. Last year in
January it was only 721 and, woe of
woes, this year it is only 701. All
of which proves what?

It might prove that Judge Lindsey
has so terriﬁed the heart of youth
that he is afraid to take the fatal
(it often is) step. Or maybe “Sat-
urday’s Children” has had some ef-
fect on the young ’uns. But really,

folks, it’s a sad state of affairs even
tl_iougl_i.Professor Ross and his so-
ciologist friends think that it is a
good thing for those who will have
to ﬁght for a small bit of “standing
room.” A sheer drop of 150 from
one leap year to the other is not to
be sneezed at. And neither is the
proportionate decline in revenues at
the Marriage License Bureau. Our
economic “prof” told us that in this
day when the laborer is being op-
pressed (c. f. Liberal Club) and
wages are low, people marry less
when they are much older and have
fewer children than usual, so that,
according to the economist, Malthus,
they can reduce the supply of labor
and force wages up. But these
things do not interest us. We have
established a fact. Marriages are on
the decline. Why?

Here's why. Woman has lost her
charm. No longer can she beckon
and nod to the opposite sex and en-
slave these noble souls. Man has
arisen. He had nothing to lose but
his chains; and he lost them. (Re-
ports have it around Craig and Cen-
ter.) The gentry has suddenly real-
ized that doll faces mean apartments
and frigidaires which in turn mean
dollars and plenty of them. The
trend is now toward the old-fash-
ioned girl, the girl who can boil an
egg and turn a ﬂapjack without
breaking the pan. Here’s the secret
of the matrimonial decline. The old-
fashioned girl is hard to find. They
are few and far between. But,
economically speaking, demand in-
gasses supply. So let’s hope for the

' Heeding the request of the depart-
ment of economics and following the
lead set two years ago by the college
when it established “honors,” faculty
members of the school of business
administration officially approved a
system of honor courses for the de-
partment of economics late Monday
afternoon. The courses will be in-

Who Doesn't Appear

“Wanted: Someone to escort.”

Pitt's R. O. T. C. unit suffered its
second disappointment in two years
during the dedicatory parade mark-
ing the opening of the Stanley Thea-
ter Monday. Selected to escort
Mayor Charles H. Kline from the
Court House down Sixth street to the
new theater, the unit traveled by
truck to the city, marched en masse
to the Court House to await His
Honor, and stamped numbed feet for
ﬁfteen minutes. Along the line of
waiting men, ominous whispers
began to travel. Someone hinted
that the mayor had gone: ahead. The
appearance of somebody, not His
Honor, confirmed the rumor. He
was gone!

Last year the corps was prepared
for a reception to Queen Marie of
Roumania that never happened. A
pair of theater tickets is the reward
for chilblains and frost-nipped pedal
extremities suffered by Pitt cadets.

Buzzing Telephone Brings First Signs of
Spring to Teachers’ Appointment Bureau

So spring comes to the Pitt teach-
ers appointment bureau. The tele-
phone rings and from a long dis-

tance comes a business-like voice.‘

This perhaps is the conversation:

“This is. . . . .,of. . . . . I want the
best teacher I can find to_ teach
mathematics and science in my
high school.”

‘Ve well. What requirements
must s e meet?”

“She must be a man; must have
reasonably high scholarshi , a pleas-
ing personality, at least t ree years
of successful teaching experience,
and must be able to coach athletics.”

“I think we have the very person
you need. What salary will you be
able to pay?”

“For the ‘right man’ I can pay
as high as $1,650 or even possi-

bly $1,700, but it must be the
‘right man’ for the job.”
“Thank you. We will try to

ﬁnd the right candidate for you at
once.”
Hurray!
lucky man.
While the record is bein made
for this position other ca ls, for
teachers come in by telephone. This
time it is a call for a woman who
is needed to teach English, botany,
and perhaps a little history—one
who is also capable of coaching the
senior play. Salary, $1,300. At
this moment the mailman delivers a
large package of _letters in which
there are several more requests for
teachers, and before the contents of
these letters are digested a large
and important superintendent or
two ‘drops in’ to, talk over possi-
ble candidates. Sttarcely is he sat-

A position for another

isﬁed and on the way to being
bowed; out ‘through the narrow trip-
ping passage between the chairs and
the corner, when an eager-eyed sen-
ior slips into the same corner via the
opening between the swivel chair
and the desk, and laughs humor-
ously at his own success in ‘at-
riving.’

“Just came in to see if you have
found me a position yet.”

“Let me see....you are Mr.....,
and you are interested in teaching
history and social science, aren’t
you.” V

A quick glance over. the list of
positions to be ﬁlled fails to un-

to 12,000 with a proportionate in-
crease iii the faculty. Johnstown

The Secretary was much impres-
sed with the fine equipment provided
at Johnstown for the Junior Col-
lege, and with the enthusiasm and
spirit of Dean Crawford and all the
students there. The Junior College
is a miniature University, with all
the “trimmings,” from the fresh-
men who wear their “dinks" to
cheerleaders, a good orchestra and,
last but not least, a number of fair
co-eds. The Junior College is un-
doubtedly a great asset to Johns-
town and to-the University, and the
alumni of the Flood City are na-
turally enthusiastic over. it.

the following to say about the affair:

“The Pittsburgh ‘group made

a splendid impression. There

were many favorable remarks

passed relating to the Chancel-

clean cut group of boys who ac-
companied them. The Philadel-

fact that these gentlemen sac-
riﬁced the week-end to make the
trip and -that they were so un-
selﬁsh in allowing us to lmP°89

they were here. They may, how-
ever, feel some satisfaction in

knowin that their visit did a

great cal ‘to stimulate enthu-

ISSUE MOST GUIDANCE
CERTIFICATES AT PITT

University Leads 63 Other
Colleges In State of
Pennsylvania

For the last ﬁve years Pitt has
led 63 colleges in Pennsylvania in
the number of provisional guidance
certificates issued to graduates, hav-
ing received approximately one-tenth
of the total number issued.

Graduates of the school of educa-
tion of the University havegreceived
a total of .965 Provisional College
Certiﬁcates of the 9,673 issued by
the State Department of Education
within‘ the last seven years. This
is the. largest number of certiﬁcates
which has been issued to the gradu-
ates of any college in the state and
is approximated only by a total of
887 which were granted to graduates
of the University of Pennsylvania.

The Provisional Certiﬁcate is

granted to those students in the
School of Education who have been
graduated with a B. A. degree» and
who have had eighteen credits of
work in" secondary education, twelve
of which must have been in practice
teaching. The holder of a provi-
sional- certiﬁcate is privileged to
teach in high schools or schools of
equivalent standing. _
' In 1921 sixty-three such certiﬁ-
cates weregranted to Pitt gradu-
ates. This number increased to 86
in '1922, -remained 86 in 1923,
mounted to 123 in 1924, 146 in 1925,
209 in 1926‘ and 252 in 1927, making
a total of 965. The University of
Pennsylvania graduates -followed
with 887 and the three following
highest are Pennsylvania'State Col-
lege with 840 certiﬁcates, Bucknell
University with 585, and _Mar wood
College‘_with 392. Provisions Cer-
tiﬁcates are granted only to_g_'radu-
ates of colleges and universities in
Pennsylvania which have been recog-
nized and accredited by the State
Council of Education. ‘

VALUE OF LEARNING
LIES IN USEFULNESS

Dr. T. R. Courtice Speaks
Against ‘Monetary’
Education

 

 

“The value of an education is not

A ‘to insure a steady and bountiful in-

come, but its usefulnessis to offer
service to others,” stated Dr. T. R.
Oakland
Methodist Church at chapel services
held in Heinz house. J. Frederick
Baler, instructor in mathematics.

~ presided.

“Burn the midnight oil" advised
Dr. Courtice in classifying college
students into two types. These
types are represented by those con-
tent with getting by, who make col-
lege a round of social affairs and
a riot of athletic’ activities, and the
other type which believes that life is
worthwhile only as long as people
work and work hard, said Dr. Cour-
rice.

“There is no royal road to learn-
ing,” said Dr. Courtice. “Excellence
cannot be attained without labor.
Nor is labor put forth because 01
any monetary reasons.”

Education pays especially at ‘the
time of a crisis. “It is at a critical

give his best, and make a contribu-
tion that is helpful and truly worth-
while,” the speaker concluded.

CHOLARS have passed on with the ages. No
longer do they present an awe-inspiring ideal
to their neighbors; no longer are they the

V, Practicahility seems to be the cause of‘ such an
I; evolutionary change. The necessity of earning a-
" living has required that the delving into‘ musty

‘f oryacquired during undergraduate days. Limit-

_, 3  an education to four years has been made

necessary in many cases due to economic changes
if tending toward a higher living scale.
 Looking at the matter from a different‘ angle,

BABBITT. PH. D.
INCLAIR Lewis, if we are
misinformed, is now writ-
ing’: portrait of an Ameri-
wzaneducatortoadd tohisgal-
lay of Babbitt, Arrowsmith,
and Elmer Gantry. When that
portrait arrive some readers
will remember elson Antrim
Crawford's A Man of Learning
(Little, Brown, $2.50), subtitled
"A Half Century of Educa-
tional Service as Exempliiied
by Arthur Patrick Redﬂeld,
Pb. 13., ‘LL. D.” Lewis, it is
probable, with his splash and
vigor and bite, will make Mr.
Crawford seem a gentle and ob-
vious satirist. But the icon-
busting in A Man of Learning

is sumcientunto the day.
Doctor Rediield--doctor by
virtue of anhonorary degree---
with his natural modesty, dep-
recated the ‘writing of his biog-
raphy. “What I have accom-
plished," he said, "does not de-
serve any encomium. . . .I
have done it all merely as part
of .my duty to this great Na-
tion, to the divinity which
youth represents, and to the
noble cause of education. I
have done it in the spirit of

Service, not Self.” Now we ask:

you---—?

Thls Babbitt in the educat-
ing business—Mr'. Crawford, of
course, never as much as inti-
mates that he is a Babbitt-—
was born in Decorah, Indiana.
When he went to’ college, he
joined the Chi Delts, because
they “were the men who held
the>univcl‘sity oﬁices.” He was
active in the Y. M. C. A. and,
barred liquor from} the Junior
Prom by the eloquence of his
plea that the womanhood of In-
diana be unsullied by‘ the odor
of whisky.

A His earnestness, diplomacy;
and Christian views brought
him a professorship in pedagogy
in a small denominational col-_
lege. From this he rose to a
deanship in his Alma Mater.
Before , many years the‘ “pro-

fessor that's a reel he-man’' '

was a university president.
e e e _
was he who drst ‘applied
ITthe magic word “Service” to
education. The word, by the
way, appears 2,463 times in his
speeches, followed closely by
“Idealism,” “Conatructivcneas,”
“Optimism,” “Practical.” and
“Leadership.” *
“So thorough a master of
the teaching process was he.”
Biographer Crawford records,
“that no student ever failed.
Indeed, in 1910-11, 311 of DOO-
tor Redﬁeld’s 342 students air‘
tained a rating of A,'8O of B,
and 1 of C.” The 0 student,
it later developed, had been
registered by mistake and had
never attended. “Doctor ,Red-
ﬁeld, although he had noticed
that the student appeared to be
deﬁcient in banding in required
papers, had felt, in making up
the grades, that some error
might have been made in his
own records. and with A his‘
scrupulous sense of justice
gave the young man the bone-
fit of the doubt.”

As an antidote, investigate

the behavior of-Alexander Mie-
klejohn, Ernest,‘ Martin, Hop-

. kins, Glenn Frank, Hamilton

Holt, and the later Nicholas.
Murray Butler.

Mr. Crawford, formerly or the; *

University of Kansas, is direc-

cellor of the Quill. club, he in-

stalled the local rune in 1921.

nation is merely a part of a

PITTSBURGH

All doubts should now be dis-
polled. Sunday nisht. at the
Moeque, the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Bociety. with Margery
Maxwell as soloist gave its ﬂrst
concert to the largest crowd I
have seen in‘ the hall all season.
Those who were pessimistic
about or antagonistic to its ex-

~ ietence are silenced. The orches-

tra is a reality. Whether or
not it will be permanent will
depend on the..public support.
Richard Hageman, no strang-
er to Pittsburgh, was guest con-
ductor. But the honors for the
concert do not go to the ‘con-
ductor. They go'to Elias Breas-
kin, isaociate . conductor, who,
trained the orchestra, and to the
players themselves.“ It is no
easy thing for a society that
has fought so long for its very
existence to give a concert to
an audience who is expecting
much. But the audience was
not disappointed. Considering
the circumstances, they gave a
concert that can compare with

' any of _those given by the visit-.

ing orchestras.

A certain ensemble powerwas
lacking, but that can only ‘come
after the orchestra has been
playing together for several
years. Orchestras are like old
wines, in- that they mellow only

with age. Except for an occa-

sional flaw in the brass choir,’
the orchestra was technically
impeccable, but the strict disci-
pline which they have had to
undergo Vas a little too ap-
parent. '

If I wanted to find bones to.

pick, I should start on the pro- -

gram., I realize that conditions
were ‘most’ unfavorable, because
of the diillculty of constant

rehearsal, but surely a less cut- '

and-dried program could have
been selected. Was the commit-
tee uncertain as to what the
Pittsburgh. public would ac-
cept, or did it feel’ that the peo-
ple could get better‘ acquainted
with its ‘-orchestra whenfplayirig
a familiar program?
Beethoven's Leonora No. 1
Overture, the opening number
on the program, ‘showed-tithe
atringsection to a good advan-
tage. Tschalkovsky’s Sym-
‘ phony in F Minor‘ proclaimed
the merits of the entire body.
The military themes in the drst
and last movements proved the
brasses, the folkaong in the
second,.:th_e strings, and the
third movement, the A wood-
winds. _It was in the sym-
phony that the’ lack of power

" HOW TO WRITE A COLUMN

N addition to superhuman intelligence, beauty, are

air of sovoir oivre, and a dictionary,  acol-

umn takes a lot of drag. That is, of course. if
your want to write a real column. Folks content to
specialise in music, books, and literary gems need only
to write their stuff down and the editor prints it be-
dug‘. than are not enough advertisements to ﬁll out
the issue; but a real column, understand, a real col-
umn is one of the most important features of the
paper and the editor has to be very careful about who
writes it. Accordingly, he restricts the competition to
the fellows who lend him money, feed him cigarettes,"
and laugh at his jokes. No others need apply..

And there was Kate Jonson. wife of Ben Jonson.

epitome and embodiment of ill-treated womanhood.

She sat quietly on the edge of a still’ oilice chair. and her son,

monotonous voice, no attempt to dramatize even the most’ appealing
situation, no self pity, no protest. Piling up impressions," unconscious-

The Terrible Child

The door in the painted imitation-marble arch of the old, discreet
looking house opened. slowly of its own accord, with a series of
little jerks. And then, still claeping the high door knob, a little
boy with excited round eyes shining in his rosy brown face, slipped
out-.

Pulling the door almost to behind him, he sat down on the well-
scrubbed steps First he plac_ed"his feet, in their polished patent
leather pumps, close together: then. srrenglngﬁhls. tassellsd string
tie to his satisfaction and smoothing down the‘ sleeves of his neat
blue wash suit-, he looked’ out into the street. -

Fullerton street that day‘ was no worse than usual. The inter-
mittent coming and going of rumbling street ‘cars made a gaudy
caravan in the soot-darkened. odorous thoroughfare, where the cobble-
stones were plastered with black crushed bits of newspapers and
ﬂattened cigarette stubs. Enllvening pictures» of rubbish wagons,
containing all kinds of desirable odds and ends, attracted the boy's
attention, and his bright eyes shone as he watched the big trucks

crashing past with their brown tarpaulin covers flapping and waving‘

from side to side. ‘‘ .
. He did not remain alone, however, for any length of time. An-
other small boy, sidling along the wall, addressed him: '

“Hello there, sheik!”

“What?” The little boy in the wash suit could only stars. And
you would have stared too, if you ‘had seen the queer sight. The
stranger wore a pair of grimy mill pants‘ rolled -up into two bulbous
knots at the bottom; the upper part. bagging out in the most comical
fashion, was caught around a small waist with a red cloth belt. A
striped green vest over a coffee shirt disaied the eye; then a
scrawny black neck supported the ‘happiest; jolliest face‘ you ever
saw. It was a face shining like the sunshine through its scaly and
wonderfully unwashed skin. ‘But the gleaming white teeth. separated

far and between. and the roguish eyes were eclipsed by hiacrownlng.

glory; his headgear was a round felt can. Dunctured with holes
through which his black hair stood out like knotted tangles dusty
silk. And on the can he wore dashingly a feather from a rooster’:
tall.

‘‘I was only saying good. afternoon, my boy.
I'm, the Kid himself."
“Quite pleased to meet you.” quickly answered the well-taught

“and my name is William. I just slipped out to watch every-
thing.”

“Right-o, Sir William.

Meet the wonder

And Pm the juger that can tell you all
about everything.” Thus, the precocious imp. “Why, look’a there,
at that there organ grinder man. He makes a lot of money playing
that music box. An’ that danged bird of his’n,-yes, that green
parrit trying to pick its feathers and look wise,—I’m going to wring
that bird's neck. Why, yesterday when I was peeping into its coop.
it took a peek at me, and ate a part of my own face.” And, true
enough, he showed a little red mark on his cheek.

Looking down the street, he jumped up and said, “—-But wait a
min’ ho, till I get that good weiner that Old Joe «let drop into the
street.”

He ran across the street, picked up something, wiped it on his
sleeve, slipped it into his mouth, and darted back.

“Don’t you know, sweet William, that reminds me of that old-
time joke ‘bout Jasper and the Fish. P’raps you've heard it. No 2-

DISCUSSES LAW
ENFORCEMENT ON
RADIO PROGRAM

The subjects of law and law en-
forcement and the functions of the
American Federation of Labor as
given by Roscoe Pound, dean of
Harvard law school, and William
Green, head of American labor
forces, were discussed recently by
Dr. Louis K. Manley, dean of the
school of business administration,
over the University studio of
KDKA.

The difficulty of law adjustment
with rapidly growing society and
the fallacies of the present day jury

system were discussed by Dean
Pound in the interview given Dr.
Manley. “In' law, as ‘every here
else, we have to learn by a p ocess
of trial and error” said Dean
Pound. “Much legislation has had
to be experiments , and the result
has been to make us suspicious of
needed legislation and to weaken
the hold of law upon the popular
imagination just at the time when
it was most tried and most in need
of strong support. Yet this society
demands legislation _to make clear
what may be done and what may
not. Le islation does for conduct
in many elds what the lines in the
middle of the road and lines upon
the street crossings do for the driver
of the automobile.” _
According to Dean Pound, the
administration of {ustice through a
jury is a surviva
days when fury “appealed to the
pioneer’: fee ing that any man was
competent to do anything. In
those days, the member of a ury
was acquainted with his.neigh or-
hood and community, and could,
therefore, judge fairly the dealings
and conduct of his neighbors. To-
day, when each city‘ dwe let's experi-'
ence is limited to is office, shop or
desk it is highly improbable that he
can deal justly in cases involving
country-wide transactions or details
with which onl a specialist may
wrestle effective y.” .
DEFINES WORK OF A. F. OF L.
Mr. Green, who is president of the
Federation, states in an interview
that the A. F. of L. is not properly
understood as to the place it fills in
the industrial world. In the opinion
of Mr. Green it is the parent organi-
aation, fostering the growth of many
small unions that are within them-
selves completely autonomous. “The
aim of the Federation is to sponsor

ers,” Mr. Green told Dean Manley.
“At first this meant real wages, that
is, wages that bu more. Now they
are seeking hig er social wages,
that is, those which increase as
measured b price and productivity.”

The pres dent of the Federation
maintains that there is no power
able to keep workers from organiz-
ing into trade unions. “Opposition
to organization only inspires it to
greater efforts," he said. The great-

employment, could be eliminated, ac-
rdlng to Mr. Green, if the prob-
lem would be treated scientiﬁcally.
The illegitimate use of injunctions
by o rators to keep employee from
form ng into unions was deplored
by the labor leader. An appeal for

rotection from this instrument of
notice will ‘be made during the pres-

"the difficulties of organizing the

reason why in is not easy to organise

as spcateer, expecting later to enter

Mr. Green wants it distinctly un-

ﬁnds the true_ pathos and sadness‘
expressed in his supposedly humor-
ous publications.

In speaking of Helen of Troy,‘

I

Erskine said: “Helen never real y

Menelaus, who real-
ized that Helen knew no codes of
morality, refrained from killing her,’
since he understood that she had‘
never been fascinated by any man
as ‘her swains were attracted by her.
Erskine concluded his discussion of
Helen of Troy by saying, “I thought
I was writing a. tra ‘c story.

“I do not think t at I have de-
stroyed the beautg of ‘Galahad;’ I
was only worried y the attitude of
Tennyson in creating characters
without sin,” Erskine said. That the
ieneral public prefers to believe that

ing Arthur was a noble character, .
void of all tern tations, is a pretty
story, but hard y accurate, brou ht
out the speaker. “I. would rat er
believe that Galahad’s father.
Lancelot, ‘did all the noble acts,
while the sovereign sat back and
grew fat," Erskine contended. Ten-
nyson depicted Guinevere as a serene
and well possessed‘ person, but “I
cannot conceive of a woman of her
type not showing some form of"
nervousness when carrying on an af-
fair as she did with Lancelot,“
opinioned Erskine. Guinevere, who
was disappointed in Arthur as a bus-
band, since he was already a. great
man, tried to inspire Lancelot to
deeds of valor, but was again cheat-
ed in her purpose. She then prac-
ticed her wiles on Galahad, who
proved an apt pupil to her teachings.
-To be original was then the ultimate

more than a spoiled child and paidi

object of the pedagogue, who plans ’
to rear Galahad in ignorance of ~

worldly affairs. Galahad learns the
relationship of his father with his
ideal, Guinevere, and disappears.
Erskine related this story in order
to bring out the questions of modern
morality, “whichis really very old
morality.” ,
“I believe that ‘Adam and’ Eve’
is my best book,” said Erskine. “l
conferred brains on Eve, something
that no author ever did.” Erskmel
accepts Darwin's theory, since he,
holds that God created .evolu,tion.:

3 “Perhaps this book of mine istool

subtle; that may account for the fact
that it is not as popular as my other
writings,” said the author. That it
is easy for a writer to draw his
characters all bad, wasbrought out
by ..the speaker, but to present the
principals as he truly sees them is
a tas .

F .-. .“ln.ethics we speak of ‘morals as a«
problem of conduct. "I‘do'not'a;greeT
with this view, for I hold that morals '
are not a question of conduct, but of
character,” emphasized Erskine.‘

ESTABLISH HONORS
COURSES IN BUS. AD.
ECONOMICS DIVISION

(Continued from Page 1)

considered by faculty members to
affect the students who are capable
and desirous of doing advanced
work in ﬁelds in which they are in-
terested. These students will be di-

rected in their outside work and in
exceptional cases sophomores will be
permitted to elect the honors courses.
Students will be graded both as to
credits carried and grades earned in
the course. This system will pre-
vent students’ c a r r y i ii g excess
credits, it is believed.

The plan for honors courses which
has been in eﬁect at numerous other
colleges differs at the same time
from these other plans in being
adapted to work in a school of busi-
ness administration. I-Ieretofore,
honors courses have been given only
V in liberal arts colleges. .

Dr. Louis K. Manley, dean of the
school of business administration,
enthusiastically approves the action
taken injthe establishment of the
honors courses, saying that “too
little attention has been given to
superior students heretofore.

“Now. there will be closer contacts
between student and professor. No
longer is there the‘ danger of rou-
tine which the average, student is
likely to meet in his regular course
of studies. The student will now
have independence in his work also.”

The plan is not “novel.” Dr. Man-
ley explains. The trend today is to
try‘ out the plan generally, he says.
He approves the widening of the
scope of honors courses to include
juniors, seniors, sophomores and in
' some instances, even freshmen. How-
ever, the plan is less applicable to
freshmen for the reason, Dr. Manley
points out, that the ability of fresh-
men to undertake honors courses is
not known and therefore they ought
not be permitted to experiment. .

Dr. M. K. McKay, professor of
economics, holds that the “honors
courses will develop interests of
students in special ﬁelds of work
and will aid in the development of
assistants in the department. Stu-
dents in these courses will be re-
‘lievedfrom attendance at classes and
will-. be enabled to concentrate on
their outside reading in the courses.”

The extension of honors courses to
the school of business administration
13 ‘heartily approved by Dr. Lee P.
»'Sieg,, de‘an'of the college, -the ﬁrst
campus school to introduce honors
courses. “I believe that in ‘the fu-
ture we shall have more and more
students taking courses, until at
least half the student body comes to
elect .them,”' he said. The courses
will in time be extended in scope.”
Dean Sieg would make no comment
as to ‘whether other campus schools
will introduce, honors .cou_,rses,,

Nooappointrnents to the committee
on honors .co‘urses has as yet been
made in the school of busi~ness’ad-
ministration.’

at Pitt.”

Dr. S. B. Liuliart, secretary of the
University, likewise favors the plan.
“The idea is a good one," he says.
“Our crowded commencement pro-
gram has not permitted us to give
enough time to such social events
as these. Senior Week would give
each a sufficient amount of time.”

“It’s a fine thing" in the opinion
of John R. Johnston, graduate man-
ager of student activities. He re-
fused to comment further because
of the fact that he originally sug-
gested the plan and felt that he
would rather have expressions of
opinion from others.

Prefacing his remarks with com-
ments on the obsolete Pitt Week
which he disapproved, Dean Louis
K. Manley of the school of business
administration added his approval of
the plan of Senior Week. “The in-

he said. “I objected to the way it
was organized and the migratory
dance was also objectionable. The
idea of a Senior ‘-Week appeals to
me a lot. I really think the idea
of working out a constructive pro-
gram for Senior Week is an excel
lent one.” , , I

Chancellor Bowman declined to
give his opinion on Senior Week pro-
posals until deﬁnite plans are an-
nounced. Members of the commit-
tee decline to express opinions on
the matter until constructive plans
have been approved at the meeting
tonight.

ous changes wrought in art by the
French Revolution and. modern in-
vention. “The patrons of art today
are great men in industry,” he said
in his talk. Professor Sachs be-

 

 

present’ is to bring to man the re-
alization‘ that there‘ ‘is beauty in
everythingrthat man and man-ma_de
machine produce. “Here,” he said,
“the business man can help "us."
American museums _have often been"
asked to aid in business enterprises
and, in the future, these institutions
will extend their inﬂuence.

There is an unfair idea prevalent
that many wealthy patrons. of art
are men who do not appreciate the
worksmf art which they-purchase,
but who are only seeking ways of‘
spending surplus wealth.‘ Professor
Sachs is convinced by his personal
observation that these wea thy pa-

M. trons of art are true lovers of the

beautiful.
Many people hold a mistaken be-
lief that art is only for the wealthy,

thought by these people that the
government should in no way sup-
port institutions of art. Professor
Sachs maintains that today art be-’
longs to the people, and if it be the
purpose of the government to_pro-
mote the welfareof the people, then
no expenditures of the government
for art can be too great.

Professor Sachs lauded the work
of Pittsburgh art patrons for their
work in, extending, the ‘influence of

Rout Vice Presidents In Tilt
Last Saturday Night by
50-19 Score

SHOW WONDERFUL FORM

Coming back once more to their
own, the Pitt Freshman complete-
ly routed the little Presidents 50-
19 in a preliminary game to the var-
sity tilt. Getting away to an early
start the Panther Cubs not only
maintained their lead, but widened
the margin. The Pittites showed
wonderful form and real co-opera-
tion throughout the entire game
sweeping W.-J. off the ﬂoor and per-
mitting them to make good only ﬁve
ﬁeld goals, while their own ball
found its mark nineteen times.

In spite of the lack of competi-
tion so far as scoring goes, there
were many high points in the

sine. Spectacular passing was
eatured by Jacobs and Anderson
while Baker and Krantz led the
Panthers in the number of field
goals, each hanging up six to his
credit. Baker and Cohen did some
wonderful running while Miller
proved formidable for the Presi-
dent's forwards.

The Presidents, however, were
no half-hearted prey for the little
Panthers, but put up a fight which
stop ed the Blue and Gold from
mar in up even a higher score.
The tol taken by fouls, however
was needless] high; Pitt ha
twenty-two cal ed against it and
Wash-Jeﬂ nineteen. The two teams
seemed to be playing and layin
hard, but not especially care ully as
the number of fouls show. Regard-
less of all this, last Saturday night’:

ame was a brilliant victory for the
itt Freshmen, for they cut-
pointed and outplayed the Presi-
dents in every way. .

Honor Roll Grid Star.
Finds Studies Easy‘

Edward Slierako, the University's 9

only combination football player and imam independent lag“ can barf,

honor student, says that football
does not interfere with studies.

“Although during football season
I do not have as much time for my
‘studies as I would like to I can’t see
where football and schooling con-

‘ilict ”

“I' make it a practice to study
everyday a few hours before foot-
ball. drill and complete my work
after football is over. By this plan
I ﬁnd‘ that I can do my" work with-
out ‘burning the midnight oil.’

“Leading a life‘ of training is a
bigger aid to my studies than the
loss of a few hours’ time is a hinder-
since. I ﬁnd that training not only
makes me
makes me a le to concentrate bet-
ter. During training I show‘ more
ambition and enthdsiasm toward. my
work.’’ .

“Although I enjoy going to school
I like to play football and I am quite
anxiousato begin spring training. I
will  out there‘ ﬁghting hard to
earn a position as Pitt’s end.

“I think that next year Pittwill
have one of the best teams in the
school history because there are
some mighty powerful players left.”

Sherako graduated from Plymouth

seminary before entering the Busi-
ness Ad. school at Pitt. He’ was an
honor student in high school and
continued his good work at the Uni-
versity, being on the honor roll four
times in two and a half years.

Carnegie Tech Plains Nosed
Out by Two Points in
Close Game

 is scorer AFFAIR

Last Wednesday. February 22, on
Tech floor the Pitt Frosh once more
overcame the Carnegie Plebes in
the sloppiest game of the season, 27-
25. Neither team showed the same
form that they had exhibited at
previous bouts.

The Scotchmen were the. nrst to
draw, blood, but the Panther soon
found himself with‘ a twelve’-point
lead. In the second half, however,
with the help‘ of Fox, Carlson and
Black the Plebes closed up the gap
between the scores and it was only
by the exceptional playing of Ailleo,
Jacobs and Baker that the Blue and
Gold maintained its supremacy.
Near the end of the last quarter
when Baker was taken out because
of fouls the Scotch almost tamed
the Panther, but a timely field goal
broke the morale. of the, Plaid de-
fenélers and they went dowli to de-
ea .
The game was one which was full
of breaks, but neither side took a -‘
vantage of them. There was litt e
s ectacular or even od playingin
t e entire game wit th _ exception
of » the momentary . raly of the
Plebes. There is little doubt that
if the game had listed five minutes
longer, the Scotchmen would have
found themselves again, and the
story mi ht have been entirely dif-
either team merits much
acclaim, for both uintets played
badly. Baker and acobs led the
attack for Pitt, while Fox and Nease
were the outstanding‘ players for
Tech.

W. A. A.’s novel idea of sb'esket_-
ball sports day, with approximately
one hundred participants, will pro-
mote a spirit- of good sportsmanship
between colleges of western Penn-
sylvania Saturday, Marsha, without
entailing strenuous, concentrated
varsity competition. Twenty-four
girls from P. C. W.', Carnegie Tech,
Slippery Rock and Pitt organised’

 

into sister-class teams, two? from w

each school, will compete for inter-
school basketball supreiiiacy oirthis
date. * '
Much enthusiasm in the several
schools is already aroused. and some

‘fast play‘ is expected when. the

freshman - junior, sophomore- senior
teams of each school  with re-
spective teams from other, schools.
Each school. will bedeaignated by
a particular‘ color carried out-in the
makeup of its costume: Pitt, blue;
Tech,i red ; Slippery Rock, gold, and
.. . W., een. A point system’
similar to t "at used last Play Day
will be employed to determine whic .
school shall be victor of the day.
Three points will be awarded the
winning team of the sister-class
games, and one point for individual
contests in basketball skills; such as
the basketball throw for distance,
the basketball goal throw, etc.
Every girl, whether or‘ not she plays
in a game, will take part in these
skills. » .
The ‘school whose girls f have
of the day will be eclared the victor.
In keeping. with‘ the atmosphere
of the day an informal supperwill
be held at Heinz House with the
participants as guests of honor, and
all W. A. A.'members and faculty
members invited to attend. 2 ‘
The tentative time schedule for
the day' is as follows: 12:30 to 1,,
arrival and reception of teams; 1 to
1 :30, preliminary arrangements, such
as registering, election of captains,
drawing for competition; 1:30 ._ to

SCIENCE’S CINDERELLA
IS HEREDITY, SAYS DR.
IN DEBATE

Opposes Dr. Max Schoen of
Tech In First of “Y”
Forums

Heredity is the Cinderella of sci-
ence because it has not had deserved
attention, said Dr. Roswell Johnson,
head of the department of oil and
gas production, in his debate with
Dr. Max Schoen of Carnegie Tech
at the first open forum of the Y.
M.-W. H. A. Sunday. Dr. Johnson,
nationally known eugenist, took the
affirmative of the question, “Hered-
ity is at least as important as en-
vironment,” while Dr. Schoen, who
is head of the department of psy-
chology at Carnegie Tech, upheld
the negative. Dr. Manuel C. Elmer,
head of the department of sociology
at Pitt, presided. 9

_Dr. Johnson maintained that he-
redity is more fecund—-fecund in the
sense that when a thing is started
a series of events will follow, and
that if it is possible to make par-
ents of the next generation better
than those‘ of this, then environment
must automatically be improved for
improving heredity we improve ev-
erything. Heredity is more neg-
lected because the improvement of
environment has more emotional ap-
peal than the improvement of
heredity. To appreciate the im-
portance of heredity requires knowl-
edge that is hard to get but the
facts of environment is obvious, Dr.
Johnson said. Also concern about
heredity requires a long run solici-

 

neglect heredity and this is the
cause of their breakdown I very
often, he said.

Heredity is at least as pot nt as
environment. The potency of Hered-
ity and environment differ with dif-
ferent traits. Civilization is achieved
by invading peoples and arises at
a point outside the conquered ter-
ritory. Dr. Johnson maintains that
environment does not make great
races; great races have arisen out-
side. Favorable environment, may
or may not make great races. Civ-
ilization goes with races, not?‘ with
environment, and races have had op-
portunity to. accept or‘ reject cul-

‘dia Brittanica were not great. The

tui-_es; so culture is not the cause of
civilization accompanying races. .

As for individual consideration-
environment cannot make similars.
The crucial experiment at the He-
brew orphan asylum in New York
conducted by Gertrude Hildreth,
shows that heredity rather than en-
vironment makes children alike.
Miss Hildreth found that two’ sis-
ters reared together are no more
like each other than two reared
apart. , Of the 680 children examined‘
it was discovered that all. came
from parents, better than nor-
mal, and all were superior in all
traits examined.

Heredit_ is defined as ‘a name
given for the determinate factors of
the individual; internal rather than
external, factors-—thus' given an op-
portunity to discover men greater
than others, said the speaker.

There is no such thing as hered-
ity stated Dr. Schoen. The doctrine
of heredity is no longer a scientific‘
matter, it is an obsession or phobia.
The substance of heredity is the unit
character theory. Dr. H. S. Jen-
nings of Johns Hopkins ‘University
denies this theory, said Dr.
Schoen, while genetics show that
there is no unit character. The study
of the geanealogical trees is a hoax.
Dr. Schoen cited the Edwards case,
saying that Edwards was really a
constitutional psychopath. If Ed-
wardswas great, he maintained, he
should not have been great accord-
ing to the doctrine of heredity be-
cause his family was not great.-

Dr. Jennings shows that ninety
per cent of the outstanding people.
come from parents not outstanding,
Dr. Schoen said. Parents of a
great many people in the Encyclope-

test for the scientiﬁc principle is
its reliability for predicting results
that would follow from certain con-
ditions. Dr. Jennings holds that it
is impossible to predict types of
children. Man and other organisms
