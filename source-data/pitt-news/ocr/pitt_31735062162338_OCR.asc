  Union Remodelling Underway 59>‘ Bias l“ PA T”l”°“5r

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Remodelling of the Student
Union main ﬂoor and a revamping
of- the Union's food service
operation are part of the Univer-
sity’s plan to give the building a
new look. .

The main floor remodelling
currently underway should be
completed by July 1 according to

/¢§'Union Manager Terrence E.

Milani.

New furniture;carpeting and
drapes in the lobby, lower lounge,
Pine and Venetian rooms; an
awning, furniture and lighting for
the outside patio; and a new
antenna in the TV room are
planned for the Union. '

Part of the $110,000 budget for
remodelling by Physical Plant

Maintenance was slated to finance

an ice cream concession in the old
Schenley Cafeteria to replace the
Hunt Room facility. A lack of
patrons has since forced Food
Service Director Thomas Albert's
decision to close the concession.

Milani stated that the main floor
will not be changed by the
proposed Union expansion in order
to preserve the historical value of
Schenley Hall.

Expansion plans now being
considered would involve remodel-
ing all floors in the present Union
and building an addition. This
expansion would not take place for
three to five years.

In discussing the lack of food
service in the Union, Milani'said he
“would like to have food service in
the Union," but added operation of
present facilities is not practical.

Additional Nixon Tapes Subpoenaed

 

 

‘WASHINGTON AP - The House
Judiciary Committee today voted
37 to 1 to subpoena the tapes of 11
presidential conversations for its
impeachment inquiry.

The committe also was consider-
ing- issuing a second subpoena
demanding President Nixon's daily
diaries for 8 1/2 months in 1972
and 1973.

In addition. John Doar, chief
counsel for the impeachment
inquiry told the committee he
would ask it on Thursday to
consider subpoenaing tapes of 62
presidential conversations dealing
with the ITT antitrust settlement
and political contributions from the
dairy industry. '

All of those conversations, as
well as the 11 dealing with the

Watergate break-in and cover-up
were requested by the. committee

  

in a letter delivered to the White
House on April 19. .

James D. St. Clair, President
Nixon_'s chief Watergate lawyer,
subsequently informed Doar that
the President had decided to give
no more Watergate tapes to the
committee.

The conversations subpoenaed
were two on April 4, 1972; six on
June 20, 1972, and three on June
23. 1972.

The only dissenter on the vote for
that subpoena was Rep. Edward
Hutchinson, of Michigan, the
ranking Republican on the commit-
tee. He has opposed all subpoena
moves on the grounds that the
demand would be unenforceable.

After the committee vote, White

House spokesman Gerald Warren .

replace the Second Class County
Code as the law of the county.
Once granted the status of home
rule, the county would have
‘jurisdiction over all matters not
covered under federal and state
law. Local cominunities will be
permitted to act on county issues
without first appealing to the State
General Assembly.

The charter proposes a restruc-
turing of the county government. It
would abolish the county commis-
sioner form of government and
replace it with a system of checks
and balances.

The county would be divided into
seven districts by the Court of
Common Pleas. A representative
is to be elected from each district to

serve on the. Board of County’

Representatives. As the legislative
branch of county government, they
are charged with adopting the
budget, levying taxes, and passing
ordinances.

Meetings of the Board are open
to the public, except when
discussing collective bargaining
items and matters pertaining to
individually named employees,
when executive sessions may be
called.

The Charter provides“ for the

'election of a County Executive to

“function as the chief executive
and administrative officer of the
county." This includes preparing
the budget and executing the
ordinances passed by the repre-
sentatives. Also, the County
Executive would appoint all de-
partment heads with the advice and
consent of the representatives.

Charter Debate Arises

Over Sex, Race Clause

BY DENISE GOWER

A clause in the Allegheny County
Home Rule Charter stating “There
shall not be a majority of more than
one of either sex on any board,”
has gained the support of women's
groups as well as individual
citizens. The provisions insures
women an equal voice in Allegheny
County government.

Allegheny County Government
Study Commission Chairman Jo-
seph James said he doesn't view
the provision as a quota system. “I
see it as equal participation. We're
no mandatin a ﬁxed number. How
else do you bring about equal
participation in government? The
political establishment has done
little or nothing to bring about
equal participation." He feels
there are enough qualiﬁed women
to fill board positions.

The need for this provision can
be seen by two factorsiaccording to
James. -“Women in responsible
positions in county government
were practically non-existent. Very
few women were represented on
advisory boards.”

James sees little possibility of
this clause affecting the approval of
the charter. However, if it is
passed he said, “Any clause in the
charter is subject to judicial
dispute.” According to a sever-
ability clause of the charter, any
part may be taken out if found

invalid by the courts without
affecting the total charter.

“Someone will challenge it,”
said Women's Political Caucus/Al-
legheny County (WPCAC) Co-
chairperson Pat Roberts.
sure it will go to the Supreme
Court.” Roberts and WPCAC Co-
chairperson Marge McGregor sug-
gested the equal participation
clause,.which was fought for within
the Commission by Jo Ann Evans
Gardner. J

Roberts feels the provision is if
‘ important because it

increases
citizen input into the govenment.
Pointing out that the clause also
states there must be at least on
black on each board she said, “It
broadens the participation of the
people in Allegheny County. If the
board doesn’t represent the
people, there isn’t representative
government. ’ '
The -provision, she said, could
help to increase women's actual

political participation. “It’s up ‘to ‘
women now. It opens the door.”‘

Cynthia Vanda, a representative
of the University Women's Center,
said, “The equal participation
clause will provide women with an
equal chance for representation.

Quota systems keep people out,

she said. “This is not a quota
system. It's a provision to get
women in."

  For the People

The Home Rule Charter proposed by the County Government Study
Commission would revitalize and streamline county government
malcing it more responsive to the needs of county residents if adopted
by the voters at the polls. in Tuesday’s primary election.

After being elected in November 1972 by the voters of the county,
the study commission has been working on the home rule charter for
the last sixteen‘ months. Though home rule will not make Allegheny ‘

— County completely independent of the federal or state governments,

voters have the opportunity to approve a restructuring of county

government.

anddepartmentswillbecutfmm36to.l9andthen1nnberofrow

ofﬁceswillbereducefroml1to4./ A _ .
In addition to streamlining county government, the charter will

.4 institute the checks and balances system in the county. At present the

county commissioners are both the executives and the legislators. The
charter divides those responsibilities between the two branches-the

1 County Executive and the Board of Representatives. In this way the

heritage of a representative democracy can be extended to the county
government.
Furthermore, by electing representatives from separate districts,

' citizens of Allegheny County will have a direct line to the. county

government. Government could be more responsive to the individual
needs of county residents. In this way elected ofﬁcials could be held
accountable to their constituents, which is the earmark of a democratic
system.

By streamlining and restructuring cormty government, government _,
can be more effective than the current commissioner system which was
created before the Revolutionary War and before expansion projects

operations of the county.

Unfortunately, though, a provision calling for race and sex quotas on
appointed boards is included in the charter. We must agree with
Robert Pierce, a study commission member, that the provision is

N “illegal, illogical and immoral.’ ’ But, critics of the charter who call for

its rejection merely because of this are overreacting to it (the
provision), and inﬂating its importance in order to retain the present
system of county government and political power.

A If the charter is rejected because of this provision, Allegheny County
citizens will be denied the opportunity to be governed by ofﬁcials
directly responsible to the voters.

Qitics of the Charter nnintain this provision will be declared

v unconstitutional. Provisions in the Orarter can be amended, however,

With the adoption of the charter county government will no longer

It is for these reasons we recommend to the voters of the county that

Battling Press Freedom

BY TOM SMITH

Duquesne University and Alle-
gheny College have been the sites
of bitter battles focusing on the
subject of freedom of the press. At
Duquesne the conflict is between
The Duquesne Duke, the campus
newspaper, and the University
administration. _

The Pitt News has been free of
any attempt on_the part rof the
administration to dictate the policy
or management of the paper.
Apparently Pitt is fortunate in that
administrators understand the im-
portance and necessity of a free
campus press.

At Allegheny College the consti-
tution of the Campus, the student
newspaper, was rejected by the
student government, which denied
recognition of the paper, threaten-
ing its existence.

The issue is control of the press.
Student governments have a
tendency to think they can control
campus newspapers without any
consideration of First Amendment
rights guaranteed by the Constitu-
tion. ‘

The University of Pittsburgh has
notbeen immune to such opinions
and conﬂicts in the past.

At this time last year many
campus publications recognized
and funded through ‘Student
Government thought their -rights
were being violated, because SG
representatives questioned and in
some cases made sweeping chan-
ges in the budgets of some campus
publications.

Harsh words were exchanged,
tempers flared, and overblown and
distorted arguments created non-
sensical misunderstandings and
mental blocs between media
representatives and members of
Student Government.

‘ newsletters.

The controversy did not include
the Pitt News, since it was
budgeted for a two year period,
which expires June 30. »

Most media representatives did
not realize the members of the SG
Allocations Committee have the
right to ask any questions they
deem necessary during budget
interviews. However, the right to
question cannot be equated with
the authority to recommend. The
power of 5G, is limited when the
free press issue is involved.

However, a distinction should be
made between the campus press
and special interest magazines or
Their goals and
functions differ completely from
those of a publication such as a
campus newspaper, which strives

' to inform and to provoke in the

interests of the general campus
community.

The battle resumed last fall when
the Allocations Committee drafted
an inadequately written proposal
declaring Student Government the

[publisher of all campus publica-

tions. The motives behind the

-proposal were not sinister and the

proposal was not directed at the
publications solely, but also the
administrative functions of the
Allocations Committe itself. The
effect of such a proposal, however,
if enacted, would have been

"devastating to the fundamental

rights of a free campus press.
The‘ proposal, spawned by a
misunderstanding of the role of the
campus press and an ignorance of
the sensitivity of the free press
issue among campus journalists,
was withdrawn by the committee.
To avoid such confrontations this

year, the SGB voted to reorganize
the Student Publications Board.

The committee (composed of

1/’

administration representatives,
media professionals, faculty, and
students is to review the budgets of
student publications and make re
Commendations to Student Gov-
ernment.

In this way SG could be certain
the funds invested in campus
publications are not wasted, and at
the same time do not infringe upon
the rights and responsibilities of
the free press.

Whether this goal will be
achieved is unknown, since the
budgets are being reviewed at this
time. , ‘ '

The issue of the free press is
paramount in these proceedings. It
cannot be forgotten and must
remain one of the central concerns
of those involved in the decision-
making processes.

Any attempt to inhibit the
functioning of a college newspaper
as determined by those responsible
for the daily operations for the
paper, the editorial and business
staffs, is an infringment of First
Amendment rights, which cannot
be tolerated by either the news-
paper or the University community.

The free press is the crux of the
American democratic system. The
issue exceeds the realm of student

. government committees or univer-

sity boards.

1*‘

...J



It was this issue which SG failed .

to comprehend last year. President
Mike Furick has indicated in the
past the need for a newspaper free
of the political hagglings of student
governments.

Hopefully,_ this attitude still
prevails and characterizes all those
involved in Pitt's Student Govern-
merit. The Furick administration,
perhaps, ‘will learn from the
mistakes of the past.

 I 6 Offensive Against Watergate i

“plumbers,” and other federal’

agencies use wiretaps, burglary,
surveillance, mail tampering, sab-
otage and even terrorism to try to

stop‘ opposition to government‘

policy.

Antiwar groups, socialists, black
organizations, labor unions, wo-
men’s groups and others challeng-
ing the government have been the
main victims of such “Watergat-
ing.” They have been spied on,
inﬁltrated, harassed and otherwise
attacked for exercising their right
to protest, all under the pretext of
national security. ‘ ‘

In a major breakthrough for. the
suit, the US government has
admitted conducting a broad spy
operation against the SWP dating
back to 1945 and more recently
against the YSA. The US attorney
claims this harassment is justified
because the SWP and YSA are
“subversive." '

FBI memorandums released
' '-‘ ‘*-‘N-' ‘   .-

recently’ showed the same tactics

were used against’ the. Black -

Panther Party and other black
nationalist groups. These memos
call on the FBI “to "expose, disrupt
and otherwise neutralize” the
groups and individuals named.
These documents contain the

' strongest evidence yet seen from .

official sources of likely govern-
ment compliance in the murders of

Malcolm X and‘ Martin‘ Luther"

King. ‘

The contents of these documents
further indicate the need for groups
and individuals to support this
important offensive against Water-
gate. .

PRDF has gained much national
support. It has received endorse-
ments and support from Daniel

Ellsberg, Daniel and Phillip Berri-
gan and Gloria Steinem as well as
others. '

The PRDF has had much success
in gaining local support from union

S Struggle

Editor:

The month of May has been

designated as Afrikan Liberation
Month. It is the time when
Afrikans from all over the diaspora
rise in support of the Afrikan
Liberation Struggles being waged
in Angola, Mozambique, South-
west and Southern Afrika.
. Two years ago in May of 1974
mass demonstrations were held in
Toronto, Canada, San Francisco,
Washington D.C. and in the
Caribbean. The year after that saw
local demonstrations in major cities
throughout North America. On
May 25, 1974 there will be another
major demonstration in the same
cities as the ’72 demonstrations.

The Afrikan Liberation Support
Committee, which was founded by
Pan Afrikan activist Owusu Sad-

. aukai (Howard Fuller), declared an

Afrikan Liberation Day in 1972.
This year the Afrikan Liberation
Support Committee has declared
May as Afrikan Liberation Month.

’ A full month of activities is planned

in various parts of the country
including the Afrikan Liberation

. Fund-Raising Drive.

The most significant activities for
the month will be a two day
conference on racism and imperial-
ism in Washington, D. C., May 23
and 24; Afrikan Liberation Fund-
Raising Drive, the goal of which is

tion set for May 25 in Washington,
D;C. \

On the ‘local level Afrikan
Liberation Month activities will
include an Afrikan Women’s
Seminar on May 18 at Ozanam
Cultural Center, 1833 Wylie
Avenue from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM,
and Malcolm X Kuzaliwa Celebra-
tion with the annual Unity Day
Parade, Sunday, May 19.
Marching bands and groups are
urged to submit their names’ to
participate in the parade.

Everyone is urged to support
Afrikan Liberation Month in any
and every way that they can. And,
especially contribute to the Fund-
Raising Campaign.

A Health

Dear Editor:

The United States is the world’s
wealthiest nation, butit is the only
major industrial power which does
not have national health insurance.
This may be the reason why each
year morelinfants die in America
than in 14 other countries. It may
also account for the fact that
American men aged,45 can expect
to live fewer years than males in 27
foreign nations, and American
women of the same age wilklive
shorter lives than females in 11‘
other countries.

 

Today, the average American

worker labors one full month out of

every year just to pay health care
and health insurance bills. Even
more tragic is the fact that 40
million Americans
inadequate coverage‘ or no health

insurance of any kind, and many’

efderly citizens pay more for
medical services under_ Medicare
than before that program began.
In the name of free enterprise,
our hopelessly fragmented health
insurance and health care delivery
system permits most doctors and
insurance companies to make large
pr\ofits while it shortchanges
persons who cannot afford to pay.
-In fact, over 5000 American
communities, mostly rural- and
urban poor, have no doctor at all.
Unfortunately, none of the health
insurance bills now under consi-
deration by Congress" provides
sufficient coverage. What is
necessary instead is comprehen-
sive national health insurance
which will provide complete cover-
age for all of those essentail health
insurance which will provide
complete coverage for allof those
essential health sevices needed by
every American, regardless of age,
occupation, or ability to pay. Of
course, the cost of this insurance
will be substantial; however, it will
be far less than the 100 billion
dollars which Americans spend
every year in the form of insurance
premiums and out-of-pocket med-

have either .

ical expenses. ,
Whatever form of national health
insurance is adopted, it should
provide for publick participation
and control at the local, as well as
at the state and national levels.
Americans can no longer afford to
allow their right to adequate health
care to remain dependent upon

whether or ‘not doctors and.

insurance companies are able to
sell it on a financially proﬁtable
basis. —

The Fully Automated Love Life of ‘

Anthology, Various Authors _
Playboy Press Science Fiction, BK
16135, °
Paperback, 75 cents

It looks as though summer weather 4

is once again upon us. and as a
result thousands of astute readers
have been forced to abandon their
fireside chairs in favor of making

- whoopie on the beaches of distant

shores._
As countless outdoor leisure time

distractions make if impossible to.

sit down and complete a 500 page
novel, this is the time of year that
reading an anthology of good short
stories niakes a lot of “sense.

In an effort to capitalize on our
summertime thirst for “Quickie”
fiction, Playboy Press has re-re-
leased its highly successful series
of paperbacks under the title of The
Playboy Science Fiction Series.

While all
excellent, The Full; Automated
Love Life of Henry Keanridge is
undoubtably the highlight of this or
any other science fiction series.

Wait a minute, folks.

before you turn the, page or go
frantically searching_for a cross-
word puzzle - hear me out. This

isn‘t just another 3rd rate- science

fiction anthology.

superb satire of those children-of-I

first-rate science fiction satires
from some of the most respected
authors in the field (notably Ray
Bradbury and Ron Goulart). All
very short (3-10 pages), the stories
range from the absurd “Number
Eight“ to political satire “The
Trouble With Machines" to social
comment “The Fully Automated
Love Life...”

All of the stories are actual
reprints of short fiction that has
appeared in Playboy magazines
between the years 1960-1972.
Playboy has always been recog-
nized as a source of first rate sci-fi,
but these selected stories are
particularly delightful.

The Trouble With Machines (by
Ron Goulart) concerns itselfiwith a
very inﬂuential consumer crusader
(shades of Ralph Nader) who is
constantly infuriating the heads of
a large corporate empire (shades of
ITT). ‘So. the masterminds of the
corporation get together and
design a robot to hide in this
Nader-type f'ellow's laboratory and
bump him off when the time is
right. A

Well, the vicious robot turns out
to look like alittle blue refrigerator
with springy arms that areijust

perfect for sneaking up behind‘

someone and strangling the day-
out of him. The whole
murder scene is a casual calamity

that shouldn‘t be missed by anyone

who likes a good belly laugh.
An_other highlight of this de-
lightful anthology ‘ is. a simply

the-fifties, the low budget black-
and-white science fiction flicks
about malevolent artichokes from
out space.

concerns itself with a strange

creature from outer space that

leaves it victims with acute nausea,
their bodies covered with unearthy-
type gobs of goo.

Lo and behold, the monster turns
out to be a 50-foot blob of hairy
Vaseline who is only searching for
love. Of course he ﬁnds it in the
person of a ‘voluptuous starlet
named ‘Brenda Bradstone, who
uses Vaseline under her eye-make-

The insanity "of. the plot is
delightful. including a big fight
scene between the monster and the
good guys. the US'infantry, the
Polish cavalry, and the Air Force of

The final love '-scene is a
heartbreaker as the beautiful

starlet and the humming (blob of '

Vaseiine zoom off into outer space
while Brenda sighs, ‘.‘I’ve always

been a sucker for tall, hairy guys.”

Like Brenda Bradstoiie, this book
will undoubtably give a lift to
anyone suffering from the sum-
mertime blues.

charter will save taxpayers an
estimated $1 million or more
because of the consolidation of
various departments and agencies
and elimination of job duplication.

The number of county depart-
ments and bureaus will be reduced

I from 36 to 19 and the number of

row offices will be cut from 11 to 4.
The charter eliminates the three
county commissioners, whose du-
ties will be performed by the Board
of Representatives and the County
Executive. The functions of the
Clerk of'Courts, the Prothonotary,
and the Register of Wills‘ will be
condensed into ' one, office, the
County Registrar. T -
All offices” except the Board of
Representatives will be elected at
large. ‘
M In lieu of an elected coroner, a
medical examiner would be ap-
pointed. The departments of the
Treasurer, the Recorder of Deeds,
and the Jury Commissioners will be
abolished and the County Execu-
tive will assume those functions.
Proponents of the charter con-
tend its greatest asset ‘is the
creation of a system of checks and
balances. Chairman of the County
Government Study Commission
Joseph A. -James contends the

Vi county lacks this “most important

traditional safeguard of American
government...The charter elim-
inates the present county commis-
sioner system--wliere the same
people serve as executives, ‘ad-
ministrators, and legislators.”
Opponents of the charter include
the three county commissioners,

result in a tax increase because the

cost of county government will

9

increase by the /,“millions.’

James counter, though, by
sayding, “Our greatest protection
against future tax increases is a
government designed to provide a
critical review of county spend-
ing." The county budget prepared
by the executive and reviewed by
-the representatives at public
hearings according to James
should result in “less waste and
padding, and more public and
critical review of how our county
tax dollars are spent.”

The, commissioners also reject
the concept of district elected
representatives saying it would

result in “less effective govern-

ment." The commissioners state,
“We cannot. condone the dilution of
' voting ‘power that this charter wil_l
enforce...The voter will be unable
to vote for or against six of the

  

seven representatives."

The Study Commission argues
the purpose of home rule is to make
government directly responsible to
the people, so “the concern of the
citizens and the priorities of the
different areas’ of the county can be
presented, deliberated, _and acted
upon.”

Republican Commissioner Dr.
William Hunt-"has expressed
disapproval of the charter because
it does not guarantee minority
party representation. He contends
it is through minority party
representation that ‘-‘the historical
system of checks and balances” is
preserved.

Instead, the county commis-
sioners propose the creation of a
government consisting of the
county commissioners . elected at
large and an appointed county
executive.

The issue,,though, according to
James is not the “red herrings”

 Home Rule Charter FdcesiTues. Referen um

‘objected to by the comgmissioners,

but rather the question of home
rule itself. “With home rule,"
says James, “locally elected
officials will ‘make our local
decisions. I

“We can hold these officials
directly responsible for what they
do, or what they do not do. Our
county officials won’t be able to
pass the buck to Harrisburg any
longer.”

A controversial section of the
charter is the provision.calling for
race and sex guidelines for board
appointments. »The provision
reads, “Thereishall not be a
majority of more than one of either
sex on any board. There shall be at
least one member of the black race
on each board."

.-The provision passed by a
narrow 4 to 3 vote of the Study .
Commission. Robert N. Pierce,
Jr.. a‘imember of the. study
commission,-’ termed the provision ,

A SGB member Bruce Keeler in-
gtroduced the motion after a
-lengthy discussion on sex discrim-
"ination in previous Homecoming
"elections. “It isn’t fair to have
only girls run for Homecoming
"Queen,” Keeler said, “people just
way.”
 The four SGB members pres-
ent at the meet agreed that fund-
‘jing a committee discriminating on
"the basis of sex was against the
Committee on Student Organiza-
ftions (CSO) by-laws. The vote to

male nominees passed two to one .
with one vote abstaining.

The 1974 Homecoming activites
budget was cut from $26,597.50 to
$18,987.50. The rationale for the
Allocations Committee’s cut in
funds was largely upheld-by the
SGB. but several items were sent
back by the board to be resub-
mitted to the Allocations Com-
mittee.

When the Homecoming Com-
mittee‘was denied funds for hold-
ing its dance in the Syria Mosque
basement, Homecoming ’.74 Chair-
person Janet Toth said, “If we

 

can’t have the Mosque, then the
committee will not hold the

dance.” I
The oftlcampus Mosque was

was chosen by the committee be-
cause of the University’s policy
against serving alcoholic bever.‘-
ages to students on campus.

After the SGB ended discusson
on the Homecoming ‘budget. Toth

delivered a formal statement:

“I will take these rationales
back to the Homecoming Commit-

tee. If the committees does not re-

ceive what it believes to be ade-
quate funding to pull off a great

1974 Homecoming, then, and I-

have their full support, I will re-

 

sign and most of the committee
will resign.”

A motion against remuneration
of SGB members was passed
three to one by the Board. SGB
member Bruce Keeler. who ini-
tiated the motion. said. ‘‘There’s
no legitimate reason for it (re-
muneration). People are going to
have to be in Student Govern-
ment because they care.”

Keeler’s motion also proposed
setting up independent-study
credits of varying amounts for
students who participate in Uni-
versity organizations and are un-
able to hold paying jobs.

omecoming King A Po

Though SGB members aren’t
receiving remuneration at the
present time, this motion stands
as the board’s statement against
future remuneration proposals.
The board can override this mo-
tion, however, at a future meet-
ing.

The SGB defeated a proposal
to give office space to the Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate News
Service (PINS). PINS represen-
tative Karen Burgio told the SGB
that the free news service would
link Pitt with other major col-
leges in Pennsylvania such as

Having radically altered the
traditions of tennis already, the
Pittsburgh Triangles and the other
members of the World = Team
Tennis League realize they’re
going to have to make more
changes if the infant league is to
succeed.

The owners ﬁgured it would take
2 1/2 hours to play the six sets
mens’ singles, women’s singles,
and mixed doubles, two sets each,
including a 15-minute intermission.

They _felt 2 1/2 hours was the
perfect time for a sporting event,
the exact time of an average hockey
or baseball game.

Their prediction was way off.

The Triangles’ opening home‘

match May 7 started 20 minutes
late, and ended three hours later.
The spectators sat there for 3 1/2
hours, and their ‘restlessness
showed.

The situation repeated itself’

throughout the league, and after a
series of phone calls, the teams
decided to try to cut out as much

time as possible, without altering
the format. '

The results showed at the
Triangles second home match, but
it still wasn’t enough. After
starting on time, cutting the
halftime to five minutes, and
enforcing the players’ warmup
limitations, the match still ran
three hours.

The league owners _now realize
they’re going to have to make a
drastic change in Team Tennis.
They'll probably decide at a
meeting in Chicago tomorrow.

One proposal is to add mens’ and
womens’ doubles, playing one of
each set instead of the present two,
and thus a total of ﬁve instead of
the present six. Another idea is to
cut the number of games in a set to
ﬁve. The ﬁrst proposal has been
appfoved by more than half the
owners. _

Triangle player ‘Vitas Gerulaitis
doesn’t like either one-

“Men’s doubles would be
interesting,” he said, “but not

women’s. I’m biased, but the only
time I'd enjoy watching women’s
doubles is if the top-ranked women
played-, and they’re all playing
singles.

“The ﬁve game-set idea isn’t
any good either. One of the great
things about tennis is that you can
fall behind "and still catch a guy.

’It’ll be really tough to do that in

ﬁve games.”

Gerulaitas does ‘concede -that
something has to be done. The
owners are not unwilling to make a

and that’s good.

F lyers A Game A7/ivay...

PHILADELPHIA AP - Experience

has taught Philadelphia Flyers,

Coach Fred Shero not to count on
anything. ' ,

Shero’s team has a 3-1 lead today
over the Boston Bruins in the
National Hockey League Stanley
Cup ﬁnal playoff. He has the home
ice edge. He should be dusting off
a spot for the storied Cup. .

But he isn't. ,

After the Flyers beat the Bruins
Tuesday night 4-2, with Bill Barber

~ slapping in a 40-foot goal at 14:25

of the final period for the winning
score, Shero commented: “I’ve
been there before. Don’t count on
the Cup yet.” ‘

Shero explained that in the 1950

Stanley Cup ﬁnal he was a member
of the "New York Rangers’ team
that had a 3-1 lead on Detroit, and
.' twice had two-goal leads in the last
two games, but lost. \Shero’s
history is a little hazy. The Stanley
Cup record book shows that New
York led. 3-2, not 3-1, but the
analogy is close. As a matter of
fact, only one team in NHL history
has ever come from a 3-1 or 3-0
deﬁcit to win the Cup-the Toronto
Maple Leafs in 1942 over the
Detroit Red Wings. _
The Flyers left nothing to chance
as they battled to gain a
stranglehold on the mighty Bruins.
Before the game, instead of the
national anthem, they played the

  Cougars Assume

New Strategy

CHICAGO AP - The Chicago
Cougars, faced with a “must”
game against the Houston Aeros
Wednesday night in their World
Hockey Association championship
playoff, will have to depend on
ﬁnesse rather than muscle.

“They carry their sticks high,”
said Cougar player-coach Pat
Stapleton, “but we can’t outmuscle
them. That's what Minnesota tried
to do in their series and it didn’t
work. The only way we can beat
this club is to outskate them.”

The cougars tried muscle Sunday
night in the ﬁrst period of the
opener of the best-of-seven series.
But they fell behind ‘2-0. The
Cougars went back toiskating, and
tied the game at 2-2 before Frank
Hughes scored with 4:12 left to
give the Aeros a 3-2 victory. -

What makes Wednesday night’s
game a “must”. so early in the
series is that play switches ‘to
Houston for the next three games
and the Cougars haven’t won there

,. _ pl.ayoffs.."._.Din.een said.

The series should have opened in
Houston since the Aeros ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the Western Division while
the Cougars’were fourth in the
East. '

But the same‘ Peter Pan
production that forced the Cougars
to leave the International Amphi-

theatre for the suburban Randhurst -

Twin Ice Arena knocked the Aeros
from their home ice this week.

Houston Coach Bill Dineen said,
“No club in this league can
intimidate us. At least on one has
in two years. Minnesota tried but it
only hurt them. We can take care
of ourselves.”

With Cam ' Newton. suffering

‘from a strep throat, the Cougars

probably will continue with Andre
Gill.

There’s no question who will be
in the nets for the Aeros. It will be
Don McLeod, who has worked

every minute of the playoffs and’

has a 9-1 record.

Philadelphia has won nine out of

The goal by the 21-year-old

  Triangles Need More Changes

BY RON SIEGEL

Picked to win the league
championship, the Triangles are off
to a very shaky/start, having lost
three of their ﬁrst ﬁve matches.
Bad breaks have been pursuing
them everywhere, with unknown
players playing superbly against
them. ,

The Philadelphia Freedoms, led
by their player-coach- Billie Jean
King, dealt the Tri’s two defeats to
start the season. King had her
team running and conditioning, not

-to mention practicing, for three

weeks before the opening match,
while some of the Triangles never
met until the ﬁrst set.

The Freedoms routed Pittsburgh
twice, and became the favorites in
the East division.

The Tri’s followed that up with
two wins on the road, over New
York and Florida, but lost their
second home game last Sunday to
Hawaii.

Ali Promises
“New Punch”

By WILL GRIMSLEY
AP Special Correspondent
NEW YORK AP - Muham- mad
Ali promised to unveil a new
punch-the “ghetto whopper”-to

win back the world heavyweight’

boxing championship from George
Foreman in their projected $30
million Fight of the Ages next
September in remote, mysterious
Zaire.

The time was formally set
Wednesday as 3 a.m., Sept. 25,

Penguins’
A ianchin
Injured

PITTSBURGH AP - Leftwinger .

Wayne Bianchin has broken his
neck in a surﬁng accident, the
Pittsburgh Penquins report, but he
should be well enough to play
hockey again in September barring
complications. -

The National Hockey League
club said the 20-year-old Bianchin
was injured as he was body surﬁng
in Hawaii last week.

A spokesman said Tuesday that
Bianchin would be transferred to a
Pittsburgh hospital later this week.

Bianchin was a rookie last year

and started the season with *the_

Penquins’ Hersheyxfarm club. He
played in 69 games for the
Penguins and scored 12 goals and

ropes.

Zaire time, or 10 p.m., EDT, Sept.
24, when it will be beamed to what
promoters say will be a record 400
outlets and 2.75 million viewers in
the United States and Canada
alone.

Each ﬁghter has been guaran-

teed $5 million, biggest payoff in_:

ring history.

Ali, who showed up at a pre-noon
news conference to M give a
35-minute spiel of bombast and
poetry, was asked how he would
feel going into the ring three hours
after midnight.

“I got me a new punch," he
explained. “I borrowed it from my
old friend, Kid Gavilan, who will be
working out with me. He called it
the ‘bolo punch.’ I renamed it the
‘ghetto whopper.’

“At 3 a.m. is the time the bars
are all letting out in the ghettos.
That's when the brothers start
arguing about their women and
who shot the dice last. That's when
they start throwing them ghetto
punches."

Ali called Gavilan to the center of
the stage to demonstrate the
looping uppercut. I

The 32-year-old Ali chided
Foreman for failing to appear.
Officials said the champion’s
absence was due to a mixup in
communications.

“I will win and bring punctuality
the former
champion said. “Foreman plays a
cat and mouse game like a little
child. We will have no more
duckin’ and dodgin’. , That. kills
boxing.”

Ali called Foreman a “dirty”
ﬁghter, insisting the champ belted
Joe Frazier illegally, hit King
Roman when he was down and
twice hit Ken Norton when the
latter’ was helpless against the

Cannonade   Favored...

BALTIMORE AP - Kentucky
Derby winner Cannonade is raring
to go in Saturday's Preakness,
trainer Woody Stephens said
Wednesday.

The John M. Olin-owned colt
was kicking and romping following
a morning gallop.

. “He is always full of life,"
Stephens said. “He loves to play
and eat. I'll blow him out a
half-mile Thursday and that will be
it.“ .

Cannonade also will be entered
Thursday for the $150,000-added, 1
3-16 mile Preakness at Pimlico in
which he is expected to be opposed
by a dozen 3-year-olds, including

Pocono  
Bankrupt

WILKES-BARRE* Pa. AP - All
horses now stabled at the Pocono
Downs racetrack must be moved
before 6 p.m. Friday, May 24,
under order of the Pocono Downs
Inc. management.

Track president Aldo Franconi
said the action to clear the track of
some 100 horses was taken to avoid
misleading owners that there might
be a meet. .

The Pennsylvania Harness Rac-
ing Commission voted unanimously
last weekend to deny racing dates
to the Pocono Racing Management
Association, due mainly to the
PRMA’s financial difficulties.

State Rep. Bernard O'Brien,
D-Luzerne, said he would question
the commissioners on their deci-
sion. He said the loss of harness
racing would cause substantial
unemployment and income loss in
the area and would result in a loss
of about $1.5 million in state
revenue.

five of the first six who followed
him across the finish in the Derby

Scheduled to test Cannonade
again were Robert B. Cohen's
Hudson County. Derby runner-up,
and W. C. Partee's J.R.'s Pet,
John Galbreath's Little Current,
Kenneth Opstein's Destroyer and
John Connelly's Buck's Bid. They
ﬁnished fourth through seventh,
respectively,.in the 1 1/4-mile
