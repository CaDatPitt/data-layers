To Coast For New Year’s Classic

We’re In!

Last night at approximately 10 o'clock, E. S. T., the official
invitation for the University of Pittsburgh to meet the Wash-
ington Huskies in the Rose Bowl classic was announced at the
conclusion of the annual Varsity Letter Club banquet by W. Don

Harrison, director of athletics.

For the past few weeks the entire nation has been flooded with rumors
concerning the selection of the Eastern opponent to meet the West Coast
champions in the famed Pasiadena stadium on New Year's Day.

The bid came dramatically by way

of Associated Press just as adjourn-
ment of the banquet was being con-
sidered.
‘ This is the fourth time, breaking
§Rose Bowl precedent, that the Pitt
Panthers have been selected to repre-
sent the East in the New Year's Day
classic.

Looking at the records of the two
fteams it is signiﬁcant that both have
glost one game and tied one.

Coach Phelan’s Washington eleven
dropped its ﬁrst contest to Minne-
sota, but then went on to win every
game with the exception of a 14-14
tie with the Stanford Indians.

Pitt lost to Duquesne, 7-0, and was
tied by Fordham, 0-0.

Squad Votes Acceptance

Director of Rose Bowl Publicity
Guy Rosenthal, in conjunction with
Ray Eckmann, athletic director of the
, University of Washington, announced
ithe decision of the Washington ath-
letic department. The chosen coast
school was extended the privilege of
selecting its opponent for this 22nd
game in the Rose Bowl series.

Coach Sutherland put the question
to a vote of the squad following
Charles D. Wettach’s (chairman of
the Athletic Council) annual dinner,
Monday. The squad at that time
voted unanimously to accept a bid
to the Rose Bowl, providing that bid
was forthcoming.

Dr. Sutherland’s statement, “We’ve
been out there before," in comment-
ing on the invitation, was concluded
with: “We’re going to play just like
you boys feel like playing now.”

With the exception of a few
remaining late season grid
clashes and the three Bowl af-
fairs, the pigskin parade has
drawn its curtain on the 1936
campaign. The prognosticators
are already lining up illusions for
next fall, and the lads and lassies of
Pittsburgh see a silver lining on the
football horizon for their Blue and
Gold eleven next year.

But, lest we forget, a few bou-
quets have to be handed out for
the notable accomplishments of
this year's Panther football ma-
chine.

The plaudits dished out by East-
ern football experts and mid-West-
ern writers for the lavish praise ac-
corded the sc-hools in their sections
have always seemed grossly unfair.
You go East and hear Dartmouth.
Fordham, Yale, Princeton, Columbia

and others raised to the high heavens. '

You go West and listen to loud
praises for the Big Ten schools,
Notre Dame, Marquette, Nebraska and
others. It seems that the mountains
leave Pitt and the other city schools
“played in the middle,” so to put 1t
mildly.

Kappa Sigs, Theta Chis, PiKA’s,

I

When the smoke cleared Kappa
Sigs had defeated Theta Chi, taking
two games in succession to win the
match, 15-10 and 15-2. The Delts,
defending champs, won by virtue of
a forfeit over the Phi Eps. In the
ﬁnal game of the evening Lambda
Chi took the two best out of three
from PiKA, 15-8, 2-15 and 15-6.

The Delts because of their forfeit
had no opportunity to show their
hand but the current champs can be
counted on to put up some hard
battles in defending their crown.
Kappa Sigma, fresh from the touch
football wars, has developed win-
ning ways and continued to dominate
interfrat competition as they soundly
thrashed Theta Chi into submission.
Theta Chi and its early threats and
long volleys had the Kappa Sigs wor-
ried at the outset, but as the tide of
battle progressed the victors slowly
‘gathered steam and held their fra-
ternity row brothers to a pair of tal-

floor last Monday evening. ~

December 2, with grand ﬁnale Wed-

With the Interfrat tourney enter-
ing the second round, Mr. Feely is
busy making plans for an engineer-
mg and an independent league. He
requests that all teams wishing to en-
ter these tourneys contact him at the
Trees Gym. Further scheduling of
these volleyball tourneys is impossi-
ble until several more teams are en-
tered. No engineering groups were
entered in touch football tourneys
and Feely desires to foster this de-
partment in a volleyball league.

Varsity Swim Team
Beats Canton Y, 43-21

It was real practice Wednesday
evening when the Panther natators
took over the Canton Y mermen
43-21 in a pre-season meet held in
the home pool at Trees Gym. It
was almost an all-Panther affair
with Pat Corr’s men coming
through to take every event except
the 400-yard relay.

The local boys started it off by
winning the 300-yard medley relay.
Milt Ledersteine captured the 220-
yard freestyle, Nowotny took the
40 and 100-yard freestyles, Locke
annexed the 440-yard freestyle,
Slobodian won the backstroke,
Beacon ﬁrsted in the breaststroke,
and Brown took the diving event
with McQuillan holding second
place. The Panthers dropped the
400-yard relay although they held
the lead most of the way.

After the meet Coach Corr said
that he was well pleased with the
work of the boys and especially
with the form shown by the fresh-
men. »

We’ll admit that the Fordham line
was good, but nevertheless it sur-
prises us that some enterprising pub-
licity man didn’t caption our Pitt
line, “The Seven Scotchmen,” be-
cause they certainly were tight when
it came to giving yardage to opposing
teams. (Ohio State papers, please
copy.)

We can’t forget that Duquesne
debacle, but we'll give plenty of
credit to the Dukes. They did
what eight other teams couldn’t do.
However, it's the eight other teams
we wish to consider. No team in
recent years has done what Pitt
did to Ohio State. With the em-
phasis on offensive tactics in the
game today, Ohio State ﬁnished up
with plus six yards, and the Buck-
eyes are still wondering how the

It took Notre Dame about 53 min-

never had the ball inside Pitt’s thirty-
yard line, Nebraska needed a long
forward pass to score its lone touch
down, Penn State pulled an antique
out of its bag to score on a “sleeper
play.” That leaves Tech and Du-
quesne to be considered.

Tech and Duquesne, both, used
running plays to make scores, the

At [Mount Mercy

 

Ten University women will partici-
pate tomorrow in a swimming meet
which will be sponsored by the Mt.
Mercy College for Women. This is
the ﬁrst of a series of intercollegiate
playdays planned by the city schools
for this year. Other participants will
be from Pennsylvania College for
Women and Duquesne University.

Included in the meet, which will
take place from 1 to 6 o’clock to-
morrow afternoon, are swimming re-
lays and backstroke, crawl and breast-
stroke demonstrations.

As a result of a suggestion made
last spring by WAA, all the colleges
of Pittsburgh planned a series f ro-
tating sports days by each school
playing hostess for a play day at
the end of each sports season. Re-
cently, Carnegie Tech has had to drop
out, leaving PCW, Duquesne, Mt.
Mercy and the University as the in-
tercollegiate playday sponsors.

This Man Gentry

T ONIGHT the freshmen step out

socially. Many of them, we agree,
are already off to a great start; but
there are others who need the stimu-
lus such as tonight's dance may pro-
vide. To meet people, ﬁrst. 31¢”
gradually learn to know them well is
essential in any University. Perhaps
such events do not accomplish a great
deal other than providing relaxation
from things we call daily drudgery.
a touch of glamour, perhaps, or
pretty chatter.

For some years now, it has been a
virtual tradition in these parts for na-
tional bands to substitute local talent
for their one-night stands as guests of
honor and a few dollars at University
events. Perhaps we really don’t pay
them enough. At any rate Seniors, at
least, can recall famous instances,
when gentlemen like Ferde Grofc
never even got out of the Grand
Canyon with their suites and knick-
knacks for easy-going sophomores
two falls back. Yes, they have suf-
fered. But who cares?

Tonight, it is the honest belief that
the ambitious ﬁrst-year men will not
only break precedent in their selec-
tion of a top-notch orchestra, at
least semi-so and probably “top” in
comparison with other outﬁts which
have made appearances here, but will
again break precedent when they
place the “one, and only original, etc.

.” in short, the real Tom Gentry
on the band stand.

It has been learned, upon authority,
that Tom Gentry and his Ambassa-
dors are anxious to break into the
Pittsburgh district, particularly at a
downtown “spot.” For this reason,
his spirited personal bid for the
annual freshman event must have
more than a few dollars behind it.
His reputation is at stake, and thus,
perhaps, the University dancegoers
will be rewarded with the original,
present, and future Tom Gentry and
Company. At any rate, good luck to
the plebes for a pleasant first-nighter.
As to Mr. Gentry, we shall see.

Silverman Honored

WHEN Dr. Alexander Silverman,
head of the department of chem-
istry, was chosen to deliver the
Founder’s Day address at Alfred Uni-
versity and subsequently received an
honorary degree of Doctor of Science
yesterday, it was another instance in
which the accomplishments of a
member of the University faculty
were recognized, concretely, by an-
other University in this country.
Congratulations, Dr. Silverman!

Women’s Day, which was to have

In the past it has been customary
for this day to be celebrated on the
ﬁrst Friday of December. The pro-
grams usually feature a pageant or

Precedent

Student May Be First Male
To Enter Frick School;
Awaits Admission

 

It used to be that women fought
for equal rights with men. Now the
reverse seems to be true.

Jules Cuburnak, C40, is a male.
Frick Teachers Training School
teaches women only. At least it has
done so since its opening.

But along comes Mr. Cuburnak
with the discovery that the school’s
charter does not prohibit the entrance
of men, and that the exclusive pres-
ence of women at Frick is merely a
tradition.

Therefore, since entrance to the
school is determined by examination,
Mr. Cuburnak last year announced
his intention of applying for entrance
to the prinicpal, Dr. Dana Eckert. Dr.
Eckert interpreted the charter favor-
ably, but the enrollment was limited
and the class of 1940 had already
reached its quota.

As a result, Mr. Cuburnak has en-
rolled in courses at the University
to wait for next year. He has already
taken the required tests and inter-
views.

Mr. Cuburnak admi-ts it will be an
unusual feeling to be surrounded by
about 130 women.

Students Supervise Clubs,
Activities In Pittsburgh
Settlement Houses

By Harrioon Chandler

Nearly 50 students have begun
work as volunteers this month in set-
tlement houses and community cen-
ters throughout the city as a result
of the efforts of the University YWCA
and YMCA, it was revealed this
week.

Leadership activities in these vari-
ous centers, which number 14 in all,
include club supervision, leading
classes in sewing, dancing, music,
cooking, physical education, arts and
crafts.

The drive to interest students in
volunteer work was launched in Oc-
tober at a meeting addressed by fac-
ulty members of the School of Social
Work.

Volunteer-o Meet

The ﬁrst of a series of volunteers’
forum meetings, which will continue
throughout the school year, will be
held Friday evening, December 11, in
the club rooms, Forbes and Bouquet
Streets. The forums, designed to im-
prove the leadership qualities of work-
ers, will feature addresses by leaders
in the social work ﬁeld, followed by
discussion.

In an effort to select the most ap-
propriate forum subjects and speak-

ing sent this week to all the social
agencies at which students have been
placed. The questionnaires ask for
an appraisal of the student’s ability
in the various phases of his work.
They are to be ﬁlled out and returned
to the University as conﬁdential in-
formation.

Plan Forum Program

Thus knowing the greatest general
deﬁciencies of the volunteers, the
committee believes it will be able in-
telligently to plan the forum pro-
gram. Ruth Sharpe and Robert
Woodrutf are co-chairmen of the com-
mittee.

The Irene Kaufman Settlement
alone accounts for 15 of the students
placed. Of these, the supervision of
girls’ and boys’ clubs claims Cather-
ine Haus, Charlotte Levy, Catherine
Maloney, Irene Rabinovitz, Muriel
Rosenblum, Mary Snyder, Melvin Le-
vine, Shelton Greenberg, Jules Cuber-
nek, .Thelma Weiner, Beatrice Rice,
Charlotte Horowitz and Harriet
Wolfe. Beatrice Blumenfeld and Mil-
dred Israel are in charge of the play-
room.

Six girls are finding a wide range
of interests at the Soho Community
House. Rose Anne Boor assists in
club work, playing the piano for vari-

ous musical activities; Grace Car-
thew and Mary J. Crouse are assigned
to the game room. Doris Grennan
leads a club; Lucille Lonergan teaches
art, and Jean Punsky is employed in
the office.

Kingsley House has accepted Jane
Bell as an assistant in club work,
and Virginia Krueger, Louise Saling
and Mary J. Trowbridge as instruc-
tors in dramatics, cooking and sew-
ing, respectively.

Munhall Claims Two

At the Munhall Neighborhood
House Sally Bald is in charge of the
game room one afternoon a week- and
Maryetta MacKenzie gives piano les-
sons and plays the piano for tap danc-
ing classes.

At Brashear Settlement House
Catherine E. Hallock teaches singing
and folk dancing. George Kennedy
is a leader of young people’s group
work.

Every Saturday at the Rankin
Christian Center Margaret Likovich
is a teacher in the Week-Day School
of Religious Education. Arts and
crafts, music appreciation, and a so-
cial hour are included in the pro-
gram as well as religious training.

Art Critics Parasitic,
Comments Dr. Schoen

Speaker Calls Dogmatisms
Impertinent In Address
Before Pi Tau Phi

 

By Marian E. Price
“Critics exist as parasites on the
creative worker,” declared Dr. Max
Schoen of Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology, before Pi Tau Phi, honorary
scholastic fraternity in the College,

‘Monday night, when he spoke on

“Art, Artists, and Critics.” “Criti-
cism is justiﬁable only when it is a
creative work in itself.”

Pointing out the dogmatism of most
destructive critics, Dr. Schoen as-
serted that any criticism of an art
product is a piece of impertinence,
that criticism is not only irrelevant
but irreverent.

When asked about the history of
art, Dr. Schoen declared that there
is no such thing “Art is timeless
and placeless,” he maintained. “A
great artist always attracts disciples,
who act as liabilities. Disciples see

only the great man’s technique, not
the mind behind.”

The speaker distinguished between
the artist and the craftsman on the
importance place-d by both on the ulti-

mate reward. While the artist is in-
terested only in the product itself,
the craftsman is occupied mainly with
the reward involved. “

“Craftsmanship in itself is no art,”
he asserted, to minimize the factual
side of art. “Yet if the work is not
true to life, we feel it to be a de-
lusion. What lies between fact and
delusion constitutes an art product.”

The ﬁnal art product represents
the artist himself. All creative ac-
tivity is of the nature of self-dis-cov-
ery. Therefore, while art is univer-
sal, it is at the same time individual.

“All vital activity is due to an in-
ner drive,” Dr. Schoen concluded.
“No human being works for the sake
of work. The artist produces because
he is spiritually obliged to.”

That there is a place in art for the
critic was the opinion of most of the
students present. The ordinary ob-
server can be deceived by false art
and literature, and it is the purpose
of the critic to judge the good from
the bad, several contended.

“An art product judges us, not we
the art product,” Dr. Schoen an-
swered. “One individual has no right
to distinguish for another the good
from the bad.”

me, especially the younger set; who
nearly tore my clothes off for sou-
venirs when I stepped out of the
plane this morning. Yes, I guess
you’d better cut that last phrase.

* * I!

Miss Fenwick, of course, will be
my leading lady. No, I don’t be-
lieve too many pictures together
will ruin our careers. In fact, I
would even go so far as to say I
am convinced of it. Conﬁdentially,
don’t you think it gives my public
something to mull about? But
don’t quote me on that.

* * *

*

Certainly not.

We are just good
friends.

Speaking of friends, I should
like to make a public statement to
the effect that of all the cities which
I visit, yours seems ‘always to give
me the greatest reception. Nowhere
have I——yes, twenty-four in Sep-
tember, but does it matter?—-—No-
where do I receive such acclaim,
such open-hearted welcome.-Yes,
Springton, Wisconsin, eighteen
ninety-——oh, no, you don’t! I said
twenty-four, remember?

>l< * *

As I say, I feel in my heart a warm
spot for the people of this great me-
tropolis. Yes, I shall stay for the
banquet, but I am afraid I shall have
to hurry away to catch my plane im-
mediately afterwards. Oh, surely, I
shall take a little time out for auto-
graphs. Mustn’t disappoint all the
1ittle——that is, all my wonderful fans.
Better make that just “fans.”

   

when I’m for a thing I'm all for it!’
I like Chesterﬁelds. . . I like ’em a lot

. . .We all go for ’em around here.

Chesterfields are milder. ..and when
it comes to taste--they're SWELL!

for Me good tﬁings

smoking can give you.
