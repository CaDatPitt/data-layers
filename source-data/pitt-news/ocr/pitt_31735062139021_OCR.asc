HOW ABOUT THE OWL?

. C ..
Is there going to be an Owl this
year?‘ This is the question that is

. holding the attefition of the students

at the present time. The answer to
the question is very easy. There is
going to be an Owl, if the students
desire that there be .one——otherwise
_there will not be, a year book put out
by the class of 1914. Thanks to the
supervision of the advisory board on
student activities, it is not likely

. that any student publication of the
University will ever be put out at a

great loss, as has beenthecase too

stud_en't publications must render re-
ports from time to time and/no ‘or-
ganization; will be permitted to run up
accounts and make contracts, unless
they can furnishample proof that they

‘have the ﬁnancial backing to vmake
' good their obligations.

If there is to'be an Owlﬁthis year,
there must be $1,000 paid into the
business office of the Owl before the
middle. of February. Thisis ‘a con-
servative estimate of the amount of
money that ought to be on hand be-
fore the Owl board makes any-con-
tracts whatsoever. If the students
want to have the yearbook published,
theymust see that this amount is in
the possession of theiOwl manager
not‘ later than February 18. It
is a question that comes right
home to every student._ Every in-
dividual that does not pay at least
a dollar down on the Owl before the
above date is adding materially to the
possible disgraqe of not having a
yearbook at Pitt this year.

There is hardly a man thatis en-
rolled in the University that is not
able to .pay his quota of two dollars,
(or ﬁve dollars for juniors) to the
Owl, and if there be any that have not
the money, the editor of the Owlha’s
offered to ﬁnd employment for these
rrfen so that they may be able to
make enough money to pay [their
assessment. -. It is a very small ‘sum
to pay for a book of such value and
every man ought to get his name on
a subscription blank at once.

The manuscripts have been pre-
pared for the book—-‘everything is
practically ready for the publication
of the Owl, except the ‘money. Now

it is up to the students to make good.
If you want to have .an Owl this year

-(and we believe that everyone does)
get busy and nay your assessment to

I

often  the»past. From now on all

the managerof the Owl in your de-
partment, and ‘see that your fellow
stiidents ,make their contributions. It

is -up to you, students, to have the 1914 .
Owl. I W

 

WHAT IS ADVISORY BOARD?

Many students have the wrong im-
pression concerning the relation of
the Advisory Board on student activi-
ties to ﬁhelvarious student organiza-
tions of Pitt. There seems to be a
feeling among many of the under-
graduates ‘that the board is composed
of a‘ group of men who desire to have
the whole say in the matter of student
organization, who desire to hinder
and obstruct the work of these va-
rious organizations. This idea is, in-
deed, a very unjust one to the mem-
bers of the board. ' There is not*"‘a
manson the board that ‘has not the
best interests of the students at heart
and that does not rejoice inthe suc-
cess" of’ any or all of the @r.ler-
graduate organizations. '

The real work of this body is to
give advice to the managers of the
various organizations «in the Univer-
sity, and to keep them from_getting
into embarrassing straits. Many
members of the board are men of
large experience in the business world
and men that understand all the work-
ings of every day "business trans-
actions. They know, for instance,
that’ to launch any proposition, such
as the publication of the Owl, or THE
PITT WEEKLY, without

aster. to the publication, the ‘loss of
credit to that organization among the
business men of the city, and the plac-
ing of a blot upon the University and

the members of_.»the undergraduate’

body. Knowing these facts,"they in-’
sist that the student publications of
the University and all the other
organizations of the inst'tution be run

on a business like ‘basis, or that they’

be given up. It is ‘better not to have
any PITT WEEKLY or Owl than to
have them run into debt every year, is
their motto. ' ’

Do not listen’-to the man that says
that the A.isory Board is a body of
men th-at.want to boss the students

for the sake of bossing them. If you‘

will only take the time to look -into
the work that has been accomplished,
byvthis board, you will ﬁnd that they”
are doing a great work for the Uni-
versity and its students.

and a general good time, with danc-

all. Some time ago the chapter had
the pleasure of entertaining the
Chancellor and Drs. Frost and Lin-
hart. All these made interesting re-
marks on various topics of student
interest and teferred to their own fra-

QUERIES, AND ANSWERS.

Sporting Editor:— .

‘In the W..& J.—-Pitt baseball game
last spring, Pitt had three men on
when Red Smith hit a fast one past
the inﬁeld which the outﬁelder should
have ﬁelded but the ball got away from

him and rolled to the fence. All four
runners scored. The hit was a clean

fectly but as the ﬁelder misjudged the
bounce it went for a homer. The
scorer gave Red a single and the
ﬁelder an error. Was this right?

SOPH.
This was a mistake. On this play
Red .should have been crdited with a
home run and the ﬁelder should not
have received an error as.'*the ball
took a bad bound and eluded him. I

have seen an easy out turned into a
home run several times by just such
an error of judgment. 'Owen Wilson,
of the Pirates, overran a pop ﬂy once
‘several years ago which counted for
the circuit. Tommy Leach let a sin-
gle roll between his legs for a homer
and was not credited with an error.

In both casesethe batter w_as given .a

home run in the statistics. It is also
wrong to charge a hit and an error on
this play.

Sporting Editor:— .
Did a relay team from Pig ever
winone of Penn’a races? R.

Pitt scored iﬁrst place in her class
in 1896 and has ﬁnished second since
except in 1911 when last place was the
best the team could do. Dr. Fetter-
man was a member of the 1896 Relay
Team and still wears the gold Watch
that he won. Ask him to let you see
it. V ~ ‘

 

I have heard Pitt would have-a box-
ing team this year. Is this true?

The matter‘ OII supporting a boxing
team was brought up at a meetingof
the Athletic Committee last year but‘
nothing was done. It is probable that
this branch of sport will be started
next fall.

Sporting Editor :— V

Have any of the football men quit
or been dropped from classes since the
season ended? Who were they?

Every man who won a “P” in foot-
ball last season is in school now and
I do not think that any intend drop-
ping out. ’ ~ ,3 "

Freshmen Win From Sophs.

The Gold and Blue basket ball ﬁve
easily defeated the Bellefonte Acad-
emy-teiam at Trees Gym last Friday,
thereby making the season’s victories.
‘five ‘out of six games played. The op-
ponents were badly outclassed in the
ﬁrst half, when the ﬁrst string men
‘held ‘them to at ﬁeld goal and two
fouls, mean-while rolling up 23 points,
but the_y .did much better later in -the
-contest after _Coach Flint had sent in
his‘ subs. '
..__ Capt. Campbell played the star role
of the game, as he kept his opponent
closely guarded and tossed ﬁve ﬁeld
. _"goals. The new lineup presented by
Pitt looks by far the strong_est yet
tried. Reese, on a_ccount of hisvsize
{took the center position from “Butch”

~ ' ‘Ochsenhirt, but the‘ latter is entirely

"too good ‘to warm- the bench, so

Coach Flaint shifted him to Frishman’s
‘guard and put Frishman at forward.

TH ORPE LOSES LAURELS.

Jim Thorpe, the world's greatest
athlete, lost his hard-earned lahurels
when President Sullivan of the A. A.
U. declared that Thorpe has been a
professional since the spring of 1909,
when he played ball for a semi-pro
baseball nine in the East. By this
decree, Thorpe will lose all records
established in the A. A. U. meets
since 1909, which includes the win-
ning of7the All Round Athletic Cham-
pionship- the past Fall. _His name and
mark will be stricken from all the
A. A. U. documents and the competi-
tors ﬁnishing behind the noted Indian
star will each be moved up one place.

The trouble started when a New
England sheet claimed that Thorpe
had played ball for a professional ball
team in North Carolina and the A. A.
U. head immediately took steps to
prove the assertion, He ﬁnally re-
ceived a letter from Thorpe stating
that he had played for the team men-
tioned and there was no way out of it
for President Sullivan.

Carlisle School is in mourning for
their idol and it will probably be many
a year before this or any other in-
stitution will turn out such a wonder-
ful athlete as Thorpe.

‘ FRESHMEN PLAY TONIGHT.

Manager Downing of the Freshman
ﬁve has arranged a game tonight with

BASKET BALL TEAM
WILL LEAVE FOR EAST.

 

 

Following the Mt. Unionigame to-
night, the basketball team will play
six games in as many nights on_for-
eignu ﬂoors. ‘Manager M‘acQuown’s
schedule calls for games with George-
town, Mt. St. Marys’, Penn’a College
(Gettysburg), F. & M., Swarthmore
and Lehigh. This isia ﬁne string of-
games and Pitt’s hustling contest
grabber_has_~ received much"commenda-
tion since he published his schedule.

Coach‘Flint fully realizes what, his,
ﬁve will have to accomplish and will
be pleased if -three victories ‘are won

on the'trip. He will probably use
Reese at center, Baker and Frishman
at forward and Capt. Campbelland
Ochsenhirt at guard as thisseems the
strongest combination available. Sev-
eral subs will be needed on the trip
and once the game is “sewed up,” the.
varsity men will retire in order to be
in shape for the next contest..

' Capt. Campbell, Frishman and Och-

senhirt were on the same trip last
year in w.hich 2 games were won out
of six. M '

The team will leave Sunday night
for Washington, D. C.

Manager Gray of the Pitt Fencing
Team is in teceipt of a communica-
tion from Manager .Keister of the
Navy‘ Team, asking for a- dual fenc-
ing meet with Pitt for February 1, at
Annapolis. As the Pitt team is to_
compete in the Intercdllegiate"Fenc-
ing meet at Annapolis in March, ‘it is
thought better not to take on the

date will not be taken. A ’ ~

BOARD OF CONTROL.

 

The University Board of Control,
at its meeting on Saturday evening,
January 25, made important decisions

concerning the drinking cups in the

halls’. Some time ago, the cup-vend-
ing machines were broken into, and
some cups stplen. The Board of Con-
trol decided thatboth paper and ordin-
ary glass cups shall be kept in the
buildings in the future, in order that
those who do not wish to buy paper
cups may have some other means of
satisfying their thirst.

partment recently, C. R. Helt, man-
ager of the Owl board, said:

“Unless . we have the required
amount of money on hand by the mid-
dle of February there will be no Owl
this "year. There is no two ways
about this question. It «is up, to the
students of the University and espe-
cially the rnembers of the junior class
to rally to the support of the Owl.
It is a matter that is entirely up to
the students, whether we have an Owl
this year or not.” 1

The students of the various depart-
ments will‘ hand their subscriptions
to the Owl managers of their respec-
tive departments. The managers in
the departments are:

- College—J. C. Cuthbert.

that has been made to date on the
desired fund.
