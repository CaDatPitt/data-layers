After Bowl Classic

After winning everything but the ball/game in New 01‘-

leans’ Sugar Bowl last week,the Panther gridders returned‘ '

to Pittsburgh Thursday afternoon to hit the books instead
of tackling dummies. * ‘

Coach John lVIichelosen’s crew of burly footballers did
a lot of winning while in ‘the southland. They won the hearts
of the south, the favor of the fans, the praises of the Sugar
Bowl committee, and the statisticsof the game. They won

1. everything in fact but the ball game.

In 1 what was maybe the best football clash the Sugar
Bowl has seen in its 22 years of existence, the hardy Panthers

against Tech’s 146 via rushing
and nothing in the air.

The all-important touchdown
elu-de-Id the lPanti1ers, however,
even though they had three big
opportunities. With seconds to
go in the first half, Corny Sal-
vaterra failed to push the ball
over from the one—yard line on
a sneak play and the ball went
to Bobby Do»dd’s .gridders’ on
downs.

Again in the second \half, Mi-
chelosen’s footballers saw a scor-
ing opportunity go up in air when
the alert Engineers intercepted a
Panther aerial on the Tech 21.

Bought at an estimated cost
of $3,000,000, the Apartments
will be converted into much-
needed dormitory space, de-
signed to attract the out-of-town
student. The sudden announce_.
ment of the unexpected purchase
also makes it possible for gthe
University to have much more rec-
reational space than the previ-
ously-proposed Student Union
could hold. ' , '

According to Acting Chancellor
Charles B. Nutting, the recently
purchased Schenley Park Apart-
ments will have “facilities of a

type which would go into a stu- ’

dent union.” _ L
The‘ apartment buildings, near
the Schenley Park Hotel (which
is not included in the purchase)
will be gradually converted for
student use. Dr. Nutting stated,
“We intend to treat the present
tenants with every consideration.”
‘ Plans Not Formulated

Plans for the conversion work.

to be done are not yet formulate-:t;
the real estate dealings were sat-
isfactorily concluded less than two
weeks after they were initiated.
Plans for building a student
union on a site behind Clams.
Hall have been deﬁnitely aban-
doned. The apartments will pro-
vide the facilities which the
proposed union would have
boasted, in addition to dormi-
tory facilities for students and
faculty. There will be space to
house from 1,000 to 1,500 stu-
dents. ' '
Tentative date for the comple-
tion of conversion, 1960, is sooner
than ’the estimated date for the
construction of a student union.

Action Taken Dec. 22

The Apartments will become.

the l1t'0perty_of Pitt as a result of
action taken Dec. 22 by the pres--

ent owners and the Pitt board of A

trustees. Dr. Alan M. Scaife, pres--
ident of the board, stated that all

o w. Wlmt a Gift.

So sudden was the purchase of the Schenley Apartments
that even most University personnel were unaware of the"
move until it appeared over radio and in the newspapers.
But it hit like a hurricane and bowled over even the most
staid of professors. , »
_ In one blow, masterminded by such men as Chairman of
the Board of Trustees Alan B. Scaife and Leon _Falk, Pitt

 had gained its long sought dormitory and facilities for its

, .,Student Union. Parking spacesare also available underneath

' the 7 buildings of apartments.

  The purchase was virtually a gift. When they were
originally built, the apartments ‘cost $4,500,000. The Univer-
sity paid $3,000,000. It will take another million dollars to
his , “ovate the interior to make over the 238 apartments.into

!’i-‘ﬁiliising facilities for from 1,000 to 1,500 students and faculty.

, Lest we be tooeager, occupancy will be dalayed until

l959, at the latest. There are present residents who "must ﬁnd ’
new homes and, of course, architectural changes” that must _,

‘ -be made. But the time should be’ welcome to planners who
‘ must now decidethe most efficient’ ways to use the apart-
ments. ' . ' ‘

, ,"Pote'ntial is enormous. For the ﬁrst time, faculty mem-

News requesting more publicity

and more prominent positions

erage, even offering payment for

such services.
The editors
of the News
recognize the
plight of these '
0 r ganizations.
We wish .we
had an unlim-

we, too, are

fraternities, 20 professional fra-
ternities, 11 recognition frater-
nities, religious groups, interest
groups, and military organiza-
tions. «

Space Problem

To‘give full coverage to all
these groups would be an im-
possible task. If we had an un-
limited supply of reporters,
which we don’t, we might be
able to cover all meetings and
social events of each group. But

then we face the problem of

space.
The Pitt -News operates on a
relatively small-budget. All our

While we ‘should like-to see an

ture, there is a noticeable laclc

 

possible for classroom programs
to carry out extended discussion
due to the time element, the
schools have conducted extra-
"curricular programs to supple-
ment. Whether all such activities
have proven useful is a difficult

question to answer because there .

are so many of them geared for
different persons and purposes.

' Useless Activities?

That there are some useless ac-
tivities with no connection to ac-
ademic purpose might be more
easily proven. Talking with the

' Harvard female, again, we learn-

ed that she had found too many
extra duties to occupy her time
that proved nollow all too soon
after graduation. Men, too, have

no doubt participated extensive—_

ly only to. take a breather‘ soon
after a job has been completed---
with little actually accomplish-
ed. ‘ ‘
Before the holiday vacation be-
gan, senior Student Congress
representative Joe Banik looked

around_him to see what there;

was his group and others were
actually -doing on campus.

spite University efforts to de-
velop students for everyday liv-
ing and thinking, there is no’ way
men and women can express

A open opinion concerning vital na-

tional‘ and international issues
that might in some"way concern
students. ’

There is no organization on
campus which can serve as a
sounding board for student opin-
ion, whether— it be‘ local‘FEPC
procedure or national elections-

Issue For Congress

The only such body that might

carry weight of student opinion
was St/udent Congress—-a com-

.paratively latent body-politic to

date. Its very being was con-
ducive, not only to discussion of

parking "issues, but also of na—_

tional points of interest to stu-
dents. A

Having heard that Wisconsin
students were discussing the as-
pects of /the McCarran-Walter
Internal Security Act of 1950,
Banik urged Pitt SC executive
committee to look into the prob-
lem to see how it might affect
Pitt ‘students also.

Here he was stymied. President
Bob Sedler came.out with an
a'll-too typical statement ‘ “This
is not a debating society.” Being

lotment. In previous years we
have been able to create a re-
serve fund on which we could
fall back on" in case of emergen-
cies.

But, in the past few years, the
editors have tried to give the
student body a greater number
of issues yearly in which there
is a wider coverage of news
illustrated by more pictures and
cartoons. Thus, operating costs
have increased tremendously.

To cope with the problem of
coverage we print Pittpourri, a
bi—weekly column announcing
meetings and social events of all
organizations which submit their
publicity to our Society Editor.

Cater to Majority

When writing and placing

A large stories, we try to give the

biggest play, to those we feel
will interest“ or involve the
greatest number of students.
And after all, that is the only
goal towards which an editor
can aim.

Several organizations have

. offered, to pay for their publi-

city—bribery of a sort. If we
permitted such practices we
could rightly be accused of dis-
criminating against less wealthy
groups. If these larger groups
have extra money at their dis-
posal and want a little extra
publicity an ad might serve their
purpose._ This should be taken
up with the.Business staff and

mber,  .

realize that few diﬁerent topics
are argued each year, although

they are of major importance.

He should also realize that de-

bate is only the expression -of’

the individual, not student body.

Prexy Not At Fault ,
But Sedler is not all at fault.
The SC President who,. by the
way, made a ﬁne impression for
the school as Eleanor Leslie’s
Sugar Bowl escort, is one of the
ﬁner students, capable of both
critical thinking and lucid ex-
pression. But many of his ac-
tions are based on precedent and,

"to date, there has been little

precedent in SC for such discus-

sion other than argument over_

joining the National Student As-
sociation a few. years ago.
Student Congress has based its
work, as have ‘all student gov-
ernment associations to date,
upon an unwritten code that calls
for few controversial issues and
only those that relate directly
to the student in Pitt. ,
Possibly, the written support
for such an‘ attitude stems from
the COROSO (Committee ,on
Recognition of Student Organiza-
tions) statement of policy. item
#3 reads: “It (the organization)
shall not aﬂiliate with any or-
ganization or movement outside
,the"University nor accept out-
side ﬁnancial support without the

‘ consent of COROSO.”

Unnatural Reaction

Certainly that is
for student interest during pres-
idential elections. But might it

not also discourage some people

from maintaining national party -

affiliates on campus? Does it
seem unnatural that there is no
young Democrat or young Re-
publican effort continuously, on‘
campus for example? It does to’
this columnist.

Personally, I feel Student Con-
gress should discuss this issue

and should attempt to resolve for . .1
_ the beneﬁt of thinking Pitt stu-

dents some means‘by' which the
student body might express its
majority opinion‘ on issues of na-
tional or international import‘-_
ance so that they, too, may have
a voice in the lobbies of Capitol"
Hill.  '

Yes, now that we are assured
building strength, we must assure
enough books for personnel and

,_ enough students .-willing to read

from them. ’

space, remains for news stories.
It is a viciofis cycle and one
which little can be done to im-
prove. We .are doing our best
to be fair and unbiased.

Letters Effective

If , readers are dissatisﬁed
with a news,-story, if they dis-
agree with the paper’s stand on
anissue, if they believe the
newspaper has presented a pre-
judiced' report, letters to the

editor should be written. i This ‘

is the most effective way to re-
veal dissenting or assenting
opinions. - ,

Each letter the editor receives
is given careful consideration.
We like _to know when we are
wrong. We appreciate construc-
tive criticism. But we would
like to be given the opportunity
to defend our point publicly, to
explain our action, and even to
admit when we are wrong. If
readers can show us where we
have strayed from the facts, we
will immediately try to rectify
our error.

'The greatest misunderstand-
ing occurring among our read-
ers is the‘ difference between an
editorial and a column. 'An‘
editorial reveals the opinion of
the editorial staff of the paper,
and thus is the stand the paper
takes on anissue.

But a column on the ‘editorial

page, one on which a “by-line” 2

appears, is the opinion of the
writer and his opinion only. It
is notvoicing the opinion of the

 paper. V

soon forgotten by this writer nor by all others who were on

The southern hospitality_ was_ equalled only by the ﬁne im-
pression the Pitt gridders made in the Bowl classic. After see-

West Virginia by 42-7, and Navy over Mississippi by 21-0, the
Sugar Bowl committee members had their ﬁngers crossed hoping

John Weber To Retire
After 50-Year Tenure

Dr. John Weber, secretary of the University and the
University Board of Trustees since 1936, will retire next
June after more than 50 years of service with the Univer-
sity, Board chairman_Alan M. Scaife announced recently.

Dr. Weber, a life long resident of Pittsburgh, was a
student when Pitt was known as the Western University of
Pennsylvania. He Was a member of the ﬁrst graduating class

under the present name.

Following education as a mechanical engineer, he served
’ brieﬂy as an assistant to Professor Reid T. Stewart, consultant
to the National Tube Co. In 1910 he joined the University

of Pittsburgh faculty as an in-
structor in shop work.

Lead Mechanical Engineers

He held successively the posi-
tions of assistant professor, asso-
ciate professor and p'rofessor and
head of the department of me-
chanical engineering, all from the
time, 1913-1926.

In 1926, Chancellor John G.
Bowman appointed him business
manager and supervising engi-
neer of the University. It was
largely under his direction as
supervising engineer that the
Cathedral of Learning, Heinz
Memorial Chapel, and Foster
1VIemorial were planned and
constructed.

In 1936, he was appointed sec-
retary of the University and of
the Board of Trustees. In this po-
sition he has prepared the budget
and budget adjustments. At the
same time he had heavy respon-
sibilities in connection with the
buildin-g and maintenance. pro-
grams of he University.

Attended Cornerstone Ceremony
He received his honorary de-
gree, Doctor of Science, in, 1937 on
the occasion of laying of the cor-
nerstone of the Cathedral. '

Dr. Edward Litchﬁeld, in a
note to Dr. Weber, expressed
gratitude for the advice and as-
sistance given him during the
ﬁrst months of his term as chan-
cellor:

“I_ very much appreciate your

lgenerous assistance given me in

my task of learning the traditions
and problems of the University.
I sincerely hope that you will con-
tinue to offer advice ‘and counsel,

~ out of your long background of

experience with the University in
the months and in the years
ahead.”

General Grants’

Early Ranks to
Army Doctors

Major iGeneral Silas B. Hayes,
Army Surgeon General, recently
announced that physicians will be
eligible for temporary p"omotion
to the rank of major, lieutenant
colonel, and colonel one year soon-
er than other Army ofﬁcers, be-
cause of revised promotion poli-
cies.

As a result of the policy, it is
estimated that 390 medical offi-
cers will be ‘promoted to higher
grades during ‘the period ending
June 30. Consideration is also be-
ing given to more rapid promo-
tion of lieutenants to the grade
of captain.

The action acknowledges the
long and expensive training re-
quired of doctors before they can
qualify for Army commissions. It
was pointed out that these offi-
cers have at least nine years of
training beyond the high school

. level while most other Army offi-

cers have less education at the
time they are commissioned.

Junior and senior medical stu-
dents interested in applying for
a commission in the Army Medi-
cal Service can obtain complete
information by contacting Capt.
Jesse W. Kicklighter, local Army
Medical Procurem e n t Officer,
Room 20'5A in the Old Post Office
Building. '

$75,000 Donated

By Health Service.
For Hospital Aids

A $75,000 grant has been given
to a Pitt scientist in order to
further research projects aimed at
improving hospital administra-
tion.

The grant was issued by the
U. S. Public Health Service to Dr.
John R. McGibony, director of
the program in hospital admini-
stration at the Pitt ,Graduate
School of Public Health.

The money was given to help
in the overall goal of making hos-
pital operations more efficient
and hospital care less expensive.
With this grant used as‘a ground-
work for study, it is anticipated
that researchers may have some
guideposts ‘to follow in seeking
to approve hospital administra-
tion.

ners as “Childrcm’s Hour,” “Har-

Dr. Laufe felt the success of

“Streetcar Named Desire” de-
pended entirely on the leading
actress. Although the said he dis-
liked Tennessee Williams as a
playwright, “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof” is a good play and will
probably have a long run on
Broadway. He said “El Camino
Real,” another William’s play is
very confused. The plays that are
clear are the ones that
end will win public praise and
prizes, he concluded.

Dr. Donald E. Swarts, director

-. Few people know better than Ed Teichert the faults of,

Fteaches remedial reading classes daily at Penn Township

..and

many in my classes won’t ﬁnish school” Ed stated. -All his
students are ranked as sophomores, but have a reading. abili-

Some are older than usual. On one
occasion, he had a burly young-

“ster absent from school for three

days because the boy was serving
national guard duty.

. And in his role as teacher of
such special students, Ed Teichert
confronts both the student who
claims “I ain’t got no use for Eng-

teacher attitude toward poor stu-

thing last year?”
" Changes ‘Johnny’ Query

" According to Teichert, the ques-
tion “Why Johnny Can’t Read?”
is_ thought_- provoking, but more
important is “how can .we teach
him properly?” Although he hasn’t

‘ surveyed far-reaching causes and

effects, the Penn Twp. instructor
claims that home inﬂuence is pres-
ent, but not one of the main rea-
sons for a retarded reader. Gener-
ally, the poor reader has a lower
IQ.
But the problem takes on new
meaning with neither teacher
nor, parent directly responsible,
when it has been found in pro-
gressive Penn Township that
students need to be separated
according to ability/as early as
the ﬁrst grade. '

pleasures that” are in store for
them. This may seem idealistic, he
stated in effect, but not when stu-
dents read books and ..rticles with-
in their frame of experience. In
cooperation with the high school
librarian,- books on mechanics,
“hot rods," customizing cars,‘are
provided to stimulate interest.
‘Moby Dick’ Simpliﬁed ,
When a student shows .a readi-
ness_later in the year to read ad-
vanced types’ of literature’ other
than the selected short stories and
columns,initially offered, or when
the teacher, himself sees ‘the‘op-

portunity to "guide pupils toward

other facets of reading experience,
he points out simpliﬁed versions of
such classics as “Moby Dick" to
those who .are interested in the
sea. - . ~
But success is not quick. Hand-
ling such a course, one hardly
looks for rapid improvement,
Teichert stressed. Rather, each
positive reaction pr’ovides enough
encouragement to merit further
effort. '

cites the example of a big “bruis-

Teichert stated, happy himself.
Grading Deempnasized;
’One' of his biggest problems,
Teichert states, occurs at the be-
ginning of each new year with
a new class. “It ‘takes from three
to four weeks to get out of their
minds that they will be graded or
tested on everything they do.”
Once adjusted,‘ students fol-
low a weekly routine, reading
stories in a. standard textbook
and then taking self-evaluation
