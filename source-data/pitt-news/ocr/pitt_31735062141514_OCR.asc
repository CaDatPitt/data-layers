The Second Annual Home Concert

.-"of the;University Band will be given .

Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
April 18 and 19, in the Carnegie Mu-
zsic Hall. The week of March 12 has
, been deci ‘ed upon as time when the
accredited students in the various
S Lsschools -will receive through the
Deans’ olﬁces. their exchange tickets.
 iNo student will be given an ex-
H . -change“ ticket after Friday, March 16.
' It is suggested that all students re-
' member the exchange dates and get
}'',their tickets on time. Heretofore it
‘  ;‘has been the practice to give the ex-
, A .~chan1ge"ti-ckets out over a long period‘.
causing much trouble, not only with
the students, but it-has been of great
. inconvenience’ to the office force of
the Dean’s oﬁices. It isthe intention
‘of those in charge of the concert to
'_ eliminate as many diﬂiculties as pos-
 sible.‘ . ‘
.,; ‘ * With the giving
/ ltickets to the students at a deﬁnite
time, it can be deﬁnitely ascertained
V just how many tickets will be avail-
S  ‘,able for the‘ Alumni and general'pub-
lic.3 Last year a large part of the~au-
dience was composed of the Alumni
, and the friends of the band {outside
"of the,University, and at the present
,_ time many inquiries have been re-
_  __ceived relative as to when the public
, ” ‘sale will start and just what tickets
” will be available. ‘ .
_ - On the exchange ticket givenout to
 — the student, the place and date of
_ '0  exchange for the seat ticket willbe
if t_fl'made. These exchange tickets will
 be exchangeable only on the dates as
 speciﬁed. J ‘ ' .
 Each student will be required to
" ._ apply 2 for his or her exchange ticket
in person and during the exchange
period. No student will be permitted
 to exchange ,more than one ticket.
3  However, any student who desires to
purchase additional tickets for mem-
 bers of the family orfriends, may do‘
‘: .iso by paying cash for the additional
- ;' tickets. _
 The "band members are working to
_‘.{;1nal<;e this concert the best they have
. ,_ever ‘given, and at" the present time
A .3 !ﬁDirector Rocereto and Band Director
9   Davis are__wel1 satisﬁed with the re-
fhearsals of the band, and ‘feel as-

Miss Royden to Give

   

Lecture at Mosque

 

Many University -girls have taken
advantage of the opportunity to hear
Miss Maude Royden, who is to lecture
at Syria Mosque next.Tuesday, March
6, on the subject .“Can We Set the
World in Order?” Miss Royden is a
world famous character. “The Gen-
tlemanu With the Duster,”.the anony-
mous author of the well known book,
‘1‘T.he( Mirrors «of Downing -Street,’’.
and of “Painted Windows.” reveals,.in

things about Miss Royden. It is
noteworthy that of all the famous.
church ﬁgures whom the author dis-
cusses, Miss Royden is the only one
that he-does not criticise. Miss Roy-
den‘ was born a cripple with both hips
dislocated, but this handicap- has not
prevented her from attaining the ﬁrst
rank among progressive women. Her’
-‘ﬁrst work was in connection with a
settlement in the slums of-Liverpool.
In 1908 she joined the Woman Suf-
frage movement and used all her ef-
iforqs’ towiard securing freedom for
"women. She found that people came
to hear her, not because -of their in-
terest in women’s suffrage. iSihe ﬁn-
ally developed her ‘life work‘ as: an
advocate of personal religion. ‘She
is one of the most persuasive preach-
ers of the power of Christianity in
any English speaking ~c-ountry. She
impresses one, , not by -the force of
her intellect, but by the force of her
humanity. ,,

tion for Sophomore girls, ‘has been
given"oﬂicial recognition by‘ the Uni-
versity authorities. '
The purpose of the organization as
set forth in its constitution is “to fos-_
ter leadership and fellowship among}
the women of the Sophomore class of"
the University; to promote by friend-"
ly supervision leadership among the“
Freshman ' women by encouraging‘
their participation‘ in student activi-
ties and genuine interest in scholar-
ship; “to foster a spirit of sportsman-_
ship among Freshmen by supporting
such hazing rules and regulations as
may be made; and through the realie
zation of these purposes to develop in
the Freshman and Sophomore classed.
Pitt spirit and the highest ideals of
-womanhood.” ‘ . ' ',
_The organiaztion is non-sectarian
and independent of fraternity inter-
ests. Its members will be active only
during their Sophomore year. Fresh-
men will be elected to membership in
May and will be judged by their
scholastic standing, interest in activi-
ties and qualities of leadership.

diately. Prices for the rings will ‘be

B’BAll BANQUET
DATE ciiliiiiiii 
e in MAR. 13    

The date of the second annual bas-
ket b-all. banquet has been changed
from Tuesday evening, March .13, to
Thursday evening, March 15. The Y.
M. C. A. feels that it is better to

 

at Belleﬁeld avenue and, Bayard
street, where the banquet willbe held.
This church is in the heart of the

organizations, including the Pitkin

‘Club an'd the World Forum Group,

hold their regular meetings there.
The committees have been meet-

working with the expectation of mak-
ing the second annual basket ball
banquet on a level with the football
banquets and are devoting their ‘ef-
forts to this purpose. A large num-.
ber of events are being planned by
the committees. ‘ ‘

“Lou” McMa.sters, Freshman bas-
ket ball ‘coach, and “Red” Carlson,
varsity coach, will ‘each have a few
words to ‘say during the evening.
Paul Byers,‘ present’ varsity captain
and the captain for next year, who
will be elected just before the ban-
quet, will be called upon’ to speak.
There will be other talks of the same
caliber as these given at the first bas-
ket ball banquet last year.

A heavy demand for tickets is al-
‘ready in evidience. The l}nter-fra-
'ter11ity' Council has pledged to take
over 200, and it is expected that many
alumni, non-frat men, and the evening
school students will attend. Frater-
nity men will get their tickets from_
their fraternity representatives. Oth-
ers may buy tickets from members
of the Y. C. A., Open. Forum, cabi-
net members, at Mr. Hoehl’s office in
State Hall, or at the “Y” hut.

The tickets for the banquet"are one
dollar.

The fact that the use of the church
is being given_ free- to the Y. M. C. A.
alone makes possible the low price
of the ticket and the high quality of
the proposed meal. This year’s menu‘
will be a general repetition of the one
had last year; ’

A strong bid is being made this
year for alumni uattendance. Former
basket ball players especiallyeare be-
ing urged to attend. The alumni end
of the banquet is bei_ng handled by
Herbert McCracken and George Car-
son. A large number of alumni were
at the ﬁrst banquet and the commit-
teehopes to have all of themtogether
with another large number at this
year’s banquet.

-hroughout the ‘college year our American universities and col-
‘those of which are the seats of chapters of Greek-letter frater-

 initiatfed into the secrets of such groups. These numbers of as-
pirants are great! Butmore important than the numbers themselves

A  year annually these persons pass through a period of instruc-
io'1i'.land’ discipline which cannot be expressed in terms other than
c périence. ,

The "several national undergraduate? social fraternities are so-
i5esf:of much tradition and history.’ Many such date back three-
at-‘tors of a century; have gradually established large numbers of
iiggchapters in-representative colleges; and built up large alumni
ciations throughout the American cities.‘ The more infant fra-
rnities have not yet attained the‘ same full degree of‘ regard and

1ese7js'ocieties too demand like respect a_nd seek equal rating‘ with

If you are soon to be an alumna of
your'co11ege—in other words, if you
are a. Senior girl——you are probably
wondering what you will ever do
without the college associations, the
organization in which you have work-
ed so long and interestedly. It isn't
necessary to worry long‘ over that
matter, for here -is an organization
just ready and waiting for you and
your energies.-—the American Associa-
tion of University Women. Your
Alma Mater. has met all the require-
ments of,.this association so that it is
possible for you to become a mem
her. This association offers an op-
portunity for you to make new friends
with college women from 130 colleges

‘of, the United States, continue your

old associations and ﬁnd an outlet

for all the energies you have left over

from commencement days. If you are
planning to teach or enter one of the
many professions,‘ there may be a
branch in your new home town, and
you can at once ﬁnd companions and
make new friends. If you -are inter-
ested in foreign study there are a
number of fellowships offered. If you
are planning to travel in, this country
or abroad‘ there are_ club houses in
various _cities' whose privileges may
be yours upon certain_ conditions. i'If
you are interested in meeting women
students of foreign countries this is
possible through the club houses
which are being established gradually
in various capitals of these countries.
You are able to. have this opportunity
because the A. A. U. W. is one of the
seventeen national. college associa-
tions represented in the International
Federation of University Women. Col-
lege women, from - these seventeen
countries meet’ for an international
conference once in.two years and
discuss the problems of education in
their various countries. Most inter-
esting acquaintances aud friendships
are formed in this manner;

In your own country, you are ena- ,

bled to meet women of all ages and
experiences and colleges and work
with them in things that add culture
and education to all phases of Amer-
Some of the most promin-

country areumembersg and are coming
‘to regard the National"~Club House at

Washington as the place for. meeting ,

other college women for conferences
upon all ‘possible subjects. Some of
the nationally known women who are
members are Mrs. Herbert Hoover,
Mrs.
ﬁeld Fisher, Annette Adams, First
United States Assistant Attorney
General of the United States Judge
Florence Allen, ﬁrst woman judge;
Lucille‘ Atcherson, ﬁrst woman secre-

tary to embassy of the United States;

Julia Lathrop, formerly head of the

"The speaker, in discussing ‘the pos-
sibilities for college men in the ﬁelds,

'of accounting, banking and“ real es-

tate, stated: “Opportunity. is ever
present. A college ..e.ducation- does not
create opportunities. But‘ rather it
opens one’s eyes to the opportunities
presented.. Failures. in life are the re-
sult of the failure to "see opportuni-
ties.”  Royston further remarked:
“The, college man’s place is to create
work for the rank and ﬁle.” In con-
tinuing his talk, the speakercited spe-
ciﬁc opportunities in the ﬁelds of ac-
counting, real estate and ﬁnance. ~ .
Dr. M. ‘K. McKayJof the School of

-the club." In a short talk earlier, in

contacts which are the ‘foundations
for the future success of its members.

EDUCATIONALNLAWS
  TOPIC 01-‘ ADDRESS

 

Mrs. J. 0. Miller, state chairman of
the League of Women Voters, was the
speaker at the convocation held in the
Heinz House last Friday at noon. Mrs.
Miller is an authority on state legis-
lation andshe spoke of what she has
personally observed at Harrisburg.

“Legislation at Harrisburg of Inter-
est to College Women”_ was her topic
and she conﬁned‘ herself chieﬂy to
educational legislation. '. This legisla-
tion is of great. interest to college
women since-so large a per cent of
the women, graduates become teach-
ers;~. Mrs.=-Miller spoke particularly of
the Edmund;-*. act which is an apf)l‘o-
priation act for higher salaries and
by which qualiﬁcations necessary for"-
entering the teaching ‘ﬁeld have been
raised. Teacliers have been given un-‘
til the summer of 1927 to fulﬁll these
requirements.‘ Teachers’ salaries have
been low and there has been little in-
centive to induce college -graduates to
go into ‘the educational ﬁeld,'but con-
ditions have been greatly improved in-
the last few years. ' - A
Mrs. Miller said that the legislators
would rather appropriate money to
build bridges than to give to educa-
tional work.‘ She stated that if " Dr.

perintendent of education state educa-
tional work would become a political
game. ‘She highly commended Dr.’
Fin'eg_an’s work in the educational’de-
partrnent, and ‘told the girls of the
part’ they might play in bringing
about better conditions in educational
work.

'vFOLLY.O'F VINDECISION I

43

 

“‘Indecision,”' declares Dr. Frank
Crane, in _a recent issue ofthe Amer-
ican Magazine, “‘is the worst of bad
habits.” This statement is » particu-
‘larly_ applicable‘ to college students
who are continually wasting and frit-
tering away time on ‘account of__ hesi-
tation and lack of determination. It
‘is surprising how much time is wast-
ed by. many Apersonsin making de-
-cisions about triﬂes. How much
time is wasted each’day in deciding
wvhat collar and -what necktie to wear,
which; suit to don, what to. eat for
breakfast, -what newspaper to buy,
what studies to take during -the
semester, what to say and how to
act underevery conditionand every
‘circumstance? n .- _ _

It would be interestingto attempt
to answerthe puzzle of ‘how we ar-
-rive at our decisions, how’ we come
to the conclusion to_ act in a certain
way in response to certain_stimuli.
Some ‘of _our actions are instinctive,
others are the products of reason. It
is to the‘ study of; the latterthat we.
should address ourselves. _We should
cultivate the faculty of ‘making up
our minds rapidly. .This does‘ not
mean that we should make snap
judgments; but that after an accur-
ate and careful survey of the situa-
tion, we should know What to do. We
dilly-da.lly too much when there is no

' “BROKE”; ‘STUDENTS

 

It is often said that to be collegiate
is to be “broke.” Anyway it is rare-
ly that collegiate students get I to-
gether that some one of the crowd
does not inform his fellows that he is
“down to bedrock” and that if his al-
lowance doesn’t appear, or if his “ship
doesn?t come in’? before‘ long ‘he will
be an object of charity. The basis
of such light and 'jocular expressions
as to the ﬁnancial-status of these
students may be a near fact at times.
but it does seem that the frequency
with which it is used would indicate
thafgait is more often abluff. ’

-College: students, more than any
other class of people are obliged to
live within an allowance,’ and this
alloted sum is far -below their. poten-
tial spending power. A _student’s
needs and demands for money aggre-
gate a sum that is elastic to‘ the nth
degree. If he hasthe will and the
inclination to continue in school. he
can get "along on a. small pittance in-
deed, but if the opportunity present-
ed itself whereby». he could have ac-
cess to an unlimited bank account, his

-expenditures would leap into start-

ling ﬁgures. .'Our_personal expenses
are largely what we choose to make
them. -There. are certain expenses
which are standard, nearlythe same
for all students, but those necessary
items of expense lack much of being
the total.

The overworked expression “I am
ﬂat broke” is too ‘often used ‘as an

‘a shield from~ assuming an obligation
which it is plainly a dutyto ‘assume.
There'are a great many, worthy caus-
es which should be supported by col-

ethical, social and personal subjects
which will be lead by members of the
faculty in the spare hours during the
day. This movement, under the’ di-

ported by Dr. S. B. Linhartfhas ob-
tained the services of Dean J. C. Fet-

L. I. MacQueen of



Public Speaking Department, Pro-
fessor-Hatﬂeld of the History_Depart-
ment and several. other faculty‘ mem-
bers whose names. will be‘ announced
later, to lead these discussion groups.

The discussion groups’ are anqan-
swer to a growing demand for some
agency for the co-operation of. the
faculty with -the student body in solv-
ing various questions of-personal in-
terest. to the student. Such groups
have been organized in m'an'y*-univer-
sities throughout the country and
have proved a popular as well as-su'c-
cessful experiment. _ . ’ '

The project has been endorsed by
many‘men on" the campus including

Lloyd Jordan, Charles Bowser, Left '

Hill and Tommy Holleranl " I v , '
_To introduce these groups,_,le‘tters
will be sent to the men who have
been active in Y. M. ‘C. A. and in
other student activities, asking‘ that
the‘men enroll in one of the groups
containing _the schedule of the differ-
ent “groups, with the names of the
faculty members" who will_ have
charge of them. . However these
groups are not closedto any who do
not receive letters. Everyone. is wel-
come and may make arrangements
through friends who have .,.joined dis-
cussion groups -or at the office of the
Y. M. C. A. secretary.
Classes will commence sometime
groups will gradually be ‘added to the
schedule as the demand warrants. In
other universities the growthof the
idea has been steady, and the author-
ities here hope for similar extension.
The Y. M. C. A. and the faculty feel
that the students will welcome -this

THE cI.AssIcAL LANGUAGES

 

Classical language is no longer re-
quired for a degree at Yale, accord-
ing to a recent announcement. There
are very few schools in the English
speaking nations that now hold the.
classics“ essential for a college, educa-
tion; afthough~ many educato1's -argue
that "a. great deal ,_of culturemis‘ de-
rived from the study of Greek and
Latin; this may be true, but ancient
art and science can be imparted with-
outa knowledge of the dead lan-

-guages; ‘again there has been such ;

rapid advances in science and art
during the modern age that the clas-
sics" have lostsome of the importance
attached to theseésubjects a genera-_
The Romance languageshave be-'
come more in demand than ’before.
this is perhaps partly, due to the con-
nections with ‘some of our allies dur-
ing theiworld war. Anyhow the
average’ student is perhaps .more in-
terested in the present than in the
distant past.-—The Carnegie Ta.1'tan..

BIIILIIIIYPPIIIIIESSIIII IT won ‘I
on Plllsllllllﬂllilll nrsnncn

Dr. E. F. Adolf of the Biology De-
partment has been actively intere-sted
in special physilogical research work
conducted jointly by .the ‘American
Society of Heating and Ventilating
Engineers, The U. .S‘-. Public Health
Service and the U. S. Bureau of
Mines at the 1ater’s building, 4800
Forbes street.

Dr. Adolf and his associates have
as their chief problem the physilogic-
.al disturbance in 'the human_ body
caused by high temperature. It" has
been previously ascertained that high
temperature disturbs the circulatory

‘system, affecting héart and lung ac-

tion. Concomit-antly the equilibrium
of the acid-base in the blood has been
found to _cause su-ch a disturbance.
Just how- high temperature affects
the acid-base and if it really does is
what these men are trying to ﬁnd out.

An elaborate set’ of apparatus,’ in-
struments, machines and other labo-
ratory 'equipment has been in-stalled
for the work comprising an expendi-
ture estimated as from $20,000 to
$30,000. To operate the apparatus
and to employ subjects for one ex-
periment alone costs $75. ,

Two separate. rooms, sealed, insu-
lated, and ﬁlled with ingenious’ de-
vices are used to accurately control
air conditions. An air duct forms a
passageway for regulated and meas-
ured air to enter the rooms. ‘Outside
and nearby the sealed rooms ‘are in-
tricate machines, valves, and instru-
ments which collect air, bring it to
a desired degree of saturation, heat it
to a temperature slightly above that
of the rooms, and automatically keeps
it at a ﬁxed humidity and degree of
heat. _-
Three or more subjects arefplaced.
in the sealed rooms for the purpose
of observing physilogical reaction to
controlled air conditions. Valves to

‘control the automatic system of ﬁxed

humidity and temperature are within
the rooms, asalso are fans to create

» air currents and instruments to re-

port -conditions sought for. All re-
ports‘ are taken from‘. "outside the
rooms through tubes that connect the
subjects with instruments in the outer
laboratory and enable the observers
to‘ work under natural conditions.
Such reports as skin temperature,’
body temperature, pulse rate, respi-
ration rate, blood pressure, and the
analysis of expired air are the type of
observation carried on. I

The general problem of the work
is to ﬁnd and chart the conditions of
air that are most’ comfortable. The
American Society of Heating and ‘Ven-
tilating Engineers have an active rep-
resentative in the work and are chie-f-
ly interested in the heating and ven-
tilating information that it furnishes.
The U. S. Public Health Service sup-
plies doctors and subjects and is in-
terested from the" standpoint of
health. The U. S. Bureau of -Mines
at whose laboratory the work is be-
ing conducted have supplied the
space and all material and informa-
tion at their disposal. These three
groups and Dr. Adolf have worked
steadily and are obtaining results in-
creasingly. -

Dr. Herbert M. Moore, president of
Lake Forest U|niversity, Lake Forest,
Ill., honored the University with a
brief visit last Monday. He was
cordially greeted by many of his old
friends, both students. and , faculty
members. Dr. Moore, during the
period of his connection . with Pitt,
directed the Work of the Y. M, C. A.
and was a tremendous “force in the
inﬂuence of student life.
he was called to the presidency of
his Alma Mater, Lake Forest.

Dr. Moore stopped off here on his
way to New York. and was accom-
panied by Mrs. Moore, who will also
be remem'be~red by -many University
people as having done so much for
thestudents -in connection with the
Y. M. C. A. Dr. and Mrs. Moore,
while here, were the guests of Direc-

 

 

tor and Mrs. Charles H‘. Miller. Mrs.-
-Miller entertained in her home on

Schenley Farms Terrace, with an in-
formal tea. for Mrs, Moore on Mon-
day afternoon having as her guests
many! of Mrs. Moore’s former friends
at the University.

Pin Ill-JLPS CHINA
SILK PRODUCTION

The University, through its repre-
sentative, J. Franklin Karcher, ’17,
and the support given him has helped
the Canton Christian College to im-
prove the silk raising condition in
Southern China. ‘

By supporting Karcher the Univer-
sity, has made it possible for the Bi-
ology Department of the Canton
Christian College to work out the im-
portant problem of disease prevention
and eradication. There has been a
prevalence of disease among the silk
wor'ms of Southern China reducing
the production of raw silk to an al-
most unproﬁtable condition. _

The Canton Christian College has
produced a strain of practically dis-
ease-free silk worms and are produc-
ing sheets of eggs from this strain
at the rate of 3,000 per month. Farm-
ers buying these sheets have found
a remarkable improvement in the con-
dition of the silk produced both as to
strength and texture. The college
salesmen ﬁnd as ready market for the
eggs, the farmers being anxious to
pay as much as ﬁve times the market
price. The farmers on the other
hand who buy’ these eggs are. receiv-
ing two to three times the ‘average
market price for their cocoons besides
the relief and minimum labor in
dealing with diseasefree worms.

An intensive practical six months’
course of study, is offered to farmers.’
sons by thecollege to train them to
become better silk worm rearers and
to prepare better eggs for sale. The
college is co-operating with missions
in carrying out this Work and in con-
ducting de-monstration stations where
the illiterate farmer can learn by ob-
servation.

The University will soon have the
opportunity to hear more of this work
on April 4, when Charles K. Edmunds,
president of the Canton Christian
College will speak at a "general as-
semblage on the subject, “Dynamic
China.”

IIEAII MA ANII Pill’

Well folks, I am now in another
semester and altho they didn’t want
me to be here again, I am here. The
man ‘who says whether you can or
cannot do anything with your sub-
jects tells me that I didn’t do good
enough last semester to be allowed
to go again but I showed him up when
I says that if they were fair they
wouldn’t keep me out because the
reason that the “profs” failed me was
because I didn’t believe everything
they told me and that they could not
make a‘ monkey out of me. That’s
what one of them said I was a long
time ‘ago and I ain't going to believe
that my ancestors were them things.
One of them says that by evolution
we come from some little thing like
a worm and became men. Anyhow

I would have to except the statements
of the professors. I told him all right
but you can bet I wont liste-n -to them
if they start any of their old stuif.
Them fraternity boys still have me
to their house as they say" I am good
amusement. I was telling them about
the talk I -had with the advisor and
they all laughed which just goes to
show that they agreed with -me and
de fun of that guy. The girl that
I was telling you about the last cou-

, ple of times is still my best, and I

even took her to a movie the other
evening. She wanted to eat a sundae
but I remembered what you had said
about being extravagant and I says
maybe some night we will go out to-
gether for one of those things.
Besides this there is no news so I

“Lava,” wrote the Freshman,

  "is what you use to shave wit ”,

ND perhaps the Freshman was not so far
wrong at that. He may have been think-.
ing of lather that rolled down his cheeks,

dried on his face, and erupted his feelings in the‘
process.

Today, there is something better-—Williams’
diiiers from any shaving lather you ever used.
For Williams’ Shaving Cream contains a certain
ingredient that is distinctly beneﬁcial to the skin.
And Williams’ is easier to ' '
shave With. It softens
Whisker resistance with a-
speed that‘ takes all the
tcdium out of the shaving
process. Get a tube of
Williams’ today and ‘be-
gin enjoying its helpful
care.

‘ Beginning Monday’ indoor tennis
practice ' will. be "held on the floor
of the Eighteenth ‘-Regiment Armory.
Practice will be held only in the
afternoons,’ and will be limited to
‘the membersof last year’s varsity
and Freshman squads. All others
who desire‘ to practice on the Armory
ﬂoor ,must| communicate with Man-
ager.*Kost at the “Y”. Hut. A‘.regula-
tion court is being laid out, and the
practice should be ‘of great value
to the Panther net men. iWith the
new indoor, facilities, the Panthers
should be in tip-top shape when the
outdoor ‘season opens. ;

Prospects. look bright for a suc-
cessful .season as every veteran of
last.‘ year's squad, and several former
Freshmen tmembers will be;-out for
the team. The team l.e.d byﬁcaptain
O1-iver Pfeifer, former Rochester ath-
lete, will include the following-veterans
of last-yea_r"s.squad: Green, Groomes,
Cooper, Garroway, Martin, Williams
and Linton. Arnold. Silverman, for-
mer._ Baltimore prep school player,
and Ernest Rohrkaste, both of last
iyIear’s star Freshman team, look like
probable varsity men. Dr. T. 
Stephens will again coach the team.’
‘Now that tennis is‘ a major sport, un-
usual interest willno doubt he shown
by "the student -body. '

The schedule is rapidly -being com-
pleted. by Manager . Kost, and looks
to ‘be one of the best that a Pitt
team has had. It will include the
usual trips to- West Virginia, W. & J.
and Allegheny, ‘as well as an Eastern
and a Western ‘jaunt. Home "and

two city high schools lastiweek. On
Tuesday ‘evening the -Cubswon from
Wilkinsburg High School, 55 to ‘ 38.
The game started off in a_. whirlwind
fashion. The Panther Cubs scored‘
nine points before . the Wilkinsburg
team scored a point. Parson scored
ialmost.,_'a.t, will in the first half. Al-
though the Freshmen had a comforta-
ble lead, the _Wi1kinsburg team dis-
played a determined, ‘spirit. The
score at the end. of the ﬁrst quarter
was 11 -to 2 in favor of the Fresh. In
the second quarter “McMillen or
Wilkinsburg sunk -four ﬁeld" goals
from -mid-goal. Together with Dru.-.
vall’s. stead-y foul shooting the Wilk-
insburg‘ team— came within one point
of tying the I score. At this point
Chase go-t into action and put three
through the‘ loop that putﬁthe Cubs
back into the lead. At the half they
were’ leading biyl seven points.- ‘The
second halfwas all Pitt, It was just
a question of the score. In-the sec-
ond _-half Parsons only missed one
foul. - '  T
Two ..nights later Bellevue,High
School‘ was met at Tree-s Gym and
‘easily beaten 44 to. 7. The first quar-
ter of this game was slow and unin-
teresting. The Cubs were decidedly
on color in this frame, butwith’ the
beginning of the second quarter,
things took, on a different aspect.
After the lineup had been juggled
the Freshmen began to score almost
at will.‘ In this game Parson was
moved to a forward, and James was
injected at a guard. This combination
wo-rked well _ ; .

.-Two gamesremain on the s edule.
