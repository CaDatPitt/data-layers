FRIDAY, Nov. 8, 1974

BY KEN GORMLEY
The rise of the average grade at
Pitt from a C to a B in the past 10
or so years was due mainly to a
change-in the faculty’s philosophy
of education, according to CAS

' Dean Robert D. Marshallu

He felt the climb of the average
QPA from under 2.5 to nearly 3.0 in
the last eight or 10 years was the
product of “very complex reasons,”
rather than simply due to the
implementation of the pass-fail
system or the teachers’ fears of

jiunfavorable evaluations, as this

week’s issue of Time Magazine
implied.

“Grades have been going up, and
there are a number of different
causes. But it has to do mainly with
a re-evaluation of education in the
1960’s.” Marshall said during the
60’s_, facultymembers began to get
together to consider the purpose of
evaluations, and there was 4 a

change of attitudes. “I feel many
faculty members changed their
views on grades. Some just wanted
to take the competition related to
grades out of the learning process.
They wanted different kinds of
motivations for students."

As a result, Marshall believed,
“they have tended to give higher
grades since they couldn’t get rid

To Meet at

BYBILLMOORE

Student Government leaders‘
from over 150 Pennsylvania‘col-
leges and universities, including
Pitt. will convene this weekend at
the Penn State main campus to
discuss the formation of a

Pennsylvania Student Lobby (PSL). .

The PSL is an attempt to organize
Pennsylvania students into a
collective force able to exert
inﬂuence on state and federal
legislators and to make them more
responsive to student needs,
according to co-coordinator of the
lobby Rachel Richman. '

A “The largest unrepresented group

in Pennsylvania is the 440,000
students with no voice in Harris-
burg or Washington," Richman
said. “Since students never
squawk to legislators, education is

«u always the patsy. If they want to

cut costs, they cut financial aid."

Representing Pitt will be Student
Government Board member Paul
Hertneky. ‘

“My main goals will be
determine why universities such as
Pitt with a large student body
aren’t given more votes than a
smaller institufion and to establish
whether Pitt is a legitimate
member of the lobby. At present I
don’t think we are as we haven’t

’ given any money,” Hertneky said.

Pitt Student Government Board
president Mike Furick said he is
not attending the conference “due
to a prior committment."

“I hope the PSL gets a -strong core
of students to give us a strong
representation in Harrisburg,"
Furick said. “There are a lot of bills
of interest to students that the
lobby could work towards and this
meeting hopefully will begin the
process."

Richman, a member of the
Chatham College National Student
Association Board, said a 5 year old
California Student Lobby is rated
the 12th most powerful special-
interest lobby in that state.

To SDS, d Other Groups ’ 

BY BRIAN DUNN
The Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), along with ﬁve other
student organizations, lost its
Student Government recognition at

' a ‘Student Government Board

(SGB) meeting Wednesday.‘

Loss of recognition includes loss
of Student Government funding
and of office space on campus.

The groups‘ recognition was
revoked for -failure to maintain a
current file card with the Commit-

‘ tee on Student Organizations

(CSO). According to CSO by—laws
each group must submit a new card

The other‘ groups were: the
Animal Science Club, the Pitt
Chess Club, the Pitt Christian

_ Fellowship, the Students in Social

Science, and the Undergraduate
Math Committee. A

Jane McDowell, a .CSO member,»
said all groups were notified during
the summer about the file card
requirement. After some groups
did not reply, she said, they were
sent a second letter.

“Then last week, we had an
announcement in the Pitt News
that 10 groups still had not filed

Blue-Gold I Award Presented ,

\

The annual Blue Gold Award was
presented to W. Larry Gluck for
outstanding student leadership on
Pitt's campus at the Student-
Alumni Leadership Dinner. Cindy
Hawks, elected Homecoming
Queen Wednesday, was also for-
mally presented at the award
ceremony Thursday evening.

Gluck shook Vice - Chancellor of
Student Affairs Alfred Moye’s
hand as he was handed the award,
.which is presented by the Univer-

sity and alumni to those students

who exemplify a spirit of involve-
ment in matters concerning the
student body.

Finalists for the award include

Michelle DeJean, Buddy Kahan, ‘

Carol Cushman and Mike Furick‘.

. Gluck's activities included volun-

teer work at local hospitals, ar-
rangement of the pre-med student
convention, resident assistant, in-
volvement with thehonarary pre-
med society Alpha Epsilon Delta,
and honarary scholarship society
Phi Eta Sigma.

The Blue-Gold award winner felt
many students were overlooking
leadership roles on campus‘be-
cause of concern overgrades and

professional-school admission.

“A successful leader learns how
to economize his time. It’s possible
to makea hell of a dent in things at
Pitt, and still learn.” ,

ing to Gluck, but this does not

5 Unclergrads Get Internships

BY CONNIE GIEL
Five undergraduates have been
tentatively selected to represent
Pitt ’in the State Government
Internship Program. Sponsored by

"the Pennsylvania Department of

Education, the program will place
the students in several state agen-
cies in Harrisburg for the winter
term. I

Gretchen Pfadt, program campus_

coordinator through the University
Counseling Center, said the state
requested five students from Pitt.
The selection was made from eight
applications, with the final decision
recommending three seniors and
two juniors. The students, Andrea
Topper, Nancy Epperson, Jeff
Leber, Betty Nelson, and Frances
Shaiman, are all currently enrolled
in CA5 studies.

Originally designed in January of
1973 for the 13 state colleges, the
program was expanded this term to
include state-related schools such
as Pitt. The 20 participating
schools .may each submit ﬁve
students. Only 40 of the total 100
may be selected, however. “At
ﬁrst,
placement. Now it's 40, and soon
all of the 100 will go on to
Harrisburg,” Pfadt said.

The state set a November 1

deadline for ﬁnal applications, and‘

Pitt was notiﬁed late in October of
their eligibility for the program.

“We had only enough time to give
it minimal publicity, so very few

people knew about it,” Pfadt said -

“Dr. (Alfred) Moye (Vice Chancel-
lor for Student Affairs) wantedlrto
begin the program by next term,{-so
we’ had to compress the selection
procedure and didn't follow e
exact guidelines as outlined by llie
State." ’

Pfadt explained the selection was
made by a committee of faculty,
staff, and students, who reviewed
the applications and evaluated the
gress.
“Next year we’ll follow a more
extensive selection procedure, with
interviews between the students
and the committee as an integral
part,” Pfadt said.

Selection guidelines are non-
speciﬁc, but Pfadt said the state
expressed a preference for liberal
arts majors because “correlation
has to be seen between the
internship and academics. ’ Pfadt

I: polit-
ical science, economics, journa-
lism, psychology, communications,

"business or public administration,

accounting, and computer science.
Describing the program as “an
innovative approach to education,”

A Pfadt said the main objective is to

enable the students to combine
their interests with an academic
program. The intern must choose
an advisor to design and approve
an academic schedule, with re-
quirements mapped out in blocks of
credits. The schedule can be
worked out after the final Harris-
burg selection, but the students
had to present a tentative idea of
their academic plans in their; orig-
inal application, Pfadt said.

The ‘I6 week program is one week
longer than a regular term at Pitt.’
Participants have to pay tuition
because they receive academic

credit, but they also receive a ‘

weekly stipend of $80 to defray
living expenses in the Capitol. The
state provides assistance in hous-
ing placement, but can’t guarantee
living arrangements.

Participating state agencies in-

   

only 28 were guaranteed-

clude the departments of Public
Welfare, Property and Supplies,
Insurance, PHEAA, the Governor's
Council on Drug and Alcohol
Abuse, the Governor's Council on
Energy, the Milk Marketing Board,
and the Child Development Com-
mittee. Several non-governmental
agencies, such as the AFL-CIO,

PSEA, and the Chamber of Com- .

merce, may be included as the
prografn further expands.

Andrea Topper, a senior majoring
in urban studies and political
science, described her reasons for
applying to the program. “It gives
me the opportunity to integrate
practical experience with the
theory I've learned in class. The
purpose of the internship is not to
see democracy at work, which is a
real fallacy, but to see how policy is
formulated and implemented into
government agencies.” Topper
plans to attend graduate school in
public administration, and feels the
program will “let me learn without
stepping out of one classroom into
another.”

Nancy Epperson, also a senior,
echoed Topperis objectives. “I
want to get an inside look at how a
government agency works and how
it does or doesn’t play a role in
state government decision mak-
ing.” Epperson, a French
Chinese/Womens Studies major,
prefers placement in an education

agency, but
“eliminate ' sexism
agency I get.”

Betty Nelson, a political science
and speech double major, is presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania College
Young Democrats. “I’ve worked in
politics before and I have some
basic knowledge of government,
but I don't know much about it
from an educational standpoint,”
Nelson said. “I want to see the
correlation between a speciﬁc pro-
gram and the problem it’s suppos-
ed to deal with.”

Jeff Leber, an urban studies
major, expressed similar feelings.

“You can read about how govern- 

ment works but you can’t really geT
a good feeling for it unless you
participate in it,” Leber said. “It’s
deﬁnitely a shot in the arm to my
career plans. The experience,
connections, and overall work will
pinpoint my major direction.”

Frances Shaiman, a political
science major, also views the
intemship as a possible career
‘opportunity as well as a learning
experience. “I would like to see
how the agency reacts to. the
legislature on the total state gov-
ernment picture,” Shaiman said.

Marshall : New Philosophy  

(Continued from Page 1')

Marshall, however, emphasized
the fact that a- rise in average
grades doesn’t necessarily mean a
person today who earns an A has
achieved less than a person who
made the same grade a decade
ago. “It’s just that the definition of
achievement is totally different
today.”-He felt to compare these
two measures of achievement was
like “comparing apples and bana-
nas.” \ I

Althdt h a signiﬁcant change in I

faculty- /utlook occurred during the
60's, the Dean pointed out there is
still a segment of the faculty who
believe grades should be a rigorous
afﬁrmation of a student’s ability,
and a means to separate the above
average from the below average
student. They feel it necessary,
said Marshall, to make a clear
distinction for employees and
educational institutions who wish
to make their selections on the
basis of grades.

In some respects, Marshall
agreed faculty members with this
philosophy had legitimate points,
especially in . the case where
students, all with high QPA’s,

submit theirrecords to graduate

schools. ‘

“One of the more unfortunate
boomerangs for those faculty
members who are anti-grades is
that the emphasis of graduate and
professional schools will be more
and more on one-shot aptitude
tests. This may be an unfortunate
consequence.” .

But Marshall felt to label this ﬂaw
a result of sloppiness on the part of
those faculty. members who de-
emphasized grading, was an
“oversimpliﬁcation of a complex
thing.”

Asked whether giving better
grades to students might have
some good effect, such as relieving
pressure from students so that they

 

could actually learn more, Dean

Marshall responded, “Itl1ink every _

faculty member who does this
(places less emphasis on grades)
hopes for this result. It is very
rewarding to know students are
working for something other than
grades.”

Marshall felt it was unfortunate
that there was no concrete way to
demonstrate this increase in
learning is actually occurring along
with the rise in grades.

have to meet

The student leaders will caucus in
separate sessions for state, state-
related, and private colleges‘ and

in our various

universities, and separate sessions I

for junior colleges and technical,

schools to discuss the speciﬁc
problems of those institutions.
Following those meetings the
entire groups will meet again to
hear the proposals of the smaller
groups.

“We will spendthree hours in
these caucuses listing priority
areas and tenatively proposing
by-laws and goals for the Lobby,”
Richman explained, “Then we will
all meet together to approve a
lobby platform, elect a committee
to rewrite the proposal into by-laws
-and elect a 12-member board of
directors for the Lobby.”

ettes had hoped to march at the
Homecoming Game this week.
The original charges were made to
the- Board earlier this week and
were printed in the Pitt News

Kablach said she talked to other

band members Wednesday and

reported they thought the Pnther—
ettes should have a paid profes-

Pantherette Debbie Naylor said
the group has been working with a
former drum major and that “we
can’t prove_ourselves unless we can

She also attacked the band
members for claiming they are the
second best college band in the
nation. “I don't know where they
got their stories, but they definitely

aren’t right. They, said they’re’

number two, but our high school
band was better."

Naylor later said she went to
Steubenville Big Red High School.

SGB President Mike Furick said it
is too late to get the Pantherettes
into the Homecoming show.
“We’re just going to have to get

‘ together with the band again,” he

said. “We’ll keep pushing this and

l~The recent announcement by Student Government President Mike
Furick at~Monday’s Senate Council meeting, that only 10% of the Pitt
facultyzagreed to have their classes surveyed in the Undergraduate
Academic Reyiew last winter term was amazing and regrettable.
 UAR will only succeed in providing registration information to
_s_tudents and evaluating teachers if the maximum number of faculty
members participate. There is obviously a great need to provide
feedback on comses both for teachers and students. And a student
who registers already selects courses without full lmowledge of the
1A 10% showing is incomplete and denies the students the opportunity
o know in advance the course for which they are registering and to
facilitate student needs in structuring an academic schedule.

"" Clearly, the faculty must voluntarily allow their courses in the near
future to be evaluated. The structure of the UAR. still forces a student
o depend on the discretion of the faculty to -have their courses
 aluated. It is apparent because of the minimal number of faculty
'7. who had their courses reviewed that some sort of mechanism must be
 designed to insure that the maximum number of courses are evaluated.
We are certain, however, this is of paramount concern to our Student
""'Govemment leaders, who are currently attempting to reorganize the
course evaluation system. In the meantime, though, we must agree
with Furick that department chairmen must assume leadership roles in
A -prompting faculty members to submit their courses to evaluation. Only
 this way can the best interests of students relative to the issue be
;* Se1'Véd. ‘

One big foul up

Leaderless Sham

BY TOM SMITH

One of the most important events
of Homecoming Week is the
Alumni-Student Leadership Din-
ner. The event held last night
provides an opportunity for stu-
dents to have direct Contact with
Pitt alumni, and is also a recogni-
tion of a student's status as a
leader in the student community. -'
The dinner is funded by the
alumni and the Alumni Office
delegates the responsibility for the
planning of the dinner to the
Student Government Homecoming
Committee. The committee also
delegates the responsibility to a
member of the Homecoming Com-
mittee. This year Michelle\de Jean
was responsible for planning the
dinner, including the composition
of the guest list," This was the first
mistake.

Those ordinarily invited to the
dinner included the leaders of

Student Government (SG). These
consist of the Student Government

. Board (SGB), SG Committee chair-

men, and the SG Allocations Com-
mittee. The total Allocations is
invited because it has no chairman
and is also recognition of the vital,
controversial, ,and thankless hours
spent in the budgeting of student
activites fee money.

This year, however, the Alloca-
tions Committee. which has been
involved in budgetary disputes
with the Homecoming Committee,
was not invited. Not only was this a
tragic oversight, but it was a gross
insult to all the mechanisms of
Student Government. One mem-
ber of the committee was invited

‘but refused to attend‘ in protest of

de_ Jean's arbitrary and unprece-
dented exclusion of the remainder
of the committee.

Certainly, if there are such items
as student leaders the members of
the SG Allocations Committee fit
the classification. It is the most
important committee of Student
Government, and without it the SB
Board and more than 100 student
organizations would not exist. No
group of people in SG works harder
and longer hours than the Alloca-
tions Committee. '

A quite clearly if a decision ‘had to
be made between the SG Board and
the "Allocations ‘Committee, the
majority of SGB,should not have
been invited to the dinner. In fact
the SGB should be ashamed and
insulted thatthey may have oc-
cupied the places of the SGAC.

But, the problem was not the
number of.seats avaialbe for stu-
dents at the dinner. There has
been no decrease from last year,
but rather, according to de Jean,
more students have been invited
this year, only from more diverse
areas of student interest. _

There are no two ways about it.
An alumni-student leadership din-
ner without the Allocations Com-
mittee is a leaderless sham.

The Allocations Committee, how-
ever, was not alone in its exclusion.

According to Chuck Aveni of the

Alumni Office all chairmen of SG
Committees were to be invited to
the dinner. But, neither the
chairmen of the Elections Commit-
tee or the Medical Action Commit-
tee were invited, whereas the
chairman of the Pitt Tenant Union,
a practically defunct SG committee,
was invited. This was Michelle's
second mistake.

Thirdly, for the last two years the
governing officers of the Commuter

T Association have been invited to

the dinner. That was not the case

this year. Only the CA President”;

wasinvited, but he did not even
receive an invitation until six days
before the dinner—past the due

' date foixan RSVP. He also objected

to de Jean's decision and refused to
attend the dinner.

What it all amounts to is one big
foul up. At the same time as these
people were excluded all five
finalists in the Homecoming Queen
contest were invited. All former
winners of the Blue-Gold Award
were invited. The captain of the
cheerleaders and the president of
the Pantherettes were invited. The
chairman and co-chairman of the

_LJ/

Orientation Committee were invit-4-.'~"“*;

ed. (Michelle is also chairman of
the Orientation Committee.\)

Five members of the General
Studies Student Cabinet were in-
vited. And, hilariously, the entire
Homecoming "Committee, 28 in all,
were invited. Apparently, mem-
bership in the Homecoming Com-
mittee automatically categorized
one as a student leader. _

Even though the dinner is over,
and even though it was only a
dinner, it is important to note those
in attendance did not represent an
adequate sampling of Pitt student
leadership. It is also important to
remember that such obnoxious and
basically unfair oversights should
never happen again. Afterall, such
hijinks on the part of de Jean have
only served to mar the true

simply fellowship among alumni
and students——at least for one
night.

(The following Editorial was’ pres-

President and Station Manager,
over .WTAE-TV, Channel 4, from
October 29-November 3, 1974.)

As part of the public (whose tax
money supports the University of
Pittsburgh, we are curiousas to
why Pitt is so negative about the
ROTC. '

Of the nearly 300 uixiversities
which offer Army ROTC programs,
only 13 refuse to give academic
credit for military science courses.

Pitt’s College of Arts and Sciences.

is among them. Why?

This policy heavily penalizes
young men and women who would

like to be part of their country’s _

military reserve. It means they

‘ must carry an academic load which
M will earn them the credits needed

for graduation...plus their." non-

  
 

v And the .

   

ROTC courses are np pushovers.
They -require the same study and
preparation as traditional academic
disciplines.

It appears that some of Pitt’s Arts
and Science faculty have succeeded
in building their anti-military, anti-
establishment philosophies into
university policy. But is it their
institution to run according to their
own tastes?

Those who dislike the military
have every right to avoid it. But
there are still many who believe it
in the national interest to maintain
a reserve officer corps of men and
women from all walks of life.

That is a valid position. We do not
believe the academic card should
be stacked against it. Academic
freedom should not be confined to

attitudes currently fashionable on

the campus. _ I ~.

To the ‘Editor:

On Wednesday, September 25, an
article appeared in the Pitt News
entitled, “Campus Organizations

stated that the College Young
Democrats (CYD) at Pitt have
“about 60 members." Webster’s

I am a fairly active member of this
organization and llknow that last
year we had over 300 members.
Does Ms. Gower [the author of the

pertaining article] believe that CYD
only has 15% of the number of
members we had last year?
Anyone who is familiar with an
organization on campus knows that
it is difficult to ascertain the exact

, amount of members.*This problem

becomes particularly acute when
trying to reach a consensue of the
much used phrase, “members in
good standing.”

Ms. Gower might accurately fell
that the number of people on file at
the ‘CYD office represents an
inﬂated amount. But this ‘is true of
every ‘political organization on

» campus with the ‘possible exception
-of YSA. Ironically, Ms. Gower did
not state a membership figure for

that organization. ,

The reason why these numbers
[eg. CYD having 300 members]
may seem inﬂated is simple. CYD,

These groups’ representation at
state conventions are based on the
amount of members who belong to
each college -chapter. It is only
natural for each group to give the
highest possible ﬁgure to increase
their representation at these
conventions. ‘
However. who is to say what
constitutes a member? Isiit one

4 who attends most meetings and

works hard? I-Iow about one who
attends only a few meetings a
semester - or who only attends
one?‘

Obviously, this whole area is open
to question. What I do not
understand, however, is why the
ﬁgure stated for CR (“82 mem-
bers”) is so inﬂated while CYD’s is
so constricted. This is hardly fair.

Many take what the Pitt News
states as close to’ reality. It ‘is
possible, that Ms. Gower made an
honest mistake.-I do not know why
this has not been investigated. lam
cognizant of the fact that this
matter has been brought to the
attention ofpeople in your office,
yet I have seen no retraction in the
paper. ’ '

Since__this'mistake - and I trust
that is all it was - can be used
unjustly against CYD, I expect that
you will agree with me in stating
that the ﬁgure ‘mentioned was
incorrect.

If you've ever wondered about
that little building right next to the
-“Cathedral facing Forbes Avenue,
wonder no more. It's the Stephen
Foster Memorial, and it has been
sitting there unobtrusively since

_The Memorial houses an audi-
torium mainly used by the Univer-
idy, which will host Cabaret
. hrough its November run. A

' ed Foster lie in the Bigelow Street
— side wing of this miniature cathe-
 ‘Ital. -

,. .‘ For those who might not know,
Stephen Collins Foster, a Pitts-
I ?burgh native, was one of the first
musical composers in the American
, tradition. He wrote songs most of
us take for granted such as “Oh
-’Ij,_Susanna," “Swanee River," and
  “My Old Kentucky Home."

,A visit to the Memorial would

: asked about retirement in the
F -foreseeable future, Hodges chuckl-
- ed and replied, “No, the job keeps

-me outof mischief.”
A Depression days in Indianapolis
j brought Hodges and the Foster
Hall Collection together. He was in

ardent Foster fan and founder of

note."

Before the Memorial opened in
1937, Lilly asked Hodges if he
would like to move to Pittsburgh
and be in charge. Hodges accepted

Foster and knows all that has been
discovered about his life. He has
met several members of Foster’s
family, including Marian Foster
Welch, his daughter, and several
grandchildren and great-grand-
children. He has written two books
about Foster and edited several
others.

Famous visitors to the Memorial
have included Thomas Dewey -and
Hubert Humphrey while he was
vice president of the United States.

The Memorial was conceived in
1927 by women of the Tuesday

Musical Club of Pittsburgh, which

has its offices and holds its
meetings there today. The Univer-
sity offered a site and agreed to
maintain the building and proceed-
ed to contact Lilly. The Pittsburgh
area raised $500,000 with contri-
butions from citizens and even
schoolchildren and ground was
broken for the Memorial in 1935. .

John Bowman, chancellor of the
University at the time, personally

visited Lilly who eventually contri-"

buted his collection to the Memor-
ial. Bowman, in a 1935 article
published in the Atlantic Monthly,
stated the University hoped the
inspirations and aspirations of Fos-
ter would rub off on students.

The University has remained ac-
tive in its interest in the Memorial,
holding various classes and plays
there. The University has publish-
cd several books about Foster.

Songs of Stephen Foster, a paper-
back published by the Press which

contains 44 songs and biographical
notes, is available for $.25 at the
Memorial. Hodges says the de-
mand for these little books is great
and the University loses $1 on each
one, but charges the quarter only
so the books will not be indiscrim-
inately distributed.

The shrine, itself, located in the
Foster wing, is a quaint 12 sided
Gothic style room with high arches
and stained glass windows. The
windows portray some of Foster’s
famous songs. ‘

Glass cases hold the earliest
obtainable copies.of every known
song and composition of Foster’s.
His piano a_nd flute are there.
along with various letters, sket-
ches, and biographical notes writ-
ten about him.

Commemorative stamps and en-
velopes can be seen, as well as the
pocketbook containing $.38 in coins
which was in Foster's pocket at his

death. The purse also contained a
scrap of paper on which was
written Foster's last message to the
world, “dear friends and gentle
hearts."

Foster was born in Lawrenceville
on what is now Penn Avenue on the
Fourth of July, 1826. His family
feared the cannon blasts in cele-
bration of Independence Day who
deafen the infant’s ears; however,
though he lived to be only 37 years
old, he completed over 200 musical
works.

Foster was intensely interested in
blacks and their music, and gen-
erally in the American way of life.
His songs were taken to heart
everywhere. And although both
Yankees and Rebels sang his
songs, his death in 1864 went
almost unnoticed because of the
Civil War.’

Beyond the Veil...ESP at Pitt

BY CHRISTOPHER BREWER
Uri Geller is a stage rnagician
whose act includes demonstrations

I of his purported psychic powers; he

claims the ability to bend metal or
to move objects by ‘his mental
power alone.

In one series of experiments
under Russell Targ and Harold
Puthoff at the Stanford Reserach
Institute (SRI), Geller was placed in
a room sealed from all sensory
input.

Experimenters outside the room,
nearly 475 meters away, selected
random targets drawings which
Geller attempted to reproduce with
pencilled drawings.

Geller missed once or twice, but
when one experimenter selected a
drawing of a bridge, the para-
psychic drew it in abstract. When

one target was presented as _a

portrayed a bunch of grapes inside
the sealed room. ’ ' ‘
In another experiment, Geller
successfully predicted eight se-
perate rolls of dice. The odds were
calculated to be a million in one on
this particular feat. ‘

To parapsychologists, who study -

the stuff of science-fiction—tele_-
pathy, clairvoyance, pyschokinesis,
and extra-sensory perception-
Geller’s talents. -and the finding of
the SRI came as no real surprise.

What is surprising is to find

support for the scientific study of \

psychic phenomenon from presti-
gious scientific journals like
Nature, and academic interest in
’the supernatural at colleges and
universities across the country.
On-a somewhat smaller scale, this
trend was imitated at Pitt with the
development of a new course——Bio-
physics 142 “Survey of Para-

pyscho'logy,"‘ offered for the first
time this winter and taught by
Research Professor Robert Mc-
Connell, active in the ﬁeld since

:1947.

But Biophysics 142 will be scienti-

fically oriented; as a parapyscholo- .

gist, McConnell believes that one
can best understand parapyscho-
logy through scientiﬁc and pyscho-
logical research rather than
through humanistic study. No one

 Va riety is

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

If you were to walk a few blocks
along Fifth Avenue away from
town. you'd eventually come to a
large building which has a vague
resemblance to a local command

{"§:\_\post for SAC, or some other type of
' bomb-proof shelter. Actually, it’s
the building housing WQED-
WQEX television, and WQED-FM

radio. _

WQED-TV started out in what is
today the Pitt Music building. It
was originally intended to broad-
cast school lessons, but its role has
been greatly expanded and so we
have at least one TV station in

 someplace-special-land which
V- -9’ broadcasts some really decent
material. This has included the

dramatization, The Six Wives of-

Henry the Eighth; Alistaire
Cooke’s magnificent, fascinating,
and unvarnished history of our
country, Alistaire Cooke’s Amer-
ica; as well as a number of first rate

‘theatrical productions, an unbe-‘

lievable "scattering of shows de-
signed for information purposes as
well as entertainment and a num-
ber of televised orchestral produc-
tions.
WQED-FM offers a lot more in
the way of music, which is only
 right. since TV sound is terrible,
and channel 13 sounds a bit more
like TV in this respect than most of
the other local channels. On the
other hand, FM is a great medium
for transmitting a signal with as
little loss of ﬁdelity as possible.
There is a large variety of music
represented on WQED-FM, with
the accent on the unusual. and
seldom-played gem. Every week-
day morning at 9:05, Karl Haas's

  Musical Appreciation A

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER L ~ - 
Every once in a while, when they don't have anything else to write 7'3
about, orchestral music writers take a little time 39 bemoan the_fact that I 
the type of music they like isn't the type of music which most people,._5__.
like. Usually. they end up about as puzzled about the whole business as '
when they started. I 3:}
Actually, I suspect if the orchestral music devotee could look at th ”
situation objectively, he would be able to see‘some very sound reasons
why orchestral music isn’t as popular as it could be, and not all of these -
reasons are cause for pr_ide. I _' i — 
To begin with, the entire concert hall scene is so formal that the .7’
average person, unless he has learned to be comfortable in a concert 
hall from a young age, feels like a fish out of water. ‘For openersfi
there's the orchestra -- around a hundred men and women taking their ,"
positions on stage, preparing to expend as much energy as trained ;
athletes during the next hour and a half... and dressed informal attire. "
And although the black pantsuit has broken into organizations, such as V
the Butler Symphony Orchestra, all- women in the Pittsburgh!‘ ;_
organization‘ still wear the ungainly flog length black skirt. 
Also, the average concertgoer is dressed to the hilt. Yes you will even 
see real-lite tormal wear on many at the patrons, as well as the;
performers. There are no dress codes, so far as I know, at Heinz Hall, 
but if you're not dressed up yourself, you're liable to feel mighty 
uncomfortable. - _' _
What really drives young listeners away in droves, however, is the
damned humorless, dry atmosphere. of the concert hall. Quite a few of 
the masterpieces of Western music --Beethoven’s Eighth Symphoniy,_'i_
for example -- are at least partly intended to be humorous‘. 
However, just let loose with one snicker, and persons in nearby seats
stare at you as if you've taken leave of your senses! Of course. itis
imperative that every single note be clearly heard, so if you move in;
your seat to get more comfortable, making a squeak, the result is:
almost always a couple of dirty looks -- God help you if you cough?
during ‘a quiet passage! 
In the concert hall, Calvinistic thought is still definitely in control. The - 

may have about the music strictly to himself. If you read the program 
notes, you immediately discover theponcert hall isn't entirely a place '

You get your cheat sheet ahead of time, and then are expected to:
concentrate on the piece being played, watch for those “key '
passages,” etc. It is, I am certain, quite acceptableto enjoy a concert;
but I’m not at all convinced it is considered proper to “have fun”-"'
listening to a concert. How many times has anyone ever described an .
orchestral concert as fun?

Leonard Bernstein tried to make some changes in this area. and. 
Arthur Fiedler is quietly doing more of the same sort of thing. As a“
result, more people are learning that orchestral music can really be __
fun. However, just as sure as Pete won't fix those damned trolley___
tracks on Fifth Avenue, or anywhere else.— it'll be quite a few seasons V"
before a real spirit of relaxed informality is able to break into thef-
concert hall of any major_city orchestra. .

And until this happens, I don't see how we can expect the person not 7
raised on orchestral music to develop a taste for it at some later time.
And that is a shame. because a lot of people are missing a lot as a”
result. - P"

pulled out the correct amount, none
too much or little, of Shaw’s
humor. Never losing touch of his
satire, never twisting his script, but
instilling her actors with the best of
Shaw’s written possibilities,
George creates a delightful even-
ing. '

The play’s plot is a traveling
mixture of love. fantasies and
mocked war, the creation‘ of char‘-
acters ‘that encourages the aud-
ience to laugh at both concepts.
Captain Bluntschli, 'a Swiss pro-
fessional soldier ﬁghting for Serbia
against Bulgaria, finds himself in
the bedroom of lovely Raina while
trying to escape from Bulgarian
soldiers. Petty Raina is not just

.lovely but also the daughter of a
Bulgarian major and the fiancee of
Sergius, also a Bulgarian major. It
seems Blutschli is likeable enough
that R_aina and her mother keep
him in hiding for the evening.

Bluntschli takes off but because of

an air of love between Raina and
himself; he returns after the war,
but oh-oh, it’s the same day that
Sergius and Raina’s father "come
home. The plot complications are
complicated and so goes the com-
plicated drama...reminiscent of a
well-made-play.

There’s an air of Shakespeare’s
Taming of the Shrew throughout

the play...the smooth mixture of»

war and love, the battling image of
a love game, the ampliﬁcation of
stomping, loud powerful charac-
ters. No, there’s not Shakes-
peare’s powerful images and
deeper multi-level characteriza-
tions, instead there’s Shaw’s de-
lightful humor and pleasant satire.

The production is in Carlow’s
Kresge Theatre, a theatre built
without theatre thought...two

exits, a permanent, fancy but

worthless backstage, 3 times wider
than deep and not a bit of overhead

working room. It's this stage that

makes the success of the produc-
tion all the more amazing. George
has capably and fully used the
awkward space." The actors never

consciously projected their attempt .

at full stage movement, the move-
ments were comfortable, permitt-
ing one never to awkwardly realize
that the actors’ movements were
basically lateral.

Credit is also due to the cast for
overcoming the stage and technical
limitations. Using ,varied —and
amplified voice and movement
mixed with excellently timed dry-
ness, the cast played tight, com-
fortably...the timing on the lines
was excellent. There was that
audience-capturing extra, the re-
freshing - addition of projected
energy on the part of the whole
cast...Catherine Robinson as
,Raina, Patricia -McCarten as the

mother, Carol Solomon as Louka,_

soccer coach Leo Bemis. “Last
year Indiana shut us out, and we

about it, we will be ready to play.”

Bemis will make no drastic lineup

is undecided over whether John
Wallace or Nick Chrisanthon will

is pleased with the progress his
team has made since the beginning
of the season, and especially in the
loss against West Virginia and the
last two wins against Grove City

Tomorrow's game between the
Owls of Temple University and the
Pitt Panthers is shaping up as more
than just a football game. It is a

- contest between the fourth ranked .
team in the East and‘ the second

rankedteam. The Owls have much
to prove this week as they attempt
to show everyone their 6-1 record
hasn't been achieved simply be-
cause they play a weak scheudle.

The Panthers have somewhat
more at stake, a Sun Bowl bid and a

good shot at the Lambert Trophy.

And they can also make the people

at the Cotton Bowl chew their nails
in anticipation of Pitt’s Thanksgiv-
ing Day game against Penn State.

Needless to say, they may be a
little embarassed if they have to
present the East’s second best

team on New Year’s Day.

Tomorrow’s game will be the ﬁrst
of a three game set for the Panthers
which will determine just how
much ‘they have improved over the

“We have it_ more -together now,”
Bemis explains. “At this point we

are playing up to our potential. If

we can beat Indiana we’ll be high
for Penn State, and it will take a
snowstorm to slow us down.“
While Bemis is at least content
with his team's performance so far,
Celtnaiks presents an oppsoing
viewpoint concerning his own
team. Three four’s would be great
if Cetnaiks were playing poker, but
since they represent wins, losses,
and ties, he is less than satisﬁed.
“No, I can’t really say that I’m
satisﬁed with our record," ’ says
Celtnaiks. “I feel that we should
.have won the games we tied
against Shippensburg, Grove City,
and Behrend. We’ve been playing
the best soccer we’ve played in -six
years, but we could be winning
more. But regardless, I sure hope
we’re ready to play Pitt. We make
a lot of noise at the beginning of the
game, but all those rah-rahs are
sometimes deceiving. A I’m not
expecting an easy game.”

They consistently dominated thei

scores. However, against the*two;_
top teams on their schedule, th,
Owls are only 1-1. ‘ If

Halfback Henry Hynoski and Bo

with their tough running ability...
Hynoski is the team’s leading
rusher with 629 yards on — 126

done a great job of clogging up the
middle with his big size (6-3, 262)_i

The defensive secondary is very
quick and can easily get back to:
cover the pass or move up to help’.-.
out on the run. The linebackers run:

iVenanzi Keeps Bo0tersTogether

And it is this year’s group of '

booters, who can’t brag of an
outstanding superstar, that have
already bettered last year’s marks,
currently toting a 4-4-2 card into
Saturday's clash with IUP.

This year the key words have been
team work, cohesiveness and
togetherness. Forget the superstar
and insert one “free spirit" as
assistant coach Joe Luxbacher
prefers to refer to fullback Mark
“Chet" Venanzi.

It's been the ability of the Pitt

‘ soccer team to pull itself together

and play as a unit that has
produced the .500 mark to date.
and it's been Venanzi who's taken
the leadership role. A senior
tri-captain from Monongahela,
Chet has paid his dues over the
past two years and now has been

.. given the opportunity to start for

Bemis.

In his sophomore year, Bemis
kept Venanzi a substitute behind
older, more experienced wingers.
Last year, he was moved back‘ to
the defense, but still could not
crack the starting lineup with any
amount of regularity, since Bemis
had another set of veteran

' fullbacks.

After two years of frustrations,
Venanzi has come to the front to
provide the team with morale
guidance only experience could
provide.

"At the beginning of the season

we weren't together." Chester
said. “We were beaten at Bucknell
and then blown out here by West
Chester, 7-1. It was after that 7-1’
game we realized our attitudes
were like a bunch of guys in a
pickup game of hoops."

That realization was the admis-
sion that without the talents of a
star, the only way to win was team
play. Venanzi, who leads the team
in calesthenics in the absence of
coach Luxbacher, emphasized that
this year’s team is by far Bemis’
most cohesive unit of several years.

“We're a together bunch of
guys," Chet remarked. “We keep
in contact off the ﬁeld, partyra lot
and just know each other better. It
used to be a couple of years ago,
once you left the practice you just

"forgot about your teammates and

kept to your own business."
According to Luxbacher, Venanzi

is the integral factor in keeping the

team's morale together. And in a

/town where soccer is ignored and at

a university where football reigns
supreme, it takes a special attitude
to accomplish the task.

“Chet is a loose kind of guy,”
Luxbacher said. “He’s just that
type of person that doesn’t let too
many things bring him down. He
keeps the team loose and in the
right frame of mind as much as he
can.”

With the breaks Pitt has been
getting throughout Venanzi’s four

that will face IUP Saturday.

years, keeping a straight head"
toward the ‘game can be rough.
Three quick goals by West Chester
that shouldn’t have been (one a 45
foot head shot), a 3-2 loss to
powerful Temple when Pitt out-
played the Owls, and ties with
Edinboro and Slippery Rock are
just a few on this year's list.

“The Temple game proved we can
play with the best teams around,
even though we lost," Venanzi
said. “We're a team of local guys
but we can play with any of our
opponents. Pitt doesn’t go out and
recruit like the big soccer powers.

“Gamesaver” Hodge GiV.esiDefense 

BY ANDY BEHREND

If Glenn Hodge is reincarnated,
he may very well come back as a
Gamesaver, the machine that sucks
up water from the Tartan turf at
Three Rivers Stadium.

For that’s the newly acquired
reputation handed to Hodge fol-
lowing his stellar performance in
Syracuse last Saturday. His two
clutch interceptions salvaged Pitt’s

(Continued from*Page 10) ‘

Coach Bemis just doesn’t have the
budget.

-“Pitt gets most of their soccer
‘players on recommendations from
high school coaches,” Chet contin-
ued. “Coach Bemis will get a letter
from a coach who has a guy that

 wants to play at Pitt and then invite

him up and check him out.”
That's exactly how Venanzi made
the trip up the Mon river after
playing basketball, soccer
running hurdles in high school. He
is the prime example of the local

‘ talent, which, by the way, is up and

coming in college soccer.

Venanzi’s overall versatility is the
common mark of what the local and
state high school players must
exhibit in order to make the college
caliber. It’s also the aspect that
Bemis considered when he moved
Chet to the back lines.

For Venanzi, two years of
frustrations are water over the
dam. His head's together and so is
the Pitt soccer team.

fourth straight win, and more
importantly added to the whole
defensive secondary a confidence
needed to overcome the darts this
week’s quarterback, Steve Joachim
of Temple, will be ﬁring.

Hodge merely shrugged off the
adulation tnrown his way as “being
in the right place at the right
time." But then, the 6'1”, 175
pound native from Youngstown,
Ohio has shown up all yeariiat the
right time. p’

“I’d have to say I’m happy with
my season so far,” Hodge said,
adding, “The Syracuse game was

"my best of the season.” .

Admittedly, Hodge has come into

i his own under the Majors era. For

two years under>Carl DePasqua he
found himself doing little. . With
the transition in coaches, people
found Hodge strengthened a pre-
viously riddled secondary.

“Coach Majors has given me a lot
of conﬁdence in myself these past
two years,” Hodge said. “And our
defensive backﬁeld coach, Joe
Madden, has helped me tremen-
dously with my techniques.”

Hodge adheres to what he calls

“The Lem Barney style" of play as
a defensive back. Barney, a
professional with the Detroit Lions,
has said playing in the secondary
requires 90% application and 10%
natural ability. '
' The statistics prove Hodge is
combining both of these crucial
points. From his left defensive
halfback position, he leads the
entire secondary in tackles with 37
(fourth highest on the club) and has
assisted on 25 other hits.

This Saturday, Hodge and his
mates in the backﬁeld, Denny
Moorhead and David Spates, both
of whom have played solidly all
season, will have their hands full
with the plethora of Temple’s
strong receivers.

Jeff Stemple, a Pitt “almoster”
and Pete’Righi lead the receiving
corps, of which Hodge says,
“They’re aggressive and concen-
trate very well on coming back to
the ball. They don’t have the speed
of a Marshall Mills (West Virginia),
but they make up for it in these
other areas." ‘

In Joachim, Pitt isup against the

 

total offense leader in the nation.
The Temple offense itself has
amassed a ludicrous 43 points per
game, but in their last two games
the Owls have been held to only 21
and 20 points.

The Panther defense has given up
only 12.5 PPG, if you discount the
North Carolina ﬁasco. Hodge feels

potent as Temple’s, offers no extra
