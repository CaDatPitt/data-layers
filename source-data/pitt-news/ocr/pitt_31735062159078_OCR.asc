Interpretation Of New,
Former Official Seals
Of University Offered

By MILDRED AKSELRAD

Design of the University seal
has been changed so often that
every few years, students in-
quire, “\Vh-at does it mean?”

By traditional symbolism, this
emblem represents the estab-
lishment of the University in
this city when there was not
much else here in cultural "devel-
opment. Symb-olized A by "four
wavy lines, the Monongahela and
Allegheny rivers join to form the
larger Ohio "represented by five
lines.

University Light

At the junction of the symbo-
lized rivers, the light or a candle
flames, I signifying knowledge,
truth, and youth. ‘ The candle is
the University.

Previously used from 1908 to
1937, the old seal was designed by
Dr. W. J. Holland, ex-Chancellor
of the University. It consisted of
five circles, one inside of the other.
In the middle of the ﬁrst circle
was the ofﬁcial seal of the city of
Pittsburgh.

The armorial bearings of the
Chatham family, (Fort Pitt hav-
ing been originally named for the
Earl of Chatham) was made the
basis of our city seal and conse-
quently of our University seal.

The castellated wall, which
means in heraldic language, “City
of Pitt,” was substituted for the
crest of the Chatham arms. On
the arms are three circles repre-
senting bezants, or coins of Byzan-
tium or Constantinople and no
doubt perpetuating the heroism of
some member of the family during
the crusades.

Chetliem Basis

F Abovedthe Chatham emblem, in
consecutive circle are the words:
Piiisbiijrsh Aeeeem» 1737; the
Uuiyersity of Pennsylvania. 1819;
add in the last circle, Seal of the
University of Pittsburgh, 1908.

Beneath the Chatham seal, in
conse,cutive arcs," are: the Latin
motto,  ct V,i!.'l_i1lS. OI‘ Truth
and‘ Manhood; thirteen stars rep-
resenting the thirteen States which
composed the Federal Union in
1787; an oak leaf; and a curved
row of palms, these latter two be-
ing civic emblems.

Dr. Holland, in speaking of this
seal, had said, “. . .and I hope that
the "Board wi11, if -not adopting the
device I have prepared, neverthe-
less select one which possess 1n-
herent dignity andswhich embod-
ies a reference to the corporate
life of the institution of which we
ought to be proud.”

From All Schools

To Feature Book

Mathematically, The 1938
Owl goes to bat with two strikes’
on it.

So it seems, when the first
lady of The Owl, editor Idella
Rome, takes time out from the
yearbook’s undergraduate sub-
scription campaign to make the
statementthat this year’s book
will cost about $7.50 to put out
.  but ‘will be
available to. siti-
dohé for only
$3.50.

This leaves a
deﬁcit of $4.00
per book which
only Miss
Rome’s subtle
way of telling
us that the Owl
this year will

is

  

Idella B91116 new features
from front cover to last page.

Editor Rome believes that the
completed yearbook will for the
first time have recorded the story
of every University school includ-
ing the Schools of Medicine, Den-
tistry, and Pharmacy, in addition
to the College, School of Business
Administration, Engineering and
Mines and Education.

A photomontage on exhibition
on the ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral, which, done in two colors,
will form the end sheets for the
yearbook, is a glimpse into the
photographic beauty of the book.
Discussing the Owl’s candid pic-
tures. Miss Rome says, “The idea
' for the candid
camera sections
of the Owl is
entirely anew
idea in college
yearbooks. And
we have a tech-
nique "O of pic-
ture - 1; akin g

Finance Professor

Writes On Savings

 Dr.Amos’ Book °
Explains Federal

, Profits Taxation

The Federal undistributed‘
proﬁts tax is unsound in its
present form but the extent to
which corporations» reinvested
proﬁts during the 1920’s was
far more than was generally
conceded, Dr. J. Ellwood Amos,
assistant professor of ﬁnance,
says in his recently published
book entitled “The Economics of
Corporate Savings.”

Dr. Amos declares that a fallacy
in determining undistributed prof-
its has been the use of ﬁgures.
from income tax reports. He ex-
plains that this is caused by the
discrepancy between the reports
given to stockholders and those
given after permitted deductions
are made for tax purposes.

Some of the more important
conclusions reached by Dr. Amos’
book are (1) that a relatively
small part of the undistributed
proﬁts of the 1922-1929 period was
paid out in cash dividends to indi-
vidual stockholders after 1929; and
it is probable that even if the tax
remains in the statutes, corporate
management will ﬁnd means of
saving large portions of proﬁts.

The author stated that since un-
distribusef. profits have only re-
cently b-:-en given special consid-
eration in economic theory, a
theory has not been formulated.

Dr. Amos has been at the Uni-
versity since 1928, coming from
the University of Illinois at that
time. He was graduated from Col-
orado college and took graduate
work at the University of Illinois.

Chicago Pastor

Discusses Way
To Good Living

Dr. Horton Stresses
Need Of Love, Books
For Successful Life

“Don’t just be good-be
good for something,” Dr.
Douglas Horton, pastor of the
United church of Hyde Park,
Chicago, advised University
students, in his speech at the
special assembly VVednesday in
Stephen Foster Memorial.

Discussing “New Meanings
for Life,” Dr. Horton declared,
“Living is futile when one battles

‘ without charge, makes a journey

without a book, or lives without
love.” .

Dr. Horton suggested three
means of learning the art of liv-
ing. The only way to “successful
living,” he said, “is through con-
secration of mind and soul. His
suggestions were:

1. Going through life’s battle
with a deﬁnite drive is necessary
to obtain a goal above mediocrity.

2. During all our spare time,
we should take a book under our
arms, constantly maintaining an
intellectual -thirst.

3. “True love makes us what
we are; we will grow in the di-
rection in which we love.”

Dr. Horton spoke at a reception
sponsored by the advisory board
of YM-YWCA held Wednesday at
3':30 o’clock in the faculty lounge,
seventeenth floor of the Cathedral.

Discussing “New Selves,” Dr.
Horton led a joint Y Association
Night seminar yesterday at the Y
club rooms, Forbes and Bouquet
streets.

Pitkin Club will hear Dr. Hor-
ton discuss “New Motives,” _at a
meeting today at 1:30 o’clock, at
the Shadyside Presbyterian church,
Amberson avenue.

Terminating Religious Emphasis
week, an open forum will follow
the Skeptic’s Club meeting, at 3:30
o’clock in 132 Cathedral.

Panhellenic Council Publishes
Handbook For Freshman Class

' Who’s Who in Women’s Frater-
nities at Pitt,” the new Panhellenic
handbook which this year replaces
“O Philos,” will be ready for dis-
tribution this morning, according
to Olive Brown, Ed38, editor of
the handbook.

The new book, which will be
given to freshman women in their
unit meetings by Panhellenic rep-
resentatives, has a red cover with

structions for marking the new
ballot for bidding under the re-
cently-adopted quota plan are also
included.

Last year’s listing of fraternities
and fraternity members, together
with drawings of each group’s
pin, is augmented this year by a
statement of the colors of the fra-
ternity, the dates of national and
local founding, and the names of

Formal Banquet
For New Tappees

Initiation of  members and
associates, including two un-
dergraduates, to Sigma. Xi, na-
tional honorary scientiﬁc fra-
ternity, will be conducted next
\Vednesday, announces Dr.
George M. McKinley, instructor
in biology and secretary of the
organization.

At ceremonies in the University
Club, beginning at 5:45 o’clock,
seven members and 18 associates
will be initiated. Herbert Rack-
off, C38,’ and s. Frederick Kapa,
C38, are the undergraduates to be
honored with associate member-
ship.

Members of the organization
will be host to the new tappees
and guests at the annual formal

banquet at 6:30 p. m. The ban-,

quet will be followed at 8 o’clock,
by an illustrated lecture by Dr.
H. T. Davis, professor of mathe-
matics at Northwestern university,
on “The Problem of Times Series.”

The lecture is open to those who
may be unable to attend the ban-
quet. Sigma Xi invites particu-
larly members of the faculty of
the School of Business Adminis-
tration and the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research to attend.

Dr. Davis is an outstanding au-
thority on time series problems
and has published widely in the
ﬁeld of business statistics. At the
Pittsburgh meeting of the Amer-
ican Association for the Advance-
ment of Science three years ago,
Dr. Davis predicted the present
recession with remarkable accur-
acy; his lecture Wednesday will
include comment on the outlook
for the future.

orary fraternity are: Nathan Ber-
man, VVilliam E. Brinker, Dr. Ed-
na Higbee, Dr. W. W. Maclachlan,

CA ‘Cabinet Plans

Informal Evening Dance

Enough for this week-end!
Let’s start planning for a bigger
and better time next Friday nite
when the College Association
holds their only dance this
semester. Chaik up February
25 in your date books, and re-
serve your favorite corner in
the Schenley ballroom.

These are just suggestions of
the plans being laid by Presi-
dent Ted Whitaker, C38, and his
CA cabinet for your entertain-
ment.

In addition, the committee has
signed up Ches Walters and his
band to play for the dance.
Even if you never heard of Ches
Walters, they say (those who

_ know) that he is a very much
all right.

Incidentally, you might want
to know that tickets may be ex-
changed for one dollar at the
ofﬁces of the dean of men or the
College. And if they haven’t
already told you, the members

_A of the cabinet are selling them
too.

Twenty-three
department of ﬁne arts are sub-

mitting decorative panels to be‘

used as decoration at the annual
Night in Poland ball to be held in
Syria Mosque on Wednesday. At
the ball, the panels will be judged
by the members of the Kosciuszko
Foundation as a basis of award-
ing a scholarship for six weeks of
study in Poland.

The work on the panels is pro-
gressing rapidly under the direc-
tion of Philip C. Elliott, assistant
professor of ﬁne arts. Much of
the work portrays the native
dances of Poland, featuring the
Polonaise, the Polish equivalent
of the Virginia Reel.

The panels are being made of
cut colored paper and are to em-
phasize that “life is gay in P0-

students of thev*

Iland.” The panel adjudged the
most original‘ will win the schol-
arship for its creator. The schol-
arship will include study under
three Polish craftsmen, in paint-
ing, ceramics, and sculpture, and
also a travel tour of Poland.
Monetary value of the ward is
$750. —

The Kosciuszko Foundation is
an organization which seeks to
cement cultural relationship be-
tween Poland and the United

Player, Playing Style
Given Credit

By Leonard Leoison

Among the things that seem to have evaded the straight
news-reproduction in the several weeks just gone by are some
rather commendable features that tend to account for the ac-
tions and reactions of several Pitt teams.

=l< >l=

>16

>l< =21

One Star—As the Carlson eliminat'ors have passed through
the better portion of their ﬂoor schedule, they have vacillated

from one extreme of the median¢
plane to the other. The result is

that their record, in toto, doesn’t
quite reach the Druid quality point
average of 125.

Which way the remaining half-
dozen games go, quite naturally,
will determine their semester’s
standing.

Through all this season of win
and loss, and of shifting playing
style, there has been one steadily

brilliant basketball sniper on the

Panther team. The reference of
course, is to Myles Zeleznik, senior
forward.

When the Panthers played their
ﬁrst ﬁve games away, the only
word the homefolks had about the
team was that brought back by
the wire services, and with more
intimacy, by the players, them-
selves. At that time, the boys had
nothing but words of praise for
the play of forward Zeleznik, who
at that early moment was per-
forming in the most capable man-
ner

Quarterback

This was all said, despite the
fact that Zeleznik was among the
lower decks in scoring totals.

Since then his play has re-
mained on the same, consistently
high plane. And, in addition, he
has worked up a fatter scoring
ﬁgure.

However, it is not in the actual
scoring itself, but in making scor-
ing possible that Zeleznik excels.
There is a certain uncanniness in
the way he: ﬂips passes into per-
fect scoring positions for one of
his playmates.

“Zilch” is the team quarterback.
He directs the ‘ball up the ﬂoor
into offensive territory and then
continues to direct the floor of-
fense.

Breaking up scoring plays by
pass interception has been one of
his frequent defensive gestures.
He’s at his best when working the
man-to-man defense. Last Satur-
day, he was the man who kept his
arms in front of S01 Meihoff all
evening. After the game, Meihoﬁ.’
told Coach Lawther, “It wasn’t
that I had an off-night that I
couldn’t push them through the
hoop. It was because Zeleznik
was tagging me so thoroughly that
I didn’t have a chance to take a

decent shot.”
‘-3

Hockey Play

Defense —- In starting out, the
McSorley marauders lost their ﬁrst
two games. Since then they have
come through with ﬁve consecu-
tive victories. This complexion
change may be attributed to a
time-worn Pershing adage, “A
good defense is the best offense.”

Close body checking has become
the defense order for the skate-
men. They employ what may be
designated as a man-to-man de-
fense, emphasized by the two spe-
ciﬁcally-indicated defense men.

How well this works in an of-
fensive way was very aptly illus-
trated in Cleveland one week ago
when the Fenn, team, guarded so
closely, put through two scores
into their own nets.

This man-to-man type of play
has somewhat relieved goalie Bud
Ellis, who, despite inexperience,
has been holding up the nets with
eclat.

It also puts a death to such a
remark as the one that emanated
from a Cleveland wag after the
John Carroll game in which Ellis
was injured and Carroll won, 3-0.
The wit was, “What the Panther
icers need is a goal-berg.”

Q C

Boxers After Revenge
Against Catholic U.

Coach Jack Schricker, with the most talented glove team in
Pitt boxing history, will entrain tonight for VVashington, D. C.,
where the Panther punchers will taper off against Catholic
University ’s classy ﬁsticuﬁers Saturday evening.

The Blue and Gold boxing banner has been hoisted high in
every session this season, even when the locals were losing. \Vest

Virginia, Wash-Jeff, and Temple¢

received a pretty thorough go-
ing-over from the Pitt ringmen,
while the mighty maulers of Syra-
cuse barely outpointed the
Schricker athletes.

Tomorrow night’s match, with
Catholic U., and Penn State, Feb-
ruary 24, and Bucknell, March
12, round out this year’s sched-
ule, and there is strong indica-
tion that the Panther pokers will
humble their three remaining op-
ponents. Coach Schricker, a
chronic worrier, has little reason
to fret this campaign. _

DORAND VVINS
115—pound champion, Ralph
Dorand, has won every fight, and
seems headed for national honors.
Little Johnny Wargo, 125 pounds,
has performed in a like manner.
Wargo carried an amazing load of

dynamite in both hands.

Captain Ralph Caruso, who
strips in the 135-pound class, in-
augurated the season with a spec-
tacular knockout, but bowed to
his next two challengers. Caruso
is expected to hit his true form,
though, tomorrow evening, for
Coach Schricker has been using
the Whip in practice every after-
noon this week. No dry jersies
were turned in for five days.

Jed Curzi, l45—pounder, Ray
Bombe, 155, and Ashmann, in the
165 division, started slow and now
have reached their respective
peaks, which has eased the Pan-
ther tutor’s worries in that direc-
tion. '

WEAK POSITIONS

The light-heavyweight and
heavyweight spots are a little
weaker than any of the other po-
sitions. George Lupinnacci, 175,
although he has managed to hold
his own, has not been in the best
condition. He is reported ready
for the Catholic battle. ‘

No one has been appointed the
regular heavyweight to date.
Footballer Ted Schmidt and Bill
Hickmann have spent most of the
winter tossing punches at each

other for the assignment, with
neither one giving ground.
Pitt’s freshman fighters will

meet the East Liberty stable to-
night, for their initial match. With
the exceptions of Speigal, 125, and
Spence, 145, the yearlings are a
none too promising lot.

They call it basketball!

It looks like basketball, but
is rough enough to be hockey
or football and features stars
of the gridiron. This little rid-
dle describes Interfraternity
basketball as it was played last
Tuesday and Wednesday on Trees’
and the Stadium boards.

Of the thirteen fraternities, six
still boast clear slates, Phi Kappa,
Theta Chi, PiKA, Kappa Sigma,
SAE, and the Pi Lams.

Theta Chi, in taking its second
straight, put on a‘ grand show of
pushing and shoving with the Phi
Delts and won going away at 34-
26.

Frank Patrick has a very potent
SAE quintet built around him and
in no uncertain terms made it
known they are out for the title.
Patrick piled up 16 points to help
his mates take Phi Delt and on
Wednesday evening took the Sam-
mies with plenty of steam under
wraps.

PiKA in two starts really looks
like the breadwinner in League A.
With the ex-fresh-reg‘ular Dick
Davies at a forward, PiKA very
neatly blew the Phi Eps sky high
with a 505-9 blast.

At the same time PiKA was
storming Phi Ep, the Phi Kaps,
pre-season favorites, had to do an
about—face to outscore a stubborn
Phi Gam ﬁve.

After looking at the scoreboard
from the short end for three quar-
ters of the game, the Craig Street
boys turned on the steam. And
with Johnny Urban and Dick Cas-
siano_ dumping them in came up
from 15-19 to take the decision.

WEDNESDAYS SCORES

Theta Chi 34, Phi Delt 26.

Lambda Chi 26, Delts 18.

Kappa Sig 2, Sigma Chi 0.

PiKA 50, Phi Ep 9.

Duquesne, Wednesday, February:
23, and Carnegie Tech, Saturday,
February 26.

Temple and Georgetown present
serious hurdles for the Blue and
Gold's Conference championship
ambition. Pitt must top both of
these classy cage squads in order
to remain as a title threat.

Tonight’s and Saturday’s games
are return meetings for Pitt, on the
home and home basis; the Owls
and Hoyas having played the ﬁrst
of their season’s series with the
locals in the Stadium.

Georgetown and Temple are the
only members of the Eastern Con-
ference with victories, both by
narrow margins, over the Carlson
quint.

SET FOR CROWN

The Templars are all set to glide
in for their very ﬁrst Eastern
crown. Their record is hard to
beat. The Usilton basketballers
have recorded wins over West Vir-
ginia, Carnegie Tech, Georgetown,
Penn State, and Pitt——eight tri-
umphs and one defeat.

If the Owls are successful this
evening the Conference laurels are
automatically theirs. But if the
Oaklanders should even their score
with the Temple giants, and go on
to humble the Hoyas, and also
subdue their remaining Eastern
foes, which is more than just pos-
sible, Pitt and Temple will be in
the same position as they were last
year. An Eastern Conference
play-off will be necessary.

TEMPLE TOUGH

Temple, even from this distance,
and especially at this time, looks
just a little too tough for the un-
dependable Panther. In their ini-
tial clash with the Carlsonmen the
Owls, although they had been on
the road for several days prior to
the Pitt whistle, and were visibly
tired, exhibited some exceptionally
neat ball handling, an almost im-
pregnable defense, and several
hard-to-check scoring artists.

Coach Jimmy Usilton will call
upon the same experienced ﬁve
that has been bowling over all
corners with admirable consiste-
cy—Black, Shields, Bloom, Hen-
derson, and Boyle.

Dr. Carlson will start his seni-
ors, Captain Johnson, Zeleznik,

A squad of seven Panther track
men will make the New York trip
to mingle in Madison Square Gar-
den with the country’s crack track 
artists at the New York A. C.‘
meet tomorrow.

Olson does not expect a par-
ticularly good showing from the
Panther contingent. The track
team is about a month behind in
training and is hampered by a
slight epidemic of colds. During
the week Olson had asked to be
released from his committment to
make the Manhattan trip but the
publicity had already been re-
leased and arrangements made.
The A. C. meet will be the mile
relay team’s second race against
the speediest quartets in the coun-
try. Baton-wieldrs from Man-
hattan, Georgetown, and Holy
Cross will run against the Pitt
four. Sophomores Al Fer-
rara, Frank Ohl, and Allen Mc-
Kee will again team with strid-
ing Johnny Woodruff in the mile
relay.

A ﬁeld of six or eight stand-
out half milers will complicate
matters for Johnny Woodruff. A
tonsilectomy and insufficient
training has kept the Panther ace
from hitting his stride. This will
be his opportunity to re-enter the
national track picture.

Captain Dick Mason will go to
the post with Columbia’s Ben
Johnson.

When the University announced its new athletic
policy, which deﬁnitely removes the emphasis from
athletic contests here (mainly football), one of the
sports commentators who makes living on a
downtown paper was sad.

The school has built up a tremendous reputation,
he moaned. It has an obligation to the community;
it cannot fail the sports enthusiasts after they have
supported the school for so long; it must continue
to supply the city with Roman circuses and tossings
to the l.ions.

N 0 Gladiators

I hope the other members of the sporting gentry
don’t have the same conception. The school has an
obligation to the communi‘r,y—yes; but to provide
students, not gladiators. The University of Pitts-
burgh is a University’; diplomas are handed out by
the University of Pittsburgh, not by the University
of Pittsburgh Stadium. '

If the city must have its athletic spectacles, it
might well flock to the pro games, which are
rougher, tougher, and more skillfully played any
way. i

The new athletic policy is a highly desirable step
in the trend of handing athletics and sports back
to the student body. It is to be hoped that more
and more of the boys and girls will participate in
organized sports until, as is the case in most of the
de-emphasized schools, practically everyone plays
at something or other.

Vicarious Participation

There’s been too much of this letting the other
guy do it; of vicarious participation. We have
mass education, mass entertainment, mass recrea-
tion. A We sit back and watch the expert perform,
missing the thrill of personally taking a hand.

It is true that many players have received a col-
lege education because of their athletic ability
which they would not have obtained otherwise.
But their education has been incidental to the ex-
ploitation of their prowess in sports."

The new policy is in line with the most striving
for the division of function in modern institutions.
Let the pro leagues subsidize the athletes; let the
university subsidize the students and professors.

After having read the articles in Monday’s Pitt
News regarding the proposed Pitt Peace Council’s
Plan to boycott all Japanese made goods, we the
undersigned, believe this to be a very crack-pot
idea. How any group of intelligent college stu-
dents could attempt to make one understand that
the imports and exports could be controlled by such
a movement as proposed by this group is silly.

foreign policy, we believe that civilization of the

Former Student
Drops Education
For New Field

That a career can begin almost
anytime in life was illustrated by
the recent success of Rebecca Ro-

senbaum, graduate of the School

of Education in 1928.

Although Miss Rosenbaum had
almost earned a doctor of philoso-
pry degree, she withdrew from
the teaching vocation to enter an
entirely different ﬁeld, sociologic-
al medicine. ’

For several years Miss Rosen-
baum considered teaching her life i
work. She was graduated from
Schenley high school and then
took her bachelor’s and master’s
degrees at the University. She
worked while she was attending.
school in order to meet her ex-
penses.

Later, she became a graduate (

assistant in the modern languages
department, teaching German. At
this time, Dr. Francis D. Tyson,
professor of economics, Mrs. Ruth
C. Mitchell, present adviser on the
Nationality Rooms, and Miss Ma-
bel Gillespie, became interested
in her and urged her to continue
her education. ‘

With their encouragement, Miss
Rosenbaum resigned her teaching
position to accept a fellowship at
the University of Chicago, where
she studied sociological medicine.
Near to completing the require-
ments for a doctor of philosophy
degree in this ﬁeld as well as in
education, Miss Rosenbaum, at
present, is head of the admitting
department at the Michael Rees
hospital, in Chicago.
