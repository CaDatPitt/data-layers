“Propaganda. and the News,” by Will Irwin, has just
been received at the University Library. The author is
a former international correspondent and during the
World War had chargeof Americanpropaganda. In his
new book, he traces the development of modern journal-
ism and the forces operating in it today.

Two biographical works have come in this week. One
of them, “A Book About Myself,” by Theodore Dreiser,
is the second of four volumes. under the general title, "A'
History of Myself,” by the American novelist. It is an
account of his earlier years as a newspaper writer. '

The other is the ﬁrst volume of the papers of Gustave
Stresemann, edited and translated into English by Eric
Sutton. This collection is valuable both for its biograph-
ical material of the late German Chancellor and as a his-
tory of post-war Germany. -

Acceptance for mailing at special rates of postage
provided for in Section 1103, Act of October 3, 1917.

Authorized October 16, .1918.

More current plays have arrived at the Library during
the past few days. They are: ’ _

Hears Root’s Talk

Graduate School Head Discusses
Viewpoints Of Psychologists

 

‘Stressing the point that emotion

' obscures the means by which we ar-

rive at_ our beliefs, Dr. 'W. T, Root,
dean of the Graduate School and head
‘of the department of psychology. dis-
cussed the psychologist’s viewpoint of
reasoning . before the Psychology
Forum March 16. A '

“The psychologist,” Dr. Root stated,
“is interested in what is believed and
'Why_ the particular individual in ques-
tion believes it. From his standpoint,
a perfectly err neous belief held by
the individual is just‘ as important as
an absolute fact.”

“The orator and demagogues, arous-
ing our emotions, employ. the ‘Aristo-
telian fallacies’ to shape our beliefs.
But the psychologist is interested in
unconscious use of these errors in

logic by the general public,” said the.

speaker.

He listed the “fallacies” as: amphi--
. boly, which- is ambiguity;

composi-
tion, assuming something that is true
for the whole, to be true for the in-
dividual; division, the opposite of
is; over-
emphasis in reading, to demonstrate

A the reader’s point; accident, treating

accident as essential;-“begging the
question,” assuming the concliision
to be proved and making it part. of
the proof; and false assumption.

“Belief,” he said, “is a passive ac-
ceptance of the reports of our consci-
ousness. Doubt is dynamic; it is sus-
pension of judgment; it is great emo-
tional stress.”

Method To ‘Improve Milk

I“Milk' is ’ our. most nearly perfect

_food; it is not perfect because of its
lack ‘of iron and Vitamin D and its

high water content,” stated Dr. H. R.
Salzherg in his lecture to the Chem.-
ical engineers at the Old Mellon Insti-
tute. »

“However, the lack of Vitamin D,”
continued Dr. Salzberg, who is en-
gaged in_ research on dairy products at
the Mellon Institute, “can be easily
remedied." A-thin ﬁlm of milk, if~ex-
posed to ultra-violet_light for a short
period, will contain a much greater
amount of Vitamin D.”' '

with young couples on “ye olde ob-
servatory hill” but with Frank W.
Surovec, draftsman at the Bureau of
Business Research, it is an intrigu-
ing hobby. _

Mr. Surovec has to his credit as an
amateir astronomer, a. six-inch re-
flector portable telescope which he
managed to build in his own- work-
shop. The télescope was such a. suc-
cess that Mr. Surovec was able to sell
it to another interested astronomer.
At’ present he is engaged in the con-
struction - of a seven-inch telescope

 

which he hopes to complete within‘

four or ﬁve months.

“Building telescopes and making
their optical parts is my main inter-
est,” stated Mr. Surovec, “although I
am also interested in astronomy.”

Mr. Surovec is a member of the

Amateur Astronomers Association of

America which he describes “as a
group of amateurs who get togetherto
exchange ideas and data.”
