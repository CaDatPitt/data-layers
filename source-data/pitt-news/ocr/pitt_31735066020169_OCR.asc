Pitt-CMU open biomedical research center

By Brenda Bravis

For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh and
Carnegie Mellon University an-
nounced Wednesday the opening of
the Pittsburgh Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Center for Biomedical
Research. , A

‘ The center is located in CMU’s
Mellon Institute on Fifth Avenue.

The application of NMR to living
systems is considered by scientists to
be one of the most exciting modern.
developments in biomedical
sciences.

NMR can provide an image of the
body that is anatomically superior to
that obtained by ‘X-ray, without the
use of radiation.

According to Chien Ho Ph.D.,
director of the center, ’-’NMR is a
powerful and promising metho-
dology, but it is still in its infancy. In
order to make NMR a truly reliable
and valuable diagnostic tool and a
guide for rational management of
diseases, more research is urgently
needed.” '

results in
murder

By William Young
Staff Writer

Inadequate security in a dangerous
neighborhood resulted in the death
of an Oakland woman this week, ac-
cording to local residents and police.

Fannie D. Azen, 80, of 3436 Ward
St; was found dead Tuesday morning
by the apartment building's main-
tenance man.

City homicide detectives said that
she had been beaten to death and.
had apparently been dead several
hours before her body was
discovered. Her apartment had been
ransacked, although police have not
yet determined if a robbery occurred.

Violent crimes are not new to
Ward Street. Last year three Pitt
students were stabbed just a few
blocks from the scene of this week’s
murder, and robberies are a frequent
occurrence. .

”This building has been robbed
twice,” said Paul Carrick, resident of
the building where the murder oc-
curred. ”This summer they kicked in
my door and stole a whole bunch of
food. They broke inand stole food
and beer from some people upstairs.”

Carrick contended the reason for
the number of robberies in the
building is due to poor security.

”The windows in the building are
always open,” Carrick said, referring
to the windows that open from the
hallways onto the fire escape. ”The

doors aren't very sturdy, and none of '

them have good locks — we installed
ours ourselves.”

Tracy Rittenhouse, another resident
of the building, agreed with Carrick.

”This is what it takes to get better
locks. Someone has to get murdered.
They're just now installing new locks
for the girls who live upstairs.”

Noting security problems, Carrick
said, ”There were some kids from
Duke University in North Carolina up
here ‘in the neighborhood selling

I magazines the other day. They came

up to our building and saw the securi-
ty door on the front and decided to
go around to the back.

”They walked up the stairs to the
third floor and opened the window
there and got in and started going
door to door ‘selling their maga-
zines,” Carrick said. ”The security
doors here are a joke. You can get
into any back door with a credit card.
The front door is the same way; all
you have to do is stick a credit card
in, and it opens."

Carrick demonstrated how he
could open the front security door
with his Pitt student ID.

Carrick said that the previous ten-
nants of his room had informed him
that if he were ever locked out of the
apartment building he could open
the door by using a credit card. ’

Rittenhouse and Carrick described
Azen as a quiet lady who kept to
herself and didn't go out very much.

”I knew her to see her," Carrick

said. ”But she kept to herself and _

”.The great advantage, of course, in '
‘NMR imaging.is that it uses no radia-
tion. It is essentially non-evasiveand 
I does not have any known hazards,"

didn't come out often. She seemed
very security conscious. One day we
needed to_ use a phone so we went
up and knocked on her door to ask
to borrow it, and she wouldn't even
let us in.”
‘ Carrick said there has been a recent
upsurge in crime in the area around
Ward Street due to the large amount
of attention being given to the Forbes
Avenue incidents.

Rittenhouse agreed, ”The apart-I

ment building next door was robbed
a little while ago, and there have
been two cars stolen from here in the
last two weeks.”

”There isn't enough police
coverage in the area,” Carrick said.
”Once in,a while you see a car drive
around, but I never saw any police-
men walking a beat around here un-
til after the murder.

’’At 1 a.m. there are large groups
of 12-13-14-year-old kids walking
around, but no police.”

As of yet, the police have no
definite suspects for the murder.

a description of the impact of the

Estela Rocha, ‘29, has been a

teacherin the northern regions of
Nicaragua since 1978. Directly after
the overthrow of the tyrannical
Somoza dictatorship in 1979, she
beca_me»a member and technical ad-

» visor in the National Literacy Cam-

paign from‘.March to August 1980.

The literacy campaign was a
United Nations sponsored. crusade
against illiteracy, organized less than
one.month after the fall of the
Somoza*regime. When it began, il-
literacy in Nicaragua was at 52
percent.

According to Rocha, when the
campaign ended six months later,

I overall illiteracy was reduced to 12

percent and still dropping.

Rocha was put in charge of 700
men in the mountain country of the
northern region. Her job was to first
teach them how to read and write,
and then teach them the
methodology on how to use their
own training to teach others. She said
at first it was very difficult getting
used to living together, but after a
short period it became a wonderful
experience.

Rocha said one of the most,

fascinating aspects of their time
‘together was the crossing of many
cultural barriers by herself and many
of the men. Many of them, including
Rocha, had been city dwellers and
had no idea of mountain living.

While she was teaching literacy,
she was learning as well the use of
a machete, how to keep farm animals
and outback living techniques.

Rocha said she feels that her work
with the campaign was very produc-
tive and prosperous for the people of
Nicaragua. She said it was just as
hard ending her work as it was

The Somoza regime lasted almost I
45 years before its overthrow. It‘
began in 1936 when the United
States instated Anastasio Somoza
Garcia as president. He ruled 20
years until his assasination in 1956
by Rigoberto Perez. His son, Louis
Somoza Debayle, then assumed
power. Louis became sick, and an in-
terim president, Rene Chick, was put
i n as ruler. He was very popular with
the people of Nicaragua and they
wished him to continue, but Louis_
Somoza and his brother had him ‘
assasinated, and Louis again took
power. After his death, his son,
Anastasio ll, ruled until the revolution
in 1979.

particular center is devoted to
research/’. Cyert said. ”We expect to
see scientists from Carnegie Mellon
and Pitt utilizing the facility.”
According to Cyert, there is not
enough time available for everyone
who wants touse the machine, so
there has to be an allocation process.
”We do not anticipate scientists
from other universities -— except on

« an occasional basis when they have

problems that cannot be solved by
their own equipment -— using the
machine.” ’
The Pittsburgh NMR Institute, on
Craft and Fifth Avenues is used
specifically for clinical purposes by

' the 12 area hospitals.

The center at Mellon Institute is
used purely for research, although
there is a flow of information be-
tween the two. A

The NMR system which will be
used at the new center is the first of
its kind in the world. The system is
called the Burker Biospec ll System
and has a 4.7 Tesla magnetic field
strength. -

This higher magnetic field strength
yields more sophistocated multi-
nuclear measurements‘ and spec-
troscopic measurements using living,
medium-sized animals. This will give
researchers their clearest picture to
date of the complex chemical
systems in living organs.

”Professor H. T. Kung has

designed, and we have built at:

Carnegie Mellon, a new supercom-
puter called the WARP,” said Cyert,
who feels the center will be strength-

ened by the fact that Pitt and CMU
will be able to utilize their computer
knowledge to a great extent to
strengthen the work that goes on at
the center. ”

”The establishment of the Pitts-

" burgh NMR Center for Biomedical

Research represents a major commit-
ment on the part of both Carnegie
Mellon and Pitt in their effort to make
contributions to the field of
biomedical sciences,” said Dr. Ho.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar stated,
”This is another example of the
cooperation between the two univer-
sities and illustrates what higher
education can do for basic-science
research that will benefit all mankind
in unforeseen ways.”

The NMR system at the Center,
whose machine weighs 4 tons, cost

iapproximately $850,000, while

others of a higher magnetic field can
cost up to $1.5 million. Because th_e
system has to be cooled with liquid
helium and nitrogen monthly, the
upkeep will be -very expensive. Pitt
and CMU have committed $100,000
for partial operating expenses during
|986-87. .

' The Richard King Mellon Founda-
tion has provided $1.7 million to
renovate laboratory space in the
Mellon Institute for the NMR center
and for partial payment of the NMR
system. The Ben Franklin Partnership
Program of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has donated $358,000
for partial payment of the NMR
system. Carnegie Mellon and Pitt are
also applying for substantial federal
funding for the center.

Recent increases in Oakland's
police protection may become per-
manent, according to local
authorities.

In the wake of the Oakland crime
spree of Sept. 19 and 20, additional
Pittsburgh police were brought into
the area, and campus police officers
were redeployed from the outer
edges of the university to the central
area.

The University of Pittsburgh Assis-
tant Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses said that long-range plans call
for still more officers. These officers

will enable the number of campus-

police officers patrolling the oute’r
areas to get back to former levels,
while still keeping extra officers in the
central area.

Moses said the removal of some of- -

ficers from the outer area did great

, harm to security in those areas.

”Outer security now is good
enough, but not as good as it used
to be," he said.

Moses said redeployment was

protection i n lOaklanﬂld—.l
may be retained indefinitely

necessary to make Pitt security a
”more open police presence.”

Campus police are now working -
with city police in team policing —
two-man teams of one campus officer
and one city officer. Currently, two ~
of these teams work the intersection
of Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street
on the weekends. ‘

Pittsburgh Police Chief William
Moore called the method ”the_bud-
dy system," and said the program has
been very ‘successful.

According to Moore, the purpose
of the two-man teams is to allow a
campus officer to identify students
and discipline them if necessary.

”We’re trying to separate the
mischievous students from the *
criminal e|ement,” Moore said.

Both Moore and Moses said that
tensions in the area will calm even-
tually and that extra police will not
be removed prematurely. 1

Moore said the extra officers will
stay ”until we see things have
changed.” .— 1

we often have trouble in the fall,"

ly is he coming, he's going to be our homecoming marshall this year.
The first question that comes to mind is: What on earth is a
homecoming marshall? The second is: Why him? Evidently, Roy is
going to lead the homecoming parade. It's usually such an impressive
parade, and a celebrity marshall is just going to make it better, won't

 ' he?

Sarcasm aside, Pitt's selection of Roy Rogers raises some questions.
- It's true that this is our bicentennial homecoming, and the parade
will most likely be a more extravagant affair this year, so it does merit

" a celebrity to lead the whole thing. But what on earth does a televi-

‘sion cowboy have to do with the history of Pitt?

Roy and his wife, Dale Evans, are strong supporters of Pat Robert-
son's presidential campaign. Does the fact that Roy's coming here
tell the world, directly or indirectly, that Pitt is also lending support
to Robertson? That may sound a bit off-the-cuff, but it is an issue which
deserves further consideration. Robertson has gained too much
ground already, and appearances by his celebrity supporters certain-

seriously as a politician, so much so that he may end up a legitimate
contender in the Republican primaries in the next election.

t Rogers also lends his name to the only national fast-food restaurant
which operates inside a university-owned building, namely the
Cathedral of Learning. Is it a mere coincidence that Rogers has also
been selected to be our marshall? Who's kidding whom?

Whoever selected Rogers made a mistake. Not only are his political
views non-representative of Pitt, but an entrepreneur/T V cowboy on
a horse named ”Trigger” will look horrendously out of place riding
do_wn Fifth Avenue in the parade. Maybe for the tricentennial some-
one will select a more.representative homecoming marshall.

NCAA proposals

[shelved as usual

Remember a few weeks ago when President Posvar attended a
meeting of the NCAA’s President's Commission, and they were go-
ing to make all of those proposals regarding cuts in athletic practice-
time and expenditures so that the athletes would have more time to
be students? They were going to cut the amount of scholarships award-
ed, decrease the size of full-time coaching staffs and eliminate spring
practices. Well, all of those fun reforms got cut except for one. Divi-
sion I and II freshmen athletes will have to have minimum standard-
ized testscores and grade point averages.

The commission chairman, Maryland's Chancellorlohn Slaughter,
said that ”higher education is there to educate the student; academ_ics

, I must take precedence over athletics.” idealistic and well—meaning

words, but the president's commission doesn't seem to want to do
anything to makerthose words a reality.

They've been considering many reforms for a long time, such as

- the ideas to tie the number scholarships a particular school is allowed

to grant to the graduation rates of its athletes, and making freshmen

automatically ineligible. These are good solid proposals, but why.
doesn't anyone ever act on them?

_ It seems that the NCAA is considering all of these changes just to
keep the media and academia off of its back. They make the pro-
posals very public so that their adversaries will quiet down a little.
However, when the pressure wears off, the reforms get shelved.
It's time to make some legitimate reforms. A college education
should be more than the last step before a career in professional sports.

What are they telling us?‘

Last week, a group of Americans
had their plane full of weapons shot
down over the jungles of communist
Nicaragua. That would have been er-
ror enough in itself, but one of the
crew members added to the mistake
by claiming that he was flying the
mission for the CIA. Not done in the
new Reagan America. Sorry, guy.

I have no way of knowing whether
the man was right, and, in light of
that, this won't be an examination of
the merits ofxthe case. That investiga-
tion is best left to the able hands of
the Senate committees.

When the crewman, Hasenfus,
made his statement, everyone from
the president to the head of the CIA
was falling over one another for the
chance to denounce his claim. Psy-
chologists were paraded in front of
the media, claiming he was under
stress of interrogation and that his
remarks were obviously not his own.
All very possible, even likely, but
agaih, I am not in a position to judge.

I am in a position to be worried,
though, and worried lam. When the
officials were screaming about the
impossibility of the accusations, they
made some comments that merit fur-
ther examination.

Some of the statements flying
around suggested something less
than the confidence they were meant
to instill. One man said that the mis-
sion was not the work of the CIA,
because if it were, ”there would be
all kinds of electronic surveillance.

  MATT
THORNTON

Obviously this one had none of that.”
Indeed. Did he mean to imply that
if the CIA were to carry arms to the
Contras, which of course they
understand as illegal, they wouldn't
get caught? I feel a lot better know-
ing that our intelligence agency is
much too good at circumventing the
law to get caught.’

The same person also stated that it
would be ”rather ridiculous” for the
government to use a front company
that was a known CIA operation. Can
we take it as read that they have com-
panies to use if the need arises so that
they won't get caught? I see a familar
shroud of secrecy descending on
their words.

In essence, the U.S. officials are
saying the mission in question was
much too primitive for an organiza-
tion as sophisticated as the CIA. Not
very heartening for someone against
clandestine action in a government
of the people, by the people and for
the people.

Nowhere was the question of
secret arms shipments to the Contras
answered. The officials blew a little
smoke about the legality of such an
endeavor, but history teaches us that
not everything done in the ”war

against communism” is out in the
open and legal. Does anyone remem-
ber the Bay of Pigs?

There is considerable discontinui-
ty in the statements circulating in the
papers. One expert said that the pilot
who was killed in the crash ”was a
patriot. The Sandinistas couldn't have
given him enough money  to work
for them.” Innocence dripping from
every word, no?

But again, I am not concerned with
Hasenfus’ guilt or lack thereof. I
worry about the implications I see in
the words of our leaders. When the
experts in the field can't offer
evidence more convincing than as-
sertations that the downed missions
weren't well enough disguised to be
the work of the CIA, I wonder. I have
visions of things going on in the
”shadow world networks,” things too
reprehensible for the public.

If the intelligence organizations of
the country feel the need to conduct

operations they don't wish to share‘ -

with the public, they should at least
have the decency to lie well. It would
save us all a lot of needless worry.

Ortega claims that Hasenfus will be
tried for his crimes under the San-
dinista judicial system. If the man
committed a crime there, let him
stand trial as a common criminal. If
the man was on a mission for the

»CIA, let them help, not with empty

rhetoric, but with the well-disguised
and unstoppable missions they are so
proud of.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October I7, 1986

 

 

I'm worried aboutthe effects of thepill

Q. My wife had a condition that
caused her gynecologist to prescribe
the pill instead of other types of birth
control. She has been using it for over
a year without ill effects, but I am
worried a little. I've heard things.
What do you think about the pill and
its side effects?

A. I never recommend the pill
without saying that it should be pre-

scribed and recommended by a phys- '

ician, a gynecologist. If a gynecolo

gist says a patient should use the pill

rather than another method and can
use it safely, there is no argument
against it. I do know that I would
want any woman close to me to have
her gynecologist monitor her and the
method as it works with her. She
should have checkups with her gy-
necologist yearly or more often and
each time discuss the pill as it affects
her physical being.

Some time ago I was more cautious

and tended to prefer other methods"

since effects of the pill were still un-
predictable — but even then, in cer-
tain circumstances, I would tell a
woman to go to a gynecologist and
have her prescribe the pill for her if
it were medically safe. A woman
might be so fearful of pregnancy that
she could never have a good sexual
relationship, for instance; using the
pill reassures her.

Americans are difficult to

The American public has an in-
satiable need to be entertained.
Sometimes, when you're not really
looking for it, you find out how
quirky that need can be.

I was walking around Chicago's
downtown area on a recent Saturday,
and I found myself in the middle of
a scene that was being shot for The
Untouchables, a film currently in pro-
duction about the Al Capone-Eliot
Ness era in Chicago. I suppose that
if you cover the movie business, you
quickly become jaded to all of the
trappings that are part of location
filming. But I'm not around movies
all that much, and I was struck by all

- of the things that movie-goers never

see.
All up and down Wabash Avenue,
there were trailers parked for the
main actors to change their clothes
and wait between scenes. There were
teamsters all over the place, doing the
heavy work involved in setting things
up. A catering truck provided food for
the actors and crew, and an am-
bulance with paramedics stood by,
just in case there was a problem.
Dozens of extras, all dressed in
Prohibition-era costumes, waited for
their chance to walk along the street
to provide background atmosphere.

Saturday

"Matthew, Matthew, come watch
this cartoon with us!" my little sisters
begged as they dragged me out of my
Saturday morning bed. I staggered
sleepily down to the family room
where our color TV was announcing,
”Now it's time for the Hulk Hogan
Cartoon Show!” A smiling, blond
figure supposedly representing
Hogan dashed onto the screen, wav-
ing a muscular arm to everyone
watching.

”Oh, God,” I groaned. My sisters
stayed glued to the tube.

In this cartoon episode, Hulk and
some fur-hatted Soviet wrestler (I
think his name was Yuri — a typical
Russian name, right?) had been
launched into orbit to rescue two
astronauts trapped in the cargo bay
of a space shuttle. To add to the ten-
sion, Hulk and Yuri only had a few

minutes to use their incredible (ack) :

wrestling strength to pry open the big
payload doors before a satellite
crashed into it, blowing all to space
dust.

Q. I am just not interested in sex
when I am with my husband. My de-
sire is low; I feel tired. He is a good
husband to me and father to our son,
and I don't want to hurt him. But

‘ while I have a strong desire for cer-

tain other men, _in my middle age I'm
just not attracted to my husband.
A. Keep telling yourself that and
you can really talk yourself into it.
Now, I am not saying that everything
is your fault — your husband may not

be doing all he should to keep you A

responsive to him. But you, as a big,
grown-up woman with a nice hus-
band and a son, should think of
yourself as responsible for keeping
that marital sex life happy and
rewarding. You have to be willing to
be turned on by that husband. Don't
build up in your mind a long story
about how you are not turned on. We
are capable of controlling our im-
aginations, our perceptions of people
and events and our desires.

I would like you to go to a sex
therapist by youself to discuss this
problem — not for a long, expensive
course of therapy, but for a talk, a
sorting-out of your feelings. If this
seems‘ out of the question, try to
make those times with your husband
more special and romantic, prepar-
ing yourself with helpful fantasies, the
time and the place with things like

I spoke with some of them; they had
driven in from the suburbs and had
been provided with the proper attire
for the year 1930, which is when the
movie takes place. On the sidewalk
were two huge boxes holding
nothing more than pairs of old-
fashioned shoes.

I have heard that a major motion
picture on location costs at least
$50,000 a day to film, and I could
believe it by the scope of what I was
seeing. Depression-era automobiles

were lined up on the street; expen-‘

sive camera gear was lifted into
place. The film's director, Brian
DePalma, was walking around, in
charge of all this. The day's action in-
volved a stunt man being shoved off
the top of a building. The illusion was
that he would wind up ”dead" on the
hood of a car below.

I stood and watched for a while. All
of this effort will eventually count for
no more than a few seconds on the
screen when the film is released next
summer. I thought about that as I
walked away; so much work that -is
taken for granted by the people who
buy the tickets for movies. _

I walked north up Michigan
Avenue, and I figured that since I had
been thinking about movie-making,

morning

OK, pretty good for a cartoon — in-
ternational cooperation, an exciting
storyline and two popular figures in
space.

Yet the cartoon’s plot focused on
how stupid and bungling Yuri be-
haved. Yuri wastes time waving to
"Mother Russia” through a TV
camera instead of concentrating on
opening the payload doors. Yuri
clumsily opens a food compartment,
letting mushy grapes and sandwiches
smear all over his suit’s helmet. Yuri
stupidly drifts off helplessly into
space and has to be rescued by Hulk.
Yuri, the idiot savant.

"Russians are stupid," my one
sister announced.

What was this cartoon teaching my
little sisters? While Hulk is the blond
American god, Yuri is the typical
"stupid" Soviet. My sisters were
learning terrible stereotypes.

The cartoon show had other blatant
stereotypes, too. The Iron Shiek was
an evil and scheming Arab. The
NASA scientists were bald nerds with
glasses. The Scottish wrestler was ar-

Q. I ‘got used to trying to please
him and interest him because he was
a virgin and hard to get interested.
Now I have an interested lover, but
he is so intense about wanting us to
have our orgasms together that I
tense up and can't have one at all.

 

maybe I ought to stop and see one.
So, at Water Tower Place, I went in-
to one of the theaters and sat down
in the dark with the rest of the au-
dience.

The movie was running, and I was
paying more attenion than usual to
the scenes. I was thinking about how
even the simplest scenes in the movie
probably had taken most of a day of
shooting, with all the detail work and
hurly-burly that I had just witnessed
on The Untouchables set.

The audience in the theater was sit-
ting quietly, watching the movie.

rogant. Is this what networks believe

scientists and people from other na-
tions are like? .

Think for a second. What is your
impression of a Soviet citizen? An
evil KGB agent with no compassion
for his fellow man? A brainwashed,
intimidated Orwellian commoner?
An unemotional pieceof the Soviet
military machine that will overrun
America and her allies at the first op-
portunity?

Have you ever met a Soviet?

I have met six Soviets in my life,
and all were warm, friendly yet
somewhat intimidated people who
took their work as scientists and
athletes very seriously. One, a

physicist who had hair and wore an ,

Op beach shirt (Is this a Soviet nerd?)

A. At the beginning of this century,
the best writer on sex was a man
named Van de Velde, and he was ter-
rific, but like pioneers of every sort,
he had some mistaken notions. One
of the things he went on about was
simultaneous orgasms. The height of
sexual harmony in a marriage was for
husband and wife to have orgasms
simultaneously.

The truth is, striving for this fic-
titious perfection made a lot of peo-
ﬁe tense up the way you do and not
enjoy sex that might have been very
good otherwise. Tell your boyfriend
to forget about this high-wire bicycle
act of orgasming together and think
about sharing real life, good sex with
you.

Q. I've been going with a guy in
a band, and he is attentive to me if
we are alone, but at a party he is
always with other people, laughing
and flirting and leaving me alone. I
complain, but he says -the band
members all have-an image to keep
up. He will leave me alone three or
four days at a time, no phone call,
no show of interest; then comes a
call, and I am supposed to be on
hand for whatever. This is confusing
because alone with me he is really
charming.

And then something happened.

The film snagged in the projector,
and one frame was caught between
the lens and the bulb.

Slowly, the heat from the projec-
tor light began to melt the frame of
film. The frame turned light brown
and then dark brown, and then it
began to curl up and devour itself. All
of this was being magnified hundreds
of times upon the screen in front of
us.
And the members of the audience
reacted more strongly than they had
to anything in the movie itself up to
that point.

”Look at that!” someone said out
loud.

Another person said, ’’It’s like a
light show.”

Within seconds‘ strangers were talk-
ing to strangers; people were
laughing and chattering away and

commenting about what was hap— -

pening to the burning, melting piece
of film.

It was the most vocal reaction that
I had heard in a movie theater in a
long time. People laugh at the funny
parts of comedies, of course, and
sometimes gasp or scream during
suspense films. But that is expected;
the moviemakers count on that.

apart. I couldn't believe these were I
the same men we were fighting and '

reminded mesa lot of my grandfather.
We spent an entire afternoon

debating whether democracy or com-
munism was the better system of
government, and although in the end
we remained staunch in our beliefs,
he told me, _”For a young capitalist,
you are to be admired.” It was the
best compliment I ever got from
anybody.

I wish my two sisters had a chance
to meet these real-life Soviets. Unfor-
tunately they only have television
cartoons and the World Wrestling
Federation every Saturday afternoon.

I remember one of my neighbors
telling me of how they called the
Germans ”Krauts" during World War
II. ".We didn't think of them as peo-
ple," he said. ”They werejust Krauts.
Yet, whenever we came across one
of their bodies, hell, he looked just
like a relative back home. The
prisoners I met were wonderful peo-
ple,. too. They cried. They laughed.
They sang songs. They even beat you

at poker. Only their accents set them .

Dub Squad entered a contest spon-
sored by WYDD and Citiparks on Ju-
ly 28 where they took first place out
of six bands. That landed them a brief
stint at Graffiti on Sept. 4.

Bill Palowitch, former guitar player

of Dub Squad, made a guest ap-

pearance at the performance.
Palowitch was an original member of
the band and consequently intro-

-duced Dub Squad’s current percus-

sion player Hutchinson to the band.

The band has recorded one song,
”Love Needs a Strong Foundation,”
and Hutchinson said it is played on
WPTS, WRCT and WXVX.

Curt Resch, lead guitarist, is the
newest member of the band.

’‘I’d like to play more of my own
stuff, but I think I have to wait until

triumphant, education for all the peo-
ple was to be one of their first tasks.
They fulfilled that promise.

This education system is now
divided into two proposals. The first
is that the regular education program
and the health programs for all the
people will be kept free. The second
is that the progressions created by the
literacy campaign will continue so
that new teachers will always exist.

Rocha claims the revolution was
spawned not primarily from politics
but from the stagnating state of the
Nicaraguan people due to the lack of
education and proper training.
However, she does see a connection
between the two. .

”We say it's political because we
were born out of a revolution.”

However, the Sandinistas have
since met with opposition from a
groupwho want to go back to the
previous lifesty_le of firm government
control. This group, dubbed Freedom
Fighters by Ronald Reagan, are the
Contras.

Rocha has lived among the Contras
and said she disagrees with Reagan
that they are actually freedom
fighters.

”What does freedom have to do
with any of their goals? The people
of Nicaragua are more free now than
any other time. They want power,
and that's all. They will again preach
ignorance to the people and again try
to dominate.”

”Ronald Reagan is as much a part
of this ignorance as any. If he believes
[the Contras] are looking out for the
good of Nicaragua, then he's totally
crazy.‘ No, they are not fighters for
freedom, but fighters for economic
ambition.”

Rocha said when the opposition
groups formed they were not very
big, but have grown into being

I get more comfortable with the
band,” Resch said.

But keyboard player Craig Dye said
the original band played a lot of in-
strumentals with no lyrics.

”People got so bored because all
we did was dub. So that's how we
got our name," Dye said. .'

Dye and Kauffman played with
drummer Dave Yoho in the local reg-
gae band The Uprisers.

All. the members of the band
agreed that the reason they got into
reggae was because they were influ-
enced by Bob Marley.

popular. She attributes their populari-

ty now to the amount of money and
tactics given them by the U.S.
government and C.l.A.

Rocha said the Contras are made
up of several groups,-most of which
were strong nationalists under
Somoza, including the‘ former na-
tional guard and Somoza loyalists.
She also said she knows of several
American mercenaries in the Contra
camps. —

”You know, the ones who think
killing is glorious and fun. -The ones
who probably wouldn't know real
courage if it hit them in the face,”
Rocha said.

Rocha said she feels very concern-
ed now about military intervention in
Nicaragua. ' '

”lf America gets more involved, it
could not only be another Vietnam

for them, but could be the start of

World War lll. U.S. military interven-
tion is not the helping of freedom, but
invasion. The people of Nicaragua
fought too hard for what they have

_now to give it up again to U.S.

domination. Nicaragua will be in
ashes before that happens again.”
”What I am-doing here now is
responding to a plea that I give a call
to the people of the U.S. we know
that theylwill see what we have
fought and died for and will do so
again if we have to and agree with
us.” —
”Don’t believe the 100 percent
disinformation Reagan is giving.
America also was born from revolu-
tion. We have a right to our country,
May we now live in it in peace.”

By George Patterson

I know, I know. I'm supposed to be
writing in the perspective section. Well,

I just got a little tired of writing about ,

black students not getting enough finan-
cial aid, Jim Mumma and the SGB
_crowd and South African rallies. Those
things are all important, mind you. I just
would rather write about something a
‘tad more fun.

I was telling this to a guy with whom

I work. He told me I should interview ’

his brother. ”What is so special about
his brother?” You, the astute reader,
must be asking yourself. Well, his
brother, Jimmer Podrasky, is the lead
singer of The Rave—Ups. You know, that
band you hear all the time on WPTS
(our campus station) and the band you
saw in Pretty in Pink.

Well, Jimmer happened to be in the

’Burgh for his brother's wedding. I gave -

him a call, and he came over to The Pitt
News office where we chatted for an
hour and a half. Oh yeah, he brought
along his girlfriend, Beth Ringwald,
MoIly’s.oIder sister. She was pretty all-
right a_nd rather on the gorgeous side
to boot. I

All that I knew about Jimmer and The
Rave—Ups was what I had learned from
Jimmer’s brother, Mike. He told me that
Jimmer graduated from CMU a few
years back and was prettywild. Mike
said that Jimmer was the kind of'guy
who was brilliant, but would never let
you know it outright. I soon found out
that this is true. What I also found ‘out
is that this band will take off, soon. Not
because of crazy costumes or any such
glitz, but because they have soul. They
have a mixture of meaning and humor
in their music, and their lead singer has
a mixture of humility and humor that is
rare.

GB: So, what's it like to be back?

JP: Really nice. Not too much has
changed. I heard that the "O" has ex-
tpanded.

GB: Yeah, it has. So", what were_your
days at CMU like?

JP: Well, I was a/ DJ on WRCT on
Tuesday nights. My friend and I would
put on the whole side of a Rolling
Stones record and "just get really
trashed while it played. I was an English
literature and writing major. In fact, I
didn't even pick up a guitar until I was
22 and in my senior year.

GB: So, what bands influenced you?

JP: Well, now I really like The
Replacements. I still listen to the music
that I listened to then — The Rolling
Stones and Dylan. — '

GB: I know The Rave—Ups were in
Pretty in Pink; why weren't any of your
songs on the soundtrack?

JP: At the time, the entire band was
working at A&M Records, who put out
the soundtrack. It was kind of a political
thin . See, we were kind of the
mailboys at A&M, and I guess A&M
didn't want mailboys on the
soundtrack.

GB: That's kind of raw. Did The Rave-
Ups start in Pittsburgh?

‘JP: Sure did. Our first time playing
was a party on McKee Place. We even
used to practice at a house on McKee
Place. We pretty much tore that place
down. Then we started to play at bars.
There's no other experience like play-
ing at a bar. Our first,_t_ime was at Fat
City. It was a big thing to us, a really

big thing. Then we played at
The Decade and The Electric
Banana. There's got to be
places like that for young bands
to play and get a start.

GB: So, why did The Rave-
Ups leave?

JP: The initial reason for the
band to go to LA. wasn't sole-
ly for music. ltwas for play. We
were the band in a Sam Shep-
herd rock ’n' roll play called,
Toot/7 of Crime. lt ran for about
two months.

GB: How about after that?

JP: We came back home and
decided that LA. wasn't too
bad a place and that there were
a lot of clubs‘ to play out there.
So we packed up and moved.
We dissolved about three
weeks after. I somehow decid-
ed that l wanted to stay in L.A.
I didn't have a band. l just got
to know some people and we

formed The Rave—Ups from
scratch. Two of the guys are
from California and the other
guy, Terry, who plays guitar, is
from Missouri. He used to play
in a band called The Ozark
Mountain Daredevils.

GB: Did you like Pretty in Pink?

JP: I didn't think Pretty in Pink
was a particularly good film, but
l knew having songs in a major
motion picture wouldn't hurt. It
paid well, and l knew that my
comments wouldn't hurt the
movie at all.

GB: What do you think of
Molly [Ringwald]?

JP: When | met her, I just knew
that she was Beth's sister who
was trying to be an actress. She
was -l4 and kind of awkward-
looking. Fourteen is a really hard
age. She has matured into a
beautiful and talented actress.
It's funny, in L.A., you see so
many teen—age girls trying to
look like Molly. Like Mexican
girls. Molly just got back from
Japan [where the movie has just
been released] and there will
probably be Japanese girls try-
ing to look like Molly, too.

GB: Do you think you'll sign
with a major label for your next
album?

JP: There are some things in

the works. Fun Stuff is our label
now. They released two singles,
but won't release the new
record. When l worked at
A&M, I saw how the system
works. it's easy to know who's
going to go somewhere when
you unload a truck with 65,000
Brian Adams posters, then
another with 2,000 Dream Syn-
dicate posters. Some bands are
signed as tax write-offs. Most
bands see a record deal as the
end of their growth period. Real-
ly, that's when the work begins.
You should act as if you never
played before. Also, some
labels are terrified of the direc-
tion we're going [in]. They say,
either be a country band or a
rock ’n' roll band, but not both.
The cuts on the new album are
a little more hard edge than
Town and Country.

GB: What really made you
go into music in the first place?

JP: I was a senior at CMU and
was going through that "what-
the—hell—am-l-going-to-do—with-
my-|ife?” time. I had two op-
tions. l could go on and keep
getting degrees or find a
teaching position somewhere.
Both my parents-are teachers. |
wanted to be a writer, but the
guys who were supposed to be

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October l7, T986

America's best writers would tell
me when they were speaking at
school that you couldn't make a
living just writing. They were all
professors at a small college or
something. The odds to make it
in a band are better than mak-
ing it as a serious writer. I'm a
little shocked that l stayed in it.

GB: Were you always
musical?

JP: l had a late start on the
musical end of things. l still don't
see myself as a musician or a
singer. But I get out whatl have
to get out.

GB: It seems to have worked.‘

Do The Rave-Ups have a deep
message?

JP: l never wanted The Rave-
Ups to be a real serious band
like U2. I also didn't want them
to be just a fun rock 'n' roll band.
The Rave-Ups sing about things
we care about but we do it with
a sense of humor.

GB: Beth, I feel as if I've
neglected you. How'd you guys
meet?

Beth: I just started hanging
around the band at clubs.

JP: Yeah, she was the drum-
mer's girlfriend when I first met
her. That didn't work out, and
we just started seeing each other
after that. _V__V_e've' been__see;igg

each other on and off for four
years now.

GB: One last question: Tell me
about live Ea’.

JP: That was kind of embar-
rassing. lt was a benefit in Dallas
for the Mr. Ed Fan Club. There
was this guy who sponsored it
with a radio station, KCEW in
Dallas, that had played us a lot.
They really wanted us to play.
It was a benefit, so the band
didn't get paid. But they put us
up in this unbelievable hotel for
a couple days. l think Reagan
stayed there the week before
we did.

Beth: Next year they're call-
ing it Hooves Across America.

So, after 90 minutes, a couple
cups of coffee and some pic-
tures, the interview was over. All
I can say is that l wish The Rave-
Ups the best of luck, although
they won't need it. This is a
band from whom we will be
hearing big things. lf you're
familiar with the band, you know
what l mean. lf you don't know
the band, do yourself a favor
and pick up their album and
rememberthe name. Also, be on
the lookout for a Rave—Ups East
Coast tour very soon. Who
knows, maybe someday they'll
be lip—synching on So/la’ Go/a’.

The musical story is told from
the point of view of the patient,
through harpsicord, viola da
gamba and a narrator. The sec-
tion titles show appropriate
pathos: sight of surgical in-
struments, trembling at the sight,
decision to mount the table, ty-
ing down of arms and legs, se-
rious reflection, the operation
begins, the knife is inserted, the
stone is removed, patient passes
out, blood flows, patient is taken
off to bed, convalescence.

Marais was .a composer in the
court of Louis XI._\/ of France,
who, history tells us, also had an
operation for the removal of a
stone. Since it was a custom of
the time to practice an operation
on local subiects of the realm
before taking a scalpel to the
king, it was possible that Marais
was one of the unlucky guinea
pigs. Happily for the music

of this filmwas wasted on pro-
longed jokes that did not work.
Much of the materialwas unin-
teresting and very cliched.
Many parts tried to be heart-
warming and tender, especially
the ending, but they never quite
achieved it. The end was far
better than the beginning, and
there are‘ certain times when one
can actually feel what is going
on. Most of the -time, though,
one is detached and dishearten-
ed by the happenings on the
screen. There were a few
believable scenes interspersed
among the ridiculous ones, but
as a whole the film was
uninspired. ‘ .
Rae Dawn Chang and James
Earl Jones are the two people in
the film’ who give credibilityto
their characters. Chang plays
Howell's love interest who is
cool to his advances through

4 mostof the movie. Her character

does not particularly like Howell
at first, but eventually, through
his persistence, they get togeth-
er to study, and their relationship
grows from there. Chong fills the
part with a warm persona that
is absent in most of the other per-
formances in the film. James Earl
Jones is imposing as a criminal
law professor, Rutherford Banks,
and is inspiring to watch even in
a movie as bad as this. His voice
commands respect, which ‘is
why he was chosen to do the
voice of Darth Vader in the Star
Wars trilogy. He has the only
truly believable and well—written
part in the film, and he plays it
with an authoritative excellence.

Sou/ Man is‘ one of those films
with noble intentions that does
not have the personnel to ac-
complish what it set out to do.
ln the hands of a different writer,
the story may have been more
believable, and the film could
have been enjoyable. As it is,
this movie poses no credible
social comment and fails miser-
ably in its attempt at comedy.

On a scale of one to lO, this
movie rates a three.

Hey Sid, hope your film. is better thn the soundtrack

 

Love Kills: Less than Vicious

SID AND NANCY
(Original Soundtrack)
Various Artists

MCA Records

By John Young
While The Ramones might

have predated them, the Sex

Pistols become the embodiment
of punk rock with the release of
their classic 1977 album Never
Mind The Bo//oc/<5 and with the
surveillance the world subse-
quently placed them under. But
this band of supposedly ”tal-
entless" young makers of
”noise" that forever altered the
music world quickly self-
destructed, most violently in

bassist Sid Vicious’ suicide com-

mitted while he awaited trial on
charges of murdering his
girlfriend Nancy Spungen.
Repo Man writer/director Alex
Cox considers the life of Vicious
in his new film, Sid And Nancy.

While not yet released here, if
the film's soundtrack gives any
indication of the quality of the
movie, it won't be worth seeing.
While the record's media in-
formation notes the ”cutting
edge" that Vicious lived on and
that his music had, only one
band on the album does any-
thing chancy, new or interesting.
The Pogues’ two contributions
are outstanding. ”Haunted” is
an uncharacteristically iangly,
dynamic rock song sung convin-
cingly by Cait O’Riordan, and
"Junk" isan unsettling folk’"in-
strumental with a colossal snare
beat. But the rest of the record
is disappointingly forgettable.
Joe ‘Strummer contjnues his
post—Clash — the real Clash_—
decline with the flat, all-too-
reserved ”Love Kills" and the
poorly thought-out ”Dum Dum
Club.” Even worse is Sex
Pistols’ guitarist Steve Jones’
mediocre, mechanical-sounding

   

”Pleasure And Pain” which
sports some woefully—cliched
lyrics.

One might hope for the Circle ’

Jerks to deliver a raw, high-
energy boost to the album, but
their song ”Love Kills” (different
from Strummer’s) is slickly pro-
duce filler. Former Velvet
Underground member John
Cale adds the tame, largely

uninteresting ”She Never Took,

No For An Answer.”

Actor Gary Oldman does-a
pretty good imitation of Vicious’
singing on the Stooges song ’’I
Wanna Be Your Dog”-and the

classic Pistols cover ”My—-

Way,” but one questions the

need for near carbon—copy-

remakes of these songs. ’

Only an album that strays so
far from the ideals of the musi-
cian whose memory it intends to
recall could be this bad. Here's

hoping the film proves far less

miserable.

might also mention that there is

This was not an easy collec-
tion for Bragg to assemble. The
album cover describes Ta/king to
the Taxman as "the difficult third
album.” ltwas probably difficult
simply because the singer was
forced to compete with his own-
auspicious catalogue.

One final note: "Levi Stubbs'

CAN’T HOLD BACK
Eddie Money
Columbia

By Ike Shibley

"Take Me Home Tonight” is
one of the most listenable and
catchy singles of the year. lt.
glides through the melody with
Eddie Money sounding better
than ever and Ronnie Spector

adding a special touch singing '

her Be my /itt/e baby refrain.
Money has produced, with the
help of Richie-Zito, a great song
which shines like a beacon on

A his new album. The song has the

same charisma that some of
Money's earlier singles like
"Two Tickets to Paradise” and
''I Think I'm in Love" had, and
he again proves that he has a
definite chart marketability.

ing from hard rock to ballads.
This album does not have the
range that his previous ones had
and is very shallow in its musical
endeavors.

The only selection that really
has a rock backbeat is "Take
Me Home Tonight.” "l Wanna
Go Back" and "One Love"
both have an upbeat tempo but
never quite get rolling. They are
songs that you can sing along
with when they are playing but
then are easily forgotten. Of the
other seven songs on the record,
which are all of the same essen-
tial slow rock formula, only
"One Chance" and "Calm
Before the Storm” stand out.
Each is well written and has
Money singing with more
fullness and force than ever
before in his career.

One of the problems with this
album is an excess of- writers.
Seven songs have at least three
contributors which seems to

- have cluttered the sound. The

overabundance of contributors
hurts the songs instead of help-
ing them. In an attempt to get a
variety of input, ' the glut of
writers actually dampened the
creative forces at work in the
production of the album. The
three best tracks on the record
—_ "Take Me Home Tonight,”
"One Chance" and "Calm
Beforethe Storm" — all have
two writers. Because of this the
songs have ‘more power and
energy than any of the others.

Can't Hold Back has some tru-
ly good moments, and the
album is worth listening to just-for
them. The "entire -second side
seems to melt together because
of a lack of" diversity, yet the
music is pleasant enough, lust
forgettable. Hopefully Eddie
Money will be able to take his

richer and fuller voice and apply

it to some better material. In the

‘meantime, though, his new

album will hav-e to serve as a
foreshadowing of what may be
coming in the future.

MENDING WALL
Angst .
SST . Records

By Michael Fay T

lt has been my experience that
if a rock band is worth listening
to, their first record is an in-
troduction to a complete idea —
a sound, an image and an at-
titude. If the idea is compelling
and reasonably original and the
chemistry between the musicians
is favorable, then a multi-album
career might be justified. But if
somewhere along the line the
idea is lost or abandoned,'the
group's appeal oftenis also.
This has been the case with
Angst if their latest record /Vien-
ding Wa// is any indication.

Brothers Jon Risk and Joe
Pope, when they first formed
Angst in l982 with Michael
Hursey, has a lot more on their
minds than the chip on their
shoulders and the post—punk
posturing that was all around

“them. Like a small handful of

other bands at the time, they
were trying to bridge the gap
between popular and under-
ground music. And Angst, their
first record, was afairly suc-
cessful attempt. lt captured the

best of both worlds, combining

the irreverent sensibility of punk
with the melodic accessibility of

pOp- , '
Although the album set no-
sales records, it did catch the at-
tention of many college pro-
grammers who were attracted
to Angst's slick phrasing and

‘ quirky, almost deadpan sense off?‘

humor. Then, with some respect-
able airplay under their belt,
they moved from Happy Squid
to SST Records, a label known
for launching bands into the big
time. Mending Wa// is their sec-
ond release on SST, and it's the
second time they've failed to
capture the reckless spirit that
was so appealing on their first
record. ‘

With Mending Wa//, it seems .
that they have abandoned they-,

earlier approach for one that is
much more predictable and con-
ventional. The quirkly appeal is
gone. In its place are much
heavier, denser guitar sounds
and a lot of dark irony. Also,
they are sounding very in-

fluenced, especially by other
SST bands; Husker Du (now with

Sire records) and the Meat Pup--

pets are most often called to

mind. The beginning of "Same:

thing (I can't get used to)"
sounds disturbingly similar to
Husker Du's "Green Eyes,"
although it has got an interesting
C.h.0.[US- — —

 

The fact that they are more
derivative and less clever than
before does not mean that this
is not a good record. lt is. Both

Pope and Risk's singing voices«:"“~-

have an alluring, high-pitched
drone and their rhythm section is
tight and driven.

As a unit, Angst has a lot of
potential. They're just not taking
the chances that are required to
produce a memorable record.
As it stands, however, records
like this one tend to go quietly
out of print.

THE PITT NEWS

Tennis team
jgdrops final match

to WVU

By Beth Froelich
S ta ff J Writer

The Pitt women's tennis team lost
to West Virginia University in the last
home match of the season on
Wednesday. The final score was
West Virginia University 7, Pitt 2.

The loss did not come as a total sur-
prise to the team. Pitt hasn't won
against West Virginia in four years.

Coming off a three-game winning
streak against Allegheney, Slippery
Rock and West Liberty, the Lady Pan-
thers had a great amount of con-
fidence going into the match. They
were playing to win as many matches
as they could against the top—ranked.
West Virginia squad.

The match had extra significance
for Pitt seniorJodi Levine. This match
marked not only the last home match
of the season for Levine but also the
last season match of her tennis career
here at Pitt. Levine will be unable to

attend the Ohio University match .

tomorrow due to family obligations.

Levine was both mentally and
physically prepared for the last and
possibly most grueling match of her
college career. She knew it wouldn't
be an easy task.

But Levine rose to the occasion and
defeated Melony Kizer of West
Virginia in a spectacular three-set
match 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.

Levine was on the top of her game
and probably played the best tennis
of her life. It is a considerable ac-
complishment to beat the ,No. 1
singles player from a school with
such a strong tennis program as West
Virginia University.

”This win was the best of my col-
lege career. I was very determined to
win since it was my last match here
at Pitt,” said Levine. ”l feel I'm real-
ly on top of my game now, and I'm
prepared to do well in the Big East
Championships.”

It's difficult to pick up any major
newspaper or weekly magazine
without finding some reference to the
NCAA — Proposition 48, drug
testing, some college or university
slapped with a penalty or a host of

. other topics. The surprising-thing is

that the writers seem to imply that
these rules and interpretations are
those of the NCAA—hired staff at Mis-
sion, Kan. This perception, though
widespread, is far from the truth. The
NCAA is a voluntary organization of
over 900 colleges and universities,
with the rules and regulations govern-
ing the organization submitted and
voted upon by representatives of
these institutions. Each January, in-
stitutional representatives to the
NCAA meet to consider anywhere
from 100 to 125 amendments to the
constitution" and bylaws which
govern the actions of all members.
Naturally, not every institution is in

_ agreement with every piece -of

legislation. When the votes are
counted, however, and legislation is
enacted, all institutions are expected
to live by the votes of the majority.

As in any organization which
governs itself through a constitution
and set of bylaws, it is often necessary
to interpret the intent of each rule for
specific: situations. Such interpreta-
tions _are,.the_ responsibility of the
NCAA‘ committees or the executive

at Trees

Pitt coach George Dieffenbach was
equally enthused about Levine's vic-
tory. ”Jodi had the finest win of a Pitt
women's tennis player in five years
and probably the best victory of her
career,” said Dieffenbach. ”She
employed an intelligent strategy. She
started the match playing aggressive
tennis and continued with -that
strategy throughout the match.

”Jodi did a good job at exploiting
Keizer’s weakness, which was her
back-hand. She applied pressure at
the net at key times to make Keizer
fold. Jodi is peaking at the right time
of the season. If she plays like she did
today, she should fare well at the Big
East Championships,” he added.

The rest of the Pitt team gave a fan-
tastic effort, but they were unable to
outplay the top—ranked West Virginia
squad. ' .

Tracy Feltingoff played a com-
petitive No. 2 singles match but was
downed '6-1, 6-2 by Patti Pritt of

.,wvu.

Stephanie Nelson had a hardtime
getting warmed up in the first set; she
was shut out 6-0. She came back in
the second set, though, making
Shelley Stead of WVU work to win
the set 6-3.

The temperature, which was in the
405, had a noticeable effect on the
players, who are used to playing in
much warmer weather.

’’I couldn't get warmed up in the
first set,” commented Nelson. ”Once
I did get warmed up, though, in the
second set, I felt I was playing much

annual meetings. These committees
and the council are made up of
elected representatives from the
member institutions, with the institJ-
tional representative being approved
by the institution's chief executive of-
fice and usually its athletic commit-
tee. The major role of the NCAA staff
is to staff each of the committees and
to serve as a link between the com-
mittees and the member institutions.-

What all of this means, then, is that
when institutions are found in viola-
tion of the rules, it is an NCAA com-
mittee (the enforcement committee)
—— not the staff — that decides the
punishment. When drug testing is re-
quired, it is a committee that decides
how and what to test; when a rule is
interpreted, it is interpreted by a com-
mittee. We all recognize that such

" committees rely heavily on staff and

that staff can influence the actions of
committees by the quality of informa-
tion provided, but when this hap-
pens, it is the committee which must
be held accountable, not the staff.
When the procedures and pro-
cesses of the NCAA break down,
which they do, the fault lies with the
member institutions and the CEOs.

CEOs who don't care about what

happens and don't want to know
what is going on. And, of course,
there are those institutions concerned
only with the amount of revenues
generated, and they literally ignore
the rules and regulations. This is not
the case with all institutions, and
especially responsible institutions.
Pitt has for years been a strong sup-

porter of the NCAA and has attempt- .

ed, like many others, to live within
the intent as well as the exact state-
ment of the rules. We do have an ac-
tive University Athletic Committee
composed of faculty, administrators,
students, alumni and community
representatives. This committee,
among other functions, reviews all
NCAA-proposed legislation and, after
input from the coaches, athletic direc-
tor and other committees, advises the
president on how the institution
should vote and why. We have an ac-
tive and responsible Senate Athletic
Committee, members of whom also
serve on the University Athletic Com-
mittee, which is primarily concerned
with the academic or the student side
of the student-athlete. We have a
president who is not only knowledge-
able about the NCAA and its gover-
nance structure, but who has been
active and influential on both the
American Council of Education’s and
the NCAA’s President's Commission
on Athletics. We have an athletic
director, an academician, who not
only supports the institution and
NCAA policies, but who also repre-
sentsthe institution on the NCAA Ad-
ministrative Committee, Champion
ship Committee, TV Committee and,
more recently, on the Search Com-
mittee for a new executive director
for the NCAA. . .

Volleyball team
leading Big East

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

Pitt is it. Coming off an 11—match
winning streak, the Lady Panthers
volleyball team is sitting atop the Big
East heap, 20-5 overall and 7-0 in the
conference.

Wednesday night the Lady Pan-
thers defeated West Virginia 15-4,

.15-6 and 15-7 and easily handled

Duquesne 15-1, 15-5 and 15-4.
'’I'm real pleased that we beat West
Virginia. They've beaten some very
good teams this year,” said Pitt coach
Shelton Collier. ”They usually play
extremely well against us."
Lady Panther Denise Frawley had

A 14 kills and three errors against

WVU.Significant|y, this was Denise's
best game. She has been working on
cutting down on errors and control-
ling her spikes. This should benefit
Pitt this weekend if Frawley con-
tinues to be consistent.

The Lady Panthers are still waiting

for word on starting setter Louise
O’Shaughnessey who suffered a con-
cussion prior to the Youngstown State
match. It is still undetermined if she
will be available for tonight's match
against Kentucky.

With or without O’Shaughnessey,
Pitt is confident. Freshman Lori Silk
has been filling in for her at setter and
has performed well.

”The fact that she can be relied on

to play with a relative amount of con-

sistency is a big plus,” said Collier.

The West Virginia and Duquesne.

matches gave Pitt the chance to use
everyone on the roster. The team
played consistent volleyball which is
a good sign as they head into two

significantly tougher matches this

weekend.

When the going gets tough this
weekend, the Lady Panther volleyball
team will be ”digging in.” Pitt hosts
the University of Kentucky Wildcats
tonight at 7:30 p.m. at Fitzgerald
Field House.

One of the top teams in the South,
Kentucky is on the edge of a national
ranking. This match is a must-win for
both the Lady Panthers and the
Wildcats to keep any hopes of a na-
tional ranking alive.

Last season the Lady Panthers took
a long five——game match from Ken-
tucky. A tall, hard-spiking, much-
improved ”power team,” the
Wildcats will definitely be out for
revenge.

”Kentucky has a much—improved
team compared with last season's
team,” said Collier. ”We're also play-
ing a higher level of volleyball. Ken-
tucky has already won some big
matches this season, but so have we.
It should be an interesting match-up.”

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, October 17, 1986

The Lady Panthers host arch—riva|
Penn State Sunday at 7 p.m. in the
field house. Pitt is concentrating most
of its energy on this match. Tradi-
tionally the best collegiate match in
the East, the second-ranked Lady Pan-
thers have a score to settle with the
top-seeded Nittany Lions.

Pitt suffered its first loss of the
season (one game to three) to Penn
State. Currently ranked 14th in the
nation, the Nittany Lions are noted
for their defense.

More than a fierce rivalry rides on
this game. Pitt must win to obtain a
better seed in the NCAA tournament.

Penn State has to win to maintain its
national ranking.

Interestingly enough, the majority‘

of Penn State's roster is originally
from the Pittsburgh area. This match-
up, almost a coming-home for some,
draws 1,200-1,500 spectators.

It is questionable whether or not
starting setter O’Shaughnessey will
play tonight, but the rest of the Lady
Panther roster is healthy. Coach Col-
lier stated, ”We're comfortable using
Lori Silk as a setter if need be. We
have been playing consistently and

are confident that we can win these A. ,1

two matches.”

only had 11 guys, so that meant no
backups could go in and replace tired
players.

From then on it was all downhill
for the Penguins. Pitt came out storm-

ing, they easily drove down the fieldﬁﬁt

and eventually ended up with a side
kick. Pitt sophomore Erim Gude put
the ball into play, and junior John
Chauvin headed the ball into the net
for his first of four goals on the night.
It was less than three minutes into the
game, and Pitt already led 1-0.
The Panthers then reverted to the
offensive form that caused them to
lose the two previous games. The
defense stopped any kind of attack
that Youngstown State tried to put

together, but the offense wouldn't-Q

click. They got through the Penguin
defense easily enough, but a bad pass
or a missed kick stopped everything.
Then with three minutes left, Pitt
decided it was time to score again,
so they cut through the Youngstown
defense, and Chauvin put it in again
to make it 2-0. Less than a minute
later Chauvin scored his third goal,
and Pitt was on its way to a rout. The
half ended with Pitt, or maybe its bet-

ter to say Chauvin, leading Youngs- egg,

town State 3-0.

The second half started, and Pitt
didn't let up. Five minutes into the
half Chauvin scored his fourth goal
of the night. While all of this was go-
ing on, the Youngstown offense was
non—existant, and their defense wasn't
much to speak of, either. The Panther
offense had no trouble getting in on
the goal. With 34 minutes left in this
laugher, Pitt senior Mike Grimes
broke up the John Chauvin show by
scoring. Pitt now led 5-0. '’It was an
all around good effort," commented
Todd Smith.

The Panthers refused to show any
mercy. With 30:11 left, Pitt
sophomore Sam Lanza dovein front
of Penguin goalie Chris King to make
the game 6-0. After his goal, Lanza
came up limping; he left the game
but was not seriously hurt.

At this point Coach Lu'xbacher

began to take out his starters. The
game was still being played entirely
on the Youngstown side of the field,
but the Panthers couldn't get the ball
into the net, that is until senior Joe
Triglia had a corner kick with'20
minutes left. He put the ball straight
into the net; it was now 7-0. Five
minutes later Bob Howard made it
8-0. The game was all but over.
‘ Scott Armstrong and Jeff Vargas
added late goals to give Pitt their big-
gest margin of victory this year 10-0.
”The good thing was that everyone
got a chance to play,” said John
Sykes. ’’It feels good to get back in
the win column.”

The Panther defense must be com-
mended. They rarely let the ball get
as far as goalie Mark Hendricks. In
fact, Youngstown could only manage
four shots on goal, and none were
really threatening.

Pitt's next game is tomorrow after-
noon at Georgetown University. ’‘I
hope this game will put us on a roll,”

_ said Luxbacher. ”Georgetown is a
_ much better team}: -

New golf club  
teeing off at Pitt

By Tracy Milavec
Staff Writer

' For many avid golfers, the first signs
of spring are enough to make them
rush to the course and play eighteen
wonderful holes of golf.

Some may even brave the harsh
winds of late fall and early winter to

; tisfy their need forlgolfing. The Pan-

ther Golf Club is made up of people
who will do just that. ’

The Panther Golf Club is a newly
formed club, sponsored by the Mon-
tour Country Club. It was organized
by Sang Hong, the club's president.

”l’ve been golfing for two years
and I really enjoy it,” said Hong.
”During the summer, I played at least
five days a week and l was looking
forward to playing in school.”

But when Hong arrived at Pitt and
realized there was no golf team or
club, he took it upon himself to

qty-gganize one.

’’It took a lot of hard work to
organize thisclub,” said Hong. ”First
we had to fill out an application and
get ten signatures. Then we had to
draw up a constitution and have it ap-
proved by the activities director.
Finally we had to go to the SGB to
obtain advertisement funds.”

The Panther Golf Club is now in its

AMountaineer opponent. Katie

Highland of WVU won over deVera
6-1, 6-2 in two straight sets.

’’I was a little stiff because‘ of the
cold weather and wasn't moving
well. I was really looking forward to
playing well against West Virginia,
and I guess I'm a little disappointed
with the way things turned out,”
commented deVera.
¢'Z~f*Bonnie Kartzman, a consistent
player for the Panthers, was downed

6-0, 6-0 in No. 5 singles play by Lena.

Thoren of WVU. Kartzman was not
discouraged by the loss.

’’I felt strong playing today, and feel
I played the strongest I have all
season. I would have liked to have
won, but I played my best, and
hopefully in time that will amount to
more,” stated Kartzman.

Karen Meade rounded out the Lady
Panthers singles roster playing No. 6
singles. Meade played a good match

-,.but was beaten 6-2, 6-1 by Kathy

/Curian of the WVU team.

Levine and her doubles partner
Feltingoff secured the second win of
the day for Pitt in the No. 1 doubles
match. Levine and Feltingoff beat
Thoren and Curian of WVU in an im-
pressive 6-2, 6-2, two-set victor-y.

Levine and Feltingoff played more
smoothly than they have played
together all season. Beating a tough
doubles team such as West Virginia's

is a good indication that they will do
‘well at the Big East Championships.

Nelson and deVera, who play a
very tight doubles game together,
could not come up with a win in the
No. 2 doubles match. They were
downed 6-1, 6-2 by Kiezer and Kaper
of WVU.

DeVera commented after the
match, ”We weren't playing well to-
day. We had no rhthym. if we had
played our best, the set scores would
have been closer. WVU is a good

3 f‘“:*-‘team to play in preparation for the Big

East because the calibre of their
players is close to that of those in the
Big East Championships.”

Kartzman and Meade played a very
competitive No. 3 doubles match.
Kartzman and Meade gave Highland
and Stead of WVU a run for their
money, losing in close sets 7-6, 6-3,
6-3. 2,

The Pitt women's tennis team's
season record now stands at 7-4. The

recruiting stage. They have sixty-two
members and they are hoping to
recruit more. Anyone can join the
club. Of the sixty-two members, on-
ly two of them are girls. ’’I consider
it a social activity. it gives everyone
a chance to participate and have
fun,” said Greg Brundi, the club's
treasurer.

The club is a noncompetitive club,
meaning that they will not compete
with other schools. But, there will
definitely be competition within the
club itself.

There is no initial fee to join the
Panther Golf Club. The members will
have to pay their own green fees,
though. This may be approximately
nine dollars per outing. Hong hopes
that the transportation costs will be
paid for with funds from the SGB, but
that is still to be decided.

if the weather cooperates, the golf

- club will have one outing before

winter actually sets in. The club will
then go full force during the spring
with outings every week. The outings
will not take placeat just one golf
course. The club will play on a varie-
ty of different courses, from public to
private. it will be up to the members
to vote on the courses on which they
want to play.

three of those interceptions is Billy
Owens.

Owens came to Pitt from Christian
Brothers Academy in Syracuse, N .Y.
While at Christian Brothers, he
played running back and defensive

‘back. As a runner Owens showed

amazing potential. In his senior
season he led the Syracuse City
League in touchdowns‘ with 18 i-n a
mere eight games. H_is senior year
achievements led to several honors.
Among them were his being named

an All-City and All-State per-former.

But when Owens arrived at Pitt in
1983, he arrived as a defensive back.
He didn't last very long in the defen-
sive backfield, however.

I Owens’ running potential was
realized by then head coach Foge
Fazio. He was switched to running
back during his freshman year and he
performed well. In a few appearances

"he rushed for 116 yards on 14 car-

ries for an average of 8.3 ‘yards per

‘carry.

Things were looking good for
Owens, then tragedy struck.
At camp before the 1984 season,

Owens injured a knee. The injury.

and rehabilitation lasted through the
season and Owens was given a
medical red-shirt his sophomore year.
He did not let the injury slow him
down, however. He asked Fazio to
be switched back to the defensive
unit. Fazio allowed Owens to return
to defense because of the amount of
talent available at running back.
Under the guidance of Trent
Walters, Fazio’s defensive backfield
coach, Owens learned the system
and was ready to play. As the season
wore on, Owens saw more and more

 

Billy Owens has helped the'Pitt secondary re-establish itse_lf at Pitt after the

playing time. He eventually got a few
starts when injuries hit the Pitt
secondary. —‘f.

In the few games he played his
sopf. tore season Owens piled up
some noticeable stats. He finished the
year with 22 tackles in 6 games. He
had a‘ good year but the best was yet
to come. .»

When" Foge Fazio and staff were
.fired, the door opened for Owens. He
had a chance for a starting role in the
Panther secondary. Owens did‘ not
just open the door and waltz in.‘ He
busted the door down.

John Fox, the new defensivg"
backfield coach’, has called Owens
”the biggest surprise in the secondary
this year.” Fox gave‘Owen,s the star-
ting strong safety job because ”he has
speed, strength, and a great work at-
titude.” ' - -'

So far Owens has delivered in a big
way. ' _

As the starter at strong safety,
Owens has been impressive. In six
games Owens has 55 tackles, which

is good enough to tie him for fourth,_
on the defense. The most impressive‘

stat on Owens this year is his number
of interceptions. He has grabbed
three and returned them for an
average of 20 yards. The highlight of
this year was a 43 yard return of an
interception for a touchdown against
Purdue.

Owens time has finally come. Hav-
ing the time to become accustomed
to one position has allowed Owens
to gel and become the-best player he

can be. His maturity has strengthen-Q’-.

ed the Panther secondary.
Billy Owens is good news for the
Pitt defense.
