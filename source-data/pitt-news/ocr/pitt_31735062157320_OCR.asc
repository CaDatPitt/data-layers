Dr. Jonas E. Salk, research professor of bacteriology
in the School of Medicine and pioneer in the search for a
polio vaccine, recently described the progress in the struggle

to wipe out polio.

In a report to the 22nd annual meeting of the American
Academy of Pediatrics, held in Miami, Dr. Salk disclosed that
“There are several possible methods of producing a safe
and eﬁective vaccine against polio.”

He announced that 474 addi-P
tional children and adults in the
Sewickley and Leetsdale suburbs
of Pittsburgh have been subjected
to experimental vaccines. Findings
show that even those persons who
have no previous antibodies to
combat any of the three polio
types may obtain protection with
the proper treatment.

ically killed with 1’0rma1dehyde

the manner of production and/or

One type has been mixed in

differently -——' some between'the
layers of the skin and others di-
rectly into the muscles.

I

in vmin- T

In one testing group, first in-
jections produced no detectable
antibody, but a second produced a
startling increase in them. Dr.
Salk referred to this as a “boos-
ter” phenomenon in which the
first injection acts as an‘ “alert”
and the second one “ringing an
alarm,” sets the body process into
full—scale production of antibod-
ies to combat‘ the paralytic disease.

No Definite Vaccine Yet

The bacteriologist cautioned
though, that these are continuing
studies and that there are still
many unanswered questions be-
fore it can be said that ‘practical

vaccine has been developed.

When the time Comes for a mass
trial of a polio vaccine, however,
a choice of methods may be used,
according to the Pitt scientist: (1)
a controlled study involving alter-

‘vaccinated

nate‘ injections of a -polio vaccine

and another biological preparation

to compare their effects, and (2)
the injection of a vaccine into
children of a narrowly restricted
age group.

The latter would compare the
incidences of paralysis with the.
children, others of
their own community and children
younger and older than they. '

Praises Work

The discovery of a method for
growing polio virus in test-tube
cultures of non-nervous tissue and "
the identiﬁcation of three types
of polio virus capable of causing
the diseaserboth in the last two
years, have been fundamentally
responsible for the great strides
in polio research, according to Mr.
O’Connel, president of the National
Foundation for "Infantile Paralysis.

Girls A Tour Europe  

By NANCY COOK
(First of a Series)

It took a summer tour of Eu— 
rope to convince two Pitt co-

eds that “it’s a small World,”

but after bumping into Pitt?

alumni and Pittsburghers all
over the continent, Pat Ritz and
Elaine Love are sure "that you
never really leave home.

Traveling and studying in Eur- .

ope on scholarships which they
received for outstanding work as
-Nationality Room hostesses last
year, they met many familiar
faces during their three month
sojourn. On their voyage to Eur-
ope, Elaine met an Ambridge res-
ident, and they met Howard
Greenberger and Herman Levy,
1951 -Pitt graduates, in several
European cities. »

mer Pitt instructor now with the
American consulate in Yugoslavia,
and ‘Mr. Dunn, once associated
with the Pitt Fine Arts depart-
ment. _

The Ritz"-Love odyssey began
June 9 when the girls embarked
from Quebec aboard the “Arosa

passenger ship to cross the At-
lantic--was a ﬂoat_ing United Na-

Elaine’s next stop was a visit

to the University of Edinboroughp,
where she learned Scottish folk
dances.

For the next three weeks "she
studied Shakespeare and Eliza-

University of Birmingham classes,
she saw productions of “King
Lear,” “Richard III,”’ “Merchant
of Venice,” and “Anthony and

rejoining Pat in Paris she visited
Cambridge and London.

Dr. James Robinson Here Again

To Speakat Chapel Service

Dr. James H. Robinson, convocation speaker for Religion-
In-Life-Week last February will speak at chapel service to-

morrow. The topic of Dr. Robinson’s speech will be “Un-*

ﬁnished Business.”

Robinson was graduated at the head of his class at
Lincoln University, Pennsylvania¢
in 1-935. He was president of the
class of 1938 in Union Theological
Seminary, New York City, from
which he received his B.D. degree.

In that same year, he was or-
dained to the Christian ministry
and founded the Church of the
Master and the Morningside Com-
munity Center in Harlem with a
nucleus of less than ﬁfty Negro
Christians. ,

Today, under his leadership,
these institutions provide religious
guidance and practical assistance
to 2,000 people.

Pitt students may remember" Dr.
Robinson as the person who -se-
lected Mary Fuget for a $500
travel fellowship that started Pro-
ject India. In addition to his work
as a pastor, Dr. Robinson has given

\

prises. , r

He has helped to found the In—‘

States.

The play opens at a girls’ pri-

young women, Misses Wright and
Dobie. The ﬁrst is engaged to a
doctor. The other (who never had
a beau) is fearful the ensuing mar-
riage will interefere with the

Mary Tilford, granddaughter of
their ﬁnancial backer and friend,
Mrs. Amelia Tilford, has coerced
the other students into doing her
bidding by fear of her lying
tongue. . _ _ V

After forcing two - girls to tell
her of a quarrel between Miss
Dobie and her Aunt Lily, in which
the aunt jokingly made the remark
that her attitude. was “unnatural”

towards her, partner’s forthcoming
marriage, Mary sees her chance to
hurt her two teachers by a fab-
rication that the two are guilty
of “sinful sexual knowledge of
each other.” “

Her grandmother believes the
.lie. The two women lose "a lawsuit
for slander.and all of their pupils.

Miss Patricia Neal is able in '

the role of Martha Dobie, but
she seems to be miscast. A teach-
er, at a young ladies’ school
should be ladylike herself. _Miss
Neal does not give this impression
with her loud and heavy voice and
blunt speech. The more pleasing
teacher is Priscilla Gillette ‘as

Debate Teams

Will H arangue
Far and Wide

According to Robert P. New-
man, assistant professor of speech,
Pitt debate teams will visit var-
ious civic and community groups
this year giving exhibitions and
publicizing the University.

Squads for the exhibitions have
been reduced from four to two
debaters each, pro and con. Thus
the‘ program will be more concen-
trated. The contest will ,:not be
judged, but rather will -be held
to gain experience for the icon-
testants.

According to Newman, the 13:2)-
gram -“gives them a chance to ap-
pear before adult groups who will

listen intelligently to what they

say.” |

Debators will argue on points
of interest to‘ the organizations. In
their first two debates held last
Wednesday, Oct. 7 and Tuesday,
Oct. 13, the Pitt teams— discussed

the direct election of the Presi-_

wooing the lligli schools

Page eight of today’s News carries a story about a new,

program for high school-University relations with students
- ', participating on the planning committee with the usual
/I : faculty and administration members. We like ‘to think that
_ '_,this is an attempt by the University to improve its contacts
with the schools who furnish Pitt with students and also to
’ ,'mproVe its relations with students already enrolled ‘here.

you will remember, the News carried an editorial column

_ ‘several issues ago that referred to the Un_iversity’s present
 H - system of" high school public relations inrather unﬂattering
» _terms and. suggested that ‘Pittites be given the chance to
' recruit from theschqols by personal visits and talks with
B ' the students preparing for college. Francis Pray, director
of the University's public ‘relations department,» answered

rthisgcolumn and stated that s

sidered. A

uch a plan was being con-

'I‘oday’s story veriﬁes this statement and. goes on to ex-
‘ plain some of the facts which must be considered in promot-
ingthe’ program and some of the preliminary work that
must be accomplished before such a plan could be effective. ~
At this stage of the‘ game it sounds presumptuous to~con-
gratulate the committee -and planners for their work» which T
has not even begun. But we feel-that they cannot -‘fail be-.
‘cause they dare not fail. Pitt has ﬁnally awakened to ‘the
fact that it must put its best foot forward in dealing with

prospective students; and if _its own students are not the .

 -/Un‘iversity’s best advertisement and .most inﬂuential sales-

men then the University must consider moving to the Carl- .

. ton‘ House and buying the Pittsburgh Steelers as added in-'
ducements for students to enroll here. In Western Pennsyl-
vania we have some of the most able. students in the country

A —-both, academically and athletically. There is no reason

; these, people instead 0
« to head them off.
We are in competition

 on earth why Pitt cannot attract and'hold a ‘majority of
f permitting other district colleges

with these other institutions and

_we ‘must compete actively and wisely if we’ are to stay in
the running. Giving our own students a chance to help. 1S

' , givin

them a share of responsibility and putting a certain

‘amount of f faithand truth in them. It also adds that per-
sonal touch to the otherwise businesslike proposition of
dragging in tuition-paying students in order to keep the
~.University going. Still, it is a business, and some anony.-
‘mous sage phrased it thus; When business is good it pays
to advertise; when business is bad you’ve got to advertise.”

An open letter to Christopher Columbus:
Dear Chris, . 1

Last Monday a few of us were sitting around
discussing the recent Tech Tartan “success” in
planting a Tech man in» Pitt classes and since
Monday was Columbus Day the conversation grad-
ually broadened to include you.

According to the Tartan it
isn’t very hard. to sneak an out-
sider into Pitt so we would like
to have you come and be our
guest for a week. We realize
~that a few hundred years can
make a big difference in clothes
and customs so-perhaps this let-
ter will give an idea of what to
expect.

First of all you will need ~ .
some new clothes. We don’t want to hurt your

feelings, but the clothes you wore on the “Santa”

Maria” would make you look conspicuous now. A
pair of white bucks," a‘blue jacket with crest, and
a pair of grey ﬂannels will make you look like
one of the crowdhere. You can alternate, between
these and a_sweatshirt—levil combination. As we
said before,, Chris, we just want you to look in-
conspicuous.  ‘ V '~

You’ll have to carry a few books around, too.
You can buy them new or if you have -enough
money you can buy them used. The library has
bool-Es, but\_they’re so touchy about which ones you
can take out that it’s easier to buy books.

Sooner or later someone will tell you about the
Tuck Shops and we think it would be better if we
were the ones. Brace yourself for the sight of a

p ln Anytime Chris  

 

   

large, overheated room filled with food—snatchirlg,_

boisterous typesof humanity apparently waiting; for

Clive of India to get them out of the hole.

If you happen to sit in one of the fraternity-

booths you willprobably be rushed. This means
' you will ‘be invited to a series of hayrides, parties,
and dances designed to show you the‘advantages
of one fraternity over another. If you like to shake
hands and learn the meaningless names of a‘ lot of
meaningless faces then this-is the place for you.
By staying around long enough you may even ﬁnd
out if they have a secret place to keep beer. Take
a .bit of advice and attend everything you' can.
The food may be lousy and the conversation dull,
but you might make some contacts. Remember,
Chris,/you had to have some contacts to get Isa-
bella to sell her jewels. ’

The women here might seem familiar to you be-

cause some of them have a savage look and use . _
paint and wear jangling bracelets. They’re a little

chubbier than savages, however, because they’re
overnourished and under-worked. Don’t under-
estimate the women, though. They’re shrewd opera-
"tors. Where ‘else but college could a girl invest
‘$2,000 to find and marry a man who has a po-
tential earning power of $15o',oo0? _ ‘
All of*your. time can’t be spent in‘ gadding
about, Chris. You must get some rest, so we have
arranged" a ‘class schedule for you. This will give

you an opportunity to sleep. If you: want to stayﬁ

awake that’s okay, too. Just don’t ask the in-

, structor any questions which may embarrass him. ‘

Comment on the weather or how low salaries are,

’ ' but keep away fromanything controversial. Think

it over, Chris, and if you can ﬁnd’ your way clear
(or even find your way) then come to. Pitt.‘

problem is: in tete a tete conver-

and not to look into the eyes at
all implies a disinterest in the
conversation or a certain shifti-
ness of manner. But which eye?

Or both? Should one look ﬁxedly,

into the left and ignore the right
eye of a person sitting on his
right and into the right and snub
the left eye of a person sitting on
his left? Or in-either case is it
better to be impartial and to shift
back and forth, dividing attentidn
between eyes?

Three Methods Tried

I have tried all three methods.
Use of the one—eye In e t h o d
(either right or left eye) for
longer than ﬁveminutes is fright-'
ening. After staring at one eye
for so long, a _friend, ‘relative or
acquaintance begins to‘ resemble
a member of that mythical race,
Cyclopes. The shifting-from-eye-

duction in streetcar fares—yes,
even similar to the type of passes
issued to high school students in
the city. And believe me, college
students have just as much if not
less money to‘ spend on transpor-
tation
leagues in the city supported
schools. They pay neither tuition,
the price of books and supplies,
nor living expenses which so
many of our out-of—tow‘ners must
struggle to do.
We're a Streetcar School
1We are all cognizant of Pitt’s
reputation of being a “streetcar
school” and I’d venture a guess

‘that more than 80% of students

here travel to school by Pitts-
burgh Railways. Excuses have
been given for poor attendanceat
night-time functions or late ‘aft-

ernoon, programs for just that

reason since, once Pittites return

home they find it difficult and “

time-consuming to come back.

How many more are going to ,

think twice before returning to
school when they feel for their
rapidly thinning Wallets? .1 will.

If the streetcar company would
recognize our situation as daily
commuters, possibly some ar-
_rangements cou1d._,be made. For

too. It is difﬁcult to concentrate‘

on the shifting without losing the

Look atpthe Eyes

I have tried avoid-ing the eyes
altogether,‘looking instead. at an.

The person becomes uneasy ‘and
touches the. stared-at-member,
wondering if there is a spot of
egg on his tie or if his "nose has
grown since he saw‘ it last. The
same results apply with ribbons,
jewelry and shoes. -It is wiser to
look at the eyes.

Perhaps there is some scientiﬁc ' B

solution. Maybe ‘if a personﬂis

provided both eyes. are of ‘equal

Three Would Benefit

In the long run three parties
would benefit: the streetcar com-
pany with comparatively more
passengers who would ride in the
evening and duringthe day; the
student whose ﬁnances-are usual-
ly strained; and the activities
program of the University. Then
“streetcar school” would retain"
an aiﬁrmative attitude since the
PRR would have ahand in pro-
moting student‘ activities.
it would make money too.

Pitt-AquaticPlaces Second   

In International

By CECY LINCOFF

Olympic Meet

Versatile Sophomore Sheldon (Skip) Monsein has added lthis international competition,
another notch to his record as one of the championship back-
stroke swimmers in the country. Just returned ‘from an olym-
pic contest in Israel, ’he_is the proud possessor of a second
place award received in competition with 27 other nations.

It all began when Skip was giv-¢

en support by some local business
men to ﬂy to Israel with 97 other
athletes as part of the United
States Maccabiah olympic team.

Four-Hour Daily Practice To
Get in.Trim

After a 36 hour trip, the swim-
mer reached his destination, a
camp for athletes on a_ cliff over-
hanging the Mediterranean Sea.
Five days later, Skip, as part of
the water sports participants,
journeyed to Haifa, where he
practiced for four hours daily get-
ting in trim for the bigmonient.

On‘the way back to the camp,“
the crew of 10 swimmers, eight
men and two women, took a dip in
Lake Tiberius to cool oﬁ from
the intense heat of over 100°.

Competition began for ‘Mon-
sein and the others on Sept. 29.-
After a few trial meets in the
morning, the pageantry for the
official opening of the contest be-
gan. '

Opening Spectacle Like
Norwegian Olympics

This spectacle is very similar to
that held on,the opening day of
the Olympics in Norway. The
torch ceremony and participants
parading in review touched off the
beginning of the long-awaited
event before acrowd of 60,000.

Near East Talk
By PC Editor
Set For Today

Andrew Chancellor, Post-Ga‘z—,
ette editorial writer, will speak,
of his recent trip to the Near East,

Wednesday,- Oct. 14, 7 p.m. at a ~

dinner in the Faculty Club. He
will be honored by the Syria-
Lebanon nationality room com-
mittee.

This program is the ﬁrst of sev-
eral to be sponsored by the na-
tionality room committees to in-
crease knowledge of various coun-
tries. _

Mr. Edward Lesoon, vice presi-
de_nt of the Syria-Lebanon com-
mit_tee, will serve as master of
ceremonies.

Friends of the‘ committee, fac-
ultyand students of Pitt are in-

vited to‘ attend. '

A few hours later with the
grace and ease of an experienced
aquatic, Skip took second place in
the backstroke. He broke a previ-
ous Maccabiah record by six
seconds, chalking up a l:l3:2. An-
other United States swimmer,
Bernie Kahn from Michigan,

broke the world Maccabiah rec-'

ord by establishing a 1:07:3 back-
stroke tally.

The 20 day trip was ﬁlled with
excitement of various kinds-—the
worl.d tour given to Skip en route,
contact with members of some 27
other nations including, Denmark,
South Af1~ica, Turkey, India, Chile,
and France, and finally the
knowledge of a job well done with
hope for future opportunities.

Blazer and Silver Medal Won

The tall .pre—law student, smil-
ingly commented, “I just hope
that I’ll be able to come back. in
1957.” _

In recognition for his part in

Skip received an ofﬁcial athletefs

blazer in addition to the silver
in ed a 1 won for outstanding
achievement. -

This step towards the top has I

been earned by many years of
hard work. In high school Skip
made a brilliant place for him-
self by rating as All American
swimming choice for two consecu-
tive ; years. At Schenley high

school, Skip was a credit to his‘
team placing for two years in the

state championships.
‘ After

cided to continue his career',at

Pitt where he is under the su-_

pervision of Coach Ben Grady.’

Skip has also had ten years er;-_

perience on the YM ‘&

PiKA Grabs Second Victory‘
With Whitewash Over Phi E ps.

By JOE MONTUORO ‘

Sparked by the passing arm of Dale Chovan, Pi Kappa‘

Alpha went on to their second win of thefseason by slam-y

ming down Phi Epsilon Pi, 25-O, Monday afternoon at Schen-

ley Oval.

r

The game was hard-fought and with PiKA in possession
of the ball in the fading minutes of the third quarter the

competition became bitter. 9

A, rough’ tag of a PiKA player
developed into trouble which in-
terrupted the game for ﬁve min,-
utes. However, peacewas restored
and play ‘resumed with a 15-yard
penalty. I W ‘

The game was relatively one-
sided with Choven hitting Jim
Fisher and Ron Kaiser for three
touchdowns. The other six point-
er was scored by hard—running
Don ,Mosites in the early minutes
of the second duarter.

By half time a well-balanced
PiKA team had surged in front,
12-0. The ﬁrst half had the Eps
resorting to free kicks in orderto
avert the onrushing PiKA’s. A

In; the third quarter the Epps
seemed to get a‘ new drive. After
a long kick by Choven, the Epps

put on a_ 50-yard drive which fea-
tured two completed‘ passes by
Schaer and; an end run by Al Ber-
ger. However the Epps werestopa
pedscold at the gates of the goal
when the PiKA’s defense stiffen’-
ed. This was the Epps’ only real
threat of the. game.

- The fourth quarter a saw the i A

Craig Streeters open up again.
Choven clicked with Kaiser in the
end zone and made the score 18-0;
Dale also scored theextra point.

Two plays‘ later Choven hit Jim.

Fisher, .who*swivel-hipped the rest
of the way and opened the gap to
25-9, the game’ ending score.

Other action at the oval Monday
saw a strong Delta Tauf..Delta
eleven, featured by well worked-
out running plays, defeat Sigma
Alph Epsilon, 30-6.~\.This was the
second win for the Delts while
SAE went down to defeat for the
second time._ “

Spy [Played Role
in Classic Upset

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor‘ ‘~ .

SQUASH AND BOWLING

Team squash and bowling
will get organized at a com-
bined managers meeting to be
held at Ellsworth Thursday,
Oct. 15.

Interested applicants are’
urged to attend, and Leo

 

When football talk gets around to the subject. of upSe_’CS,
seldom do the old timers fail to mention the classic surprise
of 1921, when an obscure Kentucky school called Centre
College went up to Harvard and shocked the dayhghts out
of the (then) kings of the grid world.. . _

But far more intriguing than the outcome itself is the
behind—the—scenes role of a spy in the story—and also the

. spy’s identity.

I

1

The spy, whom we shall call _Mr.. X, and who was a
dyed—in-the-wool Kentuckian studying law at Harvard that
year, wormed his way into the conﬁdence‘ of the Crimson

e players and coach. And through casual’ but shrewd observ-

ance, he suceweded in absorbing the plays that had kept Har-
vard undefeated for two seasons. . ‘
‘ 1 Only a Breather _ _
"When the Centre Squad of 13 strong—plus their gigantic
three—man band—-arrived in Cambridge that fateful day, they
held little hope of avenging the previous season’s walloping
at the hands of the mighty school which apparently had
scheduled, the series only to promote intersectional interest.
‘But that was before Mr. X handed over his complete
file of diagrams to the Praying Colonels from the_Blue Grass.
Bottled Attack 2
_ The conﬁdent attitude of the capacity crowd at Soldiers
Field changed abruptly soon, after play started. For the invad-
ersstopped the Ivy Leaguers’ offense cold from the start, and
kept them bottled up forthe day.
Led by Red Roberts and Bo McMillin, who lated became
a noted coach with the pros, the Kentucky lads befuddled
the Crimson with an unorthodox shiftiin their own offense

_ ' and tallied the only score of the game when McMillin broke
"Aoﬂf tackle for a. touchdown.

Mr. X had done a nice piece of espionage. He evidently
knew his football, for he landed the coaching job at Centre

 the next year. 

- e Sweet Music
From‘, then on, the power of the Ivy League began to
decline, after having repelled intersectional visitors handily

"for nearly a half century. ’
, Even the three Centre musicians latched ‘on to the band-.
wagon. «They signed up, three more members »whose Back

Bay‘accent« closely resembled their own, named the outﬁt
the Centre College Six, and made out so well" they never

. did get" back to Kentucky. *«

Mr. ‘X, whose part in-the plot enabled a college attended

 fewer than 300 students to pull an immortal upset over "

_a 10,000-man university, went into politics and wound up
as U. Se. senator.’ ‘ -

But sport fans know him better as the former commis-
sioner -of baseball, Albert ,“Happ"y” Chandler.

Oops, Wrong Nurhberl ‘’   is

 

A college student decided to add several new shirts to his
wardrobe. So one Saturday afterncion, he strolled into the

‘, local haberdashery store. “Let me see a few of those Van
Heusen Pan-Am Pique Shirts the whole campus is raving"
about,” he said. . ' .

"No wonder everyone is raving about Pan-Am Piques,”
said the clerk, laying several on the counter. "They’re smart,
comfortable, and come in Van I-Ieuse'n’s sensational new short
collar styles. What’s more, I have a complete line of smart
new collegiate colors-—as well as white. And they’re only $3.95.”

“I’ve never seen a smarter shirt,” admitted the student. “I’ll
take one in each color. And can I open a charge account?"

"Certainly," replied the clerk. “What is your name?”
“Size Six-and-Seven-Eighths Jones,” replied the student.
.f'size Six-and-Seven-Eighths Jones? What kind of a name
is that?”, asked the puzzled clerk. V - «
“Well, when I was born my folks didn’t know what to call
me,” he explained. “So they put a lot of names in a hat, and
by mistake my nearsighted father pulled out the size ticket!”

Pittsburgh scholars. ‘

_ Dr. 0: E. Jennings, director

Besides the technical informa-
tion onplants there is, in the'de-
scriptice text of “Wild Flowers,”
much informal comment on the
uses and wonder ofwild ﬂowers.
Volume I includes a summary of
the National History of the Upper
Ohio Basin, and 146 maps showing
areas in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West
‘Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and
New,York where some of the rar-
estjﬂowers grow. - "

Committee Plans
Public Relations

‘ A new program of Public‘Relations, with student par-
ticipation akey factor, is being planned by the Public Re-
lations Bureau under Francis Pray, director.

Mr. Pray announced that a High School Public Rela-
tions. Committee has been formed; as have sub-committees.
These committees are comprised‘v‘

illustrated vol-.

of administration, faculty officials,
and student leaders. ‘

Some committeemen are Theo-
dore W. Biddle, dean of men; J.
G. Quick, registrar; Helen P. Rush,
dean of women,’ and Pray. Stu-
dents on the committees are Don
Day, Men’s Council representative,
Clara Ortiz, WSGA, and Chester
Zulkowski from Student Congress.

- Cpmmittee Seeks Better
High’ School Relations

These people, according to Pray,

are seeking to ‘.‘alter high‘ school.
public relations that will help us
in the future.”
. At the present there are several
methods that are employed by the
University to attract prospective
college: students. A few are the
-Forensic League, and High School
Dayj Dr. Quick visits approxi-
mately 40 or 50 high schools each
year, talks to students and shows
them slides.

However, Pray feels that more
should be done to draw desirable
students to Pitt. And he contends
that the students at Pitt can help.

Student’ Aid ‘Essential

The idea of student participa-
tion in the Public Relations pro-
gram came“ from the students
themselves. The'y have asked sev-
eral times that they be permitted
to aid the program, Mr. Pray Said-

Saturday night’s program. Dec-

But “no plans are permanent and,

nothing is deﬁnite at this point,”
he warned.

“We are simply exploring the
possibilities forsuch -a program,
therefore nothing is deﬁnite,” he
said.

Trained Students Could Visit

. . . High Scl1ools- -

One plan of the committee is
to send groups of Pitt students to
the various high‘ ‘schools in the
district where they Would- speak
on aspects of social life here.

' But ﬁrst, teams of students must
be gtrained. “It would be‘ unwise
tosend the students out without
adequate preparation,” Pray ex-
plained. : « ,

Another factor is that the com-
mittee wants to learn why and
when students decide to go to
college and why they choose one
institution over a similar one. Dur-
ing this semester’s orientation pro-
gram Dean Biddleand Dean Rush
permitted questionnaires contain-
iﬁg theabove questions, to be dis-
tributed to thelfreshmen attending
orientation classes. These have yet
to be tabulated. ’
