sororities and fraternities working
along with the actives in an in-
formal atmosphere, according to
Susan Canter, Panhel president.

Headquarters for the project
are at the home of Dr. Alan C.

Study Declares Pgh. Needs

‘Unprecedented’ Revitalization

The Pittsburgh Planning Association, (PRPA) has just released
a study proving that the economic base of the six-county Pittsburgh
region is in an.unhealthy- state and shows every sign of worsening un-
less an immediate and “unprecented" revitalization program is de-
veloped and launched.

The study, written under the direction of Dr. Edgar M. Hoover,
took four years to compile. It is a realistic evaluation of Pittsburgh
and its neighboring counties, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Washington,
and Westmoreland. ‘

Dr. Hoover, professor of economics stated, “The Pittsburgh Reg-
ion has lagged increasingly behind the growth trends ‘of the United
States as a whole and those of the northeastern industrial heart of
the United States since World War I.”

The report singled out several ills of the Pittsburgh areanamong
them is that the population growth greatly trails the rate for similar
metropolitan areas. One possible reason for the population lag is the
result of migration of young people between the ages of -20-29, who
leave the Pittsburgh area to ﬁnd better opportunity elsewhere.

.Furthermore, the Pittsburgh region suffers from “chronic” un-

employment. The rate here is usually higher than the national aver-

age. A striking “deficiency" lies in the ﬁeld of education. Economists
found in a study of 24 cities that Pittsburgh ranked 17th from the
top in the median number of years of schooling attained by the

Union.

5. What is the role of the ad-

What is your evaluation of the

After these questions have been
presented, Dr. Martin will answer
questions brought up by the, stu-
dents. Miss Holstein “hopes ‘the
LA Cabinet will be present to an-
swer any questions directed to
them, or to talk to students who
are interested in their work.”

The idea of the Administrative
Coffee Hour series,‘ as expressed
by Mike Marcuse, is to provide a
means by which the student body
and the administration can com-
municate freely about problems‘
which are of importance to both.

At the two previous Administra-
tive Coffee Hours, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld and Miss Helen Poole
Rush, Dean of Students, answer-
ed questions brought up by the
students. Many of the problems
expressed have since been acted
upon. "

Miss Rush has been of great
assistance in the establishment of
a Kosher kitchen on campus for
the Jewish students. A committee
-has been formed to obtain facili-
ties for handicappedistudents. A
faculty committee has also been
formed for the problem of racial

Course on Nuclear

War, Arms Begins

The School of General Studies
will offer an informal course on
“Nuclear War and Arms Control,”
beginning Tuesday 8:15 p.m. in
151 CL. Informal courses are of-
fered without homework or cred-
its. Tuition for the eight classes
will be $12.

Physics professor Dr. Allen I.
Janis, one of the lecturers for
the course, hopes that “people
will obtain a better basis of
knowledge for the complex judg-
ments we are all expected to
make in the nuclear age.”

Lecturers will come from the
University’s physics and politi-
cal science departments. as well as

from Carnegie Tech and the local

civil defense office.

The large acceptance given
Men’s Dorm Council Dry Clean-
ing Service by Towers residents
has prompted MDC to extend the
service to female students be-
ginning Monday.

In announcing the move, MDC
President Pete Bijur noted that
“business has been booming.” He
added that hours have been
changed to include from 9 a.m.
to noon and 4 to 6 p.m. Monday
through Friday.-

The Dry Cleaning Service is
located in the former “Do-it-

of Tower B.

Bijur explained that special
rates comparable to those dele-
gated to male students also would
be afforded to female students.

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

If the New York Film Critics
awards for the best of 1963 are
to be used as a criteria, I would
unhesitatingly state that the 1963
Academy ’Awards show is going to
be quite tedious and monotonous.
Sans surprises, only two ﬁlms of
any note‘ will be mentioned
throughout the course of the eve-
ning’s proceedings and these ﬁlms
are “Tom Jones” and “Hud.”

During the Christmas vacation
the newspapers were on the
stands. This really isn't an oddity
except if you have a memory and
can remember last year’s’debacle

in New York City that was caused.

because "a few thousand workers
got smart and decided to strike.
There were no bests of 1962 so
this year we _were fortunate and
were ableito read all about those
ﬁlms and stars which iBosley
Crowther and company thought to
be ‘the cream of the crop of 1963.
All of the critics decided this had
been a ﬁne year for films in gen-
eral and an exceptional one for
actors. , .

The critics were almost unani-
mous in their selection. of the
best film of the year. The one
chosen was “Tom Jones,” star-
ring Albert Finney, directed by
Tony Richardson, and adapted

‘by John Osborne from Henry

' Fielding’s novel. You had‘ better
start lining up now ‘somewhere
in Squirrel Hill in order to avoid
the rush when the ﬁlm opens
next month. “Hud” ﬁnished in
second place and other films re-
ceiving mention were “Mad,
Mad World” and “Lilies of the
Field.” ,

In a very close contest for best
actor, the winner was Albert Fin-
ney over Paul Newman, Sidney
Poitier and Richard ‘Harris of
“This Sporting Life.” The actress
category saw Patricia Neal receive
eleven of the twelve votes for best
actress and copped the award on
the ﬁrst ballot. Leslie Caron, in
“The L-Shaped Room” ‘received
the other vote. ‘

Melvin Douglas, the father in
“Hud” won best supporting ac-
tor honors and to show just

award given for best support-

went to six ballots before de-
feating Martin Ritt, who direct-
ed “Hud.” And the best screen-
play was given to Irving Ra-
vetch and Harriet Frank for
“Hud.”. with John Osborne
finishing a very close second.

In keeping, with the "lack of
surprise evident from the other
selections the award to the best
foreign film went to “81/Q,” the
Fellini masterpiece that is well on
i"s way to becoming the most hon-
ored foreign-language film in the
history of motion pictures. There
is some speculation that this film
might even win the best film
“oscar” if it were entered against
the other English-speaking films.
This, however, will not take place
because “81é” has been chosen to
represent Italy in the foreign lan-
guage sweepstakes and.should win
in_a landslide. , E

/

West Virginia will be at Fitz-
gerald Field House again this
weekendseeking a victory; only
this time the Mounties try
theirluck on mats instead of the
hardwood. The meet is scheduled
for 2 p.m. tomorrow.

The Panthers haven’t met West Vire
ginia since’ 1956, when the Mountaineers
were trounced, 32-0.- The Panthers
haven’t lost to the Mounties since 1950,

the ﬁrst time the two squads met. West 1

Virginia is trailing 6-1 in the series.
The Mountaineers are bringing a re-

.spectable 6-1 record with them, how-

ever, the Southern conference is not
known for their top ﬂight wrestlers.

‘ Two dislocated elbows have made
the Mountaineers’ chance for a victory
slim. Don Check, a 123-pounder who

 

was 6-1 so far this season, and Bob
Gooden, a 147-pounder, who has com-
piled a 5-0-2 mark, will be lost to coach

,,Steve Harrick for the Panther match.

West Virginia’s best wrestler seems
to be Joe Jioio, at 157-pounds, who has
a 7-0 record and an impressive mark
of ﬁve pins in seven tries, a mark which
Crusher Lisowski would have trouble
beating. 1 A

Bill Woodeshick, bruising tackle on
the Mountaineer football team, will be
the starter at heavyweight, while Dave
Kane and Bill Walters will fill in for
the injured Check and Gooden, re-
spectively.

ed one victory and one loss for Coach

Army, the Panthers beat Maryland 15- 

9, last Tuesday night.

hue Killian at_J123-pounds

The big surprise in the Maryland
match was the use of Mike Johnson
at 137-pounds, and the use of Tom
Heniff at 130-pounds. Johnson

regular at 130 and Heniff was a regular
last year at 123.

Peery evidently felt the Terps were.

stronger at 137-pounds than at 130-

pounds. He therefore moved Johnson -

up and inserted Heniff in the lineup in
place of regular 137-pounder Clair
Riley. _ V
After winning‘ the ﬁrst four matches,
the Panthers only won one other match,
but their fast start was good enough to
give them the victory.

however. “We’ll need excellent performances in

 Junior , Varsity

 ‘Gets Cancelled

The junior varsity basketball

team traveled to Youngstown,

Ohio, ‘Monday

to meet the

Youngstown JV’s. The Panther

" .JV"s were after their fourth

straight win of the season but,
they never got it.

The team arrived in plenty of

time for the game and was warm-
ing up on the court when they

' were told that the game had been

cancelled. Youngstown had for-
gotten to inform anyone here of
‘the cancellation.

It was the second straight can-

cellation for the JV’s. They had

" been scheduled to play Washing-

ton & Jeﬁerson’s junior varsity
Jan. 14, but that game was can-
celled because of the big snow.

The schedule now calls forithe

junior varsity to be idle until
Feb. 5 when they play at Indiana

State College.

Indiana was an

easy victim of the Panthers ear-
lier in the season.

After the Indiana game the

JV’s play Robert Morris, Wash-
ington & Jefferson, Westminster

.and Carnegie Tech.

Volkswugens are now on the road all
