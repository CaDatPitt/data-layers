George, the friendly giant

A purebred mastiff with a love for Pitt competes in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. This is his story.

Contributing Editor

Most parents would worry if
their four-year-old weighed 210
pounds.

George’s parents are proud.
He’s indifferent.

“He’s huge, but we love him,”
Amy Coglio, George’s owner,
said. .

George is a purebred mastiff
who will turn 4 this Sunday. Amy
and her husband, John, bring
George to the Cathedral _of Learn-
ing to provide therapy for weary
students. ‘

George has become a ﬁxture

on campus. Students pose for
pictures with him. Amy said he’s
become quite a celebrity —,- ear-
lier this week, V
he competed in‘
the Westminster

Kennel Club Dog

Show.

Amy was
walking George
in the mall one
day when a girl
stopped and
said, “This must
be George. My
boyfriend goes
to Pitt and sent
me the picture.” ,

Other students ask Amy and

“We have towels in every room
of the house and carry them ev-

Despite his age, George is the
father of one mastiff in Ohio, one
in Michigan and six in the Pitts-
burgh area.

His show name is “American/
International Champion Erieside
Straight to Coalhill CGC TDIA.”

For dog owners who want to
show and breed, the American
Kennel Club requires a formal
name. Additionally, many kennels

Before last night there was only one Big

the road + Marquette.

After a 58-51 win in which four
Panthers scored 10 points each, Dixon
notched the only conference road win
thathad eludedhim.ItwasalsoPitt’sﬁrst
victory atthe Bradley Center, improving
its all—time record at the arena to 1-3.

The win makes Pitt 20-6, its ninth
consecutive 20-win season, and 9-4 in
the BigEast. Marquette, which came into
lastnightonaﬁve-gamewinningstreak,
falls to 16-9 and 7-6 in the conference.

Thanks tothe victory, Pitt remains
insole possession of fourth place inthe
BigEast. Thetop fourteams getadouble

The Panthers didn’t get much scor-

they did getwas evenly spread. _ y

-Starters Brad Wanamaker, Nasir

Dixon all scored 10 points each. Mar-
quette held the ﬁfth starter, Ashton
Gibbs, to a season-low two points on

but Marquette retook the lead early af- ‘

ter starting the second period on a 7-0
run. Pitt built back up its lead thanks
to Taylor, who scored six straight with
three consecutive dunks.

a 10-point lead at 54-44 — the biggest

‘We knew We needed to share him with others ’

George the mastiff earns international, local recognition in dog shows -— and works as a certified therapy dog.

George 4 1

hence “Erieside,” the name of
George’s original kennel in Ohio.
Coalhill is the name of the kennel
that John and Amy own.

“The CGC and TDIA abbre-
viations at the end of his name
stand for Canine Good Citizen
and Therapy Dog Internation-
al, Active,” Amy said. “CGC” is
a title George was awarded for
completing obedience training,
and “TDIA” signifies that he
passed an independent therapy
dog test. After completing 150
therapy visits, George’s title will
shift from “TDIA” to “TDIA-OV”,
which stands for “outstanding
volunteer.”

The TDIA testing is extensive
— to pass, George must not react
when separated from his owners
for three minutes. The first time
George took the test, he laid down
and fell asleep, passing the test.

After his ﬁrst birthday, George
began working as a therapy dog
at the Western Pennsylvania
School for the Blind, various
hospices around the area andat
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh
of UPMC.

“It was extremely difﬁcult to
get George approved to work at
Children’s — they put candidates
through extreme temperament
tests,” Amy said. According to
her, 95 percent of the dogs fail
the test required by Children’s
Hospital.

But not George. He remained
calm as an independent veteri-
narian pulled on his tail, yelled
at him and stuck him in isolation.
He now visits patients once or
twice a month during the school
year.

Lee Nesler, the executive di-

rector of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Humane Society, is familiar
with George as he’s taken training
classes at the Humane Society.

“Therapy dogs really‘ open
up [people’s] hearts to animals
 Any tension they have melts
away,” Nesler said. “George is
just so amazing. We’ll get people
who say they’re afraid of dogs,
but they’ll see his eyes, and after
ﬁve minutes, they can’t help but
pet him. He wins people over all
the time.” »

It didn’t take the Coglios
long to fall in love with George.
They’ve ownedlmastiffs since
1990, and they currently own
four. He eats 10-12 cups of dry
food a day, costing the Coglios
about $300 a month.

George goes for a 2—mile
walk around his Mt. Washing-
ton neighborhood with John on

sunny days. In his free time, he ’

enjoys laying his head on a pillow
and likes to suck on a blanket or
small toy, just like a baby would
on his paciﬁer.

Ask him if he’s happy, and“

he’ll bounce around a bit. He’s
not a huge fan of the snow be-
cause it’s hard for him to move
around. He’ll go outside, ‘turn
around and look back at Coglio as
if asking, “Are you gonna shovel
it or what?”

George has earned the right
to ask these sorts of questions.
In 2009, he was the No. 4-ranked
mastiff in the country. This title
gave him an automatic invitation
to this year’s Westminster Ken-
nel Club Dog Show at Madison
Square Garden in New York. He
was one of 2,500 dogs participat-
ing in the show, and he competed

against 30 other mastiffs from
around the country. _

On Monday and Tuesday,
George “stayed on bench” from 11
a.m. to 8 p.m. The show required
him to sit on display and show in
the ring in front of judges. _

“judges rule based on how
close he ﬁts the breed standard,”
Amy said.

George was eliminated after
the ﬁrst round.

“If you don’t get it, there’s
always another dog show,” Amy
said.

George the mastiff visits the Cathedral of Learning

Despite this loss,- George
is happy. Westminster was the
biggest show George has ever
attended. He’s won plenty of
national titles and local shows,
including an international best-
in-show award and more than 50
best-in—breed titles.

“He’ll be resting this weekend
and will be back to Pitt on Tues-
day,” Coglio said.

‘George got his ﬁrst taste of

of dogs from the Humane Society

Pitt film writers compete for prize

Tonyjovenitti
Staﬁ" Writer

This Weekend, the co-star of “Animal
House” will return home to Pitts-
burgh ' '

Jamie Widdoes, better known as
“Hoover,” the president of the Delta
House, is now aﬁlmrnaker and is cur-
rently directing CBS’s comedy “Two
and a Half Men.”

This Saturday, hewill come to Pitt’s
Alumni Hall to help ﬁnd the next great
Pittsburgh ﬁlmmaker.

The Steeltown Film Factory ﬁlm-
making competition has selected its

' ﬁve semiﬁnalists, and on Saturday’

they will meet at Alumni Hall for a
workshop titled “The Director’s Pitch:
Transforming Screenplays into Pro-
ductions.-” There, theywill pitch their
stories to Widdoes and two other
judges: Heide Waldbaum, production
manager for “Avatar” and Lisa Smith,
production consultant for “Project
Greenlight2.”

Widdoes said that he is excited
“at the opportunity, not only to come

_ back to Pittsburgh, but also to bring

more attention to the ﬁlm industry of

The Steeltown Film Factory was
organized byThe Steeltown Entertain-
ment Project, which was founded in
2003 whenPittsburgh nativesworking
professionallyintheﬁlmindustry held

_ the Steeltown Summit.

“[The competition] willgive people
an opportunity to learn from profes-
sionals,” said jodi Klebick, executive
director of the project.

The winner —‘ or winners, de-
pending on the talent level — will be
selected to receive or share $25,000
to produce their ﬁlms.

But there is one catch. The ﬁlms
must be produced in southwestern
Pennsylvania. The goal ofthe Steeltown
Film Factory is to not only help outlo-
caltalent, butto also create ﬁlmmaking
jobs. The competition began last fall,
when the Steeltown Entertainment

. Project asked community members

to participate, Klebick said.

1 Contestants submitted screen-
plays 10 to 12 pages in length. Forty
“entertainment professionals” judged

110 submissions and selected 10, she

said.
Late last month, Carnegie Mellon
hosted the ﬁrst Steeltown Film Fac-

re-an

tory event, where theater students per-
formed “scripted readings” of the 10
screenplays.Judges — including Geof-
ﬁ'ey Fletcher; who wrote “Precious”
.— gave feedback, and the contestants
took time to revise their screenplays.

. Now, after ﬁve semiﬁnalists pitch

their stories to the judges this week-
end, three will be selected as ﬁnalists.
They will meet at Point Park Univer-
sity on March 27 to discuss production
considerations. There, the winner or
winners will be selected.

Wednesday, the Steeltown Enter-
tainment Project announced the ﬁve
semiﬁnalists. '

Among them is Pitt alumnusjohn
Feightner. He graduated from Pitt in
2004withadeg_reeinﬁlmstudies.- He

every week and quickly found he had
a knack for comedy. He still attends
Friday Night Improv every week, and

he also joined a comedy troupe called '
-Hustlebot. A

“We mostly make movies and
sketch shows,” Feightner said.

Feightner said he didn’t have any
screenplaywritingplans when he came
to Pitt, but he attributes much of his
abilities to Friday Night Improv.

said. “Except you’re writing infront of

Krumm is also a Pitt alumnus. He graduated
in 2007 with a bachelor’s degree in ﬁlm studies.
He worked on UFIV making some short ﬁlms

Krumm’s script, “The Losing End,” follows an

Krumm said he’s a little nervous about the
prestige ofthe judgingpanel and expects to be “r —
ally nervous” right before he makes his pitch.

Neither Krumm’s nor any of the contestants’
screenplays have been read by Widdoes. Widdoes
was one of the 40 original judges and was asked
to judge six of the 110 submissions.

“We each used astandardized grading,”Wid-

O ini0ﬂ-S’-

Paying for miles
not gallons

0 many industries are tak-
S ing steps to “go green” as

concern for the environ-
ment grows increasingly preva-
lent. Automobiles —— perhaps the
most scorned culprit of environ-
mental decline —— are becoming
outfitted with new technology
that increase fuel efficiency and
shorten carbon tire tracks. Better
fuel efficiency means less time
spent ﬁlling up at the pump,

which means less tax collected

on gasoline. «

When the federal govern-
ment wants more money, it of-
ten means increasing a tax some-

, where along the line. While gas '
V prices have diminished from

their spike in 2008, the aver-
age price for a regular gallon of
gasoline for U.S. drivers reached
greater than $4 in the summer
of 2008 — increasing the.price
of gas would surely cause more
than a few unhappy motorists.
With that said, the federal gas tax
has remained at 18.3 cents per
gallon since 1993, according to
the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.
Individual states, of course, also

charge a determined tax rate.

A recent RAND Corp. study
looked at an alternative way to
tax motorists, a way that might
still not be popular but could be
more effective. Instead of tax-
ing per gallon of gasoline, the

government would tax per mile

driven. A blanket ‘policy would
mean everyday drivers would be

taxed the same as, say, commer- ‘

cial trucking companies. Still,
thisinew way of taxing could offer
advantages than the traditional
per-gallon gas tax. 8

To measure the tax, the fuel
consumed would be multiplied
by the vehi_cle’s fuel efficiency to
get an estimate of miles traveled.
To do so, however, vehicles would

need GPS units installed to deter- 3

mine range of travel —— a measure
that would be initially expensive
but could pay off with time. More
suspicious drivers might not like
the thought of a GPS in their ve-
hicle, but would such a device be
much different than the common
0nStar function in GM cars?
The study found that a tax of
1.1 cents per mile could generate
an estimated $35 billion in a year.
In 2006, the revenue from the

federal gas tax amounted to $31.4 '

billion, according to transpor-
tationfortomorrow.org. But the
new tax could be more ﬂexible
than a ﬂat-rate gas tax. The-rate
could be increased for drivers in
certain areas during peak traf-
fic hours ‘to potentially allevi-
ate headac;he—in_ducing roadway

congestion.

Consumers now have the‘op—
tion of buying hybrid cars and
vehicles that rank better than
ever in fuel efficiency. While

there could be less incentive to ’

buy more ecologically friendly
vehicles if the tax were basedon
distance driven, every driver will
have a very direct incentive to
limit his driving. Fewer cars on
the road means a smaller impact

_ on the environment and lessewear

and tear on roads. The govern-
ment could also considerf‘low-
ering theper-mile fee for more
fuel- efficient vehicles in order to
keep them attractive to buyers.
The money used’ by theéafuel

tax goes in part toward roadlcon-;’

struction and maintenance. But
factoring in inflation and newer,
more fuel-efficient vehicles, the
gas tax has decreased in value.
There will never be a popular
solutioniwhen it comes to the

. government asking-.s;,for riiiore

money, but this sol” "tion- oléfers

Some Unconventional Wisdom  

Expand beer availability

Distributor locations are too inconvenient -- let’s put beer in grocery stores.

 
  

Jacob Brown
Columnist

Gettinga case ofbeer is never as easy
as walking down the street —- it in-
volvesmuch more strategy. If ﬁnd-
ing the few distributors’ locations
isn’t confusing enough, it seems like
many of them are never open when
you want them to be, either.

During Snowpocalypse, Imarched
through the heaps of snow to the only
distributor within two miles to ﬁnd
out it was closed. The only option
was to go to a bar and overpay for
a six-pack instead. I wasn’t about to
do that. '

. ButI don’ttl1ink I’m the only per— ‘

son to have ever experienced such a

» dilemma. Judging from a new piece
of legislation, our.lawmakers might

feel the same way.
State Sen.John Rafferty recently
introduced. legislation that would

V allow convenience stores and gro- 3

 

.«y.-  .4 '

cers the opportunity to sell beer. If
passed, it would replace beer distri-
bution laws that date back to the end
of Prohibition in 1933.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, some politicians are con-
cerned about backlash from Mothers
Against Drunk Driving. But as a na-
tive Ohioan who has lived with laws
similar to those proposed, I feel safe
in saying that opening more loca-
tions for beer sales wouldn’t create a
widespread moral decay or damage
the population’s wellbeing.

Beer distributors have expressed
their disapproval with the legislation,
though. As grocery stores and gas
stations abound, distributors believe
the competition could hamper busi-
ness. ' '

David Shipula, the president of I
3 the Malt Beverage Distributors As-

sociation of Pemisylvania, wants to
maintain the current law. He sug-
gested that the Wal-Mart stores of
the world would put some of the
450 distributors he represents out

  
 

MCT Campus

of business.

Changing the law might surely
close some distributors, unless they
‘make their business practices more
relevant in the marketplace. But I

' wouldn’t go blaming the ghost of Sam

Walton for anything just yet.
Competition is what drives the
U.S. economy. Promoting it is the only
power consumers have in the mar-
ketplace, forcing businesses to put
an emphasis on meeting customer
needs and providing value. ,
While scanning the beer aisle at
an Ohio Wal-Mart at midnight over
winter break, I was taken aback by
how much cheaper the prices were
compared to distributors’ here.
Shipula also said he thinks that
including larger stores within the
guidelines would result in more un-
derage beer purchases. However,
under Raﬁ'erty’s ‘proposal, the law
would mandate that people of all ages
be carded.
The law would be no less enforce-
able at a Giant Eagle than it would be

For 77 years, the state and its distributors ,

have kept a stranglehold on the market. The
state didn’t even allow Sunday beer sales until
2005. The distributors are holding on as hard
as they can to keep their proﬁtable product
exclusive.

In Ohio, we have independent non-grocer
distributors that thrive despite ﬁerce beer-
market competition from grocers because
distributors exclusively sell liquors greater than
42 proof. Many are also licensed to sell tobacco
products, too.

Here, distributors are sandwiched so that
they can’t sell anything but beer in cases or
kegs. Hopefully ifthis law passes, packaging

. restrictions would open up for distributors so

they could sell six— and 12-packs, too.

But I’m not holding my breath, even with a
Republican-controlled State Senate that should
be in support of the bill. The strong-lobbying
distributors association has fought Sheetz in
the state Supreme Court over the tonvenience
store’s distribution of six—packs, and the as-
sociation won. Now, it’s going after Wegmans
grocery stores.‘ - ,

With politicians wanting to advance capi-
talism and businesspeople wanting to hold it
back, it makes for an odd juxtaposition. But
that could be because the politicians are trying

a to do what’s right for once.

Strapped with a state budget that is currently
off $525 million from its yearly budget projec-
tions and with the 2011 budget to be propped up
by $2.76 billion in stimulus funding, it’s evident
that the state cash ﬂow is drying up.

' So instead ofwaitingfortheworst, me state '

is trying to open up new sources where it can
allow beer sales to drive in more tax revenue,
as well as amend laws that were designed by
fear—mongering politicians 77 years ago. So to
Rafferty and the Senate, I lift my mug to you. ,

ALBUM PREVIEW

Woman behind the ‘Actor’ plays in ’Burgh

Songwriter Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent, performs the music from her new album on Sunday.

< Kelsey Shea
Assistant A8-E Editor

When most people watch “Snow
White,” they see a princess, a
prince, some woodland crea-
tures, a tainted apple and a some
dwarves. When the movie is over,
they get up, start thinking about
theirhomework and make them-
selves a sandwich.

However, when Annie. Clark,
better known as St. Vincent,
watches an old Disney movie, she
doesn’t make sandwiches when

' she’s done — she makes music
— and that’s how her sophomore A

album Actor came to be.

You can hear hints of fairytale-
appropriate whims in the ethereal
and whimsical album that Clark is
now taking on tour and will per-
form in Pittsburgh on Sunday.

The process of writing the
album was just as unique as the
inspiration for the Tulsa-born
singer-songwriter.

In her New York apartment,
high noise levels weren’t an op-
tion with neighbors just on the

* other side of a wall, so Clark used

her computer and Garage Band to
score out what would soon be her
new album.

“It was an interesting process

because I‘ wasn’_t necessarily rely-

ing on my motor skills and hand
coordination,” Clark said. “I was
more watching old Disney movies
from the ’30s and ’40s and sort of
trying to re-score them and re-
conceptualize them, and really the

only tools at my disposal were a '

computer and a mouse and my ears
and the ﬁlms.“
Actorhas come a long way since

' classic Disney movies inspired-

Clark. The 27-year-old rising indie
star has since replaced the digital
scores with her own instrumen-
tals, recorded the album and taken
it on tour. To reiterate, she’s in
Pittsburgh this Sunday!

Having opened up on tours for
The National, Grizzly Bear, Arcade

. Fire, Andrew Bird, John Vander-

slice and Death Cab for Cutie,
touring is nothing new for Clark.
There is something special about

' this one, though — it is the ﬁrst

major U.S.,tour where St. Vincent
has been the headlining act, and‘
she said so far it’s been a great
experience. 1

“You get to bring your own light
show and really have the whole
night geared toward your own ex-
perience. It’s more work, but it’s
more fun, and it’s more gratifying,
too,” Clark said, adding that it’s
the fans that have made it really
great. ‘ .

For fans to feel as connected

to Clark as she feels to them, is
hardly surprising. As an avid Twit-
ter user, blogger and backstage-
video poster, getting to know Clark
outside of her music is anything
but tough.

“I think that in the olden days

there was a lot of mystery about ,

the artists that you like, and I think
that that mystery is way more dif-
ﬁcult to maintain now,” she said.
“And I thin‘k that that’s OK. I think

. what a lot of times fans want and

is now expected is to not just like
a band’s music but also feel a_ per-
sonal connection to their artist
of choice.” _ ' - ~ ,

It’s not just the fans that Clark

connects with, either. She’s played I

in Suﬁjian Steven and The Poly-
phonic Spree’s bands and has re-
cently added recording with The
New Pornographers to her musical
resume. As a long—time Neko Case
fan, she said it’s an honor to work
with such talented artists.

“For me, it’s all about getting to
play music on my own and also play
music with other bands and artists
who I really admire, so I’ve gotten
that opportunity,” Clark said. “It

. feels very exciting and very gratify-

ing to beamong other artists who
I respect and admire.” ~

What’s next for Clark, now that
she’s sitting on top of the indie
scene looking forward‘?

 

Annie Clark looks onward at the rising sun of her new popular album,

which she will perform at Diesel on Sunday at 6 pm.

Clark isn’t really sure speciﬁ-
cally what’s next for her, but it
probably includes another album
and maybe more touring. She does

know that there will be “lots of
music in a lot of different ways”
— something we can all thank the
saints for.

Harold Keller plays a ranting woman on PCTV’s ‘Traci the Trailer Trash Girl.’

p Kelsey Shea
AssistantA&E Editor

Most mornings when Harold Keller
wakes up, he puts his pants on one
leg at a time justlike any other up-
standing citizen.

But once a month, Keller dons
a black dress, black pantyhose,
maryjane shoes, a long blonde
wig and about a pound of blue eye
shadow to become Traci -_— the
main character on his PCTV televi-

' sion show, “Traci the Trailer Trash
j Girl.”«

He describes his character
as a “foul—m'outhed, mean drag
queen.” A _

Keller, a 56-year-old Beechview
resident, might seem. like just an
average unemployed middle-aged
man to his neighbors, but'his mid-

- night public cable show is making

waves throughout Pittsburgh.

The premise of the show is Traci‘
standing outside her trailer and
yelling in her abrasive and crackly
voice about city council, the presi-

dent, her boyfriends and sex, all‘

without any preplanned dialogue

cc  

or even a script.

“I just say whatever I feel, and '

I go crazy for an hour,” he said.
“It’s not liberal or conservative. I

I just say whatever I feel, and I
go crazy for an hour.

Harold Keller

7Ti:ash’ on TV: Actordumps his thoughts

usually throw in some trivia about
football and baseball and classic
TV.” .

Keller’s rants are peppered
with some heavy Pittsburghese
and what seems like an endless
flow of profanity and obscene
statements.

“I just want to do my thing and
be uncensored,” said Keller, which
makes PCTV an appropriate home
for his show. “The station has nev-
er told me there was something I
couldn’t say.” ,

Enter Chatroulette, the latest -
and creepiest —— phenomenon to hit
the Internet since 'I‘witter allowed us
to know when celebrities were using
the toilet.

Though itwas createdinNovember
2009, by 17-year old Russian Andrey
Temovskiy, according to The New York
Times online blog,.it has only gained
popularity in the past few weeks after
being featured in a “Good Morning

. America” segment. -

The site works like this: You go to

. you appear to them via yours. Creepy

enough, yet‘? Oh, just wait.

If you don’t like your total stranger
video encounter, a simple hit of the
F9 button will send you on to the next

est and most utterly ridiculous way to
insult someone.

Of course, you could strike up a gen-
uine, deep conversation with someone

(very doub1ful),butmore oftenthannot .

you’ll end up laughing at the awkward-

across your ﬁrst penis, of course.

As can be expected with any social
web tool that connects you — Visually!
—with total strangers, you can expect
to ﬁnd some perverts, and they come
fast and frequently on Chatroulette.

Inapersonal experiment of mine,I
decided to endure Chatroulette for ﬁve
uninterrupted minutes (by myself %
I don’t recommend it), cycle through
strangers every ﬁve seconds and see
what would happen. _

through, I saw 23 derivations of a pe-
nis, someone playing with his penis,
and in one ‘case, someone screaming
“PENIS” at the top of his microphone-
volume lungs. I also saw two very cute
girls, a “Jersey Shore” cast member
look—alike pounding a beer, a woman
holdingwho I presumed was her infant
son and four empty screens of vacant
rooms. Seriously, though, 38 percent

of my Chatroulette experience was ,

random penis.

The creepiness speaks for itself,
and the site obviously presents itself
as a severe issue when it comes to rni—

nors and what seems like unintended
instances of corruption as well as the
possibility of indecent exposure. The
thing is, by now, you implicitly agree
to being exposed to those possibilities
when you use the site. A

Althoughl ampersonally disgusted
by the site andwill only use itfrom now
on in the company of friends and alco-
hol, it is undoubtedly a phenomenon.
Youwant proof? Paris Hilton has been
on it (as evidenced by her Twitter), and
many other users have tweeted about
alleged ce1ebrity—Chatroullete encoun-
ters. '

  
 
  
 
 
 

Is this the new 'I‘witter? The new
AOL chatroom? The new Craigslist?
The new poster child for Megan’s Law
offenders? All of the above?

It’s a little too early to tell, as .
the site is still riding the bell-
curve wave of popularity. Give
it a month, an update that ﬁl-
ters whether you get the un-
expected male nudity and get
back to me.

Ifyou do happen to see me
on the site, say “Hi.” I prom-
ise Iwon’t F9 you — as long
as you have your clothes on.

character. Keller said that he has a femi-
nine side and that Traci is a way for ‘him to
express that.

“Traci lets me act in that feminine way
that I couldn’t display in public,” said
Keller. ,

According to Keller, people either love
his show or hate it. He believes that younger

people ﬁnd it funny whereas others ﬁnd it
“weird, bizarre, crass andalarming.” .
The crass nature of the late—night show,

' on a TV station that also hosts religious pro-

grams and children’s shows, upsets some
Pittsburghers. ,

“I think Harold wants to offend people,
and I really think he succeeds in doing that,”
said Patterson. .

“City Councilwoman Darlene Harris said
she was going to look into my show, but she
can’t do anything about it,” said Keller.

Keller’s character responded by calling
Harris, “an ugly old hag” and continually
used the f—word to parody the situation,
on one episode of “Traci the Trailer Trash
Girl.”

"Referring to the show, Harris said, “I
don’t even know what the name of this is.”

She said she planned to look ‘into the
content of some public programs but did

not know the speciﬁcs or names of the pro- 0

grams.
a But Keller doesn’t always agree with his
on—air identity. He doesn’t wish the subjects

. ~of Traci’s ranting monologues any sort of

real harm.

“Really, I wouldn’t want to hurt Darlene
Harris or really turn her into sh*t or poopy
dirt,” said Keller. .

But despite the controversy,‘ inthe end

_ Keller isn’t really too worried about what

people say about Traci.. _

“I’m satisﬁed either way, whether people
like it or hate it. As long as people are watch-
ing.” ‘

MEN'S BASKETBALL S

Pitt to take on former Elite Eigh

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

Panther fans will see an unfortu-l

nately familiar face this Sunday when
the Pitt men’s basketball team hosts
No. 3 Villanova. _

The matchup is the ﬁrst meet-

ing of the teams since they faced off '

in last year’s Elite Eight when Vil-
lanova beat Pitt 78-76.‘ Both teams,
however, will lookfairly different this
weekend. .

Villanova (22-3, 11-2 Big East)

. returns just two starters — Scottie

Reynolds and ‘Reggie Redding. The
Panthers return just one starter from
that game,_]ermaine Dixon.

The Wildcats won the game
thanks to a Reynolds driving lay-
in with two seconds remaining.
While the image of Reynolds racing
downcourt and ending Pitt’s season
might still sting the eyes of Panther
fans, they’ll surely see alot of him on
Sunday. Reynolds leads Villanova in
minutes per game (29.6). The senior
is also ﬁfth in the Big East in points
per game, averaging a career-best
18.9 points per contest.

This "time around, though, the
Panthers won’t have to-worry about
frontcourt players like Dante Cun-
ningham and Dwayne Anderson,
who put up acombined 31 points and

11 rebounds in last year’s Elite Eight
game, as both players were seniors
last year. ' .

This year, Villanova’s leading big
man is 6—foot—8 Antonio Pena, who

averages 11 points and 7.5 rebounds .
7 a game.

Villanova plays a small lineup,
with Pena its tallest starter. The Wild-
cats playanextremely up—tempo style
of play and lead the conference in
points per game (85) and free throw
percentage (75.8 percent). They’re
fourth in ﬁeld goal percentage (46.7
percent) and ﬁfth in 3-point percent-
age (37.5)- '

(Cm-

Villanova (22—3,
11-2 Big East)
returns just two
starters.

While Villanova isn’t the tallest

team, it is also third in the Big East

in rebounding margin, averaging 6.5
more rebounds than its opponents. It

, is, however, also 14th in the 16-team

conference in scoring defense, giving

up 73 points per game. The Panthers

average 69 points per game.
9 The Panthers will mostly likely‘

look to slow down the Wildcats and

, force them to play a more controlled

half-court style. But if Pitt plans to try
running with Villanova, it couldbe
a big afternoon for Dixon and Brad
Wanamaker, both who are quite good
at cutting and driving to the hoop. If
those two drive to the hoop enough,
they might force Villanova defend-
ers to help in the paint, potentially
opening up the perimeter for Ashton
Gibbs. ' '

It could also be a big game for

S the very quick and agile point guard

Travon Woodall, who had arguably
his best game as a Panther in Pitt’s
come-from-behind triple-overtime
win against West Virginia. In the vic-
tory, the redshirt freshman scored 12
points, pulled down seven rebounds
and dished out six assists.
Since.Villanova is coming off a

- 84-75 loss to Connecticut on Monday,

the Wildcats will surely drop in next

I week’s rankings. Still, they will be
. ranked third when they come to the

Petersen Events Center on Sunday.
Since the Panthers started playing
there in 2002, Pitt is 5-0 all—time
against top -ﬁve ranked teams.

And at noon on Sunday, the Pan-
thers will look to keep that record
unblemished.

Women look for fourth conference win~

After defeating two Big East opponents, mé Pitt women’s basketball team hopes to add to its streak against Seton Hall.

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

I While the Panthers (14-11, 3-9 Big

East) have certainly struggled in
conference competition, their
recent two-game win streak has
proven apositive step.
Alternatively, the Seton Hall
Pirates (9-16, 1-11 Big East) have
been unable to respond to the in-
tense level that characterizes Big

S East women’s basketball and post

only one conference victory. '

Pitt hosts Seton Hall on Satur-
day as both teams are desperately

V seeking a win to help move farther

from the Big East basement.
The Panthers, coming off vic-

’ tories against Louisville and Vil-
' lanova, look to their recfent out-

break of balanced scoring to spark
offensive production.

' In the Louisville contest, Brit-
taney Thomas,Jania Sims and.Ta-
neisha Harrison all contributed
double—digit scoring performanc-
es in the Panthers’ 72-69 win.

An even more impressive dis-

1

play of scoring distribution took

. placeagainst Villanova as ﬁve

Panthers scored more than 10

S points, with two players earning

double-doubles.

Thomas and Harrison once
again reached the double-digit
mark and were joined by Shawnice

,“Pepper” Wilson as well.

Shayla Scott led the Panthers
with 18 points and 11 rebounds
while Chelsea Cole ﬁnished the

game with 15 points and a game-

high 16 boards.
Cole now ranks as the second

rebounder in the Big "East while
holding the top position as the

offensive rebounding leader with

four such boards per game.

‘ The Pirates’ sole Big East win
came against Villanova on Jan.
30, and since that game Seton
Hall has dropped its last t_hre_e
contests. .

Part of Seton Hall’s hardships
has come in the offensive depart-

’ ment,.as the Pirates hold the con-

ference lows in ﬁeld goal percent-
age and points per game, at 33.6
percent and 51.6, respectively.

Despite these dismal ﬁgures ogg’

the offensive,sophomore Kandice
Green poses a scoring threat as
she leads Seton Hall with an aver-
age of 13.5 points per game.

Junior Ebonie Williams also
contributes to Seton Hall’s scor-
ing from behind the arc with 2.2!
long-range baskets per game, the
second most in the Big East.

Williams recently became the
19th player in Seton Hall’s his-
tory to reach the 1,000-point
mark and now sits at number 1;,
in school scoring totals.

ANALYSIS

  Flipped forecasts: Big East a jarring reality

February 19, 2010 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittneWs.com

Recently the conference has become a fortune chest of chance for former underdogs.

Randy Lieberman
Senior Stajf Writer

J‘;

Holy upset, Batman! Itake one week
off, and all hell breaks loose in Big
‘East basketball.

Four of the top-ﬁve teams in the
Big East standings lost last week.
That means with more upsets bound
to happen, major shifts will occur
before teams sniff the Big East cham-
pionship coming on March 9.

Now, every matchup is huge
leading up to the postseason tour-

gnament. Unless an implosion for

“the ages happens, Syracuse and Vil-
lanova look safe atop the Big East
standings. At 11-2 in conference play,
they’ll be sure to get double byes in
the Big East championship.

The outlook gets a lot more un-
clear after those two. West Virginia
(9-4), Pitt (8-4), Georgetown (8-5),

place. The difference between fourth
and ﬁfth in the Big East is an extra
day of rest come championship
time.

Evenlsome middle and lower
teams, such as South Florida, Seton
Hall, Cincinnati and Connecticut are
ﬁghting to get wins before the NCAA
Tournament Selection Committee
makes its picks.

It’s simple — every matchup is
now much more important.

This is one of the best times to
follow Big East basketball. Every year
the late—season upsets always spark
debates on the depth of the confer-
ence. For my money, the fact that
basement teams such as Rutgers and
Connecticut can beat top-10 teams is
a testament to the league’s strength
at the bottom, not its puniness at
the top. .

Take Louisville for instance,
which nobody wants to play right

  

they dispatched Syracuse 66-60 on
the road and survived at Notre Dame
in double overtime with a 91-89 vic-

' tory Wednesday.

Louisville’s amazing turnaround,
from a 4-4 Big East record and a

now much more
important. '

19-point blasting by St. John’s last '

Thursday night, is incredible. Once

isville was forgotten once it started

could tussle with any team in th
country. ’ »
Tip-Ins:
This space is usually devoted

to quick bits around the Big East.‘

Instead, I’ll digress for once. NBC
shouldn’t have showed the tragic
death of Georgian luger Nodar Ku-
maritashvili during its Vancouver
Winter Olympics coverage. My jaw

hit the ﬂoor when NBC decided to ~

open Friday’s Olympics coverage
‘with the video of Kumaritashvili’s
horriﬁc crash; Showing a man
launching oil‘ a1 track travelling 90
mph andﬁstriking an unprotected

 steel beam is not good television.

In NBC’s defense, Brian Williams
did warn viewers that “the pictures
are very tough for some people to
watch.” Thatwas before NBC showed
the video in slow motion, pictures
of Kumaritashvili’s bloody corpse
and then the video two more times.

repeated until the shock value forces
us to watch the Olympics.

Back to basketball, how did Notre
Dame replace senior Luke Haran-
gody and his 24.1 points per game
against Louisville? Notre Dame
caught ﬁre from the perimeter and
got balanced scoringfrom typically
unproductive sources. The Irish shot
percent from behind the are as a
team. Againstthe Cardinals, junior
Tim Abromaitis chipped in 29, just
two shy of his season high. Usually
a passer, senior Toryjackson also
added 19 points for the Irish. Just
imagine if they all score this way
once Harangody comes back.

Postseason big incentive

Pitt hopes for 3 straight wins to increase selection chances.

Seton Hall 4 11

Diana Connor-I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
. Shawnice Wilson andthe Panthers started slow in Big East play but won their last two.

The Panthers have not pieced together
a three-game win streak since they began
the season with eight consecutive noncon-
ference victories. H

With postseason tournament play in
question, the Panthers enter the contest
against Seton Hall with a must—win men-
tality: A ' .

According to Pitt coach Agnus Berenato,
there is little margin for error left for the

Panthers who face exclusion from the NCAA
Tournament. '

“In the Big East, if you win around 18
or 19 games, then you are in [the Tourna-
ment],” Berenato said.

With 14 wins and four games remaining
in regular season play, the Panthers will
need to continue their recent winning ways,
beginning against Seton Hall on Saturday at
2 p.m. at the Petersen Events Center.

Many teams vie for spots

Lieberman < 12

Rutgers — Consecutive wins against George-

town and'DePaul could have saved the job of ‘

Scarlet Knights coach Fred Hill. It might not

belong before he eventually loses his job, but

you have to respect a team‘ for playing that
' hard for their coach.

Big East Matchups to Watch:

Villanova at Pitt, Sunday: Pitt is back home
for the Wildcats, who return after a stunning
loss to Connecticut. The overall theme of tl1is
one will be which team forces the other into
its game. Will Pitt rely on post players to play
a half-court game, or will Villanova force the
Panthers to run with them and play at afaster
tempo. '

No. .6 West Virginia at Connecticut, Mon-

day: The wildly inconsistent Huskies are des-
perate for awin. West Virginia is on upset alert
inthis one because it’s on the road and against
ateam needingawin. -

Who’s Hot: ~ 

Ashton Gibbs, Pitt — Gibbs averaged 22.0
points and ﬁve P3-point ﬁeld goals per game in
Pitt’s 2-0 week. He scored 24 points, including
the tying 3—pointer inregulation, in a 98-95
triple-overtime win against West Virginia.

Who’s Cold: :

Notre Dame — Consecutive losses to St.
John’s and Louisville hurt. So does not having
Harangody in the lineup. He’s expected to
come back for the team’s home game against
Pitt.’ f
