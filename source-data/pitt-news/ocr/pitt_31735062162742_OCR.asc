Spring Festival

A plan for Spring, Carnival
which will make use of ...l1 indoor
campus facilities has been pro-
posed by Chuck Isler, Appoint-
ments chairman for SGA. ‘~

The suggested plan consists‘ of
setting up two stages in the SU
Ballroom and two in the Com‘-
mons Room for the presentation of’
shows. .

\ Student-formed jazz c o m b o s
would perform in the lobbies of
the Student Union. The Pine Room
would be used as an ‘Expresso
Shop. ' / - '

Plans for booths and other rem-
nants of past Spring Carnivals
have not been formulated, ‘but if
student support is_ given to this
plan, provisions. will be made for
these. ‘ '

Isler stressed that this plan"
would enable -more participation
- by those groups and individuals

not in fraternities" and sororities. -

Tickets for the affair will be
sold in book form for arset fee.
The proﬁts will be distributed on a
percentage basis. A

Isler. stated that he feels that 'if
is the responsibility of all students
to. offer "their opinion on the plan
and to give further suggestions.

SGA‘_is interested in ﬁnding p
out the opinion of students on ‘
the above idea. They ask that

he must pay an increased price for a produ’c\t is one of op-
jﬁposition, and complaint. Students’ reaction to the announce-
,_.in_-ient on Monday that they will have to pay $5 a credit more
for their tuition beginning ‘next September should not be
; expected to be any different from this general attitude.
 ‘":After this initial reaction, however, common sense
Lshould prevail, thus enabling the students ‘to look, at the
fraise objectively. If they do this, they must come tofthe
,:conclusion that the tuition increase was ,one_of necessity
,.;.and” should be accepted without muchgrumbling. I

 4' We believe. that the great majority of students event-
~.ually will arrive at the above conclusion, that’a1though no
=..,'o_ne ‘likes to pay more money, a raise is necessary in this
; instance. This idea is brought out somewhat in the, views
presented by students in the story on page one. ,
_ Various reasons were given by Chancellor Litchﬁeld as
'--‘to’ why the increase had toobe made. We do not have to re-
jpeait these. We will say, however, these reasons and other
facts concerning the financial, status of the university (some
of which will be presented graphically in next Monday’s
jpaper) prove to our satisfaction thatthe tuition increase
3 is justiﬁed. - V ‘ -

‘"7 " Perhaps the most common complaint among’ students
7}-7’abo'ut. greater costs and quality of education is that the latter
i.'i‘gioes"not justify" the former. ‘ In years past. and to a lesser
1-;d‘eigree at this stage in the university’s _de,velop:">n_t, this
:'argument could be valid. '_ - i V -' . . " ' " j

— By Jim Vaughan
During these last three years we have seen
Pitt undergo many ' impressive, worthwhile im-

-provements in its quest for a high place among

American . universities. , ,
This growth has already cost millions-of dol-
lars,,and'will cost many millions .
more if our aspirations are ever
to materialize‘. _
Realizing this, our oﬁicials 

living.” In brief, itzmeans that T
they are raising the needed
money from all possible sources.
In pursuing this policy, however,
the administration has either’ ig-
nored or failed to see the ‘un-
pleasant atmosphere they have .
created among students.‘ I ‘ _

A great deal about Pitt sings out a tunewhere
the accent is on .money, not education". Agfew
examples: " _ -

Dormitory students must buy a $250 meal ticket
eachterm regardless of whether or not they want
to eat in the expensive cafeteria. Food Services,
supported by university rules forbidding‘-the bring-
ing in of food tromithe outside, charge outrageous
prices for cookies, coffee andthe like to be served
at a school gathering. The new book store’ --
unlike the “service” function provided by the Car-
negie"l?‘ech book store -— ‘is going to be run like

.any other money-making- private_ business; the stu-
from the ‘non-stu-.

dent. will not be distinguished

Not So G.,e'nt|e Prodding

Similarly undesirable  the‘ practice by the
‘ Dean of Students’. Ofﬁce"o'f "sending unpleasant‘ re-
minders to students who are slow.‘ in making-_;a, de-_
fer‘:-ed’ tuition“ payment. And the «_ac_cumulat‘ed" an- -'

. nual tuition increases — both 7unhidden-and other- ’

wise-—have further contributed to this atmosphere. l_
A young man enters Pitt-and exempts first year_

.~ chemistry‘. A . girl similarly. wexempts first « year -
French.’ They‘ have _both"demonstrated.that‘they '
‘have at level of understanding in these ﬁelds ,co‘m"-..

have. had two four-credit courses in;,-those re_spec- -.
tive— ﬁelds.- Yet, they are not, given 2 eight §eredits.—-

, All» of _i:s_4must,' likewise, enroll in and pay .for.

\ 124 credit hours’. of, classes in order to graduate. 

We all ‘know the .cost of‘ credits.-_ ‘Accordingly, the

“going”. price" for a. bachel‘o_r’s_J.degree at Pitt--‘is

Letters to their  .1‘ 

 

$3856. A diploma represents the money we have ,
paid, more than the knowledge supposedly

_ acquired.

Burchasing Goes On ’ -

In much the same way. master’s degree diplo-
mas are selling for $936, and Ph.D. degrees cost
$2808 and up. The latter involves some highly
mercenary charges which we cannot consider here.

At all levels of study’ the accent is on money.
What we need is" a real advanced standing pro-
gram. Eight years ago the rules would have al-
lowed us to pay $5, take an advanced standing
examination, and get credits. Now the price is
$10.00 per credit for the same thing. And, to say
the least, ittis hardly encouraged.i _

In keeping with their drive to make our school
“second to none,” Pitt oﬁicials should adopt and
actively promote. an advanced standing program
where bona fide credits can be earned with no
price tags attached. ‘

The examination, both oral and written, should
require, a relatively high level of comprehension of

the material. The examinee who passes will there-  '

for have demonstrated a level of academic accom-

plishment superior to that of at least the ‘C’ stu- 4-,

dent (depending upon thethoroughness and dim-

= culty of the examination). -

Assets of Advanced Standing
Our school would havezmany strong assets in
a well publicizedadvanced standing program- An

academic prestige and attract good students.'—

Fraternity S

In reply to your V _
which appeared in the December

9_,l19,59,“,,edition of the Pitt News:
_ (The editorial- stated th'.atT

Wamong fraternities themselves
and between the fraternities’ and
the rest of the university.‘ More
important, however, the [frater-
nities must improve

feel that none of the above men-

with what I have to say.
That the proposed fraternity

row will be a majorboost to the.
fraternity system at Pitt is a ‘

«point, which, for the most part,
cannot be argued a negative
view- I can assure you, however,
that the rest of your editorial

showed an extreme lack of un-,

derstanding." ’

It is obvious that you have no‘;

true conception of the purposes
behind the fraternity system.
With your permission,
present them to you.
The first major purpose of so-
cial fraternities is, as the name
implies, to‘ provide social activi-.
-ties for their imembers. What

they do along this line should ,

be of no concern to the uni-
versity provided that they abide
by the university’s regulations
and that they refrain from hind-
ering its ‘operation.

The second major purpose be- ‘
hind the fraternity system is .to

should not-concern the non-fra-

. .Havin‘g. outlined the major
purposes behind. the fraternity
system, let me briefly comment
on your argument that the fra-
ternities should, in return for
new hou_ses,_obtain higher aca-
demic standing. ~'IThe acquisition
of a high .Q.P.A. is,,of course,
grounds for just praise..

Fraternities, however, do not
seek only intelligence.’.They seek
the w_hole man. They do not op-
erate on the principle that the
poorer student should be depriv-
ed, of social activities, fraternal
fellowship and a home away
from home.

It is not the qu_i2—kids of the
nation who form the backbone
of our society, though I will

son does - have. an’ "important

Matmen Go AfterNumber Two,-if

Cuzik to W/restle Heavyweight  

By TED COLTON

Seeking their second win of the young campaign, the

V Panther wrestling team. will go against as strong -Syracuse

team Saturday at the Field House. The meet is scheduled

to get under Way at 3 p.m,.

Syracuse received a major blow to their chances of ,up-
setting the Panthers when their star wrestler, Art Baker,

had to undergo a knee operation}

Baker, last year’s heavyweight

-f".Cl'lalI1plOI1 in the Easterns and 191

pound champ in the Nationals, is
the best collegiate heavyweight
_w1'estler in the country, but un-
"fortunately will
against the Panthers.-

Taking his place, owever, will
be another footballer. He _is center
Lee Miller and is supposed to be
pretty good, although he has not
"had much‘ experience. He will
tangle with Tom ‘Hall, who is one
and 0 this year.

Austin Leads Orange
outstanding performers
for the Orange are Les Austin and
Joe Pollack. Austin, who weighs
in at 137, placed in the Easterns
' last year and is a smart wrestler.

Pollack, 167 pounder, is also-
returning from last year’s team.
He defeated Alex Skirpan last

, year in the Eastern after Skir-
pan had broken his ribs.

There will probably be two
changes in the Panther line-up
—‘next Saturday. The one sure
gchance will come in the heavy-
»weight division, ’ -

not see actionv

Guzik Faces Miller‘ _
Bob Gu/zik, a guard on the foot-

ball team, will be matched against

Miller of Syracuse. This will be
Guzik’s first match this year after
ending up last yearwith a 0 and
two record. ‘Since both men are

football players, this should pro— ,

vide an interesting sideline.

Hall, who usually wrestles
heavyweight, will drop down to
191. This is a class that has been
put into the meets-in the East-
ern schools just this year. When
the Panthers are wrestling non-
Eastern" schools, they will not

, use this weight ﬂivision.

The other change may come
about in the 167 pound class. Paul
Wilson, who wrestled to a draw
against Maryland, may be re-
placed by Joe Schmitt.- The two
men will battle it out tonight at
the Field House to-see which one
will wrestleagainst the Orange.

' In the other divisions it will

be the Panther Mighty Mites,‘
Dick Martin and Larry. Lauchle,
in the 123 and 130 pound classes
respectively. ‘Daryl Kelvington

Swimming Team Meets Lehigh

With a very unirnpressive re-

l‘cord.of 0—3‘the Panther swim-

mers are well underway to their
poorest season in years. This Sat-
»-_;t_11'day Coach Ben Grady’s squad
meets the mermen of Lehigh at
the Carnegie Tech pool.
 Without any previous informa-
tion on Lehigh’s strength,’ Coach‘
Grady is still optimistic that his
boys can pull out their first vic-
tory of the season." » \.
When asked his opinion of free-
style star, Jim Eckert, Grady said,
. ‘_‘Jim is a ﬁne .boy and I look for
-*‘him to do better.” This past

HAIL TO THE DEAN!

Today let us examine that’ much maligned, widely misunder-
stood, grossly overworked, wholly dedicated campus figure-—
the dean: « , '

'The dean (from the Latin dc(mcre—to expel) is not, asma._ny
think, primarily a disciplinary officer. He is a counselor and
guide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean

(from the Greek dea«ngs—to skewer) is characterized chieﬂy by '
sympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for‘

homely pleasures like‘ barn—raisings, gruel, spelldowns, and
Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German decmge-macht
—-to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same reasoirtliat

all men of good will are fond of Ma1'lboros—because Marlboro’

is an honest cigarette. Those be_ttcr makin’s are honestly better,
honestly aged to the peak of perfection, honestly blended for
the best of all possible ﬂavors. The ﬁlter honestly ﬁlters.
l\I:i1'lboro' honestly comes in two different conta.iners——a ‘soft

packwhich is honestly soft, and a flip-topubox which honestly *

ﬂips. You too will ﬂip wlieniicxt, you try an honest Marlboro,
which’, one honestly hopes, will be soon. '

But Idigress. We were learning how a dean helps under-
graduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical case from the ﬁles
of Dean S. . . . . . . . of the University of Y . . . . . . . .. (Oh, why

_ be so mysterious? The dc:m’s name is Sigafoos and the Univer- b
sity is Yutah.)

‘K

ab?"

* ifé‘ We/I/97;? 526/752////,7./1/gg/’,_

_ ‘ Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos wasyisited one daykby a fresh-

man named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to
marry one Emma. Blenheim, his dormitory Iaundress. To the
dean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18
and Emma was 91. Walter agreed, but said he felt obligated to
go‘ through with it because Emma had invested her life savings
in a transparent rain hood to protect her from the mist at
Niagara Falls where they planned to spend their honeymoon.
What use, asked Walter, would the poor woman have for a rain
hood in Yutah? The wise, kindly dean pondered brieﬂy and
came up with an answer:‘ let‘ Walter punch holes in the back of
Emma’s steam iron; with steam billowing back at the old lady,
she would ﬁnd a rain hood very useful—possibly even essential.

Whimpering ’with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean’s Phi
Beta Kappa key and ‘hastened away to follow his advice which,
it pleasures me to report, solved matters brilliantly.

Today Emma is a happy woman—singing lustily, wearing her
rain hood, eating soft—center chocolates, and ironing clothcs—-
twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter.
.  And Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his liaison with
Emma, he married a girl much nearer his own 21ge—Agncs
Yucca, 72. Walteris now the proud fatlier-—sitcpfather, to be
perfectly accurate-—of three ﬁne healthy boys from Ag‘nes’s ﬁrst
marriage—Everett, 38; Willem, 43; and Irving, 55-and when
Walter puts the boys in Eton collars and takes them for a stroll
in the park on Sunday afternoons, you may be sure thereis not
a dry eye in Yutah. . . . And Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy-
happy to spend long, tiring days in his little oﬂice, giving counsel
without stint and Without complaint, doing his bit to set the
young, uncertain feet of his charges on the path to a brighter
tomorrow, © woo Max Shulman

It # *

We don't say that Marlboro is the dean of ﬁlter cigarettes,
but it’s sure at the head of the class. Try some—or if you
prefer mildness without filters, try popular Philip‘ Morris
from the same makers. ' ‘ -
