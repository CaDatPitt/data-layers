Pam‘hersMauI Irish, 3 1- 10

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

SOUTH BEND,Ind.——Once was
truly not enough as the Pitt
Panthers, who last year “upset“
Notre Dame, proved their first
victory in 12 years over the
Fighting Irish was no ﬂuke by
repeating with a 31-10 win
Saturday before 59,075 fans at
Notre Dame Stadium.

Saying the win was a big one
would be an understatement
because the talk began circulating
and the pressure building after the
Panthers surprised the Irish, 34-20,
last Nov. 15 at Pitt Stadium. The
Irish were out for revenge,
understandably, and on a guy
named Tony Dorsett especially.

Dorsett, as everyone by now
knows, has done more running
against Notre Dame than the coeds
at nearby St. Mary’s College.
Going into Saturday's nationally
televised rematch, the “Hawk“
had rushed for 573 yards in three

Food Co-op
 Business This Fall

BY MARILYN WEISS

The Pitt food co-op, which
survived a successful spring trial
run, will resume operation at the
end of September, according to
co-op committee chairman Freida
Lalli.

The co-op committee, an arm of
Student Government purchases

houses in the city's strip district

last year.

This year, however, Notre Dame
head coach Dan Devine said his
team was going. to stop Dorsett,
perhaps keep him from reaching
300 for the second year in a row.
And they did just that, holding
Dorsett to a “mere“ 181 yards.

“I had a goal to get at least 200
yards, “Dorsett said after the
game, when he was swamped by
the most reporters to cover a Pitt
game in many years “But I knew
Notre Dame was out to get me. I
didn't accomplish what Iwanted to,

. but I'm happy people will
remember me for what I did
accomplish.“

It seemed the “Hopewell Ex-
press“ was going to reach his goal
when he scampered for 61 yards in
his very ﬁrst attempt, Pitt's initial

play from scrimmage, after Notre Q 3

Dame put a quick touchdown on the
scoreboard.

“That sort of took the sting out of
them,“ Dorsett said. “I think we

According to Lalli, the 15%
markup is a big savings over the 50
to 100% markup tagged to food by
retail dealers.

“When we were buying lettuce
for approximately 20 cents a head,
stores were charging 49 cents,”
Lalli said. “That’s amarkup of
over 50%.

“We were selling ‘onions for 10
to 12 cents a pound, while the
stores were offering three pounds
for 89 cents. You can't say that
isn't a 100% markup," Lalli said.

Rick Slager sighted a wide open

the ball to him, and the
All-America end eased into the end

Voters are Disenchanted

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

The American people are disen-
chanted with both presidential
candidates Jimmy Carter and
President Ford, according to Lesley
Dork, youth coordinator for the
Socialist Worker Party presidential
campaign.

“Only 17.6% of those eligible
voted in the primaries, and of
those, Carter received 4.2% and
Ford 3.4% of the vote,” Dork said
at a meeting of the Pitt Young
Socialist Alliance last Friday.

“The American people have cast
a vote of no confidence," Dork
said. “In 1976, the real choice is
between either Carter or Ford and
the Socialist ticket of Peter Camejo
and Willie Mae Reid.”

Dork sharply attacked Carter as a
segregationist. “When appointed

'9 to the all white Sumpter County

school board in 1956, he proposed a
change in the site of an all black
high school so that black and white
children would not have to walk
down the same street.”

We must judge the Republican
party by how it responds to the
crisis of Watergate, according to
Dork.

Citing the recent Church com-
mittee report on the alleged
improprieties of the F.B.I. as
evidence of continued “police
spying" in the current administra-
tion, Dork said, “those supposed to
enforce the laws are in fact the top
law breakers.

“There is a stark contrast
‘between the Democratic and
Republican candidates as opposed
to the Socialists," Dork said.

Facility Planning Director Hunt
Martin.

Since winter term ended, the
Forbes Avenue bridge connecting
the Towers with the new Law
Building and the Professional
Quadrangle has been completed.

The bridge’s completion in May
came after a delay caused by
problems in transferring the
Towers’ electrical transformers.

Both the bridge and Law School
were paid for with state funds
through the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of General Services.

Martin said the bridge can be of
great value “only if people are
willing to use it.” Part of its
purpose is to channel pedestrian
traffic to help alleviate congestion
on Forbes Avenue, Hunt said.

The $8.5 million Law School
Building was officially dedicated on
May 1.

With Forbes area development
expected to be complete by spring
of 1977, Martin said, “Constructi-
on of the Forbes Plaza and
Professional Quadrangle are pro-
ceeding smoothly as scheduled.”

The plaza between Hillmany
Library and David Lawrence Hall
will lead trom Forbes Avenue to the
new Professional Quadrangle and
include stairways to the two older
structures.

Plaza construction began in May

requiring only six to eight weeks of I

work but is still under way because

country, was designed to fight low
enrollment in _Pitt’s program,
according to Major Thomas
Adams, military science professor.
Under the new plan, a cadet can
complete the four-year ROTC
program by taking only four
non-credit academic courses, one
at the end of the sophomore year
and the other three during the
junior and senior years.
Previously, an ROTC cadet was
tequired to‘ take one academic
course from the military science
department each term he or she
was enrolled at the University.
Eighty cadets are currently
enrolled in Army ROTC, a low

ﬁgure that the department attri-Q

butes to the fact that academic
credit is not given for ROTC
courses by the College of Arts and
Sciences. Pitts’ is one of only three
ROTC departments in the country
that do not receive credits.

The new curriculum still requires
cadets to attend one training

session a‘ week. Traditionally, this  

block of instruction was where the
ROTC cadets learned how to
march. That too has been changed.

“We’re trying to deemphasize
the marching and drilling that’s
become associated with the ROTC

the old steam lines under Forbes
Avenue and Sennott Street are
being replaced'with larger, more
reliable ones, to provide heat for
lower campus buildings. or

The Professional Quadrangle will
include the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs,
currently housed-in Bruce Hall, the
Graduate School of Education
located on the 27th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral and the Department of
Social Sciences. ’ \

With the completion of the
Quadrangle, Bruce Hall will be
converted into a dormitory.

Martin said the new School of
Nursing across from the Lothrop
Street Residence should be ﬁnish-
ed in about a month.

The physical plant division also
completed the dorm safety project,
already tested by a false fire alarm
in Amos Hall last Friday morning,
in time for fall occupancy of the
dorms.

A communication system, warn-
inghsystem, sprinklers and escape
bridges, accessible only during
emergencies from the dorm’s 10th
ﬂoors, have been completed and
are operational. .

The department also facilitated
curb cuts and special door
installations. around the lower
campus. including I-Iillman Libra-
ry, Crawford .Hal’lp.. and the
Cathedral, to aid the handicapped.

Green Attacks Heinz

_At Campaign Opening

3.

BY MREA CSORBA

Pittsburgh needs a Democratic
senator, not a Western Pennsyl-
vania Republican, to ﬁll Hugh
Scott’s U.S. Senate. That’s what
Senate hopeful William J. Green
(D-Philadelphia) told a Pittsburgh
audience as he opened his
Downtown campaign headquarters
here Friday.

Green rejected the contension of
his opponent, H. John Heinz III
(R-Fox Chapel), that Pittsburghers
would be served best by a
candidate from this area.

Green criticized Heinz’ vote to
limit Social Security beneﬁt in-
creases to ﬁve per cent, maintained
that Heinz was the only Southwes-
tern Pennsylvania congressman to
oppose federal transit subsidies
and said it was him, not Heinz, who
initiated legislation to repair

Allegheny County's structurally /

deﬁcient bridges.

“It took Bill Green to get Heinz
off his ‘tuch’ to repair the
Smithﬁeld Street Bridge,” Green
said. “We need a change from
post-Watergate scandals. We need
a Democrat.” .

Speaking heatedly to a crowd’
gathered before his Ninth and
Smithﬁeld Street headquarters,
Green said Heinz did not show for
the Thursday night debate sched-
uled at the Press Club. Downtown,

g between the two candidates be-

cause Heinz did not want to answer

BILL GREEN

Green's charges.

The candidates did face each
other Saturday in a debate before
the editors of United Press
International in King of Prussia,
‘Pa., and they are planning future
debates.

‘Heinz press secretary Ed Phillips
denied the Thursday debate date
had been made ﬁnal.

“We agreed to debate, but
notiﬁed the Press Club a week in
advance that Heinz could not make
the date due to other commit-
ments," Phillips said.

program,” Adams said. Cadets
will now receive instruction on the
history of the Army, military
customs, first aid and rappelling
techniques.

“You see," Adams said, “the
Army has a need for well-rounded
civilians. If we're going to stay in
touch with the rest of society, we
have to have a continual input from
the civilian sector into our ofﬁcer
corps. V

“Besides, the commissioned
ofﬁcers we send to the active Army
have talents that the Army needs
and would have trouble getting
from other sources—like doctors,
lawyers and engineers.”

Adams said he hopes the new
curriculum will quiet criticism that
has charged the ROTC department

curriculum set up by the Pentagon.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

ODI Misguided

It ’,s easy to sympathize with the Oakland Development Inc. efforts to
keep intact and improve on what's left of the Oakland community.
lhere are enemies everywhere. On one side, slum conditions become
more prevalent in Oakland, and, to the South, lies the smog and soot of
steel mills and highways.

Worst of all, right in the middle of the Oakland community, the
University of Pittsburgh slowly eats its way out, devouring street after
street. Finally, the part of Oakland left untouched by the invading
cultures lies dormant, ready to crumble into oblivion.

The constant strain of battle, unfortunately, has manifested itself in
a paranoid reaction by ODI to the attempt of a local businessman to
remodel a fomier bar into a supper club.

Ernest Smallis, owner of the Chances R supper club, formerly known

I as Wohlfarth's Pub, is under attack primarily because of the reputation

of the pub.

It only seems logical that it would be preferable to have a supper club
in operation rather than a bar that was the scene of many brawls. But
ODI only remembers Wohlfarth's reputation and assumes that
Chances R will be the same.

ODI ‘also is fearful that the new night club will turn into a
discotheque, despite the owner's statements to the contrary. They see
the Chances R as part of a “growing problem of congestion in
Oakland's central business district." Again, it seems that a supper
clubwould be better for the business district than a bar and almost
certainly better than a vacant building.

ODI should realize the bars and the fast food restaurants are the only
part of Oakland left that is alive and productive. If done right, Oakland

can become the major center of recreation in Pittsburgh.

So we encourage ODI to keep a protective eye on Oakland. They
have every right to object when a seedy operation opens up.

But the Chances R restaurant does not become seedy by virtue of its
predecessor's reputation, and until actual events, instead of wild
imaginings, prove differently, we feel ODl's attempts to close down the

Chances R are misguided.

About twenty miles south of Butler

and some men of the big rigs hung
bleary-eyed over faded formica and
weak coffee as the green and white
Quaker State, swayed with the

Atrocious

Bill Moore deserves a commen-
dation for his editorial “Apart-
ments Stink.” He has spoken to
one of the most serious problems
facing Pitt and Oakland and has
proposed workable solutions. We
are particularly impressed with the
idea of a “secret list of realtors”
and would like to make a few
suggestions.

The Oakwood-Franklin Tenant
Association, from buildings owned
by Pitt, would like to suggest that a
student organization use Pitt's
performance as a landlord as the
yardstick by which to measure

other landlords and realtors, r

considering the vast experience
they have had running the large
number of apartment buildings and
houses they own in Oakland.

Pitt, in keeping with its policies
of being a “good neighbor” and a
“good landlord" has: ~

1. Failed to provide regular basic
maintenance.

2. Failed to respond quickly to
emergency situations.

3. Reneged on agreements worked
out betweer. the Pitt administration
and the tenant association.

4. Raised rents annually without
explaining the reasons for the
increase.

5. Proceeded with ridiculous
external beautiﬁcation while ignor-
ing interior conditions.

6. “Renovated" one small building
(18 apartments) while ignoring
more than 80 other units in various
buildings . _
(Continued on Pace 6)

with the ND inscription they were
supposed to pick up.

There was also an insurance
salesman in southern Illinois who
had to drop off a brief of papers for
one of the secretaries to ﬁle. It was
"half an hour before opening at the
small O'Leary Insurance and Real
Estate Ofﬁce. His‘family waited in
the car, the kids were asleep, and
he was taking the day, indeed the
entire weekend, off.

Later that day the buses, cars
and convoys from work descended
on the Notre Dame campus in
droves. They were part of one of
the longest-standing and least-
analyzed cults in America, that
century-old tradition that is proba-
bly more Catholic than Irish, more
rooted in the spirit of winning than
in the conﬁnes of religion.

IMPRESSIONS

Television can't even begin to
touch on it. With all its spattering
of Schick safety blade and General
Motors commercials and the
fast-paced, often too encapsulated
football commentaries, there is no
way any network can reproduce the
rich aroma of dry leaves kicked in
campus corners that accounts for
only one-millionth of the excite-

There is no limit to the number of
times a network can replay the,
Notre Dame Fight Song (perhaps
the most famous in the country), or
even cover it by camera live, and
still fail to show the reason why
thousands and thousands return
each year, and re-snap photos and
slides of the Golden .Dome and the
bust of Knute Rockne.

It is here where television loses
its God-almighty power and is seen '
only for the cheap mirror that it is.
Beyond its ability to reﬂect, it has
no ﬁne tuning knob to enable it to
peer. no antenna to aim at this
campus that could tell us why they
come so faithfully.

Maybe it's just that television is
overwhelmed by the years, which
lies at the heart of Notre Dame.
The perserverance to be a constant
winner, a seeker of academic
excellence and a pursuer of, well,
what has since become a cheap
word, glory.

A lot of it is sheer nostalgia, too,
like men who recount the big
games and the big plays, Sorin the
Founder, the Four Horsemen, the
Gipper, the Fire, Ara's Era, all
while playing with the electronic
flushers in the johns along the Ohio
Turnpike. And yet those who
speak most often of these events
were scarcely out of the crib, let
alone old enough to read about
them, when they took place. It's as
if the heroes stand taller and the
legends grow richer with each
telling day.- And they even have a
ritual at which they conjure up the
old ghosts, whether you imagine
Rockne the way he was or as the
slimmer Pat O'Brien who played
him in Knute Rockne, All Ameri-
can.

Soft girls rub up against you, and

you're struck with the notion that"

ten years ago at one of these?
things, it might not have smelled as
nice. Some guys like to gripe about
Notre Dame's turning co-ed a few
years ago, but the cult hasn't
turned back, not by a carload. Sex
has in no way blunted the
enthusiasm, but rather sharpened
it as only full grown women in
T-shirts could.

If you can see over the perspiring
pyramid builders and reeling piggy
backs, you'll notice the players andis

tossing back the streaming toilet
rolls. The acoustics are over-
whelming as drum rolls and mob
roars shoot up and down the dome;
some feel faint and escape outside,
others must lean against the
concrete wall despite the hot sweat
that rolls down the bricks into one's
hair and skin.

It's clear that in the last decade V 1'

while bricks and bottles flew on
other campuses, sis-boom-bah
came here to roost. It found goo
refuge, we can assume, as footballs
and tissue rolls now ﬂy freely
elsewhere. This is not a hall for
crusading. at least at this moment.
One would think that these
students-soon-to-be-job-seekers
are unaware of the 7.9% unem-
ployment rate. But as the Fighting

thousands of ﬁngers raised to
Number One, one begins to get the
feeling that no matter what the
outcome of the game, this crowd
knows with all its Catholic, co-ed?”
shamrock-shaped heart, who num-
bcr one is. And that's a feeling no
doubt that stays long after the

A Losing Battle

BY BOB PELLIGRINI

It’s kind of hard to be neighborly
when the neighbor on your right is
a new university building and the
neighbor on your left is a parking
lot. The parking lot almost never
responds to your Christmas cards
and the University, when it
responds, usually sends a_ letter
trying to buy you out.

So, in a sense, it is a ﬁtting
windmill for the ODI to joust.

But in defending; Oakland

against the ravages of business,
the ODI is crying rape to the
violation of a prostitute who has
long forgotten her virginity.

Oakland has always been crowd-

ed. It's hard to remember any
more, but Forbes Field used to
produce more noise and congestion

Wohlfarth‘s might just attract more
people to come to Oakland, as the
ODI seems to believe. If it does,
then that means there is just more
people shopping in the Oakland
community, spending more money.
If that means more congestion, it
also means better business.
Finally, it is hard to understand
why the ODI wants to shut down

Pitt YMCA’;
Volunteers

BY MAGGIE McKAY

A 14-year old kid steals a car one
day and joy rides around the city.
He's caught and slapped away in
an institution, a juvenile delinquent
to be heard from until he’s out on
parole and commits another crime.

Few people want to deal with
juvenile delinquents. They see
them as hardened criminals to be
suppressed rather than helped.

One group that is devoted to
helping the juvenile delinquent is
Juvenile Volunteers in Action
(JVA), a three-year-old project of
the Pitt YMCA.

A student-coordinated program,
JVA operates under the Juvenile
Court of Allegheny County and
works mainly with youths assigned
to the Oakland Juvenile Probation
Office.

Approximately 30 Pitt students
are “big brothers” or “big sisters”
to youths on probation. Since the

juvenﬂe,
In Action

program's inception in 1973,
volunteers have worked with more
than 40 youths on a one-to-one
basis. Only five per cent of these
youngsters have committed any
additional offense while in the
program, compared to 50 per cent
among delinquents on probation
generally, according to Pitt YMCA
Director Tom Huff.

JVA recently was awarded a
$5,000 Governor‘s Justice Com-
mission grant from the Federal Law
Enforcement Assistance Agency.
The award was given in recognition

"of the program’s success in

reducing the recidivism of the
probationers in the program,
according to Henry Scott, JVA’s
student coordinator. This money
will be used to cover volunteers
expenses incurred while working
with the youngsters and will make
more group outings possible.
Volunteers must participate in
training and feedback sessions
weekly, as well as spend time with

Prof. Likes New

BY BILL MOORE

When Jose Moreno left Sagua La
Grande, Cuba, 26 years ago, the
island was "characterized by the
wealth of its capitol city and the
stark poverty of its countryside.

But now, according to Pitt
Associate Sociology Professor Jose
Moreno, “the city has movedto the
countryside. ”

Moreno, recently returned from
a one month visit to Cuba where he
visited with family and did informal
research, said the change in Cuba
since Castro came to power is not
immediately evident.

“It is only when you keep talking
to people,” Moreno said in his
office Friday, “and when you look
more carefully, that you begin to
see the differences.

“You don’t see beggars any-
more, and you don’t see little boys
selling cigarettes and toqtjhbrush-_
es.”

The subtle change in Cuba, the
more equitable distribution of
wealth and resources, is the
beginning of an “infrastructure,”
Moreno said. “I talked with no one
-who wasn’t working while I was

the basic necessities of life.” K
When Moreno left Cuba at the j
age of 21, illiteracy was‘ prevalent *
in the impoverished countrysides.
Today, he was told, more than 95% *
of school age children are receiving
an education. “The battle for this‘
year, I was told, was that everyone
finish sixth grade. This is where 1*
see the changes of the revolution." «k

many of whom attend special
boarding schools where they attend
class by day and work the ﬁelds in
the afternoon and early evening.

Moreno said education is prob-
ably the most important achieve-
ment of the Castro regime, but
other basic human services also are
more available.

About half of Cuba’s 6,000
doctors left during the revolution,
and the already critical health care
shortage worsened. Today, accord-
ing to Moreno, there are more than
7,000 doctors and basic health care
is available throughout the country.

Everyone in Cuba is being.-.
encouraged to work, including
women. Day care centers are

provided, Morena said, for women
with children.

“You don’t see the poverty you
used to see,” Moreno said, “But
you don’t see-wealth. Everyone

People are being educated and they

Moreno said he was pleased with n

to Huff, have no official status in
the courts although they are
associated with the probation
office. Their work is kept as
separate from the probation office
as possible.

.pro-social

“The kids are suspicious and
sometimes it takes weeks before
they are on speaking terms. The
persistence of volunteers is criti-
cal.”

A volunteer, according to Scott,
has to have an open mind and must
be able to relax and be himself.

“We turn down the missionary
types, the ones who are full of the
‘I'm going to baptize the natives’
attitude,” Scott said. “As a
volunteer you have to just be as you
are. We just try to give the kids
some sort of outlook on life. We try
to give them a chance to see and do
different things.”

Or as Huff put it, the volunteer
serves as a role model for the
delinquent.

“One thing about a delinquent is
that the dominant role models in
his life are untrustworthy or
engage in anti-social behavior,”
I-I.uff said. “But in the volunteer,
he sees someone engaging in
behavior, someone
who’s going to school, working-
someone who's got it all together.

It's a subtle thing. He can begin to
realize that there are people who
live without constantly challenging
authority." ‘

In addition to weekly meetings
between the volunteer and the
youth the program arranges
monthly trips to state parks and
other recreational facilities. The
purpose of the trips is to see how
the volunteers and kids interact in a
group situation. New volunteers
are invited to attend these outings
and are judged by the way they
interact with the group also.

“If new volunteers are shy and
stick to themselves, we generally
feel they would not be suited for
the program and often try to steer
them into" another more suitable
YMCA program,’-’ Huff said.

The JVA program is being
expanded to include 20 volunteers
this fall and 30 in the winter.

One of JVA’s aims is to educate‘
its volunteers and the public about
the juvenile delinquency problem.

“It’s hard to top _

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Declaring state residency is,
for many students. one way of
beating the high out-of-state tuition
rate. The controversy surrounding
residency requirements and tuition
eligibility produces dozens of
lawsuits each year.

Pitt has had its share of days in
court. haggling over residency
problems.

In 1972. a state-wide ‘residency
rule sparked a class action suit on
behalf of married women students

1973. she applied for a course at
Pitt and was classified as a
non-resident. Farley enrolled in
September, 1973. but dropped out
in December because of the tuition
rate. She registered again in June.
1974. but has not yet been
classified as either an in- or out-of-
state resident.

Dena Meyers came to Pitt in
1963 and attended the University
as an undergraduate and graduate
student until April, 1970. She
worked for the Pittsburgh board of

} |n-Stute ResidencyTuitionSu

education and for the Braddock
school system and Eye and Ear
hospital from April. 1970, until
June. 1971. In June, Meyers re-
entered the University. She paid
tuition as a non-resident for the
summer and fall terms. but not for
the winter term.

Cynthia Samuel attended college
in New York and taught school in
New Jersey. She left New Jersey in
April, 1970, for Pittsburgh where
her husband was to attend medical
school. In June, 1971 she enrolled

at Pitt. From April. 1970, to June.
1972. she held a series of jobs in
Pittsburgh. She also had to pay
out-of-state tuition fees.

S The District Court examined the
four women's cases and found that
rule B(2) did not apply to their
cases and they could receive no
damages.

This decision was appealed to
the Third Circuit Court of Philadel-
phia in June. 1976. The Circuit
Court reversed the District Court's
ruling in part. saying that B(2) was

unconstitutional, but that the
women were entitled to restitution.

The Circuit Court also ordered that
the case be remanded to the
District Court for further considera-
tion with the directions that it enter
a judgement consistent with the
Circuit Court's opinion.

For Pitt. and the other state
related universities, Penn State
and Temple, an appeal to the
Supreme Court remains a possibili-

Previn Dazzles At g Opening

BY PAMELA EUSI

Friday night was one of the most
exciting nights in Pittsburgh's
history. Andre Previn conducted
the Pittsburgh Symphony in a
dazzler of 5 concert that will be
remembered for years to come.

Previn played the role of the
devil himself demanding the souls
of the musicians in exchange for
music vivid with action and
dynamic inrange. He masterfully
guided the orchestra through
Berlioz’ Overture to the Corsair,
Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 6
and Brahms’ Symphony No. 1 in C
minor.

Previn was on top of the music
every second, shaping it, molding
it with crisp cues, literally dancing
on the podium with the flow of the
music and then turning around to
each ._section in turn, urging
strength and instilling spirit in the
musicians.

Berlioz sketched his famous
Overture while on a trip to Italy and
after 11 years of work and various
titles the final Overture was
completed to his satisfaction.

The piece opens with spectacular
violin runs interrupted by sporadic
woodwind intervals. The music
then begins a melodic course with
several moments of brass challen-
ges to the steady cello lines. Later
in the work sharp attacks from the

Ray   Thomas’
‘Hopes’
Album

Drips Mush

BY TOM WASELESKI

Hopes, Wishes & Dreams, Ray
Thomas. Threshold Records, THS
17.

In contrast to his previous solo
effort, ex-Moody Blue Ray Thomas
has come through with a record
that fans of his earlier group can
delight in.

From Mighty Oaks was only so
much gravy, but Hopes, Wishes 8:
Dreams is more the album of
substance one would expect from a
member of perhaps the most
sophisticated band of the last ten
years.

Thomas still hangs on to the
romantic trappings of the Moody
Blues days: cover illustrations that
rank high with Soft Touch greeting
cards for their schlockiness, and
lyrics that would ﬁt inside those
cards. But for all its sentimen-
tality, the album is musically
superb and gushing with complex-
ity.

“Friends” is an easy, sweeping
ballroom tune in % time similar to
“For My Lady,” which Thomas
wrote and sang for the Blues’ last
LP, Seventh Sojoum. His vocal is
strong yet soft and the backup
orchestration is reserved, not
overly evident as it was on the
Might Oaks LP. Credit Terry

violins contrast with solo bassoon
sections. The Overture comes to a
blazing ﬁnish with sparkling brass
and colorful orchestration.

Shostakovich was working on his
Symphony No. 6, Opus 53 when
Hitler was readying his troops to
march into Poland in the summer of
1939 and the world was on the
brink of war. Shosstakovich
embodies much of the spirit of the
Russian people in his. works,
attempting to show the sufferings
of war and the heroics of his
people.

The lower strings open the
symphony with solemnity leading

Low string tremolos along with
diverse instrumental contrasts
keep the tone of the movement low
key.

The next movement is alive with
rhythmic impulses that keep
jumping from sections to individual
instruments so it appears that the
orchestra is one big circus with
everyone enjoying the fun. The

Pgh. Ballet Theatre:
Impressive Heights
ODI Misguided

BY LEAH McFARLAND

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre is
pretty impressed with itself this
fall. Chances are, audiences will
be too.

In addition to repeat perfor-
mances by the outstanding dancers
and choreographers visible in the
last season, a number of new
talents will be introduced to
Pittsburgh audiences. The two
world premieres and one Pitts-
burgh premiere on display at Heinz
Hall this Friday, Saturday and
Sunday should give an excellent
view of both.

First of the world premieres is

Maria Sabina, choreographed by
Nicholas Petrov, artistic director of
the Ballet Theatre. A true life
story, this ballet deals with the
story of a village high-priestess in
South America who holds the
secret of a type of mushroom which
heals the sick. However, the
“magic mushrooms” are also
highly hallucinogenic, and the
high-priestess eventually sells the
tribal secret to a group of people
who misuse the mushrooms, dying
of overdoses. Justice, in the form
of other tribe members, steps in
and the high-priestess is tried and
executed.

The part of Maria Sabina will be
danced by Kaleria Fedicheva,
former prima ballerina of the

N. Y. Toots Revival Craze

BY LEN ROMBERG

People who are anxiously
waiting for new musicals to make
their way West can always get a
preview by taking a look at what is
happening around New York.
Unfortunately, a look down the
Great White Way will not raise any
eyebrows.

Box office receipts in New York
are about as good as ever. -This is
due to past season successes and
one other current craze. A
shortage of new musicals is
creating a drought along Broadway
and producers have escaped the

trauma of empty theatres by
turning to the revival.
After the bountiful 1974-75

season, which brought A Chorus
Line, Chicago, Shenandoah, and
The Wiz to New York, the musical
theatre has fallen into a slump,
creating disaster after disaster.
Unknown failures like Home
Sweet Homer, Rex, and 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue bombed in-
stnntly.

Even the Drama Critics‘ choice
for best musical, Pacific Overtures,
the Harold Prince-Stephen Sond-
heim adventure, closed this sum-
mer after a disappointing six-
month run.

While some bold producers
experiment with their ultimate
disasters and shake off the losses.
other producers have discovered

This past season kicked off the
revival craze with a return of Hello
Dolly starring Pearl Baily. The
limited engagement with Baily
proved successful, extending the
engagement an extra few weeks,
while delaying the start of Pearls
United Nations career.

With hopes of a more permanent
stay. came the 20th anniversary
production of My Fair Lady. It
came without Julie Andrews or Rex
Harrison. but with just‘ ‘as much‘

fanfare. Critics and theatre-goers
instantly began to compare the new
leads to their original counterparts.

“How did the world get along
without My Fair Lady for 15,000
years?" suggest one newspaper
ad. There is little doubt that My
Fair Lady is one of the finest
musical theatre achievements.
which perhaps justifies the revival.
Maybe the capacity crowds paying
a $17 top price per ticket also
justifies it.

While .My Fair Lady started its
predicted long run, the next revival
rolled out the red carpet for its
arrival. Guys And Dolls bounced
into The Broadway Theatre on July
17. Style is the key to the Blackcast
version of Guys And Dolls which
came completely renewed with an
updated script and conga drums.
Its jazzy music and fun story is
making the show instantly popular
again.

Guys And Dolls’ new stars,
whose performances are commen-
dable. are also being matched
against those who first played the
parts. This further supports the
idea that Broadway nostalgia
serves as a replacement until the
next newly created musicals finally
come to town.

The revivals are pleasing aud-
iences. Familiar names can be
seen and good ole’ show tunes
hummed as they leave the theatres.

Russian Kirov Ballet and currently

Thierry Dorado and Alexander
Filipov, familiar to Pittsburgh
audiences from past seasons, will
dance the constable and the town
crier, respectively.

This ballet has appeared pre-
viously at Carnegie Hall in concert
form. The graphic format and
concept of this story were so
intense that audiences rioted after
the first performance. Given the
added impact of dance, Maria
Sabina could well be the ballet
which forever silences the stereo-
type of this art form as Friday-night
entertainment for wealthy widows.

An added plus for Pitt students
will be the chance to enjoy the sets,

created by Henry Heymann,
associate professor in Pitt’s theatre
department.

Not content with producing one
thriller, the Ballet Theatre has
scheduled another world premier,
Othello, as the second event on the
program. The story is well-known
to anyone with even one Shakes-
peare course behind him or her.
Not dull, by any means, and this

performance holds the added ‘

benefit of costumes done by Ruben
Yerartunina, the foremost creator
of ballet costumes in the world.

Othello, a modern ballet, has
been choreographed by the world-
famous John Butler. His rather
peculiar style of A choreography,
which includes a large number of
lifts, has been called “air-born"
and “unstoppable.”

And dancing under that direction
will be Alexander Filipov as Othello
the Moor, JoAnn McCarthy as
Desdemona and Thierry Dorado as
the villain Iago.

In addition, the Ballet Theatre is
presenting a new ballerina, Nancy
Dickson, as Emilia.

To change the mood, the third
ballet on the weekend's program is

“Dancers, Romancers_, Dreamers
& Schemers,” Michael Quatro.
United Artists, UA-LA 587-G.

For a second album, it ain't bad.

But Michael Quatro's first
record, the less than smashing In
Collaboration with the Gods, is far
better, hence the disappointment
in this one.

Outshining the more notorious
keyboard soloist Rick Wakeman,
Quatro showed himself to be
seriously interested in the venture-
some ﬁeld of rock-classics fusion.
Though some parts ran together

rather than flowed in the- last
album. there was still no mistaking
his expertise as an interesting new
musician.

The reﬁnements that were hoped
for in the next album never took
place, Quatro unleashing more
guitar this time. and with it, more
sour spots.

“Stripper" is hard rock at its
least creative. A repetitive electric
melody, a tinny vocal that Alice
Cooper couId’ve sat in on, and
regarding Quatro, no keyboards
worth speaking of.

“Circus," co-written with sister
Susie. is about as successful, this
time with grinding, vibrating
throwback to the-guitars of the
mid-60s. But Quatro really sells his
musical soul on “Ancient Ones," a
seven-and-a-half-minute audio
wasteland that features trite lines
narrated by David Surkamp and

Condor. _A cold, impersonal spy
yarn that suffers‘ from cold,

tempts to be heavy and Kafkaesque

enough if you don't want to take it

' too seriously.

November 20: Woodstock. A
fuzzily focused account of the 1969
rock festival that seems now like a
bad memory. The tediousness of
the film and the musical perform-
ers it shows must be an attempt to
make the viewer suffer just like the
people at the original festival did.
Show times are at 7 and 10:30 p.m.
Admission is 50 cents in advance
and 75 cents at the door.

December 4: Shampoo. This

overrated cult film got some hot

press at the time of its release, but
soon subsided into a glossy story of
an over-sexed Hollywood beauti-
cian around election time, 1968.
There's an allegory in there
somewhere, but it's buried under
the suds.

December I 1: Return of the Pink
Panther. He was better off where
he was. This sequel to The Pink

title sequence is great, though.

Quatro's adolescent shifting of the
speeds on the tape that tracks the
lead quitar.

The artist doesn't enter with any
strong keyboard until well into the
second side on “Pure Chopin,"
original stuff by the Polish
composer, perverted by Quatro's
stifling arrangement of hot guitars.

“One by One" is perhaps the
only truly polished piece. Its only
fault is its over-romanticization
(I'm telling ya, it's one extreme to
another). The band and Quatro's
keyboard is well integrated for
once, the ballad itself is pretty, and
its release as a single would surely
be a smash a la Barry Manilow, in
which, of course, lies a certain
amount of shame for a musician
with Quatro's caliber.

He does a handy job with the
lengthy “Adagio" and “Touch of
Class," the latter supposedly
composed on the spot. and
recorded live with no overdubs.
Also cute is “Rollerbach," a
rockin' organ and guitar version of
the theme from Rollerball.

Rather than perform off-the-cuff
heroics and shed new light on
movie themes, Quatro would do
much better perfecting the fresh
and lively keyboard fusions he
embarked on an album ago.

Opening Gala

(Continued from Page 10)
strings announce the main subject
which is echoed by the woodwinds.
The strings play with the theme
until the entire orchestra joins in to
make this dance movement full of
celebration and very festive.

Brahms’ Symphony No. 1 in C
minor, Opus 68 celebrated its 100th
anniversary Friday night. Brahms
came so very close to matching the
style of Beethoven in this first
symphony that contemporaries
were prompted to call it The Tenth.
But Brahms combines dark roman-
tic influences with the more
obvious classical traditions.

The second and third movements
contain muchof the deep string
color of the first and various
woodwind solos with alternating
tempos. Movement No. 4, opens
with dark tones and distant
rumbles as the orchestral storm
breaks into a grandiose theme very
similar to the ‘Ode to Joy’ from
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The
movement builds up to a tremen-
dous ﬁnish as'Previn hurtles his
first obstacle as the new music

(Continued from Page 10)

Following is “We Need Love."
which, as you might guess, is
lyrically a travesty. But here, too,
the vocal is undeniably good as
Thomas puts his acoustic guitar in
the forefront.

On the lighter side is “Within
Your Eyes," a mystical melody in
which Thomas puts his famous
ﬂute to work, and “Didn't I," a
love ballad that somehow doesn't
rise to the occasion.

A miserable up-tempo tune is
“In Your Song," the album's
opener. The guitars sound bleary,
like someone sliding their thumb
over a record playing a good
country slide. “One Night Stand"
is a similarly shabby attempt at a
rocker. Thomas can't seem to keep
those electrics in check; if you don’t
have it, don't flaunt it. But
apparently he thinks his band is
made of undiscovered Claptons just
dying to be heard. Wehear them,
all right.

The last three songs turn the
album around, though, or there’d
be no need to be so gracious in this
review.

“Migratio'n’ is a warm tra-
veler’s ballad, as Thomas pines

9

fervently of his desire to not be so
earthbound. The song consists of
gentle harmonies that add emotion
to the vocalist's words, so much so
that when he sings sadly, ‘‘...I wish
I could follow..." one can feel the
finite quality of having to plod the
earth rather than glide over it.

Thomas chooses to close the
album out. as would be expected,
with a typical Moody Blues-type
boomer. a long’ and heavily
orchestrated lament given to
symphonic overtones. Each solo
effort resulting from the group's
split ended with a track like this, so
why not another? The fans
apparently eat ’em up.

And so it is, “The Last Dream,"
for all its formula quality, is
nevertheless good, with Thomas
recounting a man's last living
moment amid the soft blares of
French horns and the prolonged
ahs of a backup chorus.

The refrain picks,up on the circus
melody in “Carousel,” suggesting
the end of one man’s ups and
downs, and rounds-and-rounds,
which taken together is a musical
touch that can be expected from a
former Moody Blue.

in the 86-yard, 11-play drive.

But Dorsett and the Panthers
bounced right back in what
appeared to be the start of a display
ofoffensive power by both teams.
Three plays after Dorsett raced to
the home team's 23, Panther
signal-caller Bob Haygood and
tight end Jim Corbett combined, on
the exact play which earned the

~ Irish their touchdown, for '19 yards
to the enemy ﬁve. From there,
Dorsett took a pitch from Haygood
into the end zone only two minutes
after Notre Dame had taken the
upper hand.

Wilson photo

Devine regarded Dorsett’s open-
ing run as one the game's turning
points and praised the Panther
running back for his abilities and
quick thinking.

“Dorsett has a style of his own
and he takes punishment very
well,“ the Notre Dame coach said.

“On the first play, he ran a simple

dive play that every team uses and
that I don't think was intended to
break to the outside. However, he
bounced to the outside and put
them in scoring position strictly on
his own.“ .
After Pitt's tying touchdown, the
South Bend crowd, which included
a sizable gathering of Pitt fans,

settled back in the 79 degree
temperature and found out why the
Panthers are a contender for the
national crown. ‘

One reason was the performance
of the defense. Though Dorsett,
who was named the top offensive
player by Chevrolet, had a good
game, the rest of the offense, with
the exception of Corbett, did not.

“I had a feeling our defense
would do the job,“ said Pitt head
mentor Johnny Majors. “I told my
assistants that it would be a great
defensive effort that wins the
ballgame. The defense played a
great game and I have never had a
more aggressive secondary.“

With ‘ Cecil Johnson, Jeff
Delaney, LeRoy Felder and Bob
Jury grabbing interceptions off a
struggling Slager, who seemed to
lose his effectiveness after Notre
Dame's initial drive, and his
replacement Gary Forystek, Pitt
began to open its lead, which
reached 21-10 by halftime.

“I think out defense won the
game for us,“ Dorsett said,
“because it was a bad day for the
offense and the defense gave us
good field position.“

It was a good thing, because the
Pitt running game all of a sudden
became shoddy near the end of the
opening quarter. The brief lull in
the action gave punters Larry
Swider, of Pitt, and Notre Dame's
Joe Restic a chance to begin a duel
between two of the nation's best.
Swider, whose longest sailed 52
yards. came out on top by a wide
margin, averaging 43.4 for ten
kicks, compared to 35.9 in nine
punts for his counterpart.

After Swider launched a 47-yard-
er to start the second quarter, and
the Irish returned the ball to their
own 22-yard line, Slager dropped

Top 10 Slips

BY CRIS HALL

If you thought jumping all over
the Irish Saturday afternoon was
easy, wait until you see how
effortlessly the Panthers hurdle
most of the teams ranked above
them in the wire services’ polls.

The Panthers were ranked ninth
and tenth by Associated Press
writers and United Press Interna-
tional's writers and coaches,
respectively, in pre-season fore-
casts. Their impressive win at
Notre Dame, coupled with several
Top Ten upsets, places the
Panthers in position to reach fourth

CORSET ON DORSETT.“ The
players thought it was funny; many
of them cracked jokes about‘ the
Hawk's sexual preferences.

But to Dorsett, it was just
another device to get him keyed up
for the game with Notre Dame. But
he really didn't need any.

“We always get psyched for
Notre Dame, no matter what the
game means,"- Dorsett said. “It's
easy because they’re a national
power and now we're up there right
with them."

And just to draw the ire of the
Notre Dame fans, boost the moral
of the Panthers and just show the
world that he was “up” for the
contest Dorsett wore a green
leasure suit on both Friday and
Saturday. There was no doubt at
all that he was waiting for this one.

But Dorsett isn't about to stop
his antics with Pitt's conquest of
the Fighting Irish. You might say
he's cocky, but poised, and he
knows what he has to do for the
team what he wants for himself.

“The thing I want to do most of
all is to play on a national
championship football team," he
said. “That's my dream-a
national championship and an
undefeated season."

For the past several seasons
Dorsett has tried to do it relatively
on his own. But now, with the
Panthers shooting for their best
year ever. he has plenty of help and
coach Johnny Majors is mighty
happy about that.

“Tony Dorsett is just a great
football player, one of the finest I
have coached," said the four-year
coach. who proceeded Dorsett to
the Pitt campus. “He's been doing
a lot on his own. but this year he's
got an offense behind him.

 

“In the past he has made his
yardage by himself and he
continues to make it by himself.
This season, though, he has an
offensive line in front of him that is
making the downfield block and
giving him more help overall than
last year."

One of the things Dorsett told a
bevy of reporters in the dressing
room prior to the Notre Dame game
was the story of how the Irish had
recruited him at Hopewell High
and how one of the coaches said he
didn't have the necessary tools to
make it as a running back at a
big-time school like Notre Dame.

So the victory'over Notre Dame
on Saturday, as well as last year's
meant a lot to Dorsett, who came to
Pitt knowing he could step right in
and prove to every one that he
could run against any team, even
the Fighting Irish.

Yessir. you might say Pitt's
31-10 win over Notre Dame meant
something to a guy named Tony
Dorsett.

and into the record books Saturday
at Notre Dame Stadium.

wide ‘open action of the first
quarter. But another surprise was
short-coming.

MacAfee open, but Delaney

BX CRIS HALL
Sports Editor

Defensive tackle Don Parrish walked down Forbes Avenue yesterday
morning wearing a T-shirt that pictured a large slice of apple pie and
the slogan, “Notre Dame, Easy As Pie.”

Well, it wasn’t that easy Saturday at South Bend, but it almost was ’

as the Panthers whipped the Irish and tradition, 31'-10.

When someone showed a similar shirt to Johnny Majors a month ago
at a dinner, the Pitt coach only blushed and made several evasive
utterances, but even Johnny couldn’t contain his emotion Saturday
afternoon. ‘ -

Majors, whose recent penchant for secrecy in practice and speech
was irritating to most sports writers and viewed as unnecessary by
many, literally jumped up and down after the victory and even did

some talking.

“It was a delightful game and a great way to star't't9li(e”season,” he
said-

What’s the matter? Does that sound too much like the pre-game

Majors who didn’t want to say anything out of the cut-and-very-dry or- 7

dinary (or have his players say anything at all) for fear the Irish would
be given something to hang on the locker room wall?

Then try this: “I thought we were good to them (the Irish). We
didn’t really make them earn what they got.”

Johnny Majors had opened up a little bit somewhere between the
start of Saturday’s game and the middle of yesterday's edition of the
Johnny Majors Show, televised by Channel 4. He must realize that his
Panthers will be favored to win every game they play this year. The
only one that might be rated even is the one they will play New Year’s
Day.

But Pitt did not do much talking before Saturday. They planned,
scouted, worked out, watched ﬁlms and left the talking to Notre Dame.

Irish coach Dan Devine was quoted by a St. Louis writer as saying, ‘ ‘I
guarantee you one thing, Tony Dorsett won't gain 300 yards against us
this year. He was right—Tony only had 181, bringing his four-vear
total against the Irish to 754, more than most college backs gain in a
career. .

And broadcaster-‘Paul Hornung, a former Heisman Trophy winner at
Notre Dame, was even brasher at a Friday night pep rally on the Notre
Dame campus.

“Dorsett may have scored two touchdowns against us last year,” '

Hornung said, “but he won't do it this year. If he does, I’1l jump out of
the press box."

Hornung may have had second thoughts about that remark when
Tony ran 61 yards with his first carry. And the former all-pro must
have been worried when Tony scored his first touchdown midway
through the first quarter.

One has to wcmder how close to the edge Hornung was when Dorsett
later reached the Notre Dame five-yard line before fumbling into the
end zone.

Meanwhile, Tony Dorsett has not only made the big time, but also
he's brought his team there with him. Now that the schedules biggest
game is over and won, winning the next ten or maybe 11 should be as
easy as...pick your favorite fruit.

OAKLAND (AP)—Rookie place-
kicker Fred Steinfort ﬁlled George
Bland'a’s shoes magniﬁcently Sun-
day, kicking a 21-yard ﬁeld goal
with 18 seconds left to complete a
dramatic rally which gave the
Oakland Raiders a 31-28 season-

Football League champion Pitts-
burgh Steelers.

The Raiders scored three times
in the ﬁnal three minutes after the
Steelers had driven 84 yards and
taken a 28-14 lead on Franco
Harris’ three-yard touchdown run
with 6:43 remaining.

A 76-yard Oakland drive, ending
with Ken Stabler’s third touchdown
pass of the game and his second to
tight end Dave Casper, cut ‘the

-left. Then Warren Bankston
partially blocked a punt by the
Steelers’ Bobby Walden, and
Stabler ran two yards for a
touchdown as the Raiders tied the
score with 1:05 to go.

Fifteen seconds later, Terry
Bradshaw tried to riﬂe a pass up
the middle. Oakland defensive end
Otis Sistrunk deﬂected the ball into
the hands of linebacker Willie Hall
and the Raiders had possession at
Pittsburgh’s 12-yard line.

After two runs by Pete Banaszak,
the Raiders called on the rookie
kicker from Boston College who
sent the 48-year-old Blanda, hero
of so many victories in past years,
into retirement this summer.

Pittsburgh, conquerer of Oak-
land in the last two American
Conference title games, had led
since midway in the third period
when John Sallworth took a lateral
from Harris and ran the ﬁnal 38
yards on a 63-yard touchdown play
which broke a 7-7 tie.

Boaters Lose Opener

They call it the Buckeye State;

At least the Pitt Soccer team
should think so. A nice visit to the
green farmlands of Ohio turned out
to be a stab in the Panthers’
young-but-never-down eye Satur-
day as host Akron handed out a 5-1
socking.

But despite the jab, Pitt (0-1)
isn't bleeding too severely.

“They were a little too much for
us,” admitted head coach Leo
Bemis, “But in spots, we looked

marginal 3-0 score, the Panthers
were able to keep things close,
sparring tightly with the 10th-rank-
ed Ohioans and being outscored
only by a 2-1 difference.

This fact has a little more
signiﬁcance—Bemis used all of his
players that made the road team.

“After the score became 4-0 in
the second half, I played every-
one,” Bemis said. “All 19
players.”

Pitt ﬁnally broke Akron’s defen-
se in the second half for a poke of
it’s own. Sophomore Craig
Connolly, switched to middle-line-
backer this year, was Bemis’ choice
to kick a penalty shot at the Akron
net. It was a good choice.

Connolly let the shot go and

scored the ﬁrst Panther goal of the
season.

Despite the tough loss ‘against a
national powerhouse, Bemis and
his team aren’t ready to throw in
the towel.

“If we can get a good game
going on Wednesday (versus St.
Vincent at Pitt Stadium), we can
build up some momentum,” Bemis
stated. “We need to build
conﬁdence for upcoming games.”

For the players, the conﬁdence
must be established in Wednes-

day's affair. For the coach,
however, it has already been
established.

“I can feel that certain thing is
there," Bemis claimed. “I can see
it. But we have to bring it
forward.”

The victory was the 15th in the

losses were to Montreal, with
former Pirate Woodie Fryman
pitching.

Meanwhile, Larry Christenson

are ﬁghting for their lives in the

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP)——

There's nothing like keeping it in-

the family.

Penn State fullback Larry Suhey
suffered a severe knee strain about
10 days ago, and coach Joe Paterno
replaced him with ‘the freshman
member of the three Suhey
brothers on the Penn State squad.
The other brother, Paul, is a
linebacker.

The youngest of the Suheys,
Matt, made his Penn State debut
Saturday. He did it the hard way,
by playing better than everybody
expected, and a lot was expected of
the high school phenom.

The 209-pound Suhey, who
carried the ball 23 times and gained
119 yards, scored State’s winning
touchdown from the six yard line as
the Nittany Lions opened the 1976
season with a 15-12 victory over

. tough Stanford.

“I guess I was in the right place
at the right time,” said Suhey, who
included runs of 19 yards twice and
22 in his gametotal. “A lot of guys
got hurt. I was fortunate. to get in
and play."

Matt is the youngest of the sons
of Steve Suhey, a ﬁne ‘guard for
State in 1947. He was one of the
most sought after high school
graduates this past recruiting
season. Ohio State’s Woody Hayes
inade a big pitch.

But going to Penn State is a
Suhey tradition. Hayes never
really had a chance. Nor did the
hundred of other colleges and
universities have a shot at the
youngster who lives a stone's throw
from State's Beaver Stadium here.

And after the game, Paterno
said, “Matt Suhey is a ﬁne football
player. We couldn't ask more of a
freshman. He made most of the
yards on his own."

Suhey didn't quite agree.

“There were some giant holes in
there at times," said the 5-10
graduate of State College Pa. High.
“I made some wrong cuts. I should

Still playing in the first half,
Haygood found Corbett open two
more times for completions of 17
and 23 yards as the Panthers
appeared headed for still another
score. Corbett ﬁnished his
afternoon's work with four recep-
tions and 72 of Pitt’s 87 yards

But the drive took an unfortunate
turn when Dorsett took a Haygood
pitch from the 14-yard line and
fumbled at the eight. The ball
rolled down the right sideline and
hit the pylon at the goal line before
going out of bounds. The ofﬁcials
ruled the play a touchback and
Notre Dame took over as the half
ended.

Neither team could generate
much of an offense in the scoreless
third period. Because of the
excellent coverage by the Pitt
secondary, Slager’s passes were

‘off-target and the Irish quarterback

was under severe pressure from
the Panther front four.

“We had a very good rush and
we didn't give them enough time to
set up," said Pitt tackle Randy
Holloway, named the game’s top
defensive performer. “We were

also getting our hands up there and
knocking down their passes."

On Notre Dame's opening drive
of the third quarter, Holloway spun
Slager around, causing a fumble,
which was recovered by left side
linebacker Arnie Weatherington.
But Pitt could not capitalize and the
score remained 21-10 throughout
the lackluster period.

Early in the fourth quarter, the
Panthers began a drive at the Notre
Dame 40-yard line and reached the
ﬁve when the Irish felled Dorsett
for a 12-yard loss to stall the attack.
Long, however, booted a 34-yard
ﬁeld goal to stretch the margin to
14 points.

Notre Dame could not sustain a
drive in their next possession and
gave the ball back to Pitt in good
ﬁeld position after a punt of only
ten yards by Rustic. Dorsett broke
loose for 28 yards and, on the
following play, quarterback Matt
Cavanaugh, who replaced Haygood
near the end of the third quarter,
scored on a keeper from eight yards
out for Pitt’s ﬁnal touchdown with
9:33 to play.

Forystek replaced Slager to a
round of cheers from the Notre
Dame partisans following Long’s
kickoff, but’ could do no better,

missing on his ﬁrst two passing
attempts. then tossing the third

into the hands of Johnson. Pitt's
third theft of the day set up a
53-yard ﬁeld goal attempt by Long,
but the ball fell way short.

With 1226 left in the game,
.Iury's interception in the end zone
ended a long day of frustration for
Notre Dame quarterbacks‘, who in
38 tries. completed only 11 passes.

As expected. Devine was very
down after his team’-s loss of t-he
battle for national recognition. It
was only the fourth opening day
defeat by the Irish since the turn of
the century. the last coming in 1963
against Wisconsin.

“I have no pearls of wisdom,”
Devine said after the loss. “I am
very disappointed. “We played an
extremelygood football team out
there today. It is easy to blame one
segment ' of the team or one
individual, but Pittsburgh won as a
team and we lost as a team. Our
job now is to bounce back.”

On the Pitt side, the injury list
includes: Bonasorte, ankle; Reu-
tershan, ankle; Hutton, shoulder;

. and Parrish, foot. Dorsett limped

off the ﬁeld in the third quarter
with leg cramps, but is okay.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY L.D. SAUVAGE

EVERYONE UNHAPPY

HARRISBURG (AP)-
Today’s beef prices aren't making
either consumers or cattlemen in
Pennsylvania happy. _

The housewife who pays $2 or
more for a slice of meat probably
has little nice to say about a beef
rancher who she ﬁgures must be
salting away the profits.

That makes the cattleman even
unhappier. As of last August, he
was paid only about 36 cents a
pound for beef that was sold to you
as a $2 T-bone steak, the
Pennsylvania Crop Reporting Ser-
vice said. '

Beef raisers lost anywhere from
$75 to $200 per head of cattle this
year according to government
ﬁgures, but their low prices never
quite made it to the supermarket
shelves.
