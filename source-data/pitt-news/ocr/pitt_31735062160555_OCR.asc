ning‘ and the second will be a Midday Series
program on Thursday.

Dr. Jonas Salk has denied
a release by the International
News Service which stated
that he may soon announce
“a major breakthrough in
cancer research.”

‘He squelched the rumor in a

recent interview by saying, “This
sounds like the story of an eager
cub reporter. The rumor was not
checked .with me before being
published and is grossly inaccu-
rate.

_“When we have anything sig-

On Cancer Research Advances

—nificant to report that is of pub-
lic interest, we will do so in the
proper way.” ‘

The article, which passed the
desk of Pat McCormack, INS
Medical Editor, stated that “some
of the material used in polio vac-
cine research for some reason
turns malignant after it has been
growing for a while.

“Scientist have been trying to
ﬁgure-. out how and why this
happens.

“Some have theorized that if the
process could be reversed, there
might follow new knowledge with
which to battle cancer.”

-(Michelosen Honored By Air Force

John Michelosen, football

coach, was honored last week

by the United States Air
Force for his work in con-
ducting a football clinic for

overseas personnel last sum-
H181‘.

Clinics were set up at various
Air Bases in Europe to give the
men stationed ‘there for a long
period of time a chance to see up-
to-date coaching techniques.

A plaque citing the Pitt coach
“for outstanding services to the
United States Air Force Special
‘Services Sports Program—1957”
was presented to Michelosen by
Col.. George M. Foster, com-
manding officer of the 730th Air
Force ROTC Department at Pitt.

Accompanying the citation was
a letter expressing the apprecia-
tion of the Air Force for Mich-
elosen’s service. The letter was
signed by Col. Ralph L. Steven-
son, chief of the Special Service
Branch.

The clinic was held in England
last July with Air Force athletic
coaches and sports directors flown
in from the continent and North
Africa for the four day session.
Michelosen also toured Germany

and France after completing his »
work at ‘the clinic ~

Put A l\ lekle In
It was a busier hour than
usual during the recent Health
Campaign and the line of stu-
dents, faculty, etc. waiting in
“terror” for their polio shots

was getting longer and longer.
The nurses who were rubbing

arms with alcohol and the doc; L

tors who were injecting the
serum were going as quickly as
possible, moving the lines with
fair speed. ‘

Then one of the lines sudden-
ly came to a halt. The nurse
stopped rubbing arms. The line
grew longer until it was backed
up to the entrance. Strained
necks popped up and down try-
ing to see the cause for the stop-
page.

Finally some one _’discovered
that the doctor giving the shots
had clashed outside to put an-

Owl Inaugurates
Plan To Describe

Yearbook Function

.Something new in student
publications will begin today
as the Pitt yearbook inaugu-
rates “Owl Week.” »

To attempt to make the stu-
dent body more aware of
their annual, Editor Bob Hawx-
hurst and Business Manager
Howard Rossen will makean all-
out effort to inform students of
the function of the yearbook, and
what to expect in the 1958 Owl.

The theme of this year’s book

is the individual student. In a
completely different format, the
book will attempt to portray
the everyday life and problems
of the Pitt student.

Many. aspects of Pitt’s life are
unknown even to some of the
students, and one of the purposes
of the book is to reveal these little
known, “but never-to-be forgot-
ten minutes” of college life.

Eigllt-Sided Home
Enlivened By
Mitchell

By KATHY CLEARY

A man who lives in an

‘ octagonal house never calls

anyone “square.”

Bruce Mitchell of the Fine
Arts Department, when not
in Pittsburgh, lives with his
wife and daughter in a unique,oc-

J,_s,,tagonal-shaped house in East
' Lewisburg, Pa.
When Mitchell bought the

eleven-room home, it was run-
down and resembled a typical
haunted house of the Charles
Addams cartoon variety. But, us-
ing his knowledge of the funda-
mentals of art and the aid of an
“interior decorator,” his wife
Olivia, he repaired the house, pre-

" serving most of its former gran-

deur.

Only Two Like- It
“Mitchell’s Mansion,” one of

’ two \of its kind in Pa., is not the

only unusual aspect of Bruce

~ Mitchell's life.

He has successfully combined
his drawing, painting, writing,
and composing talents with an

i enthusiasm for modern jazz and

has been “. . . long recognized
as one of America’s leading jazz
authorities.” A
Born in Scotland, Mitchell came
to the United States when he was
very young and has formed a
great attachment for Pittsburgh.

Father Exhibited Paintings

Perhaps some of hisyfondness
for the city lies in the fact that
his father, Charles L. Mitchell, a

' famous Scottish painter, exhibited

in l\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

«v».

.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\V

paintings in Pittsburgh and Bos-
ton. Some of his works were pur-
chased by Andrew Carnegie and
Andrew Mellon.
Although Mitchell never re-
ceived art instruction from his
father, he believes that he might
have derived an, interest in
painting by observing and pos-
ing for some of his works.
.Among the many private col-
lections in which he is represent-
ed, are three paintings of Pitts-
burgh which hang in the office of
Benjamin Fairless, in the United
States Steel Building.

Painted War Scenes

During World War II, while an
artist war correspondent with
Life magazine, Mitchell was re-
ferred to as the “Ernie Pylegof the
Persian Gulf Command.”

I-le painted scenes of the
Army at work in Iran and much
of the arid landscape of, the
Gulf. These paintings, which
appeared in the war issue of
LIFE, are now in the Library of
Congress, Washington, D. C.

Holds Three Fellowships
_ He has held a place in “Who’s
Who in America” for the past ten
years and is the only artist to
hold all three Fellowships: Gug-
genheim, Yaddo and Tiﬁany.

Although Mitchell is best
known, as‘ a landscape artist,
many of his recent paintings are
based on sketches he has done
at various jazz concerts. He en-
joys sketching the many ab-
stract poses of the musicians as
they play their “far-out compo-
sitions” in addition to tapping
out the rhythm of the music
' that he loves.

When asked about the current
trend of jazz, he commented:
“There’s an exciting period com-
ing up . . . a big future in jazz

the University.

In addition to teaching art
classes here he is working on
paintings to be shown at the
Cathedral in the spring.

According to Mitchell, Pitts-
burgh’s scenery and artists just
naturally go together.

With a sincere expression on his
usual1y—smiling face, he said, “I
think Pittsburgh is one of the
most interesting places in the
world for an artist.”

Teaching and painting are only
two of his present projects.
Mitchell also occupies a position
on Esquire magazine as a jazz

correspondent, writing articles,
drawing and painting.
He has written for DOWN

BEAT, and JAZZ TEMPO, and
has‘ composed songs, two of
which are “Blues of the Haun-
ted House” and “That_Was the
Day My Blues Left Town.”

The versatile Mitchell also tried

gree of success, but decided on an
art career instead.

He explained his choice in an
article in Esquire. “In the late
twenties I got together a trio, ll
did the vocals, and we set some

United Fund is not the only means by which educa-
tion, research and services for cancer, heart disease and
muscular distrophy are carried on in the greater Pitts-
burgh area or anywhere else. ,

Aparagraph appeared recently in the Pitt News which
stated that UF was the only agent for these diseases in
Pittsburgh. This error was the printer’s.

It is neither the opinion of the editors or the organiza-
tions involved that it was the reporter’s intent to mislead
‘donors. . , V»

In fact, this paper has long held the opinion that United
Fund was overstepping its intentions in including groups
concerned with basic research in major diseases.

According to a column in the Dec. 3, 1954- edition of
the News “It is difﬁcult to see the value of a single fund-

. raising effort in such areas as the polio or cancer research
.programs. In these endeavors a nationally coordinated at-

tack is needed.”

This opinion was stated before the permanent estab-
lishment of UF in Pittsburgh. It was speaking only ofthe
Pitt Chest campaign conducted at the University. The
opinion of the paper has not changed.

Heart, cancer and MD are major killers. They must be
‘fought with all the money that can be collected into’ one
place and then distributed by those who are directing the
ﬁght from. a centralized national headquarters.

Under UF the accumulation of local funds is dispersed
locally with little heed to national coordination.

Dr. Paul Dudley White, private physician to the ipresi-l_
dent and one of the nation’s leading heart specialists, said

in an address to the Western Pennsylvania Heart Associa-

problem to be tucked away in a corner of a United Fund.”

I In light of the logic of this argument it is easy to under-
stand the reason for the many letters that were heatedly
and emotionally circulated and recirculated concerning the
Pitt News’ error.

Pro And Con On Union Shop,

Loss Of Power
By RICHARD MATTERN

This year’s national intercollegiate debate topic
is concerned with the outlawing of all present
“union security” laws. The affirmative is therefore
in favor of voluntary unionism, as opposed to the
how widespread compulsory unionism.

As a result of the unique position ‘unions now
hold in our society-—a position which makes unions
exempt from legal liabilities under federal law-
certain abuses have resulted. 5

Now these are not just isolated examples of cor-
ruption, they take place i-n national large—member
unions. The continuation of these abuses is due
primarily to the fact that the new members com-
ing into the unions must in effect support the al-
ready existing evils‘through dues payments, fines,
and assessments. If they do not do so, they will lose
their jobs under a system of compulsory unionism.

Compulsory Unionism

The corrupt union today simply stands between
the worker and “his job. If the worker does not vol-
untarily wish to give money to support Jimmy
Hoffa and Dave Back, he can do so; but in so doing
he is losing his ability to earna living in that in-
dustry. With a “captive” membership, every head
of a union is, in effect, a law unto himself.

Under a voluntary open shop situation, however,

/ the worker does not have to join the corrupt union

in order to keep his job. Thus, he does not have to
contribute to the perpetuation of these widespread
evils. *

Political Contributions .

The case is similar in regard to political contri-
butions and Communist-afﬁliated unions. Why
should a union member who is a Republican pay
his dues to a union which in turn uses these dues
to support Democratic candidates? Why must a
member support a Communist-ridden union in or-
der to keep his job? Present compulsory union
clauses make this possible. .

Thus they must be abolished if the democratic
spirit of vluntary participation is to continue.

Now it is not necessary to have /100% of the
working force unionized in order to have effective
collective bargaining. In fact the ideal situation for
a union is to have, in the trades outside its own
ranks, an appreciable amount of men who are non-
unionists. Such men will check the present oppres-
sion by the union of its members just as the union
checks oppression by the employer. This check
does not exist today, andas 'a result the abuses of

union power continue.

Open-Shop States

It is interesting to note that in the present open-

' shops states those having “right-to-work” laws),

union growth is continuing more rapidly than be-
fore the laws were enacted. At the same time, the
laws permit the members to withdraw from unions
whose views they do not support and yet retain
their jobs. ,

In those same right-to—work states, according
to -present research studies, “labor-management
turmoil”. is less than it was before the laws were
passed. State by state the reports indicate continued
if not better, labor-management relations, as a re-
sult of the “right—to-work” laws——laws which the
union argued would “wreck” them.

The union often argues that since it bargains
for “all” the workers in a unit, all the workers
should be compelled to contribute to the cost of
union activities. This is lige arguing that whenever
a private organization”-beneﬁts any group of peo-
ple, it should be empowered to compel all of the
people ‘it helps to contribute to its support.
Churches, civic and political organizations, and sim-
ilar private groups carry on activities ‘for their
members who contribute no support.

Why should the unions enjoy these special priv-
ileges? The union position becomes even ‘more de-
ceptive when one realized that the union dues are
used to buy Cadillacs for Dave Beck Jr. and to
build $100,000 homes for his father. '

_Loses Freedom

Actually the unionsenjoy the privileges of ne-
gotiating contracts binding on the non-union em-
ployee. The employee consequently loses his free-
dom to negotiate for himself, and the union in turn
demands in turn he pay for having his freedom of
contract taken away.

The non-union member is not a “free—loader” as
the unions would have one believe. He is simply
a captive prisoner.

It certainly appears evident that the major
value of the labor organization to a member lies
in his power to control his leaders. The member
has become today a helpless subject of labor autoc-
racy. This is because he is denied the right and
freedom to refuse to support an ofﬁcial or organiza-
tion which does not truly represent him.

The employee, employer, and the unions them-

selves will beneﬁt from making compulsory union-
i ism illegal. A

  

  
 

  

Voluntary Membership
By GARY HESS

Today many people are calling for the abolition
of the union shop. Whenever change is advocated
one must carefully weigh the reasons advanced for
that change. Hence I would ask why should We
abolish the union shop?

Corruption, political implications involved in
union, ‘and Communist-ridden unions are com-
monly presented as reasons for this change. But
the important point is that these “right-to-work”
law advocates have never been able to demonstrate
that these problems to which they refer are direct-
ly related to the union shop which they wish to
outlaw.

Obviously if the union shop is to be outlawed.
some beneﬁts must result from it. Yet in the
eighteen “right-to-work” law states the corrupt
Teamsters Union remains as strong as in the union
shop states. In these same eighteen states Com-
munist dominated unions still exist and union con-
tributions to political parties still exist as strong
as ever. I

Issue Challenge

Thus I would issue a challenge to these advo-
cates of “right-to-work” laws to demonstrate‘ how
they are going to alleviate any of these problems.
So‘ far these laws have not been able to achieve
anything signiﬁcant along the lines of cleaning up
unions. e I

This is not meant to imply that corruption, po-
litical contributions and Communism do not exist
in some unions. I would be the ﬁrst person to ad-
mit that these evils do in fact pose a very real
problem. But I would offer an alternative plan folk
alleviating these problems.

At present the Anti-Rackettering Act is direct-
ed at union corruption; although it may not have
been as objective as possible in the past, it can be
properly enforced in the future. If more laws
are needed along these lines I would be only too
happy to call for the passage of such laws. Taft-
Hartley prohibits political contributions to labor
unions; there is no reason why this provision of
Taft—Hartley-cannot be enforced in the future. The

point here is thatthere do exist means of combat-

ting these evils.

Meets Problems

But an even more important point to note is
that the Federal legislation whichdoes exist; and
which I feel should be passed in the future meets

these problems directly. But a “right-to-work” lax?”

goes about the problem in an indirect manner.

Whereas the Federal legislation to which 
point makes illegal speciﬁc evils, a “right-to-work”
law advocates a withdrawal from the problem. If
people do not join the union, then this in no way
meets the need for union clean—up.

It is commonly argued by the advocates of
theseplawsthat union growth in the “right-to-work”
states has beeh greater than in the other states.

Such an argument involves neglect of some per-

tinent facts. i ,

“Right-t.o—work” laws have been‘ passed in
states which had little or no unions at the time of
enactment. Thus the growth of union membership
in these.Southern and Western states has been a
result of the natural development of unions in areas
where they were previously weak. >~
we

Effective Bargaining
Another common misconception to be advanced
by these anti-union groups is that 100% union
membership is not necessary to carry on exective
collective bargaining. Perhaps we can have effec-
tive bargaining with only 90% union membership.

But this is not what they are advocating. Re-
member they tell us that a man should not have to
join a union if that union intends to support po-
litical parties not of his choice.

In 1956, for instance, the union movement con-
tributed almost all-_of its political money to the
Democratic party. Yet the union membership voted
in 59 cases out of a 100 for the Republican Party.

Following the afﬁrmative’s argument to its log-
ical extreme, 59% of the_union membership could
therefore be expected to drop out of the AFL-CIQ.
If the strength of organizd labor wre thus cut the
position of the individual worker would undoubt-
edly be hurt. 7

If the United Steel Workers was able to repre-

sent only 41% of itsipresent two million members, '

then United States Steel would gain an unfair ad-
vantage of the bargaining table.

If the union called a strike to enforce its wage
demands, the steel companies would still have a
majority of the men working. Thus, the real power
of unions in being able to call out virtually all of
the workers on strike would be lost. It is certainly
absurd to think that organized labor would not suf-
fer in the process.

And particularly since the strength of ‘unions
would be considerably weakened if this program
was carried to its logical, extreme, I ‘would one?‘
again call for themaintenance of the union shop.

Ups" And Downs With Mankind . . .

In the ﬁrst act of his Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy, The
Skin of Our Teeth, Thornton Wilder has his leading lady ad-
vise the audience, “Don’t take this play serious.” In many
respects this is sage advice. But the local audience would
have had to pause long enough last weekend,‘ in a reﬂective

mood, to credit the Pitt Players with a good, solid interpreta-
tion of that difficult play. 6

 . cast in deline-

World War II.

The capable Player trio of
Ethel Schacter, Jack Joy and

Georgia Adams got excellent sup-
port from the remainder of a large

ating a comedy
which made its
(1 e b u t during

The theme
of the story re-
mains timely,  ,
however, with 
its overtones of "
satire and
broad comedy
upon a mock ‘
tragedy back-
ground.The mood of action moves
from the real to the fantastic to
the moral with disarming, and
often disturbing swiftness.

Wilder contrived this three-act-
er with mankind as the target of
his sensitive introspection. The
initial third has a small«New Jer-
sey home as its setting with all
the normalcies of suburbia in evi-
dence. Sabina, played by Miss
Schacter, is the maid who nar-
rates the action and sets the mood
of lunacy. As she picturesquely
describes the lives of the Antro-
bus family for whom she works,
the wall ﬂats and several props
fly off into space but she blithely
continues her story.

The fantasy quality continues as
it appears quickly that the author
is throwing both modernity and
antiquity at his audience at the
same time. George Autrobus is
busy at his ofﬁce in Manhattan,
inventing such essentials as the
wheel, the alphabet, and the mul-
tiplacti-on tables. Mrs. Antrobus
makes her appearance and is busy
watching her children and keep-
ing the ﬁre from going out.

For, wonder of wonders, in the
middle of the twentieth century,
another glacier is moving upon
the North American continent,
displacing civilization with inex-
orable speed. Refugees pour
through the landscape looking for
warmth and shelter where there
is none. A dinosaur and a mam-

 

-sudden

moth are taken in as pets during
the disaster, but no one seems to
mind them.

The children, Gladys and Hen-
ry, played by Janice Hirsch and
Norman Bloom, present a prob-
lem to their worried mother who
doesn’t want them to catch cold,
what with the Ice Age reapproach-

ing. It turns out later that the-

children are 4000 years old since

they are two of the original chil-

dren of Adam and Eve (Mr. and
Mrs. Antrobus). In fact, Henry
is really Cain, in disguse!

To add to the audience’s cha-
grin at the strange goings on, Mr.
Antrobus arrives home and turns
the scene into a rout with his
changes of mood and
temper. One moment he is all set
to throw in the sponge and put
out the last ﬁre and the next he

is wrapped up in the idea of sav-
ing all of mankind.

Sabina further confuses the
matter by advising the audience
not to take the play seriously be-
cause she, in her role as an actress,
doesn’t really see any sense in the
whole act and doesn’t believe that
the playright did either. The stage
manager bursts onto the stage to
interrupt Sabina’s sudden return
to the world of actuality and
convinces her to continue with
the play.

The action continues to its
merry conclusion, with all hands
onstage and some from the back
of the theater crying out, “Save
the w-orld.” Wilder has cleverly
tossed into the wildness of this
lid lifter a slew of aphorisms and
observations on the state of the
country in war time. Out of the
melee which occurs during the
act, the viewer gets the drift of
the theme—life is confused, but
its goodness usually asserts it-
self via man’s will to survive.

The second and third acts never
reach the peak of hilarity and

meaning which is exhibited in the
first. The former is concerned
with the Antrobusses at Atlantic
City after the Ice Age has passed,
and the latter deals with the grim
aftermath of “Any War.”

Ethel Schacter was skillful as
Sabina, who reappears through-
out the action, like the timeless
woman who is always at the right
place at the right instant. Jack
Joy, must be singled out as the
star of the show. His broad inter-
pretation of Antrobus was played
to the hilt with tasteful abandon.
Georgia Adams was ‘adequate as
his wife, which was all the part
required.

The character parts of Miss

Hirsch and Mr. Bloom were nice- ,

ly handled. Arnie Gefsky, Alice
Gualt, and Mike Litman took care
of other minor parts with zest.

Michael McHale’s direction of
the entire farce was a pleasure to
behold. It was a good, tight pro-
duclion in sum. A special bouquet
to Lloyd Welden,’ whose technical
work in the production was noth-
ing short of superb.

“The Skin of Our Teeth” was off
beat theater, well-done by the
Players. Man survives and strug-
gles and gets by, if only by the
skin of his teeth. Amen. A

DECK THE HALLS

The (lays grow short, the nights grow long, the north wind
doth blow, and a light frost appears on the knees of coeds.
Christ.mas is icumen in, and once more our keen young
minds turn to the vexing problem of (I‘hristmas gifts.

Let us examine ﬁrst the most vexing of all gift problems:
VVl1at do you buy for the person who has everything‘? \Vcll
sir, when you encounter this dilemma, the best thing to
do is seize it by the horns. Ask yourself this question: Does
he truly have everything? Does he, for example, have a
birthmark? A l\Iach number? A lacrosse net? An I-beam?
An S-hook? A U-bolt? A T -square? A Primus stove?

(There is, incidentally, quite an iriteresting little story
about how Primus came to invent the stove. Before Primus’s
invention, cooking was rather a hazardous occupation,
People just built ﬁres any old place—the floor, the closet,
the esc1'itoire——and often as not the whole house would go
up in ﬂames along with the dinner. Primus, a goose
plucker of Frankfurt-am-Main, kept thinking there must
be a more efficient way to cook. Finally, in a flash of in-
spiration, it came to him 2 VVhy not build a device to contain
the ﬁre and keep it from spreading?

 

(\Vcll sir, he built precisely such a device and named it
after his beloved wife Stove. Primus’s ﬁrst Stove, it must
be confessed, was less than a triumph; his mistake was in
building it out of paper. The next Stove, built of wood,
fared hardly better. Not until he made one out of metal
could the Stove really be called a success.

(But even then the Stove was not entirely satisfactory.
The trouble was that the Stove ﬁlled up with ashes and
became useless after a few weeks. It remained for Primus’s
son Frederick to conquer that problem. He invented a
mechanism to remove ashes from the bottom of the Stove
and was thenceforth known to prjsterity as Frederick the
Grate.)

But I digress. VVe were discussing Christmas gifts. This
year, as every year, a popular gift is the smoking jacket.
And what do the smoking jackets smoke? Why, Marlboro,
of course—eve1'y man jacket of them. And why wouldn’t
they smoked Marlboros? Why wouldn’t anybody with a
taste bud in his head? You get such a lot to like in la Marl-
boro——ﬁlter . . . ﬂavor. . . ﬂip—top -box.

Here is no ﬁlter to hollow the cheeks and bug the eye-
balls; here is a ﬁlter that draws nice and easy. Here is no
ﬂavor to pale and pall; here is a ﬂavor ever fresh, eyer
zestful. Here is no ﬂimsy pack to crumble and shred its
precious cargo; here is a sturdy box that keeps each ciga-
rette plump and pristine. ,

Speaking of smoking, the year’s most unusual gift item
is a brand-new cigarette lighter that never needs reﬁlling.
You are scofﬁng. You are saying you have heard such claims
before. But it’s true, I promise you. This new lighter
never, never needs reﬁlling! The fuel supply lasts forever.

Of’ course, there are certain disadva.nta.ges. For one
thing, the lighter is rather bulky—-170 feet long and three
stories high. .

But look on the bright side: As the fuel runs out, you

can rent rooms in it. @ ,,,,.,, M”,,,n_,_n__

Curci Leads Hurricanes

To Victory In Final Tilt

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The Panthersgave the once-dormant Miami Hurricanes
an opportunity to kick up a storm on Saturday, and the
Floridians responded by blowing the Blue and Goldigridders
out of the Orange Bowl Stadium. The ﬁnal score was 28-13.

Fumbles Hurt

The Jungle Cats continued their
fumbling ways which cost them
clearly this season. The ﬁrst couple
of bobbles in the second quarter
were speedily turned into touch-
downs by the hometown Miamians.

Quarterback Ivan Toncic jug-
gled a handoff attempt on the
last play of the ﬁrst quarter.
Hurricane End Bill Poole fell on
the ball at the Panther 17 yard
line. On the third play of the
second period, Curci pitched 12

Next, it was Bill Kaliden’s turn
to commit a ‘miscue. On the ﬁrst

Grapplers ‘Enter Eleven Meets
With W7ilkes Tourney Set First

During the Christmas vacation, theGrapplers begin their
ninth season under the coaching of Rex Peery when they
compete in the annual Wilkes Tournament at Wilkes Barre,
Pa. ,

This year the wrestlers will have a rough eleven meet

schedule. Five of this year’s opponents ﬁnished in the top
ten teams in the Nationals last¢ -
year.

Coach Peery will'have six
lettermen from which to build
his squad. Dave Johnson and
Tom Alberts head the list. John-
son was the Eastern 157 pound
Champ the last two years while
Alberts was National Champ in
the 167 pound class. \

Other returning lettcrmen in-
clude Vic DeFelice, Ted Blen-
kowski, Bob Richardson and Bob
Bubb.

Bob Szekley, Bob Irwin, Alex
Skirpan and Bruce Johnson will

a 9-1 record besides placing sec-
ond in the Eastern and Nationals.
The Blue and Gold were voted
the third best team in the nation
last year in a poll of wrestling
coaches.

Even with such a ﬁne past re-
cord Coach Perry doesn’t expect
the Grapplers to repeat. “Of the
66 points we scored last spring in
the N.C.A.A. meet, 44 of them
were scored by the three Vvho
have graduated,” commented
Peery.

Hennon Stars
For Hoopsters
In Openers

The Panther basketballers
have gotten away to a fast
start in their new season by
whipping Michigan State, 72-
62, and Furman, 83-45. Guard
Don Hennon, the personiﬁca-
tion of a “one—man gang,” is

largely responsible for the succes-
ful debut.

In the pair of Field House vic-
tories, Hennon has tallied a total
of 64 points. Against the Purple
Paladins of Furman, on Friday
evening, the Wampum ace chalked
up 38 points with little effort. Had
he ‘not benched himself at the
eight minute mark of the last half,
Hennon would have broken the
local court record of 42 markers,
shared by Robin Freeman of Ohio
State and Panther Ed-Pavlik.

Hennon was content with es-
tablishing a new mark of 17
ﬁeld goals and leading his will-
ing team mates to a cakewalk
win. Guard Dick VVright, of the
visitors, scored the ﬁrst bucket,
but Furman never held the lead
thereafter. In fact, they didn’t
get another two-pointer for 8
minutes.

The half-time count was 48-18
and the only thing that kept more
of the slim crowd of 1,101 from
walking out, was the prospect of
watching the Wampum native
perform for another 20 minutes.

Co-Captain Jules Pegues was
the only other Jungle Cat to score
more than 10 points. His aggre-
gate was 17, garnered on six ﬁeld-
ers and ﬁve gifts.

The Michigan Wolverines, on
Wednesday night, proved to be
a tougher opponent. With ex-
perience and height going for
them, the Ann Arboreans made
a ﬁght of it from start to about

Rifle Team Scores
Wm Over Dukes;
Simpson Hits High

The Varsity Riﬂe Team brought
their record up to a very respect-
able 4-3 mark as they defeated
Duquesne 1399 to 1384 at the
D11‘-re’s range.

Sgt. John Richardson’s Panther
marnsmen were lead by Rich
Simpson who_ turned in a 288 out
of 300. Close behind Simpson
came the Blue and Gold captain,
Howard Brewer, with a 287. High
man for the Blufﬁtes was Bob
Maguire with a ﬁnal tally of 280.
' Others in the top ﬁve for Sky-
scraper U. were: Gene Ross with
a 275, Jack Clayton 272, and
Chuck Martz registered a 268.

The sharpshooters will travel to
Washington, Pennsylvania, to ﬁre
against W & J and Geneva in a
tri-match. In previous encounters
the Panthers were nipped by the
Presidents 1379 to 1377, but down-
ed the Covies 1388 to 1382.

After this match, only Carnegie

Swimmers Have Three Weelisg
Prepare For Southern Travel

Coach Ben Grady’s swimmers are deep in preparation
for the upcoming season. -«The team has a ten meet schedule
facing top notch competition all the way.

During December only one meet is scheduled and that
with the University of Maryland. In January three meets
are scheduled with two of them away.

On January 10, the team 9
will travel to Virginia Military
Institute and on the following
Monday the squad will partici-
pate in a meet with North
Carolina State.

Last season V.M.I. compiled a
10 and 1 record and in the process
defeated the Panthers 44 to 42.
N.C. State also defeated Blue and
Gold mermen last season 50 to 35.

The lone January home meet is
on Jan. 18 with Ohio University.
The frogmen from Athens, Ohio
were the Panthers lone victory
last season.

The mainstay of the swim-
ming aggregation will be Ed
Robson, the team captain. Al-
though the Panthers lost the
Easterns last year after holding
the title for five straight years,
Robson won. the 100 and 200
yard breaststroke titles that
year.

Miami Received
Presents Eariy

By ED KOLTISKA

’ Sports Editor

 

The Panthers, with the help of the Ofﬁcials, played the
role of the perefect guest and gave the Miami Hurricanes a
28-13 football victory for a Christmas present last Saturday
afternoon.

The Blue and Gold got into the Christmas spirit early as
they rode through the heavily decorated streets of Miami.
But, it wasn’t until late in the ﬁrst quarter that the Panthers
began their role. After the Miami attack stalled, Harry
Diederich punted out of bounds on the Pitt 17 yard line.- Joe
Scisly picked up two on the first play, but Ivan Toncic
fumbled on the second play and Left End Bill Poole recovered
for Miami as the quarter ended.

Three plays later, Miami had their first touchdown on
a Fran Curci to Joe Plevel pass play. Bonnie Yarbrough
added the extra point.

Then before the Panthers had a chance to take a breath,
Miami received their second gift as Bill Kaliden overthrew
a pitchout to Bill Haley. Rig-ht End Phil Geatz of Miami re-
covered on the Blue and Gold 20 yard line. Two minutes later
Byron Blasko scored and Alfred Dangle converted to make

the score 14-0. Both Miami scores came on gift wrapped fum-
bles. e

Interest Revived
In Art Of Fencing
By Student Groups

At a special meeting of the
Fencing Club, an election of
ofﬁcers for the 1957-58 term

‘ was held.

Bob Nemeth, Engr. ’58, was
named president; Jane Can-
dia, Col. ’59, vice-president; and
Helen Esler, Col. ’60, secretary-
treasurer.

Also at the meeting, the date
was set for the women’s team foil
match. ‘

With the announcement of
the forthcoming match between
Chatham College and Pitt, the
women’s team of the Pitt Fenc-
ing Club began an extensive
training program.

Scheduled to meet the Chatham
fencers on Thursday, Dec. 13, are
Helen Esler, Andrea ‘Jones, Jane
Candia, and Kathy Cleary.

The match, originally set as a
round robin, began on Nov. 5, but
was called for time.

Since Chatham is ahead by
two bouts, the three-week prac-
tice time may spell victory or
defeat for the Pitt women.

Nemeth, coaching the fencers in-
dividuallyg said, “. . . Theform is

fairly well established. We’ve got]

WRITERS

Anyone interested in writing
sports for the Pitt News should
contact Ed Koltiska, Sports
Editor in 810 CL. Positions are
still available for writing and
copy work. The editor may be
contacted in his office any Mon-
day or Thursday afternoons.
Previous writing experience is
unnecessary, but very helpful.

In the second half, the Panthers
were all out of presents, but the
Ofﬁcials came up with a few of
their own. Late in the third quar-
ter with the score 14-6, Miami was
forced to kick from their own 32
yard line. Toncic signaled for a
fair catch on his own 31, but a
personal foul was called against
Pitt so the Hurricanes took over
again on their own 47 with a first
and ten. Ten plays later Curci hit

Plevel in the endzone for the third
score.

Then again, a few minutes
later, the Panthers heard an-
other whistle. After the Jungle
Cat attack stalled, ‘Riddle kicked
to “Thomas Mitchell on the
Miami 20. Mitchell returned it
to the 32 yard line but a whistle
sounded and the Panthers were
penalized 15 yards for another
personal foul to the 4'7.

Now when a whistle should
have sounded it didn’t. Terry
Stewart took a handoff from Mit-
chell and tried the right side of
the Panther line. At three differ-
ent times, Stewart was stopped
long enough for a normal whistle
to blow the play dead. lnstead no
whistle was blown. At a few
places it looked as if his knees had
touched the ground but he kept
driving and ﬁnally found himself
crossing the goal line with the
Miami ﬁnalcscore.

The final statistics showed that
the Panthers were penalized 115
yards with most of them being the
15 yard type of personal foul that
either stiftled the Panther offense
or discouraged the Jungle Cat de-
fense.

The loss to Miami gave the
Panthers a 4-6 record for the
season. The record is not rcp-
resentative of the team that the
Panthers had. Only three games
should have been dropped by the
Panthers.

Oklahoma, Army, and Miami
were the run away games. The
others could have been won if a
few breaks could have gone the
Panther way. Now that the sea-
son is over one can look forward
to next year with hopes for a
better record. Better days are to
come.
