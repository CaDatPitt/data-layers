FRIDAY, FEBRUARY ‘I, 1974

BY N. J. BROWN

. The Campus Police department
will undergo intensive investiga-
tion in the next couple months,
with an acting police chief heading
the department until the study is
completed. according to Myron
Skrabut. assistant vice-chancellor
of Operations.

Skrabut also said the police have
been removed from the Health and
Safety, Parking and Security
division, and will report directly to
the Vice-chancellor of Operations.
pending results of the investiga-
tion. A

Curt Graham, assistant in the
department's "investigative divi-
sion. will succeed resigning Chief
Robert Fadzen effective today.

Police Problems Investigated

Also effective with Graham’s-’

temporary appointment is the
withdrawal of the police depart-
ment from Director of Health and"
Safety, Parking and Security
Joseph Gil's control. Gil was
superintendent of Campus Police
until he assumed his new position
late last fall.

According to Skrabut, “Curt’s
[Graham] appointment is strictly an
acting one.” Graham was
selected, Skrabut added, “princi-
pally on Bob Fadzen’s very high
Personal recommendation.”

Graham will head the department
for the duration of the investi-
gation, which will be made by a
study commission as yet unnamed.

US Perpetuating
Vietnamese War;

Protestor Claims

BY LARRY PANSINO

The US government is perpet-
uating the Vietnam War and
programmed the Paris peace
accords to be unworkable, accord-
ing to a member of a delegation of
American citizens that recently
visited North Vietnam and areas of
South Vietnam controlled by the
communist Provisiona Revolution-
ary Government ‘(PRG).

Cora Weiss, who for many years
has worked with the Women’s
Strike for Peace, .said the US
government signed the peace pact
to officially disengage American
armed forces with a minimum of
embarassment and to secretly and
indirectly carry on the war.

“The fabric of American society
was disrupted (by the anti-war
movement)." Weiss said. “Our
government thought it was better
to shut up the American people and
keep the war going on in another
way.

Resigning Police Chief Robert
Fadzen has agreed to serve on the
commission. Skrabut said.

“The time is long overdue that we
take a very long look at the Campus
Police. We expect it to take 60-90
days--we’d like to make this a very
hard look,” Skrabut said. “This is
an attempt by us to come up with
some good, long-term lasting
solutions.” ,

The three department problems
Skrabut identified are training,
operations, and legal aspects of
police work. ,“We'd like to find
three people who are experts in
these fields," Skrabut said, adding
that since Fadzen, an authority on
training, has agreed to work on the
commission, only two other qual-
ifted persons need be appointed.

tration of the faculty in’ the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA) have
gone into effect. following seven
months of deliberation.

Dr. David Kurtzman, Chancellor
Emeritus and acting dean of GSPIA
stated, “We had ﬁve departments,
each autonomous and unrelated. A
student applied to and was
admitted to a particular depart-
ment. I felt this interfered in the
smooth operations of the school
and the students weren’t bene-
ﬁtting. They didn't know each
other if they weren't in the same
department.

“So now we’ve eliminated the
department in favor of a committee
setup, with representatives from
the different areas. The committee
sets all requirements and handles
admissions. We now have core

course for each area, enabling a

student to take courses in areas
other than his specialization.”

GSPIA offers Masters degrees in
four areas: Public Administration,
Public and International Affairs,
Urban and Regional Planning, and
Public Works._ There is only one
Doctorate program. The Public
Administration and Public Works
programs have been placed under
one coordinator.

Kurtzman hopes one result rrom
these changes will be to alleviate
the segregation among the 300-
member student body. “Most of
our international students are
enrolled in international affairs and
most of our black students are in
urban affairs. The past structure

Major changes in the adminis-

tional students from the black
students and the black students

He noted that student response
has been encouraging. “The
students were anxious for a
change. There will be less impact
on them than the faculty. The
faculty will have to adjust.”

deanship of GSPIA May 2, when

Election Appeal Dropped,-A ~

Inauguration Set for Tues.

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

A petition contesting the election
of Student Government President-
elect Mike Furick, filed by ﬁve
students on behalf of write-in
candidate Jeff Sekerka, has been
withdrawn. - .

Sekerka said he had instructed the
students to withdraw the contest
Tuesday night. However, the
official letter of withdraw] was not
received by the Student Govern-
ment Elections Committee (SGEC)
until late Wednesday afternoon.

In the letter to the SGEC, the
students said, “Although we are
not‘ going to contest the election,
we hope that our efforts will
establish a new and more definitive

election code.”

The presidential election was
being protested on the grounds
thatcandidate Sekerka received
unfair treatment from the SGEC
due to irregularities in the election
process, one of those being the
“ambiguous” election code.

With all procedures in the election

«being finalized, the new Board’s-

inauguration has been set for
Tuesday, February 5, in the
student union Ballroom.

Outgoing President Rege Kauf-
man will swear in Furick, who will
in turn administer oaths of office to
his newecolleagues. They are Pat
Kablach, Bruce Keeler, Nguyen
Thi Kim Loan, Paul Lertneky, Mary

P Heider, and Ruth Weinbrom.

Furick, who after receiving input
from many sources since his
election last week, has outlined a

Posvar announces change

Pittsburgh, January 31 -- Chan-
cellor Wesley W. Posvar an-
nounced changes today in assign-
ment at senior administrative
levels of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Jack E. Freeman, President of the
University of Pittsburgh at Johns-
town since 1971, will be nominated
by the Trustees to become Vice
Chancellor for Planning and
Budget effective about March 1.

Prior to his election to the
presidency at Johnstown, Mr.
Freeman was Executive Assistant
to the Chancellor for four years
and. for a time, Secretary of the
University. In these positions. he
became familiar with and partici-
pated in the University's planning
for major program expansion.

In his new role as Vice Chancellor,
Mr. Freeman will be a staff ofﬁcer

reporting directly to the Chan-I

cellor.

At the same time, Dr. Posvar said
he will effect a change in the title of
the office of Vice Chancellor for
Operations. to make more clear
that office's line responsibilities for
programs that support the Univer-
sity's academic mission. The
suggested new title is Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance.

The present incumbent in the
planning, budget and space alloca-
tion position, Arlon E. Elser, will
retain the title of Vice Chancellor
and will be assigned new duties in
the area of federal programs. He
will be responsible for becoming
familiar with federal agencies that
offer support for organized re-
search and sponsored programs, to

the Board take.

“The Advising Center needs a lot
of work,” Furick said. “We should
probably concentrate in that area. A
Who’s at fault when a student still
needs 25 credits for a major in the
beginning of his senior year?”

One of the fundamental problems,
Furick said, was that advisors do
feel
worthwhile job. They are helping a
few students a few hours a week,
and all it really does is take away
constructive research time.

“So I think that some type of
recognition should be awarded for
advising work,” Furick continued.

“Make the job of advising .4 V

desirable and a worthwhile exper-

ience for faculty members too.”
Another area of concentration

Furick is considering is intramural

athletic programs.. He reported
that Chancellor Posvar told a

suggest how to improve opportun-
ities for support from those
agencies, and, generally, “to do so
from the viewpoint of the academic
investigator,” Dr. Posvar said.

“The intent here is to utilize Dr.
Elser’s experience and talents to
meet a need for improving our
access to and support from the
Federal Government, which cur-
rently amounts to more than $30
million a year.”

The University’s Governmental
Relations Office will continue‘ to
have overall responsibility for
representing the University in

Provost for Graduate Study and

Research will continue to formulate _

» Senate meeting in January that a

portion of Fiesta Bowl profits were
to be allocated to intramural
athletics.

“Also I would like to see this
‘Board take a deﬁnite stand on the
union fee.” Furick refered to the
funding of a proposed new student
union partly from a fee attached to

’ academic invoices.

Expressing his concern over the
traditional allocations procedure,
Furick noted that the Allocations
Committee has begun to set up

V deﬁnite priorities.

“In the past no priorities were
written down,” Furick said. “The
Committee members only operated
from instinct, but now they are
working with priorities.

For-example. Furick cited that
some groups. such as the Menls

.. ' Glee Club. should be funded SO-50
- with

the Pitt Public Relations
department because the club is
representing the University all over

’ the nation when they perform.

Appeal Dropped

BY BRIAN DUNN

Inauguration of new Student
Government Board (SGB) members
will be next Tuesday at 11 am in the
Student Union Ballroom. despite
protests from old and new Board
members that the SGB is bowing to
the University administration by
scheduling the ceremony at a time
inconvenient for students.

The Board held its last meeting
of the year on,Wcdnesday. All old
and new members were present.

Student Government Elections
Committee [SGEC] Chairperson
Betty Nelson said the inauguration
would have to be either February 5
or 11 in order that Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar be able to
attend. The committee chose the
February 5 so the new Board will
be sworn in for next week's
meeting.

According to Nelson. the cere-
mony will probably begin with
speeches by Dr. Alfred L. Moye.

Mike Furick as president. Furick
will speak before swearing in the
new Board.

The ceremony will be followed by
a private luncheon for old and new
Board members.

Board member and former
president Tom Bailey complained
that scheduling the event to
coincide with the Chancellor’s
plans was unnecessary ‘kowtow-
ing’ to the administration.

“I thought we were getting away
from Student Government for the
administration." said Bailey.
“When i was president. looking
back on it. we were their puppets.

“So we can't have the ceremony
unless the Chancellor is there. I
think it would be a really nice time
to turn the tables...Student Gov-
ernment for students.

Kaufmann disagreed with Bail-

ey. “To get anything done,” he
said, “there has to be some sense
of cooperation between the stu-
dents and the administration.“

Bailey replied. “is it necessary
for the new Board to sit there while
Bill Rea pats us on the back? I'm
not saying we're adverse to the
administration. You can't be. You
have to play along with them."

Bailey said Boards that have
been at odds with the admini-
stration have accomplished little.
He also said, however. he didn't
feel it is imperative the Chancellor
be at the inauguration.

New Board member Pat Kablach
also disagreed with Bailey. She
said, “I think a luncheon is a kind
of picayune thing to get out the big
guns on. Pd like to formally meet
the administration.”

Furick felt the inauguration
plans should stay as they are.

The whole reporting structure of
the police department will also be
examined. Skrabut said the
commission will study whether the
police chief head should again
report to Gil's division. which is
under Operations. or if the police
should answer directly to Opera-
tions. or if perhaps the authority is
misplaced, and the police should
report not to Operations but
elsewhere.

Skrabut indicated this uncertainty
is why the Campus Police have
been withdrawn from the Health.

study) as objective as possible." he

it's society that suffers.

We’d like to offer
a solution.

Since Population Plannin Associates rovides contraceptives privately by

and a runaway population will be considerably lessened.

If you know male acquaintances who feel awkward about buying
contraceptives in stores, they mi ht appreciate knowing about an informative
catalogue on contraceptives and irth control that we offer for 25¢.

Or they may wish to send for a sample packet of 12 of the most
respected reliable condoms for $3. This assortment, that includes 3 each of
4 leading brands, is sent in a plain package to insure privacy.

Three years and 50,000 clients later, we're convinced that this

basis has Fulfilled an urgent nee to one ofour nation's most serious
problems. We hope you agree.

what the feminist movement is,

When the word feminist is used,
the average consciousness (and
this is by survey) conjures up
visions of lewdness, female mili-
tancy, or social deviancy. This is
absolutely not the case, but the
perception. Reader do you see the
racism? If Ms. Flo Kennedy,

example ofa feminist, as a reporter

 Kennedy

Dear Editor:

Florynce Kennedy came here and
talked about the Establishment
“dividing and conquering." In. the
minority workshop following she
put down one white woman's idea
that attaining positions of power
could help other oppressed

peoples, as “bullshit.” Then she .

elaborated that people in power
don't help the oppressed. Yet, in
opening songs she glcrified
McGovern. a white- male.

In addition, she attacked another
white woman for remaining stand-
ing while a black man spoke. Ms.
Kennedy expressed the opinion
that white women have a habit of

doing that.
When questioned on the omission
of gays, whom she earlier

sympathized with as “the most
niggerized group of women," she
replied that the question would be
better put to big business.

She has been quoted as feeling
more oppressed as a woman than
as a black person. If she came
to raise any woman's conscious-
ness, she has failed. Most woman
seemed alienated from this hostile
encounter.

Abortion

Dear Editor:
Pro-abortionist Roger Johnson’s

: last letter to the Pitt News last term

was a veritable compendium of
errors. Subsequently, I penned
and mailed a careful, scholarly,
critical response to it which the Pitt
News refused to publish because,

in the opinion of the editorial staff, »

it was too “lengthy." However,
one of Johnson's statements was so
incredibly mistaken that it cannot
be passed over without comment.

According to Johnson: “There is
absolutely no scientific basis
anywhere that supports the con-
tention that abortion is murder."

Now, here are_ the facts:

1. at conception, an individual
comes into existence in the human
species ‘that is genetically distinct
from either of those persons [i.e.
the mother and the father] whose
genetic materials have gone into its
composition;

2. this distinct, though unicell-
ular, individual normally possesses
a complete package of essential
human biological potentialities,
and

3. unlike any other cell in the
body of the pregnant woman, it is
in the process of dynamically
actualizing all of those potential-
ities.

These facts provide for an
adequate biological deﬁnition of
human life at any stage of its
‘development: a human being, in
the biological sense of the term, is

a genetically distinct individual
within the human species possess-
ing a complete package of essential
human biological potentialities in
the process of actively developing
those potentialities. Such a
definition accurately describes
what each of us does, biologically
speaking, from conception until
death.

The biological data does not

‘provide conclusive proof for the

contention that the unborn child is
a human being in the fullest sense

of the term land, so, does not '

provide conclusive proof for the
contention that abortion is murder]
because the position, held by many
persons, that humanity essentially
includes a spiritual element along.
with the physical components
deserves serious consideration.
But, contrary to Johnson, the
biological data does lend strong
scientific support to the first two
above-mentioned contentions.

Johnson's naive opinions con-
cerning ethics mightibe excused
due to his apparent lack of
expertise in the area. But his
attempt to deny a scientific basis
for the anti-abortion position either
indicates an unlikely ignorance of
the biological facts on the part of a
Graduate Student in the School of
Public Health or else constitutes a
deliberate attempt to deception.

Sincerely,
T Michael L. Pastorkovich

P)

BY JOHN MORAHAN

The training room at the
stadium. Amidst the bright lights,
padded tables. ace bandages and
adhesive tape, Debbie Heil listens
while a male athlete describes his
leg ailment.

“Well, rip off your pants and lay
on your stomach,” she replies
deadpan.

The guy hesitates for a second,
and then with a smile. strips.

Debbie. the only female trainer
at Pitt. became a trainer “just to be
involved". “I've always been
involved in a hospital scene of son1e
sort. Iwas a volunteer at 12 and a
nurses aide at 16." Being a trainer
to her seemed the logical choice.

Debbie is now in the process of
learning the ‘procedures’. After
this learning period she will be
qualified to be the trainer of_ any
sport--male or female.

Probably her most asked ques-
tion and the one that holds
everyone's interest is how she
reacts when someone walks in...
‘naturally’. Sorry. She treats it
with total indifference. Her first
job as a volunteer was on a Urology
floor of a hospital in a hot summer.
with no air conditioning and no
pajamas. After an exposure like
that nudity is passe.

Her mentor, Tim Kerin dis-
agrees. “She hasn’t been shocked
yet.” The athletes dorr’t seem to
be shocked either. Oh sure, an
occasional double-take results
when a newcomer walks in--but the
off-season football players and the
other athletes treat her like any
other trainer. [I noticed though, all
were wearing shorts of modesty.[

The other trainers (Feld, Bake.
Tardie) feel no animosity either.
She is treated “just like any other
guy". That's the way Debbie likes

 The Ouchless Bondage

it. “Ever_\'one's been real nice"
she says enthusiastically.

Debbie. a sophomore. plans to
go on to med school. But if this
dream fails. she would be quite
content to be a -head trainer.

About being the only girl, she
responded, “Some people think
it’s a joke. Other girls tell me how
lucky I am.” All Debbie can reply
to these absurd questions is an
indifferent “yeah”.

She is concerned. involved, and
quite serious about Pitt’s recent
major change. All I can say after
seeing all the work involved (with
no glamour) is an indifferent
“yeah".

According to Kerin. there were
other girl trainers, “but they didn't
last." Debbie's different. She's
serious. “I'll never quit." she
said. She probably won't.

Kurtzman Initiates

GSPIA Change

ever appointed to an academic
deanship at Pitt was relieved of his
duties.by Provost Rhoten Smith.
The action followed several months
of faculty and student complaints
concerning Howard's “ineptness"
as an administrator.

Kurtzman immediately began

to revamp GSPIA. “The depart-
ment faculties felt’ they were
‘separate’ faculties. They have

since formed a faculty council
which is composed of the entire 37
member faculty. I meet with them
once a month. The students
formed their own student govern-
ment. Before. there was only a
black caucus."

The newly formed faculty and_

student groups became recruiting
grounds for the Provost’s Search
Committee for the new dean of
GSPIA, but the search still
continues.

Kurtzman. who was scheduled to
retire June 30, 1974 before being
asked to assume the acting
deanship. would still like to keep is
retirement date. “If they don't

name a dean by June 30--well, I
just don't know. I'll have to cross
that bridge when I come to it." he
concluded.

S Perpelualing Vieln amWar,-l’roleslor Says    

(Continued from Page I)

"Imperialism doesn't give up
easily. The government still looks
on Vietnam as a station in
Southeast Asia. located as it is near
China. And it's loaded with
resources like fish. meat and
oil--both underground and off--
shore."

Weiss believes American imper-
ialism has become a stronger force
among US policy‘ makers over the
past decade, despite the exper-
ience of Vietnam. “Imperialism is
a hunger that has gotten more
insatiable,” she said.

Weiss's delegation went to
Vietnam last October and was the
first American group to be invited
by the PRG to visit PRG-controlled
areas of South Vietnam. While in
the North, she met Le Duc Tho.
North Vietnam's negotiator in the
Paris peace talks.

“The DRV (Democratic Republic
of Vietnam. North Vietnam's

official name) took the peace
accords seriously." Weiss ex- ,
plained. “They represented

victory for the Vietnamese people.
who have been trying for hundreds
of years to throw out foreign
invaders. Theyjsigned the accords

_in good faith and in thehope for

 

   

       

ii - g

 

‘ 9174??‘

real peace."

When asked about innumerable
violations by both sides of the
peace agreements since they were
signed January 27, 1973, Weiss
replied, “The military violations
have been joint. I’m not going to
defend the North Vietnamese about
this. But only [South Vietnam
President] Thieu has made political
violations.”

Weiss said Thieu has postponed
free elections. refused to allow
people to cross over into areas
controlled by the communists.
banned all critical newspapers.
refused to recognize the PRG. and
continued to hold and arrest
hundreds ofthousands of “political
prisoners," all with the “acqui-
escence and support" of the US
government.

There are between 100.000 and
200.000 of these political prisoners.
according to estimates cited b_v
Weiss. She identiﬁes these
prisoners as people who do not
support Thieu's regime. are
suspected of antiThieu sentiments.
or who break the rules that Thieu
has imposed.

“This is a deliberate campaign,”
Weiss charged. “I was told of
five-minute trials with no jury or no
defense where the prisoner’s
listing is changed from ‘political’ to
‘criminal’ [to sidestep the peace
provisions that call for their
release.]”

Asked why Thieu imprisons so
many citizens. Weiss said. “He
can't stay in power unless he does
it. Their release is his demise."

She also believes that Thieu's

survival is dependent upon his
initiating an all-out offensive
against the communists sometime
in the next two months.

In the last year, there has been
a mutual buildup of military
strength--the US has given about
$3 billion in aid to South Vietnam
and North Vietnam has raised its
troops level to 200,000 in the South.

Since the signing of the peace
agreements. 50,000 people have
died in combat activity. and Weiss
described the ﬁghting there in Oc-
tober as “sporadic but daily."

Weiss anticipates a resumption
of bombing of Cambodia and North
Vietnam concurrent with the Thieu
offensive. “I don't think that
Thieu's army can handle the
sophisti_c_ated_weapons like nukes

(nuclear warheads). That means  

the next step is that we'll have to

come in and use the nukes." Weiss , 

predicted.
She believes the goal of the

North Vietnamese is more peace-‘ 
“The goal of the DRV is to.
industrialize as rapidly as possible V

ful.

and to join the family of nations.”

Asked it she thought
eventual intention of the North
Vietnamese
Vietnam under a communist
regime. she answered, “Probably
not.
should rule in South Vietnam. as
long as everyone is free to vote.'_'

Pitt lO7 Westminster 7l

William & Mary Next Big Loser? g

BY DAVE FOUST

New Wilmington, PA. The Pitt
Panthers collected their sixteenth
consecutive victory last Wednesday
night giving coach Buzz Ridl a
107-71 “Homecoming Victory" as
it was Ridl who once coached the
Westminster Titans to National
Association of Inter-collegiate Ath-
letic prominence. Coach Ridl's
Panthers will put their win streak
on the line when they travel to
Virginia to encounter William &
Mary Saturday afternoon for a 8:00
PM contest.

Ridl’s Panthers jumped to an
early lead of 14-6 as the home court
Titans were successful at breaking
the Panther full court press, but
failed to work the ball close enough
for percentage shooting. The
Panthers completely dominated the
boards via Keith Starr, Bill Knight,
and Jim Bolla affording the
Panthers the run and shoot brand
of ball that has been most
responsible for Pitt's 85.2 points
per game scoring average.

Titan coach Ray Ondako called
several time-outs attempting to
find the key to stabilize his Titan’s
defense and to pentrate Pitts-
burgh’s pressing defense. Kirk
Bruce, Keitli Starr, and Tom
Richards persisted to score from
the outside setting the stage for Bill
Knightwho promptly made himself

known.

Performing with a shoulder injury
acquired at Pitt's victory over Penn
State last Sunday. Knight didn’t
play with his usual vigor, only
playing 23 minutes of the contest.
Infact. Ridl waited until gametime
before listing Knight as a starter.

Mickey Martin. suffering from a
leg injury against Penn State,
dressed but did not leave the
bench. ’

It was Bill Knight who dominated
the remaining fourteen minutes of
the first half scoring at will as he
displayed a mixed offensive bag of
tricks, pleasing ‘everyone with
tum-around jumpers, power lay-
ups, and reverse spin pivot scoup
shots, leaving the contest to a
standing ovation.

The Titan's could manage only
one field goal during the Bill
Knight domination of the game as
the Panthers went to the locker
room with a 53-18 advantage.

Ridl removed the full court press
in the second half and began to
substitute freely. The Titan began
to find the range and began to play
even-up basketball as they found
the right side of the base-line to be
the weak spot of the Panther
man-to-man defense.

Titan forwards Steve Heffner and
Don Tylinski led the offensive
attack for Westminster, but

fouled out almost together with
14:50 remaining in the contest.
Pressing all over the court proved
costly as the Panthers took
advantage of the Titans spread
defense.

Willy Kelly and’Lew Hill quickly
capitalized on this advantage and
commenced to take the ball to the
basket and accounted for 23 second
half points. Pitt guards Keri
Wagoner and Sam Flemming went

to the line several times each as the .

Titans began to stunt and double
team in attemptsto cut down their
thirty -point disadvantage. The
resultrcame shortly as Flemming
converted a one and one situation
for two points and breaking the
century mark with 3:50_remaining.

The contest did not lose its
competitive nature, but instead
turned into a heated full court
“sandlot" affair as the fans began
to head homeward after having
seen enough of the best in the East.

Ready For C-MU Rematch

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
The Pitt Hockey Club kept pace

with undefeated, league leading
Carnegie-Mellon by posting its
second shutout in a row, 3-0 over
St. Vincent College Monday night
at the Kirk Nevin Arena in
Greensburg. Pitt remains four
points behind CMU with a game in
hand and will ‘meet the Tartans
tomorrow afternoon at 1 pm at the
Civic Arena‘ in the first game of
another college hockey double
header.

Pitt goaltender Mark Lieberman
posted his first shutout of the
campaign, turning away 21 Vinnie
shots but had to have help from
defenseman Kerry Browne on one
spectacular play in the first period.

MARK LIEBERMAN

   

Lieberman was down and out of
position after making a save on a
shot from clost in and the rebound
lay close unattended in the crease.
The five foot netminder reached
out with hs stick to bat the puck to
safety but didn’t get enough wood

‘ on it and put the rubber directly on

blade of St. Vincent’s Darryl Coe.

Coe had 24 square feet to shoot
at and fired the puck for the left
side, then raising his stick in the air
in anticipation of the red light
coming on. But it was the ageless
blue line veteran Browne skating
through behind Lieberman to make
the save. ,

“I saw him take the shot,"_
Lieberman said afterthe game,
“and I heard it hit a pad. The next
thing I knew. there was ‘Brownie
kicking it out." —

‘At the other end of the ice,
Vinnie goalie Fred Glinka was
pulling some remarkable saves out
of his bag of tricks. Glinka had
surrendered 16 goals to the
Panthers in two previous meetings
but he wasn't about to be
embarrassed in the final meeting of
the season between the clubs. .

Glinka kept a scoreless tie going
after one period and on the night
stopped 42 Pitt shots.

Pitt captain Denny Browne
scored the first of two goals on the
night early in the second period
and Rick Bagiiiski tallied his first
goal since joining the club in
January. Browne added his second
goal in the final period.

Tomorrow's Pitt-C-MU affair will
be the most important contest to
date for the Panther skaters. A win
over the Tartans would put Pitt just

1

two points behind C-MU with a
game in hand still remaining. It
will again be another rematch for
revenge as Pitt lost their only
league game of the year to C-MU
back in December and haven't
beaten the Tartans since spring
1972.

came Tuesday night over‘ third

Eagles Maul Matmen

BY G. W. STEVENS

The Pitt wrestling team has been
ﬁghting an uphill battle all season.
They have been wrestling some of
the finest teams in the nation, and
as a result they have been getting
blown out of gyms throughout the
East. Last night was another of
those occasions as the highly
ranked Clarion State Eagles came
to Fitzgerald Field House and
laughed their way to their
nineteenth victory against only two
defeats.

The final score was 38-8. but it
wasn't even that close. Clarion
completely dominated the match
with an awesome display of
strength and wrestling ability.
Five Pitt wrestlers were unable to
even score a point against their
talented opponents while four of
the matches went no further than
the second period.

Clarion's Pete Morelli set the
tempo for the match in the very
first contest when he pinned
freshman Jim Flint midway
through the first period. Flint was
a last minutes replacement for
George Bryant who was unable to
get his weight down to the required
118-pounds. Craig Turnbull was
next up for the Eagles battling
Pitt's Raiide Stottleniycr to a 3-0
decision. Soon afterwards. Bob
Bailey found himself ﬂat on his
back and Clarion *1d a quick 15-0
l'.u.d.

Jeff Weis was next up for the
Panthers, facing the first of
Clarion’s NC_AA champs, Don
Riione. Weis did his best to hold
off the 142-pound star but ended up
on the wrong end of a 15-6-score.

Pitt’s Bob Kebr was also hard-
pressed to stay off his back in the

150-pound contest as Jack Davis 

muscled his way to an 8-0 victory.

The only bright spot for the
Panthers was 158-pound Ray
Dallatore who faced Chris Clark
one of the many undefeated Eagle.
Dallatore battled Clark into. the
third period and finally caught him
on his back for an impressive pin.

But it was all downhill from there
as two time NCAA champ Wade‘
Schalles was the next contestant for
Clarion.
Morrel as his opponent. Morrel"
was only able to take the match as
far as the second period where
Schalles chased him
nailed him to the mat.
Strayers soon fell victim
another national champ. Bill
Simpson. Simpson threw the
overinatched Pitt Grappler around
the mat for a period and a half and
then added another pin in his
credentials.

George Calcagnini, 1905pounds,
was the only other Panther wrestler
to score any team points.

“American is tougher than last
year. and Maryland is the toughest
team we will face all season."
coach Dick Bradshaw remarked as
the Panther swim team gets set for
a hard weekend with back to back
meets against American and
Maryland.

They will be theiﬁrst two home
meets ofthe season as the Cats will
swim the American team on Friday
night at seven and Maryland at two
o'clock on Saturday. Both meets
will be held at Trees Pool. .

The Cats are hoping to come away
with a split of the two contests,
although they will try to win both.
It’sjust that Maryland is a little out
of their range. ' I

“Maryland has a team that is

strong in every event.” said
Bradshaw. “They have excellent
performers in the free-style events,
butterﬂy, breaststroke, and Indivi-
dual medley races.”

The only two teams to defeat the
Pitt swimmers at the Easterns were
Bucknell and Maryland. Bucknell
finished second and has already
defeated Pitt this season in dual
meet competition.

“It's tough to swim two teams
back to back like we are." said
Bradshaw. and the coach will have
to make some adjustments. For
one, he won't be able to use all his
best swimmers against American.

Neither Jerry DeMuro nor Walt
Young will see action in the
American meet so that they can be
in top shape for the Maryland

distance swimmers. Maryland
boasts of a distance swimmer by
the name of Matt Glen who
according to DeMuro will be the
toughest one that he and Young
will have to swim against this
season.

Tom Dowd will swim the
distance races instead of Young
and DeMuro, but a lot will depend
on how American does in the meet.
If American starts doing very well
and making it a close meet,
Bradshaw just might go with some
of the first stringers that he did not
intend on using.

The Eagles of American have a
free-styler by the name of Jose
Cortina. who does very well in the
200-yard race. but is not better
than Schepner. although the coach

trainer of the athletic department.
decides what the athletes will eat.

.“l feel we have an excellent
training table,” Kerin said.~ Our
athletes get about one and a half
times what normal students get.”

Kerin outlined the week's menu.
On Sundays. the athletes get jumbo
shrimp. followed by either roast
beef or prime rib on Mondays and
sort of ethnic food on
Tuesdays.

The training table meals consists
of fried chicken or some compar-
able dish on Wednesday and steak
on Thursdays. On Fridays. the
athletes,eat “prime rib, the best
you can get." and on Saturday
mornings during the football
season. they-choose two of four
differe11t breakfasts that include
eight to ten ounces of “bone free
a11d fat free meat."

The regular evening meals all
other dormitory students eat were
described by Scott Walters and
Mike Hormel. two non-athletes
living iii the Towers dorm. Fried or
boiled chicken is served two or
tl1ree times a week, roast beef
twice a week and fish once weekly.
Other frequent dishes include
swiss and salisbury steak. noodles

with beef. spaghetti. lasagna and

pork. -

Walters and Hormel said they eat
beef steaks once a month, shrimp
once'a trimester, and prime rib
“never.” They point out that the
caterers always offer a" choice
between at least two dishes.

Keri11 said that the athletic
department pays the differences in
expense between these two menus
out of gate receipts. Athletes, he
said. eat training table meals only
for the evening meal.

“We're trying to get all three
meals on the training table setup."
he added. \ '

Charlie I-Ieiry. a sophomore on»

Pitt's track and field team. said.
“We get as much as we want at
training table." He also mentioned
that before the advent of Johnny
Majors as head football coach, the
food wasn't as good. A former
football player named Vince
Lainberti said that before Majors
came to Pitt. these meals lasted
only through a sport's season.
Now. according to Mike Carey. a
starting center on the football
squad. training table meals will be
served “all year long"'for all
scholarship athletes.

does not intend to use Schepnerin
the event and give him a rest for
the next day's meet. If it gets very
tight. though. Schepner just might
have to race and sacrifice a little of
the Maryland meet in order to win
against the Eagles.

“On paper. it looks like a split of
the two meets." said Bradshaw.
“The chances of an upset of
Maryland are pretty sli_m. We
didn't plan to go undefeated this
year. and we've already lost to
Bucknell. a team that finished
second behind Maryland in the
Penn State Relays.“

' One of the advantages of the back

to back meets is that Bradshaw will
get another look at some of the
swimmers who don't usually swim
in other contests such as Mark
Kubeja. Greg Ringling. and Mack
Martin as well as Eric Schultz and
Neil Wasserman who will be
swimming in both meets.
Another advantage of the Mary-
land meet is that fans will have a
chance to see some of the best
swimmers in the East. Along with
Glen, the Terrapins have Steve
Schmidt at butterfly who, accord-

  

ing to Bradshaw, is better than  

anything that the Pitt team can put
into that event. Schmidt swam for
York High School, which just
happens to one of the best swim
schools in the state.

In the diving events. Maryland ~ 

has Bob Petrovich. who also beat
the Pitt divers at the PSU Relays.

Last year he won the one-meter I

boards but Pitt's Jack Garrow beat
him in the three meter.

“Petrovich is improved in" the
three meter." said Bradshaw. “but
he is not doing as well iii the one
meter event. so it shapes up to be
pretty close in the diving."

With all their improvement. the
Eagles still don't figure to be that
much competition for the Cats‘. The
big question is Maryland. The Cats
are looking to make the meet
repectably close. while in the back
of their minds the word “upset" is
flashing dimly. The chances for an
upset are very slim. but a
respectable score could increase
the Panthers‘ prestige. and might
even place them up ther with the
top teams of the East.

Tracksters Travel To,

Cleveland Invitational

BY RICK STOUFFER

Baner’s Babie, the college track
equivalent to baseball's Big Red
Machine. travel to Cleveland
tomorrow for the Cleveland
Knights of Columbus Track Invita-
tional. Contrary to what you might
suspect from the name. the
Knights of Columbus is not a
fraternal society for Roman Catho-
lics but rather one of the best
invitational track meets in the
contrary.

Because it is an invitational. only
a select of the “Babies" are
competing.

Nick Martin. who won the mile at
Pitt's own invitational last week.
will be competing in the two mile
run at Cleveland. The field is
expected to be really tough with
Tom Burkle, who beat NCAA
champ Steve Prefontaine from
Oregon earlier this year. will be
among the entries.

George Jupin. who placed second

in the high jump last week at the V

invitational will be at Cleveland

along with the current Field House ’

and varsity record holder Tim

Riley. who will be out to better his

seven foot jump of a week ago.

The mile relayers Don Betterley.
Wayne Ceeley. Jack Patrick. and
Rick Weaver will be at it again
trying to better their second place.
ﬁnish of last week.

In the two-mile relay revenge is on
the runner’s minds. At the

Maryland meet three weeks ago, ‘

an unfortunate mishap occured in
which a Florida man and a Pitt man
got entangled with Florida even-
tually winning. Florida will be at
Cleveland this week with Rich
Markley, Chuck Mozing, Rick
Jackson, and Bob Moore ready to
bury the hatchet [in Florida’s
back.].
