The future of Pitt's Women's
Center is still in doubt as the uni-
versity administration draws up a
proposal to eliminate non-
edttcational services there, while
supporters fight to keep the center
in its present state.

The center may close down on
June 30 because of lack of financial
support. With $38,530 coming

from Pitt’s fiscal year 1983 budget.

and $10,000 raised by the center,
there is still a deficit of nearly

$10,000 in its budget.

A budget shortage almost caused
the elimination of the center in
l98l, but a grant was awarded to
the Office of Continuing Educa-
tion for Women by the Richard
King Mellon Foundation totaling
$46,000 over two years.

A current proposal made by Cyn-
thia Vanda, the center's director,
calls for a continuation of services
relating to higher education
within the women’s center, while
leaving services that don't involve

“How does society get the
answers it needs and make a deci-
sion on scientific issues?" was the
main question posed by Professor

‘Edward P. Radford of Pitt’s epide-

miology department during a lec-
ture last Wednesday in David
Lawrence Hall.

“Obscurantism, fiddle-faddle
and opaqueness" come between
science and the public, Radford
said. “Many scientists write in an
obscure fashion in order not to
enlighten the public."

Radford stated the public has a
place in decision-making on scien-
tific issues.

‘‘I’m willing to let the public
process take place,” he said.
“Clearly we need sotne leader in the
scientific area which we are not get-
ting.”

Radford also said the public has
a blind belief in the scientific com-
munity regarding its research.

“How d()es the public get an
unbiased opinion on these issues?

I

Scientists Biased

They don't," Radford said. Scien-

tists are human beings. They have '

their own internal attitudes that
have meaning for them.”

Radford stated that there is much
bias in scientific studies by the
government.

In the case of nuclear energy,
Radford said, “federal money is
funnelled through federal labs.
They are evaluating the risk and
touting the process at the same
time. «

“Government agencies are out to

.prove what the government wants

them to prove,” he continued.

To get at scientific truth, Rad-
ford added, a science court, like
that of the National Academy of
Sciences, should be brought to the
public forefront.

. Radford said that there are prob-
lems in bringing scientific matters
to the public eye.

“What you have is a show-and-
tell. ()ne person says something is
terrible. Another says it's great.
Some public relations can be as dis-
torting ashiding the truth."

groups.

The proposal was also made by
Sam Deep, assistant to the provost.

“The problem with the women's
center is the work doesn't always
relate to the university, ” Deep said.
“The majority of its direct counsel-
ing is not related to Pitt.”

According to Deep, with _Vanda
as the director for women's interest
in the university, Pitt would
become better accustomed to those
needs.

“There would be an improve-
ment of services to women due to
Cythia Vanda's new role,” Deep
said. “We can use Cynthia on a
variety of problems. Her position
would be tnore of an advocate. We
want to make the university more
sensitive to women’s problems at
Pitt."

Deep added that the proposal
was in the preliminary stages, and
a formal draft should be presented
later this week.

Deep said that an outside group
can take over the use of the center
for non-higher educational issues.

“The university may be willing
to take proposals from an outside
source,” Deep said. “The univer-
sity would pay for the physical part
of running the building, and help
in supervising. The worst net
result is the loss of non-higher edu-
cational services,” Deep continued.

KGB Manipula tes

By PEGGY FERRI

The line between objective
reporting and slanted reporting
has been blurred beyond recogni-
tion through the time-tested and
time-proven techniques of distor-
tion, manipulation, propaganda
and disinformation according to
Arnaud DeBorchgrave, former
Newsweek foreign corespondent
and co-author of the best seller,
“The Spike.”

DeBorchgrave’s May 19 lecture,
“How the KGB Manipulates West-
ern Public Opinion,” was spon-
sored by the World Affairs Council
of Pittsburgh.

“Rat-pack journalism, peer
pressure to conform, a romantic
predisposition toward Marxist-led
guerrilla movements, a lack of edi-
torial guidance and the deceptive
power of TV film footage are some
of the factors that have given the
public a completely distorted
impression of El Salvador prior to
the elections,” DeBorchgrave said.

A panel of journalists, media
critics and government officials
who met in mid-March agreed that
the press today lacks objectivity
and fails to do its homework in
reporting foreign affairs, thus
creating a cycle of negativism at
home and abroad, he added.

The word “disinformation,”
according to DeBorchgrave, was
never seen in print until “The
Spike,” a novel that he said is based
on accurate information, was
published.

He later explained the mecha-
nisms of disinformation and the
differences between it and
propaganda.

“Propaganda,” he said. “is the
big lie that if you repeat it enough,
some people start believing it. Dis-
information, however, must con-
tain a kernel of truth in order to be

Center’s Future Dim

However, this idea has not
caught on with the supporters of
the wotnen's center, according to

jean Markus. Markus, a former"

intern at the center, said that the
center's duties should remain the
same.

“My point of view is that the

women's center should stay as«it
is." Markus said. “We don't know
what will happen. I see the possi-
bility that another organization
could l)e the best thing for the
center—then again, it could be the
worst. It's a terrible position to be
in." -
Trudy Bayer, a researcher at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic who has a “special" interest
in the center, said that she is not
certain of what is the best move for
the center.

“Right now, I’tn undecided,”
Bayer said. “It's still unknown to
me if Cynthia's move to the provost
office would help or hurt the
center."

At their meeting Monday night,
the Committee to Save the
Women’s Center planned strategy
to prevent the closing.

Markus suggested trying to
“buck the system” and meet with
Chancellor Wesley Posvar without
going through the provost’s office,

effective. Around that kernel—as
described in “The Spike”—you
weave a tissue of falsehoods,”

“Disinformation,” he con-
tinued, “is not prevalent in terms
of agents, but prevalent in terms of
unwitting dupes—people who let
disinformation, be planted on
them." ‘ I

According to DeBorchgrave,
censorship by omission is the most
“pernicious” form of disinforma-
tion. He noted that the Feb. 10 Wall
Street journal devoted its entire
editorial space to the “brazen disin-
formation campaign going on in
ogr media over El Salvador.”

Focusing briefly on Cuba,
DeBorchgrave quoted a recent
announcement that linked the DGI
(Cuban secret service) to the South
Florida drug racket. He said this is
soon to come out in the open judi-
cial proceedings.

“The _DGI,” he explained,
“.skims profits from some of the
drug deals to supply American-
made guns to Marxist guerrilla
movements in Central America."

According to DeBorchgrave,
Thomas Enders, assistant secretary
of Internal American Affairs,
recently testified on the drug
connection.

DeBorchgrave said there is now
“scholarly confirmation of the
ideological tilt of TV stars and
bylines who pontificate daily on
the shape of the world.”

He added that a “major news
study” conducted under the auspi-
ces of the Columbia University

- Research Institution on Interna-

tional Change involving 240 jour-
nalists raised some serious
questions aboutjournalism’s qual-
ification as "an objective profession.

SHS Fee Hiked; SGB Upset

By NATALIE FRIEDMAN

The student health fee, a manda-
tory fee for all Pitt full-time stu-
dents excluding those in the School
of General Studies, was recently
increased from $21 to $30 per term,
a 42 percent increase.

Todd DeLuca, president of the
Student Government Board (SGB.),

attended the May I2 meeting of the,

Board of Trustees when the deci-
sion tQ praise the health fee was
finalized. '.

DeLuca, however, claims he was
not given an agenda for the meet-
ing nor told of any plans to discuss
the student health fee. S I .

He said that he was unprepared
to (liscttss a recently completed sur-

- vey conducted by the SGB dealing

 

.in a prepared fashion,"

with the Student Health Service.

“If a madatory fee is to be
increased, we should know the
time and place to make a statement
DeLuca
said.

-The SGB chose to conduct its
own survey when the Student
Health Advisory Board chose not
to include a’ few questions that the
SGB asked them to put on their
survey, DeLuca said.

The SGB survey, which began in
March and was completed in April;
included 386 participants. Some of
the results from that survey
include: ‘ .

According to DeLuca, “The Stu-

about the increase so that it can
make an educated opinion about
it.”

In addition to examining teacher
evaluations and dormitory dam-
ages, looking into the Student

Health Service was a major goal of-

the SGB since its first planning ses-
sion, DeLuca said. «

EORUM: Rating The Superpowers

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

in light of the recent increased

public interest in nuclear disarma-

ment, and with START (Strategic
Arms Reductions Talks)" beginning
possibly as early as this summer, one
question on a lot of people's. minds is
that of the military capability of the
superpowers. _

lf an arms freeze were to take effect
immediately, would the United
States or the Soviet Union be at an
ge? Which side would be
more capable of winning a war if one
began today?- in terms of conven-
tional as well as nuclear weaponry,
who possesses more—us'or them?
An article recently written by Admi-
ral Noel Gaylor, former commander-
in-chief of the United States naval
forces in the Pacific andformer direc-
tor of the National Security Agency,
discusses some of the built-in diffi-
culties of determining which" side is
ahead. He also discussed what a val-

uable starting point for arms reduc-

tion talks would be.

“How do you classify weapons,
and what weapons do you count?
For example, is the Russian Backﬁre

er capable of intercontinental »

range, as our military contends, or is
it a medium-range aircraft, as the
Russians insist?” -Gaylor asks. “Do
you count as ‘strategic’ those long-

range weapons that cross, oceans ,

(our idea) or any weapons that can
reach Soviet soil no matter where
they start from (their idea)?

"What is fair and equal? We Ameri-
cans talk about equal effectiveness in
terms of weapons systems, while the
Russians talk about equal security,
and the way they define their security
needs is unacceptable to us," Gaylor
continued. -

send, a member of Pitt’s Arms Race
Study Group believes that not only is
the question of military superiority
between the superpowers difﬁcult to
answer, it is irrelevant—considering
the ability of both sides to blow up the
world with nuclear weapons.

“If we were talking in an era where Z

all we had was conventional wea-
pons, a question like that has mean-
ing," Townsend said. "In our era,
where there are nuclear weapons on
both sides, it has no meaning. Sub-
stantial confrontation between the
two superpowers is probably going
to turn into a nuclear war, and there
are no" winners in a nuclear war-
neither side is ahead."

Townsend believes that a U.S.-

T U.S.S.R.. confrontation without the

use of nuclear weapons is possible,
but it would have to be fought far
away from either country.

“ltwould have to be a very peri-
pheral war,” he said, "maybe in Afgh-
anistan or the Falkland Islands. (A
war using only conventional weap-
onry) could conceivably happen in
one of those places.”

Townsend believes that the Rea-
gan Administration's contention that
we are militarily inferior to the Soviets
is a case of assuming the worse while

.not really knowing what the other

side has.

“I can’t imagine any military leader A

or commander-in-chief looking at
any military situation such as ours
and giving any other conclusions,"
he said.
He suspects that President Reagan
is calling the United States militarily
- inferior to justify spending money on
weapons so that the U.S. can nego-
tiate reduction talks from a position
of strength. Townsend, however,
thinks Reagan is building a military
that we do not plan to disarm.
“How do you go about assuring

that your side will win? You should
have more weapons than they do,"
Townsend stated.

Townsend, who describes himself
as "not too optimistic" about the
arms race situation, fears the super-
powers may have to start ﬁghting
before they start talking.

"Maybe what the world needs is a
small nuclear war someplace that
would lead to the concern (that is
necessary to have successful disar-
mament talks). Maybe we‘ll have to
explode a few nuclear bombs first."

Major Joseph’ E. Kieman, head of
R.O.T.C. department of military
science at Pitt, believes that although
it is difficult to determine military
superiority between the United
States and the Soviet Union, we are

- not faced with an entirely hopeless

needs a small
nuclear war...”

situation that is destined to end inthe
destruction of the earth.

“l think it’s not a matter of which
one has the most—by numbers, the
Russians-but it’s amatter of quality
of that which you do have,” Kieman
said. “If what you have is better but
your ability to manufacture is not so
good that you have to make ten
times as much to get the same qual-
ity, there is not much difference.

“I don't think any military expert
would‘ disagree that in sheer
numbers, were outnumbered," Kier-
nan continued. “Whether the quality
makes up for that difference is
harder to say. I believe that we have

, the quality to overcome that second

place in numbers.

"You can't always say that people
with the most weapons or the most
men means you're going to win—a
lot of it depends on sheer brilliance.
There are many, many ‘ factors
involved in conﬂict," he added.

Conventional rather than nuclear
weapons will play a large role should
fighting between the superpowers
occur, Kieman believes.

“Conventional weapons will have
the primary role initially,” he said. “I
do not believe that the Soviet Union
would launch any kind of attack with
a nuclear ﬁrst-strike. I don't think the
leaders of the Russian people or the
leaders we have in this country are
stupid enough to put themselves in
the position (to destroy the world
with nuclear arms)."

Professor Joseph Koffey of public
and international affairs believes that
a great deal of factors make it difficult
to distinguish military superiority
between the superpowers.

“lf one's looking at the U.S. and
U.S.S.R., the Soviets have more men,
tanks and guns than we do. (They
also have) more organized ground
units than we do. In terms of air
power, they have somewhat more
planes than we do. Their navy is infe-
rior to ours-—we have fewer ships but
larger ones," Koffey said.

"Then we have to look at all other
kinds of things—the quality of man-

power, the kind of training they get.

and the morale of the people. We
tend to think we’ re ahead in the qual--
ity of much of the equipment. There
are lots of factors outside of

numbers." Koffey continued.

"Certainly in the strategic ﬁeld
we’re not inferior; we are behind in a
couple of things. but in strategic mil-
itary power we are not inferior,” he
said.

Koffey believes that the location of
the war is also a determining factor.

For example, if there were to be a
war in Cuba, the Soviets would have
better weapons, but the United
States would have the strategic
advantage, according to Koffey.

if the war were in Afghanistan on
the other hand, the Soviet Union
would have easier access than the
United States, Koffey stated.

Another example of the location
factor, according to Koffey is the cur-
rent ﬁghting in the Falkland Islands:
the British have a more powerful
navy and generally superior military,
but they have to send it thousands of
miles away, whereas Argentina has
the advantage of being close by.

A possible war between the super-
powers without using nuclear wea-

pons is conceivable to Koffey "if it's a i
very small war in a very remote _

place."

, He believes that it is “highly
unlikely" that a warcould begin in
Europe and not lead to the use of
nuclear weapons.

Also “very unlikely” is an arms
freeze because the U.S. and the
Soviet Union are on “different cycles
of development," according to
Koffey. E ~

"The So\n'ets are ﬁnishing one
round of deployment. There are
many (such as Reagan, Haig and
Weinberger) who would argue that a
freeze would leave us at a disadvan-

~tage. A freeze is likely to be very

unpopular politically,” Koffey added.

“I honestly feel that the United
States let the Soviet Union build up
faster than it did and that led to this
talk about strength." ‘

Budget Cuts

Hurt Poor Mostly

By MARK STROUP

‘-‘I think there’s an enormous
amount of misinformation about
(the federal budget)," Stuart Cohen
of the Western Pennsylvania Fair
Budget Commission said yesterday
in a lecture at the Cathedral of
Learning.

_ The Reagan Administration’s
budget cuts shouldn't be directed
towards social programs and enti-
tlements such as Medicaid, food

stamps and the Aid to Families

with Dependent Children (AFDC)
program, Cohen said.

“Entitlements are rights,” he
said. _

Cohen explained that there are
two different types of entitlements,
benefits such as social security,
unemployment insurance and
Medicare, that do not depend on a
person’s income, and programs
such as Medicaid, AFDC and food
stamps, that do distribute benefits
according to income.

Cohen said the most difficult

entitlements to cut are those not
related to income because they are
received by the largest ‘and most

represented group from the public .

sector.

The entitlements that will lose
the most because of budget cuts are
those that benefit the poor, Cohen
said. These include food stamps,
Medicaid and AFDC. »

Cohen questioned the rise in the
military’s share of the budget and
military expansionism. V

“Military expenditures are
inherently inflationary,” Cohen
said. “The commodities produced
by the military are not circulated in
the economy.” I ‘ I

Tax expenditures in the form of
“incentives to the private sector of

The study, according to
DeBorchgrave, concluded that the

on the methods used in the study.

KGB drew up a long—range plan
_whose goal was to “bring_about the
defeat of the main enemy (US and

DeBorchgrave stated the

“increased recruitment of agents,

Another idea of the group was to
write letters to university officials

_— ."tious participants gave per-

center open.

Several committee members said
the center provides counseling
directly to women on gender-
related matters. It also gives
women a information and referral
network for other services available
and provides groups with a meet-
ing place, according to Bayer.

According to a survey taken in
1979 by the center, 10,640 women
contacted the center through coun-
seling, classes, conferences, tele-
phone and drop-ins.

The center also publishes a
monthly newsletter, Synthesis.

the Oakland area. According to_

Markus, 400 petitions have been
turned into the office and “a lot
more are still out."

The committee also made some
long-term plans. One of these
proposals would combine the ser-
vices of the center so that women of
Carlow, Chatham and Carnegie-
Mellon could utilize it.

Vanda was absent from the meet-
ing Monday, and according to
Bayer. this is due to her position on
who should be working on keeping
the center.

“She feels the women's center
should be maintained by the
women who use it,” Bayer said.‘

Vanda was unavailable for
comment.

Bayer said that the centerimust
remain in operation, either in its
present form or controlled by the
provost’s office. ,

“If the center wasn’t there, it

Ad Hoc Committee To Examine Geog.

By REGINA KVITKOVICH

The United Faculty, the recently
established Pitt faculty. organiza-
tion, selected an ad hoc coimnittee
"to look into one Lons" concern-
ing the administration's decision
to close the geography department,
according to United Faculty Co-
chairman Philip Wion.

The committee was formed dur-
inga United Faculty meeting Mon-
day. The meeting was closed to the
media. Wion said that United
Faculty action in the matter was
“possible," and that the group is
interested “especially in strength-
ening the faculty voice in such
matters.”

History professor Edward
Muller spoke on “Implications for
Faculty and the University of
Efforts to Close the Geography
Department” at the meeting.
Muller was nominated to be the
new head of the geography depart-
ment by a Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) ad hoc committee
studying the department. The ad
hoc committee recommended the
department he revitalized, but FAS
Dean Jerome Rosenberg decided to
close the department in an effort to
trim the FAS budget, as he had pre-
viously proposed.

Muller was asked to speak
“because he is knowledgeable
about the history of the geography
department situation,” Wion said.
He added that to be able to take the

proper action, the United Faculty.

needed more information.

“The United Faculty is con-
cerned about the administration’s
decision to close the department,
and we’re especially concerned that
faculty committees’ recommenda-
tions to revitalize the department

have been ignored,” Wion said.

“The faculty will have another
opportunity to look closely at the
question.”

Rosenberg is preparing a formal
Planning and Resource Manage-
ment Systems (PRMS) proposal to
close the geography department.
The proposal is first submitted to
the provost, then the Office of

"The University Senate has yet
to receive a copy of the (PRMS doc-
ument), which is still being
drafted.” Wion said. "I hope the
Senate will not receive it in the
summer, when most faculty
members aren't at the university.”

“If we had collective bargaining,
the role of the faculty would be
stronger,” he said.

Pitt faculty is moving closer to
collective bargaining. according to
Wion. By state law, 30 percent of
Pitt faculty in ust sign cards author-
izing the organization to petition
the state Labor Relations Board to
establish a collective bargaining
agent. Wion said that between 29 to
30 percent of the faculty have now
returned such cards.

“We expect to go over (30 per- '

cent) next week," Wion said.

TheRising Costs
For Students

Is Pitt becoming a school for the elite?

That question was raised recently in a‘ letter to the
editor in The Pittsburgh Press. It was written by the
father of a former Pitt student who was upset that,
for the 12th time in 13 years-, tuition will be raised.

Pitt’s 60-member board of trustees voted on May
12 to increase tuition $240 for next year, raising
tuition» from $1,970 to $2,210.

The reasons cited for the increase are most likely
identical to the ones mentioned every year: lack of
adequate state support and inflationary woes.

Despite their repeated use, there are valid reasons
for tuition hikes. The arguments given against the
hike by one board member proves this point.

Trustee Alfred E. Lawson voted for the third_year
in a row against the tuition increases. According to
Lawson, Pitt’s tuition is the third highest among 165
public colleges and universities throughout the

' country. . - ‘
_ Pennsylvania however ranks among the lowest in
appropriating money for higher education.

Coupled with the rising costs of running a univer-
sity, what all this may amount to is that tuition
increases are something we should get used to, if we
are not already. It also means that the university is
going to have to scrutinize itself for areas to cut.

This is much easier said than done. Departments
and services that become targeted for cuts are under-
standably outraged, and often the battle becomes one
not of finances, butione of emotions.

" Undergoing this kind of economic scrutiny at
present are the geography department and the
women’s center. 0 .

It’s important to note the difference in approach
by the administration in dealing with these. two
areas. A faculty committee. was organized by FAS
Dean Jerome Rosenberg. to review the options for the

I geography department; yet those findings were
ignored as Rosenberg recently saw fit ’to go ahead
with his proposal to eliminate the department
anyway.

The women’s center is another matter. It was the.
center of controversy when it. was first threatened
with termination last year. The center’s supporters
rushed to its aid and criticized the university for not
supporting it. s .

While we believe the university should offer sup-
port forwomen, there are some questions about the
center that need answered. A

One such question is where the money for the
center goes. Most of the nearly $40,000 allocated for
fiscal year 1983 goes for director" Cynthia Vanda’s
salary. A

If cutting the director's salary means the end of the
center, then perhaps the center should explore other
possibilities for funding and operating, along with
maintaining efforts to keep its allocation.

It would be unfortunate to see good programs roll
over and die as a result of budget cuts. ’

Notwithstanding financial constraints, we hope-

that the university will help those areas in develop-

ing ways to survive and cope with their diminishing

Women’s Center Needed ‘

(Editor’s note: The writer is the
University Chaplain and Director
of ‘the University and City
Ministries.)

Dear Editor: _

I began my ministry as a Univer-
sity Chaplain s in Pittsburgh
approximately four months ago.
During this period I have been
impressed by the numerous times
the Women’s Center of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has been por-
trayed as a significantly positive
and constructive force in the lives
of so many persons. As a minister
who has long appreciated the spe-
cial concerns of women,’ especially
on campus, I was pleased that the
Women’s Center existed within the
university infrastructure in provid-

ing a presence and service specifi-

Tobias —vs.-
The Media

Dear Editor:

We would like to commend The
Pitt News for the superb handling
of the‘ story about Pitt faculty
member Richard Tobias, newly

elected president of the Senate

Council.

In the May 19 article, Tobias
mysteriously refused to comment
to The Pitt" News about his
appointment. The article quoted
him as saying, “I just will not talk
to The Pitt News.” His refusal cer-
tainly iustifies the use of an editor-
ial cartoon to defame his character.

We can only wonder why Tobias
would act in such a selfish manner.
If he had been a diligent reader of
past issues of The Pitt News, he
would have certainly discovered
that it is a publication beyond
reproach. Past issues of The Pitt
News reveal nothing but fair and
equitable treatment of university
administrators and faculty.

The sensationalized expose of
Chancellor Posvar's “ties” with the
Central Intelligence Agency, for
example, was done in fine taste. We
remember vividly the accompany-
ing photograph of our chancel-/
lor—a -mugshot that would have
done‘ justice to any criminal on
death row.

Mr. Tobias must have missed
this article. Had he read it, he
would have jumped at the oppor-
tunity to be interviewed by The Pitt
News staff so that he too could have
been featured at length. With
Tobias’ cooperation, it may have
even been possible to obtain a mug-
shot of him, thereby saving The
Pitt News artists some trouble.

cally designed to give support and
guidance. _ . .

However, it now appears that the
Women’s Center programs may be
gutted, or possibly the Center ter-
mi-nated, before the ‘fall semester
begins. Although fiscal constraints
appear to be the culprit, it is diffi-
cult to understand the efficacy of
such reasoning. In a university
with a multi-million dollar operat-

ing budget, of which only an inex- I

cuably tiny amount is devoted to
the Center, and with a current stu-
dent population of approximately
fifty percent women, it would seem
wise to discuss expanding Center
programs and services. The tragic
irony is that just the reverse is true.

Aside from any philosophical
considerations, and many could be

offered, the issue of the Women’s ,

Center is one of pragmatics. To
maintain viable programs and ser-
vices for women within their own
facility, and in direct response to
the uniqueness of women’s issues,
is to the advantage of the university
and society as a whole. A dynami- '
cally developing and_ responsive
university, academia, economy,
vocational options and workforce
demand nothing less. 
In this regard, I certainly hope
that those responsible for the des-
tiny of the Women’s Center recon-
sider and permit those of you who
may wish to indicate your support

of the Women's Center of the U. , =»

versity of Pittsburgh, please con-
tact the University’s Chancellor’s
office and the Women’s Center
immediately. ‘

T.A. Defends T.A.

Dear Editor:

It is a shame that people do not
go through the proper channels
when they have a complaint. I was
dismayed when I read the letter by
Susie Smith, which criticized her
teaching assistant in an Italian’
course, and which should have
been rewritten and addressed

directly to him and not to the stu- .

dent body as a “warning” to
incoming freshmen.

I have been a teaching assistant
in the Italian department for one-
and-la-half years and am aware that
students sometimes become frus-
trated and, feel misunderstood, par-
ticularly when dealing with a
foreign language. The best solu-
tion, however, is not a nasty letter
full of accusations which may or
may not be true. ,

We do expect students to know
English grammar before they come
to class. If they have forgotten it, I
suggest they review it, with a tutor

' second with the appropriate pro-

‘standing between students and

if necessary. We also emphasize
conversational skills, and we are
not required to write everything we
say on the blackboard. I’m sorry
that this seems hard to understand,
but I'll be glad to meet with ‘Ms.
Smith and explain the reasons, if
she would liketodiscuss the 
further. . I “ 
_ I hope that, in the future, stu-
dents with problems will seek a
resolution first with the teacher,

fessor who is working with the
T.A.s, and third with the depart-.
ment chairman, if necessary.

By going through the proper
channels, instead of “slinging
mud,” most legitimate ‘complaints
will result in improved under-

teachers.

The Inside Story:  

  The ,University.iArchives

Hidden away in a far corner of.

Hillman Libi‘ary’s third floor is the
university’s Archives Service Cen-
ter, a place where there is no card
catalogue and few librarians.
There are, instead, records and
office-files of the university and its
departments, books, photographs
and memorabilia, as well as‘bro—
chures put out by university gradu-

ate schools,’ and newspaper,

clippings mentioning the university .
And archivists.
“We keep copies of every univer-

sity publication that comes out, not

only The-Pitt News and University
Times, but the newsletter of the
School of Social Work, and the U...
versity of Pittsburgh Press books,”
according to Lee Jamison, assistant
archivist. ’
One of the three main divisions of
the Archives Service Center along
with The Archives of Industrial
Society, and the Union of Electrical
Workers‘ (U.E.) Archives, the Uni-
versity Archives houses the “per-
manent, official records of the
university,” according to Jamison,i
who has her master’s in library
science, plus special training in
archives management. Jamison
- joined the archives in 1975. ,
The Records Center, located in
the Cathedral of Learning and a part

L of the University Archives, stores

records for various university
departments temporarily.

“Certain records have to be kept
a number of years for legal reasons,”
Jamison said.

The University Archives, how-
ever, isn’t a dead storage file for uni-
versity offices to send files they no
longer have room to keep.

“After we get the records, we go
through them and throw out every-

thing that’s not pertinent, and keep L

all that has hilstorical—we call it
‘evidential’——value,’_’ Jamison said...

Records maintained by the Uni-
versity Archives are described in
inventories that are available for stu-
dent use in the third floor reading
room of Hillman Library.

Anyone doing research can use
any of the files that are open. Some,
however, such as the chancellor’s
files are kept closed for 25 years for
a number of reasons, according to
Jamison. ‘

“If anyone is interested in using
those files for research, it should be
after enough time has "passed to
allow a historical perspective,”
explained Jamison.

The files are also kept closed to
insure privacy and protection for
those still living, according to Jami-

son.

‘‘We keep copies of every
university publication that
comes out...”

“Dr. Fitzgerald’s are the last ones
that are open now,’f said Jamison.
The University Archives was
begun in 1966, long after the need
for an archives center had been rec-

, ognized by most of the university

librarians.

“The librarians were always
aware that you should keep
records. They'started keeping

things written by the facul_ty. Our T

yearbooks date back from the first
one, which is 1907,” Jamison said.

Among those things kept by the
librarians were copies of The Pitt

News dating back to before the first
World War, when it was known as
The Pitt Weekly.

The Archives Service Center was
built by Dr. C.W. Stone, director of
the libraries from 1965 until Sep-

tember 1971.
Despite the diligence of the librar-

ians, however, the _ basis for the
archives was a history of the univer-
sity written by Agnes Starret, the
editor and founder of the university
press. According to Jamison,
Starret published the first official
history of the university.

“There’s a difference. Much of the
university history had been pub-
lished in newspapers,” Jamison
said. “Mrs. Starret gave us a founda-
tion for most of our records.

Despite Starret’s work, however,
the archives has very little informa-
tion about Pitt during the 19th cen-
tury. Two fires wiped out most of
the records, assuring the archives of
“just a smattering of the chancellor’s
files,
1890’s,” said Jamison.

Many‘ of the older files are now
available on microfilm.

“It saves a lot of space. We’re just-

in the process now of filing scrap-
books from 1912 to 1920. In those:
days, everything that was written
about Pitt was clipped. If a student
got engaged, they clipped it. That

stuff isn’t going to be of historical‘

interest in 1990,” Jamison adds.
“They (the scrapbooks) were so
bad the paper would crumble in our
hands,” said Jamison.
Since Agnes Starret’s history of
the university appeared in 1937, no

official history of the university ha _

been written.

Robert Alberts, author of many
historical works, including “The
Shaping of the Point,”.a history of
Pittsburgh, has been commissioned
to write another history of the uni-

versity for Pitt’s 200th anniversary in

1987. '

‘‘In writing the history of the uni-
versity he's gone through just about
everything in the archives,” said
Jamison. i

Another area of the archives is
the Personal File, consisting of “a
biography of faculty, distinguished
alumni and administrators, anything
we could find about famous
peoples—Dr. Jonas Salk, for
instance-—of a biographical nature,”
according to Jamison.

One person on whom the
archives has quite a bit of biographi-
cal material is Samuel Langley,
director of Allegheny Observatory
and professor of astronomy at _the
university in 1867.

“We have a lot of prints of his
experiments with aerodynamics,”
said Jamison. 1

Many of the Allegheny Observa-
tory files are located in the Archives
of Industrial Society, because
according to Jamison, the AIS origi-
nally handled the Observatory and
the switch was never made.

Until two years ago the Archives it

Service Center was under the spe-
cial collections department, located

on“the same floor at Hillman library.
The special collections depart-

ment is the rare books and manus-
cripts, the Curtis Theater
collection,” Jamison said. “The
Archives Service Center got so big
we separated. Administratively,
we’re separate now."

Most requests at the Archives
Service Center concern various uni-

starting from about the.

versity publications.

“We get a lot of requests for
course descriptions. We try to get
every publication that’s put out by
the university. We don’t always get
them. The departments. are sup-
pposed to be aware of us, but not all
are.” Jamison said. '

A list of all the publications col- »

lected by the archives is available on
the third floor. Periodicals put out
by every department in the univer-
sity have-been indexed there.

“Sometimes a department will put,
out a publication which is edited by a
faculty member, and when the
member leaves, the publication is
discontinued, or publications are
rotated to another university,” Jam-
ison said.

Also collected by the University
Archives are monographs and ser-
ies put out by theuniversity press.

“Monographs are single volume ‘

works published all at the same

‘ time. Periodicals are done periodi-

‘cally, and series come out over a
period of time,” said Jamison.

A good example of a series,
according to Jamison, is the Pitt

' Poetry Series, published by the uni-

versity ptess. “Each book has a dif-
ferent title and it comes out at a
different time. But the publication is
extended over a seriesof years."

Other areas of interest within the
University Archives include a
museum cabinet and a collection of
Audiotapes.

“We don’t like to collect museum
pieces because were not a
museum,” said Jamison.

The cabinet contains a paper-
weight from Chancellor Fitzgerald
and a medal of merit from the Uni-
versity of Brazil, as well as the old
driving clock of Allegheny
Observatory. -

“The rest is slides, and pretty big
audio tape collection,” Jamison
said. ,

The tape collection includes
speeches from honors convoca-
tions and commencement ceremo-
nies made here at the university,
said Jamison.

Also included in the University
Archives is a collection of- Pitt foot-
ball films, as well as a photographic
file of university buildings.

“We have a lot of records on the
Cathedral of Learning. They're used
quitealot. lt’s very interesting in that
they left the first four floors unfin-
ished, starting the stone wall as the
fifth,” said Jamison.

The reason for skipping the first
four floors was to be assured
enough money to complete the
building.

“lt was the Depression then, and
they didn’t know if they’d ever get
the money to finish it,” she said.

A complete record of the con?

struction of the Cathedral is in the
photographic files of the archives, as
well as the many designs ‘for the
Commons Room and plans for the
failed Panther Hollow Project, a
joint research venture between Pitt
and Carnegie-Mellon University.

According to Jamison, the
Panther Hollow Project failed
because of a lack of funds.

The University Archives averages
between forty and fifty students a
month, according to Jamison.

“The faculty and staff use it the

_ most, undergrads and graduate stu-

dentsare about equal. We havea lot
of visitors too—people from other
schools and university alumni.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May 26, 1982:

. City Photographer’s Collection

One way to get a unique historical
perspective of Pittsburgh is through
the city photographer’s collection,
one of the special collections con-
tained in the°Archives of Industrial
Society.

According to Frank Kurtik, pro-
ject archivist for the collection,
‘there are approximately 100,000

glass plates and negatives of the.
 city, dating from 1905 to 1958. Many

 of these images are rare and most of‘

them cannot be found elsewhere.
“The collection was a documen-
tary record kept by the city govern-
ment,” explained Kurtik. ‘‘It was all
done by the city photographer, who
answered directly to the Director of
Public Works, but did work for
other departments such as parks,
city council and public safety.”
The collection was acquired by
the university in 1971. At that time,
“there was a reorganization of city
government under Peter Flaherty,
then mayor. There were separate
photography labs which were com-
bined to one office,” Kurtik said.
“When the mayor wanted the
office where the photographs were,

mm everything had to be moved.”

The photographs might have
been thrown away, had it not been
for chief photographer Joe
Mueller, who Kurtik believes is the
star of the story. Mueller decided.
that “the collection, was too valua-.-
ble to be destroyed; because the city;
has changed so much, it’s impor-i
tant to have a record," said Kurtik.

Mueller’ contacted ‘Frank
Zabrosky, coordinator of the

Archives Service Center, and,

trucks were sent to pick up the col-
lection. However, the photographs,
said Kurtik, “sat in storage in the
library annex on Atwood Street
until funding was received in
December, 1981.”

 collection is now housed in

 .

llman Library.

Kurtik’s job is to organize the
glass plates and negatives, which he
said have been “kind of out of order
since they were under pressure to
relocate.

“They were meticulous about
record—keeping, though. All of this

Pennsylvania Hall is pictured in this early 20th

information is printed on the nega-

tive, including who the photograph U

was taken for, what it’s of, the date it
was taken, and a catalogue
number.”

Many of the older city documents
were also photographed “as a
means of recording them,” Kurtik
added.

He is presently cataloguing the
negatives by hand so people can use
them. He hopes to obtain a compu-
terized system one day.

Kurtik explained why glass plates
were used instead of the negatives
seen today. “Cellulose nitrate film
was just beginning to be used and
there were problems with it.

‘‘In a way, glass is better because
it lasts longer and is more chemically
stable,” he added. _

He also said that “quality was lost
in going from larger negatives to the
35 millimeter size. The slower film
that was previously used showed
better detail.” Thus, the negatives in
the collection record the Pittsburgh
of the past remarkably will.

“Collections like this one in
other cities are heavily
used.”

of the past remarkably well.

Many of the negatives were
stored in old envelopes, which
according to Kurtik, can be harmful.

In order to better preserve them,

acid-free envelopes and boxes are
used.

In addition to the photographs,
the collection includes maps, plans
and drawings.

Few prints are included in the col-
lection, but they can be requested
by referring to the negative number
in the catalogue at the information
desk on the ground floor of Hillman.

“Collections like this one in other
cities are heavily used,” Kurtik said.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has
already made use of the collection,
and it is hoped that after peopleare
made aware of its existence, it will
be used more frequently.

Rieck’s Pure Ice Cream wagon makes a stop at Forbes and Atwood circa 1910.

The single biggest and most
important -archive in the labor
archives at the University of Pitts-
burgh is the United Electrical
Workers (U. E.) Archives, accord-
ing to archivist Mark McColloch.

' “We’re the repository of all their
(United Electrical Workers Unions’)
national records. We’re also in the
process of getting all their district
records,” said McColloch.

The archives began in 1975 when
McColloch and the University
Archives Service Center acquired
the electrical workers’ union
records from the U.E.’s headquar-
ters in New York City.

Since then, the labor archives
have picked up three of the six elec-
trical union districts in the United
States, according to McColloch.

“Frank Zabrosky and I developed
the grant. It was the next logical step
(after acquiring the national
records), and I suppose the next
step after this would be the locals,”
said McColloch. 5

McColloch joined the labor
archives in 1975, after graduating

from the university with a doctorate-

in labor history. In addition to being
an archivist, he also teaches labor
history in the university’s history
department.

“The U.E. had a unique history. It
was one of CIO unions and it had
progressive records, especially in
women’s rights’ questions and
minority rights,” according to
McColloch.

McColloch also believes the U.E.
is important from a civil liberation
point of view, “because the union
was a target of McCarthyism in the
’50s and a number of landmark
cases were centered around the
U.E.”

Probably the most famous case,
according to" McColloch is the
Quinn-Emspak case. 5

“Essentially what this revolved

around was peop|e’s right to take
the fifth amendment,” McColloch

said.

United Electrical
Archives Workers

Graduate students are the prim-
ary users of the collection, accord-
ing to McColloch. '

“Typically they come to use it for
a thesis or dissertation. The second
most common is undergraduates.
The archives are useful for the
undergraduate doing research on
term papers. They come from his-
tory, and sociology, economics,
women’s studies, and Black stu-
dies,” he said.

“It’s really one of the best

labor archives in the

country——I’d say itwas in

the top ten.”

According to McColloch, people
come from all over to use the
archives.

“It’s really one of the best labor
archives in the country——l’d say it
was in the top ten,” said McColloch.

Aside from the U.E. collection,
the labor archives host a number of
other collections as well. The only
national collection is the U.E.,
however.

“We have a number of local union
records—service employees,
teamsters. Most are locals or indi-
viduals associated with the tri-state
area,” said McColloch.

One of the most famous individu-
als in the collection, according to
McColloch, is Monsignor Charles
Owen Rice.

“He was sort of known in this area
as the labor priest. He’s played a big
role in labor activities since the
19305.” said McColloch.

Today, according to McColloch,
the archive is in the midst or an
aggressive collecting policy.

“We basically want to ‘continue
along two lines— one is the expand
the U.E. collection to include the
districts, then the locals.

The second is to get more

- records of local union.”

While McColloch said the U.E.
was the only national collection the
archives intends to get in the next
five years, he’s still “interested in
any union locals from western Pen-
nsylvania or the tri-state areas——any
official records of the locals, the
labor relations records or labor
attorneys, or people who worked as

mediators.”

,While McColloch believes it’s rel-
atively easy to document the fam-
ous people in society, it’s more
difficult tochronicle the history of
working people.

“If working people are going to be
studied, the single most important
institution working people have
created are unions,” according to
McColloch.

The archive is needed to preserve
the papers of the unions, according
to McColloch.

“Mostly because of financial prob-
lems, few unions can develop or pre-
serve their own records. Most
‘unions are overstretched extremely

in terms of staff or money. Their
papers get lost if there's no preser-
vation planned,” he said. Therefore,
according to McColloch, archives
.are absolutely vital.

“It’s a real insight into some of the
experiences of working people,
even though it doesn't give the
whole picture.”

Pittsburgh and the western Pesn-
nsylvania area is, according to
Mc Colloch, “one of the two or three
richest areas in this country in terms
of labor history.

‘‘It’s been the center of mass pro-
duction in mass production indus-
tries. It's been the center of unions.”

In Europe, they used barbed-

Tan violence. Someday soon Amer-

ica may have to explore this
measure.

Some may laugh at the notion.
However, when beer -bottles are
thrown on the baseball diamond at
speeds that would rival that of a
Nolan Ryan fastball, most will
agree that the unhealthy relation-
ship between players and their
“fans” is no laughing matter.

With the astronomical salaries
and the growing number of prima-
donnas, the fan has become less
patient when a player fails to meet
to his expectations. The player,

realizing this fact, is on the defen-
sive, performing for the paycheck
rather than the uniform and what
it represents. _ .

Thus, there is an inevitable al-
ienation. Hometown stars are
transformed into vivacious ene-
mies who spit in the hand that
feeds -them. Supporting crowds
turn into obscenity shouting, bat-
tery hurling antagonists, and the-
battle» lines are drawn between the
playing field and the_grandstands.

One incident which clearly dem-
onstrates this growing alienation
of player and fan took place this
past baseball season. In an after-
noon in the hot St. Louis sun,
Garry Templeton shattered his
pressure gauge, and made obscene‘
gestures to the crowd.

St. Louis manager Whitey Her-
zog referred to Templeton’s action
as the most disgraceful thing he
ever saw in baseball. Templeton
labeled it, “a cry for help.” Regard-
less of how it’s perceived, it was
definitely an illustration of hatred
on both sides.

Templeton’s actions were not
directed toward the entire ballpark,
only to a few rude patrons above
the St. Louis dugout. This group
of spectators shouted racial slurs,
and nailed the shortstop with ice
cubes.

“I actually didn't do it to the
whole stadium—it’s hard to justify

yourself when they said you
flipped—off all of ‘St. Louis,”
explained Templeton. Unfortu-

nately, his emotions
expressed in a manner easily
misinterpreted.

In this incident, as in others,
both sides were to blame. Fans
don’t have the right to consider the
team or the players as any type of
personal investment. The fans
should mind their own business,
and in this case, their business was
to watch the game and leave the
personal comments and criticisms
out.

The short-tempered shortstop
was also at fault. _ Templeton’s
$600,000 a year contract is for play-
ing the game of baseball, not the
game of revenge.

In addition, Templeton could

have improved his image without
arrogantly stating, “if I ain’t start-
ing, I ain't departing,” while refus-
ing to participate in the 1979
All-Star Game.

What finally evolved out of this
controversial incident is that Tem-
pleton got a new life with the San
Diego -Padres.‘ He also got slapped

with a yet unpaid $5,000 fine, -

which is presently being contested
by the Players Association. And as
for the rude group of antagonists,
well, they’ll just have to look else-
where for a Cardinal scapegoat this
year.

Having good player-fan rela-

tionships is a two-way street. In,

this case, both sides were going the
wrong way.

Champions come and go. By
games end, it is not the success of a
particular play we remember but
its failure. Instead of lavishing the
hero, we languish over the goat.

When we reminisce, we don't
caress the winner's accomplish-
ments, but rather- we beseige the

, losers with “What if?"

0 What if John Brown had
tripped between the fifteen and ten

‘yard line while the ball was still in

the air? Obviously, Pitt provided
one of the most exciting plays in
Sugar Bowl history, sending the
Pitt fans and players into a frenzy
with only 35 seconds remaining in
the game. But as Georgia fans pro-
tested, just what if?

0 What if Boom-Boom Mancini
had not gotten off the canvas after
Arturo Frias floored him in their
lightweight championship fight?
If that had been the case, maybe
nobody would have even heard of
Youngstown, Ohio. It would have
remained a purgatory between
Pittsburgh and Cleveland. And
there would be one particular

father in this world whose dream

would have died not once, nor
twice, but three times.

0 What if Stan “The Man” Mus-
ial had accepted his basketball
scholarship to Pitt? Musial is con-

‘ sidered the greatest hitter of all-

time. Without him, the St. Louis
Cardinals would have been just an
average baseball team.

0 What if the Penguins had

‘ scored the first goal during over-

time of their fifth and deciding
playoff game against the New York
Islanders? The Pens’ Mike Bullard
had an unscreened slapshot at
Islander goalie Billy Smith but was
unable to cash in on his good for-
tune’. Imagine if he had. Randy
Carlyle would have circled the

0 What if the NBA semi-final

rather than seven? Well, the Phila-
delphia 76’er fans would have been
spared considerable heartache. The
76’ers wouldn't be considered the
Minnesota Vikings of basketball.
And who would have heard of the
loyal Boston Celtic fans?

0 Whatif the Boston Celtics had
won the seventh game of this year's
semi-final round against the Phila-
delphia 76’ers? Pittsburgh just
might have had themselves an
NBA team and Philadelphia may
have lost one.

0 What if Fred “Wrong Team"
Brown hadn't thrown the ball to
James Worthy with only six
seconds left in the NCAA Cham-
pionship basketball game? Besides
having a different NCAA basket-
ball champ—namely the George-
town Hoyas—North Carolina
might have Worthy for another
year, instead of losing him to the
NBA. And Pitt would be enteringa
conference that could boast a
defending NCAA champ. As if Pitt
needed more headaches.

0 What if the UCLA Bruin bas-

- ketball team hadn’t been on proba-

tion last year? Fred “Wrong Team”
Brown might never have thrown
away an NCAA Championship.

0 What if Bill Mazeroski had
come to bat in the ninth inning of
the seventh game of the 1960 World
Series, the score tied at 9, and struck
out? The New York Yankees would
have won 22 World Series to ‘the
Pirates’ three. And Frankie Gus-
tine would have a different pic-
ture in its doorway.

0 What if Pitt’s football season
had been three quarters shorter?
Then Pitt would have won back-
to-back NCAA titles. About 3,000
more Pitt fans would have been at
the Sugar Bowl. And Penn State
wouldn’t have had the last laugh.

7“ The saying goes: “When it rains
it pours." That being the case, the
Panther track team was washed-
out by sturdy competition during
the IC4A’s championships held at
Princeton last weekend, as none of
the Panthers qualified for the
upcoming NCAA title meet. Prior
to the IC4A’s, Coach Mike Agosti-
nella said that the Panthers would
need the right breaks to send repre-
sentatives to Provo, Utah—the site
of the NCAA finals. But all the
breaks went in the opposite
direction.

For example, Tim. Lewis, the
starting cornerback for the Panther
football team and a runner on the

,4_00-meter relay team, pulled a
diminishing
the Panthers‘ already slim chances
of winning the event. One strong
event for Pitt was the 800-meter
run, for which four Panthers had
qualified earlier this season. Yet,
only one—Terry Gallagher-
reached the semi-finals. _

“There were 100 schools at Prin-
ceton," he said. “This was the big-
gest conference meet for us this
year. “The competition was just
top—level. We had four guys in the
800-meter run, but so did Rich-
mond and teams like Penn State,
and Virginia had a couple."

Agostinella supplied the proof.
Mike (Iook who won the 800-meter
at the Pitt Invitational earlier this

iseason. was blown away at the
l(l*lA's.

Freshman Roger Kingdom was
the only Panther to place, taking
third in the I10-meter hurdles with
a time of 141.17. Despite having
failed to qualify anyone for nation-
als. ;\gnostinella was pleased with
his team's perfornrance. saying, “I
think we ran well."

.\lthough the season ended on a
somewhat somhet note. Agosti-
nella expressed satisfaction with
both the indoor and outdoor track
seasons.

“We really did some great things
.his year." he said. “We had an
indoor ;\lI—.-\merita in Darren
Geary, set an American record in
the two mile relay—-even though
we finished sixth-—and set several
school records. .

“We had a good year."

     
        
      
      
     
    
      
     
       
      
       
     
     
       
   
   
    
     
 
      
       
     
   
 
  
 
  

   
  
   

Women (AIAW) Division II Track
and Field Championship held at
Austin Peay University.

Henderson's time of 12:3 was a
half second slower than the Pitt
record that she set in the F.AlWA
regionals. Henderson also set a
new Pitt. and F.AlAW record in the
200-meter run with a time of 24.0 in
the same regional. In the ten meets
that the Lady Panthers ran before
Nationals, the Peabody graduate
finished in the top three spots in
every race and won. seven of the
events.

Light it up...

After announcing that the
opener against North Carolina
would be played on September 9 at
Three Rivers Stadium, Pitt's senior
vice chancellor for administration,
Dr. Jack Freeman, also said that the
university would install perman-
ent lights at Pitt Stadium in time
for the 1983 football season.

Noting that lights couldn’t be
installed in time for this year's
opener, Freeman said that the
lights would add flexibility to the
NCAA dual network television
plan and would increase attend-
ance, as well as intramural and
recreational use.

Temporary lighting for the
North Carolina game was ruled
out because the glare would be
bothersome to the spectators.

Preliminary designs for the
lighting have already been drawn
up although Pitt officials are try-
ing to improve them.

MARSHALL CRENSI-IA
Heaven V ‘-
May 20, 1982

— CHUCK BERRY

. Stanley Theatre

May 21, 1982

«This feeling, it feels so good!

—Call_,it,hope, relief_or_iIlusions of

grandeur, but while everyone’
scramblesto find the appropriate
epitaph for rock ’n roll, allow me
this small" celebration. It wasn't,
just one incredible night‘ of music

that has left me reeling—-it was

two... _

Marshall Crenshaw appeared at
Heaven last Thursday, the first
date on his first tour. One day later,
Chuck Berry headlined the Roots
of Rock ’N Roll show at the Stanley

’marking his severity or eighty
~ thousandth such show of the past,
' no one really knows how many

years. A bit of immaturity followed

  

by a breath of immortality: a transi-
tion of a sort that left me whisper-
ing those committing vows, “only
rock ’nT_ roll, but I like it.”
Crenshaw took to the stage at
’Heaven, relaxed, unassuming, cut-
ting an Elvis Costello-like figure,
but possessing none of that des-
pot’s unpleasantries. If the pres-
sures of the first tour, the debut
album, and a mess of critical
acclaim to own up to existed, they
were kept ‘a secret from the
audience. ' A
Like his music, Crenshaw’s per-
formance gave you no sense of atti-

' tude, but rather possessed a good

time feel that could come only from
‘a genuinely nice guy. Heaven's
New Wave regulars, accustomed to
arrogance and abuse, were initially
lukewarm in their response.

With the exception of one _cover,
Cliff Richard’s “Movin’,” Cren-
shaw stuck to the albumzs material;
The three member band managed

A 'riie.'i3§’ui i<iéws.’*i?v¢dd'e§a2i’y;“’10aa¥y‘ z I, is 

   

 

sufficient texture to their sound.
The arrangements remained true
to the album and were dominated
by Crenshaw’s well-honed vocals.
Highlights of the plateau show
were “Mary Anne,” a street corner
serenade with a Latino beat, arid
the revved-up “She Can’t Dance”L
that claims, “but she's ‘got to be
parttof that pop, pop, pop, pop
music thing." Let's hope that Mar-
shall Crenshaw's clean, fresh
sound becomes a large part of that
“pop music thing."  _
One performer who needn't wait
for any redefining is Chuck Berry.
As they say, he wrote the book.
While most of Friday’s Roots of
Rock ’N Roll s‘how continually
reminded you that it was indeed a
revival, Chuck Berry came outlike
a rocker who has never stopped and
who certainly needs no reviving.’
Sure, he looks worn and maybe his

"voice doesn’t command a full

range, but this has always been
true. -
Berry opened with “Roll Over

E Beethoven,” easing intoihis show

like a lion tamer into thevcage.
“School Days” was next and Berry
gradually let loose the fire in his
fingerti'ps. Berry, more than any

guitarist past or present, creates the
illusion that fingers and frets are
one and the same.

In addition to being a great
musician, Berry hasn't ceased
being a showman, always poised to
make the audience a part of the
songs. This was especially true
during the finale of “johnny B.
Goode" and “Reelin' and
Rockin’," as the stage was engulfed
with all of Chuck's kids, some of
them‘ well into middle-age, but

dancing about nevertheless. As Bob

Seger said, “rock 'n" roll
forgets.” - —
If nothing else, the performances

IICVCI‘

of Marshall Crenshaw and Chuck‘

Berry have added ten or twenty

years to the sentence of this life-

long prisoner of rock ‘n’ roll!

QUARTERFLASH/THRILLS
Stanley Theatre ‘
May 15, 1982,

Expectations going into this
concert were low. After all, Quar-
terflash stillheld opening band sta-
tus in my mind, and Thrills (a local
newcomer) had been added in place
of Prism (a nationally known act).
A boring evening seemed

inevitable. » .
I couldn't have been more

wrong. ~
Thrills had a stimulating set that

lasted‘ almost an hour. They

whipped the crown into a nea .

frenzy after two songs and k_,..._
them there throughout the perfor-
mance. _ _ _ i _
After intermission, it was time to
really rock. Quarterflaslt came on
stage. Many consider this sextet a
cheap Pat Benatar copy. but this IS
not so. Rindy Ross,'the female
vocalist, is an integral part of the
band—not a pretty puppet who

sings well. Ross plays sax and_

shares vocals with one of her male
cohorts. «

The crowd took to Quarterflash
instantly, and the band ate it up.
Most of the material was from the
debut album, but some new tu Q
were played. “Harden My Heart”
and “Find Another Fool” were, of
course, the biggest crowd-pleasers.

Instead ofboring and inade-

quate,_the night was alive and ful-
filling; These two bands are for real
and- Quarterflash is a true

_ headliner.

V extremities:

' DRY DREAMS

The Jim Carroll Band

I Atco Records

‘ There must be a great amount of
confusion in the minds of many
young people who experimented
with drugs" in the _early sixties,
because jim Carroll tested heroin

when he was only twelve, thinking '

that marijuana was the addictive
drug. By the age of 16, he had a
serious habit and a copyright on
his first book, “The Basketball
Diaries," which records his usual
adolescent adventures with a
haunting innocence. .

It was a book about a war baby
who was committed to opening his
eyes to what was around him and
finding a means to express it, but
by the end he had become a victim
of his dream and his surroundings.

Now, his blood is “pure” and
rock ’n’ roll seems the perfect way to
reveal his experiences to more peo-
ple (if they care to see them).
Anyone who has read William Bur-
roughs, or has paid any attention

to Lou Reed, or has even seen pic-"

_tures-* of ' Keith Richards should
have somenotion of where Carroll
is coming from.

Using the label “poetry” in the
same sentenceas “rock ‘ii’ roll” has
been a great source of controversy,
but Carroll, who has studied under
Allen Ginsberg, seems one of the
more deserving of the ‘honor. His
songs travel into the New York
drug underworld, where what he
sees is translated into almost sur-
realistic, but sensuous and graphic
images. Images 'of the decadence
around him (from which he is not
exempt) and of the deception of the
establishment that parachutes men
into “Barricades” (traps like
Vietnam).

‘ “Dry Dreams” lacks the raw edge
of “Catholic Boy,” but the arrange-
ments are more textural and
imaginative, without losing the
spontaneity of Carroll’s enchant-
ing vocals. His songs are still scat-
tered with religious icons -(bells,
Crucifixes, angels,'cathedrals, etc.),
his fascination with the Catholic
sacraments and salvation (“I’m
cursed to be a singer/A singer of the
flame/A thinker of a fir\e,and a son
without a name”), and the animal
grace of women (“...that's when I
_told you that the cheetah walked as
fine as you”). V

Carroll’s world is one where lives
are dangerously balanced between
terror and beauty,
death and wonder, salvation and
damnation. Jim Carroll seems like
‘pure gold in an industry of bronze
pretentions.

BIG. SCIENCE
Laurie Anderson
Warner Brothers

I waited until I saw Laurie And-
erson display her full spectrum of
color at- Carnegie Music Hall
this review, and I feel

.2

 

obliged to start by saying that this
album can only offer the barest
glimpse into the range and scope of
her work.

The concert was astounding. She
used everything in her bag of tricks
to delight and captivate an
audience who gave her a standing
ovation: technical virtuosity (on
violin‘, ‘synthesizer and voice), an
incredible variety of sophisticated
gadgetry (tapes, slides, .filnis), a
saxophonist, her body, a
supremely gifted imagination, a
sarcastic yet subtle wit, a smooth,
confident professionalism and on,

i and on, and...Well, if you were

there, you know what I mean.
She is of a rare breed--the
“serious” artists who achieve
recognition in the pop world after
years of work at more “serious”
pursuits. Yet Laurie Anderson

I defies labels.

‘Her album is drawn from her
eight-hour concert opus, “United
States,” and presents _a veritable
conucopia of styles and influences.

She has collected, assimilated
and composed a sumptous pot-

pourri of contemporary life, draw-
ing on‘ everything from
avant-garde works of art, provin-
cial dialects and popular songs to
the everyday expressions we take‘

for granted and don’t really notice.

Many of the works revolve
around texts that serve as a basis,
but have been embellished, deco-‘
.1"? ted and built upon. They convey
messages that are often thought
provoking and always, interesting.

‘These are beautiful and graceful
works of art presented with finesse ‘

and aplomb by a true artist. Bravo,
Laurie Anderson!

If you are at all interested in
either “serious” music or experi-
mental “pop,” or anything in
between, with incisive humor
mixed in, this record is a must. -

P.S. Ifyou ever get a chance to see
her live, don’t miss itl!

NOET: Add wit and angst to taste

YIELDS: l album’s worth love

songs

From the songbook of Marshall
Crenshaw comes a batch of blue-
ribbon songs that,.when pressed
onto vinyl, chronicle a genre—-
'American pop-—with a deftness
heretofore unattainable by original
material. « '
A well mixed rehash of over-
heard hits this is not! Instead,
Crenshaw has provided a beauti-
fully crafted debut album of his
own words and music seemingly
driven by a vision that is singularly
Crenshaw’s, yet “all-American” in
every sense of the word. It’s asif
he's taken the appeal of the
motherland’s_ revivalist twins,

    

 

Edmunds and Lowe, and set it in a
boy meets girl, apple pie and lemo-
nade scenario.

Side one’s best include “There
She Goes Again,” “Girls,” and
“Someday, Someway,” the latter
being one of five Crenshaw tunes
recorded by rockabilly rave Robert
Gordon.

Side two gets even better with
“She Can’t Dance" and “Cynical
Girl," the former being the nearest

. we get to a rocker, the lattera ‘wry.

love song custom made for the

eighties boasting a Spector-like
production of fuzzy ‘reverbs and
clanging-bell percussion.
“Marshall Crenshaw” uses ele-
ments of the sparse, econo-sound
made good by both the Go-Go’s

- and The Waitresses, rarely stretch-

ingithe three-piece band. Such sim-
plicity can be attackedby some as
quickly as it is applauded by oth'_-
ers. Is it naive to believe that things
can sound the same as they did in
the good ol’ days of rock ’n roll?
Maybe, but thanks to the likes of
Marshall Crenshaw, they don't

t have to sound the same to bejust as
,good!

TIME AND TIDE
Split Enz
A&M '

Lather. Rinse, Repeat. The Split

,,Enz have been reading too many

shampoo bottles lately. just when
a song starts to become interesting,
the repetition washes away any-
thing good. The spotless produc-
tion makes a few of the tunes sound
like Genesis, and “Haul Away"
resemble a l6th century madrigal.

New progressive rock is the gen-
eral description of their seventh
album. There are plenty of melo-
dies and harmonies with a wide
variety of sounds and moods, but
too much repetition kills most of
the tuties. a

“Dirty Creature,” with its piano
tinklings, and “Hello Sandy
Allen" have - potential to crack
playlists on commercial radio, but
are not likely to reach the Top 40.

“Six Months in a Leaky Boat” is
a good ELO imitation with hi—tech
acoustic guitar and synths.

Lead vocalist Tim~Finn has done
elevator music for Australian films
and it shows up throughout this
LP._ _ _ .

The entire disc is likable but
there’s nothing that will stick to
the ribs, making the album forget-
table in a week. Even after several
listenings, nothing is hummable,
just a rumbling, hypnotizing
drone.

Producer Hugh Padgham, who
has worked with Genesis, XT C and
the Police, hides the weak vocals on
some of the better songs like “Take
a Walk,” “Giant Heartbeat”. and
“Lost for Words.” The strange lyr-
ics and strained tenor vocals are
obnoxious. 4

Overall, these compositions are

.as appetizing as cold mashed

potatoes-‘predictable mediocre
mush. Can anyone write songs
anymore?

the title song of “Cat People” _.

(“Putting out Fire”).

On the other hand, if you enjoy
the type of filler that links seg-

you’ll probably enjoy the rest of_
the “Cat People” soundtrack, wri V
-ten and produced by
iMoroder(in cooperat-ion with

Giorgio

As with most soundtracks, it
helps to have seen the-mgovie in
order to appreciate titles such as
“Leopard Tree Dream,” “Night
Rabbit,” and my favorite, “Bring
the Prod." Unfortunately, even
recalling the movie's striking
images fails to raise Moroder’s pro-
grammedmelodies above the level
of background music.

However, if you've decided that
you really need a soundtrack
album, get,.a copy of “Christiane
F.” With the exception of a some-
what weak live version of “Station

to Station,” this is a decent coll-ec- T
tion of some of Bowie's later-

releases, including “Heroes,”
“Look Back in Anger,” “Boys Keep
Swinging,” “Stay” and “TVC-15.”
Just the thing to complement that

battered copy of “Ziggy Stardust”

you never play.
