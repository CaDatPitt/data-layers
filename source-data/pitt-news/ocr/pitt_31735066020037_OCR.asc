When the dry rush policy was im-
plemented for this fall, controversy
was expected. That controversy arose
during th_e first event of the term.

”There has been a report of some
alleged violations around dry rush,”
said Joyce Giangarlo, acting director
of student activities. '

According to Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity member Bruce Monsour,
the alleged violation occurred at a
tailgate party held in the parking lot
of the Syria Mosque prior to the Pitt-
Maryland game on Monday.

Monsour said members of Phi
Gamma Delta were attending a

faci I ity

The 29 sororities and fraternities at

Pitt have.recently selected Harmar-

ville Rehabilitation Center as the reci-
pient of their fund—raising project for
I986-87. Pitt Greeks annually select
a local nonprofit organization for
their fund-raising efforts which begin
in the fall and culminate in March
with "Greek Week.”

Activities planned for this year's
fund-raising project include hoagie

sales, chariot races, donations col-'

lected from canning, 'a dahce
marathon, can recycling, talent
shows and a food-eating contest.
These activities will help raise the
money for this year's goal, which has
been set at $62,000.

Already working closely for the
Greeks’ fundraising are Pitt seniors
Ken Kumer and Linda Wolf, general
chairmen, and Jeff Martchek,
business manager. The staff of the
Harmarville Foundation is also work-
ing with these Pitt seniors so that the
efforts are coordinated on both ends.

_”We’re really enthusiastic about
this project,” Kumer said. ”Because
Harmarville is well- known and has
such a good reputation, we're confi-
dent we can exceed our goal.”

All money raised by the Greeks
will go toward helping Harmarville
develop a new fitness/wellness pro-
gram known as Healthsports. This
program will offer conditioning, train-
ing and recreational activities for
severely disabled persons.

tailgate party held by a graduate
brother of the fraternity.

”We all went up to the tailgate par-
ty wearing FIJI [Phi Gamma Delta]
stuff, because we had held a
watermelon picnic before that,” he
said. ”There was a huge crowd of

. people. We were rushing these guys

[freshmen]. They were coming over
and talking to us because we were all
wearing our FIJI stuff.”

According to Monsour, Luke
Kluchko,- a graduate assistant in the
student activities office approached
the group and requested identifica-
tion from persons he believed were
freshmen.

According to Greek Adviser
Bridget Guernsey, Kluchko was hired

to help implement the dry rush policy
and to monitor the rush system. Later
in the school year he will assist

' Guernsey in other administrative

duties.

”What we were doing was not
wrong at all,” said Monsour. ”It
wasn't a rush event; one of our
graduate brothers bought a couple of
barrels [of beer] for us. As it turned
out, there were a lot of freshmen
around." '

According to the policies govern-
ing fraternity rush, which are
enforced by the office of student ac-
tivities:

sidered rush events unless exempt by
the Office of Student Activities.

In addition, fraternities must sub-
mit any activities they want exempt
from rush regulations to the office of
Student Activities two weeks prior to
the planned event. No rushees are
permitted to attend these events.

Finally, no alcohol in any form may
be present at any activity or event at
which a rushee is present. Fraternities
are prohibited from purchasing or
providing alcohol to any rushee
through any means at any time dur-
ing rush.

Guernsey, who must request a
hearing in the case of alleged viola-

 

tions said a hearing will beheld to-
day to decide if there will be any
sanctions applied to the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity.

”We haven't collected any
evidence, and I'm being very open-
minded,” said Guernsey. ’’We don't
decide on any type of sanction until

we determine if a person is guilty or-

not guilty.”

”There were fraternity members I

there, and there were freshmen there
too," Monusour said. ”So, I guess
we're getting implicated on that.”

Giangarlo said the Student Ac- ~ 

tivities Office is currently in-
vestigating possible violations by

other fraternities but no hearings have ' I 

been scheduled.

’Fear’ motivated

contract approval

By Chris Capra
Staff Writer

University maintenance workers
considered striking for higher pay,
but last Friday approved a contract for

fear they would lose their jobs, ac- ..
' cordingto workers interviewed by

The Pitt News.

Members of Local 29 of the
Building Services Union ratified a
contract by a 200-56 margin which
gave each worker a signing bonus of
$150 as well as a 30 cent hourly in-
crease over the next 2‘/2 years.

Those same workers rejected the
same offer only two nights before.

Tony Mannella, a university
maintenance worker, said the univer-
sity employed scare tactics.

”They used scare tactics as far as
saying they would replace us with
outside workers’ if we struck. And
they used this especially against the
maids. ‘You're gonna be replaced,’
they said.” '

Another worker believed a strike
wouldn't have helped because the
university wouldn't have responded.
’’I feel like this: even if we didn't get

what we want, it's better than hitting

the street. I don't think a strike would
do any good because they would
have just let us stay out there,” said

Plans to discontinue programs at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh at Titusville have been drop-
ped in favor of revitalization of the educational
opportunities and facilities at that campus. Pro-
grams to improve recruitment efforts, academic
counseling and the physical facilities have
already begun. .

University President Wesley Posvar
explained that the goal of the effort is to ”re-
tain and strengthen the University of Pittsburgh
at Titusville campus as an integral part of the
University of Pittsburgh and to make available
the highest possible level of academic oppor-

tunities for high school graduates from the

Titusville area and from throughout Penn.-
sylvania.”
In order to determine his or her specific

academic needs, each student will undergo an
academic attainment analysis upon enrollment.
The analysis includes a series of diagnostic tests
designed to measure past academic achieve-
ment as well as potential. Instructors will
develop strategies for each student based on
test results and place students in appropriate
learning levels within the curriculum.

”The idea is to givelthe instruction to each
student according to his or her own abilities,”
said Titusville Executive Dean Samuel Johnson.

’’They’ll be going through personal com-

prehensive assessment to determine each stu-
dent's individual needs.”

In addition to the academic attainment
analysis, programs for tutorial service and
computer-assisted instruction are being
developed. If the analysis determines that a stu-
dent needs additional work in any academic

area, opportunities to take non-credit courses ,

or -to engage in specialized learning will be

”We want to develop a program at Titusville
that is unusually responsive and adaptive to
each student's particular needs,” Posvar said.
”It differs from most other such programs in
that it is student—oriented rather than institution-
oriented. The program is focused on fitting the
curriculum to student needs and particualar
academic requirements rather than making the
student fit into a fixed curriculum system.”

The new program is suited to the Titusville
campus because of its size and location, Posvar
said. The campus serves approximately 160
full-time and 100 part-time students.

”Our goal is to achieve an enrollment of 500
in four or five years,” Johnson said. ”We’re
working very closely with the Oakland admis-
sions office, and we're starting a system of stu-
dent assistance, which is students passing along
information. We also plan to use our alumni

extensively.” , ~

vide the Titusville campus with the resources 
neccesary to implement it, the university has -’

outlined a long-term plan. According to Posvar,
Pitt will allocate up to $500,000 to modernize
campus facilities, revise recruiting procedures
to increase enrollment and seek additional
financial support from state and federal
agencies. '

”We’re very excited to have the general
direction determined and to have a strong com-
mitment from the university and from the presi-
dent,” Johnson said.

The revitalized Titusville campus is expected
to serve as a sophisticated model demonstra-

tion program for emulation elsewhere, accord- _

ing to Posvar. ”I believe this program and.our
overall commitment to Titusville will make a
significant contribution to educational pro-

WASHINGTON — The State
Department announced Thursday
that the United States is willing to
trade accused Soviet spy Gennady
Zakharov for Nicholas Daniloff, a
U5. News and World Report cor-
respondant who the Soviets say is a

' spy. Daniloff, who has worked in

Moscow for nearly five years, was ar-
rested Saturday night by KGB agents
after meeting with an acquaintance
who handed him a sealed envelope.
The Soviets said documents marked
top secret and photos of military in-
stallations were inside the package.
Daniloff said he was framed_ and that
he thought he was accepting old
newspaper clippings. State Depart-
ment sources said the arrest was in

~ retaliation for the American detention

of Zakharov, a physicist at the United
Nations in New York who was
allegedly caught trying to sell under-
cover agents military secrets.

College GOP expects growth

By Jack Burkman ’
Staff Writer

     

There is a growing political
awareness on college campuses to-
day, according to Roan Canfer, presi-
dent of the University of Pittsburgh's
chapter of College Republicans.
Canfer’s group, in its second year, has
amassed more than 300 members.
Many were added just this week. .

”The Activities Fair really helped
us,” Canfer said. ”Seventy—five new
freshmen signed up.”

Canfer said he believes the new-
found support for his group is main-
ly attributable to a nation-wide
resurgence of conservativism among
America's young people. He also
said that he believed today's col-
legiates, largely because of President
Reagan, have considerably more
pride in their nation.

”There is a lot of patriotism going
around today,"Canfer stated.

Republican office seekers figure to
receive considerable assistance from
the College Republicans this year.

 Li bya’S Kh ad afy

This past summer, Americans stayed home for vacation. We were
warned that worldwide terrorism could strike anywhere at any time.
lt seems that there were little or no major terrorism strikes this sum-
mer. That may be a result of Americans not travelling, or it may be
.,a ‘result of our stance on Col. Moammar Khadafy.

Our president, Ronald Reagan, once called Libyan leader Moam-
mar Khadafy a madman. That was after an outbreak of world-wide
terrorism which Khadafy sponsored. Reagan answered Khadafy’s
threats and airport attacks with a mid-April bombing on the Libyan
coast. Khadafy and his followers suffered a painful blow. He vowed
that he and his supporters would retaliate, but the U.S. bombing seem-
edto put terrorism on hold.

» Then, the verbal wars_started. Khadafy threatened more attacks.
Reagan hinted that he wouldn't wait for these new attacks to strike
Libya again. Khadafy gained support from Syria's President Hafez
Assad, who is also a reported terrorism participant. Reagan dispatched

g a naval fleet to engage in war games in close proximity to the Libyan
shores. -Then the Soviet Union displayed support for the Libyan leader
by sending a high-ranking Russian contingent to the ceremonies mark-
ing the 17th anniversary of Khadafy’s takeover.

This is a bomb getting ready to explode. Neither side thinks that
it is doing anything wrong. Reagan claims that the war games weren't
held close to Libya in order to launch a new attack. In fact, the of-
ficial policy is to uphold sanctions against Libya and to squeeze Libya
economically while reserving the right to respond to specific acts of
terrorism that can be traced to states or groups. Khadafy claims that

. he and his people will strike because they have been dealt a blow
by the United States that cannot go unanswered.

While we all sit and watch, more people may die and this whole

' mess could blow up into a third world war. Why is the United States
stirring up a hive of angry bees? There are other places we can con-
duct war games. Why have them near Libya? It is a fact that Libya
must be watched -— closely. However, it can be monitored without

’ being provoked. There is no reason to continue to threaten our foes
as they threaten us. After all, didn't we get involved to stop the killing?

Proposition 48
is a needed rule

Proposition 48 has cost many college athletic teams prime

freshmen recruits. The NCAA has finally cracked down on schools

, permitting athletes with less-than—adequate academic qualifications
to engage in sports.

This was a bold move by the NCAA, but a move that was
nonetheless needed. Too many ”students” were being graded, not
on their work in the classroom, but on their performance on the

. athletic field. ~ ’

. Pitt has suffered from this NCAA ruling. The new academic stan-
‘ dards are what stand between almost all of the Pitt basketball recruits
' and playing time. But Pitt isn't the only school hard hit. That so many

College isn't for everyone

At an estimated worth exceeding
$300 million, Ralph Lauren has
become the kind of folk hero he
depicts in his fashions. Lauren is the
kind of person who read The Great
Gatsby and decided to pursue that
life which he so much revered. How
did he do this? Was it an elaborate
design education? Was it at least a
college education? It was neither of
these. It was an education made of
dreams —— dreams of a young man
growing up in the Bronx.

In a world where young people are
constantly being told that the only
way to the good life is a formal
education, Ralph Lauren took a short-
cut to reach this goal. He studied
those things in which he was in-
terested. He didn't force-feed himself
with facts on subjects that would
eventuaUy lead to a degree. No, he
knew where his talents lay, and he
developed and refined them.

- It didn't happen all at once. The
design world isn't one that lends ac-
ceptance to newcomers. But, with
persistence and early supporters,
Lauren made his mark on the design
world. He was the one who intro-
duced four-inch-wid_e ties. Then? he

followed with wide collars on shirts
and wide lapels on sports jackets. It
was a fashion risk, but it paid off.
Most of you who read this probably
have some Ralph Lauren clothes. The
college crowd is a big market for his
line of clothing. His clothes are ex-
pensive, but they have that cute lit-
tle polo pony on them. Everyone
who wears Polo/Ralph Lauren cloth-

ing is participating in the fantasy that
the designer has created — that the
good life exists.

Ralph Lauren never went to col-
lege. He will make more in his
lifetime than most of Pitt's graduating
class combined. But that's not impor-
tant. They say that it's all the same
after the first million anyway. What
is important is that he saw what he
wanted to do and did it.» He didn't
struggle for a blind degree in a field
in which he had no interest.

We should all question the purpose
of higher education. Are we here to
polish an interest or just to pass time?
I didn't know the answer to that ques-
tion until after my junior year, so
don't worry if you don't know the
answer yet. You pmay, however,
know that you won't reach your goals
by means of a college education. If
that is so, go out and do what you
must to reach your own dream. Ralph
Lauren did ‘— look what happened to
him. He had a dream and made it
work; Let the upraised polo mallet in-
the hands of that tiny polo player

, represent a dream of success, the way

Ralph intended. But, make it your
own dream.

and unhappiness from all quarters are
few but are of the most decisive con-
sequence. Allow these to be named.

Academic requirements for athletes
is a hot topic. Sports provide much
bread and butter for overpaid facul-
ty, staff and administrators who find
it more difficult these days to extract
dollars from a heavily indebted stu-
dent population. Incidentally, this

The presence of military personnel
on campus is yet another hot topic.
Samuel Adams, American founding
father, wrote that a large standing
army would imperil the very liberties
of a country it pretended to protect. -
Americans are immobilized by super-
ficiality, andthe military cannot be
trusted. it is a profoundly devious
organization. The notorious presence
of SE! (a defense-related super-facility)
at CMU, a university with which Pitt
cooperates on its own supercom-

on which to comment. The U.S.S.R.
has motives which greatly exceed its
wit and abilities. Our idiotic imitation
of their monomaniacal statecraft has
imperiled our productivity. We build
useless, useless, useless armaments
while our debts mount and our trade
balance disintegrates. Meanwhile,
just as students are distracted by
sports, so too is this university
distracted by McCarthyism.

The editorial department will con-
tinue to actively seek the answers to
these issues and pinpoint precisely
where the refusal to answer these
questions originates. The forum of
controversy is the only legitimate
avenue to reconcile our differences.
The pen of the journalist defending
the free will never cower from that
task. '

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September 5, I986 .

Wash that man right out of your hair 

Q. He's 50 and I'm 40 — we get
on like a house afi re. However, when
he gets really aroused he goes off to
a prostitute instead of applying to me.
He said that way he avoids en-
tanglements. What’s wrong with en-
tanglements? Anyway, his system
works — he has stayed untangled for
years and years. Can I tangle him up
a little? I'd really like to.

A. No! That's no with an exclamation
point. I'm not shouting, just very
definite and swift. No, you go out and
buy the record ”Wash That Man
Right Out Of My Hair” andplay it
until you have it all down pat
because that will help you get the
idea and the good feeling that goes
with it. Then send him on his way.

There is my answer. My question:
How come you let that situation go
on? How could you waste your time
and emotion like that? Why should
you give him the foreplay and then
let him take his arousal to a pro?
What about your own arousal? Be-
sides, in today's plague of sexually
transmitted diseases, you should not
let him_ getintimate with you when
he has been in contact with pro-
miscuous people.

Sometimes it sounds glib when I
say ’’Tell him goodbye” or ’’Tell her
goodbye!” I know, it isn't just that
people tell me it sounds so, I often
think it myself as I say it. This is worth
saying something about. It isn't easy
to kick somebody out just because
you realize you should. It's even less
easy just because someone is telling
you that you should.

To be told he's hurting you, he's
putting you down, damaging you, is
to hear stuff from someone who
doesn't grasp how much emotion
you have invested, how dumping
that person and all those feelings is
like ending life. But it happens in life
that certain relationships are best left
behind, mourned and allowed to
pass into one’s personal history.

Q. I went with this girl [for a while],
three months ago. We are in different
high schools. I really like her. Then
she stopped seeing me. When I met
her this week she was five months
pregnant. What should I do?

A. You mean, like join a service
club or try out for a team? Take a
night job? There is nothing for you
to do. The baby is not yours, that's
simple arithmetic. Five months minus
three months is you're not the papa.
If the part you want help with is that
you really like her, want to be her
friend, OK, be her friend —— but not
to the extent of saying it's your child.

Maybe you can help her wise up
and see a social worker. But if you
let yourself be sentimentally drawn
into this mess or get sexually in-
volved with her, you will soon need
to see one yourself.

Q. I am 16, and my left breast is
bigger than my right one. I am scared

I of cancer so I won't go to a doctor.

Am I the only person who has this?

A. I feel certain that somewhere in
the world is another I6-year-old with
a left breast larger than her right one.
There is nothing new under the sun
— that's in the Bible. But you must
not walk around with fear.

If you are afraid to see a doctor, tell
someone else about what is troubling
you — "your mother, sister or aunt,
someone who will go to the doctor
with you. The doctor may relieve
your mind of that fear with a simple
examination and a few welcome
words. _If you have some condition
needing treatment, it needs treatment
now.

Q. I found out my husband has
been seeing another woman for a
year. He tells me to go along with it
because he may lose interest in her.
How long should I .wait before I
lower the boom? I need your answer
in print so this birdbrain can see what
he sounds like.

_ A. Noproblem! lwant you to know I

that in my private practice I hear such
questions often. Should a blatant in-
fidelity be countenanced? Unless
there are compelling reasons that you
have not confided here, tell him no.
Tell him cut it out or you leave.

Are you supposed to wait around
indefinitely in case he gets tired of go-
ing to bed with her? If he agrees to
cut it out and you agree to stay with
him on those terms, make up your
mind to forgive him. After that, don't
bring his infidelity up every time you
have a fight.

Q. Where can I get the latest infor-
mation on sexually transmitted
diseases? I am sexually active with a
few men who have a lot of one-night
stands. I am too young to be tied
down to one guy, and marriage is a
long way off for me. I'm afraid of
catching something. Please answer
quickly.

A. Don't rush me! OK, no matter
how young you are you can catch a
wide variety of sexually transmitted
diseases through heterosexual pro-
miscuity. If you keep on with your
present attitude and behavior, you
will, sooner or later, need treatment
for at least one of them.

There is one thing you can do. You
can make sure that the man wears a
condom. This is a pretty good barrier

against certain infections — not all .

though. To find out more, go to a
clinic and have a thorough checkup,
take home whatever pamphlets are
on hand there and ask where you can
get the latest published information.

Q. Is it normal for people to get
enough out of a relationship without
having sex in it?

   
  
  

Presenting

A Classic Collection of Jewelry for Fraternities and Sororities.

 

A. Many kinds of relationships are
fantastic without sex, including some
between men and some between
men and women where there is
warmth, love, touching, a measure of
physical need. Lack of sex in a rela-
tionship may, on the other hand,
cause dissatisfaction in one or both
of the partners, as the readers of this
column can observe.

And one or both of the partners
may worry about the lack of sex out
of fear that life is passing by and
nothing happening —— a possibility
that should be examined thoughtful-
ly. Normality is not the criterion for
judging this sort of relationship, but
how it really meets theneeds of the
peoplelinvolved.

Q. I want my girl to move in with
me but she won't because of her
parents. She is 20, I am older and just
divorced. Her parents let her see me,
but they would be oldfashioned
about her living together. But
wouldn't that be acceptable in to-
day's society?

A. Today's society or not, if she
won't, she has her reasons. Two be-
ing those parents. She is not ready to
give up being their live-at-home

When O'Neill Sanford took over as
the director of the Pitt marching band
14 months ago, he was intent on
making changes. Now, at the begin-
ning of his second year, some of
those changes are becoming evident.

The most obvious change is the
purchase of new band uniforms to
replace the old.

”The old uniforms were worn out,”
Sanford said. ”I felt a change was
needed in the color scheme; we
needed more color on the field. The
back of the uniform is dark blue so

\ that when the band is going away

from you it has the psychological ef-
fect of going away. We've livened up
the front of the uniform by adding the
white and gold so that when the band
is approaching you, it appears bright
and colorful." 4
Other changes have been made in
the way of instruments. Many new in-
struments have been bought to
replace worn instruments. In one
case, several new baritone horns
were purchased to replace the vin-
tage 1945 horns that had been used.
Only about 15 percent of the in-
struments have been replaced while
approximately 60 percent are the per-
sonal property of the student.
There are, however, several prob-
lems yet to be overcome. The band
is presently operating with far fewer
members than Sanford would prefer.
This summer's band camp only
produced 187 members, which is
about 100 shy of where Sanford
would like to operate. I
”We need a larger band,” Sanford
said. ”We have a lot of students here
at Pitt that are afraid to come out and
play in the band for one reason or
another. Many freshmen are afraid to
come and join because their high

Pitt Band seeking expansion

The band unveiled its uniforms at the Pitt-Maryland game.

school counselors or their parents
told them that they probably
wouldn't have enough time.”

To try to remedy this Sanford has
tried to show freshmen during the ad-
vising sessions that joining the band
does not take as much time as they
may have thought. The band, Sanford
said, only practices about eight to 10
hours a week divided into two—hour
sessions on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturday
mornings. He has also tried to con-
tact_ incoming freshman who have
played in high school bands by send-

ing them personal letters telling them ,

to check out the band.

In the effort to increase the band
size Sanford is offering a.specia| mini
band camp starting Wednesday, Sept.
10 at 6 p.m. at the stadium. Sanford
also hopes that the prospect of play-
ing in the half-time show in next sum-
mer’s‘ NFL exposition game in
London, England, will draw more
recruits to the band.

This year the band's only travel
plans are to Buffalo, N.Y., where they
will play at half-time during a Bills
game, as well as accompanying the
football team to Penn State and Notre
Dame.

In this age of health-consciousness,
many people try to stay away from
sugar and caffeine. Soft drink
manufacturers have been cashing in
on the health craze with products like
Diet Pepsi Free and Caffeine Free
Diet Coke. To a college student fac-
ing the prospect of an all-night study
session, however, ingesting anything
caffeine-free is unthinkable.

Students now have a new weapon
in their arsenal against sleep — Jolt
Cola. Boasting (“all the sugar and
twice the caffeine as regular soft
drinks,” the soft drink is produced by
a small company located in
Rochester, N.Y.

Jolt looks and tastes similar to the
two cola giants, Coke and Pepsi, but

there is one major difference: Ounce
per ounce, Jolt has approximately
twice the caffeine.

According to Jim Beauchamp, vice
president of The Jolt Company lnc.,
Jolt has a taste that's for everybody.
He said Jolt is especially appropriate
for people who can't handle the caf-
feine in coffee but still want more caf-

feine in their soft drink than Coke or

Pepsi.
”Some people want caffeine but
can't use the amount that's in coffee,”

. said Beauchamp. ”Jolt is for those

people.”

By the ounce, Jolt is 5.9 percent
caffeine, which is the maximum
amount of caffeine a soft drink may
contain as regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration. Coffee,
however, has approximately five
times the amount of caffeine Coke
and Pepsi have, according to

Jolt isn't very well known yet; most
Pitt students asked had never heard
of it. Of those that have, most learned
of it when David Letterman men-
tioned it during his popular late night
talk show. Most of those who had
heard of Jolt Cola expressed an in-
terest in trying it.

’’I might try it as a substitute for cof-
fee during finals. Anything has to
taste better than coffee,” said Pitt
sophomore George Graham.

Santiago Distributing Company,‘

the local distributor ofJo|t, claims that
sales in Pittsburgh have been good so
far.

”Of the stores we initially supplied
with Jolt, 70 percent have reor-
dered,” said sales director Ron
Valent. He went on to say that Jolt
Cola is available in the Pittsburgh
area in cans and two-literbottles.

ATS. The Cynics. The Sonic Youth.
These groups don't bring to mind an
overplayed song or a video on MTV.
They are bands that are played

a regularly on WPTS-FM at 98.5, Pitt's

student-run radio station. A lot of
students may not listen to it because
the music is not immediately
recognizable, like Pitt sophomore
Bruce Bobak.

‘'1 think they should play what's
popular so everyone will want to
listen,’’ said Pitt sophomore Bruce
Bobak. ”After all, WPTS is for the
students.”

Station manager Mark Daniels ad-
mits the music takes a while to get
used to.

”Some people listen to us for the
first time and think it's the most

bizarre thing they ever heard,” he
_said. ”But most people grow to like

it. Our audience likes change and the
chance to hear new music.”

The music WPTS plays is not only
new, it's progressive. Madonna
makes new albums, but there's very
little chance they will be played on
WPTS. Progressive music is artistic,
according to music director Patty
Pisula.

But does hard-core new music
sound artistic? Crashing drums and
blaring feedback from electric guitars
make some people change the sta-
tion. But Pisula said music doesn't
have to sound nice to be good.

"Music doesn't have to be
aesthetically pleasing to be worth
something. It can be emotional. Even
though it doesn't sound nice it can
still be a piece of art, just for the emo-
tions and energy involved," she said.

Pisula said the goal of WPTS is not
to be commercially successful, it is
to educate the Pitt listeners. It lets
them know there's more music than
what the commercial radio stations
play.

”Our goal is not to make money,
it's to enlighten the masses of Pitt,”
she said.

But why isn't pop music artistic? If
a Phil Collins song played on WHTX-
FM is catchy and has a good tune
then why isn't it good enough to be

played on WPTS?

”We won't play Phil Collins
because he became a musical whore
to make hits,” she said. ”But we will
play Peter Gabriel, an artist that also
came from Genesis. We played
”Sledgehammer” when it was a Top
10 hit. We still play U—2 and The
Clash. It doesn't matter if it's popular
— it just has to be good.”

That's a policy that differs from
WRCT-FM, Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity's student -radio station. WRCT

‘plays hard-core and experimental

music. _
’’I would call VVRCT avant-garde.
I think WPTS is a lot easier to listen
to, not because it's lighter music, but
because we stick to a consistent for-
mat. WRCT has 3-hour segments of
all different styles of music.
”WPTS is progressive. We're not
striving to be avant-garde. WRCT is
trying to appeal to a very small, but
tightly knit, group of people. We're

 

[’rogressive‘l:ormat is style1of WPTS1

after a different audience.

”That’s why we throw in songs
from Simple Minds and Bananarama.
It's the hook to pull listeners in from
the mainstream,” she said.

The progressive format does have
its limits, however. Some songs can
be artistic and creative, but they will
never be played on WPTS.

”We take lots of requests, but we
don't play absolutely everything
that's requested. We won't play
”Stairway to Heaven,” because it's
been so tremendously over-glorified.
We have to set limits, and it's my job
to figure out what they are,” she said.

However, Pisula put rock oldies in-
to the format over the summer. The
DJs play one song from the '60s or
'70s each hour.

’’I think it's important to make peo-
ple realize that there was music
before 1977, when The Ramones
started punk rock. The Sex Pistols got
all the popularity, but I think The
Ramones really started the
movement.

”But we want to educate our
listeners in the same way that we play
progressive music. A lot of younger

  He's

t Boring

Morsholl Clark/The Pitt News

Bill Boring spinning records in his hideout at WPTS.

  

By Dave ‘Zafris
News Editor

Bill Boring doesn't have spiked
hair and doesn't wear a sleeveless
Black Flag T-shirt. His ear isn't
even pierced. For a DJ, it might be
thought that he dresses conser-
vatively. Possibly even a tad
boring.

”Yes, that really is my name,”
he said, answering a question that
he's probably been asked about
10,000 times.

The WPTS afternoon DJ then
spun around and faced the
multitude of vinyl music on the
wall behind him, finally choosing
”Rock Me Jerry Lewis” by Bud
Latour and former B-94 DJ Mike
Elliott.

’’I like to play novelty songs; a
lot of people request them,” Bor-
ing said as he spun the parody of
Amadeus on the turntable.

”We’ve pretty much outplayed
this one though, but someone re-
quested it, so  ”

The song began and Boring
paused for a moment before turn-
ing on his microphone. A puzzled
facial expression suddenly
transformed into that of a glib
radio personality.

”You’re listening to the pro-
gressive.FM — 98.5 WPT$,"ghe
said right before the words of the
song began. .

”That’s the trick. You have to
know how much time there is

 

before the singing starts. We can-

time that, but you have to time

what you're going to say, too. But 
, that line wasn't very long at all.". fr

Boring said the worst feeling is .

to go blank when you're sup- J

posed to be talking.

’’Usually I practice what I'm go—» A

ing to say when I'm walking
around in the street. People do

look at me kind of strangely, but
I'm always thinking of things to 4

say on the air,” he said.

It was now time for Boring’s ,
show to end, and the next DJ,_‘;.~_~,
Debbie Augustine, walked into". V:

the room.

"Well, I'll be seeing you all,’

later; Debbie's up next, and she's ~

picking out records right now,.

right, Debbie?” " _’
”Oh yeah, right, Bill,"Debbie

replied, making sure the listeners

could hear.

’’I lie all the time,” she said as 1
she began to move into Bill's posi_- '
tion. "You always have to. let 0

them think you're in control.’'.
Bill thought for a moment.
before he signed off.

”See you tomorrow and:_
remember, you can't get this kind ~ ;

of radio in the Soviet Union.”f'

Editor's Note: Bill Boring has been :
promoted to program director for“ ._
WPTS. He will no longer be heard’ ' 7.
in his afternoon slot, but will con- . '

tinue to fill in for other D/s.

THE PITT NEWS

  

It is more likely than not that dur-
ing the past four days you have
directed epithets toward the long
lines in the campus bookstore, the
preponderance of closed courses
and, of course, Mark Brasco.

Brasco kicks field goals for the Pitt
football team. More accurately,
Brasco misses field goals for the Pitt
football team. Last Monday night
against Maryland, he missed three at-
tempts.

The Panthers lost by three points,
and Brasco became the scapegoat.
Not surprisingly, head coach Mike
Gottfried announced last night that

‘P freshman Jeff Van Home of Gheyney,

Wash., would replace Brasco as the
starting placekicker.
’’I really believe that Mark Brasco

is an outstanding kicker,” Gottfried
said last night on his weekly radio
show. ”I just believe the answer for
us right now is Jeff Van Horne. We're
not giving up on Mark Brasco,
though. We will give him every op-
portunity to win his job back.”

As if he would want it back. He has
been attacked from all sides, by
reporters and students and teammates
alike. He has been blamed for the
loss to Maryland and nearly
everything else contributing to the
decline of the football program. He
even has been given a nickname by
those who fill Pitt Stadium.

It is ”B0O."

He hears it every time he walks on-
to the field. It does wonders for his
confidence. There can be no feeling

comparable to that of718,12(_) people
deriding you before you attempt a

field goal.

Brasco missed all three tries, all in
the first half. Pitt could have led 9-0
at halftime. Instead the game was
scoreless.

But it was not Brasco’s fault — not
entirely. The blame should be placed
on the coaching staff as well.

Mark Brasco did not decide last
Monday morning that he would be
the starting place-kicker. Gottfried
and assistant head coach Chuck
Klausing decided for him. They could
have chosen Pat Viancourt, who
made a 43-yard field goal in the clos-
ing seconds of a 13-10 victory over
Syracuse in 1983. They could have
chosen Van Horne, who was regard-
ed among the five best place-kickers

Brasco missed his third attempt

that he would have stuck with Brasco

the game. _

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September 5, i986

Why does Pitt have an athletic program?

It is a pleasure for me to have the
opportunity to kick off The Pitt News’
weekly guest sports column and to
welcome both new and returning
students.

There are a wide variety of topics
and issues involving intercollegiate
athletics to which l would like to ad-
dress myself. Problems related to
drugs, academic performance, in-
tegrity, budgets, television and gate
attendance are matters not only of
media attention but also of long-
standing and serious concerns to the
academic and athletic communities.
If The Pitt News will afford me or
members of our staff the opportuni-
ty, we will speak to those issues at.
a later time.

Today, let me confine myself to
something more basic and, in my
view, of fundamental importance to

our university community. From time
to time it is necessary to ask ourselves

' a question: Why do we have inter-

collegiate athletic programs at this
university? in other words, what is its
purpose?

Some critics would assert that the
purpose is to make money for the
university and in the process destroy,
if necessary, the more fundamental
values of the university. I can assure
you that if the purpose were financial
gain, we would be better advised to
invest our time and resources
elsewhere.’We do try as an athletics
department to produce sufficient
revenue to insure that our programs
are not a drain on university
resources. We also try diligently to
recruit young men and women who
have a reasonable chance to graduate
from this university and to provide

One day, while the Bears were out
relaxing and taking it easy after a

a newly inspired group of tough guys
sat down and decided to invade the
Bears’ turf. They worked and planned
all summer, doing everything possi-

on the opening day of Bear’ season,
they moved in. g_

By this time, the Bears were on the

It was then that they could hear the
unfamiliar ruckus that was going on

Panthers still can win,

but can they practice?

You may disagree, but I think:

0 It is too early to say how the re-
cent academic casualties will affect
the Pitt basketball team. if the Pan-
thers can remain injury-free
throughout the season they can
definitely achieve all of their goals,
even with a nine-player team.
Remember, Georgia Tech has been
a very successful team the last two
seasons with only an eight- or nine-
man roster.

0 People need to put Pitt's loss to
Maryland in perspective. First of all,
Maryland is a well-coached football
team. They have won the ACC cham-
pionship the past three seasons.

Secondly, the majority of Pitt
players don't know how to win at the
major-college level. As Tony Woods
mentioned to me this past summer,
the only players who have exper-
ienced winning at Pitt are the seniors
and fourth-year_juniors who played
on the Panthers 1983 Fiesta Bowl
squad. The younger players need to
get a good taste in their mouths for
winning. Consecutive victories over
N.C. State and Purdue would help.
Looking at those two school's person-
nel, it is a distinct possibility that Pitt
will win both games.

Last, but not least, everyone needs
to remember that it was Gottfried’s
first game. No one’s expecting
miracles. I'm confident that he will
turn the program around. How long
will it take? I don't know, but don't .

ENRIGHT

be surprised if he does it by the end
of this season.

0 It will be interesting to see what
the Pirates do with Tony Pena at the
end of the season. Pena, who
becomes a free agent at the conclu-
sion of the year, has raised his
average to a respectable .274. The
question is: Why pay a player more
money to hit 20 or 25 points below
his career average? Pena is a great
defensive catcher, but his offensive
play has deteriorated the last two
seasons. His average isn't horren-
dous, but his 45 RBl’s are. Don't be
surprised if he is in an Atlanta Braves
uniform next season with his favorite
manager, Chuck Tanner.

0 I happened to be in Boston last

 

week, and I caught a_Red Sox game
at Fenway Park. It's hard to believe
their fans, who are just waiting for the
American League East leaders to fold.
I don't think it will happen. Look for
the Sox in the World Series against
New York.

0 Whatever happened to Pitt
basketball player George Allen?

0 Nobody is expecting anything
from the injury—ridden Steelers this
season. And that is why I'm picking
them to go 9-7 in the AFC Central.

0 Scary thought of‘the day: If Tico
Cooper and Steve Maslek go down
with injuries, Pitt's starting front line
could be composed of Demetreus
Gore or Jerome Lane at small for-

ward, Charles Smith at center and,

Rich Carrigan, yes, Rich Carrigan, at
power forward.

0 One more note on_Panther foot-
ball. Look for Charles Gladman to
have a much-improved game running
the ball against N.C.State. The
reasons for his poor rushing totals in
the Maryland game are twofold. First,
the Terrapins’ wide-tackle six defen-
sive alignment is tough to run against.
Secondly, Gottfried wasn't kidding
when he said the emphasis will be

‘on a wide-open passing attack.

But if Pitt is to be successful this
season, Gladman has to carry the ball

'20 to 25 -times a game. Pitt doesn't

have enough depth at receiver to pass
the ball 45 times a game, as they did
Monday night.

Eligibility of Lady Panther
has yet to be determined

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

There is no update in the academic
status of Lady Panther basketball
player Lori Johnson, who is supposed
to sit out this season with a medical
redshirt.

Johnson, from New Castle High
School, has not yet cleared the
academic standards of Proposition
48, the eligibility guidelines for
freshmen athletes. -

The guidelines require a 2.0 high
school grade point average in 11
academic subjects and a 700
mimimum score on the SAT (or a 15
on the ACT).

Johnson scored above the
minimum on the test, but there is a
discrepancy with a math course she
took in high school.

In Wednesday's edition of The Pitt

AFC

continued from page 13

Duper. The Dolphins are an aerial
assault force, capable of scoring from
anywhere. Some type of ground
game would give Miami the ultimate
offense. That difficult chore is hand-
ed to backs Tony Nathan, Ron
Davenport and the lightning—quick
Lorenzo Hampton. The return of
nose tackle Bob Baumhower, who
missed all of last season with a knee
injury, will aid the shaky defensive
line. Linebacker Hugh Green will ex-
perience his first full season as a
Dolphin, which should help him im-
prove over last season's hot-and-cold
performance. Rookie John Offerdahl
is expected to make an immediate
impact. The Western Michigan inside
linebacker will compete with much-
maligned vets Mark Brown, Jay
Brophy and Jackie Shipp. If Miami
happens to reach the Super Bowl, the
defense will be the key. 12-4

Last season, the New York Jets ex-

  

 

lKirk Bruce

News it was erroneously reported
that, iflohnson was declared ineligi-
ble, she would have to sit out next
year in addition to this season.
Apparently, that is not the case.
Because Johnson is sitting out this

ceeded all expectations by churning
out an 11-5 record and making the
playoffs as a wi|d—card entry. This
time around, many folks will be sur-
prised if New York doesn't win their
division or even the AFC. Joe
Walton's team is loaded with talented
players, namely quarterback Ken
O'Brien, wide receiver Al Toon, run-
ning. back Freeman McNeil and
defensive linemen Joe Klecko and
Mark Gastineau. Lance Mehl and
Kyle Clifton are top-notch
linebackers, excellent at stopping the
run. New York's problem lies within
its offensive line, which allowed a
staggering 62 sacks in '85, so they
took Iowa tackle Mike Haight in the
first round. Haight is expected to fill
the gap left when former Pro Bowl
tackle Marvin Powell was traded to
Tampa Bay. New Yorkers hope they
won't be letdown like they were by
the promising but disappointing 1983

season due to an injured knee, it
doesn't matter if she is declared in-
eligible. She would still be eligible for
competition in the 1987-88 season.

The only effect the eligibility rule
will have on Johnson is the number
of years she can play at Pitt. If she is
ruled eligible, then she will take a
medical redshirt and still have four
years of eligibility.

But if Johnson is victimized by
Proposition 48, she will be ineligible
in this, her freshman season, and
have three years eligibility remaining.

Whatever the decision is, head
coach Kirk Bruce isn't concerned.
"As long as Lori's here" at Pitt, that is
all that matters,” said Bruce.
”Freshmen have a hard enough time
adjusting to the academic and social
aspects of college life as it is.
Whether Lori has three or four years
eligibility doesn't really matter.”

 

squad; 11-5 .

Which NFL team possesses the
most overall talent? Surprise, it's the
New England Patriots. Making the
Patriot roster is about as tough a
chore as beating Andre Tippett in a
karate bout. Tippett, incidentally, is
a black belt in the martial art. Most
analysts predict the Pats to falter in
1986, particularly due to their off-
season woes, such as the post-Super
Bowl drug scandal. But they've yet
to give head coach Raymond ~Berry
a chance to prove himself as a leader.
Last season he took the Cinderella
Pats through a series of stiff
challengers right to the Super Bowl.
Their decimation at the hands of the-
Bears only shadowed his unexpected
accomplishments. Quarterback Tony
Eason, if he's any type of a winner,
will bounce back from his shell-
shocking in the championship and

when he is kicking astray. If Joe
Schmoe is pushed into the bus lane
and flattened by the 61C-
McKeesport, you don't blame Joe
Schmoe. You blame whoever pushed
him.

In this case, the blame should be
properly placed on Coaches Gottfried
and Klausing, who three times in-
structed Brasco to walk to the center
of the field and attempt a field goal.
They could have deployed Viancourt
or Van Horne. Instead they chose
Brasco. It was their decision, and they
had to stand behind it.

Brasco has taken his share of
criticism, some deserved but most
undeserved. The phone number
listed beside his name in the Lit-
chfield Towers lobby apparently has
been changed, but the person who
answered that number last evening
said he has received from four to five
calls nightly since the Maryland game
intended for Brasco. He said Brasco
lives elsewhere in Forbes Hall.

”They ask whether I'm going to
transfer and stuff like that,” said the
student, who would identify himself
only as a sophomore from the School
of Health Related Professions. ”They

say things like, ’C’mon, this is Mark
Brasco. This isn't the wrong number.’

II

Brasco is not to be exempted from
criticism. He did miss three field goal
attempts against Maryland. He has
missed 20 of 31 field goal attempts
during his career. Perhaps he does
not deserve to be the starting place-
kicker, but he certainly does not
deserve to be blamed for the loss
against Maryland.

It was Gottfried and Klausing who
deemed him the starting placekicker
against Maryland.

If anyone, blame them.

help to continue New England's suc-
cess. Come gut-checking time, the
Patriots will be battling right there
with the best of them. 10-6
Sport Magazine predicted the In-
dianapolis Colts to be the comer of
the year, and they have every reason
to believe so, now that the Colts have
quarterback. Gary
Hogeboom, who joined the Colts
from Dallas in the off-season, gives
Indianapolis a passing threat, the first
they've had since Bertjones took the
snaps. Expect the Colts to air it out
a lot this season, especially since
coach Rod Dowhower is a passing
game fanatic. George Wonsley and
Randy McMillan are dependable
backs, while wide receivers Matt
Bouza and Wayne Capers are sticky-
fingered and blessed with good
speed. Indianapolis’ defense is on the
rise, led by Duane Bickett and John-
nie Cooks at the linebacking posi-
tions. Top-round drafteelon Hand is
an awesome pass rusher, but unfor-
tunately he's their only quality defen-
sive lineman. The secondary is quick
and hard-hitting. Only time will tell
if the magazine is a false prophet.
6-l0 .
Buffalo Bills fans were prepared for
another bleak, count-the-wins-on-
one-hand season, but that was before
owner Ralph Wilson inked USFL
superhero Jim Kelly to a five-year,
$7.5 million pact. What they must
realize is, just as Rome, N.Y. wasn't
built in a day — Buffalo won't be
either. Kelly's passing targets, Jerry
Butler and a cast of no-names, had
better hold onto the football, because
the Bills don't have much else to win
games. Running back Greg Bell is
sometimes a threat, but rookie Ron-
nie Harmon will need to produce
and give the Bills a consistent ground
game. Buffalo's defense has much to
be desired, but they have a proven
instructor in head coach Hank
Bullough and could become rather
effective by year's end. 4-1_2
Fans. of the Cleveland Browns
won't be blue in 1986. Coach Marty
Schottenheimer will field a team that
is talented at every position, especial-
ly at QB where Bernie Kosar oper-
ates. The Browns would have beaten
the Miami Dolphins in last season's
playoffs (where they lost 24-21) had
they an effective passing game. So,
Schottenheimer hired Lindy lnfante,
an intelligent, innovative offensive
coordinator, to assist in the efforts.
With tough running backs like Kevin
Mack, Ernest Byner and Curtis
Dickey chewing up yardage, Cleve-
land's offense will be among the best
in the league. Defensively, the
Browns will again be punishing,
despite the death of All-Pro safety
Don Rogers over the summer. Strong
linebacking has always been Cleve-
land's forte, with Chip Banks, Clay
Matthews and Anthony Briggs turn-
ing in standout performances week-
ly. The Browns are back indeed. 10-6
The Cincinnati Bengals will have
something to say about who wins the
AFC Central this season. With
quarterback Boomer Esiason tossing
for big yardage to his fleet receivers,
the Bengals were near the top offen-
sively last season, and this year
should be no different. Defense is

where the Bengals need improve-
ment, so they chose LB Joe Kelly
(whohas yet to sign with the team
at this writing) as their first-round
pick. Linemen Ross Browner and Ed-
die Edwards need to supply a strong
pass rush if the Bengals are going to
improve on the 7-9 showing in 1985.
Boomer and Company will fire the
aces, but Cincinnati's defense will
have to break serve a little more
often. 9-7 _ _ _

The Houston Oilers’ glory days of
”Luv Ya Blue” are ever-so-slowly
disappearing from memory, basical-
ly due to their downright lousy teams
of the '80s. The Oilers have finished
last in the mediocre Central for
several consecutive years, but new
head coach Jerry Glanville is intent
on changing all of that. The former
defensive coordinator plans on open-
ing up the conservative Oiler scheme
by allowing former Nebraska super-
star Mike Rozier to carry the ball
more often. This simple adjustment
will take much performance pressure
away from" quarterback Warren
Moon. The supposedly dominating
offensive line was obviously consis-
tent last year —— consistenly allowing
on-charging opponents into the
backfield, where Moon would cringe
and bear it on every pass attempt.
Glanville should patch that area up
without much complication. The
Houston squad, especially the
defense, is youthful and talented. It's
now up to the coaches to produce a
winner. 6-10

Big changes are needed among the
ranks of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and
not only among the players. This
once-juggernaut of a football team
has been down, but that’s not the
greatest concern among Steeler fans.
The greatest worry is that this team
hasn't improved, or even showed
signs of improving during this
decade. Leading the Steelers is Mark
Malone, who happens to make a bet-
ter "scapegoat than a quarterback.
Rushers Walter Abercrombie and
Frank Pollard are adequate, but far
from being gamebreakers. Only
receivers Louis Lipps and John
Stallworth are Grade A ballplayers.
Pittsburgh's defense, aside from All-
Pro LB Mike Merriweather, is capable
of being outstanding and horrendous
on the same afternoon. Consistency
in that area is a definite must. The
Steelers still play fairly decent foot-
ball, but overall, the whole program
is stagnant and needs revision. A
coaching change is in order here.
6-10

Everyone’s favorite in the AFC this
season is the Denver Broncos,
coached by Dan Reeves. This scrap-
py, well-blended outfit is strong and

deep at every position. Fans in >

Denver are celebrating the second
coming of the famed ”Orange Crush
Defense,” which is under the direc-
tion of coordinator and master
strategist Joe Collier. With the addi-
tion of Mark Haynes, an aggressive,
sticky cornerback, to the defensive
unit, the Broncos can now afford to
play a challenging, ‘high-pressure
game, similar to that of the Bears. The
centerpiece of these defenders is Karl
Mecklenberg, a versatile linebacker

g with a passion for contact. As John

Elway goes, so does the Denver of-
fense.

The Los Angeles Raiders need a
quarterback, but that's about it. Con-
tenders for the position — Mark
Wilson, Jim Plunkett and Rusty Hilger
— all have obvious shortcomings. Yet
one had better evolve from the pack
or Los Angeles will have a rough time
making the playoffs in this ornery
division. H Navy star Napolean
McCa||um will join Marcus Allen in
the backfield this season after the
Navy hierarchy surprisingly permit-
ted his landmark sojourn. Look for
second-year receiver Jesse Hester to
burst into the limelight.

It has always been ”Bombs Away”
with the San Diego Chargers, but
these fellas just may have a for-
midable defense as a side dish this
time around. The mere thought of the
Chargers with 11 stoppers on‘the
field is absolutely horrifying to the
rest of the NFL, but with first-year
coordinator Ron Lynn pulling the
strings, it could become a reality. San
Diego has used draft after draft — no,
their futility in trying to stop oppos-
ing offenses hasn't driven the
coaching staff to drink —- attempting
to assemble a quality defense, and

they've acquired some astounding‘

talent along the way: Billy Ray Smith,
Ron Faurot and this year's top pick
Leslie—O'Neil,‘to name a few.

Simply, the Seattle Seahawks are
on the slide. At least they were
throughout last season. The new rap
on head coach Chuck Knox is that he
can take a Cinderella so far, but never
to the grand ball. Part of last season's
8-8 flop was due to the erratic per-
formance ofQB David Krieg, but his
job remains safe for this season after
no real threats were introduced at
camp. Top draftee John L. Williams,
a running back from Florida, is ex-
pected to ease Curt Warner's job,
playing both as a carrier and a
blocker. Wide receiver Daryl Turner
is fast with superb hands, while his
partner Steve Largent is a master of
deception, always getting open. The
Seahawks slipped last season in the
defensive department, but no major
breakdowns are expected this season.
Hopefully, for Chuck Knox’s sake,
Seattle hasn't gone their distance. 9-7

The Kansas City Chiefs are piled
high with fine players, yet get scalped
virtually every season. If coach John
Mackovic doesn't produce a winning
football team in 1986, owner Lamar
Hunt will fire him without reservation
(pun intended). Mackovic's first move
was to replace long-time starter Bill
Kenny at quarterback with Todd
Blackledge. Both are the same type
of player with equal abilities,
therefore a net gain of zero. What the
Chiefs need, to go along with their
wonderful secondary, is a prime-time
running back and a couple of brutal
linebackers. Rookie Dino Hackett
(LB) has Al|—Pro potential, and so far
he has pleased the K.C. coaching staff
with his reckless style of play. Fans
will know after the first few games
whether or not Mack will be back.
6-10

ference.

Momix rolls
Wllh the tide

By David Zuchowski

Momix, an unusual dance
troupe, is scheduled to open the
Dance Council's l98o-87
season this Friday and Saturday,
Sept. 5 and <5 at the Stephen
Foster Memorial Theater in
Oakland. Any one of their per-
formances can include music
ranging from compositions by
Vivaldi to those of King Sunny
Ade. The group makes use’of
everything from innovative
lighting to filmmakers, special ef-
fects, props, singers, DJs and
even a company sculptor. Ex-
ploring the unexpected in dance
and theater, the group has been

described as inspired vaude-.

villians whose creations vary
from slapstick and science fic-
tion to improvisational surprise.

Momix was founded by
Moses Pendleton and Alison
Chase; both were dancers with
another troupe called Pilobolus’.
Pendleton was one of the co-
founders of Pilobolus, named
after a fungus that thrives on
cow manure, but after perform-
ing a series of improvisatory
dances, used as warm—ups for
people attending the l98O
Winter Olympics in Lake Placid,
he decided to go it alone. Both
groups are noted for their unique
blend of gymnastics and modern
dance, and Momix has been
cited as a brilliant meld of
classical dance and acrobatics
in a perfect marriage of culture
and sports.

Pilobolus has left its mark on its
offspring Momix. Both are con-
cerned with the bizarre,
humorous possibilities of the
human body. But whereas
Pilobolus suggested building
blocks to the viewer (one body
topped by another), Momix sug-
gests water, with bodies un-
dulating and generating waves
of energy which are picked up
and returned by other bodies,
creating a beautiful effect. In
some pieces, Momix dancers
move as if they were at the mer-
cy of an invisible tide rolling and
pushing them about.

Like their neighbors, dancers
and ex—dancers of Pilobolus in
rural Connecticut, members of
Momix live communally and
create their own works in col-
laboration with one another.
Their efforts in this area result in
the ability to improvise on-stage.
As one member of the troupe,
Daniel Ezralow, puts it, ”The au-
dience sees the process as
we're doing it. tWe will
sometimes put pieces on stage
that are not quite finished. It's
not at the expense of the au-
dience because lthink it’s nice
for them to see the process [im-

provisation], to see someone’s _

mind working on stage."

After wondering about the
meaning of the word Momix, l
scurried to my Webster’s Dic-
tionary, but the closest I got to
an explanation was the pseudo-
homonym Momus, the name of
a mocking, Greek god who per-

l
I

I

sonified ridicule. Unsatisfied by
my efforts, I called the Dance
Council for a further explanation
and discovered that Momix is
the name for a milk supplement
fed to veal calves, a fact that
reiterated, in my mind at least,
Moses Pendleton’s assertion that
Momix is something that refuses
to be categorized.

Their Pittsburgh appearances
will include nine pieces, six of

which will be new to the local '

audience. Three of the works, in-
cluding the signature piece
/Viomix, have been seen here
before. The program will include

 While Island pictures hasn't

V unveiled an artistic treasure in

C/\/lona Lisa, it has released one
 r of the stronger commercial pic-
‘ -33. . tures of the year.

The scene is London's flesh

A trade. Like any other major
 metropolitan area, London has

its organized crime which holds

5..  girls captive through mental and
’ physical beatings and offers

their services for use in male fan-

'i  tasies. Mona Lisa alludes to a

sector of that trade which is as
violent as it is sexual. This
business is too much even for the
"respectable" underworld and

is certainly too much for

George.

George (Bob Hoskins) is a

i .,  small fish in the world of organiz-
~?-;.: * ed crime which, one assumes, is
 the way he likes it. Newly

released from prison, he begins

behind in her ascent out of the
sewer, and she persuades
George to find her. It is
something for which he is total-
ly unprepared.

As the film progresses he finds
only difficulty. His misconcep-
tions prove to be no match for
the decadence and sleaze he
uncovers. Although Simone tries
feebly to explain, in protecting
herself she is of little help to him.
His frustration continues to mount
along with what he perceives as
amorous feelings toward Simone
until the situation crumbles even
further.

George is an interesting vehi-
cle through whom you under-
stand the film and its subiect. The
audience, I assume, learns with
his mistakes and gets caught in
the same misconceptions. He is

our point of access into a world
that is hard to accept. If we
were thrown into such depravi-
ty without a point of reference,
like George, we might find it im-
possible to relate to in any
meaningful way. Fine perfor-
mances all around also help with
the film's believability and
realism. Michael Caine, who
plays the underworld boss, is
worth mention for turning in the
sleaziest performance of all.

The camera work was also
unusually creative and compe-

tent for a commercial film. In-

stead of the blunt, graphic
images often found in such
movies, the shots are subtler and
more eluding. The tension and
mood created by camera move-

ment in night-time scenes in Lon- '

don's red light district are
particularly stunning.

Unclear points in the script,
such as George's background
and his relationship with the

' underworld boss are the most

significant flaws in the film. I was
left somewhat confused at times
but not so that it interfered with
the main flow of action. Other
small problems were George's
heavy accent, which takes a
while to get used to, and a new
song by Genesis which was
unecessarily thrown in the mix.

No, Mona Lisa is not a master-
piece but it is a worthwhile ven-
ture in a time that is in desperate
need of good films.

Take-out Italian cuisine is an
unmistakably innovative concept
well suiting the ethnic environs of
the renovating, bohemian South
Side. In the midst of this dynamic
and aspiring community, fanciers
of Mediterranean recipes may
have the fortune to happen upon
Pasta Francesca at I922 East
Carson St. The establishment is
as new as the culinary secrets
employed there are ancient.
Although proprietress Francesca
still has some kinks to work out
in the areas of decor and
presentation, pasta lovers will
delight in a hearty and
wholesome homemade dining
experience which you can take
out and partake of on the banks
of the Monongahela River.

Francesca I\/Iartia Kenning,
owner, originator and gourmet,
happens to be a former instruc-
tor of Italian language and
literature at the University of

. Pittsburgh. She has accumulated

countless recipes and nuances of
regional italian specialities on
her numerous excursions to New
York and Italy, and she is

adamantly secretive about the _

specifics of her ingredients. This
affords her a unique and authen-
tic replication of Italian culinary
style, the likes of which I have
not encountered elsewhere in
Pittsburgh.

She sells seashells — and in
three different colors. Francesca
offers various and sundry all-
natural, homemade, dry and
frozen pastas including rotini,
fettuccini, manicotti, Iinguini,

paﬁa

gnocchi and cavatelli in the
flavors of egg, spinach, tomato,
basil and whole wheat. They
comprise her inimitable pasta

_salads and hot portions which

are completely created from
scratch. Selections sampled from
the cold bill of fare include a
pulpous and tangy tortellini with
pepperoni and diion dressing.
The texture of all pasta types
was characterized by an intrigu-
ing sericeous tenderness. The
combination pasta salad with
homemade mayonnaise, basil
and lemon was creamy and
acetic, as were the artichoke
hearts marinated in sour cream,
parmesan and assorted mint
leaves. Other combinations
graced with mint were the

tomato and cucumber with‘

herbs, a sparkling summer

 

solace, and the al dente green

bean salad in a mild, olive oil
base. ’
Among the hot preparations,

we were enticed with linguini ’

and three special house sauces.
Francesca uses a combination of
different cuts and consistencies
of tomatoes and several un-

LIFES RICH PAGEARNR

By Chris Zurawsky

When I bought lites Rich
Pageant, the guy behind the
counter at'~Jim’s Records in-
formed me that it was "the
album of the summer." l figured
that he was bustin’ my chops
‘and meant it tongue—in-cheek, as
in ”  another year, another
R.E.M. album.” Well, he
wasn't, it is, and what it really
is is different.

For starters it's the sound. |t's
a big sound — it sounds like
more but is really less (less guitar
playing, drumming and singing
and more production, for that
rock 'n’ roll anthem feel).

The band has definitely re-
solved and focusedmany of
their early introspective and ex-
perimental meanderings which
stopped l 984's Reckoning dead
in its tracks. There's a wealth of
consistently neck-snapping
musical car wrecks and pop
smash-ups on lites Rich Pageant‘;
from the album—opening feed-
backand guitar—scratching of
"Begin the Begin" to the
worked—over organ riffs .of
”These Days" and ”Super-
man" (a psychedelic '60s cover
featuring lead vocals by bassist
Mike Mills) these songs were
meant to be blasted across the
terrace on hot August nights.

Berry, Mills, Buck and Stipe
went to Belmont, |nd., for record
ing purposes and presumably to
partake of the steaming streams

UN “SUNG STORIES"
Phil Alvin
Slash Records

Read Showcase.

‘ Fridays in the
PITT NEWS.

 

By John Mccombe

The teenaged Phil Alvin was
apparently not solely a scholar
of the '50s and '60s R&B,
rockabilly and western swing
that shaped the sound of The
Blasters. it seems that his room

was also cluttered with some

scratchy old 785. He was
fascinated by the American
musical storytellers of the '20s,
'30s and '40s. Un "Sung
Stories" is a homage to the dir-
ty delta blues of the Mississippi
the hot iazz of LA. supper clubs
and to all of the space in
between.

Slash Records executives must
have passed out when Alvin
delivered the master tapes of his
first solo project. The Blasters
appeared to be on the verge of
a commercial breakthrough with
last year's Hard line. Now, the
company has to try and peddle
this new product. None of the

cuts are self-composed and

many of the songs’ publishing
rights have become public do-
main. In other words, this is
some pretty old stuff.

Alvin's connection to the era
that this record pays tribute to is
Blasters’ saxman l.ee Allen. in
the W505, Allen led a big band

which included three players

whose sons would later perform
with the famed Dirty Dozen
Brass Band. Alvin persuaded
Allen to acquire the services of
the Dirty Dozen, and, when they
agreed, the Alvin recording of
Bing Crosby's "Someone Stole
Gabriel's Horn" was complete.
Also appearing on four tracks is
legendary iazzman Sun Ra, who
has been known to fill jazz
ballrooms with some ultraslick
horn charts and arrangements.

Even though this album is
primarily a nostalgic remem-
brance, the echoes of the false
patriotism of the Reagan era
sound loud and clear. The WW|
era compositions "Titanic Blues"
‘and "Brother, Can You Spare a
Dime?" are a subtle reminder

that America must change her ,

present course or else strike on
iceberg and sink like the famed
Titanic.

Ultimately, one must question
whether Alvin's political analogy
will reach many ears. As a labor

Our $499 stereo system

does not sound like

an appliance!!!

   

/

Today, there are a lot of places
selling stereo sound including
department, appliance, mass mer-
chandising, and catalog stores.

Most of these stores have two
things in common. First, they do not
sell expensive state of the art com-
ponents so they rarely get to hear
the world's finest sounds. Second,
the nice people they employ, who
also sell refrigerators, lawn mowers,
and coffeee pots, are not the ones
from whom to get the correct ad-
vice about stereo. Their good inten-
tions are not a substitute for real
knowledge about sound.

Opus One Is the dealer for the
best sounding equipment in the
world. Our staff knows what is im-
portant for great sound and what is

not. We carefully test and listen to
all of the low cost equipment to find
the few that sound real, like the ex-
pensive great units.

Not only is Opus One, Penn-
sylvanio's oldest (founded in 1959]
stereo store, but our staff has work-
ed very hard to gain great know-
ledge about sound. Our people
have installed more stereo systems,
repaired more components. and
recorded more live concerts than
all other Pittsburgh audio stores put
together!

Our 8499 system has been
carefully engineered with a Sonus
Brown magnetic cartridge, a Dual
1258 automatic turntable, a Nikko
ND350 32 watt rms per channel im-
am receiver, and two Qenesis G7

loudspeakers. This remarkable system
will protect your valuable recordings
and sound much better than the
similarly priced chrome plated, “look-
a-like" components offered for sale by
appliance salesmen, in those one
brand rack systems, the systems price
is regularly S730.

Opus One has low cost, great
sounding options such as, CD players
cassette decks, stereophones, and
audio furniture to increase this
system's flexibility. Ask our experts for
their recommendations.

Helping to make our S4199 system

a legend in its own time, are many
knowledgeable Pittsburgh audio
philes who are recommending it to
their friends as the only low cost
system that really sounds good.

“where you leave a little bit smarter"

of love, Un "Sung Stories" suc-
ceeds admirably. As a statement
of purpose, the album is almost
certainly doomed to commercial
failure. The Blasters’ finest work
contained first person insights in-
to the plight of the working man.
At the same time, the sweet
sound of this garage band of-
fered easy escapism. Un "Sung
Stories" instead offers the plight
of "Minnie the Moocher" set to

the blast of the big band. The .

message is not that different from
that contained on Hard Line. But,
without the thrust of classic rock
'n' roll stylings, many ardent fans
will feel that these stories were
better left unsung.

BOOTLEG
Agression
Doug Moody Presents

By COLD-IRON

Aggression, despite the
swindling of their previous
agent, have managed to per-
sonally book their way into
another East Coast tour. Ag-

'gression's main goal is to clear
rumors of the band's .

up
mediocrity which are presently
circulating in the underground
network. Oxnard's first skate
quartet hasn't slowed down, nor
have they lost any of their early
swayfulness. The only dif-
ference, l believe, is an em-
phatic modification; a cleaner,
tighter sound.

Aggression's latest elated ple-

T bian release was recorded live

at CBGB's in New York. As with
all live LPs, this is somewhat of
a "greatest hits" collection,
though it still carries a few
unreleased songs, making it
somewhat appealing to fans of
the band's previous work. This
record also includes the debut
appearence of drummer John
Mitchell. Aggression's previous
drummer had to leave because

his father, Mickey Rooney,-

stated that his son's band would
never make it and that he would
take away the boy's Porsche
and his boat and his allowance
and his. 

Despite Aggression's rebel
appearance and gory logos, the
band lyrically carries a strong
and slightly conformist message.
For instance, "Slammin' At Tle
Club" gives a less popular ex-
planation of who is responsible
forfist throwing in L.A. clubs. The
bouncers see kids with
mohawk jumping off the stage,
starting fights, breaking things,
and are then supposed to "take
care of it." Bass player Big Bob
Clark elaborates, "| bounce a
few times when. we're not on
tour and the bouncers don't
mind the slammin' at all. It's
these Nazis with the idea that
destroying things make them
