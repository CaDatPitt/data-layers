Robert Raven Finds
A Purposelln Spain

ll And Returns A Hero

BY CLARE}'.CE VVIBLE

"Part of Robert Raven has re-
turned fromithe wars. He has
left his eyesight and the strength
of his right leg somewhere in
war-torn Spain. He is battered
But he says, “I
still have a few licks left. I would
go back and ﬁght again.” He is
.a hero. ~

Robert Raven once attended the
University of Pittsburgh. He had
his eyesight and the use of his
legs then, but life was dull and
aimless. He wanted something to
do.

There was awar going on in

Spain. Loyalist forces were ﬁght- A

ing the Fascist-Rebel forces of
General Franco, for the control of
Spain. So Robert Raven enlisted
in the Abraham Lincoln division
of the Loyalist Army. He de-
cided to make Spain safe for Com-
Jnunism.

Spain vs. Spain

He fought with guns, lived in
‘trenches, and saw Spain from be-
jhind the sights of a riﬂe. War
was an interesting and thrilling
game. It was something to do.
He was ﬁghting for a cause, Com-
munism and Spain against Fas-
cism and Spain.

But one day war caught up with
"Robert Raven. In one savage ex-
plosion of misdirected hate, war
hurled a grenade into his face.
He fell, torn, bleeding and hurt.
His eyes were gone and one leg
'wouldn’t work right. He crawled
back to the Loyalist lines. And
now he has returned home.

There was a picture of Robert
Raven in one of the local papers.
He was wearing black glasses to
hide the cavities that were once
eyes. There was a bandage around
his wounded leg. He walked with
a cane.

His brothers held him steady
while he posed for the picture.
People were grouped around him,
cheering him and clapping him
on the back. For he is a hero.
He is a Pittsburgher returned
from the wars.

War Game

In the picture, Raven was
smiling. He was making a brave
and chivalric front. He was dead
game. For you see, war is a game.
Robert Raven played at the game
of war and lost.

What does it matter that war
held ﬁve aces and demanded of
Robert Raven his eyes and his
leg? He was permitted, to live.
So Robert Raven smiles bravely
and the jackals and the sob sis-
ters cheer and feel brave and
noble.

I don’t feel brave and noble.
I don’t feel like cheering. I can
only remember that Robert Ra-
ven, not so long ago, was a stu-
dent of the University of Pitts-
burgh. And with the seriousness
and sincerity that I can muster, I
want to shout out to all the world,
“May God damn the game that
took away the eyes and strength
of Robert Raven!”

painter, Edgar Degas.‘ The pa-
per was written as part of a thesis
for her Master of Arts degree at
Smith College where for several
years she was assistant curator of

By MILTON G. LEHMAN
“The Stephen Foster Memorial was not built for :1 Univer-

sity dance hall.”

According to C. Stanton Belfour, in charge of the man-
agement of the Foster Memorial and director of the University ’s

Extension Division, the building

is the most pretentious memo-

rial to any composer ‘in the World.

In refusing permission to o

rganizations to hold dances in

the social room on the ground¢
tioor of the Memorial. Mr. Belfour '
indicated that the policy of man-
agement was to turn over the
building to affairs of quality——oi
a musical or dramatic nature.
MEMORIAL RULES

In accord with this policy, Mr.
Belfour outlined the following
Memorial:

1 The use of the building will
be restricted to University or-
ganizations, the Tuesday Musical
Club, and such meetings to which
the University is host.
The building, under the su-
pervision of Fletcher Hodges,
will be open to visitors, as indi-
viduals or in groups. I
9 Neither dances nor banquets
will be permitted in the Me-
morial.
CLARHPIES STAND

“Criticism,” Mr. Belfour said,
“has been connected chieﬂy with
the last regulation. In consider-
ation of the numerous requests for
the social room for dancing and
dining purposes, it will be well to
clarify our stand.”

In the first place, it would be
impossible to discriminate between
groups desiring the use of the
Memorial for dancing and ban-
quets, he stated. Determined not
to set a precedent in view of the
general purpose of the building,
campus organizations have been
refused permission to hold social
-affairs of this nature.

‘FOUR FORCES’

A further consideration, Mr.
Belfour pointed out, is the position
of the University in the manage-
ment of the Memorial. The build-
ing, he said, was the result of four
contributing forces.

The original idea for the con-
struction of the Memorial to the
Pittsburgh composer came from
the Tuesday Musical Club. The
Stephen C. Foster Memorial com-
mittee, composed of prominent

/

tor. Contribution of Josiah K.
Lilly of Indianapolis consisted of
his collection of Fosteriana, housed.
at present in the Memorial under
the supervision of Mr. Hodges.
Donations of the two groups and
Mr. Lilly helped to make the
building possible.
UNIVERSITYS POSITION
,'The position of the University

“The, position of the University
has. been to co-ordinate the plans,
complete the-iiconstrifiction and su-
pervise the *:rnanage'm’ent of the
Memorial,” said’ Mr. Belfour.

Among the University organi-
zations to use the Memorial and
campus affairs to be held there are
Pitt:Players, Glee Club, Women’s
Choral, Play Production class, YM-
YWCA (for worship -services),
University concerts, freshrriiﬁn as-
semblies, Women’s‘ Day,. and SFA
Concert Hours programs.

the two groups. ‘ ‘

One of the principal bones of
contention brought out duringthe

whether the CIO shall maintain
its identity as a separate organ-

Cop, Gown Authors Write New

1 Victory Song In

Swing Time

Swing has entered the ﬁeld of
ﬁght songs, as evidenced by the
new “Pitt Victory Song,” latest of
University melodies, which will
make its appearance in Glee Club
and Band programs in the .next
few weeks.

With music written by Dr. Ben-
iamin Levant, ’19, and lyrics by
Louis Fushan, ’21, and G. Nor-
man Reis, ’16, collaborators on
many Cap and Gown shows, the
tune is the most modern and up-
to-date of the college songs of
the country. Although it was
originally composed and played in
1932, its ﬁnal arrangement was
not completed until a short time
ago. --  -- "

The song is now being copy-
righted and will be printed by
the University. It will make its
ﬁrst appearance in the Intercolle-
giate Song Handbook, now being
prepared in New York.

‘With the distinction of being
the only song on which the Uni-
versity holds the copyright, the
song will take the place of “Hail
to Pitt” as the ﬁght song of the
University. Diﬁlculties with
copyright owners of .. the other
University songs have been the
chief cause of the omission of
these songs from frequent college
radio and movie , programs.

‘schools will join with Univer-
sity freshmen tomorrow in the

Debating Association.

Marking the second annual
local tourney on the national high
school question, ‘Resolved: That
the several states should adopt a
unicameral system of legislation,”
and will be conducted on a non-
decision basis.

from 12:15 o’clock until the be-
ginning of the third assembly at

at 1:30, the ﬁnal assembly, at
2:45, and the fourth debate wind-
ing up the series at 3 o’clock.

PLAN FOR DAY

William Stark, C38, debate man-
ager, has released the following
plan for the day. There will be
one debateon each side for each
school for each round. A compe-
tent critic will be furnished by
schools participating. No decisions
will be rendered. The purpose of
the tournament is to learn,’not to
win. Each school will enter as
many as four teams on each‘ side
and will be guaranteed one. debate
for each team.

“This tournament,” Stark de-
clared, “is ‘non-decision’, beiause
we feel that it ‘is more satisfac-
tory for high school debaters to
utilize this’ opportunity to -meet
other schools than merely to cor-
relate their iriformation, and pre-
pare for their regular schedule.

Williamscontinued, “There is al-
so the fact that placements dur-

By BILL COLKER

Brought back to Pittsburgh by popular demand, Nichols

Collegiate Shag, performed before jammed houses this Week.
According to an unofficial campus poll, shag is ra.pidly be-

Queen of Shag to see what they had to say about it.

Two debates have been planned
by the Women’s Debating Asso-

Both of these debates are on the

Nick was dressed in a sport coat
with enormous red and yellow

wide bow tie held his chin up,

Dixie was ’decked in a white,

“Shag,” as Nick enthusiastical-

of shine, sugar foot, truckin’,

it has to be exaggerated for ef-

THE PITT NEWS

The
Punter

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor

‘We were up at the Stadium
_Vesterda_\-' afternoon
around the locker room, when
we bumped into Biggie Gold-
berg, who just can't stay away
from the old hang;-out. Biggie
has enrolled as a student in
Mazeski’s 1nid—winter wi-estliiig
course, which has its advantages.
There’s the relative comfort of
landing on a soft mat after a
good, clean tackle.

Seeing Biggie around has only
one association

zthe year. That
is of a jammed

pable, w h i‘c 11
just about sums
up the Pitt sea-
son.

Now that the
boys have de-
cided in favor of

the fuller life, which is no more
than they justly deserve, it is ap-
propriate to take a skimp back
over the past few Saturday af-
ternoons and come to a few obvi-
ous conclusions.

THE TOP

First of all, it will be objective-
ly observed that we have what is
gently known as a damn good
football team. To be true to the
record, it should be reported that
the Panthers of 1937 were the ﬁn-
est football team in the nation.

This statement will hardly be
challenged. And we’re glad to get
it oil” our chest. We felt like say-
ing it last September, because we
had a sneaking suspicion of it
then.
things you only like to whisper
about in the early fall.

The fact that there were quite
a few of the boys who really know
that were sharing this assumption
is generally known. The Panthers
were the summer-book favorites,
and they came through.

It is something very close to an
unanimous opinion around the
states that the Panthers are tops.
Earlier in the week, the Associated
Press ratings placed them_ there,
decisively. Other methods of rank-
ing have done the same thing.

EVERYONE ASSENTS

Tuesday, the brothers Lambert,
were informed that their select
committee of 31 adjudged football
experts had picked Pitt as the best
team in the East. Joe Williams,
Grantland Rice, and Harry Gray-
son have expressed this as their
personal belief.

There isn’t much more to be
said about this selection of Pitt
as the best team of the year. We
might say that we agree, which is
nothing but a mild under-state-
ment.

It sems that Pitt had everything.
Offenses comes and offenses try to
go, but there was none to match
the Panthers. As a matter of rec-
ord there was none that could
come or go when it ran into the
Souchak to Daddio line.

THE REASON

And now we come to our second
conclusion. It really is our main
topic, although it has been shoved
under a rather necessary, but sub-
ordinate introduction. After spend-
ing ten weeks within better than
speaking range of the Pitt football
team we have discovered the
“why.” We know!’ the reason for
success of the Pitt football team.

It b all very simple. It is all
very apparent to those near the
team. It is Dr. Jock Sutherland.

Pitt football is what it is to-
day because of what it has in the
way of a coach. Dr. John B.
Sutherland is the greatest single
contributing factor in Pitt's grid-
iron success.

One of the most respected indi-
viduals in the University, the Pitt
coach, is more than just a. football
genius. He is a real man.

STRONG CHARACTER

This is just about the highest
tribute we can give to anyone.

A good many years back, the
good doctor was dubbed “Great
Stoneface” by one of the boys of
the working press. This, at the
time, was alleged to refer to
Sutherland’s reticence in speak-
ing for public consumption. If
such a condition did exist, it was
before our time. He is not at all
backward in his statement to the
press now.

We only bring this up because
we believe it is a really apt name
for Dr. Sutherland. It is appro-
priate in that it seems to reflect
the real Sutherland spirit, a spirit
of strength. It falls short only
because it fails to cover the
warmth mixed into that strong
spirit.

In the words of Captain John
Michelosen, giving the team slant,
“We’ve had a swell time playing
together under a coach we all ad-
mire and respect for his football
abilities, and, more important for
his inspirational ideals off and on
the field.”

event a success.

Eligibility is not limited. Fra-
ternities, and independents are
invited to participate.

Anyone not having won num-
erals or a varsity letter is eligi-
ble, providing he hands in the
entry blank with a ten-cent fee to
Jack Shricker, Harvey Rocker, or
at the boxing quarters located in
the Stadium.

FIST VVILL FLY

The first gloves will let loose
;at 4:30 o’clock Monday. Heavy
ldivisions will swing in action on
: Tuesday and the ﬁnals will follow
on Wednesday.

Varsity leather pushers, al-
though restricted from active par-
ticipation, will not remain idle.
They will aid in the general
handling of the ﬁghters and will
second for any ﬁghter desiring a
handler.

Here’s the opportunity to strut
your stuff. Winners will furnish
varsity timber. Besides, placing
or winning goes towards winning
numerals.

A sock on the nose will be
worth its trouble. Winners will
receive gold medals. Those who
last  far as the ﬁnals will be
awarded silver prizes.

This will be the last opportun-
ity to sign up. Fill the blank and
return it. Varsity berths are still
open for worthy winners.

Russ Vogel, Dick Conti, and
Herb Turner gained varsity rec-
ognition last year through their
medal-winning victories in the
tournament.

LAST YEAR WINNER

Among the 1937 participants
who were crowned with gloves
and honor were Andy Ventresca,
winner of a close decision over
Paul Ashman in the 165-pound
division, Johnny Wargo, senior
A. M. A. champ, Steve Sikora,
Steve Horton and Jed Curzi.

The weight divisions begin at
115 pounds to 179 pounds. Above
the 179 limit comes the heavy-
weights. The different divisions
run at ten pound intervals with
a leeway of four pounds for over-
weight.

The boxing department is
equipped with all modern con-
veniences for practice and to
avoid injury.

If enough candidates sign up,
the affair will be a success with
all the expert handling, and refer-
eeing.

Mazeski Wants

More Matmen

Ed Mazeski, Pitt’s wrestling
coach, would like to augment his
ﬁfteen candidates with about ﬁf-
teen more to help ﬁll the vacan-
cies on the teams. If interested
report at the stadium ofﬁce any
day between 3:30 and 5:30 o’clock.

Mazeski has some experienced
grapplers back with which to
nucleus the team. Lawrence
Roofner, Rudy Tomarelli, Jimmy
Kosinski, Roger Illsley, George
Yocos, and Luther Richards are
the returning veterans. Lost by
graduation were Harold Niebel,
captain, and Russ Bedillon who
were usually good for victories.

Of the newcomers Frank Kris-
tufek, sophomore, is the most
promising. Kristufek is the Sen-
ior AMA champ and has lost only
one match in four years of wrest-
ling. Last year he captured the
University heavyweight title.

Wrestling teams from Case,
Kent, Franklin and Marshall,
Temple, and West Virginia will
be met. Penn State and Navy
are tentative opponents.

Above you see the handsome

signiﬁcance even though it is only

ence.

For two years it has been
awarded to the football team in
this geographical part of the coun-
try that is considered by a group
of 31 gridiron savants to be the
best team in the East. For these
two years it has been awarded to
Dr. Jock Sutherland’s Pitt Pan-
thers.

The announcement of this year’s
award was made by Henry and
Victor Lambert, who have donated
the cup in honor of their sports-
man father, at luncheon held
Tuesday for the judges in the Na-

tional Democratic Club of New

York City.

Fordham was the only serious

rival to the Panthers and they ﬁn-

ished a good second. Other teams

considered were Harvard, Yale,

By jean Barnes

Iced tea, peanuts and efficiency have been long
noted as the three most pestilential of America’s
vices. I have a third, not so native as these, but
one which has reached a nauseuous perfection in
our own, our native land.

And that vice is our meddling. We can’t keep
our ﬁngers out of places where they really don’t
belong.

No, I’m not going to talk about war. Not this
column. What I’m going to talk about are the lit-
tle haud-books under which we’ve been sub-
merged, and which purport to give us exact and
detailed rules for running our lives.

The prime and most horrible example is Dale
Carnegie’s piece of eﬁrontery, “How to Win Friends
and Inﬂuence People.” Why should we want to
inﬂuence people? Why should we submit our-
selves to inﬂuencing? Why should we give a good
ringing whoop for friends which we have to WIN?

According to my somewhat nebulous theory of
friendship, it’s something which happens, not some-
thing which is a business. It isn’t a matter of
salesmanship. It isn’t a matter of putting your
best foot forward. It isn’t a matter of remember-
ing ﬁrst names.

In fact, with friends you don’t have to REMEM-
BER first names. They come natural. Remember‘?
It’s only with acquaintances and hanger-ons that
you need such a systematic memory as Mr. Carne-
gie advocates.

As far as inﬂuencing people goes, how can you
be so sure you’re right that you can afford to push
your opinions on someone else? That’s all of a
piece with our Christian habit of sending out mis-
sionaries to put pink petticoats on little brown
babies. We have to convert the world. We’re so
sure we're right, so sure our way is the only way,

that we dare “inﬂuence” someone else.

Well, I think it’s a lot of hooey. I think IVII‘.
Carnegie’s book is tripe, his ideas are trite, and his
book-title is just the complacent expression ‘we
might expect from an American Babbitt.

differs from its predecessor, how-
ever, in that its cliffs appear on
the right—hand side of the can-
vas; “Ante Meridian” was cliifed
on the left.
SEA-WATCHER

Frederic J. Waugh, now "in his
seventy-sixth year, has spent
most of his life along the coast
of Massachusetts, near Province-
town, where he has watched the
sea. Mr. Waugh is known all
over the country for his waves.
They have been permanent ones
with Inte;:'nat.ional exhibits since
1908.

Announcement of Mr. Wauglrs
latest as popular award this year
was no revelation to Pittsburgh
art critics. They agree that this
particular type. of marine art
gratiﬁes a particular inner long-
ing of the average citizen for the
wide, roaring ocean.

Something like a hangover
from the days ’way‘ back, when
little boys read about grizzly-
faced pirates that sailed these
same seas. It’s Freudian, I think.

ANNUAL REVENUE

Frederic Waugh has a message
to give to the world. He has been
giving the same one since 1908,
but Pittsburgh International au-
diences, apparently, gobble it up.
And Mr. Waugh gets a steady in-
come of $200 a year. This is nice
teamwork.

6 Having made a total of1,473 de-

terminations, the University’s Al-
ilegheny Observatory leads the
.world in the study of parallax,
the method of determining the
motion of stars.

Since 1914, when the photo-
graphic refractor telescope was
installed, the Observatory staff has
made more than 56,000 plates,
most of them in the determination
of star distances. At present, the
Observatory makes about 125 de-
terminations a year. A

The method of obtaining paral-
lax is to ascertain the apparent
direction of a star from, say, the
Observatory, andlthe apparent di-
rection if viewed from the earth’s
center, according to Dr. Frank C.
Jordan, director of the Observa-
tory.

Several lists of these parallaxes,
the results of the staff studies,
have been published in the As-
tronomical Journal in the last two
years.

An important reason for the Ob-
servatory’s leading position is the
refractory telescope, which has
taken more pictures than any
other telescope in the world. “The
refractory lens records star im-
pressions which the naked eye
cannot see,” explains Dr. Jordan.

Visitors are admitted to the Ob-
servatory, located at Riverview
park, North Side, four nights each
week from April to November.

OVER-ACTIVITIES

Dr. N. Henry Black, Harvard
University:

“We’ve gone crazy on extra-
curricular activities and it’s a
wonder the boys and girls have
any energy left for what still is

the prime business of the schools."
