Phi Beta Kappa
Elects Ten
New Members

Ten new members were elected
to the University Chapter, XI of
Pennsylvania, of Phi Beta Kappa
at the meeting last Friday. _

Those tapped for membership-_
in-course were all seniors. Those
tapped who will be graduated this
month are: Walter J. Fitzpatrick,
Nancy Susan Gross, Robert B.
Hepps, Freda J. Kellams, John
Pekich and Ronald R. Roth.

Candidates for graduation in
April, 1964, are: Merrily Anne

mond Matta. Marianne Seidel was
the only August, 1964, candidate
for graduation to be elected.
Certain Percent Elected
Each chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
elects a certain percentage of the
school graduating class to mem-
bership. Students tapped usually
carry a minimum QPA of 3:50.
Generally, only Liberal Arts stu-
dents are elected. .
“Phi Beta Kappa is, not meant
to separate one man or woman
from his fellow students,” said ,
past chapter president Lawrence
Lee, professor of English. “It is
meant to. recognize early devo-
tion to issues and values larger I
than the self and to support
such unselﬁsh moral and in-
tellectual dedication,” Lee con-
tinued. ,

Paul Jacobs to Present
Classical Piano Concert ,

In an atempt to bring more classical music to
the campus, the P.M. Series has invited Paul Ja-
cobs to give a piano concert. The concert is this
Thursday at 8 p.m. in the SU lower lounge.

This concert, according to Jacobs, is “nicely bal-
anced.” Featured in the recital are works by Ar-
nold Schonburg, Claude Debussy, and Igor Stra-
vinsky. The program begins with Schonberg’s‘Drei
Klavierstucke. It is followed by Variationen by An-
ton Wernen. Klavierstuck V by Karlheinz Stock-
_hausen follows. After that come Suite, Opus 25, by
Schonberg. >

After an intermission, the second half of the
program is devoted to Debussy and Stravinsky,

Jacobs was born in New York City in 1930. He
studied at the Juilliard School of Music, display-
ing an early interest in contemporary music mani-
fested by performances with Robert Craft’s Cham-
ber Arts Society. After his graduation in 1951,
Jacobs gave concerts in Europe until the 1961-
1962 season, when he returned to the United States.

In Europe, he performed on the various radio
networks, and participated in the festivals at
Darmstadt, Dartington, and the Brussels World’s
Fair. He has also toured Austria and Italy, and
lectured in France for the U.S. Embassy.

For the past four summers, Jacobs has been on
the facutly of the Berkshire Music Center in Tan-
glewood, Massachusetts as Fromm instructor in
composition. He was_ also Fromm pianist for the
Princeton Seminar in Advanced Musical Studies
in 1960. —

This fall, Jacobs has already played at Harvard,
Yale, Princeton, Cornell, and California, among
others. He was also pianist for the New York Phil-

harmonic anclaccompained them on their tour of

Ageless Question Sub ect

For Forum Series Panel

The ageless and ever-pertinent question “What
is Creativity?” will be the subject of discussion at
a Forum Series panel to beheld Friday at 3 p.m. in
the SU Supper Room.

Faculty members and students will compose
the panel. Ronald Caplan, Education senior; Lucy

V Correnti, Speech Therapy sophomore; Sunny Cray,

Fine Arts senior; Dr. Wesley Rohrer, Mechanical
Engineering professor; Dr. Robert Merritt, English
professor. Dr. Walter H. Evert, assistant dean of
the Humanities, will moderate the panel.

The panel was an outgrowth of the “intense”
student interest generated by the Midday Series

-speech of Jack Gilbert, renowned poet and Uni-

versity graduate, according to Freda Kellams, For-
um Committee member.

Miss Kellams proposed the idea of this question '

as a possible topic‘ for panel discussion. She ad-
mits the idea sprang from an early morning talk
fest with girl friends Jean Kornfeld and Harriet
Levine.

Panel member Caplan is the editor of Mother,
an infant student publication at the University
which features the writing of students. Several
of his writings have appeared in University pub-
lications.

Miss Correnti is a reporter for The Pitt News
and a member of the Newman Club. She tutored
under the Hill Education Project last trimester.

Miss Cray is a painter who harbors hopes of

Preaching Europe in the near future for graduate

study.

A particular topic to be discussed, according
to Miss Kellams, is the question of creativity in
the social sciences, if it can be expected and nour-
ished in that realm, ascompared to creativity in

Many Committees

 Providing Service toUniver_sity Members

»"»a

. By PAT POLLINO ‘
Should a student take the time to ‘wade through all of the

organizational hoopla, only then could he fully realize the number 

of Student Government committees designed to serve him.

In fact, there are so many committees encompassed by Student
Government, that ‘even group President Martin Landy has to think
twice to account‘ for all of them. ~-

, However, it’s not the number of committees that’s important, but
the service these committees are rendering to the students.
Students Unaware? - V A

That many students are unaware of the method of approach and
progress being made by a number of SG committees is not sur-.
prising. ‘ Committees such as Spirit Award and Publications, stu-

dentshave heard of. Yet how many students know there is a Saga
- _Foods committee, or ’an ID committee?

The Spirit Award committee, revived following a ltwo—year
lapse, has given students an incentive to cheer by offering re-
wards for display of school spirit. Seven trophies will be pre-‘
sented at half-timelat the Penn State ‘game Saturday, recogniz-
ing high-ranked fraternities, sororities, and ‘independent groups
who have partciipated in the spirit award contest.

 “Final figures have not yet been compiled,” «said Ben ‘Cardin,
chairman of the committee. “Competition has been very heavy.” ‘
Favorable Comments _ '

Cardin noted that the committee has received a number of fa-

. . ‘lvorable comments from students and will be activated again next

'~'.

    

’ projects.

fall. l .
Among changes in award procedure recommended by Car-

din are a limit in the number of projects permitted per group, a

maximum point total per week, and more ggaduate students to

evaluate cheering at games. is "

_ He explained that present procedures call for a limit insthe
number of points for signs and banners, but not projects; there is no
maximum point total per week, and four graduate students have
evaluated cheering at games. ‘

Landy Gives Second
. Landy seconded Cardin’s suggested change in project procedure:
“Too much emphasis has been given to. projects,” he said.
. “We must try to minimize. it somewhat.” A
.He added that a rule could be adopted to clarify acceptable
The SG president also pointed out that the committee is
considering an award to be presented to a student group in recog-
nition of its significant contribution to the University community.
' Causes Stir

Another committee which has caused a stir recently has been
the Publications Committee. Having launched an investigation‘ of
The Pitt News, the committee is using criteria prescribed by national

‘ journalism associations in.judging the News. « _
According to Landy, who is acting chairman of the unit,
various segments of the University community are being‘ queried
as to their opinions concerning the News. V ’

The need to evaluate apparently has pervaded the core of Stu-
dent Government activity. Included in the evaluatory group of
‘organizations are the Course Evaluation Committee and Liberal Arts
Cabinet; also, though perhaps somewhat less directly, Health Ser-
Jvice, Saga Foods, ID, Recognition of Student Organizations, and
Perceval Hunt Award committees. '

"A, Sends Letters ,

The Course Evaluating Committe has sent letters -[to "Pennsyl-
-vania, Princeton and Harvard Universities in hopes that perusal of
course evaluation booklets issued at those universities can provide
some basis for engineering the same type project here. i

“It will probably take more than a year (winter ’65) "before
such a booklet can be realized," a spokesman for "the committee ,
said. V

The committee anticipates a coordination meeting with other
student groups expressing interest in such a project. No chairman
has been appointed. ‘ —

Preparing Questionnaire _
‘The Liberal Arts Cabinet, in conjunction with members of the

.University psychology department, is preparing a questionnaire de-. .

A signed to determine the value of 80's courses. Warren Cohn is act-
ing between the Cabinet and the SG Senate. , '
Health Service‘ Committee has conducted a survey of the

, University Health Center, acting on complaints received previ-
f ously from, students. The survey, however, indicated student
satisfaction in the service received at the‘ Health Center. The
. probe will -continue, headed. by. Susan Druckemiller.
K _ Saga Foods Committee‘ chairman Roberta ‘Lieberman has been
conferring with food service representatives in order to iron out
anyproblems, dietary or otherwise. - - A -V -
. .. . -Report Forwarded. . .

A report hasbeen forwarded .to_Uni_versity officials by the ID
Committee recommending a change‘ in format of student identfiica-
tion cards and use of such cards elsewhere than_ at athletic events
(e. g., libraries). Richard Minker and Chuck Gularson are co-

. chairmen.

Self-explanatory is_ the Recognition of Student Organizations.

’_yCommittee headed by Beverly Reifman , and Gularson. New

groups wishing to be recognized as student organizations are
subject to approval of the committee. '

Miss Reifman is also chairman of the Perceval Hunt Award '

Committee, formerly the Student Government Award‘ Committee.
According. to Miss Reifman, full details of the award will be re-
leased to the press Monday. ‘ -
Complements

Two more committees which complement one another are the

Undergraduate Committee and Pitt Preview Committee.
The former serves as a source of student informants dis-~ -—

patched to answer questions of prospective University candidates.

As explained by a committee spokesman, the Undergraduate

,Comr_nit,tee pools‘ the University student body for those interested‘

in talking to high school seniors in" their respective home towns. Co-
‘chairmen are Miss Reifman and Bruce Coull.
Entrants Invited ,
Students accepted, by the University for entrance next fall are
invited by the Pitt Preview Committee to attend‘ a day of events
(spring term) in hopes that they will be ‘orientated somewhat in
proceedings. Miss Reifman is teamedwith Murray Brown on that
committee. - . -~ -
Student Government puts out two activity calendars——Bi-
monthly and Major—and has committees for both.
The Major Calendar (Carl Durant, chair-man) carries a list of
major activities which will terminate with the outset of the spring
term. - - .. - '

_ \ Bi-monthly Breakdown

_ Emily Kleinman heads the Bi-monthly Calendar Committee. In-
cluding a breakdown of major. events every two weeks,‘ the Bi-
monthly Calendar is becoming more useful as more organizations
contribute to it. .. ' A

An innovation this term has been the Regional Campus Com-
mittee. ' Working initially through administrative channels, the
committee is attempting to bridge the gap between regionals and

the Oakland campus. A
. "Over 200 students from the four regional campuses were in-
Vite/d here for theweekend of the Penn State game as originally
scheduled. Co-chairmen are Aileen Harper and Dan Duffy.

, Talks to Chamber. V s
‘The Oakland, Chamber of Commerce has been made a party of
discussion by the Human Relations Committee, headed by Jim Klein-
berg. The committee is seeking better. relations ‘between students
and.local businessmen. / , . ’
Efforts to have a ramp placed on Bigelow Boulevard for'handi-
capped students are being undertaken via discussions with City
of Pittsburgh officials. u '

i ‘The Athletic Committee (‘Ron Cimino, chairman) is working on
plans for accommodation of more date ticket holders to football
games and guest tickets for Trees Pool.

’ _ _ Other Committees

There are also Library, Student Directory, Book Exchange,
Homeco‘ming,_Winter Weekend and‘Cafeteria Study committees. The
committee list does not include, however, such SG projects as travel
to a bowl game, trimester report, international students and parking.
' , “We only expand committees as we feel it necessary.” said —

Landy. V _

The SG president expects Tap Day and Pitt Chest‘Committees

will be added to the already awesome list of committees beginning‘ .

next term.

. Daily L Dry Cleaning, Laundry Service Planned

Men’s Dorm Council will institute a daily laundry and dry clean-
ing service for the dormitories starting with the winter trimester.

The step, taken with full administration approval, is unprece-
dented in University dormitory policy. .

One day service will be offered. And the rates will be ‘lower’
than those prevailing in the Oakland area.

Special Towers Room _

A Center Avenue dry cleaner will pick up and deliver laundry
to a special room to be set up in the Towers. The dry cleaner is re-
putable and has been tested, according to‘ Pete Bijur, president of
Men’s Dorm Council. . ~

“He will provide superior quality cleaning,” said Bijur. “We
secretly tested him and found his work superior.”

Bijur called the service one of the best opportunities for the stu-
dents. He said, ,“It is a tremendousidea and will provide great sav-
ings and speedy service.” _

Two More Advantages
‘- Savings and fast service are the advantages of the new policy.

’ ‘* Here is,.a comparison of proposed prices for the service and the cor-_

A second advantage is the speed of the work. “If students '
leave their laundry by 1 a.m. and request one-day service, the
dry cleaner will deliver the clothes at 4:30 that afternoon,” said
Bijur. He termed the speedy service “fantastic.”

Feiﬁer expressed his sentiments
in the following letter to Miss

“Dear Miss Saﬁer:

If it is at all possible and does
not complicate your plans terri-
bly, I would like to cancel my
‘engagement for next Wednesday,’
postponing it perhaps ’till the
early spring. The reasons I should‘
think are obvious, but I will go
over them anyway. _ .

The death of the President has

be speaking to will feel the same
way. The speech that I had writ-
ten for the occasion is now hope-

that much of it is a criticism ofw
the late President’s. policies,’ I
rather tasteless at this time. ‘ 

Yet, the speech contained just 5
about all that I’ve been able to
observe about America over the
past few years. At the moment
these observation are no longer
cogent, but the time is still too 
new and too raw for me to come 
up with any fresh ones. It will T

By STAN‘ ‘STEIN

A, It takes a good deal of guts to
accuse a pope of committing a
moral crime.

‘The Representative’: Papal Guilt E *

Yet that is what German play-
wright‘Rolf Hochhuth does in his
ﬁrst published drama The Repre-

sentative (D e r Stellvertreter).
First staged in West Berlin in
February, T h e Representative

deals with the failure of Pope

‘Pius.XII to break the Concordat

with Hitler or to otherwise pro-
test the deportation of European
Jews to extermination camps
during World War II. 4

Real Persons
The’ major characters of the

' play are real persons or based

upon the _lives of real individuals.
Kurt Gerstein is, in the play, and
was in life, a German Resistance
worker who joins Hitler’s S.S. in

order to help Jews from the in-'

side. He was shot in ‘a concentra-
tion camp. Riccardo Fontana, a_
member of the Pope’s diplomatic
corps, is the dramatic represen-
tation of Father Maximillian Kol-
_be, who, after failing to convince
the Pope to protest, donsﬂa yellow
-Star of David and travels to an
extermination camp to comfort the
condemned, Father Kolbe “died
with nine others of starvation in
a windowless, dark cell as punish-
ment for the. escape of another
prisoner. In one way or another,
all the characters are real. Even
Pope Pius XII is named. And all,
with the possible exception of The
Doctor, are believable.

In launching his accusation,
Hochhuth wastes not azline. By
the. time his first scene is end-
ed, he has shown the Catholic
Church at Rome to be hypo-
critical, has set up the papal
rationalizations which he will _

the basic, though» not sole, con-
ﬂict. _ ‘

Hochhuth attacks ' immediately
the fundamental purpose and‘

methods of the Catholic Church.
“The Nazi ideology gives us
nothing to be afraid of, but their
ritual is severe competition for
us, and suits the vast majority
very nicely,” the Pope’s ambassa-
dor to Berlin reveals to Father
Fontana. This is aniindication to_
be spoken by a priest, and ques-
tions the basis of organized re-
ligion entirely. '

Straw , Men

The rationalizations which
I-Iochhuth sets up like proverbial

i L

straw men are (1) that the Pope «

desires .to maintain complete neu-
trality during the war; (2) that
Jews, unless they have been con-
verted, ‘do not come under ‘ the
authority of the Church; (3) that

with Hitler’s National Socialism
the only force capable of stop-
ping the Red drive; and (4) that
Hitler’ wil never be able to defeat
both Britain and the United States
anyway. «

The moral crime, charges
Hochhuth, is that strict neutral-
ity, that holy hypocrisy which
denies the ideal of the brother-
hood of man. Hochhuth’s charge
is nothing to shrug off lightly.
It is a serious‘and powerful at-

a tack when the major topic of

conversation in the papal‘ office
is the, profitable liquidation of
_Church holdings in conquered
lands, .. while under the Pope’s
own windows men,’ women and
children are being dragged
away to die by German and
Italian troups. I

As far as the Nazi-characters of

the drama, there is no question in 

Hochhuth’s mind of their guilt. He
has assumed that guilt before

writing the play. The evil of ex- 

termination is not simply a result
of National Socialism ——,it is in-
herent in‘ the movement. Hoch-

huth symbolizes this inherent na- .5

ture in the demoniac Doctor of
Auschwitz — a man whose very
appearance is devil-like.

Not ‘Good’ vs ‘Evil’
The.,_playwright spends, it

sion between good and

evil,

is 0
true, Scene 2, Act V on a discus-

Nazism and Christianity. It is a
conversation between the Doctor

and Father Fontana. It would
seem this conversation, coming as
it does in the climactic act, poses
at least one fundamental proposi-
tion, and indeed the. author ap-
pears to compare the morality of
extermination camps to the mor-
ality of the Inquisition. “It was
your Church ﬁrst showed that one
could burn a man like coke,” the
Doctor argues. This is, however,
such a native and. worn argu-
ment, as.are all of the Doctor’s,
that it cannot be_ a correct com-
parison. There is no argument
between “good” and “evil” in this
drama in the strict sense of -the
terms. What is “evil” is already
understood to be evil, and what
should be “good” is, in reality,
still good, even after the play is
over. Hochhuth would not be so
insensitive as to consider the
Catholic Church or the Pope

“inherently” evil, though he sees
Pius XII as‘ “coldly calculating”
his _own eventual canonization.

The question he asks concerns
the ideals for which the Church
maintained its silence as op- *
posed to the ideal of the broth-
erhood of man. Assuming there
is no question of A good versus
evil, then what the Pope did he
did with the honest thought that ‘

it was the proper and most ef-
fective action. In reality, there-
fore, he committed an error in
judgment. What makes this
“error” a moral crime to Hoch-
huth, however, is the fact that
it was committed by The Pope
-—Christ’s infallible representa-
tive. Hochhuth, a Protestant, is
forced to judge from the stand-
point of a Catholic, because the
Pope did what he did as a Cath:
olic. It is from Catholic stand-
ards, therefore, that the Pope
has committed a moral crime,
not just an error in judgment.
The greater the‘ power, the
greater the sin. ‘

Were the Pope actually power-
less, he would not be culpable,
but Hochhuth, who has done ex-
tensive research on the subject,
proposes that Pope Pius XII, had
he had the courage, could have
alienated some 35 million German
Catholics from‘ Hitler. Hochhuth
says, in fact, that Hitler and all
the ofﬁcers of the Third Reich
always maintained a healthy re-
spect for the power of the Pontiif.
Yet the Pope maintained his neu-
trality, and this to Hochhuth is
the sin, for neutrality, when ra-
tionalized. once can be used as
excuse for all error and crime.-

The Representative is one of
the most powerful plays of the

as controversial as it is, in handled
fearlessly and openly. It has al-

brutal in his condemnation, ex-
hibits a refreshing sense of aca-
demic honesty which, admittedly,
lends credence to his position. It
is a play worthy of discussion in

We would also like to know what positive steps the SG

buttheir accomplishments have not yet reached our ears.

SG also has a Committee to recognize new students organizations on campus,"
but how SG would recognize a responsible organization if it saw one is beyond our
comprehension.- It’s.an old saying that it takes one to know one. _ _ '

they have become separate entities in them selves —' answering vaguely to SG but doing

‘nothing of any real importance.

In The Spotlight

with," Stan Schweiger

What was the magic of Cecil B. DeMille? How. did such a
man become so great a success in a place where successand failure
Why has the name of DeMille left such a last-
ing impression on the American public, and a void that will never
be ﬁlled in Hollywood history? These are some of the questions
that were answered on last Sunday’s television tribute to the late
producer-director. It was titled “The World’s Greatest Showman,”
and was probably the most sentimental, boring and uninspired
tribute ever given a show business figure in the annals of tele-
vision. ,

The show would have. been more truthful had they changed
the title to something like “The Deification of Cecil B. DeMille.”
Never before have so many people tried to turn a very dedicated

and hard-working fi-gure into a God of sorts. To use the word ,,

“embarrassing” would be doing this-presentation justice. The show
was an hour and a half in _length, which is a record for a television
biography- Apparently the creators involved figured that enough
rhetoric, nostalgia, and sensational scenes from DeMille epics would
be enough to please the viewer, and send him away with a deified
portrait of a movie-maker. Even Bob Hope was along to add a
And Billy Graham, the Rev.
Dr. Graham, appeared at the end to introduce a scene from “The
Ten Commandments” and complete the canonization. I did enough
squirming in my chair to_ give Blaze Starr a run for her money.
Eulogizers Trace Careers , .

It was a program that in grandeur and depth would have done
Mr. DeMille proud. Many stars were around to introduce various
segments of his career and themany ﬁlm clips from the DeMille
Library. Among the euloglazersiwere Charlton Heston, Cornel Wilde,

’ Betty Hutton, Edward G. Robinson, Yul Brynner, James Stewart,

and, for real nostalgia, Gloria Swanson. V These people helped trace
the career of the young man from the east "who took Horace Gree-
ley’s advice andiwent west. ‘He, along with Jessie Lasky and the
eminent Samuel Goldmyn formed a partnership that was to evolve
into Paramount Pictures, and achieved instant success with a wild-
west epic called “The Squad _Man.” From here on in, except for
two brief years early -in the depression, and the beginning of_talk-
ing pictures, Mr. DeMille was at the top of the motion picture
heap. He was a king of the silent _screen and his flamboyant,

boisterous outdoor yarns coupled with those wild bedroom traves- »

ties of the roaring twenties gave the director tremendous popu-
larity if but little critical acclaim. . The director decided to bring
the pages of the Scriptures to the then small screen and so were
born the original “Ten Commandments,” and “King of Kings,” two
movies of immense popularity and critical adulation. .
That was the great heyday of the talkies, and the box-offices
‘ bulged with receipts from DeMillean_ extravaganzas. VVhen the
talkies came on strong, the director suffered because of his
actors’ poor voices and styles that were outmoded for talking.
pictures. A brief two-year rut followed in which the man
couldn’t get a job. He was thought ,of as being “box-office poi-
son,” a not too-flattering description. Then the director gave
his eager public of the twenties a new image for the thirties.
He chose huge , themes such as “The Crusades,” “Cleopatra,” ,
“Union Pacific,” and others of that ilk and, using the enlarging
screen, ‘the technicolor cameras, the latest sound techniques,
DeMille emerged once again as the top man on the totem pole.
There followed the recreations of _top movies on his top-rated '
DeMille Radio Theatre, and the recent mammoth productions
that have made D'eMille analogous to spectacle. These were
“Samson and Delilah,” “The Greatest Show on Earth,” and the
remake of “The Ten Commandments.” When he died, a tradition
died with him and an era was over.< The era of the big studio
bosses and the film pioneers had drawn to close and the new
era of independent companies and new images had begun.
That DeMille [was the, master of his field, the ‘movie spectacle,
was very much in evidence during the entire show. All of the
film clips shown, except for the beautiful sequence from “King of
Kings” and Gloria _Swanson’s bath scene in “Male and Female,”
had the, usual component parts synonymous with the man: the
thousands of extras, the wars and battles, the spectacle of a sink-
ing ship, a blown-up zeppelin, a three-ring circus, et al. In effect,
that last detail from his 1953 Oscar-winning spectacle “The Great-
est Show on Earth,” -might be the overall description of the De-
Mille epic. They-were all three-ring circuses. The public thrived
on costumes, scenery and situations that were all on a huge scale
and one shouldn’t gulp when the figure of paying customers for
all the DeMille epics is given at four and a half billion people!
‘Actors Begin 'l'o Look Alike > ' - ’ —
There was an almost over-monotonous effect‘ received by this
person from the film clips of DeMille’s epics. Every actor began
to look the same, the music sounded as if one long-playing record
was used ot background all of his films, and the costumes from
one film looked like leftovers from a previous film. The narra-
tion by the stars proved to be boring and out of focus with the
clips that were shown. If DeMille was a sincere and humble
man according to Cornel Wilde or Betty Hutton, the film clip that
followed would be laced with violence and bloodshed—-an embar-
rassing paradox. The nostalgic bit was overdone to a frighten-
ing point. Some person in the backgroundkept on" uttering com-
mands and signals in the great DeMille tradition and the creators
wanted us to believe that his presence was still with us—a child-
ish and ridiculous technique to use on a supposedly “enlightened"
public! The sequences of rapid transcriptions featuring such late
stars as ..Ronald Coleman, Jean Harlow and Clark Gable was over-
done with applause after a plause and _tl__1e roriginality of-. the idea.

and the other on the mailbox for possible job offers in reply to his application for position. For

Of innumberable types of positions available in publishing houses, edi-

In a brief synopsis of‘ the thoughts of Daniel Melcher, Publishers’ Weekly ' S
representative, manuscript (copy) editing can involve anything from total re-
writing to, checking facts, spotting possible libelous statements, catching incon-

sistencies (spelling and punctuation), etc. Actually Melcher does not use the

terms “manuscript” and “copy” interchangeably, as such, but for all matters of

purpose they can stand ordinarily as one. at ' A‘
One concludes from. digesting what Melcher has to say that publishing

‘houses, as IS true of any ﬁrm you might care to mention, are on the lookout for “men of outstand-
ing ability,” . . . men with a trained eye for correctness. ‘ I '

William Bourke,‘ a former copy reader with the New York Daily News, states that “names

and spellings are the copy reader's specialty."

Obviously names and spellings are ‘important, and editorial departments of publications do
strive to attain, correctness. But what about other departments of publishing houses -- the per-
sonel department being one? I say this because of a letter I received recently from a certain

publishing house, envelope addressed:

“Miss Patrick” Anthony Pollino.”

Now, I for one, don’t know of a single person with the name Patrick Anthony who might

be a girl. The letter read in "part:

“Dear Miss‘ Pollino:

Too Many Safety S./Weasuresg

  Lower Presidential Prestige 

By JIM KLEINBERG ' . “'

In light of ‘the recent tragic; assassination of
President Kennedy, there have been many sug-
gestions raised about -the protection of future
Presidents. Needless to say, all Americans are

concerned about this subject
and want to be sure that their

at all times, as he indeed
should be. But some of the
suggestions are ludicrous, and
I am sure President Johnson
will not follow them. ’

The ﬁrst, and most obvious
suggestion is that the President

 

cover on his car regardless of
weather. As we all know, on
the fateful day of November 22, President Ken-

nedy ' had the top removed. The implication of

 

the President not being allowed to remove this

cover is frightening, I think, because it suggests
that (1) the President is not safe among his own
people, and (2) the President can be further re-
moved from contact with the public. The second
suggestion would merely add to the lack of com-

'munication between our high oﬂicials and the

people, already a growing problem with the com-
bination of larger population and complex
problems.

The second suggestion is that the President
should not travel to hostile areas in the nation.
Despite the dislike felt by many Texans for the
President’s program, surely we cannot blame this
tragedy on hostile southerners merely because
the event took place in the south. The crazed
madmen who assassinate Presidents are concerned
with location only as a matter of convenience,
not for any ironic motives. Further, the Presi-
dent’s refusal to visit parts of his own nation
would inevitably lead to a weakening of the ofﬁc
of the Presidency itself. —

No longer could a President represent to us, let
alone to the Free World, ‘rigorous and courageous
to

be forced to use the bubble-top .

 
    

1=rave1isWith,in -the. boundaries  , thelrmtiorz : .

Americans create the superhuman image of the.

Presidency in the minds of their children. _.The
President wouldjbe very human, and just as frail

as we, if he would shy from challenges such as

these shocking acts of violence.

Above all, the President must represent order,
competence, and rationality to the American sys-
tem. He must stand like a tree in a Windstorm
to modify the extremes of political pressure, quiet

the hysterical, and build conﬁdence in the people. '

All of this is particularlytrue in these times; the
grave peril of nuclear war, of total annihilation,
make. the conditions right for all forms “of de-
viant behavior. _ ' »

The. proportion of the mad compared to the
sane has, we can be sure, ‘risen. all over the world

in the last twenty years. The tensions of a pro-

longed cold war, the “protracted con_ﬂict” of more
than a generation, is -taking its toll. No society can
survive with its ideals of justice, freedom, and
humanitarianism with ﬁfty billion dollars being
spent on armament and defense at the same time.
The threat of growing militarism, emotionalism,
and hysteria hovers over this‘society at all times.

We are living in what psychologists would
call an “approach-approach” conﬂict situation-;
we are tempted with the prospects of war to end
the tensions of a defensive position, and we are
tempted to withdraw from the struggle and re-

linquish the claim to world leadership. Yet we

know either choice is wrong, by comparison with
history ‘and codes of morality.

There is one high oﬁice which can show us

the knowledge of history and morality necessary I

to guide us in a struggle that will last our life-
times and beyond. This office is the Presidency,
where resolute action and rational behavior can
set a model for the nation. President Johnson
‘will be out next year to shake hands with his
fellow Americans. Let us be there to greet him
and let him know that we believe in the words
of his eloquent predecessor, that “however close
we somtimes seem to that dark and ﬁnal abyss,
let no man of peace and freedom despair . . . it

‘we can in every land . . . look _beyond our own ~ .
shores and ‘ambitions, then surely the age will, r L

L Doctors Study Heart, Arteries

Doctors Perform Auto
Transplantation in Dog

By JACKIE KATZ

Several rooms in the Scaife Hall Medical Cen-
ter are now television studios as doctors prepare

‘  a weekly program on diseases for community hos-

pitals.

The program is broadcast every Friday from v

.11 a.-m. to noon over UHF Channel 16 (WQEX)
directly from the medical center. It continues

every week throughout the aca-
demic year, according to Dr.
‘Campbell Moses, director of Post-
graduate Medicine in the Univer-
sity School of Medicine.

The ﬁrst program, which took

place November 15, concerned
congestive heart, failure. It was
presented by _Dr. Jack‘ D. Myers,
chairman of the department of
medicine. The second program
told about strokes and was mod-
erated by Dr. Lowell G. Lubic,
assistant professor of psychiatry‘
_in the medical school. ,

T.V.,” Dr. Moses explained,‘ “but
one must have a special adap-
ter for UHF on his set to receive
the program. It is primarily de-
signed in every aspect for doc-
tors. All doctors listening have _
‘the opportunity to call in ques-
tions while the program is on and
have‘ them answered on the air.”
Besides working with the
television program, Dr. Moses
has presented a paper and
movie on television techniques
and on postgraduate teaching
_ by television. P
Television though is «not the
only thing Dr. Moses concerns
himself with. At scientiﬁc meet-
ings of the American Heart Asso-
ciation, Dr. Moses and other re-
search experts conducted a con-
-ference ‘on “The Pathogenesis of
Arterioc1erosis.” This is a con-
ference concerning hardening of
the arteries. ~

The conference included a dis
cussion -on the things which in
crease the rate of the hardening :2
of the arteries. ,

Dr. Moses explained that in
' the last four to five years researchers have been
able to measure the contribution which fats in
;the blood make to inﬂuence the hardening. The

-doctors also have made substantial improvements

3“ °°nt!'0“ihg the level of fats in the blood
circulation. .

_D1'- -M0595 explained that there is much more
reliable information available now on the normal
levels‘ of blood fats. “Information is rapidly ac-
cumulating which pointsto the fact that the ideal
levels of blood fats for prevention of arteriosclerosis
are those levels found in young men and women
in the late teens and early twenties,” he continued.

He feels that if we can maintain these levels
throughout life, we can substantially decrease the

mt. L. M. NAPOLITANO
Help Perform Auto—Transplant

A heart, when detached from the rest of the
body, still has some active nerves functioning. This
was found out by Dr. L. M. Napolitano, assistant
professor of anatomy in the University?s School of
Medicine, and a group of surgeons from St. Louis.

Dr. Napolitano and the other surgeons have
been doing experiments ‘involving auto—transplants.

“ ‘ They have removed _a heart from
a dog for approximately an hour
and put itback. After the heart
was returned to the body of the
dog, the animalwas observed for
any V changes in his behavior.
None were’ found. a 7

The A doctors- took the heart
from the. dog _for a- twofold pur-
pose. First they were interested
in whether or not there were any
changes" in the ﬁne structure of
the hearth cell after the heart‘ had
_ been replaced. Studies with : an

e l e.,c t r o-microscope’ afterwards,
A showed that there were not any
changes in the ﬁne structure, ac-
cording to Dr. Napolitano.

The second main} interest’ of
the doctors’is' to 'ﬁnd out whether
or not the heart is inﬂuenced from
nerves from the outside‘.

Dr. .Napolitano reports ‘that
there’ is an indication that such '
nerves existing within.;the heart

are distributed throughout all
chambers of the organ, and they
maintain themselves independ-
ent of the central nervous sys-
tem connections.

“When we removed the heart
all the extrinsic nerves -are re-
moved and the heart becomes de-
generate after a while,” Dr.
Napolitano explained. If the
nerves in the heart arrive from
intrinsic nerves within the heart
itselfrather thanfrom the central
nervous system, the heart can
maintain itself" when it is de-
tached from the body.

When the doctors. removed the

_heart did contain nerves in all
areas which indicated, that there

the ventricles, according to Dr. Napolitano.

The doctor-’s work is aimed at determining the
effect of"drugs and hormones on animals with all
nerves to the heart interrupted in this way. Such
studies,-Dr. Napolitano explains, may help lay a
ﬁrm foundation of knowledge for the time when
hearts will be successfully transplanted from one
animal to another of the same species.

Dr. Napolitano and the rest of the surgical team
hope ultimately, through their studies, to gain more
knowledge of cardiophysics with regard to the af-
fects of nervous system and of drugs onthe heart.
This knowledge is necessary to make homo-trans-

- plantation feasible. .

Dr. Napolitano reported on the work of his sur-
gical team at the. American Heart Association’s
36th scientiﬁc sesions last October. ‘

VOUTER VIEW ._ Riverside

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

George Russell Sextet —- THE
RM
440; “You Are My_Sunshine,” “Au
Privave,” “Zig Zag,” “The Outer
View,” “D. C. Divirtimiento.”

Personnel: Russell, piano; Don
Ellis, trumpet; Paul Plummer,
tenor saxophone; Garnett Brown,
bass;
Pete LaRoca, drums.\

In listening to this collection of
a.vant—garde compositions and ar-
rangements by Russell, one is
struck by the pertinence of Duke
Ellington’s comment that jazz is
meaningless if it does not swing.
“It doesn’t mean a thing if it ain’t
got that swing”. '

%i/ Happily, Russell’s music swings.

Though expressed in an individu-
alistic idiom, these performances
are melodious and swinging.

' The tracks here only approach

_ the most shortsightedly-n a In e cl

\

“New Thing” in that they provide
a framework for somewhat dis-
jointed solos by Ellis, a -known
proponent of that new idiom.
New for Writers

But Russell’s work represents a
“New Thing” of sorts for writers
and arrangers. His. development

‘of songs is like_ that of a theme

for a novel. He "manipulates
rhythms, completely alters moods,
and, with sharp insight, brings
out different views of. the music,
facets previously unimagined.

In particular Russell milks
“Sunshine” for every possible
effect. The young arranger em-
bellishes this composition with
all sorts of rhythmic settings,
ranging from the intriguingly-
dissonant, tempo-less opening to
a heated closing, with a larrup-i
ing midsection rhythm that is
ideal for his soloists?

On “Sunshine” Russell has also
chosen to feature Sheila Jordan,

most ridiculous sense of that
cliche, i.e., she has been around
for years). Miss Jordan comes in
a capella on one key,,changes in
midstream to another, more re-
mote key, and proceeds to tell a
most haunting story using those
same, otherwise trite, words pen-

ned a considerable time ago by‘

that noted musicologist, Governor
Jimmy Davis, of Louisiana.

An Individual Style

Miss’ Jordan has a needle-clear ._

voice that can be moaning or teas-
ing._ Hers is an individual style

and——more importantly—an effec-

tive one. No one else on the mu-
sical scene could sing her part
here.

Russell leads the sextet on
piano. He plays in a perfunc-
tory manner, using mainly a
block chordal approach in pro-
viding bridges for the frequent
changes of rhythm in his ar-
rangements.

Ellis, on trumpet, is hard toitake
seriously.’ His solos consist of
grunts, bleats, garbles, moans, and
chortles. He effectively hides the
fact that he is a fantastic tech-
nician with a pleasing tone. One
of his solos consists of a develop-
ment of a theme which was a

series of slurred triplets, each

about one—quarter second long,

spaced about one-half second

apart.
2 Focus Is Defect

The defect of this type of solo
is that the‘vlistener’s attention is
focused on the. artist’s method in-
stead of his effect. In one recent
in—person performance, Ellis tore

.up a telephone book while his

partner was soloing. This is part

of the “New Thing?” It makes the
reviewer laugh—and shudder. V
Garnett Brown on trombone
has a silky, smooth, yet strong
tone. His solos are more con-

an overnight discovery (in the sistent and less obscure than

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Twenty students graduating in
June are the first products of the
University’s ﬁve-year pharmacy

curricula. Part of a nationwide .

revamping of pharmacy schools on
an undergraduate level, these stu-
dents are among the ﬁrst grad-
uates of this program in the coun-
try.

The program was initiated in
September 1960. Because of the
trimester plan, the University is

A V. one of the few schools to have a

graduating class this year.
Two Years of ‘Liberal Arts

‘. Included in the pharmacy cur-
_,1_'icula are two years of pre-pHar-

macy, basically liberal arts, and

three years. of pharmacy, taught

exclusively in Scaife Hall;

This year's -graduating class
is an”“experimental class,” ac-
cording to Dr. Joseph A. Bian-
culli, _Dean of the School of
Pharmacy. Because of the small
size of the class, it is possible

. to test new methods of instruc-
tion for student reaction and

 future teaching reference.

Another feature of the small
class is that it enables professors

 to give personalized instruction.
':Students seem to be stimulated to

study more because of the greater
interest taken in each class‘ mem-

- her by the instructor. This is evi-
-denced by a general QPA rise in

the school.

Small Class

The small size of the class also
encourages closeness among its
members, 17 men and 3 women. A
close knit group, they “sing songs
in the hallways and are notorious
for their spirit,” according to
Allan Koff, pharmacy senior. “We
are planning a ﬁnal party for
next trimester which-will be one
unequaled in the school;”

An annual event of the grad-
uating class is a trip to one or
more of the major pharmaceu-

" tical companies. The week of
Novemberz, this class invaded

- , Michigan and Indiana.

The students hired a bus and set
off for the ‘ Upjohn Company,
Kalamazoo, Michigan; Eli Lilly
and Company, Indianapolis, In-
diana; Ames Laboratories, a divis-
ion of Miles Laboratories, Elkhart

‘Indiana; and Notre Dame, South

Bend, Indiana.
Not Without Dates

“We weren’t without dates on
the trip,” noted Koff. “At every
stop we’d call the local nurses’
residence and get dates.” ‘

Commenting on some high-
lights of the trip, Koff reported
that “taking a popular tune, one
student composed a song satiriz-A
ing various profs in the school.

' We taunted the professors who
were on the trip by singing the
song cross-country.

“At Upjohn, a funny incident
occurred when the class was in-
troduced to a gentleman who was

a department head. To me, this

gentleman appeared to be a ‘mir-
ror image’ of the dean .(of the
pharmacy school). The apparent
similarities of the appearances of

Receives Grant  

The School of Pharmacy has
received a $10,000 grant from the
Atomic Energy .Cqmmission for
the equipping of a’ radio isotope
laboratory.

-The grant, announced by Dr.
Joseph A_. Bianculli, Dean of the
School of Pharmacy, was obtained
through the joint efforts of Dr.
Anthony A. Paruta, assistant.pro-
fessor of pharmacy, and Dr. Eu-
gene E. Vogin, assistantprofessor
of pharmacology.

Basis For A Course

The laboratory will be used as
a basis for a course to be given
to undergraduate students in radio
isotope methodology.

present “Atomic Age,” the phar-

vmacist must play an ever in-
creasing role in the understand-
ing of and dissemination. of in-
formation in radiation, health,
physics and possible attendant
dangers.

The community pharmacy and
the pharmacist must possess in-
formation concerning the bio-
logical effects and potential dan-
gers associated with radioactive
materials since the role of radio-
active medicines has become an
important diagnostic and curative
medical tool to both medicine
and pharmacy.

Dr. Bianculli noted that “this is
going to add to our research po-
tential because it means that we
are going to be able to expandour
activities in tapped atom research
and teaching.”

as Gen. George Armistead ‘temporarily carried the Union position

during Pickett’s charge at Gettysburg. .
(Leslie’s Illustrated History of the Civil War)

\

his way back up the _ladder
of success after’ his defeat
in Arkansas until his girl
friend’s‘husband_ puts an un-
timely bullet through his
head; and the gaping pri-
mate who is President of the
United States, Abraham Lin-
coln. ' ‘ ~ 

All are therein all their his-
torical colors, and most of the
credit for their portrayal must ‘
go to author Foote who has
scoured his sources _ to make
h i s characterizations slightly
more than perfect.

Mr.‘ Foote is also just as

perfect. in his description of the

battles, V speeches, conferences,
and campaigns as he is in por-
traying the people who take
part in- them." When Hooker

[blows his big chance on the

morning of the third day at
Chancellorsville,‘ the reader al-

most wants to A jump up and

shout: “Oh, you jerk!-I You ‘let

'» Lee get away.‘-"

Again, out in th e West,
the stench of three thousand .
dead bodies lying in _ front

' v

of the parapets of Vicksburg
drifts upward from the‘
pages like a clear ‘vapor. The
Civil War: A Narrative is a

ma sterful combination of
ﬂawless characterization and
vivid description .which' pre-
sents the mighty contest. be-
tween the states in the most
powerful manner possible‘ in
print. V
The‘ book is detailed to the
point where the reader knows
the color of Lee’s beard and
what type of cigars Grant
smoked, yet these endless facts
are woven into the text so
masterfully that one is never
aware that he is being bom-
barded with, batches of ‘trivia.
After a while, the reader wants

'to know the color of Lee’s

The volume, viewed in this

glight, is a‘ story of gradual
. disintegration.

It is the- story
of a Confederacy which has
managed -— inspite of severe
difliculties -— to hold its own
against- the growing power of
the North, and how that same’
Confederacy was bettered by
skill, bad luck, and the odds.

It is the story of growing
optimism that the South can
pull its chestnuts_ out of the
ﬁre and how the fates\of, two
men decided otherwise. The
ﬁrst was
who refused to remove Grant

from his command after seven '

successive defeats and thus
gave him the encouragement
which carried him to the [great
Fourth of July victory at Vicks-
burg which sealed the fate of
the Western Confederacy.

. The second man of fate was-
the great Stonewall Jackson

whose’unti_mely death at Chan-
cellorsville deprived Lee of the
only man who could put into
operation his brilliant tactics.

down to defeat at Gettysburg
and the Southern domination
of the war in Virginia came
to an end. From then on, it was

i only aquestion of time, and Mr.

Foote brings his narrative to
a conclusion with- the end of
the Confederacy just in sight
‘over the horizon.

in this Pittsburgh march, just as
he did in the march -on Wash-
ington August 28.

“Civil Rights needs the assist-
ance of‘ legislation,” Reverend
Schrading said. The Write-In-"for
Rights campaign was designed to
provide this needed assistance in
theform of letters-to-your-Con-
gressman.
seven thousand attended this ral-

'ly held that Sunday afternoon’

at the Smithfield Congregational
and _Methodist churches in down-
town Pittsburgh. ;
CORE Poses Question
Marchers heard Mayor Joseph
M. Barr of Pittsburgh read a let-
ter that he had written in re-
sponse to the campapign.« The
main speaker, Jerome Smith,
national co-ordinator for CORE,
(Committee on Religious Equali-
ty), then proceeded. to answer a
rhetorical question, “Who needs
civil‘ rights .
. His answer: Any man, blac ,
or white who has been deprived
of his right-to be a man needs
civil rights‘ legislation.
Following the rally, -the march-
ers proceeded to the downtown
post office where an estimated
6,000 letters to Congress were
mailed.
A Positive‘ Gains '
_ Reverendschrading, who felt
that the Pittsburgh rally had con-
tributed proportionately with the

"Washington march to‘ the cam-

paign, pointed out thespecific po-
sitive gains of the local rally. The
Write~in-For-Rights “brought the
whole topic of actual legislation
for rights ‘directly into the Pitts-
burgh area.” The rally expressed
the conviction that legislation
should not be a concept but a‘
reality. ,
Civil rights legislation is
deﬁnitely not a lost cause to
Reverend Scharding who is‘
looking forward to strong leg-
islation in the near future. The
Reverend notes that the‘ cam-
paign which was established
prior to President Kennedy’s.
assassination, now looks to
President Johnson for support.
The University’s student'chap-
ter of the NAACP played an ac-

_tive role in the promotion; and
Write—In~

actualization of the
Campaign, said chapter president,
dis-
tributed over 5,000 leaﬂets
Chath-am, Duquesne, «Carnegie
Tech and the University in pro-
motion‘ of the rally. ‘'
—Heinz Chapel Rally

At 2 _o’clock on the day of the
march, Reverend Edward Biegert,
a campus chaplain, directed a
rally at Heinz chapel for" those
who could not_ participate in the
downtown , march._ » Folksinging
groups sang freedom songs as 50

to 75 stu_'d__ents_t were  attend-A

ance. _-_ _ -' _ _

' Proctor made a ‘strong issue of
the fact that the = Wr_ite—In -was
not -a one day campaign, and is
not over. “There is still a need
for more letters to your Congress-
man, for at the time of the Write-
In-For-Rights, the correspondence

_ received at the capital was three

to one against. As is true, in oth-
er fields, only those who are op-
posed have been making them-
selves known.” '

The Student Union Board is
sponsoring a. dance after the

  THE BELL TELEPHONE COMPANIES  
smuns: GENE LINDACHER    

After promoting Gene Lindacher (B.A., 1957) up the
ladder from Traﬁic Assistant in Ridgewood to Trafﬁc Mana- .
ger for the Paterson District, New Jersey Bell handed him
a new challenge. They named him Plant Service Super-
visor for Repair in the 43,000-customer Dover area.

This meant that after managing operators and their
supervisors (all women), he was suddenly put in charge
of-a highly technical group of repairmen and other tele-
phone techn ioians. A '

jGeI_1_e’s increased responsibilities came about because «

/v

4(-
:-I .r; 

of‘ his outstanding performance in Trallic Department.
Knowing that good managers can step into new situations
easily, New J ersey.Bell did not hesitate to move Gene into

the more technical Dover job.

- 124$‘: E

New Jersey Bell considers Gene a versatile young mana-

ger with, an unlimited future. Not

a bad reputation to have!

Gene Lindacher, like many young men, is impatient to

' make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded-than in the fast-growing telephone business.

Spanish Education

Dr. William L. Fichtner, visit-
ing Andrew Mellon Professor of
Romance Languages, told a lec-
ture series audience Monday night
the story of “A Great Spanish
Educational Institution: The Res-
idencia de Estudiantes, 1910-1936.”

The Residencia de Estudiantes,
Dr. Fichtner noted, was a tutor-
ial college established in 1910 by
an educational commission of the
Spanish government. It was
closed, however, during the Span-
ish Civil War and has not been
continued since. ‘ '

Dr. Fichtner is an American
scholar of the Golden Age of
Spanish literature. He has been
associated with the faculty "of
Brown University since 1928 as
a professor of Spanish language
and literature.

5 Panthers, Duquesne Favored‘
In Tournament Openers F riday.

 

 

Backcourt Wizards Dave Roman (left) and Willie Somerset May Face Each Other Saturday

By ART FLEISCHNER I
Chances are that this Saturday, Pitt will play

its chief rivals in both football and basketball. .

Saturday afternoon at the Stadium the Panthers
play Penn State. While this game is deﬁnite, the
one at night in the Field House_ is not.

But if things hold true to form then Pitt and
Duquesne will meet in the ﬁnals of the Steel
Bowl as they have done every time except once.

The Panthers won last year 85-59 as Dave
Roman hit on his ﬁrst four shots, and the
Panthers were never headed. Brian Generalo-
vich won the MVP award scoring_ 25 points
against the Dukes. In the 1961 ﬁnals, won by
Duquesne, 73-70, Willie Somerset received the
trophy. ‘

Both players are the key to their respec-
tive teams. Generalovich scored 13 points last
Saturday night as the Panthers defeated Fair-
ﬁeld, 82-62. Midway in the second half Gen-
eralovich fell heavily and sat out the rest of
the game. -

This is the second time this year that he’s
come close to injuring himself seriously. He is
still not in top shape and probably won’t be for
the games this weekend. ' 1

Against Fairﬁeld four other players scored
in double ﬁgures. Cal Shefﬁeld had 18, Dave

..Sauer 15, Paul Krieger 14 and Dave Roman ten.
This pattern is similar to last season when the

scoring was well" divided.

In the second half of the double-header,
Duquesne defeated American University, 99-59.
Willie Somerset was the top scorer of the night
with 29 points.

More importantly, however, is what his
presence meant to the team after a one year’s
absence. Against American, Duquesne had
their troubles until Somerset began to score
and pass off. His ﬂurry of points at the ends
of_ the first half gave Duquesne the lead, and

his scoring in the second half broke the
game open.

Center John Cegalis and forward Dennis Cuff
also played well for Duquesne. Ron Willard, a
guard and Willy Ross, a forward are the other

I Duquesne starters. After these ﬁve, though, Du-

quesne is not strong. _

Duquesne’s opening opponent is Westminster.
The Titans opened their season last night against
Alliance. The charges of coach Buzz Ridl pre-
sent a strong team every year, but they will be
underdogs to Duquesne.

The same is true of Pitt’s foe, George Wash-
ington. The Panthers will be heavy favorites
to advance to the ﬁnals against Duquesne. This
past Saturday night George Washington played
the number two team in the country, Cincinnati,
and were defeated, 101-65.

, After the Fairfield game coach Bob Tim-
mons said, “We made some ﬁrst game mis-
takes, but we’ll take care of- them. I was real
pleased with the defense of our guards. Op-
posing teams are going to have a tough time
scoring and passing from the outside.”

Although the Panthers are not as strong as
they would be with a healthy Generalovich, they
still have the reserves to ﬁll in. Against Fair-
ﬁeld, Daryle Ruby played well ﬁlling in for
Generalovich.

Another reserve, sophomore center Bob
Lovette also saw considerable action. He showed
some ﬁrst game jitters, however, Timmons was
not afraid to use him when the Panthers were
behind, late in the ﬁrst half.

A_ surprise player was sophomore guard
Larry Szykowny. Szykowny saw only limited
service and went scoreless, but indications are
that coach Timmons will use him more and
more.

If things go well this Saturday, the Panthers

will be celebrating two bowls: the,:St.eeLLBow1-. , 

and possibly the Cotton Bowl. '

;_Steel Bowl Tourney Opens Friday

 

Achievement of the best
seasonal record in twenty-
six years will be the Pan-
ther football team’s goal
when they meet the Penn
State Nittany Lions Satur-
day at the Stadium, 1 p.m.

The gridders added vic-
tory number eight last Sat-
‘urday night, when they out-
scored the Miami‘ Hurri-
canes, 31-20, despite a fan-
tastic passing display by
Miami’s George Mira who
hit 25 of 43 tosses for 309
yards. Miami sportscaster
Clure Mosher said on a
television interview, “Mira’s

.difference between him and
Staubach is the diﬁerence
between night and day.”.

The Panther quarterback,
Fred. Mazurek, put on a
show of his own. The junior
signal-caller broke the all-
time Panther single season
total offense record. He ran

- for 146 yards and passed for
149, bringing his total to

ren Heller had in 1931'.

The Panthers, third in of-
fense in the nation, picked
up 498 yards rushing and
pasing against the tissue-
like Miami defensive line.
Every time the Panthers got
the ball, they threatened to
score. Four times they were
stopped on downs inside the
Miami 35. The total offense
production was the highest
this season.

Two key muffs by Miami
cost them the game. With
the Panthers leading 28-20
in the fourth quarter, Ned
Sparks dropped a sure
touchdown pass when no-
body was near him. Later,
the Hurricanes failed to
push the ball over the goal
line in four tries from the
Panther three. .

All-American Halfback
Paul Martha also showed

The Panthers’ scoring
started in an unusual way.
Penalties had forced the
Hurricanes back to their
own two when they at-
tempted a punt. The snap
from center was high and
the'ball sailed out of the
end zone giving the Pan-
thers an automatic safety.

The Panthers’ 31 points
upped the season’s total to
214, the most since 1931.

.This marked the third oc-
casion the gridders have ta1- ‘

lied over thirty points this
season, and the sixth time
they have registered four
touchdowns.

The encounter with Penn
State Saturday will be the
63rd meeting between the
two teams. The Panthers
have won 33, the Lions 26,
and five have ended in ties.
The Lions have won the
last three games," with the
last Panther victory com-
ing in a stunning upset in
1959. That year the Pan-
ther line, led by Mike Dit-
ka, buried Richie Lucas, in
a 22-7 romp.

A Panther win and a Na-
vy loss will put the Pan-
thers in the Cotton Bowl
against Texas. This spot is
the only one open in any

;major bowl. Despite an
8-1 record and number three
ranking in the country the
bowl officials have shunned
the’ Panthers. 1A victory
over Penn State will be a

great finish for the seven- "S

‘teen seniors that are play- _
ing their last college game..;

_ Saturday’s game in Philadelphia between
Army and Navy will be the biggest game of
the season as far as the Panther football team

-is concerned. The outcome of that game will
determine whether the Panthers get a bowl bid

coaches, they will
not get a bowl’ bid

' unless Army beats

Navy. Navy "is the
choice of the Cotton
Bowl selection com’-
mitt e e to play"
Texas, if A they can
get by the Cadets.

‘If they don’t it is

generally believed the bid will. go to Pitt."
The Panthers will still have to get past Penn
‘ State on Saturday if they are to get the bid.
The Cotton Bowl is the last hope for the

Panthers since the remaining spot in the Gator.

Bowl, the team’s other hope, has been taken.

That’s what athletic director Frank Carver.
-says. “Another-school has been picked to play

North Carolina,” Carver said. “I can’t divulge

who the team is, but if they win on Saturday,

they’ll get the bid. And they’re a sure bet to
win.”

The team Carver was talking about is gen-
erally believed to be the Air Force.

Even if the Air Force loses on Saturday
Carver doesn’t think the Panthers will be ask-
ed. “They have a back up teamin mind,” Carver
said, “and’I don’t believe it’s us. At least 
haven’t heard anything‘ about it.” MlSS1SSlpp1
Stateis believed to be thelbackup team.

Carver said the snubbing by the Gator Bowl‘
S selection committee of the Panthers 1S quite

simple. “The selection committee voted against

us’ eight to ﬁve. The ﬁve members who saw us

play voted for us. The eight members who didn’t
see us play voted against us. It was that simple.”-

Carver said that rumors that the Panthers
were snubbed because he was_ cool towards a

Gator Bowl feeler are untrue.

“We got a feeler,” the athletic director said,
“and we told them that the" Gator Bowl was
not our‘ primary interest. But this had no effect
on us not getting the bid. These men are per-
sonal friends of mine and they did not hold that
against us.” ' _ ,

Carver dismissed the possibility of the team
playing in the Liberty Bowl December 28. “Our
policy does not call for us playing in such a
game. They’d love to have us, but we won’t
go to a bowl where the team can’t get in some
good practice sessions. Philadelphia is cold in
December and we’d never be able to practice

J there or here in proper manner. Besides, there

is no enthusiasm among the boys for this trip.”
This leaves only the Cotton Bowl. Carver
says he doesn’t know whether the Panthers will
be selected if Navy loses, but admits “the selec-
tion won’t be made until after the Army-Navy
and Pitt-Penn State games are over.”
The Cadets didn’t appear in a class‘ with

_ Navy. based on the two teams, showings against

Pitt. But in this traditional rivalry the under-
dog is frequently the winner, especially when
the favorite is so highly ranked. ‘

Center Chuck Ahlborn Happy Over

 Switch From Fullback Position "

  

   



 

Rick Leeson and John Telesky made Chuck Ahlborn’-
happy he became a center when he arri
ago.

ved here three year

 

Ahlborn, a ﬁrst year dental student, wasrelcruited as a

 

/fullback, the position he played in his last two years a

Rostraver Township High School.‘ .

But, as he recalled, “About 146 , '1‘

lfullbacks .came to Pitt that year.
I came in with Leeson, Telesky
and Ray Popp (now a guard)
among others. I was switched to

 center two weeks after I arrived.”

The way Leeson and his back-
up man, Telesky, have perform-
ed the. past three. seasons, Ahl-
born feels he would have been
shoved into the background if
he had remained a fullback.

But today he is the Panthers’
starting offensive center, with one
of his prime responsibilities being
to open up holes for classmates
Leeson and Telesky.

Actually, it was when Ahlborn
became a center that enlighten-
ment struck. He discovered that
runners do need blockers."

. “After a game (in high school)
we’d always say the line did a
good job, but we didn’t necessarily
always mean it,” the 21-year-old
Ahlborn explained. “When you’re
a’ fullback or another back, you
feel you can do it on your own.
But you really can’t. However, I
didn’t really appreciate that until
I played in the line.’’

Ahlborn is now something of a
specialist, playing only on offense.
Junior Marty Schottenheimer re-
places him on defense.

Paterno said. “-'.I‘hey’re goodsized, they block

they’re just as fast.” '

In addition to being outmanned, the four
week lapse between hard games will hurt State's
performance. “In addition to that, we can only
practice" about .45 minutes’ a’ day because of
ﬁnals,” Paterno said.

“We just don’t feel we have the team that
Pitt has,” Paterno said. “They’re the best bal-

said. “Anything can happen in a football game.

“Pitt, has great passing, too,” Paterno added.
“Mazurek is fantastic. He doesn’t throw the.
ball enough. If they would have passed, they
could have beaten Army by 50 points.

“If Pittvplays the best way they know how,

Top Opponents

  Face Matmen

This Season

,By FRANK SMIZIK

Wrestling fans will get a
good look at some of the top
collegiate-Wrestlers in many
years this season at Fitzger-
ald Field House.

The'ﬁrst home meet shows
Syracuse as the Panthers’ foe.
The Orange are lead by NCAA
heavyweight champion Jim Nance.
_Terry Haise, star 123-pounder,
and Gerry Everling, 191-pounder,

"are other standouts for the de-

fending Eastern champions.

In other home meets, West
Virginia will be wrestling the
Panthers for theiﬁrst time, while
Cornell makes its ﬁrst trip here
in two years. ‘

The Panthers also face Michi-

.gan State at home. The matmen

edged the Spartans last year at

East Lansing, 16-10. ’
Lehigh wasn’t as agreeable‘ as

the Spartans last season. They

‘topped the Panthers 19-11 at their

Bethlehem’ campus. Penn State,
the ﬁnal home competition for
the Panthers, were victims last
year at a match that took place
at University Park.

The wrestlers, ﬁrst. away match
is with —Army one week after the
Syracuse meet, January 18. The
Panthers won their most decisive

‘meet of the ‘season against ‘the.

Cadets last year,’ 21-6. . , .

"Maryland was one of the Pan-
ther victims also last year, but

"this year the match is at College

Park. Michigan is the only other

edged the last year’s squad, 14-13.

The Panthers are at distinct
advantage this year as they have
only three matches away while
entertaining their opponents ‘at

_home six meets. There is also a

nine meet schedule instead of

eight like last year.

All three of the teams that de-
feated the Panthers last year are
again on the schedule and four
of the ﬁve, squads that they de-
feated are again—on ‘the agenda.
The two new additions are West
Virginia and Cornell while Iowa
State is the only team that has
been dropped. _ I '

“I don’t mind being last in the
Yogi, but I do mind being he-
‘ - hind ’Smizik,” O’Brfien said. “The
view is rathercbleak.”
I Bob “Sage” _Smizi»k, who had
the best record last, week 8-4, is
currently in a- three—way tie for
,_ fourth place with the coaches and
1" Matt Swetonic. "Although he is 11
games out of first place, Smizik
hasn’t given up hope. '_“I never
‘ give up until the ﬁnal game is
played,” he said. “Although my
sights are still set on the title,_
I’_ll have to admit that being
sports editor has detracted from
time I usually devate‘ to the Yogi.‘
I know twice as much about foot-
ball as anyone else on the staff.”
I - ,.Matt “Phathead” Swetonic, who
i is currently tied for fourth, was
‘dejected at his performance. I
“Well, I guess it’s too late to win
now, but I did beat O’Brien, and
that makes the season worth-
while,’’ ‘ I
Jean‘Kornfeld, who picked for
the girls agrees with Swetonic
that beating ‘O’Brien makes the
season worthwhile. “B e a t i n g
0’Brien makes anything worth-
while,” Miss Kornfeld said. “Even
though O’Brien can’t catch us girls
this .week, I’m sure our record
will be better than his. Even last
week, our record topped O’Brien.”
“Jug” was 6-6 last week, while
the girls went 7-5, led by Nancy
Delaney. ‘ c _
