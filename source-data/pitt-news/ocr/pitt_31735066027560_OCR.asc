‘I’ guilty or hazing

Frat members sentenced to probation, community service

Marc Nuzzo

 

The four Kappa Alpha Psi fraterni-
ty members charged with beating two
pledges last March were found guilty
of hazing and were sentenced in the
Pittsburgh Court of Common Pleas on
Tuesday morning. Each was sentenced
to probation and community service.

Timothy Jones, 21, Milton
Robinson, 23, and Damon Williams,
24, all of Philadelphia, and Eric
Coffield, 28, of Penn Hills were indict-
ed for the hazing of two pledges.

The beatings left both pledges with
kidney damage from repeated paddling
during one of the fraternity’s events.

Assistant District Attorney Eric
Fischer prosecuted the fraternity mem-
bers before Judge John A. Zottola and
a court room packed with spectators.

Three of the defendants, Coffield,
Williams, and Robinson, plead guilty
to one count of hazing. The charge, laid
out in the Pennsylvania Health and

Safety Act, is a third-degree misde-
meanor. Jones plead no contest.

Initially, the four men faced two
counts of aggravated assault, a first-
degree felony; two counts of recklessly
endangering another person, a second-
degree misdemeanor; and one count of
criminal conspiracy, a second-degree
felony. _

The trial stemmed from an incident
on the evening of Mar. 29, 1996, in an
apartment at 336 Joncaire St.

According to Fischer’s report to
the court, several members of the KAY
fraternity called the two defendants,
Santana K. Henderson and Byron
Woodson, to the apartment and
instructed them to bring several pad-
dles from a separate residence.

After arriving, the two were
instructed to go to a comer of the room
and grab their ankles, said Fischer. He
said they had been instructed to place
their left hands over their testicles as a
precaution and were then repeatedly

Student Government
sounds alarm on Trustees

The campus received an alert yesterday from the
Student Government Board describing their plan to save
student representation on Board of Trustee committees.

The SGB put out a leaﬂet called the “Campus Alert”
advising students about the upcoming decision. DalMolin
said that the leaﬂet went on on Thrusday, being dropped in
the Towers, the Union, and handed out by board members.

“We must let the Board of Trustees know that the
undergraduate population wishes to be represented on all
Trustee standing committees to express our individual and
unique concerns affecting our group,” stated SGB president
Justin DalMolin in the letter.

Board member Christa Douaihy scoured«the campus
wrangling students to sign a petition to keep their represen-
tation on the committees. Other arms of the SGB have been
petitioning, too. She had no definite figures, but estimated
that they have gathered between 500 and 1000 signatures
from the multicutural committee head’s efforts alone. As of
l0 p.m. yesterday, DalMolin estimated that there were “a
couple hundred” signatures.

This flurry of activity comes in anticipation of
Thursday’s Board of Trustees meetings when these issues
will most likely be decided.

Pitt theater department acts up for local schoolchildren

Marsha Cohen, principal of Linden Academy in Point
Breeze was enthusiastic about the performance on Feb.
6.

 

Hatch Kohlhausen/ For The Pitt News

Alas, poor Shakespeare: KenYatta Rogers’ performance as

Hamlet is considerably shorter than penned by the Bard.

The grave digger is an underground lounge singer,
Hamlet is concise, and everyone dies in the first two
minutes.

Just what sort of “Hamlet” is this?

It is “Shakespeare in the Schools,” an offspring of
Pitt’s theater department and the late Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival under the artistic direction of
Bryn Jameson. Shakespeare in the Schools and its sis-
ter, Shakespeare for Small People, bring entertainment
and the complex verse and ideas of Shakespeare to ele-
mentary, middle, and high school students.

The response has been fantastic.

“People like it. We did get a few letters. One
said,’Dear Hamlet, you’re the coolest guy I know,”’
said Jameson.

Bookings for the 45 or 80-minute performances
sold out in the middle of November. According to
Stephen Coleman, theater department chair, this
process normally continues into the middle of January
and February. Grant support has also increased from
sources such as National City Bank and the Eberly
Foundation.

The most positive response has been from the very
people Shakespeare in the Schools and Shakespeare
for Small People wish to reach —— young people.

“I think they did a wonderful job. They established
a good rapport with the children and made something
come alive that these kids may never have been
exposed to  I’d love to bring them back.”

The 45-minute elementary school version runs as
a story told by Horatio. It begins at the end and is pre-
sented in ﬂashbacks. From the action packed, sword-
frghting, emotional opening (actually the end of
“Hamlet”) to the audience participation (clapping with
the actors), the children were captivated.

Said Benjamin Smith, who portrays Polonius,
‘They get into it. Shakespeare isn’t something to just
sit quiet and watch  Kids love the ghost. They
believe.”

The actors, third year MFA students involved in
the last part of their university training, all spoke posi-
tively of their audiences. They especially loved the
younger children. David Novinski, who portrays
Laertes, said, “the older you get, the more cynical
you’re taught to be. Kids can believe. They haven’t
heard any Freudian approaches.” _

“The big question is ‘were the swords real?’ But
they also asked really intelligent questions. ‘Why did
Hamlet not kill Cladius in the prayer scene?’ ‘How did

March budget decrdline 

Cesca Anlonelli

 

Amidst confusion from faculty and
graduate students about the criteria being
used to judge departments, Faculty of Arts
and Sciences oﬁicials said they hope to meet
their March deadline for budget proposals.

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said that the
committee helping him evaluate depart-
ments and set a target number of faculty in
the school will wrap up as close to the
provost’s due date as possible.

“We’re working hard to come very
close to that deadline,” Koehler said. “I can’t
guarantee that it will come on Mar. 1, [but]
we’re working very hard to get this ﬁn-
ished” -

Kathleen DeWalt, the associate dean for
graduate studies, was more upbeat about the
chances of ﬁnishing the process on time.

“I certainly expect it to be [ﬁnished],”
DeWalt said “I would anticipate that we
have a plan for the provost.”

Provost James Maher has requested that
all schools submit their proposed budgets to
him by that date. The six advisory comrrrit—
tee members refused to comment on

whether they would meet the deadline but .

said they will have a “long meeting” on
Sunday.

Koehler convened the committee in
January, after faculty complained about the
lack of input they had put into the process of
deciding the course of the FAS and its future
size.

Department chairs from programs
being reviewed and possibly cut or eliminat-
ed along with members of the Graduate
Student Organization, one of the grad stu-
dent groups on campus, have spoken with
the committee.

Criteria for success .

Even after those meetings, program
heads, and students have wondered what cri-
teria they are being judged by and how cen-
tral to the school’s mission the FAS leader-
ship thinks these departments are.

“I can certainly understand that individ-
uals might not be aware of the kind of crite-
ria that are applied to review programs,”
DeWalt said. “I think the ways_of looking at
graduate programs and assessing them are
fairly standard. We’ve been looking at data
from a number of sources.”

Koehler detailed a wide range of criteria
the committee is using in the review, includ-
ing the quality of students that programs are
able to attract, as judged by their GRE
scores. Koehler also cited a departments
selectiveness and the fraction of the students
accepted who come to Pitt as other bench-
marks.

“We also look at the success rate of stu-
dents —— do they complete the degree they
come here for?” Koehler said. “You’ve got
to be careful with that one because you don’t

want departments to give everybody a
degree who enters, because clearly, some
don’t make the grade, and they appropriate
ly should be filtered out.” ‘

“On the other hand, if the department
has a very low success rate, it may reﬂect on
the care with which they mentor students
within the graduate years.”

The placement of students who do ﬁn-

-ish their degrees into jobs that require that
degree is a factor as well, according to
Koehler.

“A student who obtains a Ph.D. should
aspire to a professional occupation that uti-
lizes that training in some form,” he said.

The committee will also study a depart-
ment’s ﬁnancial situation.

“Overall... we’ve looked at departments
just as we do the undergraduate programs;
we look‘ at overall cost effectiveness,”
Koehler said. “For the total cost the
University invests in a department, are they
producing reasonable return in terms of mas-
ters and graduate degrees produced?”

Koehler said he understood that not all
programs could function in the black “We
doriecognizlethatnoteverydepartmentcan
be expected to stand on its own bottom, as
the saying goes.”

DeWalt added that these reallocations
are to make the FAS departments better.

“I honestly believe that we’ll be a
stronger institution,” she said. “We’re going
to see increasing improvements. I think that
we’re going to see, an improved supply of
scholarship for both faculty and graduate
students.T‘hoseareallareasthatIthinkwe

I . . ,,

The big risk

Grad students have posed concerns
about entering the job market with a degree
from an aﬂected program.

“Despite assurances that currently
emolled graduate students will be able to
complete their degrees  those same gradu-
ates will see their prospects for employment
diminished signiﬁcantly by the fact that
employers may well look on reductions  as
a vote of no conﬁdence in the degree award-
ed,” the GSO said in a letter to the commit-
tee.

Koehler said that all graduate students
take “the big risk” by seeking a Ph.D.

“I would say every graduate student
ought to worry about his or her employabil—
ity,” Koehler said. “I would think that before
I sign on for six years or whatever for a
Ph.D. in a department, I would want to know
the track record of that department.” .

When asked if category four and ﬁve
departments, the focal point of the review,
have poor track records, Koehler responded,
“Some of them are not impressive.”

Koehler would not comment on which
ones.

Centrdity to the FAS mission

The communication science and disor-
ders program, once ranked in category six
and scheduled for elimination, moved from
FAS to the School of Health and
Rehabilitation Sciences in July, 1996.
Koehler said that none of the remaining
departments will change schools.

“I don’t know of another situation like
that that I can foresee,” he said. “It was half
of a department. Our communication depart-
ment had two parts —— communication sci—'
ence and disorders and communication
rhetoric. My view of why the communica-
tion science and disorders moved is because
it wasn’t really so central to the mission of
the [FAS]. It really had more to do with a
professional training. So that was a centrali-
ty issue, not a quality issue.”

Koehler said that, though he did not
expect any other departments to move, cen-
trality is still a consideration in the review
process.

“Within those units that are staying
within the [FAS] there are some that are
much more central to the mission of the
[FAS] than others, the departments that a
[FAS] must contain. You couldn’t image a
[FAS] without those depths,” Koehler said.

Koehler emphasized the need for a dis-

THE PITT NEWS 3

tinction between what is central on the
undergraduate and graduate levels.

“For one thing, we have some depart-
ments that don’t have graduate programs
right now,” he said. “Studio arts doesn’t
have a graduate program. I think it is a very
valuable part of our undergraduate program.
Idon’tthinkthereisaneedtomakethatinto
a graduate program.” _

The GSO has argued that cutting too
many humanities programs would turn the
FAS into a professional school as well,
rather than offering a broad liberal arts edu-
cation.

Koehler said that should not be a con-
cern.
“It would be [a concern] if we were
eliminating wholesale graduate programs in
the humanities, and nobody’s proposing
that,” said Koehler.

Some graduate students have said pri-
vately that the process has placed too much
emphasis on undergraduate education and
not nearly enough on educating graduates.

“I think I disagree with that,” DeWalt
said. “The University of Pittsburgh could
not have maintained an increase, a signiﬁ-
cant investment in graduate studies here  It
is one of our priorities to maintain and fur-
ther develop as a research institution.”

Shakespeare

Ophelia drown?’ Those are good ques-
tions,” noted John Koch, Cladius.

According to Jameson, Shakespeare in
the Schools’ main goals are to bring an
appreciation of Shakespeare, give an
awareness of theater, and to teach. The
shorter scripts, compiled by Susan
Merrimam, do not seem to impair the
learning involved with “Hamlet.”

“I chose scenes that needed to be seen,
and I added narration aroundthem,” she
said.

Coleman suggested that very few tra-
ditional performances are the actual four-
hour written version of “Hamlet.”

“Anytime you cut something from a
Shakespearean play, it’s some loss, but
there is a very strong belief that most of his
plays never played at full length even dur-
ing his time, so cutting is sort of an estab-
lished tradition in the theater,” said
Coleman.

Along with a talk—back session with
the actors after the performance, teachers
do a lot of discussion in the classroom to
help students understand the play.

“We talked about how people got
along then, the whole idea of kings and
princes and families  I tried to explain to
the children that this was another time,
another place. Things were different. I
don’t want [kids] to get the idea that it is
okay for them to take a sword and do battle
with anyone,” said Cohen.

Michelle Proctor, the actress playing
Ophelia, said that when she prepares for the
role, she tries to think about what students

 

FROM PAGE I

  .=....r..<..r.r+....../r=. 

will remember about her performance.

“I think about how I can reach these
students in this grade. How can I reach a
young black female that sees me?” she
said.

Do the students respond more to one
character than others? “Hamlet is the only
character that really speaks to the audience.
I am able to speak directly to them. They
deﬁnitely responded,” said KenYatta
Rogers, the actor playing Hamlet. “I ask,
‘Am I a coward?’ Two people said, ‘No!’

That’s what you want. That’s my dream.”

The program became the full responsi-
bility of the department after the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival closed in
1995. A position called the Director of
Outreach Education and Development was
created to replace the lost staff. Bryn
Jameson filled this position.

Coleman said ‘‘[Jameson] is a very
capable, talented person. I have complete
trust in her judgement. She’s really brought
[Shakespeare] back and developed it in a

way it had never been developed.”

The program seems to have gotten off
to a good start, though Jameson said there
may be tough times ahead.

There will be no third year MFA stu-
dents in the theater department next year, so
Jameson will have to hire local actors. This
will decrease support from the university.

“Next year will be a real transition year
 if we can swing through that, prospects
are good. Right now we’re in excellent
shape,” said Jameson.

If you build it, they will come.

In an effort to improve the overall
“quality of life” for students, Pitt ofﬁcials
recently approved a proposal for a new
athletic facility, and another is still in the
works. V

Administrators said that both are
designed to provide more places for stu-
dents to work out.

_ Pitt has already approved construction
plans for these two athletic centers, includ-
ing the $300,000 Lothrop Hall cardiovas-
cular gym built over a year—and-a-half ago.
The old Belleﬁeld Annex will also be ren-
ovated into a multi-purpose athletic facili-

ty.

A new all-purpose ﬁeld for students to
be built behind Trees Hall is still pending.
All three of the facilities are plarmed with
the goal of putting the student first, accord-
ing to Lou Fabian, co-director of intramur-
al sports.

, “It’s good to see that the administra-
tion recognized the students needs and sin-
cerely supported us,” said Fabian.

The plans for these facilities began
over two years ago when Vice Provost
Robert Pack approached Fabian with a
proposal to build new athletic centers
almost exclusively for students. Together

they decided to build several smaller, more
specialized facilities throughout campus
instead of one large, centrally located, all-
purpose facility like a “new” Trees Hall.
Pack said the decision was to make exer-
cising more accessible to the student.

“Students need a range of activities
and opportunities,” Pack said about the
proposals. “Recreational facilities are
important, but we didn’t want to make
them like we’ve done in the past.”

Fabian said the success of the workout
center at Lothrop, which was designed for
women athletes, encouraged the
University to continue building the small-
er, more specialized facilities.

Construction will begin shortly on the
new gymnasium on Belleﬁeld, at an esti-
mated cost of $400,000. Plans include vol-
leyball and basketball courts as well as an
aerobics area and small weight room. Pack
predicts its completion sometime this
September.

The proposed all—purpose ﬁeld slated
for the back of Trees Hall is part of a reno-
vation that will add an all—weather surface
playing ﬁeld for students as well as a new
Astroturf inﬁeld for the baseball team.
Both ﬁelds will have lights.

The Board of Trustees votes on the
construction of the ﬁeld this March, and if
approved, the estimated $1.5 million pro-

NAACP leader says activism
determines race climate

Al’ R Abd l h
I . u

 

Pitt students should be like “ther—
mostats” and not like “thermometers.”

On Monday night, Tim Stevens, the
president of the Pittsburgh NAACP, gave
this advice to an audience of Pitt students
in the William Pitt Union in a talk spon-
sored by the Black Action Society of the
School of Social Work

Stevens recalled being posed with the
question “Are you like a thermostat which
controls the situation or like a thermome-
ter which just actually sits there and reads
the situation you’re in?”

Stevens used this thermostat philoso-
phy to focus on a progressive agenda
which his administration has set during his
term. He said that he would like to see the
African American community as a whole
adopt this philosophy.

At the opening of the talk, Stevens
wanted to get a sense of the attitude of the
audience. They raised their hands so he
could see whether the general mood was
positive, negative, or neutral. The majori-
ty was positive followed by a few in
between, and no one responded negative-
ly.

Stevens says that African Americans
don’t have control over their political
power, economic status, or judicial rights.

Stevens went on to say but they do have

’ /’   numbers which aren’t always used.

“Look at the last election for county
commissioner. Commissioner Dawida
said that [Democrats] didn’t need the
Black vote. And now, that’s why
Allegheny county is a Republican-rim
county for the ﬁrst time in about sixty
years.”

He said that the NAACP plans to
make use of these numbers in the future to
gain a political voice for African
Americans. .

“We need to ﬁnd ways of how to
unite and not be divisive,” Stevens said.

T'herearealsoplanstoenhanceeco-
nornic opportunity for African Americans
in Pittsburgh, according to Stevens.

“One of our goals is to begin discus-
sions with the city to ensure that we have
13 to 20 contractors and that they can sur-

' vive in the market place,” said Stevens.

According to Stevens, his administra-
tion has been directly involved in the
Johnny Gammage case. Since the dis-
missal of the charges against Oﬁicer John
Vojtas, many Pittsburgh citizens have
called for a police civilian review board.
Pittsburgh’s NAACP judicial committee
has supported citizens working to obtain a
review board. ,

But Fabian said renovations on Trees

action “far in the future” and coupled its
completion with the highly-prioritized, but
not ﬁnalized, Convocation Center, which
is still in the proposal phases.

The Convocation Center will also

offer new facilities for student use, but will
cater more to the needs of the varsity sports
programs. Administrators at all lev-
els said they are excited about improving
these facilities.

“This is the best job by the administra-
tion I’ve seen in in all of my 23 years,”
Fabian said of the University’s commit-
ments toward bettering facilities.

and a few others, we’re ﬁghting for the
review board through channels of court-
room litigation and by getting signatures,”
said Stevens.

In addition work in the court room, the
NAACP is sponsoring a bus trip called “A
Journey for Johnny, A Journey for Justice.”
The bus trip will take people to Washington,
D.C. While in Washington, they will stage a
protest over the death of Johrmy Gamrnage
and the dismissal of charges brought against
Officer John Vojtas.

Stevens also discussed the concerns and
issues around bringing the 1997 NAACP
National Convention to Pittsburgh. It will be
held during the second week of July.

Another goal of the Pittsburgh Branch
of the NAACP is to build an African
American Cultural Center and Museum
within the next two years.

Stevens’ agenda and work have been
appreciated by many.

“I thank you and the NAACP for the
work you’ve done,” said Christolyn Carter,
a Pitt Student. Carter said she forsees the

convention having an impact on the com-
munity of the same magnitude as the
Million Man March.

Janera Solomon, president of Pitt’s
undergraduate Black Action Society, was
optimistic about the goals Stevens outlined
in his speech.

“I think the things I’ve heard sound like
they can be positive and I think they will,”
said Janera Solomon, president of the BAS.

Tim Stevens is a Pittsburgh native and a
University of Pittsburgh alumni. He
received his bachelors degree in political
science from Pitt and went on to earn a mas-
ters in urban and regional planning. Stevens
has been president of Pittsburgh NAACP
twice.

Acknowledged nationally for his
involvement in the African American com-
munity, a few of Stevens’ awards are inclu-
sion in the “Who’s Who Among Black
Americans,” the MVP for Political
Achievement from the Champion
Association of Pittsburgh, and the ACLU
“Civil Liberation Award.”

Trial

Wednesday, February ‘I9, 1997

beaten over the buttocks by alternating
members of the fraternity.

The next day, the two pledges
noticed blood in their urine. Henderson
was hospitalized for 17 "days and
required kidney dialysis. Woodson
received treatment for similar injuries.

The incident was reported to Pitt
officials, and KAY was suspended in
April after a University investigation.

When asked by the judge if he had
any statements, Coffield’s attorney,
Mike Foglia, said the four “went
through the same process as the vic-
tims” while pledging.

Judge Zottola responded to the
comment, saying, “That doesn’t make
it right, though. I think there are other
ways to show loyalty and comradery.”

Henderson and Woodson sat in the
back row of the courtroom, their faces
devoid of emotion and eyes focused on
the judge as the attorneys argued the
case.

Jones’ lawyer, Kevin Trower, told
the judge that he is also a member of
the KAY fraternity. He told the judge
that he was embarrassed that this

'l'I-IE P|'I"l' NEWS

“shame of stupidity” had occurred.
“We are just now getting to the
point where we say it was stupid then,
and it is stupid now,” said Thrower.
Michael B. Kalocay, Robinson’s
lawyer, stated that Robinson “regrets
the incident.”
Judge Zottola sentenced all four to

"1 year of probation, 100 days of com-

munity service, payment of restitution,
and payment for the cost of prosecu-
tion.

Hurrying out of the courtroom,
Henderson and Woodson would not
comment on the verdict.

Henderson’s father, Samuel
Milliner, walked beside his son and
said that the trial had been “emotion—
al.”

“I think hazing should be con-
demned,” said Milliner. “Incidents like
this put things into. perspective.”

The defendants would only com-
ment through their attorneys.

Kalocay said that the incident was
not as severe as it has been depicted.

He said the pledges were paddled
when they initially arrived and that

 

most of the paddling occurred sporadi-
cally throughout a four to six-hour time
frame during which a party was hosted.

Kalocay said the defendants were
hoping to use consent as a defense at
the outset of the case. ‘

He said Henderson and Woodson
voluntarily made the paddles, present-
ed them, and came to the Joncaire St.
apartment.

Instead of prosecuting them under
the ‘initial charges, Fischer said the
D.A.’s office. had the obligation to
prosecute them under the Health and
Safety Act because it is more specific
to the crime and made a conviction
much more likely.

Under that statute, Kalocay said
that consent is not a defense, so they
simply took the plea bargain offered by
the D.A.’s office.

If the four been found guilty of the
charges they were initially prosecuted
under, Fischer said they could have
faced between 22.5 and 45 years in jail.

“It’s unlikely they would have got-
ten that,” said Fischer, “but they were
looking at jail time.”

SGB

Douaihy said the SGB called an
emergency planning meeting Monday
night to decide what to do.

“We had a highly powered, intense
strategy meeting to get ready for the
proposal,” Douaihy said.

When asked, she said that they
weren’t sure what the proposal would
say, so they have drafted their petition
to keep students on the committees and
extend student representation to all of
the committees. The SGB is focusing
only on students, because they don’t
think that they can speak for the other
groups, according to DalMolin.

Currently, according to the SGB,
the undergraduates sit on only four of
eleven committees.

“We, at SGB, feel there should be a
non-CGS student on every committee,”
Douaihy said.

Douaihy went on to say that though
the Student Government committee
heads have mobilized against removing
students from the Trustees, only she and
DalMolin are working on this issue.
Brian Hart, the president of the Staff
Association Council, declined comment
on the situation because he had not
reviewed the report about whether to
keep the three groups on the Trustee
committees.

Keith McDuffie, president of the
Senate Council, said that there were
four options before the Trustees. The
first is to leave things as they are now,
with faculty, staff, and student members
on the committees as voting members.

The second option would be to

 

remove them entirely from the commit-
tee. The third option is to have the three
groups on the committees without a
vote, and thus they would still be
involved in private Trustees discus-
sions.

Finally, the Trustees could have the
three groups on the committees, but not
as members. This way, the trustees
could hold executive sessions of the
committee and exclude non—members,
according to McDufﬁe.

McDufﬁe said his main concern
was not the loss of a vote, because most
committees are composed so that two-
thirds of the members are trustees, not
students, faculty, or staff. That way the
other groups cannot outvote trustees, he

' said.

“Our vote is really the ability to
persuade and inform the Trustees,”
McDuff1e said. “I don’t want to be
restricted from access to the trustees on
the committees.”

McDufﬁe predicted that the fourth
option was probably the way the
Trustees would vote.

“I’d be willing to accept a compro-
mise,” McDufﬁe said.

While SGB told students to send
their concerns to Secretary of the Board
of Trustees Robert Dunkleman, it may
not have been enough. When The Pitt
News showed Dunkleman the “Campus
Alert” from the SGB, he said it was the
first that he had seen or heard of it.

Also, the undated alert said that
there would be a table with a petition in
the Schenley Cafe; yesterday afternoon

there was no table to be found.

“We couldn’t get our hands on a
table,” DalMolin said. “We’re going to
try and bring one [today].’’

Dunkleman confirmed that the spe-
cial committee, composed of two
trustees, Jeffry Blum and Gene
Gleason, had a report of their recom-
mendations for the Trustees. Thursday’s
meeting will be the first release of the
recommendations to the public. Other
trustees, however, have seen the report.

Dunkleman declined to say what
the report recommends, but heidid say
that some definite decision will be
made.

“It’s hard to say. I would think
there’ll probably be discussion and
some action,” Dunkleman said.

“Dunkleman told me that we’d be
happy with it,” said DalMolin. “I’ll
have to wait and see what t[he actual
resolution] is.”

The special committee met with
Keith McDuffie, Brian Hart, and the
Student Government Board about three
months ago, according to Dunkleman.
In addition, Dunkleman said he
received no requests from any students
to speak at the board meeting.

McDuff1e said that he has a place
held in the meeting to speak, but he will
only allow it if the faculty, staff, and
students might lose access to the
trustees.

DalMolin said that regardless of
how the Board of Trustees votes, he
plans to continue his petition drive
beyond this Thursday.

Books, says popular wisdom, are out. Now, it
takes some popular icon on TV like Oprah Winfrey
to sell books to the sheep—like masses of society.
Too many TV generations — didn’t social scien-
tists say this would happen? And then there’s the
intemet and the World Wide Web competing for
attention with TV screens to keep Americans from
having to bother to think seriously about much or to
concentrate on anything for longer than ﬁve sec-
onds.

Every semester, I am surprised to hear profes-
sors apologizing to students about the books they
have had to buy. Every semester, I hear students
moaning about the books they have to buy.
Personally, I ﬁnd books the most enjoyable thing I
do buy in connection with my school expenses. I
don’t know, forking over eight bucks a day for
parking isn’t exactly my idea of a mutually beneﬁ-
cial retail exchange. Personally, I’d rather pay for a
nice, conveniently-shaped and packaged book of
information than suffer through hours at the photo-
copier in the bowels of some dusty library, or
worse, receive the ill-copied and worse compiled
handouts in class. Nothing is worse than ﬁnals ﬁnd-
ing you quietly freaking out in your room, desper-
ately trying to ﬁnd that one elusive handout — you
can’t remember what it’s about but can remember
doodling a picture of the Cathedral of Learning
exploding in a million pieces on the back of it.

I even enjoyed buying my science books at
eighty and ninety bucks a pop. I didn’t much enjoy
carrying them laboriously up that dreadful little hill
in front of the Chevron Building or, for that matter,
to anywhere else on campus. Nevertheless, by the
time the semester was over, I had so much blood,
sweat, and tears invested in those arcane pages that
I couldn’t dream of coldly selling my book to some
unfeeling dealer for about a tenth of the price I paid
for it in the first place. May be if you have a photo-
graphic memory and never forget anything once
learned, you can afford to dump the book and take
the greasy dollar, but for one who "suffers the
inevitable memory deficits which come with
increasing age‘ and decreasing brain cells, I say
keep the damned book and keep those rip-off so-
called bookbuyers out of my way.

But there is something about the actual heft
and substance of a book which I ﬁnd very pleasing.
I like the look of them on my shelves, millions of
words to read and savor. I like the look of them
piled on tables and ﬂoors, information and ideas to
contemplate and inspire. True, getting them onto
my shelves and tables and ﬂoors has often been a

 

r|’s best friend

challenge, but even through ten relocations in eight
years, my books are something I have never been
tempted to leave behind me. Love me; love my
books. Any man who can’t carry fourteen cases of
books up six ﬂights of stairs need not apply. (Of
course, if he can afford to pay for somebody else to
carry them well, that is an acceptable alternative.)
Men might come, and men might go, but my books
are here forever.

Last week, I heard or read somewhere that the
first chapter of John Grisham’s newest novel is
going to be posted on the intemet. Great, I thought,
just what I want, to sit for hours in front of a com-
puter screen reading a novel. I mean, I can see sit-
ting at one’s computer and researching for papers
and columns, or getting and receiving e-mail, or
balancing one’s checkbook (I’ve heard there are
people out there who actually do compute on their
computers), but reading a novel? Come on, don’t
people know anything anymore? The enjoyment of
reading a novel, I submit, comes in large part from

the reclining position one assumes, in a comfy spot, ‘

complete with supplies. At the risk of sounding
‘70s-ish, it’s got to be the Total Reading
Experience.

So for the beneﬁt of the unread generation (that
would be whoever isn’t reading this column, but I
never allow minor details like that to stop me from
advising them), I will delineate a few basics on the
TRE. The reclining posture is very important and
must be coordinated with an adequate — that is
gentle but direct —— lighting system. I ﬁnd either a
couch or bed, amply furnished with pillows and
blankets, to be a suitable repository for my body on
such occasions. A nearby surface on which to keep
sundry supplies is also required. Supplies such as
tea and crumpets and cake, or wine and cheese and
crackers. Or Chinese food, or Indian food, or a box
of chocolates, or all of the above [Depends what
one is reading. Chances are, whatever they're eat-
ing in the book, you’ll be hungry for. If they’re not
eating in the book, it’s safe (yes, this is low tech, we
are not driving, or even talking, it is safe, I tell‘ you)
to stick to a mind-altering substance of your choice:
tobacco, prozac, gin and tonic, etc.] Anyway, com-
puters are designed for idiots, but even so, they still
don’t like crumbs and food particles being deposit-
ed in their important little places. Thus, don’t spend
your money on ﬁve hours of online time, go and
buy the damned book and READ it. Assume the
position, lie back, and enjoy. ,

More random thoughts from this over-
age college student, this time on sports:

-I recently read a story in Inside Sports
by John Feinstein about former men’s hoop
coach, Paul Evans. The writer asked the
question, “Why can’t he get another job?”
Here’s the reason: Evans was considerably
overrated as a coach from the outset and left
the program in tatters when then—AD, Oval
Jaynes, would not renew his contract at the
end of the 1993-94 season.

Evans won right away only with talent
(such as Charles Smith and Jerome Lane)
he inherited from his predecessor Roy
Chipman, and Evans’ top recruiter eventu-
ally went on to bigger and better things. You
may have heard of him — John 

On top of that, I have heard he turned
player humiliation into an art form and
tended to rim his players into the ground
(which might explain why, in his last year,
the Panthers won just one game after
January). Furthermore, he wouldn’t kiss
any alumni butt. It got to the point that he
couldn’t recruit any freshman front court
players, and if you can’t recruit, well, forget
lt.

-Speaking of basketball, I wish Coach
Ralph Willard would can the three-guard
offense he’s used since he’s been here, espe-
cially since Pitt tends to get badly out-

 

last fall that Pitt play a

‘ rebounded. I’d like to see a starting frontline

of Chad Varga, Gerald Jordan (rniscast as a
center), and Mark Blount. I realize, howev-
er, that at this time, Pitt’s strength is in its
backcourt, and you do have to go with your
strengths, not to mention the lack of depth
around the basket -— depth being critical
with Willard’s brand of ball.

-More on Pitt sports: There is only one
solution to attendance
problems at football
games: PLAY PENN
STATE! A colleague of
mine here suggested

lower-echelon sched-
ule and just worry
about winning. Nuts
— I was here when Pitt
was a top 10 team, and
the athletic department
made it clear then that
the only way to be assured admission to the
Penn State game was to buy a season tick-
et. And in 1991, the last time the two teams
played at Pitt Stadium (State won, 32-20), it
was still a sellout.

Don’t think Joe Patemo didn’t know
what he was doing when he cancelled the
series with Pitt some years ago for not going
along with the Eastem All-Sports confer-
ence he craved.

-Back to basketball, have you noticed

 

that scores have gone down, especially in
the NBA? There’s a reason for that. Players
at all levels these days spend their time try-
ing to impersonate Michael Jordan and
have forgotten how to shoot the rock from
the outside. As a result, you have a lot of
people trying to play 1-on-5 basketball, and
that’s a mismatch no coach wants to see.
Not only that, but foul-shooting has become
atrocious. There_ is no
way a basketball play-
er should ' be making
less than 75 percent at
the line.

-You may
remember last fall, I
wrote about former
Pirate Barry Bonds’
attitude and behavior,
and not his color, get-
ting him run out of
Pittsburgh. However,
after reading a 1992 interview in Playboy
(for class last fall, by the way, just so you
don’t get any ideas), I have more sympathy
for him, if not more ‘respect. Tlums out he
had a lot of shadows to get out fromunder
as a baseball player, and not just his father. I
mean, he had a lead-foot iron-glove named
Willie Howard Mays, Jr. for a godfather, not
to mention a banjo-hitting wallﬂower
named Reginald Martinez Jackson for a
cousin.

- Speaking of baseball, I don’t know
about you, but I’m looking forward to the
Pirates’ season. People complain that they
don’t know the players. That may be true -—
for now. But then again, who of the non-
baseball-junkie variety ever heard of Doug
Drabek, Bobby Bonilla, or Jeff King,

among others, before they became house- ’

hold names? Others may be concerned that
manager Jim Leyland headed South. But
remember that Gene Lamont, the man who
replaced him, won a Manager of the Year
award with the White Sox four years ago.
Another thought: Four or ﬁve years
ago, the San Diego Padres had a ﬁre sale,

similar to what the Pirates did this past olT- '

season, in which they dumped every high-
priced player save Tony Gwynn. One then-
12-year-old boy actually wanted to sue the
Padres for trading his favorite player, Gary
Sheﬂield, to the Florida Marlins. But didn’t
the Padres make the playoffs last year?
One ﬁnal thought: Sure, I’ll miss
Mario Lemieux if he retires as planned. But
he saved the Penguins, owns two rings,
came back from cancer, and got tired of
being abused by on-icegoons (remember
his “garage league” remarks?).‘ He put in a

lot of good years here, but the Pens can win _

without him.

Rick Nowlin started out his journalisrrt
career as a sportswriter

Rock: the Vote should be renamed ”Rock the Morons"

 
   

I am an avid of the
magazine The New Republic , and
last week, I was reduced to hyster-

ical fits of laughter by an article -
. that ‘appeared in the magazine

entitled “Rock the Morons.” The
title, a parody upon the name of
the Rock the Vote program, was a
humorous look at the failings of
the aforementioned organization
and the fact that tvventy-some-
things are so out of touch with pol-
itics.

Rock the Vote was founded in
1990 by Warner Bros. and Capitol
Records with the assignment of
registering more younger voters,
in the hopes that younger voters
would vote for more liberal politi-
cal candidates (both companies
were disturbed by court rulings
that the rap lyrics of some of their
artists were obscene and hoped
that their voters would turn the
political tide) Thanks to heavy (to
put it mildly) promotion by MTV
and radio stations, Rock the Vote
has been looked at respectfully as
a legitimate force in politics.

The fact is that Rock the Vote
has been a dismal failure in almost
every respect. In 1996, the turnout

of twenty-something ' voters
dropped below thirty percent, and
Rock the Vote was responsible for
registering a mere half million
new voters (considering that 91
million people voted in 1996, that
is mighty small) at ten times the
cost per voter it takes The League
of Women Voters to do the same
job. Rock the Vote, observed The
New Republic writer, has provid-
ed “a way for politically dim 24-
year-olds to party with rock stars
and for empty-headed celebrities
to gain legitimacy by pretending
they know something about poli-
tics.” ‘

Too cynical a view? I don’t
think so. The writer attended Rock
the Vote’s inaugural party and
talked with some empty-headed
celebrities and dirnwitted 24-year-
olds. The manager of one rock
group demonstrated that Rock the
Vote needed to educate its own
celebrities by remarking about the
messagehis group was sending by
appearing at the party: “Look, the
way I see it, this is a gig. Earlier
this week, we were in
Charlottesville, today it’s here.
Next it’s in Georgia. What did you
say this Rock the Vote does?” The
author was further amused when

the actor Michael DeLorenzo of
the TV show “New York
Undercover” was informed that
twenty-something voter turnout
was at record lows. “I didn’t know
that,” DeLorenzo said in surprise.
“Is that what this is about? Well, if
it’s true, we gotta get on top of it.”
Later in the evening, the author
overheard some college girls from

that “keeping up with political
affairs” is important, and just 16
percent said that they talk about
politics with their friends.

Want to test your political
knowledge? Here are ﬁve ques-
tions. If you cannot answer at least
three, you ought to consider your-
self uninformed.

Question one: Who is the

New York talking governor of
about the presi- Pennsylvania?

girl angrily replied, “It doesn’t
matter that I didn’t vote. They
shouldn’t be able to do it. I don’t
understand your point. You don’t
not matter when you don’t vote.”
America’s youth have per-
haps never before been as apathet-
ic about politics or as ill-infonned
as they are now. In 1994, a study
showed that interest in politics
among college freshmen was at an
all-time low. Just 32 percent said

 

States? Question four: Who is the
Speaker of the House of
Representatives? Question ﬁve:
How many electoral votes are
needed to elect a person presi-
dent? Check below for the
answers.

Here are the answers to the
questions: The governor of
Pennsylvania is Tom Ridge. Arlen
Specter and Rick Santorum are
our Senators. Janet Reno is the
Attorney General. Newt Gingrich

is the Speaker of the House. Two
hundred and seventy electoral
votes are needed to elect someone
president of the United States.

So, what do I think? Do I lose
sleep at night worrying about
whether or not America’s youth
gets out there and votes? Not real-
ly. I look at it this way: If people

don’t want to be informed, it’s A

21 new names with their eyes on one prize

_’Bi|l McC|oy

 

The 1997 national letter—of—intent
day marks a new era for Pitt football. Pitt
managed to land a solid recruiting class,
21 players total, despite the delayed
anival of new Pitt Head Coach Walt
Harris.

The most intriguing signee of this
year’s class is 6-foot-1, 220-pound run-
ning back Kevan Barlow. A Pittsburgh
native, Barlow was named City League
Player of the Year by the Post-Gazette
while rushing for Peabody High School
in 1996.

“We’ve seen some things with
Kevan, and he looks very exciting to all
of us,” said Harris. “It could be a story-
book story, too, if he’s able to make his
grades and be the kind of football player
that he wants to be, and we think he is 
We’re excited we found him, honestly.”

“We think he’s got a lot of talent,”
said Pitt Assistant Athletic Director for
Football Operations, Jim Earle. “He’s a
young man that we think [has] a lot of
potential  He’s a very talented athlete,
a very good athlete, a very strong young
man  He’s got a lot of natural ability.”

Perhaps the deepest pool of recruit-
ed talent this year can be found at the
position of wide receiver. Pitt signed ﬁve
outstanding young receivers this year.

“I thought where we really did well
was at wide receiver,” said Pitt
Recruiting Coordinator and Quarterback
Coach Curt Cignetti. “I think Coach

Harris’ offensive reputation probably
helped quite a bit.”

“We did improve at wide receiver,”
said Earle. “We have an exceptional
class of wide receivers coming in.”

The three receivers expected to
make signiﬁcant contributions this sea-
son are: Jermaine Brooks (5-11, 175-
pounds), Jackie Womack (5-11, 180-
pounds), and Terry Murphy (6-foot, 175-
pounds). All three are junior college
transfers.

Coach Harris thinks highly of
Brooks. “When you

recruit those
California junior
college guys at

receiver, they’ve got
a lot of experience
with catching the
ball and reading
routes. Jermaine has
got good athletic
ability, good speed,
is a good kick retum-
er, runs with the
catch well, and
catches the ball well.
We’re real excited that he’ll upgrade the
receiver position.”

Murphy impressed Coach Harris
with his intensity during his recruiting
visit.

“Terry’s a good football player.
Once again, he’s an experienced football
player. He’s the only guy who ever came
on a visit who watched ﬁlm on Saturday
afternoon from 3 [p.m.] to 5 [pm]. He

wanted to watch as much tape as he
could watch. I really think he’s a real
neat kid.”

Pitt found themselves a speed mer-
chant in Jackie Womack. Womack won
the state 100-meter dash competition in
Mississippi two years in a row.

“I really like the heck out of him,”
said Harris. “I think before it’s done he’ll
be a ﬁne football player. Obviously a
deep threat. He has the one thing you
can’t coach, and the one thing we don’t
have enough of around here. He’s got
great speed.”

The remaining
two wide receiver
recruits are: Cheo
Angel (5-10, 190)
and Bryan Knight (6-
2, 205).

“Bryan is an
interesting athlete,”
Hams said. “I proba-
bly like him as much
any recruited
receivers. As a
human being. I think
he’s a real squared-
away young man. Bryan has the ﬂexibil-
ity to possibly play both ways. too.”

The coaching staff searched for per-
sonnel to man the line-of-scrimmage.
What they found were three earth-
movers disguised as offensive linemen.
John Raymond (6-7, 320), Khiawatha
Downey (6-4, 340), and Tom Coury (6-

Not that the addition of

that Coach Cassidy-Keen has

that her program will be able to

As the number—six pick in last year’s
NFL draft, Phillips was in perfect posi-
tion for superstardom. His Rams were
improving; he was fresh off a national
championship; and his talents were carry-
ing over well into the NFL.

Then, as the Rams fell through the
NFC West ﬂoor, Phillips vanished.

Amazing numbers of violations were
reported. Phillips was at team meetings
about as often as the Rams were on
national television. Combine this with his
conduct when he did show, and he may
have been hit with ﬁnes that exceeded
$200,000.

Small change, if you’re Albert Belle.

 The standards that are
set and the expectations that
are to be lived up to are the
same every year, which is to

That is why it comes as no
surprise to hear women’s
swimming Head Coach
Marian Cassidy-Keen speak of
taking the team up a notch
when discussing the team’s
goals for the 1996-97 season.

“Improving both our Big

year are two things we’d very
much like to do,” said Cassidy—

For the past seven years, this time of
year has been hectic for Pitt men’s swim-
ming Head Coach Chuck Knoles. He could
have been found designing program covers
and T—shirts, setting up committees for the
award ceremonies, handling pool set—ups,
and choosing the foods that would be on the
menu at Trees Pool. In other words, he was
doing everything an athletic director should
be doing in preparation for hosting the Big
East Championships.

This year, however, the championships
are being held Feb.l9—23 at Rutgers’ Sonny
Werbelin Recreation Center Pool. And
Knoles doesn’t seem to mind the change of
venue.

“It’s the first time since I’ve been here
that l‘ve been relaxed going into the cham-
pionships," said Knoles, who was often
lorced to miss his team‘s workouts. “I’m
able to enjoy the swimmers more this year.”

His team also likes the idea of getting
away from home.

Men's swimmers off to Rutgers for Big East Championships

“It adds a more intense atmosphere,”
said sophomore Brett Collins. “It’s not just a
regular meet.”

From his seat on the bleachers inside
Trees, sophomore Preston Hammontree
added, “I don’t like swimming here for the
championships because it doesn’t feel like a
big meet.”

This year’s championships should feel
like a much bigger meet. For the ﬁrst time
ever, Pitt will be ﬂying to a meet other than
the NCAAS. Also, they’ll be be staying in a
hotel rather than sleeping in their own dorm
rooms.

“It’s good because staying together (in a
hotel) brings you a lot closer as a team,” said
junior Jonathan Haggerty, “There won’t be
any fire alamis, either.”

Although Syracuse is the team to beat,
Knoles admits Pitt and Miami are a toss-up
for second place. In fact, he thinks his team
has a shot to win the championship.

“But it’s going to take 51 great swims
ﬁom our 17 swimmers, and 33 great dives
from our 3 divers,” said Knoles.

Haggerty, last year’s Big East champion
in both the 100- and 200—meter butterﬂy,
agrees with his coach.

“We’re pretty set at second [place],’’ he
said, “but at a meet like this, you never

Knoles thinks that both the 200 free and
400 medley relay teams can win, too,
although he has yet to decide who will swim
on each team.

Brian Elko and Jerry Koller, both fresh-

Picture yourself a freshman diver on the
brink of competing in your first Big East
Championship. All 11 Big East teams will
be there. You know even before you take
your ﬁrst dive that the competition in this
meet will be better than any you’ve seen all
season.

Some might get overly anxious or sick
to their stomachs. Some might break down.
Some might focus too much on their events
and psyche themselves out of a good day.

Standout freshmen diver Jamie
Tomazich’s laid-back attitude won’t allow
anything to get to her at this year’s Big East
Championship at Rutgers University this
weekend.

“I’m not one to get nervous. I try not to
go into meets with expectations, except to
land on my head 10 times,” said Tomazich.

Tomazich’s calm persona can be attrib-
uted to her experience in high—pressure
meets. While in high school she competed in
Senior Nationals, the Olympic qualifying
meet, two times.

Fellow freshman backstroker Beth
Grube admits that this is the biggest meet of
her career. Grube wants top three ﬁnishes in
her two events. She knows her opponents in
the 100- and 200-meter back well and feels
conﬁdent in her chances. '

“Right now I’m seeded sixth, but I
know and have swam against most of the
girls I’ll be swimming against, so that will
help  said Grube.

The addition of Notre Dame, West
Virginia, and Rutgers has allowed the Big
East Championship meet to change venues
to Rutgers University. Before Rutgers joined
the Big East, no other team’s facilities were

capable of holding the meet. It was held here
at Pitt for the ﬁrst 13 years of the Big East.

The change in pools could be a positive
omen for Pitt. When the meet is held here,
the team still has to deal with the stresses of
school. They race, and then they have to go
back to their rooms and their roommates.
They’ lose some focus. For the trip to
Rutgers, the team is ﬂying for the ﬁrst time.
They’ll be together for the better part of ﬁve
days and will have little to no distractions.

“There is the excitement of going away.
We’ll be together for most of the meet, and
that will help us stay focused,” said sopho-
more Jen Banks.

In this meet, all regular season records
are forgotten. There are no points for going
undefeated, and just the sarrre, a winless
team isn’t in the disadvantage. It’s simple:
each team puts its top 17 swimmers and
three divers in the pool.

“Anything can happen at this meet, and
that’s what is so exciting. We can go in and
have a great meet and really surprise some
people,” said Head Coach Marian Cassidy—
Keen.

The team ﬁnished sixth last year, and it
was the lowest ﬁnish by a Pitt squad in Big
East history. Keen admits that her team was-
n’t ready for the bigger and faster Big East.

This year, the team changed the training
schedule. They had a harder regimen over
the winter break which allowed the team to
beinbettershapeinJanuary.Theteamhas
put up faster times closer to the Big East.
They are swimming their best times right
now.
“We have a lot more depth this year and
a year’s experience with this new Big East.
When we added those teams last year, no
one knew what to expect, and now we do,”
said Keen.

But, outside of a multirnillion—dollar sign-
ing bonus, Phillips isn’t making but a few
measly hundred—grand a year. NFL chari-
ties must love this guy.

Come January, his debut ﬂop-of-a-
season was over. He had a good six

months to relax, study game ﬁlm, go on |

vacation, visit sick kids in hospitals, join
the Peace Corps, or do anything else he
wanted before training camp started up.

So did he use his time wisely? No.

He took a side-trip to Omaha and got
in trouble with the law. Again. The man
who would have been a top-three draft
pick, if not for an arrest in college, went
and disordered a small midwestem city.

You might think he’d used up his Get
Out of Jail Free cards, but don’t expect
the future all-pro to miss any playing
time. New Rams Coach Dick Vermeil has
already made a public statement support-
ing the running back in his moment of cri-
SIS.

 

FROM PAGE 11

This from a coach who was supposed
to bring old—style discipline to a misbe-
having Rams team. His ﬁrst ofﬁcial act
after assembling a coaching staff is to
openly support a convicted criminal.

This isn’t the way to rebuild a fran—.
chise, even if the team’s best player is a

regular at the county courthouse.

It is becoming apparent that ﬁnes and’

probation aren’t enough for Phillips. He
needs a suspension, and not one like Tom
Osborne’s sentence at Nebraska that just
happened to end before the national
championship.

Phillips needs discipline. If Vermeil
can’t provide it, there’s a chance that law
enforcement may get its turn in the near
future.

Until then, stay clear of St. Louis
stairwells.

“We were real high on the offensive line-
men we brought in,” said Earle. “One of the
things we’re looking for is not just size, but
balance and the ability to move. We were able
to bring in some guys that display that.
They’re mobile. They’ve got some balance.
They’ve got some ability, and they’ve got
some size. That deﬁnitely is an area we feel
positively about with the class coming in.”

Raymond, at 6-7, 320, may be the best of
the three offensive linemen.

“He’s got the movement,” said Cignetti.
“He’s got the size. He’s got everything you’re
looking for. He’s just got to learn the system.
As soon as he learns the system, it looks like 
he can make an impact.”

The coaching staff stumbled into the 340-
pound behemoth, Khiawatha Downey.

“We lucked out on [Downey],” said
Coach Harris. “We kind of found out about
him very, very late. He’s a real ﬁne football
player for a guy whose as big as he is. He has
real good athletic ability and real good bal-
ance.”

The 1997 class is light on defensive talent,
but Cignetti is still pleased with the players
they attracted.

“For as late as we got started, I think
Harris would probably say we did a good job
getting the kids and putting together the class
that we did.” ,

Hams agreed. “I thought we had a solid
year of recruiting. For when we started, I
thought we had a doggone good year being
able to come out with what we have.”

Philadelphia), saw Pitt as the right choice
for her from her experience on a recruiting
trip. Apparently, Grube was just as
impressed with the swim team and coaches
as they were with her.

‘The main reason that I came here was
because of the swim team, both the coach-
es and the team members,” said Grube.
“They seemed like a
family, or at least the

me a lot of respect on a
trip here, and I appreciated that.”

Grube had given Cassidy—Keen and
the team justiﬁed reason to show her such
respect. Some of her previous accolades
include the 1996 Pennsylvania State
Championship in the 100—yard back, quali-
ﬁcation for the U.S. Senior Nationals, and
All-America honors.

Yet even greater respect may come for
reasons of a different sort. During her
senior year in high school, Grube showed
tremendous courage in coming back from a
major knee injury, a feat which she admits
is her proudest accomplishment.

“In September [of 1995], I suffered a
torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament),”
Grube said. “I got in the

very much at home dur— set even higher goals for

“Marian showed “My main goal

all season was to get my
times down -to the NCAA qualifying
mark,” said Beth. ‘The NCAA time is a

2:30.80 in the 200—back. Those times have
Grube projected to be seeded 5th and 3rd,
respectively, in her events at the upcoming
Big East Championships this weekend.

Grube displays a very mature attitude
in keeping her performance in perspective.

“I just want to swim well and do what
I’m supposed to do for the team, which is
basically to win the backstroke,” Beth com-
mented. “In the back of my mind, though,
I’ve always been trying to make NCAAS.”

As for personal interests, Grube sights
running as something that she enjoys to do
along with having fun with her teammates,
but only when time allows.

“I like to hang out with the team on
weekends, but there’s not much to do to
unwind besides swimming,” lamented
Beth. “I used to run in high school, but my
Dad was the coach, so I kind of broke away
ﬁom that. Having your dad as a coach can
be a lot pressure, at least for me. Now, my
life is just swimming.”

That’s' just fine for Cassidy—Keen and
the rest of the women’s swim team,
because so far Beth Grube is making quite
a life for herself, not to mention quite an
impact here at Pitt.
