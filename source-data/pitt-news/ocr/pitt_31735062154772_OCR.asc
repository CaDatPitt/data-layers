Announce Adjustments for Triterms

By JOANNE DOLINAIR

The various schools at the Uni-
versity have found it necessary to
make certain adjustments for the
coming trimester program.

Students in the School of En-
gineering will be required to at-
tend school for nine trimesters to
get their degree once the trimester
program is underway. p

Students who will be juniors or
seniors in September, however,
will be permitted to ﬁnish in eight
trimesters.

The‘ average load each triterm
will be 161%; credits, with the bet-
ter students carrying up to 19‘/2
credits. ROTC studen_ts taking a
commission will need to attend
.more than nine trimesters. ,

Also, students in departments
that require summer ﬁeld experi-

ence will not be able to ﬁnish in
three years, since it will be neces-
sary for them to miss one summer
trimester. 0
Requirements Available

The School of Education has re-
cently decided to enroll students
for whom appropriate courses may
be available the Spring trimester
of 1960. .

One course in professional
e d u c a t i o 11 “Introduction to
Teaching,” will deﬁnitely be of-
fered; many courses in the aca-
demic disciplines to satisfy vari-
ous education requirements will
be available, if the demand ex-
ists.

Thus some students in the school
of Education will be able to at-
tend the ﬁrst spring trimester, al-
though originally the plans did

not call for this. The School of
Education will continue to have
the eight week summer session
along with the spring trimester.
Five Year Program .
In the Spring trimesters th
school of Education will not otter
a student teaching program.

The School of Pharmacy plans
to keep in phase with the tri-
mester calendar, although more
faculty members and better fa-

_cilities are needed to carry out
a full trimester program. The
Pharmacy School will soon en-
ter a ﬁve year program, which
of course will take less time
once Pharmacy offers three tri-
mesters of work. ‘ .

The Pharmacy School will run
on two separate calendars at the

Jarrell Considers
lFuture of Carnival

“Spring. Carnival_was a great
success this year,” spoke Kent
Jarrell, “but, will there be one at
all next year?” At Monday's meet-
ing of the Student Government
Association the topic of Spring
Carnival was discussed. It was
mentioned that rumors were cir-
culating that this is the last year
for a carnival due to trimester
complications.

“The problems with trimester
can be coped with quite readily,”
said Jarrell. The major problem,
he said was finding out what stu-
dents wainted. '

Jarrell said that by the lack

“it perhaps appears that the stu-
dents don’t want Spring Carnival.
The only way that SGA can de-
termine what the student body
Wants is for the students to con-
tact their SGA representatives
and give them their ideas."
Jarrell praised Donald Bu-

Oof admissions and chairman of

the University Committee on
Scholarship.

He said the student aid funds
represent an increase of 35 per-
cent over what has been available
in past years.

The University has a;nproxi—
matcly $50,000 available for gen-
eral scholarship aid. An addi-
tional $25,000 of University
funds has been sxwci-zlly ear-
marked for grants to commuting
students needing aid. The Na-
tional Defense Act has_ provided
$25,000 in loan funds.

Adams also said that Pitt ex-
pects the largest freshman enroll-
ment since 1956. "Applications for
admission to all, our freshman
schools have increased. The great-
est increase has been in admission
application for the School of Lib-
eral Arts, where" there has been
an increase of almost 50 per cent.

Although there has been a
great increase in applications for
admission for the fall. the Uni-
versity will conlinue to consider
all applications for admission un-
til July 1.

All of the students admitted
thus far have taken the College
Board exams which are reajtiired
for admission and have liig‘-la or
better than average scores.
These students also represent a

high standing in their high
school classes. About 85 per

cent are in the top two-ﬁfths of

their graduating classes.

Adams said the largest num-
ber of applications have come
from Allegheny County.

be sold for 50 cents at the stu-

Such a magazine has long been
needed at the University,” com-
mented l'aul Schwartz, member
of the editorial board.

“Starting next September it
will be published three times an-

an outlet for a great deal more
student creative effort than has
ever been possible before."

“£I‘he staff of “Ideas and
Figures’ believes that it will per-

“He was always on the spot
ready to offer any possible as-

Jack Hardman, of the Dean of

Travel Abroad

The Oﬂiceof Cultural and
Educational E X ch an g e an-
nounces the formation of a
committee, under the chair-

9 manship of Professor ‘Jack

Kolbert of the Modern Lan-

guage Department, to develop
plans for low-cost travel abroad.

This committee is now develop-
ing plans for travel arrangements
and special tours in the summers
of 1960 which will meet the spec-
ial needs of faculty and staff, stu-

dents and alumni respectively.

The objective is to make travel of
all sorts as inexpensive as pos-
sible. ,

The offering will include simple
travel to Europe _and back, study
tours, and an orientation program.
for those who wish to prepare
themselves in advance. The gov-
erning idea in all cases is to make
the service versatile by serving as
many people as possible. while
keeping the costs at a minimum.

This announcement is made
now because of the need for
long-range planning both on the-
part — of g the committee and on
the part’ of individuals who wish

~ to avail themselves of this serv-
V ice. Although'the committee is
. not .in a position to answer spe-
ciﬁc inquiries at this time, it
would welcome signs of interest,
‘ so that it may estimate potential
demand. .
Students who might be interest-
ed in participatingin such serv-
ices in the summer of 1960 are
-urged. to contactthe Office of Cul-
tural and Educational Exchange
so that ‘they may be placed on_
the mailing list for future in-
formation.

However, each of the semesters
will last one week longer than a

Because some athletes have ‘not behaved properly’ in

p a One strong View ‘of many is that athletic scholarships
?.should be awarded only to individuals’ who have shown
- scholastic promise on the secondary school level. I
At this University, the criteria for athletic scholarships
are not the same as those. awarded for academic achieve-
‘ment. Athletes generally have been required to submit only

I Recently we have heard complaints of‘ some athletes
that they are not treated as equals by the student body and
are forced to socialize only among themselves.

V .. On the other hand, students who are not athletes often
deride this segment of the University Community as the

‘Branch Rickey, the" dynamic sportsman who has
probably contributed as much to American social
progress as to American recreation, spoke over at
the Student Union last week. The advance pub-
licity said he was going to talk H
about “Pirate Baseball, Past,
Present, and Future.” He did
Few _were disappointed,
however, for Rickey is an imagi-
native man, and what he did say
came across quite well. ‘

Baseball,‘of course, was still
his main topic, but he opened
with’ a” brief autobiographical
sketch. Born -a farmboy in south- . .. .. .  .
ern Ohio,- he never attended high-school. Never-
theless, he spent _a year at Allegheny College and
gota job as a country’ teacher.

Then, ‘after ,a short career __as a professional
ballplayer in St. Louis and New York, an unfor-
tunate attack of tuberculosis, a trip through-Michi-
gan’s “Law~School and one uneventful court ses-

the administrative regions he soon came to ‘domi- -

Although Rickey is best known as the man who
built winners in" St. Louis, Brooklyn, and possibly
Pittsburgh, his activities have not been conﬁned
solely to sports. He has been a member of the
board of trustees of three different" colleges and,
for the past twoyears, has served on the Presi-

‘Committee handles appeals made by civil em-

ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCTENCE: N0. 3

Today, ranging again into the f ascinat-ing world of soc.i:tl science, '

let ustake up t-he subject of anthropology—t.he study of man
and his origins. ”

The origin of man wasindeed a puzzle until the Frenchman,
Jean-Louis Sigafoos, discovered the skull and shinbone of
Pithecanthropus Erectus in_Java in 1891. What Sigafoos was
doing in Java is, incident.-a.lly, quite an odd little story. Sigafoos
was a Parisian horn and bred. By day one could always find
him at a sidewalk cafe, sipping barley Wat-er and ogling the
girls; each night he went to a fa.shion:1blc casino where he
gambled heavily at roulette and go—ﬁsh; in between times he
worked'on his st-:nnp collection, \'.‘hich was one of the largest
in Paris.

  

igazazaiiza»

Wlell sir, one summer Sigafoos lost his entire fortimc gimnbling
at the casino. He was seriously contemplating suicide nrlicn,
quite unexpectedly, a letter arrived from one Lotus Petal
McGinnis, a Javanese girl and an avid st-mnp -collector, with
Whom Sigufoos had been corresponding from time to time
through the intcrnationa.l stamp collectors journal._ l'ntil now
the nature of their correspomlencc, though friendly, had ‘been
strictly philatelic, but in this new letter Lot-us Petal (l(*('.~l:iJ‘t’d
that although she had never‘-laid eyes on Sig-afoos, she loved
him and wanted to marry him. She said she was cightccn _vc:n's

< old, beautiful and docile, and her father, the richest man in the

tribe, had agreed to give half his fortune to the husband of her

choice. Sigafoos, penniless and desperate, iimnediately booked _

passage for Java. .

The ﬁrst.sight~of h_is prospective bride failed to delight. Si_ga,-
foos. She was, as she said, be{u1t.iful—but only by local stand-
ards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her pointed sczxrlct teeth
and the chicken bones hanging from her cars -would be con-
sidered chic along the Champs llllysées.

But sobe1;ing as was the sight of Lotus Petal, Sig:z.foos had
an even greater disappoi-11t1nent coming when he met her f athcr.

The old entleman was as Lotus Petal claimed t-he ric.hest~ man -
g y :

. in the-tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of exchange in his
tribe was prune pits.

Signfoos took one look at the mound of prune pits Wlllcll was
his dowry, gnashed his teeth, and stoinped off into the jungle,
swearing vilely and kicking at wlnitever lay in his path. Stomp-
ing thus, swearing’ thus, kicking thus, Sigafoos kicked over a
heap of old bones vvl1ic11—-what do you know!——turned out to
be Pithecantliropus Ercctilsl .

But I disgrcss. From the brut-ish Pitlmecanthropus, man
evolved slowly upward in int.ellect~. By the Middle Paleolitliic
period man had invented the leash, which was a remarkable
technical achievement, but frankly not particularly useful until
the Mesolithic period when man invented the dog.

In the Neolithic period came the most important discovery
in the history of man—t-he discovery of agricult«ure. Why is this
so important? Because, good friends, wit-hout agricult.ui~e therg
would be no tobacco, and without tobacco there would be no
l\/larlboro, and without Marlboro you would be without the
finest ﬁlter cigarette that money can buy, and I would be with-

' out a job.

That's why.

Next Hurdles
For Panthers

By -LARRY HAGGERTY
: With an NCAA tournament
bid still a distinct possibility,
the Panther baseball nine
pmust win tomorrow’s game at
California State Teachers and

'Saturday’s encounter with

Duquesne in order to remain in

the running for the District II.‘

playoffs next month.
Coach Bobby Lewis’ exciting
mitters will take a 9-2 record

" into tomorrow’s tilt at California,

Pa. (The Jungle Cats played the
West ‘Virginia Mountaineers in
Morgantown yesterday.). Co-Cap-
tain Bill Hamilton has drawn the
starting assignment from Lewis.

_This is a rescheduled . game
since last month’s doubleheader
with Coach Andy Sepsi’s squad
‘was rained out. The California
skipper is the father of Andy
Sepsi Jr., a left halfback on John-
ny Michelosen’s Panther football
team.

Clutch Hits Lacking .

After 5 last Saturday’s dismal
batting performance against Navy,
Lewis decided to make some
changes in the J ungleiCat starting

‘lineup. “We were getting the men

in scoring position almost every
inning but just \ couldn’t get a
base‘ hit at the right moment,”
Lewis said. _
I'm dropping Ron Maser
down to seventh from the clean-

cause he is stronger defensively.
It’s so nice to have Paul sitting on
the bench when you need a pinch-
hitter since he always seems to be
able to get a piece of the ball.”

Righthander Bob Conti, who
leads the Panther twirlers in the
earned-run average department,
will pitch for the Jungle I Cats
against Duquesne this Saturday.
The game will be played at Wild-
wood at 1:30 p.m.

The Dukes of Coach Doc

Skender are led by their all-
around ﬁrst baseman-pitcher,
Don Takach. In their 11 games
to date, of which the Dukes
have won seven, Takach. has
compiled a .467 batting aver-
age, has hit four homers an
knocked in 20 runs. :.

“I know that I have a high
average but I“‘haven’t been facing
very tough pitchers. All they have
is a fastball and a curve and
nothing else,” Takach said in the
Pittsburgh Press.

_ Takach May Start

“The only tough pitchers that I
will face all year are Pitt’s Conti
and Hamilton. They really know
how to pitch, and I just hope that
they give me something‘ good to
hit or my average is "sure to drop
a good bit.” .

Skender plans to start either
Ed Kaizer or Takach on Satur-
day. The Dukes have a game
with St. Francis today and the
pitcher who goes today will not
see action against the Panthers.
Takach has a 2-1 record while
Kaizer’s chart to date is 2-2.

Saturday’s Track
Meet at Stadium

By JACK SMITH

Penn State’s track team,
fresh from a 101311-391/_» vic-
tory over Michigan State last
Saturday, will be‘ out to ex:
tend its unbeaten streak as
they meet Coach Carl Rees
trackmen (2-2), Saturday at 12:30
in the Stadium. 1

This meet will be televised over
WIIC, channel 11, as a Bicenten-
nial sports event and will_be fol-
lowed by a soccer game between
the West Berlin Al1—Stars and the
Western Pennsylvania All-Stars.

The Nittany Lions’ coach Chick
Werner expressed the opinion that
his Lions would beat the ’ Cats
even without his two-mile relay
-team and Ed Moran who ran a
4:02.l mile last week at Univer-
sity Park. . _

These ﬁve men, who accord-

ing to Rees are the Lions’ ﬁve
best. are passing up the local
meet to run on the West Coast
Friday night. “They will beat
us,” said Rees, “if our runners
perform like they did Saturday.
We’re going to "need top showing
from our four key men if we
intend to stop this team that has
literally run over its opposi-
tion.” ' '

State has some top performers
in Bob Brown and Fred Kerr even
without their best ﬁve. Brown has
run the 100—yard dash in 9.6 sec-
onds while Kerr ran third in the
lC4A indoor mile last winter
beating out the Cats’ Ron Rush.‘

The Lions also have three men
who throw the javelin over 200
feet, which is 24 feet better than
the highest Panther output.

The only Panthers to better
the Penn State standouts are
Mel Barnwe1l—quarter mile,
Bill Bannow — hurdles, Ed
