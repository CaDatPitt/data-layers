Pitt hosts forum on violence

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬂ" Writer

, Karla Cunningham believes vio-

lence has a voice.

“Violence communicates, and
tells us something about those who
are carrying out the violence,” she
said.

Cunningham, a political scien-

tist with the RAND corporation,
spoke at Pitt on Thursday, the ﬁrst
day of a two—day conference on
violent groups being held in the
University Club. At the conference,
Cunningham and other panelists
discussed international issues pre-
sented by insurgents, drug cartels,
terrorists, warlords and gangs.
Not mincing words, the orga-
nizers called it, “Violent Armed

Groups: A Global Challenge.” ’
More than 100 people attended
day one of the conference, which
is sponsored by Pitt’s Matthew B.
Ridgway Center for International

Security Studies and the U.S. Army ,

War College’s Strategic Studies In-
stitute. The agenda listed four pan-
els and a dinner address by John
Robb, who lectured on the differ-
ence between Iraqi insurgents and

those in other areas.

The second half of the confer-
ence starts today at 9 a.m. and ends
at 4 p.m. There will be two pan-
els. One will address how armed
groups are funded and another

. will discuss effective responses‘ to

threats.

The conference is free, and
open to the public with registra-
tion.

For The Pitt News

Like many professors at Pitt, Car-
negie Calian likes to write.

Calian _ teaches- at the Katz
Graduate School of Business and
published his 13th book in June, a

-leadership guide titled “The Spirit-

Driven Leader: Seven Keys to Suc-
ceeding Under Pressure.”

Along with other Pitt professors
who publish research and schol-
arly material, Calian attributes his
writing success to a passion and
interest in his subjects that goes
beyond what he can cover in the
classroom.

Although his book has only been
on the shelves for a few months,

Calian’s work is widely distributed.
Copies can be found in the Book
Center, on Amazon.com and even
in larger bookstore chains, such as
Barnes 82 Noble and _]oseph—Beth
Booksellers. Calian published this
book, along with others, through
Westminster john Knox Press,
based in Kentucky.

Other Pitt professors often
publish through the University of
Pittsburgh Press. -

According to its website,-the .

press seeks to “extend the reach
and reputation of the University
through the publication of schol-
arly, artistic, and educational books
that advance learning and knowl-
edge.”

The press also publishes books
meant to “contribute to an under-

standing of western Pennsylvania

_ and the Upper Ohio Valley region,”

according to the website.

of two to three Pitt professors every

Sticco discussed the busy lives
of professors last week and reiter-

ated how important passion is in '

the publishing business.
“I remember a certain writer

and forth from Italy‘ to Pittsburgh
in order to get the information and
imageshe needed.”

Sticco speaks regularly with
the authors she publicizes for the
Press. ’

“These. authors have got to be
passionate about what they do,”
she said. “Some books take years

Pittprofessors, staff put forward their Work in print

to complete. Without the necessary

_ drive, [the books] would never get

completed.”

And whereas the rigors of teach-
ing can make ﬁnding the time to
work on publishing projects dif-
ﬁcult, Calian said that he still ﬁnds
the passion and drive to produce
his own creative installments.

Calian is the former director of
the Pittsburgh Theological Semi-
nary and said the bulk of his re-
search experience involves the role
of religion in modern-day society.

Kathryn Haines spends her
days as a librarian in Pitt’s Center
for American Music. These days,
Haines is writing another novel.

So far, she has published two

. series of mystery novels based in

the World War II era.

Addressing insurgency

Violence< 1

Phil Williams, the director of
the Ridgway Center, helped put
together the conference in Decem-
ber 2009.

“For GSPIA students, this is
central to their interests. This
features the relationship between
global affairs and violence that
takes place in the real world,” Wil-
liams said. “We are trying to get
an understanding of what makes
these violent groups tick.”

The Ridgway Center focuses on
international security studies as
part of Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs.

Williams said the center held
another conference last year,
which focused on violence and
drug crime in Mexico, Columbia
and the Caribbean and addressed

the implications for security in
the U.S. »

One of the panels featured
Thursday called, “Violent Armed
Groups: Finances and Weapons,”
featured Keith Krause, programme
director of the Small Arms Sur-
vey; Lawrence E. Cline, associate
professor with American Military
University; and Will Reno, associ-
ate professor of political science at
Northwestern University.

Cline talked about how labeling
armed groups can be problematic
because they are often in constant
ﬂux. He also warned about armed

groups that can stay under the ra— ’

darlby staying loosely organized»
“These are groups are impor-

tant, and we aren’t paying much

attention to them,” Cline said.

Lt. Col. Troy Thomas U.S. Air
Force, special assistant to the
chairman of the joint Chiefs of
Staff, said he attended the event
to better understand violent armed
groups. _

“The topic is really ripe,”
Thomas said. “There are Very few
conflicts in the world in which vio-
lent armed groups are not a key
participant.” ’

Lt. Col. William D. Casebeer
U.S. Air Force, program manager
for the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, agreed. V

“This is the cutting edge, right
here in this room,” Casebeer said.
“There will be armed groups for
the next 100 years. This will di-
rectly inﬂuence how well we train

and equip our armed forces.” ﬂ

She said that simply remembering she
loves to write helps her maintain composure
throughout her hectic schedule.

Taking care of her young son also keeps
her busy at home, she said, so she does much
of her writing on the bus.

Calian andHaines both regard the passion
for writing as the driving factor in their lives
and the ultimate reason for their success.

Calian admitted that if it were not for his
love of sharing knowledge, it might be difficult
to ﬁnd the inspiration to ﬁnish his writing.

Sometimes professors’ publications catch
the interest of their students.

Dana Townsend, a Pitt alumna, chose to
read a few books by her professors.

“I gained an entirely new perspective
on my professors by reading their books.
It gave me a little peek inside their heads,”
she said.

Since it takes a certain amount of devotion,

thoughts to complete such projects amidst I

Reuters reported yesterday that
two U.S. tourists traveling in Greece
were caught at the Athens Interna-

human skulls. Thinking the skulls
were fake, the tourists claimed they
picked up the skulls in a souvenir

their trip. However, The Pitt News
would like to congratulate the two
heroes, who are clearly among the

Letters to the editor

In response to Steve Kaszycki’s
shameful piece, “Ground Zero
mosque should move, kindly,” I
would like to "quote a CNN tran-
script from former Solicitor Gen-
eral Ted Olson:

“When our individual rights are
taken away, when the majority de-
cides that an unpopulargroup of
individuals should be treated dif-
ferently — andthey can’t succeed
at the ballot box, because they are
unpopular because they are a mi-
nority, because they are viewed
differently by a number of people
in the populace —-, they turn to the
courts of the United States.”

Olson’s remarks were in re-
sponse to a federal judge’s deci-
sion to overturn California’s ban
on same—sex marriage. '

What’s this have to do with
the community blocks away from
Ground Zero? Everything. Muslims
are the ones in this scenario that
are being “viewed differently by a
number of people in the populace.”
Kaszycki quotes that 68 percent of
Americans and 61 percent of New
Yorkers oppose the community
center, referred toyin Kaszycki’s
headline as a “mosque.”

Even if 95 percent of Ameri-
cans oppose the project, so what!

An equally appalling number of
Americans opposed freeing the
slaves and giving women the right

' t0 V0l'.€.

Which message do we want
to send to the world — that it is
okay to head down near Ground
Zero and grab a lap dance, peep
show and a whiskey-ginger, or
that the United States of America
can have all of this plus a nearby
venue where you can play basket-

ball, learn how to cook and have

an afternoon prayer?

I am disappointed to see Steve
Kaszycki’s Sept. 15 column,
“Ground Zero Mosque should
move, kindly,” both as a new
student to the Pitt campus and

as a ﬁrst—time regular-reader of ,

The Pitt News. I am ‘an Iraq war
veteran, and while I knew no
one who perished on Sept. 11,
I do know far too many friends
and colleagues who have died on
their behalf. To the families of
the victims of those attacks this
is an emotional subject, because
to them those attacks were not

levied against this nation, but

against their families. Given the

charged emotions, their feelings
on this issue should be respect-
fully —— disregarded. We are not
talking about Ground Zero but a
run—down former Burlington Coat
Factory in a neighborhood that
has been all-but-abandoned.
The “hearts and minds” we are
so desperately trying to win are
Islamic hearts and Muslim minds.
The tragic irony is that Rauf and
his followers are Suﬁ,‘ the exact
so_rt of liberal-minded Muslim we
should be courting in order to win
avbattle that will not be fought
with soldiers, guns or bombs.

‘ Even the "Bush Administration

got that part right. Terry Jones
threatened to burn the Quran,
and thousands of miles away in
Afghanistan two people he would
have never met anyway died in
protests against the mere threat.
This sort of thinking proves the
philosophy of the extremists
correct: that Americans equate
“enemy” with “Islam.” And if the
Islamic center is moved, what will
be the fate of the not-yet—rebuilt
Catholic Church, demolished
when the towers fell? '

New art exhibits dazzle the senses

If you still think of paintings and
drawings when you hear the words
“art exhibit,” the new installations
at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
might surprise you.

Arnidstthe PCA’s six newexhibits,
there are two that make use of the
senses in unusual ways. One allows
the public to touch the pieces —
“Touch Me, Please,” by local artistic
guild Group A —- and another fea-
tures vocal recordings of Pittsburgh
locals: “Five Men, Five Women, One
Child” by Lenka Clayton.

The PCA is a nonproﬁt group that
focuses on sharing local artwork and
is “committed to the artist and the
advancement of artistic excellence in
visual arts,” Stefanie Moser, the PCA’s
assistant to the director, wrote in an
e—mail. The organizationfocuses spe-
ciﬁcally on ﬁlm, video, photography
and other digital and creative medias
and crafts, she wrote. .

“The Center is where the com-
munity can create, see, support and

G learnaboutvisualarts,”Moserwrote..

The center also offers educational
programs. '

Eric Shiner, the Milton Fine Cura-
tor of Art at the Andy Warhol Mu-
seum,juried the “Touch Me, Please”
exhibit. According to Shiner, this
particular exhibit deﬁes the usual
museum rules that prevent the public
from interacting with the artwork.

“It’s an interactive environment
first and foremost,” he said of the ex-

“Normally art groups in the city

said. “Whatthat entails is that artists
submit about two art pieces each. I

Rocks Like: A collage of color for
yourears .

Although ifs been ﬁve years since its
last full—length album, The Books has

' yet again successﬁilly combined the

yin and yang of music — pop and the
avant-garde.

Although the duo’s production
might seem bizarre — most of the
lyrics consist of samples from thrift
store cassettes accompanied by per-

cussion instruments made of children’s ’

toys —— The Books manages to create
music that captures nostalgia and re-
ﬂects something profound about the
way we live, without needing to say

much at all. s S
The ﬁrst track, “Group Autogenics
1,” introduces the album’s reappearing

new-age theme by sampling hypno-

therapy tapes. The quotes resemble
what your yoga instructor might say
atthe end of class —kind of comybut
innocently optimistic. .

The song “Beaut:iﬁrl People” uses
harmonies” based on an old Danish
hymn and is backed by a beat ﬁ'om
a 1970s French exercise video. It
is also _one of the four songs that is
sung — rather than sampled — by
Nick Zammuto. The lyrics are based
off his favorite irrational number, the
12th root oftwo, which represents the
mathematical relationship between
musical notes. Who knew math could
sound so cool? .

But members of'I‘he Books are not

just math geeks ——theyhave ahumor~
ous side too. The song “I Didn’t Know
That” has a playful funk bass and is
accompanied by a hilarious golﬁng

video that canbe found online. “A Cold.

Freezinf Night” uses cassette samples
recorded by children onthe 1990’s toy,
Talkboy, showing how outrageous kids
can be when left alone with a micro-
phone. . ’ '

“Group Autogenics II” ends the
album with a calming voice — ‘And
it feels so good, so relaxed, and so at
ease / you’re becoming the world and
everyone in it” —‘— leaving listeners a
bit more enlightened than they were
sominutes earlier. I

Part of the appeal of Inter-

was that the group delivered the

sound of the times: ethereal,

Interpol’s greatness gone

Interpol 4 7

Records to the majors for 2oo7’s “Our
Love to Admire,” however, Interpol’s dab-
bling in otherestyles and genres has been a
largely mixed bag, and on this new release
the creative decisions seem even more
puzzling. In the transition between “Try
It On” and “All Of The Ways,” for instance,
the band delves into the realm of glitch
pop for all of 40 seconds.

This incredibly mild, brief experimen-
tation occurs time and time again through-
out the album, and ultimately ends up

being one of “Interpol”’s biggest drags.
It’s as though the band was willing to get

into the swimming pool, but didn’t want
to get Wet. n .

Even more distracting is Interpol’s new-
found tendency to musically ape itself —
“Lights” is basically an extended version of

the opening track, “Success,” and “Always -

Malaise (The Man I Am)” actually goes so
far as to include a section that’s identical
to the closing minute of “Pioneer To The
Falls” on “Our Love to Admire.”

There are, however, a few scattered
moments where that old Interpol magic
manages to shine through.

Its aforementioned mimicry aside,
“Lights” is among the band’s strongest
songs in the past several years, and the
closing moments of “Barricade” —-— during
which the rest of the band melts away to
leave guitarist Daniel Kessler alone ‘— are
simply masterful.

But these instances are so ﬂeeting that

they don’t come anywhere near to salvag— I
. ing the album.

It’s fairly safe to assume at this juncture
that Interpol won’t be releasing another
LP that reaches the heights of “Turn on
the Bright Lights.”

With a steady streak of diminishing
returns for the last eight years, the band is

beginning to transform into the M. Night -

Shyamalan of indie rock. I

Cuba finds early success on the field

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Before every game, Ashley Cuba sits
in her place in the locker room beside
teammate Emily Peters. She remains
quiet, listening to a song that Peters
chose for her. Her teammates know
not to speak to her.

“I’m really mean [before games],
actually,” Cuba said with a laugh.

Before she leaves the locker room,
she does a _special handshake with
Peters —— who she calls her go-to
person — then the sophomore soc-
cer star steps out on the ﬁeld, where
she’s already climbed to sixth place on
the Pit women’s soccer all-time goal
scoringlist.

Cuba didn’t expect to ﬁnd so much
success this early in her Pitt career.

“I didn’teventhinkIwouldplay, re-
ally,” Cuba said. “But it’s justabonus. I
want to play and I wantto win. I don’t
carewho scores as longaswe win.”

Head coach Sue—Moy Chin de-
scribed Cuba as a “gamer.”

“She tends to thrive in the game
situation,” Chin said. “She’s not your
most polished player, but she just has
a knack for scoring goals.” '

Chin said that when her assistant
coach saw Cuba play in high school,

Big East teams

‘Donnie Tasser
Staﬂ" Writer

Well, it was another rough one for the

Big East — two arrests, serious inju-

ries and a level of play that is closer-to
dreadful than not. Seriously, the “Big
Leas’t.”is3-6 againstFBS opponents —
wins against cupcakes Akron, Florida
International and Marshall — and

. every marquee game has failed to live
. up to_its expectations. This weekhas a

couple pivotal games scheduled, espe-
cially in the race between the Big East

, andACCoverwhichisth_eworstofthe

BCS conferences. ,
To startmy pessimistic colurrm, we
shall review the power rankings.
West Virginia — WVU, and espe-
cially quarterbackGeno Srnith,showed
gritand poise inits comebackwin over
Marshall in the Friends of Coal Bowl

— but what on earthwere they doing
losing the whole game to Marshall?
Top comerback Brandon Hogan was
suspended after getting arrested for
a DUI, weakening the teams second-
ary and providing more distractions.
WVU retains the top spot, but barely.

Saturday will give us a better handle

on exactly how goodthis Mountaineer

that South Florida could not try and

and a team that is good at home. Now
close your eyes andjust imagine that I
picked this game right and typed the
ﬁnal score here.

Maryland at West Virginia — The
Mountaineers will test their mettle
against atough Terps team in aﬁm ri-

vahy game. Maryland comes into the

game having already matched their
season win total from a year ago and
WVU comes in fresh off a comeback
win over Marshall. These ﬁrst two
games are big ones in the debate over
whether the ACC or Big East is the
worst of the BCS conferences.
Connecticut at Temple —— Will the

real UConn please stand up‘? I know_

the Huskies have played two teams at
opposite ends of the spectrum — one
good and one bad — but consistency
has always been aproblem. Iftheywant
to be aBigEastcontender, they haveto
have alights-out performance. I think
they’llwin, but it mightbe closerthan
you think. Huskies running back]or—
danTodmanwillface a goodtestinan
Owl’s defensive unit that has allowed

just 91 yards rushing.

Louisville at Oregon State — The
Cards have to travel across the coun-
try just to get burned by the Rogers
brothers, James and Jacquizz. They
play wide receiver and running back,
respectively, and lead a high-powered
Beavers offense. The Cards can ‘play
withallthe heartinthe world, butl see
Oregon State putting up almost 40 and

' winning comfortably.

Maine at Syracuse — Just what
the Orange need right now, acupcake.
Theywillwinthisweek and next, enter-
ing conference play with a 3-1 record,
but that might be the lastwinthey get
this season.

Like I said, this is a make—or-break
week for the Big East. If they get
through this week 4-1 with big wins
over Maryland and NC State, then the
conference is in much better shape
than this pessimistic column argues.
