the Student
Boards

Members of
Government
Governmental Relations
Committee travelled to
Washington, D.C., for two days
last week to help focus legisla-
tors’ attention on some of the
issues which most affect college
students.

GRC Chair Dave Kushner said
the committee concentrated on
lobbying lawmakers to increase
the reach of the National Service
program and vote against further
cuts to the Perkins Loan pro-
gram.

“The National Service program
is in five geographic regions
around the country right now,”
Kushner said. “We let legislators
know that five regions is not
enough. We need to expand the
program to every state, maybe
two places per state.”

Kushner said the committee
also pushed for expanded duties
by workers in the National
Service.

“The National Service Corps
has been involved in work like
sweeping up after floods,” he
said. "We want to see them also
perform duties which will bene-
fit them in the future.”

He said he would like to see
students getting experience with
health services, YMCAS and
working with low—income fami-
lies and welfare legal clinics

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Activists from six states will be
in Pittsburgh today to help give
Mt. Graham international atten-
tion, according to local Mt.
Graham Coalition leader Josh
Knauer.

Knauer said approximately 100
demonstrators from the eastern
United States will take part in
music, speeches and other events
as part of the Mt. Graham
International Day of Action.

Mt. Graham, Ariz., is the site of
a proposed telescope site in
which Pitt and several other uni-
versities are considering invest-
ment.

Environmentalists are con-
cerned because the site is home
to several endangered species
and is considered sacred by some

Knauer, who led a group of
demonstrators in sleeping out on
the Cathedral Lawn last night to
kick off the day of protest, called
potential investment in the tele-
scope a bad deal.

“[Our] focus is to say that we
will not allow Pitt to invest $315

Knauer said Pitt is one of 70
locations worldwide which will
host Mt. Graham protests today.

“People around the world are
trying to send the message out to
legislators and the public that we
cannot allow this travesty to
occur,” Knauer sa_id.

Knauer said the day of protest
comes at the right time, since sev-
eral other schools considering
investment in the Mt. Graham
project will likely be making their
decision soon.

According to Knauer, two other
potential investors, Michigan State
University and the University of
Toronto, will likely decide by
June whether they will invest in
the Arizona telescope project.

The university has formed a spe-
cial committee to respond to stu-
dents’ concerns and complaints
about how the fight and crowd dis-
turbance were handled that result-
ed in the arrest of six Pitt students
on Friday night, according to Pitt
officials.

“There will be an investigation,”
said Gary Moses, Pitt’s assistant
director of public safety.

The committee will seek to get all
sides of the story and prepare a
report for Pitt Chancellor]. Dennis
O’Connor, according to Executive
Director of Public Affairs Leon
Haley.

Haley said the committee of six
or seven individuals investigating
the situation will talk to Pittsburgh
police, campus police and
observers to “find out what went
on.” He said he hopes the commit-
tee can finish and report to the
chancellor in seven to 10 days.

Haley said he and Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon will be members
of the committee, but that other
representatives will not be definite
until Tuesday morning. .

Coordinator strives to

raise assault awareness
By Mark Gordon

Staff Writer

Sexual assault is one issue that gets buried under the
bureaucracy of a big university like Pitt.

To combat this delicate issue, Pitt has created the
position of sexual assault coordinator and hired Mary
Koch Ruiz away from a similar position at the University
of Florida.

“One of my goals has been to establish a program
from the ground up,” Ruiz said after arriving at Pitt.

Pitt administrators who will be working with Ruiz
speak highly of her.

“She was clearly the top choice, [and] we’re privileged
to have her join the university,” said Dennis Donham,
assistant vice chancellor for student affairs.

“lShel has a lot of experience in this field,” added Bob
Gallagher, director of the Counseling Center.

Arriving a little more than a month ago, Ruiz has
already begun a major task, the formation of a sexual
peer education group. The group will enable concerned

tration know [how we feell,”

Knauer said.

According to Knauer,
University of Arizona adminis-
trators have been “strongly
pushing Pitt to become
involved” ‘in Mt. Graham invest-
ment.

Joe Hazelbaker, an eastern
field organizer for the Mt.
Graham Coalition from Ohio
State University, said potential
investment in Mt. Graham can-
not take place if environmental
laws are to be upheld.

“This sets a horrible prece-
dent for our environmental laws
if we allow this project to go
through,” Hazelbaker said. “If

we can’t enforce what we
already have, how are we going
to protect what's out there?”

According to Hazelbaker,
there are 18 species of plants
and animals found only on Mt.
Graham.

He said the survival of three
endangered species - the
Mexican spotted owl, the
Apache trout and the Mt.
Graham red squirrel — depends
on whether the telescope is
built.

Hazelbaker also said he ques-
tions the ethics behind universi-
ties’ interest in the Mt. Graham
telescope project.

“Mt. Graham is a symbol for
ecological andcultural integrity,

and that’s why we’re fighting for
it,” he said.

“Why are these institutions of
higher learning, which are sup-
posed to stand for a higher level
of morals and ethics, involved
in a project that is so disgrace-
ful?”

Today at 11 a.m., Pitt profes-
sor Dennis Brutus will address
activists about Pitt’s potential
Mt. Graham investment. The
local alternative-rock band
Rusted Root will perform on the
Cathedral Lawn later in the
afternoon.

A mock wedding between Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
and University of Arizona
President Manuel Pacheco will

also take place today.

Knauer said the “wedding”
will allow protestors to air their
concerns in a light-hearted, cre-
ative way without losing sight of
the issues which concern them.

“The real intent behind all this
is to let the people know this is
a real issue, and we’re trying to
reach out to the community in
as many creative and non-vio-
lent ways as possible,” Knauer
said.

“This is absolutely non—violent
civil disobedience,” he added.
“We’re not planning any events
or anything that would be a
threat to the university comrnu-
nity, since we’re all part of this
community together.”

Pittsburgh police would not release any
information regarding the incident on Pitt’s
campus.Friday’s fight broke out at a dance
for high school students sponsored by Pitt’s
Upward Bound program at the William Pitt
Union. Campus police broke up the fight

and evacuated students into Schenley Quad
and surrounding areas, mixing high school
and Pitt students together.

Problems began when “unnecessary
force” was used and racial slurs made by
police while trying to disperse the crowd,
according to Pitt sophomore Nobella

Many students who witnessed the distur-

Pitt’s National Society of Black Engineers.

students to help victims of sexu-
al assault.

In addition to undertaking the
project of the peer program,
Ruiz said she would like “to
develop a university-wide poli-
cy for sexual assault.

“It would be great if each
department had a protocol with
a checklist [so] each student
could get the best help.”

Ruiz’s ability to help and com-
municate with students is a big
reason why Pitt chose her for
the position.

Communication skills are
especially important, because
according to Donhani, “[Ruiz’sl
job is to help educate the
university community and
more specifically, assist the vic-
tims.”

Helping victims of sexual
assault is something Ruiz has
gotten a lot of practice at. After
receiving her niaster’s in guid-
ance and counseling from the
University of Wisconsin, she
became a mental health coun-
selor. In charge of two counties
and being the only female on

' the staff, Ruiz said she had all

kinds of cases pass through her
door. “I received all the incest
cases, and I worked in ages
from a 2 year old to a 60-year-
old woman,” said Ruiz.

 

Attention journalism and magazine students:
The Pitt News is looking for feature and news
writers. If you have to write an article for a
class you should have it published and earn
money for it as well. Call Christine at 648-7983
for more information.

After that stint of counseling,
Ruiz joined the staff at St.
Norbert College, where she was
the only female counselor in the
89-year history of the college.
She then moved on to the
University of Florida, where one
of her mainduties was to coor-
dinate all the peer counseling
sessions. ‘

She has already begun the
task of getting herself acquaint-
ed with the university communi-
ty by meeting with the Office of
Residence Life and resident
directors for the residence halls.
In the future, she said she plans
to meet with “the people from
the Greek system.”

Concerning a fraternity poster
that Pitt’s Campus Women’s
Organization considered
degrading toward women, Ruiz
said, “I think the [Interfraternity
Council’s] guidelines need to be
more strictly enforced.”

One factor behind Ruiz’s suc-
cess at her job is her empathy,
she said.

“I think I am empathetic. If I
was sympathetic, I would not be
as effective. I work toward an
understanding,” she said.

Ruiz, who said she is glad to
get away from the scorching hot
summers in Florida, is married
with three sons and lives in a
suburb of Pittsburgh.

Student involvement leey to success

With the arrival of Mary Koch Ruiz from the
University of Florida as the first sexual assault coordi-
nator for Pitt, students have a chance to not only get
involved, but help make the environment of the
University of Pittsburgh a better place. As part of her
position, Ruiz is looking to develop a program to cre-
ate peer educators.

“The role of a peer educator is to help prevent further
sexual victimization on campus,” said Ruiz. The peer
education program is also supposed to allow con-
cerned students to help victims of sexual assault.

The peer program, which is designed by Ruiz to be
“students helping students,” is an excellent way for stu-
dents to combat misconceptions about this issue which
is often too delicate for people to approach. Ruiz
hopes to create an “awareness of the dynamics of date
and acquaintance rape.” These are crimes which often
happen and go unreported because of a lack of under-
standing about what they are. However, this program
will have the positive effect of letting students know
not only that this is a serious problem, but what
avenues there are to deal with them.

“One of my goals has been to establish a program
from the ground up,” Ruiz said. The Pitt administrators
who have worked with her have lauded her and her
qualifications. Since they are glad to have her, they
should give her the support she needs and listen to her
recommendations. Her experience lends credence to

_ what she says, but this will all be for naught if she

doesn’t get the resources and funding she needs to get
her programs working.

One recommendation which she made that should be
enacted is the development of a university-wide policy
on sexual assault. Students have to know that their
rights, will be protected, and having guidelines in place
will llet them know what to guard against and will
improve the atmosphere for all.

But there is another important aspect to her work,
and that is student reaction. Students are one of the
most important resources that are available to this pro-
gram, and they can become a very useful resource for
other students, if they give it their support. The stu-
dents at the University of Pittsburgh should volunteer
and attend the programs which she plans to imple-
ment. Ruiz said that she needs at least 50 students for
the peer program.

Ideally, more should come forward and volunteer for
this effort. While it would be possible to run with 50
students, having more than enough reliable people will
make the program even more successful. It is the stu-
dents she must truly reach, as it is they who must deal
with these delicate issues and make the campus a more
livable environment.

Russian people need helping hand

When the CIA uncovered a S_oviet mole
recently, a debate was ignited in Congress and
throughout the country over whether the United
States should continue to give foreign aid to
Russia. President Clinton and the State
Department say that it is in the interests of the
United States to continue to provide monetary
handouts. Others in Congress have argued that
aid should stop. Clinton and his foreign
“experts” have deluded themselves, and are
attempting to delude the American people, into
thinking that Russia and Yeltsin are our new
best friends. That is just nonsense. I have a deep
respect for the Russian people, but to believe
that the Russian government under Boris Yeltsin
is heading toward a democracy is just foolhardy.

I believe that there are two main reasons why
the United States should stop giv-

troops are involved in several civil wars in for-
mer Soviet republics and has threatened to block
any attempt by Eastern European nations to join
NATO.

What makes all of this rhetoric particularly
unnerving is that Russia is now in the midst of
an internal struggle. Yeltsin and the parliament
are on opposite sides of the, pplitical spectrum,
as the release of the October 1993 coup leaders
clearly shows. It is evident to nearly everyone
except Clinton that Yeltsin has been turning
increasingly toward authoritarian rule.

Russia’s reforms are all but dead with the gov-
ernment printing rubles around the clock and
Yeltsin making a move for dictatorial powers, so
why send them foreign aid? There are enough
people on welfare in this country, and it is

absurd to export our failed wel-

ing Russia foreign aid. The first is
that the money will do little to
help the Russian economy and
nothing whatsoever to help the
Russian people. Secondly, the
Yeltsin regime cannot be trusted.

fare program overseas and pre-
tend that our charity will solve
Russia’s problems. The fact is
that the United States cannot
help Russia until Russia helps
itself. To do so they must do

The American people should not
hand over money to Russia under the auspices
of it being used to help their economy when we
have no idea at all what most of that money is
being used for. One thing that is clear, though,
is that some of that money is being used to pay
off American traitors to spy for Russia as the
Ames case has shown. 0

Russia has a history of over 1,000 years of
being ruled by an authoritarian government and
several hundred years of being an imperial
power; they aren’t about to change now. Russia
clearly wants to re-establish a sphere of influ-
ence over both the former republics of the
Soviet Union, which it calls the Near Abroad,
and the Eastern European nations. Russian

what China has done so suc-
cessfully since 1979, stabilize the political situa-
tion and attract foreign investment. Until Russia
gets its government straightened out, all of the
handouts in the world will do nothing but line
the pockets of politicians. The Russian people
are well—educated and hardworking and they
deserve a better government than they currently
have. Instead of kissing up to Yeltsin, Clinton
must face reality and realize that what the
Russian people need is not a handout but a
helping hand. Clinton can’t get rid of Russia’s
incompetent government, but the United States
doesn’t have to subsidize imperialist aspirations.

Letter to the Editor

As you may well imagine, this has been an
extremely busy few days for me. There is so
much that I need to get done.

But nothing is so important that it would pre-
vent me from taking just a few minutes out from
all the phone calls and meetings to write this
short note of introduction to the student body,
faculty and staff here at Pitt.

I feel very privileged to be your head basket-
ball coach. And make no mistake, this is your
team. As your new head coach, I am dedicating
myself to running a program that will be suc-
cessful and will represent the entire university
community in a manner consistent with Pitt’s
high ideals. I

I said in my news conference that I felt that no
otherpprogram in the country right now could

~~-or--»-v.‘...'—...-A ,1"... ,,c..._.,.....

have greater potential. We can’t achieve this
potential alone. We need your help. You have
supported Pitt basketball in the past. We need
this support to continue and even grow, espe-
cially from the students, if we are to strive for
higher aspirations.I can promise you this.
Basketball will be fun at Pitt. We’ll be a running
team; We’ll be a pressing team; We’ll be using
the three-point shot as a real weapon. There
won’t be too many dull moments.

As things settle down a bit, I’m looking for-
ward to meeting as many of you as I can. I've
always stressed the concept of family. Our team
is a family. Thank you for welcoming me to your
University of Pittsburgh family.

Blair, Warner sbmef

By Keith Pompey
Stajf Writer

This past weekend, senior
hurdler Kim Blair spearheaded
a successful Pitt charge at the
Miami Gatorade Track and Field
Invitational.

Blair did it all.

“She qualified in the 100
meter hurdles, broke the record
in the intermediate hurdles and
was also on the 4x100 [relayl
that took second place,” Pitt
head coach Steve Lewis said.

Saying that Blair broke Tasha
Whitted’s 1992 record is an
understatement.

She outright smashed it.

Her NCAA—qualifying time of
59.60 seconds demolished
Whitted’s old record (1:01.36)
by nearly two seconds.

Although Blair said she is
happy with the results, she feels
that she could have run faster
under different circumstances.

“I could’ve run better than I
did,” Blair said. “The sun kind
of drained me. I didn’t run my
fastest time. Coming from 50
degree [weather in Pittsburgh]
to 80 degree weather is a big
difference.

Razorbacks Win first national
Championship ever, beat Duke

Thurman buries Blue Devils with rain—making three

By Keith Pompey
Staff writer

With time running out in yes-
terday’s NCAA Tournament
final, Duke was faced with pre-
venting the Razorbacks from
doing what they do best — fir-
ing up the threes.

But as fate would have it the
Blue Devils failed.

With one second left on the
shot clock and the game tied
70-70, Arkansas’s Scotty
Thurman fired in a high-arcing
shot over a diving Antonio Lang
that will forever be remembered
in the state of Arkansas.

“I saw time running down, I
felt like somebody had to come
up inside,” Thurman said.
“Dwight Steward bumped me
over. I tried to alter the shot and
hopefully it would go in.”

It didn’t just go in. The
sophomore’s shot gave the

University of Arkansas its first .

national championship.

As the final seconds ticked off
the clock, the Razorbacks had
defeated the Duke Blue Devils
by a score of 76-72.

Arkansas head coach Nolan
Richardson said that Thurman
was the difference in the game.

“Duke is a great basketball
team,” Richardson said. “Of
course [Duke coach] Mike
[Kryzewskil does a heck of a
job. We could never put them
away and they could never put
us away. They had a ten-point

run on us and we turned that
around. When l Thurman l let
go a long three, I said, ‘Hey, we
could probably win this now.”’

Richardson was right about
the teams not putting each other
away.

It was a game of nine lead
changes and 12 ties.

A game in which Duke had a
13-4 run. Then Arkansas
answered with 21-6 run.

It was a game in which Corey
Beck, who averages just five
shots a game, came up big by

College
Basketball

Game

scoring 17 points.

“He doesn’t score many
points, but that tells you what a
heart can do for you,” Corliss
Williams, the tourney MVP, said
about his teammate. “Corey is
the head of this team. Without
him, sometimes we are lost. He
was in the game for us and you
can see what happens when he
is in the game for us.”

It wasn’t just the offensive
power of Arkansas that won the
title. Due to their “40 Minutes of
Hell” defense, Duke was held to
shooting a dismal 59 percent

from the field.

The Blue Devil that suffered
the most was Grant Hill.

Hill, who came into the game
averaging 17 points, was held to
just 12.

But Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski said that Hill’s per-
formance was not a factor in the
outcome.

“It was a great college basket-
ball game,” Krzyzewski said. “I
don’t think you can fault any-
body. There were a lot of great
plays by special kids tonight,
and I am disappointed that we
lost, but I want to congratulate
the Arkansas kids. I thought we
played really good defense.
Scotty Thurman hit a great shot
right at the end of the clock. I
thought that both teams played
well and one team executed
better than the other.

“I’m proud of our kids and I
know Nolan has to be proud of
his. We put ourselves in a posi-
tion to win and we just didn’t. I
am very proud of my team.”

Krzyzewski also did not feel
that the “40 Minutes of Hell”
was a factor.

“I think they just wear you
down,” he said. “We got emo-
tional. They were not going to
quit. They are too good of a
basketball team. We tried to
keep ourselves fresh. They got
the lead and we came back.
They got a chance of kind of
blowing and our kids came
back.”

tired.”

Allison Williams also bettered
the old mark with a time of
1:00.71, giving the Panthers 21
one-two sweep.

Williams and Blair also
teamed up in the controversial
100 meter hurdles.

While it looked evident to
everyone at Greentree Track
that Williams had indeed won
the race, the victory was award-
ed to Syracuse’s Keri Hinderlie.

The officials said that
Hinderlie barely nipped
Williams at the tape. Hinderlie’s
time was 15.65 to Williams
13.66. Blair captured third with
a time of 13.76.

“It was controversial.
Everybody except her team-
mates thought I won the race,”
Williams said. “But I just have to
use that as fuel and incentive to
work to get myself in better
shape so the next time I run
against her, it will be an outright
defeat.

“It will not be a question of
who won. It will be obvious
who won. Everybody will know
that I beat her.

“As soon as we crossed the
line and they said the unofficial
winner is Keri Hinderlie, every-

World champion Blue Jays still slated for top of AL East

Under the 1994 realignment,
the 1995 Yankees would have
gone to the playoffs as the wild-
card team — the non-division
winner with the best record.

Chances are that the
American League East will be
the first AL division to feature
two ball clubs in the new—era
playoffs. It is the best division in
baseball. So strong that the
back—to—back World Series
champion Blue Jays are in a
tougher position to repeat this
year than a year ago, when it
had to win the division.
Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, New
York"and~o’foronto all open 1994
fielding clubs capable of play-
ing deep into October.

Toronto Blue Jays

The Jays have answered a lot
of ques_t_ipns in the last few
weeks, _~= to everyone’s sur-
prise they stayed in—house to do
it.

Rookie catcher-of—the-future
Carlos Delgado won the left
field job with his awesome bat,
and because center fielder
Devon White covers so much
ground he’ll be able to make up
for a lot of Delgado’s outfield
inexperience. Fellow 20-year-
old rookie phenom Alex
Gonzalez used his strong spring
at the plate to carry his brilliant
but youthfully erratic glove at
short into the Jays’ infield.

Right fielder Joe Carter broke
his right thumb on March 23
and was expected to be out for
four to eight weeks. He was
back playing a week later. Todd
“Stoppermyre” will be the Jays’
closer until Duane Ward (bicep
tendinitis) returns from the 15-
day DL. Stottlemyre will set up
when Ward comes back,
because rookie left—hander Paul
Spoljaric joins Juan Guzman,
Dave Stewart, Pat Hentgen and
Al Leiter in a stable rotation.

The Toronto offense, with
White leading off followed by
Robby Alomar, Paul Molitor,
Carter, John Olerud and Ed
Sprague, is a strong balance of
average, speed and power. The
defense is anchored by White
and second baseman Alomar,
both the best in baseball at their
positions.

If the Jays end up needing to
go outside for help this season
Pat Gillick, who is in his last
year as Jays’ GM, has the money

and the guts to do it. He’ll get
manager Cito Gaston the play-
ers he needs to win. Gillick
always does. And these Jays will
win the East. They always do.

New York Yankees

The Yankees are a good solid
team. They’re not spectacular,
but the additions of Terry
Mulholland and Xavier
Hernandez and the return of
Luis Polonia filled the Yankees’
remaining holes.

Mulholland shores up a rota-
tion dominated by left-handers.
Jimmy Key is the ace and would
have won 22 games last year
had the bullpen not let him
down. Jim Abbott has always
had the stuff to win 20, but this
year he’s healthy and he’s got
the drive to do it.

Hernandez jumps into the
bullpen-by-committee with RHP
Bob Wickman and LHP Steve
Howe. It’s a capable trio, but
look for either Wickman or
Hernandez to assert themselves
early.

Polonia is the speedy lead—off
hitter that the Yanks needed.

manager and a meddlesome
“Boss” could mean disaster.

A strong start is the key,
because if the Yanks are win-
ning, Steinbrenner will be less
inclined to take the hands-on
role he has in the past. The
Yankees’ solid all-around play
and the usual fast stait from Key
should get them off to a good
start. The pitching should also
help New York avoid any pro-
longed losing streaks on their
way to winning 92 to 96 games.

Baltimore Orioles

Baltimore is the popular pick
in the East this year and for
good reason. They’ve got a dev-
astating lineup two Cy Young

candidates (Mike Mussina and
Ben McDonald) and the all-time

saves leader (Lee Smith).

But being the favorite puts
pressure on the Orioles to win.
They spent $45 million to get
this club into the playoffs this
year. The Mets and Dodgers
have tried to win this way in the
past and failed. The Orioles
need a good start to prove to
themselves and their fans that
the money was well spent.

slow starter in the past and any

The pads are crashing at Pitt
Stadium as the Panthers are in
the midst of their spring prac-
tice season, which officially
began on March 22 and will
conclude with the playing of
the Blue-Gold game on
Saturday, April 16.

Spring football is a concept
that can be confusing even to
college football fans, let alone
people not as familiar with
the sport. What exactly is
spring football?

Spring football is not a tac—
tic to remind the athletes that
they are on a football te_a_n_i
between January and August.

Spring football is not an
activity for the coaches and
players to participate in and
give all who are involved
something to do during the
spring academic term.

Spring football is not a
chance for the media to cover
something between the end
of college basketball season
and the beginning of baseball

learning and using the system.

“Our goals are to build on
our positive attitude, become
even more disciplined, more

season.
-So, again, what exactly is aggressive, develop greater
spring football? leadership and improve the

quality of our football team all
around,” Majors said.

0 What does it mean from
the players ’poz'nt of view?

The drills are a chance for
the team to get better condi~
tioned and more intense, and

According to Pitt’s coach,
johnny Majors, spring football
is a combination of condition-
ing drills, scrimmages and
practices. It is also a chance
for the players to become
more refined and better at

The NCAA limits Johnny Majors’ time with his players.

they give the coaches and
players something to think
about this summer and head-
ing into preseason camp.

“Spring ball gives the
coaches a good chance to
develop some preseason
depth charts which will help
when mapping out the strate—
gy for summer football
camp,” junior offensive line-
man Rick Cardinali said.

body in the stands started
booing. Everybody felt I won.
I felt I won. I knew it was
close, but when they put out
the official results there is
nothing you can do about it.
You just have to use it to train
harder.”

In the field events, Pitt’s
Joanne Warner was unstop-
pable.

In the discus throw, Warner
killed the competition with a
throw of 141 feet, six inches.
Syracuse’s Nicole Jackson was
the closest to herp at 105- 2.

Warner had a similar result
in the javelin, crushing the
"competition by more than 33
feet. Her best throw was 138-
6. Jennifer Williams of Pitt fin-
ished third with a throw of
102-11.

In the shot put, Warner suf-
fered her only defeat as she
took fouith with a put of 39-
8.75.

Even though the Pittsburgh
native qualified for the NCAA
championship in the discus
and javelin, she is still not sat-
isfied with her performance.

“lPeopleI look at the result

and see that I won,” Warner
said. “That doesn’t mean
nothing. The competition
wasn’t there. I didn't do any-
thing special.”

The Lady Panthers also
fared well in other events.
Natasha Van Reil took fifth in
the 800 meters (2:16.97).

In the 1,500 meter run, first-
year performer Angie Martin
took fourth (4:-40.95) and
sophomore Tonia Malloy took
fifth (4:45.35).

Pitt’s 4x100 relay team took
second with a time of 47.62
seconds.

-And how much practice is _

allowed according to the NCAA?

The rules governing the
spring drills are stringent and
extremely well-defined by the
NCAA.

Only 15 practice sessions are
allowed during a 29-calendar-
day period with a limit of only
20 hours per week of drills.

“The 29-day period begins on
a date determined by the
respective institution and does
not include holidays, official
school days-off or snow days,
which is possible in schools like
Pittsburgh,” NCAA legislative
committee member Steve

11

Mallonee said.

“Also, only 10 of the 15 prac-
tice sessions can be full contact
in full gear. The other practice
sessions may include ‘light’
gear, such as helmets, but not
full gear.”

After the conclusion of the
spring practice season, the ath-
letes have the summer to them-
selves to study, for those who
are taking summer classes. The
usual, officially voluntary, off-
season regimen for team mem-
bers includes weight—lifting,
running and other conditioning
drills. Players are not allowed to
be supervised by the coaching
staff during the off-season.
