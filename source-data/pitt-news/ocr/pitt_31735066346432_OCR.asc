Officers Deny
Alleged Red °
Tricked Group

By BARRY GROSS

Officers of the Inquiry Club to-
day denied statements made by
their advisor that alleged Com-
munist Daniel Rubin had tricked
them when arranging to speak
before the club.

Mary Jane Soloman, president
of the Inquiry Club, explained
that she and Charles Marches, the
Club's program director, had con-
tacted Rubin and asked him to
give the club his views on the
controversial l\/IcCarran Act.

The officers would not say when
or where they met with Rubin.

Miss Soloman emphasized that
Rubin had not made the initial
Contact by writing and asking to

speak before the group, as their

advisor, Dr: Hugh Cleland, had
told the Pitt News.
Knew of Background

According to the club’s presi-
dent, she, Marches, and some of
the other members had seen Ru-
bin’s monthly newspaper, “New
Horizons for Youth,” contrary to
Clelandsstatements of last week
and were aware of R.ubin’s back-
ground and of the lines his speech
would and did follow.

“It was a controversial sub-
ject and we knew Rubin’s
views would arouse healthy
controversy,” Marches said. The
club, he continued, “is interest-
ed in

jects. As long as someone will
defend his viewpoint, we defend
his right to speak.”

But in a second interview, Cle-
land contradicted the
statement that they had known of
Rubin’s background.,He said he

 Lack
Of Senate Co-operation

Sobota is a leader deserving
stated Pat Teeters, vice presi-

dent of SG, at the Senate meeting Monday.

Miss Teeters discussed in general the apparent non-
function of the executive branch this term, and the lack

of co—operation and co-ordinati
cussion with a warning to theo
Senate that the low attendance atl
meetings is following past trends.§

a

Miss Teeters said that the Sen-
ate is doing the work for both;
ends of Student Government, and;
that the only part of the execu—§
tive branch of SG now function-
ing is the recording secretary and
the treasurer.

Has Speciﬁc Duties

Commenting on the situation,
Bernard Adams, advise to SG,
said, “It strikes me that SG is
too widely complex an organiza-
tion for Sobota to know exactly
what he is supposed to do.”

Adams said that there are
many overlapping areas in the

Student Government operations

that must be looked into quickly

and carefully.

“The executive does have spe-
ciﬁc duties. Jay Fingeret, vice
president, pro-tem, said, “There
has been no attempt to carry
these out.” Fingeret cited the
public relations committee as one
area of the executive branch that
was not functioning.

In answer to this situation, the
senators each gave suggestions to
President Sobota which could
start the executive branch of the
government to be again a func-
tioning part of the organization.

Suggest Improvement

The suggestions included more
speciﬁc reports between the ex-
ecutive committee and the senate,
so that all the senators would be-
aware of the projects of the ex-
ecutive committee.

It was also suggested that So-
bota have a meeting with the ex-
eeutive committee and fill all
Vacancies, and inform all the
committee members of the exact

fold purpose of the new otﬁce is
to “improve the administration of
our programs and to give respon-
sive and responsible service to
the students of the University.”
“We will use the new room,”

K continued Johnson, “to better our

communications with the student
body. _

“We act in response to what the
students feel, and the main trou-
ble has been that they don’t ex-
press their discontent.”

Not Just a Mouthpiece

“Council has been seeking the
student‘s discontent with ques-
tionnaires and we feel that the
office will give us another means

of getting to’ the students.”

“We‘are going to ask‘ them to
come in and tell us what they
think and want."

Men’s Council is, however, ac-
cording to Johnson, “rm: just a
mouthpiece.”

“The problems of the student
body require responsible deci-
sions and we have been at-
tempting to draw in people who
are able and willing to assist in
their solution."

Johnson added that “the faculty
and administration really want to
know the problems of the stu-
dents" and that the Council can
wield a greater inﬂuence with
“the definite opinion of the stu-
dent body behind it."

“The fruits of our labor come
out of administrative decisions,”
he said.

“Unfortunately,”
Johnson, “the students
realize that things
done for them.

“We deal mostly with intan-
gibles, and it is regrettable that
we are getting knockedxfor not
doing anything.”

“Orientation will, however, still
continue to be our greatest inter-
est because there is a great value
in getting the freshmen off on
the right foot.”

Rubin Rlmbarb

Q
The confusion resulting from Daniel Rubin’s perform"-

ance at the Inquiry_Club two weeks ago centers in three.

major areas and illustrates the very real threat posed by
the offhand presentation of speakers of varying viewpoints
Without proper introduction.

The degrees of secrecy apparent in the speaker, Rubin,

I the advisor, Dr. Hugh Cleland, and members‘ of the Inquiry

Club cannot be dismissed, so easily, for they show the pit-
falls open to the ‘uninformed.

In the ﬁrst place, Rubin’s method of operation not only
on this campus but at other universities leaves him highly
suspect as to his purpose of addressing studInts.iJust one
week after his appearance at Pitt, Rubin showed up at
Ohio State University under only slightly more suspicious
circumstances.

“I According to Steve Gussler, managing editor of The

Lantern, Ohio’s student newspaper, the school has ‘a rul-
ing that no speaker can be brought to campus without

the approval of the sponsoring club’s advisor. To cir-

cumvent such an action, Rubin. appeared in the school’s
Student Union. officially unannounced but unofficially
heralded by certain students, Gussler said. Then to a fairly

large crowd he held an informal discussion on “civil liber-

ties” for two and a half hours. Since he had made no of-
ﬁcial speech, no charges could be brought against Rubin,
but Ohio oﬁicials did order an investigation to determine
once and for all his connections with the communist party.
Nevertheless, Rubin did make his address and presented
the ideas he wanted to get across to many of his followers
in any but an outright manner. "

In the second place, Dr. Cleland as spokesman for the

‘Inquiry Club has presented one side of the problem

claiming misrepresentation and _tri'ckery on the part of
Rubin.

 The Inquiry Club on the other hand, maintains that it
‘was aware of Rubin’s background and denies any trickery
on Rubin’s part. But officers refuse to give any details such
as when and ‘where Rubin was contacted. Those facts, they
stated,‘ are “unimportant.” Another thing the club obviously
considers unimportant was presenting the facts’ of Rubin’s
background to his audience. In the case of most organiza-
tions on campus, The Pitt News is contacted and given
background releases on most of the major speakersplanned
on campus. This has been true of the Inquiry Club in -the
past, but no notice reached this oﬁice on Rubin. If the whole
thing was so unimportant, why was there any bother at all‘?

It is situations like the one stated above that points
out the dangers involved in the issue of controversial speak-
ers on campus. If the purpose of Daniel Rubin’s speech was
to arouse “healthy controversy,” then why the shroud of
mystery and intrigue portrayed by all sides involved?

The U.S. government is not afraid to state what it be-
lieves and why. At the Associated Collegiate Press Conven-
tion this past week, Daniel Loach, director of the Federal
Bureau ofclnvestigation, explained his committee’s stand
on Daniel Rubin. As an investigatory, or fact finding agency,
Loach said that the committee placed Daniel Rubin on tile
with all evidence designating him as a member of the com-

munist party and that he is the director of the communist '
_ party youth group for the United States. Loach went on to

say that in most cases anyone investigated by the FBI.
pleads guilty because the FBI. does not make accusations
without facts. He pointed out Ethel and Julius Rosenberg,
Klaus Fuchs and Gus Hall."

Yet the healthy inquirers defend Rubin’s right to the
Fifth Amendment maintaining that they realize “the possi-
ble legal and economic recriminatiofis that might befall
him were he to admit that allegation.” Naturally, under
the McCarran Act, which hejis ﬁghting, the alleged com-

lmunist Rubin could be breaking the law, for the Act re-

quires any member of the communist party to register with
the government. Nevertheless, the inquirers uphold the
rights of Rubin to openly ﬂaunt the decision of the Supreme
Court because of the consequences involved even though
J. Edgar Hoover, head of the F.B.I. has called Rubin one
of the two most upcoming members of the communi.st
party--a party, by, the way, whose tenets call for violent
ovbt“lf°hi"'ow of the U.S. government.

True, every man has the right to speak, be he cannot
cloud what he has to say with mysterious actions and cir-
cumstances. If he does, then it‘iS"up to the sponsoring group
to present any clarifying facts it can’. There should be no
fear‘, of repercussions in a democracy.“

consideration for the sale of al-
cohol is the Student Union, which
seems to be holding its own
without the added attraction of
alcohol. *

In the’ years that the dry
campus law has been in effect,
there have been few incidents and . .
accidents caused by students un-

’der the inﬂuence of‘ alcohol on this campus. They

have been infrequent, and for the most part, rela-
tively minor. If this motion is approved, there
will be major changes in the campus social life
in one of two directions.
Attractive Offer

Fraternities will have something a little more
attractive to offer candidates who are considering

‘ going Greek. Elimination of the expense of trans-

portation and parties off campus will give the fra-
ternities more money to redecorate theiriold, some-
what run—down houses: After the parties people
will not have far to drive to get back to the campus
area, lessening the chances oflautomobile accidents

after an evening of drinking. The, tone of the"-

parties will not be on the present plane of “see
how muchyou can drink” because alcohol will be
easily available whenever the student wants it.

Big Problem, Little Problem] ..

I Advice From AStranger

By Ina Amdur

In almost every newspaper in this country
there is a pernicious and tragic-comic feature call-
ed advice to the lovelorn: Letters appear every day,

written byipeople in some kind of trouble, ad-‘

dressed to the all-knowing» wise journalist who
with a ..wave of his magic pen
sends his soul-saving platitudes
to his readers.

If we discount the number of
letters which are written as
jokes, then we are still left with
a sizeable number of sincere
letters written in the hope of
ﬁnding some kindpof solace. That
such a column should appear in
newspapers with adult circula-
tion is unforgivable.

It is really possible that the ,
letter-writer and the columnist truly believe that
two total strangers can write to one another and
communicate anything meaningful? It would seem
obvious to a high school freshman that problems
involving human relationships are of such com-
plexity that not only can they not be solved by
strangers,“ but all too often cannot be solved by
the people concerned. If the people who were hav-

ing difﬁculty didttry to solve their own problems, it

would necessitate some painful honesty, the most
difficult of all traits. It is so much easier to follow
the “life made easy” school, and write letters to
newspapers, signing them with the comforting
anonymitypof “C. L.” or “discouraged.”
Glib Journalists

However, the fault does not lie half so much
with the people who write the letters as with the
glib journalists who answer them. The people can
be forgiven. because the terrible loneliness of the
troubled makes any attempt at communication, no
matter how superficial it is, understandable. It is

Letters to the Editor must
carry the complete name and

If possible, they should be

The fraternity houses, being in a resident’

position of backing student drinking, becauseqa‘
change of policy indicates approval. Many peoplg
gaining this new alcoholic freedom are under'2

to help. Were he to realize the immensity of this
task, and the impossibility of its fulﬁllment, he
would turn to honest work, where he has no chance
ofruining people’s lives. Some will protest that the
problem is not so serious, that no one really heeds
the columnist’s advice anyway. In the contrary,
anyone who ﬁnds‘himself in azdesperate enough
situation to warrant writing to a perfect stranger,
will undoubtedly follow the advice once it is ‘given.
The Least Bit

Were the columnist the least bit cognizant of
what was going on behind the scenes, he would
certainly be faced with a loss of his equilibrium.
Nathanael West, in a book called Miss Lonelyhearts
presents just such a columnist who realizes that
all letters which he receives are “stamped from
the dough of suffering with a heart—sha_ped knife.”
One letter quoted by West is worthy of being
Partially reprinted here. “I am sixteen years old
and I don’t know what to do . . . When I was a little
girl it was not so bad because I got used to kids
in the block making fun of me, but now I would
like to have boy friends like the other girls and go
out on Saturday nights, but no one will take me
out because I wasborn without a nose.”

Each letterlcomes from the heart ofia suﬁ"cring
human being. Yetxthc columnist continues writing
his glib messages to the world of men. and never

as if there is much rclationshipxamong these phe-
nomena, the same insensitivity to human suﬂ"'cring

Sociologist, Speaks
On Government

Dr. Philip M. Hauser, Professor

of Sociology and Director of the
Population Research Training
Center of the University of Chi-

Changes on Local Government.”

The lecture, to be given Thurs-
day at 8 p.m. in the SF. audi-
torium, is the Seventh Annual

Goes Out of Way

“There are times, I admit when
I go above and beyond the call of
duty to,‘ help someone, but I have
found that they always send a
note of thanks ‘when they have
wanted something out of the ordi-
nary,” she said. .

Mrs. Pickering believes that
she was somewhat handicapped
this year in giving the telephone
numbers of students living off
campus because there were very
few telephone numbers listed
on the registration cards, and
no University student phone
book has been published.

Mrs. Pickering said that if she
has gained nothing else in her
five years as a source of inform-
tion, she has learned a lot of tele-
phone numbers, and the entire
layout of the University.

Revised Statement

Cleland revised his statement

about the oﬁicers’ knowledge of

Rubin’s newspaper and their
manner of contacting him.
“In talking to the officers

after I Spoke to the Pitt News,

I found that they had seen the ,
- paper. Since Rubin came from

out of town, I assumed he had

written the club.”

When reminded that he had
previously told the Pitt News he
had seen the letter which the of-
ﬁcrs say doesn’t exist, Cleland
replied, “If you say that’s what I
said, then that’.s what I said.”

. Dr. Cleland explained his posi-
tion: “Before the meeting, I had
not seen a copy of Rubin’s news-
paper and did not know of Ru-
bin’s affiliation with the Progres-
sive Youth Organizing Commit-
tee or his alleged affiliation with
the. Communist Party. After lis-
tening to him and reading his
paper, I feel more strongly than
ever, that he deliberately mis-
represents himself.

the main question is his right to

hear his views or any other views.

what Rubin said and the ques-

The controversy began on Oc-

meeting. Mimeographed sheets
identifying him as director of the
Communist Party‘s national youth
group were distributed anonym-

“It Goes On..."

OH, HENRY

Jack Henry is an inch, perhaps two, under five and a half feet,
slightly built, and as he advances toward you with a slight stoop of
the shoulders, head forward, and a ﬁxed-from-under stare he
makes you think of a charging bull. His voice is deep, loud, and he
does the color segment of the radio broadcasts of the Pitt football
games. I  ,

He was in the radio booth in Miami, Florida, when the torrential
rains fell which were seen across the nation on television. The gale
blew with the strength of a hurricane in fitful bursts that boomed
like salvos of great guns ﬁring over the ocean. The rain slanted in
sheets that ﬂicked and subsided. A gust seemed to blow Henry away.
The air was full of ﬂying water. “ l

The wind ruffled the wisps of graying hair around his washed-
out eyes. He gnawed his cold lips, and shook, showing his uneven
teeth in a smile because of the hilarity of it all. He swallowed a
mouthful of water, and for the first time in his life, he was tongue-tied.

For Jack is a great talker, perhaps, even the greatest. He is the
funniest story-teller you’ll ever /come across, and one of the most
well-read. He conducts quiz games during the airplane ﬂights and
amuses the players with true tales such as the one about the soldier
who was given the Purple Heart for blowing up a manure-smelling
outhouse. And the players are always asking him questions on his-
tory or vocabulary.

Henry was born in Neath, Wales, a. town which claims actor
Ray Milland as its favorite son. Jack’s dad, Ralph Henry, was an
agent, booking vaudeville talent there, and later in London
where Jack grew up. In 1920 the Henrys set sail for America
and landed in New Brighton, a hamlet near Beaver Falls, Pa.,
which was busy making bath tubs when the new family arrived.

Ralph Henry’s top drawing card in America was “Gentleman
Jim” Corbett, the Irish heavyweight boxing champion, who made the
stage circuit, telling of his ring feats. Jack was an only child, and
“had an English accent that you could cut with a knife,” according
to the masterful story-teller. ,,.,_

“I used to ge the hell kicked out of me every day at school,"
Henry says. “My folks. made me wear an Eton collar, short pants,
and golf socks. Why it was the sixth grade, and I looked like a
damn Little Lord Fauntlcroy.

Spelling-Bee Buzzing

“I had all kinda trouble in that class,” he continued. “One day
the teacher asked me if I knew what a spelling-bee was, and I said
that it was probably some sort of an insect. ,That got the class in
an uproar, and when I refused to leave the game for spelling the
word honor, h-o-n-o-u-r, the kids were enraged. J

“I said that I didn’t know anything about Thanksgiving, which
is only celebrated in America, and I said that Longfellow was a sec-
ond-rater compared to Shakespeare. Shakespeare is England's man,
and you know him backwards and forwards in the English grammar
schools. I used to have to recite before my class in New Brighton,
quoting the Bard.” ‘

It is amazing that at fifty years of age, Henry can still recite
passages from Shakespeare errorlessly. ‘When I didn’t know
anything about the War of 1812 which was a. mere diversion from
the Napoleonic Wars for England, the class was up in arms. They
thought that I was belittling America, and they» cried, ‘oh you
won’t admit that we beat the hell outta you, huh!’

“And with that they sent me ﬂying in the sand. Every day we
marched out of class to the music of a victrola and then they dis-
sembled and kicked my head in.” i \

Henry began writing sports for the Beaver Falls Tribune as a
sophomore in high school, did publicity work for Geneva College to
pay his tare through school, and after spells with the United Press
and covering the brothel beat of Water Street for a Steubenville
newspaper, he wound up at the Sun-Telegraph.

Managed Boxers

He had worked short periods as a promoter and a boxing manager
in between, but stayed 14 years at the new defunct downtown daily,
before shifting to radio announcing. -

Somewhere along the line, Henry did a stint in the armed forces.
He along with Vic Wertz and Pat Mullen, two major league baseball
players, were the only ones in the camp that weren’t theatrical people.

 

Two of the notorious stagefolk that the company had to con-
tend with were Mickey Rooney and Bobby Breen (Henry boasts
that he was bigger than Rooney). “We were so fed up with these
two,” Henry heckles, “that we actually worked out a trade with
another company for two fellas that they wanted to get rid of
as bad.

“Rooney first breezed into camp on a Monday,” Henry recalls,
“and he invited us to his wedding the next Friday. He married a Miss
Raese, a 5-ft, 10-in. beauty.” She was not Rooney’s last mate, how-
ever, as he carried on a ﬁerce duel with Tommy Manville in the
race to the justice of the peace.

“My kids still aren't satisﬁed with me, though,” Henry asserted.

dent went to Harvard.’ One day my boy met me at the busstop, and
told me, ‘Dad, the kids say you’re pretty small. Are you?’

“I told him yeh, that I am little. Then he says, ‘in fact, they say

Booters Limping Lately

Lock Haven Next

By LEN BERENFIELD

The injury-plagued Panther booters host Lock Haven at
Kennard Field Saturday in an effort to get back on the win-
ning track after. their recent defeat at the hands of West
Chester. The Lock Haven squad will be seeking revenge for
the 3-2 defeat the Panthers handed them last year.

This year, the visitors come here with an impressive

record of six victories as against‘
only three defeats. They have
downed Millersville State College,
R. P. L, Sﬁsquehanna University
Trenton State,  -
and Lycoming.
Frostburg also
fell before Lock
Haven, while in
an encounter
earlier this
year, Frost-
burg held the
Cats to a 1-1
tie. Another
common oppo-
nent, is Slippery Rock. Pitt de-
feated Slippery Rock 4-0, while
Lock Haven was handed a 2-1
setback.

Lock Haven hasseveral out-
standing players who will be do-
ing their best to ruin the Panther
hopes for victory on Saturday.
William Johnson, an outside right

wing, is noted for his speed, and
should draw special attention
from Pitt defense. Goalie Habern
Freeman and center half Gene
Koehler should also cause the Pitt
team considerable trouble.

Injuries have been causing the
Panthers a great deal of conster-
nation, lately. Bob “Corky” Cuth-
bert, the team’s leading scorer,
will definitely be out of action
Saturday as a result of last week’s
encounter with West Chester. He
reinjured his knee. Nick Bares,
fwho also suffered an injury last
week, is a doubtful starter, as are
Hannington Okoth and Alberto
,Sichel, both of whom were in-
ljured earlier this year.

The loss of Cuthbert will great-
ly hamper the Pitt attack, for of
the seventeen goals which the
Panthers have scored this year,
fBob has tallied twelve.

BOB SMIZIK
Sports Writer

Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish will be out to break two
three—game losing streaks when they face the Panthers at
the Stadium this Saturday. Not only have the Irish dropped
their last three games after winning their ﬁrstthree but they
have also been unsuccessful in their last three outings against

the Panthers. -

among the nation’s top ﬁve teams
on the basis of their fine early sea-
son showing. A loss to powerful
Michigan State did not damage
the reputation of the Irish too
greatly but successive losses to
Northwestern and Navy have
dimmed the Irish. glow quite a bit.

The Irish will be out to regain
their national ranking at the ex-
pense of the Panthers although it
would take a convincing “victory

-over the lowly rated Cats to im-

press the pollsters.

Dabiero Sparkles
Sparking the attack for the
South Benders is halfback Angelo
Dabiero, a Donora Pa. native.
Although he weighs in at only 105
pounds Dabiero has the speed and
shiftiness to have earned an 8.1
yard rushing average prior to the
Navy game. A
Joining Dabiero to form pos-
sibly the smallest halfback com-
bination in the country is 170
pound George Sefcik. Making
up for the lack of bulk at half-
back is perhaps the biggest half-
back in the nation in 230 pound
reserve, Paul Costa.
Handling the chores at quarter-
back is Daryle Lamonica, a do
everything type of back. He leads

0
l
Notre Dame had been rankedljn

rushing, tiedtfor the lead in scor-
g and is the squad’s number one
punter. ‘
Lind Hammers Line

Mike Lind, who hammers at the
line for a 5.8 yard rushing aver-
age is the starting fullback. He is
ably backed up by Paul Snowden
a bruising 240 pound fullback.
With Snowden and "Costa in the
lineup the Irish backfield no doubt
gives the line a battle for weight
honors. -

As is evidenced by the out-
standing rushing statistics, the
Irish prefer to earn their yard-
age over the ground rather than
through the air. In their first
ﬁve games they attempted only
43 passes, completing 16 for 190
yards.

On the ground the Iri'sh’s great
offense begins to show. They have
picked up 1,415 yards via the over-

land route for close to a 5 yard

average.

The Panther backs will run into
a tough defense’ that is bulworked
by guard, co-captains Norb Roy
and Nick Buoniconti.

If the Panthers can revert to
their former trait of stinginess to
opposing ball carriers, that they
seemed to have lost during the
Syracuse encounter, they could go
a long way towards stymying the

Waslo Excelled in ‘61;
Squad Was Mediocre

By GERRY MAZO

After his cross-country
squad had nipped New York
University last Saturday, 27-
28, Coach Carl Rees remark-
ed that the ﬁrst and second

place times were probably
among the best ever compiled in
a Pitt home meet in the past ﬁve
years.

Upon checking the records, Rees
discovered that

dividual win-

Waslo Quick
In addition: Waslo’s mile, two-
mile, and three-mile clockings of
4:51, 10:11, and 15:56 proved to be
the quickest times for those dis-
tances over the entire course dur-
ing the 1957-—l96l span.

The steady performance of the
dependable sophomore, who was
the leading‘ Pitt runner in every A
encounter, was the lone bright
spot in an otherwise dismal sea-
son for the Panther thin-clads,
who posted a mediocre ledger of
3-5.

In the 1961 lid-lifter, the Rees-
men were swamped by Slippery
Rock. They next proceeded to even
their record at 2-2 ‘when they
dropped a 32-34 squeaker to Ohio
U., but downed both Bowling
Green and host Kent State in the
same quadrangular contest. Pitt’s
dual-meet losing streak still con-
tinued, nevertheless, as they were
solidly trounced by Penn State and
also topped by Navy.

After that, the Cats fell victim
to West Virginia's Mounties, 25-30.

Although he is not one to alibi,

freshmen grid coach Bill Kali-
den feels that his charges could
have compiled a better record
than the 2—2 slate they ﬁnished
the season with if they had had
more time to practice their own
plays.
"Unfortunately, the freshmen’s
first duty is to the varsity and
they spent much of their practice
time working the plays of the
varsity’s upcoming opponents.

Kaliden points out that, "the
only time we had an opportunity
to get in some good practice time
was before the West Virginia
game and that was our ‘best per-
formance. The weeks before the
Penn State and Navy games we
spent most of out time on the
varsity practice ﬁeld.

“Although we beat West Vir-
ginia and lost to Penn State the
fact that West Virginia easily beat
Penn State leads me to believe
we might have beat them {Penn

classes, which they lacked last

year and depth in the lower and

Jeﬁ‘ Ware, who has gained some
renown on the football field of
late, has a virtual lock on the
starting berth in the heavyweight
class as he is the team’s only
member in that division. How-
ever, he could be challenged by
a 191 pounder.

Silverman who ﬁnished second

these divisions.

Ken. Barr appears to have a
good shot at the number one po-
sition in the 177 bracket and Tom
Jeffries, who has the ability to
become one of the squad’s top
men, should give added strength
to the 177 pound and 191 pound

six solo tackles. Rick Leeson and
Lou Slaby, two bone-crushing .
fullbacks who double at corner
linebacker‘, each recorded ﬁve
stops. Hzizlfback John Yaccino, the
top Pitt back in the game, stopped
six ‘runs and safety-man Glenn
Lehner wrestled ﬁve more runners
to the ground. ‘
When one considers that Paul
Martha and Pete Billey, both
deep men in the defensive unit,
were next with three tackles, it
is obvious that the line wasn't
holding. Tackles Bob Guzik and
Ernie Borglietti are both ex-
pected to be ready for the Irish
after sitting out some games’
with injuries, and this may
bolster the line play.
Off.ensive.ly, "Pitts ground game
gained 110 yards less than the
winners and their aerial game
was nine yards better, but the
Cats still only completed four of
six passes, a good pei"cen.tage_. but
not enough tries.

Telesky Tough

Sophomores Billey and John
Telesky showed good power in
-bulldozing through the Orange
line, and John Yaccino came to
life in the first half, squirming for
good yardage and turning the ends
effectively for the first time this
year.
I Incidentally, Ed Clark complet-
ed two passes for 31 yards-——he’s
now six.-for-six throwing from his
halfback slot. Paul Martha
couldn’t stand up in the goo.

Law Manual Iublished

The University Health Law Cen-
ter has published a Canadian sup-

plement to their Hospital Law

Manual.

The Manual arranges hospital
statutes, judicial decisions, and ad-
ministrative regulations for ready
reference by attorneys and hos-

pital administrators. It consists of

two loose-leaf volumes.

Nathan Hershey, assistant re-
search professor of health law at
the ‘University, commented upon
the project.

“Although there Is 3 similar-
ity‘ between Canadian and Unit-
ed States law because of our mu-
tual Common Law background,
the differences in the organiza-
tion of hospital services and the
methods of payment lead. to
substantial variations’ between
the laws ofthe’ two countries on
hospital. matters.” , .

Hershey iwas primarily respon-
sible for ‘ preparing the supple-
ment. He was present on October

 
 

25 at the ,3.7.t.h meeting of the On-
tario «Hospital Association in To-
ronto’. At that meeting, John F.
Horty, director of the Health Law
Center of the University Graduate
School of Public Health, discuss-ed
the significance of the new sup-
plement as a legal service for Ca-
nadian hospitals.

The Ontario Hospital Associa-

tion sponsored research for the
Canadian supplement. Along with
Donald M. Stocks, an assistant re-
search professor of health law at
the University, Hershey spent nine
months on the project. They gath-
ered their material at the Univer-
sity of Toronto Faculty of Law Li-
brary and wrote the supplement
there thissummer.
Supplementary material to the

manual is mailed periodically to

subscribers. There are 1,300 sub-
scribers, including hospitals, med-
ical schools, law libraries and
health agencies.
