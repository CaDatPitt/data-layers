meeting.

Protest Vexes

BY RICH HARRY

The Black Action Society (BAS)
protest at Wednesday’s Student
Government Board (SGB) meeting
has prompted statements of con-
cern within the administration over
the conflicts thathave developed
between the SGB and other student
groups, according to Vice Chancel-
lor for Student Affairs Alfred
Moye.

Moye said yesterday the problem
has been a source of concern in his
ofﬁce for a number of weeks. “The
situation has been an ongoing
concern to the administration. . .and

. A special meeting of the
University Senate yesterday ap-
proved proposed changes in the
Senate’s by-laws which would
create a Faculty Assembly. ,

Before the proposed by-laws
change can go into effect, it must
receive approval from the Univer-
sity Senate’s 1200 members in a
special mail vote.

The Faculty Assembly would be
composed of 83 faculty members
elected from the various schools,
departments and divisions of the
University. According to the
by-laws, the faculty representa-
tives to the Senate Council would
be elected from the faculty
assembly.

night’s protest,” Moye said. “I
have been talking withymembers of
the Office of Student Affairs about
evaluating approaches I personally
could take in resolving conﬂicts
between the SGB and any student
groups expressing unhappiness

- with the Board.” -

Moye said he personally disap-
proved of the tactics BAS used
during its protest. “I personally do

not approve of confrontation»

politics of any kind,’_’ he said. “I
was very upset about them holding
people at the meeting against their
will. That really bothered me.”

Moye also questioned the inten-

tions of BAS in demonstrating at

the Board’s meeting. “The
demands were far beyond the

leaders as being detrimental to
student representation in Univer-
sity governance, since faculty
members in the University Senate
Council might vote as a bloc, thus
creating an instant majority in any
vote.

Clifford Ham, chairman of the
committee that drafted the new
by-laws, said, “The Faculty As-
sembly will help increase faculty
input into the decision making
process. In the past, there has
been no real representation of
faculty opinion.

Professor Daniel Cheever ques-
tioned the validity of the vote since
the required quorum of 100 was not
present at the meeting. Since the
call for a quorum was not made
before the vote, its outcome
remained valid, according to
Robert Newman, Senate Parlia-
mentarian.

BY RICH HARRY _

Over 150 members of the Black
Action Society (BAS) stormed a
Student Government Board (SGB)
meeting Wednesday, holding SGB
members and Student Affairs
personnel hostage during the
heated three-hour protest.

Campus police broke up the
demonstration following a brief
scufﬂe, allowing the release of Al
Bowen, coordinator of the campus
judicial system; Jack Brown,
assistant director to student activi-
ties; six Board members and
members of the Student Govern-
ment Allocations Committee; SGB
advisor Nancy Evans; and John
Rebich, chairman of the Committee
on Student Organizations. Student
Union director L.D. Sauvage stayed
at ﬁrst, but was eventually allowed
to leave the meeting.

capabilities of SGB to deal with and 

you must ask the questionof what
is really bothering these young
people.”

According to Carl Redwood,
member of the BAS steering
committee, the demonstration
showed SGB that BAS “was not to
be played with.”

“I think after Wednesday night
the SGB and administration recog-
nized we are serious about getting
action on our demands,” Redwood
said. ‘“We are now negotiating
from a position of strength, and not
one of weakness.‘

“BAS has tried to negotiate with
SGB; we were ' very nice and
followed their rules and regula-
tions. I hope Student Government
now realizes we’re serious and that
further dealings with the Board
must be serious,”. Redwood added.

In a statement yesterday, SGB
President Barry Weisband said:
“The SGB will ‘never tolerate or
condone the kind of conduct that
was displayed by the BAS
Wednesday night. We refuse to
consider unilateral demands that
do not take the interests of the
entire student body into considera-
tion.  "

/

“In fact, we will never consider
any demands. If a particular
student committee or campus
organization has a problem, it
should present the problem to the
Board without a violent threat
directed at any individual or
group.” '

Weisband continued, “The
Board is open to discuss any
student’s concern with any student
at the University of Pittsburgh just
as long as it's presented in a
reasonable and mutually respect-
able manner.”

 

BAS members, toting placards
and yelling protest chants, repor-
tedly launched their protest march
at Iothrop Residence and paraded
through the Towers, Quadrangle
and into the SGB offices in the
Student Union where they waited
to present to the Board a series of
wide-ranging demands.

Using all available space in the
SGB ofﬁces, BAS members
crammed into the three small
rooms and pressed against the
walls, stood atop chairs and tables
and continually chanted, “Black is
back, badder than before. We
won't take your shit no more,” and
“Two-for-six-eight, Pitt is a police
state.”

The Board arrived several
minutes later. Weisband’s first
words to BAS were: “Thanks for
getting involved. We’d appreciate
if it we can go on with our
meeting.” Weisband later sug-
gested the proposals be placed on
the SGB agenda under new

 

business, and further suggested_

using the Student Union Ballroom
for further discussion between the
two groups.

BAS, however, was adamant in
refusing to depart from the SGB
offices and demanded the Board
listen to a lengthy series’ of
demands BAS had earlier drawn
up. (See page 4.)

After BAS co-chairman Doug
Guy began reading a prepared
statement listing the demands,
BAS members charged the Board
with ignoring Guy and not
considering the BAS protest
serious. BAS members chanted
“How long will this bull-shit go

' on?” and several blacks individ-
ually spoke out harshly against the

Board. —

V “You wanna listen or not?’
yelled one BAS member. “If not,
we’ll stay here all night.”

Another BAS member screamed:
“You think this is a joke? This
ain’t a joke. We’re serious.”

Campus Police To Issue

State Parking Tickets

Campus police will be issuing
$25 state citations for parking
violations after Thanksgiving,
while they await a court ruling on
the new Pennsylvania Motor
Vehicle Code which prohibits
campus police from issuing parking
tickets, according to Jan Thomas of
the Campus Police.

“Flagrant abuse of the parking
system and increased pressure
from our permit holders left us with
no alternative but to issue the
citation,” Thomas said.

With the advent of the new State
Motor Vehicle Code, the Campus

Police could issue only warnings in

lieu of the $7 fines they previously
issued.

Once or‘ twice in the past few
weeks city police issued the
citations which bear a fine of $15
plus $10 cost, at the request of the
Campus Police, Thomas said.

“The city police do not have
enough manpower to handle the

Black Students Protest SGB

Attention then focused on Guy
who read the BAS demands, of
which Board members were‘subse-
quently asked their opinions. SGB
member Larry Krain was visibly
shaken by ’ the ordeal as he
addressed the protesters, and
Weisband, who remained silent for
the most part during the demon-
stration,»told BAS members, “The
demands must be and will be taken
up by SGB. The SGB has always
had time to read through the
proposals and demands of all
students in the University.

“The demands won’t be taken
up until after the seven members of
the Board read and discuss the
demands with each other and with
students of the University com-
munity,” Weisband said.

During Guy's announcements,
BAS members began to plaster the
walls‘ of the SG conference room
with the placards they carried
during their march. In unison,
BAS members read off the posters,
which included: “How did SGB
support tuition hikes? A parallel
line can be drawn between the
actions of the SGB and the Board of
Trustees decision to arbitrarily

raise tuition,”; “We are dissatis-
ﬁed with the treatment of this
year’sBlack Homecoming Queen.”

Following Guy's announce-
ments, BAS members demanded
Weisband explain the action the
Board will exercise" on the
demands. Weisband answered,
“Your demands are valid. I can
reasonably say we can have
answers to your demands by the
end of the week. It takes a lot of
time, a lot of effort on the part of
SGB...to come to some agreement
by the end of the week. We’ll try to
do the best in putting in time,
effort-—that is very sincere". We try
to do the best job we can, whether
you believe it or not.”

In their protest, BAS was joined
by the Collective for Alternative
Education (CAE) in speaking
against the Board. “We don’t
believe black students are the only
students getting shafted by SGB,”
CAE member Todd Jailer said.
“SGB is only responsible to the

Administration and in increasing

proﬁts for the Administration.” A
CAE also joined with BAS in

demanding the resignation of

Weisband. The groups erupted at
least twice with chants of “Quit,
Barry, quit. Quit, Barry, quit.”
And when Bowen urged BAS to
allow students to freely leave the
meeting, the protesters cried out:

Cuban Economy      

Soars This Decade

Cuban economic indicators
moved signiﬁcantly upward in the
seventies as opposed to the sixties,
Pitt director of Latin American
Studies, Carmelo Mesa-Lago said
at an international studies confer-
ence on Cuba’s international
economic role Wednesday.

Mesa-Lago cited the tremendous
boom in sugar prices, reintroduc-
tion of material incentives and a
Soviet modeled economy during
the early seventies as reasons for

the increased economic growth in

Cuba.

“However. these growth rates
will be almost impossible to sustain
over the second half of the
seventies,” Mesa-Lago said. “The
price of sugar, which makes up
about 85% of Cuba’s export income
will remain the same or drop."

The bulk of Cuban exports,
presently go to communist block
nations, but Mesa-Lago sees a
possible trend toward the west as

trading partners to cut freight

costs.

The Cuban economic model isn’t‘

applicablein Third World settings
because of the diversity of
economic conditions in each nation,
Associate Professor of Economics

at Carleton University, Archibald

Ritter said.

“Although the entire model isn’t
transferable, the Cuban focus on
redistribution of income before
economic growth is,” Ritter said

The use of international media,»
foreign aid, orthodox diplomacy,
and showing the world the Cuban
economy does work, are parts of
the Cuban strategy for dissemina-

ting its economic model, Ritter '

said. H

The University center for Latin
American Studies plans to publish.
some of the conference papers in
future issues of Cuban Studies and
possibly in book form, Mesa-Lago
said. ~

"7! Yearnof Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

1  Show of Solidarity

Black students at the University of Pittsburgh have reason to be

frustrated.

The students pay more for less. Along with a tuition hike that forced
many to drop out, the Black Studies department was cut back by the
University. This was one of many blows against a department that is

\ treated as a concession to black students, instead of receiving the

emphasis it warrants.

And black students must exist day to day in what is still a

predominantly white institution.

.The Student Government Board and its committees have eroded the
authority of BAS, taken over some of the roles it played in the black
student community. A prime example is’ Allocation Gommittee’s
ordering of Programming Committee to plan the Black Week concert,

despite BAS opposition.

It is obvious what the motivation was behind Wednesday night's
protest by 150 black students. And why it was directed against SGB.
E The protest was motivated by a dissatisfaction that has been fermenting
‘ over the years. A dissatisfaction that BAS had to bring to the surface.
Many question the cramming of 150 students in the third ﬂoor‘
conference room. But a handful of black leaders approaching the Board

\

during a meeting would have found their efforts futile. The solidarity of

r the Black Action Society had to demonstrated. The leaders had to show
that their movement had teeth behind it. .
V _ Support of Wednesday’s action, however, by no means condones the
threats against students and the holding of students and administrations

against their will.

The objectives of BAS could havebeen fulﬁlled without  on

individuals personal rights.

One must understand that the action was taken‘ against this institution
as a whole, not merely the Student Government Board. They are not the
villains they have been made out to be. The administration can not
shrug off the affair of the Board’s problem. Faculty, administration,
trustees, the student body all share the problem: and the guilt.

After Wednesdayinight, the plight of the black student must be clear

‘and present to the whole University community.

Therefore the

administration must not wait for a proposal, it must not wait for a
memorandum, it must not wait to be approached by a few black student

leaders. -

Instead it must take the initiative, it must meaningfully communicate ..
with black students on campus. Actions must be taken that Will relieve
the frustrations of the black student at Pitt. .

BAS Presents Grievances

We as concerned Black students
here at the University of Pitts-
burgh, feel it necessary to march in
non-violent protest of the following
conditions that exist and effect us
here at the University.

SOUTH AFRICA

We feel that the racist exploita-'

tive South African regime, with its
apartheid system and black slavery
be immediately overthrown and
controlled by the Black Majority.
We want the University of
Pittsburgh to support and publicly
make statements and actions to this
objective. We DEMAND that
Student Government begin to deal
with more political situations and
that they return our demands
through some immediate public
actions.

CAMPUS POLICE

We feel that the campus police
have...strong armed black people
here at Pitt and in this adjacent
community in racist proportions.
(Over 70% of all campus police
arrests being Black people). We

COMMUNITY I

We demand that the University
of Pittsburgh stop closing its doors
to the community and that there be
immediate development of com-
munity programs and activities
held here at Pitt. We feel that the
University is the center for
community activities and that the
community must have more access
to it's facilities. Pitt is supported
by each and every taxpayer by its
acceptance of state funds so we
demand that each taxpayer have
greater access to its facilities. We
demand that the University of
Pittsburgh make public statements
and actions to the effect of these
objectives. We demand the
Student Government begin immed-
iately to program and accept the
community as a priority. We
demand public statements and
actions to that effect.

statements and actions toward
these objectives. We demand the
Student Government accept this

' development as a priority and that

they develop public statements-and

ON CAMPUS BLACK
“FUNCTlQ_§S

We feel that the University _of
Pittsburgh has taken a nonchalant,
lackadaisical and uninterested
mechanical approach toward all
functions by Black students here at
Pitt. We feel that our programs
and cultural needs are viewed as
low priority items and we demand

restructuring and evaluation of the ‘

programming activities that are
occurring on this campus, so as to
be more representative of all
students. We feel that the
handling of Black dances and
parties here at Pitt has been one of
cutting, restricting and eliminating
and we demand an immediate
evaluation of the uses of all dance
facilities and gathering locations.

demand a non-commissioned police
force and that the University of
Pittsburgh immediately implement
the present recommendations of
the task force, and especially the
community committee. We de-
mand that the University of
Pittsburgh give a public progress
report on these recommendations
and that the Student Government
make public statements and actions
toward these objectives. Why has
the campus police increased with
an increase in Black Student
enrollment? _,

      

Ticket Losers-
Pay or Stowe

I would like to take this
opportunity to thank the Pitt food
service for their cooperation. I
would like to--unfortunately I can
not. You see, I had the misfortune
of losing the wallet which contained
my meal ticket. Naturally, I
reported the loss to the appropriate
officials. Their only response was
that it would cost me $10 to replace
it. Since I am a typical college
student and do not have $10 to
spare, I asked if there were some
way -I could get a temporary pass to
eat in the cafeteria.. That was (I
thought), if my ticket showed up
within a day or two I wouldn't be
out $10. After all, their records did
‘show I had paid for a 19-meal plan.
Obviously I was entitled to the
meals, so the food service wouldn't
be losing anything. Nevertheless,
they maintained that the only way I
could get the meals I had paid for
was to pay the 510. Thus, I could
either eat and give up any chance
of saving $10 or starve while
waiting to see if my meal ticket was
found. I am not protesting the
replacement fee. I can understand
how that is justified. What I am
protesting is the fact that the
University can acknowledge that I
am entitled to the meals and still
not be “human” enough to let me
eat while I see whether or not I
have to pay the replacement fee.
This seems to be merely their way
of pressing an unfair advantage--
ie., “either cough up or starve.

ﬁgure scarcely more than 300 of
those students are Black.

We have ,set a quota for the
1977-78 academic year of no less
than 625 Black freshmen. This is an

‘attempt to increase the Black

population to 25% of the total
undergraduate population at this
University (13,000). The ﬁgure of
25% is equal to the percentage of
Black peoplethat reside in the city
of Pittsburgh. In the long run we
will build the Black undergraduate
population to 3,250 students.

In order to effectively increase
the minority enrollment, additional
funds must be appropriated. Those.

We demand that the Black
fraternities and sororities and other
organizations be provided with
adequate space and conditions to
provide Black students with alter-
native programs and dances that
would be more representative of
our needs. We demand that the

cultural needs and habits. We

ment publicly produce statements
and actions toward these objec-
tives.

Black Undergraduate population
reaches 25% of the total under-

_ graduate population.

We also feel that the University
of Pittsburgh has attached a
remedial stigma to the U--CEP
program by placing it on a low
priority level and taking a
nonchalant attitude toward the
maintenance of that program.

As concerned Black students we
demand that the admission of
minority students, the U-CEP
program, and all other functions
orientated toward minority stu-
dents be given top priority by the
University of Pittsburgh.

Tom Wouldn't

I have never read such a
contradictory or just plain stupid
article than the one entitled “What
Hath Gimbels Wrought" written
by Tom Waseleski. You, dear Tom
wouldn’t know a pagan if one bit
you in the nose!! With a view like
your’s, shopping compared to the
“frosty six-pack" is definitely the
lesser evil in our city's Christian,
Jewish or what ever religion it is we
hold.

Concerning the mills, who are
you to say that/the millsrare the
only thing that should be “boom-
ing" on Sunday? What about the
Fire Department, hospitals, ambu-
lances, Police Department, and last
but certainly not least the Church??'
What would we do without these
things on any day let alone
Sunday?? I think you have your.
emphasis misplaced.

Also what's this bull about store
clerks not needing overtime? How
do you know they don’t need the

economical census of each clerk?
Not only do you put down certain
people's occupations but you have
also put down the good women of
our city. First of all what makes
you think the man is the only
working part of a marriage? A
women is certainly capable of'a
good job and certainly capable of
(as you would put it) being the one
who carries the money. If this were
not so why would there be any
women going to this University?
Besides that where do you get off at
calling liberation crap? Do you call
treating women as people or
anyone as a human should be
treated crap?

If anyone or anything sounds
pagan around Pittsburgh I would
say it is the person who
discriminates against people, oc-
cupations and prefers their “six-
pack.'' \

We recognize Black Studies as
the most important vehicle the
University of Pittsburgh has in
relation to’ understanding Black
people, our needs and our values.
We feel that Black Studies is
extremely important in this country
because of its input on the
stereotype ‘molding that occurs
with individuals that have no
knowledge of the true Black
experience. We feel that the
University of Pittsburgh‘ should
expand and increase the Black
Studies Department and courses.
And that certain courses in Black
Studies be mandatory to all UCEP
students to increase their know-
ledge. We demand that Student
Government make public state-
ments and pardons toward their
relationship with Black Studies.

The Pitt Professional Union
  and the Nyden Case

The undersigned have all been members of public sup-
porters of the PPU who now feel unable to remain silent, and
thereby implicated in the perversion of the principles of un-
ionism inherent in some of its recent actions and current po-

licies. We are emphatically still of the opinion that collective »

bargaining is a necessity for university faculities in the cur-
rent conditions of academic life. It is, in fact, the impossibil-
ity of ever winning a collective bargaining election with a self-
discredited organization that is the most disturbing and the
most depressing feature of the present situation. If there is
anysolution, it must begin with a full and open airing of the
issues, and a washing of the dirty linen in public.

While other actions of the Union have been disturbing to
some of us, we are primarily moved to protest here against its
role in the case of Paul J. Nyden, Assistant Professor of So-

ciology, who was denied a third contract by the University -

following a recommendation against his renewal by a vote of
14 to one of the senior members of his department, with one
abstention. Nyden contends that his academic freedom was
violated by his colleagues, and that they voted him down be-
cause of his political beliefs and activities. The department
contends that its decision was based exclusively on academic,
technical‘ and professional criteria and had nothing to do with
politics. We will not go into the merits of the case, since no par-
ticular position on the Nyden controvery is needed to see the
total incompetence and irresponsibility of the PPU’s actions.

In brief, we will present two main arguments:

(1) THAT THE UNlON’S S0 CALLED “GRIEVANCE
COMMITTEE” NEVER PERMITTED REPRESENTATIVES

. OF THE ACCUSED DEPARTMENT TO PRESENT TESTI-

MONY OR“ DOCUMENTATION IN ANSWER TO ‘THE

' SPECIFIC CHARGES RAISED BY NYDEN. THE UNION’S

“POSITION” (WHICH, AS WE WILL SEE, IS VERY DIFFI-
CULT TO IDENTIFY’FROM DAY TO DAY), WAS ARRIV-
ED AT WITHOUT BENEFIT OF HEARING THE OTHER
SIDE.

(2) THE UNION HAS GONE ON RECORD WITH A SE-
RIES OF CONTRADICTORY AND AMBIGUOUS STATE-
MENTS WHICH HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN CYNICAL-
LY MISREPRESENTED, NOT ONLY BY NUDEN AND HIS
SUPPORTERS BUT ALSO IN OFFICIAL UNION PUBLI-
CATIONS. PUBLIC ACTIONS OF UNION OFFICIALS
HAVE BEEN IN VIOLATION OF THE DECISIONS AR-
RIVED AT IN ACCORD WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRO-
CEDURES OF ITS CONSTITUTION. ' I

The details, and the documentation of these grave charges
follow. All quotations not otherwise labelled, are from the

, PPU minutes of the given date‘. In all quotations, we have re-
peated the text as it appears in the original, typographical
errors included. ‘

On March 15, 1976, in responseto a complaint by Nyden,
the Executive Council of the PPU “authorized the creation of
a grievance committee to investigate the facts in the situation
‘and to make a recommendation to the PPU for subsequent
action.” A week later that committee reported with the fol-
lowing recommendation: ‘

The Recommendation of the Committee to the Executive
.Council was that Professor N yden ’s grievance against the So-

_, ciology Department should be accepted by the PPU. Further-

more, the ‘committee expressed the view that there is suffi-
cient circum-stan tial evidence to bring them to the view that a
violation of academic freedom may be involved.

The Committee recommended that a grievance committe'é
be constituted to deal with the N yden case. The Committee

. recommended, also, that the grievance committee decide on

when and how to do each of the following while it is process-
ing the grieyance: '

1) send a message of concern to the Senate ’s Tenure and
Academic Freedom Committee and to call to that body ’s atten-
tion the possibility of a violation of academic freedom; (2)
inform Professor-Holzner of PPU’s interest in the grievance
and ask him to cooperate with the union; (3) send a message
and a delegation to Dean Rosenberg to inform him of the PPU
interest in the case;* (5) alert the Allegheny County Labor
Council of the possibility that a violation of academic free-
dom may be involved in the decision to termination Nyden;
(6) send a message to the American Federation of Teachers
to alert them of the possibility that N yden ’s academic free-
dom has been violated.

_ In the course of the discussion on the report and the rec-
ommendationsmade by Professor Houston and Dr. Mark Mc-

i Colloch a motion was placed before the Executive Council. _
A The Motion was passed. The features of the motion: (1) I
- Houston and McColloch will write up a formal report of their
investigation; (2) The--report will be presented to the PPU _
. Steering Committee; (3) A grievance committee will be con-

stituted; (4) The grievance committee will receive the investi-
gating committee ’s report; (5) The grievance committee shall
decide how to implement the six-action steps included in the
investigating committee ’s recommendations.

The Executive’ Council was unanimous in the decision to
acknowledge that Dr. N yden has a grievance.

’*Note that-the fourth item is missing.

The confusion of the Union’s procedures is apparent. The
very meaning of a “grievance committee” is unknown: the
“grievance” committee” appointed on March 15 recommends,
on March 22 “that a grievance committee be consituted.” We
believe that the subsequent events described below show how
this organizational confusion has at times been exploited by
politically committed supporters of Nyden at the cost of the
destruction of the integrity of the organization. In some in-
stances, undoubtedly, simple organizational ineptitude pro-
duced inconsistencies which give the appearance of devious-
ness, and it is not always possible for outsiders with the avail-
able documentation to know which misrepresentations to at-
tribute to deliberate action, and which to incompetence. We
will try to be generous.

_ In later documents, the first committee is called a “com-
mittee of inquiry” while the second is referred to as a “grie-
vance committee,” reﬂecting an apparent division of labor
whereby the first was to “investigate and make recommenda-
tions,” while the second is charged merely with “processing”
the grievance or “implementing” the relevant Union decisions.

In light of subsequent events, we find this supposed divi-
sion of functions between the two committees a clever piece
of sleight of hand. After all, if the first committee investigates

there is no need for the second committee to call witnesses or
study documents. At the very beginning of thegwork of the
first committee, one of the undersigned, Gilbert Shapiro, was
interviewed, but this was the only occasion on which any
spokesman for the sociology department position was heard
by either committee. Shapiro was told that the committee
was charged with a preliminary investigation, designed only
to discover if sufficient grounds could be found to warrant
the appointment of a “grievance committee” which would
then be responsible for athorough investigation, taking testi-

‘ many and studying documents point by point.

In this sole interview as spokesman for the department,
‘Shapiro wasgpemiitted to describe the procedure used in Ny-
den’s evauluation, and the basis for the decision, but he was
not. confronted with any of the speciﬁc charges which emerg-
ed in the reports of the two committees. In fact, some of the
charges in those reports were totally new to the sociology de-

partment when the reports appeared, and some even referred
to actions the department is accused of taking after the date
of Shapiro’s interview. As we will see, the second committee
felt free to proceed without any inquiry on the grounds that
a complete investigation had already been performed by the
first committee! The fraudulence of the claim that there had
been a serious investigation is apparent in a repo_rt_to _mem-
bers by President John Beverley dated Sept. 29_, in which he
states that “The committee conducted extensive interviews
with PPU members in Sociology,” specifically (besides Shapiro)
Nyden, the only two faculty members who have publicly sup-
ported Nyden, and graduate students who played no role in
the decision. Not only did neither committee seriously inves-
tigate anything, but the remarkable haste of the entire proce-
dure‘ ought to have made that fact perfectly obvious to the

’ Executive Council to whom they reported. The PPU commit-

ted itself to actions on March 22, but the Sociology Depart-
ment’s decision had only been made late in the evening of
March 19.

"The first committee’s findings were all phrased as tenta-
tive hypotheses: violations of, academic freedom, they say,
“may be involved”; the “possibility” of a violation of aca-
demic freedom is to be communicated to the Senate Com-
mittee, and to the AFT. The “processing" of the grievance

(the charge of the second committee), is to include “action.

steps,” but, despite the representations given to Shapiro, no
mention is made of further inquiry to discover if the possibil-
ities found by the first committee should be declared actual
facts.

Like the later Union declarations on the case, the unani-
mous decision that “Dr. Nyden has a grievance” admits of,
and has received, the widest variety of interpretations. When-
ever they are accused of deciding on the guilt of the Sociology
Department on the basis of a report asserting mere possibil-
ities, the PPU Executive Council can answer that they have
asserted only that Dr. Nyden was unhappy, which while not
very informative, has to be regarded as plausible. The recom-
mendation that Nyden’s grievance “should be accepted by
the PPU” is in the same rhetorical category of studied confu-
sion. Does this mean that the position of Dr. Nyden is en-
dorsed, or that the Union accepts a responsibility to study
the question in order to arrive at a decision? The statement
could serve, later, to justify the absence of any subsequent in-
quiry by the second committee, even if it had actually passed
Council as an innocent act of placing the controversy on the
Union’s future agenda.

A week later, March 29, the Executive Council seems again
to have received a report from the first “grievance committee.”
B. The Houston-McColloch committee report, “PPU Investig-
ation on the Paul N yden Case,” was submitted to the Execu-
tive Council. Professor Houston announced that the grievance
committee in this case is comprised of Holland, J. Kanefsky,
landy,’ Houston, Schmidt, and Sullivan.‘* The members of
this committee are prepared to implement the action steps
recommended by Council at last week’s meeting, including a
statement to the public. This committee is awaiting guide-

lines from the Executive Council before it proceeds to carry»

out its charges.

C. The Council reviewed the Houston-McColloch Report, and
some changes were made. A motion was introduced: The Exe-
cutive Council accepts the Report of PPU ‘Investigation Com-
mittee and should submit it to the grievance committee. The
Report is to be used by the grievance committee. The griev-
ance committee shall develop concrete strategies and propos-
als for implementing the Executive Council’s recommenda-
tions.‘ the grievance committee shall take no action until it
reports to the Executive Council. In no sense does the Execu-
tive Council ’s sending of the Report to the grievance commit-
tee preclude the grievance committee from making additional
inquiries before it recommends any action to the Council.

, Motion Passed. _
D. There wasextensive discussion over the Nyden case, and

the Council held the view that the PPU grievance committee
shall proceed in its activity in a way that will-keep it indepen-
dent of any other “defense" that is operating in Professor
N yden 's behalf

E. Professor Hall indicated he would prepare a “minority re-
por’:';‘ for the grievance committee; Professor Chester will join
wit im.

*James G. Holland, Associate Professor of Psychology; Mor-
ton Kanefsky, Associate Professor o_f E ngineering;Marcia Lan-
dy, Associate Professor of English; David B. Houston, Profes-
sor of Economics; Oswald Schmidt, Associate Professor of
Geography; and Ken Sullivan, TA in History.

These minutes are remarkable. First, we must leave to the
reader any speculation on the significance of the fact that
Houston “announced" to the Council the membership ofla
committee that, apparently, only the same Council was em-
powered to appoint. Since a grievance procedure has no real
meaning in the absence of a collective bargaining contract,
particularly when instituted against one’s colleagues rather
than against the employer, nothing should surprise us in the
way in which such a group is selected, or how it goes about
its work. We are, nevertheless, amazed to discover that the list
_of recommendations to alert various agencies to the possibil-
ity of a violation of academic freedom of March 22 have be-
come steps in “implementation” of an independent “defense”
of Nyden by March 29. (A statement to the public” does not
atppea)r in the March 22 list; perhaps it is the missing fourth
I em.

And, once again, we are confused as to what actions Coun-
cil is actually taking when we read that it “accepts” the re-
port, and “submits” it to the (new and enlarged) “grievance
committee.” Does this imply that Council approves the re-
port, and “submits” or “process” it’? Or does it mean that
Council simply and politely received it and, in thenormal
manner whereby committees with similar functions share in-
formation in any organization, delivered it to the new com-
mittee for its information, and for whatever use they might
wish to put it? If the latter, why bother to indicate so rou-
tine an action in the minutes? Like the assertion that-“Nyden
has a grievance,” the statement that the report is “accepted”
and “submitted" to the successor committee seems designed
to obfuscate, permitting union officers to claim that they
have or have not endorsed it depending upon whom they face
at the moment.

The statement that the second grievance committee would
be free to make “additional inquiries” is most important,
since it demonstrates that this second committee was not
charged with_making additional inquiries. (In fact, it ultimate-
ly came to its conclusions without any such voluntary ef-
forts.) If we recall that the product of the “investigation”
conducted by the first committee was a report declaring the
mere possibility of inequities, the fact that the second com-
mittee made no further inquiry, but depended entirely on the
results of the first committee’s work, appears of prime im-
portance. .

The new, six person, grievance committee, with no fur-
ther inquiry, brought a “Statement” to the Executive Coun-
cil, which acted as follows at the meeting of April 5:

. . . Given editorial changes which will be made by the griev-
ance committee and submitted to the PPU Steering Commit-

i tee this week, the Council accepts the conclusions of the doc-

..r

ument as they are expressed in the first paragraph. The Coun-
cil requests that the en tire membership of the grievance com-
mittee review the document and put their names to it before
it is brought to the Steering Committee. The motion was
passed.

It would seem that Council is ready to endorse the con-

clusions of this document but not its phrasing or details.
Council acted on the revised statement April 12.
IV. The N yden Grievance Case: There was extensive discussion
of the revised Statement on the N yden Case, since the Steer-
ing Committee was unable to recommend its adoption. The
new version was given to the Steering Committee with the
signatures of each of the six members of the grievance com-
mittee. The Executive Council voted in favor of the follow-
ing motion dealing with the document: The PPU Executive
Council accepts the Report of the Grievance Committee; it
represents the PPU’s public statement on the Nyden case
(thus far). The vote on this motion was 7 in favor and 3 in
opposition. _

Despite this clear claim that all six membersof the griev-
ance committee signed the statement, only five signatures ap-
pear on the document! Of those “announced” by Houston as
comprising the committee on March 29, all names appear ex-
cept that of Prof.‘Morton Kanefsky, who stopped attending
after the initial meeting. The minutes of April 19 carry a cor-
rection, but we remain puzzled by this entire sequence of
events. _In our decades of experience in all kinds of academic
organizations, we know of no precedent for the requirement

that all members of a committeepersonally signa commit-'

tee report. We can not escape the inference that some mem-
bers of the Executive Council suspected that misrepresenta-
tions of the unanimity of the committee were afoot and ap-
parently with good reason, unless we believe that our col-
leagues have some difficulty in counting to six.

The opposition within the Executive Council, and the dis-

approval of this document by the Steering Committee, are
not‘surprising. It contains a large number of serious but un-
substantiated allegations and accusations produced by a com-
mittee which had not attempted to interview any spokesman
of the Sociology group under attack. The Sociology Depart-
ment was accused, for example, of deliberating leaking a con-
fidential document about Nyden to the Pitt News, without
one shred of evidence, let alone the courtesy of a confronta-
tion. Nevertheless, the membership meeting held the same
day (April 12) seems to have endorsed this slander.
NYDEN CASE—Most of the time at the meeting was spent
discussing the N yden case. Dave Houston presented there-
port from the Grievance Committee." The document on the
PPU position was read aloud, and discussion and debate en-
sued. Vanmade a motion that the membership not adopt this
report as the PPU position because of the serious nature of
the charges around academicfreedom violations. The motion
was defeated by a vote of 9 yes to I 7 no. Then Michel Roub-
lev made a motion to accept the spirit of the document but
to revise it in the spirit of. the comments made earlier by Dr.
Colodny (i.e. to put an emphasis on the question of whether
or not N yden was fired for political reasons. Beverly made 2
friendly amendments: that the substantive content of the
document also be maintained and that the revision of the
document be done by next Monday ’s Executive Council
meeting. The motion by Roublev passed by a vote of16 yes
and 8 no. The Grievance Committee was asked to revise the
document along with Colodny, Beverley, and Roublev with
Beverley convening the committee.

(To add to the confusion, the minutes of April 19 carry
the claim that the minutes of both the Council meeting and
the membership meeting of April 12 are incomplete. A “Res-
olution on the Nyden Case” was, it is claimed, adopted at
both meetings; we analyze that Resolution below.)

The ambiguities and the contradictions of this day’s vari-

ous proceedings, while presenting a spurious appearance of
unity, has subsequently permitted -Nyden and his supporters,
in and outside the Union, to portray the Union as in ‘-‘sup-
port” of Nyden and in condemnation of the Department of
Sociology. ‘As the minutes show, the membership rejected
the motion by Van Beck Hall to reject the committee report,
while they voted to accept only its “spirit.” On the hopeful
assumption that their differences were merely over the word-
ing, rather than over the substance of the report, a committee
was fonned to rewrite the statement. But because the dis-
agreement was not over words or details, the compromise

< document that emerged is simply, bizarre.

A “Statement on the Grievance Submitted by Dr. Paul
Nyden (Sociology),” was endorsed by the Executive Council
on April 19, and this document, along with the “Resolution”
mentioned above, are designated the official position of the
union today. The original grievance committee report which
was adopted “in spirit” at the membership meeting, at least
had the merit of the clarity of a definitive affirmation: ,

The Pitt Professional Union, AFT Local 3414, believes
that the nonrenewal of Professor Paul N yden ‘s contract by
the Sociology Department of the University of Pittsburgh is
improper both because of failure to follow equitable proce-
dures and for failure to make a convincing substantive case
justifying his dismissal. The PPU also believes that there exists
in fact a reasonable case that Professor Nyden’s firing had
political causes.

Theredrafted version, the “Statement,” however, speaks
only of “questions raised” and “evidence presented with sug-
gests” a lack of equity in the evaluation, and the possibility
of a violation of Nyden’s rights, a possibility which leads the
PPU to’ request that the university administration launch a
full scale inquiry into the matter. We are told, in addition,
that “The'Sociology Department has yet to present publicy a
convincing substantive case justifying Dr. Nyden’s non-renew-
al” as it were standard procedure of the University of Pitts-
burgh to damn publicly those not offered contracts. We know
of no precedent for such an action. _

The strongest conclusion in the two documents comes at
the beginning of the “Resolution on the Nyden Case” where
we find the amazing declaration that the non-renewal of Ny-
den’s contract “is improper because of claims that the depart-
ment 1) failed to follow equitable and/or established or cus-
tomary procedures and 2) failed to make a substantive case
justifying his dismissal . . .” (Our emphasis) Nowhere does it
say that these claims are justified or even what the evidence
for mere plausibility might be. Entirely consistent with the
absence of an inquiry, the PPU’s‘ judgment of impropriety is
explicitly based not on any established facts, but on the mere
existence of “claims,” which can, of course, be manufactured
by the candidate wholesale, at a moment’s notice.

Subsequently, in his Sept. 29 letter to the membership,
President John Beverley has presented an interpretation of
the true meaning of the statement that the “termination is
improper because of claims that . . .” Beverley suggests that
so long as the questions had been raised, Nyden should not
have been terminated until they had been resolved by a prop-
er inquiry. “Clearly we think that the University should not
have moved "to fire Professor Nyden while serious questions
about his case were pending . . .” What could be more civil-
ized? However, as the President of the PPU surely knows, the
University follows the rule that faculty must be given a full
year’s notice of termination and, in fact, if the Dean did not
terminate Nyden when he did, he would have automatically
received a‘-"renewal of his contract. Then the game would be
over, and there would be no need for the PPU’s proposed in-
quir_y. Fortunately taking the PPU’s advice as less than com-
pelhng, the Dean proceeded to terminate Nyden in time,

if ()n.Sci-I-i scene

Trekkies I-lave New Rival

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Trekkies, beware! You no
longer dominate the science fiction
scene in Pittsburgh, if in fact, you
ever did. The Western Pennsyl-
vania Science Fiction Association
(WPSFA, pronounced whoopsfa)
has been around for nearly ten years
and continues to grow.

The Pittsburgh chapter, founded
in the mid sixties by four C-MU
students, is called PgHLANGE.

“We're very into acronyms,"
explained PgHLANGE treasurer
Barbara Geraud. “Anything that
sounds weird so you sound slightly
crazy."

PgHLANGE corresponds with
several science fiction clubs across ’
the country, like CLEAVAGE
(Cleaveland) and PHILOCON
(Philadelphia). PgHLANGE presi-
dient Ira Kaplowitz said that not all
clubs go for the punning names;
CONFUSION in Ann Arbor was
named “for the spirit in which the
convention was run.”

Conventions are big events for
science fiction clubs. Each chapter
not only hosts a convention of its
own, but attends those of other
chapters. Geraud says you can
attend a convention every two
weeks “if you time it right." In fact,
in 4 her 18 months as a
“PgHLANCE," Geraud has atten-
ded no less than 14 conventions.

The Pittsburgh cahpter’s annual
convention called relaxicon has had‘
such prestigious speakers as writers
Robert Silverberg and Harlan
Ellison. “Pros are quite acces-
sible," Geraud said. RELAXICON
is held during the last week of
September and planning for it
begins almost as soon _as the last
convention ends.

“Things are tentative," Kaplo-
witz explained. “We're still
negotiating with several hotels for
the best deal."

Besides the guest lecturer, the
convention also provides all night
movies—“whatever is cheap"—-
and a midnight trolley ride.
Sometimes. there are panel discus-
sions, and the affair is capped with a
banquet for the guest of honor.

“This year sci-fi writer Joe
Haldeman was talking about how he
wanted to be an astronaut," Geraud
recalled. She said Haldeman had
found that NASA was accepting
applications from civilians and he
urged the audience to apply.

Besides their own convention
plans, PgHLANGE members or-
ganize car pools to take them to
other conventions but mostly,
according to Geraud, they just
discuss science fiction.

“We serve as a catalyst for --

conversation," Geraud said. “Our
common basis is we all like s.f."

Last year, PgHLANGE became
incorporated into the C-MU club
system which simplifies things,
according to Kaplowitz.
now has a regular meeting place at
C-MU Skibo Hall every Sunday
afternoon at 2 p.m.

“Now that we have a place, to
meet- regularly and have privacy,
more people are coming. They now
know how to find us," Kaplowitz
said. “The basic thing I’d like to see
come through is mainly a place for
like-minded people to meet each
other."

While a high percentage of
members are C-MU students,
membership is open to all.

_“We get everything from book-
keepers to strippers," Geraud, a

71972 Pitt graduate said.

The club “

"The

diversity is fantastic.’

"We've had some growing pains.
Most of PgHLANGE group," she
continued. “There are people
coming in who want to be a lot more
active than the old members and,
quite frankly, it has cause a lot of
friction."
You can ‘read science fiction on
‘your own and discuss it with
friends. but where else could you
get a chance to talk with your
favorite writers—which is one of the
selling points of WPSFA, Geraud
said.

A few weeks ago, Geraud got the
chance to talk to her favorite writer,
Harlan Ellison at Kent State's
convention. '

"He's very strange. He drinks
Perrier water. Someone later told
me he was depressed thatweekend,
Geraud said. ‘‘I’d hate to see him.
when he's really in an up mood.
He's like a speed freak but he never
touches drugs."

Geraud is quick to point out that
an important thing about science
fiction conventions is the chance for
calm discussions with the celebri-
ties. The fans don’t just like a mob
of shrieking groupies, according to
Geraud.

Speaking of shrieking groupies,
that's a good WPSFAer's definition
of a trekkie. - '

“We hate trekkies! ” Geraud said.
"Trekkies only seem to be
interested in the series and it's
writers and how much they love
Leonard Nimoy‘s ears."

I karos-- A “Nice
Out Of The
Way Restaurant”

BY PETE BUTCH

The Ikaros is a Greek restaurant
on Walnut Street in Shadyside.
Being an American whose heritage
goes back four generations to a
great-grandfather who came over
from Italy; and a cook who never
worked under a Greek chef, I had
no way to judge the restaurant. I
could tell if'the food was good food,
but not good Greek food.

So my partner and I enlisted the
aid of a post-doctoral researcher
employed by Pitt who is also a
native Greek, Telesilla Kypriou.

The Ikaros does not have an ideal
location. It is on the second ﬂoor of
a building that already houses
another business. The entrance is
in an alley beside the building.

The only way the interior design
could be considered Greek is
through its Spartan appearance. It

" was clean, but not much more than

paint, wallpaper, and tables
crammed together.. Greek music
wafted outof stereo speakers.

Once seated we perused a menu
that was half Greek, half American.
All the fish dishes were. American.
This. disappointed me, especially
when Telesila informed me that
indeed, ﬁsh was a part of the Greek
cuisine.

Actually, only three of the six
entrees were Greek—shish kabob,
pastitsio, and mousaka.

The entrees themselves were

very econmical. They came with
soup, a nice sized salad, bread and
butter. vegetable, and coffee or
tea. The appetizers, on the
contrary, were small portions for
one to two dollars.

The waiter first brought the soup
of the day, Chicken Angolemono. It
was a rice soup with a stock made
of chicken broth, lemon juice and
egg. And it was very good.

We ordered three different
appetizers to get a good sampling.

"They were tasty, but expensive.

The stuffed grape leaves are classic
Greek and a must to try. The most

unique of the three was the

Taramosalate, a concoction of
smoked ﬁsh eggs, bread, olive oil
and vinegar all ground into a pate.
It was very good, in spite of the way
it sounds.

The most expensive was the
Tiropites, a light pasty with a
cheese-egg ﬁlling. It was served
very hot and fresh from the oven.‘
which made it taste even better.
But four of the small pastries cost
about $2.50-.

Next came the salad, much to
Telesila’s dismay, “In a real Greek
restaurant the salad is either
served with the meal or after it, not
before. This is not how it is done in
Greece?

The salad allegedly had a tomato
dressing. It had a closer
resemblance to watered down
ketchup. Telesila also noted the
absence or oregano and salad oil.

Next came the entrees, Pastitso
and Mousaka. Pastitso was large
macaroni noodles with spicy
ground meat and tomato sauce. it
was covered with a white sauce.
Mousaka was eggplant and ground
meat in a white sauce. Although
both tasted good to the novice taste
bud, Telesila pointed out that both
had been overcooked. The tastes of

all the main ingredients had been’

allowed.to mingle.

I saw- her point. These were
casserole dishes that could be
cooked ahead of time and then
heated to order.

All in all it was a nice place.
Keep it in mind the next time you
want to use the line, “I know this
nice out-of-the-way Greek restaur-
ant.”

 

 

leaving him free to appeal through the University’s gover-
nance procedures. '

It appears that the question, “Does the PPU support Ny-
den?” can be answered differently depending upon who at
the moment answers thephone. But we do ﬁnd, at least in
terms of actions that count, an increasing tendency to “im-
plement” the Union’s “position” by providing Nyden with
moral and material support.

For one thing, the various committees supporting Nyden’s

7 cause have not hesitated to list the PPU as one of his “sup-

porting organizations," without any effective protest from
the Union. In his Sept. 29 letter to the membership, Beverley
testifies that the PPU gave no permission for this use of its
name, and assures us that “Council will bring to the attention
of the groups concerned and of the public record the improp-
er use of our name in these instances and instruct them not
to use the PPU name without a specific request to and ap-
proval by Council.” Despite this “instruction,” Nyden once
again claimed PPU‘ endorsement in a letter to the University
Times of October 7, in which he defends the authenticity of
precisely those assertions of support that the Council dis-
avowed, by quoting, incidentally, ambi nous passages from
the official PPU “Statement” endorse by the Council on
April 19! ~

In addition, the May 24 minutes show the Executive Coun-
cil approving moves to approach the AFT to provide Nyden
with legal defense funds. It appears that this request was turn-
ed down on the grounds that Nyden has no case. Similarly,
on July 19 the membership voted to ask the AFT national
convention -to “support the local’s resolutions” on the Nyden
_case, and, in order to coordinate with the “United Action
Caucus" (which planned to bring other.motions on the sub-
ject before the convention) the PPU’s delegate was instructed

‘ to “not oppose, any other attempts to bring the Nyden case '

before the ‘convention  . .""Since the PPU delegate failed to

attend the convention, and the United" Action _C__a‘ucus" failed . .

of Nyden.” This demand only appears in the “grievance com-
mittee” statement which was so extreme that it was rejected
by the Steering Committee and accepted only “in spirit” at
the membership meeting. (And even in that document it is
coupled with the alternative proposal of “new equitable re-
view procedures involving impartial academic arbitrators from
within the University or the profession of sociology, satisfac-
tory to both Professor Nyden and the Department of So-.
ciology.")

The American Teacher statement, then, is absolutely con-
trary to the fact. It does seem foolish for the drafting com-
mittee to have worked so hard in an effort to produce a judi-
cious appearance when the PPU’s public stance is to be des-
cribed so differently in an official AFT publication.

In his letter of September 29, Beverley declares that the
American Teacher article was “based on materials sent by the
grievance committee.” Under’ the- circumstances, he is not
prepared to disavow the article despite its clear misrepresent-
ation of the official PPU position, as he elsewhere describes it.
Heroically, he manages to square the statement in the Ameri-
can Teacher that PPU‘ resolutions call for a reinstatement of
Nyden with the claim that the PPU has not made a decision
on the merits of the case. The exercise provides some enter-
tainment, badly needed in the midst of this dreary affair.
“Clearly,” Beverley says in public, “We would demand his
immediate reinstatement should his charges be substantiated
in the course of further investigation and review of the kind
the Union has recommended.” Thus, the fraudulent claim
that the PPU has called for reinstatement is regarded as a
proper “interpretation" of the fact that the PPU, like the rest
of us, would demand his reinstatement if he should prove the
validity of his case!

mark in the history of the University. In the early 1960’s an

In the 1930’s faculty members were fired whose political
high crimes and misdemeanors consisted of open support for
the ACLU and social security legislation. A 1‘ Dr. N yden ’s re-
quest the PPU has entered the case, following the Union 's
standard procedure of constituting a committee to investi-
gate grievances which members bring to the Union. Below are
the full texts of the ‘committee ’s report and a PPU resolution
based on the report. In addition to the PPU's intervention,
the American Sociological Association has also decided to in-
vestigate Dr. N yden ’s grievance. _

This direct violation of the instructions of the Executive
Council by the editor of the Advocate can hardly be explain-
ed as due to a failure of communication between the Council
and the editor, as if we were dealing here with some massive
bureaucracy in which essential messages get lost. More plau-
sibly, we ﬁnd this an additional indication that a politically
committed group within the Union is willing to violate deci-
sions democratically arrived at when they regard themselves
as able to get away with it. We find it puzzling that they can
get away with so much. The same Executive Council whose
instruction for a preface was so clearly", defied, on July 6,
“congratulated” the editor “on the fine edition of the Advo-
cate which he edited.”

The present leadership of PPU seems to be trying to prove
the case of the enemies of collective bargaining at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, that the values of Union and of University.
are incompatible. We know that there are good people‘ still
active in the PPU who have fought, at times valiantly, against
such tactics and the perversion of the organization. We must
note, sadly or angrily, thatthe PPU, at the moment, acts as if
dominated by a parochial political cabal exploiting cynically
amass of dues-payers with no sympathy at-all with their holy,
_cause. Does the Union seriously expect _ever to win a collec-

.ti_ve.ba_rgaining election in this way? -

1 ComputerClub Plays Games \

73

BY BARB THOMAS

Every second Sunday of the
month 75 people, 12-70 in age,
gather to discuss computers. They
are members of the Pittsburgh
Area Computer Club (PACC), a
non-profit, educational organiza-
tion for those interested in
computers.

Pitt student, Bob Hoffman, a
computer club member, attributes
the year-old group's success to the
invention of the micro-computer,”
the second computer revolution.
“These computers are desk-top
size but have the computing
powers of alarge console. They are
relatively inexpensive, Hoffman
said, ranging from $250 to the
thousands.

This makes them, he said,
accessible to hobbyists. Surpris-
ingly enough the pocket calculator,

a type of mini—computer, is only a».

few years old. It is hard to imagine
struggling through engineering
courses without it.

“The members range from
people who started with computers
in 1947 to people who have read
about them and are interested.”
Hoffman said, “Everyone in the
group has something to offer.
Someone who doesn’t know any-
thing about programming may
have an idea for a game or an

application and there is always
someone else who can ﬁgure out
the program.”

The group discusses problems
with their own computers, how-
ever, according to Hoffman, their
major interest is in the games they
can play. “The grandaddy of all
games is ‘Space War.’

‘Star Trek’ is a derivative.

In these games, A person sits in
front of a terminal and the
computer gives the position of the
space ship, or Enterprise, and the
invasion ﬂeet. The object is to

‘shoot down the ﬂeet in as few

moves as possible; Other games
computers. play include tic-tac-toe
and chess. They can also give
unique renditions of Bach’s “Toc-
cata and Fugue in D minor.”

The PACC orders materials at
group rates and many of the
members build their own systems
from surplus computers. The
PACC merged with the Cleveland
Digital Club to form the MACC,
Midwestern Association Computer
Club. The MACC had its first
Computer Fest in June, 1976 in
Cleveland. p_ _

Hoffman expects the group to
expand, although it is still looking
for a permanent meeting place.
The group is also trying to get
federal status as a nonproﬁt

‘Equus’ Pushes Drama

To Emotional Limit

BY LEAH McFARLAN D .

The idea of a timeless play is
usually associated with days gone
by, with the traditional, with the
superstars of stage and screen.

And the experience of seeing a
truly timeless play which is not a
resuscitated classic but a first run,
product of our age production is
pure pleasure.»

praise-—for their talent and their
courage. They have pushed the
possibilities of their medium to
dangerous limits——to limits where
less talent or less work might have
resulted in chaos or even worse in
failure to involve the audience in the
emotional grip of the drama. But
here, everything works perfectly.
There is a special high in knowing
that a risk has been taken, and that
it has been successful.

Such a play is Equus. V,

The story revolves around one
central incident——a 17-year-old boy,
supposedly very gentle, who loves
horses, has in one night yblinded six
horses in the stable where he works.
Alan Strang is the boy (played by
Bill Barrett) and Martin Dysart
(David Leary) is/the child psychia-
trist who probes through the layers
of recalcitrance, sexual frustration,

V parental suppression and religious

hysteria to recreate the agony which
drove the boy to the mutilation of
the horses.

But Equus is not really the story
of a perverted V child in rural
southern England. It is, as the
psychiatrist begins to realize, the
story of passion, of worship, of the
need for something thrilling and
beautiful and agonizingly intense in
every life.

To be successful, the intensity
revealed in the drama must affect

‘Corrie’: Comedy of Powers

BY M. C. PILECKI

There’s nothing like consistency
in movie directing.

Especially in watching the career
of Brian DePalma—there’s nothing
anywhere near approaching consis-
tency. Which nobody misses,
anyway. First he made it big with
Sisters, a sort of Psycho meets Rear
Window, a gruesome ﬁlm that,
despite the use of color stock, kept
down the gore. Then came a wild,
bizarre rock version of Phantom of
the Opera, with overtones of Faust

and The Picture of Dorian

——namely The Phantom of the
Paradise. Which ﬂopped. Badly.
(Still, it may yet be recognized as a
good, if not great, ﬁlm.) V
Earlier this year DePalma again
honored one of his chief inﬂuences,
Alfred Hitchcock's work, with
Obsession, a romantic thriller
easily recognized (right down to the
music) as a salute to the Vmaterwork
Vertigo.
A Now i DePalma has done an
aboutface and thrown caution to

the winds with Carrie, a grisly film

heavy on the shocks and so bloddy

V-one almost becomes used to it.

In .a way, ‘it’s DePalma’s own
Psycho, a beastly comedyV in which
he‘ sees how much he can get away
with on the screen, toying with the
audience’s sympathies past all
vestiges of ‘ ‘ decency. ' ’

The story concerns a telekinetic
young high school girl (wellplayed
by Sissy Spacek) who is easily the

"most unpopular kid in school. She

lives in a rundown old house with a
deranged, misogynistic religious
fanatic’ for a mother (Piper. Laurie,
who only occasionally overdoes it),
who never even told the poor kid
about menstruation. Obviously she
has a problem, already.

Well, 'she’s. not outgoing, she
dresses poorly, she’s naive--you

the audience. It must touch some
chord in each viewer. It must bring
to view the passions of the past, the
worship which has been lost under
the rubble of daily living, the de§ire
to experience that kind of intensity
again. And it does.

In addition to fine performances
by the leading actors, Equus owes
much of its success to outstanding
costuming and lighting. The idea of

’ putting ﬁve large men on a stage

and asking the audience to believe
that they are horses smacks of a
pipedream.

But the introduction of these
characters as ritualistic god-ﬁgures
produces the intended 'effect
perfectly. They were simply five.
men, each dressed in a brown
turtleneck shirt and brown corduroy
jeans, each having two metal cages
ending in horseshoes strapped to
their feet and each lowering a
cage of a
horsehead over their heads.

'Carrie ':

(Continued from‘ Page 10)
very sweet revenge against all

p those people who have been nasty

to her soon turns into a real
chamber of horrors as friend, foe
and stranger alikewperish. Finally,
it turns into a grim comedy of “is
this ever going to end?" «-

And when it does, DePalma has
a ﬁnal little joke on his audience, a
perfect punchline to his tale of
terror. O

Carrie is certainly scary, which,
while not really poetic, is the main
criterion for this sort of ﬂick. It's
also a satire’ on high school
mores—the cruelties of that sub-
culture-—-with a sarcastic aside to
religion. Laurie's fanatic mother is
simply organized religion taken to
its extremes in what it exacts from
its followers. The juxtaposition of
the sadomasochistic cruciﬁx in the
closet “chapel” and the sprawled
ﬁgure of Piper Laurie at the end of
the movie is grotesquely humor-
ous. R

If——with all the TV sitcoms-
anyone gets the idea that high
school days were rosy (or happy, as
the case may be), Carrie can set the
record straight. The severe
persecution of the “outsider,” the
violent selﬁshness of adolescence
is a strong theme in the ﬁlm, as is
the fear involved in simply growing
up. The ﬁlm turns on the point of
Carrie’s ﬁrst menstrual period, an
experience that terriﬁes her be-
cause she didn’t expect it and
couldn’t understand it, and be-
cause her reaction to-it caused an
especially frightful scene of abuse
from her classmates.

For his major scene of the prom
night, DePalma again uses the
split-screen so effective in Sisters,
as well as some other techniques
that, while perhaps gimmicky, do
work rather well. The ‘music
underscores the action rather _well,
with a bit of a salute to the late
Bernard Herrmann’s technique of
Psycho.

DePalma seems to be the only
one of the modern wave of directors
who has discovered a second sex
and regularly does movies that
have real female characters.
Indeed, both Sisters and Carrie
were both primarily two-woman
ﬁlms, with men in supporting roles

O «C only, while his other flicks featured

And yet, with the aid of that
piercing ray of light which glittered
with such merciless purity from the
horseheads, and with the natural,
meaningless movements of a

horse’s head perfectly integrated, ‘

they seemed like gods of some
long-dead people. Worship them?
It certainly seemed the natural
thing to do.

As a drama, Equus uses
economical ‘direction, strong acting

and the almost frightening costum- ’
ing to produce a strange irregular ‘

sense of timing. '

Read as a play, it is confusing.
Yet it seems perfect for the
psychiatrist to speak both as
narrator and as participant in the
action during several scenes.
That's a delicate line between

entrapping an audience and over- ~

whelming it. With an awesome
balance of raw feeling and precise
crafting, Equus toed that line
perfectly.

burgers, King Kong on the Ajax
container and an GAF camera
ads," Reed said. “All because
money buys advertising.”

Even strands of ape hair in a
plastic holder on a key chain are
supposed to bemarketed, Reed
said.

.“‘When Kong hits the nation it
will open in an unheard of 1200
theatres," Reed said.

The good movies rarely get
ﬁnanced. If so, no one goes, Reed
said. “People go to the movies
because of the size of the ads:”

“They actually have full page
ads for-Jaws, as if no one knows
about the movie,” Reed scoffed.

I don't know how we can get the
studios to produce good movies,
Reed said. “But if they ever do
we’ll all be so drunk on King Kong
cocktails we’ll never know it.”

. Sometimes I feel like the Ralph
Nader of consumer journalism,
Reed mumbled under his breath.

Appealing to the predominately
female crowd at the luncheon
benefit, Reed bemoaned the
dwindling role of women in today’s
movies. A-

“You can’t ﬁnd women with a
spy glass,” Reed said. “And what
was once romance in the movies is
now sex.”

Comedy of Powers

women in prominent roles, usually
as a love interest (as opposed to
mere decorative object). It's really
not such a radical idea.

Andjnow for a variation on the
old theme: boy meets girl. This.
time, boy doesn’t lose girl. Its the
otheriway around-—,after she kills
him. This is modern cinema.

Cornelia Sharpe (a delectable
object) is an “agent”'for person or
persons unkonwn who are desirious
of keeping Connery away from his
dream of a free Middle East.
The result is a confused,
muddledﬁlm, where four people
are murdered before the credits
end. and the rest of a large cast
meet similar ends before any sort
of characterizations can be made.
Connery is a humanitarian dreamer

RICHIE HAVENS

wardrobe that looks like it made up
the biggest item on the ﬁlm’s
budget.

The relationship between con-
troversial leader and assassin/
mistress could be interesting, but
Next Man never lets it get beyond
superﬁcialities. lt’s too busy being
glamorour, whizzing from one
exotic location to another, looking
more like a travelogue than a spy
thriller.

Another problem with the ﬁlm is
its hesitation to really say anything.
It likes to imply a lot about Soviet
and U.S. meddling in Middle East

affairs, but remains cooly coy in -

trying to explain anything that’s
happening on the screen. For all
the audience knows, it could be
exacting its revenge.

“Women have been reduced to
being something to jump on,”
Reed said.

Reed said as long as all the
power in movie administration is
held by men, women will not hold
the dominant roles as they once
did. ~
In the 40s and 50s the women in
real life couldn’t live up to the
image they had on screen, Reed
said. Today the screen characters
demean the image of the real
woman in society who is making
feminist advances.

“Female leads are playing either
whores, birdbrains or sex-starved
demonic ball breakers, because

they must depend on the men in-

administrative power for their
livelihood," Reed said.

“There are movies where women
play upstanding true-to-life roles,

but’ even women don’t go to see

them. ‘And if women don’t, men“
won’t," Reed concluded.

Reed also deplores the commer-
cial interruptions during the
television airing of Gone With The
Wind recently shown— on NBC.
“They chopped it to shreds," Reed
said. '

Reed said, “Networks rationalize
that the public expects commer-
cials, so they give them.

Reed said a new movie titled
Network is being made that blows
the lid ' off network clandestine
activities. “It's great."

Talking about his career, ‘
ten-year veteran of movie criticism

said he often feels like the only _

Nazi at a bar mitzvah.

“Actually I’m a little old man
trying to get out of a skiny frame,”
he quinned. A «

The first thing Pitt football coach
Johnny Majors talked about at the
weekly media luncheon on Wed-
nesday was last week’s West
Virginia game, which, as seen by an
assortment of yawns, sipped coffees
and uninterested drags from
cigarettes, was not exactly what the
reporters wanted to hear.

But when the talk came around to ‘

the bowls, ah yes...tablets and pens
popped out, tape recorders clicked
on and not a soul looked away from
Majors, as many had done only a
few moments earlier.

Everyone was looking for the
words of conﬁrmation from Majors
that the Panthers indeed had taken
a straw -vote among senior and
starting members of the squad
Tuesday evening and voted 20-8 in

favor of bypassing the Miami"

sunshine and a trip to the Orange
Bowl against the winner of the Big
Eight for Bourbon Street and the
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against
Southeastern Conference champ,

. Georgia, ranked sixth nationally in

the Associated Press weekly poll
with a 9-1 record.

“Our players set their course,”
Majors said, “and I’m ready to go
with them 100 percent. I'm going to
get on the same bus or the same
plane with them. They feel this is

  
   

Pitt quarterback Matt \Cavanaugh nonchalantly raises the ball in

their chance to play an opponent
that is highly-ranked and their
chance to also achieve a high
ranking.

“We haven't been invited
anywhere yet," continued Majors,
“but if we were, I wanted to get
their (the squad's) choice. I was
going with the squad regardless of
where they voted to go Tuesday
night."

Despite reports that the majority
of the players were leaning towards
the Orange Bowl prior to Tuesday’s
vote, most of the players’ minds did
an about face when Majors aired all
the possibilities of each bowl
game—especially, the prerequi-
sites of winning the national title,
Pitt‘s first since 1937 and the ﬁrst
for an Eastern team since 1959
when Syracuse turned the trick.

for than just a good trip,"_ Majors

reasoned over an obvious point. “A
trip like this is for the team and the
chance for them to do something
most of them will never have
another chance to do—and that's to
end up number one."

For sheer enjoyment and a
reward for an outstanding season,
what the players previously had in
mind was a few daysof beaches,
bars and babes in the Miami
sunshine. But an Orange Bowl
confrontation against a Big Eight
champion, which had lost twice
going into the battle on New Year's
Day, would not have enhanced the
chances for a national crown—what
the Panthers believed to be more
important than a week of fun.

The Big Eight is currently knotted
in a ﬁve-way tie between Iowa
State, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Okla-
homa state and Colorado, with a
three-way tie still pending after
tomorrow's games. The Panthers‘

needed to ﬁnd an opponent with a -

good record and a high ranking and
did justthat in a battle with Georgia
in the Sugar Bowl.

“Taking into account the possi-
bilities of what could happen this
week, " Majors said, “we decided to
take the calculated risk and go with
the team that has already made it to
the Sugar Bowl.

' “Before our team left (Tuesday's

'meeting), they made a motion to

make it unanimous, Majors
affirmed. ‘‘I don't think everyone in
this situation could be entirely
pleased." But we have not accepted
an invitation and neither has the

as

teani.

Just as the Panthers’ vote was
taken and preference announced
"unofficially” the Sugar Bowl
committee unofﬁcially extended its
bid to number—one ranked Pitt
Wednesday morning, though
NCAA rules specify the invitations
and acceptances cannot officially be
announced until 6 p.m. tomorrow.
But for now, it's Georgia.

"That's our decision, providing
we get the invitation," Majors said
slyly, unsuccessfully trying to put
one over on the media. “But we
needed to get it out of our system as
soon as possible, so we could begin
preparing for Penn State a week
from Friday (today).

“Our future is dependent on what
kind of attitude our team has in
approaching a post-season. But it's
a nice problem to have——certainly a
lot nicer than losing."

Female Hockey Teething

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

“People say, ‘You don't look

‘like a goalie!’ and I say, ‘What the

hell is a goalie supposed to look

like?’ ” Pitt senior Diane Darcy

remarked recently. “Then they
say, ‘But you still have all your
teeth!’ "_

By now, Darcy is used to
peoples’ reactions; she is the goalie
for the Pittsburgh Snow Bears, a
women’s hockey team. Prior to
joining the Snow Bears last season,
Darcy spent three years in the goal
cage of the Pittsburgh Pennies, a
more established women's team
that provides the sole competition
for her new club last season.

Ice hockey for women is a new
thing in the western Pennsylvania
area; in fact, the. only place it is
organized on a level similar to the
level men's hockey is in Canada.

“There are a whole lot of
factors,” Darcy explained. “Ice is
expensive. Ice time—-oh, God, I

to Buffalo and it’s only about $20. '

“Females don’t have the income
men do," she continued.
females aren’t sports oriented, not
like men are. It’s a new thing."

Darcy said that parents rarely
encourage their daughters to take
up hockey because of fear of injury.

The Snow Bears were formed
last year as a part of the North Park
American Hockey Association.
They compiled a dismal 0-8 record,
suffering all of their defeats at the
hands of the Pennies.

“I think there is a certain
feeling—-it’s not just another
team—-—it’s competitive because
you've played with them,” recalled
Darcy's teammate with both the
Pennies and Snow Bears, Joanne
Welch.

“They’d been playing ﬁve or six
years and they deserved to win,"
Welch continued, “even if it was us
they beat.”

Besides a losing season, the new
team has other problems‘. The
Bears pay a fee of $118 to play this

‘ ‘And’

season; last year, it was $50. the
team usually practices on week-
ends-—if ice is available. But the
biggest ‘problem is a lack of
players. Last year, the Snow Bears
had enough players for only two
lines which provided, Welch
estimated, only a two minute
break. Conversely, the Pennies
had six lines (this year, the team
has split into two separate squads)
and it made a big difference on the
ice.

“We'd play good in the opening‘
minutes and then we’d be so
tired,” Welch said. “If you ut out
your whole effort, you’re tired in
two minutes."

Darcy, as the team’s sole goalie,’
didn’t even get two minutes.

“I get the most action," she
said. “I don't think anyone knows
how exhausting it is."

Last season, Darcy lost a glove.
When she reached for the puck,
someone skated over her hand.

‘‘I said, ‘I'm bleeding! Stop the
game!’ " But Darcy could not be

I-lour-Long Lecture:
Soccer And Its Future-

BY JIM LEWIS
Assistant Sports Editor

Many people have asked me, “Why isn’t the soccer team winning?"

llley regret posing the question after an hour lecture.

lllere are many reasons why the Pitt soccer team didn’t pull a winning
season out of its magical hat, some of’ which aren't the fault of Coach Leo
Bemis and his crew. _

Bemis has just completed his 24th year at the Panthers’ helm. After
lllltlatlllg the varsity sport into the athletic system way back in 1952, he
has been ill charge ever since. There isn’t a more knowledgable coach
around. ‘

As tor the players, well, there’s talent on the field. However, it's no
secret that Pitt doesn't gouout with tistfuls of money to recruit the ﬁnest
lllgll school prospects in the land; these players are students, like you
and tile, whose first interest when applying was the University
ltsell—wlth college sports a strong secondary possibility. Since they
had the time and high school experience, they decided to try out. For a
team that ismade up of interested individuals—not recruits from all
ellds ol the earth which populate other college clubs—this is a pretty
good team. «

So why no winning record? There is no one glaring reason, but there
are several which contribute to the whole.

1) Recruiting. Pitt doesn't send scouts all over the country to look over
prospects like other colleges—Bemis doesn't have that kind of money.
rte lnust rely on catching wind of players’ reputations or expressed
desire to beconle a Pitt Panther in order to pursue a prospect.

Even when he hears of a top goal-scorer: or solid defenseman, there is
little he cali do but try to sell them Pitt. He usually fails (if you were
oliered a free education elsewhere, would you pass it up?).

“W eve slipped, in that we haven't put in as much money for
recruiting as our opponents do," Bemis said. i A .~ A
Wlllcll is strange, because int he mid-sixties, soccer was alive an
llvlllg lll heaps of dough at Pitt. From 1962 to 1965, the Panthers were

olle ol the best in the nation. '

2) I oath. Only three seniors will graduate~—backs Tom Murphy, Kim
Blasko, and Mark Gannon. All the rest (with the exception of Fred
uonrnlalnl and Frank Bucci) are freshmen or sophomores. In short, this
squad is frigllteningly young. P

.5) lniuries. "At tinles, we started to get it,‘.’ Bemis said sadly, “but
tllen a key player would get injured."

X es, injuries did hurt the Panthers all season long, and were a prime
reason for a 4- /-.5 year. Forwards Mark Nigh and Rich Roccon and goalie
Buccl were hampered with leg injuries of some nature. edd Zaring and
Jerry lonlassettl hosted knee and ankle problems all year, while Butch

lll.)ul'ClO was once’ the number one defensive backup-until he suffered
at concussion against the University of Cork. Not to mention little
nagging bumps and bruises each Panther sustained at least once this
SC&SOH.

4) practice space. It's a little tough to practice when you share a ﬁeld

w ltll the women‘s field hockey squad and baseball team—all at the same
line. _
"It was a sharing situation," Bemis claimed. "Next thing you know,
you only have an area the size of a postage stamp. You really can't see
vulat the players can do in a game unless you see them under game
eolldltlolls._ But we made the most of what we had.“

“It’s always been my dream to
play in the NBA, I hope everybody
back at Pitt understands, especially
the guys on the team. I just
couldn’t pass up the chance.”

These were the thoughts of Keith
Starr, former Pitt basketball
standout, now a rookie with the
National Basketball Association
Chicago Bulls. Starr watched from
the bench as the Cleveland
Cavaliers defeated the Bulls in the

106-95, at the Richﬁeld Coliseum in
suburban Cleveland recently.-

“My mother and father came up
from Sewickly to see my play, and I
just sat on the bench”, he
conﬁded.

But Starr won’t be on the bench
for long. A 6-7 swingman, he will
be worked into the Chicago lineup
gradually by new coach Ed Badger.

Uelclislvcly, the Panthers performed as expected——t'ough.

is deﬁnitely a ﬁne prospect, and
could be a real sleeper with our
club,” said Badger.

Starr passed up his ﬁnal year of
eligibility at Pitt this season to sign
with the Bulls, after having been a
fourth-round draft choice last
spring.

“Keith is_ a big guard with a"

pretty good shot. I think he’ll be
okay once he gets his feet wet,”
said Chicago’s all-pro guard and
defensive glue-man Norm VanLier,
an eight-year pro from nearby
Midland, Pa.

“Norm’s been a great help to
me,” responded Starr, “He’s
taken me under his wing, there’s so
much to learn up here. Norm’s
fantastic, ‘I learn from just watching
him.” _

Regarding the knee injury which
kept him on the sidelines last year,
Keith said, “It’s about 95 percent
now, I'm all right. . .

“I’m not sure what my position
will be, I’ve played as the
ballhandling guard, the second
guard, and the small forward, so
I’ll just have to wait and see.”

' While at Pitt, Keith established
records as the Panthers’ all time

career (329) and season (180) assist '

leader, and led the team in steals
with 114 two seasons ago.
“Tell the guys on theteam back

Pitt's cross-country ace, Mel
Boyd, will be traveling Saturday to
Denton, Texas, for the NCAA
cross-country championships at
North Texas State University.

The invitation came as no
surprise after Boyd’s ﬁne perfor-
mance this year. Boyd led the team
all year with individual wins at the

' California State Invitational (where
he set the course record), the West
Virginia diial meet and the
Kentucky, Ohio State and Cincin-
nati quadrangular meet. Boyd
ﬁnished a very respectable ﬁfth at
the tough Central Collegiate
Conference meet and ended the
regular season with a second plane
ﬁnish behind State’s All-American
George Malley in a dual meet with
Penn State.

Boyd thinks he can improve on
last year's 51st place at the
Nationals held at Penn State, where
he just missed All-American honors
in the six mile race.

McDonald is unquestionably the
band's most talented singer. On
“Without You," “Listen To The
Music," and “Long Train Run-
ning,” his voice was powerful and

rockin‘. During “It Keeps You
runnin’." he displayed his mel-
lower side.

Knudson came from behind his
kit on Sonny Boy Williamson’s
“Don't Start Me Talkin’,” and
camped it up to the hilt. Hartman
played a gigantic gong with a
flaming mallet on “For Someone
Special.” Plus, the two. of them
beat the skins with a passion the
whole night.

But these three couldn’t pull it off
by themselves.
Doobies pollute every song with
those dumb horns? It worked on the
funkier tunes, “Rio" and “Wheels
of Fortune," but destroyed the
songs that originally recorded
‘without a brass backing, “Jesus Is

"Just Alright With Me,” “Rockin’
Down the Highway," and “Eyes of

- . Silver."

Why did the '

.i

“never had a pair of skateson until
she put on her goalie skates,”
Welch says.

“It's not as rough as men's
hockey, but it’s rough," Welch
said.

“Who would think girls would do
things like that?” Darcy clowned.
“But we’ve had very few injuries.
We haven’t had anyone injured to
the point where they couldn’t play
the next game.” '

“What you need is the will to
try,” Darcy said. “You have to be
willing to get roughed, up, You
have to be willing to be bounced
around. You have to have the
desire to play.”

‘Their schedule is still tentative,

but the Snow Bears will probably‘

face squads from Cleveland, Erie,
and Toronto—“They (Canadians)
could even show the guys down
here something”—as well as the
Pennies. V _‘ —
It’ll be a long time before the
Snow Bears can prove themselves a
touch match to Canadian teams,
but at the rate hockey is growing in
Pennsylvania, it’s a safe bet that
Darcy won’t be questioned about
playing goalie much longer.

 Boyd Migrates

“I believe I can better my place
standing this year because I have
physically and mentally matured
from last year. lthink I am also in

better shape than last year at this

time, therefore 1 will be able to go
out with the_ leaders at the start of
the race and stay there.”

This strategy goes along with
Bo-yd’s race plan, which is to go out
in the top 30 and take it from there.
As for a prediction on where he will
ﬁnish, Mel couldn’t say.

“I will just try to do my best,” he
said.

You can't ask for more than that.

Running in the NCAAs is
climbing to the top of the mountain
for‘ college cross-country runners.
For Mel Boyd it is the second time to
the top so he will share an
advantage with a minority of the
other 250 runners at the Nationals.

If Boyd can continue to perform at
the NCAAs as he did all year he will
be a sure threat for a top place ﬁnish
and with that, the elusive All-
American status.

Doobie Bros.Sfdge Gimmicks

By the end of the night, more
people were clapping because they
recognized the songs; instead of
being moved by the electricity of the
band's music and delivery. -

Another problem in this night of
disappointment, was Boston’s can-
celling. Supposedly, their equip-
ment trucks broke down in transit
from San Francisco. And instead of
seeing the hottest new band in rock
n’ roll in their’ Pittsburgh concert

debut, people were forced to listen V

to Split Lips, a hard rock quartet
from Squirrel Hill.

If you like to hear shoddy,

renditions of Free’s seven-year-old
song, “Alright Now," Hear-t's
“Magic Man,” and Aerosmith's
“Last Child,” Split Lips is just the
bandto see. Scheduling them, even
with the late cancellation of Boston,
was an absolute disgrace. '
When people pay $7.50 a ticket to
see a show, they expect to see
professional musicians .perform.
Not some obscure band who would

_ have trouble cuttingiit in a bar.
