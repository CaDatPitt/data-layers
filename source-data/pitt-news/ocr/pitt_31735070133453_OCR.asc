Thousands of ‘Pitt fans made the trek to Orlando, Fla., to Watch as Pitt
trounced North Carolina State in the Dec. 20 Tangerine, Bowl.

Driven to victory:

Students, alumni

follow the Panthers to Florida win

, SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

On Dec. 18, close to 972 miles
and 30 degrees Fahrenheit separated
Pittsburgh from Orlando, Fla. But
by Dec. 21, thousands of Panther
fans —-‘ including hundreds. of Pitt
students — were basking in the
warm South Florida weather and
celebrating the Panthers’ first bowl
victory in 12 years.

At 12:30 p.m. on Dec. 18, the

Pitt Program Council was busy
loading 167 students onto three
chartered buses for the 19 1/2-hour
trip to the Visit Florida Tangerine
. Bowl. Students kept busy watching
movies, including “Road Trip,”

“Coyote Ugly’? and “Meet the
. Parents.” -
Senior and former SGB

President Mike Unangst said he did-
n’t mind the long bus ride, because

EPA fines Pitt for failingto register known carcinogens

9 ‘ JAMES DEWEESE
Senior Staff Writer .

The Environmental Protection Agency
ﬁned Pitt $25,300 for failing to register eight
on-carnpus electrical transformers, which
use a highly toxic,vprobable carcinogen as

coolant, according to a Jan. 4 press release. a

The citations stem from registration vio-
lations the University allegedly made before

it voluntarily replaced all the potentially-

toxic transformers.

The transformer units, which contained
polychlorinated biphenyl ﬂuid (PCBS), were
ﬁnally registered onApril 12, '2000.— more
than 16 months aﬁerthe Dec. ledeadline. Six
days‘ later, a routine EPA inspection deter-
mined that the Universityalso failed to ade-
quately label the vault containing the trans-
former units in Victoria Hall.

University spokesman Robert Hill said
the late ﬁling amounted to a “paperwork
oversight.” But, he said, “We discovered that

‘ ourselves, and then proceeded to properly

register them.” .
Hill declined to say which University

‘administration division was responsible for

 and registering the transformer
units. He said, “I would justbe general . . . it’s
the University’s responsibility.”

Hill said the University contracted an
outside consultant to perform routine inspec-
tions of the units, but he declined to identify
theﬁrm that completed the inspections. “I

‘don’t want to mention them publicly,” he
said ' .

‘The EPA’sApril 18 inspection “wasn’ta

surprise,” Hill said He addedthat atthe time

Administrators’ salaries onthe rise

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

The compensation committee of
Pitt’s Board of Trustees approved
new salaries for the University’s
high—ranking staff members last
month, and while many officers’
salaries were increased, the average

. increase was lower than in previous

years.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
was‘ granted a $17,500 raise,
increasing his salary to $342,500
for the 2001 to 2002 fiscal year.

That 5.4 percent raise is smaller

than last year’s raise of 6.6 percent,
as well as the previous year’s raise
of 6 percent.

The increase is also nearly one-
and-a-half times the rate of inﬂa-
tion for 2001 —- about 3.35 percent
—— according to the Economic
History Services company.

The compensation committee
began meeting annually in 1997.
Made up of all the members of the
Board of Trustees, the committee

has the task of deciding the ‘direc-

tion of the ,yearly salary of top
administrators. Nordenberg can rec-
ommend the addition of other mem-
bers to the committee, which would

then determine whether to expand

its membership to include the chan-
cellor’s recommendation,=
According to_ University
spokesman Robert Hill, the com-
mittee makes salary decisions based
upon the “performance of the previ-
ous year or by available funds.”
“[A salary] could go up, it could
go down, it could
remain the same,” Hill

said. _ Aﬁhurlﬂvine from his 13.2 percent"

Former Pitt
student’ s murder

trial postponed  

A new date has been set for the trial
of Matthew. Kaguyutan, a former Pitt
student charged with -murder in connec-

tion with a fire that killed Pitt student “

Joseph Marcinek on Sept. 29, 2000.

Marcinek was killed“ in the blaze
that consumed the North Craig Street
apartment building he shared with
Carissa‘ Probst, Kaguyutan’s ex-girl-
friend. A ,

According to Pittsburgh City
police, Kaguyutan admitted to setting
the fire in a jealous effort to reunite
with his former ‘girlfriend- Police also
allege‘ that shortly after the fire,
Kaguyutan sent a letter to Probst in
which he identiﬁed her as the intended
victim and expressed regret that she
had not died instead.

_Mike .Manko, director of public
relations for the Allegheny County dis-
trict attorney, said the trial — which

has been delayed twice — is now set to.
“begin July 9. Preliminary hearings are
scheduled for May 8 and 9 to determine

the validity of the defense’s claim that
Kaguyutan’s confession was coerced.

it gave him the opportunity to hang
out with other students and talk. He
estimated meeting about 10 students
traveling from Pitt’s various branch
campuses,’ including Greensburg
and Johnstown.

Buses unloaded at the_Ramada
Inn Resort in Orlando near 8 a.m.
the next morning. Pitt Program
Council Executive Board Director
Michelle Wydra said some students
then rented cars and opted to sched-
ule their own vacation time, while
others joined a — group trip to
Universal Studios or traveled to
other theme parks-in the Orlando
area.

the Program Council trip to Orlando
and then made his own way. He and
his friends visited Universal Studios
to try out the simulation rides, and
also spent time at the Universal City
Walk strip of bars and clubs at
night.

Unangst also visited the City
Walk attraction with friends, stop-
ping at the Bob Marley Cafe.'He
said he was impressed with the
number of Pitt students he saw,
given that Pitt students had “twice
the trip to travel than NC'State.”

Next door, at Universal’s Islands
of Adventure Theme Park, other stu-

dents attended the_ “Tangerine Jam,” 1

where Pitt andVNorth Carolina State
bands — and fans — competed to
make the most noise in the official
pep rally. The park remained open
only to Panther and Wolfpack fans
who spent the ’ night riding ‘the
Dueling Dragons ‘looping roller
coaster and dancing by the outdoor
bars.

While students on the PPC trip
were about to hit the town for din-
ner, class of 2000 alumnus Eric
Bubb was just leaving Pittsburgh
with his father and two friends.
Anticipating a long drive and a
noontime arrival at the -Caribe

Royale Resortgin ‘Orlando, Bubb

said he stayed up the night before
and slept for the first half of the trip

— which took his group just less "

than 15 hours in his parents’ minis-
van. In fact, Bubb arrived in
Orlando closes to 8:30 a.m.

On the way to the evening kick-
off on Dec. 20, Unangst, Mathews
and other students from the PPC- trip
stopped off for a pre-game party’ at
the Orlando Have a. Nice Day Cafe
before tailgating: '

Panther fans mingled with

Derek Mathews, a senior, took ,

Wolfpack supporters in the parking
lots outside the Citrus Bowl for bar-
becues, dancing and cheering.

After the Panthers’ victory, PPC
trippers —— clad in free blue and
gold “I Believe” T-shirts — returned
to downtown Orlando and. enjoyed
an hour-long open bar at Bar
Orlando before returning to the
Have a Nice Day Cafe.

Meanwhile, hundreds of other
fans packed the lobby of the team’s
hotel —— the same hotel where Bubb
and his companions were staying —
to cheer their entrance after the vic-
tory. A - '

Dec. 21 was reserved for recov-
ery for many.

“We laid low,” Bubb said. .

The 167 students traveling with
the PPC left for colder climes near
noon- By the time the group stopped
in Georgia for its first rest stop, the
temperature had already dropped.

“Everyone ran back in [the
bus],” Unangst said.

While they were closing in on
Pittsburgh in the early hours of Dec.
21, Bubb, his father and his friends

were just getting to bed. After a day
- of recovery, the group traveled to -

the Pat O’Brien’s bar at Universal’s
City Walk. Bubb‘ said O’Brien’s was
recommended to them because of its
reputation as “home of the
Hurricane” —, its signature . alco-
holic beverage. When Bubb discov-

ered that the price of thedrink '

included the decorative glass it
camein, he made a quick decision. ’

“[I decided to] go home with the
whole Pat O’Brien’s crysta1"set,” he
said. ‘

After installing his father as the
designateddriver, he and his friends
attempted to each collect the six dif-
ferent glasses ‘offered with eight of

Pat O’Brien’s special libations.
He did succeed in collecting all:

six, while hi_s friends came away
with five apiece. ‘
_“That got a‘ little ugly,” he said.
Before it .'was over, Bubbhad

paid a bartender $5 to wear his lime

green jacket around the bar and pose
for a picture in it. 5

By 6 a.m. Dec. 22, PPC buses
were back on campus. Wydra said

the temperature couldn’t have been

warmer than _12 degrees.
“People seemed to have agood
time,” she said. - ‘
Mathews and ‘Unangst agreed.
“I’d dotit again,” Mathews said. ’
“It went off without a hitch,”

Unangst said. “I’m thinking of dri-

ving south right now.”

of the inspection, the vault already carried a

Bonnie Smith, an EPA representative,
said accurate labeling becomes extremely

 important in emergency situations, where

rescue workers face potential exposure to
harmful chemicals such as PCBs.
Hill said the University voluntarily

replaced PCB—containing transformers in _

Victoria Hall and other locations around
campus in August 2000 with newer models

[that do not contain PCBs. According to Hill,

there are no longer any transformers on

According to the EPA Web site,
www.epa.gov, many scientists and health‘
organizations, including the World Health
Organization, have_linked PCBs to develop-

mental problems and certain types of cancer. , ’

.PCBs tend to accumulate in living
organisms . over time. Apart from direct
exposure, PCBs can also enter the food

’ chain through river and soil contamination.
,PCBs frequently serve as coolants, ﬁre pre-

ventatives and insulators in devices such as
electrical transformers because they elfec—
tively resist extremely high temperatures.

Though the federal government barmed
the production of new PCBs in 1979, Smith
said they remain commonvthroughout the
United States. The EPA maintains a registry
of PCB—containing devices still in use

Both Hill and Smith stressed that the
$25,300 ﬁne represents an EPA recommen-
dation based on the EPA’s allegations and ‘
that the University has the right to right to

« request a hearing.

Hill said the University has not deter-
mined whether it will contest the ‘ﬁndings

Students resolve to kick the bad habits

KATE LAUGHLIN
Staff Writer

Dealing with the all too com-
mon New Year’s Day hangover gave
many Pitt students renewed incen-
tive to keep their New Year’s reso-
lutions, which, for the most part,
followed a familiar pattern.

Like many preceding it, this
New Year’s laundry list of things to
cut down on or quit altogether
sounds like a secular version of
Lent. Junk food, smoking and
promiscuous behavior repeatedly
came up as vices students wished to
eliminate.

“My smoking is one of the
things I like least about myself,”
senior Brian Hall said. “And this
isn’t the first time I’ve tried to
quit.”

Hall is not alone in his attempt
to purify his blackened lungs. Dr.
Shirley Haberman of Pitt’s Health
Education office said that at the
beginning of the new year the office
always sees an inﬂux of new partic-
ipants to its “Quit Using Irritating
Tobacco” program.

“We’re hoping to set up a table
on campus to encourage students to
make good on their resolutions,”
she said.

Student Health’s Q.U.I.T pro-
gram does not require an initial
appointment and consists of several
sessions with a counselor and
access to free nicotine patches.

Sales of consumer products to
aidin the quitting process also
increased in the first week‘ of
January, according to Pitt student
and Rite Aid employee gBrian
Burgess.

“The nicotine gum seems to be

more popular than the patch this

year, but there’s a definite increase
in both,” Burgess said. _

Along with students who want
to quit smoking, Haberman said stu-

Education office each January.
There they can meet with a dietitian
who will help them learn to eat
right and loseweight. .
Unfortunately the frigid temper-
atures and icy streets of Oakland
provide an easy excuse to forego
"outdoor exercise as a means of get-
ting in shape. This is especially true
for students such as senior Katie
Murphy who live in the depths of
South Oakland, where just hiking
up to Trees Hall can feel like climb-
ing the first leg of Mount Everest.
“My resolution was to start run-
ning again every day, but it’s so
cold and slippery,” Murphy said.
“And it’s a huge effort just to get to

the gym from my apartment on

Dawson Street.”

On a different note but possibly"

just as difficult a resolution to keep

is senior Rob White’s resolution.
“I’m going to deflate my

blowup doll,” he said."‘For good.”
-T he repeated failure of the same

resolution is .a frequently expressed '

problem among resolution makers.
Hall addressed the problem,
saying, “Everyone always thinks
they are going cut back something
like drinking, smoking or eating for

  Steel City sports teams  
bringing back glory days

Perhaps this decade the moniker
“City of Champions” will retum' to
Pittsburgh.

On Dec. 20, the Pitt _football team
beat the North Carolina State Wolfpack
34-19 in the Visit Florida Tangerine
Bowl. This marks the first bowl victory
for Pitt since the 1989 John Hancock
Bowl. It’s also head coach Walt Harris’
first bowl victory.

Congratulations to the Panthers on a
phenomenal performance.

And more importantly, Pitt fans
showed up in droves to cheer the team to
victory. We should all be proud that so
many made the trek, especially since the
journey from Pittsburgh to Orlando, Fla,
is much longer than the one from North
Carolina. -

Even better, those who showed up
went wild. Unlike games at Heinz Field,
where at some moments the silence is
deafening, the Pitt section kept the vol-
ume cranked the entire time. The fans
showed the enthusiasm that should be
normal for every game.

Although the Tangerine Bowl is con-
sidered a less-prestigious bowl, that did
not seem to matter to the fans and the
team. Following the victory, Pitt fans
waited in the lobby of the hotel for the
team to return and congratulated them.
While other schools scoff at any non-

. Bowl Championship Series game, Pitt

was clearly happy to be there — as we
should be. A bowl game is a bowl game,
and by playing in it the program received
a big boost. As the ESPN commentators
noted during the game, this should great-
ly help recruiting. Games such as the
Tangerine Bowl should remain in place.
But the football team is not the only
team that brought pride to Pitt. After a
victory over Boston College on Saturday,
the men’s basketball team broke into the
top 25 for the ﬁrst time since 1998. We

would like to congratulate them as well,‘
and we look forward to even greater.

accomplishments. .
, And Pitt’s teams are not the only ones
allowing Pittsburghers to hold their heads
high. In two weeks, the Steelers will host
a playoff game at ‘Heinz Field after ﬁnish-
ing with the best record in the AFC and
snapping a streak of three playoff-less
years. Many sports commentators predict
the Steelers will reach the Super Bowl, to
be played in New Orleans on Feb. 3.
Let’s hope their predictions come
true. After all, the only city better for a
bowl game than Orlando — whether it is

a college bowl or the Super Bowl — is-

New Orleans. Pittsburgh sports are once
again giving us reason to be proud. To
quote Pitt football wide receiver Antonio
Bryant, “let’s keep the party going.”_

Apalled by sprawl -

The small Illinois town where I was
born bears the seemingly absurd name of

Sandwich. In my memory, Sandwich V

was a cornﬁeld oasis. “Downtown” con-
sisted of about three stores and a diner.
All around us was ... corn. It was every-
thing a little town with a funny‘ name
should be.

But on each trip I’ve made to"

Sandwich in the 13 years that I’ve lived
in Pennsylvania, those com- .

Americans aspire, and in part, I buy into
it too. If I still lived in Sandwich, I’m
sure I would have been grateful for that
strip mall — and patronized it happily
and frequently. The place I now call
home is a suburb of Harrisburg, and
while I don’t want to return there after
graduation, it was an enjoyable place to
grow up. . 1

But you certainly don’t have to trav-

el to Illinois to witness suburban sprawl. .

Last semester in my urban studies class,
we learned that most Pennsylvania cities,

including Pittsburgh, have lost one-half

to one—third of their population since the

1950s. The state’s population has also '

declined during this time. Yet evidence
of sprawl —‘ new houses being built on

’ previously undeveloped land —— is still

rampant in virtually all parts of the state.

So is this a bad thing?

Many would argue that it’s not.
Suburban affluence is what we see in the
movies, on television and in magazines.

Don’t give me a home where the mini—malls roam

Bowen, page 10

Corporation, established in the 1930s as part of New
Deal legislation, favored loans to people who wanted to
build new houses in suburban areas, but immigrants and
minorities living in inner-city ghettos could not usually
obtain loans to repair their homes. The Federal Housing
Administration, when it was first established, blatantly
refused to guarantee loans to non-white Americans.

While discrimination in housing‘ based on race and
ethnicity does continue to occur, Title VIII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1968 outlawed such practices. But zoning
policies, in large part, continue to support residential
segregation on the basis of class.

In sprawl communities, homes can be zoned for_ .

minimum square footage. This beneﬁts the developers,
who make more money selling larger luxury homes.
But such policies clearly hinder the development of
mixed—income communities — the building of smaller
homes, townhouses or apartments interspersed with
larger single—farnily homes. « r

The nonexistence of economic diversity is not
unique to sprawl communities. In Pittsburgh, I have
friends and neighbors who are black, \white, Asian,
Middle Eastern, gay, straight, Catholic, Protestant,
Hindu, Muslim, Jewish — but almost all of them, like
me, are from rniddle-class families.

But at least in cities, there’s hope. Everyone in your
apartment building may be middle class, but across the
sweet there could be a large single—family home, or a
row of old brick rowhouses. You’re forced to know
your neighbors when they live 20 feet away from you,
and you look out for each other. You can walk to the
drug store, or take public transportation.

I am not so sure about America’s new dream: the

‘The Royal Tenenbaums’ takes an endearing
look at our sometimes wacky geneaology

The Royal Tenenbaums

Starring Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow,gBen Stiller, Anjelica
Huston, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Danny Glover

Directed by Wes Anderson
‘£r7’.‘r7.“r1/2

NICHOLAS ZINOBILE
Staff Writer

As the opening music of Wes
Anderson’s new ﬁlm “The Royal
Tenenbaums” hums quietly but sweep-
ingly along to “Hey Jude,” you can’t
help wondering, despite a title card
declaring “prologue,” just exactly where
you’re being taken.

The audience meets a family of
three children mothered by Etheline
Tenenbaum (Angelica Huston), literally
a “Family of Geniuses”——she wrote a
book about it. Chas (Ben Stiller),

Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Richie
(Luke Wilson) Tenenbaum, raised in a
spacious townhouse in a slightly mythi-
cal New York City, grow up to various
thwarted successes.

.. Chas becomes a self-sufﬁcient mil-
lionaire with two sons of his own, but
his wife was killed in a plane crash.
Margot grows up dealing with the con-
stant childhood reminder that she is an
adopted Tenenbaum, and despite » the
brilliance of several plays she wrote as a
child, she has never quite found happi-
ness in anyone or anything but her
brother Richie.

Richie, . natural

second
Tenenbaum son, became a tennis star,"
but later suffered a nervousbreakdown
on national television. He went into
exile on a ship somewhere in the
Atlantic, because of — unbeknownst to
anyone —— his love for his adopted sister.

the

Royal Tenenbaum
(Gene Hackman) is the
father of all this dysfunc-
tion, and he suddenly
appears in their lives once
again, claiming to be nearing death, and

supposedly there to make amends for

the misdeeds of his negligent father-
hood.

That’s just the setup.

With “The Royal Tenenbaums,”
Wes Anderson continues his subtle and
mystifying method of character creation,
as we’ve previously seen with Dignan in
“Bottle Rocket” and Max Fischer in
“Rushmore.” “The Royal Tenenbaums,”
however, presents an exponentially larg-
er cast of characters. Anderson’s script,
which he co-wrote with Owen Vlfilson,
displays the sort of obsessive detail that

C V to “Magnolia,” the family
wa opus by that other pesky

we’ve come to expect, though brought
to an even higher level here; imagine the
rundown of Max’s achievements in
“Rushmore” to the tenth degree.

- Also, though it may easily be seen
as a New York movie ‘in the vein of
Woody Allen, “Tenenbaums’.’ is also rec-

- ognizable in its similarity

Anderson, Paul Thomas.
, The ' difference is that
“Tenenbaums” focuses on its one family
while “Magnolia” reaches further to tie
coincidence and ‘happenstance together
to create some sort of overarching bond
of humanity. But the elements of guilt
and redemption and forgiveness are all
here.

But indeed, “The i Royal
Tenenbaums” _weaves a tale that,_ like
any family, cannot and does not
armounce its direction or intent. It’s a lot
to take in, and really’ must be seen to be
understood. Even if you don’t under-
stand it, just try to remember any family
tree that you could make sense of.

Sting was immune to the

mous Tuesday,. Sting and his band
conferred about what do after hearing
the news from America.

In the end, they resorted to the

De La Soul delivers second  

installment in AOI trilogy

BRANDON YNOCENCIO
The Pitt News

After 13 years in the music business, De La Soul
still produces quality material. Their most recent
release, Bionix, is the second installment of the A01, or
Art Oﬁicial Intelligence trilogy. .

The trio~from, Long Island brings the familiar De

' La formula to-their sixth album. If you’re already farnil-

iar with De La you should know what to expect — and
that is basically what you get. .

Voeally, members Posdnuos (aka ,Kevin Mercer)
and Dave (aka David Jolicoeur, formerly known as
Trugoy) both have direct and tight delivery.
The lyrics are, for the most part, simple but
good, and the band treats them with a posi-
tive slant. Honesty, humor and a touch of
cockiness guide the lyrical direction.

Production comes mostly from Dave West —P
drums over looped samples; it’s simple but effective.
Some of the other producers include Jay Dee (Slum
Village), Megahertz (“Bad Boy For Life”) and De La
themselves.

Listen

There are a variety of sounds represented on the
album. “Watch Out” features a Latin ﬂavor courtesy of

a. Cal Tjader break. and some additional vocals by
Periquo Fernandez. “Held Down,” which features Cee-
Lo of Goodie Mob, has a gospel feel and
has a nice soulful organ as De La drops
introspective lyrics dealing with the issue
of others trying to hold you down.

The lead single, “Baby Phat” has
become somewhat of a hit for a lot of ladies who can
relate ‘— it’s an anthem for women on the thicker side
of things. It’s certain to go over well in a club at1nos-
phere. A couple of the other joints on Bionix should be
able to keep a party moving as well.

Are you between 18 and 40=years of age?

If so, you may be able to participate in a research study.

The standout cut has to be the last track on the
album, “Trying People.” The song has a call and
response hook that includes a chorus of “li’l people
wanting to try” to go along with its words of inspira-
tion.

The album has its ﬂaws. One, it’s too short. Also,
the production is good but not great. This album is very
good by today’s rap standards but it’s not as good as De
La’s previous releases.

Hip—hop fans will enjoy Bionix because it’s a feel-
good album — even though this is not their best work.
De La hasn’t lost it, though, and perhaps the group will
be able to deliver another classic when the last leg of
the A01 trilogy comes around.

Rockstar Games fails

to deliver the goods

Smugg|er’s Run 2: Hostile Territory
For Playstation 2
Rockstar Games
it ‘ p
KENNETH PAUL
Contributing Editor

Following the huge success of Rockstar Games’
“Grand Theft Auto_3,” the game company released its
second high-speed title, “Smuggler’s Run 2.”

In the company’s_ second
“Smuggler’s Run” effort, “Smuggler’s
Run 2” fails, to bring the well—rounded
assortment of graphics, strong plot and
exciting game play that its predecessor
displayed.

The off-road racing game, which is the self—pro—
claimed “ultimate off-road driving adventure,” has the
game player working for smugglers by delivering an
array of contraband while escaping authorities and
rivals.

“Grand Theft Auto 3,” which is one of this year’s
hottest games, is so successful because game players
really have to outthink their foes on each mission. The
plot grows throughout the game because you are con-
stantly working for new corrupt entities. By contrast,

Zap

“Smuggler’s Run 2” just doesn’t have the same com-

plex challenges to keep you coming back.

The game begins with a full motion video scene
introducing you to the plot of the game and the video
scenes are intertwined throughout the missions. The
game play is very straightforward as you drive over
contraband, which is highlighted for your conve-
nience with yellow and red zones. Once you have
picked up the product(s), you must make a drop off at
a speciﬁc point. p

' These missions are very repetitive. The only real
difference between the missions are the vehicles that
range from a buggy to military tanks that can be
unlocked throughout the duration of the game as well
as the increasingly difﬁcult terrains to overcome in
Russia and Vietnam. V

When the police get on your tail in
the “Grand Theft” title, a good strategy is
needed to shake them because they will set
barricades and follow you with a helicopter.
But while dropping off contraband in
“Smuggler’s Run,” it is not all that difﬁcult to escape
the men in blue, because all they do is smash into you.

There really is no strategy in losing the police as
the key.to the game is racing back to the checkpoints.
This feature quickly becomes trite as the game lacks a
change of pace.

If you absolutely love racing games and time tri-
als then this might be the game for you, but if you’re
expecting another strong performance from the com-
pany that put out the wild “Grand Theft” title, you will
most likely be disappointed.

Curiosity rewarded.

Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique Challenges of Life in Your

 ' ‘LESLIE HOCFFMI " '  "
A&E Editor

Our culture readily recognizes —
and may seem to embrace — the phe-
nomenon of the mid—life crisis.
Commonly recognized in
middle-aged men, we glibly
smile" at our “suffering”

crises by purchasing snappy
sports cars.

In their book, “Quarterlife Crisis:
The Unique Challenges of Life in Your
Twenties,” Alexandra Robbins and
Abby Wilner protest, however, that
before we reach our mid-life crisis, we
encounter a “quarterlife crisis” during
our twenties. '

. Alexandra Robbins and Abby Wilner 6 6 «»

Throughout “Quarterlife Crisis,”
the reader encounters multitudes _of

interviews with other twentysome-

things, identiﬁed by their first name, age
and place of matriculation. At first, the
interviews are interesting. Robbins and

VV11ner have been careful to

interview in all encompass-

though you were listening to anyone on
the street. .
After a while, _though, the inter-
views begin to bog you down. They
seem to follow a pattern: Graduate from
college, achieve dream, question self,
deep depression.

settled down,
a_ quarterlife
crisis occurs
because of the
vastly unstruc-
tured and unset-
tled lives young
p e o p 1 e
encounter after
college gradua-
tion. '
Their theory '

does seem valid;
after twenty years
of schooling in a
structured environ-
ment, following

college, the road to success — however
you deﬁne it —— doesn’t even have a
road map.

Robbins and Wilner say that the rea-
son the term “quarterlife crisis” hasn’t
yet been coined is because nobody has
acknowledged the roller coaster of chal-
lenges twentysomethings encounter.
They say that many twentysomethings
fear that their concerns and doubts are
unique to them, so nobody talks about
this intense period of self—questioning.

But maybe that’s the point of the

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS ,

F‘.

Panther linebacker Lewis Moore sacks N.C. State quarterback Philip Rivers in the fourth quarter

fumble 16 yards for the touchdown as the*Panthers claimed a’ 34-19 victory.

Panthers pounce on the Pack

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

Perhaps it’s only fitting that the
ending to the Panthers’ fairy-tale

turnaround this season came in the '

city of magic. _

Pitt won its sixth straight contest
by defeating North Carolina State
34-19 in the Tangerine Bowl on Dec.
20 in Orlando, Fla. A crowd of 28,
562 filled the Florida Citrus Bowl
stadium to witness the Panthers
rebound from a 1-5 start to end the
season at 7-5.

“This is a special team and
always will be because we fought
back from the most adversity that
I’ve been involved with,” head
coach Walt Harris said. _

Wide receiver Antonio Bryant lit
up the field, recording seven catches
for 101 yards and two touchdowns, a
performance that earned him the
honor of most valuable player.

Bryant, was also named Pitt

offensive‘ MVP despite playing at

less than 100 percent: Plagued by
ankle problems all season, Bryant
was notgoing to sit out what will
likely beihis last collegiate game.

As he was presented with the
MVP trophy, Pitt fans chanted, “One
more year!” to encourage Bryant to
return to‘Pitt‘next season instead of
going to the NFL.

“He showed people why he was
the Biletnikoff Award winner a year
ago,” said N.C. State head coach
Chuck Amato. “He’s a great player
and he’s their go-to guy, and they
were going to him.”

But the defense can be credited
with the turning point of the game
— a fumble by Wolfpack quarter-
back Philip Rivers after he was
sacked by linebacker Lewis Moore
with 6:15 remaining in the game.
The ball was recovered by Tyre
Young and returned 16 yards for his
first career touchdown to put Pitt up
by the final of 34-19 ’and quell

chances of an N.C. State comeback.
“I knew I was going to come free
to make the sack,‘ and after I saw
Tyre pick up the ball and go to the
end zone, it was just like, ‘wow,”’
said Moore, who earned Pitt defen-
sive MVP honors. “It was a big
break and it felt really good.”
Quarterback David Priestley
also put in a solid performance com-
pleting 18-of-32 for 271 yards and
two touchdowns. Fellow senior R.J.

English, who led the Big.East in’

receiving yards per game with 69.1
this season, finished with five catch-
es for 76 yards. The running game
was led by fullback Lousaka Polite,
who had nine carries for 63 yards.

The Panthers came out early on,
scoring first on a 27-yard field goal
by Nick Lotz. After N.C. State tied
the game, Pitt opened up a 14-point
lead with consecutive touchdowns
by Bryant.

“The thing I respect the most
about this team [Pitt] was that they

were ready to play,” Harris said.
With less than four minutes left
in the half, N.C. State’sj Gregory
Golden returned a kickoff 90 yards
to pull the Wolfpack within 7, 17-
10. But on Pitt’s next drive, Polite
rushed 35 yards to set up a 1-yard
touchdown; run by backup quarter-
back Rod Rutherford. ' —
The Wolfpack had just 55 pass-

-ing yards in the first half compared

to 208 by the Panthers.

“We didn’t move the ball consis-
tently,” Rivers said, “They did
exactly what we expected them to
do, exactly what we worked on. We
just didn’t make enough plays.”

The Panthers opened scoring in I

the second half with a 33-yard Lotz
field goal, extending their lead to
27-10. Once again‘ the Wolfpack

Bryant leads Panthers’
offense, earns honors

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

The NFL scouts watched and Pitt’s
Antonio Bryant put on a show as the
junior wide receiver pulled in seven

in _ catches for 101 yards and two», touch-

downs in the team’s 34-19 victory ‘over
North Carolina State in the Tangerine
Bowl. ~
Bryant, hampered by an ankle injury
he suffered three weeks earlier in a game
against Alabarna-Birmingham, did not
‘let the impairment hamper his perfor-
mance.

“I’d probably say that I was at 80
percent but coach would say that I was at
65,” Bryant said after the game.

Bryant said that he knew that the
N.C. State defenders would be looking
for him to hobble around in the ﬁrst half
and that he’d just have to push through
the pain, and push through he did.

The 6-foot-2-inch, 185—pound
receiver became active early as hemade
a 17-yard grab to help set up a ﬁeld goal

I to give Pitt a 3-0 lead.

After running backs Marcus Furman
and Raymond Kirkley made big recep-
tions out of the backﬁeld, Bryant hauled
in a 15-yard pass from David Priestley
for a touchdown, giving the Panthers a
10-3 advantage.

On Pitt’s very next possession, N.C.
State comerback jJ.J. Washington inter-

1

fered with Bryant, yet Bryant managed

. to reel in a difﬁcult 49-yard reception. He ‘
. capped the drive off with a more modest

two-yard grab to put Pitt ahead, 17-3.
Bryant, who won the Biletnikoff
Award last season as the nation’s top

‘ receiver, ﬁnished the game as Pitt’s all-

time leader in career receiving yards with

3,061, passing Dietrich Jells’ previous '-

mark of 3,003. yards. His 30 career
touchdown catches are also a Pitt best.
“He showedpeople why he was the

Biletnikoff awards winner a year ago,”

N.C. State head coach Chuck Amato
said. ‘Thank God he had a bad ankle or
he would have really embarrassed us._”
Bryant, who was named the bowl’s
Most Valuable Player, was hit with sev-
eral questions regarding his future, but

Bryant did not lead onto whether or not-
he’d forego his senior season for the ’

NFL.

When he was asked what reason
there might be for him to stay, he replied,
“I never said ‘that I was‘ leaving.”

But yesterday’s Pittsburgh ’Post- i

Gazette reported that Bryant has told Pitt
thatnhe will enter the NFL draftiin April.
He is projected as a ﬁrst-rounddraft pick
and with no proven quarterback remain-

ing on the team for next season, it is.

unlikely that he would remain at Pitt.

“My scholarship is for four years
and I like playing college football,” he
said.

Junior Brandin. Knight has emerged as the leader of the 14-1 men’s basketball
team. The team is ‘nationally ranked for the first time in three years.

PitttopsNo. 11 Eagles,
earns national ranking  

J_oE MARCHILENA 
Staff Writer '

For the first time since Ben
Howland became Pitt’s basketball
coach, the Panthers are ranked, thanks
to their 77-74 win over then-No. 11
Boston College Saturday night in
Chestnut Hill, Mass. 7

The Panthers improved to 14-1
overall and 2-0 in the Big East, and are
among the top 25 teams in the nation
for the first time since Dec. 1998. The
Associated Press has the Panthers
ranked 23rd, while the USA
Today/ESPN poll has Pitt at No. 25.

Led by Brandin Knight’s 20 points

, and seven rebounds and a team defense

that held Troy Bell, the Big East’s lead-
ing scorer, to zero points in the first
half, Pitt was able to snap Boston
College’s 25-game winning streak at
Conte Forum.

The loss was the Eagles’ first at

home since Pitt defeated them 70-60 on
Feb. 23, 2000.

“It’s a big start to our season,” said
Howland; “Winning on the road is

always difficult and [beating] one of the
best teams in the country. is extra spe-
cial.” , »

“When we go into the game, we
don’t worry too much about the fans,’7
Knight said about playing a ranked
team on the road. “Everyone laces them
up the same way. It’s ﬁve—on-ﬁve once
you’re out there.”  ' ‘ .

Despite missing all seven shots in
the first half, Bell still led the Eagles
with 23 points, going 10 for 11 from the
free throw line. '

“I knew that after [Bell] scored zero
points, he was V going to come out
stronger and -1 knew’ it was going to be
tougher _in the second half,” said Julius
Page, who spent most of the night
guarding Bell. -

.“Bell was still getting his shot
attempts, he just wasn’t hitting them,”
added Knight. “He got [his points] from
the free throw line. We can’t help that.”

The Panthers held Boston College
to just 41 percent shooting from the
ﬁeld, while hitting 51 percent of their

The football team’s last-second
loss at Penn State in 1999 and the
overtime loss at Syracuse in 2000
made Pitt fans question if they’d ever
see the light.

God bless 2002. It’s a new year
that could very much push Pitt back
toward the light and away from the
other “L” word —— losing. ..

The football team is the best in the
state and finished with a six-game
winning streak. The team really will
not be losing many starters and will
be adding some star recruits, includ-
ing quarterback Tyler Palko and cor-
nerback/safety Josh Lay, who is
enrolled for this semester.

Throughout its final 15 years, Pitt
Stadium was the host to many Pitt
losses, but future. seasons at Heinz
Field should be different. Another
new stadium, the Peterson Events
Center, looks like it will be hosting a
winner too next season.

Unlike the football team, Pitt’s
basketball team received little to no
preseason recognition. It was viewed
as a" team with little experience and
size. But the basketball team is out to
its best start in almost 30 years.

Since the start of the season, head
coach Ben Howland said that this

year’s team had the best chemistry of
any team that he’s coached and he
wasn’t jiving us. This is a fun team to
watch that loves to play defense.
Point guard Brandin Knight dom-
inates the games, while his counter-
part Julius Page has consistently shut
down the opposing team’s top scorer.
The round Ontario Lett is as funda-
mentally sound as they get in the paint
and if he can keep his fouls down,
then Pitt will be an even better team.
Everyone is doing their part,
which led to Pitt’s mastering: of the
shot clock and tempo of each game.
Now that we’re all back, let’s
hope the basketball team will still be
able to keep its cool and do as well as
it did when we were away. Saturday’s
game against Notre Dame is sold out
but there are still tickets available for
future games, including Syracuse,
Georgetown, Villanova and Seton

' Hall.

It‘ looks as though the sports pro-
grams are on the rise, and I hope this
will be the year that will put Pitt back
on the map. Knock on wood.

Kenneth Paul is the sports editor for _

The Pitt News and believes that they
still need to put more troughs in‘the

receiver Dovonte Edwards for the
touchdown.

The extra point attempt by Adam
Kiker was blocked, but N.C. State
closed the gap on a field goal with
less than ten minutes remaining. The
fumble recovery by Young sealed
the victory for the Panthers. _

“You have to give credit to the
University of Pittsburgh. They came
here and they were hungry,” -Amato
said. “Pitt just kept fighting and
fighting and fighting.”

Rivers, who finished the game
26-of-40 for 189 yards, a touchdown
and an interception, was named N.C.
State’s offensive MVP. The defen-
sive MVP honoriwas split between
defensive tackle Terrance Martin
and middle linebacker Dantonio
Burnette.

Willie Wright led the offense
with eight catches for 61 yards’
while Ray Robinson had 10 carries
for 51 yards.

The game marks the eighth
meeting between Pitt and N.C.
State, which includes ‘the

the loss drops N.C. State to 7-5 on

Thexwin marks the first bowl
victory for Harris since he came to
Pitt in 1997, and the first for the
Panthers since they defeated Texas
A&M in the John Hancock Bowl in
1989.

“We battled and it was a tremen-

shots and 70 percent of their free

throws- Donatas Zavackas added 17'
points for Pitt, converting 75 percent of _

his foul shots, including 7 of 10 in the
ﬁnal ﬁve minute_s of the game. Jaron

Brown added 15 points and seven .

rebounds, while Page scored 11. »

“I can’t say enough about our guys
making foul shots,” said Howland. “I
really was concerned heading into
league [play]. We’ve done a lot more
work on it and they’ve stepped up and
answered the call.” ' '

Pitt started the game quickly, jump— '-

ing out to a seven-point lead following
a three-point play by Page with just
more than 14 minutes remaining in the
ﬁrst half.

-The Eagles jumped-back "into the
game, going on a 15-5 run to take a
three-point lead, Boston College’s only
lead ofthe game. A .

The Panthers responded with a run
of their own, scoring 11 of the ﬁnal 16

v . points in the half to take a 29-26 lead at

the break. ' -A
The second half startéd much like

the first, with\Pitt jumping out to its‘

largest lead of the game with 14-6 run
to take a 43-35 lead with 13 minutes
left in the game. Both teams traded bas-
kets for the next six minutes with Bell
scoring 13 of the Eagles’ next 16
points. Pitt still held an eight-point lead
following Page’s three with 7 minutes,
57 seconds left to play.

Page followed his three with a two-

handed dunk along the baseline that -

silenced, the crowd and put Pitt up 59-
51.

“We knew how big and strong and '

physical they were last year, so we had
to come out here prepared,” said Page.
“Everybody was focused and a play
like that is going to get everybody
excited.” E . 

“Page had two [big plays] ina row,

which was a huge turning poi‘nt for us,” _

Howland said. , _
The Eagles came back, going on a
13-4 run, cutting the Panthers’ lead to

. two with 2:22 left. Pitt was able to hold
 on, beating the Eagles’ press and con-

verting 12 of 1"8 free throws in the final
minutes to seal the victory.

“It’s’ a huge win, but we still. have
14 games left,” Howland said. “You

can’t get toohigh after a big win like. i

this, although it’s'hard.”
“Every win gives you more conﬁ-

- dence,” said Knight. “Right now every-

one is happy with this win, but we’ve
got to come back and win the [next
one].” '
