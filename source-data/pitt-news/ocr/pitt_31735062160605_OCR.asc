“One of the basic problems in
education today,” Chancellor
Litchﬁeld pointed out, “is the
. need for an educational system
Which_ can produce not only
more scientists but better trained,
individuals‘ in all areas. We
have an unparalleled opportu-

Nancy White Now
Home Economist
Group Counselor

By ROSALIE GLAND
" One of the more recent ad-

'ditions to the ofﬁce of the

Dean of Women is Miss
Nancy White who is now in
the middle of her second year
as an Assistant to the Dean.

The tall, slender, and blond as-
sistant dean was born and raised
in Kitanning, Pennsylvania where
she became an honor student at
the local high school.

Upon graduation Miss White at-
tended Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity where she majored
economics education. “I
chose Penn State because I al-
ways wanted to go to a large
schoo1,‘and many members of my
family went _there,” she stated-

Stayed Away

Remarking on the fact that Pitt
and Penn State are big rivals,
Miss White said, “Last year I
didn’t attend the Pitt-Penn» State
game because I didn’t know whom
to root for.”

Following her graduation in
1954 she entered department
store work. She was a member
of Kaufman’s Training program
for one year. s

“It had its possibilities,” she
commented, “but you have to
really enjoy a job to succeed in
it. My real ambition was to
teach.” Thisambition was realiz-
ed, for the following year she
taught home economics at Kit-
anning High School.

Call From Rush

It was at this point in her career -

that she received her biggest
boost. “I ‘received a phone call
from Miss Rush who offered me
a position as Assistant to the
Dean, speciﬁcally to handle the
home economics program here.”
The twelfth ﬂoor is the home-
making education center. The.

program under Miss White’s di-
rection emphasizes informal
teaching. I

Here, Pitt women are given the
opportunity for self—expression,
creativeness, making of invita-
tions, cooking, table setting, plan-
ning menus and many other

lhomemaking techniques.

“I ﬁnd it fascinating. All wo-
men are potential homemakers. I
believe the art of homemaking
can make or break a home.”

In addition to these duties,
Miss White, leads three- fresh-
men seminars, does individual
and group counseling, is advisor
to the senior class, AWS social
committee, and the 12th floor
committee. ‘

Summer ﬁnds her on a golf
course trying to improve her
score." She is a beginning ski en-
thusiast and plans to spend many
weekends on the Laurel Moun-
tain slopes. Other than sports she
enjoys attending Pittsburgh Sym-
phony concert and entertaining
friends at home.

Education In Transition

Development Of lMen

(EDITOR’S NOTE; This is th

e second of a series on contem-

porary education in all areas at Pitt.)

By David Breaksfone
The College Type hadn’t been typed very long in'l957

when Russia popped a satellite
other to help watchdog the ear
limit.

into orbit and later added an-
th. The sky was no longer the

Undoubtedly, the psychological effect of the sputniks was
as great as the actual scientiﬁc fact of the achievement. But

the Russians had clearly seized:

the initiative in the cold war and
the West would have to scramble,
just to catch up.

The tranquillizing
mushroom i n g
economy a n 01
domestic neace
w a s dispelled
quickly by the
“spy in th e
s k y.” Ameri-
cans, accustom-
ed to letting
Ike do-it, were
faced with the
c h a l l e nge of
thinking seri-
ously and independently.

In many cases, however, sudden
alarm, rather than thoughtful con-
sideration, was the public reac-
tion. The cry was for more money
for every conceivable “crash”
program.

The furor has abated some-
what, but few intelligent observ-
ers are optimistic enough to
deny that world freedom has
been severely and singularly
threatened. It will be difﬁcult,
however, for this country to
meet the threat, if the alarm
manifested after the satellite
launching is indicative of the
public’s inability to think ra-
tionally in times of stress.

Today, the demand for a careful
reappraisal of our educational sys-
tem remains insistent. Undoubted-
ly, the ﬁelds of science will get
the fanfare and even the scholar-
ships in the beginning. Eventual-
ly, all scholarly endeavor would
beneﬁt from a new emphasis on
improved education.

World Crisis

This crisis on the world level
and its effect upon American edu-
cation may altar the attitude of
cation may alter the attitude of
critical eye of public opinion upon
education, the undergraduate may
be forced from his silent, conser-
vative role. The campuses of
America will become increasingly
alive with the re-evaluation of
learning, and the search for an
effective answer to the’ challenge
to our democracy. _

The undergraduate may have
to broaden his horizons and

aura of a

blems and of his place in a re-
bounding society. The short term
goal of material security becomes
a myth in the face of superior Red
technology.

Education as a means of best
preparing the individual for a
useful, productive place in a
democratic economy becomes
important. A liberal education,
wide in scope and penetrating
in depth, which prepares the
total man, will become neces-
sary.

The College Student, 1958, may

realize that he must become an
outspoken, rational unit of the
country’s educational system. The
time is now for words and deeds,
on the college campus, which set
a national pattern.» The challenge
for thoughtful change is clelarly
before the college student.
Revitalized Education

Here at the University, I believe
that we immediately face the
challenge of becoming an organic
part of revitalized education. Be-
cause of the changes under the
new administration, we have al-
ready begun to realize the task
of breaking with tradition and of
establishing new scales of values.
The situation of the United States
onlyreinforces our obligation to
active participation.

There must be perspective in
any attempt to move in new di-
rections. A new calendar year af-
fords a good opportunity to assess
the current University scene and
to look to the future.

As College Students who do not
ﬁt the old Type we must pause to
consider our school in its par-
ticular educational transition.

  Deans Assistantships

Ray King To Lead
Honorary Groups,

Social Fraternities
By KATHY CLEARY

A fall semester addition to

the University, Ray King, can

' usually be found heaps of

papers behind his desk in the
Dean of Men’s Oﬂice. ",
King, an assistant to the

Dean of Men, came to Pittsburgh
to begin a career in student per-
sonnel administration after grad-
uating from Drake University in
Feb. of 1956.

Born and raised in Rockford,
Illinois, he came eastward to take
advantage of the opportunities
offered here and to continue his
studies in the ﬁeld of administra-
tion. V

Continues as Adviser

Active in fraternity life as an
undergraduate, King continued
his association with the organiza-
tions as the adviser to all fra-
ternities on the campus, including
the social, professional and hon-
orary ones.

While covering Western Penn-
sylvania and West Virginia as
district governor for Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternity, King enjoys
the opportunity of developing
one of his main interests: trav-
eling.

He estimates that he has visited
nearly two-hundred colleges and
universities all over the United
States while traveling on fratern-
ity business.

‘Flick Fan’

In addition to his other interests

and hobbies, King most aptly de-

scribes his enthusiasm towards

them by stating: “I’m a ski fiend,
a hi-ﬁ and flick fan.”

He shows a deﬁnite interest in
skiing, being a member in good
standing of the Pittsburgh Ski
Club, prefers semi-classical mu-
sic and show tunes, and enjoys
athletics and good movies in
general.

When asked for an opinion on
rock ’n roll type music, he smiled
serenely and diclined to comment.

King’s other main interest ﬁts
in well with his position here at
the University. “I enjoy working
with students in all phases of stu-
dent activity and stuednt life.”

Initiates Study Hall

There is also a teaching aspect
to his work here. King partici-
pates in the Men’s Conference
program.

He initiated the pledge study
hall project which is a part of
the Interfraternity Pledge Coun-
cilprogram designed to" aid in
the functioning and develop

, ment of the pledging system

and academic standards of the
pledges. ,

Before entering college, King
was called into the service in the
summer of 1950, and served as a
marine. He was stationed at Camp
Pendleton for training and went
to Korea until his discharge in

l 1952.

King has set as his future goal,
continued work in the ﬁeld of stu-
dent personnel administration.

Peake Sees,

Educational
Inadequacy

By MILLARD AMDUR

“Sputniks have awakened
America from its complac-
ency in the recent clamor con-
cerning education. Everyone
wants to do something about
America’s Shortcomings.”

So said Dr. Charles Peake, as;
sistant chancellor for student af-
fairs, at the Phi Eta Sigma ban-
quet on Wednesday, Jan. 8, in
the Supper Room of the Student
Union.

Dr. Peake believes that we have
not placed proper value on fun-
damental knowledge and basic re-
search. We have been, perhaps,
too concerned about “practical
aspects.” ,

Values May Fail

The teaching profcssion’s low
economic rating is indicative of a
lack of respect for learning. Yet
if we don’t support this element,
it is only sign of a failing in our
own value systems.”

The use of the .egghead as a
“lethal weapon” shows our so-
ciety’s regard for the intelle‘ctuaL,
making all but impossible any
real creativity. _ ,

Science today is unescapably
aligned with survival, stated
Peake. We are running the risk,
however, “of thinking only of
technicians, not creative scien-
tists.”

Few Advance Science
Science moves forward by the
work of comparatively few scien-

tists who are outstandingly crea-

tive.

It is important to consider in
the present uproar what it is
that is surviving. Philosopher
Boas at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity has spoken of the dispro-
portionate amounts awarded to-
science as opposed to the hu-
manities.

Boas exclaimed: “Humanities
are unnecessary to survival;- they
are only necessary to civilization.”

An old Chinese saying was
selected by Dr. Peake as partic-
ularly expressive:“‘Crisis is op-
portunity accompanied by grave
danger.”

Individuals Must Develop

“A reaffirmation of these fun-
damental principals depends,” up-
on the fullest development of the
capabilities of each individual,
not the retention of common med-
iocrity or adjustment. '

“In this manner, advances are
won in our culture. In the higlf
schools we have lost sight of in-
dividual differences in capabili-
ties and in scope of learning. «We
must awaken interest in these
ﬁields and establish high and
meaningful goals.” .

A flexibility is also essential on
the college level to develop all the
resources with which “nature has
endowed each of us.”

Competence _ Fostered

In graduate schools and profes-
sional schools in our complex so-
ciety, special competence as well
as breadth and adaptability must
be fostered for the best interests
of our nation.

Systematically, the interde-
pendence of institutions of learn-
ing is evolving, whether it bi?
high school, college, or grad-
professional school. '

The continuum of the student
brings the levels together. as we
move forward with ever-increas-
ing power. Otherwise, we have
failed. ‘

Pitt had begun to see ‘these
problems and opportunities even
before the launching’ of the
Sputniks and has proceded to
do something about it always
attempting to consider things
in their proper perspective.

He summedup by saying that
we must bear in mind” that what
will survive may not be worth
survival. '  - ‘  -

Ever meet a dreamer?

Frills instead of fundamentals are what interestyhim.
In his future job he dreams of a carpeted office, a re-
sounding title, an acre of polished mahogany to sit
behind. Wide-awake men, on the other hand, look ﬁrst
of all for fundamen’tals— sound training, advancement
opportunity, challenging work, professional associates,

good pay. The frills will follow.

The Bell Telephone Companies offer such career
fundamentals to wide-awake, ambitious young men major-
ing in the arts, the sciences, business or engineering.
