Professor links
peer pressure to
health choices

Meagan Hart
Staff Wrz'ter

David Shoham believes that peer pres-
sure can be a good inﬂuence when it

A comes to promoting a healthy lifestyle.

Shoham, an assistant professor in

' Pitt’s Department of Preventive Medi-

cine and Epidemiology, researches the
connection between social networking
and its effect on levels of obesity, to
prove whether close friends have a large
impact on a person’s health choices.

Shoham shared some of his ﬁndings
to 25 Pitt faculty members and stu-
dents in his lecture, Social Networking
to Combat Obesity: Worth the Effort?,
that was held in Perron Hall at 3 p.m.

“I try to prove whether thin people
tend to be friends with thin people, and
larger people befriend other larger peo-
ple, and whether this inﬂuences overall
life choices,” Shoham said.

Shahom began studying cardiovascu-
lar disease at Loyola University of Chi-
cago, which led him to study obesity. He
researched whether people, especially
young people, befriend each other based

STUDENT‘ GOVERNMENT

Board proposes fund for student housing crises

Abbey Reighard
Staff Wrz'ter

The Student Government Board plans to
expedite fundraising efforts surround-
ing students’ housing crises with a new
program. A T
The program comes as a result of
recent off-campus‘ crises —. the Dawson
Street house explosion in November

2013 and the Zulema Street house ﬁre
in March 2013 —— that affected Pitt
students.

Board member Graeme Meyer and.

Board President Mike Nites have been
working on a pilot program called the
Crisis Relief Fund. The fund -— reserved
for emergency housing crises — will
consist of $2,000 from the Student
Government Board’s budget.

The Board introduced the new pro-
gram at its 8:45 p.m. public meeting
Tuesday night in Nordy’s Place. About
25 people attended.

Meyer, who is also the Health and
Wellness Committee liaison, said he
and the rest of the Board have decided

to wait until next week’s meeting to
vote on the program until they have
“hammered out all the details.” '

Students who are eligible for crisis
relief funding may receive up to $250,
depending on whether or not the stu-
dent has insurance that covers the
damage.

“If you don’t have any sort of renter’s
insurance, you would potentially re-
ceive slightly more funds than someone
who does have insurance,” Meyer said.

The amount of property students
lost, Meyer said, would also determine
the amount of money students receive.
Students affected by crises would be
required to turn in an itemized list of
materials that the funds would be used
toward.

Meyer and Nites are currently as-
sembling a Crisis Relief Fund Commit-
tee, whose members would oversee the
distribution of funds.

The committee will consist of five
members. Jasmine Butler, the Health
and Wellness Committee chairwoman,

on weight and whether these friend-
ships influence overall life choices.

“If someone tries to lose weight,
their overweight friends may think it’s
weird and pull them back,” Shoham
said.

Shoham spoke about how people
who have a larger social networking
system — for example, those with a
larger group of friends —— have a greater
inﬂuence on those around them.

One type of experiment Shoham uses
in his research to determine the size of
a person’s social network is to ask high
school students to name their top five
closest friends. If the five friends named
do not reciprocate a particular student’s
friendship when asked the same ques-
tion, the initial student is considered
to have a small social network.

According to Shoham, if people with
a large social network are healthy and

who is also SGB’s business manager, will
be members ofthe committee.

Nites said he will likely pick the
three remaining committee members
from the Health and Wellness Commit-
tee or from other Student Government
Board committees after the Board votes
on the institution of the fund.

Students affected by housing crises
can use the funds to purchase items for
classes —- such as books, notebooks
and calculators ——- as well as essential
living items.

The funds will not cover personal
electronic devices or items already cov-
ered under a student’s existing insur-
ance policy.

The Board initially considered hav-
ing the committee distribute the funds
through a rolling-basis application
process, but to minimize timing ofthe
process, is rethinking how to approach
students facing housing crises.

“We may potentially have the com-
mittee reach out to students who need
funding so that it’s less of a burden for
them to request funding and go through
the application process,” Meyer said.

Meyer said the program would be
available for students living off-campus
during the summer as well, aslong as

educated about the effects of obesity,
the idea will spread and stimulate oth-
ers to do the same. This will eventually
lead to a lower overall body mass index.

Shoham said he could use ideas of
social learning theory, a cognitive learn-
ing process that takes place in a social
context, and peer pressure to create
healthy lifestyles for people.

“People tend to conform to the ideas
of those that they respect, and if we
take advantage of that, we can cause
change,” he said.

Pitt’s Public Health Dynamics Labo-
ratory, which leads the development of
computational modeling and simula-
tion in Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health, sponsored the lecture. The labo-
ratory also aims to create open-source
software that allows access to data and
simulated populations.

those students are conducting research
or taking classes. Students enrolled
as full—time students for the following
fall semester would also be eligible for
the fund.

The Crisis Relief Fund would not ap-
ply in the summer to students who had
recently graduated.

The Student Activities Fund, to
which each student pays $80 per se-
mester, would absorb any remaining
money from the Crisis Relief Fund, ac-
cording to Meyer, and he hopes that it
usually will. /

“Ideally, we will never have to use
[the Fund]; but in instances where we

. do need it, it’ll be there,” Meyer said.

N ites said the Board should officially
vote on the pilot program by next week’s
meeting. '

Kayla Keddal, a senior majoring in
English writing and communications,
lived in the house at 3376 ﬁawson St.
that exploded Nov. 28, 2013, while she
and the three other residents were
home for Thanksgiving break.’

Keddal said she thinks the Crisis
Relief Fund would have helped her at
the time of the explosion because she
didn’t have horneowner’s or renter’s
insurance.

“I thinkla fund like this would deﬁ- «

nitely help get students through the
initial transition phase, especially for
those who may have to start commuting
and need gas money or food on the go,”
Keddal said.

Keddal said she doesn’t think SGB
should focus on replacing belongings
with the program. She said the program
should focus on “getting students back
on their feet,” by providing funds for
transportation and on-the-go food that
students need immediately after the
crisis occurs. 5

“I only say this because in a disas-
ter where everything is lost, replacing
belongings costs thousands of dollars,
and realizing this creates a great deal
of stress,” Keddal said.

The program does not currently
cover things such as transportation or
food, Meyer said, but the Board can
make additions to the pilot program
in the future. S 

“As of right now, the fund would
just coveritems essential for academic
success,” Meyer said. “The_ fund is just
meant to help people get back on their

feet in the short term.”

Elizabeth Roth, a first-year gradu-
ate student, was one of 13 students
who lived in an apartment building on
Zulema‘Street that burned down in the
ﬁre last spring.

Roth said she thinks the Crisis Relief
Fund is a great idea, adding that she’s
“glad that Pitt is being proactive about
future housing crises.” _

Roth said she thinks the program
would have really helped her after she
lost all of her belongings in the fire.

“Had a program like this been in
place when I had my apartment fire
last spring, it definitely would have ex-
pedited the process of replacing some of
the necessities that I’d lost,” Roth said‘.

Roth also said she thinks preventive
safety measures and spreading aware-
ness are important as well.

“Nobody ever expects to lose all their
belongings, but obviously it happens,”
Roth said. “I realize that might be be-
yond the scope of this program, but
that’s one of those areas that people
don’t usually think about until it’s too
late.”

In other action:

Allocations chairwoman Nasreen
Harun and Nites announced that the
Allocations Committee and the Board
will work to reduce the amount of al-
locations distributed.

Nites said the Student Organization
Resource Center provided an official
total of funds — $891,608.60 — that
the Board allocated this ﬁscal‘ year.

The Board and the Allocations Com-
mittee think the total is too high, and
said SGB will be more frugal with the
amount of money allocated each week
and will also ask student groups with
leftover money from previous alloca-
tion requests to return that money to
be redistributed by the Board and the
committee. I

“This just means we will be reviewing
requests more carefully,” Harun said.
“We’ve always stressed shared respon-
sibility with allocations, and now we’ll
be doing that even more.” , ;

Board member Abby Zurschmit has
been gathering information about Safe
Rider smartphone apps at other schools
to compare the data with Pitt’s Safe
Rider system.

Board member Brandon Benjamin
met with Christine Patterson, a liaison
to the readership program for: The New
York Times, to plan for the upcoming
New York Times speaker who will come
to campus March 31. Benjamin also met
with Vice Provost and Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey about his initiative
to make course descriptions available
on the course registration site during
class registration, rather than on dif-
ferent sites.

Board member Mona Kazour at-
tended a “green” round table meeting,
where shediscussed green initiatives
with environmental groups.

Meyer met with Marian Vanek, di-
rector of Student Health, to discuss a
tobacco-use survey that Meyer plans to
conduct. Meyer hopes to reduce tobacco
usage with his initiative that aims to
ban smoking within 15 feet of a campus
building. I

Unionizing college football players blurs deﬁnition of a university

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

Besides the fact that only one team
showed up to the Super Bowl this
year and that the Winter Olympics
in Sochi were clouded with con-
troversial conditions before they
even began, Ithink one of the most
pertinent issues emerging from the
sports world right now is the union-
ization of college football players.
In case you haven’t heard, a
group of Northwestern University
football players have recently an-
nounced that they will seek permis-
sion from the U.S. government to
form a labor union. If successﬁil,
they would be affiliated with the
United Steelworkers — who would
handle all of the technical processes
— and the players would then be
recognized as university employees

and consequently, would retain the
right to collectively bargain.

The effort is being spearheaded
by Northwestern quarterback Kain
Colter, who, in explaining his mo-
tivation to ESPN, said, “Right now
the NCAA is like a dictatorship. No
one represents us in negotiations.
The only way things are going to
change is if players have a union.”

Colter isundeniably correct in '

his assertion about the NCAA here,

seeing that the NCAA is indeed an.

unchecked monopoly that wields
supreme power — mainly through
athlete scholarship limitations -4
over the athletes who help generate
its wealth. And being that it is com-
pletely self-regulated with virtually
no competition, the NCAA has eas-
ily been able to transform college
football into a $5 billion industry.
And the demand for football

won’t go away anytime soon. There-
fore, I can completely understand
why these athletes want recogni-
tion and protection rights as legal
employees for such a big business.

However, there’s an underlying
issue here that has gone unspoken

g in the debate, and it concerns the

intended —— or maybe most desired
— goals of our academic institu-

tions. Universities are, believe it
or not, supposed to be a means for’

students to achieve knowledge and
educational opportunity, rather
than self-concerned businesses
that rationally seek to maximize
proﬁts: though one can certainly
make the argument that they are
turning into that.

While I think Colter and his
tearnmate’s intentions are genu-
ine, I fear that if they achieve legal
employee status, it will only exac-

erbate the perception of colleges as

businesses, ratherthanieducational

institutions. . - -
Student athletes as employees

would continue to shift focus away .

from the average student and to-
ward the development of the high-
proﬁle athlete, who in this case is
not only the employee,‘ but the

' product as well. The overall goal of

a university is not to reﬁnefootball
players, and they are not meant to
befarm leagues cateringto the NFL.

Universities aren’t like what
theontario Hockey League is to
hockey, to use an outside example.
In the Ontario Hockey League, play-
ers who are 15 to 20 years old play
in a junior league where they fo-
cus solely on their sport, and they
are also paid to do so because it’s a
business. Teams invest in players,
who, in return, earn profits by at-

tracting crowds. ,Afte;_'ward, these
players then continue their career
paths toward the National Hockey
League draft where they will hope
to be selected to continue pursuing
and perfecting their craft profes-
sionally.’ L A Z -

Of course, I know that many
universities essentially do this al-
ready; They invest in players by
doling out money to pay for their
athletes’ time in college, and in re-

v tum, the players attract fans and

money. The point'4I’m’ trying to
make is that this is the problem in
the ﬁrst place. The emphasis on big
money athletics undermines the
value of the educational aspect of
college, and paying college athletes
will only continue to enforce the
idea that college for the star players

is, in fact, merely a farm league.
Furthermore, paying college players

many sports programs —— such as swimming,
baseball and rowing — in favor of the more
high—proﬁle sports. If universities then have
to face a football players union, it is not doubt~
ful that this trend would certainly increase.

' As Slate’s John Culhane wrote, “The suc—

cess of football and basketball players in"

generate revenue, causing sports like wres- I

tling to disappear even fasterthan they’re
vanishing now.”
2 Countless universities have already cut

sources or the means to generatecompetitive
proﬁts.

Yet, despite all of these things, we_will
always undoubtedly love our football team.
But why not love them as fellow students‘? If
players unionize, it would only further sepa-
rate them from the student body as preferred
money making agents. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

This past Friday the Global Studies Center
hosted a lecture titled, “The Settler Movement:
History, Impacts, and Perceptions” by Luke
Peterson. According to the announcement dis-
uibuted from the Global Studies Center, “The
lecture [exarnined]e the politics, history and
impact of this movement (settlements) from
its inception in the early 1970s through to the

present day.” However, Peterson’s speech did '

not address these issues factually. Instead, his
lecture demonized Israeli settlements as a tool
of the Netanyahu administration to remove the
possibility of a future two—state solution and
the key issue in resolving the conflict.
Peterson claimed. that the settled land
comes from Palestine’s possession. However,
in 1967, the West Bank was captured from
the Jordanians during the Six-Day War. This
war was a strike on Israel by multiple Arab
countries. Miraculously, Israel was able to
defensively push back the Jordanians out of
the Jordanian-annexed West Bank. In July
of 1967, Israeli Cabinet Minister Yigal Allon
drafted a plan to maintain military control
over a strip comprising less than halfof the

West Bank from the Dead Sea to Jerusalem
and west of Ramallah. Over the years, many
historical premodem State of Israel Jewish
land was settled once again in the West Bank.
The settlements in the West Bank account
for 5 percent of total land. All other security
measures, suchas checkpoints, are for the sole
purpose of protection and do not inhibit the
existence of Arab neighborhoods.

There are far greater dangers in the region
than settlements. According to Palestinian
Media Watch, Al—Khansa, a mother of four
terrorists, is the namesake of eight schools
under the Palestinian Authority. As I saw on
my trip to Bethlehem, maps cease to recognize
the existence of the State of Israel.

In order to truly bring peace, universities
around the world should educate students,
faculty, staff and the greater community
through unbiased, accurately informed and
open dialogue events.

Old foes rekindle rivalry as top—ranked Syracuse visits Pitt

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

When the ball goes in the air for tonight’s
tipoff, the Panthers will need to ﬁnd a
way to break out of their three-game
slump —-— especially with the class of the
nation opposing them. 5

Pitt (20-4, 8-3 ACC) has scored just
55.3 points per game in its last three
contests, in which the Panthers lost to
Virginia at home and needed overtime to
defeat conference bottom-feeders Miami
and Virginia Tech. That number is 18
points lower than Pitt’s 73.3 points~per—
game overall average in the 2013-2014
season.

While No. 17 Virginia ranks among
the nation’s best teams defensively, the
Hurricanes and the Hokies employed
zone defenses that Pitt head coach Ja-
mie Dixon said contributed to the close
games.

Facing two relatively uncelebrated
zones, the Panthers’ last three games
have been decided by ﬁve points or fewer.

As No. 1 Syracuse (23-0, 10-0 ACC)
visits the Petersen Events Center at 7
p.m., the Orange bring college basket-
ball’s most notorious zone defense to
the table — one that should challenge
Pitt more than that of Miami or Virginia
Tech.

“Coach [Jim] Boeheim, he recruits
guys who are long, athletic, super tall like
the Monstars,” guard Cameron Wright
said, referring to the freakishly athletic
team in the 1996 movie “Spacejam.”

But as former Big East and current
ACC rivals, each side knows what to ex-
pect.

“There’s a long history with us,” Dix-
on said. “We know what they’re going
to do, and they know what we’re going
to do.”

The most recent installment in that
history was a 59-54 Syracuse victory
against Pitt at the Carrier Dome onjan.
18. Pitt held a 52-49 advantage with three
minutes to play that Saturday, but the

Orange ﬁnished on a 10-2 run to remain
undefeated.

“They were the better team that day,”
Wright said. “We’re deﬁnitely excited to
play them again.”

That same anticipation has stuck
with the student body and the Univer-
sity itself, where the No. 25 Panthers
face another top-ﬁve team at the Pe-
tersen Events Center. As the Oaklandzoo
proudly boasts, Pitt is 9-0 against teams
ranked in the top ﬁve on its home ﬂoor.

But on the player’s side, the focus re-
mains on playing the game as opposed
to any hype and fanfare.

“I was always told by my father to just
go to sleep [the night before],” Wright
said. “It’s a normal game when the ball
goes in the air.” .

A huge part of the players’ focus
on the game play centers on shaking a
stretch of rusty performances.

In his team’s recent games, freshman
point guardljosh Newkirk saw other
teams trying to slow Pitt down. As a re-
sult, Pitt’s games resemble those from
the Panthers’ days in the Big East with
a style Newkirk describes as “grinding.”

“All games, you can’t really score a
lot, get out and run,” Newkirk said. “You

just gotta grind it out sometimes and win
with defense.”

With the use of zone defenses against
the Panthers by teams such as Miami
and Virginia Tech, which traditionally
defend in man-to-man defense, scor-
ing declined as Dixon thought it would,
especially alongside the implementation
of stricter foul rules on the perimeter.

Against Virginia Tech, the Panthers’
offense against the zone was impacted by
the injury to Lamar Patterson’s shooting
hand. Patterson shot multiple air-bal-l at-
tempts from 3-point range and ﬁnished
1-of-9 from the ﬁeld.

Patterson’s status is still a question
mark for Wednesday’s game, and Dixon
said the forward did not practice Mon-

jordano said some of that depth is
padded by the inﬂux of recruits, each
of whom has a role on the roster.

“We have a very nice mix of fresh-
men and junior college players coming
innext fall,” he said. “It was our goal to
continue our effort to raise the standard
and the quality of player without sacri-
ficing integrity and character. Each of
our recruits w_ill ﬁll a speciﬁc position
and will certainly elevate the quality of
our program.” A

The Panthers also signed three play-

ers who can play the outﬁeld in Nick
Yarnall, Frank Maldonado and Nick

are projected to be outﬁelders, whereas,
Montefusco might make more of an im-
pact on the mound.

The Panthers also added inﬁelder P.].
DeMeo, a Pittsburgh ,Central Catholic
product, and right-hander Dan Furman.

In total, the Panthers recruited 11
graduating high school seniors and
three junior college transfers, in addi-
tion toiPerfect Game’s Top Newcomer
in the ACC Adam Dian;

A Jordana added that “the combination
ofa world.-class education as well as our
move into the ACC” has helped Pitt’s

. recruiting efforts, leading to what he

called “one of the best, if not the best”
classes during his tenure.
Despite the great success that the

‘ team enjoyed last season in the Big East,

Pitt will facea steep challenge in its first

season in the ACC — a conference that I
_ placed eight teams in the NCAA Tourna-

ment and had six teams ranked in the

' - , preseason poll.

Fellow ACC members Georgia Tech,

, Notre_ Dame and Virginia Tech all re-

ceived votes, too. Yet Jordano sees the

schedule asa challenge.

“I really like this schedule,” he said in
a press release. “I think what you try to
do is position your team to play against
competition that is capable of playing,
and has been successful, in the NCAA

-Tournament because that’s our goal.”

If you doubt]ordano’s calm approach
to an arduous league, consider his initial
response when asked about the transi-
tion to the ACC. ~

“I wish I had a buck for every time I
have been asked that question. My re-
sponse is siritple. We will be ready,” he
said in an interview on the team site.

“Listen, I cannot predict wins and losses

at this point, I don’t think any program
can, but what I can say is that we can
control what we are doing, and I can
assure you we are working harder than
ever, and our team is well—aware that
we are taking a huge step up competing
in the ACC.” ' .

The Panthers will play a 54-game
slate in 2014 (30 road games, 20 home
games, 4 ‘neutral site games) that in-

day. Pitt’s leading scorer posted 18 points ‘

In tandem with the offense, Dixon
says his team’s rebounding also needs to
get better. Virginia Tech out—rebounded
Pitt by 15 Saturday, a rareoccurrencelfor

“We’ve got to block out better, we’ve

with long rebounds better,” Dixon said.
While the Panthers’ ﬂaws were ex-
posed in their last three games, they

also showed the mental fortitude nec- -  P V l

essary to win games that just as easily
could have been lost. To beat Syracuse,

the Panthers need a full 40 minutes of , V

mental toughness.
“This game is mental more than it is

secutive season, the 136th and 137th

In,2014, the Panthers will face seven
teams that made the NCAA Tournament

The Panthers open up conference" play‘ .

The team opens its season on the ‘
road this Friday, before it travels back

the Panthers have to come to expect it.
Jordano certainly has. . . P
