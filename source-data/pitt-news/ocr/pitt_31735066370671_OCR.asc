THE PITT NEWS

Serving the University of Pittsburgh community since 1906

Wednesday, July I6, 1986

Vol. 80, No. 89

Benjamin
returns to
Minnesota  

Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

President Wesley Posvar concluded the winte.
term with Vice Presidentjack Freeman and Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin assisting him in preparing
for the bicentenniai year.

Only two months later, he finds himself
awaiting the results of interviews by search com-

'mittees formed to replace both men.

Freeman left Pitt on July 1 to begin his tenure
as the president of the University of Maine. Ben- .
jamin, with a sudden change of mind, left last
week to return to the University of Minnesota
to serve as vice president and provost under
president and long-time associate Kenneth
Keller.

While Posvar was prepared for the departure
‘of Freeman, Benjamin's decision has left him
surprised.

When interviewed by The Pitt News last Tues-
day afternoon, Benjamin said he believed he
would remain here for at least the next five years.
On Wednesday morning, he announced his
decision to accept the job at Minnesota.

”It’s a very attractive job, and it would have
been a great opportunity,” Benjamin said of the
Minnesota job in the same interview. ”But, I've
had a role in hiring five new deans and a number
of senior faculty here, and I'd really like to see
this through.

”I really do think it probably would have been
a mistake to go [to Minnesota}. Life is about
choices. in my case, you can’t go home again.”

The foliowing day, he announced he was go-
ing home again. Benjamin worked for 17 years
at Minnesota before coming to Pitt.

”l was amazed at the reversal because of its
suddenness," said Posvar yesterday. ”He was
very positive and optimistic when I talked to him
[about staying at Pitt] on Tuesday evening.

Former Pitt Provost Roger Benjamin relaxes at the Unive
where he last Wednesday accepted the No. 2 position under President Ken-

Benjamin told The Pitt News he was content with his position at the Univer-

The oppression of women is a
 worldwide affliction. This was the
message of Madhu Kishwar, a noted
women's rights leader in India, when
she spoke last Thursday addressing
issues of women's oppression and in-
justice in her lecture, ”Women and
Social Change.”

Kishwar, who teaches English
literature at Delhi University, also
founded Manushi. Initially a
women’s group in 1977, it later
evolved into a women—oriented,
women—operated journal concerned
with protecting women's land and
employment rights, and providing
legal services.

Women’s issues in India are
”usually confined to sensational acts
ofviolence,” she said, which distracts
the public from the real issues.

She explained that the need to
document the struggles of the com-
mon Indian woman was what in-
spired her to organize the magazine.
’’It began with a definite commitment
to not limit concern to women like
ourselves,” she said, noting that
many women inhabit the rural sector.

“One of the important tasks is not
just documenting struggles but also
an attempt to understand women's
oppression by understanding the
everyday struggles of women,” said
Kishwar.

She said that because it is extreme-
ly difficult to avoid sensationalism,
Manushi aims to affect structural
changes in order to trigger other
changes beneficial to the women's
cause.

The Manushi group tries to achieve
this by conducting systematic in-
vestigations combined with social
science research and investigative
journalism.

Pitt Men's Study teaches methods of prevention

Matthew Thornton

Staff Writer

Researchers from Pitt recently attended a conference in Paris
sponsored by the World Health Organization on the diagnosis
and treatment of AIDS. They were presenting the initial find-
ings of the $4.1 million Pitt Men's Study, which has been in
progress at the university for about a year.

Currently there are about 1,900 homosexual and bisexual
men participating in the study, according to Dr. David Lyter,
assistant director of the Pitt Men's Study. ”Every six months in-
dividuals come in for evaluation,” he said.

Lyter reported success in the portion of the study designed
to ’’look at the effectiveness of education in changing suscepti-
ble men's lifestyles. The program is a group therapy in which
homosexual men are tested on their knowledge of the disease
before and after an educational program,” Lyter said. ”There
is an improvement in the attitudes of gay men about their sex-
ual practices after the group sessions.”

Lyter also said that ”the ability to create positive attitude
change is essential in any health promotion program,” and that
the Pitt study has done just that.

”There is an improvement in the at-
titudes of gay men about their sexual
practices after the group session.”

— Dr. David Lyter

Ronald Valdiserri, co-investigator of the project, said that
prevention programming is crucial.

”|t’s all we've got to keep this disease from killing more peo-
ple,” he said. ”Some of the drugs coming out of this conference
are very promising, but it will be years before they're developed
for human trials.”

In addition to the Pitt Men's Study, the university has received
an additional grant to test some of the new drugs being

' developed for the treatment of AIDS. This $4.6 million grant

is part of a $100 million study funded by the federal govern-
ment at 14 research centers to study the drugs that have shown
promise in combatting the AIDS virus. .

Pitt has one of the lowest incidences of AIDS of any of the

institutions participating in the study. So far only about 50 cases
have been reported in Pittsburgh, although that number is ex-
pected to double in the next year. The cities with the highest
incidences are New York and San Francisco.

In the Pitt study, Lyter said, 250 of the men under observa-
tion are carriers and 10 of those actually have the disease. ”One
in five gay men are carriers of the disease, and about one in
25 who are carriers will get AIDS,” Lyter added.

On the optimistic side, Lyter said that although he expects
more people to develop AIDS — the end stage of the disease
—- he does foresee the number of cases leveling off.

”We don't expect many new people to get the disease,” said
Lyter. ’’It should level off at some point because of the educa-
tion that people are getting. Some of the men [in the study] have
chosen to be celibate. Most of the men have just changed their
practices to less risky ones.”;

To date, only one case has been reported in which the pa-
tient recovered from the disease, but the doctors in that case
warned that ”it is an important step in the direction of treat-
ment, but by no means a breakthrough.” In the reported
recovery, bone marrow transplants from a healthy identical twin
were needed to make the treatment possible.

NASA says shuttle won't fly until 1988

United Press International ‘

WASHINGTON —— The nation's
space agency said Monday that the
earliest date the space shuttle could
resume flying would be in early
1988. Previously, the agency said the
shuttle missions would begin again .
in July of 1987.

In a report released to President
Reagan, the agency also indicated
that it hopes to redesign the booster
rockets so that existing hardware can
be used. Problems with the the shut-
tle’s solid fuel rocketboosters caused
the crash of the Challenger on
January 28 that killed seven
astronauts. The agency also said,
however, that if current equipment
fails to pass strenuous tests and safe-
ty reviews, it will develop contingen-
cy plans for a new design that does
not utilize existing hardware.

In a related development, Dr.
James Fletcher, the new head of
NASA, submitted a letter to President
Reagan urging construction of a new
shuttle orbiter to replace the lost

Challenger, White House officials
said.

Agency officials said they had
underestimated the time needed to
develop and test rocket insulation
and joint improvements. Officials
said the delay will increase pressure
on the defense department, commer-
cial companies and scientific institu-
tions that need to launch satellites.
The United States currently has no
means of putting heavy satellites in-
to space, and many satellites already
aloft are nearing the end of their ex-
pected lifetimes.

set off by remote control. No group
has yet claimed responsibility for the
fatal blast, but the ruling Socialist Par-
ty put the blame on Basque
Separatists. Basques seek an indepen-
dent state within Spanish borders.

Meanwhile, in neighboring Por-
tugal, five bomb blasts rocked the
country Monday. One of the blasts
killed the son of an army colonel and
a civilian .in the officer's Lisbon
apartment.

Over 500 people have been killed
in similar bombings over the last
decade, according to officials.

Miller gets life

LOS ANGELES —— Richard Miller,
the only Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion agent ever convicted of es-
pionage, was sentenced Monday to
two life prison terms -plus 50 years in
prison for spying for the Soviets.

The judge said he hopes "Miller

will never again walk the streets of
this country.”

Miller, convicted June 19 of selling
American secrets to his Soviet lover
for sex and the promise of money,
broke his silence at Monday's senten-
cing, yelling to the judge that he was
innocent. Miller had previously
maintained silence throughout trial
proceedings.

The government said that at least
80 percent of the nation's students
returned to classes after a six week
vacation, despite a call to stay away
by militant student leaders.

Israeli aircraft hit
Palestinian targets

BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Palestinian of-
ficials confirmed Monday that four
people were killed and 12 others in-
jured when Israeli jets bombed and
rocketed targets in hills southeast of
Beirut.

According to Lebanese police and
the American Red Cross, a 30-minute
raid on the areas killed four Druse
Militiamen and wounded 12 others,
including some civilians.

Lebanese Prime‘ Minister Rashid
Karami said the attack was an attempt
by the Israelis to sabotage a Beirut
security plan approved by the Syrians
two weeks ago that reinstated govern-
ment authority in the capital.

Israeli officials claim the raid was
in retaliation for recent rocket attacks
on northern Israel. About 500 Syrian
troops are currently entrenched in the
Beirut area, according to sources.

Pitt announces speaker for convocation

ment, he remarked, ’’I will miss opportunities like
this because I am about to enter a profession whose
utterances, as someone said, are somewhere between
a cliche and a falsehood. This may be the last
chance to say what I mean and mean what I say.”

In an interview with R. W. Apple Jr. of The New
York Times (March 19, 1979), Brewster said of his
new post that he did not see himself as a walking
advertisment for the ”American way of life,” or even
the prime channel of communication between
Washington and London.

"I hope I have managed to heighten Washington’s
sensibilities to British problems and prejudices on
major questions like  the neutron bomb and the
European monetary system,” said Brewster.

In the view of a leading British political journalist,
Brewster has ”a broader and deeper knowledge of
the leaders of this country than anyone Washington
has sent over here since David Bruce in the 1960s.”

College and university presidents from across the’
nation, many in the medieval academic regalia of
their institutions, as well as civic and political leaders
from the city, will attend the ceremony. At the formal
ceremony, Dr. Brewster will be awarded an honorary
degree from Pitt.

”Brewster was chosen because he is a symbol of
the officious and ceremonial academic group to be at
the convocation,” said Harry F. Kunselman, assistant
to the executive director of the Bicentennial a
Commission. .

Brewster is presently the master of University Col-
lege, Oxford University.

‘The Bicentennial Commission will officially open
the celebration on October 19 with a video display
titled "Campus of the Past — Campus of the Future,”
to be shown in the student union. During the re-
mainder of the week (Pitt's homecoming), the com-
mission will sponsor various symposia and celebra-

Kingman Brewster, former president of Yale Univer-
sity, will be the keynote speaker at Pitt’s opening
Bicentennial Convocation at the Syria Mosque on
October 21. The ceremony, honoring distinguished
Pitt alumni, will mark the formal beginning of Pitt's
year-long celebration of its 200th birthday.

Brewster, born in Massachusetts, has long been ac-
tive in political andacademic circles. As the presi-
dent of Yale University, he advocated social and
academic reform in the Yale community. Although
seriously criticized by the conservatives at Yale, he
was well-liked by the students and faculty. His liberal
image was brought to the public when
”Doonesbury” cartoonist Carry Trudeau, a Yale
graduate, created the President King character who .
bears a striking resemblance to Kingman Brewster.

In the early 1970s, Brewster drew heavy fire when '
some 15,000 demonstrators converged on Yale to
protest the murder trial of eight members of the
Black Panther organization. Offering Yale's hospitality
to the group, Brewster said, ”I am appalled and
ashamed that things should have come to such a
pass that I am skeptical of the ability black revolu-
tionaries have to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the
United States.” This declaration caused Vice Presi-
dent Spiro Agnew to demand ”a more mature and
responsible person to head the university.”

While at Yale, Brewster was appointed by Presi-
dent Carter to succeed Anne Armstrong as the am-
bassador to Great Britain. Brewster quipped that his
departure from New Haven might be worth $10
million to Yale fundraisers. Financial supporters of _
Yale pulled a sizeable portion of their money from
the university as a result of Brewster's leadership.

Senator Arlen Spector of Penn-
sylvania voiced concern over the in-
terpretation of the Constitution and
aid to Nicaraguan Contras in an ef-
fort to gain the support of the Western
Pennsylvania Black Political
Assembly Coalition.

Spector was the main speaker at
the Coalition's Sixth Annual
Senatorial Luncheon last Saturday,
held in honor of five local black
political leaders.

Among the honorees were Gladys
B. McNairy, a member of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh's board of trustees,
and K. Leroy Irvis, the speaker of the
Pennsylvania House of Repre-
sentatives.

The other honorees were Dr.
Thomas B. Meade of the Clairton City
Council, Carolynne O. Young of the
McKeesport City Council and Robert
French of the Braddock Hills City
Council.

The award ceremonies were
followed by Spector’s speech. He
revealed that his greatest concern is
the interpretation of the Constitution.
He quoted evangelist Pat Robertson,
a 1988 presidential candidate, ”Con-
gress, the courts and the executive

”The balance of power in the Senate is held
by moderate Republicans... The major civil rights
decisions are made by moderate Republicans.”

- Arlen Specter

are equal under the law, and Con-
gress and the executive don't have to
pay any attention to the courts.”

Specter responded to this by say-
ing, ”This is a man [Robertson] who
aspires to be president of the United
States; this is a man who graduated
from one of America's finest law
schools [Yale's].

”This [the concept that the federal
courts do not have the right of
judicial review] is a major danger
signal that affects the rights of
everyone in this room,” Specter
continued.

For the same reason, Specter re-
fused to vote to confirm the appoint-
ment of Daniel Manion to the federal
bench as the replacement for newly
appointed Supreme Court Justice An-
tonin Scalia.

”He [Manion] has taken the posi-
tion that the Supreme Court has no

right to interpret the Constitution. I ‘

don't think you can have a federal
judge who holds that kind of opin-
ion,” said Specter.

When asked if he questions Man-
ion’s competence, Specter replied, ’’I
do, but when you have a judge who
holds that opinion, that decides it for
me.”

Specter also elaborated on aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras. ’’I do not in-
tend to [vote to] spend $100 million
on the Contras when my own state,
Pennsylvania, is in such need.

”Last year, the United States gave
the Contras $27 million in non-
military aid, and most of it ended up
in the hands of the Contra leaders,”
Specter said.

He pointed out that his race against
U.S. Representative Bob Edgar (D-
Delaware County) could do a lot to
decide the political make up of the

Senate. ”I believe that it will be a
tough re-election race, and I am
prepared for that.

”The balance of power in the

Senate,” said Specter, ”is held by

moderate Republicans, such as
Lowell Weicker [Connecticut] and

A Bob Packwood [California]. The ma-

jor decisions on civil rights are [also]
made by moderate Republicans.”

At the conclusion of Specter’s
speech, Doris Carson Williams, the
chairwoman of the Allegheny Black
Republican Council and a coor-
dinator for Specter’s campaign,
pledged her personal support for the
campaigns of Specter and William
Scranton, Pennsylvania's lieutenant
governor who is running for
governor.

”The most important thing we
want to know [about a U.S. Senator]
is that we have access to him. Senator
Specter has shown us that we have
access to him,” said Williams.

This is Specter’s first re-election
bid. In 1980, when he won election
to his first term in the Senate, the
Western Pennsylvania Black Political
Assembly Coalition endorsed Specter
for Senate but refused to endorse Jim-
my Carter, who was then president.
When asked if the group endorsed
President Ronald Reagan, Williams

Specter seeks support of black political leaders

replied, ”We wouldn't think of that.
We didn’t do it the last time either.”

Phil Carter, the organizer of the
luncheon, said that it was too early
in the campaign to endorse either
Specter or Edgar. ”Endorsements
aren't usually received until Labor
Day,” said Carter. ”We will assess,
evaluate and make the endorsement.
 We [Western Pennsylvania Black
Political Assembly Coalition] will
begin this process next week.”

Of the six annual senatorial lunch-
eons, Specter has been the keynote

speaker at five. ”We asked [Senator

John] Heinz once, but we haven't
asked him again,” said Carter. ”We
feel that we have more access to
Senator Specter."

Local institutions suffer
with integrity problems

Roger Benjamin's about—face decision to accept a posi-
tion at the University of Minnesota last week was an em-
barrassment to the University of Pittsburgh.

After revealing to The Pitt News and another campus
publication that he had decided to remain as provost at
Pitt, less than 12 hours later, he accepted the job in
Minnesota.

What possessed Benjamin to do this? Was he attempt-
ing to obtain a better offer from Minnesota? Or was he
just not exactly sure of what he wanted to do when when
he told The Pitt News that he was planning to stay at Pitt?

Regardless, it still left egg — once again —— on the univer-
sity's face. No one will ever know what was going on in
Benjamin's mind when he stated his intentions, then did
the exact opposite of what he stated. The question is: Is
this type of conduct typical of the senior administration
here at the University of Pittsburgh? One should think not,
but it is time for a mandate from President Posvar explain-
ing exactly what type of image he expects from the highly
visible officials of this university to project.

just last week, reports surfaced that three of the four
basketball recruits may not be eligible next year because
they could not score above 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test. Again: What type of image is the university trying
to project? Does the university recruit athletic students?
Or does it recruit student athletes?

As Pitt begins its bicentennial celebration, the ad-
ministration must make an attempt to show that this univer-
sity is a top institution of higher education. The students
do their part. Now it is time for the administration to do
its part. As a student, one should not be embarrassed by
the fact that he or she attends the University of Pittsburgh.

The University of Pittsburgh is not the only institution
in the area that has had its image under scrutiny lately
either. Pittsburgh's Presbyterian Hospital, known as the
leading center for organ transplants, is usually spoken of
with pride because of it's manymedical accomplishments.
Lately, though, it appears that the hospital needs to look
at the many moral, legal, and ethical questions surroun-
ding the entire issue of transplant surgery. ’

Granted, people are now being given a second chance
at life, but does the hospital have the right to choose who
gets the transplant. Doesn't it seem that the hospital would
maybe, just maybe, be tempted to give preferential treat-
ment to someone who could pay more than another per-
son. After all, the hospital must cover many financial ex-
penditures. Ever since Donald Denny, the organ procure-
ment coordinator for the University Health Center resigned
because he felt that the system was not working proper-
ly, many potential organ recipients wonder what their ac-

_ tual chances are of receiving an organ. Do these people

needthis worry and what is taking so long in the forma-

rather than achoice both parties free-

Americaseldom has been blessed
with a finer poet than Anne Sexton,
a woman whose eerie work evolved
toward a harmony with the life/death
force which drives human nature.
Her work opens the chamber door of
the mind to beauty and fear. Her
work is sometimes not rational, but
with a deft hand she buzzes with the
bumblebees of surrealistic metaphor.
It is an entertaining fashion, but deep-
ly spirited and moved by faith. Seek-
ing meaning and faith is the most
dangerous advocation one may
choose, but sometimes its reward is
an inner vision.

Philosophically, inner visions are
unreliable, tending to be sentimen-
tal and counter-rational. The divine
and the insane aresometimes in-
distinguishable, which is why
mystical aspirants often settle for be-
ing poets.

It is not easy for a person to adapt
to being rational, to protect oneself

people do we become rational. In the
discovery of rationality, we find the
need to protect ourselves from the ir-
rational, and we produce
government.

It should come as no surprise,
however, that government cannot
confine the irrational. Rationality is
not sufficiently miraculous to explain
the mystery of life and death. in this
age, an age when rationality has
never been more desirable, its com-
mitment more needed and its
predicament more dire, we find that
the post-war dream of world peace
has been twisted into a wide assort-
ment of delusions. Christian fun-

by the press, the diplomats and the
debate societies, has been the
militarization of rationalists. Anyone
with a grasp on laws, power or in-
fluence keeps a trigger—happy finger
on the exercise of their unusual, but
reliable abilities. Hence, anyone sen-
sible enough to master the system is
indifferent enough to be very
protective.

The consequences of militarism are
a gross simplification of the human
condition and a loss ofwill in the ef-
fort to achieve a sustainable civiliza-
tion. Nowhere is this more evident
than in Latin America where poets of
right- and left-wing sensibilities are
abundant, and their lives are always
threatened. Men of peace in Latin
America, South Africa, Russia, North
America and the world over are the
easy prey of militant rationalists.

The myth of social responsibility

The collectivist philosophy has
given us no small number of phrases
and slogans. Most of them show a
lack of thought (”But all the other
kids are doing it,””My country -
right or wrong” ”Bourgeois in-
dividualism,” ’’l was just following
orders!”), but some have led entire
nations to varying degrees of disaster
(”Ask not what your country can do
for you; ask what you can do for your
country” ”You are nothing; your peo-
ple are everything” — Kennedy and
Hitler, respectively).

The most recent collectivist offer-
ing is no less impressive, if you're
easily impressed: ”social responsibili-
ty.” This term sounds lofty and no-
ble, but one must ask, ”What does
it mean?”

A response is an answer; respon-
sibility means having to answer to
someone. lndividualists such as
myself believe individuals must
answer to themselves and not to
society. Show me something society
— everybody else in the communi-
ty, state ornation — does for an in-
dividual or something an individual
did for society, and I'll show you
something done out of coercion

‘:m:- "A?

Bold

dividuals of its own volition, and in-
dividuals owe society nothing in
return.

The very nature of responsibility
makes it personal rather than social.
If one wants to live in a society
without crime, one must safeguard
one’s property and cooperate with
the police if one witnesses or
becomes the victim of a crime. Those
who want this country to be safe from
foreign attack should support the
military. Individuals who believe in
helping the less fortunate owe it to
themselves to make enough money
to afford philanthropy. Making
responsibility social distorts these
relationships: police power becomes
more important than our rights to
privacy and to avoid self-
incrimination, one’s_ social respon-
sibility to support the military could
result in getting drafted, and there is
no use for the dubious

statists who are more generous with
other peoples’ money than they are
with their own.

There is also a practical objection
to the notion of social responsibility.
How could an individual possibly ex-
pect to look out for everyone else in
the community, state or country?
Average Americans would be in a
constant state of indecision if, prior
to any action, they asked themselves,
”How will this affect my 220 million

fellow citizens?” It would be much

wiser, as well as more humanistic, to
assume that the average individual is
rational enough to be trusted to do
the right thing if left to look after his
or her own self-interest.

Every nation that accepts the notion
of social responsibility is soon struck
with the same totalitarian curses: na-
tionalized industries, secret police,
sham trials, concentration camps,
conscription, war and the abolition
of every freedom associated with
bourgeois individualism. And so,
dear reader, the next time you hear
someone prattle on about social
responsibility, look at his or her left
arm, and if you don't see a swastika
armband, ask him or her where it is.

Hot a cool Moscow jazz

advances of Soviet jazz.

Bruce Kasrel
For The Pitt News

When John Coltrane and Ornette
Coleman began experimenting with
free-form jazz, the jazz community
became a divided nation. Purists, like
myself, consider the avant-garde
movement temporary, while pro-
gressives argue that it is just the
natural step in the evolution ofjazz.
But no matter where you stand, I am
happy to report that there is a very
talented group of musicians who pro-
vide a distinct sound that might just
be the happy medium everyone is

searching for. They reside in, of all
places, Russia, and call themselves
The Ganelin Trio.

When the Ganelin Trio stepped on
the stage of Graffiti last Thursday,
very few members of the 300-plus
audience had ever heard a notethey
have played, Most were there to find
out just what Soviet jazz sounded
like. After three standing ovations, it
seemed as though the crowd was
pleased with what they discovered.

15 selected for the first North
American tour of a Russian jazz
ensemble, you could almost taste the
anticipation. The tvvo-hour show con-
sisted of only two numbers, ”Non
Troppo” and ”New Wine.” Each,
however, featured many sections that
spanned both ends of the musical
spectrum.

”Non Troppo” began with soft
cymbal work from drummer Vladimir
Tarasov with pianist Vyachelav
Ganelin blending in subtle pedal
point. Reedman Vladimir Chesakin
added short shrieks from his bass
clarinet which gave the piece an
ominous texture. The work soon
eased into a more active phase with
Chesakin flirting with blues lines on
his alto and eventually providing his
own harmony by playing a second
alto simultaneously.

The piece progressed into a
boisterous cacophony of sounds with
each member working off each
other’s ideas. Chesakin started the
flourish with a superbly articulated
and expressive sax solo, which drew
the first applause from the crowd.
Ganelin followed the solo with sharp
chords from his keyboard and then
took a drumstick and struck the in-
terior woodwork of the piano. Next,
in a violin—like fashion, he began to
scrape across the inner strings of his

instrument asthe piece reached its
climax. Before ”Non Troppo” was
complete, Tarasov pulled out a huge,
beaded necklace, which he spun

.,_ .....,.‘I..,,‘. ‘V ..,'. ., 74" 9.ngr;~wr.;.

,.,d..V, .,... .

around the rim of his snare drum.
This unusual sound brought the piece
to a close. -

Although suite-like in structure, the
sound of ”New Wine” was distinct-
ly Western. Chesakin created a four-
note melody which Ganelin and
Tarasov elaborated upon. Initially,
Chesakin was having mic troubles, so
he simply played into the bell of his
soprano sax which had a mic at-
tached to it. The chambering effect
was incredible and even Chesakin
was impressed.

Throughout much of ”New Wine,"
Chesakin’s unique antics were
featured. He played an alto solo
while marching around the stage like
a toy soldier. He then took a
drumstick and hit anything and
everything in his sight —— including
a drinking cup, mic stand, ashtray,
railings, windows, pipes and the floor
of the stage. While his comrade was
clowning around, Ganelin quietly
held the chaos together with beautiful
Afro-Cuban piano lines. This seemed
to be Ganelin’s role for most of the
evening. No matter how turbulent
the music became, Ganelin always
was there to bring it back to earth
with gorgeous lines that fell
somewhere between Rachmaninoff
and Ellington.

As soon as the vibrant music
stopped, the crowd rose to its feet

and demanded more. They got their
wish as the trio played three encores.
The first, the trio's own version of’
”Mack the Knife,” had everyone in
attendance tapping their feet and
bobbing their heads. When Tarasov
pulled out a giant sized drumstick
and a miniature cymbal to accom-
pany Chesakin on his solo, the au-
dience responded with bursts of
laughter. After two substantially
shorter encores, the trio packed up
their cases, preparing to conclude

During ”New Wine,”

their tour and return to the Soviet
Union.

Even the tour promoter, John
Ballard, was surprised by the trio's
wildly successful outing. ”The band
loved the club and the crowd, and
played one of the best performances
of the tour,” he remarked. If you're
kicking yourself because you missed
the show, the only advice I can give
is to start making travel arrangements
for a visit to Moscow.

CLO sizzles at Heinz Hall

David Zuchowski

Sta ff Writer

Last year's subscribers to the CLO
voted for their favorite musicals and
the second place vote getter Hello
Dolly is scheduled to light up the
stage at Heinz Hall beginning July
15. Based on Thornton Wilder's book
The Matchmaker, Dolly opened on
Broadway with Carol Channing in
the title role with subsequent perfor-
mances by Ginger Rogers, Martha
Raye, Bette Grable and Ethel Mer-
man. This year's CLO production
casts Jo Anne Worley in the role of
Dolly Levi. '

CLO subscribers’ favorite musical,
Cole Porter's Anything Goes, opens
at Heinz Hall on July 22 starring
Morrow and Gordon Jump. This sea-
going story includes some of Porter's
most memorable compositions in-
cluding ”|t’s De-Lovely,” ’’I Get a
Kick Out of You” and ”You’re the
Top.”

Another Cole Porter hit, Can-Can,
featuring such songs as ’’I Love
Paris,” ”lt’s All Right With Me” and
”C’est Magnifique, "centers around

popular in the Bohemian sections of
Paris. The judge's arduous attempts

infamous dance hall. Can-Can, open-
ing on August 5, promises a night of
exhilarating dance and stars Pitts-

Shadowfax
Windham Hill

Douglas Payne
For The Pitt News

‘ With their latest release,
Shadowfax attempts to create electric
tone poems and makes its bid to be
the Spyro Gyra of the ”hearts and
space.” By combining Indian

rhythms and jazz undertones,
Shadowfax’s sound is not only
unique but often quite exciting. The
spikey bass work gives the sound a
distinctive pop groove while reeds
player Chuck Greenberg is so ex-
pressive and lyrical that the overall

Windham Hill whispers

effect lies somewhere between Earth
and fusion.

Songs such as ”Maceo” and
”Streetwise” offer a disjointed and
disoriented sense of partying. Both
songs serve well as aural scores for
what they hope to convey visually,
making Shadowfax more convincing
as ”new age” mediums than fellow
labelmate William Ackerman. ”S|im
Limbo Akimbo” mixes Indian folk
ideology with a sort of Ornette Cole-
man jazz freedom, while ”China
Blue” sounds like a rhythm track
waiting for a Pat Metheny solo.

While this particular record harbors

V few out-and-out duds, the title song

and ”What Goes Around” hum
along thoughtlessly and without feel-
ing, proving that Shadowfax’s great
weakness is, perhaps, lack of inspira-
tion. The groupseems to create by
envisioning an exciting situation and
set about scoring their own imagina-
tions. Not a bad trick —— if you can
pull it off.

The title song is weighted with a
very burdening and whining guitar
solo reminiscent of early Hiroshima,

Run-D.M.C.: Walk this Way

After flinging my cats out the apart-
ment window, looting the local
Salvation Army and trashing the
neighborhood 7-11 with a Louisville
Slugger, I came back home and
replayed this sizzling sampling of
high-powered astro-rap.

Emanating from Queens N.Y., Run-
D.M.C. has helped to break down the
black/white barrriers that existed in
pop music in the '70s. Their version
of ”Wa|k This Way” is infused with
rhythm and energy that makes the
original look as washed up as the
band who performed it. Run—D.M.C.
rules.

Raw Power: Raw Power Live (LP)

I'm still trying to sign these Italian
hatecores (a cross between hardcore
punk and small children screaming

University of Pittsburgh

in agony) to next year's spring formal
here at Pitt. Raw Power rips their way
through several venomous live sets,
which feature material from last
year's Screams from the Gutter, on
this carcinogenic compilation from
B.C.T. This lonely cowpunk couldn't
figure out whether they were singing
in Italian or English.

Bronski Beat: C’mon C’mon

The Bronskis have wowed me over
with this rapid fire release of Latin
rhythms and gospel choir exuber-
ance. This is one of those classic sum-
mertime, wind—in-your—hair, girls—on—
the—beach type of tunes. Get un-
stitched and shout in the holy spirit
of the sun and the birds and the trees.

Rod Stewart: Love Touch

Even though I've never viewed any
of Rod Stewart's multiple recordings
as much more than |ess.than spec-
tacular, ”Love Touch” is a notewor-
thy exception to a never-ending
wagon train of pepless pop gluck. As
usual, Rod's raspy vocals bring
something significant to the material
he performs. In this particular in-
stance, Rodney transforms some beat
happy boogie—woogie into top of the
pops excellence as only a former
modernist could. Rod Stewart rules.

Whamlz The Edge of Heaven

I've been on the edge of my oyster
shell waiting for these squid brains
to break up. Although George
Michael possesses the ability to struc-
ture a half-decent pop song, this
flimsy flimflam could have been the
result of a collective songwriting
effort by a family of glass shrimp.

Christopher Zurawsky
For The Pitt News

Here's a band that deserves
everyone’s undivided attention. The
Outnumbered, from Champaign, III.,
are playing some of the most sincere
and socially—oriented music available
on vinyl today. Their two albums,
Why Are All the Good People Going
Crazy? and the just released Holding
the Grenade Too Long contain an in-
sistently honest and intelligent array
of powerful pop songs that’|| inflame
your brain and jump—start your heart.

The Outnumbered first left home
to open for the Mad Violets and
Prime Movers on the ”Battle of the
Garages 1984" tour. As a follow-up
to that rousing psychedelic foray in-
to life on the rock ‘n’ roll road, the
band hit the highways again in sup-
port of their first LP and made a
glorious and energetic, but virtually
unnoticed stop at the Electric Banana
in the spring of '85. This summer, the
Outnumbered are headed for New
York City, Boston, New London, Cin-
cinnati and, fortunately, Pittsburgh
once again.‘

Wider promotion and exposure
have come in both small and large
part from their record company,

‘ The Pitt News / Wednesday, July 16, 1986 / Page 7

The Outnumbered
may inflame your brain

Homestead Records, which is based
in Long Island, N.Y., and has current-
ly signed about 20 acts, including
Salem 66, Nick Cave, Naked Ray
Gun, Squirrel Bait and Big Black.
Consequently, the Outnumbered
don't receive much advertising help
because Homestead has spread itself
so thin. On the other hand, the band
benefits from the label's name
recognition and reputation. This is a
label that has proven willing to take
a chance on many progressive bands.

According to lead songwriter,
vocalist and guitar playerjon Ginoli,
the Outnumbered don't fit into a
specific division or category on col-
lege radio. He feels that their sound
is too pop for people who like punk
and too rough for the usual pop
music audience.

Ginoli compares the band's at-
titude to that of Husker Du, and said
that the Outnumbered ”look at the
bright side of things, but if things are
depressing then that's the way they
are  you've got to face them.”

In the song ”Back to Square One,”
from the first album, Ginoli sharply
reflects the group's dark spirit when
he sings, What was once liberating
has now turned sour//ust think of the

Alon -Ti McKeage and
Paul Budin of the Outnumbered

people drugs have devoured/So what
do you do when every thrill’s been
picked clean/When every frontier’s
been tamed by money and greed.
Similar laments,_ personal insights,
out-right diatribes against the system

and a blistering, friendly and pas- ,

sionate live show combine to make
the Outnumbered your best summer
music value and the most worthwhile
band around.

The Outnumbered will be appearing
at the Decade on Wednesday, july
23.

while ”What Goes Around” is
bogged down with Milton
Nascimento-esque vocals even
though the talented Greenberg pro-
vides a very good imitation of Wayne
Shorter on a bad day. ”The
Orangutan Gang” is undoubtedly the
centerpiece of the album. It employs
the eclectic magic that made much
of the group's wonderful
Shadowdance album so effective and
enjoyable. The song succeeds by
conveying a very structured view of
celebration or a very caustic sense of
an event.

Too Far to Whisper is their best bid
to a major audience and is far
superior to their previous The
Dreams of Children. The group does
have a very distinctive sound, but
unlike Prime Time or even Laurie
Anderson, it has a universal appeal
and charm. This sort of ”mood

- music” succeeds because it stands on

its own. It doesn't need a movie or
a video to enhance its message.
Perhaps the audience who is gob-
bling up Andreas Vollenweider,
Patrick O’Hearn and Mannheim
Steamroller will regard this stuff as
Muzak in 20 years, but one cannot
deny that it sells.

continued from page 1

”The next morning we held a staff
meeting, and he handed me his
resignation,” continued Posvar.

Benjamin has not been available
for comment since leaving for Min-
nesota last week.

Katherine Linduff, chairwoman of
the art history department, said
Alison Stones, Benjamin’s wife and
an art history professor at Pitt, called
her from France shortly after Ben-
jamin announced his resignation to
confirm that she (Stones) would be
returning to teach in the fall.

Stones was offered a position in the
classical studies department at Min-
nesota. Benjamin said after announc-
ing his acceptance of the Minnesota

job that his wife and children would
remain in Pittsburgh indefinitely.

Shortly after Benjamin's announce-
ment, a search committee, chaired by
current vice provost and dean of FAS
Jerome Rosenberg, was formed.

”Whether or not we actually name
a new provost, we would like to an-
nounce a candidate within the com-
ing academic year,” said Posvar.
”We would like to begin the transi-
tion process as soon as possible.”

Beniamin had been given charge
of the university plan since first arriv—

‘ ing here in I983. ”As for the five—year

plan, I drafted and personally edited
the whole process,” said Posvar.
”Whether one person leaves will not
affect something of this scope.”

Kishwar

continued from page 1
volunteer groups such as democratic
rights organizations. But all
volunteers, Kishwar pointed out,
have a common denominator. ”They
are involved themselves in acting as
a catalyst for the organization of the
more disadvantaged of society.”

Kishwar said that when Manushi
was started, people had the notion
that women's issues were limited to
abortion and rape.

Change was imminent in 1980,
when severe drought was raging in
India. Kishwar commissioned reports
on the drought conditions and said

the response she received was,
”What does a drought have to do
with women?” Her answer was that
women would be forced to do more
labor, walking six to eight miles on-
ly to return to their villages with
polluted water which posed a serious
health threat to their families.

Manushi focuses on women's
issues not because the problems of
men are unimportant, but because
”women are the ultimatetouchstone
on what's happening,” Kishwar said.

The lecture was held in the
Graduate School of Public Health's
auditorium.

Brookin to play; Barthol ineligible

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Rodney Brookin, Pitt's 6-5 basketball recruit from Steelton,
Pa., has met the NCAA’s freshmen eligibility guidelines and will
be eligible to play for the Panthers in the upcoming season.

While Brookin has maintained his eligibility, another Pitt
recruit, Herb Barthol, has not. Barthol, a 6-1 1 center from Parma,
Ohio, scored below the minimum requirement of 700 on the
SAT, making him ineligible to compete his freshmen year.

To complicate matters, Barthol has become disenchanted with
the prospect of playing at Pitt and is considering taking his
basketball skills elsewhere. '

Barthol, who signed a binding letter of intent to play for Pitt
last November, was upset when former coach Dr. Roy Chip-
man resigned on December 18. Since then, the idea of playing

 for Pitt has become less appealing to him.

Pitt coach Paul Evans would like Barthol to enroll at Allegheny
Community College in Pittsburgh and reapply for admission to
Pitt in 1987.

But Barthol has said that he will probably enroll at a junior ~

college, possibly Palm Beach Junior College in Florida, and then

transfer to a major school in two years.

Two other Panther freshmen, Chris Gatling, a 6-8 forward
from Elizabeth, N.J., and John McNeil, a 6-3 guard from Wilson,
N.C., have yet to receive their SAT results. Both players should
know within a week if they will suffer the same consequences

as Barthol.

Despite the loss of Barthol, Pitt assistant coach John Calipari
is not concerned. "We weren't counting on any of the freshmen
to come in and play, so we're not too concerned,” said Calipari.
"The loss of Barthol will hurt us depth—wise, but not in any other

way.”

Junior forward Charles Smith, 6-10, will be moved to the
center position next year, and he should do more than an ade-
quate job. That leaves a void to fill at Smith's power forward

spot.

The likely candidates for that position would be 6-8 junior
Marlon Ferguson and 6-9 freshmen Steve Maslek, both of whom

were medical redshirts last season.

Although Barthol wasn't being counted on to start next season,
he was thought to be capable of getting some minutes at the

pivot spot, which would have enabled Smith to play more often
at his natural power forward position.

Now the situation is a matter of judgment for Coach Evans
and his staff. Pitt's only true post player is 6-8 senior Tico
Cooper, who played sparingly last year, averaging 2.1 points
and 2.8 rebounds per game.

Calipari, for one, thinks Cooper can help remedy the Pan-
thers’ lack of depth at the center spot next season. "I think Tico
can help us out at center," commented Calipari. "He’s a great
kid. And remember — he had a big adjustment last season com-
ing from junior college ball."

Calipari knows what Pitt has to do in the future. "We didn't
think the new rules would affect us, but they have,” said
Calipari. "It's going to change the way we're going to recruit.
The first thing we'll do when we talk to a recruit is ask him
how he did on the SAT. If the kid says 400, then he better get
his act together or no one will recruit him.”

Calipari feels that a big problem for high school kids now
will be realizing how difficult the SAT is. "Kids get 650 or 660
on the test, and they think it is easy to bring up their score 50
or 60 points, but it's not that easy to do," added Calipari.

For The Pitt News

While some football players work
out on the Pitt Staduim turf, Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh senior flanker Chuck
Scales is busy at work in the press
box. When a football player is found
in the press box, it usually is a bad
sign.

In Scales’ case nothing is wrong.

Chuck is spending time in the press
box doing his share to promote the
Pitt football team. His summer job is
with SRO Consultants Inc., an
Atlanta-based telemarketing firm
hired by the university to help sell
season tickets.

"It wasn't something I had planned
on doing," said Scales. "I just need-
ed a job I could work around the
classes I'll be taking this summer. I
saw an ad in the paper saying, 'Are
you a sports fan? Is Pitt your team?’
It's definitely my team, and I'm a
sports fan. It's a job but it's also a way
to promote the team I play on."

Scales and the Panthers are hoping
to rebound from two consecutive
disappointing seasons. The addition
of new head coach Mike Gottfried
definitely has an effect on everybody
involved, including Scales.

"I'm very impressed with the new
staff,”said Scales. "They've taken
charge, and their attitude has
changed the players attitudes. It
seems as though things are going to
look up for the Pitt team. I think we

, season."

Scales definitely has a winning at-
titude, and he carries it with him
away from the football field as well.
In addition to being a versatile
athlete, Scales is a well-rounded
person. ‘

The fact did not escape the notice
of the College Football Association.
This year, the CFA chose 20 student-
athletes from across the nation who
set a good example for young peo-
ple to be featured on television spots
that are scheduled to be shown dur-

You've probably been here before,
thumbing through the sports section
of this or another newspaper.

Otherwise you would have skip-
ped these pages in deference to, oh,
the classified page. But you’ve made
it to the third sentence of a sports col-
umn. You must appreciate reading
long—winded columnists. You must
be standing at a bus stop. You must
have an impending dentist
appointment.

Better yet, you must be a sports fan.

An unfair assumption, perhaps, but
indeed unavoidable. Readers who at-
tentively study the news section are
never called news fans. Readers who
inadvertantly glance to the ceiling
while flipping pages are never called
ceiling fans. But readers who regular-

" ly consult the sports pages are often

recklessly labeled as sports fans.

Affirmative action is not to blame.
Rather, the blame falls upon adver-
tising agencies. They are handed
millions of dollars to conduct market
research, resulting in landmark deci-
sions which affect the lives of
everyone, determining once and for
all who is the sports fan.

The answer, of course, is you.

They study you as if you were an
economics textbook. They want to
know who you are, where you live,
how you get to work, what you do
when you get there and whether or
not you are so gullible as to actually
buy the Stubble Device.

You must be aware of the Stubble
Device, for which Wahl Clipper Cor-
poration purchased prime advertising
space in the current issue of Inside
Sports magazine, a monthly publica-
tion for people like you. You surely

noticed the large ad on page 3,
preceding even the articles about
football music videos and profes-
sional arm wrestling. You know the
one which depicts a poorly shaven
man holding a razor to his chin.

After all, the advertisement was in-
tended for you, sports fan. Look no
further than the text:

You’ve seen stubble gracing the
faces of today’s hottest. It’s easy to
get — just stop shaving.

(Pardon myvnaivete, but l never
quite considered the effect of ex—
traneous facial hair to be one
associated with grace. But thanks
nonetheless for the tip. I had forever
wondered how other sports fans
cultivated stubble.)

But it’s hard to keep — without the
Wahl Stubble Device.

(Oh)

The Stubble Device helps you
maintain the length of stubble that
looks good on you, because it’s easy
to shave clean and it’s been easy to
grow a full beard; but, it’s hard to
keep a uniform stubble day after day.

(Personally, I have never found
either shaving clean or growing a full
beard to be easy. Maybe it's just me.
My every attempt toward growing a
full beard has culminated with pat-

ches of facial hair resembling mulch.).

With the Stubble Device, you can

easily maintain the length you want
—— from a subtle one—day shadow to
a heavier five-day growth.

Finally, sports fan, your prayers
have been answered. Never again
will you have to roughly approximate
the scruffy three—day peachfuzz look.
Simply insert the proper stubble
guide. Every spectator in the
bleachers will immediately take
notice — as will your favorite female,
as will your employer.

Don’t thank me.

Thank Wahl Clipper Corporation.

Its advertising agency conducted
costly demog aphic studies to isolate
you, the sports fan, as one who could
not possibly live without the Stubble
Device. Notice it did not target the
highly paid executive or the
discriminating fashion plate. ltchose
you as someone who could use a
shave.

These degrading stereotypes persist
throughout the magazine. Consider
the advertisement for DeKuyper’s
Peachtree Schnapps, which adver-
tisers expect you to swill while
watching professional sports on cable
television. Consider the advertise-
ment for Maxwell House coffee,
which advertisers expect you to con-
sume while contemplating your
Peachtree Schnapps hangover and
horrific six—day stubble growth.

Consider the advertisement on the
back cover for Old Spice underarm
deodorant, which advertisers ob-
viously think you need.

Fact is, sports fan, you are con-
sidered the target audience for ill-
conceived razors, fruit—f|avored
booze and 24-hour deodorant — as
well as the Military Book Club,

ing the upcoming football season.

’’It was pretty exciting,” said
Scales. ’’It shows me playing the
piano, and it talks about the privilege
of coming to school on an athletic
scholorship and at the same time be-
ing able to choose a field of study.
It shows what I do here at Pitt and
what others can have the opportuni-
ty to do if they give 100 percent and
put their hearts ‘into it while they're
in high school.”

Something Scales has not done to

any great extent since his high school
days is play baseball, but that did not
deter the Kansas City Royals from
drafting him in the 23rd round of the
June draft.

’’It was one of the most exciting
moments of my life when I found out
that I had been drafted by Kansas
City,” stated Scales.

Since coming to Pitt, Scales has had
a chance to play baseball only once
a year, and that was when he would
take part in the Royals’ top prospects
game each summer. That is where
Scales made an impression on the
defending world champions.

’’I always did well,” commented
Scales. ”The Royals feel I can always
play the field and run well. Those
were the two key things they always
look for in an outfielder so they

drafted me even though I haven’t“

played since high school.”

Scales is putting his baseball career
on hold — at least for the time being.
The reason is not football, because
Chuck feels baseball and football go
hand in hand.

”My major is holding me back
from playing baseball. Physical
therapy is a major where everything
is sequential. If I didn't take this class
during this summer session, I'd be in-
eligible to continue in my major. It's
a tough decision, but it's something;
I have to do because l’m so close to
completing physical therapy."

Chuck Scales has proven himself to
be a well—rounded person based on
athletics and his work in the
classroom. Believe it or not, there is
even more t_o Scales than that. He is

Pitt may require
forward Ferguson

Assorted topics on a hot summer
day:

‘ Pitt's basketball team suffered a
minor setback last week when it was
announced that 6-1 1 freshman center
Herb Barthol will l)e athletically in-
eligible for the 1986-87 season.

Barthol's absence makes it more
apparent that Charles Smith will play
the pivot position almost exclusive-
ly next season. The interesting
thought is this: With Smith at center,
who is going to play power forward?
Does the name Marlon Ferguson ring
a bell?

‘ Speaking of Smith, his tremen-
dous play at the World Champion-
ship Games in Spain just goes to
show what kind of player he can be
when he plays with another talented
big man (Navy's David Robinson)
and a true point guard (North
Carolina's Kenny Smith).

‘ The 7-2 Soviet basketball star Ar-
vadis Sabonis is undoubtedly a great
player. How good is be? Well, the
Portland Trail Blazers selected him
late in the first round of last month's
NBA draft. But I think if Sabonis were
a full-blooded American, he would
have been the No.1 pick in the en-
tire draft. He's that good.

Smith

leading
U.S. team

Charles Smith continued his stellar
play with the United States national
team in Spain over the weekend, but
the team itself was not so fortunate.
It was shocked by Argentina in a
game Saturday that the Argentines
won fairly easily.

The U.S. basketball team shot less
than 50 percent, but Smith scored 17
in a losing effort.

The Pittsburgh Penguins have an-
nounced their 1986-87 schedule. It
appears to be a good deal easier than

C their last season.

The Penguins will open the season
with a home game against the
Washington Capitals on Thursday,
Oct. 9. They will play the New York
Rangers, another Patrick division rival
and the surprise team of the 1986
playoffs, on Saturday night, Oct. 11.
They will then leave the Civic Arena
for the first time, venturing to Chicago
for a game with the Black Hawks on
October 12.

All Penguin home games will
begin at 7:35 p.m. Saturday night
games, traditionally the Pens’
strongest attendance games, will
dominate the schedule. There are 15
home games slated for Saturday
nights. The majority of weeknight
games will be split between Tuesdays
and Wednesdays, with eight games
scheduled for both of those nights.
The remainder of the schedule will
include three on Thursday nights,
two on Friday nights and four on Sun-
day nights.

recruits

listed

Pitt's sports information office has
released the names of Bobby Lewis’
top three baseball recruits this year.

The trio will play as freshmen dur-
ing the 1987 season beginning next
spring.

One of the three is Matt Bianco, a
four year starter at Carrick High
School. Bianco had a .55() batting
average his senior year. He has not
hit below .400 since his freshman
year. Bianco was named to the Pitts-
burgh Post—(}a7ette All—Area team this
season and was also named a
member of the All—City team. Overall,
Bianco finished sixth in both city and
WPIAL batting statistics.

Another Pitt recruit is Don Kremer
from North Hills High School, just
outside of Pittsburgh. Kremer led his
team last season with a .375 batting
average. He was also the team leader
with five home runs, five doubles, 21
hits, 18 runs and 23 RBI. Kremer
.. , plans to major in pre-dentistry at Pitt.
 " ' A 1 ’  The third recruit is Denny Little, an

 All-WPIAL player out of Penn-
Trafford High School. Little broke
school records by hitting .500 his
senior year, with 28 RBI and 16 ex-
tra base hits. Little also played foot-
ball in high school.

‘ It's time for inter-league play in
the major leagues. It would especially
do wonders for the Pirates atten-
dance. The opportunity to see
American League stars, such as Roger
Clemens, Wally Joyner and Don Mat-
tingly, would be the quickest way to
spark baseball interest in Pittsburgh.

‘ Proposition 48, the new NCAA
freshmen eligibility guidelines, has
already taken its toll. Terry Mills, a
6-9 basketball All-America headed
for the University of Michigan, has
