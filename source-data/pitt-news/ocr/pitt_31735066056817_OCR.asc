On-campus crime:
Pitt vs. other city schools

Byjohn Temple
Staﬂ‘ Writer

9 (Editor’s Note: 7791's is the third
part ofa three-pom series.)

Pitt’s on-campus crime rates
compare with universities of
major cities such as University

of California at Los Angeles,

Columbia University in New
York City and Boston
University.

In aggravated assaults and
robberies, the barometers of
violent crime, Pitt ranks among
the highest of the 2,400 colleges
and universities surveyed by
The Chronicle of Higher
Fzlucalion this year.

With 26 robberies in 1991, Pitt
was approximately the eighth
highest in the nation. Robberies
fell to 22 in 1992, but the dou-
bling in aggravated assaults
placed Pitt around 15th for this
crime when compared with the
1991 statistics published in The
Chronicle.

On the positive side, Pitt
reports far fewer burglaries than
the colleges with comparable
violent crime rates.

Statistics do not give a coin-
plete picture of campus safety
—— many variables are responsi-
ble for the rates of crime. For

instance, the campus-based
jurisdiction of Pitt’s campus
police may affect the low bur-
glary rate.

Another factor determining
Pitt’s crime rates is the character
of Pitt’s campus. Pitt is a true
city school — it is often difficult
to tell where the campus ends
and the city begins.

The indeterminate campus
boundaries and the diverse mix

. of people on it increase the dif-

ficulties of the campus police in
guarding against crime. Colleges

isolated from their communities

by clear boundaries have it easi-
er. ‘

To combat the city’s rising
crime rate, the Pittsburgh Police
Department is hiring more offi-
cers and assigning many to
“community policing” duty. Pitt
Public Safety Director William
Brennan is considering getting
involved in this project, which
will have officers walking a beat
in each of the city’s 88 neigh-
borhoods and working out of
small, community-based police
substations.

Many are betting that this
return to traditional police tac-
tics may help bring about a
return to Pittsburgh's and the
Pitt campus’ - traditionally low
crime rates.

only one aggravated assault while Pitt reported 10
in 1991 and 20 in 1992.

Similar to Pitt, residents of the surrounding low-
income neighborhoods mingle with members of
the Temple University community on the city
stieets that run through the campus, according to
the university’s head of Public Safety, Charles Bush.

“Although I can’t say definitively why we have a
lower rate, I know that [the campus police] has
high visibility during peak hours, combined with

Shahla Eberhardt, chairperson of Student
Government Board’s Campus Safety Committee,
echoed the fears of many students last fall when
she said these words:

“I don’t want this campus to become another
Temple.”

Temple University, located in Philadelphia, is

widely considered a less-than-safe university to
attend, but speaking in terms of crime on campus
grounds, Pitt would do well to become another
Temple.

Both the 1991 and 1992 violent crime rates on
Pitts campus were higher than T emple’s 1991 sta-
tistics, the most recent available. Temple reported

extensive intemal and extemal crime prevention,”
Bush said. “We also work closely with the resi-
dents of the surrounding low—income housing
areas.”

The main campus of Temple has a few more
than Pitt’s 62 police officers and approximately 90
secuiity guards compared to Pitts 17.

Campus police officer helps
students learn to buy a minute

By Beth Kovaly
Asst News Editor

Over the years Curtis Smith has seen
the Pitt campus changing — changing
into a place where students must be
more safety conscious.

Smith has been a Pitt campus police
officer for almost 15 years. He has
taught self-defense at police academies
and won national awards for his mar-
tial arts skills.

This experience, he said, has led to
designing a self-protection plan, “Buy
Yourself A Minute” (BYAM), the basis
for the Basic Self-Defense course he
teaches at Pitt.

“It’s an exciting course, for both men
and women,” he said. “The women
really get a tremendous amount out of
it. It opens their eyes to a lot of
things.”

Besides basic self-defense skills, the
course includes role-play scenarios, a
crash course on defense weapons
available to the public and other meth-
ods of crime prevention.

Smith said that many people, includ-
ing students, can experience a false
feeling of security and may let their
guard down.

“Students should take heed of every-
thing that is around them,” Smith said.

“Sometimes we take things for granted
because we are living in almost a con-
trolled environment. Students have
that thought ‘It still can’t happen to
me.’ '

“People need to be more safety
minded. That comes through the over-
all process of education.”

In teaching the course Smith said he
asks students the question, “How
streetwise are you?”

“By testing their wit, the students

realize that they can be had, they can
be scammed. We always emphasize
that you survive by thy wit, not thy
brawn.

“An environment like Pitt is very _

unique,” Smith added. “You are in that
inner-city mode. A lot of students are
from smaller towns, and they have
never had this type of exposure. It’s a
totally different world.”

The BYAM program explores areas
of defense besides the physical aspect.
Smith described several classes where
he deals with the psychology of date
rape.

“I try to get some heavy dialogue
going,” he explained. “There is a fail-
ure of communication between the
sexes. It really opens the students’
eyes to things they were not aware

Air Force ROTC juniors

and seniors

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

Regardless of academic iuajor,
every junior and senior Air
Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps cadet currently enrolled
in the Profession Officer Course
is eligible to receive a $2,000
annual incentive scholarship.

The View program was
devised to enhance the reten-
tion rate of 1,900 cadets enlisted
with 158 ROTC detachments
nationwide, said Brigadier
General Robin Tornow, the
commandant of Headquarters
ROTC.

“Our search for the right kind
of people to cariy the Air Force
into the next century is continu-
ing and our goal is to keep
them on board with qualified
retention programs such as the
incentives scholarship,“ he said.

effectiveness of the ‘program as
an incentive and retention tool.

Eligible cadets must be full-
time students meeting military
retention standards and cannot
be older than 24 as of June 30
in the year of commissioning.
The scholarship provides 31,000
per semester to cover the cost of
tuition, books and fees.

At Pitt, the 70 cadet detach-
ment has received the new pro-
gram with enthusiasm.

“We have never seen a pro—
gram like this,” said Major Jeff
Thieret, the commandant of
cadets at Pitt. “It's been well
received in the detachment. It's
a reward to the cadets that fell
through the crack and didn‘t get
any other scholarship.”

Thieret explained that before
enrolling in the POC, a cadet
must complete a vigorous field
training program and then sign
a contract pledging their coin-
mitment to the Air Force.

are back in action to help
students with their tax
forms.

The University of

its four station hotline to
answer questions from uni-
versity employees who
have problems with their
1992 W-2 forms (supplied
by their employer -- Pitt).

Faculty, staff and stu-
dents who punch in their

March 16 for answers to
their tough W-2 questions.

Marrone said a large per-

said.

For university employees
and students who have
overcome the formidable
W-2, are eager to move on
and are unsure of their
next step, there is another
phone number to call.

Pitt students help build new hope

By Jenna Smoker
For The Pitt News

Imagine stepping off an airplane into
105-degree weather at 90 percent humidi-
ty, in a place where mosquitos. biting
gnats, flies. tarantulas. scorpions, hand
grenades and guns are not unusual sights.

Pitt senior Chris Staab and Pitt graduate
Beth Helfrich (lid just that last August, as
members of the group Building New Hope.

The organization was started last
February by State Representative Tom
Murphy and several other Pittsburghers
concerned about the devastation in El
Salvador after 12 years of civil war. Pitt
students and locals joined together last
spring in efforts to raise money for a two-
week trip to the Latin American country.

According to Staab. the purpose of the
visit was to help the 500 inhabitants of
rural Nueva F.speran'/.a to improve their
community. Despite being 12 kilometers
from the nearest town by cattle truck (and,
consequently. the nearest elect1‘icit_v and
running water). in eight days the group of

16 Pittsburghers built a bakery and a stone
bridge.

“The idea for us was to go and help the
people who needed help." Helfrich said, as
she went on to describe a visit to a coin-
munity of war veterans maimed for life.
who were living on an abandoned planta-
tion and trying to find a way to farm.

Helfrich said the veterans were discour-
aged and asked her what she could do to
help. “Right there at that moment, there
was nothing I could do for them,” she
said.

Staab said that the group is interested in
getting more Pitt students involved.
Building New Hope is holding fund—raisers
for another trip back to Nueva Esperanza
this August. with hopes to install a clean
running water system.

Staab and Helfrich both said they felt the
experience had changed their views on
certain things.

“It really makes__vou realize what you
have.“ Staab said. "\‘('e‘re able to have so
much because others have so little. There's
only so much to go around."

Grad students of African
descent begin new group

By Pete Oppelt
For The Pitt News

A Since the start of this
semester, African—American
graduate students and grad-
uate students of African
descent have officially orga-
nized to voice their con-
cerns and opinions after
several years of non—repre-
sentation.

The Pan-African Graduate
and Professional Student
Association, as the new
group is titled. will “speak
on issues on behalf of grad-

uate students of African
descent," according to
President Mark James.

After organizing itself last
semester with initial funding

from the Graduate and
Professional Student
Association, the group

became an official Graduate
Student Organization in
November by using the con-
stitution of the now—defunct
Black Graduate Student
Organization.

James said the term “Pan-
African" was inserted in the

Smith said that part of the
course looks at domestic
violence. He said that this is
not taken seriously enough
on campus.

“Sometimes students get
very involved with a part-
ner, and one party may
become very possessive,
and you have some bad
abuse cases that do hap-
pen,” he said. “People don’t
think of this because it’s a
college campus -—— but you
are society.

"You’re the same people
that are going to be living
around the corner.”

He takes the BYAM
program to other colleges in
the tri-state area and said he
hopes to set up future safe-
ty seminars at Pitt, which
have been held in the past.

“I’m giving people some-
thing beyond the general
information,” he said. “My

The goals of the group,

James said that pan-

African graduate students
“often feel like small fish in
a big pond” at the universi-
ty, especially at the gradu-
ate level where “there is
nothing going on.”

“People are flocking to
us,” James said. And with
approximately 120 students
already enrolled, the organi-
zation appears to be filling
a definite void. With over
500 pan—African graduate
students at Pitt, James said
he is confident the organi-
zation will continue to
grow.

The Pan-African Associ-
ation held a social gathering
on Friday as its inaugural
event

Upcoming activities include
“A Night of Soulful
Expression,” where various
forms of African culture,
such as creative writing and
poetry reading, will be pre-
sented to students. The
event is tentatively sched-

uled for Feb. 17, during
Black History month.

A “think tank” is also in
the planning. James said
this is where the problem
of retention of pan—Afri-
can students, those that
remain at Pitt to graduate in

five years, will be dis-
cussed.

James said that the
forum, scheduled for late
February, will address
the problem of only
38 percent of pan—Afri-
can undergraduate stu-

dents graduating, compared
to 70 percent of white stu-
dents.

“On the graduate level the
numbers aren’t much bet-
ter,” he said.

According to James, the
effort is fully supported by
the university and will
“bring black graduate stu-
dents together from across
the university to see what
can be done.”

“Keep your eyes open,”
James said. “You’ll probably
be hearing a lot from us.”

J  Abroad       

Last week the University of Pittsburgh celebrated its second
Cultural Diversity Week of the school year. Sponsored by the
Office of Residence Life, it mirrors the first fair of the year with
things such as food sales, musical celebrations and panel discus-
sions.

Multicultural education is an important goal to pursue. We are
reminded every day, on the front pages of the papers, of the glar-
ing realities which result frorn nationalistic tendencies. The univer-
sity has made an important step toward bridging the gaps between
peoples and fighting nationalism on a microcosmic level. Both the
ORL and Office of Student Activities should be commended in
their efforts.

But the efforts to truly understand one another can hardly occur
in a vacuum like the University of Pittsburgh. And such things like
Cultural Diversity Week and a multicultural center remain superﬁ-
cial suggestions at best. It is too easy to scream cultural diversity
when you are defining it according to your own standards.
Because of this fact, the whole notion of cultural diversity becomes
devalued and fails to be taken seriously. V

If the university and its students are truly interested in becoming
“culturally aware,” then the best Way to accomplish this is to
encourage students to study abroad. The best way to learn about
any culture is to do it on its terms, not yours. One may look at a
lion in the Pittsburgh Zoo and see what it looks like, but surely
they would understand the lion better if they saw it in its natural
habitat. ‘

Many students think studying abroad is not an option for them,
but they’re wrong. One can study anywhere in the world at a cost
very similar to that of Pitt’s tuition. It is open to all majors, and one
need not worry about graduating on time because studying abroad
will not delay completing your credits. The only way to become
culturally diverse is too make a real effort. The study abroad office
is located on the fourth floor of Forbes Quadrangle. Go find out
about it.

Powell should know better

Ever since President Clinton took the oath of office, the decision
to end the ban against gays in the military has been the hot topic

of discussion. Clinton has not only met with opposition from most

Republicans and key military leaders, but he has had a difficult
time with some very inﬂuential members of his own party. There
is no doubt that the rnuch-needed repeal would meet with prob-
lems, but it is difficult to understand the rationale behind certain
military leaders opposing the ban removal —— in particular
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell.

Regardless of whether one agrees with the ban, it is discrimina-
tory. As an African-American man who grew up during the tumul-
tuous ‘60s, General Powell should understand what it means to be
discriminated against. It simply means to be left out of things that
everybody else can participate in. Powell rose to power amidst the
turmoil of the times, but were it not for Harry Truman’s decision to
desegregate the military it is likely that the world would have
never heard of Powell.‘

No doubt there are reasons for Powell’s stance. He has served
his country well and is in a better position than anyone to talk
about what is and isn’t good for the military. But our question is,
who can it hurt? There are plenty of homosexuals in the military
who have served their country well, and they should be able to
continue without question. Powell reaped the benefits of Truman’s
decision, and it took over 40 years for him to do so. Desegregating
the military did not hurt anyone. It only made our country
stronger. This is a lesson that Powell seems to have forgotten.

War a question of petty nationalism

In 1935, Ras Tafari, emperor
of Ethiopia, stood before the
League of Nations and
declared that “until the philos-
ophy, which holds one race
superior and another inferior,”
within the practice of interna-
tional politics, is “finally and
permanently, discredited and
abandoned, everywhere will
be war.” In 1993, Ras Tafari’s
testament stands true, as eth-
nic discrimination in the inter-
national arena positions
nations at a constant brink of
war. .
One ‘example of ethnic poli-
tics can be found in the
Middle East, between the
Israelis and the Palestinians.
Ever since the 1940s, when
European warlords and Jews
decided to re—allocate the
Jewish population to a land
now known as Israel, a reli-
gious war has been in act

between the Muslims and the,

Jews. This war, ethnic or reli-
gious, was bound to occur
upon Israel’s creation, seeing
that the Palestinians, who
occupied pre-Israel found
themselves dejected from their
homes or forced into
apartheid-like, subhuman
bondage.

But the war between Jews
and Muslims in the Middle
East has existed for many
years, and the international
audience has generally accept-
ed it as natural. After all, the
creation of Israel as an ethnic
nation, is a duplication of the
origins of European nation-
states. _

The emergence of the
Caucasoid “nation-states”
occurred when their tribes
decided to form national
boundaries on the Earth and
separate themselves according
to their ethnic composure and
linguistic dialect.

Ras Tafari continued to
declare that “until the basic
human rights are equally guar-
anteed to all without regard to
race,” the same ethnic wars
would remain persistent.

Currently, a few hundred
Palestinians are stranded in
the mountains of southern
Lebanon, after being deported
by the Israeli governors. Israel
claims such action was taken
because the deportees were
“Islamic fundamentalists”
responsible for terroristic
attacks. Regardless of this
claim, the U.N. Security
Counsel passed Resolution 799

on Dec. 18, dehmandinlgvthan

Israel take back the
Palestinians or face economic
sanctions.

Ras Oscar
Eybers

So far, within the realm of
racial—ethnic politics, Israel has
not adhered to the U.N. reso-
lution. As well, the United
States, Britain and the rest of
the European Community
have opposed sanctions
against Israel, even though
they were authorized by the
United Nations. In the United
States, the Clinton administra-
tion has embarrassingly fallen
victim to ethnic politics, by
indicating its “readiness” to
block these sanctions.

As racial discrimination
poses nothing but hypocrisy,
such is the curse on the
United States, which remains
the main actor in upholding
U.N. resolutions and sanctions
against Iraq.

Ras Tafari also declared that
“until there is no longer, first
class or second class citizens
of any nation  international
morality will remain a ﬂeeting
illusion to be pursued, but
never attained.” This declara-
tion, in regard to ethnic poli-
tics, highlights this “illusion”
in a most profound manner,
both on the national and inter-
national scales. In the United
States, author William Cooper,
in his book Behold a Pale
Horse, reveals a U.S. Senate
document that discusses a
Senate hearing in which AIDS

was discussed as an “ethnic
weapon” created in U.S. labo-
ratories, to chemically remove
the nation’s blacks and other
minorities. On the intemation-I
al scale, 20,000 Muslim
women were raped by

‘Bosnian Serb soldiers in for-

mer Yugoslavia, as a strategy
to systematically “demorali2e
and terrorize” the Muslims.

While this ethnic terrorism

occurs, the United States,
Europe and the entire West sit
back and watch.

Looking back upon history,
we see that ethnic cleansing
was practiced by Hitler in his
acts o_f terrorism against the
Jews, by European imperialists
who enslaved millions of
Africans and forged the
world’s greatest “holocaust.”
Currently, we see ethnic
cleansing or destruction prac-
ticed by U.S. alcohol compa-
nies, who create so-called
“malt liquors” with excessive
alcohol levels, 'aimed at
destroying black men. The
United States is currently
engaged in an ethnic war
against the nation’s minorities,
by excluding them from text
books and including them
when historical prejudices are
found suitable. According to
American schools, one would
almost believe that the
Europeans created civiliza-
tions, instead of the Africans,
who form the genesis of
humankind. '

Hitler only gave us anti-
semitism, slavery only gave us

‘racial tension and violence,

and “malt liquors” along with
Eurocentrism only produce
violence in our cities, which
will soon spread to the sub-
urbs.

Ethnic discrimination in
politics must be abandoned,
for as we see, its only capabil-
ity is producing war, in which
all ethnic groups and races
suffer.

Pitt wrestler Sean Gibbs is focused on avenging a loss to Dave Hart of Penn State.

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

If Sean Gibbs wants inspiration to
wrestle, all he has to do is look inside
his locker.

Within “Gibber’s” ‘locker there is no
Penthouse centerfold or even a picture of
a girlfriend. Instead, inside the 2—by-6
steel box is a photo of a marked man.

He is a Nittany Lion that is wanted
dead or alive. His name: Dave Hart.

After losing a controversial match to
the Penn State wrestler at the Eastern
Wrestling League championships a year
ago, Gibbs set his goal for the 1992-93
season to beat Hart and help the Pitt

wrestling team win — in that order.

“My locker is plastered with his [Dave
Hartl pictures,” Gibbs said. “I have one
picture of the EWL championships, and
he is in first and I’m in second.”

With those pictures engraved in his
mind, the senior co—captain is showing
his best stuff this year. With a record of
23-5, the 167-pound wrestler has become
more dimensional than in the past.

The past dates back to Gibbs’ home-
town — North Canton, Ohio. Gibbs wres-
tled at Hoover High School and has seen
a big difference in wrestling styles since
he has been in Pennsylvania the last
three years.

“In Ohio the wrestlers wrestle more on
their feet,” Gibbs said. “But in

Pitt boc/eey Club dropped
by Du/ees, Slippery Roc/<2

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt Hockey Club’s
woes continued over the
weekend as it suffered losses
to Duquesne on Friday at the
Civic Arena and to Slippery
Rock on Sunday.

Pitt’s 4-5 overtime loss to
the Dukes at the Igloo dis-
gusted players, coaches and
fans alike. For three periods
of play, the Panthers out-
played Duquesne in nearly
every aspect of the game, but
they came up short in the
end.

The Panther loss negated a
stellar performance by goal-
tender Mark 'D’Amico, who
played his best game of the
year.

D’Amico stopped 50 shots,
including two breakaways and
a penalty shot, but ultimately
couldn’t stop the persistent
Duquesne attack as the two
teams entered the extra frame.

With Pitt forward Tony
Trovato serving a penalty he
received with just nine sec-
onds left in regulation,
Duquesne’s Dave Michalski
went for the jugular.

Just one minute into over-
time, Michalski stole the puck
from a Pitt defenseman right
next to the cage and went
top—shelf on D’Amico for his
second goal of the game. The
heartbreaking 4-3 final gave
the Panthers their ninth loss
of the season, dropping them
to 3-9 overall and 2-7 in the

WPCHA.

“The game was a circus,
Hockey Club President Mike
Mahoney said after the game.
“It’s bad enough when we
have to play the Dukes  the
refs were like a sixth man for
Duquesne. Mark had the best
game I’ve ever seen him play,
and it’s just a shame that the
bad officiating had to ruin it
for him. We flat out won that
game.”

A key factor in the game
was Duquesne’s ability to
minimize the offensive pro-
duction of Pitt’s leading scor-
er, Bill Crousey. Crousey
came into the game with 46
points in 13 games (5.5 points
per game average), but could
manage only a single point
against the Dukes.

Crousey’s lone point came
on a goal he scored that tied
the game at 1-1, just one
minute after Duquesne’s Kris
Adams opened up the scoring
with a goal three minutes into
the first period.

Pitt’s Trovato gave the
Panthers their first lead of the
game with 5:31 remaining in
the opening period. With the
Dukes shorthanded by two
men, Trovato knocked in the
rebound of a shot by team-
mate Scott Giordano to give
the Panthers a 2-1 lead.

Duquesne tied the game just
four minutes later on
Michalski’s first goal of the
game, which closed out the
first—period scoring.

The National Hockey

Continued from page 7

After that goal, however,
D’Amico became an enigma
to the Duquesne offensive
attack. For the next 35 min-
utes, the same Duquesne
team that scored 10 goals on
Pitt goaltenders in their last
meeting could not find a way
past this Panther netminder.
D’Amico thwarted every
opportunity the Dukes had,
despite being peppered with
32 shots.

Unfortunately, the Panthers
had as much trouble solving
Duquesne goalie Garrett
Jordan, who stopped 25 shots
over the same time span.

The Panthers’ only goal
over this long period of time
came with just over two min-
utes left in the second period.
Captain Vic Disanti set up a
screen for teammate Steve
Fisher, then managed to get
his stick on Fisher’s shot and
deflect it past Jordanto give
Pitt a 3-2 lead.

D’Amico kept the Dukes off
the board for much of the
final period, until a melee
with 4:42 remaining in the
game gave Duquesne a two-
man advantage for two min-
utes.

Pitt fans went wild as

D’Amico and the Panther
defense kept the Duquesne
power play in check for the
full two minutes‘? However,
the Dukes managed to score
before the two players who
were in the box could return
to the play.

With D’Amico sprawling to
his right to make a save, the
puck squirted loose and right
to Adams, who ﬂipped it into
the empty net for his second
goal, tying the game at three.

The barrage of untimely Pitt
penalties continued with one

minute left in regulation,

when Michalski was awarded
a penalty shot after Pitt’s
Giordano was called for
throwing his stick at the puck
in the defensive zone.

However, D’Amico was
once again up to the task. He
thrilled the Pitt faithful by
stuffing Michalski as he tried
to dent the twine with a quick
shot to D’Amico’s left side.
D’Amico kicked it away, send-
ing the game into overtime.

The hard—luck Panthers
went on to lose on Sunday to
Slippery Rock, 7-5. The game
was marred by a hugefight
six minutes into the third peri-
od that caused the referees to
call the game.

off the ice.

The owners made a ter-
rific choice in hiring for-
mer NBA executive Gary
Bettman. He will take the
league as far as it can go,
as fast as it can go. There
is only so much that a
Canadian sport can do in
Tulsa, Okla., and you can
rest assured that Bettman
will take it there.

But if he wants the
advice of a lowly sports-
writer, here are a couple
of ideas that will stabilize
and add a little excitement
to a game with tremen-
dous potential.

°Give the referees and
the linesmen the power to
call a technical foul, or
something similar, to a
player who either resists
the restraint of an official
or who skates around in
circles whining about a
call.

It looks awfully bad to
see a player who is whis-
tled for a blatant slash
encircling the official
yelling “f—-—— off, eh” and
“you’re full of s-—-, eh” in
full range of the micro-
phones. How can referees
be expected to maintain
any type of discipline
when Theo Fleury, all 2
feet 7 inches of him, keeps
chirping about a call early
in the game?

When an official calls a
tech, it should mean 30
seconds in the box. If an
umpire has the power to
give a guy a thumb, an
NFL ref has the power to
give an unsportsmanlike

conduct penalty or an NBA
ref can levy a technical _V
foul, then officials in the
NHL should be able to
give a whining player
additional time in the box.
The current unsportsman-
like conduct call isn’t real-
ly cutting it.

‘At the end of overtime,
there should be a five shot
penalty round. Each team
has five chances with five
different players against
the opposing team’s
goalie, with the highest
number winning. It’s
already done in World Cup
soccer (not the best exam-
ple of an exciting sport)
and in minor league hock-
ey across the country and
provides one of the most
exhilarating moments in
sport.

The best match—up in the
game, the one that every-
one waits in anticipation
to see, is a team’s top
scorer going up against a
great goalie —‘mano a
mano. Think about Mario
Lemieux, Kevin Stevens
and Jaromir jagr vs.
Patrick Roy; Joe Sakic,
Owen Nolan and Mats
Sundin against Kirk
McLean; or Paul Coffey,
Luke Robitaille and Wayne
Gretzky against Ed
Belfour.

Instead of depriving a
team of its one point, the
current reward for tieing,
work the system like they
do in theminors with the
winner getting two points
and the loser one.

It’s got to be better than
Minnesota’s 39 straight

overtime games without a
victory.

°Get rid of Tie Domi.
‘Nuff said.

-Give the President’s
Trophy winner a first-
round bye in the playoffs.
A series like the 1990
Norris semi—final where the
President’s Trophy-win-
ning Chicago Blackhawks
were upset by the lowly
Minnesota North Stars
makes the regular season
look like a farce. It will
give a little more credibili-
ty to the season, which
will now have a clear
objective to play for —— not
a goofy trophy and a
meaningless title.

-Two words: Dream
Team. Hey, everybody
knew who Ray LeBlanc
was during the Olympics
last year. But if it’s Tommy
Barrasso, and people see
him later on in the season,
they might tune him in.

For current hockey fans
it would be a dream to see
Kevin Stevens, Jeremy
Roenick and Joey Mullen
on a line. Hell, Scott
Young, Stephane Richer
and Eric Lindros all played
in. the Olympics, why not
Mario Lemieux and Steve
Yzerman? (Besides, I’d pay
a ton to see Rick Tocchet
take a run at Jaromir Jagr
in the corner.)

Finally, make Bob
Probert appear in anti-
gang public service com-
mercials for American tele-
vision. It would be kinda
funny.

Gibbs

Continued from page 7
Pennsylvania you find more
mat wrestlers, and I’m not
really a mat wrestler.”

Gibbs has then stayed on
his feet throughout his col-
lege career. He has “lived”
and “died” by the takedown.

“I usually beat people on
my feet,” Gibbs said. “I take
them down and I let them
up.”

But Gibbs, who had an
impressive record of 25-9
last year, said he was too
one—dimensional a year ago.

“I basically had one move
[for the takedownl last
year,” Gibbs said. “If they
[opponents] shut that one
move down, they shut me
down.”

This year, however, Gibbs
is back with a more wide-
open type of attack.

Expanding his offense,
he is ready to make a run
at his ultimate goal of
being a national champion.

But first and foremost,
there lies the responsibility
of being a team co—captain.

“Last year it was Perry
[Miller] and Scott lHovan]
who were the leaders,"
Gibbs said. “But this year,
me and Steve Budman have
come to the front and have
put stability into leadership
role.”

Panther head coach Rande

Stottlemyer said he expects
both Gibbs and Budman to
carry the team.
I “As your seniorsgo, that’s
how your team goes,”
Stottlemyer said. “We expect
a lot from Sean [Gibbs] and
Steve [Bu-dmanl.”

Expecting a lot is an
understatement.

Stottlemyer, who calls
Gibbs one of his “horses,”
expects the senior to win
every time out.

“When Coach Stottlemyer
looks at matches, he always
expects a win from me so
he can figure out who he
might wrestle at other
weight classes to help our
team,” Gibbs said.

Having this type of rela-

tionship with his coach,
Gibbs has learned plenty
from Stottlemyer.

“Coach Stottlemyer instills
the desire to win. He creates
the greatest intensity level
needed to win,” Gibbs said.
“He teaches you to go ‘balls
out’ constantly, nobody is
going to go harder than you
for those seven minutes [the
length of a college wrestling
matchl.”

Not many people have
gone harder than Gibbs for
those crucial ticks on the
clock. Gibbs has won over
70 matches at Pitt and the
count is still on as the sea-
son approaches its midway
point.

Gibbs’ solid, hard—nosed
wrestling has brought back
memories of the recently
departed All-Americans
Miller and Hovan.

“Sean is an outstanding,
flashy athlete who has a lot
of good stuff,” Stottlemyer
said.

Stottlemyer also said that
Gibbs has the potential to
wrestle on the level of
Miller and Hovan.

With all of these compar-
isons and the important
role of team co-captain,
Gibbs knows he only
has two more months to
wrestle before his career is
over.

During these two months,
Gibbs will help the Pitt
wrestling team to the best of
his abilities. I

But don’t be misled, only
one thing will be on his
mind. A Feb. 20 date against
Penn State — against Dave
Hart.

That match has been
Gibbs’ obsession since he
lost to Hart almost a year
ago. It is Gibbs’ personal
rematch, and he is eager to

show he is the better
wrestler.
“I can’t wait ‘til the

[February] 20th showdown,”
Gibbs said. “I think about it,
and Dave Hart, constantly.”

Just ask to see “Gibber’s”
locker.
