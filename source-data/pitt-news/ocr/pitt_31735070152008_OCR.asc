The forums are over. The applications are in.

But the Chancellor Search Committee has
a long way to go before it announces Pitt’s
next leader.

This journey will happen behind closed
doors. The search has entered a quiet stage,
and Pitt spokesman Ken Service said hewould
not comment on progress in the quest to ﬁnd
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s replacement
aside from the fact that a new chancellor will
be in place by Aug. 1. Service would not com-
mentwhat stage the search is in, but according
to search ﬁrm experts, the next steps are to
vet the candidates and whittle down the list
of options.

Nordenberg formally announced his re-
tirements plans injune 2013 to Pitt’s Board
ofTrustees. After 19 years as chancellor, Nor-

NEWS

Professionals speculate on progress of Pitt’ s chancellor search

denbergwill officially step down in August.

The search committee’s work with Stor-
beck/Pimentel and Associates, an executive
search ﬁrm based in the Los Angeles area
that Pitt hired to guide the committee, must
remain conﬁdential to retain candidates who
cannot publicly display interest in the job,
Service said. ‘

“There are no speciﬁc details that are be-
ing released at this point,” Service said.

Two students sit amongthe 26 members of
the search committee. Amelia Brause, asenior
and former Student Government Board mem-
ber, and David Gau, president of the Graduate
and Professional Student Government Board,
represent the undergraduate and graduate
student bodies.

In a letter to the editor published in The
Pitt News on Nov. 6, Gau urged students to
contact him and voice their thoughts on the

search. 
'\

To date, Gau said, no one has contacted
him about the letter.

On the public website about the chancel-
lor search, people can submit responses to a
survey and comments about the search to the
committee. Service said 1,033 individuals have
responded to the survey and that the informa-
tion“was consistent with the information that
surfaced in the Search Forums.” -

While Pitt will not release details about
its search, professionals in the search ﬁrm
industry were willingto discuss how universi-
ties typically search fortheir next presidents
and chancellors. A . .

Christopher Hunt, the president of HSZ

Media, a company based in Greenwich, Conn.,‘

that publishes news and the industry report
forthe searchﬁrmindustry, said about 3,000
to 4,000 search ﬁrms are active in the United
States. -
These search ﬁrms ﬁt two separate cat-

egories: retained or contingency, according
to Hunt.

Retained search ﬁrms work exclusively
with the organization to ﬁll a top-level posi-
tion. The client. pays these ﬁrms a retainer
to assist in the search. In contrast, multiple
contingencyﬁrms trytoﬁllthe position. The
client only pays the ﬁrm that succeeds.

About 1,000 to 1,500 of the ﬁrms are
retained search ﬁrms, such as Storbeck/Pi-
mentel and Associates. Hunt said retained
ﬁrms serve all institutions, including higher
education, health care, business, nonproﬁts,
scientiﬁc organizations and the government.

Hunt said no two searches for university
presidents or chancellors are alike, but they
generally share certain features.

Friends, family remember late Pitt graduate’s activism

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Lyndsey Sickler said people who met
Peter Mastracci knew how he felt about
social issues as soon as they met him.

They could tell because of the two
black horizontal bars tattooed on the
back of his hand. In socially progressive
circles, the bars symbolize equality.

“You knew, talking to him, he was go-
ing to be reasonable, open and compas-
sionate with you,” Sickler said.

Sickler, director of the Gay and Les-
bian Community Center of Pittsburgh,
described Mastracci, a 25-year-old Pitt
graduate who died Dec. 9, as a “true com-
munity advocate in every sense of the
word.” Mastracci died after his vehicle

crashed into a barrier at the bottom of '

a steep hill in Bethel Park, located in the
South Hills of Pittsburgh, where he also
lived.

The day following his death, authori-
ties determined that Mastracci commit-

ted suicide, according to Marty Coyne, a ‘

supervisor at the Allegheny County Medi-
cal Examiner’s Office. ,

Mastracci completed a bachelor’s
degree in communication and English
writing in the spring of 2010, according
to Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele.

Crystal Cristophe worked with Mas-
tracci in Pitt’s Language Media Center
until she ﬁnished her master’s degree in
linguistics in 2009. She said they became
friends aftershe saw a Facebook “note”
he posted.

In the note, he “opened up about a lot

of things,” including how he had recently

come out to his family as a gay man.

After she read the note Mastracci post-
ed, Cristophe felt that she could talk to
him honestly about her own life.

“Even though we didn’t know each
other well, I felt like I could trust him,”
Cristophe said.

Cristophe said Mastracci’s openness
about his sexuality and other aspects of

his life inspired her not to worry what
others thought about her.

The two grew closer after that.

She attended Pittsburgh Pride, an an-
nual LGBT community festival and pa-
rade, with Mastracci in 2010 and 2011.

Cristophe said demonstrators came
to the festival’s Downtown location to

carry anti-gay signs and megaphonesu

from which they broadcasted what she
described as “hate speech” that was criti-
cal of the LGBT community.

Cristophe said she was impressed by
how Mastracci and other attendees faced
demonstrators critical of the festival.

“I saw so much hatred toward [the
LGBT community] ,” she said. “It was so
brave of them.” ,

At one point, Mastracci approached
a demonstrator on the sidelines of the
parade and placed a pro-LGBT pamphlet
in his pocket before he returned to the
crowd. ,

Janet Owens, Mastracci’s mother, said

her son cared about social issues because
decency was so important to him.

Generosity was another part of his
concern for others. '

“He never made much money, but he
still gave to UNICEF,” Owens said.

Like Cristophe, other friends remem-
ber Mastracci for his activism.

Drew Wallner, who graduated from
Pitt in 2009, also worked with Mastracci
in the Language Media Center.

Wallner, and Mastracci attended the
2009 National Equality March in Wash-
ington, D.C., together.

Wallner described his friend’s mood
at the rally as “exuberant,” talking to
everyone. Mastracci and another friend
of Wallner’s who was at the rally quickly
became friends.

“The two of them were making friends,
helping people carry bags and signs, even
helping push strollers,” Wallner said in an

tion on candidates, Hunt said mostﬁrms that
search for university chancellors would start

_ out with a “long list” of 15 to 20 candidates.

The ﬁrm typically whittles this list down to a
“short list” of two to ﬁve candidates who visit
the university to tour the campus and meet
with faculty and staff.

While Pitt’s ﬁnal list of candidates is cur-

rently unknown, Hunt said to expectafemale »

candidate, aperson of color, acandidate from
within Pitt and someone from outside aca-
demia among the group of applicants who
meet the criteria. _

In a position proﬁle released by the com-
mittee last October, Pitt outlined the deﬁnition
of a likely candidate. Pitt wants candidates
who have skill in leadership and “collabora-
tive management,” use ﬁnancial shrewdness
to make academic decisions, advocacy and
fundraising and can advance the University
in research and academics.

manand Associates, anexecutive searchﬁrm
based in Los Angeles, said that after candi-
dates submit resumés, the search ﬁrm vets
the candidates by hosting interviews and
reviewing credentials.

Candidates must undergo background
checks and security clearances, and Hunt said
by the time the candidates are presented by

_the search ﬁrm, their backgrounds have been

“thoroughly canvassed.”

Hermon said secrecy becomes a challenge
during candidates’ visits to campus.

Firms work to keep information conﬁden-
tial by keeping it on private websites that can
onlybe accessed bytheﬁrmandthe commit-

Storbeck/Pirnentel and Associates would
not comment‘ on the search or if they. use
such a website, but according to notes from

‘ a FloridaA&M University presidential search
' qualiﬁcations and sub~comnﬁttee meeting in

2012, Alberto Pimentel, managingpartner of
the ﬁrm, and.Will Gates, a partner, told the
sub—committee that their  utilizes such

“The search committee is given a secure
username and password, and they can log on
and see what candidates are being interviewed
and any notes concerning the interview pro—_,
cess,” he said. _

Although Pitt’s search resemblesformer
searches and otheruniversities’ searches,
there are slight differences.

With 26 members, Pitt’s search commit-
tee islarger than most of those formed for
private-sector searches. Those typically in-
clude two to ﬁve members, according to Hunt.

Hunt said‘ Pitt’s search committee could
be larger because it is for a university and
includes members of the Board of Trustees,

but  said he has never seen a committee
with so many members. '

~“It’s really up to the university to‘make
certain that having so many members doesn’t
bog down the process,” Hunt said. _

If the next chancellor’s identity is not
announced until Aug. 1, the duration of the
search will be about one year. i _ r v

“It’s uncommon fora search to last tha
long, but it all depends.” Herman said. “I’ve
seen searches that move really quickly, and
then I’ve seen searches that take a year and
be perfectly on track.” ‘

S Hunt said universities determine the level
of student engagement in their searches.

“The search ﬁrm doesn’t block out the

V. student body or anybody from the process

as long as the collegemakes a provision for
them being part of the process,” Hunt said.

The game has stayed much the same over
the years, but Hunt said the players have
changed.

“It used to be that the president of the
university or chancellor came right out of
academia,” he said. “It would be a former

Website, Pitt blog promote healthy lifestyles for New Year  

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬁ' Writer

Students who resolved to live a healthier life-
style this new year can begin their search for
wellness online.

Active Pittsburgh, a website that cata-
logues local opportunities to engage in sports
and recreation, and the Pitt Department of
Intramurals and Recreation’s wellness blog
seek to provide users with opportunities to
stay ﬁt. Active Pittsburgh caters to the entire
city while the Pitt’s Recreation Wellness Blog
focuses on Pitt students.

Jason Miller, the assistant director of Pitt’s
Department of Intramurals and Recreation,
created Active Pittsburgh in his spare time.
The website lists events, activities and promo-
tions that users canutilizeto stay active inthe
Pittsburgh area. The site includes a blog with
stories that highlight ﬁtness accomplishments
in the Pittsburgh community.

According to Miller, he began his online
project in October 2012 as an Excel spread-
sheet comprised of ﬁtness organizations and

events that he gathered. He later transitioned
the information into an elementary website
with only a list of links. Over the last year, he
developed the site into a colorﬁilwebpage
featuring the slogan, “connecting you to all
things active,” and launched Active Pittsburgh
as a business in November 2013.

“We’re essentially a brand-new business,
but the idea took that long to develop into
something,” Miller said.

Active Pittsburgh’s basic services are all
free. Users can list organizations, events and
promotions without paying a fee, and no
membership is required to view these post-
ings. The website charges organizations for
premium listings on its activities directory,
page sponsorship, advertising and promo-
tional packages that are catered to each or-
ganization.

“I want it to be something that the masses
canuse. That’sthe difference between oursite
and others. Some sites are kind of exclusive,
where almost all of their services you have to
pay for,” Miller said.

Miller enlisted help from Michele Ingari,
who was working for WebpageFX in Carlisle,
Pa. Ingari is now the marketing director and
online outreach specialist for Active Pitts-
burgh while freelancing her services to other

businesses, as well. A team of interns also

assisted Miller to transform the website into
its current form.

Miller said the site currently lists about
1,200 organizations and receives about 100

* individual visitors to the sitedaily, which

amounts to several thousand views when
that user explores severaldiflerent pages of
the site. -
“By our standards, it has grown, because
whenlﬁrst started it, Iwas excited to see that
ﬁve people came to the site,” Miller said.
Miller said his goal for Active Pittsburgh
is for the site to become the known resource

_ for anything active in Pittsburgh.

“We’re not there yet, but I think that as
more and more people discover the site, they
realize that it really is a comprehensive one-
stop shop for that kind of thing,” he said. 7

Ingari, who became involved with ctive
Pittsburgh in September 2013, has  reased
traffic to the site through search engine opti-
mization, which makes the site more acces-
sible to search engines such as Google, Bing
and.Yahoo, and therefore more accessible
to users."

Miller said that he has also participated in
outreach on Facebook and Twitter to direct

people to the site. Active Pittsburgh has more ,

than 500 likes on Facebook and more than
1,200 followers on Twitter.» ‘

His team of about six interns includes stu-
dents interested inboth writing and market-
ing. Active Pittsburgh interns are compen-
sated with academic credit.

A “Because we’re a true startup, they get to i

be involved in the whole process of developing
a business,” Miller said.

Kayla Keddal, a senior majoringin English
writing and communications, has been awrit—
ing intern at Active Pittsburgh since March.

A recent study showed that many adoles-
cents have the conﬁdence to take owner-
ship of their sexual health when faced with
a sexually transmitted infection.

Ana Radovic, a third—year Adolescent
Medicine Fellow at UPMC Children’s Hos-
pital of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues,
Gina Sucato and Gale Burstein, conduct—
ed a survey to determine adolescents’
willingness to participate in Expedited
Partner Therapy (EPT). Sexually Trans-
mitted Disease, the ofﬁcial journal of the
American Sexually Transmitted Diseases
Association, published the study in its
November 2013 issue.

Expedited Partner Therapy is a prac-
tice that allows a patient diagnosed with
a sexually transmitted infection to pass
treatment on to his or her partner. For
instance, the health care provider either
writes a prescription for the diagnosed
patient that includes extra medicine for

January 6, 2014 I The Pitt News I vvvvvv.pittnevvs.oom

Adolescents willing to receive STI treatment, according to study

a partner or writes a prescription in the
partner’s name.

Radovic said the main beneﬁt of the
treatment is that patients’ partners don’t
have to see a doctor to receive treatment
for a mutual infection.

According to Radovic, if the patient
receives treatment, but his or her current
sexual partner still carries the infection,
then the patient can contract the disease
again through further sexual intercourse.
EPT can prevent the possibility of rein-
fection because both partners receive
treatment.

The practice of EPT varies by state de-
pending on prescription laws. In Penn-
sylvania, EPT is permissible, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website. While no law bars
healthcare providers from practicing EPT,
no explicit laws exist to regulate its use.

Radovic collected data from patients
at the Adolescent Medicine Clinic of Chil-
dren’s Hospital, located in Oakland, for

two months in 2010 during her pediatrics
residency at Children’s Hospital. Burstein
collected information from patients at
the Women and Children’s Hospital of
Buffalo Adolescent Clinic in Buffalo, N.Y.
Radovic completed the study with fund-
ing from her post-doctoral grant through
the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality, which is operated by the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services.

A total of 392 adolescents between the
ages of 13 and 22 participated in the study.

About 85 percent of participants said
they would be willing to utilize EPT if they
were diagnosed with chlamydia. This rate
was the same in males and females, as well
as patients who were sexually active and
those who had never engaged in sexual
activity. According to the study, adoles-
cents with higher levels of education and
self-efficacy were more likely to accept
EPT as a treatment option.

“I think I was surprised because you
have to be pretty mature and conﬁdent to

and International Students

be able to carry out something like EPT,”
Radovic said. “You have to be able to ex-
plain what it’s for and have that commu-
nication with the partner, so I think it just
shows that adolescents are prepared to
take initiative for their own sexual health.”

The colleagues researched adolescents’
acceptance of EPT because they said doc-
tors often apply data from clinical practice
studies on adults to clinical practice in
adolescents. Radovic said aspects of ado-
lescent psychology, including the types of
romantic relationships they have and how
close they feel to their partners, might
impact their willingness to participate in
EPT differently than adults.

According to Sucato, researchers con-
duct far fewer studies on adolescents or
pediatric patients compared to adults in
every aspect of medicine, but especially
sexual health.

email. “The sense of instant community,
safety and support among that crowd was
inspiring.”

When Lady Gaga took the stage to
speak at the rally, “Pete had to explain
to me who she was,” Wallner said.

Wallner said he held a video camera
for most of the rally, but still hasn’t edited
the hours of footage from the rally.

“When I do someday, Pete is gonna be
everywhere throughout [the video],” he
said. “That’s gonna be tough.”

Pictures from the rally show Mastracci
in a red T—shirt. “Some people are gay.
Get over it,” is printed on the front of the
shirt in white and black capital letters.

“Peter loved that shirt,” Wallner said,
who added that the shirt’s design came
from an anti-bullying campaign in the
United Kingdom.

Wallner described Mastracci as an
“anglophile,” or someone who is fond of
British culture.

Owens said Mastracci studiedfin Eng-

land during his fall 2008 semester at
Pitt. While there, he corresponded with
friends and loved ones through letters.

Writing letters was part of a lifelong
hobby for Mastracci.

Owens said he met a woman in a Lon-
don restaurant on a family trip when he
was 7 years old and maintained commu-
nication with her. He sent her his last
letter only a few weeks before his death.

Mastracci’s penchant for connecting
with strangers inclined him to get a job
as a taxi driver for a local company after
he graduated.

Owens said her son enjoyed the work,
at ﬁrst, because he could connect with
visitors to the city and act as a tour guide.

“He met people from all over the
world,” she said.

But driving a cab has its downsides.
Drivers often encounter unruly customers
and are vulnerable to robbery. V

Mastracci quit about eight months
after he encountered a drunk man who
became belligerent with him and pulled
him out of the taxi.

Owens said her son was still trying
to decide what he wanted to do with his

life, and moving from one job to another
was part of that search. He was more in-
terested in ﬁnding a rewarding job than
making money. .

Mastracci also worked in the shoe
department at a Macy’s store for about
a year, according to Owens. His last job
was a sales-associate position at Kards
Unlimited, a gift store in Shadyside.

Carly Moroski, a manager at Kards Un-
limited, said that while Mastracci worked
at the store as a sales associate, he was
always friendly and popular with other
employees.

Others noticed that Mastracci used
to draw Keith Haring’s “Barking Dog,” a
distinctive, geometric design, on pieces
of paper lying around the store, Moroski
said. 0

As a sort of inside workplace joke, em-
ployees started drawing cats and rabbits
in the same style on the whiteboard in the
break room under the store, according
to Moroski.

Mastracci also volunteered at the Gay
and Lesbian Community Center.

Sickler said Mastracci volunteered for

two years as\the secretary of the orga- ~\

nization’s executive board, leaving the
position last June.

Mastracci wrote several articles about
social issues for the GLCC.

One post that Mastracci wrote for the
GLCC’s blog about the group’s history is
one of the most popular posts on the site,
according to Sickler.

Mastracci also wrote an article for the
organization’s fall 2012 newsletter ab out
lesser—known health issues that affect
gay men.

“His quest for knowledge is what made
him write for us,” she said. «

Sickler added that Mastracci also saw

writing as a way to put social issues into 

a broader context and to explain their
importance.

In addition to his writing for activist
causes, Mastracci wrote several columns
for The Pitt News while he was a student.

In his columns, he commented on
local and national issues in a skeptical,
laid-back tone.

In a 2007 column, Mastracci ex-
pressed his regret that residents of a

in his columns, he could also laugh at

well maybe sometimes. But it’s just the

ner said. “We both laughed.”

who might be in No. 2 position, like a provost
at another university, who might be brought

over to run the whole show atthis university.” _

Hunt said typical candidates used tobe
older, white men from within academia. Re-
cently, universities have been selecting more
women, people of color and former leaders in
the private sector.

_“Itwas‘important to bringin leaders from
other industries, who bringin anew fresh skill
set into the mix,” Hunt said. “Many colleges
are run like companies. They are big, big op-
erations, and you need to someone who has

‘those, skills.” _

Pitt’s 1995 chancellor search committee
thought outside the box of academia and the
private sector and attempted to tap Colin
Powell, a retired Army General who served

as chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff from
' 1989 to 1993, for the job. '

Jim Roddejg a Pitt trustee who led the 1995
search, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in
1996 that the University had reached out to

’ Powell, who reportedly told Pitt not to con-

sider him a candidate.
Some candidates do not come from an-

” other school or the business world. Pitt’s next

leader might already be roarningthe Cathedral
halls. ._

Hunt said the best candidate for the job
might be from the University, but it is impor-
tant to conduct an intensive search to compare
an internal candidate to outsidelcompetition
to make sure he or she is the best choice.

“[Interna1 candidates] are just as much
in the running as the outsider for the job,”_
Hunt said. v

She creates feature articles for the site’s blog.

“We try to get stories about unsung he-
roes and people that overcome something.
They’re doing something active or they have
an inspirational story behind what they do,”
Keddal said.

For example, the blog featured a story
abouta man who rode a certain rollercoaster
90 times.

She said that she hoped to gain experi-
ence at Active Pittsburgh for a future career
in journalism and she received a writing job
at amagazine because of an article she wrote
for the site. ' ’

Miller said that users looking to get back
into the healthy habit can look to Active Pitts-
burgh’s winter activity guide for inspiration.

“Simply just getting connected to our site
might give them that spark to explore some
different things and become active,” he said.

Pitt alumni Alex Cappola is the division
manager of Pittsburgh’s branch of Major
League Bocce, a recreational bocce league
that began in February. Major League Bocce
began in Washington, D.C., in 2004 and has
since expanded to other cities. Members form
teams to play bocce and then socialize after-
ward at a sponsored bar.

Cappola said that Miller reached out to him
on Twitter aboutlisting on Active Pittsburgh.
Major League Bocce is now listed on the site
along with three other bocce leagues.

“I think it motivates peopleby showing
them all the great opportunities that are out
there thatthey might not know aboutwithout
Active Pittsburgh,” Cappola said.

Pitt Intramurals and Recreation’s wellness
blog also seeks to provide students with ﬁtness
opportunities. -

Ayana Elmore, a senior English Writing
major and a student employee in the Depart-
ment of Intramurals and Recreation at Pitt,

launched the department’s bloglast November
and is currently gathering content and student
contributors. She began working on the blog
in September after she pitched the idea to
department leaders and learned that the de-
partment’s employees had already intended

_ on starting a blog.

“It was kind of a mutual goal of ours, I
found,” she said.

The blogwillfeatiire stories about students
who are living healthy lifestyles, including

7 a community collaboration board where

students can share their health goals and ac-
complishments and showcase intramural and
recreation events and organizations at Pitt.

Elmore said that the blog is a tool to en-
courage overall wellness, not just physical
activity, and aid in overall awareness of the
Department of Intramurals and Recreation.
She wants to shed light on some opportuni-
ties for wellness at Pitt that students might
not be aware of.

“Society focuses our lives around that part
ofhealthy living. We’re taught that you should
be exercising daily and you should be eating

healthily, butwe’re not necessarilytaughtthat _

you should be learning how to be happy, you

should be ﬁnding a spiritual balance within’

yourself, and you should be giving back to the
community,” she said. i 4

Jessica Murray, a sophomore ﬁnance

Pitt Student Affairs’ HealthyU program. She
said that she believes it’s importantto stay
active as a college student because students
are constantly surrounded by temptations
in campus dining halls and spend most of
their time sitting down while studying. She
said that sites like Active Pittsburgh and Pitt
Intramurals and Recreation’s blogcan remind
students to stay active.

“I think it’s important because people use
the Internet all the time, so if that kind of thing
pops up regularly, it’s a good reminder,” she

“When it comes speciﬁcally to stud-

it is always a little more complicated to
study adolescents, so there are always
more studies of adults than adolescents,”
Sucato said.

According to Radovic, cases of sexually
transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea

and chlamydia, occur most frequently
among adolescents. About half of all new
sexually transmitted infections occur in
young people between the ages of 15 and
24, according to a report from the CDC
published in February 2013.

sexually transmitted infections.

Chlamydia is the most commonly re-
ported STI in the United States, and a large
number of cases go unreported, according
to the CDC. ‘

Because patients have developed more -

resistance to antibiotics, the most effec-
tive treatment for gonorrhea is currently
a shot, which a patient cannot take to his
or her partner. Resistance occurs when a

bacteria, in this case gonorrhea, modiﬁes V

itself to no longer respond to a certain
antibiotic. This generally happens when
doctors use an antibiotic in large amounts.
Health care professionals must, in turn,
ﬁnd another antibiotic to kill the bacteria.
Health care providers typically pre-
scribe one-gram doses of azithromycin,
an antibiotic, to treat chlamydia, Burst-
ein said. She added that reactions to the
antibiotic, such as nausea and vomiting,
are typically mild and unlikely withisuch

a small dose. S

tion, even Tylenol per se, but the risks
to taking azithromycin are actually very
small,” Burstein said.

Elian Rosenfeld, a doctoral candidate
at Pitt’s School of Public Health, is cur-
rently conducting qualitative research for
her dissertation to determine health care
providers’ perspective on EPT. Rosenfeld
plans to utilize information from 25 in-
depth interviews with health care provid-
ers to produce a survey for a wider pool
ofproviders.

EPT can prevent the infection of
women, according to Rosenfeld, if their
malepartners receive treatment for an
infection. She said infectedwomen are
more likely to recognize their infection
if they make annual visits to an obste-
trician—gynecologist, whereas men are
more likely to go untested and, therefore,
undiagnosed.

“I do think it is a really beneﬁcial way
to get a partner treated who might not
usually get treated,” Rosenfeld said. T

Rosenfeld said she is not surprised

' that so many adolescents said they would

participate in EPT.  ‘ ‘
“Nobody wants to have an STI, and

treating a partner is a great way to prevent
that,” she said. '

If patients choose not to participate in
EPT, Radovic suggests they use Sotheycan-
know.org as a resource to help them notify
their partners of an infection.

So They Can Know is a website that
offers people scripts to help guide the
conversation about an infection with a
partner in person, via phone, text message
or email. The site also enables users to
send an anonymous email to their part-
ners to notify them of a possible infection.

Jessica Ladd, the executive director and
founder of the nonproﬁt Sexual Health
Innovations, developed the. idea for So
They Can Know about four years ago af-
ter teaching sexual education. Ladd and
other volunteers launched the website in
September 2012. Since its launch, she said
about 19,000 users have visited the site.

“One of the things that would always
come up with my students when Ilwas
talking about STDs was that the idea of
symptoms or further disease or health
complications didn’t really freak anyone
out,” Ladd said. “But the idea of having
to call up and tell everyone you’ve slept

with that they need to get tested was ter-
rifying.”

She said the site does not store any
information about users or their partners,
and she hopes to add an anonymous text
messaging feature by March of 2014. Ladd
added that 92 U.S. clinics — a majority
of which serve patients under the age of
26 -— promote So They Can Know.

Ladd said that while patients should
ideally notify their’ partners themselves,
it is not always a patient’s best option. She
said current partners typically utilize EPT,
while anonymous‘ notiﬁcations could be
more useful for past partners.

“If you had a bad break up, if you’re
worried about your partner getting vio-
lent, something like that, then maybe
anonymous notiﬁcation is the better an-
swer,” she said. ,

Ladd said she hopes that partners who
receive medicine or a prescription though
EPT still get" tested for an infection.

“They don’t necessarily knowwhether
or not they actually got it or whether or
not they actually have to go and tell their
own partners unless they have an actual
diagnosis,” she said. I

OPINIONS

Grade inﬂation poses serious
risks to collegiate performance

COLUMN

Simon Brown
Columnist

I A much—publicized announcement by a

senior academic administrator has given
new meaning to the old alma mater, “fair
Harvard.”

In early December, Harvard’s Dean of
Undergraduate Education substantiated
the accusations of hyper-competitive
ivy-leaguers when she announced that
the most common grade awarded in Har-
vard classrooms was an ‘A,’ while the
median grade hovered close by at ‘A—.’

Besides motivating the highly infor— 7

mative “What would my Harvard grade
be” webpage, this announcement has
resuscitated a national discussion on the
trend dubbed “grade, inﬂation.” Since
the mid—198os, average grades at all uni-
versities and across all disciplines have
consistently increased. But rather than
unveiling some Ivy League conspiracy
or the collapse of classroom expecta-
tions, these shifting numbers result from
broader budgetary and administrative
trends in higher education.

While grade inflation has never been
a secret, the “easy ‘A”’ at Harvard —— a
name synonymous with rigor and exclu-
sion —— struck a national nerve. When
the admissions ofﬁce claims that only 6
percent of applicants to the school can
succeed at Harvard, yet the university
awards those select few who are accept-
ed with more grades in the ‘A’ range than
all other ranges combined, it doesn’t
reflect well on Harvard’s meritocratic
mystique.

This loss of credibility has motivated
peer institutions to take administra-
tive steps to deﬂate the ‘A’ bubble. In
2004, Princeton mandated that no more
than 35 percent of its distributed grades
could fall within the A range. Now, after
Princeton has seen fewer applicants than
rivals Yale and Harvard, the president
plans to reconsider the policy, since

the tougher scale has “become part of
Princeton’s image for applicants,” ac-
cording to The Daily Princetonian, the
university’s student newspaper.

This trend’ presents two branding
options for any university. By actively
curbing grade inﬂation, they can ensure
that their most successful students stand
out above the mediocre, thereby grant-
ing their straight-‘A’s greater currency
in the pursuit of jobs, fellowships and
graduate degrees. If Harvard and Princ-
eton admit that most of their students
deserve ‘A’s on a regular basis, then they
can’t claim that the education they pro-
vide is qualitatively different from one
that grants only the best students the
same reward.

On the other hand, they could alien-
ate prospective applicants by expecting
the highest standards. And not just tal-
ented applicants, but those who would
choose a college simply on account of
easy grades‘. Even though they’ll never
get accepted, their applications will still
lower the all—important acceptance rate
— the key to that coveted No. 1 ranking
on U.S. News and World Report’s an-
nual list of the country’s best colleges,
which has ﬂuctuated between Harvard,
Princeton and Yale for years.

No matter which branding strategy
universities choose, it is clear that stu-
dents’ diligence and intellect are not
the only variables indicated by grades.
And buried beneath all the reputations
at stake in a single grade, from universi-
ties to departments to professors, each
individual student is barely noticeable.

This anxiety about reputation doesn’t
only allow universities to shrug their
shoulders at the gaping grade bubble
staring them down, it encourages in-
structors and departmental chairs to
do the same. For non—tenured lecturers
concerned about their ratings on OMET

UGG line provides consumers style, warmth at the expense of
immoral, inhumane manufacturing processes

Natalie Russell
Columnist

“The typical UGG boot wearer is normally a
thin white female with long blond hair and,
in most cases, a fake tan,” so says Urban
Dictionary. According to a survey taken

on Pitt’s campus last month, she is also
completely unaware of the materials from
which her shoes are made.

Just 15 of the 50 female Pitt students
surveyed correctly guessed the primary
material that makes up this ubiquitous foot-
wear: sheepskin. When questioned, Deckers

Outdoor Corporation, parent company of
UGG Australia, insisted that the sheepskin
is derived “humanely” as “a byproduct of
the meat industry.” The company’s website
published a list of their contract factories
in December 2013. Six out of the seven sup-
pliers for Stella International Holdings Ltd.

which our products are made.” China, a
country where cats and dogs are frequently
slaughtered for food, has virtually no legal
establishment of animal welfare. In Ghana,
the laws are questionable, though admit-
tedly not quite as monstrous.

Another defense that Deckers continual-
ly pushed was the strictness of the Supplier
Code of Conduct document. Though the
document goes to great lengths to ensure
workers rights, there is absolutely no men-
tion of animal welfare. In other words, Chi-
nese manufacturers can starve and abuse
sheep without violating any government-

instituted laws, thus not overstepping

Deckers’ ethical boundaries. Video evidence
from undercover reporters working with
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
offers even more support for the treatment
of sheep used in the meat industry.

The video shows sheep experiencing
cruel treatment on Australian farms (where
many sheep are bred before skinning) and
even worse at the slaughterhouse: having
their limbs cut off while still conscious and
their throats slit for a long, agonizing death.

Before slaughter, sheep are castrated
and have their tails removed. Many even

undergo a process called mulesing, which

involves cutting off the ﬂesh from the back-
side of a sheep to prevent ﬂystrike — a
condition where ﬂies lay their eggs and
hatch ﬂesh-eating maggots on parts of the

animal with high concentrations of blood, ~

urine and feces. Although Deckers Outdoor
Corporation claims it doesn’t trade with
suppliers who practice mulesing, many
of the sheep farmers that supply the wool
come from Australia, where it is completely
legal and commonjlyilpracticed.

Australia is home to some of the biggest
suppliers of wool, much of which comes
from Merino sheep, who are not native to

COLUMN

M- Dogft be passive, complaining produces better outcomes

Channing Kaiser
Columnist

I think I need to start complaining more.
I’m more of a go-with-the-ﬂow, accept-
whatever—comes type of person, but I’m
starting to realize that perpetual whiners
know something I don’t: The more you
complain, the more you are rewarded.
‘Complaining holds power. If enough
people join together and complain at
the same time about the same thing,
rallies and riots manifest. America is an
entire country that runs on complaining.
Writing a civil letter to your congress-
people about your qualms won’t get you
anywhere, butstaging a large, colorful
protest in D.C. just might. V
0 I learned this lesson the hard way.
After a semester abroad in India, two
eight-hour ﬂights and nine hours’ worth
of layovers, I was ready to catch the last
plane home when the ﬂight was canceled
and I was forced to spend the night at

O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.
I was upset, butwhat could I do?'So I
bought a granola bar for dinner, found
a place to sleep and called it a night.
As it turns out, there was a lot I
could’ve done. The guy ﬁve rows in front

. of me called the airline and made such a

fuss that the company gave him a $1,000
voucher. My dad, who ‘was traveling at
the same time I was, tweeted about his
own set of delays at the airline and re-
ceived a $75 gift card. '

And what did I get for accepting

. the situation with an attempted smile?

Nothing, not even a bag of stale airplane
peanuts.

As a former food-service employee, I
can vouch for the merits of complaining.
I was taught that the customer is always
right, so even though you deﬁnitely did
not specify dressing on the side, I will
throw out the salad I gave you and get
you a new one, free of charge. Whatever

you complain about, I am obligated to
try to ﬁx.

At one restaurant I worked for, pa-
trons would Photoshop fake coupons,
print them out and try to redeem them,
and we were forced to honor them. God
forbid they complained on the customer
survey, forcing us to receive a bad quar—
terly report.

Thanks to the Internet, complain-
ing has never been easier. Nowadays,
you can complain on the go from your
iPad,_"ph_one orKindle. That guy on the
7’1B7who is smacking his gum a little too
loudly!r_ight in front of you? Quick, tweet
about it and hope for some sympathetic
replies. Is the line too long at Rita’s?
Take‘ an upset-looking selﬁe while you
wait,Ctag Rita’s in it and see if you get
free custard.

Companies and restaurants are so

‘paranoid about saving face that the more

publicly you complain, the more you

stand to reap. Companies work hard
to maintain their online image — Taco
Bell is known for its witty tweets and
responses to customers —— and will go
out of the way to retain its public appeal.
So go big or go home; if you are going to
make a stink about something, don’t just
write a letter. Smear it all over social me-
dia and see what kind of rewards you get.

If you do n’t want any reward for your
incessant whining, though, the Internet
allows. you to complain, anonymously,
meaning you can be as vulgar and in-
accurate as you want with little to no
repercussions. People bash online videos
and articles and ask prying questions
all because they can do it anonymously.
It is much easier to be a jerk when you
know that your mother will never ﬁnd
out what you said.

Gone are the days of tolerance and

the region’s climate. Sheep are bred into
genetic mutants to produce as much wool
as possible. This overgrowth leaves sheep
vulnerable to infections and diseases, which
is why mulesing is necessary and practiced
in the ﬁrst place.

To be fair, this unethical treatment is
common in the meat industry, so Deckers
might be telling customers all they need
to know when they call the manufactur-
ing of UGG boots “a byproduct of the meat
industry.” This phrase (parroted by every
Deckers representative I spoke with) was
apparently concocted by public relations
experts as the best psychological formula
for drawing out the collective sigh of uneasy
customers.

Rather than calling into question the
cruelty of the meat industry, this phrase
is largely considered to be unproblematic.

It’s why the PR pros came up with it in the
ﬁrst place. In the average American moral
code, sheep slaughtered primarily for their
skin is wrong, but if they’re being used for
food, too, well I guess that’s OK.

Eating meat is such an ingrained,.social-
1y-accepted part of American culture that
it’s easy to adopt the ﬂimsy arguments for
it as a means of maintaining the status quo.
And it’s madeeven easier by corporations
who don’t want you to know what went
into the ﬁnal, polished product. Just take a
look at the frozen McRib photo that went
viral last month.

Worse than public concession of the
meat industry is the defeatist attitude — the
one that says, “Well, my iPhone and clothing
came at the expense of suffering, too, so why
bother?” It’s true that ethical decisions in
most cases (especially with buying electron-
ics) are difficult to make without simply
going off the grid, but a meat-free diet isn’t

laxity under so many pressures, none
seem able to decide what a grade actu-
ally should measure in ideal conditions.

The knee~jerk answer seems obvious:
student performance. But if every year
a university admits more students with
greater preparation to perform well on
examinations —— say, Pitt, which boasts
application pools with increasing GPAs



and SAT scores each year — shouldn’t
the grades increase across the board?
And would the university be providing
a better education proportional to the
incoming class’s merits if that were the
case? _

To address grade inﬂation, it will
take more than an ‘arbitrary percent-

Love’s Crushing Diamond

‘Sounds-like: What love must

You could’ve argued that saying “I love
you,” in 2013 would have been seen as
some sort of sick joke, yielding a defen-
sive “Why?” Somehow a universal cyni-
cism crept into the year’s most benign
conversations as the world ostensibly
crumbled around, us. The Internet-
media behemoth called into question

everything from the racial implica-
tions of Macklemore to Beyonce’s role
in feminism, making it difﬁcult, really,
to believe in anything — especially the
lofty, abstract ideas that our parents,
the alleged creators of all our current
problems, championed.

This is what makes Love’s Crushing
Diamond, the fourth full-length proj-
ect from the Boston-by-way—of-Austin,
Texas, folk group Mutual Beneﬁt, one
of the year’s best records.

On the album, the millennial obses-
sion with questioning everything that
made Miley Cyrus the year’s hottest
topic turns on itself. This begs the ques-
tion “Why do we still fall in love?” with
the same wide—eyed, boyish charm that
made Sufjan Stevens an indelible ﬁgure
in early 2000’s indie music.

Mutual Beneﬁt treads lightly, though.
Much like how Stevens’ religious un-
derpinnings never felt anything short
of wondrous, Love’s Crushing Diamond
successfully basks in the fact that, de-
spite everything, we know absolutely
nothing about why anything happens.

Album opener “Strong River” tiptoes
on an array of sonic elements gently
crashing in what sounds like prepa-
ration. The song blooms at the two-
minute mark with singer-songwriter
Jordan Lee’s whispered declaration “I
clear my mind of joy and sorrow/ river
doesn’t know tomorrow.” Lee’s song-
writing is both simplistic and compli-
catedly braided. “Golden Wake,” the
album’s second track, bleeds from the
first as Lee howls, “We weren’t made to
be afraid,” beneath the band’s delicate

orchestral motions.

In a lot of ways, Mutual Beneﬁt came
out of nowhere. Outside of the frankly
overcrowded folk circuit in Austin, the
band had little in terms of a following.
A ﬂood of promotional emails to online
outlets with the album’s third track “Ad-
vanced Falconry,” however, managed to
catapult the band, rightfully, into the

public conversation.

The song is perhaps the album’s most
personal but also its least descript. On
it, Lee gently drones, “But I won’t for-
get the way she flies,” about the song’s
existential subject. This isn’t a love song
where someone longs for some angel-
ic — and problematic —— “she,” but ‘a

Pittsburgh's City of Asylum a
bastion for persecuted writers

Matt Singer
Sembr Staff Wrz'ter

Israel Centeno has written several books: 10
of them, in fact. However, it was his 2002
work, “El Complot” that lost him his coun-
try, his home and his former life.

Forced to ﬂee his native country of
Venezuela because of political pressure
and intimidation, Centeno now resides in

Pittsburgh. His new lifestyle is signiﬁcantly n

different than the one to which he was pre-
viouslyaccustomed, but he’s able to write
and lives in an environment in which he and
his family are safe. This is thanks to City of
Asylum Pittsburgh. -

City of Asylum Pittsburgh is part of an
international network of programs that
provide shelter _to exiled writers. If politi-
cal or social forces cause a Writer to feel
threatened, or they are forced to leave their
country, City of Asylum helps the writer by
providing shelter‘ and safety for as long as
necessary. » ‘C

In Centeno’s case, City of Asylum Pitts-
burgh is the preferred option to his home

in Venezuela, where he and his family felt

threatened. Centeno recounted being as-
saulted on the street multiple times and,
in one instance, being left with a broken
arm. He said that when he left his country,
he was considered “a menace.”

Now that he is under the wing of City

~ of Asylum, however, things are different.

According to City of Asylum Pittsburgh’s
Marketing and Communications Manager,

..-up-vxwn- ego--n 1.; z-~.aen---vw . -- ——.r 7

Elizabeth Baisley, the program shelters one
or two exiled writers at a time, providing
them a rent-free house, ayliving stipend and
health care. Additionally, City of Asylum
Pittsburgh provides additional services,
such as legal aid, translation services, job
placement, language lessons and “whatever
it takes to enable the writer to progress to
a stable and independent life as a writer

_in exile.”

Exiled writers, Baisley said, are permit-
ted to retain their housing for as long as they
wish. Their individual spending stipend and
medical care is limited to two years. City of

Asylum Pittsburgh, she said, “is supported *

through the generosity of individual do-
nors —— a [community of people right here

in Pittsburgh who believe in the cause of '

protection of persons and of human rights.”
' Founding — ' l
The international City of Asylum net-
work has its roots in the mid 1990s, when
world-renowned author Salman Rushdie

and a band of other writers realized they ‘

might be able to work together to provide
their fellow authors with safety from per-
secution. Rushdie, who authored the con’-
troversial novel “The Satanic Verses,” which
includes a biting portrayal of the Prophet
«Muhammad, was forced into hiding in 1989

when Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah

Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against
him. Along with his colleagues, Rushdie’s

goal was to give aid to writers who found ’

themselves in similar situations, and who
were subsequently unable to publish their
work or continue writing or felt as if they
were in danger.

In 1997, Rushdie spoke in Pittsburgh

about the International Cities of Refuge ‘

Network, which he and other writers had
begun to establish in Europe. Diane Samuels
and Henry Reese were in attendance when
Rushdie spoke in Pittsburgh that day. They
contacted the International Cities of Refuge

Network in Europe with the hope of estab— '

lishing a branch in Pittsburgh.
At ﬁrst, they received no response. How-

. ever, they continued to express interest in

the potential for a City of Asylum in Pitts-
burgh. Finally, in 2003, they were able to
begin work with American author Russell
Banks, who was working on expanding City
of Asylum network to the United States.

The United States network is currently
made up of chapters in Las Vegas, Ithaca,
N.Y., and Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh’s branch of City of Asylum

E2’

was founded in 2004, and has since oper-
ated a sanctuary on the North Side. Since
then, City of Asylum has expanded its ac-
tivities. It publishes an online magazine on
Sampsonia Way, which Baisley describes as
“a journal devoted to literature, free speech
and social justice.” It also organizes pub-
lic readings by international writers and
works on collaborative projects with local
organizations.

“For a variety of reasons, we think that
the creation and development of commu-
nity plays an important role in the exiled
writer’s progress toward a stable life in exile.
We believe that we’re fostering a community
of writers, readers and neighbors here on
the North Side,” Baisley said in an email.

Most importantly, however, City of Asy-
lum allows the exiled to continue their work
as writers. '

The writers

In its ﬁrst year of operation, City of
Asylum Pittsburgh brought Huang Xiang
and his wife to Pittsburgh. Having suffered
through time in prison and even torture
for his poetry, which was critical ofChina’s
cultural revolution, Xiang ﬂed China after
continued persecution. He and his wife

remained with City of Asylum until 2006.

Other writers soon followed. Novelist
Horacio Castellanos Moya ﬂed El Salvador
and arrived in Pittsburgh in 2007, followed
by essayist Khet Mar and her family,who
left Burma in 2009.

Baisley said that each instance of a writ-
er coming to City of Asylum Pittsburgh is
unique. Sometimes, the writers reach out to
City of Asylum Pittsburgh and apply for the
organization’s residency programs. Other
times, she said, Postsecondary Education
Network International or the International
Cities of Refuge Network recommends writ-
ers to the program. .

The process of then coming to City of
Asylum Pittsburgh starts with theprogram
helping writers to obtain the appropriate
visas and secure transportation. Next, the
organization arranges for the writer — and,
if accompanying them, their family — to
live in one of City of Asylum Pittsburgh’s
on-location homes.

The two writers currently taking reﬁige
with City of Asylum Pittsburgh are Centeno,
and Yaghoub Yadali.

Centeno has been working on a trilogy
and a separate novel since his arrival in

2011. His work “El Complot” is currently
being translated into English.

“This is my work,” said Centeno of writ-
ing. “This is the thing that I love to do.”

“El Complot” is a ﬁctional dystopian sto-
ry in which the political climate ofvenezuela
drives some citizens to try to assassinate a
ﬁctional president. Upon its publication in
2002, then—President Hugo Chavez’s party
interpreted Centeno’s work as a call to ac-
tion that encouraged citizens to follow suit
and attempt political assassinations.

“In this novel, I talk a lot about the ex-
treme left wing of my country,” he said,
“and some people assume that I am talking
about them.”

Centeno maintained that his novel was
a work of ﬁction, and said that he never
mentioned Chavez’s name in the story.

Yadali, the other exiled writer currently
involved with City of Asylum Pittsburgh,
is an Iranian ﬁction writer and television
director. He was accused of insulting one of
his country’s minority groups because of a
love affair between the lead character of his
novel “The Rituals of Restlessness” and a

that although Iran’s Ministry of Culture and

Although mounting public and interna-
tional pressure caused him to be released on
bail, he ultimately lost his job and left the

writing at Chatham University with aj-1

of cultural exchange.

City of Asylum Pittsburgh’s goals

Baisley said that City of Asylum Pitts-
burgh believes it’s up to the community as
a whole to ensure that the right to express
one’s beliefs is maintained.

“The protection of that right is the re-
sponsibility of the community at large,”
she said. “Art, literature, free speech, com-
munity: all part of the equation.”

Yadali agrees that artists should be able

limitation put on free expression “would
draw back engendering creativity, and also
thinking and writing.”

He pointed to censorship as an example
of one kind of limitation, comparing it to the
constant ticking of a clock inside a writer’s
head. The writer, Yadali said, must actively
work to reject the tick—tock, so as to be able
to write their actual and genuine thoughts.

Yadali thinks that without having come
to Pittsburgh, he wouldn’t be able to write
in such a way.

“If I hadn’t come to Pittsburgh, Iwouldn’t
have a space to respire. Iwouldn’t work on
whatever I want. Ifl hadn’t come here, I
would not be able to freely speak my mind,”
he said. g“Here, I write whatever I think,
without any limitation and pressure.”

Although there are only six individuals
currently on the City of Asylum Pittsburgh
staff led by founders Reese and Samuels,
Baisley said that the program is more con-
cerned with providing substantive aid to
writers for as long as they so need it, rather
than just temporary help.

“Rather than focusing on emergency re-
lief and providing a temporary way-station
for an exiled writer, City of Asylum Pitts-
burgh is committed to helping endangered
writers build a new home and a stable life,
as writers —'it is very important that they
continue to write, that they are not silenced
either by threat of danger or the circum-
stance of exile — in a community,” she said.

astonishment at the abstract possibility
of falling in love.

Lee moved from Austin to Boston to work
with his sister’s wedding photography
company, he told Pitchfork.

“I’ve been doing this for so many
years that I can’t look at pictures of
people getting married every single day
and not believe in love,” Lee said.

You could’ve argued in 2013 that Lee
was in the minority for his belief. Though
much of society feels we’ve grown be-
yond needing another person to be
happy, by the end of “Love’s Crushing
Diamond,” you can’t deny that knowing
it’s still possible to believe in love makes
love seem that much more probable. I

Panthers begin ﬁrst ACC season with Win at NC State

Jasper Wilson
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

RALEIGH, N .C. — Anthony “Cat” Barber

grabbed the loose ball and sped down the
gcourt, his dreadlocks swinging back and
rforth behind him.

Flying by both his teammates and op-
ponents, the North Carolina State guard
ﬂoated toward the basket for a layup.
Fouled on the play, he made the shot and
the resulting free throw.

That single offensive sequence illus-
trated a theme that played out often over
the course of the ﬁrst half during Pitt’s
inaugural Atlantic Coast Conference game
in Raleigh, N .C., which it would go on to
win 74-62. That theme was speed.

“We came out fast. They came out fast.

They were a little bit faster than us,” Pitt
freshman forward Michael Young said.

The Wolfpack (10-4, 0-1 ACC) sprinted
to a 15-point advantage and Pitt struggled
to keep up.

But the Panthers (13-1, 1-0 ACC) ad— -

justed as the ﬁrst half went on, closing the
deﬁcit to eight, 34-26, by halftime.
The Panthers took their ﬁrst lead of

_ the contest a quarter of the way into the
second half in a manner belying the pace

of the game — on a fast break connection
between redshirt senior forward Lamar
Patterson and redshirt junior guard Cam
Wright, 40-38.

Patterson led Pitt with 22 points and
also grabbed eight rebounds and handed
out six assists.

knew N .C. State wanted to get out in transi-
tion — it was the only way they could win
— and so they weren’t surprised when the
Wolfpack did just that. The host’s initial
success in this approach was made easy
by Pitt’s offensive woes. In the ﬁrst half,
Pitt made just a third of its shots, going
9-of-27 from the ﬁeld. T

For Patterson, the root of the atrocious
start was clear.

“We were just missing shots. They were
open shots,” Patterson said. “If we’d hit
more jump shots, they might not have got-
ten so many transition buckets.”

The Wolfpack scored nine fast break
points but dominated points in the paint
20-8.

Summing up his team’s ‘overall perfor-
mance during the ﬁrst, Pitt head coach

Jamie Dixon said “we ,couldn’t have been
worse.” . 
And yet despite that poor performance,

- single digits midway through the game. '
That small difference meant that, when
the team did right its wrongs after the
break, the results came quickly.
_“.We adjusted well when we started at-
tacking the rim,” Patterson said.
Another change that helped rid t L
Wolfpack of their preferred offensive style
was Pitt’s improved effort rebounding. Af-
ter getting outrebounded 22-12 in the ﬁrst
half, Pitt would win the second half 17-13
with Talib Zanna pulling down a game-
high nine boards,as well as 15 points.

Loss to Cincinnati mars end of non-conference schedule

Nate Barnes, Patrick McAteer
and Tyler Pecyna
The Pitt News Staﬁ“

Pitt 91, Youngstown State 73

Pitt rolled to its 10th straight victory to
start the season, capping the fall semes-
ter’s ﬁnals week with a 91-73 win against
the Youngstown State Penguins. Pitt (10-
0) pulled away in the second half, building
a lead that totaled as high as 26 points at
the expense of Youngstown State (7-5).

Kendrick Perry entered the contest
averaging more than 20 points per game
and lived up to his billing as an offensive

weapon by scoring 28 points against Pitt _

on 11-of-18 shooting.

“We’ve seen pretty much what he can
do,” sophomore point guard James Rob-
inson said. “Obviously we didn’t do that
good of a j ob on him, but we were still for-
tunate enough to come out with the win.”

Pitt’s depth helped the Panthers over-
come Perry’s scoring, as ﬁve Panthers

registered double-digit scoring. It was
the fourth time this season that Pitt had
ﬁve players score 10 or more points.
Lamar Patterson led Pitt with 18 points,
while Cam Wright scored 13, and Der-
rick Randall po_sted 11 off the bench. Talib
Zanna and Mike Young each scored 10.
The Panthers dominated in the post,
out-rebounding the Penguins by a 47-21
margin. Zanna recorded 15 boards,while
Randall and Young each added seven.
“Our goal is plus—20 every game on the
rebounds,” Young said. “When you have
that goal every game, you set that mindset,
it doesn’t matter who your opponent is.”
The Panthers achieved that goal and

out-performed head coachjamie Dixon’s ~-

own expectations for how Pitt would com-
bat Youngstown State near the basket.

“I thought we should beat ‘em,” Dixon
said. “I don’t think I anticipated that much,
but I felt we would beat them and should
beat them on the glass.”

Youngstown State head coachjerry Slo-
cum anticipated that the Panthers would
pose challenges on the boards, and his
foresight was proven correct.

“We couldn’t handle their strength and
physicality,” Slocum said. “That’s a team
that just manhandled us down there.”

“Physicality and defense and rebound-
ing the basketball is what they do well.”

For the Panthers, the 73 points scored
by the Penguins was the most Pitt allowed
to an opponent in a single game this sea-
son, and the ﬁrst time Pitt allowed a team
to score more than 70.

“They scored 73 points. That’s obvi-
ously disappointing to me,” Dixon said.
“We’ve gotta improve defensively. I’ve been
saying that.”

Cincinnati 44, Pitt 43

After Pitt won the opening tip against
Cincinnati, the Panthers endured a rather
odd possession. Ofﬁcials stopped play
three times within the ﬁrst 10 seconds

because of issues with the game clock,

drawing a host of boos from all in at- .

tendance who made the trek to Madison
Square Garden to see the continuation of
a now-extinct Big East rivalry.

As it turned out, this lack of offensive
ﬂuidity didn’t end after the team’s ﬁrst
possession, nor did it end through the
entirety of the game as the Panthers lost
to the Bearcats 44-43. Pitt (10-1) lost its
ﬁrst game of the season to the Bearcats
(8-2), who had lost two straight games
before the evening’s contest.

“We didn’t‘ play well, and we didn’t de-
serve to win,” Dixon said.

That might have been an understate-
ment. Over the course of the game, Pitt

’ made only 11 ﬁeld goals, marking the worst

performance for the program since 1939.
Fortunately for the Panthers, their 19
made free throws, compared to Cincin-

Young Panthers shine in Little Caesars Pizza Bowl victory

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The 2013 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, played
at Ford Field in Detroit, Mich., featured
four lead changes andthree ties. On De-
cember 26, the Pitt Panthers were the
ﬁnal team to make a change when Chris
Blewitt drilled the game-winning ﬁeld

goal from 39 yards out for a 30-27 Pitt
victory against Bowling Green.

Just 1:17 was left on the clock when Ble-
witt made his third ﬁeld goal of the game,
but the Falcons faced a fourth-and—4o
afterjames Conner drew a holding pen-
alty, and Ty Ezell and Aaron Donald each
sacked Bowling Green quarterback Matt

Johnson.

Blewitt’s go—ahead boot was set up by
impressive, record-setting efforts from
freshmenjames Conner and Tyler Boyd.

“We obviouslyhave some great young
talent, and that’s why we are so conﬁdent
about the future of this program,” Pitt
head coach Paul Chryst said. “We think

we’re in great shape going forward.”
Conner earned the bowl’s Most Valu-

able Player honors after he rushed 26

times for 229 yards and a touchdown.

Conner’s yardage total sets a new pro--

gram record forrushing yards in a bowl
game, beating the 202 yards Tony Dorsett
ran for in the 1977 Sugar Bowl. 1

“Coach told me they wanted to unleash
me on both sides of the ball,” Conner said.
“They kept giving me the ball, so I just
kept running.”

Boyd ﬁnished with eight catches for
173 yards and set the record for receiv-
ing yards in a season by a Pittfreshman.
The true freshman from Clairton, Pa.,
ﬁnished his season with 85 receptions for
1,112 yards, which tops Larry Fitzgerald’s
previous record of 1,017.

In addition to receiving, Boyd re-
turned a punt for a touchdown from 54
yards out in the second quarter, which
put the Panthers up 17-3. It was the ﬁrst
punt return for a touchdown by a Panther
in seven years. A ‘ .

’ Boyd tiptoed along the sideline at the
end of the run to ensure he would be able
to score.  A

“I knew I had to stay in-bounds be-
cause I’m not in the goal-line package?’

’ Boyd said. “If I stepped out, I wouldn’t

get the chance to score.”

But after Boyd’s punt return, the Fal-
cons scored 14 straight points to tie the
contest at 17-17. The teams went back-
and—forth until the Panthers were able
to strike the deciding blow.

Redshirt freshman quarterbackChad
Voytik also provided a glimpse of the fu-
ture at the quarterback position, playing
the second half behind center after Tom
Savage suffered a rib injury in his ﬁnal
game as a Panther.

i Voytik connected with Boyd for a 62-
yard bomb as part of a 98-yard scoring
drive, and Voytik kept the football on a
bootleg for a 5—yard.sjcore“to cap the drive.

Savage was ,8-for-13 for 124 yards be-
fore his injury. Voytik threw for 108 yards
on 5~of-_9“‘passing in the second half.

The Panthers’ win gave them a 7-6 ﬁn-

nati’s' one, gave them an opportunity to
take home a win in the ﬁnal seconds of
the Jimmy V. Classic. ,

With about 1:30 on the clock, Wright
scored on a layup, putting the Panthers

ahead 43-42 and closing what had been "

a ﬁve—point deﬁcit. Pitt forced a stop on
Cincinnati’s next possession, generating
an opportunity for the Panthers to poten-

tially extend their lead.

‘When redshirt senior forward Lamar

Patterson went to the foul line for two
shots, this seemed well within reach.

But Patterson, who entered the game
shooting 77 percent from‘ the foul line,
missed both foul shots, giving Cincinnati
the ball with about 20 seconds left on the
clock.

“I took that under the chin for the
team,” Patterson said. “That was deﬁ-

. nitely on me.”

Patterson scored 11 points Tuesday,
while Zanna led Pitt with 12 points.]ustin
Jackson scored 12 to lead Cincinnati.

 

January 63,2014 | The Pitt News I vvvvvv.pittnevvs.com

But in the game it was Sean Kilpatrick,
the Bearcats leading scorer, who scored
seven points to stake Cincinnati to a late
lead. »

And on the game’s ﬁnal play, Kilpatrick
missed a shot on a drive to the basket,
which was then rebounded by forward
Titus Rubles.‘ Rubles ﬂipped the ball in the
basket for a 44-43 Bearcat edge with about
four seconds left on the clock. 1 _‘

Dixon called a timeout to draw up a ﬁ-
nal-second_ play, but Wright, who received

’ the in~bounds_ pass, was unable to get free

and was forced to launch a shot from half-
court, which fell well short of the basket.

“We wanted to attack it with 4.2 sec-
onds,” Dixon said. “There was not a lot of
time, and we wanted to draw someone and
hopefully ﬁnd an open man. We needed to
be in a better position.” ' _

Although the Panthers struggled

mightily from the ﬁeld, shooting only‘

31 percent, their poor rebounding was
the deciding factor in Pitt’s ﬁrst loss of

p 2013. Cincinnati out-rebounded Pitt 35-

27, marking the ﬁrst game in which the
Panthers failed to out-rebound their op-
ponent this season.

“We are trying to improve on every-
thing, and we did some things better de-
fensively,” Dixon said. “The rebounds is
the thing. It’s hard to believe you can get
out-rebounded that badly.”

Even for Wright, who has played at Pitt
for three years, the performancewas an
anomaly.

“We just weren’t the same team today,”
Wright said. ‘You hate to say it, but it was
one of those days.”

Pitt 73, Cal Poly 56

Patterson provided a vehement re-
sponse to Pitt’s ﬁrst loss of the season, as
he scored 30 points in 30 minutes to lead
the Panthers.(11-1) to a 73-56 win against
Cal Poly (4-7).

“I had no doubt that he wouldn’t re-~

spond in a positive manner,” head coach
Jamie Dixon said. ‘‘.He’s been so good all
year long.”

Patterson helped key a 14-2 run, which

gave Pitt a 22-8 lead with 7:33 left in the '

ﬁrst half. Patterson re-entered the game
and drilled a pair of 3-pointers, then con-
verted an and-one chance after he was
fouled on a‘ layup when Zanna found him
cutting to the basket. '

“I saw the ﬁrst one go down, and they
gave me another look, so I shot that one,”
Patterson said. “Talib hit me on that cut,
and I did a good job just following through
for these guys.” '

Aside from Patterson, Durand John-
son was the only other Panther in double
ﬁgures with 12 points off the bench. Pitt
shot more than 46 percent from the ﬁeld
and accumulated 19 assists on 27 made
baskets.

The increased eﬂiciency marked a se-
vere improvement over the previous game,
when the Panthers shot 31.4 percent at
Madison Square Garden. Dixon empha-
sized patience, which manifested itself
in Patterson’s big game.

“The shots he took were all wide—open
and usually after a pass or ball-reversal
movement,” Dixonsaid.

Cal Poly stayed close and pulled within
three points of Pitt in the second half at
37-34. But like many times before, the
Panthers pulled away again and continued
to build a 17-point lead.

ning rampant, extending their lead to as
many as 24.

Young credited the team’s collective
defense as the key to the turnaround.-

“In the second half we just played our
game, got defensive stops. Our defense
led to our offense, we just ﬂowed,” Young
said. “It feels good. It’s ﬁin to get stops.

The freshman was the third of his team-

mates to ﬁnish in double—digit scoring with .

13 points. He attributed the early struggles
to it being the ﬁrst “big” game the team has
played since the team lost to Cincinnati
at Madison Square Garden in December.
“We came out really amped, and ev-

erybody was kind of allover the place,”'

Young said. “We just needed to slow the
game down and play at our pace. I think we
were playing at their pace, or the pace the
wanted us to play at, in the ﬁrst half; Once
it slowed down, and it was at our pace, we
got things rolling.” I

BREAK

with Pitt because of solid 3-point shoot$
ing early on, making ﬁve of their ﬁrst 13

atternpts. But Pitt managed to eliminate

its defensive breakdowns, and Cal Poly

, made only 2-of-13 the rest of the way.

Meanwhile, Pitt continued to wear

downjoe Callero’s Mustangs while build— g

ing a 17-point ﬁnal margin.

“I think the physicality of the game
caught up to us,” Callero said. “I think our
legs went out a little bit. You could see Pitt
getting stronger in that period — shots,

- rhythm, feel of the game.”

But the story of the game was Patter:
son, whose 30-point game was the ﬁrst
for a Panther since Sam Young scored 32

against Oklahoma State March 22, 2009, .

in the NCAA Tournament. The perfor-

mance was also the ﬁrst 30-point game .

scored at the Petersen Events Center since
Young scored 33 against Belmont Nov.
25, 2008.

Pitt 58, Albany 46

Albany head coach Will Brown fo-
cused on Robinson and Patterson when
he prepared for the Great Danes’ matchup

, against Pitt_on Tuesday.

V Brown knew there would be certain
players the Panthers would rely on to
hit jump shots, and he knew there were
players who could do a little bit of every-
thing. He lauded Robinson’s and Patter-
son’s ability to distribute the basketball,
a trait he explained to his players, noting

that the two Panthers could do so while .

rarely losing possession.
