Total Elimination
f ‘Dead Wood’

Recommended
By JIM NELSON

Student Government Pres- v
 ident Richard Sobota present-

ed an outline of his progress
in eliminating “dead wood”
and overlapping areas in the
executive branch of SG.

At the Senate meeting Monday,

_ Sobota recommended that the so-

cial committee, headed by chair-
man Ralph Marino, be eliminated.
and that Judy Gebhardt fill the
position of director of major
events. which was formerly held
by Ben Wood. A

Barbara McKeever will ﬁll the
post of corresponding secretary of
the Senate in place of Gail Reyn-

S i Olds.

Sobota proposed that the office
oi’ executive secretary be created

and that Marilyn Trapani ﬁll the .

position.

The Senate voted to accept the
replacements, and to‘ set up the
post of executive secretary.

The remainder of his report
outlined and defined the execu-
tive committee positions, pointing
out the exact areas in which the
directors shall work as well as
their speciﬁc duties.

Librarian Speaks

Lorena Garloch, the head of the
University library, spoke to the
Senate concerning their recent
discussions of library hours.

The complaint of the Senate
is that the present library hours
are not long enough, and that
the libraries are not open on
Friday nights and Sunday after-
noons.

Miss Garloch said that surveys
of students using the libraries
show that during the times in
question the majority of students
use the library facilities to study
their own texts and not to use
reference books and other facili-’
ties provided.

Important Study Area

It was the opinion of the Senate

that the library is an important

--W: study area as well as reference

area and that it should be open

at these hours to facilitate the

need for a place to study.

Library Permits
Open To Seniors

Senior undergraduate students
may now obtain permits to use
the closed stack areas of the Uni-
versity's main library.

Eligible students may receive
permits by presenting their stu-
dent invoice, signed by the regis-
trar, to the circulation desk on
the 5th floor CL. The permit must
be approved and signed by the
student’s advisor.

Tours of the stacks will be con-
ducted from the Circulation desk
everyday at 3 pm.

This proposal was madesby the

slow in registering could turn

the first day of the winter trimester into one vast mob.
Anthony Athens, assistant director of student records,

ts are very slow in registering

this time and that they may create mass confusion on Janu-

ary‘2, the ﬁrst day of the winter trimester.
--9

“This could be the best regis-
tration ever." Athens said. “if they
will register in time.” Course
election records are due in the
Office of Student Records on No-
vember 22.

As of November 13, 6500 stu-
dents had not yet registered for
ie winter trimester. Liberal
Arts and Engineering students
not yet registered numbered
1152.

Smooth registration is hampered
also by the number of students
who want to change courses after
they have registered, Athens said.

William French. an undergrad-
uate advisor, said that he had en-
countered no great number of stu-
dents requesting course changes,
but that those who did want the
changes were of an indecisive na-
ture. unsure about their vocational
goals.

Athens urged students who
have not yet registered to avoid “
confusion and long lines on Jan-
uary 2 by registering as soon as
possible.

Last year, after three weeks of
registration. the School of Engi-

Sigma phi Epsilon 4 po-lmsp. andaneering and Mines was the only

undergraduate school with more
than half of its students registered
for the winter trimeste_r.

At that time. Richard M,
Hodges. director of Student ‘Piec-
ords, urged the rest of the students
to register within the three weeks
remaining. Enough of them did
not heed his warning and the be-
ginning ot the trimester last Jan-
uary was chaotic. .

Hodges cited weaknesses in the
advisory system as the reason be-
hind the clumsy registration last

year, when he found that one out

oievery ten schedules had defects
in them.

Maguire said.

Polish Philosopher
Speaks on Politics

By SUSAN ECKMAN

The department of Public and International Atl'airs
sponsored a talk by Dr. Marian Dobrosielski, counsellor of the
Polish Embassy, Friday at 4 pm. Dr. Dobrosielswi, a doctor
of philosophy, attended the University of Zurich during WW
II and came to the U.S. in 1957  Secretary of the Embassy.

Dr. Dobrosielski tried to explain the Polish point of View
on many modern political prob-  vi 
lems. He said that Poland had ,
taken the road to socialism be-
cause of the “necessities of life.”

stems from “national interests”;
Russia gives them aid and guar-
antees their b()i‘(l.€l“S among other
things.

He emphasized that “peaceful
oo—existenc.e is alreadg a social
fact,” and that the problem or
e o m m u n i s m vs. capitalism
doesn’t concern interstate rela-
tions. “It is an ideological and
social question and must be de-

' aided by the people.”
lDobrosielski especially stressed
disarmament and gave examples
of Poland's efforts to speed its ac-
complishment-a plan for the de-
nuclearization of Cent1"a.1 Europe
which would be conducive to
“complete and general disarma-
ment.”

But he added that the chief
stumbling block was German mil-
itarism which was revived in the
German Federalist Republic.

Asked, in the question-—and-an-
swer period, about the resumption
of Russian nuclear tests be said
that Polish reaction wa the same
as everywhere»!-—shock. le thought
himself realistic, not seeing the
world in black and white but real-
izing that there is right and wrong
on both sides.

He said that Russia was
against the exploitation of rev-
olution, but would “look at rev-
olutionary movements with sym-
pathy.”

Speaking about Polish relations
with the US he said that it 
an “experiment in peaceful. co»-3
existence.” The states can ‘‘re--‘,;
spect and understand each other
without interlerring in internal
affairs."

  Homecoming

Homecoming has always been a time of parties, ﬂoats
and fun. And while this year is no exception as far as the
scheduling is concerned, the alumni are returning to a far
different University from the home of their college days.

In the past four years, the changes in physical plant
alone are enough to cause even the most recent graduate

to wonder if he’s in the right place. But the addition of the.

Student‘ Union, Langley Hall and a gaping hole beside the
Schenley Quadrangle are not the only noticeable changes
to be encountered by the grads.

For the ﬁrst time in many years. no elaborate ﬂoats‘

will circle the football ﬁeld in a halftime show of Greek

skill and endurance. Instead alumni will circle the campus,

inspecting colorful housefronts of their younger brothers.
Another ﬁrst that will greet this year’s visitors is the

addition of dorm students in the weekend competition for

outstanding papier mache work, once a purely Greek con-
test. Even more important, alums will have the oppor-
tunity to meet dorm students and inspect a quickly develop-
ing campus school. '

The importance of the above events reflects the fruits
of 174 years of change and progress which will evoke some-
times nostalgia, sometimes pride in the students of past
generations, for Homecoming is, after all, for the alumni.

But one thing that will never change at any university
are the students. This year’s students have again shown
themselves to be" outstanding hosts and hostesses by the
programs they have scheduled. But if the weekend is to be
the success it should, the enthusiasm shown by the organ-
izers of all its phases must be transcended by students all
over campus.

Elaborate programs with puny audiences defeat the
whole purpose. A college is more than modern buildings;
it is students. They cannot divorce themselves from the
happenings around them. Their participation is essential
to give the true ﬂavor of this University as a college of peo-
ple as well as buildings. It’s one of the most important tra-
ditions we have left.

Anti - Intellectualism

By Nathan Firestone

Amid all the optimistic reports of University
expansion plans emitting from the Chancellor’s
ofﬁce, disquieting rumblings can be heard from our
neighbors surrounding Pitt.

They accuse the University of such lesser crimes
as planning to take over Oak-
land, to such major offenses as
plotting to deﬁle the sacred
the 1960 World
Champions by erecting a library
somewhere between third base
and the centerﬁeld monument.

Without taking into account
the legitimate complaints voiced
by many merchants at the
thought of their business areas
being torn down and the discom-
fort caused by relocation, I —
would suggest that this is all part of a larger pat-
tern of anti-intellectualism in the United States.

The University is not the only college in the
country facing this sort of antagonism. Aside from
“prestige” schools and colleges that entirely sup-
port a small surrounding community, most other
institutions of higher learning are faced with the
same sort of outside bitterness.

In contrast with European society, where the
intellectual element is placed on a relatively high
level, the “practical, hardworking, individualistic”
businessman has always been placed on the highest
plane of the social scale in the United States.
Meek Type

During the l,9th Century, the college professor
was looked upon as a meek, harmless type, incap-
able of doing any real harm. But this “free” at-
mosphere in which the practical entrepreneur could
make a fortune starting with very little came to a
close before World War 1. Much of what America
considered to be really American, i.e., rural U.S.A.,
laissez faire of sorts, and the almost complete dom-
ination of socio-political life by white Anglo-Saxon
Protestants, saw its power base crumbling. There
were many factors leading to this: unrestricted im-
migration in the last half of the 19th century, a
more sympathetic attitude for reform, and the large
inﬂux of Negroes to serve the industrial needs of
the North during World War I.

The image of the intellectual swung away from
that of the harmless professor to that of a cunning
“bookworm” plotting to take the ﬁner things in
life away from those who had worked so hard
for them. '

 

The depression, New Deal, thelbrain-trusters,
and the adoption of Keynesian economics of sorts

solidiﬁed this image, but it was temporarily pushed 

into the background as the needs for unity in the

face of a second world war overshadowed an *7

other considerations.

With the end of the war and the ﬁrst realiza-

tion of the communist danger, the bitterness against

 
 

intellectuals again found its outlet. Many of these ~ 

“professorial types” had been aﬁiliated with left
wing causes during the 30’s, and were also the
same ones pressing for the second front during the
war. This served as a convenient excuse for taint.
ing the entire academic community. And this is
exactly what happened during the McCarthy era,
The vigilante red—hunters went after college pro;
fessors and the more intellectual element in the
State Department. ,

The mistakes and lies of the Lattimores and the
Hisses were used to cast doubt on the loyalty of the

entire “egghead” class in the United States. Public.

Egghead No. 1, Adlai Stevenson, ran for the presi.
dency twice, and was defeatednot only by the.
strong Eisenhower image, but also by the picture
of Stevenson showing him to be a thinker, far re-
moved from the practical matters in life.
Blasting Columnists

The latest blasts against intellectuals, reflected ‘

in such newspaper columns as those by Henry
Taylor, Sokolsky, and Mrs. Walter Ferguson, place
the blame of the Cuban ﬁasco squarely at the feet
of President Kennedy’s advisors (the Harvard
Gang.)

That and the frustrations of being unable to i

get a clear decision in the struggle with commu.
nism, have generated a strong revival of anti-in-
tellectual sentiment in the United States, especially
in the area of political thinking.

This is evidenced by a wide-spread acceptance
in our right wing element of candy-makers, pro-
fessional soldiers, and retired businessmen, as the
ﬁnal authorities on the strategies of communism.
And coinciding with this, comes a rejection of the
advice of Kennan, Bohlen, and other real students
of the communist empire.

As the major part of the University community,
we feel anger at the outside resentment toward
Pitt. But if we incorporate this into a larger pat-
tern of anti.—intellectualism in the United States,
one develops the feeling that the American people
are determined to ﬁght an ideological battle with
the trusty ﬁintlock against an atomic howitzer.

Pitt Views

Prince has charged that University students
are the epitome of apathy . . . Not true at all

. . . Who could miss all those Pitt students
who cheered for Notre Dame at the last

ly consolidated production and distribution
processes . the same has happened in
Chicago and in Portland, Oregon . . . It's a
national trend, and the day of the poly-
papered city is over . —. . It’s a confusing sit-
uation, but this may be the best thing that’s
ever happened to the P-G . . .

Holes in Pittsburgh streets cause holes

of trouble last week when they attempted to
launch a chimpanzee into outer space . . .

If the beast had died, would the newspapers
write up his obituary? . . . At any rate, the
chimp could be replaced by a less valuable
passenger . . . ,

Drill Team

Places

First in Competition
The University’s Pershing Riﬂes Drill Team placed high-
est to win the ﬁrst place overall trophy award in the Villa-
nova Navy ROTC Invitational Drill Meet in Philadelphia, Pa.
In the last four years the University’s PR’s have won 37
national, state, and local awards.
A Nine other schools were represented by Pershing Riﬂe

teams as well as
Force, and Navy ROTC teams:
Fordham. Georgetown, La Salle,
New York State Maritime, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Prince-
ton, St. Joseph's. Xavier, and
Villzmova.
Place in 2 Divisions

In the Exhibition or Trick Drill
division of competition, the Uni-
versity PR’s placed first, with 830
of a possible 900 points. They
placed second to Villanova in the
Standard Drill division. having
806.6 points, 1.4 points less than
the winners. 1

Cadet Jay W. Shircr attained
154 points of a possible .200 in
the Individual Drill competition.

The maneuvers performed by
the Trick Drill team were done
with the M-1 rifle and an l8 inch
sharpened b a y 0 n e t. together
weighing 101“-_: pounds. and were
the same as those done at the
Pitt-Navy football game.

National Champions

The Villanova Invitational was
held earlier han most meets, as
the season is from February to
May.

Villanova split the Trick Drill
competition into two divisions,
according to the way the teams
had placed in the National
Cherry Blossom Meet in Wash-
ington, D.C. rather than having
open competition. ,

The teams that placed 20th or
above nationally were Class A,
and those that placed 2.1-st or be-
low nationally were Class B. The
"University PR team was nati.onal
champion Pershing Rifles team in
the 1961 Cherry Blossom Festival.

Clapp Ha   ‘orthy of Name’

By MATT SWETONIC
Just inside the main en-
trance of the University’s
modern Natural Sciences
building on the corner of

Fifth and Tennyson Aves. is 
mounted a large plaque ded- 

icating the structure to one of the
most prominent men in the long

history of the University, George :5

Hubbard Clap p.

Clapp was born December 14, 

1858, in Allegheny, now part of

, Pittsburgh’s North Side. , _ .
At 16, he enrolled at the West-

ern, University of Pennsylvania,  

now the University of Pittsburgh,

where he studied science. In 1877,  A it

he was graduated with the de- 

gree of bachelor of philosophy and
was named a. “ﬁrst scholar” in~the
scientiﬁc department.

After his graduation he worked
ﬁrst at the Penn Cotton Mill and
later spent several years with
the Black Diamond Steel Works,
where he was employed as an as-
sistant ‘to Capt. Alfred. E. Hunt,
who was head of the open hearth
department.

‘Hunt and Clapp became friends,

into a partnership as a ﬁrm of
consulting chemical engineers. "

Book Center Exhibits

Etchings, L

itho graphs

By JOSEY GROSSMAN
A display of lithographs and etchings by contemporary

American and European artis

ts of the Paris school is now

on display in the Fine Books Room of the Student Book

Center. _ '
According to Robert Berg

man, initiator of the program,

the Book Center is trying to show exhibits of various forms

of graphic art for the students and: '

community. '

Because the prints—including
those of Marini, Appel, Za-Wou-
Ki, Sugai, and Friedlander——were
bought directly from the art pub-
lisher in Paris, “interested cus-
tomers can buy them at compara-
tively moderate prices,” continued
Bergman. The prices range from
$20 to $125. .

“The fact that over half the
prints have already been sold
since the display began last
week, shows that the program
has been successful and that we
are serving a prevailing need in
the community,” added Berg-
man.

This display was selected to tie
in with the International Art Show
at Carnegie Institute, where some
of the graphic artists are showing
other works. \

Since these prints are limited
editions, with the stones. from the
lithographs and the copper plates

a certain number are made” and
signed by the artist, they have in-
creased market value in addition
to their artistic worth.

By the end of this month, there‘
will be a display of Eskimo sculp-

ture from the Canadian Eastern

Arctic on Baffin, Island. This will
be followed in January by a show-
ing of Eskimo prints.

known as the Aluminum Com-

Elected Trustee

Clapp served the ﬁrm succes-
sively as treasurer, secretary,

; vice president, and member of the

board of directors.
Although his career in busi-

V ' ness and industry is noteworthy,

he is now known more for his ,
interest in scholastic affairs
than anything else.

Clapp was elected a trustee of
he University in 1902, and was
president of the board of trustees
from 1907 until his death. During
is time his signature validated
46,846 diplomas. .
“ During his years as head of the
board of trustees he made many
contributions to the Nationality
Rooms which he called “the great-
est experiment in Americanization
the world has ever seen.”
Clapp died in 1949 after more
than 47 years of continuous serv-
ice to the University.

“It Goes On

 

WHY WE DON’T WIN

Phil Fumble, 3 knowing gent Who, plays football for the
University of Pittsburgh, was running like agfaucetin‘ the
dressing room after Notre Damehad inﬂictedlthe sixth lick-
ing of the year on the*Panther’s hide. ' ' ’

Phil fumbled with hiswords a, few minutes, his tongue
twisting inagony as he tried to. spit the venomous words out.
He implied in a garbled bellow that had Mike Ditka, last
year’s captain, been in the dressing room on Saturday and
witnessed the reaction of some of the Cats to the loss at
the green“ hands of the Irish, someof the players‘woul.dn’t
have been in the dressing room for long.

In other words, there‘-may have been some human sil-
houettes cut out of the brick walls ala cartoon strips. “(J ohn)
Yaccino wouldn’t have had the guts to whistle if Ditka .had
been here,” Fumble remarked. T
They Don't Care

“You know whywe aren’t winning?” Phil ﬁlled us in.
“There are too many ‘guys aroundhere that are just putting
in time. They don’t care ifyou really win. Come up and
watch us -practice some night, you’ll see.

“The second team hustles, the third team hustles,
and the fourth ’ team hustles,”_ he “continued, “but the
ﬁrstoteam just goes through the motions. The sopho-

, mores are! still making mistakes,'. and even they quit
‘hustlin’ once they get elevated to the ﬁrst team.

“No. ﬁrst-stringer worries about his job, they’re in. We

, never have to scramble for jobs.” This may have somelogic,
‘ because the coaches are constantly bemoaning the fact that

they’re forced to use guys that are playing below par, because
they have no one else. ’

_ On Doghouse Lisl-

,‘,‘l-Iow can they justify playing a guy like that (Dave)
Maestro?” Phil Fumble spoke up. We admitted that we were
pretty dumbfounded after watching him through binoculars
for ten straight plays against Navy. “He was on the dog-
house list ‘for the early part of the year because of his atti-
tude,” Fumble remindedus. “They didn't even take him to
fall camp. Solthen they play him, and he just falls on the
ground at the snap of the ball. This kills ‘guys that are try-
ing in practice.” '

Then Fumble ﬂopped his weary frame on the bench,

and went on: “No one can tell me that (Bob) Clemens

' isn’tltaking it easythis year. His leg isn’t hurting that
bad, but he doesn’t'ﬁgure to do anything if he does play
now, so that’s no loss. He’s just another guy that has
grown gun-shy, and plans to maintain his scholarship by
coming to the trainer’s room every day.” T —T

We thought that Woody Haser, who played well against
Notre Dame in his ﬁrst game since the Baylor kick-off,
might have been able to do the same thing this season with
a legitimate excuse, because he was really hurt. But Haser

r is "of a different caliber. yAs Dr. Smith, the team physician

told. us, “hejwas playing on tape and a prayer.”

Tech Be-Her

I

 

After talking with Phillip P. Fumble last saturday I

am convinced that Carnegie Tech has ‘a better football team
. than Pitt, because they have more guys playing on the team

that really want to play, and no hangers-on. _ "
Maybe we ought to cut out athletic scholarships.

Then” there would be nobody on the football team who V

doesn’t want to play.

Washington Held

So. Cal. Scoreless

The Panther gridders will
try to regroup their forces
once again this week and try
to convince themselves that
there is ‘such a_ thing as a
game victory. The team has
been frustrated so many times
this year, it’s beginning to think
a victory is out of the question.

“Call us the giveaway kids,”
Gary Kaltenbach said. “It’s some-
thing new with the trimester plan.
Everyone says wait ’till next year,
wait ’till next year. Well, I’.m
tired of waiting. Of course, the
future is all anyone asbad off as

we can look forward to.”
There were no serious injuries
reported from the Notre Dame

"fracas, and this is unusual. Still,-

the spirits may bebroken by now,
and the Panthers will have a
tough time getting mentally ready.

Q , Frustrated Foes
- The Southern California team
that comes here on Saturday dur-
ing Homecoming weekend is an-
other force that had a frustrating
year, and they will be anxious to
make reprimands for their early
failures. .

In the Notre "Dame game the
‘Panthers’ ground game was next
to nothing, as no back averaged
three yards a carry. The block-
ing was’ not that sharp against
the behemoth Irish line, which
must have used their grammar
school weights for the program
‘listings.

Jack Wiley, line coach of the
Cats, said on Monday, “There was
one consolation in that Notre
Dame. game. Fred Cox put on the
greatest exhibition of kicking that
I have ever seen. People wonder
why he was so good on this one
day, well, his other leg was both-
ering him, and he hardly played
except for kicking, and he was
well rested. That means a lot!”

, Nothing To Say .

‘Rick Leeson, the fullback who
was demoted to the second—string
against the Irish, told the Curb-
stone Coaches,

Cal and maybe we’ll show people
that we can play football.”
Coach Carl .DePasqua said,
“We can’t expect to_ wingames.
if we continue to make as many
mistakes as we’ve been making.
We give the ball away too often,

CRASHING‘ LINE-UP. These
two. bruising fullbacks, John
Telesky, right, and Lou Slaby
are both seeing plenty of action
these days. Telesky, a one-time
fourth-stringer, started against
Notre Dame, and Slaby /has been
.one. of the most consistent
itacklers so far.’ »

and you can’t.do that against
the kind of teams that we play.?’_

Michelosen said John Kuprok,
right end, injured his ankle slight-—
’ 1y against Notre Dame, Tackle Ed.
Adamchik suffered a thigh injury,
and Center Chuck Ahlborn picked
up a charleyhorse. They should
all be ready by Saturday.

Coach Joe Kuharich‘ said that
“Pitt has a rough ball club. I don’t
know why they haven’t won more
often this year. Of course, some
of my own second-guessers among
the subway alumni are probably
asking the same thing about my
team." ‘

Apparently everyone thinks, Pitt
isn’t a really bad ball club. They
have put on some exciting foot-
ball shows this year, but they
haven’t won. And winning alone
will please the public and sell the
ducats.

Troians May Look

Enemy X—ray

d To UCLA

BOB SMIZIK
Sports Writer

Southern California football coach.John McKay will face
one of the biggest problems any coach has to face, when he
brings his charges to Pittsburgh for a game with the Panthers

on Saturday.

McKay will haveto make sure that the USC gridders
are not looking ahead for their big engagement with UCLA

the following week-end. The .Cats'%

poor record may give the Trojans
a case of overconﬁdence a nd
cause them to look forward to the ‘
big game with UCLA on which a
Rose Bowl trip will ride.

Southern Californi_a°s recent re- -
cord is another factor that could
lead to an. over-conﬁdent feelingi
concerning the encounter with
hapless Panthers. In their last
four outings the Trojans have de-
feated California, Illinois and
Stanford in addition to tying
Washington, a team that defeated
Pitt.

To those who like to judge the
outcoirnegof a game by compara-g
tive Scores‘ it must be pointed out‘

that "the games the two teams
played against Notre Dame at
least equate the Washington
scores. I
The Cats lost a close one to
Notre Dame, 26-20, while the

Sophomore Quarterback Pete
Beathard has captured the fan-

Last Saturday, against Stanford,

had the ball to spark his team to ‘

a 30-15 win.

One of the leading USC rush-
ers is fullback Hal Tobin, a con-,,
verted halfback, who has unu-
sually good speed for a; fullback.

Alan Shields, Ben Wilson, and
Willie Brown are a trio of hard
running backs that should give
the Panther line a lot of trouble.

The Trojan line is strong in the
same place the Panthers are. Cen-
ter Dave Morgan and Guard Mike
Rose were picked on Stanley
West team. These two stalwarts
are joined by nine other letter-
men on the line to give the Tro-
jans plenty of experience up
front.

Panther fans should be ‘hope-
ful that the Trojans see only vis-

may be the Cats‘ only hope.

F rash Led
By 3 State
Champions
Johnson, H all, Carr
Lead Mat Squad

Coach Rex Peery has re-
cruited a freshman wrestling
team that has a good chance
to go down as the ﬁnest frosh

"mat squad in Pitt’s history, as

is evidenced by three Penn-

sylvania High School Champions. \

Leading the array of title hold-
ers is Mike Johnson. The Lock
Haven High grad is one of the
few grapplers ever to capture the
state toga four years. In 86 scho-
lastic meetings he was never de-
feated. ,

John Carr and Lee Hall are the
team’s other two champions. Both
won their titles in 1960, with Carr
grabbing the 154 pound title,
while Hall triumphed in the 165
pound bracket. Peery has Carr

‘ tentatively slated to wrestle at 167

and Hall at 177 pounds.

Other members of the team that
ha-ve compiled impressive high
school records are Frank O’Korn,
Ken Warnick and Tom “Heniﬁ.
O'Korn was state runner-up at
138 pounds, while Heniff took a

third in the 123 pound division

of the Illinois State Champion-
ships and Warnick advanced to
the Pennsylvania District ﬁnals
before losing last season.

Other members of the squad are
Russ Vogel, Bill Brooks, Don
Caslow and John Irving.

At the present time the squad
does not have a grappler to per-
form in the 191 pound class of the
heavyweight division.

‘(ADE Man, 

 

Booters Prep for State‘-

The Panther soccerteam -is idle

this weekend, but will take ad-.

vantage of the extra time to pre-
pare for the season finale at Penn
State next Wednesday.

Even without the services of
some of their star players, the
JungleiCats have ‘been playing a
spirited brand of soccer. This was
clearly evident in last Saturday’s
5-3 victory over a strong Lock
Haven squad’. Ray Tarasi emerg-
ed from that encounter as a dan-
gerous scoring threat, tallying
four goals against Lock‘ Haven.

Pa.ul Liberti, who scored Pitt’s
other goal last" Saturday, also has
been playing exceptionally well
lately. Sam Donatelli and Jerry
Yospin should also draw some at-
tention from the Lions.

With the game still a week

 

away, there is a possibility that
some of the injured Pitt booters
will return to action against Penn

State. Although it is doubtful that

“Corky” Cuthbert and Hannington
Okoth will play, Alberto Sichel
should be ready to tangle with the
Lions.

For the most part, Penn State
has a very young team. Early
in the season they were beaten
badly, but since that time they
have gained something which is
important to every athletic team
—-experience.

only a one—man squad to IC4A‘
f2charnpionsh‘.ips this weekend
 New York. Steve Waslo,
the Cats’ ace rurmer.al1 year

  

5. 7will be the solo representa-
jtive.

 llowever', Rees will take at
"least a two-man freshman squad
{to the meet. D-on Bailey and Ralph
iBasinsl:i will try to pick up some
;—points for the frosh. It is hoped
that the lrosh will do better than
last year’s entry which was ex-
pected to be among the front-
irunners, "but. ﬁnished near the
‘bottorn.

_ ‘Bailey was quite impressive this
hast Saturday, as he ﬁnished sec-
ond in a Junior AAU encounter
at Schenley Park, a race which
involved the disi;ri.Ci:’s varsity har-
riers as well as the Panther Cubs.
‘His clocking of 23.23 was a better
ftime than anyl-‘itt varsity run-
iner has turned in this year, with

the exception of Waslo.

‘ A Bailey Good

“Bailey is as good as any 1':'re.sh—-
man we’ve ever had,” stated the
Panther mentor. “And Basinski.
who also looked well 010' Satur-
day, is also going to develop into
a really fine distance runner."

In last year’s IC4A encount-
er, the, Jungle Cats’ three thin-
olads performed poorly. Their
number-one man. Harry Stokes.
came home a disappointing 45th
‘in a. ﬁeld of 280. The 1960 frosh
squad also failed to live up to
expectations, after having an
outstanding season.

This year Penn State. Michigan
State, and Army rated as co~fa-
,vorites to cop the team title.
* .ale’s Bulldogs find themselves
a rlark—horse role.

Cornell Has Favorite

One of the top individual favor»
tee is Cornell’s Machooka, a soph-
omore from Kenya who ran away
from the frosh field in last year’s
freshmen contest. Other runners
who will be battling for top hon-
~'.1‘S include Michigan State’s Jerry
Toung, Penn State’s Gerry Nor-
man and Howie Deardorff, Mack
: if Yale, Notre Dame’s Carver,
‘ ind. NYU’s Jim Brown.

ﬂ=[§§§©[ll éfl ==Why men watch girls

Men watch girls for various reasons. Personally, we need
no better reason than the reason men climb mountains.
They are there. We have heard old men say they watch
girls because it makes them feel younger and young
men because it makes them feel older (see above). While
investigating the reasons why men watch girls we picked
up a clue from, of all things, a bird watcher. He told us
