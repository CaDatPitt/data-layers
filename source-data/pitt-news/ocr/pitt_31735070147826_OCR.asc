The ambient sounds of “Wake
Up” by indie-rock band Arcade
Fire permeate the rooms of Pitt’s
William Pitt Union. Circling
around into the International
Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame, a
room created to honor jazz mu-
sicians, Reggie Wilkins is seated
at a bench in front of a Yamaha
upright piano.

His hands gracefully glide
across the piano, his ﬁngers gen-
tly pressing down on the keys. He
doesn’t use sheet music when he
plays because he has learned to
listen to the sounds of songs and
replicatethem.

The 23-year-old senior major-
ing in architecture is widely known
on campus not only for his spikey
dreads, but also for his abilities
on the piano.

Wilkins, through his playing,
has found a niche for himself in
Pittsburgh. And although he says

Reggie Wilkins’ dreads and musical abilities garner popularity among students on Pitt’s campus.

has unintentionally shaped a mu-

“I deﬁnitely play for myself,
but I like when other people are.
enjoying the music that I play, so
it’s like we’re sharing the experi-

Last week, Wilkins gathered
a few of his friends to have a late
night “jam session” in the WPU.

The jam sessions are casual
events where Wilkins and his
friends get together to just enjoy
playing music. There is no struc-
ture because the goal is to make
music, said Wilkins, pushing a
Xylophone forward to encourage
me to play along with them, even
though I’m not familiar with the
instrument.

Students aided by. freecoffee at Hillman

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staff Writer

The smell of freshly brewed coffee
permeated the ground ﬂoor of the
Hillman Library last week..

So did the anxiety of about 25
students. Cheez-It boxes, loose
leaf paper and books were strewn
across wooden library tables, and
the night wore on. ..

This week, the Cup & Chaucer
on the ground ﬂoor of the Hillman
Library will serve free 8 oz. cof-
fees and teas to students as they
study or work on papers during
Finals Week.

The free coffee and tea is only
provided between 10 p.m. and 2

a.m., although the rest of the li- '

brary is still open for 24 hours.

At 9:59 p.m. on Wednesday
night, students slowly started lin-
ing up at the counter, eager to get
their energy boost.

Siobhan Marrero, a sophomore
majoring in marketing, had already
been at the Hillman for two hours,
but needed a coffee at 10 p.m. if
she planned to keep working on

night. Her paper wasn’t due until
the next week, but wanted to get
a head start on all of her work due
during Finals Week. '

Although she described herself

as a “coffee addict,”she planned on A
drinking tea after her ﬁrst and only '

coffee to avoid going overboard on
the caffeine.

Accordinglto the NSF, three 8
oz. cups of coffee per day" is con-

’ sidered a moderate amount of caf-

feine, and six or more 8 oz. cups

of coffee per day is considered an

excessive intake of caffeine. In
moderation, caffeine can make a
person more alert, but too much
can make the consumer irritable

Elise Gamertsfelder: j     .
I’m not going to complain,
about free coffee.

The 2011 Sleep in America Poll,

‘conducted by the National Sleep
Foundation — an organization A

that provides information to the

public about the importance of '

sleep — indicated that Ameri-
cans are coping with sleepiness
by taking regular naps and drink-
ing caffeine. The average person

drinks about three 12 oz. caffein-

ated beverages on a weekday, with

,The line at the Cup 8zChaucer
reached about 15 students at some
points Wednesday. The barrista
behind the counter ﬁlled up end-
less cups of small coffees, ready for
tired students to grab and go.

per bags and napkins ’— topplled

The counter beside the cups of
coffee held a‘ large, plastic jug of
honey and containers of assorted
creams. The sugar from the pack-
ets wassprinkled all across the
blacksurface.

Jason Bauman, the supervisor

. for the Campus Bean Scene, which

runs most of the coffee carts on
campus, saidthat the Cup 8: Chau-
cer has now been providing the
free coffee and tea during ﬁnals
week forthree years. The Cup &
Chaucer is the only campus coffee
cart that serves free coffee and tea
during the week before ﬁnals and
the actual Finals Week. ,

‘ Cup & Chaucergusually closes at
10 p.m. at the latest, but during the
last two weeks of the semester, it

— extends its hours until 2 a.m.

V , “We stay open and have the free

- coffee and tea so they can study,”

Bauman said. “It’s just so the stu—
dents can have what they need to
study.” '

Because caffeine is a stimu— ~

lant, most people reach for a cup
of warm coffee after waking up. In
this case, however, they do so at 10

, p.m. to remain alert.

_ Bauman said that the Cup _&

Chaucer is serving more than 250
oz. of coffee and tea each night dur-
ing its late—night hours.

Once caffeine enters the blood-
stream, it remains for-. several
hours. It can take about six hours
for one half of the caffeine to'be
eliminated, according to the NSF.

While it’s tempting to go back
to one’s room and sleep, some stu—
dents on Wednesday night were
determined to spend the next few
hours in the library to get their
work done. , , .

Elise Gamertsfelder, a freshman
nursing student, had been study-
ing anatomy and microbiology in
the library since 6 p.m.

She was one of the ﬁrst people
in line when the Cup 8: Chaucer
started providing the free coffee
and tea. She planned to drink just
one coffee for the night, just for a
caffeine boost. A

“I’m just getting sleepy,” she -

said.

Gamertsfelder said it’s prob-
ably not the best idea to encourage
students to stay up late in replace
of much—needed sleep, “but I’m
not going to complain about free
coffee.”s I ‘

Local breweries attract consumers withcraft beer T

.&pri1~‘2’ 5, “zloii If The Pitt News l vvww.pittnevvsl com

Pittsburgh craft brewers, a “tight- knit community, ” unite to brew new kinds of beers”.

Katie McLaughlin
Contributing Editor

In the United States, there are two
types of beer: the brands with Su-
per Bowl commercials, and every-
thing else.

That might be true on a national
level, but for students who grew up
in Pennsylvania, it might be hard
to imagine a world without local
beer. Pittsburghers are surrounded
by dozens of in-state craft brews,
or brews made by small—end beer
producers.

The offerings of the Triiegs and
Victory brewing companies as well
local breweries including East End
Brewing Company, Penn Brewery
and Church Brew Works, are just
a sample of the beer producers
Pittsburgh has to offer.

These Pittsburgh breweries
produce a wide variety of beers
— from hoppy India Pale Ales to
refreshing witbiers — that allows
consumers to support local busi-
nesses no matter what their taste

in malt beverage. ‘

Pittsburgh certainly brews a lot
of local beer, but where can stu-
dents ﬁnd it?

City brewpubs including Church

Brew Works, Penn Brewery, Rock-

Bottom and Hofbréiuhaus, which

serve local craft beers. Fat Head’s
Saloon in the South Side even’
serves other local microbrews in

‘ addition to its own.

Some craft brewers, including
East End and newer microbrew-
eries such as Beaver Brewing

package their beers with food, pro-
vide an excellent opportunity to
leave Oakland for a birthday, date
or dinner with parents. Each serves
in—house beers in a wide variety
of ﬂavors. '
Pittsburgh bars, including
South Side establishments Over
The Bar Bicycle Café and Carson
Street Deli as well as Greenﬁeld’s

Hough’s Bar & Restaurant, also

Company and Full Pi‘nt Brew-
ing Company also host growler
hours, when consumers can visit
the brewery tostock up on their
favorite beers. The growlers, half-
gallon glass jugs, are reused like
the kegs brewers send to bars and
are ﬁlled from the tap for custom-
ers while theywait. l

\

East End is owned and operated ,

by Scott Smith, with help from his

assistant_Brendan Benson. East

1 End has been providing the Pitts-

burgh community with a regular
supply of craft beer since January
2005. Smith, a CMU graduate and
former mechanical engineer for
a Fortune 500 company, said he
started the brewery because he is
“trying to bring things into the city
that it’s lacking.”‘ _
Smith wasn’t the first craft
brewer on the Pittsburgh scene,
but when he began brewing here,

, he did something different — he

didn’t open a brewpub, a different
take on craft beer in a city whose
established craft beers are served
with food. ,

Smith says that thecraft brew-
ers of Pittsburgh are a tight-knit

community who often work to-

gether.

He explained that both Rock
Bottom and East End are partner-
ing to brew two, winning beers
from Pittsburgh homebrewing
club the Three Rivers Alliance of
Serious Homebrewers’ 21st an-
nual homebrewing competition.
Rock Bottom ‘will sell East End’s

beer at the restaurant and East End
will sell Rock Bottom’s brew at its
growler hours.

“If you take all of the Ameri-
can [craft] breweries — around
1,600, 1,700 -— if you take all of
our volume production in the U.S.,
we make up less than 5 percent [of
total U.S. beer production]  That
little 5 percent, we deﬁnitelyhave
close relationships and help each
other along the way,” Smith said.
“Church Brew Works, we’ll borrow
ingredients from each other.”

Timothy Rus_sel_l, founder of
Craft Pittsburgh magazine, agrees.
He stated in an e—mail, “I know of a
few instances of the local breweries

. supporting each other that would

be surprising tomost. Some have
taken another’s beer, to a’, festival
and even poured it forattendees,
maybe because the other brewer
couldn’t make it. I know where
some have supplied grain or hops
to another on short notice because
the other brewer didn’t get their
shipment in time.”

Holes in Library System result inymissing books

Katie McLaughlin
Contributing Editor

An unknown number of Pitt’s
about 6 million library books are
missing. The University does not
know whether these books from
Hillman Library are in use some-
where in the building, shelved
incorrectly or stolen.

They fall through a hole in the
University Library System, which
provides patrons with the books
they need but doesn’t always allow
for the status of a missing book
to be updated. Without taking
an inventory of all the books —
which Hillman Library does not
do — the library system cannot
know how many of the Univer-
sity’s books are missing, only how
many are reported missing.

The University only lists books
as “missing” when library staff
cannot ﬁnd them for patrons and
then report them as not found.

Fern Brody, the associate Uni-
versity librarian who works un-
der Rush Miller, director of the
University Library System, said
that she did not have an estimate

of the number of books actually
missing from the library that are
unreported.

The University does not keep
a running tally of the books in
the Hillman Library’s collection,
either, Brody said.

“Yeah, I don’t know how many
books there are in Hillman,” she
said.

Brody mentioned that she
hopes to move away from pro-
viding tallies for the individual
libraries’ materials.

What happens when books
cannot be found

Sometimes a book listed as
“available” in the library’s elec-
tronic catalog system, PITTCat+,

_cannot be found. If patrons go

through the lending desk on the
ground floor of the Hillman Li-
brary, there is a protocol to make
sure the book is listed as “miss-
ing” in the library system.

The Lending desk sends a
“stack check” form to the employ-
ees in Room 306 of the Hillman
Library, who help patrons ﬁnd
books within the library. If the
student employees cannot ﬁnd
the book, it will be listed as “miss—

ing” in the library system.

Hillman Library student as-
sistant and Room 306 employee
Ed Butina explained the process.
“Lending is notiﬁed  and they’ll
give us these pieces of paper that
tell us to do stack checks. And _if
we can’t ﬁnd them, we’ll mark
‘not found,’ we’ll give them back
to lending on the ground floor,
and then that’s where they deem
it as missing.”

A hole in the system appears
when a student directly asks em-
ployees in Room 306 for assis-
tance ﬁnding a book. If a patron
receives help from a 306 student
employee and the employee can-
not ﬁnd the book, he or she then
assists the patron by ﬁnding the
book in one of the other Univer-
sity libraries or through an inter-
library loan using the “E-Z Bor-
row” system via the Pennsylvania

Academic Library Consortium

Inc. But Room 306 employees do
not ﬁll out the same forms as the
lending desk does — those that
would eventually mark books as
“missing” in the library system,
multiple Room 306 employees
said.

Brody said 306 employees
should fill out the same forms as
the lending desk.

“They should be doing that,
and it must have dropped off,”
Brody said. “That was a process
that they did before.”

Ann McLeod, head of Access
Services for the ULS, said that
employees from Room 306 some-
times notify the lending desk of
books that are not found during
stack checks. “Sometimes they

‘do, and those get referred so that

we can apply the missing status
to the item.” She stated that “it’s

practice that we, all of the library —

staff, should follow, whether ev-
eryone does or not.”

Why books go missing

The books could go missing
for a number of reasons, includ-
ing: a student actively reading
the book at the library; the book
being on a shelving cart or in a
book-return bin; thebook being
misshelved by a patron or staff, or

the book being hidden by a patron

who does not want to share.
“I do know people that can

hide books pretty well,” Hillman
Library student assistant Cody
Dickerson said. “Like, they have
a book that they need to read or
use for class that they don’t want
checked out.”

Sophomore student employee
Chris Yuhas says theft is also an
issue. “I’ve noticed as a patron
 where a student was leaving
the library and he beeped. But
I don’t remember exactly what
the lending person said, but they
beep sometimes because of their
own textbooks, but, I mean, we
don’t really have the right to say,
‘Let me check your bag,’ I mean,
I think we have the authority to,
but ...” ’

Alumnus and library employee
in the lending department Ben
Danforth agreed. “People do steal
books. We have sensors and that
kind of stuff, but they go off infre-
quently, or sort of sporadically,
and sometimes somebody else
has, like, a DVD or something that
sets it of .”

Brody said that there were
some problems in the current

Everyone does it. But doctors say you
shouldn’t.

The advent of Finals Week leaves students
more prone to all-nighters, but waiting until
the last moment isn’t just bad for the G.P.A. —-
it can be bad for the health.

Dr. Elizabeth Wettick, medical director of
the Student Health Service, offered health and
sleeping advice for students to get through the
last week of the semester.

-—Get six hours of sleep each night.

Wettick said in an e—mail that it is notagood
idea for students to stay up all night studying
because sleep deprivation can bring about
changes in cognitive functioning and make
tasks that require focus more challenging. It
can also negatively affect one’s immune func-
tion and increase vulnerability to infection.

—Eat small meals every few hours.

Every few hours, students should eat bal-
anced snacks or mini—meals instead of large
meals. In those small meals a person should
include carbohydrates, protein and fat such as
“yogurt with fruits and nuts, pita with re-fried
beans and salsa or half a peanut butter and
banana sandwich,” Wettick said.

“Avoid highly reﬁned carbohydrates like
sweets that can cause a strong rise/dip in blood
sugars, or too high in fat which may leave you
feeling sluggish,” she added. To quench their
thirst, students should ﬁrst stick to water, then
follow that with diluted juices and milk.

—Avoid consuming too much caffeine

Wettick said that “some caffeine is OK,”
but that it should be consumed early in the

..dax..s.9.Ihat.th:.lz9.d:Lha$ time to eliminate it

   

before resting.

According to the National Sleep Founda-
tion, six or more 8 oz. cups of coffee per day
is considered to be too much. Students should
also plan to have their last cup of coffee six
hours before they intend to go to sleep.

—Exercise

Wettick said that physical exercise is ben-
eﬁcial, and that students should try to work
out once a day.

“Do races through the hallway or count
how many jumping jacks you can do in two
minutes,” Wettick said. “The break lets your
brain rest, and the exercises help the brain
start studying more efficiently when the break
is over.”

Advice from students

—- Take breaks

Many Pitt students said they take small
breaks in between a few hours of studying.
Alexis Karkoska, a sophomore nursing major,
said she will try to go on a run during a study
break or watch one of her favorite shows on-
line. Karkoska said she would not be inclined
to pull an all-nighter.

“I’ve been up until 4 a.m., and it has been
to the point where after 3 am. there is almost
no more information you can put into your
brain,” Karkoska said.

— Eat cookies

Aaron Ketner, a sophomore architectural
studies major, said he just treats his ﬁnals like
any other exams, but a certain cookie has got
him through the week.

“Oreos,” Ketner said. “They’ve been pretty

protocol for handling alerts of the li-
brary’s sensors.

“They should be stopping people. Well,
the person at the desk should be stop-
ping,” Brody said. i V

“Now if the person runs out the door,
we have the building person, a building
supervisor. The person at the desk can
try to either get somebody that’s working
with them to go out and, of course, we try
to call somebody,” she said. “Frankly, if
somebody really wants to steal something,
they’re going to steal it.”

A Who keeps track of the books

Full—time library employees, including
those who are responsible for the Hillman
stacks, do not have permission to speak
to the press. V

When asked who is in charge of. ensur-
ing that library books listed as available
are actually there, Henry Goodelman,
graduate student and library student as-
sistant, responded, “That would probably

Brody explained that McLeod “is re‘-
sponsible for lending, interlibrary loan
and the media services area, as well as
the off—site storage,” and Paul Beck, the
Room 306 staff supervisor who reports to
McLeod, “is responsible for the Hillman
stacks, directly.”

But, Brody said, “I would guess I’m in
charge of the procedures.”

Ultimately, Brody says the ULS does
not have an estimate of how many books
are missing from Hillman Library, nor do
the staff members know how many books
are housed in the library.

Brody said, “We haven’t done an in-
ventory of Hillman Library. Some other
departmental libraries have done that
over different times. But at Hillman we
haven’t. So there’s not a check. We’re not
going to be saying, here was the count
at the beginning, here was the count at
the end.” ,

When asked why an inventory of Hill-

.’ man hadn’t been performed, Brody stated,

“The work. It’s really kind of a massive
project.” I

Wilkins taught himself howto play the piano

Pianist 4 2

ships between Reggie and his friends. Chri-
est and Koenig were playing in Schenley Pla-
za about a year ago when they met Wilkins.
Leavitt approached Wilkins while he was
playing his electric keyboard in Schenley
Plaza almost a year ago. Dulberg, Wilkins’
girlfriend, met the pianist several months
ago at a show at which’ he was perform-
ing. She went up to compliment him on
his playing.

The group has a symbiotic relationship,
and each person can tell what the other is

going to play. They speed up or slow down ‘

the tempo together. They increase the vol-
ume or play more softy together.

- Even though Wilkins will improvise what
he plays, Koenig said that he knows Wilkins’
style well enough that he usually knows
what he’ll play.

Wilkins starts with ambient music on the
piano, and everyone is relaxed. He said that
he tries to play certain piano keys consis-
tently so as not to throw anyone off.

“Whatever I feel, I play,” Wilkins said.
“I usually make up what I play, so I never
really know what I’m going to play. I usu-
ally know what sounds good, but I never
have speciﬁclkeys that I plan to play in a
speciﬁc order.”

Eventually, the tempo got faster, and the
volume got louder. Chriest started excit-
edly slapping an empty, plastic juice bottle
against a table. Everyone was looking at each
other, smiles on their faces, laughing.

Wilkins’ eyes were closed, he slowly '

swayed as his ﬁngers danced across the
keys. ' I ,
- “Sometimes people have mistaken me
for a blind person when I’m playing and
getting really into it,” Wilkins said.

The sounds drew attention from three

freshmen, who leaned in the door to watch .

the performance. V

Kristen Tigman said that she has seen
Wilkins play in the Union before, and she’s
watched him perform at local college par-
ties, which Wilkins plays at often. This was
the ﬁrst time that Tigman heard Wilkins
playing with a group of people.

“I think it’s a gift,” she said, referring
to the ability of the people to play so well
together. “They just let the music progress.
It doesn’t have to be structured.”

Wilkins has never had any formal piano
lessons. He took his ﬁrst class on the fun-
damentals of music this year. He said he’s
mostly using the class to learn how to read
sheet music and how to communicate with
other musicians using technical jargon.

Hetaught himself to play the piano when
he was a teenager growing up in Washing-
ton, D.C. His grandmother bought hisfamily

a little toy keyboard from Radioshack when-

he was 13 years old, and he was immediately
hooked. V V
“I just couldn’t leave it alone,’? Wilkins
said. “I kept playing on it.” e I I _
Wilkins comes from a family that has

often connected musically. His mother
and sister sing, mostly at their church in
Washington.

“There was a lot of singing, but not a lot
of instruments played in the house,” Wilkins
said. “I’m not the best singer, so it worked
out well that I could play for them.”

He ﬁrst played jazzy music. After he
started playing for his church, he “picked
up a more soulful style.”

When Wilkins came to Pitt, he was able
to play string pianos, which he said “didn’t
sound as artiﬁcial as the keyboard.”

He couldn’t stop playing the piano,
almost like he was addicted to creating
music. He plays anywhere from one hour
to six hours a day, depending on his class
schedule.

“It’s like, ‘Oh my God, I can’t walk past
the Union, or else I’m going to want to walk
in and play,”’ Wilkins said.

The music at black churches has re-
mained an inﬂuence that has weaved in
and out of the music he plays.

After moving to Pittsburgh, he found
another church to play at. Every Sunday

Craft beer market to expand

Beer < 6

If students don’t wish to leave Oakland
to get their local microbrew ﬁx, Mellinger’s
Beer Distributor on Semple Street stocks
a large selection of craft beers, including
brews from over a dozen Pennsylvania mi-
crobreweries, including ﬁve Pittsburgh—area
breweries.

. Ben Cataldi, a manager at Mellinger’s,
said although an older crowd generally pur-
chases the brews, students tend to splurge
on pricier beers after they come back from
breaks with extra cash. He added that the
seasonal and local beers get extra attention.
Additionally, variety packs from breweries
like Rivertowne, Church Brew Works, Full
Pint and Penn Brewery sell well because
“they are a good way to try everything,”
Cataldi said. -

Pitt’s Doggin’ It on Atwood Street also
carries a selection of local brews. Students
can also ﬁnd Pittsburgh craft beers, par—
ticularly those from East End Brewing, on
tap at Mad Mex on Atwood Street, where
drafts are sold for half-off Monday through
Friday during happy hour, from 4:30 p.m. to
6:30 p.m.]efl' Lucas, Mad Mex bar manager,
said that students drink a lot of craft beer,
particularly during happy hour. A

Craft beer is a burgeoning industry in
Pittsburgh and in the country.

“Beer as a whole has been ﬂat or down a

bit, but craft beer is up in the double digits,”
Smith said. “Our volume is up 30 to 40 per-
cent. It’s a sign of the overall picture.”

In fact, business has been going so well
for Smith that he is currently in negotiations
to purchase a new building for his brewery,
as the Susquehanna Street location is run-
ning at capacity. _

Russell predicts that the Pittsburgh craft
brew market will continue to expand.

“You’re going to see a lot of imitators in
the next few years,” he said. “I know of at
least three more breweries set to open this
year, and probably more to follow. There are
going to be some failures from this surge, but
I really think some great ones will emerge
from it.” ’

Smith hopes that his beers draw in stu-
dents, but says that his “zero—solid-waste
operation” recycling efforts and the “club
feel” of his brewery also draw in crowds.
However, he also attributes his success to
his local distribution.

“There’s a guy, an Englishman, who’s per-
ceived as the father of craft beer. He said
beer should not be drank any further from
its source than a horse can walk in a day,”
Smith said. “Buy fresh, buy local has been
a great movement for us. It’s almost like we
have an unfair advantage being local.” I

Mayday the earth stood still

The Associated Press reports
that an air traffic controller in

he was supposed to be monitoring
planes. This controller’s misstep
comes as the Federal Aviation
Administration has received ﬂack
for cases of ﬁve other controllers
falling asleep at the j ob. Although
this controller was not watching
“Snakes on a Plane,” reports say
the movie did star Samuel L.Jack-
son. Thus, accordingly, we’re sick
of these motherf**king controllers
not watching these motherf**king
planes.

The article states that a Philadel-
phia—based company, Prime—Tel
Communications, has gained
control of almost one-fourth of all
1-800 numbers, and judging from
AP’s research, it appears most of
those numbers reroute to phone
sex lines. For example, dialing
1-800-CHICAGO, which used to
function as a tourism hotline for

Pain and the profane

A study out of the United King-

you reduce pain. The researchers
had participants dip their hands in
cold water, and those who repeat-

ed a swear word -—— rather than a
non—swear word -—— withstood the
painful stimulus longer. Accord-
ingly, we couldn’t come up with a
joke for this one, so f**k it.

this one

According to the soon-to-be-

Beer: Makinghistory    

Historical ﬁgures owe their fates to the brew

Molly Green
Columnist

 

Like the great poet Ricky Martin,
alcohol is a prophet scorned in its
own time, and many of its contri-
butions to historical events have
been lost. As a champion of the op-
pressed, I’ve sought to recreate some
of these many accomplishments as
faithfully and ﬁctitiously as I could

. muster.

Thomas Jefferson &John Ad-
ams _——- friends, allies, friends
again _

It’s always a shame when politics
get in the way of friendships, and no
one knows this better than Thomas
Jefferson and John Adams. When
Jefferson and Adams ﬁrst meet
while working on the Declaration
of Independence, they both get huge
‘friend-crushes on each other, and
they often stroll about the streets

. of Philadelphia discussing political

philosophy and making fun of Alex-

ander Hamilton’s accent.

But Adams is a Federalist, and
Jefferson is an Anti—Federalist, and
like Romeo andJuliet, some things
justaren’t meant to be. Things get
especially bad whenJefl'erson — Ad-
ams’ former vice president/friend —
wins the 1800 election and deposes
Adams of his presidential roost.

Adams — who has the tempera-
ment of a spoiled 7-year-old boy—
publicly freaks out on Jefferson,
shouting, “You have put me out! You
have put me out!”Jefferson_tells Ad-

ams to “talk to the hand,” and then A
. things are bad for a long time.

One day, whenJefferson and Ad-
ams are both retired and no longer
slandering each other in the press,
they realize that it’s really silly for
them to still be ﬁghting. Adams is
stubborn and prouder than a pea-
cock strutting down Bourbonistreet

during Mardi Gras, so it’s Jefferson

A prostitution solution  

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Slavery was banned in this country nearly
150 years ago, although that doesn’t mean
it is gone. Sex traﬂicking and sexual servi-
tude in this country have caused women to
be snatched against their will, engaged in
sexual intercourse against their will and,

’ ‘most insidiously, breaking the law against

their will. '

This is disgusting and must bestopped.

To that end, City Councilman Doug
Shields proposed an ordinance that would
require licensing of massage parlors. The
hope is that through regulation of suspected
brothels, prostitution and human trafficking
might be curbed, ,

The aim of the legislation is noble, and
Shields is to be credited with bringing up an
important issue that is often ignored;

'I’m not sure his legislation will work,

though. '

In order to obtain an illegally trafficked p

person, you have to break all kinds of state

and federal laws. Why would a city regulation

deter somebody who was already hell-bent
on breaking extremely serious laws? Or pre-
vent him from keeping the massage parlor
perfectly aboveboard and legal, while slyly
moving sexual liaisons elsewhere? A

Putting this aside, what happens if this
ordinance succeeds ‘spectacularly and en-
tirely eliminates prostitution in massage
parlors? Will this necessarily mean an end to
prostitution andtraﬂicking in the city?

. No. A . '
Craigslist removed its Adult Services

section only for ABCto ﬁnd that advertise-

ments for adult services were popping up
elsewhere on the site. .

Trying to prevent prostitution by going
after its outlets is a game of Whack—A-Mole.
Prostitution might disappear from mas-
sage parlors only to ﬁnd a home somewhere
else. The desires for sex and money are old
enough and strong enough that a person
with enough lust will ﬁnd a person with
enough greed to provide a« prostitute, one
way or another. It is better that we know
where the problem is so that we can work
against it surreptitiously than do something
that will scatter the problem to various dark
corners which are unknown tous.

According to Shields, a major advan—
tage of the bill is that it is now possible for
regulators to enter a massage parlor and
snoop around without needing a warrant.
This should ring two alarm bells. The ﬁrst
alarm is that warrants exist for a reason. If

in some cases we will do criminal in‘vestiga- '

tion without resorting to warrants by a non-
police force, what’s to say that ability won’t
expand to other cases? The second bell is less
obvious. Let’s say massage—parlor regulators
catch an act of prostitution in progress. This
evidence might be ruled inadmissible in a
courtof law because it was found without a
warrant, which means the perp walks.

So, what can we do about the problem
of human trafficking? Legalize prostitu-
tion. With prostitution legal, women who
are engaged in it against their will could go
to the police. If they do this now,,they risk
arrest and legal complications, which can be
greatly exaggerated by a pimp? as a means I
of control over those who might be foreign
and have no legal counsel.

Green< 13
who suggests that they meet up at a pub for
a drink.

Jefferson is dressed in an ascot and an un-
dersized fedora, but damn if he isn’t looking
good. He sips a gin and tonic. Because he’s
Thomasjefferson, he can get away with drink-
ing a beverage usually reserved for the middle-
aged—woman demographic. It tastes like pine
trees; like the sweet, sweet memories of his
childhood in Virginia, spent discussing Pla-
tonic theory with his older sisters and generally
being a huge nerd.

Adams is a fat, round little butterball, and
all he drinks is red wine, so after about a half
an hour, he already has a purple mouth and
considerable trouble keeping his balance.

Things are a bit tense at ﬁrst. Adams makes
small talk about the weather, while Jefferson
awkwardly twirls the swizzle stick in his drink.
But three gin and tonics and a bottle of wine
later, things are going much better. Eventu-
ally the two start talking crap on Aaron Burr,
who — being traitorous and generally bat—sh*t
insane — is quite the easy target.

“You were a way better vice president,”
Adams slurs. V

“I’m so glad we’re friends again. You’re my
best friend forever!” Jefferson says (gin and
tonics are known to lead to exaggeration).

The two embrace under the healing power
of alcohol.

Seward’s Folly — a drunken night’s
mistake?

William Seward, secretary of state under
both presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew
Johnson, is what one might call abadass. A hero
to all gingers, Seward survived an assassina-
tion attempt and cholera. As you might expect,
Seward doesn’t take crap from anyone — not
from Democrats, not from Republicans and
certainly not from Russians.

Eduard de Stoeckl is the Russian minister
to the United States under Tsar Alexander 11.
He wants to sell Alaska. The Russians, who
are well trained in the art of tarot and crystal
ball reading and therefore well aware that the
icy tundra would one day spawn Sarah Palin,
are eager to get it off their hands. Also, they
need money.

Already rejected by Canada, de Stoeckl
knows the United States is his last chance,
so he does what all smart business men do:
He invites Seward over for a game of vodka
flip—cup.

As it turns out, Seward —— a proponent
of manifest destiny — already wants to buy
Alaska. He is abig fan of polar bears and gold.
So seeing the ﬂip—cup tournament as an op-
portunity to bargain the price down, Seward
gladly accepts.

The result is the longest, most epic one—vs.-
one ﬂip—cup game in the history of the world.
After more than 20 rounds of play, Seward
emerges victorious and de Stoeckl pukes in
his toilet.

As winner, Seward pays only $7.2 million
for Alaska -—— about 2 cents per acre — and de
Stoeckl has to wear awornan’s style hat for the
following week. For those interested, if Seward

had lost, he would have paid $7.25 million for
Alaska and gotten a tattoo of an adorable kitten
saying, “Meow! I love Russia.”

WilliamJennings Bryan and why he hates
Darwinism

Democratic politician and champion of
silver WilliamJennings Bryan is a prohibition-
ist. Most people think he hates booze because
he is a devout Protestant and thinks alcohol
is the devil’s juice. But that’s only part of the
reason. Mostly, Bryan hates booze because
he’s an emotional drunk.

And I mean emotional —— you can’t take this
guy anywhere. One awful day in 1908, Bryan
loses his third—straight presidential election
— and to William Howard Taft of all people.
Taft, the man known to eat an entire pound of
salted almonds in one sitting. Taft, the man
from Ohio, the worst state ever. Taft, the man
with the world’s stupidest mustache.

Well, poor Bryan is in such a state of dis-
belief and offense that he has his ﬁrst shot of
whiskey ever. And then, he knocks back four
more shots at the behest of lifelong “friend”

Mayor James “Cowboy Jim” Dahlman. Dahl— .

man is agnostic and a seriously bad inﬂuence
on our boy Bryan.

Before long, Bryan is sobbing hysterically
about the gold standard.

“Gold, gold, gold. Everyone is just obsessed
with gold. What about silver‘? Silver is just as
pretty as gold. Silver is just as smart as gold. But
no matter how hard Silver tries, it will always
be second—best.”

Aside from Bryan’s vengeance for gold,
most people also know he hates Darwinism. I
mean he hates it. If there’s one thing destroy-
ing America, it’s the theory of evolution. Of
course, one could argue this is because of his
religious beliefs, but actually Bryan hates Dar-
winism because he can’t reconcile the fact that
he’s of Scotch-Irish descent, which means he
should be able to drink whiskey with the best
of them. He should be the William Wallace
of whiskey. When it comes to survival of the
ﬁttest, the Scoth—Irish know how to drink.
And poor Bryan can only explain this genetic
oversight by proclaiming that God must have
created him this way for a reason.

When Bryan tries to argue this at an annual
meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, developmental biolo—
gist Edward Loranus Rice totally disses him
by telling him he doesn’t know a thing about
science and makes him look like a fool.

Utterly heartbroken, a single tear rolls
down Bryan’s face as he realizes he will never
win anything, and he curses whiskey and his
Scotch-Irishancestry for the rest of his life.

_ Let these tales be a lesson to you. Alcohol
has shaped this country like the Mighty Ohio
shaped Pittsburgh. So the next time you read
a history book or watch a special on the His-
tory Channel, remember that there are two
sides to every story: the truth, and the partially
blacked—out, sort—of truth remembered after
a night of heavy drinking.

Eat’n Park won’t be bad 

Mike Good
Columnist

Returning sophomores and incoming fresh-
men will experience a vastly different Pitt
from the Pitt I knew as an underclassman.
Soon, a new dormitory will tower above
Bouquet Gardens, a green space will oc-
cupy the site of the old Children’s Hospital,
the University will construct yet another
large dormitory at University Place and
a year-round, yet-to-be-named indoor/
outdoor restaurant, which broke ground
a little more than a month ago, will occupy
Schenley Plaza. ’
Although Schenley Plaza and Pitt oper-
ate independently, the space is undeniably
a centerpiece of our campus, surrounded as
it is by several university buildings, includ-
ing the library and the Cathedral. In 2008,
in fact, we students voted the Plaza as the
“Best Place to Hang Out” as part of The Pitt

p News’ yearly “Best Of” competition.

What can students expect from this
new restaurant? Perhaps more than an-
ticipated. .

When the news dropped that Eat’n Park
planned to build a restaurant on plaza space,
I, like many people, reacted violently, retch-

ing obscenities to the heavens. But even A

 

students who are on the fence about the in-
progress restaurant might come to embrace
it like greasy food during a hangover. The
more I read about this project, the more I
begin to like the idea of the place.

Eat’n Park Hospitality Group expects to
invest $2 million in the project, the Post-
Gazette reports. These are private taxpayer-
free dollars, and tenants will pay a fee for
using park land, which will help maintain
all Pittsburgh Parks. Although Eat’n Park-
owned, the restaurant will not be called
Eat’n Park: One year ago, the Post-Gazette
reported that paperwork ﬁled with the city
listed the restaurant’s name as “Currant.”
But this has not been conﬁrmed since.

The restaurant will have its own menu,
though much like Eat’-n Park, it will special-
ize in American cuisine. (Like many yinzer
children, I pray that smiley cookies make
the transition.) If this has yet to sweeten the
deal, the proposed establishment will also
apply for an alcohol permit, and plans to
include bar service along with dinner. Con-
sidering it is illegal to drink with an open
container anywhere in Allegheny, sipping
a margarita or lime-wedged Corona while
sunbathing is unfortunately not a likely
possibility. Whether it will be a 24-hour

Trafﬁcking. a human from overseas to
Pittsburgh is expensive. A lot of money has to
be spent on either evading or bribing law en-

do something like this if it is both diﬂicult

can then spend its time hammering away at

I will grant that there is very impassioned
debate as to whether legalization would solve
anything. It seems to me that a lot of the stud-
ies that suggest it doesn’t might suffer from a
detection bias: An increase in human traffick-
ing after legalization might just be picking
up on a level of human traﬁicking that was
always there, yet remained undetected until
legalization occurred and enabled us to see it.
Econometricians should study this heavily.
In the mean time, I will say that legalization
is not a cure-all and is no substitute for a

relentless assault by theFBI and others on; ‘

slave-traders. Yet it would make sense that
it is easier to detect and combat an evil in
something legal and in plain sight than to
destroy the same evil in something already
illegal and therefore hidden from view. V

rigorouslymaintained parks I.’ve everseen,
I can conﬁdently say that restaurants in _
parks are actually quite ‘smashing. Of

course, at the time I couldn’t afford to in-

ydulge in any of the food offered, but still,

the buildings there were often classically
beautiful or designed to integrate into the
landscape, justas this building is proposed

to do.

changes over coming years: a newfootball
coach, new dorms and an uncertain budget.
This restaurant, slatedjtoopen by the year’s
end, just ‘might belone of the good ones.

RESTAURANT REVIEW

Drew Singer
Columnist

Domino’s Pizza claims to be born again.
Domino’s Pizza — whose name tradi-

‘ tionally serves better as an oxymoron than

a viable dinner option, whose advertising

. campaign ﬂoods the airwaves so heavily
that it violates Libya’s no—fly zone, whose
pizza my grandmother once called “chazer
crap” — is telling us college students (see:
pizza experts) that it can now roll with
the Little Nippers and Papa Da Vincis of
our world. a

With ﬁnals week just beginning, pizza
places will likely see a rise in revenue, but
the question‘ is whether or not Domino’s
should be trusted to deliver.

The company’s current “Oh Yes We Did”
commercial campaign ﬂat-out admits to
the company’s having terrible pizza, but
promises that change has come at last.

“Most companies hide the criticism
that they’re getting,” a particularly cute
executive says during one ad. “We actually

' faced it head on.”

The commercial goes onto give a rare,
realistic glimpse into how the Domino’s
executives rolled up their collective Brooks
Brothers’ sleeves and did what they had
to do. This is no pieceof propaganda, but
rather a ﬁlm that includes nothing but
real footage of the Domino’s brass at its
Very finest. , c ‘ ‘ . -

Presented as a montage, the docu-
mentary first shows teary-e'yed execu-
tives listening to disgruntled customers.

. Then, excitedlexecutives stand in a circle

and clap. We later see executives tasting

sauce out of a ladle, andﬁnally, eating

pizza and trading high fives. So that’s how
they did it. , ‘ '

“We changed everything,” a nameless"

chef says to no one in particular.““The
crust, the sauce, the cheese. Now it tastes
better.” ~ A . '

“There comes a time when you know
you’ve got to make a change,” Domino’s
President Patrick Doyle says in thetad
— which later features still—head chef
Brandon Solano, who brags about being
in charge for the past 25 years as if he
didn’t know the commercial is about how

» bad his pizza’s been.

Call me cynical, but Domino’s and I
have been through a lot together. Our
relationship has been one of highs and
lows, surprises and disappointments,
breadsticks and wings. When I dumped
Domino’s a few years back, it was because

' I felt like I was the only one trying to make

the relationship work. It left a bitter taste
in my mouth, to say the least.

Domino’s says that its done a lot of
growing up, and deserves a second chance.
I never had the strength to delete that
phone number, so I called and asked for
a late—night visit.

The first shocker came before I had
even hung up the phone. Domino’s might
be the low—cost option in some communi-
ties, but this is Oakland, baby. Between the
tax, service fee, delivery charge and tip, I
had already surpassed the price of walk-
ing over to Antoon’s. The smallest, most
bare-bones pizza available from Domino’s
costs $10, and side dishes will set you back
another $6—1o dollars each.

But this experiment wasn’t about the
money. The real question is, “Has the pizza

really improved?” In short, the answer
is yes. The longer answer requires me to
explain what the pizza tastes like, so here
it goes: The pizza tastes likelpizza.

That might not seem like a big deal, but
to anyone who agrees with the customers
in the commercial, the “cardboard” taste
and texture that made Domino’s infamous
is now a thing of the past.

To be more specific, both the cheese
and sauce had distinct, enjoyable ﬂavors,
without being overwhelming. The crust

Singer tests out Domino’s Pizza’s claim of better pies

— a disposable part ofsome pies — went
down deliciously before I even realized I
had reached that stage of the slice. The
breading wasn’t thin-crust style, but also
wasn’t as thick as some of the local com—
petitors’.

That doesn’t mean the pizza’s going
to win any awards, but it’s good enough
that if it vibes with your particular taste
buds, it could become a regular in your

FOOD COLUMN

Pittsburgh in spring a
perfect place to picnic

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

The weather is ﬁnally decent (for Pitts-
burgh), ﬁnals are just days away from end-
ing and people are starting to move out for
the summer. It’s also picnic time.

You might think you have picnic pro-
tocol on lock, and I’m not saying that you
don’t. But still, let’s take a moment to re-
view the ﬁner points of outdoor dining
before embarking on this adventure.

As far as locales, your own backyard
offers the convenience of running back
into the kitchen for whatever you’ve for-
gotten to pack, but a more distant park or
meadow is undoubtably more scenic and
novel. Pittsburgh is riddled with scenic

green spaces you probably haven’t had the
chance to appreciate; take the opportunity
to seek out a new one now.

A red—and—white checkered tablecloth,
while a nice touch, is hardly requisite, but
bringing something to sit on in the very

likely event that the ground will be dirty is .

probably wise. Other than that, friends and
food are the only absolute requirements.
The friends you’re on your own for, hope-
fully I can help you with the cuisine.
Sandwiches might seem ideally suited
for the occasion on the grounds of con-
venience, but beware that they might go
rnushy before you get a chance to enjoy
them —.—r consider how long it will take to
trek to your location. Pro tip foripeanut

With three Grammy Awards under her-belt,
American jazz vocalist Karrin Allyson has
some high expectations to meet with her
upcoming album ’Round Midnight. , V
And she will~._n1eet those expectations.
Allyson’s style isifull of charm for jazz 16v’-

. ers, Her vocal  is impressive:-She can .
switch between -sounding soft and heartfelt:
to sounding low a‘I_i’dfeven scratchy, bringing ‘

in a wide range ofertiotional depth ti‘ rough

her voice alone.'}  

The lyricsadd to;tli,e depth and .variation
of her songs, wi.th."s"o,me offering insight
into heartfelt moments and othersinvok-
ing bittersweet or even angry memories
of love gone wrong.—The words themselves
are beautiful, like in -“rm Always Chasing
Rainbows,” _where Allyson sings, “I’_m-al-

ways chasing rainbows / waiting to find a A

little bluebirdin Slain.” .

Every track isstrong but quiet in its
musical delivery. Take “Goodbye,” a bal-
lad about lovers parting ways, in which
Allyson softly sings, “So you take the high
road and I’ll take the low / it’s time that we
parted, it’s much better so / so kiss me as
you go / goodbye.” Here the music draws
listeners in, ambling along with a slow pi-
ano, guitar and assortment of percussion
instruments. .

The percussion adds a layer to the mix
and serves as a pleasant addition in the lulls
between lyrics. In the end, however, the
piano and vocals are this album’s strongest
points musically.

Allyson’s songs are all wel1—thought-
out, smoothly composed and haunting,
resonating even after they end. Jazz lov-
ers will be pleased, and the genre might
even gain a few new fans with the release
of this album. I

When the Beastie Boys’ MCA (born Adam
Yauch) announced that he had cancer
back in 2009, I and many other fans
seriously worried that the pioneering
hip—hop trio had seen its last days. Now,
with MCNS hopeful medical prognosis
and a series of singles from the group to
back it up, the Beastie Boys might be on
the verge of another revolution.

Along with Mike D (Michael Diamond)
and Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz), MCA has
released a new video that serves to re-
mind the world that the Beastie Boys
are three of the greatest entertainers
to carry the hip—hop banner.

Officially a video for the single “Make
Some Noise” and also a trailer for a

22-minute short ﬁlm entitled “Fight for

an impressive expression of the trio’s
attitude.

Featuring actors Seth Rogen, Danny

Boys, the three raise hell throughout
New York to the annoyance of everyone
from Ted Danson to Kirsten Dunst and
Orlando Bloom.

While miming the real Beastie Boys’
lyrics to the camera, Rogen, Wood and
McBride go beyond the attitude of those
early videos to harness the power of the
group as a whole while maintaining their
own unique charms. I

Celebrities should stay
away from cartoon voices

Natalie Bell
At-}E Editor

The stutter of Porky Pig, the infectious laugh
of Bugs Bunny, the French ﬂirtations of Pepé
Le Pew —— they’re all classic cartoon sounds
and they all have one thing in common —- Mel
Blanc, the artist who voiced them.

But when these “Looney Tunes” classics
are mentioned, it is their animated appear-
ance and not the smiling face of the voice
artist that comes to mind. Their voice cre-
ator, like so many others in the ﬁeld, is not
a famous face.

But this is changing. The powerful vocal
chords of talents like Mel Blanc appear to be
cast by the wayside in a new trend: casting
celebrities as cartoon characters. Perhaps it
boosts box office marketability, but it detracts
from the ‘art form.

Take “The Lion King” for example: The

' ﬁlm boasted Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

Whoopi Goldberg and, of course, the grav-
elly, soothing bass of James Earl Jones. But
the problem is, it’s impossible to forget their
faces even when Goldberg’s vocals whine
from the mouth of a hungry hyena —“— though

     

www.pizzasola.Com

maybe that isn’t enough of a stretch.

Making famous actors into cartoons be-
came en vogue in the ’90s. Before that, the
top—grossing animated ﬁlms almost always
used casts of unknowns. It’s very obvious
when checking out CNBC’s list of top—gross-
ing ﬁlms of all time that those before 1990
hardly used celebrities, while every ﬁlm after
1990 had at least three notables.

Animated features used to provide an op-
portunity to create outside the realm of the
fanciful. Characters were goofy and their
voices were ridiculous to match — they
seemed to take on lives of their own.

Now, these creatures are caricatures of
the celebrities playing them. P0 of “Kung
Fu Panda” wasn’t just a lovable lummox, he
was Jack Black, the goofy, comic oaf, and
DreamWorks made sure everyone knew —
even spanning his name across the top of the
movie poster.

The same goes for the titular character of
Paramount’s “Rango,” who the studio touted
— just a bit too loudly — as being played by
Johnny Depp.

In fact, Depp’s own career speaks to ex-

Event supports going green

Art All Night 4 13

upon its website. He decided to attend
that night, and his jewelry was displayed
next to a sculpture on a table full of many
other pieces.

“For the city of Pittsburgh, I was very
impressed by number, range and caliber
of the art. You could see that there were
beginners —— there was an entire section
of children’s art. There were profession-
als, and all side by side. It was great to
see different media mixed all together,”
DeAndrea said. ’ A

Anyone and everyone is encouraged
to submit one piece of artwork for free to
facilitate a range of experience levels and
mediums. Though a child might showcase
a piece of art just for kicks, others use
the opportunity to improve their career
prospects..

“I hope to gain some new friends and
possible clients for commissioned art,”
Brittany Paige said in an e-mail.

Paige is a student at Carlow University
who entered a piece in the show last year
after being encouraged by the art instruc-
tor she has had since age 16. Paige said she
found that the gallery setup presented the
artwork well. ,

about 300-400 volunteers, spokeswoman
Tiffany Wilhelm said. She added that most
people hear about the event by word of
mouth and the event organizers do not
pay for advertising.

This year, there is a push to suppoé’
the environment by lessening the event’s
‘waste. People are encouraged to walk,
bike or use public transportation to get
there. The website provides information
about buses as well as a link to Bike Pitts-
burgh, which is loaning free bikes for the
event.

“It is so important for every event to be
green. Art and the environment go well to-
gether, but events often generate so much
trash. So we want to promote being green
as much as we can,” Wilhelm said. V _

While the night is focused on the dis-
plays of artwork, entertainment and food
are necessary to sustain guests throughout
the night. This year, bands will perform,
and video art by participating artists will
be displayed. _ .

“I noticed that some people who at-
tended the event were there were some
for serious art, but there were a lot of
people who wanted a cheap night out,”
DeAndrea*said. “There was music, food
and a ton of people.” __

butter and jelly: Spread a thin layer of
peanut butter on both slices of the bread
before adding the jelly. This will prevent
the jelly from oozing through the bread. If
sandwiches bore you, you might consider

branching out into that sister ﬁeld of pic— /

nicking, barbecuing.

I take no issue with blurring the lines
between picnic and barbecue if thelogistics
of grilling pan out for you. But please —— and
I cannot emphasize this enough — please
check if openﬁres are permitted on what.-
ever premises on which you’re picnicking.
Being kicked out of and/or burning down
your favorite park is no way to celebrate
summer.

You’re probably well-acquainted with
barbecuing burgers and hot dogs, but if
those tailgate staples bore you, consider
branching out to chicken or ribs, or even
steak or salmon if you’re going for a more
upscale vibe. Kabobs are another fun and
easy option and a good way of incorporat-
ing fruits and vegetables, not to mention
the ease of eating off a skewer.

Make sure whatever you’re cooking isn’t

too thick or the exterior will burn before the
inside is done, transforming your wou1d—be
tasty meal intoa half—raw charcoaled mess.
Grilling can be a healthier way of cooking
since much of the fat will drip into the ﬁre,
but be careful of possible ﬂare-ups. And
should there be cooking ﬂaws, judicious
amounts of ketchup, mustard and/or cheese
can usually rectify them. '

Bottlesof water or soda are obviously
ﬁne, but for the full ripping- off-that—heart—

wrenching-scene—from—“Up” effect, bring

along acanteen of lemonade.

Minimizing necessary utensils is deﬁ-
nitely desirable; the less you have to drag
around in your wicker basket the better.
Thus you’ll want to err on the side of des-
serts and side dishes that don’t require
plates and knives, such as chips and pretzels
or cookies and brownies.

Hopefully you’ve enjoyed your culinary
outing into the great outdoors, but please
make sure you leave it nice for others to
enjoy: Take home everything you brought
with you,and recycle when applicable. I

Movie lists not worth it

Farewell 4 23

Music, as well, has as much of a presence
in my life as literature and ﬁlm. In fact, I don’t
think I could have endured college without
a few impeccable musicians and lyricists to
score my exploits: Paul Simon, The Clash,
Kanye West, The Pogues, The Flaming Lips,
The Fugees, My Morningjacket, Radiohead,
Okkervil River and, perhaps most importantly,
The Notorious B.I.G., whom I always listen to
when I shave. .

Last but not least, there are innumerable
movies that, for whatever reason, never found
their way into my columns, but which none-
theless merit mention: Spike Lee’s “Do the
Right Thing,” Alfonso Cuar6n’s “Children of
Men,” Akira Kurosawa’s “Throne of Blood,”
Chris Marker’s “Sans Soleil” Paul Schrader’s
“Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters” and Kar
Wai Wong’s “Fallen Angels,” which has a
soundtrack to rival that of “Pulp Fiction.”

- I could go on for pages, but this sort of ‘

indulgence is, I imagine, more entertaining
for the writer than the "reader. In any case,
everyone has their own list of essential books,
music and ﬁlms, and will take or leave my
suggestions at their discretion. .

Which reminds me of another thing: movie .

lists are stupid. Readers enjoy them, we’re
told, but they can be singularly tedious to
manufacture. General categories —- “thebest

ﬁlms of all time;” “the best soundtracks of
time” — must be avoided at all costs, while
speciﬁcs —- the best French New Wave ﬁlms
of the 1960s —- might seem, to readers, little
more thanself-congratulatory exercises in
erudition.

More importantly, lists do little more than
reveal one person’s tastes. The act of ranking
one ﬁlm above another, even within highly
specialized conﬁnes, is fundamentally falla-
cious. Everyone will acknowledge that “There
Will Be Blood” is a better movie than “Beverly
Hills Chihuahua,” perhaps, but when compar-
ing two similarly lauded works — “There
Will Be Blood” and “8 1/2,” to summon a ran-
dom example — objectivity breaks down and
people fragment into different camps.

Discounting inane lists, however, perhaps
there’s an upside to this subjectivity: The sheer

impossibility of getting things right ensures '

criticism that will remain vital. Science, at

- least, has some measure of conclusiveness

— we’re sure, for instance, that the sun does
not revolve around the Earth, as we once be-
lieved, and thus geocentrism is all but extinct.
Conversely, we’re not sure what theending of
Abbas Kiarostami’s “Taste of Cherry” is sup-
posed to signify. Criticism is an unwinnable

rock samples on ‘fRhymin’ & Stealin”’
from License to Ill — but despite their

Quality worth more than revenue

Voice acting 4 25

' actly why the trend of fame-pandering is

bad for the animated art. The same way the
actor never looks the same twice — Edward
Scissorhands,Jack Sparrow, etc. — a voice
actor’s sound is constantly changing. For
both, crafting a well—rounded character is
more important than recognition. Animated
ﬁlms would do well to follow suit, creating a
fantastical world with rounded characters,
not productions that are ﬂat and riddled with
celebrities.

Though TV also utilizes celebrity voices,
the phenomenon is different in this arena.
Shows like “The Simpsons” and “Family Guy”
have regular casts and whether they’re ce-
lebrities or not,pthe nature of consistency
allows them to create identities. When they
do utilize famous people, those people usually
play themselves in cartoon form. Take for
instance, Seth Green or Mila Kunis’ roles in
“Family Guy” —— they’ve been doing it long
enough that they’re easy to forget.

And for every loss of a carefully formed

Many of the famous “Looney Tunes”

character to celebrity, a voice artist loses an
opportunity for work. Somewhere out there is
a lost, normal—looking person with an intense
set of vocals chords.

Veteran voice artist Billy West —A of
“Futurama” and “Ren & Stimpy” — spoke
candidly to the Guardian about his distaste
.for using stars instead of unknown voice ac-
tors. —
“The bottom line is, I only care about it
because I don’t want to see the loss of a beauti-
ful form of art,” he said, going on to talk about
how kids going into the ﬁeld aren’t generally
hungry for fame, but want to do the work.

And that’s the biggest reason why anima-
tion creators should think twice about casting
known faces. Celebrities might bring along
a big following, but those dedicated to voice
acting can make cinematic magic happen with
a tweak of their pitch or a hysterical laugh.

Pirates losing ways could soon come to an end 

Gwenn Barney
Senior Stajf Writer

If it takes a winning team to get fans into
seats, even the casual Piratesfanmight won-
der:]ust how close are the Pittsburgh Pirates
to breaking the .500 mark again?

The answer depends on whom you ask,
but for the most part the returns are posi-
tive.

“The difference between before the cur-

. rent management team arrived and today

is night and day,” said Matt Bandi, a Pitt
alumnus and author of “Pirates Prospects
2011 Prospect Guide,” a book that features
player proﬁles, analysis, predictions and
historical essays. 4

Bandi places himself in the faction of
fans who believe the team is ﬁnally headed
in the right direction.

He predicts that because of stronger -

player development and increased spending
to acquire players in the amateur draft and
international market, the teamcould break
its streak of 18 consecutive seasons with a
losing record by the 2012 or 2013Vseason. He
even says the team might be able to reach
the playoffs again by 2014 or 2015.

- Rob Ruck, professor of sports history and
recent author of the baseball-centric book

“Raceba1l,” maintains a more tempered'opti— '

mism when discussing the Pirates’ future.

“It’s hard to tell,” he said, “The team is
operating with a very constrained budget
in the league. They havej a long history of
making decisions based on bottom—line
-consideration's.”~ 7 S ,5 . =1; -5 '2 5 V

Ruck added that he’s encouraged by the
fact that management has invested more
in South America as of late. Ruck recently
visited the team-’s_ baseball academy in the
Dominican Republic, and said the facility
is top-notch. .. v _  ..

Unlike Bandi, Pirates President Frank
Coonelly isn’t ready to commit himself to a
timeline for victory. 1 .

“I’m not big on timelines because my
timeline is to win as quickly as possible,”
he said.

Coonelly believes that all the pieces are
nearly in place for the Pirates to make a
run for baseball glory once again. Since his
arrival in Pittsburgh three years ago, the
team has acquired a core of four players
with tremendous potential: Jose Tabata,
Neil Walker, Andrew Mccutchen and Pedro
Alvarez.

Many fans are hopeful that this core of
four can bring the offensive ﬁrepower to
overcome the 18-year hump, but -- and
this is a big but — it will only matter if bet-.
ter pitchers reach the majors before the

A top hitters’ contracts are expired and they

decide to leave the Pirates between 2015
and 2016.

The Pirates recently signed a number of
strong pitching prospects, including drafted
players Jameson Taillon and Stetson Al-
lie. They also dished out $2.6 million for
16-year-old Mexican pitching sensation
Luis Heredia. But the youth of these play-

ers prompts concern that they won’t reach
the majors in time to play alongside the core
of four as it takes even the best prospects at
least a couple years to progress through the
minor league ranks.

Coonelly said that this scenario should
not be cause for concern, as the Pirates have
perfectly good pitchers in the majors and

plenty of talent at the top of the minors. He
cited Brad Lincoln, Bryan Morris and Rudy
Owens, among other pitchers in the minors,» -
as examples. He also explained that there
is no way to be certain that the members of
the core of four will leave Pittsburgh when

iDeCicco hoping to appear in upcoming NFL Draft

Former Pitt safety ‘has proven versatility, athleticism, prompting NFL teams to take notice

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt senior Dom DeCicco isn’t a

wrshowman, and his personality

and style of play lack the ﬂair that
some other safeties and lineback-
ers entering the 2011 NFL Draft

’ have. But that’s the only weakness

that his agent, Drew Smith, sees
in his game.

“He’s very good in every as-
pect of the game,” Smith said.
“There’s not one thing that you
can really put your ﬁnger on and
say, ‘That’s what he is so much
better than everybody else in.’ But

‘§he’s above average in every single

category.”

A versatile athlete, _DeCicco
proved to be a valuable member
as a three year starter of Pitt’s de-
fense. and he hopes that his wide
array of skills merits him as a late
round draft pick.

DeCicco started in 12 games
for the Panthers this season. He
began the year at strong safety
but switched to linebacker when

DeCicco thrived under the change,

Duquesne transfers aid Pitt

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ” Writer

When Duquesne University recruited Rick
Devereaux andAnthony DeFabio to play
baseball, the two athletes never expected
the program to disappear before their ju-
nior season.

But when Duquesne decided to cut its
baseball program in January 2010, that’s
exactly what happened. Left without a team
to play for, the two considered their options
and eventually found a new home a little
more than two miles down Fifth Avenue
at Pitt.

“I think it has been an unbelievable tran-
sition,” Devereaux said. “The [Pitt baseball]
team was willing to accept me from day one
making it a very easy transfer for me.”

DeFabio-a third-baseman-said the de-
cision to transfer to Pitt after Duquesne’s
program folded was simple.

“[The coaching staff] was very helpful
and understanding of our situation and was
able to offer both of us opportunities to play
here,” DeFabio said. “Pitt is obviously a great
academic school, and the baseball program
is very strong.”

When the news of the program shutting
down spread, Pitt head coach Joe Jordano
jumped at the chance to pick up two talented
players.

“Both Coachjordano and Coach [Danny]
Lopaze did a great job of making me feel
welcome and comfortable in the recruiting

process,” Devereaux said in an interview.

Duquesne eliminated the baseball pro-
gram along with golf, wrestling and men’s
swimming in order to transfer more than $1
million annually into the school’s 16 other
athletic programs.

“Our reaction was pretty much shock as
one would expect,” DeFabio said. “We truly
did not expect it or see it coming. It deﬁnitely
brought us closer together, thoug .”

- The cuts affected about 70 of the near-
500 student—athletes at Duquesne. Thirty-
one came from the now-defunct baseball
roster. Additionally, four full—time coaches
and one assistant coach lost their jobs, in-
cluding baseball coach Mike Wilson. Ath-
letes whose programs were cut could keep
their scholarship until their NCAA eligibility
expired. .

“[The cut] was obviously very upset-
ting at the time,” Devereaux said. “I knew
it would make the ﬁnal season at Duquesne
very tough, but also very hard to see team-

_ mates and friends split apart in different

directions.” .

Devereaux is ctijrently a junior catche
and ﬁrst basemarffor the Panthers. He’s
started 16 games and found success at the
plate with a .306 batting average. DeFabio
proves solid as defense at third base and
catcher and contributes offensively with a
batting average of .284.

Devereaux and DeFabio rank seventh
and eighth on the team in batting average,
respectively, and have helped the Panthers

TONY’S_ TOP 10

 

Looking back at four years of Pitt sports memories

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staff Writer

Insert sappy introduction here.

I’m a senior, and I’m graduat-
ing, so here’s my sentimental ﬁnal
column.

For my last Top 10, I give you the
top 10 memories I have from my
four years at Pitt.

10. Pitt winning the Big East
regular season championship. Pitt
defeating Villanova at the Petersen
Events Center this year to clinch the
Big East regular season champion-
ship was one of the most emotional
games for me. We all know that
the regular season championship
doesn’t really mean that much -

‘ especially when the team loses early

in both ensuing tournaments — but
it was the last—ever game at the Pete
for senior players and students like
myself. The Panthers couldn’t have
scripted a better ending to the se-
niors’ careers at the Pete.

9. Meeting coach Michael -

Haywood. Bear with me here. A
week after Pitt hired Michael Hay-
wood as the head football coach,
he came to Pitt’s basketball game

   

against Maryland Eastern Shore.
Haywood entered the media room
and introduced himself individu-
ally to every single person in the
room. Iwas impressed, and I even
wrote in my live blog that he was a
“classy guy.” Well, shortly after, he
was arrested for a felony offense for
domestic violence. I’ll never forget
how Haywood made afool of me —
and Pitt administrators.

8. Levance Fields’ clutch
3-pointers. For the ﬁrst two years
of my Pitt career, I witnessed some
incredible ﬁnishes by the Panthers.
Many of them were thanks to Le-
vance Fields. In 2007, he hit a step-
back 3-pointer to beat Duke at Madi-
son Square Garden. The next year,
he hit a similar shot to propel Pitt
past Xavier and into the Elite Eight
for the ﬁrst time in school history.

7. Steelers winning the Super

' Bowl. OK, this doesn’t really have

anything to do with Pitt sports, but
it affected everyone in Oakland. The
Super Bowl riots of 2009 were noth-

ing shortof epic. It got a little out of ’

hand with the damage of property,

butlfeelbadforpeoplewho’venever *

had the opportunity to experience
the pure joy of thousands and thou-

tease a

amryte

:5
«'5

sands of people celebrating a win
like that.

6. Pitt beatingWVU. For most of
my freshman year, the Pitt football
team was abysmal. Pitt was 4-7 head-
ing into the Backyard Brawl against
No. 2 West Virginia. IfWVU beat Pitt,
it was headed to the BCS National

Championship game. And oh yeah, i

it was the 100th meeting between
the bitter rivals. Yet, somehow, some
way, Pitt managed to win the game.
Even though Pitt ﬁnished the season
5-7, it sure felt good to ruin the hopes
and dreams of our rival. The post-
game riots were pretty fun, too.

5. The Pitt-Butler game. I’m
sure you just cringed a bit remem-
bering this game. But1et’s face it,
the Pitt-Butler game this March

was one of the most bizarre/best »

games in NCAA Tournament his-

— tory. Only the “Chris Webber Tim-

eout Game” featured a more bizarre
ﬁnish. Pitt got the short end of the
stick (again), but I can always say I
was in attendance fora game where
there was a shot-clock violation, a
go—ahead jumper, an inexplicable
foul, a missed free throw, an even
more inexplicable foul and a game-
winning free throw all in the ﬁnal

10 seconds of the game.

4. Pitt winning four games in
four days. This memory is a little
happier. Pitt’s basketball team strug-
gled through the regular season in
2007-08 after Levance Fields broke
his foot. But he came back in time for
March, and the Panthers went on a
tear to win four games in four days
and win the Big East tournament.
It’s always nice to see the Victory
Lights shining in March.

3. Pitt’s crushing defeats. These
might be the most scarring memo-
ries, but it deﬁnes us Pitt fans. We’re
the Chicago Cubs fans of the NCAA.
Pitt tends to get fans’ hopes up. And

when it looks like they’re down for"

the count, the Panthers somehow
ﬁnd a way, to come back —— only to
ﬁnd new ways to lose at the ﬁnal
horn. My fondest crushing defeats
will always be falling to Villanova in
the Elite Eight, losing to Connecti-
cut at the buzzer at Madison Square
Garden, losing to Cincinnati by one
point in football and, of course, the
Butler game. OK, that’s enough de-
pression for this list 

2. Ronald Ramon’s buzzer-

beater. My ﬁrst Backyard Brawl ex-
periencecame in February of 2008.

I had waited in line for several hours
to get good seats in the Oakland Zoo,
but it looked like West «Virginia was
going to upset the Panthers at the
Pete. But WVU kept missing free
throws, and Pitt kept chipping
away in the ﬁnal minute. It all cul-
minated with Ronald Ramon nailing
a 3-pointer at the buzzer to win the
game. Whenever I’m feeling blue, I
watch the You’I‘ube video, and I’m
immediately happy when I see the
crowd simply explode.

1. My ﬁrst day in the Oak-
land Zoo. In high school, I always
watched Pitt games on TV and saw
how much ﬁm the student section
had. When I decided to come to Pitt,
I knew that I would be at as many
games as possible. So when the ﬁrst
preseason game rolled around in
2007, I didn’t quite know what to
expect. Itwas actually Halloween, so
there were a lot of characters in the
Zoo. It was one of the most exciting
days of my Pitt fandom, knowing
that I was ﬁnally in the Zoo. _

Little did I know that it would
all end with me sitting in the media
rows when Pitt held_up the Big East
Championship trophy four year
later. I . -

Harper, Yoklic prepared to step into starting roles

Isaac Saul
Staff Writer

When Pitt named Todd Graham
the head football coach in Janu-
ary, Graham announced that his
system wasn’t just a no—huddle
offense, but a no—huddle football
team.

That meant that all the ath-
letes would be affected by Gra-
ham’s intense, up—tempo philoso-
phy, including, as Matt Yoklic and
Kevin Harper quickly learned,‘
the punter and the kicker.

“In the weight room, we do the
same exact thing as everyone else
now,” Yoklic said. “Last year, we
had the specialist regimen.” ,

La-st season, Dan Hutchins
handled both the kicking and
punting duties for the Panthers.
So when he graduated, two start-
ing positions opened. Redshirt
freshman Yoklic assumed punt-
ing duties, and Harper, a red-
shirt sophomore, took over as
kicker.

As Harper and Yoklic have
attempted to adjust to their

new starting positions, they’ve
also had to adapt to Graham’s
coaching style — which Harper
describes as more intense than
former head coach Dave Wannst-
edt’ .

Matt Yoklic:

said.

Graham said he likes that the
kickers are competitive and that
he wants them to train like any
other members of the team.

“They go through our tackling

defense off—guard.”

Harper is already feeling the
wear and tear on his legs.

“The biggest challenge is
keeping my legs fresh to kick
because we’re always running,

in the Weight  We do the same
    

      

“We have to do tackling drills
now; we’re treated like real play-
ers and not just specialists,”
Harper said. i

Yoklic said he appreciates '

Graham’s fresh energy.

“It’s been different, butil def-
initely like the change,” Yoklic
said. ’ ,

Harper agreed. .

“What we’re doing is making
us stronger, better teammates
and better overall athletes,” he

drills every day,” he said. “They
appreciate that they’re included.
They’re not just some guys who
go and kick.” . A
For both Yoklic and Harper,

the biggest repercussion ofthe’

new system seems to be the add-
ed emphasis on running.

“One of the big things is run-
ning on and off the ﬁeld,” Yoklic
said. “He has made a point to
[make us] run on and off the ﬁeld

at full speed to try and catch the

 

 

lifting and kicking hard,” Harper
said. “But it’ll be good in the long

« run because they’ll befresh every

Saturday.”

‘And during Saturdays this
year, Harper and Yoklic will have
to adjust to being Pitt’s go-to
kicker and punter, respectively.

Yoklic, a local product who
graduated from Pine-Richland
High, was an All—Quad North
punter when he played for the
Rams. He averaged 39.45 yards

per punt as a senior. He walked ‘ll’

onto Pitt as a freshman and was
redshirted, and last year, he
backed up Hutchins at punter.
Harper, rated the No. 5 kicker
by Scout and No. 9 by Rivals out

of high school, said he’d have to -

adjust to being Pitt’s go-to kicker.
Since his freshman year, he had
competed with former kicker and
punter, Hutchins.

“It’s different now that he’s
moved on, and I’ve got to be the
man,” he said.

Harper was named to the Divi-
sion I All—0hio team as a senior
in high school.

So far in his college career,
he’s completed 10 kickoffs for

an average of 63.8 yards to go *~

along with one missed ﬁeld
goal attempt from 51 yards out.
Despite the lack of experience,
Harper sets big’ goals.

“If I had any goals I want to ac-
complish my next two years here
at Pitt, it’d be First Team All—Big
East, make an All-American team
and [earn] the Lou Groza kicking

award,” Harper said. I

“I think I have a chance to get drafted in
the later rounds,” DeCicco said. The senior
will graduate with a major in communica-
tion after Pitt’s ﬁrst summer session.
vs “My hunch is that he’ll probably be a
sixth to seventh round player,” Smith said.
“But it wouldn’t surprise me if he went in
the ﬁfth round, and it wouldn’t surprise me
if he went to free agency.”

pult him past some other prospects, as his
strong showing likely quieted any critics
of his skills.

“I think there were a lot of question
marks about his athletic ability that were’
answered on pro day,” Smith said. “He had
probably the best pro day of any of the Pitt
players.”

That, combined with his excellent ca-
reer at Pitt, could be incentive enough for
a team to announce DeCicco’s name at the

end of the month. In four years, DeCicco I

racked up 12 interceptions and 244 tackles.
He’s also led a relatively healthy career,
only missing one game this season with a
hamstring injury.

“The only real issue he ever had was a
little bit of that hamstring, which was some-
thing that was corrected,” Smith said.

Additionally, the defensive scheme that
DeCicco ran at Pitt closely resembled the
types that NFL teams use.

DeCicco benefits from strong pro day performance

“We played a pro—style defense here at
Pitt, so it was pretty easy to translate what
we did at Pitt to what the guys are teaching
at different NFL teams,” DeCicco said. “So
I felt that helped.”

Smith couldn’t reveal which teams ex-
pressed interest in DeCicco, but he did
provide a few hints.

“There’s an NFC North team that’s
showing a lot of interest in him,” Smith
said. “And I’ll say that he was a favorite of
Coach [Dave] Wannstedt, so I wouldn’t be
surprised if he followed coach Wannstedt
where he is now.” A

Wannstedt, Pitt’s former head coach,
recently accepted a job with the Buffalo
Bills as the assistant head coach and inside
linebackers coach.

“But he’s the type of player thatgcould
play on any NFL team, and every NFL team
needs a player like him —- for the special
teams, for the attitude, and for the intan-
gibles that a team looks for,” Smith said.

The draft takes place April 28-30 in
New York,- but the NFL, currently facing
labor disputes between the owners and
the players associations, is in the midst of
a lockout and the 2011 season appears to

‘_ be in jeopardy.

While the draft will take place during
the lockout, after it’s over teams will not be
able to sign free agents’, so both drafted and
undrafted players will need to wait until the
end of the lockout to sign contracts. A

“It’s 'a new territory, we’ve never seen
anything like this before,” Smith said. “We
don’t know if we’re going to get calls from
teams during the draft like we normally
do inquiring about free agents. It’s going
to be weird.” ‘

DeCicco said he plans on looking for a
job until the lockout ends, but right now
he’s focused on the draft.

“I just need to put myself in a position
to get drafted,” DeCicco said. “With the
lockout you can’t really sign with a team,
so that would be frustfating.” .

At this point, all he can do is wait. i

“Our young core is going to be here as long
as we can keep them.” Coonelly said, adding:
“We are going to pitch much better this year
than the guys in Pittsburgh did last year, but
knock on wood because it’s still early.”

New Pirates manager Clint Hurdle is also
considered a new ingredient to the team who

. might be able to lift them from their funk.
Hurdle already implemented a new policy

during spring training where coaches from

‘ contesting umpires calls.

“Clint has a big personality and a tre-

tive. I truly believe this team in 2011 is going

Not so lucky:
Baseball
transfers

But not all the players on Duquesne’s roster
were lucky enough to successfully ﬁnd a
new team. Freshman Nate Sphon attended
high’ school locally at Greensburg-Salem
and now attends Westminster College-

at Duquesne as a pitcher and didn’t know
where to turn once he heard the news that
the program was being cut. After this year,
Sphon plans to transfer back to the city of
Pittsburgh —~ just not to the university he
was originally supposed to attend. He will
start school at Point Park in the fall, where
he will join the team.

“When I found out, I was pretty much
devastated,” he said. “I was set on go-
ling there, and I really loved Duquesne.”
Left with nowhere to go, Sphon focused
on his next step.

“Basically, I knew I could play any-
where,” he said. “But the problem was
that most every team had a full roster and
was done recruiting, so where I was going
to play exactly was the question.”

He called his high school coaches and
some of his other connections and even-
tually ended up at Westminster College.
But Sphon’s trials didn’t end there, as, he
needed surgery performed on his arm and

missed this season. ‘ ’

He maintains full eligibility because he
took a medical redshirt last season.

Only two other former Duquesne play-
ers were able to ﬁnd another team out of
the 31 players that comprised the roster.
Pitchers Robert Corsi and Jim Devine
transferred to Rutgers and Temple, re-
spectively. ’ A

Back at Pitt, Devereaux is concentrat-
ing on ﬁnishing the rest of this season
successfully. A

“With all this being over, we are focused
on playing well, and we hope that we can
play well enough to reach the high goals
we have set for ourselves,” he said.
