On Parking

Set Monday

By NATHAN IVIARYN

Restricted parking went in-
to effect Monday, Nov. 11, on
Belleﬁeld Ave. and Dithridge
St., from Forbes St. to Fifth
Ave.

Many of the people who
usually park on these streets are

students at the University, and
most were caught unaware of the

"' restricted parking conditions when ‘

they came to class

morning.

Monday

240 Tagged

According to the Pittsburgh P0-
lice Traffic Division about 240
cars were tagged for violating “No
Parking” signs. No cars were tow-
ed away. The signs were posted on
Sunday afternoon.

No prior notice had been
given to either the public in
general or .the University in
particular.

The parking in the area has been
reserved for people attending the
Industrial College of Armed
Forces Natural Resources Con-
ference at the Mellon Institute.

' Warn People

Lt. Charles Ray, of the Uni-
versity Police said that if he had
known of the “No Parking” signs
he would have at least two of his
men on the street by 7 a.m.,i Mon-
day, to warn people not to park
there.

He was first informed of the
situation when someone came to
his office and told him the Pitts-
burgh Police were tagging cars.

Shortly after, Jack Hardman of
the Dean of Men’s office was no-
tified. He took the portable public
address system intothe Commons
Room and announced that anyone
who had had parked in the area
should move his car at once.

-4 In Error

Inspector Martin of the Traffic
Division said, late Monday, that

oﬁicer points to will enable the owner to park on

. . And A Wrong Way

 

 

TICKET—This piece of paper represents the loss
of ten dollars to the owner for parking‘ on public
streets that have been reserved for Armed Forces
men attending a conference at Mellon Institute.

the initial order was probably in
error and that the only area
which should have had “No Park-
ing” signs was Bellefield St. on
both sides frm Fifth Ave. to the
alley next to the YMWHA.

He said that he would put
out an order to «take down the
signs in the other areas. He said
the no parking condition in this
area will continue for about ten
days.

When people began to arrive in
the area Monday morning many
of them probably thought that the
signs were left up from the week-
end.

Games, Opera

There were two football games
and an opera performance in Oak-
land last week-end.

While many people were
caught by this error in thought,
there were still a number who

Medical
Spots TB

l§ULLETIN—-The Pitt Health
Campaign announced today that
it “desperately”"needs 300 more
volunteers to work during the
coming chest X-ray campaign
against Tuberculosis and the
anti-polio shot campaign. Vol-
unteers will be accepted at the
Health Campaign Headquarters
817 C1. Ext. 311.

‘ Chest X-ray apparatus will be
,brought to the University Nov. 20
Her a four—day campaign aimed at
‘providing Pitt students with the
opportunity to get a health Check-
up against major lung diseases.

The chest X-ray will not only
reveal symptoms of tuberculosis
but also symptoms of cancer of
the lung, certain heart conditions,
pleurisy, silicosis and possibly,
fungus diseases in the lungs.

The X-ray apparatus will not
return to Pitt for four years. Five
,years ago it was set up and re-
Emained for some seven weeks.
iliowever, the Pitt Health Cam-
,»paign plans to do the complete job
tin four days.

Joint Project
The equipment is provided by
the University as a joint project
of the Pennsylvania Department
of Health, Allegheny County
‘Health Department and The Tu-
berculosis League of Pittsburgh.
All costs for the set—up are paid
through Christmas seals.

An annual chest X-ray is the
best method ‘of finding unknown
TB——so that treatment can be-
gin before the germ has had
time to do too much damage.

undertook a study to determine
the number of known cases of tu-
berculosis ‘in Allegheny County.
More than four thousand known
TB cases were found in the total
Allegheny County population of
868,980 people.

In 1955, there were 76,177
newly reported active cases in
the United States and 14,796
people died from TB. Since then
there has been a decline in TB
deaths. The reason for this de-
cline is due to the new treat-
ment methods employed by TB
hospitals. ‘

One important fact that the Tu-
berculosis League of Pittsburgh
stresses is that TB kills more
Americans between the ages of 15
and 35 than any other disease.
Anyone can catch a tuberculosis
infection——anyone of any age,- and
of lither sex.

A new course in anthropology will be taught next semes-
ter .by,Dr. Peter B. Hammond,

assistant professor in the De-

Science Center.

Too frequently thought of as
a continent of jungles and “sav-
agery,” Africa actually has many
ancient and highly developed

civilizations.

Each of the cultural areas com-"
posing the continent will be de-
scribed and a representative eth-
nic group from each area will be
selected for more intensive study.
Special emphasis will be given to
West Africa, the region from
which slaves were brought to the
New World. ‘

Dr. Hammond believes that the
proper understanding of contem-
porary events in Africa must be
based on an understanding of the
African’s cultural heritage.

He will direct the attention of
the seminar toward an objective
appreciation of that heritage.
Dr. Hammond has an impressive

‘Entire 39th Floor

To Be Memorial A

For Late Trustee

By DONNA CONSIDINE
The late E. V. Babcock, long
time trustee of the Univer-
sity, hated the idea of an un-

ﬁnished Cathedral of Learn-
'ing. '

Therefore, he left funds to

‘be used towards the internal com-
pletion of the Gothic building.

Construction will begin next
month on the E. V. Babcock Mem-

forial Room which will encompass

the entire 39 floor.
Meeting Place
It will be used as a permanent

_meeting place for the Board of

Trustees and conference room for
special groups like the Dean’s

Council, according to Dr. A. C. A

Van Dusen, assistant chancellor in
planning and development.’
The construction crew is now
in the process of demolition on
the ﬂoor which was not in use.
An elevator is being installed
from the 36th floor.

T. L. ~Andrew"s, construction
superintendent for Crump Incorp-
orated, sums up the last month’s
period of demolition in this way.
.“We’ve been making a lot of noise
and dirt, and we’re scared people,

‘including ourselves because there
' is danger ‘involved in working

around elevator shafts.”
University Showplace
After it is completed in July, “it
will be a Showplace of the Uni-
versity and one of which we can
be really proud,” said Liles W.

’Creighton, executive assistant to

the director of the physical plant.
He went on to describe the
plans. There will be ﬂoor to
ceiling panelling of Appalachian
white oak trimmed in walnut.
Both are native woods. The
plaster ceiling will feature an
indirect cove and dome, and
carpeting will cover the ﬂoor.
Window’ alcoves will overlook
the city from the four sides of the
building. Concerning this plan,
Dr. Van Dusen stated, “I don't
know of any spot with a more
commanding View than this sum-
mit point from on top of the
Cathedral.”
Prominent Pittsburgher
E. V. Babcock, who was in -the
lumber business, was for a time
city councilman. During World
-‘War I he was mayor of Pitts-
burgh; then, County Commission-
er. His position as a trustee of the
University extended from Chan-
cellor McCormack’s to Chancellor
Fitzgerald’s

administrations, or
approximately 40 years.
Mrs. Babcock exclaims, “It

seems everlasting. I can’t re-
member a time when he wasn’t
a trustee or interested in Pitt.”
He was especially fond of the
Pitt Band. He bought the first uni-
forms of the present style, helped
send it to the Rose Bowl in 1937,
and supported it in other ways.
Mrs. Babcock will never forget

~ the band's tribute to her husband

soon after his death nine years
ago. She described the formation
of his initials, E. V. B. in honor
of its patron.

When Babcock had the oppor-

acres of farmland‘ outside the
city, a few acres at a time, he
did so. He turned over his col-
lections of property to. the city.
They become North and South
Park.” Babcock Boulevard bears
his name. '

The Babcock Room on the 39th
floor will be highlighted by a
memorial inscription to its donor.
Dr. _Van Dusen commented‘ that
the University "is particularly
grateful to the Babcock family for
making this magniﬁcent faiclity
available through the estate and
gifts of Mrs. Babcock.

Her reaction to the future con-

Dr. Van Dusen’s. —“I am very

happy with this wonderful‘ addi-
tion to a marvelousvbuilding.”

SC To Assist Adams

  n Representatives

By EDWIN ZINMAN V

Student Congress will establish a special subcommittee
to assist Bernard Adams, Director of Admissions, on the stu-
dent level of the admissions program. Today the executive
committee will appoint two representatives to meet with
Adams to formulate future plans and policy.

‘President Phil Parkinson,

could conceivably send studentO

representatives to» various high
schools outside the state since this
type of public relations is often
highly successful. “As a supple-
ment, it is also possible to event-
ually establish a student organi-
zation which would conduct tours
of the entire university, again
demonstrating student participa-
tion in public relations.”

Howard Rossen, Col. ’58, sub-

mitted .at 'Monday’s meeting his"

subcommittee’s . report on the
evaluation of , student government
for Congress’ review.

Rossen stated, “Our committee’s
ﬁndings call for revision of SC’s
constitution into a supreme Stu-
dent Government Organization
with certain regulatory‘ powers
over other student governments.
This would eliminate parallel-
isms ingovernment presently in
existence.”

Congress will take action next
week on the report which de-
velops a plan for responsible
student government based upon
a new concept of representation,
scope, and committees.

Following SC approval it will
be submitted to Dr. Peake, assist-

  Parking, In Error

Further restrictions have been imposed 'on the already
too-tight Oakland Area.

A The current misadventure in trafﬁc planning is of a
temporary nature but it does point out something that is
all too apparent around the University. , _
' Any alliance that exists between the mayor’s office
and the chancellor’s ofﬁce is strictly one-sided when it
" comes to the Parking Problem. ‘

In fact, since there is obviously a policy of recognition
of certain ‘privileged classes by the Traffic Planning Engi-
neer in the Oakland situation, there is no reason why Pitt
cannot be recognized as also signiﬁcant.

East year, when the personnel of Carnegie Library,
the members of the PAA and the Masonic Temple, com-
plained of the all-day parking, ‘they were answered im-
mediately by the installation of parking meters“ and further
time restrictions. ~ , -

' This move made it'handy,for the in and out parking of
the patrons of these organizations, but it seriously out down
on the parking abilities of the FULL-TIME students, fac-
ulty, and administration of the University. ‘

A latest insult gives PRIVATE ON—STREET PARKING

‘ to a few visiting brass who are attending a conference in
Mellon Institute.

And the most remarkable thing about the situation was
that the signs were posted over an area three times the size
of that requested by the Traﬁic Division. This lower echelon
blunder originated in an erroneous order which was
brought to the reluctant attention of Inspector Martin by a
PITT NEWS reporter. ‘ r -

b The ‘quick results of the complaints by Carnegie
Library, the PAA, and the Masonic Temple are .in.out-
.ragVeous contrast to the complete angol utter neglect of many
requests for better control of auto and pedestrian traffic
on Bigelow and Fifth issued by the University. .

, Mr. Gaittens has chosen to ignore the real problem of
the Oakland area. He has instead increased the headaches
by allowing the police department to bungle through day-
to-day problems_with stop—gap and makeshift measures.
There has been little or no evidence of consideration of the

7University’s needs over a broad based plan. P
I The only construction of off—street parking areas has
been undertaken by the University notthe city. Where is
the “close relationship with this great City” that‘ the Chan-
cellor spoke of? Where is the cooperation “that our Mayor
has pledged?

Before the University tries to shoulder up to Harvard }
and Columbia, maybe it should take a few bumps at being

recognized by the City whose’ name it plans-to carry up
there.

' Called by such names asthe sick story, the sick
joke, or the ‘gruesome, these jokes, if indeed they
can be called such, get” their laughs by poking fun
at amputation, disease and .

death. Any'type of physical dis-
ability" or horror_ is fair game
for sick joke. The following are
a few samples:

coin, how did you -enjoy the

Mom over the cliff.”

Other brother: “Don’t make
me laugh, my li-ps_ are chapped.”

“Ma, can I go swimming?
“No your ‘hooks will get rusty.

Mommy, why do I keep walking in circles?
Shut up, or‘ I’ll nail your other foot to the
floor.

Mrs. Smith can Johnny come out to'play base-

No, he hasn’t any arms or legs.

We know that; we want him to be the second

Though not wishing to divulge any secrets
about my morbid sense of humor, I must confess
to getting quite a chuckle from some of these on
ﬁrst hearing them.

However, their appeal seems to be rather lim-
ited. You hear the joke, involuntarily think it
funny, and then your conscience makes you wonder
why you even smiled. ~

What is the reason for this morbid, sadistic type
of humor? Gerald Walker, writing in the current
issue of “Esquire” states that “humor is a kind of
grass-roots barometer of the way people currently
think and feel.” I
Form of Rebellion .

If thixs is true, what is the rason behind the ac-

ceptance of these jokes by present day Americans?
Mr. Walker points out that “though some psy-
chiatrists disagree, the most persuasive conclusion
is that the sick joke is a rebellion against responsi-
bility.”

Child Psychologist Martha Wolfenstein, author
of “Children’s Humor” thinks it may be due to “all
the noble sentiments that the public is constantly
being asked to turn out. There is the tear-jerking
matter of the mass media and television’s misery
shows which encourage people to relate their sor-
rows before a microphone.” It is this constant
strain on a person’s emotions that Doctor Wolfen-
stein believes is causing the sick joke fad.

Another possible theory is advanced by Doctor‘

Theodor Reik, a long time co-worker of Sigmund‘”V.,’~*

Freud’s, who believes the jokes to be “an expres-
sion of youth’s rebellion .against their parents’
overzealous search for salvation, and they (the
jokes) are a sign that the young people are looking
for answers more satisfying than those suggested
by their parents.”

_No+ Sick Al All

“In that sense,” Doctor Reik adds, “I don’t think

’ they are sick at all. -As for the form this ﬁnal re-

bellion takes—the cynicism and the crudeness of
the jokes———this is an over-reaction to the extreme
conservation of theirelders.” -

These and other slightly varying explanations
are advanced by those who are supposedly in the
best position to know and interpret human be-
havior. ,Most authorities tend to ‘agree, however,
that the jokes are a form of rebellion against
someone or something. '

It seems that while the form of these jokes is-_

new, the idea is merely a revision of the same type
of humor popular in the past. So present day ad-
vocates of the sick jokes need not feel they are
any more ghoulish then folks back in grandpa’s time

\who took great delight“in much the same type of

humor.

Nevertheless, those of you who took even a
small measure of delight from the jokes presented.
as samples earlier should feel mighty ashamed of
yourselves. I 

Still though, that one about the kid with his
foot nailed to the floor walking around in circles
was pretty funny.

made clear to
me on a recent
visit to a co-
educational Ivy
school. I set
out purposely
to conceal my
role as a visit- '
ing student. ~.
With a quick 4
tour of the campus and close ob-
servation of student dress, I as-
sumed the habits of the co-eds.
Presto, I became part of the
local scenery, so completely that
I was mistaken for a local stu-
dent.

Yet on the very campus ‘where
it was so easy for a stranger to

ed down on fellow students for
shallow reasons. Here is an ex-
cerpt from one conversation.

“That Lois! She’s so out of it!

 

majority of us would, I’m afraid,
be “out of it.”

My second point, however,
could easily become part of Pitt
life with the gradual increase in
resident students. I refer to
cliquishness, or separation of

' resident students from commut-

ing students in University ac-
tivities.

Although the problem has not
yet arisen at Pitt, weare aware
of it through our contact with
other schools, through confer-
ences in student government and
student affairs.

For instance, at such a meet-
ing at an Ohio college last win-
ter, mest of the institutions with
both residents and commuters
were beseiged with problems of
lack of social unity. Every one
of these campuses had separate
facilities for the two groups by
means of different lounges in

Lettersl To The

Editor, The Pitt News:

Certainly most people would
agree that the denominational
choice of a man is not open to
judgment, but the beliefs he
holds and his method of arriving
at ‘them is open to question:

Mr. Jacobs, in his article of
Nov. 11, argues for the medieval
acceptance of both the existence
of God and- the matter of faith
in the very manner which he
seems to deplore, that of self-

righteousness and narrowness.
, After having consi_dered"]Hit-
ler, Stalin, and Kruschev, I still
ﬁnd hisassertion that those who
do not believe in God, even

  

process to be applied to religion,
are thick-skulled, dim-witted
egomaniacs one of the most in-
sipid statements printed in the
News’ ‘editorial columns.

Mr. Jacobs’ s e l f - righteous
statements concerning those‘ who
do not believe are, to me, a de-
ﬁnite argument for the applica-
tion of logic‘ to matters of faith
and religion. For he has suc-
ceeded so well in sealing off the
logic.-tight c o m p a r t m en t in

‘ which he carries his beliefs that
he seems to have great difficulty
in correlating them with his ac-

. tions. There is no exact religion,

which I knowof, that condones,

mains the danger of the dormi-
tory students’ not striving to as-
sociate with the commuter out-
side the classroom.

My last observation refers
speciﬁcally to Pitt. The scene
was the Tuck Shop during the
noon hour. A clean-cut, well-
mannered boy asked a group, of
seated students for permission
to occupy the empty seat next to
them.

After he had gobbled his ,. ,
sandwich and milk, he thanked.
them and went away hurriedly
to the -tune of giggles and laugh-
ter. “What is he‘? New around
here or something?” piped up
one member of the group.

Finally, an on-looker squelch-
ed the questioners: “It’s obvious
he’s an exchange student.”

The remark quelled the mock-
ery, ‘but the scene showed the
lack of consideration for"the
manners and mores of other
culture which is nothing more
than snobbism. "

ance and the lack of understand-

ing which he displays.

Furthermore, Mr. Yacobs says,
“In matters which pertain to the
spiritual aspect of man, there can
be no absolute right or absolute
wrong.” Then he continues to try ‘
to prove that although those who
do believe may not be absolutely
right, those who do not are ab-
solutely wrong.

It would appear that if Mr. ‘
Jacobs does not care to apply
reason to his religious beliefs he
should at least” apply it to his 
literary argument. P I

the recent report on scholarship
records of social fraternities was
analyzed.

The report, published in full
in last week’s PITT NEVVS,
showed the all-fraternity men’s

Q

So often, the college graduate is con- ’

fronted with the problem of liking the job
which is offered but not the location in which
he must live. If this is your problem, you
should consider the Pennsylvania electric
power companies. With them, you can choose
almost any location in beautifuland prosperous
Pennsylvania. Here you will find the oppor-
tunity to fulﬁll your working, living and
recreational desires. V '

. A FUTURE ?

The Pennsylvania electric utility com-
panies have doubled their output during the
past ten years, and will again double it during
the next ten. Moreover theirs is a product upon
which our nation is dependent for its growth
and security. Where else can you ﬁnd so
bright a future?

. A VARIETY OF INTERESTS?

The Pennsylvania electric power com-
panies can offer you a job in Power Plant
Engineering, Field Engineering, Community
Development, System Planning, Transmission
and Distribution Engineering, and many
others. It is one of the few industries in which
you can ﬁnd the ﬁeld which interests you most.
Talk to your placement counselor or to the
personnel director of one of Pennsylvania’s
electric power companies. Or, write to
Pennsylvania Electric Association, State Street
Building, Harrisburg, Pa., stating whereyou
would like to live and work.

Panthers To Begin New

Reconditioning Process

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

'iThere is a “No Visitors” sign hanging on the barricade to

the Panther’s den this week, To say that the battered Jungle
Cat is licking his wounds is to be guilty of understatement.
He is undergoing complete reconditioning in order to re-

. spectably complete the campaign.

The Panther, after absorbing his fourth straight loss on

Saturday at the point of a
Mountain musket, has a provi-
dential week off to regroup his
limping forces. The Nittany
Lions from Penn State way will
come to call a week fr ~.n Satur-
day and they will be looking for
continued hospitality on the part
of the locals.

It is hoped that by that date,
November 23, the Blue and Gold

2 injury list will be reduced and

Coach John‘ Michelson’s charges
can make a real ﬁght of the tra-
ditional struggle. The current Pan-
-therrecord or three wins and ﬁve
defeats is the worst during’ the
‘three-year tenure of Coach Mich-
elosen and the four game losing
streak is the longest since 1951
when the Panthers dropped their
ﬁrst sev-en straight.

Team Wins Third

Pitt’s Women's Hockey team
will he driving for their fourth
consecutive win today in as many
starts, when ‘they play Sewickly
Girls School at 4:30 on the Cath-
edral Lawn.

The team led by Sarah Finnin

and Karyl Kumer at wing posi-

tion, two of last years. outstand-
ing players, will be playing hard
to defeat the only team that beat
Pitt last year. _ ‘

Pitt victories so far this year-

have shown two wins over Car-
negie Tech, 2-0 and 3-0. Their
third victory was against the fast-
moving Ellis Girls School by a
close 2-1 score.

Booters Travel To West Point  
With Hopes of Winning Seventh

By JIM LACEY
The Panther Booters travel to West Point this Saturday
with hopes of picking up win number seven against a highly

improved Cadet squad.

The Blue and Gold should be in better physical

condition

for the Cadets than they were for the game with the Mid-
shipmen. Dick Kipp will be able to play this week since his

twisted ankle well healed. Thee

iHarriers Depend

other players are over their minor
bumps and bruises.

Simeon Pestich has quiely
worked his way from the alter-
nate unit to the starting one.
Pestich has scored two goals to
lead the sophomores in scoring.

The Black Knights of the Hud-
son will present a strong team of
ten veterans. This gives coach
John Kress a brighter outlook of
improving a 3-5-2 record which is
comparable to the record held. by
the Panthers last year.

Goalie Fred Manzo will be the
mainstay of the defense, while a
completely veteran forward line
will provide the offense. Les Gib-
bings, Tom Carpenter, Bill Roos-
ma, Bob Puff, Juan Villanes com-
prise the forward wall that is

‘heavily counted upon by Coach

Kress.

Puff, the inside right, will
captain the team that has so_ far
rolled. up a 6-2 record. The
Cadets and midshipmen play a
similar brand of soccer, that is,
a fast short passing game.

The Cadets and the Blue and
Gold played to a I-1 tie last year
at the stadium. It was almost the
same team that will face the
Panthers next Saturday at the
Point. -

After this Saturday’s game the
Blie and Gold will be near the
completion of their schedule. They
will travel to University Park to
meet the Nittany Lions in the
season’s ﬁnale.

On Team Balance

For Final Victory

Coach Carl Olson’s harriers
ﬁnished their regular dual meet
season by defeating the Univers-
ity of Kentucky, 25-34. The boys

from the Bluegrass state found _

the 30 degree temperature and
the continuous snow flurries not
to their liking.

As in last week's meet, good
team abalance was again the an-
swer. The Wildcats placed the
ﬁrst two men but not until six
Panthers crossed the ﬁnish line,
did another Kentuckian ﬁnish.

George Walters. Ron Rush,
and John Christof ﬁnished in a
three way tie for third place in
the time_ of 23:47 only 18 sec-
onds behind the winner who
covered the Schenley P ark
course of 4.3 miles. in 23:23.

Rounding out the Pitt ﬁrst ten
ﬁnishers were Ron Goldstein,
Vince Wojnar, and Sam Gris-
ciotti who ﬁnished sixth, seventh,
and eighth respectively.

The Panthers now have a ﬁve
and two record with only the
ICAAAA coming up this weekend

to ﬁnish their season.

Cub Hoopsters

Begin Practice
By LARRY HAGGERTY

Coach Carl Peterson’s freshman
basketball team is busily prepar-
ing for their opening game against
Johnstown Center at the Field
House on Wednesday evening, De-
cember 4. The .hoopsters have
been using the ﬂoor in the Sta-
dium for their daily practice ses-
sions.

Last Friday, Peterson took his
ﬁrst team up to the Field House
to scrimmage the varsity. The
main purpose of the drill was to
acquaint the yearlings with the
various defensive patterns they
will be using this season.

.4 Varsity coach, Bob Timmons,

has brought in two promising
stars from Kentucky to bolster
the Blue and Gold yearlings.
The new prospects are Darwin
Smith and Howard Lockhart.

Another promising newcomer is .

Paul Lazor. Lazor is the younger
brother of Bob Lazor who is listed
among the Panther high scorers.
However, the young Lazor seems
-destined to do just as well since
he gained an WPIAL honors at
Canonsburg High the last two
two seasons. ,

Pete Suder, son of the Philadel-
phia A’s former great inﬁelder,
was the leading scorer in the,ﬁrst
actual scrimmage that Peterson
held. He hails from Aliquippa, and
led his team in scoring last year.

The so called “ﬁrst unit,” as v

of now at least, shows Smith
and Lockhart at forward, Lazor
at center, and Suder and John
Fridley holding down the guard
positions. Fridley was a forward
on last season’s state champion-
ship team, the Sharon Bengals.
A pair of Central Catholic grad-
uates, Jim Foley and Paul
Pietrzyk, are pressing hard in an
attempt to break into the starting
ﬁve. “The two are adjusting to
our system quite well,” comment-
ed Peterson.
Nick Sutyak, Rick Bickel, Dick
Falenski, Ray Kasper, Don Steer-
man, Bill Malarkey, Jim Hedges,

‘Reid Crookston, Wynn Jones, and
Bill Schipani round out this year’s u
, squad. .

“This year’s team is working .

sixty ‘minute man in almost every
game. ”

after graduation, he has a contract
to fill with the Army. When this is
over he vwants to be a geologist
for an oil company.

around campus, is active in
school affairs. He is a member

Fraternity. In his free time he-
enjoys hunting and ﬁshing, but
he admits he has little time to
do either.

With football and extra curricu-
lar activities one might think he
has little time to hit the books. To
the contrary, Ron maintains a
good average. His favorite courses

A MESSAGE To THE SENOR

WTHTOMORROW  

ON HIS MIND

Melpar’s sure, ‘swift growth during
the past eleven years — we have
doubled in size every 24 months —
is due, in large part, to the out-
standing performanceof our engi-
neering staff. .

As a leading R & D organization,
we are constantly called upon to
perform tasks which have never
been done before. Thanks to the
creative talent which forms the
backbone of our organization, we
have grown rapidly both in stature
and size. Members of our’ staff
have enjoyed similarly reward-
ing growth.

Performance Determines Ad-
vancement. Individual recogni-
tion is a fundamental policy I at
Melpar. Each‘ engineer is advanced
on the basis of his performance.‘
The average age of our engineer-
ing staff (one of the industry’s
youngest) and the rapidity of

‘growth of above-average staff

members, are clear indications of
what Me1par’s individual recogni-
tion policy can mean to you.

BECAUSE OF OUR WIDE DIVERSIFICATION, OPENINGS EXIST IN

Project Teams. As a Melpar staff
member you will enjoy the oppor-
tunity to participate in entire’
projects, from conception to com-
pletion of prototype. Our project
team basis of organization gives
you the satisfaction of seeing your
own efforts materialize, and helps
you acquire experience essential
to eventual managerial responsi-
bility.

Fine Living Conditions. Melpar
laboratories are located in choice
suburban. areas near Washington,
D. C. and Boston, Massachusetts.

of their proximity to outstanding
educational, cultural. and research
facilities. Fine housing in all price

Facilities. Melpar offers complete
facilities for creative research and
design. Our headquarters labora-
tory near Washington, D. C.
