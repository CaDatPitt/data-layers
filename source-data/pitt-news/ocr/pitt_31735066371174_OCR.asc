Provost monitors
para-legal program

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

The Provost’s Office has agreed to
a request by the Faculty Assembly to
monitor Pitt’s recently-created para-

legal program. The assembly had
been opposed to the program
because of both its financial

demands and its coming so soon
after the dismantling of the geo-
graphy department.

Richard Tobias, president of the
Faculty Assembly, said, “We can't
block the program. Students are
coming into it this term.“

Tobias and the assembly con-
sented to the program at its monthly
meeting yesterday after receiving
assurance from the Provost’s Office
that the program would be watched
closely.

ln other business:

The recent increase in Blue Cross
and Blue Shield rates for faculty
members came totally by surprise,
according to James Holland, chair-
man of the Senate Health and Wel-
fare Committee. Holland said that
instead of going through proper
channels and notifing his commit-
tee, Blue Cross simply mailed out

memos to the faculty telling of the
increase.

The assembly is trying to explore
ways in which Pitt's $8 million dollar
annual medical bill can be trimmed
down. A new exercise program for
the faculty which would utilize uni-
versity facilities is in the planning
stage. Parts of this program would
include stress work shops, smoking
clinics and exercise.

Holland said,“We can save money
by having arhealthy staff."

Other subjects discussed at the
meeting included the proposed key
security plan, which would keep
track the number and availability of
keys given to faculty and staff. The
assembly is in favor ofthe proposal.

Faculty meeting are attended by
representives of Pitt’s four branch
campuses. A motion to "study the
feasibility of a phone network to”
eliminate travel was made, and a
committee will study the viability of
such a network.

The meeting also included a
lengthy debate on Roberts Rule of
Order after a problem arose at last
month’s meeting and affected an
important vote that later received a
good deal of media attention. The
Faculty Assembly will have a parli-
mentarian present at future meet-
ings to avoid the problem.

Ten years

Womens’ center marks anniversary

By Deborah Nichols
The Pitt News

‘The Oakland Women's Center is
celebrating is 10th anniversary ~
commemorating a decade colored
by transition and struggle, both of
which continue to threaten its
existence.

The center was once a part of the
University of Pittsburgh, located at
603 Bruce Hall.

“It was a pretty decent space,“
said Cynthia Vanda, who was the
center‘s first director. “One room
was my office, another was a
secretary—reception area, and there
was a meeting room. There was a
small kitchen —-- since it had been an
apartment --—— and we used this as a
counseling area." She laughed at the
familiar image of women counseling
each other in the kitchen.

Like many of the center's activi-
ties, counseling developed in

, response to calls from women who

couldn’t find what they needed any-
where else.
Vanda, now special assistant to

‘ the provost for women, was in on the

 

Fresh ideas

list...page 6

New Student Government Board president Ken
Stram pieces faculty unionization at the top of his

development of the center from its
inception. The center was an out-
growth of the activities ofthe Chan-
cellor’s Advisory Council on
Women’s Opportunities (ACWO),
which was appointed by Wesley
Posvar in 1970 to “investigate the
situation of women at Pitt.”

The council was provided with a
secretary, an office and a modest
budget. The idea for a women’s cen-
ter grew from the way in which peo-
ple began to call upon the council
itselfas a resource as well as from the
issues that ACWO studied.

ln 1972. Vanda helped to write a
proposal which was later passed by
the University Senate, mandating
the creation of a University
Women's Center. The university
allocated a budget for the center of
$32,000, about three-fourths of
which was used forthe salaries ofthe
director and a staff person.

In 1978, the center moved to a
temporary location upstairs at 3814
Forbes Ave., and a year later, it
moved to its present, street-level
location at 3802 Forbes Ave. Dis-
cussing the move, Vanda said the
staff wanted a store-front location
for exposure.

Pitt sophomore guard Bryan Mitchell (right) has decided to

The center has prospered in its
new, permanent location, according
to Vanda. ln its last active year with
the university, the center served
10,000 people with counseling,
information, referrals and other
services.

“We did discover that when you
hang out your shingle, people call on
you for help,” she said.

The center was serving its purpose
and had not finished doing so when
its budget became a casualty of uni-
versity retrenchment, Vanda said. In
the summer of 1980, Vanda said she
was informed that the center was
about to receive its last year of
funding.

An active campaign of protest and
a demonstration of support for the
center followed. A petition of over
1,000 signatures is preserved in the
present director’s office. As a result,
the center received one more year of
university funding. In fiscal 1981-
1982, the center's budget was
$50,000.

Times have been leaner since then.

1n the summer of 1982, an ad hoc
Committee to Save the Women’s
Center was faced with a frustrating
situation. The center was still offi-

cially an administrative office ofthe
university, but it was without uni-
versity funds. Though forced to seek
outside funding, the center was
prohibited by the administration
from apporaching any donor who
had already given to Pitt. This elimi-
nated all of the major funding
sources. e

The center later managed to
secure from a private foundation a
grant of $15,000, which became the
center’s budget for the year. Pitt
continues to supply the Women‘s
Center space.

Vanda said that discussions with
various Pitt administrators led to
support for someone’s working on
women’s issues internally, and since
the summer of 1982, Vanda has been
Special Assistant to the Provost for
Women.

Vanda’s office is the university’s
liaison with the Oakland Women’s
Center, and —Vanda herself is a
member of the center’s new board of
directors.

“The center needed new blood. 1
had done as much as 1 could ~ but
not all that could be done," she said
referring to her resignation. “The

Outstanding

The Pitt News

Thirty-eight Pitt professors have
been nominated for the first annual
Chancellor's Distinguished Teach-
ing Awards, according to the Office
of Faculty Development.

The awards carry not only pres-
tige, but a $1,000 cash prize to each
of the winners and another $ 1 ,000 to_
their respective departments or
schools. There is a limit of eight
awards given annually.

“We are very pleased with the
nominations that we have received.
This shows an awareness and a need
for the teaching awards program,"
said Robert L. Wolke, director of
the Office of Faculty Development.

Each dean from the nominees’
schools has appointed a committee
of three people to check into the
nominees’ qualifications. The com-
mittees are presently confirming the
professors‘ eligibility and retrieving
student evaluations in preparation
for the Honors Convocation in
March, when the winners -will be
announced.

Artemis Agras of the Office of
Faculty Development would not
release the names of the nominees or
nominators. but did say that 27 per-
cent of the professors were nomi-
nated by various student
organizations and ad hoc student
groups. The remainder were named
by chairpersons, colleagues, alumni,
deans and student advisors.

The program is not unique to this
university. California and New York
are among the state university sys-
tems in which successful teacher’s
awards programs have been imple-
mented. Others haven’t been as suc-
cessful, though.

“Other schools have run into trou-
ble with awards programs because
they were just popularity contests,”
Wolfe said. “Ours is set up to have
the highest possible credibility.
When a person is selected for an
award, we have carefully investi-
gated all aspects of his or her
teaching.

“As in any new program, there are
a few bugs that we have to work out,
such as the much-more-than-
expected amount of work involved
with the selection process," he said,
adding that the committees have
been sorting through the 38 applica-
tions since the Nov. 1 deadline.

Along with the cash awards,
which come from a $250,000 endow-
ment set aside from unrestricted
funds of the $50 million Capital
Campaign, the winners receive a cer-
tificate signed by the chancellor and
provost, an inscription on * a
publicly-displayed plaque and inclu-
sion in the Didactikos Society,
which will be the cumulative group
of awardees.

The first weekend of the Winter
Term promises more reasonable
temperatures than those ofthe holi-
day break as well as a flurry of acti-
vities for those still not ready to
begin the studying grind.

The Pitt Program Council will
begin its first weekend of offerings
with a film shot right here in the
Oakland area. “Flashdance." the
story ofa young Pittsburgh female’s
climb from the steel mill to the stage.
will be playing at David Lawrence
Auditorium on Friday and
Saturday.

Forget the premise ofa young girl
working in the midst of 50 percent
unemployment in the mills and look
past the edited footage of Pittsburgh
(i.e. the Duquense lncline does not
leave one in South Side), and the
film offers an undeniable energy.

PPC will also be showing the film
“Videodrome” on Sunday in the
Multi-Purpose Room of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. This is horror-
mastér’ David Cronenberg’s

surrealistic look into the possibili-
ties of everyone‘s big brother ~ the

television. Nobody should miss
Deborah Harry, late of the rock
group Blondie, as she literally comes
alive on the l9—inch color set.

The Carnegie Museum of Art’s
Film and Video section will be offer-
ing cinema of a different sort on
Saturday evening with the premier
of a documentary, “Murray
Avenue: A Community in Transi-
tion." The 30-minute film will be
attended by its creator. Sheila Cha-
movitz. as well as anthropologist

I Dr. Myrna Silverman and cultural

commentator Shalom Comay, who
will lead a discussion following the
screening.

The more athletic at heart can
head for the Schenley Park lce Skat-
ing Rink. Session will be held I-3

Womens’ Center marks anniversary

Q

center is very lucky to have found
someone like Gale [McGloin, the
center's new director]‘.’’

“I think Cynthia felt very strongly

I about the connection between the
university and the community, and I
do, too,” McGloin said. “We have
built up a reliable presence in the
community."

The center provides both career
and personal counseling, backed up

Qly a library of career materials,
women's books and magazines and
file collections on women issues. A
variety of women's groups also
meets at the center. ,

McGloin called the atmosphere
“low—key feminist.”

“In these hard economic times,
social service agencies have become
the front lines in dealing with dis-
placed homemakers, the unem-
ployed and the new poor,” she said.
An advantage of the Women’s Cen-
ter’s services is that “people don’t
feel like they’re being processed

i when they come in here.”

Lacking money for staff salaries,
the center has depended on coopera-
tion with other groups in order to
keep the doors open and the tele-
phones active full-time. The center
enjoys part-time secretarial and
receptionist help, provided by both
the Pittsburgh Catholic Education
Program and the Program for

. Female Offenders, and also has a

 volunteer staff.

One volunteer is Susanna Moore,
who first came to the center as a
client. “I was looking to change
careers," Moore says. “Someone
recommended the center, and I went
in and saw Gale.” Moore, who had
work experience and two years of
college, came to Pittsburgh when
her husband was transferred. She
has two children. Moore said that
McGloin helped her look at her

3 situation realistically. “She chan-

neled me into going back to school,”
Moore said.

Once enrolled at Pitt, Moore con-
tinued her involvement at the center.
“It became important to me as a pol-
itical ideal to keep it running, to
keep the doors open," she said.

Now, the center has received the
status of a non-profit organization
and has a board of directors. Trudy
Bayer is president of this board,

"whose 15 members are all women.

“It was very important that the

(above) gives personal counseling.

well-represented," Bayer said. “We
have a balance of .professions and a
racial balance, with women from
business, social services, university,
volunteer and professional back-
rounds. Board members are not
remunerated. ,

“This is a time oftra.nsition for us.
We want to learn how to be effective
and operate best. We will be re-
evaluating the direction of the
Women’s Center,” Bayer explained.

The board will explore new ways
to extend the present services of the
center. “We are interested in hook-
ing up with other women‘s services
in Pittsburgh," said Bayer. One of
the projects under discussion is link-
ing the center’s job search programs
with the Women’s Shelter. The cen-
ter wants to continue to offer servi-
ces from which “no one is excluded
because of inability to pay,” Bayer
said.

The board is also involved in the
center‘s membership campaign. Let-
ters have already been sent out to the
center’s regular mailing list of sup-
porters and clients, explaining that,
under the new status, people can
support the center with a
membership.

A Phone-a-thon is planned for

McGloin. “We want to include eve-
rybody,” she said. Later this year,
questionnaires will be sent to the
new members in order to help the
center provide responsive program-
ming. “We want to expend more
energy toward our constituency and
grass-roots activities,“ McGloin
explained. “We need to build up our
membership and activity among our
membership.”

Reflecting on the center’s history,
McGloin made some observations
about the situation now and in the
future. “I believe that there are cer-
tain parameters in society that you
can push. There was lots of support
for non-traditional kinds of activi-
ties in the late ‘60s and mid-'70s," she
said. When money got tighter and
after the Vietnam War ended, sup-
port was withdrawn from many of
these, she added. “At the same time
that pressure on students to getjobs
increased, the university cut services
that helped students adjust."

I 'l he center has faced nearly a
decade of budget struggles and sur-
viyed and continues to support its
clients and community while at the
same time reaching out for support.
There is no question, however, that
the future will bring its share ‘of

Standing Room Only

When the Pitt Panther basketball team entertains the Uni-
versity of Connecticut tomorrow afternoon at the Fitzgerald
Field House, there will be no more than 2,000 students in
attendance. The athletic department has made sure of that.

While the intention behind the new student ticket policy may
have the best interests of crowd safety in mind, it fails to
consider the students, and is clearly only a temporary solution
to a problem to which the athletic department must give greater
attention. . -

The new ticket policy for the Panthers‘ next nine home
basketball games requires that students obtain a ticket with
their student ID prior to the game. While this will alleviate
some of the dangerous overcrowding experienced last year in
games against nationally-ranked teams, it neither eliminates
the problem of Iinconvenience, nor does it help to promote
enthusiasm among the student body.

The problem is a simple one of supply and demand. When
teams such as Georgetown and St. J ohn’s come to Pitt, there is
not enough of a supply of seats in the ﬁeld house to meet the
demand of both the students and the general public.

The question facing the athletic department then becomes
one of priority. This new policy places the student somewhere
‘on the lower half of their list.

A more reasonable method of ticket distribution would have
been to issue students one ticket, which could be taken to the
game and punched. While not every student at the university
can fit into the Field House, more than 2,000 should be
afforded the opportunity to see the Panthers basketball team.
If a ticket fee would be needed to cover the costs of such a
program, it would be better than leaving students searching for
the nearest cable TV hookup.

The revenue generated by the new Big East television pack-
age —— which ensures every team a minimum of $500,000 —— far
exceeds the income produced by the basketball program in
years past. Together with record-breaking season ticket pur-
chases, the basketball program is. in a more solid financial
situation than ever before and could easily gross $1 million this
year. It seems reasonable that the students would benefit from
this, but instead they are being left to fend for their seats.

Meanwhile, the athletic department is left drooling over the
prospect of I500 remaining tickets which'it can peddle to the

. buying public. The profit margin seems to have clouded the

.oncepts of enthusiasm for which university athletic depart-
ments cry so often, but which they practice so rarely.

Letters To The Editor

It

In defense of internships b

Although I share the concern with
the current status of the student
Internship Office as expressed in
your editorial of Jan. 4, 1984, I feel it
necessary to comment on one of the
statements made therein.

To my knowledge, no one has
“proven that the present tuition rate
is adequate to fund the office at its
previous level." If past Internship
Office and Counseling and Student
Development Center annual reports
are correct, it is possible that for-
credit internships may generate tui-
tion revenues sufficient to cover the
costs of a viable office staff.

The Educational Policies-Budget
Policies subcommittee which pre-
pared the resolution for Senate
Council did not have sufficient
information to “prove” this to be the
case. Your conclusion, though, is a
reasonable inference from the infor-
mation available.

However, I believe the budget-
reduction rationale given for discon-
tinuing the Internship Office under
the Office of Student Affairs has
caused a misplaced focus through-
out the current controversy. The
academic, public relations and
placement benefits of a strong
Internship Office alone justify its
existence and proper staffing.

The fact that tuition revenues are
also generated only serves to streng-
then the justification for a viable
Internship Office.

It is my belief that an Internship
Office staffed by a single graduate
student assistant will provide neither

the continuity necessary to develop
proper agency and business contacts
nor the coverage necessary to ade-

I understand the resolution adopted
by Senate Council to place a “high

Internship Office and its staffing
needs.

Jesse Jackson’s recent success in
securing the release of Lt. Robert
Goodman has brought mixed reac-
tions and red faces to the many
Republicans and Democrats who
had criticized Jackson’s trip to
Syria. It also has completely
changed the nature of the upcoming
presidential election. '

Before Jackson’s Middle East
mission, few Democrats had paid
much attention to the Jackson can-
didacy. With the release of Good-
man, Jackson has firmly secured his

has established himself as a credible
negotiator who gets results. Jackson
can no longer be ignored as a candi-
date or held out as a token of Demo-
cratic liberalism in an" otherwise
conservaitve group of office seekers.

Jackson still has severe difficul-
ties, however, being considered a

' viable presidential candidate. Jack-

son does not carry enough political
power to take the Democratic nomi-
nation. He is still viewed by his own
party -— except for the most liberal
of Democrats —— as leaning too far to

Jackson and many other political
aspirants, the prejudices that still
infect this country are bound to keep
valuable leaders out of office.

Even though it is very doubtful
that Jackson will ever hold court in
the Oval Office, he can still be of
service to his party. Jackson now has
enough public approval to be realis-
tically considered as a running mate
to the Democratic nominee. He has
shown that nonpartisan diplomacy
is the most effective means of inter-
national relations. It is regrettable
that we withhold such open-minded

are held hostage.

Jackson’s mission may have
benefitted his political hopes, but
ironically this Democratic candidate
has also aided President Reagan’s
re-election bid as well. Reagan
wants or needs to withdraw the
Marines from Lebanon. He can not
pull out without establishing some
plan for the security of Lebanon.

Thanks to Rev. Jackson, that obsta-

The outcome of this week‘s events
has aided Jesse Jackson and Ronald
Reagan. It is the hierarchy of the
Democratic party which has been
placed in the most precarious po, '
tion. Will they thank Jackson for
having the guts to do what they all
wanted to do, then try and push him
to the back burner, or will they show

Union CityiBIues/ Marty Willis

Each new year brings with it a new
set of resolutions. For I984, I
resolved to create a list of New
Year’s resolutions President Reagan
ought to make on behalf of the
country:

GTo implement without delay a
nationwide lie-detector policy for
Americans who try to get free food
from soup kitchens. If peole lie
about having nowhere else to eat,
they will be forced to spend one hour
listening to Edwin Meese.

GT0 undertake, in the name of

fairness and decency, a new civil
defense program that includes all

Americans, notjust the top political
and military leaders. The new slo-
gan: "A bomb shelter under every
home.“

Gin describe our nation’s enemies
more cvcnhandedly from now on,
no longer singling out the Soviet
Union as the sole focus of ‘‘evil’' in
the world. The new list ofevil places
should include Cuba. Nicaragua.
Berkeley, and Moscow (Idaho).

GT0 bring Richard Nixon back
into government as a presidential
adviser. Just last month. Nixon
released a book stating that Lenin
viewed Westerners who protested

the military policies oftheir govern-
ments as “useful idiots." Now that
Nixon has proven himself as an
author, he could move up a notch
and at Ieastmake himself useful.
GT0 break off diplomatic rela-
tions with Argentina immediately.
This has nothing to do with last
year‘s war over the Falklands. The
reason is that Argentina’s govern-
ment recently returned to civilian
control and announced that the gen-
erals and admirals who held state
power for the past eight years will be
held legally responsible for the fact
that about 20,000 citizens “disap-

It could be the caffeine, or it could
be the side effects of increased social
awareness brought on in courses
taught by a handful of cynical Pitt
professors. But for whatever reason,
I am plagued on those long, early
morning bus rides by questions. And
not ordinary ones.

While tucking away my bus pass
and digesting my daily diet of morn-
ing newspapers, 1 often feel com-

pelled to smile my I-used-to-be-dis-
gusted-but-now-l‘m-amused smile
and search the bus load of blank,
pasty faces for the answers.

Can someone please explain to me
why: '

One of President Ronald Rea-
gan’s priorities in the coming years is
to be able to “enter the 2Ist century
as a virile nation?"

People are more anxious to adopt
Cabbage Patch dolls than real
children?

The Pavlovian image of people
living behind the Iron curtain is that
of fat, cold individuals who wear fur
coats and look as if they’ve just
drunk lemon-ﬂavored ipecac?

Free cheese and butter for senior
citizens is considered a diet that will
tide them over indefinitely?

Government decisions support
moves to cut back foreign aid distri-
bution to Third World countries
while at the same time recommend
giving billions to Israel and Egypt,
which they will never have to pay
back?

Phyllis Schlafly can makea career
convincing other women they
should stay at home and not have a
career? And why her secretaries
should be paid less than truck driv-
ers because her secretaries can't

Primarily students in the humani-
ties have a terrible image of engi-
neering students, which usually
includes some nightmarish image
that they have the personality of
dishwater and wear plastic pen pro-

beach?

Official government statements
support the struggle of Solidarity,
but not the similar union moves tak-
ing place here?

Men now complain that they can't
raise entire families on minimum
wage, while women have been doing

it for years and most men never

think of calling that unfair?

The same persons who voted for
Reagan because they supported his
economic policies are now against
him because the budget cuts affected
everyone, not just the lower class?

As a country, we have cut back
drastically in our space program for
the usual budgetary reasons, but we
are prouder than ever of our ability
to fly around in space shuttles and
observe already known space?

The automatic explanation for
why the poor are poor is because
they don't work hard enough?

The immediate reaction to the
dawning of KAL 007 is to refuse to

GT0 write heartfelt letters of apol-
ogy to each of the officials who lost
his job when the president dissolved

the Civil Rights Commission a few _

months ago. As a postscript, he
could offer them some unemploy-
ment compensation, exceptthat
their eligibility period has already
run out.

GTO rethink the official policy
toward Central America which says
that nobody should be permitted to
“shoot their way into power.” The
new policy should be that no left-
wing Salvadorans may do so, but for
right-wing Nicaraguans it is no
problem. Reason: they may be
thugs, but at least they’re our thugs.

GT0 show the same courage this
year as he did in the presidential
campaign four years ago. That is, to
go into the South Bronx and tell
people that the minimum wage
should be lowered and that their
plight will improve.

olf he loses the election in
November, to make the following
promise to the American people, as
Jimmy Carter did in 1980: “I will
never again run for a political
office."

New SGB president

sets his priorities

By Ana Puga
The Pitt News

Student Government Board Pres-
ident Ken Stram said that continu-
ing work to re-establish the
internship office as promised during
the SGB campaign is one ofthe 1984
board‘s priorities.

Stram’s remarks came during the
swearing-in ceremonies, which were
held last night in the ballroom ofthe
William Pitt Union.

Stram said that the new board
must work to strengthen student
positions in the University Senate
committees, conduct a student
assembly that will give all student
organizations a voice and deal fairly
with the allocations process.

Last year's board, including out-
going president Mark Downs were
honored at the ceremonies on
Thursday.

Downs swore in Ken Stram, the
new 1984 president, who in turn
swore in the new board members.

Downs praised the 1983 SGB for
its work to increase student partici-
pation in student activities through
the student activities fair and its
lobby for the reopening of the stu-
dent internship office.

“This is the end of a year-long
effort to aid our fellow students,”
Downs said in’ his farewell address.

Dr. Conney M. Kimbo, vice-
chancellor for student affairs, said
the increased numbers of students
voting in the last election indicates
the increased importance of the stu-
dent government.

 

  

Mark Downs, former Student Government Board

president swore in Ken Stram last night at inaugural
ceremonies held in the William Pitt Union.

THE GARDEN OF ELOQUENCE
WILLARD R. ESPY

including portions of the original,
published in 1577 by Henry Peacham

Wlarper & Row

.03

Reviewing this book is quite similar
to reviewing an English class. This
book, however, was a great deal more
fun and far more educational than
any grammar lesson ever was. The
Garden of Eloquence presents an uni-
quely entertaining look at all of the
parts of speech, their uses and fun
examples.

The book is presented as a story,
told in the person, and occurs during
the main character's, afternoon nap.
Willard (the author and main charac-
ter) starts the story by investigating
his neighbor's supposedly vacant
house. When he exits the house, he is
no longer in Hometown, U.S.A.
Instead, he finds himself in the
garden of eloquence, where everyone
is an orator. He himself has been
magically transformed into Dandy
Lion I.

As Dandy Lion I, he. attends an
honors banquet where all the other
parts of speech are presented as
objects or animals of one kind or
another. These word/object relation-
ships make the various parts of
speech easier to recall.

The book continues on this way
and culminates in a great battle
between these "speech creatures" --
which are grammatical errors. Before
the war is won or lost, Dandy Lion I is
caught in a great wind and tumbles
back to the safety of Willard Espy's
lawn hammock. _ .

It is a shame, however, that with all
the knowledge found in this book,
there was no elaborate adjective for
"trivial," which describes its content.

TODD FRESHWATER

 

TAR

I By C.K. Williams

Random House

Everybody knows the kind of per-
son who, in the course of an evening's
conversation, reveals both the phen-
omenal extent of his memory and
perceptiveness and his lack of charm
by launching into long retellings of
certain events in his life. This kind of

, person goes beyond the usual "funny

the

you should mention it, a similar thing

happened to me..." that comprises.

most extended conversation. His sto-
ries are characterized, one, by their
relative emptiness of significance-
they are frequently about very trivial
matters, and two, by the degree of
perfect detail which the teller lends
his story. At first, we may be
impressed by his understanding of

_ detail, as he says, "it was one of those



cars, you know them, with a million
bumper stickers, ,a little rainbow on
the back window, ski rack on the roof,
an old rug thrown over the back seat,
the guy who drives it owns a chain of
waterbed stores, his wife runs a vege-
tarian restaurant that doubles as a

cocaine drop...," but as the story goes’

along, incredibly minutely and with
little in the way of development, we
find ourselves growing impatient,
and annoyed with the obvious relish
the teller takes in his control of detail.
Isn't everyfhing incredibly typical, he
ultimately seems to be saying...don't I

Willard Espy

understand it so well?

A poet, especially one who, like
C.K. Williams in his new book Tar,
writes in a conversational style, is
engaged in a kind of dialogue with his
reader. When the poet, as Williams, is
of the type described above, glibly
obsessed with his own past, remem-
bering it to us not so much for signifi-
cance as for effect. The result is a
book that causes impatience and
annoyance. Will the poet please shut‘
up for one moment?

Yet William's proud, excruciating,
fine-toothed—combing of his memory
is not his only tedious quality. His
sheer verbosity, the static, over-
growth of the lines of his poetry
(which the commentators whose
blurbs appear on the back of Tar com-
pare to everything from snakes to

cowboys to Cinemascope) are simply

torturous to read through beyond
the one— or two-poem limit. One
senses no more poetic control here
than in the most ugly, snaggle—
toothed passage of Kerouac.

William's intention seems to be to
use language to fully encompass
experience, enumerating things, and
shoring together all the bits of the
world he can fit into the space of a
poem. The desire to (here I quote the
blurb contributed to the back cover
by Robert Pinsky) "quest after the
entirety of life" is absurd.

One poem is successful, "Walking
Jed." Here, the obsessive thorough-
ness with which a father watches his
son wake, detailing all of his facial and
body changes, seems to fit with the
notion of a good father's concern

' A with andminterest in the behaviorof

his children. The poem recalls a sim-
ilar, similarly touching episode in The
World According to Garp.

One lacks, in poems such as "Tar"
and "Soon," the kind of unity that
lends the ending of a poem its irony,
its kick, its sense of compact effect.
An open—ended story, whether in

prose or in verse, can give the reader
a feeling of tension or of emotional
spookiness, but this is a delicate

effect, and a whole book of such sto--

ries is a mess.

SANDRO OF CHECEM
By Fazil lskander
Vintage

Author Fazil lskander introduces
the idea that "man ennobles what he
loves," and Sandra of Chegem is a repres-
entation of what lskander himself
ennobles. This collection of 11 tales
revolves around an 80-year-old "tam-
ada" (leader) and his Abkhazian vil-
lage of Chegem.

The stories and characters concern
themselves with the customs and
superstitions of these people living in
the Russian Caucuses from the 18805
to the 1960s. U,ncle Sandro, who is the
toastmaster of the village, heads the
table and by nature, is a skillfull
speaker, master of ritual and expert
in human nature. He is expected to
outdrink and outshow any foreigner.
An expectation he gladly fulfills.

The tales show the peasant mental-
ity in terms of modernization and the
influence of Soviet annexation on
their little nation. For example, the
narrator questions Uncle Sandro’s
refusal to believe such "lies" and his
willingness to believe in the Abomi-
nable Snowman.

For the humanistic qualities of the
tales, one needs only to think of the
fables and legends we heard as a child.
To understand the deep satire of his-

torical events snd criticisms of the j_ 7

Soviet takeover, the reader needs a
further understanding beyond the
historical outline in the back of the
book.

A main problem with the approach
lskander takes is that much of the
flavor of the oral tradition is lost as

BOOK ‘EM D

the author attempts to refine the
tales according to the traditions of
the printed work. He is caught
between the need to refine and his
desire to retain the flavorable lan-
guage of the oral tradition. K
Overall, the tales were delightful,
but the technical difficulties seemed
to make them drag. Sandro of Chegem
seems more like a classroom assign-
ment, rather than a leisure activity.

THE OFFICIAL COUCH POTATO
HANDBOOK
By Iack Mingo, Illustrated By Robert
Armstrong
Capra Press

Answer a few questions, please:

OAre moments spent in front ofthe
tube some of your fondest childhood
memories?

CD0 the people in the TV seem
more real to you than your friends or
family?

CD0 you fib about how much tele-
vision you watch?

0Are you the only person you
know who can sing the entire Gilligan's
Island theme song?

If you answered ”yes" to one or
more of the questions, you are a
potential couch potato, a breed of
human spud that proudly declares
that prolonged television viewing is a
way of life. Like women, gays and
other stigmatized groups, couch
potatos are finally coming out of the
closet, and the first step towards

their liberation is the publication of

this handbook. -

The Official Couch Potato Handbook is
divided into several chapters, which
cover every angle involved in being a
couch potato. It gives you the unsung
heros of the couch potatoes, etiquette
for the couch potato, TV cuisine
(know how the make a coffee crystal
sandwich.7), and sex (couch potatoes
don't do it — they'd rather watch),
how to tone up while tuning in, the
history of the couch potato and more.

This book would make the perfect
gift for just about anybody but is
especially for the over—educated art-
lover who lives next door and claims
to watch only PBS on a small black
and white set — he's lying and you
know it, so maybe if you give him this
book, he'll come out of the closet, too.

The Pitt News, Friday, January 6, I984.

 

By MARK MARTINI

A quick glance at the marquee out-
side of any theater showing D.C. Cab
will tell you that the film stars Mr. T
and Irene Cara, but two of the biggest
roles really belong to two of Holly-
wood's lesser-known names, Adam
Baldwin and Charlie Barnett. The
two were in Pittsburgh recently, tak-
ing part in a 10-state promotional
tour for the movie. I‘

A few hawk-eyed moviegoers
might recognize Adam Baldwin from
his previous screen roles: the title
part in My Bodyguard, one of Timothy
Hutton's friends in Ordinary People and
a starring role in Reckless. On the
other hand, D.C. Cab marks Charlie
Barnett’s screen debut. The 28-year-
old black comedian hails from the
Bronx, where he was a successful
street comic. From there, he moved
on to top comedy clubs in New York
and throughout the country and was
one of the three rising comedians fea-
tured in HBO's "Young Comedians”
special.

D.C. Cab is the story of a flounder-
ing cab company in the nation's
capitol. The colorful group of drivers
it employs includes Gary Busey (The
Buddy Holly Story), Mr. T and comedi-

V ans Bill Maher, Paul Rodriguez and

Charlie Barnett. Adam Baldwin plays
Albert, whose late father was a war
buddy of D.C. Cab’s owner, played by
Max Gail (Barney Miller). After his
father's death, Albert moves in with
his father's friend, becomes the new-
est D.C. cabbie and turns the com-
pany around with his offbeat ideas.

Both Baldwin and Barnett felt very
comfortable with their roles. Baldwin
describes the role of Albert as "an
external role" as opposed to the
"internal role" he had in My Bodyguard,
adding that "it was my best expe-
rience since.”

Barnett has difficulty describing
his role as Tyrone Bywater, a shifty
cab driver who wears a wig so people
will think he's crazy and charges
naive customers $195 for a $12 dollar
ride from the airport ("They had a lot
of luggage.").

"Tyrone is like a lot of black guys —
angry at the ghetto because of the

V, shit they go through — who got it

together, then fucked up again and
went back; but all the time, he had it
more together than people thought,”
Barnett explains. "And nobody could
bring him around until he met Albert.
...At these interviews, I've ‘had a hard
time explaining him."

"You want me to explain him?"
Baldwin asks.

”Yeah, give me something to say to
the reporters in the next 10 states,”
Barnett quips. I

"Tyrone is someone who doesn't

believe that the system deserves an ’

intelligent, smart black man,” says
Baldwin. "The system as it's set up
just deserves another crazy...."
"Dumb-assed nigger," says Bar-
nett, filling the pause with a quote of
Tyrone's from the movie. "OK, that's
what I'll say. All I can tell you is that I
had fun doing him. I could play the

ﬂ Tyrone Bywater that could change
direction, wearing a suit jacket one

minute and that crazy’ wig the

 'nex,t....I,, could, play the two people »

\v.~.~uu7«._\‘v-tcwy

five minutes after I get paid....So to
play Tyrone was really me. I think
everybody was really close to their
role in the movie, especially me. It's a
fun movie."

"The two fun movies out are going
to_ be ,D.C.Cab and Scarface," says
Baldwin.

But Barnett disagrees. "The two

fun movies are going to be D.C. Cab,

and the sequel to D.C.Cab."
"Which will be out two weeks
later," adds Baldwin. "AC/DC Cab."
"Yeah," says Barnett, "me and
Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie."
Barnett says that he was "disco-
vered" for the role of Tyrone by Dee
D. Wiehl, a casting director at Uni-

    
 

Adam Baldwin is one of the stars of D.C. Cab

versal. She went to see one of his
street comedy shows in Washington
Square (all of which were being
attended at the time by up to 400
people) on the advice of a comedy
teacher at the New York School for
the Performing Arts, who described
Barnett as ”the funniest guy I ever
saw."

As Barnett tells it, "She came to the
park, and after a show one day, she
gave me her card and said, ‘I'm from
Universal Studios; would you be
interested in doing a movie?’ I said
'Yeah,' and started shining her shoes
and shit."

Barnett was also offered to audi-
tion for the position now occupied by
Eddie Murphy on "Saturday Night
Live" but declined because of what he
calls "a reading problem." At the
mention of Murphy's name, Barnett
explodes into fake convulsions.

"Eddie’s mad at me," Barnett
explains, referring to an article in Peo-
ple magazine in which Barnett said

that he is "jealous" of Murphy. -"I 

have some friends...thatiwe1j,e at this

,club that Eddie;»’wasla“t in New  -

over and sat with them, and one or
them said, 'Yeah, this attorney friend
of mine happens to manage a fella by
the name of Charlie Barnett,’ and
Eddie started yelling, 'He's always
talking about me, he's always talking
about me! I'm gonna have to hold a
press conference and deal with him.’ "

But Barnett plans to use the anim-
osity between them to his advantage.
"I have nothing against Eddie
Murphy. My reading problem is not
Eddie Murphy's fault. I don't hate
Eddie. I am jealous 'cause it could
have been me —— I will admit that. I
couldn't watch ‘Saturday Night Live’
or 48 Hrs. But I figure if I have a
reading problem and I made it this

far, how's he gonna stop me? If I learn
to read, I may become President.
Look at Jesse Jackson. Blacks are run-
ning — they're running for some-

'thing now, not from," he says,

throwing in the usual joke.

"So the deal is, I give him 48 Hrs. to

I get out of Hollywood 'cause we're

Trading Places....If he wants to chal-
lenge me to a comedy duel and call a
press conference, he's only helping
my career; 'cause I will be there six
months early waiting for him....I'm
not afraid of him — I worked with
him before he made it....And he bet-
ter not come dressed as Gumby,
either.”

Barnett’s plans for the immediate
future deal mostly with the more
serious aspects of the business:
"stand-up, tours, movies, white

‘women and an occasional water-

melon - a man's gotta eat," Barnett
jokes. "My next movie's gonna be a
version of Roots. We're gonna do it
backwards so it will have a ‘happy
en_ding....Th,ere was some comedy. in

should be just as easy as that of”

tTyrone Bywater, because the movie

is about "comedy and the changes
comedians go through between try-
ing to make it and actually making it,"
he explains. "The ones who make it
are the ones that have no other
income and no intentions of doing
anything but comedy....I don't have
no choice....It was either comedy or
poordom. It was an easy choice."

Baldwin, whose only acting expe-
rience before My Bodyguard was high
school theater, has no immediate
future plans. "I haven't seen anything
worth lining up," he explains. "I'd like
to play just a regular, ordinary guy. I
think they're the most-interesting
characters. The guy that has some
scam that he thinks is gonna work,
like Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. He's
more interesting because there's less
tendency to glorify him....I think that
people are very interested in seeing
just a regular person because that's
who they know, that's who they
work with, that's who they're mar-
ried to, and they recognize them-
selves in that.”

Baldwin says he "is still developing
himself" and is currently studying
acting under Roy London. ”I like to
think of myself as an aspiring magi-
cian; so when I finally come to com-

' prehend [London's] entire technique,

I will be able to make magic at any-
time for anyone just by turning it on
and becoming a character."

Baldwin calls his D.C. Cab role as
Albert "the only serious role in the
movie" but adds that "you have to
have someone to keep the reality
going because if you only have crazy
people, the audience has trouble
relating to it."

, Just as Baldwin draws on real life
for his acting, Barnett uses real life
observations for his comedy material.
”I see things and make them funny,"
he explains. "I saw Roots.... I see people
going to work, I see tourists....An air-
port makes me laugh....We sit here
and everytime we say something
funny, that's a joke that we justlet go

up in smoke. When I'm coming up’

with new material, I have a‘ tape
recorder in my pocket, and every time
we say something funny, I repeat the
premise of it on tape. Then I go home
and listen to it....The slickest way to
come up with new material is to go
onstage cold turkey and not do your
act but everything you've got that's
new. So the pressure on you to be
funny with that new stuff is so great
that either you go down and bomb or
you make at least one joke funny. It's
the hardest and the best way to come

{)2

we

up with new jokes....Ten minutes A

without a laugh is a long time."
For the relatively short time that
both Barnett and Baldwin have been

‘ in show business, they both seem sat-

isfied with the way their careers are
moving. "It’s not happening too fast,"
Baldwin says, "but I'm not looking for
fame. Charlie's looking for fame.”
”I’m looking for anything that'll get

me out of the Bronx....," Barnett says. a

"People ask me, «’Being out of they

A SUSAN SONTAG READER
By Susan Sontag
Vintage

Susan Sontag’s essays are like
great works of fiction, because they
are not simply criticism by imagina-
tive writing. Sontag writes about the
world, but in terms of its ideas and
artists —- not by constructing Charac-
ters and plots. Sontag selects her top-
ics carefully and follows her
pronounced tastes; this is the distinc-
tion that makes her work so impor-
tant. She embraces her material (the
filmmaker, books, writers, ideas etc.)
as a novelist hoards snatches of
conversations.

A Susan Sontag Reader is simply fine
writing. Like other major authors,
her writings clearly express the voice
of Susan Sontag; her intelligence, her
thinking, her beliefs, her enthusiasm,
her aesthetics. It includes some of her
most impressive essays: "On Style,"
"Notes on Camp," ”The Aesthetics of
Silence," ”Against Interpretation,” an
excerpt from her book On Photography,
excerpts from each of her two novels
Death Kit and The Benefactor, two short

a ' fictions and an interview with

Sontag.

In ”Against Interpretation,” she
writes:

"Today is such a time, when the project of
interpretation is largely reactionary, stifling.
Like the fumes of the automobile and heavy
industry which befoul the urban atmosphere,
the effusion of interpretations of art today
poisons our sensibilities."

This statement represents the
main point of her writing; she wishes
not to give her own interpretation of

things but to think about art, and
then art criticism, as an artist. Her
writing does not suggest limited
interpretations of art, but rather sug-
gests possible new meanings, re-
viewings. She is always careful never
to categorize art, to tell what some-
thing ”means"; rather, she tells how
things work.

Her essays are often more absorb-
ing than the actual event they dis-

cuss, because Sontag is such a _

passionate thinker that she takes pos-
sesion of her topics and makes them
her own creation.

Sontag’s fiction is not as admirable
as her essays. A Sontag essay sent-
ence is recognizable. It has a certain
rhythm, a sharpness and complexity.

It is this type of writing, this per-
fect clarity, that devalues her fiction.
Her material, characters, scenes are

diverting, but one feels that hiddeIC

slightly beneath the narrative voice
of her fictionis a Sontag essay that
could masterfully cut to the center of
the matter.

Overall the book is an impressive
summary of her work. Her essays
think exuberantly, her fiction probes
and meditiates, and the end result of
her writing casts a remarkably clear
shadow of her mind. It is recom-
mended to all who have not disco-
vered Sontag. i

ION ARMSTRONG

 
TI‘-IE SACRIFICE
By Frank Bidart
Random House

William Blake viewed the Crucifix-
ion as the principal event in human

history; The Sacrifice, Frank Bidart’s
most recent collection of poetry, con-
cerns itself subtly, overtly, almost
entirely, with manifestations of that
incident. The people who feel thems-
leves compelled to shoulder the
burden of the world or who grapple
with this feeling but are unable to
make that ultimate sacrifice, are here
not Christs but I nameless sons,
friends of the poet, the dancer
Nijinsky.

The longest poem in this rather
slim volume, ”The War of Vaslav Nij—
insky," is the most remarkable. It
explores the themes of guilt and expi-
ation as they become apparent to, and
then obsess Nijinsky in the last years
of his life. The poem is predominantly
narrated by the dancer himself, in an
elegant, simple, convincing voice that
doubts, praises, scorns and condemns
itself. At times Nijinsky sounds mad,
as indeed, he was historically diag-
nosed; however, the dangers that
might befall such an ”insane" mono-
logue -— repetiveness, incomprehen-
sibility -9 are absent.

The other poems in the book tread
similar ground, though on less epic a
scale. Two of them, ”For Mary Ann
Youngren" and ”The Sacrifice," deal
with the deaths of friends of the poet.
These poems are not elegies; Bidart’s
method is to distance himself from
his subjects, avoiding a confessional
tone, fitting all experience onto his
remote, huge framework of guilt and
redemption. In ”For Mary Ann
Youngren," a woman dying of cancer
seeks both someone to take responsi-
bility for her death and someone to
recognize its significance, the lifetime
of solitary suffering that led up to it.

 

"The Sacrifice,” perhaps blasphem-

y ously and certainly a little unconvinc-

ingly, elevates the bitter suicide of a

woman to a station higher than that _

of Christ's murder. The suicide is the
greater sacrifice, Bidart tells us,
because it was made without the
assistance — the strange comfort -
of a Judas.

Almost as an antidote to the
preceding catalogue of crucifixions,
Bidart offers the last poem in the
book, a retelling of the first and part
of the second chapters of Genesis.
Following very closely the story of
Creation as it is narrated in the King
James Version, Bidart strips down
the tale, reducing it to the essentials.
The spare, muted, yet positive tone of
the last poem in the book states the
perpetual certainty that the Creation
of the World, despite its sorry conse-
quences, was not a mistake. A

Two minor objections: Bidart uses
a curious device, the setting of words
in capitals and/or italics, the reading
of which can be as annoying as with
those apparently randomly italicized
words in the Bible; and second,
Bidart’s retelling of Genesis offers a
whiff of vegetarianism that seems
somehow frivolous, no matter how
noble his intention. The Sacrifice suc-
ceeds by virtue of its simple, tightly
coiled language and the clarity with
which Bidart has perceived the cen-
tral problem of the book. We are
shown the most metaphysical aspects
of the question of sacrifice without
ever losing the thread of the poem;
and ”Nijinsky" is a fascinating por-
trait as well as a strong act of poetry.

SEVEN AND THE RAGGED
TIGER

Duran Duran

Capitol

MTV’s philosophy of "seeing
the music” has made success
stories of many artists who oth-
erwise might not have cracked
the elusive popular music
charts. Two prime examples are
Billy Idol and Duran Duran.
While both may have garnered a
certain amount of success with-
out the visuals, it is extremely
doubtful that the waves they've
each created would have been so
powerful without the videos
and MTV’s backing.

Video killed the radio star and
created a whole new contingent

SOUL INSIDE
Soft Cell
Sire

A swan song, apparently,
from the Marc AlmondlDavid
Ball duo who call themselves
Soft Cell: So_ul Inside, a five-cut
album (although the tracks add
up nicely to 38 and one-half
minutes). A dark collection in
terms of themes and approach,
the disc still showcases the
pair's trademarks — Almond's
well-oiled voice sliding expertly

Right Stuff; Wrong Med

of rocksters who may not have
all their musical muscles in
shape but who look good in

' front of the camera. But, look-

ing good doesn't always a musi-
cian make....

Seven And The Ragged Tiger is a
disappointment for fans of DD
who remember "Planet Earth”
when it was called New Roman-
tic music. As their third album,
this release should catch them
just as they're finally hitting
their stride; instead, it captures
them as they're falling and trip-
ping about all over their vinyl
confinements.

It's said you can't argue with
success, but so help me, if the
fact that "Union of the Snake"
hit No. 3 last week means it's
good, then I'll give away my
record collection and take up
chantin in Buda est. The rest

over and through Ball's shim-
mering, electronic wall of
orchestration and a hint of pret-
ension and self-indulgence.

The title track, an impassi-
oned primal scream clocking in
at 11:59, just barely manages to
avoid the‘"too much" mark. "It's
a wild celebration of feelings
inside," Almond cries of his soul
inside, "and it's tearing me
apart" — a harrowing, ironic
breakdown strapped to music
("the extra trauma hysteria
mix," according to the album
cover).

"You Only Live Twice" is
James Bond's O07 theme, neatly
executed with a heavy dose of
foreboding, courtesy of Mr.
Ball's almost religious key-
boards. "Numbers," another
long track (a short version
appeared on their Art of Falling
Apart album), laments dehu-
manization with inspired, slow
monotony: "names make the
present real" and uncomforta-

. ble; but numbers provide dis-
. tance. "Barriers" offers more

pessimism, and "Her Imagina-

‘ tion"lis downright eerie para-

noia, outlined by Almond and
supported by Ball's spare
instrumentation.

There's not even a hint of the
lightweight froth of "Tainted

 

DURAN DURAN

of the record sounds about the
same, and while Simon Le Bon's
voice is as strong as ever, even
he can't rescue us from the
murky shallowness of the LP's
lyrics.

Le Bon sings passionately
about a variety of subjects —
reflexes, new moons, telegram
force, hands of the night —
none of which make any sense
at all. But then, neither does the
album title, so I guess that's par
for the course.

Billy Idol, he of the amazing
stand-up hair and the_arm that
won't stay down, fares much
better with his latest, Rebel Yell.
You can probably chalk that up
to experience; he's been going
strong since the mid-'70s when
he started Chelsea, broke
through in England with Gen-
eration X and, three albums

.Love," "Where Did Our Love
Go" or "What" here. Soul Inside
refines Soft Cell's approach —
truly depressing sentiments
buoyed by the "new wave" style
—— into an intriguing paradox:
entertaining angst.

RICHARD SATER

GIRL’S NIGHT OUT
Toronto
MCA

Toronto has to its credit four
platinum Canadian albums and
the equivalent of a Grammy
nomination. Lead singer Holly
Woods was voted Best Female
Vocalist by a group of musical
contemporaries. This can be
attributed to the same logic that
admits ABBA is internationally
‘the most successful group in
history, beating out the Beatles.

It's funny, then, that the big-
gest hit on the album, "All I
Need," is also the only song on

. which the allegedly illustrious

Woods doesn't sing lead. It's also
the only one that isn't written
by any group member. That just
goes to prove there's a definite
cultural line between the US.
and the rest of the world: Amer-
ica went for the tune that's
probably the least representa-
tive of Toronto's worl<.. ,

later, moved to America and
went solo.

Idol's hard-core look and
manner aside, he's one of the
very few New Music artists
who has the solid background
and musical common sense to
carry him past this year's
trends. The title track is about
as raucous as he gets, and even
then, it's perfectly controlled
and, therefore, perfectly accep-
table for playlists of all kinds.

The majority of Rebel Yell, in
contrast to Idol's killer-albino-
image and post-punk flashiness,
is in fact built upon the main-
stream idiom, but there are
enough rough edges thrown in
to make it ”cool" to listen to.

Idol could tone down the
leather togs and leave the
metal-studded wristbands at
home, and God knows, he ought
to take a rest from his domina-
tion of MTV, but as long as he
proves he's got more substance
than his hollow-bodied video
peers, he can do anything he
damn well pleases in my book.

Over," in which the band's two
women (the principal members)
proclaim in inventive harmony
that it's "just one step over the
line." This is the only thing that
comes close to the witty, musi-
cal wordplay that so easily
catches attention.

Most of the remaining songs
are a little too simple, each
chanting the same refrain —
Oh, why are you with that
other girl? Oh, you should be
with me, etc., etc. The music is
missing a certain brush of guts
that would distinguish if from
pure top 40 material.

It's conceivable that Toronto
could build up a minor follwoing
in the U.S., but their Canadian
super—stardom just won't make

‘it through customs. They'll

remain one of those bands that
pop out one worthy, danceable

‘ single that fades quickly and is

forgotten just as fast. Maybe in
a few years, they'll come up
with another cut that sparks the
American interest, but any suc-
cess more frequent than that is
a hope too high.

' advanced enough, but his lyrics

 

SWEET SOUND
Simon Townshend
21/Polygram

Ignore the fact that Simon
Townshend is Pete's younger
(by 18years) brother? Impossi-
ble. Disregard the line of print
on the back of the album cover
that says "Produced by Pete
Townshend"? Never. Breeze
over Simon's uncanny vocal
similarity to his older sibling?
Not a chance. Spell nepotism?
No sweat.

Make no bones about it —
Simon Townshend's debut
album sounds a lot like his
brother's music. Moreover,
with Big Brother O'Riley pro-
ducing, the resemblance is even
sharper. However, upon closer
examination, Simon seems to
possess more of his brother's
style than his substance. In
other words, he can write a
decent pop song, but he'll proba
bly never produce anything as
brilliant as "Baba O'Riley" or
even "Slit Skirt," even after 30
or 40 years of experience
(Which is also true of about 80
percent of the musicians in
today's business.).

While Sweet Sound is a better-
than-average debut for the
younger Townshend, it is a vic-
tim of the artist's inexperience
which, in this case, is a true dis-
advantage since Simon can be so
easily compared to Pete (at least
in style). Simon's guitar work is

suffer from a vagueness and
immaturity that his brother
never seemed to have. Still,
Sweet Sound's pop accessibility
gives it an added advantage,
especially with "On The Scaf-
folding," "Palace In The Air,"
the title tune, and ”I'm The
Answer," which sounds like an
out—take from Empty Glass.

In addition, Pete Town-
shend's production makes this
play like one of his own solo pro-
jects- Big brother has Simon's
guitars miked up front and
keeps the bass, keyboards, sax,
and drums (by Big Country's
Mark Brzezicki) as subtler back-
ground atmosphere. This, while

 

  
        
 

it sounds great, only serves to
heighten the artistical homoge-
neity of the Townshend
brothers.

The bottom line is that Simon
Townshend has made one hel-
luva career move: Sweet Sound,
instead of establishing him as an
artist in his own right, only
seems to magnify Simon Town-
shend's musical resemblance to
his older sibling. This might
help with record sales, but it's
also going to force him to live in
the shadow of one of rock's
most accomplished legends——
his own brother.

2 X 2
Blue Zoo
RCA

Yup. An-other young British
quartet, aiming for America's
pop music jugular, makes the
trans-Atlantic jump. They call
themselves Blue Zoo and their
album 2 X 2. Indiscriminate
acceptance of all imported music
might be the trend, but it's time
for the U.S. to exercise
discretion. .

Frontman Andy 0 provides
the distracting and irksome lead
vocals with no consistent style.
Bassist Mike Ansell, percus-
sionist Michael Arthur Sparrow
and guitarist Tim Parry provide
shrill backing vocals and undis-
tinguished accompaniment
with few sparks of originality.
Several guests contribute, but 2
X .2 offers nothing new and does
little with the old parts.

The foursome pens its own
material. That "Cry Boy Cry"
and "I'm Your Man" and "Love
Moves in Strange Ways"
attracted attention in England's
dance halls fuels the fire sup-
porting the notion that anyone
can have a club hit. Dancers
require only a steady beat with a
bit of music wrapped around it.

Blue Zoo stabs at white funk-
/pop, but as one of their songs —
”Open Up" -— asks, "What is the
meaning/the meaning of this?"
Or the point? 2 X 2 isn't good or
bad; it's simply generic. _

Friday, January 6, 1984

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Sophomore guard Bryan Mit-
chell said yesterday that he is
“definitely leaving" the Pitt bas-
ketball program because he
believes that Coach Roy Chip-
man has not given him a fair
chance.

Chipman was unavailable for
comment due to the fact that he
was in Bridgeport, Conn., sign-
ing a recruit by the name of Cha-
rles Smith.

Mitchell was outspoken in his
disappointment.

“I’m leaving because I know
I’m being treated unfairly,” Mit-
chell said yesterday. “I don‘t con-
sider any of the other guards as
better than me. I know I‘m capa-
ble of doing things that the other
guards can‘t.“

In the Pitt media guide, Mit-
chell is said to be “probably the

best athlete in the Panther
backcourt.”
As a senior at Lexington

Catholic High School, the 6-4,
195 pounder was one of the top
I0 players in the state of Ken-
tucky. He was an honorable
mention selection on the Con-
verse All-America team, and he
chose Pitt over several major col-
lege programs.

“I could have gone to Purdue,
South Florida or Louisville," he
said. “I saw Pitt was going to the
Big East. I thought they were
making a move up, and I wanted
to be a part of that."

At the end of the I982-83 sea-
son, Mitchell was considering
transferring but decided to stay
because he played a lot against
St. John's in the season finale
and was a member of the 4xl00-
meter relay team that set a Pitt
track record.

Frustration

Mitchell leaves Pitt

 
 

«‘I’m leaving because I

know I’m being

treated unfairly.‘
--Bryan Mitchell

“I was able to understand not
playing a little more last season,”
he said. “I was a freshman, and I
had a little trouble adjusting to
college. This year, I don‘t have
those problems.

“I believe I've done enough to
deserve playing time, and if I
can’t get it here, then I have to go
somewhere else."

Although he has not decided
where he wishes to continue his
career, Mitchell will visit Tampa,
Fla., and the University ofSouth
Florida.

“I want to leave as soon as pos-
sible because I still have a chance
of becoming eligible in January
of 1985. lfl wait till the end ofthe
year then I won‘t be eligible until
the fall of I985."

Mitchell has suited up for nine
of the first [0 games, he didn‘t
make the trip to Boston College.
Mitchell appeared in five games
and played a total of2l minutes.
He has scored l3 points.

Against Indiana, he turned in
what may turn out to be the sea-
son’s most dynamic play. On a
fast break, Mitchell faced one
Indiana defender and, without
any hesitation, went over the
defender in classic Julius Erving
style to deliver a slam dunk that
rocked the 4,713 in attendance at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“Though I had only little play-
ing time this season, I still

  
  

J‘

.  1
Dave armene/ or

Bryan Mitchell

thought I was doing everything
that he [Chipman] wanted."

Frustration has hit in such
major proportions that Mitchell
can no longer remain at Pitt and
be happy. If he is unable to find a
place in the immediate future, he
will continue with his studies and
run indoor as well as outdoor
track here at Pitt.

The Pitt Athletic Administra-
tion has said that it has no inten-
tion of revoking his scholarship._

The effects of his decision will
became apparent in time.

“I hope that I don‘t come back
to haunt Pitt,” he said. “But I
have to do what’s best for me.”

Pitt signs 6-9 skyscraper,
touted ‘best in the East’

Renaissance II has spread into
Oakland; a skyscraper has been

Charles Smith, a 6-9, 210-lb. cen-
ter from Bridgeport, Conn., signed a
national letter ofintent with Pitt yes-
terday afternoon. Eugene “Junie”
Lewis, a 6-2 guard from Philadel-
phia averaging 29 points per game,
was also signed.

Smith is regarded by many as the
outstanding schoolboy in the East.
USA Today touted him as one ofthe
top five high school players who
didn’t sign during the early recruit-

Pitt coach Roy Chipman was
ecstatic about the signing, which

reinforces his commitment to the
future.

“This is a great, great signing for
us," he said. “With Charles, Junie
Lewis, Marlon Ferguson and Curtis

young players in the last two years

Eagles overcome

Panther charge,

Vaughan,

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

On the strength of 79.l percent
shooting in the second half, the Bos-
ton College Eagles (9-2) held off
their game guests, the Pitt Panthers
(8-2), 81-77 in Monday night’s Big
East opener.

The Roberts Center crowd of
4,000 watched an offensive show-
down as Clyde Vaughan of Pitt
poured in 37 points and the Eagles’
tandom of tiny guard (5-8) Michael
Adams and lanky forward (6-l l).Iay
Murphy combined for 49.

In the first five minutes the Eagles
reiterated to the Panthers that this is
the Big East, as Pitt fell behind by
10, 14-4. .

Down by I0 and on the road, the
Panthers never gave up, clawing
back to tie the score at 30-30 on a
Clyde Vaughan rebound shot with
l:l5 to go in the half.

“That‘s a very tough place to play,
and we had trouble putting the ball
in the hoop at the start,"sophomore
guard Joey David explained. “After
getting intto the flow of the game, we
played them tough."

Pitt entered the second half trail-
ing by two, 32-30.

After a Keith Armstrong lay-up
that knotted the score, Boston Col-
lege reeled off eight straight. I

The Panthers came back again to
cut the lead to four, 42-38, on
another Armstrong layup. Arm-

missed both on a two-shot foul.

Meanwhile, the Eagles hit two
straight buckets, and the lead went
back to eight, 48-40.

Vaughan hit a three-point play,
and Chip Watkins followed with a
lay-up and the Panthers trailed by
only three.

After trading baskets for a while,
Boston College prepared to widen
its lead. And do so they did. With
8:02 remaining in the contest, the
Panthers were down by 11, 64-53.

Once again, they were able to
regroup. Panther freshman guard
Curtis Aiken cut the Eagles‘ adyan-
tage to six, 75-69 with 2: I8 remain-
ing, on a l,5—-foot jump shot. After
the Eagles’ Roger McCready hit
both ends of his one-and-one,
Vaughan hit a I2-foot jump shot.

Dominic Pressley answered for
the Eagles with a lay-up. The Pan-
thers called timeout with l:03 left
after Vaughan forced in a two-foot
jumper.

The score was 79-73, and the,

Panthers were without the ball.

Pitt‘s Billy Culbertson fouled‘

Adams, and he missed the foul shot.
With :25 left, the Panthers went to
Watkins, who came through with a
crucial three-poinit play, cutting the
lead to three. Aiken fouled Pressley
with 22 seconds left, and he missed
the free throw. Pitt came to the fore-
court, and Murphy fouled Vaughan
with :l l. Pitt called a timeout.
Vaughan made the first, and the

Wrestlers
try to get
a hold of
Penguins

   

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

The Panther wrestling team be-
gins its I984 season with a trip to
Youngstown, Ohio, to take on the
Penguins of YSU tonight at 7:30
p.m. V
The Panthers are currently 1-0
after stomping Waynesburg College
32-6 on Nov. 30.

“We’re going to use this match as
a tune—up for the second semester,"
said assistant coach Chuck Coryea,
“but last year, although the team
score wasn’t that close, they fought
us hard at a couple weights and won
four matches.

“We went in flat; we can’t let that
happen this year.”

With starter Gary Snyder out of
the lineup at ll8 lbs., sophomore
Bob Pisone (0-1) will get the nod
against Youngstown’s Todd Waters.

Although Pesone lacks varsity
experience, Coryea said, “Bob is
aggressive and wants to win. This is
his first year out, but we‘re not afraid
to put him on the mats.”

At 126 lbs., sophomore Kyle Nel-
lis (I3-4) will get the start against
Dom Mancini of YSU.

Nellis enters tonight’s contest
fresh off a second-place showing at
the Wilks Open Tournament on
Dec. 30, losing in the finals to
Bloomsburg’s Rocky Bonomo.

Panther co-captain Joe Th"rock-
morton (IO-2) will attempt to up his
record when he meets Penguin Ron
Thomas at I34 lbs.

At I42 lbs., sophomore Gary
Bolin (2-3) will take on YSU’s
Mohamoud Fard, while Panther
Joe Bond (IO-7) will see action

against Youngstown’s Mike
Schlueter.
At I58 lbs., Panther Sherm

Moyer (I-4) will try to get his season
back on track with a win over YSU‘s
Mike l-liem.

The only battle Panther co-
captain Jeff Jelic (12-l) will have
tonight is making weights. ‘as
Youngstown will hand him a forfeit
at I68 lbs.

Sophomore Jack Uppling (4-4) of
Pitt will be trying for a winning
record, but he will be facing one of
YSU’s tougher grapplers, Aquilino
Hiem, at I77 lbs.

Panther freshman Curtis Conner
(2-2) will battle Tim Trepa at I90
lbs., while the only rematch of the
evening will be at heavyweight with
Pitt senior Dan Kasperkoski (1-2)
out to avenge last year’s loss to
YSU’s Rich Bruno.

“Overall, we really can‘t expect a
very strong match,” said Coryea of
Youngstown’s wrestling, “but we
won‘t be able to just go out on the
mat and expect them to fall down.
We found that out last year.

“We’re going to have to be pre-
pared. We‘ll be up for the match
because nobody wants to be the only
one to lose.”

and the Eagles picked up the
rebound, passed the length of the
court to Terence Talley, who laid in
the final shot, and the game was
history. -

“We’re not discouraged,” Pitt
coach Roy Chipman said. “We
played the second best team in the
Big East on their home court and
came out 8|-77. They shot over 75
percent in the second half and beat
us by only two. When they come to

may be on the other foot.”

The Panthers far and away outre-
bounded the Eagles, 36-25, but it
almost never came into play because
Boston College almost never needed
a second shot.

“We wanted to prove that. we
could control the boards," Watkins
said. “They just shot so well."

“We fought very hard,” Chipman
said. “The only thing disappointing
is that the two [Murphy and Adams]
we wanted to take out of the game
played great.~We told our kids not to
foul them."

Chipman specifically noted the ‘
play of Aiken.

“He's a Big East-type player. We
only got four points out of our start-
ing guards [George Allen and Cul-
bertson], and [Billy [Culbertson]
didn't score a point. They had an off
night, but you’re gonna see more
and more of Aiken.”

Chipman also said that he was
pleased with the team’s ability to
play man-to-man with the Eagles.

In reference to this Saturday's Big
East home opener, when the Pan-
thers play host to Earl Kelley and the
Huskies of Connecticut at I2 p.m. in
the Big East game-of-the-week,
Chipman is looking toward a much
improved UConn squad.

Pitt gets a kick...-.

    
   
   
   
    
 

The Student Government Academic Affairs
Committee is holding a Book Exchange  

The Pitt football team solved its placekicking woes by signing Mark
Brasco of Jeanette High School to a institutional letter of intent.

In his high school career, Brasco kicked 25 of 44 field goals, break-
ing the Pennsylvania high school record of 19, held by Carson Long,
who was a placekicker for Pitt from 1973-76.

In 1983, he kicked nine field goals, including a 46—yarder, the
longest in his career.

Date: Monday, Jan. 9th &

Even when Pitt and Penn State athletes graduate from school, they
still compete with each other.

A current example is the I983 United Press International Rookie of
the Year. Seattle running back Curt Warner, a Nittany Lion alumnus,
won the award, taking 30 of 56 first—place votes. Miami quarterback
Dan Marino was a close second, receiving the rest of the 26 votes.
