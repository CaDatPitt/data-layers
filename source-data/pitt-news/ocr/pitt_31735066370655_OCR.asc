Posvar supports international expansion

By Nancy Quick
Assistant News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh is
gaining an international reputation
by increasing communications with
other countries on both academic
and socio-economic levels and
expanding its activities abroad.

“No university can claim_to be
great if it doesn’t have an interna-
tional dimension,” said Pitt Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar. “The
University of Pittsburgh is more
active internationally than most uni-
versities, boasting a strong Center
for International Studies that con-
centrates in East Asian, East Euro-
pean and Latin American regions.
We have 2,000 foreign students and
numerous faculty members involved
in research at the international
level.”

“No university can claim to be great if it doesn’t
have an international dimension. ”

—Dr. Wesley Posvar

President, University of Pittsburgh

Posvar traveled to Asia in July,
prompted by the University Center
for International Studies’ latest pro-
ject on “Regional Structural Change
in International Perspective.” The
project links the university not only
with academic colleagues abroad,
but with private and public sector
policy makers in the Pittsburgh
region and selected areas overseas.

“The RSCIP project‘ epitomizes

' the type of international activity the

99

university has been involved ‘in,
Posvar said. In Japan, Posvar met

Campus and city police plan local

By Karen Frost
The Pitt News

Each term campus and local city
police are plagued by parties, loud
stereos, theft and littered beer cans
that accompany the new wave of stu-
dents on and around the Pitt
campus.

This year city police at Station
No. 4 (on Louisa and Semple
Streets). are planning to crack down

on local law breakers, while Pitt’s '

campus police will be speaking to
students and resident assistants on
theft prevention and other safety
measures.

“Most of the problems where col-.

lege students rent apartments are
parties, loud music and beer cans
spread over lawns,”repor1ed Inspec-
tor William Ward of the Oakland

Police. «

This year he plans to get to th
students early. “Officers will give
residents an initial warning of the
violation and tell them to stop it,” he
said. “But the second time we might
just arrest them, depending on their
attitude and the conditions of the
violation.” ’

Ward said he thinks ouside parties
are fine, as long as they don't create
too much noise or get out of control.
“We're asking students to tone it
down,” he said. “We'll check ID s if
it’s necessary."

When it comes to theft, Ward said
college students are often victimized
off-campus. Too many students
leave their apartments unlocked if
they're going across the street for a
short time,” but it only takes one or
two minutes to walk in and out of
somebody’s apartment with their
belongings. Know the people in your

building and take steps to meet

with Osaka’s governor, mayor and
chamber of commerce to obtain an
agreement for Osaka to join the
world-wide study of advanced
industrial societies. —

“Osaka has joined the Ruhr
region in Germany, the Luxem-
bourg and Glasgow regionsand
Pittsburgh in the project,” Posvar
said. “More conferences are
planned, and Wuhan, China, will be
the next industrial society
approached.”

Posvar then traveled to Hong

Kong to address the possibility of
another international program at
Pitt. “Dr. Holzner.[director of Pitt’s
Center for International Studies]
and I made a presentation to a group
of Chinese leaders, all of whom were
private citizens, proposing an insti-
tute for Chinese studies at Pitt,”
Posvar explained. “A tri-lateral
agreement was established involving
Hong Kong, Pittsburgh and main-
land China to create a neutral place
for the cooperation of scholars and
expert practitioners concerned with
the future of China and dedicated to
the study of the transformation of
Chinese society and culture.”
Finally, Posvar went to India to
propose a program of Indian studies
for the university that was initiated
by the Telegn Scientists of America.
“In Hyderabad [capital of Andra
Pradesh, a state in India], I met with

Chief Minister Rao and signed a
draft agreement with Osmania Uni-
versity,” Posvar said. “In New

Delhi, I had further meetings with _

the Minister of Education and the

Chairwoman of the University,

Grants Commission.”

Pitt’s involvement in these high
level research projects promises to
expand the university's capabilities
for international research and to
increase its prestige abroad, Posvar
said. .

“We are making a real contribu-
tion to society,” said ‘Posvar. “By
bringing together people from dif-
ferent cultures, we increase oppor-
tunities to acquire new knowledge,

and by involving the political and /
business world — the real decision.
makers — with the academic world, 
we can improve communication .

between nations as a whole.”

Parking problem resolved  
through use of resident permits

By Kelly Shaffer
Staff Writer

Parking has always been ‘one of
the hazards of living in the city of
Pittsburgh. Since 1980, it has been a
major concern of Oaklandresidents.
The growth of the hospitals had resi-
dents wondering where they would
park.

To resolve the parking problem,
the Pittsburgh Planning Commis-
sion developed the Residential Per-
mit Parking Program in 1981. By
1983, all Oakland residents were
parking near their houses because of
the new program (RPP).

“The new program was designed
to allow residents to park in the vic-
inity of their houses,”stated local
Parking Administrator Richard
Meritzer. “Automobile owners
within a zoned area who purchase a
yearly permit are allowed to park on
the street in that specific zone all day

neighbors,” Ward said. This helps
residents to recognize strangers.

“If a girl sees a man in the apart-
ment that she is suspicious of, and
knows that he doesn’t belong there,
she can yell and get help before it’s
too late, rather than assume he
belongs in the building," stated
Ward.

Advice encouraging students to
protect valuables was echoed by
Walt Waters, assistant director of
public safety at Pitt. “Theft is a big
problem in the libraries, offices,
dorms and other university buld-
ings. New students every year don't
realize the importance of locking
doors and keeping valuables with
them when they go out.”

Dorm theft has decreased over the
past five years and Waters expects it
to stay low by talking to the resident
assistants and students about
locking--up.

-In the libraries, campus police

. .. ....o_r night,¢How_ever, local restrictions
V concerning street cleaning are to be

recognized," he added.

“A visitor's permitmay also be
purchased. These are available to all
households in the zoned area.
Ownership of a car is not necessary
for the puchase of this type of per-
mit,” stated Meritzer. The visitor
permit is for transients to the neigh-_

\ borhood, such as a repairman ser-

vicing one of the houses with
permits. The visitor permit, how-
ever, may not be used by the resident
or anyone else on a long term basis.

The Residential Permit Parking
Program was developed after the
Planning Commission had surveyed
other major cities and their parking
problems.

In Pittsburgh, the areas under_the ‘

RPP program include most of Oak-
land, parts of Bloomﬁeld, Law-
renceville and Sciota.’ Meritzer
pointed out that sections of Shady-
side and Bloomﬁeld” will be com-
pleted within the next year and a
half.

However, only one-fifth of the
city will be under the RPP program.

crackdown

have increased patrols, and signs

' have been posted to remind students

and staff to take purses and valua-
bles with them.

At Trees Hall, police can store
valuables for students in lockers
behind the reception booth. “The
best prevention is not to bring valua-
bles to Trees unless it's absolutely
necessary,” Waters said.

Fraternities are also being warned
of this problem. “Last year was an
experimental year because the frats
moved up by the stadium,” Waters
explained. “We expected more
problems at night, but a lot of prob-
lems came from local high school
students walking home. Four or five
would wait for one guy to walk
down the hillalone, and then jump
him.” He also reported attempted
burglaries in these buildings.

As a result of these problems,
campus police have added increased
car patrols duringthe afternoons as

“Most of the city is.completely,resi- »

dential or topographically inap-
propriate for regulated parking. If
an area is so residential and there are
no businesses in the area, then a
parking problem probably does not
exist. Also, if the area is very hilly,
no one will want to park and then
walk uphill,” said Meritzer.
Meritzer said he has noticed that a
ripple effect has taken place. When
one area begins to enforce the RPP
program, the -displaced parkers will
move to the next area with free park-
ing. the second area will then apply
for the program and the non-paying

. parkers will move on again.

If non-paying parkers leave their
autos in a zoned area, a parking
ticket will be isssued. The’fine is
$25.00 plus court costs. I

“If misuse of a visitor permit is‘

suspected (such as a resident using
the cheaper visitor permit) then the
plate and permit numbers will be
traced. If the misuse is confirmed,

then the information will be passed '
on to the meter maids. The vehicle -

will then be ticketed for the noted
continued on page 3

well as a foot patrol.

Waters said that a policeofﬁcer
talked to the fraternity presidents
concerningsafety at night and after
weekend parties. '_

“Officer Rogers noticed , girls»
walking home alone at 2 and 3 a.m.
after parties and asked the fraterni-
ties to provide escorts for late
guests,” Waters explained. “The fra-
ternities have been very good about
this and now ladies are always

escorted home. There is safety in‘

numbers. Students, especially
females, should take friends with
them.” -

Increased protection, student
awareness and early warnings are
methods both campus and city
police are using to keep crime at a
minimum. Ward said that campus
and city police rarely work together,
but have mutual agreement and
respect. Both forces are here if stu-
dents need help.

Reagan expected to veto sanctions

Riots
connnue

(UPI) —- In South Africa yester-

- day, racial violence extended into
white suburban neighborhoods for
the first time. Near Cape Town,
police were forced to close major
highways and warned motorists to
stay off other roads where youths

- were throwing stones. -

Veto
expected

(UPI) - President Reagan met
with national security advisers yes-
terday afternoon. Session White
House spokesman Larry Speakes
described the meeting as “an in-
depth review of the situation" in
South Africa.

A showdown between the White
House and Congress was expected
over economic sanctions against

South Africa. White House officials
expect Reagan to veto the sanctions
bill that Congress is expected to send
to his desk next week.

Reagan’s advisers are concerned
that the bill may have so much sup-
port that both houses of Congress

, will be able to override a presidential

veto and inflict a major foreign pol-
icy defeat on the president.

Reagan
crusades

(UPI) -— Nationally, President
Reagan continued his tax reform
crusade yesterday with a campaign-
style visit to North Carolina State
University in Raleigh. Reagan told
students and faculty members that
the way the tax system currently
stands, with 14 brackets and multi-
billion-dollar loopholes, it amounts
to what he calls “dumb economies.”

In support of his plan, Reagan
referred to his 1981 tax cut, saying
the 25 percent across the board
decrease “helped give us 32 straight
months of growth and helped create
nearly 8 million new jobs.”

Patient
0 O
cnhcal
(UPI) —— Doctors say that artifi-
cial heart patient Michael Drum-
mond has developed multiple, tiny
blood clots in his brain. They will
replace the mechanical device with a
human heart as soon as a donor
organ becomes available. Dr. Jack
Copeland, of the University of Ariz-
ona Medical Center, said that the

25-year-old Drummond probably
won't suffer any permanent damage

as a result of the tiny strokes, which -

have slurred his speech. ‘

Reactor
restarts?

(UPI) — The operator of Three.

Mile Island asked a federal court
yesterday to let it re-start its undam-

-aged unit one reactor. The utility
says there is no reason to keep the

reactor out of service since it was not
affected by the accident at its sister
reactor more than six years ago.

The third U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia gave the go-
ahead for a re-start last Tuesday, but
two days later, the same court issued
an order barring the GPU Nuclear
Corporation from firing up the
reactor.

The court prohibited the re-start
to give opponents time to file an
appeal. Spokesmen for the utility,
however, said keeping the reactor
idle is an enormous cost for ratepay-
ers and stockholders.

AT8T
accused

(UPI) — Officials of two long-
distance phone companies told a
U.S. Senate hearing yesterday that
American Telephone and Telegraph
Company still holds an almost total
monopoly, and they said the’ Federal
Communications Commission is
doing little to help.

AT 8 T computers installed 
for Student Government  

By John Zaphyr .
Staff Writer

Beginning this week, the Student
Government Board will enter the
computer age. A new AT&T compu-
ter system will be installed at a cost
of about $4,600, and the SGB will
immediately begin to reap the
benefits. a

“A big problem that any office has
is that when there is a lot of data that
needs to be stored, it is very hard to
find room for it all,” said SGB presi-
dent Luke Kluchko. “This new com-
puter system should make storing
much easier.”

The equipment will allow SGB
members to" do a variety of tasks

more efficiently and effectively.
“With this system, we will be able to
make up a lot more questionnaires,”
said Kluchko. “And get results in a
lot less time. -

“Before, it would take us nearly
two months to complete a question-
naire, and by the time we would get
the results, they would be out-dated
or not applicable. Now we should
get facts much quicker and reach
decisions sooner.”-

The system will also enable the
SGB to be more efficient in budget-
ing and general office work. More
names of students, government and
university officials, and corpora-
tions will be on- file and should make
the process ‘of mailing fliers and-
bulletins easier. ‘For Pitt students,
the new systems will mean more

questionnaires and a better under-
standing by the SGB of their
problems. “And,” said Kluchko, “all
this will make for a better student
government." .

The computer system will not
only assist this year's SGB — it will
serve future student governments as
well. “There will be a lot more servi-
ces available for students,” said
Kluchko. “Some _of them we don’t
even know about yet.”

The decision to purchase the new
computer system was made last
spring, and it took more than a
month to choose a satisfactory one.
“It took a lot of time and research to
make the decision,” said Kluchko.
“But we had to make the move now.
Later, it would have been very diffi-
cult to acquire a system."

Some late summer days
are good for nothing but
sitting in the shade. Such
was the case for David
M ilauskas, who chose to
take refuge under the
pedestrian bridge.

Meritzer said he feels that the pro-

gram is successful in the areas where
it has been implemented. “There is a
75 percent approval rating from the
residents in the zoned areas. We
send questionnaires along with the
renewal permit forms. Theresidents
like the program because it allows
them to park near their homes,”
stated Meritzer.
' The residents are also pleased
because of the safety factor
involved. “There are fewer strangers

Meritzer. '

Landlords

An article in the Sept. 2, 1985, edition of the Pittsburgh
Post- Gazette reported that nine employees of an
Oakland-based rental agency were arrested by Pittsburgh
police for the alleged bodily removal of a tenant and her
belongings from her apartment.

The incident occurred on Semple Street in Oakland
and, according to the Post-Gazette, included breaking
the chain lock on the tenant’s door and pulling out the
phone wires as she attempted to phone the police. Such

- events exemplify the sometimes harsh realities of tenant-

landlord relations in the Oakland area.

Many renters in Oakland are students from areas other
than Pittsburgh. Any renting students — but non-
Pittsburghers in particular —— may find themselves help-
less when up against the real estate magnates of the
Pitt-Car_low-CMU community.

Perhaps the Student Government Board, the Office of
Student Affairs, The Pitt News, and their counterparts at
neighboring universities, as student-oriented organiza-
tions, should look deeper into the problem of tenant
treatment in this college community. A coalition of these
groups could provide student renters with a place to take
landlord problems.

' College life can be difficult enough without the added

' hassles of poor landlord-tenant relations. Few students

have the time, energy or money to waste on ineffectual

negotiations; there is no reason why even those who do A
. should have to. '

From a female perspective/Nadia Moritz

One of the most raved and ridic-
uled subjects on the Pitt agenda — at
least, on the agenda of Pitt’s women
— comes up next week. The item is
sorority rush. Sorority rush?! Yes, I
realize the notion or mention of the
word “sorority” conjures up positive
and negative ideas and stereotypical
images, more of them than I care to
confront or contradict here and
now.

But I shall. Unfortunately — and I
speak from experience —' the soror-
ity is a facet of the American college

experience that lends itself, more .

than other organizations, to an
impractical degree of secrecy. It is
impractical because you ‘can see the
outside (sometimes very stereotypi-
cally), but you never gain a glimpse
of the inside.

I came to Pitt viewing sororities,
from the outside, as a group of
sometimes
youths who would rather shave their
hair than comb it, who barely

, washed their jeans let alone pressed

them. I, who didn't own a set of
pearls and who cringed at any

unnecessarily wild

In defense of sororities ‘

notion (good or bad) of conformity,
looked at myself and looked at them
— and said, “No way.” _
Then a friend tried to coax me to
rush, and I unwillingly agreed. ‘My
only intention was to take advantage
of a prime opportunity to visit these
cloned, intimidatingwomen and to

_ be as obnoxious as possible, just to

show them how ridiculous they
really were. ' ,

And now? I, too, have become one
of those women. And Pm not sure
exactly what happened, except that I
know it had nothing to do with suc-
cumbing to peer pressure, writing
checks, wearing pearls or a sudden
weakness to that still-dreaded
notion of conformity. But I do know
that it hada lot to do with meeting a
bunch of women I genuinely liked
and in whom I was interested. I
respected them for reasons of aca-
demics, achievements, maturity, and
for things I saw in them as women
that I wanted to see in myself some
day. A

They were just a bunch of women,
and you could get a similar collec-

tion if you grouped any dormitory
floor under the same roof and gave
them a title to sew across their sweat-
shirts and a common goal —— a goal
of philanthropy, community, kind-
ness or academics, or all of these.

A common goal is the thing that
binds together members of the foot-
ball team, student government or
the Heinz Chapel Choir. It is-some-
thing in which every individual in
the group believes strongly enough
to put aside’ differences. Though
compromise, .communication and
cooperation, they attempt to reach
their goal. This process induces the
learning and growing that people
generally call “experience."

On the football team, you learn to
play football; in the choir, you learn
to make music; in the sorority, you
learn to be a person. The sorority is
different, though. The football team
demonstrates that it has reached its
goals by winning games; the choir,
through successful concerts. With
the sorority, however, the proof is
on the inside — within the hearts of
each of its members.

The Pitt News - September 6, 1985

From Under My Desk/Dan Bates
Seniors need time for orientation, too, you know

For the past week, the Pitt cam-
pus has been swarming with incom-
ing freshmen. Hundreds of them
have been happily attending -the
many events that cater especially to
freshmen.

There are games to encourage stu-
dent interaction, elaborate picnics
that provide food and entertain-
ment, personal introductions to
Pitt’s president and other adminis-
tration officials, and there are plenty
of tours of the campus. That’s all
very nice, isn’t it?

In reality, though, someone in
dire need of orientation was com-
pletely left out of all the excitement.
You guessed it — that person was
me. Me! I know what they’ll tell me:
they will exclaimthat I am a senior
now, a big boy of sorts. They will say
that by now I should know what I
am doing and where I am going.
And I should have direction. Oh, but
I do know where the Cathedral of
Learning is. I guess that's a good
start, right? Wrong.

But let’s face it, folks, I needed the
orientation just as much as, if not
more, than those freshmen. Yes, by
gosh," I am a senior, and I am still

caution and pure anxiety with which
I would-approach a complex garden
maze. After receiving my bill, I
headed for Bruce Hall, or was it
Mervis Hall — I mean, Thackeray
Hall. I was sent back to Bruce Hall,
then back to Thackeray. After regis-
tering for classes, I went across the

oueetisco
ti s’ roots of

hall to the cashier’s area. They sent
me upstairs to student accounts,
which then sent me back to Bruce
Hall. Don’t even try to follow that
one.

If that wasn’t bad enough, they
sent me a second bill and expected
me to do it all again. They’re crazy!

My first day of class followed in a
similar fashion. ‘After searching for
my communications class on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral, I dis-
covered that the listed classroom

was merely a locked closet. That was _

OK, though, because the actual class

was right next door — or so I‘

thought. How was I to know that
this room overﬂowing with students
was a classical literature class?

I took a deep breath and calmly
approached this small set-back as
any senior would. I traveled to the
advising center on the 9th floor to
investigate the scheduling screw-up.
“Can I help you?” the receptionist
asked. Out of breath, I simply
nodded. Looking at me oddly, she
asked, “Are you a freshman or
something?” I was humiliated, and I
felt foolish. .

But I quietly whispered, “No, I'm

Ha!" she laughed.
When I finally reached the correct

classroom, I realized that I wasn’t -

even registered for that class in the
first place. I just can't win, you
know?

I don’t think freshmen even have
that much trouble. But why should

they? Orientation is supposed to prc-_ I

does — I didn’t see too many fresh- V

Dr. Posvar face to face, in person?
After four years, Ifinally got my first

glimpse of the president. At the big ..

picnic, the freshmen all got to shake
his hand, in person. Is that fair?

Everything is geared toward the
freshmen, leaving all the other lost
and confused students to fend for
themselves. I suggest the administra-

week for us. Well — for me, anyway.
Maybe, just maybe, I will begin to

' USA for Africa and Live Aid have
again made their mark on Pitts-
burgh. Area artist Lisa Fedon has
created a “Sculpture Bank” to raise
money for African famine relief, and
it is being exhibited today through
Oct. 6 at the Carnegie Institute
Museum of Art. Patrons are urged
to donate money by dropping coins
into the sculpture.

The 11 by ll structure, con-
structed of ﬂat iron and wire mesh,
depicts a map of the United States
superimposed over a map of Africa.
Donations/are placed into two slots
in the United States, and then fall
into _Africa.

Fedon, a Penn State graduate,
was inspired to build the philan-
thropic sculpture by the Live Aid
concerts held in Philadelphia and
London in July. She sculpted the
work out of window and door
screening and outlined it with ﬂat
metal stripping.

The “Sculpture Bank” is not sol-
dered or welded. Fedon forms her
work with physical strength. “I just
stick it in a vice and pound on it and
jump on it and bind it around. I try
to perfect creating the figure with as
few lines as possible,” she said.

“After watching Live Aid concerts
I thought ‘Why aren’t visual artists

"doing something similar?’ I just

think the whole USA for Africa
thing is great,” Fedon said.

As a resident of Connellsville,
Fedon is aware of the plight of the
unemployed in western Pennsylva-
nia but sai_d_she feels aid for the fam-

ine victims in Africa is more urgently
needed.

681-9961 -

“Living in Western Pennsylvania,
I see many people out of work. and
it’s really difficult for them,” said
Fredon. “But when you see pictures
of people starving in Africa, it really
puts things into perspective.”

The sculpture has received the
Sylvan Jacobson Award at the cur-
rent Associated Artists of Pitts-
burgh’s_ 75th Annual Exhibition and
Fedon has donated the $300 prize
money to the USA for Africa fund.

“I’m not one to ask people for
money,‘so I hope people will'follow
my example,” Fedan said.

Despite western Pennsylvania’s
feeble economic condition, Fedon
said she feels that Pittsburghers
won’t hesitate to donate money.

“I_ think Pittsburgh’s depressed
economy won't really effect the con-
tributions,” she said. “I think people"
can afford to drop a dollar into the
‘Sculpture Bank’.” -

Lance Duffy, the director of USA
for Africa fund in Pittsburgh,
agrees.

“The economic situation in Africa
is probably 50 to 60 times worse than
it is .here,” Duffy said. “There are
people literally dying from
starvation.”

Fedon has no plans to create more
works for USA for Africa. “I just
hope that many people will donate
something to the famine relief."

“If everybody who visits the
exhibit gives one dollar, we could
raise as much as $50,000. I don’t
think one dollar is too much to ask,”

Duffy said.

Fedon’s been making wire sculp-
ture for over eight years, but this is
the first piece she's created to benefit
the USA for Africa fund. The

Support group is established
for victims of eating disorders

By Joe Krzywiecld
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh's
Health Education Office is now
sponsoring a support group for
those afflicted with anorexia ner-
vosa and bulimia. Pitt is the first
college in the Pittsburgh area to do
so.
The main value of the support
group, according to Anita Sin-
icrope, president of the Pittsburgh
Educational Network for Eating
Disorders, is that it letsthose suffer-
ing from anorexia or bulimia know
they are not alone with their
problems.

Bulimia and anorexia nervosa are
eating disorders that primarily affect
the female population, and females
aged 13 to 22 are in a high risk
group. Sinicrope said that 20 to 25
percent of college aged women are
engaging in some type of eating
disorder. «

Sinicrope described anorexia as a
fear of getting fat. “No matter how
much weight the girl loses, the fear
of being fat remains,” Sinicrope
said. “I have had 85 to 95 lb. girls
talk about how fat their thighs are,”

she added. “They have a distorted.

body image.”

Many girls who begin to diet
because they have a weight problem
are often unable to stop once they
reach a normal weight.

Most people suffering from either
disease, Sinicrope believes, are girls
who lack self esteem and assertive-
ness. “These women are the so-
called perfect girls. They always did
what they were told to do, and were
often dominated by their families.”

Sinicrope went on to say that ano-
rexia and bulimia victims believe
that their lives are out of control.
“They are not sure about their iden-
tity. The only control they feel they
have left is whether or not to eat.”
She believes that when these women
grow up and go to college and are

No matter how much
weight a girl loses, the
fear of being fat remains.
I have had 85 to 95 lb.
girls talk about how fat
their thighs are.”
——Anita Sinicrope
President, Pittsburgh‘
Educational Network
for Eating Disorders

faced with the pressures of school-
work and being away from home,
the eating problems occur.
.Sinicrope also believes eating dis-
orders strike more women than men
because of the pressures of modern
society on women. “People,” she
said, “are being brainwashed that
being thin means that you are attrac-

- tive. Women are forced to think that

their bodi_es "should look a certain
way because of the media’s way of
presenting women.” .
Anorexia is a “profound and life
threatening disorder with. a 5‘ to l0

percent mortality rate," Sinicrope

said. Anorexia victims can literally

starve themselves to death. As ano- _

rexia reaches its ﬁnal stages the
immunity system of the .victim’s
body fails due to malnutrition. This
leaves the body’s defenses suscepti-
ble to various illnesses. The chief
cause of death with anorexia victims
is heart and kidney failure.

“Bulimia,” Sinicrope said,“is just
as dangerous as anorexia because
many girls believe that bulimia is a
benign behavior, but once they
begin its hard to stop.”

Bulimia, Sinicrope said, is an eat-
ing disorder that involves binge eat-
ing, which usually occurs at night
and is kept hidden from family and
friends. After the binge follows a
period where the bulimic purges her-

self of the food by vomiting, use of
diuretics, or a severely restrictive
diet. Sinicrope also said that the
bulimic is often caught in a cycle
characterized by feelings of guilt and
shame. “If a girl cats to feel better
about herself and then purges all of
the food she ate because she feels
guilty, she can consider herself a vic-
tim of bulimia."

In order to help someone suffer-
ing from an eating disorder, Sin-
icrope said that it is best to talk with
the victim. “My advice to college-
age women is not to be afraid to
confront their friends if they think
their friends are suffering from an
eating disorder. Often the victim

does not believe she is suffering from '

an eating disorder. There can be an
argument or a denial that such a
problem exists. However, this can
open up an avenue of communica-
tion and lead the victim to seek help.
The anorexic and bulimic can only
be treated with professional help. St.
Francis Hospital and Western Psy-
chiatric Hospital are two area insti-
tutions that specialize in eating
disorders.”

Sinicrope said she believes that an
eating disorder can be prevented in
its earliest stages if women were
given the proper information. “At
support group meetings, we discuss
the problems of the anorexic and
bulimic person in a completely non-
judgmental way.

“Support groups also include fam-
ily members and provide parents,
siblings, and spouses with the
opportunity to learn more about
these disorders as well as sharing

their own experiences with the

disease.”

The first meeting of the Pitt sup-
port group will be September 11, in
room 205 of the William Pitt Union.
No fee is charged and all are wel-
come to attend. For further infor-
mation about bulimia and anorexia

work for Eating Disorders at (412)

The Meat Puppets are from
Phoenix, Ariz., a place where an
imagination has room to develop, a
place where a rock band has room to
breathe. It's a place where the Meat
Puppets thrive, where you can hear
Curt Kirkwood's throbbing, melodic
guitar riffs and high—pitched yet
monotone voice cut through the
strong, pounding rhythms of brother
Chris Kirkwood's bass and the drums
of Derek Bostrom. The relentless
rhythm section keeps things from
getting too laid back.

Formerly recognized as a traveling
wall of distortion, the Puppets have,
with Up On the Sun (their third album),
managed to keep at least a foot or two
in reality.

As the cloud of distortion passed

over the band, it revealed a. sound‘

that is as interesting and as original as
anything going. Up On the Sun, on a
first listening, sounds like some kind
of surreal hoedown and slowly folds
out for the listener into a great
pop/rock album laiden with musical
hooks

According to Derek, the transition
into their new, more focused sound
was a matter‘ of pure evolution. "We
cut our first record, and believe it or
not, we didn't consider it a hardcore
record. They [the critics] said it was,
so we wanted to put out a mellow
record. Then they decided we were
country, and we're not. So as the
records come out, we get input, and
we realize what we've been doing
wrong, and we try and put out a
record that we like.

"Up On the Sun is the first record

' we've been able to perform live. It's

’

reality, and

the clearest distillation of what the
band actually is. You see, we're all
conceptual artists, and sometimes we
have trouble sticking to reality in our
art. We let our fancy flow into our
records. Sometimes we're not very
practical.”

Derek likes Elvis Presley. He claims
to be working on a book about Elvis.
It will consist of 16 separate essays -r—
all conflicting with each other. He
also likes the New York Mets. Sitting
across the table wearing a grey T-
shirt with the Mets’ logo emblazened
on it, he periodically checks the score
of a game on a portable radio. He's

Chris is amused by the idea of sign-

in a shopping mall. He's much more
reserved, however, about the band's
future. .

"Our marketing scheme is basically
to be the best musicians and the best
band we can possibly be. I don't care
about it [fame and fortune] enough to
follow the routes that are available —
like trendiness or whatever. We get a

Tired of the bar scene? Sick of having
to say, ”Do you come here often?”
There are millions of people all over
the world who share your predica-
ment. And we can help.

No, no, this is not that kind of”sin-
gles” column. We're talking here
about music, that structured noise
that you people feed daily into your
brains in alarming quantities. With all
the sources available to the listener,

one must learn to discriminate. That's .

right. Not all of what you hear on the
radio is necessarily good. In fact, most
of it is pretty bad.

This column, the first of a weekly
series, will try to help you to discern
between what is worthwhile and
what is slop. People are snatching up
455 and 12" remixes faster than you
can say" "consumerism,” and the
existence of this column reflects that
trend. Bring it with you on your next
trip to the record mart.

The Cure: "In Between Days"

In their varied and remarkable
career, The Cure have, for some mys-
terious reason, never ‘attained wide-
spread popularity in this country.

This single could change that. True to 

their credo of never sounding the
same from record to record, The

' Cure sound an awful lot like New

Order these days. And it's very
becoming. ”In Between Days" is brief
but exhilarating, an emotional rush
that ends long before one wants it to.
I eagerly await their new album.‘

The Fat Boys: "The Fat Boys are ‘Batk"

I like good rap as much as anyone,
but this is not good rap. In such a
limited genre, you need more than a
lukewarm gimmick (in this case, all
the band members being horren-
dously overweight), to make an inter-
esting song. The food references
cease to be amusing after about a
minute, and from there on it's sheer
tedium. Rap needs a savior or else it's
gonna die.

Cyndi Lauper: ”The Goonies ‘R’ Good

me about this song is that it has
nothing to do with Goonies. Not that
I love silly songs aboutpirates, but
such a blatant money-grab makes my
heart harden even toward the peren-
nially adorable Miss Lauper. A dis-
turbing trend, this mating of movies
and pop stars, but only when it starts
to affect the good bands will I worry.

The Rave-Ups: ”Positively I.ost Me” I

The Rave-Ups are a country-
flavored, better-than-average indy-
label band whose debut single holds a
good deal of promise. It's not stun-
ning, but a good sense of melody and
a smart, tight rhythm section give the
song the kick it needs. The B—side is a
nice reading of Dylan’s- ”You Ain't

The Ramones: "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg"

Over Johnny's protests, America's
favorite career delinquents have been
getting political these days, and more
power to them. Even without the
advantage of topicality (this, sadly,
will be dated in a year), ”Bonzo” is one
of the Ramones’ most relentless,
direct songs ever. I dare anyone to try
not singing along’ with the exuberant,
stadium-size chorus.

Corey Hart: "Never Surrender" 4

One of the biggest difficulties in
writing Top-40 songs is coming up
with new cliches. The idea of never
surrendering is an old one, but
dreamy Corey Hart has given it some
fresh meaninglessness. The bridge of
this song is an almost note-for-note
cop of the verse of Graham Parker's
”Wake Up Next to You," though
Parker's song had a good hook. Corey
Hart wouldn't know a hook if he were
hanging on one.

Squeeze: "Last Time Forever"

Just prior to presstime, I heard the
single from Squeeze’s new album on
the radio. I don't even know what it's
called, but it was the first time in
about a year that a song has spon-
taneously sent goosebumps up and
down my spine. ”Last Time Forever,”
released last June, is just as good. This
band is indeed back. Their sound has
a new sophistication and polish, their
songwriting has improved with age,
and Glenn Tilbrook’s soaring
soprano is as enchanting as ever.
Ivory—tickler extraordinaire Jools
Holland provides the touch that was
missing from the band's latter work,
namely an original, diverting instru-
mentalist. This single has been the
summer's best-kept secret. Go buy it.

I don't mind admitting that I'd
given up on John Mellencamp. While
some of his songs—like ”Jack and
Diane” and ”Pink Houses”—have
hinted at a potential for greatness,
they fell short, bogged down by trite-
ness and cliche. Mellencamp was too
self-conscious in his disclaiming Jack
and Diane's story as a ”little ditty;"
too vague in his patriotism on ”Pink
Houses.” Clearly he was fascinated
by America, but he had nothing of
interest to say about it. It seemed that
he was doomed to the minor leagues.

That is why his breakthrough is so
exciting. Scarecrow, his eighth lp, pla-
ces John Mellencamp very near the
forefront of American songwriters.

He still wears his influences on his
sleeve—the gaunt, black-and-white
album cover suspiciously resembles
the cover of Bruce Springsteen's
Nebraska—but the music that his
music now most resembles, namely
that of Tom Petty and the Heart-
breakers and Creedence Clearwater
Revival, is much more within his
reach. In lowering his ambitions and
coming to terms with his limitations,
Mellencamp has begun fully to
mature as a songwriter.

That maturity is in evidence on the
lp’s first song, ”Rain on the Scare-
crow,” which deals with the plight of
the American farmer. His experience
seems first-hand as he sings, Well,
there's ninety-seven crosses planted in the
courthouse yard/ Ninety-seven families who
lost ninety-seven farms/ I think about my

grandpa and mygneighbors and my name/
And some nights lfeel like dying like that
scarecrow in the rain."

"Grandma's Theme/"a folk song
sung by his grandmother, complete
with scratchy-old—record production,
threatens to assassinate any claim to
integrity that the album may have
had, but its gentle acoustic guitar
makes a striking contrast with the
opening chords of ”Small Town,” a
stirring celebration of rural America.
He's still no Hank Williams, but Mel-
lencamp is learning how to sing about

his

roots without embarrassing,
himself.

It also seems probable that some-
time between recording his last lp and
the present, he experienced his first
real relationship. There is a‘ new
depth in his songs about men and
women that reflects a great deal of
sensitivity. ”Lonely 01’ Night” des-
cribes two lovers whose flame has
long since extinguished but who still
cling to one another: Can I put my arms
around you?/ It's a lonely ol' night/‘ Custom
made for two lonely people like me and you.
And ”Between a Laugh and a Tear” (a
duet featuring Rickie Lee Jones), save
for the brash rock chords‘, sounds like
itcould have been a classic C&W bal-

 

lad: When this cardboard town can no_longer
amuse you/ You see through everything and
nothing seems worthwhile/ And "hypocrite"
used to be such a big word to you/ It don't seem
to mean anything to you now. I never

would have thought that John Cou-

‘ gar could write an authentically mov-

ing song.

There is still a lot here to complain
about. Mellencamp has a way of trip-
ping over his own earnestness, as he
does in the ridiculous allegory ”Jus-
tice and Independence '85.” Many of
the songs suffer from a certain same-
ness; the chord changes are often
predictable and lacking in invention.
Further, Mellencamp's lyrics, while
showing an unquestionable growth,
can still be moralistic, self-righteous

_and downright stupid, especially in

songs like ”You’ve Got to Stand for
Somethin’ ” and ”R.O.C.K. in the
U.S.A.” He also needs to rely less on
tried-and-true chord progressions.

Scarecrow is not a brilliant album.
Mellencamp will never be a songwri-
ter of the calibre of Bruce Spring-
steen, Bob Dylan or even Tom Petty.
If you're looking for stunning
insights into the human condition,
you won't find them here. What you
will find is an older, perhaps wiser
songwriter making heartfelt and sur-
prisingly unpretentious music. John
Mellencamp is no longer a national
embarrassment. He is, with Scarecrow,
an artist worth listening to.

The Pitt News - September 6, 1985 .

Art Blakey: A sto

By David. Zuchowski

The 1985 Pittsburgh Jazz Festival,
now in full swing, is dedicated to a
Pittsburgh born—and-bred son,
drummer Art Blakey. Raised in the
midst of the Depression by his step-
mother, he worked in the steel mills
by day and played keyboard in jazz
clubs by night.

Once whenBlakey was playing the
ivories at the Ritz Club, Errol Garner
walked in. sat down at the keyboard
and blew Blakey’s mind with his
prowess. Theiclub owner had him fill
in on the drums for Garner, and Bla-
key has remained a drummer ever
since.

In 1939, he joined the Fletcher
Henderson Band fora short stint,
then moved on to play with Mary Lou
William's first big band. From 1944 to
1947, after a period of leading his
own bands, Blakey joined the Billy
Eckstine Orchestra and played with

the likes of Dizzie Gillespie, Fats

Navarro, Miles Davis, Dexter Gor-
don and Charlie (Parker. While with
Eckstine, he caught the eye of Alfred
Lion, owner of Blue Note Records.
Lion was so impressed that, in the
years to follow, Blakey was virtually
the house’ drummer at Blue Note

Records. -
In 1949, Blakey formed a combo,

named the Seventeen Messengers.
Playing in New York the band was a
disaster and eventually broke up. His
resurgence began when he teamed up
with Silver, Clifford Brown, Curley
Russell and Lou Donaldson at Bird-
land and recorded an unrehearsed
album for Blue Note called A Night at
Birdland.
In November 1954, Blakey and
Silver joined Kenny Dorham on
trumpet, Hank Mobley on sax and

 

Ar Blakey

Doug Watkins on bass to form what
has now become a jazz institution,
the Jazz Messengers. The group

"represented a "brand of modern jazz

called ”hard bop” by the critics. Hard
bop, in a sense, represented ”a retreat
from the complexity that had over-
taken modern jazz and was a redis-
covery of jazz roots,” reports Robert
Palmer in-The New York Times (June 26,
1981i

'Since 1954, the Jazz Messengers

ry of jazz anda

 

have been playing with a new crop of
musicians, some of which have
achieved stardom on their own, like
Curtis Fuller,
Wayne Shaster
Mangione. ‘

For Blakey, the drum is the instru-
ment that is "close to the human

and Chuck

soul.” He reasons, in the November’

1979 issue of Downbeat Magazine, that
”If your heart don't beat, you are
dead; if you don't walk in rhythm,

Freddie Hubbard, '

 

Bnteﬂalnment'  I

big beat 

you can't walk — You have to chew

your food in rhythm. Everything is in, '

time."

His playing has been described as
sounding more like an orchestral per-
cussion section than a single
drummer. He can downshift from
powerful crescendos to the softest
strokes on a cymbal and is especially
noted for his intricate cross rhythms
on a rock. steady beat. He has a_,driv-
ing emotional style that is filled with
so many levels of sound that there is
an illusion of great" rhythmic waves
washing over and through his music.

Blakey’s style has changed little
over the years. He scoffs at the

extended solos of the avant-garde_

drummers by saying, ”At the end,
you don't know whether people are
‘applauding because they enjoyed it,
or because they're glad it's finished."

Blakey enjoys playing. For him, the
bandstand is a cocoon that shuts out
personal problems. ”Music has got to
befun. If you don't’ enjoy it, you
might as well go out and sell
insurance.”

Art Blakey will wrap up the 1985
Pittsburgh Jazz Festival with a free
performance at Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park this Sunday, Sept. 8,
beginning at 8 p.m., when he teams
up with the current band members:
Terence_Blanhard, trumpet; Donald
Harrison, alto sax; Jean Toussaint,
tenor sax; Mulgrew Miller, piano;

and Lonnie Plaxico, bass. Performing ’

at the same concert will be Nathan
Davis and the Tomorrow Band.
Davis is a saxophonist and a profes-
sor at the-University of Pittsburgh,
where he has helped establish and

‘(develop the university's jazz studies

program at both undergraduate and
graduate levels.

want to do that route."

Like other bands on the SST record
label who are often lumped together,
the Meat Puppets are fiercely inde-
pendent. They insist, however, that
the connection pretty much ends
there. Derek is very proud of the

independence the band has
maintained.

"We're basically a new experiment
in pop music. We're a non-controlled,
non-contrived rock aet attempting to
do something new, something that's

a lot more concrete and traditionally I

artistic than your standard pop. It's a

' lot less commercialized or fake. Most

things, though, are contrived. Elvis
was contrived! I mean, I love Elvis and
contrived rock and everything, but
it's too self-destructive, and people
end up killing themselves.

"We're trying to make a band that
will actually survive, if that sounds
kind of silly or corny. But one of our
basic concepts when we first started
was, ‘Hell, we like each other. We can
support each other emotionally, so
let's keep the ego trips on the back
burner and try to keep it going in a
real sort of a way.’

"We want to show people that

rock-n-roll isn't just composed of’

egotistical bird—brains, cement-heads
and what-not. Some bands have a
manager before they have all of their
members. They make it big with their
game plan.” An example? Let's take it
back once again to the original, says
Derek, to Elvis. "His Sun [first
recording studio] sessions appealed
to critics from a critic's point of view.
He chose special material to record. It
was rock critic-type music. It was
cool. He recorded hip covers. It was
basically revisionist. People liked him

V Enltertelnmvent

 Meat Puppets coming to terms with reality

because he brought things that they
thought were cool out into the open.
A lot of bands do that. Most do.

"If you're going to say something
real, you've got to take a chance. You
can just say ’I want to be cool’ and
stick with what's cool. If you actually
want to deal with life, you sometimes
have to make a fool of yourself. I like
Cyndi Lauper, and I like bands like
that, but I think that their attitude is
really crass, and in the long run it isn't
very helpful. I think it's all a flash in
the pan. I think the Meat Puppets are
the wave of the future.”

The wave of the future? Well,
that's a claim that would lie heavily
on the shoulders of Curt. He's the
one who, according to brother Chris,
"takes ideas or riffs and turns them
into songs.”

Curt .Kirkwood is tall. He has long
hair; he's lanky, and he usually wears
cowboy boots. He's also a father of

The News - September 6, 1985

twins. He's the calmest of the three
and seemingly the most introverted.

He sits across the table in a booth at
Chief's Cafe. Mostly he watches and
listens, rarely smiling, as if he could
live vicariously off of the conversa-
tion and laughter of others.

Showcase: There seems to be a lot
more light than darkness on Up On the
Sun. ‘ ‘

Curt: Yeah, well, I think -—— well, I
don't want to scare my children.
Anybody can be negative and write
about how bad things are. Only the
truly talented can be optimistic about
life.

Showcase: How big do you want to
be? I mean, you don't seem like a band

. that has a lot of Machiavellian

schemes about becoming the biggest
thing going. -

Curt: You have to look at the word
Machiavellian real closely there.
Machiavelli never made any of his

schemes apparent. That's why he was
Machiavelli.

Showcase: Was Up On the Sun a nat-
ural evolution for the band or an
attempt at accessibility?

Curt: It was, just as always, an
attempt to put down what we were
doing_at the time on record. I want to
prosper for sure, but I don't think I
know what it is to be that big. I can say
that my desires are really a lot more
personal than that. '

Showcase: What kind of music did

you like as a kid?

Curt: Whatever was on the radio.

Derek: They don't believe that we
like Duran Duran.

Curt: Oh, yeah!

Showcase: How about Madonna?

Soccer team opens

against Califomia today  

The Pitt soccer team opens
tonight at Pitt Stadium. It plays host
to visiting California University of
Pennsylvania at 7:15 p.m. Coach
Joe Luxbacher and his crew will
look to improve on last year’s 9-6-1
record with a slew of experienced
personnel returning.

Back to head the Panther attack

this year is senior forward Sparky
Lucke, from Garden City Park,
N.Y. He will be joined by fellow
senior Victor Hugo. Hugo, a mid-
ﬁelder from Arlington, Va., is a .ver-
satile performer who possesses one
of the stronger shots on the team.
Defensively, ‘senior Brian Casey
heads what turned out to be the
strength of the soccer team last year.
Casey, a native of Burke, Va., is a
three-year starter and letter winner.
He is said to be a tough and aggres-
sive defender. .
Dave.Torrence will man the goal.
Torrence won the goal position two
years ago and went on to tie the

school record for shutouts that year

with six. He has the talent and abil-'

ity to dominate the goal area, as he
proved in 1983.

The Panthers went from 9-l0-l
two years ago to 9-6-1 last year, and
now they will look‘ to join the elite of

the soccer world in the East. With a -

schedule that includes Penn State,
Villanova and West Virginia down
the line, the road_will not be easy.
Penn State. had been nationally
ranked every year, and the other two
contenders are -also quality teams.
The Big East tournament looms in
the near future. With the conference
split into two divisions, North and
South, the Panthers need only ﬁnish
as one of the top two teams in the
division to qualify for the tourna-
ment. The division comprises Vil-
lanova, Seton Hall and George-
town._
It’s Pitt versus California, tonight
at 7:15 at Pitt Stadium. Be there!

Woods another

Hugh Green type ?

By Michael Bertonaschi
The Pitt News

Through the magic of E.S.P.N., it
is possible to be a part of the exciting
atmosphere of a college football
game and then go home and turn on

. the television and watchit again a

few hours later. If twice is not
enough, you can watch it a third
time the next afternoon.

After viewing a game two or three
times, a fan can better appreciate the
difference between the good plays
and the bad plays.

During the second quarter of last
Saturday night’s 31-30 win over
Purdue, Boilermaker tailback Rod-
ney Carter took a delayed handoff
from quarterback Jim Everett and
cut wide to his right. As he did, his
eyes must have lit up because no Pitt
defender could be seen in the general
area’.

As Carter broke outside and
headed for the sideline with pay-dirt
on his mind, a Panther player sud-
denly appeared out of nowhere. Car-
ter was next seen lying on his back
out of bounds, with two huge arms
wrapped around his shoulder pads.

As the two players got on their
feet and headed towards their
respective huddles and the fans
moaned, someone in the crowd
asked,“Who’s that No. 90?”

No. 90 is of course Tony Woods?»-
and after watching the game for the

- third time, you can appreciate the

contributions he made even more.
He batted an attempted screen
pass by Everett into the air and then
grabbed it for a drive-killing inter-
ception. He sacked Everett once and
later on, with two minutes remain-
ing in the game, chased him out of

bounds to the opponent’s sidelines.

All in all, No. 90 had 12 tackles
(eight were unassisted and two were
for losses), one sack and one
interception. .

Last Saturday could have bC€’-If
the long awaited arrival of Tony
Woods. In 1983, Street and Smith
magazine listed Woods in the sec-
tion “Cream of the 1983 College
Frosh” as one of the top linebackers
in the country. During the preceding
winter months when the letters of
intent were in, the local high school
scouting gurus talked of Woods as a
potential Hugh Green.

A comparision like that would
please any high school player, but it
was especially gratifying to Tony
Woods. He had been a Hugh Green
fan since the first time he saw the
Panthers on television. Woods con- ‘
siders Green something of a here/if
saying, “I try to pattern myself after
him.”

It’s not easy to pattern yourself

Oklahoma to win it all, McCallum to run away with the Heisman  

i§’y Jim Brueclmer
Staff Writer .

The summer of 1985 proved to be
a memorable one, one of ultimate
achievement. It brought us Live Aid,
the most celebrated beneﬁt concert
ever. There was the emergence of
John Rambo, the greatest American
hero since John Wayne and Audie
Murphy.

The world of sports also had its
shining moments. It was a summer
when Thomas Hearns and Marve-
lﬁs Marvin Hagler together pro-
duced what was to be called the
single most exciting round in the
long history of pugilistic encounters.
Seventeen-year-old Boris Becker
provided the all-time upset by
emerging victorious at Wimbledon
despite being unseeded.

But now we look forward to the
fall with the question, “Can the
excitement continue?”

Much of the excitement this fall
figures to.come from the world of
college football. If the opening
weekend was any indication of
gaings to come, this season looks to
lie anything but boring.

The Pitt-Purdue game ended with
one of the wildest finishes in recent
Pitt history. I find myself question-
ing the pass interference call on

its

Keith Tinsley on the 2-point conver-
sion. It appeared that Tinsley deliv-
ered the hit just as the ball arrived.
Nevertheless, a flag was thrown, and
Purdue was given another shot. Per-
haps the reason for Purdue’s Jim
Everitt throwing an incomplete pass
to his most wide-open receiver of the
night was “divine intervention” to
make up for the bad call.

One player who certainly looked
divine - was Charles Gladman. His
6.8-yards-per-carry looks good
enough at first glance, but it looks
even better at _second glance. Con-
sider that his longest run of the night
was only 23 yards, and it comes to
light that Gladman was consistently
getting six yards per try, unlike those
who gain three or four yards per try
and then pick up a 70-yard run late
in the game when the outcome has
already been decided, thus inﬂating
a deceiving average.

One other player who left his
coaches (not to mention his father)
with smiles on their faces was Ala-
bama quarterback Mike Shula.
Though he didn’t produce the kind
of stats that Robbie Bosco turned in
against Boston College, Shula got
the job done when it counted. Look-
ing very much like former Alabama
quarterback Kenny Stabler, Shula

led his team down the ﬁeld with less ~

 

OLLTHOMECOMING COMMITTEE MEETING

FRIDAY, September 6th — 4 p.m.

than two minutes remaining to the
game-winning touchdown.

While he wasn’t leading his team
to a thrilling last-minute victory,
what Robbie Bosco was doing was
throwing for over 500 yards against
Boston College to establish himself
as one of the leading contenders for
this year's Heisman Trophy.

Ohio State’s Keith Byars was the
favoritethis year until Fate rolled
him “snake eyes” on Labor Day,
when Byars broke a bone in his foot.
This type of injury takes anywhere
from a few weeks to a few months to
heal. If he is slow to recover, it could
cost him the Heisman and Ohio
State a shot at the Big Ten Title.

Even with a speedy recovery by
Byars, I still think that the “trip to
Pasadena” will be decided in the
Nov. 9 clash between Iowa and Illi-
nois. This race for Big Ten suprema-
cy figures to be one of the best in
college football this season.

However, the race for their oppo-
nent in the Rose Bowl will be that
much more exciting. While some are
predicting a Top Ten finish for
Washington, it is very possible that
they could end the season fourth in
their own conference; Yes, the Pac
Ten looks to have one of its best
races ever. i "

  TOURNAMENT

 sEI>T.23.2a, A   

 
 
  

 

The ultimate in excitement will be
found in the Southwest Conference
where no less than six teams have
realistic chances of winning a spot in
the Cotton Bowl. Listing them in
order of their chances, the contend-
ers will be: Arkansas, SMU, Texas,
Houston, Texas A&M and TCU.

Speaking of races, in the race for
national honors, the pre-season
polls have both Washington and
Nebraska highly overrated, in my
opinion. Even the Roman Empire
fell. Look for these two mighty foot-
ball empires to do the same.

There is little chance of Penn
State’s overrating Maryland this
weekend. This season, Maryland
will actually challenge State for the
No. 1 spot in the nation.

Auburn is looking for double the.
fun by winning the national title as
well as escorting Bo Jackson to the
Heisman.

My two personal favorites for
these coveted awards have yet to be
mentioned. After long deliberation
and the consultation of "many gyp-
sies and a “reading of the stars," I
have come to the conclusion that
Napoleon McCallum will win the

Heisman, and the Oklahoma Soon-
ers will win the National
Championship. '

The Naval Academy made history
last season by granting McCallum
the first “redshirt” in its history. It
was done primarily with the thought
that he could win the Heisman this
year, thus boosting the academy’s
recruiting power. He will not let
them down. '

Surprise! Oklahoma will win the
No. 1 spot in the polls with the
nation’s best defense instead of the
typically high-powered offenses of
past Sooner teams. Don’t get me
wrong.-The offense will be as good
as ever, but the‘ defense looks to
break a few records -— as well as a
few heads. It is very possible that
Oklahoma can go through the entire
season without giving up even one
80-yard touchdown drive. Teams
will need turnovers and luck to score
against the Sooners.

The summer was ﬁlled with
excitement, but the fall could be
even better. We are already off to a
good start with the announcement
that “M*A“S*H" will be on for a
whole hour now. Let's see if the fun
continues. My only remaining ques-
tion is: Will we hear any echoes wak-

 ing ‘up or anybody shaking down

thunder from the sky?

jTng  News - September 6, 1985

Woods

continued from page 18 “' 
after Hugh Green, who some say is
the most dominating player ever to
play college ball. It is especially diffi-
cult when injuries keep you off the
field. Woods was hindered by a

' broken wrist in 1983 and various

injuries last season.

Now he is a junior, healthy and,
ready to wreak havoc on opposing
quarterbacks, much in the same way
that Hugh Green did. “I feel I have
the ability, that I can make the big
play, and if I’m rushing the quarter-
back, I think I can make something,
happen,” said Woods. '

Last year, the Panther defense
yielded more yards passing per game
than any other defense in Panther
history. Questions were raised about
the fate of the great Panther defense
of the past andsthe reckless abandon
that was its trademark.

Although Purdue tallied 464
yards of total offense, Woods
believes the defense is ready to
return to the glory days. “We have a
lot of enthusiasm and talent on
defense,” he said. “We're playing
more as a team. There are no stars,‘

which is good because it makes us

work even harder to try and make
the big plays.”

In case you see a big play made by
a No. 9 sometime in the near future,
that is freshman Darrel Woods,
Tony’s' younger brother. He also
plays the defensive end, or “drop
end,” as it is called at Pitt. He, too,
was compared to Hugh Green in
high school and is listed as one of the
top freshmen linebackers in the
country by Street and Smith.

Having two players on‘ defense
who were compared to Hugh Green
is a great way to return to the defen-
sive tradition that was missed lag)
year. Keep an eye on those nines.
