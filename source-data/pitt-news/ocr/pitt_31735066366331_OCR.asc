TWELVE IS A MAN Y-SPLEN DORED THING

Today I begin my twelfth year of writing this column in
your campus newspaper.
These dozen years have passed like a dozen minutes. In
fact, I would not believe so much time has gone by except
that I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I
started this column, she was a mere slip of a girl——supple as
a willow bough and fair as the mom. Today she is gnarled,
lump_y, and given to biting the postman. Still, I count my-
self lucky. Most of my,friends who were married at the same
time have wives who chase cars all day. I myself have never
had this trouble, and I attribute my good fortune to the
fact that I have never struck my wife with my hand. I have
always used a folded newspaper, even during the prolonged
newspaper strike of 1961 in New York. During this journal-
less period I had the airmail edition of the Manchester Guard-
ian ﬂown in daily from England. I must admit, however,
that it was not entirely satisfactory. The‘airmail edition of .
the Guardian is printed on paper so light and ﬂimsy that it

makes very little impression when one smacks one’s wife. '

Mine, in fact, thought it was some_ kind of game and tore
several pairs of my trousers. ’
But I digress. For twelve years, I say, I have been writ-

ing thiscolumn. That is a fact, and here is another: I shave-

every morning with Personna Stainless Steel Blades I bring
up Personna Stainless Steel Blades because this column is
sponsored by the makers of Personna and they are inclined
to brood if I omit to mention their products.

 
    

“ . . . only fleeting
enthusiasm among
the coaches.”

- .----  . ... -- . ' '

Not, let me hasten to state, that it is any chore for me to

, sing the praises of Personna—as you will agree once you try

this sharpest, smoothest—shaving, longest—1asting blade ever
devised by the makers of Personna Blades—now available
both in Double Edge and Injector style. Personna, always
the most rewarding of blades, today offers even an extra re-
ward—a chance to grab yourself a fistful of _$100 bills from
a $100,000 bowl! The Personna Stainless Steel Sweepstakes
is off and running, and you’re all eligible to enter._Visit your

friendly Personna dealer soon to pick up an entry blank.

(void where prohibited by law).

V And, by the way, while you’re at your friendly Personna
dealers, why don’t you ask for a can of Burma Shave? It
comes in Regular or Menthol; it soaks rings around any
other lather, and it's made by the makers of Personna.

But I digress. For twelve years, Ivsay, this column has
been discussing, forthrightly and fearlessly, such burning
campus questions as “Should students be allowed to attend
ﬁrst-hour classes in. pajamas?” and “Should deans be re-
tired at age, 25?” and “Should foreign exchange students be
held for ransom?”.

Today, continuing the tradition, we take up the thorniest
academic problem of all: the high cost of tuition. Let me
tell you how one student, Lintel-Sigafoos by name, solved
this problem. ’

Lintel, while still a boy in Straitened Circumstances, '

Idaho, had his heart set on college, but, alas, he couldn’t
afford the tuition. He applied for a Regents Scholarship
but, alas, his reading speed was not very rapid—only two
words an hour—and before he ﬁnished even the ﬁrst page
of his exam, the Regents had closed their briefcases crossly
and gone home. Lintel then applied for an athletic scholar-
ship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill——balancing
an ice cream cone on his chin-and this, alas, aroused only
ﬂeeting enthusiasm among the coaches.

And then he found the answer: he would get a student
loan! Of course, he would have to pay it back after gradua-
tion, but clever Lintel solved that, too: he kept changing
his major, never accumulating enough credits to graduate
until he was 65 years old. Then he repaid the loan out of his
Social Security.

Where there’s 31 will, there’s a way. _

Criticizes Dorm
League Coverage

Editor, The Pitt News:

In view of recent events, _we
-think it is about time certain
{things were called to the atten-
tioh of Frank Smizik concerning
the" coverage given the dorm
V“ league. during the past softball
eason.

 During the regular season, the
"coverage of dorm league softball
aried between non—existent and
Qtally inadequate. For example,
the -following headlines appeared
in the sports pages:

(The letter lists issues of The
Pitt News of Sept. 13, 15, 20, 22,
,- and 29, and Oct. 1, 13, and 15, in
“which coverage was given to fra-
N_e'rnity leagues only. It also cites
,“Sept. 27, ‘Keystone Beats Litch-
Nﬁeld in Dorm League Encounter’;
Keystone-—who are they?” and
‘J-~“O‘ct. 18 ‘Keystone Wins All-
“Campus Title/‘A’ League Champ,
‘Phi Ep, Second’ Keystone-—who
;-are they? All-campus champs,
‘that's who.”)

_ We don’t think that is parti-
ularly adequate coverage of a
eague that produced the all-cam-
us champions. We know also,
hat there is no more informa-
ion given to The Pitt News con-
cerning -fraternity league games
an concerning dorm league
ames.

Some other interesting notes-
he dorm league represents 1,300
men, the fraternity league rep-
esents about 800 men. There are
,300 male readers of The Pitt
ews in the dorms; perhaps they
reentitled to some information
oncerning their own league, too.
.. The ﬁnal indignity, however,
‘ ame Oct. 18. On page 6 of The
‘Pitt News, we read the headlines,
"_“Keystone Wins All-Campus Title/
?‘A’ League Champ, Phi Ep, Sec-
ond," but in the article itself Key-
.»— stone -had 18 lines .allot'ed to cover
éboth the semi-ﬁnal game against
the Counselors and the ﬁnal game
:-against the Phi Eps. ‘

, The Phi ‘Eps meanwhile, had
31 lines allotted in which they
{had virtually every bal1player’s
name mentioned at least once.
~ The PiKA’s, who weren't even

;and had most of their players’
[names mentioned as well.

1 There is no mention of how
”j:Keystone progressed through its
 dorm league games, -the
isemi-ﬁnal of the all-campus play-
foil! or the most important game
{of all, the ﬁnal against Chi Ep,
,«.-Coverage is given in detail, how-
,_'év_er, to the Phi Ep -PiLam and
:.PiKa-Fiji contests, games not
'_'.even involved in the all-campus
I lay-offs.

The problem now is not only when will the University get the appro-

Further conﬁrmation of this thesis is that the representatives of the

Such evidence of the self-centered orientation of the governing body
of this state is disheartening. Setting a precedent of neglecting responsi-

tunately, progressing towards that end.

Letters Against

Mitche1lContinue

Editor, The Pitt News:

As proud Americans, we were
shocked by the letter from Da-
vid Mitchell in The Pitt News of
Oct. 18. We feel that Mr. Mitchell
is right in that there is a “scare-
crow” hung around the necks of
“every campus . across the na-
tion.” We are ashamed that such
a scarecrow is necessary in order
to get Americans to serve their
country when they are needed.

Mr. Mitchell delights in com-
paring our military, governmenta.l
and judicial systems to those of
Nazi Germany. Yet if the similar-
ity was as close as he would have
us believe, he would not have
lived to write his letter after re-
fusing the draft and even if he
had written it no newspaper
would have been permitted to
print it.

Mr. Mitchell goes on to ask if
we are to begin a battle for his
beliefs or let it end. We say this:
in a democracy there is always a
battle. This battle is between the
different factions among the peo-
ple and is fought peacefully with-
in the limits of the law. It be-
gan with our Constitution and
will go on as long as our nation
continues. The next question is
gs ill-conceived as the ﬁrst. We
do not “heil" the judges, but we
do respect their positions. We do
hail peace and liberty, but more
important, we are willing to ﬁght
and die to preserve the liberty
which we posses in this country.
Peace and liberty do not always
go hand in hand as our own
Revolutionary War proved.

In closing, we wish to ques-
tion the disregard of Mr. Mitch-
ell and those who think as he
does for the Americans who will-

ingly gave thei,F' lives and are_

giving them now to uphold the
very system and principles which
he is so anxious to tear down.
We wonder if he would be equal-
ly as willing to give his life to
defend whatever principles he
holds dear, since he obviously
does not consider those of the

Editor, The Pitt News:

I can no longer sit back with-
out protesting against people like
David Mitchell, Letter/to the Edi-
tor, Pitt News. Oct. 18, being per-
mitted to use the-mass media as
sounding boards for their anti-
American, ‘unpatriotic and irre- .

vment they _want._,But this deci-

sponsible ramblings. Mitchell does
not represent the mainstream of

. American thought. The Pitt News

should be praised for showing
that the majority of Pitt stu-
dents do not support the sick
views of Mitchell and his cohorts.

Mitchell received justice. Wheth-
er he agrees with American for-
eign policy is “wholly irrelevant”

to.his trial. The Selective Serv- -

ice Act makes provisions for con-
scientious objectors. But true
paciﬁsm requires that one de-
nounce war in total. In other
words, a paciﬁst would say both
the United States and the Viet
Cong should withdraw from
South Vietnam.

The dirty, unshaven, sloppy pro
testors and pseudo - intellectuals
who cry out against American

' intervention and “aggression” are

either blind to the facts of will-
fully refuse to accept them. When
American troops used a harmless
tear gas to ﬂush the Viet Cong
out of peasant villages these great
humanitarians branded America
has a villian for using “poison
gas.” .
One week they protest against
“murder” but when steps are
taken to prevent ' the killing of
innocent citizens protests are
raised against the preventatives.
What do Mitchell and his cronies
want? Is a Communist take-over
their goal? Why don’t they pro-
test against thé Viet Cong who
murder the few Vietnamese offi-
cials and peasants who possess
the courage to openly support
Saigon?" After all, the command-
ment “thou shalt not kipp” ap-
plies to the Viet Cong as well.

Mitchell states “that the price’
of immunity is a ‘harnessed mind‘

and a gagged mouth." No one
asks that every American stand
up and say, “I’m 100 per cent for
American intervention.” Our
right to free speech is not only
protected by the Bill of Rights
but by a Supreme Court that per-
haps is over zealous in guarding
these rights. ,

Mitchell can say he opposes the
war until he runs out of breath.
I don't object to his having this
right. I wouldn't want this right
denied to Mitchell or to anyone
else. What I do object to is Mitch-
ell deliberately ﬂaunting the law.
I also object to his slurring the
honor of our nation by twisting
the truth until he has linked
American intervention with the
Nazi tactics of World War II. I
object to mass protests that can-

not change our present commit- ,

ments. These protests can only
encourage the Communists. Such
encouragement could lead to mis-
calculations of American determ-
inations to help the Vietnamese
win their battle of independence.

I am all in favor of allowing _
_,the Vietnamese to decide by

themselves the type of govern-

. Action want. But their irrespon-'

The

 

sion cannot be accomplished un-
til the Vietnamese are free from
intimidation from .any outside
force. The Communists are not
willing to leave the Vietnamese
alone. Even paciﬁst India learned
the Communists can't be trusted.

America has little choice, there-
fore, when a friend calls for help.
As much as we don’t like to see
our soldiers die on foreign soil it-
is better than waiting until there
is no foreign soil left on which
to ﬁght. By this statement I don’t
mean that war is okay-as long
as it doesn't effect the homeland.
I mean that the failure to support
other nations in their ﬁght
against a Communist takeover
can only lead to one nation af-
ter another falling under the
iron hand of Communism.

It is only under Communism
and Facism that “mouths are gag-
ged." Just as “no man is an is-
land,’’ no nation” is an island.
American ‘interests are as much
at stake in the future of Vietnanf
as Philadelphia’s. interests are
aﬂected by the growth and de-

- velopment of Pittsburgh. The

quickest way to end the war in
Viet-Nam is to show -A the world
we intend to ﬁght to the end. Un-
til we show the Communists we
are united in this objective the

' Communists will continue to un-

derestimate our committment
and the war will continue to
escalate. I doubt that is what
either_ Mitchell, the National Com-
mitteetoEnd the Warinvietnam,
or the Students for Democratic

sible actions are leading only to
futher escalation. If World War
III is around the comer, they are
marchingus closer to it.

Improve Writing
Senator Asks -

Editor, The Pitt News:
Responsible editorial writing is
the pride of every news editor in

the country. While this usual edi- r

tor combines fact with opinion
in a well-written report, this is
not so with our editor, Bill Cabin.
I speak of the editorial, “New
President Presides,” in the Oct.
18 issue of The Pitt News.

From observations, like “the
game was the same,” to well-
taken recommendations, like f‘the
removal of ignorance as a basis
for action,” the editor showed
his supreme facilities of composi-
tion and good planning of his
writing. On the one hand, he sug-
gested that each senator be pro-
vided with a book of Robert’s
Rules of Order;’ on the other
hand, he scoffed at Senator Rus-
kay’s use of the same book.

On a sly third hand, he criti-
cized the senators for not know-

 

ing all the particulars ofP‘arents’ \

Weekend and Homecoming. Are
the reports from the chairmen

‘of these events merely to show

each chairman's relative proﬁci-
ency in speech 80? These reports
are precisely designed to give
the senators the -information col-
lected by each committee.
Through these reports and‘ ask-
ing questions the senators are
made aware of. happenings.

Marsha Bernstein, chairman of
the senate (not vice-president,
Mr. Editor), was denounced for
her “parliamentary ignorance.”
While she was slow at ﬁrst, most
senators felt she did very well.
It was her ﬁrst experience in
leading the’ senate.

Mr. Cabin, this was not your
first experience in editorial writ-
ing, though it appeared so. It is
hoped that you improve——not
your opinion, which you are en-_
titled to publish-—but your skill
in writing and the degree of
exactness in presenting that opin- ,
ion.

v Two Local Professors
To Study in Antarctica

Dr. Helen McCammon, assistant professor of earth and
planetary sciences at the University, and Sister M. Maurice,
associate professorof biology at Mount Mercy, will be mem-

J I

bers this winter of the largest field party to ever explore

the continent of Antarctica.

They will leave Pittsburgh Nov. 9 or 10 to join some
35 other scientists from institutions all over the nation

aboard the ,Antarctic research
vessel, the Eltanin at Valpariso,
Chile. They will then travel to
63 degrees south latitude in An-
tartica to spend two months in
research and exploration

Dr. McCammon’s research, en-
titled “Articulate Brachiopods in
the Anarctic Region,” will in-
volve dragging under the water
serve as Dr. McCammon’s assis-
for bivalve marine invertebrates
currents. Sister M. Maurice will
to gain information on feeding
currents.

The research is being support-
ed by a grant from the National
Science Foundation, which funds
and coordinates the~U.S. Antarcti-
ca Research Program .(USAR.P).

Logistic support for USARP is
provided by the Naval Support
Force, Antarctica. The men, trans-
port vessels, icebreakers, and .air-
craft of the support force carry
out the transport of personnel,

resupply of provisions and fuel ‘

to’ permanent stations, and con-
struction and maintenance of
facilities. \

Among the research to be con-
ducted by USARP scientists will
be the completion of a projected

5,000 mile traverse across an un-
explored section of the continent,
a search for insects, exploration
and mapping of the geology of
mountains, measurement of the
éarth’s gravity and magnetism.

Pnthers Die Past Miami, 2814 I

Being Frank »
“IT’S ABOUT THVIE”

For the ﬁrst time in six weeks the Panthers played a
complete football game. The offensive unit displayed a po-
tent running game to complement the already established
passing game. The defense contained the Miami running
and passing attacks.

Experimentation and innovation are the reasons that
the gridders have started to look like a winning team. There
have been so many changes in the line—up since the begin-
ning of the season that the players need to carry a validated
invoice so the coaches can recognize them.

At defensive right cornerback three different men have
tried their luck. The third choice, Mickey Depp, proved the
third was the charm. He has picked off three passes in the
two starts he has made against Navy and Miami.

Josh Novogratz has taken over the middle linebacker
spot‘ and has strengthened the middle of the defense. Bill
Boucek and Tom Mitrakos have been switching at the right
line-backer position that Novogratz vacated.

Also a little more blitzing on the part of t-he linebackers
has kept the other teams off balance and has forced them ./
into making the same mistakes that the Panthers were being
forced into at the beginning of the season.

When the defense came to life against Navy the offen-
sive team might as well had not made the trip. But against
the Hurricanes they too found a running game and a new
offensive formation to work With.

» The running game was aided by the insertion of Tom
Crosby into the offensive line-up at left guard. Crosby
didn’t make the trip to Washington because his chronic bad
knees were bothering him. He played this week and the line

looked like an entirely different one.

Saturday’s 28-14 defeat of Miami might well be remembered as the Kenny Lucas

day by Panther fans. Awarded the game ball, the senior quarterback completed 11 of 15
passes for 208 yards.

l Against Navy Lucas was dumped behind the line for 87 yards by middle line-

backers. Miami’s defensive backs also managed to pressure him for losses totaling 31
yards. Yet in the two games he

The gridder offense outdis-
tanced Miami with 439 yards on
total offense compared to the
Hurricanes’ 168. accumulating 27
ﬁrst downs on the Way.

“We knew that if we were go-
ing to survive we’d have to be
really tough on defense,”' said
Tate. “We expected Lucas and
Crabtree but we never expected
their strength on the running

On a field too slippery to
score goals, the soccer team
reached a crucial point in the
season when they shutout
the Ohio University Bobcats,
2-0, at Athens, Ohio.

“This team came of age in this
game,” said coach Leo Bemis.
They’ve made the necessary ad-
justments to the positions weak-
ened by injuries, and they’ve ar-
rived at a degree of team work.
Since the loss to West Chester,
this is the ﬁrst game they’ve
played together as a single unit.”

Acting as one, the booters grab-
bed early control of the game,
And except for two oﬁensive
ﬂurries by Ohio in the third quar-
ter and in the opening minutes
of the contest, the soccermen
pressed the Bobcats throughout
the game. - '

With the wind blowing in their
faces, the booters couldn’t kick
the ball from in front of the goal
as Ohio U. applied pressure in
the ﬁrst minutes of play. The
Bobcats took four corner kicks,

The offensive line -play
caused Miami Coach ‘Charlie.
Tate to comment, “We got
killed by that interior line-
play of Pitt. We had reports
that they might be Weak on
the line, but they sure
weren’t, they murdered us.”

John Michelosen also add-
ed a little surprise to the of-
fense when he moved Eric

t. Crabtree into the set back
position and made Bob Lon-
go the flanker back. Bob
Rosborough and Mitch Zai-
nasky played the tight ends.

,_Michelosen used this forma-
tion to try -and get Longo
and Rosborough in the game,
at the same time.

“It worked pretty well for

5, us,” said Michelosen, “it im-
proves our passing game.”

but the defense held and stop-

In the same period, the soccer
team drew first blood. Sal Ta-
vares, taking a lead pass from
Dave Shaffer, drove by the Bob‘-
cat defender and ran the ball
right in the goal, shooting from
seven yards away. His second
goal of the season gave the soc-
cermen a 1-0 lead. As it turned

eluded Tavares, Shaffer, Ferd
Sauer, and Dom Milillo. “In this
one, I went with the best I had,
substituting only at the trailer
position (Milillo) with Pete Sny-
der or when a player was very
tired or hurt,” he said.

out, that was all they needed.
After Ohio found a breakdown
in the left side defense, they at-
tacked with a ﬂurry of succes-
sive shots, but Cal Bonawitz soon
took care of that, adding an in-
surance goal on a penalty kick.
Bonawitz received his chance
to score when Shaffer drove on

then from a prone position, man-
aged to do'a' split and kick the
ball into the nets. It would have
been a goal, but for the oppos-
ing fullback. He was ready for
anything but a kick along the
ground, and caught it’ with his
hands, .an illegal play for him.
