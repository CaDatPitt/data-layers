Gainan Demands
Shelters On Time

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Tom Gainan, the new president of the Commuter Associa-
tion (CA), intends to hold the administration to its promise to
erect two bus shelters for commuters by Feb. 8.

“If they’re not up by Feb. 8,” he vowed, “I’m going to take as many
people as possible up to see the administrator responsible.”

Gainan. who was elected president Friday after serving as vice-
president for a year. said Saturday he is tired of being "put off by the
administration." The normally mild-mannered junior from Brookline
confided. "I don't know what their next excuse is going to be. but were
just not going to listen anymore." .

Conceding that the administration has "good intentions." (lainan
nevertheless argued. “If they’re sincere. they'll get the shelters up on
time.

SOCIAL VISTAS

Gainan. whose proposals to improve the commuters lot run the
gamut from the cautious to the grandiose. is especially anxious to
broaden the scope of the commuters social opportunities on campus.

He intends to work in conjunction with Committees Commissioner
Wade Lawson to secure berths in the dorms for commuters. He con-
siders a $2, night charge for a room reasonable and thinks commuters
should have access to rooms on a quota basis.

Gainan also supports a suggestion made by Social Commissioner
Lenny Klavonic to determine commuter entertainment preferences.
“Many people feel that commuters generally have different musical
tastes than other students,” Gainan explained. “A proposed question-
naire on the back page of the Pitt News would find if this is true.”

Already. the CA has begun to cater to the social needs of commu-
ters. This Friday. the CA is sponsoring a mixer. to be held in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom from 8 p.m. to 12 midnight. Under the CA's aus’—
pices. movies will be shown in the Student Union Ballroom from 12 to
4 p.m. at regular intervals.

Strongly endorsing these steps. Gainan added that he favors an
“extra showing“ of movies sponsored by the Student Union Board at
4:30 p.m. He also argued that more prominent speakers should address
students dtiring the day rather than in the evening. for the convenience
of commuters,

PARKING PUZZLES

Although Gainan labeled Oaklands parking problem "practically
unsolvable." he suggested several possibilities to alleviate the com-
muters plight. ‘

“Once concrete proposal we’ve made,” Gainan said, “is that the
University or the CA take over parking lots that the University cur-
rently leases to private persons.”

He mentioned a lot leased by the Lniversity to John Katsur as one
which “commuters can probably’ operate at 5. cl".-::.per cost.“ The lease
to that lot. according to Gainan. expires sometime in April.

Unitl the construction of new buildings starts. the CA wants to use
Forbes Field for parking. Gainan intends to explore that possibility and
investigate chances for obtaining parking space behind Trees Hall.
Agreeing that the Trees Hall area is "dangerous." Gainan argued that.
if paved. enclosed. and guarded. it could become secure.

To assist commuters who park between Hillman Library and Car-
negie Library. the CA may issue red stickers to students who contribute
to a special fund. If Gainan can convince enough people to volunteer.
students may feed the expired meters of cars with red stickers. to save
commuters from duty—bound meter maids.

Though Gainan is distressed by the “bureaucratic mess he thinks
characterizes the administration, he does not expect to resort to vio-
lent tactics during the next year to obtain the CA’s goals.

"We've thought of everything from a stall—in to a park-in to a
block-in.“ he confided. "We‘ve also thought of putting um in parking
meters."

But Gainan feels such tactics could prove counterproductive.
Rather than run that risk. he plans on trying. in his own quiet. but per-
sistent way. to "get the commuter to feel he‘s part of this campus."

“We Want More Security”_.:

by MICHAEL SIMON

The pressing matter of security
enforcement in University dor-
mitories was discussed at a meet-
ing in Housing Director John
\'rana‘s office on Thursday by stu-
dents and administrators.

The problem of non-students
entering student residence halls
surfaced after several students
discovered that "virtually any-
one" could enter the Towers due
to "extremely sporadic" identifi-
cation checks at the various dor-
mitory entrances.

perience. Jan Miller. Tower C res-

vious tightening in security en-
forcement was needed.

Countering Miller, recently
elected Programming Commison-
er Dennis Concilla charged, “A
trend is developing; we go to the
administration and say we don't
want these restrictions; a month
later we go back and say we want
more protection.” Concilla im-
lied that since the beginning of
the year, security enforcement
has become alternately lax and
strict, due to student demands.

Weighing both points. Vrana ex-
plained to the students that "we
want to provide the security the
students want. however. a lot of
students are offended by tight en-
forcement of regulation.“ He add-
ed that regardless of what has
happened this term. the number
of robberies after 11 pm. has

main fault with today's public
school system is the great rigid-
ity. He condemned three obses-
sions: the petty rules. lesson
plans and the idea that children
should be motionless and quiet.
To illustrate the ridiculousness of
the three obsessions. Silberman
related how. when he was to pre-
sent his ideas on education to the
U.S. Senate. he was asked to keep
his verbal presentation down to 15
minutes. The reason given was

that after that amount of time the '

Senators would start to fidget.

Putting the blame of the fail-
ure of the schools on the institu-
tions themselves. Silberman em-
phasized that the teachers can be
victimized too. The terrific em-
phasis on discipline limits the
time spent on teaching and actual
learning. But he added. "The pub-
lic school system can be changed."

The main solution for getting
away from regimented schools,
the author suggested, is exempli-
fied in the new British informal
schools. The theory behind these
is that “childhood is a time to be
cherished, not a corridor to be
rushed through.” It has been
shown that education is more ef-
fective if the learner is interested
in what is being taught. Class-

Supporting Vrana. Campus Se-

amount of robberies or assaults:

lor of Student Affairs, offered his
help. “If you need funds,” he stat-
ed, “for more security guards, or
anything that would result in bet-
ter student safety, I will try to get
it for you.”

one of these newly oriented ‘

a science lesson at an experimen-

studying the human body and be-
came especially interested in the
processes of the brain. While‘ do-
ing further research in an en-
cyclopedia. they came across the
word "braille." This new intri-
gue led them further into the var-
ious aspects of blindness. Some of
the children were interested in
what it felt like to be blind and

went around for a day blindfolded; ,

some read about Helen Keller‘s
life; some researched the physio-'
logy of blindness; and some ‘won-

Teaching Innovation

\_-jillllllllllllllllllllllflllllIIllllIllllllllillllllllllIllllllllllIillllllllllllIllllllllIIIillllllllllfllllllllllllill

   

by CAROLE COVAL

Students. teachers and educators have many locales crammed
themselves into the double auditorium in David Lawrence Hall on Fri-
day to participate in Professor Stanley Shostak’s rendition of “Multi-
media“ in education.

The presentation was part of a weekend-long Encounter in Educa-
tion, sponsored by the Undergraduate Cabinet in Education here at Pitt.
As film. music. and strawberry incense flooded the senses. Shos-
tak explained how media. in many cases. could be used to teach more

i effectively.

Shostak feels that the educational aspect expands with multi-me-

\ dia. By seeing a picture of the Grand Canyon, for example, we can de-

cide for ourselves how we feel about space and closeness.

“How do you feel about status. population. sex. smoking. drugs and
violence?" he asked of the audience. “When you see it——it‘s a lot more

real. It becomes an experience.“

There is choice. too. in multi-media learning. With more than one

. film to watch while listening to music and the lecturer. a student can

choose to learn what is most important to him.

After the hour-long media-lecture, members of the audience
gathered in the lobby to discuss this alternative method of teaching.

Assistant Professor Donald Martin of the Education Department

‘here. expressed his astonishment at “the power that a media-lecturer

wields." "He is as authoritarian as the conventional teacher. but has
access to sbliminal suggestion. That is not to say this presentation was
ba." he said. "But that students should be made aware of the coercive
power of the media in ed-ucati_on—as we have been made aware of it in
television.  .

“I like to see people who are willing toinnovate." he said of Pro-
fessor Shostak. '

Herbert Schneider, an educator from Capital University, Colum-

, bus, Ohio, praised Shostak’s lecture as “solving two of the biggest prob-

lems in education. He alleviated boredom and the demands of class
structure,” he said. ‘

"Another teacher may not have had the personality to make the
media-lecture a success.“ he added. "Shostak is a good teacher be-
cause he had a bona fide viable strategy. but gave the students the free-
dom to learn.“

In the past year, 1,300
North Americans and Puerto
Ricans visited Cuba to work
.and experience life in a social-

‘ ist country. In mid-March of
‘this year a Fourth Brigade will
head South to help the Cuban
people harvest sugar cane.

The Advising Center an-
nounces that pre-Spring and

sessions will be held the week
of Feb. 8-I2. Registration for

Youth Is The   Victim

by SUE HOENSTINE

John Holt may have justified his
notion that "we shouldn't discrim-
inate because ofage" at an hour-
long discussion with local high
school students Thursday after-
noon.

Aftcr decrying the compulsory
nature of schools today. the 47-
year-old educator met with more
criticism from the "victims" of
the system he opposed than one
would have anticipated.

Holt opened the session by ques-
tioning the institution of child-
hood. "Someone invented the no-
tion that there are two kinds of
people—young and old.“ Holt be-
gan. "I think that there‘s some-
thing wrong when opportunities
are denied until a person becomes

-21.

Education can’t make sense un-
til it’s available to people when
and if they want it,” he contend-
ed. “The young aren’t stupid and
there's no connection between

(Continued from Page 1)

to do without. Much more money
is spent on the rich than on the
poor because they can stay in

school longer."

He went on to cite statistics
showing the uneven distribution
of educational funds between “the
favored and the unfavored.“ Irr
1969. $36 billion was spent on ele-
mentary and secondary education,
with the rich getting a larger
share of that amount. To have
provided these resources evenly
among the two groups. it would
have cost $80 billion.

The total education bill for the
same year, taking into account
college and university costs, was
$70 billion; distributed evenly it
would have come to $150 billion.

The projected figure for the
funding of elementary and sec-
ondary schools in 1975 is $45 bil-
lion: even distribution of re-
sources would boost the amount
to $105 billion.

Considering the above figures.
Holt commented. "By taking what

good school work and how well a
person can carry out responsibil-
ities in life.” With this, Holt an-
nounced an end to huslecture and
waited for discussion from the 40
members of his autidence.

A lanky black from Schenley
High School opposed Holt by point-
ing out that he needed a formal
education and a paper diploma to
prove his accomplishments before
he could enter society.

Holt nodded sympathetically

V and replied that the whole struc-

ture of society needed to be chang-
ed. “If entrance to life means a
$30.000 education. you‘re dis-
criminating against the poor. But
people like to learn. and I think
that the compulsory nature of
schools kills learning.“

Holt criticized the school-s for
discouraging innovation and stat-
ed, “When you’re locked in a
classroom, there is no need for
new ideas, because the teacher
knows that you have to sit there

  

  olt-"You Cold all It Jail”

was once an inexpensive and plen-
tiful resource. by locking up learn-
ing in the schools. we have creat-
ed a permanent gap between sup-
ply and demand.“

According to Holt‘, schools have
had three functions. “One we
might call in the best sense of
the word, education. It has some-
thing to do with human growth-
intellect, capability, and so forth,”
he said. “The second, if you want
to be polite, you could call custo-
dial. If you want to be impolite,
you could call it jail. Its purpose
is to keep young people out of so-
ciety.”

Holt felt that the second func-
tion was detrimental to educators
as well as students. “Because the
customer. so to speak. is in there
against his will. we cant get any
feedback.“ he commented. “We
cannot find out anything relevant
about students‘ needs unless they
are put in a situation wherethey
have a choice.”

The last function Holt termed
grading. labelling or channelling.
"Thisis the machine that stamps
you wi’nner or loser. It has created

“If you need a school with desks,
closed doors, and teachers who
tell yu to shutup, you can have it.
But students should also be able
to elect courses that interest
them, and the teacher should
and listen whether you’re inter-
ested in what’s being said or not.”

His opponent from Schenley
dubbed Holt “an extremist" and
mentioned subjects like math and
reading that are "boring but ne-
cessary for survival in a city cul-
ture." '

Before Holt could reply. a stu-
dent from Taylor Allderdice who
was in favor of destroying the
whole system. asked Holt how he
intended to change the schools.

Holt suggested a decentraliza-
tion of school systems and called
for a wide variety of local schools.

if he doesn’t relate to their needs.”

I One student criticized Holt for
oversimplifying the issue and de-
clared that he needed a teacher
who could give him facts. "If you
don't have any requirements.
you‘ll have all kinds of weired
teachers." the youth concluded.

Holt retored. "Well. it cant
make much difference- because
there are all kinds of weird things
going on in the schools now.

As he left Dining Room C. Holt
replied to a comment that youth
wasn‘t receptive -to change with
the‘words. “We accomplished a
lot today. once we worked off a lot
of rhetorical steam. And these
students. like anyone else. are

ner. there are 100 losers. We‘ve

out of the jail, labelling business.
If society wants jails for kids. let
it build them. Those of us concern-

t ed with education want no part of

this.“

Holt concluded withla condemn-I

ation of the “institution of child-
hood.” He described it as the idea

 

 

that humanity can be divided into 

two groups, adult and child, with
the latter going through many
stages before he can enter the
adult world.

As a tactical step to uniting the
two factions. Holt suggested that
“just as it has been made illegal
to discriminate against people be-
cause of race. religion and sex. I
propose to make it illegal to dis-
criminate against people on
grounds of age. The possibility of
young people participating seri-
ously in the world around them
can be the greatest magnet to
draw them to education. the most
powerful incentive. We have to do

away with the barriers between". a’

young people and membership in
the human race."

R A  “Report  of    thun‘e

by BOB GING
News Editor

(Editor's Note: This is the first
part of a series to be run in the Pitt
News, dealing with the “Report of
the Chancellor l970.” This report
is required annually by the Com-
monwealth under Pitt's state-re-
lated status, and is published in the
Winter issue of the Pitt alumnae
magazine.)

THE YEAR
IN PERSPECTIVE: THE
CHAN CELLOR 1970

“In the decade of the 1960’s,
the University of Pittsburgh
accelerated its movement to-
ward academic excellence and
reached new levels of quality
in most programs. In the de-
cade of the 1970’s, the Univer-
sity’s highest priorities must
include the continuation of this
thrust in the development and
expansion of high quality un-
dergraduate. graduate and
professional education and in
the stimulation of research.

“When I came to the Uni-
versity of‘ Pittsburgh three
and a half years ago, I predict-
ed that the American universi-
ty would undergo reorienta-
tion toward greater public
service in the coming decade.
I also suggested that the»uni—
versity would acquire a higher
order of public responsibility,
that it would become a crea-
tive center for a new society—
for its communication sys-
tems, its social patterns and
its economic and political
structures. The University
has added to its list of high
priority objectives a new di-
mension to accompany its en-
ergetic drive for quality in ed-
ucational and research activ-
ities. This.includes humanizing
and making more habitable the

 

 

urban environment» and pro-
viding opportunities for con-
tinuing the education for an
ever-widening array of people.

“As this report will illus-
trate, the University of Pitts-
burgh is adapting its curricula

to the needs of contemporary
society. It has moved innova-
tively, and its teachers and
researchers are increasingly
relating their efforts to the
resolution of problems of so-
cial injustice, poverty, urban
blight, the impact of techno-
logy on society, and the threat
to peace in international po-
litics. .

“The University of Pitts-
burg is, therefore, continuing.
in its traditional mission in
education and simultaneously
is expanding commitments
and services to the commun-
ity.” (Introduction, Report of
the Chancellor 1970. )»

LOOKING BACKWARD
In his annual address to mem-
bers of the University commun-
ity. Chancellor Posvar points out
the many changes which the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh has under-
gone in the past year. In the area
of specific developments. he
cites: “a study in depth of univer-
sity governance . . .2
examination and restatement of
our student publication policies
. . . by a committee of outside ex-

perts: a ‘New Careers Program
for bringing human service pro-
fessional workers up to the bac-
calaureate level . . .: a study of an
appropriate future for ROTC . . .-
by a committee of the Faculty of
Arts.and Sciences: and new curri-
cula and_more flexible methods of
instruction which were adopted
in several schools." ‘

Among the many curriculum
changes which the Chancellor re-

fers to, are the new credit/no en? i

try system of evaluation, and the
leniency of many departments in
allowing the student to apply
this system of evaluation to his
major. Upperclassmen may re-

a thorough '

 

member. that as little as three
years ago, all courses were
evaluated on a strict letter grade
basis, and requirements such as
two terms of physical education,
four terms of language, and 15
creditsin each distribution of
studies field sharply limited
many of the opportunities of a
Liberal Arts Education which are
now available.

COMMUNITY AND
STUDENT UNREST

“The year." Posvar explains.
"was also marked by a few inci-
dents of unrest“, He mentions
the dispute between the Univer-
sity and “residential neighbors“
concerning plans for the new
Chemistry Building. Modifica-
tions of the architectural design
of the building so that it would set
farther from the street settled the
dispute.

Other conflicts which the Chan-
cellor addressed himself to in-
cluded: ‘ ’

—Labor disputes and collective
bargaining. where the Universi-
ty “took a public position sym-
pathetic to the principles of col-
lective bargaining and elections
as a basis for determining who
should act as employee agents.
and these principles were later
affirmed for hospital and other
public service employees in a
new state law."

“Concern on the part of some
students and faculty about the

role of the Board of Trustees ‘‘

and suggestions that its pro-
ceedings be made public." Pos-
var declares, however,-, that it
is a “little understood fact that
there had already been faculty
and student observers at our

 Monday, February 1;, i97i4—rHEP1T'r NEWS-—i>alg¢3  

Ilor I970”

Trustee meetings. The holding

of open hearings by trusteesg
the public reporting of their dis- -
cussions and the reaffirmation,
-that minutes of their meetings,
are in the public domain helped-f

also to meet this concern."

—-The appearance of the national ;
women‘s liberation movement;
on campus. as a result of which‘-
"we have now a very active"

group seeking improved em-
ployment conditions.‘ and oppor-

tunities for woman in the Uni-f
versity. Before and since these”
demands were made. we haves:
undertaken serious efforts toe:
improve our practices in the

employment of minority per-
sons and women.“ '

“In dealing with such matters,” a
the Chancellor stated, “we have
firmly adhered to the principle,

of free expression by all mem-
bers of the university community
—however, foolish, erroneus or

unpleasant their views might. be—.— A
but we have held, too, that the»
limits of dissent would be reach-*
ed if the orderly processes of the]
university and the rights of its;_
members to teach and learn were ‘

infringed.”

SEATO was the U.S. answer to
the prohibition on military alli-
ances for either of the two zones
of Vietnam. In total violation of
the Genevaaccords. SEATO re-
flected the American commit-
ment to underwrite a separate
state in the southern half of Viet-
nam. According to Dulles.
“SEATO’s principal purpose was
to provide our President legal au-
thority to intervene in Indo-
china."

-In 1955. elections were held in
the south between Bao Dai. the
former colonial administrator of
Japan and Ngo Dinh Diem. a’ per-
sonal friend of Cardinal Francis
Spellman. The election were so
rigged with U.S. aid that Diem ‘got
605,025 votes‘ in Saigon from a
voters registration listof 450.000.

UNLIKE so many other Vietna-
mese, Diem never actually oppos-
ed French colonialism. By Man-
darin background. personal in-
clination and training Diem was a
member of Vietnams feudal aris-
tocracv. He firmly believed in the
Vietnames monarch, but, was as
well a Catholic. Under the French
rule. Diem rose to the rank of
governor of Phan Thiet province.

Because of widespread support
for the Viet Minh in the country-
side. Diem had but two groups to
turn to for support in Vietnam to
supplement U.S. aid of $250 mil-
lion a year. The first was the

To many religion was and still
is merely an opiate for the poor
and oppressed. and young black
people are rejecting such depres-
sants for dealings in reality. Al-
though in fact it may be true that
twisted religion is a type of drug
to pacify and oppress, could it not

» have the capability of straighten-

ing itself out and becoming a
stimulant? Let us look at the im-
plications of such a thought.

RACISM is a form of hatred.
Modern psychology upholds that
hate corrodes the mind. When a
mind undergoes disintegration.
the individual becomes incapable
of rational thought and is deemed
insane by society.

Lets imagine that all whites in
this country are racist—that they

have hated the black man for so

long that they have become in-

« sane; they are, however, incap-

able of realizing theirinsanity.

having a monopoly on that power‘

to define.

Imagine that in the beginning-
before the derangement——whites
desired the African laborer to up-
hold their economic base. In order
to maintain these black “mules,”
they fed mind distorted religion—-
and this religion became a part of
the black man—and he indeed be-
came passive—and the white man
snickered . . . ’

large landowners of the Mekong
Delta. With their support his
much lauded "land reform." de-
signed by U.S. advisors. is under-
standable. The government re-
forms reduced rents which rees-
tablished estates which the Viet
Minh had broken up. The result
of such an agrarian program were
hardly popular in the countryside.

’ The second group Diem looked

"toward was-the Catholics. A min-

ority of the population in primari-
ly Buddhist Vietnam. they held a
privileged position under ‘the
French. Catholics were exempt-
ed from military service and of-
fered tax relief. The Catholic pop-
ulation tripled in the South to sev-
en per cent with the flight of 880.-
000 from the North in 4954-55. Ac-
cording to French scholar Bern-
ard Fall (a military man who sup-
ported U.S. victory). “the mass
flight was admittedly the result of
an extremely intensive. well con-
ducted. and. in terms of its objec-
tive. very successful American
psychological warfare operation.“

WITH massive resentment to
the regime. Diem with U.S. sup-
port. had no choice but to cancel
the elections of 1956. called for in
the Geneva accords. As President
Eisenhower stated ‘in his mem-
oirs. Mandate for Change, “I have

REMEMBER were the words
of that historian who noted. “The
bee fertilizes the flower it robs.“
For you see the white man didn‘t
distort the religion enough allow-
ing enough of its intrinsic good to
become incorporated into the
souls of us black folk. The reli-
gion than began to untwist inside
of the black man and to simul-
taneously distort in the corroding
white mind. thus. today. the white
man is insane and we are well.

Now. no doubt. there exist mili-
tant factions in our nation who
will cry. “If theyare insane. we
must give them a shock treatment
and bring them back to reality!“
But they would be wrong on two
counts: 1) they obviously haven‘t
learned the "lesson" and will
simply catch themselves in the
trap—-and, 2) shock won‘t restore
a deteriorate the mind even more.
and the repercussions may des-
troy us all. Our only alternative
would instead be to employ. the
healing righteousness of love and
understanding to restore the men-
tal health of these our enemies . . .

really that much more difficult
for us to rationalize ourwlives to a

agree that had elections been held

as of the time of the fighting, pos- I

sibly 80 per cent of the population
would have voted for the Com-
munist Ho Chi Minh as their lead-
er rather than chief of state Bao
Dai.“ Ho asked for internationally
supervised elections in 1956 but
Diem refused.

Having no support among the

peasantry. Diem abolished the
elected councils which ruled the
villages in South Vietnam in the
summer of 1956. Councils were
replaced with officials appointed
by his provincial governors thus
abolishing theautonomy of the
2.560 villages in the South.

In 1959. Diem introduced a
new. fairly sophisticated system
of f‘relocation centers“ for the
peasants. These centers were
called "agrovilles"—a pre-1954
French term. (They. failing. were
superseded in 1961 by “strategic
hamlets" and in 1964 by “new
life hamlets"). Under the agro-
ville program. new rural villages.
built by forced labor.vwere sur-

 

rounded by barbed wire fences
and spiked moats to make them
militarily and politically impreg-
nable. They bore, as U.S. officials
came to concede, a strange simi-
larity to “concentration camps."
By 1963. eight million villagers
were living in the descendants of
the original agrovilles. »

YET, this sort of policy could
not solve Diem’s problems. With
U.S. financing and advisors, Diem
was forced to launch a system of
police terrorism and repression
against rural Vietnam. These
were not just aimed at Viet Minh
but nearly all Vietnamese who had
actively opposed French rule
were now declared enemies of
the state. Seventy five thousand

or more people were killed in the '

campaign. As many or more were
incarcerated in concentration
camps in whichstarvation, blind-
ing and maiming were common-
place. i

The U.S. was footing the bills
to protect “freedom. “

Search f0!‘ la TOk8I'l H   ACE Ratings Dist

by BARRY J. SHLACHTEIR

Walking home late Saturday night I came up to four or five peo-
ple wfth their backs bent low walking up and down on the snow-
covered sidewalks. “Are you looking for a contact lense?" I asked.

The girl in a long navy coat turned away, making me feel like
it was a ridiculous question to be asking. It didseem like a ridicu-
lous question, come to think of it. “She lost her ring". another girl
softly confided to me. “Its somewhere in the snow." ”

Bent over like a chicken pecking at grain, I shuffled back and

' forth over the frozen sidewalks. Running my foot gently over the

sparkling snow, I, too, was drawn into the search for the lost ring.
To the person who took me into her confidence-I asked what sort of
a ring it was. Saphire with two diamonds, I was -told.

Lights from two automobiles lit up the glistening snows. One
fellow was ‘bent over with a window scraper and a flashlight poking
and jabbing as he walked. “Let’s go home. C'mon. let‘s get outta
here”, he kept saying to the girl in the long blue coat.- ’

“I’ve got to find that ring.lI just got to find that ring". she
would answer him each time, clearly saying each syllable distinct-
ly. This is all that she said. Her nose‘ was a bright crimson which

‘ appeared to be well scrubbed and reflecting the flashes from her

tear-streaked eyes.

How did she lose it, I asked to the one girl who answered me.
“She threw it. I’m not kidding. She wanted to break up and just
threw it. I don’t know why she just didn’t hand it to him. That‘s
the price you pay for being dramatic.”

The ringless girl’s boyfriend kept asking to go home, everyone
was cold and, besides, it wasn’t that important. And each time she
answered the same way, “I’ve got to find that ring."

Kneeling on the cold ground she sifted the snow with her
woolen mittens. She half crawled under a parked Mustang in an at-
tempt to catch sight of her lost ring that was worth $60. It was worth
only $60, “but to him that’s a lot of money“, she told me.

For nearly thirty minutes in the freezing weatherwe searched.
and searched in vain. Therewas no sign of the ring anywhere. The
girl tossed a penny as she had thrown the ring to see how it would
land. Neither did this help.

Putting his flashlight into his jacket pocket, the boyfriend walk-
ed to where she kneeled. As he placed his gloveless hand on the
side of her head he said it was all right, it didn’t matter that much.
She put her arm around his waist and. slowly rose and they walked
together to his parked sedan.

By now. most newspapers (in-
cluding the Pitt News) has noted
that the American Council on
Education has released a report
called “A Rating of Graduate
Programs". Now that the readers
of the report have found out that
Yale's political science depart-
ment is “rated first” and that
Harvard is “rated second“ in
that field. it is time to look at
the meaning of the ACE ratings.

We must look at how the rat-
ings were obtained, and at the
validity of these methods. be-
cause the results are only as
good as the methods used to ob-
tain them. Only one form of data
was used to determine these rat-
ings. the opinions of professors
across the country. Selected pro-
fessors were sent questionnaires
by mail, in which they were ask-
ed to rate the various graduate
school departments in the na-
tion dealing with their specialty.

- All of the opinions were col-

lected in 1968. the composite
opinions being published this
year. Since the opinions were

in numerical form (with the pro- -

fessors assigning more points to
better schools on a scale of
1-5), they could be averaged,
and a “general" opinion became
the basis for the ratings.

Bill Keefe (of Political Sci-
ence) pointed out that all of the
opinions used in the report are
now at least two‘ years old. He
felt that many departments are
in such a state of flux that even
current opinions are innaccurate,
based on past realities rather
than present ones. This report,
then, is based on two year old
opinions that may have been
outdated when they were_ given.

Richard McCoy. director of

 

graduate programs in Pitt's Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences, feels
that professors are harassed by

an overflow of questionnaires‘

from various sources. If a pro-
fessor ignores a questionnaire
he is often "badgered” by fol-
low-up letters reminding him to
fill out a form, and McCoy has
observed that one tends to fill
out forms hastily to get them out
of the way. Such hasty perfor-
mances, he explained, can result
in very inaccurate information.

There may be an even more
important flaw in the method of
rating used by ACE. A profes-
sor's job, after all. is to learn
about political science, or his-
tory, or biology, not about the
strengths and weaknesses of

graduate schools across the na-

tion.
Keefe pointed out that the pro-

-fessors who answered these ques-

tions rated only the quality of
the faculty in the departments,
and were generally not know-
ledgeable about things like cur-
riculum and availability of pro-
fessors in a given department.

Even in the rating of faculty.
he added, their knowledge was
restricted to the established pro-
fessors who had been produc-
ing research papers and -books
over a number of years. Young
professors. even if they are intel-
ligent and creative, are not, on
the whole, nationally known.

From these ideas, I have form-
ed a general picture of the pos-
sible bias of the report. It seems
to favor older, well known de-
partments with established pro-
fessors over young, innovative
departments in which the pro-
fessors may spend more of their
time with the students. There is
a time lag aspect to the report
so that departments that recent-

low. ‘

The avowed purpose of the re“
port is to “. . .protect the po-
tential consumer of graduate ed-
ucation from inadequate pro-*
grams.” But Mr. McCoy) met
someone at a recent national .
meeting if the Council of -Grad-T
uate Schools who knew of a de-
partment that was rated by the
report that had not been in ex.-*
istance for two years!

Sam Hays, of History, and
Harry Avery, of classics, how,-'
ever, felt that reports of this na-
ture could have another potential J
use. They both felt that the view-»
points of “outsiders" could give ',
a department perspective on its
own strengths and weaknesses fl
relative to other departments in ,
the country, and help the de
partment to avoid a self-satis
fied attitude. ' ‘

All of the above mentioned ex
cept McCoy felt that undergrad-,
uate students looking for graduate}-
schools wouldn’t pay much at
tention to the report, but would
be guided by the recommenda‘

 

faculty. If this is true the -report;
will not have much effect. But;
McCoy felt that both good stu- V
dents and monetary grants might I
be diverted from schools with”
low ratings. All agree that this”
would be unfortunate if it oc-
curred, considering the limita
tions of the report. ‘
I It would seem to this report
er, that while both processes
build up a given department,‘
the second way contributes
more to education as a whole. If
reports like “A Rating of Gradu
ate Programs"»were to become
too important, they might distort f
the real values of education. A

MARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH will bring the third
financial crisis that‘ this institution has experienced in recent years. What
steps can the Union take to avert a situation which is potentially dangerous
for theteaching programs, for the staff, for library resources, and in gen-
eral for the continued functioning of the University?

The next general membership meeting is for the purpose of discuss-
ing the issues which face us as a result of the impending financial crisis and
of planning for union action.

IT IS URGENT FOR US TO EXAMINE BUDGETARY PRIORITIES
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

1; BUILDINGS OR PEOPLE?

Can we justify the amount of ‘money being appropriated for large
building programs when the University must let crucial academic pro-
grams suffer because of lack of funding?

2. ACADEMIC PROGRAMS

There are inadequate funds to reinforce existing programs, create
necessary new programs, or to provide adequate staff for either existing
or new programs.

3. JOB SECURITY AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM

When budgets are cut, it is the pattern today in universities that the
most expendable—those fired first-—are junior faculty and graduate assis-
tants. Both political dissenters and educational innovators belong mainly
to the junior ranks, and, therefore, are the first to suffer. In view of news

from colleges and universities across the country, we can anticipate, as a D

result of the budget crisis a freeze on salaries (especially for pedagogical
and political nonconformists), refusals to renew the contracts of those in
junior ranks, reduction in the number of graduate assistants, and retarda-
tion of the tenure processes. ‘

4. JOB DISCRIMINATION
How can the University live up to its commitment to women and ra-
cial minorities unless it reorders its financial priorities?

5. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES ,

Perhaps the most dramatic example of the consequences of mis- 1

placed priorities has been the fantastic reduction of the libraries’ book pur-
chasing budget this past year. The lasting consequences of this for the
scholarly excellent of the University are incalculable. Is money really.

this tight or is the library merely an easy cut-back target?

WHAT ROLE CAN THE UNION PLAY IN RESOLVING
THESE PROBLEMS?

WHO APPLIES PRESSURE?
TO WHOM IS IT APPLIED? i
ON WHAT OCCASIONS AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES?

These are the issues to which we will address ourselves at the next
general meeting of the union, where we hope to see all of you. '

—THE POLICY COMMITTEE

We urge those departments who have not yet had caucuses to meet,
discuss the issues, and elect representatives to the Council. «

who it is before you open your door. If the police want to question
you, they do not need a warrant. Police, however, do need a search
warrant to search either the premises or you. In some cases, where
there is substantial reason to believe that the resident will leave

out a warrant. This power was granted under the jurisdiction of pre-

The police can also invoke what iscalled the “Stop and Frisk"
law which allows an officer to stop- you and to search you if he-‘
suspects or has probable cause to suspect that you have already com- -

cause to suspect that you are carrying a weapon thereby putting
both himself and the community in immediate danger. If you're
carrying illegal contraband or drugs the officer must say that he saw
you in possession of them or saw you drop them, which is the most
prevalent case. Try to always have a witness with you to insure that
your rights are protected.

pect of the crisis. “I would like
the record,” he says, “to show
that this financial crisis for the
University had one very gratify-
ing aspect. This was the united
response of students, faculty,
staff, alumni, and trustees in
support of the University before
the public and the legislature.
(During the height of the crisis,
one student leader with unusual-
ly long hair told a University of-
ficial that he would even get a
haircut if that would help.)

"On the part of students and
faculty it was a display of loyalty
and intelligent persuasion that
elicited high praise from legisla-
tive leaders and even produced

some worthwhile side effects ed?

ucationally."

CRISIS 1970-1971

Although the financial crisis is
past, Posvar warns that it was by
no means t-he last financial com-
plication which the University
must face. “In fiscal year 1970-
71 we again face financial uncer-
tainty. since the state has made
only a stop-gap appropriation. We
are sustained by the expectation
that this year the state govern-
ment will find a sensible way to
finance the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (ourselves includ-
ed). Meanwhile. we had to raise
tuition again. which is now at

     
 
        
   

 

$850 for two terms. The state-re-
lated universities of Pennsylvania
now lead virtually all other large
public universities in the United
States in their high level of tuition
—not the sort of distinction we
welcome."
CRISIS FOR THE FUTURE

Although he concerns himself
mostly with the Lniversity in ret-
rospect. Posvar also assumes the
role of the visionary and projects
his not.ions of the future of high-
er education. He contends that
"there are two potential crises in
higher education. He contends
that “there are two potential cri-
ses in higher education: one is a
crisis in long-term funding. and
the other is a crisis of public con-
fidence. While I remain optimistic
about our ability to find solutions.
both of these crises pose a threat
to the continued existence of
many institutions and also to de-
gree of autonomy and academic
freedom of those that do survive. "

Posvar asserts that the capaci-
ty of both public and private
sources of support for higher edu-

. cation will be strained, as costs

continue to spiral upward. Point-
ing to the continued increase in
the number of students seeking a
higher education, he adds that
“unless more adequate funding ar-
rangements are provided, involv-
ing increases in both private giv-
ing and public support, the out-
come can only be a serious cur-
tailment in the higher educational
mission——measure in the harsh
terms of reduction of programs
and services.”

While Posvar believes that the
funding crisis is due primarily to
the increased costs of education.
there is another aspect which
contributes to the financial prob-
lems incrued by the University.
He states that f‘higher education
also suffers under another handi-
cap that is compounding the -fin
ancial problem. and that is a cri

ses in public confidence in higher 
education as a whole. the result 3

largely of public reaction to carn-
pus unrest.“

"Despite the fact. however.
that most institutions of higher
education have been. like Pitt. vir-
tually free of disruption. doubt
has been cast upon the ability of
even the most orderly institutions
to govern themselves. The uni-
versity rather that bridging the
generation gap has become a tar-
get that draws fire from both
sides. While some students view
the University as a tool of the 
tablishment." some citizens out-
side the university view that

perceptions are inaccurate. mis-
leading and dangerous. "

THE THREAT T0
ACADEMIC FREEDOM

“In the future.“ Posvar con-

cludes. "the most extreme danger

1 to higher education lies in the
threat to academic freedom. The

threat comes from without and
w-ithin—angry external demands
that voices of professors and stu-
dents expressing unpopular views
be silenced: internal campus
movements that would seek to in-
timidate faculty and student col-
leagues and make them conform
to group viewpoints on political
issues. If academic freedom is
lost as a result of submission to
either of these external or intern-
al pressures the system of higher
education that is the key to our
progress as a free society will
exist no longer. In its stead. our
institutions will become no more
than great vocational academies.

over such a development at Pitt.
As Chancellor. I intend, to the ut-

Paul Taylor Company

"Food For the Eyes”

by CINDY MORGAN
ASST. ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR

-Judith Dayken, with short-clipped blonde hair and a black pant-
suit stepped to the microphone at Trees Hall Dance Studio Thurs-

day evening and introduced herself as Paul Taylor.

The production manager continued by saying that Taylor.
choreographer and dancer in his small world-famous modern dance
troupe, tore some ligaments on a Chicago floor which she later des-
cribed as “one great big splinter." As a result, Taylor did not ap-

‘E . pear with his company in Pittsburgh.

Eight other members of the troupe presented a lecture-demon-
stration that evening, a series of standing and walking exercises and
excerpts from the Paul Taylor Company repertoire. interspersed

with Dayken comments on the dance in general.

The music with which the company began their warm-up exer-
cises, termed by Dayken as “fundamental as coffee to the dancer”,

was pre-recorded by Gwen Watson in New York, a known cellist.

During the excercises she commented favorably on the Trees
Hall dance floor. The floor is built on several tiers allowing some

“give" to the boards when the dancer performs on them.

On dance floors in general. Dayken expossed the wish that
“more people would regard the condition of the floor so dancers
don’t break their necks. literally their legs. Often architecture is for-
gotten, and the artist is lost in the shuffle in an attempt to please

future patrons.“

Six excerpts from whole dances were then presented to the au-
dience by first showing basic parts or steps in the dance, then show-

ing the total finished piece of choreography.

The first selection was Oriole with music written by Handel.
Only several minutes of this half-hour piece were displayed. (It

will later be shown in New York.)

Following the variety of movement in Junction came Post Mer-
idian, both with music by Bach. The latter dance in adaggio move-

“Tvment is normally done to an electronic score. Here Dayken inserted

“Unlike ballet. the modern dance choreographer is free to invent

with his music and contrast ideas as they suit.“

From a collection entitled Piece Period came the Hand Dance.
The dance was powerfully characterized by the expressive use of

the arms and hands.

The Greening of America,
Charles A. Reich,
Random House, $7.95.

There have been the Mores
and the St. Augustines and the
Karl Marxs. They saw man's ills
and presented plans for mans sal-
vation. Someone has always been
able to come up with the leuslve
answer to it all. the solution. the
final word.

And each time. history keeps
rolling on without much improve-
ment. The question is. how much
of its own inhumanity can the
poor human race take? And what
of the RollonMays. the R.D.
Laings, the Herb Maruces . . . .2’
Who will set us straight this
time?

Charles Reich has written an
important book, The Greening
of America (the saving, the con-
structive solution to the present
mess, so to speak) about the com-
ing American Revolution. In his
own words,” it will not be like
revolutions of the past. It will
originate with the individual and
with culture, and it will change
the political structure only as its
final act. It will not require vio-

' lence to succeed and it cannot be

successfully resisted by (vio-
lence. This is the revolution of
the new generation.” Very inter-
esting.

According to Reich, American
men can be broken down into
three levels of Consciousness:

Consciousness I: The hardy in-
dividual, the every man for him-
self type, the blue collar worker-
professionally self employed man,
the last of the pioneers, repub-
licans, “farmers, gangsters and
just plain folks.” ‘Pre-corpora-
tion man.

Consciousness II: Liberals;
educated professionals, middle-
class, labor union leaders, Gene
McCarthey supporters, old line
leftists, the Kennedys, supporters
of reform, status quo preservers,
culturati. Corporate man.

Consciousness III: The liberat-
ed ones, free wheeling. free liv-
ing, un-hung up, un-up tight. un-

encumbered, YOUTH, experience

Monday, February 1, 1971—THE PITT NEWS—Page_ 7
When the Revolution Comes

Peace Mrrrchers or Headlights?

mongers. anti-society rebels.
former beatniks. future hippies.
converted football players. long
hair wearers. Post corporate
man.

Reich thinks that Conscious-
ness III will preserve or Green
America. one way or the other.
taking the punch out of the profit
motive. destroying the vicious
producer-consumer circle. making
ecology. peace. love. beauty the
things they are supposed to be
and not secondary and meaning-
less servants of the corporate
state like they are now.

According to Reich, none of
this can come about until the in-
dividual has gotten his own
“head” together, and then gets
his friends together’. The revolu-
tion has to come from, through
and out of the individual, the lib-
erated individual. Mass move-
ments, mass revolt, mass reform
all are doomed to failure.

Book

 R 9 v ie 

He has a valid point, After
the terror of the Chicago conven-
tion, the Orangeburgs, the Chi-
cago Eights, the Pittsburgh sev-
ens, the system keeps lumbering
on, scared but undaunted by
these events. Reich’s theory that
individual revolution is what is
needed is not new; the publica-
tion of the book is.

Yet there are some serious flaws
in this book. Although his analy-
sis of the pre-liberated genera-
tion era is well done. Reich falls

 

 

slightly in his rapturous portray-S

al of the new-generation. He may
be too close. too involved to see
things objectively. (He himself
maintains that the new conscious-
nessiis ever changing and radi-
cally new.)

He is just too damn optimistic,
describing the “happy voices”
and cooperation of youth that he
characterizes in the “mutual

flashing of V signs. You can al-

  Free

most see the far off look in his
eyes, the optimists vision of a
beautiful future yet to be.

Who‘s to say that you can very
neatly classify man into three ca-
tagories? Is there no such thing
in America as an educated mill
worker. an honest business man
or for that matter. a dishonest
hippie? Are the turned on record
company execs all philanthropic
peace and love? There are too
many generalizations in this
book, the seperation is too neatly
done. It‘s not all that simple.

If there were a person who had
all the answers he‘d probably
keep them to himself. There has
to be someone who thinks he
knows how to save America;
there are enough of them alrea-
dy_ and there has to be someone
topresent the most important
idea of this book: the getting of
thy head together.

Reich maintains that the pre-
sent economic system would be
retained with some revisions,
mainly in the feeling with which
its members approach their. tasks.
Yet he clearly shows that the sys-
tem is almost impossibly diffi-
cult to change or improve.

His revolution would be inside
the system, inside the society,
inside the heads of those who
run the society. The ultimate
question, then, is whether it can
still function with different peo-
ple at its head, and whether the
-system is still human enough to
be controled by humans.

According to Reich, this growth
of consciousness III has been a
natural and irreversible out-
growth of technology. For tech-
nology provides the free time
for this sort of thought. There
may be, in Reich's opinion, con-
sciousness’s IV‘s, V5 and VI’s.

The point is that there is an un-
dercurrent of thought, of philo-
sophical development, moving
slowly in some direction as un-

predictable as life itself. The
consciousness III movement,
born out of another level of

thought is now endowed with

Taylor Troupe Presents

Lecture, Demonstration
"(Continued from Page 7)

Men’s Trio from Churchyard was followed by the last dance’

on _the program Orbs, done to a score by Beethovan. At one time.
commented Dayken, “Itwas sacriligious to choreograph anything to
his music, and in some parts of the world some people still think
this way. However I think they augment each other quite nicely.”

This dance was used to illustrate the use of entrances and exits.
The dance kept up a phrenetic pace as the dancers portrayed es—
cape from the sun.

Paul Taylor’s Company is presently on a six-month tour. Their
tours encompass not only the United States, but also Europe, Asia,
and South America.

Is the company hampered into a tight situation without Taylor
functioning in their performances? According to Dayken, “The
brilliance and genius of Paul Taylor's choreography is that any
member can take over for another. or perhaps a solo part can be
omitted entirely."

Presently Dan Williams of the company, who has previously
alternated parts with Taylor. is taking over some of his roles.

The company was questioned if their was greater response
developing to the dance, and they related, “American people are
not used to getting out and seeing something live, although the au-
diences are growing. Today as soon as you do something they find a
way to film it and can it.”

This reaction aptly fit with Taylor‘s expression, “Dance is to be
seen. It is food for the eye.“

If you missed the lecture—demonstration, or the performance at
Syria Mosque Saturday night, you indeed missed some forceful and
worthwhile “food" performed by a capable and exciting company.

the task of trying to control what
inexplicably led to its birth.

Perhaps the Consciousness of
Charles Reich, his solution, is
already old hat. If Woodstock is
seen as a representation of Con-
sciousness III then what was Al-
tamount? Consciousness IV‘? The
cooperation, the beauty, love and
hope that Reich presents is a
vision that represents the ultimate
optimism of a pessimistic age.
The Kent State incident, the
shock of Altamount and its sub-
sequent depression is still with
us.

Whether Charles Reich’s Green
Revolution is merely a plateau
or a permanent plain is a ques-
tion that can only be andwered
by time. That he seeks to pre-
sent a rational and plausible sol-
ution is noble. The fate of his trea-
tise, like all the others, lies with
the unpredictable masses and
thoughts that he so concisely
attempts to define.

Record breaking has been be-
coming a regular occurrance at
the Pitt Field House. Only two
meets have been held there
this year, and in them 13 re-
cords were attained.

In the first meet, a dual meet
against Kent State, five records
were shattered. Saturday. in
the Pitt track classic. the num-
ber increased by eight.

Bill Rea opened the marathon
Classic by setting a new Pitt
varsity record in the broad jump.
His jump 23 to 91/2 inches, broke
teammate Don Poretto’s record
of 23 ft. 5 inches set last year.
Poretto finished second behind
Rea in the event Saturday.

It then became Bryant Sal-

Salter, who had been having a
"little trouble, was to have been

high jump with a six foot six-

_rewarded for their appearances.

In the 440—yard dash, Dorel
Watley won, followed close be-
hind by Ed Marstellar also of
Pitt. Watley’s time of 49.3 left
the athlete dissatisfied.

“I’m glad we won”, he said,
“but I wasn’t satisfied with my
time. I wanted to break 49.0 to
(qualify for the nationals in the
440i” Watley vows he will do
it next week in Baltimore.

Matstellar, on the other hand,
was very satisfied with his
time.

“It was a big thrill," he said.
“I never finished this close to
him (Watley) before. I think
I’m coming along now even
though I was hoping to break

50.0.” Marstellar’s time was
50.1.
Another record was then

broken by Morgan Mosser. of
West Virginia. Mosser, in one
of the most exciting races, "of
the afternoon, barely defeated
John Aiken of Pitt in the 1,000
yd. run. His time of 2:09. set a

new Field House record in the

event.“

Mosser -overcame Aiken in
the last twenty yards of the race
to set the new record. Aiken was
not to be denied, as he also es-
tablished a new Pitt record in
the same event. Aiken’s 2111.9
was good enough to break his
-own mark of last year.

Mosser, who was selected as
the best performer in the Track
events, earned the recognition
shortly afterwards.

ball league’s two—day college
draft last week.

Going in the third round, a
“surprised" Charley Hall was
contacted by the Green Bay
Packers on Thursday.

“I‘ll probably be flying up
there in a few weeks," said the
jubilant defensive back. “I guess
I'm still up on cloud nine."

Hall, who was picked up to
play in both the Blue-Grey Game
and the Hula Bowl, failed to see
much action in either. The groin
injury that sidelined him for
most of his senior year has not
healed yet and according to
Hall it “needed complete rest.”

All-East Team member, Bryant
Salter, who had an outstanding
senior year in the defensive
backfield was grabbed by the
San Diego Chargers in the fifth

Pitt’s Jim Fleming was leading Pelullo, 10-2, at the time.

The match was stopped twice
when Young became groggy from

punishment. Nevertheless, Young “

had a 6-2 advantage when the
call was made. if

“I’ve seen guys foul out
before,” remarked assistant
coach Dick Slutzky, but never
twice in one match.

The match went pretty much
as expected, according to head
coach Dave Adams.

Adams anticipated a close
match. Due to a recent plague
of injuries, he was notable to
put his best team on the mat.

Mark Payne and John Chat-
man were_,- conspicuous by
their absence.

Bobby Kuhn, though not ex-
pected to appear because of a
back injury, wrestltled at 177
pounds and decisioned his op-
ponent, 15-0.

Temples unexpected victory
at 134 influenced Adam's de-

cision to use Kuhn. as long as.

the wrestler appeared to be in
good shape.

“We ceuldn’t afford to give
them three bouts and risk a fall,”
said Adams.

Temple opened the match in
their favor when Jim Flore
pinned Al Cox in 1:11.

Randy Payne evened the
score in the next-bout. pinning
Jim Adams in 3:50. after piling

Shattering a jinx that has
severely plagued them when
taking to the road, the Pitt

Panthers swamped a smaller
Bucknell squad 68-54 at the
Davis Gymnasium Saturday

night on the campus of Buck-
nell University.

Weather conditions, which
turned a normal four hours
trip into a seven-hour grind to
the town of Lewisburg, Pennsyl-
Vania, didn’t appear-to have
any affect. on the cagers’ per-
formance. After a good night’s
sleep and leisurely day around
the Bison campus, the Panthers
were ready to play.

Acquiring an early lead which
they never relinquished,’ the
Cats put their superior size and
shooting ability to use. At the
same time the Panther shifting

praised Pitt Coach Bill Grant.
“He swam his specialty and rac-
ed well. He’s a real springer.”

Dave Wessel, who placed first
in both three—and one—meter div-
ing with scores of 289.65 and
279.90 respectively, missed
qualifying for the Nationals by
0.35 in three meter.

“He’s looking better than
ever,” beamed diving coach Bill
Brown. “He did the two tough-
est dives in the book, the 21/2 re-
verse and the 21/2 back.

The reverse he did real well

‘but he doesn‘t have the confi-

dence in the back. Once he
gets that he won’t miss it.“ ~

Martin Staley, freshman diver,
placed third in both diving
events and qualified for Easterns
in the three-meter with a score
of 207.5.

Bisons into 23 turnouver, 17 of
which came in the first half.

“The only thing that I was
dissatisfied with,” commented
Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl, “was
our first half shooting. We had
42 shots, and if we could have
made more of them we would
have been way ahead. I felt
that we were capable of shoot-
ing better.”

The Panthers shot 27-for-70
overall, giving them a 38.6 per
cent shooting performance from
the floor. Although the Bisons
shot 21-53 for a 39.6 per cent
evening, the difference in shots
taken indicates how tight the
Panther defense was.

“We really held them," said
Ridl. “We forced a lot ‘of turn-
overs.”

gave Ridl a chance to play some

Grant remarked that the Temple
team was thin but that they got
the “most out of everyone."

believed “We could have taken
them, but it just didn't come
off.”

The Panthers Jim Howell took
the lead at one point in the

Pitt lost the 400-—free relay
by only 0.4 seconds» with the
strong team of Lewis, Hayes,

,._Pribis explained the team’s per-

“The free exercise team per-

“All the members of the side

Rogers received 7.05 points

tion, the conversation dealt with a fear
that he says prevails among Blacks.

"There are those who have helped
me——like (Assistant to the Athletic Direc-
tor Bob) Rosborough when I wanted to
talk about courses."A the runner said. “I‘m
friendly with all the coaches up there.
and I know quite a bit about them. . .
But you never know when things will
fall back. That's what I'm personally
afraid of—it can happen."

Despite the admission that the situ-
ation isn‘t as bad as it has been—or can
become. again——Schatzman talls of two
men in theidepartment whmdon‘t have
friendly relationships with him.

Riflers, Girls Lose

Despite a week of hard work
and the addition of some new
shooters. the Pitt rifle team suf-
fered a double loss Friday in a
three—way match with Clarion
and Washington and Jefferson.
Clarion led the trio with a 1263
while W. & J. nipped Pitt by a
point. 1238-1237. The double de-
feat leaves the marksmen with a
3-4 mark. with seven more
matches remaining.‘

The defeats were especially
difficult to take in light of the
fact that W1 & J. was winless
and showed up to the match
with only seven shooters — three
under the minimum. Clarion also
had less than the usual number.
with only nine ril'lers shooting.
Ten is thd ordinary minimum.
with the best five scores counting.

The only bright spots for the
Pitt team were newcomers Wade
Roberts and Tim Schmidt. Roberts
was high man with a 255, and
Schmidt shot a respectable 246.
The only other Pitt shooter to
place above 250 was reliable Bill
Crooks with a 254.

 
 
   

"I guess we just got nervous."
remarked usua1ly—steady Bruce
Barrett. who shot a disappoint-
ing 248. Veteran John Miheal-
sick who has been having a
very poor season was so disgust-
ed by it all that he threatened
to quit the team. If he leaves
he will leave the team with only
four lettermen remaining from
last years championship team.

"Temple has really improved
since last year." related Pitt
women‘s gymnastics coach.
Gail Santillo. as Temple edged
the Pitt Women‘s Team. 67.8—66.
"Last year we beat Temple by
at least, 15 points. but this year
it was a different story.“

The best Pitt could do in any
of the four events was to finish
second. Temples Kim Musgrave

captured first place

In the free exercise event.

Pitts Donna Dimarino and Mary.

Fedorka took second and third.
respectively.

The highest position Pitt was
able to capture in the vaulting
event was with Kathy Krynock
in third. Pitt also took fourth,
fifth and sixth places.

ed second in the balance beam

places were again taken by Pitt.
