were on display in the William Pitt Union on Sunday.

Ravenstahl bargains with nonprofits,

Liz Navratil
News Editor

The tuition tax could die next week
if Pittsburgh’s universities and other
nonproﬁts agree by Monday to give
millions to the city.

But Pitt officials said they feel reluc-
tant to meet the mayor’s deadline.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl told the
leaders of the city’s nonproﬁts, which
include local universities such as Pitt
and organizations likeWest Penn and

Highmark, that if they collecﬁvely
agree by Monday to give the city $5
million per year, he’ll no longer con-
siderthe Fair Share Tax. ’
The Fair Share Tax would require
students to paythe equivalent of 1 per-
cent of their tuition to the city each
year. For in—state students in Pitt’s
School of Arts and Sciences, that’s
about $135. —
]oannaDoven, Ravenstahls spokes-
woman, said Ravenstahl’s deadline has
a bit of ﬂexibility.

SGBreverses decision

for anti- abortion group

Liz Navratil
News Editor

For the ﬁrst time this year, Student
Government Board reversed one of
its decisions, choosing Friday to give
Students for Life ﬁmding to attend an
anti—abortion march.

The board previously denied Sm-
dents for Life, a group that advocates
for anti—abortion issues, the $1,515 it

-requested to attendthe Marchfor Life
in Washington injanuary.

Board member and president-elect
Charlie Shull said at the time that he
thoughtthe groupwas“proselytizing”
for its cause rather than lobbying.

Justin Romeo, who competed
against Shull in this year’s SGB presi-
dential election and represented
Students for Life during its request
for funding, said he thought many
campus groups would be “appalled”
by the statement that the group was
proselytizing. '

Romeo approached the SGB ad-
viser,]oyce Giangarlo, lastweekto see

onMondayand say, ‘Giveusuntil'It1es- -

day,’ we’1l say yes. But either way, [on]
Wednesday, there’s going to be a vote
on the Fair Share Tax,” Doven said.
Currently, more city council mem-
bers favor the tax than oppose it.
ChancellorMark Nordenberg said
inastatementthat Pitt made donations
tothe Pittsburgh Public Service Fund,

a group oflocal organizations thatgive -

donations to the city, and that he “is

preparedtosupportﬁmireﬁmds ifthe

tuition tax proposal is withdrawn.
“However, the deadline that has

where the group got its deﬁnition of
proselytizing. Romeo also e-mailed
Shull for ﬁ.lI'lLh€l' explanation.

Shull said in an e-mail to Romeo
that he was concerned that the New-
man Oratory, a group that had previ-
ously received SGB funding to attend
the March for Life, shared “the same
student membership” as Students for
Life, among other groups.

He explained in a separate inter-
view that he was initially concerned
there would be a “double—dipping of
the ﬁinds.”

Shull also expanded, in his e-mail,
upon his deﬁnition of proselytizing.

“Byway of signage, some members

' ofthese groups have heldsigns justify— ‘

ingtheir pro—lifeviews through divine
purpose and eschatology,” he wrote.
“I interpreted this to be proselytizing
by these groups and voted to deny the
requestknowingwhat some members
of Students for Life have done in the
past at this even ”

He later said he didn’t think Stu-
dents for Life tried to “abuse” funds
and that, upon reconsidering, he didn’t

thinkit’d be fairforhimto suggestthat
Students for Life intended to prosely-
tize, based on what other people had
done at the march in the past.

Board members reconsidered the
issue in a planning session Friday,
when they unanimously decided to

p give Students for Life funding for its

march. .

Board members Nila Devanath
and Ada Noh voted to grant Students
for Life its request during 'I‘uesday’s
meeting.

Romeo said he was happy with
the boardsdecision to give Students
for Life funding, but he still worried
about how the board deﬁned pros-
elytizing. He said he worried that the
board could say groups are proselytiz-
ingsimplybecause they have religious
members.

“If SGB wants to deny students
funding to do advocacy work, lobby-
ing, then they can do that as long as
itsuniformacrosstheboar ”Romeo

. said. ‘flustbecause you have areligious

belief doesn’t mean you should be
treated differently.”

Pitt reluctant to comply

been unilaterally imposed i_sunreal-
istic, and  voluntary contributions
cannot be considered while that co-

ercive proposal is being advanced,”

Nordenberg said.

The Pittsburgh Council on Higher
Education, an organization that rep-
resents local universities, including
Pitt, sent a letter to Ravenstahl saying
its members “will not accept your de-
mands,” according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette.

Doven said if the nonproﬁts give
Ravenstahl the $5 million he’s request-

ed, he’d ask them to help him lobby (

in Harrisburg to ﬁnd ways to get the
additional $10 million needed to cover
the city’s budget.

She said the mayorwould like to in- p

crease-the city’sta'xon emergency and
municipal services ﬁ'om $52 peryearto
$144 per year, but that would require

V the approval ofstate legislators‘.
Nordenberg also hinted that the

city might need the state’s help.
“The pension problem is not lim-
itedto Pittsburgh, and it requires asys-

_ temic statewide solution,” he said.

Tybout lists movie   bests of thedecade

Andy Tybout
Columnist

We’re dangerously close to the end of
the year, and that means lots and lots
oflists. ‘

Have you ever wondered what the
lobestmovies oftheyearwere,butfelt
too uncertain aboutyourownopinion‘?
Let the critics tell you.

Some critics, though, have become
even more ambitious than their usual
“bestofthe year’ ’fare, focusing instead

’ onthemoregrandiose“bestoftl1ede-

cade.”

If you’re faint of heart, you might
want to avoid such lists — the sheer
overﬂow of qualitycanfeel overwhelm-

‘Given all this wonderﬁil data, I
thmightitwouldbe redundanttomake

another “top 10 of the year’ ’ or“top 50
of the decade” list. Instead, Iwill try
something new— giving out awards for

p categories I’ve picked at random.

Usually,I would begin with the dis-
claimer — “’I‘his isjust my opinion”
—— but that’s false. These are actually
the best movies in each respective cat-
eg01'Y- ’

Best“HarryPotter”movie:Although
my personal favorite was the one with
the bad*ss snake, I have to hand it to
directorDavidYates. “HarryPotIer and
the Half—Blood Prince” (2009)wasthe
most mature, emotionally invested of
the series.And thatsoenewiththe water
zombies? That’s probably the scariest
aPG—rated movie since “Raiders ofthe
LostArk.” '

Best superhero movie of the de-
cade: I basically had three movies in
contention for this title — both the

new “Batman” movies and “Spider—
Man.” Unfortunately, for my favorite
Web—slinging superhero, the subdued
menace of Christopher Nolan’s “The
Dark Knight” (2008) wins out. This
was simply the most complex, most
intellectual and most superbly plotted
superhero movie evermade.

Best series to hate this decade: It’s
the one with the vampires. You know,
itstartswith aT and rhymes with“dvvi-
light.”

Besttrailer ofthe decade:This one’s
a tie. The trailers for “Where the Wild
Things Are” (2009) and “Cloverﬁeld”
(2008) both accomplished their goals
beyond the studios’ wildest dreams:
to get people worked into a cinematic
fervorbased on roughlytwo minutes of
footage. “Where the Wild Things Are”
stirred the child within viewers with
dazzling footage of an irnagination-

land, and “Cloverﬁeld” excited nerds

by embedding countless clues in the

trailer itself, creating averitable decod-

ing frenzy on the Internet. While the

latter never reallylivedupto its trailer’s

mysticism, itstillfeltthrillingtowitness

what hadbeen built up as some sort of
dark movie secret.

Worst trend of the decade: I’d say
superheroes, were it not for the abun-
dance of qualitywe‘ve seen from these
movies over the last 10 years. Instead,
Iwillhave to go withacinematography
trend: the shaky cam. It might work
well for certain movies (“The Bourne

Ultimat11m”),but not for every movie. _

The shaky cam is the technique your

‘ mom uses when she first picks up her

camcorderandtriestowalkaroundthe
housewithit. More deliberate shotsare
almost always the bestwayto captivate
anaudience. Let’s hope moreﬁlmmal<-

ers take this to heartin2010.

Best zombie movie of the decade:
To be honest, not many movies even
come close to “28 Days Later” (2002),
and that includes its shaky cam sequel
“28 Weeks Later”(2007). This iswhata

’ zombieapocalypsewouldactiiallylook

like. Prepare accordingly.

Finally, to end inthe holiday spirit,
the best Christmas movie of the de-
cade:Unfort1mately, there wasn’t much
strongco'/mpe_t'itionforthis,butyoucan
take refuge inDarmyBoyle’s “Millions”
(2004), about a kid who discovers a
sack of moneythat’s beenthrownfrom
a train. The only people I can imagine
not liking this movie are people who
have lostlarge sacks of money ontrains.
Otherthan that, it’s

Ryan Leslie releases transitional concept album

Sierra Starks

S taﬂ” Wri ter
Ryan Leslie
Tramilion
Universal

Rocks Like: A mix between Pharrell
and John Legend (minus the vocal
capability)

Grade: B

Triple—threat Ryan Leslie has
done it again. The singer-songwriter
and producer, known for his melodic

creative ability, has produced an-
other album of originality.

Tramilian, his second album in
one year’s time, is named appropri-
ately. This album not only shows the
transition of Ryan Leslie’s affection-
turned-adoration for a particular
young lady, but it also shows his tran-
sition from novice to professional.

The ﬁrst song on the album,
“Never Gonna Break Up,” is an up-
beat track heavily inﬂuenced by a
bass guitar, giving itamodem, ﬁinky
feel.

This ballad highlights Leslie’s de- .

sire to‘ ﬁnd that special someone,
promising never to break up with
the lucky lady.

He ﬁnds, his Cinderella in the next
song selection, “Something That I
Like.”

Throughout the album, this ro-

mance between the two is personi— »

ﬁed with Leslie’s crooning over a
homemade beat, endearing lyrics,
horns, keyboard conﬁgurations and
futuristiclbackdrops.

V This package proves that this al-

bum is not to be taken lightly.

The transformation of Leslie
from a playboy in “You’re Not My
Girl” to a man ready to settle down
in" the album’s last song, “I Choose
You,” keeps the listener wanting
more of this secret summer love to
unfold.

Pusha T from Clipse is the only
other artist featured on the album.

The appeal of a dramatic love
story listening session leaves little
room for intrusion from outside
parties.

Leslie keeps it simple, and in this ’
case, less is deﬁnitely more.

Jermaine Dixon returned to play on Tuesday night.

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

‘ Sixmonths mightseemlil<ealongtime

for some. But for Pitt senior guard]er-
maine Dixon, it must have felt like an
eternity.

Dixon broke a bone in his foot in
June, aninjury that kepthimsidelined
for halfayear, until he ﬁnally retiirned
to the lineup last Tuesday against In-
diana.

Hewas held scoreless in 12 minutes

. againstthe Hoosiers,asPitthead coach

Jamie Dixonis slowlyworkinghimback
into game shape. Dixon stressed that
for even the best players, ittal<es some
time to getbacktowhere onewasprior
to 

“For right now, he’s not the same
player that you’ve seen before,” Jamie
Dixon said. “But I know he’s going to
be right in a couple wee .”

Despite retiimingless thanaweek

ago, Dixon already showed that he’s
starting to come around, scoring his
ﬁrst points ofthe seasoninPit1’s 71-59
win over Kent State on Saturday. ~

He ﬁnished the game with ﬁve
points in 14 minutes, highlighted by
athree—point playwith 4:28 left inthe
second halfwhen he converted alayup
while drawing a foul.

“We saw a differentjermaine to-
day,” Dixon said, referring to his con-
tinued improvement. '

While the scoring from Dixon is
nice, his defense is his calling card as
he is often assignedto guardthe oppos-
ing team’s best perimeter player.

“He’s a great defensive player,”
guard" Ashton Gibbs said. “When he’s
in, you don’t lose anything defen-
sively, and he can knock down shots
aswe .’_’

Whilejerrnaine Dixon admits his

' foot’s still a bit sore, causing him to

sit out Friday’s practice, it has time to
healthisweek until Saturday’s rnatchup

against Mount Saint Mary’s.

Dixon was set to begin playing
again a little more than a month ago,
but suffered a setback when another
Pitt player stepped on his foot in prac-
tice, causing him to miss even more
time than expected.

Now that he’s back, he’s been com-
ing off the bench, but he will return to
the starting lineup eventually.

He believes that his time on the
benchhashelpedhim gaina good per-
spective ofthe game, so when he comes
in, he can step right in and perform.

“You can see alotfrom the bench,”
he said. “But it doesn’t matterwhether
I start or not.”

With Big East play coming up, the
teamwill need a healthy —~ or at least
partially healthy— Dixon to returnto
his old ways. _

Ifhis current pace of improvement
is any indication, No. 24 should look
like he did wearing No. 3 all of last
season.

Liebermanreviews 2009 Big East season bests

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

Let’s get one thing stiaiglit Losers do

not exist when six teams from the Big .
East make a bowl game.

Sure, Pitt fans felt disappointed
when the Panthers lost a heartbreak-
ing 45-44 game to Cincinnati last

‘ weekend.

After the  agony of losing to I

the Bearcats ended, Pitt fans probably. =

pondered overthelostrevenue andrec-.
ognition Pittlostwitii oneﬁiinbledextra
point. This assumption is not true.
But hold on a second, Mr. Lieber-
man.Wikipedia says the payoutforthe
Sugar Bowl is $17 million, compared
to $1 million for the Meineke Car Care
Bowl. 3 ‘ '
The Big East pools the revenues
brought in from all teams during the
bowl season. Because sixtearnswillgo
to bowls, the Big East will give those
teams a pseudo “bonus.” But this also
means Louisville and Syracuse, two
teamsthat didn’t qualify for‘ bowls, get
a payout, aswell. ~
Inotherwords, the BCS, alongwith
the Big East’s other bowl partners —
Gator Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl,
Papajohns.com Bowl, International
Bowl and St. Petersburg Bowl -— pay
the Big East a set. amount. That total
this year is nearly $25 million.
That moneyisiii-a commonpoolto

pay each team’s expenses for its bowl
destination. ,

The rest of the money goes to each
team, based on a number of factors,
suchashowfarateam musttraveland
how many days ateammustbe atthe
site.

All the bowl games have been an-
nounced, so let’s check on howl did
lastweek.

Randy’s Predictions:

Sugar Bowl — Cincinnati

Gator Bowl — West Virginia
Meineke Car Care Bowl —— Rutgers
Papajohns.com Bowl — Pitt

St. Petersburg Bowl Connecticut
International Bowl — South Florida

Actual: _ A

Sugar Bowl — Cincinnati vs. Florida

MeinekeCarCareBowl—-PitIvs.North
Carolina

Papajohns.com Bowl — Connecticut
vs. South Carolina

‘ St. Petersburg Bowl — Rutgersvs.

UCF . ,
InternationalBowl-—SouthFloridavs.
Northern Illinois

Allﬁght, 50 percent isn’tbad, butit
isn’t good, either.

I missed on Pitt because I thought
the Meineke committee would pick

against Pitt’s immobile fan base and
take Rutgers fans, who would bring in
more money. A

Butwhen Pitt received North Caro-
lina_foranearlyChrist:masgiitinthe
bowl game, the committee could aiford
to take Pitt. Oh, well.

The BigEastalreadyannounced its
regular—season awards, but what do
they know? Here are mywinners:

Big East player of the year'(of-
fensive):

Dion Lewis, Pitt 3 V '

Cincinnati survived without Tony
Pikeatquarterbackthisyear. Mardy Gil-
yard wasn’t as consistent, and neither
was WestVirginia’s]arrett Brown.

So this award goes to the fantastic
ﬁeshman.

Lewis amassed 1,640 yards, good
for third in the nation, had 16 touch-
downs in his ﬁrst season and eclipsed
100 yards nine times all year.

Big East player of the year (de-
fensive):

Mick Williams, Pitt .

Williams ﬁnished the yearwith 39
tackles, despite drawing double teams
from opposing offensive lines most of
thetime. Williams alsohadistacklesfor
aloss andthreeforced ﬁirnbles, which
is simply outstanding for a defensive
tackle.

Big East coach of the year

Randy Edsall, Connecticut

There’s a reason Notre Dame con- '

sidered Edsall over Cincinnati coach
Brian Kelly and his undefeated record.
Edsallis amaster motivator, and itwas
none more apparentthan this year.

After the death ofjasper Howard,
three straight losses put the Husldes
at4—5 and needingatleasttwowinsfor

com Bowl.

Plus, against the top Big East com-
petition (Cincinnati, Pitt and West Vir-
ginia), Connecticut lost byacombined
nine points.

Final rankings of power

1. Cincinnati (12-o, 7-0 Big East):
The BigEastchamp's remained perfect
on the year with its win over Pitt, but
it wasn’t without a ﬁght all year after
closewins againstConnecticiit (bytwo
points), West Virginia (three) and Pitt
(one).

2. WestVirginia(9~3, 52): Yeah, it’s
lower in the rankings, but the Moun-
taineers beatPitt and played atougher
non-conference schedule. Pitt couldbe
here, with its win over South Florida
and West Virginia’s blowout loss to the
Bulls, but I’in not buying it.

3. Pitt (9-3, '5-2): It seemed the
Panthers found some way to beat

themselves in all three of their losses.
Defensive mishaps blew a lead against
NC State, turnovers and missed red-
zone chances cost them against West
Virginia, and, of all things, a botched
extra point proved costly against Cin-
cinnati. Otherwise, the Panthers would
be in great shape this year.

.4. Connecticut (7-5’, 3-4): Edsallde—
serves a lot of credit for keeping this
teamontrack, and several close losses
putsthisteaminthetopfour and afa-
vorite for nextyear’s titie. 4

5. Rutgers (8-4, 3-4): After open-
ing against Cincinnati — and getting
destIoyed—theScarletKnights played
nobody else relevant until they went
through the upper tier of the Big East.
But they’re bowlingin sunny St. Peters-
burg.
6. South Florida (7-5, 3-4): Another
late-season collapse for the Bulls, who
can’t seem to close out seasons ﬁill of
promise. Throw in Matt Grothe this
year and maybe this team would have
been ranked much higher.

7. Louisville (4-8, 1-6): New head
coach Charlie Strong, the former
Florida defensive coordinator, should
 the reciuitingtalent
to the Cardinals inupcomingyears.

8. Syracuse (4-8, 1-6): Syracuse
showed improvement under new
coach Doug Marrone this season but
stillneeds muchmoretalentto compete

The huge vinyl tent in the Ca-
thedral of Learning lawn isn’t for
an arts and crafts show, book sale
or ordinary picnic lunch. Instead,
the tent will be used Saturday
night to host 1,500 prominent
alumni, donors and friends of Pitt
as they partake in an international
buffet. _

Following the buffet, the Ca-
thedral will be illuminated by a
spectacular light show.

The buffet is just part of the
Discovery Weekend, which begins
Friday at 10 a.m. with a presenta-
tion by Pitt alumnus Pat Croce,
president of the Philadelphia
76ers.

The mission of the Discovery

Weekend is to announce Pitt’s
Capital Campaign, which will at-
tempt to raise $500 million for
the University. '

The invited guests — mostly
Pitt alumni.—- have a full sched-
ule for the weekend, including
a state of the university address
by Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
political impersonatorjim Morris
and presentations from faculty
showcasing research and inno-
vations.

Before the light show, guests
will attend an entertaining an-
nouncement event at Carnegie
Music Hall which will combine
theater, music, comedy andﬁlm.

“We want to thank the donors
for their support and letthem see
ﬁrsthand what’s going on here at
Pitt,” Pitt Spokesman Ken Service
said. .

Service added that students
will directly see the impact of
the donations, in terms of endow-
ments for scholarships.

“We’d like to increase the
number of scholarships by 50
percent,” Service said. “We’d also

Students —- graduate and undergraduate —

_ allied with faculty and adminisnators last night

in a think tank designed to ﬁnd solutions for
reported racial tension on campus in the wake
of 'Duesday’s tragedies.

After‘ meeting with the Vice Provost and
Interim Dean of Students Dr. Jack Daniel on
Wednesday, Hindu Student Council.President
Ashish Mitra organized a meeting of campus
leaders, students and representatives.Therewas
little more than 24 hours notice.

’ Mitra cited the crowd of approximately 50 as
a sign ofthe campus’ ability to communicate and

“People are feeling uncomfortable,” he said.

Students in the crowd shared their own ex-
periences and their friends’ experiences since
Tuesday’s terrorist attacks inNew York City and
Washington, D.C. They reported uncomfortable
staring, “ignorant” comments muttered orwrit—
ten on residence hall wipe-off boards and even

‘_ spitting. Students reported being harrassed sim-

plyfor appearingto be ofMiddle Eastern descent
while the mediaprojects Saudi ex-patriot Osama
bin Laden as the possible culprit in Tuesday’
assault. ' ‘ .
“Our campus needs to be safe forallstudents,”
Mitra said. “The last thing we need is for more
people to be feeling  unsafe or to get hurt.”

’ Pittpolice chiefTim Delaney said the Univer-
sity police have received no formal complaints
from students, but urged victims to come for-

“You don’t have to put up with this,” Delaney
said of the various forms of harassment. “You

have our support.”

While staringis not apunishable crime, Dela- —

ney and officers Kathy Schreiber and Debbie
Walker emphasized that studentsmust reportall
incidences. EX/en staring can amount to harass-
ment, Delaney said. '

“We wantyou to get control backin your life,”
he said. _

Director of Residence Life Denine Rocco '

reported that her oﬂice has not been officially
notiﬁed of instances of harassment.

“We have seen thus farvery little evidence of
that kind of thing,’.’ she said. ‘

_ But she urged students to come forward and

told the crowd that Residence Life was planning
building-wide and ﬂoor-wide discussions to be

. led by members of the Counselingcenter about

waysto cope with the  ‘

Mitra, who moderated the informalgathering,
collected suggestions from students about how
the University canbetter at:tackthese problems.
He suggested astudentvolunteer escort serviceto
accompanyworried students. He also suggested
campus “safety zones” where victims ofharass—

ment could report incidents and escape.
Other students suggested widening shuttle

4 routes and establishing a safety zone-speciﬁc

Director of Student Activities Joe Cavalla
volunteered the William Pitt Union’s informa-
tion desk as an immediate safety zone. Student

could be set up in public places such as the Tow-
ers lobby or the Ashtray to serve as escapes and
means of education for students who might be
quick to stereotype. Two other members of the

* eight—person board, Michelle Agostini-andjohn
Algie, joined Alex at the meeting. ' ‘

of these solutions, and students were encouraged
to attend today’s open-forum at 3 p.m. in 2K56

News Editor

The following article ran in a prior edition of
The Pitt News. It has not been edited or up-
dated from how it was originally published.

When Steve Blahovec arrived at the William
Pitt Union at 7 am. Friday, he ﬁgured he was
in luck. There was no one camped out on the
porch, there were two people in front of the
ticket ofﬁce and the 97 remaining student
season tickets for basketball were going on
sale in two hours.

He had no idea that there were officially

more than 100 people in front of him. Then, ’

as the crowd from the. Lower Lounge of the
Union emptied into the lobby, bleary-eyed and
clutching pillows, they saw about 10 people
waiting in the front of the ticket window. Many
were not pleased. . '

V The last battle in the basketball ticket war
was about to be waged between a tired mob
of screaming campers and a small group of

‘ confused early—risers. -

_ Blahovec said he had heard tickets were
going on sale, ﬁrst come, ﬁrst serve, at 9 a.m.
in the Union, and hadn’t found out about the

camping in, the wristbands and the already— .

established line until after he was standing in
front of the ticket window.

“If I had known that I could have stayed ‘

inside, I would have been here yesterday af-

ternoon,” he said. “They should have issued a
statement saying that theywere gonna do that.
The athletics department screwed up.”

By 8»a.m., the screaming had subsided
and the tempers cooled to a point of resig-
nation.

_ Jon Wietholter had the ﬁrst wristband. It
was his poster-board list, originally designed
to ensure his place as the ﬁrst to camp out on
the Union porch, that began Thursday night’s
administrative improvisation. He had arrived
at 1 p.m. Thursday, prepared to stay out in the
cold overnight for tickets. After speaking to an
administrator, whose name he did not know,
one speakerphone later that afternoon, he
said he was told to continue keeping track
of people who camefor tickets. According

‘to Wietholter, he was also told the group of

people on the porch would be moved inside
to the Lower Lounge. ' ‘

The sign, with the original list, which read,
“Line For Tix Starts Here,” was moved to the
lobby with the rest of Wietholter’s overnight
supplies. It sat in front of Wietholter, silently
echoing the sentiments of the 100 wristband-
bearing people behind him.

Still, Wietholter said he felt sympathy for
the 10 people left in line ahead of him.

“I know where they’re coming from,” he
said. “If I was in their shoes, I’d probably feel
the same way.” A - ‘

Sophomorejeff Bennett, another camper,
said the process still made sense to him.

“My whole theory is: it was ﬁrst come,
ﬁrst serve. We were here at 1 [p.m. Thursday],
and we were prepared to camp out all night,”
he said. -

Butjunior Lindy Grone, who arrived at the
Union at 6 a.m. Friday, said she felt the point
was that the 100 people behind her hadn’t
camped out.

“If they spent 12 hours in 3Q—degree weath-
er, I would have said ‘ﬁne,”’ she said. “Nothing
was advertised about people being able to stay

at the Union  If that’s how it was gonna be, ’

Ignorance isn’t an excuse.

they should have told everyone that.”

According to WPU manager Chris Chergi,
the decision to move people inside was made
early Thursday afternoon when the growing
group of people on the porch gave her con-
cerns about both the inclement weather and
the blocking of the porch.

' In an attempt to “organize the chaos that
could have come out of the lineup,” she said
she arranged the speakerphone call, which she
said was withjason Heggemeyer, director of
sales and ticketing.

Chergi said, after clearing a room and mov-
ing people inside, signs were posted on every
door to the Union that the line forbasketball
tickets was in the Lower Lounge. '

When askedabout students who said they
did not see thesigns, she said, “they look but
they don’t see sometimes.” ”

Chergi said it was also her decision to re-
quest Pitt police in the Union lobby, although
she said there was no extra security.

“They would be around to make a pres-

    

ence in case there was a problem,” she said,
but added, “everybody was very nice and very
patien .”

It was those police who, at about 8:50 a.m.,
asked the group of 10 people at the front of the
line to move, which they did as applause and
cheers came from the mass of people behind
Wietholter.

Grone, Blahovec and the others were all
given wristbands numbered in the 7140s, well
behind the number 70 97 that marked the last

. person who would get tickets.

“A wristband means nothing to me,” Bla-
hovec said. “They said they were handing
them out once, why are they handing them
out again?” -

Blahovec referred to the Pitt Men’s Bas-
ketball Student Ticket Plan pamphlet which
reads: “Make sure you make plans to join us
for Midnight Madness, as this will be the only
chance you have at getting your prenumbered
wristband.”

Blahovec said the officer who asked him

9 to move did not give a speciﬁc reason for re-

moving them. _

A “They had no reason, they just ‘said ‘refer
to the athletics department,’ who knows noth-
ing,” he said.

Some in line, such as junior Dave Hof-
man, had little sympathy for Blahovec and
company.

“Ignorance isn’t an excuse,” Hofman
said. _ ,

But Blahovec said he didn’t feel like igno-
rance of the overnight line was his fault.

“For the Pitt-Penn State game, people lined
up here in the morning two years ago,” he said.
“There wasn’t a problem then, but there’s a
problem now. I’ll tell you why because [athlet-
ics director] Steve Pederson sucks.”

“It might not be his fault,” Blahovec added,
“but he’s the athletics director, he has a say.”

Blahovec and several of his displaced com-
panions left the Union, saying they were going
up to Pederson’s ofﬁce.

Pederson was out of his oﬂice Friday. Nei-
ther he, Heggemeyer nor anyone else in the
athletics department could be reached for
comment this weekend.

Friday,]an. 10, 2003

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg: You’ve got a
problem.

Things have been going pretty well up 
now. Under your very capable direction, Pitt has
upped its applications and its average SAT scores,
signiﬁcantly increased enrollment, beautiﬁed its
buildings and grounds, and greatly improved its
sports teams.

And all of that spells good news for any uni-
versity. Pitt is earning a certain prestige that it
deﬁnitely lackednlo years ago, and many would
arguethatyou’rethemantothank.

_ So thank you: Because of your leadership, my
diploma will continue to become more valuable
even after I graduate, and as the improvements
continue.

But with the good comes the bad, and you’re
also the man who must take the blame when it’s
due. Like when the Princeton Review ranks Pitt
11th worst for racial interaction. Or when tuition
increases during my college career here have av-
eraged 9 percent yearly — almost three times
the rate of inﬂation. Or when both of the major

   

newspapers serving the Pittsburgh area criticize
youinprintfor receivingapay raise that amounts

to an extra $122,500 yearly in your already well— I

lined pocket. .

The Pittsburgh Tribune—Review, a paper tha
leans just slightly right of staunchly conservative,
write in its Dec. 26 editorial, “We’re certainly not
members of the class—envy crowd  but even we
thing [Nordenberg’s] new pay package is a but
mu ”

And most people are saying the same thing.
Students wonder atthe factthatyourpay increase
—- not countingthe $75,000-per—yearbonus just
for sticking around — is the same 14 percent as
lastyear’s tuition increase. Staffmemberswonder
howtheUniversitycancutseveral jobs inthe name
of saving money, and then award the chancellor
andﬁve top—level administrators asalary increase
that approaches a combined half—million dollars
peryear in spending increases. .

And outsiders — Pittsburgh residents who
have never even stepped foot on Pitt’s campus,
but have read one ofthese newspapers—wonder
how their children will ever be able to alford col-
lege in an academic setting which is increasingly
focused on wealth over knowledge. Ifthe tuition
continues to grow as it has since I arrived here,
students can expect to pay upwards of $20,000
per year, plus room and board, before a dozen
years have passed.

Staff report

The following article ran in a prior edition of
The PittNews. It has not been edited orupdated
ﬁ'orn how it was originally published.

Thursday, Sept. 2, 2004

In a_University Update issued Wednesday,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg armounced that
Pitt would join the two—thirds of Fortune 100
companies andithe nearly‘8ol percent of As-
sociation of American Universities members
that offer domestic partner beneﬁts, «

Beginningjanuary 2005, Pittwill offer do-
mestic partner health insurance beneﬁts for
eligible employees. The beneﬁts, which will be
available to both same-sex and opposite-sex
panners, herald the beginning of the end to a
battle that has sparmed the coming and going of
chancellors, Pitt professors, students activists
and Pitt spokespeople.

“I’m totally excited. It’s about time Pitt de-
cided to do the right thing and catch. up with
the rest of the world,” saidjosh Ferris, former
president of Rainbow Alliance, Pitt’s Gay, Les-
bian, Bisexual, 'I‘ransgendered and Queer or-
ganization; Ferris devoted much of his-time
as a student leader to activism and education
about the the case. ' _

“I feel like I could give money to Pitt right
now. Well, if I had money, I could give them

money,” Ferris added. — ,1
Although the eight-page University Updat
was distributedthroughout campus in Univer-
sity media boxes, the health insurance coverage
issue was not addressed until the ﬁfth page.
Preceding the topic were sections addressing
individual achievements of students,.fac_ulty
members and alumni; governmental support;
meeting challenges; and building Pitt’s collec-
tive strength. .3.
Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs Robert Hill

said the timing of the aimouncement aﬁ'ecte;d »

how the chancellor chose to present it.

“He thought that itwas a good timeto reﬂect
on the accomplishments of the previous year,’,’
Hill said ofthe chancellor’s use of tl1e University
Update. “And it’s.also a good time to indicate

important news.” ’ , - ..
Hill said the three pages of text surrounding’
the armouncement and providing background

on thecase and debate were included .“so the

people would have aﬁill understanding of what;

brought us up to that momen ” \ y
In the past, Pitt’s argument for not provid-

ing the beneﬁts depended largely on the fear

that state legislators might react negatively,

to a same—sex.beneﬁts decision and cut Pitt’s _

appropriations. Pitt discussed the issue with
many state lawmakers as the University moved
«toward the decision, Hill explained, saying hej
hopes legislators will recognize that “this is 
appropriate action for Pitt atthis time.” J
But not all readers found the presentation
appropriate, and‘ most student leaders on cam-

 still did not know about the decision by

_Wednesday afternoon. For Ferris, the experi-

ence reading the letter was bittersweet.

“You sneak it in there, and you sound like
the good guys,” he said of the letter. “Why
couldn’t this have been accomplished eight
years ago?”

On campus, student opinion was largely in
favor of theprovision, even amongthose, such
as freshman Amar Mehta and Dan Sheidy, who
personally oppose-homosexual relationships.

“I can’t say thatlwould viewaheterosexual
marriage and a homosexual marriage under the
same terms,” Mehta said, but added, “Fm not
against gays having the same righ .”

7 Sheidy also voiced concerns over elirninat—
ing differences in treatment of different sexual
orientations.

 “I think, stereotypically, [homosexual re-
lationships] are less monogamous,” he said,
but added that, if a couple could prove their
monogamy, as in the case of a signed afﬁdavit

bow Alliance President Monica Higgins, she
pointed out that the process of obtaining do-
mestic partnerbeneﬁtswillprobably still prove
tricky to navigate. '

“I ﬁgure it will be a fairly difficult process,
butthey are making concessions,” Higgins said,
noting that applyingfor any beneﬁts at Pitt en-
tails a complicated process, and that she doesn’t
expect Pitt to change that process. _ ‘

Gary DiNardo, who is also involved in Rain-
bow Alliance, believes Pitt’s decision marks a
victory, regardless of complications that might

  Must be * to Drink,

like the one Pitt will require, they should be .

granted beneﬁts.
T3 Sophomore Jennifer Hopkins went fur-
ther.

“We are all humans and we have equal
ri ts,” she said. “Maybe this will bring more
andbetterfacultyto the University—insurance
beneﬁts are important to people.”

Students in favor of new beneﬁt plans  

arise in the coming months.

“No matter what this includes, it’s a step
up,” DiNardo said. .

Addressing fears that Pitt’s offering might
be as disappointing to supporters as Temple’s
2002 beneﬁts deal, former Pitt student Cecilia
Frerotte suggested that Pitt would not offer an
unrealistic solution after such a long battle. '

“I can’t imagine that they would make this
concession, then go only one-fourth of the way,”

Arented Cadi]1ac*Escalade, adance marathon
meeting, abunch of student leaders, some strange
rumors and the number 87.

But what does it all mean?

Kelly denies existence of the group, saying
that he’s busy preparing for graduation and job
interviews.

“I think it’s kind of ﬁmny that people are so
paranoid,” Kelly said.

But more than one source has veriﬁed Kelly’s
participation in the group, including one source
who claims to have ﬁrsthand knowledge of 87.

Kelly said that he suspects the rumors are
the work of the Druids, a known secret society
at Pitt.

“I would assume all this nonsense is coming

I think it’s kind of funny that people are so

' paranoid. p

Investigationand interviews with anonymous
sources point to a new secret society on campus
called The Order of the 87.

An anonymous tip to The Pitt News said that
the group planned on holding its initiation meet-
ing to induct new members — including SGB
presidential candidate Zach Ransom — Oct. 20
in an event thatwould include the use of a Cadillac
Escalade rented by Kelly.

When_asked aboutthecarrental, Kelly—who
drives aHondaAccord — said itwas to celebrate
a job interviewwith Lord_& Taylor. .

“Me and some friends rented it and drove
around obnoxiously because we were in a great
mood,” Kelly said.

In what is believed to be one of the groupis
gatherings, student leaders met in a classroom
onthefourthﬂoorofPosvarHall atabout11p.m.,
Oct. 26. 4

When Ransom and slate matejoe Leinbach

were askedwhattheywere doingasthey exitedthe

meeting, Ransom said itwas acampaign meeting.
Jen Anukern, who is also running on their slate,
was not present.

_ As SGB allocations chair Michelle Turbanic
leﬁ: the room, she said that itwas aplanning ses-
sion for a Greek Week dance-marathon event to
take place in December. She soon reentered the
meeting. '

When The Pitt News entered the room and

asked whatwas going on, participants maintained
that it was for the dance marathon.
1 Greek adviser Chris Meaner, who is helping
organize the dance marathon,wasnotatti1e‘meet-
ing. Students atthe meetingsaidthiswas because
he doesn’t attend meetings at night.

’ Also absent from the meeting were dance
marathon chairKate Brown, co—chairs LeighAnn
Smith andJoe.Ebner, activities chairKate Carpen-
ter, fundraising chair Kristyn Stewart and Greek

Week chair Brian Schopfer.

Students presentat the meeting explained that
they needed to have this meeting late at night to
accommodate busy student leaders’ schedules.
They said itwas inPosvarHallbecausetl1eywould
have had to go through Facilities Management to
reserve a room inthe William Pitx Union.

The following morning, in a phone interview
with The Pitt News, Meaner said that there had
beenadance marathon meetingthe nightbefore
— from about 9:30 to 10:15 in 630 William Pitt
Union —— and he had been present.

“Student leaders deny society’s existance

Turbanic and Kelly both said yesterday that
the meetingwas “very preliminary” but focused
on recruiting volunteers and planning the setup
for the dance marathon.

Police chief: Few arrests, all things considered  '

Super Bowl 4 23

pglrttnent were available to comment because of
the preparations needed for today’s Super Bowl
parade — which is Downtown and starts at 11

‘ a.m.

Pitt Police partnered withthe city police to help
control the crowd. .
e:Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney said that there
were very few arrests and citations considering
the size of the celebration.

“You have a thousand people standing there
and two people will do something stupid,” he
said.

Delaney said thattherewere, to thebestofhis
knowledge, atotal of four cars overuimed.

On Forbes Avenue Sunday, people were tear-

ing down street signs and carrying them like the
standard of a drunken medieval army. Following
them downthe streetwas akegcarriedbythe
combined efforts of another crowd. .
‘* ‘*¥~On Semple Street, a group of fans lit a couch
on ﬁre. They added a tire, wooden planks and a
dumpstertothe blaze, butﬁreﬁghters responding
to the scene put it out in aﬂash of steam.

Some members of the crowd tookto chanting
“Fireﬁghters,” inawaythatsounded suspiciously
similarto the tune “Let’s go Steelers.” _

Delaney said that building owners in Central
and South Oaklandwere toldbefore Sundayto have
theirtenants remove anyfurnitureﬁbmporches.
In the event of a couch ﬁre, however, there were

extra ﬁre tmcks dispatched to Oakland.

The police closed ForbesAvenuebetweenMc-

the celebrations. Atabout11p.m., oﬂicers cleared

.“I expect nothing less from the city of Pitts-

revelry and spotted destruction. “I love it, it’s just
crazy. People were uprootingtrees infront of the

i Policeinriotgearevenmally marchedthrough

to leave the street.

The party continued on Forbes Avenue, where
students — many of them clad in black and gold
and afew of them shirtless — ran amok, shouting
Steeler slogans.

Rioters knocked over newspaper stands and
trash receptacles, tearing them apart and setting
ﬁretothewaste. Streamingtoiletpaper rolls were
ﬂung across Forbes from the Litchﬁeld Towers
patio.

Parts of Forbes Avenue were soon covered
with trash and debris, as some people emptied
out rubber trash bins and kicked them around
like beach balls. One trio of students uprooted a
post with an emergency phone booth on it and
disappeared with it down Atwood Street.

Whentherewas nothingleltto knock over, riot-
ers tossed the toppled newspaper stands around
while a pile of trash was lit aflame in front ofjoe
Mama’s.

 student Brian McGuirk '

said. “I wish they hadn’t messed with the cars
though. My car caught on ﬁre alittle bit ﬁom a

At one point in the night, people piled onto

people inside the van shook the unwanted pas-
sengers and quickly drove away.

of them holding up cameras and camcorders to
capture the moment.

“God bless Pittsburgh,” Pitt Greensburg stu-

I came allthe way ﬁom PolishHillto see the riots
here. I think alot of people have come down here

Twenty were from other parts of Pennsylvania

and eight were from other states.

Bymidnight, Forbes Avenue looked like itwas

remaining rioters grewworse as the state troop-
ers and mounted police began to systematically

Macey said. “If she was doing any cleaning up

On Wednesday night, Feb. 21, custodial su-
pervisor Randy S. Schmotzer approached Butko,
whowas assigned to clean the 21stto 37thﬂoor_s,
about Macey’s complaint.

According to‘ Butko’s EEOC ﬁling, she and
a fellow employee cleaned the classroom and
bathroom despite the late—night presence of a
faculty member on the ﬂoor.

Later that night, Butko says Schmotzer told

her that the bathrooms were stillﬁlthy, then ﬁred
herfor not completing her work. Butko said she

human resources, would not comment speciﬁr

portunity to asses someone and give them an
