A federal—court judge set a
precedent yesterday when he
ruled that withholding campus
police records from the public
was unconstitutional under
Missouri state law, and that the
federal law did not apply to
campus police records.

US. District judge Russell G.
Clark, who made the landmark
decision, said Southwest Missouri
State University could not keep

records or security reports.

Clark added that if the Family
Education Rights and Privacy Act
was applied to campus police
records and security reports, it
would be a violation of the First
and Fifth Amendments, which
guarantee freedom ofspCQch and
due process of law.

The Missouri suit was initiated
in January I990 by Traci Bauer,
editor in chief of The Southwest
Standard, a school newspaper at

Proposed bill will make
state-related schools public

By Stacey Jakubowski
stag Writer

A bill to include state-related
universities under the Right to
Know Act will soon be introduced
to the Pennsylvania State
Legislature, according to State
Representative Ronald Cowell (D-
\\"ilkins).

Cowell, chair of the Ilouse
Education Committee, said he is
presently working on the bill and
will propose it to the state
legislature around the first week

“Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln are state-related
universities receiving large sums
of money from the state, and
there is no reason that these
universities should be treated
differently than state—owned and
locally owned universities who
are covered by the Right to Know
Act," said Cowell.

According to Cowell, it will be
very easy to change the Right to
Know Act to include state-related
universities.

Henry Charlton,

that the funds be denied.

“Allocations saw all these

told the board. “They may

Campus Concepts

In light of this decision, Mark
Goodman, executive director of
the Student Press Law Center,
said things do not look good for
Pitt’s new policy of withholding
campus police records from the
public.

Goodman said that the
University of Pittsburgh has no
legal justification to withhold
police records as a result of the
Missouri decision.

“This is the only decision of
this kind in the country and will
be the precedent that is used
should other universities decide
to go to court to get access to
police records," he added.

“Education will be vital in not
only allowing women and
minorities to close the income
disparities between them and the
rest of the population, but in
allowing for the advancement of
our nation,” said Sullivan.
“America in the 21st century will
need everyone to contribute to
the best of his or her ability.”

Education will be the way that
Americans will compete with the
Japanese, the South Koreans and
the Germans, he said.

Sullivan graduated from
Morehouse College in 1954,
where he met Dr. Benjamin Elijah
Mays, who served as an
inspiration to him. Sullivan said
that Dr. Mays, who taught him
that everyone is personally
responsible for the life he or she
leads, can serve as an inspiration
to all.

“As (Dr. Mays] put it, ‘It is not
your environment; it is you -——— the
quality of your mind, the integrity
of your soul and the determination
of your will —— that will decide
your future and shape your life,’”
said Sullivan. “Dr. Mays’
conviction must be our
conviction.”

Society’s most urgent problems,
ranging from drug and alcohol

There’s a good reason
your Collegiate Reps know

abuse to teen pregnancy, arise
because people are failing to take
personal responsibility for their
behavior, according to Sullivan.
“The consequences to us as
individuals and to our society are
devastating, " said Sullivan. “Take,
for example, the consequences
of irresponsibility in bringing
children into the world. While
only one of 10 children growing
up in a two-parent family today is
poor, half of all children growing

up in female-headed households
are poor and suffer dis-
proportionately poor health.”
Sullivan also talked about the
consequences of alcohol abuse.
He said that over two million
Americans suffer injuries from
violent and abusive behavior due
to alcohol abuse and over 20,000
die. In addition, according to
Sullivan, alcohol is a factor in
nearly half of all the deaths caused
by motor-vehicle accidents and

by fatal injuries such as homicide
and suicide.

“In fact, virtually all of the
leading causes of premature
death in America today—— that is,
death before the age of 65,
including cancer, heart disease,
diabetes and AIDS —- are
influenced by Americans’ health
behavior. and lifestyle choices.”

Personal responsibility is
extended to fulfilling obligations
of service to family, community

and nation, he said.

“Although we may spend as
much as $486 billion in fiscal year
1991, it is clear to me that in spite
of all the money, many of our
society’s problems can only be
addressed by concerned,
committed individuals and
community groups."

Also speaking at the
convocation were students
Nathan Urban and Andrea
Goodrich.

there’s also incredible unity, hope,

DAYTO.\'A BEACH, Fla.—Biker
‘Week began on a sour note this
year in Daytona Beach, as over
41 members of the Warlock bike
gang were arrested on federal
charges of weapons, explosives
and drug violations.

The arrests were the result of a
year-long investigation.

Steve Martin, an agent for the
US. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, went undercover
and was recruited into the
Warlock club. Martin became a
full-fledged member and
eventually president of the Fort
Lauderdale chapter.

After the arrests, Martin said he
would be glad to return to
ordinary society after being
hunted by rival gangs, nearly
having his cover blown and
associating with men now
accused of illegally selling
machine guns and homemade
bombs.

“The l5~month drug bust that
came to a head and resulted in
one man dead, the head of the
Warlock gang, has had no effect
on the scores of bikers in
Daytona,” said Frank Whittaker,
a member of the Daytona 200
bike club.

According to Whittaker, only 1
percent of bikers are in gangs.

The rest of Biker Week went
smoothly, as over 575,000 bikers
from 50 states cruised the streets
of Daytona.

Biker Week, which began in
1937 with bike races, was officially
started in 19/11, making I991 the
50th year.

Activities included meeting
fellow bikers from all over the
world and riding and swap meets,
where parts and occasionally

‘bikes were traded.

Gus Chiarella, a biker from
New Jersey, has been coming to
Daytona for Biker Week since
1983.

“I come down for the weather,
the atmosphere and so I can ride
my motorcycle. You drink and
meet nice people from all over
who share a common interest,”

 

people, and that's just not so.
We’re just here to have a good
time,” said Chiarella.

Joan Cox was a good example.
She’s not a guy at all; she’s just a
free-loving spirit from Virginia,
who, along with her husband,
loves to ride her Harley.

“I came down here because it’s
fun and it’s a nice warm place for
me to ride my bike,” said Cox,
who owns an ’89 Softtail Harley
Davidson.

“The majority of us aren't bad,”
said Larry Cox, Joan’s husband.
“The majority of us aren’t bums;
we’re doctors and lawyers. I’ve
worked for the federal
government for 21 years. We get
a few bad, and that’s what makes
the headlines, but we never make
the headlines for the good things
that we do. On a nice day we go
to foster homes and ride children
around. They love it and so do
we, and we raised over $300,000
for a child that got burned.

“Biking is a family-oriented
sport, and anyone who is a biker
is an enthusiast,” said Larry Cox.

Crime just one aspect of Daytona spring madness

By Renee Crespy
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla — When
thousands of students pour into Daytona
Beach for a week of partying, things can
sometimes get a little out of hand. Underage
drinking, shoplifting, damaged hotel rooms
and falling off balconies are just a few of
the things that can happen.

Shops in Daytona Beach report a definite
increase in shoplifting during spring break.
According to Steve Chance, manager of
Maui Nics Surf Shop, sales go up during
spring break by 75 percent, but shoplifting
also increases.

9 “There is definitely a lot more shoplifting
during spring break. We put more
employees on and watch a lot more
carefully, but even then shoplifting goes
up,‘ said Chance.

Denise Girard, an employee at the Private
Eye clothing shop, said that when shop
employees catch shoplifters, they give

them a chance to pay.

“Shoplifting deﬁnitely increases during
spring break. We have caught a few
already, but most of the time we tell them
either to pay for it now, or we call the
cops. We give them a choice,” said Girard.

Shops aren’t the only ones that have to
be wary of collegestudents on spring
break. Hotels also are on the watch for
rowdy guests, and as a safety precaution,
Howard Johnson's sealed off all balconies
during spring break. According to
Dale Pullen, a Daytona Beach security
guard, the balconies are sealed to keep
intoxicated students from falling.

“People get drunk, lean over, and fall
off; it’s really quite easy. No one has fallen
off this year, but last year three kids were
killed —— one was from Pennsylvania and
two were from New York,” said Pullen.

Although the hotels have taken
precautions with the balconies, this doesn’t
stop students from trashing the rooms
every so often, and four Pitt students were

charged over $1,200 for damages to their
room.

Pete Musacchio, one of the students
charged, said, “We got drunk, and things
got a little out of hand. There ended up
being a hole in the wall big enough for
Roseanne Barr to walk straight through.
This happened on Friday night, and we
were forced to pay $1,200 before 10 a.m.
on Saturday, or criminal charges would be
filed and warrants issued for our arrests.
We didn't have the money, so our parents
had to wire it down to us,” said Musacchio.

Mark Weiss, Musacchids roommate,
said, “My parents were upset, but they
were more concerned about my safety.
We were wrong in what happened, but I
felt that the price was completely unfair.
However, we were backed in a corner.
What it came down to was to either pay or
be arrested. We really had no choice, so
we split the cost four ways.”

“It was a learning experience,” said
Musacchio. “I spent $1,400 on this trip --

well, actually my dad spent it, but he
doesn’t know it yet. The damages for the
room were more than I paid for the entire
trip plus spending money. I should have
spent my money on a trip to Cancun.”

Pullen said that so far there hasn’t been
much trouble, but the worst is yet to come.

“So far everyone has been behaving, but
it varies from day to day, depending on
how much alcohol they drink. Basically,
it’s just kid stuff, but next week we’re in for
it because New York is coming down, and
those kids are wild. You take them out of
the city and put them on a beach, and
watch out,” said Pullen.

Harry Pickle, also a Daytona security
guard, said everything has been ﬁne so far
this year.

“The kids have been greatso far, and I’m
sure everything will continue to be great
until next week when the kids from New
York come down. Then the clubs, guns
and chains come out, and it’s nightmare
time around here,” said Pickle.

Three sm/ees against Pitt. ..

The University of Pittsburgh refused to"listen to the
wishes of its students and permit access to campus police
records. It did not budge Tuesday after City Council
passed a resolution telling Pitt to do so. Now, however,
the university’s case may be crumbling under federal law.

U.S. Districtjudge Russell G. Clark ruled yesterday that
the Missouri State Open Records Act does apply to
campus police records. The ruling came as a result of a
lawsuit filed by the Southwest Standard, a newspaper at
Southwest Missouri State University.

Clark said that the Buckley Amendment could not cover
these records, as it would be a violation of both the First
and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution, which grant
the rights of free speech and due process of law.

But the Missouri ruling sets a precedent which must be
followed by other universities. It clears up an extremely
vague law and will now prohibit universities from hiding
behind wording and give the public what it demands:
information about the extent of crime on campus.

The Buckley Amendment, also known as the Family
Education Rights and Privacy Act, passed through Congress
in 1974. The amendment stated that universities could

" lose federal funding if they disclosed student education

D

it

criminal activity.”

records.

The law is very vague as to whether or not this includes
campus police records. Pitt claimed that the law covers
law-enforcement records as well. This decision, however,
denies Pitt that claim.

Pitt has defended its actions and based its case on this
very law. Now that a federal judge has ruled that it does
not apply, The Pitt News believes that the university does
not have a case and should therefore allow access to
campus police records.

This is not the first time that colleges have lost lawsuits
in their bids to hide crime reports from students. A court
decision for the University of Florida stated that “an
individual’s enrollment at a state university does,-not
entitle him or her to any greater privacy than
members of the general public when it comes to reponing

~ ~19:  ~.-,

Furthermore, a 1986 case involving East T ' f."_ee
State University stated that campus police recorldsfell
under the state's open—records law. Pitt belief’, wtijat
campus police records do not fall into that 

With these three rulings, the University of Pittsburgh
now has three strikes against it. Because Pitt violates a
federal ruling, it must abolish its policy of withholding
public information immediately. For even if the university
felt arrogant enough to ignore the feelings of both its
corhmunity and its surrounding city, it must not go
against the laws set forth by its country.

The celebration has begun in
full.

American troops coming home
from the Persian Gulf are being
given huge ceremonies and
parades. Americans turn out by
the thousands to congratulate the

heroes who have risked their
lives during the past seven months
and also to remember those who
didn’t come back. One of the
most touching episodes of the
entire conflict was the memorial
service for the 14 members of the
14th Quartermaster Unit out of
Greensburg, who lost their lives
a errant Scud attack.

Yet according to many experts
who spoke before the war, none
of this should be happening this
soon.

Many experts believed that
America would be fighting a
bloody, drawn—out campaign in
which some 10,000 soldiers would
die. Many people believed that
the conﬂict would drag on for
three months or more.

So why are they back so soon?
How did we defeat an army of 1
million men over a six-week
period at the cost of 100 American
lives? Granted, one life lost in
wartime is expensive enough,
but when a group of some
500,000-plus takes part in a battle,
that cost should have been much
higher. But why wasn't it?

The answer was not American
air supremacy or superiority or
whatever. (We would have blown
the hell out of them anyway.) It
wasn’t American superiority
the ground. (We would have  ‘

As fruitless as they might have
been to some, as much as many
believed that they should have
been given more time to work,

 

Tatusko

the answer to the short war was
the U.N. sanctions applied to
Iraq.

The complete economic
embargo instituted against Iraq
devastated the country. Food and
decent drinking water were in
short supply to troops and
civilians alike. Money normally
gained from exports stopped
ﬂowing. Everything from light
bulbs to car batteries were
unavailable for everybody.
Gasoline was eventually cut off
to civilians.

This, in turn, turned the Iraqis
against one another. Troop
morale dwindled to an all-time
low as the military questioned its
presence in Kuwait. Citizens, busy
finding what food they could to
survive, became fed up with the
government. Iraq is now
embroiled in a civil war in an
attempt to overthrow Saddam
Hussein, with the port (ity of
Basra already controlled 
populations. 7- ° ’

It all leads back to the sanaions. _

did an important job: They
shortened a conﬂict.

U.N. sanctions really did Work

Because people didn’t have
the resources and because the
army didn’t have backup supplies,

morale in both areas plummeted.
Iraq realized that the world was
against it, and after six weeks of
bombardment and 100 hours of
ground ﬁghting, promptly gave
up, with over 100,000 casualties.

People in this country argue
that the sanctions should have
been given more time to work.
They say that all of this bloodshed
could have been avoided had the
sanctions been given a few years
to work.

America, however, is an
impatient land. We wanted
eirerything to be over as soon as
possible. A war would do that
more quickly than sanctions
alone.

Furthermore, sanctions alone
would not have stopped Saddam.
He has shown in the past and
present that he cares little about
his people, as long as his power
base and military remain intact.

But the sanctions are what made
the conflict so short. Without
them, hundreds of Americans
would be losing their lives daily
in the sands of Kuwait, attempting
to dig out Iraqi troop positions.
Morale in this country would have
dropped to Vietnam levels. The
coalition could have collapsed,
especially in the Arab world,‘ and
America would have virtually
fought alone, possibly turning
the war into an Arab—Is£aeli

Iraq wanted.

Cowboy team which also has 7-

Temple and Purdue will be a
good matchup, although some
might find it boring. Both teams
are so deliberate that the score
could be in the 505. On the good
side, this could be a rare
opportunity to witness a Temple
fast break. Get that VCR ready.

Among other first-round games,
the Florida State-USC duel will be
a good game, despite what Billy

are basketball giants, but they are
well suited for each other. Look
for a scoring battle between

forsees
comeback

By Chris Kuzneski

Staff Writers

The longest road trip in
Pitt baseball history got even
longer when the Panthers
opened their nine-game
Florida trip with a five-and-
one-half-hour, 13-inning
loss against Mercyhurst
College.

And unfortunately for the
Panthers, the defeat set the
tone for the rest of the trip.

Pitt finished the stretch
with a 2-7 record, but pitcher
Dennis Terzich said there is
some reason for optimism.

“We know we’re a better
team than last year,” said
Terzich. “We're a different
type of team, and we’ll be
better off in the long run. ”

That enthusiasm was very
evident on March 5 against
Rollins College, when the
game was stopped in the
eighth inning because of a
bench-clearing brawl.

“The benches just
emptied," said Pitt pitcher
Don Carpenetti. “It was sort
of wild.”

Pitt ended up with two
losses as a result of the
incident. The Panthers lost
the suspended game 5-3,
and they lost relief pitcher
Fred Iriti because of a
dislocated knee suffered in
the brawl.

The loss seemed to
motivate the Panthers, as
they responded with two
wins in a row the only
two of the trip.

The first was a 4-2 victory
against Penn State. Senior
pitcher Des Schnur ca ptu red
the win, and Terzich got
the save.

The Panthers’ second win
came the very next day with
a 5~’l win over .\’ortheast
Illinois. Marc Picciano
pitched eight and one—third
innings to give the Panthers
the win. The senior transfer
from Allegheny College
came into the game late in
the first inning and denied
NE Illinois any more runs.

The Panthers concluded
the trip with two more
defeats, but their spirits
remained upbeat.

“We have just as strong a
feeling as ifwe had finished
the trip 7-2,” said Terzich.

Although the Panthers did
come home with seven
losses, many of the players
shined in sunny Florida.

the eye of the tiger in him" by
Stottlemyer. Hovan lets his actions
do the talking on the mat.

As soon as the first whistle
blows to start the match, Hovan
turns into a wild dog, preying on
his opponents.

He is quick and smart, and is a
total team leader. Anyone who
has seen him wrestle would not
question his ability.

Kloiber, the freshman surprise
who has adapted well to the
college wrestling scene, took a
third-place trophy.

Welcome Back from Spring Break!

It’s a good time to break a habit.

Finally, team captain Miller,
who Stottlemyer has been proud
of all season, took a second-
place finish in the EWL. All
throughout the season,
Stottlemyer couldn’t say enough
about Mi1ler’s work ethic and
leadership style on and off the
mat.

All three men competed against
wrestlers from West Virginia, Lock
Haven, Penn State, Edinboro and

   

Clarion along with other EWL

The Panther wrestling team
ended with a disappointing 4-11
season, but these wrestlers have
more than proved that they
belong in the big leagues of
college wrestling. They should
provide much action this week
(March 14-16) at the NCAA

Lacrosse club improves to 3-0

By Spencer Borisoff
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt Panthers lacrosse club
improved its record to 3~0
Tuesday night at Pitt Stadium,
despite a sub-par performance,
with a 12-7 victory over Allegheny
lacrosse league rival Washington
and Jefferson College.

The Panthers came out
scratching and howling and
grabbed an early lead before
being temporarily declawed in
the second and third periods by
W&J.

Pitt took a 1-0 lead on co-
captain Lee Stember’s unassisted
goal just two-and-a-half minutes
into the game and mounted two
more scores before W&J could
retaliate.

By halftime, though,
Washington and Jefferson had
narrowed Pitt’s lead to just one

   
       
     
     

5.:

goal, 6-S, because of sloppy play
on the part of the Panthers.

“There was a period where we
could have very easily given the
game away,” co-captain Harper
Watters said. “Somehow, though,
we pulled it together and took
W&J out of their game.”

According to Pitt Coach Gary
Neft, W&J utilized dirty tactics
and also capitalized on Pitt
mistakes.

“It was a very hard—hitting game,
and Washington and Jefferson
gave their share of cheap shots,”
Neft remarked after the game.
“The only time W&J looked good
is when we made them look
good — when they scored
because of our mistakes."

Neft and many Pitt players
attributed their out—of—sync play
to their early spring break.

“We’ve been on spring break
and haven’t played in 10 days,”

Neft said. “That’s why we had
trouble doing the basics tonight,”
he continued.

Co—captain Eric Weber agreed.
“We were a little rusty because
of spring break.”

Pitt, however, picked it up a
notch when the game got close
and scored six unanswered goals
in the second half, putting the
game out of reach.

Leading the Panthers’ charge
was Stember and Josh
Gochnauer, who punched in four
goals apiece, while Watters and
Weber went to the well two
times each.

Goalies Mike Shiner and Brian
Hackford split time in the net,
and both played impressively.

“This was clearly not one of
our better performances,” Neft
said, “but hopefully we got some
of the kinks out."

five walks, three doubles
and six singles. Little was
moved to DH this year
because of his slugging
power and ability to make
contact with the ball.

Kirk Domanick went 8-
23 with two doubles and
six stolen bases and Greg
Trimbur had a team-high
12 hits for the week.

Incidentally, the Panthers
have recorded more stolen
bases in their first nine
games this year than in all
31 games played last
season.

“This Pitt team is going
to be very aggressive," said
Domanick.“We’re
adjusting to the new—style
baseball Coach [Mark]
Jackson has brought here.”

teams in the Hall's bracket which
fill that bill — Virginia and
Arizona. Fortunately for P.J.
Carlesimo, those two will play
each other before one of them
faces Seton Hall.

Virginia could be one of the
teams facing an early exit despite
a good seed. Nebraska, North
Carolina State and St. John’s are
in a similar situation. But I don’t
expect the same from Michigan
State.

True, the Spartans were
inconsistent and even
disappointing at times, butl think
they will be pretty successful in
the NCAAs. Of course, they are
placed in the West Regional,
which is the strongest division
this year.

As a last offering, I expect all
the Big East teams to win their
first-round games, and I predict
that three will make the Sweet 16:
Syracuse, Seton Hall and
Connecticut. Just don’t ask me
why.

Bulls

Continued from page 8
lead to 8-3.

The Bulls pulled to within four
at 9-5 with a little more than ﬁve
minutes left in the game. The
Bulls pulled their goalie, hoping
to score a few quick ones to
make it close. As it usually does,
this plan backﬁred, as the Wings
scored a barrage of empty-net
goals. When the dust settled, the
Wings were up 14-5. The Bulls
then inserted their backup goalie
to stop the bleeding, but it didn’t
stop Lou Delligatti from tallying
Philly’s final goal with S4 secohds
left in the'"contest.

The Bulls’ Butch Marino
knocked in two goals on reserve
goalie Pat Carney with 35 and 24
seconds left in the game to give
him perhaps the most
inconsequential hat trick in
history.

Marino said Eliuk is the best
goalie in the league, despite being
in his first season. “We had lots of
greatshots on him. He just turned
them away,” he said.

Bulls Coach Dennis Wey
agreed, saying, “Eliuk had 10
saves in the first half that were
phenomenal. Normally, six or
seven of those would have been
goals."

He played amateur box lacrosse
in Vancouver for the Brumaly
Lakers, a team Bulls’John Wilson
and Brian Nikula have also played
for.

“It took him a while to warm
up, mainly because of the big
crowds, but he’s used to it now
and has really come around,”
Evans said.

With the victory the Wings
move to 4-4, one game behind
the Baltimore Thunder in the
American Division. The Wings’
final two games are with the
Thunder, so by winning them
both they will earn the right to
play the Detroit Turbos for the
MILL championship.

The Bulls fall to 2-6 with games
remaining at New England and at
home against the New York Saints
on March 23.

Israel

Continued from page 5
aspect of daily Israel life. Israelis
are accustomed to hearing ﬁghter
jets.

On Jan. 14, 3 a.m. (our time),
the declaration of war was
announced. It was not a shock,
just painful to hear those words:
war. We all huddled into a room
and fell asleep listening to the
news. We didn't have to work
that day.

Jan. 18, 2:30 a.m. — a day I’ll
always remember. As mentally
prepared as we were for the
word “war” no one was prepared
for the missiles. Not even a lot of
the Israelis. We received our gas-
mask kits days before, never once
anticipating opening them. At this
time the siren sounded (an eerie
sound), and we could hear the
explosion of the first missile.

Scud No. 2 landed when we

were outside. A sound, a feeling,
a sight I can’t relate. We were
outside, running, our destination
being a sealed room. The whole
story about our rcactmns, again,
is too long to relate. Seconds later
we realized we should be wearing
our gas masks and broke open
the now fashionable boxes. I
now feel an expert, but at that
time it was very confusing to put
the masks on. Your mind just
races. Ironically enough we bcga n
our first Hebrew class that
morning at 8 a.m., and all day
smiles still encompassed
everyone’s faces. The next
evening was a replay; the only
difference was that I awoke in a
family’s sealed room. We took
family photos with our masks on
and actually had fun. During the
raids the radio, TV and outside
blare a siren.

I have noticed changes (eating
and sleeping) in our group, KUS,
since the war. There has been a
slight change in all. It’s not
horrifying, though. That is reality;
we are still quite relaxed, quite
calm, and when the siren blarcs,
we don’t panic. Life is as usual. It
is inevitable to be affected and
quite amazingtowitncss strength.
I honestly sometimes forget that
there is a war. I am much more
fearful for soldiers; every time
the missiles fall my heart drops
—— not for me but for the soldiers
(of the world) and innocent
civilians.

The Israelis are not ﬂeeing, are
not running. They are not just
“dealing.” They are strong and
prepared. To see the citizens react
and why they love Israel and
believe in this land is enlightening.
It is a time of need, and they are
a unified people right now. It is
my opinion that that is a cor-
nerstone of their survival -
Israel’s survival. Life is never
perfect or utopian or always

- happy, but it is important to be

proud because that isn’t easily
shattered. Here I have learned
the miracle ofa smile, the healing
power it has. Ifone cannot smile
he is more vulnerable to fear and
anxiety.

Something missing from courtroom drdmo. Class Action

By Ross Pasquale
Staﬂ“ Writer

Michael Apted’s C1assActz‘on is
ostensibly a courtroom drama,
and the added twist is that a
father and daughter square off on
opposite sides of a class—action
suit. However, the film focuses
more on the paternal relationship
than the legal action. This isn’t
necessarily a bad thing, except
the results are somehow

' unsatisfying.

It’s being touted as “this year’s
Presumed Innocent” by some
critic, and that’s a model it need
not strive for. Presumed was a
skillful adaptation of a colorful
courtroom potboiler, and Class
Action just doesn’t fit into the
same category. Action’s concept
sounds interesting enough, and
adding years of unspoken hostility
to the relationship of Jed Ward
and daughter Margaret “Maggie”
Ward should only be more
compelling. Yet there’s something
missing here.

Jeb (Gene Hackman) is a liberal
lawyer in his own practice, famous
for the political causes he’s
supported over the years. Maggie
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is
an ambitious associate at a big
law firm who sleeps with her
boss (slimy Colin Friels) but
doesn’t want his help
professionally, hoping that the
case she tries against her father
will put her on the “partner
express.” Maggie’s mother

(Joanna Merlin) is the long-
suffering woman in the middle of
led and Maggie’s lifelong conflict.
The mother’s sudden death and
the upcoming courtroom battle
add fuel to the fire in the Ward
family.

I was expecting a gripping
courtroom thriller (a la Presumed
Innocent or Witness For The
Prosecution) and instead was
served a family drama. That would

be OK if it were at all believable.
Hackman and Mastrantonio are
watchable enough, and both have
reps as powerhouse performers,
but the characters, lines and
scenes that they’re given just don’t
do them justice. I think the
problem is most evident in an
earlyconfrontation scene, during
which I had to keep reminding
myself that their characters were
related. There really isn’t a spark

or bond between the two, no
matter how likable they are.
The case revolves around a
defective car and the people who
have been injured or killed
because of the defect —— even
though the manufacturer was
aware of the risks and did not
recall the car. The manufacturer
is a client of Maggie’s firm, and
she has to defend them, while
her father’s small firm sues the

company on behalf of the victims.
Mastrantonio gets to play an icy
barracuda here and excels at it-
She’s just as tough as she was in
The Col0rofMoney and 779eAbyss
but has twinges of guilt about her
behavior. This makes a nice segue
for eventually uncovering the
corruption in her workplace, dirty
deeds of her boss/lover, her moral
dilemma over the case itself and

TAD: Mountain men from hell

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

If there’s one band that best
exemplifies the pure, seething
fury of Seattle’s Sub Pop label,
it’s TAD. These guys grew up
right along with Sub Pop, spewing
theirdemonicsludge and shaking
the shit (literally) out of their
fans.

Frontman Tad Doyle (his real
name is Thomas) claims that the
band attempts to reach a certain
decibel level that causes people
to lose control of their bodily
functions. I-Zveryone has their
goals!

Rounding out this mountain-
man quartet are 'l'ad’s buddies
Gary Thorstensen (lead guitar),
Kurt Danielson (bass) and their
newly acquired drummer, Ray
Washam.

lt’s unfortunate that Tad’s
enormous size has often
overshadowed the band’s
accomplishments in the eyes of
many critics. Thorstensen
elaborates: “There are the two
standard questions: ‘Are you guys
the next big thing? (Hah! Hah!
Hahl)’ and then there’s the ‘Was
Tad really a butcher?’ question.
Yes, to both of those. [laughs]

“This whole phantasmagoric
image of chain saws and the
press escalation of redneck rock
or whatever you want to call it,
the flannel-shirt thing,”
Thorstensen  a bit dismayed.
“A lot of people accept it as such
when, in reality, there are a lot
more facets that we bring to it."

TAD has bludgeoned its way
through two l.Ps, an IZP and a few
singles. God’5Hallswas the band’s
first attempt to reach nirvana.
With its monster-truck guitar and
T‘ad’s angelic growling, this
testament to noise fell short (a
million miles or so) from being
holy. With tunes like “Sex God
Missy,” “Satan’s Chainsaw” and
“Nipple Belt,” you know it wasn't
a big hit with the PMRC or CCD
classes.

The Salt l.1'c/eIiP, T/\I)’s next
tasty outpouring, was a suitable
follow-up to Gods Balls, even if
it shied away from the “religious
references" and plummeted into
the realm of fantasy. “Wood
Goblins” and “Axe to Grind” leave
nothing to the imagination
though, due strictly to their brutal
power.

8- Way Santa, TAD’s most
recent release, continues the
monolithic agony. The years of
experience have given way to a
more polished sound, but there's
no doubt it’s still TAD. If the
sound doesn't do it for you, the
quirky song titles surely will
“Giant Killer,” “\\"ired God" and
“Trash Tnicl~:” are just a few of
the deeply philosophical tunes.

For the most part. inspiration
for TAD comes from the rugged.
rural areas surrounding Seattle.
That and rock ‘n’ rolls lifelong
counterpart, SEX!!!

They’re mean, noisy and
pornographic, all formidable
qualities, but the most important
aspect of TAD, is originality.

“We tn} not to listen to things
as an influence as much as gust an
enjoyment away from what we
do,” says Thorstensen. “\\;“e’ve

on our own volition instead of,
‘Well, here’s the new Sonic Youth
record; maybe we should try
something that sounds like this.”’

TAD is a force to be reckoned
with. Don’t miss it this Tuesday,
March 19 at the Upstage Lounge.
Don't forget to bring a change of
underwear!

The Didji

Illinois’ psychohappy Didjits grace the Upstage Lounge on Wednesday.

s: Whowcm

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

    

HornetPinata (Touch and Go),
the title of the third LP from the
Didjits, is aptly named. lt’ll leave
a scorched guitar buzzin’ in your
ear and a kooky, stinging feeling
in your brain.

This psycho-happy trio from
Illinois had its start in 1984 when
brothers Rick {guitar/vocals) and
Brad (drums) Sims teamed up
with Doug Evans (bass) to add a
touch of lightheartedness to the
somewhat wom-out genre of rock
‘n’ roll.

Fed up with fellow musicians
who were “rediscovering” the
‘70s, the Didjits set out to revamp
rock ‘n’ roll, concocting a satirical

and sort through the 19503, for
which they held great admiration.

The Didjits bebop/rock through
Hornet Pinata with the grace of
a swarm ofSouth American killer
bees. It’s poignant and fun music
with just enough of an edge to
pound your fist to.

Don’t forget the Didjits’ warped
sense of reality as well. Tunes
like “Cutting Carol” and “Hooly
Ghouly” fit right in with their
tribute to Evel Knievel.

There’s even some righteous
cover action with MC5’s “Call Me
Animal” andjimi I--Iendrix's “Foxy
Lady.” I know everyone’s been
covering Jimi a lot recently, but
the Didjits do the guitar god justice
with a little twist of its own.

The Didjits have been giving it
their all for the past seven years;
still, the masses have yet to
appreciate their efforts. With three
albums and a few singles, you’d
at least peg them for an alternative
hit, but even here the Didjits have
found only minimal success.
Maybe it’s time people took notice
of what’s good for them.

Regardless, the Didjits are out
to have fun. Whether it’s abusing
the audience just to get some
reaction or wearing bright yellow
feather boas, they demand
auenuon.

The Di djits will be performing
at the Upstage Lounge on
Wednesday, March 20 at 7:30
p.m. Local faves the Pleasure
Heads and the Cavemen from
Oklahoma will round out this all-
ages bash.

Pitt holds
Ci spring
symphony

Lane Hornfeck
Staff‘ Writer

The University Symphony
Orchestra, under the direction of
Kypros Markou, is holding its
spring performance in Bellefield
Hall on~Monday, March 18, at
8:15 p.m.

The concert will be comprised
of Beethoven’s Overture to Fidelio
and Schumann’s Symphony No.
/i in D minor.

“It is the most challenging
program the orchestra has done.
It is the sort of program one
would expect to hear ifthey went
to hear the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra,” said Markou.

The orchestra is featuring Tina
Faigen, a Pittsburgh Concert
Society winner and Passamanek
Award winner, as the guest soloist
for the piano concerto.

According to Markou, Faigen is
a Pittsburgh native. Faigen has
attained a bachelor of music
degree from Oberlin Conserva-
tory of Music, a master's degree
in music from the University of
Miami, and a doctorate in the
musical arts from the Candidate
University of Miami.

Markou has been strengthening
the orchestra by hiring more
professionals to support thinning
sections.

Markou hopes that this spring
performance will be the highlight
of the entire season.

Greer maintains a great respect
for artists who are good at their
craft, and after 10 years of violin
lessons, she says of her move to
radio, “Ifl couldn’t play, then I'd
play those who couldplay. ”ihat‘s
my art.”

Originally coming to \2t'*'P’l‘S as
a high-school intern in broadcast
journalism, Greer soon switched
over to the musical aspect of
‘WPTS. “When I came to W'P'l‘S
and saw how rotation worked,
what vast pools of music were
out there and what we weren’t
seeing all the time, well, I thought,
that’s kind of what I want to do.
The stuff that we play now has
such potential, yet it’s still
confined to college radio.”

Of the types of people that
work at \V’P'l'S, Greersays, “When
y<t>t,i liste n to us, you’d think there
must be 16 billion skinheads or
punk rockers with hair sticking
out to here. 'l‘hen what happens
is perhaps you’ll see horncboys.
‘r'ou‘ll see people who are in-
between up here. ’l'liey all have
this one thing in common
—-rnusic,”

Although Greer comes from a
\=ery diverse backgrotmd, she
l”eels that she hasn’t encountered
much racism at Pitt. ‘‘I’d like to
think that I didn’t enter Pitt to
fulfill a quota,” she said. “My
personal philosophy is, if were
ever going to get past this race
issue, if we’re ever going to get
past the discrimination issue, we
should stop calling ourselves
black, white, green, blue. We
should look past that and get on
with things.”

Greer, whose heritage includes
Choctaw, African-American and
Irish, used to get “put off when
people would assume that I like
rap music. They act as if there is
something completely wrong with
me because I don’t particularly
like it. I’m sorry,” she says
laughing. “I don’t know the words
to Public Enemy.”

Greer is passionate about such
issues as censorship, illiteracy and
voter apathy. “We don’t have
people that can read; we don’t
have people that will vote, and
Fm thinking, how can you just do
this? ‘x’e’ve got a lot of problems
going on, and no one realizes
that they do have a voice.”

blah blah blah.

Somewhere around here I
fell asleep (while Maggie found
it in herself to “do the right
thing”), but I never doubted
that she would. The script
allows her no ambiguity and
doesn’t color any of her
nuances to make them look
like anything more than
inconsistencies.

Hackman is hailed as one of
the great American actors of
our time, but I feel like he’s
sleepwalking in this film. lie
doesn’t seem to have any fun
patronizing his daughter with
lines like, “Come on, I’ll buy
you some ice cream,” after
kicking her legal ass in court.
The heart of the tale is
supposedly a conflict, but it’s

neither an intriguing one nor
an involving one. Their deep-
seated problems are all
attributed to his unfaithful
ways, but I don’t think that
provides enough motivation
for Maggie’s intense hatred.

Maggie’s change of attitude
toward her profession and her
father are at the center of the
emotional action. She’s been
trying to be nothing like her
father all her life and discovers
that her conscience has been
hibernating as a result. She
comes to grips with her father
and herself.

As for big—screen efforts, I
hear Presumed Innocent will
be out on video soon, which is
exactly the medium in which
to see Class Action — if at all.

Choy, ]r., and bass player and
associate producer of Tbis-n—7bat,
Dwayne Dolphin.
7bis—n-7‘battniIy lives up to its
name. It is a collection of lots of
different styles of jazz, with lots
of different tempos and lots of
different sounds. Each song is a

new idea, a creative thought
played through by the band and
further expanded upon by a
tremendous set of soloists. “When
you listen to an album, it’s like a
journey. People should hear the
first song and ask themselves,
‘What’s next?’ "

Continued from page 5-9

Although Greer thought that
the gulf war was necessary, she
maintains that the peace
protestors had every right to voice
their opinions. “I think war is just
as much a part of peace as peace
is a part of war. You can’t have
one without the other.”

As station manager next year,
she’s not planning any artistic
changes. “WPTS is fine as it is,”
she says. However, she would

also “like to see an increase in
diversity in the musical style."

There are no plans to have new
curtains or flowers at \‘<'P'l‘S. “.\'o
we’re not going to paint it pink,
and we're not going to change
the rugs.” Greer would like the
station to maintain its hard edge
and encourage airplay of bands
like Babes In Toyland and Afghan
Whigs for those who are into
“melodic noise."
