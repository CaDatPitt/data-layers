’-i Discuss Campaign Issues

 

by PAUL STOLLER "

The outstanding topics of
Tuesday’s debate between
congressional candidate
Richard Thornburgh (Rep.)
and Bill Moorhead (Dem.),
the incumbent, concerned
who would be the most effective
Congressman for Pittsburgh and
the relative merits of the alleged
Democratic Party machine. The
debate was co-sponsored by the
University chapters of the Young
Democrats and Young Republi-
cans.

Speaking first Thornburgh com-
mented that the people of Pitts-
burgh have been ruled by the
Lawrence-Barr machine. “My op-
ponent,” he stated, “is part of
this machine. I am_ ﬁghting
against the machine,” he contin-
ued, “and nobody has picked me
for this job. People are disap-
pointed. I want effective two par-
ty government.” Thornburgh con-
cluded, “I promise I will not
leave this city physically or emo-
tionally.

Countering Thornburgh’s posi-
tion, Congressman Moorhead
cited the Pittsburgh Renaissance.
Moorhead pointed out that the
great improvement in the condi-
tions of Pittsburgh was due to a
fusion of the Democratic party
and the business community.

Moorhead reiterated that he -and
Mr. Thornburgh agre on almost

" all the pertinent issues. “Because

of this agreement,” he stated,

“this election boils down to who
will be the most effective repre-
sentative. A freshman congress-
man is not effective in Congress.
Effective congressmen need ex-
perience and seniority.”

Moorhead concluded, that he
has the experience and the sen-
iority to be effective in Congress.
Supporting his position of being
effective, Moorhead stated that
he was on the Civil Rights Bill
Steering Committee and was cur-
rently the regional vice—chairman
in the Democratic Party.

Mr. Thornburgh retorted by
stating that he Wasn’t satisﬁed
with Congressman’s Mo0rhead’s
performance. “Mr. Moorhead’s
reference to senior,” he stated,
“doesn’t mean much to me. I can
do a better job,” he stressed, “be-
cause of my independence of the
power structure.”

H‘ IT ISN’T often we get a
"good laugh here at this Uni-
versity of ours. Let’s face it,
this is a relatively humorless‘
campus. But every once in a
. while a ludicrous situation
«arises when we can throw
_ our heads back and laugh
. ,.until’ we go limp with ex-
' haustion. Such a. case is Earl
, Trent‘ and Company’s out-
frageously expressed demand
__ -that Martin Luther King be
-’_" driven to Pitt in a limousine
I rather than a mere Mustang.
' ’ When the initial laughter
’ subsides and the tears are
1. _ -drying on our cheek, we can
.‘ examine this situtation more
I’  closely. ‘
 Does Dr. King have a.n
" ’ aversion to sports cars? Does
Ford discriminate against
Negroes? Do Negroes dis-
criminate against Ford? How
crude of us to ask such im-
e pertinent questions.
, For those of you too so-
cially unaware to ‘realize it,
 a Mustang,” says Trent of
HEP, “is a cheap sexual sym-
' ‘bol, and is associated with
3 the popular vulgarity of the
"lower echelon of the white
. community.” Earl Trent con-
 tinued, saying, “Negroes are
V ‘tired of going to the white
power structure and explain-
g ing what and how things
1 should be done.”
’ AND HERE is where the
joking stops. «
Strictly speaking, Dr. King
~ was not a guest of the Uni-
-.versity, but of the student
Public Affairs Committee of
f the Student Union Board.
The committee alone is re-
sponsible for transportation
for its invited speakers. It

plaining about being attacked at night in the Oakland area. What secur-
ity will be provided for men walking back to their dorms at late hours?

The administration will be quick to tell us that We are strong young
men and should welcome this opportunity for exercise. But the evidence
is before us that such isolation does hinder freedom of movement and
activity. Case in point is the students of the School of Engineering. No
one would deny that most of them stay “up on the hill” and rarely come
down to participate in activities on the lower campuses. Because of the
physical separation, the inter-action between the School of Engineering

The University of Pittsburgh is a school known for many innova-
tion in academic construction. The Cathedral of Learning and the Towers
;dormitories are two examples of “firsts” in the educational world. How-
ever trying to construct two campuses within the same city seems a lit-

That is exactly what the proposed dormitories will mean. High,
fihigh upon that hill the male students will become isolated from the re-
mainder of the campus. A second type of commuter student is being
created by having men eat and live inan area which is separated by a
"steep incline from the rest of the campus. _
I  The proposed dormitories show a total disregard for any progressive
educational planning. The cite is utilitarian and ignores the effect the pos-
itioning of the dorms will have on student inter-action. Those who decided
.on the spot should have projected themselves into the life of a man living
___in the proposed residences. If his classes are in the Cathedral during the
-‘day he,will not be able to return to his room in between classes to rest or
‘study. He will not be able to have meals with his girl friend living in the
dorms because she will be stationed at one cafeteria he at another. He

cause of the long climb. Even now student apartment dwellers are com-

does not consult the admin-
istration of the University
in these matters. Previous
guests of the committee such
as Theodore Sorenson an-d
Bernard Fall have been driv-
en in a lowly Mustang, as
will those to follow. The
committee was under no ob-
ligation to arrange for pre-
ferential treatment for Dr.
King.

But it doesn’t really mat-
ter in what vehicle Dr.‘King
was driven in; what matters
is the demagogic tone of
Trent’s demand.

CONCE'RINGING Trent’s
outlandish statement of “the
popular vulgarity of the low-
er echelons of the white com-
munity,” we can only won-
der what the white HEP vol-
unteers, those not brain-
washed into constant degrad-
ing of their own race, think
of their leader now.

It seems s-ome how incon-
gruent that one who so de-
precates whites could defend
the interests of Dr. King,
who is dedicated to the goal
of white—black amity and co-
operation. ‘ i

It seems somehow impos-
sible for one to be sincerely
interested in gaining full
equality for Negroes, when
one plans to make a separate
trip to the airport so that
King could decide “whether
he wants to ride with the
Whites or the Blacks.”

It seems somehow strange
that a federally-subsidized
organization with the avow-
ed purpose of aiding under-
privileged children of a pov-
erty slum section should be
run by an individual who ap-

and the Liberal Arts students has been minimal. In all probability the

pears to detest the very so-‘
ciety which the organization
is supposedly preparing those
children to enter.

No one who speaks so ill
of white society could hon-
estly work within the frame-
workof that society to
achieve his ends. Trent’s
hysterical pronouncements
bear the mark of a revolu-
tionary,-in that he does not
seem to seek a reﬁnement of
the system, but Ta radical
metamorphosis of it. ‘

LAST MONTH HEP was
instrumental in bringing to-
gether for a projected series
of ‘ panel discussions on so-
cial issues such ra-dical
groups as the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Com-
mittee, Students for Peace,
Students for a Democratic
Society, Committee to End
the War in Vietnam, and the
communist W. E. B. DuBois
Club.

It is reasonable to ask
what an educational organi-
zation such as HEP has to
do with this conglomeration
of leftists and socialists. And
we can also legitimately ask
if Trent’s off-beat ideology
is representative of the
views of the University Ne-
gro community.

In the face of Trent’s pro-
test, a University limousine
was provided to pick up Dr.
King at the airport. It will
forever remain an opprobri-
um on the administration of
this University that it spine-
lessly allowed itself to be in-
timidated into obeying the
dictates of such_ as Earl
Trent.

Pitt Field House
Cited for Concert

Editor, Pitt News:

In the Wednesday issue of the
Pitt News under the headline
“Homecoming Tickets Go Quick-
ly,” Michael Weingarten was
quoted to say, “Due to the lack
of University facilities . . .”Might
I ask why the ﬁeld house was
not engaged?

This facility could accommo-
date all who wished to attend
the concert and the cost would
probably be less than that for
Carnegie Music Hall. Perhaps Mr.
Weingarten could look into this
possibility, if he has not already
done so. The ﬁeld house was used
several years ago for a broad-
casted “Hootenanny.” It worked
then, why not now?

residents of the new worms would follow the same pattern, making the
minimal number’ of trips to the lower campuses.

The proposed area would be a good location for student in the health
professions (because of the nearness to the Health Complex). But it is
a disaster for students studying in the Cathedral, Langley Hall, Clapp
Hall, and the Hillman Library.

To those who would say thereis no where else, we say better not 12-0

gross effects upon student life and could be deleterious to the whole edu-
functioning at the University. /

the total cause of this. The rea-
son is that the process was not
carried far enough.

When the Pennsylvania legis-
lature decided to ﬁnally come
around and give some economic
aid, they should have made a
provision for ‘maintaining its
standards. By charging out-of-
state students the astronomical-
ly higher amount more as they
are doing, they are telling them
that the State of Pennsylvania
doesn’t want you and that we
have no respect for you. I don’t
feel that this will be rernidied

either. With an election coming .

up the legislators want to tell the

.voters that they will be saving

them money.

It would not be nearly as ef-
fective if they were to tell them
that they want to make a great
institution of higher learning in
Western Pennsylvania and it will
cost them more money. The re-
sponsibility is up to our admin-
istration. If they want this to be-
come an outstanding institution,
as it has the potential for, they
will have to do something about
it. If they remain lax they should
rename the school “Pittsburgh
Community College” for that i
what it will become. ‘

COLLEGE COMPUTERIZED DATE MATCHING EXPERIMENT.

Now is your chance to participate in the latest in college -computerized dating experiments, DATAMATE. This latest

computer‘ application is being used on college campuses all across the country. It has received national acclaim in LOOK,
LIFE, TIME, and other major publications. DATAMATE is not a date bureau. DATAMATE is a comprehensive program de-
signed to provide adventurous college students with a new way to meet new and interesting people. Think of the pos-
sibilities! From the thousands of students on your campus that participate, our IBM computer will pick the six who best

suit your description of an Ideal Date.

iHow Does It Work?

In order to cover the costs of programming, coding,
card punching, computer time, clerical help, advertising,
printing, postage, etc., we are forced to charge a small
participation fee of three dollars. When you receive the
results from this program, we are certain that you will con-
sider this small expenditure to have been worthwhile. The

Association

Plans Study

Anthropologists from col-
leges, universities, research
organizations and govern-
ment agencies will assemble
in Pittsburgh for the 65th
annual meeting of the Amer-
can Anthropological Association.
From November 17 to 20 at the
Hilton Hotel those attending will
present and discuss more than
250 papers concerning various as-
pects of anthropology, archaeolo-
gy, and cross-cultural research.

The Thursday-through-Sunday
meeting will consist of 48 serni-
nars, symposia and ﬁlm presenta-
tions. Among those will be two
sessions on “The Culture of the
Schools” (Thursday, 2 p.m.) and
“The Culture of Poverty” (Fri-
day, 9 p.m.).

Films made by anthropologists
ruring ﬁeld studies are scheduled
dealing with various aspects of
human culture, mostly among
pre-civilized peoples, or animal
behavior relevant to the study
of human development. Two plen-
ary addresses are planned for
Saturday afternoon at 1:30 p.m.
on the subject of “Cultural and
Social Change.” They will be giv-
en by Professor Max Gluckman
of the University of Manchester,
England, and Frederik Barth of
the University of Bergan, Nor-
way.

The presidential address, giv-
en by Professor John P. Gillin of
the University of Pittsburgh, will
conclude the Association’s meet-
ing. He will discuss the purpose
of anthropological studies.

SG Passes Measure
On New Student Union

(Continued from Page 1)
in the discussion of the Alloca-
tions Committee bill.

The measure resolved that SG
“establish a committee of four
senators to review and criticize
the operations of the Allocations
Committee and make recommen-
dations if it is deemed neces-
sary.” Sen. Cowell pointed out
that “the question has been raised
as to the basis on which the

money is being distributed.” He A

added, “None of us are saying
that there is a legitimate prob-
lem, but there are legitimate
questions and we dont’ have the
answers.”

Cabin countered this by ques-
tioning the “weak rationale Cow-
ell presented. The criteria ques-
tioned were presented time and
again here these past two weeks.”
Cabin reiterated the Allocations
Comrnittee’s basis for allocating
funds: the merit of the program;

\

the purpose of the organization;
its current program; the size of
the group; its sources of support.

After discussion on the pros
and cons of the bill, Sen. Dina
Natali proposed to table the meas-
ure, and the Senate concurred
by a vote of nine to ﬁve.

“Brain Drain” Poses Problem

 

British Study Issue of Scientist Migration

by ROBERT ZAVOS

The‘ “brain drain” or emi-
gration of scientists, engi-
neers, physicians and other
professionals from their na-
tive lands has not only cre-
ated problemsfor underde-

veloped nations, but also for once
great powers such as Great Bri-

‘ tain.

At Tuesday’s informal Grad-
uate School of Business Seminar,
Dr. James A. Wilson discussed
“Science Migration from Great
Britain and Its Implications.” The

talk was based on research he re-
cently did in England for his
doctoral dissertation.

He began, “During the early

and middle l950’s, articles and
letters began to appear in the
popular press and professional
journals which mentioned that
the “brain drain” might be more
han Britain could bear, that it
was increasing, and that it in-
cluded some of the most gifted
persons from Britain."

Except for a quantitative ac-
count of the “brain drain” by the
Royal Society in 1963, the Bri-
tish haven’t done much to study

the problem. Dr. Wilson quipped,
“It was ironic that an American
had to go to England and do this
study. especially with his own
funds.

“The central idea was to go to
the migrants and let them ex-
plain their own behavior.” Dr.
Wilson constructed a detailed
questionnaire and received re—_
sponses from 517 “hard” scien-
tists (mainly physicists and chem-
ists). '

The results were very signiﬁ-
cant. “The ‘brain drain’ is not
only bad, it is worse than I had

thought,” noted Dr. Wilson. Re-
sponses to the many questions
indicated that scientists were
leaving Britain for the reasons
which had been hypothesized.
Speciﬁc categories where a ma-
jority of the sampled British mi-
grants noted large gains in Amer-
ica included: “Working condi-
tions,” “quality of research

equipment,” “annual income,” op-’

portunities for advancement,”
"‘intel1ectual stimulation,” admin-
istrative freedom,” and “ﬂexibil-.
ity in work organization.”

The implications are quite clear
to Wilson. Britain is losing large

numbers of her top scientists and
professionals at a time when she
cannot afford this. “Britain has
lost an Empire rich in raw ma-
terials and is unable to raise
more than half of her own food.

Immediate consequences in-
clude the loss of the ﬁnancial re-
sources which Britain has “in-
vested” in the education of a Bri-
tist. Dr. Wilson mentioned that the
moved to the states to use his
education. While nobody can ac-
curately calculate the cost of pro-
ducing a single Ph.D., the ﬁgure
certainly runs into many thou-
sands of dollars.

Another Day

Parseghian Planning

Really Big, Big Score

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

If the Marquis de Sade were alive today, the only place
where he would want to be is South Bend, Indiana on Satur-
day. In his wildest, most perverted dreams, the founder of
sadism couldn’t have created a more satisfying situation.

The situation is Notre Dame’s homecoming, pitting the
best college football team in -the nation against one of the
meekest Panther teams in this University’s history.

Last year it was Pitt acting as the homecoming host.‘

Of course, it's all relative but the Irish were much weaker
then than they are now and the Panthers had more talent

. .. ., then than they do now. Notre Dame score-d
almost at will in a 69-13 rout. It could be
, worse this time around. Much worse.

From the reports coming out of South
Bend, evidence indicates that Ara Parse-
ghian will attempt to establish a new Norte
Dame scoring record. The old one was set
in 1905 when the Irish defeated American
Medical, 142-0.

In that game after a 25 minute first half,

with Notre Dame leading, 121-0, the second
half was shortened to only eight minutes to permit the Doc-
tors”stime to eat before catching a train to Chicago. The
Irish scored 27 touchdowns, but missed 20 extra points.

Parseghian has established a record for himself of
malice toward all and charity toward none. This weekend
toss in a little bit of bitterness with that malice.

The Irish coach has a personal score to settle with
schools in Pennsylvania and it just so happens that Pitt is
the only Pennsylvania school that is on Notre Dame’s sched-
ule.

The reason for the grudge centers around Terry Han-
ratty, the sophomore passing phenomenon of the Irish.
Many people, especially Joe Paterno of Penn State, have
come out in public with the statement that Hanratty’s high
school academic record couldn’t have gotten him into a Penn-
sylvania school. ’ _ .

' Parseghia.n has taken the comments as a personal in-
sult to his recruiting practices, which he shouldn’t have be-
cause the stories are true. But he also resents the way Han-
ratty has been singled out for national castigation and in
this resentment, Parseghian and Notre Dame are completely
justified. ‘ “

While officials connected with Pitt have never said any-
thing about the Butler High product in public, Notre Dame
will probably want to pile it on anyway.

“And they’re in a position to do it,” says Dave Hart.
“I realize Parseghian is pretty bitter and I imagine they’ll
try to put on a good show for theirvhomecoming fans and
try to make mincemeat of us. And if our boys lay back the

 

Z

- least bit they can do it.

Hart is going to try to turn on all of his personal charm
in an effort to hinder the impending slaughter. “I’m going
to see Ara before the game and try to be as nice as I can,”
said Hart.

While Frank Carver is also pessimistic of the outcome,
he’s also reminding people that “Pitt has played some of
their best ball against Notre Dame at South Bend.”

In the meantime it is highly doubtful if the Panthers
will be mentally ready for the Iris-h. Hart says that he ex-
pects them to act like men and not mice. But neither men
nor mice can stop a superhuman and Notre Dame is super-
human this year.

Booters
At Home
Vs Akron .

Last year, the booters com-
piled a record of 7-1-1, and re-
ceived a bid to compete in the
NCAA Championships. This year,
with most of that squad retum-
ing, even better things were ex-
pected of them. ‘

Before the season began, Ak-
ron soccer coach said that the
Pitt soccer team and Michigan
State were in a class above the
rest of the teams the _Zips meet.
In light of the fact that they
meet six of the 16 participants in
the NCAA championships, this
statement cannot be taken light-
ly.

But tomorrow when the boot-
ers host Akron at Forbes Field
at 2:30 p.m., they will be “ﬁght-
ing for respectability,” according
to coach Leo Bemis, and the Zips
will be trying to beef up an al-
ready meaty record.

For, Akron comes here with a
9-1 mark, the only blot being a
close loss to Michigan State, while
the hooters enter the game with
a 2-5-1 chart. And the Zips will
be a big favorite to further stain
that already poor record.

For the booters, tomorrow is
their last chance to redeem them-
selves. “At the beginning of the
year,” says Bemis, “we worried
too much about the NCAA’s. Then

when we lost those two games ‘V

early, we had a letdown.

“But if we beat Akron, we can
square the season. Then we'll
know what we can do when we
play up to our potential.”

Defensive Forces Face 

Heralded Soph Combo.

by GIWRGE LIES

Quite a few football people consider Notre Dame, the‘, 

Panthers’ opponent tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. EST, the best
college team in the country. Dave Hart is one; -scouting
coach Bill Lewis is another. Added to that is the fact that
Saturday is Notre Dame’s ‘homecoming.

Offensively, Notre Dame attacks from anyone of 30 1...,-.

offensive sets. “And how to defend against them is cer-

tainly a problem,” said Lewis, who works hand-in-hand with C 

the defensive backfield. .
The highly publicized exploits
of the sophomore passing duo of .
Terry Hanratty to Jim Seymour’
has given the Irish one of the

try. Seymour, who has caught
ﬁve of Hanratty’s 61 completions
(out of 112 passes) for touch-
downs, may miss the game due
to an ankle injury. He had miss-
ed last week’s Navy game.

“Without Seymour, Hanratty
did not use the long scoring
pass,” said scout Lewis. “But thus
far, Hanratty’s had the ability to
come up with the big play.”

The big play is something which
has been lacking from the Pan-
ther offense this season, especial-
ly since the injury to ﬁrst-string
quarterback Ed James against
Army. Tomorrow Bob Bazylak
starts at the signal-ca11er’s posi-
tion, and he may be troubled by
the Irish defense.

His best game against Syracuse. ‘ff,

protection.”~

“They play a three-deep, man-
to-man secondary, but they have
not really been tested,” said Lew-
is. “The reason is opposing teams
seldom get a receiver deeper
than 20 yards. _Their opponents’

they’re not going to lay back and

Away to the headlines; the ath-
-letes who work just as hard and
as long as the Heisman Trophy
winners with far less recogni-
;tion? Athletes like Larry Hubner.
f Larry Hubner is on the cross-
country team. He is the kind of
athlete you never hear about. His
:-sport is always buried in the one
“corner of the sports page which
football leaves blank. Even rel-
xwatively obscure players on teams
‘like the Pitt Panthers get more
publicity than one of the top ﬁve
_'distance runners a university has
“to offer.

_ But at the moment, the cross-
-country team is the only win-
-ning team this university can
ﬁeld. The reason for this is ath-
letes like Hubner: athletes who
grind out mile after mile in the
. very personal kind of torture
I only a distance runner knows.

the working core of a winning,

team in not a second rate, but
a secondary sport. They do their
job well in a quiet, unobtrusive
way while others monopolize the
limelight. ‘

Hubie is not without his share
of headlines, though. In high
school, he tried cross-country to
get in shape for the basketball
season and became the 12th best
in this state. Then he traded
baseball for track and wound up
the third best half miler in the
WPIAL.

A runner who receives schol-
arship. offers from places like
Miami of Ohio, Tennessee and
Wake Forest isgnot exactly an un.

oﬁer,‘ but if it can’t be the fame,
is it just the money that makes
Hubner run at least ﬁve miles
almost every day of the year?
“When I was a freshman, I

used to say it was just for the.

money. Butathen one day Frank
Handelman and I tried to ﬁgure
out how much we were getting’
for each mile we ran. Dollar for
for dollar, it’s just not worth it.”

Instead, Hubner gives the al-
most universal reply of all run-
ners, “I can’t say why; I just like
to run.”

Out there in Schenley Park,
grinding out the miles when most
people are eating dinner is one-
fifth of the only currently suc-
cessful team that this university
can boast of. No one is taking his
picture or crowding around him
with microphones, but Larry Hub-
ner hasvhis own quiet, but very
real and very worthy area of
success and accomplishment.

Photo Consultant Speaks At Clinic

Irving Lloyd, a foremost yearbook photographer and ex-World War II fighter
pilot, will be featured as the keynote speaker at this year’s annual Owl Yearbook Clinic.
He is the author of Creative School Photography and Yearbook Photo Journalism as
well as an innovator in yearbook design. Aside from these, Mr. Lloyd has many other
duties and responsibilities. He is a photography consultant to the 1967 Owl as well as
to the Scholastic Editor of N.S.P.A., and is the official photographer to Scholastic , Roto

magazine. In his sparce spare time, Mr. Lloyd travels across the country giving lectures
on photography, yearbook design, and co-ordination of photography and typography at
high schools and colleges, just as he is doing for the Yearbook Clinic.

Five Judges
Pool Scores
In Critique

The University of Pittsburgh
Critical Service for yearbooks is
unique in the history year-

‘book contests in the country.

A team of judges grades books.
Each judge evaluates a separate
category to insure objectivity.

A photographer will judge pho-
tography. He‘ can evaluate quality
as well as the problems in devel-
oping and printing the negative.

A writer judges writing, not_

only by studying work in other
yearbooks, but by testing the

writing against his experience as

a reader of literature.

Judges are concerned with the
quality and effectiveness of pho-
tographs; the consistency and in-
terest of copy; the use of attrac-
tive but modest photo and copy
layout. the comprehensiveness
of potent in describing school ac-
tivities and academics; and the
use of common sense in the or-
ganization and development of
the book.

Earl Fischl and Roy Meckler, the men in command of

« ,the 1967 Owl, are the co-ordinators of this year’s clinic.

Their best effort was put forth in presenting this enjoy-

able and educational program on all phases of yearbook
production, design, and development. '

Fischl, as editor of the 1967 Owl, has his hands full try-
ing to co-ordinate photography and copy into a complete
and unique picture of life at Pitt this year. In looking for
new mediums in which to make the 1967 Owl unique, Fischl
is planning’ on using line color and process color. He also
wants t-o expand this year’s Owl and make it a record of all
of this year’s classes, not "just a yearbook for the seniors
with little to offer the rest of the student body. 9

After working on the Owl staff for three years, Earl

‘ Fischlwas appointed to his present position of Editor-in~-

Chief in March of 1966. During his years of staff member-
_ship, ,~Earl has held such impressive positions as Layout
Editor, Production Editor, and Associate Editor for the
1966 Owl. " -

Roy Meckler, in his sec-ond year on the Owl staff, has
attained the position of Business Manager. He previously
had been Publicity Director for the 1966 Owl. Roy is aspir-
ing for record sales this year. He ‘hopes that by initiating
group sales (30 copies of _the Owl sold in blocks at the cost
of $5 a copy) he will achieve this goal. By increasing his
publicity campaign with two “Owl Weeks” instead of just
one, Roy hopes to improve Owl sales and make 1966-1967
the best year ever for Owls. '
