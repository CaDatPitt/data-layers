CHANCELLOR WESLEY POSVAR

Posvar Suggests Tuition Hike I

BY BILL MOORE

The first firm administrative
statement on‘ the possibility of a
tuition hike next year was offered
by Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar in
a Pitt Update released yesterday.

In ‘the Update, Posvar said Gover-
nor Milton J. Shapp’s budget
proposal will have ‘grave impact’
on the University.

“If there is no major increase
from the state,” Posvar said, “we
shall face the necessity of ﬁnancial-
hardship for all, including the
possibility of a substantial tuition
increase.” . ~

Prior to Posvar’s statement, Uni-
versity administrators admitted '
only the fact they were studying a
tuition hike, but offered no, com-
ment on the likelihood of one.

Posvar, in the Update, said- the
University would work hard to
obtain increased funding from the
state legislature.

 Students May Prevent

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

‘ In compliance with recent federal
legislation, Pitt students will be
given the opportunity to prevent
the release of private information
normally included in a campus

_ f"‘,f" ectory, Judicial System Coor-

 

dinator Alden. Bowen announced
yesterday,

\

The law, entitled “The Privacy

Right of, Parents and Students,”
allows the University to publish
“directory information” on stu-
dents- only after they have received
the opportunity to object to listing
personal data. I

According to Bowen, all students
may indicate their objections to the
release of information in a special
datarelease form_av_ailable in the

 yogi’?-ilirregistration office (G-17 CL),- the
C student records office (M-218i

Scaife Hall), the General Studies
office (464 CL), and the Student
Affairs office (104 SU). The forms
"will also be made available at the
Pitt News pickup point on the
ground floor of the Student Union
and in the offices of undergraduate
advisors.

“If a student feels he doesn‘t
, want certain information, including
his name, to be made available for

publication, he should fill in “this”

_ &i'm,” Bowen said.

“At the very,

‘ .ea‘st there will be a computer

  
   

printout made up with information
on each student for next‘ year.”

State Appropriation Fight

Coordination of efforts between

increased appropriations from the
state legislature was agreed, on

expected need. I

“The administration is going to do
anything they can to get that

Pitt Police Drinking .|nciclentCondonecl     1

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
Several on-duty Pitt Campus Po-
lice officers drank alcoholic bever-
ages with the approval, of their
superiors at a private‘ going-away
party for a departing colleague

‘ held on campus two weeks ago,

The Pitt News has learned.

The incident was exposed,follow-
ing a investigation of charges made
by individual officers who deplored
the activity, which is strictly pro-
hibited by the force’s code of
conduct. & '

In an interview last Friday, Cam-
pus Police Chief Charles (“Curt”)
Graham admitted okaying an ar-

~rangement where on-duty police

' ofﬁcers could leave assigned posts '

’ during their lunch breaks, go to the
Trees Hall party, enjoy ._a

_ “But,” Graham asserted, “both
myself and’ Lt. (Joseph) Walker
were present at the party at all
times to insure that the officers did
not abuse the privilege, so that
nothing would get out of hand.
“If that had been the case,”

Graham continued,’ ‘-‘the officers .

would have been dealt ’.with
according to the established disci-
plinary procedures.”

By all accounts, not more than
eight on-duty’ officers drank an
alcoholic beverage at the party,
which was held Friday Febrary 28
in honor of Stacy Schmitt, a young
officer who left the department for
the Pennsylvania State Police.

Reports vary as to how many
drinks each officer had, but Gra-

“We may never getxto see the

Satinoff said. i V

SGB president Larry Platt gave
partial agijeementto Satinoff, but
stressed the importance of working
with the Chancellor. ‘

McManus suggested the drive to
influence state legislators be aimed

at “achieving some sort of parity

with Penn State and Temple.”
Both State-related institutions,
Penn State and Temple received
substantially larger appropriations
increases in Shapp’s proposal.
"The political clout of _Philadel-
phia is usually viewed as three
times that of Pittsburgh. or Alle-
gheny County," McManus offered
as explanation. , *
(Continued on Page 2)

There were no reported disturb-
ances, horseplay or other problems
resulting’ from the party, but one
officerdid say although he did not
drink, he visited Trees Hall about
eight different times while he was
on duty that evening.

Patrolman Arnold Tarr was one

officer who condemned the on-duty
drinking incident.
A “I’m leary of management's de-
cision to approve drinking by
on-duty police officers regardless
of what they drink or how much
they drink,” Tarr said.

“Now that this has happened, -I
wonder how supervisory personnel
can ever take disciplinary action
against any officer who is alleged
tobe under the influence of alcohol

- while on duty,” Tarr added.

“There are three variables that
will affect ROTC,” Roehm said.
"One is no credit, the — second is

third is our failure to make contact

“There is a hostile relationship

other members of his force con-
curred. that the department has
neither a history nor a problem
with on-duty drinkers. Only one
such incident arose in the past
year, he said.

Graham said he .is normally a

disciplinarian when it comes to

misconduct on the part of police
personnel, but believed the friend-
ly nature of the going-away party
warranted a relaxing of the stiff
guidelines that moderate the con-
duct of police officers. _

“It seemed to me thatuwhen you
have a nice.affair such as this for a
fellow officer who is leaying the

said. '

Reflecting on his approval of the
affair,‘Graham said, “It probably

_ was not a wise decision.” He said

he would never approve a similar
arrangement again.

The party began on the Friday
evening aLapproximately 10 pm,
lasted until 3 am Saturday morn-

Ziegler, offering no excuses, said

this time he is cancelling’ his entire
lecture tour. ' ,

“We just got a call yesterday
saying he was unable to speak
here, that’s all,” a" Student Gov-
ernment programming committee
representative said last night.

Ziegler was slated to receive
$2500 for his speech here entitled
“The Presidency and the Press.”

“proﬁting from his role of decep-

ated in the turmoil of the 60s when
students decided the ceremony was
no longer necessary.

Yesterday’s event was the third
Tap Day since its re-establishment
in the quieted 70’s.

Main speaker Helen Pool Rush,
an elder statesman at the univer-
sity, offered modern students
remembrances of past Tap Days
and their importance. Z

Before her retirement, Rush
served as Pitt’s dean of women,
dean of students, and as the first
woman vice-chancellor of student
affairs. V

“l’ve seen tap days with
thousands of spectators when they
were colorful and glorious affairs,”
Rush commented to the much
smaller crowd in Stephen Foster
memorial, “and it saddens me to
think the tradition could die out.

“Tap Day is not justuseless
ceremony,” she said, “rather it is
an important event honoring fine
students and drawing the student
body together.” ’

Rush reminisced back to days
when women were a rarity here
and commended Omicron Delta
Kappa on electing a woman
member.

“The need for separateness
seems to be gone, and that is
good,” she said. _

In earlier Tap Day ceremonies,
Rush told those in attendance,

‘students were ‘kept in the dark’

about who would be awarded. “In
those days, I saw tearful ‘congratu-
lations and tears of joy when a
student was honored. It was a big
thing for everyone," .she said.

    TOP Day Ceremony Honcrs PiHPushingOn

BY ERIC VAN CHANTFORT

City Council is leaning toward
writing into law the one-way
pairing of Forbes and Fifth avenues
if Pitt's Bernard J. Kobosky has
read the lawmakers’ intentions
accurately.

Kobosky, Vice-Chancellor for
public affairs, reiterated the
University’s continuing support of
the present traffic flow pattern
during a public hearing Tuesday
before City Council. '

He also called upon the city to
deal with “total transportation
problems in Oakland” in the areas
of safety, traffic congestion and
parking. I

The majority of witnesses at the
hearing, including City Planning
Director Robert Paternoster and a
spokesman for Port Authority
Transit, favored the one-way
system. . Among those urging a
return ‘to two-way traffic was the

Oakland Chamber of Commerce
whichpresented a petition carrying
236 signatures.

On the basis of his discussions
with individual councilmen,
Kobosky told the Pitt News, “I

think council will retain the

one-way pair by a pretty substan-
tial vote.”

To retain the present pattern, the
nine lawmakers must pass legisla-
tion. By law, the streets have been
two-way since City Council voted to
end a short experiment in one-way
traffic in October, 1972. However,
Mayor Pete Flaherty never carried
out council’s mandate.

The issue was revived in council
chambers last month when the
Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation asked council to
accept the existing arrangement so
plans for the new Brady Street
Bridge could be completed. The
bridge will tie into both Forbes and
Fifth.

  

cil

While he called the

ultimate solution

the one-way issue.

A spokesman in the City Clerk's  i.
office said the one-way issue will I- 
probably be on Council's agenda 
for its regular Wednesday morning ", 
meeting next week. - V, L

A F 1111 Pitcher of Reality  

BY BILL MOORE «

The time is long overdue for ~
someone to take the initiative and
deﬁne reality.

World scholars have too long
wallowed in the imudhole of
indefinitiveness. Without a defin-
ite set of guideposts, students,
professors and just plain old people
have no way of "really knowing if
they, or their best friends, are real.

The individuals responsible, the
philosophyischolars, have put off
the issue for what seems like an
eternity. Actually it has only been
a few thousand years, but even that
is a long time. ’ f‘ '

Why has it taken so long? No one
really seems to know. Perhaps
deep down inside Nietschze was
afraid if he were to limit reality he
might eliminate one of his children,
or his favorite food, from real
existence. '

Perhaps the problem is a deeper
one. Perhaps the great philoso-

, phers were afraid of being laughed _

at. «

Imagine how embarassed. you
would be if after deﬁning reality
some prankster came into your
office with ‘an illusion which had
been made real’ by yourdeﬁnition. j__

Or imagine the blow to your ego if‘ P
that same prankster skipped into
your ofﬁce with a very real New
England lobster ‘you had just
denied the reality of. Perhaps that
is the reason. Probably not.

It is a fair guess, that the great
intellects just haven’t found the
time. P Between writing books,

‘women ﬁnd themselves at a great
disadvantage. As intrinsic interest

that theopposite is true. If that

Women’s Studies here and now,
perhaps even everywhere now, a
necessity. The women and men

What is sad and ironic is that the

Problems Blamed
On Ethics Void

o the Editor,-

ﬂie purpose of this letter is to
encourage the policy-makers of
universities to consider the inclu-
sion in all curricula of a course
devoted to the study of Ethics.

The cynical might ask why.

Though one can with alacrity point
to the aftermath of Watergate and
the demonstrated inability of
trusted high-level public servants
to show any knowledge of or even
to conceive of a devotion to ideals
above personal benefit, more
fundamentally, the asking of such a
question implies the low priority

that such study is given in our,

society today.

 Letter to the Editor

we've been adversely affected by
them. From an age that rewards
the immoral--be it the peer
satisfaction of the shoplifter to the
Swiss bank account of the crafty
white-collar robber, little else can
be expected.

We have in our age excelled in
developing techniques and tools
that extend our ability to gather
and organize knowledge. These
developments inevitably produced
the capability to better our physical
surroundings. Unfortunately, we
did not concurrently equip those
members of society who were thus
so “improved” with the vitally
important ability to independently
develop values to help them use
their knowledge and power for.
purposes other than forms of
personal gain.

Still, I’m personally hoping a
university setting can offer one last
opportunity for constructive
changes in behavior by providing a
place for the development of
individual values. To be sure, most
students are unconsciously in-

volved in searching for ways that
can aid in personal ethical
development while working within
existing society, but the process is
haphazard at best--too many fine
minds and careers are wasted to
drugs, alcohol and suicide to say
that truly effective ways have been
found.

And many minds not so destroyed
andjust as ignominiously by taking
the path of a “true believer" and
letting others make such value

decisions for them. This large
group might include: converts to
religions, exotic or traditional,

enlistees in the military, those
accepting overly demanding jobs
and perhaps even those who take
willful lovers.

If an educator’s goal is to provide
an alternative to such personal loss
and defeat, then it is necessary to
positively inﬂuence the young’s
behavior now. What’s needed is a
setting that offers a person. a
chance to experiment with different
value systems and feel safe in
doing so. As it is, society expects

certain immoral behavior from all
of us and in normal settings it is
difficult to deviate (and be
believed) even if we chose to do so.

Also, it is beneficial for society if
each of us ﬁnds sound values in
one's innermost self as opposed to
being dependent on an exterior
source--(an organization, a leader,
a slogan, etc.) Society stands to
benefit from such internalization of
values because the individual will
not act in an unethical (and
therefore harmful) manner to
maintain his position, nor would
he, either explicitly or implicitly,
allow others to do so.

This laudable goal has been a
topic of debate throughout history,
but it has reached a fearful
crescendo, with the extended
technological horrors of an Ausch-
witz or a_Mai Lai.

Since we’re all passengers on this
shrunken Spaceship Earth » for
awhile, let's hope the fellows who
find themselves occupying the
staterooms begin to have as much
concern for their fellow passengers

In closing, Lenin wrote, “Give me
the children and l’ll give you the
country in 20 years."

Let the young of today, who are
tomorrow's citizens. be exposed to
more ethics than we were.

he's here and he's looking for
people: those in need and those
who need to help.

Volunteers are always needed to

psychology and sociology students
especially have a good opportunity
for practical experience.
“Psychology students often get a
chance to get professional training

Youth City is O’Neil’s dream— it
has no geographical limits, but
through the City, rejected and
hopeless people of all ages can
come together, communicate and
try to solve their problems.

The idea for Youth City came to
him after a personal spiritual
conversion. O'Neil describes this in
a two-page autobiography.

A former drug addict, 0’Neil was
sitting under a tree in Point State
Park reading his Bible one day. “I
wasn’t there but five minutes,” he
writes,
came over to where I was sitting.
They wanted to talk with me about
the Bible and life. It wasn’t long
before more boys and girls were
sitting around me... I

“Youth City is a visio.n I received
from God in wanting to find some
way to repay these young people
for what they had done for me.”

' At first he worked with teenagers

looking for direction. Now he’s
doing the same with college stu-
dents.

Youth City has sponsored pro--
grams for drug addicts, prisoners
and the elderly. Most recently
0’Neil has been working with
mental patients.

“The mental institutions are half
way preparing these patients for
the community," O’Nei1 said. “But
who’s preparing the communities
for them? We’re helping prepare
communities for former mental
patients." ,

Beside its own work, Youth Cith
also acts as a referral agency for
Volunteers for Allegheny County.
Anyone needing a service Youth
City can't provide will be directed
to the proper agency for help.

Dr. David Brumble, who will be 30
on October 30th, is up for tenure

this year. He must be wondering, ’

What makes me so special? What
my teaching and
personality that makes me an asset
to the. University? .

"Pitt has a marvelously open
English_department," says Brum-
ble. "Since I arrived in 1970, they
have encouraged my development
in many areas such as medieval
and Renaissance literature, and
iconography, S’hakespeare’s works,
and,‘ yes, American Indian litera-
ture. From 1970 to 1972, lhelped
with the “teachers training teach-
ers” program. I’ve also been
translating Dutch Renaissance
works into.'English.

“Before I taught school,” he_

continues, “I had many other jobs.
For a- while I worked on a farm,
doing just about every type of farm
chore there was. From 1962 to
1965, I was a Mormon missionary
in The Netherlands. That?s where I
picked up the Dutch p language.
Every other job I’ve had has been a
steppingstone to. teaching, though,
the profession I love: I

If you re going to have a thunder-

for the Indians to see the west as
the home of the «thunder.beings.”

espansibility to the World’

BY RITA VITOLO
i;,T'he ‘toddler blew into the plate" of

I "candy-colored beads. and knowing

he had got it right, grinned like a

kid gazing at his own reflection.
;“We'_tell our kids you have a life to
 live and a responsibility to offer it
., to-the world," Sister Philomena

’ was saying.

A’ Our kids are infants and pre-
schoolers and preteens, every one
of ‘them in his own world without
‘s‘o"und,‘without carny music, rustl-
ing skirts or train whistles in the
night. Without Brookline’s DePaul
lnsititue for the Deaf, there would
bead world without language for
these children too.

.  ‘ ‘Never just look at your deaf child
 smile,” the nun was saying.
}‘iYou way something. You SAY

Hsomething.” Say something clear-

 ly and naturally so your child can

gsee the rhythms of speech.

I Moreover, you can learn to detect a

hearing loss in your child early. '
'A“ _private academic facility on

Several acres in Pittsburgh’s South

if ‘Hills, the DePaul Institute turns no

[child away——and since 1908 stu-
- -dents have come to the school from
.”~all over western Pennsyvlania and
 from as far as West Virginia.

I-Funded partly by the Diocese of
 Pittsburgh, the school is staffed

"largely by the Sisters of Charity of

I-"'Mother Seton. The state purchases

; .’DeP,aul’s services if no program for
. the deaf is available in‘ the child’s

: own school district.

» g The school takes children as soon
asthey are diagnosed——as early as
,'seven months——and teaches them

~.to. breathe, to lip-read and to

.1

,eventually make their own sounds.

. v

By the end of eighth grade most of
them leave, and leave so well
prepared academically they are
sometimes two years ahead of the
course work in their new school.
Toddlers wearing the ever-pre-
sent hearing harness play learning
games. Students in the primary
and junior high schools attend
regular classes. ‘ School is in
session for the 160 children from
September to June, 8:30 until 3.

“Never pity the deaf child. They
can spot it and they resent it,”
principal Sister Philomena repeats.

The kids are taught they are deaf
and different, but never that they
cannot cope in the hearing world.

The parents need as much help as
the kids, according to Sister Philo-
mena, I so the , school provides

in-home training programs in par-

ent education, where the parents
learn how to further what their
child learned at DePaul.

Forty-two teachers work with the
students day-in and day-out,
roughly one teacher for every four
children. Pitt's graduate Depart-
ment of Rehabilitation and Special
Education also offers two-week
practicums in teaching. the deaf
there.

The school operates on the oral-
aural method of teaching hearing;
the method according to Sister
Philomena, which best combines
the residual hearing they may or
may not have with the voice they
did not know they had. Combining
lip-reading and the use of hearing

aids—and avoiding the use of sign
language—the oral-aural method
teaches the deaf child to speak and
associate in the normal hearing
world.

Students at the school have to join
Cub Packs in their neighborhoods
as part of the integration program.
It was because of the DePaul
Institute that a deaf youngster was
finally named to the South Hills
High School swim team.

“Don't pity, don't spoil and don’t
be overly indulgent )Nith your
child,” Sister Philomena warns

parents. “‘And above all, get him’

to a school early.”

(Continued from Page 6)

tor Dr. Elizabeth Rogoff.

An insurance representative is on
hand at the center every Monday
and Thursday. At the present time,
a new insurance plan for next year
is being negotiated.

“We want the plan to cover as
many illnesses as possible and still
be in reach of the students’
budgets,” said the director of the
Center Dr. Joanne Robinson.

Another service of the Health
Center is Family Planning. Begun
last year, the service according to
Dr. Robinson, “met with a lot of
resistance.” However, for $20, a

student can receive a variety of‘

tests, several .visits with a doctor
and any sort of contraceptive
desired.

In the Mental Health Department,
there are seven consulting psy-
chiatrists. ‘ Individual therapy is
used most often, but Rogoff said
there is interest in forming group
therapy sessions. For a student
without health insurance, sessions
with a psychiatrist run $25 each,
but Rogoff encourages students to
come even if they can’t afford to
pay, as the center can make
referrals to other places for treat-
ment. I / I

This is true for the physical health
department as well. “When a
student is in doubt about comimg
here, he should come anyway. He
can see a nurse for no charge and
the nurse candecide’ whether or not
he should see a physician,” Robin-
son said."

The center also distributes allergy
shots and immunization for trips
overseas. One thing it is not, is an
emergency center. “If a student
comes here with a broken arm, we
do not have facilities such as X-ray
equipment,” said Dr. Robinson. In
cases such as those, the_center will
arrange for the student to be sent
to the hospital. ,

The Health Center is here to take
care of any medical or psycholo-

. gical problems you mayhave. Both

.Drs. Robinson and Rogoff encour-
age students to use it often, and
suggest the care at the center may
be better and less expensive than’
elsewhere. Hours, are Monday-Fri-
day 8 am-11 pm; Saturday 12
noon-8 pm, and Sunday 3 pm-11

New Flicks in Review

BY M.C. PILECKI

Back in «the late sixties every

cinematic hero and antihero worth .
his motorcycle boots was hitting
the road looking for something.

They never found it, of course, but
the search_ was the story. And
usually the same one: young man
tires of old existence and/or seeks

, new one, hits the road and spends

ﬁve or six reels looking for Xanadu.

9,7, It reads sorta like the .personal
7”‘column of the classiﬁed ads."

Feminism came along, and now
there’s a new twist to the old
formula: mother. bordering on,
middle-age hits the road with
snotty little brat to find happiness.
At first, this sounds like ..a.Sleazy'
Rider, but actually it’s the basis for
one of the freshest, most original
movies to come to the screen in
years.

Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore .
is the story of a 35-year-old woman
violently confr'onted with widow-
hood and the necessity of earning a
life for herself and her young son.

1 _ Her marriage was much less than

.¢""~"’+...satisfying, but at least it was
something steady, something
deﬁnite and secure. Now she’s on
her own. '

She sells most of her possessions
and packs what she can into the
family station wagon, taking her
bratty kid with her to ﬁnd her own
Shangri-La, which in this case is
Monterey, California, where she

v»- .>*“spent her childhood. Before,/her
marriage she was a singer, and she
tries to pick up that career in a
small, semi-respectable bar along ‘
the way. While still shielding her
emotions she is drawn into an
illicit affair with a young man
startling like her_ own. dead
husband. When that ﬁzzles out--or
more accurately, explodes--she
moves on. , , '
if-.-,.‘ The next job she picks up is that of ,
'“' a waitress. She hates the job, her
co-workers, and the customers. All
of which are pretty ﬂaky. Then she» I
finally meets’ up with Kris
Kristofferson, a divorced rancher,

and together they resolve the story
and many of Alice's doubts. _

The dialogue is spirited and often
amusing without becoming stilted
or staged. There’s an obvious close
mother-child present behind all the
wisecracks and beratings, with
Alice battling--not always success-
fully--for the upper hand. Alice is
overwhelmingly human without
ever; becoming sticky or senti-.
mental. The characters aren’t
cardboard facades, but real people
trying to hold their own with the
use‘ of those facades.

Ellen Burstyn gives her best
performance as the .title’s Alice
ﬁnding herself and struggling. She
has a very fragile crust of mockery
and pseudo-slickness covering— a
frightened vulnerability, held up-

right by a solid core of strength she I
.didn’t know she had.

Outstanding in a supporting role
is Diane Ladd as the foul-mouthed,
basically good-hearted fellow
waitress. It is the ﬁrst-hate-then-
love relationship between" these
two female characters that give
Alice much of its appeal: women
discovering. they can like "them-
selves and even each other. ’ _

Kristofferson is a good choice for
the male romantic lead, since he
can play low-key (and not much
else) adequately and serve as a
good model for Alice's ideal man.
Despite the billing, Kristofferson
has a rather secondary role, since
part of the ﬁlm’s thrust is that of a
woman being deﬁned by herself
and not by her man. ’

“Women’s ﬁlms” have become a
rarity with the growth of “serious
cinema.” Alice is a film about
women, starring women, and as
such it is _ a rarity in the
male-dominated movie world. But
it is entertaining enough and
provocative enough to be appealing
to a mass audience. We need
more films like Alice Doesn’t Live
Here Anymore.

Actually, women have been found ‘

less and less. in ﬁlms with the

demise of the old standard formula:

“Manteca": Northsicle Bar
    I For Neighborhood Folks

BY B. LAMBL

 A couple -of weeks ago a friend

iii and I went looking for a jazz club

we heard.about on the radio. We

took the 54C to the North Side and
walked to the Mexican War

Streets. Turning down Monterey

Street, we passed a block of

rowhouses with nothing more than

a Pabst Blue Ribbon sign, in one

window to indicate we were in a

- commercial district. But halfway

down the second block, we began

to hear music. A trumpet solo

slipped out into the street as people

came and went. At 1410 we found

a wooden sign announcing

"Manteca."

 “More than anything else, Manteca
is a neighborhood bar. Roger
Humphries established it on the
Northside because he believes-
that‘s the -next Shadyside. For the

The name comes from a Dizzy

Gillespie song and is‘ Spanish for 1

lard. As Humphries explains it,
Manteca is something ordinary and

useful. And that is just the feeling ’

you get the minute you walk in, see
the people and hear the music. "

At nine o'clock the after-work
crowd is still hanging around. A
man mulls over a scotch and milk in
front of the bandstand. Guys slap
each other on the back and holler
across the bar. Later hours draw
more women in furs and men in
leather. Around 11, it becomes
hodgepodge of people: people on
their way to somewhere else stop to
get “in the mood” and to see some
friends, a peddler with two slim
suitcases moves from booth to
booth selling earrings.

The music too is for the neighbor-

- hood people. Most of‘ the songs are

  Beatlemania, No Thanks

For “/vlagical" Memories

BY TOM WASELESKI
About 50 people sit crammed in

the center of the large room. Two.

television screens blip on, showing
the same broadcast. The Beatles
ﬂash across the screens but- the
audience gives no discernible
reaction. This is what remains of
the Beatlemania of the 60's.

The Pitt Video Network’s week-
long showing of Magical Mystery

Tour was a ﬁlm to be viewed by,
‘ anyone who ever seriously consid-
I ered him/herself a Beatle fan.

The 60_-minute production was
originally made for the BBC in 1967
and never reached the US until
several years later when the
Beatles released it to various

theaters for the beneﬁt of charity. .

Only last summer was it circulated
for general distribution,. reaching
Shadyside for a one-week engage-
ment. _ ‘

The story was conceived by the

Beatles during the Sergeant
Pepper era. It involves a group of
Londoners who set out on a bus

tour through the country that_

promises to be a mystical enchant-
ment.

The Beatles are passengers on the
trip, though as private citizens and
not as recognized stars as they
were castin A Hard Day’s Night
and Help!

The film as art fails wretchedly,
and one critic that I can recall
retitled the movie Magical Misery
Tour when it was first released.
There is no consistent story as the
tourists travel from one setting to
another. The screenplay reeks of

tongue-in-cheek humor, too much,

for ‘even the Beatles to pull off
effectively. '- -

Donohue’s_ playing is modulation—,

everything he does is loud.
Perhaps the acoustics in the bar are
partly to blame.

Once in a while they let bassman

Jimmy Suanders out of the back to

solo, and when he does, he makes

the bar throb. He’s like no soloist

I've ever heard. Hepulls notes in
out of nowhere, playing a bass line

that’s- unrecognizable at ﬁrst to

anyone but himself. Then he starts

.compressing the notes-, pulling~

them together, and when he’s
ﬁnished, he’s conjured up a rhythm
you didn’t realize was there.

Every once in ‘a while, John
Humphries, host and bouncer,
leaves the ﬂoor to get-up on stage
 mellow things down. When he
starts to sing, he takes, over the

‘direction of the band from his
brother. His voice is a good jazz
voice. It‘ syncopates rhythms and
changes accents a ‘easily as any
instrument. And he can do all
kinds of tnicks for the audiences.
Hetoys his voice out to the ladies

‘ and winks at the guys. But he hits
hardest with “Stormy Monday.”
The blues he-sings out straight for
all the "people who can look ahead
to Monday morning.

The people keep coming and;

going. Later on some guy gets up
and puts a bi1l-in Golden George’s
saxophone. Be he blows‘ ob-
liviously and the bill ﬂoats up. The
' music stops at 1:30 in the morning,
but the activity in the bar does not,

“Alice” Tops Current Releases

(Continued from Page 9)

May, comedienne and director), is
a nice Jewish girl from Harrisburg
who comes to New. York looking for
love. Instead, she gets laid. That’s
something that Betty Grable never
did, at least in nothing short of
heavy drama. . .. .

But this is a light comic-drama.
Okay, heroines getting. laid in
lighter flicks haven’t been new in
the past ten years. She falls in love
That’s no great
He moves in with her
roommate. Now that's sorta
different. I Sheila sulks off to her
younger sister’s wedding, the
roommate gets pregnant, Sheila
becomes\‘rnore self-sufﬁcient and
conﬁdent, the guy discovers he’s
really in love" with Sheila, but will
marry the roommate for her honor,
the roommate says it’s not his kid,
and---well, you knew you it would
turn out anyway.’

Disappointingly enough,_ Sheila
Levine is based on a fairly
amusing, serio-comic novel of the
same name which bears _Iittle
resemblance to the current ﬁlm.
Actually, the brightest moments in

the movie are those few gems

rescued from the book. For
example, there’s the situation with
the loveless Sheila seeking male’
companionship and ending up only
with Agatha, a love-sick lesbian.
And while Sheila pines for wedded
bliss, Agatha announces he/r
impending marriage--but only if
there’s no chance for her and
Sheila to get together.

Written as a. rather long, fully
explanatory suicide note, the book
was supposedly the female version
of Portnoy’s Complaint, i.e. the life
and trauma of the -Jewish female.
It was one of the bright, original
novel ideas, that somehow got lost

fate not uncommon to many fairly
decent books. As it is, the film
Sheila Levine is rather trite and

over-cliched, even with its rather

tired jokes on New’ Yorkers and

out-of-towners. The actors try hard

to make the story to seem fresh,
but it still turns out like the old
joke, “stop me if you’ve_heard this
before.”

"’ Young Frankenstein takes a story-

that was kind of weird in the first

place and stretches it to_ the _nth -

degree. The tale of Dr.
Frankenstein and his monster has
beendone so many times--usually
badly--that just the mention of the
name brings a snicker. So making
something funny of the Franken-
stein story is really easy (Andy
Warhol did it without even trying),
but making a really good comedy
about it is not so simple.

Mel] Brooks, probably the best
ﬁlm comic mind of our times
‘(Woody Allen notwithstanding) has
handled the task well. While not so
overwhelmingly hilarious as
Blazing Saddles or the high
absurdity of The Producers,
Brooks’ Young Frankenstein is
more solid as a ﬁlm story and
somewhat more subtle . in its
comedy, both probably the in-
ﬂuence of star/ writer Gene Wilder.

Two Bats Run To Detroit

BY RICK STOUFFER
Associate Sports Editor

DETROlT—Months of sweat,
months of hard work and ugh,
months of practice have finally paid
off for two Pitt Tracksters.

Karl Farmer and Chuck Mozingo
have been selected by the National
Collegiate Athletic. Association as
Pitt’s representatives beginning
today in Cobalt Arena Detroit,
Michigan.

’ Farmer will be competing in the

440 yard dash and should be
considered one of the top people in
the event. He has run a 48.5 this
year at the Pitt Invitational and

' again in the Ohio State relays.

"The Golden Flash” is indeed an
exciting individual to watch when
running. Every race is run the

same way—start out in the middle,

of the pack and wait until the

_second lap before accelerating into
the lead.
lmanuever and can psych out many
' an opponent.

It is a smart way to

Chuck “Moze” Mozingo is the
other Panther to make it_to the
Nationals. He has shown continual
improvement through the indoor
season and has been called by
Head Track Coach Jim Banner as a

“ “late bloomer.’ ’

Mozingo will be competing in the
600 yard run, an event which has

i come to be his best this, his senior

year. Chuck still considers himself
a half miler and probably will
become one during the outdoor
season as intermediate distances
such as the 600 are not run on the
larger track.

Both runners were victims of bad
the lC4A Eastern
Championships a week ago.

Mozingo ran his strongest race of
the year and the third fastest time

8 of the entire meet yet didn’t place

in the top six. It was called a quirk
of indoor track but the fact remains
it doesn't make sense.

Farmer on the other hand was
victimized by the overruling of the
referee. who supposedly is in
charge of a meet and can’t be
questioned. ‘

With seven men running in the
finals instead of what the referee
had wanted (six) the group was
split into two with two Seton Hill
sprinters in the first split. This was
a__ serious misjudgment as "the,
Frankics were the acknowledged
sprinters to beat in the race.

Despite the booing and jeering of
all spectators the race was run.

Farmer finished fourth but it took
a photograph to prove he hadn’t
been third.

 

Overlooking the poor showing at
Princeton both runners have been
putting in especially long hours of
practice and both should do well to
highlight their indoor season.

 

  Bowling Tournament
Programming Alternative

The Resident Student Association
through its Recreation -Committee
and bowling league held a bowling
tournament Saturday March 8, to
provide the students with another
alternative to regular program-
ming. The tournament was held at
the Strand Lanes and 'was open to
all resident students.

There was both a male and female
division with the individuai scores

in the male division somewhat"

higher than those in the female
class.

The ‘Zoo’ team copped the top
honors for both the high team
series and the high team game,
with scores of 2355 and 829,
respectively. ‘Originals’ took
second in both categories with
scores of 2345 and 814, respective-
ly. The 7th Floor Terriorizes placed
third in the team series with a score
of 2204.

The 8th Floor Holland Hall team
and the 9th Floor Holland Hall
team waged a tight battle for the
team honors in the female division.
The 8th Floor squad grabbed the
top spot with a high team series of
1427 with the 9th Floor second with
a 1385 total.

The results were reversed in the
battle for the high team game. The
girls from the 9th Floor squad
registered the highest total with a
560 pin performance. The 8th
Floor was not far behind with a

second place total of 528. They also
managed the third highest total in
this category with a 488 pin effort.

Individual totals were also kept to
determine the participant with the
highest series and the highest
individual game. Wesley Beech
topped the list in the first category
with a total of 544 pins. John
Guzzetti and Al Bryce waged a
fierce battle for the runner-up spot
finishing with totals of 533 and 532,
respectively.

Frank Pugliese and Andy Luck
tied for the high game titlewith a
total pin count of 208. Don
Norrington and Gary Homa tied for
third with a high game of 201.

Kim Globin and Debbie Johnson
dominated the women’s action in
the two categories. Gobin proved
to be the mostconsistent of the two
grabbing the top honors for the
high individual series with a 390
total. She was followed by Johnson
and Phyllis Singleton with 365.
Rita Bartnik and Debbie Mando
finished in a tie for fourth with a
348 total.

Johnson turned in the highest
game total when she registered a
score of-153. Joan Mattie finished
just seven pins back, good enough
for second place, with a 146 high
single game. Gobin had the third
and fourth highest individual
games en route to her high series
honors. . She rolled totals games

141 and, 139.

in Madison Square Garden in
post-season play. The last time was
back in 1964 when the Cats didn’t
stay long enough to even unpack.
They wereldefeated in the first
round by Drake, 87-82.

The only member of Pitt's travel-
ing squad who has paraticipated in
the NIT in the past is Pitt head
coach Buzz Ridl. Ridl captained the
1940-41 Westminster squad which
lost their opening game to eventual
champ Long Island. He was the
team's leading scorer that year,
averaging 12 points a game, but
he was physically unable to prevent
the 48-36 drubbing they received.

“I sprained my ankle a week or so
before the tournament and I wasn't
able to score a point,” said Ridl. “I
only got to play about a third of the
game, and I was real disappointed
that I couldn’t help the team out.

“We did give LIU their closest
game of the tournament, though,”
he continued. “We were playing a
man-to-man defense but they
thought we were playing a zone.
There was a lot of talk about the
trouble we gave them with our
zone defense.
pointed we didn’t win, but we
laughed about it [the defense]
afterwards. That could have been
the beginning of the changing
defense.” _

Quite a bit has changed since

-those days of the two-hand set

shot. The NIT is somewhat less
glamorous than it used to be, but
the quality of the teams participa-
ting hasn’t fallen off.

The tournament officials have
lined up a very exciting list of
basketball teams, despite the fact
there were only able to nail down
one "nationally ranked squad in
Clemson, the tourney favorite.

This year’s field is about evenly
matched, and many of the games
should go right to the wire. Pitt and
Southern Illinois can be expected to
put on a fine show, and the Cats are
going to need a top-notch perform-
anceto get through the first round.

The Salukis finished the regular
season with an 18-8 record against
what really couldn't be considered
a high calibre schedule. Southern
Illinois is probably best remem-
bered for the 1967 NIT, their first
appearance there, which ended in
success. Walt Frazier, the New
York Knick’s All-Star guard, led
them to the championship while
grabbing the MVP trophy and a fat
pro contract for himself.

This year’s Southern Illinois
squad also has a single standout
whois backed-up by a group of not
outstanding, but effective team-

his shots. His backcourt mate,
Terry Hines, also has contributed
to the Southern Illinois offense, at a
rate of eight points a game.

The Salukis use three different
forwards with regularity but John
Abrams is undoubtedly the most
productive of the three. He is
averaging ten points and has
assisted Meriweather on the
boards adding just over six re-
bounds.

Either Charles Hewitt or Tim

see some early action.

but is not so big a threat to pull the
rebounds- He has averaged over

average of just two rebounds.

I BYTOM HALL
Senior Captain Mamie Heretick
will lead her team of five

Pantherette swimmers in search of

‘national acclaim this weekend as
they travel to Tempe, Arizona, for
the Women’s National Swimming
and Diving Invitational. For
Mamie, it won't be the first time.
“We sent a .. few girls to the
Nationals last year at Penn State,”
Heretick said, ‘,‘_But this time we’ll

relays, and the 400 freestyle’ relay,

section and the WPIAL champion- I
ship."

The WPIAL‘s were held at Trees
Pool that year, and more or less
sold Heretick on the University of
Pittsburgh. “Pitt has always had a _
good academic standard,.. so I
enrolled here. I didn't really think
about the swimming aspects. of_
Pitt. I didn't even go out for the
team my first year." ’

'It’s been uphill all the way, but a
trip to the Nationals would be the

-peak of any college swimmers

Heretick will swim her own 100:"

200, and 400 yard freestyles
-against the best in the country.
“The competition there will be the

 best I've ever faced, but I can't be
"""""$intimidated by it. Ijust have to go

out and swim thebest times I've
ever done." i '
Like all goodiswimmers, Mamie
started out at an early age-. “I
started swimming when I was
about eight. I took some lessons at
a summer -swimmingclub, and got
to be an alternate for one of their
meets?’ sheisaid. “Well, one time I
got the chance to swim in a meet.
A coach of the YWCA team sawlme
swim in that meet, said she liked by
style‘; and persuaded me to join her
team.” Her tenure at the YWCA
lasted ten years. ,
I Heretick lettered in swimming in

Pitt, she will-be here, but "will have
used up her eligibility. “I'm really
going to miss swimming, traveling
to meets and all. It's hard to get

away from something that's been a .

part of you for so long."

But that’s next year. There are
still the Nationals, All-American
honors, and team MVP of 1975 left‘
for her to enjoy. _

“I really don't know who the MVP
will be this _ year," she said. v
“There are so many people on the
team who deserve it." Excuse me
de.ar, but your modesty is showing.
“Really. I think being part of this

(Continued from Page 12)

Richards are also in double figures
for Pitt, both with averages in the
vicinity of 13 points. Lew Hill has
also come on recently and is a
serious offensive threat.

Melvin Bennett will certainly have‘
his work cut out for him in the
center of the action. He is coming
off a tremendous back-to-back per-
formance in the Southern Division

tourney which netted him a total of ’~

34 points and 33 rebounds as well

as a spot on the All-Tourney team,

alongside teammate Starr.

Bennett had no trouble handling
the smaller WVU line-up and also
butchered seven-footer Clyde Bur-
well of George Washington. But
Meriweather will be a little tougher
for Bennett /-and he will ‘undoubt-
edly need some help from the rest
of the Cat squad. -

" Buzz Ridl may have been in  the .

beginning of the changing defense,
and he also will bring a new style to
the Garden with the Pitt’s ﬂowing
‘amoeba’ defense, which has both-
ered a number of teams over the
past two years. The Cats were not
executing well on defense earlier in
the season, but once the younger
players learned the style, things
got tougher for the - Cats’ oppo-
nents. They will need a good

defensive performance tomorrow,

if they hope to. stop Meriweather
inside and Glenn from the point.

I "If the Panthers should come out
on top tomorrow night, they will
draw the winner of the Clemson
and Providence clash, which is

lot of reasons. We have the best“ scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

is women's sports in general. »And

the spirit and team enthusiasm is

just remarkable. I really hate to’
leave it all.” . I _

The team will undoubtedly hate to
see her go.‘ ‘ ‘

But they will ﬁrst have to get past a
good Southern Illinois squad that is
somewhat taller but perhaps not as
quick. The entire squad is health
and everyone is ready" to play,
unlike the Westminster squad of
1940-41. Maybe this time Buzz ‘Ridl
can come home a winner. v

League East title in five years.

If Dock Ellis hadn’t. broken his
hand late in the season, if Ken
Brett didn’t have bone chips in his
left elbow, if Steve Garvey had
stayed home--maybe the Pirates
would not have lost three of four to
the Dodgers in the playoffs.

Yet it is doubtful the Pirates
contemplated those “ifs” over the
winter. They still had come a long
way.

Despite their ﬂair forextreme ups
and downs, one .1 thing seems
assured, The_ Pirates hit.

They led the majors with a .274
team batting average and 1,560
hits last season, and the home run
fences have been shortened this
year at Three Rivers Stadium. The

Richie Zisk, Pirates’ leader last
year with a .3l3- average and 100.
RBI, is playing this year without a
contract, but ,, his hits still.“ will

Nobody is perfect, and the Pirates
illustrate that on defense, where
they made more errors a year ago
than all but three National League
teams. I‘ - _

 ‘Fro-h Bailey P/r

 

BY JIM SPANOS

Bill Bailey,_ one of three Pitt
freshmen to crack the starting
lineup on Coach Dave Adams’
wrestling squad, is preparing for
the National Championships in
Princeton, New Jersey this week-
end. I

Bailey started the year wrestling
in the 177 pound class, but when
teammate Jeff Minerd was injured,
Adams rearranged his lineup, and
after all the dust had cleared,
Bailey found himself wrestling in
the._l90 division. , .

“I liked moving up,” says Bailey.
“lt’s nice to eat,” he says, and he
can because his natural weight
more closely approximates 190
than it does,l77, so he doesn’t have
to worry about gaining as much.

Taking his 10-7 season’s record
into the Nationals, Bailey com-
ments, "I’mjust glad I’m going to
Princeton. It should be a pretty
good experience.”

Bailey hails from Clearfield High
School, which is just north of State

I ' College, PA State runnerup at 185,

Bailey says. “The sport just grows
on you; l’ve been grappling since
the ﬁfth grade."

He brought an impressive 27-5-1
record with him to Pittsburgh. his
high school team having gone
undefeated his senior year. Cer-
tain changes have taken place since
that time.

“I feel like I’ve improved a lot in
getting off the bottom,” hesays.
“And my takedowns and riding
ability have also improved. Your
first year you just wrestle names.
Maybe next year there will be some
guys l’ll want to get back at.” -

At the Eastern championships "

Bailey placed fourth, his last match
was a loss against Neal Brandell‘of
Yale. -

There will be 37 wrestlers ‘in each
weight class at Princeton, which
means the competition is going to
be especially difficult.

‘‘lf I hadn’t made it to the
Nationals I guess I would have
been dissappoint_ed," Bailey ex-
plains. “I don’t know how I'll do
this year at the Nationals, because

so many things can happen out -

there. _One thing I’m sure of
though, I won't come in 37th.”

Accompanying Bailey to Princeton ,

mﬂtrélknm

ng For ucAA

Rande A

are four other teammates:
Stottlemyer, George Bryant,
George O’Kom, Bill Korth and

Bailey won't be there by himself,
and the enthusiasm of his team-
mates should help him in the tough
struggle at Princeton.
