financein 1966. He received his
B.-S. in Business Administration
and his M.B.A, from Boston Uni-
versity.

Smith holds the rating of Cer-

tilﬁed Public Accountant from
Massachusetts.

He is replacing G. Stanley
Rupp who resigned October 1,
1966. ‘

A University senior was crown-I

monies July 24 at Arnolds Park,‘
Ia. Miss Markie Anderson, a
speech major from Sioux City,
Ia., is now eligible to compete
in the Miss U.S.A. pageant at
Miami, Fla., next May.

Miss Anderson, a tall (ﬁve feet
nine inches), brown-eyed bru-

‘ nette, is active -in the Universi-

t.y’s debate club, a member of
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
and the International Student
Organization. In a recent letter
to a fellow debator, she brieﬂy
outlined her schedule for the
next year:

“. . . this coming year I will
be traveling 75,000 miles in Iowa
alone, I also am to ﬂy to eight
different states ‘for appearances
and may be in New York for
four days.”

Although she will be travel-.
ing extensively, the new Miss

Iowa plans to continue taking‘

courses until she can return to
ﬁnish her education at the Uni-
versity: “, . . I plan to take -six
credits during this coming year
at a local college, but I really
do want to return to Pitt the
following year. I will deﬁnitely
want to be "active indebate. I
enjoyed this last year in debate
more_than I ever have before.”

Hoelscher Announces

Major Revamping
In Engineer Study

(See Ed2'tom'al—“A Job Well Done”—Page 2)

Engineering students at the University will embark"

this fall upon a new undergraduate program of studies, re-
sulting from a two year intensive evaluation of the current
curriculum.

School of Engineering Dean" Harold E‘. Hoelscher reveal-
ed the outlines of the new program to local andiregional
educators and businessmen at a meeting Wednesday in the.
Faculty Club.

The new engineering .program will depart from the tra-
ditional program in two signiﬁcant Ways:

>'I‘raditional1y, engineering students were required to choose
a specialty vvi-thin t-he ﬁeld such as electrical, industrial or metal-
lurgical engineering, early in their initial college program. Under
the new curriculum, all-engineering students will follow a common
program for most of their ﬁrst four terms designed to provide
them with-a strong foundation in seven subjects which are funda-
mental‘ to -all engineering. Durin-g the ﬁnal two years the student
will follow a special area of concentration and will have increasing
ﬂexibility in choosing non technical and technical elective courses.
Upon completion of this eight term program, the engineering grad-
uate will receive the Bachelor of Science in Engineering with an
area or subject of special interest and competence designated.

-> Three new course offerings have been developed as part of
the new curriculum. They include two semesters of engineering
analysis, a two-semester humanities-philosophy course focusing on
communications techniques, and two semesters of social science.

In his address Dean Hoelscher .spoke of the need “for a liberal
yet flexible undergraduate engineering program to provide young
men and women with a ‘strong technical background plus an un-
derstanding of the socio-economic and cultural foundations of our
socie .”

-Students will also participate in a two semester course, Engi-

neering Analysis I -and-II, which introduces engineering techniques

and presents problems which ‘the student must learn to solve
through analysis and a knowledge of and use of fundamentals.

. A series of seminars, a new counselling program and faculty-
guided periodic reviews will aid the student dur-ing his ﬁrst two
years of‘ study. The new curriculum evolved partly in response to
the complexity of modern problems which -h-ave become a primary
concern to engineers.

In today’-s world, for example, creating a mass transit system

_of planning urban development requires the talents of a person

not -only ‘educated and trained in engineering, but informed about
the workings of society and aware of human needs.

The Division of Humanities at the University is currently or-
ganizing a two-semester course for the engineering program ex-
amining the literary and philosophic foundations of western culture
and oriented toward questions of personal and social value.

A major offering for the sophomore engineering students will

groups, with the help of four
very competent senior assis-
tants. I'm hoping that the prob-
lem can be solved with the least
amount. of friction. It’s not go-
ing to be easy, but I’m conﬁdent
that it can be worked out.”
Miss Bilewicz graduated from

the University with a BA de-—

gree in 1965. In 1966, she re-
ceived her Masters in Education.
She taught junior ‘English for a
year at South Hills Hi-gh School
before accepting her present
position July 3.

“I have had -experience with

’ the housing system _at the Uni-

versity,” stated Miss Bilewicz.
‘ I lived -in Holland for one year,
and the Towers for one year. In

both dorms, I was a ﬂoor assis-
tant.” She emphasized that she
wanted to “create a good atmos-
phere in Amos and to give it a
dorm personality of its own,

 

of study as well-asp post-graduate

be a -social science course, still
in preparation. The ﬁrst term
will explore in depth one ma-
jor non-Western culture such as
East Asia, Russia, or Latin
America. In this way the stu-
dent will be exposed to anthro-
pological, economic and govern-
mental aspects of a culture
other than his own.

A team of sociologists, econo-
mists and political scientists

will conduct the -second semester ‘

of the social science course. This
course will survey social institu-
tions such as the family, the
church and the government as
:1 basis for understanding mod-
ern society. Using as background
the ﬁrst semester of work, non-

Western and American Society .

can be compared.

Late in his sophomore year ‘

the student will choose a ﬁeld

"of primary -interest and .enter

one of six departmental advis-
ing programs. He may -also
choose an inter-departmental or

inter-school program such as”

bio-engineering or nuclear engi-
neering. While participating in
these advisory programs the stu-
dent will plan his ﬁnal two years

    

     

 

The new undergraduate program‘: of studies for engineering students
represents the type of thinking that will enable our University to attain

the goals indicative of a ﬁrst-rate school.

The School of Engineering Dean Harold E. Hoelscher has wisely

_ chosen not to ignore the criticism directed towards his area. He and his
A staff listened carefully and evaluated their curriculum. The-ir intensive
examination has resulted in an approach that not only meets the needs
of this specialized ﬁeld but also attempts‘ to broaden the educational ex-

perience of the participating students.

, One of the several excellent ideas emerging from this program is
the two-semester course examining the literary and philosophic founda-
tions of Western culture and oriented towards"‘questions of personal and
social value. This is now being prepared by our Division of Humanities.
Another new -offering is the social science course, which will include

the -study in depth of one major non—Western culture. The second semes-
ter of the social science course will “survey social institutions such as the
family, the church, and government as a basis for understanding modern
society. Using as background the ﬁrst semester of work, non-Western
and American society can be compared.” '
‘ These new offerings represent a real attempt that has not hereto-

fore been made to broaden the engineer’s required courses to encompass
vital aspects of a liberal arts education. Obviously, the engineering stu-

dent is learning a skill that requires much specialization. But this is no

justiﬁcation for depriving him of an exposure to basic concepts in the
humanities and social sciences. We congratulate Dean Hoelscher and his
staff for not only recognizing this fact, but for also incorporating courses
of this nature into the engineering student’s curriculum.

I Other changes that have been announced in the engineering courses
reinforce our awareness of the thorough job done by the evaluation com-
mittee. Two terms of engineering analysis will be offered to introduce’
engineering techniques and present problems “which the studentmust
learn to solve through analysis and a knowledge of and use of fundamen-
tals.” Also a series of seminars, at new counselling program, and faculty- ‘ »
guided periodic reviews will aid the student during his ﬁrst two years. \

These efforts signify the ﬁne attempt that has been made to im-
prove upon theengineering student’s education at this University. Al-
though the new’ program has not yet been. put into practice, it has the

prerequisites for success. We wish the Engineering School luck in carry-

THE RECENT outbreak

must solve and solve now. It
‘i may seem unrealistic to call"
for an immediate solution,
but in fact it is a matter of
necessity, not realism. Time

' community is becoming more
and more impatient with the
turtle-like movement of the
“due process of law.” With
the vast. extension of the

coin, one ﬁnds the rising re-
sentment and disgust of
 white America. Each sum-

lwith reports of death, in-

jury, looting and destruction.

ity.

ALL WILL remember the

troops to shoot them down,

a solution must be found and

found immediately. If the
nations’

energy is spent
quelling riots and ﬁghting
fires none is left to work on
the civil rights problems that
if solved would provide a vis-
ible beneﬁt ‘for the Negro
population. ‘ . .
One’ may ask where the
solution to summer rioting
lies ? The answer is with this
same hostile youth. There is
a direct correlation between
the fact that the riots are a
summer phenomenon and the

' fact that most Negro youths

are out-of school and unem-
ployed. The picture is clear.
A hot city ghetto, thousands
of bored Negro youths with-

.out the money or opportun-

ityto cash in on the swing-
ing Pepsi generation that is
a.dvertised on billboards,
television, and radio. This is
the dynamite that explodes
onto the streets with the
slightest spark.

What is needed is an ex-
tensive, all encompassing,
teenage summer employment
program, sponsored by fed-
eral, state, local, and private
enterprises. It seems clear
that a program of this sort
with substantial wages would

keep youths occupied and»

also put money in their pock-
ets. If properly organized,
such a program could .also
provide valuable training for
ghetto youth. This summer
employment should be so
designed thatnot only those
in school are employed, but

_also so that drop-outs are

affected. Recruiting should
take -place in ghetto high
schools and junior highs in
late April and early May.
Paid training programs could
be instituted by private busi-
ness with future employment
opportunities. In the long
run, the cost of this program
could not even come near the
cost of yearly summer riots.
If every Negro in the ghettos
across America could look
forward to a summer proﬁt-
able in money, in training,
and in experience, he might
be less likely to take out his

 hatred and“ resentment on

The Detroit Riots

The Wrong Way

by Mike Brourman

THE TRAGEDY that is Detroit was most brutally re-
ﬂected by Mrs. Gloria Webb, a widowed mother -of 11, in-
cluding one s-on ]l.1Sl‘, home from Vietnam. Surveying the
ashes that until recently were her home she muttered, “I
don’t know what I’ll do now. I’ve got nowhere to go. What
was this supposed to accomplish?” '

In all of their grandiose dreams of glory, the Ku Klux
Klan could never have hoped to create the shroud of death
and destruction which hangs over so much of Detroit’s Ne-
gro population today. ’ \

And yet, it was not the Klan, nor the White Citizens
Council, nor the Birchers, nor any of the other twiste‘d
groups on the far right which sparked the Detroitholocaust.

INSTEAD IT was a much newer group of perverted
organizations, «collectively known as the Black Power move-
ment, and whose numbers include such groups as RAM, US,
and the Student Non-Violent Co-Ordinating Committee
(surely the most ironically named group since Youth
Against War and Fascism).

They sparked the riots as the opening phase of a re-

bellion which will, according to Stokely Carmichael and Rap .

Brown, eventually burn white America down. If this is their

goal, the early evidence suggests that they are in need of

a new approach.

C In Newark, and now in Detroit, the main victims of the
riots are not whites, but Negroes. Negroes are the victims
in tg physical results of the riots themselves and Negroes
are bound to be the victims in the backlash that will result
out of these senseless horrors. -

TWENTY-SIX PEOPLE‘ were killed in the Newark

riots. Twenty-four of them were Negroes. In Detroit, aside .

from the still untotalled death count, the tragedy has led
to thousands of Negroes being homeless. All that the ﬁre-
bombings by southern night riders failed to do has now

' been done by their black, northern counterparts.

It is true that many whites had their stores looted or
burned, but most or all of their losses will be covered by in-

surance. Few whites were directly affected by the violence;

When their insurance check arrives their loss will be for-
gotten.

them no relief from their new sense of hopelessness. Fur-
thermore, when the white businessman reopens his store,
the chances are that it will be in Grosse Pointe, or some
other safe area where the insurance rates are low, thus even
further isolating the Negro in his ghetto.

WHAT IS needed to remove the Negro from the slums,
is not rioting but legislation, and another sad part of the
aftermath of Detroit is that as long as there is the former,
there won’t be any of the latter. The inevitable white back-
lash has already sprung up, as witnessed in the defeat of
the rat-control bill in Congress. A

When the rat-control measure was proposed, Congres-
sional insiders considered it safe by at least 15 votes. But,
after the riot in Newark, it was nearly laughed off the ﬂoor
of the House, and then was soundly defeated.

The Model Cities proposal, the rent-supplement bill, and
other measures designed to aid the slums are in a similar
state. For all intent and purpose they are dead. And they
will stay dead until the rioting has stopped. -

THIS, THEN, is the dilemma of the Negro. While the
riots may do some temporary damage t-o the wallets of white
businessmen, the main victims of the rioting are the Negroes
themselves. V '

Negroes. are the physical losers, in terms of the dead,

-the injured and the homeless.‘ They are also the political 
_losers in terms of the desperately needed legislation  i I
