inated for election to ﬁve coun-
cil executive board positions.

The council still has one week
before nominations ‘are oiﬁcially
closed, but in the ﬁrst session,
which is ordinarily the most fruit-
ful, only two men, Lou Fox, pres-
ent treasurer, and Mark Bebko,
present vice-president, were nom-
inated to ﬁll the presidential
chair. One man, Morris Fountain,
was belatedly nominated for vice-
president; one man, Jack Cory,
was nominated for treasurer; no
one was offered for the secretarial
post; and only James Masterian
was nominated to ﬁll the ﬁfth
man position. .

Regrets Proceedings

N. Ronald Pease, assistant dean
of men and IF advisor, expressed
disappointment in the nominating
proceedings, and stated that he
‘hoped “personal ambitions” was
not the motive for the poor elec-
tion response.

Dave Woll, council president,
conjectured that the, moving
ahead one week of the nomi-
nations because of Greek Week
might have engendered some
unpreparedness a m o n g the
members.

Though there was slight res-
ponse to the call for nominations,
a motion from the ﬂoor that IF
recognize the new, lower proba-
tion standards of the School of
Engineering and Mines brought
about a division roll-call to de-
cide the vote. After_an undecisive
voice vote, the council defeated
the motion 17 to 7 to accept
E and M's 1.5 QPA probation
criterion. “

Break Tradition

Not an uneventful meeting, by
‘ziny means, IF proceeded to
break a ‘hallowed tradition by
permitting female SG senator,
Beth Baumgard, to address the
council with a request for a $25
donatior toward the sponsorship
of an SG dance scheduled for
March 9. Her request was grant-
ed through unanimous voice as-
sent.

Power’s Sculpture Powerful

By l\/IARILYN EIGES

After three years of sculp-
turing, graduate student Bill
Power is the ﬁrst University
student to have a one man

show in the Fine Arts Rodin"

of the Book Center.

‘ The exhibit, which will continue 1
into February, contains 13 wood-V

block prints and four stone sculp-
tures, representing a cross—section
of Power’s work in 1962. The my-
riad aspects of a city have pro-
vided the stimulus for the major-
ity of his works. In his prints,
Powers asserts he wants to depict,
“an entire city casting its shadow
on one square of cement side-
walk.”
Visual Strength

Power states, “I’ve been work-V ’

ing for a kind of visual strength,
combining the strength ’of stone
with the strength of the city.”
That he has succeeded admirably
can be seen in the surging force
and linear movement of his Mono-
lith 6.

Although he does work in other
mediums, Power considers himself
primarily a sculptor. He defines
his work as being “architecturally
oriented.” .

When questioned on the stimuli

Power feels, “titles are rather

wrongly, and set up superﬁcial"
associations.”

Concerning his work, Power
claims he is not satisﬁed, and pro-

  Geology Department  
Receives New Name

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld announced Thursday
that the Geology Department has been renamed the Depart-
ment of Earth and Planetary Sciences. “The change in name

V and in emphasis is a direct result of advance planning by the

University’s academic departments to incorporate the space
factor in their programs and to coordinate with the work of

the Space Center," he explained?

Dr. David Halliday, dean of the
Division of Natural Sciences and
acting coordinator of the Univer-
sity’s Space Research Center, com-
mented,” One of the main objec-
tives of the geochemistry group in
the department will be to build a
research capability for precise in-
vestigation of lunar materials
and later, of materials brought
back from other planets.”

Double The Size

Th e department expects to
double. its size in the near future.
In the past few weeks, three new
laboratories worth $300,000 have
been completed. The new facilities

graphic laboratory to study the
crystal structure and composition
of materials, an isotope lab to de-
termine the absolute age of rocks
and minerals and to study other
basic isotope problems, and a
laboratory to study the magnetic
properties of rocks and minerals.
The department plans to add a
seismographic laboratory soon.
This fall, the department will
begin a. series of cooperative re-
search programs with neighbor-
ing institutions. With the aid of
the staff \of Yale University
and the ,Bermuda Biological

S t a t i o n, the department
will provide programs in the
ﬁeld of oceanography. It will
also exchange students and staff
with the University of Tokyo as
part’ of the United States-Jap-
anese.Cooperative program on
the study of earth magnetism.
Dr. A. F. Frederickson, depart-
ment chairman, commented, “We

do not intend, however, to neglect‘

the classical problems. For ex-
ample, we have just apointed a
new man in the ﬁeld of paleonto-
logy to insure that these aspects
of geology are given proper em-
phasis.” The department is in-
vestigating computer methods of
handling classical problems and is
offering special training in the
underlying mathematics and com-
puter techniques.

The department of earth and
planetary sciences has already re-
vised its graduate program. It now
includes research in geochemistry
of minerals and organisms, isotope
age dating of terrestrial and ex-
traterrestrial materials, rock, mag-
netism, marine geology, meteorite
and tcktite research, the atomic
structure of minerals and the
physical chemistry of glass and
minerals.

Background of Africa

Heizerling’s lecture deals with

an analysis of the background and
the current problems in"A.frica’s
conflict. Most Africans have no
concept of western civilization
and what is expected of them in
the 20th cent.ury, according to the
Columbia Lecture Bureau.

Beaver College

Joins Concert

The Men’s Glee Club of the
University and the Touring Glee
Club of Beaver College, a small
women’s college in Glenside, a
suburb of Philadelphia, will pre-
sent a joint concert Saturday at
8:15 p.m. in the SU Ballroom.

As part of an annual tradition,
the Men’s Glee Club will cook
and serve a candlelight dinner
before the concert on the 12th
floor CL for ‘the women. In the
past the Glee Club has been host
to singing groups from such
women’s colleges as Elmira and
Wilson. Last year the dinner in-
cluded dishes like chicken par-
mesan, French green beans and
baked Alaska.

Wide Range

Under the direction of Emanuel
Rubin, the Men’s Glee Club will
sing music ranging‘ from the re-
ligious, “Ave Maria Stella”
Griegto show tunes like “Waltz-
ing Matilda” by Cowan with a
baritone solo by Joseph Romito
and novelties like “The Drum-

mer and the Cookie,” arranged by ‘

Scott and featuring a quartet
composed of David Reese and
Robert Jenkins, tenors, Edward
Williamson, baritone, and Alfred
Rich, bass.

Although I would like to be

It was the excellent idea of

In fact, I have only praise and

Their efforts and mine in this

think, an attack on college
smokers. I am not assailing

them but, rather am trying to
help college students accept
emotionally and then act ap-
propriately on facts that most
of them have already accepted,
I believe, intellectually.

It is precisely because of this
intellectual acceptance v -srsus
emotional non-acceptance that I
have approached the matter as

Swetonic’s comments, I know
that people (including Univer-

not rationai.

It is on this lack of rationality
that cigarette advertising seeks
to‘ capitalize, for example.

While‘ I believe that efforts
by the Student Health’ Service
to discourage cigarette smoking

are important — one faculty
member phrased it as “ . . .

Greenwich Village is a place with a glorious
past which is now populated by people past glory.
Let itbe said that the Village has one or two spots
of real color and atmosphere. One of these places
is the Village Gate. H ,

True, this night club has  ' A
made concessions to the popular‘ ;
but perverse demands for high
admission charge’, over-priced
drinks, stale cigarette smoke and
knee—to-knee seating arrange-
ments. But the Gate does have
one drawing card unique among
most night spots: talent. This
alone creates the proper‘ atmos-
phere for the "Hootenanriy.

 

Eai-ly One Christinas Eve

It was‘ Christmas Eve an/d we arrived early in

the evening. "We were seated near the stage at a

checker-board size table which we had to share
with another couple yet, and waited for the fun to
begin. H .

Through the sluggish cigarette fumes ‘captured
in the spotlights came’ the first performer,‘Larry
Adler. He had a harmonica with him. We winced.
We had not come to see a ‘harmonica player. Who
needed a harmonica player? _ '.

We did- In a matter of minutes,iAdler had our’
attention. He treated us to everything from Bern-
stein to Bossa Nova to Each. The latter was played

to a recorded background of_a full symphony with A

the violin solo erased.‘ .

‘Jazz ﬂutist Herbie Mann, an obscenely ser-
pentine man, appeared next and help set, the scene
for the upcoming excitement. Thesextet was not
yet warmed up and their numbers seemed "to be
just music to half-listen to. I was more intrigued
with thehard-drinking man and poutinggirl shar-
ing our, table who, for some still unexplained rea-
son, were -not acknowledging each other’s exis-
tence. .

The’ great folk-singer Odetta finally appeared
and began to warm up the house. I’m afraid the
music critics ‘were correct when they said she 7
can’t sing blues, but her folk numbers .were still
superb, ' ~ ‘V
By the time she had ﬁnished her act, the Vil-

lage Gate was packed and thestage was set for. .

the second show.

Peace Group,s"P|ace . . .

 , Where Is

Larry Adler returned and immediately topped
his first performance. His mouth organ was liter-
ally an entire orchestra in itself. ‘

In the middle of his act, however, a bulky
ﬁgure walked on stage from the audience. It was
Theodore‘ Bikel. The crowd exploded to Bikel’s
fantastic singing and guitar-playing. The I-looten-
anny had begun. , , *

Next toljump onstage was a young man named

. Barry Kane, of the New Christy Minstrels. An ac-

complished guitarist and singer, he joined Adler
and Bike] in songs that sparked hand—clapping and!
polite ‘stamping from the appreciative audience- I

Herbie Mann, however, was not to be outdone.
He arrived onstage and brought sort of a musical
chaos with him. First, only four members‘ of the
sextet appeared. After a few moments, the bass
player managed to make it on stage and, during

_ the first number, the conga man literally stumbled;-I3?

forward. V
This drummer, whose name was, I think, Willie

Bobo, had obviously justreceived an injection of »

some narcotic stimulant. In other words, he had
just popped and was feelingrﬁne. Eyes, fastened
shut, he crouched behind hisvdrug and slowly pick-
ed?‘ up the beat. In the next number, he was given
a solo and seemingly transcended to another world;
itiwas as if all his sins lay on the hide of the
drum as he unmercilessly.ﬂailed it with his knuck-
ly, brown hands. Occasionally, his eyes would pry.
themselves open and a ﬂicker of human expres-
sion would appear on his face. But generally, he
was far and away.

. Bossing ' the Nova

The audience, frneanwhile, was flying, too. The
music rebounded everywhere in ‘the club and, as
Herbie Mann solocd through the remaining bars
of'the Afro-Cuban number, the crowd was" rock-
ing and bopping -with every 'note.

Odetta finallyappeared and, with a strong New,

Orleans backing, belted out several spirited songs. N

Her showing concluded one of those occurrences
so rare in’ the perf.ormin'g arts: an entire evening
ofimagical rapport between artist and audience; a
Hootenanny in the true "sense.

Something,’ too, had happened to the cold couple  f

sharing our table They were now sitting "side by
side with their iarmsiaround each other.

De bate?

By Irv _'Garfinkel ‘

In his talk two weeks ago about The Age of
Overkill, Dr. Max Lerner warned us tha the un-
thinkable cannot and should not" be equated with
the impossible. To illustrate this point he men-
tioned that it was inconceivable
that Germany, possessing one of
the. most advanced cultures in
the. world, could have produced
the Nazi atrocities. Yet the un-
thinkable happened in Germany.

Nuclear war is likewise un-
thinkable. Yet, because a nu-
clear war is possible, we must
seek means to avoid it. As Dr.
Lerner said, the choice is not be-
tween “red or dead.” There are
other alternatives. But it should .
be made clea'r that disar_mament is the only alter-
native to nuclear holocaust. '

Only the U.S. and Russia now have the capa-
city to engage in an atomic war. France," however,‘
insists upon developing an
deterrent. Red China is also in the process of be-
coming a nuclear power. As more nations control
atomic weapons the chances of nuclear war‘ in-
crease. Kennedy and Khrushchev are both rational
men. So is De Gaulle. However, are the Chinese
Communists rational men? If the Chinese were
responsible for making Khrushchev’s decisions dur-
ing the Cuban crisis, we might now be engaged in
World War III.

Don't Leave for Government _

Achieving total disarmament under U-N. guar-
antees is the most important problem new con-
fronting the human race. This is not a problem,
however, which the citizen should leave for the
government. To do this is for the citizen to forget
that he is the government.

It would be easy to say that the Russians are
not interested seriously in disarmament and thus
dismiss disarmament discussions as abstract specu—‘

a good chance that the Russians are willing to
sign a nuclear test ban agreement including on-

Senate would refuse to sign such an agreement.,It.

now appears that Senator Clark "might be ‘right. In’?-'. 

a personal letter to‘ President Kennedy recently
made public, Khrushchev agreed. to accept two
or three on-site inspections a year._ . .

As students about to become voting citizens in a
democratic country we have not only the right but
the duty als_o to become‘ well—informed about the

‘important issues. For democracy can work, demo-

cracy is meaningful, only if citizens can vote in-
telligently. Political debate is therefore vital for
the proper functioning of a democracy. ’

at the University. The peace groups which should-
be stimulating discussion on disarmament are in-
active and disorganized. During the Cuban crisis
some members of the now defunct Student SANE
protested President Kennedy’s policies. Since the
fall trimester began the peace groups have -done
nothing else- — ‘

Should, “Stimulate Debate

Just reacting to situations such as the Cuban
blockade is notadequate. The proper function of a,
group such as Student SANE is to stmulate debate?"
There is no_ doubt that protest marching is a legiti-
mate way of doing this, but is this "the most effec-
tive way? I ‘am inclined‘ to believe that the last
protest march provoked very little thought on the
subject of peace. -

Still, there are questions that need to be dis-
cussed. For example, how much independence will
the US. have to give up to the U.N., or how will
we adjust our economy to compensate for the 50-
to—55-billion-dollar reduction in federal spending .

Not a Murder Mystery

To say, however, that the novel
is basically a murder mystery
would reveal a ‘gross misunder-

purpose.

,In the ﬁrst place, the iden-

Kirst has placed into his novel. .

The amazing thingabout this
simplicity is the fact that it
doesn’t really mater. If Kirst had
withheld the identity of the cul-

’iGroup to Visit
,,'Africa, Europe

The African Studies Group for
‘College Students — a non’-proﬁt
‘—‘New York organization will
sponsor an eight to nine week
tour_ of East Africa and Europe
this summer.
Twelve students will be se-
lected to visit East African tribes
‘and photograph wild animals in
Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, the
' Sudan and Egypt.
"Then the group will spend sev-
" eral weeks in Greece, Rome, Paris
and London. ‘
Part of the African tour will
include a safari into the bush
‘country. The group is seeking

‘The tour will also visit Peace

University students.
Information a n d "applications

the rule to permit all officers ex-

themselves as part of our plan
for a good,-. strong organization
which will be of signiﬁcant help
to headquarters in 1964.”
Donations For Paper

A plan to solicit donations from
businessmen and local republican
organizations to publish a small
paper, perhaps on a monthly basis,
is being worked out. “We might

polls on subjects like Medicare,”
Baker hypothesized.

“Most other college groups like
ours face the same problem we
do, but so far we hope we’ve
made a signiﬁcant advance toward
a solution,” Baker concluded.

Senators Gerry Carlson and
Carol Montgomery reported
at the Student Government
meeting Thursday night that
they had met with Dr.
Thompson of the Student

Health Service and Dr. Maxwell
of the Red Cross Blood Bank to
discuss forming a blood donor
club at the University. This would
organize a regulated blood supply
donated by the’ University tom-
munity and replacement credit
when one of the members needed
a transfusion.

The senate decided -that the
project was “out of the realm of
SG”« when they considered the
necessary size of the operation
and the problems involved.
' .‘ 1,800 Pints Yearly

-Maxwell computed that 36,000
people would ‘be involved includ-
ing the students, faculty, admini-
stration, and their families, and
that according to.national aver-
ages, 1,800 pints would be needed
yearly for the operation.

Carlson and Miss Montgomery
noted first the fact that the ma-
jority, of undergraduates were-
under_ 21 and would need‘par-
ental approval to donate and
secondly that undergraduates

If the thought has crossed your mind that
there's too much of a good thing going around
for engineering students lately, we don’t
blame you. We are making no exaggerated
promises. In fact, we are looking to you and
to other engineering students for promise to
bring to us. There’s a switch!

History's second most signiﬁcant Noah de-
ﬁnes promise as, “Ground for hope, expecta-
tion, or assurance, often speciﬁc, of eventual
success.” Since we are dedicated to the propo-
sition of complete success in all our endeavors,
-—and the less -“eventua. ,” the better—-we are
looking for men of promise.

were covered for blood trans-

fusions under University health
insurance.

Neither Thompson nor SG com-
mitted themselves. The senate felt
that thisvarea could be better con-
sidered under the community
service project.

‘Preview’ Chairmen

SG approved Jacques Werth—
eimer and Ruthie Maguire as Pitt
Preview co-chairmen. Wertheimer
announced Catalano, Bill Dunn-
ing, Nancy Dixon, and'Barb Mc-
Keever as their committee mem-
bers.

Vice-president Judy Dietborn
reported that the committee in-
vestigating the formation of a
-Liberal Arts Cabinet met with

Dean Albert Martin to discuss

distribution of credits. Miss
Diethorn stated that she couldn’t
“begin to tell you how interest-
ed Dr. Martin is” in the pro-
posed cabinet.

Pete Bijur reported that the ID
committee is investigating a plas-
tomatic machine costing $179
which would weld a card between
two sheets of plastic.

The general theme of this
year’s Greek Week, “Creativity in
the University,” will be carried
out in exchange dinners and dis-
cussions to be held Feb. 7 at

Sorority members have also

powerplants, Ford Motor Company engineers and
foundrymen have pioneered new techniques that now
let us cast our engine blocks with such precision that
much lighter engines are made possible.

New materials used to make cores and molds and new
_casting methods enable us to make engine parts with
walls as thick as necessary—but no thicker. This
eliminates weight of extra material which must be used
to provide adequate strength with less precise casting

Reducing engine weight through precision casting
means more performance per pound—and since

Victory Over Army Here, 21-6

o _ By BOB SIVIIZIK
Army fell easy prey to the wrestling team at the Field

matches with Tom Heniff, Frank O’Korn and Jeff Ware cop-

close battle into a romp.

ping their initial triumphs- of the season.
The match was a close one for the ﬁrst ﬁve bouts, with
the Panthersnholding a 9-6 edge, but Jim Harrison, Lee Hall,

Ken Barr and Ware swept the r.e—¢
maining four matches to turn the

Heniff got his ﬁrst‘ varsity win
by scoring an 8-3 win over Gerry
Dernar. Heniff was in complete
control of the match except for
the final seconds when Dernarp
had him on his back momentarily,
but Heniff quickly reversed.

Rode Foe

Heniff gained two-points for
riding time under the new East-
ern rule which gives a wrestler
two-points if. he has two minutes
time advantage over his opponent.

Mike Johnson put on another
outstanding performance as he
outclassed Fred Grates, 16-2.
Johnson had two near-falls and
a predicament on the way to
his rout.

Army copped the 137—D01lnd
match with Ed Winborn beating
Bill Solominsky, 3-0. O’K0rn
gave the Panthers‘ another win
with a 3-2 upset of Ed Sharkness
in the 147-pound bout. O’Korn

riod and then held off the re-
luctant Cadet the rest of the way.

. Carr Bows
Army got its ﬁnal win of the

day in the 157-pound match when
National champion Mike Natvig

beat John Carr, 6-2. Natvig took»

Carr down in the ﬁrst 25 seconds
and then rode him for 5:35. Carr
worked a beautiful pinning com-
bination ‘against Natvig in the
ﬁnal period but the C‘adet man-
aged to stay off his back. V
The Panthers started. their
sweep in the 167-pound match
when Jim Harrison downed
Tom Thompson, 4-0. Lee Hall
followed with an 8-7 win over
Gwen Vaughn. Hall got his
wininng point on riding time.
He had only a 61 second. ad-
vantage.

Ken Barr got hissecond win of
the season in the 191-pound match
at the expense of Tom Cuuning-
ham, 5-0. Cunningham was sub-
bind for Army’s regular Ray
Nickla, who was ill.

Ware made the slaughter com-

plete by scoring a take down with

six seconds to defeat Bob Coul-
son, 5-3. Ware brought delight to
the crowd of, 1,000 with his amaz-
ingly quick escapes which ac-
counted for two of his points. He
also had a point for riding time.

FLYING THROUGH THE AIR with the greatest of ease is surprise
winner, Jack Lehner, having vaulted from the long horse. He rack-

, ed up the highest point total for a Panther in the meet.

Holy-Cross Upsets Cart;
Dartmouth Indians Fall

By ART FLEISCI-INER

Four hustling Irishmen and
a Dutchman halted the bas-

ketball team’s winning streak _

at ﬁve games Friday night at
Holy Cross, but the Panthers
righted themselves and claim-
ed their 12th win _Saturday at

Dartmouth during a two-day
swing through New England.

Holy Cross dealt the team its
third loss, 77-65, while Dartmouth
fell, 70-53.

While Holy Cross’ four Irish-

men teamed up to score 35 points,
the Dutchman,” John Wendelken,
scored 24 himself, 14 in a row in
the second half to change a '50-44
Panther lead to a 58-52 Crusader
advantage.
Difference in Punch

“They were hustling and we
weren’t,” said Coach Bob Tim-
mons. “They beat us to the punch
and that was the difference.”

The difference the nextmgﬁit
was Dartmouth, with a 6-7 re-
cord, had two starters out of
the lineup, and the Panthers
were able to crack the old
stand-by zone defense which
they see so often.

'-Forward Ben Jinks whipped in
22 points on long-jumpers, a good
follow-up to his 17 point per-
formance against Ho-ly C ros s
against whom he grabbed 13 re-
bounds.

Brian Generalovich hit his av-
erage against the Indians — 17
points -— after a disasterous show-
ing at Holy Cross where he scored
six points and handled four re-
bounds. Cal Sheffield led the team
in that game with" 20 points.

Army Upstagues
Gymnastic Team
For Third Loss

Army’s defending Eastern cham-
pionship gymnastic team dealt the
Panthers their third straight loss,
55-41, ‘at the Field House Satur-
day.

The Cadets scored four wins and
four second places in what Army
coach Tom Maloney termed a
lucky win. “It was the ﬁrst away
meet for many of our boys and
Pitt was stronger than we ex-
pected,” he explained.

The winners swept ﬁrst and
-second in the ﬂoor exercise,
still rings, and horizontak bar.
Ken Slutzky scored a double
for Army, winning the horizonl
tal bar and parallels.

Panther gymnasts cavne up with
two wins. Roland James
first in the side horse and Jack
Lehner scored a surprising win in
the long horse, posting the highest
individual score by a Panther in
any event.

Army opened up a 12-4 lead
after the first event and the
closest the Panthers ever got was
at 34-30 after four events.

 His Weight Class

, By BOB SMIZIK
Wrestling had its origin in
agan ritual and the sport
hasmaintained a pagan ele-
ment ever since——sacriﬁce.

f Wrestlers must often sacri-
ﬁce food, study time and
health. This year Ken Barr, a 21-
year-old junior from Clearﬁeld,
Pa., is making an even greater
sacriﬁce.
 arr is sacriﬁcing his pride and
restige.

Glittering Record _
_Competing in the 177-pound
class last year, Barr enjoyed both
pride and prestige in ample help-
ings. He compiled a 7-1 record in
dual ‘ meet competition and was
runner-up in the Eastern cham-
" ionships.

, ‘This year, however. Barr has

little to be proud of, and his
‘presitige is about as high as
 I Floyd ‘Patterson's.
 The main reason for the sudden
‘reversal of form is 14 pounds.
That is the weight that Barr put
" on when he moved up‘ to the 191-
pound division. The raise in
-weight came about when Tom
..l'eﬂ.’ries, the team's regular 191-
“pounder, dropped from school to
support his family.
J “' Gained Nomination

,1 With no other 191-pounder on
the team Barr was nominated to
take over by Coach Rex Peery.
He has not met with success in
his new job as a 1-3 record in-
dicates. ' -
7 Two of the losses and the lone
‘twin came while wrestling in the
g .. heavyweight division, Barr in-
' ‘hen-its this role against teams
s. that don't wrestle the 191-pound
"division since he beats heavy-
weight Jeff Ware in practice.
~Barr could attempt to solve his
roblem by challenging the team's
regular 177-pounder Lee Hall.
;“The Coach doesn't want me to go
d6wn,” Barr" says‘. “I can see his
point. Hall is smaller than I am,
‘too small for 191, and he makes
.177 better than I do."

 Defense Dips

 Being a little bigger than Hall
is no requisite for 191-pound

wrestling, unfortunately. Barr's
defensive record aptly points this

out. Last year in eight matches he
gave up only ten points. In four
matches this season he has had 16
points scored against him.

“The weight is hurting my
record,” says Barr. “I had my
arms around the legs of Mary-
land’s heavyweight, (Roger
Wikander) but I couldn’t take
him down because he was too

Ken Barr Sacrifices Prestige

or Good of Wrestling Team

heavy. Under those circum-
stances in my weight (177-
pounds) I would have scored.”

This is not a pleasant set of

‘circumstances for a wrestler who

was heir apparent to an Eastern
championship. (Barr was the only
wrestler in the ﬁrst four at East-
ems last year who was not a
senior.)
- Bouts Coming Up

The end does not appear in
sight. “I don’t think I’ll go down
in weight this‘ year,” Barr said.
So unless the injured knee’ that
kept him out of the Army match
persists, Barr has a heavyweight
match against Michigan State, a
bout with Lehigh’s John Burns
and another with Ed Pohland of
Penn State, one of the East’s best
191—pounders to look forward to.

Being a. staunch team man,
Barr realizes _his new job is
vital to the team. He hasn't
even asked Peery to let ‘him
challenge Hall.

This does not stop Barr from
looking to next year. Then Jim
Harrison, the team's 167-pounder
graduates and chances are that
Hall, a normal 167-pounder, will
move down. If that happens Barr
may have to sweat off those 14
pounds and return to 177—pounds,
but he probably won’t. mind it
too much. '

 

Defensive Statistics Overlooked -

In Appraisal of Basketball Team

Overlooked in the ﬁne record
thus far compiled by the Panther
basketball team is a solid defense.
A defense which has limited the
opposition to 61.4 points per game
previous to engagements with
Holy Cross and Dartmouth.

Except for a temporary defen-
sive lapse the last few minutes of
the Army game, (the average
would be below ($0. Last season
Cincinnati led the country in de-
fanse with a 57 point per game
average.

During most of the’ present
campaign, Coach Bob Timmons
has used both a zone and man
to man defense. This was most
effective in the win over West-
minster earlier this year.

“We have a good defensive
club,” stated Timmons, but some-
times the team Iorgets about it
when we have a large lead, like
in the Geneva game.”

For the past two years. Tim-
mons has extolled the defensive
ability of Tim Grgurich. “He isn't
that much of an offensive threat,
but when I tell him to guard a
man close, he does it. Against
Army he was effective and got S, /'
two key steals -for us.” ’

demic assistance has been devel-
oped between Washington Uni-
versity and Waseda University in

Learned More W hen H ‘e ~Was Out of School

Ben Jinks Becomes a ‘Changed Man’

By JLVI O’BRIEN

It may surprise many, but .

the turning point. in the for-
tunes of the University of
Pittsburgh,
surprise, and of Ben Jinks,
this winter’s Panther co-cap-

tain, came early in the second half
of the second game of the season,
against Northwestern.

It was a dreadful evening. The
team looked as if it had been Vic-
timized by insomnia. Starter Dave
Sauer had sputtered early and in
had come Jinks, something of an
anomaly—a substitute co-‘captain.

Playing as it‘ he had been living
on benzedrine, Jinks was the only
one running strong at the,,end of
the 57-55 ‘loss. He topped the

Panthers with 15 points, and more -
important, he had regained his ‘:1

starting position. He wasn’t going
to lose it._
Nursed ‘Qualities
E_ndurance, leadership‘ and
pride _had never“ been high on
Jink’s checklist, but they are at a
zenith this trimester. He said he
nurtured these aspects during his
summer vacation. _
Jinks did not play basketball
in the. high—gear competition of ‘
Long Island" playgrounds this
summer. At night he .took an
English course at Hofstra and
by day he worked for his father
in the contracting business. He
didn’t just build bigger biceps.
He looked into himself: a reﬂec-
tion in a cracked mirror. He was
a very complicated young man
with a whole set of personalities,
one inside the other like a nest of
Chinese boxes. There were clash-
ing elements in his nature and
interests. '. ' ‘
Tight—Strung Ball
He was intertwined in domestic
problems and he'hadn’t been the
basketball player that‘ he should
have been. He would come‘ late
for practice last year; his con-
centration - was often dispersed,
and his shooting eye was twitchy
and temperamental.
Jinks though »he might regain
a lost interest in the sport by
abstaining from basketball dur-
ing the summer. This is a per-
iod when most stars sharpen
their scoring ability.
“I knew I wasn’t going to win
a position during pre-season prac-
tice,” Jinks said. “I sort of ex-
pected it. I had what I consider a
poor year during the past season.
I had expected ‘much better things
after what I tliought was a fairly
good sophomore" year. But my
statistics turned. out about the
same as the year before.”
Good Ones Improve
Last year Jinks averaged 12
points a game for a team that re-
corded a 12-11 record. “Good
ballplayers improve,” the 6 foot
3, 180-pound senior insisted.
"But the coach played me just
as much as Sauer in the scrim-
mages,” Jinks explained. "He
could’ve looked ahead,» ﬁguring
Dave would be here another
year. That was enough encour-
agement for me.” A further
stimulant was,injected,' in Jinks

when Coach Bob Timmons
named V him co-captain along
with junior standout, Brian

Generalovich, a. born leader.

Jinks is proud of his achieve-
ments this year and yet he is only
averaging 11 ppg. The telling dif-
ference, however, is that his four
cohorts are also scoring in similar
double ﬁgures and the team is the

Conﬁdent of Comeback

«“I never thought for once that
I wouldn’t be back on the ﬁrst
team,” boasted Jinks. “Dave’s a
real good boy and all. But I have
that much confidence in my abil-
ity.

“I was the main offensive
threat as a sophomore,” Jinks
added. “Now everyone shoots
and they all hit well. I don't
mind not being the standout
scorer (he is fourth in scoring).
I feel as long as I play a solid,
good all-around game, I’m sat-
isﬁed with myself.

“I’ve changed my philosophy as
a ballplayer to fit the mold of the
team,” said Jinks, a hot-shot who
once scored 28 points against a
Lucas-leld Ohio State club. “When
I was -a soph, I thought all you

What do they mean
. . ..scot free? /

had to do was go"out and put the
ball in the hoop -— but there’s
more to it than that.”
‘All-Around Duty

That’s why Jinks tags the game
against William & Mary in the
Steel Bowl as his best perform-
ance He scored 14 points, grabbed

3 nine rebounds (“l’ve never been

known much for rebounding,”
says Jinks) “and held Bob Harris,
a 6—foot, 4-inch senior, who was
averaging 15 poirits, to two points.
“I always assign Ben to the
other team’s best big man,”
-Coach Timmons said. “VVithout
him we wouldn’t be where
we’re at. He’s a changed man.”
Jinks actually was most damag-
ing when he spoiled Westminster’s
tough zone defense at New Wil-
mington, Pa., by popping in 16
points on long jumpers as the
Panthers downed the Titans, then
the No. 1 small college team in
the nation, 61-51.
Rebounder Now
And last week Jinks snared 12
rebounds — a career high —
against Army at‘ West Point in as
tough double—overtime test.
“Right now I think I’m in the
ideal situation,” Jinks conclud-
ed. “Coach is more interested in

said he hopes to establish in
Pittsburgh a model of what a clin-

with. modern methods. “Most of
the present practice in ’ clinical
chemical tests is dated "by 25
years,” Dr. Sobel said.

By putting these tests for pa-
tients on a ‘«mass-productionf
basis; the hospital laboratory
can then fulfill its real role —
trying to bridge“ the large gap‘
between existing knowledge and’
what can be done with the new

tinued; A «

many time-consuming tests, such
as electrolyte determinations, urea,

be done quickly and accurately by
automatic means, given the right

CALPURNIA, HERE I COME‘

_NoW, as the college year approaches its mid—point, one fact

emerges clearly: you are all going to flunk everything.

There are two things you can do about it. Fi1'st, you can
marry money. (I don’t mean you marry the money itself.‘ I
mean you marry a person who has money. Weddings between
people and currency have not been legal anywhere in the United
States since the Smoot-Hawley Act. Marlboro Cigarettes, on

V the other hand, are legal everywhere and are, indeed, smoked
with great pleasure and enthusiasm in all ﬁfty states of the
Union. I bring up Marlboro Cigarettes because this column is
sponsored by the makers of Marlboro, and they are inclinedto

brood if I omit to mention their product.)

But I digress. I was saying you can marry money but, of
course, you will not because you are Ia high-minded, clean-
hving, pure-hearted, freckle-faced American kid. Therefore,.to
keep from ﬂunking, you must‘ try the second method: you mustf

learn how "to take lecture notes.

According to a recent survey, 123.6% of American under-
_graduates do not know the proper way to take lectuije notes. To
Illustrate this shocking statistic, let us suppose you are taking
a course in history. Let us further suppose the lecturer is lec-
turing on the ruling houses‘ of England. You listen intently. You
write diligently In your notebook, making a. topic outline as you

have been taught. Like this:

I. House of Plantagenet.

, II. House of Lancaster. .
III. House of York.

Then you stop. You put aside your pen. You blink back a
tear, for you cannot go on. Oh, yes, you know very well that the
next ruling house is the House of Tudor. The trouble is you

don’! know the Roman numeral that comes after III.

    

er, ‘.
K C-PL. ,‘

 

 

(It may, incidentally, be of some historical interest to point
out that Americans are not the only people who don’t know
Roman numerals. The Romans didn’t know them themselves.
I suppose they could tell you how much V or X were or like
that, but when it came to real cuties like LXI or MMC, they
-]llSIZ~' ﬂung away their styluses and went downtown _to have a
bath and take in a circus and maybe stab Caesar a. few times.

(You may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous

_ numerals when the Arabs had such a nice,—simple system. Well
sir, the fact is that the Emperor Vespasian tried like crazy to
buy the Arabic numerals from Suleiman the Magniﬁcent, -but
Suleiman wouldn’t do business—-not even when Vespasian
raised his bid ‘to 100,000 gold piastres, plus he offered to throw
in the Colosseum, the Appian Way, and Charlton Heston.

(So Rome stuck with Roman numerals—to its sorrow, as it

turned out. One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny got to V

arguing about how much is CDL times MVIX. Well si_r, pretty
soon everyone in town came around to join the hassle. In all
the excitement, nobody remembered to lock the north gate and

———wha.ml-—before you could say pecca fortiter, in rushed the

Goths. the Visigoths, and the Green Bay Packers I)
Well sir, that’s the way the empire crumbles, and I digress.

Let's get back to-lecture notes. Let’s also say a word about

Marlboro Cigarettes. The makers would be so pleased! And is
it not ﬁtting that we should please these honest tobacconists—
these ﬁne men, fond of square dancing, water sports, protein

and tattoos—these tireless perfect-ionists who spend all of their,‘
days trying to please us_—searching everywhere for the best of
all possible toba_ccos,‘ag1ng them with patience, blending them
with tender, loving care? Marlboros are ava.ila.ble in soft pack.
and flip top box. You Will ﬁnd XX cigarettes in each package.
