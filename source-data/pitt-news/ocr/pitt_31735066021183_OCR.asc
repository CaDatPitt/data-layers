Greek
Week y
activities
kick off

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Loretta Claiborne has twice
finished among the top 50 wom-
en runners in_ the Boston Mara—
thon. Last year, she placed in the
women's top 20 at the Pittsburgh
Marathon. She is a gifted‘, deter-
mined athlete who believes in
her athletic abilities.

But 20 years ago, Claiborne
had no self—esteem. People kept
telling her that she couldn't do
anything that ’’normal’’ people

‘ could.

Loretta Claiborne is mentally
handicapped.

”Everyone called me names
like ‘dummy’ and ’retard,”’
Claiborne said. ”They told me

what I could [not do], instead of _

what I could do."

She discovered her athletic ta-
lent through the Special Olym-
pics program. Today, she says she
doesn’t know what she and many
others would do without Special
Olympics.

Claiborne was the guest speak-
er for the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Greek Week opening
ceremonies, which were held in
the Ballroom of the William Pitt
Union Friday night.

This year, the fraternities and
sororities of Pitt have decided to
help Loretta and the 20,000 other
Special Olympians of Pennsylva-
nia in their athletic endeavors
with the funds raised during
Greek Week.

Greek Week is an annual event
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Each year, the Greeks select a
charity to receive the funds
raised. Last year, Pitt Greeks
raised $89,000 for the Western
Pennsylvania School for the
Blind, according to Greek Week
Chairman Ron Bizick.

”Greek Week is -a time for
Greeks to pull together and work
for a chosen charity. It's [not only
a time] to raise money for the
charity, but also for Greeks to
have fun and enjoy the events,”
said Chainivoman Kristen Pun-
tureri.

This year's Greek Week offi-
cially began Friday night with the
opening ceremonies and .will
conclude April 14 with the Greek
Week formal. The goals for this

6 year's Greek Week are to raise

$90,000 to benefit the Western
Pennsylvania Special Olympics

Senate begins minimum wage deba te 

By Erik Kridle
Staff Writer

Debate begins today in the
U.S. Senate on a bill that, if
passed, would raise the federal
minimum wage from $3.35 per
hour to $4.65 per hour over a
three-year period. A

On Thursday, Jay Katz of Pitt's
Student Action Union along with
Bob Anderson, head administra-
tor of the Rainbow Kitchen, or-
ganized a rally and press
conference in support of the bill,
entitled the Minimum Wage

Restoration Act of 1989. Pennsyl-
vania Congressman Doug Wal-
gren and Pittsburgh City
Councilman‘ Jim Ferlo were
among other local labor and re-
ligious leaders who spoke out for
the minimum wage increase at
the rally. .

”This was a very timely ra|ly,”
said Katz. ’’Hopefully, the Senate
will approve this bill, and we

‘won't need to have another one.”

Katz said it is ”tough to say”
what side effects raising the mini-
mum wage would have on the
country's economy. He believes,

                

however, that any possible ad-
verse consequences that may fol-
low the increase have been
”exaggerated” by both the Bush
and Reagan administrations.
”lt’s impossible to raise a fami-
ly on that wage,” Katz said. i
According to Katz, who is also
a member of the National Unem-
ployment Network, approximate-
ly 6.3 million American workers
earn the current federal minimum
wage of $3.35 per hour. Another
10.8 million earn between $3.35
and $4.50 per hour. V
The current minimum wage

has not been raised nationally
since 1981.

Last week, a compromised ver-
sion of the original bill was ap-
proved by the U.S. House of
Representatives. This week, the
bill goes to the Senate.

President Bush does not sup-
port an increase in the minimum
wage without the existence of a
six-month 1’training period,” dur-
ing which time employers teach
their employees the job while
paying them a $3.35 minimum.

Signing performed by Beautiful Hands

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staff Writer

Both the hearing and the deaf
were entertained Saturday night

at the 10th anniversary perfor-
' mance of Beautiful Hands.

The group is composed of var-
ious students from around the
Pittsburgh area who conduct mu-
sical performances in American
Sign Language.

This form of signing, called
ASL, is used in place of signing
word-for-word. Instead, the signs
portray the overall meaning of
what is being said, making it eas-

ier for the deaf to understand.

”The purpose of the group is to
spread deaf awareness,” said first-
year Beautiful Hands member
and Pitt senior Theresa Pikulski.

The goals of the group are to
provide a broader means of ex-
pression for the deaf and to show
that emotions and feelings can be
expressed without a spoken
word.

They have a wide variety of
songs in their productions which
include classics, popular hits,
medleys and religious songs.

Props, dancing and drama are

added to the signing itself to in-
crease understanding of the
songs.

Audiences are encouraged to
participate as much as possible,
enabling them to"learn some sign-
ing themselves.

All of the members are volun-
teers, with the group charging a
small fee for performances in ord-
er to help pay for costumes and
other costs.

Beautiful Hands was started by
Karen Walkney, a Pitt sign lan-
guage teacher who is deaf.

The group began in 1980 as

part of a class project that
Walkney assigned to her
students.

Walkney is a former Miss Deaf
Pennsylvania who, in addition to
teaching, travels continuously
conducting deaf awareness work-
shops and performing.

Walkney serves as the faculty
adviser for Sign Connection, Pitt's
sign language club, which spon-
sored Saturday's event.

Although this was the last per-
formance of Beautiful Hands un-
der Walkney, the group will

Gorbachev visits with Castro in Cuba

HAVANA (AP) — Soviet Presi-
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev ar-
rived yesterday in Cuba for talks
with President Fidel Castro, who
has criticized the Soviet leader's
new pragmatic brand of com-
munism.

Gorbachev’s blue and white
Aeroflot jetliner touched down at
Havana's airport about 6 p.m.
EDT and was greeted by cheer-
ing crowds.

Gorbachev was met by Castro,
and the two stood side by side on
the tarmac as a military band
played the anthems of their two
countries.

In Havana, Gorbachev will
hold lengthy discussions with
Castro. Castro has criticized Gor-
bachev’s pragmatic reforms, and
Soviet officials have said they
may reduce aid in the future to
the Caribbean nation.

”We are going to discuss Fidel
Castro's performance, just as he
is going to discuss our own per-
formance,” Soviet spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov told ABC-
TV during an interview from
Havana. ”We will exchange
views and experiences.”

Earlier Sunday, Gorbachev
stopped in Ireland and held a
”shamrock and sickle summit”
with Prime Minister Charles
Haughey, who suggested the
next U.S.-Soviet summit be held

in Ireland.

Gorbachev’s two-hour stop to
the politically neutral, staunchly
Roman Catholic Ireland was the
first by a Kremlin leader. It was
Gorbachev’s first overseas visit
since his December trip to the
United States.

NEWS BRIEFS

Overthrow failed by
Haitian government

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
— The government said it foiled
an attempt by rebel army officers
yesterday to overthrow Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril. U.S. officials said
loyal soldiers apparently rescued
Avril as he was being driven
away to be deported.

A government communique
read over state-run television said
”certain officers besieged” the
palace ”and attempted to over-

V throw the government.”

Earlier, sources in Haiti said
military commanders had ousted
the 6-month-old government. It
would have been the third coup
in this Caribbean country in less
than a year.

The communique did not ex-

plain how the plot was sup-
pressed but said ”Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril is in control of the
situation and guarantees peace in
the streets and the security of life
and property.”

It said he would address the na-
tion on television later.

U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Susan Clyde said reports indicat-
ed the coup attempt occurred
about 4 or 5 a.m. and that Avril
was detained for a time.

She said there was apparently
no bloodshed during the ouster
attempt and that the city‘ was
calm.

Cease-fire ends after

WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) —
Territorial police reported killing
more than 40 guerrillas yesterday
in widespread fighting that shat-
tered a cease—fi re and threatened
to derail Namibia's day—o|d tran-
sition to independence from
South Africa.

South Africa accused the rebel
South-West African People's Or-
ganization of launching the at-
tacks, but SWAPO said its
guerrillas were defending them-
selves.

Ambassador's home
struck by shellfire

‘BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) —- Shell-
fire hit Beirut’s airport yesterday,
and radio reports said the home
of the U.S. ambassador was
struck during fierce duels be-
tween Syrian gunners and Chris-
tian army units. Police reported
13 people were killed.

Thunderous explosions rocked
Beirut in what authorities called
the heaviest artillery duel since
renewedfighting in the 14-year-
old civil war erupted March 8.

Syrian and allied Druse gun-
ners poured more than 8,000
rounds, at a rate of up to 100 per
minute, on east Beirut and the
Christian suburbs northeast of the
city in 24 hours, a police spokes-
man said.

Christian soldiers of army com-
mander Gen. Michel Aoun struck
back with 155mm howitzers, fir-
ing at least 3,000 rounds on Syri-
an positions in Moslem west
Bei rut, the central mountains and
east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, the
spokesman said.

The Greeks at Pitt are very
proud of their annual fundraising
drive. "We want to show every-
body that we aren't [just] here for
social gatherings. We do a lot of
other things. In the past three
years, we've raised over
$250,000 for charities in the Pitts-

"Every year Greek Week gets
bigger and bigger. More money

‘with a proclamation from Pitts-

burgh Mayor Sophie Masloff

names were called and were
greeted with applause.

”You just had an opportunity to
see what all of your hard-earned
dollars are going toward,” said
Parise, speaking of the athletes.

Claiborne then addressed the
audience, which was composed
of Greek Week chairpeople and

l didn't like [Special Olympics],”
she said. ’’I was so used to peo-
ple telling me, ‘You can't do that;
you're retarded.’ ” But after a
while she began to believe in her-
self and discovered that she loved
running competitively, she said.

Claiborne has earned the
highest award given in the Spe-
cial Olympics. She now speaks
throughout Pennsylvania as a

Special Olympics representative.
She thanked the Pitt Greeks for
choosing Special Olympics as the
charity to receive the funds raised
through Greek Week.

”You’re changing the minds of ‘** - -

others, especially the public,”
Claiborne said. ’’In my town, all
you hear is bad things about col-
lege students. But it's a shame,

Should doctors help
in patient suicides?

Is a doctor's moral imperative to save lives or to end
suffering?

It's a philosophical question that has been raised many
times throughout history. And it has been raised once
again, not by philosophers, but by doctors.

The New England Journal of Medicine released Thurs-
day, March 30 featured a paper written by a panel of
12 doctors, dealing with issues such as the right to die
and when it is appropriate to ”pull the plug”; that is,
to withhold treatment or life support from the terminally
ill, comatose patients, and those suffering from extreme,
untreatable pain.

But 10 of these doctors were prepared to go just a
bit further. Ten doctors went on the record stating that
physician—assisted patient sificide is ”not immoral,” un-
der special circumstances.

Some of these doctors have gone even further. Several
of the panel members stated that they had, in the past,
provided the means for a patient to commit suicide,
although the doctors themselves had not taken a direct
role, such as administering a lethal dose of a medication.

These doctors are concerned with the pain suffered
by the dying. They came together to state that they felt
it would be better to help a patient end the suffering
than to prolong the patient’s life.

The decision to die is a personal one. Only the vic-
tim of a terminal illness or a crippling accident should
make the personal choice of whether or not to die. The
right or wrong of it aside, if someone is sufficiently de-
termined to end his life, he can usually find the means.
The decision to take one’s own life is a very serious one,
and the action should be carried out by the victim. '

The unacceptability of physician—assisted suicide is
not derived from the effect on the patient — it springs
from the effect on the physician. To assist someone in
suicide is bound to have a very deep—rooted psycho-
logical effect on someone who has devoted his or her
life to medicine, to finding ways to save lives. A strong
guilt and a devaluation of human life are two of the most
obvious and most probable reactions. It would be rare
to find someone with the moral strength to help some-
one die (by direct means such as lethal injection) and
come away from the experience without suffering seri-
ous emotional trauma. Sooner or later, this will affect
the physician's performance, which means that it will
affect his patients’ medical care.

Certainly, physicians are bound by the Hippocratic
Oath to do their utmost to prevent suffering. But the
potential for abuse inherent in physician—assisted sui-
cide is too great; it is too easy to make the mental tran-
sition to the justification of euthanasia. Considering the
effect that the act is likely to have on the doctors who
carry it out, the potential for abuse becomes almost
prophecy of abuse. ~

In a nutshell...

”l’m cleorly troubled by the statement we made".

physician—assisted suicide in The New England Journal o
Medicine. ,

miracle in the hearts of children

All of the organs in my body
were quivering like humming-
birds. I didn't know if it was the
nature of this assignment, or the
cold can of New England clam
chowder that I had eaten for
breakfast which was making me
feel this way. I felt strange.

I pulled into the parking lot of
the Saint Agnes Roman Catholic
Church. I turned the car off and
stared at the building, still puffing
heavily on my cigarette.

BRENDAN
KEVENIDES

When my editor at the
newspaper told me to come here
and investigate some weird hap-
penings, my first reaction was to
laugh. Apparently, duringa Mass
on Palm Sunday, a few small chil-
dren in the congregation had
seen a statue of Jesus Christ,
which hung a few feet over the
altar on a wooden cross, stick out
its tongue. '

Or, as my editor so delicately
put it, ’’The darn thing raspber-
ried the parishioners.”

I locked my car and started to I

walk around to "the front of the
church. It had been a long time
since I'd been in a church. I had
once been Catholic; now I was
agnostic. I think it was too many
years of Christian schooling that
did it. I just got fed up with
religion. ‘

I opened the front door of the
church and started walking down
the main aisle. There was no one
inside the dark building. The only
light came from thin beams of
sunlight which burst through the
stained glass windows in the side
walls of the church.

I was supposed to meet with
church pastor Rev. Al Skinner,
and several parishioners at 2 p.m.
I still had 15 minutes, so I took
a seat in the front pew.

I looked up and saw the cruci-
fix. It stared, down at me. The
clam chowder started to do its
dirty work again. I stared hard in
return; I suppose I was waiting for
something to happen — like the
figure starting to move, ripping
his hands and feet from the nails
which restrained him. Or leaping
down onto the altarand begin-
ning to_tap dance, Sammy Davis

 

Jr.-like.

I laughed, almost out loud. I
heard footsteps behind me. I
turned around.

”Rev. Skinner?” I asked.

”Yes.”

”How are you? I'm Brendan
Kevenides from the newspaper.”

”Ah, welcome, Mr. Kevenides.
The others will be here shortly.
Why don't we go into my
office?”

”Sounds good.”

"Rev. -Skinner genuflected in

. front of the altar and then led me

to his office, located behind the
sanctuary. E
His office was immaculate, not

' at all cluttered. It contained a

desk, two chairs, a large, ornate-
ly carved cherrywood table with
a statue of the Virgin Mary on it,
and a crucifix hung on the wall
behind his desk.

- He motioned for me to sit
down.

”So," he said, ”I trust you are
Catholic.”

I was a bit offended by this
question and wasn't sure how to
respond. . .

”Ah, no. I used to be.”

I felt stupid.

”I see. Well, perhaps after hear-
ing about what happened yester-
day, you'll decide to follow Jesus
Christ again."

I doubt it, I thought to myself.

”Perhaps,” I said.

The others arrived. They were
two couples ‘— one young, one
middle-aged — and, their chil-
dren. These children, I supposed,
were the ones who had seen the

. ”rasberry.”

One of the children spoke up,
”Are you the man who's gonna
interview us?”

“Yes,” I replied in a childlike
voice.

”Mommy, can I tell him what’

I saw?” ‘

”Go ahead, Johnny,” his
mother said. .

The child was 12 years old and
excited to tell his tale to me.

”| just received communion.
and was praying when I heard
this bad sound. I thought Billy
[his brother] farted, and I laughed.
Mommy smacked me and told

" me to shut up. When I looked at

the altar, I saw that it was Jesus

who made the noise. His tongue
,was "sticking out._..." '

 

”Then he said ’Mommy, Mom-
my, look at Jesus,’ ” Johnny's
mother interrupted. ”When I
looked up and saw nothing differ-
ent about the crucifix, I told him

to hush. But then I heard other’

children in the congregation
screaming the same thing. I didn't
know what to think. A real com-
motion was starting to brew."

The clam chowder was starting
to give me a hard time again. I
hate that stuff.

Rev. Skinner broke in, ”I heard 9

the commotion and looked up at

the crucifix. I noticed that Jesus‘

now had laugh lines around his
eyes. They were never there be-
fore, and that cross has been
hanging in this church for as long
as I can remember.”

’’It was neat,” said Susie, the

other couple's child.

That statement would make a
great headline, I thought.

”I’ve been coming to this
church ever since I was a little
boy, and that Jesus never had

~ lines around his eyes. Now he

does. It's a miracle!"
father said.

I turned toward Rev. Skinner.
”Can I get a closer look at that
statue?”

”Of course,” he replied, ’’let
me get a ladder.” '

Rev. Skinner and Susie's father
set up a tall ladder next to the al-

Susie's

, tar and motioned for me. to go up.

Halfway up the ladder, I looked
down at the believers. They were
smiling hugely.

I looked closly at Jesus’ eyes
and kept vowing over and over
never to eat clam chowder again.
I did not see any laugh lines. The
statue appeared no different from
any other I had seen. I laughed to
myself asl climbed down the
ladder. _

”We|l?” Rev. Skinner said.

”It’s a miracle,’_' I said.

”Amen,” everyone responded.

I bid good day to the believers
and told Rev. Skinner that I'd be
sending a photographer around
later in the day. They all thanked
me as I left through a side en-
trance.

When I got outside, I took a
deep breath, fell to my knees and
threw up. It was a sign. ’

A weekend of injuries and emergency room visits

Good Friday, 4 p.m.

"Where are you?"

”I'm at the hospital; Kurt hurt
his leg."

"Right," I said. "When are you
going to pick me up tonight?”

"No, I'm serious,” Bobbi said.
"We're really at the hospital.”

"Why, what happened?” I
yelled into the phone, finally be-
lieving my friend.

"They don't know. He's getting
X-rayed right now. Listen, just
wait there and I'll pick you up.”

Thus, my weekend began...

Bobbi picked me up 15
minutes later, and we drove to
South Side hospital.

”|t's really weird,” she said.
”Right before I left, some guy was

.telling me how he punched a

brick wall because he didn't want
to punch his girlfriend.”

"Nice guy + did he break his
arm?” I asked.

"He’s getting X-rayed, too,"
she said. I

"Great, maybe he and Kurt can
share a room."

The last time I had been to a
hospital was when I broke my
arm two years ago. I remembered

the atmosphere; everyone was
either sick or bleeding. I wasn't
looking fonivard to the emergen-
cy room.

  

JEICA
COVILLE

"Is Kurt all right?"

"Yeah," Bobbi said, laughing.
"I didn't think I'd be spending my
Friday pushing him around in a
wheelchair.”

When we got to the hospital, I
noticed that it seemed the exact
same people were there as the
last time I had been in an emer-
gency room.

One lady looked like she had

slammed her face in a door.
Another person seemed to be
coughing up a big piece of his
lungs, and the guy who punched
a wall informed us that, yes, he
had broken his arm.

Since they had taken Kurt into
one of the rooms, Bobbi and I
decided to meander down to the
gift shop. .

While there, we saw every
tacky Easter present imaginable.
We flipped through.The Weekly
World News, noticing an African
tribe which payed homage to El-
vis Presley by wearing their hair
like his. We also saw the first pic-
tures of a baby who was born
‘with a wooden leg. '

Not able to contain our laugh-
ter any longer, we went back to
the E.R.

After more time spent watching
sick people being rushed into
other rooms, we saw Kurt finally
come out, limping and looking
mad. .

"Hey, Gimpy!" we yelled. He
wasn't amused.

"Sprained leg; lots of rest and

bathe three times daily," he said. . p

It was during this time that

The student resen/e

It is with some concern that I
am writing in response to Lynette
Wellington's article of March 28
and the ensuing editorial’ of
March 29 in‘ The Pitt News.
These articles were in regard to
the Student Government Board
Reserve Fund. I find it necessary
to clarify my statement quoted in
these articles, as well as to point
out the context in which I was
quoted. - .

First, I would like to apologize
for the tone of that statement, but
would immediately like to quali-
fy it. When Miss Wellington, a
long-time associate of mine,
spoke to me, she never once gave
me the impression that she was
writing for The Pitt News. She
merely stated that this was for a
paper for her journalism class.
During the semester, I have been
interviewed by Miss Wellington

.' a number of times for papers per-

taining to herjournalism class. In

 

addition, this comment was
made in passing, not in a formal
interview. I feel that the afore-
mentioned points prove an ex-
treme lack of ethics. I appeal to
The Pitt News to rectify this in the
future if they wish to be consi-
dered, in any way, as a profes-
sional publication.

Now, I do admit that I was not
fully aware of what exactly the
reserve fund is used for. After all,
in my position as SGB president
this year,‘ and board member last
year, my duties have never in-
volved, me directly with this fund.
This is because there have been
no capital expenditures from this
fund during my term in office. I
wish to stress that I obviously
knew of the fund, and that money
had come from it for the neon
sculpture, given by the students
to the university in its bicenten-
nial year. This I was not" ques-
tioned on. With regard to the

weapons will undoubtedly bring

bring about fast action by other

It was a beautiful day.

Pitt's part-time faculty seeks more pay, security

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staff Writer

Many of the University of Pitts-
burgh's more than 600 part-time
faculty members need addition-
al sources of income to compen-
sate for the low wages paid to
them by the university, according
to United Faculty Vice President
James Cunningham.

"Salaries of some faculty [both
part-time and full—time] are so
low, that [larger faculty families]
could be eligible for food

stamps,” said he said.
’’I’m not doing this for the

money,” said Bill Moushy, a part-
time faculty member who is also
employed by the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. ’’I’m doing this more for
the experience of teaching.”

For Moushy, the job at Pitt is

more of a stepping stone in life,
he said, and not his primary
source of income.

The differences between full-

tensive research and are faced
with the ”publish—or—perish syn-
drome.” Part—time members are
not expected to fulfill these duties
because they are not paid to do
them. '‘

Moushy feels that a part-time
professor trying to make a living
on his or her salary at Pitt will
face financial troubles. ”There’s
no way I would even consider
doing that," he said.

”This is a stunning victory for
part-time faculty at Pitt,” said Dr.
Jane Flanders, UF vice president
for part-time faculty. ”At least we
will be able to gain the profes-
sional recognition and treatment
we deserve.”

These efforts at Pitt reflect a
growing organizational trend by

and universities across the

members,” according to Philip
Wion, president of the UF.

’’Equally important, Pitt has to
end the gross inequalities in its sa-
lary system. The impact on
faculty morale is devastating,” he
added.

One significant reason for low
salaries at Pitt is the declining
state share of the annual income.

Pirates’ tough defense
will be big key against
Michigan in final game

The NCAA championship tour-
nament comes to a close tonight.
Most basketball fans wish it
would never end. We have been
treated to some excellent, excit-
ing basketball throughout these
last three weeks.

CHRIS
BOSAK

The Seton Hall Pirates and the
Michigan Wolverines continued
to wreak havoc on countless
basketball polls by advancing to

‘the championship game. Most

people didn't think Seton Hall
had the team to even come close
to the Final Four. The surprise
exit of Michigan head coach Bill
Frieder was enough for most peo-
ple not to pick Michigan past the
first couple rounds.

The Pirates were seeded third
in the West region but turned
their level of play up a notch, and
breezed through the bracket.

In their Final Four matchup
against Duke, the Pirates seemed
like they forgot how to play
basketball in the beginning of the
first half, and fell behind by 18
points. Suddenly, they started
playing like one of the best teams
in NCAA history. They shut down
All—American Danny Ferry in the
second half and won by nearly
20 points.

Michigan, with assistant coach
Steve Fisher running the show,
had a tougher time getting
through their region. They were
involved in some very close
games but had character enough
to come out with victories. All-
American Glen Rice did most of
the work for the Wolverines.

Michigan was involved in
another tight game against Illinois
in their Final Four game. It took
a last—second Sean Higgins
follow—up and Rice's 28 points for
Michigan to advance to the final
game.

One thing is for sure —- there
will be a first—time national cham-
pion. Neither team has ever won
the biggest game of an NCAA
season. Michigan has a little
more experience in big NCAA
tournament games, but throw the
experience factor out the
window.

When these teams meet
tonight, it will be a battle. Both
teams will be thinking about one
thing — winning. They're not go-
ing to be worrying about any in-
tangibles.

Seton Hall is very deep and
doesn't have to rely on one guy
to carry the team. Their inside
game will be the key forthem.

Although they're not extemely
tall, they are very physical around
the basket and have good shot
blockers. Daryll Walker, Ramon
Ramos and Anthony Avent will
keep the Michigan forwards in
check, and all could score in dou-
ble figures.

Andrew Gaze, a 6—foot—7 Aus-
trailian, is one of the best three-
point shooters in the country. He
hits well under pressure and will
shoot the long one in a close
game. Point guard Gerald Greene
will control the tempo and keep
things going Seton Hall's way.

Michigan will rely heavily on
Rice. Rice can do everything —
he's an excellent three-point
shooter and always comes

J through when Michigan needs

him the most. He can take a
game into his own hands and not

Major League baseball ready to
throw first pitch of '89 season

As major league baseball is
about to throw its first pitch of the
1989 season later today, this
seems like a good time to pick the
teams that will go all the way,
and those that will be" flops.
National League East:

There is only one choice here.
The New York Mets are the
cream of the crop. With Dwight
Gooden, Ron Darling, David
Cone, Bob Ojeda and Sid Fernan-
dez, they have the best pitching
rotation in baseball. If the Mets
get a lead in a game, the compe-
tition will have to face Roger
McDowell and Randy Myers in

, late innings.

The Mets’ starting lineup is just
as scary. Opposing pitchers are
faced with the task of getting past
Keith Hernandez, Darryl Straw-
berry, Kevin .McReynolds, Gregg
Jefferies and Howard Johnson.
Each of them has speed, power
and the ability to make ‘some-
thing happen. The rest of the
lineup isn't too shabby, either.

There aren't many people who
think that the St. Louis Cardinals
have the talent to ﬁnish in second
place. The thing to remember is

that the Cardinals have a knack

of following lousy years with
good ones. They only have two
legitimate power hitters in the
lineup with Tom Brunansky and
Pedro Guerrero, but they have
won without any power before.
Vince Coleman is the best base
stealer in the league right now.
‘Willie McGee and Tony Pena still
have enough punch in their bats
to make the ball fly, and Ozzie

VINCE
CAREY

Smith is still the one and only
Wizard.

The most questionable aspect
of the Cardinals is their pitching.
Todd Worell is still one of the
best stoppers in the game, but the
starters can give up a lot of runs.
Joe Magrane (injured for a good
part of 1988) will be heavily re-
lied upon. Before the year is out;
St. Louis will be regretting last
season's trade, which lost them
John Tudor.

The Chicago Cubs, Montreal
Expos and Pittsburgh Pirates all
have enough talent to finish as

high as second. But the St. Louis
factor will make that impossible,
so these three will spend most of
the season battling for third.

Chicago came on strong late
last season and has a very solid
starting lineup. The main
problem is in the Chicago bull-
pen. There is no proven stopper,
and that could spell doom during
tight games. *

Montreal and Pittsburgh are
very similar teams. Look for Mon-
treal as a sleeper all year, with the
Pirates falling off pace. Everybody
on the Pirates team will have to
have career years again to make
any real run at the Mets.

The Philadelphia Phillies may
be the worst team in the Nation-
al League. Sure, they made
changes, but they might have
made themselves worse than last
season.

Moving Juan Samuel to center-
field may be the worstdecision
since the Pirates started Steve
Kemp in left field in 1986. The
Phillies have no starting pitching,
and that will only leave Steve
Bedrosian (one of the best stop-
pers for the last two years) sitting

National League West:

The cool thing to do this sea-
son is to pick the San Diego
Padres to win the West. That is
why it won't happen. The Los An-
geles Dodgers, Houston Astros,
and San Francisco Giants are all
better teams and will be battling
for the top spot.

San Diego is depending too
much on American League refu-
gees Jack Clark and Bruce Hurst
to carry the load. They don't have
the horses to pick up when these

two can't do it.

For the past three years, the
Cincinnati Reds have finished in
second place. This season, they
have to contend with manager
Pete Rose's problems. This is a
team of underachievers. Kal
Daniels has been jerked around
by management and doesn't real-
ly want to play there. Eric Davis
is unhappy, and the pitching is
flimsy. The only problem the
Reds don't have is in the bullpen
with John Franco (39 saves in '88)
leading the way.

The only race that the Reds will

be in this year is with the Atlan-
ta Braves for last place in the di-
vision. The Braves are an
up-and-coming team, but aren't
good enough to compete with
the top of the division just yet.
American League East:

This division is truly up in the
air. The Toronto Blue Jays are as
solid as they come these days.
Their starting rotation of Dave
Stieb, Jimmy Key and Mike Flana-
gan has been around for a long
time, and they are used to the
pressures of a winning season.
Tom Henke coming out of the

 

bullpen is just as good. The
hardest things to do against the
Blue Jays this season may be scor-
ing runs.

lnfielders Fred McGriff and Kel-
ly Gruber proved last season that
they belong in the major leagues.
Jesse Barfield, Lloyd Moseby and
George Bell are also strong
forces. Toronto has the ability to
run away with this division and
the team should get a boost when
they move to their new, domed
stadium in early June.

The Milwaukee Brewers,
Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indi-
ans and Detriot Tigers all have a
chance to challenge for the first-
place spot. The only question re-
maining is how much spring

training injuries will hurt them.

The New York Yankees are in
turmoil again this season. They
have a new manager, Dallas
Green, a new general manager,

Syd Thrift, and the same old own-
er, George Stienbrenner. Each
has a big ego, and no matter what
happens on the field, that could
spell doom for the Yanks.

The loss of Dave Winfield will
hurt more than anyone expects.
Don Mattingly is still one of the
best players in the league today,
but even that might not help.
Their starting pitching is a mix of
age and overpriced youngsters.
Dave Righetti is not what he used
to be in the bullpen. The Yankees
will lose a lot of games in late
innings.

The Baltimore Orioles have
improved over last season, but
not enough to finish any higher
than last.

live up to their promise of two

EYE EXAM NCLUDED 

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

HERSHEY, Pa. —- Two Pitts-
burgh teams, North Catholic and
Brashear, learned a valuable
basketball lesson in the Pennsyl-
vania Interscholastic Athletic As-
sociation finals: if you're going to
talk a good game, you'd better be
prepared to play one.

Maybe that's why boys’ Class
AAAA champion Chester and
girls’ AAA champion Lancaster
Catholic were content to let their
playing do their talking for them.

Chester, unaffected by
Brashear’s pre-game boasting,
rolled to first-quarter leads of
10-2, 18-6 and 24-10 to rout the
Bullets 72-57 Saturday night and
continue eastern Pennsylvania's
domination of PIAA big school
basketball.

fore the game, but we had to_ go

out and prove it,” said Chester
Coach Alonzo Lewis, whose
Clippers have beaten Philadel-
phia's top team, Frankford.

”I think we had more talent
than Brashear  we played three
or four other teams that were bet-
ter than them. I think we out-
classed them. But I'll give them
credit, they came at us. We saw
them before the game and they
said, ’We’re going to beat your
butts.’ ”

Keith Wood, the Clippers’
high-altitude forward, soared
above the Bullets for 24 points,
and Mike Johnson added 18
points as Chester, 30-2, made up
for losses to state champion
Carlisle in the 1987 and 1988
Eastern regional finals.

Johnson said the Clippers, who
edged Penn Wood 89-88 in the
Eastern finals, were surprised
when Brashear tried to intimidate
them.

”We stayed in the same hotel,
and they said to us, ’We’re going

   
 
 

    
       
  

   

 

ITCTCTOTCTO

Hershey not a sweet place for west

to kick your butts,’ ” Johnson
said. ’’I said to myself, ‘Don't you
read the newspapers? Don't you
know we've been ranked No.1
and No.2 in the state all year?
Don't you know we're national-
ly ranked [No.24] by USA To-
day?’ We’d never even heard of
them.”

The Bullets, 20-7, didn't see
much of Chester, either, as
Wood, Johnson and Zane Shaw
constantly soared above them for
alley—oop slam dunks and layups.
The Clippers stretched their lead
to 19 points early in the third
quarter, then put it on cruise con-
trol after that.

Chester's victory. was the sixth
in a row for the Eastern champi-

on since the PIAA went to four -

classes in I984. The Clippers’ ti-
tle was their first since they beat
McKeesport 82-66 in 1983, the fi-
nal year of the three-class format.

North Catholic also talked it up
before the girls’ Class AAA cham-
pionship — but Lancaster Cathol-

ic walked out of the Hersheypark ‘

Arena with the gold trophy.

Pumped up by what they per-
ceived as a cocky North Cathol-
ic team, Lori Richelderfer scored
20 points as Lancaster Catholic
ended the Trojanettes’ state-
record 56-game winning streak
with a 65-49 victory.

Lancaster Catholic, 35-2, ran its ‘

own winning streak to 14 games
and avenged a 59-52 title-game
loss to North Catholic a year ago.
The Trojanettes were ranked
No.9 by USA Today and were
trying for their fifth PIAA title this
decade.

”I guess you're due to play a
bad ball-game after winning 56
in a row,” North Catholic Coach

Tennessee defeats Auburn for women's title

By Chuck Schoffner

AP Sports Write»

TACOMA, Wash. — Olympic
veteran Bridgette Gordon scored
16 of her 27 points in the first
half, and Tennessee shut down
Auburn star Vickie Orr in the sec-
ond half as the Lady Volunteers
won their second national wom-
en's championship in three years
with a 76-60 victory Sunday.

Tennessee rallied from an ear-
ly five-point deficit to defeat its
Southeastern Conference rival for
the second time in three meetings

this season, and they sent the
Lady Tigers home as the second-
place finisher for the second year
in a row.

Gordon, a member of the U.S.
Olympic team that won the gold
medal at the Seoul Olympics,
also helped Tennessee win the
1987 NCAA title. The Lady
Volunteers finished 35-2, their
best record ever.

Auburn, which lost to Loui-
siana Tech 56-54 in last year's
championship game, stayed with
Tennessee for three-fourths of the
game, but eventually succumbed

to the Lady Volunteers’ intense

Gordon did most of her scoring
on baseline jump shots over Au-
burn’s zone defense and got help
from two youngsters — freshman
point guard Dena Head and
sophomore reserve Daedra
Charles.

Head scored 15 of her 19

points in the second half and

Charles added 13 points, includ-
ing five in a 13-2 second half run
that gave Tennessee control of
the game.

Orr, a three-time All-American,
scored 10 points in the first half,
but Tennessee's 6-foot-4 Sheila
Frost blocked two of her shots in
the first 8:50 of the second half
and that seemed to frustrate the
6-3 senior. She finished with 16
points.

Carolyn Jones and Linda God-
by scored 12 points apiece for
Auburn, which finished 32-2,
with both losses to Tennessee.

Tennessee scored six points in
the final 39 seconds of the first
half to take a 35-27 lead, kept Au-
burn at bay in the early stages of
the second half and broke the
game open with its 13-2 run.

Orr’s second basket of the sec-
ond half left- Auburn trailing
50-47 with 9:47 left, but the Lady
Tigers were never that close
again.

Gordon hit three straight base-
line jump shots to stretch the lead
to 56-47 with 6:58 left. After
Patrena Scruggs scored for Au-
burn, Charles converted a three-
point play, Head sank a jump
shot and Charles made two free
throws to cap the run, giving Ten-
nessee a 63-49 lead with 5:25 re-
maining.

The lead never got below 10
points after that as Tennessee
continued to keep up its defen-
sive pressure.

Don Barth said. ”lt’s not hard to
figure out what happened to us,
they just outplayed us. Give them
credit, we didn't play our game,
and it was for a reason: they
made us play that way.

”But there was a lot of pressure
on our kids, pressure they put on
themselves."

Richelderfer said the
Trojanettes, 31-1 , may have con-
tributed to their own defeat when
they taunted the Crusaders in a
hotel parking lot.

”They were on their bus and
they had their thumbs down and
were saying, ‘You're going
down,’ ” Richelderfer said. ”That
gave me so much confidence. I
said, ‘Wait a minute, what are

_they doing?’ I didn't understand
what they were doing to us."

North Catholic didn't seem to
understand what Lancaster
Catholic was doing during the
game, either. The Crusaders
constantly shadowed North

  A year to remember 

That's what next year at Pitt can be, with your help.
Panther Prints, the Pitt yearbook, is looking for people
to help put out next year's yearbook. Can you:

--organize and plan a year-long project?
--create outstanding designs and layout?

Catholic's leading scorer, Molly
Larkin, who managed only seven
points in the first three quarters.

Larkin, averaging 20.4, finished
with 16 points, but many came
after Lancaster Catholic built
solid second-half leads.

”We wanted to keep the ball
away from Larkin, because we
knew she loses patience and gets
angry when she doesn't get the
ball  and she did," Lancaster
Catholic Coach Lamar Kauffman
said.

”We've wanted to play them
all along. It would have been a
disappointement if we had
played anybody else.”

It wasn't a good day for another
previously unbeaten Pittsburgh
parochial team, St. Francis
Academy, 31-1, which lost to

defending champion Mahanoy

Area, 30-2, by 67-50 in the girls’
Class A finals.

Meggan Yedsena, one of only

more than 1,000 points in a sea-

Craig Staub, a 6-3, 245-pound

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 3, T989

 

Picks——

Continued from page 10
years ago. They picked up Julio
Franco in a steal, and shortstop
Scott Fletcheriis one of the best
dark horse players in the majors.
Pete lncaviglia and Ruben Sierra
will provide the power to put
Texas on top.

To bolster their pitching staff,
the Rangers picked up Nolan
Ryan, still going strong at 42.
Charlie Hough dazzles batters
with his knuckleball, and Craig
McMurtry is set to make a come-
back. Their bullpen is young, but
Drew Hall and Rick Raether are
ready to make names for them-

A selves.

The Oakland Athletics are ex-
pected by most to win the divi-
sion again. They have the same
team coming back that ran away
with the division last season. But,
the important thing to remember
is that nobody in the West
repeats. That is the only reason

they will finish in second.

This team's lineup is as good as
they come. Jose Canseco (even
though he is gone for the first
month) will lead the way, with
Mark McGwire close behind.
Walt Wiess was last year's Rookie
of the Year and has only im-
proved. Carny Lansford is solid at
the plate, and the A's pitching is
very good.

The Minnesota Twins won two
years ago and retain nearly the
same team. Kirby Puckett has
emerged as a legitimate triple-
crown threat, and Gary Gaetti
seems to always be on base.

Frank Viola, the best lefthander
in the majors, is untouchable at
times, and Jeff Reardon puts
everybody down in the late in-
nings. They won't win because
everybody else is simply better.

The Kansas City Royals,
California Angels, Seattle
Mariners, and Chicago White

Sox just don't have the players to »

compete in '89. They could fin-
ish in any order, but will still
bring up the rear.

The Blue Jays and the Rangers
will face each other in the Ameri-
can League playoffs. This could
be one of the most exciting
games of the '80s, with the Blue
Jays becoming the first Canadian
team to make the World Series.

That leaves the Mets and any
number of teams in the National
League. playoffs. Look for the
Mets to roll right through and
take the World Series champion-
ship over the Blue Jays.
