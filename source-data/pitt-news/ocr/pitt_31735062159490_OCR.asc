Apparently it’s all over but
the signing.

From all indications Len Cas-
anova of Santa Clara has won the
coast to coast contest for Pitt's
head football coaching job. He
should be offered a contract any
hour now, unless that matter has
already been taken care of.

Although his selection has not
yet been officially announced,
there seem to be no competitors
left to arouse doubt as to the final
choice.

Purdue's Stu Holcomb, a much
talked-about prospect, actually

only had as brief exploratory inter-

view here last week, and Brown's
Rip Engle, another big name, with-
drew from the race Sunday night.

In Comes '1‘

Giving the job to Casanova means
the banishing of Pitt’s historic
single wing offense, which was ab-
sent from the campus only during
the ‘recent and short-lived regimes
of Clark Shaughnessy and Wesley
Fesler.

At Santa Clara (California) the
44 year-old Casanova has employed
the T formation, reportedly with
lots of razzle dazzle. Pitt officials
were partially sold on his tactics
as long ago as last October when
the Panthers journeyed to Chicago
to play Northwestern.

The night before the Panther-_

Wildcat game San Francisco’s pro-
fessional 49ers, coached by Buck
Shaw, whipped the Chicago Hornets
while Athletic Director Tom Hamil-
ton" and Graduate Manager Frank
Carver watched in delight. The two
men returned to the hotel raving.

Methods Alike

Casanova was formerly Shaw's
backfield coach at Santa Clara
when the latter man was head coach
there. Since the two probably share
the same methods, the Pitt officials
accept San Francisco's performance
as a representation, basically, of
how Casanova’s teams operate.

There was speculation last week
over whether the Bronco coa’ch had
blown his chance for the Pitt job

by telling West Coast newsmen of
his secret visit here a week ago
Thursday. Apparently Pitt author-
ities were wont to forgive him be-
cause he has a reputation for being
anything but a blabbermouth.

He is supposed to be just the
opposite. Quiet "and reserved.

Impressive at Orange Bowl

At Miami, Florida, where his team
played in the Orange Bowl classic
Jan. 2, Casanova, in aiconstrained
way, made a favorable impression
with the papers.

There, his ball club sprung a
21-14 upset over favored Kentucky

eer. _

Faces Big Problem _
But in bringing his T formation
tactics to Pitt he faces the problem
of finding a quarterback tdﬂmake‘

stance. a

Local Church Considers
Offering Facilities

Pitt students’ may have a student center sooner than they
plans of the Student Christian Federation are real-

think, if the

ized. ~

An SCF committee meeting this evening will discuss the in-7
auguration of an interim center at the Grace Evangelical Reformed

Church, Bayard and Dithridge
Streets.
The church has unofficially

offered a portion of its facilities
for use as a lounging and meeting
place. However, several problems
would have to be settled before
the proposed Center could be initi-
ated.

For one thing, a good deal of
student work would have to be done
on dressing the place up. At pre-
sent, the facilities do not present
a completely adequate atmosphere
for a student union.

Also, a system of supervision
during various‘ parts of the day
would have to be worked out Pos-
sibly the seven member organiza-

tions of the Student Christian
Federation would do monitor ser-
vice regularly.

The University has unofficially
approved the idea to establish a
center if the Church proves willing.
Official okay must await the com
mittee recommendations. '

The recommendations

MC Rejects

Amendment

One rejection and two ejections
highlighted Men's Council’s last
regular meeting.

A by-law amendment restricting
' ‘double-duty” on legislative bodies
was defeated by a narrow margin.
The amendment, proposed by Jim
Morton, ruled that any man serving
on both Council and Student Con-
gress would be asked to resign
from one or the other within ten
days or be automatically dismissed
from Council.

President Howard Greenberger
reported on the results of letters
sent to delinquent members Jim
Lauble and Phil Sweet, asking them
to explain their future status.Sweet
did not answer the inquiry. Lauble
labelled the procedure unfair since,
even though he was unable to attend
meetings, he professed all along
that he was willing to work on
committees.

Council however, decided to dis-
miss the two men, the general
opinion being that they had already
had a reasonable chance to prove
themselves conscientious members.
Letters informing the men of their
dismissal were sent out.

Internal elections will be held
in the near future to replace the
ejected, members.

 

Over 5300 students crowded into
the Syria Mosque Wednesday to
make it the heaviest registration
day in the University’s history,
according to Dr. J. G. Quick, reg-
istrar. ’

It topped last Fall's record of
4466 students for a comparable
period. 4 .

COURSE CHANGES

Change in course service is
available today in Syria Mosque
for day students from 1:30 to
3:30 p.m. and for AE&S students
from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., according
to J. G. Quick, registrar. Engin-
eering and Mines students should
apply in departmental offices and
complete changes in the Mosque.

Beginning tomorrow, changes

made by day students will be
made through the offices of the
Deans, then to the departmental
offices. the Registrar and the
Treasurer. AE&S and Non-Degree
students should apply for changes
at the office of the director,
2701 C1.

Dr. Quick pointed out that regis-
tration was one day shorter this

semester than last Fall which
caused more students to register
each day.

"The shortened registration

period couldn’t be handled without
pre‘-registration, he said.
Severalstudents told E.A.Batch-

he said.

Mr. Batchelder pointed outithat
the University had taken steps to
insure the student’s comfort. Ar-
rangements were made to seat the
the students in the Mosque rather
than have them stand outside as
they waited in line to register.

“Pitt is the only school that
I know of that supplies this con-

venience,” he said. Q

planning committee will have to be
officially okayed by the trustees of
the Grace Church and by the over-_
all membership of the Federation,
also, the question will come before
the SCF at a banquet scheduled
for Feb. 16. ”

The banquet will be held in the}
First Baptist Church, Bellefield
Avenue and Dithridge Street, at
6 p.m. Dr. Paul Stewart, president
of Waynesburg College, will speak
on"Freedom” at that time. Tickets
are $1.25 and are being sold at
the Student Desk and YMCA to},
both members and non-members of
the SCF. ‘

If the Grace Center is estab-'
lished, students will find the long
months of waiting for the campus
center much more bearable. Man
of the facilities planned for the
campus will probably be in_cluded
in the interim center.

The long-awaited center on
campus will contain meeting rooms,
lounging rooms, recreational facil-l
ities, a tuck shop, and a dance
floor.

Dr. ' Hovey 5
In Accident

Dr. Walter R..Hovey, head of the
deaprtment of fine arts, is in "sat-
isfactory condition” at West Penn
Hospital after suffering a broken
leg when struck by an automobile
on Sunday night. Q

According to fine arts depart-
ment officials all classes con_-
ducted by Dr. Hovey will continue
to meet as usual with other instru ,
tors. Different instructorswill take A
the classes at different periods.

The car, driven by Harold R.
Steinberg, 28, 2120 Murray Avenue,
hit Dr. Hovey as he crossed Fifth
Avenue at Devonshire Street. He
was taken to West Penn with what
hospital attendents termed a “se
ious break” in his right leg.

Early Monday morning Dr. George
Foster operated on Dr. Hovey’_s
leg. He calls the professor’s con-
dition "fine." Attending nurses
have labled Dr. Hovey a "real
good patient.”

Dr. Foster estimates that Dr.
Hovey will remain under his care
in the hospital for“about a month.’;
The actual time will dependon
the healing of the break, a fractur
of both bones in the lower leg. ,1

Steinberg was picked up by Oak-
land police and charged wit

iWise Caution

A stop-gap or interim measure is never a particularly effective
0 one. By virtue of its temporary nature, it is rarely operated under
, a sound,long-range policy. But normally it serves its brief purpose.
Perhaps, the suggestion that the University use the facilities
ofthe Grace Evangelical Reform Church asia "student center"
will answer the recognized need for such a place until the con-
tractors sprout the newicampuspstudent Center from the Forbes
.0 treet lawn.  J ‘
Until a discussion of thisioffer and the recommendations ex-
pected to come from a dinner meeting tonight and a banquet-Th1rs-
day, the University officially has remained non-committal over its
A prospects. Though the offer is generous, it would be inadvisable
~ for the school to endorse it on the spot if any damage might fall on
any phase of the permanent Student Center that has been promised
the student body in school's expansion in the near, we trust,future.
We accept and believe the student body feels that the need for
such a building on campus is ,self-evident. It is certain that the

e The oft-heardbranding of the school as "a factory” can be wiped
 out far more effectively by a Student Center than by the best fresh-
lmen iandpfaculty-student _relations programs ever devised.

All this seems perfectly clear and obvious to us, but appar-
ently not to some ofthose imm ediatelyresponsible for theil 13,000,000
building program. It required considerable pushing on the part of
student activity supporters among this group to convince the others
that the building had to be placed on the '"must” list when the
scope o.f the expansion was being discussed.

 The relatively-small size of the proposed interim center, its.
distance from the Cathedral (several blocks) appear possible
strikes against its success, if used. _Others may exist and be
brought to light at the discussions this week.

I To assure the success of the structure-to-be the university
just’ guard against an unsuccessful preview. They are wise not
toeleap at the opportunity before they look.

Their Proper Place .

Newspaper composition dots the fieldof literature. Tom Paine’s
"Common Sense” and "Crises" pamphlets, Addison and Steele's
"Spectator Papers” play nearly as prominent a part in the study
of literature as William Shakespeare’s masterpieces. V
J Why this observation? We wonder if there can’t be an improve-
lment made in our most convenient location of today’s journalistic
swriting, particularly the newspapers. The University library seems
to need a more adequate and complete collection of the country’s

easily obtainable by those who want to use them.

V— Their setup might be patterned after that of Carnegie’ Library’s
periodical room, where representative newspapers from across the
"nation for complete months can be instantly procurred by the in-
dividual withouteven going to the librarian on duty.’ The ‘Pitt-room
eems large enough for a similar organization. H

, That Carnegie provides this availability to the general public
and the heavy‘use of these facilities indicates they consider it a
gvalpable portion of the library. Certainly the same value exists here.

I-Tarvard Solves shortage

Among the many plans workedbutl
for the alleviation of New York’s’
currant water shortage, the "Harvard:

As conceived by the hospitable
Harvard students, each man would
invite a coed from some nearby col-

Though acknowledgement from

they printed the fkws of the death

as taking place Jan. 

Now, did they mean to predict
the death ofan instructor, placing
the date a year from now;or, if Jan.
 means 1950, did they consider
the news of such little importance

_For instance one of Wednesday’s
bottlenecks was the station where
_ grades were passed out. The grade
slips were in alphabetical order
all right -- five piles of them, each
beginning with “A” and ending
with “Z”. This usually necessi-
tated a search of all five piles
for the harassed clerks and .a wait
for grade-seekers.

Grades Snafu’d

And there was the grade checking

that, which crowded the Student
Desk on the first day bonus appli-

was perhaps the most depressing
line of all, for there was no wide
open space after you finally got
through.

There was only a long queue
which threaded around tables and
soup cauldrons to a narrow pass-
ageway that resembled the cata-
combs of a wine cellar. Several
students came out of it with dirty
hands from feeling among the piled
folding chairs there for a dusty
winebottle. None had any success.

Mixer Dances

Just That

This semester's mixer dances
will focus on mixing more people
more thoroughly than ever before,
according to Dick Shallenberger,
mixer dance chairman.

Six dances sponsored jointly by
Men’s Council, Student Congress,
and WSGA, willbe held this semes-
ter. The two initial dances on
Thursday, Feb. 23 and Thursday,
March 2 will be for the incoming

freshmen exclusively.

The succeeding dances, to be
held March 8, 16, 22 and 30, will
be open to students of all classes.
This policy has been established,
according to Shallenberger, because
of the greatinterest in mixerdances
displayed by the upperclassmen
last semester and the small size of
the incoming freshman class does
not necessitate holding more than
two mixers exclusively for fresh-
men.

Life Just a "Bowl of Lettuce”

By ALICE [HSTASI

Life at Pitt is just a bowlful ofilettuce to "Thumper” and
"Cruncher”, two of the bacteriology laboratory “freshmen”. Of
course that’s only when they’re especially good,because they get
plain rabbit-food pellets usually. Lettuce and carrots are saved
for special treats.

The "freshmen," white rabbits Bin Venselv Siaduaie Si‘-icieiits

are also used to train students for
work in hospitals and research lab-

"Cruncher” being fed, he becomes
very impatient, and fusses until he
receives his food. Some of the rab-

all of "them are very possessive.

stop going up are 1-22. However
ifunny these statements seem to be,
there are countless students who
_» ‘are taking to the stairs in trying
to get to their classes on time.

Not Efficient
A survey just completed on the
_elevators servicing floors up to
‘eighteen slows that when working
\at their best, they are only 31 per
3‘cent efficient coming down, and at
ftheir worse a mere .06 per cent.

   

   
  

p There are just two things that
were operating againstthe thorough-
‘Tness of this survey. One thing that
as to be taken into consideration
[is that when no one presses a
‘button for the elevators to stop,they
“probably won’t stop. And another
"thing that raises the entire odds
is the “fact that the freight elevator
is put into service sometimes dur-

ing the rush hour.

Can't Win

Many times students will get on
-the‘ elevator opposite to the way
hey really want to go, in hopes
that they.can make the return trip
L nd thus get to their original desti-
ation. Many times their hopes are
shattered. The reason: It’s against
the rules. But still they are better
ff by going to the ground floor or
the eighteenth where the elevators
_load. And usually this is the faster
’way during the rush hour.

‘ Suggestions Offered

 _ Many suggestions have been ad-
‘vanced as how to correct this sit-
iuation. They extend from shooting
I all of the elevator operators to
having an inside slide constructed
between the floors. One of the more
;, practical recommendations put forth
'jfor'_better seﬁrice is the installa-
‘tion of escalators from the ground

lieve the elevators of almost half

A Sports Editorial
I   But...‘

From all indications Athletic Director Tom Hamilton and the
Athletic Committee are aboutto select the new head football coach
from outside the ranks of alumni orlocal prospects. _There is noth-
ing unethical about that. But we doubt that the wide search has
produced a better prospect than one who is at this moment em-
ployed by the University.

That man would be Richard Cassiano, assistant to the Dean of
Men. - ~

Although Dick Cassiano did not apply for the coaching job,
he might have been well worth going after.

’£a<* ***

True, Cassiano at 32 has never been a head coach. But in his
present and_past position he has demonstrated a rare talent which
should more than compensate for lack of experience. As an All-
American halfback and as an assistant coach here and at Dart-
mouth, working with both the T and single wing, he displayed
a knowledge and tact to be respected. His present job has in-
cluded the duties of a good-will liason man for the Athletic De-
partment, and in it he has probably won the University as many
friends as anyone with the institution.

In short, he seems to us the ideal man to cement Pitt’s alumni
and build strong teams for a happy future.

It is quite possible that his lack of experience as a head coach
would temporarily prove a drawback. But considering his past suc-
cess in football and l'11S intellectual capacity, such a drawback
should quickly be erased. He is the type of individual whose
future success is assured, be it in the athletic, administrative,
or teaching field.

4: 4: an: ar‘* *
Now we do not presume to be more expert in the selection of a
coach than Tom Hamilton. The Captain is scarcely a neophyte at
this sort of thing. Off his record, we have confidence that his
choice will be a wise one, and we hope the public will give the
new coach -- whoever he may be --a fair opportunity.
But along withalarge segment ofthe student body, faculty, and

alumni, we wish, in retrospect, that Cassiano’s potentialities

would have been given more intent consideration than apparently
was the case.

(Cont. from Page 1)

Sichko was at first known as, be-

a ball. Toward the end of the sea-
son, however, ‘the coaching staff
worked tirelessly with him, and
improvement was . evident.

Bestwick Wild

Bestwick, although adept at dis-
patching the pigskin, has a reputa-
tion for throwing it away under fire.

If Casanova chooses to convert
Sichko or Bestwick into quarter-
backs, experience may or may not
prove to be the element which will
bring success."

A darkhorse for the signal calling
job may be senior Fred Botti, a
scrub who has spent his existence
acting as the opposition’s T field
general in practice sessions. Botti
has the necessary height (6-1), can
throw the ball, and certainly out-
distances the field in T experience.

Then there is Bill Doziski (6-0,
180), who will be a junior. He was
a T quarter at Donora High, but has
seen very little action in college.

The freshman team, although
coached by Ted Schmitt, who won
23 straight with the T as a Phila-

little relief for Casanova’s problem.

slim chance to develop into T
quarterbacks. »

Thus coach-to-be Casanova will
start out with a large headache.

To obtain this headache Casanova .

Love Letter

Shoulders.

Anyone taking upon themself the brass to go snooping into
Captain Tom Hamilton’s love letters would probably find one that
smells of something which can be neither Chanel No. 5 nor White

     
   
   
   
   
  
    
    
      
  
  
   
  
      
    
   
    
    
   
   
    
   
   
    
    
   
  
   

Within 24 hours of Mike Milligan’s
resignation as head football coach,
Captain Tom received a little ditty
from Harrisburg asking him if he
would be so good as to get the hell
out of the athletic director’s chair.
The telegraphed note claimed to
represent an alumni group, the Pitt
Club of Harrisburg.

/ The signatures were those of
iWilliam Keller, Robert Ogilvie, and
Dr. Leon Shedlosky, none of whom
are either president or secretary of
the organization. Not only were the
signatures of the officers missing,
but to this day no election of officers
has been reported to the University
Alumni Office, as per official 1'0U-
tine.

‘And ofcourse, the John Hancocks
of the 50 or so members, whom the
signees claim to exist, were also
in’ absentia

Now personally, if I were a mem-
be‘: and were going to tellsomeone
they don't know their business, I
would not care to do it via a middle
man, particularly without my know-
ing about it.

A nx ie t y?

But nothing seemed to bother
Messrs. Keller,Ogilvie, Shedlosky,
who wasted not a minute dis-
patching the note and, incidentally,
_ showed enough consideration to
send copies to the newspapers.

A week later, however, one dis-
covers in a telephone conversation
with Dr. Shedlosky that he‘is per-
haps experiencing a wee bit of
anxiety over his doings. ,
“Perhaps our telegram was a
little too strong...I hope we did
not create the impression that we
were speaking for the whole Harris-
burg group.”

There is reason to suspect that

 

the good doctor and his cohorts
left iust that very impression. Said
their communique: "You (Captain
Hamilton) can cease looking for
any co-operation from the Harrisburg

Pitt Club.”

New Note

Now, the three Harrisburg boys
have sent a letter to this depart-
ment with the additional signatures
of two men, Elmer E. Hatter and
Charles M. Hughes, who call them-
selves president and secretary-
treasurer. . A

This time their literature con-
tains no demand for Hamilton’s
resignation. It merely reiterates
that they think Mike Milligan got a
raw deal.

One of the curious incidhentals of
the affair is that Dr. Shedlosky is
a brother of Ed Shedlosky, me of
Milligan’s assistant coaches. But
"curious” it will remain, for no
evidencehas appeared to substan-
tiate the possible impression that
Dr. Shedlosky’s support of Milligan
was in any way tied up with Mike's
giving his brother a«job.

Nevertheless, there is certainly
an impression that the Harrisburg
love letter, which Dr. Shedlosky
terms a "spontaneous” expression
of opinion, could be more accurately
described as "thoughtless" and a
lot of other, less flattering things.

/Edi. Note: See sports column com-

In a letter to the Pitt News, five
members of the Harrisburg Pitt Club
have restated their position on the
resignation ofHead Football Coach
Mike Milligan.

On Jan. 28 three members of the
executive committee wireda protest
to Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
with the request that he resign.

The Harrisburg Pitt Club is not
registered as an official alumni
group in the records of the Univer-
sity Alumni Office. Following is
the text of the letter:

“Mike” Milligan and his Staff
have factually demonstrated in the
three years that they have coached
R at Pitt their ability to produce sat-
isfactory results on the Football
Field. These results have been ac-
claimed thruout not only by Pitt
Alumni but by football followers
in general, including the Press.

To accomplish these splendid re-
sults, it was necessary that the
Alumni and friends of Pitt be re-
activated to form the support nec-
essary to attract promising athletes
A to the University. This work was
done primarily thru "Mike” Milligan
and his Staff. Athletes now matric-
ulated at Pitt have again factually

HarrisburgersRestate Stand onMike

demonstrated a job: well done.

The Harrisburg Pitt Club, fully
aware of the above facts, were
stunned when they found out that
the Director of Athletics, Capt.
Tom Hamilton, had offered "Mike”
Milligan only a one year contract.
A telegram was immediately dis-
patched stating their position.

We feel that the facts that we
have stated above are a fair state-
ment. Now let’s take the Director’s
position.

How did he arrive at the conclu-
sion that a Year's Contract was
fair?

Would he have consented to come
to Pitt on a One Year Contract?

We would hate to believe that
personalities would have any part
in a decision of such great concern.

We in Harrisburgfeel that"Mike”
Milligan and his Staff deserve a
much better contract. We could not
accept as fair what we have seen
in the Press that Capt. Hamilton,

while offering “Mike” Milligan only
a One Year Contract, is willing to
give his successora longer contract.

The next production at the
YM&WI-IA Playhouse "The Vinegar
Tree” to be presented March 14-15
at 8:30 p.m. offers a new type of
staging arrangement, "Theatre-in-
the-Round.”

This technique consists of a
stage centered in the auditorium
around which the audience is
seated, with ample aisle space for
the entrances or exits of performers.
This unique type of staging ori-
ginated in the days of the Greek
theatre and has been widely used
in European countries.

The ‘Y’ Playhouse production
staff believes that this satirical
play ‘The Vinegar Tree’ will mark
the beginning of an exciting and
worthwhile experimental theatre.
The staff hopes to introduce dif-
ferent techniques in plays, such
as new scenic effects,unique light-
ing, effective methods in staging,
and also to develop an artistic and

That one block bears the inscription, Anna B. Schabb, 1925.

The long fight

Exciting as the future of "Marlate”
50 appears, this does not mean that
the use of other insecticides will not
continue. Each has its special char-
acteristics, and each has special uses
for which it is outstanding. There
are at least 10,000 kinds of insect
pests, of more or less importance, in
North America, and there can, be no
let-up in the scientiﬁc ﬁght being
waged against them.

edge gained in makingeach one speeds

Offers to Calm.

‘Anxious Heart’

The “handsomest Pitt fellow”
has offered himself to calm one
‘fAnxious Heart's”: flutterings.

In response to an ad by “Anx-
ious Ileart” in the News for an
escort to the Heart IIop’s “Blos-
som Time Dance,” Feb. 17, Ed-
ward A. Thomas, Business 'Ad-
ministration senior, has written
that he is the fellow “who you
are advertising for."

I Thomas wrote that he knows of
“no other Pitt fellow more hand-

some than myself...naturally."
IIe specializes in waltzing “with
a dash of the hucklebuck."

“Nothing but Iron City and Rye
Whiskey" can satisfy his thirst,
he claims.

According to instructions,
Thomas enclosed a photo of him-
self. He pointed out that his nose
is slightly more to the left than
to the right as the result of a
“fistcuff affair.”

' Ilis close friend is also avail-
able if “Anxious Heart” has a
friend.
