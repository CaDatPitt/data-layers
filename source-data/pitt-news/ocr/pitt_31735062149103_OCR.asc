Zoology Professor
R ° A   ‘ti '
reviews Hal Trip

Dr. S. H. Williams, professor of zoology, and
widely. known entomologist, made a trip into the
back-country _of Haiti this summer for the purpose
of collecting butterﬂies for Dr. Andrey Avinoff, di-
rector of Carnegie, museum and ﬁne arts professor,
and Dr. Hugo A-. Kahl, curator of entomology and
advisory professor to the University, and beetles for
himself. .

He was especially interested in collecting the in-
sects of the Montaigne La Selle range of mountains,
hoping to establish contact between the life there
and that of the mainland.

At Port-au-Prince, the capital, Dr. Williams se-
cured a guide through the courtesy of Andre Audant,
government entomologist. He then drove to a small
town called Kenscoﬂ, 4,000 feet up, where the guide
secured «seven porters for him.

Trek to Marne La Selle

From Kenscoff the party proceeded by horseback
to Furcy, 1,800 feet higher, and the last village they
were to see until their return. From here the trail
narrowed until_it was impossible to use a horse, so
the porters were loaded up and the party set out to
walk over the mountains to Morne La Selle, highest
peak in the range, and Dr. Williams’ first objective.

The narrowness of the trails made it diﬂicult to
pitch camp at night and led to the loss of the «party’s
water supply when a porter fell from the path,
breaking the water cask. After this accident the
group had to depend on showers at night for their
water,'as there were no springs or streams.

For »food.Dr. Williams carried rice and beans,
which, with goat meat and cassava bread purchased
from._the natives, made up their staple diet. An occa-
sional a"gouti‘_,__or wild pigeon which Dr. Williams was
able to shootmade a welcome change. No fruit or
scurvy preventative was carried because it was pos-
sible tosecu-re bananas and mangoes from’ natives
part of the way up.

Voodoo Bull Sessions

"The natives, who are all negroes, live on little
farms far away from any towns, and gather together
only for the voodoo ceremony or for “combites,”
which resemble the old American husking bee. The
natives gather at the farm of one of their number.
and help him build a house, or harvest his crop, all
to the rhythm of a drum.

Dr. Williams saw many voodoo ceremonies after
he was able to get on friendly terms with the hungas
and mambus or priests and priestesses. At first he
tried to get into the ceremonies unnoticed, but he
was always detected and asked to leave. Finally he
began to make friends with one of the hungas, giv-
ing him. small presents, and generally being friendly.
His strategy was successful, and he was invited to
the forbidden ceremony.

No Human Sacriﬁces

Dr. Williams believes that most of the stories of
human sacriﬁce in the voodoo ceremony are mere
sensationalism. “‘The rites are weird, but the sacri-
ﬁce is almost always a chicken, or on rare occasions,
a goat," he said.

While at one of these ceremonies he attempted to
secure one of the fetishes hanging from the ceiling,
but only succeeded in pulling the roof in on himself.

After ﬁve days of marching up and down mountain
ranges, Dr. Williams found himself within one day's
march of the top of Morne La Selle, 9,186 feet high.
While walking down a trail the porter behind him
loosened a large rock which rolled down and knocked
Dr. Williams off the path before he could be warned.
The accident left him suffering from twosprained
ankles, a wrenched right leg, an injured back.

Back to Port-au-Prince

The seriousness of his injuries necessitated a re-
turn to Port-au-Prince and a hospital. His porters
rigged up a litter with a hammock and a pole and
carried him out to Furcy, where he was able to pro-
coed by horse to Kenscoif.

At his hotel, a former pupil, Mr. Stanley Brosky,
now a teacher in Clark high school in Carnegie, and
an amateur radio fan, contacted another “ham” in
Haiti who knew Dr. Williams. This man, a nephew
of Haiti’: ﬁrst president, and Mr. Audant took Dr.
Williams to the station, where he talked to Mr.
Brosky, assuring him that his injuries were not seri-
ous and that he intended to return to Marne La
Selle and carry out his original plan of working
across the moimtains to Jacmel, on the opposite
coast. and to follow the coast back to Port-au-Prince.

Later, learning that he would not be able to walk
for at least a month and would have to abandon the
trip, he flew to Miami by Pan American Clipper Ship,
and from Miami tool: a piano to Pittsburgh.

THEPITTNEWS

Pittpourri . . .

“Marshal” pinned in yellow upon the powerful left
lapel of our boy Sammy Rosenberg should serve as
ample warning to all oﬂ’enders—1et it be known that
Sammy was Intercollegiate boxing champ. You know
Sam—he’s the fellow who is continuously trying to
keep Soupy Campbell out of the women's smoking
room. '

Bud Hoffman, originator of the latest campus tune-
ful titter “Cocaine Bill and Morphine Sue” was in-
terviewed Sunday night over local outlet WWSW

where Alex Morgan mellowed through another Hoﬂ’-.

man hit “Summer Romance” which was featured at
the recent CA dance.

The noticeable uppity air of sports patter Lenny
Levison, we learn, is directly attributed to his belief
that the lovely Lea Goldstein has a terriﬁc crush on
him . . . however Jerry Hahn has conﬁdentially men-
tioned that Lea has a far away look in her eye.

Life Goes to Pitt

Stewart Hunter, formerly with the Bulletin Index,
was in charge of the story clicked last Friday by
the Life photographer centered" all around the foot-
ball team . . . the grapevine reports that Joe Kris-
tufek's letter to Life was the reason for that mag’s
sudden interest.

High pressure, up and at ’em, super salesman Will
Sklar was seen nestled in a Cathedral phone booth
depositing $1.30 in good silver and cooing softly “Is
Caroline there ?"'Is it the Villanova transfer, or
dimpled Druid prexy, Joe Roberts? or the whole Phi
Gam house? who at the current writing holds ﬁrst
honors in the exclusive affections of freshwomen
Tony Nesbit (don’t let the nickname fool you; she is
deﬁnitely feminine).

Big Things for Biggie

Scooping the downtown papers it's discovered that
All-American Biggie Goldberg has been writing
poetry in bed. You know, going from bed to verse
(C&G ’37). Six little four-line couplets about the
faded youth of Red Flemming. This Biggie is a tal-
ented boy. .

 . . Talkie Talk . . .

Stanley . . .

This is the Stanley's week to howl——and in a
nostaglic vein, for the man with the laughing clari-
net, the man who chants, “Is everybody happy?
Yes, Sir!” is back in town. The nostalgia is two-
fold, in that Ted Lewis brings with him a show that
gives you a glimpse into the past when the time step
and black face set the tempo for real vaudeville.

Eddie Leonard the minstrel, composer of “Ida”
and “Roley Boly Eyes,” sings, them as we've never
heard them before. And he does a dance routine,
too. Eddie isn’t as spry as he was a couple of dec-
ades ago, but he had the audience applauding long
before he had ﬁnished his routine.

As for Ted Lewis, he puts on a swell show con-
sisting of a smooth harmony job by a girl quintet;
an eccentrically funny dance by Danny White; a
skillful routine by three girls and three boys; and
of course Tediin his own song, “When My Baby
Smiles at Me.” Everybody seemed to miss “The Pea-
nut Vendor” and the barrage of free peanuts, but
this is the best show Ted has brought here yet.

The picture, “Arkansas Traveler,” is the nice
homey type, dealing with a small town widow, Fay
Bainter, who is trying to get her small town paper
out of the small town red.

 

Penn . . .

-Currently showing is “The Sisters." The story,
slightly tainted with the scent of lavender and lace,
opens on election night at Silver Bow, Montana,
1904, when Teddy Roosevelt is winning and prac-
tically assured of a second term in the White House.
Silver Bow is gathered for the election ball and the
three Elliott sisters played by Bette Davis, Anita
Louise and Jane Bryan attend.

It is at the ball that Bette meets Errol Flynn, a
San Francisco sports writer. They elope to ’Frisco
where Errol struggles to make a success and Bette
becomes an eﬂicient secretary of a Babbitt. Flynn
who has become sulky and taken to ruin takes a
freighter for the Orient. As the boat takes to sea,
San Francisco totters with the shock of an earth-
quake. This scene was almost as well done as the
one in “San Francisco."

Warner . . .

The Warner has “Stablemates” as their second
week hold-over. If you're one of those movie-goers
who likes horses and horse racing, especially the
kind where the twenty-to-one shot romps home by ii.
couple of whiskers, you'll get a kick out of “Stable-
mates.”

Story treatment isn’t novel, but good photo-
graphic shots of horse races and stable scenes, and
swell acting by clumsy, lovable Beery and music-
haired adolescent Rooney, make this MGM far above
average.

Fulton . . .

Martha Raye is back, she of the large oral cavity,
with Bob Hope in “Give Me A Sailor.” The ﬂeet is
in and Martha is out to land a mate. It’: pretty
funny stuff.

The other end of a double bill has Johnny How-
ard and Heather Angel heading for another conti-
nent in “Bulldog Drummond in Africa.” Paramount
seems to put these Drummond series out with admir-
able consistency.

 

Plays Show

Comic Trend

Propaganda dramas appear to be
on the wane, with the trend of
playwrights and would-be play-
wrights veering towards comedy,
says Frederick P. Mayer, associate
professor of English.

The social problem dramas which
were turned out by the dozens a
few years ago have slipped into an
unimportant minority, he contin-
ued.

Such popular successes as “Room
Service,” “You _Can’t Take It With
You,” “Three Men on a Horse,”
and “Amphitryon 38" show that
the public is anxious to forget the
disturbing questions of the Lewis
and Rice problem plays.

“As for literary tastes,” Mr.
Mayer said, “there has been a
striking shift from the objective
psychological study to the newly
popular historical novel in America
and England. ‘So Red the Rose,’
‘Gone With the Wind,’ and ‘North-
west Passage’ have remained at
the top of best-selling fiction lists.”

“This trend is a sign of a new
nationalistic spirit, of an enthu-
siasm for the nation's past and for
its heritage, its heroes and its
great battles. It marks the end of
a style that insisted on a monotony
of type and scene; a style that
drew defeated people in everyday
dull or sordid situations.”

This new ﬁction, Mr. Mayer
maintains, will renew the old de-
light in a story of imagination. It
will bring back the plotted adven-
turous romance. But, he insists, if
it gets too far away from the truth
of today, we will again ask for
stories about ourselves.

Mustangs Sway, Pitt

Swings To

34 - 7 Win

According to the music critics,’3

swing music “incites.” Therefore
it must have been the SMU band
tempo that played a major part in
spurring the musically-susceptible
Panthers into double-beat motion
last Saturday afternoon.

That is one reason that has been
presented for the increased scor-
ing speed of the Pitt gridiron jit-
terbugs. There is, however, an-
other school of thought, propound-
ed by the sport swamis, that is
convinced that the fact the Mus-
tangs broke out of the coral and
scored a touchdown early in the
second period was strongly re-
sponsible for the Panther point
spluge. '

Whichever is correct doesn't
really matter very much right
now. This is Tuesday and the week-
end’s swing session ‘should be
notched in its place in the record
book to be recalled at some later
date-—after November. Let it be
further added that the score was
Pitt 34, Southern Methodist 7.

The Panthers have another Ram
session coming up. this week-end.
Then comes "November, and the
Carnegie Tech Tartans. This should
provide more than enough material
upon which to concentrate during
the ensuing two weeks.

For the further sake of the
record books there is some addi-
tional material that should be at-
tached to the reports. First, is the
matter of Goldberg. The “Mad
Marshall,” variously identified as

the galloping Goldberg, established ~

a new record. even for himself Sat-

‘urday. He played a ‘perfect football

game. Dr. Sutherland had not one
noteof criticism for his recently-
converted fullback, which is some-
thing new in the Sutherland notes.

Then there is the matter of a
new passing combination, Chick-
erneo to Daddio. Roomate Chick-
ierneo threw four successful passes

‘to roomate Daddio during the

cou-rse of an afternoon's game.
This brings up another point.
Pitt ‘put on an aerial circus that al-
tered the notes of many a scout in
Saturday’s scouting box. Throw-
ing 9 completed passes in 16 at-
tempts, all for sizeable gains, is as
much as could be asked for from
any forward passing team. Added

'_ to that versatility note is the man-

ner in which the passes were
thrown. Each man in the starting
backﬁeld threw a successful pass.

Pitt scoring was enacted in each
period of play. In the ﬁrst quarter,
Stebbins threw 10 yards‘ to Chick-
erneo, who ran 25 more for a touch-
down. In the second quarter the
Panthers tallied twice. Both were
made the same way by Dick Cas-
siano. He ran around right end for
nine yards two times in the second
period.

In the third quarter Cassiano

V threw one of his soft, high arching

passes into the arms of Fabian
Hoffmann. Final Pitt touchdown
was made by Ben Kish, a buck
through the line.

SMU’s score, which set oﬂ’ the
Pitt ﬁreworks was made in the
middle of the second period on an
endiaround run by Bill Dewell from
the middle of the ﬁeld against the
Pitt's second team.

SM U Swingsters
Steal Show

Back to Texas at 5 o’clock Sun-
day morning went the Southern
Methodist University swing
band, but its melody lingers on.
The campus is still swinging and
swaying from the effects of one
of the “sweetest” bands to ever
truck into the Pitt Stadium.

Not content with the game
performance of the newly-out-
ﬁtted SMU swingsters, the Pitt
cheering section gathered down
on the Stadium gridiron after
the football fectivities to indulge
in an extra “jam session.”

Their swing music, sway style,
and double-qu‘ck step was the
ﬁrst of its kind in the Stadium.

Rumor has it that the Junior
Prom chairman, whoever he may
be. is thinking of importing the
Mustangs for that aﬁair.

'A similarly good impression
was also made by the SMU team.
“The best sports and cleanest
team we've played all year,” said
Dick Cassiano and Marshall
Goldberg in the locker room.

 

Spartans

Harriers

Coach Olson’s travel weary cross-
country team suffered its ﬁrst de-
feat of the season, on Saturday, at
Lansing, Michigan, when it bowed
to Michigan State's powerful ﬁve-
time national champs by a score of
20-35.

The meet was much closer than
the score indicates and so closely
bunched were the runners at the
ﬁnish that Olson ventures the opin-
ion that had his boys been running
on their own familiar course, they
would still remain in the. unbeaten
class.  ‘W’ I ‘,_'._

Wet, cold weather had the upper
hand in the intramural program
last week with the result that ten-
nis and horseshoes tournaments re-
mained at a standstill. But, like
Uncle Sam's mail boys, touch foot-
ball teams refused to take notice
of the wind and rain.

Both the Engineering and Inde-
pendent Leagues continued to move
along steadily. The Metallurgists
continued their drive for the cham-
pionship of the Engineering cir-
cuit while the Floogies rose to
challenge the Newman Club in the
Independent loop.

Since competition among the
Engineers seems chieﬂy a matter
of deciding who will meet the Mets
in the ﬁnals, the Chem Frosh-
Civil Engineer match set_for_4:30
o’clock this afternoon takes on the
aspects of what is usually known
as a “croocial battle”.

The Chem Frosh took their open-
ing game from the Industrial En-
rzineers, 13-7, by scoring a touch-
down in the last 10 seconds on a
pass to Simpson. Captain Al Ack-
enheil’s heave to Bill Smith sent
the Civil Engineers. home with a
6-0 victory over the Chem Seniors.
The Frosh also won by forfeit from
E1ectrical‘A, and the Civil Engi-
neers drew a ﬁrst round bye.

Challenge

CE’s In Engineer Contest

In the Independent League, the
Floogies took over the Thursday
Sixth Hour Orientation team, then
toppled the Ramblers to move into
the third round as the opponents
of a strong Newman Club outﬁt.

Cross country features the intra-
mural schedule for November 16.
A cross country race will be run
over a one and ﬁve-eighths course
in Schenley Park at 5 p. m. Entries
for the meet must be turned in
before 6 o’clock of the evening of
November 4. Competition may be
either by team or by individuals.

A minimum of three men and a
maximum of six is required for
entrance in team competition. All
leagues will participate in the race
and league champions will be de-
termined by their position in rela-
tion to other members of their
league. Thus, a team may ﬁnish
second or tenth and still win their
league championship. Any indivi-
dual entered will be competing for
the open championship.

in the Cathedral of Learning,
schools and departments other
than the undergraduate schools
are involved.‘ Itis "our feeling-
that the place to show our en-
thusiasm and support ofihe team
is at the pep rallies preceding
the games, and onthejfootballf
ﬁeld. duringl ‘me game.

' “The so-called unauthorized"
footba}l holidays which have
taken place in the. past, are not
in keeping with the maturity and
dignity of. the University, for
they represent “a misguided’ ’ en-
thusiasm which is not represen-

‘ tativc (of: the -vast -maior_ity_-of . the

_ student‘ body. We, therefore, ask
the students of the University to
cooperate with us to eliminate
such unauthorized holidays with
their accompanyingenoise and”un-
digniﬁed conduct." ‘ '
