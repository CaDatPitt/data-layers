Solicitation

To Step Up

Chest Drive

The Pitt Chest Committee
will stage an intensiﬁed edu-
cational program by sending
over 6,000 letters to the stu-
dent body, thereby making
everyone acquainted with the
Pitt Chest.

During the Pitt Chest week,
Nov. ll through Nov. 15, one hour
will be set aside for soliciting in
classrooms. Envelopes will be
passed out at this time which will
have printed on them, “I will
give," or “I do not wish to give.”

Those who do not turn in en-
velopes within a few days after
they are distributed will be con-
tacted. ‘

Therefore anyone not wishing
to donate should sign the envel-
ope and turn it in and they will
not be contacted.

Eugene Klein, Chest chair-
man, has urged all students to
check one of these and sign
their names to the envelope
whether they contribute, to the
fund or not. This is being asked
to prevent further complications
and confusion.

If there are enough pledges in
one area or the other, the per-
centage will be changed accord-
ingly to satisfy the students.

Pledges should be fulfilled
soon as possible after the day
soliciting. The envelopes can
turned in at the student desk
the ground of the Cathedral.

The new feature this year_is
at the Allocations can be chang-
ed if the Pitt students desire.

Students are to write on the en-
velope speciﬁcally‘ where they
want‘ their money to go.

the warm endorsement of leading
psychiatrists, including Dr. Jack
Ewalt, Massachusetts Commission-
er of Mental Health, and Dr. Mil-
ton Greenblatt, research director
at the Massachusetts Mental
Health Center. ’
In the words of Dr. Ewalt, “I
would heartily recommend this
program to other states. Student
volunteers could do a lot to
make up for the nationwide
shortage in professional person-
nel, which today is the most
urgent problem facing our men-
tal-health administrators.”
According to Steven M. Spen-
cer, staff writer for the Saturday
Evening Post, the mental health

_ problem is “the nation’s toughest

and costliest health problem.”

He feels that this project is an es-
pecially worthy one in that “small
things—-a word, a gift, a simple
act of friendship-——may exert a
powerful inﬂuence in leading a
mentally sick person along the
road to recovery.”

Spencer also recognizes the
beneﬁts of this project to the
students. He says, “Certainly all
of these students, in their close
and sympathetic contact with
the mentally ill, have acquired
a depth of understanding they
could have gained in no other
way.

“They have come face to face
with the illness which fills half of
the nation’s hospital beds.

“They have encountered this
challenge at that wonderful age
when they are easily charged with
a‘ determination to do something
about it, and with their rich, first-
hand knowledge, they can be de-
pended upon, as citizens, to take
intelligent and effective action.”

Because ongz‘noorz'7g is a profosszon at GM

During your early days at GM, for examplegl
you work with a senior engineer who guides
your career along professional lines.

You are also actively encouraged to pursue
your education towards an advanced degree.
For we at General Motors recognize that, in
doing so, you will become more valuable to

All this is for a reason-—and a good one.

Many of the men who will ﬁll the key posi-

— tions at GM in the future are the young engi-
neers joining GM today. This is not theory,
it is fact. For 1-4 of our 33 Vice-Presidents are
engineers, 23 of our 42 Division General Man-
agers are engineers, too.

such as you-—who may ﬁll these positions G" ,

and financial-are substantial. If you feel you

I . An Open letter

Editor, The Pitt News: . e

In this open letter, the 1957 Homecoming Committee
extends its thanks to each committee member and to all
students, alumni, and friends of Pitt for their interest and
participation _in the Homecoming festivities. _

As co—ord_inator of the program, I should like to thank
each of you personally. Since this is impossible, I take this
opportunity, through the columns of the PITT NEWS to
speak of the special thanks due certain individuals and
groups. ‘

First, allof us are grateful to the Homecoming Queen
and her court. They represented us well in their many ap-
pearances and activities, and their loyalty and devotion to
Pitt was evident in all they did.

Particular thanks should go to the student chairman,

and to his committee, the chairmen of the special events.
All of these‘ students helped make Homecoming a real suc-

-cess by their hard work. .

y The Student Union Board, its director, and the Open
House Committee provided a splendid program after the
Homecoming game. i I ' -

Thanks are due the members of organizations who
spent long and tiring hours in makingthe ﬂoat parade suc-
cessful, and to Alpha Phi Omega for producing one of the

, highlights of the half—time, the Queen’s ﬂoat.

I hope all students will pledge themselves, as-I shall,
to the improvement of the Homecoming program. We can
now look forward in anticipation to next year’s Homecom-
ing. With the spirit and good work of all, we can become
the best publicity representatives of Pitt.

Outsiclers Keep I Cut . . .-

From The News D

By Gordomclowney

A Every so often tidbits of information from here
there and everywhere are accumulated in an edi-
tor’s desk and ﬁnally must be printed or discarded.

It might be appropriate at this time to comment
on Curly, the Russian dog who last week became
the worlds ﬁrst space traveler. One of Russia’s

leading scientists, A. A. Blagon_-
ravov, said in a Moscow Radio
broadcast that the dog in Sput-
nik the second is an experienced
rocket traveler.

He hinted the new satellite

-.contained a device which may

eventually eject the spacesuited
dog and_ parachute it back to
earth. Blagonravov gave the im-
pression there was some arrange-
ment for assuring the dog’s saf-
ety and life.

The usual hue andlcry has been raised from the
American Society for Prevention of Cduelty to An-.
imals. All decent persons are opposed towillful,
sadistic cruelty and torture of animals. However,
sometimes it becomes necessary to use animals in
scientiﬁc experimentation in order to achieve an
end result or product which will be beneﬁcial to

human beings everywhere.

Since itis humans who conduct scientiﬁc ex-
periments, it only stands to reason that where prac-
tical they will use animals instead of other humans
when it becomes necessary to obtain a living test

subject.

Monkeys Used

Members of the ASPCA mightwell reflect on
how many more polio cases would have occurred

 

  esk

 

in our Nation this year had not Dr. Salk used the

polio vaccine.

Let’s hope our friend Curly has a nice trip, and,
like a good paratrooper keeps loose and relaxed
when he hits terra ﬁrma. So much for satellites.  ,

The following items are gathered from college, ~
papers throughout the_country. 7

Syracuse university DAILY ORANGE editors-
made a few comments recently on restrictive
clauses in Greek national charters and the stu-
dents’ responsibilityconcerning them. The follow-
ing are exerpts. “Though much ofthe blame for
restrictive clauses can be placed with alumni and
national officers, the students themselves exert a.

— certain amount of pressure. A
Parental Influence _ -.

types of prejudice by their parents and ﬁrmly be- /

realize that they‘ will meet all types in life, are
anxious to mix with those of other beliefs in true
liberal fashions.” . A ,
“Then, there, are those who. are apathetic to
the whole situation. They imeet those of other races
and creeds in classes and activities and feel that
this is enough mixing. This is a problem that can‘-'
not be solved overnight. Still, it seems. logical to us
that a liberal education cannot be completed until
students have not only met those of oher'back-
grounds, but have seen them in the daily routines.

That Doggie |nThe Sputnik

. By Carolyn Sfasenko
. But? I DO like dogs, I said to
the little woman. I still do not
see ‘what all the fuss is about, I
said. Now let me get some sleep.
You do not, she said George
Smellvin, you  ~ V
are a brute,
you have ab-
solutely no

 
     

 

heart at a l 1.
Imagine send-
ing an inno-

cent little dog
up into outer
s p a c e a n d
everything. It V
is just inhu- '
man, that is _
what it is, she said. ,

Uh, huh, I said. I knew at this
point that the little woman was
not going to let me sleep, my
wife is like that,‘when she gets
mad about somethingshe will
argue long into the night. Any-
how, I said, maybe the dog will
get back alive and then you will
be happy, I guess, but I hope I
do not have to wait until he
does before I can get some sleep.
I said.

That is hardly the point, said,

she, and you know it, and for
your information, do you know
that I read in the paper that he

is doomed, yes, the paper used ‘

that very word, they say he is
doomed. Oh, I said. The little
woman smiled then, she is very
proud of having read the news-

, papers. And dog lovers‘“every-

. gaain,

where, she said, are very in-
dignant, in fact, she said, the
National Canine-Defense League
here is asking dog lovers every-
where to observe a minute of

[silence every single day on be-

half of that poor little thing.

Oh, that is absolute nonsense,
I said, I do not agree with that
at all. One would think it is a
human being up there being
martyred for the cause, I said.
Well, said she, as a matter of
fact, in England they interview-
ed people, you know the way
they do -— what is it called
the man-in-the-street, I
think—and anyway some people
said that a human volunteer
should have been sent instead,
now what do you say to that.

I said that I would say that I
always knew a lo.t of people
were stupid, but I did not think
they were THAT stupid, but I
guess they are if they think it
would have been better to send
a human being up in such an
experiment. After all, I said,
animals are used all the time for
experiments, aren’t they. Doc-
tors, for instance, use ani-
mals like monkeys and ‘rabbits

"and guinea pigs in experiments.

Oh, that is different, she said. I
said, oh no, it is not.

Science learns a lot from ex-
perimenting with animals, I
said, and if this experiment is a
success, then scientists will know
the effects of weightlessness on
a living body and that isivery

important, you know. I said. She _
said, oh, I guess so. It IS, I said

there can be no successful hu-

man space flight until this is

known, and they are also study-

ing the effects of high energy

cosmic rays that exist at that
elevation, and that is just as"
important.

Well if it is, said she, then I
think it is a shame that the Rus-

sians are getting that valuable\.,

information ﬁrst, don’t you
think. Yes dear, I said, you are

~ right there. Now you'will let me

get some sleep, won’t you, I said.
She said, but I still think the
Russians are friends, and really,
George Smellvin, you must be
taking this too lightly, because
do you ‘know that people all over
the_ world are up in protest ~
against it, and if so many people
think it is wrong, then it must
be wrong, don’t you think.

People make mistakes, I said,
and sometimes they can not see
past their own noses. Oh, she
said. Well, there is one thing
about all this that is nice, she

said. What is that, I said. Well. *

she said, with all the commotion
about beating Russia in this
space business, Americans still
have the heart to worry about
a poor littl.e dog, that is nice.‘
don’t you think, dear. Yes, that
is nice, I said, and ‘I rolled over
and closed my eyes. Gpod night,’
dear, I said. She said, good night,
dear. 

 
  

Letters To Tlie.

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is interesting to note that
the potential of the University
of Pittsburgh Rifle Team is seri-
ously impaired by the unsafe,
inadequate and barnyard condi-
tions of the Pitt Stadium Rifle
Range. 1945 was the last year

that we were in a position to"

laud the achievements of our
varsity team. The twelve suc-
ceeding years have been a per-
iod of disappointment and re-
morse. '

Let us discuss specifies, how-
ever, comparing our range to
the standards of the
Pistol Ranges” as recommended
-by the National Rifle Associa-
tion, there is only -one require-
ment that the range meets. The
-distance from the firing line to

“Indoor.

  

the target is ﬁfty (50) feet. A
good description of the range is
as follows; wind blown,- rain
swept, cold, damp and unsafe
facility.

The most glaring condition
seems to be the unsafe aspects
of the rangeusince the range is
open, individuals who might
possibly wander near the range
could very well be injured by
richochet shots. There is always
the chance that the ﬁrers could
be hit, by ricochet rounds. The
manner in which the ﬁring
points partitioned also ‘creates a
hazard to proper observation of
the ﬁring line. .

As is easily seen, the range is
not too conducive to good shoot-
ing and consequently, proper
training and supervision is seri-

Last week was pledge week tor the Tau Chapter of the
national honorary Mechanical Engineering fraternity, Pi

I Tau Sigma.

Since Pi Tauis one of the few honorary fraternities at
Pitt which has a formal pledge period, the pledges are wear-
ing engineers’ caps and gloves with a blue wrench around

their necks. O

The actives have them do such
stunts as counting the number
of steps in Engineering Hall, sing-
ing “Clementine” in the Student
Union, and measuring buildings.

These pledges are either jun-
iors or seniors in the Department
of Mechanical Engineering with
a Q.P.A. of 2.5 or above.

Pi Tau Sigma was founded in
1915, and the Tau Chapter came
to Pitt in 1940. Edward Cven-
gros is the president of this
chapter, and John Vranka is
vice-president. The main pur-
pose of this fraternity is to fos-
ter brotherhood among its mem-
bers wvith various dinners and
smokers throughout the year.

Active members also tutor
freshman engineering students.

“A doctor applies practice to

Ellroyisays as“ a foreriote of his"
*advice ‘to p-re-medical ' students."

subject. - - ’

Well Rounded Pre-Meds

“The pre—med should be well
grounded in modern science but
should also be a rounded person.
His program should include work
in the humanities and social sei-
ences. He must not try to become

"a scientiﬁc specialist at the col-

lege level. , ,

Courses taken should be limited
to basic fundamentals so as" to
leave ample time for the student
to round out as a stable. individual
without false motivations.”

Dr. McEllroy holds this idea
concerning the develo ment of
pre—med students for two main
reasons. First of all he feels that
a. doctor should be prepared to
understand the environment, so-
cial, and economic factors that
bear on a problem. Secondly,
he believes that a broad—base
foundation is necessary for suc-
cess in not only the medical, but
in any ﬁeld. -

Born in Edgewood, Dr. McEll-
roy attended the local high school
and in 1910 entered the College
of the University of Pittsburgh.

This attraction toward physical
activities has never left Dr. Mc-

creation include sailboating, salt

he said.

He spent two years as a stu-

Laboratory

Makes Use
Of Monkeys

By JIM VAUGHAN

Rhesus monkeys, necessary
for the production of anti-
polio vaccine, are being used
in another pioneering research
program.

Thegwork is being conduct-
ed by a unique psychology re-
search group, headed by Dr. Rob-
ert A. Patton, chairman of the
Psychology Department, and par-
ticipated in by graduate psychol-
ogy students.

The group is a division of the
Montefiore Inntitute of Research,
directed by Dr. Yale D. Koskoff,

iClinical Associate Professor of

Neurosurgery in the Department
of Psychiatry of the University
Medical School. Dr. Koskoﬁ is
a. member of the group.

The researchers are studying the
effects of the removal of brain
areas upon body control. Both ap-
proach and technique are being
developed for brain operations on
Cerebral Palsy victims.

In Cerebral Palsy the brain has
been damaged as the result of a
congenital misha or an injury
shortly after birth.

The injured area not only fails
to function properly but inter-
feres with normally functioning
areas of the brain causing crip-
pling effects.

The condition of the crippled
child depends upon the extent and
location of the brain injury.

Almost all the work is being
done at the Montefiore Primate
Research Laboratory. The Primate

Lab is the building‘ on the corner,

of Darragh St. and Terrace Ave,
with the barbed wire fence around
it.

The lab was formerly used by
the group in a similar study.
Monkeys were used then also.

The monkeys are captured in
the annual monkey drives through
the jungles of India and shipped
to the United States.

Those wanting Rhesus mon-
keys must first have a certiﬁ-
cate of need. The U. S. Depart-
ment of Health issues them only
for research purposes where
monkeys are necessary.

Within the confines 01' the mon-
key lab, they are kept two in a
cage and fed an especially pre-
pared diet, part of which is fresh
fruit. vegetables and a vitamin.

The monkeys are acquired at
an early age so that the least
posible number of outside influ-
ences affect them.

Forty are used as a control
group and eighteen for experimen-
tation. After the experimental
monkeys become accustomed to
their new food and environment
they are given special training. for
three months, after which they are
operated on.

A speciﬁc area of the brain is
removed and the post-surgical
behavior of the animal is stud-
ied. After a two year period of

ple are having their member-

row, Nov. 6 and 7.

A table will be located near

the Student Desk for the drive
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on these
two days. The rates are 50 cents
for those under 21, $1 for those
over 21, and $2.50 for national

The NAACPa't Pitt will have

importance. Thurgood Marshall
will be one of these speakers.
They hope to focus attention on
the nature of the situation in the
South today, to contribute to” un-
derstanding of the complex issues
involved, and to seek to help pro-
mote a constructive solution.

Rhesus Research,,

HEMISPHERECTOMY-—-A delicate operation which removes part
of the brain of a rhesus monkey to obtain information about Cere-
bral Palsy operations is being performed above in Monteﬁore Hos-
pital by a team of Pitt psychologists. The team is headed by Dr.
Yale D. Koskoff.

testing and training the brain is
removed and the precise extent
of the operation is measured.
Much has already been learned
from the Primate Study and ap-
plied to humans. Courses of action
in operating on the brain have
been learned.
Surgical techniques that were

developed on monkeys are being
applied to brain surgery., '
As an immediate result of the
information gained from the Pri-
mate Study, operations have been
performed on children crippled
by Cerebral Palsy. They now have
fuller use of their bodies and are
spared much suﬂfering.

“I’m in a business
I nobody dreamed of
three years ago”

“In a company that develops new ideas by
the thousands,” says 30-year-old William K.
Cordier, manager of General Electric’s Man-
Made Diamond pilot plant, “a young man’s
career progress need not be limited by his
particular ﬁeld. In my ﬁve years with Cen-
eral Electric, I’ve gained valuableyexperience
in several diflcrent ﬁelds, and each assign-
ment lias helped me to move ahead. Right
now, I have an exciting job. I run the world's
first diamond-making plant — a business no-

body dreamed of three years ago.”

Diamond Making a Reality

The job Bill Cordier holds is an important
one, created because General Electric has
the scientiﬁc and technical resources needed
to seek out new knowledge and swiftly trans-
late it into products that people want and
need; In 1955, the company announced a
major scientiﬁc breakthrough —- the produc-
tion of real diamonds in the laboratory. To-
day, little more than two years later, General
Electric is making and selling quantities of
these diamonds for civilian and defense use.

I Achieving Three-Way Progress

Ccncral .lﬂlcctric’s ability to take on and
solve big problems —- in research and devel-
opment as well as every phase of production
-— is constantly creating challenging new op-
portunities ior the 29,000 college graduates
at the company. As we see it, by providing a
healthy climate for a young man’s self-devel-
opment in whatever area he may choose,
we encourage not only his own progress, but
that of the company and‘ the nation as well.

McEllroy To .Retire -

(Continued from Page 6)
Dr. lVlcEllroy sees “unlimited pos-
sibilities tor development and
progress in the future.”
University Progress

He does not attempt, however,
to infer that the medical school
has advanced as an isolated
branch. of the University. He feels
that the factors responsible for
the growth of the medical school
are a part of the same factors
which have caused the progress
of the University as a whole.

Many people contend that
there art not enough doctors in
America today, Dr. McEllroy

believes that if, at present, such
a shortage exists it is for sever-
al reasons. Possibly the most
important reason is that “the
,distribution of existing health
personnel is not ideal.” Modern
doctors have a. tendency to
“gang up where the best facili-
ties are found", leaving other
areas deﬁcient. '

Also, the accommodations in
many medical schools have not
been expanded in proportion to
the increases in population. Better
accommodations are necessary for
an increased enrollment, but a
faculty enlargement is required
as a major step in these better ac-
commodations.

Time Needed
And the recruiting of competent

is, as Dr. McEllroy puts it, “the
bottleneck” in the expansion of
medical schools. "It takes time,"
he says. I
Specialization too has to a.
certain extent influenced this
possible shortage of doctors. DI‘.?_
E‘/IcEllro,v makes it clear tliat”
“specialization in medicine is
inevitable wjth growth in med-
ical knowledge." He adds, never-
theless, that “in recent years a
larger percentage of specialists
than needed has arisen."

But he is optimistic about this
phase of the problem. “The pen-
dulum is beginning to swing
back.” he concludes, meaning that
in his opinion the general prac-
tioner will not become extinct.

After July l, 1958 Dr. McEllroy
will remain at Pitt in an advisory
capacity, assisting Chancellor
Litchﬁeld iniﬁmatters relating to
the future development of the
Medical School. V

But he stresses that he will
not act like a nostalgic politic-
ian. “I believe a retired official
has no right to try to inﬂuence
the program of his successors,”
he states.

The years at Pitt have held
much pleasure for Dr. McEl-lroy.
“I have experienced the great
satisfaction of being identiﬁed
with one institution, of watching

it grow, and of working with ﬁne.

Gridders Hope For Win

Hampered By Injuries

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The wary Panther has set a barricade up in front of his.
-disheveled den, It was ﬁrst thought that a return home was
just the prescription for the staggering cat. But his"‘cousins”
from Syracuse ambushed him on Saturday while he was set-
ting up a Homecoming brunch. So with the blockade ready,

Jthe wounded Feline will take no chances with -the fun-totin’
"VI-lillbillies from West Virginia.

Like the triumphant Orange-
men from upstate New York, the
"West Virginians come to the Sta-
dium directly after taking a whip-
pirrg from Penn State. The Syra-
cuse athletes successfully re-.

. bounded against the Blue and

Gold, and it may be something of
a problem to prevent the Moun-
taineers from following suit.

The injury list, like Topsy, is
still growing and the end is still
to be located. Co-captain Charley
Brueckman is now the player with
the dubious distinction of heading
roll of cripples. His right shoulder
is unsound as a result of a slight
separation. Halfback Joe Scisly
was hospitalized with multiple
cqntusions and a sprained ankle.
,Neith.er he nor Brueckman will
enter Saturday’s traditional battle.

Capable Ed Michaels, whom
sportswriters tag “a hard nosed
guard,” ‘also joined Scisly in the
hospital over the weekend with
badly banged ribs. However,
Michaels may be ready to take a
crack at scrimmage by Friday. If
determination means anything, he
probably will.

The results of these injuries
are multiple. Initially it could
mean that the Mountaineers,
with a 5-2 season record, will
be favored to win their ﬁrst
game from the Oaklanders in
four years. Last year’s 14-13‘
squeaker by the‘lo‘ca1s at Mor-
gantown . still 1_-ankles many

- 1 ridge-running Rebels.

Don Crafton, a converted guard,
will likely ﬁll.the center slot as he
did against the Orange. The
Panthers’ chances may ride on his
ability to accustom himself to the
difficult post.

Theodore to Start

Jim Theodore, who was running
second to Scisly because of injur-
ies of -his own, will move back to
the ﬁrst string. Unfortunately, his
physical condition is still ques-
tionable and will be put to the
acid test in practice.

In the event that Theodore‘
can’t go all the 'Way,‘Still an-
other injury list club member
may get the coaching nod. He is
sophomore Andy Sepsi, the
Brownsville speedster, whose
knee at last may be in ‘punish-
able condition.

Because of this unfathomable
injury jinx, the Panthers now
hope to merely keep their heads
above water. The slate of three
wins and four setbacks could con-
ceivably worsen if the substitutes
don’t respond. Coach John
Michelosen, whose contract was
renewed for another three year
bitch, has a difficult task ahead in
preparing the oppressed gridders
for Saturday’s encounter and then
for the ﬁnal ‘pair of games against
Penn State and Miami.

Mountaineer Line Big

The West.‘ Virginia affair will

begin at the usual Stadium time

«not 1:30 before an expected crowd

of 30,000. Coach Art Lewis of the
visitors has had the injury bug
bite his team, also. .However, his
first squad should be in reason-
ably good shape with the excep-
tion of their tackles Paul Shar-
kady and-;’Bill Trozzo.

Speaking of the Hillbilly line,
it will be one of the few this
season to rival the infamous
Five Jumbos in aggregate
poundage. The Five Jumbos did
not start the last game as aunit.
ReservesvKen Montanari and Ed
Michaels found their way into
starting roles. But it was a neat
idea, publicity wise, until a
quartet of football roughies
burst the Jumbo bubble.

In looking, somewhat ruefully,
at the results of the Homecoming
debacle two outstanding breaks
are evident. Line Coach Jack
Wiley cited them following the
battle, under the stands. First, had
Dick Scherer been ablelto corral
Ivan Toncic’s minutely - over-
thrown pass in the last quarter, at
the ﬁve—yard line, the Jungle Cats
would have come out on top.

Secondly, if the daring Chuck
Zimmerman had not completed
his “impossible” pass to End Dick
Lasse to set up the winning ﬁeld
goal, the game would have boiled
down to a tie.

As has been the case in the
three other Panther losses, the op-
position took advantage of the ma-
jority of their breaks and turned
them into scoring plays. That the
Skyscrapermen have not shown
this same adroitness is evidenced
by the won and lost columns.

ever, weigh these and many other factors when
they’rc evaluating career possibilities. Such
factors as opportunity, challenging work, train-

never bother to consider.

The Bell Telephone Companies have abook--

that’ll make a fanatic’s eyes light up, but it -

Gridder Has Problem. 
In Campus Adjustment

. By JANICE KLEIN -
Are football -players different from other people? John

Guzik didn’t think so before

coming to Pitt. But now the]
Eﬁrst string guard has his doubts. “As soon as people ﬁnd out

you are an athlete, all sorts of odd things happen.
“When a guy dons a football helmet he has to contend
with more than the opposing team,” claims Jo'h_n. “People

have built up certain prejudices,
and the legend of the big, unin-
telligent, _and uncouth football
player is almost impossible to
break down.

“Most people think our courses
are only incidental to our football
careers, and our‘grades are gifts

mals, and owns two horses.

Sports Favorite Topic
Before coming to college, John
used to raise beagles. Though his"

busy schedule has forced him to
sell most of them, he has kept a

few to pursue his favorite hobby
—hunting.

Sports of all kinds must be a
favorite topic around the Guzik
home. Both John and his
brother Bob played for Cecil
High. Bob is a member of the
freshman squad, and in spite
of recent injuries he looks like
good material. A

B e s id e s playing for the
Panthers, John helps to coach the
Cecil High line. After the football
season ends he ﬁnds baseball and
basketball to his liking. He is also
a good wrestler, and in his fresh-
man year he won the inter-frater-
nity heavyweight championship.

Likes Italian Food

Classical music is the favorite of
Guzik. But he also enjoys the cur-
rent hits. Perry Como is his fa-
vorite singer.‘ Though the modest
John won’t admit it, he too has
an excellent voice.

John rarely has time to go to
the movies, but when he does,
he enjoys seeing Elizabeth Tay-
lor. When he goes out to eat he
likes Italian food, and raspberry
milkshakes are his favorite
drink!

Although John is a senior, be-
cause of an injury last season, he
has another year of eligibility.
Will_he be back to play for the
Panthers? That is something Pitt
rooters will have to wait till next
season to ﬁnd out.

1957——THE PIT’-1‘ NEWS--Page 31

rs Seeeking Seventh Win

CogaHasFourl;hShutout

By JIM LACEY
Sam Hazou’s third period goal ran the Panther victory‘
streak to six, when they defeated the Brockport Eagle, 1-0 at

Kennard Field last Saturday

morning.

Both teams had many scoring opportunitieslin the first
half only to see them thwarted by alert defensivie moves.
This type of play was typical of the first and second period.

The third stanza began in muchO~——- -

the same manner, except that the
stops by Ron Goga, Panther goalie,
and Rollo Hoﬁmeir, Eagle goalie,
were of the sensational variety.
The defense came-in for its share
of exceptional stops. Jack Hester,
Blue and Gold halfback, cleared
the ball away from Ray Wood-
ward as he raced toward the goal
with no one to beat but Goga.

Fourth Shutout

The Local attack began to move
after a Panther offensive thrust
had been stopped. Hazou inter-
cepted an Eagle pass—out. He ma-
neuvered for a good shot and then
let ﬂy with a low wicked shot
that bulged the net to the left of
Goalie Hoffmeir. This gave the
Blue and Gold 21 1-0 lead and the
game.

This game was the fourth
shut out this season for Goga
and his team-mates. It is the
highest number of shut outs
racked up by a Panther goalie.
Only two goals have eluded the
Blue and Gold star in six
games.

Harold Kipp and Pete Karavel—
]is were injured in last Saturday’s
game. Kipp had an ankle injury
and Karavellis. a cut under the
left eye. Both should be able to
play next week. The rest of the
team is in excellent shape, except
for minor bruises.

Line Plays Good
With Kipp being injured early
in the game Coach Bemis was
forced to move Bill Eisinger to
center halfbaekand put sopho-
more Ron Wyatt in Eisinger’s slot.
Bemis mentioned, “Both played
well for playing strange positions.
This was the most Wyatt had

ever played in any game.”

Three linemen, Chuck Kane,
Simeon Pestich, and Jim Gra-
ham, played their usual steady
game. “These men play a fine

game, one that is not showy,”
comments Coach Bemis.

This Saturday the Booters will
travel to Annapolis to meet the
Midshipmen, "The Panthers will
be looking for the first win" over
Navy. The last two years the Mid-
dies have handled the Blue and

by 5-1 and 4-]. scores.

Both years the Bemismen did
not have enough defense or of-
fense to cope with the fast mov-

Gold easily, winning both games‘

by Ed Fernadel,

Chuck Leith, and Dick Mills held
the Mountaineer attack in check
all afternoon.

The second-quarter splurge
was lead by quarterback John
Sakal who collaborated with
End Steve Jastrzembski on a
47-yard scoring play. Sakal also
scored from the one to cap a 59-
yard drive that was set up by a
recovered fumble. Chuck Rein-
hold tallied the third Panther
touchdown on a 12-yard end
sweep. Fullback Jack Kreider
added the three conversions.

The Panthers came right back
after the intermission to score
once more. This time Halfback
Fred Cox rolled 23—yards through
the center untouched, and Kreid—
er again found the range with his
placement attempt.

Coach Steve Petro emptied the
bench in the fourth period in an
attempt to keep the score down.
However, it wasn’t the Blue and
Gold’s day to be denied as Kreider
plunged over from the one in the
waning moments for the final
marker.

“This is what I have been
waitingfor all season,” voiced
Coach Petro in effect to the
yearlings’ ﬁne showing. The

Last year the Midshipmen had a
10-2 record, good enough to enter
the Atlantic Coast elimination
tournament. They are led by Mike
Woodbury, one of their stars and
Karl Ripplemey a sophomore who
advanced to the Varsity from the
Plebe team.

The Plebes had a good record,
loosing only to the Penn State

Freshman Gridders Explode
For First Victory Off Season

By LARRY HAGGERTY

The Panther freshmen football team rolled to its first
victory in three starts as they defeated the West Virginia
yearlings, 34-0, at Ellsworth Center. It was the first loss of the
seasonfor the boys from Morgantown.

The gridders pushed across three second-quarter touch-
downs to put the game on ice. The stout Panther defense, led
Gene Rosati,(>

drubbing of West Virginia was
unexpected because the Moun-
taineers have had the Panther’s
number the past few seasons.
For the first time in several sea-
sons Petro was able to substitute
in complete units. This is due to
the fact that the Blue and Gold
has recovered from an early attack
of the Asian ﬂu and now appears
to be in top physical condition.
The lads from Skyscraper U. end
their season tomorrow evening
with a game in Akron, Ohio,
against the Kent State frosh. Be-
cause of their showing against
West Virginia, the Panthers will
probably name the score against
the Akronites.

Harriers Defeated
By, Nittany Lions;
Riish Places Fifth

Penn State’s Cross Country
team remained undefeated as they
trounced the Panthers 18-43 at
State College last Saturday. It
was the first loss of the season for
the vastly improved Blue and
Gold.

Ed Morah of the Lions was
the individual winner with a
time of 26:31 over the tricky
five mile course. Ron Rush was
the first Panther harrier to cross
the ﬁnish line. His time of 27:47

was good enough to capture
ﬁfth place. Two Olsen men,
J o h n Christof and George

VValters, tied for sixth in 28:13.

The Penn State frosh made it a
clean sweep for the day as they
downed the Blue and Gold year-
lings 18-42. Mat Crofton took
fourth place to pace the young
Cubs.

This Saturday morning. the
‘track men will complete their
dual meet season with a contest
s c h e d u 1 ed against Kentucky.

Then, on November 18, the Locals
will travel to New York and par-

ticipate in the ICAAAA tourna-
lmcnt to complete the season.

Peery began his coaching at
Skyscraper U. in the 1949-50‘
season. After a slow start of only
seven wins and eight losses, he
has had the spectacular record
of winning 67 dual meets while
losing only seven in his last
seven years.

In the comparable period he has
had ten individuallhlational and
twelve Eastern Champions.

His teams have also won the
E.I.W.A. three times out ‘of the
last four years. Penn State up-
ended the locals 74-61 last year.

Superior Ra.11,ked
High In Swamis
Circles This Week

Fumbling around for about tw,o
seconds, the bewildered and
betwitched Swamis ﬁnally came

- around to selecting Pitt again to

be victorious in their tilt with the
ridgerunning hillbillies of Moun-
taineer Virginia West.

After last week’s misconception,
the eager yogis. are ready_to im'-
‘peache.tt-jlieiferle and Breakstone.
Hefferle picked a 7-1 card to lead
the masterrhinds while Break—go
for bt‘oke—stone hit the bottom of
the pile with a 4-4 slate.

Since coaches can the replaced,
Jack Wiley will take over for the
coaches while Breakstone takes
his second course from Michelosen

on “How to pick a winner."

All the noble Seersagree on
‘Michigan, State and Ohio State
. but are confused as to the power
of Maryland-Minnesota-M i s s i s-
sippi—Georga Tech and the Super-
ior—Bemidji flair. 

‘In the “Game of the Week,”
Superior has received the higher
rating by one ﬁfth of a point over
Bimijdi. The reason for this is
that the Yellow Jacket Quarter-
back Hi Downgrade is using a
cribsheet out on the playing ﬁeld
while Sylvester Wagonwheel of
the Bimidji Beavers has been
flattened out so many times these
past few weeks that he can’t seem
to get rolling anymore.

Wiley though is using a lot of
common horse sense and is pick-
ing Bemidji. After all say’s Wiley,
“Its easier for Wagonwheel to go
Downgrade then cribbing up hill
anytime."
