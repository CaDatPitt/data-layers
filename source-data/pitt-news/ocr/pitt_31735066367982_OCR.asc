Fares Hiked

It's now even more expensive
to ride the bus.

New PAT fares went into
effect yesterday. The cash fare
went from 75 cents to $1 in the
Central Zone, which will be
extended to a radius of seven
miles from the Allegheny Court
House on Grant Street.

Weekly permits will cost $8
with a‘ 10 cent /cash drop, and
monthly permits with cash
drops will be replaced by a
Monthly Pass. That pass will
cost $40 per month with no cash
drop.

Rates Stable

Interest rates charged on fed-
eral loans to parents of college
students are not to be reduced
until next month, the Educa-
tion Department said.

The department had
announced this summer that
the rates on the federal loans
would fall from 14 to 12 per-
cent, effective Oct. 1.

The law authorizing the
loans, which are known as the
Auxiliary Loans to Assist Stu-
dents, calls for interest to drop if
the rate paid on U.S. Treasury
Bills is less than 14 percent fora
year.

But because of paperwork
involved in making the
changes, the drop in the rate
was delayed until next month.

enate Repor

By LAURIE N_lacLEOD

A, fifth faculty committee’
rejected a university proposal to
terminate Pitt’s geography depart-
ment last week.

Faculty ‘of Arts and Sciences dean
Jerome Rosenberg recommended
terminating "the department last
June, citing low enrollment,
departmental overlap, research
quality and .cost as the major
considerations.

The university senate subcom-
mittee criticized the dean’s propos-
al, saying that the proposal is based
on unfounded and inadequate
arguments that neither support a
case for termination nor refute the

 

support of four other faculty
committees.

The senate subcommittee had 30
days to review the termination
proposal, according to a Planning
and Resource Management System
document on the geography
closing.

Now that the senate review is
completed, Provost Rhoten Smith
will make a recommendation to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, who
will make the final decision.

The subcommittee found the
administration's attacks on the
geography department’s lack of
centrality and importance
unjustifiable.

The committee review said geog-
raphy is “clearly necessary” to the

Heinz Grant
A New Response

By RAY WUSLICH

The H._]. Heinz Company Fel-
lowship, which was recently
awarded to Pitt, represents a new
response to Reagan administration
cutbacks in education, according
to Berkart Holzner, director of the
University Center for International
Studies (UCIS). P

The $500,000 endowment,
announced last Thursday night, is
designed to benefit citizens from
developing countries who have
demonstrated outstanding aca-
demic and leadership qualities. It
will enable two fellows to be in
residence at Pitt at one time.

The endowment is the result of a
year and a halfof negotiations with
the H.j. Heinz Company that were
initiated by the chancellor as part
of the general fund-raising process
of the university.

The fellowship program, which
will be administered by the Univer-
sity Center for International Stu-
dies, is the first of its kind at UCIS
and may indicate a trend which
colleges and universities around

the country will be forced to fol-
low_, Holzner said.

“Government funding is inade-
quate for international and area
studies programs,” said Holzner.
“Universities which have these
programs will have to turn increas-
ingly to the private sector for
help." 1

International and area studies
programs receive a total of $20 mil-
lion in government support. This
amount is divided among all the
schools having such programs.
The Reagan administration has
plans to cut this figure back by 60
percent, Holzner explained.

The fellowship program will be
open to promising young citizens
of developing countries in the
regions of Africa, Southeast Asia
and Latin America, in that order of
priority. Holzner said he wants the
program to improve the interna-
tional climate for world commerce.
He said he sees the endowment as
being motivated by a very “enlight-

'ened self—interest.”

“The idea is important because

urban and international aspects
Pitt emphasizes.

The PRMS proposal argues that
there would be financial savings
derived from the termination of the
department, but the committee
review said such savings would not
be significant.

According to the review, if argu-
ments to terminate the geography
department are to be credible, they
must describe explicitly why a re-
vitalized department would not fit
into the university’s plans for the
l980’s.

The decision to terminate a uni-
versity department must take five
criteria into account: centrality,
importance, budget savings, enrol-
lment and quality. According to

graduate geography student Mark
Ozark, the PRMS proposal did not
address these questions.

The review committee, consist-
ing of professor
(chairman), professor Robert
Atchison, professor Richard Black-
ett, professor Henry Block and pro-
fessor Mary Ann Scialabba,
examined the following docu-
ments:

leadership in developing countries
is important. They get locked into
daily living and don't get a chance
to grow,” said Holzner. The Heinz
fellowship program will provide
opportumtes which citizens of
these countries would not ordinar-
ily have, Holzner believes.

The selection of fellows will be
made by the program committee
which is chaired by Paul Masoner
of UCIS. Although the H.]. Heinz
Company will play an advisory
role to the program committee, the
committee and UCIS will main-
tain autonomy over the program's
implementation.

For the nomination and selec-
tion- of candidates, the program
committee will rely on the Univer-
sity Field Staff International, to

- which Pitt, along with 16 other

universities, belongs. It is a net-
work of university staff members

who reside in various countries
around the world. It is best known
at Pitt for its involvement in the
Semester at Sea program.

The program committee will
comb its network of inter-
institutional relations, which
maintains contact with 80 univer-
sities around the world, as well as
notify American embassies in the
regions of interest to the program.

Each candidate selected for the
program, which will last one or
two years, will have a faculty men-
tor to help design a program to
meet his specialized needs.
Although the program is flexible
and will] not necessarily lead to a
degree, it will be rigorous in order
to maintain high standards,
according to Holzner.

While the Heinz Fellows will
spend much of their time at Pitt,
they will also travel to other cities
and universities to further their
learning experiences.

After evaluating this evidence,

“substantial similarity in previous

By MARK STROUP

Pitt’s mainline to the work-
ing world, the University Place-
ment Service, is making many
internal changes to adapt to the
present employment recruiting
situation.

At yesterday's Placement Ser-
vice Advisory Council Meeting
in the Learning Research
Development Center, the direc-
tor of the service, Robert R.
Hopkins, outlined these
changes.

“We have a unique advan-
tage (over many university
organizations). We’ve compu-
terized a lot of our services,”
Hopkins said.

By the addition of computer-
ized services, the placement ser-
vice has been able to extend the
number of individual students’
requests for employment infor-
mation from two to three ‘per
week. Also, when students are
away from school, the service is
able to refer them to potential
employers.

Changes in recruiting pat-
terns are similarly evident.
According to Hopkins, after
witnessing an upturn in the
number of students interview-
ing for employment earlier
than before, companies have

SWOAULDISYOU SAY
NO TO A FRIEND? A

GIVE

begun switching their recruit-
ing to a fall pattern. He said last
fall's recruiting was so good
that companies scheduled every
room available to facilitate the
interviewing of job candidates.

Although recruiting has been
active over the last year. Hop-
kins said there have been slow-
downs iii various fields.

“The real impact is on tech-
nical degrees," he said. “It has
been suggested things: A
ting back to normal.-’~—t A
past, those with technical
degrees were catered to by
recruiters, but today's situation
is more competitive. Still, Hop-
kins says, the job market is most
attractive for professional and
technical graduates.

 

“The liberal arts situation
hasn’t changed dramatically,"
Hopkins said. When he gradu-
ated as a liberal arts major 20
years ago, there were fewer col-
lege graduates and no recession,
but he and those with similar

‘\'.\

 

  

degrees still had to “hustle” to
find a job.

With the renovation of
Schenley Hall, the placement
service is, like many other uni-
versity services, undergoing a
change in environment. When
it moved to the lobby of Schen-
ley Hall, amid the noise ofjack-
hammers, Hopkins had some
reservations.

“We are going to catch total
and unrelenting hell from
recruiters," was his prophecy.
l*ortunately, most recruiters
said that even though the condi-
tions are adverse to interview-
ing. the location was an
improvement over former
quarters.

“We’re not going to have to
apologize much longer," Hop-
kins added. During Thanksgiv-
ing break, the placement service
will move upstairs. lts digs will
include a coordinated inter-
viewing suite with new
furniture.

Hopkins said the placement
service is receiving more
requests from Pitt alumni seek-
ing new employment because of
the economic situation. He said
25 percent of all contacts come
from graduates.

“We cannot provide for them
as well as new entries into the
job market. We have more stu-
dents and more needs. We
wonder if we can take care of
other populations,” he said.

Karrie Budzinski, student
agent for the placement service
for the College of General Stu-
dies, said that because of the
economic situation, “we need
you now more than ever.”

~ Hopkins said he was sympa-
thetic to the demands of rioti-
traditional job candidates.

“Our work is already cut out
for us," he said, but added that
additional staff could help in
finding work for the new job
seekers.

By BARBARA EVANS

Students and staff who are in
the vicinity of Forbes Quadran-
gle, or those who make-it a
point to go there, have some-
thing more than 574 offices,
three lecture halls and several

meeting rooms to look forward

IO.

Ever since November, 1981,
the four-year-old Forbes Quad
has been the home of the Second

Plate, a health-oriented restau- '

rant located at the end of the
west corridor on the second
floor. It is owned and operated
by Alan and Jackie Skirboll,
who have been in the restaurant
business for five years.

It is often the location of
bent-over students who are
seated in white chairs with
green-cushioned seats at round
tables, a book on one side and a
salad platter on the other.
Above the tables are yellow and
white umbrellas that give an
outdoor atmosphere to the area.
Huge green plants are scattered
throughout the area to give an
extra touch of nature.

 Pitt News, Monday’ October 4, l982 I

Restaurant Doing In Forbes Quad?

“It looked interesting and we

had an unusual ideal,” Skirboll
said. “We wanted to specialize

in salads and vegetable soups

only. We finally sat down and

developed a concept.” ,
The Skirbolls have two other

restaurants. Both are called the

Salad Co.—one on Atwood.

Street in Oakland, the other in
the Century III Mall.
The Second Plate is set up

like a snack bar but instead of"

large assortments of potato
chips and candy the counter is
lined with special salads, home-
made soups, fruits, cookies and
a host of other health-oriented
foods. The Second Plate has
recently added meat to its menu.

“The facilities here called for

us to sell meat,” Skirboll said. V

“We have to cater to the imme-
diate public.”

The University named the‘

restaurant the Second Plate

because it is located where‘
second base used to be when the ~
old Forbes Field was there.-
Instead of second base, they"

named it Second Plate because
“plate” connotes food.

foods than I am,” Skirboll said.
“It’s more of a business invest-
ment to me. Oakland is a good
location because of the high
concentration of people and the
people are very health-
oriented.”

Skirboll said business is grad-
ually getting better. “We are
making changes as we go
along,” he said. “We added a
salad bar a couple of weeks ago.
It make the line flow more
quickly. The waiting time has
been reduced between getting in
line and getting your food and
paying for it.”

Since the facilities at the
Quad are so limited, the soups
are cooked over at the Atwood
Street restaurant and carried to
Forbes Quad . Fresh vegetables
and fruit are also carried over.

“We try to be very careful that
we don’t bring over more food
than we can accomodate,” Skir-
boll said. A small room several
feet from the counter serves as a
kitchen that is equipped with a
sink, freezer and an area where
soups can be kept heated.

Practicality and efficiency are
dominant features of the
Second Plate. The small area
was not originally designed for
a restaurant but the Skirbolls
have used some innovative as
well as some old-fashioned
techniques to compensate for
any inadequacies. A small
micro-wave oven is tucked
neatly behind the counter and a
refrigerator and other machin-
ery is readily available to the
employees.

O.V. Solomon,’ the cashier,
has been working at the restau-
rant since it opened in

' November.

“I like the fact that we serve
nutritious food and the work is
not strenuous labor,” Solomon
said. “The customers are real
friendly and honest. A couple of
times I’ve given a quarter too
much or something and they’ve
given me the money back, or
they didn’t have enough money
and promised to bring it back
and they did.”

“The customers do complain
about the prices and the ser-
vice,” he said. “Sometimes they
may have to wait a little because
the place is so small and we can
get real busy.”

One of the most important
aspects of a job is the
employee/employer relation-
ship.

“It’s easy for me to work with
the employees here,” Solomon
said. “The manager makes it
worthwhile because he is not
hot-tempered. He tends to be
more logical and he doesn’t take

his pressures out on the

employees.”

Pamela Brent, a graduate stu-
dent in the University Center
for Social and Urban Restora-
tion, is a frequent customer.

“The consensus of the staff
concerning the Plate is very
positive,” she said. “The staff is
happy this company was
chosen because it’s clean and
doesn’t create all kinds of hide-
ous odors.

“The restaurant is nice,”
Brent said. “It’s not like one of
those fast food restaurants. It's
not disruptive and is very
pleasant.

“I wouldn’t come here at
first, because the prices were too
high but then severzil members
of the staff were talking about
the prices one day and they had
really come down," Brent said.

Change and adaptability are
what keeps a business growing.

“We do a lot of research and
talk to other people in the res-
taurant business to see what the
trends are," Skirboll said.
“Mexican food seems to be pop-
ular right now and we may have
a vegetarian taco available
soon."

The Pitt Ice Hockey Team
was granted club status at
Thursday's Student Govern-.
ment Board meeting.

The hockey team’s status has
been in limbo for several years
because both the SGB and Pitt’s
athletic department would not
fund the team.

Thursday’s action means that

I the board will fund the practice

time, the ice time and the neces-
sary suplies for the team. But
there will be no intercollegiate
competition. If the team wants
to play in intercollegiate games,
the members will have to raise
funds themselves.

Board president Todd DeLu-
ca said the hockey team should
have been funded all along by
SGB. He also said the athletic
department does not see any
possibility of funding the team

Club Gets Status

in the near future.

Board member Robbie The’
said that, as a result of alloca-
tions, the athletic department
“doesn’t have sufficient funds
to fund a hockey team,” and it
does not plan on funding the
team within the next two years.

Hockey team president Renee
Paul said, “It would be a shame
to see it (the hockey team) die.”

I-n other business, the board:

0 Approved a $700 request by
the Heinz Chapel to funda con-
cert featuring Igor Stravinsky.

O Granted the Pitt Outdoors
Club an emergency request of
$1,383 for maintaining the
club.

0 Approved a request by the
Resident Student Association
for its annual haunted house at
Halloween.

appointed Clair Watt as theact—
ing chairman of the Academic
Affairs Committee.

J B21» SEMINAR

By JILL SAVITZ

One of Pitt’s newer traditions
will be continued this year wth
the 12th annual jazz seminar
and concert, scheduled for Nov.
4, 5 and 6.

Seminars on the various
aspects of the music business
and jazz instruments will be
held in the Frick Fine Arts
Building during the three days.
The seminar will close with a
concert in Carnegie Music Hall
at 8 p.m. on Nov. Gfeaturing all
of this year’s guests, including
Grover Washington, ]r., Miros-
lav Vitous, Terumasa Hino,

Monty Alexander, Ted Dunbar, ’

Alex Acuna and Nathan Davis.
Tickets go on sale today at the
Student Union ticket office at

the price of $4 for students and
$8 for the general public. '

According to Nathan Davis,
director of jazz studies at Pitt,
the jazz seminar committee
selects “individual innovators"
to participate in the annual
seminar.

“The peoplewho are invited
are the proven masters. For
instances, Hino is the most
important figure on the japa-
nese jazz scene,” said Davis.

The jazz seminar started at
the same time as Pitt’s jazz pro-
gram. Davis said that the trend
to get jazz programs started in
the U.S. was not taken seriously
at first.

“Any permanent positions
were filled by someone who had
a Ph.D. in musicology, not by
jazz musicians,” he said. “But I

think the people who do it
know how to talk about it best.
The great jazz pioneers can tell
you how they did it.”

The jazz seminar wasn't as
successful in the beginning as it
is now. Davis said only 750 peo-
ple came to the first concert.

“I was very discouraged and
wanted to quit,” he said. “In the
beginning, student government
wasn't really involved, but I was
insistent because it was for the
students.”

Students who missed any of
the past seminars or who are
just interested in hearing them
can listen to tapes from all of
the past years. Those interested
should inquire at the jazz
seminar office in the Office of

Student Activities.

“We've got one hell of a valu-
able collection of educational
material," Davis said.

In 1978, the seminar advisory
board and executive committee
decided to initiate a jazz Hall of
Fame at Pitt. The idea was to
make the university and Pitts-
burgh the world center for jazz
recognition and to establish a
place of recognition for the jazz
greats.

In its first year, jazz critics,
writers, composers, musicians,
journalists and musicologists
from around the world selected
Louis Armstrong, Duke Elling-

ton, Art Tatum, Billie Holliday
and Charlie Parker to be the
first musicians in the Hall of
Fame.

Members are presently
selected by asking members of
the voting committee to nomi-
nate two living and two
deceased musicians. One from
each category is then selected
based on who has received the
most nominations. New
members are inducted at the
annual concert.

It is hoped that the Hall of
Fame will be housed in the
lobby area of the Student Union
when renovations are com-

pleted.

The

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

The day begins differently
for everyone. But for most, it
starts by getting out of bed and
eating the firs_t meal of the day.
Then most people get set to go
to the office or school or call off
sick for either of the two.

There does exist one com-
mon denominator for many of
the faculty and students at the
university——eating lunch at
Burger Chef. Now, it can be
said that the whole university
does not eat at this restaurant.
To a certain extent this is true;
however, it would seem that at
least once in his stay at Pitt,
everyone will inevitably stop
there to eat.

Burger Chef is a fast food res-
taurant located on the ground
floor of the Cathedral of Learn-

/.

 

ing. It is in this restaurant that a
subculture has developed. The
people who go there have devel-
oped a system of communica-
tion and cohabitation that is

‘truly unique.

The main body of this cul-
ture arrives at the precise hour
of noon. Thejpeople at first
come in small droves, then it
begins to explode into a tumul-
tuous_ atmosphere. The lines in
front of the counter begin to
increase from three in a line to
about a maximum of eight or
nine. This is the beginning of
the trek.

This culture is so well organ-
ized it seems that everyone
knows at least one other person
who is in the line with them.
The people talk with each other
and begin to move forward in
line. The main focus of atten-
tion is the person who has just
reached the counter and is wait-

ing for his order to be filled.

Each person in back of the first
one wonders how long it will
take them to get their order
completed. Everyone asks,

“How long will it be?” Soon
the lead person’s order is filled
and the entire process begins
anew.

The orders, as ‘a rule, are
filled fairly quickly since most
of the sandwiches have been
made before the main body
reaches the restaurant. There is
of course a continuing process
of making the various burgers
and other sandwiches, but the
wait in line is greatly reduced

by having the sandwiches
already made and waiting to
go. ’ 1

Once a person has received
his food, the process of finding
a chair begins. This is the most
interesting part of the Burger
Chef culture. People who are
-alone may be forced to eat with
someone they have never met
before. And how do ‘people
react when a stranger sits next

to them—-they simply pretend
that the other person does not
exist. It is amazing what
lengths people will go to in
order to show that another per-
son is not sitting next to them.
People will read a book, maga-
zine or newspaper or just stare
in the opposite direction to
prove that they can eat without
having to recognize that
another person is sitting next to
them. "
There is also a strategy in
finding “that right chair.” If
there are two or more tables
pushed together, the Burger
Chef culture mandates that
people sit diagonally across
from each other. In that way, no
one is sitting directly beside or
across from another. This stra-
tegy can only be used when the
restaurant is moderately
crowded. When it is very
crowded, the culture breaks
down, and people begin to sit
beside and across from each

other. The strain is tremen-
dous, but the culture holds
together.

 

The society that enters
Burger Chef is about as mixed
as anything can possibly be. A
minor poll was taken to deter-
mine what the average person
wears or carries while he is in
the restaurant.

The following results show
what was seen at a typical lunch
at Burger Chef: 1 dragon shirt, 1
alligator shirt, 2 classical
designer dresses, 1 shawl, 6 brief
cases, 2 campus police uni-
forms, 1 polo shirt and 1 pen-
guin shirt. Approximately 70

‘percent of the crowd wears blue

jeans, 10 percent wear corduroy

‘and the rest is divided among

dresses, skirts, and dress pants.
Only 3 business suits were seen

along with 3 pair of shorts.
The sounds that come from
the restaurant are as diversified
as the people who go there. At
ch hour, the

//%%//<.</////

// .4
/’ // 

"noise level seems to be about

99.2 decibels (100 is considered
harmful). In this type of envi-
ronment, it is hard to hear what
the person sitting next to you is
saying. It is all but impossible
to hear what the person across
the aisle is saying. In this way,
gossip is kept to a minimum.

The smell of the restaurant is
also unique. Cigarette smoke,
burgers, french fries, perfume,
hair spray and other things that
are undistinguishable by scent
can all be sniffed.

At ’ 12:45, a small exodus
occurs with a noticeable decline
in the counter line. The decibel
level slowly decreases but is still
high by any standard. Elbows

' on the table are the status quo

as meals are digested and that
last puff on the cigarette is
taken.

At 12:55, three fourths of the
seats are empty and the decibel
count moves down to about 50.

At 1:00, the decibel count is
down to about 35. Conversa-
tions can be picked up from sev-
eral tables away. Rock music is

now heard over the loud

speakers.

1:05: The line at the counter
begins to build. This is the
second part of the lunch hour.
It will not be nearly as large as
the first, but it does create a
small air of excitement. It is at
this point that the workers
begin to take a mini-break from
the rush they just had to work
with.

One man puffs on his
cigarette and relaxes at a trash
disposal. He waits for the custo-
mers to clear out of the back
part of the restaurant so he can
sweep the debris from the floor.
When most of the customers
have left the area, he places a
closed sign on a table, then beg-
ins his task.The people behind
the counter usually spend the
time cleaning the area and
replenishing supplies of nap-
kins and straws. It would seem
that everyone is visible except
the manager. He refuses to
come out because he does not
want to talk to anyone from
The Pitt News——no reason
given, other than he doesn’t
want to talk to anyone about a
story.

Soon the population begins

to decline. There is, however, a

constant flow of people in and
out of the area. The best exam-
ple is at the entrance where the
vending machines are located.
It is here that theprime seats of
the restaurant are located. From
here a person can see and hear
every activity that occurs in
front of the vending machines.

Hidden Culture of Burger Chef

A typical conversation follows.

“Looks like you’re having
troubles.”

“Yeah, what am I doing
wrong?”

“I don’t know.”

“Well, maybe you could put
the money in the machine for
me. Maybe you can find the
secret.” ‘ ‘

“O.K.”

“Good luck”

“Wait. I see what the prob-
lem is. You have to pull this
lever down.”

“What lever?”

“This one.”

“Really?”

“Yeah, see?”

“Hey, you’re right, thanks a
lot.”

“No problem.”

The people who frequent
this area are usually friendly by
nature. This is because there are
only four tables in this area so
distance becomes a factor when
meeting people.

Looking,to the right, a dark
yellow wall reveals graffiti that
has been spattered with coffee
and pencil marks. Most of the
graffiti has been wiped off, but
there are a few that still offer
thoughts on reproduction. The
day begins to slide, and people
begin to leave.

The people who visit Burger
Chef are not particular about
their ways of life. They know
that they will be there the next
day and the day after that. But
in the long run, they are sure of
good conversation, good
friends and good ice cubes to
eat.

Opinion

  Will Anyone
Read It? 

Once in a while, a newspaper takes a moment

. to reflect and ask, “Why do we bother?” The

same question was dealt with in a recent “Shoe”
comic strip. L

The characters decided that a newspaper
should be bright, urbane, a paragon of good
taste and a thoughtful, responsible civic voice.
The problem, as Shoe points out, is how do you
get anyone to read it?

That is what is known as an unanswerable
question. ~

On Saturday, while many of us were either
watching the game or recuperating from the
night before, labor unions held a Solidarity
Rally in Market Square. Only 200 people
showed up. What is even more disappointing is
that only one person at the rally registered to
vote. Rally organizers had expected more
people——the kind of crowd that would march to
the ballot box and alert President Reagan to the
deplorable economic situation.

Rally speakers were irate. One speaker
pointed out that those who came were the ones
who cared, and the rest, for whatever reason,
were just sitting on their hands. He was also
upset that the crowd came nowhere near the
thousands that were expected.

Ms. Judith Heh of the state AFL-CIO had
slightly stronger feelings.

“If we don’t vote, it will mean that we don’t
give a damn,” she told the crowd.

Does the vicious cycle look familiar yet?

Studentsbetween 18 and 25 on the whole,
don’t vote. Those who don’t vote or become
involved at even the lowest level are, as the
speaker put it, “sitting on their hands.”

Shoe’s newspaper would hear the crescendo
of student complaints about budget cuts, high
unemployment and the increasing costs con-
nected to mere existence and ask, “Where were
you last November?” orbetter yet, “Where will
you be this November?” T

If you’re expecting the usual scathing editor-
ial complete with scolding of apathetic students
to materialize, it won’t. In fact, this editorial
won’t chide students for not voting or threaten
them with the consequences of their non— I
action, either.

Such editorials have been written here and
elsewhere in the past with few concrete results.
People still don’t vote. All we can do is continue

. to write the standard voter registration editor-

ial, all the while scratching our heads in the
“Shoe” fashion and asking, “But will anyone
read it?”

The RightWay To Do It

By JIM KANE

Have you been to a rally protest-
ing cuts yet? How about a protest
rally against nuclear proliferation
and nuclear war? If you did make it
to.one of these rallies you probably
walked away with an empty feel-
ing, a sense of not accomplishing a
thing. If you didn't make it to one
of these rallies it’s because of the
way the issues are tackled and the
manner in which the rally was
organized.

There is a small group of dedi-
cated students at Pitt who plan pro-
testsfand rallies against issues that
we, as citizens and students, must
confront. Their efforts are admira-
ble, but mischannelled. ,

Most students really don’t care
about nuclear war and cuts in stu-
dent aid. Those issues are vague,
ambiguous and seemingly
untouchable. For a group to organ-
ize around these issues and be suc-
cessful it cannot attack the issues
themselves; rather it must attack a
figure that is associated with the
issue and in part responsible for the

I problem.

Residents in a low income
neighborhood cannot attack the
problem of vacant, burnt out
buildings. The residents must con-
front the owner of the building or
the head of the city inspection
department with the specific prob-
lem, the specific solution and a

Why
Bother?

Dear Editor:

Muddleheaded column writers are
angry at the state of affairs in the
world. They are so angry in fact

that they establish affairs in the

world. They are so angry in fact
that they establish categories of
people and then ascribe character-
istics to the members of these var-
ious groups that have little relation
to reality. Radicals are this, Moral-
ists (Moralists?) are that, conserva-
tive perhaps something else,
column writers become CIA opera-
tives and pity the poor reader of
The Pitt News who expects coher-

ence in the items he reads.

It may be that Tom Hayden is

_ elected and also that he may be a

source of novel energy in the Cali-
fornia state legislature. But to
deride the motivation, effort and
effects of the student and civil
rights movements is silly and is
about as meaningful as a TV
docudrama.

timetable. In other words, the issue
must be personalized. Neighbor-
hood residents who want to get’
involved will see the owner or
bureaucrat as the source of the

" problem and realize the potential

to win the issue. This is called con-
frontational organizing—the

 ‘ *  ‘ ' ' ‘Sc’Hdo‘l‘dt‘ Law

problem is confronted in a specific,
methodical way.

Now put this style of organizing
into the context of the University of
Pittsburgh and the issues discussed
thus far. Senators john Heinz and
Arlen Specter both wield power in

our government. They must be
confronted here at the university or
at their local offices with facts and
figures concerning the issues that
are available through groups such
as the Arms Race Study Group and
the Progressive Student Network.

Pitt and CMU administrative
officials must also be confronted.
Nuclear research for the Defense
Department has been or is going on
at both universities. Our local con-
gressmen are also guilty of feeding
the university/military/industrial
complex.

In essence, university adminis-
trators and local politicians are the
“landlords and city administra-
tors” of our issue. They must be the
“enemy” that we can focus our
attention on, not the untouchables
such as Reagan, Weinberger and
the abstract issue itself.

Once students can see that there
is someone who can be held
responsible, in part, for aid cuts
and massive nuclear buildup, they
may realize the potential, for effec-
ting change.

Until that time comes, nuclear
war is only what students read
about in newspapers now and then
and student aid cuts are for high
school students to worry about.

Conservative Blues

By MARK STROUP-

Iran into an old friend the other
day and after I helped him pull the
rest of his hair off the fender, we
began to talk, as I suppose old
friends do. My friend is a conserva-
tive, which seems strange._but, in
their own right, they can be likable
fellows. To give you an idea of his
conservatism, he voted for Gold-
water in ’64 and ’68. What makes
him even more suspect, is that he’s
not old enough to have voted for
Goldwater. I thought he would be
pleased with the governments pres-
ent turn to the right...Well, l’ve
been mistaken before.

“If you’ll remember, Reagan led
the Democrats for‘ Goldwater
movement,” he said to me. Yes, I
replied, thinking this should
create in .him a fondness for
Reagan. ‘

“Well, I've always believed that
if you're not a Republican by birth,
why try to buck it? Livea good life.
Do your best. Then in the next life
you can become a Republican."

“Sort of like the ,Hindus," I
replied. .

I could tell this angered him.

* Wri-tare‘ * ybtr ‘gs: fbrmgingj ‘the’

minorities into this."

“What about the ‘born again’
Christians with conservative view-
points?” I asked. .

“My opinion of religion has
always been this: You get it. You
get it once. You get it right. All this
revelation stuff just gets people
excited.”

“Well, what about the military
buildup?”

“I’ve always said, if the govern-
ment were a business, I’d sell my
shares right away.” He always had
said that.

“Say I'm in business and invest
30 percent of my earnings into
something I’m not using and never
want to use. It’d be like Exxon
investing 30 percent of their profit
into batteries for electric cars. And
just like bombs, batteries leakand
explode and screw up. It's all very
messy.” «

I tried to appease him by talking
about the Falklands . situation,
where an allyof the ‘United States
regained territory through the use
of force.

“Now there was a snafu,"_ he
said. “Two friendly countries

Pitt Overdoes It on Dorm. Security

We resident -students at Pitt are
being subjected to a pilot program
of automated access to the dorms.
This means that to enter a Quad
dorm you must present your identi-
‘fication twice—first to the desk
attendant, then to the black box.
The purpose of the system is to
increase security.

Any system in its pilot stage will
lead to inconvenience. Among the
problems with this system are:

0 The congestion it causes at the
desk when more than one person
wants to enter;

0 The added wear on the indispen-

“Take the islands for whom?”

point, so I went on to the affairs in
Lebanon, hoping the events there
would cheer him. up. Israel has
always been a close ally, an ideo-
logical partner and a pet project of
the military establishment; Israeli
troops recently forced the P.L.O.,
which has ties to the Soviet Union,
out of Beirut. My friend got very
hot over the subject.

“The situation goes beyond par-
tisan politics. Bombs are terribly
non-productive. In economic
terms, the loss of real estate was
tragedy enough. And do you real-
ize Lebanese moms arejust like our
moms. I just don’t like the idea of
mothers crying.”

We had to stop talking for a
while, as he became incoherent
and began sobbing. Later, he
showed me his tatoo. It was a pretty
good likeness of the old girl. We
then went back to the subject—at-
hand.

“You see,” he continued, “in
terms of impact on world trade, the
situation in Lebanon was a disas-
ter. We would have been much bet-
ter off if all the parties involved
were working at low-paying, fac-
tory jobs instead of fighting.”

I was down, but not beaten. It
was then I decided to use my ace-
in-the-hole—Secretary of the Inte-
rior James Watt. His placement
was a conservative coup in the face
of namby-pamby nature boys.

“Watt! He looks like a weasel——a
bald-headed, four-eyed weasel. A
man who looks like he does
shouldn't be a Republican. Now a
guy like John Heinz is a Republi-
can, good vision, lots of hair, no
pimples—like John Kennedy."

“But Kennedy was a Democrat.”

“That’s a shame. He had the best
suits, too—Two-buttoned sack
suits, silk rep ties——that should
make you a Republican!”

“Never mind that. What about
Watt’s policies,” I demanded,
thinking I could get some straight
talk.

“I have no qualms about our
historic landmarks going condo.
However, I don’t like the idea of
our national forests being plun-
dered. Think of all the illegal
immigrants we'll have to hire to
plunder them."

I was becoming annoyed by
some of his responses, so I thought
I wouldreverse my technique. “I
sup.pose you were glad that Alex-

.ander-'fHaig resigned." He vexed

me -‘even more by saying that
I-'Iaig'--s resigning was “very unhap-
pying," and “considered its benefi-
ciality under high disregard."

My friend then took off, leaving

..my ear ringing. I've wanted to meet

with him since then, but he knows
what my car looks like now and is
more cautious when crossing the

This system is intended to be
installed eventually in all the
dorms, and it might be a fair trade:
inconvenience for security. But
does this system increase security?
When we punch our cards into the
black box, the only thing that is
certain is that our card has the right
to enter the building. The desk
attendant still must match the card
with the person using it. Do they
always do this? An orange light
flashes and gives the attendant the
immediate impression, especially
at busy times of the day, that the
card carrier lives in the dorm.
This kind of simple human error
is possible with or without the
black box. We think it is made even
more likely by it. And since it
encourages the attendant to forget
about picture and sticker identifi-
cation, doesn’t the system actually
make the successful use of a lost or
stolen ID all the more likely?
The computer system in the
cafeterias is the only efficient way

RENOVATION .
FOR THE INCONVENIEN CE.

to keep track of the number of
meals that each person eats per
week. Last weekend, a friend and I
found out something curious
about the black boxes in the Quad
dorms. While I was signing her in,
we decided to see what the box
would do if she were to put her
Lothrop ID into the box at my
dorm. The box simply flashed.
“Denied.” But the desk attendant
said that my friend had just gone
down on record as trying to enter
illegally. She says she knows this
because her supervisor can tell by
reading a printout whether or not
she‘ is enforcing the use of the
system.

Why are the boxes recording out
entries and attempts at entries?
Who wants to know this? The
attendant also said that the system
may eventually require ID upon
exiting the building as well. In that
case the black box would have us
on record, coming and going. Our
movement into and out of our
homes is a private concern, and
records of it are unnecessary and
offensive. We are not under house

arrest.

We understand that the motiva-
tions for installing the black boxes
were that security for the housing
stickers was lax and that some were
stolen last year and used to gain
free housing in friends’ rooms. In
view of the inconvenience of the
system and the lack of privacy it
causes, one might think that tight-
er security for the distribution of
stickers and color-coding for easier
identification would be a far better
solution.

This is a pilot program. Action
by us now could prevent its per-
manent installation in our dorms.
Petitions, complaints or praise
should be directed to:

Mr. Donovan Hughes
Director of Housing
and Food Services

Several years ago, the students of
Pitt decided upon a security proce-
dure for the dorms. The boxes do
not enhance this procedure and
may infringe on our privacy. In
two years, this system could be

_,,.Missed Kick Saves


Ms

Game For

By BRIAN BALK

Pitt coach Foge Fazio stated in a
post game interview that he was
raised not to give up. So were the
Panthers—they stretched their
winning streak to four with a
come—from-behind 16-13 victory
over the West Virginia Mountai-
neers last Saturday before a sellout
crowd of 57,250.

It took over three quarters for the
Panther offensive unit to kick into
gear, but when it did, they
assembled two drives that carried
the Panthers to victory.

The Panthers’ hopes for a
national title never looked dimmer
than early in the fourth quarter

' after West Virginia linebacker Dar-

ryl Talley blocked a Greg Ganzer
punt and iced his play by recover-
ing the ball in the end zone, giving
the Mountaineers a 13-0 lead. But
the Panthers gave new meaning to
the old cliche “the game is notover
until the final gun is sounded.”

“Like a boxer, you stay in there
until the final bell rings and you
might get a lucky knockout punch
at the last second of the fifteenth
round,” Fazio said. The Panthers’
fifteenth round blow was truly
devastating.

This backyard contest was more
than just a clash between neighbor-
ing schools. The Panthers were not
about to give up their pride, even
when it appeared that one of the
year’s biggest upsets in college
football was in store.

It was the blocked punt that
ignited the Panthers’ emotions.

“After that blocked punt, Phil
Puzzuoli came up to me, and we
looked each other in the eye and
said, ‘We are not going to lose’-

and that was it,” explained free

safety Tom Flynn. Fazio added, “I
never saw (Bill) Fralic as fired up as
he was after that punt.”

The Panthers’ first touchdown

drive started on their own 17-yard

line. After a succession of direct

Panthers

drills and hammering runs, the
Panthers moved the ball deep into
Mountaineer territory. On a third
down and seven situation, quarter-
back Dan Marino spotted flanker
Dwight Collins on the West Virgi-
nia three. Although the ball was
swatted ‘out of Collins’ hands, pass
interference was called, giving Pitt
a first down. 1 ,
Then, with a sweep right run by
tailback Bryan Thomas and full-
back Bill Beach’s crucial block, the
Panthers’ scoredfor the first time.

Pitt failed to keep its momentum
on its next series and had to punt
the ball away. The Panther defen-
sive four, pressing Mountaineer
quarterback Jeff Hostetler to the
utmost limits, forced a fumble on
the exchange. Pitt's strong safety
Dan Short emerged from the bot-
tom of the pile clenching the ball.

The Panthers then drove the ball
to West Virginia’s 22-yard line. It
was third and five, and the ques-
tion arose. Play it safe on the
ground or risk it in the air? Marino
chose the air, but it proved to be no
great danger because John Brown
was there to grab the ball on the
eight. Marino then connected with
Julius Dawkins on a slant pattern
in the end zone with 3:23
remaining. 3

It was up to place kicker Eric
'Scubert to determine the game.
The kick sailed between the
uprights, and the Panthers jumped
ahead for the first time 14-l3.

Pitt did not stop there. With 59
seconds left, Hostetler was pinned
back deep into his territory. As he
dropped back to pass, right tackle
Bill Maas thrust through the West
Virginia offensive line and

slammed Hostetler behind the goal '

line for a two point safety.
The Mountaineers were not will-
ing to play dead just yet, especially
to a team that they had outplayed
for three quarters. After Paul
Woodside’s successful onside kick,
West Virginia quickly drove the

Pitt Rises From Coffin

To Defeat West Virginia

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The coffin was nailed tightly,
sinking deep under the Pitt Sta-
dium turf, when‘the Panthers once
again rose from the dead and kept
alive their chances of a national
championship.

The casket fell below ground
level early in the fourth quarter,
when West Virginia linebacker
Darryl Talley shot through the Pitt
defense, blocked a Greg Ganzer
punt and recovered it in the end-

It appeared as if this Mountaineer touchdown, resulting from a blocked punt, had

nailed shut the Panther coffin.

zone, putting the Mountaineers
ahead 13-0.

Talley stood like a statue, hold-
ing the ball straight up while his
teammates raced to his side. In the
background, the markings on the
stadium wall indicated the years in
which Pitt had previously won
national championships.

The scene suggested that the year
1982 had little chance of being
added to the list. Glory was lying
beside the Panthers in the wooden
box.

Suddenly, on their very next pos-
session, as if assisted by shoulder-
padded ghosts of years past, the
Panthers drove 83 yards on nine
plays, making the score 13-7.

Pitt came back to life before the
eyes of the many Pitt Stadium
mourners, the offense again awak-
ening from a deep sleep. Pitt, who
in four games this season has yet to
dent the scoreboard first, kept open
their plot by soaring over the
Mountaineers 16-13.

“Quitting never entered my
mind,” said Pitt coach Foge Fazio
after the game. “I never doubted
that we would come back. We come
together when we have to.” '

It was Fazio who paced the side-
lines like a father-to-be throughout
the second half.

“Our players got upset after that
blocked punt,” he said. “I’ve never
seen Bill Fralic so mad. Dan
Marino bit his lip and gave me a
look like it was now or never."

Pitt flanker Dwight Collins
observed several Panthers gasping
for life.

“Everyone started hanging their

. heads after the blocked punt,” he

said. “I tried to do something-—
show some spirit.

"When you're down l3-0,"_he
added, “and the defense is playing
as well as they were, the burden is

ii

on US.

Tight end John Brown said,
“We felt that we had to score on the

 

drive following the blocked punt.

“We don’t think about losing,”
Brown noted, saying, “We knew
that we had to do it, and we started
moving the ball in the fourth
quarter.” _ _ _

Indeed, the offense that was list-
less for the first three quarters a-
wakened for the final count, scor-
ing two late touchdowns.

“I was taught that in the heat of
battle, you don’t quit until the last
whistle, or like a boxer, you hang
in there until the 15th round for a.
possible last second knockout,”
said Fazio.

In fact, Pitt took it to the final
bell, narrowly outlasting West Vir-
ginia. After the Mountaineers reco-
vered an onsides kick and ran a few
offensive plays, Paul Woodside,
who had converted his previous 15
field goal attempts, lined up for the
game-tying three-pointer.

“It missed by less than a foot,”
Collins said, taking a deep breath.

“It skimmed the bottom of the
upright,” said free safety Tom
Flynn, who was deep man back at
the goal line.

“It scared me to death," Brown
said. “I thought it was good——yeah,
I lost some hair.”

The West Virginia offensive
line, thinking the kick was good,
leaped in unison. Fazio said hejust
sat there and watched it.

Once again Pitt survived,
remaining alive for the next battle.
West Virginia didn't die easily
either, or so said Mountaineer
coach Don Nehlen.

It's a shame to lose a game like
this," he deadpanned. “Your team
plays so well and you lose. We went
down, but we didn't go without "a
fight."

Unlike Pitt, theyjust didn’t have
the weapons to crank open the
coffin.

ball to Pitt’s 44-yard line.

With only seven seconds left, all
heads were turned to Woodside. If
he connected on the 53-yard
attempt, he would break the NCAA
record of 15 consecutive field goals.

As the ball headed toward the
goal post, there was little doubt
that it had the accuracy, but the
distance? It was short by inches.

It was so close that Flynn, who
was positioned beneath the goal
post at the time, said, “It skimmed
the upright; I heard it squeak.”

The first half provided little
excitement for Panther fans. After
Woodside’s first field goal of 44
yards seven minutes into the first
half, Pitt’s Tim Lewis ran back the
ensuing kickoff for 49 yards.

The other Pitt highlight of the
first half was a Flynn punt return.
Flynn, while looking into the glar-
ing sunlight, fielded the ball deep
in Pitt territory and, after breaking
several tackles, hurled his way to
the 48-yard line for a 43-yard
return.

Although this was the fourth
consecutive game in which the

offense was ineffective during the
first half, Fazio was still pleased
with many performances.

“I thought the offensive line
played very well,” Fazio said.
“They missed a few assignments,
but'I think they won the battle in
the trenches in the third quarter,
and the toll took its place in the
fourth quarter.

“Danny had an outstanding
drive in the fourth quarter,” he
continued. “I think our receivers
made a much better effort.”

Fazio was also pleased with a
number of performances from

Pitt’s younger players, one being
sophomore Caesar Aldisert who is
replacing the injured Rich Kray-
nak at linebacker.

Another outstanding perfor-
mance was turned in by reserve
fullback Bill Beach, who entered
the game after Marlon Mclntyre
left the game late in the first quar-
ter with a leg injury.

“I expected to play some, but not
as much as I did,” Beach said.
Beach, who gained 52 yards——
many of which were earned in criti-
cal situations, added, “I‘m just
glad I could contribute. I was very

pleased to go out and accomplish
something on the field. It was espe-
cially great to come back from such
a deficit.”

Puzzuoli gave credit to Hostetler
for repeatedly bouncing back from
the punishment he was absorbing.

“You’ve got to give him credit;
he got hit, but hejust got right back
up,” Puzzuoli said.

“We played with a lot more
intensity in the last quarter than we
did in the rest of the game,” Marino
said, adding that “it’s a lot easier if
you get up front early.”

Field Hockey Team Savors Taste Of Winning

Some people said it couldn’t be
done; a victory for the Lady Pan-
ther field hockey team in the 1982
season was a totally unrealistic
goal. However, the people who
supported this belief were proven
wrong.

After four previous attempts to
find the winning combination, the
Lady Panthers pieced it all
together and defeated Indiana Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania 3-2 Friday
at Trees Field. And it was no’ ordi-
nary victory.

Lady Panther coach Cindy Bal-
dridge stated, “As a former player
and now as a coach for Pitt, I can

The Pitt Lady Panther cross-
country team won their first dual
meet of the season, defeating
California State of Pennsylvania
27-28 at Falstaff Hill in Schenley
Park.

Amy DiFrancesco won the race,
running the hilly 3.2 mile course in

with a time of 21:09.

The Lady Panthers will next see

' . Booters lose 2-1 

The Pitt soccer team has had
trouble scoring goals during the

1982 season. Maybe the Panthers »

got so frustrated that they had to try
I to shoot at their own goal.

This “own goal” by Pitt gave
Mercyhurst a 2-1 victory. The Lak-
ers opened the scoring in the first
half and held onto that one-goal
lead at halftime. Panther John
Hagenbach tied the game with his
third goal of the season. Four min
utes later, a ‘Panther player
headed the ball into the Pitt net.

Lacrosse club loses in
overtime...

Despite being a young team, the
Pitt lacrosse club has been playing
well. The problem is that the club
is unable to find the link that separ-
ates winning from losing.

The club lost a heartbreaker in
overtime to the West Virginia
lacrosse club 10-9. The winning
goal was scored four and a half
minutes into overtime.

john Atwood was the leading
scorer for Pitt with four goals, fol-
lowed by Randy Bardol with three

and Malcolm McGinnis and John ’

Crouthers with one each.

The club will travel to Ohio this

versity Invitational Tournament
on Oct. 9-10.

truly say that this was one of the
most exciting games ever played in
the history of Pitt field hockey.”

In pro football, overtime is
called “sudden death.” In field
hockey, ”prolonged death” might
be a better way of putting it. After
70 minutes of regulation play that
resulted in a 0-0 tie, Pitt and Indi-
ana entered what could be des-
cribed as either prolonged death or
long-awaited victory, depending
on your point of view.

After first overtime period, the
game remained a scoreless tie.

Hard play by both teams resulted
in a still scoreless game after the
second overtime.

After the second overtime, the
two teams entered a flick-off to
determine the winner.

A flick-off consists of five indi-
vidual penalty strokes taken by five
different players of each team
against the opposing goalie.

Sophomore Deb Madara took the
first stroke for Pitt and put the
Lady Panthers up 1-0 on a shot
into the upper right hand corner of
' the goal cage. Indiana then took its

first stroke and put it past Pitt
goalie Tammy Anderson. Fresh-
man Joann Patterson scored for
Pitt after taking the second stroke
for the Lady Panthers. Anderson
blocked Indiana’s next stroke and
the score was 2-1. Pitt took its next
two strokes but did not score. Indi-
ana tied the game at 2-2 on the
fourth stroke as the ball got past
Anderson.

Sophomore Terry Zygarowicz
took Pitt’s fifth stroke and scored
what was to be the winning goal of
the game as Anderson blocked
Indiana’s final attempt.

Baldridge credited the victory to
every member of the team for out-
standing all—around performances
and said the cheering and support
given by the reserve players and the
fans who attended the game con-
tributed to the Lady Panther’s
victory.

Baldridge summed up the game
stating, “Our victory over I.’U.P.
was a great team effort. We played
with total team unity up until
exhaustion. I feel that after a hard
week of practice and a change in
our style of play, we have finally
found what it takes to win.”

Imagine a long series of upright
domino pieces so close that if one
falls, the rest will topple in
succession.

Now transfer this theory to the
Lady Panther volleyball team.
Each domino represents an oppos-
ing team, and as each comes up
against Pitt, well, the outcome is
obvious. So far, at least.

In short, the Panthers are mow-
ing down the competition in uni-
form fashion. The team left West
Virginia with its fourth consecu-
tive tournament championship.

The invitation’s action started
Friday night when the Panthers
faced Temple and Kent State. The
Owls proved unworthy this time
out, 15-12, 15-7. KentState fared no
better, 15-6, 15-2.

high-flying balloon, 11-15, 15-9,
15-12. The loss was a letdown for
Collier.

“We were disappointed that a
Big East rival like Georgetown
stopped our win streak at 19,” he
indicated. “We expected the streak
to stop while playing the likes of
Penn State or Ohio State.”

Middle blocker Carmen Tapia
expressed similar sentiments. “We
did not play too well,” she said
with a heavily-noted accent. “Eve-
ryone was very excited, we did not
have the calm as before.”

Whatever the problems the team
displayed against Georgetown,
they were dispelled in the finals.
Pitt defended West Virginia 15-13,
15-9, and Rhode Island 13-15, 15-
11, 15-4.

As earlier promised, coach Kay
Corcoran’s Owls also made the
finals, though they lost to Pitt 15-0,
15-8, 15-10.

In the Georgetown match, Pitt
appeared oversure of itself, even

though Temple later defeated the
Hoyas and reached the finals.

Collier called the Hoyas’ win-
over the Lady Panthers the worst
match of the season. “The team
made many mental and physical
errors, and for a brief time, they
(the players) forgot to work
together as a team.

“The players took things for
granted playing Georgeto'wii,"i’l1e
continued. “We were at a point
where everyone thought the team
would always find a way to win.
The loss taught us a valuable
lesson.”

After the defeat, the team held a
meeting and regrouped. Collier
knew they had to pay back some-
body for their loss, and that some-
body was Temple.

The third-year coach said it took
an exceptional game to beat the
Owls 15-0 and called it an impor-
tant preparation for Penn State
(Oct. 8-9).

As the team prepares for its

upcoming four-school invita-
tional, is there any explanation for
the Panthers’ extremely fast start
from the gate? Collier carries with
him ’82 credentials boasting a 21-2
record, achieved by a freshman and
sophomore-dominated team com-
plemented by a few seniors.

“It is an interesting situation,”
he professed. “Earlier, we had
assessed ourselves as a team, and I
communicated to the players what
it would take to win and be success-
ful. It then took mature athletes to
follow through with their pre-
determined goals.”

Collier insists he is coaching a
team with average volleyball skills.
It is a team, though, that does not
permit errors to stand in its path.
After each mistake, the squad has
responded positively.

“It is common,” Collier also
stated, “for mistakes to lead to
more mistakes in women’s sports.
In women’s volleyball, one mistake
can easily lead to more.”

The team also understands it is
of an average nature, but carries
with it a hard-nosed attitude.
Underscoring this, Collier said, are
“players like Sally (Gillespie) and
Carmen who play like seniors, even
though they play under pressure
situations as freshmen."

But perhaps the most important
formula behind this unanticipated
success lies in group cooperation.
Sophomore Judy Young says,

“Everyone gets along real well.”

Bethany.

minutes and never really had a
chance to make a game of it.

The defense was under consider-

style of play, keeping the ball wide
and creating opportunities. At
halftime, they led 4-0.

The second half was much the
same. Although Bethany scored
only one goal, they continued to
dominate the game. Pitt played
well sporadically but couldn’t

of the half. Danny Zamanski took a

the kick to the foot of Sparky
