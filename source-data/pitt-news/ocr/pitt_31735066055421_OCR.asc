School of Engineering clean quits

Chang is Fifth
Pntdeonto
resign this year

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

H.K. Chang resigned his post as
head of the School of Engineering last
Friday, becoming the fifth dean in the
past 10 months to leave Pitt.

Chang has accepted the vice chan-
cellor/president position at the City
University of Hong Kong in China,
his homeland. He is set to leave Pitt
July 1.

“I have enjoyed immensely being’ at
the university and will miss my facul-
ty colleagues, who I know are com-

mitted to moving the School of
Engineering forward,” Chang said in a
press release.

Pitt Provost James Maher said
Chang was instrumental in upgrading
the engineering school.

“In the short time he has served the
university, Chang has been dynamic
in developing a number of initiatives,
such as strengthening manufacturing
engineering and adding two under-
graduate programs,” Maher said in a
statement released by Pitt. “We are
sorry to see him leave.”

Chang’s resignation makes him the
fifth dean and sixth top administrator
to leave Pitt since]. Dennis O’Connor
resigned as chancellor last April.

Over the summer, Business School
Dean H.J Zoffer resigned, as did
Medical School Dean George Bernier
Jr. In early September, College of
Arts and Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe
and Dean of Graduate Studies for the

Chung Moo Doe School taught their "shock, scream and run" self-defense method. l

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Mary
Lou Soffa also resigned their posi-
tions.

In October, Pitt’s number one
fundraiser, Larry Weber, resigned as
vice chancellor for institutional
advancement. Unlike the deans,
Weber left his post immediately to
open a fundraising counseling busi-
ness.

Pitt has not named permanent
replacements for any of these posi-
tions, and along with those, two of the
most prominent jobs at the university,
chancellor and senior vice chancellor
for health sciences, are also unfilled.

A search committee headed by Pitt
trustee James Roddey has been work-
ing since June to find a permanent
chancellor. Former Law School Dean
Mark Nordenberg is serving as Pitt
chancellor in the interim.

beaten and died at the hands
of Brentwood police after a
traffic stop, stood at..the
podium. Gammage’s father,

“On October 12, Jonny

SEACbott|es to end clear-cutting of forests

By Russ Krebs
Staff Writer

You may not know it, but a
felony was committed in
Dining Room A of the
William Pitt Union on Friday
night. That was the night that
the “Roadshow for the
Roadless” took place, and that
was where the felony
occurred.

If you are wondering what
kind of felony was commit-
ted, you are not alone. Both
Robert Hoyt and Ramon
Amon, the people who put on

the show that was sponsored
by the Student Environmental
Action Coalition, wonder the
same thing.

Ramon Amon said, “Idaho
passed a law stating that it’s a
felony to speak against the
logging in Idaho. So, basical-
ly, every time we put on the
roadshow, we are committing
a felony and could be jailed.”

He went on to say that when
this law was being passed, a
senator said, “This is probably
unconstitutional, but we need
to send a message.”

Amon is one of the organiz-

ers of the Cove/Mallard
Coalition to stop the clear-
cutting of forests in a
5,000,000-acre area of wilder-
ness in central Idaho. He said
that there are 200 scheduled
clear-cuts in the area, each
about 30 acres. _
Robert Hoyt, folk musician
and activist, said that the rea-
son the trees are being cut is
to salvage the area. But, “if
you take the “l” out of sal-
vage, you have savage.”
Throughout the evening, the
two intertwined song, lecture
and video into their show.

Most of Hoyt’s songs dealt
directly with Cove/Mallard
'and all of the videos and talks.

Amon started the evening
by stating his name and then
saying that “the_police reports
say Robert Amon, A.K.A.‘
‘Ramon,’ but everyone knows
me as Ramon.”

While trying to stop the
felling of the trees in Idaho,
Amon has been arrested sev-
eral times. When asked how
many times, all he would say
was: “I think civil disobedi-
ence is like sex. If you can

remember how many times
you’ve done it, you haven't
done it enough.”

Why should one care
about some of the trees
being cut down in central
Idaho? '

Amon’s answer was this
analogy: “The ecosystem is
like a plane. You can take a
rivet out here and there, but
eventually you will take too
many, and the plane will
crash.”

Amon and Hoyt feel that
this is what will happen if
the clear-cutting of trees
continues in Cove/Mallard.
There are several endan-
gered species of animals that
call this area their home, and
if it continues to be cut, they
may not survive.

The videos that were
shown portrayed this area as
a picture book of scenery.
There are just trees and
creeks for as far as the eye
can possibly see. Hoyt said,
“This is the only part of the
country where you can go to
a high point at night and not
see anything man-made at
all. Not even a radio beacon,
and those are everywhere.”

Hoyt sang a few more

songs and then said that if
the cutting continues, “we
will be left with a sterile
landscape of barren ground,
and that kills an ecosystem.”

At the end of the presenta-
tion, they both invited every-
one to come out to Idaho this
summer and learn about
Cove/Mallard. They want
people to want to save this
area because they have seen
the beauty and the disgrace,
not because of what they
have heard. They want peo-
ple to want to fight for this
area.

By the end of the evening,
the entire room was singing
and dancing around. Amon
mentioned the button he was
wearing that said, “Wearing
buttons is not enough!” This
is obviously his and the
coalition’s philosophy.

Amon ended the evening
by saying, “Cancel whatever
you are doing this summer
and come to Idaho for a
kick-ass time.” He told inter-
ested students to call (208)

tion. You can also attend

tears. .

Jonny’s mother, Mrs. Narves Gammage,
stood beside Leflore and put her [hand on
Leflore’s shoulder, saying, "‘It’s been a hard
road, an angry road, a sad road that we’ve
gone through.” » V »

Th-is was the solemn.opening to the

at Carnegie‘ Mellon University, a discussion
that promoted the end of police brutality.

City Councilman Sala Udin said that the

Maneia"s father,“ Stevenson Bey; gave his
condolences to the Gammage family and
said that no one knows what is feels like to

“This was really the first national confer-
ence on police brutality,” Pete Shell, con-

ference organizer and Campus Coalition for

Peace and Justice member, said.

People came to the conference not only
from Pittsburgh but also from Philadelphia;
Morgantown; New York; Buffalo; Syracuse;

Cleveland; Atlanta; Athens, Ga.; and‘

Detroit. The conference focused on what
can be done to stop policebrutality and to
make ensure murders like Gammage’s and
Bey’s don’t happen again.

City Councilman Sala U_din said of the
three officers now charged with involuntary
manslaughter in the Gammage case, “There
was nothing involuntary about it.” He said
that he wanted justice for Gammage and
that all ‘five officers should be tried.

Sandi Sherman of the CCPJ said, “I
believe all the police officers should be
tried and serve the maximum sentence.”

The purpose of the conference was to cre-
ate a campaign to pressure the government
and police so that the police who allegedly
murdered Gammage will be prosecuted.

As part of this campaign, the CCPJ and
other community groups plan to stage
protests at the police officers’; arraignment
and trial. -

To stop police brutality in the future,
many of the speakers called for a change in
the system. Findausi Bey said that police
brutality was a product of the “ills of the
system.” '

“You got to change the system. You can’t
just look at the ills of the-system,” heesaid. '

" ._j.' _'They_also .called‘for.peop‘le.in the local.

out. In addition, internal
committees and county commissions on
police brutality don’t work because they are
associated with the local government and
police, who wish to protect themselves.
“For years this [police brutality] has gone

on,” Ervin said, “The state protects this.

The very people you are fighting are the
people who control it.”

Ervin called for amass movement against
police brutality,‘ for communities to orga-

' nize coalitions against abuse by police and

develop a national network against racism
and.police brutality. “It takes civilians to
police the police ,” Ervin Said.

Currently, the CCPJ plans to create a

’ civilianpolice review board in Pittsburgh

and Allegheny County, with powers to sub-

poena officers, review evidence and make

recommendations. It also plans to start up

community-based commissions that will

investigate and pursue cases where civil
righ_ts have been violated, inform residents
about their legal rights and pressure the
governmental and legal bodies that try to
protect corruption in the police system and
officers who commit criminal acts. .

Tim Stevens, the president of the NAACP
in Pittsburgh, said that he will be meeting
with themayor and police chiefs of the
local area.

“The system is bankrupt,” Stevens said,
“It doesn’t work. We need to make a com-
mitment to overturn what is wrong and get
things done right.”

Police brutality isn’t only a local prob- ‘

lem; it’s a national problem. According to
the Department of Justice, _79-,O00 acts of
police brutality" occurred from-1981-’9l
nationally. That’s about 8,000 acts of police
brutality per year.

“Clearly this is an epidemic of police
crime and not isolated incidents of brutali-
ty,?’ Ervin said. 9

There will be more events dealing with
Gammage and police brutality in addition
to the protest at‘ the arraignment and trialof
the officers. The Black Action Society
plans to hold a candlelight vigil at 7:30
p.m. on Feb. 13 at the WPU. Also, "Richard
Lyons, the foreman of the jury at
Gammage’s coroner’s inquest, will speak at
CMU in March. I

The spirit of the conference was best
summed up by Lorenzo Kom’b_oa Ervin:

“Stop police rnuvrder! End police brutality ,

Yes, the president of the United States does know how to sign
his name. Defeating gridlock and temporarily defeating civil
rights groups, President Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress passed the long-awaited telecommunications bill last
week. '

As things usually go with the federal government, this bill is
far from simple and deals with a lot more than one item. It’s
filled with all sorts of goodies, including the V-chip.

There is a lot of talk about what children should and shouldn’t
be watching on television. Groups blame TV violence for
everything from schoolyard fights to serial murder. Television,
they argue, is such a major component in children’s lives that
what children see is often what they do. The movie The
Program was blamed for the deaths of more than one person
who tried to act out a scene from the ﬂick.

Those groups are the ones who lobbied extensively for some
way to monitor what our children are watching, and now they
have it. The miraculous V-chip is a little device which is
installed directly into TV sets in order to allow parents to con-
trol what comes onto the magic little screen. Similar to the way
channels can already be blocked out of cable boxes, now specif-
ic programs labelled with a certain violence rating can be auto-
matically blocked out.

In theory, th-is is ii good thing. There are, to put it simply,
some things children shouldn’t be -watching. However, this
leaves the question of what is and what is not violence up to the
discretion of an unknown agent. Responsibility is removed from
parents, who are the only people who should be monitoring the
TV—viewing habit/s of children. The V-chip is just one more
piece of parental responsibility lifted from the backs of parents
and taken on by tlie federal government.

_Another aspect {of the telecommunications bill which presents
problems is the set of restrictions placed on “pomography” over
the Internet. There is, according to the United States Supreme
Court, no official definition of pornography. But whatever it is,
you’d better not send it over the Internet. This has the potential
to include personal communications between two people. If you
send your boy/girlfriend a sexual message, Big‘Brother might
just see it and arrest you for violating the telecommunications
bill. /

One group speciﬁcally annoyed with the bill is the abortion-
rights group. There is a possibility’ that parts of the bill will
make it illegal for those groups to post information regarding

makes it dangerous to civil rights. 4

How l7KoFesS{oN2L WRQSTLQKS team To Taum”.

 

Are we safe from thetpolice?

Having been raised in the
sedate suburbs of Philadelphia,
I was always fed the image of
police officers as friendly, car-
ing folks. They captured the
bad guys, and they did it with a
wave and a smile to the honest
citizens they served.

Along with most of the other
illusions of my youth, this
vision of the officer‘ as Blue
Knight has been rudely dis-
placed. How could it be other-
wise, ’ with the barrage of
images before us? King,
Gainmage, Antantis —— victims
of brutal beatings. An innocent
Atlanta civilian crawling away
from a gunfight and pleading
for mercy. as plainclothes offi-
cers shoot him to death. The
unﬂinching racism of Mark
Fuhrman. Massive scandals
within Philadelphia, New
Orleans and other cities which
have brought thousands of con-

_ .victions into question.

It is a problem extending far
beyond the sensational cases
plastered across the front page
or the evening news. It reaches
into the streets, homes and

' lives of every one of us.

It‘ extends to an ofﬁcer who
called me and a group of
friends “assholes” and told us
to “Go the f*** home.”
(Excuse me, officer, but I
didn’t know it was illegal to
walk down a street after 2 a.m.)
To cops at a Steeler’s game
who mercilessly berated con-
fused fans. (They hadmade the
mistake of stopping some-
where they didn’t belong to
watch a play.) Toa fellow stu-
dent who found herself sur-
rounded by three police cruis-
ers, lights ﬂashing and sirens
blaring, at 9:00 a.m.
(Obviously, failure to come to
a complete halt at a stop sign is
the mark of a dangerous criini—
na1.)’

Nearly everyone seems to
have a story of unreasonable

treatment by the police. Many _

think little of it; perhaps it is
what we have come to expect.

Greg
Marchand

Is it now normal for cops to be
rude and confrontational?
It seems that a venomous

attitude has set in among our .

police today. All too often,
officers appear to have aban-
doned attempts at enforcing the
law by conventional means.
Their method of operation is
no longer to protect and to
serve, but to demand respect
through fear. _

It is a vicious method which
has sucked police departments
into an abyss of racism, brutali-
ty and hatred. ‘

How did this happen? How
did the honest, caring officer of
yesterday turn into the “pig” of
today? The issues run far too
deep for explication within a
short, subjective column, but I
can wager a few guesses.

I would begin with the
motorization of the police
force. Putting a cop in a car
seems like a good move; it
enhances mobility and allows a
quicker response to emergency

"situations. However, it also

removes officers from the com-
munity they need to become a
part of, turning them into
nameless faces, badges and
guns within intimidating
mobile fortresses. How often
do you see officers smile and
wave from behind the wheel?
As the concept of the “beat
cop” has faded away, officers
have lost any bond they had
with the everyday public.

The community itself has
done its share to deepen the
schism. Disorderly urban envi-
ronments have been breeding
grounds for the bacteria within
our law enforcement and jus-
tice systems. The insistence of

our political leaders upon -

absurd “wars” against drugs,
underage drinking, prostitution
and other non-violent offenses
has siphoned off the manpower
and funding necessary to com-
bat real crime. Urban disorder

cannot be reversed by manda-
tory sentencing, capital punish-
ment, welfare reform or any
other simplistic solutions
which ignore the stark realities
of economic degradation.
Burdened by impossible
mandates and mounting pres-
sures, it was probably
inevitable that the minor ail-
ments within law enforcement
turned into a full-blown epi-
demic.-Corruption and con-
frontation have become the
norms among police depart-

ments, and we must seek new ‘

cures. I would venture the fol-
lowing as possible starting
points.

The dual principles of “to
protect” and “to serve” should

guide law enforcement. Take.

more cops out of their cars and
put them on foot or on bikes.
Trainofficers to interact with

‘the general public in a more

positive manner; ' mutual
respect is a lot more conducive
to order than respect based on
fear and distrust. Enforce stan-
dards among our cops —— it is
difficult to place much trust in
an ofﬁcer who carmot police a
waistline, let alone chase down
a thug. Finally, begin to change
the absurd laws which waste
the efforts of our law-enforce-
ment community on non-vio-
lent offenses.

The catalysts for new
approaches in law enforcement
must be found in the combined
efforts of officers, politicians
and the public. Programs like
Community Oriented Policing

and review boards are positive‘

trends and should be ‘expanded.
Kept in the public eye and
given a chance to pursue a
more reasonable definition of
crime, police departments will
undergo a change for the better.

The job of the Blue Knight is
a demanding one, far too often

glorified or vilified beyond I

reality. It is time to bring our
cops back down to earth.

Greg Marchand is platming to

stay out of trouble for a while.

Ice melts
on Panther

 bench

    

..\

. Columnist ii
Mark
_ Gordon

ile sitting with

some Pittsburgh-area

sports scribes at a
recent Pitt Panther home bas-
ketball game, the question of
Jerry McCullough’s basketball
future was raised.

“You think he’ll be drafted?”
wondered one reporter.

7 Mid to late second round is
what I responded, but if he
were two or three inches taller '
he might be a late ﬁrst rounder.

Maybe those were the words
of an overly optimistic Pitt stu-
dent. _

Because now the ﬁfth-year
senior has a real problem. He’s
no longer the starting point
guard. Head Coach Ralph
Willard wanted toshake up the

struggling Panthers Saturday at '

Providence, and McCullough
didn’t start the game.

And in the final 60 seconds,
as the Friars began to pull
away, cameras peered down a
dejected Pitt bench. Exhausted
and recently fouled out,
Gerald J ordan’s face provided

‘ a glimpse of how the game

went. But a few seats down sat
a player still in his warm-ups,
and it wasn’t one of the walk-
ons. It was McCullough.
McCullough not only didn’t .
start the 80-71 loss to the
Friars, he didn’t play. Not one
second. -
, Forget about McCullough’s
professional basketball future,

' which is pretty bleak now. The

rest of the Panther season is
riding on Willard’s move.

Benchings are good. If a
team is struggling, or, as in
Pitt’s case, is playing with the
emotion of a chair, then starters
deserve to be benched. Give a
reserve player who busts his
butt in practice, like Kevin
Willard, a chance .to spark the
team.

Coach Willard’s way was
right on target, until Pitt inched
closer to the lead through the
second half. That’s when '
McCullough should’ve entered
the game.

But he didn’t, and Pitt lost.
The Panthers are now 9-11,
and a Big East tournament
championship is now their only
ticket to -the NCAAs. Even an
Nl'I‘ bid is in jeopardy; they
must finish at least .500 even to
be considered. . '

No. 21 Pitt ties No. 22 Clarion, l8-l8  

By Geoff Moak
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt wrestling team’s
match against Clarion last
Saturday at Fitzgerald Field
House seemed _ as evenly
matched as it could possibly be.
The Panthers came in ranked
No. 21 in the country; Clarion’s
Golden Eagles were No. 22.

And both teams were undefeat— '

ed in the Eastern Wrestling

League so far this season.

Both teams are ‘still undefeat-
ed in the league. Saturday’s
match ended in an 18-18 tie.

After the 118-pound match, a
tie looked like wishful thinking
for Pitt. Clarion’s Sheldon
Thomas, ranked second in the
country, took Pitt’s Chris

-Stevens to the mat 15 seconds
into the match. Stevens spent

the rest of the short bout on his
back until Thomas pinned him

1:23 into the ﬁrst period.

Things looked especially,

bleak considering Clarion had
another top-ranked wrestler,
No. 8 Bob Crawford, at 126
pounds facing Pitt freshman
Mike Ziska. Ziska, who has
been surprising his coaches all
season long, pulled off his
biggest upset yet, a 9-6 win.
“That was a big upset,” said
Pitt Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer. “We knew the

_ and registered seven assists in 30 minutes of action.

Last Saturday’s Pitt‘-Providence game was overshadowed from
the tip by the absence ‘of Panther guard Jerry McCullough, who
missed his first game this season.

And, after a brief early-i‘lead in the contest, the Panthers were
overshadowed by the Friars, who swept the season series with an
80-71 victory. "  - -

While Head Coach Ralph Willard gave no direct answer for
McCullough’s benching, he did say that the decision came from

more than the guard’s recent leg injury, citing “team chemistry”

as an explanation. _
Coach Willard’s decision left his son Kevin Willard in control

transferring from Western Kentucky, Willard scored 12 points

’ Directing the offense early in the contest, Willard funnelled the
ball to forward Garrick Thomas, who scored the Panthers’ ﬁrst
points with a driving layup. Thomas sank a 3-pointer on the
team’s next possession, giving Pitt a 5-2 lead that would be its
largest and last of the game. The five points were all Thomas
would score in 29 minutes of play. , _ —

‘ Providence’s answer to Thomas was forward Austin Croshere,
who made two foul shots and drained a three of his own to tie
the score. Fellow Friar Derek Brown made a layup on the next
Providence possession and converted a 3-point play soon after to
give the Friars the 10-5 advantage. 

Three-point plays and foul shots took center stage for
Croshere, Brown and their teammates for the rest of the after-
noon. Brown’s team-leading 21 points came with the help of a
seven-for-seven performance from the foul line, while Croshere
scored all but five of his 18 points from the stripe. In all, the
Friars registered 32 points from foul shots, while Pitt managed
only eight.

All the elements were there for

butt off and got it.”

For the first two-and-a-half
periods, the l34-pound- match
was largely a battle for hand
control. In the end, though, it
was a leg takedown that scored
the winning points. Pitt’s John
Richey couldn’t keep his bal-
ance when Chris Marshall
grabbed his leg. Marshall’s
takedown gave him a 3-1 win.

Pitt’s J .J . Fasnacht started out
slow in the 142-pound match
but was in control throughout.
Two quick takedowns midway
through, the third period sealed
the win, a 9-5 decision for
Fasnacht. ' .

In an attempt to squeeze out
any possible extra points,
Stottlemyer shufﬂed his lineup
at 150 and 158 pounds.
Knowing that whoever wrestled
at 158 pounds for Pitt would be
an underdog against Clarion’s
Ken Porter, Stottlemyer wanted

to get as many points as possi-'

ble at 150.

He sent Jacob Schaus, nor-
mally the 158 starter and one of
the team leaders in pins, against
T.J. Carbaugh in the l50—pound
match. The strategy paid off, as
Schaus pinned Carbaugh with
42 seconds left in the match,
giving Pitt its only lead in the
meet, 12-9.

That left Pitt’s regular 150-
pounder, Brett Gould, to face

Young lacrosse teams sets sights on another winning season

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

Tired of supporting a loser? Tired of the
teasing and torment of a Pitt team that shows
promise and then self-destructs at the end of
the season? Look no further than Pitt’s men’s
lacrosse team.

It is 96-25 in the past seven seasons, win-
ning 79 percent of its games. This winning
/ tradition rivals any sports program at this uni-
versity. Head Coach Gary Neff, who is enter-
ing his eighth campaign, needs only four
more victories to reach the 100-win plateau.

“I’m very excited about that, but I don’t
want it to disrupt the team,” said Neff. “It will
come eventually, and it should come at home.
I’m excited about that, and I’m glad I’ve
stuck around here long enough to do that.”

After losing seven of 10 starters to gradua-
tion, Neff is counting on the play of his
sophomore and freshmen classes to get the
team back to the playoffs. Last year was the
first time he ever started a freshmen, and he
could see as many as four starting this season.

“We are really young this year, but our
basic goal is to get back to the playoffs,” said
Neff. “I think that’s an attainable goal. We
have a tough schedule and one of the biggest
since I’ve been here.”

Pitt is one of 85 teams in the National
Collegiate Lacrosse League, a league that has
teams as far south as North Carolina and as
far north as New York. Pitt is in an eight-
team division in which the top two teams

said Neff. “West Virginia is strong and will
be the best competition we’ll see all year.”

Pitt’s team of 26 is returning six players
who had a signiﬁcant amount of playing time
last year. Pitt doesn’t have a superstar to
speak of and will rely on itsdeep bench to win
games.

“We are better from top to bottom than last
year,” said Neff. “A number of people could
start because of our depth.”

Neff cites the defense as the strength of the
team. Senior Dave Walters, junior John Foris
and sophomore Mike Dombowski will lead
the defensive unit that Neff says is “super
strong.”

“There is nobody that works harder or
gives more than Dave does,” said Neff. “John
and Mike are two defensemen that are good
as any in the league. They create our offense
with their great stick handling.”

Neff is expecting big plays from Rob
Heaps, Steve Love, Pete Choi and Bret
Meyerkincack on offense and midfield.

“Rob is a big key to our season. Right now
he is banged up, but he’ll be back for our first
game,” said Neff. “I expect Love and Choi to
have huge seasons, and I need a big year
from Bret.”

In its first scrimmage of the year, the team
fell behind 0-2 to St. Vincent College and
then woke up to score six unanswered goals
to win 7-3. Goals were scored by
Meyerkincack, Choi, John McGrath, Mike
Walters, Joe Divine and Pat Shea. After the
two early goals, Pitt’s defense was strong
behind good checking and goalie play.

The team starts its season by hosting
Western Virginia Community College at 6:30

So McCullough sits on the bench as Pitt’s sea-
son fades into Paul Evans land — such promise
early on, disappointment in the end.

McCullough’s backup, Willard, played surpris-
ingly well. He scored 12 points and dished out
seven assists in 30 minutes. And just as he’s done
all season, he played stingy defense and with a
ton of heart.

But as much as I admire Willard’s work ethic,
he’s not a premier Big East point guard. If he
were, he’d already have moved McCullough out
of the starting lineup. No one is going to confuse
Willard with Allen Iverson or Doron Shefer.

This isn’t the first time this season Willard has
benched his point guard. In a Christmas break
game against Prairie View, McCullough sat as
Pitt romped the Panthers from Texas,lOl-59.

Maybe Willard, thinking back to better times

like December, wanted to give his team a refresh-
er course on intensity and hit them where it hurts
— playing time.

He might have wanted to send a message to the
team that if you don’t play with heart you don’t
play. If so, Willard went straight to the top.
McCullough is arguably the Panthers’ best play-
er, and he’s unarguably their most emotionless on
the court.

Maybe it’s just a quick, one-game lesson, and
McCullough will start Tuesday at Notre Dame.

I hope that’s all it is. Hopefully McCullough
learned that he needs to shed his “ice” image and
play with more intensity. And hopefully Willard
learned that a trip to post-season play runs
through Jerry McCullough.

Porter at 158 pounds. Down 1-0 with 30 seconds left, Gould shot
for a takedown, but Porter avoided him and reversed the move,
scoring a takedown himself. Porter won the bout 3-1, knotting the

team score at 12.

“We hoped for six points at 150, and we got it,” Stottlemyer
said. “I thought we could win at 158. I don’t know if it would have
worked out the other way. I think we did the right thing.”

Pitt’s Joel Giroski came out on fire against Clarion’s ninth-
ranked Paul Antonio, scoring a takedown a minute into the 167-
pound match. But by the end of the first period, Antonio was
ahead 3-2, and he never lost the lead again, eventually winning 8-

Bryan Matusic got the points right back for Pitt. Matusic scored
a takedown 2:05 into the 177-pound match and led the rest of the
way, defeating Juggy Franklin 6-2 to tie the team score at 15.

The 190-pound match got started slowly but finished with a
bang. Pitt’s fifth-ranked Mark Bodo trailed No. 2 Bryan Stout 3-2
as time wound down. With 10 seconds left in the match, Bodo
tried desperately to get a takedown, but Stout fought off the ﬂurry
and held on for the win, putting Clarion ahead by three with one

match to go.

Pitt heavyweight Pat Wiltanger seemed content to fight a defen-
sive battle rather than go for a pin to try to win the meet for Pitt.
He scored a 1-0 decision over Darren Jarina to make the final team

score 18-18.

“We didn’t want to lose. Pat wrestled a conservative match. Can
you fault him for that? Yes, you probably can,” Stottlemyer said.

“But he didn’t beat himself.”

Friars

.oFrom page 6

“We’re making ridiculous
fouls,” said Coach Willard,
who blamed the bad fouls for
ruining “the best offensive
game we’ve played in a long
time.” -

While Kevin Willard ran the
offense, Chad Varga dominated
it, scoring 24 points and dou-
bling Willard’s second-highest
total. Varga opened Pitt’s sec-
ond-half scoring with a slam
dunk before scoring 10 of the
team’s first 12 points for the
period. —

Later in the half, despite
being moved to center in Pitt’s
four-guard offense, Varga
nailed a 3-pointer to bring the

Panthers to within four at 56-
52. Three foul shots pushed the
Friar lead back to seven, but a
Gerald Jordan dunk, two Kevin
Willard foul shots and a
Willard 3-pointer tied the game
for the first time since late in
the first half.

Providence was forced to use
its last time-out to stop Pitt’s’
momentum at the 5:32 mark of
the second half. Friar coach

Pete Gillen’s advice hit home -

with freshman Jamel Thomas,
who made a reverse layup right
after the break. Croshere made
two of his 13 foul shots on the
next possession, putting the
Friars up by four at 63-59.

pull the Panthers to within one,

was intentionally fouled by '

freshman Vonteego Cummings
before he could finish his
drive. Brown made the two
foul shots, and Providence

“when you’re in that situation,
you have to make the right

praised the .team’s physical
play. '

“We got after it, we

— scrapped, we hustled,” said the

coach, whose undersized team
finished only two rebounds
behind the Friars for the game.
“We played with pride. We
played with ﬁre.”

Varga led the team with eight
boards, while Thomas finished
with five rebounds to go with
his eight points. Starting center
Mark Blount, who played just
five minutes in the contest,
registered two boards and one
blocked shot while being held

_ scoreless.
