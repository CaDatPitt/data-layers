when Rogers received a letter ﬁom the

Proposal cuts

Governor's

Schools‘. funds

by Jen Hirsch
For T/9e Pitt New

Gov. Ed Rendell’s proposed
budget for next year would slash
two programs Pitt has been offer-
ing for years.

Rendell’s proposal would cut
the $3.2 million per year that pays
for the tuition and room and board
of students attending the Gover-
nor’s Schools of Excellence, com-
petitive programs that prepare high
school students for careers in the
arts, teaching and agricultural sci-
ences, among other subjects.

He was forced to make a
difficult decision in this
unprecedented economic

downturn.

Chuck I 2’
do

In the past, Pitt has hosted the
programs for students interested in
health care and international stud-
ies.

Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for
Rendell, said the governor called
the programs, which the state has
offered to students since 1973,
“one of the governor’s favorite[s].”

“He was forced to make a difﬁ—
cult decision in this unprecedented
economic downturn,” he said.

But that didn’t soften the blow
to some Governor’s School alum-
ni.

Pitt sophomore and Pennsylva-
nia Governor’s School for Health
Care alumna Kim Autore said, “I
think legislators would be making
a huge mistake. It  offers oppor-
tunities unlike anything ‘else to high
school students.” .

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
it’s important to remember that this
is just a proposal, and there will
be negotiations for the next ﬁve
months about what options exist
for these programs.

Some students burned couches
Others tore down  signs and

And now there are those who are
setting out to fix the damage
This past weekend, Pitt student
Marc Schutzbank created a Facebook
group called, “I Rioted .Peacefully.”

“Fix Riot Damage Fund” to show
that Pitt students care about cleaning
up the University.

Schutzbank is still  out the
logistics of the fund with Student Life.

_ In the meantime, he said, students

«who want to contiibute money can

join the Facebook group and contact

him for more information.
Schutzbank said he has already

These  are what stands out

many people may have had the mis-

Pitt sophomore Amanda Wash-

because she thought that it was a step
in the right direction. .

“I feel that sometimes the people
of Oakland have this negative conno-

the street yelling— and even those who
don’t care about spo ” she said.

SGB revokes allocations

cap for Pitt's club sports

by Simone Cheatham
Staff IV/‘its/'

Student Government Board revoked
the competition cap for club sports groups
during Tuesday night’s meeting.

' Starting this fall, club sports. organi-

. zations will be able to request any dollar

amount for items like tournaments, food
and traveling and lodging expenses.

SGB President Kevin Morrison said‘ the
decision follows several years of ‘long dis-
cussions among board members about the
$5,000 cap. .

“The allocations committee can’t break
the competition cap under any circum-
stances,” said Morrison. “Doing away with
the cap allows the people who know the
most about the topic on the table, alloca-
tions, to make proper "decisions about what
these sports groups need.”

’ Catherine Scaccia, a member of ' Lady
Panthers Club Soccer,‘ said she thought the
decision was great because it would benefit
club sports groups, especially in a competi-
tive sense. - i  ‘ '

“This will allow us to readjust our plans
a lot easier than we can right now,” said
Scaccia. “Right now, we’re always worried
about whether or not one tournament

will hinder us competing in another tour-
namentbecause of a money issue. This’ll
make things a lot easier for all of us.”

Bill Egan, president and captain of ‘

Men’s Panther Lacrosse, agreed.

“There’s no reason to limit our sports
teams over a simple number,” said Egan.
“This is definitely a step in the right direc-
tion as far as getting recognized by the Uni-
versity for us.”

Egan experienced the effects of the
competition cap ﬁrst—hand. Before the
board revoked the cap, SGB had. to post-
pone two of the team’s allocations requests
to crunch numbers. ‘

“This is evidence of what the cap does,”
said Egan. “We aren’t even asking for food
or anything, just basic travel and lodging.
Hopefully this can be avoided more easily
once the cap is officially removed.”

Morrison agreed the decision would be
good regarding club sports teams, but said
he wanted to make sure that groups would
not automatically receive funding because
of the cap removal.

“Under no circumstances does this
mean that club sports groups will receive
more funding because there’s no cap,” said
Morrison. “I just want to make that abso-
lutely clear.”

Pitt’s administration has also been cu-

While was walkingwith a friend

Pitt's budget is not in line with reality

by Jacob Brown
Colum/ulit

Battle strategies for combat-
ing the recession have become

‘so commonly advertised that it

almost seems trendy. Cut this, get
rid of that, freeze the budget for
something or another. And Pitt
seems to be no different

Since Pennsylvania decided to
withhold $11.3 million in funding
in December because of the state’s
own budget crunch, no one has
really had a choice but to buckle
down around here. Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg has taken up
the task of making each educa-
tional department except health
sciences reduce its budget for the
next ﬁscal year. But I’m not so sure
he’s doing it right.

Pitt already isn’t a cheap school
to attend. Because of the price
of admission, we expect excel-
lence in education _here with in-
timate and enlightening classes.
But as English depatrnent Chair
David Bartholomae mentioned
in an article last week, class sizes

might be doubling in the name
of consolidation. Some electives
may be dropped-and focus may be
brought on only bare-bones essen-
tials instead. Goodbye Blood and
Empire, Iguess. .

Pending what happens, it will
probably impact the quality of
oureducations. As students, we’ll
be paying for less. But will we be
charged for less? Not likely.

A Dec. 4, 2008, University
Times article reported that Pitt’s
trustees voted to raise faculty
salaries 4 percent over the cur-
rent $121,900 average_duiing the
next school year. Pitt’s Ofﬁce of
Institutional Research found this
ﬁgure to be some $5,500 higher
than the national median for pub-
lic schools. ’

Apparently Pitt is a nice place
to work if you’re a professor. ‘

The trustees also decided to
freeze their own salaries, rang-
ing" from the secretary’s salary of
$190,000 to the dean of the School
of Medicine’s at $702,000, with
Nordenberg’s right in the middle
at $460,000. This, at least, seems
responsible.

But under Nordenberg’s cur— '

rent contract, he’ll get a $75,000

i bonus just for making it to June

2009. That’s right, his retention
clause states that if he doesn’t
ﬁnd a better job in the meantime,
he will earn enough in a bonus to
pay for a new associate professors
yearly salary,

The last time the board froze
the chancellor’s salary — 1996,
following former Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor’s resignation
—— it stood at $225,000. A Sept.

_26, 1996, University Times article

also said that Nordenberg would
receive a personal car with a driver,
a membership to the Duquesne
Club and a serni—furnished house,
among many other perks provided
by the University.

The chancellor also gets a mem-
bership to another club where he
can “entertain prospective donors
and business associates,” no doubt

a helping hand in seeking'dona-

tions from generous benefactors.
So without a doubt, Nordenberg
deserves the extras from that per-
spective.

Butin a year when CEOs are

undergoing endless scrutiny for
their exploitation of luxuries while
the common man is struggling
to make ends meet, does it send
a good message to us regular Joe
Schmoes out there that he’s get-
ting a bonus that’s larger than most
Americans’ salaries?

Like the many corporate execu-
tives who are  voluntary pay
cuts, some college presidents have
stepped up as well. For instance,
Stanford’s John L. Hennessey took
a 10 percent reduction in pay for
2009. If reductions, £atlier than
just stagnation, have to occur, the
buck has to stop somewhere. And
that somewhere should be at the
top.

Alas, every major university
should have an obligation to its
constituents. With the national
unemployment rate at 7.6 percent
and Goldman Sachs economistjan
Hatzius projecting a jump to 9 per-
cent by the end of the year, paying
for college will undoubtedly get
tougher for some people and their
potentially jobless parents.

Yet somehow, no one has men-
tioned a  about tuition costs

for next year. The only certainty we
have is that it’s never gone down.

Because of this, attrition of I

good students is bound to occur.

' It’s an unnecessary side effect that

comes from the school worrying
too much about balance sheets
and not enough about the general
well-being of the ‘student body.

When we chose to come to
Pitt, we were promised boundless
opportunities and diversity. We
were promised that as much ef-
fort as we gave, we’d get that much
support back from the school and
its faculty.

And now that we’re in a crimch,
it seems we’re  those possi-
bilities in the itinerary. Instead of

_widespread publication of sen-

sible ideas — like locking in diesel
prices for our buses while it’s still
cheap, revising ‘routes or subsidiz-
ing increased costs with the mas-
sive funds our school has raised —
we’re~talking about cutting classes
and department budgets at the ex-
pense of education. Since when is

Possibility of OS X on aPC brings Appleto court

Apple Computer Inc has long been
extremely protective of its operating
systems and its hardware, forming a
universe of “closed systems” develop-
ment to rival the “open systems” stan-
dard of Microsoft and others. .

Apple had offandon success with
this approach, producing, with Macin-
tosh OS X, an arguably more reliable

Proponents of Apple commonly
claim that Apple ‘just works,” as Apple
keeps a tight control over the hardware
and software its Macintosh computers

reliability comes at a cost of price-inﬂat-

so far as to ﬂirt with illegality and

much as the shotwas Wanamakefs do-

“When you got a great point guard
like him, you just got to make the shot,”
said Wanamaker. “He puts us in situa-

Alex Rodriguez is on the hot seat following a report that surfaced last week that he used

game and reporters will forgive him for it. He
hopes thattellingthe truthnowwillgethimoff
the hook later. '

Sure, he’ll lose some fans and the respect of
many in the game, namely sports writers and the
like, who will ultimately decide if one day he is
worthyofhavinghis faceenshtinedinbronzein
up-state New York. He has avoided having to sit
in frontof agrand  andbeingiidiculedin the
court of public opinion about whether he is 
or not Because hey, he admitted he was wrong

Hemayalsohavegivenupthreeseasonsof
his career to steroid—pumped numbers, but Ro-
driguez wants everyone to know he’s still got nine
other big league years that were supposedly clean
that can deﬁne his career. .

Rodriguez is one of the best and most ver-
satile players in the game today, and no one will
dispute that He is  on 553 career home

runs at the age of 33. He’s got just about as good A

a chance as anyone in the history of the game to
one day be the all—time home run  and even
be the first player to potentially eclipse 800 ding-

ers for his career

He won’t turn into Barry Bonds and he won’t
become the next Roger Clemens And because
of that, A—Rod believes you should toss him a
clean slateandgivetheguyabreak.

But are sports fans supposed to be satisﬁed
that Rodriguez at least admitted to cheating? Af-
ter he broke the rules and defaced the sanctity of
the game, we should laud his honesty and accept
his apology all because he didn’t continue to lie?

Aside from a total lack of accountability,
the “Steroid Era” has diluted concepts that are
traditionally just as American as baseball itself.
honesty, hard work and belief in the power of
determination.

Rodiiguez simply becomes another big name
cheat, another athlete slowly chipping away at the
integtity of sport as a whole Competition and
pride have been replaced with money and self—
promotion.

The idea of baseball as Ame1ica’s pastime no
longer exists. Thank you, Rodriguez.

But at least he told the truth, right?
