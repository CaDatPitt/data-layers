For P i t t Ne ws

Both Teams Unbeaten

By William H. Herbert
Sports Editor of The Annapolis Log.
Special to The Pitt News——When
the Navy schedule for the present
football season was published last
winter the Midshipmen took one look

and shuddered. After a disastrous
season the department of athletics
had made contracts with the stern-

est competition of the East, and had
of course included Notre Dame in,
the schedule. Pennsylvania, Notre’
Dame, Columbia, Princeton and Army
came on successive Saturdays. And
to add to the general feeling of woe,l
there was Pittsburgh, the third game.
of the season. No wonder, as the’
Midshipmen looked over the recordl
of the Panthers for the 1932 season,‘
that there were groans and moans. l

But now the situation has improved.
Last spring a change was in the
air; early in the fall of this year a
change was in the air;and now a
change is deﬁnite. Navy has shown.
in the ﬁrst two games of the present
season, a decided improvement over
the teams of the past three years, This
improveent lies almost entirely in
the running attack which, because of
inferior blocking, has been entirely
too weak in past years. But this
year the backs are blocking well,
the line ‘is holding well and the Navy
squad goes to Pittsburgh, not by any
means the favorite, but with more
than just a hope of victory.

Navy realizes, both within the
squad and in the regiment of Mid-
shipmen, that this ball game with
Pitt tomorrow is the ﬁrst real test
of their strength, and Navy intends
to show a strong team in this first
test. Pitt. they know, is a team not

Stroyd Selects
Hop Committee

 

 

Five Women Included On Stall‘
Of Twenty Sophomores

Arthur Stroyd, C36, recently ap-
pointed chairman of the Soph Hop,
has selected 20 members of the class
to serve on his committee. Five Of

these are women. ,

The business manager of the affair!
will be Robert Kaufman, C, a member,‘
of Druids and of Pi Lambda Phi so--
cial fraternity. Stroyd is a member
of Delta Tau Delta.

The dance will take place on Fri-
day, November 3. Neither the ball-
room nor the orchestra has been de-
cided upon, but Stroyd has asserted
that the latter will deﬁnitely be a
"name” band——an orchestra with a
national reputation. A number of
broadcasting units are under consid-
eration.

The committee includes: Louise

Nationality Club
Delays Petition

 

 

Formichella’s Letter To McCune
Asks Charter Postponed

The International Council, govern-
ing group of the nationality clubs on
the campus, will postpone indeﬁnite-
ly the presentation of its petition for
a permanent charter from student re-
lations committee, announced Emeric
Formicheila, C34, chairman of the
group, late yesterday.

Although no reasons were given by
Formichella for the postponement, it
came as a result of the delayed action
on the petition in last week's student
relations committee meeting. Form-
ichella’s letter last week to Ray Mc-
Cune, E34, chairman of student re-
lations committee, asking for a delay
on the petition, stopped action on the

affair.

Raw Meat, Hamburgers,
Liver. Balanced Diet
For Panther Cub

A balanced diet of hamburger
and liver will keep Pitt's new
panther cub satisﬁed with its
Pitt habitat if the directions that
come with the animal are correct.
And just in case its keepers get
nervous, the Pitt News prints
rules for the case of the cub:

1. Don’t handle when it ﬁrst
arrives. It’s afraid after its long
trip and will bite or claw you.

2. It eats nothing but raw
meat.

3. Feed it as much lean beef as
it will eat up right away.

4. Don’t give it any tainted
meat.

5. Very lean meat diet with
hamburger once a week,

6. Liver once a. week in the
diet acts as 8. medicine.

7. Give it m_ilk,to drink once in
a while.

Pre-Eds, Faculty
Advisers Confer

Education Staﬁ' Members Meet
Freshmen Today At 12:30

Letters were sent this week to
pre-education freshmen, informing
them of their advisers for 1933-34, ac-
cording to an announcement made
by Theodore A. Siedle, assistant to
the dean of the School of Education.
The ﬁrst meeting of the freshmen
with their faculty advisers is sched-
uled for today at 12:30 o’clock in
various class rooms on the campus.

Members of the staff of the pro-
fessional division of the School of
Education will act as advisers to the
freshmen. This is done to further
the professional interests of students
as early as their freshman year even
though they are not eligible for ad-
mission to the School of Education
proper until the junior year.

Under the plan of organization,
which became effective in Septem-
ber, 1932, students interested in pre-
paring for teaching remain in the pre-
education group in the college dur-
ing their ﬁrst two years at the uni-
versity. At the end of their soph-
omore year they must apply for ad-
mission to the school.

According to Mr. Seidle, admission
is based on the following criteria:
superior intelligence rating, better
scholarship average in all subjects,
superior scholarship in the subject
of major interest in which the stu-
dent will do practice teaching, a sat-
isfactory health rating. special abil-
ity in preliminary professional edu-
cation courses and the satisfactory
results of a personal interview with
a representative of the faculty com-
mittee on admission,

Council Requests
Dance Petitions

Discusses Victory Song, Plan For
Student Suggestions

 

Freshman dance petitions, a new
Victory song, and a proposal for stu-
dent suggestions on future Student
Council business were discussed at
Council meeting in the Cathedral
Wednesday evening.

Petitions for the Freshman dance
chairmanship, it was decided, will be
available at the dean of men’s ofﬁce
beginning Tuesday, October 17. They
must be returned, signed, to the dean
by noon of the following Monday,
October 23, A special council meet-
ing at 4:30 o'clock the same afternoon
will ballot upon the petitions. Peti-
tioners should include a letter to
Council with their requests.

Announcement of the new Pitt Vic-
tory song was made, along with a re-
quest that the Pitt News print the
words in today's issue. Scott Turner,
E35, chairman of the investigations
committee, reported that the Cathe-
dral bell system is now working, but
that additional smoking rooms, due
to lack of space, cannot be obtained.

The combined meeting of the Student
Council of Tech, Duquesne, and Pitt,
he also stated, has been postponed
until the evening of October 25, when
the school groups will attempt to re-
duce trolley rates for students.

Cooperation with the YMCA, George
Roll, Ed34, chairman of the assemblies
committee, declared, will lead to
signing of prominent speakers on the
campus. Tentatively, Kirby Page is
scheduled for a Pitt appearance in
January.

Upon the motion of Jules Green,
C35, Council decided, “At I.r1id-semes-
ter, of each semester, the Pitt News

shall publish a blank upon which stu-
dents so interested shall write sug-
gestions for business which Council
should take up during that semes-
ter.”

Late Bulletin!

The Pitt News office was sad-
dened yesterday by the untimely
death Wednesday night of “Little
Mike,” Pitt's new live Panther
mascot. Passing into Panther
Paradise in the arms of David
Immerman, business manager of
the Pitt News, the little fellow
fell the victim of fright and con-
stipation just after he had had his
picture taken and was ready to
become a Pittsburgh celebrity to-
night. ,

Hurried arrangements yester-
day afternoon rcsultcd in obtain-
ing another baby Panthcr, Immer-
man said this morning, and
“Mike The Second” will become
Pitt's official mascot tonight.

 

 

In a gala celebration at the War-
ner Theatre downtown this evening
at 8 o'clock, the :’University of Pitts-
burgh will accept its live panther
cub mascot. With hosts of students,
cheerleaders, the Pitt band and mem-
bers of the football team and the
coaching staff present, the manage-
ment of the Warner theatres will pre-

sent to the school a four-months-old

panther cub.

The cub arrived by plane yester-
day from New Mexico, ready for the
festivities at the Warner Theatre
this evening. Unusual enthusiasm
greeted the announcement of the
present in the Pitt News last Tues-
day and campus sentiment over the
panther cub has been pitched to a
level exceeding that of the Notre
Dame game here last year.

Two buses will transport the en-
tire University band to the Warner

Pitt Welcomes
Alumni Group
In Homecoming

Rival Coaches Speak At Smoker
Tonight; Pep Classes
Before Game

25,000 To Celebrate

What promises to be the most live-
ly and the largest alumni gathering
in the history of the school is expected
to celebrate Pitt homecoming this
week-end, according to C. VV. Ridinger,
president of the Pitt General Alumni
Association.

Coming just before the Pitt-Navy
tussle, the alumni affair is expected to
occupy the most conspicuous position
on this week's social calendar, and re-
ports have it that “this will be some-
thing for Pittsburgh to talk about for
weeks to come.” Tonight and tomor-
row will be crammed with smokers,
class reunions, and luncheons.

A smoker, at which Pitt alumni
members will be guests of the Gen-
eral Alumni Association, will usher in
the series of events. Several thous-
and Pitt alumni from the tri-state
district will attend. More than thirty
former Pitt football stars will be
there at the Hotel Schenley tonight.

Jock Sutherland and Rip Miller,
rival coaches, will give short talks.

A score or more of high ranking
Naval officers will accompany the
Navy team here, Among those who
will speak at the smoker are Admiral
William -H. Stanley, chief of naval
operations; Rear Admiral W. D.
Leahy, chief of the bureau of Navi-
gation; Rear Admiral T. C. Hart, su-
perintendent of Naval Academy; Cap-
tain G. W. Wilcox, director of ath-
letics at the Academy; Captain R. S.
Holmes, commandant of the midship-
men; and Captain T. T. Caldwell.

Preceding the game, class reunions

will be held in campus buildings and ‘

local hotels, Special luncheons will
be sponsored by a number of class or-
ganizations, and the homecoming
weekend will end with fraternity
dances, Saturday evening.

Plans are being made to entertain
approximately 25,000, with most _of
them from the tri-state district,

Rushing Season
To Close Sunday

 

Silence Period Begins At 2 A. M.;
Interviews Monday

   

The activities of rushing season
will come to a complete halt at 2
o’clock Sunday morning when that
period ends and silence is in order
for all rushees.

From that hour until 5 o’clock
Thursday afternoon no man who has
accepted rushing invitations through
this last week may speak to members
or pledges of fraternities which have
entertained him.

Fraternities will submit all bids to
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to the
dean of men, at 8:30 o’clock Monday
morning, From then until the lifting
of silence Biddle will interview all
bidders and receive their answers to
Invitations to pledgeship. At the ap-
pointed time on Thursday, all men
who will have accepted bids will be
the guests of honor at their chosen
fraternities, They will be officially
pledged at dinner that evening.

Practically all fraternities are
sponsoring dances tomorrow night to
round out the program for the week.
The probability is that most fraterni-
ties will attend the Navy game to-
morrow afternoon in a body, taking
along a good share of rushees and
perhaps “dates.”

Biddle has come through with his
traditional semi-annual prediction of
the number of bids which will be ex-
tended Monday, and the number he
estimates will be accepted before
Thursday. This information appears
elsewhere in the paper.

did they show anything to indicate
that they should go into this game
with Navy the favorites.

'l‘he Middies come here touted to be
one of the strongest teams in the
east. Thus far they have turned in
victories over William & Mary and
Mercer, defeating the latter team by
a one touchdown greater margin than
did the Army.

“Rip” Miller, former Notre Dame
star now a Navy coach, has a veteran
squad this year. From last year’s
first team only three players, Camp-
bell, fullback, Reedy, left guard, and
Kane, right tackle, were lost through
graduation. Back this year are
“Fid” Murray, captain and left end,
-“Butch” Harbold, one of the best
centers in the country last year, Gor-
don Chung-Hoon, speedy Hawaiian
halfback, “Ben” Wa.lkup, right half-
back, and other lesser lights.

The Midshipmen will probably line-
up with Murray and Mandelkorn at the
ends, Brooks and C. H. Clark at the
tackles, Zabriskie and Johnson at the
guards, Harbold at center, Becht at
quarterback, Chung-Hoon and Walkup

Says NRA Gives Extened Power
To Government And Industry

“The National Industrial Recovery
Act has taken more personal freedom
away from the people of this nation
than did the Eighteenth Amendment.

These were the words with which
E. A. Holbrook, dean of the school of
engineering and mines, opened his
address to the Inquiry Club last Wed-
nesday on “With the N, R. A. in
Washington.”

“In fact," Holbrook continued, “so
revolutionary are the provisions of
this act, that except for the existing
emergency, it would have been de-
clared unconstitutional.”

“The N. I. R. A.,’’ be explained,
“contains three points with which
every one should be familiar: (1) the
right of industries to form combina-
tions in spite of the existing anti-
trust law; (2) the right of employee
to -bargain collectively with their em-
ployer.s—the most drastic and far-
reaching step ever taken by the gov-
ernment in industry,” Holbrook said;

“and (3) governmental supervision

PITTSBURGH FOOTBALL FANS will get a treat to-
morrow when Pitt oﬁicially accepts its live Panther
mascot. With the Navy goat jealously looking on across
the ﬁeld, Pitt’s four-month-old Panther will take the cen-
ter of the stage in the day’s colorful gridiron ceremo-
nies. Although Pitt has for years held the Panther as
its mascot, this marks the ﬁrst time that a live Panther
has represented the University.

Simultaneously, the Pitt Victory Song, a new football
march written for the University by Benjamin Levant,
Louis M. Fushan, and Norman Reis, well-known Cap and
Gown show composers, will be ﬁrst heard in the Sta-
dium.

As expressions of University spirit the Panther cub
and the Victory song are welcome additions to Pitt.

Recent pillaging of oﬁices in the Cathedral of Learn-

yesterday that keys, money, and stamps had been stolen

identity of the thief was available. University authori-

before it becomes too widespread and moves into State

merely ride down two or three ﬂoors and make students
waiting to get to Alumni Hall late for classes. It has
been too evident of late that students with classes on
the tenth ﬂoor will ride down to another class on the
eighth ﬂoor and heighten the congestion on the eleva-
tors. Vifalking down two or three ﬂoors should be not
too much effort when one has ten whole minutes to get

TRIALS ON PITT’S new Grid-Graph on Wednesday

afternoon again proved the workability of the ma-
chine which is to dramatize play-by-play the Pitt-Minne-
sets. and Pitt-Notre Dame football games. James Dana-
hey, C34, chairman of Council’s Grid-Graph committee,
has been working overtime lately in an attempt to make
the Minnesota Grid—Graph game a success. His energy
and enthusiasm are commendable and will probably re-
sult in two of the greatest affairs ever seen at Pitt.

Extensive publicity will be given the Graph, Dana-
hey intimated yesterday, and students are urged to sup-
port this Council move. Tests with play-by-play reports
of the Pitt-West Virginia game on Wednesday afternoon
proved to the members of the committee and their in-
terested guests that the Grid-Graph will succeed.

A LETTER OF PRAISE (after all these years) came

to the editor’s desk yesterday just as this stuff was
being pounded out on an aged Pitt News tyepwriter.
“Give credit where credit is due,” the letter said in part,

and editors who gather news from the far corners of the
campus. Neither of the downtown papers has a thing
on the Pitt News.”

The praise showered on Pitt News reporters and copy-

students know the real work that reporters and copy-
readers on the Pitt News staff go through to produce a
paper twice a week. But whether or not the downtown

First,

either of the above mentioned reasons, and the football fan who

Pitt has not lost to an eastern opponent since Tech eked out a 6-0 de-

Navy and Pitt are regarded, this year, as the logical

contenders for the mythical eastern title, and probably national honors.

The Goal:

ped on by practically anyone worth mentioning, and even by some not

worth mentioning in polite company.

The Navy team that trots out on the

two performances this year, may even live up to that prediction.

teams are undefeated and untied, and

of one of them. Your guess is as good, and probably better than mine on

the outcome.

Corr Conditions Swim

Team For Speed Trials

 

After devoting the ﬁrst two weeks
of swimming practice to the con-
ditioning of his natators Coach Pat
-Corr declares that they a.re now ready
for speed trials and individual in-
struction.

The senior AMA championship
meet, which is three weeks away,
gives Corr little time to round out
a winning team. In spite of the
large squad the task of correcting
ﬂaws in swimming form will be great-
ly reduced by the fact that most of
the squad have been under the tute-
lage of Corr for at least a year or
more. It is to the freshman team

that Corr will have to give individual
instruction.

lief that any boy who is sound of
limb and free from heart trouble can
become a varsity letter-winner by
conscientious practice, that he and
his associates will stage the second
annual Fall Track and Field Games
next Wednesday and Friday after-
noons. The games will be purely for
novices-—men who have had no active
participation on Pitt track teams. All
those who have earned either letters
or numerals are deﬁnitely barred from
the competition. _

On this page is a blank which will
serve as a valid entry for the meet
when properly ﬁlled out and de1iVel‘ed
to the Stadium oﬂice. The blank also
supplies all details of the meet and
all rules. It is important to note that
the track events, the pole _vault, and
the running broad and high jumps
take place in the Stadium Wednesday,
October 18, and that the javelin, dis-
cus and weight events will be run off
at the football practice ﬁeld, Friday,
October 20, _

Medals of gold and silver, and rib-
bons await the place winners in
each event. These awards will be
presented at the Track and Field get-
together Tuesday evening, October
24, at 7:30 o'clock in the Student Ac-
tivities building,

The meet will furnish an opportu-
nity for fraternities to get a line on
their track talent for next spring’s
interfraternity competition. Although
no team scores will be kept oﬁicially,
unoﬂieial tabulations may be made by
the fraternities.

Thus far the reply to Olsen’s invi-
tation has been in the form of ﬁfty
entries for the games. For anyone
else who is able to walk up to the
Stadium, there's a pair of track shoes
and a natty track uniform waiting.

Pitt Strength
Tested By Navy

(Continued From Page One.)
to be reckoned with lightly by, any
opponent and so the Middle squad
has spent weeks of practice prepar-
ing for this one game.

Navy's backﬁeld this year has
shown a versatile attack in the ﬁrst
two games. Speed, blocking ability
and reserve power are fully present
and in Baumberger, left half; Chung-
Hoon, left half; Clark and Larsen,
fullbacks, and Borries, right half, the
Midshipmen ﬁnd ground for hope of
a successful season. Walkup, too, at
right half. has demonstrated ability
in sweeping the ends, and to him
goes a large part of the job of the
backﬁeld. Passers are Baumberger
and Chung-Hoon, kickers are Clark,
Larsen, Baumberger and Chung-
Hoon and all of them are of above
average ability in these departments
of the game. ,

The forward wall of the present
squad has been juggled a fairly large
extent this year. A large number of
men, many of them “youngsters,”
have had a chance to play. But re-
serve strength there is not plentiful
and injuries to players in the line
might seriously cripple Navy for the
remainder of the season. Harbold,
center; Captain Murray, left end, and
Brooks, left tackle, can probably be
considered the most capable men in
the line, since injuries in the Mercer
game cost the squad two men in
both the line and backﬁeld.

Ground-gaining ability in the Navy
camp this year has been almost en-
tirely in the running attack. Passes
have been few and on the whole not
satisfactory. Punting, too, has been
weak, though the kickers on the
squad have shown up fairly well in
practice during this week. But end-
runs and oifi-tackle smashes have
netted almost all the ground gained
by the Midshipmen. Whether such
plays can be used with any degree
of success against Pittsburgh is a
matter for conjecture.

The present Navy squad is, on the
average, older and heavier than have
been the Annapolis teams of late
years. That fact, really, is the one
factor on which Navy depends to
take them through the tough sched-
ule remaining for the rest of the
season. Depending almost entirely
on a running attack. *Le Midshipmen
may be hopelessly outclassed tomor-
row. But the squad journeys to Pitts-
burgh determined to give all they
have in the attempt to stop the Pan-
thers and promises to make the en-
counter a real ball game.

Do you rememb er

about smoking tobacco—how it was that

After all, what you want to know

"IVas it made for that?”
Granger is made of White Burley—
the kind of leaf tobacco that’s best for

And old man W/ellman, who taught
