Lone Pitt Debate Prize

Pitt debate teams proved themselves good hosts Friday and
Saturday at the annual Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Forensic

Tourney.

Out of five contests in debate, men's oratory‘, women’s ora-
tory, and men's and women's extemporaneous speaking, the locals

managed
The lone victory went to Harry
Green, Pitt's only entry in men’s
oratory.

Allegheny College First

First place in the debates on,
“Should the US nationalize basic
non-agricultural industries?” went
to the Allegheny College team, with
Temple University pl.acing second.
The Pitt teams did not even get
into the debate semi—finals.

Pitt’s winner, Green, spoke on
the disastrous possibilities of the
Hydrogen bomb. His victory en-
ables him to enter the National In-
tercollegiate Oratory finals to be
held at Northwestern University
on April 26 and 27‘.

In the other single entry contests
Helen Spanos of Duquesne Univer-
sity took top honors in both wo-
men's oratory and women’s extem-
poraneous speaking. Emerson Pugh
of the Carnegie Institute or Tech-
nology took the laurels in the men’s
extermporaneous speaking tilt._

Gold Keys Awarded

The first place” winners were
awarded gold keys; second place
winners got silver keys, and third
place winners received bronze
keys. .

Representing Pitt in the tourney
were a men's team made up ofGreen,
Saul Davis, Bernard McGowan and
Fred Purdy.

The women’s team included Doris
Lyda, Hope Karnavas, Dorothy
Gessner and Marie Homisak. Davis
and Miss Gessner participated in
the extemporaneous speaking con-
tests.

The tournament consisted of three
rounds of debate, and all-tourney
dinner, and the oratorical and ex-
temporaneous speaking contest on
Friday.

Indeceny

Indecent literature "on drug-
store counters throughout the na-
tion” is the target of a crusade by
the National Federation of New-
man Clubs.

Donald Duffy, national president,
announced the start of the cam-
paign last week in newspaper re-
leases and a telegram to the U.S.
Postmaster Gener..l. He protested
the use of the mails by indecent
‘magazines and asked for a crack-
down. '
Officers of the Pitt Newman Club
have received no definite plan of
action against indecent publica-
tions from national headquarters.

George Hughes, president of the‘
Pitt chapter, says that the cam-
paign was endorsed by delegates
to the September national conven-
tion. Details were to be worked
out by one of the school chapters-

Fr Queen

Senior women voted from 9 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m., Friday for the 1950
Senior Queen, in polls set up in
the first floor dean of women’s
office.

There are approximately 400 sen-
ior women in this year’s class, as
reported by E. A. Batchelder, as-
sistant registrar. Voting was rather
light, with I122 ballots cast.

The seven seniors who were
nominated at last Tuesday's Rose
Tea are: Betty Bolger, Flora Die-
mert, Martha Duffy, Mildred Egge,
Vernie Stanislaw, Pearl Tobachnik,
and Betty Jean Tobias.

Each senior girl was permitted
to cast one vote for one of the sev-
en candidates. The girl who re-
cieves the highest number of votes
will become Senior Queen. The
girl that receives the next number
of votes will bewnamed Alma Mater.

The results “will be announced
at Tap Day. Barbara Shropp Daugh-

her post to the new Queen at a cor-

Professors Quizze
On ‘Loyalty Oathg’  
Not Favored Here 

B)’ LEO MOSS
A majority of faculty members queried on the issue, "Should if
faculty members be compelled to sign non-Communist affidavits?”
were strongly opposed to affidavits as a method of weeding out
bad influences in American colleges.
A recent poll at the University of California showed that its I

faculty was against such an oath,
900-0. _ I

Dr. Carl W. Kaiser of the Pitt
economics department stated "We
should expose their views rather
than lock them up...Communists
will sign all the oaths under the
shining sun. .. .there ought to be a
better way."

However, Dr. Kaiser said that if
it ‘could be established that great
harm was being done, “I think that

normally pretty serious steps should '

be taken.”

Infringement of Freedom
Dr. Lawrence C. Little, professor
of education, was against the pro-
posal for another reason. He said
that it is an "infringement of aca-
demic freedom. it indicates an as-

sumption of lack of loyalty.”
Dr. John A. Nietz, professor of
education, took the stand that there

should be no need of such an affi- I
davit because universities are care- "

ful' who they “invite to become.
faculty members.”
Dr. Nietz said,
a Communist can live up to the
college ideal of open-mindedness.”

Dr.PaulH. Masoner of the School 4

of Education said that “teachers
should not be singled out as a group
to have their loyalty‘ questioned.”

. Teachers Should Swear
Albert A. Mavrinac of the politi-'
cal science department had an op-

posing view. “As federal and state ‘

officers have to, I see no reason
why teachers shouldn't have to

swear to and uphold the constitu- 

Dr. Denton Beal of the English I

department was opposed to such an
oath both personally and as a mem-
ber of the American Association
of University Professors which has
taken an official stand against it.
Dr. Beal added that if the person
is a good teacher, "I don't particu-
larly care what his politics are.”

Up to Students
A different opinion was held by
Albert W. Bendig of the Psychology

department. He said, “«It’s up to,

the students to decide whether the
teachers should sign.”

Dr. Bela Gold, professor of Econ-U.‘

omics, was the least commital of

the faculty contacted. He said that 
anyone who would comment on any- .

thing he knew so little about was
a “stupid person.”

i»The old Refrain '

During the past year the News has, from time to time, been

 the target for critical shafts aimed by disgruntled members of

Student Congress. Some of the criticism has been justified; most

V of it has been far out of line.

A prime example of the latter type came up a week ago when

Congress’ poll committee chairman, Henry Conner, blamed the.

News for the overwhelming rejection of a polled proposal to pro-
vide free time for activities inithe middle of each class day. Con-
ner claimed that the News’ handling of the poll tended to bias

student opinion on the subject. *1

an 1: an =1: :1: =1: _
He cited the story which appeared with the questionnaire
form and an editorial on the subject to back up his claim, adding

that the reference to the proposal as the ‘Rush plan’ f‘didn’t help

it any.”

The story in question was a simple statement of the proposal
and Congress’, reasons for polling the student body on it. The
News printed the questionnaire at Conner’s request.

The editorial referred to merely stated the pros and cons on

A ;_,the subject. If anything, it leaned toward endorsementpof the plan.

_ As for the contention that attaching the name ,of the dean of
women to the plan she proposed doomed it to defeat, we don’t
consider such a charge worth consideration.

*** =e=** ,
The poll chairman might do well to study his own polling

gtechnique. His mentor, Dr. Ralph Jensen of the psychology de-

partment, would be the first to point out that a poll based upon

a the voluntary return of mass-distributed questionnaires has ex-

tremely poor validity. Such a method rarely brings forth returns
from any but those who are ardently for or violently against the

subject polled, with the latter group greatly predominating,
7regardless of the true general feeling on the question. I’

The only advantage to the method used by Conner is that it

‘saves the pollster from the work of getting the interview answers
 on which professional public opinion analysts bape their find-

ings.
*** *** ,
It seems that Conner has followed the example of others who
have found the News a convenient scapegoat on which to hang
their own errors. In this case the action is all the more indefens-

-ible in that the News granted Conner’s request for space, placing

2.‘

his questionnaire in the best possible position short of Page 1
in its editorial make-up. Our advertisers pay to have their quest-
ionnaires run in much pooreriadvertising space.

We’d like to see the same poll taken under the proper ‘method.
The plan might still be defeated, but the ratio would be closer to

I .60-40 than 96-4.

I see where seven high-class fillies are vying for the title of
Senior Queen. The gal who comes out second best is christened
"Alma Mater.” This is all well and good, so far.

The hitch is that the lucky seven were chosen because they
represent the,"highest attainments in scholarship, leadership,

character, and service” among the
senior women.

Not one word, mind you, about
whether these prospective queens“
have knock-knees or a shape that
would disturb an absent minded pro-
fessor’s reverie s. No measurements,
no bathing-suits--just character,
scholarship, and leadership.

This is bad. Who ever heard of a
campus queen who would make
cheesecake revert to its original
meaning'— food? A queen whose qual-

 

ifications are measured by a point
scale instead of a bathroom scale?

The‘ whole system should be‘

changed. Tradition is fine, except
when it makes an eye-filling queen
a coincidence. I say measure the
queen's merits by what the tape
measure reads when applied to cer-
tain points and leave the intellec-
tual part to Alma Mammy. She’s
more the type.

I'M BEGINNING to wonder just
when certain people park their cars
around the Cathedral. From a per-
sonal survey it seems that some

sort of a schedule is in operation.
If youwcome in before 7 a.m., you

can have a choice legal spot on
Bigelow near the Cathedral. At
7:15’ a.m. you can have almost the
same location plus a distinctive
yellow‘ line.

A 7:20 arrival places you on
Bigelow near Syria Mosque; at 7:30
a.m. and until 8 a.m., you may still
get a place in the Schenley Park

 

lot. After 8 a.m. you cruise around
and wait for someone to leave. If
you don’t get in till after 8:30, you
can either take a spot near Trees

I Gym or'go back home.

And if you think you see a spot
near school after 8:30, don’: pull
in. There’s a .wee little car hidden
between those two long jobs.

Perhaps we should all drive mid-

Mr. Milo Ponte,
Exchange Editor

In the interest of accuracy I feel
obliged to call to your attention
the article under your name which
appeared in the March Seventh edi-
tion of the Pit: News.

The item in point is the one con-

-cerning the undergraduate‘ drinking
-society at ComellUniversity which
had its initiation ceremonies come
to such an abrupt and infamous end
in the super-saturation of one of
the prospective members. Your
source of information is undoubted-
ly the Cornell Daily Sun, a news-
paper wirhout peer in the field of
collegiate journalistic endeavor,

* but the facts as you report themare
so blatantly in error as to bring me
to presume that either you or that
great sheet have made a serious
mistake.

First, the name of the drinking
society (and ‘I compliment you on
your choice of words in this respect
—for the_ organizations are not
Greek-letter fraternities in the pop-
ular sense) is undoubtedly one or
the other, but not both MUMMY and
MAJURA. If the asipirant was a
member of a class graduatingin an
even-numbered year, it was The
Mummy Club (or, more correctly,
Beth L’Amed.\‘ If, however, the un-
fortunate was a member of a class
graduating in an odd-numbered year
it was then the second cousin
Majura. 7 '

More important, though, was the
unfortunate impression given by
your article that Cornellians are.
pikers when it comes to things
liquid. You yourself, Mr. Ponte,

martinis in an hour and a half is a
mere nothing. The custom is—and
I feel sure that the facts will bear
me out—that the new member drink
that quantity of the chosen bever-
age AT ONE DRAUGIIT.

It is, Mr. Ponte, the time honored
folk-way so quaintly referred to as
‘chug-a-lug’, with which you are
undoubtedly familiar.

I also feel obliged to add to your
account of the injuries sustained
the fact that a. good part of the
damage was done when, having
finished his sip, the unlucky neo-
phyte promptly lost consciousness
and hit his head in doing so. Ex-
cess of alcohol in the blood; un-
consciousness; these indeed, but
also lacerations and contusions.

This, then, for your information,
the more nearly accurate account
of an unfortunate clay.

Thank-you Note
Editor,
Pitt News

I have no way of thanking some-
one for recovering, and handing in
to the lost-and-found department,
a text I recently lost. This doesn’t
often happen in other schools I
have attended.

After talking with the above

'mentioned department head, I found

that many articles are returned here
at Pitt. This commendable spirit
should be fostered. Perhaps if you
would thank these honest people
for us, they would realize that there
are many students, like myself,
who deeply appreciate their kind-
ness.

MACHINES TAKE OVER--Jack McCloskey, a worker in he is-
trar's office, watches as cards are automatically alphabetized_. They are
whizzing through the machines at the rate of 400 per minute.

***

Automatic Machines Aid
Registration Process

By LEN BAKER

Over 240,000 cards are alphabetized bythe Registrar's Office
after each registration in approximately 5900 minutes.

That is something of a record. S

The process is completely mechanical and the machines run
about 400 cards through a minute. The large number of cards is

a result of approximately twelve
offices requesting a card for each
of the 20,000 students at Pitt.

Since t-he cards are alphabetized
by holes punched in them, each
card must be run through six times
making a total of over one and
one-half million times.

Master File Number Used

Each student has_a six digit
number. This number is taken from
the student’s position in the mas-
ter file book. The pages in this
book are numbered from 0001 to
6202 with numbers running from
00‘ to 99 on each page. The first
four digits of the student’s num-
ber are taken from ‘his page number
and the last two from his position
on the page.

When the student enters Pitt
a master statistical card is made
for him. This card has holes
punched in it-corresponding to the
student’s number. If his number
is 355546, then the third square
in the first row is punched, the
fifth square in the second row,
and so on.

Then each of the student's
twelve cards which are to be al-
phabetized are placed behind this
master card and put in the machine.

Intricate Separation

The next step is to take all
the cards and mechanically sepa-
rate them according to the num-
bers in the first row, then the
second row, and continuing until
the cards have been run through
six times. I

The master » statistical card
also has material punched on it
so that the students can be sepa-
according
to maritalwstatus, position inhigh
schoolgraduating class, and num-
erous other characteristics which
the Registrar's Office often has
to supply.

Alum Party
Scheduled

All senior girls are invited as
guests to the annual Alumni Spring
Dessert festivities‘ in the Commons.

In previous years the seniors
were first introduced to the Alumni
at a Sunset Dinner just before grad-
uation. Since senior activities at
that time were so heavy, the din-
ner was not as successful as it
might have been. ,

As a result this year Mrs_. Paul
B. Kohberger, president of the asso-
ciation, decided to hold a party for
the seniors early in the spring
semester. _

Katherine G. Blyley, president
.of New York’s Keuka College, will
be the principal speaker and guest
at the annual reunion meeting. Dr.
Blyley earned her Ph.D. degree at
the University in the department of
English.

She is the author of Keuka Col-
lege’s program “Education for So-
cial Responsibilities,” and a prom-
inent member of the College Coun-
cil of the New York State Board of
Regents.

The Saturday party will begin
with light refreshments in the Com-
mons Room. The group will then
move to the Stephen Foster Memor-
ial where the chairmen will present
their annual reports. Mrs. Kohberger
will explain seniors’ affiliation
with the Alumnae Association.

Dean Meets
Parents

Parents of senior women will get
oriented to the life of college sen-
iors at the annual Parents Forum,
Tuesday, March 21, at 8 p.m., in
Stephen Foster Memorial.

Dean Helen P. Rush will speak
to the parents in an attempt to make
them aware of the change their
daughters are about to make. Dean
Rush defines the senior year as
"an orientation period to new ex-

She further explains that gradu-
ation, after sixteen years of school,
brings about a change that is not
always understood by parents.

The discussion will include the
subject of job-hunting, extra gradu-
ation expenditures, and vocational
adjustment. Parents will be given
information on the Placement Bureau
and opportunities for graduates.
Dean Rush will also remind the
parents not to rush seniors into
finding a job.

ICG Sends Twenty-Five

Delegates to Convention

Pitt’s «Intercollegiate Conference
on Government will send‘ twenty-
five delegates to a "model" con-
stitutional convention at Harris-
burg, April 13 to 16, Ray Maher,
member of the group, said recently.

At the state meeting, the Pitt
students together with hundreds of
other state college students will
attempt to compose a workable,
efficient, "model” constitution for
Pennsylvania.

The student assembly is spon-
sored by the Pennsylvania ICG as
a means “whereby students may
learn together how their government
operates.”

These meetings have been held
at Harrisburg since 1934. They
have taken various forms in the
past. These‘ included modelstate
and national legislatures, gover-
nor's conferences,‘ and national
political conventions.

Pitt has always taken an active
part in this project. Two years I

 

ago, a Pitt student, Russell Shel-

Selection of the University's
delegates will be held the week
prior to the convention's opening.
In the meantime, the Pitt ICG is

Law Students Hear

New York

"Law is the framework of

Counsel

democracy, and lawyers are re-

sponsible for maintenance of that framework,” declared Harold J.
Gallagher, American Bar Association president, in an address at
the annual banquet of the Pitt StudentBar Association last Thurs-

day night.

The New York counsel added
that qualities of justice can reach
no higher than the ideals of law-
yers.

"The right to practice law will
continue only as long as public
service remains the guiding light
of the profession,” he asserted.

Referring to the Student Bar As-
sociation, of which Pitt student,
Richard J. Flickinger, is the first
national president, Mr. Gallagher
said the four-year-old organization
will have far reaching effects on
the profession. ,

The Student Bar Association is
made up of students in 63 law
schools. Its purpose is to teach

prospective lawyers the ethics of

the ABA.

Mr. Gallagher also said that, in
his opinion, "The United States
is a republic of law, not of men.”

Regarding the major precept of
the ABA, promoting the judicial
welfare of society, Mr. Gallagher

proclaim ed a need forgreater under-
standing between lawyers and‘ lay-
men.

“The attorney is lubrication for
society’s machinery, and is con-
tion.” he said. The future of the
profession depends on young law
graduates-, according to Mr. Galla-
gher.

the team and what the team can ex-
pect from the coaching staff.

"Loyalty, hard work, and coop-

Cas said, "and we expect the same

Cas also told the team that he
wants "determination, drive, and

"We are playing the best,” he
continued. ‘'Let’s be the best.”

Frank in a Coca-Cola plant.

Commission Offered

Still another instituti'on south of
the Mason-Dixon Line tried to win
him with talk of a U.S. Army com-
mission awarded on completion of
a four-year military course.

An offer to take care of Frank’s
family including a home for them,
plus paying his tuition fees was
extended Nassida by another scout.
A Big Ten university promised him
a job in theF.isher Body Company.

Nassida finally decided to go to
Pitt when it looked like Len Cas-
anova would become the new head
football coach. Frank played the
“T” for four years at Duquesne
High under Coach John Donelli and
thinks that it is the best system in
football today. I

Played Three Positions

Although Frank played left half-
back and center for Duquesne High,
he received most of his plaudits
for his work at the fullback post.

Incidentally, Frank thinks Cas

is great after meeting him for the
first time Thursday.

Should Be Settled Soon

By DAVE POLLOCK
Seating arrangements for Pitt’s new field house have hit a

snag in City Council. But the

difficulties are expected to be

settled this week so that construction may be resumed sometime

in April.

Council’s Board of Appeals is slated this week to hear the
University's plea to alter an ordinance covering the amount of
persons allowed in the field house per exit.

In non-theater types of buildings, 67 people are allowed per
exit, and the blueprints for the sports center calls for 90 persons
per exit. Pitt’s architects report that there is no ordinance apply-

ing directly to buildings like the
field house.

Cost 21 Mystery

A quick understanding is expect-
ed by the University and the
final plans may be drawn up im-
mediately to complete the job that
was interrupted during last sum-
mer's building strike and was never
continued.

Just how much the structure will
cost and how many fans it will hold
remains a mystery. ’

It was previously reported that
7000 seats would be placed in a
$1,350,000 field house, but Frank

Carver, ..graduate manager of ath-

letics, reveals that the cost is ex->

pected to be smaller and that the
exact number of seats has not been
determined as yet.

Stuck with Cement

Blueprints for the building have
already been changed once, but the
University is now stuck with a
foundation to which the new plans
must conform, or else Doc Carl-
son’s “figure eight” offense will
wind up snarled in a traffic jam in
the parking lot.

The field house, above the Stad-
ium, is being built to alleviate the
poor conditioning space that is now
provided for Panther athletes in
various sports. The physical edu-
cation department will also receive
some valuable space.

As Dr. Carlson has already point.

ed out, Pitt will be able to invite
many of the strongest hoop teams
in the nation to its basketball pal-
ace when it is completed.

Len Casanova could not have made a better choice for junior
varsitycoach than Don Fisher. Even though Fisher had had no ex-
perience with Pitt’s new T-formation, he still fits the job to a T.

The boys who go out for jayvee football do not do so to get a

ride through college. There
‘(are no promises of scholarships or

J motion to the varsity. _

so in went the fair virgin.

Naturally, the story would not

Fisher was not outstanding merely

A new narrator, but the same old

story.
Another independent league
squad, this season the Dazzling

Dukes, has copped the all-campus
basketball crown. The honors came
on the strength of a decisive 43-33
Duke victory over the fraternity
league peers, the Phi Ep Peps, at
the Trees court Friday.

The Phi Eps, who never led in
the tussle, fell apart after Duke
Andy Brinsko broke a first quarter
deadlock with three
shots from the foul circle early in.
the second period.

Eps Rallied -

However, the fourth quarter be-
gan with Phi Ep Herb Schultz lead-
ing his mates in a rally which nar-
rowed the count to 34-32. Ronald
Weinstein, whose 14 points labeled
him high scorer‘, squelched the Phi
Ep drive by playing outstanding de-
fensive ball at this point.

Andy Moranz was the spark plug
of the Duke drive that ended with
the final whistle and a ten point
margin of victory.

Dukes Fast

Speed and more consistent ball
playing were the virtues of the
Duke’s overwhelming victory. The
Phi Eps were sluggish throughout
most of the contest. ‘

The next major step for the Dukes
will be the all-Oakland game to be
played with Carengie Tech’s IM
champs. Tech’s\play-offs are being
run off this week.

Coed Talks

Successful

Last week’s vocational guidance
conferences for women, according
to Mrs. J.W. Findley, assistant to
the dean of women, “were very
successful in content.”

She added that the conference
lectures, both outside and faculty
speakers, were pleased by the stu-
dent response.

'‘However,’’ she added, “more
students could take advantage of
the 15 conferences if they were not
concentrated in a single week.”
For this reason, a year-round pro-
gram of two vocational conferences
3. month for coeds may be decided
upon for next year.

A talk on "Choice of Vocation,”
by George A. Palmer, personnel
director of Joseph Horne’s, con-
cluded last week’s conferences.

Among vocations discussed by
last week’s speakers were soiiial
work, laboratory technician, and
merchandising.

By using the Link trainer tucked
away in locker room two, air navi-
gation students can practice flying
a plane without taking the long
trip to the airport.

The Link gives students practi-
cal experience in instrument flying,
such as the takeoff, turns, spins
and even barrel rolls, which the
instruments indicate, plus the
altitude and speed of the plane.

The trainer is a box-like con-
traption with two parts, the upper
half looking like an airplane, hav-
ing short wings, a tail, and acocl<-

The lower half contains the mech-
anism that rotates and tilts the
plane. Only a qualified instructor
can operate it.

There are only fifteen students
taking the air navigationcourse
now. Their instructor, Joseph Ka-
chun of the mathematics department,
said that they use the Link trainer
only to see what airplane instru-
ments look like and how they are
used. ‘

Although he is not qualified to
run the Link, Kachun said that
people are often asking him to let
them use it. Surprisingly, he added,
those who ask him are usually ad-
vanced fliers and not beginners.

This relic of Pitt's wartime avia-
tion training program will soon be
dismantled and stored away, ac-
cording to Dr. James S. Taylor,
head of the mathematics depart-
ment.

Party Planned

The party will be sponsored by
the customs committee of WSGA.
The women who did outstanding

field to find his body.

The course of action leading up to this tragic cli-
max concerns a conspiracy led by Brutus to kill Cae-
sar, the ruler of Rome. Brutus, Caesar’s best friend,
lS‘COnVlf1Ce(l that Caesar is a~-«tryant and should be

eliminated from the Roman scene.

Shakespeare shows how Caesar has made
enemies~in Rome until finally the tribunes in the city
band together behind Brutus to murder him. The auth-
or's theme is built around the minds and motives of

Caesar’s murderers.

The Players’ costumes are Elizabethan in style
rather than Roman, as is customary in the production

of "Caesar.”

“Caesar” is the third production of the Players’

season.

two parts. Caesar will be repre-
sented by the right side and Brutus
by the left. Four columns will be
placed on the stage and their posi-
tion will indicate the side in po-
wer. When Caesar is in power, th e
columns will be on his side, and
as Brutus gains control, they will
be moved to his side.

The cast will wear Elizabethan
costumes rather than Roman dress.
Thistis because there are many
mentions of Elizabethan dress in
play, and Shakespeare’s players
dressed in that fashion.

There will be 18 scene changes
involving simple sets, with only
one intermission.

The number of characters has
been cut to about a third of the
original number. The cast includes
only three women, one of whom
plays a young boy whose voice
has not yet changed.

Caesar will be played by Jack
Ingrim. Dick Costanza will take
the part of Brutus. Cassius will be
acted by Mel Silver and Jack
Schano will portray Mark Antony.
Ben Tatar will play Casca.

The three women in the play,
Elaine Teifield, Diane Dimon, and
Gloria Brodie, will play Portia,
Calpurnia, and Lucius, the young
boy.

The week after the performances
at Pitt, the Players will take
"Caesar” on a road tour to Brent-

vwood, Etna, Braddock, and other
outlying neighborhoods.

Vin Ross, curator of medieval and
subsequent decorative art, and a
demonstration by Cantini on the
history of enameling marked the
opening of an exhibit of some of
his and his wife’s work.

Mr. Cantini, a quiet, well manner-
ed, stocky man received his bache-
lor of arts degree atCarnegie Tech.

It ‘was at Tech where he became
interested in enameling, and also
met his wife. Lucille Cantini is
a good artist in her own right, and
much of their work is done to-
gether.

During the war, he made models
of various terrains for invasion
purposes. Lucille was a teacher
and supervisor of art in East Mc-
Keesport schools.

Making beautiful pieces of jewelry
and other decorative objects by
this medieval craft is not the only
thing that the Cantinis are skilled
in. The couple has also achieved
fame in ceramics, metal and jewelry
work, and oil paintings and water-
