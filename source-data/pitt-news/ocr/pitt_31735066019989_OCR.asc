Sigma Alpha Mu shares experience

By Stacey Carlitz
For’ The Pitt News

Assistant News Editor

A group of fraternity brothers who
built their chapter from the ground up
are offering their assistance to the
founding fathers of Pitt's chapter of
Zeta Beta Tau. They hope the ex-
perience they gained can serve as an
example to ZBT.

When the brothers of Pitt's Sigma
Alpha Mu fraternity learned of plans
to begin a ZBT chapter here, they
were quick to share the story of their
struggles in hopesof making the long
road to chartering an easier journey
for the reorganizing frat.

”They’re going to be faced with a
lot of things they're not aware of yet,”
said Ron Ball, president of Sigma
Alpha Mu. ”You have to go through
a lot of red tape with the university.”

”We know first-hand what it's like
because we did it and we did it suc-
cessfully. We want to help them
out," said SAMMY founder Adam
Plotkin.

Plotkin and Ball, together with Jerry
Goldberg and less than a handful of
prospective brothers, began resurrec-
tion of Pitt's chapter of SAMMY,
which was discontinued in 1970 after
over 50 years in existence.

”The university was not supportive
because they felt that Sigma Alpha
Mu had tried to reorganize four times
before, and why were‘ we any dif-
ferent?” said Plotkin.

Students had tried to restart SAM-

MY in 1979, 1980, 1981 and again
in 1982, he explained. Each time,
their efforts fell short of initiation in-
to the national fraternity.

Interest in starting a new fraternity
sprang from the fact that the members
of the colony, as groups interested in

becoming a chapter are called, did

not feel interested in joining any of
the existing frats. They tried to instill
in SAMMY their own strong concern
for academics, as well as a strict anti-
hazing policy. «

”My best friend was killed in

fraternity, so when I came here I was
very anti-fraternity,” said Plotkin.
”We don't believe in any form of
hazing. That's an absolute no.”
, Twenty-tvvo months after the for-
mation of the original eight-member
colony, 25 young men were initiated
into the Sigma Alpha Mu national
fraternity. "

”We got a lot of help from the
other frats,” co-founder Goldman
said of the reorganization project.
”We also found out that our alumni
in this area was very strong. We have
very supportive alumni.”

In the three years since SAMMY
received its national charter, its
membership has more than doubled,

according to Bail.

Minority groups -

portunity for the black students to
identify with the other people at the
university."

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer » ’

A drastic decrease in the number
of eligible black high school
graduates has occurred in the past
few years in Pennsylvania, reducing
the pool of available college students.
This drop has caused black action
groups at both" Pitt and Penn State to
try to get the administrations to be
more aware of the needs of black
students already enrolled.

The Black Student Coalition
Against Racism was formed at Penn
State last year to increase the
awareness of the problems of black
students and to encourage divest-
ment of university funds from South
Africa. Daryl King, the president of
Penn State's Black Caucus and a
member of BSCAR, said, ”There is a
considerable problem in the recruit-
ment and retention of black students
here. The university is unable to pro-
vide an atmosphere conducive to
their specific needs."

The problems that King cites at 1,
Penn State also emphasize the issue
of a poor atmosphere at that school 
for the black students. ”The main’
problem here is not so much. in the ‘
admissions of the new black students,
but in the retention of those students-
after the second year.

”There is a lack of adequate 
counseling for the blacks,” he con-- *
tinued. ”They often get bad in_forr_na- ‘
tion aboutlcareer possibilities and
end up in classes that don't do. them ._
any good.”

King said Penn Statecould increase
the black retention rates by improv- 
ing the support services for the
students.

_ ”We might bring in 500 new black
students, but if only 89 graduate, the
recruitment efforts haven't done
anything for us,” King said. ”Our
Pitt has 6.);-pé.ri.e-hced sivrﬁiaf prO_ organizations are here to reta,i,n_,th.e. .  '9
blems in recent years, and according black Students who are here’ '
to Don Frazier, a member of Pitt's
Black Action Society, the reasons are
also similar. The BAS was formed to
take care of the political, educational
and entertainment needs of the black

students at Pitt.

While it has seen an increase in the
number of-administration committees
formed recently to study the problem,
he feels that very little progress has
been made. ”They' [the administra-
tion] are willing to discuss the pro-
blems, but they don't want to take
any action,” said Frazier.

”Sixty to 70 percent of the black
students who - enter Pitt do not
graduate," Frazier said in a telephone
interview. ”Often, there are only one
or two black students in a class of
300. It makes the situation very hard
for the black students.”

He went on to say that the number
of black faculty members was very
low in proportion to the number of
whites. ”There’s not really much op-

Adequate counseling seems to be t
a problem at Pitt as well. Barbara . .
Sizemore, from Pitt's Department of ‘
[Black Studies said, ”The Pitt ad-
ministration is ashamed of the
dropout rate here. They claim they
don't have the information even
though we've been asking for it for
two years.

”The [counseling] supportsystem
simply does not exist,” she con-
tinued. ”The students with problems
are not able to get the help they need."
We have a critical problem here, an_d
it's not being addressed with the
kinds of strategies that will work. The
university often says one thing and
then behaves another way.” "

She also said that increased
cooperation between Pitt officials and
the action groups is needed.

 
 

 

’’In two years, the administration , .
has not gotten the data we need.
They must not think it's an important
problem.” ‘

 

”We’re a lot tighter group than
some of the other frats. We have 50
members but we're all still best
friends,” Ball said.

The SAMMY brothers claimed that
rush turnout has been excellent and
that the dry rush policy has affected
them very little.

‘'1 like it. I like it a lot,” Ball said
of the new policy. "It's a lot easier
to get to know the guys. If there
weren't so much publicity about it,
a lot of the freshmen wouldn't know
the difference.”

Goldberg expressed a matter-of-fact
attitude about the policy. ”We look
at it on the level that if there were
alcohol [allowed], we'd have wet par-
ties; but there's not, so we have dry
parties,” he said. '

Ball clarified, ”We don't necessari-
ly agree with the way it [the decision
to implement dry rush] came about.”

CAIRO, Egypt —- For the first time in
five years, Israel and Egypt are sitting
down for peace talks. Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres arrived in
Alexandria, about 130 miles north of
Cairo, to meet with Egyptian Presi-
dent Hosni Mubarak. Peres said he
hopes the talks can end the ’’cold
peace” between the two countries.
The meeting took place after an
American Middle East envoy, Richard
Murphy, helped the two sides agree
on how to end a border dispute over
a 700-yard stretch of beach known as
Taba. Meanwhile, back in Israel,
Peres’ meeting with Mubarak is draw-

ing criticism from Israeli Foreign

Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who said
the meeting will only cause more ter~
rorist attacks on Israelis by radical
Arab groups. Shamir is slated to trade
posts with Peres Oct. 14 as part of an
agreement arranged by the coalition
government.

Japanese leader
to stay in office

TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone was granted another year
in office Thursday by the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party. The un-
precedented move culminated near-
ly a year of maneuvering by

Nakasone, who has sought to have
an extension of his two-year term as
president. Nakasone had been slated
to step down as-‘president Oct. 31.

Chilean leader seeks
broader powers

SANTIAGO, Chile — President
Augusto Pinochet, who narrowly sur-
vived an assassination attempt last
week, said Thursday that he wants
broader powers to fight terrorists, and
promised to set a date for a vote on
such a proposal. But the National
Union oflournalists and the opposi-
tion Christian Democratic Party said
they are vehemently opposed to such
measures and criticized Pinochet for
declaring a nationwide state of siege
following the assassination attempt.
According to the CDR, the declara-
tion has given rise to death squads,
which they blame for at least three
killings. Pinochet told reporters
Thursday that a voter referendum on
sweeping new powers would be held
as soon as a new voter registration List
could be compiled. The previous list
of eligible voters was burned. by
Pinochet when he took power in a
military coup 13 years ago. NUJ

Malaysia says ”no”
to heavy metal rock

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -— The
Malaysian government Thursday
eased a ban on outdoor rock con-
certs, but said it still will not allow
”heavy metal” rock concerts because
that kind of music ”is apt to make
youths become hysterical and act
unbecomingly.” Culture, Youth and
Sports Minister Abdul Najib Razak
Thursday described heavy metal
music as anti-social and a form of
”satanic escapism” that induces
listeners to perform masochistic acts,
such as cutting various parts of their
bodies -and drawing blood. The
government had outlawed all out-
door rock concerts Monday after
chaos broke out at a ’’battle of the

some 4,000 spectators began hurling
soft drink cans and chairs. But Thurs-
day the government changed its mind
and agreed to allow all but heavy
metal performances. Najib noted that
heavy metal music is popular among
Moslem Malaysian youths, who like
to dress in leather studded armlets,
tight jeans and T-shirts bearing the
names of groups.

NRC lab facilities

By Dirk Kaufman

Managing Editor

The applied research depart-
ment has joined the competition
for a major research laboratory ex-
pected to be established by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The NRC has not yet given final
approval for the project.

Pitt has solicited the help of
Ohio State and West Virginia
University to help acquire the
project.

”We’re very happy to be work-
ing with other universities and
corporations. It's something Dr.
Posvar has been seeking for a long
time,” said Samuel A. Schulhof,
associate vice president for ap-
plied research.

Schulhof said the center would
be established at Pitt's Applied
Research Center in Harmarville.

Though this would be the primary
location, he said research would '
also be performed at OSU, WVU
and Pitt.

Penn State and the University of . 
Arizona are among the other ‘ "

schools and corporations com-
peting for_ the project. .

The center is expected to
receive approximately $20

million in funding per year, 

according to Schulhof.

’’It’s not like a traditional
research project because it has
longevity,” said Schulhof. ”We’re

_ looking at a 20-year project.” f i_.,.
Schulhofsaid the center would - I -‘

be funded by the NRC in five-year
increments and that a change in
location would be unlikely after
the study was begun.

According to Schulhof, the ap-
plied research department expects

the NRC to request proposals on F T‘

or near Oct. 15.

The Jar Wars —
 When will it end?

.  Since the dawn of our great democracy, politicians have tried to
: find new and exciting ways to outdo one another come election time.
 We've seen them do everything from kissing babies to milking cows,
"all attempts to prove to the voters that they are capable of holding
 office and are willing to do anything to win an election. Thanks to
I -the current national paranoia regarding drug abuse, campaign '86
» has brought forth what could very well be the most ridiculous vote-
lxwinning scheme to date — urine sample comparisons.

Q A To date, this tactic has been used by only a handful of desperate
-V men who are running for office. They're trying to hold themselves
  up as role models for today's troubled and misguided youth and to
 prove, once and for all, that they are "moral|y fit” to hold an office.
2.

I

 .v The aspiring office-seekers who resort to such tactics can't seem to
‘l see that voters aren't as gullible as they think they are. It's obvious
‘that touting a "clean" specimen cup does nothing but swell egos.
While this inane practice is by no means common, there are races
Cacross the country where it has become popular. Georgia's
 Democratic primary is a good example. A candidate for a seat in Con-
 gress suggested the test to his seven competitors. Five of them agreed,
 and their specimens were found to be free of illicit drugs. One of
if the two gentlemen who refused to take the test called the practice
-;"’Jar Wars;" he also lost the primary. Jar Wars have also cropped up
 ‘ in races in Wisconsin and California. One candidate from California
‘ , took his test in the middle of a press conference, in full view of
 ‘freporters. He was met with little enthusiasm, but he defended his
 actions by saying "Now nobody can say I switched it [the specimen]
,_with somebody else.” Where will it stop?
 ‘ ' These tests are strictly on a voluntary basis, for now. The only peo-
‘ .ple who would agree to an optional test are those whose systems
‘..t.-,_.‘are free from controlled substances. Those who decline are either
conscientiously opposed or have been using some extra—curricular
-.  _chemicals. Whichever the case, those who decline are open to suspi-
‘  cion. Do they or don't they use drugs? In the case of the congres-
' sional candidate from Georgia who declined, the suspicions generated
 from his decision could very well have cost him the election. The
 people who pass one of these tests and use the results to better their
‘_,chances in an election should count their lucky stars that no one has
vdeveloped a laboratory procedure to gauge their respective vices
. -_which are out of public view, where they should stay.
 The practice of drug testing is growing. More and more professions
:  are making such tests mandatory, the rationale being that illegal drug
  . use decreases productivity. That may be the case, but legal drugs don't
  increase productivity either. Is somebody who smokes a joint every
.  night after work less productive than another person who drinks
 himself into oblivion every day after 5 p.m.? .
’j The percentage of people who use illegal drugs in this country is
 staggering. Keep in mind that they are only estimates — the real
A numbers are probably unfathomable. The reason that these numbers
‘ *' are so hard to believe is that people who use drugs on occasion don't
’ act any differently from those who don't use any at all. That's not
V to say that some illegal drugs aren't dangerous; they are. But are they
1..  any more dangerous than some legal drugs, namely tobacco and
 _galcohol?
? _ Right now, drug tests are mandatory for only a few professions.
 Will it stop with those few, or will it go beyond athletes and air traf-
fic controllers to include everyone? It's conceivable that someday drug
v tests will be as necessary as SAT scores on college admission applica-
tions, as important as references on a resume and as vital as a gray
suit in an interview. Drug tests are a blatant invasion of privacy, and
unless steps are taken now, Orwell’s vision of a futuristic society in
7984 may become reality in 1986. It may be a fad. It may be just
another way for desperate politicians to outdo one another. But then
again, it may be a sign of things to come.
The story of the gentleman from California who took his test in
— public is humorous, at least on the surface, but upon further inspec-
tion, one can see that Big Brother may be watching us after all.

This last week, City Council sent an
official request on council stationery
asking the Fulton Theatre not to show
a French movie called Hail Mary, by
the renowned director Jean-Luc
Godard, in Pittsburgh. What, you
may ask, was so terrible about this
movie to earn it the distinction of be-
ing the only film council has tried to
stop from coming here? There is
cruel, exploitative pornography
downtown everyday." There are
senseless, emotionally damaging
films in our main moviehouses, like
Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, yet

none of these rate letters from coun-

cil. No, these Catholic members of
City Council tried to ban the film
because the Pope said it was

sacrilegious, and it defamed the-
’’Catholic Religion.” Is it possible that '

the abuse of women or the desen-
sitization and cold violence sold to
children on film are somehow not
subjects that the Catholic Church
should try to take a stand on — to ban
these films? Forget for a moment that
none of the good Catholics of City
Council even saw the movie they
voted on. If the pope told you to
jump off a cliff, would you do it? Of
course you would, because of an
amazing concept called the infaIIibi|i-
ty of the Church, where the Pope
speaks as ifdirectly from God. Well,
I went to see the movie. It was one
of those usual crazy French new-
wave films. It was very interesting to
watch, but although I speak French,
I still didn't understand much of what
it was about. However, there was cer-
tainly nothing filthy or cruel about it.

When politicians and officials get
their hands on religion, it is one of
the ugliest things in society. I can't
stand any formal religion. Through-
out history, more people have been
killed and tortured in the name of
religion than for any other cause. So
many religious wars, so many inquisi-
tions, persecutions, so many Kho-
meinis, Falwells and Farrakhans. I
believe in people and theirideas. I
believe in Jesus’ ideas about love,
and Ghandi and Martin Luther King's
teachings of peacefulness. I believe
in literature and art: the Bible is a
good book, Hail Mary is a good
movie. It's amazing that so many
people could have such a bizarre
belief that there is a big, magical Dad-
dy up in the sky, who is male, prob-
ably white and certainly anti—Russian.
How could we possibly have such an
absurd scene as the ridiculous foot-
washing scandal in 1986? Let's keep
religion (and all other fanaticism) out
of government and out of our laws.
Thank God Pitt is non-secular; I don't
go to the Cathedral to get religion,

ZBT

In recent weeks, a popular topic of
conversation among my friends and

me has been the creation of the ”new I

ZBT," probably because we were the
former brothers of the Phi Beta
chapter. Recently, we have been
hearing rumors concerning the
reasons why our chapter was closed
and along with the recent article
about ZBT’s re-creation, I feel that the
story needs to be corrected.

The Sept. 10 issue of The Pitt News
carried the "article of ZBT’s
reorganization. The article did hold
some truth to it, but not the whole
truth, and there were some seeming
errors. I would like to make the cor-
rection and let the truth be known.

First off, the article stated that our
former president was embezzling
money. This is not true. It was not our
president, but the president from
1984.

Many people would like to know
exactly why our chapter was
withdrawn from us. The answer is;
there are many reasons. The
embezzling of money by a former
president was one of the reasons.

Another, and from here I'll just go
right down the line, is the fact that
ZBT is recognized as a Jewish frater-
nity and at the time we only had one
active Jewish brother. We also had
the problem of lack of enthusiasm.
Nobody was willing to get involved
with the fraternal affairs, with the ex-
ception of the weekend parties.
Everyone was relying on the select
few to carry the weight of the house.
There were many various personal
differences between the brothers
which caused disagreements and a
lack of cooperation.

What we failed to understand was
that in the eyes of [the] National, the
fraternity was a business rather than
a brotherhood, and since we were
not clearing a profit (we had been
paying off the debts from previous
brothers forthe past three years) we
were considered dead weight.

I personally hold no grudges
toward the fraternity. I had some very
good times while it lasted and made

Proposition 48

The article ”Proposition 48 is a
needed rule" on the Perspective page
of The Pitt News Sept. 5, 1986, is a
classic example of waiting until the
horses get out of the stall, then yell-
ing — catch them! Of course this is
a needed rule, but it was needed
years ago. A student who is failing
every subject but continues to par-
ticipate in athletics because he is
making a college number one and

putting a coach in the limelight never .

should have been permitted [to at-
tend college] in the first place. I am
in complete agreement with the sec-

tion of the article that stated ”with

most of the blame resting on the col-
|eges." I think it is an absolute
disgrace that these colleges and
universities have used these young
athletes to increase the prestige of the
institution and have given little or no
regard to the athletes’ educations.

I totally disagree with the state-
ment, "Proposition 48 has cost many
college athletic teams prime
freshmen recruits." This is the whole
problem — athletic talent has taken
priority over scholastic ability. Pro-
position 48 doesn't cost these col-
leges a thing. It is, however, a rule
that may let students know that sub-
ject matter is just as important as
athletic participation.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September l2, I986

Ex-boyfriend goes in and out of my life

Q. I told my old boyfriend to take
care of his life and let me get on with
mine. I can't deal with sharing him
with his first girlfriend, and he can't
really leave her because she has a
fatal illness. Igrasp his dilemma but
can't live with sharing him. Since he
has learned that I have a new guy —
more fun, though not such a serious
love — he can't leave me alone.
Phone calls night and day. I'm
desperate.

A. This is a painful query to this col-
umn. You have to change your
phone number. Whatever transpires,
you have to have peace of mind in
your living space and sleep at night.
As for the issues between you and
this man, they are too complex and
serious to answer here. You do have
to consult a professional relationship
counselor about this. I do not exclude
your seeing a clergyman.

Q. Once when I was drunk, about
a year ago, I was with a person who
was performing orally on me and I
got the idea that this person was a

Rosemary Klay, 23, an art student
who lives in the western suburbs of
Chicago, often commutes into the
city so that she can attend her art
classes.

One evening her class ended at 9
p.m., and she was hurrying to the
train station so that she could get
home and join her husband and
small child.

In the middle of a sidewalk near
the train station, Klay saw a lost-

, looking woman holding onto a cry-

ing child. The child appeared to be
around 8 years old. .

The woman was crying aloud. Sh
was sobbing that someone had just
stolen her wallet and that she had no
way to get her child home. She need-
ed money for the train. I

Klay noticed that all of the other
people on the street. were walking
right by the woman and the child,
paying them no attention.

Since Klay has been around the
Chicago area for a while, she was
aware of all the panhandlers that one
can encounter on the streets, and she
has grown accustomed to saying no
when a ragged stranger asks her for
money. She doesn't like to do it, but
her husband is a student too and

Fﬁends,

We are currently faced with an
epidemic far worse than AIDS and
more potentially devastating than
nuclear war.

Let's diagnose the malady as
”stuffed ears,” the inability to fully
use one’s sense of hearing and, more
importantly, one’s ability to listen.
Hearing is the physical ability to
sense noise, and listening is part of
the Homo sapiens’ knack to com-
municate with other hairless apes.

Last week on a warm, sunny, blue-
sky afternoon I took half an hour off
to lie down on the green grass of the
Cathedral's Lawn, close my eyes and
nap. _

Instead of gaining some Zs, though,
I began focusing on my other four
senses (you know, smell, touch, etc.)
With vision put temporarily out of
commission, (Ever notice how most
of our sensory input to Mr. Brain is
visual? Is this why Kennedy and
Reagan made the presidency? Why
MTV is so popular? Why Miami Vice
is so entrancing to watch?) I was gent-
ly overwhelmed by Oakland's many
subtle urban noises, some I had never

-transvestite and left suddenly. I

regard this as possible exposure to
AIDS. It is the only one I have ever
experienced. I am afraid to have sex
with women now for fear of spread-
ing a possible infection. -

A. Call a hospital in the nearest city
and get the AIDS hotline number and
have a talk about this. The odds are
against your having contracted AIDS,
but in.the present atmosphere any
cause for fear about this ailment
should be examined and reassurance
should be found. You are not a
hypochondriac for worrying. You are
not, of course, a homosexual because
of this isolated experience when you
were drunk.

But you are a foolish fellow to go
around getting drunk and having sex

_ with who knows who! Do take it to

heart that being drunk and feeling
sexy makes a dangerous combination
for gays and straights alike. This is an
era for caution and certainly not one
for promiscuity. *

money is tight in their household.

This woman on the sidewalk,
though  Klay saw the child burying
her head in her mother's stomach,
and it tore at her heart to think of the
two of them being abandoned on the
mean streets of the city.

Klay was just about to pass the
woman by, and then she thought of
her own small child — she knew she
couldn't do it.

So she opened her wallet and she
gave the woman $5 — all that she
was carrying with her.

The woman said, ”God bless you.
Oh, God bless you.”

Klay continued on toward the train
station. Partof her was feeling good
about what she had done. Another
part, though, was curious about
something. As soon as she had hand-
ed the woman the money, some of
the other commuters who were pass-
ing by started smiling. She could
swear that several of them giggled.

Klay rode the trainto her home and
told her husband about what had
happened. They agreed that giving
the woman the money had been the
right and honorable thing to do.

For a couple of weeks Klay walked
around feeling a kind of inner glow

noticed before.

I heard the usual roar of passing
PAT buses and the rumble of car
engines. A blaring car horn or chat-
ter from passing students occasionally
grabbed my attention along with the
scream of a Boeing flying overhead.

Yet I also heard the mechanical
hum from the cooling fan on top of
the coliseum-style building across the
street, frequent squeaks of car brakes,
soft flutters of pigeon wings flying
above and the wind rustling the
leaves in the tree over my head like
a gentle whisper -— all sounds that
had never caught my attention before
but had always been there. What a
fascinating discovery.

\

A half h\our later I left the Lawn feel-
ing relaxed and more attuned to the
people on the sidewalk and in
Oakland's urban environment, my
five senses heightened in awareness,
enriched and enlivened. I felt, as Billy
Crystal puts it, simply maaaavelous.

I wonder sometimes if we spend
too much time looking and not
enough hearing. Try this experiment:

Q. My girlfriend and I have a great
time in bed, but lately I have noticed
something that bothers me about my

- own' performance (no complaint

from her so far). I always become
erect, Iperform at length, but I don ’t
always climax or ejaculate. I know
that sometimes I find myself thinking

about business problems or other
outside pressures. What can I do?

A. Fantasize. I mean, think of
something that is sexy and arousing
for you, and keep that thought or pic-
ture in your mind through the sexual
encounter with your girlfriend. This
should crowd out those distracting
thoughts.

I hear about this problem more
often from women than from men,
and I call it the shopping list problem.
It isn't that the problem is more
female than male, but so many wom-
en have such a variety of details to
be in charge _o.f, and men are, more
often than women, keeping their
minds on one or two big issues. Even
in this liberated age, that is the
tendency.

But men, too, can have such pres-
sures as make them absent-minded
during sex. It is a function of fantasy
to help people concentrate on what
they are doing. Fantasy does not have
to be a. scenario of sexual events, but
some single image that helps sexual

concentration instead of disturbing it.

Q. I'm 18, he's 21, and I'm crazy
about him and he knows it — be-
cause I make it plain in word and
deed. Six months after I started with
him he told me he had been going
with another girl all the time. I blew
up and we broke up, then he phoned
me at 3 a.m. asking if I didn't love
him. This has become a pattern,
always ending with a wee-hourscall
and my melting and saying I do love
him. How can I go away to college
with all this on my mind?

A. Thank goodness for college.» He
may be older than you, but he is too
immature for you to be .in this strong
relationship with him. His inability to
make up his mind between you and
that other girl, that calling at 3 a.'m.,
not being able to wait until he doesn't
disturb you and probably your par-
ents — it is babyish behavior. (30

Klay approached the woman.

”Someone has stolen my wallet,”
the woman sobbed.

”Someone stole your wallet

The woman kept moaning, and the
child kept hugging.

”I just gave you money the other

one had stolen your wallet then.”

The woman seemed taken aback
only for a second or two. Then she
said to Klay, ”God bless you. God

exert extra effort to tear away from

This dead-matter visual saturation
has taken its toll on our generation.

a man who had been teaching for
nearly 40 years, who noted, ”Back

that when I lectured, three-fourths of
my class was paying attention. Now

be reluctant to offer help. Nobody
wants to be a sucker twice in a row.
And that bothers me. We get hard-
enedenough to city life, and. it's sort
of sad that something like this
hardens you even more. It makes you
get to the point that you don't believe
that anyone is truly in need. You see
a person seeking your help, and your
first thought is that the person is play-
ing you for a fool.

”The second thing I got angry
about was the child. You can blame
the woman, but you can't blame the
child. The child is being used in" this
way, and it's really cruel. Not only
is thetchild out on the street at 9
o'clock at night being made to act as

to grow up thinking that the only way
to be smart in life is to play people
for suckers.” I

The moral of this whole tale, Klay
said, has less to do with the woman
and the child than it does with Klay
herself. V

"People often complain about the
cold heart of the city," she said. ”And
I just feel sad that someday someone

versation if they truly paid attention

people who still practice the art of _

listening.

Try something. Next time you're
talking to a-friend or your parents,
think about what they are saying.
Churn their words around in your

head, and then spit out how you feel '

about them. Focus on-the person and
hold back the temptation to rattle on
about things concerning yourself.
Then see how you feel when the con.-

By Maria Ritz
Staff Writer

The University Bicentennial
Organization is planning numerous
commemorative events throughout
1987. Included among these is the
“reconstruction of a 200—year-old log
house on the Cathedral Lawn.

The location is just a few miles
from the site in downtown Pittsburgh
at Third Avenue and Cherry Way
where the Pittsburgh Academy log
house was originally built.

Mr. David Schwartz, assistant ex-

, ecutive director of the Bicentennial

Program, said, ”The cabin is being
erected to serve as a symbol of Pitt's
beginning 200 years ago.”

The historic log house is being
donated by Mr_. and Mrs. Charles A.

N0 goals allowed

Panthers
blank Cal
in opener

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther soccer team
opened its 1986 campaign with a 2-0
victory over the California State
Vulcans, Wednesday night at Pitt
Stadium.

”I am very pleased,” said Pitt
coach Joe Luxbacher. ’’It was a good
all-around effort. We made a few
mistakes, but overall I am very
pleased.”

Each team's defense held the
other’s off until about midway into
the first half, when Pitt senior Mike
Grimes put in the first goal of the
night. ”I really felt good out there
tonight, but I think the score was a
result of effort, and some luck, rather
than pure skill,” commented Grimes.
’’I think we could have played bet-
ter. Cal State is a good team; I am
glad we could pull out a win.”

The rest of the first half was rather
uneventful. Both teams played solid
defense, as neither offense could
break through. There was a bit of
confusion when the stadium clock
malfunctioned, and neither team
knew that the half had ended. At
halftime Pitt led 1-0.

When the second half started, both
teams looked as if they were trying

— to get a quick score. The first scoring

threat came when the Vulcans got the
ball in close, but Panther goalie Mark
Hendricks made a nice diving save
to keep Pitt ahead.

Then with 18 minutes left in the
game, there was a mad scramble of
players in front of the California goal.
Finally, the ball hit into the back of
the net, and Pitt sophomore Erim
Gude came away celebrating his first
goal of the season. ”It is pretty hard
to stop the other team from scoring
when the ball is bouncing around

Panthers ready for battle with N.C. State

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Good football teams don't lose
games to inferior opponents. That is
the reason a lot will be said about the
1986 Pitt Panthers after Saturday
night's game at North Carolina State.

The Panthers are playing a
Wolfpack team that appears to be an
inferior opponent. At_ least that's what
the odds-makers say. They have
made Pitt an eight-point favorite for
the game. That sure sounds like N.C.
State is inferior to the Panthers. But
if Pitt doesn't win, then that should
give everyone a better idea of what
kind of football team the Panthers
have.

If you talk to Panther coach Mike
Gottfried, you will get an entirely dif-
ferent perspective. ”N.C. State has
reason to feel good about them-
selves,” said Gottfried. ”Overall,
they're a very good football team. We
have a tough game ahead of us.”

Indeed, they do. Pitt is facing a very
confident team with new enthusiasm.
The Wolfpack is excited about its
program, which is under the direc-
tion of fi rst-year coach Dick Sheridan,
formerly of Furman University.

Sheridan is trying to pump new life
into a team that has suffered three
consecutive 3-8 seasons. So far, he
has done just that. N.C. State has a
new attitude, and it was obvious in
last Saturday's 38-10 romp over inter-
state-rival East Carolina.

While Sheridan's revitalization
project has already led to a victory,
Pitt is still searching for its first win
under first-year mentor Gottfried,

. who is doing his own resurrecting for

the Panthers.
If Gottfried is to get his first ”W”

Saturday night, Pitt will have to score .

some points, something they had
trouble doing against Maryland.

Gottfried has taken some of the
blame for that himself. ’’I take it per-
sonally when the offense doesn't
score,” commented Gottfried. ”lt’s
my job to get them in there. I call the
plays.” Forty-five of those were
passes against the Terrapins.

Gottfried said that whether Pitt will
primarily run or pass against the
Wolfpack depends on how things go
in the early part of the game.

N.C. State has two excellent defen-
sive cornerbacks in seniors Nelson
Jones and Derrick Taylor. If Pitt has
trouble passingthe ball against them,

it will go to the running game. That
should be pleasant news to junior
Charles Gladman and sophomore
Craig ”Ironhead” Heyward, who will
probably replace the injured Tom

‘ Brown. Gladman and Heyward car-

ried the ball only 11 times combined
against Maryland.

Defensively, the Panthers will have
to contain senior All-ACC quarter-
back Erik Kramer, who leads the op-
tion attack for the Wolfpack. ”We
really have to put some pressure on
him,” said Gottfried.

Last season Kramer threw for 2,510
yards. That is why Sheridan hasn't
completely abandoned the passing
game. N.C. State will also run out of
the l—formation so that they can utilize
Kramer's ability to throw. The Wolf-
pack has‘ two speedsters at the
receiver position in Haywood Jeffries
and Nasrallah Worthen.

N.C. State offensive coordinator
Ted Cain doesn't foresee any major
changes in strategy for the Pitt game.’

"’We will still have the same game

plan,” said Cain. ”We want to run
the ball at Pitt. We'll mix in some op-
tions and throw the ball into their
man coverage.”

Pitt shut down the-Wolfpack

/

 

rushing game in last season's 24-10
Panther win. If they can once again
stop the rushing attack, N.C. State
will be forced to throw, putting the
pressure on Pitt's defensive backs.

Despite a few breakdowns in
coverage against Maryland, Gary
Richard, Teryl Austin, Billy Owens
and Quintin Jones did a good job
against the Terps. Hopefully, they
will do even better against Kramer
and the Wolfpack.

If the game should come down to

‘the kicking game, that is where N.C.

State has an edge. The Wolfpack has
two senior kickers. Kelly Hollodick
does the punting, while Mark Cofer
handles the place-kicking chores.
Cofer, who has made 38 of 52 career
field goals, is one of the best kickers
in the country. _.

Meanwhile, Pitt's two kickers are
both freshmen who have never
played in a road game before. In fact,
Jeff Van Horne will be making his
college debut, replacing Mark Brasco
as the place—kicker. John Rasp will
handle the punting -

The Panthers need a boost in the
kicking game. Brasco missed three at-
tempts in the loss to Maryland, forc- H
ing Gottfried to make a change, more" I

 

 

so because of Brasco’s ineptitude,
than Van Horne’s ability. That is not
meant to slight Van Horne, who has:
a strong leg and good potential. Yet, -
he is a freshman. ’ _ ' 3'
Gottfried hopes the change is for.
the best. ”What we need right now,’
is someone to jell in the kicking spot
for us,” said Gottfried. ’’I’m hoping.
for Van Home to have a good day;
and gain some confidence for himself
and the team.” I »
The Panthers will have to play a 3
strong all-around game to win. N.C."
State is an enigma. On paper they,
look good, but they are still not as
talented ~__as Pitt. But remember, ,
they're playing on their home field, — _-
and when a team such as Pitt takes 7 
to the road, anything can happen.’
The Panthers will have to playbetterl
than they _did against Maryland to “
win. . *
”There’s an old adage that you see
the most improvement in your team "
between the first and second game,’-’
said Gottfried. ”And I hope that is
true in our case. Our attitudes are fine .
and our work habits are fine. The

Following their sixth consecutive

 win, the Lady Panthers are at the top

of the Big East heap. Pitt upped their
overall record to 7-1 with wins over

 Duquesne and Robert Morris
 Wednesday night.

Although neither game was in con-
ference play, the Colonials and the
DuChes’ses provided Pitt with
valuable experience. The Lady Pan-
thers played virtually perfect
voHeybaH.

Duquesne lost to Pitt 15-4, 15-0
and 15-0. This was the first time in
Coach Collier’s Career that his team

won two straight matches 15-0.
Louise O’Shaughnessy was the start-
ing setter for the Lady Panthers. In her
first year as a Collegiate setter, she's
struggled with inconsistencies. The
setting position is very important to
Pitt's game schema. Coach Collier
said, ”Louise played her best game
of the season. She literally‘ made no
mistakes.” Denise Frawley made 10

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September I2, I986.

of 11 attempted kills with no errors.
This is the best attack percentage
Denise has ever had. These two fac-
tors were definitely decisive in the
Lady Panthers first win.

Robert Morris also lost in three
quick matches to the Lady Panthers
15-3, 15-6, 15-2. Freshman Lori Silk
filled in at the setting position. Denise
Frawley had 10 spikes and one error.

Coach Collier noted that,”lt was
gratifying to win and make so few
mistakes. In the previous games, we
made mistakes. The team was deter-
mined not to make mistakes as we
prepare for the match with Santa Bar-
bara.” The few mistakes made by the
Lady Panthers are an indication of
their rapid improvement. Pitt will
play host to some of the strongest
teams Sept. 17 ‘and Sept. 18. The
Lady Panthers will play nationally
ranked Santa Barbara Friday night
and the Georgetown Hoyas Saturday.
After defeating defending Big East
champion Providence, Georgetown
is the next roadblock in the Panthers
way of a Big East title. Pitt is going
to have to play extremely well to
achieve its goal of winning the Big
East title. Georgetown is an ex-
perienced team. Numerous letterwin-
ners are returning to the Hoya
program. Coach Collier feels that Pitt
is definitely up to the Challenge. The
Lady Panthers will be scrimmaging
against male volleyball players Sun-
day to gear up for the style Santa Bar-
bara will most probably use.

eCollier coaching with
concern for classroom

‘ By Tracy Milavec

Sta ff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball team has
a great deal to boast about. Coach
Shelton Collier has assisted with the
U.S. Women's Olympic Volleyball
Team, and he is a final candidate for
the position of head coach of the U.S.A.
Junior National Team and the U.S.A.
World University Games Team. The
team has the highest Q.P.A. of any
team at Pitt, and they are also No. I in
the Big East Conference.

How can a team accomplish all of
this? Coach Collier attributes their suc-
cess to the commitment of each in-
dividual to do well. ”I try to recruit
smart, intelligent players who are suc-
cessful students as well as athletes,”
noted Collier.

Collier also helps the players keep up
with their studies by arranging a
schedule that allows them to stay in
class for the longest possible time. ’’If
the players have a class during a
scheduled practice, they are required
to attend the class,” said Collier.

Besides having the highest Q.P.A.,
the team is also nationally ranked, and
they have a good national reputation
for being hard-working players. Coach
Collier feels that last year they did not
live up to their reputation. He thinks
they were overconfident and therefore
not successful. This year the team is
dedicated, committed and harder-
working. ”We can walk into any gym
and compete with pride,” said Collier.

Collier feels that his experience with
the Olympic team has helped the Lady

They had better. If the Maryland
game was important, this game is im-
perative. Pitt can’t afford to start the

it is one of Pitt's easier foes on the

ber. ’’I think we could have won this
game if our offense had not played
so bad. The defense was good, only
our offense needed help.”

The last 27 minutes of the half were
very physical, and as a result,
numerous players ended up on the
turf. Luckily, there were no major in-
juries, and the game ended 2-0 in
favor of the Panthers. ”We played
well,” said Pitt junior John Chaivin.
”But we are a young team that has
to work harder. The good thing is that
we took advantage of the breaks.”

The big question on everyone’s
mind was.,how new Pitt goalie Mark
Hendricks would perform. Although
he did not have many plays, the ones
he had to stop, he did. So as of now,
it looks like coach Luxbacher made
the right decision.

East Eddie vs. Diamond Dcive   

Y9“ -_’

A _; , t; By Jim Urban

:1?

 
  
  

   

,« .. '71 /.--._- 3~~_ _
. 4 ’o..\'I

  

lt was about a year-and-a-half
ago when the rumors first started.
Van Halen was enjoying the success
of /984, the band's most popular
album up to that point, but the pro-
- blems were just beginning.

Lead singer David Lee Roth is
perhaps the most outrageous per-
sonality in the rock music industry.
He had completed a solo project,

and, thanks in part to M—TV, he was
' quickly becoming one of the hotter
properties in Hollywood. When the
time came for Roth to venture back
into the studio with fellow Van Halen
members Edward Van Halen, Alex
Van Halen and Michael Anthony,
things did not go as planned’. Ed-
ward claimed that Roth was not
prepared, and the band, for the time
being, was in limbo.

Roth, who loves being in front of
the camera, had grandiose delu-
sions about making a movie that
would carry the same title as his first
solo ER, Crazy from the Heat. The
proiect fell through.

ln the meantime, the remainder of
Van Halen pondered about what
could be done with the band. The
possibility of making an all-star
album existed (with artists like Phil
» Collins sitting in with the band), but
that idea was bagged just like Roth’s
movie.

Van Halen, now officially divested
of Roth, finally made what would be
their final move — they enlisted the
services of solo artist Sammy Hagar.
The band took off from there.

The first production of what many
called ”Van Hagar,” titled .5/50,
swept the nation. The band did keep
the name Van Halen, and 5/50 is
their most successful album ever,
_with or without Roth.

5 Now,’ Roth has resurfaced with an

  

  

STEVENiSPlELBERG'p.ese&is

album of his own, Eat ’em and
Sm/'/e. Consequently, the debate
has begun. The questions are many,
and the answers few. Who has got-
ten the best of whom? Who has
assembled the better band? Who
will sell more albums? And who real-
ly controlled the direction and sound
of the old Van Halen?

A Warner Brothers press release
said that ”David Lee Roth is back,
bigger, badder, better than ever
before, and he's not alone.” Well,
sounds like ol’ Dave is writting his
own press releases a bit, but hey,
maybe he has the right to boast.

Who has gotten the best of

whom?
When the new Van Halen played
at the Civic Arena in the early

spring, there were signs saying '

"Van Hagar," and others asking
”Dave who?”

Well, his name is David Lee Roth
for you forgetful fans, and the truth
is, if you compare 5/50 to Eat ’em
and Sm/'/e, the best overall song,
”Yankee Rose," comes from Roth.

”Yankee Rose” was written about
the Statue of Liberty and is fast pac-
ed. lt sounds a lot like the old Van
Halen.

' Who has assembled a better

band?

Lead singer: lt would probably

edge to Roth. His voice is the focus

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September l2, i986

Anderson’s Home is
where the heart is

By Douglas Payne

Perhaps the greatest injustice for

. a performance artist is popularity.

Although there is a certain amount
of irony in this, one of the unwritten
rules of performance art is that the
audience must become a part of the
artwork. Such an intimacy is
established in an emotional, yet
vague, relationship that exists bet-
ween artist and audience. Once the
artist becomes ap ealing to the
masses, however, tfiat relationship
begins to crumble, and the appeal
becomes gradually more com-
merical. Nowhere is this more evi-

dent than in the case of Laurie.

Anderson, who abandoned the
Manhattan art scene in l979 in
favor of a national recording con-
tract, world tours and commercial
filmmaking. Regardless of her sellout
status, she retains an intimacy to a
certain extent and maintains a

warm, if not broad, relationship with ‘

her audience — even on film.

Laurie Anderson's debut film,
Home of the Brave, made its Pitts-
burgh premiere on Wednesday
evening at Pittsburgh Filmmakers at
the Fulton and, if you recall, it was
the Filmmakers who also sponsored
Laurie's l982 performance at
Carnegie Music Hall. The film is

more than just an ode to Anderson's
wonderful talent for music, dance
and visuals. It becomes a vehicle
which properly expresses the com-
plex blend that the combination of
the three yields. Anderson uses the
film merely as a medium to extend
her shows to those unable to see her
performances much in the way the
Talking Heads had done in Stop
Making Sense. With the exception
of a few subtitles, however, the film
never acts to transcend her perfor-
mance like the video for ”Sharkey’s
Day" did, but that was not the in-
tention here. As you will discover,
Laurie Anderson, who turned 39 in
June, cannot merel be com-
prehended on vinyl aone, as her
song ”Radar” proves. On record,
the son is an electronic soundscape
of feed ack with Laurie's dissonant
voice yelling out, ”hey  why... ,”
over a sadly lyrical piano playin a
hauntedlundertone. In the film, flue
song becomes an effective and im-
passioned cry for humanity in an in-
dustrial wasteland.

Filmed as part of her i985 Mister
Heartbreak tour, Home or’ the Brave
may, seem like a disjointed effort
comprised of songs, stories and
standup routines, although there
really is a common thread to this
rather difficult, if not funny, tapestry.
”This movie is very much about

technology," claims Anderson. ”lt’s
also about how people relate to
technology —— a lot of people trying
to tame their machines, tr ing to
keep them in line and still make
something that feels human." Her
songs certainly reflect this attitude,
given that her delivery is warm and
personable over the electronics and
digital wizardry of her band. She
throws out cliches with a diction that
makes them all her own and grins
with a hospitable knowingness she
shares with you. She seems to be
saying that she's figured it all out,
and s e knows you've figured it out
too; you just don't know it yet. Or
if ou have, she knows you're not
toning. Her earthy, yet brainy, de-
meanor is as candid as it is ordina ,
and she avoids arrogance and self-
indulgence, the major pitfalls of such
an art form. Like a new-wave Mark
Twain, she lives up to her own claim
of simply being a storyteller.

Home of the Brave is a film of how
society interacts with its technology
and emotions and the disjunctions
which occur thereof. While this is a
basic premise in performance art,
Anderson transcends it to show how
it envelops many facets of our lives,
not just one. Sociolo ically, she's
probably the closest thing to a Bob
Dylan that music has seen in the last
lO years (including Bob Dylan). Yet

Laurie asks two game show guests

in all, its a fun time and one can on-

BRING ON THE NIGHT
Sting
A&M (import)

By John Mccombe

Dream of the Blue Turf/es
presented us with an interesting-
paradox. Sting had recruited
some of the finest young jazz

players available. Daryl Jones
was a bassist with the Miles

Davis Group, Omar Hakim was

a mainstay at the drum kit for
Weather Report, and Branford

«Marsalis had excelled as both a

soloist and with the bands of Art

Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, as well ‘

as his brother Wynton.

Sting intended to use this
group to augment the spare
rock-reggae sound that he had
created with the Police. This
would not be an outlet, he pro-
mised, for an English rock star's
attempts at jazz noodling. No,
Sting would combine the best
elements of both jazz and rock
in order to create some totally
new noises. The end product
was a disappointment. Why

, had Sting bothered to collect

such talent if their presence was

 

Sting: formerly known as
Gordon Sumner.

to be so weakly felt on a series
of dirge-like compositions? This_
is not to suggest that Dream was
an unsuccessful venture, but
rather an inappropriate

' showcase for the musicians in-

volved. - A

Bring on the Night, both the
film and the new live recording,
should resoundingly silence any
doubts about Sting’s dream
band. The majority of the new,
live double-set was culled from
performances in Paris and Rome,
performances which allowed the
group to stretch out instrumental-
ly. The sound of these record-
ings is comparable to a painter
who discovers that the primary
colors on his palette may be
mixed. Whereas Dream of the
Blue Turtles was the conclusion

of The Wizard of Oz relegated

to black and white, the new_
album bursts into technicolor

glory from the opening strains of
its title track.

Since "Bring on the Night"
had always shared a chord pro-
gression with ”When the World
is Running Down," the two have
been fused here into an i l
minute showcase for keyboard-
ist Kenny Kirkland. For almost

three minutes, Kirkland locks
himself in fifth gear and delivers
some dangerously high speed
runs. Another seamless segue is
the pairing of "One World"
with "Love is the Seventh
Wave.” The latter piece is
highlighted by a wonderfully
woven sax solo by Branford
Marsalis. More than any other
player here, Marsalis benefits
from the new, looser ar-

rangements and ”Children’s

Crusade" provides the proof.
As Sting ties together the
crusades of the llth century,
World War l and the heroin
trade of modern day England,
lvlarsalis explores the full range
of his horn with a bittersweet
flavor that complements the
song perfectly.

No performance on Bring on
the Night is less than inspired,
but ”| Burn For You" is in
another league completely. lt

Regrettably though, the best

out a unique musical niche in the
late I970s. The Doctor And The
lvledics’ I986 album, laughing
At The Pieces, approximates the
way The Jam might have sound-
ed had they instead been listen-
ing to The Turtles, The Monkees
and Norman Greenbaum; and
singing about nature, hope and
a vague spirituality.

Doctor And The lvledics most_

resemble The Jam in two
respects. Like Paul Weller, the

 

Doctor makes his average voice
sound above average by pick-
ing out infectious melodies to
sing and by supplementing his
vocals with tasteful back-up
singing (in the Doctor's case by
the soulful Anadin ”Brothers"
Wendi and Collette). Steve
lVIaguire’s guitar work, too
resembles Weller's; his most-
employed sound is a crisp,
trebly distortion, and his riffs sim-
ple but ear-grabbing.

Doctor And The lvledics have

in no way ‘achieved anything

resembling what The Jam did in
its day, nor are they likely to be
part of a great rock re-
evaluation. But they do have a
winning album in Iaughin At
The Pieces, and a Iistenagility
that increases with every track of
their record.

Best are ”Miracle Of The
Age" with its infectious beat and
great .chorus, the flashy pop of
"Watermelon Runaway" and
the guitar-dominated "Moon
Song.” Less impressive are
”Lucky Lord Jim” with its tireless-
ly repeated riffsxand the silly
”No One Loves You When
You've Got No Shoes.”

If one fault stands out on this
full-length debut, it's that some
tracks sound a bit flat and
reserved in their studio incarna-
tions. But the hooks seem firmly
in place throughout most of the
album, and Doctor And The
Ivledics seem a viable '80s pop
rock band with roots firmly en-
trenched in '60s pop and the
musical revolutionaries of the

late '70s.

OUT 0F BOUNDS
(Soundtrack)

Various Artists

IRS Records

. By John Young

With the soundtrack to the film
Out Or’ Bounds, IRS Records
upholds the music industry tradi-
tion of offering inconsistent,
forgettable albums of movie-
accompanying music.

This record isn't without
highlights, of course. Though it's
been around for some time now,
Siouxsie And The Banshees’
"Cities In Dust” is a riveting blast
of tough, melodic rock. And
Tommy Keene's never-before
released ”Run Now" is some
refreshing, guitar-steeped pop.
But no other really great tracks
surface on the remainder of the
album.

_ Intimate Strangers provide
bland, latin—flavored dance
music with ”Raise The Dragon,”
and the extended mix of The

"American

tronic workout despite a strong
lead vocal. Also bad, the new
Night Ranger song ”Wild And
Innocent Youth” amounts to lit-
tle more than a string of lyrical
cliches and tired guitar soloing.

Perhaps the most frustrating

‘songs from Out of Bounds,

however, are those. featuring
weak performances by some
talented acts. Stewart Cope-
land”s title song never takes off
(in part due to Adam Ant’s ten-
tative singing), ”Electric Ocean"

I finds The Cult’s sound stripped

down to expose some of their
biggest weaknesses (no singer,
for openers) and The Lords Of

The New Church just end up

" ”Fresh Flesh.”

If you're in search of a
coherent, adventurous sound-
track album, forget about Out
Of Bounds, a surprisingly weak
collection from a record label
better known for more worth-

When Roth assembled his band, .
he knew he had to get a guitarist

description. He compliments Roth
well and doesn't steal as much of

Roth once said of the old Van
Halen trying to make a video for M- ’
TV: "We would make sure
everything is perfect, rehearse it
over and over,‘ then Alex would‘
come in and screw it up.’-’

Alex Van Halen is one of the least
known members of Van Halen, liv-
ing in the shadow of his brother Ed-
ward, then Roth, and now Hagar,
but he can play drums. He also now
possesses perhaps the most
outrageous personality in the band.

Greg Bissonette is Roth's drum~
mer. He is adequate, but doesn't
add much to the band.

Edge: Alex Van Halen.

Who will sell more albums?

It is a tough call — time will tell for
sure‘. Van Halen had great success,
but Roth is so marketable, there is no
telling how many albums he will sell.

The SI million question: Who con—
trolled the sound and direction of the
old Van Halen?

Roth sounds more like the old Van
Halen, but maybe Sammy Hagar
and Edward Van Halen planned it
that way. Edward Van Halen is such
an accomplished musician, that
perhaps his wide range of abilities
allowed his new group to experi-
ment and get away from the old
sound. Times change and so do
people — maybe Edward Van
