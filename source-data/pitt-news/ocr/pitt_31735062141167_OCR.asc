T Classroom
A Presen ted

By Greeks

Fifteen years of work by pro-
fessors, students, private, citizens,

"and members of the Greek govern-
'ment will come to an end Friday
"evening when the Greek seminar

classroom is formally dedicated
and presented to the University.

Head of the Greek Orthodox
church in Americas, the Most Rev-
erend Archbishop Athenagoras,

’ will follow an ancient Greek cus-
tom as he blesses the new room
and leads in the holy ritual which
will accompany the dedication.

Twenty-ﬁve visiting professors,

"here to conduct seminars on the
day of the dedication, scores of

Greek citizens and students, who

‘have worked for a decade for the

completion of the room, will attend
the ceremonies.

In 1930 the premier of the Greek

government, General John Metax- ‘

as, gave his approval to the gift of

.$1,200 from the Greek nation, to be i

added to other contributions gath-
ered in America.

But it was 1939 before a ship,
the S.S. Exeter slipped out of a
Greek port, and through the Med-
iterranean with a cargo of 10 tons
of marble destined for the Greek
YOOITI.

February this year Demetrios
Kokotsis, world-famous Greek ar-
tist, began the decoration of the
Greek room, using the ancient for-
mula of paint mixed with beeswax.

Each of the 80 coffered squares
on the ceiling of the room was
hand-painted, and the 23 karat
‘gold leaf was applied by hand.
Kokotsis decorated the massive
door with its many squares and or-
namented it with carved rosettes
of gold.

Exact proportions, symmetry of
arrangement, and the skillful use
of columns all give the .room the
appearance of the temple, or of a
room where “Socrates or Plato
may have taught.”

Into this room Friday night will
come a procession of Pitt students,‘
all of Greekdescent and wearing
the costumes of the ancient Greeks.

In the procession will be Johanna
Capetan, C44; Christina Kamaras,
644; Mary Vellis, C45; Mary Vri-
onides; Helen Hadgis, C45; Mary
Sarantopoulos, C43; Kay Kavouras,
C42; and Bebe Spanos, C43.

Participating in the program
will be Lillian Demestichas, secre-
tary of the Greek room, who will
read portions of the ‘-‘lllia'd" of
Homer in the old Greek tongue.

Men are wanted to work in the

post office during Christmas vaca-

' tion, James Rush, assistant to the
director of student employment,
stated today. Wages of at least
40 dollars a week have been guar-
anteéd.

Applicants have been asked to
meet in 132 Cathedral at 2:30
o'clock Thursday. iThose unable
to attend this meeting should con-
tact Rush in the office of student
employment, 804 Cathedral.

Those who work this year will
be given preference in this work
next year, Rush pointed out.

Bowman Sees Drive

As Significant Effort

ROY UMBLE AND SPEAKERS
orders for the big drive

Students, Faculty ;
Address Classes

The United Fund today begins its cam-
paign on the Pitt campus with an extensive
personalized drive to contact all University
students in an attempt to make this the
greatest effort of its sort in Pitt history.

In every class today during the third hour,
and second hour tomorrow, student or fac-
ulty representatives will contact the students
during the first 15 minutes of the period.

After a short talk on the history of the
campaign is given, contribution envelopes will
be distributed by classroom captains and their
aids, who will also collect them, and give-
back receipt envelopes containing a red feath-
er and a United Fund tag.

, Students not solicited in class may sub-
scribe at the offices of the dean of men or
dean of women. ‘

Theodore W. Biddle, acting dean of men
and head of the campaign, said that the cam-
paign this year has a dual goal—-—a- contribu-
tion from each student and contributions av-
eraging $1.50. ' ‘

“We hope that students will say, ‘We will

0 Endorses Campaign

Student leaders, members of the faculty,
and Chancellor ‘John G. Bowman threw their
support today to the student United Fund
drive which begins the third hour.

Chancellor Bowman said, “The United
Fund drive is the leading effort of Pittsburgh
toward ‘the American Way’.” It is an effort
to recognize our social problems and solve
them.

“The students at the University have done
their parts in former drives. We are asked
to do it again. Let’s do it.”

William Hammaker, executive secretary of
YMCA, stated, “The United Fund is every
student’s opportunity to accept his rightful
heritage of citizenship. To give honestly and
sincerely to meet human need is a first step
in winning his right to freedom in a democ-
racy.” ‘

President of SFA, Roy Ruane, C42, "com-
mented, “The United Fund drive is definitely
‘in line with student principles of supporting
that which is beneficial not only to students
but to others.”

in a recent issue of the, Pitt News
that theirs was THE party and.
the ONLY party that should be
taken into consideration when the
citizens of this great metropolis
go to the polls tomorrow.

Well, just in the way of a sug-
gestion, why ask their fellow vot- A
ers.to make the same mistake
twice? lsn’t one strong four year
dose of "bad city government
enough? Let's be sensible about
the whole thing; the administration
they want to return to office has
been given a fair trial and found
lacking in many, many things.

The man and party that we are
endorsing have been tried and have
not been found to be lacking in
those qualities that will guarantee
,this great, City of Pittsburgh an
honest, clean, unbossed, and cf-A
ﬁcient administration.

Striking-as it were out of a clear
bluc network, the ‘latest word in
radios cameto us as a mild shock.

A Cincinnatian has patented a
beauty shop chair with built-in
push button radio. ,No- patron of
the manicure table or its compan-
ionate features, we «are. dismayed
by the fact tliat we will not bene-
fit by this innovation.

But ever onward and upward, we
have in mind several other spots

    

where radios might be placed to
better advantage. ' '

For instance, newspaper offices

might install radios in their type-
writers, tuned only to stations that

p play fast music.

And crystal sets in the frigid-
aire, that play “Don’t Keep On
Doin’ What You’re Doin”’ when the
box is opened in the middle of the
night, would be a boon to mothers.

And for the student who’: go-
ing to be inattentive anyhow, why
not radioed notebook covers?

But of course if you buy yourself

a"portable and carry it with "you

wherever you go, you’ll save the

U. S. patent olﬁce a lot of trouble.

College’ newspapers, what with
their experimental tendencies and
their deep respect for modern writ-
ing with its subtle inuendos, are apt
to come out with some mighty un-
intelligible statements.

One of the most, confusing we
have read yet appeared in The
Brown and White, student publica-
tion of Lehigh university. It read:

“This department of the paper
wishes earnestly to apologize for
the contretemps into which it un-

wittingly - plunged on Friday so .

many of its devoted readers, when
it blithely wrote at exorbitant
length about a news story which,
for all the readers knew, was fic-
tititious and the product of a dis-
ordered imagination. I

"We apologize to all the boys at
Lehigh who - wondered what the
-devil Was going on at Beaver, and
we apologize to all thegirls at
Beaver who just -wondered what
the devil.”. .- ‘ .

And we apologise for running-
around in our night-shirt without

The Closed Union Shop

And, The Coal Strike  

ay .u.m:1rr Mnvamnc
The cardinal principle of union

policy is the maintenance of a solid
united front. History has shown
that without this unity unions can-
not succeed.

lt—

unitywhich is the sole reason for

is the maintenance of this

the mine strike now in the hands
of the mediation board. _Manage-
ment is determined to prevent the
adoption of a closed shop in the
mines. Labor will strike for it.
You~ may ask why a closed shop
is necessary to labor. It is this: to
achieve unity and solidarity all the
workers in a plant or in a mine
must be completely" organized. A
95 percent organization is not
enough. For as long as one man is
union bargaining-
power is cut by one-fourth. .100
per cent organization must be the
goal of all unions. It can only be
-attained and maintained by the in-
stitution of a closedshop.

The managements of all corpo-
rations know this well. That is the
only reason they oppose the closed

. shop.

But you may‘ ask if it is right
for labor to strike for a closed shop
in a time of crisis. The news-
papers would have us believe that
it should not. But, it must always
be remembered that these papers
are not unbiased, that they are in
fact controlled by the very inter-
ests which" oppose the closed shop.

To say that the strike of coal
miners has or will materially re-
tard the defense program to pre-
sent only a half truth. For the
strike of miners will retard the de-
fense program no more than the
actions of certain corporation man-
agers is retarding it.

 must remember that it was
V» who desire —

  

not of the working man, and not
of the unions.

For months the workers have
been lnrgaining with the operators
of the mines. Their conferences
have failed. And if the manage-
ment does not accede to the de-
mand for a closed shop, the pres-
ent negotiations will just as surely
fail. ‘ ~

If the managers of the mines de-
sire to stop the strike, let them
agree to the miners’ demands._

This is labor-’s golden opportu-
nity. Not to seize it, not to grasp
it and carry it through, would be to
set back for a generation the in-
evitable victory of labor. ‘

You cannot stop the forward
march of labor. You cannot stop
the tide of the future. -

'I‘hey’ve harvested the crop,
shocked the corn, swept the ker-
nels from the Nixon stage, and sent
“Johnny Belinda” on to its next
unsuspecting victims.

In place of this feverish melo-
drama which had about as ‘much
originality as “Bertha, the Beau-
tiful Sewing Machine Girl”, the
august and esteemed Theatre Guild
is bringing to town tonight a com-
edy for its first professional stag-
ing. s

“Papa Is All” is the title, and if
you have ever asked directions in
Lancaster county, you’ll know that
it smacks of the Pennsylvania
Dutch. »

The play was done last summel‘
by the Paper Mill Theatre in Mont-
clair, N. J. There, Lawrence ‘Lang-
er, who has a lot to- say about the
destinies of the’Guild, thought it

had possibility for professional
production.
Accordingly, Patterson Green,

thehauthor, made certain’ changes,
the Guild recruited what promises
to be a capable if not prominent
list of players, and we Pittsburgh-
ers who have always treated Guild
shows with more than their share
of consideration will first
judgment on it.

pass

Jessie ‘ Royce Landis and Carl
Benton Reid are the principal play-
ers. Miss Landis has not done any-
thing here in years, but Mr. Reid
has been here with Tallulah Bank-
head in “The Little Foxes.”

Advance information has it that
the chief character is one of those
long-haired Mennonite farmers, a
papa who rules-his household with
the proverbial rod of iron. When
his daughter sneaks off to Lan-
caster to see a movie with a boy
friend, his anger reaches such a
pitch that his long suffering family
is ﬁnally stirred to revolt.

That may not sound like too
much of an idea, but perhaps the
lines.are clever, or at least quaint.

Rhumba rhythm I by that old
rhumba rhythmer, Xavier Cugat,
set the Stanley crowd hip-swing-
ing and shoulder-tossing in what

,a press agent would probably. call

“gay abandon” this week.

Time was when Cugat used to
be regarded as an over-weight
Manhattan Latin with a band that
couldn’t keep time. But Carmen
Miranda, the Good Neighbor Pol-
icy, and the persistence ‘of these
South Americans have ﬁnally won
us over. As a result, Cugat is the
rhumba king, his Cubans pound-

ing out ol¥—beat rhythms in a way ’

calculated to make the Stanley
seem like an Havana night spot
when a cruise ship gets in.

Around him, Cugat has gathered
a list of Latin entertainers who are
talented and smart. There is Mi-
guelito Valde to do some singing,
the Ken Christie choir to repeat
same of their songs done on the
air; and, of course, the gal who
follows the Carmen Miranda pat-
tern. o

On the screen, things are much
quieter. They have remade “Smi1in’

'Throug ”, the little bit of senti-

ment and sacchrine that had,every-
body wiping away tears when first
done a dozen years ago.

This time some songs have been
put into the story for Jeannette
MacDonald to warble and this is
all very nice, even though it doesn’t
speed up the action. Brian Aherne
plays opposite Miss MacDonald in
this story of a romance blighted
by jealousy at its climax.

Gene Raymond, Miss MacDon-
ald’s real-life husband, has a prom-
inent part and goes through sev-
eral ‘romantic scenes with his wife
as though he enjoyed it.

“Smilin’ Throug .” may be
slightly sticky with sweetness, but
the formula is tried and true. Brok-
en romance amid lace frills and
hoop skirts in a May garden is al-

- ways sure ﬁre at the box oﬂice.

stud-2,    Friends f 
in   Despite War 

By SYLVIA SACHS , , \

There was a time when corre-
sponding with someone in France
was nothing unusual. But since
the war most people have lost con-
tact with their firilends in that coun-
try. " V I ‘ 7 I— -

Harriet Bauer, C44, is one of the
few who has continued; writing.
She hears-rriiigularlyl from Arletta
and Maurice Ardair, of Firminy,
Loire, near. St. Ettienne, France.
Arlette, 18, goes. to _.school, and
her brother who is a year younger
works in‘a factory.

Although a young uncle is in a
1 concentration camp, and although

they once heard the booming of ~

distant cannons, the actual war to
them seems very far away.

Their letters reveal that the
greatest suffering is due to the
shortage of many of the necessi-
ties of life. Women have started
wearing wooden-soled shoes, and
hats, belts, and collars made of the
famous St. Etienne ribbons. In her
last letter Arlette described a typ-
ical dinner menu undergthe ration
system: '

Salad without oil
465 grains ofmacaroni
305 grains of beef
100 grains of cheese

- Fruit

Arlette sent Harriet several re-
.productions of the people and build-
ings of her town. The unusual part
of the cards is the fact that ﬁgures
are all made of English and French
postage stamps which she has cut
and pasted on. One girl’s jacket
had a picture of the king of Eng-
land on it. In addition to these

Highlights

By far the best brand of com-
petitivc fooball seen here in many
‘an moon, was uncorked on Stadium
-soil Saturday, as 50.000 ﬂabbeiw
_g-astcd fans and fancttes watched
Sn over-conﬁdent Ohio State squad
gang forced to light right down

:to the ﬁnal gun, against a super-

.-stubborpn Pitt eleven. No, the
Panthers didn’t win the game that
showed the Buckeyes in front of a

21 to 14 score, when ﬁnal tallies
were taken. But the gridiron skill

and spirit displayed by the Blue ’‘

and Gold, proved a very welcome

' and gratifying surprise to the

gathc3'ing'.

He was marked as a “comer” in
his sophomore year, this fellow
‘culled Jones. And though he took
a little while in getting there, Ead-
gar (ten cunts in stamps 
really hit his peak, Saturday. The
‘Panther halfback didn't score the
 of Pitt’: double-feature day
touchdowns. But after two loll:
Edgar gallops, that netted one yard
less than half the Held. and 533")’
placed the pigskin on the Buckeye
_half-yard stripe, fullback Frank
Saltsa plunged for the score.

Then, midway in the third ‘pori-
od. Ohio State's husky Dick Fisher
let loose with a looping forward m-

- tended for Dick Burgett on the

midiiehl ‘stripe, but Jones leaped,
spewed, then dodged, twisted. and
sq-uirmcd for forty-ﬁve yards and
the second Panther score.

And speaking of Fisher, there-‘s
.3 rumor ﬂoating around that the
fellow was soaked in grease befoae
the contest. There was just no
stopping the Buckeye back- Dur-
ing his 35 yard run in the thizd pe-
riod which accounted for Ohio
State’s third tally, four Pitt men
had Fisher at four different points
along the way, but none of them
could pull him to e.art‘h. And Fish-
or wasn’t the only Brown backﬁeld
man to attract attention. There
was Tom Kinkadc, and Les Hor-
‘vath, and Jack Hallabrin, and lit-
tle-bilg man Jim Daniel}, and Bob
Show; each and all of whom blast-
ed Pitt’s best victory attempt.

Sally Rand was at Saturday’s
game. Not the fanned bit of fem-
inity, but the dangerous gridiron
girl, that seemed to lluster and
amaze the Pitt line. It was that
oldie, “the naked reverse." Al-_
most every time Ohio State tried
it, and it was often. the Panthers
built a wall of defense around one
side of the line, the wrong side,
giving a lone, unprotected Buckeye
runner with the all--important pig-
skin, free reign to tick oﬂ proﬁt-
hlsle yardage. The Panthers tried
their version of it once, but all it
netted was a fumble.

Getting back to some of the Pan-
ther gridmen, Jack Du:-ishan play-
pd a surprisingly perfect defensive
game. Only the color of his uni-
form, prevented mistaking him for
3 Buckeye backﬁeld man. To say

Grid Tilt

STANLEY GERVELIS
Plays Usual Brand of Bali

that Stan Cervelis performed as
usual, is praise enough for the
Charleroi end.

One of the most amazing phe-
...,mena of the Panther squad,
seems to he thereducnted toe of
Ralph Fife. Fife has been called
upon only three times to kick the
pigskin over the uprights after a
‘touchdown (once against Duke,
and twice Saturday), and he has
succeeded on each occasion. Ralph
doesn’t have to warm the bench,
as is usually the case, and wait un-
til time for toe-action. He’s been a
defensive “rock of Gibralter” for
the Pitt cause. in every game this
year.

Once again, the Pitt rooting sec-
tion liled on to the ﬁeld to greet
the Bowsermen as they trotted on-
to the Stadium. It was this dis-
play of encouraging spirit, that
evoked many a compliment from
the, ha:-d-boiled, uncmotional fel-
lows in the press box. Pitt stu-
dents have shown a remarkable
amount of tolerance and under-
standing, and really deserves sev-
eral dozen rousing cheers. And to
Aldo lcardi and his cohorts, who
have had 9. great part in this dis-
play ofsupport, should go an ex-
tra back-pat or two.

In spite of the (lefcat, 50,000
fans and Coach Charley Bowser
seemed satisﬁed with the Panther
performance. Our team may not
be RED hot, but we’re iapidly
warming up-. So look out there,
For-dl1am,‘ jus’ LOOK OUT! I 1

Jones’ Running, Pelssing, Kicking
"Brilliant ln Panther Squad Defeat

By ALEX ZELENSKI. Sports Editor.

A grim and determined Panther aggregation led by the
brilliant play of Edgar “Special Delivery” Jones, kept 50,000
people on the edge of their seats last Saturday afternoon when
they put on the most spectacular show of the year in losing‘
to a. heavily favored Ohio State eleven, 21-14.

It was truly ‘Edgar Jones day at the Stadium for he came
through with his finest piece of work since he began football
at Pitt four years back. He was a dangerous threat to the
Buckeye team every time he got his hands on the ball. Jones’
running was magniﬁcent, his passing accurate, and his long,

booming punts were feared by the enemy.

American last Saturday.

The game turned out to

people expected for Paul Brown’s
team, loaded with line backs ._and
linemen, were favored to chase the
timid Jungle Cat right out of the
Stadium. The 50,000 fans watched
and waited, but it didn’t happen.
It was not the same team that they
had watched against Purdue, Mich-
igan, Minnesota, and Duke, but it
was an inspired ball club. Fighting
every inch of the way, not willing"
to give ground.
A But the supe1“iorl*l‘o1-ces of’ the
Ohio team showed when they
clinched the game by a safety late
in the fourth period after they had
blocked one of Jones’ punts.

It didn’t take the Buckeyes very
long to get started for iust a few
minutes after the opening gun had
sounded, they scored their first
tally. A fumble by the local eleven
gave the Scarletand Gray the ball
on its own 40-yard line. Fisher
took the ball on the first play for
a 27 yard advance, then Tommy
Kinkade circled the right end of
the Panther line for a 32 yard run
and the score.

The second quarter was only
three minutes gone when Ohio
State had its second touchdown.
Bobby Shaw took the ball on an
end-around play and carried the
ball to the Pitt 22 for a gain of 21
yards. Then Burgett, and Fisher
took turns piercing the center of
the line up to the 2-yard line. It
took three more plays on the part
of the Buckeyes to put it over, but

He was an all-

bé quite different than most

they eventually did as Burgett
found a hole at left guard and
plunged through for the second
tally.» Once again the Buckeyes
missed their extra point.

Then Jones got started. He took
the kickoff on the goal line and
carried it back 18 yards. Then he
wheeled around left end for a 15
yard gain. Not content with that,
he took the ball on the following
play for a‘ 36-yardgain up to the
Ohio 28. A few stabs at the line,
and once again Mr. Jones at the
tailback, and once again another
substantial gain. This time up to
the 2-yard stripe. Saksa took the
ball over for a touchdown‘ on the
next play. Ralph Fife, kicking like
it is nothing out of the ordinary for
the Pitt team, added the extra
point. 0 ‘ : . ‘
Ohio State’; squad came on the
ﬁeld in the secondhalf led by he
unstoppable Fisher and promptly
started a sustained drive that net-
ted them their third score. In this
drive it was all Fisher. Fisher
around end, Fisher through tackle,
and Fisher over guard. He could-
n't he stopped.

But it seems that the Columbus
boys weren’t satisﬁed with their 19
points, and wantedniore. So deep
in their own. territory they started
to pass. But one of the tosses was
thrown right into the waiting arms
of Jones and he scampered, with

Mrs. Paul Brown, they told us,

So when Mrs. Brown came to
town, we went up to interview and
to ask her about the above. Only
Mrs. Brown didn’t know anything
‘about Washing and ironing the
team's uniforms, nor feeding or
tutoring the players. Furthermore.
Mrs.,B1-own had some shopping to
do and was there anything else we
wanted to know.

We could conduct the interview
while admiring the University. Mrs.

her friend. It is and so we begin
a combinating sightseeing trip and
interview.

On the elevator Mrs. Brown con-
ﬁdes that she has two sons. Would
she like them to play footboll?

that it is easier.

Mrs. Brown thinks the Syria-

informs us that Massillon High
school was more like 0. college
than most colleges. ‘

By the time we reach the Dar-
lington room Mrs. Brown is— talk-
ing freely. Mr. and Mrs. Brown
have been married twelve years.
The games at Massillon were all
played at night and an average of.
22,000 people watched each game.
The Browns have eight pet white
mice. Mrs. Brown loves football
and manages to be at every game
her husband's team plays. No,
Mrs. Brown does not know much
about how it feels to coach a los-
ing team. Mrs. Brown thinks
Northwestern was the better team
and  not feel l'.00 badly about
losing.

In the Dean of Women’: office
we again brought up the subject
of Mrs. Brown washing and iron-
ing Massillon’s uniforms. Mrs.
Brown then informs us that either

- we are kidding her or someone is

she left.

Ralph Fife was the bulwark of
the Panther defense as he seemed

Show Optimism
At Daily Drills

Basketball practice is continu-

and Dr. H. C. Carlson, Pitt's ﬂoor
mentor, continues to wax enthusi-
astic over the year's squad. Quot-
ing the good doctor, he says, “We
always have a great club until we
lose, and then we still are good."

Advancing from the preliminary
practice sessions, the team has now
reached the “hot '
chocolate" stage - 
according to “
Carlson. He also ,
stated that there
are not too many
men out for the
team this year, _
and that any boy ‘a
with the proper
spirit should
come out for the "
team. “We'll give them the skill
and endurance,” Carlson said, pro-
viding they have the “heart.”

 of Intramural Competition

Playing their first actual game
yesterday afternoon, the Punks
fulﬁlled the fondest expectations of
their fans as they swept an unre-
sisting Newman club toga 53-0 de-
feat.

Led by Tay Mala:-key,‘ last year's

champs gained almost at will, ad-
vancing the ball on every play
attempted except for two incom-
pleted passes. Malarkey, easily the
player of the day, scored 31 points
-and was a bear‘ on defense. The
Newmans showed as poorly on the
offense as they did on the defense,
gaining on only two plays, both of
them passes. I

In the second game of the day,
' the Phi Eps came back in the sec-
ond half to edge out Phi Delta
Theta 13-12. Losing 12-0 at half
time, the winners pulled two touch-
downs out of the bag as they un-
veiled a new star, freshman “Fig-
gy" Dutch, who ﬁgured in every
scoring play.

On their first touchdown play,
Dutch took the ball from center and

, handed it to Jay Silverburg, who
swept around end for the score.
The extra point try failed. The
second touchdown came "soon after,
when Dutch pitched a perfect pass
{to Alex Zelenski, who went over
with tying scorek The ﬁnal Phi Ep
point came on a pass, Dutch to
Goleman, and was enough to give
the game to the Neville st. house.

In the third game of the day, it
was the brawn of the Phi Kaps
versus the savage blocking of the
PiKA’s with the PiKA’s winning
in an overtime period, 7-0. On the
second play of this period, Marsh
Morgan took the «ball from center
and, aided by beautiful blocking
on the part of Chuck Page and
Gus Wilde, ran 40 yards for the
touchdown. A pass, Wilde to An-
derson, tacked on the seventh
point.

The most surprising result of
the day came in the Delt-Phi Gam
game, with the former winning
12-8. This loss eliminates last
year's champs. ,who had been de-
feated earlier in the week by the
Phi Ep squad.

In the two ﬁnal games of the
day, SAM defeated Theta Chi 18-0,
with Sapolsky starring, and Pi
Lambda Phi won a forfeit game
from Lambda Chi Alpha.

The headline attraction on the
intramural card today is the battle
between the AE&ME seniors and
the AE&ME fresh and sophs. Both
teams are undefeated and since
they represent the same organiza-
tion, this should be a contest
worth watching. The seniors are
defending champions of the engi-
neering circuit this season.

Another good game in the en-
gineering lea-gue should be the con-
test between the Civil A_’s and the
Civil Bis. ‘

By out OWN CORRESPONDENT

As was predicted last week, this
year is turning out to be the great-
est in intramural football history.

Startling upsets, new records, in~

fact everything imaginable have
happened already, and the season
is only two weeks old.

Perhaps the outstanding event
of last week was the steamroller
drubbing the Punks inflicted on
the Newman club. In running up
their _s3 points, oi. Punks gained
on nearly every play they tried.
Only twice during the entire game
did they throw passesythat weren't
caught. If that isn't perfection,
it’ll be good enough until some-
thing better comes around.
Everytime they got their hands
on the ball, the Punks scored. Be-

Information 0n   Tackles

By HARRY KINDELBERGER

‘ (E¢le'.tor"s note: This is the t_hz”rd
in a series of articles by members
of the football squad explaining
their position to the fan). ’

In 1939 we played Temple Uni-
versity at Philadelphia. We ﬁnally
won that game 13 to 7, but had we
.lost it, it would have been entirely
the fault of a tackle named Cole-
man who played on the Temple
squad. He was one player who was
Just too tough to handle. We
couldn't do a thing with him either
offensively or defensively. He broke

up most of our plays and kept us

He was eve ry
thing a ‘tackle
should be —but,
fortunately for
opposing teams,
, rarely are.
j Olfensively the

tackle must be a
. g 0 od blocker,
able to open for
his backﬁeld.

Speed is an essential, for he
must be able to pull out quickly t0
lead the interference. He must be
fast in order to cover on passes
after carrying out his blocking as-
signment, and it behooves the tac-
kle to get down quickly under
punts.

The good defensive tackle works
together with his end, the backer
up and the half back. He must
make sure that each knows just
how the other_is going to charge
on_ certain plays to avoid leaving

 

Co-recreation, which officially
started last week, has been a big
success thus far. A great number
of freshman men and women turn-
ed out for an hour and one-half of
fun and recreation in the gym.
Dancing was the keynote of the
meetings, with special instructions
being given all students who de-
sire it. i

This week, the same plan will
be followed. Tuesday and Thurs-
day, from 12:30 until 2:30 o'clock,
all freshman students are invited
to come down to the gym and par-
ticipate in this joint activity, an-
nounces Peggy Brennan, Ed 43,
chairman of WAA co-recreation.

All the latest records are being
provided for the use of the dance
enthusiasts.

holes for the opposition to plunge
through. The tackle should» vary
his method of charging into the

backﬁeld in order to keep the other
team guessing.

His style of play should be gov-
erned according to the down, the
number of yards to go for a ﬁrst
down, and the position of the ball
on the field. He should keep in
mind the plays his opponents are

,. using successfully for these are the

ones he can expect to see "most
often.

The fan, however, judges the
tackle not from what he should do
but from ‘what he seek him do.

Therefore, to judge the merits of
a tackle, watch how he charges
into his opponents backﬁeld. It
should be a low hard charge to
spill the interference. Note wheth-
er he merely spilled the interfer-
ence or made the tackle himself.

on 8 Pass or a punt, look to see
how well or quickly he charges in
to break up a play.

Oﬂensively, see whether he
chargedfast to open up a hold in
his own backﬁeld, or, if he did not
open up a hole directly, see wheth.
er he got down the ﬁeld to block.

But never expect to see the

tackle cross the goal line with the .

ball tucked tenderly under his
arms, for the tackle like the center

with their 53 points, the Punks es-
tablished a record for not having to
punt once during the entire game.

When a team plays ball like that
it is often hard to pick out one man
as the star, for it takes teamwork
to turn in a job like that one. How-
ever, to Tay Malarky goes the nod
as the Intramural star of the day.
Tay scored 31 points  He
was all over the ﬁeld, snatching

passes from everyone and every-

liant defensive ball, whenever the .
Punks were on the defensive, which ,_

One of the ‘greatest plays we have « ’

ever seen in intramural football
was pulled off last week‘ by Joe
Donahue, Phi Delt pledge. -

It happened this way. The Phi
Delts were playing the Sarmnies
and had just kicked-oﬂf _to their op-
ponents to open the second, half.
The ball was wet and the Sammies
fumbled with the Phi Delts recov-
ering about 15 yards from the goal
line. On the ﬁrst play Donahue
took the ball, and on a muddy ﬁeld,

.snakehipped his way through the

middle of the entire Sammies de-
fense and scored.

  Graper Discusses Future

Foremost among these will be
strong international organization
guided by the interests of all :na-
tions. » '

Small nations will probably play
the role of dependent states under
the protection of larger powers.
These dependent states, according
to Dr. Graper, will have represen-
tation in the international organ-
ization which will guarantee their
rights and have control over all
international trade, disputes, etc.

“If Hitler defeats England,'our
democracy will be threatened even
though we are still free,” declared
Dr. Graper. “The tremendous ef-
