Survey Reveals Students
View of Nebraska Primary

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

A Pitt News telephone sur-
vey shows that McCarthy sup-
porters are disappointed at his
showing in the Nebraska pri-
mary. Kennedy supporters ex-
pected a victory. and almost
everyone expected Nixon to car-
ry the Republican vote.

The Democratic results show-
ed Kennedy with 51 per cent of
the vote. McCarthy with 31 per
cent. Johnson-Humphrey with 15
per cent. and Wallace with one
per cent. In the Republican race.
Nixon received 68 per cent. Rea-
gen 23 per cent. and Rockefeller
six per cent.

A McCarthy supporter com-
mented that the fact that Kenne-
dy came away with such a large
percentage of votes shows only
he presents a good image to
crowds and that he has a strong
machine. He also feels that peo-
ple vote for Kennedy because of
his name rather than his qualifi-
cations as a candidate.

The '

One of Americ

Volume 62, No. 83

F r a n k Fasciano, sophomore,
feels that the results show that
McCarthy is obviously not the -
“people’s choice.” He was sur-
prised at the small Johnson-Hum-
phrey write-in, since the peace
talks are now going on.

One student. a Wallace support-
er. felt that although the Wallace
vote was small. he could possibly
gain enough support to hurt Ken-
nedy or Humphrey.

Marlene Schwartz. sophomore.
felt that Reagan’s 23 per cent was
significant because it showed his
strength against Rockefeller. She
feels that McCarthy is gaining a
“loser image” and that he is def-
initely losing support.

Marcia Nisenbaum, sophomore,
pointed out that because Nebras-
ka is such a strong Republican
state, the Democratic results of
the election are unimportant. A
Humphrey supporter, she feels
that his 15 per cent was impor-
tant in view of the fact that peo-
ple are not apt to vote for a write-
in candidate.

nzenfs.

Dear Mr. President:

I am writing to express both my
personal concern and that of the
faculty of the University of Pitts-
burgh over the effect of the cur-
rent draft regulations on graduate
and professional education in the
United States.

U n d e r current regulations.
graduate enrollments are expect-
ed to be reduced between 50 per
cent and 70 per cent. This would
do serious damage to the teach-
ing and research programs at our
universities. and to the nation’s
intellectual and professional life.
Since graduate teaching assistants
are essential to the conduct of un-
dergraduate instructional p r o -
grams. -a reduction of this magni-
tude in the number of graduate
students will seriously affect the
quality of undergraduate teaching
and impose severe limitations on
the ability of our universities to
meet the demands for undergrad-
uate education.

But more important. it would
create an interruption and a ma-
jor gap in the flow of highly skill-
ed manpower from the colleges
and universities. This ultimately
would affect every other aspect
of American life — government.

industry. science. law. social work.

engineering — and the impact of
this would be felt in our national
life for many years to come. The
achievement of many of our most
pressing domestic social goals
will be jeopardized. Such a con-
sequence is potentially as debil-
itating to the national life as war
or economic disaster.

Certainly no sensible American
would argue that college grad-
uates be exempt from military
service. Yet, neither can it be rea-
sonably argued, that it is in the
national interest to suddenly draft

most male college graduates and

t h e r e b y reduce drastically the
pool from which our most vitally-
needed intellectual manpower
must come. Moreover, it surely is
not in the interest of the armed
forces to be faced with a draft
pool composed in large part of
college graduates. A more waste-
ful and capricious use of human
resources can hardly be envision-
ed.

I urge you. therefore. to re-
consider this matter at the soon-
est possible moment. and to im-
pose a system of random selec-
tion by age groups in accordance
with your authority under the Se-
lective Service Act. The social.
political. economic and intellec-
tual life of the nation for many
years to come depends on your
decision.

Respectfully yours.

Wesley W. Posvar
Chancellor

For Alternation Change
In N ation’s Leadership  

“The American people want an
alternative,” Governor N e 1 s o n
Rockefeller told an enthusiastic
crowd of supporters and newsmen
at the Pittsburgh Hilton Wednes-
day. “Republican leadership,” he
asserted. “will offer a choice
throughout the state and local lev-
els of government."

The New York governor came
here to meet with Republican
Governors Shafer (Pa). Agnew
(Md) and Teeman (Neb. ); as part
of the Republican governors task
force: and to launch his Presiden-
tial campaign in Pennsylvania.

Rockefeller spoke briefly. an-
swered questions. and signed au-
tographs for about a half an hour
in front of the hotel. He shook
hands with his supporters. smiled.
and thanked them for their com-
pliments. Rocky showed that the
Kennedys did not corner the mar-
ket on charisma.

Faculty Senate Criticizes ROTC

by EARLE JACOBS

The University’s Faculty Sen-
ate has made several recommen-
dations concerning the Army and
Air Force ROTC programs at the
University. b a sed on a recent
study by the Senate’s Student Af-
fairs Committee.

The Student Affairs Committee
said that the ROTC programs dif-
fer in the following ways from
other University programs:

——Content of the courses is not
under the control of any Univer-
sity department. including th e
two R O T C departments. T h e
course contents are the results of
decisions made by the Depart-
ment of Defense.

— The administration of the de-
partments is not subject to con-
trol by any administrative office
of the University. Questions re-
garding the qualifications. hiring.

promotion. and replacement of
personnel are settled by military
chains of command.

— The subject matter is‘ largely
devoted to specific military pro-
cedures. military protocol. and
military organizations. Humanis-
tic or political analyses of mili-
tary actions are almost totally
lacking — with the possible excep-
tion of military history.

The Student Affairs Committee
stressed that these departures
from the structure and goals of
the rest of the University should
not overshadow the advantages of
a continuing relationship between
the academic community and the
ROTC program. This relationship
prevents the formation of a sepa-
rate military caste by easing the
recruitment of military officers
from the academic community.
permits a student to sample a mil-

itary career without making a fin-

al commitment. and provides a
continuing dialogue between the
academic and military profes-
sions.

Based on these considerations,
the Faculty Senate has recom-
mended that ROTC courses should
be offered as voluntary extra-cur-
ricular activities which carry no
academic credit. Also, the use of
academic titles for instructors of
ROTC courses should be discon-
tinued or modified by prefixes.
For example, the present title of
Professor of Military S c i e n c e
might become Adjunct Professor
of Military Science.

These: recommendations will be

referred to the Provost, Dr. Char-
les H. Peake. who will consult

’ with the respective heads of those

schools which presently offer aca-
demic credit for ROTC courses,
namely the College, School of En-
gineering, and School of Educa-
tion.

here.”

People’s Campaign rally shared
this hope. Hope was etched on
their faces, written in their hearts.
Not an optimistic, happy kind of
hope, but a sad, weary longing-
for—a—miracle type of hope. Afro-
Americans of all ages, sizes,
shapes and philosophies had come
together for the common cause of
justice and equality.

“I don’t know what’s going to
happen after this,” said a Detroit
woman who is participating in the
march, “but now we all have
hope, we’re not optimistic about
our chances for new legislation
but we’re all hopeful.”

The overwhelming majority of
the Negroes interviewed advocat-
ed non-violence but felt in the
backs of their minds that the only
significant progress that has been
made in race relations has been
brought about by violence.

A young black man from Mil-
waukee put it this way, “I be-
lieve in non-violence only as a
philosophy, violence in practice,”

as the best way to achieve equal- ,

ity.

“If you can get around vio-
lence, that’s fine,” stated Vern
Williams of Pittsburgh, “bu t
sometimes there has to be vio-
lence in order to get things done.
Martin Luther King marched for
13 years in non-violence to get
civil rights and it didn’t pass un-
til two days after his death and
the riots.”

Those interviewed agreed that
if Congress does not pass signifi-
cant legislation — and soon - the
only alternative will be more riots
and more bloodshed. These peo-
ple do not seem to want to resort
to criminal acts to achieve their
purpose. Aretha Thompson, 21, of
Pittsburgh feels that “Negroes are
tired of trouble.”

“We do not want to see our na-
tion die.” said Rev. A. D. W.
King, brother of the late Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King and the feature
speaker of the evening. “were
tired of little parts of the pie (of
freedom). when we come back to
Pittsburgh we’ll have the whole
pie.”

“I’m glad that I’m a part of
this,” said Eddie Fields and Mon-
tell Brundage, Schenley_ High.

NSA report on drug raids

Ninety Campus Drug Raids Made In US

by PAT BORKOWSKI

..In the four month period from
November 2. I967 to February 23.
the National Student Association
reports that there have been 90
drug raids involving 333 persons.
Most of those involved have been
college students arrested for pos-
session of marijuana. .

Colleges. large and small.
throughout the country have been
raided or “Busted.” The most fa-
mous raid was at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Stony
'Brool where students were roust—
ed out of bed just before dawn.

Stony Brook was not the only
college to face the pre-dawn raid
tactic. At Bard College. in New
York, police stormed onto the cam-
pus at 1 a.m.. setting up road
blocks. searching dorms and forc-
ing students out of bed. Thirty-
four students were arrested. four-

teen on drug possession charges
and the rest on charges from
drunk driving to harrassing an of-
ficer.

Even Lyndon B. Johnson’s alma
mater has been “busted.” In Jan-
uary, seven Southwest Texas State
College students were arrested for
possession of marijuana after a
month long investigation in which

college officials cooperated
closely with federal narcotics
agents.

Other colleges to feel the brunt
of the pre-dawn tactis included
Franconia and Keene State in New
Hampshire and American Univer-
sity in Washington. DC. College
newspaper editors at many large
schools. such as the Universities
of Wisconsin. Colorado and Cali-
fornia at Los Angeles. said ar-
rests for marijuana had been too
numerous to count.

Teacher Corps Seeks Funds Rocky Cites Need’ For Reform.

To Continue Program

Pittsburgh's three-year—old Tea-
cher Corps program to aid stu-
dents in disadvantaged school
areas has not yet been federally
funded. Presently. Teacher Corps
members are independently seek-
ing funds for its continuation.

Teacher Corpsmen work half
days in the schools supplement-
ing but not supplanting the regu-
lar teaching staff. They tutor.
work with small groups. teach
some regular classes. and develop
new methods for reaching and
teaching the disadvantaged stu-
dent. Corpsmen can also be grad-
uate students. Here. the Univer-
sity is the training center for the
Corps.

The intern program usually
takes two years to complete. Pitts-
burgh graduates its first group in
June.

The third year Pittsburgh Tea-
cher Corps program has not been
federally funded, however, begin-
ning September 1968, the corps
will not receive federal funds.
Washington has adopted an alter-
nate year funding policy, partly
because there are only enough
monies to cover 24 out of 65 pro-
posed programs.

Thus. the Pittsburgh program
won’t receive funds until Septem-
ber 1969.

"Any possible impact or effec-
tiveness in combating the educa-
tional problems of disadvantaged
students will be lost. if the pro-
gram is interrupted." said a Corps

spokesman. “Corps members have
resolved to seek funds for the
continuation of the program."

“Attempts are being made
either to increasd the total appro-
priation from Washington or to
raise funds locally,” the spokes-
man said.

The projected cost of next year's
program would be $440000. but
the funds are needed immediate-
ly." to plan and to recruit the
most qualified students for next
year.

Teacher Corps teams currently
work in schools in Hazelwood.
Homewood—Brushton. the Hill
District. and the Northside. There
are now 36 elementary interns.
10 secondary interns. and 10 team
leaders.

“A proposal that the University
support the Teacher Corps" effort
to fund and continue its program
will be presented to the faculty
Senate Friday." said the spokes-
man. ‘

Following this, he and the three
governors held a news conference
in the hotel. Rockefeller was ask-

"ed if he would “reasses his posi-

tion” after Nixon’s victory and
Reagan's strong showing in the
Nebraska primary. He said that he
couldn't have expected to get too
many votes because he wasn’t on

P the ballot. Governor Teeman add-

ed if he would”reassess his posi-
ing in Nebraska that would have
supported him had he entered that
primary.

Governor Shafer said that Rock-
efeller‘s candidacy is "giving peo-
ple a broader perspective." The
local governor feels that Nixon is
the front running contender for
the Republican nomination but
didn't have it “wrapped up" as
vet and doubted that the nomina-

Rockefeller wa s questioned
about the Vietnam bombing cessa-
tion. He feels that it could be
brought about “through skillful
negotiations“ but added that the
Johnson administration did not
need any advice on how to man-
age the Paris peace talks from the
Presidential candidates.

“You stated that the candidates
should speak out on Vietnam,” a
reporter reminded him.

“Yes." Rockefeller answered.

comment any further on this sub-

Rockefeller was asked how
many delegate votes he has thus
far. “No idea.” he replied. Will
Rocky enter the Oregon primary?
“I doubt very much if I will go
out there.” he answered. Who
will his running mate be? “I’ve
got a long way to go to think
about it." said Rockefeller.

  Some Facts

The Poor People’s March is a worthy non-violent campaign-
a campaign that is attempting to combat a white racism that is
responsible for some horrendous conditions in Pittsburgh and
the nation.

— Pittsburgh has the worst housing of any major US city.
Approximately 49 per cent of its housing is classified as de-
teriorating and 58 per cent of its “residential facilities” do not
have adequate plumbing.

« —A family of four living in Pennsylvania that subscribes
-to public assistance lives on merely $201 a month.

—In Allegheny County public assistance allows a maxi-
imum of $51 for rent and $16 for utilities. That leaves about 83
cents a day per person for all other living expenses.

—Only one and one-half per cent of those on welfare are
employable. The rest are children, their mothers, the disabled,
the blind, and the aged.

-— The United States spends $87 billion a year on the war in
Vietnam and two billion dollars a year on the war on poverty.

-— Pittsburgh has the highest unemployment rate in the Unit-
ed States.

— There are five times as many black college men employ-
ed in low income, low paying service and laborersi jobs as com-
pared with white college men.

The facts which were supplied to The Pitt News by the Uni-
versity chapter of the YMCA indicate deplorable conditions not
only in the United States, but especially in Pittsburgh. Persons
in this very city live in housing that does not have adequate
plumbing facilities. This we feel is simply horrible.

With these shameful conditions in mind, The Pitt News
must give its unequivocle support to the Poor People’s March.
The substandard conditions in Pittsburgh must be eliminated.
And we urege the University to do all in its power to aid the

' -necessary reconstrucion of standards in this city.

McCarthy
Blues

The Nebraska primary marks the second straight defeat for
presidential aspirant Senator Eugene McCarthy. It is stunning
defeat for the Minnesota Senator because this loss was incurred
in an agricultural state. Senator McCarthy was expected to do
3quite well in farm territory for he is himself from a farm state.
‘However, his accomplishments, in Nebraska were a great deal
less than his expectations.

The Senator did, in fact, poll 31 per cent of the Democratic
vote. This is indeed an improvement over his Indiana percent-
age. But when this figure is contrasted with the 51 per cent total
of Senator Robert Kennedy, the improvement seems next to nil.

In the McCarthy-Kennedy battle of the primaries, Senator
Kennedy has scored two straight victories. In his Nebraska vic-
1tory, the New York Senator recorded the first Democratic major-
._ity vote in this year’s primaries. This is quite a feat for a candi-
date in a four man race in a notably conservative, agricultural

state .

We feel that Kennedy’s “big win” in Nebraska will give his
campaign the push that it needed. The Senator was obviously
”quite pleased” with his impressive win and feels that the cam-
paigngroads in Oregon and California will be smooth ones. With
iprirnary wills in these states, the Senator will have a good shot
-at the Democratic Presidential nomination.

: On the other hand, Senator McCarthy’s campaign, for all
intents and purposes, has run out of gas. His campaign was
charged with a ground swell of idealism and it set new political
precedents. But a campaign that has suffered two successive de-
gfeats at-the hands of Bobby Kennedy and has noticeable finan-
cial difficulties, can not hope to compete with the Kennedy
-machine that has, by now, gained such momentum that it is vir-

L‘ .tually invinci.ble. -

It was raining late Wednes-
day night and Holland Hall
stood barren and cold.

It was raining very early
Thursday morning, but this
time Holland Ha1l’s black
smoke-stained structure seem-
ed alive. Its austere appear-
ance was warmed by the dor-
mitory room lights, switched
on by the new residents who
were spending the night there.
They were tired and they were
getting a good night’s sleep.

The rain had followed these
visitors for the past few days,
when they had stopped in De-
troit, Toledo. and Akron.

But now, as these visitors sat
waiting to board buses and to con-
tinue their trek. and as the rain
moved eastward toward the At-
lantic Coast, there was a change
in plans.

THEY LEARNED that they
would not be staying just one
night. They would be in Pitts-
burgh for three days. Their des-
tination had been _Washington,
D. C., but for the time being,
Pittsburgh would be home for
them.

They were poor people and they
were campaigning.

Some of them had come from
as far away as Los Angeles. Calif.
Others were from Chicago, De-
troit, Milwaukee. and other cities
in the north. They were 1,200,
mostly Black. and they represent-
ed the Midwest Caravan of the
Poor People’s March.

When they arrived in Pitts-
burgh, it was late Wednesday
night. They held a rally at the
Civic Arena. When they got here,

it was midnight. The middle age -

ones wanted a bed and sleep. The
youths wanted sonething to eat.

EVEN EARLY Thursday morn-
ing, when they waited with their
packed suitcases outside Holland
Hall, some were still tired. and
still hungry.

In th e Quandrangle. m a n y
youths were running around. Some
sang aloud; others played guitars.

Many wore sweatshirts; some

7 ,’ _had on berets, straw hatsgcowboy V

hats. or hard helmets like those
worn in the steel mills. Most of
them were the new jewelry,
chains hanging from their necks.
Stars. watches, chain loops. and
large religious medals were at the
end of the chains. Some wore but-
tons which said “Black and Beau-
tiful” or “Welfare Rights” or
“Soul Brother.”

They talked among themselves,
and usually didn’t like the bright
light of a Pittsburgh TV photo-
grapher. who was taking film
clipsgor the noon news.

THEY HAD “NO comment” or
“we have nothing to say, talk to
our leaders,” for questions put to
them. The youths wanted no inter-
ference from outsiders.

“If that cameraman tries to
take a picture of me, I’m going to
take that camera off him and
throw it to the ground,” said one
Black youth about 15-years-old to
a friend.

To passersby, the youths’ dress
and appearance may have seem-
ed militant. “But even the mili-
tant-looking ones,” said a white
student who was helping with
Pitt’s hospitality program. “are
very intelligent.”

“I was talking to some of
them,” she continued, “and though
they have dropped out of school.
they have good ideas and made
good grades.”

THE OLDER PEOPLE, though

 
 
 

they too would not comment on
the march, felt a little less sus-
picious about talking to strangers.

“We’re goin’ down to see LBJ
and all ‘dose big guys, and we’re
goin’ to tell them.” said a middle-
aged brown-skinned woman. who
wore glasses.

She was from Los Angeles.
“That’s the place,” she said.
“Palm trees . . . . . alot of cars
though.”

“One thing though.” she said.
shaking her fist, “when I stand
under those trees, I just say . . . .

. Ihave power . . . . black power.” .

Another younger woman, dress-
ed in a sweatshirt, dungarees, and
sneakers and sitting on her light
brown suitcase, was raving about
how she would never forget Pitts-
burhg’s hospitality. “We were
treated royally. Everything was
good. The police. The beds. The
food. I’ll never forget Pittsburgh
for this.”

“I REMEMBER YOU people
had trouble awhile back,” she
continued. “I hope there’s no
more. And I hope this Washing-
ton trip is peaceful. That’s all I
hope.”

And then she started joking
about .what she woulp do when
she arrived in-Washington. She
laughed so hard she fell off her
suitcase and then laughed even
louder.

Naval Controversy

Morse’s Evidence Reveals Tonkin Mockerv 

by PAUL STOLLER. Editor

Evidence in the public record
clearly cites a great many incon-

tortions concerning the adminis-

Tonkin incidents.

However. classified informa-
tion that was recently released to
the public by Senator Wayne
Morse in a Senate speech clearly
reveals that the second attack did
not occur. Unfortunately. this in-
formation has not been publicized
outside of its insertion in the Con-
gressional Record.

Senator Morse’s information
concerns some odd occurences
involving a third naval incident
in the Gulf of Tonkin—an incident
that was notably hushed up by the

Defense Department.

This hard hitting evidence was
taken from a detailed report of a
Naval Board of Inquiry that was
held after the confusing events
of the third incident were repor-
ted. Most Boards of Inquiry are
convened when naval incidents
elicit confusing inconsistencies.

The incident involved two U.
S. destroyers (the Morton and Ed-
wards) that were on an electronic
surveilance patron in the Gulf.
The Edwards reported that after
holding a number of radar con-
tracts it had opened fire. In the
ensuing engagment. the Morton
and Edwards fired 170 rounds of
five inch Shells Senator Morse
stated: “This attack. according to
the information’ we have received.
took place at night. but in con-
trast with the Maddox and Turner
Joy incident. under a half full
moon and scattered clouds of visi-
bility up to four miles. Thus the
third incident was quite similar
to the Maddox incident except
that the visibility was better.

 The formal board of inquiry

concluded that “although the Mor-
ton and Edwards had held many

 

radar contacts and had a running
battle with these contacts. the
ships had not been North Viet-
namese patrol craft."

"It is interesting to note." said
Senator Morse. “that no such for-
mal inquiry was conducted in the
case of the two incidents invol-
ving the Maddox and Turner Joy. "

The incident involving the Ed-
wards and the Morton provides a
parallel case to those of the Mad-
dox and Turner Joy. Both cases
reported confused radar contacts.
Both cases. moreover. occurred
at night. However. it is very iron-
ic that a board of inquiry was held

for one case and not the other.‘

It is disturbing that two very sim-
ilar incidents occured and that
one of them was judged not to
have taken place. Why wasn‘t a
formal board of inquiry held for
the incidents involving the Mad-
dox and Turner Joy? The answer
to this question remains clothed
in thd confines to classified infor-
mation.

One thing is certain. the United
States government acted with un-
paralleled haste in its retaliation
of North Vietnam. In the short

span of five hours. the adminis-
tration arbitrarily escalated the
war in Vietnam by attacking the
North. And today. the events dir-
ectly connected to that initial es-
calation are shrouded in the
clouds of doubt.

The unjustified actions of the
United States Government in the
Gulf was highlighted by the pass-
age of the Tonkin Gulf Resolu-
tion—a mockery of the legislative
process. It is a mockery for it was
railroaded through the Congress
without ample investigation of its
inception or its consequences.

If enthusiasm and drive are any indicated
of who the winners will be this Saturday at

Syracuse, coach Jim Banner’s tracksters just might

overpower the odds in the highly competitive Quad-
rangular Meet. Banner confidently says. “We’re go-
ing there to win. Our kids are fighters. There aren’t
many of them. but they’re tough.”

He continued in the same confident tone by say-
ing that he is extremely well pleased with the past
week of practices. Banner also commented that his
squad and the entire track program at the Univer-
sity is on a constantly improving level. although he
does realize that it takes a long time to rebuild a
track team.

of his squad. Banner knows that his thinclads must

Banner is impressed with Penn States balance.
“They're strong in the 100. the 200. the mile. the two

They're very well rounded. "he ramarked.

It will be an uphill fight all the way for the
tracksters. Banner indicated his team has no chance
in the polevault and discus, which indirectly indi-
cates the squad’s lack of depth. He believes that the
loss of Bob Mac Elhenny will be a vital factor. Mac
Elhenny has torn bendons and is probably out for
the season.

“It‘s difficult to take the place of a field man.
and it’s going to hurt our chances in the six events
that McElhenny usually entered“ said Banner.

Banner carries optimistic hopes for Bryant Sal-
ter. Jack Neyer. Chet Wojiechowski. Roger Holly

CMU Unbeaten

N etters Lose Marathon 5 -4

by MARTHA HARTLE

..Carnegie-ivlellon nipped the
netters 5-4 Wednesday after-

noon in a five-hour marathon
match. but not before Coach Ben
Pope‘s boys played the role of
spoilers of individual win streaks
or their Oakland neighbors.

John King handed Tartan Bad-

er Wahedi his first loss of the sea- -

son in a match that went three
sets. King dropped the first set

/ 6-3. but rallied to take the next

two 6-4.6-0. Wahedi. a freshman
at Carnegie. had won nine
straight perviously.

In doubles. Bill Nichols and
J. D. Lewis teamed up to defeat
Bob Lowe and Mike Smolens 6-1.
7-9.7-5. Lowe and Smolens had
previously gone undefeated for
17 straight matches.

There were two records, how-
ever, that the netters didn’t spoil.
In winning the match, CMU com-
pleted its first undefeated season
in its net history, while number
one man Salim Khan finished his
season undefeated as he downed
Bob Salembier 6-0, 6-2.

Khan. a senior. is a native of

Pakistan and it has been rumored
that he ma_y be playing on the
Davis Cup team for his home-
land.

“I don‘t know anything about Alleghney or Duquesne." admitted

Lewis. “but were going to try to
sweep the remaining seven games
of the season. " ‘

Lewis‘ optimish seems to have
come from the mitters torrid hit-
ting.

“Against Clarion, we were
down, 6-2, going into the eighth
inning,” explained Lewis, “but
we came back with four runs in
the eighth. Then Clarion scored
another run in their half of the
inning, but we came back again
with one run in the ninth innigg.
We just kept coming back to pull
it out.”

Lewis is particularly pleased
with the hitting of centerfielder
George McKenzie.

“McKenzie almost hit another
home run against Clarion." said
Lewis proudly. “He hit the ball
about 350 feet out. and it went

_ over the centerfielder’s head. But

that was just an ordinary fly ball
compared to the way he's been
hitting lately!" _

Oddly enough, however, the
mitters scored the winning run
without any hits. First basemen
Tom Smith opened the tenth inn-
ing with a base on balls, but was
forced at second base on Bobby
Kohl's ground ball.

terrupted by the Carnegie—Mel1on
coach. who directed several

Skyscraper U. Sanier won his
first set 6-3. but dropped the next
two 6-2. 6-1. ‘

Lewis and Stromp also dropped

trol and the set as well, 6-3.

I could have beaten him." com-
mented Lewis. who just complet-

Golfers Caught In Losing Streak,

Finish Last in Indiana Tournament

by ED CONLEY

The Golf Team saw some familiar faces at the Indiana In-

vitational Tournament. Wednesday The results were all too
familiar.

Every team entered in the tourney had already gone against Rex
Peery s golfers. and at the end of the day the Panthers were at the bot-

tom of the pack.

The defeat was harder for the
golfers because the championship
went to the host school. Indiana-
State (Pa. ). a squad that they ed-
ged just eight days before.

But since that win the duffers
have hit a rut. They have dropped
a 15‘/2-2‘/2 decision to Clarion and
have given two poor showings in

tournaments, the Easterns and
this latest loss.
Whats happened to them‘?

Peery answers. “I wouldn‘t know.
If I did know what was wrong.
I’d do something about it. “

Hand problems could have
something to do with the bad
scores. Pete Keller was’having a
bit of trouble gripping last week
and the team's captain. Rick Gol-
den. has felt pain in his hands

during the past few matches.

Also, dental student Bill Bryan,

who has been the most consistent

‘performer this spring, could not

MORNINGS AT SEVEN. . .AND
THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT

Any man who says morning is the best time of day is
either a liar or a meadow lark.

There is only one way to make morning enjoyable:
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to
make morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is
possible if you will follow three simple rules:

1. Shave properly.

By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don't use
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades.

I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive
until one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir-
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per-
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna
does not rasp and tug, yelling, “Hey, lookit me l” No, sir,
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per-
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It

shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.’

Why, you hardly know it's there, this well-bred Personna
blade, this paragon of punctilio.

Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker’s art, this
epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double-
edge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get
some.

2. Breakfast properly.

I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible
shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac-
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an
ample breakfast.

Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph-
omore at V'.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec-
tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor-
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would
not sustain him, so he had a ﬂitch of bacon, a clutch of
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.

 

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When

the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that
he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He
was, of course, immediately shot by a ﬁring squad. Today,
a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander
in Cleveland.

3. Read properly.

Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.

But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acid-.

making news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper-
the Home and Garden section, for example.

For instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant,
there is a delightful. column called “Ask Harry Home-
spun” which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and
many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and
answers:

Q: I am. thinking of buying some power tools. What
should I get first?

A: Hospitanlizatiion.

Q: How do you get rid of moles?

A: Pave the lawn.

Q: What is the best way to puta wide car in a narrow
garage?

A: Butter it.

Q: What do you do for elm blight?

A: Saltwater gargle and bed rest.

Q: What can I do for dry hair?

A: Get a wet hat.

(If you flunk, at least you'll be awake.)

Sure you‘ve used NoDoz to help you
stay awake the night before an exam.

- But have you ever thought of taking
NoDoz to m.ake yourself a little sharper
during the exam itself?

Well, maybe you should.

Let‘s say you‘re one of those guys
who doesn‘t have to cram like madthe
night before. (Even so, you‘re probably
not getting your usual amount of sleep.)

And let‘s say the morning of the big
exam, you find yourself heading for
class, kind of drowsy and unwound
and wondering if The Great Brain has
deserted you in the night.

What do you do?

You panic, that‘s what you do.

Or, if you happened to read this ad,
you walk coolly over to the water cooler
and wash down a couple of NoDoz, the

Exam Pill. And before long you‘re feel-‘
ing more alert and with it again.

You see, NoDoz helps bring you up
to your usual level of alertness, so you
don‘t just sit there in a fog; it‘s got what
it takes to help restore your perception,
your recall, and even your ability to
solve problems.

In fact, NoDoz contains the strongest
stimulant for your mind that you can
take without a prescription. Yet it‘s not
habit forming.

Okay, but what about the guy who
goofs off all term and has to jam every-
thing in the night before.

Are we saying NoDoz will keep him
from flaming out?

Nope.

We‘re just saying
he‘ll be alert and awake.

As he flunks.
