Mayor"s appropriations are granted.

A plan to use a “meter” maid” to enforce the parking
restrictions is ‘under study. The plaza meters will cost
ﬁve "cents per half—hour with a limit of four hours, and
will operate from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

The Bureau of Traﬁic Planning said the plaza meters
are not the complete solution to the Oakland parking
problem and other measures—like underground garages

The Oakland Chamber of Commerce in conjunc-
tion with the City are_strongly in favor of the pro-
gram which received a public hearing earlier this
year. Previously the University administration urged

‘ I that the rates be slashed, but the Mayor had request-
ed the standard parking charge.
Studies by the Bureau of Traffic Planning indicate
that each spot is only used by two cars a day.

riday Issue Features
 Free- Football Rosters

The Pitt News will begin this
Friday to increase its service to
students by publishing a third
issue for the week. Friday ‘is-
sues will . be published before
every home football game this
trimester, but starting in Janu-
ary, the'paper will be published
three times every week, on Mon-

' days, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

according to Matthew Swetonic,
editor. -

“The front ‘page ‘of each Fri-
day issue this term will contain
the only ‘free line-up students
will be able to get for the game,”
Swetonic revealed. “It will list

I , the names, positions, -weights,

years, and numbers for the play-
ers of both teams."

Swetonic believes that the idea
for the Friday issues, which he
and Business Manager Ralph ‘Al-
brigh_t_ devised this summer, will
be “the ﬁrst move toward the es-
tablishment of The Pitt News as
a daily at the University.”

“In _‘,_a—,university of this size, a
daily newspaper would be of
great beneﬁt to the student body,”

a Swetonic continued. “By this ad-

dition of an issue we feel we
will be paving the way for ad-
vancement in the near future.”
In addition to sports infor-
mation, the Friday issues will
contain. news, ' features and re-

; .  views of weekend activities of

general interest in Pittsburgh.

Flbats will have a 25 foot limit

entrance to the stadium. If ﬂoats
exceed 11 feet, protruding ‘parts
must be removable.

Applications were distributed to

Cheerleaders

Fraternity and sorority mem-
bers will substitute as cheerlead-
ers .for the football game ' with
Washington on Saturday.

Since the cheerleaders will not
be able_ to attend the game because
of the Jewish high holy day, Yom
Kippur; and, since, in the words
of Mark . Bebko, Interfraternity
Council, president, “no one else on
campus would take this over, I
decided to ask permision for the
Greeks to take over cheering.”

Beth Baumgart, head cheerlead-
er, gave her approval, and Bebko
explained to IF that it would be
senseless to work up‘ some spirit
by having a practice pep rally if
there were no one to lead the
cheers at the game. He called it
“another small example of how
the Greeks contribute to the Uni-
versity when no one else will.”

Six Girls Cheer

The six girls who will cheer
are: Lee Delich, Alpha Delta Pi;
Aylene Harper, Kappa Alpha
Theta; Martina Thomas, Kappa

‘Kappa Gamma; Gerry Hendricks,

Delta Sigma Tau; Jane Schoﬁeld,
Delta Zeta, and Carole Wilson,
Delta Delta Delta.

Representing fraternities, will
be Chuck Gularson, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, and Mark Bebko,
Phi Kappa Theta.

All the girls ,,who will cheer
were ﬁnalists in the cheer—leading
tryouts last year. Theyhave been
practicing for the past two weeks.
“We hope to know six cheers and
a couple of dances,” Bebko ex-
plained.

The date for the Greek practice
pep rally has been changed to
October 1 at 6:15 p.m.

SUB   To Sponsor

Afternoon Dances ,

Dances, sponsored by the Stu-
dent Union Board Social commit-
tee, will be held in» the SU Ball-
room after every home ‘football
game except the Homecoming
game. _

Chairman .of the SUB Social
committee, Myra Adler, stated
that the dances would last until 6
p.m. and that no admission would
be charged.

Music ‘ will be provided by
guest bands such as the Del Rays
who will entertain Saturday. _

The committee will ‘also spon-
sor the showing of ﬁlms of the
away football game every Wed-
nesday at 8:30 p.m. in the Student

NASA Center Expanded  

By FERNE PITT

One feature of the new NASA
(National Aeronautics and Space
Administration) Space Research
and Coordination Center permits
graduate students in the Depart-
ment of Earth and Planatary Sci-
ence to work on a joint program
with Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology. V ' - ‘

The program was Announced
this summer and put into effect
this trimester. Professor A. F.
Frederickson is chairman of this
newly named department, former-

ly the Department of Geology.

Students will be able to earn a

degree at, either school while tak-

ing courses from both institutions

on the graduate level. This will

afford the student the opportunity

of working with both faculties

and sharing in the joint research
study being conducted.
Joint Projects

Dr. David Halliday, Dean of the

Natural Sciences, and acting di-

rector" of the new space program

stated, “We-expect, as a result of

this, that joint research projects
will be conducted between the
two institutions. It is a trend we
hope to encourage.”

The Space Research and Co-
ordination Center specializes in
study in the natural and so-
cial sciences, engineering and
health «areas associated with the
aerospace ﬁeld. The center will
be located in a new building
connected to Thaw Hall. The
‘building plans have already
been drawn and will be up for
bidding‘ this December.

Since I Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s-*an-
nouncement last January of an
across-the—boar_d expansion of a
space related’research program,
the project has successfully nego-
tiated. for a $500,000 research
grant from the‘ NASA.

Additional Grant

This is in addition to the $180,-
000 grant the University received
last year for ten three-year pre-
doctoral traineeships. Thus far, 11
pre-doctoral and ten doctoral fel-
lows have been appointed in the
space program. — _

The faculty recruiting pro-

. gram has been divided into two
.-phases according to Halliday.
The ﬁrst phases began ‘last year.
when ten appointments were
authorized in '.the ﬁelds of na-
tural science and engineering.
Five of these positions are cur-
rently ﬁlled by_ leading men in
the ﬁeld.

DR. DAVID HALLIDAY
‘Trend . . . to Encourage’

- the city and Western Pennsylvania

The second phase began thiil
summer with the authorization o‘,

ten more faculty appointments.
These latter ten appointees will
work mostly in the ﬁeld of’ en-
gineering with a few in the na-
tural science and one in the social
sciences.
Affected by Space Travel
Halliday explained that space
travel will directly affect, man’s
perspective on earth and the social
scientist would explore. this ﬁeld.
The new faculty appointees
are assigned to speciﬁc depart-
ments rather than to the space
program itself.

' The space program is admini-
stered by an advisory council con-
sisting of seven faculty members
headed by Dr. Halliday.

Preliminary contacts have been
made for local industries to work
with the University on space re-
lated problems. It is felt that this
program will encourage new in-
dustry in Pittsburgh and establish

as one of the major space centers
-of the nation.

Intermarriage: 2 . . .

. College Climax

By Matthew Swetonic

{country at any time in the near future, it will probably do so,in the
yinany institutions of higher learning where there are‘ students from

‘large number of faiths represented and where these faiths do not
=constitute only a fractional percentage of the total student enroll-i

nt. -

For example, I was told last week by Reverend Paul Schrading
,0! the campus minestry that the University’s religious distribution
gis approximately 30 per cent each Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish. -
“: what might be considered the ideal situation for such a climax.

_ _= How anything can_ come of such a distribution depends upon
 he premise that learned students think things out for themselves.
i"Of"-course, not all college students acquire this knack while in school,
‘but a. certain percentage ultimately realize that there can be little
reconciliation between the particular aspect of. religion in question
.. andthe workings of the rational mind. '-

" Religious arguments against inter-faith marriage, i.e. loss of
;;faith and improper upbringing of offspring, are unsound and are
' ased upon the baseless-belief that all other religions except one’s
.own are evil. I . .

 Similarly, the social arguments of loss of status, rupture of
arental ties, and rejection of religious background, are alien to the
ihleory of progress through the cross-cultural exchange of values
; and ideas. ' .

j ‘ here are, in addition, thre'e~attitudes peculiar to college which
‘.help foster the drive toward a more liberal view concerning inter-b
faith marriage. . " . ‘ '
« Most college students learn in their freshman year that it is
ndt-smart socially to be zealous about religion. In fact, the more one
leans toward atheism or agnosticism the better. .

 Whether this refutation of religion is merely brought on
“a yearning for identiﬁcation with the group or whether it is sincere
‘and has been arrived at through a careful investigation of the facts
is ofino importance. The fact still remains that -a large percentage of
;the college population is suspicious toward religion. .

Coupled "with this is the feeling of independence from parental
control which is a by-product of college. An individual placed on
,his own questions the right of his parents to again interfere in his

life-

 

When a man who is suspicious of religion and considers himself
independent of parental authority contemplates marriage to one of
another faith, his immediate response to any attempt on the part
of spiritual leader or parent to dissuade him from such a match is
to completely disregard their protests. M .
‘ Unfortunately, family ties in two cases often prevail over other
instincts, and disappointment, unhappiness, and dispair is the. result.
More lifetime atheists are created through situations of this sort
than through the systematic rejection of the principles of religion.

‘ However, it is still in the colleges of this countrythat much
' —of the hope for a reversal of situation must center, for reason com-

bined with love is a tough combination to beat.

  Professional Loafers

The Federal Government’s Department of
Public Assistance has raised a new breed in the
United States. The members of this new breed
have no higher ambition than to loaf.

After all, why should they work when they can
collect checks while sitting home watching TV.

Why should they work for $40 weekly when
they get 35. for doing nothing?

Supposedly, a person ca
only go on relief when there i
no » work for him. "But gettin
proof of no work is no harde
for the reliefer than crawling i
for a worm. All they have to d
is obtain a signed statemen
from a potential employer tha
there is‘ no work for them-.

Employers have little alter
native but to sign the statement
If an employer offers to hire the
person‘, the would-be reliefer simply seeks ‘out
another’ employer. Through this, the first em-
ployer earns the reputation of somewhat of an
ogre for not letting the reliefer collect his 35
dollars. ‘ E

“I have no choice but to sign those. state-
ments,” one [merchant reported. “Those people
are my customers. If I don’t sign it, they won’t
come back to the "store, and neither will their
friends. Nobody can afford to lose business.”

People on relief get an increase in their allow-
ance if they have children, so a reliefer with two
children has an income that amounts to about
$1.50 an hour for the 40 hour work week he
didn’t work. ' '

Of course, there are shortcomings to this type
of freeloading. After a certain amount of time on
relief, the government assumes ownership of any
landthe reliefer might own.

But, the industrious reliefer has found, away

   
  
  
 
  
  

By Marvin Zelkowitz

out of this dilemma. He simply sells his house
and moves into a low rent aparement.

M Also, a person on relief may not work without
giving up his checks. This cuts down on the op-
portunity to do something industrious during his
spare time. ' '

He gets around this in several ways. Many
reliefers have part-time jobs 30 or 40 miles from
-their home, so the local relief board will not see
him working- Otherwise they try to ﬁnd jobs
inside private homes, where they can’t be seen
working. , ,

About a year ago there seemed to be a remedy
to the relief problem. The State Legislature
even passed a bill that would require the reliefer
to do a certain number of hours of work per
week in order to collect his checks.

The reliefer already has a" remedy to this
problem. “They_’ll never get me to work,” one
reliefer said. “I’ll get a doctor to write out a
note for me saying that I’m too sick to work.
Then they’ll have to ‘give me my cheeks, anyway.”

So, the reliefer has found an excuse for every
method so far devised to get him to work.

In some families, being on relief is somewhat

. of a tradition. There are cases in Western Penn-
sylvania where there are third generation‘ re- ~

liefers. These people haven’t had a regular\ job
since DPA was ﬁrst introduced.

These people are a burden on every American
taxpayer. Few realize that part of each tax dol-
lar they pay to the government goes to support
..these people who refuse to work-. '

The reliefer gets as much for sitting home as
a clerk does in a dry. goods store. i

The next time you meet a little boy on the
street, ask him what he wants to be when he

grows up. If he tells you he wants to be a pro- ‘

fessional reliefer,‘ chances are he won’t mean the
baseball kind. A

Editorial On Ad Hoc
Viewed As Sarcastic 1.
‘Editor, The ‘Pitt. News:

Allow me to congratulate you
‘on .5 magniﬁcent piece of ‘sar-
casm. I refer, of course, to your
editorial, “To Do the Most
Good.” , '

If you spent as much time
pointing out the" importance ‘of
equality, "as you ‘spend in criti-
cism, the ‘job of the Ad Hoc
Committee would be that much

easier. However, you seem to be ,-

set on creating the impression
that the Ad Hoc Committee ‘is
really just ‘a poorly organized
group made up from ‘poorly
oriented individuals.

So far as the Committee’s

bringing the ‘University to a.

state_ of discrimination con-
sciousness is concerned, this in

itself is an important contribu-'

tion. This is, especially true in
light of the fact that so many
people at the University do not
even believe that prejudice and
discrimination exist in the North.

An evil cannot be combated
if it is not known that the evil

‘‘ exists.

I often wonder who does the
most damage to the ﬁght for
equality —- the outright bigot,
or the so-called “conservative”
who sits, back and makes little
snide remarks and insists upon
treating all those who would
seek equality as children who
must be tolerated. ‘ '

Allow me to assure you, sir,
that equality is no longer a mat-
ter to be treated lightly or ig-
nored 'in the hopes that the idea
will go away.

You imply that Ad Hoc Com-
mittee is m or e interested in
glory than acc0mplish_ment. A1-

a‘’ e m-.~a,n:y A.educate,d-... Negroes

_.low. me to point" out». that there

 
    
  

cannot get their
cut in certain barber shops,
nor eat in certain restau-
rants. You fail to recognize the
fact that we are not interested
in only educating the Negroes,
we are interested in obtaining
for him equal -rights in every
aspect. What good is it to be
educated if you cannot ﬁnd em-v
plofywient in your ﬁeld, cannot
buy a home where you chose
and cannot do the. things that
white people do? 

The ﬁght for equality is a
ﬁght for total equality and all
segments are part of a larger
whole. Only when the Negro
can get the _ same education,
shop in the same stores, hold
the same jobs, aspire to the
same political offices, and yes,
get his hair cut in the same
shop, will he be free.

To borrow a few of your
words — there is not as much
glory in ﬁghting for" equality as
in attacking the efforts of those
.who do ﬁght, _but it is certainly
a greater and more lasting ac-
complishment. ‘

Mark well my words, sir, the
day of equality is soon to be
a reality ' and’ not even_ your
great gift of sarcasm cant stop it.

Column On Pittsburgh
Attacked'With Vigor

Editor, The Pitt News:

I want simply to say that
Mr. St‘ein’s article "on Pittsburgh,
the “pseudo-cultural city” re-
vealed a complete lack of under-
standing of either the city or its
people: he does not seem at all
aware that he is here dealing

-with the ‘largest’ small town in
,Ameri,ca.''_ ‘ ' i ' "

     
  

\

. dium,

‘terms of_ what is, not merely

in terms of what «you see as
“city.” There is no “cultural re-
birth”
are some very beautiful things
happening here — but there
never was this thing to be born
again.

At best, this is a city of ma-
tu_re children: and therein lies
its beauty, and my love. Its
museums stand empty and the
exhibits rarely change and the
guards sleep at their posts -—-
while thousands of people
scream enormous respect for a
ball team that can barely play
the game. ' _

.Mr. Stein: understand why
these people act as though you
are stealing their children when
it appears there may be not sta-~
the Pirates may leave;
understand how ,an entire city
can wrap its life around the fate
of .three miners, so wrap its
life that every new move, every
added inch dug, every new
chance at saving the men, be-
came headline interest for over
twenty days —— and you will
understand why [your articles
seemed. to me so much _like a
Christian bringing his truth to
the jungle. Children, too, have
a right to choose their toys.

Also, and this is a bit more
personal, I noticed, Mr. Stein
was so caught up in the truth of
the “article,”' in the form of
things — he went on to ﬁll out
his space with a’ rude, irreverent.
description of the physical antics
of Bernstein and Ozawa. But
then, Mr. Stein certainly has the
right to play as he chooses with
the toys of his choice. Perhaps
there is still hope for. him; per- _
haps he, too, is something of a
child.

  In The Spotlight

With Stan Schweiger

 

;__ _f_<. The British and European in-
vasion of Broadway, so successful
the past two years, continues at
full steam into the 1963-64 theat-

_ rical season. There is no slacken-
ing oif of quality imports seen in
the near future, and there is good
reason to justify this new cultural
war. , ‘

America’s giants of the theatre

ﬁre disappearing like buffalo into
gaethe Lincoln Center program or
into the 20 mile radius that has
become known as Off-Broadway.

Included among the giants of the

passing era who .can’t seem to
compete with the invaders from
abroad are Tennessee Williams,

Arthur, Miller, and S. N. Behr-

man. .

The latter two are Lincoln Cen-
tered, while Williams is reviving

"""Anymore for off-Broadway. Li-
lian Hellman’s last, play was an
immense ﬂop. Ditto for William
Inge. '

Odets has passed on under
reams of saint-like eulogizing.
Arthur Laurents would rather
become rich by writing music-—
als. American audiences are
growing wary of their own and

,, only a “New Breed” (if the
“’‘‘fv N.Y. Mets will permit the theft)
consisting of Ed Albee and
Lorraine Hansbury shows signs
of catching on. ‘
Aside from the creators of mu-
sical comedies and their sure—ﬁre
commercial products, the United

serious and dedicated playwrights.
And so to Great Britain and her
__ -Yneighboring Common Marketeers
"M has fallen the great task of ﬁlling
Broadway houses with meaningful
and ‘thought-provoking theatre.
Important producers such as
‘David Merrick and Robert White-
‘; head are journeying
c“"e“* abroad in order to
l"‘P°”5 lure the bests- of
Britain and Europe to the Great,
White Way.
Arnold Wesker, Terence Ratti-
. u§~gan, and John‘Osborne will have
V‘ . openings on Broadway very short-
, ly. And the likes of Robert Bolt,
Sheilah Delaney, Brendon Behan

rent imports who are leading the
new invasion. Not to mention
Ionesco, Anouilh, Giradoux and
the amazing Brechtian resurgence.
Even the _musical theatre of
Newley, Bart, and\ Coward. is
gaining preference over our own
musical creators. Only Richard
Rodgers is in greater demand
by producers, but Mr. Rodgers
avoids trouble and produces his
own creations.
.Why have our audiences de-
‘ manded the overseas product? Why
have they rejected the “home-
grown” product? A good answer,
or, rather a suggestion, is that we
'L‘have lost faith in what -Americans
as playwrights can produce. We
/" ‘do notlike failure on the stage
and there is a great apprehensive-
ness when a playwright tries to
come back after’ a flop.

The apprehensiveness lies with
the audiences, who don’t want to

have lightning strike them twice,

and the producers, who must be
ever-cautious, as their making a
living is at stake, along with their
reputation.

Lately the rule of thumb has
shown that since people such as
Hellman and Williams have
fared poorly, it is time to turn
our heads and paychecks to the
thriving E u r o p e a n gardens
brimming over with gorgeous
gardenias, resilient roses and
precious petunias.

Another suggestion couldbe the
fact that an import oﬁers an audi-

These items, when fused success-
fully, compliment the originality
and meaningfulness of said im

Everything foreign is the suc-
cessful trend nowadays because
producers are buying the already
well-tested European p r o d u c t s,
These shows were well received
abroad and are “sure-things” for
our audiences. The new exciting
offer a marked contrast to the
familiar and static, and here we
have what seems to be the main
idea to justify the success from
abroad. ’

I could probably list a million
suggestions in order to support
this “theatrical war.” I will not
because it might be embar-
rassing to those who champion
the cause of the American play-
wright. Now with a new theat-
rical season just ahead, the
panic button has been pushed.

American playwrights are fur-
iously pounding their_ typewriters
in hopes of getting their work pro-
duced in the near future.‘ They
will try to combat ‘the surging
armies from the European theatre.

A war of deﬁnite sorts is taking
place on the theatrical scene. Who
will win? Hopefully, the Ameri-
cans will come down the home
stretch and triumph by a “knows.”

Until the time when our play-
wrights can come up with the
fresh, the invigorating, and the

ropean combatants, our cultural
loss, plus a European victory will
be Broadway’s gain. ~

area residents.

Commentingion the large num-
ber of volunteers, Mrs. Jean
Mygat, executive secretary of
PCIV, said, “The volunteers make
a great many experiences possible
for foreign visitors which would
otherwise not be ‘available. Be-
sides, the volunteers insist that
they (the volunteers) -— through
lasting friendships and new
knowledge — receive more from
PCIV activities than the visitors.”

108 Countries Represented

Over 1740 people representing
108 countries and territories have
taken advantage of PCIV oppor-
tunities since its founding. These
opportunities include orientation
to the United States, visits with
American families, special events,
and linking Oﬁice of Cultural and
Educational Exchange
with the community.

This year, orientation, in the
form of ,pre-registration hos-
pitality was offered to about 70
new foreign students of the
University, Chatham College,
Carnegie Tech and Duquesne
University. After arriving in
Pittsburgh about two weeks be-
fore classes, the students are
“adopted” by American families
in this area. __

Through this program, students
can become oriented to America’s
people, pace and climate before
facing the demands of a different
educational ‘system.

American Women Help

foreign students meet American
women with children of similar
ages. These Americans then help
the foreign wives to settle and to
meet members of the community
who share similar interests.

 Michelosen Emphasizes Offense

In Early Grid Practice Sessions

By AL BLUMKIN
“We still have nine games
to go,” said coach John Mich-

elosen as the Panthers foot-

ballers returned to practice

« Monday for the ﬁrst session

after the ﬁne 20-0 triumph

over the UCLA. Bruins Friday
night at the Los Angeles Col-
iseum.

_'The practice session was de-

voted mainly to the running of
offensive plays against the de-
fense of this week’s opponent,
the University of Washington.
The gridders also worked to keep
the offensive blocking at the
razorsharp edge which was pre-
valent in the UCLA victory.
Michelosen was extreme-
ly pleased with the ‘victory and
t-herelative ease by which it was
accornplished. He stressed the
spirit of the team. “They really
wanted to play,” he said. “There
was tremendous spirit on the

. ﬁeld. I think we can keep-it up.”

Mazurek Passes Well -

- A ,The passing of Fred Mazurek
, ',and Kenny Lucas hadia lot to
‘do with the victory. The Pan-

thers completed 16 of 28 passes

for 227 yards, an average of
" eight yards per attempt which

compares favorably with several
professional teams. The 28 passes
were the - most thrown by the

A Panthers since -the Miami game

last year. “This time, however,
we were more successful,” said
Michelosen. .

One surprise was the use of
Frank Novak for most of the
second half. Novak played the
-entire fourth quarter. “We

wanted to give everyone a
chance to play,” .Michelosen
said, “and there was no sense
in risking injury to Mazurek
or Lucas in» that stage of the
game.” '

The Panthers also picked up
202- yards on the ground. Ma-
zurek was the rushing leader with
49 yards in 7 carries. Close be-
hind him were Eric Cra-btree
with 44 in eight, Rick Leeson
with 41 in 11, and Paul Martha
with 34 -in 4. '

Punting Weak

One weakness stands out in
the overall picture, however,
‘and could prove serious. The
punting by fourth-string quar-

terback Tom Black was wholly

inadequate. He averaged 24.3
yards on three boots.
Washington, coached by Jim

' Owens, is the only West Coast

team to win two Rose Bowls
against Big Ten ‘opposition.

The Huskies come here with’

a 0-1 record, having lost to the
Air Force, 10-7, in a major up-
set. Last year, Washington was
7-1-2, losing only to national

champion Southern California.

The Huskies are expected to
show a highly touted defense.

They will have ‘ample oppor-

tunity to prove their mettle Sat-
urday when they battle the re-
vamped Panther offense.

Cub F ullbacks ‘Eye ,:Varsity Spots

By FRED BERLIN
In order for any football
team to present a balanced at-
tack it must possess a strong

fullback. T h i s
keeps the de-

 
 
 

end plays to
develop. This
season's C ub
squad is plac- 
ing the burden 

on only two
players.

offers and was one of last season's
most prized prospects.
Although both boys can go

either way Randour stated that
he prefers defense. As is custom-
ary for fullbacks most of their
running will be done through the
center of the line.
-Flanigan Likes Track
Besides being an outstanding
gridiron star Flanigan also holds
a number of track honors. In his
senior year at West Miﬁlan North
High School he became one of the
top shot putters in the state. He
would like to resume that sport
here.
Randour, on the other hand,
prefers basketball as a. second
interest. He stated, “I’d like to
play, but I’m not sure right now.

   

It all depends on hiw my grades
turn: out." .  . _ ,7  _ .

 

Coach Bill - Kaliden maintained
his customary tight lipped policy
in commenting on who might start
for the Cubs. “Both are good,”
he remarked. “I:'d say that as far
as blocking is concerned they are
pretty equal.”

According to Rees, Kent is in
the, process of building a team and
should provide little competition
for the Pantherh. On the other
hand Ohio should prove to be
almost as tough as last year.'In
1962 the Bobcats won the Mid-
Atlantic Conference Champion-
ship and placed sixth -in the
NCAA meet.

. Real Solid Team
“This is the ‘ﬁrst time in ﬁve
or six years that we’ve had a
real solid team,” Rees stated.
‘,‘Plus having one or two men that
can win almost any race, we
have an additional four that are
a real threat in that they ‘could
possibly move into one of the top
positions on the team.” V

$3:{Iopes for Bowl Bid
0 Halfback Bill Bodle
,__Looks for Big Year

By ART FLEISCHNER

Bill Bodle, the Panthers starting right halfback, has only
one question about this year’s team: What bowl will it go to

-7.

_»_,r~ practice

-—

.~_ 4‘

at the. end of the season?

This is not to imply that Bodle is cocky. Heiis quite the
opposite. He isjust conﬁdent in this year’s team and in him-

we have to do is use it.”

Bodle is 6-feet tall and weighs 

187-pounds. Although he hasonly
average speed, his serious attitude
about the game is a large asset.

Must Improve Blocking
“I must work on my blocking,"

said Bodle. “And I am not satis-

ﬁed with my cutting. I have to

it until
natural.”

The right halfback position is
not new to the junior physical
education major. “In high
school I played fullback, and
when I was a freshmanhere I
played fullback and both half-

__backs.
“It’s hard to switch from one
position to another. The funny

ffathing about it is that it’s even ,
‘harder to switch back. But I’m

not sorry that Martha had to
make the change,” said Bodle.
‘ Knows Plays Better

“If he had stayed at right half,
I might still be on the second
team. Every guy wants a ‘chance
to start. The big difference be-
tween this yearandlast is that I

know the plays better. I know
4'“ where the guard is going and

where the hole will be. I'm not
running blindly,” Bodle continued.

Bodle is one of the few foot-
ball players from out of state.
He played at Highland Park
High School in Deerﬁeld, Illi-.
nois, under John Chickerneo.
Chickerneo played at Pitt in the
same backﬁeld with Marshall
Goldberg.

-L“ “John is the main reason I’m
" here,” said Bodle. “He told me

about the school. "I came here to
see it, liked it, and decided to
enroll. ‘
Will Consider Pros _
“As far ‘as .my future goes, I
would .like to do what John is
doing now; If I get any pro offers,
ﬁne. But I’m just going to wait
and see.”

Fraternities
Battle for Title

By FRANK SMIZIK

Phi Epsilon Pi and Delta Sigma
Phi continued to lead the Frater-
nity A Softball League with iden-
tical 4-0 records. Phi Ep clobbered
Sigma Alpha Mu 17-3 and Delta

Sig ‘edged Pi Lambda Phi 12-10.‘

Phi Ep combined a lusty hitting
attack with sharp ﬁelding to gain
their victory. Bob Levine led the
attack with three hits —- one a
homer, and ﬁve runs battedin.
Carl Kaplan and Rick Rogow also
came through with three hits.

George Prussin was the ﬁelding

_star as he caught a line drive that

was bombed to center ﬁeld while
running with his back to the dia-
mond. Pitcher Bob Schacter con-
tinued his excellent form by re-
tiring 13 men in order at one time
and only giving up one earned
run.

_ Lose Second Straight

Delta Sig came from behind in
the seventh inning to give Pi Lam
their second straight loss. Delta
Sig lost their right ﬁelder Nick
Cermelli‘ who was injured in the
fourth inning on a close. play at
the plate.

Cermelli suffered a fractured
jaw and possible concussion as a
police ambulance was summoned
to carry him off the ﬁeld.

John Pignetti and Ralph Cap-
jpy were the batting leaders for
the Delta Sigs as they managed
three hits apiece. Both got
clutch hits in the ﬁve run sev-
enth when Delta Sig went
ahead. .

Phi Ep and Delta Sig will meet
next week to decide the. cham-
pionship.' There is no chance for
a tie as it will be the last game
for both teams. Pi Lam lost their
chance for a tie for ﬁrst when they
lost td Delta Sig.

Soccer Team Blessed  

With Three Goalies

This season the Panther soccer team is blessed with three
capable goalies. According to the three, the position of net
tender on a soccer team amounts to much more than making

spectacular stops on fast-break plays and being battered by "'~

hard shots on goal.

“A good goalie,” said varsity co-captain Tom Staab, “is . A

fairly tall, agile, sort of wiry, has¢

to be able to handle the ball like
a basketball or baseball player,
and should have a good foot (for
punts).” _

“He should be able,” said Ken
Lang, who is now ﬁlling in for the
injured Staab,” to make snap de-
cisions, to move quickly, and to
have a_good sense of judgment.”
Ron Mitchell added,, “A good
goalie should have the ability to
bounce back after a big mistake.”

‘ Three Step Strategy

“As to goalie strategy,” said
Staab, _\“the pattern I usually use
consists of three steps: First, to
make sure every defensive man
covers his offensive ‘assignment.
Second, to try to break up.oﬂ:‘en-
sive plays as far away from the
goal as possible.

“Third, to protect yourself at
all times even if it means play-
ing the ball and man at the
same time.".

All three feel the fact that they
“don’t have to run a lot” is an ad-
vantage of playing goalie. Lang
gets the “greatest satisfaction out
of stopping a big center forward«

from scoring,’-’ and Mitchell espe- ’
cially likes “‘to try’ to outguess the j
other man and try to stop penalty V

shots.” ‘
_ Lang said the hardest play for
‘a goalie is the one-on-one situa-
tion. a
Coach Leo Bemis said that the
only thing separating the three

is experience. He feels they’ all‘.

are properly attuning their play
in accord with the ball-control
style of the team; they are em-
ploying accurate throws mixed
with some long punts when

clearing the ball out of the goal 4  ff: ’

area.

Staab’s last remark concerned if

a misfortune that all goalies .must’
-face. “Every mistake a goalie
makes,” he said, \“is rung up on
the scoreboard.”

 

IVAN TONCIC holds every Pitt 0

record for touchdown passes with
17 for a career, eight for one
season, and four in one game.
