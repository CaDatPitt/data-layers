Pitt makes a difference

 Mbadija .is;g.e:1sh...g..p;;..

Pitt students engaged in community service in South Oakland as part of Pitt’s annual Pitt Make a Difference Day on Saturday.

Katherine Sandler
For The Pitt News

If the bright, neon-yellow T-shirts didn’t wake
up the Pitt Make A Difference Day volunteers
on Saturday morning, than the free 12—oz.
energy drinks handed out by the Red Bull
girls probably did.

Several thousand students woke up early ,

to participate in the third annual volunteer
event that sent students all over Pittsburgh
to pick up trash, tend green spaces and con-
duct other service duties. After the 8:30 a.m.
check—in and a brief delay while organizers
put together volunteer groups, 59 buses es-
corted students to various local communities
while two groups stayed in Oakland.

' ' Together, the volunteers dedicated more

than 9,000 hours to cleaning up various

neighborhoods around Pittsburgh.

One bus, number 42, was scheduled to
depart for the Southside Flats at 9:15 a.m., but
students on the bus didn’t reach their destina-
tion until a few minutes before 10 a.m.

Bus 42’s mission was simple: Clean up
litter between 21st and 25th streets.

Cathy Mitchell, a member of South Side P

Community Council and head of Green n’at,
a community—b eautifying effort, met the vol-

~ unteers at the intersection of Wharton and

22nd streets.

‘ Mitchell divided the clean-up area into 10
zones so the volunteers could cover ground
more quickly. Roughly eight groups of ﬁve
participants each spanned the f1ve—block

stretch, and a designated “team captain”
marked on his map all the vacant lots and
green spaces the team was able to clean.

The largest group took on a set train tracks
and a supermarket parking lot nearby. Fresh-
men Rachel Mauer and Erika Frick kept the
group members entertained as they worked
by freestyling to LMFAO’s hit song “Shots.”

The group remained lighthearted during
the work. Freshman and group captain Lukas
Earhart said, “The sector was clear but we did
lose good men to the GE parking lot.”

Later, as some of the troops turned down
an alleyway, they were nearly blinded. The
side street resembled the quintessential
Christmas morning that every toddler envi-

schedule

Staff Writer

Come winter — well, come spring '— Pitt stu-
dents will be able to enjoy a new green space
right by campus, if only for a little while.

Workers will replace the DeSoto Building
on Fifth Avenue, which used to hold UPMC’s
Children’s Hospital, with a landscaped lawn
area by the middle of December. UPMC plans
to replace the plaza with another building in
a few years. _

Deconstruction of the DeSoto Building was
supposed to be completedby Oct. 15, according
to Tom Schwartzmier, senior project manager
of planning, design and construction at UPMC
Shadyside. Now, that deadline has been moved
to the middle of December. . '

The plaza is planned to be a grass lawn with

seating and streetlamp lighting. Schwartzmier _

said it will be similar to Schenley Plaza but on
a slight slant, since the DeSoto Building was

‘ builtonahill.

The completion of the plaza’s construction
was delayed because of early complications in-
volving asbestos removal. -

Susan Manko, a spokeswoman for UPMC,
said that everything is now going according to
the new schedule. “We hope to have [the proj-
ect] completed by the end of the year, and at
that time we can prepare the land for a green
space,” she said. '

When the deconstruction is complete, con-
struction workers will begin laying out grass

Pitt might cap next year’s tuition increases
at 4 percent if it gets more money from
the state legislature.

The University has increased its re-
quest for state funding by 5 percent for
the next ﬁscal year. The request, sent late
last month to the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Education, asked for a total of
$194.1 million next year. Pitt received
$184 million for this year.

The request also said that Pitt would

increaseits salaries by 3 percent next
year. ~ .- . .. '  l

- Pittspokesman John ~Fedele;said that
it is “impossible” to‘ calculate how much
tuitionrmilght go up next year until the

exact amount the University will receive

is clear. '

“The University will do everything in
its power to minimize tuition increases,”
he said.

The level of state funding Pitt receives _
has grown almost every year for the past '

15 years,yaccsording to the~University’s
fact bobk. But Pitt’sibudget has ‘more than
doubled in that time, and the state ap-

Local songwriter recognized

Stephen Foster inducted into the songwriters hall of fame

Emily Riley

For The Pitt News >

Pittsburgh native Stephen Foster, widely re-
garded as the ﬁrst professional songwriter,
was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters
Hall of Fame on Sunday. ‘ -
The Nashville Songwriters Foundation
chose to honor Foster, along with three other
musicians, forwriting “remarkable songs that
we’ve lived our lives by through the years.”
The foundation typically inducts only three
individuals per year. '

According to its website, “The Nashville “

Songwriters Hall of Fame is a nonproﬁt orga-
nization dedicated to honoring and preserving
the songwriting legacy that is uniquely associ-
ated with the Nashville music community.”

Kathryn Miller Haines, the associate direc-
tor of the Center for American Music at the
University of Pittsburgh, cited a few reasons
why Foster is still earning recognition nearly
150 years after his death.

“His importance continued far past his
death. Especially more recently, a lot of his
music has been showcased,” she said.

Since his death, Foster’s music has been fea-
tured in a Broadway musical called “Beautiﬁil
Dreamer,” and Haines said his music has been
the focus of a scholars’ conference.

More recently, Bruce Springsteen covered
one of Foster’s songs during an encore of one
of his shows.

“It seems that the Hall of Fame found it
necessary to induct him while the rest of the

music world was recognizing him as well,”
Haines said.

Foster wrote famous songs such as “Oh!
Susanna” and “Camptown Races.” Along with
recognizable western tunes, Foster also con-
tributed to the acceptance of songwriting as
a serious career.

“Without him,” Haines said, “songwriters
would be -not be compensated the way they
are today. He was the ﬁrst to make music his
sole vocation.”

Pitt honored Foster’s career and contribu-
tion to the music industry in 1937 with the
official dedication of the Stephen Foster Me-
morial Museum, according to the Center for
American Music’s website. _

Students found it appropriate that Foster
is still being recognized. .

“Wow, he is in pretty company in that Hall

of Fame, withjohnny Cash and Roy Orbison,”
said Pitt student Andrew Clifford. “We should,
as students, recognize this induction because
not only is he a Pittsburgh native, but a great
American songwriter.”
, Another Pitt student,J.D. Schroeder, agreed.
“I would say his songs are a part of American
folklore. Fweryone is familiar with his songs
and to say a Pittsburgh native put something
like that out there, it’s kind of like Pittsburgh’s
contribution to American culture.”

This weekend, songwriters Pat Alger, Steve
Cropper and the late Paul Davis were also in-
ducted. ‘ C _ .

Other Hall of Fame inductees includejimmy
Buifett, Bob Dylan and Dolly Parton. I ’

Desoto < 1

L and other landscaping over the demolition site.

Landscaping for the plaza will include ﬂow-
ers and trees meant to beautify the area. The
entire project should be complete by Dec. 31,

- with the exception of some of the landscaping,

Schwartzmier said.

“We should be able to get a lot of the grass
done before the winter,” he said. “But we might
not ﬁnish ﬁnal landscaping.”

Originally, construction workers plarmed
to demolish the DeSoto Building in parts. Once
asbestos was removed from one section of the
building, that section would be demolished.

Schwartzmier said city safety regulations
dictate that ﬁre sprinklers must be turned on in
any buildingwhile asbestos is removed. To keep
the building’s piping together for sprinkler use,

' the building had to be demolished only after the

whole building was cleared of asbestos.

The change in plans set the entire demolition
process back about two months, according to
Schwartzmier. .

Workers tried to make up for lost time by
conducting double shifts. Part of the workgo—

ing into these shifts is based around  the -

deconstruction of the DeSoto Building a purely

Green space

on the way

“green” project. Workers have collected steel .

and copper among other materials from the

debris and brought them to scrap yards to be .

recycled.

“We are recycling as much material as we
can.” Schwartzmier said. i

Under the green-deconstruction theme,
workers will use debris to ﬁll in the large base-
ment space left empty by the old building, rather
thanbringingin more foreign materials to do the
job. All of these actions, in addition to the green
ﬁnal product of a grassy plaza, gain LEED (Lead-
ership in Energy and Environmental Design, a
green-building certiﬁcation program) points for
any future building UPMC puts on the site.

Currently, UPMC plans to replace the plaza
three to ﬁve years after its completion with an-
other building. The forthcoming building will-
likely be an addition to UPMC Presbyterian

A hospital, though Schwartzmier said plans are

not officially in place.

“We’re not spendinga lot [of money] because
in three to ﬁve years we’re going to be tearing
it up,” Schwartzmier said. “But for those three
to ﬁve years we want to make it attractive and
inviting for people.” Q

Trash no match for students

Volunteers 4 1

sions — white everywhere — only it was not
snow that littered the street, it was discarded
cigarettes. _

As the volunteers started to clean, Mauer
said, “Guys, I think I found -stuff,” but she

was not referring to presents under a tree. .

Entangled in overgrown bushes, a chain-link
fence and ivy were plastic wrappers, shorts
and stray papers.

Some homeowners came out onto to their -

stoops to watch, a few even joking about
having the students come clean inside their
houses as well.

Mauer said “It was nice to see people honk
and wave. They asked us what we were doing
and, well, we’re just making a difference.”

Aservice fraternity, Alpha Delta from

; Duquesne, joined the volunteer effort.

“PMADD is not in conjunction with other

A universities,” said Matt Koller, chair of the

PMADD coordinating committee. “Pitt tries
to host the event on the same day the national

iMake A Difference Day organization has it,

but the past three years it conﬂicted with
football and homecoming.”

This year, national Make A Difference Day
falls on Saturday, Oct. 23.

Pitt is open to allowing neighboring uni-
versities to join PMADD, Koller said, but the

_ ideal day would be scheduled in accordance

with the national Make a Difference Day.

“There are about 3,000 vacancies open for
students’ to sign up,” Koller said. “We allow
3,600 students to register in case there are
dropouts. Next week an official count of the
exact amount of attendees of PMADD will be
made available.”

Residence Life typically signs up almost
half of the participants for the event. The
Greek community as well as honors student
groups, service groups andother student
organizations participate as well.

Mitchell said the volunteers’ job is an im-
portant one. '

“'I‘hetrash on the streets is appealing to
no one, visitor and residents alike.”

She‘said East Carson Street, South Side’s
main bar drag, attracts many weekend visi-
tors, and trash often clutters the streets on
the mornings after.

For that reason, Mitchell is trying to
partner with the Western Pennsylvania Con-
servancy to gather funding to continually

maintain some Pittsburgh neighborhoods’

and community gardens.

“It is a challenge to consistency, it’s diffi-
cult to have residents clean up the neighbor-
hood because they are busy,” she said.

By midafternoon, bus 42 collected a total
of 41 bags full oftrash. I

Academic faux-
Facebook won’t fly

Although your professor will probably still
yell at you for tweeting or checking Facebook
during class, it seems that schools are 
up to the idea of social media or even incor-

porating the new technology into academics. ’

Unforttmately, they’re doing it wrong. \

According to an article in The Chronicle
of Higher Education, the City University of
New York launched a new online resource
called Academic Commons, which strives to
connect faculty, staff and students through
a social network of blogs, subject groups and
academic discussions. The network only has
1,300 users out of a potential user base of
10,000. The University of Pennsylvania has a
similar network for its College of Liberal and

- Professional Studies.

These sites sound like they have about the
popularity potential of Blackboard.

In case that needs clariﬁcation, we’re pretty
sure students only use Blackboard when they
are forced to for an assignment. Actual social
networking sites are usedon a more voluntary
basis and actually prove to be mildly addicting
in our experience. ‘

We agree that schools should incorporate

social networking into academics, but they»

should use the resources that are already avail-

movies that entertain are even better. “Reefer

Madness” is a 1938 classic featuring a bunch

healthy, normal activities like playing tennis

and smoking cigarettes to “marihuana,” a

principal, who looks and sounds an awful lot

of the ﬁlm dramatically warns parents that if
kids smoke pot, they’re all going to have the

able to them, such as Facebook, Twitter, and
WordPress. Students are more likely to have

a site like this already open in their browser,.

rather than an academic Blackboard-like site,
and therefore would see academic updates
such as discussion boards and classmate-blog
posts along with social updates.

People are already comfortable with and
know how to use current social networking
sites like Facebook, making them more likely
to use them for academics rather than sites
speciﬁcally for academic networking. Formats
of already established sites also allow more
personal connections, possibly providing a
better opportunity for professors to get to
know their students.

Ifstudents are wary about academic author-
ities having access to their social—networking
shenanigans, they can consider altering their
privacy settings or creating one account for
professional networking and another for ex-
boyfriend stalking.

Ultimately, there is already a ridiculous
amount of social networking sites available.
We feel that students don’t need another one.
Schools should stop trying to compete with
current online networking giants and instead
work with them. I I

In last week’s column, I argued that mari-
juana should be legalized on philosophical
grounds. Of course, this didn’t cover practi-
cal considerations for legalization. So this
week, we move away from the highfalutin

Federalism-Freedom—and—Futility arguments

and consider the more mundane.

The war_ on drugs curtails the supply of
drugs available, as the only suppliers are
those willing to break the law. This makes
drug prices very high, resulting in a tremen-
dous proﬁt to be made. This creates a big
incentive to protect drug-selling territory
and trafficking routes. With the amount of
money there is to be made off drugs, the
protection of these routes is very well funded.
NPR estimates that marijuana and cocaine
are the two biggest sources of revenue for
Mexican cartels, with marijuana preferred
because the groups that deal in this drug
don’t have to sharetheir proﬁts with the

V Colombian cartels who supply the cocaine.

And because the merchandise the cartels are

selling is already illegal, there is no reason
to resort to legal means to protect territory
and routes. The drug war therefore creates a
very motivated, well-armed, well-organized
set of criminal gangs now ﬁghting a real war
against the Mexican government.

Remove the illegality at the federal level,
allow the importation of pot, and competi-
tion can enter the marketplace. More ﬁrms
will enter the previously restricted market
seeking a proﬁt. Cartels will then have to
compete with American commercial farm-
ers. This will cause the price of pot, as well
as proﬁts from its sale, to plummet. Sud-
denly, cartelstrafﬁcking marijuana don’t
have money to spend on guns. Sudd_enly,
they don’t need to protect the routes be-
cause the government does that for them.
And suddenly those selling marijuana have
an image to protect. Killing people is bad
for business. This helps explain why Border
Patrol and the Mexican Army aren’t ﬁghting
running battles against importers of Corona

ns for pot

and Dos Equis.

Violence in the United States would de-
crease as well, as drug- dealing gangs wouldn’t
have to ﬁght over territory. Furthermore,
standard business practices would change
with legalization. Nowadays, if a drug dealer
sells you oregano instead of pot, you can’t
exactly phone up the FDA or Ralph Nader
to complain. Similarly, a drug dealer can’t
quite sue for breach of contract. So, without
recourse to the law, what do you do when
someone acts unethically? You break the
guy’s kneecaps.

Legalizing marijuana would have posi-

tive ﬁscal consequences as well, as the drug ‘

could be regulated and taxed. A high sales
tax would allow the government to make
money off an activity that people engage in
anyway. The sales taxwould also_discourage
use, much as it has with cigarettes, without

causing the huge problems of violence and .

HPV silent but costly for men as well as women

Leah Trimble
Columnist

The several cylindrical bulletin boards that
protrude from our campus grounds almost
never catch my eye. To be honest, I think it’s a
complete waste of time to advertise your cause

in a place so populated with similar-looking _

paper announcements. Nothing tacked to these
boards stood out to me until recently, when an
informational sign grabbed my attention, ﬁnally
proving wrong my theory about the posting
process. V

I read it over and over again. The piece of
paperwas advertising information and aphone
number for a place where men could get vac-
cinated for human papillomavirus (HPV). My
mouth dropped open, leaving me in one of those
“wtf” moments. All I could thinkto myselfwas
that this was flippin’ genius!

HPV is the most common sexually trans-
mitted infection, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. At least 50
percent of sexually active men and women get
it at some point in their lives. The virus shows
no symptoms until it turns into a more serious
condition.

Ladies, this should all be old news to you
since the statistics were hyped up a few years
ago, but if you’re not aware, the Gardasilvaccine
canprevent75 percent of cervical cancer cases,
70 percent of vaginal cancer cases and about

half of all vulvar cancer cases. That should sell
you right there. -

I immediately wanted to know mo re ab out
the vaccine for men. Alter ﬁnding the original
announcement of approval for use of the HPV
vaccine in boys and men on the FDA’s website, I
noticed the date. The news reportwas released
Oct. 16, 2009. So why was I ﬁnding out about
it now?

Later on, I asked what seemed like everyone
I knew if they had ‘heard about approval. Not
one had. It’s almost as if Merck, the company
that makes Gardasil, considers this to be only a
mediocre development not worthy of magazine
ad space and daytime television. Did they run
out of money for advertising, or do they just
believe that women are the sole contributors
and receivers of the horrible outcomes caused
by HPV? Ifl were a guy and no one told me about
this, I would be extremely: angry.  . .

Infact, I remember the endlesslcongimercials
and almost obsessive stance my doctor had
when Gardasil first entered the medical market
for women. I thought it was just another ploy
for pharmaceutical companies to make a proﬁt
— until I looked at the alarming statistics. So
why haven’t we seen any clever yet ultimately
scary informational commercials telling men
that they too can get this form of protection
against STIS‘? _

j g Now, I am not one to preach about STI pre-
vention to my peers. We are adults now, and if

you are stupid enough to omit a condom from
the experience, then that is the risk you’re both
willing to take. But in this situation, where a
proven preventative treatment is available, I
will be happy to promote the cause.

In both men and women, the HPV vaccine
can help prevent 90 percent of genital warts
cases. Based» on the FDA’s statistics, two out of
every 1,000 men in the United States are newly
diagnosed each year.

If you’re still not convinced, imagine your
private parts covered in massive warts. I can
only imagine that it’s- not the loveliest sight.
I’m sure the procedure to get them cut ofl'.isn’t
very pleasant either.

Anyone ages nine to 26 can receive the round
of three shots given in a total of six months.

Dr. Elizabeth Wettick, medical director of C

Pitt’s Student Health Service, said that Pitt’s
facilities do provide the vaccine for men, but
the pharmacy charges $145 for each of the three
shots. Alter you completethe rounds, you can
submit the claimtoyour insurance. .

“For students who are insured, we often
recommend that they get the vaccine through
whomever their insurance views as their pri-
mary care provider, and, in that way, the student
can ensure that their irisurance will cover the
total cost of the vaccine,” Wettick said.

There are also several clinics, such as the

Planned Parenthood branch Downtown,_,that,

offer the vaccine based on a sliding scale oreven

at no cost, depending upon your income.
In regards to those holding back because of

anypreconceivednotions,Wetticksaidthat“it .

is still recommended that the vaccine is given
. even after an adolescent/young adult has been
sexually active.” ‘ I

Some people are still adjustingto the thought
of vaccinations for S'I'Is. The HPV vaccine is
still relatively new, and its long-term viability is
unknown. According to HPVHealth.net, three
girls have died as a result of being vaccinated.

' But Wettick feels strongly about prevention.
“I believe that the greater number of individu-
als who receive the HPV vaccine, the better, as
this will-help to decrease HPV transmission
and overall disease burden for both males and
females,”.she said. _

She’s right. One vaccine can prevent a life-
time ofhealth problenis,§ome incurable, and it
can especially prevent tlfose issues from be'_ jg
spread from person to person. i’  jj ._ , _- ;_ " ' 

HPV is a silent killersthat we can all take
caution against. Despite the fact that wonien
have been targeted as the HPV vaccination’s
main audience — possibly because women are
at risk for more diseases alter contracting the
STI —- men still stand to beneﬁt from getting
vaccinated. Who wouldn’t want to be protected
against possible cancers and genital infections?
This is a no-brainer. Call and make an appoint-
ment today if you haven’t already.

Close parallels between Prohibitionandpotillegality

Kozlowski< 6
smuggling. .

Some argue that the government’s tax
revenue would be minimal, because people
would be free to grow their own hemp. My
rejoinder to this claim is: People are free to
grow tomatoes, yet Giant Eagle still sells
them. Growing marijuana of suitable potency
is not easy in some parts of the country’; and
one way that marijuana growers currently
get busted is by running up the huge electric
bills, required for grow lamps. Even if the
government doesn’t gross one dollar on a
marijuana sales tax, doesn’t it still save the

cost of ﬁnding, arresting and incarcerating
those who possess or grow weed?

Finally, there is the argument that legaliz-
ing marijuana will lead to higher rates of use.
But when 42 percent of high school seniors
admitted having tried marijuana at some
point in their lives in 2007, how much higher
can the rates of marijuana use really climb?
It is also worth noting that the percentage of
seniors reporting marijuana use has declined
from 60.3 percent in 1980, despite the fact
that marijuana was just as illegal then as it is
now. This suggests that other factors not tied

to the drug’s illegality are making marijuana
use less prevalent among America’s youth.
Finally, we can consider the close parallels

between the Prohibition and the illegality of
marijuana. Prohibition sparked a wave of
gang violence. There was also trouble along
the border: the northern border. Detroit be-
came a shooting gallery as gangs smuggled
Canadian alcohol over the Detroit River.
Chicago, as a major transshipment point
for alcohol, had many legendary gangsters,
such as Al Capone prototype for just
about every single ﬁctional mob boss from

1§31’s “Little Caesar”ito:'Tony‘Soprano —— A

and George “Bugs” Moran, who popularized
the drive-by shooting. ,

Whathappened after Prohibition was re-
pealed? Did we become a nation of staggering
drunkards‘? No. And what of these terrifying
gangsters‘? Moran died broke and in prison,
jailed for robbing banks to make ends meet.

Capone died a penniless, raving lunatic. . *

With such similar stories, we’re likely to
see the same ending. I

Haunted Pittsburgh: Haunted Tour
Oakland A
Sunday, Oct. 24

Tickets: $15 online at www.haunted-

pittsburghtours.com or in person if no
sold out. '

' Meet at: Hillman Library, 6 p.m.

Haunted Pittsburgh makes a bone-chilling
claim: Oakland is the most haunted neigh-
borhood in Pittsburgh.

“If you ask someone what is considered
the most haunted [neighborhood], people
think North Side,” said Michelle Smith, co-
founder of Haunted Pittsburgh. “It has the
big ghost stories. But we did research and

Oakland seemed tohave the most ghost °

stories in a- small area. Almost every build-
ing or neighborhood seems to have a story
attached to it, especially around Pitt.”
Haunted Pittsburgh is a local historical
group with the aim of sharing local spirit
lore by offering ghost walks, something the

’ city previously lacked. The organization

offers spooky tales through ghost walks,
dinners and pub-crawls invarious parts of
the city. It usually offers tours primarily in
areas such as Mt. Washington and South
Side, but their discovery of Oakland and
Pitt’s ghoul—ﬁlled buildings have brought
them to this neighborhood.

Sean Collier of WDVE Morning Show
and Pittsburgh Magazine will host the
Oakland tours. The radio personality says
he’s not surprised by the amount of ghost
stories in Oakland. ~

“-You’ll ﬁnd a lot of stories associated
with most colleges,‘ especially those set
in-big buildings or dorms, just because
there are so many people moving in and
out frequently,” Collier said. “Stories are
bound to shovel up.” .

The Oakland tour will begin at Hillman
Library and go to the Quad, the William Pitt
Union, the Cathedral, the Carnegie Library,
and the Frick Fine Arts building. Many Pitt
students and staff use these buildings on
a daily basis. .

One of the more creepy stories involves
the Carnegie Library. A _city judge became

fond of the building after it opened in 1895.
But in the early 1900s, he went to the build-
ing to hang himself rather than to complete
his work. . -

“‘No one knows why he did so,” Col-
lier said. “Soon after he was found and
removed, the staff reported seeing writ-
ing on the walls. But not at ground level.
It was on the ceiling near the level of a
hung man.” A *

The words were written in Latin, and
when translated to English they read, “The

' judge is here.”

“Any library stack is creepy anyway,”
Collier said. “It’s isolated. Now you worry
you’ll run into a judge.”

Smith feels that people will want to
know the creepy lore of buildings they go
to everyday because they enjoy the adrena-
line rush that comes from feeling scared.
Ghost walks offer a safe environment to
feel chills up theuspine.

- “It’s places people are at every day,”
Collier said. “You’re in the Cathedral every

5 day for class and it’s commonplace, but

Festival

25 years

Staﬁ Writer

25th Annual Pittsburgh International
Lesbian & Gay Film Festival

Oct. 15-24 .

S'out‘hSide Works Cinema

‘ $6 student tickets for regular admission

(excludes opening and closing night)

Ours is an era when TV shows feature LGBT
characters. It is an era when ﬁlms center-
ing on LGBT life — films like Brokeback
Mountain and-Milk — receive mainstream
acclaim and awards. But ours is also an“
era when some of LGBT culture’s greates
achievements remain obscure. -

Though it is not widely known, Pitts-
burgh-has taken great steps to make at
least one area of LGBT self-expression
more visible: the cinema. It’s a rich cat-
egory of contemporary ﬁlmmaking that
the Pittsburgh Lesbian 8: Gay Film Society
has promoted for years.

In 1985, local psychotherapist and mov-
ie buff Richard Cummings founded what is
now the Pittsburgh International Lesbian_

8: Gay Film Festival, the world’s sixth-M ~
oldest LGBT ﬁlm festival. This year, the ‘

event celebrates it’s 25th anniversary.
“It used to be that if you didn’t go to’ the

festival and see these ﬁlms, you’d never

see them again. In 1985 you didn’t have

“Will & Grace” and “Queer as Folk.” If you?‘

identiﬁed as LGBT and wanted to go to the
movies and see yourself on screen, this
was the place to do it,” said Mitchell Leib,
festival president and programming direc-
tor,pwhen stressing how ground-breaking

Cummings’ work was. ,_

Now, a lot has changed. The New Queer
Cinema of the ’90s evolved into“’some—
thing more far—reaching than a branch of
independent ﬁlm, and, with the help of
"home video and information technology,
LGBT movies have drawn attention from
heterosexual circles as well. According"
to James Richards, the festival’s market-

to look at it through these stories, it adds
intrigue and mystery to what would be a
normal place.” ~ '

Haunted Pittsburgh is not the same as
a haunted house or other Halloween at-
traction because of its use of historical
research and local testimony, according
to Collier.

“On all of our tours, we have shorter
stories and those from people in the area,
as well as Pittsburgh history,” Collier said.
“There’s also just a certain sense of reality.
I love Halloween attractions, but this is a
chance to hear a reportedly true ghost story
and be at the place and in its presence. I
think a tour like this is so much more real
than Halloween attractions.”

Ghost stories might be set any time from
the 1700s to as recently as the 1900s, de-
pending on what the tour guides decide
to use.

“A lot of our stories are very historic,

but we have some new accounts as well,”-

Smith said. “We are careful using new sto-
ries because if there are recent deaths or

hauntings, we don’t feel it’s appropriate to '

tell that story.”

At the end of the tour, though, Smith
reminds everyone, believers and skeptics
alike, that their job is to research and en-
tertain, not investigate. Collier himself is
skeptical of whether or not every element
in a ghost story ever actually happened.

“We are not here to make you believe
or disbelieve,” Smith said. ‘‘You’ll find the
stories interesting and learn a bit of his-
tory.” C

“These stories have survived and it’s an
interesting folk tradition all on its own,”
Collier said. I.

who are amazing in their roles.”

“I still feel it’s really important that we
have a festival like this, because watching
something in your living room is not the
same as watching something in a theater
with a whole audience. The theater ex-
perience is more interactive, more well-
rounded.” Leib said, insisting that the
increased availability of LGBT material
does not make festivals like Pittsburgh’s

irrelevant.

While LGBT culture is less marginal, it
is still rare to see authentic representa-
tions of LGBT life at the highest-grossing
levels of our entertainment industry —
hence the importance of festivals like
Pittsburgh’s.

“You can go to the movies any day of
the week and see a straight love story.
But if you want to go with your peers and

watch a ﬁlm that’s about two women or
two men, or a bisexual story, if you want
to watch something that’s part of your
community, you have to come to our fes-,,_
tival,” said Leib.

Richards added that the Pittsburgh
Lesbian & Gay Film Society has “made
a concerted effort to reach out to all the
Pittsburgh colleges. We hope we have
ﬁlms that will speak_to them.” .

Panthers

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

The men’s soccer team ﬁnally earned its ﬁrst
Big East win of the season Saturday, and it did
so in dominant fashion.

Justin Boehm and Alex Grayson scored
early goals for Pitt and Sam Luffy added an

“insurance tally in the second half to push the

Panthers by Rutgers 3-0 Saturday afternoon
at Founders Field.

Pitt moves to 1-2-2 in the Big East and
6-5-2 overall, while Rutgers remains winless
in conference play at 0-5-0 and 3-8-1 overall.

.. T ,The win comes as relief to a Panthers team

that felt it should have come out of _its ﬁrst
four Big East games with more than just two
draws, against Syracuse and Marquette.
“We feel like we didn’t get the points that
we wanted, out of Syracuse and Marquette.

g V especially,” senior Alex Betancourt said. “We
"needed to start winning some games if we

want to make the Big East tournament.”
The top-six teams from each of the Big
East’s two divisions qualify for the tourna—

ainin

ment. With the win, Pitt holds the sixth and
ﬁnal spot with four games left to play. -

Boehm opened the scoring against the
Scarlet Knights in the 19th minute when he
on'e—timed a cross from Terry Boland past
Rutgers goalkeeper Adam Klink for the 1-0
lead.»

Pitt added another goal nine minutes later
when a Rutgers defender took down a Panther
in the box. Officials awarded a penalty kick,
and Grayson converted it to put Pitt up 2-0.

“Over these last few games, he’s deﬁnitely
coming into his own,” head coach Joe Lux-
bacher said of Grayson.

After not scoring through Pitt’s ﬁrst 10
contests of the season, Grayson ‘now has two
goals in his last three games. The freshman,
however, left the game in the 64th minute
with a concussion. ’

“He got tripped up and slammed his head
on the ground,” Luxbacher said.

According to Luxbacher, he will most
likely miss Pitt’s game against Georgetown
this Wednesday but he may return to the
lineup after that.

Sam Luffy added an insurance goal in the

67th minute to put a Rutgers comeback out
of reach. Terry Akpua sent a high cross over
to Luify, who redirected the ball past Klink
with a diving header. The junior leads the
Panthers with four goals and nine points on

the year. '

With a three-goal cushion, goalkeeper
Hami Kara turned aside ﬁve shots for his sixth
shutout of the season.‘ Rutgers out-shot the
Panthers 15-9 and out-cornered them 8-4, but
Luxbacher said the stats are due to a change
in how his team plays. .

“We’re playing a little bit more conser-
vatively defensively,” he said. “Shots are
deceiving. Early in the season, we were out-
chrnering teams signiﬁcantly and not getting
anything for it. [Rutgers] had some chances,
but we scored three good goals.”

Pitt used the same game plan at West Vir-
ginia last Wednesday. The game remained
scoreless until the 64th minute, when the
Panthers couldn’t clear a ball and the Moun-
taineers capitalized.

“We stuck to the same game plan [against

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Congratulations, Brett Favre, you’re now
the most recent NFL quarterback to come
into question for some negative”, off—ﬁeld
activity.  V , .

The veteran quarterback is being ac-
cused of f‘sext_ing” formerjets employee
Jenn Sterger and is making headlines
for all the wroiig reasons for the picture
he reportedly sent of his, well, you get
the idea.

On the heels of Mike Vick’s conviction
for his involvement in dog fights and
the accusations against Ben Roethlis—
berger for allegedly sexually assaulting
a woman this summer — both of which
led to suspensions — you would think
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell would
crack down on Favre.

But we all know he probably won’t.

Favre is the league’s poster child, its
most prized player. He can pretty much
do whatever he wants. '

What other player can essentially skip
training camp two years in a row while
he decides whether he feels like playing
or not‘? . .

If Big Ben was discovered “sexting,”
the public would likely be urging Goodell

to lay a heavy suspension on him. But '

not with Favre.

Now, Favre hasn’t been convicted ofa
crime, but neither was Roethlisberger.

But if it would’ve been‘Favre in that
bathroom, all we’d probably have heard
the media talk about would have been
how wrong the girl was for having sex
with a married man. ’

Because there’s no way he could have
been at fault.

How could Favre, the Silver Fox, do
any wrong?

CROSS COUNTRY

Panthers fall short at Penn State

Eucas Eelakl Senior Staff Photographer

The Pitt crossicountry teams are preparing for the Big East Championships at the end of the month.

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s cross—country
teams ended their regular-season schedule
with disappointing results.

The men ﬁnished in 23"‘ place on Friday at
State College, Pa., while the women took 28”‘
place out of more than 35 schools, including
the top—ranked men’s team from Syracuse
and women’s team from Villanova.

“Our team ran poorly, and most of the
guys were not competitive with the rest of
the runners,”Josh Christopher said. “It was
a tough course, and a bit longer of a racing
distance today, so perhaps they let their
nerves get to them too much, which may
have slowed them down.”

The event took place on the Blue 8: White
Golf Course, where the men ran a 5.2-mile
race. This was 0.37 kilometers longer than
their usual 8k race, and the women raced
in a 6k.

Christopher, who has been aconsistent
performer for the Panthers all season, ﬁn-
ished the race in 82"“ place with a time of
26:51.

“Individually, I didn’t race toimy fullest
potential, but as Ia focus on Big East now, I’ll
be sure to become more race sharp so I can

\
v

.\

run faster at Syracuse,” he said.

Senior leading runner Teddy Miller was
unable to compete this past weekend due
to illness. -

“This hurt our team performance since
[Teddy] is such a huge contributor to our
team doing well,” Christopher said A

Close behind Christopher in the Panther’s'_

pack were runners Kevin Hull, Andrew Cer-
rito, Wesley Washington, Dontave Cowsette,
Elliot Rhodes and Vinnie DePalma.

For the women, freshman Susannah Fein—
stein led the team with a time of 23:09.

, Elesia Wilson, Stephanie Powers, Rachel
Hess, Miyajohnson, Rachel Erny and Emily
Barno closed out the top—seven competitor
for the team. ’ - -

“As far as my consistency with every race,

I just look at people that annoy me inthe race .

and focus on-passing them,” Wilson said. .

The men and women will practice for
the next, week in preparation for the Big
East Championships held Oct. 30, in Syra-
cuse, NY. The event will be held at Drumlins
Country Club. - .

“At a team level, I would probably just
[like to see] faster times, which has been
happening so I’m happy with everything,”
Wilson said. “As an individual, I just want to
get my times down and be a person to look
out for in the, Big East.” I

“Favre should be punished for his “sexts”

"-‘ioltmanns < 12

I’m not saying that Ben’s suspension
was wrong — he violated NFL policy and
needed to be punished for it. The NFL
just needs to be fair and not give prefer-

,_ ential treatment to certain players.

The league needs to suspend Favre.

He didn’t break any laws, but he defi-
nitely violated the NFL’s personal con-
duct policy, if the allegations are true.

Betancourt said. “It’s really working well. Even
against West Virginia, we played well.”

West Virginia won that game, 2-0, out-
cornering the Panthers 11-; and out-shooting
them 16-5. ' ‘ ‘

' “65 minutes in and they really didn’t have
a good look,” L_uxbacher said. “They had a lot
of shots -4- long shots, wild shots — and then
their ﬁrst goal, it was abad decision. We didn’t
clear a ball we could have.’.’ if

Ruben Garrido scored the game-winning
‘goal for West Virginia off the miscue. Pitt
pressed to try to even the score, but the
Mountaineers took advantage and added a
second goal in the 84th minute when Abel
“Shadow” Sebele beat Kara on a break with
a low, hard shot.

' “Their second goal was because we were
pushing everybody forward,” Luxbacher said.
“If we weren’t one goal down, we wouldn’t
have pushed everybody up.” _

Pitt resumes play Wednesday against
Georgetown at 7 p.m. at Founders Field. The
