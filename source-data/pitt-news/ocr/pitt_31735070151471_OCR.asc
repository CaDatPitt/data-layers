Teach for
America may i
extend to

Pittsburgh

Chris Puzia A
For The Pitt News

When Mark Young graduated from Pitt last
year, he told Teach for America that it could
send him anywhere.

But now, one year later, Pittsburghers are
arguing for Pitt students and graduates, like
Young, to have the opportunityto stay closer
to their alma mater.

Linda Lane, superintendent for Pittsburgh
public schools, wants to use Teach for America
teachers to ﬁll 15 to 30 vacant spots among the
54 district schools for the 2014 school year.
Lane said that instead of hiring new staff, A
the school district is considering recruiting
individuals from Teach for America’s appli-
cant pool, mostly comprised of recent college
graduates without education degrees, to ﬁll
the positions. , _

Lane said the matter should be up for de-
bate at the school board legislative meeting
later this month.

Young currently teaches math to seventh
and eighth graders in the Louisiana Delta
through Teach for America. Young didn’t list
a preference for desired location on his ap-
plication to the organization. A

Young participated injump Start, a national
literacy program that links college students

Elimination of University yearbook ﬁts trend

Danielle Fox
Staﬁ Wrz'ter

Cherish the memories, for the printed pages

of the University yearbook have come to an 

end. -
In September, the University decided to
no longer produce “Panther Prints,” its year.-

book, whichwas ﬁrst published in1907 under '

the name “The Owl.” In its place, Pitt will

offer a free digital photo album to chronicle’

student events that will include an interactive
feature allowing students to upload personal
photos. While students and alumni have not
reacted unfavorably to the decision, yearbook

experts saidthe negative impact will become-

. more apparent decades from now. ,

_ Pitt is not alone. Large universities are
‘increasingly dropping their yearbook pub-

lications. The University of Virginia and
Purdue University, both schoolsiwith more
than 20,000 students, stopped production

Student Affairs, approached the Student
Government Board in September with low
yearbook sales data and proposed a search
for an alternative.

Last year, only 114 of Pitt’s more than
3,500 seniors registered to receive a free
online copy of “Panther Prints,” and 40 se-
niors purchased a hard copy for $50.

The Board has funded the annual publica-
tion of Panther Prints with roughly $41,000
through a 1._6 percent allocation from the
Student Activities Fund each year. This posed
a problem for Ahearn.

“We carmot justify spending the amount
of money, time and energy to produce apiece
for which there is such minimal demand,”
he said.

Board member C.J. Bonge estimated that
the online photo album production would
reducethe costto about $10,000 to $12,000,
according to an article previously published
in The Pitt News.

‘ book” for ﬁrst—year students detailing cam-
pus could use a portion of the remaining‘

funds, with the rest returningto the Student

Activities Fund. ‘

Laura Calhoun, a senior English writ- 
ling major and current editor of “Panther 7

Prints,” said her staff is excited about the
photo album, which will launch in the spring
semester. Calhoun saidshe thinks the format
will be more accessible to students, who will
have access to the album throughout the year

. because the staff will continuously upload

pictures. ‘ ~ A
Four faculty members and 18 students

3 worked an estimated 1,200 hours to produce

last year’s yearbook, Ahearn said. The online
album will require less writing and graphic
design bythe staff members because they
will only post-photos with headlines, rather
than more detailed information about the
individuals in the photographs. -
Brooks said that photographs are only a

‘ ‘piece of the story that a yearbook tells. Brooks

said she does not think the photo album will
effectively depict the full story behind an
event without the accompanying articles that
provide history and perspective.

Corrine Satriano, former 1999 and 2000
editor of the yearbook, feltisimilarly.

with preschool age students, which sparked
his interest inTeach for America, a nonproﬁt
organization that places college graduates in
schools nationwide.

Lane said she is excited to potentially work
with Teach for America because of the non-
proﬁt organization’s track record for hiring
teachers of different racial backgrounds. She
hopes the diversity could reﬂect upon both
her school district and Teach for America’s
commitment to education.

“Teach for America is doingamuch stron-
ger job of attracting people of color,” Lane
said. “We have a goal here of ﬁnding diversity
inthe workplace.” '

Danielle Montoya, a spokeswoman for
Teach for America, said it would be possible
for Pitt graduates working for Teach for Amer-

ica to stay and teach locally. She added that
placement ultimately depends upon the num-
ber of available positions in the region and
which applicants match up with that region.

“They can certainly have the opportunity
to prefer where they are teachin ” Montoya

said. “But it also depends on how many teach-

ers the public schools need, and we would
need to see which individuals matc .”
Accordingto anAugustpress release from
Teach for America, Pitt ranks 20th among
large universities whose graduates entered
the 2013 Teach for America corps. Last year,
38 Pitt graduates joined Teach for America.
The2013 corpswas composed of4,366 gradu-
ating seniors — 0.8 percent of which came

from Pitt.

‘New college graduates play a large part
in Teach for America’s staff, and graduating
seniors compose 74 percent of the organiza-
tion’s teaching staff, according to the release.

Lane said that the purpose of usingTeach
for America staff in local public schools would
be to bring in “hard-to-ﬁnd teachers” for cer-
tain subjects’.

“Our priority would mostly be for hard
subjects like chemistry or physics,” she said.
“Not elementary schools.”

Accordingto its website, Teach for Ameri-
ca staff members receive annual salaries rang-
ing ﬁ'om $25,000 to $51,000 and in some
cases also receive health beneﬁts, depending
on the region to which they are sent.

After a school district releases its target
number of teachers, both the school district

_ andTeachforAmericaworktogethertodeter-

mine the individual teachers to send, depend-
ing onwhich subjects require new educators.

“It is entirely a partnership,” Montoya
said. “We would work with the superinten-
dent and have conversations with the school
district’s human resources director.”

Lane said she is notworried about possible
inexperience in teachers brought in through
the program.

“We hire inexperienced teachers a lot,”
Lane said. “I would hope that [people who op-
pose the idea] review data for the success that
Teach forAmericahas and remind themselves

.that they are college-educated teachers.”

Montoya said that Teachfor Americaseeks
to “recruit people witl1 a passion to teac ,”
among other qualities.

“We have developed a pretty robust selec-
tion and recruitment model over the past 23
years,” she said. “Our most successful teachers
have apast history of achievement and leader-

ship, have persevered through challenges and
have critical thinking skills.” 1'

Young said that his training consisted of a
six~week summer training program, followed
by three weeks spent in the classroom, one
hour per day. . 1

“So I had 15 hours of teaching experience,”

Young said, though he added that he did not _

feel unprepared.

Teach for America’s application process
lasts several months, beginning with online
applications-and: followed byphone inter-

7 views. Recruiters then personally intervie

selected applicants- - “

Most college graduates who enter into the
Teach for America program are sent across
the country to any of the 48 regions in 35
different states for which Teach for America
provides teachers, according to the program’s
website. . . AV

Butby requestingtlie organization to send
teachers to Pittsburgh,‘ Pitt graduates such as
Young may have the option to stay local and
still contribute tothe program. .

Young said that if given the opportunity,
he would stay in Pittsburgh while working
with Te:-1chfforAmerica. _

“I would have stayed because I already
knew these preschool children I have worked
with,” he said. “It deﬁnitely would have
changed my preference.”

Lane said she is unsure if the decisionwill
pass the school board vote later this month,
but hopes that it does.

“Every board member has to make their
own decision,” she said, “and I strongly hope
that they will.” I

The Roman orator Cicero once

his birth will rermaijgn ,for¢ve1i;f

V V V Now that the ladministrntion :4
.£:f..thle'- Diet-1éi‘ci1t.:scho-ck f Arts

 

and Sciences has dis:regard‘ed'-
this advice by moving to sus-
pend the graduate programs
in classics, German and reli-
gious studies, fewer students
will beneﬁt from this ancient
wisdom:

The indeﬁnite suspension of
graduate programs in classics
and German and the termina-
tion of the graduate program in
religious studies has met with
trenchant opposition since its
first proposalgin April 2012.
The students and faculty of
these departments learned
that the deans had agreed to
suspend admission to their‘pro-
grams without prior warning.
The deans waited until after
the decision had been made to
inform even the departmental
chairs ~— without any consulta-
tion — that they would return

‘to severely downsized depart-
ments. —

Since then, petitions have
circulated, meetings have been
held and editorials have been
written decrying this‘narrowa

' minded move against the integ-

rity of the humanities at Pitt.
Most recently, on Oct. 24, the
University Council on Graduate
Study nafrowly voted against
the suspensions in German and
religious studies, but supported
the cut to the classics depart-

ment. The fate of these depart-
ments, however, continues in
doubt down the bureaucratic
rabbit hole. g
‘Unfortunately, the vibrant

discussion concerning the mer-
_'it's_ of thesesdepartments — or
- thgefmerits of their dismantling

‘alias been unable to escape
 language ;of that bureau-

A cracy. According to Provost Pa-

tricia Beeson, the consistent
divestment of the Common-

wealth. of Pennsylvania from .
-the University has forced the

administration to “examine
areas of previous commit—.
ment and consider difﬁcult
choices.” Neither she norjohn
Cooper, dean of the Dietrich
School of Arts and Sciences,
have provided a reason for the
University’s total severance of
three particular departments
rather than, say, an equitable
reduction in funding across the
board.

, This argument for the cuts
—- that is, the onlyargument
‘— emerges from an accurate
description of the common-
wealth’s receding support for
the University. But this blanket
justiﬁcation fails to cover the
fact that the resulting cuts to
graduate-level teaching assis-
tant positions actually consti-
tute a “reallocation of money,”
rather than a ﬁnancial cut, ac-
cording to a letter from Pitt’s
chapter of the Association of
American University Profes-
sors that directly cites “focus—

- ing on the futurej’ as the offi-

cial strategic plan for the ﬁscal
year 2013.

. So not only do the admin-
istrators provide insufﬁcient

reasons for eliminating entire
programs due to a lack of funds,

‘ but the funds in question aren’t

even sufﬁciently lacking. And
anyone enjoying the new soft-
serve ice cream in Market Cen-
tral could tell you that.

While these same arguments
have been rehearsed repeatedly
in faculty meetings and on the
pages of the University Times,
they have gone on largely free
from the attention of under-
graduates. However, besides

graduate students, undergrad-

uates stand to lose the most in
the wake of this proposal.

In purely practical terms,
graduate programs provide op-

” portunities for distinguished P

scholars to inﬂuence the fu-
ture of their academic ﬁelds
—- primarily by advising dis-
sertations. Without this option,

world-class professors will see-
little beneﬁt from j oining Pitt’s .

faculty, leaving undergraduates
unable to access the greatest
minds in their fields, either in-
side or outside the classroom.

a The loss of graduate-level
teaching assistants in these
subjects closes a necessary
source of in-class support for
professors teaching large lec-
tures. Fewer TAs means fewer
opportunities for recitation,
review and one-on—one assis-
tance.

When asked about this de-
velopment, fourth—year clas-
sics graduate student and in-
troductory Latin instructor
Brooke McLane—Higginson
noted, “This of course affects,

if not the number and ‘availability of
classics, Latin or Greeklcourses, at least“
the amount of attention available to in-

dividual students.”

What is more, graduate-level classes
are no longer made available either to
graduate students suchas McLane-Hig-
ginson, or to curious undergraduates

looking for an introduction to scholar-
ship in these fields. ‘
Among these pressingwpractical eon-
siderations, some tfundatnental consid-
erations-jhavebeen lost. Discussioiilfof
thepinhetrentvalue of an educati'ot:if-in
these ﬁelds has given way to specula-
tion on the monetary valueof “previous
commitments.” In short, this debatehas
illustrated just how far a university can

stray from its two fundamental obl;iga— V

tions: to deliver a worthy education and

to always re—evaluate what that means.

To meet these obligations, Provost
Beeson and the deansfor the Dietrich_
School must explain why advanced study
in German, classics and religious studies
issuperﬂuous to the worthy undergradu-
a'te_e.ducation that the.University takes
such pains to advertise. Simply repeating
the mantra of state budget cuts will not

. do‘.-And considering the cultural influ-
ence‘ of German art and literature, the
lasting traditions of the ancient world’ I

and the inescapable force of religious
belief in the modern day, any argument
for these programs’ dispensability would
require either cynicism or ignorance e
neither of which accurately characterize
our well-meaning administrators;

If Pitt isserious about maturing as a
university,fit should heed the advice of
Cicero to stop always “focusing on the
future” and take .a moment to remember
the past. I _ ' I

ART -ON CAMPUS

It's not a giraffe: The truth about Pittismysterysculpturei

Grace Kelly
Staff Wrz'ter .

As the cool autumn air Whisks its way into
Pittsburgh and strips away the amber fo-
liage, the taXi—yellow sculpture that sits
between Posvar Hall and Hillman Library
seems to shine even more brightly. But
what exactly is this mysterious sculpture?

Possible answers as to its identity range

. from awkward giraffe, abstract mathemat-

ical equation and the occasional claim that
it is a tribute to Steelers pride.

While Pitt Pathﬁnders might casually
mention it as they lead prospective stu-

’ dents around campus, there are no mark-

ers_that explain what this sculpture is, who
"made it, why they did so or even how it
came to be plopped on Pitt’s campus. To
the masses of Pitt students who walk by,
around and under this yellow beacon, it re-
mains either anonymous or a relic of some
random alien deposition. The work’s iden-
tity was only revealed to me through an
exercise in my public art class. An ofﬁcial
Google search, only armed with the name
of the work, “Light .Up,” and the name of
the artist, Tony Smith (who lived from

  

1912 to 1980), indicated to me that the
only information available on the strange
sculpture came from the ever-unreliable

' Wikipedia.

Despite your tour guitie’s claims, this is not ‘a giraffe. Jeff Ahearn | Staff Photographer

Unsatisﬁed by Wikipedia’s un—sourced
and vague explanation for this piece, I
investigated further.

After many a sleepless night spent with

the University Library System‘ search en—.
gine, one too many Red Bulls and a new '

geometric yellow monster-chasing me
in my‘dreams,the time for some serious
Google News searching had come.

A week of failed attempts later, I ﬁnally
struck gold with a newspaper clipping
from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. As my
tired eyes read the 1989 article, it was as
if the clouds had opened and the shining

V tale behind this piece had been inscribed L

on a digital tablet ﬂoating down fromthe
heavens. ' V

In 1971, the Westinghouse Electric Cor-
poration wanted a piece of statement art-
work to place outside-their headquarter

. at the Gateway Center. ‘

At this time, large companies felt that
they _needed to show the public that they
wefe not only successful, but that they had
a sense of taste and culture. Westinghouse
had set aside $400,000 for its art program
and had already accumulated an astound-

According to her new single, “Hard out

I’m a man so I can’t personally speak to

Grimes’ eiftended Tumblr post back in April
about being berated by male fans and Ch-

that a different microscope is afforded to
women in the public eye.

Allen’s satirizing of this treatment is
entirely justiﬁed — except for one glaring
oversight.

In the music video for her new song, Al-

is that thisis immensely offensive. -

In addition to being a man, I’m also black. I i

still need help from the blogjezebel to decide
whether or not male privilege applies to me.
So while I won’t attempt to give any insight

on feminism, I can attest to my experience

as a black person in America and say cat-
egorically that Lily Allen’s video made me
uncomfortable. I

In one of the scenes, Allen pours whatl as-

Macklemore — also white —— tells the rap

community — mostly black —— how to act. 4

That’s not really why I’m offended, though.
I mean, the other day while I was walking
home a kid yelled the N—word at me out of
his truck and my ﬁrst reaction was. to laugh
because he added the Dave Chappelle twang
to it. My problem with Lily Allen is how much

in character and his grasp for the per-
fect punchline make it a frequently—ex—
hausting experience. You’d think that a
41-year-old rapper would be ready to rest
o_n his laurels — yet Eminem turns in an
excruciating amount of effort.

Somehow, crafting a token megahit
seems to come most naturally to Eminem
these days. After his ﬁrst collaboration
with Rihanna, “Love The Way You Lie,”
conquered anything and everything in
2010, teaming up with her again on “The
Monster” had to be one of his easiest
decisions.

— While it will surely find similar Bill-
board success, “The Monster” somehow
manages to be even less ambitious than
“Love The‘ Way You Lie,” capitalizing
heavily on the pop—EDM crossover aes-
thetic that has propelled artists such as
Flo Rida and Pitbull into stardom. On a
record that pledged -to “take it back to

tracks earlier, the Rihanna collaboration
feels confused and misplaced.

While MMLP2 will never be mistaken
for the introspection of Eminem’s previ-
ous efforts, he does occasionally reach
for an emotional gut-punch, albeit with
varied success. On breakup power—ballad
“Stronger Than I Was,” Eminem uncon-
vincingly croons for as long as he has in
any song. It’s easy to picture the aging
rapper on his knees with fists clenched,
nearly bursting alblood vessel to con-
vey the pain, anguish and rage —-— but
instead he provides us with one of the
most unintentionally hilarious choruses
of the year.

The Nate Ruess—assisted ballad
“Headlights” ﬁnds Eminem at his most
contemplative and remorseful, as he
seeks to finally make amends with his
mother. He strikes a genuine balance be-

tween understated regret and passionate’

rage — a balance that has characterized
some of his strongest tracks.

As Eminem braces for middle age,
perhaps a little mellowing out and easing
of the throttle wouldn’t hurt. I

weren’t satisﬁed with its holdings. They
wanted a “wow factor” — that one piece
that would be proudly displayed outside
the Gateway Center for the common ple-
bian to gaze at in admiration. Modern-
minimalist artist Tony Smith was commis-
sioned by then—board—chairman Donald
Burnham to create a work that would re-
ﬂect the company’s ‘_‘cultured” side. Smith’s
sculpture was to be the cherry atop the
proverbial art sundae. Smith was already
a well-respected and highly desired artist

-at the time of this commissioning, and

when he came to Burnham with a paper
model in hand, he was given the go—ahead
for this work. '

Inspired by a yellow truck rumbling
through the grey landscape of Dbwntown,
Smith designed the 11-ton steel sculpture
to have his usual angular, geometric form,
but instead of his usual black color choice,
he made this sculpture bright yellow.

The piece was assembled on—site in

the spring of 1974 with the use of a crane,
and the legacy of “Light Up” was born.
However, its presence outside the Gateway
Center was short—lived.

According to a 1989 article in the Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette, the statue was taken
down — never to be reinstalled — as
plans were made to renovate the Down-
town plaza.

‘, Rumor has it that the reason it was
never reinstalled is that Burnham didn’t
like the way it looked and renovation was
the perfect excuse to shelve the sculpture.

After languishing in the storage closet
for some time, the Work was eventually
brought to its current location through
the efforts of Pitt architect Ana Guzman.
In 1989, Guzman was able to convince
Westinghouse to donate the sculpture to
the University. “The space [Forbes Quad-
rangle] needed some color,” she told the
Post—Gazette. A special base was made to
level the work’s arch with the overhang

CONCERT

Built to Spill plays simple show at
S Mr. Smalls

Jack Trainor
For The Pitt News

After a couple of embarrassingly bad
opening performances, it soon became
clear that on Monday night at Mr. Smalls,
Built to Spill had a clean—up job to do.

Thankfully, the Idahoan alt-rockers
took to the task with refreshing and un-
assuming professionalism, as well as a
little bit of fun that broke through in quick
spurts throughout the night.

.’ Drawing a crowd of college—aged kids
and middle-aged adults alike, the band —
which was founded back in 1992,‘ before
many of those college kids were even born
— put on a performance that highlighted
its ability to remain relevant without sac-
riﬁcing its modest and simplistic approach
to music.

By the time Built to Spill took the stage
at 10 p.m., the show’s expectations had
been heightened after the poor and seem-
ingly improvised effort put forth by open-
ing acts Slam Dunk and The Warm Hair,
whose goofball antics on stage quickly
grew annoying.

Led by frontman Doug Martsch, Built
to Spillplayed a lengthy and straight-faced
show. The fan-friendly set featured songs
spanning the band’s entire career — in-
cluding tracks from 1993’s Ultimate Al-
ternative Wavers and 2009"s There Is No
Enemy — which made for a nicely paced
exploration of the band’s history.

In addition to the band’s o.wn cata-
logue, a handful of covers made their

way into the set list, including a sooth— '

ingly lo—ﬁ cover of Pavement’s “Here,” in
which the natural quivering of Martsch’s
voice conjured undeniable similarity to
Pavement singer Stephen Malkmus. This
came after the band’s own song, “Built to
Spill,” during which Mar-‘tsch’s voice wailed
and cracked enough for the song to be
mistaken for another Pavement original.

A stunning and well-practiced cover of
Blue Oyster Cult’s “Don’t Fear the Reaper”
— which came second in a three—song
encore — was perhaps the highlight of
the ‘show. It may have also been the only
song where Martsch kept his bobbing head
still enough to sing directly into the mi-
crophone, allowing an enthusiastic audi-
ence to join in. '

Apart from a single candle on top of a
wooden box labeled “Buffalo Field Cam-

. paign”, there was no backdrop or stage
‘props of any kind — only the band’s ﬁve

members. This kept the show stripped

, of external distractions so that Built to

Spill could operate‘ the way they do best:
focused on the music.

This simplicity also put more focus on
the band’s somewhat timid presence on
stage, and Martsch’s droopy eyes rarely
left the ﬂoor. When they did, he closed
them. The only time headdressedrthe

‘audience was when he murmured an oc-

casional “thanks” after every other song.
This allowed the band to breeze through
their lengthy set list, most of which ended

anyone in the audience can relate to.
Mogentale’s performance as Lee
fares slightly better. - . _
His every aesthetic detail — from
his dirty trench coat to the heels of his
sockless feet sticking out of worn—out
dress shoes — is impeccable, and his
forceful, always-obnoxious delivery is
reminiscent of every unpleasant con-

versation on public transportation
the audience has ever experienced. In
the play’s opening scene, he leans into
Austin after several painful minutes of
fishing for arguments, and, in a mo-
ment of near self—awareness, asks, “Am
I bothering you?”

This does not mean, however, that
Mogentale’s performance doesn’t suffer
from the same sort of crudeness and
clumsiness as Barnett’s. Rather, Lee
seems to thrive on the same crudeness
that is so troublesome for a portrayal

of Austin. Though he often fails to nail
the play’s most poignant lines, it is
easy to chalk this up to the charact_er’s
obliviousness rather than the actor’s
carelessness. ..
When combined with the play’s
indulgent use of a cliched Western
soundtrack, these slightly tone-deaf
performances ultimately give viewers
a sense of a play that is not quite fully
realized. The style’s there from floor
to ceiling. The substance of the show,
however, is nowhere to be found. I

“badass” for using woefully outdated hip-
hop‘ tropes to essentially lambast black men.

In the video, Allen doesn’t satirize the
lower wages women are paid or the expecta-
tion for them to be witless eye—candy. She
goes straight to the ’90s rap video stereotypes
of oversexualized, “bling” obsessed black
men — the same stereotypes that parents‘
use to warn their white daughters about the
perils of dating a black man (I’m speaking
from experience).

I doubt Grimes’ accosters expected her

‘ to twerk on stage, nor do I think any of the

suits at Allen’s label are asking her to, either.
Her mistreatment as a woman in pop music
has nothing to do with rap archetypes "-
now painfully associated with a particular
demographic. Her problem, as with all dis-
advantaged groups in America, is structural.

While Miley Cyrus received ﬂak for ap-
propriating black culture,~at least she seemed
genuine when she did it. In Allen’s case, she’s
using black stereotypes to make a point.

That point (black men are awful?) isn’t
entirely clear, but whatever it is, I’m getting
kind of sick of it. ‘

In our current media landscape, a Netﬂix
series like “Orange is the New Black” can be
lauded as groundbreaking while perpetuating
the oldest and most hurtful stereotypes about
black people. This might explain why _Allen
is so unapologetic for this awful song’s even
more awfulvideo.

Just because you’re making a statement
against privilege doesn’t mean you get to
drag other marginalized people down in the
process.

It’s hard out here for a lot of people, not
just Lily Allen. I

once more saw the light of day.

The piece still remains an important
icon of Tony Smith’s minimalist works,
and in 1998, Pitt loaned the work to the
Museum of Modern of Art in New York
City for a retrospective exhibition. The
sculpture spent a few months in New York’s
Seagram Building Plaza before returning
home to Pitt, where it has remained ever
since.

Yet amid this recognition, the work
remains without any kind of identifying
plaque. This is a common issue in the ex-
amination of local monuments and sculp-
tures: Many of these once-well-known and
admired works go relatively unknown and

uncared for in the modern=era. As relics of

past public art projects, they dot our ev-

eryday landscape, icons of historical pasts

waiting for their stories to be unearthed.
So next time you walk by “Light Up,”

see it for what it really is: a masterwork of
A modern art, newly rediscovered!

Despite his reservations, Martsch

WOMENS BASKETBALL

Pitt looks to
continue its  
early winning
ways

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

On a college basketball schedule, regular sea-

son games in early November usually pit teams

against lesser opponents in an effort to ﬁnd

the right mold for a roster before the start of
the upcoming conference season.

. But for the Pitt women’s basketball team,
the next two contests are games that go against
conventional schedulingwisdom, with oppo-
nents as tough as some of Pitt’s new Atlantic
Coast Conference foes. ‘

The Panthers (1-0) travel to Muncie, Ind.,
on Thursday for a matchup with Ball State, in
a game in which head coach Suzie McConnell-
Serio said Pitt “will have to do a lot of things
well.”

“We have to defend well because they shoot
well from the perimeter,” she said.

Pitt returns home Sunday to face Lafayette
and hopes to avenge last year’s 68-65 loss to
the Leopards.

Senior guard Marquel Davis is expected
to make her season debut alter sitting out
the season opener with a mild ankle sprain.
6-foot—11 Marvadene “Bubbles” Andersonisv

also expected to return Thursdayfrom a one-_.,

game suspension after violating team rules. V
The trip to Ball State will represent the
ﬁrst of three out of the next four games that
the Panthers play on the road, with upcom-
ing trips to Michigan and Loyola (Md.) set
for next week. i
Redshirt sophomore guard Loliya Briggs

said the road trips are a great opportunity to '2 ‘-

build camaraderie among teammates, espej,
cially early on in the long season.

build team chemistry,” Briggs said. “When
you go on the road, you don’t pick your room-
mates, so you ﬁnd yourself hanging around
people you don’t usually hang around and that
helps build chemistry on and off the court.
Road trips are really fun for me.”

McConnell-Serio shared similar senti-
ments, saying her teams have thrived on the
road in the past.

“It is exciting when you travel. Ithinkthat
is the one great thing about college basket-
ball,” McConne1l-Serio said.»“Even the way
we travel, everything we do is ﬁrst-class with
the accommodations. It is atime for the team
to bond.” 1

She credits the success on the road to lim-

/

ited distractions for the players and a clear
focus on preparing for the game.

The road trip comes on the heels of the
Panthers’ ﬁrst regular season game, a 66-51
victory over Bucknell on Thursday. McCon-
nell-Serio said one thingthe Panthers have to
focus on in both the Ball State and Lafayette
games is hitting the boards, after Pitt was
out-rebounded 59-38 Thursday.

“Just ﬁnishing our defensive box outs
will be important, because in the Bucknell
game we just didn’t rebound the ball well,”
McConnell-Serio said. “We have to have an
improvement in that area because they send
players to the glass.” . ,

Briggs and Logan echoed their head coach
alter Wednesday’s practice, saying that staying
in the right spots on the ﬂoor and bringing
down boardswillbe key. ‘

“With the plays that they run, if we defend I .

their concepts the way our coach tells us, we
willbe ﬁne,” Briggs said. “Just haveto execute
our offense and rebound —we should be ﬁne.”

The Panthers have a bone to pick with
Lafayette when they come home Sunday,
one year after the Leopards ended Pitt’s ﬁve-
game nonconference winning streak. Tip-off
is scheduled for 1 p.m.

Briggs said the Panthers certainly did
not forget about last year’s contest, a game
in which Lafayette shot 50 percent (10-20)
from beyond the-arc.

_ “Lafayette is an opponent that really cut me
deep, because they hit‘ just about every three
they possibly could last season, so I have a type
of vengeance,” Briggs said. “That is ateamyou
want to get bac .” c

* Briggs said that is the type of team they
have to show up to beat.

“They can’t come in our house and beat
us two years in a row. It’s not happening,” she
said. I '
