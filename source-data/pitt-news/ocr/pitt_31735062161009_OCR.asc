)Days of future past...  

Pitt alumni recall ‘twenty years ago today’

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

Note: News editor Lou Grieco
contributed to this article.

In the year 1969, exactly 9,414
American servicemen were killed
in Vietnam.

At home, 400,000 young people
sang and danced in an upstate
New York meadow forthree days.

Seven lives in California were
reduced to the words “Helter
Skelter” written in blood On their
living room walls by the sadistic
followers of Charles Manson.

Three men Of the Apollo .11
crew guided the Eagle 240,000
miles into space and became the
first men to land on the surface of
the moon. I

And Mary JO Kopechne

in which she and Sen. Ted
Kennedy were riding careened
Off a bridge on the island Of
Chappaquiddick. , .

Despite all Of the extraordina

events that took place in 1969,

 

  

people still found time for the

ordinary things in life, including
having babies. Approximately 3.6
million children were born that
year. Among them are a sizable
majority of those who now make
up Pitt’s junior class.

This generation has reached
the same stage in life that its
parents experienced 20 years
earlier. P_itt' students in 1969
faced many of the same concerns
and confusions college students
face today. But was it somehow
different back then?

“It was a time for beachheads,”
says Scott Baum, Pitt student
government president in 1969, “a
time for standing up and letting
your voice be heard.”

Still, for Baum, it was a time Of
"confusion.

He says, "I attended the rallies

I and demonstrations.” As student
government president, he felt it
was his obligation. His very
presence gave the events a sense
of legitimacy, because of the
nature of his Office. Baumadmits,
however, that he did not play
much of an active role at the
rallies. His support for the
positions which the crowds took
was no more than passive.

“My political and —E moral
convictions were not very
developed atthe time,” Baum
says. A

For him it was not necessarily
a time for standing up for causes.
It was a time for trying to
understand the issues, as well as
himself. With time, experience

and mtxch thought, he eventually
came closer to understanding.
Yet even 20 years of experience
with the issues since 1969 hasn’t
given him the answers.

‘‘I now see the complexity of it
all,” he says. “The solutions aren't
always easy when you’re
ultimately dealing with human
feelings and beliefs.”

Now a psychologist who lives

and works in Manhattan, Baum .

says there was no collective
opinion among Pitt students about
the war in Vietnam. The only
consensus that existed among
them, he says, was a concern for
the country.

“It seems that a much larger
proportion of students thought
they were actively involved in
the life of the country [as Opposed
to today’s studentsl,” says Baum.

David Tiernan, editor in chief
of The Pitt News in 1969,
remembers the split student
opinions. According tO'Tiernan,
anti-war demonstrations were
frequent, but most were not well
attended. .

“IEarlier in the decadel, I think
most students favored the war if
only because it was the
mentality of ‘my country’ at the
time,” says Tiernan.

But, Tiernan recalls, as the war
ran on and the body counts on
the nightly news grew ever higher,
more and more Pitt students
crossed Over into the anti-war
camp.

By December 1969, the total A

number of Americans killed in

Vietnam had surpassed 40,000.

Manson prosecutor reﬂects on "Helter Skelter" crimes

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

On the night of Aug. 9, 1969, actress
Sharon Tate and four others were
slaughtered in what is considered one of
the most brutal murders ofthe20th century.
Tate, eight months pregnant, was stabbed
16 times. The word 'pig" was written in
blood on the doorofherLosAngeles home.

Yhe following evening, Leno LaBianca,
president of a supermarket chain, and his
wife Rosemary were mutilated in a similar
manner in their Los Angeles home.
LaBianca was found with a fork sticking
out of his stomach. On his stomach was
carved the word "WAR. ” "Helter Skelter"
was written on the wall of his home.

The murders sent waves of fear
throughout the Los Angeles area. Three
months later, Charles Milles Manson and
members of his ‘family " would be arrested
for the crimes.

Lasting over9 1/2 months, the trial would
be one of the longest ever. Prosecutor
VincentT.Bugliosi would eventuallyobtain
guilty verdicts, but only aﬂer showing the
motive for the murders as "helter shelter; ”
a racial warthatManson hoped to start by
making it look like black radicals had
killed wealthy whites. Manson assumed
that the blacks would defeat the whites,
and then turn to him for leadership.

At the end of the trial, Manson, Susan
Atkins, Patricia K renwinkeland Leslie Van
Houten would be sentenced to death.
Charles "Tex " Watson and Robert

I Beausoleil would also be sentenced to death

in separate trials. A California state
supreme court ruling would save their
lives.

Bugliosi wrote the best-seller Helter
Skelter abouthiseoqoeriertcesasinvestigator
and prosecutor of the Manson case.

The Pitt News: First off what are you
doing now? I know you wrote a novel in
1987. I
Vincent Bugliosi: Yes, I'm writing two
non-fiction books, one on the Kennedy
assassination [in which] ‘I've concluded
that Oswald acted alone, contrary to what
all the conspiracy buffs have been saying;
as well as 85 percent of the American
people, who have been convinced of a
conspiracy by one conspiracy book after
another for the last 25 years. I'm also
doing a non-fiction book on a fascinating

‘murder mystery that took place back in

1974 on a deserted island in the South
Paciﬁc. I was the defense attorney on the
case. It was tried up in San Francisco on a
change of venue from Honolulu in 1986,
and the verdict was “not guilty.” T ri—Star
and CBS are going to be making a four-
hour miniseries on it.

TPN: Are you still practicing law?

VB: Very little. I mostly write. I’m also
writingan article about drugs that should
be coming out in a month or so, but I’m
very selective in the cases that I take. I've
been quoted many times, but I’ll tell you
again that I haven’t been able to easily

make the transition from a prosecutor to a ‘

defense attorney——— not from a professional
standpoint, but from a psychological
standpoint. I can't get motivated in trying
to defend someone who I think is guilty
of murder or rape, and I just don’t have
any desire to do that. Nine out of 10 of
these people have committed the crime
[they are accused of], so what I do when
a case comes to me is to do my own

investigation, and if it’s obvious that the
person is guilty, I refer him to another
lawyer.

Certainly, if I were the only lawyer
around, I would take these cases no
matter how guilty a party is because the
right to counsel is so sacred in our society,
and more important than what I’ve.been
telling you about my own personal feelings.
But there are so many lawyers, and I
repeatedly refer these cases to other
lawyers.

TPN: About Manson, is the Manson case
historically significant in 1989, or is it
really just a fascinating story, almost like a

freak show?

VB: I think it’s more the latter, fascinating.
It’s, I think, the most bizarre mass murder
case that we've ever had in American
history.

TPN: How come?

VB: Well, If you look at most mass murder
cases, there's some guy who ﬂips out,
goes on a murder spree, and kills 10 or 15
people. Normally the person acts alone.
The Manson case is just completely
different. For one thing, he had other
people killing for him, which is very, very
unusual. That's not common. If you look
for a precedent, you’ll have a tough time
finding another situation where someone
is pulling strings and getting other people
to go out and kill complete strangers for
him. We’ve had contract killings inxour
society; we’ve always had that, like the
mob, killing for pay, but not something
like [the Manson murders].

And there’s Manson himself. He's this 5-
foot-2 guru who goes up to the Haight~
Ashbury district of San Francisco when it
was  a magnet for hippies around the

country. He surrounds himself with a
young bunch of kids from average
American homes, and they get themselves
a black bus, and start traveling up and
down the West Coast. Their lifestyle is sex
orgies and LSD trips. He convinces them
that he is the second coming of Christ and
the devil, all wrapped up in one person.
He told his “family” that Christ was part
devil. Ultimately, he gets them to kill for
him at his command.

And who are these kids who are killing
for him?

If you look at their backgrounds, most
of them came from average American
homes. Again, an extremely bizarre
situation. Most mass murderers don’t have

“ that type of background. Now this Ted

Bundy, that was another interesting case.
He came from that typeof background,

but nine out of 10 mass murderers do not .

have the type of background that the.
Manson family had. »

Another bizarre aspect: most of the
killers were young girls. We've never had
that before in America. We've had women
involved in homicide cases, but never
mass murders.

What’s the motive for these murders? To I

start a war between blacks and whites,

[called] Helter Skelter. At the murder scene,

the killers print words from Beatles songs
in blood. If this didn’t happen, and
someone wrote a ﬁction novel on it, you’d
probably put it downafter a couple of
pages, because it’s so absurd.

I think that’s the main reason for the
fascination in this case. I don’t think that
it’s historically significant, although some
people are treating it that way. They’re

.111-financed...

Can students afford the high cost of being sick? 1

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

Until now, you’ve been fine.
You've always been a pretty

77 healthy person, and being a Pitt

student hasn’t changed that. Oh,

, maybe your roommate gave you

a cold once, or you strained a
muscle jogging in Schenley Park,
but nothing was ever seriously
wrong with you.

This time it’s different. You’ve
had a serious accident, or have
been told at Student Health

1’) Services that you are too sick to

be walking around and need to
be ‘hospitalized. While the
debates about rising medical and
health insurance costs go on in
the political and business arenas,
you are faced with one
inescapable fact: The medical
treatment you need will have to
be paid for. ,

“Most of the Pitt students
coming through here are usually
covered by their parents’ Blue

.1 Cross or commercial health

 insurance plans,” said Valerie Lee,
an admissions interviewer at
Presbyterian University Hospital,
where most of the on-campus
students requiring emergency
care or hospitalization go.
Lee’s job is to help incoming

 patients get through the

admissions procedure, which
involves getting consent for
treatment and determining ability
to pay for the care they'll receive.
Unless the patient is able to
produce a health insurance card,
his or her account is entered into
the hospital billing ﬁles under the
category “self-pay." \
According to Lee, Pitt students
usually indicate that they are
covered by family health
insurance plans, but do not have
the actual cards with them. Such
cases are listed as “self-pay” until
the patients’ families are contacted
by phone to determine the
students’ actual coverage status.
Although Presbyterian hospital is
unable to give any figures on just
how many Pitt students entering
its facility are not covered by
health insurance plans, the
problem of non-coverage does
exist.

 “Some students assume that
they are covered [by health
insurance] when they are, in fact,
not Many students make the
mistake of assuming that Student
Health Services can take care of
all their health care needs,” said
Shirley Haberman, the principle
researcher of the study “A Survey
of Student Health Practices.”

The study, conducted during
the winter term by Pitt’s Health
“Education Office, determined that
approximately 7 percent of all
students surveyed (approximately

8 percent of the undergraduate
and 6 percent of the graduate
student body) were not covered
by any form of health insurance.

_,;_. These low figures, said

- Haberman, may partially reflect

the fact that only those students

concerned with health care issues
participated in the study, which
was carried out by means of a
voluntary questionnaire mailed
to approximately 1,000 randomly
picked students. Forty percent of
the thousand participated,
reflecting, according to
Haberman, a general awareness
of the importance of health care
issues at Pitt.

Even so, the low percentage of
uninsured respondents surprised
Director of Student Health
Services Frank Carter, who was
expecting about 10 percent of all
students surveyed to be
uninsured.

Despite such positive ﬁgures,
Carter is concerned about those
students who are either
knowingly without health
insurance, or have not ever

considered their
situation.

“They’re taking a gamble and
they shouldn’t. It doesn’t take a
very long hospital stay to
financially damage a student,”
said Carter. “We want students to
have insurance for hospitalization
and emergency referral. We want
to send the message that our
[Student Health] services are
limited and that there is a need
for health insu rance.”

Pitt’s Office of Risk Management
annually sends a letter to every
enrolled student urging him to
determine exactly what his
coverage situation is. An attached
brochure warns students that
“Student Health Services is not
prepared to provide care for
students with severe injuries,
extended illnesses, or those who

coverage

require hospitalization. Therefore
it is necessary that each student
have [his] own personal medical
insurance to cover such
conditions.”

Another brochure sent with the
letter gives details of the University
of Pittsburgh Student Health
Insurance Program, a health
insurance plan designed, in the
words of assistant risk manager
Brian Cappo, “to give the students

a comfort level for medical
expenses.”
The plan, which is underwritten

by Peerless Insurance and sold
by Fred S. James & Company of
New England, Inc., offers up to
$2,500 of coverage for accident
and sickness and up to $15,000
in major medical coverage. Cappo
and Carter are both members of
a university health insurance

committee that explores the
student health insurance market
for brokers who offer the best
bid. *

Cappo did not believe that
$15,000 of coverage is enough
for anything serious, such as a
problem pregnancy involving a
30 day hospital stay at $375 a day,
but said that the plan's $327
premium is the best coverage for
the least amount of money.

“Student claims, in general, are ’

minor. [The Pitt plan] is not a
Cadillac policy. [The coverage]
will take care of a minor accident

and about a week’s stay in a —

hospital. Anything more and you
may get into trouble,” said Bill
Devine, account executive for

The museum complex known
as The Carnegie was founded to
represent four disciplines:
science, art, music and literature.
Robert Wilburn, president of the
Carnegie, wants to carry on that
tradition. I

“When Icame here, it was an
institution that I really didn’t know
all that well,” he says. “But the
more I studied the institution and
understood it, the more excited I
became. It’s really unique in the
country. It’s not an institution, it’s

\X/ilburn joined The Carnegie

student health -programs for 50
universities nationwide, including
Pitt.

“You can’t" go without health

insurance,” said Devine. His

figures reflect this need. Of
approximately 1,000 students
enrolled in the Student Health
Insurance Program last year,
between 250 and 300 students
submitted claims, or roughly 30
percent. “‘It’s important for
students to have a general
awareness of potential {financial}
liability if they get injured or sick.
Who’s going to be responsible
for the cost?"

Devine agrees with the notion
that a $327‘annual premium may
be a lot of money for a student
with a limited or non—existent
income, but sees buying health
insurance as deciding whether
the student pays more up front,

»with the premium costs, or in

potential medical bills if
something happens. The
enrollment period for the
university plan lasts through
September with a second period
in January.

Those who decide not to carry
health insurance at all are making
a mistake, according to Jon
Delano, a spokesman for
Congressman Doug Walgren, D-
Pa. Walgren is a member of the
Congressional Health Committee
and is concerned about the costs
of medical care and health
insurance.

Wilburn considers The
Carnegie’s Museum of Art one of
the first museums of
contemporary art in the United
States. “lCarnegiel wanted to
create a museum, in his words,
‘that would show the masters of
the future.’ “

The primary way that the
museum presents contemporary
art is through the Carnegie
International exhibition, which
occurs every three years. In 1988,
the International displayed works
in a variety of media, including
video. One exhibit, titled The
Sleep of Reason, consisted of a
room in which a variety of dream
images were projected onto the
walls, while a television in the
center of the room showed a
woman sleeping.

Other exhibits included a room
made entirely from beeswax, and
another which featured electrical

arcs jumping from terminals.

mounted on the room’s ceiling.
These exhibits represent a current
movement in contemporary art,
and Wilburn wants to see this
reﬂected in ongoing exhibitions.

In a video show last year, the
MOA displayed eight major video-
media artists in special exhibition
halls. “One of them used a Tesla
coil to reproduce a bolt of
lightning in the exhibition,”
Wilburn says.

“That’s the kind of thing that
we would like to do,” he adds.
“You can’t do them too frequently,
because they’re very experts,-zivigjxre.

Pitt to host Soviets
 diplomacy effort

By Jim Tezak
Asst. News Editor

The largest and most eminent
;public diplomacy effort ever
between the United States and
the Soviet Union will take place
when Pitt hosts a conference for
250 Soviet leaders and citizens
from Oct. 29 through Nov. 3.
“Chautauqua at Pitt: The Fifth
General Chautauqua Conference
on U.S.—Soviet Relations" will be

the first such event ever held in a A

major U.S. city;

“The Soviets are hungry for
opportunities; so much more is
open to them now than ﬁve years
ago,” said Diane Saylor, who is
helping to coordinate the event
along with the University Center
for International Studies.

The Soviet delegates will meet
at Pitt with their U.S. counterparts
throughout the week for a series
of lectures and workshops that
will be open to the public. The
conference will also feature joint
evening performances by Soviet
and American musicians.

Topics scheduled to be
discussed at the conference
include trade and economic
relations, the environment, arms
control, regional conflicts, human
rights, space exploration, drug
abuse and women’s and family

issues.

Scheduled U.S. speakers
include former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro,
actress Marlo Thomas, U.S. Sen.
Bill Bradley and actor/
environmental activist Robert
Redford. Pennsylvania Sen. John
Heinz will deliver the opening
address, and on Oct. 30, Phil
Donahue will host an open
dialogue with a format similar to
his television talk show.

The leader of the Soviet
delegation will be Valentia
Tereshkova, the first female
cosmonaut and now the
chairwoman of the Presidium of
the Union of the Soviet Societies
for Friendship and Cultural
Relations with Foreign Countries.

Each workshop during ~ the
conference will feature two U.S
speakers. The U.S. speakers will
share the podium with two Soviet
counterparts.

Holding the conference in
Pittsburgh opens up enormous
opportunities for the Soviets that
were not available at past
Chautauqua conferences held in
the United States, according to
Dr. Bob Donnorummo, acting
associate director for the Center
for Russian and East European
Studies at Pitt.

  Borok conﬁdent

of reserve fund plan

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

Six months after the

' controversial reserve fund was

made public, Student
Government Board Allocations
Chairman Gil Borok is confident
that his plan to use the fund will

. be successful this year.

“I did talk about it, and I am
going to do it,” Borok said. “It’s
almost like a board member doing
a project. It’s something that I've
accomplished.”

The SGB came under criticism

last spring when it was revealed

that there was a bank account
accumulating money from the

I Student Activities Fee for years, \
without any plan for use. The $32

fee is paid by all full-time students
every semester. ‘ I

The reserve fund was set up to
keep a sum that could be used in
case of a budget deficit, and is

taken from the activities fee
money that is allocated to groups,
but not spent by the end of the
year. At this writing, there is
$72,323 in the fund, almost double
what was previously thought.
Under Borok’s plan, a ceiling
figure of $50,000 would be set for
the fund so that there will still be
money in case of budget
problerris, and any extra money
would be funneled back to the
SBG for a proposal for use. If the
amount does not exceed $50,000,
deposits to the fund would be
continued until it did. ’
“I was told by, [Pitt]
administration that what I wanted

to accomplish was {within} my

reach,” Borok said. “Now the
board will meet in September to
make a proposal [about whatl to

do with the [$22,323l.”

The fund has not been tapped
since 1987, when the board

Safety of Regatta improved

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

New measures for increasing
spectator safety were
implemented at this year’s Three
Rivers Regatta by the city of
Pittsburgh, after last year’s tragic
Formula One speedboat

_ accident.

V Seven-year-old James
Herrmannjr. was killed, and 25
others were injured last August
when a speedboat traveling in
excess of 100 miles per hour

swerved off the racecourse and _

ran aground on the north shore
of the Allegheny River near
Three Rivers Stadium.
‘Pittsburgh police said the
accident was a result of the
speedboat hitting wind drafts
and water wakes left by other
boats as they sped along the
race course. 0
“There had never been a fatal
accident at any Formula One

speedboat race before the one
here last year,” said Eugene
Connelly, founder and chairman
of the Pittsburgh Three Rivers
Regatta, which was held Aug.
3-6.

“The accident last year was a
real tragedy, but the race went
on this year as scheduled, and
there were no problems,” he
said.

When planning for the 1989
Regatta, “there were no fears
that what happened last year
would happen again this year,”

Connelly said. “There is always‘

the possibility that a boat will
crash, but we were very
confident that there would be

no spectator injuries with the ,

wall and fencesin place.”
According to Craig Merritt,
Pittsburgh’s assistant director of
public safety, a 3~foot, 18- inch
thick, permanent concrete wall
was constructed along the entire
half-mile length of the

.bank from the tip of Point

Roberto Clemente Park from
the Vietnam War Memorial to’ *-
the Manchester Pier.

Atop the wall on race day
was another three feet of
cyclone fencing to keep the
crowds from crossing the wall
to protect them should any
boats run aground. After the
race, the fencing was removed. '

In addition, a 42-inch-high
chain-link fence was erected
eight feet from the river’s edge
along the _Al1egheny’s south

State Park to the Sixth Street
Bridge. It too was dismantled
after the conclusion of the
race.

The racecourse on the
Allegheny River was also
narrowed to keep the speeding
boats closer to the center of
the river and away from the _
crowds, Merritt said.

‘Always a potential for
trouble,‘ says Brennan

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

The potential for conflict
between students returning for
the fall semester and young
Pittsburgh residents is always
present, but communication and
understanding between the two
could limit possible
confrontations, according to Pitt’s
director of Public Safety.

“There’s always a potential for
troijble,” said Bill Brennan, now
in his eighth month as director.
Potential problems stem from a
September 1986 incident that
resulted in a near riot, when over
100 youths descended on
Oakland and ransacked cars and
assaulted passersby at the
intersection of Forbes Avenue

S and Bouquet Street.

Lesser incidents have also taken
place at other times, but the first
few weeks of classes in September
seem the harbinger for bad

4 sentiment. Returning students

reclaim the" campus that many

youths from the Hill District and‘

other surrounding areas consider
home, and attention is shifted
from the city residents to the
students.

»“It’s two different cultures

1 coming together. What we have

to do now is develop a positive
relationship between students
b and the people of the community

A "E arld“u’37't6’nlake this a partnership,”

Brennan said.
Brennan cautioned that he is
not anticipating any trouble,
‘acknowledging only that the
potential for it is there. Yet he
T realized that the perception in

' many students’ minds is that there

i was violence, once and it could
erupt again. A
“Perceptions are critical,”

 to create a perception that we’re
 all working together." R
Brennan said he hopes to
institute community awareness
and interactive programs with
students, faculty, Campus Police,
Oakland residents and local youth

  Chautauqua

Continued from A-8
Donnorummo says that past
conferences, held at the
Chautauqua Institute in
southwestern New York, were in
an isolated and artificial

‘ ' environment. Being in Pittsburgh

,will give the Soviet citizens a
chance to experience mainstream
American life. . R ‘ A

, Plans are being made to
acquaint the Soviets with
volunteer, cultural, business,
government and education

. systems throughoutthePittsburgh
area. “The Soviets are very much
interested in meeting with people
from our business S community,”
Saylor said.

While the 50 official delegates

' from the Soviet Union will be
i  staying in a hotel, 200 Soviet

citizens will have the opportunity
to familiarize themselves with
American lifestyles by living with

participating. His plans include:

-The creation of an advisory
committee consisting of university
staff, faculty and students.
“Hopefully we can get people
from the community on the
committee, too,” Brennan said.
“I'd like to be the facilitator in that
process.”

-A community awareness day,
involving youth, members of the
Oakland community and the
Campus Police.

like to get some of our people
involved with the Pittsburgh
police and get something going
for these kids,” Brennan said. “It
might be us getting together and
taking -these kids to a ball game,

tor starting an intramural sports

league.”

All events are tentative and
unplanned as yet.

Brennan said that nothing other
than prompting awareness can
be done until a problem breaks
out.

, “Peopleask us why we have
four or five police officers out
there on Friday nights. We have
a responsibility to protect our
staff and students.”

‘ He went ‘on to ‘say that

additional security for the first .

few weeks of classes may not

keep problems from arising.
“We do have a lot of security

out there right now, but that in

itself isn’t going to work. We R
need these pro—active programs.” .
While‘ the Campus Police 

attempt to control on-campus
incidents, they are nearly helpless
when something occurs off-
campus. Those incidents fall into
the jurisdiction of the city police.

conference.

According to Tim Ziaukas,
director of » the Department of
University Relations
communications group, that is
one of the reasons the
Chautauqua conference is so

important.

“It’s really peop1e—to—people,
not government-to— government.
We'll be able to have one—on-
one, person-to-person
discussions,” Ziaukas said.

Donnorummo said he hopes
that such interaction between
Soviet and U.S. citizens will
provide a “better base for more
realistic judgments” about each
other.

“We want as much student
participation as possible. We want
the students to feel like they’re
part ‘of the conference,” Saylor
said. A ..

Asst. News Editor

The Cathedral of Learning was

Z. Klauder, to be “the meeting of

second only to one at the
University of Moscow.

The Cathedral has stood for
over half a century as a symbol of
the university and today is a focal
point of life at Pitt. In 1976, it was

declared a historic landmark. But .
‘there is more to the ‘story of "the

Cathedral of ‘Learning.

The Cathedral is the realization I

of the dream of one man, the late
John Bowman,’ a former

chancellor of the University of

Pittsburgh. ~

When Bowman became
chancellor in 1921, he was faced
with problems of overcrowding
and a poor institutional image.

‘ Bowman envisioned a structure

that would solve both of these
problems’, a skyscraper that would
symbolize power and
achievement, that would “unify
Pittsburgh into a community
conscious of its character.”

The building of the Cathedral,
whose 42 floors enclose over 8
million cubic feet of space, easily
solved the university’s shortage
of space.-The Cathedral houses
110 classrooms and over 1,200
offices.

As for the university’s poor
public image, the city of Pittsburgh
rallied around the building of the

Cathedral. Bowman’s dream was ,

built literally from the pennies of
schoolchildren, 97,000 of whom
contributed 10 cents each to the
Cathedral's building fund. The
Nationality Rooms on the first
floor provided long-lasting ties
between Pitt and the local
community, ties that still exist
today.

“The building was to be more
than a schoolhouse; it was to be
a symbol of the life that Pittsburgh
through the years had wanted to
live," Bowman once said. 0

According to Bowman,
inspiration for what the building
was to look like came one day
when he and Klauder were
listening to the Magic Fire music
from Wagner’s The Valkyries.

“One climax after another,”
Bowman said. “That music is the
building. And it did not get its
height, its meaning, its awful
power by one leap. It took many.
lsn’t each leap a _buttress, a

buttress on a tower?” °

The key word is “choice.”

This, according to Mary H.
Cacali, associate director of
Housing and Food Services,
pertains to the new “Choice
Dollars" meal plan, which enables
a student to eat at certain
restaurants, as well as the
cafeteria. »

“This gives the student more
choice in where and when he
can eat,” she said. “In the past,
the students had to eat in the

, cafeteria, and adhere to the hours

when they served food." Now
they have more options.”
Under the new plan, students
would be allowed to eat at the

Cathedral of Learning, the
Schenley Cafe in the William Pitt
Union _and the Second Plate in

. credit, which will go through the
university to the restaurants for
reimbursement.

Though the standard cafeteria
meal plans are still available,
Cacali said that she feels many
students will take advantage of
the new plan.

“This means increased
convenience for both commuters
and residents. We've even had
some people take both a 19 meal
plan in the cafeteria and a choice
dollars plan.” 6

If you augment a standard meal
plan with choice dollars, you can
buy them in $50 increments.

Though meal plans have always '

been mandatory for freshmen in
the residence halls, this is the first
year it is mandatory for all students

with on—campus housing to have»

a plan. Cacali said that she feels
that this is fair because of the
choice dollars. 0

“In the past, we didn’t want to
restrict anyone by makingthem

said. “Anyway, this has been a
tremendous investment, with
special equipment in these
restaurants, and we’re going to
need to make sure we have
money to back up the investment.
Over 90 percent of resident
students choose meal plans, so
we’re not making them do
anything they don’t want to do.”
Cacali said thatthe university is
also trying to phase out the
kitchens in dormitories that have
them, and that the mandatory

meal plans would help
accomplish that.
“We only havekitchens because

they were in the buildings when
we bought them. We’d rather
remove the kitchens than repair
them when they break.

I “We try to stress Pitt living, not
apartment living. Community
living is the theme, and students
cooking in the residence halls is
more of a fire liability, which
means higher insurance.”

The MOA is also concerned
with presenting more traditional
art, and in the fall, there will be a
show of major Impressionist
artists. “We’ll have about a
hundred Impressionist works,
major works from five museums,”
Wilburn says.

The major changes in The
Carnegie are taking place in other
areas, however. The Buhl Science
Center will be rep1aced_by a
Carnegie Science Center on the
North Side, near the stadium,
because of what Wilburn
describes as “inadequate”

The new science center will
feature a
planetarium and an Omnimax
theater, which consists of a large,
dome-shaped screen, designed
to create a more realistic effect.

there are

University Shop living monument to past

By Matt Martin °
Editor in Chief

 

If Jay McKenzie ever decided
to sell his autograph collection,
he could probably make a pretty
penny. The signatures of Dan
Marino, Bill Fralic, Roger
Kingdom, Tony Dorsett, even Ron
“Opie” Howard are forever
immortalized in his collection of 0
names.

But if you are interested in
purchasing the set, be
forewarned: the University Shop
comes with it.

 

On the walls behind the T-
shirts, sweatshirts, shorts and
other assorted clothing that hang
in McKenzie’s store, snuggled T 6
securely beneath Schenley
Quadrangle on Forbes Avenue,
are the autographs, dating back
to 1963, one year after McKenzie
opened the shop at the age of25.

“It was more of a hangout at

O that time,” says McKenzie. “We

to walk in and see eight or nine
guys just sitting around, talking.
We became a kind of hub for the
university.

“But in 1965, when the football
team was 9~1, and then Kennedy
was assassinated, it kind of threw Q
the Penn State game back. They ’
were 9—1 and uninvited to any
bowl games and it kind of threw
the guys back.”

And then came the autographs.

“One day, they just started
signing,” says McKenzie, pointing
to the wall on your right as you
enter the University Shop. Pitt
stars Paul Martha and Marty
Schottenheimer, now head coach ‘ J,
of the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs,
were among the first to put a
piece of chalk to the easternmost
wall of the store.

“Nobody had ever done '
anything like writing on walls

before, but it just kind of fed on
itself,” says McKenzie.

Since then, the autographs have
expanded from athletes only to
friends, visiting celebrities and .
campus figures,— “The tradition
goes along with Pitt‘s tradition.

"‘It almost becomes a time-warp
type of thing,” says McKenzie. 0
‘‘There’s days you move
something and see an autograph,
and it kind of takes you back.

“Charles Isler, the guy I was
with when the . [Kennedy]
assassination took place, called
me a while ago. People always

AIDS

Continued from A-8
“Understanding AIDS” that “you
won’t getAIDS from saliva, sweat,
tears, urine, or a bowel
movement,” other sources suggest
that it is possible.

According to the American
Society of Internal Medicine, you
should avoid sexual activities that
result in the exchange of bodily

_ ﬂuids, including semen, saliva,

Cit

blood, urine, feces and vaginal
secretions, with a partner who
may be infected.

The Pitt Men’s Study, an AIDS
research project, also warns
against the exchange of ' any
bodily ﬂuid with a person who
could be carrying the AIDS virus.

Tony Silvestre of the Pitt Men’s

Study suggests that the
government is basing its
information solely on known
cases of AIDS transmission.

Although there have been no

known cases of transmission of
the virus through bodily ﬂuids
other than through blood and
semen, Silvestre and other
researchers have not ruled out
the possibility.

“No scientist can say that there
isino risk that the sun will stop
shining tomorrow. Keeping that
in mind, when you ask a scientist,
‘Can I get AIDS from urine?’ he
can’tsay it can never happen,” he
explained.

_ “Understanding AIDS”
informed us last summer that,
while there is presently no cure
for AIDS, drugs like AZT have

prolonged the lives of some AIDS
patients.

It was reported on Aug. 17 that
AZT can also delay the onset of
AIDS in people who have been
infected with the virus but do not
have the symptoms.

A study conducted by the
National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at Pitt and 31

other centers around the US.’

provided this evidence.

Researchers reported that the
people taking AZT in the study
were only half as likely to develop
symptoms of AIDS than those
taking a placebo.

In a year’s time, we witnessed

,“a turning point in the battle to

change AIDS from a fatal disease
to a treatable one,” said Dr. Louis
W. Sullivan, the secretary of
Health and Human Services who
announced the AZT findings in
Washington, D.C.

Although AIDS is not yet a
curable disease, by practicing the
safer behaviors suggested by
researchers and medical
authorities, we can avoid
acquiring and transmitting the
AIDS virus. These behaviors
include sex with one mutually
faithful, uninfected partner,
protected -sex with a latex

condom, not sharing drug
needles, and, of course,
abstinence.

Meal Plan

Continuedfrom A-13

meal ticket office coordinator;

another advantage to the choice
dollars plan is that you don’t have
to worry about losing meals
during the week. “If you don’t
use all o_f the meals you have for

a week, you lose them. With,

choice dollars, you can spend at
the rate you choose.”

If you don’t spend all of the
dollars you put into the plan by

- the end of the fall semester, they

carry over to the next term, even
though residents without cafeteria

, plans willstill have to spend at

least $250 for that term. However,
money not spent by the end of
the winter term will not be
refunded.

“The administration costs of
returning the money would be
high,” Cacali said. “Also, making
the money returnable takes away
the ‘mandatory’ part of the meal
plans.

“You’re going to know how
much money you have left. At
the end of the year, you can get
together with your friends, buy a
couple of buckets of chicken
from Roy Rogers [with your choice
dollars], and have a picnic.”

The project was spearheaded
by the combined efforts of student
government board members
Anastasia Kawalec and Elissa
Klein.

“We wanted to offer something
different than just eating in the
cafeteria,” said Kawalec.

Bars

Continued romA-10 .
night, with re uced prices for

bottles of imported beer.
Wednesday nights atPeter’s attract
some of the largest crowds at any
Oakland bar. Finally, Thursday
features inexpensive pitchers of
beer.

Caleco’s is an Oakland bar with

. a touch of the Irish. It has both an

upstairs and downstairs bar and
features a daily happy hour from
4 to 6 p.m. Owner Tom Carey
takes special pride in the
momentos that he has acquired
to decorate the bar: the walls of
Ca1eco’s are adorned with
nostalgic pictures. Rock is the
typical music, with a DJ usually
present to take requests.

Bartender Kelly Hudock said
that Caleco’s has a large. regular
clientele and a close group of
employees. “Everyone who
works here seems to end up
living lwith one another, We
have a close—knit group." St.
Patrick’s Day and Pitt-Notre Dame
football games are the most
celebrated days at Caleco’s.

Weekday specials are
inexpensive pitchers on
Tuesdays, and wings along with
imports on Wednesdays.

C. J. Barney’s and Zelda’s,
located on opposite corners of
the “O,” are true student hangouts.
Each bar features weekday
specials, the most popular day
being Thursday, when drafts are
at reduced prices. C.j.’s has an
adjoining restaurant, and Zelda’s

has a kitchen that serves wings
and pizza that it will deliver.

“I occasionally go to Zelda’s
because I can always meet people
there that I know,” said senior
Mike Mandzak. “It’s a great place
to socialize, especially on
Thursday nights.”

Two more bars that are
frequented by students are
Mitchell’s and Thirsty’s. Both are
located in North Oakland on
Centre Avenue. Mitchell’s is
popular on Mondays for low-
priced drafts, and Thirsty’s is
renowned for “Dead Night” every
Wednesday. Reduced—price
Budweiser -is served and only
Grateful Dead music is played.

Thirsty’s also offers wings on
Thursday nights. There are only

two types —— mild and wild. If y,
you don’t like hot food, stick with

the mild.

Two other North Oakland bars
are the Luna and Chiefs. Chiefs
is renowned for having a very
mixed crowd and some of the
lowest drink prices in Oakland.

Traveling in the opposite

direction to South Oakland, one ’

can ﬂnd Denny’s and the SOD.
For those who want a traditional

tavern, with the coolest fish tank
in Oakland, Denny’s is on Louisa

Street.

The biggest night for the SOD
is Thursdays, which is wing night.
Wednesdays will be lasagna night
this fall.

Delano believes it is essential
for students to find out exactly
what their medical expense
coverage situation is and to get
coverage if it is needed.

But you already knew that,
didn't you? As you wait to be
treated in the hospital, signing
forms you don’t really know the
answers to, you remember a letter
you got from the university at the

beginning of the year about

insurance. You remember putting
it somewhere where you’d be
sure to be reminded to ask your
family about your health
coverage. But somehow the
subject never came up. Why
should it have? Up to now you've
been ﬁne. '

of U.S. military mobilization in
Vietnam —— 535,000 troops.

Anti-war demonstrations also
reached a peak that year, when
on Nov. 15, 3PProximate1y
250,000 people marched on
Washington, D.C.

“I can’t stress enough how
confrontational those times were, ”
says Baum. “There were a lot of
bad things said about the people
in the anti-war and counterculture
movements."

He remembers that on one
occasion, hecklers shouting at
the anti-war protesters from the
sidewalks might have “torn them
limb from limb” if police had not
been present.

“There was a lot of bitterness
and rancor between children and
parents,” says Joseph Belavich,
class of ’69. “Most of the students
were against the war. Our parents
were all for it. And all of the kids
hated Nixon.” I

Now a dentist in Tampa, Fla.,
Belavich remembers that “they

were rough times. During that .

time period, I had at least 20
friends go over [to Vietnam]. Some
of them didn't come back, and
some came back wounded. None
of those who came back would
[willingly] go back.

“The only person I talked to
who had been over there and

one in the Army, Marines, or any I

of the ground troops thought the
war was right.

“The guy in the Air Force
thought it was right, but he-was

conditioning, and in the winter
there was heat.

Continued from A-4
saying that it was the end of the
hippie period, the end of
innocence, et cetera. The reason
I don’t think it’s that historically
significant, if you look at it more
closely, is because I don’t think
that these people were hippies,
nor do I think that they reﬂect the
period. Now the late ’60s was
definitely an anti-establishment
period, a counterculture period.
But these so-called hippies, or
whatever you want to call these
people who dropped out and
were looking for a new social
order, they wanted to bring it
about by peaceful means. Manson
comes along, and wants to change
the status quo by murder and
violence. and he himself said he
was not a hippie. You can call us
slippies, he said, we slip into
peoples’ homes at night, but not
hippies, because he equated that
with paciﬁsm. But I do think the
late ’60s were a mu ch more fertile
period for someone like Manson
to emerge.

Cathedral

Contirmedfrom A-19

As architect, Klauder struggled
for 15 frustrating years to help
make Bowman's dream a reality.
Eventually, the dream became
his as well.

Shortly before his death in 1938,

. Klauder wrote a letter to Bowman

which said, “You will realize, I
am sure, that I am trying to express
my appreciation for this
opportunity which you have
afforded me to put into tangible
form my creative desires.”

Today, the Cathedral rises as a
monument to the past, and a
beacon lighting the way toward
the future. Many freshmen use it
as a guiding landmark on their
campus maps, too.

TPN: Because of the anti-
establishment feelings?

VB: Yes, but I don’t think he
reﬂected the anti—estab1ishment.
According to surveys at the time,
when the media talked to young
people they had labeled hippies,
these young people disavowed
Manson, and said that he did not
reﬂect their beliefs at all. Even
some of the underground
newspapers, which are very

. iconoclastic, attacked Manson. '

TPN: What do you feel are the
chances of any of the family
members in jail getting parole?

VB: The one who has the best
chance is Leslie Van Houten,
because she was not involved in
the Tate murders. All of the others
were convicted of a minimum of
seven murders. She’s been

convicted of two murders, so I-

would say that she has the best
chance. The others, because
they’re in the state of California,
I think they have achance of

getting out, with the exception of ‘

Manson.

TPN: Why is that?

VB: Well, California does not have
a good track record in keeping
convicted murderers behind bars.
The example I frequently give is
Sirhan Sirhan, who murdered
Senator [Robert] Kennedy. He was
going to get out, it wasn’t a parole
hearing — they had a release date
for him in 1984! It surfaced that
he had allegedly told a co—inmate
of his that when he got out, if no
one else killed Ted Kennedy, he
was going to do it. And because
of that they set aside his parole.
But they were going to let Sirhan
out!

Now if these people were in a
southern state, like Florida, Texas,
Arkansas, where they throw away
the key, then you wouldn’t even
have to ask the question. But in
California, you do have to ask the
question.

Now Manson, on the other
hand, is so notorious that it would
create such an uproar that even
in the state of California, my
feeling is that he probably will

spend the rest of his life behind
bars. I think that the female
defendants and Watson probably
will be getting out in 15 or 20
years, but I have no inside
information on it. It’s just my
feeling that, 15 or 20 years from
now, I wouldn’t be surprised [if
they were released}.

TPN: Sandra Good and Steven
"Clem ” Grogan have both been
paroled. How do you feel about
that?
VB: Well, Sandra Good was not
involved in any murders, so her
parole after she served an
appropriate period of time does
not seem incorrect.

Grogan was convicted of one
murder, and again, in California,
he served a typical period of
time. I would rather have seen
Grogan behind bars for a longer
period of time. Of all the members
of the family, he was the most
demented, as it were, and I think

he is a very dangerous person,
but again, he only committed
one murder. V
TPN: What about the death of
Ronald Hughes? The reason I ask
is that a recent article by
Associated Press reporter Linda
Deutsch has him described as a
drowning victim. [Hughes,
defense attorney for Leslie Van
Houten, disappeared in November
19 70, right before closing
arguments. His corpse, found four
months later, was too badly
decomposed foran autopsy report
to give the cause of death]
VB: What’s the date of that article?
'I'PN: Sunday, Aug. 6, 1989. Is
there anything new on Ronald
Hughes? I
VB: Well, my belief is that Hughes
was murdered, although I don’t
have any conclusive evidence of
this. Sandra Good, shortly after
the trial, said that he was the first

of the retaliation murders. I think I
mentioned that in Helter Sleelter, the
implication being that he was murdered.

Then, a couple of years later — this is not
in the book — a former member of the
Manson family, though. not a hard-core
member, called me. He wants to remain
anonymous, and understandably so. I had

' a telephone conversation with him and he

told me’ that the Manson family had
murdered Hughes. Now, I don’t have any
conclusive evidence, but it is my feeling
that Hughes was murdered by the Manson
family.

TPN: What about an update on Donald
“Shorty ’* Shea, joel Dean Pugh or or john

Phillip Haught? Grogan was convicted of V
. the murder of Shea. Did they ever find

Shea ’s body?

VB: Yes, they found Shorty Shea’s body. It
was out on Spahn Ranch, and it was not,
as the Manson family tried to give the
impression, that he was buried in nine
separate places. That was not true. /Shea
was a ranch hand and aspiring actor at
Spahn, where the Manson family lived
during the period of the Tate-Labianca

Ileillingsl ‘

TPN: What about foel Dean Pugh or john
Phillip Haught? Has anything new come
up on that? [Both men were listed as
suicides, though under suspicious
circumstances. Some suspect them to be
victims of the family.l ’
VB: No

TPN: Still just mysterious deaths?

VB: Yes, right.

TPN: How prevalent is the family today?'Is
there any structure to it, or has it really
evaporated 20 years later?

group today that I know of, on the outside,
that keeps the ﬂame alive. The last group
on the outside was when Squeaky and
Sandra Good were living in Sacramento,

which ‘is about 30 miles from Folsom,

where Manson was. They were trying to
recruit members into the family, and they
weren’t very successful, because without
Manson there was no charisma. They
brought one girl into the family, a part-
time nurse, Susan Murphy, I think her
name was. /Murphy,” Fromme and Good
lived together in Sacramento in the early
1970s while they planned threats and
attacles on corporate executives] She’s

behind bars now, and Sandra Good
eventually was convicted. And of course,

Squeaky was convicted in the attempted
assassination of President Ford.
TPN: Did that shocle you?
VB: The attempted assassination? No,
because the Manson family likes to do

shocking things. That’s their ammo, so

that did not shock me.

Anyway, Manson still corresponds with
several members of his family, but they’ve
gone their separate ways. There ’s no group,
as I say, in a cohesive unit on the outside.

Plus, several members of the family
have renounced Manson. Now, whether
their renunciation is sincere or not, or
whether they just think that it’s easier to
get a parole if they’re separated from
Manson, I don’t know. But Atkins has

renounced him, Leslie Van Houten has,

Tex Watson has. But some of them are still
in contact with Manson. .

TPN: Some of the lesser-known ones?
VB: No, Patricia Krenwinkel is still close to
Manson, as far as I know. Squeaky is still
very, very close.

VB: My guess is yes on that. Very deﬁnitely.

TPN: Whatabout Grogan? Whathappened
to him?

VB: I don’t know what happened to

Grogan. ‘

Incidentally, have you read this week’s

Star magazine?

TPN: N0.

VB: Well they’ve located Pooh Bear, [whol
is Manson’s son. There’s a photograph of
him and everything. Now, he doesn’t like
his father, he doesn’t want -to see him or
hear about him, because he feels that
Manson is a very evil person. He was the
son of Manson and [family member] Mary
Brunner.

Most of these kids were put into foster
homes and their records were sealed, but
Pooh Bear was not. As far as I know, he
grew up with Mary Brunner’s parents. But
he’s about 21 years old now. That’s an
interesting little footnote.

TPN: Should these people be paroled?

VB: No, I don’t think so, because .you’ve
got to realize that they were originally
sentenced to death, and then the Supreme
Court in 1972 set aside the death penalty,
not just for the Manson people but there V
were about 600 people on deathgrow at
the time. The case was Furman v. Georgia,
and they held that the death penalty was
unconstitutional, not per se, but the way it
was being carried out by the courts, and
they made their ruling retroactive. [On
Feb. 18, 19 72, the Califomia StateSupn9me
Court announced that they had abolished
the death penalty on the grounds that it
was unconstitutional. Even though
California has since reinstated the death
penalty, the fact that Furman v. Georgia is
retroactive means that death sentences

But, say that they are completely
rehabilitated, and I have no evidence of
that, and I thinkthat someone like Manson
is beyond rehabilitation,
redemption. Even making that assumption,
if justice means anything in America, it just
seems to me that they should spend the
rest of their lives behind bars. I mean, you
shouldn’t be able to murder seven, eight
and nine people. In fact, the figure that the
Manson family uses, though they were not
convicted of this, the figure that they use
is 35. They say “We offed 35 people.” But
Manson has been convicted of nine
murders,_Susan Atkins eight, Watson and
Krenwinkel seven, and even if they’re
rehabilitated, that’s not the only reason we
put people behind bars. We put people
behind bars for retribution, which is a
valid, normal, human instinct. And also for
deterrence, to deter other people from

doing it. So I don’t think they should ever I
‘get out, no.

TPN: What do you think caused people to
followManson? Was it drugs, charisma, or
some combination?

VB: I thinkit was a combination of things.
Certainly drugs played a role; LSD, which
is a mind—altering drug. I think sexual

perversion played a role. A new girl would '

join the family, he would induce her to
have sex with another girl, or a boy with
a boy, and it was pretty obvious what he
was trying to do. He was trying to break
down their egos, their pride. a

I would say the key» factor, other than '

Manson himself, which I’ll get to in a
moment, inenabling him to get control of
these people, was his preaching to them
— on a day—to-day basis, in an isolated

looking for ammunition to defame
and embarrass the anti-war youth
movement, according to Baum.

But they found no ammunition
in the three-day music festival
known today as Woodstock.

“The feeling  I remember was

that this was a sort of natural
turning of events,” says Baum.

“I didn’t go,” says Belavich. “It
wasn't supposed to be that big,
and after it happened, it was like
‘Wow, that was really something.’

“Itsymbolized freedom to all
of us — a freedom to do as we
would without having to worry
about the consequences,” says
T iernan.

He and some friends were
traveling in that part of the country
when they first heard of the
concert on the radio news.

“The publicity at the time was

' all very positive,” he says. The

broadcasts emphasized how
many people were there, and
that there were few, if any,

incidents of violence. >

He and his friends did not stop
at the concert, something he
regrets very much.

A week before those three
musical days in August of 1969, at
the opposite end of the country,
there were two harrowing nights
of murder. 1 ,

Originally known as the Tate-
LaBianca murders, they were later
nicknamed the Manson murders,
after cult leader Charles Manson.
The fact that none of the seven
victims were killed by Manson

himself, but by his young.

followers, suggested the‘
susceptibility of naive American
youth to a charismatic, streetwise
ex—convict. A V

If Woodstock wasn’t
ammunition for opponents of the
youth culture, the Manson
murders surely were. For those
who wanted to believe it, the
Manson murders were the

    

inevitable culmination of young
America's obsession with drugs,
music and debauchery.

Baum disagrees.

“Manson was totally unrelated
to everything else going on at the
time,” he says.

In the autumn of 1969, Pitt was
abuzz with stories of Woodstock
and the Manson murders were
rarely mentioned, he adds.

“lThe killings] had an impact,”
Belavich contradicts. “In that age
group of males, Sharon Tate was
a well-known person, though as
an actress, I guess she didn’thave
that big of a career. '

“[Film director] Roman Polanski
[Tate’s husband] was a neat type
of guy. Theselwere neat people
who were more attuned to us
than the establishment, so the
murders did have an impact.”

Belavich agrees with Baum,
however, that Manson was not
indicative of the state of the hippie
nation in 1969. :

“He was on the fringe. He was
just a crazy lunatic.”

Even with the mass marketing
of the late-’60s counterculture in
1989, not everyone feels nostalgic
about the events of that year. 3

“The music was the only good
thing going on among the young
people back then,” recalls Lucille
Adkins, Pitt student in the late
'60s and early ’70s, now registrar
of the Pitt Law School.

According to her, those who
used the most drugs in the '60s
were the youngest of the young,
those in their late teens and early
20s. This group had the largest
number of overdoses.

Adkins says that she and her

friends 1 at the time were so

politically active that they thought A

it was a waste of time to take hard
hallucinogenic drugs.‘ Marijuana,
however, was a different story.
“Marijuana was more of a
recreational thing,” she says. “It
was very much a part of the
revolutionary spirit of the time.”

The government said “no” to

said “yes.” According to Adkins,

while they were still alive in
America. ..

V On July 18, 1969, a car driven
by Ted Kennedy went off a bridge,
and a young woman drowned.

Though Kennedy has been re-
elected to the Senate several times
since then, many feel that the
night at Chappaquiddick cost him
the presidency.

“It affected me, in that I saw a
career come to an end,” says
Belavich. “The Kennedys were
like magic in that time. I think he
had a really good chance [for the
presidencyl.”

“It was the end of an era, the
end of innocence,” says Adkins.
“That's the only way you can say
it. The Kennedys were like a
dynasty with power passing [from
brother to brother].

“I had worked on the Bobby
Kennedy campaign [in 1968], and
when he was killed, every ounce
of motivation to change things

was killed in me. I almost saw ‘

Bobby as a savior. Then Teddy’s
time to shine was taken away
from him.”

Belavich says that he still doesn’t
have any doubts about Ted
Kennedy’s -abilities.

“My wife andlsaw him in the
Senate last summer, and he was

very presidential. lWhen he‘ '

walked on the ‘Senate ﬂoor, there
was a certain regalness; he had
an aura of respect and awe. _

hearing [in the ’60s] that Teddy

was the best of the Kennedys. It 

was like, ‘If you thought Jack was
good, and Bobby was O.K., wait
until Ted got older. He was

supposedly the most intelligent, '

charismatic, popular— the one
who could get things done.

“There was a sense of sadness
and finality to “Chappaquiddick.
It was like, ‘There won't be any
more Camelots.’ “

In .1969, 54 percent of Pitt’s T

students had never heard of the

Black Action Society, according '

,1 to a campus poll taken that year.

When Joseph McCormick, a
senior in 1969, first came to Pittin
1965, there were 14 other blacks
on campus. According to
McCormick, there was not even
one black faculty member.

“Some of us felt an acuity to the
fact that there were so few black ,
at Pitt,” he says. “In retrospect, at.
age 41, that’s not a big deal to me 
anymore, but in 1969, it was a 1
very big deal.”

On Jan. 15, 1969, McCormick
and approximately 25 other
blacks took a stand.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 28, I989

1969

Continued from A-22
recruitment and more ﬁnancial
aid to encourage black students
to attend Pitt.

McCormick says the lock-in was
not nationally publicized as well

I as other protests had been.

Locally, however, the protesters
received the full attention of the
media. The day following the
lock-in, The Pitt News printed a
special issue devoted exclusively
to the incident and the campus’
reaction.

“A lot of what went on in those
days was emphasized because of
the explosion of media coverage, ”
T iernan says of The Pitt News.
“Any time there was even a small
group of students  rallying for a
cause, news people would be
close by.” I

To Tiernan, the name of the
game for protesters in 1969 was
“manipulate the media.”

Looking back, McCormick calls
their lock—in a success, despite
the lack of national media
coverage. Now a political science
professor at Howard University
in Washington, D.C., McCormick
says, “The I University of
Pittsburgh, racially, is a different

place than it was back then.”

He points to the 20-year-old
Black Studies Department at Pitt,
which saw its genesis soon after

the protest, and the increase in ,

black enrollment as examples of

this Change. .

“Many whites and blacks really

did try to understand each other
and break down the barriers that
had divided us for so long,” Baum
says of the civil rights movement
of the late ‘60s. “I’m sorry to say,
though, that most of those barriers
still exist today.

“Of all the unrealized goals of
our generation, I think the
realization that we were unable
to narrow the gap between blacks
and whites is the most haunting,
at least for me,” he adds.

C O O

The percentage of students
voting in student government
elections was not very different
from today. In 1969, 15 percent
of Pitt’s students voted, compared
to 10 percent in 1988. Not
everyone was on the reform
bandwagon that seems to

. characterize the era.

But those who were a part of it,
and the efforts they made, are
remembered.

“It was growing up during the
Cold War that made our
generation the way lit wasl,” says
Adkins. According to her, it was
the experience of rehearsing for
nuclear bombing raids dozens of
times in grade school that made
them afraid of governments -
especially their own. A

“Eventually we all wondered
who could possibly be so cruel as
to do that to other people?” she
says. “Life was not cute little
houses with cute little dogs like
we saw on T .V. Life was a 100-

mile radius bomb disaster."

Vietnam served to bring the
fears of war to a personal level.
“Many young ‘people faced a
serious decision about life and
death,” according to Adkins, and
this was the focal point of the
counterculture movement.

Belavich feels these sentiments
are still alive today, and that they
are reﬂected in various Vietnam
era movies, like Good Morning
Vietnam. “Robin Williams is a
funny guy,” says Belavich, “and
there are some really funny parts
in Good Morning Vietnam, but I
could not go see it again. It struck
too close to home. '

“I was not surprised at what I
saw in Platoon or Full Metaljacket,
because my friends had told me
even more about the rapes,
tortures and shooting of children.
However, Good Morning
Vietnam was different.

“It captured a sentiment. Like
when Robin Williams saw the
troops going to battle. He knew
what they were going into, and
there was nothing he could do
about it. There were all these
young, healthy, basically decent
American kids, and a lot of them
weren't going to come back. It
was like helplessness.”

“We tried to take on the whole
damn world,” Adkins says. “It
was this far—reaching idealism that
burned everyone out.”

Baum also admits that he
became very frustrated and, for

the most part, gave up on the
ideals that he had been forming
in 196?.

“With the Reagan years, many
of us got wrapped up in the
money-making culture of the
’80s,” Baum says.

Baum feels that since 1969, the
counterculture generation has
been preoccupied with work and
children, but as it ages, he believes
it will gradually return to its old

_ activisrns.

“Those people and their ideals
are still there,” he says, “waiting
for their long—dormant idealism
to be reawakened.” I

A It was just a step.

However, in the words of
astronaut Neil Armstrong, it was
“one small step for man, one
giant leap for mankind.”

Just twodays after the accident
that darkened the career of one
of his brothers, President John F.
Kennedy's dream came true.
Armstrong became the first man
to walk on the moon. The late
president had promised to beat
the Soviets in the race to the
moon by the end of the decade.

Adkins remembers the event
as an inspiration in an era of too
many tragedies. \

, “The moonwalk was absolutely
exhilarating. I was crying, and all
of the people I was with were

crying. Walter Cronkite was crying .

on TV, and the astronauts who
were helping him [on the
broadcast] were crying. The whole
world was crying.

“It meant so much to me. I
thought, ‘By God, we're greater
than what we’ve become. We
can accomplish so much.’ If only
we could take that spirit and
apply it here, I knew everything
would be cool.”

Belavich says that although it
was good for him, there was
controversy over even this event.

“We were into social awareness,
and some people were asking,
‘Why are we spending money to
put three guys on the moon when
several millions in the world can't
eat?’

“However, it doesn’t mean that
wasn’t a great thing that
happened. Putting someone on
the moon doesn’t necessarily
mean you’re mistreating other
people. So I thought it was great.
I was thrilled.”

Adkins agrees. “I feltwe had to
do this [the moonwalk]. We hadn’t
done anything great all those
years. It was like when President
Kennedy died, and everything
stopped for ﬁve days. Except this
was positive. ‘

“When you were waiting for
the final landing [on] the moon,
everything stopped. For a short
while, it seemed like there were
no problems in the world.”

store stopped.

“And when I was a kid, if
somebody mentioned Joe
DiMaggio or Ted Williams, we
were amazed. Nowkids come in
and are mesmerized by the
autographs. They ask, ‘Whe_re’s
Dan Marinb? Where's Jimbo
Covert2’. It’s worked in the past
few years. People come in and
start talking to you and say
‘Where's my name?’ It’s funny
how you can look at people and
just know." ‘

As the tradition has grown, the
context in which the names have
been signed has changed, says

. McKenzie.

“Back in the early 1960s,
football was just a game. It’s
changed. It’s a more serious thing
now. We ask people to sign their
names, or they Come in and ask.”

McKenzie has had his share of
unusual autographs. “The most
unusual is probably this Chinese
or Laotian name,” he says,
‘pointing to some characters high
on the south wall.

And there's one signature he
can't explain, underneath the
ventilation shaft in the rear of the
store.

“We have a Frank Zappa up
there. I don’t know if it’s, real or
if someone else signed it. That
was during weird times.”

Employee Sandy Bergad adds,
“We also had all the old-time
Pirates” from 1963, when the

baseball team played at Forbes
Field, now the location of Forbes
_ Quadrangle, “but we had a water
leak and it wiped them all out.”
‘Still, the most meaningful
autographs to McKenzie are those
that take him back to the early- to
mid-1960s and “the people who
didn't make it,” as he calls those
people who weren't necessarily
athletes. or’ visitors, but special
friends. " "

is “You have more of .a,,

relationship with those people,
and I think it’s neater now when
they come back and the signature
is still there.

‘“It’s like when you were a kid

putting your name in fresh .

cement. When you're 40 years
old, you walk by and don’t want
anybody to see you, looking at it.
This you come back to and protect
and nurture."

He reaches behind the store
counter and produces a handful

I of business cards. “People come

3 in and give these to me all the

tirne,” he says. “They say, ‘ If you a

see so and so, tell them I'm in
Winnipeg,’ “ Or Santa Monica,
Phoenix, or even as far away as
Switzerland and Saudi Arabia,
according to the cards.
“You’ll have people come up
and ask if you’ve heard from this
_ person, and it’s unbelievable
because you have,” says

0 McKenzie.

“And I can't think of a place
I've been where someone doesn't
say, ‘Gee, you look familiar, are
you from Pittsburgh?’ and it turns
out that they went to Pitt.”

So while the customers may
come to see the autographs of
Qorsett, Green, Fralic, Kingdom
and others, McKenzie is content
to stay with the east wall and the
old memories.

setting; I think the isolated setting
is very important. Most of these
cult leaders are shrewd enough
to realize that their perverse
philosophies on life are not going
to be able to survive in the so-
called marketplace of ideas, so
they deliberately quarantine their
followers. This guy Jim Jones [a

But I think the most important

induced ,

factor is an intangible factor: it's
the power of Manson’s
personality, and the evil genius
of Manson.

'I'PN: Did you sense that when
you dealt withhim?

VB: No, I didn’t sense it, but
you’ve got to realize that he was
a heavyweight in the world in
which he moved, and that was
the off-beat, drop-out world of
the hippie. In our world, he would
not be a heavyweight. But inthat
world he was a heavyweight.

Now why that’s so is hard to
figure out. There was something
intangible about him in that world.

Wherever he went, kids seemed.

to congregate around him, and
within a short time they were

following him. It’s intangible; you

he’s there. Then someone else
can walk into that room, probably
without a penny in his jeans, and
somehow you can sense his
presence. Now, why that is, I
don’t know. You’ve heard the
terms aura, vibes.

Now I’m not going to get into
that, but there is a phenomenon
there, Manson, in his world, and
I have to underline those words

~—— in his world — he was a

heavyweight; wherever he went,
kids followed him. I mean, there
were times there when he had 50
or 60 young people following
him around. So he was
charismatic in his world. When I
say “evil genius,” he is very bright,
there’s no question; about it, but
I'm not referring to him as a
genius in terms of high IQ. I’m
talking about his ability to detect
weaknesses and fears in people,
and exploit those weaknesses
and fears. Also, his ability to
discern what other people wanted
to see in him, and thenput on a
separate mask for each person.
His family called him a
Changeling. He himself said he
was a man of a thousand faces.
He was constantly changing to fit

the occasion and person who he
was talking to. In that sense, he
was an evil genius. I would think
that he is the main reason why all
this happened, but there were
those other things.

Also the late ’60s. I don’t want
to minimize the late ’60s. I think
that was important. I just want to
italicize that he did not reﬂect the
1ate,’60s. ’ _
TPN: Was it diﬂicult to prosecute
Manson and the family?

VB: The most difficult thing was
to gather the evidence. Once we
got to trial, I,didn’t think that it
was that tough, but it was much
more difficult than the usual case
to gather the evidence, and I was
very involved inthe investigative
process. ‘
TPN: How come itwas so difficult?
VB: Well, no one wanted to talk.
Like someone said, Manson may
be behind bars, but his reach
extends beyond the jail cell.’ I
remember taking Danny DeCarlo
up to I Spahn Ranch. Danny‘
insisted on being handcuffed
because there were still family

members out there. [He was a

member of the Straight Satans
motorcycle gang who stayed with

Manson atspahn Ranch. DeCarlo
wanted to loole like he had been
arrested so th at Ma nson wouldn ‘t
lenowhe’d cooperated with police]
Then there was Juan Flynn, /a
Spahn ranch hand and witness
for the prosecution] who wanted
to be incarcerated, and I said
“Juan, you haven’t done anything
wrong.” And‘ he said we’d just
come up with something. I think
we came up with drinking beer
in the desert with an open
container, to put him behind bars.
He didn’t feel safe anywhere else.
Another difficult thing was that
Manson was the main defendant.
To convict the others and have

_[him walk out of court would
‘ have been an unsuccessful

ail

prosecution. And he was not at ‘

the scene [of the crimes]. Sol had ./

to bring him in by way of‘

circumstantial evidence, and the ‘

two main ways that I brought him
in was first of all, to find the
motive and determine that only
he was behind this‘ motive. It

turned out to be Helter Skelter. I

He preached it to the family, and
therefore when Helter Skelter was

do. Fortunately, and I say
fortunately not because their
motivations are good, but because
they are better than Manson’s,
they are into things like exploiting
these kids sexually or taking their
money from them, and things
like that. Manson was into murder.

Someone; like [Unification
Church of America leader Rev.
Sun Myung] Moon probably could

have manipulated some of his

followers to kill, but was more
interested in gettingta yacht. So
Manson is unique, not just in his
ability to manipulate, butbecause
he was extremely evil. Those
who can manipulate like him are
often more likely to have different
goals than Manson.

‘As someone who lived with
Manson and knew him better

than I did, Paul Watkins la family
associate who turned on Manson]
said, “Death is Charlie’s trip.”
When you find both of these
characteristics in a person, you
have a Manson, or a Hitler. I kind
of view Manson as sort of a mini-
Hitler.

TPN: Is there anything we can
learn from this case, besides
“Watch your back”?

VB: [1aughs]There’s an old saying
that nothing_’s new under the sun.
I'm not sure that anything
emerged from this case that we
didn’t knowybefore. I think it’s a
reaffirmation that when people
turn over ' their minds to an
authoritarian I figure, whether its
on the far left or far right, the
potential for this type of madness
exists. K

said, “but we both have
jurisdiction on campus. The
university spares no expense for
the students’ safety.”

Former director of security and
current assistant Walt Waters said
that the residents of Oakland are
not the ones causing the
problems, nor have they ever
been. . ‘

“The Oakland area is somewhat
unique. There are very few
neighborhood children. Mostly

, there are students and the older

type of person. There really aren't
any Oakland gangs, ” Waters said.

Regarding the tumult in 1986,
Brennan said, “We checked into
that and we found out that it
wasn't just youngsters from the
Hill but from all around.”

“You may find that some of the

Waters quipped. .

Brennan said that one of the
most tense times is during Pitt
home football games.
university hires city officers to
work the games, and also
increases the number of campus

Brennan is pleased with the

AIDS laws should inspire caution, not panic

AIDS is a problem that has been prominent in

\ the public eye for some time now. The Pennsyl-

vania House of Representatives will be spend-
ing time this fall voting on various items of
AIDS-related legislation; and, as reported in In
Pittsburgh, the American Civil Liberties Union
has issued a blacklist, naming some house bills
*hat it finds objectionable.’ 1 ,

Several of the bills deal with mandatory AIDS
testing. Some are clearly unnecessary. For

1 example, House Bill 278 calls for testing of food

handlers and firefighters, among others. HB 280
requires the testing of schoolchildren.

 Yet AIDS cannot be transmitted through cas-

ual contact. A bill that promotes paranoia and
incorrect assumptions about an issue as serious
as AIDS is reprehensible; it plays the tune that

’ people panic to. A responsible legislature should

condemn such ignorant, fear-inspired responses.
Both of the above-mentioned bills were spon-
sored by_an Allegheny County representative,
Fred Trello, who obviously has made a point of
remaining uninformed about the disease in
question. This shows his lack of the responsibil-
ity needed to hold a position as a leader of
people. ' .

Other bills are equally paranoiac and border
on hysteria: one bill defines the crime “assault
by AIDS carrier,” another calls for the notifica-

,, {lion of a school principal of a child in his school

testing HIV-positive. These steps achieve noth-
ing; these are not instances where there is a

demonstrable medical risk of AIDS transmis-
sions.

, Not all of these bills lack merit, however, even
though the ACLU decries them.HB 624 calls for
mandatory testing of convicted prostitutes, and
a prison sentence for HIV-positive prostitutes
who are convicted again. This is a high-risk
profession, and if a prostitute is willfully spread-
ing a major health risk to his or her customers,
a stricter punishment is called for.

One bill calls for mandatory testing of sex
offenders, while another makes the act of a
known HIV-positive donating contaminated
blood a crime. These are also reasonable.
Victims of sexual abuse have a right to know if
they have been exposed. And donating HIV-
positive blood (or knowingly exposing some-

one to the virus through intercourse, covered in

yet another bill) is creating an inexcusable
hazard. However, while the idea behind these
bills is correct, we feel that existing reckless
endangerment laws are adequate to cover these
circumstances. I '

Caution is a commendable stance when deal-
ing with a dangerous disease, and the ACLU
should recognize that. But panic and paranoia
are not acceptable reactions to any problems.
We hope that the state legislature will act to
reduce the medical hazards of AIDS, without

creating an atmosphere of fear in which our
-individual freedoms can be violated.

Welcome to the University of Pittsburgh!

In the course of the coming year, you, as a
new Pitt student, will be subjected to many
enforced pleasures, like standing in lines in
various university _buildings with your 15,000
fellow undergraduates (not to mention 5,500
graduate and 1,600 professional school com-

rades) and all sorts of interesting fees and

surcharges which will distribute your wealth; ;

to causes which you may be less than enthu— ‘
siastic about. t

The first fee that will grab your attention as
you contemplate your pastel-blue computer
statement will be the Student Activities Fee.
This is a mandatory charge so you can have
fun. The Student Government Board decides
how this money is spent. I

If you follow in the tradition of your prede-

I cessors, now upperclassmen, you will proba-
. bly ignore the student government elections.

This is a mistake. These people will be
spending the $400,000 that your activities, fees

will add up to this year. Previous SGBs have
spent this money on things such as a $12,000 _‘ I

park bench (which you can see at the corner
of Fifth and Bigelow). If you care about how
your money is being spent, pay more atten-
tion to the elections. We didn’t, and we were
sorry. * ,

The second fee you will note on the state-

_ _ment is a mandatory computer fee of $55. This
will be raised to $1 10 per semester by the time ,

you graduate. For an extensive discussion of

this fee, see page B-2 in this section of the I

paper.

Housing is always a popular mandatory cost

for freshmen, along with the mandatory meal
plan. Since you must buy a meal plan, we
suggest you use it to eat. Otherwise, the food

will fatten up the roaches, who are sharing’

your dorm rooms. — p -
Now we come to the final charge — tuition.
One would think that the money we pay, and

the money that the university obtains fromf

other sources, is being used_ to pay for our
education. And most of it is. But the 1990
operating budget for Pitt allocates 22 percent

to research, while 35 percent goes to instruc-

tion. The research budget is more than half
the amount of the instruction budget. *
Research is an admittedly important facet of
university life. But as students, we are here to
learn. In the last year, there have been dis-

putes between the university and the faculty

over instructors’ salaries and union represen-
tation. Jerome. Martin, previous dean of the
School of “Health Related Professions, was
asked to resign, and a statement was issued
saying, “Martin has done a good job of moving
the school forward in -many areas, but an

‘academic researcher should take his place.”

We feel that a re-evaluation of the univer-
sity’s mission is necessary. Research is the
acquisition of knowledge; instruction is the
dissemination of _ that knowledge. When

“important knowledge is discovered through
research, there must be a solid base to trans- .

mit that knowledge. As students, we want the
university to devote more funds to teachers’
salaries. By paying a competitive rate, we can
attract the best possible instructors, and en-
hance the university as a place for learning.

I

B-,-2?

 

Should the university charge a ‘computer fee‘?

    

The Campus of the Future. It's

so important to the University of «

Pittsburgh that it's capitalized. It
might even be copyrighted.

But what is the Campus of the
Future? The administration is
supposedly surging toward
“phase three” of the project. What
happened to phases one and

_ two? Why isn't Pitt being featured

in every_ computer, trade and
collegiate magazine in the coun-
try if this is such a monumental
undertaking? I

Maybe because it has been a
failure so far. The university finds
itself $26 million in debt, and for
what? The PITTCAT system in
Hillman Library? A few extra
computer terminals in _ Forbes

V Quad, perhaps?

This third phase will appar-
ently include 200 new computer
terminals on campus, the NOTIS
library information system, which

will allow students to access Pitt’s ,
. library catalog from any terminal

and the Integrated Student Infor-
mation System (ISIS) which will
contain the - educational files of
all students from acceptance to

graduation.

ISIS will allow advisers to de-
termine whether a class is opened

S or closed during registration ses-
‘ sions so that students will no»
longer be disappointed when they

arrive at Thackeray ‘Hall and dis-
cover that their choice courses
are closed.

This process is scheduled to

' begin by the summer of 1990,

excluding 1989-90 seniors from
participation. Why then will the
university take their money for
this project?Just as in the registra-
tion process, the line must form

I somewhere.

At any rate, the university now
needs a sizeable sum of money if

it hopes to continue its project.
Where does an institution of
higher learning turn for money?
To the alumni? Nope. Grants? Not
this time.

No, the students of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh will bear the
brunt of this economic catastro-
phe, thanks to the institution of a

    

a

$55 “computer fee," which will
be tacked onto each and every
full-time student’s tuition bill each
semester. That extra charge will
escalate to $110’ per full-time
student in 1990.

The,Debt Service, as it is re-
ferred to on Pitt’s 1990 fiscal
budget, will generate $3.4 mil-
lion in funds.

Funny how this plan coincides
with the 1990 ﬁscal year budget,
in which Gov. Robert Casey
promised monetary returns to
each state school that keeps its
tuition increase under 4 percent
For Pitt that translates to $147 for
in-state students. Ironically, tui-

‘ tion increased by $140 (3.8%) for
' in-state students, the lowest tui-

tion increase in a decade.
Ah, but that computer fee. Pitt

.executive vice president Jack

Freeman told Tbe“Pz'tt News in
June that the fee was not a tuition
increase in disguise. The univer-
sity will, however, view the fee as
tuition for ﬁnancial aid matters.
You can’t have it both ways,
fellows. Tagging that $55 onto
our tuition would drop Pitt from
consideration for the governor's
Challenge Grant, which amounts
to $2.1 million for.Pitt this year.
Eliminating the fee puts Pitt back
into its financial hole. .
But should the students be
made responsible for this? One

I would think that a certain amount

of foresight is necessary when
embarking on a project seem-
ingly as prestigious and
groundbreaking as the Cam-
pus of the Future. With a debt
of $26 million, it is obvious
that that foresight was lack-
ing. Moreover, a university
that annually receives millions
of dollars in grants to its busi-
ness, law and medical schools
but cannot arrange a suitable
grant for a project which it

    
 
 
  

considers vital to the school’s
advancement is not an organ-
ized — or concerned —— institu-
tion.

Luckily, the students are here
to make up for the school’s
shortcomings. “Paying interest
on borrowed money is a waste,
and would come out-of student
money anyway, so the fee is the
best way. This is going to be an
ongoing project forever‘, ” Free-
man added to the good news.
Forever is a long time. But as
long as there are students to

foot the bill and money to be .

made in the process, why not?
After all, the students at Pitt are
apathetic. They certainly won’t
raise a fuss.

Will. they?

THE PHT NEWS, Monday, August 29, 1933

The University of Pittsburgh
has added a computer fee to its
tuition charges, starting this
semester, to the tune of $55 per
full-time student per semester.
The fee will double next year.

While the instinctive reaction
to an increase in our tuition is for
us to start screaming bloody
murder and complain about the
money being taken out of our
pockets, 1 think that it might be
worthwhile to think about what
this money is doing for us.

The budget of the university is
a funny thing. Generally, all funds
that go into the budget from
tuition must be split among the
departments in
predetermined
proportions. By
creating a computer fee that is
not, strictly speaking, considered
tuition by the budget, the univer-
sity can generate funds that will

I I
\

' be used only for the Campus of

the Future project. The project is
designed to improve operations
and efficiency at Pitt through the
use of computers. . .

The beneﬁts that we gainfrom _

the project are not dramatic or
earth-shattering. The improve-
ments are not likely to be her-
alded on the cover of every
computer magazine from coast
to coast. But they do make our
lives a bit simpler, a bit easier.
PITTCAT was one of the‘ first
systems to go into use. The
computerized card catalog has
been installed in Hillman Library,
and some of the other branch
and specialized libraries of the

‘university. Using PITTCAT, one

can search for titles in speciﬁc

‘subject areas with the press of a
button, and print out the infor-
jmation on the books selected.

Researching a paper could in»-
volve hours with a card catalog
alone, simply finding and copy-
ing numbers from cards. With

‘PITTCAT, it takes five minutes,
| and also gives you the location of

the book and tells you if it has
been checked out. Not a bad
convenience.

Thackeray Hall has also been
adapted for the Campus of the
Future. If you thought that you
had to wait for a long time to
register for ypur classes, you
should have been here last year.
It easily took twice’ as long. In

 

I

addition, there is now an infor-
mation kiosk in the ground floor
lobby and the registration office
has a terminal that has informa-
tion on open and closed classes.

There are computer labs in
many buildings, with Macin-
toshes, IBMs and mainframe ter-
minals. The labs provide a vari-
ety of word-processing, graphics

These are just some of 

benefits that the Campus of the
Future program has broughtto
Pitt. The computer fee will help
pay for that, without depriving
the school of the aid promised‘
under Gov. Richard Casey's plan.
While some might criticize this
action as duplicity, a hidden tui-
tion hike, the fact remains that by
calling this a computer fee, the
university guarantees that it will
be spent on computer projects

and let us keep a couple of _

million dollars in state aid. I can
forgive a white lie if it helps the
school by securing a grant that

Pitt.

One last point —- projections
for future uses of the computer»
fee include a plan to put termi-'
nals in the advising offices for the
various departments. This will

eventually phase out the registra-

tion lines at Thackeray Hall alto-
gether. I, for one, will gladly pay
the extra few bucks simply for
the knowledge that I may never

have to enter Thackeray Hall ever

again...

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, T988

just another example of

What can be said for numbers
and ﬁgures in American politics?
Well, Gallup polls have proven
their accuracy by consistently
predicting the outcome of presi-
dential races within a few tenths
of a percent. However, in their
quest for answers, many polls
have revealed the political igno-
rance of the collective American
psyche. The ﬁndings have been
disturbing.

A late-July poll taken in 1988
by the Gallup Organization found
that half of the American people
couldn’t identify Nicaragua as “the
country where Sandinistas op-
pose Contras.” Nlany of these
geniuses thought that the two
groups were ﬁghting in Iran,

. Lebanon, or Afghanistan.

This leads to a puzzling ques-

‘tion that has also been the subject

of many polls: How can the
American public make a credible
judgment (and everyone has tried)
on whether or not Lt. Col. Oliver
North should go to jail for the

Wils0n’s First

Help! It's that time. Of course
I’m referring to the perfect op-
portunity to lug all of your worldly
possessions into rooms that are
smaller than a hamster cage, to

finally find the time to count each’

and every hair on your arm while
waiting in any number of lines.
You've guessed it — it’s “The

some time by supplying a few
useful deﬁnitions, (Please resist
the overwhelming urge to study
and memorize them.)

College: An institution of
higher learning where girls go to
become more rounded [ask them
who has the quickest pizza deliv-
ery] and boys go to learn the ﬁne

Loc/eea' into the college trac/es Does the investment pay?

Is college an investment? Stu-
dents bank on the promise of a
better job after graduation. A year-
old American Council on Educa-
tion survey found that in 1988, 72
percent of more than 300,000
freshmen entered college to make
more money.

 

The serious investor would
never buy stock in a corporation
without ﬁrst investigating several

V crucial details. First, the investor

needs to -1 know what that com-
pany produces. If the company
were new, he would want to
know the management’s strategy
for penetrating the market. If the
company were established, he
would want to know the man-
agement’s strategy for securing

or increasing its market share in .

the face of competition.

e 0 But for the serious investor, the

diversion of funds from Iranian
arms sales to the Nicaraguan
rebels, when they don’t even
know where the Nicaraguan
rebels are fighting? After all, our
principal reason for involvement
in this affair was preventing the

spread of communism in our ‘

backyard, Central America.

Then again, this is a little less
revolting when one considers that
75 percent of these same geo-
graphic illiterates couldn’t cor-
rectly locate the Persian Gulf.

Perhaps this is what we inad-
vertently but indicatively learn
from many political polls: Most of
the people polled have no idea
what they’re talking about. A few
more examples:

That same Gallup poll found
that one-third of Americans ques-
tioned could name four of the 16
NATO-member countries, while
another third couldn’t name any
of them, and 16 percent said the
Soviet Union belonged. Even
more staggering were the 50

art of regurgitation.

T.A.: Short for teaching assis-
tant. These are people who teach
foreign languages, no matter what
subject they claim to be teaching.

Recitation: Meeting between
a T.A. and a group of students
that is shrouded in mystery. No

 

one seems to know what goes on
after the "ﬁrst meeting, because
no one attends after that.
OrganicChemistry:Anexperi-
ence similar to being tied to a
burning stake while a group of
blindfolded people throw knives
at you, only worse. ‘ .
Access Code: A seven-digit
number that acts as a money-

important aspect would be the
stock’s yield. How would this
initial investment translate into
future proﬁts?

Do college students see a re-
turn on their investment? The
above-mentioned survey reported
a. marked increase in the inci-
dence of depression, suicide, and
other stress-related ailments
among college students. As re-
ported in The Washington Post
Kenneth Green, associate direc-
tor of the survey, attributes this
increase in stress levels to anxiety
over future ﬁnancial prospects.

“The hallmark of rniddle-class
[families’] expectations is that their
children will have a better life.
For many students, that sense of
opportunity is drawn into ques-
tion," he said.

A new federal study has dis-
covered a more alarming trend.

The Wall Street journal re ported
that a study of 25,000 high school
graduates found that after four
years, the percentage of the class
of 1982 who had achieved col-

percent who failed to name any
members of the Warsaw Pact
(Hint: you know, Warsaw, as in
Warsaw, Poland?), with only 20
percent correctly naming four
members, and more than one in
10 granting the U.S. membership.
A Washington Post poll from late
April of this year found that only
37 percent of the people who

 

were asked whether or not
Speaker of the House Jim Wright
was guilty of the charges brought
against him could correctly iden-
tify him as a Democrat. This is
disturbing because the speaker is
always a member of the majority
party in the House: which has
been Democratic since 1955. But
this finding is more troubling for
the Republican Party, which had
been rejoicing over the self-de-

sary to make a phone call off-

Frat Party: A place for girls to
obtain free beer, meet young
men with hormone problems and
lose all modesty while using the
co-ed facilities.

Fire Drill: Social meetings,
usually for residents of Lothrop

and considerate person who pulls
the alarm every few days. .

Purse: A small pouch that is

» attached in some way to the

shoulders/ arms of freshman girls.
As the year progresses, the girls
seem to undergo some sort of
molting period during which they
shed their purses. It might have
something to do with puberty.
The O: A place to obtain late
night delicacies such as fried

lege diplomas was less than half
that of the class of '72. ,.

Of the classsof 1982, only 7
percent acquired their bachelor's
degree four years after gradu-
ation. Seven yearsafter gradu-
ation, that number swelled to 19
percent. But of the 1972 seniors
studied, 15 percent received their
degree four years after gradu-
ation, and one quarter had com-
pleted college seven years later.

This decline in college com-
pletion rates coincides with what
Henry Levin, director of the Center
for Educational Research at Stan-
ford University, calls an “inexo-
rable rise in the qualiﬁcations
being demanded [of] job appli-
cants.”

And of those who have com-
pletedcollege, the time spent
earning a baccalaureate has in-
creased from 4.5 years in 1972 to
over ﬁve years today.

Is that time well spent? College
costs have outpaced inﬂation
nearly every year this decade.

struction of top Democrats like

to be happy about if the voters

mid-January of this year further

illustrated the political ineptitude.

of the American public with the
stunning revelation that 78 per-
cent of the participants_.couldn’t
identify a member of the Bush
cabinet, while only 10 percent
could identify Secretary of State
James Baker, and only 3 percent
correctly identified Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh (who
held the same position in the
Reagan cabinet). Now this is
somewhat excusable since Bush
wasn’t yet inaugurated; however,
44 percent of these same res pon-
dents still considered themselves
enough of an authority on the

“good-to—excellent,” and 39 per-

cent said that the picks were

be achieved by a failure to ex-

Optimistically, the Committee
for Economic Development, an
organization of educational and
corporate leaders, estimated that

emoney spent for education pays

a return to students of about 7 to
11 percent after inflation. A North-
western University study of ca-
reer opportunities predicted that
the starting salary for a college
graduate would average $27,000
this year.

The earning power of a college
graduate has increased faster than
inﬂation since 1973, however.
Today, it is about $6,000 more (in
1989 dollars) than in the early
’70s.

But for the more than 20 mil-
lion high school graduates who
choose not to attend college, the
future is bleak. The earning power
of high school graduates who do
not attend college or technical
school has dropped 28 percent
since 1973. Well-paying manu-
facturing jobs have disappeared

the ignorance of the masses

And ﬁnally, from an April
Boston Globe/WBZ poll comes
the most telling statistic. Massa-

chusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, .

who was popular enough to
receive 46 percent of the coun-
try’s vote for the U.S. presidency
only 9 months ago, registered an
all—time low approval rating of
19 percent in his own state. Well,

maybe not all polls reflect politi- ‘

cal ignorance. 
Ultimately, though, we do need
polls for their ability to portray
the views (and votes) of the
American people. If conducted
responsibly, they have a place in
politics — assuming, of course,
that the respondents’ intelligence

level is above that of a house- '9
plant. But they are useful, fre--

quently probing beyond the
‘superficial with good accuracy
— so accurate that they not only

present the facts, but ironically, '

the follies. '

A third political party for, Women isn't going to help anyone 

According to Molly Yard, presi-
dent of the National Organiza-
tion for Women, the July 3 Su-
preme Court decision allowing
states to restrict abortion is “war
against women.” She is angry
and vows to'ﬁght.

However, Ms. Yard wants to
fight for women’s rights by form-
ing a political party for women.

On the surface, this doesn’t
sound so bad. Even in these post-
feminist times, there is still plenty
for women to fight for. The Equal
Rights Amendment, child-care
programs and especially the right

to choose are important con-

cerns. And the vast majority of
congressmen are male. One can
definitely see Ms. _Yard’s motiva-
tion. ‘

As good as this idea may sound
on paper, however, I can hardly
think of a dumber idea. I

Likeit or not, the United States
has a two-party system. Most
alternative parties have failed
miserably. For years,‘ the Liber-
tarians have been calling them-
selves the party of the future. The
wackos in various leftist parties
are still trying to warn Giant Eagle
shoppers of the evils of capital-
ism. . V '

Noted bigot George Wallace

brought him five states and 46

for a third party but still far be-
hind Richard Nixon and Hubert
Humphrey.

Compared to most other na—.

tions, the U.S. political spectrum
is quite narrow. Some may ﬁnd it
amusing that President Bush
could be viewed as a decadent
liberal in the_more reactionary
corners of the globe. While some
of these nations are totalitarian
dictatorships, others have many
political parties, in orderto rep-
resent the wider spectrum, espe-
cially in Western Europe.
However, it just ain’t that way
in the good ol’ U.S. of A. It
doesn't look like it’s going to
change in the near future, either.

pThe sad truth is the American

people generally view parties
other than the two main ones as
radical. And often enough, they’re
right. I

So instead of putting their ef-
forts into electing candidates that

eotluer permitting

NOW’s energy (and money) into
starting a third party. What a
waste.

The fact is, with abortion lit-
mus tests being conducted for
everyone running for any office,
abortion is no longer a party
issue. It is an individual candi-
date issue. For example, it

 

wouldn’t be surprising to see a
pro-choice Republican (there are
some out there) take on Pennsyl-
vania’s pro-life Gov. Casey (a
Democrat) in next year’s guber-
natorial election. Tbis is where
NOW should be directing its
energy.

Of course, some say that NOW’s
new party could cause both the
Democratic and Republican par-

ties to move to the left. I doubt it.»

At best, the new party would be
placed in the same nutball cate-

gory as LaRouche, the Libertari-

ans, etc. At worst, however, his-
tory could repeat itself indefi-
nitely. '

Wilson took on incumbent Wil-

exp. 9/1]

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, i988

presidents of that era, former
president Theodore Roosevelt
decided to step in. .

Instead of challenging Taft

through the Republican party and
then tackling Wilson, Roosevelt
decided to try a different method.
He ran on the ticket of the Pro-
gressive Party, nicknamed the
Bull Moose party.
, What he achieved was a split of
the Republican votes. With nei-
ther Roosevelt nor Taft ‘able to
capture a vast majority of Repub-
lican votes, Wilson made out like
an electoral bandit with a solid
victory.

I fear that a similar split could
affect the Democratic party if the
women’s party were to take off.
There is a conservative wing of

the Democrats that Yard and

Company don’t like to acknowl-
edge. Many traditional liberals,
especially men —- while we’re
eliminating stereotypes, there are
also a lot of pro-choice men -—
would stay with the Democrats.
However, with the women’s party
being viewed as radically liberal,
more fuel would be given to the
conservative wing of the Demo-
cratic party (which has long been
trying to rid itself of the “liberal”
label). ,

We could regress to the period
of the 1940s and '50s, when
anyone vaguely liberal was con-

sidered out of the mainstream, or-

even a communist subversive.
Remember, before the 19605, the

. only political party which took a

stand against segregation was the
Communist Party. Everyone else
was afraid of the political impli-
cations of taking a stand for blacks.

And as long as we're mention-
ing segregation, wouldn’t a
women’s partybe just that? Funny,
I always thought segregation was
the opposite of equality.

It is obvious that the best plan
for the pro-choice is to flee from
party affiliation, and back pro-
choice candidates — both the
Democrats and Republicans. With
a “women’s party,” the only ones
who will gain anything are the

conservatives. The rest of us lose

— especially women.

Tales from  the Hive: a story of sheer horror (for mature readers)

I know that insects hate me.
Recently, I went camping (in the
rain), and all I have to show for it
is 20 or 30 assorted spider, mos-
quito and other unidentiﬁed bug
bites. My camping partner is
unscathed. I am reminded of the
incident that must have started it
all, the reason that the insect
kingdom has it in for me...

One afternoon, when I was a
wee lass of 7 or 8, while I was
visitinga friend, we happened
upon a wonderful thing — a
beehive without any bees in it.
My friend’s father had extermi-
natedall the adult bees, but we
soon discovered that there were
bee larvae inside the little wax-
covered cells, and the larvae were
alive. It was interesting to pierce
the wax and find the little grubs
beneath, so white and soft and
naked-looking. —

Children are sadists at heart,

The 1988-89 school year:

Oh what a difference a year
makes. ' '

This time last year, Michael
Dukakis and George Bush were
neck-and-neck in the presiden-

Wright were still in power and
Dan Quayle was being laughed
at.

After 565 days, the Duke can-

not even keep Massachusetts

solvent, Bush is as boring as
president as he was as veep,
Reagan and Wright have walked
into alternate sunsets and Quayle
is still being laughed at.

The national election cast a
weird glow on the Pitt campus.
Suddenly, from both the political
left and right, the College Young
Democrats and College .Young
Republicans crept out from un-
der rocks, boulders and poli sci
classes. Before you could say

{3} “futility,” both organizations had

set up voter registration booths
and ﬁred rhetorical shots across
each other’s bows. I should know
—I helped pilot the booth on the

_ right a couple of times.

But when all was said and
done, Bush won the election
anyway, and the College Young
Politicians disappeared, never to
be seen again that year.

For a while, the campus qui-
eted down. That was until Pitt’s
Student Government Board suf-
fered itsgown version of the Iran-
Contra Scandal. It seems our il-
lustrious student government
president didn’t knowthat a cache
of money, called the Student
Reserve Fund, provided by you,
the student (via Student Activities
Fees), existed. The president,
whose tenure lasts until this
December, tried to fend off
charges by blasting everything in

c hisvway, including The _Pitt News

for having the audacity to print
the news. I would say that a crisis
of confidence existed, but since
no conﬁdence existed in the first
place...

After that, the fun didn't stop
rolling in. On an enjoyable April

dlight, the Pittsburgh Liquor

and this little game took a really
sick turn soon after we noticed
some matches and funny looking
sticks lying on the picnic table.
near us.

“What are those things?” I asked

 

my friend.

“These are punks,” she told
me. “We light them when we eat
out here because they keep bugs
away. They burn for a really long
time.”

We were at the pyromaniac
stage of our childhood, so we just
had to light one of those punks,
even though we weren’t sup-
posed to play with matches. My

. friend did it since she played with

matches regularly and could light

pected. However, the football

we pretended that the punk was
a cigarette in an elegant holder,
and we laughed at each other as
we admired the effect of the
slow, spiraling smoke. Next she
suggested we steal one of her
parents’ real cigarettes and try
smoking it, but it seemed too
dangerous because we thought
they might smell it on us. Then
we made a little twig fire for a

.while, but it really wasn’t very

spectacular, and the punk itself
had lost a lot of its initial excite-
ment. , .
One of us, or perhaps both us,
ﬁnally noticed the bees’ nest lying
forgotten on the ground, and for
some reason, it suddenly seemed
necessary to kill those helpless
baby bees so that not a one could
grow up into a big, dangerous,
stinging bee. So we methodically

Wotta year!
But more témpestuous than
the various Pitt sports teams was

the ubiquitous abortion debate
that eventually found its way onto \

_ the pages of The Pitt News. From

the front page to the Perspective
section, it was even on the sports
pages, when pro-lifers and pro-
choicers had their ﬁrst annual ice
hockey game. No puck was used,
the two teams just skated toward
each other and jousted with their
-hockey sticks. -
And ﬁnally, Pitt raised its tui-

up to talk about something trite
and the rantings of some far-right

Rumor has it that he and the SGB

until we grew tired of it.
After dinner, I su ggested a game

of tag, because my friend had a,

wonderful, big yard on all sides
of her house. It was her turn to
chase me, so I went running
through the yard toward the front
of the house, where I knew I

, could hidein some bushes. I

turned the corner and there they
were — bees, seemingly lying in
wait for me! I dithered a bit, but
the bees knew their target, and
when they attacked, I took off in
the opposite direction as fast as I
could run. There were bees of all
kinds —— yellow jackets, hornets,
tiny sweat bees —— and they
buzzed angrily in pursuit. I heard
my friend yelling, “What's wrong?

‘ What are you doing? Wow, there

are bees all over you; go inside!”

So I headed in that direction.
Inside the house, I found that a

hornet had stung me on my cheek;

three yellow jackets had gotten .

me on my arms and legs; and

seven sweat bees were trapped —

under my shirt, buzzing furiously
and biting me repeatedly. My
friend’s mother kept saying, “It’s
all right, you can cry honey, really.
Go ahead]? as she swabbed my

many wounds, but I was too. .

stunned (and perhaps too poi-
soned by bee bites) to react;
When I think back, I realize
that my friend wasn’t bitten at all,
and I swear it was all her idea in

the first place. Strangely enough, .

I haven’t been visited by any
bees since then, although I have
a healthy fear of them nonethe-
less. But every time I go outside,
other insects like mosquitos and
spiders have a field day. Hope.-
fully now that I’ve publicly con-
fessed this heinous childhood
crime, the bees will ask the rest of
the insects to leave me alone...

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 29, 1988‘

*®g~>.5:g.ss2'2a3°

A concerned upperclassman offers some advice

From beggars and street
preachers to highly intelligent
and well informed CAS advisers,
everybody has advice for
incoming freshmen. Now what

you need to do is sort all this
information and decide what
advice is best for yourself.

As a senior, I have benevolently
chosen to take the responsibility
of sifting through these reams of
advice, leaving the bad
information to sink to the bottom
and letting the good stuff rise into
the pages of The Pitt News.

0 Most of you have already
registered for your classes.
Hopefully, your schedule causes
you as little stress as possible.
However, it’s inevitable thatsome
of you are registered for an 8 a.m.
class. Take advantage of one of
the few useful options the registrar

 has to offer —— drop this class

immediately. I don’t care if you’re
sitting in a bathroom stall in the
Student Union, get off your butt
and head up to Thackeray Hall.
Eight o'clock classes are not meant

 

to be taken. I understand that the
temptation is there. You think it’s
the only class that doesn’t interfere
with General Hospital, or it’s a
really interesting subject, or it’s
only three days a week. This kind
of reasoning is not rational when
it is 7:45 a.m. and you are trudging
from your cozy Towers room
over to the Cathedral of Learning
in mid—November. There is no
known subject that could possibly
be interesting to a college student
this early in the morning. Not
Experimental Drugs 101 nor even
a Sexual Practices lab could be
worth the cold gloomy morning
that follows a rough Thursday
night.

0 The most important resource
for survival in American culture is
money. Obviously you don’t have
any, and a job is out of the
question. Now think, who do
you know that has money to
support your needs? The answer
is — your parents. But how can
you convince them to part with
it? The first thing you need to
know is that your parents love
you (that’s why they sent you to
Pitt), and it is extremely painful
for them to see you suffer. The
second thing to remember is to
be creative. Don’t call up Mom

and Dad with the same sob story
each week; they’ll catch on after
a few weeks and figure out why
you are calling within a few
seconds of the conversation’s
start. A third important rule is
always be as obscure as possible
about the fact that you are asking
for money. If you are a successful
beggar you can actually get Mom
and Dad to the point where they
ask you if you need some extra
money. Here is an example of a
proper pitch:

You: Hi Mom, how's everything
at home? Bobby -told me that you
and Dad had a really good time at
the Anderson's surprise party.

Mom: Everything’s fine here.
You should have seen the look
on Mrs. A’s face when the dancing
gorilla showed up. So, how is my
little college boy?

You: Please stop calling me
that. Things are really busy here.
You know how most people gain
weight when they go to college?
Well I'm doing the opposite, I'm.
losing it.

Mom: Are you eating enough?’

You: I guess so. It’s just thatt
this cafeteria food is so disgusting. .

It’s hard eating ground meat eight
meals in a row.

Mom: Roger, you can’t let
yourself waste away down to
nothing; you have to eat. Why
don’t you order a pizza every
once in a while to break the
monotony?

You: I’d like to, but they're so
expensive and I need my money
for a frater——— ahem, I mean I keep
having to buy more books and
stuff.

At this point, you can either ask
for the money straight out or you
can pursue the pathetic bit until
Mom is on her knees asking to
put money in your account. I

prefer the latter option.

Well, that’s about all the advice
I would like to part with at this
time. My benevolence has expired
as quickly as the parking meter in
front of my car, and I must be off
to carry on the upperclassman

life I live. But please take this

advice to heart. I guarantee that it
will be more useful than what the
beggar has to offer.

Caliguire continues tradition of exceptional Pitt linemen

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Over the past few years, the
University of Pittsburgh football
team has turned out some of the
best offensive linemen in the
country. There are currently 11
former Pitt linemen playing in
the NFL. Jimbo Covert, Randy
Dixon, Russ Grimm, Mark May
and Jim Sweeney (to name a few)
are all enjoying successful pro-
fessional careers. Bill Fralic,
considered by some to be the
best offensive lineman ever, is, of
course, from Pitt. Just this year,
two more Panther linemen were
taken early in the NFL draft. Tom
Ricketts was a first-round choice,
and Mark Stepnoski was the first
selection in the third round.

Pitt will have another outstand-
ing offensive line this year, con-
tinuing the tradition built by the
aforementioned linemen. Seniors
Roman Matusz and Chris Goetz
will make the left side of the line
almost impenetrable. The right
side will feature young, upcom-
ing talent in Mike LiVorio and
Tony Delazio.

But the man in the middle is
perhaps the best known of the
group. That man is Dean
Caliguire. I

Caliguire, Pitt’s 6—foo’t-3, 275-
pound center, is rated a presea-
son ﬂrst—team All-American by
no less than three publications,

' , including Football Digest. He-has

a host of other preseason honors,
including a rating as the eighth-
best center in the nation by The
Sporting News. '

Although Stepnoski and Rick-
etts got‘ most of the attention last
season, Caliguire was named
second-team All-East and honor-

, able mention All-American by

L,‘

The Associated Press. In 1987,
before switching from guard to
center, he was named All-East
guard. I

At Montour High School he
was anAP and United Press Inter-
national All-State. His high school
jersey number, 76, was retired by
Montour. Caliguire was offered

. scholarships by numerous foot-

ball colleges, including Notre
Dame, Penn State, Nebraska,
UCLA and Miami.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
describes Caliguire as “a perfec-
tionist with a sense of humor.”

Pitt offensive line coach Bill

if Meyers feels that Caliguire is as

good a center as he has ever
coached, but Caliguire knows
when it’s time to have fun.

The following is an interview
with Caliguire:

Q: You've been a good line-
man at Pitt for three years al-
ready, but you have been playing
in the shadows of Stepnoski and
Ricleetts. Now that they’re gone,
do you feel that this is you ryearto
get the attention and to shine?

A: As it looks right now, Roman
Matusz, Chris Goetz and myself
are seniors, and I guess we’re the
top linemen coming in. Mentally,
it doesn’t feel any different as far
as camp [goes]. I just go out and

try to play as hard as I can. I never
really thought I was in the shad-
ows of anybody; we always just
played together. Mark and Tom
had their time, now we’re getting
our time. It's not one person
overshadowing the next, it’s five
guys playing collectively on the
line who contribute to the whole
offense, and that’s what is impor-
tant. I

Q: You’ve already been All-
East, and now you ’re an All-
American candidate; do you feel
any added pressure trying to
achieve these honors?

A: As far as that stuff goes, like
I said, I’m going to try to go out
and play the best I can and do the
best that I can do, and if that’s
good enough to make All—Ameri-
can, well, that’s great. If that is
good enough to get me drafted,
that’s great. But my main concern

is to win the East and to win the

National Championship, and I’m

\ going to do my part for the team

and all the individual things [will]

come.

Q: Where do you fit in with all
the former Pitt greats like Fralic
and May and the others?

A: Well, I feel pretty ﬂattered to
even be in the same sentence and
be mentioned with Bill Fralic and
Mark May, Emil Boures, Jim
Sweeney, Mark and Tom. I feel
good to even be [compared] to
those guys. I couldn’t say which

one of those guys [was] the best. A

Right now, I’d say Fralic would
be the best. Where I would fit in
 down the line, I have no idea;
I just feel good to be mentioned
with those guys.

Q: You came in as a guard and
were switched to center. Now that
you've had experience at both of
the positions, which one would
you say you like better?

A: I liked the fact that when I
played guard I could run and pull
and trap and cut and things like
that. It took awhile for me to get
used to center, butl enjoy having

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 28, I989

By Chris Kuzneski
For The Pitt News

For a football program to be
successful, there are two essen-
tial elements that must blend
together effectively.

The most obvious element is

‘ an abundance of talented play-

ers. Without gifted athletes, no
team can be successful.

The second essential ingredi-‘
ent to a football team is good

coaching. Without the aid of good
coaches, talented players are

wasted. In order to upgrade the

Pitt football coaching staff, head
coach Mike Gottfried has brought
in four new assistants for the
1989 football season.

Bob Valesente, named assis-
tant head coach and defensive
coordinator last spring, will fill
the void left by John Fox, who
took the defensive back position
with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Valesente, who begins his 25th
season coaching football, was an
assistant to Gottfried when he
coached at the University of
Kansas. Because of this, Valesente
knows what to expect.

“I'm new tothe University of
Pittsburgh, but I’m not new to
Coach Gottfried’s staff. We
worked together at Kansas, and
the 4-3 defense was in the picture
then. He has carried that through
to here at the University of Pitts-
burgh, and the 4-31 defense has
been established.”

In order to be successful using
a 4-3 defense, however, many
talented linemen are needed.‘
Valesente feels that type of talent
has been stockpiled at Pitt.

“The strength of the defense
will be the front four. We have

depth there and people coming
back with experience. I know
they'll be physical and dominate
the game.”

Over the course of his distin-
guished coaching career,
Valesente has coached at Cor-
nell, Cincinnati, Arizona, Missis-
sippi State, and Maryland. He
also briefly coached in the NFL as
the Baltimore Colts’ secondary
coach during the 1982 and 1983
seasons.

While coaching at Baltimore,
Valesente was frequently con-
fronted by a young assistant coach

. Gottfried welcomes four new coaches to his stozﬁ” .

from Temple University who
always had questions about de-
fensive strategy.

The young assistant’s name was
Nick Rapone, and after a six—year
stint at Temple, Gottfried asked
Rapone to coach alongside
Valesente, his former mentor.

“When I was at Temple, as
always, I tried to improve,” said
Rapone. “At that point, Coach
Valesente was regarded as one of
the best secondary coaches in
the country. What I wanted to do
was pick his brain, so I'd get in

Richards, Walker
to provide savory
ground game

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

“What if?” V ,
Those two words could ring in
Adam Walker’s mind like a 6 a.m.

wake—up call. The Pitt Panther I

tailback rushed for 327 yards and
five touchdowns in the first two
games of 1988, freeing himself
from the shadow of one Craig
Heyward, who gained 1,791 yards
and scored 12 touchdowns in
1987.

It was a major coup for the
Panthers, as critics and fans alike
feared that the ground game that
Heyward established would be
lost-with his early departure to
the NFL. For two games, Walker
alleviated those fears, leading Pitt
to 59-10 and 42-10 wallopings of
Northern Iowa and Ohio State,
respectively.

After rushing for only 39 yards

in a 31-10 loss to West Virginia at ‘

Pitt Stadium, Walker may have
been ready to tear up a Boston

‘College defense that allowed

freshman Curvin Richards — 202
yards on the ground, but Walker

Nair

I?

finished the season with 406 yards
rushing and six touchdowns, but
never regained his opening—sea-
son form.

Walker, now a healthy, 6-foot-
3, 200—pound senior, doesn’t like

‘to hear “What if?” even though he

was on target for a 1,900—yard
season. He’d just as soon con-
centrate on 1989 and the poten-
tial he brieﬂy ﬂashed in 1988.

“I don’t have to prove any-

thing. Everyone knows my tal- .

ent, and I’m just back and I’m
healthy, and whenever I’m called
upon I'm going to rise to the
occasion, ” Walker says. “I’m going
all-out this year, and anything I
can do to help the team will help
me. I’m going to set myself to
help the team win, and all of my
personal goals will follow in
place.”

There are a few folks Walker

will have to impress, namely his

coaches and Richards, who
gained 1,228 yards and scored
eight touchdowns in the Walker’s
absence.

The coaches, however, may
not be so anxious to name one or
the other as the absolute starter.
Head coach Mike Gottfried plans
to use a plethora of running backs
that include Walker, Richards,
Ricky Turner, Glenn Deveaux,
Danny Boyd, Jimmer Bundy and
others in a two-back offense.

“I really don’t know if we’re
going to be in the backﬁeld to-
gether or not,” says Walker, but
running backs coach Larry Kirksey
says that nothing is out of the
question.

“You look at personnel, and
you want to put your best players
on the field. Our offense is set up

right now as a two-back offense,”
Kirksey says. ,

“We’re both going to get to
play a lot, and I think that’s
good,” says Richards, a soft-spo-
ken, 5-5, 195-pound sophomore
from LaPorte, Texas, and origi-
nally from Trinidad. “But my No.
1 priority is for the team to be
successful and goto a bowl game. '
As an individual, I just want to get
better.” .

Richards doesn’t seem to have
far to go in that category. He was
named The Sporting News fresh-
man of the year in 1988, and
preseason honors are already
pouring in. One magazine rates
him as the No. 4 Heisman Trophy
candidate, for the best player in
the nation. Another calls him the
nation’s 10th—best halfback.

See R133, page C-26

Curvin Richards will join Adam Walker in the backfield, giving Pitt a potent running attack. 2

Sophomore linebackers building on their reputations

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

One wanted to be a cricket
player when he still lived in
Kingston, Jamaica. The other was
recruited by Yale University,
which allots only academic schol-
arships, even to athletes. Respec-
tively, they are Pitt’s Ricardo
McDonald and Curtis Bray, and
together, they form one of the
most formidable outside lineback-
ing pairs in the east.

As freshmen in 1988, both
McDonald and Bray made imme-
diate contributions to a team al-
ready considered young.
McDonald, a 6—foot—2, 200—poun—
der from Paterson, NJ‘, became
only the fifth player in the last
two decades to start the first
game of his freshman career,
joining Tony» Dorsett, Hugh
Green, Bill Fralic and Marc Spin-
dler.

Bray, a 6-4, 255—pound
Monroeville native, came off
Augustgknee surgery to play in 10
of 11 games, including the sea-
son opener against Northern
Iowa, just six days after his knee
was healed andhe began prac-
tice. «

They combined for 121 tack-
les, six quarterback sacks and
two interceptions for Pitt’s 6-5
team. With the graduation of

middle linebackerjerry Olsavsky, ,

who became the first Pitt player
since Arnie Weatherington (1973-
75) to record three consecutive
100 tackle seasons, the heat is on
the young linebacker tandem to
produce again this year

Bray, for one, is ready. “I ex-
pected to play last season, but I
knew for me to play, I’d have to
carry my weight. ’

“There’s no chance fora sopho-
more letdown,” he adds. “I feel
more confident this year. I think
I’ll make an improvement this

year [over] last year.”

With last year’s defensive line
nearly intact, sans end Burt Gross-
man, and a banner year of junior
college and freshman recruits, as
well as last year’s other returning
veterans, Bray believes the de-
fense as a whole will be nearly
impenetrable.

“I don’t think any team can just
ﬂat out run or pass against this
defense. I really can’t see them
doing that.

“I feel me and ‘Rico [McDonald]
can dominate games. I feel really

confident about the season."

Panther head coach Mike
Gottfried tabbed the linebacking
depth as one of the areas of
concern in spring practice, but
Bray doesn’t see it that way.

“We’re solid all over. We have
a lot of good linebackers. I think
it’s probably the deepest position
on the team. A lot of people can
play there,” he says.

The impression one gets from
Bray and McDonald is that they
are seasoned veterans, eager and

able to call the shots for the

defense. Linebacker coach Sal
Sunseri concurs.

“I think they do [have enough
experience to be leaders]. ‘Rico
played in 11 games, Curtis played
in 10. They had 20 practices in
spring ball, and they’re going to
have 29 practices here
Uohnstownl. They have a lot of
time now, plus they’re more in-
telligent than they were last year,
so I don’t see any problem,”
Sunseri says.

But both Bray and McDonald
agree that their game is not as

Pitt ’s tradition of excellence continues in the '80s

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

There's no doubt about it.
Throughout the years, Pitt has
traditionally been one of the best

college football schools in the
nation. As we enter the 100th
season of football at Pitt, the
university’s football tradition has
been built on nine national cham-

pionships and 543 wins.

Ezekial Gadson had 24.5 sacks in 1987, setting a new Pitt

record.

Pitt has produced some of the
greatest teams and players in the
history of college football. Tony
Dorsett and the rest of the 1976
Panther squad could be consid-
ered one of the best ever.

Even though that 1976 team
brought the last national champi-
onship to Pitt, the Panthers have
continued to be one of the pre-
mier teams in the nation. The Pitt
teams throughout the 1980s have

done more than their job to
uphold Pitt's rich football tradi-
tion.

That tradition is one of the
reasons head coach Mike
Gottfried came to Pitt.

“As I stood in the stadium, I
looked at all the numbers on the
wall. All the national champion-
ships  the great coaches  the
great players  the history. There’s
national prestige,” said Gottfried

when he first arrived at Pitt in
1986.

Alex Kramer, who has been
Pitt football’s‘ administrative as-
sistant since 1976, feels the play-
ers’ attitudes toward the tradition
here haven’t changed through
the years.

“One thing that has remained
consistent is that the kids we had
from the turn of the decade, from

the 705 into the ’80s, were kids
who sincerely wanted to be here.
They have all been good enough
that they could have played else-
where, they just wanted‘ to play
f5'rMPittl,i” said Kramer. “As the

decade draws to a close, we still V

have that type of kid. These kids ‘

are still ones who are happy to be ‘

here at Pitt.”

Dr. Ed Bozik, Pitt’s athletic Q

director, agrees that the 19805
were a successful period for Pitt
football.

g “The long-range trend of our
football program, in my view, is
headed in the right direction,”
said Bozik. “In the beginning of

‘ the decade, we had some teams

that were highly ranked and very
competitive. We took a little dip
for about three or four years, but
I see that trend coming back.”

The 1980s certainly were like a
Kennywood roller coaster as far
as winning goes.

1980: Pitt went into the season
as the No. 1-ranked team in the
nation. The seniors on the squad
were freshmen when Pitt got its
last national championship in
1976, and they had dreams of
getting another one. Defense was
the name of the game for the
Panthers and head coach Jackie
Sherrill. The defense was headed
by All-American linebacker Hugh
Green. Linebackers Rickyjackson
and Sal Sunseri were also part of
the dominating defense. Tailback
Randy McMillan and All-Ameri-
can tackle Mark May led the
offense along with second-year
quarterback Dan Marino.

However, in the fifth game of
the season Pitt faced off against a
tough Florida State team. Pitt lost
the game in Tallahassee 36-22,
and their hopes for a national
championship began to fade.

No other quarterback return-
ing for the Panthers played even
one down in a game situation. A
great deal of pressure will there-
fore be put on the individual who
gets the call to start at quarter-

The top candidate for the posi-
tion is Alex Van Pelt, who was
red-shirted last year as a fresh-

“I don't really feel any pres-
sure. It’s unfortunate that it hap-
pened [to Dickerson], but there’s
nothing anybody can do about it.
It’s in the past now, and you have
to look forward to what you have
to work with in the next four
years, and that’s what we’re
doing,” said Van Pelt.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
shares similar views about the
Dickerson circumstance.

“It’s frustrating. Had Darnell
been here, he could have turned
into the kind of quarterback who,

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, Augusf28, I989

two years from now, could have
been as good a quarterback as
there is in the country. But that’s
not going to happen this year,"
said Gottfried. “But I have tre-
mendous conﬁdence in Alex. I
believe Alex will overcome his
inexperience and really do a good
job for us.”

Van Pelt’s last game experi-
ence was in his senior year in
high school, when he led Win-
ston Churchill High School to the
Texas SA quarterfinals. He com-
pleted 107 of 229 passes for 1,275
yards and 12 touchdowns. He

 

added 695 yards rushing on 140
attempts.

. Van Pelt started his high school
career at a small West Virginia
school, but moved to San Anto-
nio after his sophomore year to

play for a bigger school that at- I

tracted more college scouts.

He completed nine of 22 passes
for 111 yards in the 1989 Blue-
Gold game held in April.

  Panthers‘ swarming defensive line up to the task    



By Chris Kuzneski
For The Pitt News

National Championship. If
those two words are mentioned
to any college football player in

A the Country, his eyes will light up

and a smile will cross his face.
Every athlete dreams of winning
a national title, but this goal is
unrealistic to most.

There are players, however, at
the University of Pittsburgh
dreaming of a National Champi-
onship. Wait a second! Pitt went
only 6-5 last year and_ lost their
starting QB as well. How is Pitt
going to win half their ball games,
let alone a National Champion-

" ship?

The answer is simple. Defense.
If ever there was a defense that

A was capable of carryin_g a team to

a title, it is Pitt’s defense this
season. When considering that
Pitt has two All-American candi-
dates in its secondary (Alonzo
Hampton and Louis Riddick) and
two more candidates at linebacker
(Curtis Bray and Ricardo
McDonald), it is obvious that Pitt
has a talented defensive unit.
Many believe the key to a
successful defense is the defen-
sive line, and fortunately for the
Panthers, that is where most of
their talent lies. Simply put, Pitt is
thought by many to have the best
defensive line in the country.
“Obviously, we have a lot of
depth on defense,” said defen-
sive coordinator Bob Valesente.
“The strength of the defense will

, be the front four. I know they’re

physical, and they’re very in-

“ - tense.”

Intensity might not even be the
word for it.

Take starting left tackle Marc
Spindler, for example. He de-
scribes his style of play: “I like to
go crazy. I will gladly sacrifice my
body to hurt an opponent. Basi-
cally, I physically abuse them.”

It is this type of intensity that
has allowed Spindler to become
one of the best defensive tackles
in the nation. Recently, Spindler
was rated the top defensive tackle
and the second—best defensive
underclassman in the country by
T be P0orMans Guide to the NFL

defensive football is all about.
He’s hungry to play football,”
said D’Alonzo. “I’m sure he's
going to terrorize some people
this year. He’ll go to the death.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 28, I989

Coach Gottfried has moved Louis Riddick from strong safety to free safety

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Last year, Pitt’s defense faced
off against two of the nation’s top
quarterbacks, West Virginia’s
Major Harris and Notre Dame’s
Tony Rice.

Pitt held Harris to just 61.yards
passing and Rice to only 97. In
fact, Pitt was tough on all the
quarterbacks it faced, and fin-
ished second in the nation in
pass defense. Boston College’s
Mike Power was the only quar-
terback to throw for more than
200 yards against Pitt.

This was a tribute to the whole
defense, but especially to the
secondary. Safeties Troy Wash-
ington and Louis Riddick, along
with cornerbacks Cornell Hol-
loway and Alonzo Hampton,
made up the stingy secondary
last year.

Holloway and Washington
-won't return due to graduation
and are looking for playing time
in the NFL. Holloway, who had
two interceptions for Pitt last
season, was taken in the 10th
round of the NFL draft by the
Cincinnati Bengals.

Washington wasn’t drafted, but
signed with the Phoenix Cardi-
nals as a free agent shortly after
the draft. He was, however, cut in
mid-August. Washington was tied
with Burt Grossman as the third
leading tackler for Pitt last year
with 71 total tackles.

Hampton returns and will play
left cornerback for the Panthers
this year. Riddick, a junior who
played strong safety last year,
will switch to free safety this year.

Consistent pass coverage primary goal of secondary

Dan Crossman, a senior who

played fullback last year, will
return to his original position of
strong safety. The other corner-
back position will be filled by
either Steve Israel or Dave Cole-
man.

Pitt will face both Harris and
Rice again this year, along with
other tough quarterbacks. Pitt
secondary coach Nick Rapone
thinks Pitt’s success against the
pass this year will depend on
whether Israel or Coleman can
come through with big years.

“We’l1 only be as strong as our
weakest player, so that corner
has to come through,” said Rap-
one. “But they’ll have the veter-
ans there to help them out, and I
expect a great season from the
secondary.”

The veteran everyone is ex-
pecting big things from this year
is Hampton. His live intercep-
tions and 58 tackles last year
helped him build a reputation as
being one of the best pass de-
fenders in the country.

Hampton, a 6-foot, 195-pound

senior, was chosen as a presea-

son All-American by numerous
publications, including T79eSp07t—
mg News and Football Digest.
He’s not letting the increased
media attention get to him,
though.

“I don’t feel any pressure,
because that’s all preseason rat-
ings,” said Hampton. “That’s
wherelwanttobeby the end of
the year, but I don’t feel any
added pressure because that’s
where people expect me to be.”

But Hampton does have big

Q: Is there a big diﬂerence be-

it’s going to be a key for us to play
every game like we’re playing
the National Championship. We
have to play all 11 games hard for
us to get that important number
12.

Q: Why did you choose Pitt
over some of the otherschools you
could have gone to, lilee Notre
Dame or Penn State?

A: I always liked the Pitt tradi-
tion of being a hard-nosed foot-
ball team. Academically, lit’sl a
pretty sound school, and it’s close a
to my hometown. I’m really close
to my family, and that was an
important thing to me. There’s a
lot of other schools that are good,
and I have nothing against {them},
but Pitt seemed to be the best
place for me. It turned out I’m .
doing pretty decent, so I have no
regrets, and I’m really enjoying
my time at Pitt.

Q: Have you thought a lotabout
the NFL?

A: I think everybody dreams
about playing in the NFL. Proba-
bly everyone in this room -
players, coaches, reporters, pho-
tographers —has dreamt about
it. But if I dwell on it too much, I
think it will take away from my
play now. This is the most impor-
tant time for me, now, because if
I don’t havea good year, I'm not
going to be in the pros anyway.
If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to
be."I'hat’s all.I have control over:
myself. '

Q: What would you be doing if
you weren ’t playing football?

A: I’d probably still be in school

for a while. Maybe I would have “ .

gone for pre-med. I was inter-
ested in that coming out of high
school. But I figured with the
time I had to give to football, I

I couldn’t make it. It can be done,

but I didn’t think I could do both
with the intensity that I like to do
things with.

Q: When did you start playing .

' football?

A: I started playing football
when I was 7—years—old. I contin-
ued to play on through to junior
high and high school.’

Q: Were you always biggerthan
everybody else? .

A: Yeah, when I was 9 and 10
I always had to play with the 12-
and 13-year-olds in the midget
leagues.

Q: Did that help you out at all?

A: Yeah, I got my butt whacked
a little bit. Then my older brother
Joe told me “Well, you know you
have to start giving it out a little,
instead of sitting there taking it.”
Then I got to play with kids my
own age in junior high school,
and I started remembering all
those hits that I got and started
giving them out. It’s a little more
fun that way.

Q: You’re a nice guy off the
ﬁeld. You cant be a good line-

. man and be nice about it on the

field. How do you not be a nice
guy on the field? A

A: I think too many football
players have to carry a bad im-
age, like they have to be hard
guys off the field and portray this
big killer image. For me, when I
go out and practice and I go out
and play, that’s the time for me to

work hard and try to knock people‘;

over and be nasty or whatever

you want to say. But when I’m off
the ﬁeld and something is bug-
ging me, I get moody at times,
but I think you have to be a
decent person as well. Football is
an important aspect of my life,
but being a good person is some-
thing that is really important to
me. My parents brought me up

that way. My dad never played a

down of football, and ifI can be
half the person he is, I’d consider

myself pretty successful in life.
Q: What do you think of your
opponent? Do you hate him or is
it all just competition?
A: I want to knock his face in

I the ground, but I don't hate him.

After the game we can talk a lot
and things like that. I’m sure if
there’s someone I didn’t like a
lot, like after the play they give a
little cheap shot, I get a little
angry about that. I want to hurt
him a little bit and bang him up,

Caliguire shows his versatility by playing special
teams.

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

For three years, Bill Cherpak
labored as a reserve offensive
lineman for the Pitt Panthers,
ﬁlling tackle and guard positions
left open by injuries and spotting
for the starters, game in and game
out. A "

The coaches always said he
was good enough to be a starter
in his own right, but overtaking
the likes of Tom Ricketts, Mark
Stepnoski, Dean, Caliguire, Ro-
man Matusz or Chris Goetz would
be no easy task. Besides, a- versa-
tile reserve like Cherpak was not
easy to find, and he was consid-
ered something of a sixth starter.

that he first showed as a first-
team All-American at Steel Valley
High School, and the skills that
he developed as a Panther re-
serve, Cherpak ﬁnds himself listed
as a third-team guard hoping just
to make it back into uniform for
the fourth game of the season, at
West Virginia. .

“I’m at the point now where,
well,’ I’m not used to it or dis-
gusted with it, but it came as no
surprise,” Cherpak said during
Pitt’s training camp injohnstown,
where he was limited to coach-
ing some of the younger offen-
sive linemen. (One of those line-
men, Calvert Jones, who was
expected to be a starter, quit the
team on August 19th.)

“I can’t wait until WVU,” he
said. “I want to play.”

Physicians originally informed
him that he would have to sit out
at least six games before his in-

jury, which required the removal
of a ruptured disc and the shav-
ing of vertebrae in May, would
fully heal. A rigorous summer
rehabilitation program brought

' him two games closer to the

starting role he covets but can
only seem to glimpse from afar.

With the absence of Stepnoski
and Ricketts, Cherpak’s_ experi-
ence could be invaluable to an
offensive line that is solid but not
steeped in game situations. Of
the 15 linemen other than Cher-
pak, nine are freshmen or sopho-

“I don’t think depth’s going to
be I a big problem,” Cherpak
observed. “We’ve got a good eight,

on the line. If he recovers fully

A THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 28, 1989

L

A Wild-eyed lookat sports in the city of champions

.j A few‘ personal thoughts on
sports life here at Pitt: ’
0 Just as I was getting excited

7” about the return of Marc Spindler

and Tony Siragusa to the defen-

E sive line, and Hosea Heard to the ,

receiving corps, other players
have to screw it up.

Bill Cherpak won’t be playing
‘for at least three games due to a

_,_,neck injury and ensuing surgery.
' "’ herpak, a senior, was supposed

to fill in for All-American Mark
Stepnoski, who graduated last
year. Add to that the loss of Tom
Ricketts, who also graduated, and
it’s like losing three starting of-
fensive linemen.

Darnell Dickerson and Yusef
Washington won’t be returning
due‘ to academics. Old news.

Second-string quarterback Larry
Wanke, unhappy with his play-

’ ing time at Pitt, transferred to

John Carroll, 31 Division III school,
before he knew the news of
Dickerson. Tell me he’s not bang-
ing his head against a wall some-
where.

It also remains to be seen
whether Pitt’s leading receiver
last year, ‘Henry Tuten, will be
able to play. See pagelC-8.

i 0 With the return of Spindler
«maid Siragusa and some new faces
to be added_to an already awe-
some defensive line, Pitt is about

as deep as Mariana’s Trench at
that position. A

It reminds me of 1985 when
Pitt had running backs Charles
Gladman, Craig Heyward, A.B.

rﬁrown, Eugene Napolean, and

Brian Davis all on the roster.
Brown and Napolean trans-

ferred to WVU. Davis left be-

cause of academic problems.

Gladman had other problems at
Pitt and didn’t finish his career
here. Heyward was the only one
of those five to have a successful
career at Pitt.

Wouldn't it be nice if teams
could trade in college football?

Pitt could have traded three
top quality backs and in return
filled the holes they had in 1985
when they finished 5-S-1.

How about a trade this year?
Adam Walker and Curvin Richards
are both tremendous backs play-
ing the same position. That and
the deep defensive line could
settle any quarterback question
there might be. Say, Walker and
Siragusa for Major Harris?

0 Another running back I’m
lookinglforward to seeing this
year is freshman Jimmer Bundy.
HeTs listed at 5-10, 2/i0—pounds,
but at camp he looked more like
270-280. With that size it was
inevitable that he would be
compared to “Ironhead” Hey-
ward. In camp as he was plowing
over the smallerlinebackers, he
definitely showed signs of “Iron-

head.” His power and the moves

of Richards and Walker could
make a dangerous backﬁeld.

0 Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
said when he came to Pitt in
1986, “I’ve always had a goal to
win a national championship, and
here at the University of Pitts-
burgh you have the opportu-
nity.” C ‘ .

Hey, I would settle for the top
20! It’s.his fourth year here, and
Pitt has yet to consistently break
into the topi20 under his com-
mand. Once Pitt gets to the top
20, it’s a tough road to No. 1. Just
ask Syracuse. In the last two

years the Orangemen have had a
combined 21-2-1 record and have
yet to boast of a national champi-
onship. Gottfried’s record at Pitt
is 19-14-1.

0 Time to stop complaining
about Pitt’s schedule that includes
Pacific and East Carolina. Just
about every top team has a couple
games that aren't so tough. Notre
Dame plays two military schools,
Navy and Air Force. (Navy is also

 

on Pitt’s schedule.) Miami’s sched-
ule is a joke. They open the

season against Wisconsin, who‘

went 1-10 last year. Their sched-
ule includes only four teams with
winning records in 1988 (Pitt
being one of them).

West Virginia opens with Ohio’s
Ball State (Yes, the same Ball
State that eliminated Pitt from the
NCAA basketball _tournament in

the first round last year). Ball.

State was 8-5 last year, but they
beat the likes of Toledo and
Massachusetts. They did play
Michigan last year, though. East-
ern, Western and, of course,
Central,'but not the University of
Michigan. Good Luck with that
one, Mountaineers. WVU’s sched-
ule also includes another Ohio
“powerhouse,” Cincinnati.

I hate to admit it, but Penn State
is about the only school with any
guts this year and is playing all
good teams. Temple and Mary-

land are the easiest games for the I

Nittany Lions. In 1988 their oppo-
nents had a combined .608 win-
ning percentage.

All of the aforementioned teams
also play some very tough com-
petition. (although Miami only
plays two teams with more than
six victories in 1988). Pitt plays
the No. 1, No.2 and No. 5 teams
in the nation from last year in
Notre Dame, Miami and WVU.

So I won’t complain about the
schedule. My gripe is why Pacific
and East Carolina are home and
WVU and Notre Dame turned out
to be away. Oh well, I guess I
wouldsrather see two teams with
a combined record of 5-17 than
the two teams that played for the
national championship last year
anyway.

0 Did you like Pitt basketball

\ last year? I mean, did you really

like it? I hope so, because it’s
going to be about the same this
year. Pitt started five sophomores,
and a junior came off the bench;
therefore, no one that saw sub-

stantial playing time has gradu— ‘

ated. Pitt had an excellent recruit-
ing year, getting some much
needed height and adding some
desperately needed depth. Too
bad not one of Pitt’s recruits met

a the academic standards ‘needed

in order to play in college. So you
can throw out last season’s year-
book, because this season’s will
look about the same.

oPlaying intramural softball this
summer was almost fun. The
games were played at Pitt Sta-

the corner of the end zone). The

only the auxiliary lights on.‘The

There were no umpires to make
the calls. In other words, the

were scheduled; of those four, at
least one would be _canceled

very few things more frustrating

The way they select playoff

Scott Kaplan will be battling Jeff Vanliorne for the kicking
duties.

 

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

One would think that Pitt’s
kicking team would be a little
apprehensive about their ﬁrst
game, their ﬁrst punt, their first
extra point and their first field

has had its share of problems in
the last few years. But if you were
to talk to punter Brian Greenﬁeld
or place-kicker Scott Kaplan, you
would get the impression that
these guys are actually looking
forward to the pressure. .-
Greenﬁeld is a transfer punter
from Glendale Junior College in
California. He has brought Out-
standing credentials with him.
A Greenﬁeld was the nation’s lead-
ing junior college punter last
season, averaging 47.5 yards per
kick. His punts also have an
impressive hang time of 4.8 sec-
onds. Greenﬁeld was a second-

team All-American, who had 15.

punts over 51 yards last year.

goal. After all, Pitt’s kicking team"

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 73, I989 S 

Pitt’s punter last year, Yusef
Washington, is academically in—
eligible for the 1989 season.
Washington averaged 37.0 yards
per kick for the Panthers last
season.

Greenﬁeld is aware that Pitt’s
punters have lacked consistency,
but he is not worried about Pitt’s
past punting troubles.

“The pressure here is just like
everything else in life; I can do
the job,” said Greenﬁeld.

Pitt head football coach Mike
Gottfried not only thinks Green-
field is capable, he called him a
weapon.

f‘IGreenﬁeldI has answered the
questions at punter; he has the
ability, and will fill the position
well,” said Gottfried.

Pitt special teams coach Scott
O’Brien said, “Brian is a punter
with consistency. As long as the
transition from schools is made,
he will be prepared mentally for
this level of competition-”

consistent performer on the line,
and a ferocious pass»rusher,” said
D’Alonzo.

Sims said he doesn't feel any
pressure starting in front of a
talented lineman like Siragusa.

“I just have to perform, and ifI
don’t, Siragusa will step in and
perform for me. If anything, it’s
good to know that I have some-
one competent behind me,” said
Sims.

Carnel Smith will get the start-
ing nod at one defensive end.

Smith has been a fixture at
defensive end for some time, and
with his experience, Smith is able
to provide leadership for the rest
of the defense.

“Camel is highly respected by
his teammates and has the play-

fense. He is the leader. Camel is

the glue that holds the defense -

together,” said D’Alonzo.

Whodoes Pitt have to fill Burt
Grossman’s shoes at defensive
end, and how can he possibly
provide the big plays that Gross-
man did?

Mark Gunn, a junior college
transfer, will fill his spot on the
line. Equipped with great speed
and quickness, the 6-foot-5 de-
fensive end appears destined for
a great career at Pitt.

said D’Alonzo.

Before attaining stardom,
however, Gunn is concerned
about more immediate things,
such as making the transition
from Merced Junior College to a
Division I football factory.

“It’s going to be a big adjust-
ment that I’m going to have to
make,” said Gunn. “The pace is
much faster, and the guys are
much stronger and smarter. It’s
going to be hard, but hopefully
things will work out and I’ll suc-

Pitt is also blessed with tre-

“We have some question marks

. was nice enough to give me time,

and we built a relationship.”

Even though Rapone is only 33
years old, he already possesses
some impressive coaching cre-
dentials. During his 11-year ca-
reer, Rapone has coached at East
Tennessee State, Temple and the
University of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh?

“Yes. In 1979 and 1980, Iwas a
graduate assistant here at Pitt.
Coach Jackie Sherill had a junior
varsity team, and I was head
coach. I also assisted Ron Dicker-
son in the secondary. You know,
I’m really glad I’m back. I don’t
want to leave Pitt again. I've
waited 11 years to get back to
Pittsburgh. See, I’m from New
Castle, and this is football tradi-
tion. I don’t want to leave, and I
don’t plan on leaving.”

On the other hand, new offen-
sive coordinator Paul Hackett is
generally considered one of the
best offensive minds in the coun-
try, and is considered likely to be
hired for a head coaching posi-
tion in the next few years. For
now, however, Hackett is con-
tent coaching at Pitt. p

“Right now, I’m happy to be
here. All coaches, however, in

. the back of their minds are hop-

ing for the right opportunity to
come along.”

Until that time, the University
of Pittsburgh will benefit greatly
from Hackett’s offensive exper-
tise and his fine tradition of coach-
ing winners. During his 20-year

: coaching career, Hackett has

coached for a Super Bowl Cham-
pion (San Francisco in 1984), an
NCAA Champion (USC in 1979)
and four different NFL playoff
teams. Coach Hackett feels he
can help establish a winning tra-
dition at Pitt.

“It takes a total commitment by
the coaching staff and the players
to get the little things done to get
aver the hump,” said Hackett.
“This is a good football team, but
when you look at the schedule,
we are playing against the best
teams in the country. Our ability
to keep intensity and concentrate
with consistency is going to be
the key.”

The other addition to Pitt’s 1989
coaching staff is running—back
coach Larry Kirksey. Kirksey, a
veteran coach with 15 years of
experience, joined Gottfried’s staff
last spring after a 5-year stint with
the University of Florida.

While at Florida, Kirksey
coached many talented backs
(John L. Williams, Neal Ander-
son, Lorenzo Hampton, George
Adams, and Emmitt Smith), but
he feels current Pitt stars Curvin
Richards and Adam Walker more
than hold their own.

“They’re just as talented as the
other guys I coached. It’s neces-
sary for them, however, to go out
and do the little things to become
better players,” said Kirksey.

Kirksey, a 38-year-old Kentucky
native, was head coach at Ken-
tucky State University in 1985.
Prrbr to that, he was the receivers
and tight-ends coach at Kansas

and the University of Kentucky. ----------n

Clever. Scott Miller, a starter in
two games last year, will provide
depth on the offensive line.

Pitt should once again" have
one of the top defenses in the
country, if not the best.

Pitt’s defensive line is very deep
with talent. Carnell Smith should
start at one end, while the other
end will be filled by either junior
college transfer Mark Gunn, Rich-
ard Allen, or Todd Pipkin.

The tackles will be just as deep.
Marc Spindler returns and will
handle left side. Tom Sims will
start at the right side, backed up
by a returning Tony Siragusa.
Sims was the second" leading
tackler for Pitt last season with 78
sacks. Jeff Esters will also see

plenty of time at tackle.

Pitt has two of the best young
linebackers in the country, Curtis
Bray and Ricardo McDonald. Last
year they combined for 121 tack-
les as freshmen. Nelson Walker
will replace All-American middle
linebacker Jerry Olsavsky. Craig
Gob will also play a lot in the
middle. Prentiss Wright should
see so much time at linebacker
that he can almost be considered
a starter.

Pitt’s secondary is much the
same as their offensive line,
combining experience and inex-
perience. All-American candidate
Alonzo Hampton will play left
cornerback. Either Steve Israel or
Dave Coleman will play right

strong safety. Dan Crossman, who
played fullback last year, will
play strong safety. Reserves in
the secondary include Robert
Bradley, Doug Hetzler, Marcus
Washington and Barry Threats.

Pitt solved its punting prob-
lems by getting junior college
transfer Brian Greenﬁeld. Green-
ﬁeld averaged 47.5 yards per punt
last year at Glendale JC.

Scott Kaplan and Jeff Van Horn
will battle for the place kicking
spot. Kaplan started last year and
scored 53 points. Van Horn has
132 career points for Pitt.

Some freshmen to watch in
1989:

0 Jimmer Bundy, a 5-11, 240-

pound running back. He gained
over 3,000 yards in his high school
career. With his size and speed,
he is already being compared to
Craig “Ironhead” Heyward.

0 Keith Hamilton, a 6-7, 272-
pound defensive end. Hamilton
was a Parade Magazine All-
American last year. His talent
adds more depth to an already
deep defensive line.

0 Orlanda Truitt, a 6-1, 190- _

pound wide receiver. T ruitt was a
first-team All—State in Alabama

expectations for this year's sec-

ondary as a whole.

“This secondary has a chance
to be better than the secondary
from last year, and that says a lot, ”
said Hampton. “This year, we
have enough talent and depth to
be up for any challenge.”

Rapone thinks Hampton’s pre-
season honors are well-deserved
and expects Riddick to step up
another level of play.

WR's

“Hampton is definitely one of
the best in the country. At this
point, Riddick could be, but he
has to go out and perform well,”
said Rapone.

Riddick, a junior,.was honored
as a “Fiesta Bowl Samaritan All-
American” this year for his play-
ing ability and sportsmanship.

Riddick, 6-3, 210-pounds, was
sixth for the Panthers in tackles
last year, with 65. In 1987, Rid-
dick averaged 4.4 yards on 40

rushing attempts as a fullback for
Pitt. '

Riddick will concentrate only
on defense and thinks Pitt will
have one of the best in the coun-
try.

v“By the end of the year we
could be one of the best defen-
sive secondaries in the country.
That’s our goal, that should be

everybody’s goal,” said Riddick. .

“We’re just going to try to carry
our weight and help out the

defense, because we have some
tremendous defensive linemen
and linebackers. It should be
interesting, because we’re
loaded."

Crossman feels comfortable
making the switch back to safety
this year.

“Actually, this switch is a lot
easier than, the last switch to
fullback. I remember everything
from when I played safety be-
fore,” said Crossman. “It’s all

Continued from page C-8
Last year, Williams had 21 catches
for 357 yards. He has 78 career
receptions and 1,256 yards. He is
hoping for big things from the
Pitt team this year.’

He said, “Everyone is tired of
losing, and it’s time to win.”

Peete said, “We will look to
in crucial situations
because he has been there be-
fore. We expect great. things from
him this year.”

Sophomore Bouyer will be

expected to contribute behind
Tuten at split end this season.
Bouyer made three catches for 25
yards in three appearances last
season.

“Chris has gotten stronger and
a little quicker. He understands
routes. He’s the kind of player
who will be in the right position
to make a big play,” said Peete.

Jackson saw action in all 11
games last season. He also con-
tributed as a short yardage rusher
and returned kickoffs, while

backing up Tuten and graduate

Billy Osbourne.

“Baron runs some great routes.
He has good, soft hands, great
concentration, and catches the
ball with ease,” said Peete. “He’s
still a little inexperienced, but
with more playing time, Baron
will be a great receiver.”

Heard has also been named
preseason second team All-Major
Independent. Heard sat out last
season for disciplinary reasons,

but his 1987 performance should-

be a good indication of what to
expect from him. As a sopho-
more, Heard had six receptions
for 165 yards. He led the team
with 27.2 yards per catch, includ-
ing a memorable 47-yard touch-
down reception to start the sea-
son against Brigham Young.

Heard will most likely be shar-
ing ﬂanker responsibilities with
Williams.

Heard played on the 1984 USA

sive side of the ball.”

Rapone has no worries about
Crossman being able to make the
adjustment.

“He has already responded
well. I think he can come back
and be one of the better safeties
in the east, without a doubt,” said
Rapone.

Crossman made 19 tackles for
Pitt as a safety in 1987. Last year
he gained 273 yards rushing and
caught 12 passes as the Panthers’
fullback.

Excitement turned into amaze-
ment at how bad a team can play
at times. In one game, the Pirates
had somebody from_the Mets in
a rundown between first and
second. In professional baseball

even the fastest runner against .5

the worst defense shouldn’t get
safely to ‘either base. The Pirates
had him dead at first. One prob-

lem: no one was covering first.

The ball sailed up the first base
line toward the stands. The Met
arrived safely into second base.

0 The Pirates did win. that game, m.

however. Rey Quinones hit a
dramatic ninth—inning home run

' ‘to give the Bucs the win. Of

course Quinones is no longer
with the Pirates; they released

' him for nothing. That's right, they

didn’t even try to get anybody for
him, noteven some minor league
prospects. That ranks up there
with the Pirates trying to trade
Glen Wilson for Alan Ashby, U
washed-up catcher. Larry
Doughty is deﬁnitely no Sid Thrift

0 The most irritating thing about
watching the Pirates: watching
the whole game with the Pirates
winning up till the ninth inning
andseeing them blow their lead.
I can think of a million other
things I would have rather done
with those three hours.

ball. Take the Pittsburgh Gladi- '

  Hampton has doubl

Alonzo Hampton plays a dual role for the Panthers.

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

The punt returner for a football
team is often over—looked and
taken for granted, as are the
special teams as a whole. If he
gains 3 or 4 yards a return, people
are happy and look forward to
seeing the offense come on the
field.

However, if he can break some
long runs or consistently get 10
yards per return, the team greatly
benefits from it. Good ﬁeld posi-
tion is very important to a game,
and the punt returner has the

potential to get good field posi-

tion every time.

Fortunately for Pitt, they have
one of the best punt returners in
the nation: Alonzo Hampton.

Hampton, 6-foot, 195-pounds,

e-billing in Panthers’ strategy

averaged over 10 yards per re-
turn for a total of 360 yards last
season for Pitt. He broke one
return for a 71-yard touchdown
against Northern Iowa. He ranked
14th in the nation in punt returns
last year.

The Poor Mans Guide to the
NFL Draft selected Hampton as

the preseason No. 1-rated punt ,

returner in the nation among
juniors and seniors.

Hampton isalso a preseason
All—American cornerback for the
Panthers. He says he likes play-
ing the two positions and is set-
ting his punt-returning goals high.

“I like the dual role a lot,” said
Hampton. “If I have a chance to
break one here and there, it only
makes the team better. Iwant to
be the leading punt returner in
the country this year.” 2

They ﬁnished the remainder of

O the season undefeated and kept

their title hopes alive, beating
South Carolina 37-9 in the Gator
Bowl. Unfortunately, Georgia
completed. a 12-0 season by
beating Notre Dame in the Sugar
Bowl, 17-10, and took home the
national championship. Pitt fin-
ished second in the polls. \
“The 1980 football team played
together and had great continuity
and believed ‘in one another,”
said Sunseri, now the linebacker
coach at Pitt. “The memories I
have of playing are the ones of
going into a football game know-
ing what we stood for at the
University of Pittsburgh. We were
a totally dominating defensive
and offensive team, and it felt

V good.” "

S 1981: Pitt returned many tal-
ented players from 1980’s No. 2
team, and was still feeling the
sting of coming ’so close the
previous year. They started out
the season determined not to be
denied the championship again.

9' In their first 10 games, they beat

their opponents by an average of
more than 25 points per game,
including a 42-14 victory over
last year's nemesis Florida State.
But their final game of the regular

. season is the classic example of
f why Pitt and Penn State, are bitter
- rivals.

-Pitt entered the game with the
No. 1 ranking in the country.
Penn State was also highly ranked

_ and had Todd Blackledge and .
a Curt Warner leading their offense.

The cold, snowy weather brought
a bad prophecy to the Pitt foot-
ball team. Penn State hammered
Pitt 48-14 and crushed their hopes

0 Sweeney,

of the national championship.
Pitt finished the season with an
11-1 record by beating 1981
champs Georgia in the Sugar
Bowl, V24-20. Pitt finished fourth
in the polls, and Penn State fin-
ished third. Sunseri, Marino, split
end Julius Dawkins and offen-
sive tackle Jimbo Covert were

All-Americans for Pitt that year.

Marino threw for 2,876 yards and
57 touchdowns.

This was also the last year for
Coach She.rrill who moved to
Texas A&M. He ended his Pitt
career with a SO-9-1 record.

1982: Serafino “Foge” Fazio

took over as Pitt’s head coach. _

Pitt was once again the No. 1-

ranked team in the nation before

the season. They faced a tough
schedule though, facing four
preseason Top 20 teams. Pitt was
rolling through the season under
the leadership of Fazio and All-
Americans Bill Maas (defensive
tackle), Covert and Bill Fralic
(offensive tackle), who was a
sophomore. - . .

After a 63-14 victory over Lou-
isville, Pitt was 7-0 and still had
the No. 1 ranking in the polls.
Then came another rival, Notre
Dame. The Irish beat the Pan-
thers at Pitt Stadium, 31-16, and,
Pitt dropped to seventh in the
polls. Penn State defeated Pitt
again, and the Panthers lost to
SMU in the Cotton Bowl, 7-3. Pitt
finished the season with a» 9-3
record, the 10th rankedteam in
the nation.

1983: John Congemi took over
for Marino at ‘quarterback. Pitt
had the leadership of seniors Jim
Bill Mass, Dwight
Collins and Tom Flynn. Pitt started
off with a 2-2 record, and things

I

were looking gloomy. But the
Panthers rolled on to six con-

‘ secutive victories, including wins

over Notre Dame and Florida
State. Pitt and Penn State tied in
the final game of the regular
season 24-24, the last time the
rivals would end in a stalemate.

Pitt’s 28-23 loss to Ohio State in

the Fiesta Bowl brought the

Panthers to 8-3-1 on the year. It

would be their last bowl game .

until 1987. They finished the
season as the 18th-ranked team
in the country. Fralic was All-

American for the second year in '

a row.

1984: The roller coaster almost
fell off the tracks this season. Pitt
opened with a 14-20 defeat at the
hands of Brigham Young. That
was the first of four consecutive

losses to start the year. Pitt’s only

victories were against East Caro-
lina, Tulane and Penn State. They
also tied Navy and finished the
season 3-7-1. ,

The season was so bad that
after one of the losses, Fazio said
“I did a lot of soul searching. The
reﬂection of the team is a direct
reﬂection of the coach. I was so
disgusted afterward I puked.”

A bright spot for the Panthers
that season was three-time All-
American Fralic. He was a seri-
ous candidate for the Heisman
Trophy, which is rare for a line-
man. But Boston College’s Doug
Flutie made a miracle pass against
Miami and in so doing, tookthe
Heisman. Linebacker Chris Dole-
man was another quality player
on Pitt’s team. . _.

1985: The Panthers improved

their record, but only slightly, to

.5-5-1. Sophomore tailback Char-
les Gladman rushed for 1,085

yards, giving Pitt something to
look forward. Chuck Scales led

- the Panthers with 34 receptions.

Tony Woods led the defense with
1 5 sacks, and T eryl Austin picked
off seven passes.

No Panthers achieved All-
American status this year. ‘When
Pitt dropped three of their last
four games, including a 31-0 loss-
to Penn State in the ﬁnal game of
the season, it became clear that
Pitt was in need of a change. Late
in December 1985, Pitt replaced

“Fazio with Gottfried ' as head

coach.
- -1986: It was a year of numbers
before the start of the season. Pitt
turned 200, Gottfried was the
30th head coach in Pitt history
(the third in the '80s), and
Gottfried had two good quarter-
backs and two good tailbacks to
choose from. .
Congemi vs. Sal Genilla was
the quarterback challenge. Glad-
man and Craig Heyward were
the tailback choices. Congemi
won the quarterback fight but
got hurt in game eight, making
way for Genilla. Heyward rushed
for 756 yards to Gladman’s 409
yards- The most memorable of
Heyward’s yards came against
Miami in a rainy Pitt Stadium.
Heyward punished the Hurri-
canes’ defense for 254 yards
rushing. Vinnie Testaverde was
too tough, and Miami won 57-10.
When all was said and done,
Gottfried’s first year ended with
the same record as Fazio’s last, 5-
5-1. Pitt beat Notre ‘Dame and

West Virginia, but dropped" to ‘

Penn State. It was the third year
in a row the -Panthers hadn’t
made a bowl game. Offensive

“We’re trying to-work on all the

Sunseri. “I don’t think that, be-
cause of the success that they had
last year, that they played to their
full capabilities. I think that they

Richards simply replies, "I just
love to play football.”

Based on last season’s per-
formance, Richards does that well.
He became only the second Pitt
freshman to rush for more than
1,000 yards, joining Tony Dorsett
in that distinction. His 1,228 yards
was the seventh highest fresh-
man figure in NCAA history, and
he became only the 24th fresh-
man to break the 1,000-yard
barrier. He was rated as one of
the top 50 backs in the nation,

Richards is obviously in storied

I company. Yet his low-key per-

sonality and seeming disdain for
publicity have kept him on an
even keel.

Walker was much the same in
1988. He credited his teammates
with his accomplishments, and
simply ran the ball when he was
asked to. This year may be a little
different. When asked in an inter-
view with WPTS radio what the
offense might be like this season,
Walker said, “Hey diddle diddle,

it’s Adam up the middle.” While’

that may or may not be bra ‘P -

over 100 yards in every game,
finishing the season with 1,791.
He scored 78 points, leading Pitt
to the Bluebonnet Bowl.

Darnell Dickerson spent some
time at quarterback behind
Genilla, adding the option play’
to the Pitt offense‘ for the first time
in years. Ezekial Gadson led the
defense with 137 tackles and a
record-setting 24.5 sacks. Marc

“I’m ready. I know the system
pretty well now,” said Van Pelt. “I
need to get all the experience
that I can get early, so when I go
into the tougher games, I won’t
be lacking in anything.

“I don't think the quarterback

Quarterback Alex Van Pelt

position is a question mark any
more. We're working fine on
offense. The talent that the of-
fense has with the receivers and
the line and the backs; that’s a
threat right there. So the quarter-
back just has to do his job, and it
will all come together.”
All-American candidate center
Dean Caliguire feels Van Pelt will
be a valuable addition to the
Panther offense. _
“Alex is adjusting really well so
far, and ‘I think Alex has the
capability to be a great quarter-
back,” said Caliguire. _“He showed
me- a lot in the off-season. He’s
throwing the ballwell and mov-

Alex at all.” A
Van Pelt feels the ability of
running backs Curvin Richards
and Adam Walker will take some
of the pressure off him and make
his job easier. He stressed that
their abilities will make the play-
action pass more effective, be-
cause the defenses will have to

concentrate more on them.

Van Pelt also said that Pitt’s big
offensive line is giving him more
confidence going into the sea-
son.

“Those guys are awesome. We
have a couple young guys that
are going to have to step it up a
little bit, but tl1ey’re doing a great
job, I have all the faith in the
world in our offensive line,” said
Van Pelt. » ‘

Another quarterback that the
big line may be blocking for is
junior college transfer Scott Stark.
Stark is considered Pitt’s second
quarterback behind Van Pelt.

Stark played for Saddleback’

Community College last season.
He completed 120_of 248 passes
for 1,824 yards and seven touch-
downs. He also punted for a
38.4-yard average.

He also brings some valuable

NCAA quarterback, experience-

He’ played at Stanford in 1987
and started a game against UCLA
in which he completed six of 15

passes.

According to Pitt offensive If

coordinator Paul Hackett, Stark is
a smart quarterback with a quick
release. -

“Stark isthe same type of player . I

as Van Pelt, except that he’s a

little older,” said Gottfried. “He’s

a drop—back-type quarterback.
He’s not a running quarterback

as such, but can take off with it.”,

Stark’s' punting experience
could be a big asset to Pitt, bring-

ing a new dimension to Pitt’s I

offense. Brian'Greenfield, another
junior college transfer, will be
handling the majority of the

punting duties, but Stark may get‘

the call in certain situations.

“They have a certain formation A

for me on short-medium punts;
that way therewill be a multiple
set where I can either throw or
punt. It gives the defense a differ-

ent look; they’re not sure what‘

I'm going to do,” said Stark.

Showcase Soundings: a summer selection

9‘ (Various Artists)

Live at the Knitting Factory
A&M

In a June issue of loud and
long about the lack of
adventurous, avant-garde jazz at
the local Mellon Jazz Festival.
What does he expect? This is
Pittsburgh. In New York City,

'”“ however, the art of improvisation

has already progressed to the
point where the music produced
can no longer be considered just
jazz or even “fusion,” and the
lgroundbreakers such as John
Zorn and Elliot Sharp have
become international luminaries.
The whole Lower East Side
improv scene has for several years
small
performance space on Houston
Street called the Knitting Factory.
The first attempt by the
proprietors of the Knitting Factory
to spread the word about their
tremendously creative improv
scene came in the form of the
Live at the Knitting Factory radio
series, which was featured weekly
on nearly 75 stations in North
America. Often, however, these
radio shows were preaching to

A‘__ the already converted, because

they failed to reach the listeners
of the 500 other college and
community radio stations whose
airwaves were infested with REM
and other crap.

Luckily, the Knitting Factory
struck an amiable deal with A&M
which now allows the music to

‘ reach the masses through the

Live at the Knitting Factory
compilation released this summer.
Like the radio series, the LP

showcases some of the lesser-
known improv artists who are
already worshiped by those in
the know, but who need much
more exposure.

The compilation begins with two

—\

1

very talented ensembles
Curlew and Bosho. The lineup of
Curlew, which includes T om Cora
(formerly of Skeleton Crew),

blends avant—jazz inﬂuences such
as Sun Ra and Ornette with a

graceful power that really rocks

without sounding anything

remotely like rock music. Bosho

are much more of a rock setup,

but with the inﬂuence ofjapanese

folk music and world beat

percussion.

Two more groups also shine on

this LP. Scanners, a combo of
improv heavyweights Elliot Sharp,

David Linton and Percy Jones,
initiate a massive funk throwdown
that could work as a chase scene
sound track in a futuristic film.
Originally from Austin, Texas,
the trio known as Miracle Room
beatsout a hypnotizing industrial
drone, halfway between Hunting
Lodge and Savage Republic, with
Arabic overtones.

The sensitive string duet by Hans
Reichel and Tom Cora, and the
Lounge Lizards—derived sound of
the Jazz Passengers also have
their bright moments.

For more great music from the

album’s participants, Iwould urge
enthusiasts to investigate Curlew’s
Live In Berlin and Bosho’s Chop
Socley LP. It would also be
completely relevant to check out
anything by other Loisada
improvisors such as Bobby
Previte, Elliot Sharp ‘(or his various
projects), Zeena Parkins, Gregg
Bendian and many others. And
don't forget to sample a show at
the Knitting Factory when you’re
in the Big Apple. This LP is an
introduction, but there’s much,
much more.

sounds like something from their
last LP, or this whole record would
have been close to perfect.

The most important aspect 0%

this record is its intense message
of involvement. Anyone who’s
been around Ian MacKaye knows
the concern and dedication of
the D.C. scene toward various
worthwhile causes, such as the
Community for Creative Non—
Violence and the American Civil
Liberties Union, who benefit from
the sales of this LP. pi

Thorns, another new band with
a raw punk ﬂavor, sums it up in
the song “Responsibility” —— (“Do
you know where your money
goes/What's being done in your
name/Realize that everything you
do/Can make so much difference
 If you don’t like greed and
exploitation/Don’t support the
people who do it.”)

Take your youthful anger and
channel it toward some positive
results. Get State of the Union

Half Life
 Never Give In
Skyclad

While many local bands have

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, August 28, T989

More Soundin s 

produce albums, Half Life sets a
milestone by being the first area
hard—core/punk group to release
a full-length LP.

Never Give In was preceded by
Under The Knife (a 7-inch EP), 1

GotItBad . .. And IbatAin’t Good
(a single), two demo cassettes
and a relatively successful North
American tour. The LP builds its
sound from a base of early 19803
English punk, such as Discharge,

The members of Half Life: Troy Mezzio, Ron Volpe, Rick Dowdle and Jeff Lamm.

Cockney Rejects and Sham 69,
overlayed with the furious pace
of todays thrash/speed metal
style.

Jeff Lamm (vocals) and Rick
Dowdle (guitar) are responsible
for a majority of the songs on
Never Give In, which seems to
reﬂect an awareness of their
surroundings and a need for
expression. Lam and Dowdle
are backed on the album by Troy
Mowat (bass) and Ron Volpe
(drums).

While earlier Half Life tunes
were filled with a youthful anger
that expressed the band's
apparent disapproval of
“normalcy,” Never Give In has a
more socially understanding ﬂare
to it. Lamm still spits out guttural,
bellowing vocals, and the music
hasn’t softened one bit, but the
lyrics have taken on an almost
anthemlike tone.

Each song ties in with the LP’s
underlying theme of standing up
for what you believe in, “never
giving in.” “Go Down Fighting,”

 

“Crawling,” and of course, “Never
Give In,” all rally around a

message centered on
individuality.
Musically, NeverGiveIn harbors

the traditional hard-core, stop-
and—go sound, but the band has
added some diverse rhythm
changes and there’s definitely a

, sense of straight—ahead rock ‘n’

roll influences.

Half Life is waiting to see how
NeverGive In sells before making
any plans for another extensive
tour.

There’s cause for celebration.
On Aug. 26 at 6 p.m., WPTS
marked its fifth anniversary. Since
‘taking 98.5 on the FM dial in
1984, WPTS has become one of
the major college radio stations
in the country.

WPT S marked its birthday with
a countdown of the top 98.5
records of its 5-year existence
and a birthday celebration which
included musical performances
from The Big Stuff, Fusebox, The
Shroud and the Heretics. More is
planned for the fall, including a
retrospective on the Pittsburgh
music scene and a grand scale
“Birthday Bash.”

“We’re trying to celebrate all

semester long," explains station
manager Frank Smigel.

WPGH, the Pitt AVI station,
was founded in 1961 by Adrian
Cronauer, the disc jockey later to
be immortalized by Robin
Williams ;n Good Morning
Vietnam. "n 1983, the university
filed for an FM license. At the
time, the non—commercial oand
(below 92 on the dial) was filled.

Pitt’s lawyers persuaded the
FCC to give their non—commercial
station a frequency in the
commercial band. To this day,
WPT S is one of the only college
radio stations in the country in
the commercial band.

Construction began in the fall
of 1985. A 10-watt transmitter
was put on top of the Cathedral
of Learning, giving WPTS roughly

a 30—mile radius.

By the next vear. the student—
run operation was fully underway,
finally going on the air Aug. 26,
1984. The first song played by the
station that would become
synonymous with new music was
“I Know There’s Something Going
On,” by Frieda, an ex—mate of the
soft—rock dinosaur ABBA.

“We’ve been doing penance
ever since,” says Smigel.

The station continued to play a
“mishmash of [album—oriented
rock],” until Patty Pisula (of The
Pleasureheads) changed. the
format to progressive rock in April

of 1985. Pisula’s changes were, as
Smigel savs, “met with a good
deal of resistance” from fans and
station personnel.

“\X/hen Husker Du’s ZenA1Cadei
entered the rotation, people were
afraid of it,” says Smigel.

But the new format stuck. Soon
progressive rock was joined by
special shows for jazz, reggae,
New Age and house music. The
rap shows on Friday night and
Sunday morning won awards,
and they still draw the biggest
audience.

WPTS’ short life coincides with
a significant change in pop music.

A great deal of music that couldn’t
be heard outside of college radio
five years ago has crossed into
the mainstream. 8

REM, who couldn’t get
commercial airplay five years ago,
has become a household name.
Suddenly, alternative music is big
business. WPTS and other college
stations must now face recordﬁ’
executives who, until recently.
didn’t know they existed.

Smigel says that some in the
record business y“treat us like f arm
product. They try to pressure us
into playing certain things. We

don’t let [record company] reps
tell us what to play.”

As a non—commercial station,
WPT S is free from the control
record companies have over other
stations. “The nice thing about
WPTS,” says Smigel, “is [that] it’;
a perfect training ground for DJS
and you don’t have to worry
about listeners. It doesn’t matter
‘whether we have one listener or
a million listeners.”

Above all else, WPTS is an
invaluable educational tool for
interested students. The}
equipment is all state—of-the"-art.

T “When you come. to WPTS,
you have the opportunity to do
everything you’d do at a real
radio station,” says Smigel. Many
students have gone on to careers
in radio broadcasting.

Of course, some are just in it for
the music. You’ll find people at _
WPT S that know more about
underground music than you can
possibly imagine. As once-
obscure bands like the Cute and
the Cult enter Bi1lboard’s Top 10
alongside Prince and Madonna,
you can be sure the folks at\X/PTS
will be probing today’s
underground scene with the
mettle and commitment they are
known for.

  The Bridge: a covertribute to Neil Young

By David Fricke
Rolling Stone Writer

Terry -Tolkin was 13 years old
when he bought his first Neil
Young album, Aftertbe GoldRusb,
in 1972. “Lyrically, it really spoke
to me as an adolescent,” he says,
“and I was hooked from there

On.

an ardent Young devotee who
also runs his own independent
label, No. 6 Records — has repaid
that debt of inspiration. The
Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young is
a compilation album of Neil
Young songs covered by 11 top
alternative-rock ‘acts, including
Nick Cave (“Helpless”), the Pixies
(“Winterlong”), Sonic Youth

(“Computer Age"), guitarist Henry
Kaiser (“The Needle and the
Damage Done” and “Tonight’s
the Night”) and Dinosaur Jr.
(“Lotta Love”).

Each track (there are 14 on the
CD) was specially commissioned
by Tolkin, and a portion of the
proceeds will go to the Bridge
School in San Francisco, the

most important songs of my life is
‘Winterlong.’ I woke up every
day for a year listening to that
song.”

Deciding who would play what
Neil Young song was, Tolkin
says, “a feat of coordination.
Several bands wanted to do songs
that other bands also wanted to
do." It was a matter of me deciding

But the king of cover albums is
Alan Duffy, who runs the

Ice—T preaches street—Wise realism

Probably best known for per-
forming the title track to Dennis
Hopper’s controversial Colors,
Ice-T combines his street smarts
with _a realistic outlook, giving
his music an aggressive and often
very brutal tone. Though he has
often been criticized for his por-
trayal of violence, Ice—T insists
that his lyrics represent life on the
street.

Ice-T is a former gang member
who is now a successful musi-
cian, and his list of credits in-
cludes a part in the movie Breakin ’
and a full-length LP entitled I'm

-f .

Your Pusher.

In December of 1988, Ice-T
was interviewed at WPTS before
his show here in the Pittsburgh
area. Jonathan Robinson, Byron
Allen, Jason Ogrosky and Chris
Kerser were the individuals re-
sponsible for the questioning.

Q: There are a lot of messages
that you send out in your music,
such as anti-drugs and what not.
Where do those messages come

from? A

has some sort of conscience to it
If you take time out to listen and
analyze the record, all of my stuff
is positive. It might be twisted to
some people, but I don’t tell
people to do drugs or to go out

and personally hurt somebody. I u

just deal with life.
I’m a realist. The violence that

0 people see in my records is just a

reflection of what’s really going
on, how I live, and how I have
lived in the past.

Q: Talking about the past, I
understand that you used to be a
gang member. If that’s true, then

  We|¢0meBuck, Slut!

 

how did you break out of that
and into the music industry?
A: Well, when living in Los
'Angeles, it's practically impos-
sible not to be in a gang. If you
live in the south-central area of
the avenues, all the streets in the
city are controlled by gangs. And
when I got to Crenshaw High
School, the whole school was
being controlled by one particu-
lar gang. So I was affiliated heav-
ily with this gang.

I was never a hard-core mem-
ber. A hard-core member is

and gang members, because
they’re not going to talk to you.

 So they have an FBI check

done on me before they allow
me to come in and talk to the
schools. So the FBI calls up
Warner Bros. and said, “We have
Ice-T’s record here called I’m
YourPusher. Do you think that's
appropriate to youth and ele-
mentary school students?" And
Warner Bros. said, “Have you
“Well,
we don’t have a turntable at the
bureau.”

You know, so they need to just
shut the f-ck up really. Because
they’re obviously dumb motherf-
ckers over there at the FBI. But
that’s just basically how it is.
People that don’t understand the

, music always try to grade it. We

just ‘leave them alone; we know
what time it is. Those people
probably watch Hulk Hogan and
then go out and vote.

Q: Do you feel that the govern-
ment’s drug policies are doing a
suﬂicientjoh?

A: No, that’s bullsh-tl The gov-
ernment’s drug policy is basically
to put it on TV, make it look like
we’re doin’ something. Cocaine
really isn’t manufactured in
America, but yet they’ll move the

Q‘ National ‘Guard on the streets of
Los Angeles and kill up the black‘

kids that are out there sellin’ it.
But the black kids aren’t really
the problem; these kids are just
capitalists. They were the perfect
pawns to push drugs. But they’re
just paper boys. You’ve got to go
get-the publisher.

Instead of moving the military
into my neighborhood, why don’t
you move it into Colombia? Why
don’t you move it into South
America? You could shut off drugs
atthe source. There’s absolutely
no way you’re going to shut it off
in the streets. It’s impossible to

hood, the cops get a raise. They
get to run the gang sweeps and
they get four million bucks. So
these cops get a raise and they
get to go out and buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.

Now if you end the gang vio-
lence and end the crime, the cops
get laid off. It’s economics, man!

Q: AﬂerColors, there was con-
troversy over the violence in your
song. So how do you explain the
depiction of violence, lilee when
you have a gun on the cover of
your album?

A: The reason I had guns on
the cover is because I try to
attract the negative kid. I’m after
the class of kids that nobody else
wants to mess with. I’m after the
stick—up kids, the kids that might
go out and rob or murder some-
body. That’s my audience; that’s
who I’m concerned with.

Now if you, a college student,
can tell me a better way to get a
negative kid to pick up an album
than a gun, then please tell me
now. Butl can’t stand on the
album cover with a peace sym-
bol and some ﬂowers; they just
will not buy the album. 9

It’s kind of like on the heavy-
metal’ albums: you show lots of
the ﬁve-‘pointed stars and priests
with their heads cut off, because
that's the way the rock ‘n’ rollers
can be hard—core. It’s not them
saying that they’ re devil worship-
pers, it’s just hard—core to white

kids who see that.

You show that album to a black
kid and he’d be like, “Ahhhhh!
Spooks, I’m scared!” That ain’t
hard—core to us, that's scary. But
what’s hard—core to us is a gun,
because we’re from different

backgrounds. That’s what draws
them in. I use that hook and then
1 tap their mind with some knowl-
edge.

I can’t think of a better way to
get a brother from the street than
with a gun and a girl in a bathing

suit. If they don’t like guns, then‘

they have -to like women. If they
don’t like women, then don’t buy
my record, ‘cause I don’t wanna
meet ‘em, and I definitely don’t
want ‘em at my concert!

Showcase Editor

Reminiscent of the enchanted,
heavily—inked character in Ray
Bradbury’s The Illustrated Man,

.Bob Rutter hunches over his

tattoo-covered arms in his

Bodyworks Tattoo Studio, located

in Penn‘Hills_. The tattoo gun in
his right hand chatters to life as
he begins injecting ink into the
young man’s skin. His delicate
hand movements quickly create
the image of a multicolored
spider. ’ '

The walls in the back room of .

the A studio are covered with
pictures of tattoo—covered bodies,
autographed panties from females
who have consented to go under

the gun,»and a single sign with _

the essence of tattooing. It reads:
“The only difference between
tattooed people and non—tattooed
people is that tattooed people
don’t care if you’re not tattooed.”

His bushy, gray-white beard

- .and ponytail, Harley T-shirt,

numerous earrings (stereotypical
“biker” regalia), and even his
missing two front teeth are
deceiving. These traits seem like

Ia veil of toughness to ward off
,0 fakes and let only truly open-
iminded

individuals meet the
deeply skilled artist that is

' embodied within his large frame.

Known as Moose by his patrons
and friends (he was tagged with
the nickname while stomping
around the high school football
field), he fell into the art of
tattooing while attending the Pratt
Art Institute in New York.

“My roommate’s father was a

tattoo artist in Long Island,” says
Moose in his restrained, gruff
voice. “One thing lead to another,
and I started working with him
for a while. I first played around
with it in 1970, when I graduated
from college. Professionally, I've

been doing it since 1975.” I

THE {PITT NEWS, Monday, August 23, 1989

The ancient art of tattooing has
been dated back to almost 6,000
B.C., when it was used to denote
social status, in much the same
way that clothes and other
material possessions are viewed
today. I I

would attribute a lot to that.

“As far as the business is
concerned,” he continues, “I’ve
been tattooing for 17 years, and
I've always had people in and out
of the shop. There’s always one
-part of the community that wants
to be different from the others.”

While the acceptance of tattoos
has ﬂuctuated over time, the
techniques and forms of tattooing
have made marked improvements »
over the last 100 years. The earliest
tattoos were applied with a
sharpened piece of bamboo or
wood that was dipped in pigment
(derived from plants and ash)
and then tapped into the skin
with a small mallet.

The discovery of electricity led
to the tattoo gun. Though it has
changed little since its fabrication

A almost 30 years ago, it has been
fine tuned into a precision
instrument.

Even the colors, Once limited
to red, green and blue, have been
expanded to a panorama of hues.
They have also become more
durable than their predecessors,

which tended to fadenoticeably
over time.

The sanitary aspects of tattooing .

have also greatly improved.
Infection was common in the
past, and contracting hepatitis
was also a concern. And today,
with the advent of AIDS, the
question has been raised whether
this and other diseases carried in

the blood can be transmitted
through tattooing.

“Not if it’s done properly,” says
Moose adamantly. “Everything is
sterilized. They use ultrasonic

cleaning and autoclaves. All
material is discarded after the
tattoo is done. You prepare the
skin like a surgeon would. You
shave it, clean it off real good,
and then the design is put on the

skin.”

And there’s always the question
of pain. Everyone wants to know
how badly it hurts. “Hurts like a
bitch,” Moose guffaws. “I can’t
wait to get my next one.” In a
more serious tone, he says, “They
do hurt a little bit, but the pain is
secondary. If you want it bad
enough, the pain doesn’t matter.”

For such an exotic, antiquated
art form to be practically shunned
by the more “acceptable” art
circles is unfortunate. Tattooing
utilizes brilliant colors, intricate
designs and a unique canvas, the
human body, but you won’t find
any examples of it in any
museums.

“The ‘fine art community’ will

never accept tattooing because it
can’t ﬁnd a way to frame it and
hang it," says Moose. “We don't
hang our art, we wear it. Tattooing
is a viable art form. It’s probably
one of the oldest art forms known
to man. They were ‘ probably
doing tattooing before they were
doing rock paintings.”

There is one consistent factor
in tattooing; the artists are serious
about their work, and the
recipients of tattoos are proud of
their ink and the way it personifies
them. Finding an artist whose
work you appreciate and relate
to is very important.

“Shop around. If you want a
good piece of artwork, you need

‘>f.

THE Pm NEWS, Monday, August 28, 1989

to have a good artist do it,” says
Moose. “I would suggest that
people go in and check out a
person’s work before they let
anyone touch them. Ask around,
and ﬁnd out where you can get a
good tattoo.”

It may not be the most socially

V

acceptable practice yet, but
growing public awareness and
acceptance may soon bring
tattooing a respectable spot
among the arts. The beauty and
complexity of any tattoo is limited
only by the boundaries of the
human imagination.

Roses.)

Pittsburgh,” offers a little rock, a
little blues and a lot of city locals.

know to show up there.

Discover a new World at Sign of Aquarius

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Imagine you’re sitting at a bar,
and this ’70s throw-back with
gold chains and a jungle for chest
hair comes up to you and hands
you the line, “Hey baby, what’s
your sign?”

You answer, “I don’t know, I

think I’m an Aquarius."
“Wow!” he says. “You’re a wild
one. You and I are going to

groove along real line.” Then he
oozes down into the stool beside
you and begins drooling on your
brand new pair of paisley bell-
bottoms.

Then, the John Travolta

wanna-be tells you that he is a
very sensitive Cancerian who is
looking for someone to take care
of him.

Even though you’re not too
adept with this astrology stuff,
you know this guy is anything
but the sensitive type. You wish
you had read just a little more

about what a Cancerian actually
Was. Then you could tell this guy
to blow.

Well fear not; there is a
bookstore in Shadyside which
can help you with all of your
astrological and spiritual needs,
and it's called The Sign of
Aquarius.

Located on Copeland Street, it
would be easy to miss if not for
the stunning, purple trim on the
outside. Upon entering you can
easily see that it is a small store
overcrowded with books.

The name was not chosen
because the owner is an Aquarian
(even though she is), butbecause
the world has astrologically

More Soundings 

Cntinued from page D-5

with each greater decibel comes
a more intense sound of mess ages
hidden in metaphors.

Unlike the Cure’s previous
albums, Disintegration pumps
out a mature sample of new-
wave music. The songs not only
have more serious themes,
basically centering around the
turmoil in relationships, but the
music also has quite an array of
background harmonies.

“Pictures of you” is one of the

“best examples of the Cure’s more
sophisticated breakthrough. The
music goes beyond the basic

drums, guitars and vocals. The A

sounds of glass wind chimes
create a certain sense of
tranquility, with clarity and
crispness. The lyrics deal with
the “disintegration” of a
relationship and bring out the

.) deeper sense of assurance and

compassion within the band.
Of course, as with all Cure
albums, there is an equilibrium
of warmth with humor. “Lullaby”
elicits the capacity to perceive
the amusing through suggestive
allusions to Spiderman.
In contrast to past albums,
Disjntegrations melodies have
slowed down considerably. The
rhythm and dance section of the
album belongs to the ever-
popular “Love Song.” Anyone
who is in love or has been in love
will thoroughly appreciate this
-tune. The upbeat rhythm is
accompanied by words filled with
freshness of spirit and affection.
“Fascination Street,” on the
other hand, gets progressively
harder and faster, capturing the
intensity of Smith’s authoritative
commands.
The title of the album leaves
one question to contemplate: Is it

, a foreshadowing of the future of

Rbert Smith of the Cure.

 Stevie Nicks
The Other Side of the Minor
Modern/Atlantic

After being in wonderland for
I a time, Stevie Nicks has a new
album out called The Other Side
of the Mirror.

The Gypsy—witch queen isback,
with her gritty voice and lyrics of
magic, men and mystery.

In the Alice persona (one that
seems to be popular with many
female artists these days), Nicks
delivers a wonderlandlike album
with the help of producer/
keyboardist Rupert Hine and
saxophone player Kenny G.

Sure, there are some slow
syrupy songs like “I Still Miss
Someone,” written by Johnny
Cash, and “Two Kinds of Love,”
both of which are the type of
songs that make you feel really
sad and sort of morose.

However, the lady really shines
with her harder tracks “Long Way
to Go” and “Doing the Best I
Can.” These are the songs that

 
  

  

Bad Company

So often judgements about people are based upon
the company they keep. A person in ”bad company”
is a bad person. A person keeping ”good company”
is a good person. It’ s that simple. Do you know that
Jesus is accepted or rejected based more on people's
opinions of his companions or followers, rather than
being based on his own character? It does not matter
that Jesus was kind, loving, just, fair, or honest in his
dealings with others.

The Scribes and Pharisees of his day as well as
other "good” people rejected him and his messianic
claims because of his associates. Seen in the com-
panyof prostitutes and other sinners, he was sum-
marily rejected. Today it is no different.

Many students who say they seek the Truth dis-
miss Christianity based rnore on those sinners who
follow Christ than on the basis of the person of Christ
himself. In other words, they don't go to Church be-
cause of all the hypocrites who do go. It could be
that those people in church know they are sinners
and know they need Christ.

It is a fact that many Christians, though they all
follow Jesus, don't necessarily agree with all the atti-
tudes and actions of their fellow Christians. Chris-
tians are people too. They are each different in per-
sonality, temperament and behavior. They are not
all cast from the same mold. You may reject Christ
because you reject a certain ”type” of Christian.
That’ 5 too bad. Jesus Christ, the most important
human being to ever live, has come as Savior to this
world. The honest seeker of Truth must accept or re-
ject HIM, not those with whom he keeps company.

There was a prostitute, who met Jesus at a well.
She went back to tell the people of the town. They
listened and went to see him for themselves. How
simple. The "good news” of Christ came through
this sinful woman. Instead of dismissing her and
therefore, dismissing Jesus,they went out and met
Jesus themselves. Company - good or bad - does not
lessen the reality of Jesus Christ. If he is not God, re-
ject him. If he is God, follow him.

The following is a monologue
taken from HeniyRollins’ “Spoleen
Word Tour, " which he performed
at l the Sonic Temple in
Wilkinsburg on Aug. 13. Be
advised that what may appear to
be "racial slurs in his story are
simply Rollins’ way of
exaggerating social stereotypes.

I didn't sleep at all last night,
except for about 40 minutes, just
because I had a lot of stuff to do;
so by this morning, I was
hallucinating. I thought that there
was an earthquake going on in
this house I was in, and by the
time I got to Los Angeles
International, I was seeing sh-t
on people's faces.

I was getting on this plane that
was going to Pennsylvania, so
there's all these kind of oakie-
looking people getting on the
plane. And there was this whole
.clan of inbred, people. They

looked like three sisters; these
women were all identical with
these really insane, ﬂat faces.

One of the more mutated
women had this mutant child.
And they’re all just standing
around, and it took them, like,
half an hour to understand that to
sit on the plane they needed
tickets.

And they had on these intense
outﬁts, like J.C. Penney’s stretch
clothing from '71. And then they
got on the airplane.

I was all the way in the back in
the smoking section. There was

this cloud of smoke. And these ~

three women were wearing these
ankle—length skirts, like a
Mormon-type thing, and they all
had changed into their Saturday-
night get—down clothes. They
were all in these bad J.C. Penney
jeans and had really horrible tops
on. And they’re just kind of
standing transfixed by the little

porthole window by the back.

They were all kind of crowding
for space for like half an hour,
and they had the kid. And the kid
is, like, breathing in all the
cigarette smoke and just looking
out the little porthole window
like it was this amazing television
show. And all their hips were,
like, right next to my head, so I
had to endure these mutants for
this whole,‘long plane flight.

So we just got off the plane
about 45 minutes ago, so it’s
good to be off, and it’s good to be
here.

I wanted to read you this thing.
I was in Europe a couple of
months recently, on a talking
tour, and Sounds magazine asked
me to write an article for them. I
said, “What about?” And they
said, “Just write an article, do
what you want.”

So I wrote this thing about...
Remember when Peter Gabriel

SPOKEN
WORD

I and Sting and Bruce Springsteen

and all those people were hogging
all those stages all around the
world and going like, “We care!
We care!”? And then they'd get
back in the first class section of
the chartered 747 and jet off to
“care” somewhere else.

Well, someone mader’a lot of
money off of that, and I'm sure all
those dudes got their bankrolls
padded by at least a million each.
So I thought it was a bunch of
bullsh-t. So I wrote this little thing
about it. You’ll probably
recognize some of the names and
some of the phrases:

Dateline: Beverly Hills, Ca. It
had been a slow morning at
Megafake Inc. The head honchos
wept. Sting called out, “Bono, do
that one again about stealing the
song back from Charles Manson.
I do so much love that one.”

“Right,” cried Bono,

brimming with tears. He
proceeded to jump up on the
conference table. And he
delivered the lines.

“Bravo,” said Sting, and
clapped. ’

Bruce looked up from the floor,
a long string of saliva swinging
from his mouth. He looked
around. His glazed eyes found
Bono kneeling on the table.
Bruce’s face contorted into a
mask, twisted and joyful, full of
surprise. “Ahhhhh! Ehhhhh!”

Bono giggled and looked over
at Sting. They both grinned and
silently mouthed “the Boss” at
each other and then broke into
peals of laughter.

When they had regained
control, they just sat and stared at
“the Boss.”

Sting got on the phone and
called out to the receptionist.

Mr. Springsteen. And Peter, do
tell that woman to be careful. The
last pot of coffee she brought in
was too black. Too strong. That
will be all.”

A few minutes later there was
a barely audible knock at the
door. “Come in,” chimed Sting
and Bono.

The door opened and a young
black women entered, pushing a
gleaming silver coffee service.

“Did you bring the towel,
T racy?” asked Sting.

“Yesah mastah, I be bringing
that towel just as sure as the day
is long, the water is wet and the
possum...”

“Oh, shut up!” snapped Sting.

Tracy fell silent and stared at
the floor. Slowly she moved
forward and started pouring the
coffee. Sting patted her on the
head.

“Ah! For good luck,” said Bono,
and then broke into peals of
tittering laughter.

“Tracy. Wipe up Mr.
Springsteen and get out, " ordered
Sting.

“Yesah massah, ” replied Tracy.
“I be wiping dat drool from
massah Springsteen’s face just as
sure as the day is long, water is
wet and...”

“Shut up!” screamed Sting,
pointing to a birch rod leaning
against the jacuzzi, “Or I’ll bring
on the night.”

Tracy slowly pushed the cart
toward the door, muttering under
her breath. “Sure enough ain’t
nothin’ like dat sun.”

The phone rang. Bono and
Sting lunged forward, Sting edging
out Bono by inches.

“Yes,” exclaimed Sting into the
receiver, his voice drenched with
emotion and global concern. “Yes.
Yes, we'll be right there. Don’t
worry. Yes, yes.”

He hung up, and Bono looked
at him. “Is it?”

“Yes, it is. A cause."

They both began jumping up
and down, yelling, “A cause, a
cause. Hooray, a cause!”

The Boss looked up, a new
string of drool swinging madly
from l1is lip. ,_

“By the way,” queried Bono,
“what is the cause?”

“Across town,” said Sting
gravely, “a cat, caught in a tree.”

“Right,” screamed Bono, eyes
brimming.

Sting called reception. “Peter,

up artists and T—shirt designers in

yet another release in their
colossal string of musical
adventures.

Brain Drain is no exception to
the band’s mainstay of boisterous,

i fuzzy guitars, slamming rhythms

and snot—caked, frenzied vocals,
which coagulate to form
something vaguely reminiscent
of hard-driving rock ‘n’ roll.

Of course, these New York

hoodlums occasionally venture "

from the straight and narrow to
croon about love, but these
departures are brief, and they
quickly careen back to their
shelter of insanity.

Brain Drain is proof that it's not
the end of the Ramones, and it
clearly shows that..they...won’t
compromise their silly, morbid
style for anyone or anything.
“Pet Sematary,” the title track to
Stephen Kin g’s grisly horror ﬂick,
perfectly caters to the Ramones.

We Are Happy To Serve You
Homestead

New York’s all right if you like V

saxophones. Or other jazzmatazz
kinda things. For some reason or
other, that treasure trove of talent
called Loisada just keeps spewing

out endless numbers of constantly .

interchangeable avant ensembles.
And most of them are fairly
excellent.

Fish and Roses are one of those
ensembles. Their first EP came
out on Lost Records, home of
eclectic squonk-rock groups. But
Fish and Roses aren’t as blatantly
political as Mofungo, as bump-
noisy as Better Than Death, or
even as pop structured as The
Scene Is Now. Instead, they
possess a more homey, poetic
feel that carries over to their new
LP on Homestead.

songs sans hippie intentions. Also,
the dulcet voice of Sue Garner is
a pleasant change from the yelling
that often accompanies other New
York noise, though drummer Rick
Brown’s voice is gruffer on songs
like the triplet-time “Emergency
Exit.”

Of note are the extended
wailing jam called “Rockwave,”
and a rockish anthem entitled
“Stand Fast, Bo Diddley,” featuring
the chunky guitar of Ira Kaplan
from Yo La Tengo. Fish and Roses
sidle closer to the melodious honk
of the Ordinaires or Soldier String
Quartet on the long piece
“Raisins.” The best simple lyrics
are sung by Brown on “Raisin
Jack” (unrelated to the previously
mentioned song), in which he
speaks for a defendant: “My man
in prisonis not allowed/Raisins
and raisin bread because/They
think he might make wine.”

The raisin motif goes one step
further. Raisins are sweet and fun
to eat; Fish and Roses are nice
and fun to listen to, without any
heavy highbrow tendencies to
weigh them down. One could
say they are “nice” in the same
way that Beat Happening is nice,

The End of the Innocence
Geffen Records

Maybe the Eagles haven’tbeen

heard from in a decade, but former :

drummer Don Henley has been
alive and well in the 1980s,
churning out hits like “Dirty

Laundry,” “All She Wants to Do is _-
Dance" and, of course, “The Boys I ‘
of Summer.” But -for every one of .
his hits, there have been eight or -
nine songs on each of his albums ‘
that have been virtually ignored  '

by popular radio.

Henley’s latest release, 7beEnd ‘
of the Innocence, may change i

that. Henley varies his styles, from
ballads to all—out rockers to songs

that one could easily dance to. '

Eight of the 10 numbers on this
release stand out in their own

way, and a myriad of guest ;

performers lend handily to the
overall project.

Five of the tunes here have hit
appeal, and two — “The End of
the Innocence" and “I Will Not
Go Quietly” — have already
become hits. Bruce Hornsby
guests on the title track, his soft
piano laying the groundwork for
rough vocals by Henley that
lament the end of one phase of

life. Axl Rose of Guns ‘n’ Roses ,

backs Henley on “I Will Not Go
Quietly,” his voice a sheer wall of
sound as unmistakable as

 

Henley’s, and the heavy metal
tinge he adds couldn’t mix better
with the heavy drums and guitars
of the song.

“New York Minute,” a sad song
about the uncertainty of life,
certainly owes something to the
intro to BillyJoel’s “The Stranger,”
with its light piano and a touch of
horns here and there. The light,
jazzy sound makes it easy to put
your feet up to this one, maybe
even fall asleep, but the lyrics
stay with you, and the music
turns out to be rather haunting as
well.

Henley uses a reggae beat on
“Little Tin God” to back a
wonderful song about the
evangelists who have made the
news lately, and “If Dirt Were
