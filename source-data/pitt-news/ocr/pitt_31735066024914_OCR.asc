UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Over 50,000 African
Americans in the United States
have AIDS and at least 4 - 10
times more are infected with
the HIV virus, according to
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force
educator Shari Morris.

“There are all kinds of theories
about where HIV came from,”
said Morris, who spoke in the
William Pitt Union last night.
“We, as African Americans, are
being affected by the virus at a
disproportionate rate, and it
doesn’t matter where it came
from.”

About half of the people
attending the lecture raised their
hands when Morris asked if
anyone knew someone infected
with HIV. One person said she,
herself, was infected with the
virus.

Morris. said in order to be
diagnosed with AIDS, a person
must have one or more
opportunistic infections, which
most of use have been exposed

Author and psychologist Dr. Francis Cress
Welsing said that racism originates from a
fear of white genetic annihilation by the
black male during her lecture last week in
the William Pitt Union’. I .

Welsing, author of The Isz‘sPapers‘,_ defined

racism as “the system in which peopleyvho
classify themselves as white dominate those
they classify as non-white.”
«A Welsing said the system's origin began
during Columbus’ trip to America. “Every
place the boat landed, there were colored
people.”

As breeding between the races occurred,

so did the realization that non-white was
genetically dominant in terms of skin color.
Welsing said thatwith nine—tenths of today’s
world’ population being of color, whites
still carry the same fear instilled as early as
1492. She said her knowledge of this has
made her more tolerable of white-
supremacist society.

“No problem; I understand- I have
dec_odecl_ what the fear is. This is what
white supremacy and apartheid is all about,”
she said.

Welsing gave the audience blackboard
diagrams to coincide with the lecture.

“This is what it’s all about,” she said, as
she drew an outline of black, male genitalia
on the board and defined it as “the great

annihilator.”

Welsing said the white race was forced to
create a weapon against this annihilator —-
the gun, shaped much like male genitalia
and named “the great equalizer." .

Welsing said she understands other
defense systems built from the fear ofwhite
society, including lynching, castrations,
cross burning, anti-Semitism and the need
to call blacks a minority.

She said a white, male police officer can
kill an unarmed black male and get off on
justifiable homicide because the black male
was “armed with the great genetic
annihilator.”

Welsing said she is even able to

which are wholly owned
subsidiaries of the university, in
this country.

The trip drew criticism when
the l’0sl—Gazette reported that it
would cost S5(),()()() to fly 12
members of the insurance
companies’ Board of 'l'rustees to
the meeting.

The insurance companies were
established in 1976 when Pitt was
dropped by its private insurer.

Attorney Wilbur McCoy Otto,
who represents the companies,
said the companies have saved
Pitt 850 million in insurance
premiums over the last 16 years.

Folk singerjoins effort to close toxic waste incinerator

By Gary Knapick
Senior Staff W/riter

Forty years ago, Pete Seeger penned “If
I Had a Hammer," a song that Peter, Paul
and Mary would elevate to the status ofa
folk anthem during the peace movement
of the ’60s. Earlier in that decade, Seeger
taught civil-rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr. to sing “We Shall Overcome,” a
song that would become synonymous
with the struggle for racial equality.

Last Saturday, Seeger again lent his
talents to the cause of battling social
injustice, as he performed with guitarist
Randy l-larris at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall for the benefit of Pittsburgh
Against Toxic Incineration.

Pittsburgh Against Toxic Incineration is
one of many grassroots organizations
fighting the construction of Waste
Technologies industries” to.\ic-waste
incinerator in l-last l.i\*Crp(>t>l, (,)hio, a small
town situated on the Ohio border :30 miles

west of Pittsburgh. Opponents of the
incinerator argue that the facility’s release
of heavy metals, dioxins and furans will
wreak havoc on the ecology and health of
East Liverpool and western Pennsylvania.

“It looks like a cheap way to get rid of
[toxics]  at first glance,” Seeger said.

Longtime anti—incineration advocate and
chemistry Professor Paul Connett served
as master of ceremonies for the event.

“This man was singing for justice and
against oppression in the forties, in the
fifties, in the sixties, in the seventies, in the
eighties, and now here he is, once again,
in 1992,” Connett said.

“If there’s a human race one hundred
years from now, it’ll be because people
said, ‘Well, maybe I can’t do everything,
but I’ll do what I can,” Seeger said. “In
every corner of the world, there’ll be
people doing things.”

“There are five billion people on this
earth, and they all have slightly different
priorities. But after a while we find that

many of those priorities overlap, and it
becomes a matter of ‘Will there be a
human race in a hundred years?” Seeger
said.

Seeger joined the fight against the
incinerator because of his “admiration for
what Dr. Connett is doing,” Seeger said.
“Most chemistry professors know what's
going on Iin the chemical industry] but just
continue to teach. Dr. Connett takes time
off from his schedule and helps these
people.”

During the intermission, Connett
delivered an abbreviated argument against
the incinerator.

Connett, who has compared toxic-waste
incinerators to “landfills in the sky," said
the East Liverpool facility will be the
nation’s largest toxic-waste incinerator.

“Arrogance is ignorance backed up by
overconfidence. |\V’Tl’s incinerator! is a
monument to man's arrogance,” (,onnett
said.

“The reason I know that \\”l'l is based on

ignorance is because I’ve challenged them,”
said Connett, who claims that WT] officials
and scientists who claim that incineration
is safe have consistently refused to meet
with him to “have it out, scientific blow
after scientific blow.” At one scheduled
public debate where WT] officials did not
show up, Connett debated a rubber
chicken, which he now ca rries with him as
a symbol of the wastc~management
company.

Connett was particularly angered by the
fact that there are residences a few hundred
feet away from the incinerator and that an
elementary school is built on a hillside
1,100 feet away from the facility.

“There is no failsafe. Any human error,
mechanical error or electrical error will
have an immediate impact,” Connett said.

According to Connett, a “teeny-weeny”
mishap already occurred when a gas-line
ruptured at the facility. “Children at the
elementaryschool were evacuated. Some

Phi Gamma Delta I’raternity’s
house was evacuated Saturday
due to a fire caused by a light
bulb touching clothes in a
bedroom closet.

(lhris l.apos, president of l"lJl,
said, were pretty lucky. The
fire spread pretty quickly."

The ‘residents smelled the
smoke before the fire’ alarms went
off and then initially tried torput
the fire out themselves.

“We tried to put it out using a
couple of fire extinguishers and a
couple of buckets of water, but it
was too big,” I.apos said. “We
called the fire department. About
six fire trucks showed up. I think
what happened was probably

house damaged by

four of us called the fire
department.”

The fire took place only an
hour before FIJI’s scheduled
graduate dinner. “We were pretty
shaken up. It spread very fast and
could have easily gutted the house
because it's old,” Lapos said.

Due to the incident, FIJI plans
on improving its fire—prevention
techniques.

“\X/e’re definite y going to beef
up our fire—protection techniques.
\X/e’re going to buy more fire

Pitt Greeks interact with honorary UCP members

By Heather Galires
Staff Writer

Pitt’s fraternities and .sororities met with
their honorary brothers and sisters from
ljriited Cerebral Palsy for a night of fun and
garries Iliursday in the William Pitt ljriion as
part of this year’.s (’in;:<;l< \Veek.

lirin Rodgers, a Ill(,‘.IIll)(_‘.f of Phi Kappa
Theta sorority, said, “\Ve'r‘(.- raising all this
money for them during (ircel/. Week, and
this event gives us an opportunity to see the
people that we're helping.”

l')an ltossi, the volunteer coordiriator of

l,’(LP, said this event is important to the
participants.

“Most evenings there is very little going on.
It's just a real nice way for [clients] to get out
into mainstream society and connect with
people who care about them who are not
paid staff," Rossi said.

He added that the clients need to interact
with people their own age.

“Most of the participants are real eager.
Most are hc-ad-injured, between 20 and 30
years old and are interested in meeting
people their age. 'l'hey like the connection
with society,” ltossi said.

Daphne Shirk, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s
honorary sister, said, “Meeting people I don’t
know is very important to me.” Shirk was hit
by a bus and has had eight brain operations.

Lisa Almond of Kappa Delta said the event
was a nice idea.

“It enables us to realize you can’t take
things for granted and that everyone’s special.
People do care,” Almond said.

Staci Safady, the Greek Week Volunteer
co—chair, said the event was important.
“'l'hey’ve never had anything like this before;
I think it’s really good. The participants enjoy

it, and the houses enjoy it,” Safady said.

Fabian Ardila of Phi Delta Theta said,
“Coming together with fellow Greeks made
me realize. our values are high and that the
Greek system stands for more than just
parties. It also stands for community and
caring,” Ardila said.

Deaf awareness day a ‘success’

 

By Kim Palrniero
Staff Wﬁter

Guest speakers and
technological demonstrations
were featured at the ninth annual
Deaf Awareness Fair sponsored
by Sign Connection last Friday in
the William Pitt ljnion.

Deaf business executive and
teacher Mitch Travers has learned
to speak clearly. l-le roused the
audience of children and adults
by addressing the importance of
sign language and raising the
awareness of the needs of the
disabled.

“Do you know how many
disabled people there are in the
United States today?” Travers
asked, as the crowd cl-.ieered.
“There are five million of us in
the lgnited States.”

The audience of 'l()() people,
was comprised ofschool children
from Pittsburgh to New York as
well as Pitt students and staff;

According to Karen Walkney, a
sign instructor who largely
organized the event this year, it
was a success.

“l think that this is the biggest
lturnoutl we’ve ever had,”
Walkney said. She attributed the
success to word of mouth and
better organization.

Highlights included‘ a
performance by the Pitt
cheerleaders, Miss Deaf Pittsburgh
Tina Fisher, a musical
performance by members of the
National Technical Institution for
the Deaf and the Mount Lebanon
Sign Language Club.

Members of the audience
helped the Mount Lebanon Sign
Language Club sign to Stevie

songs.

Pitt’s sign group, Beautiful
Hands, also performed, signing
to both old songs and new.

Volunteer organizations and Pitt
groups set up tables in the \X/PU
Assembly Room. Some of these
addressed various issues in the
deaf community. Over 20 tables
featured different groups,
including the Pitt Panthers, the
Office ofSpecial Student Services,
Delta Zeta Sorority and Registry
for Interpreters of the Deaf
Center.

Former Pitt student Doug
Taylor, who is partially deaf, has
attended the DeafAwareness Fair
for the past five years. He said
that some improvements could
be made at Pitt to better
accommodate the needs of the
deaf

“I ran into problems sometimes
when l couldn’t hear the fire
alarms. And also in class, I couldn’t
always hear the instructors.
Sometimes my grade suffered

because of this,” Taylor said.

Sabina Builder, who works at
the Office of Special Student
Services, added, “We would like
to see the acoustics improved in
the classrooms and have better
resources for note taking. We
also need some phones on
campus that are equipped for
deaf students.”

Builder pointed to a phone
created by AT&T. The: phone,
called a telecommunications
device for the deaf, is a telephone-
linked typewriter which allows
the deaf to communicate via a
keyboard.

Though the majority in
attendance were deaf, some
students who study American Sign
Language and are interested in
being involved in the deaf
community attended. Dan Bekish,
who is a second—year sign student,
said, “Its a really peaceful way to
communicate, and I think the
deaf community is a really
peaceful one.”

Seniors to register early

The first two days ofthe 1993 Spring term registration will be
reserved for seniors due to the Student Government Board’s
efforts to change the. current first-come, first—served policy,
announced SGB President till Golden at l-‘riday’s board meeting.

Golden said the. board initiated the action after many seniors
called during the last regisrtration period to express concern that
many classes were closed in the first days of registration.

tiolden met with atlministrators and through a series of
meetings came to the agreement that the first two days of
registration. Oct. 15 - 10, will be reserved for seniorregistration.
General registration will open on Oct. 19.

“This is to make sure seniors can get the classes they need,”
Golden said.

Ohio Valley, in which the
incinerator is built, is frequently
subjected to valley inversions.
Valley inversions are stagnations
of air created by valleys that
restrict normal air flow and trap
pollutants that would ordinarily
be allowed to dissipate.

“\X/e’re looking at opening the

Connett said. “It’s just a matter of

Senate’s anger misguided

Last Thurs_day, a reporter for,New York's Newsdczy put
himself in the position of contempt of congressional charges
for printing a story last fall.

It all began last October, when Senate hearings reopened
over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the United
States Supreme Court. During round one with the Senate
Judiciary Committee, the nominee ducked questions
regarding the controversies facing the Court. By the end of
September, his confirmation was almost guaranteed.

However round two erupted with allegations of sexual
misconduct while Thomas served as the head ofthe Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. Someone in the
Senate released critical information to the press concerning
sexual harassment between 'l'homas and former employee,
Professor Anita l lill.

As the story goes, Hill had gone to the committee with
her reservations. She charged sexual harassment but wanted
the information only to be shared with the Senatejudiciary
Committee. Of course, in our heated political climate,
someone or some group of individuals released information
to’l'imothy M. Phelps, a Ncwsday reporter, and to National
Public Radio’s ;\’ina Totenberg.

Upset with the release, Thomas’ supporters condemned
the leak and vowed to address the issue. And so the case
begins in earnest.

On I-‘eb. 15, a Senate special counsel began the witch-
hunt. Phelps, along with a senior Ncwsctayeditor, declined
to help the so—called investigation. Phelps endured /1 1/2
hours of questioning, ultimately asserting that the First
Amendment protects the press.

The investigation creates an interesting situation. A
journalist’s l-‘irst Amendment rights are pitted against the
Senate’s power to compel testimony during an
investigation. Warring claims involve issues at the
constitutional level.

As of now, the Supreme Court has not given a definitive
answer whether or not reporters must disclose confidential
sources to law-enforcement authorities. Some lower courts
have granted journalists exemption from disclosure.
'l‘wenty-eight states have enacted some protection for
journalists and their sources.

journalists, newspapers and the electronic media should
not be required to disclose sources to the Senate’s prying.

Without First Amendment protection ofthe press, media
in this country will be reduced to mere mouthpieces for
government proclamations. Print media put the necessary
check on the Congress, the presidency and every level of
government. I-‘orcing Phelps and 'l'otenberg to release
their sources will silence whistle~.blowers everywhere.

Contempt charges against Phelps will not solve the
Senate’s crisis. Congressional and presidential mud—slinging
are the real crimes.

We assert that Congress should back off and enact
“federal shield” legislation protecting journalists from the
advances ol'o\'er/.ealous politicians’ grandstanding. After
the Hill crucil'i.\'ion, the Senate should be hanging its
collective head in shame.

In desperation, Bush is
grabbing at straws for an
economic solution. _

For example, Bush recently
told the American public to help
“jump start” the economy by

Astonishing. .

Well, at least to President Bush it is. For the first
time in his lifetime he came across a phenomenon
that the rest of us call “scanners.” l-Ie called it
“amazing.”

It’s time for President Bush to wake up and smell ‘

the Maxwell House coffee.

But it’s not fair to say that Bush really partook in
an actual grocery-store ceremony. He actually
wimped out and went to the National Grocers’
Association convention in Atlanta. There they had
a model of the modern checkout counter. No line,
no wait, no National Enquireror snappy cashier for
Bush to deal with. It is impossible to imagine Bush
in a Giant liagle, anyway.

George Bush has no contact with the middle
class. For the past 12 years he has been living in
posh Washington mansions, sheltered from the
world around him. Ifhe has not been to a grocery
store, there probably are other places that he has
avoided.

In addition to not clipping coupons, Bush probably
was not fighting fora parking space — nor has he
been in one of the nation's deteriorating libraries.
I cannot say’ he experienced the yearly rises in
medical costs and college tuition, as well. However
he may fear the loss of his job in his recession.

buying a house or an American-
made car. In times that are as uncertain as these,
middle—class people usually feel insecure about
making such major purchases.

People are three paychecks away from the poverty
line. Plus, it is hard to buy anything nowadays with
everyone maxed out on credit.

Why doesn’t Bush buy something himself? He
certainly has enough money and security to do so.
I think he could set a greatexample and buy a giant,
gas-gu zzlin g Cadillac and pay the chauffeur himself,
instead of making the talxpayersﬂdoit. if in G 1

Better yet, he could buy a house in Texas.
Currently, he rents a hotel room in Houston and
declares it as his permanent residence, This way, he
does not have to pay any property taxes. In any
event, Texas does not have income taxes — so
Bush does not pay any state taxes. His vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine, is exempt from
any taxes since he is not a resident there. He pays
federal taxes, and that’s it.

Pretty sleazy, if you ask me.

We will see Bush trying to attack America’s
current social problems in the following months, as
he seeks re-election. He will try to reach out to the
middle class. He will try to empathize with
Americans’ problems.

Two weeks ago, he visited the model of a
supermarket check-out counter. Tomorrow, we
might see him confront a modern, pub1ic—transit
bus. Will he know how to read the signs? When to
pay? Where to go? i -

These same questions will be asked when he has
to stand in judgment for an economic mess he
helped ‘set in place 12 years ago.

Sealy-ing the victory

St. John’s dominates Pa

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

 

nthers firt Field Houselss

 

Perhaps St. John’s head coach Lou Carnesecca put it best; “It
was our night.”

Carnesecca’s team dominated Pitt at home Saturday night,
controlling the boards and the game in an 84-74 Big East victory.

The Panthers (15-10, 7-5 in league play) received a career
performance from senior guard Sean Miller, who scored 25
points. But the Redmen (14-7, 8-5) had four players in double
figures, with Malik Sealy’s 29 leading the way, .

It was the first loss for the Panthers at Fitzgerald Field House
this season. St. John’s is the only Big East team besides
Connecticut to beat the Panthers on their home court in two
years.

“They are the best team by far that we’ve played at the Field
House,” Miller said.

Even though the final margin of victory was 10 points, the
Redmen completely outclassed the Panthers throughout the
game. Nowhere was it more apparent than on the glass, where
St. John’s outrebounded Pitt 43-26. Paced by Shawnelle Scott’s
15 boards, the Redmen pulled- down 18 offensive rebounds; Pitt
grabbed only 16 defensive boards.

“We just couldn’t get it done [on the boardsl,” Pitt’s Chris
McNeal said. “We found ourselves out of position all night.”

Out of position was a good way to describe the performance
of the Panthers’ big men on Saturday. Darren Morningstar
continued to struggle and scored just four points in 21 minutes.
More importantly, he grabbed just two rebounds. Eric Mobley
was no better than Morningstar, garnering more fouls (four)
than points (two). ‘ ,

Aside from Miller, the only other offensive spark for Pitt was
first-year forward Chris Gant, who had a career high of 14 points .
before fouling out. Gant’ made seven of eight shots from the
floor and pulled down four offensive boards.

“He matched up well athletically," Pitt head coach Paul Evans
said. “He did what he could do, which is get inside and go to

the offensive glass.”

9 But career-highs from Miller and Gant were not enough to

Sealy dons blue-collar bat in 29-point inside 6j707"t

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Sports Writer

For most players it would be
a career night: 29 points, 10
rebounds, two blocks and two
assists in one of the Big East’s
most hostile arenas. But it was
nothing unusual for Malik Sealy.

“I just tried to play Malik Sealy’s
game,” he said. “I felt very well-
rested and confident tonight.”

The 6-foot, 8-inch senior from
the Bronx, N.Y., connected on

11 of 20 attempts from the floor
and seven of nine from the line,
but the most damaging statistic
was Sealy’s six offensive
rebounds, most of which he
converted into baskets. St. John’s
cruised to an 84-74 victory at
Fitzgerald Field House, Pitt’s first
loss there this year and only
their third in three seasons. Sealy
echoed the sentiments of his
coach, Louie Carnesecca, calling
this the biggest win of the season.

“It was our night,” Sealy said.

“I think it was important for our
confidence. Coach wanted us to
come out and punch the ball
inside to get some confidence.”

Sealy did his part in
hammering Pitt’s defenseless
interior. He is normally as silky
smooth as any player in the
nation, flashing along the
baseline and gliding through
the lane, personifying the phrase
“poetry in motion.” But Saturday,
the graceful one showed off his
blue-collar game, frustrating any

Panther defender who attempted
to stay with him and, as always,
lurking on the glass.
“[Rebounding has] really been
a big emphasis. Coach has been
stressing it at practice, and it's
starting to pay off,” Sealy said.
Pitt opened the contest with
first-year forward Orlando
Antigua guarding Sealy, but
Sealy’s seven points in the
Redmen’s 17-7 opening salvo
was enough to prove that he
would be too much. Sealy hit a

smooth jumper from the left
baseline, scored inside off the
glass, then displayed his wing
touch again. Panther rookie Chris
Gant had a couple of good
defensive stands, but Sealy was
relentless.

“Gant did the best job
defending him, and he struggled
at times,” Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said. “Sealy had a lot of
second shots; he rebounded well
and shot the ball well all night.”

Huemrich, Lady Panthers sweep series from Pirates

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

After two away games and two losses,
the Pitt Lady Panthers (9-14, 5-9 in the Big
East) returned home Saturday for a matchup
against Big East foe Seton Hall, now 12-11
overall, 4-10 in conference play. The
homecoming seemed to have been the
necessary cure for their recent slump, as
they emerged with a 62-59 victory and a
season sweep of the Pirates.

Sophomore forward Jonna Huemrich
continued to lead the young squad, pouring
in 25 points on 12-16 shooting from the
floor. With that total, she moved up to 15th
place on Pitt’s all-time scoring list,
surpassing Mimi Senkowski.

Pitt played tough, interior defense the
entire game, limiting forward Kelley Moore
to 12 points (all in the second half) and
center Dawn Johnson to four — the first

 

time she has been held to single digits
since becoming a starter halfway through
the conference season.

The contest was as close as themargin
to confirm Justice Clarence Thomas. The
largest lead enjoyed by the Lady Panthers
was nine points early in the first half, and
the Pirates never had a cushion larger than
four.

The game started out looking like a Pitt
runaway. After Seton Hall took a 4-1 lead
on a Kim Lee layup, the Lady Panthers
began an impressive 13-1 run, capped by
two Huemrich jumpers with just over 12
minutes remaining. The Pirates did not
crack the 10-point barrier until the 10:08

mark, when Becky Tingley hit a shot to put’

her team into double-digits.
Seton Hall, led” by forward Amanda
Makarewicz, began to whittle away the

lead by holding Pitt to seven points over.
a five-minute span while scoring 16 during’

that same time frame. The Pirates pulled
even for the first time at the 5:19 point,
when Makarewicz canned a jumper to
knot the game at 21. Jodi Brooks followed
with consecutive jumpers, giving the Hall
its largest lead of the game. However the
Lady Panthers closed the half with a 10-0
streak, giving them a 31-25 lead at the
break.

The second half proved to be even
closer than the first. After Pitt pulled out to
an eight-point, 37-29 advantage with just
under four minutes elapsed, the Pirates
again began tongradually chip away at the
lead, tieing the game for the second time
at 39 on a side with a Tara Stevens bucket.
They then equaled their largest lead of the
afternoon when a Veronica Sims layup
made it 45-41 with 9:17 to play.

However Pitt’s Carolyn Miller made a
layup, andJill McElhinny hit a jumper to tie
the score for the final time at 45. Carol

Morton put the Lady Panthers in front for
good with a layup off a steal, making the
score 47-45. The Lady Panthers needed a
Jill Colabrese three-pointer with 1:32 to
play to ice the game, putting them up by
six, 62-56. Seton Hall hit three free throws
in the last minute, providing for the final
score of 62-59. I

“This is the time of year where you want

to beat the teams that are around you in
the standings,” Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “It helps you to move up quicker
right now, and you can be in better
position for the tournament.”

Case in point: Entering Saturday's
competition, Pitt and Seton Hall were tied
for sixth place. The Lady Panthers’ win
moved them up to fifth.

One important statistic from Saturday's ,_

game came from the rebounding column.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 17, 1992

 

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports Writer

In Pitt’s 22-19 upset of Eastern
Wrestling League power Clarion,
the script was a familiar one.

Once again the Panthers found
themselves in a deep hole, and
climbing out against the nation’s
eighth-ranked team would be no
easy task.

At one point, Clarion led 196
but Pitt had the Golden Eagles
right Where they wanted them.

Pitt’s leaders, senior All-
Americans Perry Miller and Scott

Hovan, and red-hot junior Sean

Gibbs Continued to rise to the
occasion.

They again received a large bit
of assistance from sophomore
Jeff Kloiber (190), who kept Pitt
alive just as he did two weeks ago
against Bloomsburg.

'I'he jubilant Panthers savored
this weekend, but, as always,
kept looking ahead.

“It’s a real nice win. Just one
dual-meet, though, is all it  Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer

said.

“It’s nice to beat another Top
10. That will help our ranking.
But nobody wants this to be the
highlight of the season. We want
it to be a stepping stone to bigger
and better things.”

Those things are the EWL
Tournament, to be held here at
Fitzgerald Field House on March
6 and 7, and the NCAA
Championships in Oklahoma
City, March 20-21.

Pitt took added satisfaction from
the underdog role it assumed
leading into this match.

“Bloomsburg we were kind of
expected to beat, but these guys
I don’t think anybody expected
us to beat,” Kloiber said.

“That makes it that much
sweeter,” Miller added.

The only disappointment for a
raucous Fitzgerald Field House

crowd on Friday night was that I

the long-awaited showdown
between Miller and CIarion’s Kurt
Angle didn’t happen.

Angle was suffering from a bad
knee, and Clarion chose to replace

Wrestlers  Edinboro, Clarion

him with sophomore Rob
Sintobin. Stottlemyer and assistant
coach Jim Beichner were
convinced by the time the 158-
pound bout started that Angle
would not wrestle, but regardless,
the two titans remain on a collision
course.

“Somewhere down the line,
they’re gonna have to knock
heads, and we’ll see what
happens,” Stottlemyer said.

Clarion weighed in both of the

heavyweights, but Miller was not ’

sure of who he would see.

“Coach told me they might just .

be playing head games with you,”
Miller said.

“I had to be ready for Angle
until I saw Sintobin warming up."

Hovan (22-3) continued his
sensational season with a 4-3
decision over J. J. Stambro.

The always intense Hovan
wrestled a very patient bout, not
pressing despite a scoreless first
penod.

Trailing 1-0 entering the final
period, Hovan fired out from the
bottom position for a reversal

and scored the decisive takedown
with just over a minute remaining.

Gibbs notched his 20th win
against only five defeats with a 3-
1 decision Over Justin Kuzemka.

Like Hovan, Gibbs worked
patiently, finally getting a
takedown with :03 left in the
second period to go up 2-1.

He started the third period by
spinning out and away from

Kuzemka for an escape and the '

3-1 margin. —

Pitt narrowed its deﬁcit to 19-
12 at this point.

Kloiber began like a man
possessed, picking up Chris Shaw
and slamming him to the mat for
a takedown.

He quickly earned three more.
«points for a near fall and

threatened to end this bout early.

The period ended with Kloiber
up 9-0.

At times, Kloiber applied more
pressure, but Shaw appeared to
be stalling, and a pin was not to
be.

The boutended in-a 12-1 major
decision.

enthusiasm for us,” Stottlemyer
said.

The lower weight classes have
been a major weakness for Pitt all
season, and Friday night proved
to be no different.

At 118 Clarion senior Erik
Burnett (16-2-1) dominated Sam
Baker from the opening whistle,
scoring a 24-9 technical fall.

Pitt roared back at 126 behind
junior Bobby Simpson. Simpson
took charge of the bout early
with a takedown and near fall for
a 4-0 lead.

The remainder of the first period
was tight, with Simpson leading
Luke Shocklee 6-3 after one.
Simpson started the second period
on top and worked for two more
back points and an 8-3 lead.

The margin grew rapidly, as
Simpson scored another
takedown and worked Shocklee
over for four more back points.

Shocklee looked tired at this I

point, but Simpson did not let up,

pummeling Shocklee throughout

the final two minutes.
It appeared that a technical fall

was imminent with the score 20-

Game

Continued from page 7
offset the rest of the team’s
performance. .\'ot counting
those two players, Pitt
converted 13 of 55 shots
from the floor, a 43—percent
rate. Mc;\'eal scored eight
points on three-of-nine
shooting, .and Mobley and
Morningstar made three of
11 shots combined.

Meanwhile the Redmen
enjoyed a fine shooting
night, making 31 of 59 shots.
“When the shots are falling,
we look smart,” Carnesecca
said. “I thought our veterans
gave excellent
performances.”

Sealy, the 6—foot, 8-inch
senior, played all 40 minutes
and gave the Panthers fits
inside. Primarily a" silky
smooth wing player, Sealy
took just one three—pointer
and pulled down a game-
high of six offensive boards.

“Sealy just kept it going
all night,” McNeal said.

But Sealy was not alone.
Guard Chucky Sproling
scored 16 points, including
three three—pointers. Scott
andjason Buchanan added
15 each. Buchanan also
chipped in nine assists. “We
had good distribution in the
early part,” Sealy said. “We
got everybody involved.”

Four different players
scored for St. John’s in the
first four minutes, vaulting
the Redmen to a quick, 10-
point lead. From there, St.
john’s’ inside play and
transition game’-kept the ‘
lead in double figures for
most of the half. The
Panthers managed to bring
the margin within nine
points near the end of the
first period, but a Sproling
three—pointer made the
halftime lead 12 points, 47-‘
35.

MillerandGantledabrief
Pitt charge in the second
half, but the Panthers
couldn’t get the lead inside
10 points.

St. )ohn’s has only one
more Big East road game
remaining — at Providence
on Feb. 24. Saturday’s win
was the fourth in a row for
the Redmen. “We’ve

’ struggled,” Carnesecca said,
“but we’re seeing a little
light now.”

“They were awfully
tough,” Evans said. “They
are playing as well as
anybody in the Big East.
Their chemistry is really
good right now, with Scott
starting at center.”

U.S. boo/eey team just one of Olympic surprises

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Albertville Winter Olympics
are in full swing, and after a slow
start through the first week of
competition, the United States
Olympic Team has accumulated
six medals (three gold, two silver,
one bronze).

There have been many
surprises in these games of the
16th Winter Olympiad. The
biggest surprises came from the
upstart U.S. Hockey Team and
the inspiring performance of a
relatively unknown American
figure skater named Paul Wylie.

Paul Wylie just barely made it
onto the 1992 Olympic team,
overcoming his nearest
competitor for the last spot on the
team by one one-hundredth of a
point. The U.S. figure—skating
spotlight belonged to the reigning
U.S. champion, Christopher
Bowman, as well as the reigning
Olympic bronze medalist from
the 1988 Calgary games, Todd
Eldridge. No one expected Wylie
to steal the show. But after a

stellar performance in the first
part of the competition, Wylie
found himself in third place, well
ahead of both Bowman the
Showman and Eldridge. Ahead
of Wylie were Petr Barna of
Czechoslovakia in second place
and Viktor Petrenko of the Unified
team, who was leading the pack
after the first part of the men’s
figure—skating competition.
During the free competition on
Saturday, it seemed as if every
skater choked except for? Wylie.
Wylie turned in another knockout
performance, and the 27-year old
Harvard graduatewho almost
didn’t qualify for the team
suddenly found himself with a
silver medal around his neck.
Barna won the bronze medal,
and the gold went to Viktor

C Petrenko. Many critics believed

that the gold should have gone to
Wylie, but the experience and
reputation of Petrenko weighed
heavily on the judges’ scoring.
Another underdog with gold-
medal aspirations is the U. S.
Hockey Team, which shut out
Poland on Saturday, improving

its record to <'i—O and moving into
first place in its bracket. The

American team, consisting of two

former Penguins (Moe Mantha
and Scott Young), and a Penguin
drafte.e (Shawn Mcliache rn), plays
Sweden on i\lond_ay in a battle for
the top seed entering the medal
rounl). The unlikely hero of this
lI_S. team is goaltender Ray
l.eBl;inc, who already has two
shutouts under his belt and who
has given tip a total of four goals
in four games. Could we be
looking at another Miracle on Ice?
The performance of l.eBlanc and
the States’ defensive unit in the
single-elimination medal round
will tell the tale.

Other medal—winning
performances were given by
American downhill skier I-lilary
Lindh, who won a silver medal in
the women’s downhill — the best
finish for an American woman
since 1960 ‘— and Donna
Weinbrecht, who won the gold in
women’s freestyle moguls.

American speed skater Bonnie
Blair continued her Olympic
dominance, winning gold medals

in both the women’s 500-meter
and 1,000-meter. She became the
first American woman to ever
win back-to—back gold medals in
the same event. Blair won the
500—meter gold medal in the 1988
Calgary Winter Games.

Among the few letdowns in
this year’s games was the
disappointing performance of
Ainerican downhill skier A. J.
Kilt, who posted a lOth-place

finish in the downhill portion of '

the men’s combined and then
dropped out of the slalom run,
thus eliminating him from posting
a final score in the combined
event. The hopes and dreams of
the US. Ski Team were resting on
Kitt’s shoulders, and he finally
folded under the pressure.

The heartbreak story of the
Olympics so far is that of American
speed skater Dan Jansen, who
finished fourth in the men’s SO0-
rneter just weeks after breaking
the world speed record in that
very same eventjansen will have
his final chance for redemption
in the men’s 1,000-meter later
this week.

1 Q ' - « ' THE Prrr NEWS, Monday, February 17, 1992

Sealy

Continued from page 7
Sealy modestly deﬂected some
of the accolades to his teammates
when discussing his performance.
“No tricks —— guys found me
where I like to get the ball,” he
said. "A little bit of luck. Guys
found me in the right places. We
had good distribution. We didn’t
go to one guy too many times.”
Sealy showed off his
tremendous leaping ability, ﬂying
in for a one—handed slam to follow
Lamont Middleton’s miss and
build St. John's’ lead to 26-14. He
went airborne again on a slam
from Chucky Sproling and used
his quick legs to follow his own
miss, leaving Pitt dazed and
desperate, behind «til-29. He
collected 17’ of his points in the
first half. The opening of the
second stanza saw Sealy take it
inside for two more, giving St.
_lohn‘s its biggest lead, 4‘)—3S.
The move that was vintage
Sealy was his glide through the
paint and finger roll, which
resulted in a goaltending call
against liric .»\~lobley. Sealy
Continued to do most of his work

inside, but he took the time to
softly drop in an alley-oop feed
from Jason Buchanan with just
under 13 minutes remaining. At
that point, only the final score
was in doubt.

On a night where the Redmen
played without center Robert
Werdann for the 10th consecutive
time and first-year guard Derek
Brown (sprained ankle), Sealy
stepped forward further as a
leader. .

“l was trying to drive, stick the
shot when it was there and draw
fouls," Sealy said.

Last season against the
Panthers, Sealy poured in 35
points in St. }ohn‘s' 33-71 victory
at Alumni llall.

He scored 2? more at Fitzgerald
in a losing effort. But one thing
he couldn't do Saturday was
analyze his tremendous success
against Pitt.

‘'1 wish I knew. Then maybe I
could use that against some other
teams we play,” Sealy said.

“Sealy hurt us last year, and it
was just an instant replay this
year,“ Pitt guard Sean Miller said.

Continued from page 8
6, but Simpson’s persistence
resulted in a pin with :01
remaining in the bout.

“For him to get a six with
one second to go — that's a
real big momentum boost,"
Stottlemyer said.

Simpson stepped forward
on a night when Pitt
desperately needed a jumpstart
at the lower weights.
Stottlemyer felt Simpson's
performance was pivotal.

“We knew we had to keep it
close going into the last four
because we knew we had a
legitimate chance to win the

last four," Stottlemyer said.

First-year wrestler]. J. Fasnacht
dropped a 10-3 decision to junior
Steve Krouse, but this bout was
much closer than the score
indicated.

One of the more highly
anticipated matchups was at 142
with Clarion’s John Dasta, the
defending EWI. champ at 134,
against Steve Budman.

In the last five seconds of the
first, Dasta broke a scoreless
deadlock, hurling Budman to
the mat for a takedown.and a 4-
0 lead. The margin grew to 7-0
after the second period, and
Dasta wore Budman down in

the final period for an 8-0 major
decision.

Budman has struggled lately,
particularly in EWL matches.
Clarion led the match 12-6 and
applied further pressure when
Darin Roth defeated first-year.
manjoe Plouse 12-7 in the 150-
pound match. At 158 Scott
I-lenry earned another major
decision for the Golden Eagles,
knocking off john Palmer, 15-
S.

The win, coupled with a 19-
17 win at Edinboro Thursday
night, pushed Pitt’s record to 9-
5 and 4-2 in EWL action. Clarion
fell to 11-5 on the season.

AIDS

Continued from page I

to. Only those who have a
weakened immune system
become ill. Those who have HIV-
related illnesses get night sweats,
vomit and lose weight, although
they may have a perfectly healthy
appetite. Women who have AIDS
are often notdiagnosed with AIDS
but with HIV-related illnesses.

“Some people are exposed to
HIV and never become infected
with the virus,” Morris said.

She said blood, semen, vaginal
secretions and breast milk, which
all have high concentrations of
white blood cells, are the fluids
that can transmit the virus from
one person to another. Blood
and semen are responsible for
most cases.

She added that saliva, sweat
and urine do not present a threat.

She recommended the use of
Saran Wrap if performing oral
sex on a woman and the use of
:1 condom if performing oral sex
on :1 mm.
