Religious Poll Reveals
Moral Standards High,

Bulletin Board Jobs
Drop Color Clauses

The University Placement Bureau’s position on racial and
religious discrimination in job placement was outlined to-
day in a three-part statement by Assistant Dean of Men
Lester G. Brailey, acting head of the bureau.

First phase of the policy on discriminatory jobs is
that no stipulation of race, religion, or national origin
will be posted in bulletin board advertisements for part-
time or full-time jobs.

The placement ofﬁce will continue to accept job offers 

from employers who ask information on race or -religion.
But these discriminatory questions will not appear in bul-
letin board announcements. 0

Belief in God Positive

BY JACK MARKOWITZ

A campus poll on religious and moral questions reveal-
ed today that a large majority of students believe positively
in the existence of God, that half completely oppose pre-
marital sex relations, and that one-third believe that war
is ‘completely unjustiﬁable.

This ,tal_ly represents the answers of 117 students polled
on 19 questions by the Religion-in-Life Committee.

The committee will use the poll results to bring Religion—in-Life

Week speakers on student attitudes toward religion and morals. The
. Tallies on other questions show that 98 out of 111 students be-
heve that God plays an active role in the Universe, and 73 students
think. that a politician who compromises principles, cannot carry
out an effective political program.

To the question on the existence of God, only two students
stated that they positively disbelieved in the existence of God.
Eleven students were certain that wars are justifiable, and twelve
believed with certainty that sex relations before‘ marriage were
“all right.”

Other questions asked were “Do you believe that prayer helps
cure physical ills?” (52 answered yes), and “Do you believe that the
idea of evolution is consistent with the belief in God as a Creator?”
(40 said yes).

The poll indicates that charges of godlessness in modern youth
may not be well-founded. Tallies show, however, that students
answered direct questions like “Do you believe that God exists” with
more solidarity than indirect questions.

  

(Selection  Questions on Page 7) K

All Can Apply

Brailey emphasized that this
practice will permit students of
all races and religions to apply for
any job listed on the bulletin
board. If students are to be dis-
criminated against, the discrimina-
tion will- be on
the part of the
employer dur-
ing personal in-
terviews.

The p 1 a c e-
m e n t director
added that the
bureau will in-
form students if
they are likely
to be discriminated against.

Second part of bureau policy
is that questions of race and re
ligion and space for photographs-

will remain on placement bu-
reau applications ﬁlled out by
graduating seniors for the con-
sideration of employers.

Applications are for the use of
employers who seek trained per-
sonnel from among the graduates
of the University.

No Offers Refused

Third part of placement bureau
policy is based on the fact that the
University does not want to re-
fuse jobs offered by employers
even though the jobs carry racial
and religious requirements.

‘ “We are going to be practical ,
in handling cases where racial

and religious -prejudice exists,
but we shall use our inﬂuence
where it seems feasible to move
(the employer) toward a more
d e m o c r a tic viewpoint,” the
placement director asserted.

w Fraternities

Drop Discrimination

Three Law School fraternities
have solved the problem of racial
and religious discrimination, now
under discussion in most under-
graduate frats.

Phi Delta Phi, Phi Alpha Delta,
and Tau Epsilon Rho, all profes-
sional legal fraternities with ex-
tended social programs, have no
requirements for membership bas-
ed on religion, race and national
origin.

Tau Epsilon Rho, up to last year
composed entirely of Jewish stu-
dents, pledged at that time two
non-Jewish men.

Restriction Removed

The frat had based its discrim-
ination on the feeling that its
members were not eligible for en-
trance into the other law frater-
nities, according to President Ed‘
Goldfarb.

This year, Goldfarb said, TER
invited members of all races and

religions to its rushing stag, and
everyone had “a genuinely good
time.”

Phi Delta Phi, says President
Robert Griewahn, has observed a
policy of non-discrimination, at
least since his entrance into Law
School in 1947.

Asked to comment on relations
between members of the mixed
group, Griewahn said “we don’t
ever think about the differences
(in race and belief) between the
members.”

Woman Wins Vote

One fraternity carried the non-
discrimination policy to the ques-
tion of sex, also, by pledging a
coed last year.
‘ While three fraternities have al-
ready done away with discrimina-
tory clauses, a fourth is reported
to be working on the removal of’ a
clause of this type from its na-
tional constitution.

No Girls, No Quorum

SC Votes Stalled by Absentees

The election of a representative
to succeed Sam Shapiro on the
Athletic Committee failed to ma-
terialize for lack of a quorum at
Student Congress’- weekly meet
Monday. Only one girl was pres-
ent, two being the minimum un-
der the rules.

Ann Pricer’s seat also was left
vacant. The elections will take

place next week.

The congressmen heard a report
on the proposed pep club they en-
dorsed at an earlier meeting. First
meetings of the group will be
March 13.

The solons also decided that the
textbook problem should be left
in the hands of the faculty, al-
though certain book changes were
unfair, some spokesmen assented.

Isotope Cu‘: - off Sen

 

If Congress Fails
To Allocate Funds

Pittsburghers connected with cancer work are Waiting
now to see what will happen if and when the Atomic Energy
Commission _cuts off its supply of free radioactive isotopes

_-as it is supposed to early in May. .

At that time the AEC expects to run out of special
funds it uses to supply the isotopes to hospitals and cancer
research centers. Congress will not make new appropriations

until July 1.

Moses Optomistic

Dr. Campbell Moses, director of the University’s Addison
H Gibson Laboratory, is taking a semi-optimistic view on

the problem. He hopes that

Congress will make special

appropriations to keep the vitally-needed isotopes moving
into cancer battleﬁelds during the two-month interim.

The isotopes are expensive, too expensive for most hos-
pitals and research workers to pay for them out of their own
funds; For example, Dr. Frank Dixon, head of the depart-

ment of pathology, estimates

that the Pitt medical school

alone uses up t-o $50,000 worth of the various isotopes each

year.

Cost Proliibitive
The cost would be prohibitive for the individual cancer

patient.

The average treatment;

D13 Dixon ﬁgures: Would mm tolrough materials into more easily

$400 or $500 if the necessary iso-
topes had to be purchased on the
open market.

As it stands now, the AEC.sup-
plies the rough isotopes to insti-

used chemical compounds. Some
of the work is farmed out to com-
mercial houses.

Dr. Moses does not doubt that

tutions who are doing cancer work. some way will be found to beat
These groups then must reﬁne the the problem.

Newspaper Put Under

Censorship

The University of California
student newspaper, The Daily Cal-
ifornian, operated today under a
form of censorship for the ﬁrst
time in its 40-year history.
-The 16,000 daily lost its inde-
pendence when two articles which

 

appeared in its pages drew the ire
of the Board of Regents.

One of the objectionable ar-

by Regents

ticles was a letter to the Editor in
which the writer charged that the
U.S. press has smeared the Berlin
Festival.»

The other article was an inter-
view with astudent who had tour-
ed Russia. The student claimed
that the Russian people do 'not be-
lieve that slave labor camps ex-
ist.

No one accused any members
of the Daily Californian of being a
communist, pro-communist, or
having communistic tendencies.

President of the University of
California, Robert G. Sproul told
the Board of Regents, “I am sure
there are no communists or com-
munist sympathizers on the Daily
Californian.”

No action on the‘form of cen-
soring was announced.

Alumni Group   Affirms

A committee of distinguished

,Yale ‘graduates, asserting that the

“business of a university is to edu-
cate, not to indoctrinate . . . ” said
the school’s faculty should teach
all sides of any question without
fear of retaliation.

The committee declared that
there were no known Reds or sub-
versies on campus, and said that
rec.ent criticism of the University
for fostering atheism an.d collectiv- ‘
ism was completely unjustiﬁed

I Eight Man Group

The special eight-man group,
appointed by Yale president A.
Whitney Griswold, includes Irving
S. Olds, U.S. Steel executive,
Judge Thomas W. Swan, and the
president emeritus of Union The-
ological Seminary, Henry Sloane
Cofﬁn.

The report stated:

“In a university, knowledge
shouldbe pursued with all chan-
nels of information freely open
to the student. In the ideal uni-
versity all sides of any issue are

forcefully as possible; all sides,
not just those that may be cur-_

“The moment the classroom
presentation of an unpopular po-
sition is restricted or prohibited
by university mandate, the search
for truth is checked and the in-
tegrity of the university comes in‘-
to question,” the committee con-
tinued. _

Reply to ‘God and Man at Yale’

The committee’s report was
taken by most observers as a reply
to William Buckley J r.’s “God and
Man at Yale,” in which Buckley
claimed that “academic freedom”
was being used to undermine re-
ligion and individualism.

Dent Student-Hypnotist Finds C

 

  

Sleepy Scholars Best Subjects

By ELINOIIE STONE

 

It’s all in your mind. And
Charles Novak, a senior in the

School of Dentistry, is very
interested in the state of your
mind; both as an amateur
hypnotist and as a dentist.

Always curious about hyp-
nosis, Charles began reading
everything he could obtain on
the subject about six years
ago. .
‘ used to sit down at Waleck’s
Book Store,” he laughed, “and
read books on hypnotism all after-
noon. I also observed and spoke
with a number of professional
stage hypnotists.” .

Novak was, at the beginning, a
bit leary of trying his skills. His
ﬁrst volunteer was his girlfriend
whom he successfully hypnotized
and did, incidently, successfully
awaken her again.

Scared Himself -

Novak was a bit frightened be-

causeihis ‘ﬁrst attempt worked so

well and fervently continued his.‘
research into the powers of hyp-

nosis. Since then, he has hypno-
tized a number of fellow-students.

There’s no “hocus-pocus-you’re—
asleep” or evil-eye stare involved
in Novak’s technique. By seating

"a person comfortably in a quiet

warm room and having him con-
centrate on some single object,
Novak can induce him to sleep
mer ly by suggestion. His soft,
deep voice and charming manner
are quite adequate. ,.

There are any number of thing
he may ask the victim to do. .One
is to have him stretch out between
two chairs with his head on one
and only his “toes on the other.
Stiff as a board, a person in such a
‘deep trance becomes useable as a
bench.

His roommate spotted it and being 8'

Just saw “Dear Maggy”. So he addressed
an envelope to Maggy II at Northamp,

various ages will show the per-

Because some skeptics refuse to
believe they’ve been hypnotized,
Novak will often stick a pin into
his subject and upon awakening
him, show him the mark to prove
he had temporarily departed.

With his skill, Novak has per-

said, “and complained he just_
couldn’t study for an exam the
next day. I- put him to sleep and
told him he had to study and learn

next morning at seven, my friend
was still studying.”
Habit Breaker

It’s also possible to break a habit
such as smoking by hypnotizing
the smoker and telling him he
must stop. “After two or three

smoke should be gone.”

Novak has found that students
make the best subjects. “They are
subjected’ to so many boring lec-
tures in schoo ,” he explained,
“that they’re/ easily put torsleep.”

In his work as a dentist, Novak ,

has found his knowledge of hyp-
nosis helpful. Some of the skill
he’s acquired in putting people to
sleep is carried over and helpful
in allaying the fears of children or

' Huge 4-—THE' PITT NEWS-—Wednesday, -February 27, 1952

No Stone llnturned I

We have just ﬁnished observing a week
during which the problems of racial and
religious discrimination were given a thor-
ough airing. The problems were approached
from the conviction that they are essentially
un-American,, un—democratic and harmful to
the nation and the individual. If there were
other opinions, the people who held them
were not brave enough to let them be known.

Some of the opponents of discrimination
last week urged forceful and dramatic ac-
tion. They felt that publicity and pressure,
strengthened by laws, were the only really ef-
fective solutions.

There were others who advocated a quiet,
relentless attack. They held that discrimina-
tion could best be eliminated by individual
action and by personal conviction. it ,_

In today’s News you will _ﬁnd theresults
of both approaches. Due to the publicity
and pressure growing out of the work of the
Student Congress committee investigating

, discrimination, the University Placement Bu-

reau has eliminated publicizing job offers
which carry racial restrictions.

In the Law School three professional fra- ,

ternities, without any pressure, followed the
decent instincts of their members and re-
moved racial and religious restrictions from
their membership‘ qualiﬁcations. I
These two successes in the economic and

" social ﬁelds indicate that ‘much can be said

for "both methods. We should use an the
means at our disposal until the last battle
for democracy is fought. That battle will be

fought in the privacy of men’s minds.

Na UM T Bills

In the editorial “UMT Threat”,which ap-
peared in this column last Friday, we de-
voted nine paragraphs to opposing the Uni-
versal Military Training program. Due to
an error at the printers, the editorial ended
with “the bill should be enacted into law.”

For those who are confused we wish to
go on record as opposed to any and all Uni-
versal Military Training program for the
reasons stated last Friday. a ' e editorial

should have ended “the bill should NOT be ’

enacted‘ into law.” _

‘At the Playhouse... ,
Miss Thompson

Kudos to

Credit Fred Burleigh with a
touch of old Erin’s guile. For the
Playhouse director, with a truly
stunning assist from Miss Sada
Thompson, has brought “Peg 0’
My Heart” to Craft Ave. and this
is a rare and joyous event.

The wiles and wonderments of
this Irish lass have seen a thou-
sand stages before, but I serious-
ly doubt that they have been in
more affectionate or "exciting
hands than Miss Thompson’s.
She is the freshest, funniest, most
lovable acrtess ever to grace the
Playhouse, and my heart is hers.

I A I'-'ro,|ic'some Lass

Brieﬂy, because I wish to re-
turn to Miss ‘Thompson, this is J.
Hartley Manners’ classic, comedy
concerning Peg O’Connell, the
poor, frolicsome, -little Irisher

come to visit her rich relations, ’

the Chichesters.

'Caught up in the shallow pom-
posities of her aunt and two
cousins, she gives them a lesson
in manners, stamps them with

her personal brand of havoc, and,

wins the heart of a nobleman in
the bargain. .

There seems to be injustice
afoot here in not billing,Sada
Thompson above “Peg 0’ My

Heart,” for this young woman
has cut herself a masterpiece and
such a triumph should not go
unrewarded. She is an- irresist-
able delight and I advise you to
make haste in securing tickets.
Support Pretty Wonderful
Lest his take on the look of a
love let er, let it be stated that
Miss Thompson’s partners’ in fun

‘are pretty wonderful too. Robert

Bardwell’s Sir erry is a sparkling
complement to “Peg,” and as
Alaric, Paul Shively taps a ‘rich
and comic vein for this brittle-
brained wastrel.

Alma ‘Lind, Billie Frederick,’
William Putch, and Tom Swan
provide charmful foils," and Leon
Ward, Helen Weber, and an un-
listed canine called “Mike” are
right at home among the laugh-
ter. ‘ ’

The program notes mentioned
that John Van Druten’s “Voice
Of The Turtle” would be the next
attraction at the Playhouse. Mr.
Burleigh could hardly do. better
than return Mr. Van Druten’s
work to the mothballs and keep
Miss Sada Thompson and her
“Peg 0’ My Heart” on his door-
step indeﬁnitely. Sure and a
couple months 0’ laughs won’ti
hurt anyone. - ’

In regard to the so-called
“witchhunt” c o n c e r n i n g the
prices of food served in the Tuck
Shops, I would like Miss Ruth
Cramblet to explain thepricing

of one item, namely, Hot Fudge-

Sundaes. _

I purchased a dish of vanilla
ice cream in the Tuck Shop
which consisted of: one plastic

, holder, one liner, one small scoop

of ice cream. Price ten (l0c)
cents.

The very next day I purchased
a Hot Fudge Sundae which obn-
sisted of: one plastic holder, one
paper liner, one small scoop of
ice cream, two spoonfuls of
fu’dge. Price twenty-ﬁve (25c)
cents. . I

As you can plainly see, the
only difference between the two
purchases was the addition of
the fudge. How is it possible to
ascertain that and justify that

two ‘spoonfuls of fudge should
cost\ﬁfteen (15c) cents?

probably be tremendous, operating costs could be’,
paid many Aways--—by.state, county or city funds,
non-proﬁticivic groups, maybe even_ by selling Al-

University Policy Their Barrier

ii! I!

By RUSSELL FRANKIE‘.
Two of the finest young swimmers in the area can’t make

the Panther team.

It’s not that they aren't good enough-—they’re just the
wrong sex. And so Patty Lou Swaney and Nancy Zentgraf

content themselves with their

studies and being two of the

more lovely members of the student body.
Both are freshman scholarship students in physical ed-

ucation as a result of various
championships in AAU competi-
tion, but are unable to enter col-
legiate swimming simply because
Pitt does not have an athletic pro-
gram for girls.
From A Swimming Family

The blonde, 19-year old Patty
recently gained local acclaim at
the Taylor Award ceremony-
through her outstanding perform-
ances'at Uniontown, where she
has been competing at the YMCA
for seven years. Right now she
swims unattached. '

Nancy, a petite brunette of 18,
comes from a family of ﬁne swim-
mers. Big brother Jim is a main-
stay of this year’s crack crew,
while her father, Henry, is the
220—yard Junior National breast
stroke champion. Two younger
brothers are on their way up in
the tank sport.

Strangely enough, Nancy’s coach

Fins Beat Lions,
Bow to Army

The Panther tankers gained an
even split over the weekend in
New York to bring their season
record to eight wins, two ‘losses,
and one tie.

After racking up their sixth
straight victory at Columbia Fri-
day, 49-35, the local took only
three first places at West Point in
dropping a 47-37 meet to a tough
Army crew Saturday.

This weekend, Coach Ben Grady
leads his charges on the“ road
westward for a triangular meet
with Wayne University and Cin-
cinnati at Detroit Friday and then
to Michigan State for a Saturday
afternoon engagement. The Spar-
tans have lost only once to date,
and that was to Ohio "State, which
also dealt Pitt its ﬁrst loss.

Saturday will also mark the end
of the regular dual schedule for
the ﬁns, who will then prepare for

‘the Eastern Collegiates at Lehigh

next week.

Matmen Learn Olympic Rules
After Whipping WVU in Finale

A

By DON SCHURMAN

After tearing through their
regular‘ season at a record-
breaking 9-2 pace, Rex Peery’s
matmen are now learning the rules
of wrestling—of the Olympic va-
riety, that is.

Since the entire Pitt team will
be entered in the Olympic tryouts
at the Field House on April 9 and
10, the principles of Olympic
wrestling——which diﬁers consider-
ably from the intercollegiate style
—are to be included in Peery’s
practices, beginning tomorrow.

Right now, however, the grapp-
lers are enjoying a four-day rest
after concluding their regular sea-
son with a 25-3 win at West Vir-
ginia last Saturday. The current
team has now equaled the number
of victories scored in Pitt’s en-
tire ten-year mat history.

Solomon Leading Scorer

Reflecting on his decisive set-

back, WVU Coach Steve Harrick

 

JOE SOLOMON
Leading Mat Scorer

   

commented, “Pitt has a great team.
They are by far the best we’va
met this year.” Earlier in the year,-
the Mountaineers met Maryland,
pace-setters of the Southern Con-
ference.

Scoring his third fall of the sea-
son, Joe Solomon (9-1-1) remains
the individual scoring leader with
39 points. Hugh Peery (10-1) with
36 and Charley Uram (2-l-2) with.
30 trail Solomon.

Conditioning All-Important

“The Olympic, rules stress put-
ting the opponent‘s shoulders on
the mat,” says Coach Peery. “If
a man’s shoulders touch the mat

simultaneously even for a fraction '

of a second, it’s a fall.

“Because of this, conditioning is/-

a much more -important factor
than in collegiate competition,”
continues Peery. “Besides, the
match is 15 minutes long. Speed
and skill are, nevertheless, still

Cagers Zernich, Burch

Lead in Floor Statistics

Not even a sensational display
of scoring or play-making can al-

ter the statistics cornered by
Mickey Zernich and Clarence
“Dutch” Burch. '

As Pitt’s hoopsters prepare for
their ﬁnal game of the season with
Penn State Saturday, Zernich and
Burch boast a one-two act in ev-
ery department except rebounds.
And there, Center Don Virostek
leads all the way with 189.

Leading scorer among the var-
sity ﬁoormen, again, is Zernich
with 330 points. Mickey has paced
his teammates all season and
ranks among the top three scorers
in the city. Only Duquesne’s Jim
Tucker and Carnegie’s Tom Craig
outpoint him.

His total has been compiled on
114 ﬁeld goals and 102 of 160 foul
shots. Nearest rival to Zernich’s
15.7 game average and other scor-
ing marks is Burch.

Pitt’s sophomore guard trails-
but not close1y—-with a 10.6 aver-
age. With a total of 223 points on
85 ﬁelders and 53 fouls, no one
can alter their position as top
point-makers.

DON MURDOCK

. Sports Editor
The whole darn Athletic Department is prejudiced.
When Dr. H. C. Carlson Was on the pan for racial bigotry,
it was easy to think that if Jim Tucker had enrolled at Pitt,

he wouldn’t be wasted.

But in sports reporterRuss Fra'nke’s story on page

ﬁve we ﬁnd two swimming lovelies-—Nancy Zentgraf and
‘Patty Lou Swaney—here at Pitt, but whose talents are
being wasted through the narrow policy of the University.

Although Dean Helen P. Rush:

would never sanction mixed
swimming, it would undoubtedly
draw the male specttors to the
home swim events.

Swimming Is Clean ,
Imagine the look of amazement
on Jim Zentgrafs face when his
sister Nancy beats him by ten
yards in the~100-yard free style
event- »
If anyone argues that fou
play would come about in mixed
swimming, he can be persuaded-
otherwise by realizing that
swimming is one of the cleanest
collegiate sports.
Offhand, I know of three schools
——-‘Purdue, Michigan State, and

, , Bowling Green—that have girl

swimming teams. a

Opportunity Knocks But Once

Last year Allegheny College had
a girl tennis player on its all-male
net team and, incidentally, she did
a good job.‘

Young ladies of the Univer-
sity, rise up and overthrow the
yoke of the University and allow -
the female species to carry the

‘ Blue-and-Goldi banner at its

swimming events next winter.
Pitt’s home pool for the pastitwo

; years at the YMHA has discour-

.3

aged top tank teams from booking
away meets with =Grady’s ﬁns;
consequently -the Panthers face a
schedule of too few home meets.

Whoopee! A Winter Sport
This policy could be ended if

the following were done: Sell the
basketball ﬂoor at the Field House
to a school erecting a new basket-
ball structure. Build a swimming
pool in its place and construct a
basketball floor over the pool
much in the same manner as the
basketball court used by Kansas
State and Kansas at Kansas City.
When Carlson-’s cagers were
in action we would have the,
basketball ﬂoor, and when

"Grady’s mixed swimming team

was facing the nation’s best .
swimming squads we would
have the pool. And. with a nu— J
cleus of swimming beauties like 1
Nancy and Patty Lou, the
Standing Room Only sign would
be out at every home meet.

The University would be making
money, Pitt would have a winter
sport, and Grady would be "living
on top of the world with a win-
ner. The only loser would be the

.male participants ‘who would be

set down a notch by the perform-
ances of their female counter-
parts. _

The chances of this happening
are slim, however, since Pitt re-
ceives a small endowment from
the state for its athletics.

If a full-time student here
wants to compete in a sport
should he be ignored because of
race, creed, or sex? lt’s something
to think about. ‘ '

Johnstown Drops PIA,
Civil A’s Still Unbeaten

By DAVE MAZER

Playing with only ﬁve men, the Pitt Independent Asso-
ciation extended the J ohnstown Center before bowing, 54-43,
in an Independent League contest Monday afternoon.

The game was a see-saw affair until early in the second
period when three straight baskets by George Straub opened
the. gates for the J ohnies. They led at the half, 23-15.

-In the third quarter, using the fast‘ break‘ to good» ad— ~

vantage, they widened their ,mar-

~ gin,» leading atone time by as
- much as 21 points.

However, the PIA’s, with their
brother act of Ray and Don Why
showing the way, climbed to with-
in ten, points of their opponents
only to run out of time. Ray Why
was high man in, scoring with 22

markers while Roy Allen had 13 .

The Civil A’s led at halftime by

Peery Has Expetience

Hugh Peery is the‘ only one on
the squad with any experience un-
der the Olympic rules, having won
the Pan—American Olympics in the
114.5 class last year. Because of
the - increased emphasis on
strength, however, heavyweight
Eldred Kraemer is also an Olym-
pic hopeful.

Anyone may enter the tryout
tourney, and many local high
school and YMCA stars are ex-.
pected to compete. The top two
winners in each weight division
will go to the ﬁnals at Ames, Iowa
on April 18 and 19.

Religion on Campus

By LOIS HOLLERAN
(Religion-in—Life Week (Mar. 2-8) emphasizes the place of
God in a’ college student’s life every year, but various campus
religious clubs have year-round programs designed to do the
7 same thing. The following sketches are designed to acquaint stu-

dents with current club calendars.)

Pitt undergraduates are not the only ones interested in
keeping religious organizations active. Two graduate student

groups on campus prove this.
Catholic Club

Contrary to its name, a person
does not have to be a college grad-
uate to join the University Cath-
olic’ Club.

I This club has two classes of
membership: active members —
which include Catholic graduates

sities and associate members-—
which includes any person inter-
ested in the aims and activities of
the organization.

Dues are ﬁve. dollars a year and
membership privileges are ex-
tended to the wife or husband of

This club oﬁers spiritual, edu-
cational, and social programs. The
spiritual activities include Cath-
olic philosophy study clubs, Com-
munionbreakfasts, Christmas bas-
kets to the poor, and a Day of Rec-
ollection.

Free, monthly lectures by noted
.church and secular speakers, book
review groups, and discussion
groups which analyze Catholic
teaching comprise the educational
schedule.

The social committee plans one
event each month. ’Stag parties”
radio programs, glee, clubs, bowling
and dances complete the social ac-
tivities. , “‘

Next on the club agenda is a Day
of Recollection at St. Francis re-
treat house, Beechwood Blvd., on,
Sunday, March 9. i

Anyone interested in joining the
group should contact club head-_
quarters at 2915 Webster Ave., 

Pgh. 19, or call Mayﬂower 1-1118.

about 35 members, with a six to
one ratio in favor of the men,
they still succeed inhaving Sun-
day night suppers and discussion
meetings, occasional weekend trips
to West Va., dancing, and bridge.

Anyone interested in joining the
group should go to the Sunday
evening supper at the Unitarian
Church, corner of .Morewood and
Ellsworth. Aves.

The group discusses educational,
political, and social problems on
an intellectual level.

Their most outstanding activity
is the week-end trips to Ogelbay
Park, West Va. Usually, the group
leaves here Friday night and re-
turns Sunday evening. It rents
two cabins, cooks its own meals,
plays bridge, square dance, and
generally, relaxes. .

Since there are so few women
in the club it is only natural that
they are seeking female members.
Men, however, are always wel-
comed to the group because their
primary purpose is cultural and
intellectual, not match-making.
