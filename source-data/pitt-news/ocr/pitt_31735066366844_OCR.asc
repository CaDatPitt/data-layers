Wants Legislature
To Lower Tuition  

The State Board of Edu-
cation adopted a resolution
Thursday which asked the
State to give the University
$12,200,000 to cut its tuition
from $1,400 to_$450 for in-

"state students. The Board, in a

nine to three vote also offered
two alternative plans to the leg-
islature, which must-meet in spe-
cial-session if the Board’s target
date of this fall is to be met.
The proposal is very close to
what the University wants, ac-
cording to Acting Chancellor Da-
vid H. Kurtzman, who termed
the resolution “favorable to the

University.” The Board of Educa- -

tion’s resolution is not legislative-
ly binding upon the state, but is
only an advisory measure. How-
ever, it is expected that the Leg-
islature, if it approves state-re-
latedness, would adopt the Board’s
ideas with very few changes.
The resolution asks that the
$12,000,000 be placed in a special
state account at the University,
as opposed to the regular Univer-
sity account. The University
would then allocate the funds to
those areas where the state either

I speciﬁesthat the money be spent

or where it would be.permissible

to spend under the general pro-

visions of the Legislature’s reso-

lution. A

The state would have the right
to review both accounts, but it
will have veto power only over
its own. The resolution also calls
for nine of the 33 men on the
Board of Trustees to be appoint-
ed by the governor. The state.
will also be represented by the
governor and the state superin-
tendent of public instruction. The
City of Pittsburgh will be rep-
resented, as it is at the present
time, by the mayor.

The resolution asked that tui-
tion for out-of-state students be’
set by the University rather than
the state. Commenting on this,
the resolution stated that “The
Board recognizes that there are
advantages to Pennsylvania stu-
dents in having among them stu-
dents from other states and from
other countries.”

Dean of Admissions Jack B.
Critchﬁeld said Thursday night
that tuition for out-of-state stu-
dents will not be reduced next
year. However, he predicted an
increase in the amount of schol-
arship funds open to the out-of-
staters as 'a result of the de-
creased need of Pennsylvania stu-
dents.

V If this policy were continued
indeﬁnitely, it would mean that
out-of-staters would be paying at
least three. times more than Penn-
sylvania students, as has been
done at Penn State and Temple,

versities.
However, the Pittsburgh Press,
reported that “Pitt officials are’
opposed to such a wide differen-
tial.” The University hopes to:
determine the out-of-state tuition-
and if allowed to do so by the
state, the tuition will be lower-
ed in the near future, probably,
for the 1967-67 academic year.
Whatever amount is ﬁnally ap-
propriated by the Legislatur
will be tailored speciﬁcally to the
University’s needs and its cost-:

in the past, Present state appro-
priations for the University’s

Dean, Jack Critchﬁeld Explains
State Aid At Dorm Co uncil Program

The University hopes to reduce
out-of-state tuition, if it goes state,
although such a reduction will
not occur until after next year,
according to Jack Critchﬁeld, dean
of admissions.

Critchﬁeld told a disappoint-

 ingly small crowd of 20 in Tower
_ A Lobby Wednesday night that

“student aid to out-of-state stu-

_ dents will continue, and maybe in

better form as the University will
have twice as much ﬁnancial aid

» available for these students be-

cause of Pennsylvania subsidies
to state students.

“With the state-related plan the
administration is ﬁghting for
now, Pitt will have full authority
as to how many out-of-state stu-
dents we accept,” the Dean as-
sured the group. He expressed
hopes of keeping the proportion
of out-of-state to state students
the same as it is now.

Critchﬁeld said that “we have
every reason to believe that we

To Speak

Dr. Richard Luecke, direc-
tor of Studies for the Urban
Training Center for Chris-
tian Mission of Chicago, will
speak Sunday at the 11 a.m.
Heinz Chapel service. His
topic will be “None So Sound-
ly Sleep.”

Dr. Luecke is a graduate
of Concordia Seminary in St.
Louis and holds his masters
degree from Wayne Univer-
sity in Detroit and his Ph.D.
from the University of Chi-
cago.

He has taught English,
humanities, and philosophy,
in addition to serving pastor-
ates in Chicago and Prince-
ton, N. J. He has contributed
numerous articles to thelog-
ical publications.

will have a better student body
in the future than we have ever
had.” He explained that the Uni-
versity has lost, in the past three
years, between 200 and 300 of
its finest applicants because it
has not had adequate funds to
compete with ﬁnancial aid offer-
ed by other colleges, funds that
will be. available in a. state-re-
lated situation.

The University will also attract,
according to Critchﬁeld, 300 to
400 local students who don’t ap-
ply to a college because of ﬁnan-
cial conditions, or who enroll at
small state colleges whose com-
bined costs of tuition and room
andboard are less than the Uni-
versity’s present tuition.

If the University seeks a class
of 1,600 freshmen next year, the
Dean told the students “the bot-
tom 300 students will be much
better than the present bottom
300.”

Critchﬁeld is conﬁdent that if

Rexroth
To Discuss

Today’s Arts

Wine-bibber-journalist-editor-
translator-jazz club performer-
painter-cook-gourmet-labor lead-
er-poet-playwrightcomposer-ac-
tor-critic Kenneth Rexroth will
speak Wednesday at noon in the
Student Union Ballroom.

As a breather from conducting
his usual open-end seminars at
San Francisco State College, en-
titled “Creative Projects,” he will
discuss “The Arts in an Age of
Anxiety.”

Rexroth was educated in the
Chicago public schools, the Chi-
cago Art Institute, the New School
for Social Research, _and the Art
Student's League.

Claiming two Commonwealth
Club medals for literature, two
Guggenheim Fellowships, the
Tietjens Award from the Poetry
Magazine and the Shelly Memori-
al Award from the Poetry So-
ciety of America, the Public Af-
fairs speaker has written 18 books
and numerous magazine articles.

Rexroth’s published works in-
clude: In What Hour, The Phoe-
nix and the Tortoise, The Signa.
lure of All Things, The Art of
Worldly Wisdom, The Dragon
and the Unicorn, and In Defense
of Earth.

He has also written many
translations and interpretations
of Far Eastern literature.

A coffee hour will follow the
lecture at 3 p.m.

the University can announce a
reduction in tuition by May 1, it
will be able. to attract addi-
tional 400 commuting freshmen.
The University, however, will
not accept a, class of more than
2,000, he said.

There will be none of the rum-
ored “ﬂooding” of any and all
Pennsylvania students over the
University, Critchﬁeld told the
group. “As the State supplies
more physical facilities, the Uni-
versity will increase enrollment
for qualiﬁed, and only qualiﬁed
students.” ,

The recently quoted ﬁgure of a
1,000 increase in enrollment for
the fall term “was a token esti-
mate of the University's willing-
ness to serve the population.”
Critchﬁeld explained that this ﬁg-
ure was used to request the proj-
ected ﬁnancial needs of the Uni-
versity to the State and if ac-
cepted 600 of these students will
be transfers or graduates.

STUDENT AID

Anyone applying for student
aid for the fall term of the
1966-67 academic year must
have his application ﬁled no
later than March 15 in the Of-
ﬁce of Student Aid, 107 Stu-
dent Union (SU). Any ques-
tions should be directed to the
office, extension 7240. Ques-
tions on fall trimester regis-
tration should be directed to

New Towers Rules

(The following 1n-oposrzl has been }n'e.s-enter! by the Pitt P7'og7‘es-
~*‘1"'(’ PCINU (PPP) ti’ Ha'7'l‘(’!/ Lefton, P*resirlent—-1l1en’s Dm'mitm'y

an alternative plan (lea-z',(/rzcrl to replace the current ]lIen’s Dorm. Coun-
cil rules on clz'.s~triImtz'on of lite7'atm'e. The (Lcceptability of the proposal
is in the jm*is(lz'ction of 11/1Il)C,(m(lthe Office of Student Affairs.)

Regulations prohibiting the distribution of literature directly to.
the rooms of the men’s dormitories have been in effect since October.
During these six months, the PPP has consistently sought means to
review and hopefully reﬁne these regulations. During discussions with
representatives of the Men’s Dormitory Council as well as student
and administrative leaders from throughout the University, we have
been informed of the reasons for and the goals of these regulations.
After giving careful consideration -to the oponions and ideas of others,
the Pitt Progressive Party would like to offer the following alterna-
tive to the present regulations: A‘ ~

PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF LITERATURE

> 1. Any University student or organization may distribute literature
directly to the rooms of the Men’s Dormitories.

> 2. On the day that anyone plans to distribute, he must register his
intent to do so in the Men’s Housing Office. ‘At that time, he must
indicate (a) who will distribute the literature and (b) the appro-
ximate time of the distribution. The Men’s Housing Office will
issue a registration slip which must accompany those individuals
when they distribute. '

.On the individual floors of the Towers, the following regulations
must be observed: (a) Before distributing on a floor, the person
distributing must notify the ﬂoor counselor on that floor. If the
ﬂoor counselor is not in his room, the individual should either
inform the House counselor or the other floor counselor in that
house; (b) The only method of distribution is under the doors of
the individual rooms; (c) There is not to be excessive noise when
distributing the literature (e.g. knocking on the doors, congregat-
ing in the halls, loudly speaking, etc), and (d) The distribution
is to be completed, above all, quickly and quietly.

If the regulations as listed in Section 2 and Section 3 of the
above regulations are not observed, a complaint may be brought
by any resident of the Towers to either the MDC Judicial Board
(when established) or an appropriate board designated by MDC.
The board may take appropriate action against any individual
or organization which violates the above regulations, however,
that action may not exceed denying the right of distribution in
the Towers.

>4.

The PPP believes that the above proposed regulations are both
just and needed, for they effectively. deal with two problems which
confront the residents of the Towers, security and disturbance. The
Men’s Dorms are essentially “open” dorms, that is that any individual
may enter onto the ﬂoor at any time for any reason. None of the
regulations regarding the distribution of literature in the dorms will
prevent individuals (from both the University and from outside the
University community), from entering the ﬂoors. What Section 2 above
does is to assure that no individual will be entering a ﬂoor and/or
a room on the pretense of distributing literature. Secondly, the above
regulations assure that the noise and disturbance will be kept to an
absolute minimum, while providing for the most effective means of
communication among members of the University.

Th Resolution  
- We heartily endorse the primary resolution adopted Thursday by the State Board
of Education. Several fears about increased state‘-relatedness over the passed months are
dispelled by the Board’s recommendation.
.. First the rate of out-of-state students will not be the catastrophic Temple—like di-
lemma. Out-of-state students at Temple are required to pay three times as much for tui-
;-tion as in-state students. The requirement was written into a bill last year which in-
——*creased Tempie's state affiliation. ' . _ _ _
‘ The Board’s resolution does not recommend such an inappropriate cost differential.
_. Tuition costs for out-of-state students would. bedetermined by the University,dn£){t the
state. Such an arrangement is promising, considering Acting Chancellor Dr. Davi ur z-

man's continual assertion that we will not allow the adoption of a disproportionate, unfair

4 tuition system. _ _
g ' Second, the fear of State control over University ‘programming, through allo-
cation of funds, is removed in the current resolution. It provides the State with nine of 33
‘members on the Board of Trustees. Such an.arrangement allows State representatlon C0m-
-ineiisurate with its ﬁnancial support while leaving the decision-making two-third non-
‘State people. _ _ 1_ ,
Also, the State would only have veto power over money in its own account. Since the
‘bulk of money in the State-account would be devoted to subsidizing tuition costs, there would

, be little control in the areas of academic programming, faculty selection, and promotion.
We urge the State legislative’s adoption of the Board’s resolution without changing
the out-of-state student and Board of Trustees provisions. We urge it be adopted and not
- the other alternatives being offered. . ' I . _ _ _
We further recommend student participation in the upcoming‘ events pertaining t3

the nearly—fulﬁlled new state relationship. Fill out the trimester questionnaire today, atten
, open programs on the issue, and encourage your local and state representatives to meet
_in special session to adopt the Board’s proposal.

Editor, The Pitt News
I was quite disturbed by the
article on the swimming team ap-

- pearing in your March 7 issue. It

seems most absurd to read of a
coach describing two of his team
members with the phrase: “These
boys aren’t good enough.”

Hulme, a 3.8 engineering stu-
will return next season
while Price is only a sophomore
without a scholarship. Granted
that neither may be a Don Schol-

-ander, they nevertheless repre-

sent the team’s future and ridi-
culing them can do nothing but
destroy team morale not to men-
tion the team itself.

If coach Grady wishes to offer

I Frank “Ho-Hum” Smizik excuses
O -for this year’s poor showing in

an attempt to stay Frank’s po-
tent pen from inﬂicting another
execution, I suggest he do so

-without destroying next year’s

team.
It is quite easy for a coach to

‘blame lack of "success on lack of

talent, so it seems that until
Grady enrolls in Dave Hart’s
salesmanship course and comes
up with a few returning Olympi-
ans, Smizik and his hatchet men
will have much to be unhappy
about. Anyone knowing a Fuller
Brush salesman with any swim-
ming experience should contact
the athletic office without a delay.

"ing the student body for lack of

support of the continuously los-

rather tongue-in-cheek, a “Well-
have been

rﬁnals we won something (at last,

if one believes the page six edi-

and told myself that if the most
exciting motion he saw was an
“over the shoulder catch (Willie
Mays style)” then he must have
been interviewing the contestants
and not watching the competi
tion. Mr. Pepper’s adjacent col-
umn was devoted to Steve Co-
hen’s exciting Saturday night
performance. Two sentences were
given to Dave Shidemantle’s per-
formance on the long horse with-
out mentioning what vaults he
did, his individual scores or even
correctly spelling the name of his
closest competitior. Cohen's pic-
ture completed the column des-

fact that Shidemantle will go on-

to the Eastern Regionals in a few
weeks.

Being a woman and a non-
physical education major, I may
not understand the situation as
well as Mr. Smizik or Mr. Pepper.
I realize that many people may
not ﬁnd in gymnastics the emo-

cannot condone slipshod, lethar-

who could very much inﬂuence
student support and participation.

of indifferent attitudes if I fail
to attend every competition. I'll
be too busy wondering if the

Satchmo Great

Jazz Artist
Editor, The Pitt News:

In your March 4 issue I was
disturbed by a number of com-
ments in the Billboard column,
entitled “Satchmo.” I feel that a
few clarifications are in order
since the article tends to put
Louis Armstrong in an unfav-
orable l-ight.

It should have been noted that"

Louie has been playing the trum-
pet professionally for 50 years.
When a trumpet man has played
this long his lips or “chops” be
come literally scarred. This lim-
its both the quality and frequen-
Cy of playing. The article im-
plies that Louie was not in ﬁne
form for the Carnegie Hall con

.v c,e_rt‘which_ Could be entirely true..

     

Letters to the Editor

Everybody can have an off night-
The article also states ‘that
Louis Armstrong is not a great
musician anymore. I would take
exception to this statement as
would a numberlof jazz critics
who placed Louis fourth in trum-
pet and first in the male singer
category of the 1965 Down Beat
International Critics Poll.‘

However, the statement which
most‘ disturbed me was, “nor was
he ever a truly great ‘musician,
some argue.” One of the most
widely accepted opinions among
jaz musicians, jazz critics, and
jazz fans is that Louis Armstrong
is one of the greatest jazzmen of
all time. In fact there are many,
many people that feel “Satch” is
both the greatest trumpet player
and the greatest artist ever pro-
duced by jazz.

I do not think that many jazz
knowledgeable people would deny
the greatness of Louis Armstrong,
if any. I think the article was
illuminating in picturing Louie
and his group at a jazz concert
but I think clariﬁcation and elim-
ination of highly questionable
comments would have made it
much better.

Because of extensive coverage by The Pitt News the
entire community knows of the honors bestowed during Tap
Day ceremonies. But due to some unfortunate oversight few
students, except those attending, know of the proceedings
of the annual Backhand-Slap Day awards banquet.

Slap Day, as it is called, is an old University tradition
honoring those who have excelled in not being outstanding

bers were Fluids, honoring men spending
the greatest total time in Cicero’s, Edward’s
and Gustine’s; Quaffs, honoring women
meeting the qualiﬁcation of Fluids; Sneex,
women named by the Sub.-Basement for
breaking the most dorm rules; and Preg,
National Unmarried Women’s Dishonorary.

ALSO NAMED were'Senior and Junior
~ Unworthies, Mr. and Mrs. Unﬁt, and new
CIKOSKI members for the honorary non-achievement
fraternities such as KKK (community disservice), 000 (Na
tional Pre-quack) and BVD (yellow journalism). But the
most sought-after and most eagerly awaited award is the
ODK, for Omigodwhata Dum Kid, Man of the Year. This
award is given-to the Senior Man who most evidences total
disinterest in the University while still managing to grad-
uate, Such a student must never belong to any organization,
never attend any University function, never have his name
or picture in any University publication, and give the best
evidence of having the morals of a chimpanzee. The awardee’s’
name is scratched on the wall of the third stall of the second
floor men’s room. -

Since my space is limited I cannot give the names
of those slapped at the recent fete,‘ which is unfortunate be-
cause I would probably be torn to shreds, but I can give a
brief run-down of the program.

THE SLAPEES crowded into the Oakland Original,
scene of the banquet, and enjoyed Franks au Sauerkraut be-
fore the presentations. M.C. Neal Geﬁlte, past president of
Fluids, then introduced the speaker, John Edsel, who spoke
on_the value of failure in society. The speech was well re-
ceived until it was learned that Edsel was not connected
with the banquet and was only in the Original to get some
coffee. The scheduled speaker, Barry Goldwater, did not
appear.

The spirit of good will prevailed, however, and Edsel
was allowed to leave with only minor injuries. Next, to the
sound of happy burps from the crowd, Geﬁlte supervised
the various awards, joining heartily in the applause and also .
in several of the ﬁst ﬁghts. Slap Day means just what it
says. ’

FINALLY THE BIG moment arrived and Geﬁlte an-
nounced this year’s ODKMOY. The award went to Jerry
Keeshka, and the correctness of the selection was proven
when it was discovered he had not come to the banquet.
By the way, if you know l\/Ir. Keeshka you needn’t bother
congratulating him. Since his name has now been published '
in my column he is no longer eligible and the space on the
stall wall will remain vacant until next year. '

Remember Last Year? as

By Vicki Epstein

About one year ago 130 students from the University,
Mount Mercy College, Chatham Co1lege_and Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology left Pittsburgh for_ Montgomery, Ala.
Participating in marches and rallies, a feeling of brother-
hood and love for the impoverished Negroes developed along
with distrust and dislike for Southern whites. The greatest
learning experiences came from talking until the early hours
of the morning, sleeping on the ﬂoors of churches and homes,
and experiencing -life in a ghetto. ' .

At the time of the trip many University students ex- I.
pressed their personal agreement and disagreement but all
shared a common concern for their classmates in Mont-
gomery. ‘ .

STUDENTS ARE again being asked to show their in-
terest in the Southern situation. The people in Tent City,
Miss., are not asking for volunteers to march on the Capi-
tol Building nor face the billy clubs of state troopers. These
Negroes have lost their jobs and been thrown out of their
homes. _ , ,

Women who were paid $3 a day and men earning from
$4 to $6 a day asked their ‘plantation owners for higher
wages. The families were evicted. They set up tents while

the plantation ‘owners replaced them with machines and *”

Graduate Students’ Wives Unite .

To Solve Newcomers’ Problems

By NANCY FUCHS
When the wives of graduate students move to
a new university, they face a double-edged prob-

lem: adjustment to a strange city and a limited.

income. They need to ﬁnd housing, make new
friends, and learn about their new home away
from home. The Pitt Graduate Student Wives As-
sociation was formed last May to meet these needs.

The organization’s purpose, according to its
Constitution, is “to promote social and educational
activities among wives of graduate students.” Mrs.
Claire Seymour, president of the group, interprets
the main purpose as the development of friendship.

“Probably the biggest diﬁiculty for women in
this situation is never seeing their husbands. It
is sort of like being part of a service family. The
husband often has to work seven days a week.
Since graduate students and their wives do not

- go out together as much as the average American

couple, our organization gives the wives an oppor-
tunity for some social activity, Mrs Seymour said.
_ About 35 members come to the meetings held
the third Monday of every month at 8 p.m. in the
Conference Room of the Mellon Bank at Fifth and
Craig Stree.ts. “Somewhere between one-third and
one half of these women are wives of physics grad-
uate students. A few wives of medical and dental
students come, too, but we have not contacted the
wives of students in other professional schools
because they generally have their own groups,”
Mrs. Seymour explained.

“We have found that the majority of women
do not want planned social activities,” Mrs. Sey-
mour added. Although the March 21 meeting is a
fashion show, the programs thus far have been
mainly educational. They included talks by three
Mellon professors, discussion about the University
by Savina Skewis, dean of women, and a lecture
on Africa by Mrs. Hibbard Kline.

The emphasis on knowledge about the Univer-
sity is important, according to Mrs. Seymour, “be-
cause when wives aren’t going to school, they
don’t know very much about it, We feel as though
we are part of the University and want to do
something for it.”

As a service project, the group plans to contact

ordinator of the Previews.

the wives of graduate students coming to the Uni-
versity next year. “We would like. to take some
of the burden off the individual departments by
helping these new students ﬁnd housing and in-
troducing them to others with similar interests.
I think it would be good to contact these people
before they come here to make them feel as
though they have a friend in Pittsburgh,” Mrs.
Seymour explained.

The group is an excellent way to meet peo-
ple with similaninterests and problems. Other
smaller social groups have sprung from the organi-
zation. According to Mrs. Seymour, “Several ‘bridge
clubs have been started and several groups go to
the Symphony on Friday evenings. Many wives
get together over coffee during the week.”

Most of the women, like Mrs. Seymour, have
several children. She divides her time between
her husband, a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics
Department, three children, and a part-time job
in Carnegie Museum.

Mrs. Seymour began her term as president in
January and will continue until August when she
expects to leave the University. Before August the
group’s program chairman and social chairman
will also be leaving because their husbands are
ﬁnishing their work here,

These are examples of the constantly chang-
ing character of the organization. New members
join each month as old members leave. Although
this changing nature might be considered a stumb-
ling block by some, Mrs. Seymour feels other-
wise. “It’s always hard to get any organization
started, but once you have begun» with a few will-
ing workers and a real purpose, the going becomes
easier.”

As an example Mrs. ‘Seymour discussed the
chapter of Dames, an undergraduate and grad-
uate student wives organization, at Michigan State
University, which is so large that it had to split
into four groups. -

The Pitt Graduate Student Wives Association
and Carnegie Institute of Technology’s Dames of-
ten meet together. “After all,” Mrs. Seymour said,
“Problems that wives of graduate students face
have no school barriers.”

Applications are being accept-

ed for chairman and member-

Lectures

Scheduled

Dr. Paul Feyerbend, pro-
fessor of philosophy at the
University of California at
Berkeley, will deliver two
philosophy of science lec-
tures this week. Dr. Feyer-
bend’s lectures, under the gener-
al title “The Problem of the Exis-
tence of Theoretical Entities,”
are sponsored by the University’s
Center for the Philosophy of Sci-
ence.

Tomorrow Dr. Feyerbend will
discuss “Philosophical Aspects of
the Problem,” and Wednesday he
will talk about “Physical Aspects
of the Problem.” Both lectures
will be given in Clapp Hall at
8:15 p.m. _

The lectures will deal with the
question of whether unobserva-
bles in the sciences are to be re-
garded as convenient schemes
for the ordering of human exper-
ience, or whether they may be
said to exist in the same sense
in which tangibles exist.

Born in Vienna, Dr. Feyerbend
has studied history, drama, as-
tronomy, physics, and philosophy
in Weimar, Vienna, Copenhagen,
and London, He has lectured at
the Vienna Institute for Sciences
andthe Fine Arts and at the
University of Bristol. A

The lectures are open to the
public.

In Finals of Eastern Tourney

 

 Being Frank

by FRANK SMIZIK
1 Sports Editor

WHAT WILL THE FUTURE RING?

, The term is coming to an end and the wintersports are
finished. There is noneed to remind a Pitt fan that out of
eight varsity teams in the fall and winter terms there has
been only one winner, the soccer team. What will happen
next year? '

FOOTBALL: There is outstanding material‘ on the
team. They were better than their 3-5 record showed last
year. Dave Hart and his staff are trying to motivate these
players and get them into better shape. Spring practice will
tell more about the latent talent yet to be brought out, but
I can’t see why next years team can’t go 6-4. The players
seem to have a winning attitude.

SOCCER: There is no reason why the soccer team can
not go on winning as it did last season. Coach Bemis always
seems to bring a few good soccer players here every year.
He has a top prospect in Jeff Rosenglick, a sophomore who

"should break into the line-up next year and be the shooter

that Bemis has been looking for for last year’s squad. Soc-
cer will continue to be the consistent winner it has always
been.

BASKETBALL: This is the major sport with the most
serious troubles. Recruiting is the key to the basketball
team's success. This years freshmen team was better than
average, however must become stronger physically to meet
a tougher schedule. The frosh were physically beat at the
end of the season and looked ragged and shoddy. These
freshmen will be the nucleus of the varsity next year. The

— "team is probably still one year away from having a winning

season. .

WRESTLING: It doesnt’ seem to be considered a major
sport anymore. The tournament last weekend showed how
exciting good collegiate wrestling can be. Scholarships will
have to be given out in greater number for the team to be
an Eastern and National power again. This depends on the
financial success of the bootball team. The improvement of
this year’s sophomores should give the team a respectable
record next year.

GYMNASTICS: Is in the same plight as the wrestling
team—scholarships are needed. The team has one Eastern
Champion Dave Shidemantle, and not much else. He will be
able to compete in more events next year as long as he stays
healthy. The team will only stay mediocre, however, until
more men can be given scholarships.

' SWIMMING, TRACK, and CROSS-COUNTRY: These
sports all have the same problems, they are deemphasized.
There only hope is lowering the standards of the schedule
and playing weaker teams. It is the only way they will win
until more money is sent their way.

BASEBALL: This. will be the second winning team for
the year. Coach Lewis has some ﬁne ballplayers, and the
team has a shot at another NCAA Tournament bid. Lewis
is lucky because he gives out very few full scholarships to
baseball players. Many of the athletes who participate in
other sports can also play baseball and therefore many of
the players are on half scholarships for both. This can’t be
done in gymnastics or wrestling.

  

By TOM SACKS
Assistant Sports Editor

For the first time since
the Panthers joined the
Eastern wrestling .associa-
tion in 1954, they have failed
to produce an Eastern cham-

pion. It came as a surprise
to none.

What did come as a surprise
were the performances of Clair
Riley and Jack Williams. In the
two day marathon at the Field
House, Riley (152) stunned every-
body by advancing into the ﬁnals
where he bowed to Dick DeWa1t
of Penn State, 5-3.

Williams, a sophomore, estab-
lished himself as the person to
watch in the 191-pound class,
when he made it all the way to
Saturday night’s ﬁnals before
losing to Corne11’s Bob Buchwald.

Coach Dave Johnson was among
those that were most surprised
by Riley's performance. “If any-
one had told me last year that
Riley would be wrestling in the
-Eastern ﬁnals, I would have said
you're crazy,” said Johnson. "I
got more plus ten per cent than
I ever expected to get out of
him.”

In the quarterﬁnals Riley oust-
ed top seeded AI Lilley of Tem-
ple, 10-8. Riley continued his

Lehigh Captures
Team Trophy

InMat Marathon

(Continued from Page 6)
giant killing in the next round
when he decisioned another fav-
orite, Ed Franquemont of Har-
vard, 5-1, in overtime. -

His opponent in the ﬁnals, De
Walt, had trounced Riley, 10-2, in
an earlier dual meet. Saturday’s
match started off the same way.
Going into the third period De-
Walt was leading, 3-0. Riley man-
aged to escape after 20 seconds
and from that point on kept strug-
gling for a takedown. His efforts
ﬁnally paid off when with 11 sec-
onds remaining he picked up two
points for the much needed take-
down. -

DeWalt pulled himself out of
bounds. Then with four seconds
left, all Riley had to do was hang
on in order to send the match
into overtime. But he lost his
grip and ,DeWalt managed to
swing around on top to clinch
the Eastern crown.

Williams’ brute strength was
equally impressive. He scored a
fall over his first round oppon-
en_t. His seeding then matched
him up with second seeded Guido
Carloni in the quarterﬁnals. Car-
loni had pinned Williams in their
dual meet at Navy.

This time it was all Williams
when he shocked Carloni in a
13-8 decision. He advanced to the
ﬁnals by pinning Hugo Croft of
Army at 3:46. His opponent in
the ﬁnals, Buchwald, was also
the favorite.

’Williams’ powerful arms con-
tinued their dominance in the
first period. He took Buchwald
down twice and was leading, 4-1,
at the close of the period. Then
all of a sudden the fatigue of two
days of constant wrestling hit
him. Buchwald spent the rest of
the time pushing Williams around
the mat, ﬁnally pinning him at
7:46.

The only other Panther point
gatherer was Cliff Zolikoﬁ, who
ﬁnished in fourth place in the

137-pound class. As a team, the
Panthers ﬁnished seventh in the
16 team ﬁeld with 31 points.

Lehigh walked away with ﬁrst
place with 85 points compared to
Navy’s 63. ‘The Engineers had
three champions and two runner-
ups. The new reigning champs
are Mike Caruso (123), Joe Peri-
tore (130), Wayne Hicks (137),
Bob Robbins (145), DeWalt (152),
Jeff Stephens (160), Jon Rushatz
(167), Fran Ferraro (177), Buch-
wald (191) and Paul Goble
(heavyweight). Caruso and Steph-
ens are the only repeaters from
last year.

The best match of the tourna-
ment and possibly the best of the
season was the 1-0 overtime win
of Hicks over Lehigh’s Bill Stuart,
the defending 137 champ. The
two had drawn, 7-7, in their dual
meet earlier in the year.

At the close of their match,
Hicks was leading 2-1, but the ref-
eree, in a debated call, gave
Stuart one point when he cited
Hicks for stalling. The match
went into overtime. The ﬁrst per-
iod ended 0-0. In the second per-
iod Hicks quickly escaped from
the down position. With Stuart
down in the closing period, Hicks
draped himself all over Stuart
and rode him till the end.

HahnfeldtPlaCcsSecond
In ECSC Diving Event

By GEORGE LIES
When coach Ben Grady took three members of the
swimming team to the Eastern Collegiate Swimming Cham-
-pionship at Annapolis, Maryland last weekend, he did not
expect them to perform great feats of strength and come

away all winners.

Entering only three participants
in the meet, Grady could not even
expect enough points to place in

, the top ten even with all winners

(with 31 points, Pitt ﬁnished
13th). However, he was satisﬁed
with the performances of Don
Hahnfeldt and sophomores John
Lane and Joe LeViere.
Competing in his second ECSC
tournament against 32 other div-
ers, Hahnfeldt just missed win-
ing ﬁrst. place in both the low
board and the high board events.
“In the low, Donnie. lost by three
or four points to (Pete) Hibbard
from Rutgers,” Grady said. In the
high dive, Hahnfeldt lost by eight
points to Mike Chapman of Navy.
Lane swam in the 1,650-yard
freestyle besides competing in
the 200 and the 500—yard dis-
tances. “His time of 19:01 in the
1650 was 27 seconds below the
time we turned in for him,”
Grady said. Lane’s time gained
him the eighth spot in.a ﬁeld of
37 entrants. Lane placed 14th out
of 49 in the 500 and 15th out of
68 in the 200. '

LeViere., who Grady felt was
“a little bit nervous because of
the big meet,” placed eighth in
the 100-yard backstroke and ninth
in the 200-yarder.
