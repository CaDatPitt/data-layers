For Winter Term

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

IFC Sets Rush Rules

Interfraternity Council (IFC)'
passed a resolution Wednesday
night establishing the rush rules
for Winter term. Formal Rush
will extend from 8 a.m. Jan. 12
to 2 a.m. Jan. 23. There will be
no open rush period next term.

One major change is that there
will be no dated or combo par-
ties allowed on either of the two
Fridays during rush. Fraternities
are encouraged to have stag af-
fairs on these nights at which
time they could meet and get to
know rushees. V

It was thought that the curtail- “

ing of a period of open rush and
the limitation on the number of
dated parties would reduce the
expense of the fraternities and
the time spent by Greek men
during -Winter Rush to a ﬁgure
proportional to the number of
rushees taking part in the pro-
gram. '

At the same meeting, IFC Pres-
ident Ed .Miguelucci announced
that Lambda Sigma Rho had pe-
titionéd for membership on IFC

and was accepted for a six month
probation period. Lambda Sigma
Rho was formerly recognized un-
der the name of LASERS but will
now be considered a Greek or-
ganization.

MDC Gets

Account

Tuesday’s Men’s Dormitory
Council (MDC) meeting was high-
lighted by the establishment of a
University account for MDC
alone. Currently,_ MDC shares its
Schenley Hall account, which has
delayed the distribution of mon-
ey to the respective housing units
and the plan for MDC’s Dorm-'
Weekend, which is scheduled for
late February. V

MDC’s bill concerning policy for
the Tower's Lobby was -brought
up for approval to be incorpor-

ated into University policy. This L

By NANCY FUCHS
Dr. James A. Kehl, dean of the

liberal ‘arts, brought students up ‘

to date with the progress of the
Liberal Arts Executive Council
at an open meeting of. Project

*.»Teach Wednesday. Dr. Kehl told

approximately 35 students at the
YMCA-sponsored meeting in Tow-
er A that the Council has come
up with a general proposal for
changes in distribution require-
'ments. '

Stressing that the proposal is
not deﬁnite, he explained that
under it the 15 credit distribution
requirement in each discipline

‘ would be taken in a minimum of

three instead of ﬁve departments

student could take two courses in
each of two departments and one
in anotherdepartment in the hu-
manities, social sciences, and nat-
ural sciences. ‘

The individual departments will
make their own rules as to what
courses may be taken for distri-
bution. Dr. Kehl explained that
a department might permit a stu-
dent to. take an 80’s course and

then a core course for his second
one in the ﬁeld. Under such a

a program, sequential courses like

Chemistry 11 and 12 would both
count for distribution credit.

“This will take some registra-
tion from the 80’s courses and
spread it around to other courses,”
Dr. Kehl said.‘Thus it will mean
some changes in room sizes. If
we can get‘ the right sized rooms
and if the departments can make
any necessary course changes in
time, “hopefully this distribution
requirement will go into effect
in September,” he said. I

Dr. Kehl explained. that he.
wants all of theidepartment chair-
men and the Liberal Arts Cabinet
to look over the proposal before
anything deﬁnite is done. “The
hard fact is that we_ aren't going
‘to.  any changes until <I’m.

K

ments. There will not be change
just for the sake of change,". he
said. ' C

There ‘are a number of dead-
lines which have to be met,. ac‘.
cording, to Dr. Kehl. A new Lib-
eral Arts Bulletin has to be print-
ed soon, and department chair-

men have to present their time

schedules for the spring and fall
by Dec. 27. »
In its weekly meetingthe Coun-

" oil has discussed such questions

as whether or not the distribu-
tion requirement should be
waived in the discipline in which

_ his major‘ subject ‘is found. Thus
an English major would not have

to take any humanities distribu-
tion courses. The reasoning be-

vhind it is that students would

be encouraged to take. courses
that would rel-ate well to. their
major subject.

- The Council has set up a num-

-ber of committees, ‘of which each‘

chairman is a member of the
Council. The Committee on Su-
perior Instruction, under Dr. John
Townsend, associate professor of
physics,_ will consider giving
awards for god teaching.

Dr. Kehl said that he would
like to write letters to students
after they graduate to find out
which professors had a great in-
ﬂuence on them. He would ask
graduates to point out the suc-
cesses as well as failures in the
education they received here.

V The Committee on Academic
Status, chaired by Dr. Kehl, has
conﬁned its discussion to proba-
tion thus far. The Council also
hopes to form a Committee on
Admissions and Advanced. Stand-

ing and one on the Honors"  .

of Learning.

Since the women’s dormitory will be 950 beds short for Septem-
ber, 1966, freshmen class, the new regulations are a necessity, said
Mrs. Anne Ginevan, head resident of Tower C. “This is not a solution-I
to the problem but a step in the right direction,” she explained. A

When questioned, Mrs. Ginevan; Mrs. Janette Peat, head resi-A
dent of Brackenridge Hall; and Mrs, Mary Alice Herbert, head resi-
dent of McCormick Hall, said they did not know how many girls
would live off campus. Senior women over 21 years of age were al-
lowed, to live off campus this year but _only four are doing-~-so;ff1“_‘. .

The head residents agreed that there are not enough suitable?
apartments in Oakland for a large number of women to ‘live oiftf

campus.

“Girls of this age can fend for themselves. Every girl who wants’
the opportunity to live off campus should have it,” Mrs. Peat said
She felt if the ﬁrs/t year were a success more women would live

off campus the second_ year.

Housing Board has also instituted a dormitory-wide 
I Board. This board, proposed during the spring trimester, will be eﬁect-__
tive next trimester. The purpose of the board is to have a “mor

uniform system of regulating cur-
fews and infractions in all wom-
en’s residences under the juris-
diction of Housing Board.

The decisions made by the dor-
mitory-wide Penalty Board would
concern infractions of the pre-
ceeding week, and appeals on the
standard infraction penalties.
A Conﬁdential matters would be de-
cidedt by the head residents. -

-Viet Policy

Individuals that oppose United
“States policy in Vietnam have a
right to speak and those who sup-
port it have an obligation to
“make unmistakably clear” the
“ﬁrm commitment" of the United
States, according to a statement
signed by 104 national ﬁgures.
Signers included former Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon, for-
mer Secretary of State Dean
Acheson, and former _military
governor of the U.S. zone in Ger-
many, retired Gen. Lucius D.
Clay. _ ' ’
The statement, circulated about
two weeks ago, was prepared by
ﬁve leaders of private education-.
al and service agencies and cir-
culated by Freedom House, a
‘nonpartisan educational center.
“This is no longer merely a
question for domestic debate over
national policy,” the statement

said. “Across the world, friend
and foe alike are watching in-

our national purpose.”

“The censensus, which is’ clear
to all experienced observers, must
not be obscured by the behavior

"of a small segment of our pop-
ulation. They have a. right to be
, heard, «but they impose on the

 cream the nation’:

Of Great Oil Rush Days

Once men and women flocked to the city of Titusville
with the prospects ‘of finding oil. The gold rush in California
was violent with men fighting for their lives to stake a

claim.

The oil rush was no less dramatic in this community.
One hundred years ago, at the height of the oil rush, a
farmer would wake up in the morning with oil gushing from
his property and would be dead by evening, the victim of a

Zavacky, Titusville Instructor, ,Hopes
To Stir Interest In Political Science’

The Titusville community
is aware of the impact of the
University upon its affairs.
Spokesman from the Titus-
ville campus have brought a
broad approach in social as
well as government affairs.
The following. article appear-
ed in the Titusville news-
paper:

“Democracy will beneﬁt from

tion, controversy and debate,"
according to Michael Zavacky, in-
structor of political science at
Titusville. “Any actions that pro-
mote this would be beneﬁicial to
the promotion of democratic gov-
ernment," he said. «

“I have the strong feeling that

apathy generallyresults primari- ,

ly from the one party structure
of rural government, that peo-
ple generally go along with the
party by tradition. They accept
and it becomes entrenched. They
fear protesting in any way.

“My. experience in city and
urban politics leads me to be-

lieve that participating in voting, '

public criticism and debative is-
sues is much more prevalanet.
This happens in spite of Demo-
cratic machines which generally
dominate urban governments.
“I would imagine because the

’ metropolitan press is much more—

critical of one-partyism and ma-

chine politics than the rural press
is of machine politics, localand
rural voters seem to be concern-
ed with ‘tradition,” Zavacky said.

“I--yarn hoping to stir interest
in political science and I am con-
cerned with individuals and is-
sues more than the single party

. vote.”

Zavacky is a graduate of Penn-
sylvania State University with
an M:A. in. political science and
is a graduate of the graduate
school at the University. V

He is presently working on his
doctorate andhis dissertation.

He. has been an instructor at
_Titusville for three years.

   
  
 
  
   
    
   
    
  
  
   
  
 

 Opening game wins are al-
' ways good, even against Car-
negie Tech, and the Panther
basketball team has the vic-
“tory in the books as they
travel to Kent State for their
first away game of the season

tomorrow night.

_ Jim 'LaValley may have come

into his own Wednesday night
against Tech.- He was instrumen-

 as the Panthers hung on for

 54-51 victory. LaValley shot

-for nine from the foul line in

scoring. 15 points. ’

V ‘Foul shooting saved the hoop-.
sters/ from an opening game de-

feat. They hit for an incredible

792 per cent (22-24) at the line

compensate for a dismal 29 per

cent from the ﬁeld.

~“It was foul shooting and de-

jfense that won for us,” said

coach Bob Timmons. “LaValley

great defensive game, with six

Szykowny __was high man for
the night with 18 points. Most of
them came on jump shots from
right around the key and most
of them came in the second half.

Ken Bollens and Bob Lovett
were the major disappointments
in the win. Bollens managed only
one ﬁeld goal and Lovett had
only two for the game.

“Lovett got in trouble with of-
fensive fouls,” Timmons con-
tinued, “and that cut down on
his points. His best shots are from
in close, backing into the basket”

The Panthers enjoyed a 27-17
half-time lead. They saw it dwin-
die to 50-48 with 46 seconds left.
But two clutch free throws by
Szykowny put the game away.

“That’s why I am generally
pleased about the game,” Tim-

mons said. “Tech has a trouble- “

to the pressure. This shows in

'1 ber of credits, could live off-campus. "

‘ On November 15 there was a panel discussion on the merits of allowing und r-
graduate women to live off campus. The panel was moderated by then Dean of Women
5 "Helen P. Rush and two women students each on the pro and con side of allowing some
‘ form of off-campus living. I a .

’ At this discussion and throughout last year the main arguments were that the Uni-
, lversity had a responsibility to look out for the welfare of women undergraduates, espe-

~ cially freshman, and that corporate living did not necessarily deny freedom. .
The other side argued for liberalization of housing regulations saying that the goal
of a liberal arts education is to produce respnsible, mature citizens and that students
become mature only by assuming responsibilities——notably, those involved in living off
campus. V
After such ‘discussions the changes made in this year's housing rules were that (1)
any women senior undergraduate 21 or over by September, 1965, may live off campus and
7 .. (2) establishing honors suites open to seniors and free of curfews. »

, Last year there was not a shortage or anticipated shortage of women’s housing.

’ It was ﬁscally proﬁtable and physically possible to have all women undergraduates liv-
’ ing in University dorms. , .

Enter 1965. Two events occur during the fall trimester. First, the University
realize it will be about 950 beds short for women’s housing next year. Second, Women’s
Housing Board proposes a new rule allowing women with 60 credits or more to live off-
campus with their parents’ permission. , ‘

Dean of Women and the head residents back the proposal. As Mrs. Anne Ginevan,
head resident of Tower C said, “This is not a solution to the problem (housing) but a
 step in the right direction.” ’ . 1
Mrs. Janette Peat, head resident of Brackenridge Hall, said, “Girls of this age
can fend for themselves. Every girl who wa nts the opportunity to live off campus should

have it.” «

We can only‘ wonder if the change inhousing rules and the housing shortage were
isolated events. It seems that the liberalization of rules may not primarily be a recogni-
tion of women students’ rights, but a matter of fiscal and ‘physical necessity.

Engineering Dean Explains
Accreditation Loss in Dept.

Editor, The Pitt News:

On November 12 the Chancellor received the report of the En-
gineer’s Council for Professional Development (ECPD) on the sub-
ject of Engineering at the University. This report was written from
conclusions reached by a nine man, inspection team which visited
the School of Engineering in March of last year and from a variety
of data submitted to that group since that inspection on changes which
have subsequently been made. ,.

The report is one of the most favorable received by the School
of Engineering in recent years. Six programs within the school were
reaccredited for four years and two were given a two year accredi-
tation with the indication that a letter-report on certain minor speci-
ﬁc matters would suffice to have this extended for another two years
if submitted at the end of the two year period. Only chemical en-
gineering was denied accreditation at this time.

_ The ECPD report then noted “with approbation the changes that
has directed a major part of its effort during the past few years to
developing and strengthening parts of the institution other than
engineering. This is true and engineering now enjoys association with
and depends upon areas throughout the University which are aca-
demically notable. The report then notes that-— i

“It now appears that longawaited action to develop the poten-
tials of the school is getting underway. Major indications of this in-
clude: appointment of a new dean of the school; the planning of a
new engineering building which has reached an advanced stage and
provisions by the state for funding its construction; and active efforts
to select several new department heads.” » S‘ ,

The ECPD report then noted “with approbation the charges that
have been made since the visitation” and added that “those which
provide for added leadership "through several new appointments are
particularly noteworthy.” The report praises our various curricula,
noting that these have been “effectively revised to provide suitable
balance,” and again that the curriculum is a “modern, well-balanced

one of good quality,” “up-to-date.” The teaching is referred «to as-

“dedicated,” “conscientious” while the faculty is referred to as “well
equipped for its task,” “competent”? and .“well qualiﬁed.”

The report further comments on our presently crowded condi-
tions, laboratories which are minimally adequate, and equipment
which, because of the laboratories cannot always be‘ used to maxi-
mum effectiveness. However, it notes with enthusiasm, that the new
engineering building will change / all this and add new dimensions
to the entire school. 1/

With all this praise, why the action on chemical engineering?
The report on this department starts with the statement already
quoted in The Pitt News to the effect that— '

“The department has made signiﬁcant progress in several areas
since the last ECPD evaluation. A competent staff has been assem-
bled which is capable of presenting a well-balanced, ‘modern pro-
gram in chemical engineering. '

It then goes on to dwell on a seriesnof problems which were
those very problems to which Professor Edward Stuart addressed
himself immediately upon being appointed chairman, Aug. 1. .Prob-
lems we do have . . . no one denies this . . . and chemical engineer-
ing has no monoply on them. However, we also have clear paths to
solutions of these problems and a ﬁrm commitment from the admin-
istration of this institution that they will support our every effort to

resolve them. Indeed, in general, we know that this University 

committed to the need for a ﬁrst rate School of Engineering and this
is our goal . . . in chemical engineering and throughout the school.
What, then, of the immediate future? The action not to re-

.accredit chemical engineering will have only one discernible effect

on our graduates . . . namely, those who wish professional registra-
tion in Pennslyvania will have to take the EIT examination. This is.

strongly recommended in any case——it has always been strongly rec- ,

ommended—and does not work any great hardship "on our graduates.
The same graduate schools will be open to them and I can assure
them that industry will interview and employ as in the past. "We
will be seeking a re~evaluation by ECPD at the earliest possible mo-
ment . . . probably} in the spring of 1967 and I am conﬁdent of the
outcome of that inspection. By then our curriculum planning, our
staff development programs and the new building construction will
have visibly effected not only the chemical engineering department
but all departments throughout the school.

I feel these facts help supplement your front page treatment of '

the decisions with regard to chemical engineering which ignored the
positive‘ and complimentary actions ‘taken throughout the ‘remainder
of the school. We are not just a collection of. individual departments
but a school in which all participate to provide the best possible edu-
cation for students who wish to engineers. The profession in ch’ang-
ing, growing——-as rapidly as is our society.'I think this present prob-

Cagers VisitKent State Tomorrow;
. Try for Second Victory of Season

By [JAY ROSENSTEIN

A" Filled to capacity before it
was built. That is the history
of the ﬁrst dormitory for
resident students on the Ti-
tusville Campus.

~ Administrative officials of
Titusville are already plan-
ning to build a second dormi-

tory behind the present one.
. Early in the year, Dr. Joseph
Ball, president of the Titusville
campus, and Dr. John Geise, vice-E
chanceloor of regional programs,
, realized the need for facilities to
. house out-of-town students.
, In April, 1965, the decision was
.- made to construct the building.
Within four months, barely in
time for the beginning of the
.0 fall trimester, the building was
’ completed. One hundred and ﬁfty-
four men and women signed for
Urooms to ﬁll the -dormitory. An
additional 42 are living at the
YMCA and in private housing in
‘V the city.
The dormitories were built and
 equipped by a ﬁrm designated as

Frosh Whip Tech J.V.’s

Despite Poor Shooting

Tim Grgurich’s highly touted
freshman hoopsters opened their
season with a convincing, 66-37,
victory over the Carnegie Tech
J.V.’s, Wednesday night at the
Field House.

Tech was never really close to
the Cubs, and after ten minutes
the frosh led, 21-9. Using a tight
man - to - man defense combined
with a full court press, the hoop-
sters held Tech scoreless for the
next ﬁve minutes while ﬁve play-
ers combined to add 12 more
points to the Cub scoring column.

“Our shooting was a little off
(28-78, 36 per cent) because we
haven’t .practice.d too much. We
had a light workout the day after
the Varsity game and then only
one practice after Thanksgiving
vacation,” explained Grgurich.
“Our defense is real tough, though,
and ought to win a lot of games "for
us. We’ll be using an aggressive.
man-to-man defense all year with‘
' a lot of double-teaming as well as
a, wide open oﬁense.”

The Cubs’ wide open offense
showed some signs "of sputtering
late in the ﬁrst half, and follow-

I ing Dave We1ty’s basket with
about 16 minutes left in the
game, the frosh went ﬁve min-
utes without a ﬁeld goal, scoring

only on three foul shots by Wel-
ty. Fortunately, Tech could only
manage six points during this
period.

Welty led all Cub scorers with
11 points while Len Kalata scored
nine, all in the ﬁrst half. Barry
Hummel, a sometimes Varsity for-
ward, led Tech’s J.V.’s with 14
points.

Coach Grgurich reﬂected that,
“some of the boys are still hav-
ing problems adjusting from high
school. (Frank) Clements, for ex-
amp1e—you can see he’s got good
moves, he’s just not used to play-
ing with four other good play-
ers.”

Coach Warren Neiger takes his
15 man gymnastics squad to Am-
herst, Massachusetts, tomorrow
to- open its season against the
University of Massachusetts.

‘ Last year, the Panthers started
their 5-5 year by edging tomor-
row’s rivals, 661/2-511/Q. Starters
for the various events were de-
termined by an intrasquad try-
out meet at Trees Hall, Nov. 30.

“Massachusetts is stronger than

last year, and we should have a

rough time,” explained coach
Neiger. “We should have a hard
time on the high bar and the par-
allel bars.” '

The Panthers’ main hopes lie
in captain Dave McKinnis, ﬂoor
exercise, side horse, still rings,
and parallel bars; Jim Sacco, who
ﬁnished sixth in the East last
year in the all-around; and sopho-
more Dave' Shidemantle. ﬂoor
exercise, trampoline, and long
horse. 7

The Bell System has many small, automatic
telephone offices around the
country.The equipment in them

could operate unattended ‘for
ten years or so, but for a problem.

The many electric motors in those offices
needed lubrication at least once a year. Heat
from the motors dried up the bearing oils,
thus entailing costly annual maintenance.

To stamp out this problem, many tests
were conducted at Bell Telephone 1
Laboratories; Lubricant engi- '
neer George H. Kitchen decided
to do. a basic experiment that
would provide a motor with the
worst ‘possible conditions. Hedeliberately set _



   

out to ruin some ball bearings

by smearing them with

, icky guck called molybdenum,

disulfide (MoS2).

Swock! This solid lubrica_nt, used a certain
way, actually increased the life expectancy
' of the ball bearings by a factor
of ten !. Now the motors can run‘
for at least a decade without

 

- lubrication.
