Job availability, not higher

education, focus of candidates

Lauren Bauschard
For The Pz'tt_News

A stagnant economy and ballooning national
debt have placed funding for higher educa-
tion on the back burner for President Barack
Obama and challenger Mitt Romney’s stovetop
of issues.

While funding for higher education and
plans for dealing with student debt might
seem among the most important topics to
cash—strapped students, neither candidate has
given these issues much focus leading up to the
Nov. 6 election.

“Zachary Auter, a graduate student in Pitt’s
Political Science department, said the candi-
dates are focused on issues right now that are
going to win the election, and higher education
isn’t at the top of the list. A

“We have to keep in mind that a candidate

isn’t going to win an election on education pol-
icy, ever,” Auter said. “There is no evidence of
an election being won over higher education.”
According to Auter, the issues in this elec-
tion are not necessarily higher-education poli-
cy itself, but the idea of stimulating the econo-
my so that there are jobs available to students
when they graduate. A
“These guys are looking at the polls from
the swing states, and what the issues are there
—— they are focusing everything on that,” Auter
said. “So if it’s not one of those issues, it’s going
to take a back seat.” * '
Auter said that during the debates, both
candidates quickly stated that they were in fa-
vor of higher education — and that everyone

should have the opportunity to attend college

— but then merged into the issue of job cre-
ation for college graduates instead of speaking

Women   voters expected to play
prominent role in election

Student groups are proving that women ‘

are going to be anything but a “silent ma-
jority” this election season.

The members of Pitt’s Campus Wom-
en’s Organization and VOX: Voices for
Planned Parenthood continue to host
events to inform voters about current is-
sues that concern women in the upcom-
ing presidential election. With President
Barack Obama and Republican presiden-
tial candidate Mitt Romney displaying
some drastic differences in their Views
on social issues involvingwomen, Pitt’s
student groups said" they want to make
sure women are informed about the can-
didates so they choose the one that best
suits their needs. .

As Nov. 6 draws near, the student

groups are speaking out about the issues
of women’s rights, discussing the candi-
dates’ drastically different approaches to
solving national issues concerning health

care and urging students to get involved.

in the election process.

Bella Salamone, president of Pitt’s

Campus Women’s Organization,
CWO focuses on efforts to prevent the
nation from allowing human rights to be
considered subordinate to other topics
in this election, such as the economy. The
group’s goal for the academic year is to
achieve some degree of intersection be-
tween gender, race and sexuality, or how
gender inﬂuences other areas of a wom-
an’s life.-l

ON CAMPUS

  

For many Pitt students, election marks ﬁrst time voting for president

Natalie Daher _
F or The Pitt News

Four years ago, Barack Obama
emerged with a fresh, energizing
message of change that attracted
young voters to the world of poli-
tics.

Now, only four years later, as
President Obama faces off against
Republican V nominee Mitt Rom-
ney, many young people are still
teetering between the two candi-
dates only weeks before Election
Day.

Each presidential election

brings a sweep of new voters who '

have matured past the legal age
of 18. These ﬁrst-time voters add
a new ﬂavor to the issues that are
discussed and the opinions that
are made — if they so choose to
participate.

According to Pitt Political Sci-
ence‘Professor Kristen Allen, ﬁrst-
time voters introduce “new blood”
into the electorate. She added that
a fresh set of values and upbring-
ings contribute to the novelty of
the youth vote.

But in Allen’s opinion, this
year’s young voters have “lost
the enchantment” that pervaded
the 2008 election. She said many
young people are simply not inter-
ested. ' V

Political Science professor
Shannon Scotece attributed the
lack of interest to Obama’s incum-
bency and the current state of af-
fairs.

“Young people are facing an
uncertain economy and are just

not as enthusiastic as they were

in 2008,” Scotece said in an email.

_ “Polls show that fewer young peo-

ple are planning to come out for
Obama than last election.”

Nevertheless, Obama
holds the statistical majority of the
youth vote, according to Scotece. ‘

Aderin Falana, an undecided
freshman who plans on applying
to the School of Health and Reha-
bilitation Sciences, said she is still
unsure which candidate will re-
ceive her ﬁrst vote.

“We want Obama out because
of what he has or has not done.
We want a new candidate, .but we
don’t necessarily want Romney, or
mayberwe do want Romney,” Fa-
lana said, referring to fellow youth
voters. “It’s at a stalemate for a lot
of people.’’ i

Another major deterrent for
young voters is their lack of inter-
est in the issues at hand.

“Young people don’t feel like
they need to be involved,” Allen
said. “They don’t realize that every
election, every law and every level
of government affects them.”

Political Science teaching assis-
tant Eric Loepp equivocated young
voters’ disinterest with their reluc-
tance to educate themselves about
the candidates and issues. Even
after that, they must take the time
to register and locate their polling
places.

“People are not anti-voting,”

still ’

Loepp said, referring to young
peoples’ willingness to vote for a
winner in game shows and polls.
“To vote in a political election, it’s
more than just texting an answer.”

Mitch Martin, a sophomore
majoring in Global Management,
acknowledged‘ the new responsi-
bility that comes with the ability
to vote. ,

“It’s a new area that I have to
pay attention to, now,” Martin
said. “When I was younger, I didn’t
have to pay attention as much.”

Since this election could be the
ﬁrst exposure to the election pro-
cess for some voters, the dishon-
esty that exists among candidates
might come as a shock. _

“Younger people don’t have
much knowledge of politics and

' take candidates at face value,” Al-
len said. “[Politicians] do lie.”

And for some students, this A

dishonesty is frustrating.

“It\’s infuriating that they never
give a straight answer,” Falana
said. ~

In some cases, the candidates’
constant evasion of questions has
discouraged young people from
voting. Sophomore Clay Kerekes
‘does not plan to cast a ballot for
this election.

“[The candidates] get asked a
question, and they take the most
roundabout way in not answer-
ing it,” Kerekes said. “I’m not a big
politics fan at all. In my opinion,
not much changes, no matter who
you vote for.”

All in all, the negativity that
has saturated the political adver-
tisements and topics of this year’s
campaign has not been the ideal
ﬁrstimpression for new voters.

Many would agree that the
mudslinging between the candi-
dates has been unappealing, to say
the least. ’

‘‘It’s utterly uncivilized,” Allen
said. During debates, candidates
have been “bickering and cutting
each other off. This turns a lot of
people off.”

Freshman Jillian
echoed this viewpoint.

“Everything surrounding this

election kind of suc ,” she stated.
“I feel at this point, you’re vot-
ing for who you don’t want in of-
ﬁce rather than who you actually
want.”

Grapsy feels “indifferent”
about her ﬁrst election but still
plans to vote.

Despite the lack of interestuor
discouragement from the negativ-
ity, there is still an inherent moti-
vation that drives newly qualiﬁed
voters to exercise their right.

“People usually vote for the
ﬁrst time because they were so-
cialized to be politically active
and/or because they were asked by
someone to vote,” Scotece said.

Students offered a range of
answers regarding w_hy voting is

Grapsy

important to them. But most re- d

sponses surrounded the idea that
it is our “civic duty” as Americans.
“I feel like it’s something you

have to do,” freshman Aidan
Murphey said. “Since we’re given
the freedom [to vote], I thought I
should take advantage.” ,
Social issues such as abortion,
gay rights and women’s rights-have
been a driving force behind new
voters’ decisions. Other promi-
nent concerns include student
loans, health care and the econo-

my.

Democratic voters, such‘ as -

freshman Daniel Lammie, are in-
clined to vote for Obama because
of the health care system Obama
implemented while in ofﬁce. ’_

“My sister — she’s 24 —-and
with Obamacare, she’s still under
my family’s health care. If Obam-
acare were to be rescinded, my sis-
ter would have to pay for her own
health care,” Lammie said. “I’m
worried about health care after
college. I want to have it through
my dad for as long as possible.”

On the other hand, Republican
sophomore Robbie Decker con-.
sidered Romney’s business back-
ground as an optimal trait for ﬁx-
ing America’s struggling economy.

“I ﬁnd it hard to believe why
anyone wouldn’t vote for someone
who’s in business,” he said. “Some—
body who’s obviously been there,
and who knows what it takes to get

. a small business and get us back on

track.”' _
Others do not wish to identify
with either candidate, but rather

New residence hall named’ after Chancellor Nordenberg

Aaron Stier.-Cohen
Stqff Writer

In a surprise resolution, Pitt’s Board
of Trustees named a new residence
hall after Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg, as well as a new scholarship, to
honorhimfor17 transformative years
as Pitt’s leader.

Board member Sam Zacharias in-
troduced the initiative and thanked
Nordenberg for his service at the
Assembly Room of the William Pitt
Union on Friday aﬁemoon.

“Over the course of 17 years as
chancellor and chief executive ofﬁ-
cer, Mark A. Nordenberg, through
a combination of exceptional skills,

broad experience, good judgement,
hard work and the ability to bring
together diverse groups of people, led
the University into the ranks of the
'country’s ﬁnest research universities,
as indicated by student achievement,
growth in research and strength of
donor support,” Zacharias said.
Mark A. Nordenberg Hall, a
10—story building currently under
construction at the corner of Fifth
Avenue and University Place, will
house 559 bedspaces and is sched-
uled to open next fall.
The MarkA. Nordenberg Scholar-
ship Fund is a $5 million endowment
raisedby the board — without Nor-

denberg’s inclusionindiscussions-— '

that will provide income available to
undergraduate students. The Board
ofTrustees didn’t mention the criteria
for students applyingfor the scholar-
ship, but did say it will help Pitt at-
tract more talented and motivated
«students to the University.

Nordenberg was visibly moved '

by the surprise honors, although he
quickly belied his claim of being at a
loss for words.

“When you made me chancellor,
you gave me the greatest gifrl could
have hoped for,” Nordenberg said.
“The job has beenaperfectjob for me.
To be clear: I haven’t done it perfectly,
butl can’t imagine a more rewarding
position.”

. Apart from honoring Norden-
berg, the Board passed only one
other resolution, appointingtwo new
Emeritus Trustees: George Miles Jr.-
and Thomas O’Brien.

The remainder of the hour—and-a-
half-long meeting included updates
about campus planning.

The Property and Facilities Com- <

mittee outlined current progress on
the ﬁve construction projects ap-
proved at ]uly’s meeting, and Nor-
denberg delivered the report of the
chancellor, which detailed student
move-in and Pitt’s 225th anniversary
celebralions. . ,
Alvin Roth, Michael Boninger and
Jennifer Grandis were honored as

distinguished faculty, and the Board

. viewed presentations _on the three

honorees’ recent nationally recog-
nized work. ’ _

Nordenberg also presented all of
the board members with medallions
to honor their roles in Pitt’s progress
as an institution. Board members
rose to greetvarious student leaders,
who presented each board member
with a medallion inscribed with the
board member’s name. ,

“Given its role in building what
some callthe ‘new University of_Pitts-
burgh,’ no group was more deserving
of collective recognition on Pitt’s 225
anniversary than our trustees,” Nor-
denberg said. I

EDUCATION

more on affording a college education.

Pitt is one example of schools around the
country increasing tuition. Currently, Pitt’s
tuition for in—state students is $15,272. Tuition
increased 3 percent for the 2012-2013 aca~
demic year and 8.5 percent the year before.

Obama has been more active than many of
his predecessors in making college more af-
forable. His steps have included expanding the
federal government’s efforts in granting col-
lege loans, increasing aid to community col-
leges and trying to stymie soaring tuition. Yet
with college prices continuing to soar, it’s difﬁ-
cult to assess the effectiveness of his measures.

Information from the presidents of Pitt’s
political advocacy groups demonstrated that
the candidates’ views on the issue of higher
educationucontain only minor variances.

Lara Sullivan, president of Pitt College
Democrats, said Obama’s plan provides equal
access for higher education to all Americans.

“Obama has an excellent record on ensur-
ing that higher education is not a privilege for
the wealthy, but something that is open to all
those who work hard,” Sullivan said.

Casey Rankin, president of Pitt’s College
Republicans, said the need for opportunities
for students after college outweighs the need
for more federal spending on higher educa-

tion.

“The most important thing of higher edu-
cation is that you can get a good, high—paying
job after graduation,” Rankin said. ‘Romney
is turning the economy around, so we can get
jobs right out of college.”

But Rankin also said Romney planned to
maintain the current level of funding toward
colleges, despite his focus onjob creation.

In Romney’s education plan, he said he
would “refocus Pell Grant dollars on the stu-
dents that need them most.” Although many
higher—education proponents took this to
mean Romney would trim down the program,
during the ﬁrst presidential debate, Romney
said he’d focus on maintaining programs that
provide need-based ﬁmding for college stu-
dents, as well as providing jobs for them upon

., graduation.

“We have to make sure that we make it
easier for kids to afford college, and also make
sure that when they get out of college, there is
a job,” Romney said. “I want to make sure we
keep our Pell Grant program growing. We are
also going to have our loan program so that
people are able to afford school.”

The Federal Pell Grant Program provides
need-based grants to low—income undergrad-
uate and certain postbaccalaureate students to
promote access to postsecondary education.

Sullivan said that Obama is putting into
work the importance of higher education by
doubling Pell Grants and establishing a college

credittax. The Pell Grant Program grew from
$14.6 billion given to 6 million‘ students in
2008 to nearly $40 billion for almost 10 mil-
lion students this year. -

One of Obama’s responses during the ﬁrst
debate emphasized the need for an improve-
ment of vocational training at community col-
leges for workers who lost their j obs during the
recession.

“I also want to make sure that community
colleges are offeringvslots for workers to get re-
trained forthe jobs that are outthere right now
and the jobs of the future,” Obama said.

Lisa Pellerito, a sophomore at Pitt, said
that she would pay more attention and better
understand policies in higher education if the
candidates would talk more about it.

“Whenever the candidates are asked about
higher education, they instead talk about job
creation,” Pellerito said. “That’s important,
but I want to know more about what can be
done to make affording college easier.”

Eric Loepp, a graduate student in Pitt’s
political science department, .said Obama has
prioritized his record of job creation over his
higher-educan’on-ﬁmding plans through his
rhetoric this campaign season.

“If, say, Obama comes to Pitt, which is real-
istic, of course he would talk about education,
but what he would be talking about is wanting
to create jobs, and an economy where college
students can get jobs,” Loepp said. “That’s
more of the concern in the election.” I

VOTING

someone who operates under the radar.

Freshman Joe Cutrufelli is attracted to
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, be-
cause he does not advocate for “big govem-
ment.” He feels that there is little distinction
between the two main election candidates,
and neither of their policies appeal to him.

“I really can’t see how either one of them
is different,” Cutrufelli said. “It’s very minis-
cule.”

Whether ﬁrst—time voters support a large-
or small—party candidate, the direction in
which they cast their ballots can deﬁne their
future political standing to some degree.

“[First—time voters] are still develop-
ing their political views and partisanship,”
Scotece said. “The candidate/party that they
choose this ﬁrst time around could help es-
tablish their political identity.”

Establishing this identity can be over-
whelming for those without an extensive
background in politics. But Loepp offered
some advice to young people who are partici-
pating in the voting process for the first time.

“Take ‘advantage of the information out
there, talk to’ your friends and family,” he
suggested. “Learn about issues and candi-
dates. It will make it much easier to wade
through the mess.” I

WOMEN

in the election and want students to be
able to access information concerning the
candidates’ stances on reproductive jus-
tice, which includes the issues of abortion
and health care. .

CWO has been active in supporting
voter registration and compiling a re-
source called “Know Your Candidates,”
which includes a list of information on
its website about all of the presidential,
federal, state and local candidates on the
November ballot in Pittsburgh.

“What matters to us is not that a Re-
publican or Democrat sits in a particular
ofﬁce, just that they support a woman’s
right to choose, to have access to birth
control and health care and to be paid the
same as a man holding the same profes-
sional position,” Salamone said. “It’s easy

to open up Facebook or CNN and see what '

Romney and Obama have recently said
about an issue, but it’s harder for college
students to ﬁnd out how candidates for a
state representative stand on important
issues.” ‘

Jessie Ramey, a professor in Pitt’s
Women’s Studies Department, said that
the women’s vote is not a new issue and
political candidates pursuing women as
a voting block goes back to the origins
of the vote in the 19205 with the 19th
Amendment, which granted women the
right to vote. ~

However, Ramey said there is no such
thing as a women’s vote, because women
are part of diverse communities.

“These candidates realize that they
have to appeal to women in a more com-
plex way and not simply as women, but
both as women and among many other

lines, because women have multiple iden-

tities,” Ramey said. “For example, black
women vote as , African—Americans and
as women. There are different class, eco-
nomic, racial, religious reasons that fac-
tor into the vote besides being a woman.”

Both candidates have been trying to
attract the female vote with ads geared
directly at them, and Democrats continue
to tout the “Republican war on women”
as-part of their campaign to keep Obama

‘ in office. But despite Romney’s slip of the

tongue at the debate with his “binders full
of women” comment, he is proving to be
a contender in capturing a decisive factor
in the election.

According to a recent Associated

Press—GfK poll, Romney has erased -

Obama’s 16-point advantage among wom-
en, with most of his main points geared
toward capturing the women’s vote cen-

tering on how he would ensure a stable '

economy that would, in turn, help fami-
lies ﬁnancially.

Erin Case, vice president of VOX: Voic-
es for Planned Parenthood, said that her
group, which is non-partisan, tries to stay
objective while discussing issues such as
birth control, sexually transmitted in-
fections and other services offered to
men and women by Planned Parenthood.

She said VOX, which has also conducted
campus—wide efforts to get students reg-
istered to vote, is more politically focused
than many groups on campus.

“Obviously, this election is important
in deciding the future of Planned Parent-
hood, so we’re doing our best to talk to
our members about the issues, and en-
courage them to vote,” Case said.

Romney has said he would end fed-
eral funding to the non-proﬁt, arguing
that taxpayer dollars do not need to go
to a group that also provides abortions.
Obama has said that defunding the group
would take away a healthcare provider
that millions of low—income women trust.

According to Ramey, women always
ﬁnd ways to participate within the po-
litical system by propelling grassroots
political and advocacy efforts. Not only
are women not silent, Ramey argued, but
there is no cultural war targeting their
rights. - I

“The idea that the Republicans, or oth-
er politicians, are waging a ‘war on wom-
en’ is a reductionist kind of a view,” she
said. “The issues, such as contraception,
resonate with a majority of people and are
mainstream issues. The title of the silent
majority has been imposed on women,
but they have been anything but silent.”

Case disagreed and said there is a cul-
tural war on women’s access to birth con-
trol and the results of the election will
impact women’s reproductive rights in
terms of abortion and the types of birth
control made available.

Despite the conﬂicting opinions, Sal-
amone argued that if the nation elects
candidates who support defunding
Planned Parenthood and don’t support
the.National Paycheck Fairness Act, it will
face repercussions. She added, however,
that it’s impossible to predict if policy
changes will result. '

“You can’t defund an organization like
Planned Parenthood and expect that the
loss of cancer screenings and gyneco-
logical exams won’t adversely affect all of
your country’s citizens, and not just the
women,” Salamone said.

Ramey said the candidates’ platforms
draw two very different pictures of the
country’s ‘future, and it’s crucial" that
women and young people think through
the issues and vote in presidential, as well
as state and local, elections. '

“After all, women fought so hard and
for so long to win the right to vote,” she
said‘. A '

Salamone said that all Pitt students,
not just the women on campus, have
played a large role in the election process
and will continue to engage in the process
until the official vote in November.

“Every time I hear college students be-
ing called apathetic or disengaged, I want
to say, ‘Look at this campus. Look at°how
many people are running voter registra-
tion and mock debates and informational
sessions,”’ she said. “We have an incred-
ibly active student body, and we shouldn’t
let anyone get away with calling us disin-
terested.” I

can live by this mantra, as should a fe-
male, homosexual, African—American,
Buddhist, low-income—bracket individual.
The main issue to be considered in this
election is thatof equality. Regardless
of an individual’s background, personal

‘ circumstances, or choices, they deserve

the same rights as everyone else.

This is how life goes, says Creedence
Clearwater Revival: “some folks are born,
silverspoon in hand.” Others are not the
“fortunate ones.”

I am a believer of an equal playing
ﬁeld. Don’t turn away from me because
I am a woman. Don’t turn away from my
friend because of the man he loves. Let us
earn our successes by allowing an equal
opportunity to do so to all people in our
country. As citizens of the United States,
we deserve a life free of judgment. My
vote will always be in favor of someone
who values our differences and sees us
as equals.

Elizabeth Weisel
Jobs and an improving economy

When it comes to this year’s presiden-
tial election, I believe the most important
issue facing our candidates is the current
economy, which directly leads to the is-
sue of job creation. Whether you believe
that the government needs to take a more
dominant role in the revitalization of our
economy or you believe that the govern-
ment needs to step back and let the mar-
ket ﬁx itself, the issue is essential.

Particularly because of -our status as
college students, our future depends on
ﬁnding a job after graduation so we can
pay off our student loans and afford basic
living necessities. While the current job
market isn’t quite the emergency situa-
tion it was in the past couple years, it is
still dire for graduates.

Issues involving foreign policy and
global events are important, but I believe
they cannot be dealt with until we’ve dealt
with the increasing problems in our own
country — namely, our failing economy.
The debt itself has to be drawn down in a
responsible way. If it is done recklessly by

gutting spending on progressive research,
infrastructure and education, the seeds
of futureeconomic chaos will be sown.

So whatever your opinion on what the
answer is to this issue, focus in on it and
vote for the candidate you think will make
the most difference.

Tiemoko Ballo I ' —
Quality, affordable education

Several hot—button social issues are
getting the spotlight in this election, but
there’s one critical matter that deserves
more: education. As a tuition-paying stu-
dent at a public institution, education
should be high on your list of deciding
factors for both your own beneﬁt and for
its societal implications. Primary schools
driven by standardized testing metrics

' are failing students and wasting young

minds, and higher education is becom-

ing increasingly exclusive and ﬁnancially
crippling. , _

The U.S. is falling behind the devel-
oped world in educational standards-and
certain industries are forced to heavily
outsource because domestic professionals
are few and far between.«We can’t con-
tinue to undermine the importance of
educational reform; doing so robs our
youth of the opportunity they deserve

and propagates a slew of other societal .
‘issues. You owe it to yourself and your

future children to really examine both

candidates’ stances on education and to -

vote accordingly.

Nick Stamatakis
Growth in entitlement spending

This election should be about protect-
ing our generation. Mitt Romney and
Barack Obama should only have our vote

0

if they can demonstrate they will stand
up for the needs and interests of those

who are under 30. 3

We need afighter. No generation has
entered young adulthood with this much
debt. No generation has entered a job
market with such rough prospects for
people without speciﬁc technical training.

Most critically, no generation has ever
been faced with the daunting prospect
of covering retirement costs of an entire
generation; Medicare will consume 8 per-
cent of the national economy by 2050,
up from 3 percent today. The 5 percent
drop in GDP for the rest of us is’ typically
considered a recession, and this is the
future we will face without any change.

This change will require real leader-
ship. Beneﬁts will need to be cut. Taxes
will need to be raised. The candidate who
can most realistically solve this problem

is the one who deserves your vote. I

Mason completes improbable comeback

Linebacker returns to starting line

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

As the Pitt football team’s defense lined

up to face the Buffalo Bulls on Saturday, '

Oct. 20, it did so with a middle linebacker
who hadn’t started in a game in more
than two years.

After suffering a devastating knee in-

jury in a matchupagainst Miami (Fla.) in V

2010 —- just the third game of his sopho:

-more year —— Dan Mason ﬁnally returned
to the Panthers’ starting lineup in the .

20-6 victory over Buffalo... ‘

“It felt great,” said Mason, who prior
to his injury was expected to anchor the
Pitt linebacking corps throughout his
college career. “Two years was a long

 

time. This is what I’ve been working for.” .  _ . .. --

Pitt first-year head coach Paul Chryst
missed the majority of Mason’s rehab,
and by the time Chryst started at Pitt,
the redshirt junior linebacker already

. had his sights set on playing again, no

matter what the doctors told him.
“He’s been in the. conversation since

I ﬁrst got here,” Chryst said. “This was

his first start..He was pnoductive.” Ma-

son finished with 11 tackles against the j 51-  

Bulls and followed up that performance
by recording 10 more tackles, starting in

Pitt’s dominating‘ win over Temple last . l

 THAT

Transformed Sunseri leads Pitt to resounding

Quarterback /oaoing impressive senior year with Pantkers

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

I still remember the evening vividly.

The. date was Nov. 25, 2011 — the night
of the 104th, and last, scheduled Backyard
Brawl football game between the Pitt Pan-
thers and the West Virginia Mountaineers.

After Pitt jumped out to a 17-7 halftime
lead, I stood up from my seat in the press

box and joined the line- for the restroom. I’ ll '

never forget the conversation Ioverheard
between two gentlemen wearing West Vir-
ginia attire.

“We’re going to win this game,” the one
said. “Pitt doesn’t know how to play with a
lead.”  _

“I agree. You can tell Sunseri is already
getting nervous,” the other responded,

suggesting that Pitt quarterback Tino Sun-
seri would struggle in the second half. “It’s
only a matterhof time.”

They were right.

I proceeded to witness Pitt blow its
fourth double-digit advantage of the sea-
son as the Panthers scored only three
points in the .second half, losing a 21-20
heartbreaker. I

And to say Sunseri struggled would ‘be
an understatement. The quarterback took
an unfathomable nine _sacks in Pitt’s ﬁnal
25 plays from scrimmage, and he seemed
frozen with fear at times.

After the game, Sunseri still appeared
shaken‘ up, telling reporters that he knew
he needed to throw the ball away. .

His then-head coach, Todd Graham
failed to hide his frustration.

“We are playing so good in so many ar-
eas, and then there are just a few areas that
are absolutely killing us,” Graham said,
taking an obvious jab at his quarterback.

In that moment, I feared for Sunseri.

I feared that his legacy would be the

V quarterback who single-handedly blew the

ﬁnal Backyard Brawl for Pitt. I feared that
he would never be accepted by his coaches,
players or fans. And I feared that a talent-
ed, well-spoken kid would never emotion-
ally recover from that traumatic night.

Now, almost an entire year later, Sun-
seri is no longer that nervous quarterback
who ﬁnds the ball glued to his right hand
when games come down to the wire or his
_team loses momentum.

The grayness engulfed Heinz Field.

. The weather — cold and overcast --
reﬂected the sedate mood of Pitt’s ﬁrst Big
East win of the season, which came easily,
47-17, against Temple on Saturday and was
secured by halftime.

The Panthers (4-4, 1-3 Big East) went
into the break leading the Owls (3-4, 2-2
Big East), 31-7.

Temple head coach Steve Addazio was
frustrated by how his team began the con-
test. A

“We gave up some obviously tremen-
dously big plays, fast-hitting plays,”

Addazio said. “We started out that game
as poor as you would want to.” V E-'3

. The Owls, at times, looked reminiscen
of their former Big East selves, who got
booted from the conference after the 2004
season because they couldn’t compete. On
this day, they were overmatched by the
Panthers in all facets of play.

The Panthers’ offense especially domi-
nated the day’s proceedings. _
Senior running back Ray Graham moved
to ﬁfth on the school’s all-time rushing list
with 2,849 yards, passing current Phila-

delphia Eagle LeSean McCoy. Graham re_- _

corded 140 yards on the day and three total
touchdowns.

“I thought today he cut it loose,” Pitt
head coach Paul Chryst said of Graham. “He
was calling for the ball. He’s feeling better,»
and he knows werneeded him to be good.”

Junior wide receiver Devin Street set a‘:
new career high with 140 receiving yards,
but he said that he didn’t even realize it
until someone told him after the game.

Chryst challenged any notion that he or
his team thought of the game as a forgone

conclusion beforehand. , ‘-

“You never want to take anything for "i
granted. I’ve always been like that,” he said.
“You never go into a game thinking ‘boy,
this is what we’re going to do.’ I think you
do that, you disrespect the game. It doesn’t
just happen, and that-’s why I’ve never been
one to expect anything.” ‘I

SUNSERI

After taking more sacks than any

, . ‘other passer in college football and

throwing more interceptions than
touchdowns last season, Sunseri’s
transformation into a solid quarter-
back for ﬁrst-year head coach Paul
Chryst and the Panthers is complete.

And on Saturday afternoon

' ‘against Temple, he was incredible.

In the Panthers’ dominating 47-
17 triumph at Heinz Field — their
ﬁrst Big East win this year —— Sun-
seri heard cheers from many of the
same Pitt fans who booed the quar-
terback throughout much of last
season.
Just like in that fateful West
Virginia game last November, Pitt
jumped out to a 17-7 advantage in
the second quarter. But instead of
collapsing on offense, the Sunseri-
"1ed unit controlled the game for all
four quarters, ﬁnishing with 528 to-
tal yards. ’
His impressive 321—yard, three-
touchdown passing performance
against the Owls now means that
Sunseri has thrown for 13 touch-
downs —— more than all of last
season —— while tossing just two
interceptions, with both of them oc-
curring early in the season.
To his credit, the redshirt senior

has remained humble throughout
this campaign, never heaping praise
on himself or reminding reporters
and fans of how much he has im-
proved.

“I just do my job,” he said after
starring in Pitt’s stunning upset of
Virginia Tech earlier this season, the

His response was even more
modest the next week — when the
Panthers put up 55 points against
Gardner-Webb — as Sunseri cred-
ited his running backs, blockers and
wide receivers for the offensive ex-
plosion.

And after passing the 2,000-
yard mark this season during the
romp over Temple, Sunseri once
again attributed all recognition to

“The offensive line played really,
really well,” he said. “You have to
give credit to those guys.”

But he wasn’t done there.

“It’s a cohesive unit,” he said
of the offense. “Give a lot of credit
to the receivers. And the running

Sunseri even thought that the
coaching staff had a good day. _

“I think they did a great, job of ,

week.”

The guy couldn’t say enough
about his teammates and coaches.

Now, it’s about time for Sunseri
to receive some of the credit, too.

not one of the best quarterbacks in

win the Panthers any games by him-

Temple quarterback Chris Coyer de-
scribed Pitts’ athletic maneuver as having
a demoralizing effect.

“[That] let the air out of the balloon,”
Coyer said of the play by Pitt’s redshirt
freshman cornerback. ‘

With their first Big East victory of the
season behind them, the Panthers’ next
matchup at No. 5 Notre Dame will act as a
real measure of the team’s progress.

.. “It’s going to be a huge week of prepara-
tion before going into South Bend,” quar-
terback Tino Sunseri said.

While Sunseri didn’t think the nature
of the dominant victory had importance
heading into the matchup with Notre
Dame, he admitted that the end result,
itself, did.

“We just wanted to make sure we got our
ﬁrst win in the Big East before November

MASON 

Saturday.

His back—to—back double—digit-tackle
games are even more impressive when
considering the severity of his injury -
devastating doesn’t even begin to de-
scribe it.

On the day of his injury, Mason’s foot
stuck into the Heinz Field grass as a Mi-
ami player came barreling into his knee.
His leg instantly twisted unnaturally
and Mason began screaming in pain as
it became clear that this wasn’t a normal
football injury.

Mason spent about 10 minutes lying
on the ﬁeld before being taken away in an
ambulance, and then his lengthy recovery
began. Undergoing excruciating physical
therapy and multiple operations, Mason
worked daily to achieve his ambitious
goal of returning to the field.

Now, after ﬁve surgeries and almost

from his teammate. 7

“He’s a story,” Thomas said. “Being
out for two years, leg injury, fighting
back. Some people would just give up,
but [Mason] fought back and he came up
big [against Buffalo].”

While Thomas was rehabbing his knee
injury, he received a lot of motivational
talk from Mason.

'“I just told him the same stuff I told

. myself,” Mason said. “He was talking to

me when I got hurt-. So Ijust told him,
‘Keep working and keep your head up.
It’s going to get hard sometimes, but keep
working through those hard days.”’
Now that they are working together
on the football ﬁeld, Thomas still looks
to Mason at middle linebacker any time
he goes to complain about his knee or
legs hurting. _
‘ .  “Dan Mason pushed me. through [prac-

:ti<§e],”>Thom‘as ‘said. “I’m:at p_ractice,‘.anc‘l

two years of intense rehabilitation later,
his improbable comeback is complete.

' Doctors told Mason that he would
likely never run anywhere near his full
speed again, but he doesn’t hold anything
against those doctors. He had his own
desire toget on the field again for the
Panthers, and he did. '

“It ain’t about proving the doctors
wrong; they had to tell me what they had
to tell me,” Mason said. “I’m not going to
listen to that. I want to play football, so
that’s what I’m doing. There it is,”

It’s miraculous that Mason can even
jog out of the tunnel on Saturdays, let
alone play. 1

just to run, he needs a brace. It wraps

around his ankle to keep his foot at a '

90-degree angle with his leg. Due to nerve

damage, Mason’s toes would simply drag

on the ground without his brace.
Because of his remarkable comeback,

Mason has become an inspiration to‘

many, and even his own teammates have
looked to him for strength.

Fellow linebacker Todd Thomas, who
came back this season from an ACL in-
jury he sustained in 2011, is amazed by
