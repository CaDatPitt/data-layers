SGB implements new self-defense seminar

By Kevin Kramer
For The Pitt News

If learning how to defend against violent
attackers does not fully convince University
of Pittsburgh students to attend Wednesday
night’s Self-Defense Seminar, perhaps free
food will.

The entire Student Government Board
spoke with enthusiasm about the seminar at
last night’s board meeting.

SGB President Pro-Tempore Elizabeth
Mania said, “It is a totally revolutionary pro-
gram designed for both men and women.
It’s about empowering one method for self-
defense.”

Mania said the method deals with the

elimination of guilt associated with violent
crimes. The seminar will be taught by
Debbie Gardner, who performs seminars for
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and at
universities throughout the country.

In addition to recruiting Pitt students to
attend the seminar, Pitt’s SGB has helped to
recruit students at surrounding Pittsburgh
universities.

Mania, along with Dennis Donham of the
Office of Student Affairs, said she feels that
the seminar should be a goodwill effort
because it is relevant to all urban campuses.
“We all share the same concerns about vio-
lent attacks,” Mania said.

In addition, Mania said, “It could pay off
for Pitt students to know that Carnegie

Mellon [University], Chatham [College],
Carlow [College] and Duquesne University
are going to include Pitt students in their
activities.” Though Mania hopes the semi-
nar will open doors to neighboring universi-
ties, she, along with other board members,
opened additional opportunities to Pitt stu-
dents by voting to recommend to the
provost to hire a full—time chairperson for
the Women’s Studies Program.

Board member Julie Crowell said, “There
is no Women’s Studies Major. [Women’s
Studies] is not even a department, it’s just a
program.”

Crowell, along with board member Deena
Buchanan wrote a letter to the provost to

Pitt Career
Fair helps

By Jon Hayes
Staff Writer

Yes, indeed, a big part of
our life after college may cen-
ter on competitive careers,
and as we’ve been told, the
spoils of happiness usually go
to the most prepared.

For students who want to
explore different careers or
learn more about a specific
one, Pitt’s Counseling Center
is sponsoring a Career Fair on
today in the William Pitt
Union. -

The‘ Career Fair is an
opportunity for both major-
less first—year students and
self-assured seniors to talk ;
one-on-one with over 100 c
professionals representing
business, health, education,
law and several other profes-
sions, said Career Center
librarian Natalie Rosenbloom.

Oftentimes, students over-
look the opportunities Pitt
offers which assist in career
searches, career counselor
Teddy Fakles said.

“College is a great opportu-
nity to use the resources on
campus and develop a career,

Safely in
assault

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

 

Pitt Office of Public
Safety Director,Rick Boyd
said neither he nor those
involved in the investiga-
tion of the Sept. 10 Pitt-
related sexual assault were
contacted by any member of
the Campus Women’s
Organization.

This remark came after
yesterday’s The Pitt News
reported CWO Co-President
Stephanie Sudzina said
campus police representa-
tives told her the assault
occurred at the Phi Gamma
Delta (FIJI) house.

The article also quoted
Sudzina as saying the fra-
ternity was getting off “with
a slap on the wrist.”

“I’m concerned about
what was said,” Boyd said.
“Nobody contacted me,
nobody contacted my assis-
tant, nobody contacted. the

and the Career Fair is one of
those resources,” she said.

At the door, students will
receive a packet of materials
to guide them through the fair
and it will consist of infom1a-
tion about the professional
representatives and a list of
useful questions students
might ask the representatives,
Rosenbloom said.

By discussing careers with
the fair professionals, stu-
dents should be able to gain a
better understanding of their
own career aspirations, Fakles
said.

mistake of relying on outside

pressures when they decide

This fall when "most students are hitting the books, the
Panther Cycling Club will be hitting the road.

“Our emphasis is a well-rounded club,” said second-year
medical student and president, Dan Latt. Opened to every-
one from the recreational cyclist to the competitive mountain
bike enthusiast, The Panther Cycling Club aims to network
riders, provide instruction and development and promote
men and women’s racing teams.

“In order to be a competitive cyclist it takes a big time
commitment,” said Latt. With an emphasis on racing, the
PCC’s riding schedule covers 150 miles Monday thru
Sunday. I

These members are serious competitors on the bike and in
the classroom. Surprisingly, most of them are medical stu-
dents, or health-related majors. But seriousness aside, these .
students know how to have fun.

captain and nobody contact-
ed the investigators. I’m
trying to find out where
they got their information
from.”

Last night Sudzina said,
“When I spoke to people at
Public Safety they read
exactly what was on the
police blotter.” She said she
and co-president Scott
Dolin found out what frater-
nity was being accused
through their own investiga-
tion.

Sudzina said, “[her state-
ment] was extremely misin-
terpreted. It was just some-
thing we mentioned at the
meeting.

, Few now would raise a voice
against the importance of diver-

sity for the future of higher edu- '

cation. The value of including

people of both genders and of ,

different cultural, racial and reli-
gious backgrounds in the com-
munity, curriculum and class-
rooms of our universities has
been stated repeatedly with
great eloquence and passion.

Precise definitions, objectives .

and strategies for diversity,
however, are the topics of many

. sometimes heated conversations

among campus groups. Who
should be included in diversity
intimacies? By what methods
can we assure ourselves that we
will have anequitable represen-
tation of various constituencies?
How can we best move from a
point of misunderstanding and

- silence toward the goals of
- openness, respectand compe-

tence in a culturally complex
environment? ‘ -
These questions were put
before a broad-based group of
campus administrators, faculty,

not see these issues,

A Diversity Working Group
has been established this year

_for the purpose of responding to

these conversations, giving
advice to the university commu-

the diversity working -group,

aware of the -enormity of the
task of recognizing common

of the university community to

‘provide suggestions for forums

for discussion and plans for
action.

  

Ross Pasquale, president of
the Student Government Board,
isa member of the Diversity
-Working Group. In his opinion,
“the unique interaction on carn-
pus between groups of students
from varying class, cultural,
racial and sexual backgrounds’
provides untapped opportunities
to stimulate learning on the part
of the student body. The
Working Group encourages

Pitt’s Office of Child Development
hosted a family support “Food for
Thought” discussion in the William Pitt
Union last Wednesday. ‘ n

The purpose of the meeting was “to

' raise issues on how the university;

through its resources  teaching philoso-
phies and studentexperiences ..., can cre-
atively support the new movement of
family relations,” said Kathy Rudy,
human services coordinator for Pitt’s

Office of Child Development.‘ Rudy «

organized the meeting and introduced the

panel of six professionals affiliated with’

vaiious "programs supporting families in
Allegheny County communities. I

The panel includ_ed Louise Kaczmarek
from Pitt’s School of Education; Maiy
Carrasco from the School of Medicine
and Family Intervention Center at
Children’s Hospital; David Herring from
the School of Law and Child Welfare
Clinic; Laurie Mulvey, Project Director
of Family Foundations;; Robert Nelkin,
Director ‘ of Human Services for
Allegheny County; and Jerlean Daniel
from the Ofﬁce of Child Development.-

The movement Rudy referred to

involves a fresh approach to dealing with

families in therapy.

The Family Resource Coalition in
Chicago released a paper in March sum-
marizing this newfound approach to sup-
porting families. The paper said family
support programs should be community-

based, family-focused, _ strengths-orient-
ed, user-friendly and culturally sensitive.
The paper also suggested programs pro-
vide universal access and ﬂexibility in
addition to fostering the development of
parental, peer and professional relation-
ships.

Laurie Mulvey stressed in the meeting

that “professionals and families are part- ,

ners” and that those social service
providers need to “ﬁnd and cultivate the
strengths of families to get them where
they want to go.-”

Robert Nelkin shifted the subject dur-
ing the discussion from struggling fami-
lies to teenage issues. He emphasized the
need for programs that focus on prevent-
ing teen violence and pregnancy.

“We’ve (human services professionals)

got to figure out how we can get
involved before kids are abused, before
there is delinquency and school failure,”
Nelkin said.

Not only does Nelkin advocate that
professionals come together to focus on
strategies for dealing with today’s youth,
but he recognizes the value that students
at Pitt can bring ‘to the youth and family
movement. L

Daniel agreed with Nelkin, but also
mentioned the future of the family sup-
port movement lies in the hands ‘of stu-
dents training to enter the field of family
support. She said it is the university’s
responsibility to help students “gain
courage to deal with real issues” that pre-
sent themselves in actual family situa-
tions.

“In no way did we try to
mock the Public Safety
Department.”

Sudzina said she had spo-
ken with Boyd after the arti-
cle had come out and the
two organizations will be
working close together.

“The CWO is very inter-
ested in cooperating with the
IFC (Inter-Fraternity
Council), the Department of
Public Safety and The Pitt
News,” Sudzina said.

Boyd said his biggest "con-
cern was that students would
get the impression Public
Safety was treating the situ-
ation lightly. “My primary
concern is I want the univer-
sity community to realize
we are following up on this
 We’re going to getto the
bottom of this.”

Referring to Sudzina’s
comment about a slap on the
wrist, Boyd said, “This is a
very premature speculation,
and until we actually com-
plete the investigation and
turn the results over  I
don’t know how anyone can
speculate what the outcome
will be.”

In an effort to get the cam-
pus community to report
sexual assaults to campus
police, Boyd recently creat-
ed the “Pitt Police Sexual
Assault Victim Guarantee.”

The guarantee urges the
victim of a sexual assault,
including date and acquain-
tance rape, to report the
incident. The campus police
then promise to:

0 Meet the victim at a place
of their choice to take the
complaint.

0 Not release the victim’s
name.

- Not prejudge the victim.

0 Provide either a female or
male officer to talk to.

- Treat the case with sensi- '

tivity and courtesy.

° Assist in providing med-
ical treatment.

° Assist in privately contact-
ing counseling, safety or
advising resources.

0 Fully investigate the case
and update the victim on the
investigation progress.

0 Continue to be available to
answer questions, explain
the processes involved and
be a listening ear.

Boyd said he talked to his
staff, Pitt Director of "Sexual
Assault Services Mary Koch
Ruiz and different members
of the university administra-
tion before releasing the
guarantee.

“My overriding concern is
that someone will suffer a
sexual assault and not report
it  that to me is a real
tragedy,” Boyd said.

Cycling
°From page I

“Crashing is the phenome-
non of road racing,” said
Collins. He said it is like a
chain reaction —- if one rider
up front goes down, the ones
behind will too.

The “fred of the week,” a
surfing term, is the most
“ignoramus” spill of the
week, and the highlight of
Tuesday meetings. The
“fred” is voted on, and the
winner gets the honor of
wearing the fred T-shirt, a
dirty smelly rag, for a week
of scheduled rides.

“There’s a lot of skin loss,”
said Collins about cycling.
The rider with the most skin
loss earns the title of
“Captain Asphalt.”

The members avoid using
the word “tricks” to describe
some of the technical
skills of mountain bike rac-
ing.

“A mountain bike can go
over things that you
wouldn’t believe,” said
Collins. Frick Park is the
spot for mountain bike train-
ing for the PCC.

the avid cyclists, but Latt

Cycling is not only a sport
but alternative transporta-
tion. The PCC’s advisor,
Dean of the Honors College
Alec Stewart, cycles to Pitt
every day.

The club is not only inter-
ested in fun but also giving
back to the Pittsburgh com-
munity. -

Latt, co-founder, said
coaching the Youth Cycling
League, founded by Pro
Football Hall of Famer
Franco Harris, has become a
favorite project among the
club members.

“[The kids] really learned a
lot from it,” said sophomore
Paul Svoboda.

This year the PCC will be
participating in Ride For The

Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh.

Most notable among these
members is the camaraderie
which Svoboda said is even
more important than racing.
Collins said, “The race
hurts.”

What could have been:
“We welcome you to Game 7 of the 1994 World Series. It has

been an epic matchup, ladies and gentlemen, between the New
York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers as the two most
successful franchises in baseball history have renewed their his-
toric rivalry. The Yankees coasted through the new playoff for-
mat, drumming the hapless Rangers 4-0 and defeating the hard-
playing Indians 4-2. As for L.A. they preferred the dramatic,

However, as we all know, the baseball season wasn’t to be.
But the nightmare may not stop there. Both the NHL and the
NBA are seriously discussing lockouts as the start of their sea-
sons imminently approach. Football is a great sport, but it is
nice to have some variety. Whatever happened to love of the
game and playing for fun? Certainly major professional sports
are businesses, yet there is still something known as the spirit of
competition.

And of course it is the fans who will lose out. We will have to
pay the increased ticket prices to see bloated millionaires throw
spheroid objects around, and we will have to miss the games
and muse on what might have been. Some people may say that,
“if you don’t like it, then don’t go to the games.” Unfortunately
that is what may end up happening. Professional sports are
increasingly alienating their fan base, and if ticket prices rise too
high and pay-per-view becomes the only way to see a game on
TV, then we may eventually see a fundamental change in the
outlook of American pro sports. I '

Arms embargo is wrong

Once again, President Bill Clinton is wafﬂing on a foreign poli-
cy issue, this time the Bosnian arms embargo. Throughout the
entire conﬂict in Bosnian, the Muslim-dominated Bosnian gov-
ernment has been subject to an international arms embargo. This
initially allowed the Serbian forces to roll over them and commit
numerous atrocities. The international community, especially “the

A European nations, have shown an unwillingness to directly

involve themselves in this morass, but believe themselves to have
the moral authority to restrict weapons to the victims of this inter-

] national tragedy.

If the nations of the world are not willing to stop the killing, the
least they can do is level the playing field. Or more accurately,
cease their actions which have created and maintained the imbal-
ance. _

As for President Clinton, he promised during the summer to call
for the cessation of the arms embargo if the Serbians did not agree
to an American-backed peace agreement by Oct. 15. However,
intense pressure by Boris Yeltsin and disagreement by Britain and
France have caused Clinton to scurry for cover, trying to find a
way to wiggle out of his commitment. It is time for Clintonto get
some intestinal fortitude, keep his promise and do what is right.

eing a college student, I
B sometimes lose sight of

things that really matter.
For example, “Do I really
NEED this CD, even though
I’m down to my last $20 that
was supposed to last me the rest
of the month?” As nearly any
peer on campus will tell you,
one’s schedule oftentimes
inhibits one’s good sense
(assuming one possesses sense,
be it good or bad). My own
schedule clouds my sense more
times than enough, and I think it
might be beneﬁcial at this early
stage in the term to distinguish
things that matter and things
that don’t. (Bear with me on
this, OK?)

Things That Matter:

1) Good shoes — I’m sure I don’t
have to tell anyone what blisters
can do to your mood.
2) Pens - I never use pencils.
I’m not saying necessarily that
-pencils are bad, I just always
thought that they suggested a
mistake before one was made.
3) Aspirin - Now don’t get me
wrong, as a rule, I hate pills,
pills of any kind. But after your
fourth class, I’m willing to com-
promise. Besides, isn’t aspirin
supposed to be some sort of,
wonder drug or something?
4) Trees — Trees are swell. They
give you shade, oxygen, some-
thing to lean on, climb, etc.
5) Good moods - No one likes
to put up with people in a bad

mood.
6) Coffee - Those who knowme
know that caffeine courses
through my veins, but coffee
deﬁnes our culture. Even those
who don’t drink it are classified
as “N on-coffee drinkers.”

6a) Mountain Dew - Same
reasons as above; I felt a need to
put this here, just to let mer-
chants who don’t carry
Mountain Dew know my dis-
gust.
7) Booths - Ample room, com-
foitable, need I say more?
8) Poetry — OK, I realize I just
lost half of my audience, but I
believe poetry is essential. It’s
nice, pleasant reading, and that

matters .

9) Crayons - Coloring is fun.

9a) Something to color —
Well, one’s crayons are pretty
useless without material to put
the color on.
10) Reader’s Digest - An activi-
ty book for those over 12. Neat
stories, Quotable Quotes,
vocabulary tests; and it’s small,
durable, read by over 26 million
people  well, something like
that. Anyway, it’s a great publi-
cation.

Things That Don’t Matter:

1) Credit Card Bills - OK, I’m
trying to humor myself.
2) Nifty Shoes That Hurt Like
Hell - What good is looking
good if you’re in agony?

3) Looseleaf - Why do you need ,

it? We’ve got notebooks, and

Columnistlooks at things that matter

they’re much harder to lose.

4) CNN - 24-hour—a—day news?

coverage. I have one question,
WHYI?! ' .

5) Faces of Death 4 - If you’ve
seen the first three, well, I think
that’s all that needs to be said.

6) Remote Controls - I’m not
sure if you live through this, but
at my house, possession of the
remote control denotes some
sort of power. “Oh, Emily has
the remote. Ah-Hem, Emily, can
I get you anything?” Snicker,
snicker.

7) Tabloid TV - I never under-
stood it. This sort of program
baffles me. I never know if I
should laugh, cry. or’ begin
throwing heavy objects at my
television. (Or maybe the view-

er should be the target.)
8) Markers - They seep through
paper.

9) Movie Critics - Who cares
what they think? I mean, really
cares?

, 10) Money - Well, it shouldn’t.

OK, I guess I could go on, but
I won’t. My purpose was simply
to illustrate how we lose sight of
the little things all too often. We
need to keep things in perspec-
tive — we’re only in college
after all — and can’t expect to
change the world. (At least, not
all at once.) ’

Pitt band member defends director

To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in response to the Sept. 6 article “Pitt band members not happy with director.” On behalf
of my fellow peers, not all members of the band are unhappy with O’Neill Sanford.
» I am a fourth-year senior in the band. During those four years I have always been treated with respect,
fairness and discipline. We are not a competition band. We represent our University and our football
team. In order to perform a halftime show every weekend, our shows are constructed in order to accom-
modate the common abilities of each member. .

I joined the band because I like to play an instrument, meet people and travel. I am satisfied with what
the Pitt Band has to offer. People who are not happy may be addressing the wrong issues, perhaps talk-

ing with the wrong people.

The Pitt Band shouldbe a positive organization that projects school spirit and pride. This year the
band is wearing new uniforms. We make at least one road trip in the fall. We attend games for free. At a
large university such as Pitt, these things are hard-eamed. As an organization, we need to appreciate
what we have accomplished and move ahead. Persecuting people only sets us back. Get to know who is

really on your side. Although it’s obvious to me, you may be surprised.

Majors
losing

ohnny
Majors
had a
few sugges-
tions to wake
his football
team out of
its two—game
slumber -
by using a
“cattle prod”
and a “cane.”

“All of us should be caned,
including me,” Majors joked
at yesterday’s press confer-
ence.

Although Majors tried to
make light of the situation, it
may not be a bad idea.
Remember the last time an
American was caned? Ohio
native Michael Fay who lived
in Singapore, received four
lashes for vandalizing a car -
he sure learned his lesson.

But those were the only
quips that Majors would speak
at the conference. The usually
upbeat, positive Majors spoke
with a fiery tension in his
voice, a direct result of Pitt’s
21-9 loss to Boston College at
home last weekend.

“I’m very upset,” Majors
said stemly. “I’m mad. I’m
very upset that we are not
doing better than what we are
at the present time.”

It could be that Majors,
notoriously known for
rebuilding football programs,
is getting impatient with his
young Panther squad.

It’s stated in black and white
that Majors is a born winner.
His 177 career wins ranks him
eighth among active NCAA
coaches. He is tied for 10th
among coaches for leading his
team to bowl appearances
(16).

Additionally, Majors led a
horrific Iowa State program to
its first two bowl games in
school history. He built
Tennessee into a national
powerhouse. And most impor-
tantly, his coaching pinnacle
culminated when he took a _1—
10 Pitt team 21 years ago and
led the Panthers to a perfect
12-0 national championship
four years later.

Could the natural—bom win-
ner have met his match, or is
this just a ploy to pump up his
team?

“I thought we had some-
thing to look forward to in this
crazy business,” Majors said.

Naturally, with the rebuild-
ing state that Pitt is in with
Majors’ second stint, he
expects; improvement like he
had his first go around.

Green, BC surprise Pitt with running game

Matt,Serlin/Staff Photographer

BC's David Green had his best game of the year against Pitt.

vous. We knew we were playing
behind a new quarterback, and
we had to pick up the running
game,_ so we did our best.” .
BC, which in traditional _fash-
ion this season has averaged
passing for twice as many yards
as rushing, had to ﬁnd an alter-
native to starting’ quarterback

Mark Hartsell for Saturday’s
game when Hartsell went down
with a dislocated finger against
Virginia Tech. BC head coach
Dan Henning chose true fresh-
man Scott Mutryn, who had
only three career passing
attempts, to start the game;

The rookie’s inexperience,

which manifested itself in a very
shaky first half, made strong
Eagle running a neccessity. The
new QB meant tight end Pete
Mitchell, billed as BC’s’ top gun
and rated a preseason first-team
All-American by various
sources, was limited in the use
of his highly touted receiving
abilities.

“Our passing game wasn’t
completely stable today, but that
should be expected with a new
quarterback trying to make the
transition to college,” Mitchell
said. “Today I concentrated on
blocking, and as long as we win,
I’ll be as happyblocking as I am
catching passes. Our job today
was to establish the running
game.”

And Green took his part of the
job very seriously. He gained
more than half of BC’s total
yards on a day when both BC
and Pitt offenses were signifi-
cantly less productive than they
were averaging this year. Green,
whose only mistake was a fum-
ble, had more yards on Saturday
(186) than total before the game
(168) and was instrumental in
setting up BC’s second back,
Justice Smith, for several big
gainers.

“David had a very good day,”
Henning said. “The passing
game wasn’t gelling, especially
with the two early interceptions,
but David helped pick up the
slack.”

Green wasted no time in help-
ing get BC on the board. On the
opening drive of the game, he

“She was exceptional,” said
Steve Lewis, head coach for

the whole ran‘ very well, they

_ ran tough."

“I was happy [with my per-
formance],” Martin said. “I
felt good, and I feel I ran

“Angie ran well. She started
to ‘go out fast like she does,

Witha lead of 15 points, the
Panthers finished in frontof
Malone College, - Akron

‘Varsity which scored 64

points, and the Junior Varsity
Akron Squad which came in
last with 147 points.

“I think [the women’s team]
did good,” Martin said. “They
deserve credit.” ,

Credit was what the
women’s team got from their
coaches, but it was praise that
found its way to the men’s
team.

“I felt very.good about the

junior Dennis Kuntz that
means more results like the
ones they put up at Canton.

“It’s going to hurt us,”
Umbleby said of the loss of
Nesko. '

“We are going to have to
increase our intensity and just
run faster.” ' .

Umbleby won the men’s
"meet with a time of 25:32,

. and Kuntz was not far behind

at 26:11 to place Second.

“I think I did fairly well,
but I can do better,” Kuntz
said.

With a total of 50 points,
the Panthers were outdone

“I was happy with my performance.

But it is going to take a lot more from the

other runners to help us do well.”

Lewis said. -

For the men’s team, there
were hurdles they had to’ jump
that were not on the course.

Team leader Frank Nesko
and Matt Clarkson who
round out the top runners for
the men, are gone for the
cross country season due to
injuries.

Malone College came in third

For the Panthers it was
sweet success with the one-

Kuntz.

“Dennis is running very
well,” Schwartz said. “He’s
worked hard.”

Schwartz makes it a point
not to divulge the injuries of
his team, nor does he rely on
them in a scapegoat fashion».
He works’ with what he has,
and that is a top runner in
Umbleby. * 7

“He’s outstanding,”
Schwartz said. “Mike’S a
great kid, a good student and
a talented runner.” I

__ '“I was happy with my per- '
formance,” Umbleby said.

“But it is going to take a lot
more from the other runners
to help us do well.”

‘Those runners that
Umbleby referred to are

freshman Ryan Buckley, Ed ‘

Adamson and walk-on fresh-
man Matt Samuel.
Adamson finished with a

time of 26:54 to finish in sev-

enth place, while newcomer
Samuel was not far behind. at

For Lewis and Schwartz, it
is not only the top runners
who are crucial to the success
of the team but_alSo those

“Personally, I think they

Fortin said the forfeit

“We were looking forward

to playing them, but unfortu-

Pitt’s next match is against

Saturday, Oct. 1.

“We went like three years

[last year] we beat them-with

“I think that drive really gave

The extent of BC’s running
took some Pitt defenders by

‘surprise. ‘
“You look at BC statistically

and they are a passing team
that will only set up with one
back,” Pitt linebacker Tom
Tumulty said. “They came out
running with two backs today
and were fairly successful.”
Green said he was surprised

’ by the way Pitt’s defense set

up.

“We saw mainly eight—man.

fronts against us in the
Michigan and Virginia Tech
games,’’, he said.v“Pitt did
some of [that defense], but
they dropped a lot of guys
back, too, which I felt gave me
a good chance at picking up
yards.”

According to Tumulty, the
draw play, mainly run to
Green, played a big part in the
Eagles’ success.

“Our line was set up to.
defend the pass, but then

[Green] would run at us,”.

Tumulty said.’ “But we fixed
the problem in the second half.

Pitt’s defense did not allow a
score after the opening seconds
of the second quarter, but the
damage was done and Green
continued to pound away, pick-

ing up first downs and keeping .
the ball from a struggling Pitt '

offense. ‘

_ Green said if he had his way,
fans would have seen a third
