A visitation policy review»,
scheduled for the end of spring
term, did ‘not take place because
“there weren’t enough students
available in
review,” according to Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Conney Kimbo. ’ '

However, statistcs for the sum-.

mer session have been collected by
the Office of Residence Life, and a
review is planned after the fall term,
Kimbo said.
~ “It’s'too—early to tell how effec-
tively the policy is working,” accor-
ding to Kimbo. Statistics on the
policy are being collected on a
daily basis by the Office of
Residence. Life, Kimbo said. i
“Collecting data in itself is a
review,” he added. '
Inter Residence Board chairman
Robbie The said a formal review of
the policy was to have taken place

spring for a full-

after spring session.

The review was planned when the
revised policy was announced at a
board. of trustees meeting. last
February, according to The.

“The visitation policy is still in '

violation of four counts of the stu-_
, dent code of conduct,” The said.’

Dorm Policy:

A Review  

The IRB is planning to present
reports -of the spring and summer
terms at a board of trustees meeting
in October, The added.
~ Of the 500-600 students who lived
in the residence halls during spring
and summer sessions, 325 commit-
ted violations of the newly in-
stituted policy, according to Resi-
dent Student Association advisor

Tim Snyder. Approximately 10-15
letters-of violation were sent a day,
he added. 

Also, 36 individuals‘ were brought
before the judicial board, Snyder
said. ' " __

“Everyone brought :before the
judicial’ board was found guilty,”

according to Snyder. 9"

‘Guilty students are placed on;
probation for one term, and are

prohibited from ‘representing . the ’ '

residence hall in any manner during
the probation period.

If a sttrdent on probation com-
mits another offense, his visitation
privileges are withdrawn for two
weeks. . ‘ .

' Last year’s claims that the policy
was unenforceable have been pro-
ven false, according‘ to Snyder.

“It-(the policy) is easy to enforce.

The problem is in taking the time to

do it,” Snyder said. “But we are
taking the time.” '

A new rating system places Pitt
22nd on a list of the top so
engineering schools in the country.
The new system, devised by Dean of
Engineering Donald D. Glower of
Ohio State University, clairnsto put
the ranking process on an“
pirical” basis. ._ g E

Previous ratings were based on
the opinions of deans and faculty
members. _

“My intention was to verify or
refute the traditional survey ap-
proach,” Glowcrfsaid in an inter-
view, “and to put it on a solid basis,
rather thanhearsay or intuition.

"“The proof of the quality of a
program,” Glower added,‘ “lies in
the quality of the product, the

’ graduate. ’ ’

T Using Who’s Who in Engineering
entries as a measure of success,
Glower has assigned point values‘
for citations per thousand living
alumni per school. At the top of the.

em- _

list, Harvard scored 73.9- points,
Glower’s Ohio State engineering
school ranked seventh, with 16,7

.,,_

points, and. Pitt, ranked 22nd, ac-‘ 

cumulated 10. 1 points.

While the-old survey methods

may have successfully been debunk-._ ’

ed, questions remain as to. the

"significance._of Glower’s new

‘system.

_“I have difficulty with what is be-
ing measured,” said Dr. William
Rudoy, associate dean of academics

for the Pitt School of Engineering. .  ‘

“Can you really get .a number such.
as 10.1 that is better thanv9.9; which
makes you 22nd instead of 23rd.”

Rudoy feels that the goals and’
orientations of various programs, E‘

especially at the graduate level‘, are '

specific and virtually incomparable. P

“You have to consider what it is,

“The Facts of Life,” a 35-hour
television series dealing with human
sexuality, has won first palce in the

American Psychological Founda-
tion’s National Media Competition.
Dr. Ellen Frank, assistant professor
of psychiatry at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
(WPIC), produced and hosted the
series. It was aired on KDKA-TV
Pittsburgh.

, The American‘ Psychological
Foundation (APF) is a foundation
organized under the direction of the

‘American Psychological Associa-
tion. Its main purpose is to promote
psychology throughout the entire

.nation, according to official

statements.

‘Each year for the past 27 years,

The series took a development
approach according to Frapk. It

started from the beginning of
development of pre-schoolers to ag-
ed adults. Programs on veneral
disease and the affects of alcohol on
sexuality are also covered.

Frank said that she specifically
used the media because ‘ ‘a lot of the
discomfort and distress people ex-
perience, related to the sexual part
of their lives, comes from a simple
lack of good information. It is very

difficult to get good accurate infor-

mation about sexuality. This series
was simply an attempt to provide.
that kind of information.”

“It is very diﬂicult .

.. The U.S. Senate is currently considering legislation
that would increase the availability of federal educa-

.. tional funding to financially strapped college

- students. ' ‘

i  H.R. "5192, a bill introduced to the House last
‘ ‘ November is aimed at:

—Increasing the maximum annual allotment of

 Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG) over
._ a‘ fiveyear period from $1,800 to 2,600‘by ﬁscalyear ~-
. 1985. - '

’ —Increasing the maximum amount of the Sup-

from the current $1,500 to $2,000 over five years.

-I legislation by way of increases in the availability of ‘

—Increasing the State Student Incentive Program
from $1,500 to $2,000 also over five years.

' —Increasing the amount of ‘money available for

loans to undergraduate and graduate students.

'  ~ _ A ' ‘ Dependent undergraduates will be permitted to bor-
 _ " " a e I l  - row up to $12,500 over four years of study instead of

the current rate of $7,500 over four years. Graduate ‘

students will have their allotment increased from
$15,000 to $25,000. _ .

If passed the bill will not come without certain
strings attached. Passage would cause interest rates
on federal loans to rise from eight to nine percent as
well as shortening the time students have to begin
repaying loans from nine months to six months
within graduation. .. . »

Parents would stand to gain. by passage of the

loans issued through the Parent Loan Program.

Although students will be forced to pay for plen- ,

tiful dollars by way of “higher interest "rates, this: help
for the beleagered student could not have come a
minute sooner—especially for students at Penn-
sylvania’s state-related universities, who eachyear

for the past five years have faced skyrocketing tui-
tion. I ’ ‘
Students here at Pitt pay tuition that is twice as

. high as that‘ paid by students at comparable state

universities across the nation. And, with another tui-
tion increase in the offing next term, some relief must
soon be sent the Pitt students way. 7
. But, H.R. 5192 has encountered some roadblocks
on both the Senate and=House sides of Capitol Hill.
“When originally introduced last November it pass-
ed the House which waved it on for Senate approval.
After the customary Senate markup session which
resulted in a suitable altered version of the original
House bill, the conference committee failed to come
up with a report that would pass both chambers.
Now with a version of the bill pending that both
sides. believeiwill be passable the issue comes up for
jointconsideration once again this week.
‘Although students should have been aware and
taking action long ago concerning this legislation, it"

is never to -late too. let their voice be heard on Capitol '

Hill. For now, they can hope, combining with that
hope a quick letter or phone call to_ their senator and

_ congressman. It only takes a minute to save a bundle.

‘No’t since the Civil War has there
been an actual or a threat of seces-
sioniof a state or states from the

~ United States. The thought of the ,_

occurrence probably doesn’t even
carry enough seriousness to raise an
eyebrow of the average layman.

'_Perhaps the little weight that such a
threat carries is why the possible

secession of Alaska from the Union
brought. so little media attention
when the issue broke earlier this
month.

When.the province of Quebec
threatened to secede from Canada,

a ‘lengthy battle ensued between the
‘ . proponents and opponents of the

proposal. The controversy received
massive media coverage not only in

Canada but in the United States, as
V well.

This new threat that comes
from our 49th state appears to have
been taken lighly by the media and
the politicians, and it should be
paid more attention.

‘In‘late August, Alaskan voters
narrowly approved a precedent-

 setting commission to re-examine
  their 21-year-old statehood pact

with the United States. The crea-
tion of the Alaska Statehood Com-

 " mission is the first such panel in any
~ state and "could be the first -step

toward secession.

A United Press International
analysis of the situation deems the
matter has little political implica-

iﬂtions because it passed by such _a V
I ‘ nall rnargin. The commission was

approved by a vote of 46,287 to

45,319 and will consist of eleven
‘members who will
plementations of the Alaska
Statehood Act of 1959, problems of
other western states, and alternative
federal-state relationships. Six
members of the commission will be
picked by the state legislature and
five by Gov, Jay Hmmond. '

More than likely the approval of
the commission comes’ as a result of
the growing resentment of Alaskans

claims of Alaska's 55,000 Eskimos,
Indians, and Aleuts, pay 40 million
acres of land, and approximately
$925 million in compensation.

The second major issue revolved
around‘ the proposed construction
of the controversial 800-mile,
48-inch trans-Alaska Pipeline from
Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean
to the Gulf of Alaska port of
a project’ which ‘ took
several years to complete and ended

with the federal government’s intru-
sion into the state’s concerns. The
most recent bickering in Congress
has centered around the fate of the
vast forest lands in the state.
Alaska's land, first among the
states in area, is 97 percent owned
by the federal government.

Two other issues--touted’ by
Alaskans to equal its~ battle for
statehood--occurred in the l970’s.
In one of its last acts of . 1971, Con‘-
gress passed the .._Alaska Native

up costing more than $4 billion
dollars--three times the original

"estimated cost!

The state, along with the Loui-
siana Purchase, was one of the best
real estate deals ever made by the
government. Alaska, which is 500,
miles from the nearest state,

Washington, was purchased from _

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Ass‘! Sports Editor
“We’re not a good_ foot-ball
” said Temple coach Wayne ;

yesterday’s ,Press Football Lun-
cheon._ “I’m very disappointed.”
And well he should be. After
coming off the 1979 season with a
.10-2 record, inclucing a win in the
Garden State Bowl against Califor-
nia, the Owls opened withtwo con-

; 1 secutive defeats. Delaware beat-

Teinple 28-7 and Rutgerswon 21-3.

“As a team, we’re just not
there,” Hardin said. “But we have
individuals who . could be
stars.” . _ - ' 5‘

Those individuals include junior
quarterback Tink Murphy. He is

H" -A . most dangerous when rushed out of
- I thepocket to throw. His favorite

reciever is junior Gerald Lucear,

who is one of the main keys to the

Owl offensive attack. 5
Defensively, the standouts are

A safety Mark McCants and defensive
ends Colin McCarty and Guy
Peters. All three are known for '

their hard hitting and strong, ag-
gressive play.

Those individuals,‘ however, will

not be nearly enough to bring the .

Owls an upset victory.
“Pitt is the finest defensive team

'I’ve seen of the field,” said the

Temple coach, “They play with
re_ckless abandon._ Their only

 ’ weakness seems to-be the punting
_ game but if they don’t have to punt,

it’s not a problem,” .

“I expect Pitt to have a fine day ,-
and our kids will do the best they” ’
1 can,

he continued. “Whatever

happens, happens.’ ’

L Whatever happens will probably
be caused by the Pitt defense. The

members of that unit have but one

[goal to strive for: to shut down the

opposition totally. Against Kansas
last week, the Panthers held the

Jayhawks to; four net yards rushing.

“We’l1 probably never get‘ a

‘ group of guys like this together

said defensive coach
Fazio. "‘Our guys are

again,”
uFOgen

‘crazy. They love to practice. They

area very intelligent group of guys _
and they know how to play
together.

“The first thing is to win,” he
continued, “then to shut everybody
down. That is the goal to achieve’

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News §Vporls Writer \

Looking over the lineup and the
expectations for tonight’s soccer
game with Carnegie-Mellon could
be "compared to gazing at an
awesome injury report. There are

.far more Panther booters running

around (or trying to run around)
practice taped up than there are
not. They can be seen in many sizes
and shapes from fullback Jim
,Hackworth’s style that covers a cut

_ below his right knee to that of the

full leg (wrapped from the thigh to

 ankle) of sweeperback Don Bowen.
\_ Injuries have certainly begun\to
take their toll on the Pitt soccer _
f squad and Coach Leo, Bemis ‘has
3 been forced to search throughout a‘;
‘very,-young‘ ‘crop-.of players _j'_to_‘ fill”

the Pitt defense, Fazio suggested
that an option play would be effec-
tive to help open boththe running
and passing games. The effect
would be to have the defense scat-
tered and not knowing what to ex-
pect. ’

Although Pitt hasn’t played a

real powerhouse offense such as,

Alabama and Oklahoma, coach
Fazio expects that the Panther
defense could play with anybody in
the nation.‘

“If they (opponent) get the ball
first-and-goal at the five, hey, that’s
why we’re called a defense and we
have to stop them,” the Panther
coach said. Z_ 1

Pitt junior linebacker Sal Sunseri
was present to add his thoughts.

“Our trueiasset is how close we
are,” he ‘said. ‘‘I know where
(Steve) Fedell is going to be, I know
where (Hugh) Green is going to be,
and Green's all over so it’s pretty
easy to find him.‘ I feel like I
adopted ten guys.” -

Sunseri gives much of the credit;

for the success defensively to the
coaches. .

“The defensive coaches, all of
them, havevdone an outstanding job
of scouting. They put us in the right
place at the right time,” he said.

Panther tight end Mike Dom-

A ‘broski cohinaentted‘ onthe Panther

  

offense.

“We have a great quarterback
and great recievers,” said the senior
tight end. ‘The offensive line is
coming around and our confidence
is building. up.

“Even though Temple is not that.
good,” he continued, “we’ll play
them like Notre Dame or
something.”

Panther ‘coach _ Jackie Sherrill

. spoke about the performance of ‘the

defense. “The defense has cashed
a lot of checks,” he said,‘ referring
to the way Pitt hits people on
defense. ‘ - \

“We have some exceﬂlent players
on our defense, but they were made
into great players,” said the Pitt

., coach. “Paterno said that he never

even offered three of our down
linemen scholarships.” ‘
When asked about the perfor-
mance of the team during the Kan-
\sa‘s game, he'c6nceded that the Pan-
thers probably should of scored

the spots left vacant. One of the
biggest changes to occur tonight
when the Panthers take the field at
7:15 p.m. will be concerning the
halfback lineup. Junior standout
Al Adlemann may not see action
tonight because of a bruised tendon
in his knee received in last.
weekend’s 2-1 _loss to -Slippery
Rock. Adelmann was kicked behind
the knee midway through the first
half of play against the Rockets and
saw limited playing time in the re-
mainder of the contest. The loss of
-Adelmann for any length of time
would be quite disappointing

because ofvthe skill and knowledge ~

that the outside halfback possesses.

The big‘ switch by_,l_3_emis will be to

more. ‘ -

“We averaged 400 total yards of
_offense.and that’s pretty good,” he
said. “A lot of teams would like to
do that.” ‘

“Kansas is. going to win some
games this }year. They are better
than people think,” said Sherrill.
“Boston, College has no respect
around thecountry and they beat
Stanford pretty well.”

i Sherrill’s ifcomments about Kan-
sas gain -merit; when one realizes
that Kansas played Oregon to 7-7 in
their opener, and Oregon comes

‘hopes that Kunkel can use his‘ scor-

ing ability‘ to put a few in the nets
from the midfield spot.
“Kunkel has the fire-power that

we need to score some more goals,” .
said Bemis. “He has a good, hard

shot and is capable of playing in the
midfield. With Al slowed down,
that is exactly what we need. Our
midfielders need to shoot more, as
do those on the front line, and the
addition of Kunkel will hopefully
assist us.”

The decision following - the
Kunkel move is who to put in the
vacant fullback position. With Don
Bowen still questionable at sweeper
back the addition of a replacement

for Kunkel would be the-second
newcomer to thedefense. Filling in ‘

“He (Marino) won't care, as long

Heinmbach. Kunkel’s spot will pro-
bably’ be filled by Ron Heinley.
Another possibility could be
sophomore Mike Hrynko. Either
way, the possible loss of Bowen and
Kunkel could endanger a very solid
Panther defense.

Looking at the front line, the
Panthers will be without the ser-
vices of starting wing John Pizzella
who is out with a pulled tendon in
his ankle. Filling in for Pizzella in
Pitt’s last contest was sophomore
.Troy Norton. The decision proved
to be a good on_e as Norton scored
the Panther’s ‘only goal with 12

“My roster now shows 17 and the
‘bulk of my team is sophomores.”
Ludwig, in her first year as coach
for Pitt field hockey is a graduate
student studying for her_masters in
physiology, with three
years previous coaching experience
at Winchester Thurstan. She
played for Ashland College in Ohio

as an undergraduate; and is now a

member of The Pitt Club.
Since the turn-over in coaching
last January, the Pantherettes have
' dropped from a first division to se-
cond ‘division team, said Ludwig.
The drop in division is due to a drop

in recruiting and available scholar;

ships,‘explained Ludwig.
“Field hockey is extremely
political,” said Ludwig. “Our top

    

_opponent this . year, Davis and
Elkins, is a division one team.
They’ve put a lot of money towards
recruiting avidly and giving scholar-
ships,” said Ludwig.

In the past few years, said Lud-
wig, field hockey has been under
some changes in systems of play.

“Hockey has always been a com-
plex sport,” insisted Ludwig.

“The new systems of play have
opened it ‘up and made it move.
There is a lot more fluidity to the
game now.” I .

Coach Ludwig said the idea is to
have more players attacking on
goal. Play should be broken up ear-
'ly on,” said‘ Ludwig. “Therefore
my players must be in top physical

condition in order to sprint.

win, polishing off the next four
games to defeat Mary Beth Pas-

6-3,7-5. » ’

The teams were evenly matched,
as the singles competition ended in
a 3-3 deadlock. Senior Randi
Belkin easily handled Pasqualic-
chio, 6-0, 6-4. Cathy Jacobson,
hampered by a chest cold, won her

‘first set, 7-6 viaia 9 point tie-

breaker. However, she could not

~Lisa LaFuria earned the next

defeat Vivian Pansino, 5-7, 6-2,

therette’s number-four player, 'was
a victim of Cyndy Elek, 5-7, 2-6.

Freshman Jody Mattioli also_found
the going rough, as she suffered a
heart-breaking loss, 5-7, 5-7, to
Janet Getzy. To round out the
singles, frosh Jan Kastory turned

tallying a 5-7, 6-2, 6-0 win for the
Pantherettes. I

“Lisa LaFuria played «an ag-
gressive game, something 'we’ve.
been working on for awhile,” said
Coach Fran Webster. “It really
worked to her advantage.”

However, Jan Kastory was the
most improved player, according to
Webster.\‘ ‘

“She was down 5-7, and came
back to soundly defeat her oppo-

nent,” she said. “I like to see that ‘

kind of aggressiveness and_poise in

The doubles competition was just
as evenly ‘matched. LaFuria and

Weinberg-easily defeated Pansino »

that highlighted LaFuria’s net play.

Mattioli and Kastory put up a fight’ 4

before conceding to Getzy and

Qout those areas that we want to
serve.”

In terms of product or “the
graduate,” Rudoy said that the ob-
jectives of an individual are basic
factors in both his choice of a pro-
gram and what he does afterward.

“What if a student is interestedin
heat transfer, for example?” he
said. “He’s not looking at I the
overall school, or even the graduate
program, but a specific element in

igiat program.”

Another questionable facet of the
method is its “measure of success”
in the Who’s Who in
Engineering, according to Rudoy.

“If you look at the power struc- I

‘ture,” Glower said, “and you see

1

that a person?s made president of a
corporation, well, somewhere along
the line they had to be a pretty good
engineer.” . .

Rudoy disagrees.

“If the only successes are Who’s
Who, or presidents of corporations,
then yes, certain programs are not.

receive a schedule in

visor’s session will be.

Rudoy said, “but you have to ask
whether that particular engineer
achieves that position because of his
technical expertise, or his manage-
ment and administrative expertise.”
“Also,” Rudoy added, “after he
graduates he may be put incharge
of some project, doing good
technical engineering, but he’s not
president of the, company. ’ ’

’_ Another question many observers '

ask is:‘ Just who looks atthese
surveys? Both Rudoy and Glower

say that they, themselves, do not\

pay much attention tothe rankings.
Neither do they effect funding nor,
it seems, do students pay much at-
tention to them.

An informal. survey of
undergraduate engineering students.
at Pitt taken by The‘. Pitt ‘News:
reveals no one who claimed to con-.
sider rank in their choice of schools.

However, factors, such as location. 9‘

and price were predominant.

“I think rankings are used when

there" is a lack of » information)“

Rudoy said, “but they mostly tend
to reinforce a student's choice

already made on the-basis of other _

considerations.”

“I’ve had a lot of my buddies call

the response has been favorable,”
Glower said.

“Where l’ve gotten negative mail
is from the schools that are not /in-.
cluded in the top 20, and they’re

mad because they weren't
included,” the added.

Asked about Pitt’s number 22
