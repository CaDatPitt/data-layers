WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1974 A 

, Steep Bread Price Hike

BY RITA VITOLO
Local bakers warned Tuesday the
price of bread may soar to 75 cents

.  or’ more a loaf unless the United

        

States curbs wheat exportation.

“We’re asking the government
to hold back on shipments of wheat
overseas until there is enough for
our domestic needs,” said United
Baking President George Gordon.

“If they would guarantee enough
wheat for this country then the
price of wheat will come down, the
speculators would sell what they're
holding and things would settle
down. A big thing that’s driving
the price up is speculators.”

Meanwhile, the American Bak-
ers Association began a “Save our
Bread” campaign in Washington
yesterday to drum upicongressional
support for a brake on US wheat
exports until next summer’s
harvest.

Local bakers reported difficulties
in obtaining ﬂour and a tight
market forcing prices higher,
although an actual shortage does
not yet exist.

“Up to now there hasn't been a
shortage, but the way things are
goin’, there’s soon gonna be,” said
Stagno’s Bakery chairman Frank
Stagno. “What I want the
government to do is to stop sending
flour over to Europe and sell it to

91

US.

25¢ fee cancelled

Flour has increased from $7.25 to
$15.30 per 100 lbs. in one year
Stagno claimed.

Gordon predicted bread prices
“will level off by July or August,
provided it's a good crop,”
although prices may “go as high as
31 soon if there’s a shortage.”

The bakers said no end to the
price increase was in sight. Said
United’s Gordon: “If there is no
flour, what would you bid for a loaf
of bread?”

The /Agriculture Department
however, called talk of $1 bread
ridiculous and unsubstantiated.
The wheatvsupply will be tight but
there will be .-no shortages, -they
claimed.

Price increases for Squirrel Hill’s
Bagel Land may be passed onto
students via the Tuck Shop, “if the
price goes up anymore,” according
to Szabo’s vending manager.
Bagel Land reported an increase in
flour prices to $15.75 per 100 lbs.. ,
up from $8.50 a year ago.

USDA officials estimate soaring
exports will leave a reserve of'178
million bushels of wheat at the end
of the current fiscal year, the
smallest in 27 years.

Heinz Announces Canclidacyi

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Congressman H. John Heinz III

announced his candidacy for‘

re-election yesterday, calling for a
redirection of national priorities
and for more attention to domestic
matters from the executive branch.
“The issues are beyond partisan
politics.

“When law-abiding Americans
become revoloutionaries, when
wages are frozen and the sky’s the
limit for profits, I think something
is wrong,” Heinz said.

Republican Heinz, representa-
tive for Pennsylvania’s 18th
district, was elected in 1971 to ﬁll
the vacancy created by the death of
Robert J. Corbett, then was
re-elected in 1972 by a 73%
margin, the biggest for any
Republican candidate that year.

When‘ asked if Watergate 'would
affect his re-election campaign
Heinz remarked the credibility of
government as a whole had
suffered because of Watergate.

-“Everyone who holds office
today has been hurt by it,” he said.
“The credibility of the President,

the attention-to domestic affairs is

all hurting, and it’s hurting
Republicans more than Demo-
crats.”_

Heinz described the recent
statement by President Nixon that
Congress would not impeach him,
as wishful thinking. If the evidence
was presented, Heinz said, Con-
gress would react with impeach-
ment.

“The President is a man, he is
not above the law. There is no

New Time Schedule Policy Announced

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
A free distribution system for fall
1974 time schedules was an-

nounced yesterday by Vice-
chancellor of Business and Finance
Joseph A. Dutton. The system
replaces the proposed plan of
charging students 25 cents for
schedules. -

The announcement followed 21
days of controversy during which
Student Government, other student
leaders, and Board of Trustees
members rejected the original plan
and negotiated with administators
for a viable alternative.

Time schedules will now be free
to all students registering for the
fall term.

During the add-drop period next
fall, however, additional time
schedules will cost 10-cents. In
making the announcement, Dutton
urged students to retain their time

' Ische,dulés- ‘shou'ld”1t'hey need them”

.for other purposes in the future.
; The switch from the original.25
cent fee proposal to the free
distribution plan was “dominant-
ly” made, Dutton said, because of
the low costs offered by the
University by a printing company
to produce the fall schedules.

“It was also due to some of the

student input,” Dutton added.

“The logic became so over-
whelming as opposed to my
original Sears and Roebuck ap-
proach." '
Dutton said- an attempt was
made three years ago to have time
schedules printed in the newsprint
fashion, but no printers available
had the necessary equipment.

“Time schedules are consider-
ably less expensive than pre-
viously,” Dutton said.

Student .Government President.

Mike Furick, who led the opposi-

W tion to the original'25.cent‘ fee " was W

pleased with the administration's
new policy.

“The administration was very
receptive to our ideas," Furick
said. “Posvar took both proposals
(alternatives offered by Dutton and
Furick in negotiations), looked at
them, and then told Joe (Dutton)
what he should do.

‘‘I think the administration was
concerned--they responded,”
Furick added. ,‘‘It is kind of an
open door policy the student
representatives have here with the
administration.”

Furick thought the ordeal was a
good showing for the newly elected
Student Government Board, many
of whom had no prior experience in

working with administrators.

“From the beginning I knew it
was not a fair policy," Furick said
of the orginal 25 cent fee proposal.
“I knew it was only a matter of time
before the administration saw that
it wasindeed an unfair_:plan;’_’

legitimate claim to executive
privilege,” said Heinz.

“An impeachable offense is what
the House says it is, not necessarily
a crime.” Heinz felt there should
be cooperation with the investiga-
tion into the facts surrounding
Watergate, and any attempt to hold
back on President Nixon’s part
would be easily taken by some as
an indication of guilt.

Rep. H. John Heinz III

“I take the view that impeach-
ment is the ultimate, necessary
remedy for a president who abused
his powers,” said Heinz.

Talking about the oil crisis and
the energy crunch, Heinz outlined
his "considerations for Congress-

ional action to relieve the causes of 5

the oil crisis andresulting energy
crunch.

“The first fact is that half of the
petroleum produced in this country
is not under price control of any
kind and is sold at the most

exorbitant prices the market will ..
. bear.”

According to Heinz, his plan to
roll back the price of oil, which is
opposed by President Nixon, would
lower the cost to $7-$8 per barrel.

Heinz said contacts_ with oil ' "
industry people indicated this price ,

would still offer the necessary
incentive for increased develop-
ment of sources.

It was essential, Heinz declared,
to have an excess profits" tax,
control and roll back of the price of
petroleum products and a forced
devestiture by oil companies of
their retail outlet holdings.

The rumors in .the baking
industry that bread would soon cost

about $1 a‘loaf caused Heinz to _

comment_ American wheat inven-

tories were inadequately protected _ V

by export-quotas.

“We are the only country that ‘ I ,

doesn’t control the exports of
commodities critical to the popula-

tion,” Heinz said, “I feel,,quite, .
frankly, that the Administration A; j
made promises to Russia, made a

deal for Russia to let us out of the
Vietnam War with what some

people have described as peace 5

with honor.

“Individually I am demanding,”-. '1

Heinz said, “that Secretary‘ of

Agriculture Butz make a finding as _

to what the critical level of wheat
inventories is, the issue of at what
point are inventories of wheat too
low to permit the marketing" of
bread? Until the Secretary takes a

stand we have nothing to argue. 1,

about.”

Heinz had a meeting yesterday “ii
with representatives of the Bakers’, "

Association in Washington DC.

Along with his considerations in 
Heinz  

the coming campaign,
accented the ability of politicians to

deal with the problems of the, I 
moment, and not necessarily the‘ 
way they have dealt with problems '

in the past. ‘

energy are scarce

HARRISBURG AP -- The House
State Government Committee
approved legislation Tuesday
which would grant the Governor
broad powers to deal with the
energy crisis.

The 10-3 vote sent the legislation
to the House floor.

Before the panel voted ﬁnal
approval, the Republican con-
trolled committee rejected along
party lines a administration plan to
vest powers in a 15-member energy
council. The committee than’
decided to empower Gov. Shapp to
appoint a state energy czar.

The legislation, which has
bi-partisan sponsorship, would
enable Shapp to impose a manda-
tory gasoline rationing system.
The current alternate-day system is
voluntary.

The bill allows the governor to

‘ appoint the energy chief after

determining an energy crisis
exists.

The official would have power to:
--Order any person, political
subdivision or agency of the
Commonwealth to reduce their use
of fuel or specify amounts that may
be used.

---Establish priorities for distribu-
’ tion of _fuel.

‘--Regulate the use of motor vehicle
fuels by fixing the days and hours
of distribution and the maximum
and minimum quantities.

--Require regular reporting by oil

companies on the amount and
location of motor vehicle fuel in
Pennsylvania.

The energy official would not
have powers over natural gas
companies and electric utilities,
because they’re regulated by the
Public Utility Commission.

Ronald G. Lench, Gov. Shapp’s
legislative secretary, said the
administration would take no
immediate position on the bill--
despite rejection of the council
concept. Lench appeared before
the committee to offer the council
plan.

“It seems we might be able to do
better with a council than. with
vesting power in one individual
because a council would provide
added expertise,” he told a
newsman after the meeting.

However,‘ the Republican mem-
bers disagreed on this point, with

Rep. David Turner, R-Bradford, ~
‘ commenting:

“We need to ap-
point a czar to call the shots and get
this moving.”

Rep. Earl Vann, D-Philadelphia,
taking the opposite view, said,
“This puts too much authority in
one person’s hands.”

Gov. Shapp has appointed by
executive order a 14-member
energy council headed by Lt. Gov.
Ernest P. Kline. While that council
could continue to function if the
new legislation became law, it only
could recommgig final action to the

C3ov. May Name Energy Czar

energy chief. J
The legislation still can be
amended on the House floor.

Probes Mushroom ,5,

Canning Process

HARRISBURG AP - A special
$25,‘O00 research grant has been
awarded to the National Canners
Association for a crash study of the
causes of spoilage in mushrooms,
the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.

Secretary Jim McHale said the
emergency grant is an attempt to
aid the mushroom industry which
he said is ailing because of recalls
of canned mushrooms containing
botulinum toxin.

The nationwide publicity has
caused a substantial loss in sales
and decline in proﬁts for domestic

mushroom processors, McHale-

said. Pennsylvania grows more
than 60 per cent of the nation’s
mushrooms.

The grant, which runs from Feb.
1 to June 30, is from a $400,000
fund from harness racing proceeds
for agricultural research, McHale
said. A

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement over the old fash-
ioned boxsprinig mattress. Doctors have recognized the therapeutic and hy-
gienic values of the waterbed for many years. When sleeping on a wuterbed
your back, shoulders and hips receiveytotal floatation support. ‘Body weight is
distributed more evenly than is possible on any conventional bed, malcingra

waterbed the most comfortable and

 » ‘ healthful sleeping surface available.

A waterbed’s gentle heat helps relax
tense muscles while the firm floating
support Iulls you into a deep, restful
sleep.

YVONNE NICHIE

“I desperately need a ride--I
cannot afford bus fare, (no job),
and will have to give up school if I
can’t ﬁnd a ridell Please, help
me!”--a note attached to student
car pool registration form.

This student is not alone. There
are others like him, and still others
with different problems peculiar to
commuting. Together, these
students comprise close to 65% of
the student body, a percentage
long responsible for Pitt’s nick-
name--“streetcar College.”

What are these problems? What
efforts have been made to alleviate
them? How successful have these
efforts been?

PROBLEMS OF COMMUTING
BY BUS,

The vast number of commuters
either take a bus or drive to school.
Both modes present problems.

Examining the former, the bus
commuter’s primary concern is
service. The majority think the

- service to their area is inadequate,

like Chuck Woratschek, a sopho-
more from Carrick.

“I’d like to see more 54C buses
to Carrick. They run infrequently,
but a lot of commuters ride them
and often wait as long as an hour
for them.”

In an effort to improve transpor-
tation to the city, universities, and
colleges, Port Authority Transit
(PAT) established the “U-bus
service,” direct transit, in Sep-
tember.

Originally the U-bus was started
for Pitt, Camegie-Mellon, Carlow,
Chatham, and Duquesne, but
service has been extended to the
Allegheny Community College
campuses.

PAT Public Relations Director,
Edward Beechler, said, “The
U-bus has been very successful,
and is ﬁlling /a deﬁnite need in the
community. It has speeded up
transportation time for students
from areas such as North Hills and
Penn Hills, where there is no direct
transit line.”

Nancy Sears,a senior from South
Side, said, “My basic problem as a
commuter is standing on a cold bus
corner at 8 pm when the wind chill
factor is zero and the bus shelters
are on the wrong side of Fifth
Avenue. I would like to see useable
bus shelters.

“Also, a widening of Forbes
Avenue, where traffic is always

' congested, would be a help to the

commuter who spends a lot of time
traveling,” Sears added.

"A commission to study traffic
problems from the Brady Street
should be
established. It should be composed
of community people, business-
men, and planning supervisors, but
no politicians.”

FARE RATES

Next to service, the bus
commuter’s biggest problem is fare
rates. Junior Pat Hyde summar-
ized student feelings. “College
students should have fare cuts.
Grade and high school students do,
but college students have more
expenses than high school stu-
dents. That's why they commute in
the ﬁrst place.” i I
_ ___He said the areas now served by

Wednesday,

the U-buses are the geographic
areas with the greatest need.

Expanded service depends on the
continued success of the present.

Currently there are five U-buses:

ll Oakland-McKnight, 18 Oak-
land-Ohio Valley, 44 Oakland-Mt.
Lebanon, 77 Oakland Penn Hills,
and 56 Oakland-Greenfield.

Many students would like to see
a U-bus to their areas:

Sophomore Sheree Durst said,
“When I leave Pitt before 2 pm, it
takes me twice as long to get home,
because the streetcar I take is
re-routed. I'd like to see a U-bus
from Oakland to the Bethel
Park-Castle Shannon area. ’

Lawrene Brown, a senior from
Bethel Park, said, “My biggest
problem is riding buses
streetcars. PAT can’t get together
with the Bethel Boro Council about
the streetcars. They want to rip out
the lines before finding an
alternative solution.

“This would strand a lot of
college students who depend on
streetcars to get to downtown
Pittsburgh so they can get a bus ‘to
Oakland,” Brown continued.

“There should be a U-bus to the
Bethel Park area.”

In the fall of 1972, the Commuter
Association (CA), Pitt’s commuter
attempted to get

BUS STRIKES

Bus driver strikes too, though
usually only a danger during
periodic contract negotiations, pose
an additional threat to the
commuting student.

Many commuters were stranded
during the PAT employee strike
last December, and wondered how
this would effect them academ-
ically.

Provost Rhoten A. Smith issued
a statement the morning after the
strike began, urging students to
“make all reasonable efforts to
attend classes, but if transportation
problems prevent attendance, in-
structors should be informed."

The statement continued:
“Faculty members who have
commuters in their classes may
wish to make reasonable schedule
changes responsive to student
needs created by this situation.

“Certainly no student should be
penalized or prevented from
making up work which was
interrupted by this serious trans-
portation problem.”

Former CA President Margie
Masilunas was pleased with the
Provost’s action, but added, “It
should have been taken sooner.
There should be a definite
University policy concerning such
matters. I hope the strike inspires

students—-along the same lines as
those given to senior citizens,
grade, and high school students.
The commuters claim PAT was
unsympathetic to their requests.

The CA proceeded to seek the
aid of state senators and congress-
men. It ‘was reported that while
most of the replies were sympa-
thetic in tone very few expressed
an active interest in such an
undertaking.

In negotiations with PAT, the CA
discovered the company felt
students would transfer their
passes to family and friends.

In response, CA suggested, at
least in Pitt's case, students could
use their pictured ID’s with their
passes to prevent such misuse, but
no action was taken on this
proposal.

It took eight months from the
initial inquiry to really discover
why PAT refused to grant college
students reduced rates.

At a CA meeting with PAT and
City officials last April, it was noted
senior citizens, grade, and high
school students’ rates were made
possible only because of state
subsidies.

One PAT ofﬁcial remarked:
“You get the state to give us
subsidies and we’ll be glad to give
reduced rates to college students."

the University to make such a
policy.”

To date, the University has not.
CA would also like to see a policy
concerning adverse weather and
trafﬁc conditions.

COMMUTING--BY CAR

Commuiers

  

 

 

The commuter who drives to
school is busy tackling problems of
his own. His primary concern is
ﬁnding a parking space. On any
given day, the scene is like
piranhas. competing 'for a piece
of meat. '

Jerry Jeannett, a junior from
Penn Hills, said, “The parking
problems in Oakland are really
bad, because students, faculty, and
people who work in the area
compete for the same spaces on a
first come, first serve basis. I
would like to see more student lots
reserved for student parking.”

There is only one student
lot--Trees Hall Parking on Alle-
quippa Street. A 10 cent city tax
raised the rate from 50 cents to 60
cents a day. Many students to not
use the lot because they feel it is
inconveniently located and inade-
quately serviced by the campus
bus.

The CA, a pioneer pusher for the
lot, today questions its real
purpose. Was it built primarily for
student use--or athletic events?

Athletic parking has always been
$1, but last-“year, upon presentation
of an ID card, a student paid only
50 cents. This year students pay $1
along with other patrons. The
Parking Office would give no
reason forjthe change. _

Students not parking in the Trees
Hall lot have little recourse but to
park at meters. Though Pitt day
students encounter a number of
problems with meter parking, the
majority of complaints--over
500--were made to the University
by General Studies students. Their
complaints sparked an investi-
gation of meter regulation.

The General ‘Studies Council
[GS] held a parking meter

symposium last June 6 with city
officials.

The meters chosen for study
included those located in the entire
area within two blocks of the
Cathedral, with the exception of
the Schenley Plaza, and those
within the bordering streets of
Forbes and Fifth Avenues, Bigelow
and
North Dithridge.

Jack Greenberg, head of the GS
Parking Task Committee, cited as a
major problem the fact that the vast
majority of meters within this
Cathedral area are two hour
meters, and GS classes are two -and
a half hours long. Other difﬁculties
such as faculty meters, and

.illegibly marked parking times

were also mentioned.

The Committee wanted the
meters within the-designated area
extended to a four hour limit. City
Treasurer Joseph Cosetti res-
ponded “The city doesn’t move
fast to serve special interests.” He
added meters are not primarily for
revenue, but to control parking.

“We’ve considered the matter
and nothing will make us change
our minds,” he said.

Cosetti agreed there is a parking
problem in the Oakland area, but
added the “University is respon-
sible...and hasn’t moved to correct
its own problems.”

When allegations were made
against the city meter maids,
Cosetti said he doesn’t believe they
are “ticket happy creatures"
waiting» for meters to expire and
holding students back with one arm
to prevent them from depositing
money. .

I “There are 6,000 city meters.

New No-fault Bill Needs
Changes, Denenberg Says

HARRISBURG AP - A new
no-fault car insurance bill soon to
be introduced contains many good
features but needs several changes
before it is acceptable to the Shapp
administration, Insurance Com-
missioner Herbert Denenberg
says.

The measure, which has bi-
partisan sponsorship, would pro-
vide an accident victim up to
$50,000 in medical benefits regard-
less of who was at fault in the
accident. I ’

A victim could not sue, however,
for pain and suffering losses if
medical expenses were less than
$500.

Denenberg called the $500 level
too small, “especially in view of the
uncontrolled inﬂation we now

face.” He said a $1,000 threshold
would strengthen the bill.

He also said that if any portion of
the bill is struck down as
unconstitutional the entire bill
should be thrown out. The
measure does not provide that
clause now.

“In accord with the Shapp
administration’s previous stand on
no-fault the bill would be unaccept-
able without these two key
changes, but we feel that this is an
excellent beginning point and the
few necessary changes could be
made with a minimum of com-
promise,” he said Tuesday.

The bill, sponsored by ‘Rep.
Eugene Geesey, R-York, is ex-
pected to be introduced next week.

It Could Be A Litesaver

BY LEEMARKOVITZ
Bob Fryer, Pitt undergrad and

part-time worker in a funeral home,

has come up with an idea which he

thinks will save some lives.

Working with an ambulance
service, which he and some friends
started a year ago, Fryer found it
difficult to administer cardiopul-
monary resuscitation (heart
massage) while standing in an
ambulance speeding around curves

 ' _ and over potholes.

“The most important thing with
resuscitation,”
Fryer explained, “is consistency.

V‘ The paramedic must give one

cardiac compression each second
by pressing‘ his hand on the
patient’s sternum.» The procedure
is tiring as it is, but in a moving
ambulance it is even worse because
the paramedic has to fight to keep

' E . his balance.”

Fryer’s idea involves removing
the cot from the ambulance wall,

attaching it to the ﬂoor instead, and

then adding a removable seat upon 

which the paramedic could sit,
straddling the patient.

“lt’s such a simple idea, I don't
know why nobody has thought of it
before,” Fryer said. The seat itself
resembles an upside-down ‘U’ and
rests upon the side rails of the cot.

Fryer designed the seat himself,
using engineering principles he
learned as a member of Pitt’s
Road Racing Team. In fact, the
Road Racing Team helped Fryer
begin his non-profit ‘ambulance
service last year, by redesigning
four vans into ambulances. The
ambulances now serve people in
Bridgeville, South Hills, and Mt.
Lebanon.

As yet, no one in the medical
ﬁeld has had a chance to study
Fryer’s plan but he has submitted
the idea to Dr. Peter Safar, of
Presbytarian University Hospital,
who invented the cardiopulmonary
resuscitation procedure.

 

; resuscitation

Fryer described the procedure as
“The paramedic’s number one life
saving measure. Cardiopulmonary
is a method of
keeping someone alive when the
person is too weak to keep himself
alive,” he explained. “The
procedure involves one cardiac
compression per second 15 times,
alternated with mouth to mouth
resuscitation.

“When the victim is lying on the
floor and you are kneeling, the
procedure is easy to do, but when
the patient is on a cot 20 inches
high and in a moving ambulance
it’s next to impossible. I’ve done it
several times and it was ineffec-
tive.”

“I recall one particular case,’
Fryer continued, “where a fellow
had a coronary and was close to
death. There were two men on the
ambulance team—-one drove while
the other administered mouth to
mouth resuscitation.

“A policeman had to perform the

though he did a pretty good job, he
had difficulty because the ambu-
lance was bumping around. If he
had use of the seat he would not
have had nearly as much trouble."

Fryer has filed for a patent on the
seat but has no other plans for

“To ﬁnd solace in the past is to
ﬁnd cognizance of the present.
Trouble not those who study
history with prognostications un-
tempered by experience. Wisdom,
as Hermes found it, is enslaved by
time.

“It is often said that an old man
is a wise man. This is true for those
of noble blood. For ladies it is often
true. But those of baser natures,
those rufﬁan peasants who identify
with the lower beasts and animals
of the ﬁeld, are predisposed by
nature to avoid the teachings of
yesterday.

“Seek the histories. Listen full
to the tales of older and wiser men.
Seek 'the tales of time.”

Last weekend the Carnegie
Institute’s Medieval Festival drew
large crowds, Knights in armor
battled to the death, almost to the
death. The Heinz Chapel Choir
presented a liturgical drama, and
woodcutters, potters, weavers, and
minstrels demonstrated their skills.
It was a big success.

f1lm’s “identity crisis."

 
 
 

 

BY M.C. PILECKI

The film's heroine sums it up
best: “You win a few, you lost a
lot.”

That’s one way to describe the
identity crisis afflicting the Fiesta’s
new ﬂick Cinderella Liberty. At
ﬁrst it seems like another dramatic

" . look at the seamy side of life with

sailor John Baggs (James Caan)
wandering around Seattle's low
dives while on “Cinderella liberty”
(shore liberty that expires at
midnight). '

In one particularly low dive, he
meets up with hooker cum pool
hustler Maggie [Marsha Mason], a
kind of Super—Slut in her own right.

She affords quite a view while
leaning aver the pool table, and
lustily stuffs her earnings down her
ample cleavage. Baggs outhustles
her in a pool game, and wins her
for the night. And off they trot to
her grimy slum tenement ﬂat.

And now is introduced the
element that contributes to this

that Maggie has a son, a half-black
street-wise kid with rotting teeth
and a tough exterior, named Doug
(Kirk Calloway), after Douglas
MacArthur, of all people. The kid
stirs Bagg’s paternal feelings, and
tries to make like some kind of big
;brother to him while also playing
Big Daddy to Mama. 0

So this ﬁlm never does make up
its mind about what it is. It’s
certainly not a “seamy side of life”
excursion with all the pathos and
general family-style goo about the
old tough-slum-kid-responds-to-
love bit, which has been used into
the ground since the Dead End
Kids. And yo}; can hardly call an
R-rated ﬂick about rough. people

And the film never really goes
anywhere. Sure, Maggie goes full

earth-mother and back to slut, and
Dough goes through ‘an almost
unbelievable transformation, but
the fates of these characters are

hardly satisfying. And Baggy is too
static in continually being the
smart country boy with a good
heart. -
So there are serious deficiencies
in the story that make this less than
a really great ﬂick, but it's still not
too hard to watch. The acting
performances (except for Eli
Wallach’s typical over playing in a
character role) are quite good.
Caan is believable
accomplished at generating aud-
ience sympathy.

Marsha Mason has been _nomi-
nated for “Best Actress” in the
Academy Awards [if you care about
those things] for her excellent
portrayal of Maggie. lt’s not
exactly easy to take such a slattern,

who shamelessly neglects her son_

and her unborn child while
bedhopping with sailors, and make
her--if not likable--at least under-
standable. As characterized by
Mason, Maggie is not the evil
woman you’ve heard about in B
movies, but an immature, mixed--
up kid who has yet to grasp a
reality she can live with and not
somebody to hate.

As the mulatto son Doug, Kirk
Calloway steals a lot of scenes
(what kid doesn’t?), but without
falling into the trap of being too
“_cute," a usual failing with child
actors. His role is of course
predictable as soon as the kid first
pulls a knife on Bagg’s attempts to
be friendly, and as previously
stated it's his character that holds
back the film. But still he is
enjoyable to watch, and perhaps if

times he seems to take over Caan

Almost a year ago The Emmi-

of a band of Swedish peasants who
disenchanted with the hardships of
their native land, took the big step
in coming to the . “promised
land”--America.

The movie was rather long and
very slow-moving, and the English

dubbing from the film's original’

Swedish was disconcerting, to say
the least. But yet it had an
entrancing visual beauty linked
with the strongly human quality of
the drama, best exemplified in the
emmigrants’ tortuous sea journey.

the story could not. So now The
New Land, a “sequel" to The
Emmigrants (actually, the whole
thing was once one long movie and
released as such in Sweden, but
was chopped in half for American
distribution) rounds out the tile,
which focuses on Karl Oskar (Max
von Sydow), his Kristina (Liv
Ullmann) and their family.

But the second half of the saga
doesn’t quite measure up to the
first. The ratherchoppy series of
vignettes comprising the essen-
tially plotless story is often
confusing, even to one who can
remember most of what the first
half of the movie was about. As a

result, most of the incidents are -

under-developed, with too little

subjectivity’ to allow the characters
to gain some dimension.
And by this time most of the

characters
stereo-types:

have subsided into
Karl, the strong,

lean farmer who has a good heart

and a limited outlook; Kristina, the
good wife and mother who thinks of
little else, including herself; and
assorted narrow-minded neigh-
bors. The few time any of them has
a chance to break out of their
stifling molds, the story abruptly‘
changes and the audience is left up
in the air as to what is going on.

The only person allowed any
development, and insights, is
Karl’s younger brother Robert
(Eddie Axberg), remembered as
the dreamy, rebellious youth eager

larger crowds than ever; and the
Studio Theatre is producing three
times the number of shows it did
four years ago; and theatre is
supposedly dying in this country,
let alone Pittsburgh which is
getting a reputation as a tough
theatre city; and the American Film

right here in Pittsburgh.

Now, what's the Pitt Theatre
Department have to do with any of
these facts, and what’s it have to do
with professional theatre. and
what's it have to do with the future
of theatre in Pittsburgh?

Well, it has to do with the two
major goals of the Department.
First, there is their attempt to raise
the visibility of theatre within the
liberal arts program. In this
aspect, Pitt differs from CMU. Pitt
Theatre Department views theatre
as another perspective from which
to experience the educational
process. The Pitt department
continues to emphasize distribution

courses as it prepares its students
to step into the future pro-
fessionally, as teachers, or as
community theatre participants;
CMU stresses the professional
theatre aspect.

The Studio Theatre, using
student acting, student crews,
student directors, and advised by
the faculty, gives theatre arts
majors the practical experience
needed. It also provides the entire
University and community an
opportunity to appreciate drama at
a low cost. In Studio Theatre
productions, as in University of
Pittsburgh Theatre Productions,
the Department emphasizes high
dramatic standards. Dr. Attilio
Favorini, Coordinator for Theatre
Arts, believes that the success of
The Taming of the Shrew was proof
in itself that theatre audiences are
demanding and requesting chal-
lenge and quality‘ from today's
productions.

The second goal of the Depart-
ment is an attempt to fulﬁll that
which is lacking dramatically in the
Pittsburgh area. The ﬁrst area is
community theatre. Community
theatre in the Pittsburgh area is
popular and quite successful.
There are approximately thirty
community theatres in the area, not
all of which have the knowledgable
personnel to improve the quality of
their productions, or at least to
reach whatever dramatic goals they
have set. Also there is no
formalized, uniﬁed structure to the
community theatres. Therefore,
the University of Pittsburgh Thea-
tre Department and several repre-
sentatives of community theatre
are presently organizing the
theatres so that they may work
together to fulﬁll whatever gaps

§'©s 5 rice

exist in their productions. If
uniﬁed, then ideas, scripts, actors,
and props could be shared by the
theatres. The casting demands
could be met, and the overall
quality of the productions could be
raised. Besides their organizing
function, the Pitt Theatre Depart-
ment would express constructive
criticism and act as advisors if
necessary.

original adaptation of The Little '

In keeping with their established
community and theatre goals, the
Department is also planning a
schedule of documentary plays.
These plays will be presented in
accordance with historical events
such as the nation’s bicentennial in
1976. Productions such as these
would be beneﬁcial to other

"University departments like

history and sociology. Also, a play
such as an original, factual work
based on Pittsburgh would make
the theatre relevant to the working

time, would most likely increase
the theatre’s popularity and appeal
to -the too often ignored masses.

The Theatre Department of the .

University of Pittsburgh has set
several, sensible goals. The
present structural organization of
community theatre, the increased
attendance at the Studio Theatre
and University Theatre, and
Childsplay, are signs that he goals
of the Department are being met.
Evidently, the past history of poor
dramatic quality, snobbish atti-
tudes, and irrelevance won't

We have 26 meter maids with three
to four stationed in Oakland. They
write an average of 29,000 tickets a
month. They are not under a quota
system.”

COMMUTER BANDITS

In an effort to aid the Oakland
parker, the CA organized the
“Commuter Bandits.” The group,
depending on private
contributions, deposits coins in
expired meters. They claim their
donations come primarily from
drivers who have previously
benefited from the system.

Lauren Lindberg, chairman of
the Bandits, wrote a letter to
Cosetti in September, concerning
the legality of the group’s actions.
She received a reply from him six
months later.

“Although parkers may not
regard them as such, meters are a
tool to assist in enforcement and
allocation. The basic policy being
enforced is a limitation on the
number of hours which a parker
may stay. 4

“For example, Lindberg said,
“in a four hour zone, parkers are
not permitted to stay longer than
four hours even though they
deposit additional coins. It is
difficult for enforcement personnel
to determine that a parker has
overstayed the hour limit when
coins have been deposited.

“However, should the police
officer or meter maid determine
this is the case, a parker would
receive a ticket, even though coins
are deposited.” _

SOLUTIONS

Cosetti maintains “the long--

' range solution to the city’s parking

problem is buses and off-street
parking.”

While the fuel shortage is forcing
many motorists, including stu-
dents, to switch to public trans-
portation, additional off-street
parking in Oakland is still under
study.

The economic feasibility of
replacing Schenley Plaza with an
underground parking garage is
being considered. Latest reports
from the, Pittsburgh Parking
Authority show that a parking rate
of 30-40 cents per hour would be
necessary for such a garge to break
even.

This is a 50-100% increase over
the present meter charge of 20
cents per hour--a bigger dip into
the student’s pocket. '

Under such circumstances, stu-
dent car pools would appear more
economical. The problem then
would -be how to coordinate the
formation of car pools.

Presently, the CA conducts car
pool registration at the beginning
of each term, but it takes two-‘three
weeks for lists of drivers to be
compiled and mailed.

The groups has recently com-
bined efforts with KDKA’s “Com-
muter Computer." But, at this
point, it isn’t known how much of
an improvement.the new system
will be.

Though the University has an
Office of Residence Life and an
Office of Off-campus Housing,
there is no administrative branch
designed to serve commuters.

Although the CA has_ been

conducting many projects to aid

commuters, the group feels there is
definitely a need for an administra-
tive Office of Commuter Affiars.

The CA was told by Student
Affairs that the present budget
prevents the appointment of a
full-time staff member to handle
commuter affairs.

Despite this, some get major
improvements for commuters have
been made: _

--In an open lette_r last Decem-
ber, Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences Robert Marshall,
invited commuters with transpor-
tation and closed-course prob-
lems--causing them to leave or
arrive home at unreasonably early
or late hours--to notify his office
before winter term began.

-—An appeals committee. in
cooperation with the CA, was to be
established to hear such cases, but
lack of commuter response post-

poned these plans.

Newly elected CA President Bob
Heister attributes the system’s
poor start to “lack of publicity.”
The CA is planning to publicize the
offer this term. Heister added he
would like to see the offer extended
to all schools--not just CAS.

To insure the safety of students
parking in Panther Hollow, Dr.
Coble, executive assistant to
Chancellor Posvar and Director of
Health, Safety and Parking Joseph
Gil, agreed to the installation of
security-call’ boxes in the area and
rerouting of the campus police
patrol to include the Hollow.

Despite improvements, Heister
concluded three major needs
remain: over-night facilities,
pavement of the Trees Hall parking
lot, and improvement of commuter

Some people thought the Pitt basketball team wouldn't lose again in
the regular season. The way the loss came about left many people with
knotted stomachs.

A rundown of the situation will explain the irregularities which led to
the Pitt defeat. .

Let’s start with the clock. Penn State coach John Bach complained
after his loss in Pittsburgh last month that Pitt should invest some
money in its scoreboard. Due to a malfunction in the Field House
clock, the score could not be kept on the board. What happened at Rec

Hall was much worse, due to the way it was handled.

A timeout was called with 5:06 left in the game and Pitt leading,
59-58. When play resumed, the clock read 4:06. The error was
discovered and corrected by the official timer, who personally halted

. play, something totally illegal, after six seconds of play, but the six

seconds were not added on. Although nobody could foresee which
team that would benefit, it turned out that it wasn’t Pitt.
The clock worked properly for the rest of the game, and after Penn A

State tied the game with 1:34 to go, Pitt decided to work for the last _

shot.

The Nittany Lions had commited only four team fouls at the time, so
they could foul and not send a Panther to the charity stripe.

With 19 seconds left, Ron Brown slammed hard into Keith Starr’s
face, knocking him backwards, clearly a deliberate foul.

Referee Jim Hernjack did not send Starr to the foul line, but gave
Pitt the ball on the side. With six seconds to go, Billy Knight received
a pass and before he could dribble was called for traveling. Brown's
desparation jumper ended Pitt's 22-game winning streak.

Ironically, Hern_iack was a last minute replacement as ofﬁcial. He
made both crucial calls. Ridl was asked if Hernjack was a friend of

,Bach’s, ‘‘I think they're related,” said Ridl.

“It would have been different if we’d have been blown out,” sighed
Ridl. The loss to Penn State will not affect Pitt’s post season plans, as
an NCAA bid should be forthcoming tomorrow momlng at 9:30 am.
The outcome of tonight’s South Carolina game will not be a factor

, either.

The Panthers are currently ranked 11th by both wire services, and
even a third loss (to South Carolina) would still leave Pitt with the best
record in the East.

It’s not common to bicker over little points, but it's not common for

After being thrown to the Lions
Saturday, the Pitt basketball team
finds itself under_ pressure by the
fiery South Carolina Gamecocks
tonight at 8:00. The game will be
televised on WTAE (channel 4).

Penn State dealt the Panthers
their first loss since December 1
Saturday, winning 66-64 on a last
second. Ron Brown jump shot that
still has everybody buzzing.

Buzz Ridl, Pitt basketball coach,
can't dwell on the PSU game any
longer, as he will have his hands
full with the Gamecocks tonight.

Under veteran coach Frank
McGuire, South Carolina has made
annual visits to post-season tour-
naments, and had not lost at home

  Rosters on 13

in two years until Notre Dame beat
them this month.

McGuire felt that if he could beat
Duquesne at the Civic Arena last
Sunday (which he did), that the
Gamecocks would make the NCAA
tourney.

USC is now ranked 14th in the

(AP poll, three places behind Pitt.

Sporting an 18-4 mark, McGuire is
confident his team will receive an
at-large bid.
Also confident of a bid is Ridl.

“There aren’t very many teams
with a record better than ours,” he

said at Monday’s basketball

luncheon.
invited.”
The bids will be officially
extended at 9:30 tomorrow morn-
ing, as the Panthers are preparing
to return from Columbia. The
selection committee is meeting this
afternoon to pick the teams, long
before tonight’s opening tap-off.

. South Carolina was placed in the
NCAA Midwest regionals last year,
and may end up there again. If
they make it to the Eastern
regionals, they could meet Pitt, but
not in the ﬁrst game.

Coast Conference after the.1971
season, but have continued to play
the top-notch ball associated with
the ACC. '

Starting three sophomores and a
freshman, USC convincingly
thumped Duquesne here Sunday,
67-57.

The only starting senior is a 6-5
guard Brian Winters, a streak
shooter who can connect from all
over the court. An 80% free throw
shooter, Winters was eight for
eight from the charity stripe
Sunday.

Sophomore Mike Dunleavy, a
New Yorker like Winters, also
shoots like him. The 6-2 playmaker
sinks 82% of his free throws, and
didn’t miss on four attempts
Sunday.

“If we don’t give their gruards
trouble, they’l1 blow us out of the
building," warned Ridl. V

The Gamecocks don’t have a
really big man (like Pitt), but start
three strong leapers atforward.

Bob Mathias and Alex English, a
couple of 6-8ers, do most of the
heavywork, while 6-4 freshman
Nate Davis is the more mobile type.

Assistant USC coach Don Walsh
revealed that the Gamecocks
played a zone defense the entire
game for the first time against the
Dukes. “We had to because of
Lionel Billingy," he said. Billingy
is Duquesne’s 6-9 center who
scored 18 points Sunday.

South Carolina employs a basic
3-2 zone defense, one which is
quite difficult to penetrate.

“We’re not going to get inside
tonight,” said Ridl. “We’ll have to

be making the short jumpers. If we
do, we’ll have some fun. If we’re
not shooting well, we’ll be hoping
the game ends early.”

While the Panthers may be
hoping the game ends early, Ridl is
certain that the season will not.

Virginia will not be Pitt’s last

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS--

If it weren't for its Crosstown
rival, Southern California would be
the best college basketball team in
Los Angeles.

But, although USC has played
second fiddle for most of the past
10 years to UCLA, the nation’s
basketball virtuoso, the Trojans are
on the rise and have cracked the
Top Ten in the Associated Press
College Basketball Poll.

Two weeks ago USC was ranked
No. 13 to UCLA's No. 1,.

A week ago, when UCLA made
the headlines by losing consecutive
games to Oregon State and
Oregon, dropping to No. 3 in the
rankings, USC beat both Oregon
schools and crept to a No. 12
ranking.

In today's AP Poll the Bruins
have clung to their No. 3 spot after
convincing victories over Wash-
ington State and Washington,
while the Trojans moved into the
No. 10 spot after whipping
Washington 79-64 and Washington

   

USC has won six straight games
since suffering a 65-54 loss to
UCLA Feb. 2 on the Bruins’ home
court. ‘ ._

Both schools have 9-2 records in
the Pac-8 Conference and take
turns playing California and
Stanford this weekend as tune-ups
for their March 9 battle at USC’s
Sports Arena. _

Barring an upset this weekend,
the March 9th game--the last one in
the regular season for both UCLA
and USC--will determine the
Pac-8's representative in the
NCAA Tournament.

The only way UCLA can make it
to the NCAA’s and try for its 10th
title in 11 years is to finish first in
the Pac-8.

North Carolina State, 22-1 with
29 first-place votes, stood atop the
rankings for the second week in a
row after knocking off Duke 113-87
and slipping by Clemson 80-75.

Notre Dame, 22-1, marked
Western Michigan 85-68 and West

Wolllen Gymnasts Fare

well At Ohio State.

BY KEVIN NOWE

The women's gymnastics team.
traveled to Columbus Saturday,
and despite the less than sufficient
playing conditions, fared well in a
dual meet involving Ohio State and
Illinois State. in a 4‘/2 hour
marathon, in a freezing cold
gymnasium, the women captured
two first places, but ended up at
the botton in team scoring.

The reason for such a low scoring
performance was the lack of
sufﬁcient back-up scoring. Ohio
State accumulated 82.80 points,
primarily because of their back-up
scores, while they only captured
the laurels in one event. In the
dual meet, Pitt was matched up
against Illinois State and Ohio State
in individual scoring.

Against Illinois State, the women
captured a first in the vaulting
event with Kathy Krynock scoring
a very high 8.45. Donna DeMarino
won the floor exercise with an 8.2.
She also captured a second in the
uneven parallel bars and another
second in the balance beam.
Illinois State won the honors in the
beam and unevens competition,
and took second and third in the
floor exercise and vaulting.

The competition against OSU
was basically the same, with the
Pitt women capturing first in the

vaulting, balance beam, and the
floor exercise. Bonnie Micochero
of OSU combined an original and
beautiful performance to capture
the uneven event with a score of
7.85.

The final score of the dual meet
was: Ohio State, 82.80; Illinois
State, 79.60; and Pitt, 69.05.
Captain DeMarino explained that
the team's performance was less
than adequate because of the lack
of competition in this year's
schedule. “Our younger girls were
intimidated by the largeness of
Ohio State. They kind of lost the
conﬁdence that we built up through
the year."

Another factor involved in the
double defeat was the fact that this
was only the second away meet for
the squad. “When you work on the
same equipment all year, it’s tough
to adjust to new equipment.”

A plus factor for the girls in this
meet was the nature of the judging.

Delene Darst, an international
judge, was the superior judge of
the meet, and the criticism that the
team had not proven its worth with
fair judging was laid to rest.

The women’s gymnastics team,
5-5, will compete in the state meet
at Lock Haven. The purpose of the
meet is to determine an All-State
team.

Piranhas Travel To Eastern 3

members of the Pitt

and Slippery Rock. The big meet

E will be held in the Art Linkletter
” Naratorium of Springﬁeld College,
‘ Springﬁeld. Mass.

Approximately 30 schools are

. "expected to compete in the meet.

Among the contenders are Clarion,

V" Glassboro State and ‘73 Eastern

Champs. West Chester State. The

,Ivy League swimmers are among

the best, but the state schools
usually enter more swimmers.
Pitt freshman, Angie Lopez, who

. qualified by large margins for the-

meet will not be able to make the

Rico in the Central American

return in time to make the trip to
Penn State with the six other Pitt
qualiﬁers.
pionship meet will be held March
14-16 at State College, Pa.

Coach Virginia Grindle feels that
the Pitt relays have excellent
chances to place in the finals, that
is, the top six places. The 200 yd.
and 400 yd. medley relays will be
composed of Mickey Chamberlain,
backstroke, Annamarie Crelli,
breaststroke, Sue Price, butterﬂy
and either Mamie Heretick,
Glynnis Lyons or Vickie Coleman in
the freestyle leg of the relay.

Swimming in the 200 yd and 400
yd freestyle relays will be four of
the following: Anne- Wallisch,
Coleman, Heretick, Lyons or Price.
The final line-up for the relays will
be decided later by Coach Grindle.

“The grils girls who went to
Easterns last year should be a great
help to the new girls. We know
what to expect this year and have
been training accordingly.”

Team Captain Heretick placed
eleventh in 200 yd freestyle event
last year. Her times in the 200 and
100 yd freestyle have been
dropping consistently all season.
Championship meets are not really
new -to Heretick, as she has
competed in state championships
and Easterns last year. She is
hopeful of still bettering her times
and copping some points for Pitt
this weekend.

Co-captain Price just missed
consolation ﬁnals (places 7 through
12) last year in the 50 yd ﬂy and
hopes to do better this time. She,
too, has bettered her time this year
and should benefit from last year's
experience. as it was her first
competition in a really big meet.

Senior Annamarie Crelli, known
by her teammates for “keeping her
cool" is also hopeful of bettering
last year's showing in the 50 and
100 yd breaststroke. She missed
consolations by a narrow margin (in

Football Strike
Predicted

BY WILL GRIMSLEY
AP SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

ROTONDA, Fla. AP - It may
look silly for a $150,000-a-year
football player to be carrying
around a picket sign but it’s quite
probable this year, says O.J.
Simpson, and the public will be all
for it.

“I think there’s a good chance of
a strike in the National Football
League,” the ball carrying star of
the Buffalo Bills said Monday.
“The players are ready for some
changes.” ,

Simpson, a contender in the
$123,000 Superstar ﬁnals here,
said the greatest objections are to
the so-called Rozelle rule requiring
compensation for the victimized
club when an athlete plays out his
option and signs with another
team.

“The players should be given
greater freedom,” headded, 
think we may be nearirigllalhpointd
that a player may be completely
freed at the end of his contract,
with no option clauses.”

The 6-foot-2, 214-pound former
Heisman Trophy winner from

Southern California who set a

season rushing record last year
with 2,003 yards, said he is not a
member of the NFL Players
Association but is in full agreement
with the group’s aims.

The rushing star spiked the
theory that the public might resent
a players’ strike.

“I don’t think so at all,” he
insisted. “Our life styles have
changed and people have a more
realistic concept of what and who
we are. If athletes can be asked not
to cross a picket line when a worker
or some union strikes, why
shouldn’t the athletes be allowed to
enjoy the same privilege?”

He also denied that the public is
getting disenchanted -with es-
calating sports salaries.

“All the fan cares about is seeing
a good game,” he said. “He
doesn’t give a darn what kind of
salaries we are making.”

Simpson said he always had
admired and supported Com,-
missioner Pete Rozelle, but feels
the cards are generally - stacked
against individuals.

What enhances the pride of a
winning team? Is it the personal
motivation of the individual team
members, or is it just plain desire
to always be on top of the
competition or is it the personnel?
In the days of the heralded rise of
the Pitt basketball team and the
‘Major’ change that occurred in the
fall, the Fencing Club at the
University has received little if any
publicity. The motivation to victory
and the desire of the team is not for
personal gain or headlines in the
local newspapers. The winning
ways of the very young Fencing
.Club is encompassed in the coach.
Coach Stella. Saurer has a long
list of successful ventures in
fencing and holds no regrets about
telling the story as it should be
She was a Panamanian

competition.
Saurer was intrigued with the

' University when she started here in

1972 with the Latin American
Bilingual Department. In the fall of
1973 Saurer began teaching fen-
cing at Pitt, and the Fencing (lub,
this past month, was recognized by
the University as an ofﬁcial club.

The Fencing Club is financed by
the Physical Education Depart-
ment. and consists mainly of

students enrolled in the basic
fencing classes. “The majority of
my students,” explained Saurer,
“are freshmen or novices. But, at
the rate they are improving, we
should be ready for Varsity
competition next season.”

Margaret Covert, Women’s Ath-
letic Co-ordinator, has pushed the
issue about varsity recognition and
was responsible for the acquisition
of the fencing jackets. Saurer
believes that this type of support
from such individuals could be
most effective in their quest for
inter-collegiate competition.

In recent competition, the
Fencing Club showed extremely
well in a ﬁeld of 40. David
Schwartz, a senior and the only
experienced member of the team,
earned a bronze medal in the

Intermediate Oass.‘ Freshmen

Ronald Propatich won a silver
medal and sophomore Nathan

Pringle won a bronze in the Begin-
ners Class. ‘ '

Prior to this match, the Fencing 

Club met Indiana in an exhibition
match and outscored them 11
victories to 5. “One member that I
am impressed with,” stated
Saurer, “is Dave Stankus.” She
believes. that Stankus has the
potential to become one of the top
fencers ‘in the nation. “He has

beautiful style and he has only

been fencing for two months.”

stated Saurer, “and like other
sports it takes a lot of work and
sacriﬁce.” The skills that are to be
developed in a good fencer are
stamina, timing, and muscle
co-ordination. ,

As a coach, Saurer can see the
product of her labors. “I’ve
received Iessonsallmy Iifeandnow
Iwantmymemberstohavethe
same sort of instructions that I have
received.” Her only._ regret is that
because she has developed them
strong enough, she is not always
assured a victory against them.

The credentials of Saurer are
more than sufﬁcient. In 1955, she
wasthe National Champ in Mexico
City. In 1962 and 1967 she was a

member of the team that won the ' I 1?

national championships. On March

10, she will be participating in the e 
'Regionals, in hopes of securing a ' "

berth with the National team.

It is this same tested winning 

spirit that guides the’ Fencing Club
and shows promise of one day
becoming a national fencing power..
“I hope,” explains Saurer, “that
we can develop a team that can win
medals for the University.” She
adds that she desires to develop

‘Olympic material, that they might .

one day be winners for the USA.»

The next competition for the
Fencing Club will be March 16 at
Trees Hall, starting at 9:30 am.

NEARSIGHTED?

The ad reproduced below was run recently in several optometric journals to
inform. optome_tri'sts about a. new development in the treatment and prevention
of myopia. If you wish to do somethi'ng about your myopia, show this ad to your
optometrist who will order a Myopter for you and assist you in using it.

Some Candid Words. About
AIVIYOPIA AND THE IVIYCDPTER

 

The cause of Myopia

The old “heredity" or "structural defect” theory of myopia
can no longer be adequately defended. As reported in sev-
eral journals, studies made in recent years have shown
beyond any doubt that acquired myopia is caused by
excessive close work.‘

The eye is adapted by nature primarily for distant use and
is at rest when so used. It is not designed for a continuous
accommodative effort. When abused in this way, a chronic
ciliary spasm, or in other words a change in the level of
accommodation, frequently results. This is often followed
by a lengthening of the eyeball. The usual practice of
putting concave glasses on a myopic patient, and then
permitting those glasses to be used for reading, increases
the ciliary spasm, and causes the vision_to deteriorate
further. Each time the glasses are strengthened, every-
thing the patient sees is in effect brought closer, and the
eyes adapt to the new conditions, either by a further con-

‘ traction of the ciliary muscle, or by a further lengthening

of the eye. The patient thus becomes more and more
dependent on glasses.

It is now believed that this elongation results from a pres-
sure rise in the vitreous caused by excessive accommoda-
tion. lf accommodation is sustained for long periods, this
pressure can result in an enlargement of the vitreous
chamber, with a resulting stretching of the coats of the
eye. The lengthening is preceded by and is associated with
the ciliary spasm. Some eyes continue this lengthening
until detachment of the retina occurs.

The Myopter -

The Myopter is a light-weight viewer worn instead of
glasses for reading. It eliminates accommodation, con-
vergence and stereopsis and thus completely transforms
close work into distant work.

Light from the viewed obect enters the front and is split

into two identical parts which are reflected into the eyes v

parallel, eliminating convergence and stereopsis. The ac-
commodation is eliminated by taking the housing apart
and inserting lenses about 3D. less concave than the pa-
tient's regular distance prescription. For example, a pa-
tient with normal vision could use +3D. lenses in the

Myopter. This moves the far point to 33 cm from the eyes.
lf the book is held slightly beyond this point so the words
are a little blurred, the ciliary muscles are forced to relax
»as they attempt to see this blurredimage clearly. This
method has a. much stronger beneficial effect on the
spasm than using lenses which merely eliminate part of
the accommodation. Recent clinical tests with the Myopter
prove that myopia can be halted and improved with this
technique. improvements of up to 1D. have been noted
after only a few weeks’ use.

As the vision improves, the patient will find that the book
must be held farther and farther away to get a blurred
image. When this reading position becomes uncomfortable,
the Myopter lenses are changed so that the book can be
held closer. When normal vision is regained, a, distance
correction is no longer needed but the Myopter should
still be used for all prolonged close work. ’

With age, the eyes become less responsive to the harmful
effects of excessive accommodation, and the use of the
Myopter~can probably be discontinued. It is during the
childhood years, when the eyes are so adaptable, that they
must be protected from this accommodation.

The Myopter has other applications than the treatment of
myopia. One use is by persons who have difficulty main-
taining convergence when reading. The viewer can be used
to eliminate the need to converge. The patient is supplied
with Myopter lenses that permit reading without the need
to accommodate, thus keeping the normal relationship
between accommodation, convergence and stereopsis. An-
other use is by presbyopes. The usual reading glasses
enable these patients to read without the need to accom-
modate, but convergence is still required. The normal ac-
commodation/convergence relationship is altered and prob-
lems are experienced. Usingthe Myopter, the patient can
read without accommodation or convergence.

Attempts have been made in the past to slow the progress
of myopia by using reading glasses or bifocals to reduce
the accommodation when reading. This valuable technique
is preferable to the usual use of the full distance correc-
tion for reading. However, the method has serious limita-
tions for the following reason. When normal eyes look at a
distant object, there is no accommodation, no convergence

_ and no stereopsis. As the object comes closer, these three

factors increase in proportion to each other. in fact, this
relationship is so important to proper eye function that
accommodation and convergence strongly stimulate each
other. Now, it is obvious that if suitable lenses are used
to eliminate accommodation for reading, the eyes still
converge on the book. This convergence is attempting to
increase the accommodation at the same time as the read-
ing glasses are attempting to eliminate it. The ciliary
muscle is being stimulated in two different and opposite
directions at the same time——a completely unnatural con-
dition. Naturally, it is not surprising if the resulting eye-
strain prevents improvement’in the vision, even though
the_ accommodation has apparently been eliminated. Also,
fusion problems can be created.

Attempts have been made to eliminate the convergence
also, by combining base-in prisms with the spherical read-
ing glasses, but this also is not entirely satisfactory. First
of all, ‘such prisms must be quite strong and they produce
distortion, causing eyestrain. Secondly, the prisms do not
eliminate stereopsis. Each eye still sees a different pic-
ture and the brain associates this 3-dimensional effect
with_ close vision, not distance vision. The resulting eye-
strain can prevent improvement in the vision. The Myopter
overcomes all these _limitations and allows the patient to
read_with the eyes in a completely natural and relaxed
condition, as if looking at a far distant object.

Inform your patients of what is now known about myopia
and of what treatment is available. Children, especially,
should be put on a myopia prevention program as soon
as myopic tendencies are observed.

Ordering Instructions

The price of the Myopter is $49.95sincIuding elastic strap
and detailed instruction manual. Section 1 of the manual
discusses myopia and its cause in simple language that
the patient can understand. Section 2 gives instructions
to the practitioner on how to use the Myopter. The re-
placeable 20 mm diameter lenses may be ordered in 13
powers (including plano) from —3D. to +3D. in 1/2 diopter
steps at $7.00/pair.

Use the Myopter free_- for so days. If not satisfied that it
can help your myoptic patients, return it without charge.
