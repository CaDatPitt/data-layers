Foreign Group’
Plans Meeting  

Foreign Student Service
committee chairman, Carroll
Smith, has sent a letter to all
foreign students not already
on the committee to acquaint

them with the goals of the.

committee and has .invited them
to join. Interested American stu-
dents may also attend the next
meeting and join the committee.

The goal of the committee, ac-
cording to Miss Smith, is “the
promotion of the exchange of cul-
ture and ideas among the foreign
and the American students.”

The original proposal for the
committee_ calls for “suggestions
for "helping the foreign students
become an integral part of the
student body and to stop the se-
gregation which has become about
due to the lack of any organized
effort to draw them into the com-
munity.” I

The committee is under the
auspices of ‘Student Govern-
ment, but is also closely affili-
ated with the YMCA, YWCA,
Associated .Women Students,
Men's Dormitory Council, Pitts-
burgh Council for International
‘Visitors, and the Office of Cul-
tural and Educational Exchange
of the University.

There are three branches of the
committee, which is actually a
programming committee, each
dealing with one of three major
programs.

The orientation branch will
serve to help acquaint the new
foreign students to the University
campus and society. The Brother-

Sister Program is a subcommittee .

of this branch. Under this pro-
gram “foreign and American stu-
dents will work together on an in-
dividual basis,” stated Miss Smith.

¢Litchﬁeld, during an intefview
this week. “The boys must learn
to be leaders on their own‘ and
not to rely on the coach’s judg-
ment all the time. This is one of
the aims of our education system
here.”

Litchﬁeld admitted that 'Mich-
elosen did not do this as a
practice. “Some games he
didn’t do it at all,” he explained.
“Then other times he had those
two fullbacks (Rick) Leeson
and (John) Telesky wearing
themselves out going in‘ and out
with plays.

“I want leadership on

This edict was one of two un-
written clauses in another unwrit-
ten contract that calls for Mich-
elosen to coach here again in 1963.

Knowing Which Way to Go

Leadership, according to a fun-
book called “The Yankee Doodle
Dictionary,” is “the art of simul-

‘The Death Of, Bessie Smith’. 
Slated For Winter Program

The University Theater’s “Theater 11” will.prod'uce Ed-

ward Albee’s “The Death of Bessie Smith” for its winter-
»_program. ‘ ' ’

s

The case will include: Harriet Allan, nurse; »‘Norrnan_
Buchsbaum, intern; Luddy Hayden, Bernie; Larry Heller,

father; Ruthie Katz, second nurse; Ronald Mitchell, Jack;

and Clayton Weathersby as on orderly.

John H. Ulrich, Director of theé

University ‘Theater, will direct the
production, with Eleanor .Wein-
berger as his [Assistant Director.
The technical crew will be direct-
ed by Philip Eck of the Speech
Department.

The play is based on the death"
of Bessie Smith, a Negro blues
singer who died in an automobile
accident in 1937. Albee has used
the circumstances surrounding her
death to form an altered,‘ enlarged
play concerning human emotions
and prejudices. In this form we
view the characters involved in
the death of Negro Bessie who
dies because she is unable to gain

Bessie herself never, appears
and situation is grasped through
the others involved.

Ulrich describes the play as ‘-‘an

realistic form of the theater of, the
absurd that Albee‘ usually gives,

tic play.” -J

Albee is currently receiving-
plaudits for his latest play, “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” now
on Broadway. Hehas also written
“The Zoo Story” and “The Sand-
box,” boththeater of the absurd.

The play will be shown Feb. 13,

For Encouraging Leadership

out and see the games,” asserted
Litchﬁeld.

Attendance Disturbing

The Chancellor also said he was
disturbed with the sagging at-
tendance, especially the 23,000
ﬁgure for the Homecoming Game
against Syracuse.

“I'm not worried because of
- the gate receipts,” he said. "I

don't worry about the money.
We must get an identiﬁcation
with the institution. This is one
reason for having big-time
sports.

-“Some members of the admin-

.istration think this is a modest
.identiflcation,” he added, “but I

think it is very important.
Responsible For Everything
“To me, what goes on in foot-

ball is like what goes on in the

~- dental -school, in the law school,

or in the Student Union. It is part
of my responsibility as chancellor

V of this university.”

When questioned about his
competency to judge the vagar-
ies of football, Litchﬁeld re-
plied, “If I’m not competent to
make a iudgment on anything
here, then I don't belong here.

“It's perfectly clear that he's
playing ultra-conservative foot-
ball. He’s playing for the sake
of winnin-g alone and not for the
pleasure of the fans.”

How Will Be Know?

How will Litchﬁeld determine
wehther the attack is wide-open?
“The same way all those who
didn’t come to Homecoming, and
all those enthusiasts who know
anything about it at all, will
know. '

“You don’t need a football
background to see,” he ‘said.
“I don’t have to have been an

All-American end in-1923-24
and 25 to know what this game’s
all about.

“Since I have been here we
have increased scholarship aid to
the football team,” he noted.
“And I know who we can get and
who we can’t get. We should have

been better than ﬁve and five.

with our material. I certainly
think so, and so did our compe-
tition.” .

Repeating his twc—point plan
for the fall, he said, “These are
the things I want done. If John
doesn’t do it, well . . .”

What would this mean if Mich-
closen does not open up? “What
it means to anyone who doesn’t
do what the institution wants him
to do,” Litchﬁeld replied. “It's
inevitable. It’s just a matter of
policy. I think John will play
differently this coming year.”

The Graduate Library Science
department has started a series of
“coffee hours” and luncheons as
a method of solving the problem
of providing a way for students
and faculty to meet outside the
classroom for discussing various
topics.

The "coffee hours” are informal
affairs held at lunch time with
everyone bringing their own food.
Here students, faculty, and any
guests can talk about anything
from ”books to baby diapers” ac-
cording to Mr. Ronald Wiley.
Each month there are two or
three “coffee hours”-planned.

“Since these two ways of bring-
ing the students and faculty to-
gether have been ‘so successful
for our schoql,” said Wiley, “we
would suggest thatother groups
consider these solutions to the
problem.”

AFTER 19 MONTHS or internal
and external study, the Board of

Directors of Texas A & M College —

has issued a “Blueprint for Pro-
gress” to. guide development of

the institution until; its 100th an-~

Meters Around Cathedral Rumored

so Tackles Parking

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor of student and
general affairs; Lawrence L. Monnett, assistant chancellor-
of business affairs; William .G. Fisher, director of the physical
plan; and Peter Bijur, senate chairman of the Student Gov-
ernment parking committee met last Friday to discuss the

A

Oakland parking situation. v

The meeting was called as a re-
sult of SC interests in the rumors
the city’s installation
of parking meters around the
University, including Bigelow
Blvd. in front of the Cathedral.

No "Final Decisions

Monnett stated at the meeting,
that as far as_ the administration
knows, the city council has --dis-
cussed only installing meters on
Bellfield Ave. and in the Schenley
Park Plaza, and that no final de-
cisions were made.

“Th e Student Government
parking committee will see to it
that the student's point of view
is presented and listened to by
the city officials if they decide
to install meters,” Bijur stated.

Reasons for installing the me-
ters are to discourage downtown
workers from parking in Oakland,
and to prevent out of town stu-
dents from leaving their cars in
front of the Cathedral for weeks
at a time. .

Bad Situation

“The situation is a bad and
serious one,” Bijur commented.
“The era of l'ree parking has past
and we must realize this. The
University is using every-‘bit of
available space for parking,facili-
ties, and is definitely making ev-
ery effort to better parking con-
ditions. But, the problem lies with
a general lack oliispace.” ,

The committee agreed that at
present, the University does not
have enough space to accommo-
date the numberot‘ cars that
come into‘ the area'daily.

According to Monnett, 1,100
spaces for faculty and administra-
tive parking are located through-
out the campus.

Parking Available

Student parking is available be-
hind the Masonic Temple off Fifth
Ave. and in the O’I-lara Parking
Plaza.

Funny Fortune? i 

Two new lots for students and
faculty open this spring. One,
a 100 car lot, is at Darragh at
Terrace St., the other, near
Mellon Institute will accommo-
date 40 cars.

Under the new residence halls,
students may park 75 cars. The
car lot under Schenley Quadrangle
is scheduled for re-opening.

All of these areas are scheduled
for opening by September 1963.

Next year, 150 cars will park in
the Board of Education lot and in
a lot where the Schenley Theater
stood.

Bijur asked about additional
underground parking. The com-
mittee told him that construction
of underground parking lots costs
over $3,000 per square, _and that
the returns from them probably
would not sufficiently cover the
cost of construction.

Eship on the gridirontindicates once again that he is a man
_who knows how to be a leader.

‘ Since the Chancellor assumedhis duties at the Univer-
;sity, the school has felt many changes that have the mark-
[ings' of his particular type of leadership. A dynamic man

make the new institutions here dynamic. What he has most
recently called for is dynamic football. '

2 Dr. Litchﬁeld enjoys and encourages any type of com-
petition; he has stated this on several occasions. His en-
thusiasm at the football games, well known among the stu-
dents, "is another statement of his love for that kind of com-
petition.

“But he has shared, open disappointment, along with the
students, with the results of footballing at the University.
1, With the typical Litchﬁeld verve, he has seized the
problem and called‘ the answer the way he sees it. The

is typical, too; he has been criticized for his statements, but
has also been praised in’many corners. » .

‘First is the question of Coach Michelosen. At the end of
the season, the usual rumors about the.Coach’s future were

 dissatisﬁed varsity men were wide-spread’.

A But the Chancellor had the ﬁnal word. He wants the
«Coachlto coach but he wants the players to lead. This
.‘ deceptively simple request not only sounds logical to us
but ‘also seems to characterize what collegiate football
‘should be, as opposed to professional ball.

Secondly, the administrator has called for “wide-open
football.” It is felt here that the wide-open attack is an
ambitious, if not risky idea. But so are a lot of Litchfie1d’s
ideas; ‘If we wish to continue to play the kind of teams we
-have, then suchvplatying will be necessary.

Itwould, at least, create some exciting football. That’s
‘what the Chancellor wants. That’s what we want. The pos-
sibilities are wide-open.

Prognostications have been ﬂying thick and fast
the last two ‘weeks as everyipolitical writer in the
nation is gazing into his crystal ball and trying,
perhaps in vain, to predict, with great solemnity,
the future political developments \
at home’ and abroad. Many of 
these predictions‘ fail to-take into
account ' the change of institu-
tions, and rather deal only with
men. For instance, De'Gaulle’s’
stubborness, Khrushchev’s anxi- '

cerns. All of thgis is true, but for 

things as .thé'y might be, we 2
should look to the changes’ in-the_
world’s-institutions. ' _ V . _ '
As and institution, the United Nations i is be-
coming moré responsive to the problems of‘ the
times. It is ﬁrmer in dealing wi‘th"crises, such as
Katanga and the Congo, and is a more representa-
tive sounding board for world opinion. -This stems,
I think, from two reasons: ﬁrst, the enrollment of
many new, independent states ‘into the U.N. makes

 

this body more pluralistic and diverse; and second, -~

the Cuban crisis proved the effectiveness of the
United Nations as a source of world opinion --at.

work. These two developments, one of growth and _

one of sudden importance,’ canvbeneﬁt us in -the
long run.
Pluralisﬁc World _ V
This is because wehave, ‘as our long-range ob-
jective, the concept of a pluralistic world, diverse
and at peace atthe‘ same time. Further,- there is no
other appropriate place or organization for a speech
like Ambassador Steven,so'n’s. No other group can
reﬂect and represent the world’s leadership so well’.
Therefore, the increasing strength of the United
Nations as a world institution is a healthy sign for

in the true sense of theword, he has always attempted to. 3 our future‘

Another. institution which is changing is the
European community.’ -Here -I- am encompassing.
NATO and the Common Market. Here there are

two major developments at work: first, greater.

By Jim Kleinberg

unity among the European with the United States
powers on political and economic levels; and
second, a desire to break away from the protective
umbrella of the United States and operate more in-
depently. Rather than‘ being in ‘contradiction to
each other, as it .may appear, these developments
are actually reinforcing one another. Economic
growth and prosperity are enabling the European
nations to “go it alone’?, and, vice versa, this inde-
pendence from~the United States reinforces the
“Europeaness” of their political and economic com-

—. munity.

’ One of the major problems of ourforeign policy,

' then, is meeting?" and [adjusting "to this ‘develop-

mental change in Europe, We have offered Polaris

. missiles’, to’ the French,’ but they_.have been re- V
jected largely. because France wishes to develop

her own nuclear force. Similarly, the dropping 01

pSk_ybolt was a blow to the British because it under-

cut their plans for military independence from us.

We want ptoremove our forces in Europe and have.
the Europeans shoulder a more_ equitable share of

the NATO burden. Strangely enough, if we did re-

= ‘move’ these troops, there probably would be a great

cry of “desertio_'n and abandonment?’ from across

-the Atlantic. This institution will,be"diﬂﬁcu1t‘_t‘o
‘deal with, but offers enormous possibilities for

Free World strength.
Entities in Themselves

Indeed, both of these institutions, the United
Nations and the European! Community, prove the
need for examining the -organizations of-the world

-A ‘as’ tangible entities in thernselves. The complexi-
ties of the modern world have endowedinstitutions‘
with_ resourcesof manpower, skill, and a dynamism ’

all their own. In our lifetimes Khrushchev, Nehru,

“De Gaulle, Macmillan, and Mao all will die. But

their institutions -will persist. To deal with_the
changes of these, institutions, and to deal with
their intrinsic lifeblood, not; just their men, is the
challenge of our world. of diplomacy and foreign
affairs. Not to deal with them is committing a

‘gross error, especially when one is in the ﬁeld of

prediction and hypothesis.‘

The Unse|ec’rive Library

. ’By Gwen ‘Visser

“A $1000 ‘Amy~ Loveman ‘National Award is
again being oifered to a college senior who.‘ has
collected an outstanding personal l1'.brary.”——The
Pitt News. .

I think that it is perfectly delightful that Amy
Loveman has her name attached to ‘an award for
an outstanding personal library, but I am also quite

relieved to see that the award applies only to col- -

lege seniors. Otherwise, I, as'a
Freshman-and-a-half,~ and my
books, as my personal library,
would be suffering -from a gi— .
gantic inferiority complex.

The criteria for selecting the
most outstanding collection will
be based on “intelligent interest, 2
scope and imagination,” but I i
am afraid that my collection has ,
gone slightly overboard on the 
scope and imagination parts, and 3
doesn’t include enough of the
intelligent interest.

Toss Out Half

,In addition to promoting book sales, the pur--

pose of the award undoubtedly is also to stimulate
alittle more interest and pride on the part of the
student’s attitude toward collecting, books.

Unfortunately, though, I now feel thatperhaps the
most commendable thing I could do would be to
toss out half of the books that I own. .
Certainly I have a goodly number of .“good”
books, but I am afraid that they couldn't possibly
compensate for all the not—so-imaginative or selec-
tive she1f—sitters. After all, I have been the ASPCA
for homeless books for 10! these many years, and
I rarely refuse an addition to my collection. And
perhaps that is the reason that Wells’ Outline of
History, my baby book, and The Complete Poems
of Emily Dickinson sit side-by—side on the Tall
Shelf. And it is the reason that The Decameron,
Sandburg’s Abraham Lincoln, and The Baseball
Encyclopedia of 1955 share the same general lo-
cation on the lower Paperback Shelf... They all

_“The Man'Who Came, to Dinner,” still around.

Perhaps’ I should try to be a little more selec-

tive in which books I keep, and more than likely,

I. should throw away a number of the" books that
I have,‘ but I have a kind of historical attaéhinent
to almost every one. on the fiyleaf, there islﬁmy
name’, the date I acquired the book, an'd,,a1‘si$;" ariy
interesting facts that might he 'de1ate'd_ to the

scribed to the effect that I wrote a termpaper on

A -Louis Armstrong for Sophomore? .English. .A' ge-

ometry textbook has a note saying ‘that I wore
out a‘ new book in my attempt topass the course.
Vachel 'Lindsay’s Collected Poems was a rare.
birthday present—-—some.thing that I wanted. How
to Make $18,000 a Year Free-Lance Writing was
an’ encouraging Christmas present. f .'
Unfortunately not all of the books are in ter-

-ribly respectable condition, which I. imagine is a.

secondary requirement for an outstanding library.
[am afraid that if .a book-binder ever saw the sad
shape that some of my older ‘paperbacks and public

-library discards are" in,"’,'he would have‘ —a ﬁt of

apoplexy. But I can still" read them, andyas longas
I don’t lose any vital pages, I am content ‘to’ keep
them. ' l '  
Variety Enioyed I 

 And‘I do enjoy the variety that I havezj poetry,

‘short stories, novels, biography, history . and - mis-

cellaneousg I never have to get bored from lack of

.-,-choice’ -— I have something for almost every oc-

casion. There is variety, "too, in the ages of the
booksgdating from the 1867. set of Dickens to some
not-yet-published volumes of that wonderful young
poet, g. visser. V -

Perhaps I shouldn’t worry too much about the
quality and overabundance of my library because
as long —as there is Time, there is Hope. It is possi-
ble that within the twenty—ﬁve years that it looks
like it will take for me to become a senior, I can
eliminate all of the “fun,” uninspired, and,other-
wise bourgeois books from my library until I have
only “spinach” (good-for-you) books. Maybe then

I’ll be ‘eligible for the award. Otherwise, .I think,

Cogan Teaches Teachers

ny CHUCK Loon :
“Educators are those who
not only _teach ‘professionally

' but who devote a_ "substantial

amount of effort and talent to
the systematic improvement
of teaching,” according to Dr.

Morris L. Cogan, new chairman of
the departrrrent of teacher edu
cation.

“In the past universities have

 

‘_ had the sole job of educating the.
‘’ teacher.~This has not been with

out its drawbacks. Teaching tech-

" nology and methods have evolved

without being systematized or uni-

— ﬁed,” Dr. 7Co'gan Jexplained. “No’
' essential framework oroutline of

necessary teaching fundamentals
has been ._ adequately set up to

T guide‘ new teachers.

, H _,H_it or Miss _

“If the present educational sys-
tem 'is ‘ allowed to continue in
power with no competent diag-
nosticians available to analyze
methods and discern fundament-

als, there is a very good chance.

that the hit or miss improvement
in teaching techniques presently

employed will miss and not hit

becom§ static.” , -
Dr. Coga_n’s goal is “to set up
a systematic, ‘relationship be-

tween high schools and colleges

and educational development will

due to the vpresentlack of per-
sonnel qualified. to _ help the fu-

. ture teacher when, he must. ad-

from his ‘book-learning’ univer-
sity education.

“In order to make the transi-S I
- tion between the two as smooth as

possible there must’ ‘be an "ex-

-- treme degree of partnership be-
= tween the high school and the col-
; lege,” he noted. ‘ N

Toward Recognition
“If secondary school recognize
their responsibilities to the edu-
cation of teachers, within twenty

-years many new, specialized posi-

tions. for educators with a doc-
torate degree will exist 
schools,” he explained. “Teaching

‘clinics willbe operated, diagnos-

Cogan continued.

According to Dr. Cogan, .one

to help» the _student develop his
own style. “The diagnostician
would be trained tofknow when
to let go and when to pull back on

Technical Advancement
“With the increase in educa-
tional researchtaking place today
there are many technical advances

‘being added to teaching that can’t

be performed without special edu-
cation. Today it is absolutely nec-
essary that teachers know how to
unite and incorporate technologi-
cal advances with group and indi-
vidual instruction. .
“Once these skills are ac-
quired the curriculum in the
secondary schools must lend it-
self to the practice -or operation
of the skill. A

“A third improvement in "teach-
ing wouldpbe to instill a sense of
pride in educators. Such a profes-
sional identity is. needed in edu-
cation as inany other profession.”

In his department, Dr. Cogan
would like to see education placed
at a graduate level with some un-
dergraduate courses in education.
“No ‘undergraduate may take a
professional course until his jun-
ior year, while at Harvard no pro-
fessional courses are permitted
until the ﬁrst year of graduate
school. The latter is not a realistic
practice,” he concluded.

Cubs Meet Duke Frosh
Al Field House Saturday

The Cub basketball team will
contest the Duquesne University
frosh this Saturday at 6:15 p.m.
in the prelim to the Duqucsne—
Kentucky Wesleyan game which
begins at 8:30 p.m.

The Cubs lost their first game
of the season to Sll[)[)t‘l'_V Rock.
The yearlings will be without the
services of star Larry Szykowny
who is scholastically ineligible.

Panthers Seek
12th, 13th Victories

After a double overtime
win at vWest Point this past
Saturday, their ﬁfth victory

in a row, the Panther basket- 3'”

ballisquad will travel to play
Holy Cross and Dartmouth
Friday and Saturday nights.

Two victories this weekend
would-make the record 13-2, giv-
ing Coach Bob Timmons one more
win than he had all last season.

It would also give the Panthers

' an excellent chance of making the

NIT and possibly the NCAA tour-
naments.
Foley Missing

Holy Cross has four starting
players back from last season’s
team which compiled a 20-6 mark,
but they still lost more than one-
third of their offense when All-
American Jack Foley graduated.

The Crusaders of Coach Frank
Oftring have been called “the
smoothest ball club in the coun-
try,” by Boston College coach
Frank Power. Power also said,
“All they need is a good big
man to make them a great
team.”

The four returnees, 6-3 Pat Gal-
.lagher, Pete O'Connor, guard Joe
Kelly, and 6-3 Bob Foley, all av-
eraged under ten points a game
last season. Last Saturday they
defeated Dartmouth, 93-75.

Play Indians
Immediately after the game at
Worcester, the team will travel to
Hanover and play the Dartmouth
Indians. Coach Doggie Julian is
having his problems this season
and his squad is only 5-6, includ-
ing a 46-point loss to Kentucky.
Most of the scoring is done by
guard Steve. Spahn, who led the
Ivy League in scoring last sea-

This Friday Evening

By FRED

MARCUS

Bucknell shows its swimming team Friday at 8 p.m. at

expect, facing only Lafayette

‘Trees Hall. So far, the Bisons have given few hints of what to

and Gettysburg, neither con-

sidered a contender, and sporting a list of 14 sophomores

on the roster.

“They had a real good team last year,” said Panther co-

captain Jerry Sollinger, “but not

depth. We beat them on depth
then. Now. with 14 sophomores,
they possibly have that depth.
“We can't let up in any swim-
ming event. “And so there's going
to be no quarter in the meet,” he
added, referring to a determined
Panther effort to win the meet.
West Chester Victor
Bucknell was edged out by West
Chester in the Middle Atlantic
Collegiate Championships la st
year after swimming to a 9-2 re-
cord during the regular season.
Only one swimmer who placed in
the MAC Championships, co-cap-
tain and butterflyer Robin Harris,
swam in the Lafayette meet.

In the school paper The Buck-
nellian, Coach Bob Latour was
quoted as saying. “The morale
is high, and we should be, too,
and many times we should be
three deep in each event." He
also said at the same time that

 

many of the swimmers did not
have “the experience that can
be gained only through com-

petition.” .

Latour went on to say that he
felt this would be remedied after
two practice meets the Bisons
held earlier in the season.

Seek 4th Win

The Panthers will be trying for
their fourth straight victory, their
third win being a decision over
Penn last Saturday.

Penn scared us,”,said Solling-
er. “They won the medley relay.
We poured it on after that. They

It is the concensus of the team
that if they can top the Bisons
they can go on to an undefeated
season and possibly merit an in-

vitation to a post-season tourney.

Wrestlers, Host Army

In Last Home Match 

By BOB SLVIIZIK
Wrestling Coach Rex Peery will use the same lineup
against Army Saturday at 3 p.m. at the Field House that
brought his team a 16-11 wintover Maryland last Saturday,
as the wrestlers engage in their last home meet of the season.
Tom Baily, formerly the team’s ‘137-pounder, but now un-
able to keep his weight that low, challenged Frank O’Korn

at 147-pounds, in practice this
week but came out on the short
end of a 6-2 score. O’Korn thus
maintains the spot that he has
held all year.

Bill Solominsky also maintained
his new found spot in the starting
lineup at 137-pounds. Solominsky
battled Don Caslow to a 4-4 tie
inregulation time, then went on
to win in overtime, 1-0.

Starting Lineup

Thus the starting lineup will be
from 123 poundsto heavyweight,
respectively: Tom Heniff, Mike
Johnson, Solominsky, O’Korn,
John Carr, Jim Harrison, Lee
Hall, Ken Barr and Jeff Ware.

Army has one; of its poorer 3

teams‘ this year. Maryland
trounced the Cadets, 17-8. They
do, however, have some ﬁne_in-
dividual wrestlers and could
make it arough afternoon for
the Panthers. V
National Champion Mike Natvig
is the leading Army grappler.
Natvig is capable of wrestling

anywhere from 147-177 pounds."

Coach Leroy Alitz will ‘use Nat-

‘ vig to his best advantageand that

will probably be at 157—pounds
although there is a possibilityathat
Natvig may go all the way up to
177-pounds.
Nickla Stars A

Other Army standouts include
191-pounder Ray _Nickla, the
Eastern runner-up last year, 147-

‘pounder Ed Sharkness and 137-
Ed Winborn._ ‘Heavy-

Riﬂers Show ‘High Mark,

But Lose to Mountaineer

The riﬂe team posted its ‘sec-
ond highestcscore of the season

on Saturday yet they fell‘ before
West Virginia, 1433-1382.

The Mountaineers are a nation-
al powerhouse and perenially the
Greater Pittsburgh League’s cham-
pion. Top Panther scorers were:
George Dvorznak, 280; Mike Tier-
ney, 278; Buzz Carbone, 275; Mort
Glick, 275; and Randy. Ziegler,
274. . ' _

The team’s" record is now ad-

By IVIARVIN ZELKOVVITZ ‘

‘Twelve intramural basketball teams have met their ﬁrst
test in the opening rounds of the intramural basketball
tournament at the Stadium Gym.

John ‘Spehar, Delta Iota Delta was unable to overcome a 38-35
halftime deﬁcit, as they lost to the Dukes, 78-65. The Dukes

had two high scorers, as Sid Fe-i1el¢

scored 24 points, and Bernie Stein,
22.

Tom Krugh dominated play in
the game, between the Ricochets
and the-No-Names, as he scored
22 of his team’s 39 points. He was
only three short of the No-Names’
total of 25 points.

Sigma Phi Epsilon eeked out a
55-51 victory over Sigma Alpha
Epsilon on the strength of Gene

,Balkovec’s 14 point second half.
Sigma Phi was ahead by ‘only

three at the half, and needed Bal-

'kovec’s effort to maintain its lead.

Phi ,Gamma' Delta defeated
Delta Tau Delta, 47-41, in other

 

fraternity action. Bill iBaloh~
sparked the Phi, Gam attack
with 19 points.
