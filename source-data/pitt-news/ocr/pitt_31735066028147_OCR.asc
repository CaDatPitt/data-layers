Zachariah Blott

News Edltor

Three days after police clashed
with a group of more than 1,000 teens
outside a popular Oakland nightclub,
the club owner, the officers and the
youths involved each are blaming
each other for causing the so-called
riot on Forbes Avenue that night.

Police began bossing people
away from the area, after the group try-
ing to get into Laga — an under-21
dance club —— grew so large that traﬁic
could not pass on Forbes Avenue.

The youths began stumbling over

, each other as police forced them away,

according to eyewitnesses. Some
ﬁghts ensued among the angry crowd
as it dissipated down the sidestreets of

= Oakland, causing some nearby taverns
Eemﬁmgy‘ and businesses to look their patrons
mﬁggha inside to prevent the mob from
ﬁmdaman swelling as police orderal individuals

5?

But some accuse the officers of
oveneacting to the situation, saying

the 30 ofﬁcers used intimidation
instead of reason because the youths
were black

Now almost every group
involved has a different version of the
incident, and remarks about the race of
the youths made by a cormnander
from the Zone 6 police department
have angered a leader in Pitt's black
community.

The problems began Sunday
night when many high school—aged
teens from throughout the city showed
up at Club Laga for a Back—to—School
hip—hop party, according to club owner
Ron Levick

He said the party was hosted by
three men "around 20 years old" who
frequent the club, and rented the hall
from him for the evening. Levick said
he and his wife thought it was going to
be a private party for friends of the
three men.

But by 10:30 p.m., a crowd of
over 1,000 teens, most of whom were
black, were lined up along Forbes
Avenue, waiting to join the 237
already inside.

Because so many people were

Schenley Quad was
alive with the sound of clat-
tering carts and the cries of
university students this
weekend as new and return-
ing collegians moved into

the dorms in preparation for

the fall term.

For many upperc1ass-
men, the annual move is
routine. But for the more
than 3,000 freshmen set-
tling into rooms across
campus, excitement, ques-
tions and confusion reigned
supreme.

With elevators and hall-
ways cramped and crowded

‘”"”“'“r~=v"v'*rv— vr-w-.~,-.-um..a;.r-..................._......__._._, ,,

campus-wide, many stu-
dents experienced tie—ups
throughout the weekend.
Most of them waited in
lines for elevators, IDs,
books and the all-important
financial aid.

"The traffic was bad, it
was nonstop traffic," said
freshman Lauren
Mclaughlin, as she returned
from standing in the finan-

cial aid line for a little"

under an hour.

"It was crazy," said
Indiana resident Ed
Shestak, a freshman who
moved into the Towers
Thursday afternoon. He
imagined that cars would be
backed up farther than they

were when he arrived in
Oakland, but added that the
real "traffic" was inside the
dorm.

Lines for the yellow
moving carts in the Towers
lobby were 40 to 50 feet
long. Outside of
McCormick Hall, large
crowds of students and
their parents anxiously
awaited the next available
cart.

These lines, coupled
with the droves of people
surrounding elevator doors
and filling hallways, result-
ed in lengthy backups.

move my stuff up to the

The sisters of Chi Omega take a moment away from greeting freshmen.

Freshman Activity Fair huge;
Smaller events pepper clay

Hal Turner
Staff Writer

Pitt continued introducing itself to its
new academic community Tuesday with a
series of events. These events were geared
towards better orienting both faculty and
students with what the University has to
offer.

The new faculty and teaching assis-
tants completed their orientation process
with the Information Fair, organized by
The Center for Instructional Development
and Distance Education.

The ground ﬂoor of Forbes Quad was
ﬁlled from 11:30 to 1:30 p.m. with
brochure-laden tables and folks willing to
answer any questions incoming teachers
had regarding departments, beneﬁts, and
services.

Andreas Zamora, a visiting assistant
professor in the department of Hispanic
Languages, attended the fair because he's
from out of town and wanted to learn about
the bus system. The fair also oifered him
the chance to touch base with people he'd
be meeting later in the week about his job
beneﬁts.

Later Tuesday afternoon, the Greeks
hosted the Watermelon Picnic to introduce
freshmen to the rush process and to begin
getting to know some of their prospective
members.

Nora O'Neill, a sister in Delta Delta
Delta, explained her sorority's take on the
picnic's purpose.

"We want to make sure they know it's
not just about parties," she said. "You get to
meet a lot of people; it's a broad spectrum

of people."
Pitt's fraternities and sororities spent

the afternoon mingling with interested stu-
dents, explaining their organizations and
introducing themselves.

According to Jessica Hartman, Vice
President of the Panhellenic Association,
the national goveming body of sororities,
the Watermelon Picnic is the first in a long
line of exciting rush events.

"Our next really big event is the Fall
Bash on September 20. We got 105.9 FM
to come and sponsor it," she said.

For more information on sororities or
fraternities, students can call the
Panhellenic Association/Interfratemity
Council wiﬂr questions at 648-7825.

The Watermelon Picnic wasn't the
only event on the agenda Tuesday to intro-
duce students to different campus organi-
zations. There was also the Freshman
Activity Fair.

This year, the fair was bigger than
ever. The ground ﬂoor of Forbes Quad, as
well as the overpass connecting the Towers
patio and David Lawrence Hall were
jammed with organizations and interested
students.

Thousands of students at the fair shuf-
ﬂed among tables, gathering information
on organizations.

Multitudes of interests ranging from
science to religion and boxing to friendship
were represented by campus groups.

When asked about this years fresh-
man class, Stephen Jones of Some of God's
Children said it showed promise.

"Look at the list (of interested stu-
dents), it's pretty good," he said.
"Everybody's nice, everybody's smiling."

All the religious groups were located

room," Shestak said.

The inﬂux of cars during peak
move-in times, compounded by the
increased pedestrian traffic, forced
campus police and Pitt volunteers
to find ways of safely directing
crowds to destinations around the
quad area.

Police were placed in front of
Sutherland Hall, at the entrance to
Schenley Quad and at both ends of

Bigelow Blvd. to help direct traffic."

"The object is to satisfy all par-
ties — the students, the businesses
and the people living in the area,"
said Pitt Campus Police Captain
Tim Delaney. "What we try to do is

ble for all concerned. If someone

‘drives several hundred miles they

don't want to hear, ‘Make a right."'

Cars with incoming students
were directed by campus police to
park in Schenley Quad and the
Soldiers and Sailors Parking
Garage.

Bigelow Boulevard was tem-
porarily closed during rush hours
on Thursday and Friday and for
most of the day on Saturday and
Sunday to provide additional park-
mg.
"Everybody is happy with [the
Bigelow closing]," Delaney said.
"It is the best thing that we could do
other than moving buildings."

But while traffic, auto and oth-
erwise, was ever present, freshmen
had other concerns running through
their heads.

"You're used to having your par-
ents take care of everything, and
now it's like I've got to do it
myself," said Mclaughlin.

Freedom and responsibilities
weighed heavy on the minds of
many of the freshmen used to hav-
ing the ordinary, everyday things
done by parents.

"I've got all this freedom, but I
still think that I'm on a week—or—two
camping trip," freshman Tim Grech
said. "It hasn't hit yet that I'm not
going to see my family for a couple
of months."

"My mother came to drop off
some stuff theother day and I think
it was because she really wanted to
see me," he continued.

Freshman students had the usual
separation anxieties and pressures
of finding friends and orienting
themselves with Pitt's sprawling

V campus.

"It was hard for me to leave my
family and friends, but now that I'm
here and doing things, I'm not
majorly homesick," said Maureen
Nelson.

Other freshmen had a bit of a
different experience.

"I don't think my mother wanted
to let go," chuckled freshman Jason
Radion. "I called them last night
and my mother practically ran to
the phone to see how I was doing.
But I don't feel like I'm letting go,
just that I'm moving on."

Moving on is exactly what most
new students hope to do while at
Pitt.

"When I got here, I realized that
there is no turning back now, and so
I hope for the best," said freshman
Joe Kubiak. "My goal has become
to survive the first year and see if I
like college life." '

trying to get ir1to the club — which only
holds around 500 people — police anived
with dogs to block off the street and usher
the individuals away.

But when the oﬁcers arrived, some
crowd members claim the police olfered no
explanation and began ordering the teens
away, according to Aisha Anderson, presi-
dent of Pitt's Black Action Society.
Anderson said she has discussed the inci-
dent with about ﬁve black Pitt freshmen
who were waiting to get into the party.
Andersonwas not present during the inci-
dent.

The teens told her that city and campus
police began shoving individuals away from
the door and ordering them to leave, without
trying to explain that the street needed
cleared or that the club was too small for the

THE PITT NEWS

immense crowd. Pitt Police officials said
they were only assisting Zone 6 officers and
were not in charge of the operation.

The teens told Anderson that crowd
members fell into each other like dominoes
when police forced them back, causing con-
fusion as to who was pushing whom.

She said the confusion quickly turned
into chaos and kids were ﬁghting, cops were
yelling at them to leave and pushing some
teens against storefronts.

She said the students who approached
her claim that police also used their dogs to
chase people away from the area.
Commander Edward Kelly of the Zone 6
police department denied that that occurred,
and also denied that the oﬂicers touched any
of the individuals.

Anderson said police would not have
reacted that way if the teens were white
instead of black.

"The assumption is that if a group of
black people are together, a riot will break
out," she said. "[Ihe police] acted in haste. If
it were white kids, they would have been
told what was going on and left to go home
leisurely."

Kelly, who is white, said he did‘ not
know if the oﬂicers would have reacted dif-
ferently had the crowd been white.

He said the olﬁcers did not intimidate
the crowd and denies rumors that they
pushed some youths against store windows
and let their dogs chase people down the
street.

He added that the crowd was hostile
before police arrived.

"There were kids spilling into the
streets and ﬁghting inside and outside the
club,'' he said. "We were trying to contain
it."

He said teens waiting to get into the

club began pushing each other to get in
before police arrived, "resulting in ﬁghts
between rival gangs."

Kelly admitted that the police were
stern, but defended their actions because of
the gang factor and because the crowd was
already hostile and "out of control." If race
inﬂuenced the officers’ actions, he said it
was because black youths are more likely to
join gangs, and gangs are more likely to turn
violent.

Kelly said the officers stopped the party
and sent everyone away to keep the mob of
teens from overﬂowing into side streets and
starting more ﬁghts.

The police took appropriate action in
ordering the kids to leave and never physi-
cally interacted with them, he said.

The club owner, Levick, admitted that
many of the 1,000 or so teens outside his
club were on Forbes Avenue causing a traf-
ﬁc problem. He said police ordered him to
shut down the party because of the large
crowd.

Levick said police escorted some of the
people out of Laga and that the individuals
were angry because the officers did not
explain why they were being forced out. He
said those teens started pushing and shoving
each other, but he saw no serious ﬁghts
inside or outside the club.

Levick said racial tensions may have
been responsible for the problems, but
added that the incident has been blown out
of proportion.

"I'm hoping people understand what
happened," he said. "Whenever 1,500 black
people get together, people freak out. It was-
n't a real situation."

Andersonagreedthatiftheteenswerei

white, they wouldn't have been rushed out
of the area so forcibly and said that the
police acted irresponsibly. .

"Cops were scared of what the kids
would do to Oakland, not what the situation
would do to the kids," she said "These kids
could have been h ."

Anderson said that when a group of
black teens assemble, cops are quick to
assume something violent is about to hap-
pen. But she said Kelly's remark that blacks
are more likely to join gangs was "ridicu-
1ous."

Not all of the 30 police officers dealing
with the crowd were white, though.
Detective Michael Blake is a black police
oﬂicer who was on the scene Sunday. he
also indicated that gangs were present. '

"There were rival [gangs] coming from
all over to this party," he said. "You're bound
to have trouble."

Blake said that police react to how a
crowd acts "and this crowd was very hos-
tile."

Though versions of what happened
Sunday night differ, the results are the same:
the youths were ordered to go home at 11
p.m., two minors were arrested on disorder-
ly conduct charges, and minimal injuries
and damages were reported.

Levick fears the incident will make
some afraid of patronizing his club.

"We've never had anything like this
happen before and I hope it doesn't atfect
our business in the future," he said.

UNION

Pitt officials said that in April,
they offered union members an
increase of 2 percent with a possi-
ble bonus of 1 percent, but that con-
tract was overwhelmingly rejected
by the union.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service
said the 2 percent was a cost-of-liv-
ing wage increase and that the 1-
percent bonus would have been
reserved for workers who excelled
in their position.

The workers, who maintain all
of Pitt’s facilities and grounds, say
they want an unconditional 3—per-
cent increase.

Scott Harley, a Pitt incinerator
operator who took part in the
march, said the April contract was

also rejected because it would have
removed the workers’ rights to col-
lective bargaining.

"They want to break the power
of the union," said Harley while the
crowd swarmed around the
Cathedral of Learning outside
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s
office.

All around him, over 100 fellow
union members chanted, "PEOPLE
UNITED WILL NEVER BE
DEFEATED!"

Union President Billy Jordan
said Pitt's offer also would have
stripped Local 29 members of their
seniority rights. That means outside
bidders could have bid for their jobs
and have an equal chance of getting

them when the
expired.

The march began in front of the
Cathedral and snaked around all of
its sidewalks and paths. Before
moving on to demonstrate around
the student union and the Freshman

COIltI'3.ClZ IICXI

Activity Fair, the procession
stopped at the window of
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg's

office while he went about his busi-
ness.

"What time is it?" shouted
Ricky Ellison, the worker leading
the chants.

"UNION TIME!" they replied.

"What do we want?" Ellison
continued.

"CONTRACTS!"

"NOW!!!

Union member Marianne
Morisson said, "We need a contract
now. Pitt's being unfair. We're
worth a whole lot more than they're
paying us."

The chanting workers handed
out flyers that took issue with a new
scoreboard Pitt will install in its
stadium, saying that if the
University! can afford such an
expense, then Pitt should be able to
satisfy the wants of the workers.

With a raised fist and a raised
voice, Jordan summed up the plight
of his and other unions.

"America needs to wake up to
the exploitation and of its workers!”
he cried. “The exploitation and
oppression of workers must stop!"

in the overpass. While some expressed con-
cern that the organizations would resort to
competing for students‘ attention, most
viewed their close proximity in a positive
light.

"We were more ooncemed that we were
moved from Forbes Quadto the overpass,
but it's worked out better, actually. We're get-
ting a lot of traffic," said Father David
Abernathy of the Roman Catholic Newman
Center.

_ B.J. and Katrina Woodworth, a married
couple from the Cornerstone Christian
Fellowship, felt that although there was a lot
of traﬁic through the overpass, some stu-
dents might have been intimidated by such a
large group of religious organizations.

"We feel like people are rtmning
through here, like they're a little tentative,"
Katrina said.

B.J. found it interesting that the reli-
gious groups were the only ones that seemed
to be clustered.

Many students, although ﬁnding lots of
interesting information, thought some
groups at the fair were a little intrusive once
they got there.

"Some people were annoying, like the
ones with particular views," said freshman
Erika Stark. "If I have your view, I'll come
over, but don't get in my face."

Most students were pleased with the
fair.

"Free food, free T—shirts, there you go,"

‘ said sophomore Danielle Ennico. "What
else could you ask for?"

Police could have
handled Laga mob better

The mob outside of Laga last Sunday night was not
posing an immediate threat, and the police overreacted.
Kids fought with each other, and the mob approached a
near-riot level. The owner of ‘Laga is now worried that
his business might be in trouble because of this incident
and the rumors that circulated. And the worst part is,
this all could have been avoided, but wasn’t, because
police didn’t take their time when they should have.-

The police should have taken the time to reason
with the mob, to get out megaphones and tell every-
body what was going on. Instead, police came in and
tried to push everybody out through intimidation. That
was foolish. Thirty police ofﬁcers are not enough to
contain 1,000 people, even teenagers, if things get out
of hand, as they did once the pushing started.

Police told the mob to move, but in a crowd that
size, only the people nearest the cops — the ones who

could‘ hear them — were moving fast. The crowd com— ,

pressed, and people were trampled. The physical clash

of bodies resulted in ﬁghts when kids tried to protect '

themselves.

All the police had to do was to grab loudspeakers
and tell the crowd: “The club is closing. You all have to
leave.” *

Teenagers may not be the most reasonable people,
especially in large numbers, but they’re going to
respond to reason a lot better than they did to being

~ shoved, because they didn’t know what was going on.

On the other side of this, Laga’s manager did not
take the time he should have to oversee the event at his

establishment. He rented the place to three people.

whom he said he thinks, but is not sure, are college stu-
dents. Knowing who they were and what they were
planning (not a private party, as he said he was led to
believe) might have led him to take his own precau-
tions against trouble, like closing the doors when the
building approached capacity, or telling the.renters that
they had to sell tickets in advance.

Laga is not a concert venue that can handle adrr1is—
sion at the door. Forbes Avenue is not ready for that,

_ an‘cl_appare_r1_t_1y,\ir’1_either are the Zone 6 police.

Welcome back — to motel Pitt

Marc Nuzzo
Columnist

Ah, the end of August
again. A time for some students
to hit the books, others the bars
and even a few to hit the new
roommates whom they have
discovered they really don’t
have that much in common
with.

But whether you’re major-
ing in quantum physics or Jose
Quervo consumption, coming
back to school usually entails a
move. And whether you’re a
‘freshman or a ﬁfth-year senior,
chances are you’ve lived in
Pitt’s dorms — or, as the
University caHs them, residence
halls. In light of the political-
correctness-bashing trend in our
nation today, I’ll spare you the
lecture, but I will remind you
that septic-tank cleaners are
now commonly called refuse-
treatinent technicians. ,

The administration received
the equivalent of an overdue
tuition bill in its mailbox when
it was discovered earlier this
month that it couldn’t get away
with packing students into
dorms without a permit from the
city. While it took a couple of
phone calls from the Cathedral
to the city planning ofﬁce to get
the permit, some students can
now rest easy in their sink/beds
knowing that the school is legal-
ly getting away with housing
them in a six-square-foot cubi-
cle next to some guy named
Tony from Long Island.

As if forced moving -—

THE PITT NEWS

Don’t waste your tuition; make the most of this school

Gamal Dillard
columnist

I am going to get right to the point
since I have to go play basketball. Take
advantage of the next four to ﬁve years.
I know you have your ﬁrst taste of free-
dom and that all you want to do is attend
every party and stay out all night. You
can do that, but just make sure you take
care of your academic priorities. I will
concede that everything I tell you I
probably have not adhered to all of the
time, but if you take some of my advice,
you will do well at this university and in
life.

Go to class! Last fall I went to most
of my classes and got over a 3.0. As long
as you go to class, you have an idea of
what’s going on. You will know what
will be on the test and you, unlike me in
the past, won’t spend 12 hours review-
ing the wrong material before the quiz

or test. On the first day of class, go talk’

to your professors. Shake their hands
and tell them about yourself. You will be
pleasantly surprised that these people
with several degrees may be a lot like
you.eMake it a habit to speak to them on
a regular basis, even if it is just a hello
and goodbye. If you want, stop by their
ofﬁces and sit and talk to them. Many

students are afraid to do this.

Instead of spending so much money
on books, ask your professors if they
have extra copies from the publisher.
You will be surprised how many copies
of books professors have sitting on their
shelves. Many times a professor will put
books on reserve at the library. Why
spend $15 on a book that is only 20
pages long?

-Get into study groups. You will be
surprised how much easier the class
becomes when you can share notes and
discuss what is going on in class with
others. Don’t be afraid to go to someone
and ask to meet him at the library. Every
class has some wise guy who knows it
all and lets everyone know that he is a
genius. Ask that person after class to be
your study buddy. Who knows? Maybe
that person doesn’t have many friends
and will gladly do your homework for
you!

Go to the computer labs before it’s
too late. Pitt has an even larger incoming
class this year, and the labs will be inun-
dated by procrastinators. Save your
work every couple of paragraphs. There
is no worse feeling than losing a paper
the hour before it is due! If you don’t
have a disk, save it on someone else’s;
or tell the lab operator you lost your

disk, and when he pulls out a bunch of
lost disks, point to one and say, “That’s
mine!” And don’t change the fonts of
your paper until you save your paper.
Many students have been heard cursing
the computer after trying this.

Be considerate of others. If the labs
are full, don’t sit there sending e-mail to
your friends while others wait for a
computer.

If you have a problem with your
disk or have questions concerning the
computer, don’t be afraid to ask the lab
operator for help. Most of them are lazy
and will try to give you directions while
sitting down and surfing the web.‘
Demand that they get up and help you.
Your best bet is to go to the lab where
Randy works (I hope he is still here). He
is the best lab operator!

Most importantly, make friends.
Your friends can be anyone. Don’t be
afraid to go out of your clique and meet
different people. The guy with 12 ear-
rings and no hair might just be the nicest
guy you ever met. Or the girl who rolls
her eyes at everybody might need some-
one to listen to her. If you come from the
inner city of Philadelphia or come from
the suburbs of New Jersey, meet differ-
ent friends. I have been at this school for
several years, and the most important

lessons I have learned didn’t come from
a book!! To all you freshmen, don’t,be
nervous. Within time, you will learn
where all the buildings are, and you will
probably take four trips around‘ the
Cathedral just to ﬁnd one classroom.
Have fun! Relax. You are in your prime.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions.
After all, this university is here to serve
you. Treat the University as a $30,000
investment. In some cases it may be
more or less. If you invested $30,000 in
the stock market, you wouldn’t have a
cavalier attitude about your money,
would you? Just because many of you
may be on student loans doesn’t mean
that money goes into a vacuum. That
money has to be paid back starting
shortly after you graduate.

It is important to make connections
now. Find a job that will look good on a
resume. Nowadays, prospective
employers look to see what you did in
college and not just after. You don’t
have to have a 4.0 average. Just be a
productive person in college. Good luck
to everyone, and remember, you CAN
do anything to which you put your
mind, so put your mind to it!!

Gamal Dillard is a columnist for The
Pitt News.

Conservative valuessuport equality, not liberalism

This university is out of
control. I’m tired of the lies, lib-
eralism and double standards.
It’s time we ﬁght back! If the
‘60s were a time of revolt
against an old, outdated,
staunch, stuffy establishment,
then now we are revolting
against the outdated, hippie-
induced love-in and faux toler-
ance of today. .,

What do I mean? Look

0 around you. We are supposed to '

be one student body, one nation,
under God. We were taught to
look beyond color, race and
creed. Do we? No. Why?
Because the system propagates
the idea that we shouldn’t. Sure,
I’m proud to say I’m Irish and
Polish and I eat potatoes and
pierogies and drink beer and
vodka. Hell, I love Guinness,
wear shirts that say “Ireland
Unfree Will Never Be at
Peace,” know a bunch of rebel
songs, and can sing in Polish,
but first and foremost I am an
American, not an Irish
American or Polish American. I
don’t get money because of my
race, color or religion (I’m a

n.-._..—=—.._............‘.~..-..- _,..—.... u. .. ,. .... 1...... .-_ rm... .. ‘M... ........m..... ....v....\- - . ---—-m»--...-- ..- -....-

Roman Catholic). I don’t even
bitch about the fact that the Irish
have always been the most
oppressed people in the world
(after the Jews) or that a part of
my (Polish) family was burned
in Auschwitz.

I have a female friend who
is very smart, goes to CMU,
studies computer science, has a
4.0, and Intel pays for every-
thing. However, she is mad
because she doesn’t know if she
was hired because she is good
or because Intel had to ﬁll a
quota. Is this right? Sure, she
gets an advantage because of
affirmative action, but she feels
like she is just there to make
Intel and America happy that
women are in the work force
and that someone has done
something about this.

I’m sure I’ve pissed people
off by saying we should earn
our wages and not have it hand-
ed to us by the Man. However, I
have a question for you: Does
welfare provide an incentive for
getting a job, or does it keep
people on welfare? I’m willing
to bet it keeps people on.

But how can a mother of
three work when she has no one
to watch her kids and the gov-
ernment helps her out anyway?
In fact, she is rewarded with
extra money for having those
kids. Why would she even try to
get off of the system?

Unfortunately, and this is
the part no one wants to hear,
society today is too intent on
pleasing everyone, and we for-
get that there are such things as
morals.

This country was built on
Judeo-Christian ethics, like it or
not, with which Muslims agree
(for the most part) as well. But
by saying that if you wait until
you’re manied, have a stable
ﬁnancial status, and can provide
what is necessary to have and
support children, everyone
starts complaining about their
right to do something. Se1f-con-
trol has become taboo, because
someone is always there to ﬁx
it. Get pregnant, get an abortion.
Get lazy, get on welfare. (I’m
not really against unemploy-
ment, because the difference is

_ that, eventually, you get off it.)

o.....-.. u..

But we were born into the
welfare state. We can ’t get off it.
Bullshit. I’ve seen kids who
grew up in the “projects” ﬁnish
high school and either get jobs
(good ones at that), enter the
military or go to college. It’s
time we fought these outdated
notions that no one can do it on
his own. Sure, we can help, but
there comes a time when we
have to say “no.” It’s like tough
love for alcoholics.

If we truly are one people,
then we should be one people.
There shouldn’t be a box to
check that says Caucasian,
African American, Hispanic,
Asian or Other. There was never
a box that said Irish, Polish,
English, Slovak, French or
Other. Why? Because everyone
ﬁgures that if you share a skin
color, you share everything. No.
There is more ﬁghting between
people of different ideologies
than people of different colors.

Minorities shouldn’t exist
as a term for people. When you
say you are a citizen, that’s what
you are: a citizen. Of course, we
should love and cherish our

backgrounds and use what we
get from them to better our soci-
ety, but they shouldn’t be a case
of whose ancestors are better. If
you don’t like the fact that the
people of this country are one,
homogenous people, under
God, indivisible, enjoying free-
dom, go back. (Actually, many
an Irishman made his fortune
here, then ﬂoated back to the
Emerald Isle to live la dulce
vita.) .

And so it is with this uni-
versity. Look at the word —
University. It comes from Latin,
and it means, pretty much, a
society or the whole.

Unity.

But this is not the case.
Race and gender are made out
to be students’ most deﬁning
factors. We have all been con-
vinced that women and minori-
ties can’t do shit without the
help of the white, heterosexual
male. Why do we believe this?
Of course no one has said it ——
that would be wrong — but
every policy this place has is
rooted in this idea.

Wlsnosky, page 12

I2

WISNOSKY

It’s bullshit. All of it. The liberals
have been screaming for equality for so
long that they’ve created inequality. We
are equal. Pull away the strings of these
“equality”-making policies and look.
Proposition 209 in California has ended
affirmative action, and there are few
problems. If the Left tells us to look
past race, why won’t they? Because
they can’t. It’s words without action: “If
we say it, then it’s true.” How?

Conservatives are the ones who

. truly espouse equality and liberty for all

that they are. Kill the big government,

peaceably and decide that the
Constitution sucks, then rewrite it. It’s
our right. We are supposed to be free.
We are supposed to be able to work and
get paid fairly. We’re not supposed to
get taxed on our income. We’re not sup-
posed to depend on the government for
survival; it’s supposed to depend on us.

So I say, let’s forget the boxes; hell,
let’s all mark “Other.” Let’s not hire a

a woman or “minority” because she is
the best, because she can do the job.
Let’s not see colors anymore, or gender.

tors have been mulling matters in the
secret room in the Cathedral of Learning
called “the war room” where they make
important decisions to ‘do things like
starting school on Wednesday each year.

FROM PAGE 11

Here, the brainchild of the SLUM ,

(Start Liking University Management)
movement began. A grass-roots cam-
paign to quell opposition to University
decisions, SLUM began when several
administrators returned from sabbatical
in China.

In its purest form, SLUM will work
a lot like the IRS, only more slowly and
less efﬁciently. (That comment probably
just earned me an audit next year, but I
like the IRS... no, honestly!) The nice
thing about SLUM is that it already
exists, except it doesn’t have its own
expense account or catering, which
members are looking forward to.

A typical meeting of the soon—to—be
SLUM committee would run a little
something like this:

-Administrator #1: All right, it’s set-
tled. We’ll start school on Wednesday
and make everybody come back to
school half a week early.
-Administrator #2: Great. Now, what
about the fact that we admitted 20 per-
cent more students than we can possibly
house on campus?

-Administrator #3: We’ll take couches
and desks out of the dorms and put in
cots and space maximizers from IKEA.
-Administrator #2: We can do that‘?
-Administrator #1: Yep, We’re SLUM.
-Administrator #2: Cool. Can you pass
those petit fours and the cappuccino?
That was a hard day!

Well, the short and cramped of the
whole matter is: Welcome back to Motel

  Tacos will be a

quick meal for
Panthers

I guess the odds makers in Vegas
know what they’re doing after all.
They’re making our very own Pitt
Panthers seven—point favorites in
Saturday’s opening game against the
Southwestern Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns.

You see, when attempting to make
football predictions, most people sub-
merge themselves in yardage and touch-
down statistics, home versus away
records, success on artiﬁcial versus nat-
ural turf, and all that kind of stuff. But I
have a theory on how those Vegas studs
make their picks. I’ll bet they only have
to look at one thing — they know that
the team nickname is the single greatest
determining factor in football.

Here’s how the whole thing works.
Those odds makers just compare the
two teams’ mascots, and whichever one
would win in a real ﬁght will win the
game. They’re almost always right, too.

The team nickname is supposed to
be a reﬂection of the attitude and per-
_forrnance of the team. When you picture
a classic, blood-and-guts kind of foot-
ball team, you picture teams like the
Bears or the Giants. If you picture these
teams playing each other, you can envi-
sion a hulking Goliath of a giant
wrestling a ferocious grizzly bear to the
bloody death.

When I picture a Panther, I picture a
ﬁerce, snarling beast.

But what the hell is a Ragin’ Cajun?

The only thing that comes to mind
for me is a stack of Cajun fajitas, or
something like that. While this kind of
food could give you a mean case of gas,
it certainly isn’t very intimidating.

Let’s try picturing this battle like we
did with the Bears and the Giants. What
I see is a penned up, pissed-off Panther
in one corner and a stack of sizzling hot
chicken fajitas sitting neatly on a plate
in the other.

As soon as the whistle sounds to
start the battle, the Panther would leap
on the fajitas and devour them in a mat-
ter of seconds with the ﬂour tortilla-
wrapped spicy food putting up almost
no ﬁght.

So, as logic would have it, this is
exactly what will happen on Saturday
when the two teams square off in Pitt
Stadium. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m
not a total idiot. The Pitt players are not
going to actually eat those other guys,

Piombino
leads men’s
soccer

John Abernathy & Brian Knavish

The Pitt News

With a good mix of young talent
and experienced veterans, Pitt’s
men’s soccer team is primed and
ready to put together an-outstanding
1997 season.

“I like the team we have,” Head
Coach Joe Luxbacher said.
“Hopefully, we’ll see some success.”

The Panthers hope to improve on
last season’s 8-7-2 record and 9th
place finish in the conference. Such a
finish would be quite an accomplish-
ment in a highly competitive Big
East.

The conference is widely regard-
ed as the toughest men’s soccer con-
ference in the entire nation. The

team is fellow Big East rival St.
John’s, and another Big East foe,
Rutgers, is ranked 7th. Several other
Big East schools can be found
throughout the top 25.

“The Big East is the top league in
the country,” Luxbacher said. “We
want to be able to compete with the
teams at this level.”

“You need leaders on the field,
and Jason provides that leadership,”
Luxbacher said.

Piombino was quick to point out
that although he is the lone captain,
other players will step up and be lead-
ers. Junior forward Drew Kopp,

Women to face tough first year in Big East

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer

The University of
Pittsburgh’s women’s
soccer team hopes to
improve on its inaugural
1996 season this fall.

Pitt finished last year
with only two wins and
expects to do much bet-
ter.

“Last year was a
learning year for most of
our players,” said Head
Coach Roland Sturk.

No one on last year’s
team had any Division I
experience. Now, with
one year under its belt,
the team hopes to
improve on the two-win
season. The veterans, if
one can call them that,
hope to lead the Panthers
to respectability in their
first year of participation
in the Big East
Conference.

They are not really
veterans, for they only

ALAlAAAALll~AAAAAlb.\.|-

have one year of experi-
ence. Most are only
sophomores this year.
The team does have a
fewsupperclassmen, but
not enough to really
challenge established
conference opponents.

Not only did last
year’s team have little
experience, but it also
had problems that started
from day one. Pitt’s
starting goaltender, Ilene
Ravich, did not play any
games last year because
of an injury.

Leading scorer Mia
Mora was lost to a knee
injury halfway into the
season. This made it very
tough for the team to get
any continuity going.

Both of these injuries
should be healed by now.
These two players should
be ready to go as soon as
the season begins on
Aug. 30 at Duquesne.

This year also brings
new challenges for this

team. It moves into the
Big East and will be
playing some very diffi-
cult games. .

The Summer of Love? The Summer
of George (Seinfeld watchers, you under-
stand)? No. The Summer of Trecia
Smith. '

The multi-talented track star leaped,
ran and threw her way to national cham-
pionships, accolades and recognition, all
in less than two months, blocking out the
rest of the school’s athletic happenings
(even the new colors) as the top story of
Pitt’s sports summer.

At the Big East Championships,
Smith won the long jump, triple jump and
shot put and was named the meet’s
Women’s Outstanding Performer. At the

Trecia’s records, Willard's scare highlight the off-season

‘ 7-year-old triple jump record of 46-8,
won the high jump and the long jump and
walked away with the title of Division I
Athlete of the Year, as selected by the
U.S. Track and Field Coaches
Association.

“Trecia has had the best season of
any female athlete in the country,” said
Head Coach Steve Lewis. “There isn’t
much she didn’t accomplish this sum-
mer.”

Besides setting a new record at the
ECACs, Smith singlehandedly garnered
28 team points, winning the high jump
with a height of 5-11.25 and the long
jump with a leap of 22-0.75 and placing
third in the shot put with a throw of 46-
8.25.

A pulled hamstring at the NCAA
Championships put
Smith on the shelf,
but not before she
took the national
championship in the
long jump with a dis-
tance of 21-10.

“I didn’t expect
to accomplish this
much,” Smith said
after the season. “But
I expected to improve
and I’m very happy
with the results.”

But that’s not
all you missed while

fourth, and at the ECAC Championships,
where they ran to a second place ﬁnish
behind host George Mason University.

Basketball 8

It was a busy May for the basketball
team. Head Coach Ralph Willard
armounced he will stay put at Pitt, putting
to rest any speculation that he will‘ follow
Rick Pitino to Boston. Discussions
regarding a possible contract extension
began right after Willard’s announce-
ment. There are four years remaining on
his current contract.

Following intense speculation of
whether or not he’d go in the first round,
Pitt forward Mark Blount announced his
plans to forgo his final two years of col-
lege and enter the NBA draft. Blount
went to the Seattle Supersonics in the
second round, drafted 55th overall.

Also in hoops
news, sophomore
Isaac Hawkins
announced that he
would return to the
basketball team.
Hawkins sat out two
games earlier in the
season after watching
his playing time
dwindle and
announced his depar-
ture in April, but
retracted his deci-
sion.

the Providence Friars to end the regular

Pitt from the Big East Tournament. The
Panthers finished 8-17 in Big East play
and 19-26 overall.

Wrestling _

Two Pitt Wrestlers spent a week in
Greece, wrestling against international
competition. Mark Bodo and John
Withrow, who both placed at the NCAA
Championships, received the opportunity
to wrestle in the
“ M a c e d o n i a

senior defender Greg Hoolihan and
redshirt sophomore sweeper Travis
Kruse are just a few such Panthers who
should have big years.

This veteran leadership will be
especially important this season con-
sidering that the team lost eight
seniors, six of whom were starters.

One position where the coaches
are looking for someone to step up and
fill a hole is goalkeeper. The gradua-
tion of stellar goalie Adam Spitzer

leaves three inexperienced candidates

and freshman Mike Norris —— compet-
ing for the job. (Norris was the goal-
keeper for the nation’s No. 1 high
school team last season.)

The Panthers attempted to make up
for the graduating players through
intense off-season recruiting.

“It’s a good recruiting class,”
Luxbacher said. “So far we’re pleased
with what we’re seeing.”

The players also feel positive
about this season’s recruits.

“The fr_e_sloirJr1Ne_r1‘yye added are a

right away.”

The pieces seem to be in place for
Pitt to have a dynamite season, and the
players have set some clear goals for
the team.

“My main goal this season is to
make the Big East Tournament [which
the top eight in the conference do], win
the Big East, and get Pitt’s first-ever
NCAA tournament bid,” said
Piombino.

Panther Rugby Club opens its doors to the student body

Patrick Robertson
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh men’s rugby
club comes into the 1997 fall league
season with minimal experience and a
lot of questions.

The team lost ﬁve seniors at
key positions last year. They are coming
off a disappointing 4th place ﬁnish out
of ﬁve teams in their league.

Coach Dan Talbert compares
his losses to those of a football coach
losing his starting running back, quar-
terback, linebacker, tailback and wide-
out. These losses leave big holes in the
Panthers’ lineup.

Talbert is looking to a variety

of places to ﬁll these holes. He hopes to
find some diamonds in the rough from
last year to plug into the lineup.

Talbert also has looked at many
high school players over the last year.

“There are ﬁnally some experi-
enced kids from local schools,” said the
coach, thankful that many of the local
schools have begun rugby programs.

I When this is the case, the coaching staff

does not have to spend as much time
teaching the basics of the game.

Talbert believes he has at least
five players con1ing in who he can work
with and maybe make into starters.

He is also looking toward the
ranks of former high school athletes to
fill out his roster. He hopes he can ﬁnd

ex—football, ex-basketball, ex-hockey
players, etc. to come out and give rugby
a try. Most athletes miss competition
and want to do something. Talbert
believes this is the perfect opportunity
for them to be part of a team.

Talbert said it is a “big, big
jump from high school to college
rugby,” and about half of the new play-
ers are going to have to step in and play
a big role on the team this year.

If Talbert had his way this year,
he would be able to work with the
freshmen and help them out before hav-
ing to throw them into the ﬁre right
away.

The Panthers will not waste any
time before competing for they meet

- 4:

Penn State Sept. 6 at noon in Happy
Valley. The Nittany Lions made it to the
Rugby National Championship last year
and are ranked No. 2 in the country
coming into this year.

Besides the opponent, Pitt faces
the added pressure of playing the
Nittany Lions just hours before the Pitt-
PSU football game kicks off at Beaver
Stadium. The added (and rabid) Penn
State fans, who will be in the midst of
preparations for their gridiron opener.

Talbert hopes the rugby match
between Pitt and Penn State will add to
the atmosphere of the football game on
the same day.

Still, Pitt will only begin prac-
tice on August 28. This will not give
them much time to prepare. Talbert said
most of the team is not able to come
back any earlier, so he has no choice.

“The rugby program had really
gone downhill before I took over as
coach [in fall 1996],” Talbert said.

When he took over, he had a
four—year plan. One of those years is
gone, and Talbert believes that in three
more years or so, Pitt will be playing
with, if not beating, the better teams
such as Penn State.

After the Penn State game,
Pitt’s league schedule gets a little easi-
er, and Talbert holds out hope for a
good season.

He believes that by the second
week or so, the rookies should be accli-
mated and his team should be ready to
do some damage.

He draws hope from a 6-4
record in lasteyear’s spring season. Four
of the teams on that schedule were
nationally ranked.

“The key to our team is that
you have fun,” said Talbert.

He opens his team to anyone
who wants to play, and he hopes to see
a lot of new faces at the ﬁrst practice,
held on the Cathedral Lawn.

It is a club sport, so anyone
who wishes to participate just needs to
attend, said Talbert.

they’ll just figuratively
slaughter them by winning
the game by 60 or so.

If you still don’t believe
me, think of it this way: I
would be scared to death to

-have a panther as a pet

because it would probably
eat me, but I wouldn’t be
scared at all to eat a helping
of Ragin’ Cajun’ fajitas. In
fact, I might actually enjoy it.

Evidence exists every-
where to support this theory.
Ever wonder why Temple
sucks? Their nickname is the
Owls. How menacing.

On the other hand, what
is more overpowering and

FROM PAGE 14

intimidating than a natural
disaster? Is it a coincidence
that the Miami Hurricanes
are the Big East preseason
favorites? Not if you ask me.

There are still a few
things about my theory that I
can’t totally explain. For
example, I know that a
Panther is a pretty fierce
creature, but I’m not exactly
sure why they’ve won only
15 games in the last six
years. I guess they’ve just
played a whole bunch of
even ﬁercer teams. V

I think the true test will
come next week when we
play Penn State; the Panthers

'I'I-IE PITT NEWS

versus the Nittany Lions.
Sounds like a pretty close
game to me. I’d be willing to
bet the Vegas spread will be
close, with Pitt probably a
two or three—point favorite.

Take it from me, Panther
fans — this is a sure thing.
While I’m not sure exactly
what the “Nittany” part of
Nittany Lions means, I do
know that Lions and
Panthers are pretty similar
creatures.

Here’s the catch, though:
Pitt’s mascot this year is a
meaner-looking Panther than
in years past. The Nittany
Lion is a pretty timid—looking
cat. This will prove to be the
deciding factor in an other-

wise close game. Credit the
win to Steve Pederson and
the revamped Pitt Athletic
department.

I’ve explained my foot-
ball prediction method to a
lot of people, and for some
reason not many people seem
to be buying into it. They tell
me I’m “blindly loyal” and
that I’m just trying to trick
myself into thinking my
favorite teams are better than
they really are. We’ll see
who’s laughing a few weeks
from now.

Brian Knavish is "a columnist
for The Pitt News, and his
loyalty to Pitt will eventually
lead to him being ﬂat broke.

October, and conference rivals
Connecticut and Notre Dame will
also make appearances in
Pittsburgh. The Lady Irish are the
No. 1 team in the country after
advancing to the national champi-
onship game last season.

If the Lady Panthers can get
through these games without losing
too much confidence, they should
be in good shape for the rest of the
season. A

The soccer program had a
turnout of about 40 interested play-
ers, which is very good news for a
second—year program.

After looking at his recruiting
class, Sturk is hopeful that his
freshmen_can come in and make a
difference early in the season.

Heather Ferguson and Vanessa
Madison are expected to come back
and lead this team again. Madison
ranked with Mora at the top of the
offensive chart, and Ferguson was a
vocal leader on defense, always
yelling at her opponents and com-
municating with her teammates.

The Big East Conference
should pose a challenge for this
still-young team. The squad makes
its conference debut against the
top-ranked Lady Irish on Sept. 12.
Youngstown State will be Pitt’s
first home opponent, as the two
clash on Labor Day at 7:15 at Pitt
Stadium.
