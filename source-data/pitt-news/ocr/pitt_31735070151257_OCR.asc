Board and presidential candidates must campaign
under its rules during the election cycle that begins
Oct. 31. The elections chairman ‘reviews all alleged
violations of the code and brings them before his com-
mittee, which then votes to decide if the allegations
merit a hearing. The committee then conducts the
hearing and directs appeals to the judicial committee.
Elections Chairman Aaron Gish and the commit-A
tee he oversees have met Boardjresistance regarding
code reform since last spring semester. v i 1

On April 9, Gish initially pro." osed 100 code revi-.

sions, including grammatical and mechanical changes
alongside more substantial ch'a_nges.vAn attempt to

remove themention of slates from the code was chief f 7'. '

among Gish’s changes. Slates include groups of two
or three Board or presidential candidates who run
together for the positions. A removal of the system
would require students to run as individual candi-
dates. .

The Board struck down this_ﬁrst proposal of the
code in a unanimous vote April 16. . A ‘

During a second proposal brought before the Board
on Sept. 3, Gish and his committee proposed 40 code
revisions, but did not remove slates from the code.

The code aimed to eliminate the ability for students to '

merge two slates and run asla larger group, breaking
from the megaslate system that allows six candidates
to run and campaign together as sister slates.

While sister slates are not a violation to the cur— '

rent code enforced by former Elections Chairwoman
Annie Brown, the issue fell under her discretion as
outlined in the code.

Among other changes, the second proposed code
aimed to clarify the role of the campaign manager, set
campaign spending limitations and address the num-
ber of endorsements a student organization can make.

The second proposal met resistance from the
Board, which felt that the change to limit candidate
endorsements to three Board member candidates
and one presidential candidate would create confu-
sion because students have the ability to vote for five
Board member candidates and one president. The

Lecture: Mummy genes guide researchonA|DS, leprosy

.   Abbey Reighard
For The Pitt News

Historians have long been aware of the
world’s deadliest epidemics, including
tuberculosis, malaria, smallpox, syphilis,
cholera and the plague. But some factors
surrounding diseases recorded in history
have vexed historians. .

“There are puzzles and holes in our
narrative,” historian Monica Green said,
referring to what she and her colleagues
know about leprosy. “Where did [leprosy]
start? How did it spread? If leprosy is
relatively new, then why do 95 percent
of humans have immunity toward it?”

The study of genetics is helping to
ﬁll in these gaps, said Green, an Arizona
State University history professor and
visiting scholar at Pitt. During-her Tues-
day afternoon lecture, which lasted from
4 to 5:30 p.m. in room 3703 of Posvar
Hall, she told an audience of about 20
people that microbiologists have been
reconstructing the historical narratives

noon. Zach Schaffer | Senior Staff Photographer ‘

of diseases through genetics.

Green explained that the scientists
do this by analyzing genomes in human
remains, allowing researchers to diag-
nose humans who have long been dead.
While these discoveries provide a better
understanding of the history, they have
clear implications for public health today.

“Everything we know about the history
of HIV is because of the work of geneti-
cism,” Green said.

She continued on to say that genetic
testing can use the DNA of mummies to
identify‘several diseases, such as lep-
rosy and AIDS, that still affect people on
a global scale today. Once researchers
ﬁnd these traces of diseases in human
remains, they use their discoveries to
build phylogenies, or family trees, that
show both the timeline and map of how
the diseases spread.

Green identiﬁed geneticism as a key

. “AIDS has helped us to think globally,

It has forced us, reluctantly forced us, to 1
move beyond ourfown narrative. It con— ,'

nects us all,” she said.

Until a little more than 10 years ago,..

Green said that researchers used texts
and artifacts, which then had to be in-
terpreted by historians, to identify dis-
eases that infected people in the past.
This method relies on historical records,
which are vulnerable to misinterpreta-
tion. '

Now, researchers are identifying
traces of pathogens in the DNA of hu-
man remains, which allows microbiolo-Q
gists to locate where historically relevant
diseases began and how far they spread.

“It’s extremely interesting to see his-.
tory and microbiology and geneticscome'
together to not justlook into the past,

b'ut"to work towéirdsthe future and to 
V dig up the genetic narrative and to use
_ historical information to ﬁght d_iseases,’_’.

“My generation of historians were
brought up with the belief that we can;-

Green said it was not possible to iden-
tify diseases retrospectively until the dis-
covery of pathogens located within DNA.

“The [Black] ‘Plague does not have a

get to everywhere else in the world? We

Given the recent increase in law-school
applications over the past few years,
students preparing or thinking about
attending law school should be aware
of the competitive edge required to get
into their school of choice.

Essentially, the preparation for law
school demands you be as cutthroat
and independent as you will be in your
ﬁrst—year law program, as there is no

set manner for establishing yourself as .

pre—law, unlike with other pre-graduate
academics. If you’re dead-set on attend-
ing law school post graduation, it’s best
to get a head start on gaining your com-
petitive edge.

Academically, there is a lot of ﬂex-
ibility in deciding_your major and course
of study before making the decision to
attend law school. Most advisers simply
encourage you to engage in a major that
requires a signiﬁcant amountof critical
reading and writing. ,

However, I’ve found that advisers are

course of study, which will in turn pre-

pare you for the most crucial aspect“'of

your application '— your LSAT score. x
In fact, the majors which score best

on the LSAT —— which comparatively .

weighs more than your GPA and extra-;
curricular life for most schools — are

those who chose ﬁelds related to the
sciences, likely because of the analytic
andsystematic training required for a
respectable LSAT score.»

Law so hard — even during your undergradyears

exam will register how well you studied‘

and the effectiveness of your test-taking
skills, which isn’t exactly whattypical
humanities majors boast. The best ad-
vice for this: Either choose a major that
you are completely passionate about or
one that will give you adequate exposure
to the skills you ultimately need come
LSAT time. '

- Another important aspect of a pre-
law career is undoubtedly working with—‘
in the ﬁeld and getting real-life experi-

difﬁcult to ﬁnd a job or internship that

will cater exactly to your future career‘

goal. However, there is ample oppor-
tunity to gain exposure to legal issues
within the Pittsburgh area.

‘ FOOTBALL

Trip to Heinz[Fie|

5 Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Wrz'ter

Among the crowd of 65,000 at
Pitt’s home opener Sept. 2 was
a group of young men who had
gathered for the ﬁrst time. Pitt
head football coach Paul Chryst
hopes it won’t be their last visit.

About 30 high school football
players and potential members of
Pitt’s 2013 recruiting class were in-
vited to Heinz Field for the show-
down, where they walked the ﬁeld
during pregame activities, sat in
the ﬁrst row on the 10-yard line
during the game and followed the
Panthers into the locker room af-
ter the game’s ﬁnal seconds.

“I tried to make everybody one
unit,” said Patrick Amara, who
verbally committed to Pitt,as a
safety injune. “I’m a good people
person. I’m good with relation-
ships. I feel good about all the
commits and potential commits.”

-V; 

 

. Qng-‘of the potential‘
Amara-‘refers to,  one who’ he
saildihe createdga sol'id‘:relationship
with, is Montae Nicholson, an un-
decided safetyfrom Gateway High
School in Monroeville, Pa., who is

regarded by many recruiting sites -

— including Rivals.com — as the
No. 1 prospect in Pennsylvania.

, The 6-foot-2. 200—pound
Nicholsonraved about Pitt’s play
against Florida State, saying the

outcor_ne,was just_a matter of ﬁn- A

   

        

ishing"‘1_l_‘-.'he game. _' 

“The positive ts;thatith_
out hard. The obvibqus ownside
was they didn’t ﬁnish hard. My
former coach [Terry Smith] used
to preach to me all the time. For
us it’s 48 minutes, but you can’ call
it just a little bit longer.”

Smith, who coached at Gate-
way until 2012, is now an assistant

 coach at Temple University. [One

of N icholson’s best friends and
longtime teammate at Gateway,

 

Anthony Davis, verbally commit-
ted to Temple two months ago.

Davis was in attendance Monday, 4,

and following the game rumors
began to swirl about Davis pos-

sibly decommitting from Temple. .

Nicholson addressed the situ-
ation with Davis and insinuated
that he is letting the situation play
itself out ratherthan attempting

. to lure Davisfrom one school to

another. ‘

 _f‘Itwould be atotal. coincidence .
_ H . ifiAie.both.committedto the same
came ‘

place,” Nicholson said. “He’s look-
ing for his school, and I’m looking
for my school.”

A 6—foot—1, 175-pound cor-
nerback, Davis is ranked as the
10th-best player in Pennsylvania,
according to Scout.com. '

Another player inattendance
that night was Adam Bertke, a

6-foot-5, 210~pound quarterback . 

who played at Marion Local High
Schooliin Maria Stein, Ohio.’ Like

Amara, Bertke also verbally com-
mitted to Pitt injune.

A All three players paid close
attention to Pitt players at their
positions‘. For Bertke, it was Torn
Savage.

“They took their shots with ’

Savage. I thought even though he
threw a couple picks, he was still
pretty impressive. I thought he
played really well,‘and I thought
Coach Rudolph did a good job with
the offense,” Bertke said.

For Amara and Nicholson, the
players to watch werejason Hen-
dricks and'Ray Vinopal.

“The basic thing is just wrap-
ping up and ﬁnishing the tackle.
That’s all I saw really. They have
to just stay strong after contact,”
said Nicholson.

Amara did not seem discour-
aged by the loss.

[Florida State quarterback] jameis
Winston — he carries [his team]
— he deserves everything. There’s
nothing really that Pitt did wrong.
They’ll show improvement.”

’ The potential recruits also
talked about the stadium’s atmo-
sphere Monday night. ‘

“Heinz Field was packed,”
Bertke said. “It was a great thing
to be a part of. It was just a great
atmosphere.”

“The student section was going
crazy. It was a ﬁill house, and I was
real impressed with the environ-
ment,” Amara said. “Every person
could say the same.”

This seems to be the main rea-
son Amara and Bertke will stay
true to their commitments. When

asked if the game’s final score had -
any bearings on his commitment '

status, Berke said that nothing will

“No,” Bertke said. “I’m still the

Pirates’. 

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Celebrating 82 wins and a long-
awaited above-average season
isn’t easy.

 When the Pittsburgh Pirates
notched this monumental victory
Monday in Arlington, Texas, over
the Texas Rangers, I didn’t know
what to do with myself: Scream in
sheer joy? Rub my eyes in disbelief?

 Shortly after Andrew McCutch-
the face of the Pirates franchise,
held his arms out beside him and
gazed up in reverence of the 1-0
 my phone lit up. V

 was a text from my older
bfpther, who entrenched my love
fdi-ibasebaﬂ and the Pirates over
 past 20 years. His message

   

simple words that Pirate fans had
waited for two decades to say: “It’s
over!!!!!!”

A few more messages came
ﬂooding in a group text between
my brother, my two sisters, our par-
ents and I. Someone mentioned

' that this season of tangible success
‘and progress still hasn’t set in —

and it hasn’t.

So, ‘although 82 is just an arbi-
trary number to some, it’s awater-
shed moment for Pirate fans that
calls for some rumination on the
period left behind.

For the past decade or so, I re-

p member how fans and critics end-

lessly griped that the Pirates were
losing 90, sometimes 100 games‘,
but were still giving away bobble-
heads, blasting Zambelli ﬁreworks

and  crowds 6t‘I{&3;‘r"

promotional gimmicks.

. ‘ Yet the Pirates never garnered
enough attention to lure more than
25,000 fans per game after PNC
Park’s inaugural season in 2001.
Even injune 2007, when belea-
guered general manager David
Littleﬁeld was nearing the end of
his abominable tenure and after_he
had selected college reliever Daniel
Moskos with the fourth overall pick
in that summer’s draft, fans staged
awalkout.

They bought tickets, walked in '

the gates, picked up their replica
bobbleheads and left just a few in-‘
nings later. I remember being on
vacation at the beach when this
happened and watching the news
to witness the exodus of people
__porting green shirts that read

And yet I’m willingto wagerthat
those fans went home and placed
theirpromotional bobbleheads on
a mantle. _

This wasn’t anything ground-
breaking. I had watched people ﬂee
the stadium, giveaway in hand, in
the decade’s worth of games I at-
tended as a season-ticket holder
with my family.

The desk in my bedroom is
adorned with bobbleheads that
have accumulated over the years, a
relic of faux heroes, many of whom
didn’t deserve to be immortalized
with a spring-loaded porcelain
head. ' . '

There’s thejason Bay 2005 All-
Star edition, in which he sports
the orange National League jersey
with a Canadian ﬂag because the

wasa global set. Bay, of course, re-
sponded by not launching a single
homer in the derby. '

The bobblehead is half-price on
eBay now, listed at a reasonable
$7.49. ,

There’s the trio of bouncing
domes on players who were some-
how touted as the team’s ﬁituifez
Ryan Doumit, Chris Duffy and Zath
Duke. To akid who had been blind-
ed by a lifetime of lending support
and fandom to replacement-level
players, they appeared to be savidrs
for a while.  I

When I moved, those bobble ‘

heads remained at my familffs
house. The only one that made
trip to my apartment in Pittsburgh
was Andrew Mccutchen. 5

The Pittsburgh Steelers are in trou-
ble: A 16-9 loss to the Tennessee
Titans conﬁrmed that.

In fact, the loss should be viewed

. more as a 16-0 loss. The Steelers

were gift—wrapped two points on
a safety when Tennessee retumer
Darius Reynaud made a mental mis-
take on the game’s opening kickoff.

The Steelers scored a touch-
down in the fourth quarter, but that
was primarily a result of the Titans
playing prevent defense the entire
drive with the game’s outcome al-
ready well in hand.

For every single one of the 60
minutes played. Sunday, Tennessee
was the better team.

For perspective, the Titans ﬁn-
ished last season 6-10 and out of
playoff contention. The Titans’ de-
fense ﬁnished .No. 27 in the league

 
 

scoring defense at 29.4 points al
lowed per game. "
That sameATitans defense held
the Steelers to 195 net yards of of-
fense. ‘

But no, Ijm sureﬂsteelers fans

aren’t worried that wide receiver
Mike Wallace and running back
Rashard Mendenhall don’t wear
black and gold anymore.

Speaking of running backs and
receivers, the Steelers’ ground
game mustered only 32 yards on
15 attempts against a defense that
allowed 127.2 yards per game last
season. On the outside, the longest
pass completed all daywas a 22-yard
completion to Antonio Brown.

Meanwhile, in his ﬁrst nine at-
tempts as a member of the Arizona
Cardinals, Rashard Mendenhall
rushed for 35 yards. Mendenhall

Draping my walls are canvas photos — one p

his helmet lifted high above his head after a .

I have no Steelerslior Penguins memora-
bilia. I’ve seen those"'teams win enough'to
know the thrill of celebrating their success.

But I’ve never experienced that feeling
with the Pirates or with baseball, the team
and sport I’m most infatuated with.

The most exciting part about this sea-

every defense the Steelers defense is essen-
tially what netted Antonio Brown his six—year,
$48-million contract.

This money could’ve gone to Wallace —
you know, the receiver who in his ﬁrst four
seasons put up numbers that are nearly identi-
cal to those of the Detroit Lions’ Calvinjohnson
when it comes to catches, touchdowns, yards
and yards per catch.

Moving forward, the Steelers lost Pounc-
ey, linebacker Larry Foote and running back
LaRod Stephens—Howling to season-ending
injuries. Stephens-Howlingtore his ACL, and
Foote suffered a ruptured bicep.

Now, Dwyer is back in the fold after Ste-
phens—Howling’s injury, and the Steelers need
to quickly ﬁnd a starting linebacker.

Regardless of what happens on the ﬁeld,
though, there is no real reason to hold out any
hope for this 2013 version of the Steelers. And
it’s becoming readily apparent there aren’t any
reasons for hope in the future, either.

Starting with the decisions to allow Men-
denhall and Wallace to go, and following
through with the decision to ﬁre Bruce Arians
to bring in Todd Haley the ownership of these
Steelers is now the real concern.

Remember Arians? The guy who was the

- offensive coordinatorin the run to a Super

Bowl victory and then when the Steelers made

' another one in2o11?

Steelers: fans and management ran him
out of town, and what has he done since then?
He won the Coach of the Year Award last sea-
son when he wasn’t even a coach and then
landed himselfa j ob as the head coach of the
Cardinals. _ _

On to Haley, Roethlisberger completed
24 passes Sunday and ﬁnished with less than

. 200 yards. Something is wrong with that,

and that something features the sequences
when Haley calls three consecutive plays to
Stephens—Howling, resulting in a three-and-
out or three consecutive passes to Redman
from inside the red zone.

In the ﬁrst half, Roethlisberger averaged
about 9 yards per completion when he went
10-of-14 for 94 yards. That’s terrible. A good

quarterback averages between 8 and 9 yards ‘

per attempt, not completion.

Butwhile Haley is on the sidelines and the
same mentality exists in the Steelers front of-
ﬁce, nothingwill improve — not in 2013 and
not in the foreseeable future. 3 l
