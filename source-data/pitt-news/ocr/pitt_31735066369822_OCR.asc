Health Center Helicopter
Fights To Get Off Ground

By CHERYL SIRKO

A new transportation system
to help patients get to area hospi-
tals quicker during emergencies
will be initiated this November.

Pitt's Center for Emergency
Medicine will provide a new Spe-
cialized Treatment and Trans-
port System (STAT), involving
not only improved ground trans-
portation, but air transportation
as well.

“What we have now doesn’t
work," said Joel Ettinger, execu-
tive vice-president of STAT. “A
land-air merge is better."

Such a land-air service already
exists at Allegheny General Hos-
pital in the form of the Life
Flight helicopter. A debate con-
tinues over the need for a second
helicopter service in the Pitts-
burgh area.

“ls it better to have competi-
tion?“ Ettinger asked. “We need
more helicopters, and the laws of
economics say that competition
can lead to better service."

many people need this service,"
he said.

West Penn Hospital pulled out
of the STAT program after being
part of the original plan.

“We want competence. not
competion," Barbara Haas of
West Penn’s community rela-
tions office said. “We would like
to see Allegheny General and the
university hospitals get together
with one system."

At Allegheny General, Life
Flights rates depend on the time
and distance of each call. It cost
$ l 50 for Life Flight to lift off. $75
an hour for the two nurses
aboard and $8 per mile in travel
costs. Standard procedure is to
bill the receiving hospital,
according to Peterson. Blue
Cross will usually reimburse 100
percent of this cost he said.

However. Ettinger said that it
will cost approximately $1,000
each time the STAT helicopter is
used and that whatever costs
insurance fails to cover will be
absorbed by the hospital deficit.

Allegheny General's Life
Flight will continue to take the
patients it serves to any local hos-
pital the doctor requests.

“For years. there’s been com-
petition between Allegheny and
the university hospitals, particu-
larly Presby.” Peterson said.
“When Allegheny began Life
Flight [five years ago], we asked
the Oakland hospitals to partici-
pate. They didn’t want to.

“When it became a success,
everyone wanted to get on the
bandwagon. We met a year ago
to discuss merging the two pro-
grams [Life Flight and STAT],
but Mr. Ettinger hasn‘t con-
tacted us since then.”

Peterson added that he is still
willing to talk about merging
Allegheny‘s program with
STAT.

The STAT team consists of a
highly trained and experienced
group of physicians, nurses and
other critical care professionals.

loped over the years at each of

SGB Retains
QPA Standards

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The question of whether the min-
imum required QPA for holding a
position on the Student Govern-
ment Board should be lowered from
2.5 to 2.0 was raised at Wednesday's
SGB meeting.

The board voted four to three
with one abstention on the issue of
forming a constitutional review
committee to look into the matter.
Since the necessary majority was not
achieved, however, the issue was
dropped.

Voting to form the committee
were Kathy Brown, Jeff [)elmon-
tagne, Ken Strain and Dan Lecce.
and voting against were Craig Mur-
phey, Mindy Goldberg and Jeff
Schaffer. Barry Green abstained.

“I believe that any student in good
academic standing should be able to
run for the board if he maintains a
2.5 while in office,” said Chuck
Quinlan, who spoke before the
board.

Quinlan proposed that the QPA
requirement be changed from 2.5 to
2.0 while running for office, with the
stipulation that any of the members-
elect whose QPA fell below 2.0 as a
result of the campaign would not be
allowed to take office, forfeiting to
the next highest vote-getter.

Quinlan collected 300 student sig-
natures in an effort to meet the
requirement of 5 percent of the stu-
dent body necessary to make a con-
stitutional amendment.

Getting Into Pitt

“There are many ways to become
involved in student government
without becoming a member of the
board,” said Mindy Goldberg. “The
student shouldn‘t be worried while
on the board about falling into aca-
demic probation."

The board also discussed taking
over the responsibility of printing
student discount cards this year.
University Services Associates, the
Missouri-based company previously
hired to do the printing, has been
neglecting its job, according to
Schaffer.

“Right now, it‘s hopeless as far as
getting in contact with the people
who were originally to make up the
cards," he said.

The card, which will include more
specials from Oakland-based mer-
chants than last years, will cost stu-
dent government about $55 to print.

Among other business: the board
is asking for a non-smoking section
in the Schenley Cafe located in the
William Pitt Union; Ken Stram is
looking for a more organized way to
register for computer science classes;
Kathy Brown is working on revising

some of the “outdated” bylaws
under which the SGB has been
working; and the Academic Affairs
Committee will be sending out a sur-
vey to all on-campus students, ask-
ing them what they think the
committee should be doing.

What Does It Take?

By PAM CYGRYMUS

Did you ltnowthat the majority of
freshmen accepted to Pitt this year
were in the upper fifth of their high
school classes and had SAT scores
averaging I050? According to Dr
Joseph Merante, director of admis-
sions and student aid, this was
indeed the case.

In addition, the number of fresh-
men applications this year to Pitt's
undergraduate program increased
by 15 per cent over last year, but the
freshmen class increased by only 5
percent. Merante said.

How does the university deter-
mine which applications to accept
and which to reject‘?

“The key to the [present] process
is the identification of the student‘s
strengths and weaknesses,” Merante
said.

Each application is reviewed on
the basis of six criteria, Merante
said. The first and most important of
these is grades. Also taken into con-
sideration are high school class
rank, scores on standardized tests
like the SAT, counselor and teacher
recommendations, letters of evalua-

tion regarding positions of responsi-
bility and leadership, and finally a
regression correlation. This correla-
tion uses a combination ofclass rank
and math and verbal SAT scores to
predict an applicant's future QPA in
his chosen program.

According to Merante, all of the
applicants are reviewed in accor-
dance with this process.

The present procedures have been
in use for quite some time, but other
methods have been used in the past
to predict an applicant’s potential
success at Pitt. These methods were
based on sex, resident or commuter
status,lQ scores, class rank, SAT
scores, and the program applied for.

Class rank and verbal SAT scores
are usually the best indicators of a
student's potential success, accord-
ing to Merante, except in the engi-
neering program, where math scores
carry more weight. For a female
engineering student, he said, class
rank is an even better indicator.

Once an application has been
reviewed, the applicant is either
rejected, accepted or referred to
another program, perhaps the Col-

Students, Hospitals
Work Hand in Hand

By TIM HUNTER

Local hospitals and Pitt students
have found themselves in a recipro-
cal relationship. The hospitals need
volunteers to do everything from
process medical records to assist
anesthesiologists. The students in
return get experiences not available
in the classroom.

For example, Chris Greco, a Pitt
pre-med and chemistry student who
volunteers in the anesthesia depart-
ment at Presbyterian-University
Hospital, was able to observe differ-
ent types of major surgery such as
heart and liver transplants.

“The people that I worked with
were very helpful in answering my
questions,” she said. “The surgery
that I saw and the practical expe-
rience that I obtained will be a great
help for me in the future."

“Once an individual has proven
himself with his initial responsibili-
ties, I often see an evolution of the
job description that is more interest-
ing and challenging to the volun-
teer," said Dawn Reading, director
of volunteer services at
Presbvterian.

Along with providing an educa-
tional experience. volunteering can
help a student decide upon profes-
sional plans.

lege of General Studies or a branch

Branch campuses provide a good
opportunity for students who may
not have done well in high school,
Merante said.

“It puts them in a situation where
they get a little more attention than
they would on the main campus," he
said.

Merante has noticed some chang-
ing trends among the applicants
being accepted. First, there are more
female students than male. Pitt's
engineering program has a larger

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

“We provide opportunities in
which the students can test their
future careers," Reading said. “After
about one semester of volunteer
work, the students usually know if
thev are pursuing the proper career."

Another benefit that the hospital
volunteer receives is a chance to help
and care for others, especially chil--
dren. Children's Hospital has a spe-
cial department called “Child Life,"
in which the volunteer helps and
plays with the children in activities
designed to divert their attention
from the hospital surroundings.

“Lots of tender, loving care is
necessary," said Mildred Milsak,
acting volunteer coordinator at
Children's. "We need people who
are not rushed and are willing to
take out some time to hold and com-
fort a child."

There are currently about I30 stu-
dent volunteers working at Chil-
dren‘s and Presbyterian. The
emergency room, intensive care.
physical therapy, medical photogra-
phy. dental clinics, pharmacy labs.
data processing and medical records
are among the areas in which stu-
dents have opportunities to work.

Those interested in volunteering
should go to the volunteer offices in
one of the hospitals or call Dawn
Reading at 647-3 I85.

Also, Merante noticed that. in the
past, most of Pitt's applicants were
from the Western Pennsylvania
area. Now, there are more appli-
cant’s from othe parts of Pennsylva-
nia as well as a significant increase in
the number of out-of-state
applicants.

He attributed this increase to the
low cost of an education at Pitt. and
“allowing families to understand
that there is a difference between

Lend A Hand

This fall, for the first time in decades, the fraternity
system at- Pitt held a dry open rush.

No alcohol of any kind was served to the rushees
who checked out the Greek system during the first two
weeks of school. The immediate switch from a wet to a
dry rush undoubtedly had to be a major adjustment
for the members of Pitt’s 21 fraternities.

The decision to go dry was made by the Interfrater-
nity Council (IFC) last winter and was not surprising
to many people because of the rumors that were circu-
lating from the Student Activities Office.

Last _fall, committees were set up by the Student
Affairs Office to study drinking habits in three areas:
the residence halls, the Greek system and student
groups in general.

The buzz that was coming out of these committees
was that they were going to recommend the banning of
all alcohol in all three areas; it was just a matter of time
until they announced it.

IFC was able to anticipate this and devised its own
dry rush policy instead of waiting for the administra-
tion to tell it what to do. This policy was readily
accepted by the university.

Whether the new dry rush policy has had any effect
on the success of this term’s rush remains to be seen;
the numbers aren’t in, but there have been positive
responses filtering out from the fraternity system.

In Wednesday’s paper, Sigma Chi president Harry
Kunselman raised some valid points that should be
addressed by the university. Kunselman pointed out
that the university made no concerted effort to help the
fraternities implement the new policy.

There were no workshops or speakers scheduled to
help the fraternities plan their fall rush. There was no
literature or letters sent out to the fraternities advising
them how to properly handle the new policy or offer-
ing any type of alternatives to alcohol.

They were stuck with a policy and were forced to
implement it without any help from the administra-
tion. Also, the new Greek adviser, Bridget Guernsey,
did not begin her duties until Aug. 1; she barely had
enough time to get used to her new job, let alone
schedule some sort of workshop or lectures.

Pitt has shown in the past that it believes in the
Greek system. It is spending millions of dollars build-
ing eight new fraternity houses; it supports the system
during Greek Week and has done many things to help
the system survive. One would think the university
would come to the aid of the system when it was
necessary.

It's too late for fall rush, but not for winter rush. The
administration needs to get involved and educate the
Greek system about running a successful dry rush.

After all, rush is survival time for the Greek system,
and Pitt should help them survive.

Letters To The Editor

Column Needs More Research

Dear Editor:

On the inside looking out at Mon-
day's opinion column on sorority
rush by “responsible" journalist
Todd Erkel, one phrase says it all: “I
simply do not understand the

‘ process.“

After openly admitting his igno-
rance, one wonders why he was fool-
ish enough to continue. Research or
first-hand experience provide a

much more credible basis for an arti-
cle than conjuring up age-old stereo-
types and passing them off as truth.
And during which term did you par-
ticipate in sorority rush, Mr. Erkel?

Yes, it's that time of year again, as
Pitt’s illustrious journalist so
observantly points out for us; time

for a news editor to use The Pitt
News as a forum to air his misin-
formed fantasies. Sorority rush is a
type of orientation for prespective
members, a priviledge any organiza-
tion has the right to enjoy.

Contrary to your opinion, Mr.
Erkel, sororites are full of women
participating in organizations of
which they are proud, and not of
girls wailing for bits of Daddy's
checkbook to assuage identity
crises. This pride is displayed as a
pin or even an extravagant $6 let-
tered T-shirt. If pride is to be called
elitism, so be it.

Greeks are charity —— and service
~— oriented groups, a fact partly
made possible by the fees you speak
of. Should a member require finan-

cial assistance, each national soror-
ity has its own program for
scholarships and loans, a detail you
fail to mention. And friends met
through this communal living you so
ptpenly criticize are friends made for
l e.

Each member of a group shares
some group identity, a characteristic
of all organizations not excluding
fraternal ones. Do Pitt News writers
share no common traits? Hopefully
that commonality is not in the prac-
tice of printing warped views from
the “outside."

Dear Editor:

that appeared in The Pitt News
on Friday, Sept. 16. I feel that
Professor Cohen was being very
biased towards nuclear energy.
He said that “if all of the electric-

ated from nuclear power, the
radiation emitted would proba-

Veterans Cut Through Governmental Red Tape

By MIKE eucsxo

The hassles and delays a normal
student encounters with the bureau-
cratic machinery of the university
system are nothing new to August
Michel, a veteran who also finds
himself dealing with the federal
government to collect his beneﬁts
under the GI Bill.

“Initially, it took me seven
months to get my benefits started,“
Michel said.

Michel is one of an estimated 500-
525 veterans who annually enrolls at
Pitt for the Fall and Winter terms —
300-325 in the Spring and Summer
— through the Veterans Adminis-
tration's (VA) ‘campus liason, the
Office of Veterans Benefit Services.

Two university full-time
employees and nine VA work-study
veteran/ students work in theﬁoffice,

located on the seventh floor of the
William Pitt Union. The main task
of the employees is to certify vete-
rans attending Pitt and to make sure
their paperwork is sent to the VA for
processing.

After four semesters, Michel app-
lied for a work-studyjob at the Vete-
rans Office and began working there
last winter. Work-study students
assist coordinator Donald Graffius
and senior certifications clerk Sue
McCombs in filling out the various
forms necessary for veteran certifi-
cations. Michel said his accessibility
to the VA paperwork has helped
increase his knowledge of benefits.

“It's very helpful in finding out
how the VA system works and get-
ting to know who is working in the
system," he said. “You know who to
go to to resolve the various problems
that arise."

Although Graffius is in charge,
the majority of the paperwork falls
on the desk of McCombs. Her duties
include sending forms to the VA
regional office in the William S.
Moorehead Federal Building in
Pittsburgh, verifying completion of
courses for payment by the VA,
helping veterans apply for Tutorial
Assistance and submiting Educa-
tional Assistance Inquiries (EAI).

McCombs regrets the delays that
sometime delay the receipt of educa-
tional benefits.

“We can only do so much," she
said. “Once the paperwork's gone,
it's out of our hands."

McCombs said the office takes
measures to insure that paperwork
lands in the right hands at the VA by

- hand-carrying all forms. Even with

this seemingly foolproof method of
submitting paperwork, what
happens when the forms reach the
VA is the government's responsibil-
ity, and forms are often lost in the
avalanche of paperwork at the VA.
McCombs said this is where EAls
come in.

EAls are inquiries into the non-
receipt or incorrect amount of
benefit checks from the VA. The
amount of the check and the period
covered by its payment is entered on
the EAI, and Graffius then calls the
VA representatives at the Federal
Building to check the problem. He
usually receives an answer on how to
advise the veteran by the next work-
ing day, McCombs said.

There are four types of VA educa-
tional benefits, according to
McCombs: Chapter 31 (Vocational
Rehabilitation); Chapter 32 (Vete-
rans Educational Assistance Pro-

gram, referred to as VEAP);
Chapter 34 (GI Bill); and Chapter 35
(Dependents). .

Recent Congressional legislation
provides for an extension of benefits
if the veteran has reached his delim-
iting date under Chapter. 34, but
only for vocational training or cer-
tificate programs. McCombs said
the legislation is causing confusion
among veterans eager to attend
school but whose benefits have run
out.

“A lot of [veterans] ran out of
benefits and want to continue their
education [under the extension],”
McCombs said. “Unfortunately,
most of them aren't eligible."

Michel qualifies under Chapter 31

because of a back injury he incurred ~

while on active duty. Originally
rated at 60 percent disability, he now
finds himself rated at only l0 per-
cent, due to what he considers a doc-
tor’s error during a periodic checkup
last February.

“The doctor who performed the
exam determined that l was no
longer disabled,” Michel said. “He
didn't even look at the X-rays."

ln dollars, Michel explained that
his monthly subsistence dropped
from $497 to $62 a month because of
the cut in his disability rating. As a
single parent with a mortgage pay-
ment, two teenage sons and attend-
ing Pitt full-time, he is havinga hard
time making ends meet.

“l‘ve been working on getting it
straightened out since April,“
Michel said, “but my claim is still
pending in front of the VA review
board.) _

Bureaucratic procedures like
review boards, resubmission of

forms and verification of depen-
dency status (submitting marriage
licenses and birth certificates to‘ the
VA) are just some of the problems
veteran / students encounter, accord-
ing to McCombs. She said the office
tries to be as helpful as possible,
from checking payment on a pay
cycle that is circulated several times_
monthly for the majority of students
to assisting veterans in quick and
easy form ﬁling.

Although the certification proce-
dure varies for the different chap-
ters, McCombs said all students
should have copies or originals of
their school invoice and registration
when applying for benefits. New
veteran/students should have VA
certified copies of their separation
papers (VA Form DD-2l4) and VA
certified copies of marriage licenses
and birth certificates, if applicable.
Dependents should know the vete-
ran's VA file number. Students are
required to go through the certifica-
tion procedure at the beginning of
every semester, and McCombs sug-
gests they do it as soon as possible.

“Get in here as soon as you receive
your bill and registration,“ she said,
adding, “and the bill doesn't have to
be paid to apply for benefits "

Michel, who spent over l2 years in
the Army and was discharged as a
Chief Warrant Officer 2. said the
only problem he has encountered at
Pitt is in relating to younger
students.

“lt’s sometimes difficult relating
on a personal level," he said, “with
people who are some I0 years
younger than you are, but on an aca-
demic level, there's no problem."

‘zelie’: Woody Pulls out

By RICHARD SATER

Susan Sontag refers to Leonard
Zelig as ”THE phenomenon of the
’20s." According to Irving Howe,
Zelig was ”as well-known as Lind-
bergh”; but as Saul Bellow points out,
the same Leonard Zelig faded quickly
from vogue. But who was he?

Leonard Zelig, a mild-mannered
fellow, attracted attention with his
ability to assume the identity of
anyone he came in contact with —— a
singular talent, certainly. Seems the
problem had taken root during his
youth; anxious to conform, he'd said
that he had read Moby Dick, although
he hadn't.

His extraordinary life has now
been arranged on film. Zelig, writer/
director/star Woody Allen's latest,
examines a common complaint —- the
identity crisis —— and carries it to an
absurd extreme. The film was two
years in the making, and if Allen has
been accused lately of self-
indulgence, Zelig provides absolution.
Within a conventional framework —
the documentary, a la Citizen Kane -
Allen’s newest is brilliant, a fortunate
blend of writing, acting and editing,
in particular.

Allen's mind is incredibly fertile.
Increasingly, young Zelig found him-
self able to adapt his shape; later, with
no conscious effort, he could become
Indian, black, Chinese, intelligent,
obese — in the proper company. Pos-
sibilitiesare immense. Tagged ”the
Human Chameleon," Zelig experien-
ces brief, instant celebrity in the 19205
and puzzles the psychiatrists who
hospitalize and attempt to question
and understand this reticent man.

Exploited ‘by an opportunistic sister
and her volatile lover, Zelig barn-
storms the country, displaying his
talent for the curious hordes. The
nation —' indeed the world —— takes
him to heart, and the fad spreads.
Popular songs like ”You May Be Six
People But I Love You" and a new
Chameleon dance step set the masses
jumping. Zelig billboards proclaim,
”We smoke Camels.” There are
wristwatches, toys, games — all of it

in execrable taste. And Zelig remains
a non-person, a cipher.

Eudora Fletcher — a "woman doc-
tor" and therefore, innovative —- sur-
renders her career to Zelig’s case,
hoping to discover a cure and estab-
lish her reputation. Personal ties
develop between doctor and patient;
under hypnosis he reveals the
motive behind his peculiarity: ’’I want
to be liked,” he says in a poignant
moment. Legal complications arise;
should Zelig be held responsible for
acts committed while he was some-
one else?

In the manner of an old Movietone
News segment, the story is pieced
together through filmed footage of
sessions between Zelig and his doc-
tors, modern interview clips of
selected associates and commenta-
tors, movie newsreels, newspaper
articles and headlines and still photo-
graphs. Leonard Zelig’s complicated
life is dissected, and Patrick Horgan
narrates the proceedings with the
requisite amount of pomp. But the
point of view is ever-changing, and
finally, no conclusions can be drawn
about the "real” Zelig.

Woody Allen is, of course, Leonard

Experﬂy Desienedcharacters
Make ‘Baby’ A Success

By DELORES RICE

Most of us are too young to have
been teenagers in the mid-1960s, and
most of us were not born in Trenton,
N.J., but in John (Return of The Secacous
7) Sayles’ latest film, Baby It's You, you
are drawn into a very familiar world.
Even though the styles, music and
activities are different compared to
our high school years, the experien-
ces and feelings that Sayles’ expertly
designed characters encounter are
very real to us.

The film begins with Jill (Rosanna
Arquette) and Sheik (Vincent Spano)
making eye contact in the crowded
halls of Trenton High School. Jill is
the daughter of a wealthy doctor, an
active member of her school's drama
club who's popular with everyone.
Sheik is the son of a garbageman, a

thief, (he steals to buy his image-
seeking clothes) and a problem stu-
dent. Match made in heaven right?
Not really. The familiar effects of
peer pressure, competition, ambition
and pride take their toll and force the
two apart. Jill is accepted and leaves
for snotty Sarah Lawrence College,
and Sheik, fleeing from the police,
escapes to Flordia.

Jill's perfect life in high school is
shattered when she arrives on cam-
pus and is treated like an outcast.
Alcohol, drugs and sex become part
of her life as she strives to be accepﬁd
by her peers. Nothing seems to work,
She begins to realize the way Sheik
must have felt. Jill decides to go to
Sheik, but when she arrives in Flor-
dia, she finds him mouthing the
words to songs on the jukebox in a
gaudy night club. Jill realizes their

lives are just too different to ever
mix. Finally giving in to reality, she
returns to Sarah Lawrence.

Sayles concentrates fully on devel-
oping Jill and Sheik throughout the
film. He does not detract from them
by adding unnecessary characters or
scenes. The simple, yet defining
details, such as Jill's doodling her
name within a Broadway marquee in
history class and Sheik’s hidden dis-
appointment at not making the bas-
ketball team, add to the viewer's
emotional attachment and familiarity
with the film. Arquette and Spano
make the characters believable and
worth caring about. The situations
they encounter are certain to ring
bells in your memory.

Each scene is complemented by fit-
ting music. The soundtrack consists
of some original ’60s’ music including

]"lw_s'm-..;
The Stops

Zelig, perfectly and likeably cast.
Allen's little man is shy and awkward
and funny, but humanly so this time,
despite the rational impossibility of
the story. Allen is worked, without
anachronism, into footage with Babe
Ruth, Adolf Hitler, Calvin Coolidge
and.other notables of the era.

As Dr. Eudora Fletcher, Mia Far-
row performs with efficiency; some-
how, though, she seems conspicuous
at times when Allen merges well.
Perhaps she is too softly feminine to
fit into the hard-crack and white-
painted mold of the 1920s’ modern
maiden. But Zelig accepts her,
prompting the audience to do the
same. Their close contact expands
into trust, love and then marriage.
The closing sequence of the film
offers a succession of radiant, ama-
teur still photographs of the couple, a
well-worn recording of ”l’ll Get By
(as Long as I Have You)” providing
accompaniment — a memorably
warm, lump-in-throat conclusion.

Tremendous applause goes to the
technical staff who accomplished the
seamless blend of Woody Allen's
image into old photographs and
newsreel footage. Their scrupulous
work is remarkably unobtrusive;
without disturbing the quality of the
original material, they've managed to
recreate the grainy jump and slightly
accelerated, flickery quality of old
film and also the perfect muted-gray
hazi-ness of the old stills. The home-
movie sequences are jerky and
unskilled, the subjects typically
camera shy. The age of the stuff is
reinforced by apparent breaks in the
film, which temporarily throw the
soundtrack’s continuity. Transcrip-
tions of Zelig’s voice and recordings
of popular songs retain the thin and
monotone scratch. The work is beau-
tifully, reverently nostalgic
throughout.

Zelig questions conformity and
identity; it's also got drama, humor,
‘romance, intrigue and music to sup-
port the theme. Certainly the docu-
mentary format isn't new, but Allen
reminds us of its validity through
exploration of possibilities.

the film's title, ”Baby It's You" sung
by The Shirelles. Bruce Springsteen's
throaty voice throughout the film is
the scene-music paralleled
soundtrack.

Baby It's You is so compelling
because we can identi.fy so well wﬂh
the characters and their experiences.
The film is sensitive in its journey to
understanding what the real world is
all about. Baby, It's You is a must for
those who can remember the transi-
tional years of adolescence.

' Showcase, Friday, September 23, 1983.

Following its ”curtain raiser” pro-
duction of Catch 22, the theatrical
equivalant of a pre—season football
game for season subscribers, the
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre is
currently preparing The Gin Game as
the official opening production of its
12th season.

Bill Royston, artistic director at the
Lab, is directing the show which he
calls "'a natural season opener.”

{hat quote not withstanding, the
show and this season are at least a
small departure for the company in
that all five of the scheduled plays
were originally produced on Broad-
way. It's not the first time the Lab has
fetched its fare from the Great White
Way, but it is the first time an entire
season has been devoted to such com-
mercially established drama.

”Basically, we're doing them
because we want to do them," Roys—~
ton said. "I think they'll work as well,
if not better, in our space."

Royston cited The Gin Game, which
is set on the porch of a senior citizens’
home, as an example.

”I have trouble imagining that
seedy old porch on a large stage. it
will certainly be much more intimate
here.”

The Lab, with seating for 100, is
about one—tenth the size of the aver-
age Broadway house.

Royston added that the current
season aiso reflects his personal
interest in producing American
works rather than the shows by
European playwrights that charac-
terized the bulk of past seasons.

The Gin Game was the first effort of
Dallas playwright D.L. Coburn. His
work was rewarded when the show
received the 1977 Pulitzer Prize.

As mentioned, the play is set on an
outer porch of a senior citizens’
home.‘ It is here that the show’s only
two characters, Weller and Fonsia,
rendezvous to play gin and talk.

The Gin Game is a play about friend-
ship; particularly the desperate
friendship of Weller and Fonsia who,
we learn, never receive any visitors.

”This is not a courtship play,"
Royston noted. ”The two characters
could have been the same sex and it
still would have worked, I think.

"It is genuinely about friendship.
I've found few shows that really
address that topic, and I think The Gin
Game is one of the strongest."

Royston even ventured to say that

:_Hayfever'

 

the show could have been removed
from its setting in the old age home
and still completed its portrait of a
relationship. That hasn't been
attempted‘, however, and thus, The
Gin Game continues to functiongas a

..

play that requires its audience to con-
sider the social questions of older
people living in these environments.

In his research, Royston found

three constants in such homes for the
aged.

First, board and card games, like
gin, are readily available and fre-
quently played. Second, particularly
among the men, there is strong
attention to baseball games. Third,
there is an omnipresent television

To add a Pittsburgh touchto the
play which is not set in any particular

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
   

city, Weller will wear a Pirates base-
ball cap, circa 1950. Also, a television
set will drone on-stage, tuned in to a
local television station.

Bingo O’Mally, a veteran of the
Pittsburgh stage and a familiar face in
Lab productions, will portray Weller.
Nann Mogg, a newcomer here, will
play Fonsia.

The Gin Game will run Sept. 30
through Nov. 6.

Comedy Has More Snooze ThanSneeze

By BURTON WHITE

i Noel Coward's comedies of the '20s
and ‘.305 were once praised with the
ability to ”pass foam off for cham-
pagne,” to retain enough of their
original flavor to captivate a contem-
porary audience. Much of this flavor

is attributed to Coward's dialogue

style which exposes the pretense, epi-
gramatic charm and gaming of Bri-
tain’s ”Mayfair set." Language,
rather than extensive plot or action,
becomes an entertainment in itself
and is necessary to convey the dra-
matic action.

The current production of Hayfever,
at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre,
does show ‘B great deal of sparkle at
first glance (much more than a "shoe—
string budget" would seemingly
allow). The set and costumes by Cle-
tus Anderson, splendid in their
design and construction, provide the
arena as we are introduced to Sorel

and Simon Bliss, the grown but emo-
tionally crippled childrene of-Judith
and David. Immediately, the Bliss'are

confronted with an untenable situa— r

tion: they mutually realize they have
all invited guests for the ‘weekend.
The remainder of the play is the 24
hour chronicle of the Bliss’ and their
attempts at dealing with each other
and their relatively ’’common'' house-
guests. It is in re-telling that this pro-
duction becomes diluted and goes
flat.

Judith (Patricia Roe), a retired and
aging diva of the stage, comes off as a
Nora Desmond clone with little or no
character emerging. David (Alan
Mixon), her novelist husband, fol-
lows suit by being incorrigibly affable
and bland. Sorel (Donna Snow), an
ingenue given to histronics, remains
hysterically flippant throughout,
while Simon (John Shuman) mean-
ders from being a lonely heart to dad-

teases us into listening to her story
while Mr. Southern-gallantly enter-
tains us with his comfortable style. A
notable performance is given by Eli-
sabeth Orion in the role of the Bliss’
maid, Clara. Orion’s Command of the
stage and understanding of the sub-
tlety of subtexted humor makes her
one of the evening's saving graces,
Directorily, this production suffers
from the dilution of Coward's rhetor-
ical humor with shticlc...and a lot of it.
Scenes where the characters have the
opportunity for confrontation are
muddled, drawing focus away from
dialogue to some extemporanegug, bit
of business and leaving it to find its
own way back. Sorel cannot carry on
a discourse without standing on fur-
niture and throwing pill()wr3_ Simon

action with a tiresome hyena laugh.
His actions become anticipated and
indicative. Jackie (Laurie Klatscher), a
flapper, does’ little more than
whimper onstage, and when she does
do more, it takjes the form of a long
shrill cry that would make any fire
station proud. In a play already
deemed by Coward "far and away one
of the most difficult plays to be per-
formed," Shapiro fails to present us
with the contrasts inherent in each
character. In equating all of the char-
acters’ follies, his actors never seem
serious about the points of view they

try to make -—— they appear stagnant.

I don't know if there is a "purist"
movement in the Coward camps, but
I do believe that the flavor of the play-
wright is most readily realized
through emphasis on character and
dialogue. It is this flavor, not the
unpalatable production at PPT, that
will sustain revivals of Coward come-
dies in the future.

Boystown
TMI

For those who may not
remember, Pittsburgh was once
a fertile field of growing musical
diversity. There were bands like
The Puke, whose punk philo-
sophy led them to do things like
rip up Bibles onstage — preten-
tious, but at least it was exciting
at the moment. The Rave-Ups
sang songs about Easter bun-
nies and left for California and
all things glamorous and shiny.
Made In Pittsburgh, Vol. III had the
best of the lot on it — groups
like The Swarm, The Hipsters,
The Downtowners, The Rum-
hounds and The Whereabouts

record in years. Everyone is into
"dance music,” ”new music,”
"rap music." Call it what you
want, "the beat” is still there.
Madonna says, give her four!
four count and the throwaway
forgettable lyrics, and she'll
make it work — and does she
ever, on her first, self-titled
album.

She doesn't care how her
songs are categorized, as long as
you get up and dance to it. As
she cries (litl rally) on ”Every-
body,": ”...get up and do your
thing....everybody get up and
dance and sing...." Simple
catchy lyrics and truly words to
live by. Her vocals go from one
extreme to the other; pleading
cries to commanding domina-
trix The same thing goes on
"Physical Attraction” (another
former single) and the rest of
the songs on this album; the lyr-

the verses and the musical
breaks linger on. There's an
effective inter-play between her
unusual vocal stylings and the
electronic synthesizers with
washboard sound effects slap-
ping the bass-line. There's no
subtlety at all; the commanding
beat embraces and drives
Madonna's authoritative vocals
to heighten the excitement on
every song.

The current single, ”Holi-

urgent clamorous effects that
the other songs have. As she
restrains herself and gives a
rather nonchalant delivery to

virtual hotbed of rock and roll.
Gradually, all of the aforemen-
tioned bands dissolved, for rea-
sons that lie somewhere
between fatigue, money or dis-
gust from playing their brains
out and never getting ahead.
Only two groups from the old
days are still together — The
Five and Carsickness. But,
whereas, a few years ago, ever-
yone seemed filled with hope
and/or enthusiasm, today's local
music scene seems to have a
melancholy mood attached to it,-
too many really fine bands from
here didn't ”make it" in any
sense of the word, so why
bother?

Well, thank God some people
still do bother. Boystown, to be

It's only when Madonna
starts those girlish pleas to

get the most enjoyment out of
this album. Most of the songs
here have already received
extensive radio and club play
and continue to command more
listeners to get up and impound

floors. Five years ago, this
would have been considered a
"disco" album — it still is.

RUEL NICHOLAS
 
THE CROSSING
Big Country
Polygram

Pilgrim Rock. That's the
sound of Big Country, a band of
Scotsmen who've gone back to
the guitar as if it ‘were the only
instrument that ever mattered.
These guys have a style that's as
massive as their name suggests
and a debut album that burns
like nothing else this side of the
moors.

Big Country is the soulchild
of Stuart Adamson, who, ever
since his days with the Skids,
has believed in using the guitar
as an orchestral element of
songwriting — much the same
way that Glenn Branca designs
his six-string symphonics. The
Crossing turns Adamson’s con-
victions into chord structure as
it employs texture upon texture
of guitar rhythm and melody to
expand each album cut into a
panorama of sound.

The effect is a stunning col-
lection of 10 songs that has the
urgency of The Edge's three-
string blitz and the fervor of a

MEG COUNTRY

exact; and while most of us are
too jaded to think that someone
other than the Houserockers
might have a shot at the big-
time (and they've failed, haven't
they.7), this record might make
you think otherwise. Though
it's only a four-song EP, Boys-
town came through loud and
clear with style and substance.
Rebecca Bellamy, lead vocal-
ist, has a voice that fits the mod-
ern woman; it's not pretty in the
conventional sense. It says that
the woman singing has her eyes
wide open; it's loud and brash at
times, smokey and subtle at oth-
ers, but it lets the listener know
that the singer is her own per-
son -—— it's commanding with a
personality of its own. The titles
of the songs clue you in on this

Scottish jig. Moreover, Big
Country's generous use of the
E-Bow thickens the album's
Highland accent with a bagpipe
sound and creates a misty set-
ting for Adamson’s folksy
songwriting.

Adamson’s thick Scottish wail
also adds the right amount of
pathos to his typically agrarian
lyrics. Songs like "The Storm,"
”Porrohman" and "Close
Action” dwell on themes of
hardship and struggle on the
moorlands, while cuts like
"Fields Of Fire” and "In A Big
Country” grasp for hope amidst
lines of melancholia.

Steve Lilywhite has a field day
producing this band. His fasci-
nation with the hazy wall-of-

NMO.I.S A081

distinction: "No Promises,”
"Can You Say," ”Shattered Illu-
sions” and ”Tender Trap.” So
many '80s bands have a female
singer who seems to be there
:)nly for her gender appeal, but
this isn't the case with Boys-
town. Besides singing, Bellamy
plays guitar and mellotron here,
as well as co-writing all of the
material with guitarist Rick
Pegg.

The songs themselves suffer
a bit in the lyric department -
there’s nothing that's really
worth putting into quotations
—— but the overall mood is one of
pessimism, they speak of love
but not naivete. Though the
record's "low—budget" sound (it
was recorded in Ambler, Pa.,
wherever that might be) limits
its full potential at times, the
excellent musicianship can't be
denied. Guitars, bass,keyboards
and drums are woven in and out
of one another, never giving
way to the muddy sound that
often results; here, it's lively
and melodic — sensual, if you
will. This, combined with Bel-
lamy's vocals and stance, makes
for an unquestionably appealing
texture.

It's doubtful that Boystown
will ever be as big as, say, The
Pretenders, but they are oneof
the bands that's breathing fresh
air into this faded town's music
turf. And, if they can accomp-
lish that difficult task, who
knows? Maybe, just may-
be...even Cynics have hopes.

LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

sound suits Big Country's style
quite well and helps them attain
that larger-than-the-speakers
intensity. For once, the pro-
ducer matches the band.

Big Country is an invigorat-

ing break from the glitzy drone’

of most of today's techno-pop.
This band combines a new style
of guitar arrangements with the
traditionalism of Scottish folk
music that's easy to listen to and
quick to addict. The Crossing
manages to find an uncharted
region in a mapped-out music
industry and establishes Big
Country as one of the new pil-
grims of rock—n-roll.

TRUE
Spandau Ballet

Chrysalis

A group with a name like
Spandau Ballet shouldn't sound
like the group that is Spandau
Ballet. Somehow. Shouldn't
their music be prohibitively
c_ivant—garde, the newest of new
waves? Instead, Spandau Ballet
are clean-cut boys, five of them,
and they might have taken a poll
to find out what makes a suc-
cessful pop album, combined
the results and then applied
them to True, their latest. Leav-
ing nothing to chance, the
album's inner sleeve offers ”all
our love to our Mums and
Dads.” Anyway, their eight-
song collection is one of the
most instantly likeable to filter
through the stereo system in a
long time.

Therein lies its weakness;
such immediate affinity is sus-
pect, and the listener starts
looking for why. Lead guitarist
Gary Kemp wrote all the songs
— strong numbers, laden with
hooks and ”meaningful" lyrics.
Martin Kemp on bass, John
Keeble on drums and Steve
Norman on sax and percussion
perform the material with slick
and smug precision; there's not

a guitar riff or percussive tap-

   

 

tap or taste of backing vocal
that's the Least bit out of place.
The resulting clean, layered
sound balances the equally
effective lead vocals from Tony
Hadley.

Hadley’s powerful ‘and
expressive singing seems
anachronistic; it belongs to
another era, perhaps the 19505,
when Vic Damone and Tony
Martin were vogue. Hadley’s
delivery is similarly straightfor-
ward and polished — but like
the rest of the music, possibly-
too effortless. With calculated
perfection, True re-emphasizes
strong, upbeat pop music. Is
that wrong? Of course not.
Don't feel guilty if you fall into
its trap.

The material sounds, well,
good — eight potential hit sin-
gles fill the grooves of True, and
the title cut has already worked

its way into the Top 40. Gary
Kemp's lyrics are of the
adolescents-in-love variety;
”Pleasure" tells of ”adventures
at 19, I'm searching/l am search-
ing in my heart.” The heroine of
"Heaven is a Secret" will ”sing a
’West-Side’ song/you could be
the boy in the film.” ”Code of
Love” explains that "when love
comes along, it's just a Catcher in
the Rye.” ”Foundation" makes a U,
nice dance tune; ”Communica- "5
tion" is a good number also, and 2
so is ”Gold," and don't forget <2
”Lifeline."Catchy stuff, all of it. 2
Spandau Ballet reaches the 5
end of side two — the closing D
strains of the title ballad — with
not a hair disturbed. True is an
accomplishment, achieving

lively accessibility within a safe
and severely limiting formula.

RICHARD SATER

ROSS
Diana Ross
RCA

Diana Ross owes us an apol-
ogy. Her latest self-titled album,
Ross, finds her working with
some solid talent (as usual), but
the results just aren't very
invigorating. As a matter of

  

fact, Ross is a surprisingly cold
and boring album.

Last year's Silk Electric left
Diana Ross fans with an ultra-
slick single (”Muscles”), a beau-
tiful ballad (”Still In Love") and
even a powderpuff rock number
(”Fool For Your Love"). Ross not
only fails to pick up where the
inventiveness of Silk Electric left
off, but it seems to cast a strain
on Ross’ overall talent. Not even
superstar status could drag the
mediocre single ”Pieces Of Ice"
any higher than the low 30s on
the singles charts.

Side one begins with two of
the worst songs on the disc,
”That’s How You Start Over"
and ”Love Will Make It Right."
Both are songs that a singer like
Laura Branigan could belt out
more convincingly while having
teeth pulled, yet Ross’ tone of
voice has given them an edge of

  J.El'l'lV8 nvcmvas.

‘unecessary co ness. nsie ‘ '

two, we're offered two of the
more upbeat songs — collabora-
tions with Ray Parker Jr. called
”Love or Lonliness” and "Up
Front" — but even with Parker's
backup guitar, the songs lack
motivation.

Much of the blame should go
toward whomever selected the
material for Ross. The listless

lli

  

C 1v sogs don't belong here —-

they belong on a Captain and
Tennille album. The rest of the
blame is on Diana. The. voice
that once could melt an igloo in
Alaska with one breath seems
reduced to dealing with mere
pieces of ice.

The Drum

THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL
By John Le Carre
Alfred A. Knopf

John Le Carre's The Little Drummer
Girl is a confusing book. It isn't just
the Israeli-Zionist movement versus
the Palestinian faction confusion, but
also the multiple names used for the
agents. A person needs a scorecard to
keep all of the names straight. James
Bond is known by name and number,
but you can always tell who he is.
These characters change name and
nationality so frequently that, well, it
is confusing.

The novel is written is such detail
that it seems to actually put you
there. Israeli is against Palestinian
and you get to know both sides all too
well. But there is too much bloodshed
and merciless killing for you to side
with either.

The book opens with a bomb scene,
starting with a blast, so to speak
(excuse the pun, but the scene grabs
your attention and, fortunately,
holds it). You must read on to find out
that this bombing and these victims
are not the main characters — only
casualities on the long list of people
that the book goes through.

The little drummer girl is an Eng-
lish actress named Charlie (also

 

  
   

L. _,.. ._. __.—-—.

Palme). The Israelis want her to use
herself as a pawn in the huge deceiv-
ing game which is as intricate as
chess. ’

Charlie lies about everything. How
can she be trusted with such a major
operation when the Israelis know she
ies? Somewhere along the line, her
loyalties change, and she is persuaded
to play a part in the scheme of trap-
ping the Palestinian terrorist who is
the head rebel. Charlie must pretend
that she has been intimate with the
rebel’s brother Michel in order to get

 

I EC RRE
out for Charlie with the help of Gadi
Becker (also known as Joseph), an
Israeli officer. She is so well-trained
(and her mind so twisted) that she
actually comes to believe that Michel
was a part of her-life and that she
must punish the Israelis for their part

at the rebel‘. The ”courtship" is laid

The book’ has definite high points
and, on the whole, makes fine read-
ing. It is easy to understand how it
was one of the summer's best sellers.
If you enjoy thrillers in the genre of
The Spy Who Came in From The Cold,

Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smileys
People, also by Le Carre, then by all
means, read this book. Just make sure
you have a chart and pencil nearby.

0t Detectives 8: Men

DANCING BEAR
By James Crumley
Random House

The American private-eye novel
has, for a number of years, been in a
state of complete stasis, like the west-
ern. This is a sad thing because there
is much that a writer has yet to
attempt, working both within and
building upon the conventions of the

genre. A new private-eye novel is

without exception promoted as ”the
legitimate successor to Hammett,
Chandler and MacDonald." This is
frequently untrue, and even if true, a
little depressing. Where is the hard-
boiled detective who is more than an
excuse for a hackneyed plot and an
excess of nostalgic references to dox-
ies, Sam Spade and the days when
men wore hats? He is here: Milton
Chester Milodragovitch III, the pro-
tagonist of James Crumley’s latest
novel, Dancing Bear.

Dancing Bear is primarily a novel, a
very good novel, about a 46-year-old
man who finds himself finally and

an odd way, it is almost incidental
that the man, faced at long last with
some irrevocable decisions, is a pri-

”Milo" to his friends, has lived too
long, done too little, seen too much.
The novel opens, as the genre dic-
tates, with the detective temporarily
unemployed. Milo’s own agency
closed some years before, and he
spends his days and nights doing two-
bit security work for a local company,
with long, ragged interludes of pep-
permint schnapps (to keep off the‘.
harder stuff) and cocaine. His only
goal in life is to live to the age of 52,
when he will finally inherit the
money left him by his father years
before, which his mother had legally
prevented him from getting until this
late age in the hope, ironically, that he
would not waste his life. Yet this is
precisely what he has done, serving

briefly in Korea, even more briefly in ‘

the local Meriwether, Montana,
police force, then engaging in his
irregular profession of detective. His
only qualifications for this profession
may be a grudging familiarity with
guns and a razor-sharp eye for
human character. He is not intrepid,
not moral; he is not even very ”cool."
He is, in short, an average man,
slightly degenerate, who finds him-
self in over his head, almost for the
last time, devastatingly.

Booming

pffense In

Panthers’
Way

By CHARLIE O'HARA

M Qt Having enjoyed their week off to

prepare for Maryland, the unde-
feated Pitt football team must be
ready to stop one of the most potent
offensive attacks in the nation.

Quarterback Boomer Esiason,
though he is battling a bruised
shoulder, heads the Terp offense
which is averaging 411.5 yards per
game after its first two contests
against two stingy defenses in West
Virginia and Vanderbilt.

The 1-1 Terrapins are capable of
solving almost any defense.

“A lot can be said about Boomer,
but you can‘t overlook their running
game," Panther defensive back

coach Dino Folino said. “They
have three or tour very good running
backs.”

“They’re all averaging around
four or five yards a carry. They run a
lot of power running plays. We will
have to stop a very sound running
game.”

Their two-game statistical total
lists two Maryland running backs
with over I00 yards rushing, sopho-
more Rick Badanjek and senior Wil-
lie Joyner, who rushed for over 1000
yards in I982. Senior Dave D'Addio
also provides punch to the running
game as he has been averaging over
four yards per carry.

Obviously, Maryland does have a
running game.

The passing attack, though, is
where most of the opponents’ inter-
est lies. They have several persons
who can break a game open.

Esiason, to name one, bailed the
Terrapins out at Nashville in their
season opening come-from-behind
victory over Vanderbilt, 2l-l4.

“Boomer is like a left-handed
Matt Cavanaugh,-” _Foge Fazio said.
“He's big and has a strong arm."

Two weeks ago, the Panthers were
successful in stopping one of the
nation's better quarterbacks in Tim
Riordan of Temple, but Esiason is

g ‘ much more than Riordan.

“I think he's a lot better than Rior-
dan,” Fazio said. “He also has good
receivers.”

“He's as good a quarterback as we
have faced in a couple years,“ Folino
said.

3Y MIKE SIBERINI

»_When talking to members of the
Pitt soccer team about the Panthers‘
defensive corps, one word keeps
P°PPl118 up — hustle.

“Hustle typifies our defenders and
has kept us in the games we've won,”
head coach Leo Bemis said. “Now,
th?Y'V§ started to develop some
Pride in their work.

“H”ustlc, that's what we do the
best. left fullback Andy Adelmann
added. “Hustling is kind of our
trademark."

Along with Adelmann, others
Wh0_have hustled their way into the
Starting lineup include stopper Brian

Sex. sweeper Uzumah Chibundu
‘"151 right fullback Jim Steele.

Currently, Jamie Katzin is the
team's fifth defender and the odd
man out in coach Leo Bemis’ 4-3-3
(four defenders-three midfielders-
three forwards) system. Katzin, who
was a starter for most of last season
and the first two games of I983 at
left fullback, missed a few games due

to illness and lost his job to Adel-
mann. For Bemis, this presents the
problem of too many quality play-
ers. This is a problem most coaches
would love to have.

Adelmann was more of an offen-
sive player when he arrived at Pitt
from Notre Dame of East Strouds-
burg High School last year. He saw
only spot action in 1982 and began
to work more on his defensive skills
over the winter.

“Last winter, the guys got a team
together out at Sewickley [Indoor
Fitness Center], and Andy got to
playing defense,” Bemis said. “He
got into that game, and I even used

him on defense in some indoor tour-
naments. He turned out to be one of
our better defenders indoors."
Adelmann continued to work on
his skills this past summer and when

Katzin was sidelined, he stepped in
and has impressed Bemis during the
team's current four-game winning
streak.

Casey has been a two-year starter
at stopper, a position where he's
consistently marking the other
team's top scoring threat.

“Brian has just been a fixture at
stopper. for his two years," Bemis
said. “The only games he has missed
was after he got hurt last year
against. Bucknell, and he missed a
couple games. I think he's done a
good job. an excellent job.“

“He's improved a lot from last
year,” Katzin added. “He's really
tough, one of the toughest stoppers
lye ever seen."

And while assessing his own tal-
ents, Casey believes that his strong
point is man-to-man marking. the
most essential skill needed to
become a successful stopper back.

Nigerian-born Uzumah Chi-
bundu is the team's sweeper, the
trailer on defense.

Bring out those facial grocery
bags. Yes, I am so embarrassed.
Last week's picks were undes-
cribable. A 45 rcent rate can
only make it for high school
quarterback.

There was one saving grace. I
was correct on the tie between
Arizona State and UCLA. No
one has ever done that before.
The potential is there, but I just
got to get loosened up.

   

Viewpoint

Anyway, I am ready for the
major comeback. No more medi-
ocre weeks for this prognostica-
tor. Here are this week's picks.

Pitt at Maryland — Nice game
to start off with, is it not? The
Panthers are heading into the
meat-grinder part of their ache-
dule, one which will tell if they
are a Top 20 team or not.

Maryland has one of the best
quarterbacks in the nation in
Boomer Esaison, but he is hurt-
ing. Pitt's defense has met big
challenges before, and this
should be no exception. Pitt 24,
Maryland 22

West Virginia at Boston Col-
lege —- A duel between the
Mountaineers‘ Jeff Hosteler and
the Golden Eagles‘ Doug Flutie,
not only the two best quarter-
backs in the East, but among the
elite in the nation. Even though
Flutie is recovering from a con-
cussion, the footballs should be
flying in the crisp New England
air.

One should be convinced that
West Virginia is deserving of its
spot in the polls; a comeback win
against Maryland is nothing to
overlook. West Virginia 33, Bos-
ton College 29

Temple at Penn State — Even
with three straight losses, the
Lions are still in a class above the
Owls. Then again, Cincinnati is
not a national powerhouse.

Still, Penn State will not make
it four in a row, even though Joe
Paterno has some serious prob-
lems with the team. Ifsuch a mir-
acle would happen, the suicide
rate may double at Happy Val-
ley. Penn State 28, Temple I3

Georgia Tech at Clemson -- If
Georgia can do no better than tie
the Tigers in Orange Paw land,

the Yellow Jackets are not likely ~ :1

to leave South Carolina with a
victory. Clemson 2!, Georgia
Tech l0

Tulane at Kentucky -— Pre-
dicting this game will depend on '
the status of Green Wave Jon
English, who is challenging the;
NCAA'transfer rule. The courts
will give an injunction to Eng-’
lish, and this will spur the Wave
on. Tulane 27, Kentucky 23

Auburn at Tennessee —— The
Vols are not a real good football
team. That was proven when Pitt
beat them in Knoxville without
getting a first down until the
third quarter. Auburn should be .
recovered from the Texas defeat.
Auburn 23, Tennessee [7

And now, the National Foot-
ball League games on Sunday.
Pittsburgh 23, New England 2|;
New York Jets 30, Los Angeles 9;
Detroit 24, Minnesota 20; San
Diego 33, Cleveland 27; Seattle
26, Washington 21.

Last week’s record 9-ll .450.

BY MARK A. SINDLER

Lady Panther volleyball coach
Shelton Collier is ﬁnding out about
his squad’s intricacies each day.
Soon, though, there will not be any-
thing intricate about it should recent
trends prove conclusive. )1

_» The latest trend to hit Collier is
injuries. So much so that his roster
has been whittled down to seven
players. Or about one extra in addi-
tion to those who start. Team depth
has all but disappeared.

Three days ago, the trend gained
strength when junior outside hitter
Pat Belcher happened upon advice
from her private physician that she
not participate in the West Virginia
Classic. scheduled to begin tonight.

Advice nothing. The doc ordered
elcher to play spectator tonight
and tomorrow after playing in every
game and for every point in 1351
weekend’s Pitt Classic.

Source for concern here is her
right knee and the surgery per-
formed on it during the offseasorg
Apparently, the summertime layoff
was not long enough.

Add to this latest . “injured-
reserve" log the two sidelinings of
Collier's setters, juniors Judy Young
and Cathy Rupp. ‘ The former
sprained her left ankle two weeks
ago and is not expected to hit the
hardwoods until the Purdue Classic
in two weeks.

Rupp, with a more severe sprain,
presents a different story. The Ohio
U. transfer may be out‘for at least a
month.

Seemingly, the sap is rapidly
draining from the tree Collier calls
his roster. Dealing with itzcalls for
innovations of sorts. One is shifting
sophomore Sally Gillespie from her
backcourt latitude to replace Young
and Rupp.

turns of events act as potholes down
the road.

“It leaves us with no strategic
moves whatsoever,“ Collier said of
nonexistent options in place nf hav-
ing Gillespie set a 3-1.

“The classic for us would have
been for Sally to go in partway
through the match to fire the team
up and push us through. Now there
is no power boost. Now we must set
a 5-1 whether it works or not.

“There are no other options.”

To adjust quickly to her new
responsibilities, Gillespie has lately
been seeing more practice time. The
same can be said of freshman Kris
Wexell. The Norwin grad will be
playing right outside hitter through-
out the WVU tournament.

Collier is also utilizing her talents
in a novel pass-reception setup.

“The new alignment uses her to do
basically something no other team
does in the country,” he continued.

“She will serve and receive on all six
rotations.”

On Wexell‘s opposite antenna will
be Regina Reyes, a sophomore start-
ing for the first time ever. Collier
wrote her in after hearing news of
Belcher’s prognosis. Wexell would
_have started on the left, Belcher in
the spot Wexell is playing starting
tonight.

The only formidable unit in Colli-
er’s chart is middle hitting/ blocking.
Junior Ulana Kohutiak and sopho-
more Carmen Tapia are regulars
who know their area like a barber
knows his snipping implements-

The final slot on the court will be
filled by freshman Sue Hoover,
expected to play opposite Gillespie
at right side hitting.

How this formation leaves room
for Pitt capturing‘ its fourth consecu-
tive tournament victory this season

All are expectedly healthy. That
leaves Collier expectedly
apprehensive.

“The thing I’m aware of is more
players on Ohio’s roster," he added.(
“That means they will have more
depth and make more strategic
moves. It gives them advantage to
play better in long matches.”

The argument is not convincing,
though.

“They have probably more solid
volleyball players, but our starters
are better than theirs. It depends on
how well we play, depending on how
well our players play up to par.”

Pitt will find that out tomorro.

continued from page ﬁfteen,
Chibundu played mostly stopper
in his native land, but since Pitt
already had Casey, they shifted him
to sweeper back, a position that

requires one to pick up loose balls
and initiate offensive thrusts from
the back line.

When he was with the Panthers
last year, Bemis started him at for-
ward. Forced to leave the team in the
middle of the season for personal
reasons, Chibundu returned late in
the season to a wing back position.

Noticing that the outside fullback
position wasn't for him, Bemis
moved Chibundu to sweeper for the
current campaign.

Steele, like Adelmann, started his
career as an offensive player.
Slowly, though, Bemis moved him

into a midfield spot at the beginning
of last season and to right fullback
toward the end.

face of declining resources.

Panelists:

“We needed to strengthen our
outside back position," Bemis
explained. “He's a tough guy, and
he‘s got speed. And being a forward,

he knew how forwards play. For-
wards who are good athletes, that
are willing to do it, make good
backs."

One of Steele’s calling cards is his
aggressive style of play.

“He‘s pretty tough," Adelmann
said. “He doesn’t let many players
get beyond him.”

“Overall; the defense is tough.
We‘re just really solid,” Katzin said.
“If someone gets beat, then Zuma
(Chibundu) is back covering."

“We’re hustling and recovering
much better than last year," Casey
added.

The defenders, and indeed the rest
of the Panthers (4-2), will have a
tough assignment as they hit the
road to face Gannon (5-2) Saturday

Plttl Running Attack Key Against Maryland

continued from page ﬁfteen

The corps of receivers is impres-
sive, too. Wide outs Greg Hill and
Russell Davis can do quite a few
things if Boomer is able to get the
ball to them.

“Greg Hill is their deep threat,”
Folino said. “He can catch the ball
and has excellent speed."

“Russell Davis is a big receiver
[6-5, 215 lbs.],” Folino said. “When
he catches the balL he won’t go down
without a fight. You usually need
two guys to get him down.”

At the tight end position, there are
two who substitute for each other
throughout the game. Juniors Ron
Fazio [6-4, 230 lbs.] and Bill Rogers
[6-3, 240 lbs.] share the
responsibility.

“In my opinion, Bill Rogers is the
better of the two,” Folino said. “ e

game-winning touchdown against
Vanderbilt.”

The Maryland defensive scheme is
the “wide tackle six" which has been
a Maryland tradition prior to the
l982 arrival of head coach Bobby
Ross.

“They play a very active defense,”
Folino said. “Their base defense [the
wide tackle six] is different from
what we have seen each week.
They're very strong inside on
defense.”

The Panther combatants will have
to be out in full force. Ifthey are able
to establish a running game, the
John Congemi pass offense could
stand a good chance as was made
evident by West Virginia and Jeff
Hostetler during theirﬂsecond half
surge last Saturday.

The Panther running game, which
appeared for the first time this sea-

\4 v“\4

"~—4 \< \d \\-4 ‘\\-G K.“ \‘

son against Temple, was impressive,
but it was Temple.

With Mike Dahl, the injury-prone
Panther offensive lineman, ready to
play, the Panther running attack
should be well stocked across the
offensive line.

“Mike Dahl looks like he will play
a lot on Saturday," Fazio said. “We
been quite pleased with the way that
the practice sessions have gone over
the past two weeks.”

“We should be two men deep at all
the offensive line positions.“

In the backfield, Darnell Stone
appears to be the man to whom Foge
Fazio is looking.

“Darnell continues to impress the
coaches," Fazio said. “He is looking
more each day as if he is going to
become a permanent fixture back
there."

incognito since his arrival in Oak-.
land at the beginning of the semes-
ter, is receiving quite a bit of
attention from the coaches in the
first month of his frosh campaign.

“We like the way he runs the ball,”
Fazio said ofthe 5-! l, 182 lb. Shady-
side Academy graduate. “He seems
to know when to make the cut. He’s
a smart kid.”

Look for Scales to strut his stuff
as early as tomorrow.

To beat the wide tackle six, the
Panthers will need the balance that
they achieved against Temple. The
biggest aspect in doubt may well be
whether the Panthers can step up to
a Maryland caliber defense from a
Temple.

Consistency is what makes the
good teams. Tomorrow afternoon,
the Panthers must begin to build
consistency against good teams.

PITT/MARYLAND BITS:Pitt
leads the series 2-0-0. In their last
meeting in 1980, then-Panther quar-
terback Dan Marino passed for 282
yards and three touchdowns as Pitt
stomped the Terps, 38-9....NCAA

statistics have Pitt second in total
defense, allowing l97.0 yards per
game, first in scoring defense, [.5
points per game, 10th in rushing

defense, 81.0 yards per game, and¢_

13th in pass defense allowing 1 l6 per
game....Pitt has not lost a game fol-
lowing a week off since l977....The
Panther defense has allowed only
three touchdowns in its last 24 quar-

ters of action....Pitt has come out
victorious in six of its last eight
games with Atlantic Coast confer-
ence teams.

Injuries 

Draln
Roster

continued from page sixteen

It does not help any that Mary-
land will be part of the struggle to
keep match games at a minimum.

“We would still go in the favorite,
but we have to prove it,” Collier
said, belabored by those injuries.
“Maryland has always given Pitt
problems. It’s always a knock-down,
drag-out type thing whenever we
meet up.”

The two schools last met in I981 

when Pitt defeated the Lady Terrap-
ins in the semifinals of the now-
defunct AIAW Eastern Regional
Championships held at Pitt.

In a jolt of surprise, Collier said
his healthy players may indeed be
more concerned with such matters
as Maryland defeats than, say, dis-
placements of their teammates.

“The team is not at all dwelling on
injuries,” Collier said. “Sally is
doing a great job of carrying the
team at setting. We're trying not to
focus on finjuriesl.”

No doubt, Collier will attempt to
set his sights on reversing trends of
the kind that are so far ominous.
GAME SERVES: Pitt will look to
launch another streak as it puts a
12-1 record on the line this week-
end....Its first match loss this season
came Sunday against Penn State
....The Lady Lions are one of several
teams picked by Volleyball Monthly
to reach the NCAA‘s Final Four in
mid-December....Included in that
list are Pitt, Purdue, Northwestern
and Nebraska — all schools the
magazine sees as favorites to
advance from the NCAA’s Mideast
region.
