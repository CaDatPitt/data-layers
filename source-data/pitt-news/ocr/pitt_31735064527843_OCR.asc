SGB will not support
' faculty unionization

By Tammy Stradley
Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
will not support the unionization
of Pitt faculty, according to a
statement issued yesterday to the
university community.

The union issue divides those
concerned into three groups: the
administration, United Faculty of

‘ the University of Pittsburgh, and

Teachers for an Independent
Faculty.

SGB President Brent Saunders
said the SGB represents student
perspective and does not fully
support any of the groups.

The problem in examining this
issue, according to the SGB
statement, is that “both sides are
operating under different

definitions and discuss only
possibilities that neither can
confirm, deny or effectively
refute.

“Since we cannot expect one
side to persuade the other using
such arguments, we would like
to persuade both sides to consider
the students who attend the
University of Pittsburgh,” the
statement said.

The ballots to vote for or against
union representation will be
mailed to Pitt faculty on Feb. 15
by the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board. These ballots
must be received by the PLRB by
5 p.m. on March 7.

“Regardless of the outcome of
the vote,” the SGB said, “we feel
that the division created within

University reopens
probe into alleged

The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
announced that it will reopen a 2-
year-old investigation concerning
allegations of violations of NCAA
rules in the Pitt football program
following an investigative story
by a local newspaper.

“For the most part, the
information disclosed by [7739
Pittsburgh] Press is the same as
we had looked into earlier,” said
Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik.
“There is, however, some new
information and, apparently,
some individuals may have
changed their stories.”

The original investigation began
when Pittsburgh sports agent Gus
Sunseri told Bozik of possible

new campus policy

and Eric Hoch
Staff W1~iters

Smokers and non-smokers have mixed
‘feelings about Pitt's new smoking policy.

The policy, which went into effect on
Feb. 1, prohibits all smoking in academic
buildings and in university restaurants.

“I realize that my smoke can bother
other people, so that’s why I'm really not
upset about this new policy,” Janet
Carnahan, a smoker, said. “The policy
doesn’t bother me too much.”

Carnahan said that the recent mild
weather has made going outside to smoke
more convenient.

Joe Cillo, also a smoker, said that the
new policy doesn’t bother him either.

inside. I usually don’t smoke inside anyway,
and on days like this I’d be outside
smoking,” said Cillo.

Though the policy bans smoking in
private ofﬁces, appeals can be made to
have a closed—off area designated for
smokers. The room would have to be
approved by an environmental specialist.

“I think the policy is OK, but there
should be a designated area where all the
students can gather and smokers can
smoke. I don’t think that it’s fair to outlaw
smoking on the entire campus, and I don’t
think they can enforce it, especially in
private ofﬁces. But it really doesn't bother
me, since I know that smoking can bother
non-smokers," said Bobbie Crowe.

Dana Leitch, a non-smoker, approves of

the policy. “I think it's great, and I just
hope that it will be enforced,” said Leitch.

Leitch said it was an infringement on her
personal rights to have people smoke in
front of her.

“If they want to smoke, they should be
able to, but in designated areas only. If it
wasn't harmful to people, it wouldn’t be
such a big deal, but it is. I think that if
people want to smoke, they should have
a designated area away from non-smokers, ”
Leitch said.

Scott Young, also a non-smoker, is
entusiastic about the policy.

“I think that the policy is the best thing
that could have happened. It's not fair to
non-smokers to put up with smokers
smoking in public places,” said Young.

Young said smokers’ rights haven’t been

infringed upon, since they can always
smoke —-— just not around people who
prefer not to smoke.

“Smokers can always go outside or
smoke at home, but when they smoke
around non-smokers, they are infringing
on my rights,” said Young.

Some students objected to the inclusion
of dorm rooms in the smoking ban.

“I think the rule is fair in public buildings
and in restaurants, “ said senior Larry
Shuman. “The smoke in restaurants travels
to the non-smoking sections. That’s not
fair to non-smokers. But to tell people
they can't smoke in their own rooms is
very unfair.”

Senior Joe Sembrof said, “The no-
smoking policy in students’ rooms is an
invasion of privacy.”

Victims of hate crimes have some recourse

By Mark Smith
stay Writer

On Sept. 10, 1989, David
Piergalski was gay-bashed in
Schenley Park. He was beaten to
death by two teenagers. This anti-
gay-motivated murder in
Pittsburgh was but the latest in a
string of hate-motivated violence
in our country.

In Raleigh, N.C., Jim Loo, an
American of Chinese descent, was
murdered on July 31, 1990. Two
men severely beat 24-year-old
Loo with the butt of a gun because
they claimed that they didn't like
Orientals. The two broke glass
on the victim’s face.

Examples of other recent hate
crimes include pipe-wielding
skinheads in Laguna Beach, Calif.,
yelling “kill the faggot” while
they beat a gay man and
punctured his skull with the butt
of a hammer; anti-Semitic epithets
and “KKK” (Ku Klux Klan) spray.-
painted on a Jewish temple in
Falls»Church, Va.; and an African-
American church thatwas torched
in Macon, Miss.

Many levels of government are
considering crimes to be more
serious when the motives are
hate, prejudice and malice.

Question: Whatis the federal
government doing?
Answer: According to the
National Institute ofJustice’s 1987
report, “the most frequent victims
of hate violence today are blacks,
Hispanics, SoutheastAsians, Jews,

and gays and lesbians.
Homosexuals are probably the
most frequent victims.”

T o understand the effects of
hate crimes, Congress enacted
the Hate Crimes and Statistics Act
in the spring of 1990. The act
directs the Department of Justice
to collect and publish statistics
on crimes motivated by prejudice
on the basis of race, religion,
ethnicity or sexual orientation.
The Department ofJustice has set
up a toll-free hot line to report
hate crimes. If you experience
verbal abuse,’ harassment or
assault, in addition to contacting
the local police, call 1-800-347-
HATE. Anonymity will be
respected.

Q: Has Pennsylvania taken
action against hate crimes?

A: Yes. In 1982, the Ethnic
Intimidation and Institutional
Vandalism Act was passed.
However, the Pennsylvania law
only applies to crimes motivated
by prejudice regarding the race,
religion, color or national origin
of the individual. The act works

by increasing the penalties in
cases of harassment, terroristic
threats, assault and crimes against
property.

For example, if someone spray
paints a synagogue with “KKK,”
he or she could be charged with
criminal mischief and ethnic
intimidation, a separate charge.
The ethnic-intimidation charge
increases the criminal penalty. A
summary offense could be
upgraded to a third-degree
misdemeanor.

A 1990 amendment to the Ethnic
Intimidation Act allows the victims
to sue for civil damages.

Q: What about hate crimes
againstgaypeopleandwomen
in Pennsylvania?

A: Last year, lawmakers
attempted to amend the Ethnic
Intimidation Act to include anti-
gay, prejudice-motivated crimes
by adding sexual orientation to
the act. Anti-gay legislators
blocked the sexual- orientation
amendment.

Although crimes against

ISIS improves CGS
registration, billing

By Kim Checinski
For The Pitt News

Eighteen years ago, College of General Studies registration
specialistjoyce Davenport registered students by ﬂipping through
page after page of files, making phone calls to confirm course
availability and manually processing student bills. Each year the
line of waiting students grew longer, until about five years ago
when technology changed her job forever.

Computers invaded CGS The Integrated Student System, ISS,
solicited and pulled seats for students, but all paperwork had to
be sent to Thackeray Hall, and the registration process still wasn’t
going as quickly as possible. Crowds continued to pack the hall.

This academic year has been different, though. Equipped with
a new, more efficient computer network — Integrated Student
Information System (ISIS) — Davenport and other employees are
successfully fighting off the armies of students.

“I’ve totally forgotten what we used to do. I wouldn't dream of
going through all that now,” she said.

According to Davenport, ISIS accesses information faster and
. eliminates unnecessary searching, making CGS more of a “school
within a school.”

Staff specialist Bill Brooks added, “We’d been looking for a
more integrated system to make the school more independent.”

1990 registration period. Brooks said 28 computer terminals were
involved, and staff members spent weeks in training sessions.
Based on observation, student comments and staff suggestions,
the transition went smoothly, Brooks said

Minor glitches were reported, and several screen modifications
have been made. For example, ISIS was altered to accept the
override function. ’

“Its capabilities are still being explored and expanded,” Brooks
said.

The CGS registration center currently has access to all student
academic records.

Computer terminals display 17 to 20 different screens and are
on line with Student Accounts and Advising.

“We now have complete control of the registration process.
When you have more information at your hands, you have more
control of the situation,” Brooks said.

The situation at CGS is a sort of one-stop shopping. CGS
students can register at one location —— fourth floor of the
Cathedral of Learning— for any course offered by the university.
At registration, they are issued a printout of their current classes
and a full transcript on request. Brooks described this convenience
as “unique” and “easier on students and faculty.”

CGS is designed to accommodate a wide variety of students.
Sherry Miller Brown, Ph.D., director of registration, said she has

Lambs confirms Demme as an artist

By Matthew Myers
Staff‘ Wﬁter

A self—confessed cinephile,
director Jonathan Demme didn’t
develop a lifelong interest in film
until he was in college. In fact,
filmmaking was the furthest thing
from his mind. Enrolled in the
University of Florida’s School of
Veterinary Medicine, Demme was
apparently intent on being a horse
doctor. But when he began writing
movie reviews for the school
newspaper and the Coral Gable
Times, his extracurricular activities
soon changed the direction of his
career.

With The Silence of the Lambs,

his 12th motion picture, Demme ~

has emerged as a true American
auteur. In films like Melvin and
Howard, Stop Maleing Sense,
Something Wild and Married to
the Mob, Demme has shown the
distinct personal vision of a
director who craﬂs his pictures.
Unlike so many other directors,
he is not simply a gun for hire.
Rather, he is an artist who knows
exactly what he wants and how
to get it.

On the set of La mbs, Demme is
relaxed and cool, friendly and
commanding. He sits in his
director’s chair watching the video

monitor with intense
concentration, thanking the actors
after every take. Inside the dark
cell, Anthony Hopkins smiles at
Demme after the shot is over and

, prepares for his next scene. A

mask is lowered onto the Welsh
actor’s face, but the fit is too tight
——- Hopkins’ nose is squashed flat
by the heavy metal frame.

A technician asks Hopkins if
the mask is too tight. Demme
asks the actor if it’s possible to
endure the discomfort.

“Can you leave it? I like that. It
really articulates his predicament,”
says Demme.

Composing shot selections
nowadays is easy for Demme. He
doesn't have to look through the
camera’s viewfinder any more;
he just watches the wide—screen
video monitor. Although a
storyboard artist is credited in the
film, he prefers to use the shooting
script first. A

“I use the storyboards as sort of
a backup plan,” he says. “Usually,
I know pretty much how I want
a scene done, but if I feel a
particular quality of a scene or a
shot is absolutely necessary, then
we go from those drawings
directly. But otherwise, we work
from a shooting script, and the
artist makes sketches based on

those angles.”

There are other things that make
this picture luxurious for the
filmmaker. Indeed, it is a
remarkable contrast to Demme’s
earlier days, when he worked for
low-budget producer Roger
Corman. Demme’s first film, the
exploitative Caged Heat, was shot
for a minuscule $170,000 in 1974,
and went on to gross a few million
for Corman’s New World Pictures.

In Lambs, Demme pays
homage to his old mentor by
casting him as the head of the FBI

in his own $18 million film. And ,

now, Demme has the
considerable comfort of shooting
his movie in six months instead
of six weeks.

Lambs is also the second
attempt by Demme to make an
entry into the suspense genre.
His first, Last Embrace (1979),
starring Roy Scheider, fa red poorly
and was largely ignored by
audiences. With a bestseller
backing him with a built—in
moviegoing public, it looks as if
Demme will pull it off this time.

The war in the Persian Gulf threatens to
have disastrous effects on America’s future
relationship with the Middle East and
potentially with the world’s Islamic
population, according to one Pitt professor.

“I’m concerned [that] the long—term
consequences of this war will enhance
anti-Americanism on the part of the
Muslims and that anti-Islam [feelings] will

, rise in America, ” said Professor Dan Regan,

chairperson of the sociology department
and scholar of Islam.

According to Regan, one misconception
is that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
drawn support from Muslims throughout

’ the world because they think he is fighting

a war that portrays the Western world as
the primary enemy of the Muslim world.

Regan said response to Saddam has
been varied throughout much of the
Muslim world. According to Regan, there
is as much diversity within Islam as there
is within Christianity, leading to a diversity
of reactions to Saddam.

“Saddam Hussein and his Socialist
Baathist party lack credibility within the

Muslim world,” said Regan. “No ohe had
ever seen Saddam Hussein praying, but
suddenly he turns to Islam for legitimacy.”

Regan added that the secular leader has
never been accorded serious attention
among religious Muslims, and he
emphasized that the Iraqi leader has not
been successful in gaining the support of
the entire Muslim world.

Saddam has been effective in gaining
the support of many Muslims because
they see him as a genuine leader in the
Third World who has stood up to Western
imperialists, Regan said. “That resonates
in the hearts and minds of Muslims around
the world, including those who wouldn’t
normally support Saddam Hussein in other
cases,” said Regan.

Reasons for Third World support for
Hussein comes partly from disenchantment
with Western ideology and materialistic
values, Regan said. According to Regan,
Arabs account for 18 percent of the Islamic
population. Disappointment with native
elites who seemingly abandon Islam to
pursue goals perceived as Western is
another source of frustration, he said.

Leaders of countries such as Egypt and
Morocco, who have been outspoken critics

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, February 12, 1991

 
Gulf war tbreaterzs Americas relations with Islamzc world

of Saddam since the Aug. 2 invasion Of
Kuwait, have been forced to yield [0
strong public opinion and express support
for the Iraqi people. It is estimated that on
Feb, 3, 300,000 people held a pro-Iraqi
march in the streets of Morocco, a country
with 1,700 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.

Other countries such as Tunisia, Algeria,
Pakistan and Jordan that originally
expressed full support for the allied cause
have recently been calling for an early end
to the war in an effort to keep up with
public sentiment.

Muhammad Najjab, a Palestinian
originally from the West Bank who came
to the United States in 1952 as a student,
said that many Arabs have withdrawn
their support from the allied effort because
of the severity of the air attack on Iraq.

“When Iraq invaded Kuwait, it was
condemned by all the Arab people. When
the allies started the attack, the Arabs were
in a rage because of the plight of the Iraqi
people,” Najjab said.

“Arab men and women in the street are
extremely upset because when they look
at the media, all they see are bombs
dropping on innocent civilians,” he said.
“Refugees are telling stories that are

horrifying," Najjab added.

Regan cautioned that moderate
governments in countries with large Muslim
populations have been coming under

increased pressure from Islamic»

fundamentalists to take a more hostile
stand towards the West.

“Our war gives them an issue to mobilize
popular support for Islamic fundamentalists
against moderate Islamic rule. That is not
in America’s interests,” he said.

Regan said the war could destabilize the
moderate Muslim regimes throughout the
Third World and make the United States a
target for fundamentalist aggression. The
likelihood that the United States could
become an enemy of the fastest—growing
religion, whose members make up one-
fifth of the world’s population, would
pose significant problems for future
international relations. It could also increase
minority tensions within the United States,
he said. '

“The Arabs are facing a challenge of
change coming up to the 21st century. I

Saunders researched the recent
strike at Temple University before
the SGB issued the statement.
Temple professors were ordered
to teach by court injunctions, and
almost every student lost at least
one class.

Temple is the extreme of a
faculty strike, Saunders said, but
this possibility exists if Pitt faculty
unionizes.

“As students who are concerned

with the future of the University
of Pittsburgh, and in fact, our
own futures,” the statement said,
“we urge the faculty of the
university to vote ‘no
representation’ and to preserve
the possibilities and potential for
excellence of the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Kevin Novak, judicial- affairs
director for the College of General
Studies Student Government, said
the SGB statement does not
represent the CGS students’ views.
CGS has not taken an official
stand on the union issue.

Press night editor juggles teaching and newspaper work

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

For Jim White, almost every
weeknight at 7hePi'tt;shu7gh Press
starts out the same. He enters the
newsroom around 8:30 p.m., and
heads toward his yellow chair
while holding an early edition of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The next 15 minutes are spent
reading the newspaper and then
deciding whether The Pittsburgh
Press should cover the same
topics.

As night editor for the Press,
White is responsible for preparing
the layout of the first section of
the early-morning edition. The
next eight hours will be spent
probing the computer wire service
for stories making international
and national news.

“I usually try to leave by 4:30
a.m., but it all depends on’the
work,” says White.

Before turning on the news-
wire computer, he stretches his

arms and strolls to the advertising
department for the layout dummy.

On this particular Sunday night,
the newsroom is almost silent
except for the whistling of the
electric fans and the muttering of
a police radio.

Walking back to his desk, the
gray-haired, bearded White rolls
up his sleeves and waves to a
female reporter watering a plant.

“Most of the nights here are
probably the same,” says White.
“Sunday nights are usually quiet,
but if it gets busy, I usually don’t
take a‘ break. I might get a
sandwich and bring it back to my
desk.”

He switches on the news wire
and turns his attention for several
minutes to the Steelers game on
a large-screen television. Copy

' editor Todd Wetzler arrives and

sits at a desk across from White.

Wetzler has worked with White
for the last five years, editing
stories and sizing the photographs
to suit the layout.

They greet each other and begin
discussing an Associated Press
article on the news wire about
the high percentage of Norwegian
soccer players who have
sustained brain damage after years
of stopping soccer balls with their
heads.

“It is really a pleasure working
with Jim,” says Wetzler. “I
wouldn’t be here at nights if it
wasn’t for him.”

White looks up and grins.
“There is no salary raise if you say
all these nice things about me,”
he jokes.

Later in the night, the two men
discuss current stories, briefly
drawing Ed Osheskie, another
copy editor, into the conversation.

Osheskie returns to writing
headlines. While typing on the
computer, he occasionally stops
to take a break by pouring some
water from a container and
whirling around in his chair to
joke with White.

“I came to work here because

Jim was here,” laughs Osheskie,
who has worked side by side
with White for the last two years.
“He’s a great boss who knows
everything."

For White, knowing everything
is beneficial when he teaches an
introductory journalism class two
afternoons a week at the
University of Pittsburgh.

“I have done most of the things
I talk about in class; that includes
writing stories, interviewing and
knowing how a newspaper
works," White says. ,

White says he finds working as
an editor more exciting than
teaching at the university. A
colleague at the Press influenced
White to share his journalistic
knowledge with students.

“Teaching journalism is
interesting because it gives me a
chance to discuss journalistic
issues I don’t get to think about
under the pressures of my other
job,” he says.

A reporter politely interrupts

White to ask about the deadline
for an assignment on a homeless
woman. The reporter leaves the
newsroom in a hurry as another
city desk reporter walks slowly
into the brightly lit room with a
pillow and a large cup of coffee.

Meanwhile, White talks about
his journalism education, which
he received in the Army while
stationed in Germany. Over a
three-year period in the Army’s
public-relations department, he
wrote numerous articles praising
the accomplishments of soldiers
in his division for their hometown
newspapers.

After that, he received a job
with a local paper in West Wistery,
Mass., where he spent the next
six years learning feature writing
and layout.

White doesn’t remember when
he came to Pittsburgh or the
number of years he has worked
at The Press. “My guess is that I
have been here since the ’70s,”

WPIC installs telephone hotline to deal with Persian Gulf fears

By Andrew Bruno
For T be Pitt News

Western Psychiatric Institute 8:
Clinic has installed a hot line to
help people in the Pittsburgh
area deal with fears about the
war in the Persian Gulf.

According to Kathia Brenes,
media-relations coordinator at
WPIC, the hot line was started on
Jan. 22 and will continue as long
as needed.

“We’ve been getting a lot of
calls from the community
concerned about different issues
on the war,” Brenes said. “The
impact [the war] has had on

Western Psych has been from the
community—oriented sense.”

Many of the calls received are
from parents who are concerned
about how to explain the war to
their small children, according to
Brenes.

They want to know what effect
the media coverage will have on
their children.

Brenes said, “The bottom line
is that you have to go with what
age the child is. If they are older,
they can handle it.”

Other calls come from parents
who are afraid that their children
stationed in Saudi Arabia may
never come back. Therapists at

Hard Work, perseverance add up to Timm’s success

By Tonia Caruso
Staﬂ“ Writer

Ever since Mr. Kozlowski’s
fourth-grade math class, Neil
Timm knew he wanted to be a
math teacher. What the goal-
setting 9-year-old didn’t know
was how far his interest in
mathematics would take him.
Tim is now P_itt’s assistant vice
president for administration, data
administrator of the university
and director of the Office of
Management Information and
Policy Analysis.

So what exactly does Timm do?
The answer is a little complicated.

“I guess you could say Iwear
several hats around here, but in
many ways the jobs overlap,”
Tim said.

As data administrator, T im is
the information officer of the
university. He is responsible for
all data bases associated with the

U'university’s computer systems.

Timm not only oversees the data
but determines who can have
access to each system.

The data Timm coordinates and
oversees is used frequently by
the MIPA office he directs. One
MIPA responsibility is the
formulation of all university
policies and procedures.

“We’re responsible for
coordinating all policies,
procedures and necessary forms,”
Timm said. “It doesn’t matter what
the policy or procedure is. It
could be a policy on health
insurance or a permit form needed

for parking. No matter what it is,
it originates from our office.”

MIPA is also responsible for
initiating policy studies. “We do
all kinds of studies about the
university. Do women make as
much as men? Do blacks make as
much as whites? If a new program
is initiated, how much will it cost?
These are just a few of the types
of things that we’ve looked at,”
he said.

Timm speaks of his work and
the accomplishments of his office
with pride and satisfaction.

“My favorite saying is, W e never
have enough time to do it tight,
but we always have enough time
that we do it,’” he said. “The pride
of the office is that when were
given an assignment, we meet
our goals and deadlines. We have
a well-deserved reputation for
getting the job done.”

Timm sometimes spends over
11 hours a day making sure the
job is done right.

“I start at 7 a.m., and I’m here
until 6 [or] 7 p.m. every night. I
used to_teach on my lunch~hour,
but it just became impossible
because of all the demands on
me,” he said. 5

T im, who hasn’t taught classes
in three years, says he misses the

challenges of working with‘

students. Ironically, it was because
Timm disliked his first high—s chool
teaching experience that he
pursued higher education.
“After I got a bachelor’s degree
in mathematics, I did my student
teaching’ but found it very

‘ Science

problematic,” T im said. “While
I could teach mathematics, they
had me doing study hall and hall
duty. I didn't want to be a
disciplinarian. I just wanted to
teach mathematics and physics.”
Timm returned to UCLA and
earned a master’s degree in
mathematics by 1966. Shortly after
he completed the program, he
was recruited by The National
Foundation. The
foundation awarded him a full
scholarship to the University of
California, Berkeley, to pursue a
master’s in statistics and a Ph.D.
in education. 9
While at Berkeley, T im helped
to compile and organize the first
Higher Education and General
Information Survey. Timm
describes it as “the first national
data base on higher education.
We compiled all the payroll,
personnel, financial data and

A more about institutions of higher

learning.”

Timm left Berkeley and came
to Pitt in 1970 as an assistant
professor in » the school of
education. Although he had
always enjoyed teaching, he
moved gradually into
administrative roles.

“I slowly migrated into
administration because many of
the things we were doing were
similar to what I had done at
Berkeley,” he said.

During his career at Pitt, Timm
has authored one book and has
published over 15 monographs
and papers. He also spends what

little free time he has working as
a consultant.

“My wife owns a home health
agency, and I do a lot of
consulting for that. I do all the
financial reporting, taxes and
accounting,” he said. T imm also
does "other consulting as a
statistician.

“I've done statistical consulting
primarily for lawyers who are
involved in litigation in one way
or another,” Timm explained.
“For example, if someone is suing
a company for race, age, sex
discrimination or whatever, I do
the studies to try to prove one
way or another that it is or is not
discriminatory. I basically work
with statistics and the law.”

However, Timm spends most
of his time at the university “taking

care of whatever needs to get

done.”

“I never have a dull day,” he
said. “I like the variety associated
with the job in that every time I
come to work, there is a different
problem that requires a different
solution to be worked on for a
different audience. That’s what is
most challenging to me.”

Although Timm’s
responsibilities and challenges
have changed throughout his two
decades at the university, one
thing has remained the same —
his commitment to hard work.

“I'm someone who truly values
hard work. I don’t think people

can be motivated towards ‘

anything unless they set their
sights on something,” Timm said.

SGB ta/ees oz stoma’. ..

inmost situations, effectiveness relies upon such issues
as timing, importance and relevance. The Student
Government Board has found a place to express student
concerns in a way that is most effective for the students.

On Nov. 20, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board
gave the Pitt faculty the go-ahead to vote on unionization.
Since that time, faculty members have heavily debated the
issue with little or no input from a group which that
decision would ultimately affect: the students.

After three weeks of intense research, the SGB decided
to officially oppose faculty unionization. In a statement to
the university community, SGB President Brent Saunders
said that the SGB opposed it because “the division created
 would compromise the academic achievement.”

This statement came after the SGB looked at the issues,
checked student opinion and debated their own feelings.
This process gave them the best possible set of informed
opinions ——,, something that the SGB has not given the
student population in recent years.

Recently The Pitt News stated that the SGB should not
take a stand on the". issue of the war in the Persian Gulf,
as it did not directly affect the students of this university.
We believe that the unionization issue has more relevance
for students. Although we may not agree with their
position, we applaud the SGB members for their research
and their effort.

The no-name policy. ..

It is_ Day 6 of the ban on campus-police records, and still
the University of Pittsburgh has not given The Pitt News a
credible excuse for restricting its access.

The university claims that it is merely protecting the
students on this campus from public show in the event
that they are accused of, or the victim of, a crime by having
their names printed in something such as the “Campus

' Police Blotter.” Subsequently, the university feels that it is

protecting itself from future lawsuits should those names
be actually published. ‘

Since The Pitt News began the blotter in 1989, it has
never printed the names of victims or suspects of any
crime. This continues to be our policy. Therefore, the
university’s claim that students could hold the university
libelous because their name appeared in the blotter is
completely unfounded.

Professional newspapers regularly print the names of
victims in cases of murder, as well as those arrested for
that and other crimes. This is public information. In cases
of rape, newspapers regularly withhold both names. This
does not force the citypolice to restrict their records.

Until the university can come up with a credible excuse,
The Pitt News will continue to fight to regain access to
what should be public records.

This campus has no humor

I didn’t want to do it. I tried to
get out of writing this column by
asking my editor if I could Cover ‘

a story on anti—American
sentiment in Panama, but he
wouldn’t go for it. So after a
lengthy argument about the plight
of our neighbors to the south
(plus an arm—wrestling match that
I lost pitifully), I was chained to
my computer and forced to write
about the one subject that I
absolutely hate to discuss:
campus events.

It took me a while to come up
with an idea of something I could
lampoon. I struggled long and
hard witlfthis question, and after
hours of meditation and brain-
storming I discovered the root of
my difficulties: People at Pitt have
no sense of humor.

It’s true. The February National
Lampoon predicted a “comedy
crash” this year, but apparently it
has already hit Pittsburgh with a
vengeance. In the past several
months I have seen plenty of
evidence to back me up on this.

One such case happened to
me, in fact, two weeks ago. On
the door of my room I posted a
sign calling for all bloodsucking
leeches to stop begging for a
top—1O list. (It’s a long story.)
Apparently, that sign was
offensive to a member of a
particular group (the blood-
sucking leeches, to be exact).
Before long, the smell of burning
paper wafted through the circular
halls of Tower C, and I came to
the realization that someone did
not get it.

Further evidence can be found
in any underground newspaper.
Have you ever read the humor
section of a “politically correct"
newspaper? Of course not. It

  Adam 
. Richter

didn’t exist.

The paper’s editors dealt with
subjects so depressing not even
Art Buchwald could satirize them
and respect himself in the
morning.

The ﬁnal nail in this coffin of
humor was driven in last week
when the campus police decided
there would be no more “Campus
Police Blotter” in The Pitt News.
This essentially means that for a
laugh most students will now
have to pay attention in class.
When news of this hit, I realized
that the War on Levity had been
declared and the tally was
Fussbudgets 1, Levitarians 0.

“How can you say this?” some
will ask me. “You insensitive
moron!” others will curse. But I
stand firm in my belief. The
university community right now
is suffering a real “crisis in
jocularity.” No one will probably
even ask Pitt's new president if
he/she/it knows any good Dan
Quayle jokes.

80 what is the fate of those of
us who live for bad jokes? Will
sign-bumin g in the dorms become
a regular event? Am I going to see
effigies of Dave Barry burned on
the William Pitt Union lawn? Will
Joe Pittstudent ever be able to
share ethnic jokes with his friends
again? These questions need
serious contemplation, my
friends. '

After some semi-serious
consideration, I came up with a
few simple solutions. First, the
new president of Pitt must have

opposite Steve Martin. This way I

he/she/it can lead the university
community in a new direction of
humor.

Second, designated slapstick
areas should be set up around
campus. Since smoking is now
banned just about everywhere in
Oakland, former smoking lounges
can, with a few banana peels and
fake noses, be converted into
“slapstick spaces.”

Third (and this is the most
important one), people at Pitt
desperately need to start taking
things less seriously. Case in point:
I took an unofﬁcial poll and asked
people who they thought Wes
Posvar’s replacement would be,

hoping I could get some funnygt:

(or at least lighthearted)
responses. Some respondents
speculated that the new president
might be Elvis, Al Bundy or Bob
Mould. A tragic majority of them,
however, chose not to answer
because they did not have a clue.

I almost cried. I showed these
humorless souls the response
sheet with these ludicrous names,
and they still told me they weren’t
informed enough. Sigh.

To those who label themselves
“politically correct,” to everyone
who gets offended when called a
“bloodsucking leech,” to the
public servants who wish to
deprive students of one of the
funniest sections of this
newspaper and to every single
soul who may ﬁnd something so
offensive in this column that he/
she/it will be forced to write a
letter, I say the following:

By Rob Codispot

Pitt track coach John Vasvary
received a pleasant surprise last
Saturday at the Hardee’s
Invitational at West Virginia
University.

Junior Dave Senay took third
place in the shot put with a throw
of 51 feet, 1 1/2 inches.

The throw was a personal-best
mark for Senay and qualified him
for the IC4A Championships.

The meetwill  held on March
2 at Princeton University in New
Jersey.

“Dave made a big jump —— a 2-
foot jump — from his previous
high throw,” Vasvary said. “I’m
really pleased with his
improvement.”

Vasvary was also pleased with
the performance of the distance
medley relay team of Mike
Formica, Chris Nauman, Jason
Bodnar and Keith Dowling.

That quartet_won the distance
medley relay with a time of 10
minutes, 7.74 seconds.

The win also qualified that
group for the IC4A Cham-
pionships.

“Our main goal at WVU was to

“We wanted to .

take care of that, and they did.”

Other finishers for the Panthers
were Wayne Smith, who finished
second in the 800 meter with a
time of 1:55.5, andJim Hamilton,
who ﬁnished third in the 5,000
meter at 15:07.5.

The meet featured approxi-
mately 15 schools, including
Eastern Kentucky, Ohio
University, Bowling Green and
James Madison: “A pretty good
field,” according to Vasvary.

The Panthers took only a split
squad to West Virginia, with the
other half heading for a meet at
Nebraska.

“We didn’t run some of the
relays because we have the Big
East Championships coming up
[this weekend at Syracuse
Universityl," Vasvary said. “We
want to keep some of the guys
rested.”

Duo—dimensionality in Big East

By Derek Willis
Staff Writer

Defense continues to be a
hallmark of Big East play for
several reasons. Obviously, there
are many talented defensive
players and several teams which
rely on intense pressure to win
games. There is also the physical
style of play, which lends itself to
lower shooting percentages. But
the more important reason is the
concept of offensive duo-

ANALYSIS

dimensionality.

Duo—dimensionality goes
something like this: Some teams
rely on a one-two scoring punch,
rather than balance, to carry the
offensive load.

One example will be on display
tonight at the Meadowlands for
the Pitt-Seton Hall game. The
Pirates’ Anthony Avent and Terry

Dehere are the obvious offensive
leaders, sometimes to a fault. As
a team, Seton Hall is young and
inexperienced, so those two must
score for the team to even have a
chance of winning.

Looking around the league,
there are other scoring duos: Billy
Owens and Dave Johnson of
Syracuse, Dikembe Mutombo and
Alonzo Mourning at Georgetown,
Malik Sealy and Jason Buchanan
of St. John's, and Chris Smith and

Pitt divers
still reign
supreme

By Jim Lakely
stag“ Writer

If there is ever a question as to
-who the greatest diver in Pitt
history is, look no further than
John Sharkey. He set new school,
meet and pool records in winning
the 1- and 3-meter titles to go
with his third consecutive Most
Outstanding Diver award in the
Big East diving championships
last weekend in Trees Pool.

On the 1-meter board, Sharkey
shattered the old Big East
Championship record by 65
points with a score of 621.90.
This was Sharkey’s last meet in

Trees Pool, and the senior called ,

it his greatest moment as a
collegiate diver.

“I‘m elated about the 1-meter
score,” Sharkey said. “Not too
many people have even gone
above 610. I’m real excited
because that is my all—time high.
I hit all 11 of my dives, and I hit

all of my 3.03 [degree of difficulty]. .

I got eights on all my dives and a
nine here and there. I don’t think
I am going to come close to that
again for a while.”

Freshman Sean Braud and
junior PhilCruz sweptinto second
and third place, respectively, for
the Panthers on the 3-meter board,
giving Pitt’s swim team a big
boost. In fact, without the divers
strong, Pitt may not have repeated
as Big East Champion.

“‘Cushion by diving’ is what I
call it,” said swim coach Chuck
Knoles. “And we have gone to it
many times this year. Krug is
doing a hell of a job with them.
He. started out with some real
green stuff this year and turned it
into gold stuff at the end of the
season.”

Theclosest Big East competitor,

\Connecticut’s Neal Newhouse,
was nearly 200 points behind
Sharkey’s winning score. This is
something that discourages diving
coach Julian Krug. “For John to
win and be that far ahead of a
diver from another school is not
really competition,”

Krug said. “I talk to the coaches

Scott Burrell of Connecticut.

Some of these pairs are the
classic “inside-outside” duo, like
Avent and Dehere. To a certain
extent, this makes them easier to
defend, since most teams have
either a competent inside
defender, a competent outside
defender, or both.

Even with just one good
position defender, the game can
usually be won. Without the
added dimension of a Malik Sealy
or a Dave Johnson, the offenses
of these ‘classiciduo teams
become easier to break down
and prepare for.

The dangerous pairs are the
unorthodox ones, like the “Twin
T owers" of G—town or the multi-
talented duos at Syracuse and St.

A John’s.

It should come as no surprise
that the top three teams (early in
the season) have players who are
the hardest to defend. This is
because they present so many
match-up problems for opposing
teams.

Having Owens and Johnson in
the frontcourt gives the
Orangemen several different
offensive options and creates
havoc for the opposition. There

are no frontcourts that match up A

with those two on a consistent
basis. The same is true about
Mutombo and Mourning.

The pair at St. John’s seems like
the classic duo, but really isn’t.
Sealy is, unquestionably, a multi-
skilled player. Buchanan has
become a better all-around player
by designing his game around
Sealy’s. As a pair, they are just as
difﬁcult to stop as any in the
league.

The teams and duos not listed
above (Villanova, Providence,
Boston College and Pitt) are all
different cases. ‘Nova is by far the
most balanced team in the
conference, which will make it

very dangerous come tournament
time. Any number of players are
capable of having big nights for
the Wildcats, as was evidenced
by reserve James Bryson’s 21
points in Villan'ova’s win over St.
John’s last week. “

This balance allows the
Wildcats to alter a game in terms
of match—ups. Villanova can play
big or quick lineups without
sacriﬁcing the offensive ability of
the team. Very few teams enjoy
this luxury.

Providence, as everyone
knows, is a one—man team, and

Boston College is still looking for .

any offensive leaders. Pitt is a
special case, of course. The
Panthers can be both a two-man
team and a balanced team, but
can’t seem to decide which one is
better or more natural.

The duo of Jason Matthews
and Brian Shorter can dominate a
game, but as evidenced by
Saturday’s game against BC, there

are other players capable of

stepping up and shouldering the
scoring burden.

Bobby Martin, Sean Miller and
Darelle Porter are all able to
score 15 to 20 points on any
given day, and with an improving
bench, give Pitt a potentially
balanced attack. The key word is
“potentially,” because the

Panthers have not always used

their depth.

The benefit of depth is the
ability to overcome excellent
defensive play by the opposition
and distribute the load among
many players.

On a one-game basis, it is hard
to beat (or match up) with teams
like St. John’s, Syracuse and
Georgetown. This is why those
three will finish among the top
three spots during the regular
season, but will encounter
difﬁculty from ‘Nova and Pitt in
the postseason because of their
superior depth.

Another thing that bothers
me is that Richards hurt himself
by coming out early.

He is passing up an outside
shot at the Heisman Trophy.
Coming off an injury-plagued
season when his production
was down, he will fall in the
NFL draft to somewhere
between the second and fourth
rounds — maybe further.

If he came back and had a
year near what he did his first
two years, he would go early
in the first round. This all
leaves out the fact that he
didn’t get his degree.

did it, it doesn’t mean you
should worship him. Grow
up. V
Rose did his crime when he
was a manager.

Hell, he wasn’t any good as g‘,

a manager anyway; it was what
he did as a player that made
him one of the all-time greats.
Rose belongs in the Hall. Q

0 If I hear one more baseball
fan give me a countdown to
spring training, I will be sick.
I like the game too, but get a
life, guys.

-Time for me to go. I have
to go find a place to live.

“I used to be a very social
person and visit a lot of bars.
When I stopped drinking, I
realized that I didn't have any
friends to turn to. This AA
fellowship has shown me what
true friends are,” said Carla.

The Pitt meetings are for anyone
who thinks that he or she has a
problem dealing with alcohol
and/or drugs. .

“There are a lot of problems
that stem from drinking. Not only
are they physical and
psychological, but emotional as

well,” Carla said.

“These meetings let us share
these problems openly and help
us to realize that others are
experiencing the same things that
we are going through,” she said.

Carla said that she would like
to see more Pitt students attend
these AA meetings. She wants
them to know that there are
people out there who understand
what they are going through.

“If people would just come to
one of our meetings, I could
reach out to them and help
someone,” said Carla.

Shirley Haberman, health-
education administrator, said that
she also hopes these meeting can
generate a bigger turnout.

Haberman said that since Friday
night may not be a good night for
some students, the university is
starting up another group on
Tuesday at 6 p.m.

The university is also randomly
sending out a drug survey to
students to try to get a clearer
picture of what substances
students abuse and to try to tailor-
fit a recovery program to the
students’ needs, she said.

Area also forms a spring-break task force, aimed at
managing and coordinating spring break.

These programs work ateverything from planning
beachside activities to keeping students informed
about drinking and conduct laws.

If a student who is at least 18 years old is caught
drinking underage, he or she has two options. One
is to plead guilty to a second-degree misdemeanor
and pay a $110 fine. The second is to plead
innocent, receive a Notice To Appear, and attend
court. Those people under 18 who choose to drink
and subsequently get caught face a worse
punishment. These people are taken into custody,
held for the period necessary for them to become

detoxicated and then released to a legal custodian
or “responsible adult” who is responsible for
seeing that the minor attend his or her day in court.
Patrolling of the Daytona area more than triples
during the week of spring break, with city, state

and local police all patrolling the area.

responsibly.

“Party Smart” is the theme for this year, and it
follows a program designed by the Beer Drinkers
of America. The California—based organization is
very involved with promoting responsible drinking.
In Daytona, for instance, much of its energy is
spent distributing buttons and posters to bars and
their clientele. It neither promotes nor discourages
drinking; it only encourages people to do it

Unable to hold back a
comment, Wetzler takes off his
glasses and moves away from his
computer to interrupt White.
“Even through all of those years

of working at night, I don’t think
he lost his sanity,” he says.

By now it is close to midnight,
and except for two or three

reporters, the newsroom is like a '

ghost town. White yawns and
says that after 20 years of working

at night, the hours don’t bother
him.

‘‘I do admit I run out of gas
sometimes,” he says. “It is a
different lifestyle and a lot of
people don’t like this, but after a
while my body got used to it.”
