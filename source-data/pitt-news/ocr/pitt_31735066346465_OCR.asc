Advisor ‘Disappointed,

Discouraged’ With SG

By JIIVI NELSON
“Student Government should completely reorganize. or
dissolve,” Bernard Adams charged the Student Senate Mon-
clay.-Adams, special assistant to the chancellor. said that he
had come as advisor to SG with many ideas, but that he is

somewhat discouraged now.

In defense of this stand, Adams said that the administra-

tion sometimes gets so wrappedO

up in the future that the present
 forgotten.

A committee report to the Sen-
ate on the possibility of having
a work—study program served as
an example.

Part Time School >

The work-study program is a
curriculum in which the student

'attends school for several terms

and then works for several terms
at a job in his major ﬁeld of
study.

The program gives the
ﬁnancial gains to help
thigh price of a college educa-
tion and gives him an oppor-
tunity for experience in his ma-
jor ﬁeld.

Adams said that this possibility
was suggested to the officials
three years ago, but that nothing
was done about it in Student Gov-
ernment.

In the Senate there was an in-
terest in the program but there
were no volunteers to get this
idea going in the administration,
where something “could be done
about it.

Lets Things Go

“Students. should be expressing
their opinions and be doing things
in these areas,” Adams said. He
implied that many times the Sen-
ate lets points of major concern
and interest go by with little more
than discussion. Adams named
several current areas where action

MC Offers

To Continue
Book Exchange

As Student Government decid-
ed to suspend operation of the
Student Book Exchange. Men's
Council volunteered to help SG
keep the exchange going; '

Men’s Council passed a resolu-
tion stating that. they recommend
to SG “that the Student Book Ex-

change be continued next tri-
mester.”

In a letter to SG vice president
Jay Fingeret, Howard Solomon,
secretary of MC. called the SG
institution of the exchange “a
valuable service for the student
body” anditold Fingeret that “the

questionnaires we have received

from freshmen have greatly sup-—
ported this program.”

“Men’s Council," S 01 o m o n
wrote, “urges SG to reconsider
this suggestion. We offer our sin-
cere encouragement and will co-
operate with SG in any way pos-
sible to insure the continuance
of the Student Book Exchange?’

Student Government reported at
their meeting that they felt the

Teeters’ Resi'gn.iat/in/n Cited as ‘SC Loss’

Student Opinion Of Senate Varies

By MATT SWEETONJBC

In an effort to establish the op-
inion of the University's student
body concerning the recent resig-
nation of Patricia Teeters as vice-
president of Student Government,
the Pitt News has interviewed a
number of students informally
asking their opinion on her resig-
nation and how they believe it
will effect SG.

The following are a few of the
answers given in the poll.

Jeffrey Hirsch, Arts, soph..: “She
impressed me as one of the more
dynamic forces in SG. Her resig-
nation may ultimately mean the
decline and fall of SC. It is alomst
impossible for one girl, no matter
how determined she is, to ﬁght
the apathy which is so undoubt-

edly prevalent in SG, and for this
reason she probably resigned,”

Steve Johnson, Arts, fr.: “Her
resignation has been a very great
loss for SG here at Pitt but prob-
ably a great gain for Pat Teeters
personally.

“I think that there are other
people in SC} who can continue
doing the job, but I also feel that
they may very well be discourag-
ed and feel that the things which
they still might accomplish may
not be worth the effort.”

Leroy Henry, Engr. jr.,: “i
would like to know the real rea-
son why Pat Teeters resigned. If
it's because of ill health as Rich-
ard Sobota says then I feel that
she ‘made the only logical move
under the circumstances.

“However, if the real reason is
because of her discouragement. I
would say that it’s a sign that SC}
is not doing its job.

“I do think that Pat should re-
consider her decision, because the
solution to the problem is not
resignation. If she does decide to
:follow her original decision. this
would be an increasing of the
downward acceleration of SO.

Stanley Stein, Arts. soph: “I
believe that SG will feel the loss,
because she was a stabilizzing ele-
ment against the incompetence of
Richard Sobota.”

Many students either refused to
give their opinion on the matter
or else were unaware of the facts
concerning Miss Teeters’ resigna-
tion.

Dorm Couiicil
Seelks Charter

A search through the offices on
the eighth floor of the Cathedral
has provided l\/[en's Residence
Council with the basis for a con-
stitution.

A Ed Hall, president of Schcnley/"s

ninth floor and head of the Coun- ‘

cil’s Constitution Committee. went
to the olfices of the dean of men

to search for information in the
constitutions of other similar
groups. A

He found the constitution of an
old Residence Council which had
been defunct. Revisions had to be
made to bring the constitution up
to modern standards.

Notes Changes

Hall noted some of the changes.

Formerly a separate judicial
council had existed; provisions for
this had to be striken out. Floor
presidents and vice presidents had
functioned together. Now the
great number of dormitory floors
necessitates concentrating only on
the floor presidents.

The constitution. Hall ex-
plained. was necessary because
“we ‘had to decide what we
would cover so we wouldn’t
o'verlap the functions of Stu-
dent‘ Government or Men’s
Council."
l~la_ll said that copies of the new

constitution would be available

sometime before the end of the

Fall trimester. A

Campus Area
By JIM HUFNAGEL

The Cathedral of Learning
will become the focal point of
Oakland 1980 as envisioned by
the Allcoheny Conference on
Community Development.

Their master plan for the
Oakland
during the next twenty years,
which was officially unveiled
Monday evening. calls for in-

redevelopment of

rtensive expansion and integra-

tion of the areas cultural. educa-
tional and medical facilities.
Recognizing that “Pitt is the
most dominant factor in the health
of Oakland” the plan coincides
with the University’s drive to pro...
vide integrated campus facilities
for almost twice present enroll-
ment. Before these facilities can
be provided, however. several of
Oakland's major traffic arteries
must be relocated and improved.
Roads Rerouted

To improve trafﬁc circulation in. ‘

the area the plan calls for a re-
routing of Bigelow Boulevard to
meet Belleﬁeld Avenue at Centre
Avenue and continue along Belle-
field to Forbes Avenue. Forbes,

nue will be a light traffic, “cam-
pus street."

Fifth Avenue and Oakland
will be widened and improved
and Oakland‘ Avenue will be
redesigned as a “tree-lined
Boulevarr " dividing the Uni-
viers*ity campus from the Oak-
land commercial-residential dis-
trict.

Observing that Oakland needs
at least 6200 additional parking
spaces by 1980, the master plan
suggests the construction of a 700
car. multi-level, parking garage
beneath Schenley Plaza, and four
other public parking structures,
including another 620 car sub-
surface facility in front of S01-
diers and Sailors Memorial, The
Allegheny Community Conference
also suggests that additional park-
ing facilities be provided by “var-
ious combinations of local public
program will need at least 26
and private institutions."

Bernard Adams Urges Sena.te
To Completely Reorganize

should be incited by student gov-
ernment.

“I think it is very sad that no
action is being taken in getting
‘a University chaplain in a Uni-
versity of this size,” he said. “It
is also pitiful that the University
library cannot be open for text-
book study or any other kind of
study until at least midnight on
weekdays. Student ‘help should
make this convenience possible.”

These points referred to recent
discussions which the Senate has
apparently dropped without ac-
tion. A

Tied by Complexitics

Adams said that Student Gov-

ernment could take vital. steps to

put their beliefs into action for

the student body, but that they
are tied down by such a complex
operation that they had trouble
getting anything of major im-
portance into action. SG should
get busy reorganizing the group
or it should dissolve and forget

students want," he added.

When asked about the ‘recent
sponsoring by the ninth floor of
Holland Hall of a discussion on
Communist brainwashing, Hall
said that he felt some activities
have to be initiated by individ-
ual ﬂoors independent of the
Council.

“They are encouraged to undcr- -

take activities they feel have lim-
ited appeal or that would best be
conducted in small groups,” he
concluded.

concluded.

In other business, the Senate

He was oﬂicially elected and in-

The campus administrator in-

purpose of NSA to the Senate.
The University currently is not
a member of NSA, and the Senate
is ‘investigating the possible merits

acres of new space. It therefore
suggests that the University move
into the Schenley Farms area
which lies west of Fifth Avenue
and North of Bigelow Boulevard.

They also suggested that the
University acquire Syria
Mosque, Soldiers and Sailors

Memorial, the Pittsburgh Ath- ~

letic Association and the Ma-
sonic Temple “should these in-
stitutions decide to move from
their ‘present sites at any time
in the future."

Total cost of the plan, minus
anticipated revenues from resale
of land to private and other de-
velopers, is estimated at over $54
million, two-thirds of which would

‘be paid by the Federal Govern-

ment: and one-third by local gov-
ernment.

The master plan was prepared
during the past two years by the
Pittsburgh Regional Planning As-
sociation «under the direction of
its executive director Michael J.
Cusick, Jr.

The PRPA suggested that the
City Council adopt the master
plan as an omcial document and
integrate it with the city-wide
master plan, now being revised.

Lectures‘ Occasionally Amount to 5 Hou.r.s Daily

Guides Reflect Origin, History

Oi. Heinz Memorial Chapel

By RAISHA SILBERMANV
Two alternating guides con-,

duct tours through the Heinz~

Memorial Chapel. explaining
in beautiful detail the origins
and meanings of this French
masterpiece.

C. R. Schenline and Thomas Ar~
nold ll;l\.'€‘ carefully studied every
point about the history and sig—
nificance of the Chapel until de—
livery of a talk, entirely by heart,
is second nature for them.

“I love my work and am proud
to be a part of this University."
said one of the lcctu.rc~rs quietly.
This feeling was r<>.flr.;*<.'i:ed in the
tone of his voice he spoke
about the Chapel.

Countries Represented

In a typical lcc’turc. the guide
dlS(:U.*s‘.<:‘d everything possible con-
cerning the Chapel. He noted the
aI‘Chil,e('t, an American. Charles J.
Kla.ud-wr. He told about the Henry
J. Heinz family who donated the
Chapel to the University in order
that. non~denominational services
could ‘be conductcdbn campus.

He pointed out the l1andcarv-
ed wood from England and the

Egyptian Numidian marble of

the altar. Proudly he described

the true Cartneginian antique

stained‘ glass windows. Then, in
reverent tones, he related the
stories of the many ﬁgures in
these irreplacable windows.

“I always tell people that al-
though the Chapel is designed by
an American, the materials in it
are of differing national origins.”
The guide feels there is a connec-
tion between this and the fact
that the Chapel is open to all
people. regardless of religious af-
ﬁliation.

Met Nehru Family

The guide may lecture for four
or ﬁve hours continuously in one
day. He is proud of the contacts
he has made with people from all

118

He told of an experience with
a group of 88 French architects
who desired a lecture. An inter-
‘pretcr was supplied and the

entire lecture was translated
for them. L
The guide remembers with.

particular pride meeting the wife
and daughter of Prime Minister
Nehru of India when they visited.
In his words, “I must be prepared
for anything."

“Ch:.i:-ity for all" is the theme
of the Heinz Memorial Chapel.
This theme is depicted in the
center window above the chancel
and constantly represented by the
gracious guide who welcomes

‘leveryonc to the Chapel at any
time.

FORMATION
A Christian Science student
group is being formed at the
"University. Students and fac-
ulty who are interested should
see Mrs. Beatty, l926CL. about
meeting time and place.

Wednesday, November 22. 1961 -.-— THE  NEWS -—- Patti?‘ 3

Pep ClubSets Rally  

We want to extend this to the
wholeschool on other matters
besides football.

"Although we may not continue
our activities beyond the football
season,” Miss McGuire continued,
"we will try to expand from an
SG committee to a Pep Club and
really function strongly next Sep-
tember.” _.

The Pep for Pitt Committee was
formed by Student Government to
replace the Block P trick card
section which disappeared after
last year’s Pitt—Penn State foot-
ball game.

Ruth. McGuire, president of the
SG Pep for Pitt committee, an-
nounced that a Pep Rally will be
held this evening at 7:30 in the
Schenley Quadrangle. The Varsity
Band will attend and the football
team will also try to be there
if training commitments do not
prevent them.

The Trophy Contest will close
Saturday during halftime of the
Pitt—Pen State game when troph-
ies will be awarded to the frater-
nity and sorority which have ac-
cumulated the most points by con—
tributing to school spirit.

“The kids have really worked,"
she said. “We’ve started some
real school spirit, at least on the
fraternity and sorority level.

Meeting A cﬁourned  

‘ The dissolution of Student Government would be one
of the wisest moves made in the University this term. As
has been stated repeatedly, SG has no power, it cannot
legislate and, worst of all, it is not even a sounding board
foristudent opinion. But aside from these problems, SG
should be abolished because it is no longer wanted or
needed by students. ’

The past election farce exempliﬁed the scorn students
bear their “governing” organization. Students do not re-
spect the organization nor do they recognize any possible
value in it. And every year it’s the same story. Of the sen-
ators elected last term, a large number have dropped out
voluntarily or have been removed as “dead wood” so that
now, by the end of November_, senators are still struggling
desperately to ﬁll the empty chairs instead of concentrat-
ing on issues such as the work-study program suggested
by Bernard Adams. ’

The most recent vacancy left by the resignation of vice
president Pat Teeters demonstrates this disinterest pre-
valent in most University students. Of the 50 people polled
by this paper on the issue, only ﬁve knew the situation
well enough to comment on it while the majority admitted
that they dldl’_"i.:t even know who Pat Teeters was.

Appallingiias this situation is, it is not unique to the
university. Schools all over the country are faced with the
same problems, yet nowhere will anyone admit that stu-
dents just dontcgpre and accept that answer. Fraternity
‘men can take the-ir\pr,oblems to. Inter-Fraternity Council.
The women students’ band together under AWS. Student
Union Board provitales enough entertainment and intellect-
ual pursuits to suit most students, and Men’s Council ﬁlls
in where the dormitory councils leave off. -

For those diehards who insist that SC} is a co-ordinating
body, senators are elected by schools not by organization.

H‘ Their problemsiseldom even reach the -Senate mee-ting

rooms until their overlapping‘ committees meet while in-
vestigating the same situation and a boundary squabble
arises. ’
It’s time this pretense of a student governing body
were eliminated. Students obviously do not want to be gov-
erned nor do they need the kind of help SG pretends to give.

foreign Forum No. All .... " A I I 

Cadilacs And Cowsi

By Roslmn K. Fcrlell

.This is the first in a series of (‘O1-’u.’mrl'l»s written
by foreign exchange stiideiits. The space for the
“Foreign Forum” has been allotted for these writ-
ers -to express their opiriioiis on any subject and
in-ariy manner they wish.

Ever since I came to the States, I have met curi-
ous Americans, some with gross misconceptions of
the land that is India. I have been asked questions
ranging from “Is Nehru going communist?” to "Do

the Indians have separate lavatories for ladies and”

gents?” I am no longer sur-
prised if a stranger accosts me in
the street, with “Excuse me,
Miss, are you from India? I
have always wanted to know"
what the Indian woman wears
for a nightdress.” Most Ameri-
cans picture India as a land of
maharajas, palaces, fakirs, snake
charmers, and elephants. In fact
India is all this, but much, more.
Perhaps no other country is as
rich in extremes and contradic-

tions. It is a country at once beautiful and ugly,

rich and poor, happy and discontented —— it is an
ever-changing kaleidoscope.

Walking down a street in Bombay, one is
dazzled by the color and life of the throbbing heart
of the city—-the jostling crowds, where the smart
career woman walks past the starving leper; the
college girls in bouffant hairstyles and stiletto heels,
pastithe sacred cows. Where Cadillacs and cows
and French perfumes and crows and urchins all
mix in one great beautiful city.

Looking down from the Hanging Gardens over
the tops of the Gul Mohurs and Laburnums, onto
the great sweep of the Marine Drive, one tries to
avoid the appalling modern structures called build-
ings, which have sprung up in the last few years.
At the northern end of Bombay lies India’s first
atomic energy plant, with three reactors. From
the huge, metal dome of. the Canada-India Reactor,
one can look across the Arabian Sea to the nearby
isle of Elephanta, where, carved into the thick lux-
uriant tropical mountainside, are the ancient Hindu
caves dating from about 500 A.D. Here the great
Trimurthi, the three-faced bust of Siva the Hindu
god, portraying Rudra the Destroyer, Brahma the

Educated Criminals . . .

 

Creator, and Vishnu the Preserver, may be found;
the three together form the Saivite Trinity of
Hinduism, -Brahma. Standing under the giant stone
bust of Brahma and~looking onto the glistening
dome of the atomic reactor, one experiences a
great feeling of agelessness. The Indian is never
in a hurry; he is unpunctual, ineﬁicient, and takes
life easy. This sense of timelessness is reflected
very strikingly in the holy cows standing around in
the streets —- lazy, indifferent, contented. The
Hindus hold the cow sacred, and the cow loves it!

But it is not the city that makes India what it is.
Ninety per cent of the population of the country
lives in the villages, of which there are about 550,-
OOO. Here, the simple folk still preserve the an...
cinet codes and customs. India has come a long
way from the days when the Untouchables Vverg
held in disdain. The new constitution abolished

 

.,_*‘,x.,

caste distinction, but a pattern of thought so ‘in.

grained in the minds of the people cannot be legis-
lated out of existence overnight.

Child marriages are common. In most cases,
marriages are arranged by the parents after care-
ful consideration of family backgrounds and status.
Often an astrologer is consulted to give his opinion
on the match. The traditional Indian girl does not
n€C€SS31'i1.V ma1‘I‘,V the man she loves, but she in-
variably loves the men she marries. An Indian mar-
riage is a very expensive and elaborateafiair _.
after all, it comes but once in a lifetime ~— and the
bride’s father gets the worse end of the bargain.

Though English is still the main language in
the cities and official circes, India recognizes four-

teen languages and-there are over 700 other lan-

guages and dialects. It is not surprising, then, that
the Indian Rupee bill contains the words
rupee” not only in 9 different languages, but in 9
di1"l‘erent scripts!

India has a rich and impressive cultural heri-
tage, but she is not content to lie back on her glor-
ious past. She is rising to the challenge of a mod-
ern age; and withher enterprising spirit and de-
termination, she is making tremendous steps to-
ward an even richer future. There is no time to
waste; there isa great urgency today in India to
leap ahead to get from the bullock cart to the
atomic power station. As Nehru once remarked,
“India must run before she has learned to wzilk.”

  Professional Unethics

By ’MuH'

If one were to deﬁne vocational ethics as being
a person following a profession for the sake of the
prot'ession itself and not merely for the beneﬁts
received, a certain ugly fact would soon make itself
obvious. It would become very dilﬁcult, if not com-
impossible, to discover
more than a handful of occupa-
tions into which the majority‘ of
the practitioners have not intro-
duced their own shoddy and un-
ethical standards.

This is not to say, however,
that in the professions them-
selves there is not a certain code
of ethics which all are required
to follow to some extent. One _
hears of such terms as medical

ethics, political ethics, and busi-

ness ethics; however, these sets of moral standards
are conﬁned to the occupations,-themselves and
It might even be sa fe to assume that there is some

sort of code of ethics for pickpockets and second-
story‘men although it must surely be on a lower
plane that that of the clergy, or even sandhogs.

Usingias a basis the deﬁnition of a profession
for the sake of the profession itself, one can
plainly see how few occupations meet this re-
quirement for an ethical vocation. Politicians, as
a starting example, are among the most unethical
creatures that America has yet produced. Scarcely
in the history of our great land have there been
more than a half dozen purely moral politicians
who have advanced beyond the position of local dog
catcher; and only one. Woodrow Wilson, has ever,
in our time, risen to hold the office of the Presi-
deiicy.

VVilson came into ollice at a time when America
was in the midst of a great social revival, and he
took the couiiti'y’s ‘acceptance of him as an ac-
ceptance also of his ethical ideals. When, how-
ever, the war ended and the people realizccl his
truly moral outlook for the future, they disovvned
him and in his place substituted the ethical depra-
vation of the big—business-controlled Harding
administration. .

cal i.n/their beliefs either. Who of , us can truth-

College Queens make
great discovery in New York!

Of course, they loved the city-the fun and the excitement.
But they also learned about diamond rings—discovered there
is a way to be sure of the diamond you buy. They saw how
Artcarved guarantees every diamond in writing for color,
cut, clarity and carat weight. They were impressed by the
proof of value offered by Artcarved’s nationally-advertised
Permanent Value Plan, backed by the quality reputation of
this 110 year old ﬁrm. And, they were most [delighted with i
Artcai'vcd’s magniﬁcent assortment of award-winning styles.

Visit your local Artcarved jeweler and see all the wonder-
ful Artcarved styles, including those selected as the “10 best”

ONLY A YARD LOST
The Panther football team h . B b F ' - _
back like Ohio State, nor a Rozhsniiao B311 iiiifugéglgi fbldt
aha quartet of bulldozers that Coach John Michelosen has at
and are as good collectively as any mdividual in the country.
f As a group, the four have charged 556 yards in 140 rushes
Ipr a four—yard average clip. The best of the bunch, Rick
eeson, 1s«the only one that has lost any yardage whatsover
-—-one yard against West Virginia.
Leeson, however, has ._more than done penance for
that mortal sin. He has gamed 357 yards in nine games

this year, eclipsing the 349.yard high of 1960 set by Bob
Clemens. ”

  

, Chester Smith, the grand-
‘ daddy of the Pittsburgh Press
. sports staff, said, “Leeson
, came of age in that Southern
1 California game.”

Leeson not only gained 80
yards on 19 carries, but he ac-
 counted for 17 tackles and de-
qﬂf 1, ﬂected the two-point conver-
" 1.» sion try just enough to thwart
A the effort.

Slaby Studies. Too

Another of the fullbacks
Lou Slaby who studies school-
work enough to maintain a 3.2
Q.P.A. in Chemical Engineer-

ing, was supposed to have in-
herited departed Jim Cun-
ningham’s job this year, but
with the other trio around,
he was relegated to playing defense and he’s become an-
other Sam Huﬁf, backing up the line.

Slaby has only carried the ball eight times this year,
but he has been a sulking bull on defense. “He’s the only guy
that I ever saw stop Ernie Davis with one outstretched arm,”
Syracuse Coach Ben Schwartzwalder said. Slaby is so pow-
erful that he has used this test of physical strength on the
best of them.

Whenever» the ground is soggy and a fumbilitis epi-
demic breaks out,.S1aby is put in the running slot. “He’ll
never drop the ball once it’s stuck in his stomach,” one of‘
the coaches said. i

During the pre—season drills Michelosen was asked about
three of his fullbacks. “Don‘t forget about (John) Telesky,”
he cautioned the writer. And the enemy defenses haven’t
been able to forget about the sophomore tower of strength
since. Telesky has gained 85 yards so far.

“When he hits into that line,” one of his teammates says,
“it just goes boom.” The fella emphasized the impact, by
throwing his arms akimbo. “Guys actually ﬁy,” he added.
Chisdak Churning ‘ . ,

John Chisdak is not to be forgotten either. The transfer
from Southern California who was the most sought after
high school back in the state of Pennsylvania during his prep
days at Scranton High, has the best average of the lot.

Chisdak, who has a brother Bob on the team, has
gained 98 yards on 18 rushes for a 5.4 average gain. “He
runs like a pro, and he has all the moves,” a scout for the

National Football League toldus earlier in the season.

Sever Toretti, who has been scouting the Pitt team for
Penn State, said, “When I watch those four guys from high
up in the stands I start to wonder Who I’d start if I were
coach. I’d probably close my eyes, but don’t tell anyone that
Rip (Engle) picks his lineups that way.”

. On Saturday Engle has a choice between Dave Hayes
and Buddy Torris at fullback for State. Michelosetfs prob-
lems are more complicated already; he has to decide which
of four to start. ‘

overuse, such as “a hard-fought
battle, team effort, how bad we

Hawks Out To

Down Cowards

Pitt News Staff Seeks to Break Victory Jinx;
Daily Collegians Again Led by Veteran John Black
\The Cowards of the Penn State Daily Collegian will

travel to Pittsburgh’ on‘Saturday to engage in combat with
the Pitt News Hawks at 10 a.m. in what is laughingly re-

’ ferred to as a football game.

It will be the fourth meeting between the two jugger-
nauts and the Hawks will be trying for their first win.

Athletic Director
“Beer—Be1ly” Nesvisky has ap-
pointed Art “Big Daddy” Fleisch-
ner as coach for the encounter.
“Big Daddy” has been hard at
work plotting strategy for the
game -— So hard in fact that he
failed to call a practice.

However, this has not damp-
ened the mentor’s outlook.
“With the talent we have I’m
sure we will emerge victorious.
With the likes of Len “Stick”
Berenﬁeld who stands in at 6’-
4” and Jim “Simon Legree” O’-
Brien, I don’t see how we can
lose,” stated “Big Daddy.”

The coach, in typical modesty,
failed to mention his ability on
the grid, which is‘ outstanding.

Others who will be seeing ac-
tion for the Hawks are Elliott

Matthewe

“Bulldog" Drexler, Bob “Ditka”
Smizik, Jim “Do I Have To Play"
Hugnagel. Barry “Chicken” Gross,

and Bob “Gilette—less‘ Rappa—
port.

Coach Fleischner said he may
enter a protest over the eligibil-
ity of the Coward's star fullback
Johnny Black. “Big Daddy” feels
that, “B1ack’s been playing for
them long enough to have grad-
uated four times. I will check
with the NCAA to see if he is
eligible.” ,

“Beer-Belly has made a promise
to come up with a few sleepers
for the contest, but refused to
divulge their names. But, he did
predict an outcome, “It I don’t
play well win easily.”

known for his quick sinil.e and silver hair, but not for his

silver-tongued oratory.

And like any other sane member of his profession, Engle

will go out of his way to keep from knocking a future op— '

ponent. So the Ripper had nothing to say about the charges

that Pitt has been playing far be-0--~*~-—~w

low its potential this year.
On the contrary, Englc had
nothing but praise for the belit-
tled-of—late P a nth e r s. “Pitts-

Rip Engl he added, ,"You

should be 3-5 and one loss for the
Pitt News. Please don't make any
‘garbage’ remarks when you write
that column. We‘ll have our hands
full as it is."

And so, well-remembering
the recent experience of a col.
league. there will be no “gar-
bage’ remarks. But that sort of
thing happens to the best of us.

But before we get too far_off
the track, let’s get down to essen-
tials-~sizing up Penn State.

In a completely uncharacter-
istic remark, Engle told one
New York sports writer early
this season that this year’s Lion
team had more potential than
any squad he has coached in the
past.

Most pre-season polls agreed
with Engle. State was rated in the

tory over Navy, then was jolted
at Miami 25-8. The Lions came
back against Boston University,

ing Syracuse 14-0 and Califor-

pressive in a 21-17 defeat at
Maryland; out West Virginia
down to size, 20-6 and walloped
Holy Cross soundly this past
weekend, 34-14. That gives the
Lions a 6-3 record going into
Saturday’s game.

If State gets by Pitt, Engle will
start thinking about a bowl bid.
But as things stand now, the Lions
are about as popular with the se-
lection committee as John Kuprok
at West Virginia’s annual gridiron
banquet. '

And Engle knows better than
anyone else that the underdog
wins more often than not when
these two neighbors get togeth-
er.

“Lct’s face it, we both play the

we. And somehow it still manages
to stay clean. But after it’s all
over, you feel as though you’ve
played the whole season in one
game.” ‘"

Winter Sports Schedule Out

Carroll H. Cook, director of sports information, has announced
that the 1961-1962 Winter Sports Schedule has been released and
that students will be able to procure a copy at the Student Union

desk or at the information center

The little pocket folder includes
the schedules of the basketball.
gymnastics, wrestling, swimming,
squash, riﬂe, and track teams. It
is an ideal guide in as much as
it gives the dates for each sport

individually and then provides an
overall calendar so that dates
aren’t mixed up.

The fine Panther soccer team closes a successful season
today, hosting the Nittany Lions of Penn State. Last year
the Cats upset the Lions, 2-1 in a rousing overtime game.

The Panthers. were trailing last season 1-0 with only 45

minutes remaining in the over-
time period, Cuthbert passing
from the wing to Smith in front
of the goal. “They pulled to-
last year,” Coach Leo
Bcmis said, “and we’ll have to do
the same on Saturday”,

The Panther booters owe their
consistent success to ;heir spirited
coach, Leo Bemis.

In 1939, Coach Bemis started
Pitt’s‘ first varsity soccer team.
Since that time, his teams have
performed at a consistent rate.
wining slightly over 60 percent
of their games. This record was
compiled with an independent.
intcrsectional schedule which
annually includes some of the
best college teams.

The record  an--exceptional
one because his squads have been
heavily populated by men who
were learning to play soccer for
the first time. Two of Pitt’s three
All-Americans and four of the
seven Most Valuable Players had
no prior experience.

Under the coach’s tutelage Pitt
teams have produced All—Amer-
icans Jerry Bresanelli,
Wyatt, and George Zanicopoulos.

Bemis received his B.S. de-
gree in Education from Edin-
boro State College in 1941.
While at Edinboro. he played
three years of football and was
a member of the baseball and
wrestling teams.

Following thirty-nine months
of Army service. he completed his
undegraduate and l\/[aster degree
studies at the University of Pitts-
burgh in 1947.

Kelvington May
Wrestle in 157

Pound Division

By BOB SMIZIK

Wrestling Coach Rex Peery may
be looking for a new man to grasp-
ple in the 137 pound division this
season even though Daryl Kelv-
ington, who handled the job with
near perfection the past two years,
is still on the team.

Pecry feels, th at “Kelving:‘v‘.)n
probably won’t be able to get
down to 137 pounds so we’ll have

koff will probably be at. 147
pounds."
Last year Kelvington started

the season at 157 but worked his

Ronald 1

King’s Crown

; O'Brien

,way down to 137 pounds by the
ifourth match. It. was while he was
iwrestling in the heavier categ‘0ry
ithat Daryl lost the first dual meet
,match of his collegiate career. He
éis also a two-time runner—up for
lthe Eastern title at 1.37 pounds so
the tcznn may suffer froi.n the
change of positions.
_ Baily Shines
, ll" sophomore Tom Baily lives
fup to the ability he has Slli~W€d
ithus far he could be a more than
fadequate replacement for Kelv-
ington. Baily holds a decision over
‘Zolikoff in an intra-squad meet. ~
Assuming the starting position

at 157 pounds will not be an
easy task for Kelvington. In his
road are two-year lettermen
Augie Arrigone, Bill Robb, Paul
Wilson and sophomore standout
Tim Gay. All of these boys
could try their skill at 167
pounds if Kclvington beats them
out.

Peery has been putting the
squad through strenuous workouts
with emphasis on fundamentals
;and running in an e-fi"ort. to get the
iboys in shape.

The battle for the intra-squad
championship will be decided to-
‘day when the Meyers meet the
EMartins. Monday will begin the
jcliminzitions to determine who the
regulars will be.
