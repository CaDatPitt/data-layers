Democracy of USSR’s altered elections questioned

By Mark I. Porubcansky

Associated Press Writer

MOSCOW (AP) —— A Russian
Orthodox Church leader is nomi-
nated in a country where be-
lievers have long been repressed.
Leading reformers are not chos-
en to carry out major reforms. A
faithful worker starts a protest
hunger strike.

This is the bewildering world of
Soviet campaigning, one-third of
the way into the race for the
March 26 elections.

It has raised questions about.

how much democracy there is in

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, Jonuory 23, T98?

By Erik Kridle
_Staff Writer

Rachel Brown was 10 years old
when her parents first discussed
sex with her. Soon afterward,
abortion was explained to her.
Today, she is _l3, in the eighth
grade and already a staunch sup-
porter of the pro—choice
movement.

Brown, along with several
other young women, carried the
lead banner in front of an estimat-
ed 1,500 pro-choice demonstra-
tors throughout the Downtown
Sunday en route to the Alleghe-
ny County Morgue.

Many of the marchers carried

Girl marches for future
right to legal abortions

coat hangers as a symbol of what V if
"they, feel abortions would be-

come if the U.S. Supreme Court
reversed its Roe vs. Wade deci-
sion and outlawed abortion.
When the marchers chanted
Brown chanted, and when they
were silent, she too fell silent.‘
Brown first heard about the
march when she attended a
women's action meeting at

During the march, the pro-

”~Pro—|ife, that's a lie. You don't

”When you march, I want you

by pro-life protesters holding

groups apart without incident.

Bundy confession fails to win execution stay

By Ron Word

Associated Press Writer

STARKE, Fla. (AP) - Serial
killer Ted Bundy took responsibil-
ity Sunday for two Idaho murd-
ers, continuing tearful Ilth-hour
confessions even though they
failed to bring him an execution
delay, officials said.

Idaho state Attorney General
Jim Jones said his chief investiga-
tor met with Bundy for about an
hour, and that the condemned
prisoner described two murders
he committed in Idaho about
1974 or 1975.

Bundy, who has been on death

lost an appeal to the U.S.

no other court he has turned to

. West Virginia law a
move for education

West Virginia lawmakers appear to have created an ef-
fective strategy to alleviate the high percentage of high

school dropouts.

so Not too long ago, the dropout rate in West Virginia high
schools reached 17.4 percent. Now, any high-school aged
West Virginian who decides to drop out of school will‘
find his or her driver's license revoked until he or she be-
comes 18. Students who are absent more than 10 days
during a semester can also have their licenses taken away.

So far, the law has been a success. One hundred of 380
students who lost their licenses this fall returned to school
during the first four months of the school year. Many states
.-ﬂthat have observed the West Virginia law in action are
considering enacting similar laws. . . v

West Virginia lawmakers have shown good common
sense by" creating this law. Driving is a valued privilege
among teenagers. Without it, their independence is greatly
reduced. Ironically, a life lacking in education produces
the same effect. This law targets a specific population of
young people who appear to lack the interest to remain
in school. By reinforcing school attendance through the
‘suspension of driving privilege, students are given a more

’tangible_ reason to continuetheir high school education.

The fact that a quarter of the dropouts in West Virginia .

returned to school after the enacting of the law serves to

endorse it. Hopefully, laws like this one will "appear around '

the nation, causing teenagers in all 50 states to think twice
before giving up on high school.

Something is definitely wrong;
all of a sudden (at least, during
the past three years or so), peace
is starting to break out, and the
planet Earth, with no known~im-
mune system for tranquility,
might not endure the shock.

Ever since former President
Ronald Reagan and Soviet
Secretary-General I Mikhail Gor-
bachev met in Geneva way back
in late -1985, the Cold War has
been sputtering to an end, not to
mention the various little _”hot
wars" which have been sprinkled
throughout the world.

The front-pag news, of course,

‘ is the ever-ne ring end of the

Cold War between East and
West. Indeed, Gorbachev has
been a wry fox, constantly seiz-
ing the political initiative by do-
ing things that should have been
done long ago —— freeing dissi-
dents, loosening state censorship
and destroying chemical
weapons — but I guess we'll take
what we can get. -

The INF treaty, which appears
to be working so far, has been a
major publicity coup for both
sides as well. The treaty rescued
Reagan from the Iran—Contra fias-
co and Gorbachev from every-
thing else.

But the new—found peace in

be selling them as ”used," but

‘who cares, right? It's pure profit.

I know this because I acciden-
tally left three brand-new books

for two minutes on Thursday

evening in Hillman library. They
were still in the plastic bag when

I wandered away, and when I‘

returned, the bag was empty.

I immediately informed the
librarystaff, and the following
day I gave the titles and authors’
names of the books to the Pitt
Book Center so that they could be
on the lookout for them. After a
few frustrating days of checking
with all of the book buyers, I
bought the books again at full
cost for $83.49. I_was angry and
broke, but at least I thought that
the criminal hadn't profited by his
or. her actions. At least not until
I found out that Your Campus
Store buys used books, and I

found my brand-new books sit- '
ting behind the store counter.’ .

» When I asked to see the books,
I found my Add/Dropand special
permission forms with my name

and social security number still in
one of the books. When I showed
the manager the receipts for the
books and my Pitt I.D., he said
the. best he could do wouldbe to
sell them -back to me. Another
man who works there actually
had the nerve to accuse me of ly-

ing about the theft of the books,

or having a roommate sell them
to the store so that I could go
back and retrieve them for free —
in spite of the fact that I had pur-
chased .the same books again. '

The manager said that it is not
unusual at this time of year for the
same person to come in three
days in a row selling brand-new
books as ”used,” and that occa-
sionally Your Campus Store will
confiscate them and detain the
person, but only if the cashier no-
tices that the books are on a sto-
Ien books list.

I immediately called the Cam-
pus Police, foolishly assuming
that possession of stolen goods is

and voted ”no” for continued

Angola is another scene where
tight, U.S.-led negotiations actu-
ally worked. The deal there is
based largely on faith, but the
treaty, which has been followed
so far, calls for a pullout of Cuban
troops by mid-1991. Other pro-
visions include the reduction of
South African forces in the neigh-

drinking. I accompanied the
officer to the store twice, spend-
ing about 45 minutes of my time,
only to ﬁnd out that there was
nothing that they could do, since
my name was not written in the
textbooks. The Campus Police
officer wrote a report about the‘
incident, and the store got to
keep my books.

I was noteven aware that it
bought books from students.
Your Campus Store certainly
does not go out of its way to de-

makes his living by selling low-

no ”Campus Store" without us,
the students, the store is willing
to make an extra buck buying our
stolen property. I

Africa must also cease military
aid to the anti-Marxist rebel force
known as UNITA.

Another site of a military with-
drawal is in Kampuchea. Viet-
namese forces are leaving after
having invaded 10 years ago to
oust the vicious Khmer Rouge
government. Word has it that
thanks to prodding by the Soviets,
the Vietnamese will be out by
1990. _

Even the People's Republic of
China refuses to be left out of this
peacetime free-for-all. A Sinc-
Soviet summit, the first in three
decades, is in the works. ‘

Finally, a fragile truce is still be-

ing cradled in the Middle East_

while Iran and Iraq concentrate
on their oil production instead of
each other’s military might.

But even with all these new de-
velopments in peace, there are
still just as many conflicts. The
Palestinian uprising is in its 14th
month. The IRA is sporadically
active in Ulster, likewise the Afri-
can National Congress in South

Providence prevails over punchless Pitt

Mondoy, Jlonuory 23, 1989

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

A lot of things happened Satur-
day night at Fitzgerald Field
House. Not many of them were
good for the home-standing Pitt
Panthers.

The Providence Friars came
into town riding a six-game los-
ing streak in Pittsburgh and a
tough loss to Big East rival

' Georgetown at home (80-77).

Pitt, on the other hand, was on a
two—game winning streak (99-91
against Oklahoma and a 73-64
win at Boston College) and
looked to be coming together af-
ter some early season losses.

»Well, everything changed as .

the Friars left with a 96-81
victory.

”We really kept our poise out
there,” Providence Coach Rick
Barnes said. ”gEverytime they did
something good, we answered it.
I think that was a big key for us.”

Pitt dropped to 9-7, 2-3 in the
Big East. PC improved its record
to 14-2 and 4-2.

Pitt did not play that badly
Saturday and probably could
have won the game.’ It was the
Friar defense in the second half
that won the game for them. In
the last 20 minutes, Pitt was held
to five field goals (two three-
pointers) and a total of 34 points.
Did Providence do anything
different defensively in the sec-
ond half?

”-Yeah,” Barnes said, ”we kept
fouling them, kept‘ putting them
on the line [Pitt was 20-23 from
the charity_stripe in the second
half, 33-39 for the game]. We
basically played man the whole

game; when we went to zone,‘

they hit a few outside shots.

’’I was really impressed with
our players; they've learned that
they have to play hard for 40
minutes, and they really stayed
with it. They deserve all the

' credit.”

Pitt started off quickly, jumping
out to a 7-2 lead with less than
three minutes gone in the game.
That was short—lived, though, as

. PC battled back, and the game
was close for most of the first half.

At the 15-minute mark, PC
made it all the way back wher
center Marty Conlan hit a three
pointer to tie thevgame at 11.

Guard Eric Murdock gave the Fri- .

ars the lead with a coast-to-coas
layup, but Bobby Martin was able
to answer with a bucket, and the
game was tied once again.

thews scored for Pitt and was
fouled in the process. The Pan-
thers took a three-point lead, and
the game seesawed between one
and three points for most of the
half. —
”We came out with a lot of in-
tensity,” Pitt's Brian Shorter said.
’’If we can play with that kind of
intensity for a full 40 minutes, we
are capable of playing with any-
one in the country."

The Panthers eventually
stretched their lead to seven
points when Rod Brookin hit a
three-pointer from the corner, but
Providence didn't roll over and
was able to come back.

With just one minute left,
Quinton Burton scored to give
PC a one-point lead. Pitt kept up
the intensity and Matthews
scored with just three seconds

left. Pitt went into halftime lead-
ing 47-46.

”We knew that we needed this
game, so we weren't that down
at halftime,” Murdock said.
”There was still a lot of time left.
Everybody knew what they had
to do, and they just did it.”

Pitt was paced by Shorter’s 24
points and 16 rebounds. The Fri-
ars were led in scoring by Carlton

Screen’s 21. Conlon led with

nine rebounds. »

_’’I thought that Providence
played very well,” Pitt Coach
Paul Evans said. ’’I thought their
guard play was excellent. I
thought we played poor_ly offen-
sively and not too [well] defen-
sively.”

Most of that was in the second
half, when the PC defense kicked
in and effectively shut Pitt down.

in the beginning of that ill-fated,

‘inal 20 minutes, it looked as if

the game would go down to the
wire. '

The teams ran up and down the
floor as the score teetered from
two points either way. Then, with
just under 13 minutes to play,
Abdul Shamsid-Deen wasfouled
by Shorter after scoring a basket.
He gave the Friars a one-point
lead, something they would not
relinquish the rest of the game.

’’I think wewere able to take
away their intensity in the second
half, and that was the game,”
Murdock said. '

Pitt started to make» mistakes on
the offensive side, and it gave PC
the chance to stretch their lead.
Once the Friars went up by 10 on
two Cal Foster free throws, Pitt

could never come within seven.

for the rest of the game.

”|t’s more mental than any-
thing else,” Pitt's Rod Brookin
said. ”You have to give them
credit, they kept us out of our

game and we couldn't get back.” '

The biggest Providence lead
was 16 points with undertwo
minutes to play. The game end-
ed with the Friars up by 15,
96-81.

’’We got back within seven,
and it looked like we could do
something; then they would run
the clock down and make the
shot,” Evans said. ”We didn't get
a good effort from a lot of
people.”

The Panthers have three road .3

and St. John's next Monday), and ,

the field (51.1 in the Big East) and
boasting an impressive'72.7 per-
cent from the line (80.8 in Big
East play). '

Saturday -night at Fitzgerald

for a team—high 21 points and
pulled down three boards in a
96-81 victory over Pitt.

”This game was definitely a big

 Pitt student Legal becoming a big

wig in women ’s bodybuilding game

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

”Minds and Bodies —— Co|legi—
ate Shining Stars” reads the head-
line of an article in this month's
Natural Physique magazine,
dedicated to the promotion of
drug—free bodybuilding.

Appropriately fixed on the fol-
lowing page, as well as on the
cover of the issue, is a photo of
Janet Legal, Pittsburgh's own
bodybuilding champion.

Legal, a 5-foot-5, 122-pound
senior in the industrial engineer-
ing department at Pitt, had "just
walked offstage after winning the
American Natural Bodybuilding
Conference's Championships on
Oct. 29, 1988, when N.P. Editor
Steve Downs approached her
about a possible story in an up:
coming issue. i

”But he didn't mention any-
thing about the cover,” said
LegaL '

When Legal heard from Downs

again, he said he wanted a wom-
an on the cover, and Legal ”was
the first person that came to
mind.”

It wasn't as if Legal appeared
out of nowhere, however. She
had won the ANBC New York
State title and walked off with the
Best Poser title at the same meet
two weeks before the Great Lakes
competition, and “had been in
seven previous competitions.

Legal also placed second in sin-
gles and won the mixed pairs ti-
tle with partner Andy Sebastian at
the Collegiate USA Champion-
ships in Manhattan in May 1988,
won her second Best Poser title
at the Great Lakes meet and won
the collegiate Pennsylvania title
at Penn State in March 1987.

N.P. flew Legal to Mount
Snow, Vt., where she posed
wearing current bodybuilding
fashions for a future issue of the
magazine and was photographed
for the cover shot in the snow of
Mount Snow.

Legal and co-poser for the
cover Brian Zatkoff spent an hour
posing in 30-degree weather as
the photographer searched for the
right shot. ‘

”When I finally see the cover,
it'll make that hour in the snow
worthwhile,” Legal told N.P.

The magazine was released last
Thursday, and Legal does feel
that her work has paid off.

’’I knew I wanted to be a com-
petitive bodybuilder when l was
competing in high gymnastics in
high school,” said Legal, who has
been working out steadily for
only 31/2 years.

But her first competition — the
Westmoreland Natural 3ody—
building Championships in"June
1986 — didn't go as planned; the
Penn Hills native didn't even
place,

’’I thought, ‘Oh, this is terrible!
How am I ever going to~be good
at competitive bodybuilding?’ ”
Legal said.

”But~it got me motivated to do
better.” ,

Legal, who has been a dean's
list student every term and is the
president of Alpha Pi Mu, the in-

dustrial engineering fraternity, got at

her start in bodybuilding at Trees
Hall as a freshman, where she
also was a supervisor. A

But as she became more seri-
ous about working out, Legal
joined the Exercise Warehouse in
Bloomfield and gained a sponsor
in Olympic Gym, owned by
Penn Hills resident Mary
Sullivan.

Legal works on a three—day spl‘it“9 -

Despite the rigor that some-

she could not dowithout work-

But not to dieting.

”out of shape,” weighs about

Lady gymnasts finish a farsecond A  

By lenna Hunter
Staff Writer

In their season opener, the
Lady Panthers hosted Ohio State
University and the University of
Michigan, finishing second with
a 175.95 total.

’’I truly thought we should
have opened up with a 180,”
said head coach Deb Yohman.

Yohman also said that there
were changes in the usual Pitt
lineup and some problems on
bars that brought the team's score
down. ‘

Pitt outscored Michigan's
173.5 total but couldn't surpass
Ohio State's 181.7.

”Ohio State's always good.
They're a strong team. They had
two strong all-arounds who real-
ly brought their team score up,”
Yohman said. _ V

Pitt started at vaulting, while

Ohio State started at the uneven
parallel bars. Freshman Jen But-
kovich attempted a layout tsuka-
hara (one of the hardest flipping
vaults seen at the collegiate lev-
el), but fell short and received an
average of 8.1.

Another freshman, Gina Vene-
zia, performed the same vault in
a tucked position with excellent
heightand a solid landing for a
9.05 average.

”Gina had a super vault,” Yoh-
man said.

Sophomore Kathy Wallish,
competing a new twisting vault
this year (full twist on, handspring

off), hit both vaults with good

landings for an 8.85 average.
Senior Trish Aser,’ known for

_her great form and consistency on

vaulting, had two good vaults
with perfect landings for an 8.9.

Another senior, Stephanie
Megill, performed a piked tsuka-

hara with great height, for exhi-
bition (which means the score
doesn't count toward the team to-
tal) and also scored 8.9.

The highest vaulting scores for
Pitt came from captain Shelly
Sleith and sophomore Carrie

Carnesale. Both received 9.15 for

their full-twist on/full-twist off
vaults.

Going into their second event,
the uneven parallel bars, Pitt only
trailed Ohio State by .35 points.
Ohio State led with a 45.45,
while Pitt had a 45.10 total.

Sleith led off for Pitt with a col-
legiate high bar score of 9.2.
Junior Hope Celani also hit a
good bar set with some minor
form breaks for an 8.5. Vene_zia
had a major break in her routine
when she failed to catch a release
move, dropping her score to a
7.65. Borchers also had some
major breaks in her routine, but

. 5‘ A '..' '
n ,

performed a great, solid dismount
for a total 7.8.
Carnesale picked up the slump,

hitting a good set with great A S

release moves, but some minor
form breaks brought her score
down to 8.4.

Butkovich swung through a -

fine bar set but only managed an
8.55 after landing short on a
tucked double—back fly-away
dismount. ‘

On balance beam, the Lady‘
. Panthers turned in some excel-

lent performances and showed
why they are so tough when it
comes to staying on the beam.

Aser started off with a steady,
clean routine for an 8.9. Borch-

ers and Butkovich each had good ‘
beam sets for an 8.55 and8.7_, ‘E

respectively.
Sophomore Tina Taylor and

Sleith each had one fall but.

Panther gymnasts outolistance James Madison

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
opened their 1989 season Satur-
day with a win overiames Madi-
son University at Trees Hall. The
Panthers scored 253.2 points,
while James Madison finished
with 209.6.

”The program looks good,”

 

said head coach Frank D’Amico.
”The guys looked OK. The scores
could have been higher, but the
rules have changed drastically

1 and the judges were feeling their

oats.”

”We did one thing today,” said
first-year assistant coach Jorge
Sanchez. ”We hit clean routines
without any serious injuries and
found the weak areas.”

Junior Pat Pollaci won the floor
exercise scoring a 9.15; freshman
Pat Murgolo was close behind,
scoring a 9.1. Junior Brock Freeh-
ling placed third for Pitt with an
8.75.

Juniorjorge Gonzalez received
a meet—high 9.5 for his perfor-
mance on the pommel horse. The
next two finishers for Pitt were
Freehling and Pollaci, who

received scores of 7.95 and 7.35,
respectively.

The top finishers for Pitt on the
rings were Murgolo (9.1), Gonza-
lez (8.75) and freshman David
Bausmith (8.7).

The same three Panthers had
the high scores on the vault. Gon-
zalez scored a 9.1, Murgolo
scored an 8.85 and Bausmith
scored an 8.6.

On the parallel bars, sopho-
more Damon DiFabio held top
honors for Pitt, scoring an 8.7.
Gonzalez was close behind with
an 8.6 and Freehling trailed
slightly, earning an 8.5.

The final event, the high bar,
was won by Gonzalez with a 9.2.
The next two Panthers were Pol-
laci, with an 8.85, and Bausmith,
with an 8.55.

In the individual all—around

     
 

 

competition, Gonzalez took first Q-
place, scoring a 53.5. ’
”l was happy with my perfor-
mance,” said Gonzalez. ”The
team showed a lot of potential. I
think we look good for the rest of
the season.”
”The pommel horse wasn't
what we wanted, but we came 4
- back on the last few events,” said
' Freehling. ”The freshmen kicked
 butt and the team spirit was ex-
. cellent.” ‘

going. I felt very confident
tonight, playing the whole
game.”

Saturday night’s game was
marked by many official and tel-
evision time-outs, giving the play-
ers more time to catch a breather.

”Those time-outs may be more
of a factor than we realize when
we're out there on the court,”
Screen said. ”The game did run
a little long, but we're so intense

like those extra time-outs last for
only five seconds. It probably al-
lows usto rest up without realiz-
ing it.” y ‘

The Providence full—court press
devastated the Panthers, especial-
ly in the second half. Friar pres-
sure forced costly Panther I
mistakes, as Pitt constantly turned‘
the ball over in futile attempts to
cross midcourt. “

"I think our press was a key for
us in the second half,” Screen
said.

”We didn't give them a lot of
open shots in the second half;
and I, think that was the
difference.”

Screen took over 12th place on
the Friars’ a|.l—time assist list after
Saturday night's game. His 247
career assists pushed him ahead
of Kevin Stacom.

Prior to Saturday's game,
Screen was third in the NCAA in
steals (3.9 per game). He had four

’Niners takeSuper Bowl on Ia

" By Dave Goldberg

 

AP Football Writer-

MIAMI — Joe Montana hit John
Taylor with a 10-yard touchdown
pass with 34 seconds left as San

' Francisco staked its claim as the

Team of the '80s Sunday witha
20-16 victory overCincinnati in

'the.most dramatic Super Bowl

even
”lt’s got to be one of our best

’ wins ever,” Joe Montana said.

”To be down by a field goal and
come back and win it like we did
 it's got to rank up there, believe
me.” .

The victory was achieved
through the brilliance of Joe Mon-
tana and Jerry Rice, who led the
49ers.

The winning score came at the
end of a 92-yard drive, en-
gineered by Montana, whose
touchdown pass gave him a Su-

' per Bowl record with 357 yards
‘ passing. Twelve of his comple-

tions were to Rice, who finished
with 12 catches for 222 yards,
both also records.

”You might as well forget the
great Denver drive that got them
into the Super Bowl. Now, it's the
great San Francisco drive that
won the Super Bowl,” Bengal
quarterback Boomer Esiason said.
”That indicates how great Joe
Montana is.”

It was the fifth straight win for

an NFC team, but by far the most‘

dramatic — the previous four had
been by an average score of
41-14.

It also gave coach Bill Walsh
his third Super Bowl win in 10
seasons as the 49ers coach. It

would be a fitting climax to a
career that may end this week
when the 57-year-old Walsh
could announce that he will step
down as San Francisco's coach.

The winning drive began after
Jim Breech had kicked his third
field goal _of the game, a
40-yarder with 3:20 left, to give
the Bengals a 16-13 lead. A.hold-
ing call on the kickoff forced the
49ers to start from their own 8
with a little more than three
minutes left.

But Montana, who was 23 of
36, made himself the quarterback
of the decade on the winning
drive. He passed for 8 yards to

Rice, 9 yards to tight end John .

Frank and 17 more to Rice. Then,
he hit Roger Craig for 13 yards
and hit Rice 27 yards over the
middle on a second-and-20 play.

After an 8-yard pass to Craig,
he hit Rice for 10 yards to set up
the winning score to Taylor.

The game that was supposed to
be a shootout went 44 minutes
and 26 seconds without a touch-
down, the longest dry spell in the
23 Super Bowls.

Then came two within 91
seconds.

After Mike Cofer’s 32-yard field
goal tied the game 6-6 for San
Francisco with 50 seconds left in
the third quarter, Stanford Jen-E
nings took the kickoff 93 yards for
a score, racing untouched
through the San Francisco
defense until Terry Greer ran him
down and tripped him as he fell
over the goal line.

But the 49ers, whose offense
sputtered, suddenly came to life,
going 85 yards in just four plays

to tie the score at 13-13. Montana
hitJerry Rice for 31 yards, Roger
Craig for 40, then Rice for a
touchdown in the left corner of
the end zone from 14 yards out.

The first half of what was sup-
posed to be a shootout ended
with the score tied 3-3 and each
team licking major wounds. It
was the first halftime tie in Super
Bowl history and the first without
a touchdown since Pittsburgh led
Minnesota 2-0 at halftime. 14
years ago.

The Bengals started without
backup fullback Stanley Wilson,
who was suspended by the
league about five hours before
the opening gun for what the
league simply called ”a violation
of the NFL’s substance abuse-
policy.” -

Then the Bengals suffered an
more severe losswhen All-‘Pro
nose tackle Tim Krumrie went out
with 8:06 left in the first period
with a fracture left tibia and fibu-
la. He was the second starter to
break his left leg in the first seven
minutes —— Steve Wallace, San
Francisco's left tackle, suffered a
broken tibia on the 49ers’ third
play from scrimmage.

But it could have been worse
for the Bengals — a 22-yard pass
from Montana to Mike Wilson
that was first ruled complete at
the two was overruled when
replay official Chuck Heberling

° ‘THE pm News, Monday, January 23, 1939

said Wilson never had pos-
session.

The Bengals tied it with 1:15
left in the half on Jim Breech’s
34-yard field goal following a
28-yard, six—play drive set up by
Barry Helton’s 37-yard punt.

Cincinnati got field position on
Barry Helton’s 37-yard punt after
a holding call against Cross, the
first penalty against San Francis-
co in almost six quarters, set the
49ers back to their own 10. It was
the second major error of the day
for the 49ers’ center, who retired
after 13-year career following the

' game.

The Bengals took the second-
half kickoff and despite five
penalties — five of them accept-
ed — used 9:11 to move from

their own 14 to the San Francis- ,

co 25 and set up Breech’s
43-yard field goal for a 6-3 lead.

The 49ers tied it at 6-all on
Cofer’s 32-yard field goal with 50
seconds left in the third period af-
ter Bill Romanowski tipped ‘an
Esiason pass, then intercepted at
the Cincinnati 23.

But Jennings came right back
with his kickoff return, the second
in Super Bowl history. The first
occurred in 1983, when Miami's
Fulton Walker returned a kickoff
98 yards for a score in a 27-17
defeat by Washington.

managed to score well with 8.65
and 8.35.

Venezia, who performed an ex-
hibition on beam, hit her routine
for a 9.2.

Carnesale had an excellent
beam set, hitting every skill for a
9.30.

Floor proved to be an exciting

‘event to watch due to a higher

level of difficulty and dance'ex-
ecuted in Pitt's routines.

Aser danced through a nice
floor set but had some problems
with her tumbling passes, scoring
lower than usual with an 8.25.

Sleith added a double twisting
layout to her routine and scored
8.75. Carnesale also performed a.
double-full in her first tunbling
pass, continued tumbling with

‘ great height and scored 8.95.

Wallish, who was Pitt's most
consistent floor performer last
season, showed that a clean rou-V 8
tine with good dance and medi-
um tumbling can pay off. She
scored a 9.2. ' ,

Taylor combined both difficult
tumbling, original dance moves
and flexibility for the highest
score for Pitt, a 9.25.

Celani performed "a new rou-
tine with some new tumbling

skills, for exhibition, scoring 8.1 

Although Yohman thought the
total team score was low, she was
pleased with the performances
and thinks that the team can only
improve with experience.

’’I could say something good

about everyone,” she said. ”They
are going to get better.” 0
