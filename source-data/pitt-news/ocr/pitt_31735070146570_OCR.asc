What do super computers have to
do with gubernatorial politics?
Plenty when you’re campaign-
ing in Allegheny County -— home
to Pitt, Carnegie Mellon and their
joint research venture, the Pitts-
burgh Supercomputing Center.
Allegheny County Executive
Dan Onorato spoke at the super-
computing center Tuesday in front
of a crowd of about 60, comprised
of mostly PSC staff and journal-
ists. He addressed one of his usual
campaign topics — translating
Pittsburgh’s economic success in
technology, education and green

jobs to the whole state —— a pitch he

3 has repeated often since the start
of his-campaign against state At- ’

torney General Tom Corbett.

The speech, held in the super-
computing center on South Craig
Street, demonstrated the county
executive’s knowledge of public
policy and lawmaking.

“We need to stay focused on
the sciences and mathematics, on
training the teachers’ teachers,”
Onorato said. “Organizations like
this are a big reason Pittsburgh has
survived the recession in relatively

- good shape. We’ve downsized the

[county] government and focused
on state—of-the—art industries and
facilities like this one under my
watch. That needs to happen at

the commonwealth level.”

After watching a number of
short 3D presentations given by
scientists about what the center

is doing to improve green tech— .

nologies, Onorato ﬁelded a range
of questions from the crowd be-
fore heading to another campaign
event. -

“We’re busting with educa-
tional resources,” Onorato said.
“We need to keep that in mind as
we work on the state budget and
every other issue. Education and
research cannot be lost. That much
is clear, even in the muddy waters
of Harrisburg.” ’

Onorato wasn’t the only one
asking for support during the
early afternoon event. The su-

percomputing center, which has
emerged as an authority on “clean
coal,” neurochemical research and
other topics, is looking to increase
its stateappropriations to $1.5 mil-'
lion per year, “in order to assure
its performance as Pennsylvania’s _
premier consulting, training and
networking computer facility,”,
according to a release put out by
the center.- .

That request comes after a two-
year slide in state and federal fund-
ing levels for the PSC. In the 2008-
09 ﬁscal year, appropriations fell
to $700,000. This year funding
has fallen to $180,000.

Pitt prof
on gas
drilling

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News.Editor

In what can hardly be called abarmer
year for energy companies, research-
ers and policy makers, including one
Pitt professor, have raised concerns
over the safety of drilling for natural
gas in the Marcellus Shale formation
in‘Pennsy1vania.

Conrad Dan Volz, an assistant
professor at Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health, directs the Center for
Healthy Environments and Commu-
nities. Founded in'2005, the center
includes Volz, four other members of
Pitt’s faculty and halfa dozen graduate
students and interns.

Volz said the center partly uses
community suggestions to direct its
research. Much of that research is di-
rected at the effects ofMarcellus Shale
drilling, but the centerhas other proj-
ects researching coal-ﬁre air pollution
and ﬁshery pollution in the state.

The center recently launched a
blog, fractracker.org, to track drilling
permits andthe issues around drilling
in Marcellus Shale, a rock formation
thatrunsunderparts ofwestvirginia,
Ohio, Pennsylvaniaand NewYorkstate
that contains trillions of cubic feet of
natural gas. V

Some of that gas escaped during a
well blowout in Clearﬁeld County, Pa.,
onjune 3, raising alarm ﬂags across
the state. The blowout releasedtens of

More state funds needed

Onorato < 1

a program that provides free high-perfor-
mance computer time to local educational
institutions.

Nathan Stone, a senior research analyst
for the center, said the loss of these programs
is extremely disheartening and detrimental
to the overall function and purpose of the
supercomputing center.

“Here at the PSC we are involved in vital
research about the spread of disease, like
H1N1, and research about how to better uti-
lize clean coal technology,” Stone said. “We
need the funds to make these kinds of studies
larger, to model clean coal plant function,
from the molecular level of burning coal to

it

the productivity of the whole factory.”

Stone’s assessment might be right. Earlier
work by the center led to breakthroughs
in the understanding of hepatitis C, deep
water ocean currents and Brownian mo-
tion -— the seemingly random motion of
subatomic particles suspended in a liquid
— to name a few. C

“We need the money to leverage addi-
tional federal dollars as well, and we can’t
get that money without a larger contribution
from the state,” Stone said. “Times are hard.
We understand that, but our work here is not
something that Pennsylvania or our country
can go without.”

much more likely near a populated area, Volz
said. Safety concerns had arisen before the Clear-
ﬁeld incident, but the blowout brought the topic
to the foreﬁ‘ont of the Marcellus Shale debate.
Volz said he thinks the blowout is indicative
of larger issues in Pennsylvania drilling.
A “There are problems in this entire industry

that haven’t been entirely addressed,” he said. ’

The environmental and public health effects
of air pollution, wastewater disposal and drill-

ing on local watersheds still need ﬁirther study,

Volz said. '

vocates on behalf of many natural gas drilling
companies in Pennsylvania, did not respond to

legislature about drilling run the gamut from a

Sex pill,

' hether you are a woman
who ﬁnds herselflacking
‘sexual desire or a man

having trouble getting his gal to
horizontal tango, there’s now a pill
to increase female sex drive.

Developed by the German drug
company Boehringer Ingelheim,
the “little pink pill” treats.hypo-
active sexual desire disorder by
altering compounds in the brain
to boost female libido.

But last week, the pill failed to
gain recommendation for approval
by a Food and Drug Administration
panel.Viagra is used to treat men
with erectile dysfunction, but there
doesn’t seem to be such a clear-
cut diagnosis for a sexual desire
disorder in women. _

There is then a question of
whether a pill is even necessary
or effective. _

It seems more likely that ﬁnan-
cially motivated drug companies
are trying to create a problem so

no thrill

that they can treatsit, but does. it
work?

According to CNN, “women
taking the pill reported that ‘sexu-

. ally satisfying events’ increased

to about 4.5 a month, while those
taking a placebo reported about
3.7 such events.” It is also noted
that the “events” did not need to
include an orgasm.

, Because there is such a vague

deﬁnition of what constitutes a

sexual desire disorder in women,
there seems to be no medical rea-
son for a pill that treats it. We have
to wonder if the women willing
to buy this pill have exhausted all
other alternatives, including ther-
apy, lubricants, arousal devices or
new partners.

It’s more likely that women
look for a magic pill to solve their
problem in the sheets than actually
look for a cure to a sexual desire
disorder, and if so, they’ll probably
be disappointed.

rom training Residant As-
Fsistants to managing hous-

ties across the United States now

Outsourcing can be cheaper and

I ing from these third-party vendors
in the past few years, The Chronicle '

of Higher Education reports.

But outsourcing certain ser- I

vices does more than just displace
university jobs. Services requiring
direct involvement and interaction
with students should especially
be kept under a school’s manage-
ment.

Even after assuming a company
providing a service can do so effec-
tively, relegating drug prevention
advice, for example, doesn’t help
build a student’s relationship with
his school.

Keep it in-house

Outside providers also work
mainly by contract. Should some-

‘ thing go awry or there’s a disagree-

ment from either party, making

changes is more difficult when mul-

tiple organizations are involved.
Still, it’s too much to label all

_third—party,vendors as detrimental

to a school’s operations. If a com-
pany can properly process data or
surveyed information —- a third-
party service that’s more removed
from direct student interaction --
it could be a worthy investment.

Yet, once third parties become
the primary providers, so much for
administrational school spirit. To
students, too many non—in—house
services could make a school feel
like a shopping mall of services
rather than a cohesive educational
institution.

counselors for students and has

niently awaiting calls at any hour.
Fortunately, Pitt doesn’t seem
awash with outsourced operations,
and hopeﬁllly that won’t change.

Why one writerdoesn’t mind having a small chest

 
   

Lexie Bond
Asst. Opinions Edi-tor

Allow me to state the obvious: I ,

have no boobs. Not small boobs —
no boobs. In fact, where my boobs
are supposed to be, there are actu-
ally dents in my chest.

OK, I'm exaggerating about that
last part, but not by much.

I realize I’m not alone in the
world, and that I actually have some
great “boobless” company: Kate
‘Hudson, Keira Knightley, Cameron
Diaz and Natalie Portman.

Despite this excellent company,

the only company to which‘I ever I

compare myself or get compared
by others is family, mainly my sis-
ters. '
Now, how do I put this politely?
Both of my sisters are extremely

well endowed in the chest region.
What makes matters more difficult
is that one of my sisters is three
years younger than I am.

' When she surpassed me in bra
size, I didn’t panic. Everyone always
told me that I would just wake up
one morning and BAM! I’d have
boobs. “Just watch, Lexie,” they

. would say, “you’ll be bigger than

all of us.”

After about 12 years of wak-
ing up in the morning only to ﬁnd
that I hadn’t magically sprouted
any melons — or even grapefruits
would be nice — I’m ﬁnally giving
up at the age of 21. This is as big as
they will get. .

I’ll admit that my breastlessness
wouldn’t bother me so much if it
weren’t for my sisters and my con-
stant comparison tothem.

For years I’ve worn bras that
are too big for me, just to give the

illusion that something is there.
That’s right — I live a lie. This ends
up being a cruel joke for boys who
eventually discover the truth. Their
confusion and disappointment are
almost as bad as mine when I con-
template my DNA.

I’ve come to the conclusion that
my sisters hogged all the boob
genes, along with the good sing-
ing genes.

Other than living my lie, I have
found I didn’t have many options.
Can you imagine my disappoint-
ment when my boobs didn’t get big-
ger after I went on birth control‘?

Convinced that the hormones
in cow’s milk would make my
boobs bigger, I started drinking
three glasses per day. This prob-
ably wouldn’t seem so desperate if
I wasn’t lactose intolerant.

SOME UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

 

The components of a proper complaint

 
  
 

Jacob Brown
Columnist

I’ve read my share of angry feed-
back in my day. From letters in
response to my columns in this
newspaper to news stories about
hotheaded politicians battling
amongst one another, exasper-

ated emotions often-are the

strongest when carried out in a
format frequently deemed one of
the most cordial: the letter. If only
people knew how to effectively ex-
press all that pent-up rage. When
I was asked to read one recently
regarding a service complaint, I
saw all the familiar folly.

If I were the CEO of the com-
pany that received this letter, I
would have just deleted it from
my Blackberry without a second
thought. It was atrocious. True,
not everyone is an English ma-
jor, so I could forgive occasional
lapses in spelling or grammar. But

seeing as I am an English major
and my ﬁngers have punched out
their fair share of venom-spewing
ire, I feel I’m pretty well qualiﬁed
to critique the process.

While a letter should be an un- A

relenting piece of the most venge-
ful vitriol you can think of, it has
to have an immediate purpose.
For best results, it’s important to
stick to the most essential points
of interest. The letter this fed—up
customer wrote was all over the
place, mentioning issues ranging
from the way he was supposedly
treated to what employees were
wearing.

Next —— and this should be
obvious — be professional and
polite. Name calling is a bit child~
ish to be taken seriously. If you’re
planning on being mad at an indi-
vidual, using a subtle allusion to
poke fun at his or her ineptitude
is not only more fun, but it’s often
more effective than using offen-
sive slurs. But that takes both a
level of foresight and cleverness

- with the English languagethat

most peoplejust don’t have. Being
polite and upset with someone
or something do not have to be
mutually exclusive. ’ '

From there, some semblance
of organization should lead the
aggrieved party to a point where
or he or she should have built up
a sturdy case of justiﬁed rage,
thus making any caring profes-
sional more than willing to right
any wrong. Now, we’re at a point
of trying to ﬁgure out what the
reparations will be.

This can be anything from an _ E

apology to free stuff, depending
on how far you’re willing to drag
it out. Often, there’s ‘a time value
or money factor that should be
considered.

When my MP3 player broke
while under warranty a few
months ago, I returned to the
store to discover that they no lon-
get carried the particular bundle
I had. I could have argued with
them to throw in the case and the

specialty headphones that were
now extras —— and likely could
have gotten them to give them
to me at no extra cost — but the
difference was only $7, so I swal-
lowed my pride and paid the dif-
ference.

On the other hand, when my
brother recently called the manu-
facturer of his GPS to express his
displeasure over a defective prod-
uct, the company gladly upgraded
his podunk GPS to a model worth
twice as much without hesitation.
It never hurts to ask what options
are available to rectify a situa-
tion. ,

In all of this, the last and most
important step to consider is to
use the chain of command prop-
erly. Even if some heated letter
gets the attention of the CEO of
a multi billion-dollar company,
what’s that going to accomplish
in the long-run?

The best place to start iswith
a direct manager —- someone
with immediate authority. From

there, if that person continues to
blow you off, work up the ladder.
Rinse, lather, repeat. You’re sure
to ﬁnd someone who gives a damn
eventually. -

With enough -ardor and as-
sertiveness, anything is possible.
While one can try to milk the sys-
tem dry, anyone in management
with a semblance of perceptive-
ness should be able to tell a le-
gitimate grievance from that of
a freeloader.

But even if the customer is
wrong, “the customer is always
right}? Businesses with practical
sense understand that concept.
And as that’s the case, ‘with rela-
tively little effort and some man-
ners, ﬁnding an amicable solution
should never be an issue of “if,”
but rather “to what degree.”

“True Life: I hate my small breasts.”
I thought some plastic "surgeon
might take pity on me and give me
an augmentation for free. Unfortu-
nately, I didn’t get cast.

But I had to wonder, would sili-
con make me feel better? Sure, they
would look bigger and maybe fool

‘‘“’other people, but they wouldn’t fool

me. They would still be a lie, just
like my oversized bras and the tube-
socks I might shove in them. Was it
even my small chest that was mak-
ing me upset, or just the fact that I

had been genetically cheated?

Finding areas to measure

Besides, what am I really miss-
ing out on? Some might even con-
sider me lucky. No complications
come with small boobs, except for
not being able to ﬁll out certain ar-
ticles of clothing.

Large breasts, on the other
hand, can lead to back problems
and bad posture, in addition to
eventual unsightly saggage, not to
mention I will never have to worry
about being slapped in the face by
my own bosom while running.

I will undoubtedly be crept on
far less by men than women who

' have large chests, and whilerny face I
g has to be much nicer to compen-
 sate, I luckily wasn’t swindled in
the facial region —-— this mug was

carved by angels.

If I’ve learned anything from
having small breasts, it’s the time-
less lesson that life :isn?trfair.’I might
feel like I’m missing out on some of
the curvy glory of being a woman,
but I will never have to triple layer
my sports bras ‘before I exercise.
While my boobs willlnever get me
out. of a speeding ticket or into ‘a
club, I luckily don’t have that ex-

tion on improvements to my body

tra 10 pounds to carry around that
busty beauties do.

I’ve also been forced, through
the negative comments about my
small breasts by others, to be conﬁ-

dent and secure in myself and other '

parts of mybody. I might have a ﬂat
chest, but I’m damn-vproud of my
legs — and being awoman.

WYEP’s music festival hits Oakland

The 13th annual WYEP Summer Music Festival features folk music, crafts and kids activities.

Kelsey Shea
A 8' E Editor

Local radio station WYEP will take the mu-
sic it plays from theairwaves to the grass
blades this week with its 13th annual Sum-
mer Music Festival in Schenley Plaza.

The plaza will host a slew of folk .per-
formances, an artists market and kids’
activities for mini music lovers.

WYEP marketing director Jessica Ro-
mano said the kids activities are a new
addition to the festival, as a part of an ef-
fort to make it more of an event than a
concert.

“We’re expanding every year, and we
saw it as an opportunity to make the fes-
tival more family friendly,” Romano said.

“We thought why not engage them in this
new way?”

. All and all, Romano expects a great
festival this year. The impressive lineup
includes headliner Nicole Atkins and the

Black Sea, folk singers Sarah Harmer and
JoshJackson and local jam band The Boo-
gie Hustle.

Romano said WYEP chooses its bands

Jessica Romano:

for the festival by lookingat what they’ve
been playing most, what their listeners
seem to like and what’s “a little different
and what’s fresh.”

“We want people to know what kind of

music is out there,” she said.

In addition to the live music, the side
lawn of the Carnegie Library will host the
I Made It! Market as part of the festival. I
Made It! is a local organization that brings

together crafters, offering them space in
nomadic markets, where they can sell their
goods.

They will hold another, larger market
in Schenley Plaza later in the year, on Sept.
21 and 28.

Nicole Atkins
and The Black
Sea
9:40 p.m. J

  

This year’s headliner, Nicole Atkins, has
a ﬂair for drama. Her gloom-and-doom-
sounding music backs up her clear Jenny
Lewis-like vocals to create a powerful com-
bination.Jersey—born Atkins is somewhat of
a staple on in indie rock. Her career started
in North Carolina, where she made connec-
tions with other bands like the Avett Broth-
ers, before moving to New York, and ﬁnding

. her place on the Manhattan music scene.

Sarah Harmer,
8:30 p.m. J

Opening performer Sarah Harmer will bal-
ance out Atkins and her stormy weather
with sunshine and perky, acoustic folk
music. The Canadian singer—songwriter
has been playingmusic since the mid—’90s,
but her latest album Oh Little Fire, which
came out Tuesday, will be her first album
in five years. -As well as performing her

own music, she’s also sung backup for N eko V

Case, Howie Beck and Great Lake Swim-
mers. Her music is light, clever and easy to
listen to. You can check out her cute single,
called “One Match,” off Oh Little Fire on
her website sarahharmer.com.

Joshua James

7:15 pm.

Folk singer Joshua James’ most distinct
characteristic is his voice. Low, husky and

Itwinged with a Southern accent, James’

voice runs smoothly over blues guitars
and Southern strings. His music hangs
somewhere between a Bob Dylan and a
Neil Young style. James’ latest album Build
Me This was released in 2009 and is the
follow—up to his critically acclaimed debut

album, The Sun Is Always Brighter.

The Boogie
Hustlers

The Boogie Hustlers is a local jam band that
sounds like it was meant to play outdoor
music festivals. It has a cool and upbeat
sound that mixes soul with pop, rock with
jazz and plenty of other clever combos. The
usual nine members — they’re always open
to bringing on temporary guest members
— have been jamming around Pittsburgh
for the past seven years. Local it might be,
The Boogie Hustlers is known outside of
Pittsburgh, as well,'and the band travels
up and down the East Coast.

ALBUM REVIEW

The Gaslight shines again

Kelsey Shea
A 8? E Editor

A lot of contemporary bands try to mimic
an older vein of music, and sadly,.it usually
doesn’t work.
But for The Gaslight Anthem, it’s where
thesejersey Boys have found their niche.
The band’s second album American
Slang sticks to the band’s fast and ener-
getic pace without sacriﬁcing the classic
Bruce Springsteen-style rock that helped

 

The Gaslight Anthem make a name for it-
self on its popular album, The ’59 Sound.

It might be Brian Fallon’s fantastic lead
vocals or Benny Horowitz’s crazy fast
drumming that sets The Gaslight Anthem
apart from other nostalgic rockers, but
it’s also the jarring honesty in the band’s
Americana lyrics and earnestness.

Like The ’59 Sound before it, American
Slang is the kind of album that makes lis-

The doubtable  

documentary tren

Maybe—real, maybe-not trend takes over theaters.

Andy Tybout
Assistant A & E Editor

A word of warning to documentary lovers:
you might have to hire your own private
investigator before you can enjoy your
favorite genre again.

This summer’s “Exit Through the Gift

. Shop” — the story of a French shopkeeper

who follows street artist Banksy around
and eventually, with Banksy’s endorse-
ment, becomes a famous street artist
himself — is just the latest in a series of
maybe—real, maybe-not documentaries
sweeping the nation.

The film piqued journalists’ skepticism
for several reasons: 1. the shopkeeper,
Thierry Guetta, is so over-the-top it’s hard
to imagine him as a real person, 2. Banksy,
the director, is a prankster to put your

roommates to shame and 3. the ﬁlm’s story.

is,,at best, unlikely.

But as mentioned, “Gift Shop” is only
the most recent ﬁlm to capitalize on its
own ambiguity — perhaps catalyzed by
“The Blair Witch Project” (1999) — so-
called “documentaries” have boosted
themselves in the public spotlight because
of their squeamishness with fact.

To some, this evasiveness may seem
inane: what, exactly, would be the problem
with labeling these ﬁlms “dramas?” Why

- the assertions of validity? The cynical an-

swer —- the answer cited when discussing
more crass stunts, like last November’s
supposedly true story, “The Fourth Kind”
— is that it draws attention, and conse-
quently, sales.

Purporting to be based on actual events,
and interspersing supposedly “real” foot-
age with a “dramatization,” “The Fourth

Kind” tells the story of an Alaskan doctor ‘

teners want to drive fast and enjoy being
a young 20-something.

Though American Slang is still ener-
getic and powerful, some of the songs seem
to have slightly lower ﬁdelity, and the en-
tire album is only slightly mellower than
The ’59 Sound.

One of the highlights of the album are
its title song, “American Slang,” which is

a dramatic and fast yet somehow nearly ’

ballad-like song that shows off the band’s
slight deviation from its last album, with-
out losing the spark that set it on ﬁre.

Other highlights include the upbeat
“Stay Lucky” and the rhythmic and in-
sanely catchy “Boxer.” «

On the whole, The Gaslight Anthem has
once again delivered its fans a fantastic
album that will hopefully precede many
others.

Ashton Gibbs is continuing his sharp shooting in the Pro—Am summer league. The Panthers

are taking part in games held at the Greentree SportsPlex throughout the summer.

Summer league
is heating up

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Basketball season won’t ofﬁcially
start for a few more months, but
fans can get an early look at the
2010-11 Panthers, including in-
coming freshmen, this summer.

The team will play in the Pitts-
burgh Basketball Club Pro—Am
Summer League, which is made
of six teams featuring current and
former athletes from Pitt, Robert
Morris and Duquesne, as well as
top players from local Division II
and Division III schools.

They will play on Mondays
and Wednesdays at the Greentree
SportsPlex.

“We’ve been waiting all year for
summer league to come around,”
Pitt sophomore Dante Taylor said.
“It’s an opportunity for us to get
better and show what we did in
the offseason.”

For Pitt fans, the league pro-
vides the ﬁrst look at incoming
freshmen]._]. Moore and Cameron
Wright, who enrolled at Pitt on
Monday.

Moore, a small forward from
Long Island, N.Y., is ranked No. 8
at his position by Scout.com, and
is the Panthers’ highest ranked
recruit. There was doubt whether
Moore would be eligible because of
academic reasons, but was cleared
to play this week.

Wright is a 6-foot—4 guard from
Cleveland. Scout.com ranks him
the No. 74 recruit in the country.

Pitt redshirt sophomore guard
Travon Woodall said the league
provides a good opportunity for
new players to acclimate to the
team.

“It’s a chance for us to see how
they are, and at the same time,
they get the chance to see how we
play and how tough we play and
how hard we play on a day—to—day

‘A nation of sports junkies’: America’s addiction

This is the second part of a series that explores how some fans take love for their team one step further

Tonyjovenitti

Assistant Sports‘Edi-tor -

”"Editor’s note: This is the second
of a three—part series taking an
in-depth look at the psychology
of sports fans.

Ron Steedle was in a hurry. He
left his job selling wallpaper in East

--'sLiberty at 5 p.m. He ran errands,

which included stops at home and
his mother’s house, and then he
headed Downtown. He needed to
be there by 6:30 and beat the rush-
hour trafﬁc.

When he ﬁnally made it Down-

7town, he hurried into Mellon Are-
na and took a seat.

When the chaos of his day set-
tled, he soon found himself out of
his seat and celebrating — with
17,000 others.

ute into the game, and from his
seats in the F level, where fans can

. ‘ - \ \ . .

literally touch the roof, Steedle felt
the joy of witnessing his team score
in front of the home crowd. ‘ ~
But that nosebleed joy costs
him $2,200 per year, and chaotic
days are the norm. Steedle is one

' of the few Pittsburghers with Pen-

guins, Pirates and Steelers season
tickets.

Starting in April, he attends
a game nearly every other night
when the Pirates start playing
again.

He dreads the few occasions
in which his inability to be in two
places at once means he has to skip
a Pirates game to attend a Pen-
guins playoff game. Last year, the
Penguins played well into June as
the team made a run to win the
Stanley Cup. Because of this, Stee-
dle was only able to make it to 73
of the Pirates’ 81 home games last
year, though he made it to every
Penguins and Steelers game.

He is certainly dedicated to

Pittsburgh sports, but he refuses
to call himself a fan.

 - “-I hate-the»woi=d-‘-fan.’ It’sshort~ ~ «

for fanatical,” he said. “I’m devot-
ed, but I’m not fanatical.”

He doesn’t go crazy in the
stands. He simply enjoys the game
because he loves sports. The deﬁ-
nition of “fan” might be debat-

able, but the presence of sports
P in society is not.

Sports are a focal point in
American society, and the sport-
ing industry is one of the most ro-
bust and wealthy in the country.
They are omnipresent in our lives.
Think of all the references in non-
sports-related conversations —
“The president came out swinging
today ...” or “She knocked it out of
the park with that performance.”

But if sports are just games
for grown-ups, is there a point
where a constant focus on games
becomes detrimental? Ken Boas,
who teaches a Literature of Sports

class at Pitt, said society has al-
ready reached that point.

-- -I=Ie—s-aid-he doesn’t think the"

gamesgthemselves are the prob-
lem, but the consumerism that has
developed over the years which
has turned America into a “nation

of sports junkies.”

“Many people in this country
are discontented,” he said. “They
are in debt, repressed at work and
just trapped. Sports become like a
drug,” he said. “We can’t ﬁnd the
satisfaction we crave in our own
lives, so we turn to sports.”

But he understands why these
“sports junkies” love athletics.
Boas enjoys sports himself.

“We get to see the purity of hu-
man potential being realized,” he
said. “The perfection of physical
form in a game we all know is a
vicarious pleasure. When you are
watching, you are locked into this
moment of perfection.”

Boas grew up playing baseball

’ and football, and he still loves to

watch a good ball game. He has

-"attended Pirates games/his whole‘

life, including when the team
played at Forbes Field.

“I still love the purity of the
game, but they make it very hard,”
he said, citing the many problems
of sports — which he teaches in
his class.

Students are often surprised to
learn his Literature of Sports class
isn’t all happy endings and buzzer
beaters. The day of this interview,

Boas was preparing to teach his *

class about racism in baseball. He
also discusses the media’s role in

sports.
~ “The media has such control
over what teams are able to do,”
he said, adding that this is what
leads to the drug-like culture of

sports.
There are more sports and
more all-sports channels. The me-

FOOTBALL

Open— air conditioning

Panthers spend time at Schenley Park to get in shape.

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The season might be more than two months
away, but you can still ﬁnd the Pitt football

A V team hard at work.

‘ That is, if you wake up early enough.

The team gathers at its South Side facil-
ity four days per week at 6:45 a.m. to work
on improving its strength and conditioning
over the summer. .

Mondays and Thursdays consist of some

.. 7-on-7 drills led by the quarterbacks, fol-

lowed by speed drills and lifting.

Tuesdays and Fridays are all about run-
ning and improving endurance, and accord-
ing to the players, no drill has been harder
than running the dreaded Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park for the ﬁrst several Fridays.

“The hill is the rough one because.» it’s
not that you’re out of breath —- it’sjust that
your legs go into meltdown,” senior guard
Chris Jacobson said.

Now that the hill runs are over, the team
does aworkout called “one minute—two min-
ute” every Friday.

» In that drill, players have to run anywhere
from 230 to 315 yards, depending on their
position, in less than a minute and then get
a two-minute break before repeating it.

Because of NCAA regulations, position

coaches can’t be present at these olfseason

workouts, leaving strength and conditioning
coach Buddy Morris in charge of preparing
the team for training camp in August.

“I really think he’s preparing us for the
season,” senior receiver Greg Cross said.
“In the fourth quarter and overtime, when
we’re well conditioned, we won’t think about
being tired. We’ll just go out and play and
perform.”

Cross — who is coming offspring work-
outs in which he was named the team’s most
improved offensive player. He andjacobson

have been two of the most impressive players 1

this summer.

“I’m in there to work hard because that’s c

what coach always says gives us an edge,”
Jacobson said.

Cross said there were too many guys to
list who have been impressive so far this ,1
summer, but he also said players coming

roles this year are cornerback Antwuan Reed

’ —— the spring’s most improved defensive ' I

player -—— and receiver Mike Shanahan. -

“Mike is my guy,” Cross said. “Mike
helped me out quite a bit, and he’s been
working hard.”

These workouts are also a good time for
the older players to lead some of the young
players by example — something the veter-
ans said helped them a few years ago.

“You want to lead them the right way, like
I had withjohn Malecki. I looked up to him
and Robb Houser andjoe Thomas,”Jacobson
said. “You need that on a team.” 1

this sports demand, he said, leading to an
even higher demand. This creates an endless
cycle of increasing supply and demand.
But sports psychologist Stephen Russo
said calling sports a drug is a little ex-
treme.
Russo, a former Pitt professor, works as
the director of sports psychology at Nova
Southeastern University in Fort Lauder-

dale, Fla. He said a drug addiction implies P

that there is a dependency. There are often
emotional responses to wins and losses, but
these are because of allegiances and iden-
tity, not because of dependency, he said.
~ “There is a long history in the human
experience of watching and spectating,”
Russo said, citing ancient Roman chariot
races and Greek Olympiads. ,
In modern times, he said, fans take it
one step further and start to identify with
athletes and teams. .
“People literally have an identity with the
team,” he said. “They feel like they are more
involved than they actually are.”

r Think of the use of the word “we.” Fans _

 

frequently say “we won” rather than “they

. won.”

“People feel better when the team wins
and the opposite when the team loses,”
he said. a

This is a natural response, but the
strength of the response comes down to
how strongly fans identify with the team.
Russo even offered an explanation as to
why Pittsburghers identify so strongly with
the Steelers. ’ a

“The very name of the Steelers means a
lot. There’s a historical connotation of the
steel mills and all the things that transpired
in that city,” he said- ,

He said studies have proven people’s
happiness and satisfaction can be linked
to the outcome of a game.

“When their teams don’t succeed, they
feel negative about not only things associ-
ated with sports but things in their life, as
well,” he said, and those emotions can be
somewhat addictive, which is one of the
reasons people return to sports.

Steedle keeps coming back. He has

basis,” he said. “It.gives us a good feel for
what’s going to happen in the future.”
Pitt’s third recruit, guard Isaiah Epps,

. won’t enroll until August.

The teams played three games on Mon-

ddgay, featuring standout performances from

several Pitt players, including Moore and
Wright.

Center Court 65, P&W Motors 63
The ﬁrst game of the night came down
to the ﬁnal seconds, but Robert Morris’
Karon Abraham missed a 3-pointer for P&W
on the ﬁnal possession of the game to seal
the victory for Center Court, led by Pitt’s
Ashton Gibbs and].J. Richardson.
Center Court led by double digits in the
second half, after taking a 30-24 lead into
(ghe break, but P&W clawed its way back into
the game with help from Abraham, who
scored 13 points.
But Center Court held on for the win.
Pitt fans saw a familiar performance
from Gibbs in the second half. Finding
his shot, he hit all of his 3—pointers in the
tight second half to ﬁnish with 17 points
and went 6-13 shooting, including 3-6 from
the 3-point line.
Richardson showed good touch around
the basket, adding 11 points and pulling
down ﬁve rebounds.

UPMC 75, Lair 67

The point guards stole the show in the
second matchup of the night, with Woodall
facing off against Duquesne commit T.J.
McConnell.

The Lair jumped out to an early lead,
thanks mostly to McConnell, who scored
20 points and added eight rebounds and
four assists.

But Woodall took control and brought
UPMC back as he scored 15 points and
dished out ﬁve assists. He guided UPMC
to a to a 37-28 halftime advantage and shot
6-13 from the ﬁeld and 2-4 from the 3-point
line.

“It felt good,” Woodall said. “It was the
ﬁrst time out there playing the game with of-
ﬁcials and everything. We’re good to go.”

Taylor did his part for UPMC on the in-
side, and the Lair didn’t have an answer for
the center. He controlled the glass, scoring
17 points and grabbing 13 rebounds.

“For the ﬁrst time, I thought I played
pretty good — rebounded, ran the ﬂoor,”
Taylor said. “I just tried to come out and
play the game — not do too much. I tried
to come in and incorporate the things that
I did, the things that I worked on.”

Gilbert Brown was aggressive in the
Lair’s losing effort, but struggled to ﬁnd
his shot, ﬁnishing 6-26 from the ﬁeld and

scoring 16 points. Talib Zarifna also played
for the Lair and was 6-10 from the ﬁeld,
scoring 13 points.

SPK Law 69, PGT 59

The ﬁnal game of the evening was prob-
ably the most anticipated for Pitt fans, as it
featured Moore for SPK Law and Wright for
PGT. The two met to expectations.

Moore came out ﬁring, scoring many of
his 13 points in the early going. He ﬁnished
4-7 from the ﬁeld and showedhis shooting
range in hitting both of his shotsfrom the
3-point line. I "C

Wright led PGT with 16, going 8-15 from
the ﬁeld. A ‘

Brad Wanamaker was one of the most

impressive players of the night, stealing, .
the limelight from the-incoming;freshmetf1‘ ,

as he scored from all over the ﬂoor;-Heiléd

and offered two assists. _

Wanamaker’s play was instrumental to
"SPK, stretching its lead in the second half
to put the game out of PGT’s reach.

Nasir Robinson reached double ﬁgures,
as well, with 11 points.

Lamar Patterson scored 13 points, and
Gary McGhee added a double—double with
12 points and 12 rebounds in PGT’s losing
effort. ‘

Prof says sports are a 
‘microcosm’ of society.

Sports 4 11

volved in sports since he was a
child growing up in the ’60s. He
said he hails from “the greatest
generation in Pittsburgh sports

history.”

“I’ve witnessed all the Super
Bowls, all the Stanley Cups and
almost all of the World Series
championships,” Steedle said.

He started coaching baseball
when he was in high school. He
coached for 38 years, and he
coached youth hockey for 31
years. He was also an umpire
throughout that span. He’s held
season tickets all the while, and
based on his calculations, he has
attended more than 2,000 games
between the Penguins, Pirates and
Steelers.

Steedle doesn’t “totally dis~
agree” that sports are addictive,
although he doesn’t put himself in
thesports—addicted category.

He said he prides himself in
not letting his. emotions get the
best of him at games.

“Having gone to so many

games, when crunch time comes
in a championship game or some-
thing, I keep control of my emo-
tions,” he said. “I don’t live and
die with the wins and losses,
but some people get a little too
worked up.”

Steedle admitted that he did
overreact when he was younger,
but he became “more jaded” as
he aged. _

“You see athletes committing
felonies and still getting paid mil-
lions of dollars,” he said. “Then
you realize that they are ﬂawed
human beings just like everyone
else.”

He does, however, admit to
one addiction: commitment.

Steedle has no kids, is single
and has never married, but he is
committed to “going the whole 9
yards with the team.”

“When I spend money for sea-

son tickets, I’m committed,” he '

said. “I don’t buy tickets just to
sell them. I buy them to go to the
games.”

Boas warned against this kind
of commitment.
“People don’t get as passionate

with their spouses as they do at

a football game,” Boas said. “We
need to wonder about that. Rather
than ﬁnd an answer, we need to
just ask the questions.”

We need to ask questions such
as how healthy an offseason-only
relationship is for marriages.

Boas also pointed out the “ugly
reality” of fathers at Little League
Baseball games. '

“We have fathers screaming
at kids when they miss a ﬂy ball
or strike out,” he said. “Thatnﬁ
antithetical to what sports are all
about.”

But Boas said while sports can
mirror the successes in life, they
also mirror the failures.

“Sports are a microcosm of
our entire society. All the forces
at work in a game work in some
way in our lives,” he said. “The
problems in society are often the
same problems in sports.”
