The NEW YORK CORNER is main-.

means of communication with New

is always necessary for the officers‘ ;

proximately the number to prepare
for ‘and’ a. post card directed to the
se-c.i'etary indicating whether you will
attend each a.ffaii' and the number of-
_g11ests* that will accompany you will b
be of greatest assistance. The ap-2 A

this regard cannot be overemphasized.

“Are we educating too . many
women?_” This question was _ one
which Emma .Hir'th discussed April
12, during the vocational conference.

The question was raised by the re-
port of the acting president of ‘the
Carnegie Company in’ New York,
-which makes money grants to educa-
tional institutions, when he said that
the recent boomin the demand for
college and university training," had
resulted in an over-emphasis on -going

 

 

people are in college who would sue-,
oeed better without wasting the time
on college work,’ while many who
can't go to colleT’ge_'should be there.“

that too many women are going to
‘college ‘by stating that there is no
greater need than that of liberaliza-
tion‘ of education, and that while a
different basis of selection, which
would include many that cannot now
attend college because of economic
reasons, is desirable, the needof edu-
cation’ is fundamental «and there’ is a
‘place for every college graduate.

- “In her ‘study or -occupations tor
women she ﬁnds this need is "felt. In
the various ﬁelds of home, making,

library work and business, she said
she had found an increasingneed’ and
demand .»for the educated woman. She
stated that in her experience, instead
of there being a surplus of educated
women, _.atl_1ere~ is a constant demand

ing competition for their services, es-_

N “On Writing for . Magazines," was
the subject of an address made by
Prof—.*John F. Frederick, in the Heinz
House, last Friday. ’ A
The first phase of ‘magazine writing
discussed was that or writing for trade
magazines. Professor
stressed the requirements for such
Work. stating that a. general back-
ground 'for literary work and a thor-
-ough acquaintance with the technical

 

tel‘,-participation pin the business, is
desirable. and personal qualities‘
should include adaptability V and the

gency.

In theﬁeld of creative writing, the
opportunities are less deﬁnite and less
numerous than those in trade, Pro-
fessor Frederick asserted. Success in
this ﬁeld is measured more by the
knowledge of a good work done. than
by the remunerativew side. In apply-
ing hlsfvocatlon to college students,
the speaker urged, in the‘ college
course, the thorough study of oneor
two modern languages aside from
English, a...ca.reful study of at least-
one science, preferably biology. and
an absolute knowledge or English com.‘
position. The years just after grad-
uation, according to speaker, should
be spent in gaining as wide and va;-*

out thought-oi writing. Reading, dur-
ing thisperiod should be in the ﬁeld

pects "to con-ﬁne-his work, and should
consist of the best writers in that
ﬁeld. .. V

writers mak'ln_g friendships and asso-
ciations during college .yea.rs',j with
other people interested in the same
vocation, which willbe carried on in-
to the long and weary -years or fall-
nre that usuallyprecede success;

Finally, the speaker brought out

“The University of Pittsburgh’s in-
vasion of Oil City on Friday’ night
was "successful in - more than one
way. It proved that Pitt has‘ a place
among the leading universities of the
"country in the quality of its musical
clubs as well as its athletic teams.
alt offered to alumni of Pitt an oppor-
tunity. to hea-r_the songs and cheers
of the old, school.‘ It afforded to
hundreds‘ of residents’ Q; , this city
an ‘evening, ‘of real enjoyment. For
in the

burgh Musical-‘Clubs began their pro-
gram.  ‘, —
-Pitts Glee -Ciub was above re-
proach. The voices blended well to-
gether. Every singer had real ability
and the club was well_ trained. ,It
presented a wide variety "of selec-

. «tions and in every way pleased the

audience. " —

"The, Mandolin’ -Club was a» feature
which proved especially‘ attractive to
many. The mandolins, guitars, violin
and -. piano made agc_ombina,tion that
could not help’ but please.

0 "In. addition to the numbers by
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs ‘there
were a number of real -features. .One
that took especially well was Xylo-
phone solos by John Thamm. "This"
instrument is not often heard‘ here
and I Mr. Thamm’s ability was very
pronounced.‘ -He was heartily encor-
ed. Miss Phyllis K. Newlands had a
number of short readings which she
gave in .prais'ewortl1y_ inanneiz The
Pitt Four was one of the best quar-
tets that has -been heard here in
some time and most of its selections
were newto Oil City. They also were
well received. .0ther feature num-
lbers nwere vocal ‘solos by j Frank
Dickinson and Girton Kinney a.nd a
celo solo by D. F."D’Ive»rn6is.
,"‘As__is proper in the case o-f a col-
lege ‘Glee Club ‘program presented
under the auspices of the Kiwanis
Club, the program was closed. with
the singing of» Pitt son-gsgand the
Kiwanis. song. The members of the
Musical Clubs then gave a short and
snappy Pittyell, such as is often
heard at Pitt football games.”-

-topic for discussion will be the “Pro-
-gress of Education in Pennsylvania.”

Prof. Francis‘ Tyson of Economics-
Dept; spoke before -Current Events
Group of Rodef-Shalom Temple. on
Wednesday, April 11, on “Nationalism
and Economics.” A ' ‘ .

The Woman’s« City ‘Club of Pitts-

uursery school movement, was the
subject of the address given-by» Edna.
White, director of the Merrill Palmer
School of Homemaking, Detroit, on
April 11., in the Heinz House. .

‘ In her talk Miss White made clear
the difference between the nursery
school, whichV*is a-pre-school institu-
tion, and the ordinary kindergarten

‘and the day nursery. She stated that
the nursery school takes the child

from 18 months to 5 years of age, and
trains him in right living, the pur-
pose being to teach him, without re-

straint or set methods, the fundamen- _
tal rules for good living and health,‘
and to-.— start him on his career of ,
' mental. development.

To accomplish
this, it is necessary tolieep the child
at the schoolfrom 9 o’clock',.in the
morning to 4 o’clock . in the after-
noon. The only set rules in the re
gime are those.concerned with the
time of eating and sleeping. The
school- differs from‘ the kindergarten
in that it"does_stress more the habits
of health, and from the daynursery
in that it gives the child mental train-
ing; as well as, daily care. , , 
The nursery“ school is common in

, England. especially in the .slum‘di_s-
.tricts.' where the chief concern is that

of health habits. ‘ ‘

    BASKETBALL MANA[iEll

‘Robert . O. Garvin was appointed
manager 1 of the", varsity basket ball
team. for the 1923-24 seasonat the
last meeting of the ,A,th_1etics Council.
_This_ ‘appointment came as no sur-
prise, as Garvinhad served as man-
ager of the Freshman 1 basket ball
team last season and as he was the
only? logical man for the po'sitioi’i.

Garvin has not conﬁned his activi-
ties to serving as manager of the
basket ball team. He‘ is also a. mem-
staft of The
Weekly, a member of the Classical
Club, and assistant1manager‘of the
tennis team. Heis also 3.1 member
of the Sigma Alpha. Epsilon .iratern-
ity. 

Garvin is a graduate of .Wilkins-
"burg ‘High, School. At present he is
a Junior in the ‘College. After his
graduation in June‘ 1924, he intends
to enter the Medical School.
