  Baboon liver
 recipient's

condition g

downgraded

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

Doctors have downgraded the condi-
tion of the first-ever baboon-to-human
liver transplantrecipient to critical as the
result of an unexplained infection and
deterioration of the patient’s liver func-
tion, according to the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center News Bureau.

)2‘ “However, based on a liver biopsy
taken [Monday] night, there.continues to
be no sign of organ rejection,” UPMC
spokesperson Jane Duffield said.

The patient’s condition began to
degrade Friday following a diagnostic x-
ray procedure, called a cholangiogram,
which involved injecting an x—ray-visible
chemical into the bile ducts, according to
a UPMC spokesperson.

“The results of the cholangiogram were
normal,” Duffield said.

However, due to a wide-spread infec-
tion, called sepsis, affecting his entire
body, the patient was put on a vent-

His bilirubin counts elevated above the

Bilirubin, a component of bile secreted
by the liver, is measured in the blood-
stream to gauge liver function. 4

“Doctors are not sure what the direct
cause of the infection was,” said a UPMC
spokesperson.

The 11-hour operation on the 55-year
old—man on June 28 was the first time a

Pitt’s new $23.5 million Sutherland
Hall, named after former Pitt football
coach Jack “Jock” Sutherland, was
dedicated Wednesday afternoon at
the ribbon— cutting ceremony.

Sutherland is the first ‘new resi-
dence hall to be built in 28 years, Pitt
Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor said.

1 Sutherland, loxtated near Pitt
Stadium, houses roughly 600 upper-
class students.

Two residence halls joined by a

two-story studet commons building
make up Sutherland. Students have a
choice of suites that house four or

six people,*or double—occupancy
suites. ' .

Student Government Board
President Gil Golden said that
Sutherland has a cafeteria, a comput-
er laboratory, optional cable and a‘
view to die for. A convenience store
will-soon be added.

Golden referred to the new dorm
as “Hotel Sutherland.” V

“Hotel Sutherland” also has televi-
sion rooms and study lounges locat-
ed on each floor, plus program,
social and recreational lounges on
the ground floor.

The cafeteria will be serving
around 7,500 meals a week to
Sutherland residents and students liv-

ing in the adjacent fraternity houses.

There is visual monitoring at the
entrances and lobby areas for securi-
ty purposes.

The university shuttle system will
be expanded to accommodate
Sutherland Hall and to increase ser-
vice for the entire university.

O’Connor said that one of his high-
est priorities is to provide a safe,
clean and attractive campus so stu-
dents can live and learn.

According to O’Connor, many lab-
oratories and classrooms will be
updated, and there will be added
attention to library issues and class-
room technology. -

Women’s Clinic opens

By Jason Hilhnan
Editor in Chief

Women with unique psychiatric needs now have a place
to turn. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic has opened a
Women in Transition Unit, theonly unit of its kind in west-
ern and central Pennsylvania.

The unit, which opened on Tuesday, has 15 beds on the
13th floor of WPIC. Its focus is on women either with a
reproductive crisis, such as depression that commonly
occurs around pregnancy or the birth of a child,
menopause, premenstrual syndrome or infertility.

“The idea is that women, biologically, are different, and
"they also need different treatments,” Barbara Conley, a
social worker at the unit, said. “Because psychiatric illnesses
are not just mind illnesses, they’re whole-body illnesses.
When one’s whole body is different from somebody else’s,
there is unique ways that treatment should be designed for
them.”

The unit is staffed by a psychiatrist, two social workers,
two nurse clinicians, who are master-level psychiatric nurs-
es, two or three master-level art therapists and a large direct

WPTS radio moving down the dial

By Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief _

Pitt radio station WPTS “98.5,
your progressive FM” will no
longer be at 98.5 on the radio
dial, at least if the Federal
Communications Commission
has anything to say about it.

On May 28 the FCC gave
WPTS a 60-day notice to
change its frequency from 98.5
to another frequency of either
92.1 or 103.9 because WPTS
was interfering with the broad-
cast patterns of WESA in
Charleroi, a station in a town
south of Pittsburgh.

WPTS asked for and received
a 45-day extension on that
notice. ‘

The interference occurred
two years ago when the FCC
allowed certain radio stations

to increase their power. One of
those stations was WESA.

There was apparently no
complaint by WESA, according
to WPTS general manager Ron
Asbury. “They probably aren’t
even aware that we are inter-
fering with them. lt’s a very
tiny overlap,” Asbury said. “The
reason the FCC gave us notice
is because they apparently
caught it on their computers
and they wanted to head off
any confrontation before it
even began.”

“It’s a problem that had to
happen eventually,” Station
Manager john McDonald said.
“We were put in the commer-
cial band by luck, I guess. We
weren’t supposed to be in the
commercial band in the first
place. We’re not a commercial
radio station. Someone was

going to boost their powerand
shove us around.”

On August 24 WPTS submit-
ted an application for a new
frequency of 92.1. The FCC
suggested 92.1 and 103.9 as
new frequencies for WPTS,
which has been at 98.5 since
1984. The radio station chose
92.1 because 103.9 is well into
the commercial band where
several stations can apply for
power increases. As a non-
commercial Class D station,
WPTS would be forced to
move again. 91.9 and below
are non-commercial radio fre-
quencies. "

Once FCC approves the new.
— frequency, which could be as

early as September 24, WPTS
may ask for a 30-day extension
to give the radio station time to

Alumni, new Pittfenmlesjoin in lantern night

By Shannon Kramer
For The Pitt News

Celebrating the spirit of all the
women who have passed through
Pitt, the ',/72nd annual Lantern Night
ceremony welcomed the incoming
first-year females to Pitt.

“The lantern is a symbol of inspira-
tion as you [the incoming female
class] continue your academic adven-
tures at the University of Pittsburgh,"
president of the Alumni Association
Virginia Dunst said.

The ceremony began as the new
students processed into the
Cathedral to the music of the
W-iontenis Chorale.

Dunst welcomed the women of the
class of  as Bob Lovett, another
member of the Alumni Association,
encouraged the girls to “be the best
you can be“ as they begin their lives
at Pitt.

The young women then received lit
candles after Pitt’s alma mater was
sung. “Lise light to illuminate your
path as you find your way at the
Liniversity of Pittsburgh," alumna
Deborah Lendo Finke told the
women.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor,

anchor of WTAE News Sally Wiggin
and members of the alumni associa-
tion also addressed the young
women.

“Light, liberty and learning are all
qualities being celebrated here this
evening,” C)’Connor told the class.

He wished the girls success in their
process of discovering over the next
few years and concluded his speech
by encouraging the young women to
create their own “golden dawn.”

Wiggin, also a Pitt alumna, gave the
freshman address. She spoke fondly
of her time spent at Pitt and inspired
the young women to “learn through
every aspect of life at the university.”

“Tonight is about the bringing
together of the past, present and
future because you [the young
women] are the future,” Wiggin said.

After the ceremony, the young
women were given the opportunity
to meet Pitt women alumna who had
participated in the event years ago.

“I thought [the ceremony] was
enlightening, no pun intended,”
Chrissy Pertzog said.

“lWiggin’s speech] Was inspirational
and made it worthwhile to be here,”
Pitt first—year student Chrissy
Butczynski said.

At the moment, two to four

end of the week. Patients can
be referred to the unit by a

The patients will range in age

a natural part of development.
For example, women move

any transplanted human liver would
become infected also.

According to the Health Sciences
News Bureau, the transplant community
in general would not transplant a

_ human liver into a patient with hepatitis
.. B because of the great likelihood ,
I the disease would recur in the new

liver.
In the second week of July, the
baboon liver recipient was upgraded

_ from critical to serious condition.

The patient was clinically stable,
showed no sign of tissue rejection and
his level of bilirubin, a component of
bile, was normal for the first time since
he contracted hepatitis B.

The following week a routine biopsy
found the baboon liver in the xenotrans—
plant patient had’ grown 30 to 50 per-
cent larger than its original size.

The patient suffered a minor episode
of rejection, during which his bilirubin
level became slightly elevated, but it
was suppressed with steroid medication.

University of Pittsburgh radio
this fall with a promotion to

inform listeners of the frequen-
cy change. Pitt radio was start-
ed in the early ‘60s by Adrian
Cronauer of Good Morning,
Vietnam fame. That first station
was WPGH-AM.

According to Asbury, the
WPTS call letters will stay the
same. “Hold on to your WPTS
98.5 T—shirts because they’ll be
collector’s items,” he said.

“It would have been nice if
we didn’t have to move from
98.5, but there seems to be no
choice about it,” McDonald
said.

Checkmate

Bobby Fischer —— truly a chess genius. In 1958, he
became the youngest player to attain the rank of inter-
national grand master and in 1972 became the first
American to win the world championship by defeating
Russian Borris Spasky.

Mr. Fischer was more than just a chess genius, and
the match in 1972 was more than just a chess match.

'. He was a representative of the cold war rhetoric which

pervaded our lives for nearly 70 years. And he came

A ' out on top. While his accomplishment was indeed spe-

cial, we care about Bobby Fischer not because of his
victory, but because he symbolized a victory over the
“evil empire” — no matter how silly it may now seem.

Despite his triumphs, the only thing that he has
come to symbolize now is a fallen hero. A recluse for
20 years, Fischer is in the news once again — but this
time for spitting on an official order, making anti-semit-
ic comments, criticizing the world’s leading players
and, most significantly, playing chess in a war-torn
area.

Were this match about charity, Fischer could possibly
be forgiven. By donating $600,000 to refugee relief,
that is exactly ‘what the parties involved are trying to
make it look like. But it is not. Fischer is hardly a
humanitarian and his motives are nothing more than
purely selfish.

But our question is, “who cares?” By focusing on
Bobby Fischer playing 70 miles from the war-torn area
of Bosnia-Herzegovina it diverts attention from the real
issues. At a time when the world is slowly pondering
what kind of actions to take, Fischer steals the thunder.

He has violated an executive order from President
Bush. He has also violated UN sanctions. More than

just breaching Federal law he spat on the order forbid- '

ding him to play. Should he play and return back
home, Bobby Fischer should, like anyone else, feel the
full impact of the law. But let us focus not on Bobby
Fischer, but on the real questions: the war in the for-
mer Yugoslavia, the violation of sanctions and the anti-

‘semitic views which he expresses.

A man that people looked up to for “their” American
victory, returns as the subject of scrutiny with his tal-
ents transcended by his problems.

Had Bobby Fischer wanted to make a constructive
impact he could have. The situation in Bosnia-
Herzegovina should be enough for one to put his petty
ego aside and make a difference. But many members
of the media are criticizing him for what they them-
selves are doing. Bobby Fischer is making a buck off
this crisis. The media is making one off of him. So be
it. But in the meantime attention is being diverted from
the real issues — issues this time which concern mil-
lions of lives. Fischer is not the cause, he is a symptom
of the problem. Let us address the real issues.

In Charge of the Third World Order

The idea behind an econom-
ic plan is to increase the overall
living standard of its citizens.
That is simple enough. But for
the past four years just the
opposite. has occurred. A dollar
today buys you as much as it
did in the early 19703.
American goods, once sought
by everyone in the world, have
become second rate. And eco-
nomic growth has been slowed
to a near snail’s pace.

I don’t know about you but
to me it seems like we’re going
in the wrong direction.
President Bush blames the out-
of-control spending by
Congress for our economic ills
(perhaps there is a kernel of
truth in this accusation).
Likewise Congress blames the
president. But in the middle of
this constipated government lie
‘you, me and posterity.

President Bush's plan is
based on something called
“supply side economics.” It has
largely been the policy of the
last three administrations for
the past 12 years, and it
assumes that the difference
between economic growth and
stagnation lies in a few simple
tax cuts. These tax cuts in turn,
it is thought, will spur the
owner class to invest more in
equipment, factories and
machinery. Therefore a
demand is created for workers.

This may be an economic
plan that is sound in theory,
but in practice it is flawed.
During the 19805 neither Gross
National Product nor productiv-
ity rose substantially. The bud-
get deﬁcit skyrocketed, and the
gap between rich and poor
increased. Those characteristics
sound an awful lot to me like a

country trying to place itself
among the Third World instead
of the “New World Order.”

Obviously George Bush
thinks his plan can work. You
cannot fault him for his gump—
tion. But he already had four
years and not once did things
look up. The time has come for
a change, but the question is,
what kind of change?

I think we need to look no
further than to our neighbors

Brett
Gilman

across the Atlantic Ocean -—
namely Germany and the
Scandinavian countries. Surely
global capital has not been
flowing into these economies
because of the low cost of
doing business. On the con-
trary, countries like Germany,
Denmark and Sweden are very
expensive to do business in.
There are high wages, high
corporate taxes and strict regu-
latory laws.

Why have the economies of
these countries grown then?
The answer is simple — they
have invested in their citizens.
All thesenations have national
health and day care, extensive
job retraining programs, the

opportunity for those who‘

don’t go to university to devel-
op productive skills and the
chance for their citizens to
upgrade their skills. All provid-
ed for by the government.

It is hardly ironic that these
countries have been extremely
successful during the past
decade and that global capital

has been attracted to them
despite their high cost of doing
business. Investing in their citi-
zens has made for an excellent
labor force and a superb infra-
structure. There is something to
be said for human investment
rather than just calling it
“wasteful spending.” Sure the
people of these nations pay
higher taxes than you or I do.
But, for the most part they do
not seem to mind. The differ-

ence is that they see where
their tax dollars are going —
towards their own personal
well being. Rather than empty
talk about “family values” these
countries value their people.

And now with the ability of
firms to shift production else-
where in the world to take
advantage of cheap labor and
lax safety and environmental
standards, the United States is
in dire need of a different strat-
egy.

An economic strategy which
focuses on people directly and
not in a “trickle down theory”
is probably the best bet.
Besides, I don’t want people
“trickling” on me.

Bill Clinton’s plan is a start
and it calls for more than $200
billion of public investment in
education and infrastructure.
We need to go further. Yes it
could mean higher taxes, but
do you have a choice? Do you
want to remain an intricate part
of the “New World Order” or
become a part of the Third
World Order? I would hardly
consider you “wasteful spend-
ing.” I hope that you would not
either.

\Vhat about Bob?

By Mike Sula
Staff‘ Writer

There was ae-time when a
particular friend of mine had so
confused the boundaries of his
life and the world of Twin
Peaks that those around him
started to notice peculiar simi-
larities.

Some of us_ thought it was
cute that he applied to the FBI
and registered his approval
with the effusive “Aces!” Some
of us just thought he was a
dork. When a ferret actually
went for his eyeball, we tried
to forget the episode in which
a pine weasel latched onto
Dick Tremain’s nose. But then,
as its two-season run began to
climax with apocalyptic impli-
cations (black lodge, white
lodge, red lodge), my friend
began to speak of a vast world
conspiracy involving the Gulf
War, certain biblical prophecies
and the make—believe town of
Twin Peaks. You see, he was
convinced that the world
would end immediately follow-
ing the final episode. Did we
scoff? Of course. My friend was
a punching bag. Yet strangely
the crowd that gathered in
front of my box every week
grew to’ cult—like proportions,
and while he whimpered in the
corner we sipped hot joe, hyp-
notized en masse like a
mooney wedding, waiting for
signs, clues, prophecies  wait-
ing for something to make

Monster 's long-winded soliloquy
leads toward an inescapable Box

By David Kaufman
Staff Writer

I don’t know why Spalding
Gray makes movies the way he
does, or why he makes them at
all. He made Monster In A Box
(his latest, although he has
never directed any of his films)
the same way he made
Swimming To Cambodia —- no
sets, no actors, no change of
scene or scenery.

It’s just Spalding, seated at
his desk on a stage. The back-
ground is black and the mur-
muring of a sparse audience
can be heard. He is a gray-
haired man with memorable
lips, bantering endlessly in the
rancor of the accent that is
New England. An 1800-page
manuscript sits to his left and
there is a glass of water on the
table. For an hour and a half,
framed only by the screen,
Spalding becomes the audi-
ence’s monster.

This is necessarily a bad
thing, not dependant upon
whether or not you like what

_ one giant soliloquy. Dustin

Hoffman plays a pretty good
Willy Loman, but when one
major network showed the play
Death Of A Salesman on prime
time, half of the country bum-
rushed the remote control look-
ing for ready, set, action!

Gray is not the first person to
fix the camera on himself for
90 minutes, and not strangely,
a majority of those have been
comedians. Eddie Murphy, for
one, had to work like hell to
make Raw entertaining +-
sporting tight purple spandex
and sweating b_ullets_‘_just to
make a moderatesuccess at the
box. office — at a time when
he was -hugelylpopular and
even dubbed the “world’s
biggest box—office comedian.”
But the camera’s eye, like the
human one, needs to move and .
refocus lest the viewer
becomes bored and the image
blurs or completely disappears,
like when you fix your eye
upon a -star and all the rest go
away._

Monster In A Box is a wasted

some funny, some tragic, some
contained in the manuscript at
his side. They all share the
common thread of Gray's on
own experience and his some-
times unique delivery and
interpretation. He is, after all,
an acclaimed writer. What is
interesting is that he freely
admits, on several occasions,
that he can’t just make things
up. Within this paradox lies the
core of Spalding Gray’s work;
inseparable from his dilemma,
he must write about his own
life.

He worked on The Killing

‘Fields, a film that included a

strong base of fact. One would

- think that a writer who can’t

make things up and despises
wrenching up old memories
would be content to stick to
other people’s stories. But
Gray, obsessive and narcissistic,
can’t help purging himself. So
he wrote Swimming To
Cambodia, which is an autobi-
ographical account of the mak-
ing of The Killing Fields, and
then he made Monster In A

paranoid glassies. (I know
you’re out there.) That, sadly, is
all that it is.

If you didn’t devote to the
series an hour every week. for
at least a season, Fire Walk
With Me will mean nothing
more to you than watching
Lynch and friends in his own
private playground — and you
aren’t invited. In fact, unless
you studied the illuminating
Diary of Laura Palmer, a lot of

Twin Peaks hopes to answer questions hi)/returning to the intro

character motivation will be
lost amidst the standard
Lynchian weirdness.

For example, if you know
Laura Palmer — if you visit her
in the red room in your dreams
— you know that hers is the
story of the struggle for and
loss of innocence. You know
that her coke—sniffing, red—neck
groping debauchery is a
defense against the possession
of evil personified in Daddy
Leland / Boogeyman Bob.
There are two Laura Palmers: A
good girl and a bad girl. If you
really understand her, it is the
bad Laura that you sympathize
with. Esoterica? Yep. Did I fig-
ure this out from the film?
Nope.

Fire opens on a scene unfa-
miliar to Peaks alumni. Special
Agents Chet Desmond (Chris

Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer -

Sutherland) are summoned to a
town down the river from Twin
Peaks to investigate the murder
of prostitute Theresa Banks.
Met at the airport by Bureau
Chief Gordon Cole (Lynch) and
sister Lil, the two are briefed on
the current of evil that has inﬁl-
trated the small hamlet all the
way through its police depart-
ment. '

Thus the first tenuous con-
nections to the the Laura
Palmer case one year later are
established: the letter ‘t’ is
found under Banks’ fingernail,
creepy music plays and a ring
charged with power is found

A Woman's Tale grips
the inevitablity of life

By Lori'M. Bossert
Staff lVriter

T wenty—five years ago, A Woman's Tale director Paul Cox
saw actress Sheila Florence for the first time. He recalls see-
ing her onstage as thus: “Here was a great actress. A formi-
dable human being. One day we would work together.” In
1991, shortly before her death, he got his wish. The result is
A Woman’s Tale, a unique blend of truth and fiction.

Martha (played by Florence), is a warm, vital woman in
her 805. Still enraptured by life, she brings her sense of joy
to all who will listen to her. Her character has an inherent
beauty unlike anything else in the theaters today. She faces
her last days with graceful valiance —— both the character’s
and her own. Fatally ill herself when the film was made,
Martha was created from Florence’s life experiences and _

director Cox’s imagination.

We come to know" Martha and her opinions on life and
love through the (persons surrounding her. Billy (Norman
Kaye) is her feeble neighbor, caught in his memories of the
past and unable to fully bring himself to live in the present.
Well played by Kaye, the character provides a stark contrast
to Martha’s acceptance of her own aging. A ~ g I

Martha’s strength and vitality are matched by that of Anna
(Gosia Dobrowolska), her visiting nurse. Their friendship
transcends the boundaries of age and experience, and exists
on a level of love alone. Dobrowolska gives a tender por-
trayal of the giving nurse who finds Martha to be a source

of strength and compassion.

Finely crafted, the film is filled with beautiful images. The
sequences involving a waterfall are particularly evocative,

account of the writing of his
autobiography.

His life, past and present, is
dominated he believes by the
nervous breakdown and even-
tual suicide of his mother.
Speaking about the main char-
acter in his manuscript, his

Monster, Gray tells the heart- '

wrenching, almost nauseating
last meetings with his mother,
forcing him into an adolescent
.who plays psychologist. Gray
quotes hermost disturbing
words, “How should I do it?
Should I do it in the garage
with the car?” '

The impact of this tragedy
resurfaces naturally during the
writing of Monster, and Gray
mixes in humorous accounts of
his encounters with a therapist.
But while seeking therapy for

the past, or for the drudging up

of it, Gray’s present is turned
upside down by the success of

Swimming To Cambodia. He

finds the monologue has quali-
fied him for all sorts of showbiz
projects, ranging from an HBO
special on UFOs, to the starring
role in Our Town To
Guatemala for a documentary.

Peaks

Continued from page 7

under a trailer.

The initial 30-minute seg-
ment, set away from Twin
Peaks is the film’s apex. Lynch
employs his best array of
seemingly unconnected anom-
alies for an effect that is typi-

_ cally terrifying, disorienting

and hilarious. ,
Harry Dean Stanton plays
cranky trailer park manager
' Carl Rodd and probably has

. ‘the most memorable line 

-the film (soon to adorn every
7-11 coffee pot in the nation).
Sutherland is a surprisingly
intense geek and Isaak leads
‘the investigation with a dispas-

\\sion that leads down dark

roads.

Cut back to the Philadelphia
offices of the FBI. A somewhat
green Special Agent Dale
Cooper (Kyle Maclachlan) is
having bad dreams about a girl
in the Northwest. As he pon-
ders their implications, he runs

around the offices playing with
the surveillance cameras” until
he spots long lost Special
Agent Phillip Jeffries (David
Bowie) entering the building.
Babbling a few cryptic jabber-
ings to Cooper, Jeffries initi-
ates a violent vision in which
we enter the red room and
confer with the dancing
midget (“some more garam-
bozia, please”). Upon awaken-
ing we learn that Agent

(Eesmond has disappeared

\wi7thout la trace from the trailer
park.

Finally we are in Twin
Peaks, the somewhat veiled
connections to the previous
segment being the ring,
Cooper’s visions as well as
Laura’s affiliation with Banks.

We know what is about to
happen. Laura is almost ready
for a dirt nap. Here Lynch
falters, assuming that what
many learned about Laura for
two years after her death

will be engaging for those
who have never met her
before.

This segment is filmed in the
same honey—colored light that
suggests sunset on sweetness
and innocence. We are treated
to visual images of Laura’s
secrets previously told only in
her diary.

We see her love for James
Hurley (TIPS James Dean). We
watch her blow snow with
Bobby Briggs and kill to get it.
We see the monster that slips
horse into Mrs. Palmer’s milk
and then sneaks. in Laura’s
window at night. We see the
partying Laura does when
most folks are still asleep ——
baby—bottomed youth on a
thrill-kill rampage.

Several scenes in this seg-
ment have the same violent
visual and aural intensity that
the first scene in Wild at Heart

had. Lynch says that_he likes a.

loud film and he is unapolo-

getic about the violence he
often employs. He’s right.
While many consider these
techniques exploitative, they
do provide amplerelease for
the unexplainable tension he
is able to thread his stories
with.

There is a beautiful scene in
which Laura and her best
friend Donna Hayward (con-
summate pe_ach-fuzzed inno-
cence played by newcomer
Moira Kelly) are lounging after
school in a sunlit suburban liv-
ing room. Donna asks Laura
what she thinks it would be
like to fall forever. Laura, with
dreamsicle eyes, replies that a
body would burst into flames
until nothing is left.

This is Lynch’s thematic
obsession. When innocence is
threatened it is better to be
sacrificed by fire than con-
sumed by evil. This and his
trip on the foetid rot moulder-
ing just below the surface of a

Its also hard to believe .
that you get free software when
you buy HP 48 calculators.

visually sun—bleached
American dreamscape are
essential to the entire Twin
Peaks mythos.

Unfortunately all of this is
squat, unless Lynch can some-
day wrap up his saga with
something a little less mastur-
batory.

Enigmatic loose ends are
integral to Lynch’s sense of
mystery behind the banal, but
where does it end? Virtually
every question on the meta-
physical end of things remains
unanswered.

It’s starting to look more
like Lynch doesn’t have any
answers either. Either that
or he needs us to keep watch-
ing.

Then again, over an hour of
footage was cut from the film,

-including contributions from

the Martells and Josie. The
lack of owls was another con-
spicuous absence. I missed the
owls. I miss the series.

and October 31, 1992. You’ll get

1 screams: emwoaetz

software, a ﬁee PC link cable
and hundreds of dollars back

than $500. And it’s going to
make your HP 48 calculator even
more valuable to you. The free

enter and plot equations easily,
do 3D plotting, and analyze
polynomials.

Pitt opens with another ‘patsy’

' By Rob Pugliese

.—._ .... -..._.. -..__

HOT DOGS

Since 1960, 31 years in business.

There must be a reason why!

Oakland
3901 Forbes Ave.

‘ ‘ Senior Staﬂ“ Writer

Classes are back in session at
j Pitt and it’s business as usual:
' annoying lines at the book-
. store, add/drop hassles,
overzealous first—year students
- and the Panther football team
opening up with another patsy.

No disrespect intended
towards Kent, but this is a team
that went 1-10 last season and
is pegged near the bottom of
the Mid—American Conference
in just about every pre—season
publication. -

The Golden Flashes young
head Coach Pete Cordelli is
counting on his offense to
shoulder much of the burden *
early on as his young defense
matures. But Cordelli realizes
the obvious mismatch that
. awaits his team and just wants
his club to concentrate on pro-
tecting the football Saturday.

“Right now offense is going
to have to be [our strength]
until our young people develop
on defense,” Cordelli said. “We

just have to come and compete
for 60 minutes. All we can do is
compete. The only team we
can control is ourselves.”

Like the Flashes, Pitt has an
abundance of youth on
defense, and this game may be
just what they need to ease
into the season. Panther head
coach Paul Hackett has said
youth is the key issue for the
this year’s defense and just two
seniors will start Saturday — end
Jeff Esters and free safety Lex
Perkins.

The Kent attack will not.
strike fear in Pitt’s heart, but
will help to prepare a green
defense for tougher tasks down
the line. The first and foremost
characteristic that Pitt will see
Saturday night is the option.

“Number one is the option —
option football,” Pitt defensive
coordinator Nick Rapone said.
“They run a lot of different
options, just like Notre Dame.”

The Golden Flashes returns
eight starters offensively, and
feature many of the same for-
mations that Notre Dame does.

CHEERS. On your way to the game,

100 Lytton Avenue - Pittsburgh, PA 15213

The attack is led by sophomore 9

quarterback Kevin Shuman.
Shuman started nine games as
a first-year player, completing
82 of 164 for 943 yards and
seven touchdowns. In addition,
Shuman is the Flashes’ leading
returning rusher, with 204
yards in ‘91.

Kent lost both its starting full-
back and tailback from last sea-
son, so a local tandem will get
the call Saturday night. Redshirt
first—year player Vaughn Mosely
of New Brighton is one—half of
the connection- He will start at
fullback with junior Troy
Robinson of Pittsburgh getting
the nod at tailback. Robinson, a
converted fullback, is a power
runner who saw limited duty
last season, carrying the foot-
ball ten times for 78 yards.

Senior Jimmie Woody returns
at split end. Woody caught 10
passes for 129 yards and two
touchdowns last year. Junior
Brian Dusho will. start at
flanker after coming to Kent as
a walk-on. He caught just six

to Hartford

.By George Klimis
Staff‘ Writer

The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported yester-
day that Pitt ba'sketball’s
Gandhi Jordan has trans-
ferred to Hartford.

Jordan, a 6’6” guard

started 10 games for the
Panthers and was an
intricate part in Pitt’s out-
side game. According to
the Inquirer, Jordan
selected Hartford over
Tennessee-Chattanooga,
Butler and Manhattan.
A Because of NCAA rules
on I-transfers, Jordan, who
has two season of eligi-
bility left, will not play
for Hartford until the
1995-94 season.

Last season, Jordan
played in 32 games for
the Panthers, averaging
4.2 points and 2.6
rebounds shooting 53.8
percent form the floor
and 27.9 percent form
three—point range.

jordan’s standout per-
formance came against
Texas in last year’s
Preseason NIT Tourn-
ament, scoring 12 points
and grabbing a career-
high eight rebounds in
Pitt's victory.

Jordan is the fourth Pitt
basketball player to trans-
fer to another school in
the past year. Omo
Moses transferred to
George Washington, Tim
Glover to a junior college
in Texas, and Dominik
Dumancic, who went to
Slippery Rock.

To say the Kent State defense
may have a size problem in
Saturday’s opener at Pitt
Stadium is tantamount to call-
ing Craig “Ironhead” I-Ieyward
a hefty fullback.

With a defensive front
that boasts (if you can call it
that) a 250-pound nose tack-

two-inches tall, Golden Flash
defense will need more than
mirrors, a rabbit’s foo and a

Fely.

They’ll likely need divine
intervention.

While Kent returns eight
defensive starters from last
season, there is plenty of
evidence to suggest that the
hearty Flashes-will be over-
matched matadors to the Bull
Crew of Curtis Martin,

Jermaine Williams andTim.

Colicchio — not to mention the

aerial attack of Alex Van Pelt‘

and Company — with evidence
like inferior size, speed and tal-

But despite this obvious dif-
ference, Golden Flashes’ head
coach Pete Cordelli finds no

reason to lament the distinct
disadvantage — preferring
rather to focus his attention on
something he can inﬂuence: his
team’s preparation and effort.

“Simply put, the size is some-
thing we don’t have on our
team,” Cordelli said. “That’s the
biggest’ concern we have. [But]
we can’t worry about anyone
but ourselves [come Saturday
nightl.”

While Cordelli aims to main-
tain his attention on the white
helmets Saturday, he’ll be hard-
pressed to ignore the potential-
ly one-sided matchup of Pitt’s
cumbersome offensive line vs.

T amalty, Williams must carry linebac/eers tbroagb transition

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Stag" l¥"riler

Pitt’s linebacking corps is a
difficult group to asses entering

\ this season. By no means is the

bunch completely battle-tested,
but with the players’ confi-
dence and athletic ability, they
will not come ‘out shooting
blanks, either.

Gone from last season is
four-year standout Ricardo

McDonald, now toiling for the
Cincinnati Bengals, along with
fellow outside linebackers
Curtis Bray and Nelson Walker.
Returning amidst great anticipa-
tion are two rocks in the mid-
dle that should make the transi-
tion on the outside much
smoother.

Junior Charles Williams and
sophomore Tom Tumulty blos-
somed into a formidable inside
tandem last season. They pro-

duced a combined 176 tackles.
With that experience under
their belts, expectations are
high for this formidable pair.

Williams is the combative sig-
nal-caller for the Panther
defense, as well as a fiery
leader and big hitter. His side-
kick, Tumulty, possesses
tremendous quickness and pur-
suit skills and should raise his
game another notch after a
year in the system.

Williams’s listed playing
weight is 245 pounds. Assistant
Head Coach/Inside Linebackers
Coach Sal Sunseri voiced some
unhappiness with Williams for
carrying some extra pounds
into training camp at
Johnstown.

“Right now he’s about 15
pounds over what I want him
to be,” Sunseri said. “I’m going
to ride him hard. He’s got some
weight to lose.”

Sunseri said Williams was
receiving stiff challenges from
sophomore Jimmy Morrison
and first—year student Jason
Chavis. Both Williams and
Tumulty will benefit from
intense competition. Sunseri
and Head Coach Paul Hackett
said junior Hayes Clark was
having a great camp.

Simpson fills 

in at outside

linebacker

Mike Johns
For T be Pitt News

With the departure of last
year’s starters at outside line-
backer, Head Coach Paul
Hackett had to do some shuf-
fling to fill those spots.
Searching in the secondary for
answers, Hackett may have
found them in sophomore
backup safety Gerald Simpson.

Simpson came to Pitt from
Warren G. Harding High
School in Warren, Ohio, and
was considered one of the top
high school safeties in the
country.

In his first year at Pitt he
played strong safety, backing
up Doug Whaley, but this sea-
son he will start as the outside
linebacker. '

At 6—feet, 5-inches and 215
pounds, he certainly has the

size to make the switch to l-ine- '5 '

backer. Simpson also showed
good speed by running a 4.5
second 40-yard dash this
spring.

According to Hackett, the
Panthers are very strong up the
middle with linebackers Tom
Tumulty and Charles Williams,
but the question mark has been
the perimeter. '

Because of Pitt’s lack of
speed at outside linebacker,
teams were able to run around

the corners and into the sec-

ondary with relative ease. This

year that may change.

An outside linebacker must
be graceful enough to cover
the pass, strong enough to mix
it up with those huge offensive
linemen and nasty enough to
knock a runner out. Simpson is
said to have‘ all of these quali-
ties.

“Gerald is an ideal model for
our weak-side linebacker posi-
tion,” outside linebacker coach
Brian Williams said. “He has
great speed and quickness and
is very physical.”

“My quickness, strength and
ability to shed blockers is what

. will allow me to produce as an

outside linebacker,” Simpson
said.

Plucekicker
endures
ruptured
append-ix

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Sta_[}“W1‘iler

Senior placekicker Scott
Kaplan will be out at least

..-rythree weeks while recovering

from an emergency appendec-
tomy.

The Coral Springs, Florida
native was pegged to start at

‘ kicker this Saturday  until the

surprise infection sidelined him
prior to a Pitt scrimmage in
Johnstown August 22nd.

What was thought to be indi-
gestion the night before prac-

tice, turned into a literal
wrench in the side of the fifth-
year senior.

“It’s the kind of thing that’s
totally unexpected,” Kaplan
said. “(When it hit me], I just
hunched over and couldn’t
move. It was an incredible
amount of pain.”

For Pitt’s eighth all—time lead-
ing scorer, the setback is just
another pothole on his long
road to recovery. Kaplan
recently recovered from off-
season surgery to repair a torn

muscle in his right knee, and-

was totally focused on __ having a

grand finale. to his Panther, ‘ ‘

Hackett Swill lean on special teams early

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staﬂ‘ Writer

As Pitt rolls toward its
September 5 debut against
Kent, one phase of the ‘92
Panthers that Head Coach
Paul Hackett expects to
depend upon through the

early portion of the schedule

is the kicking game.

Under the direction of first-
year Kicking Coordinator
Amos Jones, the Pitt special
teams will feature an aggres-
sive, straightforward philoso-
phy stressing fundamentals
and total—team goals; It's that
combination that hopefully

Zwill produce winning divi-

coach under his mentor, the
legendary Paul “Bear” Bryant.
It joins traditional concepts

pursuit, strong tackling) with
decision-making and execu-
tion.

. “We’ve got a quality-control
system that will be set up to
determine team goals,” Jones

“lC0ming in] I want to build

sport their
own ‘Bo’

By Jim Clark
Staﬂ" Writer

In the age of the two-
sport athlete, like Bo
Jackson and Deion
Sanders, Pitt’s football
team can say that it has
its own two-sport per-
former. That performer is
wide...receiver Dietrich
jells, a sophomore from
Erie who also partici-
pates on Pitt’s indoor.
track team.

‘ Jells "said he feels that

running track helps him

’ on the football field.

“lRunning track] gives
you a sense of confi-
dence out there knowing
that I’m in shape.”

Jellssaid that he plans
‘to run once again this
season. “I’m pretty sure
I’m going to run again
this year if the coaches
will let me and if I’m
able,” he said.

On last year’s track
team, jells recorded
team—best times of 6.41
in the 55-meter dash and
21.89 in the . 200-
meter event. He was a
qualifier for the IC-4A
Championships in both
the 55- and 20()—meter
events, but he did not

V participate in the champi-

onships. In his sopho-
more year of high
school, he was_.a state
champion in both the
100- and 200-meter dash-
es.

Jells, who has 4.17
speed inthe 40-yard
dash, led Pitt's receivers
last year by averaging
28.5 yards per catch. In
all, he finished sixth on
the team with 12 recep-
tions, three of those
going for touchdowns.

‘He said he thinks,

however, that he can be
more than just a deep
threat.

said. “But it’s not anything that
we publish it or let anybody

have knowledge of it.”

A reason for the secretive set
of goals lies in part in the
misdirected emphasis by the
mass media on certain phases
of the kicking game . . while
ignoring other important fac-
tors.

“The ‘hidden statistics that

" I they don’t put in,” Jones said,
— “like, ‘Do you force a punter

into a bad kick? Do you catch
onside kicks?’ Those are things
that are built into our quality-
control [system].

“That’s what coach Bryant
taught me  and I put com-
plete emphasis into it. I try to
incorporate more of the staff
and more of the players, realiz-
ing we want to accomplish
team goals through the team
game.”

Part of that incorporation
is giving every Panther an
equal opportunity to win a
starting spot. With most of the
starting coverage units undeter-
mined at the start of training

camp, Jones has an open-door
policy for those willing to
serve.

The two formats used to
determine the various kicking
teams are charting in practice
and performance in scrimmage
situations. Those who perform
in practice ideally will play in
the scrimmage, but that doesn’t
guarantee a starting job,
according to Jones.

“If a guy.is high on the
percentage charts [in practice]
but doesn’t perform in tree
scrimmages, he’s not gonna
have a realistic shot of being in
there come gameday,” Jones
said. ‘

“It’s still a matter of going out
to that stadium and performing
in front of that crowd.”

Jones is well aware of Pitt’s
inconsistent past in the kicking

‘game. In fact as the kicking

coordinator at Temple in the
mid-’80s, the Owls’ kicking

teams produced decisive plays '

in three wins over his current

employer.

Now the man responsible for
that phase of Pitt football,

Jones is determined to abide by
the same strategic philosophy
as that of coach Hackett.

“It’s not who we play or
where we play or the time of
day we play — it’s our system
[that mattersl,” Jones said. “The
field is the same, the conditions
are the same.

“It’s whether or not we exe-
cute our own system.”

Here is a position—by—position
look at the 1992 Panther kick-
ing game:

Kickers: Flip a Coin

The kickinggame was dealt
severe blow last week with the
loss of senior Scott Kaplan,
who had an emergency appen-
dectomy after the team’s first
scrim“mage at Johnstown.

With Kaplan out for at least
three weeks, placekicking
duties fall on the toes of
seniors Ed Frazier and walk—on
Sean Conley. -

Coach Hackett says that
Frazier has experience on his
side, but has been rusty.
Conley has hada terriﬁc fall so
far, but has yet’to play a colle-

giate game. At press time, the
duo is neck-in-neck. Conley
will handle kickoff duty.

Holding on placekicks for
Kaplan and Frazier falls on the.
finger of backup quarterback
John Ryan. The long—snapper is
senior walk-on Lou Casanova,
who hopes to fill the void cre-
ated by the departure of Jim
Royal.

Punters: Gone Today, Here
Tomorrow

The punting battle won’t offi-
cially begin until October 3 at
Maryland. That’s when ‘senior
punter Kevin Leon returns from
his ’four—game suspension
which is due to, transfer diffi-
culties. Until then the job
belongs" to senior Kevin

Theodorou, who shared duties.

with Leon in ‘91.

“Right now, we’re charting
up both [Leon and T heodoroul
to see who has the better hang-
time. Without a doubt [Leon’sl
going to be given every oppor-
tunity to win the job,” Jones
said.

Returners: The Thrill is
Gone

Though Steve Israel is off in
LA-LA land [a Los Angeles Ram,
actually], Jones may have the
answer in starting tailback
Curtis Martin. When Martin gets
tired of the double duty, help is
plentiful yet unproven with
Dietrich Jells and the first—year
quartet of Jay Jones, Curtis
Anderson, Dion Alexander and
David Sumner.

There’s always going to be a
situation [where we need other
returners] depending on how
much Curtis can handle,” coach
Jones said. “Right now, we feel
like he’s the guy that, if you get
the ball in his hands, he’s going
to produce for you.

“We’re going to work a lot of
other people to find out if any-
one can help.”

On the punt—return depth

Dave Nottoli are the top candi-
dates. '

er because I really didn’t know
the offense so much and
my skills and my potential
were limited.‘ But this year
coming ‘in and ‘having a feel-.
-for the offense, my role
changes,” Jells said.

“I become a posses.-
sion_-type receiver as well
as a big—play receiver, a-
receiver that can go out there
and make the five-yard—hitch
catch.”

Now thatjells has been with

,. the Panthers for a year, he

said he feels he has a better
grasp of Pitt’s offensive sys-
tem.

“I feel real comfortable with

the offense. I learned a lot dur-
ing the season. I think I learned
a little more during the spring
even though I was hurt,” he
said. -
He credits Pitt’s ‘ other
receivers for v helping .hiS
* learning process. "‘I think
I learned a lot by sitting‘
back and watching Chris
Bouyer and Junior Green.
They’re the veterans of the
team, so I try to watch them
run.”
jells said he understands that
he won’t have much more time
to learn from Bouyer and
Green, both of whom are
seniors.
“I try to absorb as much as

I can from those two guys
because this is the last year
that we’re going to be togeth
er, and next year I’ll probably
be considered the veteran. So I-
try to absorb. everything,” Jells
said.

Despite being injured earlier
this year, Jells said that he
currently feels healthy. “I
had a hip pointer this spring,

but I’m past that. I feel real _
sea- .

good coming into the
son, and I just want to stay
healthy.”

After his first season at
Pitt, he said he considers
his worst performance the

Hayes. He’s been here three
years now and he’s ready to
step up,” Hackett said. “And
Jimmy’s in a position where he
can push Charles. He’s still
young yet. Charles has the
experience. »

“I’m just delighted with the
fact that we have true depth at
the inside linebacker position,
which is something we’ve
never had before,” Hackett
said.

Williams and Tumulty should
get an occasional rest this sea-
son, something they did not get
last year. Sunseri said he is
pleased with the development
of his inside corps and believes
Morrison and Clark will sur-
prise people this season.

“What they do is bring imme-
diate depth to our football
team,” Sunseri said. “[Morrisonl
is in the same mold as
IWilliams. Clark] brings the
same attributes as [Tumu1tyl
does.” I

“Those two guys can play,”
Tumulty said. “Our whole
corps is gonna work and work.

  Kaplan

Continued from page 5
“It’s just a shame,”
Kaplan said. “I think that '
I was really starting "to
put. things together on —
the field. I thinkl was
primed for what should
havebeen V— and what
will be ,— my best ye-ar.”_ ,

Kaplan has been Pitt’s
leading scorer three times
and needs" just 16 field
goals to break Carson
Long’s career field goal
mark of 45.

He hopes to return for
Pitt’s Thursday night
matchup at Rutgers (Sept.
17th), but thinks the
September 26th home
game against Minnesota
is a more reasonable’
scenerio. T

For now, Kaplan sees
rest and rehab injhis .
plans. He is confident
that when his recovery
time is complete, the Pitt
coaching staff will give
him ample opportunity to
regain _the number-one
spot on the kicking depth
chart -— a spot he pinned
down prior to his latest
setback.

“I was already the
number-one guy,” Kaplan
said. “By the time the
depth chart came out on
Saturday, I was on top ‘of
it.

“I’m hoping that when
I get back to normal, I’ll

A have an opportunity to
compete for what I left
behind.”

 

  

 

P-9

It’s tough to stay out there and
play 60 minutes of football, so
if we have somebody to come
in  it’s making everybody bet-
ter.”

In addition to Chavis, fellow
first-year player Jared Miller has
shown Sunseri tremendous
promise. »

‘‘[Chavisl definitely has the
athleticism part,” Sunseri said.
“Before he leaves, he’s going to
bela darn good one, and so is
Jared Mi1ler."

How good this group
becomes depends on how
quickly they master the defen-
sive schemes and mental
aspects of the game, according
to Williams.

“Knowledge is the key,” he
said. “I’ve been here three
years, and this is the best group
of athletes we’ve had here
as an inside linebacking
corps.” ,

On the outside, senior Shawn
Abinet and" sophomore Gerald
Simpson appear to have the
inside tracks at starting against

‘Kent in the Sept. 5 opener, but

the wild card here is first-year

man Dell Seagraves.

Seagraves tore up his knee at
a North Carolina-South Carolina
all-star game following his
senior season in high school
and missed an entire year.

Seagraves is expected to
become a major impact player,
but after the long layoff it is
difficult to pinpoint when that
may happen. -

“The big question about the
makeup of our defensive foot-
ball team is the inexperience at
the outside linebacking posi-
tions,” Outside Linebackers
Coach Brian Williams said.
“There’s no question our kids
are talented enough.”

While the coaching staff
praises the talent, experience is

,a different story. Abinet, with

two career starts, is the veteran
of the group. The Panthers are
looking to him for leadership
and maturity.

After experiments at defen-
sive line and inside linebacker,
Abinet has apparently found a
home.

“It’s his time to step forward,”
coach Williams said.

Simpson is a converted free
safety whom coach Williams
calls “the cream of the crop.”
He has adapted well to the
changes and will be looked to
as the big-play man outside.
Simpson’s speed and quickness
could give Pitt a different
dimension outside, an explo-
sive player in the Zeke Gadson
mold.

“He’s going to be one of the
guys we try to showcase,”
coach Williams said. “He’s been
better every day since spring.”

Simpson said that he has
enjoyed the new challenge and
that the adjustment from free

‘safety has not been that diffi-

cult since many of

the responsibilities are simi-
lar. He ‘predicted that the work
ethic of the youthful outside
corps will pay out major divi-
dends this season.

“If I was to give us a letter
grade for this year, I’ll say it's
gonna be an A,” Simpson said.
“We work harder than a normal
group of outside linebackers
who have experience.”

drills was sophomore Tony
Reardon, who continued to
impress coach Williams at
Johnstown.

_“He’s mentally sharp and
physically talented,” coach
Williams said. “He can play
both positions outside, swing
between weak-side and strong-
side linebacker for us.”

Coach Williams acknowl-
edges that Seagraves’s layoff
has affected his play early on,
but he said it is only a matter
of time before the little things
come back to Seagraves.

“By the time he leaves our
program, he’s going to be a
hell ofa player.” —

Pitt has had problems
defending the outside, speciﬁ-
cally against option attacks.
Players such as Simpson and
Seagraves represent Hackett’s
commitment to improving team
speed, especially on the out-
side.

“The game of defense has
taken a turn,” coach Williams
said. “Schools are recruiting
faster people to coverthe
offensive speed.”

be one of the keys to their suc-
cess this year. How well they
will be able to handle the
outside will determine how
strong they will be on total
defense.

Simpson is replacing the oft-
injured Nelson Walker as the
weak-side linebacker. The
strong-side linebacker will be

‘ either Shawn Abinet or Dell

Seagraves, who are battling for

that spot.

“I’m very comfortable with
either Abinet or Seagraves,”
Simpson said. “Both are equally
good at the other outside line-
backer position.”

The Panthers’ outside line-
backers must be able to contain
the perimeter when playing
teams like Syracuse that run the
pro-option offense.

In order to have a successful

terpart on the opposite side
must contain fleet—footed
runners who love to hit the
corners for big gains. With his

speed, Simpson should
be quite an effective run—stop-
per.

To take pressure off Pitt's
inexperienced cornerbacks, the
Panthers have to put pressure
on the passer. In the late ‘70s
Pitt did an outstanding job by
using three—time All—American

linebacker Hugh Green and.
Rickey Jackson.

Green and Jackson usually
crept up to the line and mauled
opposing quarterbacks.

It is unfair to compare
Simpson with the All-American
Green, but Simpson possesses
some of the same physical
qualities. He has the three Ss:
Speed, Size and Strength,‘ all
qualities that can put a player
on that next level. ’

If Seagraves gets the nod
at the strong-side linebacker
spot, Pitt should have two out-
side linebackers who have the
speed and talent to rush the
passer and stop the run.

Seagraves is another outside
backer who has the three
S3, and together these two
could be the answer to
coach Paul Hackett’s‘question
about strength on the periph-

ery.

Defense

Continued from page 3
fruitful, as Sumpter received
the Jack Lambert Cup this
past spring —— an award
given annually by the
coaching staff to the top
defensive performer in camp.

Sumpter’s bookends at
tackle include sophomores
Sean I-loward (6 feet 0 inch-
es, 252 pounds) from Dayton,
and Greensprings, Ohio bred
Matt Jenne (6 feet 2 inches,
261 pounds).

According to Cordelli, the
strength of
Flashes’ defense is the defen-
sive backfield. Kevin Harris,
the team’s only senior defen-
sive starter, patrols the left
cornerback position. Junior
Vance Benton will play the
right side.

In addition to chasing the
likes of Dietrich Jells and
Junior Green, Benton will

the Golden ,

work double-duty as punt
and kickoff returner.

At safety, junior Keith
Younger will roam the deep
zone while Berkeley Claggett
draws the strong safety
assignment. At 5 feet 9 inch-
es, 178 pounds, the sopho-
moreClaggett gets the unen-
viable task of covering junior-
college All-American tight
end Rob Coons. At 6 feet 6

inches, 250 pounds, Coons V

will provide Alex Van Pelt
with a huge target between
the hashmarks and a
three—hour headache for Kent
safeties.

A pair of trump cards for
Cordelli’s gambling defense
lies at inside linebacker. Kent
is led by inside linebackers
Morrey Norris and Sean
Patterson — a pair of under-
sized, overachievers who
effectively stuffed Mid-

American Conference rushers
in 1991.’

As a red-shirted, first—year
starter, the S-foot—11—inch,
216 pound Norris was
the Flashes’~co—leader in
tackles with 142. He also
recovered four fumbles.
Patterson, a junior from
East Cleveland, matched
Norris’ tackle total of 142
and posted double-digit tack-
les in nine games as a
sophomore. _ _

Perhaps Ken.t’s weakest
link on defense is at outside
linebacker. Juniors Brady
Renners and Jeff Turner are
reliable veteran starters —
Renners a starter for 22
straight games, Turner play-
ing much of ‘91 with a bro-
ken leg — but neither have
the speed nor size to cope
with the talents of Pitt’s tack-
les and backfield. S
