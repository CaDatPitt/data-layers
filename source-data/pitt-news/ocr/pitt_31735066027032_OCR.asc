Search for Detre successor on hold

By Linda Wisniewski
Asst. News Editor

The search for a new senior
vice chancellor for health
sciences at Pitt will be on
hold until a replacement for
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor is found.

“The senior vice chancellor
is a very powerful position at
Pitt,” said Leon Haley, vice
chancellor of student and
public affairs.

“That person will be the
key to generating external
research dollars to the uni-
versity and to maintain the
overall academic mission at
Pitt,” he said. .

He said one of four final-
ists was offered the position,
but the person decided to
take a job offer at another
university.

“Those names were given
to the chancellor, and he was
free to choose,” he said.

“When the person refused, at
this point, the decision was
made to delay.”

“When the search is started
again, those candidates may
be considered again, or they
will start anew,” he said. He
said it will depend on how
much time passes before a
new chancellor is found. _

“The senior vice chancellor
is the mediator who moves in
a direction consistent with

Problems surface on PAT shuttle route

By Linda’ Wisniewski
Asst. News Editor

Standing room only, zone uncertainty and bus
cleanliness are some of the main frustrations
felt by students under the new Pitt shuttle ser-

vice. ‘

On May 1, the Shadyside and Squirrel Hill
shuttles were replaced with PATransit buses.
This change altered routes and, for some stu-

dents, reduced convenience.

But Bob Harkins, director of the department

ers are very receptive about the new system.
Students tell his department what times are

most crowded and whether or not the buses and
the drivers are up to par.

faculty is favorable.

Movie
draws
priestly
protest

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

While a priest and several
altar boys gathered to protest
the showing of the movie
Priest at the Beehive coffee-
house, one of the Beehive
managers knelt down and
joined them in prayer.

“I actually enjoyed their
protest because they didn’t
come to argue and debate,”
said Gregg Pangle, who is
Catholic and considered
becoming a priest a few years
ago. “I knelt down on the
Beehive property with a girl
that I knew, facing them, and
we all prayed together.”

Father Kenneth Novak and
about 10 altar boys, dressed in
formal church clothing, along
with members of the congrega-
tion from Our Lady of Fatima
Chapel on the South Side,
gathered in front of the coffee-
house Saturday night. They
prayed and recited the rosary
for about an hour, according to
Pangle. ’

Father Novak led the protest
because of the ﬁlm’s degrada-
tion of the office of the priest-
hood, he said.

“What they have shown in
there is scandalous,” Novak
said.

Novak hasn’t seen the movie
but described two scenes that
were particularly offensive to
many Catholics.

“They have a priest embrac-
ing a man and also making
love with him,” he said. In
another scene, “a homosexual
priest is looking at a crucifix of
Christ and makes a comment
that he sees [Christ] as a desir-.
able man.”

Saturday, the group prayed

MEXICO CITY -— Mexican
and United States officials say
Mexico is taking a greater
role in the anti-drug fight.
One of the changes includes
the use of air force jets to
intercept planes loaded with
cocaine. 1

The use of the military to
combat drug trafficking is a
significant change in Mexican
administration. President
Ernesto Zedillo decided that
the situation with drug traf-
ficking was so serious that the
military had to be used now.

The interception program is
still in the early phases. It may
be months before its effective-
ness can be evaluated. - New

WASHINGTON — The fed-

eral govemment’s ‘decision to
allow Taiwan’s president to
make a private visit to the
U.S. sparked bitter anger on
opposite sides of the Strait of
Taiwan on Tuesday.

The Chinese Foreign
Minister summoned the U.S.
Ambassador and issued strong
protest against the U.S. deci-
sion to allow the Taiwanese
president, Lee Teng-hui,
attend a reunion at his alma
mater, Cornell University.

The U.S. granted Lee per-
mission and the Chinese see it
as the U.S. supporting
Taiwan’s bid to create two
Chinas.

SALINAS, CA —— A
California girl is paying for
her brain tumor operation by
selling a 2l9—pound hog. Two
farmers have paid $108,000
for a pig that 14-year-old
Nichole Noroian raised.

The farmers paid nearly
$500 per pound, about 170
times the normal price. The
farmers attribute paying this
much because the proceeds
from the sale go towards a
good cause, Noroian’s med-
ical expenses.

The farmers have recently

Grant finonces law school book

By Jennifer Haluska
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Law School has
received a $50,000 grant
from the Obernauer
Foundation to underwrite
the Law-Down, as the
school celebrates its 100th
anniversary this year.

The Law-Down, written
by former Dean W. Edward
Sell, chronicles the history
of Pitt’s» law school from
its formation in 1895.

As one of the longest
serving professors at Pitt,
Sell is able to retell a large
part of the history through
his personal memories,
which include acquain-
tances from the first gradu-
ating class.

The law school originally
occupied the Orphans’
Court rooms in the old
Allegheny County
Courthouse. When Sell
became dean in 1965, the
school made several moves
and eventually was located
in the Cathedral of
Learning. At that time the
school had an enrollment

of 100 students.

It was during Sell’s lead-
ership that the Law School
began to flourish. By 1972,
the ground breaking for the
present day law building
took place, and by 1975
over 500 students were
enrolled in the school.

“I believe Dean Sell is
the inventor of the modern
school of law,” said Peter
Shane, current dean of the
Law School. Sell served as
dean of the school from
1965 through 1977. He
continues to serve the
school as a Distinguished
Service Professor.

With the help of a grant
received from the
Obernauer Foundation to
finance the -cost of the
book, the Law School will
use all of the proceeds
from the Law-Down for
scholarships.

“What impresses us the
most about the grant is that
not only is the foundation
underwriting the cost of
the book, but they are also

-enabling us to raise our
own revenue from the book

sales,” says Mark Gaffey,
alumni and development
director at the Law School.

The Obernauer
Foundation is named after
Harold Obernauer, a 1909
graduate of the school.
Obernauer also founded the
Law School Alumni
Association and later
became the first president
of the association.

The Obernauer family, in
an attempt to memorialize
their ancestor, has made
several contributions since
the early 1980s. Their most
significant contribution has
been a donation for a com-
puter research system, now
known as the Harold
Obernauer Computerized
Legal Research Center.

The most recent contri-
bution by the foundation
may prove to have an even
greater reaching impact for
the school.

“The book is an attrac-
tive tool for us to have,”
said Gaffey. “It’s the kind
of book that won’t ever go
out of style, and we can
use it to promote the

priests, both in flesh and in
doctrinal error, and also that the
church would have many holy
priests, according to Novak.

Scott Kramer, one of the
owners of Beehive, said, before
they decided to show the film,
he and the other owners consid-
ered not showing the movie
when they thought about possi-
ble protests. But Kramer
received two phone calls from
Catholics who requested that
he show the film.

The callers felt the movie
would expose a part of the
priesthood that the church
should begin to deal with inter-
nally, according to Kramer.

But the failings of some
priests should not supply movie
makers witha mechanism for
making money, said Novak.

“We do not -deny that there’s
this weakness that’s apparent
among the clergy,” Novak said.
“But to make it entertainment,
and to make money off of it, is
wrong.

“I would say that ‘a movie
like this has nothing to do with

solving the problems,” he said.

But compassion and forgive-
ness, not the priests’ failings,
furnish the movie with its main
point, Kramer said. Those
whom the movie offends seem
more troubled with the institu-
tion’s image, rather than the
message of the movie.

“The two main priests in it,
even though they do make mis-
takes, still try to remain true to
the’ essentials ——- forgiveness
and compassion,” Kramer said.
“Even though the movie’s con-
clusion is in a very strong way
about forgiveness, people are
more worried about the way it
was presented.”

The way the movie presented

the priesthood is not accurate,
say some Catholics.

“It does not present a true
picture of the priesthood in
terms of those priests who
struggle in a very sacrificial
way to serve the needs of their
people,” said Ron Lengwin,
spokesman for the diocese of
Pittsburgh.

A priest should live as
“another Christ,” according to
Novak, and should act “in the
name and person of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

“For him to act otherwise is a
grave scandal,” he said. “Those

priests should repent and be

removed, but not be made
material for a movie.”

The protest provoked Kramer
to consider whether he was
doing the right thing by show-
ing the movie, he said. But the
movie will remain on
Beehive’s screen because the
movie’s attendance has been
high. It’s too early to tell
whether or not publicityabout
the protest has attracted more
people to see the film, Kramer
said.

Showing the movie also
emphasizes a principle’ with
which Beehive owners have
highlighted their coffeehouse.

“I’d say this place has many
different opinions,” Kramer
said. “We’ve always been open
to all types of opinions, and
this is an opinion  Everyone
has an opinion about some-
thing.”

The protest was peaceful and
did not disrupt business flow,
he said. - ‘

The movie will show for
three more weeks, so Kramer
acknowledged the possibility of
more protests.

“As long as they’re peaceful,
I have no problem,” he said.

the advancement of medicine
and with the views and con-
cerns of the chancellor,” said
Haley.

Haley said the senior vice
chancellor for health sciences
oversees the sciences of med-
icine, dental medicine, public
health, rehabilitation and
pharmacy at the university.

The senior vice chancellor
is the highest paid and the
second-most powerful posi-
tion at the university, and is
currently held by Thomas
Detre, who has said he was
hoping to retire in September
once his replacement was
named.

Ken Service, director of
communications, said it is
usually the chancellor’s deci-
sion to name the position of
senior vice chancellor, but
because of the timing, the
university’s trustees thought
it would be better to hire a

SHARE OUR VISION FoR

committee.

“The position answers to
the chancellor, so that may
be the reason,” said Service.

“The trustees are in the
process of putting together a
committee right now,” he
said. “It should probably take
until mid-June.”

He said the senior vice
chancellor would be working
very closely with the chan-
cellor, and the trustees proba-
bly thought it would be a
good idea that the two have
an amiable working relation-
ship.

O’Connor announced his
resignation late last month
after upsetting faculty mem-
bers and key trustees by
eliminating HealthAmerica
as a health care option.
Enrollment at the university
has also declined since his
institution in 1991.

“Enrollment has declined,
but you cannot attribute it to
the chancellor,” said Service.

“I don’t think anyone at the
university blames the chan-
cellor for it.”

He said in 1991, total
enrollment was 34,336 stu-
dents. Today, that number
stands at 32, 519.

“So it’s a good 2,200 stu-
dents,” he said.

Haley said it will probably
take eight months to a year to
replace O’Connor.

He said a committee is now
being formed that will be
responsible for naming the
successor to the chancellor.

“As soon as possible, that
committee will be formed,”
he said. “The expectation is
that it will be very soon into
the summer.”

He said no decision as to
whether or not to name an
interim for Detre has been
made.

“That will depend on how
much time passes before a
successor for O’Connor is
found.”

“We’re marketing our stu-

for students with experience.
They say they want them to
‘hit the ground running’ by
gaining experience as an
undergrad,” said placement
counselor Patti Carle. “And
most students want the oppor-
tunity to work in their field
rather than at low-paying
manual jobs. This is a system
that can aid their search.”

Carle also recommended

He said he hopes that in the
future this system will expand

“This way students won’t

a previously run column) was printed which included the com-
ment, “Whites owe nothing to the black race. We can’t change
anything a particular race has previously done, whether it’ be
black or white.”

At Palomar College in California 3,500 copies of the school
newspaper were stolen after an article ran about a rally against
California’s Proposition 187. The claim was made that the article
was biased against the protesters. ' '

Instances like this are not uncommon. In fact, there have been
many reported instances of newspaper theft on college campuses
nationwide. At least 13 different incidents of newspaper theft
were reported during the 1994-95 academic year. The most fre-
quent motivation behind the thefts has been some type of racial
claim. Whether it is bias, underrepresentation or misrepresenta-
tion, racial groups have stolen newspapers as a form of protest.

This kind of behavior presents important issues to anyone
who, like you, reads a college newspaper. These thefts constitute
a violation of everyone’s First Amendment rights. Freedom of
information is something protected by the Constitution, and the
thefts of newspapers deprive everyone of that freedom.
Newspaper theft is detrimental to the entire university communi-
tY- .

Newspaper theft is also counterproductive. It is virtually
impossible to steal every copy of a press run, and stealing some
(but not all) copies is not even going to accomplish what the
intended goal was. If a group was under- or misrepresented in a
newspaper article, the public would have the opportunity to see
that in the article.

The claim that some groups are underrepresented or misrepre-
sented does not justify newspaper theft; nor does claiming racial
bias. Whether it is theft of a car or of a newspaper, it is still a
crime. The behavior of groups like those mentioned above is not
only wrong, counterproductive and nothing more than a publici-
ty stunt; it is against the law.

If a group feels it is under- or misrepresented by the local
paper, there are several possible solutions which are far more
productive than stealing newspapers. That group can encourage
its members to become writers for the paper so their ideas and
beliefs will be better represented. Almost every paper has some
type of reader forum; special interest groups or even individual
people can write letters to the editor with a reasonable degree of
certainty that they will be read. Voice your opinions verbally,
and make yourself heard. We would like to issue an open invita-
tion to anyone who feels they or their group are not properly rep-
resented by The Pitt News to come up and write for the paper.

Alert: Beware the thought police

ome of
you may
_ h a v e

thought that
political correct-
ness had begun
to lose some of
its steam. Oh,
how wrong you
are. The past
year has been a
banner one indeed for the icons
of feel—good language and
expression.

Rutgers and Yale both had
particularly interesting events
relating to the PC «bandwagon.
In case you don’t remember, at
Rutgers Francis Lawrence was

Colunmist
Erika
Kendra

forced to resign as president for

inadvertently violating a speech
code which he created.
Philanthropist Lee Bass offered
$20 million to Yale, on the con-
dition the school develop a
Western Civilization course.
The school refused to create the
class, and Bass could not make
the generous donation.

Even at Pitt the PC demon
has reared its ugly head over

and over last year. Specific.

instances which occur in classes
are impossible to relate, because
space is not limitless.
University—wide, however, there
have been several instances
where the PC police appeared.

One incident occurred when
several groups sponsored an
anti-Contract “On” America
rally. When conservatives
showed up at the rally and tried
to voice their opinion, they
were told by one of the event’s
organizers that they had no right
to be there —— on the William
Pitt Union lawn — despite the
fact that they all had their valid
student IDs. The organizer
called the police to have the
protest protesters removed, but
fortunately the police officer
had heard of a little thing called
the First Amendment. I suppose
the organizer had not. .

One other incident that many
people may not have heard of
(because it was not publicized

 .a,t..al,l). is. apomment by Pitt vice

chancellor for student and pub-
lic affairs, Leon Haley. As you
may or may not know, Pitt and
CMU have a joint-venture,
independently funded newspa-
per expressing conservative
viewpoints. The cover of the
paper says “a joint Pitt—CMU
venture”. Haley, in his letter to
the editor of that paper, claimed
that they had no right to use the
word “Pitt” in the paper because
it was not at all affiliated with
the university. The truth is,
Haley was afraid that Pitt might
actually be associated with a
conservative point of view.

A fax recently sent to me by a
member of Young America’s
Foundation describes still more
incidents of political correctness
in the university setting. Several
campuses nation—wide are prac-
ticing gross double standards
when deciding what to fund and
what not to. Among the organi-
zations refused funding or
which had their funding
rescinded were Habitat for
Humanity (at UVA), because it
is a “religious organization”;
The Virginia Advocate, a con-

servative magazine at UVA; .

Wide Awake, a Christian maga-
zine at UVA; The Red and Blue,
a conservative magazine at the
University of Pennsylvania; The
Carolina Review, a conservative
magazine at the University of
North Carolina Chapel Hill;
Students for Family Values and
the Conservative Interest
Research Group, both at the
University of Minnesota.

Each of these universities, by
refusing funding to organiza-
tions they feel are either “politi-
cally partisan” or “religion-ori'-
ented,” are guilty of gross dou-
ble-standards. These schools
willingly fund groups which are
racially oriented (as long as it's
not white), religiously oriented
(as long as it is not Christian),
gender oriented (as long as it's‘
not male) and oriented around
sexual preference (as long as it's
not heterosexual). If anyone
attempt's to say that these

, m-nuns are not either “noliticallv

partisan” or “religiously orient-
ed,” they are lying.

While political correctness is
supposed to encourage diversity
and promote understanding of
different beliefs, it would seem
that many riders of the PC
bandwagon do not believe it
necessary to encourage or
understand conservative or
Christian beliefs. (These two
sets of beliefs are NOT neces-
sarily the same thing, but nei-
ther is tolerated by the PC
police.) The actions taken by
these universities are not only
actions of intolerance for differ-
ing beliefs, they are acts of cen-
sorship. So where is the liberal
opposition to censorship? Not
here, because the thing being
censored is not in agreement
with their beliefs.

All these incidents are of cru-
cial importance to anyone who
is a member of the university
community, even if not a mem-
ber of the ones specifically
mentioned in this article. If you
sit secretly laughing that conser-
vative views are stiﬂed at every
opportunity, consider this: if the
conservative view were the
ones promoted, your views
would be the ones stiﬂed. If the
tables were turned, liberal
beliefs would be the ones
denied funding. Neither case is
right. If political correctness is
truly aimed at promoting the
understanding and tolerance of
different beliefs, why are con-
servative beliefs not included in
that tolerance?

Haley’s comments to the con-
servative paper at Pitt, while not
an official action of the univer-
sity, are clear proof that even
the hallowed ivory towers of
Pitt are not safe from the double
standards of censorship and
political correctness.

Le Bard

Royale

 

Every Pittsburgh summer,
Shakespeare is put on more
times than a bohemian sun-
dress. So I wondered, how is
this year’s Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival going to
freshen the old bard’s slippery
free verse?

The method will be abstract-
ing the sets, relating it to con-
temporary family relationships
and releasing the audience
from expectations.

Pouring rain whips against
the Cathedral of Learning as I
meet with Laura Ann Worthen,

. artistic director of the TRSF, in

her makeshift summer office in
the basement. Despite the
weather, Worthen glows as
she talks about her plans.
“What Saul (Straussman,
managingdirector) and I are
trying to do is unchain expec-
tations. I want the audience to
have fewer and fewer precon-
ceptions of what Shakespeare
is supposed to be. When I
kowtow to expectations, the

5- .I-.\,..,l

“Shakespeare is us. He
reflects us. He teaches us.
You have catharsis: romantic
in Romeo and Juliet, danger-
ous in The Tragedy of
Macbeth; transcendent in The
Winter’s Tale. I think so many
problems in this world would
be lessened if people would
allow themselves that cathar-
sis,” continues this woman,
who sees her mission as that
of storyteller.

Aside from being this year’s
slogan, “Theater Unchained”
appropriately describes the
design conceit. lt’s going to
strip the performances down to
the core, the premise; the
heart of the production.
“Theater is living, it has to exist
now  it’s totally temporal. l’ve
unchained it from a lot of
money,” Worthen explains,
since money is being taken
away from the arts, “it can live
in its glory without a lot of
encumbrances.” j

Don’t expect weighty velvets
and a Renaissance quintet. An
example of at least one
upcoming staging, Romeo and
Juliet, will feature music
including Squonk Opera and
Sinead O'Connor filtering
through a set consisting of
black scaffolding and shim-
mering, gauzy curtains. As I
talk with Worthen, Jared B.
Leese, the costume designer,
walks through the set of dou-
ble doors with leather “leder-
hosen,” well a couple of straps
at least, a mic tack harness
over his T-shirt. Leese said he‘
approached Romeo and
Juliefs costumes like “a ballet,

 

trying to say the most with the
very |east.” These period
nowhere costumes can be
described amusingly enough,
according to Leese, as “under-
wear with a twist.” Certainly,
they will contrast the cumber-
some Renaissance weapons
that the company will be carry-
ing around. ‘

The company this year is
made up of about 50.techni-
cians from a variety of new
venues, including University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, Penn
State and, of course, Pitt,
CMU and assorted imported
professionals. “l have a partic-
ular taste in classical acting. I
like a muscular approach to
the plays  I don’t think they
a-re prissy plays,” says
Worthen. “I look for actors that
can harness their energy and
bring it to me now.” She snaps
her fingers. “I tend to look for a
sense of energy coming from
your gut, not heady  impul-
sive. Physical. Sometimes it’s
very messy,” breathes
‘\/‘ilnjthen. ‘‘That’s_ what I have
to do as a director. I have to
try to make it all one world.”

This year’s directors are as
unique as the productions they
are producing. Worthen, a 37-
year-old American female, is
directing the season opener,
Romeo and Juliet. Bulgarian
director Mladen Kiselov has
experienced the tragedy of a
crumbling government. He
escaped from his country's
communist regime nearly 10
years ago. He will direct The
Tragedy of Macbeth. John
Neville-Andrews, a 60-year-old
Englishman famous for run-
ning the Shakespeare Festival
in Washington, will direct The
Winter’s Tale at the Studio
Theater. This production by
the eldest of the bunch is
rumored to have the most
modern feel to it. Although
they come from very different
backgrounds, their commit-
ment to Shakespeare and
these particular plays brought
them together. The works
selected this year range, in
order of appearance, from the
earliest of Shakespeare's
plays to one of the last. This
year’s festival will study the
Bard’s progression in his field
as a writer.

Deny thy father, and
refuse thy name,

Or if thou wilt not be but
sworn my love,

And I'll no longer be a
Capulet.
- Romeo and Juliet

Families in conflict -- the
influence is everywhere in ‘90s

   

culture. Anyone can turn
on the television and see
Rosanne’s children
arguing, Frasier’s par-
ent/child struggle and
The Simpsons (enough
said). All of the plays in
this year’s festival deal
with complicated family
relationships. It is the
single common thread.

The Capulets and the
Montagues cannot relate
to their children. The
parents seethe with
hatred and prejudice,
giving a bad example to
children having prob-
lems struggling to con-
trol their feelings of love.
The “Just Say No” atti-
tude isn’t working.
Macbeth and Lady
Macbeth have no work-
ing marriage, and
Macduff’s family is
among the first to fall
victim to Macbeth’s
revenge. In The Winter’s
Tale, there are overrid-
ing marital jealousies
that alienate children
and break hearts.
Dysfunctional families
are something we can all
relate to.

The administrative family of
the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival is anything but dys-
functional this year with the
creation of two new positions:
Managing Director Saul
Straussman and Production
Manager Vicki Scott. They will
aid the production of three fully
mounted productions (last year
there were only two), moving
away from the challenging —
in the sense that they were
politically incorrect — plays of
the past year.

‘‘I take care of day to day
operations (behind the
scenes),” says Straussman
later. “|t’s a pretty demanding
job, but I like what I do.” He
explains that he and Worthen
are working to present ‘a
younger company that will
reinterpret Shakespeare for
today.

Casting began in January,
and over 200 actors auditioned
to be a part of this year’s festi-
val. The work —— grants, net-
working, set design — stretch-
es over five months, but
Worthen’s days during this
week, only a few days before
previews begin on the 30th,
traditionally, if I can use that
word in this article, get more
hectic as the opener comes
together.

Her day will begin with meet-
ing with lighting designers at 8
a.m. Then she checks on the
actors’ housing, attends a tech

rehearsal and spends hours
cleaning up scenes until din-
ner. Following her break,
which may involve meeting
with designers, she will work
through scene changes until
11 p.m. and another meeting
with technicians, before she
can leave for home and crash
for the day. A cool half million
dollars goes into this non-profit
corporation, which leaves very
little room for mistakes. Within
directing and administrating
simultaneously, she tries not to
get so involved in Romeo and
Juliet that she cannot see the
wider picture. ‘‘I think my job
as an artistic director is to cre-
ate a place where people do
their best work. I have to know
that I have a certain amount of
energy, intellectual capacity,
going ‘OK, is everyone doing
their best work, and am I cre-
ating a place in which they
can?’ lt’s a really weird split.”
“Romeo and Juliet” opens
this coming Tuesday, and
Worthen seems comfortable
with it. “We all fall in love
exactly like Romeo and Juliet
do. I watch people watching
the balcony scene, and every-
body gets this wild, 14-year-
old face on them.
Shakespeare is tapping into
something primal.” She speaks
about how Shakespeare is so
elastic, people can have so
many interpretations, look at it
so many ways. Every time
Worthen mentions his name,

The Three Rivers Sykesprefestivlaﬂl  with 
Romeo and Juliet. See next week for list of dates and times.

the tone of her voice hits the
same pitch of a woman in love.
lt’s almost eerie.

‘‘I think Shakespeare is
extraordinary. I think he is the
center of our understanding in
Western culture,” beams a
serious Worthen.

‘‘I think I am an extremely
lucky person to be charged
with the chance to create a
place in which all of these dis-
parate people come together,
and get to do what they do
best

‘‘I get the chance to do (dec-
orate) this room,” she says, as
she extends her hand to the
center of the office towards a
strange painting that l, as a
dual'art and architecture
major, cannot place. lt’s about
three feet high, a woman with
one breast exposed. It doesn’t
look like her, but for some rea-
son it reminds me of Worthen
and the risks she has taken.
As in her home garden, she
gets to plant the seeds, allow
nature to happen and watch
the result of its growing.

“lt’s an amazing thing, scary
as hell, but itis in the fear of ‘
falling, taking that leap, that we
create great art.” She settles
back on her couch.

“Hopefully I’m learning how
to create a place where peo-
ple, both actors and audience,
can jump.” She smiles. “We
don’t know if our parachutes
are going to lift  but we
hope."

Picture Bride

Directed by Kayo Hatta
Written by Kayo and Mari
Hana

Starring Youki Kudoh, Akira
Takayama

and Tamlyn Tomita

It must be that I’m a girl,
that’s it. Either that or the fact
that I emphatically say, “|’ll go
see this movie,” because I
have definitely been getting all
these mushy family movies.
Anyway... ‘

In order for Kayo Hatta’s
Picture Bride to win‘ the
Audience Award for Best
Dramatic Film at the 1995
Sundance Film Festival, there
had to have been a lot of sen-
sitive film students who took
part in the vote or something.
The story is sort of overdra-
matic, and at times tugs
around the ole’ heart strings —
just hard enough to make even
the toughest of sensitive film
students say “Ahhh.” Even

though the film deals with an

interesting concept, that is, of
the “picture bride,” the appar-
ent “after all the pain and suf-
fering, everything’s resolved,
ready to move on” notion
brought forth at the end just
did not sit well with me. I just

didn’t fall for it.

For those of you not familiar
with the idea, “picture brides”
took place in an era of
arranged marriages (Hatta’s
story takes place in
Hawaii,1918). Meeting your
mate before marrying was diffi-
cult and rather rare. When
photographs became avail-

able, arranged marriages -

somewhat took a different turn.
Now soon-to-be newlyweds
had the chance to see their
mates and hopefully feel a little
more at ease (?) upon meeting
the strange person whom they
had previously only known
through letters.

Picture Bride delivers to the-

audience one early 20th-centu-
ry story of a young woman
arranged to marry a man she
has never met. All that links
her to him are his letters and a

small black-and-white photo-

graph. Sixteen-year-old Riyo
(Youki Kudoh) leaves Japan,
her aunt and her dark family
secret and heads toward
Hawaii, anxious to meet the
young, attractive man in the
photo, Matsuji (Akira
Takayama), in order to begin a
new life, this time as a sugar-
cane worker.

Upon meeting the groom,
Ftiyo notices something differ-

 

ent, something which she had
not noticed in the treasured
photo —— maybe it was that her
hubby looked about 20 years
older, or wait, he was 20 years
older! The hard-working
Matsuji calmly explains that
the photo was the most recent
he had. So, we have a 16-
year-old who believed she was
marrying a 20-year-old, but is
now married to a 40+ year-old.
That’s talks show material, my
friends.

After the deceiving picture
scheme, Fliyo decides to work
long enough to make it back to
Japan. Demanding, physical
labor does not come easy for
the small, frail city girl (her
severely calloused hands
show this,) and making the
$300 to get home won’t be too
easy either (she receives $11
for working one full month.)

Riyo’s story encompasses

the screen, and Hatta makes
feeling sorry for the deceived,
depressed young woman pret-
ty easy. One night, while run-
ning once more from her hus-
band’s post-honeymoon
advances, Riyo finds Kana
(Tamlyn Tomita) in the field
with a small child. We see the
inexperienced Riyo develop a
relationship with Kana, the
robust, hard-working woman
who knows her way around the
sugarcane fields. And we see
the importance of the friend-
ship to Riyo who, although
married, still felt alone.

Hatta shows the transforma-
tion of Riyo from a stubborn
city girl to a caring, married
woman. She now knows the
ropes of the field and the torch
is passed from Kana to Riyo.
Yes, Riyo was the picture
bride, and we watch her go
through certain painstaking

Picture Bride is Japanese melodrama and open this Friday at the Hex.  if '1

events which contribute to her
transformation. But Kana and
Matsuji are a pivotal part of her
life and change as well. Kana
is removed too soon (I found
her the most interesting), and
Kiyo’s husband doesn’t seem
to be a complete character.
What is his story?

Leave it to a third party to
rekindle the flame between two
people, which is just what
Kana does. But of course, as
some fool once said, if some-
thing is gained something must
be lost or sacrificed, and the
fool’s plan is followed through

in Picture Bride. And, by all

means, the sacrifice strength-
ens whatever was gained.
Trust me, itfsounds cliche
because, in many respects, it
IS.
Picture Bride begins Friday,
May 26, at the Hex Theater.

Kama Sutra

Kundalini
Blue Duck

Forget Kundalini. Suffering
would be a better title for
Kama Sutra’s follow up to On
The Cusp . Horrifying sick
relationships with parents and
violent erotic images paint the
music. With these dystopic

ideas, they create something‘

other than the quasi-mythic
babble Kundalini refers to.
Kama Sutra is better known
as a provocative Hindu writing
meant to encourage powerful
sexual positions, but this time
it’s a Buffalo-based band with
a walling sense of spirituality.
Both kama sutras are worth
writing about, but this piece is

on the progressive funk sound
of five musicians who are
breaking into the Pittsburgh
scene with their second CD,
Kundalini. With the operatic
voice range of vocalist Andrea
DeGolier, the rhythmic talent
of drummer Steve Puglisi, the
harmonizing bliss of bassist
Jason Clark, the inspirational
vision of guitarist Anthony
Aversa and the occasional
added bonus of trumpeter
Brandi Scrufari, Kama Sutra
forms a metaphysical universe
around its listeners.

A few of their songs come
off severely heavy with a
power characteristic of mas-
sive metal. The first track,
“Sad,” is a high-pitched, high-
energy sound that may give
you the impression this is
going to be a hard-core band
Pantera fans would enjoy.
They surprise you in the sec-
ond track, “Orange Socks,”
which sounds like a product of
some soulful indie rock band.
Kama Sutra’s style changes
from track to track with some
sporadic collages of mechani-
cal sounds and synthesized

voices. The Carni-clusters
between songs give the album
a positive burst. The lyrics and
tone constantly portray some
deep, sorrowful conflict.

When talking to DeGolier
about the suffering found in
her lyrics, I found that every
song is personable and has
some emotional significance to
her. This was a little upsetting,
because some of the harder
tracks are a bit morbid and
tragic. The nightmare reality
gives the album a depressing
motif that goes beyond clichéd
notions of Kundalini as an
erotic life-force.

To thicken the sound they
use a mix of percussions,
flute, piano and violins that
sounds comfortable together.
Because they have experi-
mented with a variety of differ-
ent sounds, they cannot be
pigeonholed into any one
musical entity. They function
as a slow-playing hard rock
band and evolve into a fast-
paced folk group. Deep-spirit-
ed ideas root their songs, but
the composition of the music is
what is first noticeable to the
ears.

Kama Sutra challenges its
listeners to break through
norms and explore regions of
their audible awareness by
combining an array of sounds
to stimulate your mind. Their
live performances bring down

Parents:

Go back

to school

here is
a big
prob-
lem develop-
ing in high
school sports
in Western
Pennsylvania.
It’s not as
Columnist crazy as the
Mark _ woman in
Gordon Texas who
attempted to
kill a girl who made a cheer-
leading squad over her
daughter. But it’s close.

One local football coach
claims his wife can no
longer sit in the stands at
home games because of the
verbal abuse she takes from
parents. Instead, she watches
the game from her car.

Another coach said he
repeatedly got phone calls in
the middle of the night from
parents who wanted their
kids to play more.

And one coach said a
father satin the stands dur-
ing a basketball game, keep-
ing stats on how many times
his son was open for a shot
and did not get the ball.

Some parents are ridicu-
lous. Somewhere in their
warped, one-track mind that
constantly is saying MY son,
or MY daughter, they forgot
about some important
aspects of youth athletics,
like sportsmanship, disci-
pline, respect and teamwork.

I’ve been on every side of
the spectrum. I’ve been a
player (starter and bench-
warmer), a referee, an
umpire, a concerned brother
in the seats and a coach
throughout different leagues
and various sports. 

I’ve seen some crazy par-
ents, but I’ve never seen two
coaches resign in the same
year because of them. The
victims, are Joe DeGregorio,
the boys’ basketball coach at
Upper St. Clair High School,
and Ed Goetz, boys’ hoops
coach at Sto—Rox High
SchooL

Some coaches don’t
resign. They hang on until
parents ﬂood school boards
and force them out. Lou
Meyer, girls’ basketball
coach at North Allegheny
High School, is an example
of that atrocity. After seven
years at the helm of that pro-
gram, he was booted.

“There’s no doubt in my
mind that parents had some-
thing to do with it,” Meyer
said recently in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The PG had a front—page
story on the parent/coach
debate in Sunday’s paper,
but they missed the boat

NCAA Bound

Fourth-seed Panthers win Big East Tourney

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Call it luck. Call it a minor
miracle. Call it divine inter-
vention. But whatever you
want to call it, the Pitt base-
ball team has it.

The Panthers overcame
incredible odds to win the Big
East Tournament Friday at
Bristol, Conn., earning them
an automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament. Pitt hasn’t made
the tournament since 1965.

“It was amazing,” said
senior Jon DeBernardis, who
was named the Tournament
Most Outstanding Player. “We
all went out there and none of
us wanted it to be our last
game. We had the adrenaline
going, and from there we
started dominating. There was
a lot of heart out there.”

The odds were definitely
stacked against Pitt. The
fourth-seeded Panthers barely
squeaked into the playoffs and
to make matters worse, Pitt’s
season record versus Seton
Hall, Providence and
Villanova, the three other
teams involved, was 1-8. But
according to Pitt coach Mark
Jackson, the Panthers used
that to their advantage.

“It’s difficult to go in know-
ing when those teams have
beaten us decisively at times,”
Jackson said. “But at the same
time, when that happens you
go in with no fear because
when you’ve been beaten
badly, you’ve already tasted
what that’s like. Sometimes
there’s an advantage to hitting
rock—bottom, as opposed to
going into the tournament not
facing that much adversity.”

Besides having already
faced major adversity like

By Matt Grove
For The Pitt News

Just one week after successfully bat-
tling through the wind and rain at the
Marauder Track & Field Classic, the Pitt
track teams proved to be all-weather
teams last weekend at the men’s IC4A
and women’s ECAC Championships
hosted by George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va.

The favorable weather brought strong
finishes for Pitt, as the men finished
fourth, only 2.5 points behind second-
place Liberty. The Lady Panthers fin-
ished fifth, and only 10 points separated
them from the second-place Seton Hall
Lady Pirates. Host George Mason ran
away from the field with a clean sweep
of the overall first-place finishes in both
the men’s and women’s competitions.

Coach Steve Lewis said he was very
pleased with the overall performance of
the men atthe IC4As.

Junior Anthony Dorsett sprinted to a

 

third-place finish in the l00—meter dash
with a time of 10.45. This was a person-
al best for Dorsett, one of many set on
the day by the Panthers.

Dorsett was followed by Jay Jones and
Dietrich Jells, who tied for fourth at
10.54. Jells also ‘took third place in the
200-meter with time of 20.96, just .06
behind his personal best, which he set at
the Big East Championships. Jones was
sixth in the 200 at 21.19.

Wes Alexander sprinted to a personal
best in the 400-meter hurdles, with a
time of 50.89, and finished third. Jerel
Williams took home sixth—place with a
new personal best of 51.34.

Jay Murphy, only .09 behind his best
time, took third in the ll0—meter hurdles
with a time of 13.09. Alexander fol-
lowed up his 400-meter performance
with an eighth-place finish.

“There were more personal records set
by the men at the meet this past weekend
than in any other meet I’ve coached at
Pitt,” Lewis said, commenting on the

solid day for the Panthers. “In fact, Pitt
has never before scored this many points
[46] at the IC4A Championships.”

The Lady Panthers also took advan-
tage of the excellent conditions in
Fairfax to finish fifth out of 39 schools.
As was the case with the men, many
Lady Panthers also set personal and
team bests.

Sophomore Angie Martin racked up
her best-ever time of 58.89 in the 400-
meter hurdles, which was good enough
to take third-place. Joetta Purter finished
sixth with a time of 1:01.06.

Martin and Purter then teamed up with
Tonya Mullins and Lakeya Smith in the
4x400 relay and recorded a team-best
time of 3:40.10. Pitt finished second
behind Seton Hall (3238.08). The 4x100
team raced to a 46.36 time, which
eclipsed the previous team record of
46.42, set at the Penn Relays.

tathlon. Sophomore Shanna Fadis fin-

Pin‘ baseball faces multi-
dimensional Oklahoma State

By Mark Gordon
and Brad Isles
The Pitt News

While the Panther base-
ball team was high-fiving
and bear-hugging, cele-
brating their first Big East
Tournament champi-
onship, the Oklahoma
State Cowboys were con-
ducting business as usual.

Pitt (37-14) will square
off against the Cowboys
(43-17), winner of 15
consecutive Big Eight
championships, tomorrow
in the opening game of
the NCAA Mideast
Regional Tournament.

“They’re a real good
team, they’re always
nationally ranked,” Pitt
coach Mark Jackson said

OSU is making its 27th
appearance in the NCAA
postseason, and has been
there every year since
1981. The Cowboys have
advanced to the World
Series from the regional
in nine of those years.

The Panther pitchers
will have their work cut

out for them, as OSU
leads the nation this sea-
son in scoring. averaging
10.65 runs per game.

“They’re always one of
the best offensive teams
in the country,” Jackson
said. “They play a lot like
we do. They play for the
big inning and try to
outscore you.-”

They are paced by
third baseman Tal Light,
who rocked‘25 of the
Cowboys’ 90 home runs
of the year and has
hit two of the team’s
10 grand slams. Light
also leads the team in
RBI with 97 and was
named MVP of the
Big Eight Tournament.
He’s batting .348, with a
slugging percentage of
.738.

First baseman Chris
Richard is second on the
team in home runs with
12, three of which are
grand slams. He also fol-
lows Light in RBI with
80.

On the mound, the
Cowboys are led by righty

Jason Bell. He finished
the year at 11-3, with with
an ERA of 3.17. Bell was
listed in College Sports
magazine as a top 25
prospect in the country.
He was a first team All-
Big Eight selection and
set a record for consecu-
tive wins in the confer-
ence, with 19 over the
past two seasons.

Bell's spot on the all-
Big Eight team is shared
with nine other Cowboys
including Light and
Richard. In additon to
those honors, five
Oklahoma State players
were named-to the all
tournament team.

One player who did not
make a post—season all
star team isoutfielder
Danny DiPace, who fin-
ished the year as the
hottest Cowboy. He has
ten hits in his past 22 at-
bats, with eight RBI.

Gametime is 3:00 EDT
on Thursday at the
University of Tennessee’s
Lindsey Nelson Stadium
in Knoxville, TN.

PoSt—Gazette sports writer Mike White implied winning

-From page 9

9 is the bottom line, as he described almost every coach who

has lost his job as someone who has taken his team to the
playoffs or won a championship. I realize the bottom line at
any level is winning, but it should be more important to
teach kids how to win, not just score more points or goals.

High school sports is not about how much your kid gets
the ball or how much he or she plays. It’s about learning,
something that probably should take place in high school
anyway.

How is a kid going to grow up into a responsible adult if
his/her parent tries to get the coach fired when things don’t
go their way?

Some coaches in Western Pa. have begun to fight back.
They hold meetings with the parents and set rules at the
beginning of the season. Some coaches take the Bob Knight
approach. They let the kids and the parents know up front
they are entering a situation where the coach is boss, no
questions asked.

But the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League has to take things further than preseason meetings
and forcing coaches to become hard-liners.

First off all, parents should be barred from all practices.
That is the time where a coach can see what kind of team he
or she has, and there shouldn’t be any biased parents there
affecting judgment.

Secondly, just as players and coaches can be fined or sus-
pended if they violate the rules, so should parents.

However, coaches should not be totally isolated from dis-
gruntled parents. The WPIAL should have each school set up
an hour a week where parents can ask a coach any question
they want about their kids. But that should be the end of par-
ents meddling in coaching.

What it really comes down to is that a coach should be
judged on how the players develop as people and athletes,
not who played the most or had the most shots.

Did any of these parents ever see the movie Hoosiers?

has won the tournament the
last four years.

The Panthers now play
Oklahoma State on Thursday
at the University of
Tennessee. Placed in the
Mideast Regional, Pitt, the
No. 5 seed, is paired against
national powerhouses like
Tennessee, Georgia Tech,
California and The Citadel.

“We’ll do the same exact
things,” Jackson said of the
upcoming game against
Oklahoma State. “We might
make some minor adjust-
ments, but we’re not going to
change anything.”

Pitt’s championship voyage
started last Tuesday when it
upset the first-seeded
Providence Friars (41-12) 6-2
behind Tedde Campbell’s stel-
lar pitching performance.
Campbell allowed two runs in
7-1/3 innings and five strike-
outs. The Panthers held a slim
1-0 lead going into the sev-
enth before they exploded for
four runs. With the bases
loaded, DeBemardis smacked
a bases-clearing double to
highlight the inning.

Mike Rohrbach came in for
relief to seal the victory as he
picked up his fourth save.

But the most remarkable
chapter of Pitt’s tournament
came in the second game
against Seton Hall.

Down 10-3 entering the
ninth, the Panthers erupted for
eight runs to snatch a 11-10
comeback win. Jason Conti
began the scoring binge with a
three-run homer. First base-
man Rob Garvey, who went 4-
for-5 and three RBI, belted
another three-run shot to cut
the lead to one.

Pitt tied the game after
Seton Hall’s shortstop Mike
Moriarty committed an error,
allowing pinch-runner R.J.
McCarthy to score from sec-
ond. Then, Joe Carter’s come-
backer to the mound was
thrown away, allowing pinch-
runner Ed Shaffer to score the
game—winning run. The win
advanced Pitt to the champi-
onship round.

“It was the most unbeliev-

able comeback that I have
ever seen, especially in a
playoff situation,” Jackson
said. “I have been coaching
for 20 years and have never
seen a comeback like this
one.” -
“That was the most amazing
thing I have ever seen,” pitch-
er Kevin Kramer said. “I’ve
been playing baseball my
whole life, but I’ve never seen
anything like that. To see that
happen, it was just the great-
est feeling.”

Pitcher Chris Bean started
the game, but was pulled after
allowing four runs in 3-1/3
innings. Rohrbach pitched the
remainder of the game as he
he picked up the win.

Seton Hall went on to play
Providence in the elimination
game to see who would play
Pitt. Providence won 6-0.

The Panthers’ joyride came
to a momentary halt when

they lost the next game, their
only loss, to Providence, 4-0.
Friar pitcher Andy Byron
tossed a seven-hit shutout -
Providence’s third straight
shutout.

Pitt hurler Gregg Mrochko
dropped his record to 6-2 as
he worked 3-2/3 innings.
Campbell finished the game,
allowing three runs.

With both Pitt and
Providence having lost one
game, Friday’s game between
the two teams would decide
the Big East champion. But
Jackson was faced with a per-
plexing problem —- who was
he going to pitch?

His answer —— middle—relief
man Kramer.

The result of J ackson’s deci-
sion was a 10-4 victory, as
Kramer cruised to an eight-hit
complete game.

An hour before the start of '
the game, Jackson brought
Kramer into the locker room

and told Kramer he was get-

“At first I was shocked, but
I was so happy to get the
opportunity,” Kramer said. “I
was definitely nervous, and
you could tell the way I was
throwing in the first couple
innings.”

Soon after the start, rain
delayed the game for about
two hours. Kramer said the
delay helped him calm his
nerves and settle into a
groove.

confidence and took it the

' ment, as he hit at a .353 clip

the tournament honors.

“The award is well-
deserved,” Jackson said. “He’s

been our leader all year; he’s
really held the team together.
He was the glue so to speak
for the team. It was only fit-
ting that he should be the tour-
nament MVP.”

“The main reason I got the
award was because of all the
RBIs,” DeBemardis said. “But
if it wasn’t for the other guys
getting on base, I would have
never been able to do any of
it.”

Pitt enters the NCAA
Tournament with a 37-14
record. But Jackson says their
record is very deceiving.

“It’s hard to figure out why
we did so well,” Jackson said.
“If you look at the numbers,
they don’t look very good.
For ‘us to have this record is
kind of remarkable. But it all
goes back to being a team.
That’s what these bunch of

Lewis had high praises for
the woman whom he said,
“is like a team within her-
self.”

“Najuma has had many
great days,” Lewis said.
“This is a girl that possesses
something very unique. She
is a mixture of mind, body,
spirit and courage. ECAC
brought out something spe-
cial in Najuma.”

Fletcher lived up to her
billing as an All-American
by placing in the top five of
in all four events that she
entered. A highjump of an
even 6-feet propelled her to
second place, 1.25 inches
behind George Mason’s gold
medal winner, Diane
Guthrie-Gresham. In the
long jump, Fletcher took
fifth at 20 feet-2.5 inches,
her bestof the season.

She then donned her racing
spikes to sprint to a third-
place finish in the 100-meter
hurdles with a time of 13.74.
Pitt’s Staci Suggs was fourth
at 13.99.

To many, this would sound
like a complete day at the
track, but Fletcher saved her
best performance for last.

Only moments after her
third-place finish in the 100-
meter hurdles, Fletcher had
to make her way to the triple
jump to face stiff competi-
tion, including Toimbe Hurd
from James Madison
University, who was ranked
second nationally coming
into the meet.

“Najuma came up with
something incredibly spe-
cial,” Lewis said of her per-
formance.

Hurd and Fletcher provid-
ed all spectators a see-saw
battle throughout the event,
until the field was trimmed
to these final two jumpers.
Each woman bettered the
previous jump of her com-
petitor, and the outcome
came down to the final jump
for each. Hurd ‘finished
strong with a jump of 43-feet
8-inches on her last attempt.
At that point, Fletcher
“reached inside herself” and
soared to her best—ever jump
of 44-feet 9-inches to capture
the lone gold medal for Pitt.

This meet closed out the
1995 regular season, but
Lewis is confident about the
program’s future.

“Next year we have one of
the best recruiting classes in
recent memory for both the
men and women,” he said.
“These new kids will come
into a program that is return-
ing 90 percnt of this year’s
men’s team and close to 95
percent of the women. The
future looks very good for
us, and hopefully we will
continue to get better.”
