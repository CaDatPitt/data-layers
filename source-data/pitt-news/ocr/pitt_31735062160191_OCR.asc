the proposed magazine. Other can-
didates will also be considered. No
date for hearings has been set.

Immediate cause. for the
Board’s action was the “True
Concessions” issue, the annual
parody. It first drew ﬁre from
the Newman Club, student Cath-
olic group on campus.

The Newmans circulated a reso-
lution in which they charged the
Panther with being “vulgar, base
and repulsive.” They threatened

to boycott it until it conformed to
the standards of the Legion of De-
cency.
-MC Backs Resolution
Other groups immediately joined
the movement. Men’s Council was
the ﬁrst to send its protest to the
Board. They urged that some ac-
tion be taken “to clean up” the
Panther. .
Student Congress called for a’
redeﬁnition of Panther policy.
WSGA Senior Court passed a
similar resolution, calling for a_
modiﬁcation of policy.

Panther Editor Paul Schwarz, in ‘

a letter to the Pitt News, admitted
the parody, issue was in poor taste.

 Goodbye Panther

The better element of the University last
week leaned by back, relaxed and heaved a
sigh of relief when the news that the Panther
was no more‘ was released. Although there
still linger some apprehensions about the
farewell edition, these have largely been dis-
spelled by the revelation in the downtown
papers that the last Panther will be a “liter-
.gry” issue. ‘ o _ I

It was a foregone conclusion that the mag-
azine would be discussed as a going concern

‘ for the last time at Thursday’s meeting of the

v ‘Publications Board. The “True Concessions”‘
parody hadjoutraged the “sound-thinking”,~
students‘ and it had convinced its wayward I

ﬂsupporters that anything else would be bet-

ter. , . , .
A No student organization can run afoul the

. administration too many times, yet the Pan-

ther managed to*tight—rope it for six years
before the axe fell. This year itran afoul of
the students, an accomplishment which it had
previously failed in achieving.

_ Each year the escapades of the magazine’s
“humorists” earned them reprimands, cau-"

 tions, protests and feature articles in the

doyvntown papers. Usually the most no-
torious issue was the annual parody and, true
to form,this year’s led straight to oblivion.

‘Few, if any, of the reprimands issued were

1 unfair or evidences of the administration’s
f is desire to dictate Panther policy. Most of

them were heeded by the ‘current editor but

_§. they were not binding on his successor. So

each year the new editor revoked or ignored

' whatever agreements had been made before‘

him.
* 3|‘, * *

We Voted to discontinue the Panther as

a humor magazine because we felt that _as
such it served no real purpose on the campus.
Humor is exceedingly difficult to write, espe-
cially when you are expected always to be

_— funny. . ~

. ‘The statement by the Newmans that the
Panther followed the path of least resistance
in using sex as material couldn’t have been
further from the truth. It is the last resort

‘P [ after everything else has been exhausted and

not at all easy to write because you must

 keep your eye on groups like the Newmans.’

“Then, too, risque material always seems
a little more daring when it is in print than it
did when it was spoken. The Panther editors
were always faced with the lag between the
printed gag and the spoken, and, too often,
they misjudged the reception it‘ would get.
After all, what one Newman will tell another
Newman may no-t ‘read so well in print.

We voted to ban the magazine because we

A I were convinced a “feature-photo” magazine

.of the format we have seen in other colleges
would be inﬁnitely superior to anything the
Panther could do at its cleanest or basest.

This type of magazine would not only cover ‘

the University more completely and more en-
otertainingly, it would not ﬁnd itself shackled
with the requirement that ’it be funny. ,

’ Editor \
The Pitt News

o~As-students at the University
of Pittsburgh we have heretofore
been apathetic concerning the is-
sues involved in the editorial
page of the Pitt News. We have
never lost any sleep over the
starting time of the senior dance
or where the PiKA tent was
going to be at thepsprihg festival.
However, the issues involving
the recent» Panther controversy
are of fundamental signiﬁcance
to ‘Pitt students and citizens of
a democracy.

The policy of the Panther has
been challenged by a university
organization as violating its con-

cept of morality. Through pres- -

sure and inﬂuence it has suc-
ceeded in the “virtuous” prohi-
bition of thenon-Victorian Pan-
ther.‘ We affirm that organiza-
tions’ Clemocratic privilege to
protest. But does‘ the privilege
to protest carry with it the right
to censor? We, the undersigned,
are certain that it should not,
and shocked that it has! On its
face value the action of the New-
man Club seemed acceptable.
But the consequences of action
are not as apparent as the overt
act itself!

What is involved in banning
the Panther that is not “appar—
ent?” Speciﬁcally this: A small
minority organization has arbi-
trarily limited an outlet of ex-
pression. They have
their will on a much larggr group
of students and narrowed the
limits of what it is able to say
at the University of Pittsburgh.
It is a morbid parallel of the
timid elements of American so-
ciety ugho doubt the inherent
strength-oftheir values and seek

' to quell all opposition by pro-

hibition and loyalty oaths. In
concrete matters truth can be
established and censorship is
unnecessary. In abstract matters
where the concept of truth dif-
fers, we will defend the right of
the Newman Club to express its
view. However, we vigorously
oppose their efforts to impose
that view on the rest of the
University. There are many of
us who feel that the burlesque of
sex by the Panther magazine is
a tonic for the overemphasis of
sex in other ﬁelds. Who is the
Newman Club to tell us what it
is not? For its own membership
ﬁne! Don’t buy it—-save a quar-
terl. “ I

But please don’t require the
rest of the University to conform
to the index. Restrictions impos-
ed on proscribed groups are
seldom static. The Na Club

   Censorship  

Editor
The Pitt News

In the issue of Apr. 25, the

Pitt News published an editorial
expressing the opinion that the
Panthermagazine is being sub-
jected to the threat of censorship
as. a result of the campaign of
student organizations, the New-
man Club among them. I should
like respectfully to disagree. It
seems to me that the Pitt News is
confusing censorship with boy-
cott, an altogether different
thing. For the administration to
suspend, publication of the Pan-
ther, or for a group to urge such
suspension, w o u led constitute

censorship; but for students, in-.

dividually or an organized group
to disapprove of the subject mat-
ter of the magazine and to refuse
to buy it, is volunta-ry boy-
cott . . . ‘

If the current issue, which
precipitated the protest, resem-
bles those issues which I have
seen, its characterization in the

resolution as “vu1gar,'base, and ‘

repulsive”. is hardly too‘ se-
vere. Preceding issues of the
Panther have often gone far be-
yond the bounds of good taste, in
seeming to pursue vulgarity for
its own sake . . . «

If this, boycott in the opinion
of the editors of the Pitt News,
constitutes censorship-, then I

In summary, it seems to me
that the Pitt News, in confusing
censorship with voluntary refus-

press where no such suppression
exists.‘ The best way to improve

It’s pretty well known by now that the Univer,-"

sity Publications Boardxhas banned the magazine,

effective after this last issue. Next year, perhaps,

some new type of magazine will
take its place, something pattern-
ed after a feature-photo mag like
Life or Look.

Something you might not
know, however, is the fact -that
this is the second time the Pan
ther head has rolled under ‘the
axe in its 38 years of publication.

The ﬁrst was way back when
in 1917, just three years after the .
magazine ﬁrst arrived on campus. There was a girl
in theIeditor’s chair then, a coed named Beryl.Pape;
During that yearshe fought a determined battle
with the University about what a circa-19l7\ stu-

 

dent magazine should print. She did not win and I

the magazine disappeared from campus.

Shied From Risque , . i
‘ Last year-—in the thirty-sixth anniversary edi-
tion of the Panther, Editor Don Horowitz had this

to say about the ﬁrst demise, “From that time 0!!“
Panther editors have more or less shied away from ’

risque material.”

Current critics of the-magazine will think him, ’

a bit facetious. I

i It was just a year later, however, that the Pan-i 

ther crawled back out of its cage and started laugh‘
ing again..Said the ﬁrst issue of the" reborn maga-r
zine, “Omicron Delta Kappa members noticed the
tragic decline of the entire school's morale, and
came to the ‘rescue. They~ gottogether and reorgan-
ized the Panther, appointing an editor and business
magazine.” .
Born in T914 .

The magazine was born in 1914, spawned from
the brain of an English instructor named George

M. P. Baird. As last year’s‘ anniversary issue come A
mented, “He went into a huddle’ with sorn-e‘_Pitt ,
wits and came up with an idea for a hu,mor_-maga''h , C

zine.” 1 P
The Panther was knockedloff campus'onei0the1‘f
time out but it took the Second World War toido it.

I,t,disappear~ed after two issues in 1943 but came back ‘

strong in 1947 under Editor Lee lvlclnerny. a coed.
and Business?Manager Franklin Blackstone.

The First Tap Day
, IRENE ROZAKIS

That over-sized wooden ODK key propped
against a tree in today’s ceremonies was probably
yawning at the. whole precedure. After all, it’s
been witness to Tap Day ceremonies for the past
25 years. ‘ /

Almost exactly 25 years ago, on May 13, 19275
The Pitt News"(then called the Pitt'Weelcly) pub-
lished an account of honors bestowed in the ‘ﬁrst
Tap Day at Pitt. }

Strangely enough, Tap Day, -a solemn Cere-
mony, originated as a part of Pitt Week, which
was the predecessor of Spring Festival.

The Pitt Week committee, looking for new ways i
to expand the program, hit on the idea of honor: ;
ing all tappees in one ceremony. Before this, tape“

ping was done at the honorary’s own private meet-

ing, and the honored, student was quite unsung ~

except within his own group.

The original Pitt Week Assembly, as it was
called‘ then, was an indoor affair on May 12, 1927.

Reginald Wilson a Bus Ad major, was the big
man that day since he won the coveted George
Wharton Pepper Prize. This prize f r “the senior
who best represents the type Pitt
duce” later became the ODK Senior Award.

The women carried off many of the honors that
year, with two Pan-Hellenic scholarships of $150
each going to Thelma Buenteof Mt. Lebanon, and
Iona Morganstern of Dunkirk, N. Y. Mildred
Trescher received the Phillips Medal for chemistry.

For some obscure reason the committee also
gave minor sports letters to Pitt cheerleaders for
the past 25 years. Twenty students made the Owl’s
Hall of Fame, and ODK and Mortar Board tapped
ten and eleven respectively.

Both congratulations and condolences were ap-
parent even then. An editorial in the weekly says‘,
“Tostrive, to achieve, and ﬁnally to be recognized
is the ambition of many, but unfortunately the
‘circle of recognition is small, . . Some names
were not called. -Though many aspire and per-

lected ‘few; we  a big open ohands.-Con

By JACK DAVEY
Sure t’was a sad day for the

. Irish when Carl Olson turned
' loose his Panthers last Satur-

day. The Pitt thinclads once more
turned the tables on the favored

Irish of /Notre Dame and clawed ~

their way to a 71-60 victory at the
Stadium.

Pitt swept ﬁrst places in ten of
15 events and turned in their best
times and distances of the season
in ﬁve of them.

‘Dick Weber’s 1255.6 win in the
half—mile was a -good indication of
the improvement of Olson’s squad
since the .Miami of Ohio meet two
weeks ago.

Monohan Shaves Mark

Wally Monohan added insult to
injury by setting a new,Pitt record
in the 120—yard high hurdles. The
sophomore timber-topper shaved

Two important tests-——today and -Saturda-y—-will prob-

_ ably‘ decide whether the golf and tennis teams boast unde-

feated records at the end, of the season.
Of course, even if Coach Dave¢

McCormick’s linkers beat Penn
State today and Coach Jim Tul1y’s
netters do as well against Notre
Dame Saturday, an upset along
their paths will deﬁnitely inter-
fere. But thoughts of clear charts
are more than wishful ones for

both squads.

McCormick’s group, even now, is
rated among the top link teams in
Pitt’s history.

Nittanies Toughest

They tee off with the Nittanies
from State College at 2:00 p.m.,
this afternoon at Shannopin Coun-
try Club.

The Panthers can expect their
toughest opposition of the season
after five successful outings with
Juniata, Navy, Georgetown, and
West Virginia twice.

Penn State beat Pitt last year,
5-2.

Captain Bob Reilly, three-year
veteran, shoots in the number one
position, followed by Andy Figura,

Previously, /the netters humbled

Tully will be without the serv-

BetterThings T 0 Come

CoacheLowell Dawson’s philosophy these days may well
be that the best is yet tocome.
It’s not that he isn’t pleased with the decisive 34-7 trim-

ming his varsity gridders-handed¢

the unconditioned Old-Timers last
Saturday.

In fact, he goes so far as « to say
that “the squad worked very well
together, even considering that the
Old-Timers weren’t too well-or-
ganized.

Ford Top QB
“But we d*idn’t«.even use Henry

‘Ford or Lou Cimarolli,” Dawson

eagerly points out. Both Ford and
Cimarolli were sidelined with knee
injuries, but will deﬁnitely be
ready next fall. '

Ford, despite his inactivity, ap-
parently has the inside rail for the
quarterback . post. His V nearest
rival, freshman Pete Neft from
Peabody High School, was one of
the‘ key factors in the Old-Timer
rout, but is still too inexperienced.

As Dawson puts it, “Neft played

very well; but we need Ford on
offense. As for the others, Rudy
Mattiolli is a good passer, but id

not as good a ball-handler as ‘Neft.
Blair Kramer, a senior, is proba-

bly out of the picture.”

Epps A Workhorse
Going onto analyze the other
positions, Dawson says, “At left
halfback, Lou Cimarolli will run
with Bill Hoffman. Hoffman is the
better passer, an important factor

in the single wing. But we can 

use Cimarolli mostly with the T.

“Our other backs will be Bill
Reynolds at right half, and Bobby
Epps at fullback. Inciclently Epps
carried the ball more than usual
last Saturday not because our sys-
tem calls for it, but because the
play was working very well.

Pitt’s basketball coach takes full credit for Wally Mono-

him for a check-up. Doc says Monohan was Worn out and
told him that his praevox latium was suffering. He told him
to go home for four days and rest. ‘

decision to release Monohan fromc

“On defense, our best lineback-

Linebacking is something new
for both Ferguson, who was a de-.
fensive halfback last year, and for
Glagola, who was a defensive end.
However, Dawson says that it will
be ‘_‘a permanent change.”
“At, defensive right half,” Daw-

. son goes on, “Bob Wrabley played
an outstanding game and will be

a regular at that position.

“Our pass defense wasn’t at its
best, but this canbe accountable in
that we didn’t stress it very much
in the drills. We can’t do rnuch in

“In fact, we didn’t put Richie
McCabe at safety until the last ten

One other conclusion Dawson
arrived at from spring training

a concerns the vacant line coaching

post which washandled by Ernie

“We’ll keep Hefferle there,” says
Dawson, “but we’ll have more"than
one line coach. We’ll probably
choose our other coach during the

  Wecht Reveals Acting
~ Talent in ‘Our Town’

,‘ it NNA LoU ALEX ANDJOHN WALLHAUSER IN UR TOWN

¥_¥ V

 

sea as.

By DICK SNYDER
. This has been a lacklustre season for Harvey Pope and
his Pitt Players; Of their three productions thus far, only
“Oedipus Rex”‘is worthy ofgnote, the other two—“January

Thaw” and “You Touched Me’

’—-retaining a tepidity usually

reserved for‘ extremely amateurish acting units.

Now, however, with
Town,” they have an impressive
work on the‘ boards andaall past
frailties are forgiven. For Thorn-
ton W ilder’s look at life and death
in Grovers Corner, New Hamp-
shire, is an important’ piece of
stagecraft. _

It’s been too many-years since
a theater group in this area last

L /attempted Wilder’s classic. Fram-

ed against the tired, disordered
lives we lead today, a play as so]-
idly rooted. to life as “Our Town”
isiindeed welcome.

B Principally, “Our_ Town” is con-
cerned with the Gibbs and Webb
families of Grovers Corner. This
is the story of young Emily Webb
and George Gibbs,-of their falling
in love,/their marriage, and Em-
ily’s death. 

Wilder’ has set his play at the
turn of the century; His people are
7 of the past -but they are not histor-
ical curiosities for they.have sub‘-
stance; they are real not justso
many protoypes; they are people
we understand, not merely props
for“ the Gibbs and Webb families.
Wecht Fine in Role , ,

In casting so large a show the
difficulties are manifold, but Mr.

“Our e

Pope has had remarkable success
with “Our Town.” A
"If the Players are still award-

ing an “Oscar” for the season's

top- performance by an actor they
can dispense _with the balloting
right now. They need look no fur-

ther thari Cyril Wecht’s highlyi

polished Stage Manager. It’s_ been
quite a while since Stephen" Fos-
ter Memorial has seen the equal
of Wecht’s performance.
_ Others Star» Also
However,‘ Wecht is only one of

a series ofpleasant surprises from ,
the acting department. Anna Lou ,

Alex is as healthy an Emily as I
have yet seen, and at times a bit
too intense, but on the whole she
accounts for a faithful portrayal.
John Wallhauser’s George Gibbs,
and Bob Gardner.’s' Editor Webb
are both ﬁrst—rate, and Bea Paul,
Elsie Locher, Don Poland, Paul
Hurley, and Wade Curry are all
admirable in support.'

Technically, “Our Town” is in
especially capable hands. Bob
Prendeville and Duke Fowler have
done the lighting, and Jo Bosco
the costumes. Everything here has
its customary big-time look.

lamation. ‘

selection of material.
New Mag Desirable

Jack Burwinkle, who spear-
headed the “clean-up” drive in
MC, today‘ said he believes an-
other. magazine should be recog-
nized. Burwinkle declared_ “The
Panther itselfrand its so—called

connotation of sex—publicity has

been banned from campus . . ._ but
I believe another magazine should.
replace it.”

The Publications Board meeting
last Thursday was longer than
usual but there was apparent un-
inimity that the Panther should
be changed. The possibility of cre-

ating a different kind »'of magazine

served to prevent dissension.’

Next week the ﬁnal edition of
the Panther as a humor maga-
zine will'come out for Spring
Festival. The editors say that
it is similar to our in the

past, especially the first four. ‘

which were received without
criticism.

Pitt Buys Hervey
Allen Papers

‘A grantof $25,700 by the Buhl
Foundation has brought the pa-
pers of the late Hervey Allen,
author of “Anthony Adverse” and
other novels, to the University
library, Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald has announced.

Speaking of the 1915 Pitt grad-
uate, Chancellor Fitzgerald said,
“Hervey Allen is probably the
most distinguished graduate of the
university in the ﬁeld of writing.”

Mr. Allen received his doctorate
in literature at Pitt in 1934, one
year after publication of his most
famous novel. His biography of
Edgar Allen Poe, “Israfel” was an-
other of his noted works.
