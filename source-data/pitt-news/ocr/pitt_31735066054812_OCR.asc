Maintenance workers
fear more staff layoffs

Anne Eston'l

   

A recent reorganization in Pitt’s main-
tenance staff resulted in more than a dozen
layoffs this year. More layoffs are expected,
but directors and managers are not reveal-
ing when they will take effect or who will
be effected.

Because no changes are deﬁnite and
many people are wonied about the stability
of their jobs, little information was dis-
closed to University employees.

“Everybody’s wonied. Nobody wants
to give any ir1formation,” said one Pitt
employee who asked not to be identiﬁed.
“In the meetings they ask us questions how
things are. No one will say nothing. [The
departments] have to save money — the
bottom line is money.”

Another supervisor guessed that nearly
17 positions have been lost; this includes
both students and full-time staff within the
facilities management alone.

“We’ve lost student [workers] and six
employees,” said the supervisor who asked
not to be identiﬁed. “You know how it is
around here. It’s a government thing, you
say something and the next thing you know
you’re doing night turn or you’re ﬁr 

The individual said reporters are being
stonewalled by University employees who
fear losing their jobs.

No one knew’ ahead of time that the

cuts would be taking place, according to
still another maintenance supervisor.
Departments were sent a letter on the fourth
of October and on the eighth, six workers
were ﬁred.

Directors and managers were not
quick to explain the reasons behind the
reorganization.

The office of business quickly referred
questions to Ana Guzman, the interim vice
chancellor in charge of facilities manage-
ment who was unavailable for comment.

Mary Kochik, Guzrnan’s assistant, and
Joe Fink, the director of administration for
facilities management, refused to com-
ment. '

Jerry Cochran, vice chancellor of busi-
ness and ﬁnance, said the reorganization of
the maintenance staff is a restructuring of
job responsibilities. He said this was neces-
sary to update the positions because some
jobs have changed over the years. The
restructuring occurred to keep the staff effi-
cient, according to Cochran.

There have been a number of positions
that were completely eliminated but they
were vacant previous to the restructuring.
Cochran explained that the University was
working hard to identify other employment
positions for the ﬁred workers.

“Many of the positions eliminated
were outside contract positions,” Cochran
said. “Some of those affected opted for
retirement.” ‘

Danielle Glaster teaches students to cope when class becomes overwhelming.

Study skills helps students
with the ”midterm craze"

Grappling with exams lately?
Those rnidterrns stressing you out?
The Study Skills Center, located on the
third ﬂoor in the William Pitt Union, is
now offering a way to handle the
midterm craze: ﬁve—week long, one
day per week, one—hour—and-45-
rninute study skill sessions.

“This is great because it helps stu-
dents manage things that can become
overwhelming,” said Danielle Glaster,
the instructor of the session and study
skills counselor. “We don’t just do the-
ory. These are concrete steps that can
be followed.”

In the next four sessions, topics
such as textbook reading, note-taking,
time management, memory improve-
ment, and test-taking will be dis—
cussed.

Individual appointments are also
available for those looking for person-
alized help with certain subjects or
study skills.

Glaster discussed the Information
Processing Study System, or IPSS, a
system in which the senses and long
and short term memory stores are ana-
lyzed and put to the most optimal use.

“The IPSS is the basis for the
strategies, like time ‘management and
textbook reading, which will be dis—
cussed in these sessions,” said Glaster.
“Short—term memory lasts 30 seconds
and most of the time, people work with
their short term memory, especially in
class when they’re taking notes.”

The very beginning of the hour
was spent analyzing characteristics of
a morning and an evening person.

Pitt study may help improve lives of Pittsburgh ’s elderly

will all grow old eventually. The
question is, what will society be
like when we are considered the
“elderly?” Will there be public
policy to help us if we can’t help
ourselves?

A ﬁrst-ever formal demo-
graphic look at the region’s elder-
ly population, conducted by
researchers at Pitt, may help pol-
icy makers implement programs
to make it a friendly society
towards the elderly.

The study has found that the
demographic proﬁle of the elder-
ly in the city of Pittsburgh differs
from the profile of the elderly in
the rest of the state and nation.

Richard Schulz, professor of
psychiatry, and Cheryl Zarlenga
Kerchis, a graduate student
working on her doctorate, are
conducting the study out of Pitt’s
Center for Social and Urban
Research.

They have found positive
and negative indicators that show
the city’s elderly population far-
ing better in some cases, and

 

worse in others, than the elderly
in the state and nation.

One such positive indicator
is the low percentage of the
Pittsburgh elderly living in nurs-
ing homes (see chart).

However, the researchers
aren’t sure why so few of the
elderly live in nursing homes. If
Pittsburgh’s elderly don’t have
the money for a nursing home,

in nursing homes may be a
Western Pennsylvanian cultural
difference — in essence, people
in Pittsburgh are more family-
oriented and the yormger mem-
bers of a family are willing to
take care of their older relatives.
According to the study, edu-
cation is another example of the
elderly faring better in Pittsburgh
than elsewhere, for the African
American elderly population in
particular. The study showed that
41.6 percent of the African
American elderly in the nation
have completed no further than
the eighth grade education level.
The percentage in Pittsburgh is

   

example, compared to the
nation’s majority of the elderly,
Pittsburgh’s senior citizens are
more likely to derive their
incomes from Social Security,
earnings, and public assistance,
rather than from retirement,
interest, and dividends.

The researchers do not know
the precise reasons for this, but
they feel one possibility is the
effect the economic decline in the
past made on displaced workers
in the city.

The study also found that
older persons live in older hous-

es. In Pittsburgh 56.8 percent of

Elderly 

the elderly citizens lives in a house built
before 1940, compared to 39.9 percent of
the state’s and only 22 percent of the
nation’s elderly.

According to Kerchis this is signiﬁ-
cant. “Most of the elderly live on a fixed
income which makes it hard for them to
afford improvements to their home, and
older homes usually need improvements,”
she said.

Over the last 25 years the Pittsburgh
region has experienced high levels of
younger people moving to different areas.
One consequence of the younger genera-
tion migmting out of the city is that
Pittsburgh might be viewed as a predomi-
nantly elderly population, which might
hinder youngcr people and businesses
moving back in, and ultimately stunt eco-
nomic growth even further.

“With the closing of steel mills and
other types of manufacturing plants, the
younger residents leave the area and the
elderly stay behind,” Kerchis said. ‘

Among metropolitan areas with a
population of over 250,000, Pittsburgh has
the second oldest area in the nation. The
first is St. Petersburg, Fla. with its tradi-
tional retiremcnt communities.

With people taking better care of
themselves and the advancement of medi-
cine, people are also living longer. This
means the number of elderly aged 85 and
older is on the rise in Pittsburgh and across
the nation.

According to Schulz and Kerchis,

Pittsburgh will face public policy ques-
tions in the coming years regarding the
aging population. For instance, how will
the city support them ﬁnancially should
they need help?

“The elderly are sicker in general, and
have higher rates in disability, than
younger people,” Kerchis said. “The cost
of care for the elderly is higher than any
other age group, therefore they place a
larger burden on the medical care system.”

The study raises several questions
about the future of caring for the elderly.
Will Medicare and Social Security be able
to meet the demands‘? Will nursing homes
care for the people who can’t afford to pay
for their own care? If not, who will pay for
these things?

“No one knows for certain,” Kerchis
said. “People are worried about having a
large population out of the work force.”

Schulz and Kerchis feel their research
will help the city government plan for
public policy.

“We’re trying to get a basic start, you
have to know the basic facts before you
can say the elderly are good for the region
or bad for it,” Kerchis said.

Schulz and Kerchis said they hope
this study will give people a better under-
standing of the changing social and eco-
nomic conditions among the elderly.

They’rc hopeful this understanding
will facilitate the development of policies
and programs to address the concerns of
Pittsburgh’s older population.

Number of  openings rises

Job opportunities are increasing in
Pittsburgh and across the state, according to
the semi-annual survey conducted by the
Lincoln Institute of Public Opinion and
Research.

The survey consists of businesses with
150 employees or more. Of all the companies
surveyed, 38 percent felt the business climate
had improved and only 14 percent felt that it
had worsened since last spring. Forty percent
of Pennsylvania’s big companies said that
employment was up, while 20 percent said
employment was down.

The company names and other informa-
tion are conﬁdential. The names of the busi-
nesses and employees are kept anonymous to
keep the companies honest, according to the
Chairman of the Institute, Lohman S. Hemy.

Stale audits 22 counties

Audits held in 22 counties across the state
found that 56 municipalities had no shortcom-
ings in their handling of liquid fuel tax ﬁmds.

The money is to be used for construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, and repairs to
roads, highways, and bridges.

The auditors’ job is to review the liquid
fuels fund allocations and disbursements to
make sure they are being used and invested
according to the Liquid Fuels Tax Act.

guarded liquid fuels funds against unautho-

trols and investment practices,” Auditor
General Barbara Hafer said.

Pension plans get $22 million

Twenty-two million dollars is being dis-
tributed to 108 Allegheny County municipali-
ties for employee pension plans.

The fimding is generated by a 2 percent
gross premiums tax levied on out—of—state
insurance companies collecting ﬁre and casu-
alty insurance premiums in Pennsylvania

Legislation was passed in 1984 to prevent
the collapse of municipal pension plans. It was
the first law to require Pennsylvania munici-
palities to ﬁrlly fund pension plans based on
actuarial studies. The goal of the legislation is
to eliminate the liability of unfunded pension
plans by 2015 and also to prevent using the
money in pension funds for other purposes.

Ridge makes State Court nominations’

Governor Ridge has nominated John A.
Maher, former Dickinson School of Law dean,
to ﬁll the vacancy on the State Supreme Court.

James F. Mundy, president of the
Pennsylvania Bar Association, praised Ridge
for “choosing an individual from the world of
academia, rather than politics.”

“We call upon the senate to put aside par-
tisan considerations and quickly conﬁrm Dean
Maher as interim justice,” said Mundy.

ROTC cadets be all that t

 

Sixty Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon stu-
dents spent their weekend shooting M—l6
riﬂes and rappelling down a 40-foot tower.
It wasn’t life in Oakland as usual, it was just
a weekend Army ROTC training program.

The ROTC cadets spent the weekend at
Camp Dawson in West Virginia for the ﬁrst
of two ﬁeld training exercises. The week-
end, which is two full days of simulated
Army life, is designed to expose new cadets
to what the day—to-day life of a soldier is
like. All of the cadets stayed in barracks,
woke up at 5:30 a.m. for drills, and ate in the
mess halls.

Rebecca Garber, a senior captain and

public relations and recruiting member,
said, “The weekend is a time for many
younger cadets to ask themselves, ‘Is this
for me?”’

For the older cadets, especially the
juniors, the weekend is a test of leadership
responsibilities and problem solving.

“For the juniors, this‘ is the ﬁrst big test
of leadership skills in preparation for
Advance Camp, a four—to—six week intense
training program prior to the time they will
serve in active duty,” Garber said.

Senior cadet Katrina Wahus, a battalion
executive officer, said she enjoyed the
weekend because she got to evaluate the
junior officers.

“We put the junior oﬂicers into deci-
sion-making and high—stress decision—mak-

ing situations to see what the outcome is and
the reasoning behind it,” Wahus said. “It’s
not if they succeed or fail, it’s more team-
work and the way they delegate certain
responsibilities.”

Throughout the weekend, juniors are

evaluated by the seniors in 12 categories that

focus on their ability to be effective leaders.
\V1th the help of this evaluation, the cadets
will get valuable feedback from their peers.
Over the course of the weekend and With the
other events in the ROTC program, the
cadets gain insight into what their strengths
and weaknesses are.

“It gives you a great opportunity to
learn skills that are beneﬁcial in any career
you choose,” Garber said.

Many cadets said they most enjoyed

Nick Prisco, a sophomore cadet said,
“The training we had was really exciting. A
lot of cadets got to ﬁre live ammunition and
to experience new situations for the ﬁrst
time.”

Keera Livezney, a freshman cadet, said
that every student gained a different appre-
ciation of the Army from the training expe-
rience.

“Some people did not enjoy getting up
early and not showering, but I loved it. The
stuff I did was stuff I never would have done
if it was not for ROTC,” she said.

According to Garber, the weekend is
the ﬁrst time for many ﬁeshmen to meet
other students with similar interests and to
feel a sense of belonging to a group.

“Many freshmen come out of the
weekend with a sense of accomplishment
and self-appreciation,” she said.

the day you work best,” said Glaster.

The participants then ﬁlled out a
questionnaire to find out more about
their own studying styles and discover
ways in which they can improve.

“When you compare the test results
at the beginning of the session with
results from the same test at the end of
the session, there’s a big difference.
People have usually learned a lot about
studying,” said Glaster.

She also emphasized the impor-
tance of “to-do” lists and planners.

“I usually set up a weekly ‘to-do’
list, but many people have daily ‘to-do’
lists. Sometimes I just have many post-
it notes stuck to my desk and that
works,” said Glaster.

I Glaster said that one of her majors
is psychology and many of the cogni-
tive psychology theories she had
learned in class were exactly what she
was learning in the training session for
student academic advisors.

“The Study Skills Center also pro-
vides individual services on an appoint-
ment basis for those who need study
advice or help with a certain subject,”
said Glaster.

Participants also want to gain nec-
essary skills for college.

‘‘I hope I can leam how to study for
tests —— especially multiple choice
exams,” said Jozette Benninger, a par-
ticipant in the sessions.

Pitt trustee founds attorney general bid on crime and punishment

For the last 25 years, every campaign
Mike Fisher has waged has been built
around public safety. His professional
growth from prosecutor to state senator to
attorney general candidate has been a natur-
al one, he said.

Cunently, Fisher is facing Democrat Joe
Kohn' on Nov. 5, 1996 for the post of
Pennsylvania’s attorney general. A socially
moderate Republican, Fisher’s campaign
remains conservative on crime issues.

Aside frorri being a part of Pitt’s Board
of Trustees, Fisher is a board member of the
Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance
Agency. As a member of the state Senate,
Fisher has supported additional funding for
educational opportunities for Pitt students.

But Fisher’s campaign has centered
around crime, speciﬁcally Pemisylvania’s

crossings, truck stops, bus terminals, airports
and other locations where narcotics may be
transported into Pennsylvania.

Fisher said the high visibility along bor-
ders will make people think twice about
attempting to transport illegal drugs across
state lines.

Finally, the plan places expanded
emphasis on education.

“As a lawmaker, I have not only backed
tough enforcement of our drug laws, but I
also have advocated drug education pro-
grams, including a 1990 law that required
mandatory drug instruction in grades kinder-
garten through high school,” he said.

Fisher campaign position reports state
that, according to researchers, aprimary rea-
son for the current changes involving drug

use is that students are losing sight of the
risks involved with drugs.

He also said he wants to work to pro-
vide college students with safer streets to
walk down at night by creating tougher
penalties on crimes committed by juveniles.

“I believe that juveniles who are con-
victed of adult crimes should do adult time,”
Fisher said.

Currently, Fisher is sponsoring bills that
would give judges wider discretion to keep
violent criminals behind bars longer. Judges
would also be permitted to add additional
time behind bars for inmates who fail to
behave properly in prison.

Fisher, who previously co-sponsored
laws which give communities notice when
an inmate convicted of a violent sexual

offense has been released, said he wants to
provide even more community awareness of
criminals in the area.

“I will seek to be an independent voice
as Pennsylvania’s elected attorney general
for all people of all parties, all ages and all
persuasions,” he said. “This is not a carn-
paign that will be about electing a

Republican, but a campaign about electing a '

person to represent and ﬁght for all the peo-
ple in Pennsylvania.”

Mike Fisher, 51, is a graduate of
Georgetown Law Center. He and his wife
Carol have two children, Michelle and Brett,
and live in Upper St. Clair.

the violators.

As an assistant district attomey, Fisher
prosecuted more than 1,000 criminal cases. 
As vice chairman of the Pennsylvania
Commission on Crime, he is currently spon-
soring legislation to get tough on those who
comrriit date rape, which will strengthen the
penalties for those who are convicted of this
crime.

At a press conference on Oct. 16, Fisher
also outlined a three-point plan to improve
effectiveness of drug law enforcement in
Pemisylvariia.

One of the anti—drug laws that Fisher has
co-authored requires convicted drug dealers
to forfeit their ﬁnancial assets to help pay for
drug enforcement and drug education pro-
grams. The law has generated $60 million V‘
during the past eight years.

their proper place

Bill and Bob are not the only ones making a dash for the Oval
Office this year. There are 231 candidates registered for the presi-
dential election, according to The Washington Post. Though it would
be impossible for all of these candidates to participate in the debate

a two—thirds majority of states, should be included

Third parties have always been with us; sonre have even turned
into major parties. Third parties give voters the beneﬁt of choice.
There is not a “none of the above” spot on the ballot. Third parties
offer a way for voters to proclaim their dissatisfaction with the two
major choices presented to them and infuse new ideas in the elec-
toral process.

Many major policy changes have started out as third party ini-
tiatives. Things like women’s suffrage and the minimum wage
began in third party platforms.

This year, the major thirdparties have been excluded from the

Elections in the United States are rigged in favor of a two-party

Blocks cause free speech free-for all

 

A university is perhaps one of the
few places left in American society
where principle still matters. Here at
Pitt,tlratmaybetrueinpolicy,butnot
so true in practice.

Freedom of speech is such an
essential principle in the philosophy of
our nation that the very First
Amendment to our Constitution pro-
tectsit. Pittgoessofartostateinitsfac-
ulty appointment and tenure policy that
tenured faculty are to “protect and
defend academic freedom” and along
with “ofﬁcers and board members
should work together towards that
end” .

Apparently, this policy doesn’t
extend to everyone.

Last week, I wrote a column that
addressed the quality of the food ser-
viceoncanrpusinahurnorousbut
entirely factual manner. Big Brother
wasn’t amused.

In response to the column, food
services not only conducted a back-
ground check into my personal block
spending (so far as to tell are over the
phone when and where I spent my
blocks), but also made it a point to call
one of my supervisors at the campus
job through which I am employed to
express dissatisfaction with the issues I
had raised in my column. Perhaps, I
wouldn’t have been vulnerable to this
type of scrutiny were I not a University
employee. However, I am.

When I spoke with food services
about this, a representative told me and
two of my friends who had accompa-
nied me that it is “standard procedure
to check a persorr’s block plan  when-
ever they comment on our [block] sys-

tem.”

What purpose, other than harass-
ment, is served by seeing when or
where a student spends their blocks or
by calling their supervisor simply
because he voiced his opinion?

These actions of food services
should concem and disturb the Pitt stu-
dent body. The United States Supreme
Court in its decision of Doe v. Univ. of
Michigan (1989) held that the princi-
ples of free speech “acquire a special
signiﬁcance in the university setting,
where the free and unfettered interplay
of competing views is essential to the
instit1rtion’s educational mission.” In
keeping with this decision, the ability

‘to contrast ideas should take an exalted

seat here at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Togoonestepfurtherinthispar—
ticular matter, the District Court of
Massachusetts, in its decision of
Antonelli v. Hammond ( I 970), said “it
would be inconsistent with basic
assumption of First Amendment free-
doms to permit a campus newspaper to
be simply a vehicle for ideas the state
or the college administration deems
appropriate.”

Clearly, food services didn’t deem
my opinion appropriate. Who can
blame them? The colurrm was critical
of the services they provide. However,
the fact that they disagreed with my
opinion did not give them the right to
intervene in my personal life. Here I
reiterate the fact that a campus employ-
er has nothing to do with the opinion of
their student employees. Checking to
see how or where a student spends his
blocks is an inappropriate response to
an opinions column. The appropriate
response would have been to contact

the paper-

Be forewarned that, due to “stan-
dard procedure,” you will be investi-
gated if you voice your opinion on the
meal plan policies. And if you work for
Pitt, be additionally warned that your
boss may be contacted.

This is ridiculous. Where would
such suggestive practices stop if
allowed to continue? Is Big Brother
tlratclosetoushereonourcampus
(though I’m sure these practices nm
contrary to Pitt policy)? However,
these events really happened and
appear to have gone unchecked. When
people begin to use their power or
authority to even suggest the suppres-
sion of ideas and get away with it, then
we run the risk of having our
Constitutional rights taken away. Not
only as members of the University
community and American citizens, we
needtoprotectourrightsandcryout
when they are in danger.

Moreover, I am left to wonder
why food services was willing to com-
mit these gross violations. They have
presented no factual evidence to
counter the argument of a poor value
for your dollar or lousy hours of opera-
tion. They defended the food as being
healthy simply because they have “a
nutritionist” on their board. Wow. I can
grab a nutritionist from the Lothrop
Fitness Center if I want to; that fact
doesn’t necessarily stand testament to
anything. I think that there are severe
problems with the food service system.
Unfortunately, food services feels it is
rrrore important to stiﬂe criticism rather
than improve upon its service.

“I really know how It feels to be
stressed out, stressed out...”

It could take forever to recall how
many times I’ve stood within the frigid
darkness of a dorm room in silent rage,
clutching my head in painful confusion.

As societal stress comes from
behind and bends me over to invade my
person, I scream out in anguish. “Why is
life so damn hard?? Why is there no
security in the future, in my future?
Why am I forced to struggle? Why does
this world ignore my pleas for help?”

Problems are hitting me hard. But as
much. as it hurts, I know giving up is
never an option. And it shouldn’t be for
anyone.

The so—called Generation X has
been pinned under the thumb of stereo-
types as uncaring slackers. We show an
undying lack of effort and an “I don’t
give a Fuuhhh” attitude. This stereotype
is highly ignorant and evidence of the
breakdown in communication between
the ages. Or is it?

Despite the majority of G X—ers
(which in my eyes stands for Generation
Expand and Excel) reaching for that
highest peak, there are a few of us who

 

THE PITT NEWS

have either given up or have drowned in
a sea of sin and sorrow.

There’s no argument that life is one
brain-squeezing test after another. There
are no study questions or study guides,
just instincts and experience. Life is
graded on a “learn from your mistakes”
scale. Those that do reap therewards of
their success and move on to the next
challenge. Those who choose to ignore
their faults and those who cheat are des-
tined to forever fall short.

There’s no reason to settle for less.
Just think. We live in an environment
infested with corrupt cops and crack
rocks, Goodfellas and glocks, 40-ounce
poisons, street pharmacists, and stick—up
kids, AIDS, abuse, and unemployment.
Homelessness and hypocrisy. A dying
educational system and racism. Toddlers
with Tec-9s. Taxes, war, and genocide.

In addition to the traditional seven
deadly sins, our society is menaced by
the seven urban sins, Frontin’, Drug

Dealin’ , Trickin’ , Backstabbin’ ,
Laziness, Materialism, and
Brainwashin’.

down by reality’s AK. Visions of white

A stressed student shares his angst with the rest of us

prison bars, alcoholic mommies and
coke addict daddies.
The "90s have spawned a new

dream, a dream to simply survive in a

world where futures are never promised,
but laughed at.

While the rich man zooms by in the

poor man chokes on exhaust smoke
holding his little Styrofoam change cup
while his turned out pockets sway like
American ﬂags.

“Tomorrow, tomorrow, no welfare
no health care, don’t prolong your hos-
pital stay.”

With all of this, you have to wonder
where Hell really is. If Hell is a prison of
the damned, a place to punish the soul,
with the torture and stress we feel every-
day, how do we know that we aren’t liv-
ing in Hell right now? .

Comforting thoughts, right? If your
spirit is broken by the pressure, then it’s
time to build it back up. If this is Hell,
then it’s time to look towards Heaven.
I’m not talking about white clouds and
harps necessarily, but rather peace of
self and the realization that nothing is
ever as difficult as it appears (barring
death of course).

"The fact that we live in this world

Where are all the good women hiding?

 

A very one-sided argument was

printed in The Pitt News on
Wednesday, Oct. 16, and I feel it’s
about time we explore this from a

‘male point of view. I do agree that

it’s difficult to find a good man, but
it’s just as hard to find a good
woman.

For many young adults, college
is a period of time when men and

women —— adjusting to a much more .

demanding, confusing, and inde-
pendent life than high school
offered — are searching for their
own identity and trying to over-
come their own fears and insecuri-
ties (i.e., maturing), men and
women alike.

It is such an atmosphere in
which we are also searching for
intimate companionship. When tak-
ing all of this into account, it makes
perfect sense that, through numer-
ous trials and errors, one may still
be unable to find “the right one.”

p.r. taylor’s aforementioned col-
umn does not seem to take all of
this into account. The column also
states that the women at Pitt “are all
sitting around at happy hour, won-
dering where all the men are,”
which is a big mistake to begin

with. A good place to find a man (or
woman) is hard to find, but there
are some places you definitely
won’t find them. Let’s review them,
shall we?

a)the bar scene: It would seem
pretty impossible to me to learn
about someone’s personality, matu-
rity, and personal and professional
aspirations when he’s already dis-
oriented, horny, unable to remem-
ber your name for more than two
seconds at a time, and one drink
away from vomiting or total uncon-
sciousness. College bars (or bars in
general) are places to drink and
relax, maybe even meet a friend or
two. But searching for an intimate,
mature relationship here is next to
impossible. They’re “meat mar-
kets,” not dating services, and when
women are approached by such
men, they either go along with them
(yes, there are women who com-
ply), or push them away and use
them as proof that all men are like
this. This puts all of us real men
who don’t treat women this way in a
no—win situation. (As a side note,
there are women who use men in
the same way. I speak from experi-
ence.)

b) the frat scene: see a).

taylor also brandishes men who

are “silent” and “sexually uptight”

as those who are not real men as

well. This is also upsetting, particu-
larly because I happen to fall in the
former category, and my co—writer
the latter. Being shy or virginal is
definitely not something that should
be critiqued or frowned upon. These
are nice guys who, with a little
encouragement and understanding,
can break out of these shells and
become the “real men” women
seem to be searching for.

So it may help to be a little
more open and willing to try new
things. The men and women at Pitt
should cease searching through bars
and parties and try something dif-
ferent. They should stay away from
the “violent” and “stupid” men that
taylor complains about, and try to
get to know someone who is not so
outgoing or immature. And, of
course, if you’re weeding out men
for their sexual, religious, ethnic, or
racial background, then you’re nar-
rowing your intimate possibilities
even further!

Where are all the real men at
Pitt? Good question. (If we knew
the answer to that, there would be
no reason to write such columns.) If
they’re like us, they’re probably
busy searching for the real women.
James Dinkins and Tim Handa are
seniors at Pitt. James majors in
Film Studies. Tim majors in
Chemical Engineering.

amidst constant mental decay is a more
than satisfying reason to progress and
make changes. Too many of us are quick
to wave the white ﬂags after a few
blows, before finding solutions to situa-
tions. Life is dirty. It throws wild punch-
es and low blows, which is all the more
reason to knock life on its ass.

As the uncertainties of 2000 threat-
eningly approach like Independence
Day alien mother ships, Generation X
must tighten its Airwalks and
Timberlands and march towards the
new millennium like soldiers into the
sun.
Equipped with the necessary
weaponry -— intelligence, patience, and
determination -— we must be prepared

to charge into glory at the ﬁrst thunder-.

ing note of success’ horn.

Most of us are, but a few of our
mental warriors have bullshitted
through basic training, or are a.w.o.l.
from reality. If you know someone like
this, hunt them down like a fugitive and
bring them back. Because unlike
Darwin’s “survival of the fittest” theory,
I believe everyone is fit to survive. It’s
just a matter of how bad you want to.

Sports on television is a multi—billion
dollar business. It’s no longer just the big
four — football, baseball, basketball, and
hockey. We have horse racing, golf, bowling,
Australian—rules football, soccer, and even a
billiards game here or there if we’re lucky.

Sports aren’t just sports anymore,
they’re stellar athletes in competitive com-
mercials. Beingahugesportsfan,Itendto
look past the commercialism and try to enjoy
the game, but Tuesday night in Game Three
of the World Series I noticed something that
really bugged me e the enormous World
Series logo patches on the side of the play-
ers’ hats.

Couldn’t they have thought of some-
thingbetter?Whataboutanadforthe
Money Store on Cecil F1elder’s back, or how
about in between pitches the players shoot
15—second snippets for TV ads.

Corporate America has gone too far this
time.

Fine. Nike giving Tiger Woods millions
of dollars to wear sonre hats and shirts is
okay with me. He is a proven player and he
deserves it. The same goes for Jordan,
Barkley, David Robinson, Deion, and the
rest of the superstars that rake in the dough
just for wearing a particular corporate logo.
The Swoosh is more powerful than we
think.

Hey, who hasn’t owned a pair of Air
Jordan’s or some other garment that had the
likeness or signature of a pro athlete? It’s
really not that big of a deal, but the limits are
being pushed.

Recently ESPN conducted a poll of

Coming off the 55-7 pounding
handed to them by the Syracuse
Orangemen and a bye week, Pitt (2-5)
looks to shuffle its lineup heading into
this week’s road game in Blacksburg,
Va., where the Panthers will battle Big
East foe Virginia Tech.

Head Coach Johnny Majors, (who
has deemed the Panthers’ freshman class
as talented a bunch as he has recruited in
his last four years), apparently is going
to give the younger guys an opportunity
to show what they’ve got.

“It’s considerably the best recruiting
class we’ve had,” said Majors. “The
main reason is that we’re keeping our
eyes open wide for anybody who can
add more speed, more aggressiveness
anywhere we can find it. Any youthful
enthusiasm, people who will ﬁght and
who can run, I’m going to give them
every opportunity I can.”

Some of the changes that Majors
and his staff will be making and have
already made will be starting Seth
Homack at strong safety for the third
straight game, while leading tackler
Curtis McGhee is making the move to
inside linebacker. In the first few games
Hank Poteat was at comerback but is
now back to his natural position, rim-
ning back. Poteat is also giving the
speedy Curtis Anderson a lofty chal-

Redshirt freshman Leon Murray
and true freshman Andy Molinaro have

ondary.

Some of the other new faces we will
be seeing more and more of are Julian
Graham, a redshirt freshman outside
linebacker, Brian and Jason Minehart,

and freshman Nathan Kirby, who is
ninth on the team with 20 tackles in just
five games, as a backup.

“You have to get your younger play-
ers some playing time, some experience.
That’s an advantage for you as you get
older,’’ said Graham.

With all the changes the Panthers
are going through this year and with
some of the younger players taking over
the older players’ jobs, one might think

We continue to provide winners, winners, winners

 

This weekend. in Morgantown, the
once-mighty and once—feared Miami
Hurricanes roll into town for a game which
could tell a lot about whether the Miami
dynasty is indeed dead. The ‘Canes have, on
consecutive weekends, been blown out by
Florida State and East Carolina — East
Carolina — on their home turf and are now
in danger of losing three consecutive games
for the first time since 1984, Jimmy
Johnson’s ﬁrst year as head coach.

Despite all of its prior greatness, Miami

is a fragile program which actually consid-

ered dropping football in the late 1970s. In
the state of Florida, Miami is considered the
rich man’s school, and its popularity is
nowhere near as vast as the University of
Florida’s or Florida State’s. Last week
against East Carolina, the Hurricanes drew
slightly over 30,000 to the 74,0()0—seat
Orange Bowl. Sure, Pitt drew only 30,0()0
for its last home game, but that was to see a
1-5 team playing against Big East doorrnat
Temple. IfPitt’s 4-1 and ranked 12th in the
country, as Miami was, they pack the house.

Compounding Miarni’s problems will
be NCAA probation. The Hurricanes aren’t
barmed from television or bowls, but the
number of scholarships has been cut in half
for last year and this year’s recruiting class-
es. In a state where an astounding 200 play-
ers received Division I scholarships last
year, there’s certainly enough great talent to
go around, even if Florida and Florida State
pick off the bluest of the blue chippers first
The problem for Miami will be depth, and at
a time when even a full-strength program
has only 85 scholarships to work with, any
cut in scholarships can be lethal. West
Virginia 32, Miami 18.

THE PITT NEWS

Thursday, October 24, I996

 

It's The Pitt News Sports Briefing

from local and wire services

Football

- The New Orleans Saints have a head
coach for the rest of the year. Linebacker
Coach Rick Venturi takes over on an
interim basis. He succeeds Jim Mora,
who resigned two days ago.

Venturi was 1-10 as an interim coach

for the 1991 Indianapolis Colts, who ﬁn-
ished l-15.
- The Indianapolis Colts’ running game is
in serious trouble. Zack Crockett is out
for the season following arthroscopic
knee surgery yesterday. Crockett had
missed the last two games after suffering
the injury ina loss to Buffalo.

Colts’ Coach Lindy Infante hopes to
use Marshall Faulk in Sunday’s game at
Washington. Faulk’s injured toe has held
him to 170 yards on 51 carries this sea-
son.

0 The Philadelphia Eagles have made a

pair of moves involving veteran defensive
players. Free agent comerback Johnny
Thomas has signed a one-year deal after
spending last year with the Cleveland
Browns. The Eagles made roster room by
releasing defensive back Barry Wilburn.
- The NFL handed out $73,000in fines to
17 players today. Ten Seattle Seahawks
and seven Kansas City Chiefs are being
fined for a series of incidents during a
game last Thursday.

Basketball

- The new women’s NBA has landed a
pair of Olympic gold medalists who also
won NCAA titles. Rebecca Lobo from
Connecticut’s 1995 championship team
and Sheryl Swoopes of the 1993 NCAA
champions from Texas Tech have signed
two-year contracts with the WNBA.
Neither player has a team because the
league hasn’t announced its eight teams
yet.

Picks

—- The ACC is probably as solid as it’s been
in years with Vlrginia. Georgia Tech and
North Carolina all strong. There’s still a big
gap, however, between Florida State and the
rest of the league. Florida State’s season was
wrecked last year when Virginia stopped the
‘Noles at the one yard line to preserve a
stunning upset. It won’t come down to the
wire this year. Florida State 41, Virginia 8.

USC (4-3) at Washington State (5-2)
-— A Cougar team once renowned for its
defense is making its living this year with
offense, averaging nearly 34 points per
game. Don’t pencil the 5-2 Cougars into the
Rose Bowl just yet -— they still must play

 

 

- UCLA and Washington and they already

there would be some tension
among the players and staff.
However, that has not been the
case, or at least they say it has-
n’t.

“Actually, the older players
are really trying to help the
younger players,” said Brian
Minehait.

Graham’s sentiments sound
like Minehart’s and Majors’.

“I don’t think it’s to make
the older players look bad,”
Graham said. “Sometimes they
do it to try out new talent, and
sometimes it’s about who’s a
better athlete.”

In terms of better athletes,
the Hokies are considerably bet-
ter — especially at quarterback.
All Big-East quarterback Jim
Druckenmiller, who shredded
the Panthers’ secondary in last
year’s 26-9 debacle at Pitt stadi-
um, is out to do it again.

The one thing to look for is
to see how some of the new
faces will react in a hostile stadi-
um during the first quarter. Will
they play the Hokies tough for
the first half (like they did last

i year) or will they fold their hand

FROM PAGE 10 

early in the game like they’ve
been doing for most of the last
four years‘?

Unfortunately for the
Panthers, there is nothing to play
for except pride. And to be quite
honest they haven’t shown much
pride on the field, except for the
Temple victory.

Although they are 2-5 and
near the bottom of the Big East,
Andy Molinaro, one of the true
freshman seeing considerable
playing time this year, put a pos-
itive spin on things.

“I’m glad to see a lot of us
are playing,” said Molinaro.
“We have a chance, if we win
the rest of our games, to go to a
bowl. But the chances of that are
probably slim. So we have to
start building for the future. A lot
of us are doing some good
things, I’m just hoping we can
turn this thing around. I really
think we can.”

We’ve heard this all before,
the optimism, the “let’s get
things turned around and build
for the future” cliches, but
maybe, just maybe it will turn
around.

Proiect Face to Face is both a non-profit organization and an interactive,
viewer-activated installation currently exhibited on the ground ﬂoor of WPU.

Ever heard of the Connie M.
Kimbo Gallery? Chances are you
haven’t, and yet I’m sure you have
been within 10 feet of it a million
times. Go into the union, turn left,
walk past the jazz cabinet of fame and
there it is, probably the most obscure
gallery in Pittsburgh.

This gallery is small, only has two
walls to hang work on, and is thor-
oughly unpublicized, so it just might
also be one of the measliest galleries in
Pittsburgh. But once in a while there is
something there to see, like now. Until
Oct. 21, the Kimbo Gallery presents
“Project Face to Face” sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council. This is an
educational AIDS project in the form
of a multimedia installation and com-
paratively may be one of the more
effective exhibits in the field of AIDS
awareness.

The gallery is full of black panels
with white plaster molds of the faces
of people who are living with AIDS.
The faces are an eclectic group, repre-
senting nearly all ages, races, and
sexes. Each mold is paired with a tape
recorder that plays a three-minute con-
versation with the actual person the
cast was made from. The viewer is left
to walk around the room until a face
draws one in, eager to hear what that
face has to say.

So you see Chava’s on a panel
wearing a bandana around his head
and you walk over to listen to him. You
put a pair of headphones on and you
hear Chava say “no woman is ever

going to want me.” But Chava has an
optimistic message and speaks of
“transcending fear.” After this tape
ends you instinctively move toward
Buddy, the young child in the room.
Buddy begins:

“Hi! — Looks like this is the “on.”
— Hi! Is there a tape in there? Well,
today my cat got killed and I was cry-
1ng.” '

A voice in the background prompts
him: “What was his name?”

“Funnyface.”

A mention of AIDS never comes
about on Buddy’s tape, but others
speak of the realities of the virus. Mary
calls it “the disease that affects every-
thing” as she recounts the ﬁnancial
problems that accompany her afﬂic-
tion. Mary made $80,000 a year and
now she has trouble paying rent.

Another person living with AIDS,
Billy, relates the physical details. He
talks about his lesions, the paralysis
and loss of eyesight that plagues him,
and his uncontrollable bladder, all of
which seem to have stricken him with
a degree of embarrassment and help-
lessness.

There is no excuse to not see this
show because it is minutes from you
right now. You can stop by before your
next class, and if you can disregard the
cramped space, unstable hanging walls
and Hall and Oates blaring from a
radio somewhere in the background,
then you will most likely have a
worthwhile experience.

The Medium

Based on the life and predictions of
Marshall McLuhan

Conceived and Directed by Anne Bogart

I don ’t explain, I explore.

These words of Marshall McLuhan
come to me as I sit and try to write about
what I experienced at the City Theater
this past weekend.

Not unlike the words of the theoreti-
cian, The Medium seems to be a play
that will gamer a response of either
absolute enjoyment or absolute hatred,
my response being absolute: absolute
enjoyment.

What was happening was a perfor-
mance that involved all of the ﬁve sens-
es. .

There is absolutely no inevitability
as long as there is a willingness to con-
template what is happening.

According to the playbill, “The
Medium is composed of a series of
scenes that address the ideas and work
of Marshall McLuhan.” The “scenes”
are almost inseparable, the play being a
large conglomeration of motion and dia-
logue. “The idea is that man began as an
oral creature in an aural (listening) cul-
ture whose world was changed irrevoca-
bly by piint into a visual culture.” Many
of McLuhan’s ideas revolve around the
television, and the new mentality creat-
ed by it, so the play deals mostly with
that particular medium.

The stage looks like a bunch of TV
sets. Metal poles split the stage in half,

The
Renderers
bring their

Zealand to

Beehive.

and then fourths, playing with the idea
of TV inﬁltrating even theater. The
sound is an incredible mix of popular
songs, abstract noises, and even a
thumping heartbeat. The lighting is
harsh, and at times as limiting as on a
tiny TV set. All of these things give the
actors plenty of environmental material
to work with. . ‘

In order to reach people, you have
to hurt them.

The production was created entirely
through improvisations. The company,
Saratoga International Theater Institute,
was created by Anne Bogart and Tadashi
Suzuki. Both are creators of their own
rehearsal and performance techniques,
called, respectively, the Viewpoints and
the Suzuki methods.

Both of these techniques are not
new in substance, just new in theory and
performance. The Viewpoints method is
essentially a philosophy of actor move-
ment within space and time. The Suzuki
method is closely related, dealing (pri-
marily) with the actor’s voice and move-
ment. Together, the two ideas force the
actor to challenge himself and the space
in which he works.

In other words, the way the actors
contort, the way they walk, talk, and
interact, looks like it hurts.

The actors are incredibly trained,
and in such incredible shape, they never
look like they are struggling, making the
movements seem natural.

Instead of a script and actual stage

The Illegitimate Son

Translated by: Kyle Deise and Kiki
Gounaridou

Directed by: Kyle Deise

To me, the most important aspect of
theatre is the relationship between the
audience and the actors. The actual
words of the play are sometimes sec-
ondary because of the personae of the
actors involved. If the actors aren’t very
strong, the words then become impor-
tant. Mr. Deise’s direction seemed to
alienate the audience from the actors’
personae, and since the play’s story isn’t
very interesting, the audience isn’t left
with much.

The story is about a rich—man drifter

staying at his best friend’s house for a
spell. During his stay, he breaks up his
friend’s intended marriage, breaks his
friend’s sister’s heart, and just about
falls in love with his real sister.

The extremely charismatic Brent
Korson plays Dorval, the visitor. He is
on stage from the time the audience
enters the theatre, and stays there for
almost the entire performance. Dorval is
best friends with Clairville, played by
Jeff Detweiler (with an Alfalfa haircut).
Clairvi1le’s ﬁancée is Rosalie, played by
Chris Rath. Dorval and.Rosalie end up
falling in love, making her realize the
mistake she would be making if she
married the self-centered Clairville.

With twists and turns, the story ends

up being a sort of Luke and Princess
Leia incest scare, adding to the feeling
of “datedness” of the play. The final
image is of Rosalie writhing in the dead
leaves on the patio, but I’m left to won-
der why.

Some of the supporting characters
are the most interesting. Justine, played
by Ashley Wells, seems to be a cross
between Lear’s Fool and a Watson—1ike
diarist in the stories of Sherlock
Holmes. Charles, played wonderfully by
Andy Allen, is a stoic servant that keeps
the other characters in line with his wit.

well. You have to know what kind of
theories Mr. Deise is upholding and
undermining. I could see what he was
trying, but couldn’t see why he was try-
ing to do it. With his intentionally life-
less actors, and crisp diagonals and tri-
angles, only the relationships between
the characters could be seen. With no
furthering of the story left up to the
direction, the words became more
important, and because of the nature of
the text, the story more boring. The
awkwardness of the style seemed to hin-
der some of the actors, making Mr.
Deise’s vision even hazier.

Overall, with the lighting, set, and
costumes, the play was interesting to
look at. The direction seemed a bit
heavy—handed, with certain things being
obvious and almost clichéd. Detweiler,
Rath, and Allen were especially com-
fortable with the style and were easily
the highlights. It’s just a shame these
positives couldn’t overcome a horrible
story.

THE PITT NEWS

‘I7

GUnI'l1el' speaks. . .and searches for ways to revitalize the economy

In our society, ART, BUSINESS, and
POPULARITY all go together like cuddly
little furry things, posters, zmd masturbation.
Art is a wonderfully easy way to make
money (at least for collectors and gallery
owners), money makes an go ‘round (35 =
canvas, paint, clay, slides, and contest entry
fees), and money and art can make you pop-
ular (with cash you can buy the best of
friends and with art you are the ultimate
genius hipster). So I am going to give a
wonderful peep into the future of the artists,
the money—makers, and the hipat—heart that
just may act as a great tip towards making
much money and beatnik—type friends.

You probably wonder what it is that can
work the artist world into a gigantic green

orgasm. It can be put into two words: DOPE —

& REHABILITATION. When I was doing
heroin, if I didn’t get to New York City to
get the good DOPE, then we went without
because you could not really have found
any worth a piss—of—a-high in the ‘Burgh.
But now that I am basically clean (at least of
that particular narcotic), it is everywhere,
even and especially the good NYC-kind.
DOPE is now every frat boy’s middle name
on the weekends. And the art world is com-
pletely filled with junkies looking through
every window. Although it is my belief that
DOPE eventually destroys an artist’s ability
to create through blissfully—highass-pain, I
still think it is the great new money—rnaking
frontier that it is.

You see, these rich kids and folks who
die for popularity will do the junk for a
while until it scares the BahHeeBeeJeeBees
out of their tiny—whiney ass and they need
help. While kicking through the shakes,
brain—pain, diarrhea, cold sweats, abdominal
gut-wrenching, and all-around hell and
delusions for three days at the very least is
much too scary for these chaps to kick at
home, going into rehab/detox takes at least
30 days,which would completely kill their
social life. So the easy painless answer for
these lads and lasses is the METHADONE
CLINIC. ‘

I’m not suggesting that there is money
to be made in methadone clinics alone. I
have something else in mind. But as the
young, hip, and artistic many enter the
rapidly expanding number of clinics, there
will be this common idea that it is cool to be
a recovering junky and everyone will be
doing it. That includes the folks who get
addicted to be able to join the cool—as—hell
chnics. Everyone will be doing it and those
everyones are the same young folks that dig
hip music, deep poetry, abstract paintings,
and neat—o coffee houses.

So here it is: METH CLINICS with the
happy hip entertainment the young folks
need so they don’t get bored and complain
with their often lengthy daily visits. First of
all the reception area needs to become a cof-
fee shop so the young and junksick can be
greeted by the smell of freshly—roasted
beans and a good wholesome bagel. But we
don’t need to stop there. Since most in the
METH clinic get hungry and, eventually, fat

we can add both fast food restaurants and
Weight Watchers. OH NO, the moolah does
not stop there!

Music! What do the young like more
than Indie—Rock and what goes better with
dope addicts and coffee than Jazz? So, now
we put a large club or auditorium—type room
in the clinic to have Pavement, Polvo, the
Blues Explosion, and Manny’s local—indie-
heroes play nightly shows. In the
coffee/reception area there will be jazz all
day to keep the mind soothed with the same
feeling that good ol’ DOPE gave us.

And then, since most of these new
junkies are starving artists or their so—called
fans (for lack of the ability to call them
Patrons of the Arts), what do these folks

want more than to show their work? (Well,
maybe another shot of DOPE, but that is
off—limits and beside the point.) So these
 who have never been able to show
their talents or lack thereof anywhere other
than their bedroom walls will now have a
venue. There will be a large gallery in each
clinic and weekly openings of a new artist’s
work and it will be in conjunction with a
Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Two birds
dead with one stone: the artists show and
everybody goes to N .A. What could work
better?

And to top it all off, the required coun-
seling that must be given with the govern-
ment-supplied drugs will be supplied by
psychologists/art instructors and/or critics.

 

 

 .-.....o,,

The full—rounded rehabilitation, entertain-
ment, public exposure, art lessons, lunch,
and a-great-place-to-meet-your-future-
spouse-and—tell—the—1ittle—ones~a]l—about—it
forum make this idea/public dilemma solu-
tion come to a great money—making success
for the brave and ultimately greedy.

So money—‘maker's, dopeheads, and
future aspiring junkies, good luck, break a
leg or a habit, drink caffeine, and just be all-
around happy that good ol’ Gunther saved
your soul and ﬁlled your empty wallet by
living the life that you eventually will live

BLESS, I LOVE YOU!!!

Silver Jews
The Natural Bridge

Drag City

In July 1992 the Silver Jews released The Arizona
Record, much to the delight of avid Pavement fans who
were addicted to lo—ﬁ. To some, this one-track record was
a landmark record, up there with Slanted and Enchanted,
which justiﬁed the lo—ﬁ sound. To others, the Silver Jews
were pretentious con artists who suckered listeners into
paying for sloppy crap.

Which category suits you? Well, if you are a big fan
of Drag City and you understand the use of lo—ﬁ recording
as an expensive tool, then you may already be a Silver
Jews’ fan. For those who are anti—lo—ﬁ, a song like “Secret
Knowledge of Backroa ” is a perfect argument against

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

you. This almost melancholy pop song cannot be compli-
mented better than with the textural, distant sound of lo—ﬁ.

At this point one should understand who the Silver
Jews are. Really, the Silver Jews is D.C. Berrnan, but
through the Jews’ ﬁrst two albums, Bennan is backed up
by Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich (hence the unre-
lenting Pavement references). It was nearly impossible for
Berman to escape an intense Pavement inﬂuence,
although he came closer to doing so on the next album,
Starlite Walker. This record gives birth to the sound that
would begin to deﬁne the Silver Jews. The one-track
method was dropped, but the production remained very
 The problem that arises now is how to describe
this sound with a couple adjectives when this band does
not fall into any neat categories or genres.

Instead of attempting to analyze Starlite Walker in

Thursday, October 24, ‘I996

detail, I’ll get straight to The Natural Bridge because the
two albums are very similar (so if you’re a fan of the Jews’
last album go get their new one). The most striking ele-
ment of this record is the introduction of acoustic instru-
ments, which serves to boost the sound of the Jews a little
closer to the folkish, almost spiritual tendencies their
music used to play with. This may just be an illusion
though, created by Berman’s constant reference to the
Almighty: “I believe the stars are the headlights of angels
driving from heaven to save us.” But whether Berrnan is
singing about Jesus or “General Hospital,” his words are
always witty and insightful.

These mostly acoustic tunes are put against very soft
minimal drums and Berman’s voice, which could be
described as a cross between the monotone singing of Beat

Happening’s Calvin, and the aloofness of Malkmus. So far
this description may turn you off, but there are some good
catchy songs on this album, particularly the non—acoustic.
“The Right to Remain Silent” is an instrumental song that
exempliﬁes Berman’s knack at creating attractive
melodies that dates back to The Arizona Record. The track
“Dallas” is the quintessential Jews song, a mixture of
clever lyrics, a sing—along melody, and yet downplayed -
not at all bombastic or overenthusiastic.

This half—assed description is still very vague at this
point, so if you’re lucky and you skipped down to the last
paragraph, you will get the abridged version of this
review: The Silver Jews latest album, The Natural Bridge,
sounds like late ‘80s Lou Reed, except no one’s singing
about New York City. That’s it.

THE PITT NEWS

Nirvana
From the Banks of the Muddy Wishkah
DGC

Why Nirvana? Why now? Why, to make some more
money for Getfen and Company, of course! Why else?
Why not?

Nirvana was one of the greatest pop bands to ever
actually succeed in the pop music realm (ﬁnancially, that
is), and this really should be the last chance (for at least a
year) for Geffen to cash in on the Success that the band
enjoyed before it became so unenjoyable for Mr. Cobain
that he had to end it all.

After Cobain’s death, every 12-year-old suburban kid
and his mother went hog wild buying up all of Nirvana’s
albums, T—ShirtS, and even bootlegs. Almost every Semi-

21

 

serious Nirvana fan out there already has at least a cassette
copy of one of those bootlegs, for instance the “Live over
Europe” boot, which is a recording of a full set during
Nirvana’s In Utero tour, with second guitar player Pat
Smear adding a little extra oomph to the sound. Other
boots have demo versions of early songs and covers. This
is one of the reasons that From the Banks of the Muddy
Wtshkah feels like rehash. The main reason is that it is
rehash.

Nirvana as a phenomenon and as a band was basical-

Sound

knows not what it means,” etc). More than
a few casual references to guns and lyrics
betraying a selﬁsh desire to be rid of the
weight of a world he did not yet bear are
just some of the clues Cobain left for ama-
teur rock critics/fans with bad complexions
to overanalyze and speculate about.

The entire “MTV Unplugged” show
(which could be seen as a companion piece
to this “loud rock” release, focusing on the
“soft & touching” ﬂip side of the band)
was played into the dirt by teary—eyed kids
who found a certain. meaningful irony in
Cobain’s choice of covers by Bowie (“I
thought you died alone a long long time
ago”) and Leadbelly. Shortly before his
death (you’ll recall Nirvanamania was still
in full swing even pre-suicide), I went to
see my little brother’s
band play at a junior
high talent show in the
suburbs. The band
before his played the
Vaselines’ “Molly’s
Lips.” Perhaps they
were 13-year-old
Vaselines fans. More
likely, they were play-
ing a cover of
Nirvana’s rendition of
“Molly’s Lips.” I hope
I’m not being too cynical when I speculate
that they probably had never even listened

t to the Vaselines. I left the school auditori-

um that evening feeling pretty ambivalent
about the whole thing. On one hand, I was
glad that punk rock had hit the junior high
in one form or another, but on the other
hand I was bummed out that its incarnation
was that of a cheerleader with purple hair
trashing a song by a great band.

This is all beside the point, though.
The real reason for Nirvana’s success (as
opposed to 99 percent of the other altema—
tive bullshit to crop up in their wake) is that
they were simply better than any of the
other bands on MTV at the time of their
“breakthrough.” Punk rock and the main-

stream had intersected in the past, and the A

impact that each force had on the other one

made it inevitable that they would meet
again. Most indie and/or underground
bands are aware on some level of what’s
going on in the mainstream, but it is sel-
dom that the reverse is true. Mainstream
means money, and the eyes of the powers-
that—be are only opened after their noses
smell the potential for proﬁt.

This brings me back to this “new”
Nirvana disc. Sure, it’s a great album. I lis-
tened to it twice right after it came in the
mail (though not since then). There’s even
a couple songs that come across better on
this disc, with its cleaned up sound (almost
everything is mixed by Scott Litt of REM
production fame) than the multitude of
bootleg versions out there. In particular, a
few things stand out; “Floyd the Barber”
sounds better than ever,
for instance. The vocals

on most boots (what else
did you expect from the
folks at Geffen?) and it’s
sure to be cheaper than
the average $30 boot
CD  and a hell of a lot
more expensive than
simply taping such a
disc off my brother.

as big a Nirvana fan as they come. When I
told him the other day that Geffen sent us
the disc, he was only casually interested,
obviously having heard it all before. Then
he told me that he just picked up the
Stooges F unhouse and Sebadoh’s Bubble
& Scrape, and I was proud as hell. I’ve
played him both albums in the past, and
always tried to spark his interest in folks
like Iggy and the pre—Bakesale Sebadoh.
He said that he was ordering the Velvets’
box set next.

So, as frustrating as life can get for a
real rock fan in this post—altemative realm
passing for reality these days, the trickle-
down effects are not all bad. Neither, obvi-
ously, are they all good. The same could be
said for this album. Merry Christmas.

Iﬂedhuhl

directions, the play was created through
rehearsal improvisations. This method of
creation is inherent in the ideas of Anne
Bogart. Seeing the movements for the

. ﬁrst time, they look as though they are

being created as we watch. After a second
viewing, it shows they are extremely pre-
cise, and rigorously practiced. This
dichotomy gives the show a feeling of
both freedom and containment, not usual-
ly seen in a more conventional produc-
tion.

The first part of the production is dur-
ing the moments of McLuhan’s stroke
and the actors’ movements depict the way
a stroke patient moves. Moving then into
different scenarios such as a sitcom, the

 

old West, and even a game show, the play
becomes a summary of McLuhan’s life.
Ending with a breakdown, the play
becomes a circle, ending where it began.

The medium is the message, not the
content.

On the surface, this quote ﬁts perfect-
ly with The-Medium. It can be enjoyed
simply bywatching. It is visually spectac-
ular, giving life to McLuhan’s theories.
But if you pay attention to the words, and
look at the juxtaposition between the
words and music, there is something
deeper. But as to what that something
deeper is, see my ﬁrst quote, then see The
Medium. _
