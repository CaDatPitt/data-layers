Energy Measures Detailed

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

Since President Nixon delivered
his energy policy address Sunday.
the debate and developments
surrounding the nation's critical
fuel shortage have accelerated
dramatically.

Nixon outlined the following
proposals in his televised speech:
--a 15 per ‘cent cut in gasoline
deliveries to wholesale and retail
dealers, effective immediately;
--a 5 per cent reduction in jet fuel
allocations for domestic airline
ﬂights, effective immediately;

--a voluntary ban of retail Sunday
gasoline sales;
--a nationwide speed-limit imposi-

$75 SG Campaign Spending Limit Set

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

An election code section allowing
unlimited campaign spending for
the January Student Government
elections was repealed by a 5-0 vote
in an emergency Board meeting
last night.

The election code was passed in
its entirety by the Board Wednes-
day night in a 4-0 vote. One of the

reasons, Board member Tom
Bailey said. was to make the
elections less of a personality
contest. -

Wording of the repealed section
reads: “A Maximum of $50.00 is
suggested to be spent on a
candidate’s entire campaign.
Spending over $75.00 is prohibited.
lt is highly suggested that receipts
be turned into the SGEC prior to
the election to guard against
disputes of this nautre.”

This wording changes a stipula-
tion in last year's election code
which mandated candidates to
submit campaign spending re-
ceipts. According to sources. this
procedure was difficult to enforce.

It was also reported that some
members of the present Board
failed to comply with that regula-
tion. _

Prior to the emergency Board
meeting. Election Committee
Chairperson Betty Nelson said she
wasn't satisfied with the section
which allowed unlimited campaign
spending.

“However,” Nelson explained,
“Neither the Board. nor the
Committee have come up with a
proposal that would be reasonable
for the candidates and-feasible for
the Board to enforce.”

After the repeal. Nelson said.
“Knowing the dangers of not
having a campaign spending limit.
this is a good alternative. but it is
not perfect."

She added that regulations such
as these are difficult to enforce.

However. candidates who break
the code will presumably be
disqualified.

Nelson said she would like to
draw up a proposal now. that next
year's election committee could

work with “to eliminate the yearly

hassle of campaign spending."
President Rege Kaufman was

asked what would happen to

candidates whose campaign was‘

contested and who failed to turn in
the receipts.

the receipts they're not going to

No Winter UAR Scheduled

BY DEBBlE POPP

The Undergraduate Academic
Review will not be published for
distribution this winter term.

Ira Dichtcr. member of both the
Provost Task Force on the
Undergraduate Bulletin and the
Student Government Allocations
Committee, outlined the tentative
schedule and new format of the
UAR.

Letters will be send to professors
explaining time has expired and
the UAR will not be able to
evaluate all their classes.

Copies of the evaluations already
processed this term will be printed
and left on the ninth floor of the
Cathedral for student reference.‘

Financing for this evaluation will
come from the office of the Dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences
and not from the Allocations
Committee.

ln February new course descrip-
tions by the teaching professors
will be printed in the time schedule

for fall registration. These
descriptions will include course
content. workload. and testing

requirements.

One page of this booklet will also
explain how student opinion will be
used in future editions.

Finally in the 1975 winter term a
complete book combining course
description, time. schedule, and
student evaluations will be pu-

..-~...bl_i.sh¢d-

.'e-‘

The main thrust of the new
bulletin. Dichter said. is to get the
proper information out to the
students so they can intelligently
select classes.

According to Dichter the UAR
diluted its goals by trying to
provide information and student
opinion with teaching evaluation.

“We are divorcing these two
problems in the one booklet to be
published by the University.
Course information and student
opinion usually passed through the
grapevine will be the one function
of the UAR,” he said.

who contend they are not stringent
enough.

i A controversy has mushroomed
over the possibility of gas-rationing
presenting itself as the only viable
solution to the petroleum short-
ages. Nixon has said he opposes
such as alternative. but concedes
his own measurers may not be
enough. ’

“While additional actions will be
necessary to further offset the
anticipated shortage of 17 per
cent,” Nixon said, “the steps
which I have proposedgiwill relieve
about 10 percent of it.” He
expressed the hope that the
balance could be drawn from an
estimated inventory of 1.] billion
barrels.

a leading oil economist, told a New
York Times’ interviewer that “the
Administration continues to fail to

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, ‘I973 ‘

President Nixon is dragging his‘

feet because he knows that the
necessary measures will be un-
popular."

Senator Henry Jackson, a propo-
nent of gas—rationing, suggested
the Government “move forward

with a program of rationing on a

stand—by basis. so that it can be
implemented overnight." Jackson
refuted any notions that a 30-40
cent federal tax on each gallon of
gasoline would counteract the
crisis. 4

We shouldn’t permit a person to
buy his or her way out that the poor
and working people will not be able
to afford,” Jackson said. “We
must have an equitable sharing of
the burden. They will see the
equity in a rationing program when
they have to wait in line for
gasoline.”

The Arab oil
withdrawn 3 million barrels of oil

embargo has.

per day from the US. where the‘ '

economy normally requires 19.6
million barrels for a typical winter
day.

The Administration's forecasts
of a 17 per cent fuel shortage fall

well below Congressional calcula-g

tions of a 25-30 percent deﬁcit.
Pessimistic observers believe the

U.S. could be forced tooperate at a '

loss of 5 million barrels per day-
Nixon's proposed measures will
only cover a 2 million barrel deﬁcit.

Energy planners in two federal
agencies said Wednesday that
consumer coupons are growing
increasingly attractive and the
President may be forced to submit
to a rationing program out of sheer
necessity.‘ ,.

The basic gas allotment could.
range anywhere front 10 to 15
gallons per week, and the coupon
would be transferable. An inherent
danger of the program would be
the creation of a “white market,”
where coupons might conceivably
float from one household
another.

Already. the Government has
promised that in January the
reduction in gasoline deliveries to
retail dealers will be doubled from

~15 per cent to 30. But crit_ies have

contended the Administration is
relying too heavily on voluntary
cutbacks. such as

Spending Limit Settled

(Editor’s note: The Student
Government Board repealed
Article V, section II of the election
code at an emergency meeting
Thursday night. The ‘section
permitted unlimited Campaign
spending. See story page 1.)

BYBRIANDUNN
Dropping a mandatory $50
campaign spending limit was

among the election code changes
proposed by Student Government
Board (SGB) Wednesday.

Board member Tom Bailey
suggested unlimi_ted campaign
spending would make the election
less of a personality contest.

“I think this is a big university
and it’s time we started acting like
one,” said Bailey. “If a guy has
the financial support, why should
he be denied his chance?”

Bailey also mentioned the diffi-
culty involved in determining the
exact amount each candidate had
spent. He felt cutting regulations
would reduce post-election ap-
peals.

Board member Bob Heister
warned the campaign “could
become a big money thing," and
President Rege. Kaufman said he
would rather “stress _the impor-
tance of personal contact."

At the proposal of SGB membei
Mike —Furick, the Board voted in 4-0
a proposal suggesting a $50 limit
on campaign spending. The Board
agreed to be lax in its enforcement.

According to Betty Nelson,
chairperson of the Student Govern-
ment Election Committee, the
proposed S50 limit would have
ended yearly changes in campaign
funding policy. In past campaigns,
the imposed spending limits have
varied.

Kaufman also announced the SGB
must interest at least 350 people to
be able to charter a plane to
Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl next
month. “We have to get a feel for

' Pitt
$1.50

how many want to go or we might
as well forget about the whole
thing."

In other business, Kaufman
revealed he has received letters
from Democratic state Senators
Thomas F. Lamb and Frank
Mazzei, responding to an SGB
resolution urging support of
legisla.tion lowering the state
drinking age to 19.

Lamb said he is the sponsor of
Senate Bill No. 1292, which would

put the drinking issue to a
referendum in the 1974 primary
election. “Should it be enacted, I
would be guided by the results of
the referendum in further enfran-
chising our young citizens,” Lamb
said.

Referring to the SGB resolution,
Mazzei said, “I appreciate having
it before me and assure you of its
consideration at such time as this
legislation is before me in the
senate.”

Throughout the months, I have

majority of the officers respect the
students and their opinions, and
feel that the real power of action at
Pitt lies with the student body as a
whole, a fact which most of the
students do not even realize. A list
of people the police have trouble
with would not place students first,
but would appear as follows:

1.---Campus Police administra-
tors

2---Outsiders (non-students)
hassling students

3---Self-important faculty mem-
bers who refuse to obey rules,
regulations, and laws

4---Students breaking the law or
hassling other students

The group at the head of the list
has, in the past, created some of
the most serious problems for all
parties concerned. I have nothing
personal against the administrators
as individuals, but I have seen
harmful results of apparently hasty
decisions made by the top men.

Occasionally, the orders have
been as potentially hazardous to
students as to the officers. I
attribute most of these bad policies
to simple errors of judgment. The
administrators are human and
make mistakes just as anyone else
does.
human too, and I believe they have
a point when they claim that some
bad policies are made because the
top men don’t understand exactly
the ever-changing problems en-
countered on campus.

Our patrolmen tackle problems
unique to the Pitt campus, which
the administrators would nothave
dealt with; regardless of the
number of years of their experience
in other places. Hopefully, the
upcoming changes in administra-
tive personnel will lead to more
cooperation at all levels.

The campus police have recently.

Abortion

Dear Ms. Sexton:

Both James Buzonas and
Michael Pastorkovich have dis-
played the sour-grapes attitude
which is typical of people who have
been publicly defeated. _

For Pastorkovich’s -information,
neither Buzonas nor myself have
any connections with either the
Student _Health Service or the
Medical Action Committee. These
two organizations established cer-.
tain ground-rules for the debate to
which both Jim and I agreed:
Those rules applied equally to both
of us and both of us agreed to these
rules in the presence of the Medical
Action Committee. Included
among those rules were stipula-
tions as to the subject of the

number of speakers, selection of a
moderator, use of visual aids, etc.
If these parameters were unsatis-
factory to either party, the time for
complaint was when the rules were
formulated.

In short, there was absolutely no
“engineering” involved in the
debate. -

Mr. Pastorkovich, however, has
inadvertently underscored the
major thrust of my entire argu-
ment, which was that Buzonas (and
anti-abortionists in general) did not
know what he was talking about. If
Buzonas is so pitifully lacking in
expertise about the after-effects of
abortion, then he should never
have brought up the subject in the
pages of the Pitt News. As a
matter of fact, he admitted to the
members of MAC and to myself
that he did not know about the

Grand Jury D/'\’s ploy

Trial System Needs to be Updated

(DPPA) Now that Pennsylvania voters have
decided that the various courts of common pleas in
the commonwealth should have the right to eliminate
the indicting grand juryjif they wish, it's time that
Allegheny County judicial officers take a look at two
out-moded, anachronistic systems--the grand jury
and the county magistrate system.

These two systems are linked tightly together and

any change in one will assuredly affect the other. «

When the grand jury system was initiated in 14th
Century England, it was used to protect serfs and
commoners from the scurrilous‘ claims of lords or
landowners. Only a grand jury of serfs could bring
another serf to trial, regardless of the pressure of the
lord.

In the 20th Century United States, however, there
are no lords and society isn’t so stifﬂy stratified.

What then becomes the use of the grand jury?

Proponents of the indicting grand jury, su‘ch as
County Sheriff Eugene, L. Coon, call it the “final
safeguard to eliminate cases that should not go to
court.” ‘

Coon said that 15 to 20 percent of all cases handed »

up from a justice of the peace are thrown out by the
grand jury. If the grand jury is eliminated those
cases will go to -court. Coon maintains that
regardless of whether a man is proved innocent, the
fact that he went on trial is deliterious of his
reputation. A man. who goes on trial gets adverse
publicity from the media and his image is damaged.

It may be true that a man going to trial will receive
some adverse publicity, but Coon evades one large
point--is not a grand jury indictment equally, if not
more damning? '

Media-critic Fred Friendly reports that only 20
percent of all crime news is reported in the
newspapers. Of those trials reported, 73 percent are
mentioned in only one story, when the trial is
finished and the verdict given. .

Further, most trial news, save large cases, is
scattered throughout the pages of a newspaper and
shoved into obscure corners. Little of this news ever
reached the broadcast medium.

Contract this with a grand jury indictment. When

" a person reads JOE DOAKES INDICTED FOR

ASSAULT AND BATTERY, his first reaction is to
translate “indict” for “found guilty of.” This, of
course, is a faulty translation, but, sadly, it happens.
Consequently, many prospective jurors are pre-
judiced by a simple word.

Semantically, the difference between the
indictment headline and JOE DOAKES FOUND
INNOCENT OF ASSAULT AND BATTERY
CHARGES is mammoth. A person who might have
been swayed by the grand jury indictment is now
simply told that Mr. Doakes is innocent.

The most fundamental tenet of our system of
jurisprudence is that a man is innocent until proved
guilty. Because a grand jury indictment is so often
taken to imply guilt, that system is not serving
justice.

But the flaws in the grand jury hardly stop there.
Not only does the grand jury work against one‘s
presumed innocence, it has become a tool of the
District Attorney. I

Cyril H. Wecht, county coroner, recounted four
alledgedly

time limits,

format, (Continued on Page 5)

manipulated by DA Robert Duggan to suit his
political needs. In these four cases, city police
officers underwent a coroner’s inquest looking into
their role in shooting incidents. The coroner’s jury

- found enough evidence to turn the cases over to the

grand jury, where Duggan would argue against the
officers. * _
In all four cases, the grand jury dismissed the

officers. To Wecht, the curious point is this: in a ’

grand jury hearing, the defendant doesn’t present
his case, but in a coroner’s inquest he does. Without

uttering a word to his defense, each police officer was

released and charges were dropped. While a
coroner’s jury, after hearing both sides of the case,
found enough evidence to turn it over to the grand
jury, the grand jury found insufﬁcient evidence for a
trial.

Wecht sees only one explanation. He maintains
that DA Duggan made his cases weak enough that
the grand jury had no recourse but to throw them out.
Wecht said that Duggan did this only to jockey for
political support from the Pittsburgh police.

Such practices are not isolated to Allegheny

County. Nationwide, the grand jury is nothing more I

than a political tool of the DA. If the district attorney
has a trial he would rather not see in court, he can
make his case weak enough so that it is‘ dropped.
Conversely, if public pressure is on him for a
prosecution, the DA can manipulate the grand jury
into a favorable position.

But if the indicting grand jury is eliminated, as it
should be, sweeping changes must come in the
County magisterial system.

Allegheny County has 64 Magisterial Districts,
each presided over by a justice of the peace. "To
qualify as a justice of the peace, one must be a
member of the bar or complete a course oftraining
and instruction in the duties of his ofﬁce. One need
not have had any legal experience and, indeed, with
the course of instruction, one need not be a lawyer.

But if the grand jury is eliminated, the justice of
the peace will serve a vital role. All court
proceedings will begin either with an information
filed by the DA or the recommendation of a justice of
the peace. If the JP has no legal perception, then the
courts may be filled with cases that should not be
there.

a County JP’s will have to be well-versed in the finer
points of jurisprudence. They must have a sharp
knowledge of the law and what constitutes a crime.
The job will no longer be suited for a political hack
who is interested only in the vain glory of a title
before his name.

If the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas
decides it no longer wants the indicting grand jury,
then the County Government Study Commission
must take its cue and rewrite the duties and
qualiﬁcations of the justice of the peace. With the

Commission drafting its Home Rule Charter, this is a

near-perfect time to re-evaluate the JP’s role. -

The grand jury, in its sixth century, is nothing
more than a senseless tradition--one tradition of
English Common Law that American justice can do
without. -

But to eliminate the grand jury without making
other legal changes--especially concerning the
magisterial system--would be intolerably Procru-
stean solution.

medical after-effects, having only
read about them in some anti-
abortion publications. I proved the
authors of those publications to be
liars, a fact which neither Jim nor
his physician-assistant were able to
refute. In the September 17, 1973
issue of the Pitt News, Buzonas
claimed that my assertion con-
cerning the non-existence of
long-range complications following
medically induced abortion was
“enough to put any pro-lifer into
laughing hysterics.” And yet, not
once during the course of the entire
debate did he even address himself
to that aspect of the issue.

Having found that they cannot
dissuade women from obtaining
abortions with blatant emotion-
alism, fetus-fotos and the like,
anti-abortionists arenow trying to
frighten women from having
abortions by deliberately falsifying
material on the -medical after-
effects. On November the 8th, I
proved that the claims made by
anti-abortionists of sterility,
difficulty with later pregnancies,
etc. following medically induced
abortions are untrue. _ » -

I am a scientist, having earned a
bachelor’s degree in physics to
which has been added special
training in population, biology, and
genetics. In addition, I have
researched abortion from (among
others) the medical, legal, histori-
cal, social, and ethical standpoints.
There is absolutely no scientiﬁc
basis anywhere that supports the
contention that abortion is murder.
That contention derives from a
moral, not a scientific, judgment
and, as such, cannot be afﬁfmed or
denied. It is a belief, no more and
no less. Although the concept that
abortion is murder is taught by
some institutions to be a scientific
truth, there is no more scientific
basis for this than years ago that
the earth was the center of the
universe. .

If you believe that abortion is
murder, then it is so. For those of

that’s okay, too. Both positions are

equally admirable, but neither
should become state policy. The
Supreme Court placed this ques-
tion exactly where it should be,
within the realm of individual
conscience. ,

The opportunity was offered for
both sides to give a well-reasoned
and well-researched presentation
of their respective views on the
medical aspects of this subject.
Only I took advantage of that
opportunity. The only evidence
that Buzonas could give concerning
bias in pro-abortion statistics was
his own word, which was no proof
at all.

It has been shown that anti-
abortionists are incapable of
discussing this subject from a
scientific or rational position
preferring, instead, to argue the
unarguable. For this reason,
further debate, as well as further
correspondence, would be useless.
Like it or not, abortion is.

The moral issues can be decided
very well by each woman for
herself without her ever feeling the
need (or desire) to contact
Buzonas, me, or anyone else for
our views. As a male, I will not be
party to an unresolvable and futile
debate about the alleged morality
of what happens inside a woman’s
uterus.. Quite simply, I have no

Commuting

Dear Editor,

Being a commuter has its good
points and its bad points. It is one
of these bad points I would like to
discuss here. After battling traffic
for almost an hour, I, arrive on
campus at approximately’ 8:30.
Since my day runs from 9:00 a.m.
until 3:00 p.m., it would cost me a
small fortune to feed parking
meters all these hours. So as a
result, I resort to the Trees Hall lot
since it costs a mere 60 cents per
day. The nextproblem is getting
down the hill to the main campus.
In nice weather, the walk isn’t bad.
But as it gets colder and windier,
the walk gets longer and longer. so

I

And More Letters

I decide to take advantage of that
luxurious vehicle known as the

. campus bus.

Since I’ve - just missed the so
called 8:30 bus, I realize I’ll have a
short wait. So, how long does it
take the bus to loop the campus,
not 15 minutes, not 20 minutes as
one would expect, but a grand total
of 30 minutes. Nowwe all know,
this couldn’t have been a direct
trip. Okay, so he is entitled to a
morning coffee break. I’ll forgive
him. When he finally arrives, it’s
so good to get on a nice warm bus,
that I forget all my built up
hostilities.

So I'm off on my adventure down
the steepest hill in the city. But the
faithful campus bus driver must
have a built in sense of adventure.
(I see no other reason for flooring
the accelerator on a hill that closely
resembles a l80‘degree angle
straight up and down.)

When I open my eyes again
we’re fast approaching Benedum
Hall, which marks about the
halfway point in my trip, since I’m
headed for David Lawrence Hall.
You’ll never know what aggrava-
tion is until the faithful campus bus
driver ‘slowly grinds to a halt in
front of Benedum Hall and
exclaims “15 minute layover.”
Taking a break on consecutive trips
is a bit much, especial1y‘when the
trip amounts to a 15 minute ride. It
can’_t be all that exhausting ﬂicking
that lever back and forth to open
the door.

Since it is now almost 9:10 and
my first class begins at 9:00, I have
no choice but to get off the bus and
walk the remainder of the way,
arriving at class at 9:15, thus
making my trip down the hill a 45
minute venture, one that you could

i   A ‘Friday,yN'ovember30,1973+-'l‘HE'lPlT'll NEws’—‘Pa},ét§

walk in 15 minutes.

In’ conclusion, I see as my only
alternatives: 1) leaving home one
hour earlier and catching the 8:00
campus bus, which involves getting
up before 6:00 for a 9:00 class??? or
2) walking down the hill, arriving
on time for class, but windblown
and frozen. Alternative one is
obviously ridiculous and unneces-
sary, so that leaves my second
choice: walking. Okay, I'll walk,
but, I ask, why then do we have a
campus bus???

Bradford

Dear Sir; .
In reference to your October 29
article on relocation, the interest

shown in the Bradford Campus was
admirable. Unfortunately it would
have been much more timely and
appropriate a year ago. Since then
the system referred to has been
completely changed so that there is
now much more faculty and student

interest and interplay and thus;
more effective dissemination -of 
information, a fact which a casual.T7:.'5
phone call to the Bradford Campus‘ 2- '57
would have revealed. Other than (:2;
that one slight oversight, your 

article was most illuminating.

It’s a crash course in parody.

First, you see the Mad Magazine
--like advertisements in the news-
papers--an obvious parody on
advertising, movies, and parodies
themselves. Then you see the
movie, titled The.Long Good-bye,
which is a parody on movies.’
While you’re watching the movie,
and if you don’t have ear muffs on,
you hear the music--a parody on
film music. Then you go home and
read the novel that the film was
adapted from, Raymond Chand-
ler’s The Long Good-bye. His
noyel, although basically a mystery
story, is scattered with enough
comments on writers, to warrant a
slight taste of parody. Like I said,
it's a crash course in parody.

I don’t want to waste the Pitt
News‘ precious space on the plot
because the film wasn’t produced
for plot’s sake. But‘ for kicks,
there’s a beautiful Nina van

alcoholic writer, a supposed sui-
cide, and corruptable police. ; A

of reasoning, a number of

I’m not like that. I just think that
those reviewers are full of shit.

dark spot on a bright, sexy, social

background. Completely con-
trasted with drugged, nude,
candlemakers who live next door to
Marlowe, the two opposite poles
are even better deﬁned. The
excellently constructed character-
ization leads to Altman’s well
defined comment on Hollywood

, and its people.

Altman never lets the audience
forget that The Long Good-bye is a
movie about movies. With the use
of camera shots and physical
movements, Gould is protrayed
within a Bogart image. Several of
the film’s scenes are very similar to
memorable scenes from past
movies. Altman inserts an
impersonater gate keeper. ~ His
specialty?--film characters.

The camera work is smooth,
slow, and pulsating, much‘like
Marlowe and the film itself. The

Irreverence and the common

Chong have seen the viewpoint of a

For the PUTPOSC of
voters’ registration, a woman has
the right to continue to use her
given or maiden name after
marriage. She is not required to
change her name to that of her
spouse. according to a ruling
issued by the attorney general at
the request of the Pennsylvania
Commission on the Status of
Women.

The opinion states that a woman
may use any name she chooses for
the purpose of registering to vote,
as long as she uses that name
consistently for identiﬁcation.

During its recent credit investi-
gation, the commission received
numerous complaints from married
women who were denied the right
to use their given or maiden name

He studied at Cornell and at the Air

architecture, but that trip didn't ﬁt.

“From there Harry made a
beginning in the ﬁlm business--he
got a job packing crates...and
eventually made documentary
ﬁlms of his own.”

.In his youth he had a folk act.

The Provider only knows what
horrors the man suffered. But, in
1971 Harry and his brothers rented
the Village Gate in New York. That
was the beginning. Expanding his
act there into a small band Harry,
drew larger and larger crowds at

the Village Gate, until he ﬁnally ‘

landed a contract with Elecktra

His ﬁrst album, Heads and
Tales, was a success. “His songs

students. Five hours daily, 5 days per
week (12-16 weeks) the course is
given in the country where the student’
will attend medical school.

In addition, Euromed provides stu-
dents with a 12 week intensive cul-‘

ting the President’s program, we
must recognize, as he did, that
these steps. even if completely
successful, will offset only about“
10% of the shortage.

“It is quite clear that the U.S.
must be prepared to take. more
far-reaching steps to bring the
consumption of oil products under
control as rapidly as possible."

To insure an equitable opportun-
ity for consumption, Nixon signed
the Emergency Petroleum Alloca-
tion Act of 1973 on Tuesday, a bill
which he had voiced dissatisfaction
with recently. ' It obligates the
President to set up an allocation
program for petroleum and all
refinery products within thirty
days.

The bill would prevent the

energy crisis from striking one»

region or independent distributor
more severely than another,
particularly if the latter is not
affiliated with a major oil company.

Another development in the fuel
shortage situation has materialized
in the mass job layoffs in the
aviation industry. Cessna Aircraft
Company is scheduling to release

‘2,400 of its employees py January’

Of primary concern in the

With the concern over the energy
"crisis snowballing. talk of utilizing
nuclear energy to produce power
‘ has intensiﬁed. A

' _Worldwide, there are 200 nuc-
=f lear power plants either in the
 planning stage or in various _stages
 of construction. Seventy-ﬁve of
rﬁthese plants use reactors built by
,_,Westi'nghouse.

1  Most of the existing reactors are
flight-water reactors which, accord-
ing to Westinghouse, cost approxi-
"mately $600 million. ‘
 , A Westinghouse breeder re-
actor, still in experimental stages,
;,,is_ ‘being tested by the Tennessee
‘'-‘.Valley Authority (TVA). This
' reactor, produces its own fuel, and
' costs about $700 million. Of this
‘cost, Westinghouse pays about
:.$7.3 million, the utilities pay about
’.-‘$270 million, and the Government
.'”picks up the remainder of the tab.

   
   
   
  

V‘ presently takes approximately ten
years. This is due to the time
consuming licensing procedure
j required by the Atomic_ Energy
* 'Com’mission (AEC).'A permit must

_construction. r

-Construction of these plants

 

Energy:

According to Romano Salvatori,
Manager of the Nuclear Safety
Department at Westinghouse this
time might be reduced to 6 years, if
construction and licensing are done
simultaneously.

“Right now, when plans for a
plant are finished, licensing by the
AEC must take place before
construction commences, and after
it is completed. In the future, to
shorten theibuilding time, we hope
to have construction and licensing
going on simultaneously.”

Concern has been" expressed
about radiation leaks from nuclear
power plants. Salvatori said that
the amount of radiation given off by
a plant is inﬁnitesimile. “At the
boundary of a plant, the radiation
level is about 5 millirems.‘ and a
normal chest X-ray gives off 150
millirems." _

Salvatori believes this concern
relates to a fear the public has of
nuclear energy, possibly because

they relate it with nuclear weapons. V

An equal concern of skeptics of
nuclear energy has been the
danger in event of a nuclear plant
accident. With respect to the
safety record of’ nuclear power

- plants, the American Nuclear,

‘personnel

A Viable Alternative

Society (ANS)stated, “No licensed
nuclear power plant in the U.S. has
ever caused property damage or
injury to the public or operating
as a result of the
fissionable or radioactive character
of the process in more than 100
reactor years of operation.” There
have been nuclear reactor acci-
dents but the safety and backup
systems in the plant usually
prevented extensive damage ANS
said. “There have been failures of
equipment and human errors as
would be expected in any complex
system such as nuclear power
plants. However in every instance
the safety equipment designed into
the plant terminated the accident

without injury to the operators or

the public.”

Many tax payers feel that the
expenses of a nuclear power plant
are too high for pragmatic
consideration. Salvatori again
disputes this argument. He said,
that in the long run production of
nuclear power is less expensive
than fossil fuel plants, because
nuclear plants ‘are. cheaper to
operate, and do not necessitate
additional costs such as pollution
control devices.-

Pittsburgh, with the location of
Westinghouse Corporation’s main
office, has become one of the
world’s major nuclear centers.

Bernard L. Cohen, Director of the

ment'has been pouring signiﬁcant-
ly more money into research

Before the change in the code,
Black Action Society (BAS) Chair-
man Bill Kilson said the proposal
was discriminatory. “It’s de-

probably be

-finitely discriminatory to those

students who don’t have money or
access to funds.

“There are too many examples
in American politics of improprie-
ties in election campaign funding to
make the same mistakes here on
campus,” Kilson said.

Warning of setting too high a
limit, Kilson added, “If the limits
are too high then it is favorable to
those students who have money
and unfavorable for those who
don’t. Any limit might be unfair.”

Tom Bailey, past Student
Government president and current
Board member, said why he
favored unlimited campaign

spending.
“We wanted to make less
hassles for the election com-

mittee,” Bailey explained. .‘.‘It is

so hard.to appraise the campaign‘ ,

materials. (and the process of
handling the receipts) that we
didn’t want to make it hard on the

“I don’t think that anyone has an

It is Thursday, 7:30.

“As a kid I had two strange-
ambitions. One, to be .a mailman
getting bitten by stray dogs. with
all that fresh outdoorsy stuff...the
other, to be a drugstore cowboy
sitting at the soda fountain
drinking warm Doctor pepper. I
call this poem “Zimmer the
Drugstore Cowboy.”

But Paul Zimmer, assistant
director of the University _of
Pittsburgh Press, instructor at
CMU. poet and drugstore cowboy
is a lot more exciting than warm
Doctor Pepper.

“I went to Kent State after high
school, and at the end of my
freshman year had a .3 average.
From there I went to work in the
steel mills, but there was ,a strike
and then! got drafted into the
Korean War. I dragged around
Korea for a while, came back to
Ohio and back to Kent State.

“I spent three years trying‘to
raise my QPA so that I could get
married." Although he didn't

 . graduate. Zimmer did get married.

But. Kent State didn’t forget him.

After;his first book. The Ribs of
Death, was published he was
invited back for a reading. His
degree was conferred‘ on the spot.

The Thursday night reading was
part of the Poets on Poetry series
sponsored by Ideas & Figures and
COTA, the committee on the arts.
Zimmer read for about an hour to a
small but receptive audience.

Self-recognition is an integral
part of Zimmer's poetry. He has a
repetoire of “Zimmer” poems,
ostensibly written by Walt Whit-
man and other equally famous
artists. “At one time I didn't see
myself as a poet," said Zimmer,
“therefore I relied on this
technique of autobiography to
build-up my confidence."

Zimmer finds poetry a lonely,
individual process. “It is a
singular business," he said with a
smile. “You get three poets
together in any one place and
they'll probably destroy each
other."

Unlike many of his comtem-'
poraries, Zimmer sees forms as an
important- element in poetry. He
has an “instinct” about forms,
when to use them, and how to use

' them. “I’ve written many sonnets,

as well as’ other forms...sometimes

and not a dream.

it just feels right. It ﬁts.”

“Poets are just recovering from
the ‘bookish’ T.S. Eliot style."
Zimmer emphasized that poetry is
evolving into more of a popular art
form than it had been. “There is
nowta much broader platform for
poets than there was say ten years
ago. You couldn't find a place to
read poetry ten years ago.

“There is a need among young
people today for a deﬁnite value
system, something they can
depend on. This could be because
they no longer feel that they can
depend on government.

“I think we all feel threatened by
some kind of aggression. There is
a lack of order. Poet’s and poetry
present a kind of order, a way of
arranging values. I think that's one
reason why poetry is more popular
now." ‘ .

In some ways Zimmer looks out

Skaters Make 

The Pitt Hockey Club received

1 some bad news as in preparation

..for their season debut at the Civic
Arena Sunday night against
Indiana. The Executive Board of
"the Western Pa. Intercollegiate

_ Hockey Association handed down

some rulings Wednesday night that
won’t affect Pitt for the Indiana
game but will juggle the roster a bit
for the next ﬁve games after.

As voted ﬁve to one by the
Executive Board, Pitt defenseman
Duke Shaeffer has been suspended

' for ﬁve games as a result of an

incident he was involved in during
a bench-emptying brawl in the
Pitt-Penn State (McKeesport)
game of November 6.

V In that incident, Shaeffer left the
bench to take part in the ﬁght and
knocked a PSU skater cold.
Charges that Shaeffer continually
punched his opponent even though
he was unconscious and lying flat
on the ice brought about the
severity of the ruling.

The Pitt defenseman was origin-
ally put on “waming” by WPIHA
commissioner Bob McCurdy, a
warning that stated no further
actions would be taken unless
Shaeffer was involved in another
“assault.” Under that original
ruling, Shaeffer’s playing status
was not altered in any way.

But that ruling was waived after
the Executive Board considered

-another incident that occured in a
game between Penn State (Mc-
Keesport) and Indiana. In that
contest, Doug Arnold of Indiana
intentionally struck an opponent
with his stick, sending him to the
hospital. The Board voted for his
suspension as well as Shaeffer's in
an effort to curb the outbreaks of
violence that have marked the
young season. 0

Also resolvedvat the meeting was
the appeal ﬁled by Pitt Hockey
Club president Bart" Mack re-
garding the ﬁnes placed on each of
the Pitt skaters that left the benjch
to participate in that brawl with
PSU (McKeesport). The ﬁne of $10
per man for both sides has been

 - Arena Debut

waived by vote of the board.

As a result of the numerous
brawls and outright attacks, the
Board moved to adopt some new
rules in regard to fighting. The
following rules will be in effect for
the hockey doubleheader at the
Arena Sunday:

Any player leaving his bench to
participate in a ﬁght will receive a
suspension for one calender year.

A ﬁve minute major assessed for
ﬁghting will now carry with it a
game misconduct and any ﬁve

‘minute ﬁghting penalty assessed in

the third period of any game will
carry a suspension of one game
with it.

Any attempt to deliberately
injure a player will result in a ﬁve
minute major penalty and a game
misconduct.

Any actual intentional injury to
another player will call for a 10
minute misconduct, a game mis-
conduct and a ﬁve game suspen-
sion.

Shaeffer’s~five game suspension
will not take effect until he receives
official notice from the WPIHA
office and he will be eligible for
Sunday's game, as will Doug
Arnold of Indiana.

“Duke wanted us to appeal the
warning at the meeting,” Mack
said, “but we had made no formal
appeal to the league prior to
Wednesday night. The Executive
Board‘ thought that we had
accepted the warning and admitted
that Duke was guilty of all the
charges. We will appeal in writing
to the commissioner.”

Pitt will meet Indiana at 9:00
p.m. in the second half of the
season's ﬁrst of nine hockey double
headers, all to be played at the

, Civic Arena. In the ﬁrst game at

7:00 p.m., Duquesne will make the
ﬁrst league appearance against
Carnegie-Mellon. Tickets, which
include admission for both games,
are available from team members,
at the Student Union ticket ofﬁce or
can be purchased at the Arena b_ox
ofﬁce.

It really couldn't be called’ a
‘game’ but the 1973-74 version of
the Pitt basketball team performed
in an intrasquad scrimmage Wed-
nesday night before just over 1,000
spectators at Fitzgerald Field-
house. A

The contest featured the Blue
against the Gold squad, the Blue
being formed by the starting lineup
that will face West Virginia in the
season opener tomorrow night at
,the WVU Colliseum. As expected,
the Blue squad romped to 119-75
victory over the reserves.

Head coach Buzz Ridl will have a
team of veterans to throw out

against the Mountaineers in his

ﬁrst attempt at improving last
year’s disappointing 12-14 record.
There will not be a freshman taking
an immediate step into a varsity
starting role, at least in the early
going of the campaign.

Senior Billy Knight, Pitt’s
All-"American candidate, will again
head the lineup. Considered to be
the best player in Pitt’s history,
Knight has lead the team for the
past two years in scoring,
rebounding, shooting percentage,
assists and steals. Knight played

only 10 minutes in each half of the
Blue-Gold game and ' scored 21

points while pulling down 11
rebounds. ‘ t

performers. Martin dumped in 19
points against his teammates
Wednesday night.

The only spot that Ridl has had a
loss of manpower is the center
position and he will ' go to
Morgantown with junior Jim Bolla
as the number one man. Out for
the season is 6-10 senior Lucious
Keese, who underwent a preseason
operation and will undoubtedly be
redshirted.

Actually, Bolla should be in his

that dates back to his sophomore
season. Bolla, 6-8 and 215 pounds,

Tracksters Look
  For Good Year

BY JOSEPH BATHANTI

As Coach Jim Banner put it, the
upcoming track season for Pitt,
looks very good. How good Pitt is
will be found out onvJanuary 11
when the Bannermen will travel to
the University of Maryland for the
CYO meet. V

This year’s team as in the past is
built around a nucleus of excellent
depth in t the middle distance
events. Handling most of the
running in these events will be Rich
Jackson, Chuck Mozingo, Tom
Moore, and Jack Patrick, all
returning from last season.
Jackson and Mozingo both run as
extremely good quarter mile while
Moore and Patrick are equally
capable in the half mile. Coach
Smitty Brown tentatively states
these four, runners as this year’s
two mile. relay team. Last year they
put together the fourth best
outdoor time in the country.

In the jumping event-s, Pitt is
expected to give no ground. Billy
Rea, the two time All‘-American
long-jumper moves into his senior
year and hopefully another record
breaking season. “He speaks for
himself," said Coach Brown of
Rea, who placed fourth in the
Olympic trials and had the seventh
best long jump in the world last
year. His best jump to date is 26

feet 7 1/2 inches. Along with being .

a tremendous threat in the long
jump, he is ‘an excellent triple
jumper, with a mark of 50 feet, 10
inches. In the triple jump, Rea is
ably backed up by Roosevelt
Randall, who has jumped 49 feet, 9
inches. _

Pitt is also very strong in the high
jump with Tim Riley and George
Jupin, who have both jumped a

tremendous 6 feet, 10 inches.

Things that Coach Banner and his
team will try to improve will be the
ﬁeld events. They lack depth in
this area, particularly the pole vault
and the shot put. Coaches Banner
and Brown, however, feel that the
strengths of the team will more
than compensate for the weak-
nesses. _

Newcomers that are expected to
help the team are freshman Don
Betterley, a state champion quarter
miler, Jay Sharpley, a state
champion, hurdeld, Terry Wile, a
state champion two miler, and
Wayne Cooley an excellent half
miler.

Another newcomer expected to
help the Pitt trackman is Coach
Fred De Groot, an extremely
competent individual who will be
coaching the hurdlers and dis-
tancemen on a part time basis.
Said Coach Banner of De Groot,
“I’m really pleased to have him.
He should be a great asset.”

When asked to ‘comment on the
Nationals, Coach Banner diploma-
tically remarked, “You don’t
project for the Nationals. There are
so many great track athletes
around the country. If any of our
kids places or wins he’s a super
athlete. Our two mile relay team
should be a top contender.”

The Pitt track team this year
should be a top contender. The
coaches are optimistic and so are
the athletes. The track team will
informally kick off the year at the
ﬁeld house, Tuesday at 4:30 in the
ﬁeld house, in an intra-squad meet.
It's open to the public and should
provide a great afternoon of
competition.

tained it ever since.

In all, there will be 10 lettermen
returning for‘Ridl which will give
the. team depth and experience.

Besides the ﬁve starters, sopho- »

more Keith Starr, senior Sam
Fleming and Wagoner will be on
hand. Redshirted Keese and guard
Marvin Abrams, whose playing
status has not yet been clearly
designated, are the only losses the
team has suffered through injuries.

Ridl was most impressed by 6-6
frosh forward Wayne Talbot, who
pumped in 12 points against the
starters and pulled down eight
rebounds. Talbot could put some
pressure on the starters for a spot
in the lineup.

“Talbot causes trouble under the
boards,” Ridl remarked. “He’s
real strong--205 pounds and was
aggressive against the Blue
squad.”

Fleming took top honors in
scoring Wednesday night with 24
points playing for the Blue. Willie
Kelly, a 6-6‘ sophomore, had 11
rebounds and 16 points for the Gold
in a losing cause.

’West Virginia . coach Sonny
Moran has not settled on a starting
lineup for the regular season
opener but all ﬁve from last year’s
starting crew have returned for the
Mounties.

“I think that sometimes the
starting role has been over-
emphasized in basketball today,"
Moran said. _“During the course of
the season, the top seven or eight
players will all have equal playing
time. We may adjust our starters
to match the opponents.

Returning from last year’s 10-I5
Mountie team are 6-7 soph Warren
Baker, the leading scorer and
rebounder as a freshman; 6-6

I junior forward Jerome Anderson,

with a 12.1 average; 6-8 junior
center
forward Scott MacDonald and floor
leader 6-0 sophomore guard Dave
McCar.dle.

“We do not have the big man to
dominate the game offensively or
defensively,” Moran noted, “but
our speed will be better this year
and we will be able to do~more
pressing and play more of a
running game.”

Pitt opens its schedule with four
games .on the road, including the
Steel Bowl at the Civic Arena on
December 7.

Winners Advance In IM Playoffs

BY RICK ST OUFFER
The Winners, undefeated in
season play, showed an explosive
offense Tuesday as they defeated
the Unknowns 26-8 to advance in’

the intramural playoffs.

The Winners received to open
the game but the offense couldn’t
get moving and on fourth and long
yardage they punted.

The offense couldn't move for

ﬂthe Winners but the defense made

up for them. Setting up on his own,
quarterback Jury. for the
Unknowns, tried to set up but was
rushed hard by Grant and lost 10
yards. On the very next play Jury
rolled to his right and threw but
Jeannett intercepted running un-
touched into the endzone for the

touchdown. The point attempt was
wide right and the Winners led 6-0.

The Unknowns, showing poise,
came right back. Jury hit Gretch
for a first down near the 50 yard
line. On the next play Jury snuck
picking up five yards.

' With second and 0 five, Jury
tossed to Morgan for the first
down. Reading the defense, Jury
called another sneak sprinting to
his right evading the defense for
the tieing score. The two point kick
was good and the Unknowns held
an 8-6 lead.

Taking over, the Winners’
Blystone used the sneak to his
advantage picking up a first down.
On first and ten, Blystone called a
“bomb” but Jeannett couldn't get

I under it,

the pass falling in-
complete. Jury put on a strong
rush catching Blystone for a big
loss and on fourth down the
Winners punted.

The punt was a dandy, going out
of bounds on the one foot line. Jury
couldn’t put anything together a
drive including a fourth down
gamble on a sneak giving the
Winners excellent field position.

Time was running out in the half
as Blystone hit Jeannett perfectly
in the endzone with the Winners
going ahead to stay 12-8 to end the
half. .

The Unknowns took the second
half kickoff and started to move.
Jury used the sneak picking up
eight yards before being pushed

out of bounds. On second and two,
Jui'y hit Gretch for five yards and
the first down. But the Winners
shut the door stopping the
Unknowns. On a fourth and two,
the Unknowns gambled but the
pass was incomplete with the
Winners taking over again with
good field position. ‘ Blystone
gained some hard yards onga sneak
and then on second and four hehit
Sincieri for the touchdown in-
creasing their lead to 10.

' With time running out the
Unknowns began to force their
passes to try to catch up. Blystone
picked off one of these errant
passes giving the Winners the ball
on their own 30. Blystone needed
only two passes, one to Happe for a

first down and the other to Neigoot
who made a leaping catch for the
Winners to have their fourth
touchdown. The extra point kick
was good and the Winners led 26-8.

twice and once to Gretch and

ing. the registrations of all
students in the College of

School of General Studies,
who do not have their state-
ments validated by the due
dates indicated, will be can-
celled. This procedure has
been in operation for the
School of General Studies for
one year and has proven ef-

fective in making courses
I available for attending stud-
ents during the Drop,Add

'2. The $15.00 retroactive tuition

increase for the Fall term

caused the message

This is not the case. These
students have until December

tive charge.

AFinal Note:

As with any significant change
in the way things are done. we.
anticipate some problems. The
Schedule Card and the State-
ment‘. Validation Certificate will
enable the student to notice any
discrepancies which may occur.
The students assistance is soli-
cited in reporting promptly any

BY YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt swimmers will be
traveling to State College this
weekend to competein the annual
Penn State Relays, and a much
improved Pitt team will try to do
better than _last year's ﬁfth place
ﬁnish.

“This is almost a small national
championship meet," said Coach
Bradshaw “and it gives the team a
chance to show what they can really
do.” With the great improvement
of all the teams competing in the
meet, the Panthers have a good
chance to prove that they are
indeed a fine team.

The tankers will want to do well
in the 2000-yard free style relay,

paced by Jerry Demuro. John
Scheppner. Walt Young, and
Carlos Santiago who have all

broken the l0O0—yard record for the
Pitt squad. With three back-
strokcrs who are better than what
he had last year, Bradshaw also
expects a good showing in the
400—yard backstroke relay.

Competing in the relay will be
the Wallace brothers, Mark and
Eric, Larry Rosa, and Carlos
Santiago. Mark Wallace just
missed being an All-American
backstroker in his freshman year
last season.

There will be a lot of freshmen‘ in

this meet. but Bradshaw does not_

feel that the fact that they are ﬁrst
year men will affect their per-
formances. “The only thing I can
foresee is a couple of false starts,”
said the swim mentor, “but that’s
about it."

The divers will also have a

chance to show what they can do.
Coach Coffey has slated Jack
Garrow and Jeff Miller on the
three-meter boards. Garrow has
come off a fantastic showing at the
national AAU meet where he took
third place in the three-meter
event.

On the one-meter boards Coffey
has Jeff Miller, who took a sixth
place in the one-meter event at the
AAU meet at Clarion. Also diving
in the event is Tom Faytol, who
Coffey has said many times is
Olympic material. He will have
Faytol stick to the one-meter board,
until the coach feels that he is
ready to compete in both.

“One thing we have more of this
year which might show un in the

meet in depth," said Bradshaw.
“We don’t have maximum depth
but it is the most we have had in
many years."

That depth will provide some
surprises for the teams competing
in the meet. New Pitt swimmers
such as Carlos Santiago and Jerry
Demuro should give the ‘Panthers
some extra added punch.

Satiago will be swimming in the
400-yard butterfly along with Dave
Natali, Ron Bokulic, and another
new Pitt aquisition, Larry Rosa.
Rosa has shown great potential in
practice meets and Dave Natali was
good enough to make it to the
Easterns last year.

The medley relays were the

swimmers best events last year.

setting a new team record. The
medleys in the Penn State relays
will be quite formidable with Mark
Wallace. John Templin, Dave
Natali, and John Scheppner in the
200-yard medley and in the
400-yard event.

The divers will have to face some
great competition from schools like
East Carolina, Monmouth, Temple,
and Bucknell. The Monmouth
team is bringing the small college
national champion of last year
while East Carolina will ' have
another tough diver by the name of
Jack Marrow. Tony Camille of
Temple and Steve Richards of
Bucknell. two rivals of the Panther
divers will be on hand to try and
dethrone the Cats.

The Pitt divers captured first
place in the three-meter event last
year and will try to repeat that feat
again this year. Coach Coffey will
be happy if the team just makes the
finals.

“If we make it to the ﬁnals we
will be in the top six," said Coffey
“and that would make us all very
happy." Coffey said something to
that effect before the AAU meet
before the divers picked up third
place.

Bradshaw would not make any
predictions about the meet.

“We just want to ﬁnish in the top
eight in each event." That is a tall
order to ﬁll. but the Cats just might
do it and put on a very impressive
show for the rest of the East.

  How GM is responding
to the energy problem.

Over a year ago, we asked our
plant engineers to establish an energy
conservation program to cut waste,
improve utilization and generally
increase the effective use of our
energy resources.

In our plants we’re instituting
programs to salvage oil and other

combustible materials that were

once thought to be waste materials
of the manufacturing process. Then
we’re using those former waste mate-

rials to fire boilers in some plants and ,

in others we’re cleaning the oil and
selling it to local power generating
stations. It’s a method that has been
tried and tested. It works. It’s even
economical.

A system developed by General
Motors engineers for “scrubbing” the

  sulfur dioxide out of coal smoke is

moving at an accelerated pace. As
the technology is proved out, we’re
making it available to anyone who
can use it. There are large deposits
of coal in the United States that will
become immediate substitutes for oil
when we can make sulfur-bearing
coal an environmentally acceptable
fuel.

We are working toward improv-
ing the gas mileage in the cars we
design andbuild.Wind tunnel experi-
ments, weight reduction programs

and major programs for the develop-

ment of more efficient engines are
all being pushed ahead.

And we are preparing ourselves
to satisfy any increased future con-
sumer demand for smaller, more
energy-efﬁcient engines and cars.

Properly utilized, mass transpor-
tation systems are also highly efﬁ—
cient users of energy. GM is engaged
in major research and product devel-
opment programs to improve bus
transportation, the most ﬂexible,
easiest and quickest to implement of

mass transportation systems. Those

programsinclude the design ofbuses,

new methods for the efficient opera-

tionofbusesonreservedorexclusive
lanes into and through downtown
areas or central business districts,
and the automated control of rubber-

tired transit vehicles on special.

guideways. Long range plans for
mass transportation developed by
GM were displayed in Washington

, at Transpo 72.

In addition to building standard
rail commuter diesel electromotives,
we have initiated efforts to produce
locomotives powered only by elec-

‘tricity. ‘GM, over many years, has

done creative research which

‘has been utilized by_ government

agencies and transit operators in
improving public transit. As urban

‘ transportation systems are designed
. and approved by the various levels

of government, GM will be ready to
build thehardware.

Energy can also be conserved
by the more efficient use of the cars
and trucks now on the road. It is in
everyone’s interest to get maximum
gas mileage by maintaining cars and
trucks in good order, avoiding exces-
sive speeds and quick starts, and by
sharing the ride whenever conve-

  merit and practical. For instance, driv-

ing at 50 mph rather than at 70 mph
could increase gas mileage by about
20%. We are taking-steps to remind
our customers of these good driving
practices.

GM is determined to do its full
share in the resolution of the energy
problem.

We also pledge our complete
support for all reasonable govern-
ment efforts to increase available

energy and maintain maximum con- r

sumer choice.
