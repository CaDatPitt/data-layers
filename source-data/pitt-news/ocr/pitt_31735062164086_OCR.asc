Editor, The Pitt News:

I have been observing with
great interest and alarm the re-
cent developments concerning
increased facilities for handi-
capped students as reported in
this newspaper.

It is a weil-known fact that
there exist in this country sev-
eral institutions of higher learn-
ing with extensive special facili-
ties for‘ the handicapped.

These universities provide the
handicapped student with pa

- higher education, along with ex-

tensive help with his physical

problems and an atmosphere,

virtually free of physical bar-
riers of any kind.

Almost any student who,
wishes to or must attend them
may do so, especially since ex-
tensive ﬁnancial aid is avail-
able for this purpose through
the Bureau of Vocational Re-
habilitation, and admitting of-
ﬁces are favorable to the han-
dicapped so that any handi-
capped students who applies t0
several is almost certain to be
granted admission to at least
one.

The other choice open to the
handicapped student seeking a
college is to attend a school like
Pitt which has comparatively
few special’ facilities but with
existing conditions which are
manageable for the handicapped
student. Admittedly the latter
course of action is the more dif-
ficult, but I see several distinct
advantages in doing so.

First of all, it is my personal
feeling that an environment as
free of special facilities as pos-
sible is desirable for the han-

. dicapped student so that he can

learn how to cope with problems
he will meet in future working
or living situations.

The student who has the so-
lutions to his problems handed
to him may, in fact, forget that
the world is basically not built
for the physically handicapped
and this fact is something he
must have the ingenuity and
emotional and physical stam-
ina to face up to every day of

_his life. He will not ﬁnd side-
walks, doors, elevators, and
living quarters made to suit
his needs in working, shop-
ping, housing, and other nor-
mal situations after he leaves
college and the sooner he
learns what to do about it the
better off he will be.

4 On a less personal level, I am
afraid that-the great clamor for

_special facilities for the handi-

capped on this c a m p u s may

cause the University to adopt a
policy seriously limiting the
number and types of handi-
capped students it will admit.

For instance, if Miss Qarner
from Open Door for the Handi-
capped is to be taken seriously,
(Letter to the Editor, June 17)
at present the University should
not admit wheelchair students
because the non-ramped side-
-walks may cause them to fall
out of their wheelchairs!

No longer will any handi-
capped student who desires to
enter the University of Pitts-
burgh and take his chances as
to whether or not he can man-
age with existing situations be
allowed to do so. He will he
told “We have accepted our
capacity of handicapped
students,” or “We are not
equipped to handle your prob-
lems.” _ ' ~

It is unrealistic to think at
this point that the University
willbe financially or practically
able to equip itself to handle

a any situation with a handicapped
student that comes up. ,

I would consider equipping the
ﬁre doors on the Lily Court with
outside handles, along with
equipping any new buildings
with wheelrhair-accessible en-
trances, to be top-priority pro-
jects. Both these measures would
allow for greater personal in-
dependence without greatly dis-
torting the normal environment.

I am very deﬁnitely not in
favor of modiﬁed living quar-
ters because of the tendency
to remove the need for the
student to adjust to a normal
situation, and because a limit-
ed number of specially-
equipped ‘rooms would deﬁ-
nitely tend to'limit the num-
ber, of students accepted.’

Likewise, adding an elevator
stop on the second ﬂoor of the
Cathedral or launching into an
extensive curb—cutting project
would be an inconvenient, ex-
pensive move and would present
the handicapped student with
the unrealistic view that he need
not be limited by pre-existing
con'ditions in the future situa-
tions he will meet.

Finally, if this University and
others like it do follow in the
footsteps of the University of
Illinois there. will only be two
kinds of institutions of higher
‘learning as far as the handi-
capped student is concerned:
those where existing conditions

make admission impossible and.

those equipped fully with special

*,facilities to. suit his needs.

I would like to say that I
am very grateful for anything
the University has done to
help me cope with-existing
conditions on this ‘campus (i.e.,

Shows Need for Depth

By FRANK SMIZIK

If ever a team was better
than their record indicates
the 1964 Panther track team-
was such a squad. Only in the
Navy and Penn State meets were
the trackmen outclassed and real-
ly beaten. ‘ .

In the defeats to Ohio Univer-
sity and West Virginia the losses
were the direct result of injur-
ies. Bill DelVecchio pulled a ham-
string in the middle of the race
and the loss of that race was the
difference. In the West Virginia
meet, if Joe Friend hadn’t broken
his leg in the broad jump, and
had been able to compete in the
hurdles, the score would have been
in Pitt’s favor.

The entire problem isn’t injur-
ies however. A track team can’t,
be good unless it has depth, and

when there are only 15 or 16 men‘

to vie for three places in 14 events
then some men are going to get
pretty tired. —

Next year will be the same for
the track team. There are some
ﬁne individual performers, but no-
body to back them up to take
seconds and thirds. This year

there wasn’t even a regular pole.

vaulter or high jumper who could
do better than sub—par perform-
ances, andiin almost every meet
they lost both first and second in
these events which meant valu-
able points.

The" sprints should be the
strong point of the Panthers next
season, with DelVecchio. and Dick

~ of her performance: Miss Mar-

riott’s presentation preserved
the sense of the play. Her in-
tellectual restraint was as im-
pressive as her elocution.

Miss Marriott also portrayed’

' other characters, such as Romeo,

complete with Roman toga and
sandals. According to Dean Wads-

Adams Talks

On Undergrads
I At Coffee Hour

“Whither the Undergraduate?”
will be discussed at the SUB
Forum Coffee Hour by Dr. Ber-
nard S. Adams, special assistant
to the Chancellor this afternoon
at 3 in the SU Lower Loungs.

The topic is “purposely cryp-
tic,” according to Dr. Adams, be-

cause he wants the Coffee Hour

to be an informal discussion rather
than a rigid lecture. Three gen-
eral areas which Dr. Adams will
discuss. are 1) the changing role
of the undergraduate today, 2)
changes which should be consid-
ered in undergraduate education,
and 3) what he sees happening to

undergraduate education every-
A where.

Dr. Adams, who is leaving the
University to serve as Dean of
Students at Oberlin College, hopes

_ to emphasize good relationships .
between students and teachers in-

side and outside the classroom in
his new position.

Dr. Adams came to the Univer-
sity in 1957, and has held posi-
tions as Director of Admissions
and Student Aid. Last March Dr.
Adams received his Ph.D. in En-
glish. ‘ '

worth, after seeing her "picture,
one would be more surprised had
she portrayed Juliet rather "than
Romeo. She played down her
womanliness, cut her hair short
and was heavily built. . '
Emma_ Waller Aeted Male R’oles
Another actress of male roles
was Emma Waller. In 1858 she
came to the U.S. from Great
Britain. She was best known here
for her role as Iago in Othello.

 

 

Newspaper reviews, quoted by
Dean Wadsworth, described her as
heavy and bold, with a strong,
fﬂexible. voice. Even more than
Miss Marriott she conveyed the

' illusion of masculinity.

Both Miss Marriott and Mrs.
Waller, according to Dean.
Wadsworth, h a d concern for
dramatic meaning and clear de-
livery. Differences between Miss
Marriott and Mrs. Waller were
in method and not in concep-
tion of the male roles‘. Mrs.
Waller made a concerted at-
tempt at masculinity possibly
because of the very manly role
of Iago._ . 

Both were serious ‘actresses and
earned their living at this pro-
fession; they never used any
.shoddy- stage tricks in their per-
formances. These women were an
I interesting phenomenon in theatri-
cal history and are an- enlighten-
ing comment on the Victorian age.
