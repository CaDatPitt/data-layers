Posvar denies
moratorium;

refuses to take
stance on war

By Renee Crespy
Staff Writer

Pitt President Wesley Posvar has rejected
a request for a moratorium on all classes,

 but he has asked professors to excuse

students who want to participate in
educational programs on the Persian Gulf
war.

In a letter to the Faculty and Staff for
Peace in the Middle East, the group that
requested the moratorium, Posvar said
that it would be inappropriate for the
university to schedule a moratorium on all
classes since many students feel that they
have the right to attend scheduled classes.

However, Posvar added that students
who wish to participate in educational
programs held on campus should be
allowed to go without being penalized for
being absent.

“lf alternative educational programs on
this war are held now on campus, I ask
[that] faculty and those of their students
who wish to participate should be allowed
to [be] absent themselves from classes on
a given day without prejudice or penalty,
and when feasible, with opportunities to
perform makeup study,” Posvar said.

Posvar also responded to FSfP’s request
that Pitt take a stance on the war.

The Persian Gulf is a matter of urgent
concern to all; however, it would be

inappropriate for the university to publicly

Casey's FY92
budget plan
‘disappointing’
to university

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

Pitt’s administration, still reeling from
Gov. Robert Casey’s $6.2 million cut in this
year’s budget, was dealt a second fiscal
blow last week when Casey announced
his recommendations for Pitt’s fiscal year
1992 appropriation.

Casey’s plan would give the university
$118.6 million in funding, 5.5 percent less
than Pitt requested.

In a statement, Pitt President Wesley
Posvar said, “We sympathize with the
governor’s need to propose a balanced
budget and appreciate his support for
public education. However, the governor’s
proposed zero—increase budget for [fiscal
year] ‘92, coming after [the first cut]  is
very disappointing.”

Under Casey’s proposal, Pitt would be
receiving $3.1 million in added funding for
the educational and general budget;
however, Pitt was to have gotten this
amount for this year’s tuition-challenge
grant program that Casey cut from last
month.

Among the modifications made by Casey:

-Pitt’s Bradford campus will receive
$395,000 less than requested.

~Ethnic heritage studies will receive a
$50,000 increase in funding.

-Pitt’s Center for Hazardous Materials
Research was denied funding for the second

Sonia Sanchez was a stutterer
when she attended school in New
York City as a child.

Asking the teacher a question
about math was often interrupted
by the extended sounds of
vowels, repetition of consonants
and laughter from the “bad"
students who sat in the back of
the classroom.

“BBBBuutt, hhhhoow do you
fffacttor that eqqquation. IIII don’t

ddddone,” Sanchez stuttered
purposely while reading her
poem entitled “Norma” during a
poetry reading in celebration of
Black History Month 1991.

“I was a stutterer, you know;
when I raised my hand to say
something, all the people
collapsed and said, ‘Oh, God,
Sonia’s gonna say something,”’
said Sanchez to her audience of
guests and students at the
University of Pittsburgh.

“And so I raised my hand

couldn’t teach math —— you know,
those teachers in school who get
paid to teach math and can’t,”
Sanchez said.

Sanchez explained that one of
the students in the class was the
inspiration for her poem.

“Anyway, there was a student
in my class by the name of Norma
who was a mathematical genius
and who was also a linguist,” said
Sanchez.

“But when I met Norma some
years later when I had got out of

NYU. She walked toward me
with [drug] tracks on her arms
and legs, and she had four little
children. I started to cry,” Sanchez
said.

After reading her poem at the
event, which was sponsored by
the Black Action Society in the
Frick Fine Arts Building on Friday
evening, Sanchez said that it was
important that society stop
producing Normas and make sure
that young children do not use
drugs.

feelings on the war in the Persian

Theater group complains to SGB about trash in Cathedral

By Tammy Stradley
Staff Writer

Trash in the basement of the Cathedral
of Learning is interfering with the work of
Pitt theater students, the Undergraduate
Theater Committee told the Student
Government Board at an SGB meeting on
Wednesday.

“Roy Rogers and Central Printing must
be more aware and more responsible for
their garbage," saidjerome Indovina, UTC
president. Indovina stressed that he was
not necessarily speaking on behalf of the

committee but for the students and faculty
that use the classrooms.

Most of the classrooms in the basement
of the cathedral are theater-arts classes.
Performances are also held for the general
public in the basement.

V “People said how wonderful it was to
come see the show, but how terrible the
conditions were in the basement,” said
Jennifer Malosh, UTC literary manager.

SGB President Brent Saunders said the
board would look into the problem.

Some employees of Central Printing do
not believe there is a problem.

“When we come down, there isn't junk
laying around in the hallways,” said Jeff
Sudomerski, University Business Services
staff specialist. “I don’t know what they’re
talking about!“

Debbie Smith, general manager at Roy
Rogers, said she was also unaware of any
trash problems in the basement. “The only
time that there would be garbage left
down there would be if the compactor
[located in the basement of the cathedral
of Learning] was broken. If that’s broken,”
she said, “we do leave our dumpster down
there along with everyone else in the

university."

If the UTC had a problem with the trash,
it should have informed Roy Rogers before
going to the SGB, Smith said.

Roy Rogers and Central Printing were
unaware of the allegations made by the
UTC at the SGB meeting.

In other business the‘“SGB~-will make a
statement this week concerning the
possibility of Pitt faculty unionizing.
Saunders researched the effects a union
would have on students and has met with

Local teachers receive honors for helping minorities

By Donna Terrell
Staff Writer

People who educate African
Americans get ﬁred, while those
who do not get promoted,
according to black studies

S Professor Barbara Sizemore.

Sizemore said she made this
observation through years as an

. educator and an administrator.

Sizemore spoke at an awards
ceremony on Friday held by the

Black Student Affiliate of the
Council of Graduate Students in
Education. The ceremony
honored local teachers and
principals whose coordinated
efforts have produced higher test
scores in predominantly black
schools.

The honorees were all
participants in The School
Improvement Program, which
was designed to improve
instruction for students who

attend schools with low test
scores.

Awards were given to people
who are helping to “close the
gap” by developing and
implementing programs that will
help minorities in Pittsburgh
schools reach and surpass the
national norm on achievement
tests.

Shirley A. Biggs of the School
of Education said SIP has helped
demonstrate that “African-

Americans can and do learn
consistently.” She ‘credited
Sizemore’s work and research for
making the achievements in
Pittsburgh schools visible locally
and nationally.

“The future of society is related
to achievement, especially on the
part of minorities,” said Pitt
Provost Donald Henderson.

CCS identifies ‘academic entrepreneurs’

college campuses across the

country to identify what Kulnik
calls “academic entrepreneurs"
— those who want to take charge
of their education and be a part
of creative global problem-
solving.

Kulnik, along with Pitt’s CCS
contact, Dennis Brutus,
conducted a seminar in the
William Pitt Union Friday. It
consisted of a day—long series of
lectures, presentations and
discussions comparing the

' changes in South Africa to changes

in Pittsburgh.

The center is set up “to provide
a resource for interested
students,” Kulnik said.

Brutus, a South African exile
and chairperson of Pitt’s black
studies department, hoped to
encourage students to initiate
independent-study projects on
issues confronting South Africa
and how these issues will affect
local communities in western
Pennsylvania and Ohio now and
in the future.

Kulnik said he fears college

students may not be prepared to
be democratic participants in the
global age. There is and will
continue to be, according to
Kulnik, an urgent need for creative
military, political and economic
policies. He said introducing
students and faculty to world
cultures is the only way to produce
a new generation of effective
leadership.

Pittsburgh serves as locale for The Silence

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

(Editor's Note: This is the first in
a four-part series about the
making of The Silence of the
Lambs. The fourth segment will
run in this weele’s issue of
Showcase.)

The Keystone Commons,
located in east Pittsburgh off Exit
10 of the parkway, is an
impressive reminder of
Pittsburgh’s glory days —- when
men were men, and industry
meant getting your hands and
face dirty. Stretching for over
500,000 square feet, the hulking
complex of blackened steel and
brick has a humbling effect; if
you were to diein the God-
forsaken place, it might be a few‘
years before anyone found you.

Once you’re inside, though, it’s
more than a little frightening, in
part because shadows lurk behind
every corner of the super-
structure’s back alleys, and also
because this once-industrious
plant housed over 20,000 Wes-
tinghouse workers and not a
single soul is left. Most of all, the

Keystone Commons is frightening A

because this ghost factory of a
bygone era houses one other
scary feature. For the past three
months a serial killer has been
haunting the grounds.

And right now, he’s sitting next
to me in the taxicab that pulls us

into the main driveway of the A

Commons. After we get out of the

V car (and afterl pay the cab driver),

this mass murderer and I enter
the elevator to the building which
will lead us to his terrible house
of horrors.

Inside the enormous lift, which

was used several weeks ago to 1'

transport a vintage 1930 Packard,
Gina White, a production
assistant, informsthis “killer”
(actor Ted Levine, Betrayed) that

- upstairs on the set of Jonathan

Demme’s latest film venture, The
Silence of the Lambs.

Based on the Thomas Harris
best-seller, the movie stars Oscar-
winner Jodie Foster as an FBI
trainee tracking down a vicious
serial killer; the leathery Scott
Glenn (Silverado, TheRightStufﬁ
The Hunt forRed October) as her
superior special agent; veteran
Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins as
a psychopathic psychiatrist
assisting her in the manhunt; and
Levine as Jamie Gumb, the serial
murderer whom the trainee seeks.

As we ride up, Levine suddenly
starts kicking the mammoth
elevator in his stylish cowboy
boots, shouting obscenities at the
top of his lungs. The,PA. and I
turn to each other with widened
eyes; maybe the casting was a
little too perfect for this movie. As
the lift continues, I wonder if
Harris would be pleased with the
casting director’s choice. Both of
us were certainly convinced.

warehouse, which is the size of
an airplane hangar, we arrive at
the foreboding set. On our left is
the Packard, neatly covered,
awaiting its spectacular scene by
the craft service table. Straight
ahead, though, is the SET; an
enormous wall rises, obliterating
any view of the bustling activity
we faintly hear beyond it.

At this point, Levine is not a
very happy guy. In fact, he’s
already shouting at one of the
assistant directors. Apparently, he
missed his ride this morning to
the Commons, where the
premises have been converted
into an incredible series of sound
stages. Forced to take a cab (with
me, no less), he has now delayed
the shooting ,of this morning’s
scenes by about two hours. Now
everyone is waiting on him to
begin the day’s shooting. At this
point, he looks like he could kill
someone for real.

Pitt students can trade bodily ﬂuids for cash

By Andrew Bruno
For T be Pitt News

Pitt students can earn extra
money at area hospitals and
research facilities by donating
their time, efforts, and in some
cases, bodily ﬂuids.

Sera—Tec Biologicals, located
at 5407 Forbes Ave. in Oakland,
pays money to anyone wishing
to donate plasma. Upon the first
visit to Sera-Tec, potential plasma
donors will be given a physical
by an in—house doctor. The
physical takes 15 to 20 minutes,
at which time the“donor’s blood
pressure and iron and protein

levels are checked and a drug
screen is given.

Emily Johnson, an employee
of Sera-Tec, stressed that overall
physical fitness inﬂuences an
individual’s acceptance into the
program. If everything checks
out, donations can be given twice
within a seven-day period.
Donors make $10 on their first
visit and $15 on each subsequent
visit.

Every time a donation is made,
technicians check iron and protein
levels to make sure that they are
within appropriate parameters. A
donation takes about 40 minutes
on an automated machine.

Magee~\X/omens Hospital runs
a lucrative program for interested,
healthy males.

The obstetrics and gynecology
department is involved in a donor-
insemination program or “sperm
bank.”

To become a donor, male
students must first contact the
hospital to schedule an
appointment. At the appointment,
a blood test is given and a sperm
sample is taken.

Veronica Mcvicker, registered
nurse coordinator, said that
approximately 50 percent of men
do not meet the criteria to become
a donor. Sperm samples must

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Monday, February 11, 1991

first be frozen and then thawed-

A certain percentage of sperm
must survive for the man I0

I become a regular donor.

For the first two tests a
perspective donor is paid $25. If
accepted, a regular donor can
give sperm every one to two
weeks and receive $50 Cach Visit-

McVicker cautioned that this
involves a serious commitment
on the part of the donor because
it is important to evaluate the
specimens on an ongoing basis.
The administration also assures
strict confidentiality with their
donors.

Dave Williams from the

 

Behavioral Medical Anxiety
Program at the Learning Research
and Development Center is
involved with a study which pays
$250 over a period of four visits.

The study is based on

. ambulatory blood pressure and

heart rate. Each subject is
monitored for a 24-hour period
on four separate occasions.

The project coordinator is Lisa
T amres, and more information is
available at the Learning Research
and Development Center.

There are also several studies
held by individual researchers
throughout the school year which

The theme of Pitt Professor
Emeritus Robert P. 'Newman’s
book reads a little bit like a twisted
fairy tale. ‘Boy meets girl. Boy
falls in love with girl. Girl is
accused of being a Communist.
Boy is ﬁred and blackballed.

These events occurred during
the McCarthy Era of the 19505.
Newman’s book, The Cold War
Romance of Lillian Hellman and
john Melby, focuses on two
victims of this radical period in
American government.

Newman first met John Melby
in 1976 and was intrigued by his
story.

Melby was a. bright young
conservative foreign—service
official with a squeaky-clean
record; he was fired because of
his romance with American
playwright; Lillian Hellman.

“Melby’s ft-ring by Secretary of

lrt/oy Er‘

was probably the most prominent
instance of guilt by association in

getting a good employee ﬁred.

Melby was fired because of his
affair with Hellman and because,
in seven different loyalty security
hearings, he refused to repudiate
her or accuse her of Communism, ”
Newman Said. ”

The irony is that Lillian Hellman
wasn't even a Communist,
Newman said.

“She was involved in left-wing
organizations and knew
Communists, but she was
definitely not a Communist,” he

‘ said.

After Melby was fired, he
attempted to fight the decision
privately but lost. Newman said
Melby’s life was ruined.

“He..,was out of work for about

two years and eventually was
hiredat a university,” Newman
said.

you off to war again. In your
time, you are not supposed to
have wars because we came up
against the Vietnam War, and we
talked about it. Now we got the
man named Bush who’s sending
you off to war, and he’s going to
war because he didn’t intend to
negotiate,” she said.

As a professor at Temple
University and an internationally
known lecturer on black culture,
literature and women’s liberation,
Sanchez took the opportunity
between poetry readings to
express her opinion on many of
the societal controversies that face
America today.

One of her issues was how
women are portrayed on
television.

“Isn’t it strange that the black
woman and the white woman on
MTV has become nothing but a
sexual object again?” said Sanchez

as she stepped up to the front of ‘

the stage from behind the podium
and began to move her hips left
and right, back and forth.

“Why should women have to
get off on each other foraman to
get a hard—on," Sanchez asked
her audience.

Because of Sanchez’s tight
schedule and desire to just go
home and jump into bed, having
been on the road for four days,
the order of speakers was
changed, and Sanchez was
moved to the beginning of the
program.

Marta Ellinger, a junior at the
University of Pittsburgh who is
majoring in black studies and
English writing, preceded
Sanchez in the poetry recital.
Effinger is also the deputy
chairperson of the BAS.

Other poets were Valerie J.
Williarns—Lawrence, playwright,
actress, publisher and founder
and director of Ebony Players of
Louisville, Ky.; Dennis Brutus,
chairperson of the Department
of Black Community Education
Research and Development at
Pitt; and Rob Penny, playwright
and founder of the Kuntu Writers
Workshop.

PPC holds
student art
exhibition

By Andrea Guilfoy
For T be Pitt News

The criterion for the contest
was to “create a beautiful
thing,” and that’s exactly what
72 Pitt students did.

This evening is opening
night for the Pitt Program
Council’s first student art
exhibit and competition.

The artwork will be
displayed at the Conney M.
Kimbo Art Gallery in the
William Pitt Union. The
winner will be announced at
the reception tonight in the
gallery.

Scott Connelly, a student
at Pitt who is not an art

major, submitted his six-piece i

acrylic painting of a lightning
bolt hitting a tree. Connelly
said he does a lot of his art
work in his spare time and
just wanted to get his piece
displayed.

David Deluliis, another
competitor, entered a wax-
resist piece depicting two
boats approaching a finish
line. He is not an art major,
but he said that he always
wanted to be one. The
competition will give him a
chance to have his artwork
noticed, he said.

“We had a great response,
and I'm really excited about
the competition, ” said Nicole
Vitale, art director of the Pitt
Program Council. “I only
expected ,about 25 to 30
entries, but we ended up
with 72.”

Two judges selected on a
recommendation from the
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
will peruse the various
sculptures, photographs,
drawings and paintings
before the exhibit opens.

A winner will be selected
in each of the six categories:
photography, sculpture,
watercolor, chalk and pastel,
acrylic and pen and pencil.
The judges will then choose
three overall winners and
award them $150 each.

Suzanne Slavick, a painting
professor at Carnegie Mellon,
will judge the exhibit. She
said she’ll be looking for
originality and technical
expertise. “I’d like to see
something that makes me
reconsider reality in some
way,” she said.

Ron Desmett, the other
judge, has been a sculptor
for 20 years. He said he’ll be
looking for a combination of
quality and construction. “I
look for the concept behind
the piece and then see if it
matches the object,” said
Desmett.

“Judging art is hard in the
sense that it's very
subjective,” he added. “You
trust yoursensibility because
judgement [of art] is only as

Level of campus apathy reaches new heights

I have finally given up all hope for this
campus. There’s too much apathy for any one
person to stand.

I have received so many letters about the war
that my head is still spinning. Yes, we should be
there  No, we shouldn’t be there  Look out,
Armageddon is coming  I’ve heard it all. I
guess people are trying to show me that they
really care about the war and what happens —
whether or not our troops should be involved
in the conﬂict. This is all fine and dandy, but I
don’t think that this campus does care.

Last Wednesday, Walter Cutler, the former
ambassador to Saudi Arabia, came to Pitt to give
the university community an unbiased, inside
look into the current crisis. Personally, I thought,
“Hey, this is a great opportunity to find out what
the heck is really going on from somebody who
would know.”

So much for my idea. Cutler came and gave
a speech to approximately '50 people. The Pitt
Program Council, expecting a much larger
attendance, opened the David L. Lawrence
Auditorium for a big crowd and got 50 people.
There was a crowd almost as big at the press
conference beforehand.

This campus doesn’t care aboutwhat happens
over in the Persian Gulf. Oh, sure, people care
about their family and friends, but do they really
care about the politics or the reasons why we
are there? I don’t think so.

The Faculty and Staff for Peace in the Middle
East has been attempting to hold a moratorium
on classes to talk about the war. On Friday, Pitt
President Wesley Posvar came out with a
statemen_t,s_a_ying that the university would not

Tatusko

 

have a moratorium because other issues “have
been passionately discussed without closing
down university functions.”

Now, Lord knows I don’t agree with "this
administration on many issues. This, however,
is one of them. A moratorium on this campus
would not work because nobody wants to sit
down and discuss the war. All anyone wants to
do is argue about the issues and see if they can
persuade anybody to their point of view 5-
which I do believe is impossible at this time. A
moratorium is not for debate; it is for calm,
rational discussion —- which will not happen.

OK, before anybody yells at me, “How can
you expect to know everything that’s going on,
O proud columnist?” —- look, I understand that
I don’t know everything about this issue. No-

body does. But I have read enough about what ,

has been happening — not since Jan. 15 but
since Aug. 2, when this crisis really started —
that I feel that I have enough information to
form some sort of intelligent opinion.

So go ahead. Argue all you want: It’s not '=

going to change anything. Neither will a
moratorium.
But the university not only doesn’t care about

what happens in the war, it could also care less ‘

about what happens on its own campus. (Now
that I have had a chance to pat the administration
on the back, it’s time to yell at it as well.)

Here’s an example: Since the university has
graciously decided to change its policy of
giving public information to the public (namely
the campus police records), The Pitt News has
raised its voice in protest. Unfortunately, the
rest of the students haven’t raised too much of
a stink. ’

I guess that the campus does not really have
the need to look at these records, save for the
errant term paper. But you really should care,
if for nothing else to read more of the Campus
Police Blotter, which obviously can no longer
appear. -

Apathy on this campus, however, is not
exactly new. Look at the Pitt football games this
year, and tell me that this campus cares about
anything. Granted, the football team had a
disappointing year at best, but a crowd of a little
over 16,000 on Senior Day, even against Temple,
is an inexcusable form of apathy.

The same is true for the basketball team.
Although Pitt has been in the Top 20 for almost
the entire season, many times Fitzgerald Field
House sounds more like a morgue than a gym.
Nobody cares. '

Look, prove me wrong. Show that you do
care about these issues. Find out more about
what’s going on, and make your own opinion.
Just don’t spout off about things that you know
little about and expect the world to listen.

Expand Choice Dollars to localeateries

It’s a fact. Most females love to
shop, and shopping with plastic
makes it all the more fun. Why?
Who knows why? It just happens.
We can buy anything with plastic
 clothes, cars, a college education,
food  Wait a minute! Food?

Yes, food. For those of you who
have ever gone into Burger King,

just happen next fall.

The Student Government Board
is considering extending the Choice
Dollars program to various estab-
lishments around the Oakland area
— a service that will definitely
benefit Pitt students.

So what’s the problem with
Choice Dollars now? Why does it
need to be improved? I’ll tell you
why. Once you've eaten in Lothrop,
the Towers Cafeteria, Schenley Cafe
or Roy Rogers a million times each,
you need variety. You need fun!
Once you know the cashiers at a
fast—food restaurant, YOU’VE BEEN
THERE TOO OFTEN! Likewise, if

the cafeteria by "name — unless

you knew them before they started
— you need a change!

Wouldn’t it be easier to eat any-
where you wanted? How many
times have you complained about
having to use your‘ MAC‘card for
every‘ little thing you need? What if
your Choice Dollars worked at Rite
Aid? You know those days when
you're craving Burger King French
fries but don’t have enough change?

Doesn’t it seem a waste to have to

MAC:for just a large fry?

This extension of Choice Dollars '

is affectionately called PittCard. And V

PittCard will cost MONEY— money

that the SGB doesn’t necessarily -
' have.

The SGB hopes that‘ the
university will contribute a dollar
for each dollar the-SGB puts toward
PittCard. Of course, there are other
problems, such as getting vendors
to agree to the system and finding
ways to pay for the not-exactly-
inexpensive scanning machines.
If you support the SGB members,
write a letter and tell them. Write
a letter to the university ’and con-

vince it that Choice Dollars needs .

to be extended! If enough people
want this, it will happen. But it
needs your help. .

The SGB will most likely use

money from student activities fees ’

to pay for PittCard. If it needs to

raise the fee, so be it. I’d be willing_-

to pay a few extra dollars per
semester to be satisfied with my
meal plan, and I hope those of you
that agree with me will let the SGB
know.

E1got.o/réliy wrong but illegal — and '

It was with supreme irony that
Chrissy Cortazzo’s column on the
Middle East appeared two days
after the talk by the former U.S.
ambassador to Saudi Arabia. In her
column she goes to great lengths to
prove that this war is not about oil
but about freedom for Kuwait. If
she had gone to the talk she would
have heard no mention of the right
of small nations to be free. Instead
she would have heard the ambas-
sador state clearly that this is a war
for oil and to protect our “vital
strategic interests” in the world.
The ambassador even went so far
as to argue that until we wean
ourselves from our dependence
on imported oil, we should be
prepared to go through this again.
No grand causes, no crusades, no
“making the world safe for de-
mocracy,” just plain, old-fashioned
geopolitical interest. Let me remind
you that this came not from some
anti—war protester but from a former
ambassador in both the .Reagan
and Bush administrations.

There are two other points in her
column that need to be addressed.

First, she states that “Our troops —

our brothers, sisters, husbands,
wives and friends —— are  fighting
for this (Kuwait’s) freedom, . (‘its
citizens’ sense of security’).” If this
statement is true, then will we now
intervene in Northern Ireland, the
Baltic states, and most importantly,
Lebanon again? If this is true, then
how can we justify the invasionlsl

of Grenada and Panama and our‘

actions in Nicaragua and El Salva-
dor? By her reasoning, should there
not have been a U.N. force to. stop
us in these instances? Or does the
right to security and sovereignty
only exist when a nation fitsinto
what we consider our “vital national
interest,” as the ambassador said?

The last point pertains to the

issue of the troops’ morale. Ac-
cording to her, no matter what we

that the anti-warlprotests hurt the

war effort and prolong the war, .

thus increasing the casualties.
Therefore, we are allowed to‘ dis-

-agree with the war, but we must

keep our mouths shut and go home
until the war is over so as not to
prolong it. If I accept blindly a war
that I know is wrong and which
could‘ have been avoided, then, by
taking this reasoning to its logical
conclusion, I would give the U.S.
government the freedom to com-
mit our troops‘ anywhere in the
world. Then I would have to sup-
port that particular war or inter-
vention so that I would not hurt the
morale of the troops and prolong
the war. I guess all of the "good
Germans” felt the same way when
the Nazis blazed into the Soviet
Union to annihilate the Jews and
the Bolsheviks [...l ’ ‘

Not a war for freedom

Letters

edition where she states, “Free-
dom and the rights of people in this
world is something we will fight
for.” l...] She has shown a miscon-
ception shared by most supporters
of the war that this is a principled
war based on freedom.

Over the past 100 years the United
States has invaded Latin America
more times than you can say,
“baseball and apple pie.” The U.S.
does not care about the freedom
and sovereignty of other countries.
American support of the Contras
and mining Nicaraguan harbors,
aiding Israel’s violation of interna-
tional law by oppressing the Pal-
estinians who certainly had their

homeland taken awayland the"
V [assassination] of politicalleaders

abroad who do not suit American
interests prove that the autonomy

' of other nation—states is not at the

top of the list of priorities for
American foreign policy.

There are many injustices that go 3

on in the international community
that the U.S. ignores and sometimes
even supports. George Bush is
feeding us this cornball line about
defending freedom and our way of
life. Monarchical Kuwait does not
represent the American dream. Iraq
is actually the only country in the
gulf that will not put you in jail for
practicing Christianity. The idea of
our freedom being threatened by
Iraq is a ridiculous notion fed to us
by Bush that the public has finally
latched onto to justify the war. My
rights as an American are more
threatened by the enormous eco-
nomic strain being caused by this

war. The deficit will grow as_ edu-_

cation and the nation’s infrastruc-
ture fall apart. Critics of the pro-
testers mention that they are pro-
testing against the troops who are
ﬁghting for their right to free speech.
I still have not figured out how the
invasidn of Iraqhas defended my

civil liberties. This nation’s prin- .

ciples of freedom and equality were
not founded on invading other

countries which step out of George

/Bush’s order.

I-do believe most supporters of by
the war in that this is notjust about '

oil. I am certain [Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein would have been
happy to sell us Kuwait’s oil. The

‘world’s ‘oil supply would have re-

mained the same, and the market
would have adjusted to the in-
creased holdings of one seller. A

. believer in the free market like
' George'Bush understands that; If

one source controlling a greater
proportion of a valuable corn-
modity is the‘ problem, then maybe"
someone should have invaded the
US. during the Reaganornic ’80s,
in which an unbelievable amount
of corporate mergers took place.
No, it is not just about oil. It has got
to do with Bush’s new post—Cold
War world order. The Soviets have
arguably dropped from the position
of superpower, and now American

' foreign policy can be carried out

without a countering force. Bush

..has= put .-his personal prestige on»-

~ puazle every day

the line. He is going tobeat the
wimp factor and be the world’s
policeman, and no one can stop
him. Do Americans really want to
get into wars like this across the

not think so. [...l

Too much Libertarianism

Daniel Alman is so enamored of
libertarianism that he will use any
argument to support it without
thinking about what he is saying or
pausing to consider whether what
he is saying is supported by his-
torical evidence.

He claims, for example, that
high crude-oil prices last summer
encouraged oil producers such as
Saudi Arabia to increase oil pro-
duction. In fact, oil producers raised
production at the behest of the U.S.
and European community. Oil

. prices stabilized but remained high

— not due to any supply disrup-
tions but due to speculation thata
war between Iraq and the U.S.
would further disrupt supplies. The
day that war broke out crude-oil
prices plummeted $7_ .50 a barrel—
even though the war in the Persian
Gulf has made itmore, not less,
likely that oil supplies from northern
Saudi Arabia will be disrupted.

Clearly, oil prices not only reflect . ‘

the reality of supply and demand

but also the whim of speculation .

and rumor. .. _ I ,l

As for higher prices encouraging
commuters to use mass transit, I
would note tha_t:_.publi‘c transporta-
tion in Pittsburgh has become more
expensive, and" ridership has ac-
tually.decreased ‘during the last
few months.

Finally, Mr. Alman states that “as
long as the government.doesn’t—

- control the pricelof oil], there will

be no shortages." He is deadwrong.

Oil is a finite resource, and even-
tually the worldwill consume all of
it. Americans currently enjoy low

Iconsumer fuel prices compared

with Japan and Europe, and this
discourages conservation. and
tempers, support for alternative-
energy, research projects. T his}
makes it more likely that when the
world runs out of oil, there will be
nothing to replace it. ,
Although I agree with Mr. Alman
on some points, it seems that he is
more concerned with creating ar-
guments (and sometimes facts) to
support libertarianism than with
finding hard evidence to support
or refute his position. Moreover,
before Mr. Alman» writes another’

"column on libertarianism‘, I think

he should consider the fact that
without,goverr1,r:j1ent regulation he .
probably couldn't afford $11,000 a
year in the free market for a private

school!

leads men

to Victory

By Jim Lakely
Sta_[f Writer

The Pitt men’s swim team
entered Trees Pool last
weekend as the underdog but
emerged as the Big East .
Champion. The Panthers held -
off a late Villanova rally,
capturing their ninth
consecutive title to go with
Chuck Knoles’ Big East Coach
of the Year award.

Every Pitt team member
scored points, keying perhaps
the Panthers’ greatest team
effort in recent history.

“Just sticking together as a
team was the key,” said Joe
Kozlina. “In the past couple
years, it was more of a team of
individuals trying to make their
NCAA cuts, but this year
everyone really came
together.”

“It was great that every team
member scored points,” said
Pitt co-captain Dave Schepner;
“I don’t think there has ever
been a time in our team’s
history when that has
happened."

“Coming in we were the
underdog because Syracuse
beat us in a dual meet earlier
this year and Villanova [swam
faster than Pittl,” said Kozlina.

“We were supposed to get third.
I think we just pulled together
and swam well.”

_ Although Pitt led the meet from
start to finish, a Pitt victory was
doubtful when the three-day
event began Friday night.

“The only thing that made the
night bearable for us was the
performance of the diving team,”
said Knoles. “Villanova actually
swam faster than us in the water.
They are swimming out of their

minds, but their weakness is
diving.”

Knoles wanted to go into the
final day of competition with a
40-point cushion and got off to a
good start Friday night. Pitt set a
new meet record in the first event,
the 200-yard freestyle relay. Joe
Kozlina, Zac Economos, David
Dodson and Eric Cornell posted
atime of 1:21.35.

late rally

By Arthur Graziani

For the Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swim team
won its ninth consecutive Big
East Championship this
weekend at Trees Pool, beating
Villanova 710-688. But as the
score indicates, this title did
not come easily.

“We knew the competition
was going to be the toughest
ever,” said Pitt Coach Dave
Belowich, who has coached
all nine championship teams.
“But I also knew that the team
would pull it out. It was
definitely a complete team
effort.”

As the final day approached,
the team realized there was a
lot of work to get done. Not
only was it still in second place
behind Villanova, but Syracuse
was making a strong surge.

Pitt fell to third place with
only five events left before the
tide turned. In the 200—yard
butterﬂy Pitt took first and
second — the first time
itrnanaged to get a one-two
finish in a swimming event.
Junior Julie Rocks won the
event, and fellowjunior Noelle
Barry took second.

While the temperature was
dropping outside, the action
inside Fitzgerald Field House was
heating up as the Panther
wrestling team lost a tight 22-21
decision to its archrivals, the sixth-
ranked Penn State Nittany Lions.

Although the Nittany Lions
entered the meet with a superior
13-4-1 record (compared to the
Panthers’ 3-8 record), the Pitt
grapplers seemed more excited
for this match than any other this
year.

. The Panthers got off to a strong
start when freshman Ryan Sella
extended his unbeaten streak to

. four straight matches in the 118-

pound weight class, pummeling
his opponent 15-0 for a technical
fall and giving the Panthers an
early five- point lead.

The lead was short-lived

By Rob Pugliese
For T be Pitt News,

‘In what amounted to one of
the finest performances of the
season, redshirt freshman Ryan
Sella ignited the Pitt wrestling
team with a 15-0 technical fall
over Penn State’s John Evans in
the 118-pound weight class on
Saturday at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Since being inserted into the
starting lineup against Rutgers on
Jan. 26, Sella has wrestled strongly
enough to maintain a four—match
unbeaten streak that also includes
a 5-2 decision over -Kent State’s
Tom Manning on Tuesday night.

It didn’t take Sella long to assert
his dominance on Saturday. A
quick takedown allowed him to
pressure Evans the entire first
period and lead 8-0. He showed
absolutely no signs of letting up
in the second with a reversal,
adding to his growing margin. As
the match wore on, a string of
near falls removed any doubt
from the outcome.

Hockey club loses to first

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Pitt hockey club posted its
second league loss of the season
to the West Virginia Mountaineers
yesterday at Golden Mile Ice
Complex 5-4.

The Mountaineers (10-0-1) are
in first place in the Western
Pennsylvania College Hockey
Association, followed by the
Panthers (7-2-1) and the Indians
(7-2-2) of Indiana University of
Pennsylvania.

The Mountaineers set the pace
of the competition early in the
first period, scoring three
consecutive goals, and the
Panthers fell victim to their own
erratic skating.

According to Pitt Coach Jeff
Bele, the Panthers were not
mentally prepared early in the

mpetition.

The second period found the
Panthers trying to clear their zone
of Mountaineers.

The WVU squad managed to
net two additional goals, while
the Panthers were able to score
only one unassisted goal, upping
the score to 5-0. Scoring the
Panthers’ first goal was Kip Linse.

“The first two periods we played
really sloppy," said Dave Koval,
the Panther team captain. “We
came out ﬂat, and they came out
hot like they always do. Before
you knew it, it was 4-0,’ and it's

. hard to come back from that."

During the third period, both
teams came onto the ice with
more energy than they displayed
in the beginning of the
competition.

Hollis is from P_enn Hills and
has been playing for WVU for
three years. “He's a good goalie;
he covered the goal very well,"
said Bele.

Scoring the ﬁnal three goals for
the Panthers were Bill Crousey
andjim Calpin, with assists going
to Ed Gorgorchik, Brent Spitzer,
John Carlins, Don Fedor and Steve

“I’m really proud of the way we

Panthers put the past behind them, scratch '

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

After getting annihilated on
national television at UCLA, 112-
85, eight days_ ago, Pitt Coach
Paul Evans told his team to put
the game——— and the season up to
that point— behind it. Wipe the
slate clean. Start over.

“I think at the end of UCLA was
as low as you can go, ” said Evans.
“I told the kids to look at the
future and play strong for the rest
of the season.”

That advice seems to be
working thus far. After an 82-74

. victory against the Boston College

Eagles on Saturday night, the
Panthers stand at 2-0 in their new
season. I

Not that Evans will give up any
of the Panthers’ 15 wins B.C.
(Before California), however.
After the Boston College win, Pitt
stands at 17-7 overall, 6-4 in the
Big East Conference, one game
behind Syracuse and George-
town.

Seventeen wins has always

been a mortal lock for an NCAA
bid, at least as far as the Big East

is concerned. No Big East team__

has ever won 17 games and
missed the NCAA Tournament,
but the Panthers know they still
have a long way to go if they
want to last in the postseason.

“We were lucky to come out of
this one with a win,” said center
Bobby Martin. “We didn’t play
well, but we played well enough
to win. There are no easy games
in [the Big Eastl.”

And the Panthers have no easy
road to the NCAAs either. They
still have road games left at Seton
Hall, Georgetown and Syracuse,
and St. JOhn’s iantl Connecticut at

' home.

“We can win them all if we put
our mind to it,” said forward
Brian Shorter. “I think we’re where
we want to be to go down the
stretch. We’re improving as a
team. Everybody’s back to where
[we] want them to be.”

It was Martin and guard Jason
Matthews who returned to that
level Saturday against the Eagles.

Martin, playing in his fourth
game since returning from a ﬁnger
injury, led the team with 21 points
and 11 rebounds — his highest
figures since the Siena game last
November.

“I’m glad to see Bob come back
like that,” said Matthews.
“Everyone expected him to come
back and play great right away,
but they didn't know that he
didn’t have any feeling in that
finger for a while, and he had a
tough time holding onto the ball.’’

Matthews, who lost his starting
job two games ago after an awful
performance at UCLA, came off
the bench to score 20, three more

" than his last two games combined.

“I don’t think I was in a slump,"
said Matthews. “My shots were
just going in and out; tonight they
fell in.”

“The way [Matthews] played
tonight, he might never start
again,” said Evans. “I kind of like
him coming off the bench. Now
we’ll see if we can work that into
his mind.”

Matthews, however, didn’t
seem thrilled at the idea. When
asked if he thought he should
start, Matthews responded, “That’s
not my decision. That's the
coaching staffs decision.”

And when asked whether he
would mind coming off the bench
for the rest of the season,
Matthews only stated, “No
comment,” and later added, “It
takes me longer to get going
when I come off the bench.”

Clanitoba, the team continued its annual
tradition of Jekyll and Hyde road play
by getting bombed 6-2 at the hands of
the Jets. The Pens dropped their third
straight on the road and sixth in their last
eight away from the Igloo, falling to 29- »
25-3 on the season.

It started early, as it has during the
recent road slump. Bryan Marchemant
scored his first NHL goal, and Phil
Housley, who played a tremendous
game for Winnipeg, banked in his 17th
goal of the year to give the Jets a 2-0 lead
after one period.

This is now a serious problem for the

. Penguins on the road. Not only have

they gotten behind early, they have
been behind by three and four goals,“
making it nearly impossible to come
back, even with their plethora of
offensive wealth.

The second period proved to be the

Cry Freedom:

threes in the first half. That was big.”

“I wasn’t getting many shots, so I was
just thinking of getting it back outside to
the guards for the three-pointers, and that
worked every time," said Shorter, who
was held to only two points in the first half
and six for the game. -

In recent games the team has had trouble
when forced to go to the outside game, the
most outstanding example being the 112-
85 loss to UCLA a week earlier. A large
early deficit and the inability to score
inside forced the team to turn to its outside
game. The Panthers made only eight of 27
shots from three-point range.

On Saturday, with the inside shut off
early, the team was able to successfully

turn to its long-range game. It hit nine of
14 three-pointers in the ﬁrst half, 10 of 19
overall. The team hit 52.6 percent of its
three-point attempts, compared to only 40
percent of its two-point shots.

That was the most three-pointers and
best percentage the team has hit since
Dec. 6 against Marshall, when the team hit
14 shots from beyond the are for a 56-
percent clip.

Darelle Porter and Sean Miller each hit
three treys Saturday night, and Matthews,
who relieved Ahmad Shareef for the second
straight game, seemed to ﬁnd his stroke.
Matthews hit four three-pointers on the
way to a 20-point night.

“I don’t feel like I've been in a slump

from a rhythm standpoint - maybe from
a statistical standpoint," said Matthews.
“From a rhythm standpoint, I've been
feeling pretty good, and the shots have
just been going in and out.”

Matthews’ most important shot of the
game may have been the only two-point
shot he made all night. The Eagles scored
five straight points to pull even at 6.1 for
the first time since the first half with just
over seven minutes left. Matthews hit a
ninner from the baseline to put the Panthers
back on top, and BC was not able to catch
up again.

“When they start Matthews, they have
five guys who are all capable of scoring 20
points on a given night,” said O’Brien.

ANALYSIS

nail in the coffin as the Jets beat goalie
Torn Barrasso three times and led 5-1
after two periods/‘Barrasso, playing for
the first time in five games after sitting
outwith a finger infection, was ineffective
but not totally at fault.

The Penguin defense was awful,
particularly Larry Murphy and Zarley
Zalapski, who were both minus-three
on the night. Murphy gave up the puck
twice in his own end, which resulted in
Jet goals. Double Z refused to use his
body and allowed two goals from in
close. 

Mario Lemieux returned to the Pens’
lineup and scored the third goal of his
young season. He also assisted on Mark
Recchi's 28th goal, which came in the
second period.

Lemieux has been dominating every

game he has played in this season,’

proving once again that he is no mere
mortal. He’s returned like he has to

prove to the world that he is the
greatest player alive. He made an
unbelievable rush on Friday night,
decking three Jets and goaltender
Bob Essensa, only to miss the net on
the backhand.

But Essensa also shone in the nets,
turning away 35 shots, including some
tremendous saves in the third period
when the Pens showed some signs of
life.

As far as things go for the rest of the
season, the Penguins have 24 games
left: 14 on the road and 10 at home.
The Pens’ recent road slump can be
attributed to their poor penalty killing,
which has now dropped to 17th in
the league.

The Penguins still need physical
defensemen who can not only clear
the crease but clear the puck from
their own end.

The Pens’ defense is going to have
to play more physically, particularly
on the road, where the Pens have
given up 39 goals in their last eight
games, nearly five tallies a game.

Women

also dove impressively, losing the 5—meter to
Ratliff by only .05 of a point to take second in
that event.

“You can’t get any closer than that [in
divingl,” said Ratliff. “But personally I got
everything I could have asked for. I wanted
to win both boards; I won both boards. I
wanted our team to win, and we won. I’m just
really happy.”

On Saturday, Villanova held the upper
hand again. One of the reasons for Villanova’s
impressive swimming was the arrival of Lisa
Flood, who is a member of the Canadian
national team.

Even though Pitt emerged victorious in the
closest championship in the history of the
tournament, Belowich said it’s going to be
even tougher in the future.

“With Miami coming into the league next
year, it won’t get any easier,” said Belowich.
“In previous years our swimmers have focused
on other events because of the lack of
competition. But from now on we are going

to have to focus on this meet, or our’

championship will be in jeopardy.”

Lady Panthers beat Villanova,68-62

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
won 68-62 at Villanova on Saturday,
the first time since 1977 that the team
has won there. Pitt raised its record to
13-10, 8-4 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers have had the

3 youngest team in the Big East all along.

Now, with sophomore guard Maureen
McConnell out with a hip injury and

sophomore forward Jill McE1hinny’s,

playing time being reduced by an injury,
two freshmen, Jenine Joyce and Erin
Maloy, have been forced into the starting
lineup. The team now starts three
freshmen, one sophomore and one
senior.

Joyce had 12 points and a team-
leading 10 rebounds, and Maloy scored
five against ‘Nova. Forward Lorri
Johnson, the lone senior, was the team’s
top scorer with 16 points. Sophomore
guard Lisa Fessler chipped in 12. Senior
center Connie Hurt came off the bench
to score 11 points, grab five rebounds
and tie freshman Jonna Heumrich for
the team lead in blocks with three.

RUN YOUR OWN

Sandy Litkenhouse of Villanova was
the game’s top scorer with 18 points,
and Nikki Benedix contributed 16 points
and 10 rebounds for the Wildcats. ,

Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce was happy
with his team’s shooting from the field,
as the Lady Panthers shot 53 percent
for the game. He also expressed
pleasure toward the team’s defense,
saying that the defense and rebounding
were the reasons that the team was
able to turn a 36-33 halftime lead into
a 52-38 lead midway through the second
half.

One problem that just won’t go away
for the Lady Panthers is free-throw
shooting, something Bruce continues
to blame on a lack of concentration.
They hit only 17 of 29 from the charity
stripe for’-a 60—percent clip. One key to
the Pitt victory was that the-Wildcats
didn’t fare much better.

“They have some of the best shooters
in the league,'and they only hit seven
of 20 from the line,” said Bruce.

The Lady Panthers return home for
their next game, Saturday against Seton
Hall. They won earlier this year at
Seton Hall, 70-58, as Johnson scored 22

Sella

points andJoyce came off the bench to
score 12 and grab eight boards.

They were able to shut down the
Pirate offense, especially leading scorer
Kris Durham, who only scored eight.
Their No. 2 scorer, Kelley Moore, did
more damage, scoring 18.

Bruce expects a tough game because
Seton Hall just lost to Syracuse 61-60,
the first Big East win for Syracuse this
season.

“When you lose to a last-place team,

it’s going to tick you off,” Bruce said.

The Lady Panthers are far from
assured of an NCAA berth.

“Being in the Big East will help us,”
Bruce said. “We have four games left,
and those are crucial.” The other
remaining games are Feb. 20. hosting
Boston College, at St. John’s on the

23rd and at Connecticut on the 25th.

Bruce also I talked . about
improvements the team needs to make
before the postseason comes around.
“We need to get more offensive
consistency. We score in spurts,” said
Bruce. “We average about 73 points a
game. We need to be up around our
average.”

that Pitt had a slight advantage.

“It's going to be nip and tuck,” said Knoles.
“Villanova and Syracuse are beating up on
each other, and we are escaping a little bit.”

In the 100 breaststroke, Don Boyd set the
first of his two meet records at 56.25.

Going into the final day of competition, the
team surpassed Knoles’ goal with a 43-point
lead. Yet the coach was still very concerned
about the outcome.

Injuries were Knoles’ main concern, as Matt
Porter and Economos pulled muscles and did
not swim the final day.

By Sunday, Syracuse was out of the picture,
and the title came down to Villanova and Pitt.
The Panther coaches calculated a 27-point Pitt ,
victory. Any disqualification of a swimmer
could have proven devastating, and Knoles’
biggest worry came true.

Fred Constantini was disqualiﬁed in the 200 ,
backstroke, and Pitt lost 15 points. Villanova’s
Chris Desmaris set a new meet record, and the
Wildcats pounced on Pitt’s lead, cutting the
score to 602-601.

“After the disqualiﬁcation, I was worried for
about 20 minutes,” said Knoles. “But I stayed

calm,

Panther Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said that Se1la’s
victories have given the team a
much needed boost.

“Any time you can get a win at
118, it makes a big difference,”
said Stottlemyer, who wasn't
concerned with the caliber of
opponents that Sella has wrestled
during this recent streak. v“He’s
stepped in and won matches for
us, which is the bottom line, ” said
Stottlemyer. _

Stottlemyer was especially
pleased with the big victory Sella
contributed against archrival Penn
State. ’

“I can’t say enough; he did
exactly what he was supposed to
do. He went out and hammered
him,” said Stottlemyer.

According to Stottlemyer, Sella
is a very hard worker who wins
with a basic approach to wrestling.
“He’s not a ﬂashy kind of guy.

He’s not a Sean Gibbs or a Scott

Hovan. He’s pretty basic out
there,” said Stottlemyer.

Pitt wrestled very well against
the sixth-ranked Nittany Lions
before falling short 22-21. Sella
said that this is a “really intense
rivalry” for the team, but he didn’t
prepare himself any differently
for this match than he would any
other. ‘

“I knew it was a big match for
the team, and I just wanted to
start it off on the right foot,” said
Sella. He didn’t think that the
disappointment of coming so
close to beating Penn State would
hurt the Panthers at all. “We’re
always really close, and it’s always
great to go up against a nationally
ranked team,” said Sella.

Sella has overcome a nagging

shoulder injury that has been
bothering him since last year.
, “If we can carry [momentum]
over this week, then we’ll have a
really good shot at [Eastern
Wrestling Leaguesl,” said Sella.

, 154-pound levels, respectively. -

The Panthers returned to the
win column as sophomore Steve
Budman met Chad Dubin for the
bragging rights in the 142-pound
weight category. Budman proved
the tougher of the two, scoring

seven takedowns on his way to a M _

15-5 romp, and more importantly, 

trimming the Penn State lead
down to 10-9. ,

The next match provided the
most evenly matched contest of
the evening at the 150—pound
weight area as Pitt junior Doug
Johnson lost a close 2-1 decision
at the hands of Penn State’s Tim
Wittman.

Penn State followed the
Wittman victory with another win

at the 158-pound weight class_,.~

with a defeat over Pitt freshman
Guido Gatti.

The match was beginning to
tilt in the direction of Penn State
when sophomore Sean Gibbs

A strolled onto the mat to begin his

167-pound match. Gibbs added a
powerful 12-6 victory to the
Panthers’ cause, raising his
personal record to 11-S-1.

’ Panther junior Joe Hilferty
turned in a gritty performance at

the 177 weight level against Penn ,

State’s Mike Kraftbut came up
short, falling 6-1.

' With Penn State leading 22-12,
Pitt freshman Jeff Kloiber
thoroughly dominated the Nitta ny
Lions’ Fred Koberlein at 190 I
pounds and walked away with
an impressive '1 1-4 win.

In what would amount to the
most exciting match of the day
for the Panthers, heavyweight
Perry Miller squared off against
Penn State’s Marc Padwe in the
final match of the afternoon.

Padwe had defeated Miller the q_

previous three times they had
met and entered this match with
a 15-13-1 record.

Barely 20 seconds into the first
period, Miller pounced on Padwe
and after ferociously wrenching
him to the mat, rolled him onto
his back for the pin. V

take a position on the war, Posvar
said.

“Given the nature of a university
as a haven for freedom of
expression and different
perspectives, a university should
never take a unitary position on
any critical issue of public policy
about which there are varied and
sincere opinions,” said Posvar. .

In his letter, Posvar thanked
FSfP for its thoughtful letter, and
then said he appreciated FSfP’s
candor and commitment.

Dennis Brutus, professor of
black studies and member of
FSfP, said that Posvar’s response
was encouraging.

“I think it was encouraging that
President Posvar didn’t express

opposition to the teach-ins,” said ‘

Brutus.

Jules Lobel, a professor in the
school of law and a member of
FSfP, said that he too is
encouraged by Posvar’s response
but feels the university has an
obligation to do more.

“I was encouraged that
President Posvar has asked faculty
members not to penalize students
who want to participate in [each-
ins; however, I think the university
has an obligation to do more to
promote campus-wide discussion
and dialogue on an issue which
is vital to all of us,” Lobel said.

Budget

year in a row, despite Pitt’s
recommendation for $500,000.

Posvar said Casey's
recommendations will “force us
to make even more difficult
choices which may adversely
affect not only the university but
the commonwealth as well, unless
some relief is provided by the
General Assembly.”

He also mentioned the cost-
cutting measures Pitt already has
in effect, including limitations on
hiring and postponement of
maintenance projects and
equipment purchases.

“In a few days, I and my
colleagues will be in Harrisburg
to argue vigorously on behalf of
higher education in general and
the University of Pittsburgh in
particular,” he said. “The stakes
are high: our ability to deliver
critically needed education and
to enhance the economic future
of Pennsylvania.”

good as the person who’s judging
it.”

This is the first student art
exhibit that has actually
materialized, according to Vitale.
She said that PPC experimented
with the idea a couple of years
ago but only had five entrants.
The exhibit was cancelled. Vitale
said if the event is a success this
year it will become an annual
event

The artwork will remain on
display until Feb. 28, and the
exhibit is free.
