how good he could be until he

Craig Street courtcase

Pittsburgh Municipal Court judge
Jeffrey Manning also heard the case
of Davidjapenga, from California,
accused of damaging stores on Craig
Street.

A police officer told the court that
he watched while undercover as]ap—
enga broke windows at the Citizens
Bank, Irish Design Centerand Quiznos
on Craig Street with a bike lock.

The defense reported that the
businesses estimate their damages at
$15,440. «

DistrictAtIorney Stephen Zappala’s
office is chargingjapenga with three
charges of criminal mischief, one count
of possessing an instrument of crime
and one for a false report. Police tried
to charge Japenga with conspiracy,
but Manning said yesterday that an
ofﬁcer’s testimony in court didn’t

damages  

warrant a conspiracy charge and thus
dropped it.

Japenga, who is being held at Al-
legheny Countyjail, originally told of-
ﬁcers his namewas Eric Blair. <

Aboutsixtyyearsago, amannamed
Eric Blair wrote a novel called “1984”
about government control and pro-
paganda under the pen name George
Orwell.

Japenga’s attorney, Patrick Night-
ingale, said he thought the defendants
identiﬁcation was “in play,” because
the officer said he saw a large group
of people, many wearing similar dark
clothes and covering their faces. Two
other people who had preliminary

ACLU student group hosts , post-7 G-2,0 event

For The Pitt News S

Pitt’s American -Civil’ Liberties
Union student group will hold a
rally today at 5:30 p.m. on the Wil-

liam Pitt Union _lawn for students a

to share their stories about police
action Thursday and Friday nights
and show support for “arrested
yet innocent students,” the group’s
president, Genevieve‘ Redd, said.
Therally will open with an
open-mic segment from 5:30 to
6:15 p.m., during which students
can share accounts of police en-
counters. The ACLU has counseled
arrested students not to speak

publicly for legal reasons. Students _

will then be encouraged to break
into small groups of ﬁve to seven
and discuss their own experiences.
Organizers will distribute a list of
questions with phone numbers for

. public officials and a public phone

number for each off1cial’s office.

The ACLU will ask ‘students to -

sign a petition that will be direct-
ed to University and city officials
“seeking reconciliation, asking
for an open and public investiga-

tion, asking for fair hearings for

students and legal representa—.

tion if requested and asking for

d an apology from the city for what V
' has happened to our community,”

Redd said. I

I There will be four to_ ﬁve police
officers on site to ensure student
safety. No violence is anticipated,
and the goal is peaceful assembly
to hold discussion and sign peti-
tions, followed by peaceful disper-
sal, according to Redd.

   

. 
   ‘ ¥\

At 4:30 p.m. on the Cathedral
lawn, the Thomas Merton Center
will train peace guides who would
like to mediate conﬂict and keep
attendees focused on the task
of peaceful reconciliation, Redd
said.

ACLU-PA will be on site to col-
lect legal statements from students

about their experiences. ACLU— ‘

PA staff attorney Sara Rose will be

present to answer questions and .

ensure on-site legal protection for

students should violence occur. .
The idea for a rally came from
independent students who ob-

served or felt the police presence ’

on campus Thursday and Friday
nights. These students reached
out to Pitt’s ACLU for help in or-
ganizing the rally and obtaining a
permit. One student, acting inde-

q ' pendently, printed and distributed

ﬂiers for an event on the Cathedral

lawn today dubbed Black and Blue ~

and Gold.

The ﬂier said, “Speak out in
support of Pitt students and all
others unjustly arrested, gassed,

shot, beaten, sprayed, locked out -
'of their homes, shoved off their ’

sidewalks and dehumanized by an
overwhelming military and police
clampdown on our soil.” ’ ’

There is no permit for this
event, despite claims made on
the ﬂier, and it will not take place.
The student who made theﬂier
is now in coordination with the
ACLU rally for Thursday night,
Redd said.

Dean of Students Kathy Hum-

‘ phrey’s office approved only the

reservation for the Pitt ACLU
event.

For Pitt sophomore Pat Every, it all
started with a slight temperature.
Then came the back aches. A
stuffy nose. Severe fatigue.
And next, the diagnosis: H1N1.
“I was like, ‘Oh great. This might
be the swine flu,”’ Every said of his

worsening symptoms. “I just [have]
bad luck like that.”

With his diagnosis, Every joined
the more than 310,000 people
worldwide who have contracted
the H1N1 virus, according to the
World Health Organization.

And the virus is not just conﬁned
to Oakland. Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg announced Tuesday in
a statement that there have been

with swine flu on

reported cases of inﬂuenza-like
symptoms on all of Pitt’s regional
campuses. '

Every said that when his symp-
toms quickly worsened, he decided
to visit Pitt’s Student Health Ser-
vices for a solution.

But when he described his ﬂu-
like symptoms to the doctor, Every
was diagnosed with H1N1 e with-
out an actual swine ﬂu test.

“I thought it was kind of odd,”
Every said of his test—less diagno-
sis.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
that since it is an outpatient service,
Pitt Student Health does not offer
official H1N1 tests to students. ‘

“Conﬁrmatory tests are only
conducted on those individuals
that are hospitalized,” Fedele said
in an e-mail. '

Campus

Instead of a test, he said the CDC
recommends that doctors assume
that all patients with an influenza-.
like illness have the H1N1 virus.

Though symptoms of the H1N1
virus vary —, including congestion,
runny nose, fatigue, fever or sore

_ throat — Fedele said that “there is

not a single distinguishing symp-
tom that conﬁrms [an inﬂuenza-like
illness] .” T

H1N1 patients self—isolate

Swine 4 2

Pitt senior Julia Lynch is also among the-
students whom Pitt Student Health physicians
diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. '

The marketing major said she ﬁrst felt

’ ill while out with her friends on a, Thursday

night, and her body ached sobadly that she
had to go home to rest. =
By Friday night, she had reached a, tem-

perature of 102.8 degrees and could barely

move.
“I was just on ﬁre,” Lynch said. “I felt like
I was run over by a train.”

Her roommates knew that she was ill, and ‘

one drove her to Student Health Services.
As per protocol, the physician did not is-

sue an H1N1 virus test but instead diagnosed

heron the spot. '
Lynch said the physician gave-herstrict

I instructions to self—isolate — that is, to con-

ﬁne herself to her room and have minimal
contact with others — because the virus can
be highly contagious.

of a sleepy blur. .

“I slept. I basically slept all [day] ,” Lynch
said. “I’ve never slept so much in my life.”

Both said they spent time ﬁghting oif
nausea in their rooms — Every sleeping and
watching TV on his laptop, Lynch reading and
catching re-runs of “True Blood” online.

During their illnesses, Every and Lynch
said their professors were understanding of
missed classes, allowing them to make up the
work when they felt better._

Even with such sympathy, Lynch said the
missed work was a hassle.

“I wish it had been earlier in the semester,”
she said. I «

She also said,she found support from her
parents, including her mother, a nurse who

sent a “get-well” care package and called to

offer tips for a speedy recovery.

Every’s parents c‘ouldn’t visit him in Pitts— I

burgh but consistently texted him to check in
with a close of humor, he said. I ‘

I felt like I was runover by a train.

The doctor also recommended that she
continuously drink ﬂuids, take aspirin or a
fever-reducing medication and get plenty
of rest. " ’

But the most memorable of the doctor’s

orders‘? “They gave me a face mask,” Lynch A

said. . .

Like Lynch, Every said the face mask was
the most unforgettable part of the diagno-
SIS.

Every said his yellow mask — which ex-
tendedfrom the bridge of his nose to the tip
of his chin, covering his mouth and nose — at-
tracted plenty of attention from passers-by.

“I felt weird. I felt so weird,” Every said.

He said people passing him on the street
stared at his mask and quickly moved out of
his way. . A

“They deﬁnitely were apprehensive to be

near you,” he said. “Because [the H1N1 virus _

is] new, people areafraid of it.”

But the mask was the least of his worries,
Every said, because all he wanted to do was
sleep.

After he made it back to his room, he said
he “just kinda passed out when I hit the bed,
which was nice.” I

For both Every and Lynch, the days fol-

_ lowing the H1N1 diagnosis were somewhat

“My dad kinda laughed, because right I
_ when the whole swine ﬂu thing happened,

I was like, ‘Yep, I’m gonna get that,’” Every
said. 4 I
Heath Lattanzio, a Pitt sophomore, is
one of four roommates who shares a suite in
Brackenridge with Every. ’
He said he wasn’t concerned about catch-

ing the Virus, because Everyonly seemed to

be very sick for about a day. .

“I’m in the same room as him, so if I caught
it, I caught it,” Lattanzio said. “I really didn’t
think it was that big of a deal.”

Lattanzio said he’s seen people become '

more ill with the seasonal ﬂu than with the
H1N1 virus. '
“None of us ever got [the virus] from
him,” Lattanzio said. “[It’s] not too much to
be afraid o .” ‘ ' '
Lynch’s roommates were also supportive,
volunteering to bring her food.
But they might not have been as lucky as

. Eve'ry’s roommates.

“I think I accidentally got one of my room-
mates sick,” Lynch said. “All I can hear is her
coughing.”

Both Every and Lynch said they aren’t sure

how they contracted the H1N1 virus, but Every _

said that it’s not a terrible one. .

Student: ‘I don’t feel like it was that big a deal’

Swine 4 4

“The ﬂu, I know, is a lot worse than this,”
he said, comparing the H1N1 virus to the sea-
sonal ﬂu, which he contracted last year. “From
having it, it just didn’t feel like it was asbig a
deal as people make it out to be,” he said.

He said that his recovery moved more
quickly with the H1N1 virus, with his fever
breaking in less than 48 hours.

Lynch agreed.

“I feel like this one moved pretty fast,”
Lynch said. “I was only completely down and
out for 30 hours.”

She said that both ﬂus made her feel “re—
ally achy,” but the largest difference was the
symptoms. The seasonal ﬂu used to make
her nauseous, while the H1N1 virus caused
a very high temperature.

Despite the differences, though, Lynch
said the H1N1 virus might not have lived up

to the hype.

“I don’t feel like it was that big of a deal,”
she said. “It was just another bug to get over
for me.”

Health oﬂicials expect that college stu-
dents are at the greatest risk of contracting
the H1N1 virus.

Guillermo Cole, a spokesman for the Al-
legheny County Health Department, said in
a previous interview that unlike the seasonal

ﬂu, the H1N1 virus will likely target younger
people.

Those older than age 65 were exposed to
a virus similar to H1N1 between 30 and 50
years ago and thus have some immunity to
it. College students, he said, won’t have that
immunity.

Aside from that, Cole said it doesn’t appear
that the H1N1 virus will be more severe than
the seasonal ﬂu.

Despite the flu’s effects, both Every and
Lynch used humor to overcome the virus.

Every said that he might keep his mask as
a souvenir of his H1N1 experience.

Lynch, however, has bigger plans for her
face mask.

“I think I’m gonna keep it. I was contem-
plating wearing it out for Halloween,” she
said.

“After, of course, I Lysol it down.”

Editorial

Grieving period for
public option over

‘ he public option appears
I to have died. May it rest in

peace.

The Senate Finance Committee
voted down two health care pro-
posals that included versions of the
public option.

While Democrats promise to
submit more bills that include the
public option, such action will only
prove detrimental to the rest of
health care reform.

Universal health care is an in-
credible idea and something all
Americans deserve. Yet, even after
the heated debate has cooled — no

. more assault riﬂes at town halls —

some Democrats still do not support
a public option.

According to The New York
Times, two Senate bills failed by
margins of 15-8 and 13-10, with ﬁve
and three Democrats voting down
respectively. Of those Democratic
senators, only one faces re—election
in 2010, so critics cannot attribute
their dissent to political expedi-
ency.

- The public option simply failed.
It is time to move on.

Continuing the public option
debate will merely stall other nec-
essary reforms to the health care
system, such as ending pre-existing
condition discrimination, providing
for portable coverage and reducing
wasteful spending in Medicare.

Hopefully, future sessions of
Congress can add a public option

with incremental legislation. For
now, members should pass what
they can, and a government health
care program is not viable.

Also, other policies need the" at-
tention of the federal government.
President Barack Obama promised
to focus on three major issues dur-
ing his ﬁrst term: health care, global
warming and education.

He should encourage Congress
to pass health care reform — pos-

. sibly with a strong non-proﬁt co-op

program as a compromise —— and
prepare for a passionate debate on
the environment.

Currently, Democrats are ﬂoat-
ing a bill that would greatly reduce
greenhouse gas emissions through
a cap-and-trade system, according
to Reuters. In the meantime, the
Environmental Protection Agency

announced its intent to put new ,

regulations on emissions.

Republicans will ﬁght this with
the vigor of a gorilla in heat, and
Democrats cannot afford to play
defense on two fronts at once.

‘But Democrats should concen-
trate on this bill as soon as possible,
because passing such progressive
legislation would greatly increase
U.S. credibility at the United Na-
tions Climate Change Conference
in December.

Then maybe Obama can start
talking education. Where’s that
$4000 tuition credit we heard so
much about during the campaign?

Ravenstahl seeks easy way out

Taxing hospitals and universities not the answer

  
 
 

' Mason Herron
Columnist

After introducinghis proposed 2010
budget for Pittsburgh last month,
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said he was
“not wedded to anything and would
welcome [college and hospital offi-

' cials’] support orthoughts orinsights

on how to raise $15 million.” The $15
million is required to help fund the
city’s $899 million in pension fund
obligations. “Cynical political deals
and irresponsible ﬁscal management
have put the pensionﬁmd in its current
predicament,” according to an article
in the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Like many politicians in abind, Ra-
venstahl’s reﬂexhasbeen to search the
city’s books, ﬁnd where he can draw
revenues through taxes and then ﬁnd
justification for raising those taxes.
Ravenstahl has asked college and
hospital officials for their input, be-
cause that’s where he hopestoﬁndthe
$15 million he needs. Hospitals would
be required to pay $25 per inpatient
admission, while undergraduate uni~
versity students would be burdened
with a fee of $100 per year simply for

being students.

Consider this: the city, state and
federal governments collect revenues
through taxes. Some of those revenues
are used to help students pay for col-
lege. Pittsburghwould be taxingthose
same students already receiving gov-
ernment aid. We will be taxed twice
but receive beneﬁts only once.

empt from this tax, but not from the
proposed $100 fee, is puzzling.
Analysts and media outlets have
hailed Pittsburgh as a “recession—
proof” city. It has been touted as such
mainly because the majority of its in-
dustry — health care and education
-—- typically provide jobs regardless
of economic climate. So it’s comically

Ravenstahl has asked college and
hospital ofﬁcials for their input, because ‘
that’s where he hopes to ﬁnd the $15

million he needs.

And there are those who think
government is efficient

Whatmakesthistaxeven more odd
is that students are exempt from the
city’s emergency services tax -—- a $52

armual fee levied on Pittsburgh resi- _

dents who make more than $12,000
a year. The fact that students are ex-

ironic that, if there are industries we
should tax to mend a dysfunctional
city treasury, they would be the two
most integral.

I have some unsolicited advice for
the mayor’s office. Instead of spending
a quarter of a million dollars on silly
things suchas250 trash canswiththe

mayor’s namesake on them, perhaps
use that money to close the $15 mil-
lion deﬁcit.

Or we can examine the Ravenstahl
administration’s haphazard ways of
awarding of development contracts.

In a2008 auctionforthe contract
to oversee construction at the ‘Pitts-
burgh Technology Center, the Urban
RedevelopmentAuthority granted the
contract to McTish, Kunkel 8: Asso-
ciates, the ﬁrm with the highest bid,
instead of awarding a contract to the
lowest responsible bidder as they are
required by state law to do, according
to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

The URA’s contracting practices
are now under investigation by City
Controller Michael Lamb.

Financial shenanigans have tainted

the Ravenstahl administraﬁon for '

nearly its entire duration. -

One year ago, Ravenstahlpromised
thateachawardedcont1*actwould“r —
quire a justiﬁcation form that indicates
the reasons why the contractor was
awarded the contract.”

Ofthe  113 contracts awarded
after Ravenstahl made the pledge,
only two were justiﬁed on the city’s
website.

Inaddition, while the city currently

has a $100 million surplus, whichwas '

acquired by not building any debt, fu-
ture spending in 2011 and 2012 will
eliminate the surplus.

That is why Ravenstahl’s sug-
gestion for taxing Pittsburgh’s most
vibrant industries is ﬁ'ustrating and
distressing.

To the mayor, the tax is an easy
solution to a troublesome problem;
to Pittsburgh, it’s a penalty on its
most burgeoning and indispensible
industries. ‘ ~

Ravenstahl, addressingthe hospi-
tals and universities, declared, “You
need to contribute to the city more

than you are today.”

According to economic analyst
Harold Miller, “One—ﬁfth of the jobs
in the Pittsburgh region  are in the
two most recession-resistant sectors:
health care and higher education.”

Apparently UPMC and Pitt have
not created enough jobs. Further-
more, less immediate beneﬁts have

- also fallen short of the mark.

According to Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg, “[Research] expendi-
tures alone support morethan23,000
local jobs and represent a return of
more than $3.60 for every dollar of
Pitt’s state appropriation.”

UPMC, meanwhile, has promised
to contribute $100 million to the Pitts-
burgh Promise, a program designedto
aid Pittsburgh high school graduates in
their pursuit of higher education.

Ravenstahlwill not always have his

youth and vigor. At some point, hewill «

need to become a true leader.

Hewill need to learn that not every
problemcanbe remedied withan easy
solution. Ifhe fails to do so, the future
ofPittsburgh might not be as brightas
our youthful mayor believes.

Staff Writer
Honor Society
Diesel Club Lounge
Oct. 3

Tickets $15-2o

So what if your grades are less
than stellar? Pop-rock band Honor
Society still wants you to join it.

“We like to tell our fans that
they’re in Honor Society, too,” vo-
calist and bassist Andrew Lee said.
“We’re all in it together, all partying
and dancing. We chose the band
name because we wanted something
that ﬁt us as friends and individuals
but also included our fans.”

The Pitt News caught up with
Lee just before the band prepared
to kick off its Fashionably Late tour,
promoting the debut album of the
same name that dropped on Sept.
15. The tour will be coming to Diesel
Night Club on Oct. 3.

“We’re musicians, so we love
to have a good, strong musical
show,” Lee said. “Obviously when
we aren’t making mistakes, that’s
good. We try to involve fans in the
show, make it a party. We like that
atmosphere.”

Since RollingStone.com named
Honor Society one of the six break-
out bands from Bamboozle to
watch, the band has been busy. Over
the summer, Honor Society opened
for all of the North American dates
of the Jonas Brothers World Tour
while simultaneously headlining
the Full Moon Crazy tour.

“It got a little crazy,” Lee said.
“Some days we did four or ﬁve per-

formances in a day, between morn-
ing radio or TV appearances, a mall
acoustic show, opening [for the
Jonas Brothers] and then playing
our own after—hours show. It was
pretty wild.”

So, what was touring with the
Jonas Brothers like?

“Incredible,” he said. “The whole
tour was amazing. We were already
really good friends with the Jonas
Brothers, and we became friends
with jordin Sparks and her band.
It was like traveling musical sum-
mer camp.”

The friendship between the
bands goes way back.

Honor Society drummer Alex-
ander Noyes went to high school
with Kevin Jonas and played with
the Jonas Brothersébefore joining
Honor Society. Honor Society is
the ﬁrst band signed to the Jonas
Brothers record label. ‘

“It’s really like a dream come
true,” Lee said. “Wewent to Target
the day the CD came out, and we all
bought a copy. To have it ﬁnally be a

- real tangible thing that you can buy

is really cool.”

The album followed the band’s
release of the single “Where Are
You Now” from the summer ﬁlm
“Bandslam.”

“You kind of work your whole
life toward your ﬁrst album,” Lee
said. “We feel like it’s taken us a
while to get to this point, but at the
same time, we feel like its perfect
timing for everything that’s hap-
pening with the band.”

Some songs on the new CD are
co-written with the Jonas Broth-
ers and other musician friends,
but members of Honor Society
wrote most of the songs. Lee said

 

=vr=&'*"“

Members of Honor Society are pretty much champs when it comes to touring at this point.

the band’s writing process is very
collaborative.

“We often start with a song title
or concept and then build the story
around it,” Lee said. “Usually some-
one has an idea of the vibe of the
song, like whether we’re going for
a ballad or a more up—tempo, and
then We put it all together. There
are no real egos here. We’re all try-
ing to write the best song we can
together.”

Lee also said that fan connection
and interaction is very important
to the band.

“Since the start, we’ve tried to
tear down walls between us and our
fans through things like Myspace
and Facebook. Twitter has been
huge in making ourselves very ac-
cessible,” Lee said. “Our fans know
us, and we know our fans, and that’s
really cool.”

One night, while enjoying the
West Coast frozen yogurt chain
Pinkberry, Nick Jonas introduced
the band members to the frozen
treat on theirﬁrst night in Los Ange-
les, and they fell in love with it. “We
were like, ‘What if we just Tweeted

that we’re here [at Pinkberry] and
see who shows up?"‘ Lee said. V
The ﬁrst “Pinkberry Parking lot
Party,” which the band calls “PPPs,”
had 50 or 60 fans come out. The
most recent had more than 400.
“We started doing it more and
more. We’ve been known to “put
on some music and do parking lot

-dance parties too,” Lee said.

Upon being informed of Pitts-
burgh’s own Pinkberry equivalent,
Sweet Berry on Meyran Avenue,
Lee said the band might just have
to stop by.

Switch from album to the stage growing trend in music

From Duncan Sheik to Regina Spektor, a variety of musicians moved to the stage

 
  
 

Kelsey Shea
Asst. A8rE Editor

Rock stars generally scoff at mu-
sicals, but a recent trend raging
through the industry indicates that

attitude is changing.

Popular musicians moving onto
the stage is far from an unprec-
edented phenomenon. F°ol1ow—
ing in the steps of their rocking
forefathers of the ’70s, tons of
artists are writing hit rock operas
and converting them to theatrical

productions.

Over the past year, music fans of
all genres have seen a resurgence
of rock musicians and popstars
applying their writing abilities to
the stages of Broadway and other
theater companies.

After the success of Duncan

Sheik and Michael Mayer’s “Spring
Awakening,” other artists have cu-
riously strayed into the world of
the theater.

Rather than repeating his
Broadway success, Mayer went
across the country to Berkeley
Repertory Theater to work on his

latest project.

Mayer chose an edgier band to
work with to match his new West
Coast location. He decided to create
a musical adaptation of Green Day’s
2004 politically charged comeback
album, American Idiot.

The show draws from and builds

New Avett Brothers LP

one of this year’$best  

Kathryn Beaty
Staﬁ’ Writer

.. ._._.;.Il1;c.AY§I!.B.!:!a1;hers.

I and Love and You _
Sony

Many talented bands boast of members
who call one another brothers — see Kings
of Leon and The Felice Brothers.

The Avett Brothers proves that there’s
more than enough room for one more band
of brotherly love with its majorlabel de-
but, I and Love and You. ‘

The band takes traditional bluegrass,
adds some moonshine and creates a hard-

, edged folk sound with a rock ’n’ roll energy

that leaves a warm feeling in the blood
stream. ' - A -
The album’s lyrics are- poetic in their
simple, genuine approach to universal
stories with a fresh perspective on trite

situations that can be seen even in‘ the .
title I and Love and You. a .

The band worked toward" a quiet ma-
turity on this album that comforts and

on the angsty young characters that Green ‘ V

Day frontman Billy Joe Armstrong created
for the ‘album. A ~

“American Idiot” set box office records at
Berkeley. According to The New York Times,
the theater extended the show’s run by three
weeks before it even opened and again once
the show was running. .

Not long after “American Idiot” ﬁnishes
its run in November, Berkeley Rep will fea-
ture another pop artist’s work with a pro-
duction of Matthew Sweet’s 1991 album
Girlfriend. . ' . -

Girlfriend, Sweet’s ﬁrst commercially
successful album, packs a collection of

sugary-sweet pop tunes about high school V

love affairs.

The Berkeley Theater reproduction
switches up Girlﬁ'iend’s traditional love story
by making both lovebirds in the sweet and
innocent affair male.

Then there is the development in musi-
cal theater that I’m personally most excited
about — Regina Spektor will be the latest
contemporary artist to try her hand on the
stage, broke this month.

With her smooth voice and New York

roots, Spektor managed to bypass smaller

0 stages and move straight onto Broadway for
_ her theater debut.

gives the feeling that the brothers have
lived the music.

I and Love and You is an album where

each song tells one integral part to a com-
plete story..In this case, it’s the story of
love and what it means to live a simple,
humble_life in this world. '

One of the best-crafted and most enjoy-
able albums of the year, this music is for
anyone who likes his lemonade hard and
his bluegrass harder.

 

T Theater rcinterprcts albums

The show “Beauty” is a musical adaptation, V ‘

of the one—act play that Lajolla Playhouse ran
in 2003. The show’s "story is loosely based
on the fairytale of Sleeping Beauty. V ‘ .-

The girly-girl within me ha.sn’t been this

excited since~Working Title Films announced -
‘ that Keira_Knightley would play Elizabeth
Bennet in a new production of “Pride

Prejudice.” . - T V .

Spektor’s pounding pianos and startling
staccatos add a dramatic andromantic qual-
ity to her discography, and fans hope to see
the same in “Beauty.” r

Whether those trademark qualities willbe l

watered down, amped up or totally changed
is debatable since Spektor will be songwrit-
ing with Michael Koria. ' ’

“Spiderman,” another popsta.r—infused
musical, will swing onto Broadway and will
feature music and lyrics by U2’s Bono and
The Edge. A

The musical will be directedbyjulie Tay-
mor (“Across the Universe”), and Rolling
Stone reported rumors thatjim Sturgess and
Evan Rachel Wood might have scored lead
roles, making -it a star-studded Broadway
endeavor. r

Clearly,‘musicals aren’t just for theater

kids anymore, so Broadway vets better get
' ready to party like rock stars.

 attention—grabbing than Elly]ack—

  
  
 

son’s crop of bright red hair —— her
music. ‘ .
Finally arriving on U.S. soil,

.. British pop star]ackson’s (better
 ‘known as La Roux, which appro--
 priately means red hair in French)
 ‘ self—titled debut album delivers
 l precisely the type of electro-pop'
;; -"hits that energetically pull you out
 . of a music rut.

The girl knows how to pump

 out electronic-hits with an edge.‘

 

The album is reminiscent of the

.3 V’8os while remaining relevant to
S the modern music scene.

From start to ﬁnish, La Roux

sounds like she knows how to
entertain a crowd. Almost every
song on the album could be a
chart topper. Standout songs
include “In For the Kill,” “Ti-
gerlily” and “Quicksand.” The
infectious “Bulletproof” will
reverberate in your head for
days.

While La Roux certainly
shows a diverse range of talent,

her slower songs aren’t nearly -

as strong as her club smashes.
Synth—punctuated “Cover My

— Eyes,” for example, isn’t her

beststuff.
A * Her vocals aren’t particu-

‘ larly strong from a technical

standpoint, either. Jackson
sounds like she’s perpetually
trying to sing higher than her
range allows. Rather than be-
ing a disruption, however, her
voice adds character, giving an

‘otherwise standard pop album
‘ as-bitof edge.

Add this album to your Sat-
urday night playlist immediate-
ly. It’ll deliver good results.

Staﬁ Writer

Ken Flagg

The End of Suffering

Label: Incurable Eclectic Re-
cords

Grade: C

Rocks Like: Conor Oberst and
Elliott Smith meet Snow Pa-
trol

Most of The End of Suffering
is pleasant and ﬁtting — what
you would expect from a clear
acoustic pop album.

You’ll want to like this al-
bum. Ken Flagg has the po-
tential to be great, but not
everyone wants to hear about
his less—than-tender relation-
ships.

The winning tracks of the
album win by a landslide. They
stay real and personal while
others feel forced to sound a
certain way.

“Funeral” comes off as

13

(M

morbidly quirky with its refrain,
“Please don’t rob me / I’m going
to a funeral.”

The brassy guitar stands out
from the song’s harmonies arid
ambient horns.

If you could call one song
about a funeral upbeat, this
would be it. The similarly styled
“Blinded” showcases the lyrics
and the music together, creat-
ing a lovely story set to beautiful
sounds.

The same can’t be said for
“Mountain Girl,” which focuses on
the most superﬁcial of one girl’s

ﬁner qualities in a false-sounding '

falsetto or “Accelerator,” which
puts a slightly humorous spin on
empty relationships.

Every band sings about girls,
but there has to be some feeling
behind it to be truly successful.
Otherwise, you get your Warrant’s
“Cherry Pie,” or Sir Mix—A—Lot’s
“Baby Got Back.”

They may be dude anthems,
but they aren’t winning over the
ladies.

last year looking for a way to stay
involved with basketball.

“I decided to be a manager
to stay around the game, and I
wanted to be a part of something,”
Rivers said.

Last season, Rivers would still
play pickup games with the play-
ers before and after practice. They
noticed his talent right away.

I “By being an athlete, you can

i tell if other players have the type
of ability to play at your level,”
sophomore guard Ashton Gibbs
said. “And he had that.”

Gibbs described Rivers as an
excellent shooter who brings a
hard-working attitude to the game
while always pushing the other
players to be better.

Rivers agreed and said that he
is “always the ﬁrst one down on
offense and the ﬁrst one back on

_!3l’efense.” ’
” He is also a quick player who is

good in transition and will spend
time at both guard positions this
season.

With former walk-on Ryan
Tiesi’s departure from the team,
the Panthers had an open walk-on
spot heading into this season.

After last season, Rivers talked
to the coaches — Brandin Knight
and Rasheen Davis inparticular
— and they encouraged him to
work hard over the summer and
try to walk on this season.

He did just that.

“We lifted every day, partici-
pated in all the conditioning, and
I played in the summer league in
Greentree,” Rivers said. “It was
a blast playing with these guys
[in summer league], and I really
felt like this is what I want to do.
I want to walk-on and make this
team better.” ‘

His hard work paid off, as he
had consistently strong perfor-
mances in the summer league,

which was comprised of players
from local schools like Pitt, Penn
State, West Virginia, Duquesne

I and Robert Morris.

Rivers said that being able to
play so well in a league with that
many good players really boosted
his conﬁdence going into this sea-
son. He had severalimpressive
games, scoring 10 points in one
game and 11 in another.

But there’s one question on
fans’ minds: Will Rivers still per-
form his pre—game dance now that
he’s not one of the managers?.

“We’ll have to see,” Rivers said.
“If we can win with it, then we’ll
have to keep it going, but I won’t
do it if we’re losing.”

‘And hopefully the Panthers
maintain their winning ways,
because although he wouldn’t

give any details, Rivers simply"

said, “I’ve got something special
planned for the dances this sea-
son.”

One of the bigger problems head coach Dave Wannstedt faces is

discipline.

Kyle Craig
Staﬁ” Writer

Penalty Problems

In 2008, the Pitt football team
won a number of games by close
margins. A lot of that success can
be attributed to Pitt’s ability to limit
mental mistakes in crucial situa-
tions.

After Pitt’s 38-31 defeat to North
Carolina State on Saturday, it’s ap-
parent that the Panthers aren’t play-
ing with the same type of discipline.
Several times, the Wolfpack beneﬁted
from critical penalties that either
prolonged their scoring efforts or
stymied a Pitt drive. ,

In four games, Pitt has accumu-
lated 31 penalties, an average of 7.75
penalties per game. That markranks
94th in the nation and sixth in the

Big East. Last year, Pitt led the Big
East and was 12th in the country for
fewest penalties committed.

The difference isn’t anything the
coaching staff expected. .

“We bring officials to practice. I ,

promise you we’re not working on
it any less than we did last year,” Pitt
coach Dave Wannstedt said. “Last
year, we led the Big East by a long
shot in least amount of penalties. We
were top 10 in the country in least
amount of penalties. This year, we’re
the worst.” .
Perhaps more disturbingthanthe
number of penalties is their magni-
tude. They haven’t been small infrac-
tions of little consequence. Pitt’s 31
penalties have resulted in 338 penalty
yards allowed. Nationally, only ﬁve
teams average more penalty yards
per game than the Panthers.
Warmstedt indicated during his
Monday press conference that the

reaking downPanthers football

multitude of penalties mightbe an
indicator of his players’ lack of con-
ﬁdence.. .,
“I thinkwhen you get penalties in
some situations a lot of it has to do
with just a little bit of lack of conﬁ-
dence — a little bit of insecurity —at

' being able to execute your assign-

ment,” he said.

If the problem persists for the
Panthers, Wannstedt said that he
will make personnel changes.

“The solution, obviously, is you
emphasize [not committing penal-
ties], and if it continues, the guy can’t
play,” Wannstedt said. “You’ve got to
make a change.” i

Gunn’s Return

ity to the Pitt defense, which was
trampled by North Carolina State
for more than 500 yards of total

New Cowboys stadium

bloated in size, budget  

MCT

Dallas Cowboys ownerjerryjones helped create the Taj Mahal of football stadiums. The
new home for the Cowboys can hold up to 110,000 people and cost around $1.5 billion.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

I was under the impression that the Taj
Mahal was in India. The famous mauso-
leum is considered a world wonder and
the greatest piece of Muslim architecture
ever constructed. It’s a UNESCO World
Heritage Site. It’s a spectacle that has
stood 356 years.

I don’t know how much it cost to build .

the Taj Mahal. It was probably a lot. But, do
you think it cost more than
$1.5 billion? Did the city of
Agra increase its sales tax
by 0.5 percentto help fund
its construction? Was the
hotel occupancy tax in the
county j acked up 2 percent
and the car rental tax by 5
percent? Did Agra just give
the architecture company
$933 million — including
interest, mind you — in

66

Granted, we are all well aware that
much time has passed  but what
went into the Cowboys’ new venue is
just ridiculously gaudy. _ A

time has passed since the 15th century and
now, but what went into the Cowboys’ new
venue is just ridiculously gaudy.

And, despite how I much I dislike the
notion of a stadium, this seems like a flat-
out waste to use it for a mediocre foot-
ball team. What are people going there in
droves to see, anyway? A

Take a look for yourself. The stadium
has the largest high—definition television
screen in the world hanging from its raf-
ters. The thing spans from 20-yard line
to 20-yard line. It’s 11,520 square feet,

bonds for funding?

All of those things hap-
pened forjerryjones to construct the new
Dallas Cowboys’ stadium. For the record,
the NFL also chipped in the customary aid
of $150 million andjones himself covered
numerous other costs. , ,

Indeed, many are dubbing it the Taj
Mahal of arenas.

Granted, we are all well aware that much

which probably means it’s bigger than
your apartment. When the Cowboys take
the ﬁeld, they parade through a gallery
of picture-snapping fans who are lucky
enough to enjoy the game from a bar that
doubles as the team’s tunnel to its locker
room.

To be fair, the stadium will play host to

a variety of other events, such as
the NBA All-Star game in 2010,
the Super Bowl in 2011‘and the
Final Four in 2014. The main ten-
ant, of course, is Jones’ precious
Co'wboys,.

‘ The Yankees, who are the
other organization to recently
build a monstrosity of a stadium
— coincidentally costing_$1.5
billion — at least backed it up
with the best record in baseball
this year.

 -But,‘ America’s Team went into
thelocker room at halftime with

‘ a big doughnut on the board this

past Monday against the lowly,

God-awful Panthers and won’t .

sniff the leagues best record this
season. A

Ultimately, Dallas won the
game 21-7. Cameras caughtjones
celebrating in his royal box like
the team had just won the Super
Bowl. Tony Romo, however, didn’t
throw a touchdown, Felix Jones

joined starting running back
Marion Barber on the sidelines
with an injury and, likel said, it
was against the Panthers. They
have Jake Delhomme (seven in-
terceptions through three games)
as their starting quarterback.

It is true that in the NFL, a
win is a win is a win. They tell
me there are no gimmies.

Butif your team’s moniker is
a giant star, you better have one
playing quarterback, too, and
Tony Romo isn’t all he’s cracke
up to be.. " . ’

Either he tosses three picks‘

and you lose, or he plays it ultra-
safe, and you barely beat a team
in disarray with a pick—six in the
last five minutes. V

Here are the facts: Dallas is
14th in the league in passing of-
fense. Romo is 18th inthe league
in passer rating at 85.2.

He’s 13th in yards per game,
and he’s thrown just one touch-

down since week one against
Tampa Bay — when he threw
three.

Romo is in his ﬁfth season and
hasn’t won a playoff game. Last
year, they were picked preseason
to win the NFC, and they finished
third in their division.

‘ Meanwhile, Jones is building
his spanking new ediﬁce. It’s
grand, and it’s glitzy. _

Hell, it just might be the most
fun place in the world to go to
a sporting event and not even
watch the game.

It’s-pretty huge, too, with an
estimated capacity of 111,000.

It has already set an NFL re-
cord in attendance, when 105,121
people came out to see the Boys
lose to the Giants two-weeks ago
behind Romo’s three intercep—
tions.

Sorry, Jerry, but you can keep
Romo and the new digs. I’d rather
see the Taj Mahal.

offense, is the return of sixth—year
senior Adam Gunn.

Gunn missed the last two games
with a sprained right ankleand was
replaced inthe starting lineup by true
freshman Dan Mason.

Against Youngstown State and
Buffalo, Gunn accounted for 13 tack-
les and ﬁve sacks.

V His absence was apparent as
the Panthers tried to contain North
Carolina State quarterback Russell
Wilson. Prior to Saturday’s game,
Wilson had been sacked 11 times.
Against Pitt, he was tackled behind
the line of scrimmage only once.

“He told me this morning that
he feels the best he’s felt in a while,”
Wannstedt said about Gunn’s re-
turn. “So, we’re optimistic that he’ll
be back.”

Fresh Yardage

Despite a disappointing second
half against North Carolina State,
freshman running back Dion Lewis
is still making noise on the national

scene and in Pitt’s record books.

In four games, Lewis has seven
rushing touchdowns and one receiv-
ing touchdown, makingatotal of zfll
points. This puts him on pace to shat-
ter Lesean McCoy’s freshman scoring
mark of 90 points set in 2007.

6 6 --

He told me this morning
that he feels the best he’s
felt in a while. ' "W

Dave Wannstedt

Lewis remains the top fresh-
man rusher in the nation, averaging
123.25 yards per game. When taking
upperclassmen into account, only
four backs average more yards than
Lewis, and none have more than ﬁve
rushing touchdowns.
