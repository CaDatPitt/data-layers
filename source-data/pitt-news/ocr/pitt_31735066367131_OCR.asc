‘The coming presidential election will present many
‘college students with“ their ﬁrst opportunity to vote.

Far too many‘ of /those eligible to vote in the United
«States do not take advantage of this privilege. College stu-
‘dents, who are educated to the importance of democratic
principles, should take the lead in exercising the right to
_v_c:1)te. B V 1 /
Deadline for registration in Allegheny County is Sept.
19. Students living‘ on campus, who are eligible to vote,
should go to their home towns this weekend to register.
Two groups have organized on campus to stimulate stu-
«dent ‘interest in t-he coming election. “Students for Nixon,”
headed by Beverly Roberts‘, and “Students for Kennedy,”
_headed._ by Rodger Yeager, have begun campaigns to en-
rcouraige registration. '
Plans are being made to'provide sufﬁcient television
sets for students to view the Nixon-Kennedy debates. A
t',.University student, Woody Turner, is state chairman of
f‘Youth‘ for Nixon.” .

Such efforts by students, during a time when
gapathy toward political events is so typical, provide some
ﬁhpope that man will live with man more peacefully when
I membersofeour generation assume their places in govern-
ment ofﬁces.

Perhaps the enthusiasm of these few will be com-
imunicated to other members of the student body, so that
they will not only exercise their right to vote, but also par-
ticipate actively in the coming elections. ’

For Frees  

To those of you who’ are new here we give ad-

rvice in quantity, willingly and sometimes even- a

little frantically. It is atptirnes greeted with a“
modicum of disbelief and more than a little well-
hidden hostility. This is, of course, a good sign.

I havn’t yet found a sacred
"cow lurking behind any upper-
clpassmen. But, ~bright—eyed
world—setters-on-ﬁre, a c c e p t
from us any offering which we
may give, be it advice or just a
hello, as sort of a rose on a
small grave. _ ,

You are settled snugly in
your dormitories now, having
been oriented and re-oriented ad
inﬁnitum, and as likely ‘as not,
you and your Zroommate have

. become blood-brothers for life,» with all due cere-

mony. You’re itching to immerse yourself in what

A you feel’ will be the ﬁrst real work you have ever.

done.

Let this next year or two be a time for hor-
rendous amounts of work spaced at regular, rather
infrequent intervals, because if you are normal you
will be tempted to do the latter; let this be a time
for collossalenthusiasm, preferably noisy; and most
of all, let this be a time for learning, or better still,
a time for finding out. ,

Perhaps’ you have started already. You "are now,
if my calculations are correct, f-requently engaged
in cataclysmic philosophical discussions about life
and what to do ~with, it, often with var kind of
lyrical quality about them which may amaze you
quite a bit. You perhaps have a certain nebulous

intuition thathere, in an academic atmosphere and V

with people amazingly similar to you in ways of
thinking, you will ﬁnd absolute freedom of com-
munication and expression. '
Long-Range Plans

’ And you expect to prepare for a career or .a
way of life with which you can identify‘ your

‘whole self, "where you can say that your work is

your life’s interest. ‘

And your intuitions are not wrong.’ This place
is as good as any for finding out things, better
even. ' A

But, even so, a faint disillusionment is some-
times an occupational hazard with the upperclass-
man; he wears it like a badge, sort of a purple
heart for being wounded_in action. When he says
hello to you, you may detect a certain frightened
expression, as though he had seen a ghost.

Cats Could Post
  8-2 Record With
 A Little Luck

_, ‘By TED COLTON
  Sports Editor

 
 
   

I
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-llIIIIIIIIIIIIV

 
 

With the first Panther grid game coming up this Sat-
urday it seems like a good time for a little “forecast” on the
team’s future. From all available sources it looks like John
Michelosen has come up with a powerhouse.

But there is one drawback. That’s right —— — that W811
known murderous schedule. Does Michelosen have the horses
to go through game after game, meeting the nation’s ﬁnest
teams and still come up on the winning side of the ledger.

Here is what we think will happen: Pitt 22——UCLA 7;
Pitt 14-Michigan State 0; Pitt 2l——Oklahoma 30; Pitt 35———
Miami 21; Pitt 6—West Virginia -0; Pitt 18-—TCU 14; Pitt 14-
Syracuse 13; Pitt 8——Notre Dame 14; Pitt 40-—Army 16; Pitt
8—Penn State 6.

With a little addition here we come up with a 8-2
chart for the Panthers. That’s good enough to get a bid
to one of the major bowls, but maybe this is getting a
little too far out ahead. Michelosen will only shudder if

I someone starts talking bowls before the first game is
played.

That 8 and 2 looks mighty big when you take another
glance at the schedule. Frank Carver, athletic director, feels
this way, “We can lose eight games. I’m sure we will lose
three games and I know we’ll win two. As for the other ones

‘I just don’t know.”

Michelosen’s comment, “We will play them one at a
‘time and see what happens”, Typical Michelosen com-
ment.

The players all believe that the Panthers can have a good
year. “We are good,” said Chuck Reinhold, “there are a lot
of good boys here who want to play football.”

Mike Ditka announced, “If we win the ﬁrst one we can
go all the way. The ﬁrst game might tell the story.” I

Here is a little note for alarm: a few of the Cats per-
formers have been stricken with some sort of infection that
has caused the skin to swell. But it doesn’t look serious and
everyone should ‘be ready Saturday.

Harrier Co-Captains Chosen

To Guide Panth

ers To Victory

Coach Carl Rees can instruct his harriers before they
embark on a cross-country and he can compliment them

afterwards, but it is the task

of his two senior co-captains

to encourage and lead the boys over the courses.
This season the leadership is in capable hands as Bill

Hinchberger and Reed Clark
guiding qualities and outstandingO
sportsmanship to rate the respon-
sibility.

“They'll be very good captains,”
Coach Rees explained. “They are
both well liked and I think they’ll
do a real fine job.”

Contrasting Manner

Hinchberger and Clarke show
similar characteristics, but both»
have contrasting manners too.
Hinchberger is a solidly—construct-
ed boy who is constantly grinning
and who attempts to make tiring
calisthenics and gruelling distance
running a pleasant task, which it
is not.

Reed is slightly built in the
true harrier. fashion and is ex-

The yogi competition is based
on the system of picking winners
in the top national gridiron games
each Saturday. Every~ week the
records of the pickers are tabu-
lated and at the season’s end the
man with the best - record is
crowned champion.

tremely serious about his job.
He hedges the runners on route
to strive for better perform-
ances. He often proves down-

right annoying, but he is most

effective.

Neither boy possesses outstand-
ing ability in running, but both
are hard workers. They are de-
termined to succeed and both have
improved tremendously since they
ﬁrst joined the team four years

_ ago as freshmen.

Core of Team

They have vocational interests
in the same ﬁeld. Hinchberger is
an education major and wants to
be a teacher. Clarke is majoring
in physical education and would
like to coach, preferably track or
cross-country.

Theylboth compose the mid-
dle-distance running core of the
Panther track team. Each has
.won letters in both sports.

Rees is depending on Hinchber-
ger and Clarke to form the nucleus
of a team for which he holds high
hopes. They have “finished con-
sistently” with the front-runners
and should continue in similar
fashion this fall. Their perform-
ance in early workouts gives in-
dication that they will.

thers ﬁnished the season with a

UCLA, on the other hand, has
25 lettermen returning from a
team that posted a 5-4-1 mark.
Coach Bill Barnes, UCLA, has
added a draw series designed to
go with thejsingle wing and

can be expected to pass often,
from anywhere.

In line comparisons there is a 1..

big difference. The Uclans have

line, although inexperienced, has
the horses for the long haul,

tear up enemy passer from his
left end slot. Don Delfine, 195
pounds, is at right end. Steve

Joe Latvi-s are bound to see a lot
of action.

One Experienced Tackle

The Panther’s only experienced“,

tackle is Dick Mills,‘ 230 pounds.
Bob Budavich, 235 pounds, has
shown great promise in practice
and looks like a sure bet to hold
down his left tackle position.
Regis Coustillac, a 220 pound-
er, may notsee action due to a
broken ﬁnger in last week's

Dick Matyus, a 220 pound jun-

Pete Hopchok Readies Equipment

For Gridiron Encounter on Coast

By JIM O’BRIEN

Vvith all the freshly cleaned
white and gold pants and the
blue helmets shining, Pete
Hopchok began to place all
the various equipment into
large boxes used to transport
them.

Tomorrow Pete will drive to
Greater Pittsburgh Airport and

check the luggage"in. The follow- ‘

ing morning it will be on board
with the Panther football players
en route to Los Angeles where the
Cats team opens at UCLA on Sat-
urday night.

Panther varsity athletes know
Pete Hopchok well, but few others
outside of the sports picture are
familiar with the good work this
man has performed. 7

/Bespectacled Fellow

Before and after every practice
session ' the boys approach this
amiable, bespectacled fellow and
request their equipment or return
it to be cleaned. Pete is the
equipment manager whose" work-
shopiis in the dressing room be-
neath the ramps of Stadium. _

He is separated. from the
sportsmen by a wire mash fence
on both sides, but his attitude
and friendly, jovial» personality
draw him close to the hearts of
the young men whom he serves.

He worked eight hours a day in
the summer getting the football
equipment ready for training camp
at Meadville, Pa. During the cur-
rent gridiron practice sessions,
Pete is occupied between twelve
and fourteen hours every day.

Keeps Close Check

He must sort and issue the
equipment and collect it later to

6

be laundered and repaired. Be-

fore the Saturday games he must
polish approximately 45 pairs of
shoes and clean as many helmets.
He must keep a close check on this
apparel all season.

Pete has been performing this
task ‘for six years and is ex-
tremely satisﬁed with his posi-
tion. When asked what partic-
ular boys he remembered, he
stated emphatically, “I never
singled out anybody. I had-no
favorites. They were all the
same. I gave a clean pair of
socks to both the stars and the
second-_stringers—.”

Hopchok has traveled the
entire country with Panther foot-
ball teams. He once toured Puerto
Rico for l3 days with the basket-
ball team.

“You have to worrygall the time
that you left something behind.
It might seem small and insig-
nicifant when you leave, but darn
if you don’t need it when you are
away.”

Just then -a freshman came to
the window complaining about a
looseﬁtting sweat suit. Pete
squinted his eye and smiled,
searching the expansive shelves‘
for a. replacement. It was all
in a day’s work for Pete Hop-
chok, equipment manager.

When the Cats team returns
from the coast on Sunday, Pete
will have to unpack all the soiled
jerseys and togs and sort them
again. It will be a much more
pleasant task if the equipment re-
ceived its wear and tear in a
Bruin downfall with the Panther
eleven returning to school vic-
torious.

The Bruins have two talented
seniors returning to hold down
these spots for the 1960 season.
They are Marv Luster on the left
wing and Earl Smith on the other
side.

Standout Starter

Left tackle Foster Anderson,
who is especially rugged defen-
sively, needs only to improve his
offensive play to be a standout
starter.

Right tackle Marshall Shrik
has futuie greatness written all
over him. He was moved from
guard this spring and took to
his new position in surprisingly
easy fashion.

Center Harry Baldwin looms as
one of the country’s top pivotmen
and linebackers.

Dabov Top Guard

UCLA Se is

By JOHN FLEMING

The UCLA Bruins open their 1960 football season against
Pitt this Saturday. Both teams have received top pre-season
ratings. As these two teams clash in the Coliseum the eyes of
the sports world will be upon them.

The Bruins field a team with 25 returning lettermen.

own as a top guard last year
but he’ll have to battle to stay
there as Tom Paton is ready to
challenge for the top spot.

In the UCLA multiple single
wing attack, the quarterback, or
blocking back is the unsung hero.

Ivory Jones Returns

Ivory Jones, who covers this po-
sition for the Bruins, was UCLA’s
top extra—point and ﬁeld goal
kicker. This senior performer
made one field goal against USC
and wound up the year with 20
conversions out of 22 attempts.

The tail back position will be
taken care of by Bob Smith and
Bill Kilmer. Together they
make a colorful, running-pass-
ing, junior-senior combination
that should carry UCLA to foot-
ball heights.

Gene Gaines and Jim Johnson
will hold down the right half back
position. Gaines and Johnson have
the speed, quickness and ability
to run the gamut of varied wing-
back duties.

Zanicopolous

Top Goalie

Will Zanicopolous strike again?
They say lightning never strikes
twice in the same place. This year

this happen when Coach Bemis
and Company take the ﬁeld.

The Panthers’ favorite All-.
American goalie, “Zeke” Zanico-
polous, returns this year with pro-
mises of being more of a terror
than last year. According to Coach
Bemis, “His quick hands and his
ability to recover makes Zeke
one of the top goalies in the na-
tion.” ‘

At'the end of last season the
booters were rated‘ 13th in the
country. If the defense remains
as. strong as it was last year,
and the offense lives up to all
expectations, the Panthers will
.move up in the national stand-I
ings. »

With such fellows as Zanico-—
polous, “Corky” Cuthbert, Cal
Smith, and Pete Smith leading the
Panthers, there is no doubt that
their rating will be higher this
year. .

Coach Bemis said, “The team is
starting to shape up and a lot of

headway should be made this
week.”
