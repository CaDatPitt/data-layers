since there was no ruling against
a write-in candidate, (from PAP)
being in the elections.
The election of Pinkus, who had
not been notified 'of the restric-
-- tion to" PAP members, had ﬁled
his petition_ properly and was
elected in a proper manner.
Markowitz explained that he
had been at fault in not noti-

to Pinkus.
A STOP, the only party that par-
ticipated in the general elections,
was ﬁned $10 for “unethical prac-
tice” during the elections. They
, were guilty of handing out a party
slate which listed write-in candi-
dates, which was called the “offi-
' cial slate.” ' p
The Committee had not ap-
proved the STOP paper prior to
the elections. Dave Menzer, Poll-
ing Chairman, stated, “Since the
names (write-in) were not a part
of the official slate, they are
guilty of unethical practice.”

’ both the mani- H

" A acts

By Murray Chass

Freedom of expression at the
university is dying.

The time for making_ funeral
arrangements may not be here
just yet; but taking a hint from
events of the
past several :
weeks, th at 7f
time may be "‘
/very near.

According to
W e b s t e r, ex-
pression means

festation and V
the utterance 
of a feeling. It
is these two
that are
being stiffled by the university’s
administration. ‘

Let us look at two of the
symptoms of this dying freedom.

' Several weeks ago, shortly prior

to the visit of Nikita Khrush-
chev, Harry “Woody” Turner,
‘one of— the more prominent stu-
dents on this campus, expressed
to some of his friends his views
on the visit.

“I was opposed to Khrush-
chev’s visit,” Turner said in re-
lating his experience, the first of

i’ the symptoms. “I felt it was not

in the best interest of the United
States to have Khrushchev -
who had been responsible for
the death of many thousands of
his countrymen and peoples of
Eastern Europe —- touring
America with his false promises
of. peace and goodwill.”

Turner also explained that he
was a member of the executive
committee of the Committee for
the Freedom for All People.
Serving with him in this body
were such persons as Judge Lois
McBride and John Brosky; Rev.
Dr. Samuel M. Shoemaker, pas-
tor of the! Calvary Episcopal
Church; and Rev. Robert Kinch-
loe, director of the Council of
Churches of Pittsburgh.

Thought Change

Somehow Dr. John Gcise,.as--
sistant chancellor for student
affairs, heard of Turner’s views
on the Khrushchev visit. That's
when he sent Turner an “urg-
ent” message to see him.

“Dr. Geise wanted‘ to know
my opinions on Kh"rushchev’s

visit,” Turner said. “He told me

at some length vsdiy he thought
the visit was good.” Perhaps if
these had been the only ideas
offered in the meeting, every-

thing would have been all right.,

' the student leaders.”

 

   

But, Turner continued, “It was
made clear to me that the uni-
versity frowned on any overt
manifestation of opposition from
He added
that it didn’t take a genous to
ﬁgure out what Dr. Geise was

_ saying. -

As for the other symptom of
the dying freedom of expression,
the university experienced the
ﬁrst eﬂigial hanging of a coach

in its history last Tuesday. The

“hanging” originally was to oc-
cur Monday night, but a leak in
the plans alerted members of the
administration who quickly con-

 tacted certain students to have

the display called off.
Head off Hanging

One student who had been
heard to say, on the return trip
from the West Virginia game, he
thought Coach Johnny Michel-
osen should be “hanged in ef-
figy,” was called into the office
of Dr. William Swartzbaugh,
dean of students, to relate what-
ever part he might have in the
impending show. 1

Two other students were told

. to get in touch with the various

fraternities and call the “hang-
ing” off. 9

Dr. Swartzbaugh -, explained at
the Student Government Assn.
meeting last Monday why the
“hanging” should be cancelled.
There currently is a bill before
the State Legislature that, if
passed, would grant ‘Pitt seven
million dollars for the construc-
tion of a new library.

Any display such as hanging a
coach in etﬁgy, he said, might
harm the university's chances to
have this bill passed.

Preventing the /ﬁrst “hanging”
was not enough for the admini-
stration, however. Tuesday after-
noon, David Dulansey, Pitt News
photographer," received a phone
call from Dr. Swartzbaugh.
Dulansey had received a couple
of phone calls at different times
Tuesday morning telling him
when he could take a picture of
the dummy. '

Dr. Swartzbaugh, evidently at-
tempting to discover the culprits,
asked Dulansey if he knew who
had called him. Dulansey did
not. ' '

These are the symptoms; now
let us look at the implications
of them.

One"Whole' Body

‘ In the first case — that of
Turner, his views on the
Khrushchev and Dr. Geise — we
shudder to think of future years

at the university when students
will not be permitted to express
ideas contrary to what has been
established by the administra-
tion.

Is this molding of ideas along
a single line part "of the totalin-
stitution we supposedly are striv-‘
ing for? Perhaps these members
of the administration believe the
only way to help Pitt become
“second to none” is to turn out
one “whole” student body.

Perhaps the university is re-
verting to a positionit held in
the 1930’s when academic free-
dom was‘, suppressed. At that
time professors were ﬁred from
1959 Dictionary of Education
their jobs because they expressed
supposedly “radical” views both
within the university structure
and outside.

Although, in his definition,
Webster limits academic freedom
to teachers——he deﬁnes the term
as “freedom of a teacher, es-
pecially a college or university
professor, to express the truth as
he sees it,” ‘and “immunity of a
teacher or professor from loss of
position because of expression. of
individual opinion” - we believe
students equally deserve this
right to free expression of ideas.

Another deﬁnition from the,

says, in part, that academicfree-'s' "

dom should lead “to the end that
education ‘should ever encourage
that continual and fearless sift-
ing and winnowing by which

 

alone the truth can be found’.”
How is this end to be achieved
if Woody Turner is told by Dr.
Geise that he has to favor the
visit of Mr. Khrushchev when he
believes the exact opposite?

Plays Policeman

Turning to the second symp-
tom — that of the effigial hang-
ing — the administration made
a complete mockery of freedom
of expression in the lengths to
which it went in trying to ﬁnd
the guilty persons.

Whether this hanging should
be condoned or condemned is not
important _here. What matters,
however, is the principle behind
it. Shall students at this univer-
sityhave the freedom to mani-
fest their ideas in similarly
harmless acts? As far as ‘we
know, no one was hurt by the
hanging,
Michelosen. As he said when
asked how it felt to be hanged,

' Michelosen said, “I ‘really don’t

know what to say. I’ve never
been hung before.” .

Why, then, after the dummy
had been cut ‘down and no act of
violence had occurred did Dr.
Swartzbaugh continue to act in

a po1iceman’s role_, trying to ﬁnd

the hangmen? We wonder what
would happen to those hangmen
if they would be caught.

Letters To The Editor M

Commuter Asks Return . .

To ‘Equal Status Here

Editor, the Pitt News:

I wish to differ with you as to‘
the responsibilityfor the “apa-
thetic,” “indifferent,” -“contempt-
ously irresponsible” attitude, of
the “Weak Link”-——Pitt’s under-
classmen. This responsibility"
may lie not—with the students,
but with the university’s atti-
tude toward the students.

It is possible that those who .

guide the policies of the univers-
ity are desirous of change.
Would they make Pitt an ivy-
covered immitation of the
school they envy, with the entire
student body living on or near
the campus? Should the com-
muters be forced to other schools
where their presence is not re-
sented? I say no!

Many articles in university
publications-list the presence of
more non—local and out—of-state
students this trimester.

We are informed that more
and more students are living on

campus and’ that more on cam- /

pus housing is ‘being planned.
All this, of course, is good; but
what of the lowly commuters?
Is‘ he not left in the background
as Pitt’s lower class?
~ Why must we be the lower '

class? Are we less deserving? In
my ‘case'I spent four years in’the
U.S. Navy. After discharge I de-
cided upon college, choosi.ng,Pitt

‘ because I live nearby. I am not

eligible for G.I. beneﬁts; my
school expenses are paid from
personal savings.

Are there not many under-
classmen like me, if not vet-
erans, ‘than those whose parents
can afford only the costs of tui-
tion and books?

Why not then, make ours an_
institution that favors commu-
ters rather than one that re-
jects them? And commuters are
indeed rejected at Pitt. May I
remind you that we are “apa-
thetic,” “indifferent,” and “ir-
responsible.” ‘Since ‘on campus
students more often take part in
extra-curricular affairs, is your

  

     

thrust not aimed at we. commu-
ters? ' - ‘
Let me parry that thrust if I

may. Would you care to spend.

two hours a day travelling to
school and back, and then waste
two additional hours attending
one of Pitt’s social ‘events in-
teresting only to campus resi-
dents? *

T Would you care to relinquish a

-morning of sleep only to ﬁnd’
that our choncellor fails to men-'

tion such commuter problems as
student parking and‘8 a.m. to 6

pm‘. classes in -his convocation ,

address? Perhaps you would.

However, ‘the average commuter”

would likely stay at home.
Might this not explain the
lack of student interest in pro:
grams other than the—‘Midday
Series which is ‘A presented at a

’ convenient time? Commuters are

interested in the university, but
is the university -interested in
the commuters? ‘

Finally, let me say that if we

‘ commuters could organize, per-

haps we would run the. univers-
ity as you suggest. But because
of our diversiﬁed living condi-
tions organization -is very nearly
impossible. Therefore I entreat
that commuters be granted equal
status in university life, perhaps
then, the “sheer indifference,”
“contemptous i r r e sp 0 n s i b i-
lity” and “apathy” of the “Weak
Link” will disappear from Pitt.

University Can Give

Society Better Purpose

Editor, the Pitt News:
In the Monday, Oct. 19 edi-

tion of the Pitt News, three in-‘

teresting related articles appear-
ed: The chancellor’s “Reflec-
tions on a Changing Image.”
your. editorial and a letter from
Harvey Levine. '
Caustically, you remarked that
whereas the great medieval uni-
versities were organized and run
by the students, today we can-
not trust the student body with
the administration of our uni-

state exists because of the apa-
thy of our student body.

Yet Mr. Levine takes time to?

defend_the apathy of the student

,body, pointing out that _today’s

student is not at Pitt to become

a rabble-rouser, or radical; he is '

here to get an education. Inad-
vertently, Mr. Levine is_ telling

‘ you the same thing Dr. Litch-

K

ﬁeld is sayingin his address --
the “image is changing.”

_ Thus, your editorials must re-
main futile as long as you direct
them at theeffect of the “chang-
ing image” rather than the cause

of ._it. . . b
The very title of _Dr. Litch-

ﬁeld’s address implies that he
understands the historical inter-
pretation and function of a uni-
versity, but he
says, that though this was all
right ‘for the past the ‘jimage
must change.” I -

Today a university education .

must be carried out with the
ends of society in mind. No

patronizingly -

longer.is a university a v_olun- ‘

tary community of scholars
joined. andoperated by them to
promote the advancement of
knowledge and enlightened: self-
interest. 2
Today a university is an in-
strument of society which, is to
be employed in the furthejrence
of society’s ends. Dr. Litchﬁeld
recognizes this fact, and"? ap-
plaud it as a good change. Mr.
Levine, and no doubt most of
the student body see in "our uni-
versity a good (or bad) training

base for society’s positions and’

purposes.

Now, you and I know that the
best way for man to serve so-
ciety is not to better perform
society’s purpose, but rather to
give togsociety a better purpose.

In this day of swift international comnninications, like radio,
television, and the raft, it becomes more and more important
to be solidly grounded in foreign languages. Accordingly, I
have asked the makers of Philip Morris whether I might not
occasionally forego levity in this column and insteaduuse it for
a lesson in language. ’ ‘ ,

“Of course, silly!” chuckled the makers of Philip Morris,
tousling ‘my yellow locks. Oh, grand men they are, just as full
of natural goodness as the cigarettes they make, just as clean

"and fresh, just as friendly, just as agreeable to have along in
all times and clinics and places. “Of course, fond boy,” laughed
the makers and tossed me up and down in a blanket until, giddy
with giggling, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs until the
campﬁre had turned to embers. ' I

For our first lesson in language we will take up‘French. We
will approach French in the modern manner—ignoring the
tedious rules of grammar and concentrating instead on idiom.
After all, when we go to France, what does it matter if we can
parse and conjugate? What matters is that we should be able
to speak z'dioma.tz'c conversational French.

So, for the ﬁr§f exercise, translate the following real, truc-to-

.Iife dialogue between two real, true-to—life Frenchmen named
Claude (pronounced C'loh.d) and Pierre (also pronounced Clohd).

Cats Fail tio-“Score   TD;

By TED COLTON
, Johnny Michelosen’s Panthers were fresh out of fourth-
quarter comebacks Saturday as they went down to their see-

the Stadium before 27,397 rain-drenched fans.

The rains came in the fourth quarter and washed out the
Panthers’-hopes for another come-from-behind win as TCU

  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
 

with 10:51’ left in the ball game.

V ‘It was another game in which
the Cats were greatly handicap-
ped’ by fumbles? and intercepted
passes. They lost the ball twice on
fumbles and once on an intercept-
ed pass.

Seaman Scores

Taking the opening kickoff the
Cats appeared to be ﬁred up as
they .moved down to TCU’s 23-
yard line from where Norton Sea-
man kicked a ﬁeld goal. The olTi-
- cial distance was 40-yards. The
 big.’ play for the Cats on the ﬁrst
series of plays was a 55-yard
sprint around right end by Chuck
Reinhold on the second play from
scrimmage. ,
' TCU came right back and
drove 61 yards in 13 plays, scor-
.. ing on a one-yard plunge by

~‘ Eullback Jack Spikes. E. E.
Dodson kicked the extra point.
' That ended the scoring until the
I ﬁnal period when the Horned
Frogs added their insurance
touchdown as Marvin Lasater,
who had been running over the
Cats'all,day, scored from eight
yards out. A

Because of a wet-ﬁeld and great
pass defense there were. only four
passes completed by both sides.
TCU made one in 12 attempts

« Ivan Toncic completed all three
of the Cats’ passes for a total of

Texans. But the Panthers were
