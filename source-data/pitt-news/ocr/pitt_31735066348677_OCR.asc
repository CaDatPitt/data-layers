‘Sta rt—up'

4 BY BILLMOORE

Overwhelming response made the
first of two START-UP days a
‘surprising success, with many of
_\ t e letter-writing booths unableto
handle the large number . of

interested students.

START-UP day organizers said
the volume of letters written far
exceeded expectations, causing a
shortage of supplies and manpower
but making the campaign a
success. \

“The response was much more
than we could take - care’ of at
times,” said Student Government
(SG) Public Relations Chairperson
Kim Weyman. “Everything has
gone very well and we are very"
happy?’
iWeyman estimated upward of

{I-§,.;.K_2,500 letters would be written
 ’ during. the 2-day drive.

START-UP day was initiated by
leaders of the. three campus
‘student governments in hopes of
influencing state legislators to
increase the Pitt budget allocation
above the‘ ﬁgure‘ suggested __by
Governor Milton Shapp. Students
.. re being asked to contact ‘their

“"*'°" state senators and representatives
to call attention to the University’s
- /ﬁnancial dilemma.

Besides using the 12 letter-writing
booths scattered across campus,
students can contact state legisla-
tors ov'er« Student Government
WATS phone lines. ‘

Most key student organizations
are cooperating with START-UP

- day, as are Pitt administrators.

./_:_§é3~€hancellor'We,sley Posvar, along-
as

with other key ofﬁcials,
endorsed the drive, and his office
has helped with supplies _and
information.

Many students were unaware of
the situation before being ap-

proached_ by START-UP volun-’

teers, according to SG Allocations

Committee member Patti ‘Cooper,
, who'is manning one of the booths.

Tuition Hike:  

BY BILL MOORE

While START-UP day has student ’

energy focused on Harrisburg, the
implications of the budget situation

here on campus are becoming more
. evident. '

Both’ Chancellor Wesley Posvar
and. Budget and Planning ‘Vice-
Chancellor Jack Freeman ‘recently
have stated some rise in tuition is
almost inevitable.

Posvar said this'week a prelimi- A

nary decision probably will come
sometime in July. “It may take the
form oftwo increases, one in the
fall and possibly another for winter"
term,” he added. .

But the extent of the hike is still as
uncertain as ever. ‘

Without the much sought-after
increase in state appropriations,
Pitt will face a shortage near $9
million, Posvar said.

Programeicuts could take up $5

A million of the slack, but that ﬁgure

is extremely speculative. Posvar
and Freeman are still reviewing the
data.

The exact costof salary compen-
sation for University employees is a
third factor to be balanced before_
any ‘tuition increase ‘ﬁgure is

however. Using the rough ﬁgure
for \full-time students enrolled in
1974--20,000--it is easy to calculate

A that a $200 per year tuition hike

would be necessary to raise an
additional $4 million.
Tuition would need to be upped
$100 a year to raise $2 million.
Pitt’s shortage could easily fall
within that range. »
Freeman conﬁrmed the above
ﬁgures as accurate, but quickly
pointed out the large number of
variables involved.
“We” are not

.“We still need ﬁxes on program

yesterday. _ -
The remodeling of the 15-year-old

A store, which grew out of concerns

over incomplete customer ser/vice
and inefﬁcient use of shelf space,
will be ﬁnanced solely through
special plant funds earmarked for
the overhaul, according to Dutton.

“The money; has ‘been set aside

we’ve deferred some maintenance

Dutton ‘explained although the

Dr. Arcadi Nebolsine, professor of

reported this. Everybody was, for
the most part, very good about the
whole thing. Nobody tried to make
a big deal out of it.”

Tastemaster Bakery, of McKees-
port, reportedly received other
complaints from area food services.

Dearden said the "University has
dealt with this company for almost
14 years without any problems.
“This glass business hasn’t ever
happened to us before.”

The bakery was very apologetic,
Dearden said. “The owner, Bert
Klein, has just been great about
this. 4 He said to refer all complaints
to him, and he'd take care of
them.”

Tuck Shop evening manager Bill
Flanagan said the buns were taken
off the shelves and re-boxed. '
“We’re gonna send the buns back
to the bakery.

They said they’ll pick them up in
the morning. About .25-30 dozen
have to be replaced, plus the ones
we threw away.”

Flanagan said he had heard of
other complaints involving the
bakery’s shipment. “This hap-
pened all over the place, not just at
the Tuck Shop. I guess the guys
dropped the buns around town, and
the same thing happened.”

Dearden and Flanagan said they
asked two of the students to go to
Presbyterian Hospital as a precau-
tion. The other students were able
to pick out the glass pieces before
they were swallowed. Two
students were upset by the incident
and reportedly were considering
seeking damages from the bakery.

BY VALERIE STRUBLE
The Boston school integration
movement and the May 17

demonstration against racism in
Boston will be the topics at a
program for the late Dr. Martin
Luther King sponsored by the
Pittsburgh NAACP Friday night.

Boston NAACP President Thomas
Atkins will be the main speaker at
the program to be held in St.‘
Brigid-St. Benedict the Moor
Church at the corner of Centre and
Crawford Streets at 7:30 pm.

“Mr. Atkins is probably the
foremost expert on Boston’s
integration attempt, and his speech
will have great significance for
people against racism in Boston,
Pittsburgh and nationally,” said
Socialist Worker Party candidate
for city council Paul LeBlanc.

The Boston School District was
found guilty by Federal District
Judge W. Arthur Garrity of
violating segregation laws in the
Morgan _vs Hennigan case last
June. When desegregation plans
went into effect in September,
opposition was widespread and
violent. Black students were
injured by angry white parents,
and fights between blacks and
whites closed several _Boston
schools.

Atkins responded by organizing a
national student conference in
February. The conference set up a

To dispel predictions of doom, and more important, to work as

‘ efﬁciently as possible in solving Pitt’s ﬁnancial crisis, the Student
Government Board (SGB) has openly called upon the administration to ~

The level-one is the most detailed of the three budgets compiled by
the University, and contains, among other items, the ﬁgures for
 ‘individual salaries and expense accounts. -

_ 4 P But according to Budget and Planning Vice-Chancellor Jack Freeman,

Possible landmark case

BY TOM WASELESKI

The Supreme Court‘ soon may
hand down a landmark decision
concerning the First Amendment,
but the media are_,gi‘ving the case
little coverage. .

-Victor Marchetti and John D.

Marks, authors of The CIA and the '

Cult of Intelligence, have asked the

‘ court to overturn an Appeals Court

ruling that permitted government
censorship of their book.

Marchetti began writing the book
when he left the Central Intelli-
gence Agency in 1969. The CIA
then went to court with an
employment contract Marchetti
had signed when he began working
for the agency, pledging himself to

-secrecy on CIA matters.

A temporary injunction forced
Marchetti and Marks to submit
their book to the CIA for editing.
The agency deleted 339 portions of
the manuscript, but talks with the
authors reduced the number of
deletions to 168.

Marchetti and Marks nevertheless
ﬁled suit to have the deletions set
aside. '

The first ruling supported the
authors, but a higher court
overturned it without hearing any

  Letters to the Editor

Rouen. Program
Held jsqs Benefit

To the Editor:

As a former participant in the -

University of Pittsburgh's program
in Rouen, I am appalled at the

University’s decision to cancel this,

worthwhile program.- FAS Dean
Rosenberg was quoted as saying
the program _was dropped because
the University could not afford to
keep it in ‘operation, and besides,
“it _i_sn’t central to the French
Department's main mission.” He
never deﬁnes the content of this
“mission," but I have ‘always
believed" that one major aim of the
French Department is to immerse
the French major _totally and
completely into the culture of
France. Although it is true that one
can attain an adequate knowledge
of French history, culture, litera-
ture, and grammar through the
resources of this University, one
must live in France to truly achieve
a proper knowledge of the,French
people‘ and their way of life.

_, As to the ﬁnancial aspects of the
program, it does not appear to me
from this article in the Pitt’News of
March 24 that the program lost
money for the University. It was
not one of Pitt’s largest money-
making endeavors either. I was
never under the impression that
the Rouen program was out to reap
a profit, because the cost of the
-program to the ‘student is low,
when one considers the expenses
incurred in attending a ' private
university for a semester. Other
than the $160 " program fee and
the $15 application fee, the
student pays the normal tuition and
dormitory expenses for the semes-
ter. His or her only other expenses
are transportation and spending
money,/ which he or she would

incur on any journey abroad. The ’

‘total cost for one semester is in the
neighborhood of $2,000, which is

cheaper than attending CMU or’

‘ Duquesne for one semester while

‘ living on campus.

The learning experience one gains
in -a-program such_ as the Rouen
Ito’ -:,t.h.ef. s-tuden"=t,

 
    
 

  Ar}

witnesses. The case is now before
the highest court in the land.

Meanwhile, the book is being sold
with -168 blank spaces representing
the deleted material.

The question of signing a contract
like the one the CIA had Marchetti
sign, which automatically nulliﬁes
one‘s civil right to the truth, is out
of keeping with the form of
government we profess to uphold.
Similarly restricting one’s freedom
are contracts required by various
corporations and labor unions that
bind employees to allegiance to the
American government. This not
only prevents citizens from taking

action against a possible dictator-,

ship, but also deprives them of the
basic right to dissent.

These points no doubt will arise in
the‘Supreme Court’s deliberations.
Couplediwith the basic questidn of

, government secrecy for the sake of

national security, they will guar-
antee the case’s significance for
future reference.

A decision upholding the ClA’s
claim to tight secrecy regarding its
operations will undoubtedly en-
courage the government to classify
information more readily, especi-
ally since the procedure, for

both academically and culturally.

Not only will the loss of this

program be a detriment to French
majors at Pitt, but to the University
as a whole, and also to those many
students from other universities
who wish to participate in Pitt’s
program. Since Pitt’s program is
fully accredited by‘ any major
university, and since ‘students have
the “option of studying in France for

one semester,‘ thus reducing»

expenses somewhat (most junior
year programs are for the full
year), it has attracted students
from numerous major universities.

My group consisted of students
from UCLA, University of Virginia,
University of Massachusetts, Drew
University, Bucknell University
and St. Frahcis, among others.

I am certain that other students
who ‘have participated
program will attest to the beneﬁts
thereof. I feel that the cancellation
of this program is unnecessary, as
the loss to the University in the
cultural realm would more than
offset the relatively low ﬁnancial
gain which the‘University would
incur as a result; _ . ,

On: ESC Event
Dear Editor:

On behalf of the Engineering
Student Cabinet, I would like to

thank the Pitt News for their “60

Years of Collegiate Journalism,"

For the past year and a half, we
have been working on Engineers’
Week 1975--one of the major
events on the Pitt Campus every
year for the past twenty-one years.

We sponsored a parade with 100%
participation from the engineering
departments, a soap box derby
with 15 entries, a service project for
the Western Pennsylvania,Leuke-
mia Society. and the 1975
Shamrock Ball", and the only

coverage we get from the Pitt News '

is, one 200-word article on March

-I personally met with

classiﬁcation is not based on
deﬁnitive regulations, but rather
on a series of executive orders. '
Such a decision also will permit the
signing away of ‘basic rights,
despite all the laws currently on the
books guarding against‘ p0litic,§_l,..-“‘G"'K"’“”""'
discrimination.

i

On the other hand, a ruling 
sympathetic to Marchetti and
Marks will place the secret

operations of the CIA under further
scrutiny, motivating other CIA
malcontents to print their exposes. i

Though the chances are extremely
slim in light of cold war tensions, a

decision against the covertness of ii‘
the CIA may in the long run end the i
secret surveillance of foreign __
countries. Such a move would put 
policies - overseas in a more -'3'

positive, constructive light. It '
would compel governments‘ to deal
openly with each other andwithout
mutual suspicion. ii *  »...;l

The new perils erupting daily i
throughout the world ,_ seem to
indicate this type of thinking is i
premature. But in light of the poor
position in which the CIA now ﬁnds ,;
itself because of various excesses,

‘the time appears ideal for a court

decision that would drastically
overhaul, the agency's duties.

proclaim on the front page of that
issue that the Pitt News was tinted
green in honor of ' the Saint_
Patrick's Day, when in truth the
Engineering Student Cabinet paid
for that green ink, to celebrate the
opening of Engineers’ Week» 1975.

Features Editor, Rita Vitolo, one
week before Engineers’ Week, and
presented her, with a complete
schedule and description of the
upcoming activities. In spite of
this, not .one single picture or
follow-up story appeared in the Pitt
News. You had more than enough
space for‘ the Greek . Week
activities, and provided complete
coverage of. the Black Action

If the Pittsburgh Press, and the

enough _of Engineers’ Week to

‘Don't despair! You have no form of VD.
Crabs are a variety of lice, plain old-fashioned '
Ilice that your mother always warned you

‘Crab lice, a distinct species of lice, have a
very broad, short body with long, ‘clawed

legs, resembling the general appearance of

a tiny crab, from which it derives its name.
hey are grayish in color with slightly reddish
legsbut usually look brown over all.
‘"Crabs_can be picked up in numerous circum-

’ _ stances—during intercourse, sitting on a toilet

_.The danger is that the female crab produces
' 25 or more eggs at once and glues them, one

..;_.ata time, to the course hairs among which
they live. A number of eggs may be glued to
'”a single hair and often some distance from

the skin. . V
The itching from the crabs is due to their

' ing off the Cathedral, don't feel so bad:

   
  
  
   
   
  
 
  
 
   
 

 

    

you're not alone. You've got company, and
lots of it. Really, what else can you expect
when you've been chasing grades, among
other delicacies, since September? How else
can you feel when every time you try to get
out for your 9 o'clock class you find yourself
walking through a sleet storm in the middle

of what looks and feels like night?
Although each of us has his and her own

I special bummer, depression always means

trouble. If you've ever been depressed (and
chances are you have) you know exactly how

V it feels. My roommate, for example, sleeps

eleven hours at a shot. My‘next-door neigh-
bor refuses to wash. My girl won't shave her
moustache. Some people eat, while others, if
their transmissions were dropped ‘in’ back-
wards, don't eat! Whatever it is, it's not
pleasant. , g .

Luckily, there's help. Depression is a legiti-
mate problem and if you know who to talk
to, you're on your way out of it. Depression;
has causes, symptoms, and even, at times, its
own cycle. It can also involve a combination of
problems. For example, it can make you irrit-
able, nervous, and hostile. It can make you an

' insomniac, give you constipation, or take

away your appetite. Or, like my roommate,

it can take your energy ‘away and make you
want to do nothing but sleep. V

No matter how you react to_ depression, one
thing  certain: you feel as if you aren't worth
two cents. Depression spells gloom, a sense

of worthlessness, a feelingithat there isn't any

hope, and even fear. And always,‘your body
gangs up on you and hits you in‘the gut."

, So what can you do when you begin to

measure bumper heights on parked cars and
discover in yourself a fascination for high
places? There’splenty you can do. One is
change your routine.‘ Take a fast walk after
supper, plan two-minute exercise breaks

- throughout the day, or eat a meal at a differ-

ent hour. -But change that routine. Two, talk
to a friend. Three, talk some more. The best

\ thing you can-do i_s find, make, but, or steal

a friend who'll listen to you and help you get
yourself together. Four, watch your diet. Bad
food when you're depressed can put you
further in the hole. Five, if none of these
seem to work, there arecampus organizations
to help you. For an understanding ear from
a fellow student, call "A Little Help from
Your Friends," at 624-5966., You may seek .
professional help from Psycologists at the

' University Counseling Center or obtain

psychiatric care at the Student Health Center.
Finally, if all else fails, get a new roommate!

. THE COMMON COLD

You have a runny nose, you're sneezing, you
have a sore throat, a dry cough, hoarseness, or
all of the above. You know you have a cold.
And you have plenty of company, the common
oold is mankind's most widespread illness.

How did you catch your cold?-You caught it
from someone e|se——whether you were shaking
hands/or giving a goodnight kiss. Getting chilled
or wet probably had little‘ to do with you
catching your cold. It's people, and not Old
Man Winter that's keeping this cold bug going.

,pﬁ-"xix":
/*1 ,-

The culprit isn't a bug actually. it's a virus.
There are manyfdifferent virsuses and many
di’fferent_kinds of colds and flu. The virus has
the delightful ability to change its structures-
that’s how we get the Asian Flu, the Hong Kong
Flu, and the "new"strain that is always going
around. V ' ‘ ‘

So, what can you do about your edition of
the common cold? It has been said that a cold '
that is treated will last 10 days—untreated it
will still last 10'days! There isn't much that
can be done medically. The best thing to do
for a cold is to do what they say on TV: Get
plenty of rest (number one); drink plenty of
|iquids,gargle with warm saltwater for a

sore throatjand take asprin if you like. If
you're giving your cold to Contac—these pills
or capsules may relieve your uncomfortable
symptoms. But remember, most cold tablets
contain antihistamine, and they may make
you drowsy or sleepy. So never drive after
taking an antihistamine ofdecongestant un-
less you know how it's young to hit you.

If your-fever keeps coming back or lasts for -T 
more than a day or two, if you have pain ’
just above or below the eyes, if yellowish or

greenish mucus is coming from your lungs, if

1 you have chest pain, or if your cold symptoms

last longerthan a week, complications may
be present. So call your doctor or the Health
Service. ‘ V

If a high fever comes on suddenly, you feel

Great Arias from Great Italian

‘BY PAMELA EUSI

Anna Moffo, in her recording of
Great Arias from Great Italian
Operas, is more than incompar-
able, she is divine. The arias

-chosen for the album perfectly

demonstrate her versatility in the
operatic world. The selections also
run the gamutof famous roles--

Nilsson, whose broad vowels and
legato tones lean toward a more
austere Tosca. But Moffo does not
lend herself to the overly emo-
tional, lengthy fermatas of final
notes‘-the way Nilsson does.

A lovely aria from Leoncavallo’s I
Pagliacci pictures Nedda imitating
a flock of birds and envying them in
their freedom. Moffo sings this
with a" poignancy that is deeply
touching, yet inauspicious. As
Angelica from Puccini’s Suor
Angelica, she lets sadness reign in
a moving aria to her dead child.

The second side begins with the
role of Semiramide, by Rossini.
Anticipation is the major motif in
this aria, as Semiramide is waiting
for her lover. Next two arias from
Turandot by Puccini depict Liu’s
great love for Calaf in moments of
legato lines and tremendous builds
on individual words.

Moffo’s character of Lucia from
Lucia di Lammermoor is unques-

tionably the best selection of the,

album. The gorgeous high notes
complement her dramatic effects
and lend easily to the ominous tone
of Regnava nel Silenzio. Corinna

difficult to distinguish between
them (also adding to the confusion

the purer, idealistic Lucia.

with a perfect vibrato. Sills’ clarity
and brightness ring on a constant
level, which makes up for her lack
of dramatics. It is notdifﬁcult at all
to tell the difference between Sills
and Patricia Kern as Alis_a.
Regardless, Moffo’s dramatic
qualities are not meant to be tossed
aside; they are essential to her
sense of style.

BY DOUG GEBHARD,

There are many albums that
should be reviewed this time, but
I’ve chosen strong ones to
comment on...some artists have
missed the boat with these latest
releases and others-have outdone

themselves. In‘a concise and exact

way_...that’s what this is about. A
quick look and speculation. Here it
goes: ' '
Keith & Donna. Keith and Donna
Godchaux,' V Round Records A [RX

we need it? This album’s only
redeeming qualities are Garcia’s
guitar solos. The vocals of the

Godchaux’s are certainly nothing to A

write home about.

Ever since their appearance into
the Dead, the music of the Dead
has been getting more 1aid‘back.
Keith’s acoustic piano is mediocre
neo-rock’n’roll and Gospel...some-
thing that could never ‘replace

This album- is hardly worth the
plastic and paper it took to make it.

is the underlying thought that I

  Ridl Resigns.    All-lead   Couch .

BY RICK ST OUFFER ‘
Sports Editor

Charles “Buzz" Ridl announced
yesterday at a special news confer-
ence he would step down as Head
Basketball Coach at Pitt, effective

5 :";,.hily 1. Athletic Director Casimir
. Myslinski announced

Assist ant

Coach Tim ‘Grgurich would take
over. ,.

“I have met with the team as a
whole and told them’I would be
‘stepping down,” said a smiling,
yet_ subdued Ridl. “I’ve done
research on the idea the past two
years and feel now would be the
best time to make the move. It is a
pleasant time and there are no
bitter feelings between anyone,
and it’s proper for the future.”

Ridl came to Pitt in March, 1968 ‘

and was expected to perform
miracles immediately.. As head

'Kcoach of little’ Westminster College
- " Tn Eastern Pennsylvania, Ridl had.

compiled a record of 216 wins and
90 losses in a 12-year span, ‘a .704

~ winning percentage.

_ His teams took seven-West Penn
Conference championships in nine
years, and made six appearances in
the NAIA tournament. His 1962
squad was voted by both wire
services as the number-one small
college in the nation. Ridl was
voted Coach of the Year.

Such fantastic feats, however,

task with any kind of talent--and
Buzz had very little. The first
seasonended with four wins and 20
losses, but change was in the air.
With the difficult ﬁrst year under
his belt, Ridl instilled in his
assistants Fran Webster and Tim
Grgurich the determination to
make things work. And things got
better.

Year number two ended at the
.500 mark, with a win in the old
West Virginia Field House makin
the season. \

“When I started at Pitt some
people said it was a “Mission
Impossible,” Ridl said. ‘‘I know it
would take a lot of work to turn the

program around, but I feel l’ve-
,reached my

goals in seven
years.”

..Last‘year was indeed a fulﬁllment
of Ridl’s goal, as the Panthers went
25-4 for the season and post-
season, losing the NCAA Eastern
ﬁnal to the eventual champion,
North Carolina State.

“Last year I thought perhaps
would be my final year, ” Ridl said.
“But then I saw how tough this
year would be with a new_ group of
players and a difficult schedule,

and I wanted to see what we could "

do and how. things would turn out.”

This year the Panthers started out
slowly, as Ridl had expected, but
gradually came around and entered

a tournament for the second year in .

people speak of Pittsburgh basket-

said. “I was at the NCAA ﬁnals,
‘and from talking to different
coaches_they all have a new respect
for Pitt. lthink we could have been
in the ﬁnals with just a little luck.

We can play that caliber of ball.”'

Myslinski wasted little time in
announcing Assistant Coach Tim
Grgurich as the new head man.

“Tim has helped largely in our

_ success the past years under Coach

Ridl, and with, him as head coach

we expect to continue our growth.-

He’s done a great job as a

the team. Tim is young, able and
should do an outstanding job.” A

Rangers  May Surprise Oakland

(Continued from Page 9)

Tenace or Joe Rudi at first. Second
base is open to Phil Garner, Ted

' Kubiak or Dick Green.

Any team that can afford to put a
fine fielder like Rudi at first base
must have an excellent outfield. .
Oakland has a great one in Reggie
Jackson, Bill North and Claudell
Washington, who could replace
Rudi in left.

Not everything went poorly for the
A’s in the off-season. They picked

up Billy Williams from the Cubs, I

and though he might be too old to
play the field, his presence as a
designated hitter should mean a lot
to the A’s.

2. TEXAS RANGERS--Only last

-year, the Rangers were a 100-1 shot

to win the division. They surprised
everyone by copping second place.

Because of last season’s perfor-
mance and Oakland’s loss of
Hunter, many pick the Rangers to
win the division. But lack of depth
and good starters will cause the
Rangers to fall short.

Ferguson Jenkins, coming off a
fantastic 25-12 season, will have to
equal it if the Rangers hope to
topple Oakland. Steve Hargan,
Jackie Brown, Jim Bibby and Clyde
Wright are all vulnerable pitchers.
Bibby won 19 games for the
Rangers last season but also lost

19. Wright went 9-20 with the

Brewers and Hargan and Brown
pitched barely over .500.

Outside of pitching, the Rangers
are solid. Jeff Burroughs, the
American League MVP, is ex-
pected to at least equal his
performance of last season, which
included a .301 batting average, 25
home runs and 118 RBIs. The
acquisition of Willie Davis bolsters
the outfield tremendously. Davis,
Burroughs and Cesar Tovar will
make up a highly ‘effective outﬁeld,
both defensively and offensively.

Not only did the Rangers have the
American League MVP last season,
but they also had the Rookie of the
Year in first baseman Mike
Hargrove (.323 batting average, 4
home runs, 66 RBIs). Hargrove,
Dave Nelson, Toby Harrah and Len

inﬁeld that combines ﬁnedefense
with good hitting.

If for any reason the Oakland A’s
falter, be assured Texas will be
there to pick up the pieces.

3. MINNESOTA TWINS--The
Twins ﬂoundered through much of
last season and have made no
changes, except for dumping

. Harmon Killebrew.

Minnesota pitching, however,
could be very tough. Bert Blylevn
is thought to have the best
curveball in the game, and Joe
Decker and Dave Goltz could be
reliable starters. Decker had a

' 16-14 record last season with a

more than respectable 3.29 ERA.
Goltz had a 3.36 ERA last season as
a rookie and will probably improve.

' The Twins should have a solid

inﬁeld, with Craig Cusick at first,
Danny Thompson at shortstop, Eric
Soderholm or Steve Braun at third
and the perennial American
League batting champ Rod Carew,
who won his fourth title last
season, at second.

Bobby Darwin, Larry Hisle and
Steve Brye make up the adequate
outfield. The left-center power
alley in the Minnesota park has
been moved in by fifteen feet.
Hisle and Darwin may take
advantage of the move.

4. KANSAS CITY--The Royals
were doing well for most of last
season, but then the roof fell in.
John Mayberry was a disappoint-
ment, as were Paul Splittorf and
Amos Otis.

The only bright spots at the end of
the season were Steve Busby and
Hal McCrae. Busby was 22-14 with
a_ 3.39 ERA, while McRae had a
splendid year as designated hitter
with a .310 average, 15 home runs
and 88 RBIs.

The Royals could unseat Minne-
sota and take third place, but good
pitching will be needed from more
than just Busby. Hitting will be
expected from Mayberry and Otis.

,5. CHICAGO WHITE SOX--Chuck
Tanner will be back this season,
but Dick Allen won’t, although
many Chicago fans feel Tanner
should have left, too. -

,Tanner will have to make some
changes this year. One of them will

be to decrease the number of

games Wilbur Wood pitches. ,
(Wood had 24-20 and 20-19 records
in his last two seasons). If a pitcher
loses almost as many as he
wins--and he is the club ace--the
team is in deep trouble.

6. CALIFORNIA ANGELS--Dick
Williams must yearn for the days
when he was a winnerand a widely
acclaimedgenius. Genius can go

L. only so far, especially if the
I .- material is lacking.

The Angels will have to depend on
“ a lot more than Nolan Ryan to drag

them out of the pits they belong in.

Ryan will probably pitch another
no-hitter this year; but his team
will remain in last place. Unless

3 some drastic personnel changes are
i made on_the Angels’ team, it will
_ stay in last place for a long time to
' come. a

Tennis Opens Season
  an Winning Valle y

BY JIM SPAN OS

The Pitt men's tennis team
opened its "1975 campaign with an
easy 8-1 win over Grove City
Wednesday. The Panthers won ﬁve
of six singles matches, with wins by
Joe Kantor, Tom Curent, George
Dieffenbach, Mike Habbel and
Harry Habbel. In the sixth singles

’ match, Grove City’s Doug Zellers

defeated Pitt’s Dave Wulkan 1-6,
6-3, 6-0.

In the doubles matches the Cats’

‘record was equally impressive as

they won all three matches.

“We’re going to have just abou
the same type of team as we did
last year,” said coach Fran Web-
ster. “Our top four men all

,-,. eturned from last year, and our

/men in the ﬁfth and sixth position

. could be moved out or they could

Grove City, but Dave '(Wulkan) 4

into the starting lineup.”

The results:

_ Tracksters Off
And Running
At Kent State

The Pitt Tracksters, after a short
rest between seasons, embark on
the outdoor campaign today as they
visit Kent State University for the
newly-formed Ohio Relays.

The schools competing are teams
from the Mid-American Confer-
ence, Ohio independents, and
small colleges from Pennsylvania
and West Virginia. '

Pitt will concentrate mainly on its

relay teams, with three groups_

running Friday and Saturday.

In the four-mile relay, Rich
“Sparkle” Markley will lead off the
chase, followed by freshman whiz
Mel Boyd, Dave McDonald and
ﬁnally Nick Martin in his first race

of the year. Martin is coming off a '

bad leg injury, but has looked
excellent in practice.

The distance-medley relay will
feature Chuck Mozingo, Lee Car-
ter, Markley‘ and McDonald, and
the two-mile willhave Nick Martin,

Don Betterley, Mozingo, and, once.

again, “Sparkle. ”

emotional Grgurich. “It may sound
dumb. but everything l’ve learned
about basketball the past seven
years has come from Buzz Ridl.
“Our program will continue to
excel, with everyone working on
fundamentals harder than before,”
Grgurich continued. “There will be *
changes in style as there are with

Grgurich will rely on three assis- ator

tants. Fran Webster again will be
in charge of the defense. It was he
who started the amoeba in 1969. A
person to be named later will be in‘
charge of recruiting. Pitt’s out-
standing guard this past season,
Kirk Bruce, will stay on "after
graduation as an assistant.

“I’ve talked to Kirk already about’
the positionand he has agreed to
take it. The only stipulation is if he
is drafted by the pros, he will
naturally not coach; but the job is 4
his until he tells me otherwise,”
Grgurich said. '

Bruce will be an all-round coach

AIIGTION Persian Bugs & Other Uiiental Rugs

at SHERATON MOTOR INN-SOUTH, US 19 at Ft. Couch Rd., Pittsburgh, Pa.
FRIDAY, APRIL .4, 8 pm-Viewing at 7 pm

F Iranian Rugs, so called Persian carpets, today are in big demand and much desired by interior decora-
, . tors and are getting rarer every day. There is no doubt these beautiful rugs will be impossible to

- find later on.

' The weavers of these rugs, who created these pieces of beautiful craftsmanship, earned the lowest
wage in the world, as low as 75 cents a day. With the rapid economicgrnwth, the Iranian government

. prohibited such low salary scales, and their average income now is unbelievable as compared with the

I past. If the weavers whould make rugs today the cost would be several times higher than 5 years.

~ Note about this auction: The goods have been stored for a long period for non-payment and the insol-
vent company under pressure from creditors has offered to dispose the entire collection to highest
bidder in single units.

This is a religious precept that
challenges the mind. Love my en-
emy when I can barely deal calmly
with my in—laws? Yet this hard‘say—
ing has validity in a world where
even a small act of violence has
such unforeseeable repercussions.
Scientific advances have heighten-
ed our mutual vulnerability. Only
love and non-violence can sustain
us. We may concede violence is in
all of us. So is God. Try His way.
It works. Get together with your
family, friends, neighbors, or co-
workers to discuss the.problems of
violence and how you can work to-
gether to help solve them. For a
helpful discussion guide and fur-
ther information write: Religion In
American Life, 475 Fifth Ave., New ,
