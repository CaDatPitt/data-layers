Rojas To Describe Plight C0—0l3A1‘r’c111g€m€11l

Al Rojas, the Pittsburgh or-
ganizer of the Grape Boycott,
will be the featured speaker at
the Public Affairs Film Ser-
ies presentation of Decisions
at Delano and Harvest of
Shame next Monday in the S.
U. Ballroom at 7 p.m. Rojas
is the local representative of
the United Farm Workers Or-
ganizing Committee, (UFWOC ),
begun in 1965 by non-violent
leader Cesar Chavez.

In addition to discussing
the films and the international
boycott against California
table grapes, Rojas will de-
scribe the plight of the farm
laborer. His insight comes from
his own experience as one of
hundreds of thousands of Mex-
ican-American farm work-
ers.

Grape-pickers, like all farm
workers, are among the poor-
est paid of all unskilled lab-
orers in the country. In ad-
dition, they are partly ex-

cluded from a number of _rou- -

tine benefits afforded laborers,
such as unemployment insur-
ance, workmen’s compensa-
tion, social security, welfare
assistance, and minimum wage
standards.

Rally Criticizes Society’s Wrongs  

by ANNE DORN
Staff News Writer
The moderator of the first an-
nual University May Day ral-
ly sounded like a carnival bark-
er as he announced the begin-
ning of the rally to the public
through the microphone on the
Cathedral lawn.

But what was said at the rally
proved to be far more serious
than carnival activities. Modera-
tor Joseph White, history Instruc-
tor, told the scattered audience
of about 175 that the real pur-
pose of a May Day rally was to
call attention to wrongs in the so-
ciety and call for “progressive
social change.” He criticized
the way May Day is usually rec-
ognized — with “celebration of the
American way of life . . . and a
recourse to platitudes."

The first speaker was Wolf
Swoboda from the department of
history. He elaborated on the idea
that May Day has become “Loy-
alty day” and a day for a "positive
display of American patriotism.”
Rather, he stated “we should
have a reevaluation of our pos-
tion in society and a reevalua-
tion of the reason for May Day.”

“The haves and the have-nots
are still with us,” he continued,
and the Establishment is still
with us. There is yet a need for
a demonstration against the anar-
chic use of that power.”

He noted that both the demon-
strations in The Soviet Union
and in Pittsburgh are somewhat
similar. The parades in Russia

. have shown examples of their ar-
maments. while in Pittsburgh this
year “84 units of four divisions”
marched down the streets.

Swoboda explained that there
has been "division in progres-
sive change." He said that there
is a "selfishness” that both the in-
tellectual and the economic pro-
gressives have which causes isola-
tion ‘and alienation from each

, other.

 

 
 
  
   

  
  

the national rate of on-the-job
accidents. Workers are cons-
tantly exposed to lethal pesti-
cides, disease, and unsanitary
working conditions. Migatory
farm workers are the most af-
flicted. Their life expectancy

’ is 49 years.

The UFWOC resorted to the
consumer boycott in a last -
ditch response to illegal grow-
er efforts to destroy the union.
Among" their tactics was the
exchange of trade labels among
growers to save one grower
from the effects of an earlier
boycott against him.

The growers initially impor-
ted illegal Mexican laborer to
try to break the strike. When
this failed, they formed a “com-
pany - union” called the Agri-
cultural Freedom to Work

Association, (AFWA) It is con-
trolled by the growers.

Confessions by some AFWA
leaders concerning the illegal
strike-breaking union led
to a full-scale U.S. Labor De-
partment investigation of its
activities. The findings of
this investigation prompted
a $10 million suit by UFWOC
against the growers and AFWA
for damages in violation of
federal labor laws.

To dramatize the importance
of the Grape Boycott, an inter-
national day of protest has been
scheduled in every major U.S.
city for Saturday, May 10th.

The protest will include non-
violent demonstrations and citi-

zen contacts with their local
store managers. They will ask
their grocers not tosell “scab”
grapes. -

Students here will finally be able to buy their books under a co-oj  I
arrangement, beginning July 1 of this year. Under the new set-up. any  .

 

profit at the end of the year would be reserved and paid as adividenda , -
an appropriate percentage of each individual’s purchases as evidence(  

by sales slips.

The dividends will be paid only
to University faculty, staff, and
students. Because of the profit-
sharing aspect, students, faculty,
and administration will share in
the management responsibility.
Three students, three faculty (rec-
ommended by the Faculty Senate),
and three faculty or administra-
tors appointed by the Chancellor
will serve on the Board of Direc-
tors. -

The University administration
will have veto power. “I do not ex-

pect to use that power,” said Edi- '

son Montgomery, vice-chancellor
of finance.

Two of the three students have
already been appointed by Student
Government President Scott
Baum. They are Anne Dorn, sen-
ior. and Cyndi Niklas, also a sen-

claimed that the board would be
charged with the responsibility of

of making the operation financial-J.

dividends. At the same time, it‘-
would aim atoperating under po-E

front other sectors of society.”
he emphasized.

Two “militant” representatives
from the unions were also at the
rally to urge the mainly student
audience to action for change. Jos-
eph Yablonski, who is on the in-
ternational Executive Board of
United Mine Workers, reviewed
the history of May Day. He stated
that it is “labor’s day to take stock
on what is accomplished and what
is yet to be done in the interest of

a terrible price in the future.”
Tom Quinn from the United
Electrical Radio and Machine
Workers of America presented
statistics which showed that the
average factory worker “can’t

‘make it on the 40 hour work week.”

The worker’s median income, he
stated, is $8,000 gross, while the
national statistics recommend
that $10,150 is a “good income.”
He placed most of the blame
for this drop in standard on the
war in Vietnam. “Vietnam has

He proposed two basic steps
the administration must take to
further progressive change in

society: 1) the end of the "mad ‘

race of stocking armaments to
eliminate mankind, and 2) the
withdrawal from Vietnam.

He wholeheartedly supported
militant means by students to
achieve progress in social change.
“I know the SDS is villified as

achieved in the world without

standards of all who work for a
living.” He went on to say that
the declining standards of living
since the war are due to the
“rising federal taxes and rising
prices.”

Quinn cited the Wall Street
Journal to prove his point about
rising prices. The Journal claim--
ed that the American factory
produces more profits today due

— to the “ease with which manu-

facturers have been able to raise

 
   
 
   
    
  

 

the war to “stop corporate profi-
teering.”

He urged students to “get mili-
tant; we’ll worry about discipline
later.” ‘

Gabriel Tortella from the His-
tory Department traced the his-
tory of the Spanish workers’
plight during the past 30 or 40
years, and implied a comparison
between their movement and
the movement in the- United Sta-
tes. ‘He explained that fascism

in Spain was a “definite'reac- -
tion of the bourgoisie against the,

workers and radicals.”

Tortella, who had done re-
search in this time period in Spain,

.continued to say that the group

against the workers employed
Ku Klux Klan methods to stir up
the workers. which in turn result-

ed in a fascist military interven— _

tion “in favor of law and order.”

In present day Spain, the Span-
ish working class is exploited by
the capitalists, and economic de-

velopment is taking place at the -

expense of the workers,” said Tor-
tella. “The spanish workers want
freedom to organize unions but
they can’t defeat the army. There
is naked repression and exploi-
tation in Spain, a situation which
is similar with variations all
over the world.”

Another union, the United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee,
was represented at the rally by
Al Rojas, of -“Boycott Califor-
nia Grapes” fame. He was ve-
hement in his criticism of stu-
dents who let themselves be mani-
pulated by the corporationsl“who
poison people”

He said that" students are just I

as guilty if they are not aware
of the situation of the minori-
ties or if they fail to speak out
against the injustices the minor-
ities are facing today. Students
must realize that “the minori-
ties can’t wait any more.” He

The Pittsburgh Council on
Higher Education (PCHE),
representing Carnegie-Mellon
University, Chatham College,
Duquesne University, Mount
Mercy College and the Univer-
sity, has sent a letter to legis-
lative leaders expressing con-
cern over pending legislation
concerning the system of state
scholarships.

The letter emphasized that
many students need “addition-
al financial help” to complete
their education, and urged the

present scholarship program.
The letter also deplored the

name of free speech, Central
Printing and the powers behind it
was spurred by the irrational over
reaction of the “people on this
campus.”

“An arguement has to be put for-
ward on a rational basis,” Holecko
insisted. “The obscenity thing was
totally irrational, based on the be-
lief that a word is inherently
wrong.”

The greatest danger in the con-
troversy was not the “administra-
tion’s opinion,” but the severe dis-
ciplinary measures it was intend-
ing to impose.

While many on this campus con-
sider the lessening of the distri-
bution requirements a great vic-
tory, the student representative
to the UC pointed out that nothing
was basically changed. He mused
over a year’s efforts and pinpoint-
ed most of the problems in the
“avuncular manner” of the facul-
ty.

“We came up against a lot of
sophistry and repetition,” be eval-
uated. “Attitudes have not changed
at this University because the fac-
ulty sees themselves as having the
ultimate power. None of the re-
forms basically challenge their
domination in the academic
realm.”

dents will realize their incompe-
tence,” continued Holecko, “and
will begin dictating to them.”

plan to change the program into
a system of loans, rather than
grants.

‘The letter also noted that the
colleges and universities can-
not make up for this proposed
change because “any uncom-
mitted funds must be used for
faculty salaries and. other ex-
penses.

There are about five thousand
students in Pittsburgh’s four

universities who are currently
receiving financial aid, and the
PCHE feels that the state has
a commitment to them.

When asked to comment on the
Open University movement, the
sunburned interviewee lit another
cigarette and continued. “all in
all, it was an exercise in futility.
Although it was clear from the be-
ginning that they wanted_the power
to define, the University adminis-
tration has the overwhelming pow-
er to define.”

He was also turned off by the
debate the -first night of the Com-
’mon Facilities sit-in about wheth-
er or not to stay and risk arrest. ‘

“What it boiled down to was a
group of well-meaning people was

  

 

using the same tactics as the ad-
ministration. Most people there
didn’t want to sit-in. It was an at-
tempt on the part of a small group
to force its attitudes and decisions
on the rest. That’s what I thought
the Open University was against,”
Holecko offered in retrospect.

“I found this self-righteousness
revolting. I don’t want to be pro-
grammed, stamped, punched or

spit out by anyone,” he emphasized.

The main contribution of the
Open University movement, ac-
cording to Holecko, was the bring-
ing together of the students in the
idea of community,” an idea vital
to the learning process. It should

have started much earlier. ,

Ken Holecko, upon leaving
“Pittsburgh super high school,”
is planning to continue his work in
history at UCLA in September. He
looked back upon his education
here through pessimistic eyes.

“I got what I wanted at this place

through extracurricular activities.
The bulk of my in—class education
was totally irrevelant. Most of the
stuff I’ve forgotten. In fact, I
could have gotten the same educa-
tion from a ten-year subscription
to Time.”

.j"“Mother love is what a
woman does and is.”

_ This quote is representa-
?tive of the attitude in our so-
ciety that places the woman in
home and keeps her there. It de-
fines her “role” and holds the
secret of her ultimate “fulflll—
ment” as a person. What it real-
ly, does is‘ to preserve the arch-
aic philosophy that women are
‘second class citizens, the modern
replacement for the household
serv.ant.

. This column is about women’s
rights, but not the stereotyped
Susan B. Anthony of the past,
but rather what that term real-
fly means for our day and age.

 -PREVIOUSLY, women frus-

trated of their rights took the

course of trying to become men.

:When pushing for the right to

vote, the Carrie nations of the 20's

-‘took to wearing men’s clothes,

gsmoking cigars, using “gutter”

-"language, in essence they tried

to become men in order to as-
-sume their natural rights as wo-
Vmen.

Today, the philosophy is dif-
ferent Women. men are not at-
; ‘tempting to become them. Rather,
the contemporary woman who
talks about women’s rights is

Women in our society do not
have a free choice as to what
i they want to do with their lives.

.-’»tions of others and of themselves
about themselves. As soon as a
girl is born, the socialization

stay-at-home housewife.

If she watches television, she
views the women in commer-
cials in the ridiculous positions
of squabbling over dishwashing
products or almost being divor-
ced because the coffee isn’t any
good. -

She -probably hears neighbor-

‘ hood gossip about the old maid

or mysteriously snide whispers
about the career girl.

How else can a girl perceive
her role in society except as
the mindless housewife who de-
votes herself lock, stock and bar-
rel to her husband and children?

MOST WOMEN never ques-
tion the fact that everything

‘that they do in their lives is tem-

porary until they find the right
man. Then they can give up col-
lege degree, profession and time-
consuming interests.

The push today is not to make
women give up the home and
delve into business, law and med-
icine. The push is to give women
the free choice to do what they
wish with their lives without hav-
ing to surrender social accepta-
bility and male companionship.

It’s entirely possible that a wo-
man with a completely free will
may decide to play the house-
wife game. But it will be her free
choice, not the response to a
complex and pervasive sociali-
zation process including the stig-
ma attached to the unmarried wo-
man. ' '

IT IS UNFAIR that women must
base their lives on expectations,
rather than aspirations. That’s
the whole point of “women’s
rights” — free choice without the
outside pressures of social stigma,‘
unfair employment
and thegthreatened loneliness. 

practices I

tablishment. From all outward ap-
pearances, it is a very hip place.
But, I don’t find it essentially
different from the straight world.

Sly and the Family Stone, an
adequate local band, and the us-
ual psychedelic regallia for five
dollars seemed a bargain at half
the price.

Realizing the expense of a
group like Sly’s and that Elec-
tric Theatre prices are compar-
able, if not cheaper, than similar
establishments in other cities, the
price is still a bit heavy.

My objection is that the five
dollar pricetag is easily com-
parable to the amount of money
spent for straight entertainment.

‘by DAVETIERNAN

I never pledged a fraternity.
I rushed one. but never pick-
ed up my bid.

One of the main reasons was
explained to me this weekend
when my brother showed me a
letter that I wrote about three
years ago while I was stationed
in Germany in the Air Force.

The part of
the ‘letter that
’was so signi-
-ficant was a
long paragraph
describing ,
“Mom’s,” a Gas-
thaus that I fre-
quented nearly '
every evening.
In that paragra-
ph I explained DAVE TIERNAN
to my brother EDITOR
that a group of guys from all dif-
ferent squadrons on base would
meet in Mom’s every night and
just sit around and b.s. We would
plan trips, discuss previous
ones; argue about sports, poli-
tics, religion, and sex; spend num-
erous hours playing Trivia.

I ended that paragraph by
saying that when I was old and
gray and sitting in a rocking
chair thinking about Germany.
I would remember Mom’s the
best.

There were no dues to pay at
Mom’s except the friendship and
respect of opinion that is due from_
one person to another. The meet-
ings were held nightly. not week-
ly. The parties were held every-
time someone got promoted, de-
moted. married. divorced. when
someone new came. when an old-
timer left. when we were happy.
when we were sad, when they put
a new song‘ on the juke box.
when they didn’t. We celebrated
birthdays, anniversaries. Dear
John’s, good weather. holidays.
and anything else that warrent-
ed a party. We laughed and we
cried. We fought foes and we
fought each other. But when the
chips were down, we were broth-
ers. We all had a common goal:
Get the hell out of the service.
We all missed our friends and fam.-
ilies in the States. and I guess
somewhere deep down in our
phyches we all felt guilty about
not being in Vietnam. Lord knows.
we settled that damn mess every
othernight in heated arguments.
Oh. by the way. we did drink a
few brews and shots of cognac
during those meetings. A few.

“Those were the days” Mary
Hopkins says. .and how trueshe
is. But let me tell you a little’
about theother reason I haven't

It is the type of price that still
appeals to a middle class and more
affluent crowd.

But my chief hang-up is the
treatment of the customers. Once
again. this form of entertainment
is not atypical of most others, ex-
pecially those of its kind, in
treating its patrons like cattle.

The management takes your
bread, then forgets about you. \

About 2000 people were wring-

ing with sweat while cramming .
- together on -the floor of the un-

ventilated second story while
waiting for Sly and his group who
were 2 hours and 15 minutes late.
Most of this time was spent in
watching the group‘s equipment
being set—up on stage. Then the
PA system never worked right
anyway.

‘Sly’s singing was audible most
of the time and the other perform-
ers hardly at all. Amazingly,
the group performed well under
the circumstances.

The Electric Theatre is just
another dehumanizing capital-
istic enterprise. The manage-

om'ers And ‘Pub'eirs

belong to a club here in Sand-
wich City that takes up about as
much time as Mom's used to. The

club is a cross between a misplac- ~ ‘

ed persons bureau and lonely
hearts club. The members vary
in age, size, s_ex. and mentality --
but I guess most membersare
pretty normal crazy people. Like
Mom’s, meetings and parties are
held just about nightly. The meet-
ing place is Wohlfarth’s Pub.

In case you're not familiar
with Wohlfarth’s location, it’s
across from Tower C on Bou-
quet Street. Yeah, the one that
used to have the real good roast
beef sandwiches. Yeah, that’s it.
The one that used to have signs
in the windows welcoming vis-
iting baseball teams to Oakland.

Someone once said that Si-
mon and Garfunkle wrote "At
The Zoo” about Wohlfarth’s,
Could be. Where else can one
find such rare and exotic breeds
of animals and birds? If they ever
change the Pennsylvania blue
laws. Highland Park will close
down.

It would take five or six issues
to tell all the funny things that

have happened’ to me in Wohl— "V

fa1”th"S and at least a small book
to explain about its cliental.

Maybe I should just store all
the memories in my mind and not
tell anyone. Holden Caulfield
said at the end of “The Catcher
In The Rye” that once you tell
someone, it’s just not the same.
But I Visited the Point for the
first time the other night. and
I’m really up on Pittsburgh this
week. Like Mom’s, I leave the Pub
every night saying that I have to
spend less time there. that I
have better things to do. etc.
But I always seem to get them
done and always seem to end up
back there. So. I decided to work
there this summer. What the hell.
may as well get paid to attend
meetings.

I worked four nights last week
after I got back from Florida.
After ten days of doing nothing
but sitting in the sun and watch-
ing television. some of the antics
during the past week seemed un-
believable. But. looking back
over the past year. they were
just average.

The first night back. I thought
Sandwich City was going to go
up in smoke. even though. it was
raining. Luckily. all the normal
people were wasting away out-
side "This place is going to pot"
I thought before I entered. But
once inside. I felt I was home
from the war. ‘

ment obviously doesn’t care
about the physical discomforts
of its audience. It charges first-
rate prices for_ a second-rate
group and then doesn’t even bother
to let them hear the group prop-
erly.

I might add that this_is just
another of several rock shows that
I have’ been to in this city where
I have paid a big buck and was
unable to hear the group’s vo-
cals.

But, Sunday was a brighter
day. I spent a pleasant sunny
afternoon at a “Be-In” _near
.CMU’s Skibo Hall. Hundreds of
people danced and listened to the
new improved Marshmallow
Steamshovel and the Electrons.
The Steamshovel sounded better
than ever, mellower and blue-
sier than before.

The only irritation in an other-
wise beautiful afternoon was a
local clothes store that circula-
ted advertisements through the
crowd. No matter where you’re
at nowadays. someone‘ always
has his hand in your pockets.

ies in the art of chugging. A few
members of the club were pre-
paring to- hold a special “open
door” meeting at’an unsuspec-

. ting member’s apartment. A few

vets were lamenting the Pir-
ates loss to St. Louis and the
rest were wining, dining and play-
ing the pinball machines. ‘A
quiet night.

The next night, my first night
on the job. was a little more event-
ful. A bon voyage party for a mem-
ber thumbing to California was
climaxed by a partial'1y-swallow-
ed bottle cap. Panic struck and
the police came just as two mem-
bers dislodged the cap with their
fingers. Some other fingers must
have been working, for the next
night three rookies claimed that
they had lost their wallets the
night before.

The marines paid the club mem-
bers a special visit the next
night, and gave a few free de-
monstrations in harrassment tac-
tics. Trouble was avoided when
the Diplomatic Corps of the club
arrived and quieted everything
down, “A ray of hope, ann, a glim-
mer of sunshine.”

Thursday night was “Oldies
but Goodies” night as the reg-
ulars ass-embled and told tales
from the years-gone—by. A spec-
ial guest spoke on Campus Dis-
order, and noted that the trouble
with college students of today is
that they don’t know where it’s.
at. “Party, party, party” was the
guest speakers explanation of the
students of years-gone—by. This
special meeting ran late, for there
had been another bon voyage par-
ty before (same theme as the
one before), so the club held a
special all—night session at one of
its regional offices.

‘Then there was Friday. Another
special lecturer spoke on the
Crucifixion of Plato by_ the
hammer and chisel of Michael-
angelo. An emergency trip to

the boxing matches in some un-
heard-of town was planned and
executed, but the band played on.
The weekend warriors were out,
and there was hell to pay.

Picture two, two-people teams
playing "chicken-fight” in two
inches of spilled beer and you
have the final scene of the Friday
night fiasco in the Pub. But
like I said. it was just an average
week. '

Cheerleader Needed?

Editor: The Pitt News,

The Hillman Library contains
nearly every comfort conducive to
serious study and research. Car-
peted floors, a bright atmosphere.
and group study rooms combine
with the comfortable chairs and
smoking areas to afford the well-
intentioned student the opportun-
ity to pursue his studies without
undue interference. -

However, I have observed one
basic infirmity in the library’s
daily operations. No provision has
evidently been enacted providing
for a cheerleader to direct the
nightly discussions. There is little
or no excuse for the lack of school
spirit evidenced by the numerous
disjunct conversations and demon-
strations which occur continually
at Hillman. Some co-ordinated plan
should be developed whereby week-
end oriented girls, date-seeking
boys, and the fraternities and so-
rorities who hold their meetings
on the first floor can be equally
represented.

I feel that the above described
noise can be functionally channel-
ed into a coherent, well-developed
cheering section, rivaling the most
raucous libraries in the nation,
with practice sessions nightly
from 7:30 until 10:30. To restore
Pitt to its previously high national
ranking, cheering hours must be
rigidly enforced. No one will be
permitted to study during these
hours and any student violating
this rule will lose his cheering priv-
leges for one month. Also, strictly
prohibited isrespect for another
student, and if such civilized con-
duct is detected, that individual
will incur a 15 day suspension.

Of course, this will entail great
sacrifice of valuable study time,
but only with a concerned, mobiliz-
ed effort can we reorganize noise-
making at Pitt. And this can only
be accomplished if we demand that
a committee be formed at once to
select the girl best suited to be
cheerleader. She should have na-
tionally recognized credentials, a
well-established name in cheer-
leading circles. Her guidance is
necessary for national prominence
to refocus on Pitt.

I implore Student Government

to immediately explore the bound— ‘

"less potentialities for increased
raucousness at the library, and I
urge an unyielding commitment

NEW LIBRARY COLLECTIONS
The University Libraries have
purchased two new collections Of
rare and interesting books.

First, the libraries purchased
the entire contents of the John C.
Daub book store, the oldest used
book shop in Pittsburgh. The col-
lection contains 10,000 books,
mainly in the areas of military and
local history.

These materials sold for $32,-
000. Following cataloging, the
works will be placed in Special
Collections and the main collec-
tion of the Hillman Library.

Also acquired by the libraries
was a 500—volume Runanian Col-
lection, which deals with the coun-
try’s history, racial, ethnic and re-
ligious minorities, folklore, art,
and politics.

Some of these works are quite
rare, and the University may pos-
sess the only copy" in the United
States. . _

The final statement drafted by
the group expressed the belief
that the United States should pur-
sue a less domineering and power-
ful course in the Far East. Fur-
ther, according to the group, the
United States should preserve the
neutrality of small nations in the

Far East (such at Vietnam) in or-

der to avoid war with China.

NEW PROGRAM

The University School of Gener-

accelerated courses to help stu-
dents qualify for admission to the
college of their choice.

The new Pre-College Program
has been designed to fill the needs
of both high school graduates with
academic deficiencies and of those
over the age of 18 who lack a high
school diploma. In the latter case,
the program will help students
prepare for the General Education-
al Development Test so that they
may receive an equivalency di-
ploma, a requirement for college
entrance.

The program will consist of a
core of essential high school level
courses. All classes will meet in
the evening, and enrollment will

Thinclads

by BOB LEDERMAN

With the fifth annual Big Four Track Classic now in the
books, Jim Banner’s thinclads will have to wait until next year
for another shot at ending Penn State’s reign of supremacy in
the annual outing. The Lions went on to accumulate 721/2 points,
finishing ahead of the trackmen’s 59, West Virginia’s 311/2 and

Syracuse’s 20.

The troubles of the men of Ban-
ner could be summed up in one

word — injuries. Dave Garnett was

sidelined for the 100-yard dash
when he pulled a thigh muscle
while coming out of the blocks
during a false start. Bryant Sal-
ter, still suffering a heel injury
he sustained last March, man-
aged a first place in the triple
jump (47’21/2”), but could only
. capture the number three spot in

' the high jump competition.

The high jump was won by
Penn State’s John Cabiati (6’41/2”)
who checked in with marks a sub-
stantial half-foot lower than Sal-
ter’s best previous (prior to the in-
jury) accomplishments.

sters’ third missing link. Drys-
dale is still recovering from head

months ago. He is not yet in shape
to go out and compete.

For the several hundred fans
who were on hand to watch the af-
ternoon’s activities, there were
many thrilling moments. Jun-
ior thinclad Jerry Richey cap-
tured firsts in the mile and the
two mile. The mile race saw Jer-
ry defeat Penn State’s Al Sheaffer
with a winning time of 4:13.0.
West Virginia coach Stan Ro-
manoski decided to enter his long
distance ace Carl Hatfield in the
two mile race and not in the
mile. ’ ‘

The strategy was for Hatfield. to

, run in’ the two mile race,’ fresh,

against a Richey who had already
ran the one-mile. As the two mile
race began, Richey fell into fourth
place after the first few laps.
About the sixth lap, Jerry was still
behind, but in ‘the number two
spot. ‘ . 1 '

It was not until late in the
seventh lap_ that Richey, who at
that point was about twenty-five
yards behind Hatfield, made his
move. With a strong kick,-Jerry
picked up speed and passed Hat-
field with about 330 yards to

'go, leaving the WVU speedster

behind.

In winning the two mile race,
Richey set a new Pitt Stadium rec-
ord as well as a new Big Four
Meet mark. ,Richey’s winning
time was 9:03.6. '

Discussing the Fate of Hatfield
in West Virginia coach Romanoski
lamented, “I thought he had it
wrapped up. I guess he just didn’t
have it today. That happens with
any runner.”

Penn State’s Mike Reid took
second place in the discus throw
and a first place in the shot put

competition. In winning in the

shot put with a 57’2-1/4 inch,
Reid topped his own previous high
mark of 57’-3/4”. That distance also
set new Big Four Meet Pitt Sta-
dium records.

The Lions also fared well in
the running events. Al Sheaf-
fer tied a seven-year old meet
record in the half-mile run (1:
53.8), while ~Ken Brinker set a
new Big Four record in the 440
yard Intermediate Hurdles (53.
8).

The thinclads’ Dan Kouvolo,
throwing for the first time this
year under favorable weather con-
ditions, tossed the javelin a rec-
’ord—breaking 229’. In setting a
new Pitt Stadium recofd, Kouvolo
put by the books a previous rec-
ord set by James DeMers of
Los Angeles in 1930 (222’61/2” ).

Versatile Smitty Brown, com-
peting in seven events last Satur-
’day, managed a first place fin-
i’sh in the 220-yard dash (22.0),
and a third place finish in the
100-yard sprint., In the 100-
yard Spring, Smitty was edged
out by West Virginia’s La-Marr
St. John and Penn State’s Ken
Brinker. The winning time

I was 9.9.

Baseballers Take Picnic in Hiram;
McCain’s Four Hits, Four RBl’s
Just Part Of Lop—sided 18-4 Win

by ED CONLEY
Bob Solonickne had another
picnic Saturday. But it wasn’t
the usual kind and his team-

mates were in on the fun as coach
Bobby Lewis’ Panther mitters won
their fourth game in six tries,
belting the Hiram nine, 18-4.

Solonickne took a couple of sand-
wiches to the team's game last
week against Grove City and ap-
propriately picked up the tag of
“Picnic” during that win. In Hi-
ram there was no food near the
bench, but the pitcher-outfielder-
slugger played the successful role
of starting hurler in the romp.

Salonicke didn’t forget his bat
at Hiram either. He helped his own
cause with two hits in four at bats
and he crossed the plate three
times.

As the score would indicate, So-
lonickne wasn’t the only mitter to
score. In fact, everyone in the
starting line-up scored at least
one time, with Ron O’Grodnik and
Joe McCain matching Solonickne’s

1 three runs.

Centerfielder McCain was the
top threat with the lumber. He
smashed out four hits (two of them
were two-baggers) and collected
four RBI’s. That boosted his total
to nine RBI’s, highest on the team.

The only mitter that didn’t en-
joy his swings in the game was
third baseman Ron Howie. He got
hit with a pitch in the first inning;

BOB KOHL was the defensive star for the mitters in Saturday's victory over

Hiram. Kohl prevented two extra-base hits with fine catches while patrol-

ling left field. At the plate, the junior outfielder walked and tripled in the
big eight-run first inning, scoring twice and driving in two runs.

that was a sign of what was to
come. Howie hit the ball hard ev-
ery time after that appearance at
the plate, but each shot was right
at somebody and he settled for an
0 for 3 day.

The third baseman is the only
regular having trouble at the
plate this spring. The squad’s
over-all batting average is up to
.309 after Saturday’s romp.

“With that hitting I didn’t have
to use much strategy,” Lewis
mentioned after witnessing the
miss-match. “And, when I had the
squeeze play on, their pitcher
threw a wild pitch.”

The squeeze play came in the
seventh inning after Frank Gus-
tine’s only hit of the day, a triple,
had driven in two runs. Lewis put
the play on with Sammy Glass at
bat. and Gustine walked in easily.
Gustine was credited with a steal
of home.

There was a bit of thievery in
the mitter outfield, too, Bob Kohl,
who got a lump on his head during
practice when he couldn’t get out
of the way of a ball, went gunning
for the pellets once the game start-
ed. He made two great catches in
the seven innings that he played.
He took a gap shot hit away from
Bob Drodlein in the fourth and
then made an over-the-shoulder
grab of Don Wailace’s drive in the
seventh.

“It must have knocked some
sense in to me,” said Kohl, refer-

ring to the ball that hit him. “But,

really, Joe (McCain) helped a lot.
He sure did help me on that sec-
ond one.”

There were a few balls hit by
Hiram that the mitters couldn’t
handle, though. The big trouble
came in the sixth and seventh
innings when Solonickne began to
tire. Drodlein did the most dam-
age, driving in two of the four
runs Hiram picked up with a dou-
ble to left. Rich Orpneck replaced
Solonickne in the eighth and the
picnic continued.

Golfers Host Indiana St.;?i:i

Kent St. In Preparation

For Upcoming Easterns

by BILL NAAB

Both Indiana State (Pa.) and Kent State have powerful golf
squads, and "today is a day of reckoning for Coach Rex Peery’s
golfers who must face both schools in the triangular compe-

tition.

the first season that we’ve beaten Indiana in the past five years.” The
triangular meet will serve as an excellent conditioner forThursday’s
Eastern Championships at Ithaca, New York.

According to Perry, the squad’s
captain and number one man,
John Meteney, has a good
chance to qualify for the 16-
man playoffs at Ithaca. “It’ll
depend on many factors. He and
one or two others have pretty
good chances. I’d like to see one
of the fellows make it this year.

It would be very encouraging,” -.

said Perry. Since Peery has been
the golf coach no one has yet
qualified for the 16—man playoff
in the Easterns.

“We’ll be going (to the Eas-

terns) no matter what happens 2

Tuesday. But, ' we’re going to
try to get something done Tues-
day,” he said. The lineup will
consist of John Meteney, Joe Vil-
ansky, Mike McGuire, Sam Zin-
ger, Ray George, Patrick Char-
les, and Henry Higgenbottom.

Today’s competition will con-
sist of a seven-man match with
each of the two teams, and one
point match play for 18 holes.
Peery seems to think that John

. Meteney’s ‘ unbeaten streak at

Shannopin Country Club will be

in danger against Indiana State.

Indiana has one of the better
golf teams in Pennsylvania, in-
cluding two first-rate linksmen.

Dave Prosser and Terry Isen-
hoot are the pride of Indiana’s
golf team. Peery is unsure of
who will battle his Meteney,
but either golfer is capable of
providing stubborn competition
for his top man.

However, the other six golf-

_-«as-'2;

Peery stated that “We’ve never beaten Kent State, and last year wasd"!'J-zl

ers will determine if the links-
ters will have a bleak or sunny
day. Peery will need to de-
pend on Ray George and Patrick
Charles to continue climbing
the victory path (both_ defeat-
ed West Virginia last week).
Higgenbottom, Zinger, Vilansky,
and McGuire must also have some
degree of success. ‘

Mitters Capture
Third In A Row

(Continued from Page 9)

“I’d rather see us win it 8-0,”
Lewis said. “I hate to see us give
up runs. You get,careless that
way.” *

The 8-0 scorewas the way the“

first inning ended. The mitters
brought 13 men to the plate before
Hiram could get a chance to bat,
and the eight tallies resulted from

' only three hits. Three walks and,a

flock of errors, wild pitches and
pass balls put the ‘mitters out of
Hiram’s reach.

The closest Hiram got was after

the sixth inning when the score
was 8-3. The mitters promptly add-
ed four runs in the top of the sev-

enth, and six more in the final two ,

frames.

The win ‘was more than the
team’s fourth of the spring. As Mc-
Cain, one of six football players on

' the team, said after the game, “it

sure felt great smashing somebody

Living Theatre Aims

F°1'C°mmun31Di310g11e Marat/Sade Restricted In DC. 

by GARY HOUSTON
College Press Service

The Living Theatre is one of
17 acting ensembles in the coun-
try (mostly from New York)
which comprise the Radical The-
atre Repertory.

According to the program sheet
for Mysteries and Smaller Pieces,
all of these groups are “in the
vanguard of a new phenomenon in
theatrical and social history—the
spontaneous generation of com-
munal playing troups, sharing vol-

, untary poverty, making experi-

mental collective creations, and
utilizing space, time, minds and
bodies in manifold new ways that
meet the demands of our explosive
period.”

One gets the conveyance of

-meaning or meanings from a par-

ticular play, but in a sense proph-
ets and revolutionaries (scientific,
utopian, and religious) appreciate,
the conveyance of meaning is tem-
poral, and the language Beck talks
—of his company going through
various stages of its own aware-
ness of the nature of men (and of
how they can be aware of them-
selves) — indicates that the most
meaningful moments of the Liv-
ing Theatre’s experience are yet
to come.

When asked how the Living The-
atre will every’ be able to com-
municate with the majority of non-
theatre-going Americans, Beck
has said: “. . . I think this prob-
lem represents our next important
work. We have to get out of that
(commerical) theatre which ca-
ters to the bourgeois elite which
has the habit and advantage of go-
ing to the theatre today, the cul-
tural elite. That is, we have to get
out of that architecture; we have
to begin to get to those people who
are damage, repressed by the
whole system into believing the
theatre is not for them, that they
are too stupid to go, that they can-
notunderstand it. Our work is to
find them, to get them and have a
meaningful dialogue with them.”

According to one’s breadth of
inclusiveness, the “damaged”
ones are just ‘as likely to be the
great mass of TV-watchers enclav-
ed in white American suburbs as
it is the black and poor stuck in
the urban slums. It is no longer
facetious to say that both seg-
ments of our people — one in mis—_
ery, the other in boredom — dwell
in ghettos.

But the Living Theatre could
very well believe in a cosmology
which says all beings are aiming
at total awareness of a single or-

. ganism in which they are but com-

ponents (Whtehead). In such a
cosmology, men are not divided by
real barriers, but by illusory ones
which conceal the true nature of
reality. Such a barrier is the hab-
it of preferring privacy or detach-
ment to participation.

The Living Theatre wants to
break the private shell and make
people public-spirited and active.
Beck says: “We try to reach the
spectator through many means,

some of them metaphysical—pene- '

tration through the skin, the use
of disturbing symbology, the stir-
ring up of emotions like irritation,
hysteria, revulsion and boredom‘.
Sometimes these things will force
a spectator to take direct action to
the degree that he will get up and
leave the theatre. This may be the
way to begin his personal journey
toward real change.”

A human observer, because he
knows he is watching a perfor-
mance (something deliberated up-
on and rehearsed by actors and
directors), is not merely caught
between socially imposed norms
on the one hand and emotions on the
other. Being intelligent, he knows
that an actor is an actor (yes. even

 

if the actor is black). If he is both-
ered and uncomfortable when an
actor shouts at him, is is not sim-
ply because he has a tolerance lev-
el which is being approached with
each successive indignity.

Those who do get violent and
excited are doubtless the good,
histrionic raging people the Living
Theatre likes, but they aren’t the
ones it wants to reach. Some emo-
tions are gut emotions but, cursed
as we are to be intellectual as well
as emotional and visceral crea-

) tures, we will always come out

with those dramatically inffect-
ual, embarrassing remarks and
with those dramatically ineffectual,
reactions which can ward off or
deflect the Living Theatre’s on-
slaught.

People are getting damned clev-
er and hip, each in his own way,
and they are hard to fool. The
mass media has accomplished that -
We can keep our cool; we can re-
main uninvolved; we can stay in-
sulated. Tragically, we are not un-
like the Frankenstein monster. We
do not receive a quantity of emo-
tional and conceptual electricity
which each of us will one day exer-
cise in a tumultuous revolution.
