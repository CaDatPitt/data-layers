Students give more Ilmn blood

By Vicky Palombizio
Staff Writer

Greeks and independents rolled up their sleeves and joined forces
last week in the ﬁght to save lives at the tri—annual Greek Week
Blood Drive.

Close to a thousand Greeksand independents gathered in Forbes

eQuad to give what many people believe to be the most precious gift
of life. . -

Together they donated over 800 pints of blood for the Central
Blood Bank, which is enough to save 2,400 lives.

James Sanders, Greek Week chairperson, said that the Greeks
sponsor three blood drives a year and that they are the third largest
donor in Western Pennsylvania. He said that although the blood
drive is based on thepoint system -— the fraternity/sorority house
with the most points(donations) wins — independents are strongly
encouraged to panicipate.

“It’s a great philanthropic event as a whole,” Sanders said. “We’re -

glad to see such a strong support from the independent crowd. I. just
wish that events like these were promoted more, especially with all
of the negative press.”

This year students also had the option of donating blood marow.

Lynne Rivoir. a registered nurse at the Bone Marrow Transplant
Unit at Monteﬁore University Hospital, urged blood donors to con-
sider donating bone marrow as well. This involved signing a con-
sent form and an extra donation of two tablespoons of blood for
HLA tissue typing.

“We’re just getting people tissue-typed for the registry,” Rivoir
said. “No actual donation is given today. We try to match the HLA
type perfectly between donor and patient. Only one donor out of
20,000 patients is a perfect match.”

Rivoir said there is no obligation. If the donor does agree to
donate, then he/she will undergo an operation. An estimated 75 to 80
percent of the students did give consent.

“The worst thing that could happen is that you would feel a little
sore and tired,” she said. “But you could save somebody’s life.”

Ann Horvat, supervisor for the Central Blood Bank, said that each
blood donation saves three lives because one unit of blood contains
red blood cells, plasma and platelets.

Horvat said the Blood Bank needs 700 pints of blood a day just to
supply Pennsylvania’s needs. These blood drives are imperative
because 25 percent of all donations are received by high school and
college students.

Theater students on low budget

By Jennifer Alpha
Staﬂ’ writer

(Editor's note: This is the first in a two-part
series on theater lab productions.)

“Action,” “Elliot Loves,” and “The Last
Words of Dutch Schultz” are three plays that
are as different from one another as “Macbeth”
is from “Grease.”

But one thing sets these plays in a collective
class of their own: they were all done as lab
productions, the student—directed, low-funded,
often experimental plays by Pitt Theatre on the
illustrious budget of $50 apiece.

In some circles, lab productions are referred
to as the “bastard child” of Pitt Theatre. That’s
because they are refused the spoils of the older,
more beautiful children of the workshops and
mainstages. Getting around restrictions to push
the limits and guidelines sometimes requires a
little strategic planning.

“When people do labs, it turns into guerrilla
theater,” Joel Lee Kulp, a junior theater arts
major and director of “Action,” said.

Directors who don’t want their show to look
like a $50 production prepare themselves to
foot additional expenses. The meager budgets,

easily spent on flyers and programs, push
directors .to seek connections who can donate
props, costumes, manual labor and technical
expertise. These resources which require no
money are invaluable. _

Lab productions rehearse for three weeks
opposed to the six weeks of rehearsals for
mainstages. Rehearsal space depends on what
is available, so location can change nightly.
Nothing is predictable in these productions. But
that doesn’t mean learning the lines comes any
easier.

Howard Williams, Jr., a senior theater arts
major and director of “Elliot Loves,” spent the
past summer researching the playwright,
choosing music and designing a plan for the set
and costumes. With only three weeks to
rehearse, every moment needs to be dedicated
to the performance.

“I wanted it to be presentable in a way that
when people are coming in there and spending
three bucks, they’re getting their three bucks
worth and maybe something more,” Williams
said.

Actors and directors pour out this energy for
an average run of three nights. To pull off a
show they’d be proud to put their name on,

JERUSALEM — An Israeli
gunman shot and killed
Yitzhak Rabin in Tel Aviv
Sunday evening as the prime
minister exited a rally sup-
porting his peace plans.
Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres has been named inter-
im prime minister by the
Israeli cabinet. It is likely he
will be asked by Israel’s
president to form a new gov-

Rabin was shot three times
as he walked to his car at one
end of a huge public rally in
Tel Aviv’s municipal square.

A man identified as Yigal
Amir, 27, a law student at Tel
Aviv’s Bar-Ilan University
was arrested and charged
with the assassination. Israel
radio reported he had lived
temporarily in a Jewish set-

The assassination throws
into disarray the move
towards peace with the
Palestinians that Rabin had
won after a long career as a
hard-line militarist.

Abortion
turns
woman
pro-life

By Stephanie Ellsworth
For The Pitt News

Some choices aren’t
always easy.
The one Mary

Beddingfield made almost
20 years ago has haunted
her ever since.
Beddingfield, of
Pittsburgh, chose to have
an abortion. It was 1977.
She was 18 years old and
married to a man who
threatened to leave her if
she gave birth to the child.
Ironically, thatmarriage
ended in 1983. “The abor-
tion was part of it, but
other things were build-
ing,” Beddingfield said.
She said she felt unedu-
cated at the time of her
abortion. .
Before the abortion was
performed, she was
required to attend a coun-
seling session which lasted
four to five minutes,
according to Beddingfield.
The counselor, she said,

asked her if she wanted an _

abortion and told her she
“was not killing a child,
but a blob of tissue.” After
the session, she signed the
release forms.

“I remember thinking,
‘This is counseling?’ I was
looking forward to it
because I needed to talk,”
Beddingfield said.

After the. abortion,
Beddingfield said, she suf-
fered from depression for
years. And the only coun-
seling she ever received
was the five—minute ses-
sion before the abortion
was performed.

“It was only in the last
two to three years that
mental health. officials
have acknowledged that
post-abortion syndrome is
a real thing,” she said.

Beddingfield, who spoke
at the Students for Life
meeting became a pro—life
activist as a result of her
firsthand experience with
abortion.

“When I first got
involved with pro-life
activism, I was thinking
more of what I had gone
through as a woman. I
didn’t want anyone else to
go through that,” she said.
Beddingfield said she also

they all take on multiple roles.

“I’m not just the director. I
have to be the stage manager,
‘assistant stage manager and prop
master,” Williams said.

In most productions, the direc-
tor’s job is done after opening
night, but not for labs. Williams
and the other directors set up the
props and furniture each night

‘ before the show opens.

Kulp says that in labs produc-

tions everything has to be covert.
actors and directors can do, so access to the prop and costume
shops is restricted. Priority is given to workshops, also directed by
students but on a larger budget, and mainstage productions.

Lab directors have to get special permission to use these limited

resources, according to Vickie Scott, associate professor and light-
ing designer for the theater department.

The fear that an idea for a set

seeking help from faculty experts.

anybody about anything, because
I was afraid that they were going
to say, ‘Didn’t anybody ever tell
you that you can’t do that?”’ Kulp
said.

—Joel Lee Kulp,
a junior theater arts major

and director of “Action”

Still, the frustrations in planning covert strategies and hunting
for donations seem to be balanced by the learning that comes from
the experience.

Kulp said.

Aside from the faculty advi-
sor assigned to each produc-
tion, there is basically no help,
Kulp said. The advisor acts as
the only key to the department.
Unfortunately, no single person
can be an expert in all aspects

of theater production.

Rich Keitel, a faculty advisor
to the lab productions, said he
understands the complaints and
often advocates to increase the
budgets and narrow the restric-
tions for lab productions but

also believes they are an’

invaluable training ground.

“My philosophy is when you '

are first starting, you should

through service.

“We donate our time to
whoever needs it,” said
Kristen Over, vice presi-
dent and secretary of the
honor society. “We are
really interested in sharing
our ideas and helping oth-
ers.”

Every two years, the
National Organization of
Mortar Board chooses a
topic for the National
Service Project. Smith
attended this national con-
ference, where she present-
ed an idea to focus on chil-
dren’s»issues, which was
accepted almost unani-
mously.

“We are firmly commit-
ted to focusing on helping
children,” Smith said.

The group members have
many service activities
planned for the semester.
They are participating in
the Oakland Clean Up pro-
ject. They are also
involved with Family
House. For Halloween,
they participated in an
evening of backyard mon-
sters.

“We also want to do
some original things, too,
that are not necessarily
through a group,” Smith
said. “We as a group
believe that the more peo-
ple we have, the more
things we can do, so we
would like to begin by

The focus of service,

achievement is in essence
the life and motivation of
which the leaders and
members of Mortar Board
are proud.

Pro-life

°From page 3

suffered physical compli-
cations as a result of the
abortion.

“Women should know
the truth before they make
that decision,” she said.

Beddingfield also said
she feels it is important for
an individual to understand
what being pro-life means.

“It’s not sufficient to just
make a statement,” she
said. “If you’re not putting
that to action in your daily
life, it doesn’t mean a
whole lot.” Part of being
pro-life, according to
Beddingfield, is backing
up words with actions.

Beddingfield said she
likes to be at the abortion
clinics to do sidewalk
counseling, which is sim-
ply talking to women who
have appointments and
offering help. “Sometimes
they justiwant to know
they’re not alone,” she
said.

She also stressed the
importance of the woman’s
role in the abortion
process. In addition to the
possibility of physical and
emotional scarring, feel-
ings of guilt also may
result, she said. “There’s
not just a child dying,
there’s also a woman’s
spirit dying,” Beddingfield
said. ’ .

However, Beddingfield
said men also are affected
by abortion. “Each child
that is dying is leaving
behind a father as well as a
mother,” she said. “It takes
a man to have a baby. Men
do have a stake in this.”

She said life should be
regarded as valuable no
matter 'what the case.
“When life is devalued at
any stage, it is devalued at
every stage.”

Beddingfield, now 36, is
a mother of two. “Children
are a gift, not a burden,”
she said.

But, she said, she will
live with the guilt from the
choice she made 18 years
ago for the rest of her life.

   

Blood drive

“One of our goals today is to
make this a good experience for

“Hopefully these students will
continue to donate on a regular
basis.”

Donor member because one-of
her Greek friends suggested it.

“I saw that there was a blood

Arlene Chan, 21, said that she
regularly donates for her sorori-

ty, Sigma Delta Tau.

“I donated three times last year
at the Greek Week blood drives,
because there are always people
in need of blood,” she said.

Matt Friedman, 22, said that
he donated on behalf of his fra-
ternity house, Delta Tau Delta.

“I think it’s important to
donate blood, because it’s a

.major contributor in saving

lives,” he said.

criteria must be met before a per-
son can become a donor. Some
of these include being between

“Donating blood is actually a
healthy process,” she said. “Your
body sheds old cells and is stim-
ulated to make newer, healthier
cells.”

Horvat said the primary reason
people give for not donating
blood is that they’ve never been
asked. They are also concerned
about pain, getting sick, fainting

 

and contracting a disease from a
dirty needle.

Horvat said" one of the biggest
fears is contracting AIDS and
other diseases related to blood
transfusion. However, this fear is
easily eliminated with sanitary
precautions.

“A lot of people are just apa-
thetic,” she said. “It is absolutely
impossible to get a disease from

thing is used once and then dis-
carded.”

 Peacekeeper mourned

 

 

When Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed two
days ago, Israel lost one of its most beloved leaders. The world
lost a soldier, politician, statesman and peacemaker.

Israel held its breath for a moment while the rest of the
world watched on television. Ironically, Yitzhak Rabin was
leaving a peace rally when he was shot three times at close
range by Yigal Amir. Rabin died shortly after at lchilov
Hospital in Tel Aviv.

Rabin was the Israeli equivalent of Abraham Lincoln. He
was one of the most liked and most respected leaders of Israeli
history. Rabin served as commander in chief of Israelis mili-
tary during the I967 capture of Arab territory. He was also one
of the most successful advocates of peace between different
Middle East factions.

Rabin was the man who successfully negotiated an agree-
ment with Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat, which in effect returned Israeli territory to Palestinian
rule. His goal had been to stop the bloodshed that continued in
those territories, and his agreement with Arafat was a positive
step toward that goal.

When Rabin was assassinated, approximately 100.000 peo-
ple crowded into Kings Square to await the news of Rabin’s
condition. When his death was announced, voices shouted.
“Rabin is a martyr! Rabin was a king of Israel!” (Pittsburgh
Past-Gazette, Nov. 5)

Shortly after Rabin’s death, the Israeli Cabinet met to name
Rabin’s interim successor, Shimon Peres. He will serve 
Prime Minister through this period_of turmoil and until an
eventual replacement can be named.

“You cannot kill the noble idea of peace,", echoed Peres yes-
terday as he spoke of moving on in the aftermath of the slay-
ing.

Moving on is crucial. Israelis and Palestinians have been

fighting forthousands of years, and (just like the bitter dispute

that’s going in Northern Ireland) it’s difficult just to stop and
change directions. '

But that is exactly what Yitzhak Rabin set out to do two
years ago. With a lifetime of fighting the PLO in his heart,‘
Rabin signed an historic accord for peace with the “enemy."

It was a treaty that many long-time lsraeli—PLO followers
said they thought they would never live to see. In fact. some
people. from both Israel and the PLO, still didn’t want to see a
peace treaty signed. There is a lot of hate in the Middle East,
and some were not ready to give it up.

It seems like the suspect accused of murdering Rabin wasn't
ready to give up the hate either. Yigal Amir, a law student who
is now in Israeli custody, said he acted “on orders from God.”

But “the time for peace has come. Enough of blood and
tears.” as Rabin once said to his countrymen. And despite the
internal dispute and discontent from some Israelis. Rabin
pressed on for peace.

In an era where role models are non—existent, where courage

D is almost invisible, where guts and political leaders usually

don’t mix, Yitzhak Rabin stood alone. The international com-
munity. from Tel-Aviv to Pittsburgh. will miss him.

Charities choke the life out of us

nd if
y o u
__j____:___ would
like to help the children Sally
Struthers spoke about, then
just pick up the ...” Stop! Put
the phone down. Do not
make that call. I know what
you’re wondering: “Why
wouldn’t we want to save the
children? It only costs $10 a
month. That’s less than I pay
every day for a cup of cof-
fee.”

The problem with people
who give to charities is that

ason
urtts

they think with their hearts.

and not with their heads.
Consider the situation this
way. You just saved one
child. and you feel great. You
write a check for a couple of
dollars every month and
don’t think anything else of
it. Ten years pass. Now your
child has six children of its
own. In a few more years,
these kids will have several
children each. Are you will-
ing to give several hundred
dollars every month? By sav-
ing that first child, all his or
her offspring become your
responsibility.

'Overcrowding is the single
greatest crisis which will face
mankind in the next millenni-
um. All of our problems,
from the environment to
crime to poverty. will be able
to be traced back to over-
crowding. If you consider the
scenario I proposed in the
previous paragraph played
out over a thousand—year
period, it becomes apparent
that this type of charity is not
part of the solution.

Another problem is med-
ical research. It starts with
good intentions, but where
does it end? Is the end goal
of medical research to cure
all disease and have humans
live forever? Can you imag-
ine the state of the planet if a
billion people were born
every 20 years but no one
died? The earth would soon

reach peak capacity, and
mass starvation would occur.
Unless the researchers can
“cure” people of the desire to
reproduce, they had better
think long and hard before
we go too" far. The United
Nations is very proud of
itself because it has managed
to eradicate smallpox. All
this cure has created is more
people in need of food and
shelter in an environment
which cannot support them.
Think about the condition of
the world today. Would it
really be so bad if AIDS
wiped out about three or four
billion people? Some people
might call it a tragedy; I call
it a fresh start.

Now let’s take a look at the
Special Olympics. This char-
ity is one which has the
opposite effect of the ones
mentioned above. As
opposed to going too far, it
does absolutely nothing. The
kids run around; the parents
cry; medals are given out;

. and at the end of the day 

guess what, the children are
still disabled. What’s the
point? The kids feel better
about themselves for a little
while, but they aren’t cured.
They can’t contribute any
more to society than they
could before the events.

Soup kitchens and home-
less shelters are my next tar-
get. While I will concede that
some people really are in
need, most of the homeless
are losers who should have
drank a little less, worked a
little more and studied a little
harder. I know there have got
to be other Oaklanders out
there besides me who have
no sympathy for the “Help
me out please” guy and the
rest of his buddies. Even if
these people are there
through no fault of their own.
they are lost now. There is
only a finite amount of
money to be spent on truly
worthy charitable endeavors,

and it must be used wisely.

Believe it or not, there are
some charities which are
actually of value. A good
example is Project Bundle-
Up. This may seem like a
contradiction based upon the
previous paragraph, but it
isn't. The program fulfills the
criterion of a good charity, it
solves a short—term problem
without exacerbating a long-
term one. Project Bundle—Up
provides coats for needy
families in the Pittsburgh
area. While this may make
being homeless more tolera-
ble, it certainly doesn‘t make
it attractive. That is the prob-
lem with homeless shelters.
Studies have shown that
when more shelters have
been built with lower stan-
dards for entry. the homeless
population in an area goes
up. In areas where rules have
been tightened for entry into
shelters. the homeless popu-
lation has gone down.

I know what you are won-
dering: “What does this crazy
libertarian think is the best
charity to which I can give
money?” I’m glad you asked.
You may be surprised to
learn that millions of individ-
uals already “donate” hun-
dreds of dollars to this cause
every year. The winner is . .
the public school system.
That’s right! By donating to
schools you can create a citi-
zenship which is more edu-
cated, more moral and better
able to support itself finan-
cially. Giving our young chil-
dren safer schools, better
books and smarter teachers
will onlymake us stronger as
a country. So the next time
you have a couple of extra
dollars in your pocket. don’t
contribute to overpopulation,
don’t give it to an alcoholic
loser. and don’t waste it on a
worthless program. Instead,
give it to the future.

You wanted to be the

Ron Powlus, Notre Dame’s

Powlus, a redshirt sopho-

but he broke his collarbone
in preseason camp and
missed the entire year.

Coming into last season,
which was his only healthy
year at Notre Dame, Powlus
was among the Heisman-

local and national college
football analyst, predicted
Powlus would walk away
with the trophy three times

fizzled under the pressure.
He led Notre Dame to one of
its worst seasons in recent
memory (6-5-l).

‘But it didn’t have to be this

The Pitt soccer team won its 13th
game of the season Saturday, more
victories than any other team in
school history, beating Georgetown
for the first time since 1985.

Going into the game, Pitt had won
seven of its last eight, and
Georgetown four of its last five.

Senior midfielder Todd Graf scored
the only goal of’ the 1-0 game six min-
utes into the second half. '

“We hung in tough and beat a good
team,” head coach Joe Luxbacher
said. “In terms of emotion and effort,
I can’t ask for any more.”

Graf’s goal was his fourth of the
year and third game-winning goal of
theseason. Phil Matilla picked up the
assist byheading the ball at Hoya
goalie David Stapleton. Stapleton (7-
7-2) made a diving save but couldn’t
recover before Graf knocked in the
rebound.

“It was great effort,” said senior
captain J.L. Gorsin. “We needed
somebody to come up big and Todd
did. He’s been there for us.”

Graf scored on his only shot of the
game.

“I thought Todd played his best
game of the season,” said head coach
Joe Luxbacher. “He was all over the
field. He played well defensively as
well as when we had the ball.”

Pitt goalie Adam Spitzer turned
away 10 Hoya shots to pick up his
seventh shutout of the year and the

19th of hiscareer. His 13 victories‘

lead the Big East.

game, Geo~rgetown’s Billy Bednarz
took a shot that Spitzer deflected to
an attacking Gil-Ignacio Ascunce.
Spitzer recovered in time to snare
Ascunce’s rebound attempt.

‘Five minutes later, Spitzer made the
save of the game. Georgetown’s Tom
Greaser was left unguarded in the
goalie box and launched a shot
towards the upper-left corner. Spitzer

was able to make a diving save to pre-
serve his shutout.

“Adam played a great game. He was
incredible back there,” Gorsin said.
“He saved us a few. The shot from the
six—yard line was point blank, and he
made a great save on it.”

Spitzer and the Panthers also had a
little luck on their side.

The Pitt swimming and
diving team swept its first
home meet last Saturday,
with both men’s and
women’s squads defeating
Syracuse and St.
Bonaventure in the three-
team event.

The men's team dominated
its contest, holding the lead
throughout the event and fin-
ishing with a 162-81 victory
over Syracuse and a 189-40
domination of the Bonnies.

Standouts for the men’s

“As a whole, we all did
really well,” said Soulakis of
the divers’ performance.
“We were surprised we beat
them as big as we did.”

Soulakis called the victory
a “great confidence booster”

and said he is looking for-
ward to the next meet, which
is two weeks from now at
Ohio State versus the

Samantha Linke for second

place in both contests.

Key swimming perfor-
mances for the women’s
team were turned in by
Samantha Chabotar and Jill
Fletcher, who each won two
events. Chabotar, a freshman
and the team’s leading dis-
tance swimmer, took the
l,OOO-meter freestyle in the
meet’s first singles event
and came back to finish fifth
in the 200 and win the 500-
meter event in the meet’s
later stages. Fletcher won
the 200-meter individual
medley, took third in the
200-meter breaststroke and

finished second in the 100 _

freestyle behind St.
Bonaventure’s Anna
Belliveau.

“I was so pleased with the
way everybody swam,” said
Chabotar, who was happy
with her performance

against Syracuse, a school
she visited during

the

recruitment process.

When asked about the
fatigue factor in swimming
1,700 meters in one after-
noon, Samantha downplayed
it and said, “I just get out
there with whatever I have
left.”

Other winners for the Pitt
women included Isabel
Dejo, who took the 50—meter
freestyle in under 25 sec-
onds, and Erin Bissell, who
bested teammate Fletcher
and Lisa Balzer of St.
Bonaventure in the 200
breaststroke. The freestyle
and medley relay teams fin-
ished first and second,
respectively.

Syracuse defeated St.
Bonaventure on the men’s
side 169-72, behind
Miroslav Vucetic, the
Croatian-born sophomore
who won two freestyle
events in the contest. On the
women’s side, Syracuse
erased an early St.
Bonaventure lead to win
128-115.

°Frompage 7

With three minutes left in
the first half, Spitzer mis-
judged a bouncing ball, and
it went over his head. Jeff
Porter was able to clear the
shot just before it crossed
the goal line.

Then, at 63:13, Spitzer
snagged a high shot in the
box. But Brett Stezoski was
called for a foul during the
play, giving Georgetown a
direct kick. Before the ref-
eree blew the whistle to
restart action, Ben
McKnight shot the ball past
Spitzer for an apparent
goal.

But the goal was called
off since the referee hadn’t
started play. This allowed
Pitt to set up a wall in front
of Spitzer, and it denied
McKnight on his second
chance.

“It was getting scary back
there, but we kept our heads
and kept getting the ball out
of our defensive end, and
we pulled off the victory,”

Gorsin said.

As it has done all year,
Pitt’s defense shut down its
opponent’s top scoring
threats.

Georgetown has five of
the top 13 scorers in the Big
East. McKnight is first with
10 goals and three assists
for 23 points in conference
play. He was guarded by
Stezoski all game and only
got off one shot.

“Brett matched him up
well height—wise, and he did
a good job shutting him
down,” Gorsin said.

The conference’s sixth
best scorer, forward Raul
Ferrer (eight goals, 10
assists), had no shots.

Pitt’s record stands at 1-3-
5 and 8-3 in the Big East.
The loss drops Georgetown
to 8-9-2 and 5-5-1 in con-
ference play.

Pitt is now ranked third in
the ISAA’s Mid-Atlantic
Region heading into next
weekend’s conference
championships. Penn State

and Robert Morris are
ranked first and second,
respectively.

Luxbacher said he hopes
to have at least three of his
six injured players back
in time for next weekend.
Drew Kopp, Josh Brooks
and Knut Saeter all missed
Saturday’s game with ankle
injuries. Kopp, a freshman,
is Pitt’s leading scorer
with six goals and three
assists.

It will be only the third
time in 13 years that the
Panthers play in the Big
East Championships. They
will have the number-two
seed behind Boston
College, who finished first
in the conference.

“We’re not playing as
well as we can. We’ve had a
long season with 18 games,
and we’re all banged up,”
Gorsin said. “But we’ve got
a week to get prepared for
the Big East Tournament.
We’ll be ready. We’ll defi-
nitely be ready.”

Great White swimming with
a bunch of goldfish. He
could have been.Pitt foot-
ball’s savior. He could have
been the next Dan Marino..
That year was coach

Johnny Majors’ first year
back in his second stint
here. A prize like Powlus
would have sped up the pro-
gram’s rebuilding process
exponentially. He would
have been Majors’ main cog
in turning around the pro-

gram.
Powlus would have been

. able to show his pure pass-

ing skills at Pitt. Instead,

_ he’s being used predomi-

nantly as an option quarter-
back, which limits his skills
considerably.

But Notre Dame’s coach
Lou Holtz had too much to
offer. Holtz dangled the
Fighting Irish’s rich tradi-
tion of winning in front of
Powlus. He told him about
Notre Dame’s contract with
NBC, a contract that has it
on national television on a
weekly basis. Holtz showed
Powlus the crate full of
bribes to the bowl coalition,
stating that even if they
were mediocre at best, like
last year, they would still go
to a bowl. Sure enough, the
Irish went to the Fiesta
Bowl last season, and their
luck ran out as Colorado
stampeded them 41-24.

Majors couldn’t hang with
Holtz’s artillery, and Powlus
went to South Bend, Ind.

Now he has to suffer the
consequences. The football
gods are punishing him for
not choosing Pitt. They saw
the opportunity for the
Panthers to finally rise to
nati-onal prominence like
they once were. Instead,
Powlus must feel the wrath.

So much for the luck of
the Irish.
