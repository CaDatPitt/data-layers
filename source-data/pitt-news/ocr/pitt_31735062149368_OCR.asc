dependent Party, open to any Uni-
versity student, will be held today

Called by the executive committee
of the student organization, the con-
clave intends to select candidates for
representation in Student Faculty As-
sociation and others for College Asso-
ciation.

KEYNOTE SPEECH

J. Karl Stark, C40, has been select-
ed to open the meeting. First on the
agenda will be the selection of the
convention chairman, who will sound
the keynote address.

Nomination of candidates will fol-
low and will include the choosing of
alternates for the various positions.
Six senior men, three senior women,
six junior men and three junior
women, will be chosen to bear the
party label as candidates for SFA.
They will then apply to the SFA ex-
ecutive committee for nomination in
the general student elections in April.
PARTY PLATFORM

Also to be chosen are candidates
for president, vice-president, treas-
urer, and secretary of College Asso-
ciation.

Adoption of the party platform will
conclude today’s meeting.

Nominations will ﬁrst be placed on
the ﬂoor in a report presented by the
executive committee’. Composed of
Edward Springer, C39, Jack Hoeveler,
C40, Clarence Sheppard, BA40, Stark,
Adele Yorio, C41, Rugy Aldisert, C41,
and Milton Moskovitz C42, this com-
mittee was created at the third or-
ganization meeting of the student

group.
FIRST OF ITS KIND
“Even students who have not

signed party membership cards are
welcome to attend today’s meeting,”
announces Hoeveler. “Provisions have
been made that participants will be
able to bring their lunches to the con-
vention.”

Today’s convention marks the first
nominating convention of its kind in
the history of the University. Ac-
cording to a statement by the execu-
tive committec it is the “first attempt
to make student nominations demo-
cratic.”

The party spokesmen also state that
their organizzition is “not a clannish
group limiting membership and par-
ticipation on the basis of fraternity or
non-fraternity affiliations.”

“Our program is simply based on
the assumption that student ofﬁcers
should be chosen on merit, not by po-
litical deals,” they declare.

Art Department Exhibits Chinese
Paintings, Handicraft Techniques

A

By John Brosky
To demonstrate the techniques em-
ployed in the more important Chi-

nese arts and handicrafts, the ﬁne.

arts department is presenting an ex-
hibition of Chinese paintings and
material which will remain on ex-
hibit in the seventh ﬂoor galleries un-
til March 21.

In the display are paintings and
sketches, art rubbings, various forms
of art brushes, colors, pallettes, ink
seals, and brush pots. The exhibi-
tion is being circulated by the Amer-
ican Federation of Arts.

Supplementing the exhibition to
further illustrate Chinese technique,
the ﬁne arts department contributed
several of its paintings and rubbings.
A reproduction of a fresco, the Ming
Dynasty, was loaned by Walter R.

Hovey, acting head of the depart-|

ment.

Commenting on the exhibition, Dr.
Hovey said, “The signiﬁcance of
original works of art in arousing in-
terest_ on the part of the students is
invaluable. From the point of View
of a scholar however, reproductions
of other paintings are adequate, but
they lack the emotionalism and real-
ism which are essential elements to
an artist.”

1 the ﬁgure.

The rubbings are reproductions of
stone paintings of Chinese kings
and dancers. They are made by plac-
ing a silk cloth or paper sheet over
the painting, and then, rubbing over
The impression is left on
the covering.

Of outstanding interest are the ﬁve
volumes of the Mustard Seed Artists
manual. These volumes, printed in
China during the seventeenth cen-
tury, contain illustrations of men,
rocks, trees, and other objects to be
used as a model for artists.

Besides the brushes, pallettes, and
ink seals on which an artist inscribes
a phrase of good wishes, there is one
ipainting of special interest. It is a
Ecolored Chinese scroll, a little over
‘six feet in length.

The painting is done on silk, and
lit is a typical example of Chinese
:technique. In various colors, it
ishows an artist’s expression of na-

.ture in an exquisite conventional
.form. It “subordinates man to na-

ture.”

The exhibition is now being shown

5 Cathedral. It is open to both the

istudent and the public.

Students, ﬂhancellor to Exchange

side chats” with student leaders, Dr.
John G. Bowman, chancellor of the
University, will exchange ideas with

students invited by the Senior Court
of the Women’s Self Government
Association at his ofﬁce tomorrow
at 2:30 o’clock.

Students who wish to attend these
informal sessions with the chancellor
must request that their names be put
on the invitation list in the dean of
Women’s oﬂice. Acting as a hostess
committee for the meetings, the Sen-
ior Court selects from this list the
students who will go to the meetings.

Discussion in the meetings, so far,
has dealt with thoughts of how a
college or university can make the
student more than a competent law-
yer, doctor, or professor, according
to Chancellor Bowman.

“How may I get the most out of
my four years at college.” “How can
I really amount to something?” are
examples of the questions asked by
men and women students.

Commenting on the talks, Chan-
cellor Bowman said, “These young
people are recognizing that what
ever they get out of education they
will get out of life. When they say

In the seventh of a series of “ﬁre-9

that they want to amount to some-
thing, they men they want more than
a job.’

“They want friends, adventure,
happiness. They are realizing that
to learn how to get and hold these
may take more energy and more
time than to learn chemistry, or med-
icine, or law.”

Explaining these meetings as ty-
ing in with. his philosophy of edu-
cation, Dr. Bowman added, “To think
hard, to think justly, to think to a
purpose—this kind of thinking was
the kind the people of Pittsburgh
wanted from education, here, when
they built the Cathedral of Learning.

“Building for education like that
is never ﬁnished; it renews itself in
purpose and in meaning with each
new meeting of teacher and student
in a classroom.

“Education is, after all, the ex-
pression of a practical hope that
young men and young women will
ﬁnd that they can do best, throw
themselves into the doing, and real-
ize the whole of life and not merely
a part of it.”

Chancellor Bowman closed, “And
to be quite frank about these talks
and their value, I am the one who is
learning most from them.”

it was soinctliing more or less expected. and now
we realize that there isn’t much we can do about ‘it.

I know what Jock meant to 1'cgzil21i- i’cllm\':< like
you. I realize that he stoocl for all the ﬁne tliiiias
in life to you, that to you he was one of the greatest
men in the world.

But Jock has resigned, Timotliy. Aiul .uot1hin;1'
will bring him back now. No, not even your
taking the Panther from the back of your ,iacke'i‘
aiid. Sil}'lil§;‘ that you will not replace it until --lock
ngaiii becomes head coach at Pitt.

It is all very final. People at Pitt 1'l§Illl' now are
talliing.-: about putting: up a plaque for Joel: here in
the (toiumons liooin, so lie will be l‘Plll(‘!‘ull)i?l‘C(l in
t'uture years. I giicss i'l:'s a pretty good idea. hlut
I sonictinzcs wonder if it isn't too much like piittiiig
up a moimment to someone dead. Plaques are such
cold. lifeless things.

And you've read in the papers you sell, Tim-
othy, that Jimmy Hagan will announce the name of
the new coach this week. So they must mean
business.

But I've been worrying lately, too. I rczul in
the papers the other day how the American His-
torical Associatioii liad ('ll21llg‘E‘(l its mind about
holding a convention here, because the l.'nivei-sity
had been ccusiired for “violation of principles of
academic freedom. "

And the same day. l got a letter from a friend in
New York who wrote: “The papers here don't
think much of Pitt anyniore scholastically as well
as in atlilclics . . . I do hope that all the comments
being made will cause soiiictliiiig to be done about
conditions there.”

So you see, Timothy, that there are a lot of other
things mixed up in it. And they often get me, and
a lot. of other people around here puzzled and wor-
1'l€(l', and we sort of don "t know what to do.

Y\’e’re both in the same boat, Timothy. \Ve're
just a couple of worry-warts. You're worried
about Jock; we’re worried about all these things
people are saying about our University and just
what can we do about it.

-\Vell, Tim, I know you want to get back and
sell your papers. and I’vc got to get this paper out
some time. So as one newspaperman to another,
all I-can say is keep your chin up.

Your friend,

The Editor.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Since the Uni\.re1'.3:7t_=,', of Pit.isburdh is: an educational
institution and not a ball club. little or nothing of the
supposedly disastrous acimi.nis1;i‘ative conditions under-
lying the difficulties l‘fl’v'OlV€d in the present campus
crisis is l~:::-own bv any relatively large number of per-
sons. Our executive organization, I think, has always
consisted of men fully :-ware of their I-.‘9S_'{)O2‘.Sll)llltl€S.
Why, "iov-.1 do we consider ‘them as unfair, jorejudiced,
political, antagonistic, as just “too damn dumb” to un-
derstand the relative value of certain activities to this
institution? Perhaps, upon a more intensive period of
objective reflection, we may find those evident inconsist-
encies and irreconcilable attitudes due not to an intol-
erable maladministration, nor to a passive faculty, but
to the somewhat ethereal imagery of a “psychopatholo-
gical” student body.

Sincerely,
J. L. M. C40.

This year, for the ﬁrst time in a great number of years, it was a
cinch to select ﬁve men for an All-City basketball team.

consistent" Pitt team, is to my way

never letting up, always ﬁghting.
Eddie is the <:ity’s.c1everest ball-
handler. surest dribbler and is sec-
ond only to Duquesne’s Becker in hit-
ting the hoop. He’s a remarkable
ball-hawk for a sophomore, and an
intelligent defensive operator.
STARK IS CAPTAIN

Morris Becker, Professor Chick
Davies dead-eye dandy, is to Du-
quesne what Rube Stark is to Car-
negie Tech in L1 scoring way. The
lanky Becker is a reminder of two
former Red and Blue courtmen, Birch
and Bonn. Becker

and cool. On the clefensc, even
though he is only a first-year man,
hc’s more annoying to the opposition

Max He.nnum’s six foot four inch

post early in the sectional campaign.

more than his share of loose balls 
under-the-bankboard scrambles. De-

Iensively—we1l, he’s big and he’s

smart. That’s a hard comlnnution to
beat.
BEBNAR STEADY

Duquesne’s Rudy Debnar, moved

from a forward slot, and Paul Wid-
owitz, moved from center, round out
the team at guards. Debnar is Coach

Davies’ steadiest periorrner, steady in =

every department. His shooting is
better than average and he supplies
assist passes to his teammates for
tallies with almost monotonous reg-
ularity.

Widowitz is probably the least ap-
preciated of the Duquesne dribblers.
His play is sly-like. Widowitz is a
ﬁrst-rate ﬁeld goaler—long-distance
and short. Under the hoop he’s un-
stopable. He’s the most unselﬁsh
Ibasketballer Zl’v.e ester seen, and, as

can make the:

such, he goes unacclaimed.

None of the second-teamers are
even comparable to the regulars, al-
though they do make up a pretty of-
fcctive club. Tumpane and Combs,
Tech; Milkovich and Urso, Duquesne.
and Paffrath, Pitt, compose a team
that should never be left to amuse ‘it-
self near an unguarded basket.

Pitt’s traveling cindermen head
west again this week-end when they
stop over at Indianapolis, next Sat-
urday, for the annual Butler relays.

Top track outﬁts from the mid-
west sector will bare their legs at
these Butler games, and Panther thin
clads will do well to ﬁnish as high as
last Saturday’s Central Intercollegi-
iate’s third place.

Coach Olson will probably shift

Johnny Woodruff back to anchor
spot on the mile relay team. During
the absence of Woodruff, Larry Tre-
gonning and then Clyde Graf served
as capable under-studies.
1 While Notre Dame and Marquette
Eﬁnished one, two in the Central In-
', tercollegites, the third place Panthers
‘successfully defended two titles, and
 captured two ﬁrsts.

The mile relay team of Ohl, Ferra-
ra. McKee, and Graf breezed home
by a comfortable margin, winning
this event for the second straight
year. Woodruff repeated last year’s
victory by leading the pack home in
the half mile.

Frank Ohl left his relay activities
long enough to win the 440-yard
dash, and Johnny Bazyk won the shot
put. Other point winners were Dave
McDowell who ﬁnished fourth in the
high jump. Joe Newman who took
third in the 60-yard high hurdles,
and Johnny Woodruff who placed
second to Ohl in the 440-yard dash.

Mitterling Calls for Outﬁeld Prospects
As Opener for Baseball Team Nears

By Bill McElWa.in ,

\‘Vitl1 opening day less than a month away, baseball coach Ralph 
Mitterling announced today that the third group of varsity baseball’
prospects. the outﬁelders, should report at the indoor practice ﬁeld
near Gate 3 of the Stadium at 4 :30 oiclock this afternoon.

All boys who have not" yet had their athletic record cards ﬁlled
out and approved must do so before reporting for practice. The cards
may be received from Mr. Whitson in¢
the Stadium equipment room.

The arrival of the outﬁelders will
complete the group of candidates for
a squad which should include from
25 to 30 men after the ﬁrst weeding-
out.

At the present time, between 30
and 40 have been working out
in the revamped quarters under-
neath the south end of the Stadium.
A larger number of boys is expected
when the team goes out of doors.
FIVE PITCHERS

The close of the basketball season
has resulted in several boys becom-
ing available for baseball duty while
several others will transfer their
actions to the diamond as soon as the
hockey season ends.

While it has been difﬁcult to make
:-my reliable observations on the in-
loldcrs from their indoor workouts,
the pitchers and catchers have beené
subject to the careful scrutiny of;
Coach 1‘/Htterling and his verbal reac-
tions to than have been generally
I.avoral_)1e.
pitchers, including L-awry,
who just reported, look like good bets ;
to stick as front line zzioundsmeng
Three of the boys, Pommerschein, 
Trcola, and Haluska, are sophomores,
L  is a senior, and the :ll‘th,
l\/ladva, is a junior.

Of the quintet, Treola is the lone
left hander, although one or two other
soutltpaws will later be carried on
the squad. Chunky Joe has plenty
of smoke, but needs control badly.
CATCHERS OUT

Lanky Joe Pommerschein and-
stocky Haluska have yet to let out as
much as they might, but are expected
to begin pouring the ball in for keeps
when outdoor drills begin, a day de-
pendent entirely on an improvement
in the weather conditions.

Behind the bat, Mitterling may
count upon a junior and a sophomore.
Basketballer George Hartman looks
like the fair-haired lad of the Panther
backstop crew, while Salko is run-
ning second. However, both Bill
Schildecker and Vic Williams of the
hockey team are expected to put up.

arguments in order to prove that
Hartman and Salko can’t be accepted
as the only men under consideration
for the job.

While the inﬁeld is, at present, a
batch of question marks, one position
seems to be just about settled. At
the start of the season, second base is
pretty surely to be covered by Eddie
Straloski, All District star of the
Carlson cagers.

Bob Funkh-au.=er's failure to keep
up with the scholastic requirements
of the athletic department has cost
the Panthers a probable inﬁeld starter
while the decision to keep the grid-
,ders off the diamond has hurt the
isquad’s chances in several important
ispots.

Playoff Series
Revenge Wine

Only one more game, that with
Tech Saturday night, remains for
John McSo1'ley’s ice squad before
the divisional playoffs with Duquesne

next Week _ Night Calls PE. 0519

The dates for the playoff have Free catmog pen Evenings
deﬁnitely been set as Monday, March _  '-'~    
20, Wednesday, March 22, and if:
necessary, which the Panthers claim
it won’t be, Saturday, March 25.

Contrary to the totals goal plan
used last year, the series will be on
the best-out-of-three, with the play-
offers ending on Wednesday night
should. either team make a clean
sweep of the ﬁrst two combats. The
winner will meet the western divi-
sion victors, probably John Carroll,-
for the so—called league champion-
ship.

hough fundamentally a money
making scheme, the playoffs will
provide Pitt with a chance to prove
to local hockey fans that the Dukes
are not the superior team which the
season’s records indicate.

In four games this year, Duquesne
clipped the Mcsorleymen three times
but in none of the games was the
margin of victory more than two
goals. The Panthers took the opener
2-1, dropped the next one 2-0, the‘
Dukes’ ﬁnal tally coming when Mc-
Sorley had removed goalie Ellis and
sent six men up the ice, and then
lost the last two by 3-2 margins.

The ﬁrst three engagements were
marred by mass riots and frequent
squabbling with ill feeling the im-
mediate consequence, but the fourth
contest, though devoid of ﬁghts, end-
ed in a bitter protest of a referee’s
decision, the protest taking the form
of a refusal by Mcsorley to ﬁnish
the game.

Referee McGovern awarded the
game to the Dukes after waiting two
minutes for the Panthers to return to I
the ice.

Dr. Gaines Notes Attitude

Of Fear in Youth Today

Educator Claims
Vital Scholarship
Will Cure World

“Stand prepared to lead your

generation to heights where no,

Y

man shall make it afraid,’ urged
Dr. Francis P. Gaines before the
Scholars’ Day assembly in Memo-
rial Hall Monday.

At the program outstanding stu-
dents were tapped to,_ 16 honorary
fraternities, and 12 special awards
were presented as recognition of
scholastic attainment.

Dr. Gaines spoke on “The Vestibule
of Scholarship,” and told of “the pre-
dominant attitude of fear” in this
generation.

YOUTH PESSIMISTIC

At the present time youth has a
pessimistic attitude toward life; he
knows how futile have been the sac-
riﬁes of the worlds gone by; he real-
izes how great catastrophes might
arise out of a trivial incident, ex-
plained Dr. Gaines.

“The completion of the realm ahead
forms a vestibule to despair,” assert-
ed Dr. Gaines, “and all programs and
patterns have been tried and have
failed.”

When the University was founded,
in 1787, the people were familiar with
the hopes of democracy. To be young
was wonderful, because men believed
that democracy held the ways and
means to happiness, Dr. Gaines point-
ed out.

“Now democracy has disappeared
in many countries and in our own we
are working desperately to see
whether we can maintain it,” he con-
tinued.

LOST DREAM

Scholarship can re-discover a
dream which has been lost to man-
kind. The dream of a worthy world,
safe and secure must be restored, de-
clared Dr. Gaines.

He believes that scholars should
dedicate themselves to bring ‘the
dream back again in terms of those
things which can give it a promise of
validity.

Dr. Gaines said in closing, “A world
is possible in which there would be
no fear, one in which plows would
take the place of swords. That world
shall be reached by a simple pre-
scription: Work humbly, love jus-
tice.”

Francis Durkin, BA39, chairman of
the Scholars’ Day committee, was as-
sisted by: Robert Adams, C40, Robert
Jacobs, BA39, Stella Kaplan, C39 and
Falk Arnheim, C39. Faculty advisers
were Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men. and Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
Women.

,!Sudan School Teacher Attends

University as Graduate Student

M
V

By Murelle Russell

Attending schools located in three
widely separated countries has been
the experzence of Miss Frances Turk,
who is now taking graduate courses
in child psychology at the Univer-
sity.

American students are fortunate,
says Miss Turk, who is a native of
Austria and attended school in that
country. Freedom of the press, that
we in America prize so highly, is
unknown there, according to her.
Students are not considered as indi-
viduals, but as cozs in a wheel, Miss
Turk said, “The whole thing is me-
chanical.”

Yet, she added. it is a privilege to
be able to go to school in Austria.
Education is compulsory up to the
age of twelve, after that students
must pay tuition to enter high
school. Economic conditions are ex-
tremely bad just now, and unless a
youth has ﬁnancial support or social
prestige, he will get little schooling.

For 16 years Miss Turk, has been
public health nurse at a school in
Khaitoun, capital city of the Sudan,
Africa. This school, which is the
largest and oldest in that part of the
country, has an enrollment of about
300 pupils.

Children of kindergarten age up
through the twelfth grade are taught
Arabic as well as English. Girl stu-
dents receive specialized training in
home arts. Most of the children are
negroes, but there are also Arab and
European children in the school.

Miss Turk left Austria at the age
of nine. and ﬁnished her schooling in

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 1939

Colorado. Later she came to Pitts-
burgh to take nurse’s training at the
Columbia and Children’s hospitals.

At present she is on a furlough of
one year. This leave of absence ex-
pires in June.

.Alumnae to Hold 3
Essay Contest I

New York alumnae of 23 nation-
al wo1nen’s fraternities have an-
nounced an essay contest devoted
to a consideration of America’s
“four freedoms.”

First prize will be a trip to the

New York World’s Fair, with a

' one week’s all-expense stay at the
Hotel Beekman Tower. Second
and third prizes are cash awards
of $25 and $15 respectively.

The committee is attempting to
focus attention on the “four free-
doms” of the Bill of Rights free-
dom of speech, of the press, of
worship and or peaceful assembly.

Many nationally known men and
women have submitted questions
which will be used as topics to be
discussed.

Men and women, fraternity or
non-fraternity, are eligible to sub-
mit compositions. Students at ap-
proximately 846 schools are ex-
pected to participate.

Further information may be ob-
tained from the committee’s head-
quarters at the Hotel Beekman
Tower, 3 Mitchell Place, New York
City.
